 Aristotle's simulation theory is a reaction to Plato's simulation theory at one level and its development at another level
 mahaan darshanik plato ne kala or kavy ko satya se tihari duuri par kahkar uskaa mahatv bahut kam kar diya tha
 His disciple Aristotle included reconstruction in imitation
 unke anusaar anukaran hoobahoo nakal nahin he balki punah prastutikaran he jisamen punarrachana bhi shaamil hoti he
 Through imitation, the artist recognizes the universal and tries to reconstruct it in a simple and in-depth manner
 kavi pratiyaman sambhavya athwa adarsh teenon main se kisi kaa bhi anukaran karne ke liye swatantra he
 He makes the imperfect complete by sensation, knowledge, imagination, ideal etc
 yahan ek jigyaasa swaabhaavik rup se hoti he ki arestu ne kavy-vivechan main anukaran ko itnaa mahatv kyon diya? is sandarbh main nimnlikhit kaarnon kaa ullekh kiya ja saktaa he- ;1ddh arestu se purv unke guru plato ne kavy tathaa anya kalaon ko anukriti vyapaar darshan se sambaddh hone ke kaaran hin mana tha
 Aristotle accepted him only in relation to poetry and creation
 isse unhone anukaran kaa arth or uski dhvaniyon ko parivartit kar diya
 ; 2 Aristotle has explicitly called illustration and poetry as Plato
 ;3ddh arestu kavy main traasadee ko sarvaadhik mahatvapurn kavy ke rup main maanate hai unka samast kavy-vivechan traasadee ke vivechan ke sandarbh main hua he
 Imitation has precedence in tragedy, so it is natural for Aristotle to have prominence in imitation of poetry
 ;4ddh greek bhashaa main kavi ke liye ‘poetes’ shabd kaa prayog hua he jiskaa vyutpatyrth he- kartta yaa rachayita
 The poet can be considered a performer, not a performer of events
 is prakaar anukaran kii pradhanta kaa sambandh ‘poetes’ ke vyutpatyrth se jud jaataa he
 Many critics have interpreted Aristotle in different ways, but one thing everyone agrees that Aristotle did not use imitation as a platonic replica like Plato
 ye vyakhyaayein apane aap main mahatvapurn hai
 Nevertheless, it would be expedient to consider the words of Aristotle as proof
 kala prakruti kii anukriti he
 This is the basic formula for discussing both the arts and imitation elements
 yahan anukaran kii apeksha prakruti shabd kaa adhik vivechy he
 On the basis of Horace, neoclassicists interpreted nature as meaning - policy, a life bound by rules and imitation - consistent transcription, thus this formula of Aristotle became a motivational mantra of ritualized poetry
 kintu prakruti ke arth ko is prakaar simit karne kaa koi kaaran nahin he
 Here, nature is synonymous with the whole form of life, ie, the inbred, the collective of both forms
 isamen sthoolgochar rup arestu ko abhipret nahin he, arthath manwetar prakruti kaa anukaran karnaa anukaranaatmak kala kaa naam nahin he
 The poet or artist follows the surgeon process of nature
 anukaran kaa vishyagochar vastuen na hokar unamem nihit prakruti-niyam he
 Therefore, according to Aristotle, "what happens when every thing is fully developed, we call it its nature
" ’’ prakruti is adarsh rup kii uplabdhi kii ore nirantar karyrat rahati he
 But due to many reasons, she is not able to achieve her goal
 anukaran main prakruti ke in abhaavon ko kala dwaara puraa kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus imitation is a surgeon-verb
 kavy-kala prakruti kii sarjan-prakriya anukaran karti hui prakruti ke adhure kaary ko purna karti he
 This is the importance of imitation element in poetry
 arestu ke anusaar anukaran main teen prakaar kii vastuon main se koi ek ho sakati he- jaise ve thim yaa he jaisi ve kahi yaa samajhi jaati hai, jaise ve honi chahie 
 These have been considered as seeming, sambhaya and ideal forms respectively
 kavi ko yah swatantrata he ki vah vastu yaa vishay ko us rup main chitrit kare jaisi vah uski indriyon ko prathit hoti he athwa bhavishya main prathit ho sakati he athwa honi chahie
 Certainly, the poet's spirit and imagination will contribute to it - it will not be merely a copy
 isi se arestu kaa anukaran siddhanth-bhaavana or kalpanayukta anukaran ko maanakar chalata he, shuddh prakruti ko nahin
 In order to prove his ideas regarding poetic truth, Aristotle has considered poetry and history in comparative terms
 is tathy ko bujar ne is prakaar spasht kiya he- That is, not to describe what has happened to the poet-deeds, but to describe what can happen - whatever is possible under the rule of possibility or inevitability - to describe it
 


 kavi or itihaaskaar main gadhy or padya lekhan ke kaaran bhed nahin he
 xxrep 5 
 but the real difference in them is that one describes what has happened and the other describes what may have happened
 isliye kavita itihaas se adhik shreshth he, kyonki kavita saarvbhaum kaa chithran karti he, jabaki itihaas vishesh kaa
 '' arestu ke matanusaar, ‘‘kavi or itihaaskaar main vaastavik bhed yah he ki ek to uskaa varnan karata he jo ghatit ho chukaa he or doosraa uskaa varnan karata he jo ghatit ho saktaa he
 Consequently, there is more philosophicalism in poetry
 uskaa swaroop itihaas se bhavyatar he, kyonki kavy saamaanya kii abhivyakti he or itihaas vishesh kii
 "the events of history are confined to us only in their separate and distinct form, beyond the boundary of country-time, while the poetic facts are expressed in their universal form
" atah unki punrariti sambhavit hoti he
 Thus poetry and history are related to simulation and not to objective objective attribution
 arestu ne traasadee ke vivechan main likhaa he ki traasadee manushyon kaa nahin varan kaary or jivan kaa anukaran karti he
 He has used the word 'work' in the sense of the picture of human life
 unke anusaar jo kuch bhi maanav-jivan ke aantarik paksh ko vyakt kare, buddhisammat vyaktitv kaa udghaatan kare, vah sabhi kuch ‘kaary’ ke antargat aayega
 Therefore, the meaning of action is not only the actions of man, but also his expressions, thoughts, character, etc
, which are responsible for karma
 atah anukaran kaa vishay he- kriyasheel maanav
 Aristotle's view is that the joy derived from a favorable object is no less universal - "the form presented by imitating the things whose direct vision hurts us brings us joy
" daraavne jaanavar dekhne se hamen dar lagata he, kintu unka anukool rup hamen anand praapt karata he
 "therefore, the meaning of imitation joy is inherent in it, that the revelation of self-essence is contained in it, because the achievement of joy is not possible without the revelation of self-realization
 atah anukaran nishchay hi yatharth vastuparak ankan na hokar bhavatmak or kalpanaatmak hoga
 But even if there is harmony between the sentiment and the self contained in it, imitation is not synonymous with pure self-expression, because the primordial element is essential in it
 aadhunik aalochana shaastra kii shabdaawalee kaa aashray lekar kahen to anukaran main abhijaat kala ke vastu-parak bhav-tatva kii hi sweekruti he, kintu ramyadbhut kala ke vyaktiparak bhav-tatva kii nahin
 In this way, the conscience of the poet created from the sensations of life has not got enough importance in it
 anukaran main jin vishyon kaa vivechan hota he ve sabhi sthool va sookshm hote hue bhi anukaarya hai, parastha hai
 His position is out of favor
 atah anukaran ko vyaktiparak anubhuti ke abhaav main shuddh atmabhivyanjan kii koti main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 The question is, how far is the prevalence of simulation theory? How can the emergence of personal experiences of policy poetry come under the purview of imitation? Aristotle has neglected the Gitikavya
 geet ko unhone kavy kaa alankaar maatr mana he
 Aristotle's biographer also argues that just as in tragedy it is possible to emulate the sensations of another, similarly it is possible to imitate their sensations in lyrical poetry
 kintu jo swayan abhivyakt rup hai, uske anukaran kaa prashn hi nahin uthta
 Therefore, it is not possible to expand the meaning of the word imitation so that lyrical poetry can be included within its periphery, that is its limitation
 anukaran siddhanth kaa kroche ke sahjanubhuti siddhanth se bhi saakshaat virodh he
 According to Croche, the fundamental form of poetic art cannot be a subject of imitation, and its tangible form, which is the subject of imitation, according to Croche is entirely incidental
 arestu ke anukaran siddhanth main kisi bhi prakaar sahjanubhuti kaa samavesh nahin ho saktaa
 Therefore, the degree to which Croche's innate cognition principle is valid, to the same degree, the simulation principle is invalid
 dow nagendra ne anukaran siddhanth kaa vivechan karte hue spasht kiya he ki srijan or anukaran main bhed he
 In poetry, it is poet-karma to expose the essence of things in an attractive way
 iske do paksh hai- vastu ke marm kaa darshan or uski shabdon main abhivyakti ye donon paksh abhinn hai
 Poetry is a coordinated action of both, not imitation
 kavi kii pratibha karyitri he anukaryitri nahin
 The poet inaugurates the poignant form of cosmic substances
 isi se kavy navnirmaan he, srijan he, anukaran nahin
 In fact, the poet adds his perspective to the experience in life and this approach is the creation-element
 isi se anukaran shabd kaa arth vistaar ho gaya he
 Conclusion - Truth is never monogamous
 uski uplabdhi to kisi-na-kisi rup main hoti jaati he, kintu uplabdhi kii vidhi or uskaa aadharbhoot drushtikon bhi kam mahattvuparn nahin hota
 Aristotle considered poetry or art to be an imitation of nature
 atah kala anukaran hote hue bhi naveekaran he, srijan rup he

 Chromosomes or chromosomes are fibrous nodules found in cells of all flora and fauna, which determine and transmit all genetic properties
 prayek prajati main gunasutron kii sankhya nishchit rahati hai
 The number of chromosomes in a human cell is 46, in pairs of 23
 iname se 22 gunasutra nar or maadaa main samaan or apane-apane jode ke samajaat hote he
 These are collectively called homologous chromosomes
 23wein jode ke gunasutra stri or purush main samaan nahin hote jinhe vishamjaat gunasutra kehete he
 In the structure of a chromosome, two substances are specifically incorporated - di en e hi anuvanshik padaarth he
 The structure of the DNA molecule consists of four organic compounds: two purines, two pyrimidines, one sugar-deoxyribose, and phosphoric acid
 purine main adinine or guanin hote he or pirimidine main thymin or cytosin 
 a molecule of DNA has two formulas, which ring around each other in a spiral form
 prayek di en e sutara main ek ke peeche ek chaaron carbonic samaakshar is kram se hote hai-thymin, cytosin, adinin or guanin, evam ve paraspar ek vishesh dhang se jude hote hai
 a unit of these four chambers and their related sugars and phosphoric acid molecule is a tetranucleotid and a DNA molecule is formed of several millennium tetranucleotids
 vibhinn praaniyon ke di en e kii vibhinnata kaa kaaran he - samaakshaaron ke anukram main antar hona
 DNA and a similar nucleic acid RNA combine with ultraviolet in the region of most 2,600 angstroms due to the presence of organic clear
 isi aadhaar par di en e kaa ek koshika sambandhi maatraatmak aagaman kiya jaataa he
 Two special types of centrosomes are found in beings
 ek to kuch deptra insecta main dimbhiy largranthi ke centrakon main paaya jaataa he
 These chromosomes are several hundred times longer and wider than ordinary chromosomes of the same species
 is kaaran inhen mahagunasutra kehete hai
 Their structure appears to be somewhat different from the simple centrosome and semisolid centers
 yahan ek gunasutra ke sthaan par ek anuprastha pankti aisi kanikaon kii hoti he jinamein abhiranjit hote kii yogyata adhik hoti hai
 All the corpuscles of many such transverse rows from one end of the chromosome to the other are identical and the corpuscles of the other rows have characteristics and differences
 in gunasutron ke adhik lambey hone ke kaaran yah samajha jaataa he ki inkaa purna rup se visarpelikaran hota he or kadachit protein kaa kuch badhaav bhi hota hai
 The reason for being wider is that a chromosome synthesizes another nucleus similar to its own
 saadhaaran avasthaa main samasutran ke samay ye donon sutara ek duusare se pruthak ho jate hai, parantu mahagunasutra main yah nahin hota
 The two sutras remain connected to each other
 mahagunasutra kii sankhya saadhaaran gunasutra kii sankhya kii aadhi hoti he, kyonki prayek sutara apane samaan duusare sutara se yugmit ho jaataa he
 This phenomenon is called somatic coupling
 jantuon main vicitra prakaar kaa ek or bhi gunasutra paaya jaataa he
 Its lampbrush is called chromosome
 ye gunasutra aise jantuon ke andon ke centrakon main paae jate hai jinamein andpit kii maatra adhik hoti he, jaise machhlee, ubhaychar, urag, pakshigan ityadi
 The chromosomes are made up of two coupled formulas similar to ordinary diplotene-diakinisis chromosomes
 donon yugmit sutara kuch sthanon par ek duusare se jude hote hai or shesh sthanon par ek duusaren se dur dur rahete hai
 These joints are considered kijma
 prayek sutara par, jisakon chromonima kehete hai, sthaan sthaan par vibhinn parisaan kii kanikas hoti hai jinako chromemrs kehete hai
 Each chromomier has a pair or more lateral clusters attached
 parshvapash bhi chromonima ke sadrush sutara kaa bana hota he, parantu iske chaaron ore rebonuclio-protein kanikas ekatrit ho jaati hai jisase ye sutara mote dikhaai dete hai
 Chromomers also breed with chromonima
 centrekaayen vishesh gunasutra par utpann hoti hai
 In most cells each chromosome has two integral clusters
 paripakv lingakoshikaon main ek kulak rah jaataa he
 Such animals and cells are said to be diploid, but some animals, especially plants, have more than two kulas of chromosomes
 yadi kisi dwiguneet praani ke cendraksutra dugune ho jaae, jisase uski koshikaaye main prayek sutara chaar chaar hon jaise, to aise praani kaa atopoliploid kehete hai
 If the chromosome of a diploid hybrid is doubled, such a creature is called an allopolyploid
 yadi ek dwiguneet praani kaa, jiskicendraksutra k1 k1 kha1 kha1 ga1 ga1 ityadi hai, kisi duusare praani se, jiske gunasutra k2 k2 kha2 kha2 ga2 ga2 ityadi hai, sankaran kiya jaae to uski santan ke gunasutra k1 k2 kha1 kha2 ga1 ga2 ityadi honge
 A1 a2 b1 b2 etc
 will be different from each other and there will not normally be coupling
 yadi is praani ke gunasutra dugune ho jaae to unki koshikaaye main k1 k1 k2 k2; kha1 kha1kha2 kha2; ga1 ga1 ga2 ga2, ityadi gunasutra honge
 This will be called allopolyploid
 poliploid main chaar se adhik kulak bhi ho sakate hai
 It is clear that the autopolyploid will produce quadruplexes in the zygotein state, because each of the four chromosomes of each type is present, and the coupling of the four formulas creates one quadrupole
 koshikavibhaajan ke samay prayek dhruv ko baraabar baraabar sankhya main gunasutra nahin milenge
 Often it happens that three threads reached a pole due to the breakdown of a quadrilateral and only one thread reached its opposite pole
 koshikavibhaajan ke ant par bane hue santati koshikaon main gunasutra yaa to adhik sankhya main honge yaa kam main or aise asantulan kaa parinaam yah hota he ki koshika mar jaati he
 This is why autotetraploids are much less fertile
 autotetraploid paudhe saadhaaran dwiguneet paudhon se bahut bade hote hai tathaa unke beej bhi bahut bade hote hai, jisase urvartaa kam hone par bhi ye gruhasthi ke liye adhik laabhadaayak siddh ho sakate hai
 By providing frost, or with the effect of some alkaloids, plant autopolyploids can be made
 elotetraploid main dasha iske vipareet hoti hai
 If the two primitive parent formulas are completely different from each other, the allopolyploid is functionally diploid and will be completely fertile
 jaise, yadi kisi sankar main k1 k2, kha1 kha2, ga1 ga2 se sutara sarvatha bhinn hon to aisa sankar bandhya hoga, parantu iske gunasutron ke dugune hone se yah avasthaa badal jaaygi
 Such cells will have formulas such as A1, 1A, 2A2, B1B1B2B2, C1C1, C2C2, etc
 and the branches that contain such cells will flower, because such cells will have successful myiotic division, coupled with A1A1, B1B1, etc
 
 datura stramonium main dwiguneet avasthaa main 12 jodi gunasutra hote hai or ardhasuthran ke samay dwisanyojak banate hai
 Its autopolyploid has 12 quaternary chromosomes and at the time of meiosis, 12 quiescent are formed
 isi bhanti primmula sinencis se dwiguneet paudhe main 12 jodi gunasutra hote hai or autotetraploid main 48 sutara hote hai evam ardhasuthran ke samay isamen 9 se 11 chatu:sanyojak or 2 se 6 tak dwisanyojak banate hai
 The diploid of Solomon lycopersicon has 12 pair chromosomes and its autotetraploid has 12 quaternary chromosomes
 ye sab paudhe hai
 The creepis rubra and araepis foetida have 5 pairs of chromosomes
 inke sutara ek duusare se bahut bhinn nahin hote or inke sankaran se utpann sankar main ardhsutran ke samay 5 dwisanyojak banate hai
 Its allopolyploid consists of 20 centrioles and in meiosis there are 0 to 5 quadruple connectives and 0 to 10 divisors
 spasht he ki elotetraploid bahut urvar nahin hoga
 Primula floribanda and Primula resticillata both have nine pair of chromosomes, which are often identical
 inke sankaran se jo sankar banaata he uske prituja kivensis kehete hai
 It also has 9 pairs of chromosomes
 ardhasuthran ke samay main yugman kriya safal hoti he or 9 dwisanyojak banate hai
 The allopolyploid formed by the diploid of the formulas has 9 quaternary formulas and in such plants 12 to 18 are divalent and 0 to 3 quadruple
 spasht he ki chatu:sanyojaakon kii sankhya bahut kam he or kabhi kabhi ek bhi chatu:sanyojak nahin banataa
 Radish and Karamkalla each have 9 pairs of chromosomes, which are completely different from each other
 inke sankaran se utpann sankar refanas brasika main bhi 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai; parantu ardhasuthran main ek hi dwisanyojak nahin banataa, kyonki yugman kii kriya safal nahin hoti or sabhi sutara ayugmit rah jate hai jisase 12 ek-sanyojak banate hai
 The allotetraploid resulting from its formula diploid consists of 12 pair formulas and the meiosis consists of 12 valence, quadrilateral none
 parinaam yah hota he ki refanas-brasika-elotetraploid bahut urvar hota he, yadhyapi refanas-brasika-dwiguneet bandhya hota he
 Polyploidy is rarely found in animals, but it is most often found in non-sterile animals
 paudhon main bahut si nai jatiyaan poliploid ke kaaran utpann hui hongi
 This is evidenced by the fact that about half of the species of angiosperms are such that the number of chromosomes of mature gametes is multiplied by the number of alleles of a related race
 gehun kii kai jatiyaan hai
 The basic zygote center number of these castes is 7
 gunasutron kii sankhya gehun kii jatiyon main 7 kii guneet 14,21,42 tathaa 49 tak pai jaati he
 Similarly, the number of chromosomes in different species of tobacco is 12 or 12 multiplied by 24
 paudhon main prayog dwaara bahut se poliploid banaae gaye hai, jinamein ekaatmak sutron ke do kulak hote hai
 They are fertile

 The cells of the renal tubule extract the urea from the blood and the liver cells converge to glucose by converting them into glycogen
 spasht he ki kisi bhi praani kii prayek koshika main uske sab jin saadhaarant: upasthit hote hai
 Therefore, at the origin of different types of proteins of different types of cells, some suitable genes must have been active and the rest have become inactive and the same thing will happen with respect to their activation

 This document stated that the specific basic characteristics of the Constitution cannot be changed by amendment
 The Indian Parliament attempted to remove this limit, for this the Act of the Twenty-second Amendment was made, according to which "there shall be no limit in the powers of Parliament for amendment of this Constitution xxrep 7 
 "
 However, later This change was declared invalid by the Supreme Court in Minerva Mills v

 amarsingh rathod marwar rajya ke prasiddh rajput the
 He was the courtier of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan of India in the 17th century
 apane parivaar dwaara nirvasit karne ke baad wo mughalon kii seva main aaye
 His famous bravery and fighting ability resulted in him receiving royal honor and personal recognition by the emperor
 jiske baad unhen nagaur kaa subedaar banaaya gaya or baad main unhone hi yahan shashan kiya
 In his unauthorized absence in 1644, the emperor was angered by taxation and slapped Salabat Khan with a sword responsible for taking the tax
 unka varnan rajasthan, pashchimi uttar pradesh or punjab ke kuch lokgito main prasiddhi praapt he
 Raja Gaj Singh was the ruler of the Marwar region under the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan
 unke putr amar singh rathod ek mahaan yoddha or ek deshbhakt the, lekin unke pita ne unhen mughalon se ek daaku ko bachaane ke kaaran rajya se nirvasit kar diya tha
 He later joined Shah Jahan's Delhi Sultanate where he impressed Shah Jahan with his valor
 jisase unhen nagaur kaa jagirdaar banaaya gaya
 However, Salabat Khan, brother of the Emperor, was jealous of the rise of Amar Singh Rathore in the kingdom and was waiting for an opportunity to discredit Amar Singh
 unhen jald hi yah mauka mil gaya jab amar singh kii anadhikrut anupasthiti ke bare main kuch choti si chizon ke bare main pataa chalaa
 Salabat Khan raised it so much as an issue that Shah Jahan ordered the punishment of Amar Singh from Salabat
 iskaa phayda uthaate hue, salaabat ne amar singh ko dhamka kar usee vakt dand kaa bhugtan karne ko kaha
 Salabat also warned that he would not let Amar Singh go without paying the penalty
 amar singh ne apni talwaar baahar nikaali or salaabat ko maukey par maut ke ghat utaar diya
 Emperor Shah Jahan was also taken aback by the incident and ordered his troops to kill Amar Singh
 haalanki, bahadur amar ne apane yuddh kaushal ko dikhaaya or un sabhi ko maar daalaa jinhone unpar akraman kiya tha
 He quickly fled the fort and returned to a safe place
 agle din adaalat main samraat ne ghoshnaa kii ki amar singh ko maarane vaale ko jagirdaar bana diya jayega haalanki koi bhi amar singh rathore ke saath dushmani mol lene ke liye taiyaar nahin tha, kyonki unhen sirf ek din pehle hi amar singh krodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Arjun Singh, who was Amar Singh's brother-in-law, greedily accepted the challenge
 arjunasingh ne amarsingh se kaha ki shahjahan ko apni galati kaa ehsaas ho gaya he or ve amarsingh jaisaa yoddha nahin khona chahta
 Though Amar Singh did not believe in the beginning, he soon got caught in the art of betrayal of Arjun Singh
 is bich, shahjahan kii adaalat ke saamne ek chota darwaja khadaa kiya gaya tha, jisase amar singh ko adaalat main pravesh karne ke liye uske saamne jhukna padegaa
 Seeing Amar's acts first and the proceedings in court, a curious fakir asked the emperor "how can we conquer Hindustan with so many warriors" Shah Jahan said, "wait and see how we will do"
 amar samraat ke saamne jhukne ke liye taiyaar nahin tha or arjunasingh ne ye jaan liya
 He asked Amar Singh to enter first
 amar ne unki salaah maan lee, arjunasingh duusari taraf se aayaa or amar singh kii chaati main khanjar ghonp diya ,amar singh vahi par veergati ko praapt hue
 So Arjun Singh cut off his head and took it to the emperor
 raja ne fakir kii ore ishaara kiya or kaha "ab tumhen pataa he ki hamane yoddhaon se kaise chhutkaaraa dilaayaa"
 Later Shah Jahan also killed Arjun Singh
 amar singh kii mrityu kii soochna par, unki patni ,bhallu singh or ram singh ke netritv main rajput sainikon ke saath kile par hamalaa kiya jahaan amar singh kaa sharir padaa tha
 However, thousands of Mughal soldiers surrounded the Rajput forces
 bahadur rajput balon ne unhen virodh kiya jab tak amar singh ke sharir ko kile se dur nahin liya gaya
 Although all those Rajput fighters dedicated their lives to death, they never bowed down to the Mughal Sultanate
 baad main, kile main sankeern darwaja lokapriy rup se amar singh darwaja ke rup main janaa jane laga kyonki yah muslim sena ke upar rajput bahaduree kaa pratik tha
 Some historians claim that Shah Jahan ordered the door to be closed permanently as it reminded him of his defeat at the hands of Rajput forces

 The floor is the part of the building that is used for walking
 kachi mitti ke farsh se lekar aadhunik takanic se bane bahu-stareey farsh tak anekon prakaar ke farsh hote hai
 Good floors not only enhance the beauty of the building, but it can be easily kept clean and tidy
 farsh pathar, lakdi, baans, dhaatu yaa kancreet aadi kii ho sakati he
 Usually, the floor has two parts - the lower part, which is designed to withstand load, and the upper floor which is good for walking and looks beautiful
 aadhunik bhawanon main farsh ke neeche hi bijli ke taar, pani ke pipe aadi bichaaye gayi hote hai
 There are many types of flooring and there is also a great difference in the value of construction, such as the price of raw flooring and marble flooring
 nimnlikhit prakaar ke farsh bharat main adhiktar upyog main aate hai : Floors are made at a little height from the ground, that is, at the height of the pedestal of the building, to protect it from the moisture of the ground and from the water in the rain
 kursii main mitti kii bharaai khub thos honi chahie
 After which this soil does not get trapped by getting burdened, otherwise the floor will break and cracks will occur
 is prakaar ke farsh sabase adhik prachlit hai tathaa sundar, chikne or svachh hote hai tathaa aasaani se dhoe ja sakate hai
 Mozoic or tarazo floors are made by adding colored cement and black and white marble gravel
 rang tathaa vibhinn tarah kii bajri ke sammishran se bade sundar tathaa kai abhikalp ke farsh banaae ja sakate hai
 On which polished, it gives great smoothness and shine
 aajkal achche makaanon main is tarah ke farsh kaa upyog bahut bad gaya he
 The cement floor is mostly 1 inch to one and a half inch thick, and below this, 3 inch thick folded lime ballast is given, which should be solidified by crushing them thoroughly with durmut etc
 chooney kii gitti ke neeche bhi agar baaluu yaa raakh kii 6 inch moti tah bicha di jaae, to yah nami ko rokane main kaaphi sahaayak hoti he
 Where there is a great fear of damping, cement can be used in appropriate amounts of putative spices, chico, or other moisture retardant spices
 cement kaa farsh puure kamare main ek saath na daalkar lagbhag 4 foot x 4 foot kii pattiyon ke rup main daalane se kancreet sookhne ke samay farsh ke fatne kaa bhay nahin rahata
 When the cement concrete water dries, the concrete shrinks slightly, which causes the possibility of the floor bursting
 agar chaar paanch foot par farsh main jod de die jaaen, to na jodon main thodi si zairi bad jaaegi or tedi medhi daraaren nahin padengi
 Baking of concrete is very important to keep the floor from bursting
 farsh daalane ke kuch ghante ke baad choti choti meden banaakar farsh ke upar pani bhar kar, kam se kam 8-10 din tak pakaai kerani chahie
 If possible, seasoning should be done for 15 days
 farsh main jo jod banaae jate hai, unke bich aluminium yaa evonite kii pattee farsh kii motaai ke baraabar laga dene se jod bahut saaf or sidhe banate hai
 In the making of mosaic or tarazo floors, a three-inch thick layer of lime clay should be laid on top of the cement concrete, on top of it a flat layer of 1: 3 cement and marble gravel spices are laid flat
 teen din baad farsh kii ragadai carborandam pathar kii batiya se kii jaati he
 After the grinding is complete, it is finely rubbed with a carborundum purse
 rangeen farsh ke liye bane banaae rangeen cement bazaar main milte hai
 Cement tiles make many factories
 yah adhiktar 8 inch x 8 inch hoti he
 On the lime ballast floor, the tiles are rooted by cement spices
 phir ragadai or paalish usee prakaar hoti he, jaise mozik ke farsh par
 Such tiles are made by baking porcelain clay in a high heat furnace and then glazing over it by special chemical reaction
 ye safed athwa rangeen abhikalp ke bhi hote hai
 White tiles are mostly used in bathrooms etc
 mozik kaa upyog badhane se is prakaar ke tilon kaa upyog kam hota ja rahaa he
 Marble has been in use for flooring since ancient times
 mukhyat: mughal kaal main farsh tathaa bhavannirmaan main iskaa prayog bahut hone laga tha
 It has also been used in a large number in Italy
 sangemarmar kii chaudee chaudee patiyon ko vibhinn naapon main tarashkar, jameen main chooney yaa cement kii gitti ke upar jadkar, farsh banaaya jaataa he
 Black and white marble strips are made one by one, inlaid, with a beautiful sample of Shatranji flooring

 Sandstone, granite and slate are used to make floors
 balua pathar kaa mukhya udhaaharan agre kaa laal pathar he jo agre, dilli ityadi ke kilon main mughalkaal main, prachur maatra main istemaal kiya gaya
 It cannot be polished well
 bharat ke dakshini pradeshon main granite khub miltaa he
 It is very hard stone and it is difficult to carve and also expensive
 yadi granite par polish kiya jaae to yah khub chikna tathaa chamakdaar banaaya ja saktaa he
 Granite is brindled and of different colors
 at: dakshin bharat main achche farsh ke liye iskaa upyog karte hai
 Due to the strength and hardness of granite, it is also used in heavy factories where cement floors are not very durable
 shahabaadi pathar ke chauke kaa farsh bhi kaaphi prasiddh he
 Brick is used to make cheap flooring
 eent kii pat yaa khadi judai kii jaati he
 The brick floor is not as smooth and flat and clean as cement, but is much cheaper
 chooney kii gitti kaa farsh pehle bahut banataa tha, par jaise jaise cement kaa upyog badhata gaya, chooney kii gitti kaa farsh bananaa kam hota gaya
 It is not as smooth and hard as the cement floor and water can also absorb so much, so the fear of its burst is reduced
 isliye praaia: iskaa upyog khuli chat par farsh daalane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The wooden floor is made by inlaying wooden rails or planks on a wooden picket or iron girder
 aise farsh adhiktar pahaad par, yaa aisi jagahon par banaae jate hai jahaan lakdi sasti or adhik milti he
 The wood floor is not as frosty as the cement or stone floor, so it is used abundantly in the cold climate
 aise sthaan par thandhi jalwaayu ke kaaran lakdi jaldi sadati bhi nahin
 For wooden flooring it is necessary that the soil is not filled under it, otherwise the wood will rot quickly due to damping
 dharan ke neeche kii jameen khaali rakhi jaati he, jisase sukhi hawa kaa sanvathan ho sake
 Polishing the wood, polishing the varnish or wax increases the lifespan, beauty and cleanliness of the wood floor
 parket farsh lakdi ke hi farsh kii ek kism he, jo bahut sundar lagati he
 The floors are made a little flexible by applying iron springs under the wooden floor in the dance halls
 is prakaar ke farsh bhi kaaphi mahange padate hai
 In villages where kachcha houses are built, most of the floors are also kutcha, that is, of mud
 kachche farsh ke banane main chikani mitti, bhusa tathaa gobar kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The floors of the factories have to be made stronger than the floor of the minor buildings
 aavashyaktaanusaar cement kancreet kii tah ko kam se kamash inch se 3 inch tak motaa rakhana padataa he
 Granite blocks are also used where heavy load on the floor or vehicles of heavy iron wheels are used, although the movement of the vehicle on them greatly increases the rattle and noise and does not provide good cleaning of the floor
 jahaan adhik shor ho vahaan bitumen kaa farsh bhi banaaya ja saktaa he
 In some places linoleum is also used for flooring, such as in kitchens, galleries or other places
 iske upyog se aawaaj bhi kam hoti he
 In our country, linoleum is mostly used for making floor of train coaches
 sikh dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Guru Gobind Singh was the tenth Guru of the Sikhs
 unke pita guru teg bahadur kii mrityu ke uparant 11 navambar san 1675 ko ve guru bane
 He was a great warrior, poet, devotee and spiritual leader

 Guru Gobind Singh completed the Guru Granth Sahib, the sacred text of the Sikhs, and embellished them as a Guru
 bichitra naatak ko unki aatmakatha mana jaataa he
 This is the most important source of information about his life
 yah dasam granth kaa ek bhaag he
 The Dasam Granth is the name of a compilation of the works of Guru Gobind Singh
 unhone mughalon yaa unke sahyogiyon ke saath 14 yuddh lade
 He sacrificed the entire family for the sake of religion, for which he is also known as 'sarvasvadani'
 iske atirikt jansadharan main ve kalgidhar, dashamesh, bazaanvaale aadi kai naam, upnaam va oopaadhiyon se bhi jane jate hai

 His childhood name was Govind Rai
 patna main jis ghar main unka janm hua tha or jisamen unhone apane pratham chaar varsh bitaaye the, vahiin par ab takhat shri patna sahib sthit he
 In 1670, his family returned to Punjab
 march 1672 main unka parivaar himalay ke shivalik pahadiyon main sthit chakk nanaki naamak sthaan par aa gaya
 It was here that his education started
 unhone farsi, sanskrit kii shiksha lee or ek yoddha banane ke liye sainya kaushal siikhaa
 Chak Nanaki is now called Anandpur Sahib
 govind raay ji nity prati anandpur sahab main aadhyatmik anand baantate, maanav maatr main naitikta, nidarta tathaa aadhyatmik jagriti kaa sandesh dete the
 Anandpur was virtually Anand Dham
 yahan par sabhi log varna, rang, jati, sampradaay ke bhedbhaav ke bina samta, samanta evam samarasata kaa alokik gyaan praapt karte the
 Govind ji was the idol of peace, forgiveness and tolerance

 unka ek betaa hua jiskaa naam tha ajit singh
 On 15 April 1700, at the age of 33, he married Mata Sahib Devan
 vaise to unka koi santan nahin tha par sikh dharm ke pannon par unka daur bhi bahut prabhaavshaalee rahaa
 In April 1685, at the invitation of Raja Mat Prakash of Sirmour this Sirmour belongs to Himanchal pradesh, Guru Gobind Singh shifted his residence to Paonta town of Sirmaur state
 sirmaur rajya ke gajet ke anusaar, raja bhim chand ke saath matbhed ke kaaran guru ji ko anandpur sahib chhodane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya tha or ve vahaan se tokaa shahar chale gayi

 haalanki, ve jaswaal ke gaj singh se haar gaye the
 Such developments in the mountainous region became a cause of concern for the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and he sent forces with his son to restore Mughal authority in the area
 guru gobind singh ji kaa netritv sikh samudaay ke itihaas main bahut kuch nayaa le kar aayaa
 He created Khalsa, a collective form of Sikhism's duly initiated followers on the day of Baisakhi in 1699
 sikh samudaay ke ek sabha main unhone sabake saamne puchha – "koun apane sar kaa balidaan dena chahta he"? usee samay ek swayamsevak is baat ke liye raji ho gaya or guru gobind singh use tamboo main le gaye or kuch der baad waapas laute ek khun lage hue talwaar ke saath
 The Guru again asked the people of that crowd the same question again and likewise another person agreed and went with them but when they came out of the tent, the blood-stained sword was in their hands
 usee prakaar paanchavaa swayamsevak jab unke saath tamboo ke bheetar gaya, kuch der baad guru gobind singh sabhi jivit sevakon ke saath waapas laute or unhone unhen panj pyaare yaa pehle khalsa kaa naam diya
 After that Guru Gobind Ji took an iron bowl and mixed it with water and sugar and mixed it with a double-edged sword and gave it the name of Amrit
 pehle 5 khalsa ke banane ke baad unhen chhathvaan khalsa kaa naam diya gaya jiske baad unka naam guru gobind raay se guru gobind singh rakh diya gaya
 He explained the importance of the five kakaras for the Khalsa and said - kesha, comb, kadha, kirpan, kutkara
 idhar 27 disambar san 1704 ko donon chote sahibajaade or jorawatsingh va fatehsinghji ko deevaaron main chunavaa diya gaya
 When Guruji came to know about this, he wrote a Zafarnama to Aurangzeb, in which he warned Aurangzeb that the Khalsa Panth was ready to destroy your empire
 8 may san 1705 main 'muktsar' naamak sthaan par mughalon se bhayanak yuddh hua, jisamen guruji kii jeet hui
 In October 1706, Guruji went to the south where you came to know the death of Aurangzeb
 aurangzeb ne marate samay ek shikaayat patr likhaa tha
 Surprisingly, the one who had looted everything, he was writing the Fathnama and the one who had everything is writing a spurious Naama

 'therefore Lala Daulatrai has written a good book about Guru Govind Singhji called Purna Purush
 isi prakaar mohammad abdul latif bhi likhata he ki jab main guru govindsinghji ke vyaktitv ke bare main sochataa hoon to mujhe samaj main nahin aata ki unke kis pahalu kaa varnan karuun

 Ardra star circle picture taken from the European Space Organization's magnate niharika ke pados main ardra, balatrix or anya taare Space is an infinite, three-dimensional expansion in which objects and events occur and their relative position and direction
 bhautik antariksh aksar teen raikhik aayam kii tarah samajha jaataa he, haalanki aadhunik bhautikavid aamtaur par ise, samay ke saath, aseem chaar-aiami satatyak jise spes time kehete he, kaa ek bhaag samajhate hai
 In mathematics, 'space' is understood with different number of different structures and dimensions
 bhautik brahmad ko samajhane ke liye antariksh kii avadharana ko bahut mahatvapurn mana jaataa he haalanki darshanikon ke madhya is tathy ko lekar asahmati jari he ki yah swayan ek ikai he, yaa ikaayiyon ke madhya ek sambandh he, yaa vaicharik dhaanche kaa ek hissaa he
 During the early development of traditional mechanics, several philosophical questions were exposed in the 17th century
 isaac newton ke anusaar, antariksh nirpeksh tha - arthath yah sthaayee rup se astitv main he or is baat par nirbhar nahin karata he ki kya antariksh main koi vishaywastu thi yaa nahin
 Other natural philosophers, notably Gottfried Leibniz, instead thought that space was a collection of relations between objects, given by their distance and direction from each other
 18veen sadi main, immanuele kant ne antariksh or samay ko sanrachanaatmak dhaanche ke tatwon ke rup main varnit kiya he jisko manushya apane anubhav ke nirmaan hetu upyog karte he
 In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians started testing non-euclidean geometry in which space can be called curved rather than flat
 albert oinstin kaa saamaanya saapekshata siddhant ke anusaar gurutvkarshan kshetra ke aasapaas kaa antariksh euclidian antariksh se visaamaanya hota he
 Experimental tests of general relativity have confirmed that non-euclidean space provides a better model for optics and mechanics and for the interpretation of existing theories
 satrahavi shatabdi main, antariksh or samay kaa tatv-gyaan gyanamimasaa or tatvamimasaa ke ek kendriya vishay ke rup main ubhara tha
 Gottfried Leibniz, the German philosopher-mathematician and Isaac Newton, the English physicist-mathematician, had in their hearts two opposing theories regarding space
 ek aisi ikai ke bajaay jo swatantra rup se anya vishaywastu ke upar maujuud he, lebanese ne kaha ki antariksh vishwa main vastuon ke bich sambandhon ke sthanik sangrah se adhik kuch bhi nahin he: "antariksh ek aisa sthaan he jo ki ek saath ikatthe kiye gaye sthanon kaa parinaam he"
 anadhikrut sthaan wo sthaan he jinamein vastuon ko rakhaa ja saktaa hai or is tarah anya kshetron ke saath sthanik sambandh ho sakate hai
 For Leibniz, then space was the ideal dematerialization of relations between particular objects or possible places and therefore cannot be continuous, but must be discrete
 antariksh ko parivaar ke sadasyon ke bich sambandhon ke samaan sochaa ja saktaa he
 Even though the family members are related to each other, the existence of relationships depends on the people
 lebanese kaa tark he ki antariksh kaa vishwa main vastuon ke bina koi astitv nahin ho saktaa kyonki arth hoga ki prayek brahmad main saamagree vishwa ke sthaan ko chhodkar do bilkul ek jaise brahmadon ke madhya antar ho jayega
 lekin chunki in brahmadon ko alag kehane kaa koi awalokit tarika nahin hoga isliye abodhgamy pahchaan ke anusaar un donon ke bich koi vaastavik antar hoga
 According to the principle of sufficient reason, any theory of space that implicates that these two can be universes must be false
 prayog or prekshan par apni sthiti ke aadhaar par newton ne antariksh ko padaartheey vastuon ke bich sambandh se kahin adhik samajha
 ek rileshnist ke liye aisi jadtviya gati ke bich koi vaastavik antar nahin ho saktaa he jahaan vastu nirantar veg or gaiyr-jadtviya gati ke saath chalati he, jisamen veg samay ke saath parivartit hota he kyonki sthanik maap anya vastuon or unki gati se paraspar sambandhit he
 But Newton argued that since non-inertial motion produces strength, it must be perfected
 usne apane tark ko pramanit karne ke liye ek katai baaltee main pani ke udhaaharan kaa upyog kiya he
 a bucket hangs with a rope in water and set to spin, it starts with a flat surface
 thodi der ke baad, jaise jaise baaltee spin karti rahati he, pani kii sataha avatal ho jaati he
 If the spinning of the bucket is stopped, the surface of the water remains concave as it keeps spinning
 isliye avatal sataha pani or baaltee ke bich saapeksh gati kaa jahiraa taur par parinaam nahin he
 Instead Newton argued that this should be a consequence of non-inertial motion interrelated with space
 kai sadiyon ke liye baaltee tark is maamle main nirnaayak tha ki antariksh kaa astitv vishaywastu se swatantra hona chahie
 In the eighteenth century the German philosopher Immanuel Kant developed a theory of knowledge in which knowledge about space can be both primary and synthetic
 kant ke anusaar, antariksh ke bare main gyaan synthetic hota he, isamen antariksh ke bare main kahe gaye kathan, kathan main shabdon ke arth ke aadhaar par sahi nahin hote hai
 In his work, Kant rejected the opinion that space should be either a substance or a relation
 iske bajaay usne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki antariksh or samay maanav dwaara vishwa kii vishayashrith visheshtaayen kii tarah viksit nahin kiye gaye the varan hamaare anubhavo ko vyavasthit karne ke liye ek aprihaary suniyojit sanrachana kaa ek hissaa hai
 Elements of Euclid contain five indisputable elements that form the basis of Euclidean geometry
 inamen se ek, samanaantar nirvivaad tatv kai sadiyon tak ganitagyon ke bich bahes kaa vishay rahaa he
 This determines that a plane that has a straight line L1 and a point p that is not on L1 has only one straight line L2 on a plane that passes through point p and is parallel to the straight line L1
 19veen shatabdi tak, kuch logo ko nirvivaad tatv kii sachai par shaq tha, iske bajaae bahes is baat par kendrit thi ki kya yah ek sookhti kii tarah aavashyak he, yaa kya yah ek siddhant he jo anya sukhtiyo se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 However around 1830, the Hungarian Janos Bolaiy and the Russian Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky published separate treatises on a type of geometry that did not include parallel undisturbed elements, called hyperbolic geometry
 is jyamiti main, anant samanaantar line hoti he jo p bindu se hokar guzarati he
 As a result, the sum of angles in a triangle is less than 180o and the ratio of the circumference of the circle and its diameter is greater than pi
 1850s main, barnhard rimann ne dirghavrittakar jyamiti kaa ek samakaksh siddhant viksit kiya he, jisamen aisi koi samanaantar line nahin he jo p se hokar guzarati he
 In this geometry, the triangle is greater than 180o and the ratio of circumference and diameter in the circle is less than pi
 yadhyapi us samay vahaan ek kantiyan aam sahmati prachlit thi, jab gaiyr euclidian jyamiti ko aupchaarik rup diya gaya, to kuch logo ko aashcharya hone laga ki bhautik antariksh ghumaavdaar he yaa nahin he
 Karl Friedrich Gauss, German mathematician, was the first to consider an empirical investigation of the geometric structure of space
 unhone vishaal taarakeey trikon ke konon ke yoga kaa pareekshan karne ke bare main sochaa tathaa aisi report hai jo yah siddh karti he ki vastav main unhone germany main pahaad main sabase upar trikonmiti kii sahaayta se naapakar ek chote paimaane par yah pareekshan kiya he
 Henri Poincaré, a 19th-century French mathematician and physicist, presented an important insight that seeks to demonstrate the futility of any endeavor by discovering an experiment that applies geometry to space
 unhone aisi avasthaa par vichaar kiya jo vaigyaniko ke saamne tab aegi agar ve vishisht gunon vaale ek kaalpanik bade kshetra kii sataha, jise kshetra-vishwa kehete he, par simit ho jate hai
 In this world, the temperature varies in such a way that all things grow and shrink in the same proportion in different places in the region
 taapmaana upyukt giravat ke saath, agar vaigyanik trikon ke konon kaa yoga nirdhaarit karne ke liye maapak rads kaa upyog karne kii koshish karte hai, to ve dhokhe se ye soch sakate hai ki ve golakaar sataha ke bajaay samtal sataha main hai
 In fact, scientists cannot in principle determine whether they are on a flat or spherical space, and Poincaré says that the same is true for the debate as to whether the real space is Euclidean or not
 unke liye yah samjhaute kii baat thi ki koun si jyamiti antariksh kaa varnan karne ke liye upyog hoti thi
 Since Euclidean geometry is simpler than non-euclidean geometry, they anticipated that the former would be used to describe the correct geometry of the world
 1905 main, albert oinstin ne saapekshata ke siddhant par ek vishesh lekh prakashit kiya, jisamen unhone prastaav diya ki antariksh or samay ko ekal rup spestime main sanyukt kar dena chahie
 In this theory, the speed of light in the vacuum is the same for all observers - the result is that two events that seem synchronized to one particular observer will not appear synchronized to other observers if the observer is moving according to each other
 
 iske alaava, ek paryvekshak ek chalati ghadi kaa moolyacan karegaa jisase vah us paryvekshak kii tulana main or zyada dhire se tik kar sake jo uske anusaar sthir he, tathaa vastu us disha main chota karne ke liye maapi jaati he jis disha main ve paryvekshak ke anusaar bad rahe hai
 For ten years Einstein worked on the general theory of relativity which is a theory that describes how spacetime gravity affects each other
 gurutv ko spestime main kriyasheel kshetra bal ke rup main dekhne ke bajaay, oinstin ne suzav diya ki vah khud spestime kii jyamitiya sanrachana ko parivartit karti he
 According to the general theory, time moves slowly at those places whose gravity capacity is low and the rays of light turn in a new direction in the presence of gravitational field
 vaigyanikon ne binary pulsers ke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan kiya he or oinstin ke siddhanton kii bhavishyavaaniyon kii pushti kii he or gaiyr euclidian jyamiti aamtaur par spestime kaa varnan karne ke liye upyoh hoti he
 In modern mathematics, space is defined as sets with some additional structure
 inhen aksar vibhinn prakaar ke pratilipiyon ke rup main varnit karte he jo aise antariksh he jo euclidian antariksh ke liye sthaneey anumaanit he tathaa jahaan visheshtaye bade paimaane par aise binduo ke sthaayee sambandh ke rup main paribhaashit hoti he jo pratilipi par he
 However, there are many different mathematical objects called space
 udhaaharan ke liye, saamaanya rup main facshan antariksh kaa euclidian antariksh se koi kareebi rishta nahin he
 Space is one of the few fundamental parts of physics, which means that it cannot be defined through other parts because at present there is no more fundamental fact about it
 duusari ore yah anya moulik bhaag se sambandhit ho saktaa he
 Thus, like other fundamental parts, space can be detected through experimentation and measurement
 khagol vigyaan aisa vigyaan he jo bahari antariksh main vastuon ke avlokan, vivaran or maapne se sambandhit he
 Before working on Einstein's relativity physics, time and space are thought of as free dimensions
 oinstin kii khojon se pataa chalata he ki saapekshata kii gati hamaare antariksh or samay ko ganitiya rup se ek vastu- spestime main sanyukt kar sakati he
 This suggests that the distances in space or time are not invariant according to Lorentz coordinate transformations but rather Minkowski spacetime with spacetime intervals - which is appropriate by name
 iske alaava, samay or antariksh aayam ko bilkul minkovsky spestime ke samaan rup main nahin dekhnaa chahie
 You can roam freely in space but it cannot happen in time
 Thus, time and space coordinates are processed differently in both special relativity and general relativity
 iske alaava, oinstin ke saapekshata ke saamaanya siddhant main yah mana gaya he ki spestime jyamitiya rup se vikrut-vakrit he jo jyamitiya rup se mahatvapurn samooh ke kareeb he
 Experiments are being made to attempt to directly measure gravitational waves
 yah anivaary rup se saamaanya saapekshata kii samikarnon ke liye samaadhaan he jo spestime ke gatiman tarango kaa varnan karata he
 Indirect evidence for this has been found in the motion of the hulls-taylor binary system
 saapekshata siddhant ne brahmand sambandhi sawaal ko ujagar kiya ki brahmad kaa aakaar kya hota he or antariksh kahaan se aayaa tha
 The space appears to have been built in the Big Bang and has been expanding since then
 antariksh kaa samgr aakaar gyaat nahin he lekin iskaa vistaar bahut teji se ho rahaa he jo antarikshawya mudra sfiti ke kaaran spasht he
 Alan Guth, known for his inflation theory, presented his idea for the first time at a seminar at the Stanford Accelerator Linear Center on 23 January 1980
 bhautik antariksh kaa maap bahut samay se mahatvapurn rahaa he
 Although earlier institutions had developed the measuring system International Systems of Units, which is now the most common system of units used for measuring space and is almost universally used in science
 vartmaan main, maanak antariksh antaraal, jise maanak meter yaa bas meter kaha jaataa he, vastav main ise 1 / 299,792,458 second ke samay antaraal ke dauraan vaikum main prakaash ke dwaara tay hone vaali duuri ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 This definition, coupled with the current definition of seconds, is based on the special theory of relativity in which the speed of light plays the role of the fundamental constant of nature
 bhugol vigyaan kii vah shakha he jo prithvi ke varnan or pahchaan ke saath sambandhit he, jo sthanik jaagrukta kaa upyog yah samajhane ke liye karti he ki vasteen vishisht sthanon main kyon maujuud hai

 Geographical space is often interpreted as land and may have a connection to ownership use
 jabaki kuch samskritiya swaamitv sandarbh main vyakti ke adhikaron par jor detii he, anya samskruti bhoomi swaamitv kii sampradayik paddati ke saath pahchaan karegi, jabaki anya samskruti jaise australian adivasee, balpurvak jameen kaa swaamitv adhikaar dene ke bajaay, rishton ko vipareet kar detii he or aisa maan leti he ki vastav main ve bhoomi ke swaamitv main hai
 Spatial planning is a method of controlling the use of space at the ground level, whose decisions are taken at regional, national and international levels

 Other forms of ownership have recently been earmarked for other locations - for example the electromagnetic spectrum or the radio band of cyberspace
 saarvajanik antariksh ek aisi shabdaawalee he jise samudaay dwaara samuhik rup se adhikrut bhoomi ke kshetron ke rup main paribhaashit karne ke liye prayog karte he or yah bhoomi pratyayukta sanstha ke naam se prabandhit hoti he or is tarah ke antariksh sabhi ke liye khule hote hai
 Whereas personal property is a land that is culturally owned by a person or a company for its own use and enjoyment

 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin

 Anything else is added to the binary bases written using 0 and 1 to avoid confusion so that its basis is clear
