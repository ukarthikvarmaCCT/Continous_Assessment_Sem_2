 kautilya kaa 'arthshaastra' raajnneetik siddhanton kii ek mahatvapurn kriti he
 In this connection, the question arises why Kautilya named his book 'arthashastra'? In ancient times the term 'arthashastra' was used in a broader sense
 iske antagart multah raajnneetishastra, dharamshastra, arthshaastra, kanoon aadi kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa tha
 In the view of Acharya Kautilya, political science is an independent science and its branches are investigation, trilogy and dialogue and law
 sampoorn samaaj kii raksha raajnneeti yaa dand vyavastha se hoti he yaa rakshit praja hi apane-apane karttavya kaa paalan kar sakati he
 At that time economics was considered the scripture of politics and administration
 mahabharat main is sambandh main ek prasang he, jisamen arjuna ko arthshaastra kaa visheshgy mana gaya he
 Certainly, Kautilya's Arthashastra would also have been taken as a form of Rajashastra, as he has given many interpretations of the meaning
 kautilya ne kaha he— manuyana vrutirarthah arthath manushyon kii jeevika ko 'arth' kehete hai
 Explaining the Arthashastra, he has said - Tasya Prithivya Gnanapalanopaya: Shastra marth-shastramiti
 is prakaar yah bhi spasht he ki 'arthshaastra' ke antargat rajvyavastha or arthvyavastha donon se sambandhit siddhanton kaa samavesh he
 In fact, it would not be appropriate to call Kautilya 'arthashastra' only a scripture of polity and economy
 vastav main, yah arthvyavastha, rajvyastha, vidhi vyavastha, samaaj vyavastha or dharm vyavastha se sambandhit shaastra he
 Many other Arthasastras were composed before Kautilya's 'arthashastra', although his manuscripts are not available
 bharat main pracheen kaal se hi arth, kaam or dharm ke sanyog or sammilan ke liye prayaas kiye jate rahe hai or uske liye shastron, smritiyon or puraanon main vishad charchaayen kii gayi hai
 Kautilya has also explained the meaning of 'arthashastra', measures of attainment of Artha, Kama and Dharma
 vatsyayan ke 'kamasutra' main bhi arth, dharm or kaam ke sambandh main sutron kii rachana kii gayi he
 Kautilya himself has also accepted the creation of his earlier economics
 apane 'arthshaastra' main kai sandarbhon main usne acharya brihaspati, bharadwaj, shukracharya, parashar, pishun, vishalaksh aadi aacharyon kaa ullekh kiya he
 Prior to Kautilya, the texts of many Acharyas are named as Dandaniti
 aisa prathit hota he ki kautilya ke purv shaastra dandniti kahe jate the or ve arthshaastra ke samroop hote the
 But as many scholars have admitted that both politics and economics are not identical
 you
 en
 ghoshaal ke kathananusaar arthshaastra zyada vyapak shaastra he, jabaki dandniti maatr uski shakha he
 The scriptures written after Kautilya became known as 'niti Shastra', like Kamandaka Niti'sar
 vaise kai vidwaanon ne arthshaastra ko nitishastra kii apeksha zyada vyapak mana he
 However, in the opinion of most scholars, both ethics and economics are similar and both have the same subject area
 swayan kaamandak ne nitishastra or arthshaastra ko samroop mana he
 It is clear from the above discussion that scriptures like 'arthashastra' were composed before and after Kautilya's 'arthashastra'
 is sambandh main aise vidwaanon kii acchhee-khaasi sankhya he jo yah maanate hai ki kautilya 'arthshaastra' kaa rachanaakaar nahin tha
 The number of Western scholars is more among such scholars
 sten, jolly, winternij va kith is prakaar ke vichaar ke pratipadak hai
 Indian scholar R
 G
 Bhandarkar has also supported this
 bhandarkar ne kaha he ki patanjali ne mahabhashya main kautilya kaa ullekh nahin kiya he
 Those who did not recognize Kautilya as the author of 'arthashastra', have presented the following arguments in support of their view- pustak kii samaapti par spasht rup se likhaa gaya he- It has also been written: vishnu puraana main is ghatana kii charchaa is tarah kii gai he: Confirming the incident, Kamantak, the doer of 'nitisara', wrote: in uddharanon se spasht he ki vishnugupt or kautilya ek hi vyakti the
 In the 'arthashastra' itself, at the end of the tenth chapter of the second tribunal, the name of the author of the book is named 'kautilya': pustak ke armbh main ‘kautilyon kruthan shastram’ tathaa prayek adhyay ke ant main ‘iti kautilierthshastre’ likhakar granthkaar ne apane ‘kautilya naam ko adhik vikhyath kiya he
 Wherever the opinion of other Acharyas has been expressed, in the end there is 'iti Kautilya' i
e
 Kautilya's opinion - saying thus has shown more favor to the name Kautilya
 parantu yah sarvatha nirvivaad he ki vishnugupt tathaa kautilya abhinn vyakti the
 If the later Dandi poet called it Acharya Vishnugupta, Banabhatta called it Kautilya
 donon kaa kathan he ki is acharya ne ‘dandniti’ athwa ‘arthshaastra’ kii rachana kii
 In the Panchatantra, the name of this Acharya has been given as Chanakya, the author of economics
 kavi vishakhdutt-pranit suprasiddh naatak ‘mudrarakshas’ main chanakya ko kabhi kautilya tathaa kabhi vishnugupt naam se sambodhit kiya gaya he
 'arthashastra' was created for the first Mauryan emperor Chandragupta as a 'rule of law'
 at: isaki rachana kaa kaal vahi maananaa uchit he, jo samraat chandragupta kaa kaal he
 Archaeological scholars dated this period to 321 BC
 From 296 BC Till sure
 kai anya vidwaan samraat cendrakotus ke aadhaar par nishchit kii hui is tithi ko sweekaar nahin karte
 Sukhya Moolam Dharma: dharmasy mulan arthh
 Meaning states
 rajyasy mulan indriya jayah
 Indriyajasya Moolam Vinayah
 vinayasy mulan vridhopaseva
sukh kaa mul he, dharm
 Meaning of religion is Artha
 arth kaa mul he, rajya
 The root of the kingdom is victory over the senses
 indriyajay kaa mul he, vinay
 The core of Vinay is service to the aged
 jaise upar kaha gaya he, iskaa mukhya vishay shashan-vidhi athwa shashan-vigyaan he: ‘‘kautilyon narendrarthey shashansy vidhi: krit:
 "it is clear from these words that Acharya composed it as a method of political science and especially governance
 arthshaastra kii vishay-suchi ko dekhne se yah sarvatha pramanit ho jaataa he ki ise aajkal kahe jane vaale arthshaastra kii pustak kahana bhul he
 At the beginning of the first tribunal itself, Acharya himself has informed it by the name 'dandaniti'
 shukracharya ne dandniti ko itani mahatvapurn vidya batalaaya he ki isamen anya sab vidyaon kaa antarbhaav maan liya he- kyonki 'shastren rakshite deshe shastrachintaa pravartate' kii ukti ke anusaar shastr dwaara sushasit tathaa surakshit desh main hi veda aadi anya shastron kii chintaa yaa anushilan ho saktaa he
 Therefore, it is necessary to accept penalism as the basic discipline of all other disciplines, and the same punishment is economics
 jise aajkal arthshaastra kaha jaataa he, uske liye 'vaarta' shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he, yadhyapi yah shabd purnataya arthshaastra kaa dyotak nahin
 Kautilya has said three parts of the dialogue - agriculture, commerce and animal husbandry, from which often the profession or livelihood was earned
 manu, yajyavlky aadi shaastrakaron ne bhi in teen angon vaale vaartashastra ko sweekaar kiya he
 Shukracharya has also included Kusid in this dialogue as a means of instinct
 parantu arthshaastra ko sabhi shaastrakaron ne dandniti, raajnneeti athwa shashanvigyaan ke rup main hi varnit kiya he
 Therefore, it would be better to consider 'kautilya Arthashastra' as a book of politics and not a book of wealth
 vaise isamen kahin-kahin sampattishastra ke dhanotpaadan, dhanopbhog tathaa dhan-vinimay, dhan-vibhaajan aadi vishyon kii bhi praasangik charchaa kii gai he
 The opening verse of the first tribunal of 'kautilya Arthashastra' is going to throw more light in this regard: arthath-pracheen aacharyon ne prithvi jeetne or paalan ke upaay batalaane vaale jitne arthshaastra likhe hai, praayah un sabakaa saar lekar is ek arthshaastra kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 Where this quote explains the subject of economics, it also illuminates the truth that before the 'kautilya Arthashastra', many masters composed the Arthashastra, which was intended to propose measures for conquering the earth and its observance
 un aacharyon tathaa unke sampradaayon ke kuch naamon kaa nirdesan ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ main kiya gaya he, yadhyapi unki kritiyaan aaj uplabdh bhi nahin hotin
 This name is the following: arthshaastra ke in das sampradaayon ke aacharyon main praaia: sabhi ke sambandh main kuch-na-kuch gyaat he, parantu vishalaksh ke bare main bahut kam parichay praapt hota he
 It is very clear from these names that many great thinkers and philosophers got attention towards economics ethics and a bright literature was produced on this subject
 aaj vah sahitya lupt ho chukaa he
 Due to many foreign invasions and state revolutions, this literature has remained nameless, but whatever literature is residual indicates a wide economical tradition
 is arthshaastra main ek aisi shashan-paddati kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he jisamen raja yaa shaasha praja kaa kalyaan sampaadan karne ke liye shashan karata he
 The king cannot rule arbitrarily
 use mantriparishad kii sahaayta praapt karke hi praja par shashan karnaa hota he
 The state-priest is like a curse on the king, who can control the king if he is disinherited from the religious path and can force him to perform his duty
 sarvalokahitkaari raashtra kaa jo swaroop kautilya ko abhipret he, vah ‘arthshaastra’ ke nimnlikhit vachan se spasht he- That is, the happiness of the king is in the happiness of the people, it is in the interest of the people
 raja kaa apana priy kuch nahin he, praja kaa priy hi uskaa priy he
 Around 400 CE, Kamandaka wrote an Arthashastra based on Kautilya's Arthashastra, a poetic form divided into 20 cantos called Kamandikeya Nitisara
 yah naitikta or videsh-niti ke siddhanton par bhi vichaar karata he
 The ethics of Somdev Suri, the short economics of Hemachandra, the Yuktikalpataru of Bhoja, the Venus of Venus, etc
 are some other well-known economics, which can also be counted under texts explaining the practical side of ethics

9281 The word asplenia describes the condition when not doing tilikam

 yah garib deshon main zyada mahatvapurn he, jahaan asplania kii rogiyon ke liye rakshaatmak suvidhaae nahin hai
 However, it is advisable to have the vaccination ceremony done before the operation - until the spleen resumes its work once again

 And one result after splenectomy is that the patient may also have a massive infection, which can be fatal within a few hours

 In these patients, the risk increases more than 350 times

 It is ideal that vaccination be planned before splenectomy surgery

 gaiyr sanyugmit meningitis e or si tike, jo is prayojan ke istemaal kiya jaataa he, aamtaur par keval 3 saal kaa kawarej detaa he
 And this non-adjuvant vaccine gives less coverage than meningitis C
 un vyakti jin main kaaryaatmak tilli nahin he, malaria se ucch jokhim main rahete hai, or is beemaari se zyada prabhavit hote hai
 Traveling in malaria-prone areas is a greater risk to these individuals
 or aise yatra ko parhez rakhana hi sabase ucchit he
 Travelers should, first of all, take anti-malarial prophylaxis medication
 or machhar ke kaatane se saavdhaan rahanaa chahie

 According to Jain philosophy, this relationship of creatures and deeds is from time immemorial
 jab jeev in karmo ko apni aatma se sampoorn rup se mukt kar detaa he to vah swayan bhagwaan ban jaataa he
 But for this, he has to make proper effort
 yah jain dharm kii moulik manyata he

 In essence, their principles are as follows: dravya vah he, jisamen gun or paryaay ho-'gunaparyayavad dravyam'
 Religion is virtue and synonymous with religion
 in dharmon ke do bhed hai- bhavatmak abhavatmak
 The existence of matter is not possible without Swarupadharma
 yah jagat dravyon se bana he
 Matter is true; Because it has all the three characteristics of power, origin and expenditure
 dravya ke do rup hai- astikaay or anastikaay
 Since the abstraction of the infidel, it only counts the time, while in Astikaya there are two types of matter - Jiva and Ajiva
 chetan dravya jeev athwa aatma he
 This spirit is called Jiva in worldly condition
 jeev main praan tathaa shaareerik, maansik or andrik shakti he, jisamen kaary ke prabhaav se aupshamik, kshayik, kshaiopashmik, audayik tathaa parimanik- ye paanch bhav praan se sanyukt, rahete hai

 is prakaar pudgal yukt jeev hi sansari kaha jaataa he

 ye ichha, dwesh or bhram se prerit man, sharir or vaak kii kriyaaon tathaa vaasanaon se paidaa hote hai
 There are mainly two distinctions of karma - inamen se ghaateey karm ke chaar bhed hai- Similarly, there are four distinctions of non-fatal karma- ye hi aath tarah ke karm bandhan kaa kaaran hai
 The root cause of the bonding of an organism is contaminated emotions
 kashayon ke kaaran jeev ke pudgal se akraant ho jane ko bandh tatva kaha gaya he
 Before entering the puddles of the organism, 'bhavasrava' is born, which destroys the real nature of the organism and gets trapped in the bondage
 jeev kaa pudgal se mukt ho janaa hi ‘moksh’ he
 This moksha is of two types - bhavamoksha and drayamoksha
 bhavamoksh hi jeevamukti he
 This is the stage before actual salvation
 isamen chaaron ghaateey karmo kaa naash ho jaataa he
 Only after this the destruction of non-violent karmas, the material salvation is also attained
 jainiyon ke anusaar moksh praapt karne ke liye baarah anuprekshaon se yukt rahanaa aavashyak he, jo is prakaar hai- anitya, asharan, sansar, ekatv, anyatv, ashuchi, asrav, sanvar, nirjara, lok, bodhidurlabhtv tathaa dharmanupreksha

e
 'saptabhanginay'
 iske anusaar hamaara gyaan purna satya nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Knowledge is always relative truth jain darshan main kaa sookshm vivechan hua he
 One of the main reasons for this is that it has been modeled by the omniscient-omniscient, monogamous, mere-minded, infinitely compassionate Jineshwar Bhagavants
 jinke bataaye hue maarg par chal kar prayek aatma apana kalyaan kar sakati he
 The reason for its happiness and sorrow is the organism itself, no one else can make it unhappy
 One believes in reincarnation, previous birth, bondage-salvation etc
 ahimsa, satya, tap ye is dharm kaa mul he
 The seven elements are described in Jain texts
 yah hai- Jain philosophy does not accept this world as created by God, but believes it to be eternal

 There has, however, continued to be disagreement about the proper place for qualitative versus quantitative research
 1980 or 1990 dashak ke ant main maatraatmak paksh kii ore se aalochanaon kii baadh ke baad, data vishleshan kii vishwasaneeyata or anishchit vidhiyon ke sambandh main pariklpit samasyaon se nibatane ke liye gunatmak anusandhan kii nai paddatiyaan viksit huin
 isi dashak ke dauraan, paaramparik media vigyaapan kharch main ek mandi rahi, jisaki vajah se vigyaapan se sambandhit anusandhan ko adhik prabhavi banane main ruchi bad gai
 In the last thirty years the acceptance of qualitative research by magazine publishers and editors has begun to grow
 isse pehle kai mukhyadhara kii patrikaon kaa jhukaav prakritik vigyaan aadhaarit tathaa maatraatmak vishleshan vaale shodh lekhon kii ore tha
 First, cases can be purposefully selected on the basis of whether they are according to certain characteristics or relevant locations
 duusare, shodhakarta kii bhoomika yaa sthiti par adhik gambhirtha se dhyaan diya jaataa he
 This is because in qualitative research the possibility of the researcher adopting a 'neutral' or metaphysical position has been considered more problematic in practice and / or philosophically
 isliye gunatmak shodhakartaaon se aksar anusandhan kii prakriya main apni bhoomika par vichaar karne or apane vishleshan main ise spasht karne ko protsaahit kiya jaataa he
 Third, while qualitative data analysis can assume a wide variety of forms, it diverges from quantitative research to a focus on language, sign and meaning, as well as holistic and contextual analytical approaches rather than overuse and isolation
 phir bhi, vishleshan ke vyavasthit or paardarshee drushtikon ko lagbhag hameshaa hi yathatathyata ke liye aavashyak mana jaataa he
 For example, many qualitative methods require researchers to carefully code data and consider and document topics in a consistent and reliable manner
 sambhawatah saamaajik vigyaan main prayukt gunatmak or maatraatmak anusandhan kaa adhik paaramparik bhed, paryvekshan uddeshy ke liye yaa uljhan main daalane vaale maatraatmak parinaamon kii vyakhya ke liye gunatmak tareeqon ke istemaal main he, jabaki maatraatmak paddatiyon kaa upyog pariklpanaaon ke pareekshan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The reason for this is the establishment of the validity of the material - whether they measure the values that the researcher thinks they are measuring? - seen as one of the strengths of qualitative research
 jabaki maatraatmak paddatiyon ko sankendrit pariklpanaaon, maap upkarnon or praayogic ganit ke madhyam se adhik nirupak, vishwasaneey or sateek maap pradaan karne vaale ke rup main dekha gaya he
 In contrast, qualitative data is generally difficult to display in graphs or mathematical contexts
 gunatmak anusandhan kaa upyog aksar niti or kaarykram moolyankan anusandhan ke liye kiya jaataa he kyonki vah maatraatmak drushtikon kii tulana main katipay mahatvapurn prashnon kaa adhik kushalta or prabhavi dhang se uttar de sakati he
 It is specifically intended to understand how and why certain outcomes have been achieved but also to answer important questions about relevance, unintended effects, and the impact of programs, such as: were expectations reasonable? Did the processes work as expected? Were key components capable of fulfilling their duties? Was there any undesired effect of the program? The qualitative approach features the ability to adapt to new developments or issues during the research process, in addition to allowing for more variety of responses
 jahaan gunatmak anusandhan mahangaa or sanchaalan main zyaada samay le saktaa he, kai kshetra aise gunatmak takneekon ko lagu karte hai, jo adhik sargarbhit, kifaayati or samayik parinaam dene ke liye vishesh rup se viksit kiye gaye hon
 in anukoolnon kaa ek aupchaarik udhaaharan he twarit gramin moolyankan, par aise or bhi kai maujuud hai
 Qualitative researchers can adopt many different approaches to data collection, such as basic theory practice, narrative, storytelling, classical ethnography, or reflection
 Qualitative methods are also loosely present in other systematic approaches such as work-research or worker-network theory
 sangrahit data praaroop main saakshaatkaar or samuhik charchaaen, prekshan or pratibimbit field nots, vibhinn paath, chitra or anya saamagree shaamil kar sakate hai
 Often classifies data as the primary basis in a pattern to organize and report qualitative research results
 gunatmak shodhakarta aam taur par soochna ekatrit karne ke liye nimna paddatiyon kaa sahaara lete hai: sahabhaagi prekshan, gaiyr sahabhaagi prekshan, field nots, pratikriyaatmak patrikaayen, sanrachit saakshaatkaar, arddh sanrachit saakshaatkaar, asanrachit saakshaatkaar or dastavejon va samagriyon kaa vishleshan
 Methods of interaction and observation may vary widely from setting to setting
 sahabhaagi prekshan pratikriyaatmak sikh kii ranneeti he, na ki prekshan kii ekal paddati
 sahabhaagi prekshan main shodhakarta aam taur par ek samskruti, samooh, yaa setting ke sadsy banate hai or us setting ke anuroop bhoomika apanaate hai
 The purpose of doing this is to provide the researcher with the benefit of a closer insight into the culture's practices, purpose and feelings
 yah tark diya jaataa he ki samskruti ke anubhavon ko samajhane ke prati shodhakartaaon kii kshamta main avrodh utpann ho saktaa he agar ve bina bhaag liye nirikshan karte hai
 Some specific qualitative methods are the use of focus groups and key indicator interviews
 Focus group technique involves a moderator who organizes a short discussion between selected individuals on a specific topic
 yah bazaar anusandhan or prayokta / kaaryakartaaon ke saath nai pahal ke pareekshan kii vishesh rup se lokapriy vidhi he
 a traditional and specialized form of qualitative research is called cognitive testing or experimental testing which is used to develop quantitative survey items
 surveykshan madon kaa adhyayan pratibhaagiyon par prayog kiya jaataa he taaki madon kii vishwasaneeyata or vaidhata kii jaanch kii ja sake
 a frequently used qualitative research approach in educational social sciences includes the following: gunatmak data kaa sarv saamaanya vishleshan paryvekshak prabhaav he
 That is, experts or audience observers examine the data, make an assumption and understand it, and report their impact in a structural and sometimes quantitative form
 koding is arth main ek vyaakhyaatmak takanic he ki donon data ko suvyavasthit karte hai or kuch maatraatmak paddatiyon main un nirvachanon ko pravartit karne ke liye saadhan uplabdh karaate hai
 Most coding requires the analyst to read the data and delimit its segments
 prayek khand par ek "code" kaa label laga hota he - aam taur par ek shabd yaa chota vaakyansh, jo yah jataata he ki kaise sambhddha data khand anusandhan ke uddeshyon ko suchit karte hai
 When the coding is complete, the analyst generates the report through a mixture of the following: a summary of the circulation of the code, a discussion of the similarities and differences in the respective code across the various original sources / references, or of the relationship between one or more codes
 Comparison
 kuch ucch sanrachana vaale gunatmak data aam taur par saamagree ke atirikt vibhaajan ke bina hi kodit kiye jate hai
 In these cases, the code is often implemented as the upper layer of data
 in kodon ke maatraatmak vishleshan aam taur par is prakaar ke gunatmak data ke liye capstone vishleshnatmak qadam he
 Contemporary qualitative data analysis is sometimes supported by computer programs
 ye program koding ke vyaakhyaatmak swabhaav ko nahin nikaalte, balki data sangrahan / punarprapti main vishleshak kii dakshata ko badhaane or data par code lagu karne ke uddeshy ko puraa karte hai
 Many programs offer editing and modification capabilities of coding, allowing for work sharing, peer review, and recursive testing of data
 koding vidhi kii ek lagaataar hone vaali aalochana he ki yah gunatmak data ko maatraatmak data main badalane kaa prayaas karata he, jisase data kii vividhta, samruddhi or vyaktigat swabhaav samaapt ho jaataa he
 Analysts respond to this critique by reverting the richness absent from the mere list of codes, rendering the definition of their code perfectly and linking them seamlessly with the underlying data
 kuch gunatmak dataseton kaa bina koding ke vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 a common method here is recursive abstraction, where datasets are summarized and then summarized
 antim parinaam ek adhik susambaddha saar hota he jinhen aswan ke purvavarti charnon ke bina sateek rup se pahchaanana mushkil hota he
 a frequent criticism of recursive segregation is that the final conclusion is several times removed from the underlying data
 haalanki yah sach he ki karaab praarambhik saransh nishchit rup se ek trutipurna antim report utpann karenge, par gunatmak vishleshak is aalochana kaa jawaab de sakate hai
 They do this, like those using the coding method, by documenting the reasoning behind each summary step, citing examples from data where statements are included, and intermediate summaries where statements are not included
 kuch takanic gunatmak data ke vishaal seton ko scan karte hue tathaa chhaantate hue computaron ke uttolan par nirbhar karte hai
 At their most basic level, mechanical techniques rely on counting the occurrence of words, phrases, or tokens within the data
 aksar saamagree vishleshan ke rup main sanderbhit, in takneekon ke output kai unnat sankhyikeey vishleshanon ke prati uttaradaayi hote hai
 Mechanical techniques are especially more suitable for some scenarios
 ek aisa paridrishy aise vishaal dataseton ke liye he jiskaa prabhavi dhang se vishleshan maanav ke liye bas sambhav nahin, yaa unamem aaveshtit soochna ke mulya kii tulana main unka vishleshan laagat kii drushti se nishedhaatmak he
 Another scenario is when the main value of a dataset is the extent to which it holds the "red flag" or "green flag"
 yantric takanic kii ek satat aalochana maanav anuvadak kaa abhaav he
 And where the masters of these methods are able to write state-of-the-art software to mimic certain human decisions, the majority of "analysis" is without a human being
 vishleshak apane tareekon ke saapeksh mulya ko yaa to k) data ke vishleshan ke liye maanav team ko kaam par rakhane or unke prashikshan dwaara yaa kha) kisi karrwai yogya pind ko andekha chhodte hue, data ko achoota jane dete hue, pramann dwaara pratikriya jataate hai
 Contemporary qualitative research is conducted, inter alia, from several different paradigms affecting the conceptual and conceptual concerns of validity, control, data analysis, ethics and epistemology
 pichley 10 varshon main yojit shodh adhik vyaakhyaatmak, aadhunikottar or aalochanatmak vyavhaaron ke prati vishisht jhukaav liye hai
 guba or linkan samakaleen gunatmak anusandhan ke paanch pramukh nidarshanon kii pahchaan karte hai: nishchayatmak, nishchayottar, aalochanatmak siddhant, rachanaatmak or sahabhaagi / sahakaari
 guba or linkan dwaara soochibaddh prayek nidarshan, mulya-mimasaa, abhipret anusandhan karrwai, anusandhan prakriya / parinaamon kaa niyantran, satya or gyaan kii neenv ke saath sambandh, vaidhata, paath pratinidhitiv or shodhakarta / pratibhaagiyon kii awaz
 or anya nidarshanon ke saath anurupata ke swayansiddh matbhedon dwaara abhilakshith hai
 In particular, self-determination includes the extent to which exemplary concerns can be "subsequently settled toward each other in ways that enable the simultaneous practice of both"
 Definitive and postmodern paradigms share axiomatic beliefs, but are largely incompatible with critical, constructivist, and participatory paradigms
 isi tarah, aalochanatmak, rachnawadi or sahabhaagi nidarshan kuch muddon par swayansiddh hai 
 Validity is a central issue of qualitative research
 There are many different ways to establish legitimacy, including: member screening, interviewer confirmation, peer information, long-term appropriations, negative case analysis, accountingability, confirmation, equalization, and balance
 Most of these methods have been coined by Lincoln and Guba, or at least widely described
 1970 dashak ke ant tak kai pramukh patrikaon ne gunatmak shodh lekhon kaa prakaashan aarambh kar diya or kai nai patrikaayen ubharin jinhone gunatmak anusandhan paddatiyon ke bare main keval gunatmak anusandhanparak adhyayanon or lekhon ko prakashit kiya
 In the 1980s and 1990s, the focus of new qualitative research journals became diverse, focusing beyond the traditional origins of qualitative research such as anthropology, sociology, and philosophy
 nai sahasrabdi ne prati varsh kam se kam ek nai gunatmak shodh patrika ke pravartan sahit, gunatmak anusandhan ke kshetra main visheshgyata rakhane vaali patrikaon kii sankhya main naatakeey vruddhi dekhi

 Hathwa is a village in Araria district of Purnia division under Bihar state of India
 veydant gyanayog kii ek shakha he jo vyakti ko gyaan prapti kii disha main utprerit karata he
 Its main source is the Upanishads, which are considered to be the essence of Vedas and Aranyak texts
 upanishad vaidic sahitya kaa antim bhaag he, isiilie isko veydant kehete hai
 The description of rituals and worship is mainly in mantras and Brahmins, knowledge is interpreted in Upanishads
 'veydant' kaa shabdic arth he - 'vedon kaa ant' 
 The three branches of Vedanta that are most well known are: Advaita Vedanta, Specific Advaita and Dvaita
 aadi shankaracharya, ramanuj or shri madhwacharya jinako kramash: in tino shakhaon kaa pravartak mana jaataa he, inke alaava bhi gyanayog kii anya shakhaayen hai
 These branches are known as their promoters, including Bhaskar, Vallabh, Chaitanya, Nimbaraka, Vachaspati Mishra, Sureshwar and Vigyan Bhikshu
 aadhunik kaal main jo pramukh vedanti huye hai unamem ramakrishna paramhans, swami vivekanand, arvind ghosh, swami shivanand raja rammohan roy or raman maharishi ullekhneey hai
 These modern thinkers represent the Advaita Vedanta branch
 duusare vedanto ke pravartakon ne bhi apane vichaaron ko bharat main bhalibhanti prachaarit kiya he parantu bharat ke baahar unhen bahut kam janaa jaataa he
 'vedanta' literally means 'the end of the Vedas'
 armbh main upanishdon ke liye ‘veydant’ shabd kaa prayog hua kintu baad main upanishdon ke siddhanton ko aadhaar maanakar jin vichaaron kaa vikaas hua, unke liye bhi ‘veydant’ shabd kaa prayog hone laga
 Three reasons are often given for the use of the word 'vedanta' for the Upanishads: - acharya udaiveer shastri ke anusaar ‘veydant’ pad kaa taatpary he- It has been said above that the word 'vedanta' was originally used for the Upanishads
 alag-alag samhitaon tathaa unki shakhaon se sambaddh anek upanishad hamen praapt hai
 The main and ancient ones are - Ish, Cane, Kath, Mundak, Mandukya, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Chandogya and Brihadaranyaka
 in upanishdon ke darshanik siddhanton main kaaphi kuch samanta he kintu anek sthanon par virodh bhi prathit hota he
 Over time, the need was felt that unanimous teachings should be compiled by co-ordinating the ideas which seem to be opposing
 isi aavashyaktaa kii purti ke liye baadaraayan vyas ne brahmasutra kii rachana kii jise veydant sutara, sharirakasutra, sharirakamimasaa yaa uttarmimasaa bhi kaha jaataa he
 In it, the principles of the Upanishads have been compiled very briefly, in formulaic form
 atyadhik sankshep hone ke kaaran sutron main apane aap main aspashtataa he or unhen bina bhashya yaa tikaa ke samajhnaa sambhav nahin he
 That is why many commentators tried to clarify their intentions by their respective languages, but they had their own viewpoints in this explanation and that is why they differ enough
 prayek ne yah siddh karne kii cheshtaa kii ki uskaa bhashya hi brahmasutron ke vaastavik arth kaa spashtikaran karata he
 As a result, all the commentators became promoters of the Vedanta sect
 inamen pramukh he shankar kaa advaitvaad, ramanuj kaa vishishtadvaitvaad, madhv kaa dwaitvaad, nimbark kaa dwaitadvaitvaad tathaa vallabh kaa shuddhadvaitvaad
 Within these languages, there was a series of commentaries on these languages and commentaries on these languages
 apane-apane sampradaay ke mat ko pusht karne ke liye anek swatantra granthon kii bhi rachana hui, jinase veydant kaa sahitya atyant vishaal ho gaya
 Historically, for a teacher to become / understand Acharya, he has to write commentaries or commentaries on the books of Vedanta
 in pustakon main teen mahatvapurn pustak shaamil hai upanishad, bhagavad gita or brahmasutra, jinhen prasthaantrayee kehete hai
 Accordingly, Adi Shankaracharya, Ramanuja and Madhvacharya have all given specific compositions on these three important books
 teenon granthon main pragat vichaaron kaa kai tarah se vyaakhyaan kiya ja saktaa he
 For this reason, many opinions regarding Brahm, Jiva and Jagat were presented and in this way many forms of Vedanta were created
 gaudpad tathaa unke anuvarthi aadi shankaracharya brahm ko pradhan maanakar jeev or jagat ko usase abhinn maanate hai
 According to him the element should be devoid of origin and destruction
 nashvan jagat tatvashoonya he, jeev bhi jaisaa dikhaai detaa he vaisaa tatvat: nahin he
 In the awakened and self-awakening, the living organism lives in the world, but in sleep, the living entity remains in a conscious state
 isse siddh hota he ki jeev kaa shuddh rup sushupti jaisaa hona chahie
 The state of sleep is impermanent, so beyond this, Turiyavastha is considered pure form of life
 is avasthaa main nashwar jagat se koi sambandh nahin hota or jeev ko pun: nashwar jagat main pravesh bhi nahin karnaa padataa
 This Turiyavastha derives from practice
 brahm-jeev-jagat main abhed kaa gyaan utpann hone par jagat jeev main tathaa jeev brahm main leen ho jaataa he
 Despite the real imperviousness of the three, the organism considers the world separate from itself due to ignorance
 parantu swapnsansar kii tarah jaagrath sansar bhi jeev kii kalpana he
 The only difference is that the dream is the result of personal imagination, while the awakened experience - the macro - past superconception
 swapnjagat kaa gyaan hone par donon main mithyaatv siddh he
 But like the Buddhists, in Vedanta the creature is not considered false due to being part of the world
 mithyaatv kaa anubhav karanevaala jeev param satya he, use mithyaa maanane par sabhi gyaan ko mithyaa maananaa hoga
 But the form in which an organism behaves in the world is false
 jeev kii turiyavastha bhedagyaan shunya shuddhavastha he
 The relation of the knower-known-knowledge is a false relationship
 inase pare hokar jeev apni shuddh chetnavastha ko praapt hota he
 In this state there is not even a trace of difference because the distinction is in the duality
 isi advait avasthaa ko brahm kehete hai
 The element is infinite, if the second element is also there, then the limit of the first element will be limited and by being limited, that element will be intelligible in which the distinction of knowledge-knowledge-knowledge will be reflected
 anubhav sakshi he ki sabhi gyey vastuen nashwar hai

 An industry body recommends that patients wearing hard contact lenses should stop wearing them for a minimum of six weeks plus hard work contacts have been worn for the next six weeks every three years
 Before surgery, patient corneas are examined together with a pachymeter to determine their thickness and to measure their surface contour with a topographer
 Using low power lasers, a topographer creates a topographic map of the cornea
 This process also detects astigmatism and other irregularities in the shape of the cornea
 Using this information, the surgeon calculates the amount and locations of corneal tissue to be removed during operation

 Severe aberrations can cause significant vision loss
 in aberrations starbursts, ghosting, halos, dabl drushti or anya post oparative jatiltaaon ke ek number shaamil hai
 There are always concerns about LASIK because of its tendency to induce higher order aberrations
 The advancement of LASIK technology has helped reduce the risk of clinically significant visual impairment after surgery
 putali ke aakaar or aberrations ke bich ek sambandh he
 Effectively, the larger the pupil size, the greater the risk of aberrations
 is sambandh cornea ke achoota bhaag or reshaped bhaag ke bich aniyamitata kaa parinaam he

 Over time, most attention has shifted from other aberrations and centered on spherical aberration
 LASIK and PRK induce spherical aberration, because of the laser's tendency to undercorrect outward movement from the center of the treatment area
 yah mukhya rup se pramukh sudhaar ke liye ek mudda he
 Theories posit that if lasers were simply programmed to adjust for this trend, no significant spherical aberration would occur
 acchhee tarah se kuch ucch aadesh aberrations wavefront anukulit LASIK ke saath ankhon main bhavishya ho saktaa he Higher order aberrations taken during pre-op exams are measured in micrometers on the wavescan, while the beam size of the smaller lasers approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is about 1000 times larger than 0
65 mm
 Thus flaws are inherent in the process and the reason why patients experience corona, glare and starburst, even with small naturally dilated pupils in dim light
