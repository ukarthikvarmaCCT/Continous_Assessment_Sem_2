 It determined the national boundary only on the basis of the principle of power balance, but gave some importance to the popular sentiment

 She employs Sher Singh to complete this task, and asks her to marry him when he succeeds
 sher singh pratimaa lene ke liye nikal padataa he, lekin uske vahaan pahunchne se pehle hi, thakur vah pratimaa le ja chukaa hota he
 The idol displaces Thakur due to the anger of the Mother Goddess, and her son dies
 kumbh meley ke din uske parivaar ke baaki sadasyon kii bhi mrityu na ho jaae, is ashanka ke kaaran vah apane bhai, ranjit ko yah sunishchit karne ke liye kahata he ki pratimaa ko mandir main waapas rakh diya jaae, lekin ranjit aisa karne main asafal ho jaataa he, or is kaaran vah apni beti, minaa se alag ho jaataa he, or pagal ho jaataa he
 Ramlal, who holds the statue, disappears; And his wife is separated from his son, Birju, and his brother-in-law, Mangal, is arrested for the murder of Rana
 mangal ko jail main kaid kar die jaataa he
 After this, his wife moves to live with Mangal's son Shekhar in Bombay
 varshon baad, raamalaal kaa putr birju bada ho chukaa hota he or aajeevika ke liye choti murtiyon banaata he; minaa sadakon par nrity kaa karti he, or uski sahyogi uski ek gaay he; mangal ek gangster he; sher singh abhi bhi pratimaa kii talash main laga he; or ranjit abhi bhi pagal he
 Shekhar dramatically discovers the statue, and puts it under protection by issuing a press release
 parantu vah pratimaa phir chori ho jaati he, or is baar uske bare main kisi ko bhi pataa nahin hota

 These were solid silver pieces made according to the system of traditional units, and were associated with simple multiplication and division
 baat in hi ikaayiyon main se ek tha
 This system was in vogue till 1897, when the decimal system created by Jayant Monkol was introduced by Raja Ram V, with 1 point = 100 satang

 During World War II, the baht was kept on par with the Japanese yen
 1956 se 1973 tak, baat ko america dollar ke saath 20
8 baat = 1 dollar ke vinimay dar par pegs kiya gaya or 1978 tak 20 baht = 1 dollar par
 Due to the strength of the US economy, Thailand pegged it at 25 per dollar from 1984 to 2 July 1997, when the country was affected by the 1997 Asian Economic Crisis
 baat ko flot kar diya gaya or uskaa mulya aadha ho gaya, or janvari 1998 main vah 56 prati dollar ke nunatam dar par pahunch gaya

 atirikt-3 yaa 3-atirikt binary code ek aatm poorak dwiadhari kodit dashamalav code or ank pranali he
 This is a biased representation
 atirikt-3 kuch puraane computer par,saath hi cash register or haath se yojit 1970 ke dashak ke portable electronic calculator,anya upyogon ke bich main istemaal kiya gaya tha
 Biased code is a method for representing values with a balanced number of positive and negative numbers, using a pre-defined number 'n' as a partisan one
 pakshpatpurna code gaiyr bhaarit code rahe hai
 In addition-3, numbers are represented as decimal digits, and each digit plus 3 digits represents four bits as the value: the smallest binary number represents the smallest value
 sabase badi dwiadhari sankhya,sabase bada mulya kaa pratinidhitiv karata he 
 To encode a number, 127 simply encodes each decimal digit
 atirikt-3ankaganit,saamaanya gaiyr pakshpatpurna,bisidi yaa binary system sthetiya sankhya kii tulana main alag elgoridam kaa upyog karata he
 After adding two extra-3 digits, the raw sum is extra-6
 udhaaharan ke liye,1 or 2 ko jodne ke baad,yoga 3 ke bajaay 6 dikata he
 In order to overcome this problem, after adding two digits, subtracting the binary 0011 if the resulting digit is less than decimal 10 is necessary to remove the entanglement bias, subtracting binary 1101 i if an overflow has occurred
 gaiyr pakshpatpurna koding par atirikt-3 koding kaa praathmik laabh yah he ki ek dashamalav sankhya main ho saktaa he nau ' purit ke rup main aasaani ke rup main ek binary sankhya main ho saktaa he vaale purit;bas sabhi bits palatnaa
 Also, when the sum of two extra-3 digits is greater than 9, the carry bit of a 4 bit connector will be set higher
 iskaa kaaran yah kaam karata he, do ank, ek "atirikt" kaa yoga 6 main parinaam mulya jodne ke baad
 Because a 4- bit integer can only hold values up to 15, an addition of 0,6 means that any amount greater than 9 will overflow

 Through this, the design explains his thoughts in this learning to the accomplished Raj and the Mistry
 isi liye varnanaatmak jyamiti ko ejeeniyar kii sarvadeshik bhashaa kaha gaya he
 In solving the problem related to objects by descriptive geometry these things are necessary: samtal par tiryak prakshep bhi ho saktaa he; tab prakshep vastu ke vibhinn binduon se samaantar rekhaayen abhilamb disha ke atirikt kisi anya disha main khinchi jaati hai
 Oblique interpolation is used for photographing
 kaisaa bhi prakshep ho, prakshepan ke liye khinchi gai samaantar rekhaon ko prakshepak, athwa kiran, kehete hai
 The magnitude of interpolation in a projection derived from parallel rays does not depend on the distance of the projectile
 yadi sabhi prakshepak kirane ek bindu se, jise drushtibindu kehete hai, lekar jaaen, to drishylekhi prakshep, athwa sandarsh, miltaa he
 In this way, such a picture of the object is formed as it is visible to the eye
 drushtibindu or prakshep samtal donon se vastu kii duriyon par is chitra kaa pariman nirbhar karata he
 In general, perpendicular projection means vertical projection
 vastunirupan kii monj vidhi main vastu ke do, yaa kabhi-kabhi adhik, samatalon par lambrekhi prakshep liye jate hai
 The main plane is two: vertical plane, denoted by OO and horizontal, expressed by Q
 in samatalon kii prakshep rekha ko aadhaar rekha kehete hai or aa re se suchit karte hai
 Sometimes a third plane is required, then it is taken as perpendicular to a and it is perpendicular to both the planes
 urdhwadhar samtalawaale prakshep ko uu-prakshep yaa sanmukhdarshan kehete hai or kshaitij samtalawaale ko ksha-prakshep yaa anuvikshep kehete hai
 Parshadarshana, or transverse darshan, is also taken in place of the confluence, and apex, or taldarshan, or transverse deflection is also taken in place of the oblation
 or in shabdon kaa hi vyavhaar spashtataa ke liye kar diya jaataa he
 Similarly, lateral view is also called inward vision
 mukhya prakshep samatalon ko vistaar main anant mana jaataa he
 With them, the sky is divided into four parts, which are called quartiles
 drashtaa or urdhwadhar samtal ke bichwaale chutarthanshon se kshaitij samtal se uuparavaale ko pratham or nichevale ko chutarth kehete hai
 From the vertical plane to the rear quartiles, the upper one is called second and the lower one is called third
 trivimeetiya akaash main sthit kisi bindu ba ko samtal par nirupit karne ke liye ba se donon mukhya samatalon par abhilamb khinche jate hai
 Suppose they have feet on the vertical plane and on the horizontal
 ab urdhwadhar samtal ko aa re ke parit: chaturthaansh 1 se 2 kii ore ghumaakar kshaitij sthiti main le aayaa jaataa he or bau kii yah sthiti tathaa baksh kii mul sthiti samtal par bindu ba ko nirupit karti hai
 In architectural design, the object is considered to be in the first quarter
 falat: sammukhdarshan anuvikshep ke upar rahata he
 In engineering design, the body is considered to be in the third quadrant and in the perspective line it is located in the second quadrant
 chaturth chaturthaansh kaa kadachit hi vyavhaar hota he
 By the above method, the interpolation of the rujurekha will always be found
 anant samtal ko prakshep dwaara nirupit nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki uskaa prakshep donon mukhya samatalon ko dhak degaa
 Thus, the plane is represented by the intersecting lines of its and main planes, which are called traces
 yadi samtal kisi bhi mukhya samtal ke samaantar nahin he to iske anurekhan yaa to aa re ke samaantar honge, yaa aa re ko ek hi bindu par kaatenge
 The plane going from a to a is represented by the trailing lateral plane
 prishthon or unke pratichchhed vakron kaa nirupan unke vibhinn parichchhedon ke prakshepon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Developable pages are specifically represented by this method

 The shadow, the cover, the picture and the published part can be easily represented by descriptive geometry
