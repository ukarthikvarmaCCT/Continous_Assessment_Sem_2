 official website elliod yaa eliyad — pracheen unani shastreey mahakavy he, jo europe ke adikavi homer kii rachana maani jaati he
 It is named after the battle of the city of Ilion
 samgr rachana 24 pustakon main vibhakt he or isamen 15,693 panktiyaan hai
 The Iliad describes the Greek Longo's war with the kingdom of Troy
 is mahakavy main try ke vijay or dhwans kii kahani tathaa unani vir eklis ke virtv kii gaathaayen hai
 In a nutshell, the story of this epic is as follows: Paris, the son of Priam King of Ilion, abducted the supreme beauty Helen, the wife of Menelaus, King of Sparta, in the absence of her husband
 hellen ko pun: praapt karne tathaa ilian ko dand dene ke liye menelouse or uske bhai aagaamemnan ne samast greek raajaaon or saamanton kii sena ekatra karke ilian ke viruddh abhiyaan aarambh kiya
 But this poem does not have a direct description of the above mentioned cause and its end result, ie the destruction of the Ilion
 iskaa aarambh to greek shivi main kavy ke nayak ekiles ke rosh se hota he
 Agamemnon has rapefully kept the daughter of the priest of Suryadev Apollo
 parinamat: greek shivi main mahamari faili hui he
 The prophet Kalkus stated that the epidemic would not stop until the daughter of the priest was returned
 agamemnan badi kathinaayee se iske liye prastut hota he par iske saath hi vah badale main ekilies ke paas se ek duusari beti briseis ko chin letaa he
 Angry and angry at this insult, vows not to fight in the war
 vah apni mirmidan sena or apane mitra patroklas ke saath apane deron main chalaa jaataa he or kisi bhi manuhaar ko nahin sunata
 As a result, Agamemnon's side in the war begins to grumble
 greek sena bhagkar apane shivi main sharan leti he
 Constrained by the circumstances, Agamemnon sends his messengers to the Achilles and agrees to do much to alleviate his fury
 parantu ekilies kaa rosh dur nahin hota or vah duusare din apane ghar laut jane kii ghoshnaa karata he
 But in fact he stays to see the plight of Agamemnon's army
 kintu uskaa mitra patroklas apane paksh kii is durdasha ko dekhakar ko dekhakar khiz uthta he or vah ekilies se yuddh main ladane kii ajna praapt kar letaa he
 The Achilles also give him his armor and send his Miramidan soldiers to battle with him
 patroklas ilian kii sena ko khaded detaa he par swayan ant main vah ilian ke maharathi hektar dwaara maar daalaa jaataa he
 Hearing the news of the death of Patroclus, Echilles is mad with grief and anger and after entering into a new armor with Agamemnon, enters the battlefield to avenge his friend from Hektor
 ekilies se yuddh aarambh karte hi pasa palat jaataa he
 He kills Hektor and drags his body into the battlefield by tying his leg to the back of his chariot, causing his head to roll in the gully
 iske pashchaat patroklas kii antyeshti bade thaat baat ke saath kii jaati he
 Echilius brings Hektar's body to his camp and decides to dissect his body and feed it to the dogs
 hektar kaa pita ilian raja prium uske shivi main apane putr kaa shav praapt karne ke liye upasthit hota he
 His mourning reminds Achilles of his father and his anger goes away, and he, overwhelmed by compassion, gives the body of Hektar to his father and at the same time the war is halted for 12 days
 hektar kii antyeshti ke saath eliyad kii samaapti ho jaati he
 In some handwritten copies, a line at the end of Iliad suggests that after the funeral of Hektar, a woman named Amazon came to the aid of Pantheilia Priam, queen of warriors
 isi sanket ke aadhaar par smarna ke quintus naamak kavi ne 14 pustakon main eliyad kaa poorak kavy likhaa tha
 In modern times, Shri Arvind Ghosh also in the evening of his life had started the creation of Iliyad in English in a mere circle, which could not be completed
 navam pustak kii rachana ke madhya main hi unki chirsmadhi kii uplabdhi ho gai
 The era whose events are mentioned in Iliyad is called Veerayuga
 shliman or defelt ko try nagar kii khudaai ke pashchaat is yug kii satyata nirvivaad siddh ho chuki thi
 BC The 13th and 13th centuries are considered the era of this era

 Problems related to Homer's compositions are extremely complex
 ek samay homer ke astitv tak par andeh kiya jane laga tha
 But now the situation has become more favorable, although Homer's epics are still considered the culmination of a development in which the skill of a extraterrestrial genius is clearly targeted
 eliyad main mahakavy kii drushti se saralata or kavikarm kaa abhootpurv saamanjasy he
 From the point of view of policy, the performance of extraordinary work and the devastating result of anger, as it happened in this poem, will be difficult to find elsewhere
 iske purush paatro main agamemnan, ekilies, patroklas, menelouse, prium, paris or hektar ullekhneey hai
 Helen, Hecuba, Andromaco, etc
 are great among the female characters
 yuddh main manushya or devtaa sabhi bhaag lete hai, kahin manushya gunon main devataaon se unche uth jate hai to kahin devtaa log maanviya durbalataaon ke shikaar hote drushtigochar hote hai evam parihaas ke paatr banate hai
 a number of Iliad corresponds with the Indian epics, including Helen's abduction and Ilean's combustion having a clear resemblance to sita-haran and Lanka
 sambhavat: isi kaaran megasthaneez ko bharat main homer ke mahakavyon ke astitv kaa bhram hua tha
 Homer's translations are numerous, but his translation, as in every high-quality translation of the original work, is a problem
 yadi anuvadak saralata par drushti rakhata he to homer ke kavitv ko ganvaa baithta he or kavitv ko pakadana chahta he to saralata kafoor ho jaati he
 This epic has been translated into every language of Europe
 padya or gadhy donon main anek anuwaad hue hai
 There have also been translations of both 'iliad' and 'odyssey' in many Indian languages

 Antibodies, also known as Ig) in short, are gamma hemoglobin proteins, which are found in the blood or other body fluids of vertebrates, and are used by the immune system to identify foreign substances such as bacteria and viruses and They are used to neutralize
 ye aam taur par paanch sanrachanaatmak icaayiyon se mil kar bane hai-jiname se prayek kii do badi va baari shrinkhlaayein tathaa do choti va halki shrinkhlaayein hoti hai-jo ek saath mil kar, udhaaharan ke liye, ek ikai ke saath monomers, do ikaiyon ke saath dimers or paanch ikaiyon ke saath mil kar pentamors banaati hai
 Antibodies are made up of a type of white blood cell called a plaque cell
 pratipind baari shrinkhlaayein tathaa pratipind bhi kai vibhinn prakaar ke hai, jo samuhik rup se alag-alag prakaar ke isotip banaate hai, jo unki baari shrinkhalaa par aadhaarit hote hai
 Five different types of antibodies are known in mammals, which perform different functions, and they help to identify the appropriate immune response to fight different types of foreign matter
 haalanki sabhi pratipindon kii saamaanya sanrachana bahut samaan hoti he, protein kii nok par chota sa kshetra atyant parivartansheel he, jo thodi alag tip sanrachanaon vaale lakhon pratipindon yaa pratijan ko astitv main bane rahane kii anumati detaa he
 This region is known as the highly variable region
 inamen se prayek prakaar anya lakshya ke saath jud saktaa he jise pratijan kehete hai
 This large diversity in antibodies helps the immune system recognize the types of antigens with equally large diversity
 pratipind dwaara pahachaanaa gaya pratijan kaa vishisht bhaag epitope kehalaata he
 These epitopes are joined to their antibody by a highly specialized process called inducing fit, which allows the antibody to recognize and associate only its specific antigen among the millions of different molecules responsible for anatomy
 pratipind dwaara ek pratijan kii pahchaan ise pratiraksha ) pranali ke anya bhaagon dwaara hamale ke liye chihnit karti he
 Antibodies can also neutralize targets directly, for example, by associating with part of the pathogen that can cause infection
 pratipind kii badi or vividh jansankhya jin khandon ke kramarahit sanyojanon se banati he jo vibhinn pratijan ko jodne vaali citon ) ko kutabaddh karti he, jiske baad pratipind jin ke is kshetra main kramarahit sthiti parivartan hote hai, jo vividhta ko or adhik badhaate hai
 Antibody genes also reconstitute themselves through the class transformation process, converting the base of the heavy chain to another, creating a different type of isotype of the antibody that maintains the antigen-specific transformation region
 yah ekal pratipind ko pratiraksha pranali ke kai alag alag bhaagon dwaara istemaal kiye jane kii anumati detaa he
 The production of antibodies is the main function of the physical immune system
 sarphase immunoglobulin apane transmembren kshetra dwaara prabhaav daalane vaali bi koshikaon kii jhilli se judaa he, jabaki pratipind aiji / Ig kaa sravi prakaar he or isamen trans membren kshetra kii kami hoti he, isliye pratipind raktadhara or sharir ke mulaayam hisson main sravit kiye ja sakate hai
 As a result, the surface Ig and Ig are identical except for the transmembrane regions
 isliye, ve pratipind ke do prakaaron ke rup main jane jate hai: ghulansheel prakaar yaa membren bound prakaar 
 The membrane bound type of a antibody can be called Akk॓॓ःःक्कीक्की xxwrep 2 ब् क्ष / / / / / ब् / / / / / / / / ब् / / / 2ब्ग्ग् xxwrep 10 2 xxwrep 26 ब् ोग ब्ब्स ब् इम इम इमो xxwrep 2 गो ग xxwrep 5 या या yah bi koshika receptor ) kaa ek bhaag he, jo bi koshika ko sharir main vishisht pratijan kaa pataa lagane kii anumati detaa he or bi koshika sakriyan shuru karata he
 The BCR is composed of surface-bound igd or igm and is associated with Ig-α and Ig-β heterodimers, which are capable of transferring signals
 ek saamaanya maanav bi koshika kii sataha se 5 xxrep 4 0 se 1 xxrep 5 0 pratipind jude hote hai
 After joining the antigen, they appear as large spots on lipid rafts that can grow more than 1 micrometer in diameter, separating the BCR from another cell indicating the receptor
 ye dhabbe celular pratiraksha pratikriya kii dakshata main sudhaar kar sakate hai
 In humans, the cell surface is bare for several thousand angstorms around the b cell receptor, which further differentiates BCR from competing effects
 pratipind vibhinn prakaaron main uplabdh hai jinhen isotip yaa varg kaha jaataa he
 Five types of antibody isotypes are found in mammalian embryos called iga, igd, ige, igg and igm
 in sabakaa naam aiji / Ig upsarg se shuru hota he jiskaa arth he immunoglobulin, jo pratipind kaa hi ek anya naam he or inke jaivik gunon, kaaryaatmak sthanon, tathaa alag alag pratijanon se nipatane kii kshamta main vibhinnata pai jaati he, jaisaa ki uparokt saarini main darshaya gaya he
 Antibody isotypes of b cell change during cell development and activation
 aparipakv bi koshikaayen, jo kabhi bhi ek pratijan ke sampark main nahin ain, sidhi saadi bi koshikaon ke rup main jaani jaati he tathaa cell sarphase bound form main keval igm isotip ko hi vyakt karti hai
 Upon reaching maturity, b cells begin to express both igm and igd — co-expression of both immunoglobulin isotypes prepares b cells to 'mature' and react to antigens
 bi koshika sakriyan ke pashchaat ek pratijan ke saath koshika se jude pratipind ke anu ke judane kii prakriya hoti he, jiske kaaran koshika vibhajit ho jaati he or ek pratipind banane vaali koshika main parivartit ho jaati he jise plavika koshika kehete hai
 In this active state, the b cell starts producing antibodies in the form of secretion rather than membrane bound form
 sakriy bi koshikaon kii kuch santan koshikaayen isotip parivartan kii prakriya se guzarati hai, ek aisa tantra jo antibody ke ijiem yaa aijidi ko duusare antobody isotip ijii / ige, ijie / iga yaa ijiji / igg main badal detaa he, jinaki pratiraksha pranali main nirdhaarit bhoomikaayen hoti hai
 Antibodies are heavy round-shaped plasma proteins
 unke kuch amino amla avasheshon ke saath chini kii shrinkhlaayein judi hai
 In other words, antibodies are glycoproteins
 prayek pratipind kii mul kaaryaatmak ikai ek immunoglobulin monomer hoti he; sravit antibody ijie / iga kii tarah do aiji / Ig ikaayiyon ke saath dimrik, teliost machhlee ke ijiem kii tarah chaar aiji / Ig ikaayiyon ke saath tetrameric yaa standhari ke ijiem kii tarah paanch aiji / Ig ikaayiyon ke saath pentameric ho sakate hai
 The volatile part of the antibody is its v / v region and the stationary part is the c / c region
 aiji / Ig monomer ek "Y" ke aakaar kaa anu hota he jo chaar polypeptid shrinkhalaaon se mil kar banataa he, do samaan baari shrinkhlaayein or do samaan halki shrinkhlaayein dicelphide bandhanon dwaara judati hai
 Each chain is made up of structural domains known as immunoglobulin effect regions
 in prabhaav kshetron main 70-110 amino amla hota he tathaa inke aakaar va kaaryon ke anusaar inhen vibhinn shreniyon main vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 They have a characteristic immunoglobulin fold, in which two beta sheets form a "sandwich" shape, which are joined by interactions of the conserved cysteine and other charged amino acids
 stanadhariyon main paanch tarah kii aiji / Ig baari shrinkhlaayein pai jaati hai jinhen unani bhashaa ke aksharon: α, δ, ε, γ or μ dwaara darshaya jaataa he
 The type of heavy chain shown defines the square of the antibody; These series are found in iga, IGD, IGE, IGG, and IGM respectively
 vishisht baari shrinkhlaayein aakaar tathaa sanrachana main bhinn hoti hai; α or γ main lagbhag 450 amino amla hote hai, jabaki μ or ε main lagbhag 550 amino amla hote hai
 Each heavy chain has two regions - the stationary region and the unstable region
 The constant region is the same in all antibodies of the same isotype, but differs in antibodies of different isotypes
 baari shrinkhalaaon γ, α or δ kaa sthir kshetra teen agranukramon aiji / Ig prabhaav kshetra se bana hota he, tathaa atirikt lacheelepan ke liye hinj kshetra hota he, jabaki μ or ε baari shrinkhalaaon kaa sthir kshetra chaar immunoglobulin prabhaav kshetra se bana hota he
 The volatile region of the heavy chain differs according to the antibodies produced by different b cells, but is the same for all antibodies produced by a single b cell or b cell clone
 prayek baari shrinkhalaa kaa asthir kshetra 110 amino amla jitna lanbaa hota he or ekal aiji / Ig prabhaav kshetra se bana hota he
 There are two types of immunoglobulin light chains in mammals called lambda and kappa
 ek halki shrinkhalaa ke do kramik prabhaav kshetra hai : ek sthir prabhaav kshetra or ek asthir prabhaav kshetra
 halki shrinkhalaa kii lambaai lagbhag 211 se 217 amino amla hoti he
 Each antibody has two light chains, which are always identical; In mammals, only one type of light chain κ or λ is present in a antibody
 duusare prakaar kii halki shrinkhlaayein jaise ki iota shrinkhalaa, nichali shrenee ke rishadhariyon jaise condrikthayis or teleostei main pai jaati hai
 Some parts of the antibody have specific functions
 udhaaharan ke liye, y kii bahon main wo sthaan hota he jo antigen ko baandhta he or is prakaar, vishisht bahari vastuon ko pahachaanata he
 This area of antibody is called fab region
 yah antibody kii prayek baari tathaa halki shrinkhalaa ke ek sthir tathaa ek asthir kshetra se mil kar bana hota he
 The paratope is located at the amino terminal end of the antibody monomer by different domains of light and heavy chains
 asthir kshetra ko epavi / FV kshetra bhi kaha jaataa he or yah antigen ko jodne ke liye sabase mahatvapurn kshetra he
 Three volatile rings, each located specifically on light chains, are responsible for binding to the antigen
 ye challe utprerak nirdhaaran kshetra kehalaate hai
 In the structure of immune network theory, CDR / CDR is also known as idiotype
 pratiraksha network siddhant ke anusaar, idiotip kii prakriyaaon dwaara anukulan pratiraksha pranali vinayamit hoti he
 The basis of y organizes immune cell activity
 yah kshetra epasi / Fc kshetra kehalaata he or yah do baari shrinkhalaaon se mil kar bana he, jo pratipind ke varg ke aadhaar par do yaa teen sthir prabhaav kshetra kaa yogadan dete hai
 The Fc / Fc region associating with a particular protein ensures that each antibody reacts appropriately to the given antigen
 The Fc / Fc region also binds to other cell receptors such as the Fc / Fc receptor and other immune molecules such as complement proteins
 aisa karne se, yah opsoniteeshan, koshika apghaton sahit vibhinn shaareerik prabhaavon kii madhyasthata karata he, jiname mast koshikaon, sanyoji oottak koshikaon tathaa safed rakt koshikaon kaa digrenulation shaamil he
 Activated b cells differentiate into either antibody-producing cells, also known as plasma cells, secreted into soluble antibodies, or long-lasting memory cells in the body, so that the immune system can remember the antigen and repopulate it
 Could react quickly upon appearing
 jivan ke janmpurv or navjaat charnon main, pratipind maa se niskriy tikaakaran dwaara praapt hote hai
 Early endogenous antibody production varies for different types of antibodies and usually appears within the first year of life
 chunki pratipind raktadhara main swatantra hote hai, inhen shaareerik pratiraksha pranali kaa hi bhaag kaha jaataa he
 Flowing antibodies are produced by clonal b cells that specifically react to only one antigen
 Antibodies contribute to immunity in three ways
 ve rogakaarakon ke saath jud kar unhen koshikaon main ghusane yaa nasht karne se rokte hai; ve shwet rakt koshikaon tathaa anya koshikaon ko rogakaarak kii coating dwaara rogakaarakon ko nasht karne ke liye uttejit karte hai; or ve rogakaarakon kaa vinaash shuru karne ke liye duusari roganashak pratikriyaaon jaise utprerak maarg ko uttejit karte hai
 Antibodies that attach to the antigen's surface, for example a bacterium, attract the first component of the catalytic process from their Fc / Fc region and initiate activation of the "noble" catalytic system
 iske parinamswaroop jeevanu do tarah se marataa he
 In the first method, antibodies and catalytic molecules by the ionisation process mark the microorganism to be eaten by the phagocyte, attracted by the catalytic molecules produced by the phagocyte catalytic process
 duusare tareeke main, utprerak pranali ke kuch ghatak jeevanuon ko sidhe maarane main pratipind kii sahaayta ke liye jhillinuma aakraamak samooh bana lete hai
 To counter self-replicating pathogens outside the cells, antibodies bind them together to bind together, which they cling to
 chunki ek pratipind ke kam se kam do paratope hote hai, ye in pratijanon kii sataha par sthit samaan epitope ko jod kar kar ek se adhik pratijan ko baandh sakate hai
 By coating the pathogens, antibodies stimulate the effector functions in cells against the pathogens that recognize their Fc / Fc region
 coted rogakaarakon ko pahchaanane vaali koshikaon main epasi / Fc receptor hote hai, jaisaa ki naam se spasht he - ijie, ijiji or ijii pratipindon ke epasi / Fc kshetra ke saath prakriya karte hai
 The association of a particular antibody with the Fc / Fc receptor on a particular cell promotes motile function in that cell, the phagocyte will become phagocytose, mast cells and neutrophils will degranulate, natural killer cells will release cytokines and cytotoxic molecules that eventually attack the invading microbe
 Will destroy the creatures
 Fc / Fc are based on receptor isotypes that awaken only the appropriate immune mechanisms for specific pathogens, providing extreme flexibility to the curative system
 manushya or isse upar ke str ke standhari bhi "prakritik pratipind" utpann karte hai jo viral sankraman se pehle serum main maujuud rahete hai
 Natural antibodies are antibodies produced without any previous infection, vaccination, contact with other external antigens, or passive immunization
 ye antibody utkrisht utprerak maarg ko sakriy kar virus kanon ko anukulan pratiraksha prakriya ke sakriy hone se pehle apaghatit kar sakate hai
 Several natural antibodies are directed against disaccharide glactose α-glactose, which are found as terminal sugar on glycosylated cell surface proteins and are produced against the production of this sugar by bacteria located in the intestine of humans
 mana jaataa he ki angon ke pratyaropan kii asweekruti isi kaaran se hoti he ki praptakarta ke serum main pravaahit prakritik pratipind daankarta ke utakon ke α-gal pratijanon ke saath jud jate hai
 Almost all germ antibodies can initiate the process

 VJ J) is known as the b cell during recombination, after generating a functional immunoglobulin gene, it cannot express any more unstable region), so each b cell has only one type of unstable chain antibody
 Can generate
 antigen se sakriyan ke baad, bi koshikaayen sankhya main tezi se badhane lagati hai
 In these rapidly dividing cells, the genes encoding the unstable regions of the heavy and light chains pass through a high rate of inflection, through a process known as somatic hypermutation

 At some point, changes will produce antibodies that have weaker reactivity than their antigen than the original antibody, and some changes will produce strong reactive antibodies
 b cells that express high affinity antibodies on their surface will find strong signs of survival during the reaction with other cells while low affinity antibodies will not receive this signal and are eliminated by apoptosis
 In this way, b cells expressing antibodies with high affinity for antigen will outperform antibodies with low affinity in function and life
 The process of generating antibodies with high affinity affinity is called affinity maturation

 The term anticorper appears at the end of his article "experimental Studies on Immunity" published in October 1891, stating that "if two substances promote two different anticorpers, they must be mutually distinct"
 

 However, the term was not immediately accepted and several other terms for antibodies were proposed, including immunocorpor, embosser, Vishencorp, all
 Tans included words such Sensibilisetris, Kopula, Desmon, Filosaites, Fiksecr and Imyunijhm

 In the light of it, there is an interview of self-realization

 In Mandukyopanishat, the past, future or present and future is called trikala-onkarta

 To understand Pranav, his analysis is necessary
 yahan prasiddh aagmon kii prakriya ke anusaar vishleshan kriya kaa kuch digdarshan karaayaa jaataa he

 The point is half-way

 In fact, the speed of the amrit starts from the point itself
 tantra shaastra main is prakaar kaa matravibhag nau naadon kii sookshm yogabhumiyaan ke naam se prasiddh he
 In this context, it is worth remembering that Bindu is the name of the impenetrable knowledge of the Vedas, and Nada is the name of the Vimarshan of the Ashekas
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki a, u or m pranav ke in teen avyavon kaa atikaraman karne par arthtatv kaa avashya hi bhed ho jaataa he
 The reason for this is that here the yogi attains omniscience for the knowledge of all things, and then, after being pointed out, he also transcends that knowledge
 arth or gyaan in donon ke upar keval naad hi avshisht rahata he evam naad kii nadant tak kii gati main naad kaa bhi bhed ho jaataa he
 At that time only art or power exists

 "u" vishnu kaa vaachak hai; uskaa tyaag kanth main hota he tathaa "m" rudra kaa vaachak he ore uskaa tyaag talumadhya main hota he
 Through this system, the perforation of the Brahmagranthi, Vishnugranthi and Rudragranthi is done

 The point in the graft is sacrificed

 He has to be sacrificed in the place from frontal to idol
 yahan tak kaa anubhav sthool he
 Before this, there is a subtle experience of power in the business and samana lands
 is bhoomi ke vachya shiv hai, jo sadashiv se upar tathaa paramshiv se neeche rahete hai
 On the idol, the infinite power of immersion is also sacrificed and the businessman is also abandoned on it
 us samay keval manan maatr rup kaa anubhav hota he
 This is the introduction of Samana Bhoomi

 After this, for some time there is a glimpse of pure self-realization in the past
 iske ananthar hi permanugrahprapt yogi kaa unmana shakti main pravesh hota he
 This should be understood as the attainment of Paramapada or Param Shiva and this can also be considered as a renunciation of manna

 Chanting it while sitting in Padmashan gives peace and concentration to the mind, scientists and astrologers say that the use of teeth, nose, tongue is all used in reciting the Oum and Ekakshari Mantra, which reduces hormonal secretion and By reducing glandular secretion, this word protects against many diseases and awakens the seven chakras of the body

 There are also cowboys or cattle managers in many other parts of the world, particularly in South America and Australia, who perform similar jobs as cowboys in their countries
 spain or americon ke shuruaati europea adhivaasiyon main couboy kii gahari aitihaasik jaden paayi jaati hai
 Over the centuries, differences in terrain, climate and the influence of the shepherd traditions of many cultures led to the creation of many different styles of equipment, costumes and animal management

 The English word cowboy has its origins in many old terms, in both eras it has come to the care of cattle or cattle
 angreji bhashaa main "couboy" shabd 1725 memprakat hua
 It appears to be a direct English translation of vaquero, which is a Spanish word used to refer to a horse and cattle caretaker
 yah vaaka shabd se vyutpann he, jiskaa arth hota he "cou", jo ki latin shabd vaakka se aayaa he
 Another English word for cowboy is bakaru, which is an Englishization of vaquero
 kam se kam ek bhashavid kaa anumaan he ki bakaaru shabd arabi bhashaa ke bakra yaa bakhra shabd se vyutpann he, jiskaa arth bhi "hifer" yaa "bachhiya" hota he or sadiyon ke islamic shashan ke dauraan yah shabd spanish main pravesh kar gaya ho saktaa he
 Originally, the word literally could mean - "a boy who cares for cows
" " 1849 tak yah america pashchim ke ek vayask charvaahe yaa maveshi prabandhakarta ke rup main aadhunik arth main viksit ho gaya
 Variations in the word "cowboy" later emerged
 1852 main "couhand" or 1881 main "coupok" shabd prakat hue, jiskaa prayog mul rup se potparivahan ke liye maweshiyon ko ek lambey barche se konch-konch kar train ke dibbon main ladane vaale vyaktiyon ke liye hi kiya jaataa
 america angreji main coubwoy ke naamon main bakaaru, coupok, couhand or coupanchar shaamil hai
 The term "cowboy" is common throughout the West and especially in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, while "buckaroo" is used primarily in the Great Basin and California, and "cowpuncher" is used mostly in Texas and surrounding areas
 couboy shabd mahaj spanish kaa anuwaad hone ke bajaae isaki jade angreji bhashaa main bhi hai
 Originally, the English word "cowherd" was used for a shepherd, just like a shepherd or shepherd) and was called before a teenager or for a teenage boy, who usually worked on foot
 
 The word is very old in the English language, it originated before the year 1000

 Due to the need for time and physical ability to develop the necessary skills, cowboys often began their careers as a teenager, earning sufficient wages once they had enough skills and were not crippled by injuries
 However, cattle or horses could be taken care of for life
 sanyukt rajya america main, kuch mahilaon ne bhi maweshiyon kii dekhbhaal kaa kaarybhaar sambhala or aavashyak kaushal siikhaa, haalanki "cougirl" ko 19veen sadi kii samaapti tak vyapak rup se manyata yaa abhiswikruti nahin mili thi

 Such youth, in their late teens, are often given the responsibility of "cowboys" in animal farms and are qualified to do work that requires maturity and discretion, which is not usually expected from their urban peers

 Seeing the beginning of the railroad and increased demand for beef during the American Civil War, iconic American cowboys evolved by combining old traditions with the need to move animals from animal farms to the nearest railway station, often hundreds of miles away
 
 america couboy anek sroton se taiyaar hue

 a large number of bonded african-americans also entered cowboy life, partly because there was not as much discrimination in the West at that time than in other areas of American society
 ek badi taadaad main us kshetra main rahane vaale mexican or america indiens bhi couboy ke rup main kaam kiya karte the
 Many early vaqueros were Indians, who were trained to take care of cattle in Spanish missions
 baad main, khaskar 1890 ke baad, indian logon ke saath "sammilan" kii jab america niti bani, tab kuch indian awasaiya vidyalayon main bhi pashupaalan kii vidya di jane lagi
 Today, some Native Americans in the western United States have their own cattle and small farms, and many are still working as cowboys, especially at animal farms close to the Indian reservations
 "indian cowboy" appearances on rodeo circuits have also become commonplace
 chunki us avadhi kii saamaajik sanrachana main couboy kaa sthaan neeche hua karata tha, so vibhinn naslon ke vaastavik anupaat ke pukhta aankade uplabdh nahin hai
 One author states that cowboys "


 belonged to two classes - one recruited from Texas and other states of the Eastern Slope; and the other being Mexicans from the southwestern region
 


" janaganana record ke anusaar sabhi couboy main se 15% africa- america vanshaj the-jiname se 25% texas se baahar chale gayi, unamem se bahut kam uttar-pashchim kii ore gayi
 Similarly, the number of cowboys of Mexican ancestry averaged 15% of the total, but they were very common in Texas and the Southwest
 vibhinn nasl ke baavjood, adhikansh couboy nichle saamaajik virgon ke hi the or unhen bahut kam mazdooree mila karti thi
 The average cowboy earned about a dollar a day, in addition to food, and usually found a bed in an open room, such as a bunkhouse, in a barracks building
 arddh-junglee ilaakon main khule sthanon main badi sankhya main maweshiyon ko rakhaa jaataa or unhen saal ke zyaadaatar samay, adhikanshtah bina rakhwali ke charne ke liye chhod diya jaataa tha
 In many cases, various animal farm owners formed "associations" and left their cattle to graze at one place
 jaanwaron par apane swaamitv ke nirdhaaran ke liye un par ek vishisht brands chihnit kar diya jaataa, iske liye garm lohe kaa istemaal kiya jaataa, aam taur par tab jab maveshi bachade hua karte

 Farm owners usually collected animals in the spring to mark young calves and intended to sell mature animals
 Both cowboys and horses require a wide range of skills to gather or roundup

 Once the cattle were separated, most of the cowboys would tie young calves and then mark them and castrate them
 Sometimes it would also be necessary to tame large cattle for marking or other treatment

 kuch maamalon main, ghodon ko vash main karne ke liye behad krur tareekon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha or aise pashu kabhi bhi puri tarah se vishwasaneey nahin hua karte the
 However, other cowboys felt the need to treat animals more humanely and improved their horse training method, often re-learning techniques used by vaquero, especially techniques from the California tradition
 vinamr dhang se prashikshit kiye gayi ghode adhik vishwasaneey hote the or vibhinn prakaar ke kaamon ke liye upyogi the
 An informal competition between cowboys began to test their skills of handling cattle and horses, and thus, the rodeo competition evolved from the essential tasks of working cowboys
 madhya 19veen sadi se pehle, adhikansh pashu farm ke maalik mukhya rup se apni jaruraton ke liye pashupaalan kiya karte or adhishesh maance tathaa khaal sthaneey rup se bech diya karte the
 The market for skins, horns, hoofs and fats was also limited in various manufacturing processes
 rashtriya str par, 1865 se pehle, gomance kii maang bhi kam thi
 However, after the end of the American Civil War, Philip Danforth Armor opened a meat packing plant in Chicago, which became known as Armor & Company, and the expansion of the meat packing industry led to a significant increase in demand for beef
 1866 se, uttari bazaaron main maveshi beche ja sakate the $40 prati kii dar se, isse bazaar se dur maveshi paalan karnaa sambhavi rup se laabhadaayak ho gaya, khaskar texas se
 For the first time in 1866, an effort was made to move cattle from Texas to a nearby railway station for the purpose of mass shipping to Chicago; At that time, many cattle farm owners united to take their cattle to the nearest railway station, which was then in Sedalia, Missouri
 However, farmers in eastern Kansas were afraid that local cattle from clovehorn might cause cattle fevers, as well as fear of trampling of crops, causing farmers to form groups and warn that their land Cattle personnel found will be beaten or shot
 Therefore, this campaign of 1866 failed to reach the railroad and herds of cattle were sold at low prices
 haalanki, 1867 main, abilene, consas main railway stesan ke aasapaas farm country ke pashchim main ek maveshi potvahan suvidha kaa nirmaan kiya gaya or wo sthaan maveshi potvahan kaa ek centre ban gaya, us saal vahaan se 36,000 maweshiyon ko ladaa gaya
 That route from Texas to Abilene became known as the Chisholm route, as that route was marked by Jessie Chisholm
 yah vartmaan oklahoma se hokar gujarata tha, jo us samay indian kshetra tha
 However, despite Hollywood's portrayals of the West, there were relatively few conflicts with homegrown Americans, who generally allowed herds of cattle to pass in lieu of a tax of ten cents per cattle
 baad main, vibhinn railway steshnon ke liye anya maarg banaae gayi, inamen doj city or vicita, consas ke maarg shaamil hai
 By 1877, 500,000 head of cattle had been shipped from large cattle-shipping cities such as Dodge City, Kansas
 maweshiyon ko haankane ke kaam main maweshiyon kii gati or unke vajan ke bich santulan banaae rakhana jaruri tha
 While cattle can be manhandled up to 25 miles in a day, their weight would be reduced so much that it would be difficult to sell them by reaching the destination
 They were usually taken to short distances daily, allowed to rest and graze in the afternoon and night
 On average, an animal group can maintain a healthy weight by walking 15 miles per day
 is gati kaa matlab hua ki pashu farm se railway stesan tak pahunchane main do maheene tak lag jate the
 The Chisholm route, for example, was 1,000 miles long
 ausatan, maweshiyon ke ek jhund ke ek haank abhiyaan main lagbhag 3,000 maveshi hua karte
 maweshiyon ko jhund main le jane ke liye kam se kam 10 couboy kii jarurat padati or ek couboy ke liye teen ghode kii jarurat hoti thi
 Cowboys worked 24-hour shifts to monitor cattle, to move them in the right direction during the daytime and to prevent stampede and thieves at night
 karmiyon main ek bawarchi bhi shaamil hota, jo ek bhojan vaahan chalaaya karata, aam taur par jis par ek bail juta hota or ek ashwapal hota jiske jimme remuda yaa atirikt ghodon kaa tabela hua karata
 maweshiyon ke haank abhiyaan ke samay ashwapal aksar bahut hi jawan couboy hua karata yaa nimna saamaajik darje kaa, lekin bawarchi vishesh rup se karmi dal kaa ek bahut hi sammanit sadsy hota, jo na keval bhojan kaa prabharee hota, balki uske jimme chikitsa aapurti bhi hua karti or use praayogic aushadhi kaa kaamchalaoo jaankaree bhi hua karti thi
 By the 1880s, the expansion of the cattle industry necessitated the need for additional open spaces or extent
 tab anek pashu farm maalikon ne uttar-pashchim main vistaar kiya, jahaan tab bhi avyavhrut bade ghaas ke maidan maujuud the
 Texas cattle moved northward into the Rocky Mountain West and Dakota
 couboy ne thandi paristhitiyon ke anusaar khud ko dhaal liya or pashchim kii ore jane vaale udyog ne california se texas tak ke anek kshetreey paramparaon ke saath khud ko antarmishrit kar liya, aksar hi couboy ne prayek ke sabase upyogi tatwon ko khud main samahit kar liya
 Starting in the 1880s, barbed wire kept cattle in a particular area, so that the cattle would not move beyond the limits in that area
 In Texas and surrounding areas, population growth made animal farm owners feel the need to encircle their land
 uttar main, khule kshetra main seemaa se adhik char lene ke kaaran jaade main maweshiyon ke liye chaare kaa abhaav ho jaataa, jisase bhukhmaree kaa saamana karnaa padataa, khaskar 1886-1887 ke bhayaavah jaade ke samay, jab uttar-pashchim main lakhon maweshiyon kii mrityu ho gayi, jisase maveshi udyog kaa patan ho gaya tha
 By the 1890s, barbed wire fences became standard in the northern flat areas as well, with railroads expanded to cover most of the nation and meat packing plants were built close to large animal farm areas, from Texas to Kansas railway stations
 The long hank drive to bring cattle became unnecessary
 is vajah se, khule kshetra kaa ant hua or maweshiyon ke bade haank abhiyaan samaapt hue

 Meanwhile, cattle ranches continued to grow throughout the developing West, cowboy employment also increased, although they continued to receive low salaries, but they also became somewhat inhabited
 samay ke saath, america pashchim ke couboy ne apni nijee samskruti viksit kii, seemaant or victorian mulyon kaa ek mishran jisamen veerta ke avasheshon ko bhi banaae rakhaa gaya
 Such dangerous work in isolated situations also created a tradition of self-reliance and individualism, with a strong emphasis on personal honesty, with lyrics and poems presented

 Beginning in the 1920s, western films to date have popularized the cowboy lifestyle, but at the same time created a constant bias both positively and negatively
 kuch maamalon main, aksar couboy or hinsak hatyare ko ek-duusare ke saath jod diya jaataa he
 On the other hand, some actors playing the role of cowboys promoted positive values, such as Jean Autry's "cowboy Code", which encouraged respectful behavior, respect and patriotism
 isi tarah, filmon main couboy ko america indian ke saath ladate hue aksar dikhaaya gaya he
 However, the reality is that cowboys were armed against robbers and human thieves and often used guns to attempt to steal cattle or to evade those who illegally carried them, while virtually all actual armed conflict took place among the Indian people

 The history of women working in the West, and especially in animal farms, is not as well documented as men
 haalanki, neshnal cougirl museum or haul of fame jaise sansthaanon ne haal ke varshon main mahilaon ke yogadan ko ikattha karne or unke dastauez taiyaar karne main mahatvapurn prayaas kiya he
 There are some records of mention of cattle being hauled by women as far as the cattle routes of the Old West
 haalanki, mahilaon ne pashu formon main kaaphi kaam kiya he or kuch maamalon main to unhen chalaaya bhi he
 There is no doubt that women, especially the wives and daughters of the owners of small farms, have worked shoulder to shoulder with men who could not keep large numbers of outside workers; And that's why they needed the ability to complete horse riding and related tasks
 The non-documented contributions of women from the West have been largely acknowledged in law; Western states have led the United States in the right to vote for women, beginning with Wyoming in 1869
 evalin camerun jaise praarambhik photographeron ne 19veen ke ant or 20veen sadi ke prarambh main pashu formon main kaam karne vaali mahilaon or cougirl ke jivan ko pralekhith kiya
 Although impractical for day-to-day work, the side saddle was an instrument that enabled women to ride a horse in "respectable" public spaces, rather than being restricted to walking or walking
 grih yuddh ke baad, charles gudnit ne paaramparik angreji bagal kii lathi main sudhaar laakar ek paashchaatya-style dizin kaa nirmaan kiya
 The traditional Charas of Mexico maintained a similar tradition, and today the sideradale rides are held in Charreida exhibitions on either side of the border

 In films since the early 20th century, cowgirls expanded their role in popular culture and film designers developed attractive clothing suitable for riding on western genes

 mahilaon ko aamtaur par purushon kii pratispardhaa se nikaal diya gaya or mahilaon kii kai pratispardhaaen kam kar di gayin
 In today's rodeos, only in team roping can men and women compete equally together, although women can technically enter other open events as well
 sakal-mahila rodio bhi hai, jahaan mahilaayein bronk sawari, sand kii sawari or anya sabhi paaramparik rodio pratispardhaa main bhaag le sakati hai
 However, in open rodeos, cowgirls can participate primarily in fixed-time competition such as barrel racing, while most professional rodeos have fewer female competitions than male competitions

 Rodeo participates in almost all equestrian competitions, including the Olympics, outside of the world in the same way as men, and can also take part in western rides such as cutting, rein and patience

 In the modern world, remains of two major cowboy traditions are found, known today as the "texas" tradition and the "spanish", "vaquero" or "california" tradition

 aaj, vibhinn kshetreey couboy paramparaon kaa kuch had tak vilay ho chukaa he, haalanki upkaran or sawari style main kuch kshetreey antar ab bhi bache hue hai
 And, some people have deliberately chosen the way to preserve the purely vaquero or "bakaru" tradition equipped with more time-consuming but highly efficient techniques

 Residents here were heavily influenced by Mexican vaquero culture, embracing the local people's vocabulary and attire, but at the same time preserving some of the traditions of cattle handling and the culture of the eastern United States and Great Britain
 texas ke couboy aamtaur par kunvaare hua karte, jinhen mausam ke hisaab se vibhinn kaamon ke liye niyukt kiya jaataa
 After the American Civil War, vaquero culture disintegrated to the east and west, combining with the eastern United States traditions of cow farming that developed as settlers moved westward

 Thus, Texas' cowboy tradition arose from a combination of cultural influences, in addition to the need to adapt with the geography and climate of West Texas and the long herd of cattle to carry to market

 Residents of the United States entered California only after the mexican-american War, and earlier settlers worked mostly in mines rather than on animal farms, leaving animal husbandry primarily to Spanish and Mexican who Loved living in California

 In addition, California's geography and climate differed dramatically from Texas, with less intensive areas grazing more intensively; Also, California cattle were sold mainly locally, so they did not have to travel hundreds of miles up the railroads

 Florida cowboys did not use the lasso to capture or collect cattle

 Since the Florida cowhunter did not require the elongated part of the saddle to anchor the lasso, many did not use the westernized gene, instead they would have used the mcclellan gene
 Some people wore boots above the knee for protection from snakes, while others wore brogans
 They usually wore cheap wool or khar hats and used ponchos to avoid the rain

 In Australia, where farm owners are known as stations, cowboys are known as stockmen and drovers and are called zilarus)
 The Australian driving tradition was influenced by Americans in the nineteenth century, as well as practices imported directly from Spain
 Adaptation of these two traditions to local needs created a unique Australian tradition, which was greatly influenced by the Australian indigenous public, whose knowledge played a major role in the success of animal husbandry in the Australian climate

 The most important horse in an animal farm is one that performs everyday tasks and that can perform a variety of tasks; Such horses are trained for special work such as separating or trapping cattle from herds, this is very rare in animal farms

 Modern riders may use some safety equipment such as Kevlar vest or neck strap in a "rough stoke" event, such as wearing a wild horse, or riding a bull, but as far as the use of safety helmets is concerned, there is a constant risk of injury
 Despite this, it is yet to be accepted in lieu of a cowboy hat
