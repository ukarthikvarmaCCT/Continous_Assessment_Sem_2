 Over the last two years, he has become more aggressive, reverting to his old way of trying to score runs, while playing for a while trying to save his wicket
 ’unhone kaha, ‘kris tremelet ne 2007 main uske khilaaf acchhee gendbaaji kii thi or ab vah pehle se kahin behatar gendbaaj he
 But Sachin has no weakness, although initially every batsman is a bit nervous on the off stump or on the ball around it
 england unke khilaaf aakraamak ravaiya apana saktaa he, short gendon se uski pariksha le saktaa he
 i have seen people doing this in the last two years and it has not affected them
 ’hossain ne kaha ki haal ke varshon main tendulkar ne apni aakraamakata phir hasil kar lee he
 Hussain said, 'technically and mentally, Sachin has changed a bit over the years but has changed his game plan

 30 minutes) is an absolutely impressionistic film
 jangadh ke gaanv, ghar, parijan, kaarysthal aadi ko yah ek-ek adhyay main bade rahasyatmak andaaj main pesh karti he
 Light, sound, voice, texture means that every aspect of cinema has been used extensively
 khapril ke saamne neem dhundhalake main jangadh ke pita bataate hai ki janaganana ke saal main paidaa hone se bete kaa naam jangadh rakh diya tha
 Another beautiful artistic film was on Pithora patting of Rathwa tribals of Pithoro Chhota Udaipur (gujarat)

 abu said nirdeshit is film main eklavya par film banaate vakt filmkaar aarif ko pataa chalata he ki santhal log to anguuthe se tir-dhanush pakadte hi nahin
 After this the film starts to solve the same mystery as to why Dronacharya sought Eklavya for him even if the thumb is not necessary
 film shuru main hi ek sukhad ghoshnaa karti he ki mahabharat hinduon kaa granth hone ke baavjood us par unka ekadhikaar nahin

 Team captain Mithali Raj, while discussing this defeat in the match, said that the team had come under pressure while chasing a run against England
 haalanki iske saath hi unhone kaha ki unhen yahaan tak pahunchane kaa garv he
 Mithali said, "the way the team performed in the final for the second time in this World Cup, it will improve the position of women's cricket in India and the players will get due attention
 'bataa den ki ravivaar ko lords cricket maidan par khele gaye final match main england team ne bharat ko nau ranon se haraa diya
 At the prize distribution ceremony after the match, Mitaline said, 'yes, i am proud of the team
 england ke liye yah aasaan nahin tha, lekin unhen apana jajba banaae rakhane kaa shrey jaataa he
 There was a time in the match when we were at par, but we got nervous, which led to this defeat
 ' unhone kaha, 'mujhe ladakiyon par kaaphi garv he
 He did not let the match become easy for either team

 All the youngsters on the team gave their best
 'vahiin bhavishya kii yojanaon par puche jane par unhone kaha, 'main nishchit rup se kuch saal or kheloongi, lekin main apane aapako aglaa vishwacap khelte hue nahin dekhati hum
 Mithali also thanked the supporters on the field
 unhone kaha, 'main yahaan mahila cricket kaa samarthan karne aae sabhi prashansakon ko dhanyavad detii hum
 This is a big deal for all women cricketers
 nishchit rup se yah anubhav khilaadiyon kii madad karegaa
 Now we have a different view of women's cricket in our homes
 'vahiin, england kii captain hethar nite ne jeet par khushi jataayi

 unhone saath hi apni team kii tarif kii, jisane dawaab kii sthiti main bikharane kii bajaae apane aap ko sanbhale rakhaa or bharat se jeet chin lee
 Significantly, England had set a target of 229 runs in front of India at Lord's ground, which the Indian team could not achieve and 48

 ranvir singh bollywood ke iklaute aise star hai, jo apane dresses or luk ko lekar hameshaa charchaa main rahete hai
 Once again his hairstyles are in discussion

 In Gully Boy, Ranveer is playing the character of a young man living in Dharavi's slum who wants to spread the magic of his voice to the whole world and become a famous rapper
 ranvir ke kirdaar kaa naam muraad he
 Regarding Ranveer's look, hairstylist Avan states that "the film is based on the gin rappers
 main khud unase milane dharavi gai thi
 During this time, i saw his hairstyle closely and understood
 "avan ke hawaale se pinkavila kii ek report main likhaa he, "sabhi reppers kii hair style international reppers se kaaphi prabhavit thi
 But, there was also a glimpse of simple background somewhere
 is study ke baad maine samajha ki film main ranvir kii hair style bahut hi saadhaaran rakhni hogi
 Hair should be scattered and easy to move, it has to be worked on
 maine bilkul vaisaa hi kiya
 However, Ranvir's hairstyle looks very good in the film and people are also liking him

 The dates for the Rajasthan assembly elections have been announced and the people of the state will exercise their franchise on 7 December
 chunaavon main vot hasil karne ke liye adivasee kshetron main bhi netaa pahunch rahe hai or vot maang rahe hai
 State Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje also started her Gaurav Yatra from the tribal area itself, where Bhil caste is predominant
 rajasthan ke mewar kii 28 main se 16 siton par bhil jati ke matadaata ahm bhoomika nibhaate hai or kisi bhi party yaa netaa kii haar-jeet main unka ahm yogadan hota he
 Although the majority of the Bhil caste is in the rural areas of southern Rajasthan ie Dungarpur, Banswara, Pratapgarh and Udaipur, but the Bhola community also lives in the quota area of the locality
 anusuchit janajati varg main aane vaali bhil jati kaa itihaas bhi kaaphi purana he
 It is said that the Bhils supported Maharana Pratap in the fight
 bhil shabd kii utpatti 'bill' se hui he, jiskaa arth he 'kaman'
 Many Bhils are also called Vanaputras
 bhil janajatirajasthan kii pramukh pracheen janajati he
 Just as the states of the Meenas existed before the rise of the Rajputs in northern Rajasthan, similarly there have been many small states of Bhils in southern Rajasthan and Hadoti region
 bhil shabd, us varg vishesh ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa tha, jo dhanush-baan se shikaar karke apana pet-paalan karte the
 It is said that Eklavya was also Bhil
 teesri badi janajatibhil desh main teesri sabase badi janajati he
 Many books state that the king used to sit on the throne only after tilak with Bhil's blood
 ped kii puja karne vaale bhil aam or pipal ko pramukh maanate hai
 The customs of the Bhils are also quite different and in this tribe the wedding ceremony lasts for 9 days
 is samaaj ke log bhili or vagadi bhashaa bolte hai
 Some areas of Dungarpur, Banswara and Udaipur in Rajasthan are called 'vagad'
 vaagad ek adivasee bahul kshetra he
 The Bhils are a very conservative caste, who are vigilant about their social and economic status
 bhil jati ke logon ne hi angrejon se lekar anya shaskaon kaa kaaphi virodh kiya he or itihaas kii kai ladaaiyon main ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 Now that Rajasthan is going to elect a new government once again, in such a situation the role of Bhil tribe will also prove to be decisive

 That is why, by narrating a lion of Dastango Shire Wali Assi, he narrates the importance of telling the story to everyone, "I have never forgotten even now, whom i want to tell the story of
 '' yah himanshu bajpeyi hai jo philvakt desh ke sabase jane-maane daastangoi kalakaaron main ek hai
 Dastangoi means the art of telling long stories of special style in Urdu
 yah vaachik parampara se judi kala he jo madhyakaal main apane shabaab par thi lekin 1928 ke aasapaas khatm ho gai
 This art was revived in 2005 with the efforts of Urdu critics Shamsur Rahman Farooqui and Ustad Mahmood Farooqui
 baad ke varshon main jo yuva ji-jaan se is kala se jude unamem lakhanu ke himanshu bajpeyi pramukh hai
 They have countless stories
 nai-puraani, choti-badi, hansaane vaali, rulaane vaali
 
 
 All kinds of stories
 jab ve daastaan sunaate hai, to samay, sanvaadon, charitron or ghatnaon ko jivit kar dete hai or sunne vaale bhi usee daastaan ke kirdaar ban jate hai
 The Kakori scandal and the story of revolutionaries, Gandhiji's story, mango's story of fruits, Kaifi Azmi's story, etc
 are some of his famous stories
 hindustan ke alag-alag shaharon main sattar se zyada sho karne ke alaava ve turki, sanyukt arab emirate or singapore aadi main alag-alag jagah par kai sho kar chuke hai
 This year he was also seen narrating the story in season 2 of the highly popular series net-flix Sacred Games
 daastangoi ke alaava unki ek damdaar pahchaan lekhak ke bataur bhi he
 His book, kisa-kisa Lakhnauva, which came out this year from Rajkamal Publication, became a bestseller
 sirf saat maheene main iske teen sanskaran aa chuke hai
 There is an anecdote in this book too

 Himanshu had done journalism before starting Dastangoi
 patrakarita se daastangoi main kaise aae, iskaa jawaab dete hue ve bataate hai, ''mere dost marhoom ankit chaddha, jo hamaari peedi ke sarvshereshth or sarvottam daastango rahe hai, mujhe haath pakadakar daastangoi main le aae
 The way i wanted to say it was difficult to say in journalism, at the same time Ankit inspired me to call it story
 phir ankit hi mujhe ustad mahmud faruki ke paas le gaye or 2013 main unki daastangoi kii workshop join karwaai
 Thus began the journey of Himanshu in the form of Dastango
 2014 main ankit ke saath unki sunai pehali daastaan hi unki jindagi kaa terning point sabit hui
 After the joy he got in listening to it and the response of the listeners, Himanshu decided not to do anything anymore, full time is just to tell the story
 jab unhone apane ghar main bataaya ki ve aage naukari nahin karnaa chaahate or daastangoi ko phul time profeshan ke taur par apana rahe hai to ghar main chintaa pasar gai
 His father Arun Kumar Abbajpayee, a government teacher and farmer, initially wanted Himanshu to join Dastangoi with a job
 lekin dhire-dhire jab kamyaabi milane lagi to pita kii chintaa kam hoti gai
 These days Himanshu is busy preparing some new stories, one of which is on his Mehboob city Lucknow
 saath hi unka sapana sadak ke raste desh bhar main gum-gum kar daastaan sunaane kaa bhi he
 They say that Dastangoi has a bright light because India is a story of stories
 ye sarajameen hajaaron saal se kahaniyon or kahani sunaane waalon ko navajti aa rahi he
 This is also the reason for his success

 Its eyelashes also flicker
 kabhi-kabhi halki muskaan bhi bikher detaa he
 Then another human being enters the stage
 ye hai elborg uniwarsity ke professor henrik sharf
 Professor Heinrich explains that this 'human' sitting on the stage in front of you is actually a 'robot'
 itnaa sunate hi darshak ddeergha main baithe log chaunk jate hai

 log manch kii taraf nazren gadaaye america main bane bhavishya ke is robot ko to dekh hi rahe hai, professor kii baaten bhi dhyaan se sun rahe hai
 The sixth session of India Today Conclave showed a strange adventure
 is seshan main professor henrik ne 'humanoid robot' (humanoid Robot) pesh kiya
 The professor said that most of today's robots can move around in a limited way, but in the coming days there will be more robots who will be more 'active'
 insaanon kaa zyaadaatar kaam kar denge bhavishya ke robotaenrik kehete hai ki bhavishya ke robot ke paas zyada netwarking kshamta hogi
 Certainly, they will be more intelligent, will be able to share more information with their favorites

 That is, they will also have their own mind
 itnaa bataane ke baad professor logon ke saamne kuch sawaal bhi rakhte hai
 Should these future robots need a social security number? Should a robot be passport issued? The professor also answers
 kehete hai, in mashiinon ko hamen prerit hi karne dijie, taaki ham or creative soch saken, kyonki hamaare par kudarat kaa jo sabase anmol tohfa he, wo he insaan
