 And before that the Kafirs used to pray for blessings when they came to know what they knew, then it is a shame for God to deny the Kafirs, what is the worse thing that they are losing their lives in respect of God, with his own friends, whoever he has chosen to book with his own grace, disobeying everything that God has revealed with this blood For the Kafirs and the Kafirs, Roussewai has a wonder and when he was told that God has believed in him, then believe that we have come to believe in the same book which was revealed to us and that book which was then i have not believed, even though it is a right, and it also admits the book that they have, but they deny the book that has come after them
 Ask them if you were honest then why open it? Da was former killed the prophets and you have Moses Vajeya and Raushan had already come with fun, yet you made the calf after them, and you were going to torture yourself by that and when we took you away and hanged the head on your head and what we have given you reliably
 Keep and listen, then you start saying, we do not believe it and because of their dishonesty, they were fed in the hearts of the calf's slaughter in their hearts and tell them that if you were honest you How bad did you believe that you should tell these people that if the last house near God is special for you and people do not like it, if you are true then start death, but because of those immorality Those whom their hands have already sent ahead, they certainly will not face death and God is very well aware of the oppressors and you will find them the highest green of life and in Mushriq Every person wants to be given a thousand years of age, however Even if given such a dull age, he is not going to relieve himself from the wonders of God, and God is watching everything that he does, say that he is the enemy of Jibreil because that angel has poured on your heart with the command of God And he also appeals to the books that are present in front of him and there is good news for the believers who revere the man and his angels and his apostles and Jibraeel and Michael If you are a shaman, then of course God is also an enemy of kafirs and we have made such markings on you which are waja and light and no one can deny them except such disbelievers and their condition is that whenever someone dies, one of them Fariq broke it, but most of them often do not believe and when Rasul came to them from God and also confirmed the book that he has, then one of those Ahle book Iroh threw his paise Pusht the books Khuhda Goya that people know No and fell behind the mantra that was chanted in the Sultanate of Sultan's time, although Suleman did not do kufr, but the devils practiced kufr that he used to bring magic to the people and the things that both Harut and Marut angels It was revealed in the Bible, although both of these angels did not teach anyone, until they said that both of us are fair, i am dishonest He used to learn from them on that too, due to which Mia used to take care in wife, however, without Azne God, he could not reach anyone with these things and these people used to learn such things which themselves harm them and bring something Despite that, he knew for sure that the person who bought these people is ultimately uninterested and is very large, instead of which he gave his life Understand not think i wish sold are and that he believed bring and avoiding magic blah Spartan If it was built, it would have been much better than what it would have received from the shrine of God, i wish these people would understand that you do not say that i am a believer, but say it to them and keep listening and it is painful for the infidels
 He and Musherakin do not want that goodness will be passed on to you from your family and God, whom he wants, especially for his mercy And God is very fuzzy
 When we make any rectangle or erase it from your mind, then we make it better or even more like that, don't you know that the uncountable God is the focus on everything, don't you know that the sky The Sultanate is uniquely unique and apart from God, you are neither a patron nor a helper
 Do you want that you also treat your Rasul the same way? In Bikh times were unlocking of Moses and the person who Iman against blasphemy Having done so, he has strayed from the straight path, often in the book Ahle, because of his heartfelt desire, people wish to make you a Kafir after believing that their rights have been revealed, even after that you forgive me And pray even God send his command, of course God is on everything and keep praying and give zakat and whatever goodness you send to yourself will be present
 You will find God is watching everything that you do and says that no one except Jude and Nussaira will be able to go into unconsciousness, it is their thoughtless pilgrimage
 You tell them that if you are true that we will go into unconsciousness Present your argument, yes, the person who bowed his head in front of God and does good work, for that he has his revenge in his family and no such kind of people Huf will and not those Ghmghin will and faith to say Nusara Judah It is not appropriate for such people to go in it, but for such people who have suffered, the world is roused, and for such people, in the end, there is a great wonder, that God is facing the eastern side wherever it is
 Of course, God is very versatile and well versed and the Jews started saying that God keeps children, although he is a pak, but all that is in the ground and in the sky belongs to him and all his They are proud of the sky and the land, and when they decide to do something, then they just say that "ho Ja" is the one that they become and those who do not know why God does not ask us, Or why we don't have any signs, Similarly, they have done the same things that were before them, the hearts of all of them are similar to each other, people who are sure, why have they clearly shown their signs, we have made you good news and fearful You have been sent and you will not be asked anything about the doings, and neither the Jews will ever agree with you nor the Nusaira, even you defend their religion and say that it is free It is instructed and if you go on their wishes even after you have got Ilma, then there will be no guardian to protect you from God nor help people whom we have written in the book (kujihad al-nikah avadhi hindi kshetra kii ek upbhasha he

 The Students of SRCC proudly call themselves srites
 Prominent srites include: vajjika uttar bihar ke us kshetra kii bhashaa he jahaan bhagwaan mahavir or buddha kii janmabhumi evam karmbhumi thi tathaa pratham ganatantratmak vajjisang kaa rajya tha
 Thus, the antiquity and dignity of Vajjika is associated with Vaishali Republic and perhaps its downfall coincided with the fall of Vaishali as well
 yah bhashaa lokkanth main hi jivit rahi he, likhit sahitya ke rup main nahin
 Or it is also possible that its written literature has been destroyed, as happened with many texts of Prakrit Apabhramsa
 vajjika ke swaroop kaa darshan buddha-jain-sahitya se lekar santasahitya tak dekha ja saktaa he
 Indicating the independent existence of this language was Rahul Sankrityayan, who accepted Bhojpuri, Maithili, Magahi and Angika as well as Vajjika as the district language under Hindi in his article "problem of Mother tongues"
 grearsan ne kabhi ise "pashchimi maithili" kaha, kabhi "maithil bhojpuri"
 Grierson saw it as "maithili" by looking at the "G" in Vajjika's verbs
 lekin vajjika or maithili ke is kriyaapad main antar he; jaise - aavi rahal achhi abaichhi or jahaan is kriyaapad kaa prayog maithili main bhoot or vartmaan kaal main hota hai vahaan vajjika main keval vartmaan kaal main hi
 Then, seeing a slightly different form of verbs, he accepted Bhojpuri
 lekin unhen kahan pataa tha ki bhojpuri bhashaa main bahuvachanbodh chihr yaa pratyay ni, na, nh hote hai parantu vajjika main ni ke sthaan par "ni" kaa prayog hota he tathaa anya donon chihr ekadam nahin paae jate
 Then he further writes - "I had described it as a distinction of Bhojpuri in Seven Grammar of the Bihari languages, part two, but in the present survey i am describing it as the division of Maithili because the area in which it is spoken is historically Ancient Mithila is under the kingdom
 " Dr
 Jayakant Mishra and Dr
 Udayanarayan Tiwari have accepted four forms in Maithili and Bhojpuri, respectively - atirashva, hrasva, hyperthis, long; Such as Ghor, Ghor, Ghorwa and Ghorua
 lekin vajjika main atihrasv or atideergh donon hi rup nahin paae jate
 Thus the nature of this language is quite different even with some matching with the latter languages
 is bhashaa ke swatantra astitv or satta ko sweekaar karte hue jagadishchandra maathur or ganesh choube ne to yahan tak kaha he ki tharu bhashaa bhi vajjika hi he
 According to Dr
 Siyaram Tiwari, there is Nepal in the north of the Vajjika region, the Ganges River in the south, Saran and Champaran in the west and Darbhanga district in the east
 is bhashaa main gayadhar, haldar das, manganiram aadi kii kuch rachanaayen praapt hui hai, jahaan se vajjika bhashaa kaa sahitya prarambh hota he
 Gayaadhar's creation period is believed to be 1045 AD
 ye vaishali ke rahanevaale the or buddha-dharm ke prachararth tibet gaye the
 No concrete composition has been found yet
 haldhar das kaa samay 1565 i
 tehraata he, jinka likhaa hua ek khandakavy sudamacharitra praapt he, jo sampurna vajjika main likhaa gaya he
 It is said that he did many compositions in Vajjika
 lekin abhi or koi rachana inaki mili nahin he
 Mangniram's life is believed to be around 1815 AD, whose three books - Mangniram's Sakhi, Ramsagar Pothi and Anmol Ratan - have been found
 inke alaava inke bhajan or saakhi janata main prachlit hai, jinka sankalan sampadan abhi nahin ho paaya he
 The second chapter of the literature of the Vajjika language begins in the 20th century
 is kaal main bahut si rachana sahitya ke vibhinn angon par likhi gai hai or likhi ja rahi hai
 The Buddha written by Ramsanjeevan Singh is a succinct and successful poem of Vaishalik Vajjika language, which represents the success of the poetry of Vajjika language
 dow ajitnarayan singh tomars kaa kahani sangrah -"parachat ke parmaan kii" vajjika bhashasahitya kii kahani vidha ko gauravanvit karata he

 Vijay marries his love Kali, whom is killed by Kancha's men on their wedding day
 vijay apane pita or patni ke khun kaa badla lene mandava pahunch jaataa he par kaancha uski maan or bahan ko pakad kar mandava le aata he

 Hildebrandt, with whom the general met when he was engaged in a military campaign in Piedmont, had in 1602 built the Rakway Palace for him on Sepal, an island in the Danube south of Budapest
 baad main unki seva main unhone kai anya imaaraton kaa bhi nirmaan kiya
 The architect studied civil engineering in Rome under Carlo Fontana and went into royal service in 1695–96 to learn the art of building fortifications
 1696 ke baad ke aankade bataate hai ki ve vienna main ek darbari vaastukar ke rup main karyrat the
 Hildebrandt's outstanding achievements, along with Belvedere's, include the Schaus Hoff Palace which was built by Prince Eugene itself, the Swarzenberg Palace, the Kinski Palace, as well as the entire Gottweg Monastery Estate in the Wachau Valley

 However, a month earlier, the prince had acquired his own royal grand marshal Count Heinrich Franz Mansfield, prince of Fondi, bought neighborhood plots and authorized Hildebrandt to build a garden palace on his land
 bhukhand ko kharidne ke liye rajkumaar ujin ko apane stadpales ke viruddh jamaanat par ek bada rin lene ke liye majaboor hona padaa tha, stadpales bhi abhi tak nirmaan kii prakriya main hi tha
 He purchased additional surrounding areas of the country in 1708, 1716 and again in 1717–18 to expand the garden in phases
 Figures state that the construction of the Upper Belvedere began in 1712 as Prince Eugene dated 5 July 1713
 Was submitted a request for an inspection of the building

 He was inducted into the service of Prince Eugene on the recommendation of Emmanuel
 nichle belvadar or sheeshmahal ko vishesh pradarshaniyon ke manchan ke liye khaas taur par roopantarit kiya gaya tha
 After winning an invitation-only contest, architect Susane Zottal converted the palace into a modern exhibition hall while still retaining the original Baroque fabric of the building
 This scenic spot opened in March 2007 with the exhibition Gartenlust: Der Garten in der Kunst
 kuch maheenon ke baad nichle belvadar ko vienna-paris sho ke saath phir se kholaa gaya
 The reconstruction of the building was completed by Berlin architect Wilfred Kuhn, who brought the entrance back to its place in the Cor d'onier, once again from the main gateway of the lower Belvedere to the garden area of the Upper Belvedere, through the Marble Hall

 Its vast reservoir, steps, and waterfalls in Upper Pushpathika, which feature beautiful young women and goddesses that connect the Upper and Lower Flowerpots, are still in existence today, but grasses have been grown for a long time on the structured bedrock; It is currently being revived
 naveenatam shodh ke anusaar upree belvadar kaa nirmaan kaary kam se kam 1717 main shuru hua tha
 We can indicate this date from the two letters that Prince Eugene sent from Belgrade in the summer of 1718 to his servant Benedetti, describing the progress of the work on the palace
 nirmaan kaary 2 oktober 1719 tak is had tak aage bad gaya tha ki rajkumaar vahaan turki ke rajdoot ibrahim pasha kaa swaagat karne main sakasham the
 It follows that the interior decoration may have begun even earlier than previously thought, in fact it is possible to infer from Prince Eugene's extensive correspondence that the work had been begun in at least 1718
 1719 main unhone donon alterpison pales chapel or golden room ke ceiling fresco ko durust karne ke liye niapolitan chitrakaar francisco solimena ko adhikrut kiya
 In the same year Gaetano Fanti was commissioned to complete the work of painting the Quadrachura containing Mayajala in the Marble Hall
 1720 main carlo carlon ko marble haul main ceiling fresco kii chitrakaari kaa kaary saunpa gaya, jise unhone 1721-23 tak puraa kiya

 It is at least partly thanks to the carvings of Salomon Cleaner that we get so much information today about the interior decoration of the palace complex and the characteristics of landscape architecture

 Inspired by the idea of an enlightened autocratic state, his intention was to make the royal collection accessible to the general public
 gailaree ko paanch saal baad kholaa gaya, jo ise duniya ke sabase pehle saarvajanik sangrahalayon main se ek banaata he
 a series of eminent painters served as directors in charge of the royal collection at Upper Belvedere until 1891 when it was transferred to the newly built Kunsthistorisches Museum on the magnificent Ringsstresse in Vienna

 1811 main samraat francis pratham ne yah faisla sunaaya ki ise nichle belvadar main santhaapit kiya janaa chahie, jo vastav main is sangrah ke liye bahut hi chota tha
 Thus this part of Belvedere was also used as a museum and by the time of the Congress of Vienna it had started attracting a large number of tourists

 This situation remained virtually unchanged until its transfer to the newly constructed Kunsthistorisches Museum in Ringsstrasse in 1888–89
 shahi sangrah ke sthanantaran ke baad donon belvadar mehalon ko kam se kam kuch samay ke liye saarvajanik sangrahalay ke rup main band kar diya gaya
 In 1896, Emperor Francis Joseph i decided that the Upper Belvedere should be used as the residence of his nephew Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne
 The direct-heirs renovated the palace under the supervision of the architect Emil von Forster, who was also the royal deputy minister, and has since served as the residence of Franz Ferdinand
 iske vipareet modern gailaree ko kuch saalon ke baad 2 may 1903 ko nichle belvadar main kholaa gaya
 The museum was the first state collection in Austria dedicated exclusively to modern art and changed its direction from the inspiration of the Union of Austrian Artists known as the Vienna Sesession

 Shakuntala became pregnant with this sex

 Non-political elements indirectly contribute to the running of the political process and for this reason a correct understanding of politics can only be achieved by coordinating them
 isi uddheshy se raajnneetik adhyayan main samaaj, arthvyavastha, dharm, samskruti, bhugol, vigyaan va takneekee, manovigyaan va itihaas jaise sahyogi tatwon ko paryaapt mahatv diya jaataa he
 Political science forms, study materials and its traditions have changed from time to time with contributions from various thinkers, theorists and analysts from the time of the Greek thinkers to the modern period
 tadnurup is vishay kaa nirantar vikaas hota rahaa hai
 In this development, two major approaches have emerged regarding the study of political science: the traditional approach and the modern approach
 parmparik yaa paramparaagat drushtikon rajya-pradhanta kaa parichay detaa he jabaki aadhunik drushtikon prakriya-pradhanta kaa
 The political approach that has been prevalent in the sixth century BC to the 20th century, almost before the Second World War, is called 'traditional political approach' in terms of study facility
 ise adarshavaadi yaa shastreey drushtikon bhi kaha jaataa he
 Many political thinkers have contributed to the formulation and development of traditional political theory such as Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Saint Augustine, Aquinas, Locke, Rousseau, Montescue, Kant, Heigl, Green, etc
 aadhunik yug main bhi anek vidwaan paramparaagat drushtikon ke samarthak maane jate he jaise- liyo strans, erik vogolin, oksot, hanna arent aadi
 In ancient Greece and Rome, the concepts of philosophy, ethics, logic, history and law were made the basis for the creation of political theory, but in the medieval period, mainly Christian theological perspectives were made the basis of political theory
 16veen sadi main punarjagran aandolan ne bauddhik raajnneetik chetana ko janm diya saath hi raashtra-rajya avadharana ko janm diya
 The Industrial Revolution of the 18th century gave a new impetus to the development of political theory
 england kii gauravpurn kranti, france va america kii loktantric krantiyon ne paramparaagat raajnneetik siddhanth kaa vikaas ’udaaravaadi loktantric raajnneetik siddhant’ ke rup main kiya
 The traditional political approach has adopted philosophical, logical, moral, historical and legal methods mainly for the formulation of political theory
 19veen sadi se isane vidhik, sanvaidhanik, sansthagat, vivarnaatmak evam tulanaatmak paddatiyon par vishesh bal diya he
 From the beginning of the 20th century, the traditional approach adopted a new vision for the formulation of political theory which was more realistic than in the past
 paramparaagat raajnneetik vigyaan main sarkaar evam uske vaidhanik angon ke baahar vyavhaar main sarkaar kii nitiyon evam nirnyon ko prabhavit karne vaale saamaajik raajnneetik tathyon ke adhyayan par bal diya
 The political party emphasized the study of formal organizations, along with the groups of evidences
 isane un saamaajik, aarthik paristhitiyon evam aandolanon ke adhyayan par bhi bal diya jo spashtatah sarkaar ke aupchaarik sanghathan se baahar to hote hai kintu uski nitiyon evam kaaryakramon ko prabhavit karte hai
 The synonym of 'politics' is the English word 'politics' from the Greek word 'polis' which means 'city' or 'state'
 pracheen yunaan main prayek nagar ek swatantra rajya ke rup main sangathit hota tha or politics shabd se un nagar rajyon se sambandhit shashan kii vidya kaa bodh hota tha
 Gradually, the city states were replaced by the national states, so politics also became a widely related discipline of the state
 aadhunik yug main jab sansar prayek vishay ke vaigyanik va vyavasthit adhyayan kii ore jhuk rahaa he, rajya se sambandhit vishyon kaa adhyayan raajnneeti shaastra athwa raajnneeti vigyaan kaha jaataa he
 Traditional political science scholars have given different definitions of political science
 in paribhaashaon kii nimnaankit sheershakon ke antargat vyakhya kii ja sakati haih- Political science is the study of the state - Many political scientists believe that since ancient times, political science is the subject of the study of an institution called the state
 vidwaanon kii manyata he ki pracheen kaal se aadhunik kaal tak raajnneeti vigyaan kaa ’kendriya tatv’ rajya hi rahaa he
 Therefore, the state should be studied only in political science
 prasiddh raajnneetishastri bluenshali ke anusaar raajnneeti shaastra vah vigyaan he jiskaa sambandh rajya se he or jo yah samajhane kaa praytn karata he ki rajya ke aadharbhoot tatv kya he, uskaa aavashyak swaroop kya he, uski kin-kin vividh roopon main abhivyakti hoti he tathaa uskaa vikaas kaise hua
 The German writer Garris states that in political science, as an institution of power, all the relations of the state, its origin, its tangible form, its purpose, its moral importance, its economic problems, its stages of existence, its financial aspects, The purpose is considered
 doctor garnor ke anusaar ’’raajnneeti shaastra kaa prarambh tathaa ant rajya ke saath hota he
 "dr
 Zakaria states that" Political science systematically represents the basic principles according to which the organization of the state in the macro form and sovereignty is exercised
 ’ It is clear from all the above definitions that the central subject of political science is the state
 iskaa kaaran plato va arestu ke samay se chali aa rahi yah manyata he ki rajya kaa astitv kuch pavitra lakshyon kii prapti ke liye he
 Political science is the study of government - in the opinion of some political scientists, government should be studied in political science, not the state
 unka mat he ki rajya manushyon kaa hi sanghathan vishesh he tathaa uski kriyaatmak abhivyakti sarkaar ke madhyam se hoti he
 He argues that the state is an intangible structure whereas the government is a tangible and direct institution and the government exercises sovereignty
 sarkaar hi rajya kaa vah yantra hota he jiske dwaara uske uddeshy tathaa prayojan kaaryrup main parinit hote hai
 Therefore, government should study only in political science
 seale ke anusaar ’’raajnneeti vigyaan shashan ke tatwon kaa anusandhan usee prakaar karata he jaise sampatti shaastra sampatti kaa, jeevigyaan jivan kaa, ankaganit ankon kaa tathaa rekhganit sthaan evam lambaai-chaudaai kaa karata he
 "leacock has given a concise and concise definition in this context -" Political science is the scripture related to government
 ’’ Political science is the study of both the state and the government - some scholars of traditional political science believe that the definitions given from the point of view of the state or government alone are incomplete
 vastutah rajya evam sarkaar kaa paraspar ghanishtha sambandh he or inamen se kisi ek ke abhaav main duusare kaa adhyayan hi nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 If the state is an intangible structure, then the government gives it a tangible and physical form and similarly if the state is to hold sovereignty then the government consumes that sovereignty
 atah raajnneeti vigyaan ke antargat in donon kaa hi adhyayan kiya janaa chaiye
 According to Paul Janet, "political science is that part of social sciences in which the basis of the state and the principles of government are considered
 ’’ dymock ke anusaar raajnneeti vigyaan kaa sambandh rajya tathaa uske saadhan sarkaar se he
 While giving a short definition, Gilchrist has said that "political science studies the common problems of the state and the government
" ’’ Political science is the study in terms of the human element - some political scientists do not consider the above definitions to be absolute because the human element is ignored in these definitions
 inaki manyata he ki rajya yaa sarkaar kaa adhyayan bina maanav ke uddeshyheen evam mahatvaheen he kyonki inkaa nirmaan maanav ke hit ke liye hi hua he atah maanav-tatv kaa adhyayan anivaary he
 According to Professor Laski, "the study of political science is related to the life of human beings belonging to organized states
" ’’ raajnneeti shaastra ke prasang main maanav tatv kaa mahatv vyakt karte huye encychlopedia of soshal sinsej main harman hiler ne to yahan tak kaha he ki ’’raajnneeti shaastra ke sarvangin swaroop kaa nirdhaaran uski manushya vishyak moulik manyataon dwaara hota he
 "it literally means that political science is such a social science under which the fact is also studied what is the position of man himself in an organized political society
 raajnneeti vigyaan vyakti ke adhikaar va swatantrataaon ke adhyayan ke saath samaaj ke vibhinn samudaayon va virgon ke prati sarkaar kii nitiyon kaa bhi adhyayan karata he
 Therefore, we can define political science as a scripture which is related to its organization called state and which includes a detailed study of government by nature, in short, under political science state, government and other related organizations and institutions Ka is studied in the context of human political life
 raajnneeti vigyaan se sambandhit paramparaagat paribhaashayen nimna pravritiyaan ingit karti he- Just as political science has been defined by different thinkers in different ways, different fields have been expressed by different authors in different words
 udaahranarth francisi vichaarak bluenshali ke anusaar ’’raajnneeti vigyaan kaa sambandh rajya ke aadhaaron se he vah uski aavashyak prakruti, uske vividh roopon, uski abhivyakti tathaa uske vikaas kaa adhyayan karata he
 "according to Dr
 Garner," its fundamental problems usually include the research of the origin and nature of the first state, the progress of the second political institutions, the study of its history and its forms, and the third, as far as possible, on the basis of political And determining the rules of development
 gaetel ne raajnneeti shaastra ke kshetra kaa vistrut varnan kartehuye likhaa he ki ‘‘aitihaasik drushti se raajnneeti shaastra rajya kii utpatti, raajnneetik sansthaaon ke vikaas tathaa ateet ke siddhanton kaa adhyayan karata he
 


 In studying the present, it tries to describe, compare and classify the existing political institutions and ideologies
 parivartansheel paristhitiyon tathaa naitik maapdandon ke aadhaar par raajnneetik sansthaaon tathaa kriyakalapon ko adhik unnat banane ke uddheshy se raajnneeti shaastra bhavishya kii ore bhi dekhtaa hua yah bhi vichaar karata he ki rajya kaisaa hona chaiye
 '' raajnneeti shaastra ke kshetra ke vishay main uparokt paribhaashaon se teen vichaardhaaraen saamne aati he- To determine the field of traditional political science, UNESCO organized a conference of leading political scientists of the world in September 1948, in which it was decided to include the following study topics under the field of traditional political science- raajnneeti ke siddhanth- ateet or vartmaan ke raajnneetik siddhanton evam vichaaron kaa adhyayan
 Political Institutions - Simple and comparative study of constitution, national government, territorial and local governance
 raajnneetik dal, samooh evam lokmat- raajnneetik dal evam dabaab samoohon kaa raajnneetik vyavhaar, lokmat tathaa shashan main nagarikon ke bhaag lene kii prakriya kaa adhyayan
 International Relations - Study of International Politics, International Law, International Organization and International Administration
 paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan darshan evam kalpana par aadhaarit he
 Traditionalist thinkers have mostly been influenced by philosophy
 in vichaarkon ne maanviya jivan ke mulyon par dhyaan diya hai
 Their system of thinking is deductive
 paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan main plato kaa vishesh mahatv he
 In addition to Plato, the thought of the Roman thinker Cicero and Saint Augustine in the medieval period gives a clear glimpse of traditional political science
 aadhunik yug main paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan ke prabal samarthako kii kaaphi sankhya he
 The compositions of Russo, Kant, Hegel, Green, Bossanke, Laski, Oakshott and Leostras have a clear glimpse into Plato's ideas
 aadhunik kaal main paramparaagat raajnneeti vigyaan kii adhyayan saamagree evam rajya sambandhi dharanon kii katu aalochana hui he
 According to critics, some processes and an environment are seen beyond the periphery of the state and political institutions, neglecting the study of which is disastrous for the dignity and utility of political science
 is mat ke prativadak yah maanate he ki sabhi samaaj vigyaanon kii prerana strot va adhyayan kaa kendra bindu maanav-vyavhaar he or raajnneeti vigyaan saamanytah maanav vyavhaar ke raajnneetik pahalu kaa adhyayan he
 Prior to the Second World War, certain political thinkers were insistent on giving a major place to the political processes and activities of human beings in the study of political science
 balter vaijahot, woodro wilson, lard brice aadi ne raajnneeti ke yathartwaadee adhyayan par bal diya
 Graham Wallas, Arthur Bentley, Caitlin and Lasvalle emphasized the study of humans and their behavior
 charles marium ne 1925 kii amareeki raajnneeti vigyaan eshosiation ke sammelan main raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan ke liye vaigyanik takneekon evam pravidhiyon ke vikaas evam prayog par bal diya
 In 1930 Laswell, in his book psycho-pathology and Politics, laid the foundation for Fried's psychology to explain political events and actions
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke purv america kaa chicago vishvavidhyalay vyavahaaravaadi raajnneeti vigyaan kaa kaaryakshetra ban chukaa tha
 The development of the Second World War has special significance in the development process from traditional political science to modern political science, after which the world was very different from the former world in terms of political structure, industrial development, scientific and technological achievements and military capability
 vishwastar par huye is gambhir parivartan ne maanav samaaj va samskruti kii paramparaagat avadharanaon ke sthaan par nai avadharanaon ko janm diya
 In this environment after the Second World War, Charles Mariam fully supported the use of new and scientific techniques for the study of political science in his work 'new Aspect of Politics'
 uparokt prishthbhumi main 1960 ke dashak main america ke chicago vishvavidhyalay ke raajnneetishastriyon ne raajnneeti vigyaan ko darshanik paddati se mukt karne evam uske adhyayan ko adhik se adhik vaigyanik banane kaa praytn kiya
 It is considered appropriate to adopt the scientific methods of social sciences such as sociology, psychology, economics, anthropology, to make political science a social science
 in vaigyanikon main david easton, ketalin, lasvail aadi pramukh he
 George Caitlin, David Easton, Harald Lasvall and Kaplan are particularly notable in terms of modern concepts of political science
 in vidwaanon ne raajnneeti vigyaan sambandhi apane kathyon main raajnneeti ke vaastavik evam vyaavhaarik sandarbhon par bal dete huye use shakti, prabhaav, raajnneetik auchity evam satta kaa adhyayan mana he
 The ideas about political science presented by political scientists who are advocates of the modern approach can be explained under the following points- raajnneeti vigyaan maanav kriyaaon kaa adhyayan he- raajnneeti vigyaan ke aadhunik drushtikon ke anusaar raajnneeti vigyaan maanav ke raajnneetik vyavhaar evam kriyaaon kaa adhyayan karata he
 Non-political factors also influence human behavior
 in sabhi karkon kaa raajnneeti vigyaan main adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 a
 Heard and S
 Huntington's statement that "political pragmatism accepts governance as a process of actions for humans and their communities
" hasjaar va stivension kaa yah vichaar he ki ’’raajnneeti vigyaan apane adhyayan kshetra main praathmik rup main vyaktiyon ke parsparik va samuhik tathaa rajya evam rajyon ke madhya prakat shakti sambandhon se sambandhit he
 Political science is the study of power - Caitlin and Lasvalle are supporters of this idea
 donon ke vivechan kaa mukhya aadhaar manovigyaan he
 In 1927–28, Caitlin emphasized the study of the political activity of man in place of state, describing politics as a struggle for dominance and control
 uske matanusaar sangharsh kaa mul strot maanav kii yah ichha rahi he ki duusare log uskaa astitv maane
 In 1962, Caitlin wrote in her book Systematic Politics - Political science is the most concerned about the work that is done due to the sense of control and the structure and desires that are created due to the desires of relationships based on the feeling of control
 anya shaktivaadee vichaarak lasvail kii manyata he ki samaaj main katipay mulyon va moolyawaan vyaktiyon kii prapti ke liye har vyakti apana prabhaav daalane kii cheshtaa karata hai tathaa prabhavacheshtaa main shakti bhav nihit rahata he
 Therefore, according to Laswell, 'politics is the politics that is intended to tell who gets what, what, when and how
 ' uske anusaar raajnneetik kriyalap kaa prarambh us paristhiti se hota he jisamen karta vibhinn mulyon kii prapti ke liye praytn karata he tathaa shakti jisaki aavashyak shart hoti he
 Political science is the study of the polities - the supporters of this view are David Easton, Amand, R
V
 Kegan etc
 yah drushtikon raajnneeti vigyaan ko samajashastreey drushtikon main paribhaashit karata hai
 They believe that the whole society is a system in itself and the state system is a sub-system of this entire social system and it forms an integral part of it
 rajya vyavastha main anek kriyasheel sanrachanaae hoti hai jaise samvidhan sarkaar ke ang, raajnneetik dal, dabaab samooh, lokmat evam nirvachan evam maanav-vyavvhaar is vyavastha kaa abhinn bhaag he
 In short, these scholars believe that political science studies the interactions and relations of these structures of the political system and the political behavior of human beings as part of the entire social system
 raajnneeti vigyaan rajvyavastha ke adhyayan ke antargat nimna tathyon par adhik bal detaa he -sampurna samaaj vyavastha ke ang ke rup main raajnneetik prakriya kaa adhyayan, vyavastha kisanrachana evam samoohon ke parsparik sambandhon kaa adhyayan
 Political science is the study of decision process - Political scientists who are supportive of this view believe that while studying government, political science also studies the decision-making process of government or science in the context of the prevailing conditions in society or state
 is kaaran raajnneeti vigyaan aisa vigyaan he jo kisi shashan kii niti-prakriya evam uske dwaara niti nirmaan kaa adhyayan karata he visheshkar in donon ko prabhavit karne vaale karkon ke sandarbh main, is drushtikon kii manyata he ki maanav prakruti ke sandarbh main sarkaar dwaara niti nirmaan-prakriya kaa kaa adhyayan kiya janaa chahie
 In real political life, the decision making in the name of governance is done by the individual himself and hence the decision making process has a wide influence on the decision makers personality, interest culture, religion, political ideology, mental level decision making power etc
 atah yah kaha ja saktaa he ki aadhunik drushtikon ke anusaar raajnneeti vigyaan manushya ke saamaajik raajnneetik jivan kaa adhyayan karata he
 Under this, along with political processes, political organizations are also studied
 pinok evam smith ke anusaar kya he tathaa kya hona chaiye or in donon ke bich yathasambhav samanvay kaise praapt kiya jaye, is drushti se ham sarkaar tathaa raajnneetik prakriya ke vyavasthit adhyayan ko raajnneeti vigyaan kehete he
 The field of political science is highly developed in the modern era
 shakti va prabhaav ke sandarbh main raajnneeti kii sarvavyaapaktaa ne use har taraf pahunchaa diya he or na keval saamaajik balki vyakgit jivan ke bhi lagbhag sabhi paksh raajnneetik vyavastha ke adheen he
 While the ubiquity of politics has proved the folk religion of political interpretations on the one hand, it has also created ambiguity and confusion regarding what is political
 iske baavjood raajnneetik vigyaan ke kshetra ko rajyapradhan va rajetar sandarbhon main bhaleebhanti samajha ja saktaa he
 In the state context, political concepts and concepts related to the state's concepts - socialism, democracy etc
, government or organization constitution described and actual behavior, mutual relations of government positions and institutions, organizational and experimental aspects of election, administrative and judiciary and interpretation of the state, Principles of origin, state functionality, state-wide ideologies Freedom, equality, rights etc
 rajettar sandarbh main raajnneeti kii prakriyaatmak vaastaviktaa, raajnneeti vyavastha ke vibhinn drushtikon, rajettar sansthaae jaise raajnneetik dal, dabaav va hit samooh, gaiyr rajya-prakriyaaye va unka vistaar, anterrashtriya raajnneetik vaastaviktaae tathaa jatiltaaye ityadi aati hai
 The principles and methods of representation can also be understood in this context
 raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan kshetra ke bare main aadhunik drushtikon kii kuch aadharbhoot manyataain hai jaise- adhyayan kshetra ke nirdhaaran main yatharthparak drushtikon apnaanaa, raajnneetik vigyaan kii vishay vastu ko antar-anushaasanamak drushtikon ke antargat samajha jaye, raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan main vaigyanik paddati va upagamon ko prayog main laayaa jaye
 According to the modern view, the area of political science can be explained under the following points: maanav ke raajnneetik vyavhaar kaa adhyayan- aadhunik drushtikon maanav ke raajnneetik vyavhaar ke adhyayan par bal detaa he
 Although it affects the human behavior but also studies the non-political elements, it is recognized that to understand human behavior in real terms, the study of all the non-political feelings, beliefs and powers should be included which can affect the political behavior of human beings
 Affect vibhinn avadharanaon kaa adhyayan - aadhunik raajnneeti vigyaan mukhyatah shakti, prabhaav, satta, niyantran, nirnay prakriya aadi kaa vaigyanik adhyayan karata he
 According to this view, these are concepts whose political institutions work in the background only
 raajnneetishastri inhen avadharanaon ke pariprekshya main raajnneetik sansthaaon kaa adhyayan karte he
 For this reason, this type of study has been called informal study of the truth
 raajnneeti vigyaan samasyaon evam sangharshon kaa adhyayan - aadhunik raajnneetishastri yatha professor daayak evam peter orgard raajnneeti shaastra ko saarvajanik samasyaon va sangharshon kaa adhyayan kshetra main shaamil karte he
 In their opinion, tension and politics start due to problems of their distribution due to limited values and means
 vah raajnneetik dalon ke atirikt vibhinn vyaktiyon va samoohon main tak main fail jaati hai
 Professor Dyck called politics the politics of conflict of characters with conflicting desires over public problems
 peter origuard kii manyata he ki is sangharsh main raajnneeti ke alaava anya bahyatatvon kaa niyantran nahin hona chaiye
 Study of Public Consent and General Opinion - In the opinion of some scholars, political science is the study of consensus and general opinion on public problems
 unke vichaar main sangharsh sangharsh ke liye hi nahin varan saamaanya sahmati va saamaanya abhimath ko prabhavit karne ke liye hota he
 That is why Edward Weinfield has said that 'activities that make any issue conflict or resolve are part of all politics
 ’’ From the above analysis it is clear that despite the differences in the field of political science in the modern approach, there is agreement on some basics, such as everyone recognizes that the study area of political science is realistic, its study is inter-disciplinary
 Approach and scientific method should be used
 haalanki yah satya he ki aadhunik raajnneetishastriyon kaa raajnneeti vigyaan main vaigyanik pramanikta va sunishchitata kaa daawa abhi purna nahin hua he
 For this reason, Pinock and Smith, while accepting some amendments in the modern approach, have said to give proper place to the study of political politics as well as the organizational and fundamental study of political institutions
 arastu ke anusaar manushya ek saamaajik praani he
 All the dimensions of social life fulfill his lifestyle
 maanak jivan kii dhuree par in ayaamon ke sabhi niamak vishay paraspar judakar satat parichaalit he
 Politics does the important work of coordinating all these dimensions
 raajnneeti vigyaan evam anya saamaajik vigyaanon kii ghanishthata ke kaaran hi raajnneeti vigyaan ke adhyayan main pracheen kaal se antar-anushaasanamak adhyayan kii parampara rahi he
 In the works of ancient Greek thinker Plato, Aristotle, the intimacy of politics is evident from philosophy and ethics
 madhyayugin vichaarak saint augustin va thomas equinas kii rachanaaon main dharamshastra va nitishastra ke saath raajnneeti kii ghanishthata prakat hoti he
 Maciavali, the early 16th century scholar of the modern era, used history in its ideological basis
 uske baad habs ne jyamiti, yantriki tathaa chikitsavigyaan ke tathyon va siddhanton kaa upyog kiya
 Rousseau and Montescue explained the closeness of politics and geography
 18veen sadi ke uttararddh va 19veen sadi ke praarambhik kaal main raajnneeti vigyaan va anya samaaj vigyaanon ke bich ghanishtha sambandh swikaarne main baadha aayi kyonki is kaal main vibhinn vigyaanon dwaara apane ko purna evam swatantra vigyaan maanane par bal diya gaya
 But from the middle of the 19th century, again the fact began to be accepted that all social sciences have close relations
 karl marks evam august kamte ne saamaajik vigyaanon kii ghanishthata par bal diya
 With the beginning of the 20th century, political science's intimacy with other sciences was often unquestionably accepted
 vyavahaarwad evam uttar-vyavahaarwad ne antar-anushaasanamak adhyayan kii anivaaryta ko sthapit kiya
 American political scientists, especially the Chicago School of Political Science, have contributed to this development

 Adi cemented inter-disciplinary studies based on empirical evidence
 paul jenet ne likhaa he- The summary is that there is mutual interdependence in sociology
 koi bhi ek samaaj vigyaan samaajakaa uchit evam samgr adhyayan nahin kar saktaa
 Therefore, all sociology are related among themselves and the method of interstructural study has again raised this relation of sociology
 aaj rajnatik arthshaastra, rajnatik naitikta, rajnatik itihaas, rajnatik samajashaastra, rajnatik manovigyaan, tathaa rajnatik bhugol aadi vibhinn raajnneeti vigyaan kii nai shakhaon kaa khulanaa is baat kaa pratik he ki raajnneeti vigyaan anya samaaj vigyaanon se sambandh sthapit kiye bina nahin chalasaktaa

 In 1896, Zeman examined the sodium flame by placing it between two poles of a strong electromagnet and discovered that both sharp yellow lines of the spectrum widened somewhat
 yadi varnakramdarshi kii vibhedan-kshamta kaafii adhik ho to chumbakeey kshetra main rakhe prakaash strot kii prayek varnakram rekha kai ghatak rekhaon main vibhajit ho jaati he
 This phenomenon is called the Zeman effect
 san 1892 main farade ne yahi prabhaav dekhne kaa asafal praytn kiya tha
 The absorbing lines divide into components when the absorber medium is placed in a magnetic field
 ise vyutkram zemaan prabhaav kehete hai
 To see the Zeeman effect, spectral lines are inspected by the addition of a device with a high differential potential, such as the Lumer – Gehrke board and the rule deviation spectrograph
 chumbakiyashetra kii abhilamb disha main nirikshan se anuprasthadrishy tathaa samaantar disha main nirikshan se anudairdhya drishy, praapt hota he
 a longitudinal view requires a groove or tunnel parallel to the magnetic field in the middle of a pole of the magnet
 lorents ne apane dravya or vikiran ke electron siddhant ke aadhaar par isaki vyakhya kii or yah bhavishyavaanee ko ki ye varnakram rekhaayen chumbakeey kshetra dwaara dhruvit ho jaani chahie
 In longitudinal view these lines should have circular polarization and transverse angle should have linear polarization
 in bhavishyavaaniyon kaa zemaan ne satyaapan kiya
 Lorents showed by his theory that when looking at the spectral line of light perpendicular to the magnetic field, three component lines should be visible
 zemaan prabhaav main jab uparyukt visthaapan par keval teen ghatak rekhaayen dekhin jaayan, use prakrut zemaan prabhaav kehete hai tathaa un ghatak rekhaon ke namoonay kaa prakrut trik yaa lorents trik kehete hai
 But when a spectral line divides into many more component lines, it is called the unaudited Zeeman effect, because it cannot be interpreted on the basis of the iconic principle
 prakrut zemaan trik vishesh rup he or ekak shrenee kii varnakram rekhaon dwaara pradarshit kiya jaataa he, jabaki praarambhik or antim urja dasha kaa lande gunank ek ke baraabar hota he
 Ordinary Lorents were seen in the spectrum of tri-zinc and cadmium, and the measurement of their frequencies, and the magnitude of e / m by the above formula, was found to be equal to the e / m ejected by the negative rays
 yah parinaam aikya tathaa anudairdhyadrishy main vrittiya dhruvan ke ghumaav kii prekshit disha, is baat kaa pramaan hai ki parmanviya varnakram main vikiran chalyman rinatmak vidyut aavesh dwaara nikalataa he
 Preston established by using devices with greater deflection and differentiation capability that the sample of ground-component-lines of a specific range of the same spectral lines was of the same type and characterized by that category
 is prakaar zemaan prabhaav varnakram vishleshan kaa vishisht saadhan ban gaya
 In 1907 Rouge showed that the displacement of the component lines of unmodified Zemann samples can be manifested as the displacement product of the natural triplet lines
 udaahranarth ke p or s ghatakon kaa visthaapan or lorents ikaiyaan hoga
 For this it will be displacement Lorents units

 This effect was noticed by Paschon and Beck in 1912 and found that in a much more intense magnet field, the natural Zeman component sample turns to the natural Zeman component sample natural Zeman triad
 isi liye zemaan prabhaav varnakram vishleshan or parmaanuon or yanon kii electron rachana kaa pataa lagane kaa mukhya saadhan he

 Kuldhara or Kuldhar is a cursed and mysterious village located in the Jaisalmer district of the Indian state of Rajasthan, which is also known as the village of ghosts
 is gaanv kaa nirmaan lagbhag 13veen shatabdi main paliwal brahmanon ne kiya tha
 But the entire village was destroyed in the 19th century due to dwindling water supply, but according to some legends, the village was destroyed by Jaisalmer Minister of State Salim Singh
 saleem singh jo jaisalmer ke ek mantri hua karte the wo gaanv par kaaphi shakhti se pesh aata tha is kaaran sabhi gramvasi log pareshaan hokar ratorat gaanv chhodkar chale gaye saath hi shraap bhi dekar chale gaye is kaaran yah shaapit gaanv bhi kehalaata he
 This village is still called a ghostly village, but now the Rajasthan government has given it the status of a tourist destination, due to this, thousands of tourists are coming here everyday from home and abroad

 Kuldhara village - a symbol of the wrath of Brahmins where people are still afraid to go
 rajasthan ke jaisalmer shahar se 18 kimi dur sthit kuldhara gaav aaj se 500 saal pehle 600 gharo or 85 gaavo kaa paliwal brahmino kaa samrajya aisa rajya tha jisaki kalpana bhi nahin kii ja sakati he,registan ke banjar dhoro main pani nahin miltaa vahaan paliwal brahmino ne aisa chamatkaar kiya jo insaani dimag se bahut pare thi,unhone jameen pe uplabdh pani kaa prayog nahin kiya,na barish ke pani ko sangrahit kiya balki registan ke mitti main mojood pani ke kan ko khoja or apana gaav jipsom kii sataha ke upar banaaya,unhone us samay jipsom kii jameen khoji taaki barish kaa pani jameen sokhe nahin,or aawaaj ke liye gaav aisa bansaaya kii dur se agar dushman aaye to uski aawaaj usase 4 guna pehle gaav ke bheetar aa jaati thi
 There was such a combination of voice in the middle of every house, as in today's time there are telephones, the Diwan and Raja of Jaisalmer did not understand that Brahmins could live their lives by farming in such a modern way, so they imposed tax on farming
 Diya but Paliwal Brahmino refused to pay taxes, after that Diwan Salim Singh liked the daughter of the head of the village, then he said either give the daughter to the Diwan or decide to face the punishment It was not bad for Brahmino to understand his self-esteem, so one night, a sage of 85 villages would sit and decide that he would leave the Kuldhara in the night, and how the villagers of 85 villages were called and when did this thing go Did not know till date par jate jate paliwal brahman shaap de gaye kii ye kuldhara hamesa viraan rahegaa is jameen pe koi phir se aake nahin bas paayegaa, Even today, the temperature in Jaisalmer, whether it is summer or winter, the temperature rises by 4 degrees as soon as the Kuldhara village arrives
 When the team of scientists reached their machines, there was a recording of voice and noise in their machines, which shows that the Kuldhara i still have some power in the village, which does not allow anyone to live in this village
 The record wave in the machine says that there is some indication of the power there, even today, like the village of Kuldhara Ma comes to the mobile network and the radio stops reducing, but as soon as the mobile and radio start coming out of the village limits, aaj bhi kuldhara shaam hote hi khaali ho jaataa he or koi insaan vahaan jane kii himmat nahin karata
jaisalmer jab bhi janaa ho to kuldhara zarur jaae
brahman ke krodh or atmasamman kaa pratik he, kuldhara
 Kuldhara village was originally inhabited by the Brahmin displaced Jaisalmer from Pali
 paali mul ke in logon ko paliwal kaha jaataa he
 According to the 1899 history book tawarikh-e-jaisalmer composed by Lakshmi Chand, a Paliwal Brahmin named Kadhan was the first to settle in Kuldhara village
 unhone gaanv main udhansar naamak ek talab khoda
 There are 3 cremation grounds along with various deities among the ruins of the village
 devli shilalekhon ke anusaar, gaanv kii sthapana 13veen sadi ke purvarddh main hui
 These inscriptions are dated in the Bhattik Samvat and are dated 1235 AD and 1238 AD respectively as the demise of two residents
 gaanv main ab 400 khandahar ghar dekhe ja sakate he, jisamen ab vartmaan main koi nahin rahata he kintu kinvadantiyon ke anusaar yahan bhoot rahete he
 The history book tawarikh-e-jaisalmer, written by Lakshmi Chand, states that the Paliwal Brahmin caste lived here
 jabaki kejavi ke mutabik yahan 17veen 18 veen shatabdi main kuldhara gaanv main takreeban 1588 log rahete the
 According to a British official, James Tod, in 1815, the population was only 800, in which there were 200 families
 vahaan kaaphi anya devaali abhilekh hai
 These inscriptions do not refer to the word Paliwali
 ye abhilekh yahan ke nivaasiyon ko brahman bataaya hai
 Many inscriptions refer to these residents as Kuldhar or Kaldhar caste
 aisa prathit hota hai ki paliwal brahmanon main kuldhar ek jati samooh tha, or inhen ke naam par gaanv kaa naam padaa
 Some inscriptions also refer to the caste and gotra of these inhabitants
 anya jatiyaan jinka abhilekh main ullekh hai, wein hai - harajal, harajalu, harajaluni, mughadal, jisutiya, loharthi, lahathi, lakhar, sahaaran, jag, calsar or mahajalar
 The gotras that are mentioned are Asmar, Sutdhana, Gargavi, and Gago
 ek abhilekh gonaali ke rup main ek brahman ke kul kaa ullekh karata hai
 Apart from the Paliwal Brahmin, an inscription mentions two sutradhars named Dhanmag and Sujo Gopalana
 ye abhilekh darshaate hai ki, brahman nivasee brahman samaaj main hi shaadi karte the, jabaki jatiyaan duusare gotra main vivaah karti thi
 The people of Kuldhara village belonged to Vaishnavism
 is gaanv kaa mukhya mandir vishnu bhagwaan or mahisasur mardini kaa he
 However, most of the idols are also of Ganesh ji which is displayed at the entrance
 gaanv ke log vishnu ,mahisasur mardini or ganesh ji ke alaava bail or sthaneey ghode par savaar devtaa kii bhi puja karte the
 People in Kuldhara village in which male people wore Mugliya-style turban or safaa while pajamas were also worn as well as tied waistband on the waist
 inke alaava kandhe par angarkha bhi rakhte the
 Men used to wear necklaces in addition to all these
 mahilaayein mukhyatah lehange pahenti thi jabaki angarkha ye mahilaayein bhi rakhti thi, saath hi gale main kuch haar bhi pahana karti thi
 The people of Kuldhara village mostly used to do the business of agriculture, the work of bankers and farmers, as well as making pottery, they used ornate utensils, which were made
 ve jalasanchay ke liye khadin kaa istemaal karte the jo ek kritrim nichaai vaala hissaa hota tha jiske teen ore band bana diye jate the
 When the water of the Khadin dried up, the soil left behind would have been favorable for the sorghum, wheat and gram crops
 ek 2
5 kilometre lambii or 2 kilometre chaudee khadin kuldhara ke dakshin disha main maujuud thi
 The villagers used to irrigate the Kakani river or the Kakani river and some wells for watering
 kakani nadi jo shakhaon main vibhajit thim ,ek jise "masuradi nadi" kaha jaataa tha ,or duusari jo ki ek naalee ke rup main thi
 Kakani river, which is a seasonal river, when it dried up, the people of the village used to bring water from wells built away from homes
 ek stambh shilaalekh se pataa chalata he ki gaanv main tejpal naam kaa ek brahman hua karata tha, jisane ek baavdi kaa nirmaan karavaaya tha
 This Brahmin was a resident of Kuldhara village
 jo gaanv itnaa viksit tha to phir kya vajah rahi ki wo gaanv raaton raat viraan ho gaya
 The reason for this was Ayyav Diwan Salam Singh from the village whose dirty eyes had fallen on a beautiful girl in the village
 dewan us ladki ke peeche is kadar pagal tha ki bas kisi tarah se use paa lenaa chahta tha
 He started pressuring the Brahmins for this
 had to tab ho gai ki jab satta ke mad main chur us dewan ne ladki ke ghar sandesh bhijwaya ki yadi agle poornamasi tak use ladki nahin mili to vah gaanv par hamalaa karke ladki ko uthaa le jayega
 It was a difficult time for the villagers
 unhen yaa to gaanv bachaana tha yaa phir apni beti
 All 84 villagers gathered at a temple to decide on this subject and the panchayats decided that whatever happens, they would not give their girl to that diwan
 phir kya tha, gaanv waalon ne gaanv khaali karne kaa nirnay kar liya or ratorat sabhi 84 gaanv ankhon se ojhal ho gaye
 While going he cursed that after today no one will be able to settle in these houses
 aaj bhi vahaan kii haalat waisi hi he jaisi us raat thi jab log ise chhod kar gaye the
 Some people believe that people did not leave the village here due to water problem but because of the atrocities of Jaisalmer State Minister Salim Singh
 kinvadantiyon ke anusaar yahaan par kaaphi sankhya main log rahaa karte the jisamen ek mukhiya bhi hua karata tha ,mukhiya kii ek sundar putree bhi thi yah baat kuldhara gaanv se baahar nikali or jaisalmer rajya tak pahunchi
 When Salim Singh came to know about this, he became fascinated by that beautiful girl, so he started putting pressure on the villagers
 saleem singh chahta tha ki vah mukhiya kii putree se shaadi kare lekin gaanv vaale katai nahin chaahate the brahman samaaj kaa naam chota pade
 For this reason, the village head called a meeting one night and everyone decided that we will leave this village overnight and otherwise it will marry the girl of the village
 phir ek raat sabhi gaanvvaale puraa gaanv ko chhodkar kisi duusare gaanv main chale gaye
 People say that these villagers used to go and go with the curse that no one will be able to settle here, so currently this village of Jaisalmer in Rajasthan is called a cursed village
 purv main is gaanv main ghoomane jane ke liye ke anumati nahin thi ,kyonki is gaanv ko bhutiya gaanv kaha jaataa he logon ke anusaar yahaan bhoot rahete he
 But now the Rajasthan government has claimed that there are no ghosts living here, so it has been opened to everyone and has been given the status of tourist destination
 is kaaran ab yahaan hazaron kii sankhya main log ghoomane aate he
 Here not only the local people come from the country but also from abroad
