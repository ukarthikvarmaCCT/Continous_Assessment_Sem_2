 acharya hajariprasad dvivedi ke anusaar sanskrit main bhi niabandh kaa sahitya he
 Theological theories were logically interpreted in those essays of ancient Sanskrit literature
 unamem vyaktitv kii visheshta nahin hoti thi
 But the essays of the present day are exactly opposite from the Sanskrit essays
 unamem vyaktitv yaa vaiyaktikta kaa gun sarvapradhan he
 Freedom from the stereotypes of history-perception tradition
 niabandh kii vidha kaa sambandh isi itihaas-bodh se he
 This is why the main feature of the essay is the publication of personality
 niabandh kii sabase acchhee paribhaasha he- There is an overarching flaw in this definition
 lekin niabandh kaa rup sahitya kii anya vidhaon kii apeksha itnaa swatantra he ki uski sateek paribhaasha karnaa atyant kathin he
 Essay in the languages of the whole world has been recognized as the creative mode of literature in the modern era itself
 aadhunik yug main hi madhyayugin dharmik, saamaajik roodhiyon se mukti kaa dwaar dikhaai padaa he
 The essay has a deep connection with this liberation
 hajariprasad dvivedi ke anusaar- Thus the essayist has a special importance in the essay
 acharya ramchandra shukla ne likhaa he: This means that no concrete structure-rules and elements can be instructed in an essay which is necessary for the essayist to follow
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki niabandh ek aisi kalakriti he jiske niyam lekhak dwaara hi avishkrut hote hai
 In the essay, there is an expression of personality in a simple, simple and austere manner
 'hindi sahitya kosh' ke anusaar: Thus the essay has two special qualities- niabandh kaa aarambh kaise ho, bich main kya ho or ant kis prakaar kiya jaae, aise kisi nirdesh or niyam ko maanane ke liye nibandhkaar baadhya nahin he
 But this does not mean that the essay is a disorderly creation and the essayist is a disorderly person
 nibandhkaar apni prerana or vishay vastu kii sambhaavnaaon ke anusaar apane vyaktitv kaa prakaashan or rachana kaa sanghathan karata he
 For this reason, style has special significance in the essay
 hindi sahitya ke aadhunik yug main bharatendu or unke sahyogiyon se niabandh likhane kii parampara kaa aarambh hota he
 Not only essays, many genres of prose are practiced by Bharatendu
 yah is baat kaa pramaan he ki gadhy or uski vidhaayen aadhunik manushya ke swadhin vyaktitv ke adhik anukool hai
 Freedom in broad form is the central emotion of modern man

 Occasional pressure is experienced
 bhavishya kii sambhaavnaayen khulti jaan padati hai
 This is called historiography

 The reasons for which the equilibrium, or health, of various parts of the body are destroyed and distortions occur in them, are called causative and their science is called etiology
 ye kaaran anek hai
 They are divided into the following parts: ye hetukikaarak jis prakaar se vikrutiyon ko utpann karte hai, usko rogajanan kehete hai
 The pathologies that occur in different parts of the body due to pathological causes are known as pathologies and the description of the metal organ or intent with these deformities is called the deformed body and the pathology of these deformities is pathology or pathology
 vikrutivigyaan kaa mukhya uddeshy vividh rogakaarakon se vibhinn ango main jo vividh vikrutiyaan utpann hoti he, unka kaaryakaaran bhav pradarshit karnaa he
 The main purpose of pathology is to give an explanation of the gross and subtle forms of those deformities and to clarify the symptoms arising from various diseases based on them
 yah uddeshy vividh vyaadhiyon se mrit vyaktiyon ke sampurna itihaas ke saath, maranottar pareekshan se unke sharir ke vibhinn dhatvashayadi angon ke bheetar paae janevaali vikrutiyon, kaa mail kiye bina siddh nahin ho saktaa
 Post mortem for pathology was introduced in Western countries in the 16th - 17th centuries
 morgagni ne san 1761 main uske purv kiye gaye saikadon shavpareekshanon kii chaanvin kar, unamem se saat sau shavpareekshanon ke vrittant ko brihad sangrah granth ke teen bhaagon main prakashit kiya
 In this treatise, the extent to which the signs and symptoms found in various organs of patients correlate with the anatomical malformations found within their bodies
 iske pashchaat hi vikrutivigyaan ko swatantra astitv praapt hua
 Rudolph Fikhons began using the microscope in the 19th century to test for physiologic malformations and published his treatise on cellular pathology in 1846 AD
 is granth ne rogon ke swaroop kii tathaa unke abhyas ke liye koun-cone se saadhan prayukt hone chahie or prayukt ho sakate hai, inke sambandh kii kalpana main kranti paidaa kii tathaa vikruti vigyaan ko, jo pehle roganidan ke antargat ek chota sa vishay tha, nidaan kaa ek uttam adhishthan bana diya
 Despite the latent malformations in the body parts, the reaction, swelling, renovation, growth inhibition, degeneration, tumor, etc
 are some common types of Ini-guinea
 sharir ke bheetar in vikrutiyon kaa swaroop jab aasaani se indriya grahya hota he, tab usko sthool vikruti kehete hai tathaa sookshm swaroop kii vikruti hone par in vikrutiyon ko dekhne ke liye jab sookshmdarshi yantra kii aavashyaktaa hoti he tab usko sookshm vikruti kehete hai
 Deformations emphasize the heterogeneity of various body parts and their anatomical and morphological changes and their functional changes in diseases
 saransh main vikrutiyon kaa ullekh vibhinn angon se sambandhit hota he or rog kaa ullekh adhiktar lakshanon se sambandhit hota he
 The disease remains in the form of malformations in the body from long ago
 keval vah bahut sookshm hone se indriyagrahya kam hokar buddhigrahya adhik hota he
 When complete body deformities and their causes are described according to the above general types, then it is called normal pathology and when each organ, intention or institution of the body is described independently of the above types of deformities
 Is, then it is called special pathology
 prayogshaala ke andar vibhinn parikshaon se rogi ke rog kaa adhyayan clinical pathology dwaara kiya jaataa he
 General pathology is divided into the following chapters
 aadhunik vichaarak yah maanate hai ki sujan, sajiv sharirastha koshikaon ke dwaara kisi bhi kshobh ke virodh main kii gai pratikriya maatr he
 There are four reasons for the outbreak: sujan ke pramukh chihn nimnlikhit hai : Along with this, there is a loss of activity of the organ due to some shock in the tissues and due to some colic
 sharir kaa nirmaan karanevaale vibhinn utakon ke ke hraas, vinaash tathaa kshati ko saamaanya oothkakshay kehete hai
 Causes - The following are the major causes of tissue tissue saransh main oothkakshay kaa mukhya kaaran dhamni, shiraaon tathaa keshikaon main avrodh kaa hona he
 Due to this, nutritious substance does not reach the said place
 oothkakshay ke prakaar nimnlikhit hai : It is also a tissue-specific action
 jab kisi utak kaa apakarshan kaha jaataa he, to iskaa abhipraay utak main ek vishesh prakaar kaa parivartan samajhnaa chahie, jaise vasa apakarshan kehane se kisi ootkavishesh main vasa kii upasthiti he, aisa bodh hota he, usee ke anusaar namakaran bhi hota he, jaise hriday apakarshan, mansapeshiy apakarshan, yakruti apakarshan ityadi
 In other words, when there is a change in the chemical activity of the cell due to lack of nutritious diet of tissues, it is called detraction
 isamen koshika kii purnataya mrityu ho jaati he tathaa uske protoplasm se ek nae prakaar ke rasinic padaarth kii utpatti hoti hai
 This substance is completely different from the previous structure of the cell and thus the function of the cell is completely different
 jab koshika ke andar lasika main se ek vishisht padaarth nikalakar ikattha ho jaataa he, to use ant:spandan kehete hai
 This infusion is mainly adipose, calcareous and amyloid type, whereas ablation is fatty mucoid and colloid
 rakt ke abhaav se jab utak main ek prakaar kii sadan hone lagati hai, to use koth kehete hai
 It is of two types dry koth and humid
 shushk koth - jab kisi ek bhaag kii dhamni dwaara kisi ang main rakt pahunchnaa band ho jaataa he, to shushk koth kii utpatti hoti he
 Humid dictionary - In this, the movement of blood from the veins by a particular organ towards the heart stops completely
 rakt kii us sthaan par aamad hoti he, parantu nikaas nahin hota
 Apart from the above two types of coaths, there are other types of coaths as well, such as intercostal coath, infectious coath, pneumothritis, diabetes mellitus, senescent coath, and renal disease
 jeern yaa vinasht hue utak yaa koshikaon kii kriya yathasambhav pun: praapt kii jaae, is abhipraay se jo unka punarjanan hota he, vah punarnirmaan, yaa jirnoddhar kaha jaataa he
 It is such a special state of the body in which there is growth of body tissue
 saamanyat: arbud do prakaar ke hote hai : Soft tumors - These are fatal because they do not cause any harm to life
 ghaatak arbud- jin arbudon main vighatan atyadhik hota he, unamem utak kii si akruti nahin banati
 Their composition is different from that of tissue and their growth is very rapid
 ve sharir main shighratapurvak prasaarit hokar andar hi andar swasth avyavon ko aakraant karte hai
 The action of this internal transmission is called metastasis
 is kaaran ye bahut maarak bhi hote hai or isi se inhen ghaatak, dusht, yaa chand arbud kaha jaataa he
 When there is an attack of any pathogenic bacteria in the human body, then the nature inside the body resists them the most, and in this war, the body's thick cells protect the body from disease by destroying the force of those external bacteria
 sharir ke andar se utpann isi roganashak shakti ko pratiraksha kehete hai
 There are two types of immunity: swaabhaavik pratiraksha - kisi rog ke pratirodh main sharir ke andar jo swaabhaavik shakti utpann hoti he use swaabhaavik pratiraksha kehete hai
 Earned immunity - If a person does not have the resistance to a particular disease and retrospectively by himself or by any other measures, he can be called acquired immunity
 udaahranarth, haija, chechak, motitora, titains ityadi paidaa karanevaale kuch rogaanu aise chote hai jo ek baar sharir main pravesh karne par rog paidaa kar sakate hai, parantu thodi maatra main pravisht karne par rog ke prati pratiraksha shakti utpann karte hai
 The reason for this is that a toxin produces disease in the body due to excessive intake, but the same toxin creates immunity by staying in very small amounts
 thailacin aadhunik yug kaa sabase bada gyaat maansaahaari dhaniprani tha
 It is also called Tasmanian Lion due to the stripes on its back
 kuch log is tasmanian bhediya bhi bulaate hai
 It was native to the mainland of Australia, the island of Tasmania and New Guinea but is believed to have become extinct in the 20th century
 yah apane 'thailecnidaaye' naamak jeevvaigyanik kul kii aakhri jivit jati thi kyonki anya sabhi jatiyaan madhyanutan yug, yani aaj se 50 lakh varsh purv, ke ant tak pehle hi vilupt ho chuki thim
 By the time Europeans settled in the Australian mainland in the 18th and 19th centuries, Thylacine was either extinct there or on the verge of extinction
 lekin mukhyabhumi se hatakar tasmania ke dweep par yah tasmenian devil jaise anya jatiyon kii tarah jivit tha
 When the European people camped there too, government rewards were given for killing it
 dhire-dhire yah khatm hone laga
 In 1936, the last known Thylacine died in the Zoo of Hobart, the capital of Tasmania, and the species became extinct
 isaki vilupti ke kai kaaran bataaye jate hai jinamein maanvon dwaara shikaar, bimaari kaa failana, tasmania main kutton kaa aa janaa or thailacin ke junglee nivas sthanon main insaanon kaa aa dhamkna shaamil hai
 After much investigation in January 2013, scientists attributed human activities to its extinction

 The second theory is that belly dance was originally performed by women for women in the Levant and North Africa
 "dancer of shamahakaa" pustak vyapak rup se uddhrut he; yah aadhunik lekhak armen ohanian dwaara likhit ek romantic jeevani he jise 1918 main prakashit kiya gaya tha
 In Middle Eastern society two distinct belly dance antics have been used for many generations for childbirth
 kyonki beli nrity vyaktigat pradarshan se niklaa he, isaki utpatti kaa itihaas kaaphi vividh he or iskaa vikaas abhi bhi nirantar jari he
 Some point out that the belly dance originated with people migrating from all the borders around the Mediterranean Sea, resulting in similarities between the "belly dances" found in North Africa and the Middle East Huh
 beli nrity 18veen or 19veen sadiyon ke romani andolan ke dauraan pashchim main lokapriy hua tha jab orientlist kalakaaron ne osman rajvansh main haram ke jivan kii romantic tasveeron kaa chithran kiya tha
 Around this time, dancers from Middle Eastern countries began to perform at various fairs in the world, often attracting such a large number of spectators that their performers of science and technology became their antagonists
 yahi vah avadhi thi jiske dauraan "oriental" yaa "eastern" daancing shabd kaa pehali baar istemaal kiya gaya
 Many dancers were involved in "oriental" dancing, including the French writer Colette, who at times abandoned her own authentic interpretations

 Many aspects identified today as belly dance actually derive from the reciprocal hybridization of these cultures

 In the West, the costumes most commonly associated with belly dancing are bedlam

 The belt can be stitched as a separate piece or in a skirt

 Belts are rarely used if different bras and skirts are worn, and any kind of decorative embroidery is performed directly on a tight, sleek lycra skirt
 sharir ke madhya bhaag ko dhankane ke liye ek paardarshee body stocking anivaary rup se pahana jaataa he
 Egyptian dancers traditionally dance with bare feet, but nowadays shoes and even high-heeled sandals are often worn

 Skirts are translucent and / or much shorter than Egyptian costumes, showing the majority of the dancers' body

 turki kii nartakiyaan bhi bedala style ke paridhaan pahenti hai
 In the '80s and' 90s, a 'style of stripping dance' costume style was developed in which the skirts were designed to show both legs up to the hips and used a bra of shock
 is tarah kii style abhi bhi kuch sthanon main maujuud hai lekin kai aisi turki beli nartakiyaan bhi hai jo kahin adhik udaartaa se apane paridhaan pahenti hai
 Nevertheless, the costumes of many Turkish belly dances reflect the racy, romantic style of Turkish belly dance

 Most Belidans focus on producing movements from the vital muscles of the body rather than the external muscles of the body
 mistre or lebanani belidance main vishesh rup se harkaton ke peeth kii mansapeshiyon se utpann hone kii jarurat par jor diya jaataa he
 Correct posture is as important in Belidance as it is in other areas of dance

 There are three main types of traditional dance associated with belly dance in Egypt which are called by different names
 mote taur par ye lok nrity, shastreey nrity or cabre nrity hai
 The most frequently used words for these are: Sha'abi, Bailadi / Beledi and Shirki
 bailadi upari misr main based arab kabeelon se lee gayi nrity kii ek lok style he
 However, the term has been used exclusively in reference to the folk dance which is still being performed by the working classes of urban Egypt
 vah nrity jo adhik sakhti se karne ke liye gramin ilaakon yaa vishisht janajatiyon kii lok paramparaon ko banaae rakhane kii koshish karata he use aksar gavaji ke naam se sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 Gawaji dancers have also been known to be at the center of a struggle over the merits of dances to be performed publicly in Egypt
 supratishthit maajin bahanon ko gawaja nrity kaa pradarshan karne vaali antim pramanik nartkiyon ke rup main vyapak rup se janaa jaataa he
 Khairayya Mazin is currently the last name among these dancers who have been teaching and performing dance till 2009
 sharki bailadi style par aadhaarit he lekin ise samiya jamaal, taheea carioka, naeema akef or anya nartkiyon ne aage or adhik viksit kiya jinhone egyptian film udyog ke sunahare varshon ke dauraan kaaphi prasiddhi hasil kii thi
 It is considered a classical style of dance in Egypt

 The venue was a popular venue for influential musicians and choreographers from both the US and Europe who were deeply involved in the performances and careers of dancers, bringing to fame many of the golden age inventions as new advances in dance may be considered
 baad kii nartakiyaan jinhone apni shaileyon ko aanshik rup se in kalakaaron ke nrityon par aadhaarit kiya unke naam hai sohair jaki, fifi abdau or nagava fawaad
 ye sabhi nartakiyaan 1960 or 1980 ke bich mashhoor huin or aaj bhi lokapriy hai
 Many of these later dancers were the first to choreograph and perform using a complete "orchestra" and stage set up that had a major impact on the genre that is today considered a "classical" style

 Nellie Majloom and Mahmoud Reda are known to incorporate elements of ballet into belly dance and their influence can be seen in modern Egyptian dancers who are comfortable walking or walking in a circular or figure eight figure
 haalanki pashchimi nartakiyaan misr ko beli nrity kii pavitra sthali ke rup main dekhati hai, misr kii beli nartakiyaan bahut acchhee nahin maani jaati hai
 Egyptians do not consider it a respectable profession and most of the Belly dancers performing for tourists in Egypt are foreigners
 nartkiyon ko kuch khaas harkaton kaa pradarshan karne yaa kisi bhi tarah kaa floor work karne kii anumati nahin he
 National television in Egypt no longer broadcast belly dancing
 misr kii beli nartkiyon ko prashikshit karne ke liye ek rashtriya santhaan sthapit karne kii yojana kaa kaaphi virodh kiya gaya kyonki vahaan ke ek sansad sadsy, farid ismail ke anusaar yah "misr kii saamaajik paramparaon ko gambhir chunauti detii he or samvidhan kaa saafe taur par ulanghan karti hai
 " kuch log galati se yah maanate hai ki turki ke praachya nrity ko siftetali kaha jaataa he kyonki sangeet kii is style ko arabon or unaniyon dwaara praachya nrity main shaamil kiya gaya he
 In fact the Belly dance of Greece and Cyprus is called Siftetli
 haalanki, turki siftetali vastav main ek jeevant vaivaahik sangeet kaa ek rup he or yah praachya nrity ke saath judaa hua nahin he
 The Belly dance of present-day Turkey, Greek and Cyprus may have been influenced by the Arabs and Syrian / Lebanese forms more and more like the Ottoman Empire before the Arabs
 turki kaa kanoon nartkiyon par us tarah pratibandh nahin lagaataa he jaisaa ki misr main hota he, jahaan nartakiyaan apane sharir ke madhya bhaag ko dhank kar rakhti hai or floor work or kuch khaas pedu sambandhi harkaton kaa pradarshan nahin kar sakati hai

 The flag song originally written is as follows: - "vijayi vishwa tirangaa pyaara, jhandaa unchaa rahe hamaara" naamak ukt suvikhyath jhandaa geet ko 1938 ke congress adhiveshan main sweekaar kiya gaya tha
 Shyamlal Gupta, who composed this song, was a resident of Narwal in 'councilor' Kanpur
 unka janm 16 sitambar 1893 ko vaisya parivaar main hua tha
 He had a higher education even in poverty
 unamem deshbhakti kaa atoot jajba tha, jise vah praayah apni ojasvi rashtriya kavitaaon main vyakt karte the
 After being an active Congress worker, he also became the District Congress President of Fatehpur in 1923
 vah 'sachiv' naam kaa ek akhbaar bhi nikaalte the
 When it was almost decided that independence was about to be attained, the Congress had selected the country's flag
 lekin ek alag “jhandaa geet” kii jarurat mahasoos kii ja rahi thi
 Ganesh Shankar 'vidyarthi' was convinced of the poetry skills of the councilor
 vidhyaarthee ji ne parshad ji se jhandaa geet likhane kaa anurodh kiya
 Councilor kept trying for several days, but he could not write satisfactory flag song
 jab vidhyaarthiji ne parshad ji se saaf-saaf kah diya ki unhen har haal main kal subah tak "jhandaa geet" chahie, to vah raat main kaagaj-kalam lekar jam gayi
 By midnight, he had written a new song on the flag, but he did not submit it himself
 niraash ho kar raat do baje jab vah sone ke liye lete, achaanak unke bheetar naye bhav umadane lage
 He got up from bed and sat down to write a new song
 parshad ji ko laga jaise unki kalam apane aap chal rahi ho or 'bharat mata' un se vah geet likhaa rahi ho
 The song was- "the victorious world tricolor is cute, our flag is high
" " geet likh kar unhen bahut santosh mila
 As soon as morning, the councilor sent this song to 'vidyarthi' ji, which he liked very much
 jab yah geet mahatma gandhi ke paas gaya, to unhone geet ko chota karne kii salaah di
 Finally, at the 1938 Congress session, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose approved it as the "flag song" of the country
 yah aitihaasik adhiveshan haripura main hua tha
 Netaji performed the flag hoisting and about five thousand people present there sang the song Jhanda composed by Shyamlal Gupta Councilor

 ankiy chitreey chakrika yaa anchitch ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, ek optical discs storage media formet he or ise 1995 main Sony, Panasonic or Samsung dwaara viksit or avishkaar kiya gaya
 Its main use is to store video and data
 DVD kaa aakaar compact discs ke samaan hi hota he, lekin ye chah guna adhik data bhandaaran karte hai
 Changed forms of the term DVD often describe the data storage method on disk: data in DVD-ROM can only be read, cannot be written, DVD-R and DVD + r can record data only once
 And then act as a DVD-ROM; DVD-RW, DVD + RW and DVD-RAM can record and erase data multiple times
 maanak DVD leisure dwaara istamaal tarang dairghy 650 nm he; is prakaar, prakaash kaa rang laal he
 dvd-video and dvd-audio discs, respectively, refer to properly structured and formatted video and audio content

 In 1993, two optical disk storage formats were being developed
 ek tha multimedia compact discs bhi kaha jaataa he, jise Philips or Sony kaa samarthan hasil tha or doosraa tha super density discs, jo Toshiba, Time Warner, Matsushita Electric, Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric, Pioneer, Thomson or JVC dwaara samarthit tha
 Representatives of the SD camp contacted IBM and asked him for advice on the file system for their disk usage, as well as seeking support for their format for storing computer data
 a researcher at ibm's Almaden Research Center received that request and also learned the MMCD development project
 Wary of being caught in the duplication of expensive videotape formats between VHS and Betamax in the 1980s, he convened a meeting of a group of computer industry experts, including representatives from Apple, Microsoft, Sun, Dell, among many others
 is samooh ko technical varking group, yaa TWG ke rup main sanderbhit kiya gaya
 The TWG voted for a boycott of both formats until both camps agreed on a single, equal standard
 IBM President Lou Gerstner was recruited to put pressure on officials of opposing groups
 antat, computer companiyon kii jeet hui or ek ekal formet par sahmati hui, jise ab DVD kaha jaataa he
 TWG also collaborated with the Optical Storage Technology Association on the implementation of their ISO-13346 file system for use on new dvds
 Philips or Sony ne faisla kiya ki yah unke behatar hit main he ki ve multimedia compact discs par ek or formet yuddh se bachein or ve donon ore kii praudyogikiyon ke saath ek ekal formet jari karne ke liye super density discs kii samarthak companiyon ke saath judane par sahamat hue
 vinirdesan, dohare parat vikalp or efmplus modulan ko chhodkar, zyaadaatar Toshiba or Matsushita ke super density discs ke samaan tha
 efmplus was chosen due to its great flexibility against disk damage, such as scratches and fingerprints
 The efmplus, manufactured by Keys Imink, is 6% less efficient than the original modulation technology used by Toshiba, with a capacity of 4
7 GB against the original 5 GB
 parinaam DVD vinirdesan tha, jise DVD movie player or DVD-ROM computer anuprayogon ke liye disambar 1995 main antim rup diya gaya
 The DVD video format was first introduced by Toshiba in Japan in November 1996, in the United States in March 1997, in Europe in October 1998, and in Australia in February 1999
 may 1997 main, DVD concortium ko DVD forum ne pratisthapit kiya, jo anya sabhi companiyon ke liye khulaa he
 DVD specifications produced and updated by the DVD Forum were published as so-called DVD books
 DVD optical discs ke yantric, bhautik or optical visheshtaon ke kuch vinirdeshon ko ISO website se muft uplabdh maanak ke rup main downlod kiya ja saktaa he
 In addition, the DVD + RW Alliance publishes DVD specifications of the bump, such as DVD + R, DVD + r DL, DVD + RW or DVD + RW DL
 These DVD formats are also ISO standards
 kuch DVD vinirdesh saarvajanik rup se uplabdh nahin hai or keval DVD formet / logo licencing corporation se $ 5000 ke shulk dekar praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 Every customer has to sign a non-disclosure agreement, since some of the information in the DVD book is proprietary and confidential
 aadhikarik DVD vinirdesan dastavejon ne kabhi prathamakshar DVD ko paribhaashit nahin kiya
 There are variations in its use at the present time, such as Digital Versatile Disc, Digital Video Disc, and DVD being the most common
 DVD ko mul rup se anadhikrut digital videodisc ke prathamakshar ke rup main istemaal kiya gaya tha
 While finalizing the specifications, it was reported in 1995 that the characters officially denote digital versatile discs
 haalanki, vinirdesan ke antim rup kii ghoshnaa karne vaali press vijyapti main is takanic ko keval "DVD" sanderbhit kiya gaya he, jahaan in aksharon ke purna rup kaa koi zikr nahin kiya gaya he
 a newsgroup FAQ written by Jim Taylor claims that four years later, in 1999, the DVD forum stated that the format's name is just a three-letter "DVD" and that it has no complete form
 DVD forum website main ek bhaag he "DVD primer", jisamen is prashn "DVD kaa kya matlab he?" ke jawaab main likhaa he, "mukhya shabd 'varstile' he
 Digital Versatile Disc provides great video, audio and data storage and access - all on one disc
 " DVD ke mul prakaaron ko gigabite main unki kshamta kii sannikatataa dwaara nirdisht kiya jaataa he
 In draft versions of the specification, the DVD-5 actually had five gigabytes, but some parameters were later changed, as explained above, so the capacity decreased
 anya formet, jo 8 cm vyas or sankar kismon ke hai, unhone isse bhi bade vichlan ke saath isi tarah ke ankiy naam hasil kiye
 The 12 cm type DVD is a standard DVD and the 8 cm type is called minidvd
 ye kramshah ek maanak CD or ek mini-cd ke aakaar ke hi hote hai
 Capacities range from 6
92 mib / cm2 in DVD-1 to mib / cm2 in DVD-18, depending on the surface
 jaisaa ki hard discs drive ke saath he, DVD ke daayre main, gigabite or GB sanket ko aam taur par SI ke arth main prayog kiya jaataa he
 For variation, gibbyite is used
 Most computer operating systems display file sizes in gigabytes, megabytes, and kibby bytes, labeled as gigabytes, megabytes, and kilobytes, respectively
 DVD ke prayek sector main 2,418 bits ke data hote hai jisamen se 2,048 data upyogkarta data hote hai
 Between the + and - formats, there is a slight difference in storage space: CD dwaara 780 nm kii tulana main, DVD 650 nm tarangadairghy lager diod prakaash kaa istemaal karata he
 Compared to cds, this allows the media to be smaller crater on the surface, which allows for increased storage capacity of dvds
 isaki tulana main, DVD formet ke uttaradhikari blue-re, 405 nm ke tarang dairghy kaa upyog karata he or ek dohari parat discs main 50 GB bhandaaran kshamta hoti he
 The writing speed for the DVD was 1 ×, ie 1350 kb / s), in earlier drive and media models
 Recent more new models have 18 or 20 ×, 18 or 20 times that speed
 dhyaan den ki CD drive ke liye, 1× kaa arth he 150 kib / s, lagbhag 9 guna dhimaa
 HP initially developed recordable DVD media, inspired by the need to store data for backup and transport
 record yogya DVD kaa ab upabhokta audio or video recording ke liye bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 Three formats were developed: DVD-R / RW, DVD + r / RW and DVD-RAM
 dohari parat recording DVD-R or DVD+R discs ko kaaphi zyada data bhandaaran kii anumati detaa he - ek ekal parat discs ke 4
7 gigabite kii tulana main, prati discs 8
54 gigabite tak
 iske saath-saath, saamaanya DVD kii tulana main, DVD-DL main rhit gati dhimi he or jab ek DVD player par chalaaya jaataa he to paraton ke bich ek maamuli parivartan dekha ja saktaa he
 The DVD-R DL was developed by the Pioneer Corporation for the DVD Forum; DVD + r DL was developed by Philips and Mitsubishi Kagaku Media for DVD + RW Alliance
 ek dohare parat kii discs, apane saamaanya DVD samakaksh se is myne main alag he ki yah discs ke bheetar hi ek duusari bhautik parat kaa prayog karti he
 The drive with dual-layer capability accesses the second layer by flashing the laser through the first semi-transparent layer
 kuch DVD player main parat parivartan, kai second ke ek saafe tehraav ko pradarshit kar saktaa he
 This caused some viewers to worry that their dual-layer discs were damaged or defective, with the end result being that the studio began marking a standard message explaining the impact of the double-layer interruption on the packaging of double-layer discs
 
 is praudyogiki kaa samarthan karne vaale DVD record yogya discs, kuch maujuuda DVD player or DVD-ROM drive ke saath parshvagami sangatta banaae hue hai
 Many existing DVD recorders support dual layer technology and are now priced on par with single layer drives, although black media remains more expensive
 dohari parat media dwaara praapt ricarding gati abhi bhi ekal parat media se kam he
 There are two methods for dual-layer orientation
 DVD-ROM par istamaal kiye jane vaale paralal trek path ke saath donon parat, lead-out ke saath bhitari vyas par shuru hoti hai or bahari vyas par samaapt hoti hai, kai DVD video discs par istamaal kiye jane vaale oposit trek path ke saath, nichali parat ID par shuru hota he or upree parat OD par, jahaan anya parat samaapt hoti he; ve ek lead-in or ek lead-out saajha karti hai
 However, some DVD video discs use a parallel track, such as those written sequentially, as in a disc that has several separate serials of a TV series - where the layer changes, at most, between titles And therefore it will not be required to write the opposite track path fashion
 DVD media par saamagree ke liye DVD video ek maanak he
 This format went on sale in Japan in November 1996, in the United States in March 1997, in Europe in October 1998 in Australia in February 1999
 As of June 2003, the weekly DVD video rental overtook the weekly rental VHS cassette, showing the rapid adoption of this technology in the US market

1-channel "surround sound" The presentation is and / or MPEG-1 layer 2 and / or LPCM stereophonic
 Although the specification for video and audio requirements varies by global region and television system, many DVD players support all possible formats
 DVD video, feechar kaa bhi samarthan karte hai jaise menu, chayan yogya upasheershak, ekaadhik camera kone or kai audio trek
 DVD audio is a format for providing highly reliable audio content on a DVD
 yah kai channel ke vinyas kaa vikalp vibhinn namoonay aavritiyon par pradaan karata he
 Compared to the CD format, the DVD format, with a much higher capacity, enables the inclusion of significantly more music and / or a higher audio quality DVD audio ke ucch takneekee vinirdeshon ke baavjood, is baat par vivaad he ki kya parinamswaroop praapt audio vruddhi, vishisht shravan vaataavaran main pahachaane jane yogya he
 DVD audio currently stands as a niche market, perhaps due to a format war with rival standard sacds that DVD Video ignored
 DVD audio discs, ek DRM kriyavidhi kaa upyog karata he, jise contant protection for prirecorded media kehete hai, jise 4C samooh dwaara viksit kiya gaya he
 Although CPPM was considered more difficult to crack than the CSS of DVD videos, it was eventually cracked in 2007 with the release of the dvdcpxm tool
 baad main Libdvdcpxm librari ke jari hone se mukt strot ke DVD audio player or riping software ke vikaas kii anumati mili, jaise DVD audio explorer
 natijatan, DVD audio discs kii 1:1 pratiyaan ab apekshaakrit aasaani se bananaa sambhav he, bahut kuch dvd-video discs kii tarah
 In 2006, a new format named Blu-ray Disc designed by Sony, Samsung and Panasonic was released as the successor to the DVD
 ek anya formet, HD DVD, ne is formet ke saath 2006-08 ke formet yuddh main asafal hode lee
 ek dohari parat blue-re discs 50 se 100 GB tak sangrahit kar sakate hai
 However, unlike previous format changes, there is no immediate indication that the production of standard dvds will gradually decline, as they continue to dominate, with video sales of around 87% worldwide and around a billion DVD players are sold
 vastav main visheshgyon kaa daawa he ki DVD, ek prabhavi madhyam ke rup main abhi kam se kam or paanch saal tak bana rahegaa, chunki blue-re praudyogiki abhi bhi apane praarambhik charan main he, rhit or read gati dhimi he or saath hi saath aavashyak hardware mahange or aasaani se uplabdh nahin hote hai
 Blu-ray players have to contend partly because mpegs stored on DVD discs were based on 1-frame JPEG, which contains DCT information that can be used to improve interpolation to higher resolution
 shuru main upabhokta bhi keemat ke kaaran blue-re ko apnaane main dhime the
 As of 2009, 85% of shops were selling Blu-ray discs
 blue-re discs kaa laabh lene ke liye ek hai-definishan tivi or uchit conection cabel kii bhi aavashyaktaa he
 Some analysts suggest that the biggest hurdle to replace the DVD is due to the base installed in it; a large number of consumers are satisfied with the DVD
 DVD isliye safal hua kyonki isane VHS kaa ek aakarshak vikalp pesh kiya
 Additionally, Blu-ray players are designed for backward-compatibility, which allowed older dvds to play since the media was physically identical; This contrasted with the transition from vinyl to CD and from tape to DVD, which included a complete change in physical medium
 is sthiti ko sarvshereshth tareeke se, 78 rpm shelek recording se 45 rpm or 331⁄3 rpm vinil recording main parivartan se tulana kii ja sakati he; kyonki purv formet ke liye liye istemaal madhyam, lagbhag baad ke sanskaran ke samaan hi tha, aprachlit 78s ko bajaane ke liye phonograph kaa nirmaan is formet ke band kar die jane ke dashakon baad tak jari rahaa

 Holographic versatile disk is an optical disk technology that can hold up to 3
9 terabytes of information a day, although the current maximum is 500GB
 yah jis takanic kaa istemaal karti he use koliniar holographi ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The 5D DVD, being developed at the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia, uses a multi-laser system to encode and read multi-level data
 discs kshamta ke, 10 terabitis tak hone kaa anumaan he or yah praudyogiki das varshon ke bheetar vanijyik rup se taiyaar ho sakati he
 There are two reasons for a backup medium: obsolete and durability
 If there is no device to read the medium, it is obsolete and data is not available and thus lost
 DVD ke ticoupan kaa maapan is baat se kiya jaataa he ki discs ke data ko kitne dinon tak padhaa ja saktaa he, yah maanakar ki sangat upkaran maujuud hai jo use pard sakate hai; yani, data ke khone tak discs ko kab tak rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Five factors affect durability: seal method, reflective layer, organic dye makeup, where it was manufactured and storage methods
 optical storage technology association ke mutabik, "nirmaataa DVD, DVD-R or DVD+RW discs ke liye 30 se 100 varshon ke jeevankaal kaa or DVD-RW, DVD+RW or DVD-RAM ke liye 30 saal tak ke jeevankaal kaa daawa karte hai", haalanki 24 carat swarna-aadhaarit DVD kaa nirmaataa, 300 saal tak ke jeevankaal kaa daawa karata he
 In more traditional manufacturing processes, tayo yuden is often recommended for durability
 aise DVD jinamein vyavsaayik filmein or tivi saamagree record hoti he, copirite ke antargat aate hai
 The rise of filesharing and "piracy" forced many copyright owners to warn consumers of certain illegal uses of dvds by displaying notices on DVD packaging or showing them on the screen when content was running
 aam taur par, purv-record kii gai vanijyik DVD ke khudara kharidaar, discs kii adla-badali karne yaa use bechney ke liye tab tak swatantra nahin hai, jab tak ki usamen aisi saamagree maujuud he jis par kharidaar kaa swaamitv nahin he
 Arrangements for leasing and lending vary by geographic basis
 america main, kiraye ke liye yaa udhaar vaali DVD kharid ke adhikaar, 1976 ke copirite adhinium ke tahat pratham bikri siddhant dwaara sangrakshit he
 In Europe, rental and lending rights are relatively more limited under the 1992 European Directive, which gives copyright holders broad rights to commercially rent or public use DVD copies of their works

 Elton argues that there was a major Tudor revolution in government
 henry ko budhimaani or chaalaaki kaa shrey dete hue, alton kehete hai ki unke adhikansh sakaaratmak krity, visheshtah rome ke saath sambandhon kii samaapti, thomas cromwel kaa kaary tha, raja kaa nahin
 Elton considers Henry a capable, but extremely lazy, subject to direct control of affairs for any extended period; That is, the king was an opportunist who depended on other people for doing most of his ideas and doing most of the work
 henry ke vaivaahik saahas alton ke pramaanon kii shrinkhalaa ke bhaag hai; alton ullekh karte hai ki ek purush, jo chah patniyon se vivaah karata he, aisa vyakti nahin he, jiskaa apane swayan ke bhagya par puraa niyantran ho
 Elton demonstrates that Thomas Cromwell envisioned a Commonwealth of England, which included popular participation through Parliament, and that this was generally expressed in the Preamble to the Law
 sansadeey sahmati kaa arth yah nahin tha ki raja ne apana koi bhi adhikaar chhod diya tha; henry ashtum ek pitrusulabh shaasha the, jo apni shakti kaa prayog karne se jhijakte nahin the

 henry ne kabhi bhi aupchaarik rup se roman catholic carch ko asweekaar nahin kiya, lekin san 1534 main unhone swayan ko carch of england kaa sarvocch pramukh ghoshit kar diya
 As a result of this act and subsequent acts, a separate Church called the Church of England eventually came into existence

 The divorce issue presented an example of this problem, but the issue itself was not the cause of the problem
 ek nai patni or ek uttaradhikari kii unki ichha kii tulana main henry dwaara kiye gayi english carch ke sudhaar main adhik jatil uddeshy va vidhiyaan shaamil thim
 Henry insisted that his first marriage had never been valid, but the issue of divorce was only a factor in Henry's desire to reform the church

 The new political theology of obeying the prince's orders was decisive for Henry's reforms, enthusiastically adopted by the Church of England in the 1530s
 yah chauthe dharmadesh kii martin luther kii nai vyakhya ko pratibimbit karata tha or ise angrez darshakon ke bich prastut karne main wiliam tindel ne madhyasthata kii
 The establishment of royal authority over the Ten Commandments and thus the Word of God was a particularly attractive feature of this doctrine, which became the defining feature of the religion established by Henry

 The Reformers attempted to preserve Luther's connection with the more comprehensive framework of theology and focused only on faith and the word of God, while conservatives emphasized good works, events, and philanthropy

 He said, "your Excellency, with folded hands, i humbly ask you to leave me and my answer is for good intentions
" apni eemaandaaree kaa tyaag karne ke bajaay main apane jivan kaa tyaag kar duungi"
 This refusal attracted Henry more and they continued to try to get him
 antat en ne henry ke moh main apane liye ek avasar dekha or ve is baat par ad gayi ki ve keval england kii sweekrut rani ke rup main hi unka aalingan karengi
 For this it was necessary to remove Catherine from the post of queen
 jald hi yah raja kii teevr ichha ban gai ki catherine ke saath unke vivaah ko nirast kiya jaae
 Henry directly prayed to the Holy See without telling Cardinal Thomas Woolsey, from whom he had kept his plans for Ann secret
 iske bajaay, vivaah ke nirastikaran kaa nivedan karne ke liye henry ke sachiv, wiliam nite, ko pope clement saptam ke paas bheja gaya
 The basis for this was that Pope Julius ii's order was obtained by false pretenses because Catherine's brief marriage to the unhealthy Arthur had also resulted in physical relations between them
 henry ne prarthana kii ki vivaah ke nirastikaran kii sthiti main unhen kisi bhi mahila se punah vivaah karne kii anumati di jaae, bhale hi vah sambandh kii pratham shrenee main aati ho or chaahe vah sambandh vaid athwa avaidh rishte ke dwaara bana ho
 This was clearly in reference to Ann Boleyn
 haalanki, chunki us samay catherine ke bhai, samraat charles pancham, dwaara pope ko bandi bana liya gaya tha, atah un tak pahunch paanaa nite ke liye kathin tha or ve keval nae vivaah ke liye sashart chhot hi praapt kar sake
 Now Henry had no choice but to hand over the issue to wolsey
he did everything Woolsey could is nirnay ko raja ke paksh main surakshit karne ke liye woolsi jo kuch bhi kar sakate the vah unhone kiya, yahaan tak ki unhone ek carch sambandhi nyaayalay kii england main sunwaayee sabha bhi yojit kii jisamen pope kaa ek pratinidhi bhi shaamil tha
 The fourth scene of the second part of Shakespeare's play, Henry VIII, accurately records Catherine's awe-inspiring adventure of Eragon in that remarkable court
 vah, ek durjey or spashtatah galat samajhi gai mahila, jhukkar henry ko pranaam karti he, swayan ko uski dayaa par chhod detii he, niruttar kar dene vaali vakpatutaa ke saath apni baat kahati he or tezi se us adaalat ke kamare se baahar nikal jaati he
 Although, mostly, this moment turned the people present there and the rest of the world in his favor, the Pope had never intended to empower his representative
 charles pancham ne apni chachee ke vivaah ke nirastikaran kaa virodh kiya, lekin yah spasht nahin he ki pope par iskaa kitna prabhaav padaa
 parantu yah spasht he ki henry ne dekha ki samraat kii chachee se hue vivaah ke liye unhen pope dwaara nirastikaran diya janaa asambhavit tha
 The pope prohibited Henry from marrying a new marriage until a decision was delivered in the court of Rome, not in England
 is nirastikaran ke liye woolsi ko zimmedaar tehraaya gaya
 Woolsey was a Catholic while Ann was a Protestant-minded Christian and wanted to remove Catholics who held key positions to promote the reformist movement in England
 en boleen ne henry par tab tak dabaav banaae rakhaa jab tak ki san 1529 main woolsi ko saarvajanik pad se barkhaast na kar diya gaya
 Upon being sacked, the cardinal pleads with him to assist him to return to the post but Ann refuses
 tab usne en ko nirvaasan ke liye baadhya kiye jane kii yojana par kaary karnaa shuru kiya or iske liye rani catherine va pope se sampark karnaa prarambh kar diya
 When this was discovered, Henry ordered Wolsey's arrest and if he had not died due to illness in 1530, he might have been hanged for treason
 unke sthaan par aaye sar thomas mor ne prarambh main raja kii nai niti ke saath sahyog karte hue sansad main woolsi kii ninda kii or oxford va cambridge ke dharamshasreiyon ke is mat kaa samarthan kiya ki catherine ke saath henry kaa vivaah gairqanoonee tha
 When Henry, under the influence of Anne, began to reject the authority of the Pope and to promote reformist movements, the peacock of the Catholic faith increased
 ek varsh baad, rani catherine ko darbar se nikaal diya gaya or uske puraane kaksh en ko de diye gaye
 Due to the absence of Woolsey, Ann had substantial power in political matters
 apane samay ke lihaaj se vah ek asaamaanya rup se shikshit va budhimaan mahila thi or vah protestant sudhaaron ke vichaaron ke prati atyadhik tallin or sammilit thi
 When Archbishop William Warham of Canterbury died, Ann appointed Chaplin of the Boleyn family, Thomas Cranmer, to this vacant position

 Following these laws, Thomas More resigned from his post as Chancellor and Cromwell became Henry's chief minister

 On 23 May 1533, Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine's marriage null and void, ruling in a special court held in Dunstable Priory to decide on the legality of the king's marriage to Catherine of Aragon
 paanch dinon baad, 28 may 1533 ko cranmar ne ghoshnaa kii ki henry va en kaa vivaah vaid tha
 The Queen's title was formally stripped from Catherine, and on 1 June 1533 Ann was crowned Queen

 The daughter was named Elizabeth in honor of Henry's mother, Elizabeth of York

 Vygotsky was a thinker who worked during the first decades of the former Soviet Union
 unka maananaa tha ki bachche vyaavhaarik anubhav ke madhyam se sikhte hai jaise ki piyajet ne suzav diya tha

 It is equally applicable in voluntary attention, logical memory, and concept formation
 sabhi ucch kaaryon kii utpatti vyaktiyon ke bich ke vaastavik sambandhon ke rup main hoti he
 Vygotsky felt that development was a process and saw periods of crisis in the child's development during which there was a qualitative change in the child's mental functioning

 Anurag theorists believe that for the normal social and emotional development of a human baby, it is necessary to have a relationship with at least one caregiver
 arikson naamak frid ke ek anuyaayi ne frid ke saath-saath apane swayan ke siddhanton ko sanshleshit karke jis siddhant rachana kii use maanav vikaas ke "manosamaajik" charnon ke naam se janaa jaataa he; isaki samay seemaa janm se mrityu tak he or jo har charan main jin "kaaryon" par dhyaan kendrit karata he un kaaryon ko jivan kii chunautiyon kaa safaltaapurvak maargdarshan karne ke liye puraa karnaa jaruri he
 John b
 Watson's pragmatism theory forms the foundation of a practical model of development
 unhone bachche ke vikaas par bahut kuch likhaa or kai shodh kiye 
 vyavhaar siddhant kii dhara ke nirmaan main wiliam james kii chetana dhara drushtikon ke sanshodhan main watasan madadgaar sabit hue
 watasan ne dikhaai dene or maapne yogya vyavhaar ke aadhaar par uddeshypurna shodh vidhiyon kaa armbh karke bachche ke manovigyaan ke liye ek prakritik vigyaan pariprekshya ko laane main bhi madad kii
 B
 Watson following Watson's leadership
 F
 Skinner later extended this model to cover operant conditioning and verbal behavior
 yon chaalit hone ke naate ek buniyadi maanav prerana ke apane drushtikon ke anusaar sigmund frid ne shaishvavastha se aage maanav vikaas kaa ek manoyon siddhant viksit kiya or use paanch charnon main vibhajit kiya
 Each phase was centered around the ejaculatory area of the body or the satisfaction of libido within a particular area
 unhone yah bhi tark diya ki manushyon kaa jaise-jaise vikaas hota he vaise-vaise ve apane vikaas ke charnon ke madhyam se alag-alag or vishisht vastuon par sthir hote jate hai
 Each stage has differences that need to be resolved to enable the child's development
 vikaas ke vichaar ke liye ek dhaanche ke rup main gatyaatmak pranaaliyon ke siddhant kaa istemaal 1990 ke dashak ke armbh main shuru hua or vartmaan sadi main iskaa istemaal abhi bhi jari he
 Dynamic system theory emphasizes nonlinear relationships and the ability of a system to reorganize as a phase change that is stage-like in nature
 vikasvaadiyon ke liye ek anya upyogi avadharana aakarshankarta kii sthiti he; yah avasthaa jaahir taur par asambandhit vyavhaaron ke saath-saath sambandhit vyavhaaron kaa bhi nirdhaaran karne main madad karti he
 Dynamic system theory is extensively applied in the study of motor development; This theory also has a deep connection with some of Bowlby's view of attachment systems
 gatyaatmak pranali siddhant kaa sambandh vyavhaar prakriya kii avadharana se bhi he jo ek parsparik baatcheet prakriya he jisamen bachche or mata-pita ek saath ek duusare ko prabhavit karte hai jisase samay-samay par donon main vikasaatmak parivartan hota he
 The core knowledge perspective is a developmental theory in child development that proposes that "infants' lives begin with intuitive and special-purpose knowledge systems that are referred to as core domains of thinking"
 There are five core domains of thinking, each of which is very important for survival defense, which together prepare us for the development of key aspects of initial cognition; They are: physical, numerical, linguistic, psychological and biological
 haalaanki vikasaatmak lakshyon kii pahchaan karnaa shodhakartaaon or bacchon kii dekharekh karne waalon ke liye ek dilachasp kaam he lekin phir bhi vikasaatmak parivartan ke kai pahalu satat hote hai or ve parivartan ke dikhaai dene yogya milastons ko pradarshit nahin karte hai
 Continuous developmental changes, such as growth in stature, involve considerable gradual and predictable progress toward adult characteristics
 haalaanki jab vikasaatmak parivartan asatat hota he tab shodhakarta na keval vikaas ke milastons kii balki aksar charan kahe jane vaale sambandhit aayu avadhiyon kii bhi pahchaan kar sakate hai
 a phase is a period of time often associated with a known chronological age range during which a behavior or physical feature is qualitatively different from other stages
 jab kisi aayu avadhi ko ek charan ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he to is shabd kaa matlab keval gunatmak antar nahin hota he balki iskaa matlab vikasaatmak ghatnaon kaa ek purvanumey kram bhi hota he jaise ki prayek charan se pehle or baad main vishisht vyavaharik yaa shaareerik gunon ke saath judi anya vishisht avadhiyaan hoti hai
 Stages of development may occur simultaneously or may be associated with other specific aspects of development such as speaking or walking
 Even the transition to a stage in a particular developmental area may not mean that the previous phase is completely finished
 udhaaharan ke liye, vyaktitv ke charnon ke bare main arikson kii charchaa main yah siddhantkaar suzav detaa he ki un muddon par nae sire se kaam karne main jivan biit jaataa he jo multah bachapan ke charan kii visheshtaayen thi
 Similarly, Ciaget, a theorist of cognitive development, described situations in which children could solve one type of problem using mature thinking skills but could not cater for less familiar problems; He named this phenomenon horizontal decalage
 haalaanki vikasaatmak parivartan kalanukramik aayu ke saath-saath chalata he, vikaas main swayan aayu kaa koi yogadan nahin hota he
 The basic mechanism or cause of developmental changes are genetic and environmental factors
 anuvanshik kaarak koshikeey parivartanon jaise samgr vikaas, sharir or dimag ke hisson ke anupaat main hone vaale parivartanon or drushti evam aahaar sambandhi jaruraton jaise kaary ke pahaluon kii paripakvata ke liye jimmedaar hote hai
 Because jeans can be "off" and "on", the function of an individual's initial genotype may change from time to time, leading to further developmental change
 vikaas ko prabhavit karne vaale paryaavarniya karkon main aahaar evam rog jokhim ke saath-saath saamaajik, bhaavnaatmak or sangyanatmak anubhav bhi shaamil ho sakate hai
 However, examination of environmental factors also suggests that young humans can also survive a fairly wide range of environmental experiences
 swatantra kriyavidhi ke rup main kaam karne ke bajaay anuvanshik or paryaavarniya kaarak aksar ek duusare ko prabhavit karte hai jisaki vajah se vikasaatmak parivartan hota he
 Some aspects of a child's development are notable for their plasticity or the extent to which the direction of development is guided by environmental factors as well as initiated by genetic factors
 udhaaharan ke liye, aisa lagata he ki allergy sambandhi pratikriyaaon kaa vikaas apekshaakrit rup se praarambhik jivan ke kuch paryaavarniya karkon ke jokhim kii vajah se hota he or praarambhik jokhim se suraksha karne se bachche main parivarti allergic pratikriya ke dikhaai dene kii kam sambhaavna rah jaati he
 When initial experience has a great impact on any aspect of development, it is said that it shows a lot of plasticity; When genetic nature is the primary factor of development, it is said that plasticity is low
 namaneeyata main antarjaat karkon jaise hormone ke saath-saath bahirzaat karkon jaise sankraman kaa maargdarshan shaamil ho saktaa he
 a variety of environmental guidance for development is described as experience-dependent plasticity in which behavior changes as a result of learning from the environment
 is prakaar namaneeyata jivan bhar ho sakati he or isamen kuch bhaavnaatmak pratikriyaaon sahit kai tarah ke vyavhaar shaamil ho sakate hai
 a second type of plasticity, experience-expected plasticity, involves considerable influence of specific experiences during limited sensitive periods of development
 udhaaharan ke liye, do ankhon kaa samanvit upyog or prayek aankh main prakaash dwaara nirmit dwiaiami chhaviyon ke bajaay ek ekal triayami chhavi kaa anubhav jivan ke pehle varsh kii duusari chamahi ke dauraan drushti ke saath anubhavon par nirbhar karata he
 Experience-expectant plasticity serves to correct developmental aspects that may not achieve optimal results as a result of genetic factors
 vikaas ke kuch pahaluon main namaneeyata ke astitv ke alaava, anuvaanshik-paryaavarniya sahasambandh vyakti kii paripakv visheshtaon ke nirdhaaran main kai tarah se kaary kar sakate hai
 Genetic-environmental correlations are situations in which genetic factors are likely to have some degree of experience
 udhaaharan ke liye, niskriy anuvanshik-paryaavarniya sahasambandh main, ek bachche ko kisi vishesh paryaavaran kaa anubhav hone kii sambhaavna hoti he kyonki uske mata-pita kaa anuvanshik swabhaav unhen aise kisi maahaul ko chunane yaa banane ke liye prerit kar saktaa he
 The genetically evolved characteristics of the child in the suggestive genetic – environmental correlation cause others to respond in certain ways that give them a different environment that a genetically different child can find; For example, a child with Down syndrome may be treated more protective and less challenging than a child with a non-down syndrome
 ant main, ek sakriy anuvanshik-paryaavarniya sahasambandh ek aisa sambandh he jisamen baccha un anubhavon ko chunata he jo badale main un par prabhaav daalata ho; udhaaharan ke liye, ek hrisht-pusht sakriy baccha skool ke baad ke khel anubhavon ko chun saktaa he jisase vardhit athlettic kaushal kaa nirmaan hota he lekin shaayad sangeet kii shiksha main baadha aa sakati he
 In all of these cases, it becomes difficult to ascertain whether the child's characteristics were formed by a combination of genetic factors or experiences or both
 bachche ke vikaas kii ek upyogi samaj ko sthapit karne ke liye vikasaatmak ghatnaon ke bare main vyavasthit poochtacha kii aavashyaktaa he
 Different aspects of development involve different methods and causes of change, so there is no simple way to summarize a child's development
 phir bhi, prayek vishay ke bare main kuch sawaalon ke jawaab dene se vikasaatmak parivartan ke vibhinn pahaluon ke bare main tulaneey jaankaree mil sakati he
 Waters and his colleagues have suggested the following questions for this purpose
 in sawaalon ke jawaab dene ke liye kiye jane vaale anubhavjanya shodh main kai paddatiyon kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Initially, supervisory research under natural conditions may be needed to develop a detailed description and definition of an aspect of developmental change, such as changes in variable responses in the first year
 is prakaar ke kaam ke baad sahasambandhi adhyayan, kalanukramik aayu ke bare main jaankaree ikaitha karnaa or shabdaawalee vikaas jaise kuch khaas tarah ke vikaas ko kiya ja saktaa he; parivartan ke bare main bataane ke liye sahasambandhi aankadon kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Such studies examine the characteristics of children at different ages
 in tareekon main anudairdhya adhyayan shaamil ho sakate hai jinamein bacchon ke ek samooh kii kai baar phir se jaanch kii jaati he jab ve bade hote hai, yaa paar-anubhageeya adhyayan shaamil ho sakate hai jinamein alag-alag umr ke bacchon ke samoohon kii ek baar jaanch kii jaati he or ek duusare ke saath unki tulana kii jaati he, yaa in tareekon kaa ek sangyojan shaamil ho saktaa he
 Some studies related to child development necessarily examine the effects of experience or heredity by comparing the characteristics of different groups of children in a nonrandom design
 anya adhyayanon main bacchon ke samoohon ke liye parinaamon kii tulana karne ke liye yadrichhik diginon kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he jinhen alag-alag hastkshep yaa shaikshik upachaar miltaa he
 Milestones are changes in specific physical and mental abilities that mark the end of one developmental period and the beginning of another developmental period
 charan siddhanton ke liye milastons se charan parivartan kaa sanket miltaa he
 Studies of the completeness of many developmental tasks have established specific chronological ages associated with developmental milestones
 haalaanki, saamaanya seemaa ke bheetar vikasaatmak chakron vaale bacchon ke bich bhi milastons kii prapti main kaaphi antar he
 Some milestones are more variable than others; For example, receptive speech indicators show considerable variation in hearing impaired children in general but expressive speech milestones can be quite variable
 bachche ke vikaas se sambandhit ek aam chintaa vikasaatmak deree he jisamen mahatvapurn vikasaatmak milastons ke liye ek aayu-vishisht kshamta main deree shaamil he
 Prevention of developmental delay and early intervention in it is an important topic of study of the child's development
 vikasaatmak deree kii pahchaan kisi milastone kii vishisht parivartaneeyata ke saath tulana karke, na ki uplabdhi main ausat aayu ke sambandh main, kerani chahie
 An example of a milestone might be eye and hand coordination that involves the child's increased ability to manipulate objects in a coordinated manner
 aayu-vishisht milastonon ke badhate gyaan se mata-pita or dusron ko uchit vikaas par najar rakhane main aasaani hoti he
 The issue of child development is not a solitary subject but it progresses differently for different aspects of the individual to some extent
 yahan kai shaareerik or maansik visheshtaon ke vikaas kaa varnan diya gaya he
 xxrep 4 = What develops? After birth, physical development takes place in the area of height and weight from 15 to 20 years of age; Growing at the right time, the average birth weight is 3
5 kg and the average length is 50 cm as the person grows to full adult size
 jaise-jaise kad or vajan badhata jaataa he vaise-vaise vyakti ke shaareerik anupaat bhi badalte hai, navjaat shishu kaa sir apekshaakrit bada or dhad tathaa baaki ang chote hote hai jo ki vayask hone par apekshaakrit rup se chote sir or lambey dhad tathaa angon main parinat ho jaataa he
 The pace of physical development accelerates in the months following birth and slows down thereafter, so birth weight doubles in the first four months and triples at 12 months of age but does not quadruple by 24 months
 yauvan ke thodaa pehle tak vikaas dhimi gati se hota rahata he,uske baad vikaas kii gati kaaphi teevr ho jaati he
 There is no uniformity in the rate and timing of growth in all parts of the body
 janm ke samay sir kaa aakaar pehle se hi lagbhag ek vayask ke sir ke aakaar kii tarah hota he lekin sharir ke nichle hisse vayask ke nichle hisson kii tulana main kaaphi chote hote hai
 After that, in the course of development, the head gradually becomes smaller and there is a rapid development in the torso and other organs
 vruddhi dar ke nirdhaaran main or khaas taur par aarambhik maanav vikaas kii anupaatik visheshta main hone vaale parivartanon ke nirdhaaran main anuvanshik karkon kii ek mukhya bhoomika hoti he
 However, due to genetic factors, maximum growth can occur only when environmental conditions are favorable
 Poor nutrition and frequent injury and disease can cause a person's adult stature to decline, but due to the best environment, the height may not increase as much as is determined by heredity
 vruddhi ke kshetra main jansankhya antar kaaphi had tak vayask ke kad se sambandhit hote hai
 Children of castes that live much longer in adulthood tend to be taller at birth and during childhood than groups with shorter adult stature
 purush bhi kuch had tak lambey hote hai haalaanki vayask avasthaa main majboot yon dvirupta vaale jatigat samoohon main yah adhik spasht hota he
 Particularly malnourished people also remain small or short throughout life
 haalaanki vruddhi dar or paddati main jansankhya antar adhik nahin hota he, sivaay iske ki kharaab paryaavarniya paristhitiyaan yauvan or sambandhit vruddhi dar main deree kaa kaaran ban sakati hai
 Apparently the different ages of boys and girls at puberty mean that boys and girls aged 11 or 12 are at significantly different levels of maturity and in contrast to normal sex differences in terms of physical size
 Can occur
 bachapan main kad or vajan ke maamle main kaaphi vyaktigat antar hota he
 Some of these differences are due to family genetic factors and other differences are environmental factors, but individual differences in reproductive maturation have a greater impact on them at some point in the course of development
 shaareerik gatividhi kii kshamtaaon main bachapan ke dauraan mote taur par yuva shishu kii parivarti gatividhi paddatiyon se bachapan or kishoravastha kii ati kushal svaichhik gativadhi visheshta main parivartan hota he
 The speed of motor development accelerates in early life because many of the newborn's variable activities change or disappear within the first year and later slow down
 shaareerik vruddhi kii tarah motor vikaas se bhi sephalokodel or proximodystal vikaas kii purvanumey paddatiyon kaa pataa chalata he or sharir ke nichle hisse yaa haathon or pairon se pehle sir ke antim sire or adhik kendriya kshetron kii gatividhiyon yaa harkaton par niyantran sthapit ho jaataa he
 The types of activity develop in stages like stages; For example, for 6 to 8 months of action, crawling on both hands and both legs and then trying to stand up, "clinging" to something while holding it, holding an adult's hand and finally moving freely Walking is included
 bade bachche agal-bagal yaa peeche-peeche chalakar, teji se chalakar yaa daudkar, kudakar, ek pair se langhakar or duusare pair se chalakar or ant main langhakar is kram ko jari rakhte hai
 By mid-childhood and adolescence, new motor skills are acquired through instruction or supervision rather than a predictable sequence
 motor vikaas main shaamil kriyavidhiyon yaa prakriyaaon main kuch anuvanshik ghatak shaamil hote hai jo ek nirdisht aayu main sharir ke hisson ke shaareerik aakaar ke saath-saath mansapeshiyon or haddiyon kii takat se jude pahaluon kaa bhi nirdhaaran karte hai
 Nutrition and exercise also determine strength, and therefore also determine the ease and accuracy with which a body part can be moved
 harakat karne ke avasaron se sharir ke hisson ko jhukaane or failaane kii kshamtaaon kii sthapana main madad milti he jinamein se donon kshamtaayen acchhee motor kshamta ke liye jaruri hai
 Skilled voluntary activities develop as a result of practice and learning
 saamaanya vyakti kii motor kshamta saamaanya hoti he or yah kuch had tak bachche ke vajan or nirmaan par nirbhar karti he
 However, the practice, supervision, and instruction of specific activities have a major impact on normal personal differences after infancy
 asaamaanya motor vikaas swaleenta yaa mastishk pakshaaghaat jaisi samasyaon yaa vikasaatmak vilamb kaa ek sanket ho saktaa he
 There are also some population differences in the field of motor development under which girls get some benefit from the use of small muscles, including the pronunciation of sounds from lips and tongue
 navjaat shishuon kii parivarti gatividhiyon main jaateey antar hone kii khabar mili he jisase yah pataa chalata he ki kuch jaivik kaarak bhi kriyasheel hai
 Cultural differences can encourage learning of motor skills such as using only the left hand for hygiene purposes and the use of the right hand for all other tasks that make up the population gap
 abhyaas vaali svaichhik gatividhiyon main saanskrithik karkon ko bhi kriyasheel rup main dekha jaataa he jaise footbal ko aage kii taraf le jane ke liye pair kaa istemaal karnaa yaa basketbaal ko aage kii taraf le jane ke liye haath kaa istemaal karnaa
 Young children have the ability to learn, remember and symbolize information and solve problems at a normal level that can perform cognitive tasks such as discriminating between conscious and unconscious creatures or identifying small numbers of objects
 bachapan main seekhney or jaankaree ko sansaadhit karne kii gati bad jaati he, smriti bhi badhati chali jaati he or sanket upyog or sankshepan kii kshamta main tab tak vikaas hota he jab tak kishoravastha lagbhag vayask str tak nahin pahunch jaati he
 Cognitive development has genetic and other biological mechanisms as seen in many genetic factors of mental retardation
 haalaanki yah maan lene ke baavjood ki mastishk kaaryon kii vajah sangyanatmak ghatnaayen hoti hai, vishisht mastishk parivartanon ko maapna or yah dikhaanaa sambhav nahin he ki unki vajah se hi sangyanatmak parivartan hote hai
 Developmental advancements in the field of cognition are also related to experience and learning and this is mainly a matter of high-level competencies such as summarization which largely depends on formal education
 un umron main saamaanya vyaktigat antar dekhne ko milte hai jin umron main vishisht sangyanatmak kshamtaaon kii prapti hoti he lekin audyogic deshon main bacchon kii schuli shiksha is dharna par aadhaarit hoti he ki ye antar bahut bade nahin hai
 Abnormal delays in cognitive development can cause problems for children in cultures that demand advanced cognitive skills for work and for independent living
 sangyanatmak vikaas ke kshetra main bahut kam jansankhya antar dekhne ko milte hai
 There are some differences in the skills and preferences of boys and girls but a lot happens together in groups
 aisa lagata he ki alag-alag jaateey samoohon kii sangyanatmak uplabdhi main paae jane vaale antar saanskrithik yaa anya paryaavarniya karkon ke parinaam hai
 Newborns probably do not experience fear nor do they prefer to establish contact with a particular person
 lagbhag 8 se 12 maheenon tak unamem kaaphi teji se parivartan hota he or gyaat khataron se bhaybheet ho jate hai; ve parichit logon ko variyata bhi dene lag jate hai or unase alag hone par yaa kisi ajanabi ke saamne aane par unamem chintaa or dukh ke bhav nazar aane lagate hai
 Empathy and the ability to understand social rules begin in the preschool period and continue to develop in the adult period
 madhya bachapan main hamaumr bacchon ke saath dosti or kishoravastha main kaamuktha se judi bhaawanaaon or romantic prem kii shuruyaat hoti he
 There is a lot of anger during the childhood and early preschool period and adolescence
 saamaajik bhaavnaatmak vikaas ke kuch pahaluon, jaise sahanubhuti, kaa vikaas dhire-dhire hota he lekin anya pahaluon, jaise bhay, main bachche kii bhaavana ke anubhav kaa ek apekshaakrit achaanak punargathan shaamil ho saktaa he
 Sexual and romantic feelings develop in relation to physical maturity
 aisa lagata he ki anuvanshik kaarak purvanumey aayu main hone vaale bhay or parichit logon ke prati lagaav jaise kuch saamaajik-bhaavnaatmak vikaason ko niyantrit karte hai
 Experience plays a major role in determining what people are familiar with, what social rules are followed and how anger is expressed
 saamaajik-bhaavnaatmak vikaas ke kram main vyaktigat antar kaa hona koi aam baat nahin he lekin ek saamaanya bachche se duusare saamaanya bachche kii bhaawanaaon kii tivrata yaa abhivyaktitv main bahut zyada antar ho saktaa he
 The individualistic tendencies of the various types of reactions are perhaps natural and are referred to as a natural difference
 saamaajik bhaavnaatmak visheshtaon kaa asaamaanya vikaas thodaa alag kism ho saktaa he yaa itnaa gambhir ho saktaa he ki isse maansik beemaari kaa sanket milane lage
 Temperamental symptoms are considered to be stable and durable during life time
 ummid he ki shaishvavastha main sakriy or krodhit rahane vaale bachche bade bacchon, kishoron or vayaskon ke rup main sakriy or krodhi ho sakate hai
 Population differences may exist in older children, for example if they have learned that it is appropriate for children to express emotion or behave differently than girls, or if customs learned by children of an ethnic group - Rivaz is different from customs learned by another child
 kisi nirdisht aayu ke ladakon or ladakiyon ke bich kaa saamaajik or bhaavnaatmak antar donon lingon kii yauvan visheshtaon ke samay ke antar se bhi judaa hua ho saktaa he
 In addition to acquiring highly spoken vocabulary, there are four main areas in which a child must acquire competence regardless of the language spoken or spoken
 inhen dhwani vigyaan yaa dhwani, arth vigyaan yaa kutabaddh arth, vaakya rachana yaa shabdon ko sanyukt karne kaa tarika or yathatathy yaa alag-alag paristhitiyon main bhashaa kaa istemaal karne ke gyaan ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he
 There is a gradual development in receptive language, which begins at about 6 months of age
 haalaanki bhavvaahak bhashaa or shabdon ke nirmaan main, lagbhag ek saal kii umr main isaki shuruyaat ke baad se kaaphi teji aa jaati he or saath main duusare saal ke bich main drut shabd adhigrahan kaa ek "shabdaawalee visphot" sa hone lagata he
 This vocabulary extension is closely associated with the ability to repeat spoken words and enables rapid acquisition of skills in their pronunciation
 vyakaranik niyam or shabd sangyojan lagbhag do saal kii umr main dikhaai dete hai
 The mastery of vocabulary and grammar continues slowly through the preschool and school years
 kishor-kishoriyon ke paas abhi bhi vayaskon kii tulana main kam shabdasangrah hote hai or pasive wois jaisi sanrachanaon ke saath adhik kathinaayee kaa anubhav hota he
 Children up to one month old can pronounce "ooh" sounds, perhaps resulting from pleasant interactions with caregivers in a mutual "conversation"
 stern ke mutabik, yah prakriya kisi aapasi, layaaddh baatcheet main vayask or shishu ke bich ke prabhaav kaa sanchaar he
 The anticipation of subsequent negotiation transactions considers surmounting and "gay-coupling" in which the infant and adult have different roles
 lagbhag 6 se 9 maheene ke bachche or adhik swar varnon or kuch vyanjan varnon kaa uccharan karne lagate hai or "shabdnukaran" karne lagate hai yaa "dadadada" jaisi dhvaniyon ko aksar doharaate rahete hai jisamen parvarti boli kii kuch dhvanyatmak visheshtaon kii maujuudagi kaa pataa chalata he
 It is believed that an important part of dialect development is the time caregivers spend to "guess" what their baby is trying to say and thus integrate the child with his or her social world is
 shishur ke uccharanon main vaicharikta ke sambandh ko "saajha smriti" kaha jaataa he or yah ek taatkaalik rup main kaaryon, iraadon or pratikriyaswaroop kaaryon kii ek jatil shrinkhalaa kaa nirmaan karata he
 It has been argued that children's vowel systems develop in such a way that they are parallel to adult languages even if they are using unrecognizable "words"
 The first words have the function of naming or labeling but also have a meaning such as "milk" which means "I want milk"
 Generally, at the age of 18 months, the vocabulary of about 20 words increases to around 200 words at the age of 21 months
 lagbhag 18 maheene kii umr se baccha do shabd vaale vaakyon main shabdon ko sanyukt karnaa shuru kar detaa he
 The adult usually expands this to clarify the meaning
 24-27 maheene kii umr tak baccha ekadam se sateek na hone par bhi taarkik vaakya rachana kaa istemaal karke teen yaa chaar shabdon vaale vaakyon kaa nirmaan karne lagata he
 The theory behind this is that children use a basic set of rules such as adding 's' to plural words or making simple words out of very difficult words such as using "choskit" for chocolate biscuits
 iske baad vyakaran ke niyamon or vaakyon ke sahi kram main teji se vikaas hone lagata he
 Rhyming often begins to take interest, and imaginative play often involves dialogue
 bacchon ke record kiye gaye monolog arthpurna ikaayiyon main jaankaree ko sangathit karne kii prakriya ke vikaas main antardrushti pradaan karte hai
 By the age of three, the child begins to use complex sentences, including relative clauses, although reform work still continues in various linguistic systems
 paanch saal kii umr tak baccha kaaphi had tak vayask kii tarah bhashaa kaa istemaal karne lag jaataa he
 From around the age of three, children can linguistically indicate illusion or imagination, creating personal stories and fictional stories consistent with the beginning and the end
 yah tark diya jaataa he ki bachche apane swayan ke anubhav ko samajhane ke ek tareeke ke rup main or dusron ko apana matlab samajhane ke ek madhyam ke rup main kahani kaa sahaara lete hai
 The ability to engage in extended debate arises from regular interactions with adults and peers over time
 iske liye bachche ko apane drushtikon ko dusron ke drushtikonon or bahari ghatnaon ke saath milaane ke tareeke ko seekhney kii jarurat he or vah aisa kar rahaa he, yah sabit karne ke liye use bhashaai sanketakon kaa istemaal karne kaa tarika bhi seekhney kii jarurat he
 They also learn to adjust their language depending on who they are talking to
 aam taur par lagbhag 9 saal kii umr tak apane khud ke anubhavon ke alaava anya kahaniyon kaa varnan lekhak, kahani ke paatro or apane khud ke ke drushtikonon se kar saktaa he
 Despite the important role that adult conversation plays in facilitating a child's learning, there is considerable disagreement among theorists about the extent to which children's initial meanings and semantic words relate directly to internal factors related to the child's cognitive functions
 Adults arise from conversation
 nae shabdon ke praarambhik maanchitran, prasang se pare shabdon ko samajhane kii kshamta or arth ko parishkrut karne ke bare main kai alag-alag nishkarsh praapt hue hai
 One hypothesis is known as the syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis, which refers to a child's ability to infer meaning from gestures using grammatical information from sentence structure
 ek anya pariklpana bahut-margi model he jisamen yah tark diya jaataa he ki prasang se bandhe shabd or sandarbh sambandh shabd alag-alag margon kaa anusaran karte hai; pehle vaale ko ghatana pradarshnon ke aadhaar par chitrit kiya jaataa he or baad vaale ko maansik pradarshnon ke aadhaar par chitrit kiya jaataa he
 Despite paternal input having an extremely important role in this model, children rely on cognitive processes to determine subsequent use of words
 baharhaal, bhashaa vikaas par kiye gaye prakritik shodh se yah sanket mila he ki prischuli bacchon ke shabd sangrah vayaskon dwaara unhen bataae gaye shabdon kii sankhya se kaaphi had tak jude hai

 Probably Surendranath Pandey and Yashpal had decided to go to Russia, but between 1928-31, there was such a series of martyrdom that the party almost fell apart
 jabaki yah baat sach nahin he
 When Bhagat Singh went to throw a bomb in the assembly against Chandrashekhar Azad's wish, the party was completely responsible for Azad
 sanders vadh main bhi unhone bhagat singh kaa saath diya or baad main unhen chhudaane kii puri koshish bhi kii
 Going against Azad's advice, Yashpal threw a bomb on the Viceroy's car near Delhi on 23 December 1929, Azad was aghast because the Viceroy had survived but some other employees were killed
 azaad ko 28 may 1930 ko bhagwati charan vohara kii bam-pareekshan main hui shahadat se bhi gaharaa aghat laga tha
 Due to this, the plan to get Bhagat Singh released from jail was also in trouble

 Azad urged Pandit Nehru to insist on Gandhi ji asking Lord Irwin to convert the execution of these three into life imprisonment! At Alfred Park, he was chanting by one of his friends Sukhdev Raj, only then the SSP of CID came there from Babur jeep 
 uske peeche-peeche baari sankhya main karnalganj thane se police bhi aa gayi
 Azad received heroism in fierce firing from both sides
 yah dukhad ghatana 27 farvari 1931 ke din ghatit hui or hameshaa ke liye itihaas main darj ho gayi
 The police had performed the last rites of Chandrashekhar Azad without informing anyone

 People started worshiping the tree under which Azad was martyred

 People began to take the soil of the place with clothes in vials

 When the news of Azad's sacrifice came to Jawaharlal Nehru's wife Kamala Nehru, she informed all the Congress leaders and other patriots
 
 Later in the evening, people gathered under the leadership of Purushottam Das Tandon along with Kamla Nehru at the Rasulabad crematorium in Allahabad
 agle din aaazaad kii asthiyaan chunakar yuvakon kaa ek juluus nikaala gaya
 There was so much crowd in this procession that the main roads of Allahabad got jammed

 The rally was followed by a procession

 Kamla Nehru and Purushottam Das Tandon also addressed the gathering
 isse kuch hi din purv 6 farvari 1931 ko pandit motilal nehru ke dehant ke baad azaad bhes badalakar unki shavyatra main shaamil hue the
 Azad Prakhar was a patriot
 kakori kand main faraar hone ke baad se hi unhone chhipane ke liye sadhu kaa vesh bananaa bakhubi sikh liya tha or iskaa upyog unhone kai baar kiya
 Once, to raise money for the party, he also became a disciple with a dying monk of Ghazipur so that after his death, the property of the monastery would be handed over to him
 parantu vahaan jaakar jab unhen pataa chalaa ki sadhu unke pahunchne ke pashchaat maranasann nahin rahaa apitu or adhik hatta-katta hone laga to ve waapas aa gayi
 Almost all the revolutionaries were highly influenced by the revolutionary stories of Russia in those days, they were also free but they were more happy to listen to others than to read themselves
 ek baar dal ke gathan ke liye bombay gayi to vahaan unhone kai filmein bhi dekhin
 Silent films were prevalent at that time, so they were not particularly attracted to films
 chandrasekhar azaad ne veerta kii nai paribhaasha likhi thi
 After his sacrifice, the movement started by him intensified, taking inspiration from him, thousands of youth jumped into the freedom movement
 aaazaad kii shahadat ke solah varshon baad 15 agast san 1947 ko hindustan kii aazaadee kaa unka sapana puraa to hua kintu ve use jite ji dekh na sake
