 purv main is parvatamala kaa ant chini seemaa par hota he
 Sohrai art is a tribal art
 iskaa prachlan hazaribagh jile ke baadam kshetra main aaj se kai varsh purv shuru hua tha
 Specimens of this art can still be seen in the caves of the Isco hills of this region
 kaha jaataa he ki baadam raajaaon ne is kala ko kaaphi protsaahit kiya tha
 Because of which this art was able to get out of the walls of the caves and make its place in the walls of houses
 jharkhandi samskruti main soharai kala kaa mahatv sadiyon se rahaa he
 In the name of so-called modernity in the changing environment, the people's disregard for this art has come as a crisis on its existence
 rajya ke adivasee bahul kshetron main soharai parv ke dauraan desaj dudhi maati se saje gharon kii deevaaron par mahilaon ke haathon ke hunar ab bamushkil se dekhne ko milte hai
 Now the lime has replaced the milk mat
 us samay aisa koi ghar nahin tha jahaan kii mahilaayein is kala se apane gharon-deevaaron ko sajaana nahin jaanati hon
 Today the situation has changed
 ab to iske kalakaar or ise jaananevaale logon kii sankhya ginati main rah gayi he
 One of the few such names is that of Rukmani Devi
 hazaribagh jile ke badakagaanv prakhand kii rahanevaali rukmani kahati he ki yah kala maine apni maa se sikhi thi or maa ne apni maa se
 She says that far from learning this art, people do not even know it
 bakaul rukmani adivasee samskruti main is kala kaa mahatv jivan main unnati se lagaaya gaya tha, tabhi iskaa upyog deepawali or shaadi-vivaah jaise avasaron par kiya jaataa tha
 So that both wealth and dynasty can grow
 rukmani bataati he ki is kala ke peeche ek itihaas chipa he
 Which most people do not even know
 vah bataati hai ki baadam raaj main jab kisi yuvaraj kaa vivaah hota tha or jis kamare main yuvaraj apni navvivaahita se pehali baar miltaa tha us kamare kii deevaaron par yaadgaar ke liye kuch chinh ankit kiye jate the
 These signs were mostly made from white clay, red clay, black soil or cow dung
 is kala main kuch lipi kaa bhi istemaal kiya jaataa tha jise vruddhi mantra kehete the
 In later days, the script was replaced by artifacts
 jisamen phool, pattiyaan evam prakruti se judi chijen shaamil hone lageen
 Over time, these signs came to be known as Sohrai or Kohbar Kala
 dhire-dhire yah kala raajaaon ke gharon se nikalakar puure samaaj main fail gayi
 The kings also helped in bringing this growth art from door to door
 par aaj madad to dur is saanskrithik dharohar ke sangrakshan ke liye bhi koi aage nahin aata
 In such a situation, perhaps no one will be able to save this art from disappearing into the caves of oblivion and the coming generations will find Sohrai in the pages of history itself

 is sandarbh main san 1959 main derida ne prashnad poocha: kya kisi sanrachana kaa udium nahin hona chahie, tathaa kya arambhikta, yaa udgamam bindu, kisi vastu kaa udgasam hone ke liye pehle se hi sanrachit nahin honi chahie? In other words, every mechanism or synchronous process has a history, and structures cannot be understood without understanding their origin
 saath hi, gati sunishchinat karne ke liye aarmabhikta koi vishuddh ekatv athwa saamanyata nahin ho sakati, balki ise pehle se hi aise paribhaashit hona chahie ki isse ek aitihaasik prakriya kaa udgasam ho sake
 This existential complexity should not be considered a fundamental principle, but rather a lack of origin, what Derida calls iterability, maps, or textuality

 The gotras broadly refer to a group of people whose lineage is linked to an original male ancestor in unbroken order
 vyakaran ke prayojanon ke liye panini main gotra kii paribhaasha he 'apatyam pautraprabhrati gotram', arthath 'gotra shabd kaa arth he bete ke bete ke saath shuru hone vaali santan
 Gotra is the noun of a clan or clan according to its original male
 sankshep main kahe to manusmriti ke anusaar saat peedi baad sagaapan khatm ho jaataa horthaat saat peedi baad gotra kaa maan badal jaataa haior aathvi peedi ke purush ke naam se nayaa gotra armbh hota he
 But because of not knowing the exact count of gotra, Hindus are running their gotra in the name of ancestors born millions of years ago, which is causing marital complications
 bharat main hindu vidhi ke mitakshra tathaa daybhag naamak do prasiddh siddhant hai
 Of these, the law of law is prevalent in Bengal and Mitakshara in Punjab and the rest of India
 punjab main isamen rudhigat parivartan ho gaye hai
 According to the Mitakshara method, there are two general categories of blood relations: hindu vidhi ke mitakshra siddhant ke anusaar rakt sambandhiyon ko do saamaanya pravargon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he
 The first category can be called gotriya i
e
 'sapind gotraja'
 gotreey athwa gotraj sapind ve vyakti hai jo kisi vyakti se pitru paksh ke purvajon athwa vanshajon kii ek atoot shrikhala dwaara sambandhit hon
 It is important to maintain the lineage
 udaahranarth, kisi vyakti ke pita, dada or pardada aadi uske gotraj sapind yaa gotreey hai
 Similarly, his son Poutradi is also his Gotriya or Gotraja Sapind, or rather, it is said that Gotraj Sapind is a person who has the same blood circulating in his arteries
 rakt-sambandhiyon ke duusare pravarg ko 'anya gotreey' athwa bhinn gotraj sapind yaa bandhu bhi kehete hai
 Other Gotriya or brothers are those who are related to a person by their maternal side
 udhaaharan ke liye, bhanja athwa bhatiji kaa putr bandhu kehalaayegaa
 Gotriya refers to those people who have blood relations by direct ancestral tradition of ancestors or descendants
 parantu yah vansh parampara kisi bhi ore ananthata tak nahin jaati
 Here only those people are gotra who come within the seventh generation of the same ancestor
 hindu vidhi ke anusaar peedi kii gananaa karne kaa jo vishisht tarika he vah bhi bhinn prakaar kaa he
 Here the person or that person has to count himself as the first generation, in whose case we have to find out whether he is the tribe of a particular person
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi 'k' vah vyakti he jiske purvajon kii hamen gananaa kerani he to 'k' ko ek peedi athwa pratham peedi ke rup main gina jaayga
 His father will come in the second generation and his grandfather in the third generation and this sequence will continue till the seventh generation
 ye sabhi vyakti 'k' ke gotreey honge
 Similarly, we can calculate in the patriarchal order up to the seventh generation of the son Pootradi, ie the great-grandson of the great-grandson of 'A'
 ye sabhi gotraj sapind hai parantu keval itane hi gotraj sapind nahin hai
 Apart from these, till the seventh generation, which includes the father as the first generation, the other male descendants of a person's father i
e
 brother, nephew, nephew's daughter-in-law are also Gotraj Sapind
 isi prakaar kisi vyakti ke dada ke chha: purush vanshaj or pardada ke pita ke chha: purush vanshaj bhi gotraj sapind hai
 We count these six descendants in the order of ancestor until we include the six male descendants of the great-grandfather of 'A'
 is vanshavali main or gotraj sapind bhi sammilit kiye ja sakate hai jaise 'k' kii dharmapatni tathaa putree or uskaa dauhitr
 The wives of the six descendants of the paternal side of 'A' are also Gotraja Sapind even to the wife of his mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and great-grandfather of his great-grandfather
 samyak tathaa sankuchit vaidhik nirvachan ke anusaar, gotraj sapindon kii kul sankhya 57 he
 Those who are beyond the descendants of these ancestors up to the 13th generation of ancestors similar to 'A' will be the 'A'
 inke atirikt 'k' ke pardada ke pardada ke pare pitruparampara ke saat purvaj or us parampara main 41veen peedi tak ke unke vanshaj bhi 'k' ke samaanodak honge
 Equals are those whom 'A' gives water while performing Shraadh
 paratu vyapak drushti se samaanodak bhi gotreey hi hai
 Those whose clans are not known are considered as Kashyapagotriyas

 19 crores 20-40 crores francisi bhashaa ek romance bhashaa he jo vishvabhar main lagbhag 9 karod logon dwaara pratham bhashaa ke rup main boli jaati he
 Most people who originally spoke this language live in France where this language was born
 is bhashaa ko bolne vaale anya kshetra ye hai- adhikansh canada, belgium, switzarland, africa francophone, laczmberg or monako
 The French language is spoken by 19 crore people as a second language and as the language acquired by another 20 crore
 vishwa ke 54 deshon main is bhashaa ko bolne waalon kii acchhee bhalee sankhya he
 French is a language derived from the Latin language of the Roman Empire, such as other national languages - Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Romanian and other minority languages such as Catalan, etc
 is bhashaa ke vikascram main isapar mul roman gul kii caltic bhashaaon or baad ke roman frekish akramanakariyon kii germanek bhashaa kaa prabhaav padaa
 It is an official language in 29 countries, most of which are from a group of French speaking countries called La Francophonie
 yah sayukt raashtra kii sabhi sansthaaon kii or anya bahut se antarrashtriya sanghathanon kii bhi aadhikarik bhashaa he
 According to the European Union, 129 million people from its 27 member nations can speak French, 6
5 million of whom are native speakers and 69 million can speak it as a second language, making it the third most spoken language of the Union after English and German
 Makes a language
 iske atirikt 20 veen shatabdi ke prarambh main angrezi ke adhirohan se pehle, francisi europea or aupniveshik shaktiyon ke madhya kootneeti or samvaad kii pramukh bhashaa thi or saath hi saath europe ke shikshit varg kii bolchaal kii bhashaa bhi thi
 If these consonants come at the end of a word in written French: s, t, f, c, q ,, x, p, n, m, they are not usually pronounced
 isaliye agar vartanee he français, to uskaa uccharan hoga fraanse, na ki frances
 "N" and "M" can make vowels nasal
 anya vyanjan jab shabd ke ant main aate hai to zyaadaatar unka uccharan hota he
 But if someone understands his French pronunciation rules well, he will believe that it has better rules than English

 simon ayog saat british saansdo kaa samooh tha, jiskaa gathan 1927 main bharat main samvidhan sudhaaron ke adhyayan ke liye kiya gaya tha
 It is named after the Simon Commission after its chairman, Sir Joan Simon
 simon kamishan kii report main suzav diya gaya ki- prantiy kshetra main vidhi tathaa vyavastha sahit sabhi kshetron main uttaradaayi sarkaar gathit kii jaae
 It is not yet time for the formation of responsible government at the center
 kendriya vidhaan mandal ko punargathit kiya jaay jisamen ek ikai kii bhaavana ko chhodkar sangheey bhaavana kaa paalan kiya jaay
 Also, its members should be elected indirectly by the provincial legislatures
 kamishan ke sabhi sadsy angrej the jo bharatiyon kaa bahut bada apmaan tha
 After the withdrawal of the non-cooperation movement after the Chauri Chaura incident, the stagnation in the battle of independence was broken by the announcement of the formation of Simon Commission
 1927 main madras main congress kaa adhiveshan hua jisamen sarvasammati se simon kamishan ke bahishkaar kaa faisla liya gaya
 The Muslim League also decided to boycott Simon
 3 farvari 1928 ko kamishan bharat pahunchaa
 Wherever Simon reached Kolkata including Lahore Lucknow, Vijayawada and Pune, he faced fierce opposition and people showed him black flags
 puure desh main simon go back ke naare gunjane lage
 Lathicharge in Lucknow, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was injured and Govind Vallabh Pant was crippled
 30 oktober 1928 ko lala lajpat raay ke netritv main simon kaa virodh kar rahe yuvaaon ko berahami se peeta gaya
 The police brutally lathied Lala Lajpat Rai's chest
 vah buree tarah ghayal ho gaye or marane se pehle unhone bolaa tha ki "aaj mere upar barsi har ek lathi ki chot angrejon kii taabut kii keel banegi" antat: is kaaran 17 november 1928 ko unki mrityu ho gai
 The day was 30 October 1928
 sanvaidhanik sudhaaron kii samiksha evam rapat taiyaar karne ke liye saat sadasyeey simon kamishan lahore pahunchaa
 The deafening slogans of "simon Go Back" were echoing across India
 is kamishan ke saare hi sadsy gore the, ek bhi bhartiya nahin
 The protest against the Simon Commission in Lahore was led by sher-e-punjab Lala Lajpat Rai
 noujvaan bharat sabha ke krantikariyon ne simon virdohi sabha evam pradarshan kaa prabandh sambhala
 Where the commission members were to leave, the crowd was more
 lahore ke police adheekshak scot ne lathicharge kaa aadesh diya or up adheekshak sanders janata par tut padaa
 Bhagat Singh and his comrades witnessed this atrocity, but Lala ji asked to remain calm
 lahore kaa akaash british sarkaar virdohi naaron se gunj rahaa tha or pradarshnakariyon ke sir foot rahe the
 At the same time, Scott himself started beating Lala Lajpat Rai mercilessly with sticks and he was seriously injured
 ant main unhone jansabha main singh garjana kii, mere sharir par jo laathiyaan barasaai gai hai, ve bharat main british shashan ke kafan kii antim keel sabit hongi
 18 days later on 17 November 1928, these sticks became the cause of martyrdom of Lala Lajpat Rai
 bhagat singh or unke mitra krantikariyon kii drushti main yah raashtra kaa apmaan tha, jiskaa pratishodh keval "khun ke badale khun" ke siddhant se liya ja saktaa tha
 Decisive decisions were made on the night of 10 December 1928
 bhagat singh, chandrashekhar aaazaad, raajaguru, sukhdev, jai gopal, durga bhabhi aadi ekatrit hue
 Bhagat Singh said that he should die by my hands
 aaazaad, raajaguru, sukhdev or jayagopal sahit bhagat singh ko yah kaam saunpa gaya
 On 17 December 1928, Deputy Superintendent Sanders exited the office
 use hi scot samajhakar raajaguru ne us par goli chalaai, bhagat singh ne bhi uske sir par goliyaan maarin
 British power trembled
 agle din ek ishtihaar bhi bant gaya, lahore kii deevaaron par chipka diya gaya
 It was written - Hindustan Socialist Republican Association has retaliated by killing Lala Lajpat Rai and then sat in the Kolkata Mail with Veerangana Durga Bhabhi, raising a child in Bhagat Singh's lap
 raajaguru naukaron ke dibbe main tathaa sadhu bane aaazaad kisi anya dibbe main ja baithe
 The heroes of the freedom struggle went ahead to make new history
 kolkata main bhagat singh anek krantikariyon se mili
 Bhagwati Charan was already there
 central assembly main bam phenkane kaa vichaar bhi kolkata main hi bana tha
 The opportunity for this was also found soon
 kendriya assembly main do bill pesh hone vaale the- "jan suraksha bill" or "audyogic vivaad bill" jinka uddeshy desh main uthte yuvak andolan ko kuchalanaa or mazdooron ko hadtaal ke adhikaar se vanchit rakhana tha
 In the meeting of the revolutionaries led by Bhagat Singh and Azad, it was decided that the bombing would take place on 8 April 1929, when the Viceroy's Assembly announced the making of these two resolutions into law
 iske liye shri batukeshwar dutt or vijay kumaar sinha ko chunaa gaya, kintu baad main bhagat singh ne yah kaary dutt ke saath swayan hi karne kaa nirnay liya
 At the same time, when the Viceroy rose to declare anti-indian proposals to make laws, Dutt and Bhagat Singh also stood up
 pehla bam bhagat singh ne or doosraa dutt ne phenkaa or "inkulab jindabad" kaa naaraa lagaaya
 There was uproar, George Schuster hid under his desk
 sargent terry itnaa bhaybheet tha ki vah in donon ko giraftaar nahin kar paaya
 Dutt and Bhagat Singh could have easily escaped, but they were voluntarily held captive
 unhen dilli jail main rakhaa gaya or vahiin mukadmaa bhi chalaa
 After this both were taken to Lahore, but Bhagat Singh was kept in Mianwali Jail
 lahore main sanders kii hatya, assembly main bam dhamaakaa aadi maamle chale or 7 oktober 1930 ko tribunel kaa faisla jail main pahunchaa
 Which was as follows - Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged, Kamal Nath Tiwari, Vijay Kumar Sinha, Jaydev Kapoor, Shiv Verma, Gaya Prasad, Kishore Lal and Mahavir Singh for life, seven years of Kundanlal and three years of rigorous imprisonment for Premadatta
 dutt ko assembly bam cond ke liye umrakaid kaa dand sunaaya gaya

 The internal combustion engine is an engine in which fuel and oxidizer are ignited in a cylindrical combustion chamber closed on all sides
 dahan kii is kriya main praayah hawa hi oxykaarak kaa kaam karti he
 The closed chamber in which combustion takes place is called combustion chamber
 dahan kii yah abhikriya ooshmakshepi hoti he jo ucch taap evam daab vaali gaisen utpann karti he
 These gases circulate by pushing a piston in the combustion chamber
 piston ek connecting rod ke madhyam se ek krank shaft se judaa hota he, is prakaar jab piston neeche kii taraf jaataa he to connecting rod se judi krank shaft ghumne lagati he, is prakaar eendhan kii rasinic urja pehle ooshmiya urja main badalati he or phir ooshmiya urja yantric urja main badal jaati he
 Unlike the internal combustion engine, the working fluid in the exhaust engine is obtained by heating a liquid in another chamber
 praayah pistonyukt pratyaagaamee ingine, jisamen kuch-kuch samyaanterval ke baad dahan hota he, ko hi anterdahan ingine kaha jaataa he kintu jet ingine, adhikansh rocket evam anek gas terbine bhi anterdahan ingine kii shrenee main aati hai jinamein dahan kii kriya anwarat rup se chalati rahati he
 Nowadays most of the engines used in automobiles are internal engines
 antardahan ingine ke avishkaar kaa vichaar madhyayug se prarambh hua
 In 1680, the Dutch scientist Christian Hyges suggested a vertical cylinder and piston engine, in which a piston shot upwards by a gunpowder explosion
 kintu is tarah kaa ingine kabhi kaam main nahin aayaa
 Later, with the invention of combustible gases and mineral oils, his suggestion became practical as the problem of giving fuel instead of gunpowder was solved
 lekin phir bhi is varg ke injanon ko vyaavhaarik upyogita ke anukool banane main anek varsho ke praayegic or saidhantik adhyayan kii aavashyaktaa hui
 Diesel, petrol, alcohol or natural or synthetic gas etc
 are used as fuel in internal combustion engines
 lekin saadhaarant: petrol or dijal kaa hi upyog hota he
 Impedance engines operate on two principles - quadrant cycle and quadratic cycle four stroke ingine main chaaron stroke sakson,compresson,power va agzast kii prakiya purna hoti he
 And power when the piston is up and down twice
 matlab krenkashaft do baar gumti he
 Fuel is saved in the four stroke engine
 antardahan injanon main do jatiyaan hoti hai, ekadish sakriy ingine or ubhaydish sakriy ingine
 In active engines, the working material rests on only one side of the piston; On both sides in amphibious active engines
 unamem silinder lanbaa rahata he or piston ke donon ke bhaagon main chushan, sampeden ityadi hota rahata he
 Most internal engines are activated directly
 udhaahrant:, motorkaron main ingine isi prakaar ke hote hai
 But many large engines are enabled amphibiously
 ekadish sakriy ingine kii apeksha ubhaydish sakriy ingine main lagbhag duguni urja utpann hoti he or naap main nammaatr hi vruddhi hoti parantu ubhaydish sakriy injanon ke nirmaan main kai yantric kathinaaiyaan padati hai
 Therefore, only large boat engines have amphibious active engines
 duusari ore, vaashp ingine or vaayu sampidak saadhaarant: ubhaydish sakriy banaae jate hai, yadhyapi yah anivaary niyam nahin he
 Most of today's combustion engines are built on the principle of Otto cycle
 gananaa kii saralata ke liye ham kalpana kar sakate hai ki chakra main do kriyaayein samentropic or do sthiraayatnik hoti hai
 In order to facilitate the analysis of hypothetical cycles, it is assumed that the working substance is air only
 yah bhi maan liya jaataa he ki na to chushan aghat hota he ore na nikaas aghat
 This analysis is called aerodynamic analysis
 vaastavik ingine main gaison kaa nikaas hota he
 Instead, gases are thought to cool at a constant volume
 kaary utana hi hota he, chaahe gaison kaa nikaas kiya jaae, chaahe unhen thanda kiya jaae prayek dasha main idhan ke jalane se utpann ushma utani hi rahati he
 The rate at which energy is converted into work is called power; This is the amount of work in a unit of time
 vah kaary jo aage peeche chalanevaale piston yukt ingine ke piston par kiya jaataa he, nirdisht karm kehalaata he or nirdisht kaary ke anusaar gananaa kii hui shakti nirdisht ashwashakti kehalaati he
 The amount of work that reaches the engine axis is called axle work or brake work and the power generated according to this work is called brake horsepower
 kisi antardahan ingine ke kitna shakti praapt ho sakati he, ise nirdhaarit karne ke liye kai aadhaar liye ja sakate hai
 Motorcar engine makers in their advertisements state the maximum power of their engine, which is achieved when all conditions are optimally suited
 parantu audyogic ingine kaa nirmaataa apane injanon kii shakti saadhaarant: lagbhag mahattam ushmiya dakshata par utpann honevaali shakti ke anusaar nirdhaarit karte hai
 It is also best to determine the power of industrial engines in this way
 kaaran yah he ki yadi ingine nirdhaarit samarthy par chalaae jaayenge to eendhan kaa kharch nunatam hoga or phir aavashyaktaa hone par kuch samay tak ve adhik samarthy par bhi kaam kar sakenge
 The power received in each internal combustion engine depends on the mass of the fuel-air mixture that enters the cylinder in one run of the piston
 isliye jin kaarnon se yah dravyaman ghatega unase ingine kaa samarthy ghatega
 In the actual engine, there is some impediment to the mixing of the fuel-air-mixing reducing device called resistor, and the intake and exhaust valves
 isliye mishran ko chuusate samay silinder main daab vayumandaleey daab se kam hi rah jaati he
 As a result, the mixture does not penetrate as much as is considered in theoretical calculations
 saidhantik gananaa main to maan liya jaataa he ki silinder ke bheetar mishran kii daab vayumandaleey daab ke baraabar he
 Then, the inner surface of the cylinder, and the mixtures remain relatively hot
 isliye silinder main pahunchne par idhan mishran garam ho jaataa he
 According to the volume heat-pressure law, the mass of the mixture in the cylinder is less than the mass that would have been when it was cold due to the increase in temperature
 phir, vaastavik ingine main silinder ke chhot sthaan main, nikaas ghaat ke purna ho jane par bhi, gaisen aadi vayumandaleey daab se adhik daab par rah jaati hai or chushan ghaat ke aarambh main ve silinder main fail jaati hai
 Suction begins only after their pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure
 isse bhi siddhanthata pariklit maatra se kam hi mishran silinder main pravesh karata he
 Finally, the higher the engine is above sea level, the lower the atmospheric pressure
 isliye dravyaman ke anusaar jitna mishran silinder main samudratal par pravisht ho sakegaa usase kam hi mishran unche sthalon main pravisht ho paaegaa
 The rectangular efficiency of the combustion engine not only decreases with increasing height, it also decreases with increasing engine speed
 isliye daud pratiyogita main prayukt injanon or adhik oonchaai par kaam karanevaale injanon main bahudhaa supercharger laga diya jaataa he
 There is a small centrifugal fan in this device which pushes the fuel-air mixture at a higher pressure of atmospheric pressure in the cylinder
 supercharger lagane se aaytneey dakshata bad jaati he, yahan tak ki yah 1 se adhik bhi ho ja sakati he
 In the analysis of the Otto cycle it has been shown that increasing the compression ratio increases efficiency
 vaastavik injanon main bhi yahi pravriti dikhaai padati he
 In engines operating according to the Otto cycle, the suction shock also carries air as well as fuel, and therefore remains present in compression shock as well
 jab sampeden anupaat bahut bada rakhaa jaataa he to sampeden ke ek niyat maatra se adhik hote hi idhan mishran main adhisphot hota he, arthath idhan swayan, bina spark plag se chinagaari aae, jal uthta he
 Then, even if this does not happen, compression waves arise when the spark plugs start to burn, sparking ahead of the burning mixture near the spark
 in sampeden laharon ke kaaran chinagaari se dur kaa mishran swayan jal uth saktaa he, jo avaanchhneeya he
 Then, the fuel mixture may burn prematurely by burning the charred residue of petrol etc
 somewhere in the cylinder, or by burning the charred residue of petrol, etc
 inside the piston, or by the hot tip of any component inside the piston
 
 jab kabhi sampidit mishran samay se pehle jal uthta he to uskaa yah jalanaa adhisphotak hota he
 It is heard by ear - it seems that a metal is being hit with a hammer
 shighratapurvak jalane vaale idhano main adhisphot kii ashanka adhik rahati he
 There have been many new discoveries in the last few decades, which can keep the compression ratio much larger without being overcorrected
 udhaahrant: Motorcar engines had a compression ratio of about 4
5 in about 1920–25; Sometimes it was 3
5
 vartmaan samay main yah anupaat 6
5 yaa kuch adhik rahata he; kuch injanon main to yah anupaat 10 tak hota he
 The speed of the engines is usually stated in revolutions per minute, but it is not determined how many revolutions per minute the engine is placed in which particular class
 iske atirikt teevrgati vaashp ingine main jitne chakkar prati minute hote hai, ve atyant mandgati antardahan ingine ke chakkar prati minute 4,000 yaa kuch adhik chakkar kaa veg rahata he, parantu daud kii pratiyogita ke liye bane injanon main chakkar prati minute 6,000 ke aasapaas hote hai
 Diesel engines, which have about 1,000 revolutions per minute, are called rapid diesel
 badi naap ke silinderwaale ingine chote silinderonvaale injanon kii apeksha mand gati se chalate hai, kyonki bade piston baari hote hai or unke chalan kii disha badalte samay itnaa jhatka lagata he ki use sanbhaalanaa kathin hota he
 The velocity of the piston also determines the range of motion of the engines, because greatly increasing the velocity of the piston destroys the engine quickly
 motorcar ke injanon main piston-veg ab 2,800 foot prati minute yaa isse bhi kuch adhik rakhaa jaataa he
 The average velocity of a piston in diesel engines is between 1,000 and 1,200 feet per minute
 injanon kii naap silinder ke vyas or piston kii daud se bataai jaati he
 For example, a 12-18 inch engine means that the cylinder has a diameter of 12 inches and the piston races 18 inches
 aadhunik motorcar injanon main apane usee naap ke 20-30 varsh pehle ke purvajon kii apeksha kahin adhik samarthy rahata he
 Strength is increased due to the following reasons: 2 stroke ingine kii kaary pranali Function of 4 stroke engine venkal rotary ingine kii kaary pranali Working System of Venkal Rotary Engine venkal rotary ingine kii aatanrik banaavat Over time displacement of pistons in a four-cylinder engine jet ingine kii sanrachana Pulse Jet Engine Working ganakeey taral yantriki se anumaanit jet ingine ke nikat pravaah kshetra Working of diesel engine dijal chakra, dijal ingine kaa moolbhoot siddhant Venn diagrams are diagrams that show all hypothetically possible logical relationships between finite collections of aggregates
