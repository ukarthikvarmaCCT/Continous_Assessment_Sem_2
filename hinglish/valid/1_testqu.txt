 Star-delta transformation is a mathematical technique that simplifies the analysis of an electrical circuit
 ise Y-delta, vaai-delta, delta-star parivartan, star-mesh parivartan, T-Î  or T-pai parivartan aadi naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 It derives its name from the shape of an electric circuit that resembles the Roman letter y and the Greek letter Î”
 yah paripath parivartan san 1899 main arthur edwin kennedy ne prakashit kiya tha
 In fact, this change establishes equivalence in two three-headed networks
 tulyata ke liye aavashyak he ki dono hi networkon main kinhi do siron ke bich tulya pratibaadha samaan honi chaiye
 The general idea is to compute the impedance r y { \ displaystyle R_ {y}} at a terminal node of the y circuit with impedances r â€² { \ displaystyle r '}, r â€²â€² { \ displaystyle R' '} to adjacent nodes in the Î´ circuit by where r Î´ { \ displaystyle R_{ \ Delta }} are all impedances in the Î´ circuit
 This yields the specific formulae The general idea is to compute an impedance r Î´ { \ displaystyle r _ { \ Delta}} in the Î´ circuit by where r p = r 1 r 2 + r 2 r 3 + r 3 r 1 { \ displaystyle R_{P}=R_{1}R_{2}+R_{2}R_{3}+R_{3}R_{1}} is the sum of the products of all pairs of impedances in the y circuit and r o p p o s i t e { \ displaystyle R_{ \ mathrm {opposite} }} is the impedance of the node in the y circuit which is opposite the edge with r Î´ { \ displaystyle R_{ \ Delta }} 
 The formula for the individual edges are thus In graph theory, the Y-Î” transform means replacing a y subgraph of a graph with the equivalent Î´ subgraph
 The transform preserves the number of edges in a graph, but not the number of vertices or the number of cycles
 Two graphs are said to be Y-Î” equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a series of Y-Î” transforms in either direction
 For example, the Petersen graphs are a Y-Î” equivalence class
 Given the values of r b { \ displaystyle R_{b}}, r c { \ displaystyle R_{c}} and r a { \ displaystyle R_{a}} from the Î´ configuration, we want to obtain the values of r 1 { \ displaystyle R_{1}}, r 2 { \ displaystyle R_{2}} and r 3 { \ displaystyle R_{3}} in the equivalent y configuration
 In order to do that, we will calculate the equivalent impedances of both configurations in N1N2, N1N3 and N2N3, supposing in each case that the omitted node is unconnected, and we will equal both expressions, since the resistance must be the same
 The resistance between N1 and N2 when N3 is not connected in the Î´ configuration is In the y configuration, we have By similar calculations we obtain and The impedances for the y configuration can be derived from these equations by adding two equations and subtracting the third
 For example, adding and, then subtracting yields and hence and Let r t = r a + r b + r c { \ displaystyle r_{t}=r_{a}+r_{b}+r_{c}} 
 We can write the Î´ to y equations as Multiplying the pairs of equations yields and the sum of these equations is Now we divide each side of by r 1 { \ displaystyle R_ {1}}, leaving Using in, we have and by definition of RT { \ displaystyle R_ {T}} which is the equation for r c { \ displaystyle R_{c}} 
 Dividing by r 2 { \ displaystyle R_{2}} and r 3 { \ displaystyle R_{3}} gives the other equations
 Star-delta transformations are used to analyze networks by simplifying them

 sabhi tom and jeri katha-prasangon kii suchi ke liye tom and jeri ankon kii suchi dekhen
 The plot of each short film is usually based on Tom's numerous attempts to capture Jerry and the resulting scuffle and devastation
 kyonki tom kabhi-kabhaar hi jeri ko khaane kaa prayaas karata he or chunki kuch cartoon laghu-filmon main yah jodi vastav main ek duusare ke saath acchhee tarah nibaah karte dikhaai dete hai, isliye yah abhi tak aspasht he ki akhir kyon tom, jeri kaa itnaa adhik peechha karata he
 Some of the reasons presented are general cunning / hatred for rats, duty as ordered by his boss, attempts by Jerry to spoil the tasks assigned to Tom, Jerry eating Tom's owner's food, which is assigned to Tom, a sense of revenge, Jerry's avoidance of Tom's other potential victims, competition with another cat and Tom's clever siren cats
 To attempts to Kane, who does Jerry hatred or jealousy, among other reasons
 jeri kii chaalaaki, dhoort kshamtaayen or qismat kii vajah se tom shaayad hi kabhi jeri ko pakadaney main safal ho paata he
 Interestingly, in many title cards, Tom and Jerry are shown smiling at each other, implying a love-wrangling relationship rather than the sheer annoyance displayed on each other in each cartoon
 cartoonon main aise kai drushtaant hai, jahaan ve sachhee dosti tathaa ek duusare kii bhalaai ke prati chintaa jataate hai 
 Some of the short film's marks are famous for some of the loud jokes invented in theater animations: Jerry's chopping Tom, slamming his head into a window or door, Tom's ax, pistol, explosives, traps, and poison Trying to assassinate Jerry, tuck Tom's tail in waffle iron, push him into the refrigerator, hook his tail into an electric socket, snag him, stick or big hammer Taking it vigorously, dropping it to the ground with a tree or an electric pole, sticking a matchstick in its feet and burning them, etc

 In a recurring joke, Jerry kills Tom when he is thinking, where Tom initially does not feel the pain - and moments later he feels pain and vice versa; In another gag, Jerry stops Tom in the middle of the chase, before Tom can do something, he injures him

aam taur par, samvaad bahut hi kam he, chunki tom or jeri lagbhag kabhi baat hi nahin karte, lekin chote paatro ko is prakaar simit nahin kiya gaya he
 For example, each of the participating issues has dialogues for the character Mammy to Shoes, except The Little Orphan

 Prior to 1954, all Tom and Jerry cartoons were produced in valid Academy proportions and formats; And from late 1954 to 1955 some cartoons were produced in both the Academy format and the widescreensynmascope process
 1956 se lekar, ek saal baad MGM cartoon studio ke band hone tak, sabhi tom and jeri cartoonon kaa nirmaan cinemascope main kiya gaya tha, yahaan tak ki kuch ke soundtrack persepecta directional audio main ricard kiye gaye the

 In the first short film Pus Gets the Boot, Tom was originally called "jasper", while Jerry was named Jinx
 tom bahut jaldi gussa hone vaala or dublaa-patala he jabaki jeri swaavlambee or mauqon kaa faaydaa uthaane vaala he
 In comparison to his size, Jerry possesses amazing powers such as picking up things like anvil quite easily and bearing the bruises from them
 adhik kriyasheel or pakke iraade kaa hone ke baavjood, dimaag or chaturaai main tom kaa jeri se koi muqabla nahin he
 At the end of each cartoon, Jerry usually wins by "missing the pupil" or "fade out", while Tom is shown as a loser
 phir bhi, durlabh avasaron par duusare nattejey bhi saamne aa sakate hai, aam taur par tom tab jeetta he, jab jeri hamalavar hota he yaa vah koi seemaa laangh jaataa he 
 Sometimes, often ironically, the two are defeated, especially when Jerry's last trap of impressing Tom potentially turns him on
 yaa jab jeri khadedate hue ant main kisi chiz ko upekshit kar detaa he
 Sometimes, the two eventually become friends
 donon kirdaar parapidak pravritiyon kaa pradarshan karte hai, jisamen ve ek duusare ko pareshaan karne kaa mazaa uthaate hai
 However, on the basis of the cartoon, whenever one character is threatened with death, Vivek awakens in the other and saves him
 kabhi-kabhi, ve kisi apriy anubhav ke parinamswaroop paraspar bhaawanaaon se jud jate hai or unka ek duusare par waar, gambhir hamale se zyaada sirf ek khel hota he
 Many of the short films have been shown to be quite easily interwoven and when the situation demands, beyond the expectation, they both have the ability to work together, often against another party, who torture them both And manages to degrade them
 ek laghu-film main tom pehle methed se miltaa he or vah tathaa mangi mat, jeri ko pakadaney kaa prayaas karte hai
 But when Tom's devil forces him to hurt Meathead by beheading him instead of Jerry, instead of being beheaded, he inflicts an injury on his head

 The only other common accentuation Tom does is when an external element claims a scenario or probable event to be impossible, which is essentially, ironically to thwart Tom's plans - at which point , Lathera and Shattered Tom appear and the ghostly, echoing says "don't You Believe It!", Which was taken from some of the famous World War II promotional films of the 1940s

 In a 1956 short-film Blue Cat Blues, Jerry narrates the tale in voiceover

 Tom and Jerry: The Movie is the first excerpt from the series, where the famous cat-and-mouse duo regularly interact with both people and other human-like animals; It is possible that Tom and Jerry have the ability to speak, but do not want to use them except for short phrases, preferring to speak to other characters
 jeri ko paqadane ke liye apni koshishon main tom aksar ek maili andheri gali kii billi buch kii dakhlandaazi kaa saamana karata he, jo jeri ko pakad kar khaanaa chaahati he or spike, ek krodhi, dusht paharedaar bulldog he, jo apane bete tike ko pareshaan karne vaale tom par tab hamalaa karata he, jab vah jeri ko pakadaney kii koshish kar rahaa ho
 Often Spike spoke using the voice and gestures of comedian Jimmy Durant
 itane saalon main spike kaa kot bhura or halke gulabi rang main badla he
 The entry of Spike's son Tyke in the late 1940s led to both a slight softening of Spike's character and a temporary new theater series
 jaisaa ki upar kaha gaya he, gali kii ek kaala billaa buch bhi jeri ko pakad kar khaanaa chahta he

 When Mammy was not present, one can sometimes see other people, usually the lower part of the neck

 In the late 1930s William Hanna and Joseph Barbara were members of the Rudolf Ising Unit of MGM Cartoon Studios

 Hanna and Barbara held a competition inside the studio to give the pair a new name, to suggest something different
 Animator John Carr won $ 40 for his suggested Tom and Jerry
 1941 main da midnite snacks ke saath tom and jeri kaa nirmaan shuru ho gaya or hanna tathaa barbara ne MGM main kaarykaal ke dauraan apane billi or chuuhe ke cartoonon ke alaava shaayad hi kisi or kaa nirdesan kiya ho
 Tom's physical appearance evolved over the years
 1940 dashak ke prarambh main, tom kii ruparekha main kai vivaran shaamil the-jhabarila far, chehre par anek jhurriyaan, ekaadhik bhunhon ke chihn - jinhen 1940 ke dashak ke ant tak adhik vyaavhaarik rup main suvyavasthit kiya gaya or vah ek asli billi kii tarah dikhaai dene laga; apane is choupayon kii shuruuaat ke alaava tom badhate-badhate or antat lagbhag dopyon vaala ban gaya
 In contrast, Jerry's design was basically the same throughout the series
 1940 dashak ke madhya tak, shrinkhalaa ne 1942 main MGM cartoon studio main shaamil hokar kaam karne vaale tex evari kii prerana se ek teevr, adhik urjavan lehza apanaaya
 Although the plot of each short film is virtually the same - where the cat chases the mouse - Hannah Barbara eventually made several changes to the theme

 yahaan tak ki 1950 dashak main jab bajet kam hota gaya or laghu-filmon kii gati kuch dhimi ho gai, tab bhi tom and jeri apane theatre main mul pradarshan ke dauraan lokapriy rahe
 But, after television became popular in the 1950s, box office revenues of films and shorts appearing in theaters declined
 Prior to this, MGM attempted to grapple with the complete cinemascope production of the series
 baad main jab MGM ko ehsaas hua ki unke dwaara dubaara pradarshit puraani laghu-filmon se aay, nai filmon ke baraabar hi thi, to studio ke karypalkon ne anemation studio ko band karne kaa nirnay liya, jisane karmchaariyon ko aashcharya main daal diya
 In 1957, MGM Cartoon Studio was closed and the last of the 49 Tom and Jerry short films by Hanna and Barbara appeared on Taut Watchers on 1 August 1958
 hanna or barbara ne 1957 main khud kaa television anemeshan studio, hanna barbara productions, sthapit kiya, jisane aage jaakar mashhoor TV sho or filmein banaain
 In 1960, MGM decided to produce new Tom and Jerry shorts, and producer William L
 An agreement was signed between Cinder and animation director Jean Deich and his studio Rembrandt Films to produce films in Prague, Czechoslovakia
 The Ditch / Cinder team made 13 short films, many of which had surrealist qualities
 chunki dich / cinder dal ne tom and jeri kii mul laghu-filmein bahut hi kam dekhi thim, parinamtah bani filmein chalan ke viruddh or kai myanon main betuki maani gayi
 The characters' gestures were often displayed at a fast pace, causing their moves to appear very blurred

soundtrack main viral sangeet, rikt dhwani prabhaav or samvaad, jo bolne kii jagah adhiktar fusfusaaye gaye the or gunj kaa adhik prayog kiya gaya tha
 The first of Jean Deitch's short films, Switching Kitten, had indiscriminate pictorial errors, framed mistakes and incisive, somber music and sound effects that made the short-film virtually non-watchable
 These problems were never solved, and it is still widely regarded as an extremely useless Tom and Jerry short
 tom ke prashansakon ne jeri dwaara tom se kabhi bhaybheet na hone ke kaaran, dich ke cartoonon kii aalochana kii
 Mostly, Tom tries to hurt him only when he comes in his way
 tom kaa nayaa maalik, ek sthulkaay shwaat purush tha, jise maimi shoes ke tulana main tom kii galtiyon ko dandit karne main zyada krur dikhaaya gaya tha, jaise ki tom ko baar-baar peetna or danda se maarna, uske chehre ko gril se bhednaa or tom ko carbonated peya pine ke liye majaboor karnaa
 Surprisingly, the Tom and Jerry cartoons of Jeanne Ditch are still being shown on a semi-regular basis today

 1963 main shuru karte hue jones or goldman ne 34 se adhik tom and jeri laghu-filmon kaa nirmaan kiya, jin sab main jones kii vishisht style dekhne ko mili
 But, despite the same artists working with Jones at Warners who produced the animations, the critical success of these new short films remained in diverse categories
 jones ko apni style ke tom and jeri hasya qism ko apnaane main pareshaani hui or kai cartoonon main kathavstu kii apeksha mudraaen, vyaktitv or style ko tarjeeh mili

 Some of Jones's Tom and Jerry cartoons are reminiscent of his work with Wael E
 Coyote and The Road Runner, including the use of unconsciousness, in addition to the gags of characters falling from a height

 When Tom and Jerry were screened on terrestrial television in the United Kingdom, the cartoons were not edited due to the violence and allowed Mamie to remain
 In addition to being on a regular schedule, Tom and Jerry had another way of BBC Whenever the schedules started to deteriorate, the BBC would inevitably turn to Tom and Jerry to fill the vacancy, with the belief that it would otherwise flow to other channels This was particularly helpful in 1993, when the Knowles House party was postponed to the BBC Television Center over fears of an IRA bomb and in turn to fill the gap until the next show

 Rabindranath Shrivastava was a philosopher and manic of Hindi
 pro rabindranath shrivastav kaa janm 9 july 1936 ko uttar pradesh ke baliya jile main hua
 His primary education took place in the village itself
 ve vastutah vigyaan ke vidhyaarthee the
 But he made his move towards literature
 sahitya se unki ruchi bhashavigyaan kii ore badi
 He received his doctorate in Linguistics from the University of Leningrad
 phir unhone california se post doctoret kiya
 He gave a wide view in the perspective of Indian languages to the thinking in various international traditions
 unhone apane gambhir lekhan evam vaicharikta se bhartiya bhashavigyaan ke sampurna paridrishy ko badal daalaa
 Prof
 Srivastava was a man of versatility
 ve karmath, jigyaasu, sahaj vinamr, anushasanpriya, mitbhaashi or jaagruk bhashaa adhyeta the
 He was a man without kinship for those who knew him closely and recognized him
 unke vyaktitv ke bare main spasht karte hue unki ardhangini dow binaa shrivastav ne ek sthaan par kaha he - "unka vyaktitv atyant jeevant tha
 He was completely 'full of life'
 jahaan pahonchte jaise roshni ho jaati
 No serious person would be prepared to consider him at home
 unki ruchi bahumukhi thi
 He loved cinema, television, picnics, picnics, etc
 " 
 pro shrivastav manushyon ke bich koi bhed bhav sweekaar nahin karte the
 Perhaps that's why he used to address his students by putting 'G'
 pro shrivastav ne bhashaa or bhashavigyaan ke vividh pakshon par nirantar chintan-manan kiya
 He moved forward with diverse disciplines of applied linguistics such as phonetics, theoretical linguistics, stylology, sociolinguistics, translation science, language teaching and computational linguistics
 itnaa hi nahin unhone bhartiya sandarbh main bhashaa ko centre main rakhkar sahitya, samskruti, shiksha or sampreshan ke bahuvidh tathaa bahuaiami pakshon par kai prakhyat pustaken likhin
 He wrote many poems during his student life
 apane lekhan ke praarambhik kaal main unhone kavy, kahani or aalochana ko apana kshetra maanakar sahitya srijan kiya
 After returning from Russia as a linguist, he fostered the tendency to associate Hindi linguistics with modern philological thought and wrote several original books in this regard, writing hundreds of articles - both in Hindi and English
 kai pustakon kaa sampadan bhi kiya
 If, in the words of Prof
 Dilip Singh, "his entire writing is a clean shining reflection of his linguistic mind
" unke lekhan ke saath chalanaa purv or pashchim ke bhashachintan kii sadhi rajju par chalanaa he, apni sampurna sajag chetana ke saath
 It is not easy to measure the depth of his writing without this consciousness
 " 
 They also point out that "they have either accepted or expressed their views against it after examining Western linguistics
" unhone teesri duniya kii bhashaai sthiti ko bhi saamne rakhaa
 In this direction, his articles published in English, Hindi and Russian languages are milestones
 unke lekh acostic dhvanivigyaan, saidhantik bhashavigyaan, samajabhashavigyaan, shailivigyaan, anya bhashaa shikshan, sakshartaa, computational linguisticks, prajnak swanim vigyaan tathaa sanket vigyaan se sambhddha hai
 The study of these articles acquaint us with the periphery of their thinking and their gradual development
 " 
 Prof
 Srivastava pondered the various aspects of language and linguistics in his books and articles
 unhone hameshaa bhashaa ko pratik vyavastha mana tathaa bhartiya bahubhashikta ko bahubhashi evam bahusaanskrithik samaaj kii sahaj sampreshan vyavastha ke rup main pramanit kiya he
 He believes that "language has a deep connection with society and that is why it is tied to the destiny of being venomous
" bhashaa vastutah prayojanasiddh shaileyon ke samucchy kaa doosraa naam he
 The different styles of a language remain either in a state of harmony or in a state of tension
 saamanjasy kii sthiti shaileyon ko prayojan se bandhti hai or tanaav kii sthiti unamem pratispardhaa kaa kaaran banati he
 Language is not only a reflection of a person's cognitive perception, but also a mirror in the denomination in which the foundational styles also reflect a picture of their relationship with other charged styles
 isliye bhashavaigyanikon kaa yah daayitv he ki kisi bhashaa ke vyakaran ke bheetar ve shailibhed sambandhi char-sanyukt upaniyamon kii vayavastha ko bhi sameten
 "
 rabindranath shrivastav bhashaa ko keval vyakaran nahin maanate balki usase kahin badi cheez maanate hai
 He states that "hindi is not just grammar nor is it merely a specific linguistic structure
 bhashaa ke rup main vah ek saamaajik sanstha bhi he, samskruti ke rup main saamaajik pratik bhi he or sahitya ke rup main vah ek jaateey parampara bhi he
 "
 ve bhartiya sandarbh main bhashaa ke sthaan par bhashaai samudaay kii charchaa karnaa adhik samichin maanate hai
 Hence they say that "the meaning of language is communication, meaning business and social is the power that binds all the people of a community to a unit by bringing them closer to each other on the ground of emotion, thinking and life-vision
" is ikai ko ham â€˜bhashaai samudaayâ€™ kii sangya dete hai
 a linguistic community is the name of an institutional group of individuals who may be monolingual or multilingual but whose members use equally linguistic symbols in their communication system and in their social behavior when choosing a language, dialect, or style
 If the basis of his election is the same
 


atah is â€˜bhashaai samudaayâ€™ ke liye aavashyak he ki There should be equality in the communication system of its members is sampreshan vyavastha ke madhyam se uske sadsy ek-duusare ke saath na keval vichaar-vinimay karne main samarth hon balki isi aadhaar par aapas main saamaajik drushti se bandhe bhi hon, The basis of knowledge or attitude regarding the choice of languages, dialects or styles used in the communication system is synonymous, is samandharmee gyaan or manovriti ke aadhaar par anya bhashaai samudaay se ve alag yaa vishisht hon, It should have a pattern of an accused language or style on the basis of which its members identify their ethnic identity
 vastutah pro shrivastav ne hindi ke prashn ko bhartiya saanskrithik evam saamaajik prashn se jodakar dekhne kii aavashyaktaa ko rekhaankit karte hue kehete hai, "ham apni saamaajik asmita ko pahachaanen or is sandarbh main bhashaai asmita ke sawaal par ek baar phir gaur karen
 If hindi-urdu language is one for the general public, that is why it does not accept the artificial division created at the educational level
 vah hindi or urdu kii apni mul sanrachana, prakruti or niyamon ke aadhaar par bhashaa kaa prayog karti he
 And from this point of view, Hindi and Urdu are one language, one language

 In the interview Monkey claimed: "bryan ne vastav main haal hi main hamase sampark kiya or band main waapas aane kii ichha jataai
 or hamaare liye


 yah sahi samay nahin tha
 We are doing well and it is like that
 

 yah usee tarah he jaise aap apni patni ko talaak de den or vah aage chali gai or safal hui or uskaa karier nikharaa or phir aap waapas jate hai or, 'he bhagwaan, vah abhi bhi mast he
 "honey, can we be back together?" 'wait 


 everything is divided and it is like that
 

 ' main ise abhi hote nahin dekh rahaa hum
 philhal aisa nahin hone vaala he
 " iske fouran baad, welsh ne apane mispes ke madhyam se bayaan par apni pratikriya vyakt kii or daavon ko nakaarte hue kaha: "I recently came to know of an interview given by Monkey in which he said that i went to Korn and asked that i be taken back into the band
 This is definitely not a complete and correct picture
 puraa sach yah he ki, kareeb ek saal tak, jab se jonathan ne saarvajanik rup se kaha ki vah mujhe corn main waapas chahta he, corn ke prabandhak, mere prabandhak se mujhe corn main waapas laane ke kaam ko aage badhaane kaa anurodh kar rahe the
 Calling started by Corn's managers, not my manager
 i have turned down their requests several times through my manager over the past several months
 haalanki, europe main corn ke pichley daure ke dauraan fieldi ne mujhe vyaktigat rup se bulaayaa or hamane lambey samay tak doston kii tarah baat kii
 He also told me that if i ever wanted to join Corny again or perform as a solo artist in Corny, the door is always open
 chunki fieldi ab shant he or meri tarah ek isai he, maine sochaa ki fieldi se milanaa ek acha vichaar ho saktaa he, vah meraa ek dost he or yah jaanane ke liye vah kya chahta tha or maamla kya tha
 It was fantastic to meet again with Fieldi
 main mukhya rup se uske ghar, ek puraane dost se milane kii ichha se gaya
 The corn case we talked about was secondary, but it was discussed
 fieldi ne sochaa ki jonathan, manki or main, ham sabhi ko doston kii haisiyat se milanaa chahie; judna chahie; or shaayad sambhaavnaaon par charchaa kerani chahie
 Jonathan and Monkey both denied the visit
 fieldi ke saath milakar maine bahut kuch siikhaa
 maine janaa ki main apane doston ko chahta hum or unhen yaad karata hum, lekin us mulaaqaat ne is baat kii pushti kii ki jivan main meraa rasta alag he or sangeet yaa peshewar rup se judaav ab sambhav nahin
 As far as Monkey's comment that "everything is already divided" is also not correct
 vastav main, janvari 2005 se, jab se maine corn choda or agle 4 saal tak, corn mujhe un record ke liye roylty dene main vifal rahaa jo maine unke saath kiya tha
 However, i agree that this was not done intentionally
 ham dhiraj se kaam le rahe hai or vittiya muddon hal karne kii koshish main unke prabandhan ke saath kaam kar rahe hai taaki "sab kuch vaise hi baanta ja sake jaisaa hamane apane anubandh main kaaphi pehle sweekaar kiya tha
 "I am optimistic that we can solve it like friends
 main abhi bhi corn ko apni shubhakamanaayen detaa hum, jisamen vahaan ke mere sabhi mitra shaamil hai - fieldi, jonathan or manki
" a few weeks later, Jonathan, in reference to Korn's early albums, said in an interview with pulsoffradio: "main abhi aapke saamne sab rakhata hum: sara lekhan fieldi or manki dwaara kiya gaya tha
 Head was not really there for anyone, because he was so immersed in drugs and was more concerned about other things
 to corn kaa centre vahaan he
 David was there to write Beats, but he wasn't really there
 or re ko drum vadak ke rup re jodna - use drum bajaanaa pasand he or vah bilkul david jaisaa bajaata he
 We were excited that we found someone who fit in that mold
 to mujhe lagata he ki hamen ve teen mil gaye jo corn kaa centre hai

 But they can also be serious like water
 andhvishwaason ko achche tathaa bure andhvishwaason main baanta ja saktaa he
 Lemon is considered auspicious in North India and Pakistan and is used in many disciplines
 neembu or mirch ke geth-bandhan nae gharon or dukaano ke dwaar par lagaaya jaataa he
 It is believed that by doing this, it removes evil spirits and bad omen
 is geth-bandhan kaa naam nazar-battu he or isme 7 mirch or 1 neembu kaa prayog hota he
 Nazar Battu is changed daily, weekly or fortnightly
 bharat main koi bhi anushthan yaa shaadi main ek rupay dene kaa prachlan he
 One rupee and giving in total is considered auspicious
 iske kai kaaran he
 Some believe that it sparkles, for some it is the love and blessings of elders, and for some it is equal to the beginning of new life
 kuch esa bhi maanate he ki ek rupay badhaane se kul kaa bhaag karnaa kathin ho jayega
 If not increased then two equal parts of the total can be made and it is considered inauspicious
 isliye, khaskar vyah ke gharon main ye kaaphi prachlit he
 It is believed that throwing coins in the river gives success
 aaj bhi yah bharat ke kaafii jagahon par pramanit he
 The reason for this is that in the old times the coins were of brass
 pital pani ko svachh kar detaa he or kitanu maar daalata he
 At that time, drinking water was available from the rivers only
 to nadiyon main sikke daalane se pani svachh miltaa, or hamaare sharir main bhi thodaa pital jaataa
 Therefore, it is said that putting coins in the river is auspicious
 kintu aaj ke sikke steneles steel se bane he
 They have no effect in the river
 ye ab sirf ek andhvishwaas ban rah gaya he
 When water falls, something good is going to happen, people believe it or they can say that it is their superstition
 kaha jaataa he kii koi vyakti ke jane ke baad agar pani girte he yaa giraaya jaataa he to us vyakti kaa yatra achhaa jaataa he or agar vah vyakti koi kaam ke liye bahaar niklaa he to uskaa kaam kismat uskaa saath degi
 This is done either when a child goes to take an exam or when a person goes to find a job
 yah mana jaataa he kii pani girnaa yaa pani kaa bahna shubh hota he or sab kuch aaraam se chalata he koi baadha nahin hoti
 Shubh Yatra Whenever someone goes out in the world, they are called auspicious journey, it is not enough in India that if during the journey, if a person sees a dead person carrying it, then his journey will be lost, or see elephant
 Or see a cow and a calf together, eat yogurt before starting the journey, or see your face in water, then their journey or work will be successful and successful
 kehete he kii jab bhi kuch nayaa liya jaataa he uskaa puja yaa bhagwaan kaa naam le kar hi shuru kiya jaataa he
 Whenever people take a new house or a new vehicle, they worship for it and they break the coconut in front of it and throw the coconut down with a lot of joints so that it becomes broken
 logo kaa yah maananaa he kii aisa karne se vah us chiz ko aapane maanane lagate he
 One of the many superstitions in India says that we should not clean the house after the sun sets
 esa karnaa hamaare jivan main durbhaagya laaegaa
 It is believed that by doing this, we are removing luck from our lives
 lekin is andhvishwaas ke peeche ek kaaran he
 In earlier times lighting systems were not good
 safai karne ke samay kuch chota gira ho to dhul ke saath bhul se use bhi phenk diya jaataa
 Because of this, there was a fear of losing valuables
 anya kaaran yah he ki jhaadu ke tukade deepak par gir sakate the, jisse aag kaa khatra paidaa hota
 These reasons led to this superstition
 hindu dharm grantho or bhartiya puraano ke anusaar naag ko kabhi rakshak ke rup main dekha jaataa he, to kabhi vidhvansak ke rup main
 They are also worshiped in many areas of the country
 hindu puraano ke aadhaar naag ko kai jaadooi shaktiyon kaa vardaan hota he or isliye inaki puja kii jaati he
 Some believe that snakes drink milk, there is a diamond or Nagamani on their forehead, and if they are harmed, they never forget
 esa mana jaataa he ki naag ke paas nagamani hoti he, parantu naag ke mastak par kabhi kuch rakhaa nahi ja saktaa
 This superstition is prevalent only due to Hindu mythology
 kuch sanskritiyon main ise shubh mana jaataa he or kuch main apshagun
 In India, it is considered a bad omen, especially before any auspicious work
 angreji main ek kahawat he ki kaanch todne par saat saal kii asafalataa kaanch todane vaale ko milegi
 It is also believed that if the glass falls and breaks on its own, someone is sure to die in that house
 isaki kaafii vivaran he
 Some people believe that the mirror has the power to constrain our soul
 isiilie uskaa tootna kaa matlab he hamaara aatma se alag hona
 Over time this belief turned into a superstition of glass
 ek or vivaran yah he ki pehle kaanch bahut mahangaa tha, isiliye bacchon ko usase dur rakhane ke liye aisi kahaniyaan banaai gai ho
 It may also happen that such rumors have been spread so that no one gets hurt by the broken glass
 kaafii logo kaa maananaa he ki 13 ashubh ank he
 It is one of the most considered superstitions
 party main 13 logo k hona, ghar yaa gaadi kaa number 13 hona, ye sab apshagun he
 Some buildings have no thirteenth garland
 baarah ke baad sidhaa 14 hota he
 There is no reason for this
 isa maseehaa ke aakhri khaane par unako milakar 13 log the, or un main se ek unka vishwasghatak niklaa
 Apart from this, there have been many accidents on the thirteenth day of the month, due to which this superstition became even deeper
 lekin yah sirf ittfak he
 There is no scientific reason for this
 13 ank se bhi zyaada ashubh shuukravaar ko mana jaataa he jo maheene ke terahave din ko aata he
 When someone is going out of the house, interrupt him by asking him that he is being said is a bad omen
 aisa karne se jis kaam ke liye baahar janaa tha wo kharaab ho jayega
 Due to this belief, elders in India always tell that never leave anyone while leaving home
 ghar se nikalne se pehle chhikna bhi apshagun mana jaataa he
 It is said that once you get lost, you should sit and drink water or else the work will be spoiled
 lekin agar 2 baar chhike to aisa kuch nahin hoga
 Everyone must have heard that nail biting is not good at night
 is andhvishwaas ke peeche yah kaaran he ki naakun kaatane ke baad safaai karte samay kuch keemtee saamaan kooday main ja saktaa he
 At the same time there was a lot of power problems earlier, then at night, nails can fall and you can bite the feet
 is vajah se yah andhvishwaas saamne aayaa
 Apart from this, it is also believed not to cut nails on Tuesday and Saturday
 iske peeche koi vivaran nahin he
 There is a lot of superstition associated with solar eclipse
 suryagrahan ko bahut hi karaab mana jaataa he
 The solar eclipse says that people should not get out
 is samaaye bhagwaan kaa ghar or dukaane bhi band ho jate he
 At that time there is no food in the house and no food is eaten
 suryagrahan ke samaye agar koi nanha sa baccha jaanam letaa he to use manahuus mana jaataa he
 suryagrahan khatm hone par kehete he kii logo ko naha dho ke hi koi kaam karnaa chahie
 Peepal tree is also widely accepted in India and abroad
 kaha jaataa he kii pipal ke ped main vishnu, shani, hanuman tathah anya bhagavaano kaa vaas he
 Due to this reason people do not bat under the peepal tree but worship the tree
 pipal ped pe log kumkum or haldi puja karne par lagaate he or aurate ped ke chaaro fir dhaagaa baandhti he
 The peepal tree gives us oxygen
 kuch logo kaa yah bhi kahana he kii jaha bhagwaan kaa vaas hota he, waha bure kaa bhi vaas hota he
 It is said that people should not go under or around the Peepal tree after dusk, because it is believed that the ghost of the Peepal tree is inhabited at that time
 to jis tarah se ham pipal ke ped ko maanate he utana hi usase darate he
