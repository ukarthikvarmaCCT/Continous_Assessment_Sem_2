 pracheen kaal main kaashi main suryabhaan naamak raja hue the, jinhen vriddhavastha main aapng ladki ke rup main ek santan hui
 The king summoned the knowledge of past and future and asked about his past birth

 Muhammad bin Tughlaq was the ruler of the Tughlaq dynasty in the Delhi Sultanate
 gayasuddin tululaq kii mrityu ke baad uskaa putr 'june khaan', mohammad bin tululaq ke naam se dilli kii gaddi par baitha
 Its original name was 'ulugh Khan'
 rajamundari ke ek abhilekh main mohammad tululaq ko duniya kaa khan kaha gaya he
 Probably Muhammad Tughlaq was the most educated, learned and qualified person among all the sultans of medieval times
 apni sanak bhari yojanaon, krur-krityon evam duusare ke sukh-dukh ke prati upeksha kaa bhav rakhane ke kaaran ise 'swapnsheel', 'pagal' evam 'rakt-pipaasu' kaha gaya he
 Sultans have been declared unrighteous by historians like Barani, Sirhindi, Nizamuddin, Badauni and Farishta
 singhaasana par baithne ke baad tululaq ne amiron evam saradaaron ko vibhinn oopaadhiyaan evam pad pradaan kiya
 He gave the title of 'bahram Khan' to Tatar Khan, the title of 'imad-ul-mulk' to Malik Qabool and 'wazir-e-mumalik', but later he got the title of Gujarat with the title of 'khane Jahan'
 Was created usne malik aruyaaj ko khwaja jahaan kii oopaadhi ke saath ‘shahana-e-imaarat’ kaa pad, moulana gayasuddin ko 'kutulug khaan' kii oopaadhi ke saath 'vakil-e-dar' kii padavi, apane chachere bhai firoj shah tululaq ko 'naayab barbak' kaa pad pradaan kiya tha
 Muhammad bin Tughlaq was one of the most intelligent, intelligent, religious, fair-minded, art-loving and experienced commander among all the Sultans of Delhi
 vah arabi bhashaa evam farsi bhashaa kaa viddhan tathaa khagolashastra, darshan, ganit, chikitsa, vigyaan, tarkshastra aadi main paarangat tha
 Like Alauddin Khilji, at the beginning of his reign, he neither accepted his position from the Caliph nor took the support of the Ulema class, though it had to do so later

 Qazi's decision with which he was not satisfied changed it
 sarvapratham mohammad tululaq ne hi bina kisi bhedbhaav ke yogyata ke aadhaar par padon kaa aavanton kiya
 Adopted a policy of appointing officers on the basis of merit by eliminating race and class discrimination
 vastut: yah us shaasha kaa durbhaagya tha ki, uski yojanaayen safaltaapurvak kriyanvit nahin hui
 Due to which it became the subject of criticism from historians
 mohammad tululaq ke singhaasana par baithte samay dilli sultanate kul 23 praanton main banta thi, jinamein mukhya the - dilli, devgiri, lahore, multan, sarmuti, gujarat, avadh, kannauj, lakhanauti, bihar, malwa, jajanagar, dwarasamudr aadi
 Kashmir and Balochistan were also included in the Delhi Sultanate
 dilli sultanate kii seemaa kaa sarvaadhik vistaar isi ke shasankaal main hua tha
 But due to its cruel policy, rebellion started in the state
 jiske falswaroop dakshin main nae swatantra rajya kii sthapana hui or ye kshetra dilli sultanate se alag ho gaye
 Bengal also became independent
 rajarohan ke baad mohammad tululaq ne kuch naveen yojanaon kaa nirmaan kar unhen kriyanvit karne kaa praytn kiya
 like - apni pratham yojana ke dwaara mohammad tululaq ne doaab ke upjaau pradesh main kar kii vruddhi kar di, parantu usee varsh doaab main bhayankar akaal pad gaya, jisase paidaavaar prabhavit hui
 The rebellion in the area led to a rebellion by the Tughlaq officials, which failed the Tughlaq's plan
 mohammad tululaq ne krishi ke vikaas ke liye ‘diwan-e- amir kohi’ naamak ek naveen vibhaag kii sthapana kii
 Due to corruption of government employees, indifference of farmers, lack of good land, etc
, after three years, their plan for agricultural progress was terminated
 mohammad bin tululaq ne kisaanon ko bahut kam byaaj par rin uplabdh karaayaa
 Tughlaq shifted the capital from Delhi to Devgiri under his second plan
 devgiri ko “kuvvatul islam” bhi kaha gaya
 Sultan Qutubuddin Mubarak Khilji named Devagiri as 'qutbabad' and Muhammad bin Tughlaq changed its name to Daulatabad
 sultan kii is yojana ke liye sarvaadhik aalochana kii gai
 There is a great controversy among historians on the reasons for the change of capital by Muhammad Tughlaq, yet it can be concluded that, Devagiri is situated in the center of Delhi Sultanate, safe from the fear of Mongol invaders, such a stretch towards prosperity of South India etc
 There were reasons why the Sultan thought of changing the capital
 mohammad tululaq kii yah yojana bhi purnatah asafal rahi or usne 1335 i
 main daulatabad se logon ko dilli waapas aane kii anumati de di
 The change of capital resulted in the development of Muslim culture in the South, which eventually opened the way for the rise of the Bahmani Empire
 anubhav maury Under the third plan, Muhammad Tughlaq introduced symbolic and symbolic coins
 sikke sambandhi vividh prayogon ke kaaran hi edward tamas ne use ‘dhanavaanon kaa rajkumaar’ kaha he
 Muhammad Tughlaq introduced the coin named 'dokani'
 barani ke anusaar sambhavtah sultan ne rajkosh kii riktata ke kaaran evam apni samrajya vistaar kii niti ko safal banane hetu sankethik mudra kaa prachlan karavaaya
 Under the sign currency, the sultan probably introduced coins of brass and copper metals, which were worth the rupee of silver
 sikaa dhaalane par rajya kaa niyantran nahin rahane se anek jaali taksaal ban gayi
 Lagaan was given out with fake coins, which caused the economy to collapse
 sankethik mudra chalaane kii prerana china tathaa iran se mili
 The rulers there carried out these schemes successfully, while Muhammad Tughlaq's experiment failed
 sultan ko apni is yojana kii asafalataa par bhayanak aarthik kshati kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Under the fourth plan, the Khurasan and Karachil conquests of Muhammad Tughlaq are mentioned
 khurasana ko jeetne ke liye mohammad tululaq ne 3,70,000 sainikon kii vishaal sena ko ek varsh kaa agrim vetan de diya, parantu raajnneetik parivartan ke kaaran donon deshon ke madhya samjhauta ho gaya, jisase sultan kii yah yojana asafal rahi or use aarthik rup se haani uthaani padi
 Under the Karachil campaign, the Sultan sent a large army under the leadership of Khusro Malik to conquer the hill states
 uski puri sena junglee raaston main bhatak gai, ebn batuta ke anusaar antatah keval das adhikari hi bachakar waapas aa sake
 Thus this plan of Muhammad Tughlaq also failed
 sambhavtah 1328-29 i
 ke madhya mongol akramanakari tarmasharin chaghtai ne ek vishaal sena ke saath bharat par akraman kar multan, lahore se lekar dilli tak ke pradeshon ko rond daalaa
 It is believed that Sultan Muhammad Tughluq returned the bribe to the Mongol leader
 It is also believed that the Mongol leader bribed the Sultan to undermine the status of the Delhi Sultan himself and similarly for the Mongol rule
 Granted
 unke bich jo bhi hua, mongol netaa ke prati is samajhote kii niti ke kaaran sultan ko aalochana kaa shikaar bananaa padaa
 It is true that after this, there was never a Mongol invasion of India during the time of Muhammad Tughluq and that because of his ambitious failed plans, Muhammad Tughluq is called the 'king of failures'
 mohammad bin tululaq ke shashan kaal main sabase adhik vidroh hue, jinamein se 27 vidroh akele dakshin bharat main hi hue

 Mahatma Gandhi has not created any new philosophy, but the philosophical basis of his ideas is the same Gandhi philosophy
 ishwar kii satta main vishwaas karanevaale bhartiya aastik ke upar jis prakaar ke darshanik sanskaar apni chhap daalate hai waisi hi chhap gandhi ji ke vichaaron par padi hui he
 He leads by revealing his faith in some of the fundamental philosophical elements of India and from that all his ideology flows
 kisi gambhir rahasyavaad main na padakar ve yah maan lete hai ki shivamay, satyamay or chinmay ishwar sristi kaa mul he or usne sristi kii rachana kisi prayojan se kii he
 He was born in a country that has accepted the intact and immortal power of the living soul
 ve us desh main paidaa hue jisamen jivan, jagat sristi or prakruti ke mul main ekmaatr avinshwar chetan kaa darshan kiya gaya he or sari sristi kii prakriya ko bhi saprayojan sweekaar kiya gaya he
 Although he has not written anything vivid and orderly about any interpretation or esotericism of this type of philosophy, his study of his ideas gives an idea of the above vision
 unka vah prasiddh vaakya he-- jis prakaar main kisi sthool padaarth ko apane saamne dekhtaa hoon usee prakaar mujhe jagat ke mul main ram ke darshan hote hai
 Once he had said, in light of darkness and in death, the renewable power of life is distinguished
 yahan unhen jivan or jagat kaa prayojan dikhaai detaa he
 They say that the creation of life and creation of the world has been done with auspicious and inauspicious roots and conscious
 is rachana kaa prayojan yah he ki asaty par satya kii or ashubh par shubh kii vijay ho
 They believe that the visible physical part of the world is as true as it is and even more true than that is not a visible consciousness, whose consciousness is life
 falat: ve yah vi·sa karte hai ki manushya main jahaan ashubh vrittiyaan hai vahiin uske hriday main shubh kaa nivas he
 If it has animalism, then divinity is also distinguished
 sristi kaa prayojan yah he ki usamen devatv kaa prabodhan ho or pashutaa pratadit ho, shubhansh jaagrit ho or ashubh kaa paraabhav ho
 Whatever is inauspicious in their eyes, it is ugly, it is unrestrained, it is untrue, it is all immoral
 jo shubh he, jo satya he, jo shubhr he vah naitik he
 The same truth, the same Shiva and the beautiful
 jo sundar he use shivamay or sanamay hona chahie
 He has believed that man has always been giving prominence to his body, his enjoyment, his selfishness, his ego, his stomach and his reproduction
 par jahaan ye pravritiyaan manushya main hai, jinase vah prabhavit hota rahata he, vahiin usee manushya ke utsarg or tyaag, prem or udaartaa, ni:swaarthta tathaa vyashti ko samshti main lay karke, ahambhaav kaa sarvatha tyaag karke viraat main lay ho jane kii daivi bhaavana bhi vartmaan he
 The expression and elevation of these expressions is the means of the victory of the god over the demon

 In the light of this, Mahatma Gandhi saw the development of the entire creation and the history of humans
 unka darshan ek prakaar se jivan, maanav samaaj or jagat kaa naitik bhashya he
 His non-violence has arisen from this womb
 unki ahimsa pracheen kaal se santon or mahatmaon kii ahimsa maatr nahin he
 His non-violence is pronounced in a word form in which all his vision is full
 vah maanate hai ki jagat main jo kuch aniatik he vah sab hinsa he
 Selfishness, arrogance, gluttony, arrogance, tendency to indulgence, exploitation for satiety, sovereignty and authority and the tendency to think of themselves as the claimants of all pleasures, possessions and splendor and prosperity, in their eyes, are the animalism which human beings Animalism leads to inhumanity and immorality
 unki ahimsa keval adarsh tak hi parimit nahin he
 They also see it as a powerful tool for the attainment of the goal
 ahimsa ko pashutaa ke viru ddh vidroh ke rup main prastut karne or use ajey tathaa amogh shakti ke rup main pratishthit karne main gandhi ji kii pratibha apni abhootpurv abhinavtaa pradarshit karti he
 Their non-violence is not limited only to non-violence, but wherever there is violence, injustice, animalism, they go on to fight against it
 anyaay or aniti ke sanmukh mastak jhukaana paap he
 Do not patronize animalism
 Do not bow down in front of animalism, do not face evil and animalism through immorality and animalism because that will be the triumph of animalism
 pashutaa par devatv kii vijay tab hogi jab naitik or shubh astron se aniatik or daanav bhav kii paraajay ho
 Weapons cannot be defeated with arms, violence with violence, anger with anger
 unki ahimsa niskriy nahin sakriy he
 It is not organized for the cowardly escapist or for those who are afraid of weapons, to present a path of escape
 vah veerta, dridhtaa, sankalp or dhairya ko aadhaar banaakar khadi hoti he jo anyaay or anachar ko, jagat kii sari shastrshakti ko or dwesh tathaa dambh se adheer hui shashanyatta kii sari damanaatmak pravriti ko chunauti detii he
 Non-cooperation and satyagah were born from this thought of his
 yahi unki hinsak kranti, raktahin viplav or hinsahin yuddh kaa moort rup he
 Ahimsa in his eyes is the immense power which can never be defeated
 sashastr vidroh se kahin adhik shakti ahimsak vidroh main he
 No power, empire or power can be able to pulverize the soul of a non-violent hero with the help of arms
 ahimsa naitikta par ashrith he, at: satya he or satya hi sadaa vijayi hoga
 Thus he created a bright, noble and moral path in front of the world in the form of non-violence
 jisane manushyasamaj or jagat ko gatisheel hone kii prerana pradaan kii
 They are the counter-views of all beliefs, assumptions and visions which are based on materialism
 ve pratik hai un samast bhaavon ke jo manushya ko pashutaa kii ore nahin, devatv kii ore badhane kii disha kaa sanket karte hai
 By displaying this non-violent path, they imagine to reach a goal where the system of life, its society and its world can be created on the basis of non-violence
 ve maanate hai ki manushya parivartit kiya ja saktaa he or uskaa vikaas shubhratha kii ore ho saktaa he
 They also believe that under the rule: Man is good and oriented towards good
 ve samajhate he ki vyakti se samaaj banataa he or vyakti kaa parivartan samaaj ko parivartit kar degaa
 They also believe that a changed society will create rites for the person that will lead to the emergence of new culture
 ahimsa ke aadhaar par samaaj kii rachana kis prakaar ho sakati he isaki sari kalpana unke charakhe main pratishthit he
 They accept that the economic system has the greatest impact on the individual and society and then the economic and social beliefs that arise from it give rise to the political system
 aaj padaarthon ke utpaadan kii pranali vaigyanik yantravaad ke kaaran kendrit ho gai he or vahi aadhunik vishwa kii samast samasyaon ke mul main baithi hui he
 a concentrated system of production gives rise to centralized capital, resulting in the economic and social system in the hands of a few individuals of the society
 uski raksha ke liye shakti tathaa adhikaar or prabhuta ko kendribhoot karne ke liye mahati or kendrikrut shastrshakti ke aadhaar par raajnneetik satta asana jamaati he
 The result is exploitation, exploitation and pulsing of a large part of society
 is prakaar adhikarvanchit or shoshit jansamaj aarthik, saamaajik or raajnneetik drushti se mulat: paradheen hota he yadhyapi dekhne main swadhin dikhaai detaa he
 It means that the system will operate by resorting to arms and illiteracy, human oppression by humans is inevitable
 is samasya kaa hal ahimsak samaaj kii rachana he or us samaaj kii rachana vikendrikaran ke aadhaar par kii ja sakati he
 The system of production should be decentralized, the means of production decentralized, capital should be decentralized, society should be self-reliant in the achievement of essential substances for life
 use ki si kaa mukhpekshi na bananaa pade
 He could enjoy his own earnings and thus the society formed on the basis of decentralized production and capital should not become a means of self-interest of any class
 phir jab puunji vikendrit hogi or samaaj kii ikaiyaan swaavlambee banengi tab shastrshakti se sampann kisi kendriya raajnneetik satta kii aavashyaktaa na rahegi or vah avasthaa hogi jab maanav maanav ke daman, dalan or dohan se muktahokar sachhee swatantraaa kaa upbhog karnaa
 The spinning wheel will be freed from that exploitation and consume true freedom
 charkha usee vikendrikaran ke siddhant kaa pratik he
 He is a symbol of the creation of a non-violent society
 vah chunauti detaa he aadhunik vishwa kii saamaajik vyavasthaaon, dharanaon or manyataon ko
 Mahatma Gandhi considered it necessary to focus on more than the means
 unka kahana tha ki yadi saadhy pavitra or maanviya he to saadhan bhi vaisaa hi shuddh, vaisaa hi punit or vaisaa hi maanviya hona chahie
 We see that it has been their practice to emphasize the social purity of means and means and take shelter of them
 unke in moulik vichaaron ne maanav samaaj ke vikaas ke itihaas main ek atyant ujwal ore pavitra adhyay kii rachana kii he
 In Gandhiji, the emergence of the ideals displayed by the development of humanity from Yuga Yuga appears only in a concise form, in which Lord Krishna's dignity of Lord Rama, compassion of Buddha, love of Jesus are seen simultaneously

 jabaki khud bharat ek dharmanirpeksh rajya he, puure bharat main hinduon kii tulana main musalmaan raajnneetik, saanskrithik or aarthik rup se haashie par hai
 Because of this, Muslims believe that they are not residents of India and they alienated the Kashmiri people

 grey line ke prastaavit stesan nimna hai: Temperature is the measure of the heat of an object
 arthath, taapmaana se yah pataa chalata he ki koi vastu thandhi he yaa garm
 For example, if the temperature of one object is 20 degrees and that of another object is 40 degrees, then it can be said that the second object is warmer than the first object
 ek anya udhaaharan - yadi bangalore main, 4 agast 2006 kaa ausat taapmaana 29 degree tha or 5 agast kaa taapmaana 32 degree; to bangalore, 5 agast 2006 ko, 4 agast 2006 kii apeksha adhik garm tha
 Based on the evolution of the molecular theory of gases, it is assumed that the temperature of an object is proportional to the average kinetic energy contained in the random motion of its microscopic particles

 If the temperature of a single object is f on the Fahrenheit scale, c on the Celsius scale, k on the Kelvin scale and r on the Roemer scale, then these scales have such a relation - uparokt sarini ko nimnlikhit saral sutara ke rup main bhi diya ja saktaa he- Politics gateway 1962 kaa pakistani samvidhan ek kanoonee dastavej tha, jise june 1962 main lagu kiya gaya tha
 It was Pakistan's highest law code from June 1962 to March 1969
 1956 ke samvidhan kii tarah ise 1969 main nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 It was eventually replaced by the 1973 Constitution, which is still in force
 1950 main bharat main samvidhan ke parvartan ke baad, pakistan ke saansadon ne apane samvidhan ko gathit karne ke prayaas tej kar die
 Prime Minister Mohammad Ali and his government officials worked with the support of opposition parties in the country to prepare a constitution for Pakistan

 By constitution, Iskandar Mirza assumed the office of president, but due to his continued unconstitutional involvement in national affairs, the four elected Prime Ministers were dismissed in just two years
 janata ke dabaav ke tahat, raashtrapati iskundar mirza ne 1958 main takhtapalat ko vaid tehraaya; or is prakaar yah samvidhan lagbhag nilambit ho gaya
 Shortly afterwards General Ayub Khan deposed Iskandar Mirza and declared himself President
 or isliye is yah samvidhan keval 3 saal ke liye hi chal paaya
 On 17 February 1960, Ayub Khan appointed a commission to report on the future political structure of the country

 It had five programs and 250 articles published
 2) drudh samvidhanyah ek drudh samvidhan tha, or keval ek vishesh prakriya ke madhyam se hi sanshodhan kiya ja saktaa he
 Amendments to the constitution were passed by at least two-thirds majority of the Parliament, and thereafter, this amendment could become part of the law only after certification by the President

 They were empowered to promulgate ordinances and vetoes against laws that could only be disabled by a two / thirds majority of the National Assembly
 haalanki, raashtrapati ne apane karyaalay kii laagat ko chhodkar vidhayika bhang karne kaa adhikaar nahin tha
 10) Ban on the President The President was not allowed to hold any office of profit in the service of Pakistan, but it was not prevented from holding private property by the management
 11) islamic kanoonkoi bhi kanoon quran or sunnat ke shikshan ke khilaaf paarit nahin kiya jayega or maujuuda kanoonon kaa islamickaran kiya jayega

 The word 'theravada' means 'talk of the noblest'
 buddha dharm kii is shakha main pali bhashaa main likhe hue pracheen tripitak dharmik granthon kaa paalan karne par bal diya jaataa he
 Theravada followers say that they believe Buddhism as its core
 inke liye mahatma buddha ek mahapurush avashya hai lekin koi devtaa nahin
 They do not worship them nor do Buddha-worship occur in their religious ceremonies
 jahaan mahayan buddha paramparaon main devi-devataaon jaise bahut se divya jeevon ko mana jaataa he vahaan therwaad buddha paramparaon main aisi kisi hasti ko nahin puja jaataa
 The Theravists believe that every human being has to find the path of nirvana by himself
 in samudaayon main yuvakon ke bhikshuk banane ko bahut shubh mana jaataa he or yahan yah rivaayat bhi he ki yuvak kuch dinon ke liye bhikshu banakar phir grihasth main laut jaataa he

 Thousands of such Bodhisattvas are worshiped in the Mahayana branch and they have deity-like status in this sect
 in bodhisattvon main kuch bahut prasiddh hai, udhaaharan ke liye awalokiteshwar, amitabh, maitrey, manjushri or kshitigarbha
 The Mahayana branch is practiced in North Asian regions, such as China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Tibet, Bhutan, Mongolia and Singapore
