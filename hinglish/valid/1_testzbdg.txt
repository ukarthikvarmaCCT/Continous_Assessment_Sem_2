 a closed watershed or inclusive watershed is a geography called a watershed area in which rain or melting ice water collects and stops at a lake, marshy area or dry area instead of flowing into the sea or ocean through a river
 aam taur par jo bhi pani dharti par barish yaa himpat ke kaaran padataa he wo nadiyon, nehron or jharanon ke dwaara oonche ilaakon se nichle ilaakon kii ore bahata he
 These moving groups of water keep converging with each other until a single big river is formed
 phir yah nadi aage chalakar kisi sagar main mil jaati he
 But in areas which are isolated from the seas due to slopes, mountains or deserts, the water stops at the lowest place
 aise sthanon par yaa to jhilein ban jaati hai yaa dharti pani ko sokh leti he
 Some of the largest lakes in the world have some lakes formed due to such closed watersheds, such as the Aral Sea and the Caspian Sea
 angrezi main band jalsambar ko "endorheik basin" kaha jaataa he
 Geographically it is seen that the closed watershed areas are often also desert areas
 aisa isliye he ke agar pani ek hi sthaan par ikkatha hone se uski maatra badhati hi jaae to antat pani apane or samudr ke bich kii rukawat ko parajeet kar hi detaa he
 Scientists speculate that at some time Krishna Sagar was such a closed watershed lake which broke its boundaries due to rising water and got into the Mediterranean Sea
 khule jalsambharon main jo namak or anya padaarth milte rahete hai ve aage chalakar sagar main bah jate hai
 This does not happen in closed watersheds
 pani main mili namak or anya padaarth in jhiilon yaa shushk kshetron main jaakar jamaa hoten rahete hai
 Hence the closed Jalasambhar lakes become very saline over time
 bharat ke rajasthan rajya main ajmer ke paas sthit sambar jhil thik aise hi band jalsambar kii ek khaari jhil he
 Pollution on such lakes also has a very bad effect because the pollutants continue to collect and grow instead of dispersing into the sea

 At some places, the water flows only in one season or after flowing for some yoga, the geographical conditions change and stop coming
 aise shushk jhil vaale ilaaqon main namak kii moti or sakht parat jamkar ek vistrut samtal maidan bana detii he jo milon-koson tak failaa hota he

 These lakes shrink during the dry season and increase due to rains or snowfall
 kabhi-kabhi jab pani kam hota he to ek jhil kai choti jhiilon main bat jaati he or phir barishon ke baad pani badhane par milakar phir ek badi jhil ban jaati he
 If economic growth in an area is accompanied by water-resistant dams or canals for irrigation that reduce the flow of water into closed watershed lakes, these lakes often shrink and become very small

 Again, GDP measures output through expenditure; If the chandelier generated was domestically purchased, it would have been included in the GDP figures when it was purchased by a consumer or business, but because it was exported to give the domestically generated amount It is necessary to "fix" the amount consumed domestically

 Arthur Llewellyn Basham was a famous historian, Indologist and author of many books

 Basham, who was born and raised in England, is known for his extremely popular and classical work The Wonder That Was India: a Survey of Culture of Indian Subcontinent before the Coming of the Muslims, written primarily on the culture of ancient India
 itihaas-lekhan main vastunishthata ke pairokaar basham ne kisi aitihaasik nirnay par pahunchne ke purv itihaaskaar ke liye aavashyak drushti par prakaash daalate hue apane ek lekh main sujhaayaa he ki apni abhidharana siddh karne ke liye itihaaskaar ko bade paimaane par sroton kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 But at the same time, he should also avoid the role of a barrister whose only purpose is to decide in his favor
 basham har aisi baat par bal dene ke paksh main nahin the jo itihaaskaar ke tark ko majboot banaati ho yaa sarvaadhik sakaaratmak alok main isaki vyakhya karti ho
 Nor did they try to circumvent all the evidence from the other side

 This example can be seen in the excellent translation of Sanskrit, Pali and Tamil quotes by Basham and his affection for different languages and poems

 This was the first research conducted on Ajivikas and is equally relevant today
 isamen basham ne baudhon or brahmanvaadi rachanaaon ke anveshan dwaara aajeevikon ke bare main strot jamaa kiye
 Their problem was that till then no texts were available to tell the history of Ajivika sect
 aajeevik bhautikwaad ke prachaarak hone ke saath-saath baudhon or brahmanvaadiyon ke pratidwandvi bhi the
 The rival sect had to carefully prepare and analyze such sources between Buddhists and Brahmins on the basis of which the creation of the history of Ajivikas was possible
 basham ke is anusandhan ke kaaran hi aajeevakon ko pracheen bharat ke itihaas main uchit sthaan mil sakaa

 In the third scene, both the disciples return to the Mahant
 narayan das kuch nahin laata he jabaki gobardhan das dhai ser mithai lekar aata he
 The Mahant becomes alert after hearing the news of Guni and Avaguni getting the same sentiment in the city and asks his disciples to leave the city immediately

 When a genetics study was done on wolves and dogs, it was found that the breed of dogs originated from wolves, that is, tens of thousands of years ago ancient humans domesticated some wolves that triggered the descent of dogs
 bhediye ek nar or ek maadaa ke pariwaron main rahete hai jisamen unke bachche bhi palate hai
 It has also been observed that sometimes male or female wolves of a family of wolves take refuge in orphan children of other wolves as well

 unhone yah bhi kaha ki kabhi-kabhi aisi paristhitiyaan ban jaati hai jab bhinn vastuon ko in sabhi-ayaamon kaa anubhav alag-alag prathit ho
 The relation of time and time comes so much in our daily behavior that it is natural to have some incomplete but strong beliefs about them since childhood
 kaviyon ne dik or kaal kii gambhir, vishaal tathaa sundar kalpanaaon kaa varnan kiya he
 In philosophy and western psychology, there has been a thought about them since ancient times
 kanad ke vaisheshik darshan main akaash, dik or kaal kii dharanaayen suspasht di gai hai or inke gunon kaa bhi varnan kiya gaya he
 There is definitely a relation between time and time in the knowledge gained from sensory experiences
 is gyaan kii yadi vaastaviktaa samajha jaae to dik or kaal vastaviktaa se alag nahin ho sakate
 Each philosophical sect has given its own conceptions of reality, problem and time, their interrelations, which do not have consensus
 ganit main bhi dik or kaal kaa apratyaksh reeti se sambandh aata he
 Therefore, the development of prestigious physics depended on these assumptions
 bhautikee ke kuch praayogic fal jab in dharanaon se visangat dikhaai dene lage, tab ye dharanaayen vichlit hone lageen evam aapekshitawaad ne dik or kaal kaa nayaa swaroop sthapit kiya, jo anek prayogon dwaara pramanit or falat: ab sarvasammat ho chukaa he
 This new form of problem and time is not only different but also very difficult to understand, because the use of specific mathematics is necessary in its rendering
 at: jahaan-jahaan dik tathaa kaal sambandh aata he uskaa spashtikaran pehle sthool drushti se, tatpashchaat sookshm drushti se or ant main bhautikee kii drushti se karnaa adhik saral hoga
 Different types of problems can be considered by the suffixes of problem properties from sensory experiences
 anubhavon ke buddhi par jo parinaam hote hai unka pruthakkaran karke dharanaayen banati hai
 In this way, the perception of problems caused by self-experience is called "self-problem" or "personal problem"
 indriyajanya anubhavon main anek anubhav samast vyaktiyon ke liye samaan hote hai or aise anubhav jis ghatana se milte hai, use "vastav' kaha jaataa he
 The perception of "reality" is formed from communities of real events
 indriyon se drushti, sparsh, dhwani, ras or gandh ke anubhav milte hai, kintu ye anubhav sarvada vishwaas ke yogya hote hai, aisa nahin he
 Optical illusions are well known
 sparsh ke bhi sambhram vyavhaar main nity prathit hote hai, jaise do daanton ke bich kii khoh jeebh ko jitani lagati he usase kam choti ungali ko lagati he
 Often this is the case with all kinds of sensory experiences
 at: in apurna anubhavon se vyaktigat dik kii jo dharna banati he vah bhramamoolak hi hoti he
 With the help of measuring instruments and other appropriate instruments, limited subsistence of the senses can be increased and thus many events can be confused
 prayogon main maapan karke dik kii jo dharna hoti he use "bhautik dik kaha jaataa he
 Measurement scales are used for measurement
 anubhavon main dik kaa sambandh chaar prakaar se aata he or in chaaron prakaaron par vichaar karke dik ke gunon kii vyaavhaarik kalpanaayen banati hai
 When the object is directed to the site of an object, a form of the problem is conceived and it is also believed that the existence of the problem is independent
 kisi vastu ke sthal kaa nirdesh anya vastu ke "saapeksh' karne par dik kii "saapeksh sthiti' main doosraa swaroop dikhi detaa he
 The third form of a problem resembles the "shape" of objects, from which the divisibility of the problem can also be imagined
 akaash kii ore dekhne se dik kii "vishalata' kaa chauthaa swaroop dikhaai detaa he
 It is from these four types of forms that practical assumptions are often made regarding problems and the qualities of problems are also informed
 ghatnaon se praapt indriyajanya anubhavon kaa vichar kiya jaae to unke do prakaar hote hai
 Difference of events leads to imagery of problems and their sequence of imagery leads to time
 is prakaar dik or kaal hamaari vichaardhaara main sandigdh rup se pravesh karte hai
 The same period as the problem is also personal and each person's census is free and arbitrary
 itnaa hi nahin, is swa-kaal kii gananaa main bhi parivartan hota he or vah vyakti ke swasthya, avasthaa ityadi sthitiyon par nirbhar karata he, jaise, kisi kaary main manushya magn ho to kaal teji se katataa he
 Therefore, personal or self-time is not trustworthy
 kisi prakritik ghatana se - din or raat se - jo kaal kaa maapan hoga vah vyaktigat nahin rahegaa or sab logon ke liye samaan hoga
 Hence, such a period is called public period
 din or raat kaal ke sthool vibhaag hai
 If their small portions are done, then they are more suitable for time-lapse in practice
 isliye prahar, ghatika, pal vipal athwa ghanta, minute, second ityadi vibhaag kiye gaye
 Generally, time is measured by clock
 dik kii bhanti kaal ke bhi chaar swaroop vyavhaar main dikhaai dete hai
 "when?" From an event or experience
 The question is present and is equated with the problematic "where"
 is kalpana se kaal kaa astitv swatantra samajha jaataa he
 The relative form of time is seen when describing another event relative to the time period
 do ghatnaon ke bich ke kaal se kaal kaa jo swaroop dikhaai detaa he vah dik ke aakaar se samaan he
 Similarly, with the adjectives of timeless, infinite etc
, the vastness of time is shown
 dik tathaa kaal ke chaaron swaroopon ko, yaa gunon ko kahie, milakar vichaar karne par inke vishay main hamaari jo dharanaayen banati hai unako "swa' yaa "vyaktigat' athwa "manovaigyanik' dik or kaal kaha jaataa he
 To give definitions to the concepts of problems and times, a means of measuring them is necessary
 dik ke maapan ke liye drudh padaarthon ke dand, aujaar tathaa yantra upyog main laae jate hai
 These instruments measure the properties of objects such as length, angle, area, volume, etc
 in maapnon ke samay bindu, rekha, samtal ityadi kii dharanaayen banati jaati hai
 When these assumptions are strengthened by many iterations, then the location of the point, line, plane, etc
 is fundamental and the material objects are removed from these assumptions
 ab in dharanaon kii or eucalidia jyamiti kii moulik dharanaon kii samanta spasht hogi
 The notion of a problem involving measurement of fixed objects, or the measurement of objects, is called geometric or euclideal problem
 yah spasht he ki dik kii is dharna se uske jo gun samajhe jate hai ve keval eucalidia jyamiti kii paribhaashaon, swayansiddh or kalpanaaon ke upar hi nirbhar hote hai
 Our practical perception of problems and this geometric notion, determined by measurement, are the form of our macro vision and micro vision respectively
 eucalidia jyamiti par nirdhaarit dik kii yah dharna yadhyapi swaabhaavik dikhaai detii hogi, tathaapi iskaa vishleshan karne kii aavashyata he
 In Euclidean geometry some definitions and some axiomatic facts are given and they have been developed logically
 ye dharanaayen keval kaalpanik or swatantra hai
 With a little consideration it will be clear that Euclidean geometry has no real relation to objects of behavior
 apni mul kalpanaaon ko viksit karte samay unka paraspar tarksangat sambandh rakhana or ek "kaalpanik' ganit shaastra kaa nirmaan karnaa, itnaa hi is jyamiti kaa mul uddeshy tha
 This geometry was extremely successful in this purpose
 is jyamiti kaa or bhi vistaar karke use "vyaavhaarik' banane ke liye "adarsh drudh vastu' kii paribhaasha yah he ki iske do binduon kaa antar kisi bhi paristhiti main utana hi rahata he
 The use of measuring pen or other tools depends on this feature
 vastut: is prakaar "adarsh drudh vastu' ko samavisht karne par eucalidia jyamiti kaa swaroop badal jaataa he or usko ab ham bhautikee kaa ek vibhaag samaj sakate hai
 But in practice this change of Euclidean geometry is not seen from this point of view
 maapan karne par vyaavhaarik vastuon ke maapan ke liye eucalidia jyamiti ke siddhant yatharth dikhaai dete hai
 So Euclidean geometry came to be considered "real"
 vyaavhaarik anubhav or eucalidia jyamiti kaa drushti se newton ne apni dik or kaal kii dharanaayen nishchit rup se prastut kii or pratishthit bhautikee kaa vikaas praaia: vartmaan shatabdi ke prarambh tak inhen dharanaon par nirbhar rahaa
 Newton considered the problem to be independent power and also gave it its merits
 newton ke anusaar dik ke gun sarv dishaao main tathaa sarv binduon par samaan hi hote hai, arthath dik samadik, samang tathaa ek samaan he
 Therefore, the properties of substances are the same at all places in the problem
 dik anant he or newton ke dik main lambaai, kaal tathaa gati se abaadhit rahati he
 Newton has given his belief about the period, and this notion was also according to the development of physics of that time
 newton ke anusaar kaal bhi ek swatantra satta he
 The special quality of Kaal is that it "flows" continuously and everywhere at the same speed and no situation has any consequence on it
 kaal bhi anant he
 In summary, according to Newton both pain and time are independent and absolute entities
 newton aadi kii yantriki inhen dharanaon par nirbhar thi
 In mechanics, both speed and acceleration, both of these had to be fixed in time and time, and at that time there were no errors in these assumptions
 vaise hi bhautikee main newton kaa itnaa prabhaav tha ki in dharanaon par shankaa pradarshit karnaa sambhav nahin tha
 Mathematicians such as Bolaiye, Lobatchevsky, Reiman, etc
, proved that euclidean geometries can be formed if some transformations of Euclidean geometry are appropriate
 yadhyapi aeuclidia jyamitiyon ke anek siddhant eucalidia jyamiti ke siddhanton se bhinn hote hai, tathaapi ve ayogy nahin hote hai
 In particular Reiman's Euclidean Geometry made it clear that Euclidean Geometry is not the only fundamental one
 yadhyapi aeuclidia jyamitiyaan kalpana karne main kathin hoti hai, tathaapi tarksmmat hone se unke fal atyant rochak tathaa upyukt hote hai
 The imagery of the curvature of the problem was particularly suitable for the imagery of problems of more than three anomalies

 kintu hindai swarajya sthapana kii shuru ke din hone ke kaaran or pita punyashlok chhatrapati shri shivaji maharaj ke aadesh ke paalan hetu keval 9 saal ke umr main hi itnaa jimmedaari kaa lekin apmaan janak kaary unhone dhiraj se kiya
 He wrote the three Sanskrit texts Buddhabhushan, Nakhshikh, Nayikabheda and Sathataka in only 14 years of his age
 punyashlok chhatrapati shri shivaji maharaj ke rajbhishek or hindu swarajya ke baad sthapit ashtapradhan mantrimandal main se kuch logon kii raajkaaran ke vajah se yah samvedansheel yuvaraj kaaphi kshatigrast hue the
 Despite being mighty, he was kept away from many battles
 swabhaavat: samvedansheel rahanevaale sambhaji raaje unke pita shivaji maharaj ji ke ajna anusaar mughaalo ko ja mili taaki ve unhe gumraah kar sake
 Because at that time Maratha army had returned from Digvijay in the south direction and they needed time to get excited again
 isaliye mughaalo ko gumraah karane ke liye punyashlok chhatrapati shri shivaji maharaj ji ne hi unhe bhej tha vah ek rajtantr tha
 Later, Chhatrapati Shri Shivaji Maharaj Ji freed him from the Mughals
 magar is prayaas main wo patni rani durgabai or bahen godavari unako apane saath len main asafal rahe
 After the death of Punyashlok Chhatrapati Shivaji Shri Maharaj, some people tried to thrice Anuj Rajaram of Dharmaveer student father Shri Sambhaji Maharaj
 kintu senapati mohite ke rahete yah karsthan naakaamayaab hua or 10 janvari 1681 ko sambhaji maharaj kaa vidhiwat rajbhishek hua
 In the same year, the rebellious son of Aurangzeb, Akbar, fled south and took shelter of Dharmaveer student Sambhaji Maharaj
 akele mogul, portuguese, angrez tathaa anya shatruon ke saath ladane ke saath hi unhen antargat shatruonse bhi ladanaa padaa
 Rajaram Samarthakone, who failed to make Rajaram as Chhatrapati, wrote a letter requesting Aurangzeb's son Akbar to invade the kingdom and make it a mark of the Mughal Empire
 kintu dharmaveer chhatrapati shri sambhaji maharaj ke parakram se parichit or unka ashrith hone ke kaaran akbar ne vah patr chhatrapati sambhaji ko bhej diya
 Enraged by this treason, Chhatrapati Srisambhaji Maharaj gave death sentence to his feudatories
 tathaapi un main se ek balaji aavji naamak samant kii samadhi bhi unhone banaayin jinke maafi kaa patr chhatrapati sambhaji ko un samant ke mrityu pashchaat mila
 In 1683 he defeated the Portuguese
 isi samay vah kisi rajkeey kaaran se sangameshwar main rahe the
 The day he was about to leave for Rayagada, on the same day some gramasthas wanted to accuse him of his problem
 jiske chalate chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj ne apane saath keval 200 sainik rakh ke baaki sena ko raigarh bhej diya
 At the same time, one of his friends, whom he had refused to give, was sent by Mughal chieftain Mukarb Khan with an army of 5000 by secret route
 yah vah rasta tha jo sirf maraathon ko pataa tha
 Therefore Sambhaji Maharaj never felt that the enemy could come from this
 unhone ladane kaa prayaas kiya kintu itani badi fuj ke saamne 200 sainikon kaa pratikaar kaam kar na paaya or apane mitra tathaa ekmaatr salaahkaar kavikalash ke saath vah bandi bana liye gaye 
 Aurangzeb got the tongue of both of them, threw his eyes out
 11 march 1689 hindu navvarsh din ko donon ke sharir ke tukde kar ke aurangzeb ne hatya kar di
 But it is said that before the murder Aurangzeb told Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj that if one of my 4 sons was like you, then the whole of Hindustan would have been merged in the Mughal Sultanate
 jab chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj ke tukde tulapur kii nadi main phenken gaye to us kinare rahane vaale logon ne wo ikaitha kar ke sila ke jod die jis ke uparaant unka vidhipurvak antyasanskaar kiya
 Aurangzeb thought that the Marathi empire would end with the death of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj
 chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj ke hatya kii vajah se saare maratha ek saath aakar ladane lage
 Therefore Aurangzeb had to die in the Deccan itself
 uskaa dakkhan jeetne kaa sapana isi bhoomi main dafan ho gaya
 Despite being such a courageous and good ruler, due to less knowledge, his character is shown as a characterless and addictive king
 yah kaaphi achambhe kii baat he ke chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj ke bare main likhi gayi bate ye unke mrityu ke pashchaat 100 saal guzarane par likhi gayi, sambhaji maharaj or aurangzeb kaa sangharsh satta kaa sangharsh tha
 This sacrifice of Shri Sambhaji Maharaj, Dharmveer student, and the work of tormenting them, the Mughals kept on moving for a month at the behest of Aurangzeb and tortured them all the time and finally killed him by breaking his legs from neck to neck
 Before all this happened, Krurkarma and Dharmandha Aurang had asked them to renounce their Hindu religion and adopt the Muslim religion of the Mughals, but the son of the erstwhile Hindu king Chhatrapati Sri Shivajiraj and keep full devotion and devotion to his Hindu religion
