 Britain intended that this union would soon become an independent state and thus it was fulfilling the demands of independence of all the territories of the region

 The legal basis for this federation was the British Caribbean Union Act 1956 and the date of formation - 3 January 1958 - was established by an order-in-council announced in 1957

 pehle sangheey chunaav kii taiyaar ke liye, sthaneey raajnneetik dalon ke parisangh ke rup main do mahasangheey-vyapak partiyon ko yojit kiya gaya
 Both were organized by Jamaican leaders: the Federal Labor Party of the West Indies by Norman Manley and the Democratic Labor Party by Alexander Bustamante
 vyapak sandarbh main, dabluelpi, puure sangh main shahari aadhaarit partiyon se bana tha, jabaki dlapi main gramin aadhaarit partiyaan shaamil thim
 a small third party, the Federal Democratic Party, was founded in November 1957 by a group in Trinidad, although the party failed to win a single seat
 donon pramukh rashtriya dalon ke liye kai minon main platform samaan the
 Both advocated maintaining and strengthening ties with the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada: the emphasis on encouraging and expanding tourism; In order to obtain loans, for financial assistance and technical assistance, insisted on trying to bring British Guiana and British Honduras into the Union
 in samaantaaon ke baavjood, vahaan kaaphi matbhed the
 The WIFLP advocated the promotion of agriculture, while the DLP promised a favorable climate for both private industry and the development of labor, human and economic resources
 dabluelpi ne bahama ko sangh main shaamil hone ke liye protsaahit karne kaa vaada kiya, jabaki dlapi ne nahin kiya
 The WIFLP also campaigned for the establishment of a central bank to expand credit resources and advocated complete internal self-government for a democratic socialist society and all unit territories, while avoiding issues of the independence movement and a custom union
 dlapi ne purna aantarik swashaasan ke bare main kuch nahin kaha, par samaajwaad par hamalaa kiya, ucch karadhaan se bachane kii koshish kii or west indies kii ekta kii kaamana kii, puja kii swatantraaa or abhivyakti or trade unionon ke protsaahan par bal diya
 a federal election was held on March 25, 1958
 dabluelpi ne 26 siton ke saath chunaav main jeet hasil kii jabaki dlapi 19 siton ko hi hasil kar paaya
 The WIFLP received the bulk of the seats from the smaller islands, while the DLP received a majority in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago
 dlapi ne jamaica main 11 siton or trinidad main 6 siton main jeet hasil kii
 While appointing the Senate, the Governor General Lord Hales realized that only the St
 Vincent Island government was controlled by the DLP, with the result that the Senate was going to the WIFLP in a disproportionate manner
 ek vivaadaaspad faisle main unhone jamaica or trinidad main vipaksh dlapi samoohon se sampark kiya or un dwipon main se prayek se ek dlapi seenetter niyukt kiya he
 Thus the Senate consisted of 15 WIFLP members and 4 DLP members

 But both did not contest the federal election and preferred to retain control of their respective island
 iskaa arth yah tha ki do sabase mahatvapurn praanton ke netaaon ne sangh ko vyavhaarya ke rup main nahin dekha
 Similarly, Jamaican founder Alexander Bustamante of DLP also declined to contest the union and left the party leadership for Trinidadian Ashford Sinanan

 The federal structure of the West Indies Union was unusually weak
 udhaaharan ke liye, iske praant ek ekal custom union main shaamil nahin the
 Thus, each province was acting as a separate economy with tariffs, mainly because smaller provinces were afraid of being overwhelmed by the economies of the larger island
 iske alaava, sangh ke bheetar andolan kii puri swatantraaa ko lagu nahin kiya gaya, kyonki bade praant chote dwipon se bade paimaane par palaayan ke bare main chintit the
 In this sense, it can be said that the current European Union has implemented a more integrated economic environment than the West Indian effort
 or na hi sangheey sarkaar kaary karne ke liye apane ghatak rajyon ko laa pai
 The initial federal budget was quite small, which restricted the federal government from using its financial generosity as a carrot
 vah united kingdom or apane sadsy deshon ke anudaan par nirbhar tha
 The provincial budgets of Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago were both larger than the federal budget
 iske chalate un rajyon se sangheey sarkaar ke liye adhik se adhik vitt poshan pradaan ke anurodhon ko doharaaya gaya
 These requests were ignored because both Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago had already contributed about 85 percent of federal revenue, roughly in equal parts
 iske alaava, pradhanmantri kaa pad kaaphi kamjor tha
 Unlike other Westminster systems with the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of the West Indian Union could not dissolve Parliament
 vishesh rup se sangh ne canada ke saath kareebi sambandhon ko banaae rakhaa tha, jiskaa ateet bhi is rup main samaan tha ki vah kai purv british upniveshon kaa ek mahasang tha
 In the early years, many Caribbean leaders suggested that the West Indies Union should investigate the possibility of becoming a Canadian province, though it was never more than a fleeting one
 vaarta ke khandit hone ke baavjood, may 1961 main canada ne kshetra ke do sabase mahatvapurn uphaar ko westeindies sangh ko prastut kiya: do vyapaaree jahaaj, jiskaa naam da fedral palm or ga fedral mapel tha
 These two ships visited each island twice a month in the federation and provided an important maritime contact between the islands
 sangh ke samaapt hone ke liye kai kaarnon ko ginaya gaya he, unamem se kuch ko upar "samasya" anubhag main vistaar se bataaya gaya he
 This included lack of local public support, competitive insular nationalism, weakness of federal government, curb on federal taxation and freedom of movement, lack of federal constitution, fundamental changes to constitution at the beginning of its existence, political quarrels among influential leaders
 , The three most influential leaders decide not to participate in the federal election, the two largest units are Population and Resources The impact of heavy concentration, geographic and cultural distance between the units, lack of history of public administration and self-state period s who was standing by the Crown Colony system
 haalaanki, sangh ke vighatan ke liye tatkaal utprerak jamcon asantosh tha
 By 1961, Jamaica had a number of reasons for dissatisfaction with the state of affairs: jamaica ke asantusht hone kaa sabase mahatvapurn kaaran sangh kii aupniveshik sthiti kaa jari rahanaa tha
 Jamaica joined the Union because its leaders believed that the West Indies would soon be given independence
 sangh ke gathan ke lagbhag teen saal baad bhi aisa nahin hua tha, isi bich, chote british upnivesh jaise cyprus or siyara leone ne swatantraaa praapt kar lee thi
 Thus, many Jamaicans believed that the island should seek independence from its authority and this could happen
 saath hi sangh dwaara prastaavit rajdhani chaugaaramasa ke saath bhi samasyaayein thi, us samay vah sanyukt rajya ke haathon main tha 
 Many leaders of the Caribbean province wanted Chaguramas as the capital of the Confederacy
 kshetreey netaa jaise, jamaica ke norman manale or dow erik williams ne chaugaaramas ko sanyukt rajya se chhudaa kar sangh ko saunpe jane kii vakaalat kii
 However, the United States and Britain disagreed, and the Prime Minister of the Federation, Grantley Adams, refused provincial leaders to obtain Chaugaramas
 kai jamikans ko tab laga ki sangh unki vikaas prakriya or swatantraaa andolan ko baadhit kar rahaa he
 As a result, the Jamaican Labor Party, led by Bustamante, successfully forced Manley to hold a referendum in September 1961 over political isolation from the Union
 us samay ke prantiy pradhanmantri manale ke virodh ke baavjood, 54 pratishat vot ke saath ise paarit kar diya gaya
 Manley himself was defeated in the island elections of April 1962 and Bustamante became the first Prime Minister of independent Jamaica on 6 August 1962
 jamaica ke jane ke baad, puraane malbe se ek nayaa mahasang khadaa karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 For this, there was considerable reliance on Williams, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, who said in the past that he wanted a "strong union"
 antigua ke pradhanmantri ware bird ne jawaab diya ki sangh main unka praant trinidad ke baraabar kaa hissedaar he, "ek chote se tobago" kii tarah nahi he
 He indicated that a strong federation was acceptable provided no attempt was made to create a unitary state
 is nae sangh par vaarta sitambar 1961 main shuru hui; haalaanki, unhone sanket diya ki trinidad ko 75 se 80 pratishat tak nae mahasang kaa rajasav pradaan karnaa hoga
 Furthermore, even though Trinidad now represents 60 percent of the new union's population, the resolution under consideration had to be given less than half the seats in Parliament
 november tak, williams ne sanket diya ki ab vah ek ekaatmak rajya banane ke vichaar ke paksh main he
 Failing that, he resolved to take independence to Trinidad and Tobago
 jiske tahat 4 disambar 1961 ko unhen ek trinidadian netaa ke rup punarnirvachan dwaara simit kiya gaya
 Later in December, Barbados Prime Minister Errol Barrow met with Williams, but failed to persuade him to keep Trinidad in the Union
 14 janvari,1962 ko naishanal pipuls movement ne sangh ke saath kisi bhi aage kii bhagidaari ko khaarij karne ke prastaav ko paarit kiya
 Williams himself stated that "if we remove one out of ten, only zero remains" In other words, without Jamaica, union was not possible
 trinidad or tobago ko 31 agast 1962 ko swatantraaa mili
 Without Trinidad and Jamaica, the remaining "little Eight" attempted to retain some form of West Indies union, this time focused on Barbados
 haalaanki, ye vaartaayen antat nirarthak sabit hui
 Without its two largest states, the Union was ruined by financial bankruptcy
 barbados is samay vittiya boj ko apane kandhe par uthaane se inkaar kar diya or antigua or grenada kramshah jamaica or trinidad ke saath vilay karne ke vichaar ke saath dilchaspee lenaa shuru kiya
 The West Indies Union was legally dissolved with the West Indies Act 1962 of the Parliament of the United Kingdom

 caman dweep or turk and koicos dweep ko jamaica ke 1962 main swatantraaa ke baad isse alag kar diya gaya tha; 1980 main saint kits or nevis se anguila ko alag kiya gaya
 All three also remain British territories

 All of these stamps had a common design with a map of the Caribbean and a depiction of Queen Elizabeth with "the West Indies / Federation 1958" written on top and the member's name at the bottom

 yah puraa nirmaan ek kuch sidhiyon oonche chabutare par khadaa he
 Influenced by Persian architecture, this tomb is 47 m
 High and 300 feet wide

 This dome is built on a 42
5 meter high necked cylinder
 gumbad ke upar 6 meter ooncha pital kaa kirit kalash sthapit he or uske upar chandramaa laga hua he, jo taimur vansh ke makbaron main miltaa he
 The dome is made in double layer, the outer layer is covered with white marble and the inner layer is made of cave form
 gumbad ke shuddh or nirmal shwet rup se alag shesh imaarat laal balua pathar kii bani he, jisapar shwet or kaale sangmarmar tathaa pile balua pathar se pachchikari kaa kaam kiya gaya he
 These combination of colors gives the building a distinct aura
 baahar se saral dikhne vaali imaarat kii aantarik yojana kuch jatil he
 It has nine square rooms including the main central chamber
 inamen bich main bane mukhya kaksh ko ghere hue shesh aath dumanjile kaksh bich main khulte hai
 The main chamber is domed and double-storey in height and consists of a tomb of the second Mughal emperor Humayun in a lattice enclosure with eight ridges in the very middle below the dome
 ye imaarat kii mukhya kabr he
 Its entrance is on the southern side with a single EVAN, and the evans of other directions have a network of white confluence
 samraat kii asli samadhi thik neeche aantarik kaksh main bani he, jiskaa rasta baahar se jaataa he
 Just above it is a showy but beautiful replica
 neeche tak aam paryatakon ko pahunch nahin di gai he
 The entire building uses a marble mosaic called the Petra Dura and this type of tomb placement is an important part of indo-islamic architecture, which has been used extensively in the later tombs of the Mughal Empire, such as the Taj Mahal
 mukhya kaksh main sangmarmar kii jalidaar ghere ke thik upar mehrab bhi bana he, jo pashchim main makka kii ore bana he
 There is a line of sura-un-noor, usually at the entrance, instead of Sura 24 of the Quran, through which light enters the Qibla
 is prakaar samraat kaa str unke virodhiyon or pratidwandiyon se ooncha devatv ke nikat ho jaataa he
 The principal room has four octagonal rooms at four angles, connected by an arched gallery
 pradhan kaksh kii bhujaaon ke bich bich main chaar anya kaksh bhi bane hai
 These eight rooms make a circumambulation of the main tomb, as seen in Sufism and many other Mughal tombs; At the same time, they also indicate Paradise in the religion of Islam
 in prayek kamaron ke saath 8-8 kamare or bane hai, jo kul milakar 124 kakshiya yojana kaa ang hai
 In these small rooms, the tombs of many Mughal Nawabs and courtiers are built from time to time
 inamen se pramukh hai hamida bano begum or daara shikoh kii kabren
 Including the first floor, this main building has more than 100 tombs, most of which do not have the identity of the person buried due to the inscription, but it is certain that they are from the royal family or courtiers of the Mughal Empire
 Were, so the building is labeled as the cemetery of the Mughals
 is imaarat main laal baluapathar par shwet sangmarmar ke sangyojan kaa sarvapratham prayog kiya gaya tha
 Along with this, there are many components of Indian architecture, such as small canopies of Rajasthani architecture enclosing the main dome, which were originally covered with blue tiles
 humayu ke makbare kaa bahari mehrab, jisamen do staron par do dhaaren dikhaai detii hai
 Humayun's Tomb Interior pashchim kii ore makka ko mukh kiye hue jharokhe main baarik kati sangmarmar kii jaali Humayun's tomb, in the main chamber; The original grave is built in the lower chamber
 chote kaksh mehrabadar jaali se dhanke hue hai
 The construction of the main building took eight years, but its full beauty is enhanced by the Charbagh-style Mughal gardens spread over 30 acres surrounding it
 ye udyaan bharat hi nahin varan dakshin asia main apni prakaar ke pehle udhaaharan the
 These are examples of high-grade geometry
 jananath rupi udyaan chaharadivari ke bheetar bana he
 The park is divided into four sections by walking paths and two dividing central waterways
 ye islam ke jananath ke baag main bahane vaali chaar nadiyon ke parichaayak hai
 The four gardens thus constructed are again divided into four smaller parts by stone paths
 is prakaar kul milakar 36 bhaag banate hai
 The central water pipe from the main gate to the mausoleum seems to go under it and reappear from the other side, just as the 'garden of paradise' is described in the verses of the Quran
 makbare ko ghere hue charbagh hai, va unhen ghere hue teen ore oonchi pathar kii chaharadivari he va teesri ore kabhi nikat hi yamuna nadi baha karti thi, jo samay ke saath parisar se dur chali gai he
 Central walkways lead to two gates: one main gate in the southern wall and the other small gate in the western wall
 ye donon dwaar dumanjila hai
 Of these, the western gate is now used, and the southern gate used to be in the Mughal period and is now closed
 purvi diwaar se judi hui ek baradari he
 It has twelve gates according to the name and used to enjoy the cool flowing open air
 uttari diwaar se laga hua ek hammam he jo snaan ke kaam aata tha
 The tomb complex has a barber dome built in 1590 in the south-eastern direction inside Charbagh
 isaki mukhya parisar main upasthiti dafanaaye gayi vyakti kii mahatta darshaati he
 He used to be a royal hairdresser
 yah makbara ek oonche chabutare par bana he jis pahunchane ke liye dakshini ore se saat seedhiyaan bani hai
 It is square and has a double dome over its solitary chamber
 andar do kabron par kuran kii aayatein khudi hui hai
 One of these graves has 999 figures inscribed on it, meaning the year 999 of Hijri, which states 1590-91 AD
 humayun ke makbare ke mukhya pashchimi praveshdwar ke raste main anek anya smarak bane hai
 The chief monument of these is the tomb of Isa Khan Niazi, which was built in 1547, 20 years before the main tomb
 isa khan niyazi mughalon ke viruddh ladane vaala sur vansh ke shaasha shershah suri ke darbar kaa ek afgaan nawab tha
 This tomb was built during the life of Isa Khan and after that it worked for his whole family only
 makbare ke pashchim main ek teen angan chaudee laal balua pathar kii masjid he
 This Athmukha tomb is very similar to the other mausoleums located in the Lodhi mausoleum complex of the Sur dynasty
 is parisar main mukhya chaharadivari ke baahar sthit anya smarakon main pramukh he: bu haleema kaa makbara or uske baag
 This mausoleum is now destroyed and from the remains it is known that it was not located in the center
 isse abhas hota he ki sambhawatah ye baad main joda gaya hoga
 Then comes the Arabian inn which was built by Hamida Begum for the artisans engaged in the construction of the main mausoleum
 is parisar main hi afasarvaala makbara bhi bana he, jo akbar ke ek nawab ke liye bana tha
 Along with this, its mosque is also built
 puure parisar ke baahar bana he nila burj naamak makbara
 It derives its name from the blue glazed tiles above its dome
 ye makbara akbar ke darbari bairam khan ke putr abdul rahim khanekhana dwaara apane sevak miyaan fahim ke liye banwaaya gaya tha
 Fahim Mian grew up with his son Firoz Khan and along with him, he fought in the rebellion of Mahabat Khan, a Mughal commander during Jahangir's time in 1625 / 26
 ye makbara apane sthapaty main anoothaa he
 It is octagonal from outside while square from inside
 isaki chat apane samay ke prachlit dohare gumbad se alag gardandaar gumbad or andar hue plaster par bahut hi sundar chitrakaari va pachchikari ke kaaran vishesh ullekhneey he
 Some other monuments of the Mughal period, a little further away from this complex, are the Bada Batashewala Mahal, the small Batashewala Mahal and a bridge called Barapula with 12 pillars with 11 arches between them
 iskaa nirmaan jahangir ke darbar ke ek hinjade mihr banu aagaa ne 1621 main karavaaya tha
 Tomb of Isa Khan Niazi, 1547 afasarvaala makbara or masjid, nikat humayu makbara; 1803 Barber's Tomb with main building
 chayachitr: 1858, jon mare William Finch, an English merchant, visited the mausoleum in 1611
 usne likhaa he ki kendriya kaksh kii aantarik sajja, aaj ke khalipan se alag badhiya kalinon va galichon se paripurna thi
 There was a pure white awning above the tombs and holy texts were kept in front of them

 The charbagh spread here is spread over an area of 13 hectares
 aane vaale varshon main ye sab teji se badalata gaya
 The main reason for this was the Agra transfer of the capital
 baad ke mughal shaskaon ke paas itnaa dhan nahin rahaa ki ve in baagon aadi kaa manhagaa rakrakhaav kar saken
 By the 18th century, the local people started growing vegetables in Charbagas here
 1860 main mughal style ke charbagh angrezi style main badalte gayi
 In these, four central ponds turned into circles and trees started growing in the beds
 baad main 20veen shatabdi main lord karzan jab bharat ke viceroy bane, tab unhone ise waapas sudhara
 Between 1903-1909, a large garden restoration project started, under which sandstone was also placed in the drains

 Later they were taken under his control by the Government of India
 ye camp lagbhag paanch varshon tak rahe or inase smarakon ko atyadhik kshati pahunchi, khaskar inke bagichon, pani kii sundar naaliyon aadi ko
 Subsequently, the site inside the mausoleum was covered with bricks to prevent the demolition, which the Archaeological Survey of India established back in its old form in the coming years

 gharshan : If another solid object is placed on a stationary solid object in such a way that both flat surfaces spur each other, in this case, the second object has to exert force to move the first object
 When the lower object is less than a limit, the second object cannot move on the first object
 It is clear from this statement that the contact rhythm of both the objects is produced in the opposite direction of a force speed which is the speed of the second object
 This opposing force is called 'friction'
 gharshan ek bal he jo do talon ke bich saapekshik sparshi gati kaa virodh karata he
 The value of the force of friction depends on the force of force between the two planes
 gharshan ke do prakaar hai: sthitik or gatij
 Static friction occurs in the parallel direction of the contact surface of two bodies, but kinetic friction does not depend on the direction of motion
 saamanyat: koi sataha purnataya chikani nahin hoti, apitu usamen atyalp pariman ke uthaav or gadde hote hai
 These can only be seen with good microscopes
 at: jab aisi do satahen ek duusare ko sparsh karti hai, to ek sataha ke uthaav duusari sataha ke gaddhon main fas jate hai
 In this state, applying force to move one surface to another creates distortions in the surface texture
 isi ke anuroop padaartho kii pratyasthata ke kaaran prayukt bal kii viruddh disha main pratibal kaary karata he, jise gharshanbal kehete hai
 Friction has a very important place in our daily lives
 prithvi kii sataha par chalanevaale prayek vaahan kii gati sataha tathaa vaahan ke aadhaar ke bich gharshanbal dwaara hi sambhav he
 Therefore, friction is both a speed barrier and a seeker
 dharuk or snehakon ke vyavhaar main bhi gharshan kaa pramukh sthaan he
 The sand adopts a cone shape with the inclination angle of the internal friction
 In order to displace a solid substance on a solid surface, a force parallel to the tactile surface has to be applied
 yadi prayukt bal ek nishchit pariman se kam hua, to padarthpind visthapit nahin hota or yadi adhik hua to nishchit veg se visthapit hota he
 This is due to friction between the tangent surfaces, which implies that a force acts on the solid body against the force applied parallel to the tactile surface, called the force of friction
 gharshan bal kaa kaaran satahon kaa khurdurapan hota he
 The force of friction before displacement is equal to the force used, which is called static friction
 visthaapan ke liye prayukt bal kam se kam itane pariman kaa hona chahie ki vikruti charam pratyasthata se adhik ho
 The magnitude of this minimum force required for displacement is called extreme friction
 charam gharshanbal tathaa dono satahon ke bich abhilambi daab main nimnlikhi sambandh hota he : Whereas static dithering is called constant
 iskaa maan padarthpind ko sataha par rakhkar sataha par rakhkar sataha kaa nunatam jhukaav kone, jisapar padarthpind phislan prarambh kare, gyaat karke maaloom kar sakate hai
 This angle is called the friction angle

 iskaa pariman mukhyatya visthaapan ke prakaar par nirbhar karata he
 a solid substance can be displaced only by sliding or rolling it on the solid surface; Therefore, according to these two displacement types, there are two types of dynamic friction

 The value of the cog does not depend on the magnitude of the motion for the small relative motion of the surfaces
 parantu jab gati kaa pariman kranthik veg se adhik ho jaataa he, to veg kii vruddhi ke saath saath cag kaa maan hota jaataa he
 The value of the cag is different for spoilage and feeding speeds

 Kammo escapes Raka to Bhauji, the wife of a robber robber who helps him and Raju escape
 donon bhagkar police suparintendent ke paas jate hai or police suparintendent kammo ko qaid kar daakuon kaa safaaya karne kaa huqm de detaa he
 Raju comes back to the bandits 'base and urges the bandits' wives to insist on robbing the bandits

 Raka falls alone to go to the police with him
 daaku apana adda chhodkar police kii ore ravaanaa hote hai or udhar kammo police ke dabaav main aakar police ko daakuon ke thikaane kii taraf le chalati he
 At one place, the two parties clash and on the instigation of Raka, the bandits again take up arms and make up their mind to take on the police
 tabhi raju daakuon ke bivi bacchon ko lekar donon dalon ke bich main aakar khadaa ho jaataa he or phir se daakuon se hathiyaar daal dene kaa aagrah karata he
 This time, all the bandits, including Raka, put their weapons and surrender themselves and their family to the police

 The police superintendent assures everyone that the robbers will surely get the punishment for their actions but not the death penalty
