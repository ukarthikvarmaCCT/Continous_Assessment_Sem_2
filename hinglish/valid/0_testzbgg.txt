 In protest against this, Gandhiji took a six-day hunger strike in September 1932, which forced the government to successfully adopt a similar system of mediation by Palvankar Balu, a Dalit-turned-political leader
 achhuton ke jivan ko sudhaarney ke liye gandhi ji dwaara chalaae gaye is abhiyaan kii shuruuaat thi

 However, Gandhi wished to focus his full attention on achieving independence and not on speculation about India's future

 Gandhi had differences with Subhash Bose, who was elected to the presidency in 1938
 bose ke saath matbhedon main gandhi ke mukhya bindu bose kii loktantr main patibaddhta kii kami tathaa ahimsa main vishwaas kii kami thi
 Bose won for the second time in spite of Gandhi's criticism, but left the Congress when all Indian leaders abandoned all the principles implemented by Gandhiji

 As the war progressed Gandhiji intensified his demand for independence by giving the British the Quit India Movement
 yah gandhi tathaa congress party kaa sarvaadhik spasht vidroh tha jo bhartiya seemaa se angrejon ko khadedane par lakshith tha
 Jawaharlal Nehru's party, sitting second to Gandhiji, was criticized by some members of the party and by some other political Indian parties who believed in both the British and the opposition
 kuch kaa maananaa tha ki apane jivan kaal main athwa maut ke sangharsh main angrejon kaa virodh karnaa ek nashwar kaary he jabaki kuch maanate the ki gandhi ji paryaapt koshish nahin kar rahe hai
 Quit India became the most powerful movement of this struggle which led to widespread violence and arrest
 police kii goliyon se hajaaron kii sankhya main swatantraaa senaanee yaa to maare gaye yaa ghayal ho gaye or hajaaron giraftaar kar liye gaye

 He said that the order of chaos around him is worse than real anarchy

 At the end of the war, the British gave a clear indication that the Santha would be transferred and handed over to the Indians
 is samay gandhi ji ne andolan ko band kar diya jisase congressi netaaon sahit lagbhag 100,000 rajnatik bandiyon ko reeha kar diya gaya
 In 1946, Gandhiji advised the Congress to reject the proposal of the British kbnet Mission as he was deeply skeptical of the proposed grouping for Muslim dominated provinces, hence Gandhi viewed the episode as a rehearsal of a partition
 haalanki kuch samay se gandhi ji ke saath congress dwaara matbhedon vaali ghatana main se yah bhi ek ghatana bani chunki nehru or patel jaanate the ki yadi congress is yojana kaa anumodan nahin karti he tab sarkaar kaa niyantran muslim lig ke paas chalaa jayega

 gandhi ji kisi bhi aisi yojana ke khilaaf the jo bharat ko do alag alag deshon main vibhajit kar de
 The overwhelming majority of many Hindus and Sikhs and Muslims living in India were in favor of the partition of the country
 iske atirikt mohammad ali jinna, muslim lig ke netaa ne, pashchim punjab, sindh, uttar pashchim seemaant praant or purvi bengal main vyapak sahyog kaa parichay diya

 Close associates of Gandhiji accepted Partition as the best solution and Sardar Patel tried to convince Gandhiji that this was the only way to prevent a war with civil unrest

 He started his first fast-unto-death in Delhi asking for immediate end to communal violence for all and to pay Rs 55 crore to Pakistan
 gandhi ji ko dar tha ki pakistan main asthirataa or asuraksha se bharat ke prati unka gussa or bad jayega tathaa seemaa par hinsa fail jaaegi
 He further feared that Hindus and Muslims would renew their enmity again and that there could be a possibility of a civil war

 In the times of peace and disorder, an army like armed soldiers ahimsaatmak kaary unka yah kartavya hoga ki ve vijay dilaane vaale samudaayon ko ekajute karen jisamen shanti kaa prasar, tathaa aisi gatividhiyon kaa samavesh ho jo kisi bhi vyakti ko uske carch athwa khand main sampark banaae rakhte hue apane saath mila len
 This type of Saina should be prepared to fight any emergency and should also have sufficient strength of soldiers to die to calm the anger of the mob; xxrep 4 ; Up to the city can be organized in each block of buildings
 If non-violent society is attacked, then two paths of non-violence open
 adhikaar paane ke liye hamalavar se sahyog na karen balki samarpan karne kii apeksha mrityu ko gale lagaana pasand karen
 The other way would be to have non-violent resistance by people who have been trained in a non-violent way 


 Men and women love to die easily instead of surrendering to the will of the attacker on the endless paths of this unexpected performance and finally : He and his military bravery must melt before the xxrep 4 ; aise kisi desh athwa samooh jisane anhinsa ko apni antim niti bana liya he use parmaanu bam bhi apana das nahin bana saktaa he
 In that country, the level of non-violence passes happily, then it naturally increases so much that it has universal respect milane lagata he
 In line with these ideas, in 1940, when the invasions by Nazi Germany on the British islands appeared imminent, Gandhiji asked the British to follow the following policy of non-violence in peace and war
 main aapse hathiyaar rakhane ke liye kahana pasand karuunga kyonki ye aapako athwa maanavtaa ko bachaane main bekaar hai
 You have to invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini that whatever they want from countries you call them your right
 yadi in sajjanon ko apane ghar par rahane kaa chayan karnaa he tab aapako unhen khaali karnaa hoga
 If they do not give you the easy way, then you will allow yourself, men to sacrifice women and children, but will refuse to bow down to your loyalty
 1946 main yuddh ke baad die gaye ek saakshaatkaar main unhone isse bhi aage ek vichaar kaa prastutikaran kiya
 The Jews should have given themselves to the butcher's knife
 unhen apane aap ko samudri chattaanon se samudr ke andar phank dena chahie tha
 Yet Gandhiji knew that such a level of non-violence would require unwavering faith and courage and for this he realized that it is not held by everyone
 isliye unhone prayek vyakti ko paraamarsh diya ki unhen ahimsa ko apane paas rakhane kii jarurat nahin he khaas taur par us samay jab ise kaayarta ke sangrakshan ke liye upyog main kiya gaya ho
 In his Satyagraha movement Gandhiji kept away people who were afraid to take up arms or felt their own inability to resist
 unhone likhaa ki main maanata hum ki jahaan darpok or hinsa main se kisi ek ko chunanaa ho to main hinsa ke paksh main apni raay duungaa
 i kept repeating the warning on every assembly till they realized that they had come under the authority of a non-destructive force which they had been in possession of before and they had been used to that experiment and believed He had nothing to do with non-violence and took up arms again

 In his childhood, Gandhi had the experience of eating meat
 aisa unki uttaradhikari jigyaasa ke kaaran hi tha jisamen uske utsahvardhak mitra shaikh mehtab kaa bhi yogadan tha
 The idea of vegetarianism was deeply ingrained in Hindu and Jain practices of India and most Hindus in their homeland Gujarat were vegetarian
 isi tarah jain bhi the
 Gandhi's family was also not untouched by this
 padhai ke liye landan aane se purv gandhi ji ne apni mata putalibai or apane chachaa becharji swami se ek vaayada kiya tha ki ve maance khaane, sharaab pine se tathaa sankinta se dur rahenge
 He fasted to keep his promises and by doing so, the evidence was found which could not be found by having food, he had gained the basis for his lifetime philosophy
 jaise jaise gandhi ji vyask hote gaye ve purnataya shaakaahaari ban gaye
 He has also written The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism and many articles on the subject, some of which have also been published in The Vegetarian, a publication of the London Vegetarian Society
 gandhi ji swayan is avadhi main bahut si mahaan vibhootiyon se prerit hue or landan vegeterian sosayadi ke chayarmen dow0 josia oldfield ke mitra ban gaye
 Henry Stephen Salt | After reading and praising the works of Henry Stephen Salt, young Mohandas Gandhi met and corresponded with the vegetarian preacher
 gandhi ji ne landan main rahete samay or uske baad shaakaahaari bhojan kii vakaalat karne main kaaphi samay bitaayaa
 Gandhiji said that vegetarian food not only fulfills the needs of the body but it also serves the economic purpose which is made of meat and yet meat is more expensive than grains, vegetables and fruits
 iske alaava kai bhartiya jo aay kam hone kii vajah se sangharsh kar rahe the, us samay jo shaakaahaari ke rup main dikhaai de rahe the vah aadhyatmik parampara hi nahin vyaavhaarikta ke kaaran bhi tha

 Gandhiji used to make fruit from the beginning, but started drinking goat's milk on the advice of his doctor
 He never used to consume milk-products because earlier he believed that milk is not a natural diet of man and he was fed with cow's milk
 Chitkaar Seghrina was, and the most important reason was the oath which he made to his late mother
 jab gandhi ji solah saal ke hue tab unke pitashri kii tabiyat bahut karaab thi unke pita kii beemaari ke dauraan ve hameshaa upasthit rahete the kyonki ve apane mata-pita ke prati atyant samarpit the

 This decision was completely influenced by the philosophy of Brahmacharya
 Spiritual and practical purity is largely associated with celibacy and disinterestedness
 Gandhi saw celibacy as the primary basis for getting closer to God and identifying himself in his autobiography
 The childhood bride tells her libido and Ishrya's struggles with Kasturba
 She realized that this person They have a duty to remain celibate so that they can learn the love of lust instead
 For Gandhi, celibacy meant "control of thoughts, words and actions within the senses"
 gandhi ji kaa maananaa tha ki agar ek vyakti samaaj seva main karyrat he to use saadhaaran jivan kii or hi badhanaa chahie jise ve brahmacharya ke liye aavashyak maanate the
 unki saadagi ne pashchami jivan style ko tyaagane par majaboor karne laga or ve dakshin africa main failane lage the ise ve "khud ko shunaya ke sthiti main laana" kehete hai jisame anaavashyak kharch, saadhaaran jivan style ko apnaanaa or apane vastra swayan dhonaa aavashyak he

 Gandhi used to wear silence one day a week
 He believed that by refraining from speaking, he gets inner peace
 This influence of Hindu silence theory on him, and he used to contact others by writing on paper on those days, for three and a half years from the age of 37, Gandhiji refused to read newspapers, in response to which he said The steady state of the world today has confused him more than his own inner turmoil
 jon ruskin kii antu dis last, padhne ke baad unhone apane jivan style main parivartan karne kaa faisla kiya tathaa ek samudaay banaaya jise amarpakshi avasthaapan kaha jaataa tha
 After returning from South Africa, where he had completed advocacy and was associated with wealth and success, he renounced western-style clothes
 He accepted the clothes worn by India's poorest man, and Gandhi also advocated wearing home-made clothes
 Gandhi and his followers adopted the practice of weaving their own clothes through cotton and others like it
 Encouraged to work
 Although Indian workers were often lazy due to unemployment, they often bought their clothes from industrial manufacturers intended to serve British interests
 Gandhi's opinion was that if Indians started making their own clothes, it would be an economic shock to the British settled in India
 Consequently, the charkha was later included in the Indian national flag
 To reflect their ordinary life he later wore a dhoti for the rest of his life gandhi kaa janm hindu dharm main hua, unke puure jivan main adhiktar siddhanton kii utpati hindutv se hua
 Like ordinary Hindus, they believed in all religions equally, and so they rejected all arguments and efforts for conversion

 Gandhi believed that truth and love are at the core of every religion
 unka kahana he ki 'quran', 'bible', 'jend-avesta', 'talmud', athwa 'gita' kisi bhi madhyam se dekhie, ham sabakaa ishwar ek hi he, or vah satya tathaa prem swaroop he
 He also questioned questions about hypocrisy, hypocrisy etc
 on the principles of all religions
 ve ek athak samaaj sudhaarak the
 Some of his comments with reference to various religions are as follows: baad main unase jab poocha gaya ki kya tum hindu ho, unhone kaha: Despite having deep respect for each other, Gandhi and Rabindranath Thakur engaged in a long debate more than once
 ye vaad-vivaad donon ke darshanik matbhed ko darshaate hai
 Both of them were famous Indian thinkers of that time
 15 janvari 1934 ko bihar main aaye bheeshan bukamp ke sandarbh main gandhi ji ne sarvapratham 24 janvari 1934 ko tinnavalli kii saarvajanik sabha main kaha tha ki bhale hi aap mujhe andhvishwasi hi kahen, magar mujh jaisaa aadmi yahi maanegaa ki bhagwaan ne hamen hamaare paapon kaa dand dene ke liye is bhayankar bukamp ko bheja he

 On January 25 too, he inspired people to abandon untouchability as a great sin in the context of this incident, and on January 26, at a reception organized by traders in Madura, he said that i am believing that this misfortune on us is due to untouchability
 Has come as a result of this enormity
 main aapse vinati karata hoon ki aap meri baat par man hi man hans kar aisa na sochen ki main to aapke andhvishwaas kii vritti ko jagaa rahaa hoon
 i am not doing anything like this
 


 main bhale hi andhvishwasi kaha jaaon, lekin jis baat ko main apane hriday kii gaharaai main mahasoos kar rahaa hoon, use aapse kahe bina rah nahin saktaa
 


 If you believe in this thing like me, then you will be quick to take decisions and believe that the practice of untouchability like we practice today is not in the Hindu scriptures
 aap mere is vichaar se sahamat honge ki kisi bhi manushya ko asprishy maananaa ek bhayankar paap he
 Man's ego tells him that he is superior to other people
 gandhi ji ke is vichaar ko andhvishwaas ko badhaava dene main sakasham hone ke kaaran avivekpurna maanate hue rabindranath tagore ne likhaa ki bhautik aapadaaon kaa nishchit or ekmaatr mul kaaran kuch khaas bhautik tathyon ke yoga se hota he

 If i use that faith to condemn my opponents because of my gross ignorance, then surely such belief will become a degenerate superstition

 Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and his associates condemned Gandhi and alleged that he is politically engaged in persuading Muslims and that he is negligent about the atrocities on Hindus and has approved the creation of Pakistan
 It is still politically controversial today, as pakistani-american historian Ayesha Jalal argues that Gandhi and the Congress were not willing to share power with the Muslim League because of the partition, for example Hindu nationalist politician Pravin Togadia also Criticizing the leadership about the subject, it also indicates that the extreme weakness of their part led to the partition of India
 gandhi ne 1930 ke ant-ant main vibhaajan ko lekar israel ke nirmaan ke liye philistin ke vibhaajan ke prati bhi apni aruchi jaahir kii thi
 On 26 October 1938, he said in Harijan: mujhe kai patr praapt hue jiname mujhase poocha gaya ki main ghoshit karun ki germany main yahudiyon ke utpedan or arab-yahudiyon ke bare main kya vichaar rakhata hoon 
 aisa nahi ki is kathin prashn par apane vichaar main bina jhijak ke de paaungaa
 meri sahanubhuti yahudion ke saath he
 i am closely acquainted with them from South Africa, some have become my companions for life
 in mitron ke dwaara hi mujhe lambey samay se ho rahe utpedan ke bare main jaankaree mili
 ve isai dharm ke achhut rahe hai par meri sahanubhuti mujhe nyaay kii aavashyaktaa se vivekshunya nahi karti yahudiyon ke liye ek raashtra kii duhai mujhe zyada aakarshith nahi karti
 jisaki manjuuri bibal main di gayi or jis jid se ve apni vaapasi main philistin ko chaahane lage hai
 Why don't they love the other people of the earth, make the country their home where they were born and where they live
 philistin arabon kaa hai, thik usee tarah jis tarah inland angrejon kaa or france francision kaa
 yahudiyon ko arabon par adhiropit karnaa anuchit or amanviya he jo kuch bhi aaj philistin main ho rahaa hai use kisi bhi aachaar samhita se sahi sabit nahi kiya ja saktaa
 Those who wanted to gain independence through violence also came under the grip of a little political fire because of their criticism of Gandhi, his refusal against the hanging of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Udam Singh, Rajguru caused his condemnation in some parties
 is aalochana ke liye gandhi ne kaha,"ek aisa samay tha jab log mujhe suna karte the kii kis tarah angrejo se bina hathiyaar ladaa ja saktaa he kyonki tab hathyaar nahi the
 

 But today i am told that my non-violence is of no use because it cannot stop the riots of hindu-muslims, so one should be armed for self-defense
 " unhone apni bahes kai lekho main kii, jo kii homer jacks ke da gandhi reader: ek strot unke lekhnee or jivan kaa 
 1938 main jab pehali baar "yahudeevaad or semetisam virdohi" likhi gai, gandhi ne 1930 main hue germany main yahudiyon par hue utpedan ko satyagrah ke antargat bataaya unhone germany main yahudiyon dwaara sahe gaye kathinaaiyon ke liye ahimsa ke tareeke ko istemaal karne kii peshkash yah kehete hue kii If i had been a Jew and had been born in Germany and had been earning my living from there, considering that Germany would be my home, that a decent German would threaten me to shoot me or throw me into a dark chamber, i would tread and disparate i will refuse to be subjected to
 And for this, i will wait for the Jewish brothers to come and join me in my legal impunity, rather i am confident that in the end all will be compelled to accept my example
 If the recipe given here is accepted by a single Jew or all Jews, then their situation will not be worse than what it is today
 And if they willingly bear the given pain, it will give them inner strength and pleasure and Hitler's deliberate violence is also extracted as a simple genocide of the Jews and this will be the first answer against the declaration of his atrocities
 ishvar kaa bhay rakhane vaale, mrityu ke aatank se nahi darate
 Gandhi's statements received a lot of criticism for which he answered in the "question on Jews" article, along with his friends criticizing my appeal to the Jews
 Told the remedy of injustice against him, he is not new
 


meraa keval yah nivedan hai ki agar hriday se hinsa ko tyaag de to nishkarshtah vah abhyaas se ek shakti srujit karegaa jo ki bade tyaag ki vajah se he
 He responded to the criticisms in "answers to Jewish Friends" and "jews and Palestine", stating that "I asked for a renunciation of violence from the heart that would in practice create a power that is due to great sacrifice
" yahudiyon kii asann aahuti ko lekar gandhi ke bayaan ne kai tikaakaron kii aalochana ko aakarshith kiya
 Martin Buber, himself an opponent of the Jewish state, wrote a sharply critical letter to Gandhi on 24 February 1939
 Buber asserted that the treatment of Indian people by the British was different from the treatment of Jews by the Nazis, in addition, while the Indians were victims of persecution, Gandhi on some occasions supported the use of force
 
 gandhi ne 1930 main germany main yahudiyon ke utpedan ko satyagrah ke bheetar hi sandarbhit kaha
 In November 1938, he suggested a measure of non-violence for Nazi persecution of uprooted Jews: abhas hota he ki yahudiyon ke german utpedan kaa itihaas main koi saamanantar nahi
 puraane jamaane ke taanashaah kabhi itane pagal nahi hue jitna ki hitler hua or ise ve dharmik utsaah ke saath karte hai ki vah ek aise anany dharm or jangi raashtra ko prastut kar rahaa he jiske naam par koi bhi amanviyata maanviyata kaa niyam ban jaati he jise abhi or bhavishya main puruskrit kiya jaayegaa
 jaahir si baat he ki ek pagal parantu nidar yuva dwaara kiya gaya aparaadh sari jati par avishwasaneey ugrata ke saath padegaa
yadi kabhi koi nyaaysangat yuddh maanavtaa ke naam par, to ek puri com ke prati germany ke dheeth utpedan ke khilaaf yuddh ko purna rup se uchit kaha ja saktaa hai
 But i do not believe in any war
 It is not in my jurisdiction to discuss the pros and cons of war
 parantu germany dwaara yahudiyon par kiye gaye is tarah ke aparaadh ke khilaaf yuddh nahi kiya ja saktaa to germany ke saath gathbandhan bhi nahi kiya ja saktaa yah kaise ho saktaa hai ki aise deshon ke bich gathbandhan ho jisame se ek nyaay or prajatantr kaa daawa karata hai or doosraa jise donon kaa dushman ghoshit kar diya gaya he?" Gandhi's early writings on South Africa are quite controversial
 On March 7, 1908, Gandhi wrote in the Indian Opinion about his prison life in South Africa "kafirs are rude in governance - even more as prisoners
 They are annoying
" , Dirty and live almost like animals
 " 1903 main apravas ke vishay ko lekar gandhi ne tippanee kii ki "main maanata hoon ki jitna ve apni jati kii shuddhta par vishwaas karte hai utana ham bhi


ham maanate hai ki dakshin africa main jo gori jati he use hi shreshth jati honi chahie
" dakshin africa main apane samay ke dauraan gandhi ne baar-baar bharatiyon kaa ashweton ke saath saamaajik vargeekaran ko lekar virodh kiya, jinke bare main ve varnan karte hai ki " nisandeh purna rup se kafiron se shreshth hai"
 yah dhyaan dene yogya hai ki gandhi ke samay main kafir kaa vartmaan main istemaal ho rahe arth se ek alag arth tha 
 gandhi ke in kathanon ne unhen kuch logon dwaara nasalwadi hone ke aarope ko lagane kaa mauka diya he
 The two professors of history, Surendra Bhana and Ghulam Vahed, who have mastered the history of South Africa, have examined this controversy in their text, The Making of a Political Reformer: Gandhi in South Africa, 1893–1914

 "at the same time, he says," Gandhi's prison experience made him more sensitive to the situation of those people

 Bhana and Wahed have commented on the events surrounding the unveiling in The Making of a Political Reformer: Gandhi in South Africa, 1913–1914
 anubhag " dakshin africa ke liye gandhi ke viraasat" main ve likhte hai " gandhi ne dakshin africa ke sakriy kaaryakartaaon ke aane vaali pidhiyon ko shwet adhipaty ko khatm karne ke liye prerit kiya
 This legacy connects him to Nelson Mandela
 
maane yah ki jis kam ko gandhi ne shuru kiya tha use mandela ne khatm kiya
 "they continue citing the controversies that arose during the unveiling of Gandhi's statue
 gandhi ke prati in do drushtikonon ke pratikriya swarup, bhaana or vahed tark dete hai : ve log ko dakshin africa main rangabhed ke pashchaat apane rajnatik uddeshy ke liye gandhi ko sahi tehraana chaahate hai ve unke bare main kai tathyon ko najrandaaj karte hue kaaran main kuch zyada madad nahin karte; or jo unhen keval ek naslvaadi kehete hai ve bhi galat bayani ke utane hi doshi hai / vikruti ke utane hi doshi hai
 " gandhi raaj virdohi us rup main the jahaan unka drushtikon us bharat kaa hai jo ki kisi sarkaar ke adheen na ho
 He thought that true self-government in a country meant that each person ruled himself and there was no state that could impose laws on the people

 This did not mean that the administrative structure established by the British should be transferred to the Indians for which they said that India should be made into India
 Having no faith in the parliamentary system of the British way, he wanted to dissolve the Congress party after independence in India and establish a direct democracy system

 The emergence of the Greek alphabet centuries after the fall of the Mycenaean civilization and after the disuse of the earlier Greek writing system, the Linear b script, in the eighth century BC

 Vowel signs were not originally used in the Semitic alphabet
 purvavarti pashchimi simitic lipi parivaar main, ek avishisht swar ke saath vyanjan hetu ek akshar hameshaa prayukt kiya gaya

 In Eastern Greek, which lacked complete pronunciation, the semitic glottal consonant / ħ / ka h) was also used for long vowels / ɛː / and finally Ω) The letter began to be used for long / ɔː / 
 The reason for the inclusion of long open letters e and o lies in oral morphological study of the language

 At the end of the word, similar to the Latin long and heart s, σ was written similarly ς

 This article has been translated from this edition of the Wikipedia article Pythagorean theorem
 pithagoras prameya eucalidia jyamiti main kisi samakon tribhuj ke teenon bhujaaon ke bich ek sambandh bataane vaala prameya he
 This theorem is usually expressed as an equation in the following way- jahaan c samakon tribhuj ke karn kii lambaai he tathaa a or b anya do bhujaaon kii lambaai he
 Pythagoras was a Greek mathematician
 paramparanusaar unhen hi is prameya kii khoj kaa shrey diya jaataa he, haalanki yah mana jane laga he ki is prameya kii jaankaree unase purv tithi kii he
 This theorem is given in the ancient Indian Buddhist Buddhist Shulbasutra
 kaaphi pramaan he ki babylon ke ganitagyon bhi is siddhant ko jaanate the
 It is also called 'boudhayan-pythagoras theorem'
 agar ham karn kii lambaai ko c or anya do bhujaaon kii lambaai ko a or b lete hai, to prameya ko nimnlikhit sameekaran ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he: or, yadi c pehle se diya gaya he or ek bhujaa kii lambaai nikaalnaa ho, to nimnlikhit sameekaran kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he : or yah sameekaran samakon trikon ke teenon bhujaaon ke bich ek saral sambandh pradaan karata he
 The generalization of this theorem is called the 'cosine rule', with the help of which the length of the third side of any triangle can be calculated if the length of the remaining two sides and the angle between them is measured
 yah ek aisa prameya he jiske anya pramayon kii tulana main sambhavtah sarvaadhik pramaan gyaat hai 
 In the book Pythagorean Theorem, composed by Elisha Scott Loomis, 367 evidences are given
 boudhayan prameya ke adhikansh pramaanon kii tarah, yah do samroop tribhujon kii bhujaaon ke samaanupati hone ke gun par aadhaarit he
 Let ABC be a right angled triangle, in which angle c is right angled, as shown in the figure
 ham c bindu se karn par lamb daalate hai or bhujaa AB ke saath us lamb kii lambaai h hai
 This new triangle ACH is similar to our triangle ABC, because they both have right angles and a is their angle
 iskaa matlab he kii teesraa kone bhi donon tribhujon main samaan he
 On this basis, triangle CBH is also similar to ABC
 in samarupataaon se hamen do samaanupaat praapt hote hai: like tathaa They can also be written as in do samikarnon kaa sankshep karne par, In other words, the Boudhayan theorem: euclid ke tatwon main, pustak 1 kaa prastaav 47, boudhayan prameya nimnlikhit linon ke saath ek tark se sabit hota he
 A, B, c are considered the vertices of the right triangle, in which the right angle will be on A
 Drop a perpendicular from a to Karna opposite the square at the hypotenuse
 The line divides the square at the hypotenuse into two imports, each having the same area as one of the two legs being square
 aupchaarik pramaan ke liye, hamen chaar praathmik lemmata kii aavashyaktaa he: The simple idea behind this proof, which can make it easy to follow, is that the two squares above are transformed into a parallelogram of the same size, then folded and the left and right rectangles are converted to the lower squares, then continuous
 In area
 pramaan nimnanusaar he: This proof appears in Euclid's Elements as Proposition 1
47
 james e
 garfield ko ek upanyaas bijiy pramaan dwaara shrey diya gaya he: The entire trapezium is half of the left square, so its area = 2 / 2 = a2 / 2 + b2 / 2 + ab
 trikon 1 or trikon 2 prayek kshetrafal ab / 2 he
 The area of triangle 3 is c2 / 2 and it is half of the square on the hypotenuse
 lekin trikon 3 kaa kshetrafal bhi = - Hence the square on the hypotenuse = the sum of the squares of the other two sides
 is pramaan main, karn par varg plus trikon kii 4 pratiyaan ko anya do parshvon main virgon ke rup main jod sakate hai plus trikon kii 4 pratiyaan
yah pramaan china se darj kii gai he
 From Euclid's proof diagram above, we can see three identical figures, each with a "triangle over a square"
 kyunki bada trikon do chote trikon se bana he, uskaa kshetrafal in do chote kaa jod he
 By analogy, the three squares are in the same ratio with each other as the three triangles and the area of the larger square is the sum of the area of the two smaller squares
 viparyay se pramaan ko chithran or anemeshan ke dwaara diya gaya he
 In this example, the area of each large square is 2
 donon main, charon samaan trikon kaa kshetrafal hataa diya gaya he
 The remaining regions, a2 + b2 and c2, are equal
 Q
E
D This proof is indeed very simple, but it is not preliminary, in the sense that it does not depend only on the most basic theory and theorems of Euclidean geometry
 vishesh rup se, jab trikon or virgon ke kshetrafal kaa sutara dena bahut aasaan he, yah sabit karne ke liye aasaan nahin he ki ek varg kaa kshetrafal uske tukdon ke kshetron kaa jod he
 In fact, proving the necessary properties is harder than proving the Pythagorean theorem
 In fact, this difficulty affects all simple field-involved Euclidean proofs; For example, to get the area of a right-angled triangle involves an assumption that it is half the area of a rectangle of the same height and plane
 isi kaaran se, jyamiti ke liye swayansiddh parichay aam taur par trikon kii samanta ke aadhaar par ek or pramaan kaa prayog karata he 
 In the third graphic illustration of this Pythagorean theorem, the square of the hypotenuse fits the square of the sides
 ek sambandhit pramaan yah dikhaa saktaa he kii punah sthapit bhaag mul ke samaan hai or, kyunki samaan kaa jod samaan he, kii unke kshetra bhi samaan hai
 To show that a square is the result, we have to show the length of the new sides equal to c
 Note that for this proof to work, we need to handle the way to cut a smaller square into more parts
 As the sides become smaller and smaller
 is pramaan kaa bijiy bhinnrup nimna tark dwaara pradaan kiya gaya he
 Looking at the illustration which is a large square with equal right-angled triangles at the corners, the area of each of these four triangles is given by an angle with C
 in trikon ke A-parshv kone or B-parshv kone anupoorak kone hai, nile kshetra ke prayek kone samakon hai, is kshetra ko ek varg banaate hue jiske parshv kii lambaai c he
 The area of this square is C2
 In this way the area of the whole is given: haalanki, bade varg ke parshvon kii lambaai a + B, ham uske kshetrafal kii gananaa kar sakate hai jaise 2, jo A2 + 2AB + B2 main vistaarit hota he
 The Buddhist theorem can be arrived at by studying the following diagram of how a lateral change can produce a change in the hypotenuse and using a small algorithm
 parshv a ke da main parivartan ke parinaam swarup, For a change in the similarity and difference of a triangle
 char ke viyojan par
 The result is the addition of a second term to the change in side b
 samekit detaa he When a = 0 then c = b, then b2 is "continuous"
 isliye As can be seen, this square is due to the special ratio between the changes and the sides, whereas the independent contribution of changes to the sides is the result of an amount that is not clear from geometric proofs
 is die gaye anupaat se yah dikhaaya ja saktaa he kii parshvon main parivartan parshvon se pratipanupati anupaat hai
 This differential equation suggests that this theorem is due to the related transform and its derivation is almost identical to the line integral computation
 yah maatra da or dc kramshah a or c main atyant chote parivartan hai
 But we use the real numbers Δa and Δc instead, then the ratio of their ratio is da / dc when their size is zero proximity, derivative and c / a are also close, the ratio of the length of the sides of the triangle and the result of the differential equation
 It shows
 is prameya kaa viparyaay bhi sach he: For any three positive numbers a, b and c such that a2 + b2 = c2, there exists a triangle whose sides are a, b and c and every triangle has a right angle between the sides whose lengths are a and b
 yah viparyaay euclid ke tatwon main maujuud hota he
 This can be proved by using the cosine method, or by the following proof: ABC ko ek trikon maanate hai jiske parshvon kii lambaai a, b or c he, a2 + b2 = c2 ke saath
hamen yah sabit karnaa he ki a or b parshvon ke bich ke kone samakon he
 We construct another triangle in which there is a right angle between the sides whose length is a and b
 paaythagorian prameya se, nimnanusaar he ki is trikon ke karn lambaai bhi c he
 Since the sides of the two triangles have the same length, a, b and c, they are congruent and therefore must have the same angle
 Therefore, the sides that have length a and b in our original triangle have a right angle between them
 paaythagorian prameya ke viparyaay kaa ek anumaan he kii nirdhaaran karne kaa ek saral tarika he kii yadi ek trikon samakon, obtyus, yaa acute he, is prakaar se
jahaan c ko teenon parshvon main lanbaa chunaa gaya he: a Pythagorean triple has three positive integers a, b and c, such as a2 + b2 = c2
 In other words, a Pythagorean triple describes the length of the sides of a right angle where the integer length of all three sides is
 uttari europe ke bade pattharon se bane smarakon se sakshya yah dikhaate hai ki aise tripal likhane kii khoj se pehle se jane jaanate the
 Such triples are commonly written
 Some famous examples are and ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , One of the results of the Pythagorean theorem is that the unstructured length, such as the square root of 2, can be constructed
 ek samakon jiske pair donon ek ikai ke baraabar hai uske karn kii lambaai 2 kaa vargamul he
 The proof that the square root of 2 is irrational was contrary to the long-held belief that everything was rational

 The distance formula in Cartesian coordinates is derived from the Pythagorean theorem
 agar or chauras main ank hai, to unke bich kii duuri, jise yucalidian duuri bhi kaha jaataa he, jo diya jaataa he More generally, the Euclidean n-difference, the Euclidean distance between two points, a = { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle a \ , = \ ,} and a = { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle a \ , = \ ,}, the Pythagorean theorem Is defined, using: euclid ke tatwon main boudhayan prameya ko saamanyakrit kiya gaya tha: If one erects a similar figure on the sides of a right triangle, then the sum of the areas of the two smaller ones is equal to the area of the larger
 boudhayan prameya, parshvon kii lambaai se sambandhit adhik saamaanya prameya kaa ek vishesh cese he, kosine kii vidhi: If two vectors v and w are given in this complex inner product space, then the Buddhism theorem takes the following form: vishesh rup se,||v + w||2 =||v||2 +||w||2 agar v or w ayty hai, haalanki viparyaay kaa sach hona zaruri nahin he

 ) For example, in spherical geometry, the length of the three sides of a right-angled triangle of unit area limited by octet is equal to π / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi / 2}; Euclidean violates the Pythagorean theorem because π / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi / 2} iskaa matlab he kii bina yucalidian prameya main, paaythagorian prameya ko yucalidian prameya se ek alag rup lenaa chahie

 Using the mclaurin series for this cosine function, it can be shown that the radius r reaches infinity, as it is, the spherical form of the Pythagorean theorem approaches the Euclidean form

 The Pythagoras formula is used to find the distance between two digits in a Cartesian coordinate plane and is valid if all the coordinates are real: digits {2 + 2)
 But with complex coordinates: examples, digits {and {i The distance between, 0} will remain zero, which results in redactio ad Absurdum
 This is because this formula relies on the theorem of Pythagoras, which in his Huss proofs, depends on the area
 Is su and the area depends on the triangle and on other geometric figures that separate the inside from outside, which would not have been possible if the coordinates were complex
