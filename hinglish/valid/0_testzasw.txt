 According to epidemiologists studying diet and serum levels, high levels of beta carotene, predisposed to vitamin A, are associated with a protective effect that reduces the risk of cancer
 yah prabhaav vishesh rup se fefdon ke cancer main adhik prabal he
 Based on this hypothesis, several clinical trials were conducted in Finland and the United States in a series during the 1980s and 1990s
 is adhyayan main 80,000 dhumrapaan karne waalon yaa purv dhumrapaan waalon ko placebo yaa beta-caroten kaa dainik poorak aahaar uplabdh karaayaa gaya
 Contrary to expectation, the dietary supplementation of beta carotene given during this trial did not play a role in reducing the incidence or mortality of pleural cancer
 In fact, with beta-carotene, the risk of lung cancer was not very high but very low, which ended the initial study here
 jarnal of american medical association kii 2007 main di gai report ke parinaam suchit karte hai ki folic amla ke poorak aahaar badi aant ke cancer ko rokane main prabhavi nahin hai or folate kaa upbhog karne waalon main badi aant ke polip ke banane kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he
 It is a fascinating concept that drugs can be used to prevent cancer and many high-grade clinical trials recommend that such chemical prevention should be used in special circumstances
 praroopik rup se 5 varsh ke liye ek chaynaatmak estrogen receptor modulator, temoxiphen kaa dainik upyog ucch jokhim yukt mahilaon main stan cancer ke khatre ko lagbhag 50% tak kam kar detaa he
 According to a recent study report the selective estrogen receptor modulator raloxifene is also beneficial like tamoxifen and reduces the risk of breast cancer in high-risk women
 The profile of its side effects is more favorable
 reloxifen temoxiphen kii tarah ek SERM he; ucch jokhim yukt mahilaon main stan cancer ke khatre ko kam karne main yah temoxiphen ke samaan hi prabhavi paaya gaya he
 In this trial studied on approximately 20,000 women, the lateral effects of raloxifene are less than those of tamoxifen, although it promotes the process to produce more DCIS

 a canyon melanoma vaccine has also been developed
 cancer screening ek prayaas he jo lakshan hin aabaadi main shankaahin cancer kii jaanch ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Appropriate screening tests for a large number of healthy people should be relatively cheap, safe, their procedure should not be contagious, the rate of positive false results should be very low
 agar cancer ke lakshan pataa lagate hai, to nidaan ko sunishchit karne ke liye adhik nishchit pareekshan kiye jate hai
 Screening for cancer is helpful in early diagnosis in special cases

 Over time, the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer has decreased due to such tests
 15 varsh kii aayu main shuruyaat main shukr granthi cancer kii jaanch ke liye shukr granthi swayan pariksha kii salaah di jaati he
 Prostate cancer screening can be performed using a prostate specific antigen blood test, along with a digital rectal examination, although some official institutions are against such screening in all men
 cancer ke liye screening kai maamalon main vivaad kaa vishay he, jab tak yah pataa na ho ki pareekshan vastav main jivan ko bachaayegaa
vivaad or adhik bad jaataa he jab yah spasht na ho ki screening ke laabh naidanik pareekshanon or cancer ke upachaaron ke sambhavi jokhim se adhik prabhavi hai
 For example: At the time of prostate cancer screening, the PSA test can detect small cancers that never become fatal for life, but have to begin treatment once detected
 yah sthiti ati nidaan kehalaati he, jo purush ko anaavashyak upachaar jaise shalya chikitsa or vikiran kii jatiltaaon kaa saamana karne ke liye majaboor kar detii he
 The procedures used to diagnose prostate cancer can be the cause of side effects including blood flow and infection
 prostate cancer kaa ilaaj asanyam or langik niskriyata kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Similarly, for breast cancer, it has recently been criticized that breast screening programs in some countries exacerbate rather than solve problems
 aisa isliye he ki saamaanya jansankhya main mahilaon main screening kai abhaasi dhanatmak parinaam de sakati he, jinhen agrim jaanch kii zarurat hoti he, jisaki vajah se stan cancer ke keval ek hi maamle kaa pataa lagane or uske upachaar ke liye bahut badi sankhya main mahilaon kaa upachaar kiya jaataa he
 According to a public health perspective, cervical cancer screening through pap smears is more beneficial in price than all other types of cancer, it is largely caused by a virus, there are obvious risk factors, such as cancer
 The natural way of spreading is that it usually spreads slowly over many years, so the screening program can quickly catch it
 To take more time
 iske alaava, pareekshan apane aap main sasta or bahut hi aasaan he
 For these reasons, it is important to consider the benefits and risks of the diagnostic process and treatment when considering cancer screening
 spasht lakshanon ke abhaav yukt logon main cancer ke liye medical imaging kaa upyog, samaan rup se samasya janak he
 Recently discovered incidenataloma has a high risk of screening — a benign lesion that can be considered malignant and may be potentially dangerous for it

 Epidermic clinical trials of plain-film chest X-rays that screen for lung cancer in smokers have not proved to be beneficial for this approach
 canin cancer kii jaanch ke sateek parinaam hote hai, lekin yah abhi bhi anusandhan ke praarambhik charan main he
 Most cancers are either identified early by their symptoms and signs or appear during screening
 inamen se koi bhi nishchit nidaan nahin he, jise aam taur par ek rogavigyaani kii salaah kii zarurat hoti he, yah rog vigyaani ek prakaar kaa physician hona chahie jo cancer or anya rogon ke nidaan main maahir he
 Those who are suspected of cancer are examined by medical examination
 isamen saamaanya hai rakt pareekshan, eks kiran, siti scan or antahdarshan 
 Cancer can be suspected for a number of reasons, but the definitive diagnosis of most malignancies should be ensured by a pathologist through tissue scientific testing of cancer cells
 biopsy yaa shalya chikitsa ke dwaara utak ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Many biopsies can be performed in a physician's office
 anya angon kii biopsy ek nishchetak kii upasthiti main kii jaati he, iske liye shalya chikitsa ke kaksh main shalya kriya kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The tissue diagnosis given by the pathologist explains the type of cell proliferating
 saath hi gaanth kii utak vaigyanik shrenee, anuvanshik asaamanyataon or anya lakshanon ko bhi spasht karte hai
 Also, this information is useful in evaluating the patient's prior diagnosis and choosing the best treatment
 koshika anuvanshiki or pratiraksha utak rasayan vigyaan pareekshan ke anya prakaar hai jo ek rog vigyaani ek utak ke namoonay par kar saktaa he
 These tests can provide information about the molecular changes that have taken place in the cancer cell and thus indicate the future behavior and best treatment of the cancer
 cancer kaa upachaar shalya chikitsa, rasochikitsa, vikiran chikitsa, pratiraksha chikitsa, monochlonal antibody chikitsa yaa anya vidhiyon ke dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 The choice of therapy depends on the condition and range of the knot and the stage of the disease, as well as the general state of the patient
 Many experimental cancer treatments are also being developed
 sharir ko nuksaan pahuchaye bina cancer ko puri tarah se khatm karnaa upachaar kaa uddeshy hota he
 Sometimes this can be done surgically, but the tendency of the cancer to invade nearby tissue or spread to distant locations by microscopic metastasis often limits its effectiveness
 chemotherapy kii prabhaavashiltaa aksar sharir main anya utakon ke vishikaran ke dwaara simit ho jaati he
 Radiation can also damage normal tissues
 kyonki "cancer" kaa sandarbh rogon ke ek varg se he, aisa sambhav nahin he ki "cancer kaa hameshaa ek maatr upachaar" hi rahegaa, phir bhi sabhi sankramak rogon ke liye ek hi upachaar hota he
 Theoretically, non-hematological cancer can be treated if it is completely removed by surgery, but this is not always possible
 jab cancer shalya chikitsa se pehle hi metastasis ke dwaara sharir ke anya angon tak pahunch jaataa he, tab puri tarah se shalya kriya dwaara ise hataa dena aam taur par asambhav hota he
 In the halted sample of cancer progression, the knot grows spatially, then spreads to the lymph nodes, and then to all other parts of the body
 For this reason, the popularity of endemic treatments such as surgery for small cancers has increased
 yahan tak ki chote sthaniyakrut tumor main bhi metastasis kii bahut adhik kshamta hoti he
 Examples of surgical procedures for cancer include - breast amputation for breast cancer and prostate-piercing for prostate cancer
 The goal of surgery is to either remove the knot or remove the entire organ
 a cancer cell is invisible to the naked eye, but can then grow into a new knot, a process known as recurrence
 is kaaran ke liye, rogavigyaani shalya kriya se nikaale gaye namoonay kii jaanch karte hai, yadi swasth utak kii seemaa upasthit he, to is baat kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he ki sookshm cancer kii koshikayen rogi ke sharir main rah gai hai
 In addition to the removal of the primary knot, surgery is often required for stage determination eg determining the extent of the disease and determining whether it has reached the regional lymph nodes via metastasis
 avasthaa nirdhaaran purv nidaan kaa mukhya nirdharak he or sahyogi chikitsa kii aavashyaktaa bhi he
 Often, surgery is necessary to control symptoms such as spinal cord compression or bowel obstruction
 ise shaman upachaar ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Radiation therapy uses ionizing radiation to destroy cancer cells and compressed lumps
 vikiran chikitsa ko bahya kiran radiotherapy ke dwaara baahar se hi niyantrit kiya jaataa he yaa brekitherapy ke dwaara andar se niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 The effect of radiation therapy is localized and limited to the area to be treated
 vikiran chikitsa, ilaaj kiye jane vaale kshetra kii koshikaon ko kshatigrast karti he yaa nasht kar detii he, is kriya main in koshikaon ke anuvanshik padaarth ko nasht kar diya jaataa he taaki koshikaon main aage vibhaajan or vruddhi na ho paae
yadhyapi vikiran cancer kii koshikaon or saamaanya koshikaon donon ko nasht kar dete hai, adhikansh saamaanya koshikaayen vikiran ke prabhaav se ubar aati hai or thik prakaar se kaary karne lagati hai
 The goal of radiation therapy is to destroy as many cancer cells as possible, while limiting damage to nearby healthy tissue
 isliye, yah kai bhaagon main di jaati he jisase bich kii avadhi main swasth utakon ko thik hone kaa mauka mil jaataa he
 Radiation therapy can be used to treat almost every type of solid lump, including cancers of the brain, breast, cervix, larynx, lung, pancreas, prostate, skin, abdomen, uterus, or soft tissue sarcoma
 
 leukemia or limphoma ke upachaar main bhi vikiran chikitsa kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 The radiation dose for each site depends on many factors, these factors are, the radio sensitivity of each type of cancer and whether the surrounding tissue or organs can be destroyed by radiation
 is prakaar, har prakaar ke upachaar main, vikiran chikitsa iske parshv dushprabhavon ke bina nahin he
 Cancer treatment of cancer is done in medicines which can destroy cancer cells
 vartmaan upyog main, shabd "rasochikitsa" kaa upyog un cytotoxic yaa koshikavishi dawaaon ke liye kiya jaataa he jo lakshith chikitsa ke vipareet, saamaanya rup main tezi se vibhajit hoti hui koshikaon ko prabhavit karti hai
 
 Rheumatic drugs inhibit cell division in various possible ways, for example by replication of DNA or segregation of newly formed chromosomes
 Most forms of chemotherapy target all cells that rapidly divide, specific only to cancer cells
 Are not, although some specificity is due to the fact that most cancer cells are not capable of repairing DNA damage
 Whereas normal cells typically have these abilities
 atah, rasochikitsa main swasth utakon ko nuksaan pahunchane kii kshamta hoti he, vishesh rup se ve utak jinamein ucch pratisthaapan dar hoti he 
ye koshikaayen aamtaur par rasochikitsa ke baad apni marammat kar leti hai
 Because some drugs work better together than alone, two or more drugs are given at the same time
 ise "sangyojan rasochikitsa" kaha jaataa he; adhikansh rasochikitsa regimen ek sangyojan main hi die jate hai
 Treatment of some types of leukemia and lymphoma requires high doses of chemotherapy or whole body decompression
 yah upachaar asthi majja ko alag kar detaa he or isliye sharir kii thik hone or rakt ke punarniman kii kshamta pruthakkrut ho jaati he
 For this reason, bone marrow, or peripheral blood column cell harvesting is performed before the ablation effect of therapy so that "rescue" is possible after treatment
 ise autologus stem koshika pratyaropan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Alternatively, hematopoietic stem cells taken from a matched unrelated donor can be transplanted
 lakshith therapy jo 1990 ke dashak ke ant main sabase pehle uplabdh hui, kaa kai prakaar ke cancer ke upachaar main mukhya prabhaav tha or vartmaan main yah ek bahut hi adhik sakriy anusandhan kshetra he
 This includes the use of factors that are specialized to unregulate the proteins of cancer cells
 chote anu lakshith upachaar dawaayein aamtaur par cancer koshikaon ke bheetar utparivartit, ati abhivyakt, yaa anya jatil proteinon par anzymetic domen kii sandamak hoti hai
 Major examples are the thyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib and zefitinib
 monochlonal pratirakshi chikitsa ek anya ranneeti he jisamen upachaar kaa kaarak ek pratirakshi hota he jo cancer koshikaon kii sataha par ek protein ke saath vishesh rup se bandha bana letaa he
 Examples include anti-her2 / neu antibody trastuzumeb used in breast cancer and anti-cd-20 antibody rituximeb used in many types of B-cell malignancies
 lakshith therapy main "homing yukti" ke rup main chote peptid bhi shaamil ho sakate hai, jo gaanth ke chaaron ore prabhavit bahya koshiki matrix ke saath yaa koshika kii sataha par grahi ke saath baandh bana sakate hai
 Radio nuclides that are attached to these peptides eventually kill the cancer cell if the nucleus is decomposing around the cell
 vishesh rup se in bandhit padaarthon ke oligo- yaa multimers bahut mahatvapurn hote hai, chunki ve gaanth kii vishistataa or uthkanthaa ko badhaate hai
 Photodynamic therapy is a triple treatment for cancer that includes photosensitizers, tissue oxygen, and light
 PDT kaa upyog aadhari koshika carcinoma yaa fefdon ke cancer ke upachaar ke liye kiya jaataa he; PDT bade tumor ko shalya chikitsa ke dwaara hataa die jane ke baad durdam utak ke bache hue avasheshon ko hataane main bhi upyogi ho saktaa he
 Cancer immune therapy is a group of different medical strategies designed to induce a patient's own immune system to fight the knot
 gaanth ke khilaaf pratirakshi pratikriya utpann karne ke liye kai vidhiyaan hai, ye hai, satahi mutrashi cancer ke liye antar dhaneey BCG pratiraksha chikitsa, tathaa vrikk koshika carcinoma or melanoma ke rogiyon main pratirakshi pratikriya prerit karne ke liye interferon or anya cytokine kaa upyog
 kai prakaar kii ganthon, khaas taur par durdam melanoma or vrikk koshika carcinoma, ke liye vishisht pratiraksha pratikriya utpann karne ke liye vexinon par gahan anusandhan kiya ja rahaa he
 cephalucal-t is a vaccine-like strategy used in modern clinical trials for prostate cancer, in which thrushmash cells taken from the patient are loaded with prostatic acid phosphatase peptides to induce a specific immune response against prostate-derived cells
 To be
 elloginenic hemetopoctic stem koshika pratyaropan ko pratiraksha therapy kaa ek rup mana ja saktaa he, kyonki daata kii pratiraksha koshikaayen grapht-banaam-gaanth prabhaav ke tahat gaanth par aksar akraman karti hai
 Therefore, allogeneic HSCT causes higher rates of treatment than autologous transplants for many types of cancer, although side effects are also more severe
 kuch cancer kii vruddhi ko vishesh hormonon ko uplabdh kara kar yaa avaruddh karke sandamit kiya ja saktaa he
 Some common examples of hormone sensory lumps are - specific types of breast and prostate cancer
 Removing or blocking estrogen or testosterone is often an important additional treatment
 vishesh prakaar ke canceron main, hormone kaa prashasan shithil ho jaataa he, jaise projestogen chikitsa kii drushti se laabhakaari ho saktaa he
 Angiogenesis that is required for the tumor to survive
 kuch, jaise bevasizumeb, ko manyata de di gayi he or chikitsakeey upyog main inkaa upyog kiya ja rahaa he
 a main problem with anti-angiogenesis drugs is that many factors stimulate the growth of blood vessels in normal and cancerous cells
 angiogenesis virdohi dawaaye keval ek hi kaarak ko lakshya banaati hai, isliye anya kaarak rakt vahini kii vruddhi ko uttejit karnaa jari rakhte hai
 Other problems include route of administration, maintenance of stability and action and targeting on tumor vasculature
 yadhyapi cancer ke lakshanon par niyantran ko cancer kaa upachaar nahin mana ja saktaa he, yah cancer rogiyon kii jivan kii gunvattta kaa ek mahatvapurn nirdharak he or is faisle main mukhya bhoomika nibhaataa he ki rogi anya upachaar ke liye sakasham he yaa nahin
 Although doctors have the therapeutic skills to reduce pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding, and other common problems in cancer patients, this group of patients responds to the needs of symptom control in a multi-disciplinary manner of palliative care
 Specialty has evolved
 dard kii dawaaye, jaise ki morphine or oxicodon or michali or ulti ko rokane ke liye antiemetics dawaaen, cancer se sambandhit lakshanon se yukt rogiyon main aam taur par kaam main lee jaati hai
 Sophisticated antiemetics such as ondansetron and analogues, as well as aprapitant, have made radical treatment more likely in cancer patients
 cancer ke kaaran purana dard hameshaa satat utak kshati ke kaaran hota he jo rog yaa upachaar prakriya se sambandhit he yadhyapi paryaavarniya karkon or dard ke vyavhaar ke utpaadan main prabhavi gadbadi kii bhi bhoomika hoti he, cancer ke dard se yukt rogiyon main aam taur par pramukh ityologic kaaran nahin hote hai
 Furthermore, most patients with severe cancer-related pain are in the late stages of their lives and need palliative therapy
 mudde jaise nashile padaarthon ke upyog kaa saamaajik kalank, kaam or kaaryaatmak sthiti or swasthya dekhbhaal, samgr maamle ke prabandhan main adhik mahatvapurn nahin hai
 Therefore, the specific strategy for cancer pain management is to try to get maximum comfort to the patient by the use of narcotics and other drugs, surgical and physical methods
 doctor cancer ke antim sthiti ke rogiyon main dard ke liye maadak padaarthon kaa upyog nahin karnaa chaahate hai kyon ki isse unhen isaki lat ho sakati he yaa unki shwaas kriya main baadha aa sakati he
 Palliative care is a new branch of the care movement that provides more comprehensive support in the treatment of pain in cancer patients
 thakaan cancer rogiyon ke liye ek bahut hi aam samasya he or haal hi main cancer chikitsa vigyaniyon ke liye iskaa upachaar bahut mahatvapurn ban gaya he, yadhyapi yah kai rogiyon main jivan kii gunvattta ko lekar mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Clinical trials, also called research studies, also test new treatments in cancer patients
 is shodh kaa lakshya he cancer ke ilaaj ke liye behatar tareeke khojna or cancer rogiyon kii madad karnaa
 Clinical trials test a range of therapies such as new drugs, new approaches to surgery or radiation therapy, new combinations of treatments, or new methods such as gene therapy
 ek naidanik pareekshan, ek lambi or satark cancer anusandhan kii prakriya ke antim charnon main se ek he
 The search for new treatments begins in the laboratory, where scientists first test and develop new ideas
 agar ek drushtikon upyogi prathit hota he to aglaa kadam hota he iskaa jaanavar par pareekshan, jo yah bataata he ki cancer rogi par iskaa kya prabhaav hoga or iske koi hanikaarak prabhaav hai yaa nahin
 Of course, many treatments that work well in the laboratory or in animals do not always prove effective in humans
 upyogi maane jane vaale upachaar surakshit or prabhavi hai yaa nahin, iskaa pataa lagane ke liye cancer ke rogiyon main adhyayan kiye jate hai
 It may be that the patient participating in this treatment will personally get help from this treatment
 ve cancer visheshgyon se aadhuniktam suraksha praapt karte hai or ve yaa to jaanch kiya ja rahaa nayaa ilaaj praapt karte hai yaa cancer ke liye sarvottam uplabdh maanak upachaar praapt karte hai
 Also, new treatments may carry unknown risks, but if new treatments prove effective or more effective than standard treatments, the patient studied becomes the first person to receive its benefit
 is baat kii koi guarantee nahin he ki pareekshan kiya jane vaala nayaa upachaar yaa ek maanak upachaar achche parinaam degaa
 In children with cancer, a survey showed that children who underwent such testing did not, on average, see better or worse outcomes than standard treatments; This ensures that the success or failure of any experimental treatment cannot be predicted
 poorak or vaikalpik chikitsa upachaar, chikitsa, swasthya raksha pranaaliyon, prathaon or utpaadon ke vividh samooh hai, jo parmparik chikitsa ke bhaag nahin hai
 "complementary medicine" refers to the methods and substances used in conjunction with traditional medicine
 jabaki "vaikalpik chikitsa" kaa arth un yogicon se he jinka upyog parmparik chikitsa ke sthaan par kiya jaataa he
 The use of CAM is common in people with cancer; a study conducted in 2000 found that 69% of cancer patients used at least one CAM therapy as part of their cancer treatment
 cancer ke liye zyaadaatar poorak or vaikalpik chikitsaaon kaa kathor adhyayan yaa pareekshan nahin kiya gaya he
 Some alternative treatments, which have been investigated and are ineffective, are being marketed and encouraged

 There are usually no questions on radiation therapy, and there is always a risk of miscarriage and congenital malformations in chemotherapy
 bachche par chikitsa ke prabhaavon ke bare main bahut kam gyaat he
 Even a drug that has been tested that it does not reach the baby through the placenta, some forms of cancer can damage the placenta and the drug goes through it
 twachaa cancer ke kuch rup metastasis ke dwaara bachche ke sharir main bhi pravesh kar sakate hai
 Diagnosis has also become more difficult, since computed tomography is infeasible because of its high radiation dose
 phir bhi, chumbakeey anunaad imaging saamaanya rup se kaam karata he
 However the opposite media cannot be used, as they cross the placenta
 garbhavastha ke dauraan cancer ke thik prakaar se nidaan or upachaar main aane vaali kathinaaiyon ke ek parinaam ke rup main, vaikalpik tareekon kaa istamaal kiya jaataa he, isamen yaa to adhik ugr cancer upachaar shuru karne ke liye ek sijerian section kaa upyog kiya jaataa he yaa yadi cancer itnaa adhik durdam ho chukaa he ki maa ke ilaaj main or deree nahin kii ja sakati he to cancer kaa upachaar karne ke liye garbhpaat kar diya jaataa he
 Sometimes, the fetal nodes are diagnosed while staying in the uterus
 terratoma bhrun tumor kaa sabase aam prakaar he or aamtaur par saumy hota he
 Cancer is known as a fatal disease
 haalanki yah baat nishchit rup se vishesh prakaaron par hi lagu hoti he, cancer ke aitihaasik tathyon ke peeche chuphi hui sachai chikitsa kshetra main aadhunikeekaran ke kaaran badal gai he
 Some types of cancer have been found to have symptoms that are better than some other diseases such as heart failure and heart attack
 pragatisheel or teji se failte hue durdam rog kaa cancer rogi ke jivan kii gunvattta par kaaphi prabhaav padataa he or kai cancer upachaar ke gambhir parshv dushprabhav ho sakate hai
 In advanced stages of cancer, many patients require extensive care, affecting their family members and friends
 prashamak dekhbhaal samaadhaan main sthaayee yaa "raahat" dharmashala nursing shaamil ho sakati he
 Many local organizations provide a range of practical support and services for cancer patients
 ye sevaayen hai sahaayta samooh, paraamarsh, salaah, vittiya sahaayta, upachaar ke sthaan se or vahaan tak parivahan, cancer ke bare main jaankaree yaa filmein
