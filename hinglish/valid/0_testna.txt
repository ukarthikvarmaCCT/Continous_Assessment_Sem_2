 Template: Grammatical categories Grammatical tense is a periodic linguistic quality of expressing the position or time of a verb by, during, or beyond the verb
 kaal bhav, awaz or pahalu ke saath, chaar gunon main se kam se kam ek he, jo abhivyakti spasht kar sakate hai
 Tenses reflect the contrast of occasional references to the development of an expression
 sabhi bhashaaen samaan kaal istemaal karti hai - vartmaan, bhoot or bhavishya, haalanki hameshaa in kaalon kii abhivyakti kaa anuwaad spasht rup se ek bhashaa se duusari bhashaa main nahin kiya ja saktaa
 jabaki sabhi bhashaaon main kriya ke theth rup hote hai jiske dwaara ve shabdkoshon main pahachaane jate hai or krambaddh kiye jate hai, saadharantah sabase aam vartmaan kaal yaa ek saadhaaran rup, unke kaal abhivyakt karne ke tareekon kaa istemaal, bhashaaon ke bich bhinn he
 There are some languages in which tense is not interlinked through the verb form nor expressed structurally, but instead, whenever needed, the underlying adverb is intertwined with the use of adjectives and some contain topical information
 Appears by the use of intransitive adjectives
 kuch bhashaaon main pahalu or kaal par ek saath sanket karne ke liye ek ekal kriya antahkunchit kii ja sakati he
 The number of tenses in a language can be disputed, as the tense noun is often mistaken for displaying occasional expressions, extra facets and even expressions
 kai granthon main, kaal shabd galati se anischitata, aavruti, nishpatti, avadhi, sambhaavna kii gunvattta ko sanderbhit karata he or yahan tak ki ise bhi ki kya jaankaree anubhav se vyutpann hoti he yaa afvaah se 
 yah vastav main kaal nahin hai, lekin paramparaagat namapaddati aksar unka aise vargeekaran karti he
 In reality, all languages have the same tenses
 ye aam taur par teen samoohon main vibhajit hote hai - vartmaan, bhoot or bhavishya, jisamen ek nirdhaarit abhipraay main prayek shrenee baddh hota he
 For example, past tenses are those in which the occasional reference to the component verb occurs before the occasional reference to the statement itself
 bhoot kaal, saamaanya ateet / bhoot se lekar tatkaal ateet / bhoot, sudur yaa dur sudur ateet / bhoot tak bhi shrenee baddh ho saktaa he, inke bich sirf ek hi antar hota he or vah he, samayik sandarbh binduon ke bich ghatnakram par duuri
 In English, tense is divided into two types of groups - pure tense and verb tense
 Pure tense refers to the manifestations of the present, past and future in which the secondary topical context is considered absolutely certain or known
 duusare shabdon main, shuddh kaal un abhivyaktiyon ko sanderbhit karata he jinamein anupramann sach mana yaa janaa jaataa he
 On the other hand, verb gesture refers to the manifestations of present, past, or future in which the certainty of attestation is not completely certain
 angrezi main yah rup ek kriyabhaav dyotak, kriyabhaav dyotak kahawat yaa kriyabhaav dyotak kriya-visheshan jodne se abhivyakt kiye jate hai
 The past tense is expressed only in English by subtracting the verb
 sabhi kachche or achook pahaluon main, bhoot kaal pheravat rup main abhimukhataa poorak, tha / the, hona ) ke paroksh rup ke istemaal se abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 In non-periodic aspects, the past tense can be expressed through a special intransitive form in which the element verb has been used indirectly, except for the aspectual complement 'done'
 yah rup keval kuch hi sakaaratmak vyakhyanon main sambhav he
 In all other types of utterances, the inflection form must be employed
 vartmaan kaal bhoot kaal ke saamaan ek achihnit rup ke dwaara abhivyakt kiya jaataa he, lekin isamen abhimukhataa poorak keval pheravat roopon main vyakti or sankhya he / hai, he / he ) ke saath samjhaute ke liye hi manaa kiye jate hai
 Interpreted forms, as with past tense, can be used for some positive lectures
 angrezi main shuddh bhavishya kaal vartmaan kaal kii tarah hi abhivyakt kiya jaataa he lekin ek bhavishya -chihnak kriya-visheshan yaa samay padbandh ke saath
 In English, the adverb denotative tense is expressed either by the use of a fully accepted adverb denotative form or by an additional adverb denotative adverb or a pure tense form with a phrase
 In English, the verb dative sign is most often used to express the future tense
 kriyabhaav dyotak bhavishya aath bhavishya roopon main se kisi ko bhi sanderbhit karata he jisamen bhavishya parinaamon ke anishchit swaroop ke kaaran anupramann ko sach nahin kaha ja saktaa
 yah rup nischitata ke hisaab se bhinn hote hai or hameshaa ek sahaayak manodasha ke abhipraay ke bheetar bhavishya nischitata kaa vah str abhivyakt karte hai
 The following list shows examples of tense expressions in some indo-european and finno-arjic periods using the verb "go"
 kaal mote taur par vartmaan, bhoot, yaa bhavishya ke rup main vargeekrut kiye gaye hai
 Several possible periods exist within these broad classifications
 in kaalon ke bich antar mukhya rup se kathan ke samay se samayik duuri kii degree kaa he
 For example, within the general category of the past tense, the immediate past, the distant past, the distant past and the distant past may exist, the difference being only the increase in the distance from the time of the narration to the narration
 kuch bhashaaen keval bhoot, vartmaan or bhavishya ke bich hi bhed nahin karti, balki gair-bhoot, gair-vartmaan, gair-bhavishya ke bich main bhi
 baad ke donon kaal pehle ke do sammilit karte hai, bina spasht kiye ki ve koun sa kar rahe hai

 Variable frequency drive is a type of variable speed drive that is used in abundance nowadays to change the speed of AC machines
 chaal badalane ke liye yah drive, motor ko di jane vaali vidyut-shakti kaa voltata or aavriti dono ko saath-saath badalata he 
 Often the ratio of voltage and frequency is kept constant
 
 Many motors that are driven by a fixed frequency supply cost less energy if they are driven by a variable frequency drive
 udhaaharan ke liye parivarti-balaghurna vaale centripital pankhons evam pampon main VFD se supplai dene se urja kii vishesh bachat hoti he
 This is because the force and power of these loads are proportional to the square of the speed and the cube of the speed, respectively
 iskaa matlab yah he ki thodi si chaal ghataane se balaghurna main bahut kam kami aati he jabaki shakti main bahut adhik kami aa jaati he
 For example a motor at 63% speed consumes only 25% power
 vishesh baat yah he ki vishwa kii kul urja khapat kaa 60-65% bijli kii khapat motaron main hoti he jiskaa 75% parivarti-balaghurna vaale pankhe, pump, compressure aadi hai
 So if they are not supplied from fixed frequency and supplied with variable frequency drive, then a huge amount of energy will be saved

 Currently, manufacturers in the European Union, the United States, Canada, Japan, and many other countries require special certification to allow them to sell the diet as "organic" within their borders
 Most certifications allow the use of certain chemicals and pesticides, so consumers should be aware of the standards based on which foods are considered "organic" in their respective sites

 trailang swami ek hindu yogi the, jo apane aadhyatmik shaktiyon ke liye prasiddh hue
 They resided in Varanasi
 inaki bengal main bhi badi manyata he, jahaan ye apni yogic aevam aadhyatmik shaktiyon evam lambii aayu ke liye prasiddh rahe hai
 According to some known facts, Tralang Swami lived to be around 300 years, in which he lived in Varanasi from 1737-1887
 inhen bhagwaan shiv kaa evam ramakrishna kaa avatar mana jaataa he
 At the same time, he has also been given the title of Shiva wandering due to Varanasi
 trailang swami kaa janm nrisingh raav or vidyavati ke ghar 1601 ko hua tha
 He served his parents till the age of 52 years
 jab inaki mata kaa swargvaas hua tab ye guru kii khoj main nikle
 He started his practice from the local cremation ground and practiced austerities there for 20 years
 iske baad ye kai sthanon main ghume or nepal hote hue antatah varanasi pahunche
 They lived there for about 150 years
 pus maah kii ekadshi 1881 ko inhone nashwar sharir choda
 Tralang Swami Lahiri was a great friend of Mahasya
 unke sambandh main kaha jaataa he ki ve 300 varsh se bhi adhik aayu tak jivit rahe
 He weighed 300 pounds
 dono yogi praayah ek saath dhyaan main baitha karte the
 Many things are said in relation to the miracles of Tralang Swami
 anek baar ghaatak vish kaa paan karne ke baad bhi ve jivit rahe
 Many people saw him descending into the waters of the Ganges
 kai dino tak ve ganga main jal ke upar baithe rahete the athwa lambe samay tak jal ke neeche chhipe rahete the
 He used to sit motionless on the hot rocks of the Manikarnika Ghat even in the middle of summer
 in chamatkaaro ke dwaara ve yah siddh karnaa chaahate the ki manushya ishwar-chaitanya ke dwaara hi jivit rahata he
 Death could not touch them
 aadhyatmik kshetra main to trailang swami teevrgati vaale the hi unka sharir bhi bahut vishaal tha kintu ve bhojan yada kada hi karte the
 He had become illusionary and had experienced this world as a vision of the mind of God
 ve yah jaanate the ki yah sharir dhaneebhoot shakti ke kaary sadhak aakaar atirikt kuch nahin he
 Therefore, they used the body as they wanted
 trailang swami sadaa nagn rahaa karte the kintu unhe apni nagnavastha kaa tanik bhi bhaan nahin hota tha
 The police was cautious about his childhood
 at: unhe pakadakar police ne jail main daal diya
 In the meantime, Tralang Swami appeared on the roof of the jail
 jis kothri main police ne trailang swami ko band kar taala laga diya tha, us kothri kaa taala jyon kaa tyon tha or trailang swami jail kii chat par kaise aa gayi yah aashcharya kaa vishay tha
 Desperate, the police officers again locked him in the prison cell and locked the police guard in front of the cell, but this time also the great yogi was seen walking on the roof soon
 trailang swami sadaa maun dhaaran kiye rahete the
 If the devotees brought any beverage after being unharmed, they would break their fast by doing it
 ek baar ek naastik ne ek baaltee chuunaa gholkar swami ji ke saamne rakh diya or use gadha dahi bataaya
 Swamiji drank it, but shortly after, the agnostic began to suffer and began to beg Swamiji to protect his life
 trailang swami ne apana maun bhang karte hue kaha ki tumne mujhe vish pine ke liye diya, tab tumne nahin janaa ki tumhaara jivan mere jivan ke saath ekaakaar he
 If i did not know that God is sitting in my stomach in the same way that He is in the atom of the world, then the solution of lime would have killed me
 ab to tumne karm kaa devi arth samaj liya he, at: phir kabhi kisi ke saath chaalaaki karne kii koshish mat karnaa
 With these words of Tralang Swami, that atheist became pain free

 The initial days were very painful

 pratham mahayuddh aarambh hone ke samay ve germany main the or ladaai chhidane ke keval ek din pehle kisi tarah seemaa paar kar surakshit sthaan par pahunchane main safal hue
 In fact, most of the credit for his son Birbal Sahni's tendency for scientific curiosity and character formation is due to his initiative and inspiration, encouragement and perseverance, hard work and honesty
 inaki pushti is baat se hoti he ki professor birbal saahani apane anusandhan kaary main kabhi haar nahin maanate the, balki kathin se kathin samasya kaa samaadhaan dhundhane ke liye sadaiv tatpar rahete the
 Thus, life should be considered as a great challenge, which became the motto of his family

 varsay kii sandhi pratham vishwa yudgh ke ant main germany or gathbandhan deshon ke bich main hui thi
 After the First World War, the defeated Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919
 isaki vajah se germany ko apni bhoomi ke ek bade hisse se haath dhonaa padaa, duusare rajyon par kabja karne kii paabandi laga di gayi, unki sena kaa aakaar simit kar diya gaya or baari kshatipurti thope di gayi
 The Treaty of Versailles was forced on Germany
 is kaaran adolf hitler or anya german log ise apmanjanak maanate the or is tarah se yah sandhi dwitiya vishwayuddh ke kaarnon main se ek thi
 The Paris Peace Conference drafted and signed several treaties and agreements, but in all these treaties the Treaty of Versailles with Germany is important in many respects and prominent in all treaties
 chaar maheene ke parishram ke baad sandhi kaa masavida taiyaar hua
 The treaty, written in 230 pages, was divided into 15 parts and contained 440 sections
 6 may, 1919 ko yah sammelan ke sammukh pesh hui or sweekrut ho gayi
 On 30 April, the German delegation led by Foreign Minister Count Fon Brockdouf Rantaju reached Versailles
 pratinidhiyon ko trayanan pales hotel main tehraaya gaya
 The officers of the Allies were looking after their security
 hotel ko kantedaar taron se gher diya gaya tha or german pratinidhiyon ko manaahi kar di gayi thi ki ve mitrarashtron ke kisi pratinidhi yaa kisi patrkaar se kisi prakaar kaa sampark rakhen
 On 7 May, the Climes presented a treaty to the German delegation in front of other delegations, in front of the German delegation
 is masavide par vichaar-vimarsh karne ke liye unhen keval do saptaah kaa samay diya gaya
 Germany had to sign the treaty anyway
 german raajnneetigyon ne gambhirtha ke saath sandhi ke masavide par vichaar kiya or 26 dinon ke baad apni taraf se saath hajaar shabdon kaa ek virdohi prastaav prastut kiya
 Germany complained that the terms on which it had surrendered violated those principles in the proposed treaty
 unka kahana tha ki germany kii nayi sarkaar purna rup se prajatantric he or rashtrasang kii sadsyta ke liye icchhuk he
 The condition of disarmament should be applied not only to Germany but to all states
 vishwayuddh ke liye ekmaatr germany ko jimmedaar tehraana galat he
 The German proposal also stated that it is impossible to assume all the terms of the treaty
 ek bade raashtra ko kuchalakar tathaa use gulam banaakar sthaayee shanti sthapit nahin kii ja sakati
 The Allies considered the proposals of Germany and after some minor changes Germany was asked to sign the revised treaty within five days
 is baar germany ko yah avasar nahin diya gaya ki vah sandhi ke masavide ke sambandh main kisi prakaar kaa sanshodhan yaa nivedan prastut kar sake
 The Allies had made it clear that not signing would mean a re-invasion of Germany
 ant main german sarkaar ne sandhi par hastakshar karnaa sweekaar kar liye
 The formation and organization of the League of Nations was an extremely important part of the Treaty of Versailles
 sandhi ke pratham bhaag kaa sambandh isi se he
 It was originally President Wilson's creation
 uskaa khyaal tha ki rashtrasang ko shanti-sammelan kii sabase mahaan kriti honi chahie
 Lloyd George wrote that Wilson used to give the most importance to only the part of the peace treaties which had the League of Nations
 iske liye vah koi bhi tyaag karne ke liye taiyaar tha or ant main uske kathin prayaas se hi rashtrasang kaa nirmaan hua
 Barring Wilson, other representatives of the Allied view were of the view that it was not necessary to put the matters of the League under the Treaty of Versailles
 antatah wilson kii baat maan lee gayi or rashtrasang ke samvidhan ko varsay-sandhi ke antargat hi rakh diya gaya
 The first 26 sections of the Treaty of Versailles are the constitution of the League of Nations, whose purpose was to increase international cooperation and to maintain international peace and security
 alss-lauren pradesh : varsay-sandhi dwaara pradeshik parivartan karke germany kaa ang-bhang kar diya gaya
 In 1871, Germany seized the territory of elsse-laurent from France
 sabon ne ek swar se is baat ko sweekaar kiya ki yah ek galat kaam hua tha or iskaa ant aavashyak he
 Hence, the terms of the treaty were given back to the territories of alsace-lorraine to France
 rinland : france kii suraksha kii drushti se germany ke rinland main mitra rashtron kii sena 15 varshon tak rahegi tathaa rin nadi ke aas-paas ke kshetra ko sthai rup se nihshastr kar diya jaae taaki germany kisi prakaar kii kilabandi na kar sake
 Saar region: Saar region was famous for the coal field in Germany
 is pradesh kii shashan vyavastha kii jimmevary rashtrasang ko saunp di gai kintu koyale kii khaanon kaa swaamitv france ko diya gaya
 It was also decided that after 15 years a referendum would decide whether the people of the Saar region would stay with Germany or with France
 yadi saravasi germany ke saath milane kii ichha prakat karen to germany france ko nishchit mulya dekar khaanon ko punah kharid le
 Receipt of Belgium and Denmark: The territories of Uppen Marshnet and Malamedi were reduced to Belgium
 shleshwig main janamat sangrah karke uskaa uttari bhaag denmark ko de diya gaya
 Germany's eastern border: Germany suffered the most on the eastern border
 mitra rashtron ne swatantra poland rajya ke nirmaan kaa nirnay kiya
 Danzing was converted into an independent city and kept under the protection of the League of Nations
 poland ko samudri maarg dene ke liye dajing ke bandargah kaa upyog karne kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 The port of Memel was transferred from Germany to Lithuania
 germany ne checkoslovakia ke rajya ko manyata di
 Thus under the territorial system, Germany had to lose 25 thousand square miles of territory and a population of 70 lakhs
 german upnivesh sambandhi vyavastha : mitra raashtra german upniveshon ko apane-apane samrajya main milanaa chaahate the kintu wilson ne iskaa kadaa virodh kiya
 Allies introduced the patronage system due to Wilson's opposition
 iskaa aashay yah tha ki jo desh bahut pichde hue he unka samuchit kalyaan va vikaas karnaa
 The form of holy heritage in civilized nations should be given by the League of Nations for its advancement
 Mindet vyavastha ke tahat germany ko apni sabhi upnivesh chhodane pade or unhen mitra-rashtron ke sangrakshan main rakhaa gaya
 Many islands in the Pacific Ocean and colonies in the African continents were lost to Germany
 german sena kii adhiktam sankhya ek lakh kar di gai
 Compulsory military service was banned
 hawaii jahaajon ko pratibandhit kar diya gaya
 In addition, naval power was also limited
 germany kii nausena ke keval 6 yudhpot rakhane kii ijaajat di gai
 There was talk of handing the submarines to the Allies
 nihshastreekaran kii is vyavastha kaa paalan karwaane tathaa nigaraanee rakhane ke liye germany ke kharch par mitra rashtron kaa ek sainik ayog sthapit kiya gaya
 Thus, Germany was crippled in military terms
 varsay sandhi kii 231veen dhara ke tahat germany va uske sahyogi rajyon ko yuddh ke liye ek maatr jimmedaar mana gaya
 Therefore, for the compensation that the Allies had to bear in the war, Germany was asked to compensate the Allies by 1921
 mitra rashtron ko germany se kuch vastu ke aayaat-niryaat par vishesh suvidhaayen di gai
 The Nile Canal was internationalized and left open to all ships
 sandhi kii 231veen dhara ke anusaar sari kshati or yuddh ke liye germany ko uttaradaayi tehraaya gaya
 The establishment of the League of Nations under the political system was an important part of the Treaty of Warsaw
 wilson ke prabhaav ke kaaran hi rashtrasang kii dhaaraon ko varsay kii sandhi main rakhaa gaya
 The purpose of the League of Nations was to establish international cooperation and security
 vishwa itihaas main hui anek sandhiyon main varsay kii sandhi sarvaadhik varnit or vivaadit rahi he
 In fact, this treaty deeply influenced the course of world history
 in sandhi kii teevr aalochana kii jaati he or is dwitiya vishwayuddh ke beej ke rup main samajha jaataa he
 Criticism of this treaty can be seen under the following points- 1
 aropit sandhi : varsay kii sandhi ko “ek laadi gai shanti” kii sangya arthath “aropit sandhi” ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Germany was not accommodated in the conference when drafting the treaty
 yah mitra rashtron kaa aadesh tha jise sweekaar karne ke atirikt germany ke samaksh koi doosraa upaay nahin tha
 They were also threatened by the German representatives, if they did not sign the treaty within five days, they would be attacked again
 atah germany ke man main yah baat baith gai ki yah aropit sandhi he jise maanane ke liye vah baadhya nahin he
 This is the reason why Germany later rejected the treaty provisions
 2
 jansadharan kii shanti nahin, rajanyikon kii shaanti : varsay kii sandhi main ullekith praavdhaan jansadharan ke hit or aakankshaon ko puraa nahin kar sake
 There were many regional arrangements that needed to be amended
 kshatipurti main kai aise praavdhaan kiye gaye the jo europe ke audyogic punerjeevan ko vinaashkari aghat pahuchaaye bina vasuul nahin kiye ja sakate the
 In this way, this treaty of peace of the public does not complete
 3
 kathor evam apmanjanak sharten : varsay kii sandhi dwaara germany ko chhin-bhinn kar diya gaya, upnivesh chin aarthik rup se pangu bana diya gaya, aarthik sansadhano par duusare rashtron kaa swaamitv sthapit kar diya gaya or sainik drushti se use aapng bana diya gaya
 The condition of compensation was very harsh and humiliating
 kshatipurti kii rakam adaa na karne kii sthiti main germany ke kshetron par kabja karne kii baat kii gai
 In fact, the conquering nation imposed harsh conditions on Germany under retaliation
 sandhi kii sharte itani kathor thi ki koi bhi swabhimani, susanskrit raashtra ise sahan nahin kar saktaa tha
 In Churchill's words, "its economic conditions were stigmatized and ill-informed to the extent that they made it manifestly meaningless
" ” 4
 The treaty was harsh in the wrong places and unfairly soft: The treaty was not only unusually harsh, but it was harsh in the wrong places and unfairly soft
 tathakthith yuddh aparaadh sambandhi praavdhaanon germany dwaara sweekrut karaane kaa praytn yatharth se pare tha kyonki jaisaa david thamsan ne kaha “is baat kaa ullekh aise masaude main shaamil karke jis par hastakshar karne ke liye german pratinidhi vivash kiye gaye naiki uttardaayitv kii bhaavana utpann nahin kar sakate the
 “the second compensation was also demanded in improbable amounts and its huge amount was fixed without any serious consideration
 aarthik drushti se yah sampada germany ke liye chukaana tathaa mitra rashtron ke liye praapt karnaa kaise sambhav hoga, iskaa vishleshan nahin kiya gaya tha
 Undoubtedly, the entire size of the punishment and compensation was inconsiderate and impractical
 uparyukt sabhi prakaar kii anaavashyak kathorataayen germany ke rashtriya asantosh va krodh ko abhivyakti karne kii uski kshamta ke viruddh koi pruthak kadam nahin uthaaya gaya
 This treaty was unfairly soft, it was hardly appropriate to rule the 'essence region' by the League of Nations for 15 years and return it to Germany in 1935
 rinland par 15 varsh tak mitra rashtron kaa adhikaar bhi khokhla siddh hua
 5
 Retaliatory Treaty: The conquering nations imposed harsh terms on Germany by adopting a vengeful attitude
 france apni puraani paraajay or ampan kaa badla lenaa chaah rahaa tha us drushti se sandhi main germany ke saath adhiktam kathor praavdhaan kiye gaye
 6
 Abusive Treaty: This treaty was a cause of national humiliation for Germany
 kaisar wiliam kii apadasta, baari kshati purti raashi kii vasuuli
 Allied states' authority on German shores, Karkhono, rivers, etc
, and the presence of armies in Germany, the division of Germany, the plunder of the colonies by friendly countries and discriminatory, unequal, unjust conditions, etc
 were all derogatory
 sandhi patron par hastakshar ke liye aane vaale german pratinidhiyon ke saath klemensho kaa abhadra vyavhar, unhen kaidiyon ke saamaan rakhana, janata dwaara gaaliyaan, sade hue fal, inte,pathar ko un par phekna adi pratinidhiyon kaa apmaan nahin balki germany kaa apmaan tha
 7
 Treacherous Treaty: The Treaty of Warsaw was considered morally unfair and treacherous to Germany
 germany ne wilson ke 14 sutron ke aadhaar par yuddh kar sandhi karnaa sweekaar kiya tha lekin varsay kii sandhi main wilson ke in sutron kaa khuleam ulanghan hua tha
 The principle of nationalism was not followed with Germany
 us par bahut si sharte lad di gai thi
 But the winners are exempt from that
 wilson ke tisare sutara ke anusaar anterrashtriya vyapaar kii samast rukawate dur karne kaa praytn karnaa tha, kintu germany kii samuhik swtantraa surakshit nahin thi
 His international trade remained under the control of the Allies for years
 14 sutron main sabhi rashtron ke shastron ke kami karne kaa suzav diya gaya tha, kintu mitra rashtron ne apane shastron main kami kiye bina germany kii sainik shakti ko atyant simit kar diya
 The Allies followed Wilson's 14 sources to the same extent as he benefited
 is tarah varsay kii sandhi main germany ke saath vishwasghaat kiya gaya
 To further avenge this betrayal, Germany went to war
 8
 sandhi ke pranetaon main vaicharik sangharsh : varsay kii sandhi ne teen bado ke vichaara or uddeshyon main sangharsh kii sthiti maujuud thi
 There was opposition between Wilson's high but impractical view, Clemenceau's nationalist and realist demands, and Lloyd George's opportunistic motives, despite their agreement on the Warsaw Pact that reflected their imperialist and exploitative mentality
 logsan ke anusaar “wilson ke adarshavaad or sammelan ke bhautikwaad main teevr virodh tha or zyaadaatar maamalon main bhautikwaad vijayi rahaa
 " 9
 sanghash ke naye daur kii shuruuaat : varsay kii sandhi ne europea rashtron ke bich vishwavyapa satta ke liye nae sangharsh kii shuruuaat kii
 Until 1919, international law believed in the distinction between the property of a country's government and its citizens
 kintu varsay kii sandhi ke anusaar yuddhrat desh apane tathaa apane mitra rashtron kii seemaa main kisi shatru desh ke vyakti kii kisi prakaar kii sampati jabt kar saktaa tha
 If he was victorious in the war, he could force the government of the defeated country to compensate for its citizens' confiscated property
 yah ek nayaa drushtaant tha
 10
 Hatred towards the Weimar Republic: After the war, the Weimar Republic was established in Germany and was seen to be associated with the Treaty of Warsaw
 tamaam udaaravaadi visheshtaon ke bich ise shatru paksh dwaara sthapit sanstha mana gaya
 Therefore, in Germany, democracy became a system of dualism, hateful and hostile
 11
 aatmanirnay ke siddhant kii avhelnaa : italy kii simaaen rashtrawaad ke siddhant par nirdhaarit nahin kii gai, na hi poland kii bhoomi par sabhi naagarik nirvivaadit rup se pole the
 Similarly, parts of the Turkish Empire were not promised sovereignty
 rashtrasang vishaal va laghu rajyon ke samaan raajnneetik samprabhutaa dilaane main asamarth rahaa
 Regarding the moral aspect and tactical compatibility of this treaty, AJP Taylor states that "from the beginning the Treaty of Warsaw lacked moral recognition
" germany ke vishay main aatm nirnay ke siddhant kii avhelnaa kii gai
 Many nations of Europe were reorganized according to President Wilson's principle of self-determination
 isse anusaar ek hi raashtra jati, ek hi bhashaa evam saanskrithik parampara vaale logon ko milakar unka pruthak tantra banane kaa nishchay kiya gaya
 On this basis, independent states of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia were born
 kintu is siddhant kaa germany, austria or hungary ke sambandh main paalan nahin kiya gaya
 Thousands of German citizens were separated from the German Empire and subjugated to other states
 ” 1918 i
 main jab austria ke germanon ne german-austria ganatantr kii sthapana kii or german ke ganatantr ke saath sammilit hone va land ko milaane kii ichha vyakt kii tab mitra rajyon dwaara sitambar 1919 i
 main donon rajyon ke sammilan par pratibandh laga diya gaya
 Thus the German citizens were disappointed by not implementing the principle accepted by the Allies about Germany
 butlerane anusaar “aatmanirnay ke siddhant kaa yuktiyukt prayog na karnaa paris kii vyavastha main antarnihit kamajori kaa dyotak tha
 " vishwa itihaas ke jin ek sandhiyon or uske prabhaavon kii sarvaadhik charchaa hui he, unamem varsay kii sandhi kaa vishisht sthaan he
 Critics have defined it as the cause of World War II in terms of the harsh provisions of that treaty and its form
 unke anusaar varsay kii sandhi shanti kii vyavastha na hokar asantosh kii janak thi
 Just after 20 years, 2 months and 4 days after the treaty, this world was hit by the Second World War
 sandhi hone ke baad se hi uski vyavasthaaon ko germany dwaara bhang kiya jaataa rahaa
 At the same time amendments were also made to the treaty provisions
 in sandhi praavdhaanon ke ulalanghanon evam sanshodhano ne sansar ko dwitiya vishwa yuddh kii ore dhakel diya
 The treaty provisions were violated and amended because it was too harsh and abusive
 aisi kathor evam apmanjanak sandhi kii sharton ko koi bhi swabhimani raashtra ek lambey samay tak bardaasht nahin kar saktaa tha
 Therefore, it was clear that Germany would try to get rid of the system imposed by the Versailles Treaty and wash away the stigma of humiliation as soon as the above opportunities are given in future
 germany kii catholic centre party ke agerburger kaa viraam sandhi ke samay vaktavy tha ki "german jati ksht sahegi parantu maregi nahin
 "naturally, Germany made a successful attempt to wash away these derogatory terms
 parinamswaroop kuch hi varshon main europe kaa raajnneetik vaataavaran atyant ashaant ho gaya or vishwa ko pratham mahayuddh se bhi adhik bhayankar or pralayankari yuddh dekhnaa padaa
 Even according to France's Marshal Fouche "this treaty is not peace, only a 20-year ceasefire
" " spasht he ki isi sandhi main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke beej vidyaman the
 At the time of the treaty in 1919, Germany was helpless and had no choice but to quietly accept the treaty but as time passed, it began to breach the terms of the treaty by accumulating some power and the treaty makers also Made amendments
 1926 main jab germany ko rashtrasang kii sadsyta di gai tab sandhi ke pratham bhaag main sanshodhan kiya gaya
 The seventh part of the war criminals was never fully implemented
 german samraat wiliam kaisar sahit anek yuddh aparaadhiyon ko dand na dekar mahaj kuch ek ko saamaanya dand die gaye
 The provision relating to compensation was first amended and later abandoned altogether
 lojaan sammelan main kshatipurti ke prashn ko hi samaapt kar diya gaya
 After Hitler's rise to German politics in 1933–34, breaking the terms of Warsaw became a minor thing
 1935-36 main hitler ne sandhi ke nihshastreekaran se sambandhit praavdhaanon kaa ulanghan kar senaaon main vruddhi kii or 1936 main rinland par adhikaar kar liya
 In March 1938, Hitler dissolved the provisions of the territorial arrangements of the Treaty of Warsaw by combining Austria with Germany and September 1938 in Czechoslovakia
 jab hitler ne varsay sandhi dwaara nirmit poland se sambandhit polish galiyare evam danging bandargah sambandhi vyavasthaaon ko todane ke uddeshy se poland par akraman kiya to dwitiya vishwayuddh prarambh ho gaya
 To break the unjust arrangements of the Versailles Treaty, Hitler started a series of events that led to the outbreak of the Second World War
 is tarah varsay kii sandhi praavdhaanon ke unmoolan kii prakriya kii antim parinti dwitiya vishwayuddh ke aarambh main hui
 From this point of view, the seeds of World War II can be seen in the Treaty of Versailles
 kuch aalochak maanate hai ki varsay sandhi kii kathor sharte nahin balki unako kriyanvit karne kii dhilaai dwitiya vishwayuddh kaa kaaran bani
 According to logsm is prakaar isamen koi andeh nahin ki varsay kii anyaaypurna kathor or apmanjanak sandhi, ek seemaa tak dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke liye uttaradaayi thi
 But it is also true that the conflicting policy of the Allies, neglect, indifference, appeasement and the policy of not strictly enforcing the terms of the treaty were also no less responsible for it
 charna khaane kii ek vidhi hoti he jisamen koi shaakaahaari jeev ghaas, shaiwal yaa anya vanaspatiyon ko khaataa he
 In agriculture, domestication of domesticated animals is converted chemically into milk, meat and other animal products

 aapekshikta siddhant sankshep main yah he ki 'nirpeksh' gati tathaa 'nirpeksh' twaran kaa astitv asambhav he, arthath 'nirpeksh gati' evam 'nirpeksh twaran' shabd vastut: nirarthak hai
 If 'absolute motion' had meaning, then it could be certain without referring to other bodies
 parantu sab prakaar se cheshtaa karne par bhi kisi pind kii 'nirpeksh' gati kaa pataa nishchit rup se prayog dwaara pramanit nahin ho sakaa he or ab to aapekshikta siddhant bataata he ki aisa nishchit karnaa asambhav he
 a new approach in physics started with relativity theory
 aapekshikta siddhant ke aane se bhautikee ke katipay puraane siddhanton kaa drudh sthaan dig gaya or anek moulik kalpanaaon ke vishay main sookshm vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa dikhaai dene lagi
 In science, the function of theory is often to systematically formulate known fruits and then to test new fruits from that theory by experiment
 aapekshikta siddhant in donon kaaryon main safal rahaa he
 By the end of the 19th century, physics was developing according to Newton-inspired theories
 prayek nae avishkaar athwa praayogic fal ko in siddhanton ke drushtikon se dekha jaataa tha or aavashyak nai pariklpanaayen banaai jaati thim
 Among them was the ubiquitous ether
 ether ke astitv kii kalpana karne ke do pramukh kaaran the
 Firstly, a medium like ether was required for the vibration of electromagnetic waves to propagate from one place to another
 dwitiya, yantriki main newton ke gati vishyak samikarnon ke liye, or jis parshwabhoomi par ye sameekaran aadhaarit the uske liye bhi, ek pramanik nirdeshak kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Specific properties were applied to the ether to accurately assess the fruits of the experiments
 ether sarvyaapee samajha jaataa tha or sampurna dishaao main tathaa pindon main bhi uskaa astitv mana jaataa tha
 In this stable ether, objects could travel without resistance, it was imagined
 in gunon ke kaaran ether ko nirpeksh maanak samajhane main koi baadha nahin thi
 Light speed 3x108 m
 Per second, it was known and waves of light are radiated at this speed relative to 'stationary' ether, it was imagined
 yantriki main veg, twaran, bal ityadi ke liye bhi ether nirpeksh maanak samajha jaataa tha
 In the second half of the 19th century, many attempts were made to experiment with the existence of ether and to establish its properties
 inamen micelsonmorle kaa prayog vishesh mahatvapurn tathaa ullekhneey he
 The purpose of this experiment was to make an accurate measurement of the speed at which the Earth revolves around the Sun with the ether
 kintu yah praytn asafal rahaa or prayog ke fal se yah anumaan nikaala gaya ki ether ke saapeksh prithvi kii gati shunya he
 It also means that the imagery of ether is untrue, that is, ether does not exist
 yadi ether hi nahin he to nirpeksh maanak kaa bhi astitv nahin ho saktaa
 Thus, the motion can only be relative
 bhautikee main saamanyat: gati kaa maapan karne ke liye athwa fal vyakt karne ke liye kisi bhi ek paddati kaa nirdesh dekar kaary kiya jaataa he
 But in these instructional methods, no method can be 'specific', because if it were, then we could consider that 'specific' instructional method as the standard of relaxation
 anek prayogon se aisa hi fal praapt hua
 The fruits of these experiments created serious disturbance not only in physics, but also in science and philosophy
 20veen shatabdi ke prarambh main prasiddh french ganitagya ech
 poincare ne aapekshikta kaa pranium prastut kiya
 According to them the laws of physics should be expressed in such a form that they are real to any observer
 iskaa arth yah he ki bhautikee ke niyam prekshak kii gati ke upar avlambit na rahen
 This act sheds new light on the prevailing conceptions of pain and time
 is vishay main oinstin kii vichaardhaara, yadhyapi vah krantikaarak thi, prayogon ke falon ko samajhane main adhik safal rahi
 Einstein made special analysis of the fundamental words and the prevailing conceptions combined with them, such as speed, acceleration, acceleration, time, etc
 is vishleshan se yah spasht hua ki newton ke siddhanton par aadhaarit tathaa pratishthit bhautikee main trutiyaan hai
 Einstein's theory of relativity is two categories: vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is swaroop main vyakt hote hai ki ve kisi bhi atwarit prekshak ke liye samaan honge
 In the general relativity theory, the laws of physics are expressed in such a way that they will be independent or unrestrained by the motion of the observer
 vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1905 main hua or saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1915 main hua
 It was presented by Einstein in 1905 in one of his papers on the electrodynamics of moving bodies
 vishisht saapekshata do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he jo shastreey yantriki ke sankalpanaaon ke viruddh hai: The results from the theory of specific relativity are surprising; Some of these are as follows: shastreey yantriki main galileo kaa roopaantaran prayukt hota he jabaki vishisht saapekshata main lorents roopantaran 
 The theory of relativity developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1911 is known as 'general Relativity'
 yah siddhanth nimnlikhit do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he- Specific relativity theory improved the assumptions made in physics about length, distance, time, mass, energy, etc
 inke atirikt bhautikee ke kshetra main anya vishay hai jo utane hi mahatvapurn hai, kintu unka samavesh vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main nahin he
 The specific relativity principle can be used in force and electromagnetic fields, as it cannot in the gravitational field
 gurutvkarshan bhautikee kaa ek atyant mahatvapurn vibhaag he, at: spasht he ki vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ko vyapak banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The relation of mass comes in two ways in physics
 kisi pind par jab bal kaary karata he tab pind kaa sthaan badalata he or uskaa veg badalata he
 The body gets acceleration as long as the force acts
 yantriki ke niyamon ke anusaar bal, pind kaa dravyaman or twaran main nimnlikhit sambandh he : The mass m in this equation is called inertia or dependent mass
 dravyaman kaa doosraa sambandh newton ke guruttviya kshetra main aata he
 According to Newton's theory of gravity, if two masses, m1 and m2, are at a distance r, the following gravitational force f will work between them: is sameekaran main g gurutvkarshan sthiraank he
 If we consider m1 as the mass of the earth and m2 as the mass of another body near the earth, the equation will express the mass m2
 newton kii yantriki main gativigyaan tathaa gurutvkarshan swatantra or bhinn hai, kintu donon main hi dravyaman kaa sambandh aata he
 Einstein integrated the concepts used in these two independent and different divisions of the mass into his general relativity theory
 yah gyaat tha ki jadtv par ashrith dravyaman or gurutveey dravyaman samaan hote hai
 Einstein used this analogy of mass to harmonize kinetics and gravity, and in 1915 AD introduced a comprehensive relativity theory
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant ko ganit main sutrit karne kii jo paddati he vah anya paddatiyon se bhinn he
 It uses special geometry, which is different from Euclid's three-dimensional geometry
 ] ne yah bataaya ki yadi vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main dik ke teen aayam tathaa samay kaa chaturth aayam, in chaaron ayaamon ko lekar ek 'chaturaayam satati', kii kalpana kii jaae to aapekshikta siddhant adhik saral ho jaataa he
 Symmetry is not absolute - it has been proved
 isse newton pranit dik tathaa samay kii nirpekshata or swatantraaa samaapt ho jaati he
 Therefore, to express physical phenomena, the quadrant of time and time is more natural
 riman ne 'chaturaayam dik' kii kalpana karke uski jyamiti kaa jo vikaas kiya tha uskaa oinstin ne adhik upyog kiya
 In this quadrant of time and time, the principles of physics were geometrically placed in the general relativity theory
 is chaturaayam satati kaa yuclid ke teen aayam ke dik se samya he
 In the reality of three dimensions, just as a point or a place is determined by these three coordinates, the length between two points and one is also fixed
 chaturaayam satati main dik ke in teen ayaamon ke saath jab samay bhi joda jaataa he tab samay kaa aayam rup t = x0
5c-1 aata he, jahaan t = samay or c = prakaash kaa veg he
 If one observer specifies a world event, then the speed relative to that observer will be the coordinates of the same event for another observer
 lorenz ke roopantaran ke niyam yadi yatharth hon to siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki By developing the equation, similar but highly complex terms are found for any type of motion
 iske liye nishchalon or pradishon ke siddhanton kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Gravity naturally occurs in the wider relativity theory by expanding the original imaginations in this way
 uske liye vishisht pariklpanaaon kii aavashyaktaa nahin haati he
 The results of many events are the same, according to Einstein's pervasive relativity theory and Newton's pioneering mechanics
 kintu khagoliki main jab saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa upyog kiya gaya tab teen ghatnaon ke fal pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar nikle falon se kuch bhinn rahe
 From these fruits one can take the test of general relativity theory
 ye teen fal is prakaar hai: According to Greek history "hector" was a Trojan general and prince
 vah troy ke yuddh ke sabase bahadur or mahaan yoddhaon main se ek tha
 It was the eldest son of Emperor Prime and Queen Hecuba
 isi kaaran itihaasakaron ke hisaab se yah pataa chalata he ki yah dardanas or tros ke vanshaj maane jate hai
 His wife's name was "andromake", with whom he also had a son named "scamandrius"
 troy ke mahayuddh main inhone trojan sena ke saath ladakar 31,000 unani sainik ko maaraa tha
 According to the Greek writer "homer" Hector was a loving, thoughtful, fearless, responsible son, husband and father who had no ulterior motives
 unani bhashaa main "hectares" kaa matlab 'apane paas hona' yaa 'pakadana' hota he
 According to another writer, the name is a name of "zeus", because he is "the one who keeps everything together"
 hectares ke bhai hellenus ko ek akashwani main yah pataa chalata he ki hectares kii mrityu ajaks ke haathon nahin likhi gai thi
 On the strength of this radio, Hector gathered both the armies and started to challenge any one Greek warrior to fight
 nau sainik aage aaye or usame se ajaks sabase balavaan tha
 Hector gave him his sword
 isi talwaar se hectares ne ajaks ko maar daalaa
