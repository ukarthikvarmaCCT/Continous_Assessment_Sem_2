us samay hindi main ucch shiksha dena ek asambhav baat samajhi jaati thi
 Gurukul showed this by turning it into action
 us samay aadhunik vidwaanon kii pustaken hindi main nahin thi
 The Gurukul students first worked in this field and many Gurukul texts were published
 pro maheshacharan singh kii 'hindi chemistry', pro saathe kaa 'vikaswad', shriyut govardhan kii 'bhautikee' or 'rasayan' pro ramshrandas saxena kaa 'gunatmak vishleshan', pro sinha kaa 'vanaspatishaastra' pro prannath kaa 'arthshaastra', 'rashtriya aay-vyay shaastra' or 'raajnneetishastra', pro baalkrishna kaa 'arthshaastra' or 'raajnneetishastra', or pro sudhakar kaa 'manovigyaan' hindi main apane-apane vishay ke pehle granth hai
 The creation of scientific texts in Hindi was started by Gurukul
 in vaigyanik granthon ke atirikt anya bhi bahut se ucchkoti ke granth gurukul dwaara prakashit hue
 Prof
 Ramdev did his basic research on Indian history and published his famous 'history of India'
 mahatma munshi raamji ne bhi vividh dharmon ke tulanaatmak adhyayan kar moulik granth likhe
 In 1918, the President of the University of Calcutta, Dr
 Sadler, Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee, visited Gurukul
 gurukul kaa avlokan karke ve bahut prabhavit hue
 He expressed his views regarding Gurukul in one of his letters - us yug ke ek prasiddh vidwaan shri nivas shastri ucch shiksha ke madhyam ke rup main angreji ke kÍ r samarthak the, par gurukul kaa kaary santoshprad paane par unhone kaha - 'meraa apana vichaar yah rahaa he ki vidhyalay vibhaag main shiksha kaa madhyam bhartiya bhashaayen hi rahani chahie, parantu mahavidhyalay vibhaag kii padhai angreji ke madhyam dwaara honi chahie
 But now seeing the Gurukul, i am moving away from this idea of mine
 maikale ke baad bharat main shiksha ke kshetra main jo sabase mahatvapurn or moulik praytn hua, vah gurukul he - remje macdnold The great curiosity of Gurukul Kangri was to make these ideas acceptable by his functional test
 pehle yah asambhav samajha jaataa tha ki hindi ucch shiksha evam vaigyanik vishyon ke adhyayan adhyaapan kaa madhyam ban sakati he
 Gurukul first made this idea possible in modern India through his trial
 yahan adhyapakon tathaa praadhyaapakon ne rasayan, bhautik vigyaan, vanaspati shaastra, manovigyaan, vikaswad aadi vishyon par hindi main pehali pustaken likhin
 The scientific writing of Hindi got a great boost from the fact that Gurukul Kangdi made Hindi a medium for education in all subjects including science and accordingly 17 books were also implemented

 At the same time, Veeram Dev of Merta adopted a policy of treachery

 It was written in them that Sardar Rao would imprison Maldev and hand it over to Sher Shah

 Tokamak is the name of a special method and plant designed to hold hot plasma in a certain volume
 sabase pehle iskaa vikaas san 1950 main rus ke vaigyanikon ne kiya tha
 Nowadays, many Tokamak are operational in India including Japan, Russia, France, UK, USA and Germany
 yah 'fusion riector' ke nirmaan ke liye jaruri he
 With its help, a ring shaped magnetic field is created
 bharat main aditya or esasti-1 naamak do tokam gandhinagar ke plasma anusandhan santhaan main karyrat hai
 In 1979, there is a Hindi-language film
 saathottaree hindi sahitya hindi sahitya ke itihaas ke antargat san 1960 i0 ke baad mukhyatah navlekhan yug se kaaphi had tak bhinnata kii pratiti karaane vaali aisi peedi ke dwaara rachit sahitya he jinamein vidroh evam araajaktaa kaa swar pradhan tha
 However, along with it, the parallel stream of spontaneity and democratic consciousness was also prevalent in the field of literature, which later became dominant
 saathottaree lekhan main vidrohi chetanayukta aandolan praathmik rup se kavita ke kshetra main mukhar hui
 Therefore, all the movements related to it were mainly poetry movements
 haalaanki kahani evam anya vidhaon par bhi iskaa asar paryaapt rup se padaa or kahani ke kshetra main bhi 'akahani' jaise aandolan ne rup dhaaran kiya
 Around sixty, the stream of new poetry began to look somewhat different from itself
 saath ke baad jo nayaa mode lakshith hota he vah ekaek deekhne vaali koi naveen vastu nahin, varan nayi kavita se hi phuta hua he
 The tone of discontent, disapproval and rebellion has emerged very clearly in the later sixties
 nayi kavita main bhi asantosh or asweekruti kaa swar vidyaman he, kintu saath ke baad is swar ne or tikhe vyangy or vidroh kaa rup dhaaran kar liya he, jivan kii tuutati murtiyon ke bahut kareeb jaakar unki tuutane kii talkhi, vyathaa or usamen se footati asweekruti kii ugrata ko pahachaanaa he
 The greatest feature of the new poem is that it conveyed authentic experiences of the whole life in their living environment
 vishay yaa anubhuti ke abhijatya or bhinn-bhinn drushtiyon yaa vaadon se bane hue unke gheron ko todakar vyakti dwaara bhoge jate hue jivan ke har chote-bade satya ko pratikon or bimbon ke madhyam se ubhaarne main hi usne kavita kii sarthakata samajhi
 But overall, despite the pain in the poets of the new poem, there remained a positive hope for future creation
 swatantryottar bharat kii tatkaaleen paristhitiyon ke kaaran unamem hataasha or tuutan kaa bhav kaaphi tha parantu sapane puure hone kii ek ksheen aashaa bhi bachi rahi thi
 Disillusionment or disillusionment did not occur as a whole, so the new poem has a sense of torture, a tone of disapproval, but not a revolt
 dhire-dhire 'ilugen' ek dam tut gayi, mohabhang ho gaya
 The social environment of the person started to look more ugly, dreams of the future were broken
 dow0 bachchan singh ke shabdon main kaviyon ke ugaae hue suraj main roshni nahin aayi-- surya kaa swaagat vyarth chalaa gaya
 Many litterateurs began to see only two ways that either they would express the intense feeling of pain by adding tone to the head of the new poem, or all these circumstances would make their sensitive mind emerge from the midst of torture and torture
 Everything started to inspire rejection
 sahitya main ye donon dharaayen raheen, parantu san saath ke turat baad vidrohi dhara pradhan rahi jinamein se adhikansh nirlakshya yaa yon-vikrutilakshi thim
 By being objective, these poems were conveniently revolting, that is, where there was a danger in rebellion, there was rebellion where there was convenience
 saathottaree hindi sahitya kaa pehla dashak aadhuniktawaad se vishesh prabhavit he
 It is important to note that there is a difference between modern and modernity
 'aadhunik' 'madhyakaalin' se alag hone kii soochna detaa he
 'modern' is the result of scientific inventions and industrialization while 'modernism' is the result of excesses of industrialization, metropolitan monotony, the catastrophe of two great wars
 dow0 bachchan singh ke anusaar "vastutah naveen gyaan-vigyaan, technology ke falswaroop utpann visham maanviya sthitiyon ke naye, gaiyr-romentic or amithkeey saakshaatkaar kaa naam 'aadhuniktaa' he
 " aadhuniktaavaadi sahitya ek vishesh prakaar kaa sahitya he
 It rejects established culture, values and sensibilities
 yah duniya kii manyataon ko manjuur nahin karti, parampara ko bedi ke rup main leti he
 The modernist undertakes interludes, mocking the values, he is a rebel
 bheed kaa virodh karata he, vah vyakti kii mukti kaa vishwasi he
 He finds himself in a non-human condition, and expels affection, gratitude etc
 sanyam kii kami, prayog, sahitya roopon kii tod-phod, shock dene kii manovriti, aakrosh-kshobh-hinsa kii aakanksha aadi isaki visheshtaayen yaa 'motiff' hai
 Among the many trends that have been active in the poetry field, experiencing the isolation from the new poem, the most notable is Ginsberg, Rajkamal Chaudhary emerging in Hindi parallel to American Beatnik and hungry poets like Malay Raychaudhuri and Subimal Basak of Bengal influenced by them
 Some other poets related to poetry and rejected poetry who wrote about 'hetero sexuality' and 'open secrecy'
 Specific assumptions made by adopting an attempt to your 'disfiliatt' society
 unki kavita main yon shabdaawalee kaa nanga prayog, apane vikshobh or aakrosh ko vyakt karne ke liye praayah ek sanskarahinta evam vikruti ke rup main miltaa he
 Rajkamal Chaudhary has been considered the leading poet of this decade
 raajakmal choudhary main aadhuniktaa apni samagrata main dikhaai padati he
 Chaudhary's imprint can be seen on most of the compositions of this time
 bitanic aandolan hindi main ek fishan kii tarah aayaa or kuch hi samay main nishprerak ho gaya kyonki uski jaden desh ke yatharth main nahin thim
 Actually he was a poet of anger
 apni aakroshpurna vaani main ye apana gussa utaarte rahe
 He continued to express his screams, wounds and sexual innuendo in poetry, rejecting all the previous values and traditions
 parantu, yuyutsavadi, nav pragatisheel yaa nav pragativaadee kaviyon ne saamaajik mulyon par bal dete hue in bitanicon se apni asahmati vyakt kii
 After the new poem, so many slogans were heard in a short period in the field of Hindi poetry, so many movements came that no other literature of the world had such a lot of slogans and movements in such a short period
 inamen se kuch andolan or naare to samay kii gard main hi dab gayi kintu kuch vikaas ke path par bade bhi
 In fact, the nutritious compositions of these movements were also similar to each other and sometimes the same poet followed many movements
 sahitya-rachana kaa yah samay andolanon kii arajak baadh kaa samay rahaa
 The names of these movements are mainly poem-oriented
 is dashak main baadh kii tarah aaye kavita-andolanon main vyavastha-virdohi andolanon ke saath-saath vyavastha-samarthak kai andolan bhi the; parantu praayah in sabhi andolanon main suvyavasthit chintan kaa abhaav tha, jiske kaaran praayah ye sabhi laghujivi siddh hue
 The general introduction of both these types of main movements is visible in the following headings
 march 1962 ke 'bharti' ke ank main srivirendrakumar jain ne 'sanathan suryodayi' nayi kavita kii ghoshnaa kii
 Expressing his intentions, he said that "we are wandering in the shadowless direction of fall-defeat, frustration, complacency and living suicides, in the face of the destitute poetic consciousness
 Carrying in, taking in nectar from death and taking away the leel of limitless in the border - the imperative Sanatan Suryodayi Nutan Kavita stream of tomorrow to come free We do
 " is prakaar is andolan kaa mukhya swar vyavastha kaa hi tha, parantu lagbhag 3 saal baad hi 'bharti' ke hi farvari 1965 i0 ke ank main 'sanathan suryodayi kavita' ke sthaan par 'nutan kavita' kaa swar sunai dene laga
 Former supporters of 'sanatan Suryodayi Kavita' like Gangaprasad Vimal joined themselves in the 'akavita' category
 yuyutsavadi kavita kaa sambandh 'yuyutsa' naamak patrika se rahaa he
 Shalabh Sriram Singh was the originator of the Yutaswadi poetry
 unki manyata rahi he ki aadim yuyutsa hi sahityasarjan kii mul prerana he
 He says that "I accept the same primitive youth as the original inspiration for literature, which has been at the core of every revolution, change or dissolution somewhere
 vah yuyutsa jijeevishaavaadi, mumurshavadi, vidrohatmak athwa platonic kuch bhi ho sakati he
 "in 'roopambra' of April 1965, under the 'commencement', this quote of Shalabh Sriram Singh was given by the Swadesh Indians while declaring 'yuyotsa is the only cause of all'"
 'roopambara' ke hi agast 1966 ke 'adhunathan kavita ank' main 'yuyutsavadi navlekhan pradhan sahakaari prayaas' ke rup main saamne aayaa, teen kaviyon ke vaktavy sahit
 The editor also raised the issue of new sensibilities
 vimal pandeya, rameshwaradutt maanav, om prabhakar, bajrang bishnoi aadi ne bhi apane aap ko is andolan se sambandhit kiya
 Vimal Pandey tried to associate 'yuyotsavada' with 'angry Young Man'
 shri om prabhakar ne 'yuddhechha' ko sanathan vritti maanate hue yuyutsa ko jijeevishaa kaa paryaay mana he
 Bajrang Bishnoi has linked the question of commitment to Yuyutsa
 'utkarsh' patrika ke july '66 ke ank main shriram shukla ne 'asweekrut kavita' kaa naaraa buland kiya or 'ek lambii asweekrut kavita' 'mari hui aurat ke saath sambhog' sheershak se prastut kii
 For Shukla ji, the experience of sexual intercourse is enough - to carry seven epics
 ' asweekrut kavita ke pravaktaa kavi kii manyata he-- "satya ko satya na kah paane kii vishmata kabhi na kabhi avrodh todakar bah nikalati he or tabhi janm hota he asweekrut kavita kaa
 "and" is a communicative poem of specific tendencies, emotions, situations, values, inconsistencies and moods, disproved in the present era, but also rejected
 " asweekrut kavita yon vikrutiyon kii kavita he
 The use of vulgar words is readily accepted for them and according to them they are anxious to 'change disliked arrangements'
 hal na prastut kar sake to bhi 'un par prashn chihn lagaakar besudh logon kaa dhyaan aakarshith karnaa' ye apana kartavya samajhate hai
 Dr
 Shyam Parmar, the narrator of 'akvita', has been considered, but Jagdish Chaturvedi was also an equal partner with him and was among the early proponents of 'akvita'
 vastutah 'akavita' patrika ke teen sampadak the-- jagadish chaturvedi, shyaam parmaar or rabindranath tyaagi
 Theoretical articles in support of Akvita were often not published in 'akvita' magazine
 un logon kii manyata thi kii 'baat bolegi ham nahin'
 However, Dr
 Shyam Parmar also wrote a book titled 'akvita and art-references' in support of Akvita, which attempted to define multiple verses
 jagadish chaturvedi is varg ke kaviyon ke dwaara bauddhik str par jeeye gayi jivan kii ekangita, visangati tathaa kachot ko sapraan abhivyakti pradaan karne kii sachetanta ke kaaran tathaa kavy kii puraatan parampara se pruthakta ke kaaran is kavy ko 'abhinav kavy' kii sangya dete hue kehete hai ki "unhen 'anti-kavy' ke saarth-vaahakon ke rup main pariganit kiya ja saktaa he
 "but Shyam Parmar does not consider Akvita as anti-poetry or anti-poetry
 ve akavita ko 'antarvirodhon kii anveshak kavita' maanate hai
 According to him, the specialty of this poetry movement is in the fact that "the tendencies of poets are associated with different mindsets"
 " "akavita kaldharmee kavita he
 It will be a limited-time poem, as it will not have to hoist flags in the future
 " tathaa "akavita main abhivyakti ke anek str sambhav hai
 In language and narrative, he is not committed, hence 'flexible'
 usamen jatil or 'tipsi' prakriyaayein hai-- sidhi or tuuti baaten hai
 "akavita's spokesperson Kavi also mentions that" new poetry or newcomers are not worthy of opposition to Akavita
 aandolan vritti ke log vyarth hi ise gut yaa shadyantr kii sangya dete hai
 " akavita ke andolan ko bhi bitanic aandolan ke saath jude hone kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 However, its proponents Jagdish Chaturvedi and Shyam Parmar described the behavior of the Beatnikis as blasphemous and absolutely denied their involvement with 'akvita'
 san 1965 se 67 tak nikalne vaali 'akavita' patrika ke prastaavkon main girijakumar maathur, prabhakar machave, bharat bhushan agarwal, vimal or atul aadi ke naam bhi saamne aaye the
 In this context, the works of Saumitra Mohan and Mudrarakshas are also notable
 america bitanic prabhaav ke kaaran dow0 prabhakar machave, bangla prabhaav ke kaaran raajakmal choudhary tathaa ginsvarg ke prabhaav ke kaaran trilochan or shamsher bahadur singh ne bhi beet kavita se apane aap ko sambhddha kiya tha
 In magazines called 'kriti' and 'expression', Machwe ji also declared his belief
 elahabaad se prakashit 'vidrohi peedi' ke kaviyon par bhi apratyaksh rup se yah prabhaav dikhaa
 Laxmikant Varma was the promoter of 'fresh poetry'
 verma ji pehle 'nayi kavita' ke bade samarthakon main se the
 He wrote the first important book related to the theoretical analysis of new poetry, 'paradigms of new poetry'
 parantu, baad main manyata badalane par ve 'taaji kavita' ke pravartak bane
 She started the movement of 'fresh poetry' because in the new poem, there was no longer any 'newness' and she had become distinguished in a particular way
 verma ji kaa yah bhi kahana tha ki "nayi kavita kaa adhikansh paroksh rup se nabhinal dwaara chhayavaad se jeevanshkti letaa rahaa tha
 "however, even this movement of 'fresh poetry' could not go on
 july 1965 tak main hi verma ji kaa saath nibhaane vaala koi ek kavi yaa lekhak bhi saamne nahin aayaa or "bina kisi shor-gul ke, 'taaji kavita' ke tajie apane aap dafn ho gayi
 " patibaddh kavita ke saath dow0 parmanand shrivastav kaa naam judaa hua he
 Dr
 Srivastava's belief is: "I believe that there is no other option in front of Kavita to interview the entire humanitarian of today and fight against the dehumanization induced by the capitalist system
 " tathaa "patibaddh kavita ke daayre main 'bhashaa' ek mahatvapurn astr he-- uparyukt sangharsh kaa
 "dr
 Srivastava has also further defined the nature of the struggle--" Conflict is a straightforward and meaningful word in committed poetry - it has no disguise - people who do not accept any kind of commitment create false conflict and Let's enjoy it
 is prakaar yah andolan aadhuniktawaad athwa araajaktaa se dur vyavastha kaa hi andolan tha or marxvad kaa hi ek rup tha
 There was an ideology, a political vision behind it
 sahaj kavita kaa sutaradhar dow0 rabindra bhramar ko mana gaya he
 This movement also had no connection with modernism or far-fetchedness
 iske samarthakon main acharya hajariprasad dvivedi, acharya nandadulaare vaajapeyi, agyeya, dinakar, dow0 nagendra, dow0 devraj, dow0 indranath madan, dow0 prabhakar machave or ramdarsh mishra ke naam shaamil the
 Dr
 Shyam Parmar and Rajkamal Chaudhary also supported it
 march 1967 main sahaj kavita kii vijyapti prakashit hui
 The excerpts of the communiquÃ© are as follows: "after the '60s, the craftsmanship of manorism in a class was considered to be the original goal and Hindi poetry emerged as a trade of crooked lines altogether
 isiilie vah fishan rahi he or bahut arthpurna bhi nahin xxrep 4 
 "so the goal of this poem is to" search for poetry from afresh "

 Dr
 Ravindra Bhramar defined Sahaja poetry in his article as follows - "the etymological meaning of the word 'sahaj' in the context presented will have to be 'saha jayate iti sahajah
 ' arthath jo rachana yatharth anubhuti samveg ke saath vaani ke moort madhyam main janm leti he, vah sahaj he
 From this point of view, authenticity of cognition is the primary object
 anubhuti pratyaksh tathaa pramanik hui to abhivyakti akrutrim or ajatil hogi
 "and" Sahaja's demand is social, despite being objective
 " dow0 bhramar ne patibaddhta ke prashn ko bhi sahaj kavita ke saath sambhddha karke dekha he : "apane yug ke jivan or sarjanaatmak daayitv se sahaj kavita puri tarah patibaddh he
 At its core lies the realization of simple life and a sincere effort to search for a medium of simple craft
 " The name of the new song appeared in a magazine called 'geetangini' published from Muzaffarpur in February 1958
 is patrika main kuch navagit bhi sankalit the
 Some authors consider the development of the new song to be parallel to the new poem and consider it to be a special genre of new poetry
 'navagit' kaa pratham samavet sankalan 'kavita' 1964 main om prabhakar ke sampadan main prakashit hua
 With this, Dr
 Ravindra Bhramar, Ramdarsha Mishra and Dr
 Ramesh Kuntal appeared as spokespersons of the Megh Navgita
 is sankalan main niraala se lekar nayi peedi tak ke anek geetkaaron ke geet sankalit the
 This movement of the new song was completely different from the other sixty-second momentary movements
 na to ise araajaktaa aadi se koi lenaa-dena tha or na hi waisi shaak aadi dene kii koi pravriti
 This genre has established itself
 kooling towers ooshmaa nishkasana ke ve upkaran hai jinka upyog sansaadhit apshisht ooshmaa ko vaataavaran main chhodane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Evaporation of water to remove processed heat in cooling towers is used either to cool the working liquid near the wet-bulb air temperature or to cool the working liquid near the dry-bulb air temperature
 For this one has to depend entirely on air
 saamaanya anuprayogon main tel shodhak kaarkaane, rasinic sanyantr, urja sanyantron or imaarat ko thanda karne main prayukt kiya jane vaala pravaahit hone vaale pani ko thanda karnaa shaamil he
 Towers can range from small roofs to very large oval structures with large roofs that are up to 200 meters in height and width up to 100 meters or similar to rectangular structures that can be up to 40 meters in height and up to 80 meters in length
 chote tower saamanytah factory main banate hai, jabaki bado kaa nirmaan site par hi kiya jaataa he
 They are usually associated with nuclear power plants
 andakaar kooling tower kaa patent fredrick vine itarasan or jerard cupurs dwaara 1918 main kiya gaya
 Cooling towers can generally be classified as HVAC or industrial duty according to Rentel, Roselito, and Stronghold, April stated in their book The Mystery of Towers Unfolded
 ek HVAC kooling tower chiller se ooshmaa chhodane vaali upashrenee he
 Water-cooled chillers typically have lower energy consumption than air-cooled chillers due to the release of heat in tower water at or near the temperature of the wet-bulb
 vaayu dwaara thande hone vaale chiller ko ooshmaa dry-balb ke taapmaana par chhodani chahie or is tarah se nunatam ausat ke pratipaksheeya-carnot vaali chakrakaar prabhaviktaa hoti he
 One or more cooling towers are used as air conditioning systems fitted in large office buildings, hospitals, and especially in schools
 aamtaur par, audyogic kooling towers HVAC towers kii tulana main adhik bade hote hai
 Cooling towers used in HVAC use cooling towers as well as water-cooled chillers or water-cooled condensers
 ek ton kaa air-condishning 12,000 beatiu / ghanta nikaalata he
 In fact, due to the heat-equivalent equivalent of energy on the surface of the cooling tower, the chiller compressor needs to be run to extract about 15,000 Btu / hr
 yah samatuly ton ko pani 10 Â°F ke kooling 3 amareeki galen / minute main ooshmaa nikaalane ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he, jo lagbhag 15000 beatiu / ghanta yaa 4
0 ke kshafishant of parformons he
 This COP energy efficiency ratio is equivalent to 13
65
 audyogic kooling towers kaa upyog vibhinn sroton jaise mashinari yaa garm prakriya vaali saamagree ke rup main ooshmaa nikaalane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Large industrial cooling towers are originally used to extract heat absorbed in circulating cold water at power plants, petroleum refineries, petrochemical plants, natural gas processing plants, food processing plants, semi-conductor plants and other industrial facilities
 koi vishisht 700 MW koyala aadhaarit bijli sanyantr main thande pani ko pravaahit karne kii dar kisi kooling tower kii lagbhag 71,600 cubic meter prati ghante hoti he or pravaahit hone vaale pani ke liye shaayad 5 pratishat ke hisaab se pani kii aapurti karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 If that plant does not have a cooling tower and uses continuously cooling water, it will require about 100,000 cubic meters per hour of water and this water volume has to be continuously transported to the ocean, lake or river where It came from, the plant will have to be supplied again
 Additionally, the warmth of a river or lake can increase its temperature due to the large amount of released warm water that may be unbearable to the level of the local ecosystem
 pani ke taapmaana badhane ke kaaran machhlee or anya jaleey jeev mar sakate hai
 Instead, the cooling tower releases heat into the environment and air and air diffusion expands heat over a larger area than hot water, causing the heat to be split into water sources
 tateey kshetron main sthapit kuch koyala aadhaarit or parmaanu aadhaarit urja sanyantron main mahaasaagar ke pani kaa satat upyog hota he
 However, to avoid environmental problems, offshore discharge water outlets need to be designed very carefully
 petroleum shodhashalaon main bhi bahut bade-bade kooling tower system hote hai
 a cooling tower in a typical large research complex containing 40,000 metric tons of crude oil per day requires about 80,000 cubic meters of water per hour
 vishwa kaa sabase adhik oonchai vaala kooling tower nideryusem power stesan he jisaki oonchai 200 meter he
 Processes used to release heat are mainly of three types: kisi wet kooling tower main, garm pani ko pariveshi vaayu vaale dry-balb ke taapmaana kii tulana main kam taapmaana par thanda kiya ja saktaa he, yadi vaayu apekshaakrit shushk he
 
 The ambient air evaporates when released with water
 vashpikaran santrupt air condishans ke parinamswaroop hota he, jiske kaaran pani kaa taapmaana wet balb ke vaayu ke taapmaana kii tulana main kam ho jaataa he, jo embeant dry balb vaayu taapmaana se kam hota he, iskaa nirdhaaran embeant vaayu kii ardata ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 To get better performance, the medium used to raise the surface between the flow of air and water is called fill
 spalash phil main vah saamagree hoti he jo spalash ke kaaran pani ke pravaah ko avaruddha karti he
 The film is made up of thin layers of fill material over which water flows
 donon vidhiyon se sataha ke kshetra main vruddhi hoti he
 There are three types of cooling towers in relation to pulling air through the tower: andakaar kooling tower sabhi prakritik kooling towers unki sanrachanaatmak majbooti or saamagree ke nunatam upyog ke kaaran maanak dizine bane gaye hai
 The spherical shape also aids in the acceleration of upward convective air flow to improve cooling efficiency
 ve khaastaur par parmaanu bijli sanyantron se sambhddha hote hai
 However, this relationship is incorrect because this type of cooling towers are also used in coal-fired power plants
 usee tarah se, sabhi parmaanu sanyantron main kooling towers nahin hote balki ve apane ushma pravaahakon ko jhil, nadi yaa mahaasaagar ke pani se thanda karte hai
 Crossflow is a design in which the air flow is in the vertical direction of the water flow
 Air flow enters the cooling tower through one or more vertical surfaces to fill the material
 pani gurutv dwaara phil se hokar bahata he
 The air continuously passes through the fill and thus water flows through the open body area
 kisi gahare tal vaale vitaran yaa garm pani ke basin jiske tal main chhed yaa nogel hote hai kaa upyog crossflo tower main kiya he
 The gravity-filled material spreads the water evenly through the nozzle
 ek counterflo dizine main vaayu pravaah pani kii bilkul vipareet disha main pravaahit hota he 
 pravaahit hone vaali vaayu sabase pehlefil media ke neeche khule kshetra main pravisht hoti he or tab lambavat rup main pravaahit kii jaati he
 Water is sprayed with a high pressure nozzle and flows downstream in the opposite direction of air flow through the fill
 donon dizine ke liye samaan: Both crossflow and countflow designs can be used in natural draft and mechanical draft cooling towers
 flu gas shodhan se las kuch aadhunik urja sanyantr jaise power stesan stadinger grasscrotenberg or power stesan rostok main kooling tower kaa upyog flu gas stack ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Flue gas untreated plants may have corrosion problems
 parinaam ke taur par, wet kooling tower ke chaaro ore saamagree santulan, vashpikaran kooling tower system ko pratipurti pravaah dar ke kaaryaatmak char, vashpikaran or vaayu gharshan ksharan, pravaah kii dar or sandrata chakra ko chalaaya jaataa he: In the above diagram, the water released from the lower basin cools the water in an industrial facility via the coolers and retainers process
 thanda pani ooshmaa ko garm prakriya vaali dhara se ooshmaa ko sokh letaa he jise thanda yaa sanghanit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or avashoshit ooshmaa pravaahit hone vaale pani ko garm kar detii he
 The hot water returns to the top of the cooling tower and drips downward onto the material filled in the tower
 jaise-jaise yah neeche kii taraf tapakataa he, to yah tower main bade-bade pankhons kaa upyog karke prakritik yaa forced draft dwaara tower se uthne vaali vaayu ke sampark main aata he
 Due to its contact some water dissolves as air friction and some water evaporates
 pani ke vashpikaran ke liye aavashyak ooshmaa ko pani se puraa kiya jaataa he jo pani ko waapas mul basin vaale pani ke samaan taapmaana par thanda karata he or pani phir se pun:parichaarit karne ke liye taiyaar ho jaataa he
 Due to the evaporation of water, the dissolved salts remain in the rest of the water which does not evaporate, thus increasing the salt concentration in the circulating cold water
 pani main lavan sandrata kii maatra ko badhane se rokthaam ke liye isamen pani ke kuch maatra chodi jaati he
 Accumulated fresh water is then supplied to the tower's basin to compensate for evaporated water
 sampurna system main shesh pani: Since there are no salts in evaporated water, the amount of chloride in the system will be approximately: or isliye: With a simple heat balance around the cooling tower: bade paimaane vaale audyogic kooling towers se gharshan kshatiyaan, vinirmaan data kii anupasthiti main is prakaar se maane ja sakate hai: The concentration cycle refers to the accumulation of dissolved minerals in re-circulating cold water
 in khanijon ke sanchay ko niyantrit karne ke liye saiddhanthik rup se nikaalane kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The chemical properties of accumulated water, such as the amount of dissolved minerals, can vary significantly
 ghule pani main sanchit pani jaise ve jinase pani kii aapurti dharatleey pani se kathor dhaatuon main kii jaati he
 The accumulated water of the ground which usually contains a high amount of minerals should be separated from them
 chakra dwaara pani ko pipon main bahane ke liye maujuud khanijon kii maatra ko badhaakar pani kii lavanta ko kam kiya ja saktaa he haalanki khanijon kii adhikta ke kaaran unhen alag karne kii samasya ho sakati he
 Since increasing the concentration cycle water, it is not possible to extract minerals dissolved in water
 jab in khanijon kii vilayata bad jaati he to ve unhen thos khanijon ke rup main baahar nikaal sakate hai or jinke kaaran kooling tower yaa ooshmaa excangers main ooshmaa pratisthapana main dooshan or ushma parivartan kii samasya utpann ho sakati he
