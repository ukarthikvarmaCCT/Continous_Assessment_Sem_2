 First, that Matsyendranath and Jalandharnath were contemporary; Secondly, Matsyendranath was the Guru of Gorakhnath and Jalandharnath was the Guru of Kanupa or Krishnapada; Thirdly, that Matsyendranath was once the originator of the yog-marg, then incidentally got involved in an ethos in which uninterrupted association with women was the main thing - possibly it was the Vamachari Sadhana; - fourth, that from the very beginning, the cultivation of Jalandhar Nath and Kanipa - The method was different from the practice of Matsyendranath and Gorakhnath

 The cortex level is composed exclusively of nerve cells, although it also contains formulas derived from cells and connective tissue called neuromlia, but at this stage the cells predominate
 swayan praantastha main kai str haate hai
 There are two types of formulas in the level of sutras: one which are interlinked different centers; There are those sessions that go out of the cells there and go down into the inner compartment and reach the degree of hawker collected in the pyramidal path there
 manushya tathaa ucch shrenee ke pashuon, jaise ap, garilla aadi main, praantastha main vishisht staron kaa bananaa vikaas kii unnat seemaa kaa dyotak he

 It is the work of this organ to reconcile them all, so that the actions of the organs continue evenly
 sharir ko thik banaae rakhana is ang kaa vishesh karm he
 The sources by which these impulses reach the end of the periphery reach the dentate nucleus located within the hemisphere from the cortex, which is a large mass of gray matter, ie cells
 vahaan se nae sutara madhyamastishk main duusari ore sthit laal cendrak main pahonchte hai
 From there, the momentum reaches the brain
 anumastishk ke saamne kaa upar kaa bhaag madhyamastik or neeche kaa bhaag merushirsh he
 The relation of cerebellum and cerebrum is established by the midbrain
 maghyamastishk main hote hue sutara pramastishk main usee ore, yaa madhyarekha ko paar karke duusari ore ko, chale jate hai
 In the middle of the midbrain is Silvius's axillary, which carries the cerebrum from the ventricle to the fourth ventricle
 iske upar kaa bhaag do samakon parikhaaon dwaara chaar utsedhon main vibhakt he, jo chatushtay kaay yaa pind kaha jaataa he
 In the upper two regions, the sutures reach the retina from the eye through the retina

 In the below examples, the sutras come from the calcular part of the inner ear and from them the new sutras bring the new sutras to the conch shell of the cerebrum
 merurajju se anya sutara bhi madhyamastishk main aate hai
 Coming here in the form of agony, cold, heat, etc
, gathering in many masses, crossing the same side by merushera, or crossing to the other side, reach the thalamus by pains and midbrain and go to its designated center in the brain, or cortex
 Huh
 anunalika ke saamne yah neeche ke bhaag dwaara bhi prerak tathaa samvedansutra anek bhaagon ko jate hai
 Combinations are also found here
 pouns varoliani - yah bhaag merushirsh or madhyamastishk ke bich main sthit he or donon anumastishk ke golardhon ko milaae rahata he
 In the picture, it appears as a round Urutsedh protruding towards the front
 mastishk kii piraksha karne par usapar anuprastha disha main jate hue sutara chhaae hue dikhaai dete hai
 These sutures pass through the innermost and midbrain into the perennial region

 yah bhaag pramastishk, anumastishk tathaa madhyamastishk se anek sutron dwaara judaa hua he or anek sutara merurajju main jate or vahaan se aate hai
 These sutras are grouped into masses
 ye vishesh sutarapunj hai: 1
 Pyramid path, 2
 Middle longitudinal axillary, and 3
 Middle capillary
 pyramid path main keval prerak sutara hai, jo pramastishk ke praantastha kii prerak koshikaon se nikalakar ant:samput main hote hue, madhyamastishk or pouns se nikalakar, merusheershak main aa jate hai or do punjon main ekatrit hokar rajju kii madhya parikha ke saamne or peeche sthit hokar neeche ko chale jate hai
 On reaching down, some sutras cross on the other side and some go down on the same side and then cross on the other side, but in the end all the sutras go to the other side

 In both public and private debates, the argument of the debate was presented in favor of either the moral acceptability of abortion for inducement or abortion, or to support laws prohibiting or prohibiting abortion
 chikitsiya garbhpaat par vishwa medical association ghoshnaptr kehete hai, "paristhitiyon main ek maan ke hit ko uske ajey bachche ke hiton ke saath sangharsh main laane main ek duvidha paidaa hoti he or yah sawaal uthaata he ki garbhavastha ko jaanboojhkar khatm kar diya janaa chahie yaa nahin
 "abortion debates, particularly those related to abortion laws, are often pushed forward by groups advocating one of these two conditions
 virdohi-garbhpaat samooh, jo purna nishedh sahit garbhpaat par adhik kanoonee pratibandhon kaa samarthan karte hai, ve aksar khud ko "samarthak jivan" ke rup main bataate hai, jabaki garbhpaat ke adhikaar samooh, jo is tarah ke kanoonee pratibandhon ke khilaaf hai, swayan ko "samarth vikalp" kehete hai

 unki kalam se bal sahitya kii rachana bhi hui he
 His first song is a poetry collection
 is sangrah main 1924 se 1928 tak ke rachit geet sangrahit hai
 Mahadevi Verma's own statement regarding the content of the neehar is remarkable - "in the time of the creation of the nehra my sensations were filled with the same kind of mixed anguish, like the inexplicable golden usha that appears in the mind of the child and away from the touch of the cloud
 Arises from the first vision of " in geeton main kautuhal mishrit vednaa kii swaabhaavik abhivyakti hui he
 Rashmi is the second collection of poetry by Mahadevi Varma
 isamen 1927 se 1931 tak kii rachanaayen hai
 In this, the contemplation and philosophy of Mahadevi ji seems to be outspoken
 atah anubhuti kii apeksha darshanik chintan or vivechan kii adhikta he
 In Rashmi's thinking and philosophy is more clear and mature

 She has reached that harmonious atmosphere where unhappiness becomes a pleasure and the sweetness of pain becomes the basis of her harmony

 i have songs composed from 1934 to 1936 AD
 in geeton man neeraja ke bhaavon kaa paripakv rup miltaa he
 Here, there is a coordination not only of happiness and sorrow but also of tears and anguish, union and disunity, hope and despair and liberation
 deepashikha main 1936 se 1942 i0 tak ke geet hai
 The main rendition of the songs in this collection is to erase the self and make others happy
 yah mahadevi kii siddhavastha kaa kavy he, jisamen sadhika kii aatma kii deepashikha akampit or achanchal hokar aradhy kii akhand jyoti main villin ho gai he
 i have composed compositions composed in the last days of Mahadevi that will overwhelm and surprise the readers, in the sense that the tone of compassion and compassion in Mahadevi poetry, which has become their identity since then
 'agnirekha` main deepak ko pratik maanakar anek rachanaayen likhi gayi hai
 There are poems on many subjects as well
 deepashikha main mahadevi verma ke geeton kaa adhikarik vishay ‘prem’ he
 But they have found the significance of love more than the jubilant moments of union, in the agony of violence
 saptaparna main mahadevi ne apni saanskrithik chetana ke sahare veda, ramayana, ther gaatha, ashwaghosh, kalidas, bhawabhooti evam jayadev kii kritiyon se tadatmya sthapit karke 39 chaynit mahatvapurn anshon kaa hindi kavyanuwaad is prastut kiya he
 Initially in the 61-page 'apni Baat', he has also presented a deeply researched discussion about this invaluable heritage of Indian Manisha and literature
 ’saptaparna’ ke antargat arshvani, valmiki, thergatha, ashwaghosh, kalidas or bhawabhooti ke baad saatven sopan par mahadevi verma ne jayadev ko pratishthit kiya he
 He has told that Radhakrishna had acquired a reputation as the hero-heroine of Sringa poetry of Sanskrit when Jayadeva emerged
 


mahadevi ji ne ’saptaparna’ main sanskrit or pali sahitya ke chaynit anshon kaa kavyanuwaad prastut karte samay apni drushti bhartiya chintanadhara or saundaryabodh kii parampara ke itihaas par kendrit rakhi he
 This work of his is fully capable of establishing him as a successful creative poet, historian and culture thinker, no doubt
 nihar jivan ke ushakal kii hi rachana he, jisamen satya kuhajaal main chipa rah kar bhi mohak or kutuhalapurna prathit hoti he
 'rashmi' is the creation of the early days of puberty
 jab satya kii kirane aatma main gyaan kii jwaala jagaa detii hai
 'neerja' is a work of adult mental state of the poetess, in which she scatters her Saurabh in her bright path in the bright light of day like Kamalini
 'sandhyagit' main jivan ke sandhyakaal kii karunardrata or vairaygy bhaavana ke saath-saath aatma kii apane aadhyatmik ghar ko laut chalane kii pravriti vartmaan he
 In 'deepshikha', the spirit of Jeevan Deep burning in front of Aaradhya in the calm, snug and zero atmosphere of the night is prominent
 is prakaar unhone apane jivan ke ahoratr ko in paanch pratikatmak sheershakon main vibhakt kar apni jivan sadhana kaa marm spasht kar diya he
 As a result of this solitary practice of anguish, the diversity of subjects in Mahadevi's poetry is very low
 unki kuch hi kavitaayen aisi hai, jinamein rashtriya or saanskrithik udbodhan athwa prakruti kaa swatantra chithran hua he
 Due to the theme and approach being the same in all the remaining poems, his poetry ground could not be expanded
 isse unke kavy ko haani or laabh donon hua he
 The disadvantage is that due to non-change of subject, there is a lot of monotony and mood in all his poetry
 laabh yah hua he ki simit kshetra ke bheetar hi kavyitri ne anubhutiyon ke anekanek ayaamon ko anek drushtikonon se dekh-parakhkar unke sookshmatisookshm bhed-prabhedon ko bimbarup main saamne rakhte hue chitrit kiya he
 In this way, his poetry may not have the expansive vastness and philosophical gravity, but the seriousness and importance of his feelings, the subtlety of the senses, the clarity of the images and the lack of imagination, are sure
 is tarah unke kavy vistaar kaa nahin gaharaai kaa kavy he
 The poems of Mahadevi are not descriptive and chronological
 aantarik sookshm anubhutiyon kii abhivyakti unhone sahaj bhavochhavas ke rup main kii he
 For this reason there is a multiplicity of semiotics and expressiveness in his expression system
 rupakaatmak bimbon or pratikon ke sahare unhone jo mohak chitra upasthit kiye hai, ve unki sookshm drushti or rangamayi kalpana kii shaktimatta kaa parichay dete hai
 He has taken these pictures from his perspective, especially the natural environment, but he took nature very little as a stand
 prakruti unke kavy main sadaiv uddipan, alankaar, pratik or sanket ke rup main hi chitrit hui hai
 For this reason, he has made the most familiar and all-seeing scenes or objects of nature a gift of his poetry
 uske asaadhaaran or alpaparichit drishyon kii ore unka dhyaan nahin gaya he
 Nevertheless, the full or partial images he has depicted by limited natural products give a complete introduction to his pictorial imagination
 isi kalpana ke darshan unke un chitron main bhi hote hai, jo unhone shabdon se nahin, rangon or tulika ke madhyam se nirmit kiye hai
 His paintings have been published with poems in 'deepshikha' and 'yama'
 mahadevi verma ne likhaa he- 'kala ke paras kaa sparsh paa lene vaale kaa kalakaar ke atirikt koi naam nahin, sadhak ke atirikt koi varg nahin, satya ke atirikt koi poonji nahin, bhav-saundarya ke atirikt koi vyapaar nahin or kalyaan ke atirikt koi laabh nahin
 'during the writing period, he remained unanimous and made meaningful things written in the spiritual creation of uninterrupted pace and the practice of a life of karma
 ek mahadevi hi hai jinhone gadhy main bhi kavita ke marm kii anubhuti karai or 'gadhyan kavinaa nikshan vadanti' ukti ko charitaarth kiya he
 The unique thing is that neither he wrote the novel, nor the story, nor the drama is still the best prose
 unke granth lekhan main ek ore rekhachitr, sansmaran yaa phir yatravrit hai to duusari ore sampadakeey, bhoomikaaye, niabandh or abhibhaashan, par sabamein jaise sampurna jivan kaa vaividhya samaaya he
 Without the help of imaginative poetic forms, a creator can earn so much in prose, it can be known only by reading Mahadevi
 hindi sahitya main chandrakantha mani ke samaan dravanshil karun ras kii devi mahadevi verma na keval vishisht kalakaar, kavyitri or gadhy lekhika hai apitu isse aage ek shreshth nibandhkaar bhi hai
 His prose, like poetry, does not take us away from life by forgetting it in beauty, it gives us inspiration to peek into real life by filling our veins with consciousness
 smriti kii rekhaaen or ateet ke chalchitr main nirantar jigyaasa sheel mahadevi ne smriti ke aadhaar par amit rekhaon dwaara atyant sahrudaytapurvak jivan ke vividh roopon ko chitrit kar un paatro ko amar kar diya he
 These include a very strong and compassionate picture of the poor, the poor people of the village, the villagers, the widows, the widows, the remarriages and the abusers due to alleged corruptions and old-marriage
 keval naariyaan hi nahin, upekshit purush varg kaa bhi mahadevi ne sahi chithran kiya he
 The sketches of Rama, Ghisa, Alopi and Badlu etc
 point to his extraordinary humanism
 mahadevi ne adhikansh apane rekhachitron main nimnavargeey paatro kii visheshtaon, durbalataaon or samasyaon kaa chithran kiya he
 Sevak Rama's voracious service, Bhangin Sabia's husband-loving and long-suffering, Ghissa's unquenchable devotion, the simple personality of the blind Alopi, the seller of greens, Kumbhakar Badlu and Radhiva's simple marital love, Pahari Ramani Lakshma's unmatched affection for Mahadevi -ability, swami-bhakti of old devotion and devotion, Karun-poignant life-story of Chinese youth, Parvatya Kuli Jangbahadur and his Anuj Coriander Mtta etc
 ranked sketches on a variety of subjects
 sabhi smriti-chitron ko mahadevi ne apane jivan ke bheetar se prastut kiya he, atah yah swaabhaavik hi he ki inamen unke apane jivan kii vividh ghatnaon evam unke charitra ke vibhinn anshon ko sthaan praapt hua he
 He has recorded his feelings as accurately as possible
 yahan yah ullekhneey he ki mahadevi ke rekhachitron main charitra-chithran kaa tatv pramukh rahaa he, kathanak uskaa angeebhoot hokar prakat hua he
 There is also enough inclusion of serious folk in these drawings
 'path ke saathi' main mahadevi ne apane samakaleen rachanakaaron kaa chithran kiya he
 The respect and intimate manner in which he has established the life-philosophy and temperamental greatness of these litterateurs is a great achievement in itself
 'path ke saathi' main sansmaran bhi hai or mahadevi dwaara padhe gaye kaviyon ke jivan prishth bhi
 He has made poetic mention of the closeness, intimacy and influence of litterateurs on the one hand and on the other hand, has tried to test his overall philosophy of life
 'path ke saathi' main kavindra rabindra, dadda, prasad, niraala, pant, subhadrakumari chouhan tathaa siyaaramsharan gupt kii rekhaayen shabd-chitra ke rup main ain hai
 The series 'links' comprise her reflective essays written in relation to social problems, especially the burning questions of the battered woman's life
 rachanaatmak gadhy ke atirikt 'mahadevi kaa vivechanaatmak gadhy' tathaa 'deepashikha', 'vama' or 'aadhunik kavi- mahadevi' kii bhoomikaaon main unki aalochanatmak pratibha ko aasaani se mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he

 rathyatra ke is mahotsav main jo saanskrithik or puranic drishy upasthit hota he use praaia: sabhi deshvasi sauhardra, bhai-chaare or ekta ke pariprekshya main dekhte hai
 The reverence and devotion with which everyone sits in the temple of Puri and receive the Mahaprasad of Shri Jagannathji together, automatically reflects the importance of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam
 utsaahpurvak shri jagannatha ji kaa rath khinchakar log apane aapako dhanya samajhate hai

 The world of microorganisms is very deaf
 sookshmjivon ke antargat sabhi jeevanu or orchia tathaa lagbhag sabhi protojoa ke alaava kuch kavak, shaiwal, or chakradhar aadi jeev aate hai
 Children of many other organisms and plants are also microorganisms
 kuch sookshmjeevigyaani vishaanuon ko bhi sookshmjeev ke andar rakhte hai kintu anya log inhen 'nirjeev' maanate hai
 Microorganisms are ubiquitous
 yah mrudaa, jal, vaayu, hamaare sharir ke andar tathaa anya prakaar ke praaniyon tathaa padpon main paae jate hai
 Where life is not possible, such as deep within geysers, where the temperature rises to 100 degrees Celsius, deep in the soil, several meters below snowflakes and high acidic environments are also found
 jeevanu tathaa adhikansh kavakon ke samaan sookshmjiviyon ko poshak media par ugaaya ja saktaa he, taaki vruddhi kar yah colony kaa rup le len or inhen nagn netron se dekha ja sake
 Such cultures are highly beneficial during studies on microorganisms

 maadak peya tathaa pratijaivik iske kuch udhaaharan hai
 To produce microorganisms on a commercial scale, large pots are required called 'fermenters' or 'fermenters'
 sookshmjeev kaa prayog pracheen kaal se wine, bear, hniski, brandi yaa ram jaise peyon ke utpaadan main kiya jaataa aa rahaa he
 The same yeast is used to make Saccharomyces sacrifici bread and to produce ethanol in malted rice and fruit juices

 The production of antibiotics by microorganisms is considered a very important discovery of the 20th century and a great achievement for the welfare of human society
 pratijaivik ek prakaar ke rasaynic padaarth hai, jinka nirmaan kuch sookshmjiviyon dwaara hota he
 It can retard the growth of other microorganisms or kill them
 painicilin sabase pehla antibiotic tha
 This antibiotic was widely used in the treatment of American soldiers injured in World War II
 panicilin ke baad anya sookshmjiviyon se anya antibioticon ko banaaya gaya
 Antibiotics have come as a force to increase our capacity to treat terrible diseases like plague, whooping cough, diphtheria, leprosy, which has killed millions of people in the world
 aaj ham antibioticon se rahit sansar kii kalpana hi nahin kar sakate hai
 Microorganisms are used extensively in commercial and industrial production of certain types of chemicals such as organic acids, alcohols and enzymes

 Enzymes responsible for the synthesis of cholesterol act like competition inhibitors
 ham jaanate hai ki pratidin nagar evam shaharon se vyarth-jal kii ek bahut badi maatr janit hoti he
 The major component of this waste water is the excreta of man
 nagar ke is vyarth jal ko wahiwamal bhi kehete hai
 It contains large amounts of organic matter and microorganisms which are mostly pathogenic
 wahiwamal kii badi maatr athwa shahari vyarthjal kaa rojaanaa niptaan kaise kiya jaay? ise prakritik jal sroton jaise nadi, jharne main sidhe visarjeet nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Before immersion, sewage is treated in the sewage plant so that it becomes pollution free
 sookshmjeev pratidin vishvabhar main vyarth jal ke lakhon-karodon galen pani ke upachaar main mahatvapurn bhoomika-nibhaate hai
 This system has been used in almost all parts of the world for centuries
 aaj ke din tak koi bhi manushya dwaara taiyaar kii gai praudyogiki wahit mel ke sookshmjivi upachaar ke saamne nahin tik pai
 Due to increasing urbanization, a much larger quantity of sewage is generated than before, hence the number of these treatment plants has not been increased enough to treat such a large quantity of sewage
 isliye apchaarit wahiwamal ko sidhe hi nadiyon main chhod diya jaataa he
 As a result, the number of pollution and water borne diseases is increasing
 vyarth jal kaa upachaar parposhit sookshmjeev se kiya jaataa he jo wahit mel main prakritik rup se vaas karte hai
 This treatment is performed in the following two stages- praathmik upachaar - upachaar ke is charan main wahit mel se bade-chote kanon ko nisyandan tathaa avsaadan dwaara bhautik rup se alag kar diya jaataa hai
 They are separated into different stages
 aarambh main tairte hue kooday-karkat ko anukramik nisyandan dwaara hataa diya jaataa he
 The chitabalukasham is then expelled by sedimentation
 sabhi thos jo praathmik aanpak ke neeche baithe kan hai, vah or plavi bahirisrav kaa nirmaan karata he
 The effluent is transported from the primary filtration tank for secondary treatment
 dwitiyak upachaar athwa jeev vigyaneey upachaar - praathmik bahirisrav ko bade vayuviya tinkon main se guzaara jaataa he jahaan yah lagaataar yantric rup se hilaayaa jaataa he or vaayu ko isamen pump kiya jaataa he
 This results in strong vigorous growth of beneficial airborne microorganisms in the form of energy
 vruddhi ke dauraan yah sookshmjeev bahirisrav main upasthit carbonic padaarthon ke pramukh bhaagon kii khapat karata he
 This significantly reduces the BOD of the effusion
 bi o di oxigen kii us maatr ko sanderbhit karata he jo jeevanu dwaara ek litre pani main upasthit carbonic padaarthon kii khapat kar unhen oxikrut kar den
 Sewage is treated until the BOD is reduced
 jal ke ek namoonay main sookshmjiviyon dwaara oxigen ke udgrahan kii dar kaa maapan bi o di pareekshan se kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, the measurement of organic matter present indirectly in water is BOD
 jab vyarth-jal kaa bi o di adhik hoga, tab isaki pradooshan kshamta bhi adhik hogi
 Once the BOD of sewage or waste water is reduced to a sufficient amount, the effluent is sent to the effluent tank where the bacterial herds convert it into sediment
 yah avsaad sakriyit aapank kehalaata he
 The active pumps the small part of the exhaust back into the aeration tank
 yah aapank niveshadravya kii tarah se kaary karata he
 The remaining core of the sludge is pumped into a large tank called anaerobic saponification
 yahan jeevanuon kii anya kismein jo avayuviya rup se vruddhi karti hai
 They digest bacteria and fungi present in the skin
 pachan ke dauraan jeevanu gaison kaa mishran jaise methane, hydrogen sulphide tathaa carbon diaksaide utpann karte hai
 This mixture of gases is called biogas
 chunki yah gas jvalansheel hoti hai, is kaaran inkaa prayog urja ke strot ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 The effluent from the secondary treatment plant is usually released into natural sources of water such as rivers, springs
 biogas kai gaison kaa mishran he tathaa sookshmjivi sakriyata dwaara utpann hoti he
 We know that during growth and metabolism, microorganisms produce various types of gaseous products
 jo gas utpann hoti he, vah in sookshmjiviyon dwaara khapat kiye gaye carbonic padaarthon par nirbhar karti he
 CO2 gas is mainly produced in the fermentation of wet flour, cheese manufacturing and production of beverages
 yadhyapi kuch bacteria jo sailulogy padaarthon par avayuviya rup se ugte hai vah CO2 tathaa H2 ke saath-saath badi maatr main methane bhi utpann karte hai
 These bacteria are collectively called methanogens
 inamen saamaanya jeevanu mithanobacterium he
 This bacterium is commonly found in anaerobic concentrated sludge
 yah jeevanu pashuon ke rumen main bhi paae jate hai
 a large quantity of cellulosic substances is available in the rumen
 rumen main yah jeevanu sailyulos ko todane main sahaayak hote hai or pashuon ke poshan main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaate hai
 Similarly, these bacteria are found in abundance in animal feces
 gobar main padpon ke sailulogy vyutpann prachur maatr main hote hai
