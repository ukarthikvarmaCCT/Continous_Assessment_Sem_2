 garuda puraana vaishnav sampradaay se sambandhit he or sanathan dharm main mrityu ke baad sadgati pradaan karne vaala mana jaataa he
 Therefore, there is a provision of listening to Garuda Purana after death in Sanatan Hinduism
 is puranake adhishthatri dev bhagwaan vishnu hai
 In it, with the glory of devotion, knowledge, disinterest, virtue, nishkam karma, many cosmic and otherworldly fruits have been described to instill all the common people in auspicious deeds such as yagna, charity, austerities etc

 Discourse of enlightenment is also its main subject
 atharah puraanon main garudamahapurana kaa apana ek vishesh mahatv he
 Its presiding deity is Lord Vishnu
 atah yah vaishnav puraana he
 The Garuda Purana describes Vishnu-bhakti in detail
the description bhagwaan vishnu ke choubees avtaron kaa varnan thik usee prakaar yahaan praapt hota he, jis prakaar 'shrimadbhagwat' main uplabdh hota he
 In the beginning Manu derives the origin of creation, the Dhruva character and the story of the twelve Adityas
 uske uparant surya or chandra grahon ke mantra, shiv-parvati mantra, indra se sambandhit mantra, saraswati ke mantra or nau shaktiyon ke vishay main vistaar se bataaya gaya he
 Apart from this, a detailed description of Shraddha-tarpan, measures of liberation and the movement of the creature is found in this Purana
 'garuda puraana' main unniis hajaar shloke kahe jate hai, kintu vartmaan samay main kul saat hajaar shloke hi uplabdh hai
 This Purana should be kept in two parts
 pehle bhaag main vishnu bhakthi or upasna kii vidhiyon kaa ullekh he tathaa mrityu ke uparant praaia: 'garuda puraana' ke shravan kaa praavdhaan he
 In the second part, describing in detail the phantom cycle, there is an account of the falling of the creatures in different hells

 maharishi kashyap ke putr pakshiraj garud ko bhagwaan vishnu kaa vaahan kaha gaya he
 Once Garuda asked Lord Vishnu many deep and mysterious questions related to the condition of the creatures after death, the yamlok-yatra of the creature, the hell obtained by various deeds, the vagaries and the misery of sinners
 us samay bhagwaan vishnu ne garud kii jigyaasa shant karte hue unhen jo gyaanamay upadesh diya tha, usee upadesh kaa is puraana main vistrut vivechan kiya gaya he
 It was through Garuda that after the death of Lord Vishnu from Shrimukh, esoteric and ultimate welfare words were revealed, hence this Purana is called 'garuda Purana'
 shri vishnu dwaara pratipaadit yah puraana mukhyatah vaishnav puraana he
 This Purana has also been called ‘main Garudi Vidya’
 is puraana kaa gyaan sarvapratham brahmaji ne maharishi veda vyas ko pradaan kiya tha
 After this Vyasji gave his disciple Sutji and Sutaji provided Shaunakadi sages in monastery at Naimisharanya

 manducopanishad atharvavedic shakha ke antargat ek upanishad he
 This Upanishad is written in Sanskrit language
 iske rachiyata vaidic kaal ke rishiyon ko mana jaataa he
 It describes the four states of the soul or consciousness - awake, dream, sleep and turia
 pratham das upanishdon main samavisht keval baarah mantron kii yah upanishad unamem aakaar kii drushti se sab se choti he kintu mahatv ke vichaar se iskaa sthaan unchaa he, kyonki bina vagvistaar ke aadhyatmik vidya kaa navaneet sutara rup main in mantron main bhar diya gaya he
 In this Upanishads, by giving a unique interpretation of the quantities of the higher, the origin and rhythm of the universe and the Brahm of the world and all three have been identified or impenetrable
 iske alaave vaishwanar shabd kaa vivaran miltaa he jo anya granthon main bhi prayukt he
 It has been said in this Upanishad that the eternal element which is prevalent everywhere in the world and in past, future and present times and even beyond it is 4
 yah sab brahm he or yah aatma bhi brahm he
 Aatma is Chatupadha, that is, the four stages of its manifestation are waking, dream, sleep and turia
 onkaar rupi aatma kaa jo swaroop uske chatushpad kii drushti se is prakaar nishpann hota he use hi uunkaar kii matraaon ke vichaar se is prakaar vyakt kiya gaya he ki uun kii akar maatra se vaani kaa aarambh hota he or akar vaani main vyaapt bhi he
 Sushupti local pragya is the makar volume of Umar in which the sound of Vishva and Tejas is like a rhythm in the Prajna, and the rhythm of Ukaar is like the sound of Ukaar, and the sound of Oom seems to be the sound of Mkaar coming out while repeating
 taatpary yah ki uunkaar jagat kii utpatti or lay kaa kaaran he
 Vishwavanar, like the Tejas and Prajna states, is bounded by the trivial Omkar Prapancha and rebirth, but like Turiya, there is only a very impracticable soul where the distinction of the living being, world and soul is not the real and only Advaita Shiva remains Shiva
 upanishdon ke rachanakaal ke sambandh main vidwaanon kaa ek mat nahin he
 Some Upanishads have been considered as part of the original codes of the Vedas

 Western historians consider him the father of trigonometry
 unhone apane vyavsaaykaal ke ant main apana prasiddh taron kii suchi banaai, lekin itihaas ke kisi mode par vah nasht ho gayi or vah mul rup se nahin bachi he
 He had reported at least 850 stars, which Ptolemy later added to his treasury named Almagast
 al-sufi ne bhi apane tarakosh ko banane ke liye tolmi ke zariye mili hipparkas kii taron kii fahrist kaa prayog kiya
 Hipparcus put all the stars into six categories based on their lightness
 jo bees sab se roshan taare the unhen 'ek' kii shrenee di gayi, us se kam roshan taron ko 'do' kii shrenee di gayi, vakairaah
 This method later became the standard method of measuring astronomical circles of stars in modern astronomy and is still used till date

 This can lead to algae function, that is, the number of algae starts to increase rapidly
 shaiwalon kii sankhya zyada samay tak kaayam nahin rah saktaa he or ant main unamem se adhikansh mar jate hai
 The decomposition of algae by bacteria uses so much aqueous oxygen that most or all of the animals die, creating more organic matter for bacteria to decompose
 anoxijnikaran karne ke alaava, shaiwal kii kuch prajatiyaan vifaille tatv utpann karti hai jo peya jal kii aapurti ko dooshit kar dete hai
 Nitrogen and phosphorus are required to be removed for various treatment processes
 nitrogen ko hataane kii kriya par ammonia se nitrate main nitrogen ke jaivik oxikaran ke madhyam se asar padataa he, jiske baad anitrikaran arthath nitrate se nitrogen gas main newnikaran hota he
 Nitrogen gas is released into the atmosphere and thus removed from the water
 nitrikaran apane aap main do charnon vaali ek viviya prakriya he, jisamen se prayek charan ko vibhinn prakaar ke jeevanuon dwaara sahaj banaaya jaataa he
 Oxidation of ammonia to nitrite is most commonly Nitrosomonas spp

 Denitrification requires anoxic conditions to encourage the creation of suitable biological communities
 ise jeevanu ke ek vyapak vivadhta dwaara sahaj banaaya jaataa he
 Sand filters, lagooning and reeds can be used to reduce nitrogen, but the catalyzed sludge process can perform this task most easily
 chunki anitrikaran dinitrogen gas main nitrate kaa newnikaran he, isliye ek electron daata kii jarurat he
 Depending on the wastewater, it may be an incorporated donor of the kind of organic matter, sulfide, or methanol
 akele nitrate main vifaille ammonia ke roopantaran ko kabhi-kabhi tritiyak prashodhan ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 In many sewage treatment plants, axial flow pumps are used to move nitriculated mixed chemicals from the aeration zone to the anoxic zone for denitrification
 in pampon ko aksar aatanrik mishrit rasayan punarchakran pampon pump) ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 The removal of phosphorus is important because it is a nutrient limiting the growth of algae in many fresh water systems
 yah khaas taur par jal punarprayog pranaaliyon ke liye bhi mahatvapurn hota he jahaan adhik phosphorus sankendran kii vajah se anupravahee upkaran karaab ho saktaa he, jaise - vipareet paraasaran
 Phosphorus can be removed biologically in a process called enhanced biological phosphorus removal
 is prakriya main, bahuphosphate sangraahak jeev naamak vishisht jeevanu chaynaatmak bhang se samrudh hote hai or apni koshikaon ke bheetar bahut adhik maatra main phosphorus kaa sangrah karata hai
 When the biomass stored in these bacteria is separated from treated water, the fertilizer value of these bio solids is much higher
 phosphorus hataane kii kriya ko rasinic avakshepan dwaara, aam taur par louh lavan, aluminium, yaa chuunaa ke saath, bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 This can produce a lot of sludge in the form of hydroxide sediment and the added chemicals can be expensive

 apshisht jal ke prashodhan main keetanushodhan kaa uddeshy - paryaavaran main waapas mukt kiye jane vaale jal main sookshmjivon kii sankhya ko kaaphi had tak kam karnaa he
 The effectiveness of disinfection depends on the quality of the water being treated, the type of disinfection used, the amount of disinfection used, and other environmental variables
 matamaile jal ko prashodhit karne main kam kamyaabi milegi kyonki thos padaarth jeevon ko, khaas taur par parabangnee prakaash se, dhank sakate hai, yaa yadi inase sampark karne kii aavriti kam ho
 In general, low contact frequency, low volume and high flow are all factors that inhibit effective disinfection
 keetanushodhan ke aam tareekon main shaamil hai - ozone, chlorine, parabangnee prakaash, yaa sodium hypochlorit
 peya jal ke liye istemaal kiye jane vaale chlormin ke satatya kii vajah se chlormin kaa istemaal apshisht jal prashodhan main nahin kiya jaataa he
 Chlorination remains the most common form of wastewater disinfection in North America because of its low cost and long-term history of effectiveness
 iskaa ek nuksaan yah he ki avshisht carbonic padaarth ke chlorinikaran se chlorine yukt carbonic yogic utpann ho sakate hai jo cancerkari yaa paryaavaran ke hanikaarak ho sakate hai
 Residual chlorine or chloramine may also have the ability to chlorinate organic materials in natural aquatic environments
 iske alaava, chunki avshisht chlorine jaleey prajatiyon ke liye vishaiylla hota he, isliye prashodhit gande jal ko rasinic drushti se chlorinviheen kar dena chahie, jisase prashodhan kii jatilta or laagat bad jaati he
 Ultraviolet light may be used in place of chlorine, iodine, or other chemicals

 In the UK, light is becoming the most common means of disinfection due to concerns about the effect of chlorine in residual organic matter in wastewater and chlorination of organic materials in receiving water
 edmonton or calgary, alberta or calovna, british colombia, canada bhi apane utpravahee jal keetanushodhan ke liye yuvi prakaash kaa istemaal karte hai
 Ozone O3 is produced when oxygen O2 passes through a high voltage potential that engages and transforms into the third atom of oxygen that produces O3
 ozone bahut asthir or pratikriyasheel hota he or yah sampark main aane vaale adhikansh carbonic padaarthon ko oxykrut kar detaa he, jisase kai rogajanak sookshmjeev nasht ho jate hai
 Ozone is considered to be safer than chlorine because unlike chlorine that is stored on site, ozone is produced on-site as needed
 chlorinikaran kii tulana main ozonikaran main kam keetanushodhan upotpaada utpann hote hai
 One disadvantage of ozone disinfection is that ozone-generating equipment costs more and requires specialized operators

 His spiritual creations are based on Vaishnava philosophy
 annamacharya ramanujacharya sampradaay ke the
 He took initiation from Sri Satagopa Yatindra at Ahobila Math
 
 He dwells on the subjects of morality, Dharma, righteousness, etc
 in his spiritual songs
 His erotic songs worship Lord Venkateswara by describing his amorous and romantic adventures, a tradition now known as Madhura Bhakti
 Most of these songs describe the adventures of Venkateswara and Alamel Manga, while others describe the Bhakti of Krishna's devotees
 He was one of the first few who opposed the social stigma towards the untouchable castes in his era, with his sankeertanas explaining that the relationship between God and human is the same irrespective of the latters' color, caste and financial status, in beautiful yet powerful usage of words in his song "brahmam Okkate Parabrahmam Okkate


" His choice of words gives a mellifluous tone to his songs, charming the listener
 His prodigious literary career that produced about 32,000 songs, many of which were greatly acclaimed, has earned him a place among the all-time greats of telugu literature
 His meeting with Purandara Dasa in Tirumala
 Once when Purandara Dasa visited Tirumala he heard a great old man singing his composition in front of the Almighty Srinivasa
 He at once approached the old man and said that the song was composed for practising music
 At the same time, Sri Sri Vyasaraya of the Vyasaraya mutt intervened and introduced the great old man as Talapaka Anammacharya to Purandara Dasa
 This is one of the major event in the history of Music where two great souls met each other and paid due respect to each other
purandara Dasa is revered as the Father of Carnatic Music who formulated the music as it is today
 The composition Sri Annamacharya sang is like Padumanabha Paramapurusha An ardent devotee of Lord Venkateswara of Tirupati, AP, Annamacharya successfully composed more than 32,000 sankeertanas in the Carnatic music tradition
 Though a great feat in itself, it still falls short of the estimated 475,000 sankeertanas composed by Purandara Dasa
 While enjoying popularity in his own days, his compositions were forgotten for over three centuries for some inexplicable reason
 They were later found engraved on copper plates, hidden for centuries inside the Sri Venkateswara temple at Tirumala
 Annamacharya considered his compositions as floral offerings to God
 In the poems, he praises Venkateswara, describes his love for him, argues and quarrels with the Lord, confesses the devotee's failures and apprehensions, and surrenders himself to Venkateshwara
 His songs are classified into the Adhyaatma and Sringaara sankeertanas genres
 Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams has been successfully endeavoring to preserve the rich heritage of his compositions
 The sustained efforts of dedicated scholars and musicians during the last thirty years have also helped revive their popularity among the Telugu people
 The sankeertanas engraved on copper plates were found in the Tirumala temple just opposite the Hundi, concealed in a very small room
 It is said only 12,000 of the 32,000 sankeertanas were found
 No leads have been available to trace the remaining sankeertanas
 Some personnel involved in deciphering the plates say that the people of those days could have melted the copper plates for personal use
 The telugu film "annamaya" was based on his story
 It was released on 13th May 1997
 It starred Nagarjuna Akkineni as Annamacharya
 The cast included ramyakrishna, Suman, Mohanbabu
