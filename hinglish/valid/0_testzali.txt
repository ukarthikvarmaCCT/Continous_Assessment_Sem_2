 Within six months of coming to Calcutta, he organized a huge labor rally in which a large number of people took part
 With this rally, even great freedom fighters like Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose got an idea of babuji's efficiency and leadership
 During this period Babuji worked with eminent freedom thinkers like Veer Chandrashekhar Azad and the well-known writer Manmathnath Gupta
 In the year 1934, when the whole of Bihar was suffering from the devastation of earthquake, Babuji made his move for the help and relief work of Bihar
 For the first time in Bihar, he met the most important, influential and non-violent freedom fighter of that period, the Honorable Mr
 Mohan Das Karamchand Gandhi i
e
 Mahatma Gandhi
 Mahatma Gandhi played a very important role in the political life of Babu Jagjivan Ram, Because Babuji knew that in the whole of India, there was only one freedom fighter who was fighting for both freedom and development of backward classes, and he was Gandhi
 All the other fighters used to choose either
 Babuji stopped this unjust act when the British were forcing the Dalits to commit mass conversions while adopting the 'divide and rule' policy
 After this development, Babuji became known as the most respected national leader of Dalits and became a trusted and beloved character of Gandhiji and entered the mainstream of Indian national politics
 In his student life, Babuji in the year 1934 in various districts of Calcutta, Sant Ravidas All India Ravidas Mahasabha was formed to celebrate the birth anniversary
 He formed two other institutions - 1
 Agricultural labor assembly 2
 In the year 1935, Babu Jagjivan Ram, the Indian Dalit Class Association, married Indrani Devi, the daughter of Dr
 Birbal
 Dr
 Birbal was an eminent doctor of Kanpur, while Indrani Devi Babu was greatly influenced by Jagjivan Ram's thoughts
 This married couple gave birth to a son after a few years named 'suresh' and a daughter named 'meera'
 It was only in 1935 that Babuji demanded the voting of Dalits before the Hammond Committee, which was accepted by the Hammond Committee

 This great politician has donated more than 50 spring of his life to Indian politics
 Babuji, one of the framers of the constitution, has always considered social justice to be paramount
 Pandit Nehru's famous statement to Babuji is as follows: 'A person with a socialist ideology has no hesitation in taking the greatest danger in raising the standard of living of the common people of the country
 Shri Jagjivan Ram is such a great person among them 'labor, Railways, Agriculture, Communication and Defense, Whatever ministry has been given to Babuji, welfare has always been done
 Babuji has worked tirelessly to promote the country with every ministry
 After being declared an independent country, the new government was fully responsible for the creation of India and Babuji's contribution in fulfilling this responsibility was very significant

 As Railway Minister, he overhauled the Indian Railways
 Babuji talked about the construction of modern railways in the context of the modern world
 He did not increase the railway fare by one rupee for five years, which was a historical event
 He laid more emphasis on the development of railway officers, officers and employees
 From the above sketch it can be concluded that the railway construction up to the year 1956-62 is more than any other year

 haalanki, adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki spindal neuron asian or africa donon prakaar ke haathiyon ke mastishk main bhi paae jate hai,:242 saath hi ye hampbek whale, fin whale, killer whale, sperm whale, bottlenos dolphin, risso dolphin or beluga whale main bhi paae jate hai
 The similarity between elephant's brain and man's brain supports the thesis of convergent development
 :154 Elephants are one of the societies of living species that are closely related to each other
 hathi ke parivaar ke sadsy keval maut ke kaaran hi ek duusare se alag hote hai, yaa unke kisi sadsy ko bandhak bana kar hi unhen alag kiya ja saktaa he
 Cynthia Mose, specializing in elephants, studied a family of African elephants
 parivaar ke do sadasyon par shikariyon ne goli chalaai, baad main bache hue haathiyon ne inkaa peechha kiya
 Although one elephant died, the other, an elephant named Tina, stood still, but her knees were responding
 parivaar ke do sadsy trista or terresia, tina ke donon or khadey ho gaye, unhone jhuk kar use khadey hone madad kii
 In the end, Tina became so weak that she fell to the ground and died
 haalanki, trista or terresia ne haar nahin maani, ve use uthaane kii koshish karte rahe
 He somehow made Tina sit, but her body was lifeless, she again fell to the ground
 tabhi parivaar ke anya sadsy bhi madad ke liye aa gaye, unhone tina ke munh main ghaas daalane kii koshish kii
 Teresia then placed her teeth under Tina's head next and tried to lift her
 jaise hi usne aisa kiya, uskaa daayan daant puri tarah se tut gaya, hoth or tantrika guha se baahar aa gaya
 The elephants stopped trying to pick him up but they did not leave him, instead, they started burying him in a shallow pit, putting leaves over his body
 ve puri raat vahin khadey rahe or subah vahaan se jane lage
 Terracea was added at the end
 hathi ek duusare se atyadhik nikatataa se jude hote hai, unamem matra-putr prem kii bhavanaaen hoti hai, kisi ek sadsy kii mrityu se unka parivaar tabah ho jaataa he, or kuch samooh to kabhi bhi apane samooh ko phir se nahin bana pate
 sinthia mos ne ek maa ke bachche kii mrityu ke baad uskaa prekshan kiya, vah kai dinon tak apane parivaar ke jhund main sabase peeche dhire dhire chalati thi
 Edward Topsell, in his book The History of for-footed Beasts in 1658, stated, "there is no animal in the world that can display so much ability and power, and so much intelligence, other than elephants
" isi prakaashan main unhone kaha ki hathi suraj or chandramaa kii puja karte hai or ek vishesh prakaar kaa vishaiylla paudha chabane se garbhadhaaran kar lete hai, inamen se donon hi baaten sach nahin hai
 Elephants are compared to chimpanzees in terms of their cooperation skills
 hathi ko atyadhik paropkaaree jaanavar mana jaataa he, vah sankat ke samay main yahaan tak kii manushya sahit anya prajatiyon kii bhi madad karata he
 In India, an elephant helping people lifting wood was walking in the back of a truck and placing wood in pre-made holes at the behest of his mahout
 ek nishchit chhed main, hathi ne lakdi ko rakhane se manaa kar diya
 Mahavat came to see and saw a dog sleeping in that hole
 hathi ne lakdi ko chhed main tabhi utaara jab kutta chalaa gaya
 Cynthia Mose has often found that elephants often change their ways, thinking that there is no harm to humans, they even do so when they have difficulty doing so themselves
 jois pool ne kuki galmen kii likepia raanch main colin frencombe ke dwaara ek ghatana kaa vivaran diya
 a shepherd was going with his camels when he encountered a family of elephants
 metriark ne us par hamalaa kiy, uski ek taang tut gayi
 In the evening, when he did not return, some men were sent to the truck to find him
 jab vah mila ek hathi uski raksha kar rahaa tha
 The animal attacked the truck, so they shot at him and tried to scare him
 baad main gadhriye ne use bataaya ki jab vah khadaa nahin ho paa rahaa tha, tab hathi ne apni sound se use uthaaya or ek ped kii chaaya main baitha diya
 He protected her all day and lightly touched her with his trunk
 africa main hathi borginasi parivaar ke ek ped kii pattiyaan chaba kar apana ilaaj karte hai, jo prasav pidaa ko prerit karata he
 Kenyan elephants also used this tree for the same purpose
 homo sepian sepian or nienderthal ke alaava hathi dharti par par ek maatr prajati he jo mrityu ke samay par vishesh anushthan karti he
 They take great interest in the ashes of their loved ones
 It is often seen that they are comfortably removing bones from their trunk and legs and the other elephants are sitting in peace
 kabhi kabhi aise hathi bhi mritak kii kabr par aa jate hai, jinka usase koi sambandh nahin hota
 When an elephant gets hurt, other elephants help him
 hathi shodhakarta martin meredith ne apni pustak main ek hathi kii mrityu ke anushthan ke bare main likhaa, ek dakshin africa jeev vigyaani anthoni maaikel haul iskaa chashmadid tha, jisane eddo, dakshin africa main aath saal se zyada samay tak haathiyon par adhyayan kiya
 The entire family of the deceased, including his young child, was stroking his body with a trunk, trying to raise him
 haathiyon kaa jhund jor jor se awaajen laga rahaa tha
 His child was crying and his sorrowful screams could be heard, but then the whole group suddenly calmed down
 phir unhone uske sharir par mitti or pattiyaan daalani shuru kar deen, use dhakne ke liye ped kii tahaniyaan todin
 ve agle do din tak chupchaap uske sharir par khadey hokar vyateet karte hai kabhi kabhi ve bhojan aurapani kii talash main chale jate hai lekin hameshaa laut aate hai
 This type of behavior of elephants around humans is common throughout Africa
 kai avasaron par, unhone mrit manushyon ko bhi dafnaaya he yaa dukh main unki madad kii he
 Meredith recalls another incident told to him by George Adamson, a Kenyan game warden, an old Ottoman woman forgetting her way home, sleeping under a tree
 jab vah jaagi, ek hathi uske upar khadaa tha or use pyaar se sahala rahaa tha
 She stabilized, because she was very scared
 ek or hathi vahaan aayaa, unhone jor jor se chillanaa shuru kar diya or use shakhaon ke neeche dafna diya
 The next morning the local shepherds found him waving, he was not hurt
 jorge adamson ek or ghatana ko yaad karte hai jab unhone ek samooh main ek bul hathi kaa shikaar kiya jo uttari kenya ke sarkari bageeche main ghus gaya tha
 George gave elephant meat to the local Turk tribesmen and dragged the rest of the body for a mile
 us raat, anya haathiyon ko uskaa sharir mila, unhone uski kandhe kii blade or taang kii haddi lee, thik usee sthaan par chale gaye jahaan hathi ko maaraa gaya tha
 Scientists often argue that elephants feel emotions
 jois pool ne kai baar junglee africa haathiyon ko khelte hue dekha he
 They often do many things to entertain themselves and others
 aksar dekha gaya he ki hathi pani ko apni sound main khinch lete hai, phir apni sound ko hawa main laharaa kar fawwaare kii tarah pani ko spray karte hai
 Recent studies have shown that elephants can imitate the sounds they hear
 yah tab paaya gaya jab ek anaath hathi ne paas se guzarate hue trakon kii aawaaj kii nakal kii
 Animals that have been known to mimic sounds so far include whales, dolphins, bats, primates, and birds
 23 saal ke ek africa hathi kelimero ek vishesh prakaar kii nakal kaa pradarshan kiya
 He accompanied the Asian elephants to the Swiss Zoo
 asian hathi chirp kii dhwani karte hai jo africa haathiyon kii gahari rambling dhwani se alag he
 Calimero also began to chirp, not making the typical deep voice of his species
 dakshin korea ke everland amujament park main ek bhartiya hathi, kosik ne prashikshakon ko hairaan kar diya jab usne apane prashikshak jong gap kim kii aawaaj kii nakal kii
 Kosik can copy eight Korean words including sit, no, yes and lie down
 uski nakal bilkul manushya kii aawaaj lagati he
 Kosik puts his trunk in his mouth, then shakes it while exhaling and makes a human voice
 yah kuch is tarah se karata he jaise log apane munh main anguli rakh kar siti bajaate hai
 Elephants make sounds to keep in touch with each other when they cannot see each other
 maadaa hathi in awaajon ko yaad bhi rakh sakate hai, is tarah se ve apane parivaar ke sadasyon ko bahari sadasyon se vibhedit kar lete hai
 They also differentiate between family units on the basis of how often these voices were heard
 haathiyon main upkarnon kaa istemaal kerani kii ullekhneey kshamta hoti he, ve apni sound kaa upyog bhujaa kii tarah karte hai
 Elephants dug potholes to drink water, uprooted the bark of a tree, chewed it up into a ball shape, filled a hole, covered it with soil to prevent evaporation, later Come back here and drink water
 ve aksar makkhiyaan udaane ke liye yaa apane aap ko khujali karne ke liye tahaniyon kaa upyog karte hai
 Elephants fall on a very large rock after lightning, so that it is destroyed or electricity is cut off
 kai anya prajatiyon kii tarah, hathi apni sound se brush ko pakad kar kalakaari bhi karte hai
 An example of this is shown in a TV program Extraordinary Animals, in which the elephant was painting a flower in a camp in Thailand
 haalanki chitra haathiyon ne hi banaaye the, lekin ek vyakti hameshaa unki sahaayta kar rahaa tha or unka maargdarshan kar rahaa tha
 From these representations, it cannot be said with certainty whether elephants are conscious of the figure of their painting
 ek hathi kaa asaadhaaran video vruttchitr jisamen hathi ek hathi kii tasviir bana rahaa he-sambhavatya aatm jaagrukta ko pradarshit karata he- yah internet samachar or video websit par bahut prasidd ho gayi he
 The quality of the painting is very high, seeing this many viewers expressed doubts about the veracity of the video
 website snopes
com, jo shahari kivdantiyon main visheshgy he, vah video ko "sach" bataati he, jisamen hathi brush se stroke bana rahaa he, lekin dhyaan den ki bani hui painting kii samanta hathi ke rachanaatmak prayaas ke bajaay siikhe gaye strokes ko darshaati he
 Elephants can spend long time solving problems
 ve nayi chunautiyon kaa saamana karne ke liye apane vyavhaar ko tadnusaar badal lete hai, yah ek jatil budhimatta kaa chinh he
 a 2010 experiment found that in order to get food, "elephants learn to help a partner in which two creatures are pulling two ends of the same rope to get the reward", their level of cooperation skills Are equivalent to chimpanzees in terms of
 1970 ke dashak main marine world africa, america main bandula naam kaa ek asian hathini rahati thi
 Bandula untied the shackles tied at her feet, or broke them
 sabase jatil upkaran tha brumal hook, yah upkaran tab band ho jaataa he jab do vipareet bindu ek saath khiskate hai
 Bandula slid the hook until these two points moved away from each other
 jab usne apane aap ko mukt kar liya vah duusare haathiyon ko bhi aaazaad karne main unki madad karne lagi
 In the case of Bandula and of course in the case of another hostage animal, the elephant also tries to cheat, as if he looks around to make sure no one sees him
 ek anya maamle main, ek maadaa hathi ne ek inch moti lohe kii chad ek ai hole kii madad se khol diya
 He used his trunk for this and untied the bolt
 phinics chidyaghar main ek asian hathini rubi aksar chhipakar apane rakhwale kii baaten sunati thi jab vah uske bare main baat karata tha
 She became very excited when she heard the word paint
 use haraa, pilaa, nila or laal rang pasand tha
 One particular day a truck arrived there, it was parked nearby, a man had a heart attack
 trek kii lit pile, laal or safed rangon main chamak rahi thi
 When Ruby later painted the same day, she chose these colors
 vah un rangon ko bhi praathamikta detii thi jo uske rakhwale ne pahane hote the
 Harry Peachey, an elephant trainer, developed a collaborative relationship with the cocoa salt elephant
 cocao apane prashikshak kii madad karti thi, uske rakhwale kai cmand dekar use protsaahit karte the or cocao kai shabd sikh gayi
 Peache said that elephants often start to cooperate in human work, if a sense of respect and sensitivity is kept towards them
 Coco worked at a time when the keeper needed "elephant help"
 ek baar ve maadaa haathiyon ke ek samooh ko kisi or chidyaghar main sthanantarit kar rahe the
 When keepers wanted to transfer a female, they usually used the word transfer after her name
 Coco soon understood its meaning
 agar rakhwale hathi ke sthantharan kii baat karte the to ve hilanaa band kar dete the, tab ve kehete the, "cocao mujhe haath do
" cocao yah sunakar madad karti thi
 After working with elephants for 27 years, Peachey strongly believes that he can understand the words and syntax of some words
 yah jantu varg main bahut hi durlabh lakshan he
 a study by Dr
 Naoko Iri of the University of Tokyo found that elephants also demonstrate skills in arithmetic
 prayog main "uno chidyaghar ke haathiyon ke saamne do tokariyon main alag alag sankhya ke seb daale gaye or yah darj diya gaya ki kitni baar hathi ne zyada falon vaali tokari ko uthaaya
" jab tokari main ek se zyada seb daale gaye, to iskaa arth yah tha ki "hathi ko is gananaa ke kul yoga ko apane dimag main rakhana hota tha"
 parinaam darshaate hai ki "74 pratishat baar jaanavar ne puri bhari sahi tokari ko hi uthaaya
 eshy namak ek africa hathi 87 pratishat kaa sabase zyada score banaaya
 isi pratiyogita main manushya keval 67 pratishat kii safalataa dar hi pradarshit kar paae
 " is adhyayan kii sateekta ko pramanit karne ke liye ise filmaaya bhi gaya tha
 Asiatic elephants have joined a small group of animals, including the great apes, bottlenose dolphins, magpie, which display self-awareness
 adhyayan kaa sanchaalan neuyork main bronks chidyaghar main haathiyon kaa upyog karte hue vanyajeev sangrakshan sosayadi ke saath kiya gaya
 Although many animals respond to mirrors, very few show evidence that they recognize that they are seeing themselves in the mirror
 adhyayan main paaya gaya ki asian hathi bhi isi prakaar ke vyavhaar kaa pradarshan karte hai jab ve 2
5 m-by-2
5 m ke darpan ke saamne khadey hote hai- ve aaine ke saamne khadey hote hai or khaane ke liye apane bhojan ko bhi darpan ke paas le aate hai
 Evidence of the elephant's self-awareness was found when Elephant Happy repeatedly touched the painted x on his head with his trunk, a mark that could only be seen in the mirror
 happy ne rangahin paint se banaaye gaye ek or nishaan par dhyaan nahin diya, yah nishaan bhi uske maathe par hi banaaya gaya tha, taaki yah sunishchit kiya ja sake ke vah paint kii gandh ke liye to pratikriya nahin kar rahi he
 France de Waal, who conducted the study, stated, "these similarities between man and elephant suggest that a convergent cognitive development is possibly related to complex societies and cooperation
 " Joyce Pool of the Amboseli Elephant Research Project, Kenya, has shown that elephants mimic sounds produced in the environment and by each other and literally try to learn them
 vah is disha main anusandhan kii shuruyaat kar rahi hai ki ye awaajen hathi kii boliyaan hai yaa jantu varg kii ek durlabh visheshta hai
 The issue of killing African elephants has been much debated in South Africa's Kruger National Park in terms of population control
 kuch vaigyanikon or paryaavarnavidon kaa kahana he ki unhen maarna "anaavashyak or amanviya" he chunki hathi kai tarah se manushya se samanta rakhte hai, unka mastishk manushya kii tarah he, ve saamaajik bandhan rakhte hai, ye lakshan unamem sahanubhuti, anubhuti, hoshiyaari ko darshaate hai

 The history of corruption in India is very old
 bharat kii aazaadee ke purv angranjon ne suvidhaayen praapt karne ke liye bharat ke sampann logon ko suvidhaswaroop dhan dena prarambh kiya
 By giving money to the nobles and moneylenders, they used to get all that they wanted from them
 angrej bharat ke raison ko dhan dekar apane hi desh ke saath gaddari karne ke liye kaha karte the or ye rais aisa hi karte the
 This corruption started from there and has continued to flourish since then

 Millions of people standing on both sides of the road watched the spectacle as mute spectators

 Due to the devastation of World War II, there was a huge shortage of essential goods in the whole world including Britain, which started a system of rationing to deal with it

 raaj kumaar, mrityu- 3 july 1996 mumbai) hindi filmon main ek bhartiya abhinayta the
 His name was Kulbhushan Pandit but in the film world he is famous by his second name 'raj Kumar'
 parmparik parsi theatre kii samvaad adaigi ko inhone apanaaya or yahi unki vishesh pahchaan bani
 Famous films played by him include Paagam, Waqt, Neelkamal, Pakiza, Maryada, Heer Ranjha, Saudagar etc
 hindi cinema jagat main yun to apane damdaar abhinay se kai sitaron ne darshakon ke dil par raaj kiya lekin ek aisa bhi sitara hua, jise sirf darshakon ne hi nahin balki puri film industry ne bhi 'rajkumaar' mana or vah the samvaad adaayagi ke betaj badshaah kulbhushan pandit urf rajkumaar
 Born on 8 October 1926 in Pakistan's Balochistan province, Rajkumar started working as a sub-inspector at Mahim police station in Mumbai after completing his graduation
 ek din raat main gasht ke dauraan ek sipaahi ne rajkumaar se kaha ki hajur aap rang-dhang or kad-lathi main kisi hero se kam nahin he
 If you become a hero in films, then you can rule millions of hearts, and this thing of a soldier was appreciated to the prince
 rajkumaar mumbai ke jis thane me karyrat the
 There was frequent movement of people associated with the film industry
 ek baar police stesan main film nirmaataa baldev dube kuch jaruri kaam ke liye aaye hue the
 He was impressed by Rajkumar's style of talking and offered Rajkumar to act as an actor in his film 'shahi Bazaar'
 rajkumaar sipaahi kii baat sunakar pehle hi abhinayta banane kaa man bana chuke the
 So he immediately resigned from his sub-inspector job and accepted the offer of the producer
 shahi bazaar ko banane main kaaphi samay lag gaya or rajkumaar ko apana jeevanyaapan karnaa bhi mushkil ho gaya
 Therefore, he accepted a small role in the film 'rangeili' released in the year 1952
 yah film cinema gharon main kab lagi or kab chali gayi
 Did not realize it
 is bich unki film 'shahi bazaar' bhi pradarshit hui
 Which fell at the box office
 shahi bazaar kii asafalataa ke baad rajkumaar ke tamaam rishtedaar yah kehane lage ki tumhaara cheharaa film ke liye upyukt nahin he
 And some people started saying that you can become a villain
 varsh 1952 se 1957 tak rajkumaar film industry main apni jagah banane ke liye sangharsh karte rahe
 After 'rangeeli', Rajkumar went on to accept whatever role he got
 is bich unhone 'anmol' 'sahaara', 'avasar', 'ghamand', 'neelmani' or 'krishna sudama' jaisi kai filmon main abhinay kiya lekin inamen se koi bhi film box offis par safal nahin hui
 Raj Kumar appeared in a small role of a farmer in the village of Mother India in the 1957 film Mahabub Khan's Mother India
 haalanki yah film puri tarah abhinetri naragis par kendrit thi phir bhi raaj kumaar apni choti si bhoomika main apane abhinay kii chhap chhodane main kaamyaab rahe
 He also gained international fame for his strong acting in the film and after the success of the film, Raj Kumar became established in the film industry as an actor
 varsh 1959 main pradarshit film 'paigaam' main unke saamne hindi film jagat ke abhinay samraat dilip kumaar the lekin raaj kumaar ne yahan bhi apni shashakt bhoomika ke zariye darshakon kii vaahvahee luutane main safal rahe
 After this, Raj Kumar through success in films like 'dil Apna Aur Preet Parai-1960', 'gharana- 1961', 'godan- 1963', 'dil Ek Mandir- 1964', 'dooj ka Chand- 1964' Adding to his acting among the audience, he reached a situation where he could choose his role in the film himself
 varsh 1965 main pradarshit film kaajal kii jabardast kamyaabi ke baad raaj kumaar bataur abhinayta apni alag pahchaan bana lee
 In the 1965 BR Chopra film Waqt, he was able to attract the attention of the audience once again with his excellent acting
 film vaqt main raaj kumaar kaa bolaa gaya ek samvaad "chinay seth jinke ghar shishe ke bane hote he wo dusron pe pathar nahin phenkaa karte yaa phir chinay seth ye churi bacchon ke khilne kii chiz nahin haath cat jaye to koon nikal aata he" darshakon ke bich kaafii lokapriy hua
 With the success of the film, Raj Kumar reached the bulls of fame
 aisi sthiti jab kisi abhinayta ke saamne aati he to vah manamaani karne lagata he or khyaati chaa jane kii uski pravriti badhati jaati he or jald hi vah kisi khaas image main bhi bandha jaataa he
 But Raj Kumar never tied in any particular image, so even after the success of these films, he did 'hamraaz- 1967', 'neelkamal- 1968', 'mere Huzoor- 1968', 'heer Ranjha- 1970' and 'pakiza- Even in 1971 ', she accepted a romantic role which did not match her film character, yet Raj Kumar was successful in winning the audience's heart here
 varsh 1978 main pradarshit film karmyogi main raaj kumaar ke abhinay or vividhta ke nae aayam darshakon ko dekhne ko mili
 In this film, he made his mark in two different roles
 abhinay main ekarupatha se bachane or swayan ko charitra abhinayta ke rup main bhi sthapit karne ke liye raaj kumaar ne apane ko vibhinn bhoomikaaon main pesh kiya
 In this sequence, he did not hesitate to play the character role in the film Bulandi released in the year 1980 and through this film, he also kept the mind of the audience
 iske baad raaj kumaar ne 'kudarat- 1981', 'dharmakanta- 1982', 'sharaara- 1984', 'rajtilak- 1984', 'ek nayi paheli- 1984', 'marate dam tak- 1987', 'surya- 1989', 'jangbaaj- 1989', 'police public- 1990' jaisi kai superhit filmon ke zariye darshako ke dil par raaj kiya
 In the film 'saudagar' released in 1991, new dimensions of Rajkumar's acting were seen
 subhash ghai kii nirmit is film main rajkumaar 1959 main pradarshit film 'paigaam' ke baad duusari baar dilip kumaar ke saamne the or abhinay kii duniya ke in donon mahaarathiyon kaa takaraav dekhne laayak tha
 In the nineties, Raj Kumar reduced his work to films
 is dauraan raaj kumaar kii 'tirangaa- 1992', 'police or mujrim insaaniyat ke devtaa- 1993', 'betaj badshaah- 1994', 'jawaab- 1995', 'god or gan' jaisi filmein pradarshit hui
 Raj Kumar, who was completely alone, probably felt that death was too close to him, so he called his son Puru Raj Kumar to him and said, "look, death and life are a personal matter of man
" meri maut ke bare main mere mitra chetan anand ke alaava or kisi ko nahin bataanaa
 To inform the film industry only after my last rites
 " Rajkumar, the Sartaj actor of the film world, left us on 3 July 1996

 jab dwitiyak vinding kaa vibhavaantar praathmik vinding ke vibhavaantar se adhik hota he to aise transpharmar ko ucchayi parinamitra kehete hai
 In contrast, when the voltage of the secondary winding is less than the voltage of the primary winding, such a transformer is called a catabolic transformer
 transafarmar kaa mukhya upyog vidyut shakti ko adhik voltata yaa kam voltata main badalanaa he 
 Doing so brings convenience and efficiency in the use of electrical energy

 This type of transformer is called a high transformer and if the voltage of the primary coil is greater than the voltage of the secondary, then the number of wraps in the primary coil N1 will be larger than the number of wraps of the secondary coil N2
 is prakaar ke parinamitra ko apchaayi parinamitra kehete hai
 Generally the nature of the transformer is determined by the following: saamaanya lod par saadhaaran shakti parinamitra kii dakshata bahut adhik hoti he, jo chote uniton main 90 pratishat se lekar bade parinamitron main 98 pratishat tak vicharit hoti he
 General: The efficiency of the transformer expressed in percent can be expressed as: parinamitron kii taatkaalik dakshata or din bhar kii dakshata main antar hota he
 The control of the transformer means the relation of secondary voltage in the case of full load and secondary voltage in case of no load when the input voltage is constant
 pratishat ke rup main vyakt karne par niyantran ko adholikhit rup main paribhaashit kar sakate hai: Controls are of the order of 2 to 5 percent for small transformers and about 1 percent for elders
 transafarmar ke mukhyatah do bhaag hote hai: 1) Core - which is made of a magnetic material

 His teaching work took place at Grove House School in Tottenham, but he was never able to earn a degree due to the death of his parents at a tender age and his conservative Quaker background
 After the death of his parents, he prepared himself to take over his family's business, but had to abandon the plan midway due to the initial symptoms of tuberculosis
 Admitting to advice on spending time in hot spots, Tiler left England in 1855 and moved to Central America

 During his travels Tylor also met Henry Christie, a Quaker and anthropologist and archaeologist, just like him
 christy se judane ke baad tiler main maanav shaastra ke prati gahari ruchi jaagi or isse pragaitihaasik adhyayanon ko shaamil karne ke liye unki jaanchon ko vyapak banane main madad mili
 Tyler's first publication was the result of his trip to Mexico in 1856 with Christie
 tiler ne logon se milane par unamem dharm par vishwaas evam unki dharmik prathaon ko janaa or usee aadhaar par apane lekh taiyaar kiye

 In 1871 Tiler was selected as a scholar of the royal society and in 1875 he received an honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law from Oxford University
 1883 main inako oxford main vishvavidhyalay ke sangrahalay main keeper ke rup main niyukt kiya gaya tha
 He also worked as a lecturer here
 1884-1895 kii samyavadhi main inhe pehle maanavvigyaan ke reader kii bhi oopaadhi mili
 He was also involved in the early history of the Pitt River Museum, although his involvement in it is a matter of dispute

 Tyler's ideology is well described in his most famous work, Primitive Culture, which is in two volumes
 pratham khand, samskruti kaa ooday nrivanshavigyaan ke vibhinn pahaluon ko sambodhit karata he jisamen saamaajik vikaas, bhashaa vigyaan or myth bhi shaamil hai
 The second section, titled Religion in Primitive Culture, mainly explains "zionism"
 tiler kii vichaardhaara kii vaastaviktaa ye hai ki unhen 'dharm kaa zimmedaar' samajha jaataa he
 Rather, there is a clear negative sentiment towards Tyler religion and especially towards Christianity
 aadim samskruti ke pehle prishth par, tiler ne ek akhil samaveshi paribhaasha, jo unke ek nrivigyaan or dharm ke adhyayan ke liye sabase vyapak rup se manyata praapt he, likhi he: "samskruti yaa sabhyataa, isaki vyapaktaa, nrivanshavigyaan ke arth main le liya jaye to yah puri tarah jatil he jisame kii gyaan, vishwaas, kala, naitikta, kanoon, riti rivaaj or anya kisi bhi tarah kii kshamta jo aadmi ne samaaj ke ek sadsy ke rup main grahan kii he
 " apane kai purvavartiyon or samakaleen ke vipareet, tiler ne kaha ki manushya kaa man or uski kshamtaye vishwa str par saamaajik vikaas main ek vishesh samaaj ke str ke vipareet ek hi hai
 This essentially means that a hunter-gatherer society will have as much knowledge as an advanced industrial society
 In this, Tiler found the difference that education makes a difference, it takes thousands of years to acquire knowledge and method
 yahi kaaran he ki tiler aadim samskruti ko ek bachche ki tarah samajhate hai or yah dekhaten hai ki samskruti or maanav mastishk vikaas ke maamle main pragati sheel hai
 One reason he wrote for this is to refute the theory of decadence, it was very popular at the time
 aadim samskruti ke ant main, tiler ne daawa kiya he ki
 "samskruti kaa vigyaan anivaary rup se ek 'sudhaarkon kaa vigyaan he
 " ek or shabd jiskaa shrey tiler ko jaataa he vah he unke "uttarjivita" kaa siddhant
 tiler kaa daawa kiya tha ki jab ek samaaj viksit hota he, to kuch reeti rivaaz jo ki ab samaaj main anaavashyak hai unhen pehle ke jaisaa hi rahane diya jaataa he jaise ki ghar main padaa bekaar kaa saamaan hota he
 To him the principle of survivorship is "process, custom and thought
" jo ki hamaari aadat ke jor par hi naye samaaj kii ore badhata he
 This new society is completely different from its old home and in this way it remains as evidence of old rites, out of which new rites have taken birth
 isamen kuch puraani prathayen bhi shaamil hai jaise ki europiin raktapaat
 jo ki lambey samay tak chali chikitsa padyatiyon jinpar yah aadhaarit tha baad main aadhunik takneekon se badal diya gaya
 Despite much criticism about survival, his originality in coining the term is still considered
 tiler ke jivan kii avadharana us samskruti ke lakshan ko paribhaashit karti he jo ki maanav sabhyataa ke pehle charan kaa pratibimb he
 According to Tyler, life means "processes, customs, ideas and more
 ye samaaj kii wo sthitiyaan hai jo hamaari aadat kii majaburi se sanchalit hoti hai or ye apane pehle ke ghar se badali hui hoti hai tathaa ye hameshaa hamaari puraani samskruti kii sthiti ke saboot evam udaraharan ke rup main rahati he
 This culture is now evolving into a new form "
 Studying life helps the anthropologists to re-construct previously established cultural traits and possibly also help in the development of culture
 uttarjivita ke rup main dharmai
 bi tiler kaa yah tark tha ki bhootkaal main dharm ko logon dwaara sansar kii ghatnaon kaa vivaran karne main prayog kiya jaataa tha
 He found that it is very important that religion should have the ability to explain logically all the events that take place in the world
 udhaaharan ke taur par bhagwaan ne hamen suraj isliye diya taaki hamen garmaahat or roshni milti rahe
 Tiler argued that Jeevatma is really the religion which every religion needs, it can answer that which religion came first and which religion is the basis of all religions
 unke liye to jeevatma hi in sabhi sawaalon kaa jawaab he, isiilie yah in sabhi dharmon kaa sahi aadhaar hona chaiye
 Describing the soul is said to mean believing in all beings to be souls
 tiler ne jis satya ko janaa ki samakaleen aadhunik dharmaparayan log bhi aatma par vishwaas karte hai
 This truth shows that these people were not more progressive than primitive society
 unke liye is baat se yah arth nikalataa he ki samakaleen aadhunik dharmaparayan log vishwa kii rahon ko nahin jaanate hai or in logon ko yah bhi nahin pataa he ki jivan kaise chalata he kyon ki unka gyaan ko vishwa ke bare main unki samaj par nirbhar karata he
 Even if scientific details are removed from the understanding of these incidents, then even today these pious people are semi-developed
 sabase aavashyak baat yah ki tiler aadhunik logon kii dharmaparayanata ko roodhiyon se bandhaa agyaan maanate hai
 In other words, these people believe in God only in order to survive, because the things that science now defines have already been described as rational by religion
