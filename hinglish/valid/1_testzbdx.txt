 Akbar, however, distinguished the case from previous episodes, where brothers or fathers of those queens enjoyed the same respect as daughters or sisters after Akbar's Muslim in-laws, except for eating and praying with them
 un rajputon ko akbar ke darbar main achche sthaan mili the
 All were adopted by him except a few conservative families who saw it as an insult
 anya rajpur rajavaadon ne bhi akbar ke sang vaivaahik sambandh banaaye the, kintu vivaah sambandh banane kii koi shart nahin thi
 The two major Rajput dynasties, the Shishodia of Mewar and the Hodha dynasty of Ranthambhore, always shied away from these relations
 akbar ke ek prasiddh darbari raja maansingh ne akbar kii ore se ek hadha raja surjan hadha ke paas ek sambandh prastaav bhi lekar gayi, jise surjan singh ne is shart par sweekaarya kiya ki ve apni kisi putree kaa vivaah akbar ke sang nahin karenge
 Ultimately, no marital relations took place, but Surjan was honored by handing over the bastion of garh-katang
 anya kai rajput saamanton ko bhi apane raajaaon kaa putriyon ko mughalon ko vivaah ke naam par dena acha nahin lagata tha
 Rathore Kalyanadas of Garh Siwan also threatened to kill Mota Raja Rao Uday Singh and Jahangir, as Uday Singh decided to marry his daughter Jodha Bai to Akbar's son Jahangir
 akbar ne ye gyaan hone par shahi phujon ko kalyandas par akraman hetu bhej diya

 inke dwaara jansadharan kii dhwani akbar ke darbar tak pahunchaa karti thi
 Due to increasing interaction between the Hindu and Muslim courtiers of the court, exchange of ideas and possible progress in both religions
 isse agali peedi main donon rakton kaa sangam tha jisane donon sampradaayon ke bich sauhaard ko bhi badhaava diya
 As a result, the Rajputs became the most powerful assistants of the Mughals, the Rajput generals stayed in the Mughal army and won many wars
 inamen gujarat kaa 1572 kaa abhiyaan bhi tha
 Akbar's policy of religious tolerance opened up jobs and employment opportunities for all in the royal administration
 iske kaaran prashasan or bhi drudh hota chalaa gaya
 In the erstwhile society, prostitution was patronized by the emperor
 uski ek bahut badi haram thi jisame bahut si striyaan thim
 Most of the women were abducted and kept there
 us samay main sati pratha bhi joro par thi
 Then it is said that some of the people of Akbar, who saw the beautiful woman being Sati, would forcefully stop being Sati and tell the Emperor's orders and put the woman in the harem
 haalanki is prakaran ko darbari itihaaskaaron ne kuch is dhang se kaha he ki is prakaar badshaah salaamat ne sati pratha kaa virodh kiya va un ablaa striyon ko sangrakshan diya
 In his biography, Akbar himself has written - If i had got this intelligence already, i would not kidnap any women of my sultanate in my harem
 is baat se yah to spasht hi ho jaataa he ki vah sundariyon kaa apharan karwaata tha
 Apart from this, the futility of the matter of not kidnapping is also known from the fact that the harem was closed neither in Akbar's time nor in his time
 aaine akabari ke anusaar abdul kaadir badayunni kehete hai ki begmein, kuleen, darbario kii patniyaan athwa anya striyaan jab kabhi badshaah kii seva main pesh hone kii ichha karti hai to unhen pehle apane ichha kii soochna dekar uttar kii pratiksha kerani padati he; jinhen yadi yogya samajha jaataa he to haram main pravesh kii anumati di jaati he
 Akbar used to force his subjects to collectively organize naked performances of the women of his house, which Akbar named Khudroz

 At the time of Akbar's accession in 1556, the Portuguese had built a number of fortifications and constructions on the west coast of the continent and largely controlled shipping and maritime trade in that region
 is upniveshwaad ke chalate anya sabhi vyapaaree sansthaaon ko portugaliyon kii sharton ke adheen hi rahanaa padhata tha, jis par us samay ke shaskaon va vyapaariyon ko aapatti hone lageen thim
 The Mughal Empire made Gujarat the first target after Akbar's coronation and won the first victory on the sea coast in 1572, but keeping in view the power of the Portuguese, for the first few years he only took a pass called Kartaz to travel in the Persian Gulf region
 Kept going 1572 main surat ke adhigrahan ke samay mughalon or portugaliyon kii pratham bhent hui or portugaliyon ko mughalon kii asli shakti kaa anumaan hua or faltah unhone yuddh ke bajaay niti se kaam lenaa uchit samajha va portugali rajyapal ne akbar ke nirdesh par use ek rajdoot ke dwaara sandhi prastaav bheja
 Akbar accepted the proposal of his harem and other Muslim people from that area with a view to securing Hajj's visit to Mecca
 1573 main akbar ne apane gujarat ke prashasnic adhikariyon ko ek farmaan jari kiya, jisamen nikatavartti daman main portugaliyon ko shanti se rahane diye jane kaa aadesh diya tha
 In return, the Portuguese issued passes for the family of Akbar to go to Haj
 1576 main main akbar ne yahya saleh ke netritv main apane haram ke anek sadasyon sahit hajiyon kaa ek bada jattha haj ko bheja
 The batch arrived in two ships from Surat at Jeddah port in 1577 and proceeded to Mecca and Medina
 1577 se 1580 ke bich chaar or kaaravaan haj ko ravaanaa hua, jinke saath makka va madina ke logon ke liye bhenten va garibon ke liye sadake the
 These travelers belonged to the economically lower class of society and their departure increased the economic burden on those cities

 After much controversy, he was forced to read his return

 Due to these cases, Akbar had to stop the visits of the Hajis
 1584 ke baad akbar ne yaman ke samrajya ke adhinsth adan ke bandargah par portugaliyon kii madad se chadhaai karne kii yojana banaayi

 1587 main ek portugali tukdi ne yaman par akraman bhi kiya kintu turk nausena dwaara haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 After this, the mughal-portuguese alliance also got a shock as the Portuguese were being continuously pressurized in Janjira by the Mughal Jagirdars
 akbar ek musalmaan tha, par duusare dharm evam sampradaayon ke liye bhi uske man main aadar tha
 As the age of Akbar changed, so did his interest in religion
 use visheshkar hindu dharm ke prati apane lagaav ke liye janaa jaataa hai
 He married many Hindu princesses, unlike his ancestors
 iske alaava akbar ne apane rajya main hinduo ko vibhinn rajasi padon par bhi asin kiya jo ki kisi bhi bhootpurv muslim shaasha ne nahi kiya tha
 He had come to know that in order to rule India for a long time, he should give proper and equal place to the original inhabitants here
 hinduon par lage jazia 1562 main akbar ne hataa diya, kintu 1575 main muslim netaaon ke virodh ke kaaran waapas lagaana padaa, haalanki usne baad main nitipurvak waapas hataa liya
 Jiziya tax was imposed on poor Hindus to take refuge in Islam after being forced out of poverty
 yah muslim logon par nahin lagaaya jaataa tha
 Due to this tax, many poor Hindu population was burdened, due to which they used to convert to Islam
 firoz shah tughlaq ne bataaya he, ki kaise jazia dwaara islam kaa prasar hua tha
 Akbar's occasional decision to lift the tax on Jaziya and Hindu pilgrimage had little effect on the Hindus, as it did not benefit them much, as they were withdrawn after some interval
 akbar ne bahut se hinduon ko unki ichha ke viruddh bhi islam grahan karavaaya tha iske alaava usne bahut se hindu tirth sthanon ke naam bhi islamic kiye, jaise 1583 main prayag ko elahabaad kiya gaya
 It was during the reign of Akbar that one of his warriors, Hussain Khan Tukriya, forced the Hindus to force discriminatory spectators on their shoulders and arms

 Once he went out to Jwalaji along with his villagers to see the goddess
 jab uskaa kafila dilli se gujara to mughal badshaah akbar ke sipaahiyon ne use roak liya or raja akbar ke darbar main pesh kiya
 When Akbar asked Dhyanu where he was going with his villagers, Dhyanu replied that he was going to visit Jotwali
 akbar ne kaha teri maa main kya shakti he ? or vah kya-kya kar sakati he ? tab dhyanu ne kaha vah to puure sansar kii raksha karne vaali hai
 There is nothing that she cannot do
 akbar ne dhyanu ke ghode kaa sar katwa diya or kaha ki agar teri maa main shakti he to ghode ke sar ko jodakar use jivit kar den
 Hearing this word, Dhyanu started praising Goddess and cut off her head and offered it to Mata as a gift
 mata kii shakti se ghode kaa sar jud gaya
 Thus Akbar realized the power of the goddess
 badshaah akbar ne devi ke mandir main sone kaa chhatra bhi chadhaaya
 But he was proud in his mind that he brought the umbrella of gold, then the mother dropped the umbrella from his hand and made it of a strange metal which is a mystery till date
 yah chhatra aaj bhi mandir main maujuud he
 Historian Dasharatha Sharma says that we call Akbar great according to the history and narratives of his court such as Akbarnama, etc
 yadi koi anya ullekhneey kaaryon kii ore dekhe, jaise dalpat vilaas, tab spasht ho jayega ki akbar apane hindu saamanton se kitna abhadra vyavhaar kiya karata tha
 Hindus boycotted the temple because of Akbar's Navratna king Mansingh's construction of Vishwanath Temple after Akbar's permission
 kaaran saaf tha, ki raja maansingh ke parivaar ke akbar se vaivaahik sambandh the
 The Hindu feudatories of Akbar could not get the temple built without his permission
 bengal main raja maansingh ne ek mandir kaa nirmaan bina anumati ke aarambh kiya, to akbar ne pataa chalane par use rukvaa diya or 1595 main use masjid main badalane ke aadesh die
 The extent of outrage for Akbar is revealed by an incident
 hindu kisaanon ke ek netaa raja ram ne akbar ke makbare, sikandra, agra ko luutane kaa prayaas kiya, jise sthaneey faujadaar, mir abul fazal ne asafal kar diya
 Shortly thereafter, Raja Ram reappeared at Sikandra in 1688 and taking advantage of the delay in the arrival of Shaista Khan, he made a dent in the tomb and looted many valuable things, such as gold, silver, precious carpets, lamps, etc
 And those who could not take them were ruined
 raja ram or uske aadamiyon ne akbar kii asthiyon ko khod kar nikaal liya evam jala kar bhasma kar diya, jo ki muslimon ke liye ghor apmaan kaa vishay tha
 In later years, Akbar was also attracted towards other religions
 akbar kaa hindu dharm ke prati lagaav keval mogul samrajya ko thos banane ke hi liye nahi tha varan uski hindu dharm main vyaktigat ruchi thi
 Apart from Hinduism, Akbar was also interested in Shia Islam and Christianity
 isai dharm ke moolbhoot siddhant jaanane ke liye usne ek baar ek portugali isai dharm prachaarak ko goa se bula bheja tha
 Akbar had built a special place in the court called ibadat-khana, where he used to have religious discussions with various religious leaders and preachers
 uskaa yah duusare dharmon kaa anveshan kuch muslim kattarpanthi logon ke liye asahneeya tha
 He began to feel that Akbar was deviating from his religion
 in baton main kuch sachai bhi thi, akbar ne kai baar rudhivaadee islam se hat kar bhi kuch faisle liye, yahan tak ki 1582 main usne ek naye sampradaay kii hi shuruyaat kar di jise deen-e-ilaahi yani ishwar kaa dharm kaha gaya
 Akbar created a new religion called din-i-ilahi in 1582, in which the core elements of all religions were inserted, mainly Hindu and Islam religions
 inke alaava parsi, jain evam isai dharm ke mul vichaaron ko bhi sammilit kiya
 However, he did not do much industry for the promotion of this religion, but only included his trusted people in it
 kaha jaataa hai ki akbar ke alaava keval raja birbal hi mrityu tak is ke anuyaayi the
 According to dabestan-e-mazhab, only 19 people adopted this religion after Akbar
 kalantar main akbar ne ek nae panchang kii rachana kii jisame ki usne ek ishwariya samvath ko armbh kiya jo uske hi rajbhishek ke din se prarambh hota tha
 He wrote "allah-o-akbar" on the back of the coins which was the word Anakarthi
 akbar kaa shabdic arth he "mahaan" or ‘‘allaah-o-akbar’’ shabd ke do arth ho sakate the "allaah mahaan hai " yaa "akbar hi allaah hai"
 din-e-ilahi was, in true sense, a religion rather than a code of conduct
 isame bhoga, ghamand, ninda karnaa yaa dosha lagaana varjit the evam inhe paap kaha gaya
 Kindness, thoughtfulness and moderation were its pillars
 yah tark diya gaya he ki deen-e-ilaihi kaa ek nayaa dharm hone kaa siddhant galat dharna he, jo ki baad main british itihaaskaaron dwaara abul fazal ke kaaryon ke galat anuwaad ke kaaran paidaa hua tha
 However, it is also accepted that the policy of sulah-i-kul, which had the essence of din-i-ilahi, was adopted by Akbar not just for religious purposes but as a part of the general imperial administrative policy
 isane akbar kii dharmik sahanubhuti kii niti kaa aadhaar banaaya
 At the time of Akbar's death in 1605 there was no sign of dissatisfaction among his Muslim subjects, and a theologian like Abdul Haq had the impression that close relations remained
 nirakshar hote hui bhi akbar ko kalakaaron evam buddhijivio se vishesh prem tha
 Due to this love of his, there were nine very quality courtiers in Akbar's court which is also known as Akbar's Navratna
 akbar kaa vyaktitv bahucharchit rahaa he
 Therefore, Indian literature and cinema have created many characters inspired by Akbar

 Neither the French nor the Germans were in favor of Del Monte, and the Emperor had ostensibly excluded him from the list of acceptable candidates, but the French were able to block the other two factions, allowing Del Monte to compromise himself More to be promoted as the candidate to be elected

 Julius' Popatia was marked by scandals, the most notable of which centered around the Pope's adopted nephew, Inocenzo Sigoli del Monte

 After Julius was promoted to Pope, the Pope's brother adopted the Inocenzo del Monte family and, Julius then immediately created a cardinal-nephew
 julius ne vorona main mont saint-mishael ke mont saint-mishael or verono main saint xene main abhyarthiyon, or baad main, saint sabaa, mirmundo, grotafretata or fraskati ke abbasiyon ke saath-saath unke pasandida ke saath apane pasandida pradarshan kiya
 As rumors began regarding a special relationship between the pope and his adopted nephew, Julius refused to take advice
 Cardinal Reginald Poole and Giovanni Caraffa warned the pope "for bad ideas, for which the advancement of an immoral youth" Will increase "

 The court and poet Girolomo Muzio, in a letter from Milan governor Ferrante Gonzaga to 1550, wrote: "they write many bad things about this new pope, he is dirty, and strange in the head," and the pope's Scandall, in the theater of the judgment of the enemy god, made Thomas Bearard the capital, stating that it was Julius' "customs

 One result of the head-nephew scandal was the elevation of the position of Pope secretary of state, as the incumbent was unfit to perform the duties of Inocenzo del Monte: the secretary of state eventually replaced the cardinal-nephew of the most important officer in the Holy See

 Different religions have different views about abortion
 Below is a brief description of it
 garbhpaat ke vishay main koi bhi buddha dharm kuch bhi nahin kahata
 Traditional sources, such as the Buddhist Monastery's Code, suggest that life begins at conception, which ends with abortion, which can be called intentional destruction of life and should be avoided
 adhikttar buddha dharmavalambi bhi isse sahamat hai
 a more in-depth study reveals that "life is a continuation without a direct starting point"
 dalai lamas ke anusaar garbhpaat ek "rinatmak" pravriti he lekin apwaad bhi hai
 He explained, "my guess is that abortion should be accepted or rejected according to each situation"
 isai dharm main garbhpaat ke sambandh main bhinn-bhinn vichaar hai
 Some intellectuals are opposed to the old Christian views and some people still believe that having an abortion or getting it done is similar to killing a living person
 puranic hindu granthon ke anusaar garbhpaat ko dridhtaa se aparaadh mana gaya he
 According to the BBC, "when it comes to abortion, it is chosen in Hindu law which includes: the least harm to the parent fetus and the community
 " bibisi ke anusaar, "yadhyapi vyaavhaarikta main bharat kii hindu sabhyataa main garbhpaat prachlit he, kyonki garbhpaat par dharmik pratibandh kabhi-kabhi saanskrithik variyata beton ke liye hone ke kaaran iskaa ulanghan kiya jaataa he
 Under this, the girl is removed before birth through abortion and this is called female feticide or female feticide
 " hindu vidwaanon or mahila adhikaron kii vakaalat karne vaale log ling-aadhaarit garbhpaat ko pratibandhit karne ke paksh main hai
 Some Hindu theologians and Brahmakumari believe that the fetus begins in three months and develops in five months of pregnancy
 sambhawatah tisare maheene tak garbhpaat kii anumati di jaani chahie or iske baad kiya jane vaala garbhpaat aatma praapt kar chuke sharir ke vinaash ke samaan he
 Although Islam scholars do not agree on when life begins and when abortion can be allowed, most according to 120 days after conception - the time when according to Islam the fetus is born as a living soul It seems, to end it - is prohibited
 kuch islamic vichaarkon ke anusaar garbhadhaaran ke shuruaati chaar maah main garbhpaat kii anumati keval usee avasthaa main honi chahie jab maan kaa jivan khatre main ho athwa koi balaatkaar kaa maamla ho
 Traditional Jews teach abortion permission only when the mother's life is in danger
 jabaki sudhaarwadi, punarnirmanvadi or anudaarpanthi andolanon main surakshit or sulabh garbhpaat ke adhikaar ke liye khule aam isaki vakaalat kii gai, jabaki paramparanishth andolan mudde par ekikrut najar nahin aaye
 Although Sikh texts do not directly state abortion, it is generally prohibited in Sikhism as it is considered to be against the creation of God
 is saidhantik drushtikon ke baavjood, bharat ke sikh samudaayon main garbhpaat asaamaanya nahin he, vahaan par purush pradhan samaaj evam saanskrithik pasand main beton ko adhik mahatv dene ke kaaran maadaa bhrun hatya hoti he

 Nirvana literally means 'extinguished'
 kintu buddha, jain dharm or vaidic dharm main iske vishesh arth hai
 The Shramana ideology has a state of freedom from suffering or grief
 paali main "nibbaan" kaa arth he "mukti paanaa"- yani, laalach, ghrinaa or bhram kii agni se mukti
 This is the ultimate truth of Buddhism and the main principle of Jainism
 kii shrenee kaa hissaa Although the use of the word nirvana in the sense of 'liberation' is found in the new and old texts of the Gita, Bhagavata, Raghuvansh, Shariak Bhashya, etc
, the term is the definition of Buddhists
 sankhya, nyaay, vaisheshik, yoga, mimasaa or vedant main kramshah moksh, apvarg, nickshreyas, mukti yaa swargaprapti tathaa kaivalya shabdon kaa vyavhaar hua he par buddha darshan main baraabar nirvana shabd hi aayaa he or uski vishesh rup se vyakhya kii gai he
 There are two main branches of Buddhism - Hinayana and Mahayana
 inamen se hinayan shakha ke sab granth paali bhashaa main hai or buddha dharm ke mul rup kaa pratipaadan karte hai
 The Mahayana branch is somewhat behind and all its texts are written in Sanskrit
 mahayan shakha main hi anek aacharyon dwaara buddha siddhanton kaa nirupan gudh tarkpranali dwaara darshanik drushti se hua he
 In ancient times, the Buddhist masters of Vedic Acharyas with whom they spoke were often from the Mahayana branch
 atah nirvana shabd se kya abhipraay he iskaa nirnay unheen ke vachanon dwaara ho saktaa he
 The Bodhisattva Nagarjuna has written in the Madhyamika Sutra that 'the eradication of bhavasantati is nirvana', that is, by our rites, we fall into the bondage of birth again and again, this eradication can destroy destruction
 ratnakutasutra main buddha kaa yah vachan haih raag, dwesh or moh ke kshay se nirvana hota he
 In the Bajrakshaika, the Buddha has said that nirvana is imperishable, there is no sacrament in it
 madhyamik sutarakaar chandrakirti ne nirvana ke sambandh main kaha he ki sarvaprapanchanivartak shoonyata ko hi nirvana kehete hai
 What is this emptiness or nirvana! Neither can it be called emotion, nor lack
 kyonki bhav or abhaav donon ke gyaan ke kshap kaa hi naam to nirvana he, jo asti or naasti donon bhaavon ke pare or anirvachaneey he
 Madhvacharya has also stated the same meaning of emptiness in his Sarvadarshanasangraha - 'asti, Nasti, Umbhaya and Anubhimaya are nothingness from this quadrant
 madhyamik sutara main nagarjun ne kaha he ki astitv or naastitiv kaa anubhav alpbuddhi hi karte hai
 Wise people get the welfare of both of them
 upyukt vaakyon se spasht he ki nirvana shabd jis shoonyata kaa bodhak he usase chitt kaa grahyagraahakasambandh hi nahin he
 i am false, the world is also false
 ek baat dhyaan dene kii he ki buddha darshanik jeev yaa aatma kii bhi prakrut satta nahin maanate
 They consider nothing more than a non-zero
 kii shrenee kaa hissaa The Buddha described nirvana as that ultimate peace of mind that goes beyond craving, anger and other agonizing states of mind
 aisa praani jisane jivan main shanti ko paa liya he, jiske man main sabhi ke liye dayaa ho or jisane sabhi ichchhaaon or bandhanon kaa tyaag kar diya ho
 yah shanti tabhi praapt hoti he jab sabhi vartmaan ichchhaaon ke kaaran samaapt ho jaaen or bhavishya main paidaa ho sakane vaali ichchhaaon kaa jad se naash ho jaae
 nirvana main trishna or dwesh ke kaaran jad se samaapt ho jate hai, jisase manushya sabhi prakaar ke kashton yaa sansar main punarjanm ke chakra se chhot jaataa he
 There are also other approaches to nirvana in Pali principles; According to one, it is the same as finding vacancies in any fact
 At the same time it is also shown as a whole rearrangement of consciousness and opening of layers of conscious
 vidwaan harbart gintar kaa kahana he ki nirvana se "adarsh vyaktitv, sachcha insaan" vaastaviktaa ban jaataa he
 In the Dhammapada, the Buddha says that nirvana is the "ultimate bliss"
 yah anand chirsthai or sarvopari hoti he jo gyanoday yaa bodhi se praapt hone vaali shanti kaa ek abhinn ang he
 This pleasure is completely different from the happiness of mortal things
 nirvana se judaa hua gyaan bodhi shabd ke madhyam se vyakt hota he
 The Buddha interpreted Nirvana as a "spontaneous" mind
 aisa man jo ichchhaaon ke ant ke kaaran purna spashtataa or subodhgamyata kii sthiti main pahunch gaya he
 Buddha described it as "deathlessness") and ultimate spiritual enlightenment, which is the natural result that one gets when leading a virtuous life and walking on the perfect eight-point ideal path
 aise jivan se karm or wan kii sandhi se bana he
 Nir means "separation, away or without" and Vana means "liberation" such as "flowing air" and "sniffing, etc
"
 abhidharm-mahavibhasha-shaastra, jo ek sarvastvaadi vichaar he, main is shabd ke sanskrit se utpann sabhi sambhavit arthon kaa varnan he: Nirvana has never been considered as a place in the sutras, rather it is considered a paradox of the world, which is actually synonymous with ignorance
 
 kaha gaya he: The exact meaning of nirvana is the attainment of knowledge - which eliminates the identity of the mind and creates an attachment to the basic fact
 saidhantik taur par nibbaan ek aise man ko kaha jaataa he jo "na aa rahaa he or na ja rahaa he " or usne shashvatata kii sthiti ko praapt kar liya he, jisase "mukti" milti he
 Stability, coolness and peace also have its meanings
 nirvana kii prapti kii tulana avidya ke ant se kii jaati he
 Which awakens the desire for that state of mind which frees the life cycle
 sansar mulat: trishna or agyanta kii upaj he 
 vyakti bina mrityu ke bhi nirvana kii prapti kar saktaa he
 When a person who has attained nirvana dies, that death is called moksha], because he is completely missed by the last connection of life and death and rebirth and is not born again
 Buddhism considers the end of worldly existence the ultimate goal and this is the attainment of nirvana; What happens after the death of such a person cannot be explained by parinirvāṇa, because this experience is beyond the limits of human understanding
 kai prashnon kii ek shrinkhalaa ke madhyam se shariputt ne ek bhikshu se manvaaya ki tathagat ko apane vartmaan jivan main bhi satya yaa vaastaviktaa nahin mana ja saktaa, aise main arhant kii mrityu ke pashchaat kii sthiti par atakalein lagaana sahi nahin hoga
 dekhen tathagat # inascrooteble After attaining a level of knowledge, one experiences nirvana like mental consciousness
 kuch dharanaon ke anusaar agar nibbaan ke raste par chalaa jaae to ye arhant ko gyaan prapti or samadhi kii ore le jaataa he
 If the yogi realizes that this situation is artificial and therefore mortal, when reaching this state by the development of the inner being, then all the bonds end, the person becomes arahant and attainment of Nibbana
 man jaagruk he; yah chetan he
 Nirvana opens consciousness and the mind becomes free from all the shackles of this uneasy world and becomes aware
 buddha ne is baat kaa kai tarah se varnan kiya he
 One of these is as follows: chetana niraakaar he, iskaa koi ant nahin he or ye sabhi taraf se tejasvi he
 Ajan Pasanno and Ajan Amaro write that the term science is seen in terms of the quality of Chetan
 unke mutabik "vinyaan" ko uske shabdic arth se kahin adhik samajha janaa chahie: "buddha ne apane samakaksh kai darshanikon kii tarah vidya ke aadambar or paakhand ke bajaay ek bade daayre main aam logon kii samaj main aane vaali bhashaa kaa prayog kiya, jisase unka sandesh adhik se adhik samajha ja sake
 isliye 'vinyaan' ko yahaan par 'jaanane' ke arth main liya ja saktaa he, lekin aanshik tutaa-phuta, bhedbhaavparak jaananaa nahin, jo aamtaur par iskaa arth lagaaya jaataa he
 Rather it should mean preliminary and excellent knowledge, otherwise the contradiction will appear in the context in which it is being spoken
 "he then explained what could have been the reason behind the selection of these words
 This" latent consciousness "six senses Is different from the consciousness of others, the rest of the consciousnesses have a "surface", which causes a reaction
 peter harvey ke anusaar pracheen granthon main is mudde par do raay he ki "chetan" shabd sateek he yaa nahin
 ek mukt vyakti iskaa sahaj rup se anubhav karata he
 According to one interpretation, "prakaswan Chetan" is similar to Nirvana
 duusare isse sahamat nahin he, unke anusaar ye nirvana nahin he, balki ye ek prakaar kii chetana he jo keval arhantko hi praapt hoti he
 In the Majjhima Nikaya it is described as a blank space
 mukt vyaktiyon ke liye nibbaan se judi hui prakashwan sahaj chetana, maansik chetana ke dhyaan kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti or ye maansik chetana ke sabhi bhaagon se utkrisht hoti he
 This is completely different from the concept of enlightenment of the former Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, which speak of awakening the inner consciousness of a person, while it does not emphasize this aspect and is not confused with "self" in any way
 needed
 Furthermore, according to the sixth meditation of the Buddha, it excels in the field of unlimited consciousness, which itself does not end on the pretense of "I"
 nagarjun ne bhi dignikaay main chetana ke str par do sthanon par sanket die hai
 He wrote: sadhu ne ghoshnaa kii ki prithvi, jal, agni or vaayu, lanbaa, chota, maheen or kadaa, acha ityadi sabhi chetana main bujh jate hai
 

 Here long and short, fine and hard, good and bad, all these names and forms cease
 isi se judaa vichaar, jise paali siddhant or samakaleen therwaad main samarthan mila he, jabaki therwaad bhashya or abhidhamm main iskaa ullekh nahin dikhataa, ye kahata he ki arhant kaa man hi nibbaan he
 In Mahayana Buddhism, both nirvana and samsara are seen as the ultimate nature of dharmakayi, both of them are not separate
 ek vyakti buddha path se nirvana kii prapti kar saktaa he
 It would not have been possible if these two were completely different
 That is, the dualism of nirvana and samsara is traditionally accurate
 is nishkarsh par pahunchane kaa ek or rasta yah vishleshan he ki sabhi tathy ek aavashyak pahchaan se rikt hote hai, isliye pidaa kisi bhi paristhiti main janmajaat nahin hoti
 isliye du:kha or uske kaarnon se mukti koi abhautik prakriya nahin he
 For further explanation of this idea, see Dualism
 theravadamat sansar or nibbaan ke bich paraspar virodhabhas ko darshata he, jahaan se mukti kii khoj shuru hoti he
 At the same time, this contradiction also leads to the ultimate goal, which is to truly excel in the world and attain salvation through Nibbana
 theravadakai myanon main mahayan mat se bhinn he, jo khud bhi sansar or nirvana ke dwaitvaad se shuru hota he, is dhruvikaran ko yah sirf ek aarambhik paath ke taur par nahin dikhaata he, balki aage jaakar ye advaitvaad ke vrihad anubhav kii ore le jaataa he
 From the point of view of the Pali Sutra, the sufferings and stagnation of Buddha and Arhant, i
e
 samsara and nibbana are different
 donon hi mat is baat par sahamat he ki shakya muni buddha isi sansar main rahete hue nirvana ko praapt hue, kyonki unhen sabhi ne sansar se mukt hote hue dekha tha
 Vishuddhimarg Ch
 I, v
 6, Buddhaghosha has shown several options in the Pali doctrine for the path of Nirvana, including: kisi ke vishleshan ke aadhaar par, ye sabhi vikalp buddha ke bataae gunon, maansik vikaas or gyaan ke teen sutreey shiksha ko hi nae sire se dikhalaataa he
 The idea of showing Nirvana as a pure, non-dualistic 'transcendent mind' is also found in Mahayana / Tantric texts
 samput, udhaaharan ke liye, yah varnan karata he: Empty from lust and emotional defect, on which there are no clouds of dualistic outlook, such an excellent mind is indeed the ultimate nirvana
 ' According to some Mahayana traditions, Buddha is seen in the Marichika, in which the visible person is shown as rising above the state of nirvana
 professor atian lamote ke anusaar, buddha hameshaa or har samay nirvana main rahete hai or unka bhautik sharir or dharti par rup vastav main chhadam he
 Lamote writes of the Buddha: 'he was born, he attained enlightenment, he pursued the cycle of dharma and attained nirvana
 However, this is all an illusion: Buddha's precept is the omission of the stages of coming, staying and going; His nirvana indicates that he is always and at all times in a state of nirvana
 ' Some Mahayana sutras try to explain the characteristics of the nature of Nirvana going forward
 mahayan mahaparinirvana sutara, ke mukhya vishyon main mulat: nirvana kii seemaa yaa dhaatu hi he, isamen buddha chaar aavashyak ghatakon kii charchaa karte hai jisase nirvana kaa nirmaan hota he
 One of which is 'self', which is analyzed as Buddha's permanent self
 mahayan ke aadhaar par nirvana ko samajhaate hue wiliam edward soothilaur lui hods kehete hai: 'nirvana Sutras claim that ancient ideas like stability, ecstasy, personality, purity lead to excellent nirvana
 mahayan ye ghoshnaa karata he ki hinayan, ye nakaarte hue ki utkrisht kshetra main koi vyaktitv hi nahin hota, darasal buddha ke astitv ko hi nakaarte hai
 In Mahayana, the ultimate nirvana is transcendent and is labeled the ultimate
 ' When this scripture was written, many positive things had already been said about Nirvana and Buddha
 buddha dharm ke shuruaati vichaar ke anusaar, nirvana ko sthayitv, harsh or shuddhta se darshaya gaya he
 It is shown to be in retaliation for the "I am" posture and is beyond all possibilities of self-development
 mahaparinirvana sutara, jo mahayan kaa lanbaa or vrihad shaastra he, buddha ko gaiyr-buddha logon par vijay ke liye "swayan" kaa prayog karte hue dikhaaya he
 From this it is further stated: "buddha's nature is not his own
 samvedansheel praaniyon ke maargdarshan ke liye swayan kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 " isi se judaa shaastra ratnagotra vibhaag, kahata he ki tathagatagarbha kii shikshaayen samvedansheel praaniyon ko jeetne kii drushti se or "swayan se judaav" ko samaapt karne ke liye he - gaiyr buddha shiksha kii paanch main se ek kami
 lankavatar sutara main yoru vaing ne bhi aisi hi bhashaa kaa prayog paaya he, phir likhte hai: "ye dekhte hue ki ye sandarbh aavashyak he
 This will prevent us from coming to the conclusion that from the idea of tathagatagarbha it was just a supernatural fantasy
 " haalanki, kuch logon ne mahaparinirvana sutara se jude is nishkarsh par aapatti kii he or daawa kiya he ki buddha ne in panktiyon main swayan kii vaastaviktaa par bal dete hue ghoshnaa kii he ki wo hi swayan hai: 'due to many reasons and circumstances, i also taught that myself is beyond myself
 jabaki vastav main swayan he, maine ye sikhaaya ki koi swayan nahin he lekin isamen kuch galat bhi nahin he
 Buddha-metal is self-contained
 jab tathagat ye shiksha dete hai ki koi swayan nahin he, to wo aisa anadi ke kaaran karte hai
 The Tathagata are themselves and they teach not to be themselves because they have attained sovereignty
 ' The Buddha in the Nirvana Sutra states that he will now teach the principles kept secret so far and his earlier teaching on non-self was based on justification
 dow kosho yamamoto likhte hai: 'he says that the non-self he taught earlier is nothing but justification in that context
 

unhone ye bhi bataaya ki ab wo gopneey gyaan ke bare main baat karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 The person also follows contrary thoughts
 to ab vah nirvana ke sakaaratmak gunon kii baat karenge, jo kuch or nahin balki shaashvat, harsh or shuddh hi hai
 ' kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar, tathagatagarbha prakruti ke sutron main jis bhashaa kaa prayog kiya gaya he unamem sakaaratmak bhashaa main ashrith utpatti se buddha shiksha par jor dikhataa he jisase log buddha dharm se dur na hone lag jaaen or is shiksha ko nihilism ke samaan na samaj baithen
 udhaaharan ke liye, kuch sutron main gaiyr-swayan ke purna gyaan ko hi sachcha swayan kaha gaya he; is path ke param lakshya ko phir kaaphi sakaaratmak bhashaa se samajhaayaa gaya he jo bharat ke darshan shaastra main upyog kii jaati rahi he, lekin ab ise nai buddha shabdaawalee kaa hissaa bana liya gaya jisase us vyakti ke bare main samajhaayaa ja sake jisane buddha path ko safaltaapurvak purna kar liya ho
 Dr
 Yamamoto explains that the 'positive' depiction of nirvana is in fact associated with a higher degree of nirvana - called 'mahanirvana'
 nirvana sutara ke 'bodhisattva mahaan paramatma raja' paath ke bare main baat karte hue yamamoto khud hi dharmagranth kaa sahaara lete hai: 'nirvana kya he? 


ye kuch isi prakaar he ki bhukhe vyakti ko wo shanti or harsh mil jaae jaise uske pet main kuch bhojan chalaa gaya ho
' yamamoto uddhran jari rakhte hai, saath hi apni tippanee bhi jodate hai: "but, such nirvana cannot be called" Mahanirvana "
 And he also contemplates "maha Swayam", "maha Harsha" and "maha Purity" which are the four qualities of Maha Nirvana like all Sanatana
 ' According to some scholars, the interpretation of "self" here and in related formulas does not in fact represent enough self
 darasal, yah ek sakaaratmak bhashaa main riktata kii abhivyakti he or buddha prathaon ke madhyam se buddhatv kii prapti kaa suchak he
 In this view the aim of 'tathagata Garbha' / Buddha's teaching is liberation-scriptural and not theoretical
 baharhaal, ye vyakhya vivaadaaspad he
 Not all scholars have this opinion
 nirvana sutara or sambandhit shastron main tathagatagarbha siddhant ke vividh gyaan par likhte hue, dow jemi habird kehete hai ki kis tarah kuch viddhan tathagatagarbha main param tatvvaad or advaitvaad kii prakruti kii taraf jhukaav pate hai 
 dow habird kii tippaniyan: 'matsumoto said that there are many similarities in the very positive language and motivational way of knowledge in the Tathagata Garbha
 saath hi unhen atman / brahman parampara main paryaapt advaitvaad dikhaa
 jaahir he, matsumoto ne hi sirf is samanta kaa ullekh kiya he, aisa nahin he
 For example, Takasaki Jikido, who is considered a scholar of the Tathagatagarbha tradition, saw Advaitaism in the doctrines of the Tathagatagarbha and Mahayana 


 Obermiller in his translation linked the notion of the Advaita supreme principle to the Tathagatagarbha tradition and commented on the Ratnagotra
 , Which he aptly named as "the Manual of Buddhist Monotheism"
 

lamote or frowalnar ne tathagatagarbha siddhant ko madhyamika se thik ulat bataaya or unhone use atman / brahman ke advaitvaad se judaa hua bataaya, jabaki nagaao, sefort royag or jonston jaise kuch logon ne sirf apane andeh jaahir kiye or kaha ki ye vedon ke samay ke baad ke advaitvaad se mail khaataa he
 Another view, represented by Yamaguchi Susumu and his student Ogawa Ichijo, succeeded in understanding Tathagatagarbha without Vedic ideas and found it only in the Buddhist tradition of emptiness and causality that outrightly rejects any monotheism
 
 jaahir he, tathagatagarbha or buddha parampara kii advaitvaad yaa shaashvat prakruti se jude prashn jatil hai
 Dr
 Hubbard summarizes his research on the principles of Tathagatagarbha with these words: 'tathagatagarbha kaa gyaan hameshaa se hi bahes kaa mudda he, kyonki vah satya or gyaan ke liye behad moulik sakaaratmak drushtikon rakhata he, vaastaviktaa kaa varnan nakaaratmak sandarbh main nahin yani jo usamen kami he yaa riktata he uske sandarbh main nahin, balki sakaaratmak varnan jaisaa ' According to Paul Williams, congruence can be explained in monotheism of Atman / Brahmin thought
 jab nirvana sutara gaiyr buddha saadhuon ko jeetne ke liye apni shiksha saamne rakhe: At this time there is something interesting about the Hindu influence on Buddhism
 lekin sirf prabhaavon kii baat karnaa behad aasaan he
 

 Saying this, the Mahaparinirvana Sutra itself assumes a kind of Hindu influence, when it speaks of the Buddha using 'himself' to conquer non-buddhist monks
 phir bhi, ye sochna galat hoga ki advait vedant ke utkrisht swayan brahman is samay buddha dharm ko prabhavit karte hai
 It is not clear anywhere that the self which means in the Mahaparinirvana Sutra can be compared to the Advaita Brahman anywhere and this Tathagatagarbha Sutra is older than the Gaud verse, which is called the founder of Hindu Advaitaism
 sutara ye bhi kahata he ki buddha kii prakruti vastav main swarahit he, lekin baatcheet ke aadhaar par ye swayan kehalaati he
 In the second section of the same sutra, it is stated that there are three ways by which a person can "get" something; Achieve in the past, achieve in the present and achieve in the future
 It states that "all have the nature of Buddha" means that all will become Buddha in future 

 However, Dozen has clearly stated that the nature of Buddha is present in some contexts even in the present -also in Buddhism: Actually comparing reality with the present, it was linked to Buddha nature, which included grass, trees, mind and body all
 dojan ke liye kisi bhi vastu ko dekhnaa athwa buddha kii prakruti ko dekhnaa he
 Whereas Chinul believes that it exists in the body like the ability to smell and see
 mahatvapurn lankavatar sutara main kaha gaya he ki sabhi kaary buddha kii prakruti ke kaaran hai, har karm kii niyati yahi kaaran or jad he
 As suggested above, the Japanese Zen Guru Dozen has a completely different interpretation of Buddha nature, in which the 'whole form' is seen as Buddha nature and nothing is different from it
 The nature of Buddha is not just about 'ability to be Buddha', but it is the nature of everything in the world
 sabhi vasteen apane asthayitv main buddha prakruti kii tarah dekhi gai hai or wo kisi buddha prakruti ke liye 'kshamta' kaa pramaan nahin he
 Dr
 Masao Abe writes on this understanding: '


 dojan kii samaj main, buddha prakruti kisi kshamta kaa pramaan nahin, wo koi beej nahin he jo har samvedansheel vyakti ke paas ho
 balki har samvedansheel vyakti, yaa kahen har vastu, jivit yaa mrit asal main buddha prakruti hi he
 This is not an ability which will show form in future, this is the basic nature of everything
 dojan ne is tarah buddha prakruti or 'samvedansheel vyaktiyon' ke vichaar ke daayre ko badhaate hue, lagbhag sari chizon ko samet liya, wo sari chijen jo jivit hai, jinamein buddhi he or jo buddha prakruti hi hai
 Dr
 Masao Abeis explains: '


 dojan ne na sirf buddha prakruti ke arth kaa dayera badhaayaa he, balki samvedansheel vyaktiyon ko bhi vrihadata pradaan kii he
 In "busho", "the whole personality is the nature of the Buddha
" " ye kehane ke fouran baad wo kehete hai, "main sampurna vyakti kii 'samvedansheel praaniyon' kii ikai ko avibhajya maanata hum"


 yani dojan ne shujo kaa dayera badha diya he, jo paaramparik rup se keval jivit yaa samvedshansheel vyaktiyon ke liye upyog main laayaa jaataa tha, ab isamen mrit or asamvedansheel vasteen bhi shaamil hai
 In other words, he has spoken of giving life in dead objects, giving feelings in insensitive things and finally giving Buddha and Buddha nature in all
 '
 In Jainism this means opening the last bond of karma
 When an enlightened human being such as an Arihant or Tirthankara destroys his remaining abrasive deeds / Ahagatya Karma thus ending his earthly existence, then this stage is called Nirvana
 takneekee taur par, ek arihant ke sharir ko tyaag dene ko athwa unke sharir kii mrityu ko nirvana kaha jaataa he, kyonki unhone sansar main apane astitv ko samaapt karke mukti ko paa liya he
 Moksha means liberation after liberation
 nirvana kii prapti ke baad ek arihant siddh ban jate hai, ek mukt vyakti
 Nirvana in Jainism means: jain dharm ko maanane vaale diwaali ko 24wein tirthankar mahavir bhagwaan ke nirvana kalyanak diwas ke rup main manaate hai
 Nirvana Day is described as 'nirvana Kalyanak Divas' in Jainagam
 shwetambar manyata anusaar kalpasutra main mahavir ke nirvana par vistrut jaankaree he
 According to Shwetambara belief, it has been told in the Uttaradhana Sutra that how Gautama explained the meaning of Nirvana to KC, who was a disciple of the latter

 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin

 nasiruddin shah hindi filmon ke ek prasiddh abhinayta hai
 Naseeruddin Shah, who is said to be an instrument of performance in the Hindi film industry, hardly anyone would mind
 naseer kii kaabiliyat kaa sabase bada subut he, cinema kii donon dhaaraon main unki kamyaabi
 If Nasir's name is included in the list of the best actors of parallel cinema, then he has achieved great success in Bollywood mainstream or commercial films too
 naseer apane shandaar andaaj se mukhya dhara ke chahete sitare ban gaye, aisa sitara jisane har tarah ke kirdaar ko behtareen abhinay se jinda kar diya
 Whenever this star came on screen, the character left a memorable impression on the heart of the beholder
 uski kamedi ne public ko khub gudgudaya to ection main bhi uskaa alag hi andaaj najar aayaa
 Naseeruddin Shah's journey into mainstream cinema began with the 1980 film Hum Paanch
 film bhale hi vyapaarik thi, lekin isamen naseer ke abhinay kii gaharaai samanaantar cinema vaali filmon se kam nahin thi
 In a village that considered slavery as its destiny, Nasir killed himself in the character of a young man who raised the voice of rebellion
 haalanki film box offis par kaamyaab nahin rahi or ek vyapaarik actor ke taur par safalataa sabit karne ke liye naseer ko tikat khidki par bhi bikaoo banane kii jarurat thi
 And for them, this work did 'jaane Bhi Do Yaaron'
 bollywood kii ol time best kamedi filmon main shumaar 'jane bhi do yaaron' main ravi vaasavani or naseer kii jodi ne bejod comic timming dikhaai or film behad kaamyaab rahi
 But Nasir's biggest success in commercial cinema was 'masoom'
 baap or bete ke rishton ko ukerti 'maasoom' main naseer ne kamaal kii adaakaari se naa keval khub vaahvahee batori balki film bhi superhit hui or naseer ko ek star kaa darja mil gaya
 This star status of Naseer was further strengthened by Subhash Ghai's multistarrer megabuzz film 'karma' which came in 1986
 film main naseer ke liye apni chhap chhodana aasaan nahin tha kyonki vahaan abhinay samraat "dilip kumaar bhi the
 And the new stars of that era were Jackie Shroff and Anil Kapoor as well
 1987 main gulzaar kii 'ijaajat' naseer ke liye kamyaabi kaa ek or jariya ban kar ai
 a passionate story, excellent direction, superb acting and memorable music
 'ijaajat' ne box offis par jabardast kamyaabi hasil kii or bataur vyapaarik actor naseer kaa rutaba or bad gaya
 By giving superhit films like 'tridev', by the 90s, Nasir had made a distinct identity in commercial films too
 2003 main ai hollywood film 'da lig of extra ordinary jentalmen' main nasiruddin ne captain nimo kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa to duusari taraf pakistani film 'khuda ke liye' main bhi unhone shandaar kaam kiya
 From the country to the foreign countries, Naseeruddin Shah has proved his performance in the whole world
 lekin naseer apni kaabiliyat ko khushkismati kaa naam dete hai
 He says, "I consider myself lucky that i get so many opportunities, but i am not satisfied with commercial films right now
" ' In 2008, 'A Wednesday' offered another look at Naseer's amazing performance, while films like 'ishqiya', 'politics', 'saat Khoon Maaf' and 'dirty Picture' proved Naseeruddin again and again
 That age cannot bind a true artist
 haal hi main relies hui film 'maximum' main bhi naseer kii joardaar acting ne darshakon kaa khub manoranjan kiya he
 Talking about today's Naseeruddin Shah, there is hardly any role that does not fit on him
 aakhir wo actor hi aise hai ki har role ke mutabik khud ko dhaal lete hai
 But there was a time when Naseer had a desire to do two rolls which he did not get at that time
 lekin baad 'mirza gaalib', doordarshan dharawahik main unhen do role mili jisamen unhone gaalib kaa vaastavik chitra ubhaarne kii koshish kii
 But you will be surprised to know that Nasir's desire to become Ghalib was stuck in his heart like an incomplete dream
 1988 main serial banane se saalon pehle gulzaar sahab gaalib par ek film bananaa chaahate the or us film main gaalib ke taur par unki dili ichha sanjeev kumaar ko lene kii thi
 Narrating about this, Nasir said, 'I wrote a letter to Gulzar Bhai and sent my photographs, i wrote what you are doing, in this film you should take me
 ' lekin sanjeev kumaar ko dil kaa daura pad gaya tha or sehat unka saath nahin de rahi thi
 Then after that, Amitabh's name was considered for that role in Gulzar saheb's heart
 lekin vahaan bhi baat nahin bani or aakhirkaar gaalib par film banane kaa plan hi thande baste main pad gaya
 Perhaps at that time, even Gulzar would not know that fate has written the name of someone else on this character
 kai saal baad gulzaar sahab ne ek din naseer ko phone lagaaya
 Naseer said, 'one day i got a call from Gulzar Bhai that you will work in serial
 maine poocha koun sa serial to unhone bataaya gaalib par he
 i immediately said yes without thinking anything
 ' In 1982, eighteen years after the release of 'gandhi', Kamal Haasan produced 'hey Ram', which also fulfilled Nasir's desire to become Gandhi
 sadhi hui adakari or bejod andaaj se unhone naa keval gandhi ke kirdaar main jaan daal di
 Naseer, who played all kinds of characters with unmatched acting and amazing ability, also left his mark in negative roles
 samanaantar cinema kaa ye hero commercial filmon main ek khataranaak villen ke taur par bhi hameshaa yaad kiya jaataa rahegaa
 Villain was the new face in Hindi cinema, not a punk with a ferocious and peculiar appearance, but a couchstated person with only poison in his mind
 villen kaa ye kirdaar jitna sanjeeda tha usase bhi zyada sanjidagi se use nibhaayaa tha nasiruddin shah ne
 By the way, he did not have two films as a villain
 'mohara' main unhone dikhaaya villen kaa wo cheharaa jo kisi ke bhi dil main khauf paidaa kar saktaa he
 a hunter pretending to be blind, but this was not Nasir's true identity
 naseer kii asli pahchaan samanaantar cinema tha
 The stream of cinema in which there is less for a star and more for the actor
 or ye baat kisi se chuphi nahin ki naseer ek actor pehle or star baad main hai
 The Parallel Cinema star gave art films a new identity with expert artists like Smita Patil, Shabana Azmi, Amrish Puri and Om Puri
 'nishanth' jaisi sensetive film se abhinay kaa safar shuru karne vaale naseer ne 'aakrosh', 'sparsh', 'mirch masala', 'bhavani bhavai', 'ardhsaty', 'mandi' or 'chakra' jaisi filmon main abhinay kii nai misaal pesh kar di
 Naseeruddin Shah was born on 20 July 1950 in Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh
 nasiruddin shah ne aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay se snaatak kii padhai puri kii or phir unhone neshnal skool of drama main daakhila liya
 After being duly trained in acting from this prestigious institute of acting, he became active in theater and Hindi films
 nasiruddin shah kii filmon kii suchi main samanaantar or mukhya dhara kii filmon kaa anoothaa sammilan dekhne ko miltaa he
 Your brother Lieutenant General Zameer Uddin Shah is the Chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University
 nasiruddin shah ne apane kariyar kii shuruyaat film nishanth se kii thi jisamen unke saath smita patil or shabana azmi jaisi abhinetriyaan thim
 'nishant' was an art film
 yah film kamai ke hisaab se to peeche rahi par film main nasiruddin shah ke abhinay kii sabane saraahna kii
 After this, Naseeruddin Shah has made many art films like Aakrosh, 'sparsh', 'mirch Masala', 'why Albert Pints get angry', 'mandi', 'mohan Joshi Hazir Ho', 'ardh Satya', 'katha' etc
 Why? art filmon ke saath vah vyapaarik filmon main bhi sakriy rahe
 By doing commercial films like 'innocent', 'karma', 'ijazat', 'jalwa', 'hero Hiralal', 'ghulami', 'tridev', 'vishwatma', 'mohra', Sarfarosh, he proved that he was just art
 Not only can you do commercial films too
 nasiruddin shah ke filmi safar main ek vakt aisa bhi aayaa jab unhone masala hindi filmon main apni upasthiti darj karaane main koi hichak nahin dikhaayi
 With time, Naseeruddin Shah again began to be vigilant in the selection of films
 baad main ve kam magar, acchhee filmon main apni upasthiti darj karaane lage
 Naseeruddin Shah has also directed a film
 haal hi main vah “ishkia”, “raajnneeti” or “jindagi naa milegi dubaara” jaisi filmon main apane abhinay kaa jaadu bikher chuke hai
 2013 jon de Living part siddharth Deol girl in yelo boots Dirty picture zindagi na milegi dobaaraa Nasiruddin Shah has been awarded the Padma Shri in 1987 and the Padma Bhushan in 2003
 1979 main film ‘sparsh’ or 1984 main film ‘paar’ ke liye unhen sarvshereshth abhinayta kaa rashtriya puraskaar mila
 In 2006, Naseeruddin Shah received the National Award for Best Actor for the film 'iqbal'

 467 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 467 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered a collective year based on the Julian calendar

 In India, there are many famous Panchagas like Vikram Samvat which begins 57 or 58 years before the birth of Jesus
 iske alaava shaq samvath bhi prasiddh he
 Shaka Samvat is the ancient era of India which begins 78 years after the birth of Jesus
 shaq samvath bharat kaa rashtriya calendar he
 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows- uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 467 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate he
 a meaningful change of what is said or written in one language in another language is called translation
 anuwaad kaa kaary bahut puraane samay se hota aayaa he
 In Sanskrit, the word 'translation' has been used in many contexts such as repetition, re-statement, statement used for support, frequency by the disciple
 sanskrit ke ’vad‘ dhaatu se ’anuwaad‘ shabd kaa nirmaan hua he
 'vad' means to speak
 ’vad‘ dhaatu main 'a' pratyay jod dene par bhavvaachak sangya main iskaa parivartit rup he 'vaad' jiskaa arth he- 'kehane kii kriya' yaa 'kahi hui baat'
 The word 'translation' is formed by adding the prefix 'anu' to 'ism', which means to say the received statement again
 iskaa prayog pehali baar monier williams ne angreji shabd tansleshan ke paryaay ke rup main kiya
 Only then, the word 'translation' was used to refer to the re-presentation of material presented by someone in one language into another
 vastav main anuwaad bhashaa ke indradhanushi rup kii pahchaan kaa samarthatam maarg he
 The imperative of translation cannot be avoided by making noise of the prosperity of a language and neither can it be denied the multicolon utility of translation
 jt
 Six jpvch ke paryyswaroop ’anuwaad‘ shabd kaa sweekrut arth he, ek bhashaa kii vichaar saamagree ko duusari bhashaa main pahunchnaa
 There is also a practice of 'ultha' in Hindi for translation
 angreji main TRANSLATION ke saath hi TRANSCRIPTION kaa prachlan bhi he, jise hindi main 'lipyantaran' kaha jaataa he
 The difference between translation and transliteration is clear from this example - isse spasht he ki 'anuwaad' main hindi vaakya ko angreji main prastut kiya gaya he jabaki lipyantaran main nagari lipi main likhi gayi baat ko maatr roman lipi main rakh diya gaya he
 'bhashaparan' and 'metamorphosis' have also been used for translation
 lekin ab in donon hi shabdon ke nae arth or upyog prachlit hai
 The use of 'bilingual' and 'metamorphosis' is synonymous with the term INTERPRETATION in English, which means establishing linguistic contact between two people
 kannadabhashi vyakti or asamiyabhaashi vyakti ke bich kii bhashik duuri ko bhashaantaran ke dwaara hi dur kiya jaataa he
 These days, the term 'metamorphosis' is often used to represent the creation of one genre in another genre
 jais, premachand ke upanyaas 'godaan' kaa roopantaran 'hori' naatak ke rup main kiya gaya he
 Translation is the submission of ideas expressed in one language in another language
 is vishesh arth main hi 'anuwaad' shabd kaa abhipraay sunishchit he
 The language from which translation is done is the native language or source language
 usase jis nai bhashaa main anuwaad karnaa he, vah 'prastut bhashaa' yaa 'lakshya bhashaa' he
 In this way, translation is the translation of the sentiment or idea presented in the source language into the target language without any change
 ja a good translator is one who- anuwaad asaadhaaran rup se kathin or ahvaahanaatmak kaary mana jaataa he
 It is a complex, artificial, need-generating, and visually creative process that requires extraordinary and exceptional talent
 yah isaki apni prakruti he
 But it is believed that due to lack of original writing, translation does not get a place of honor
 kyonki is baat kii avganana hoti he ki anuwaad isiilie kathin he ki vah moulik lekhan nahin-pehle kahi gai baat ko hi dubaara kahana hota he, jisamen anek niyantranon or bandhanon kaa paalan karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Thus, the importance of translation was reduced due to being non-formal, but for this reason the controls and restrictions required for it were not considered important
 is sambandh main srujansheel lekhakon ke vichaaron kii praayah charchaa hoti rahi he
 Some ideas are as follows: sampoorn anuwaad kaary keval ek asamadhey samasya kaa samaadhaan khojane ke liye kiya gaya prayaas maatr he
 The translation of a work increases its faults and squares its virtues
 kala kii ek vidha ke rup main anuwaad kabhi safal nahin ho sakate
 Translators are deceptive
 aise vichaaron ke udbhav ke peeche tatkaaleen paristhitiyaan tathaa unase prerit dharanaayen maani jaati hai
 Earlier, most of the translation material were literary works, whose translation could not meet the expectations of the reader due to limitations of the literary nature of the works
 saath hi yah bhi dharna thi ki rachana kii bhashaa ke prayek ansh kaa anuwaad apekshit he, jisase mul samvednaa kaa koi ansh chat na paae, or kyonki yah sambhav nahin, atah anuwaad ko pravanchana kii koti main rakh diya gaya tha
 This situation largely lasted until the first half of the nineteenth century in which translation was more driven primarily by personal interest, less driven by social need
 iske atirikt moulik lekhan kii parimangat prachurtaa ke kaaran bhi is prakaar kii raay bani
 After the split of imperialism after the second world war, many small and big nations became independent and the question of their identity became important
 sangheey ganraajyon ke ghatak bhi apni asmita ke vishay main sachet hone lage
 In this state of contact-establishment and identity-development, the language has a central place, which appears as a state of multilingualism
 isamen anuwaad kii satta avashyambhavi he
 As a result, translation has primarily become a social necessity
 vividh prakaar ke lekhanon ke anuwaad hone lage
 Translation work became a business
 anuvaadakon ko prashikshit karne ke abhikaran sthapit ho gaye, jinamein alpakaaleen or purnsatreey paathyakramon or kaaryshaalaaon aadi kaa aayojan kiya jane laga
 It also resulted in the change of social attitude towards translation on the one hand and on the other hand, the development of translation theory from the cognitive point of view received special emphasis and the need for translation theory was accepted for translation training courses
 falswaroop, anuwaad siddhanth ek apekshaakrit swatantra gyaanshakha ban gaya, jisaki jaankaree anuvadak, anuwaad shikshak, or anuwaad sameekshak, teenon ke liye upadey hua
 Theoretical discussion about translation originated in the modern era itself, understanding it as being contrary to both fact and logic
 anuwaad kaary kii lambi parampara ko dekhte hue yah maananaa tarksangat ban gaya ki anuwaad kaary ke vishay main saiddhanthik charchaa kii parampara bhi puraani he
 In the writings of Cicero in the first century BCE, the seeds of translation thinking are received and thereafter scholars have been expressing their views on this subject
 is chintan kii prishthbhumi bhi avashya rahi he, yadhyapi use spasht rup se paribhaashit nahin kiya gaya
 It is definitely believed that just as the translation work is organized in modern form, the development of relatively well-defined background of translation theory is also due to modern era
 anuwaad siddhanth ke aadhunik sandarbh kii mul visheshta he isaki bahupaksheeyata
 It is not based on an integrated background, but based on the coordinated background of many but interrelated scriptures, whose background is made up of relevant parts
 mukhya shaastra hai - paath sanket vigyaan, sampreshan siddhanth, bhashaa prayog siddhanth, or tulanaatmak anuprayukt bhashavigyaan
 It is also pertinent to clarify that due to the practical importance of human translation and mechanical translation on the one hand, and written translation and oral translation on the other, the thinking about their theoretical side has started
 tathaapi maanavkrut likhit madhyam ke anuwaad kii hi parimangat tathaa gunatmak pradhanta maani jaati rahi he tathaa inase sambandhit saiddhanthik chintan ke mudde vishesh rup se praasangik hai
 Although the tradition of translation thought in ancient Indian tradition is not as organized and as written, as in the West, however, the seeds of translation thought are available
 tadnusaar, anuwaad punarukti he - ek bhashaa main vyanjit sandesh ko duusari bhashaa main punah kahana
 This approach towards translation seems to be different from the accepted notion in the western tradition
 parantu is drushti ko apnaane se anuwaad sambandhi anek saiddhanthik binduon kii adhik vishad tathaa sangat vyakhya kii gai he
 In this regard, the second point of view is dialectics
 jo aadhunik he tathaa mukhya rup se sanrachnawad kii dein he
 It is clear from looking at the tradition of translation work that the thinking of the theory of Anavad has become more about literary works
 yah sthiti sangat bhi he
 In the past era, only literary works were selected for translation
 ab bhi saahitiyik kritiyon ke hi anuwaad adhik pariman main hote hai
 However, translation of non-literary writings has also started to occur in greater quantity due to the request of circumstances
 vishesh baat yah he ki donon kotiyon ke lekhanon main ek moolbhoot antar he
 Which can be expressed more clearly in the terminology of subjectivity and individualism of the writer
 vyaktinishth lekhan kaa, apni prakruti kii visheshta se, kuch apana hi sandarbh he
 Having said this, we are not denying the common background of both, but in the context presented, we want to specifically highlight the distance and relative autonomy of both
 yah uchit hi he ki bhashaprayog ke paksh se nirvaiyaktik lekhan ke anuwaad ke saiddhanthik sandarbh ko bhi vishesh rup se ubhaara jaae
 An evolutionary dimension of translation theory is the tendency to research
 anuwaad siddhanth kii bahuvidyaparak prakruti ke kaaran vibhinn kshetron ke visheshgy-bhashavigyaani, samajashastri, manovigyaani, shikshavid, nritatvvigyaani, soochna siddhanth visheshgy-paraspar sahyog ke saath anuwaad ke saiddhanthik ansho par shodhakarya main ruchi lene lage
 The field of translation work increased
 alag-alag samskritiyon ke logon main sampark badha - log videshon main shiksha ke liye jate, vyapaarik-audyogic sanghathan vibhinn deshon main kaam karte, vibhinn bhashaa bhashi log sammelnon main ek saath baithkar vimarsh karte, rashtron ke madhya rajanyik anubandh hone lage
 In all these there was an urgent need for translation and specific problems of translation began to emerge
 in samasyaon kaa adhyayan anuwaad sambandhi anusandhan kaa urvar kshetra bana
 On the one hand, new thinking emerged on the basis of the evidence presented by translation on the relation between language and culture on the one hand and language and thought on the other
 mashin anuwaad tathaa maukhik anuwaad ke kshetron main nai-nai sambhaavnaayen saamne aane lagi, jisane in kshetron main anuwaad anusandhan ko gati pradaan kii
 The new areas of language study also inspired the experts to think innovatively on the traditional fields of human translation and written translation
 in sab pravritiyon se anawaad siddhanth ko pratishtha kaa pad milane laga or ise saiddhanthik shodh ke ek upyukt kshetra ke rup main sweekruti praapt hone lagi
 The first meaningful attempt at translation was made by HH Wilson in 1855 through the 'glory of Judicial and Revenue Terms'
 san 1961 main rajbhasha vidhaayi ayog kii sthapana hui
 Its task was to prepare an All India Standard Law Terminology
 1970 main vidhi shabdaawalee kaa prakaashan hua
 It is growing
 iskaa naveen sanskaran 1984 main niklaa
 This commission has translated many texts related to law
 kai nyaayalayon main nyaayadhish hindi main bhi nirnay dene lage he
 The tradition of translation is very old
 bebal ke minar kii katha prasiddh hi he, jo is tathy kii ore sanket karti he ki, maanav samaaj main anek bhashaayen boli jaati hai
 It can be logically inferred that translation behavior may have originated much earlier due to the social imperative of mutual contact
 parantu jahaan tak likhit pramaanon kaa sambandh he, At a larger level, translation happens only if two different linguistic communities maintain long-term contact and as part of an effort to balance it, people of under-developed culture enrich their literature by translating the literature of well-developed people
 greek se latin main or arabi se europea bhashaaon main prachar anuwaad isi pravriti ke parinaam maane jate hai
 The translation work is divided into two parts - ancient and modern in terms of trends in history
 pracheen yug main mukhyatah teen prakaar kii rachnaaon ke anuwaad praapt hote hai
 Because in these three areas, books were often composed
 wein kshetra hai - sahitya, darshan or dharm
 Among the literary works, Iliad and Odesi in Greek, Ramayana in Sanskrit and Mahabharata are such texts which were widely translated
 darshanik rachanaaon main plato ke samvaad, anuwaad kii drushti se lokapriy hue
 Most translations of the Bible are found in religious writings
 aadhunik yug main anuwaad ke madhyam se pracheen yug ke ye mahaan granth ab vibhinn bhashaa bhashiyon ko uplabdh hone lage hai
 The specialty of these translations in terms of translation techniques is that, in the ancient era, these translations were exclusively unilateral, ie the language in which the translations were made did not translate any of their works into the original text
 iskaa kaaran yah ki mul granthon kii tulana main lakshyabhasha ke granth praayah utane utkrisht nahin hote the, duusari baat yah ki mul grathon kii bhashaa ke prati atyant aadar bhaavana ke kaaran lakshya bhashaa ke rup main prayog main laana sambhavtah anuchit samajha jaataa tha
 The field of translation has expanded in the modern era
 uparyukt teen ke atiri vigyaan, praudyogiki, chikitsashastra, prashasan, kootneeti, vidhi, jansampark tathaa anya anek kshetron ke granthon or rachanaaon kaa anawaad bhi hone laga he
 The translations of the modern era tend to be bilateral in comparison to the translations of the ancient era
 aadhunik yug main anuwaad kaa aarthik or raajnneetik mahatva bhi pratishthit ho gaya he
 Bilingual texts of the form of political, economic and cultural agreements between different nations are prepared
 bahurashtriya sansthaaon ko ek se adhik bhashaaon kaa prayog karnaa padataa he
 In the United Nations, every work is done in five or six languages
 in sab main anivaary rup se anuwaad kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 There is also a justification for this situation
 aadhunik yug main hui audyogic, praudyogic, aarthik or raajnneetik kranti ke falswaroop vishwa ke rashtron main ek-duusare ke nikat sampark kii aavashyaktaa kii chetana kaa ativ sheeghra vikaas hua, uske kaaran anuwaad ko yah mahatva milanaa swaabhaavik mana jaataa he
 This is the reason that if the personal interest of the translator was more than the motivational power of the ancient era, then the socio-economic-political need of translation has emerged as a strong driving force in the modern era
 is sthiti ke anek udhaaharan milte hai
 The writings of writers of linguistic minorities are translated and read more in other languages
 apekshaakrit chote tathaa bahubhashi rashtron ko apane desh ke bheetar hi vibhinn bhashabhashi samudaayon ke madhya sampark sthapit karne kii samasya kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Due to this importance of translation according to social need, translation work is now seen to be organized in an organized manner
 raajnneetik-aarthik kaarnon se utpann aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye anuwaad ab ek vyavsaay ban chukaa he tathaa vyaktigat hone ke saath-saath uskaa sanghathanaatmak rup bhi pratishthit hota dikhataa he
 In educational institutions, arrangements are made to teach translation skills and training institutes also work independently
 ek vishisht prakaar ke bhashik vyapaar ke rup main anuwaad, bhartiya parampara kii drushti se, koi nai baat nahin
 In fact, the word 'translation' and the linguistic business available from it have been in Indian tradition long back
 atah 'anuwaad' shabd or iske angreji paryaay ‘transleshan' ke vyutpattimulak or pravritimulak arthon kii sahaayta se anuwaad kii paribhaasha or uske swaroop ko shreshthatar rup se janaa ja saktaa he
 The etymological meaning of 'translation' is - re-statement; Say something once said again
