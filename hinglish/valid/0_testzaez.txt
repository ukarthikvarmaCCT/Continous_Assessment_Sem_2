 He was born in the Hindi language
 yadhyapi ye pratibha main bihari, bhushan, matiram aadi samakaleen kaviyon se kam nahin varan kuch badhkar hi siddh hote hai, phir bhi inkaa kisi ek vishisht rajdurbar se sambandh na hone ke kaaran inaki waisi khyaati or prasiddhi nahin hui
 Among the writers who have made Dev highly famous, Mishrabandhu is whose idea that Dev's place in Hindi literature comes after Tulsi
 dev or bihari main koun adhik shreshth he isko lekar ek vivaad bhi chalaa tha
 In this connection, the book 'dev and Bihari' was written by Pandit Krishnabihari Mishra and 'bihari and Dev' was written by Lala Bhagwadin

 Although six-seven poets named 'dev' are found under Hindi literature, other than the famous poet Dev, other poets named 'dev' did not get any special fame
 prasiddh dev kavi kaa janm san
 1730 main hua tha
 These Dyusaria Kanyakubj Dwivedi were Brahmins
 inkaa nivasasthaan itawa tha, jaisaa 'bhavvilas' kii nimnlikhit pankti se spasht hota he- His birth anniversary is also confirmed on the basis of 'bhavavilas', which he composed in Samvat 1746
 vah doha is prakaar he- Dev did his creations by staying at several shelters
 inaki rachana 'ashtyam' aurangzeb ke putr aajamshah ke sanket par hui thi or usne unhen puraskrit bhi kiya tha
 Perhaps 'bhavavilas' is also written in the shelter of Azam Shah
 dev ke duusare ashrayadata dadripati raja seetaram ke bhattije bhavanidutt vaisya the
 These Charkhi were residents of Dadri
 inke liye inhone 'bhavanivilas' naamak granth likhaa
 Dev's third refuge was Kushal Singh
 ye faphund ke rahanevaale the or dev ne inke liye 'kushalvilas' naamak granth kii rachana kii
 Dev's real qualities - customers and refugees were Raja Bhogilal, for whom he composed a book called 'rasavilas'
 inke sambandh main dev ne apane rasvilas main likhaa he- Dev's work 'premchandrika' is dedicated to Udyot Singh, son of Rao Mardansingh of Dyondia Khede
 'sujanvinod' kii rachana dilli ke rais pathiram ke putr sujanmani ke liye hui
 His final work 'sukhsagar Tarang' was written in the shelter of Ali Akbar Khan, the King of Pihani
 dev kii bahusankhyak rachanaaon kaa ullekh kiya jaataa he
 Some say the number of his texts is 72 and some people 52
 parantu inke pramanik granth, jo praapt hote hai, 18 hai
 The other nine texts are also mentioned by his name and thus a total of 27 texts match his name
 nirvivaad rup se jin 18 granthon ko devkrut sweekaar kiya ja saktaa he ve is prakaar hai- Handwritten texts are - devkrut ek sanskrit granth bhi 'shrangar vilasini' naam se bharatpur se prakashit hua tha
 Its theme is also Shringar and heroine, and Hindi verses have been composed in Sanskrit language in this book
 yadhyapi isaki rachana shuddh sanskrit main he, phir bhi dev kii vaastavik pratibha ke darshan isamen nahin hote
 To conclude from these majority texts of Dev that all texts are different from each other is misleading
 inke ek granth ke anek chand duusare granthon main milte hai or praaia: inhone apane kisi purvavarti granth ko ashrayadata kaa naam badalakar doosraa naam de diya he
 Most of Deva's narrative themes are love and adornment, but his perception of love and adornment is extremely high and his spirit is expressed in a sublime and bright form
 dev kaa kavyashastreey vivechan bhi, jo inke granthon main lakshan anshon main praapt hota he, apni moulik visheshta rakhata he
 But much of Dev's fame is contained in examples, not in his traits
 dev ke savaiya or ghanaakshari donon hi apni chhap rakhte hai or dev kii sundar rachanaaon ko kisi duusare kavi kii rachanaaon se milakar chipa rakhana sambhav na hoga
 The more extensive experience one gets in the compositions of Dev, the deeper the emotionality is also gained
 kisi bhi bhav kaa dev jaisaa sajiv or marmasparshi varnan asaadhaaran vastu he
 The imagination of God does not only possess an oratory characteristic, but he is fed with the feeling of sensation and gets plucked
 isi prakaar dev kii shabdaawalee bhi apni he
 The musical flowing vocabulary in Dev's vocabulary makes the verses effortlessly memorable and Dev has had unequaled success in portraying form, beauty, object, character
 dev apni inhen visheshtaon ke kaaran hindi sahitya main atyant utkrisht sthaan ke adhikari hue hai, yadhyapi samasamyik rajya sammaan inhen vaisaa praapt nahin hua tha jaisaa inhen milanaa chahie tha

 At the age of nine, he went to study in a school called 'liki Kandarchhet' near his home
 18 varsh kii umr tak vahaan usne vigyaan, ganit or sahitya kaa adhyayan kar 'bachalar' kii oopaadhi praapt kii
 Signs of his talent started appearing from here
 vidhyalay chhodane ke varsh usne ganit pratiyogita main bhaag lekar, kisi samasya kaa itnaa acha hal diya tha ki uske adhyapakon ne use 'enles da mathemetik' main prakashit kiya
 On leaving the said school, he joined the 'ecole Normal Superior' for higher level studies
 sahitya or vigyaan main samaan ruchi ke kaaran, vahaan usne darshan vishay liya
 This allowed him to receive education from three eminent philosophers of France

 Zino gives the same place to stability

 yaheen se henry bergasaan kaa maathaa thanka or usne darshan tathaa vigyaan kaa gahan adhyayan jari rakhane kaa sankalp kiya
 In line with this determination, after finishing the education of 'ecole Normale', he went to 'licky Angers' as a teacher, where he stayed for two years
 phir 'clairmant' main adhyapankaarya karne chalaa gaya
 Now his thoughts were maturing and the students of 'claremont' were very impressed by his comprehension and succinct lectures

 It was here that he made it clear that he was not merely a philosopher within the ambit of the classroom, while editing Lucretius's treatise, presenting proper views on the relationship of poetry and philosophy in the role

 His above article, in the form of a treatise, was published in 1896
 1910 main 'time and free vil' naam se prakashit pustak isi kaa anuwaad he
 From this book, the vision of Bergsan appeared in front of the curious and general readers
 usne anekta, sattakal tathaa chetana ke do do pahalu prastut kiye
 In general, plurality appears to be numerical, but Bergsan stated that the plurality of internal experiences can be qualitative rather than numerical or quantitative
 isi prakaar, sattakal athwa vah samay jisamen ghatnaayen ghatit hoti hai niravyav, athwa ekares maaloom hota he, kintu vah savyav he
 The reason for the seeming immateriality is intelligence, which looks at the dissolved ingredients separately
 chetana kii vyakhya karte hue usne kaha ki vah chetana, jo pruthak avasthaaon main vibhajit rahati he, satahi chetana he
 True consciousness remains below that

 The publication of the said book attracted the attention of the then thinkers to Henry Bergson
 unhen laga ki kaant ke baad, vah darshan kii moulik samasyaon par ek naveen drushti daalane ja rahaa tha
 As a result of this effect, in 1898 he got a place in 'ecole Normale'
 usee varsh, 'maitiyar et memvir' prakashit kar usne apni niyukti ko uchit siddh kiya
 This book of Bergsan was published in English in 1911 under the name 'matter and Memory'
 isamen smritidosho ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par, usne 'man or padaarth' ke dwait kii samasya saral karne kaa praytn kiya
 This was a profound problem of modern philosophy
 rine da karte se lekar emanuel kaant tak sabhi darshanik maathapai karte chale aa rahe the, kintu vivaad kaa ant kaant ke is kathan se hua tha ki man or padaarth, athwa prakruti main gyaata-gyey sambandh he, kintu man buddhi ke dwaara jaanata he or buddhi ke jaanane ke kuch bandhe hue tareeke hai
 Therefore, she squid her undetectable objects
 isse vyavhaar or parmarth kaa bhed baraabar bana rahata he
 Bergsan partially accepted Kant's view
 usne yah mana ki buddhi aantarik satya ko desh main rakhkar hi jaanati he
 She inspects the objects from all around and calculates their various aspects, one by one
 gyaan kii yah vidhi paryaapt nahin he, kyonki prakruti kaa satya sthir nahin, pravahamaan satya he
 It is a constant change, which reveals innovations every minute
 prakruti nirjeev padaarth nahin, vah jivan se otprot he
 The substance is the lava which the bursting life force throws out
 prakruti kaa saar yahi jeevanshkti he, jo ek nirantarata he
 a shallow study of memory proves the difference between past and present, but a subtle study shows that memory presents only those parts of past which are necessary for present action
 sampurna satya kaa gyaan antardrushti se hota he, jo jivan kii dhara kii hi bhanti pravahamaan anubhav he, aparokshanubhuti he, sahanubhuthaik gyaan he
 The reputation of Bergsan increased

 Conclusion Even though it is not new, the book is very interesting, abundant examples of living animals bring the book very close to the human mind

 Suddenly, in 1932, the book 'les deux Sourses the la Morel at the La Releason' was published and it was then discovered that the silent seeker was considering the problems of religion and morality

 Burgesson would have stayed away from the french-jewish problem because, according to his honor, the government was willing to relax its policy towards him
 kintu bergasaan ne atyaachaariyon kaa saath dene ke bajaay utpeediton main rahanaa pasand kiya
 In 1940, when the 'vishi' government ordered the Jews to abdicate, Bergsan also broke his nominal relationship with the 'college the France'
 phir usee varsh, disbar main, jab yahudiyon ko apane naam panjikrut karaane kaa aadesh diya gaya, to vah bhi, ek saadhaaran yahudee kii bhanti, registration aphis ke saamne kai ghante tak apni pari aane kii pratiksha karata rahaa

 Such as Prithvirajaraso in poetry, Samyukrita, Prithvirajavijaya epic in Tilottama and Surjancharitmahakaavya in Kantimati prithvirajraso kavy main or surajncharit mahakavy main spashtollekh he ki, sanyogita jayachand kii putree thi
 The great part of Prithvirajvijay's epic is Kshatiyukta
 parantu vahaan bhi ganga nadi ke tat par viksit kisi gram main sanyogita kaa janm hua tha ye ullekha prapya he
 Historians believe that Kannauj was definitely that city
 sanyogita jab yauvan ko praapt hui, us samay sampoorn bharat main prithviraj kii veerta kii charchaayen ho rahi thi
 When Sanyogita heard the story of Prithviraj's valor, she got tied up in Prithviraj's love loop
 premshastra main asi kanyaon ko mugdha kaha gaya he
 When Jaichand came to know about the heartfelt love of Mugdha Sanyogita, he set out to marry his daughter with another king
 kyonki jayachand or prithviraj ke madhya sambandh vaimnasypurna the
 After that Jayachand conducted Ashwamedhayagya
 us yajna ke ant main sanyogita ke swayamvar kii bhi ghoshnaa kar di
 On the occasion of Swayamvar, he invited all the kings of the whole of India but did not invite Prithviraj
 prithviraj kii is prakaar apmaan karne par bhi jayachand santusht nahin hua
 Therefore, he made an idol of Prithviraj with iron and installed it in place of the gatekeeper
 parantu swayamvar ke samay sanyogita ne prithviraj kii murti ko hi varmala pahanaai
 When Sanyogita at the gate was wearing the statue of Prithviraj at the same time, Prithviraj entered the kingdom
 prithviraj ne sanyogita ko ashv ke upar bithaaya or dehali chale gayi
 Once, King Prithviraj was in the garden of Ajmeru's palace, at the same time Pratihari was present there
 pratihaari ne raja ko kaha, "he rajan ! kanyakubj se ai ek mahila aap se milanaa chaahati hai"
 After this, Pratihari presented the woman in front of the king after getting the king's signal
 raja ko pranaam kar mahila boli, "he rajan ! kanyakubj ke swami jayachand kii sanyogita namika kanya he
 How can i describe her beauty? Brahma has composed Kamadeva as the siddhi from the essence of all the verses
 sanyogita ke rachana ke samay brahm dwaara jo vastuen ekatrit kii gai, un vastuon se hi amrit, chandramaa, kumud or camel rachana hui"
 Pausing a little, the woman further said, "O Hindusharestha! If Kamadeva chants in an Amritasamudra, then Lakshmi: i can hardly compare the beauty of coincidence with those beautiful Lakshmi"

 The marriage proposal made by Kanya creates an irony
 atah he sakhi ! mere dushprapya manorath par aashaa ke ankur kii kalpana bhi nahin he" aisa bol kar sanyogita moorchhit ho gai
 After that, conscious effort, she said, "you go to Shakambhari
" meri hridayasthiti ko samrat ke sammukh upasthaapit karo
 If they don't come for my salvation, then i will drown in the Ganges "
 paricharika kaa nivedan sun kar samrat ne pratyuttar diya ki, "us mriganayani kaa manorath purna hua hi samajho
 Tell him that i will soon come to Kanyakubj to protect him "
 uske pashchaat paricharika kaa yogya aatithy karke use waapas bhej diya
 Immediately he himself walked towards Kanyakubj with his nobles
 prithviraj ne jab kanyakubj pravesh kiya, tab vah chhadmaveshi the
 Because he wanted to see every genre of Kanyakubja
 atah prithviraj chaaran ke vesh main nagar main yahan vahaan bhraman karne lage
 Prithviraj saw the gates of the city of Kanyakubja, the palace, the huge buildings, the quadrangle and the gardens
 evam kanyakubj nagar main bhraman karte hue unhone nagar ke vishay main suchnaayen ekatra kar lee
 According to the Surajncharit epic, Prithviraj went to Indrapastha, taking coincidence in the night itself
 anya granthon main sanyogitaaharan kaa jo ullekh miltaa he, us se yah kinchit bhinn ullekh surjancharit mahakavy main praapt hota he
 Some scholars are of the opinion that, "there is no mention of coincidence anywhere in Jayachand's inscriptions
" evam uske astitv ke bhi koi pramaan na hone se vah ek kaalpanik paatr maani jaati hai"
 Among scholars who question the subject of being a historical character of Sanyogita, Dr
 Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha is counted
 dow ojha kaa mat he ki, jayachand ke shilalekhon main yaa tamrapatron main kahin bhi sanyogita kaa varnan nahin he or rambhamanjarimahakavy main or hammirmahakavy main sanyogita kaa ullekh praapt nahin hota he
 Therefore, it was the imagination of any bhat of the sixteenth century which is a character of coincidence
 anya itihasvidon kaa kathan he ki, rambhamanjarimahakavy main or hammirmahakavy main sanyogita kaa varnan nahin he ojha-mahoday ne kaha
 But there is no mention of Prithviraj's marriages in those texts

 The rejection of leaving Catholicism and swearing allegiance to William III in the Revolution of 1668 led to the wrath of the Drydeg state and all its posts and pensions were stripped
 uskaa dahaanth 1700 ke may diwas par gathiya rog se hua or westomister abe main use dafnaaya gaya
 Dryden's first contribution to English poetry was a poem he composed in 1649 in memory of his classmate Young Lord Hastiges
 us samay vah keval 18 varsh kaa tha
 This poem is written following the method of spiritual poems of Dun and Cleveland
 kintu 1659 main prakashit kramwel kii mrityu par rachit uske heroik stejon main pravaah kii kuch kami hote hue bhi saahitiyik saushthav he
 His restorative commendatory poems, which begin with 'astrea Redux' in 1660 and end with 'annus Mirabilis' in 1667, demonstrate his unprecedented and surprising hegemony over the poetry genre
 kuch aswabhaavik chitron tathaa anaavashyak alankrita shabd vinyas ke hote hue bhi ennas mirabilis apni shashakt dhwani, kavyochit abhivyakti evam sangitatmak gunon ke kaaran ek vilakshan kriti he
 Dryden was busy with theatrical composition for many years
 usne swayan sweekaar kiya he ki is prakaar kii rachanaaon ko vah ghrunit samajhataa tha or keval aarthik laabh ke liye vah waisi rachana karata tha
 Between 1663 and 1694, Dryden composed all seven comedies, five heroic plays, four triumphal comedies and four tragadic compositions, including his first comedy The Wild Gallant and his final play Love Tempent
 ukt kritiyon main, heroik kapalats main likhaa hua pramukh naatak conswest ov grenada, sarvaadhik ullaspurn kamedi marriage-e-laa mod tukyukt kapalate main likhit uski antim tragdi aurangzeb, blancovers main nirmit uskaa pratham or sarvshereshth naatak aal for lav, tathaa usee padhyapaddati par rachit uski don sivastian naamak tragdi uski shreshth rachanaayen hai
 Don Sivastian can be placed on par with his best-known drama All for Love, but it is even better in terms of plot depth and composition
 yadhyapi naatak ke kshetra main dryden ne nihsandeh mahatvapurn kaary kiya kintu uski purna sarjanaatmak shakti uske 50wein varsh main prakashit granth avsaalam and ekitafail main prasphutit hui jo apane tikshn buddhi vilaas, jajvalyamaan shabdayojna, praharatmak akshep evam vyangatmak chithran ke liye ek adbhut rachana he or angreji bhashaa main sabase mahaan raajnneetik vyangyakavy he
 After this, 'the Medal' was published in 1682, which is a direct attack on the democratic policy
 taduparant usee varsh mike 'flepanon prakaash' main aayaa, jo angreji bhashaa ke vyaktipradhan vyangakaavyon main apana sheershasth sthaan rakhata he
 In it, 'the Medal of John Weyes', composed by Tomas Shedwell, is a powerful and bitter answer to the allegations made by the husband of his book The Medal
 'heroik kapalats' se vilsit vyangakavy main niojit kavy-katha kaa yah pratham udhaaharan he or pope ke 'dunsiod' kaa sanket prastut karata he
 It was only in 1682 that the Religiolaiso was published in which the firm support of the Protestant Church of England and against theism is presented clearly and sharply
 'di hind and di panther' jisamen dryden ke catholic dharm kii ore parivartit vichaardhaara kaa nyyochit nideshan he, dryden kaa suprasiddh dharmik ghoshnaptr he or apni spashtataa, tarkpaddati evam nishkapatata ke liye isaki adhik khyaati he
 It is the quintessential religious satire in the English language
 adwitiya dakshata or jwalanth shakti se ot prot akshep, uttejnaa or tak kii uddeshypurti ke liye in sabhi kavitaaon kii rachana tukamukt heroik kapalate main hi hui he
 Dryden's poetry is a neglect of lyrical elements

 His 'odds to the Pius Menary of Mrs
 Any Killigrew', 'A Song for St
 Cecilia's Day' and 'alexander's Feast' have been decent and flowy

 Ilit has written, Dryden has contributed to the creation and growth of the English language by his translated and original works

 Although these stories are written in Dryden's old age, ill-health and adversity, he is counted among the best storytellers in the English verse
 dryden kii gadhyrachana main mukhyat: uske niabandh or bhoomikaaye hai jo kavy or naatay sambandhi vividh samasyaon se sambandhit hai
 This first great English critic is one of the founders of modern English prose

 Essay of Dramatic Poetry is Dryden's high-quality criticism of the play

 From the beginning to the end, this book is full of such places that express the author's uncommon merit and his subtle observation of literary evaluation

 Steam distillation is a special type of distillation process by which heat sensing substances such as natural aromatic compounds are isolated
 bahut se carbonic yogic nirantar ucch taapmaana par vighatit ho jate hai, inkaa pruthakkaran saamaanya aswan dwaara nahin ho saktaa he, isliye aswan upkaran me pani yaa bhaap bheji jaati he
 By adding water or steam, the boiling point of the compounds drops down, which results in it evaporating at a lower temperature, preferably at a temperature below which the substance degrades greatly
 yadi wo padaarth jinka aswan hona he ushma ke prati bahut adhik samvedansheel hote hai to, bhaap aswan ko nirvaat aswan ke saath sanyukt rup se kiya ja saktaa he

 mahapurana jain dharm se sambandhit do bhinn prakaar ke kavy granthon kaa naam he, jinamein se ek kii rachana sanskrit main hui he tathaa duusare kii apbhransh main
 The first half of the 'mahapuran' composed in Sanskrit is Acharya Jinsen and the late author Acharya Gunabhadra
 apbhransh main rachit brihat granth 'mahapurana' ke rachayita mahakavi pushpadant hai
 The main name accepted in the Pushpika of this Maha Granth is Trishtilakshanmahapuranasangraha and the upper name is 'mahapuran'
 iske aadi bhaag ke rachayita acharya jinsen tathaa uttar bhaag ke rachayita acharya jinsen ke shishy acharya gunbhadra hai
 Jinsen Swami started the Maha Purana with the desire to write the character of all the 63 Shalaka men, but his desire could not be fulfilled due to his being in the middle and the Maha Purana remained incomplete, which was completed by his disciple Gunabhadra after his death
 
 mahapurana ke do bhaag hai, ek adipurana or doosraa uttarpurana
 The Adipuran has the character of Adinath or Rishabhdev, the first Tirthankara and the remaining 23 Tirthankaras and other Shalaka men in Uttar Purana
 adipurana main baarah hajaar shloke tathaa 47 parv yaa adhyay hai
 Of these, 42 festivals are complete and 3 verses of 43rd festival are composed by Acharya Jinsen and 1620 verses of the remaining four festivals are composed by his disciple Acharya Gunabhadra
 is tarah adipurana ke 10,380 shlokon ke rachayita acharya jinsen hai
 The Adipurana is considered the best of the Prathamanu Yoga texts of Jainagam
 vividh vishyon kaa apane dhang se vivechan karne ke atirikt acharya jinsen ne apane se purvavarti siddhsen, samantabhadra, sridatt, yashobhadra, prabhachandra, shivakoti aadi solah vidwaanon kaa bhi ullekh kiya he
 Apart from this, details of the states of Sukoshal, Avanti, Pundra, Kuru, Kashi etc

 In this, 23 Tirthankaras starting from Ajitnath, 11 Chakravarti, 9 Balabhadra, 9 Narayana, 9 Pratinarayana and specific men in their time are given the plot
 in vishisht kathankon main kitne hi kathanak itane rochak dhang se likhe gayi hai ki unhen prarambh karne par puraa kiye bina bich main chhodane kii ichha nahin hoti
 Although the character of the Tirthankaras is very briefly written except for the eighth, sixteenth, twenty-seventh, twenty-third and twenty-fourth Tirthankaras, the briefness of the style of narration is also not distasteful
 is granth main na keval puranic kathanak hi he kintu kuch aisi sthal bhi hai jinamein siddhant kii drushti se samyak darshan aadi kaa or darshanik drushti se srishtikartrutv aadi vishyon kaa bhi acha vivechan hua he

 Jayakantan's specialty is that he has managed to present his sophisticated story in a sophisticated manner by assimilating the merits of his predecessors
 jayakaantan ke pachaas ke dashak main, jab tamil kahani ke praangan main padaarpan kiya, sahitya-jagat sankatpurna ghadi main guzar rahaa tha
 The empire of great magazines, claiming a large readership, was established and creative genius was covered with this mist
 ye vyavsaayik patrikas tathaa kathith janaruchi kii aad lete hue vigyapanbaaji kii hode main saste manoranjan kii saamagree chhapane lageen
 As a result, true litterateurs preferred to leave these papers and write in small magazines

 By the next decade, commercial papers decimated small-magazines

 One similarity found between Akhilan and Jayakantan is that the two never compromised their self-esteem while writing in professional journals
 jayakaantan is vishay main ek kadam aage hi rahe
 The commercial journals in which his stories were printed stood on the stage and roared with sattvik fury against him
 vamapanthi vichaardhaara kii patrika main jis samasya par likhte, usee ko or adhik tikhe shabdon main vyavsaayik patr main likhane kaa saahas unamem he
 To understand the continuity of Jayakantan's dominance in Tamil fiction, a discussion of the history of his later era is necessary
 sundar ramswami jayakaantan ke samakaleen hai
 In the words of critic Venkata Swaminathan, "both the storytellers were rich in self-study and influenced by leftist ideology in early writing
" ab vamapanthi siddhanth ke saath unki pahchaan nahin kii jaati, aise main unki samanta yaheen samaapt ho jaati he
 Sundar Ramaswamy's works are more refined with palatable humor; But he writes only occasionally
 jayakaantan mukhar, gambheer or aakraamak tevar ke lekhak hai jo prachur maatra main likhte hai
 In the decades of sixties and seventies, Jayakantan was considered as Savyasachi among Tamil writers

 Recently, his son Antipholus of Syracuse who is now grown up and Dromio of Syracuse, his son's servant, leave Syracuse to find his brothers
 siracus kaa antifolus waapas nahin lautataa he to igon uski khoj main nikal padataa he
 The Duke of Ephesus, Solinus is moved by hearing this story and gives Egon a day's time to pay the fine
 usee din, apane bhai ko khojane ke liye siracus kaa antifolus affisus aata he
 He sends Dromio of Syracuse to deposit some money in the centaur

 Inside the house, Antipholus of Syracuse feels that he is quite attracted to his "wife "'s sister Luciana, he tells her" Hey dear mermaid don't let me get you by my attention / I'm so drowned in your sister's tears
 " Have been
 " He is happy to hear her, but is worried about their moral impact
 jab vah baahar nikalati he, to siracus kaa dromeo ghoshnaa karata he ki usne pataa laga liya he ki uski ek patni he, jiskaa naam nail he or vah khaanaa pakaane kaa kaam karti he
 He says "he is chubby like a globe; i can find many countries in his buttocks: i discovered him from a marsh"
 He says that he has discovered America and the Indies, "they are adorned with rubies, garnet, sapphires, all over his nose and which are perishing in the hot breath of Spain; and which to explode on his nose Send a stock of firecrackers " yah america ke liye shakespeare dwaara die gaye maatr kuch sandarbhon main se ek he
 Syracuse decides to leave as quickly as possible and Dromio goes to prepare for the trip
 antifolus ko angelo naamak ek sunar pakad letaa he, jo daawa karata he ki usne apane liye ek chen banavaane kaa order diya tha
 Antipholus is forced to accept the chain and Angelo says that he will return for payment

 He refuses to take the chain and is immediately arrested
 jab use le jaaya ja rahaa tha to siracuj kaa dromeo aata he, jise vah apni jamaanat ke paise lene ke liye adriana ke ghar bhej detaa he
 After completing this task, Dromio of Syracuse accidentally gives the money to Antipholus of Syracuse

 tab adriana ke ghar se ek sandeshvahak daudta hua aata he or kahata he ki ephisiens ne apane bandhan khol liye hai or pinch ke bahut peeta he

 islam main masjid ke liye keval sthaan vishesh hoti he magar iske vaastushilp par kadagan nahin
 Initially the mosque was constructed from the roof of pillars and addresses of the stems of Nabvi dates
 kaaba pattharon se bani ek chaukor imaarat thi jiske aasapaas khule parisar main puja hoti thi
 But over time, Muslims went to study resources and built mosques according to their needs and the culture of the region
 masjidon main mahange kaam or buland minar or gumbad baad main bananaa shuru hue
 The reason for the tower was that the mosque was visible from a distance, the azan di sound came on it and there was a glimpse of the culture and art of the area
 gumbad se masjid vaktaa ke bhaashan or prarthana kii awaz ek gunj or saundarya ke saath puri masjid main faili thi

 Some gunpots have mirrors that allow light to enter

 The courtyard of BBC Khanam, the mosque built by Amir Timor in Samarkand, is also included in the list of large tolerances
 jamiya aalazehar or misr hi ek masjid haakim ke angan bahut bade hai
 Purpose This list is too long

 musalmaan allaah se atoot prem karata he, is ko prakat karne kii jagah masjid he
 For centuries, mosques have been the hallmark of Quran imports and other sculptures
 kyonki islam jivit vastuon kii tasviren banane ke liye protsaahit nahin karata isliye masjidon kii araish anya maapdand istemaal kiye gaye
 Dark colors are used for sculpting in mosques, including feroze, dark blue, golden and red

 Going because it was America before Islam spread to Turkey

 masjid main saafe vastra pahan kar aana chahie
 The women came wearing such clothes from which i am a curtain
 isi tarah purush uchit vastra pahan kar aae
 Generally, Muslims consider wearing Arabic clothes in addition to regional clothes and it is good and pleasant, but there is no such applause on clothes in Islam, but the clothes should be according to the principles of Islam
 praarambhik islam se purushon or mahilaon donon masjidon main aane kii anumati he lekin unhen alag jagah di jaati he
 According to Shari Islam, during the prayer, the cleansing of women lags behind men so that men do not lose sight of women
 paigambar sa alaihi va ke daur main purush or aurat donon masjid main namaaz adaa karte the haalanki mahilaon ke sammaan or suraksha ke liye behatar mana jaataa he ki vah ghar main namaaz adaa karen
 Nowadays mosques often have a separate place for women
 upmahadweep, paak or bhartiya mahilaon ke masjid main aane kaa rivaaj na ke baraabar he lekin yah islam se nahin balki bhartiya samaaj se he
 Women from Arab countries and modern Western countries visit mosques, offer prayers and participate in various educational activities
