 During the reign of Ravana, the splendor of Lanka was at its peak and he had made his palace a completely golden king, so his Lankanagari is also called the city of gold or the city of gold
 padmapurana, shrimadbhagwat puraana, kurmpurana, ramayana, mahabharat, anand ramayana, dashavatharcharit aadi granthon main ravan kaa ullekh hua he
 Different texts are mentioned in different texts about the rise of Ravana
 valmiki dwaara likhit ramayana mahakavy ke anusaar ravan lankapuri kaa sabase shaktishaalee raja tha
 Who was Ravan? Dev and the demons are half-brothers among themselves and are constantly quarreling
 Maharishi Kashyap's wife Aditi was born to Dev and Diti was born as a monster
 As a result of the wrong teachings of Diti and in the race to further their offspring from Aditi's sons, the demons went in the wrong direction and became staunch enemies of the gods
 They fought for ages, sometimes the demons were sometimes heavy
 donon dev or daanav tapasya karte the, daan punya aadi shreshth karm karte the kabhi brahma ji se to kabhi mahadev se var praapt karte the or phir ek hi kaam ek duusare ko nicha dikhaanaa
 nirantar ladai jhagade se devtaa dukhi ho gayi tab devataaon ne brahma ji se prarthana kii, ki wo kuch karen
 brahma ji ne devataaon ko sagar manthan kii baat kah or usase amrit praapt hone kii baat batalaai jise devtaa pi len, to wo daanvon ke haath mrityu ko praapt nahin honge or yah saath main yah bhi kaha ki sagar manthan aasaan nahin he usamen daanvon ko bhi shaamil karo or yukti purvak amrit ko praapt karo daanvon ko sammilit karne ke kaaran hai ek to itnaa bada kaam akele or gupt tareeke se kar nahin sakoge, kyunki daanvon ko pataa chal jayega doosraa isamen shram bahut lagegaa
 brahma ji kii baat par tab yukti purvak devataaon ne daanvon ko sagar manthan milakar karne kii baat ke liye raji kiya or daanvon ko sagar se bahut se ratna nikalne kii baat kahi, lekin amrit kii baat nahin batalaai
 daanav sahamat ho gayi or phir unhone kaha bhai pehle hi is baat ko tay kar lo ki pehla ratna niklaa to koun legaa doosraa kiskaa hoga, taaki baad main vaad vivaad na ho
 devtaa thode ghabaraaye ki, kahin pehali baar main amrit nikal gaya or daanvon ke haath laga gaya to? lekin phir bhagwaan ko man hi man namaskara kar unhone vishwaas kiya ki bhagwaan unka kalyaan avashya karange or tay ho gaya ki pehla ratna nikalegaa wo daanvon ko doosraa devataaon ko or phir isi prakaar se kram chalata rahegaa
 manthan ke liye rassi kaa kaam karne ke liye devataaon ne sarpon ke raja vasuki se prarthana kii or use bhi ratnon main bhaag dene kii baat kahi gai, vasuki nahin mana, usne kaha ki ratna lekar wo kya karegaa? phir devataaon ne alag se use samajhaayaa or amrit main hissaa dene ki baat kahi tab wo taiyaar hua
 sumeru parvat se prarthana kii gai usko ko mathni banane ke liye manaaya gaya
 sab taiyaari purna hone ke baad tay kiye maapdandon par niyat din main sagar manthan hua, lekin jaise hi madaranchal parvat ko samudr main ootara gaya wo apane bhaar ke bal se sidhaa sagar kii gaharaaiyon main dub gaya or apana ghamand pradarshit kiya, tab asuron main banasur itnaa shaktishaalee tha, usne madaranchal parvat ko akele hi apni ek hajaar bhujaaon main uthaa liya or sagar se baahar le aayaa or madaranchal kaa abhimaan nasht ho gaya
 dev or daanvon ke prakram se khush ho or brahma ji kii prarthana par, bhagwaan shri narayan ne kachhp avatar liya or parvat ko apni peeth par rakhaa
 sagar manthan shuru hua sagar manthan or dev daanvon kaa prakram dekhne swayan brahma, vishnu, mahesh, sapt rishi, aadi apane-apane sthaan par baith gaye
 sagar manthan shuru hone ke bahut dinon ke baad sabase pehle halaahal vish niklaa, jiske jehar se dev daanav or teenon lokon ke praani, vanaspati aadi moorchhit hone lage tab devataaon ne bhagwaan se prarthana kii or shri vishnu ne kaha isse rudra hi bachaa sakate hai
 tab bhagwaan rudra ne wo jehar pi liya lekin gale se neeche nahin utarne diya
 halaahal vish se unka kanth nila ho gaya or uske baad se hi ve devadhidev mahadev kehalaae or galaa nila pads jane ke kaaran nilkanth naam se jane or puuje gayi
 pun: manthan shuru hua, bhagwaan shankar ke mastak par vish ke prabhaav se garmi hone lagi tab manthan ke samay hi chandramaa ne apane ek ansh se sagar main pravesh kiya or saath main sheetaltaa liye hue bal rup main prakat hua or mahadev kii seva main upastith hua
 bhagwaan shiv uske is bhakthi par bhav par bahut khus huye or use hameshaa ke liye apane mastak par bal chandra ke rup main sheetaltaa pradaan karne ke liye sushobhit kar diya
 phir ratna rup main kamdhenu gaay nikali or daanvon ke bhaag kii thi, jise unhone bina gun bichaare sochaa ki gaay kaa ham kya karange or us gaay ko saptrushiyon ko daan main de diya ab baari thi devataaon kii lekin ratna main prakat hui mahalakshmi
 devataaon or daanvon ne unki stuti kii or sagar ne apane ek ansh se prukat hokar mahalakshmi ji ko bhagwaan vishnu ko kanyadan kiya or wo shri vishnu ke vam bhaag main virajman ho gai
 phir airavat hathi devataaon ke bhaag main aayaa iske baad kaustubh mani or anya ratna nikle
 or jab daanvon ke bhaag main uccheshrava naamak ghoda aayaa jo veda mantron se bhagwaan kii stuti karne laga tab daanvon ne abhimaan purvak devataaon ko de diya bole rakh lo, veda bolne vaala tumhaare hi kaam aayega hamen isaki zarurat nahin he
 phir madiraa nikali wo daanvon ke bhaag kii thi or wo use paa ke or pi ke wo bahut prasann ho gayi
 daanav madiraa paan se bahut aanandit ho gayi the or jab nasha thoda kam hua to pun: manthan shuru kiya iske baad devataaon kii baari thi or amrit kalash ke saath bhagwaan ke anshavatar shri dhanvantari avatarit hue
 lekin daanvon ko laga shaayad isamen bhi madiraa ho to wo balpurvak us kalash ko lene kii koshis karne lage
 badhate jhagade ko nipataane ke liye shri narayan ne pun: samudr se hi mohini rup main anshavatar liya
 sabhi dev or daanvon ne mohini ko ratnarupi devi jaanakar pranaam kiya tab mohini ne kaha ki, aap log jhagada kyun kar rahe hai? or jab kaaran janaa to usne kaha ki aap logon dwaara hi tay niyamanusaar yah kalash to vaise devataaon ko milanaa chaiye, lekin phir bhi yadi tum chaaho to main aap sabhi main kalash ke dravya ko baant kar aapkaa vivaad samaapt kar detii hoon, devtaa samaj gayi ki bhagwaan hai or unki sahaayta ke liye aae hai at: sabane mohini ke mithe vachanon ko maan liya
 mohini ne sabhi ko kaha ki wo pankti main baith jaaen, tab dev daanvon ko alag pankti main baitaakar kalash ke dravya ko jo amrit tha par daanav use madiraa samaj rahe the
 mohini ne kaha devataaon kii pankti se armbh karongi, cunki aap log ek baar dravya kaa paan kar hi chuke ho or yah kah kar devataaon ko baantna shuru kiya
 daanvon main ek ko nasha kuch kam sa ho gaya to wo phir se madiraa pine kii chahat main chupake se devataaon kii pankti main antim sthaan par baith gaya or use bhi amrit mil gaya
 surya or chandramaa ne is baat kii shikaayat bhagwaan vishnu se kar di tab unhonen us daanav par chhal karne kaa dand dene ke liye chakra se prahaar kar diya or us daanav kaa sar katate hi bhagadad much gai lekin wo daanav amrit paan ke baad bhi jivit rahaa
 What happened to all the demons? Why it happened How did it happen? The chariot of Shri Hari was to tell the demons that this demon had cheated drunkenly by deceit, when the siren was distributing, he should have patience, and after drinking the nectar, the gods have become more powerful than the demons
 : Now, do not quarrel with the gods due to demon envy
 The demon who changed the way to drink Amrit was wrong because on the basis of the set standards, the nectar was right on the nectar, but even then Mohini was distributing the nectar to everyone from one side of the line
 The demons now came to know that there is no alcohol in the urn but there is nectar, then some demon came forward in an attempt to snatch the urn from the siren Mohini, giving the remaining nectar urn to Devraj Indra and said that you people should settle among themselves
 Here, the demon who drank the nectar was living under the name of Rahu and Khadu Ketu and later he was revered as the shadow planet
 amrit prapti ke baad varshon tak devataaon kaa palada baari rahaa or wo daanvon par baari pads gayi
 is bich devataaon ne pun: tapabal se shakti arjeet kii tab daanav pareshaan ho gayi or unhone apane guru se poocha ki, guruvar ham kaise devataaon ko haraa sakate he tab unke guru ne kaha devtaa amrit paan kar chuke hai unhen haraana bahut kathin he, or ek hi upaay he agar shreshth brahman kaa tejasvi putr aapako sahaayta kare to devataaon ko haraaya ja saktaa he
 oopaay jaan kar daanvon ne sochaa brahman putr bhala hamaara kaam kyun karegaa, uske liye hamaara saath dena uskaa adharm hoga or is kaary ke liye koi bhi tejasvi to kya prithvi lok kaa saadhaaran brahman bhi taiyaar nahin hoga
 agar ham balpurvak kuch karange to shreshth or tejasvi brahman hamaara hi vinaash kar daalega or kamjor brahman ke paas ham gayi to, devtaa bhi hansee karange or hamaari keerti ko bhi dhabba lagegaa
 manthan or chintan ke daur shuru hue daanvon ke or ve sab ek nirnay par pahunche ki agar ham apni kanya kaa daan kisi shreshth brahman ko den to, brahman ko avashya sweekaar karnaa hi padega kyunki brahman shreshth maryaada kaa paalan karne ko baadhya he uskaa putr hoga, wo hamaara bhaanja hoga or brahman bhi, use ham paalange kshiksha deeksha denge, hamaare anusaar chalegaa or jab marji devataaon se bhida denge
 tab ek daanav bolaa kanya daan vaali baat thik he par daan kaise doge? ye reeti to ham daanvon kii he nahin, brahman kanyadan kaise or kyun sweekaar karegaa
 devataaon vaale rivaaj ham kar nahin sakate, kyunki wo hamaare anukul nahin rahe hai
 anya daanvon ne kaha baat to sahi he or nirnay ko soch samaj kar ke lene ke liye meating ko duusare din tak ke liye taal diya
 raat ko ek daanav apane ghar main bahut pareshaan or udhedbun main tha ki is baat kaa hal kaise diya jaae
 wo apane parivaar main baitha tha uski patni or putree ne chintaa kaa kaaran poocha, tab usne unako baat batalaai
 uski putree kaa naam tha keshini usne kaha pita ji daanav kanya kaa vivaah shreshth brahman ke saath isaki aap chintaa naa karen, main shreshth brahman vishrava ko jaanati hoon jo aryaavrut pradesh ke paas ke jangal main hi apane shishyon ke saath ashram main rahete hai
 ve apane shishyon ko bahut sayanm or shanti ke saath adhyayan karaate hai, maine unako dekha he unka gyaan bhi bahut shreshth he, aisa mujhe lagata he kyunki main kai baar chup chup ke unako sun chuki hoon
 agar pitaaji aapaki aagyaan ho to main unke paas jaaongi or unase prarthana karuungi ki wo mujhe apni patni ke rup main sweekaar karen
 mujhe purna vishwaas he ve mujhe avashya apanaayenge, main unke swabhaav se parichit hoon
 putree keshini kii baat sun, uske mata pita bahut prasann hue, pita ne apni putree ko kaha ki putree tu is daanav kul kii raksha or bhalaai ke liye sochaa, tu bhaagyashaalee or dhanya he, kal main sabhi se is bare main charchaa karunga or tab tumhen apana nirnay dungaa
 duusare din keshini ke pita ne anya sabhi daanvon ko apni putree keshini dwaara diya gaya suzav batalaaya or sabhi bahut khush hue keshini ko aagyaan de di gai
 keshini apane kaary main safal rahi
 shaktishaalee daanav kii putree hone ke baad bhi usne namrata purvak apane mata pita kii chintaa dur karne kaa prayaas kiya or brahma ji ke maanas putr, maharishi pulasthya ke putr vishrava ne unhen apni patni ke rup main ashram main sweekaar kar liya
 ek acchhee patni ke rup main keshini apane pati kii kai varshon tak bahut seva kii or ek din uske pati rishi vishrava ne prasann ho kar keshini se var maangane ko kaha
 keshini ne adbhut or tejasvi putron kii maan hone kaa vardaan maanga, jo devataaon ko bhi parajeet karne kii takat rakhata ho
 keshini ne ek putree, patni or maan ke rup me apni maryaada kaa paalan karne main purnrup se safal rahi
 apane mata pita kii chintaa ko dur hi nahin kiya apitu uske baad pati seva kaa tap bhi kiya samay aane par usne ek adbhut balak ko janm diya jo das sir or bees haathon vaala atyant tejasvi or bahut sundar balak tha
 Keshini asked the sage, he has been born with so much hands and head, the sage said that you had asked for a wonderful son, so wonderful, that no one else is like this, exactly the same son has been born
 On the eleventh day, his father performed the wonderful boy's Namakarna rite and named it Ravana
 Ravana grew up in his father's ashram and later became his two brothers Kumbhakarna and Vibhishan and a very beautiful sister Surpanakha
 Sayong of Ravan's birth was made in this way
 purvakaal kii baat he vaikunth lok main jai-vijay naamak do dwarpal the
 ek baar unhone shaunkadi balak rishiyon ko vaikunth main jane se roak diya tha, unhen laga ki baalkon ko bhala bhagwaan ke paas kya kaam he
 tab shaunkadi rishiyon main se ek balak rishi ne jai vijay ko shraap de diya ki tum donon ne vaikunth lok main mrityulok jaisaa niyam kaa paalan kiya or swayan shri hari ke dwaar par seva main rahete huye itnaa gyaan bhi nahin he at: tum mrityulok ko praapt ho jaaoge
 dusre balak rishi ne kaha tumhen is baat kaa bhaan bhi nahin ki shri vishnu lok main yah parampara nahin ho sakati
 isi bich aawaaj sun kar swayan bhagwaan vishnu un shaunkadi rishiyon ko lene aa gayi
 unhone tathaa jai-vijay ne rishiyon se kshamaa maangi
 is par rishiyon ne kaha ki shraap waapas nahin ho saktaa, samay aane par tumhen mrityulok janaa hi hoga, par jaise swayan shri hari hamen lene aaye he vaise hi wo tumhen bhi waapas vaikunth lok laane ke liye mrityulok main aayenge
 dusraa kaaran yah tha ki ek baar naradji ko apni bhakthi par abhimaan aa gaya or wo har lok main ja ja ke apni bhakthi or tapasya kaa bakhaan karte the
 naarad ne apane pita brahmadev ko batalaaya tab unhone kaha ne naarad apni bhakthi kaa bakhaan mat karnaa yah acha nahin he
 naarad kailash main gayi or vahaan bholenath ko bataaya unhone bhi kaha naarad aap har jagah is baat ko kah rahe ho acha nahin he
 lekin naarad abhimaan main the ki samast lokon main un jaisaa koi narayan bhakt nahin he
 kailash se lautate huye naarad vaikunth kii ore chale tab naarad ke abhimaan ko nasht karne ke liye bhagwaan vishnu ne ek maaya nagari kaa nirmaan kiya
 naarad jahaan se nikle tab maarg main unhen ek sundar nagar dikhaai diya
 naarad ne sochaa main sabhi lokon or nagar main gaya hoon par yah is nagar main nahin gaya at: yahan ja ke dekhtaa hoon koun sa nagar he
 naarad vahaan pahunche, bahut sundar nagar tha indrlok se bhi sundar vahaan ke raja ne naradji kaa sammaan kiya, mahal main baithaaya or swayan sapariwaar naarad ji ko namaskara kiya
 jalpan aadi ke baad kaha, maharishi aap to chirinjivi, trikaaldarshee mahatma hai meri putree kaa swayanvar do dinon ke baad rakhaa he vaise to maine samast teenon lokon main khulaa aamantran diya he ki jise bhi meri putree chaahegi usee se vivaah kiya jaayegaa parantu yadi aap mujhe bataa den ki damaad kaisaa hoga to mujhe aatm santosh ho jaayegaa
 naarad ji ne unki putree ke hastrekha dekh kar kaha ki aapaki putree bahut bhaagyashaalee he, ise chirinjivi, ajar amar, sundar or shatoguni pradhan var milegaa
 jisaki keerti samast lokon main ho or naarad ji us kanya ke rup ko dekh kar mohit ho gayi unhen apane aap main bhi wo sab gun najar aaye jo uski hastrekha bataa rahi thi
 iske baad naarad ji ne bidaa lee or vaikunth lok ko apni bhakthi kaa bakhaan karne nikal padhe
 raste main vichaar kiya kii mujh me saare gun he lekin main sanyasi hoon
 ab mujhe bhi saptarishiyon kii tarah apni grahasthi basaa leni chaiye
 vivaah ke liye abhi jis kanya ko dekha wo upyukt he
 lekin ek kami he wo he meraa rup par uski chintaa kii koi baat nahin kyunki main bhagwaan kaa bhakt hoon or abhi ja ke bhagwaan vishnu se unka rup maang lunga or unhen apane bhakt ko dena hi padega
 naarad thode samay baad vaikunth pahunche bhagwaan ne swaagat kiya poocha bahut jaldi main ho kya baat he
 naarad ne kaha bhagwan ese hi bahut din ho gayi aap se mili huye, bhagwaan bholenath se milakar aa rahaa hoon or ab aap se milane chalaa aayaa
 ab vaise bhi mere paas samay he kyunki tapasya or bhakthi maarg kii ucch avasthaa bhi praapt kar lee he, gyankand, karmkand or bhakthi main bhi ab main charam seemaa par pahunch chukaa hoon
 maaya ko bhi jeet chukaa hoon ab soch rahaa hoon main bhi grahasthi ban jaaon
 raste main ek kanya ko dekh kar aa rahaa hoon jo sabhi gunon se yukt he aapse kya kahun bhagwan aap to sarvajna hai or main to aapkaa sab se bada bhakt bhi hoon at: aap meri sahaayta kijiye
 bhagwaan ne muskuraate huye kaha naarad tum grahastha banane kii chaah main lagata he kanya ke sundar rup par rogagrastha ho gayi ho at: main avashya tumhaare is rog ko dur kar dunga tum chintaa mat karo
 tum mere sabase bade bhakt ho to mujhe bhi ek chikitsak kii tarah se hi apane bhakt ke rog ko dur karnaa hoga
 naarad bhagwaan ke in vaakyon ko nahin samaj paye or bole prabhu meraa rog dur karne kaa upaay he aap mujhe apana hi rup de dijiye taaki main sundarataa main bilkul aap jaisaa hi dikhu taaki wo kanya mujhe varan kar le
 bhagwaan ne kaha naarad main tumhaara chikitsak hoon isaliye main rog ko thik karunga tum chintaa mat karo
 naarad ne kaha prabhu mujhe aagyaan dijiye ab main chalata hoon
 naarad ji khush the kii ab wo bhi bhagwaan vishnu jaise hi ho gayi hai or swayamvar ke din pahunche
 vahaan teenon lok se bahutse log aaye the, raja ne sabhi ko baithne ko asana diye
 naarad ji ne anumaan lagaaya pichhali baar raja ne mujhe maharishi kah kar charan dhoye par, aaj sirf saamaanya tareeke se pranaam karke asana diya, iskaa matlab bhagwaan ne mujhe apana rup de diya tabhi to ye raja aaj mujhe nahin pahchaan sakaa
 swayanvar armbh hua kanya apane liye var kaa chayan karne ke liye ek taraf se aage badhi or naarad ji ek do baar apni jagah se khadey huye kanya kaa dhyaan apni taraf aakarshith karne ke liye or jaise hi wo paas se nikali to naarad ji apni gardan ko aage kii taraf jhukaa ke khadey ho gayi
 lekin kanya aage batch gai or ek anya divya purush ke gale main jayamala daal di
 kanya kaa vivaah unase sanmpann hua vivaah ke baad do shiv gana jo vahaan aaye the, wo naarad ji ko dekh kar bole aap kyun baar–baar uchhal rahe the
 naarad ko unki baat par bahut gussa aayaa or bole moorkho hans kyun rahe ho jaanate nahin main koun hoon? wo ye to pataa nahin koun ho par dekhne par lagate ekadam bandar ho, wo bandar jo mrityulok par paye jate hai
 naarad ne apana munh jal main dekha to vanar kaa sa munh kaa najar aayaa
 shiv gana phir bole kyun lag rahe ho naa mrityulok ke bandar or pun: jor se hansen to naarad ji ko or adhik krodh aa gaya or unhen shraap de diya ki tum donon shiv gana ho kailash main rahete ho or meraa uphaas karte ho, naarad kaa uphaas karke kehete ho mrityulok kaa bandar isaliye tumhen shraap detaa hoon tum mrityulok main jaaoge or wo bhi rakshas kul main, or phir bandar hi tumko peetenge
 iske baad naarad ji gusse se vaikunth lok kii ore teji se bade, unhen bhagwaan vishnu par bahut gussa aa rahaa tha
 On the way, the same girl and groom were also going after marriage
 As soon as Narada crossed the wedding procession, the groom asked, "where did Narada go?" Narada got angry with this question and said a little wait, Oh you are now i have recognized you
 You are Lord Vishnu
 i also told you about this girl with such a big game, i told you about this girl's qualities and she cheated me only after listening to me, and changed her form and married another girl
 After this Narada ji cursed Shri Hari as well, i curse you as i am in disconnection of my wife, you will also be unhappy with the separation of your wife, that too in the land of death, because what is the real disconnection? Will go and you will deviate from my wife just like i did
 God said Narada, cursed you, accept it and then removed my illusion, then Narada saw nothing, was that city, Neither that girl Narada said what happened? God said you had said that you have conquered Narada's illusion, that's why i was taking your test
 naarad ne shri hari se kshamaa maangi or bhagwaan vishnu adrishy ho gayi
 isi bich vahaan shiv gana bhi aaye or unhonen naarad ji se aparaadh kshamaa karne ko kaha
 naarad ne kaha shraap mithyaa to nahin hoga, at: rakshas to tum hooge hi lekin itnaa or kar detaa hoon ki tum itane prakramee rakshas hooge ki swayan bhagwaan shri hari hi tumhaare uddhaar ke liye aayenge
 Apart from this, the third yoga was Pratapbhanu who falls prey to the curse of Brahmins in greed to become the Chakravarti king, whose story will come forward, which is also related to the birth of Sitaji
 in teenon shraap se or in sabhi ke ansh ke rup main prakat hua ravan
 pratapbhanu kaa rajasi gun, shiv ganon kaa taamasi gun or jai–vijay kaa bhakthi kaa gun, in teenon vyaktiyon ke gunon kii pradhanta liye janm liya ravan ne
 balykaal main hi ravan ne chaaron veda par apni kushagra buddhi se pakad bana lee, use jyotishi kaa itnaa acha gyaan tha ki, uski ravan samhita aaj bhi jyotishi main shreshth maani jaati he
 yuvavastha main hi ravan tapasya karne nikal gaya use pataa tha ki brahma ji uske pardada hai, isaliye usne pehle unki ghor tapasya kii or kai varshon kii tapasya se prasann hoke brahma ji ne use vardaan maangane ko kaha, tab ravan ne ajar–amar hone kaa vardaan maanga
 brahma ji ne kaha main ajar amar hone kaa vardaan nahin de saktaa hoon tum gyani ho isaliye samajhane kaa prayaas karo
 main tumhen wo nahin de saktaa hoon lekin badale main anya shaktiyaan detaa hoon
 ravan tapasya se shakti praapt karke aayaa mata-pita se mila ve bahut prasann hue
 ab thoda abhimaan man main aa gaya or ek din, do chaar saathiyon ko leki ravan apni yuvavastha main sahastrabahu arjuna ke rajya kii seemaa main gaya, vahaan narmada nadi ke kinare usne dekha nadi kii chaudai bahut hone ke baad bhi usamen jal bahut kam tha
 Ravana said to his friends how the water of this river is so low, at first it used to be very full of water
 tab saathiyon ne thoda aage badhakar dekha ek band najar aayaa jisamen nadi kaa samast jal roka gaya tha or baandh ko baanon se banaaya tha
 Then the companions of Ravana told him that, by using his wonderful archery, someone has stopped the water by tying it with arrows
 They all went ahead and saw some soldiers engaged in armed security, Ravana asked who should be built and who built this dam
 Those people said that our Maharaj Sahastrabahu Arjun has come to visit this time with his wives
 Ravan said, well, now look at my skill and with one arrow he broke the dam
 Sahasrabahu's wife who went to bathe was swept away and after a lot of effort, she was evicted
 When Ravana broke the dam, his soldiers informed Sahastrabahu about this, then Sahasrabahu and Ravan got into a war and Ravana lost it, took him captive and put him in jail
 His companions ran away and Ravi's grandfather, Muni Pulastya, was told that he sent a message to Sahastrabahu Arjun that Ravana is a young man and there is a possibility of mistake in his youth, so leave him
 Arjun leaves him and warns again If there is no such mistake, then not a single head will be seen
 Ravana felt very guilty and meditated for Brahma Ji again for years
 And when Brahmadev came back, he again asked for the boon of immortality
 But this time also he did not get the boon of being immortal but gained more elusive power
 Having got elusive powers, he once roamed the region of monkeys
 It was evening, Bali, the king of the apes, was chanting evening under a tree
 He meditated for Lord Brahma
 And when Brahmadev came back, he again asked for the boon of immortality
 But this time also he did not get the boon of being immortal but gained more elusive power
 Having got elusive powers, he once roamed the region of monkeys
 It was evening, Bali, the king of the apes, was chanting evening under a tree
 He meditated for Lord Brahma
 And when Brahmadev came back, he again asked for the boon of immortality
 But this time also he did not get the boon of being immortal but gained more elusive power
 Having got elusive powers, he once roamed the region of monkeys
 It was evening, Bali, the king of the apes, was chanting evening under a tree
 ravan use dekh kar hansaa or phir use chhedne laga i mercut, i bandar bol uskaa uphaas karne laga or yuddh karne ke liye uksaane laga
 ravan ko apni mayavi shakti par ghamand aa gaya tha wo baali se kaha are mercut maine suna he tu bahut shaktishaalee he aa jaraa mujhase yudd kar ke dekh tera abhimaan main kaise dhilaa karata hoon
 lekin baali dhyaan main tha isaliye usne isaki baat ko suna hi nahin
 iske baad ravan ne usko jor se laat maari or bolaa paakhandee mere lalkaarane ke baad mere dar se dhyaan main baitha he, sidhe-sidhe bol ki main nahin lad saktaa
 baali krodh se oobal pada usne ravan ko patake-patake kar itani maar maari bas wo sirf marane se hi bachaa or phir use apni punch main band kar lapet liya, pun: sandhya vandan samaapt karke usne ravan ke garv ko chur-chur kar diya
 chha: maheene tak baali ne use apni kaid main rakhaa ek din use apane baane haath se usko apni kaankh main dabaakar baali ja rahaa tha tabhi uske haath kii pakad dhili ho gayi or ravan bhaag niklaa aisa bhaaga kii dikhaai nahin diya
 ab ravan ko pataa chalaa ki usase bhi balashaali log hai mujhe hi pitamah kii vajah se abhimaan zyada tha
 After this, he again went out to do austerity and again he asked for a boon to be immortal
 Brahma ji said that son is not that boon in my possession and this time he got tremendous powers and Brahmastra from Brahma ji
 One day the gods got angry on anything and he climbed alone in heaven and he alone defeated all the gods in a fierce battle
 Indra, Yama, Varuna took all the other Decapals and Prajapatis hostage
 All the other gods escaped from heaven, he took over the heavenly world and later returned it to the gods, but the values of the gods were dissolved
 The demons came to know that Ravana, his nephew, defeated all the gods in heaven alone
 This was revealed in the three worlds and the demons became very happy with this, their desire for years was fulfilled and the demons cheered Ravana
 And prayed to Ravana to become his king
 Due to Ravana's sharpness and her grand appearance and leadership, the Maya demon was pleased that her extremely beautiful and dignified daughter Mandodari was married to Ravana and Mandavari was pleased with Pa as Ravana's wife
 Among Pativrata women, Mandodari is equivalent to Goddess Ahilya
 Ravana became revered by the demons as the king, then he thought of building a capital for himself, he went to heaven again
 Maybe it would be fine to build the capital, all the gods Indra, Yama, Varuna fled to see him, he felt lucky Happened but he did not like heaven, while returning, he saw a beautiful city on Mount Trikuta in the sea
 He went straight there and saw that his only half-brother Kuber lives with the Yakshas
 He asked Kubera to vacate the city with Yakshas
 Kubera went to his father and said, "father Ravan is forcibly evacuating Lanka," then he said, "son Ravan is not among those who believe at this time, so you give him that place
 No one will bother you On the orders of his father, Kubera built a city named Alkapuri in the Himalayan region near Mansarovar lake and went to Lanka with wealth from the Yakshas
 Here Ravana made Lanka very beautiful on Trikutaparvat
 His father-in-law, a demon named Maya, who was extremely proficient in mysticism, made Lanka the most beautiful city among the three worlds, with gold foil and diamond jewels, all the walls of Lanka from Mania, pillars, etc
 and when When the lack of feeling felt, Ravana took it away from Kubera
 Ravana instructed all the demons to stay in Lanka and gave everyone one beautiful house and palace, Then one day the Pushpak aircraft was also snatched from Kubera
 Raising the kingdom and setting up the beautiful capital, providing all the well-being facilities to all the Asuras and securing them completely, Ravana again got into the penance of Brahmadeva, seeing him later his brother Kumbhakarna and Vibhishan also joined him in penance Agye
 Brahma ji then came to Ravana, Ravana said, "father, i want a boon of immortality
" Brahmadev said that it is not possible for me to give it, but Ravana did not believe that Brahma ji went away
 Ravana continued to meditate again and after years of intense penance, Brahma again came to Ravana and explained to him that, do not ask for a boon of immortality, you are knowledgeable, i do not have the power to change the rules of the world, i am in dignity
 i have the power to work, son, you are doing my penance again and again and i am disturbed, so i give as much as possible today
 In your navel, i provide an Amrit Kund and as long as this Amrit Kund stays in your naabhi, you will not die
 If you are not satisfied on this and want to be immortal, then it is better you go to Mahadev's shelter
 i do not know of Mahadev or whether he will give the boon of being immortal or not, but he is not under my control
 Ravana then asked Brahma ji, how long will this nectar pool remain in the navel? Then Brahma Ji said that no one can dry this nectar tank except for the fire arrow, Ravan thought it was almost immortal, because no one other than Lord Vishnu can use the fire arrow, so he told the grandfather of Brahma
 Now you are not giving a boon to be immortal, so i accept it but you have to give more
 Brahma Ji said that apart from you being immortal, i am ready to give other demands, then Ravana asked for a boon so that he could be called Dev, Danuja, Nag, Yaksha, Kinnar, Gandharva could not kill anyone in a war
 Brahma ji said Aastastu
 At the same time, the sight of Brahma ji stood on an apsara who was hiding nearby and kept his ear listening to what a boon Brahmadev was giving to Ravana
 Brahma ji understood who sent who and that apsara bowed to Brahma ji, but it was not good to see him hiding in such a way, Brahma ji did not like it, he only told that nymph so much
 Have you heard so much that, on the day a loud punch of a monkey will hit your ear, on that day, understand that Ravana and the demons have come to an end
 Area was fleeing that Ravana are captured him and who are here Kyakr said? He told that Brahmadev had come to see just what he was saying
 Ravana understood that the gods had a trick, so he said to the nymph that you have a habit of listening too much, so now walk with me, now at the gate of Lanka, if someone enters there, then listen and guard and listen to the name Lankini Put it on the main gate for guarding
 Ravana had now reached almost the peak of his austerity power, so pride was also natural
 sabhi rakshas uski chhatra chaaya main surakshit the unamem se kai rakshas wo pehle devataaon ke bhay se tapasya nahin kar paa rahe the, wo tapasya karne lage shakti praapt karne ke liye or anya sabhi rakshas lanka main anand or eshwarya kaa bhoga karne lage
 One day Ravana, on the strength of his pride and majesty, went out alone to triumph in Trilok and went to Suthal Loka
 There, King Bali was in the palace palace in the lofty lord and Ravana went to his door with great pride and roar and said to the door pal, "speak the sacrifice, Ravan has come to battle" No one else in the guise of the gatekeeper, but Narayana himself, sacrificed
 Was given a boon, that he will give guard at his door
 When Ravana forcibly threatened Dwar Pal, the gatekeeper said, "O Lankapati Ravana, Maharaj Bali is in worship at this time and after the end of the puja he must fight with you, don't worry, be patient, he is a godly devotee, so first he We will complete that work, after that, they will come here to wear their armor in front of them, then we will give your message to them right here in front of you ”
 Ravana was proud and said, "ok, i will wear this armor, i will break it now
" "ravana stepped forward and tried to lift that armor, but it was so heavy that Ravana was sweating to lift it
 Lankapati Ravana, the gatekeeper sarcastically, your forehead has been sweating in lifting the armor of our Maharaj Bali, i am doubtful how you will be able to fight Maharaj Bali is a matter of time and you should be patient
 Ravana got scared in his mind and ran away after saying that he came after, did not come back
 Ravana defeated all the Gods, Yakshas, kinnars, Gandharvas, etc
 in the battle, and killed the demons, and he used to think before the humans that what he would fight was straightforward people, so his demons on other land parts of the earth were his Were driving
 Although the powerful kingdoms, which had other kings like Ayodhya, Mithila, Kaushal, were majestic and capable kingdoms of very high koti and never fought for border expansion, these kings Sanmargi and Narayana were devotees, His subjects were also happy and of high status
 Maharaja Dasharatha was so natural that even Devraj Indra had asked him for help in the war
 King Janaka was such a great king that he did not even care for his body in the work of the people, in the interests of the people and in the service of the saint and hence his name was also called Videha
 ek se badhakar ek rishi, maharishi, muni jinamein parashuram, viswamitra, bamdev jaise log in raajaaon ke darbar main aate the or isi vajah se inke rajya ko tedi aankh dekhne kaa saahas teenon lokon main swat: hi koi nahin kar sakaa
 a question arises that Ravana was killed by Sahastrabahu Arjuna, then by Bali, then fled to Sutle Lok for fear of sacrifice, Ayodhya, Mithila, Kaushal, the territories of apes etc
 were not under him, then how did Ravana assume the trio conqueror Gone? Ravana got nectar from Brahma ji in the navel pool, due to this, his death could not be from anyone other than Lord Narayana, he knew that, he was guilty in his mind that, if immortal, then how good would it be because his goal He was the same and he was trying for that
 lekin sirf amar rahane se koi baat nahin banati he bal, kaushal or shastr bhi chaiye uske liye usne tapasya se bahut kuch paaya bhi
 us vakt ravan jaise kai anya tapasvi bhi the, raja bali, vanar pradesh kaa raja baali, banasur aadi
 ravan ne brahma ji se vardaan paane ke baad sochaa ab wo amarta kaa vardaan paane ke liye mahadev ko hi prasann kar ke rahegaa or vardaan le ke rahegaa
 ravan ne bhagwaan bhole nath kii tapasya armbh kar di, varshon tak tapasya kii, bhole nath prakat nahin huye, ravan ne sochaa bholenath jaldi prasann hone vaale mahadev hai or mujhase hi lagata he aprasann hai ye soch kar usne or kathor tapasya karnaa shuru kar diya, kabhi niraahaar rah kar to kabhi bhagwaan bholenath kii sudanr stroton se veena vaadan kar, lekin prabhu prukat nahin hue
 ravan ne sochaa uskaa jivan hi bekaar he agar wo mahadev ko prasann na kar sakaa, mahadev jo sheeghra prasann ho jate hai apane bhakton par, or main hi unako prasann na kar sakaa ye soch kar aatmaglani se bhar gaya
 ek din wo puja main jab pushp chadhaane laga to pushp kam pads gayi, tab usne puja ko purna karne ke liye usne ek-ek kar apana mastak kaat kar pushp kii jagah chadhaana shuru kar diya, ye soch ke ki jo apane jivan main mahadev ko prasann nahin kar sakaa to us jeene vaale ko dhikkaar he
 aaj pushp kii jagah mahadev ko mere sheesh arpan hai
 dard se ravan besudh sa ho gaya lekin munh se har har mahadev kahana nahin chhoda
 antim sir se jhuk kar mahadev ko antim pranaam kar jaise hi khadg prahaar kiya apni gardan par mahadev ne prakat ho uskaa haath pakad liya, bole ravan mujhe bahut prasannataa hui, tumne mere liye apane praan sankat main daal diye, maango kya chaiye
 ravan dard ko sahataa hua mahadev ke charnon main pranaam karata hua, ati vinamr hoke bolaa “he devadhidev mahadev mujhe aapke darshan ho gayi, aap mujh se prasann hai mujhe ab or kuch nahin chaiye, main maangane kii ichha se hi tap kar rahaa tha, lekin aap ke is sundar swaroop ko dekhakar hi main dhanya ho gaya, aap prasann ho gayi mujhe is baat se purna santosh he prabhu or mujhe kuch nahin chaiye, aapane mujhe darshan de diye, mere liye isse bada vardaan kuch nahin, at: mujhe kuch nahin chaiye
 mahadev ne kaha ravan main to tumhaare sankalp se hi vardaan dene ke liye aayaa hoon at: aise to ja hi nahin saktaa hoon
 at: tum ni:sankoch hoke maango, tumhen jo chaiye tum maang lo
 ravan ne kaha “he mahadev, he devadhidev, he bhaktavatsal yadi aap dena hi chaahate hai, to mujhe aapaki atut bhakthi de dijiye or main hameshaa aapke “nam: shivaay” rupi mantra kaa jap karata rahon, iske atirikt mujhe kuch bhi nahin chaiye
 mahadev uski baat sun atyant prasann huye, jiskaa laksh tha amarta praapt karnaa or wo prabhu bhakthi maang rahaa he isse badhaa gyani or koun ho saktaa he
 tab mahadev ne use apni bhakthi pradaan kii or vardaan diya ki, tumhaare sheesh pun:aa jaaenge iske alaava jab bhi koi ang cat jayega us ke sthaan par pun: nayaa ang swat: hi ug aayega
 mahadev jaanate the ki ravan ko baali or anya logon se yuddh main haar jane kii glani man main he ki wo utna shaktishaalee nahin he isaliye mahadev ne bhakthi ke atirikt use bahut apaar bal de diya or saath main pashupat naamak astr diya
 mahadev se bal paakar jab vah jaise hi apane sthaan se ootha or waapas chalane ke liye kadam aage rakhaa to to prithvi dagamagaa gai or ravan bahut aanandit ho gaya or pun: mahadev ko man main pranaam kar wo laut ke lanka main aa gaya
 mahadev kaa ravan priy bhakt ban gaya, lanka se pratidin puspak vimaan se kailash jaataa tha or vahaan bhagwaan mahadev kii puja or aradhana karata tha
 When Ravana subjugated the nine planets running all the three worlds at his own pace, and with the Digpalas, he used water spillage in his Lanka paths, he was considered as the conqueror of the Trilok, because of the operation of the Trilok
 All the gods, the nine planets were under him and now there was no one in Trilok to defeat him
 He had captured most of the parts living in the three worlds
 ek baar naarad ji phir se lanka aaye, ravan ne unki bahut acchhee seva kii, naarad ji ne ravan ko kaha “suna he mahadev se bal paae ho ravan ne kaha haan aapaki baat sahi he

 ravan ne kaha yah to nahin pataa parantu agar main chaahun to prithvi ko hilaa dula saktaa hoon

 According to the Ramayana, Ravana's father was Vishrava and the sage was the son of Pulatsya
 ravan kii mata kaikasi thi jo rakshas kul kii thi isliye ravan brahman pita or rakshasi mata kaa santan tha or ravan kai vidyaayein, veda, puraana, niti, darshanashastra, indrajaal aadi main paarangat hone ke baavjood bhi unki pravritiyaan rakshasi thi or puure sansar main aatank machaata tha
 The demons came to know that Ravana, his nephew, defeated all the gods in heaven alone
 This was revealed in the three worlds and the demons became very happy with this, their desire for years was fulfilled and the demons cheered Ravana
 And prayed to Ravana to become his king
 Due to Ravana's sharpness and his grand appearance and leadership, the Maya demon was pleased that his extremely beautiful and dignified daughter Mandodari was married to Ravana and Mandavari as Ravana's wife was pleased with Pa
 Mandodari is the equivalent of Goddess Ahilya among the patriotic women

 Other demons raised the benefit of Ravana's name, tax collection in his name, Sidd, saints and sages started being insulted
 The demons, in order to remove their hatred from the gods, they sometimes cows and Brahmins, because there are very few gods left in heaven, perhaps the gods are Brahmins and they are helping the gods to become saints by changing the form of demons
 Started giving and killing everyone
 Due to which the load on earth increased
 But Ravana did not pay attention to all these
 anek raja maharaajaaon ko parajeet karata hua dashagriv ikshvaku vansh ke raja anrany ke paas pahunchaa jo ayodhya par rajya karte the
 He also challenged them to fight duel or accept defeat

 When Anaranya's body was severely mutilated, Ravana insulted and ridiculed the Ikshvaku dynasty

 Ravana laughed at seeing him and then started teasing him, Ai mercut, Ai monkey started ridiculing him and provoked him to fight
 Ravana was proud of his elusive power, he said to the girl, Hey Mercut i have heard that you are very powerful
 Come and fight with me and see how i loosen your pride
 But Bali was in meditation, so he did not listen to it
 After this Ravana kicked him vigorously and said heresy is sitting in meditation with my fear after my defiance, speak directly that i cannot fight
 Bali was boiled with anger, he killed Ravana by beating him so much that he survived only by dying and then tied it in his tail and wrapped it again, ending Sandhya Vandan and he broke the pride of Ravana
 Six For months, Bali kept him in his captivity
 One day he was going to Bali by pressing him in his armpit with his left hand, then his hand got loose and Ravana ran away
 Now Ravan came to know that there are more powerful people than him, i had more pride due to my grandfather
 iske baad wo phir se ghor tapasya karne nikal pada or phir se usne amar hone kaa vardaan maanga

 varg: bhartiya sikhavarg: sangrur jile ke logvarg: mahila bhartiya swatantraaa kaaryakarta According to an estimate, two million people take religious bath daily in the river considered sacred by Hindus
 hindu dharm main kaha jaataa he ki yah nadi bhagwaan vishnu ke camel charnon se athwa shiv kii jataaon se bahati he
 The spiritual and religious significance of this river can be compared to the importance of the Nile for ancient Egyptians
 jabaki ganga ko pavitra mana jaataa he, vahiin paristhitiki tantra se sambandhit isaki kuch samasyaayein bhi hai
 It is filled with chemical waste, drain water and the remains of human and animal corpses and there are major health hazards by taking a direct bath in dirty water or drinking its water

 The river has an unusual ability to retain dissolved oxygen in water

 Studies done in 1983 of samples taken from the right bank of the Ganges in Patna confirm that the river Ganges, rather than water taken from wells and tube wells dug in the same area, Acherricia coli), fecal streptococci and Vibrio colliery, the Son and Gandak rivers
 Die two to three times faster in water

 According to the UECPCB study, while the level of coliform present in water should be below 50 for drinking purposes, below 500 for bathing and below 5000 for agricultural use - the current level of coliform in Ganga in Haridwar has reached 5500 
 coliform, ghulit oxigen or jaev rasinic oxigen ke str ke aadhaar par, adhyayan ne pani ko e, bi, si or di shreniyon main vibhajit kiya he
 While Category a is considered suitable for drinking, b for bathing, c for agriculture and d for high pollution levels

 According to the study, the main reason for the high level of coliform in the Ganges is the direct disposal of human feces, urine and sewage from its starting point in Gaumukh till it reaches Haridwar via Rishikesh
 haridwar tak iske maarg main padane vaale lagbhag 12 nagarpalika kasbon ke naalon se lagbhag aath karod nabbe lakh litre malajal pratidin ganga main girtaa he
 The amount of sewage falling in the river increases more when about 15 lakh people visit the Chardham Yatra every year between May and October

 shri prabhaat jha iske sampadak hai or shri sanjeev kumaar sinha sahaayak sampadak
 The Bharatiya Jana Sangh, popularly known as Jana Sangh, was founded by Dr
 Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in 1951 in support of nationalism in response to the secular politics of the dominant Congress party
 ise vyapak rup main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii raajnneetik shakha ke rup main janaa jaataa tha, jo svaichhik rup se hindu rashtravaadi sanghatan he or jiskaa uddeshy bhartiya kii "hindu" saanskrithik pahchaan ko sangrakshit karnaa or congress tathaa pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru ke muslim or pakistan ko lekar tushtikaran ko rokna tha
 The first campaign of the Jana Sangh was the movement for complete merger of Jammu and Kashmir with India

 He was arrested for violating orders, who died a few months later in jail after suffering a heart attack

 In the 1967 assembly elections in the country, the party was successful in forming a coalition government in various Hindi speaking states including Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh along with other parties including Swatantra Party and Socialists
 isse baad jansangh ne pehali baar raajnneetik karyaalay chihnit kiya, yadhyapi yah gathbandhan main tha
 The virtues of the political alliance had to cool the more radical agenda of the Sangh
 1975 main pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne desh main apatkaal lagu kar diya
 The Jana Sangh started a widespread protest against it, due to which thousands of its activists were put in jail across the country
 1977 main apatkaal khatm hua or iske baad aam chunaav huye
 In this election, the Jan Sangh was merged with the Bharatiya Lok Dal, Congress and Samajwadi Party to form the Janata Party and its main objective was to defeat Indira Gandhi in the elections
 1977 ke aam chunaav main janata party ko vishaal safalataa mili or morarji desai ke netritv main sarkaar bani
 After the death of Upadhyaya in 1979, Atal Bihari Bajpayee became the president of the Jana Sangh, so he went to China in this government

 General elections were held in 1980 after one term of the alliance
 bhartiya janata party 1980 main janata party ke vighatan ke baad navnirmit partiyon main se ek thi
 Although technically it was the second form of the Jana Sangh, most of its workers were its predecessors and Vajpayee was made its first president

 unki yah ranneeti asafal rahi or 1984 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ko keval do loksabhaa siton se santosh karnaa padaa
 Even after the assassination of Indira Gandhi shortly before the elections, not much improvement was seen and the Congress won with record seats

 andolan kaa aadhaar yah tha ki yah kshetra ram kii janmabhumi he or yahan par masjid nirmaan ke uddeshy se babar ne mandir ko dhwast karavaaya
 The BJP started supporting this campaign and made it a part of its election campaign

 In September 1990, Advani started a "rath Yatra" to Ayodhya in support of the Ram Temple movement
 yatra ke kaaran hone vaale dango ke kaaran bihar sarkaar ne adwani ko girafataar kar liya lekin kar sevak or sangh parivaar kaaryakarta phir bhi ayodhya pahunch gayi or babari dhaanche ke vidhwans ke liye hamalaa kar diya

 Satyajit Rai was an Indian film director, who is counted among the best film directors of the 20th century

 Rai studied economics from Presidency College, Kolkata, but was always interested in fine arts
 1940 main inaki mata ne aagrah kiya ki ye gurudev rabindranath thakur dwaara sthapit vishwa-bharti vishvavidhyalay main aage padhein
 Rai liked the atmosphere of Kolkata and was not particularly impressed with the intellectual world of Shantiniketan
 mata ke aagrah or thakur ke prati inke aadar bhav kii vajah se antat inhone vishwa-bharti jane kaa nishchay kiya
 In Shantiniketan, Rai was greatly influenced by Eastern art

 Started a job in Kemer
 inke pad kaa naam “laghu drashtaa” tha or maheene ke keval assi rupee kaa vetan tha
 Though Drishti Rachna Rai was well liked and treated mostly well, there was some tension between the British and Indian personnel of the agency as British personnel were paid more

 It was around 1943 that D

 Many of these pictures are visible in his film scenes
 raay ne do nae font bhi banaae — “raay roman” or “raay bijaar”
 Rai Roman won the prize in an international competition in 1970
 kolkata main raay ek kushal chitrakaar maane jate the
 Rai used to make his own pictures and home pages and also used to create publicity material for films

 Kemer sent Rai to the agency's headquarters in London
 landan main bitaye teen maheenon main raay ne 99 filmein dekhin
 These included the neoliberal film Ladri di Bicicletta of Financorio de Sica, which impressed him even further
 raay ne baad main kaha ki ve cinema se baahar aae to film nirdeshak banane ke liye drudhsankalp the
 The success in films did not change Rai's family life too much
 ve apni maan or parivaar ke anya sadasyon ke saath hi ek kiraye ke makaan main rahete rahe
 In the 1960s, Rai traveled to Japan and met well-known film director Akira Kurosawa
 bharat main bhi ve aksar shahar ke bhaagam-bhaag vaale maahaul se bachane ke liye darjeeling yaa puri jaisi jagahon par jaakar ekaant main kathanak puure karte the
 While working on the film Ghare Byre in 1983, Rai suffered a heart attack which severely reduced his performance in the remaining 9 years of his life
 ghare bire kaa chhayankan raay ke bete kii madad se 1984 main puraa hua
 In 1992, Rai's health deteriorated due to debility of the heart, from which he could never recover
 mrityu se kuch hi hafte pehle unhen sammaandaayak academy puraskaar diya gaya
 He died on 23 April 1992
 inaki mrityu hone par kolkata shahar lagbhag thahar gaya or hazaron log inke ghar par inhen shradhanjali dene aae
 Rai had decided that his first film would be based on the famous Bildungsaromon Pather Panchali of Bengali literature, written in 1928 by Bibhuti Bhushan Bandyopadhyay
 is ardh-aatmakathaatmak upanyaas main ek bengali gaanv ke ladke apu ke bade hone kii kahani he
 Rai designed the film during his return voyage from London to India
 bharat pahunchne par raay ne ek karmidal ekatrit kiya jisamen cameraman subrat mitra or kala nirdeshak bansi chandragupta ke alaava kisi ko filmon kaa anubhav nahin tha
 The actors were also almost all unprofessional
 film kaa chhayankan 1952 main shuru hua
 Rai invested his money in this film, in the hope that the first few shots would get money from somewhere, but it did not happen
 pather panchali kaa chhayankan teen varsh ke lambe samay main hua — jab bhi raay yaa nirmaan prabandhak anil choudhary kahin se paison kaa jugad kar pate the, tabhi chhayankan ho paata tha
 Rai refused to take money from sources who wanted to change the plot or supervise the filmmaker
 1955 main pashchim bengal sarkaar ne film ke liye kuch rin diya jisase aakhirkaar film puri hui
 The government also wanted to make some changes in the film but Satyajit Rai paid no attention to it
 pather panchali 1955 main pradarshit hui or bahut lokapriy rahi
 In India and other countries also it was engaged in cinema for a long time
 bharat ke aalochakon ne ise bahut saraahaa
 The Times of India wrote - “to compare it to any other Indian cinema is meaningless
 pather panchali to shuddh cinema he
 Lindsey Anderson in the United States wrote a very good review about the film
 lekin sabhi aalochak film ke bare main itane utsahit nahin the
 François Truffo said - "I do not see a film showing people eating food by hand
" ” new york times ke prabhaavshaalee aalochak bozli crouther ne bhi pather panchali ke bare main bahut buree samiksha likhi
 Despite this, the film went on for a long time in America
 raay kii agali film aparajito kii safalataa ke baad inkaa antararashtriya karier puure jor-shor se shuru ho gaya
 The film depicts the frequent stretch between the aspirations of a young man and his mother
 mrinal sen or ruthvik ghatak sahit kai aalochak ise pehali film se behatar maanate hai
 Aparajito was awarded the Swarn Singh at the Venice Film Festival
 apu trayee puri karne se pehle raay ne do or filmein banaain — hasyaprad parsh pathar or zameendaaron ke patan par aadhaarit jalsaghar
 The aquarium is counted among his most important works
 aparajito banaate hue raay ne trayee banane kaa vichaar nahin kiya tha, lekin venice main uthe ek prashn ke baad unhen yah vichaar acha laga
 The final episode of this series, Apur Sansar, was formed in 1959
 raay ne is film main do nae abhinaytaon, saumitr chatarji or sharmila tagore, ko mauka diya
 In this film, Apu lives in poverty in a simple house in Kolkata and gets married to Aparna, after which he has to face many difficulties
 pichhali do filmon kii tarah hi kuch aalochak ise trayee kii sabase badhiya film maanate hai 
 When a Bengali critic strongly criticized the Apur Sansar, Rai wrote a long article in response to this
 is avadhi main raay ne kai vishyon par filmein banaain, jinamein shaamil hai, british kaal par aadhaarit devi, rabindranath thakur par ek vruttchitr, hasyaprad film mahapurush or moulik kathanak par aadhaarit inaki pehali film kanchanajangha 
 During this time, he made many such films, which together are considered to be the deepest portrayal of women in Indian cinema
 apur sansar ke baad raay kii pehali film thi devi, jisamen inhone hindu samaaj main andhvishwaas ke vishay ko tatola he
 Sharmila Tagore played the main character of the film, Dayamayi, who is considered to be an incarnation of her father-in-law Kali
 raay ko chintaa thi ki is film ko sensor board se shaayad sweekruti nahin mili, yaa unhe kuch drishy kaatane paden, lekin aisa nahin hua
 In 1961, at the insistence of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Rai made a documentary on Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur's birth centenary on his life
 thakur ke jivan kaa filmakan bahut kam hi hua tha, isliye raay ko mukhyatah sthir chitron kaa prayog karnaa padaa, jisamen unke anusaar teen fichar filmon jitna parishram hua
 In the same year, Rai along with Subhash Mukhopadhyay and other writers revived the children's magazine Sandesh
 is patrika kii shuruyaat inke dada ne shuru kii thi or bahut samay se raay iske liye dhan jamaa karte aa rahe the
 Sandesh means two-way in Bangla - one is news and the other is sweets
 patrika ko isi mul vichaar par banaaya gaya — shiksha ke saath-saath manoranjan
 Rai soon started drawing himself in magazines and writing stories and essays for children
 aane vaale varshon main lekhan inaki jeevika kaa pramukh saadhan ban gaya
 In 1962, Rai directed Kanchanjangha, in which he first did colorful cinematography on the original plot
 is film main ek ucch varg ke parivaar kii kahani he jo darjeeling main ek dopaher bitaate hai or prayaas karte hai ki sabase choti beti kaa vivaah landan main padhe ek kamau ejeeniyar ke saath ho jaae
 Initially the idea was to portray the film in a sprawling mansion, but Rai later decided to use the Darjeeling atmosphere and play of light and fog to showcase the plot vibe
 raay ne hansi main ek baar kaha ki unki film kaa chhayankan kisi bhi roshni main ho saktaa tha, lekin usee samay darjeeling main maujuud ek vyavsaayik film dal ek bhi drishy nahin shoot kar paaya kyonki unhone keval dhoop main hi shooting kerani thi
 In 1964, Rai made a Charulata film, which many critics consider to be his most masterminded film
 yah thakur kii laghukatha nashtnid par aadhaarit he
 It contains the story of a lonely 19th-century woman who falls in love with her brother-in-law
 ise raay kii sarvotkrisht kriti mana jaataa he
 Rai himself said that it has the least flaws and this is the only film that he will recreate in the same way when he gets a chance
 chaaru ke rup main madhavi mukherjee ke abhinay or subrat mitra or bansi chandragupta ke kaam ko bahut saraahaa gaya he
 Other films of this period are: Mahanagar, Teen Kanya, Abhiyan, Kapurush and Mahapurush
 charulatha ke baad ke kaal main raay ne vividh vishyon par aadhaarit filmein banaain, jinamein shaamil hai, kalpanakthaayen, vigyankathaayen, guptchar kathaayen or aitihaasik naatak
 Rai started experimenting on new techniques in films and focusing on contemporary themes in India
 is kaal kii pehali mukhya film thi nayak, jisamen ek film abhinayta rail main safar karte hue ek mahila patrkaar se miltaa he
 The film, based on 24-hour events, explores the psychology of this famous actor
 berlin main is film ko aalochak puraskaar mila, lekin anya pratikriyaayein adhik utsaahpurn nahin raheen
 In 1967, Rai wrote the script for a film called To Be The Alien
 yah inaki laghukatha bankubabur bandhu par aadhaarit thi jise inhone sandesh patrika ke liye 1962 main likhaa tha
 The producer of this america-india co-production project was a company called Colombia Pictures
 peter sellers or marlan brando ko isaki mukhya bhoomikaaon ke liye chunaa gaya
 Rai was surprised to learn that his plot had been taken over by someone else
 brando baad main is pariyojna se nikal gaye or raay kaa bhi is film se moh-bhang ho gaya
 Colombia attempted to revive the project several times in the 1970s and 80s, but the matter never progressed
 raay ne is pariyojna kii asafalataa ke kaaran 1980 ke ek site and sound praaroop main ginaae hai or anya vivaran inke aadhikarik jeevani lekhak andru robinson ne da inner aai main diye hai
 When in 1982 E
T
 When the film was released, Rai saw many similarities between his plot and the film
 raay kaa vishwaas tha ki steven spilberg kii yah film unke kathanak ke bina sambhav nahin thi 
 In 1969, Rai made his most commercially successful film - Guppy Gine Bagha Baine
 yah sangitamay film inke dada dwaara likhi ek kahani par aadhaarit he
 The king of ghosts gives three boons to the singer Goopi and Dholi Bagha, with the help of which they stop the war in two neighboring countries
 yah raay ke sabase kharchile udhyamon main se thi or iske liye puunji bahut mushkil se mili
 Rai eventually had to abandon the idea of making it colorful
 raay kii agali film thi aranyer dinaraatri, jisaki sangeet-sanrachana charulatha se bhi jatil maani jaati he
 It has the story of four young men who go to the jungle for holiday
 isamen simi gareval ne ek junglee jati kii aurat kii bhoomika nibhaai he
 Critics consider it an image of the mentality of the Indian middle class
 iske baad raay ne samasamyik bengali vaastaviktaa par dhyaan dena shuru kiya
 The Naxalite revolution was gaining momentum in Bengal at that time
 aise samay main navayuvakon kii maansikta ko lekar inhone kalakatta trayee ke naam se jane vaali teen filmein banaain — pratidwandvi, seemaabaddh or jayeerany

 isamen ek bhuulaa-bisraa mamaa apni bhanji se achaanak milane aa pahunchataa he, to uske aane ke vaastavik kaaran par shankaa kii jane lagati he
 Satyajit Rai believed that writing the plot is an integral part of direction
 yah ek kaaran he jisaki vajah se unhone prarambh main bangla ke atirikt kisi bhi bhashaa main film nahin banaai
 For both his films made in other languages, he first wrote the plot in English, which was translated by the translators into Hindi or Urdu under his supervision
 raay ke kala nirdeshak bansi chandragupta kii drushti bhi raay kii tarah hi paini thi

 Critics say that they run at the speed of a "royal snail"

 They flow in peace like a huge river
 ” iske atirikt kuch aalochak inaki maanavtaa ko sada or inke kaaryon ko aadhuniktaa-virdohi maanate hai or kehete hai ki inaki filmon main abhivyakti kii nai sheliyaan nahin nazar aati hai
 He says that Rai “assumes that the audience will be interested in a film that focuses only on the characters, rather than a film that brings a new twist to their lives
 ” Rai has also been criticized by politicians of socialist ideologies

 According to Heidegger, art opens the doors of a new world, truth not only decreases in the form of art, it also inaugurates the existence of things in the realm of our own experience
 is tarah saundaryashastra ke madhyam se haidagar ne aadhuniktaa kii aalochana karte hue vastuon kii parmparik astitv-mimasaa or praudyogikeey vyakhya ko aade haathon liya
 By the mid-twentieth century, the utility of aesthetics began to be questioned
 sadi kii shuruyaat main diye gayi apane kuch vyakhyanon main edward bulo yah prashn puch chuke the ki kahin kala or saundarya kii paribhaashaayen kalakaar kii srijan- kshamta kaa kshay to nahin kar rahi hai
 These lectures were published in 1957 and in the sixties American artist Barnett Newman declared that the use of aesthetics is the same for art as that of ornithology for birds
 arthath saundaryashastra se anbhigya kalakaar hi acha he
 Under the study of culture, the oriented trends of aesthetics have been rigorously tested
 pier bordiyo ne samskruti ke samajashaastra ke tahat kala ke vichaardhaaratmak aadhaar kii na keval shinaakht kii balki yah bhi kaha ki isi kaaran se saundayshaastra apni hi saanskrithik or raajnneetik jadon kaa sandhan nahin kar paaya he
 Bordeaux's counterpoint to this idea is found in Adorno's work Aesthetic Theory
 adorno beesvin sadi kii avangaard kala kaa udhaaharan dete hue kehete hai ki kala main abhi bhi vichaardhaara kaa pratwaad karne kii kshamta he
 According to Adorno, art is a product of its society, but its creation process also contains an autonomous moment from social determinism
 isliye vah kalakaar or uske darshak yaa pathak ko tatkaaleen prabhutvshaalee samskruti dwaara thamaye gayi taur- tareekon se itar sochane kaa mauka bhi detii he
 Some Marxist scholars have also tried to develop a Marxist category of aesthetics
 hindi ke pramukh marxvaadi saahityalochak namvar singh ne is tarah kii koshishon ko aalochanatmak drushti se dekhte hue iskaa pehla udhaaharan soviet sangh main ‘samaajawaadee yatharthwaad’ kaa shaastra-nirmaan mana he
 He has said, 'with the formation of scripture, social reality was also formulated and the style of expressing that reality too
 dekhte-dekhte ek nayaa ritivaad chal padaa, rachana main bhi, aalochana main bhi
 The country which had a socialist revolution, did not hesitate to make any revolution in the field of literature and art
 yatharth kaa aisa or itnaa apmaan to kranti ke pehle ke sahitya main bhi nahin hua tha or unnisvin sadi ke europe ke sahitya main bhi nahin jab burjwa kranti ne yatharthwaad ko janm diya tha
 The condition became very much like that of the literature-trend called Hindi rituals, when poems were being written keeping the characteristic texts of the rhetoric
 ’ Namvar Singh gives another example of a large treatise called Aesthetics by George Lukach
 ve ise lukach dwaara apane lagbhag saath varshon ke deergh sahitya-chintan ko antat ek vyavasthit shaastra main baandhane kaa viraat prayaas qaraar dete hai, ‘hazaron prishthon kaa yah vishaal granth abhi tak german bhashaa main hi uplabdh he or jo german acchhee tarah jaanate honge, vahi iske bare main kuch vishwaspurvak kah sakane main sakasham honge
 On the basis of what has been said about him so far in English and the impression he has received from his sporadic excerpts, it can be said that it has failed to try all the arts in 'imitation'
 is prakaar marxvaadi lukach jab sabhi kalaon ko ek shaastra main baandhane chalate hai to antat arestu kii sharan jane ko baadhya hote hai
 An English weekly reviewing this treatise had published a cartoon in which Aristotle's appearance and appearance with Lukach Marx's beard
 ’ namvar singh kii manyata he ki lukach ke drushtaant se marxvaadi saundaryashastra kii is lambi parampara kaa ek kamazor pahalu saamne aata he
 He says that 'often he himself failed to challenge an institution called' Kala 'and saw no harm in accepting the classical definition of art
 buniyadi rup main ek baar in paribhaashaon ko sweekaar kar lene ke baad to phir thode- bahut her-pher ke saath is-us kavi yaa kriti ke moolyankan kaa kaary hi shesh rahata he; or kehane kii aavashyaktaa nahin ki marxvaadi saundaryashastriyon ne is kshetra main apni pratibha kaa johar bakhubi dikhaaya he— unchi samskruti ke bade-se- bade vichaarkon se hode lete hue
 The language of interpretation and evaluation is certainly materialistic as well as historical, but overall it is not very different from the dominant tradition

 duhman, pakistan ke punjab praant ke chakvaal zile kaa ek kasbaa or union parishad he
 The main language spoken here is Punjabi, while Urdu is often understood everywhere
 saath hi angrezi bhi kai logon dwaara kaafii had tak samajhi jaati he
 Prabhukh administrative languages are Urdu and English
 yah puraana param pavitra veda kii prasiddh shrutiyon ke arth se anumodith, akhil shastron ke rahasyaka strot tathaa aagmon main apana prasiddh sthaan rakhata he
 These cantos, antigens, clans, hereditary, manvantara etc
 are full of all the five characteristics
 paramba bhagwati ke pavitra aakhyaanon se yukt he
 This Purana contains about 18,000 verses
 ek baar bhagwat-anuraagi tathaa puneatma maharishiyon ne shri vedavyas ke param shishy sutaji se prarthana kii-he gyanasagar ! aapke shrimukh se vishnu bhagwaan or shankar ke daivi charitra tathaa adbhut lilaayen sunakar ham bahut sukhi hue
 Faith in God increased and knowledge gained
 ab krupa kar maanav jati ko samast sukhon ko uplabdh karaane vaale, atmik shakti dene vaale tathaa bhoga or moksh pradaan karaane vaale pavithratam puraana aakhyaan sunaakar anugrihit kiijie
 Knowing the sincere desire of the knowledgeable and humble Mahatmas, Mahamuni Sutaji accepted the grace
 unhone kaha-jan kalyaan kii laalasaa se aapane badi sundar ichha prakat kii
 i tell you to him
 yah sach he ki shri mad devi bhagwat puraana sabhi shastron tathaa dharmik granthon main mahaan he
 Big pilgrimage and fast are negligible in front of it
 is puraana ke sunne se paap sookhe van kii bhaanti jalakar nasht ho jate hai, jisase manushya ko shok, klesh, du:kha aadi nahin bhogane padate
 Just as darkness is cut off in front of the sunlight, similarly, hearing of Bhagavat Purana eliminates all the sufferings, diseases and inhibitions of human beings
 mahatmaon ne sutaji se bhagwat puraana ke sambandh main ye jigyaasaaen rakhin: By the combination of Maharishi Parashar and Goddess Satyavati, Anshvatar Dev Vyasji of Srinarayan was born
 vyasaji ne apane samay or samaaj kii sthiti pahachaanate hue vedon ko chaar bhaagon main vibhakt kiya or apane chaar patu shishyon ko unka bodh karaayaa
 After this, he created eighteen Puranas for the welfare of the male and female retarded women, who were deprived of the right to study, so that they too would be able to practice religion
 sutaji ne kaha-mahatman! guruji ke aadeshaanusaar satraa puraanon ke prasar evam prachaar kaa daayitv mujh par aayaa, kintu bhoga or mokshadaata bhagwat puraana swayan guruji ne janmejay ko sunaaya
 You know - Janmejaya's father Raja Parikshit was bitten by the Takshak serpent and the king listened to Srimad Bhagavat Purana for the welfare of his murder
 raja ne nau din nirantar lokmata bhagwati durga kii puja-aradhana kii tathaa muni vedavyas ke mukh se lokmata kii mahima se purna bhagwat puraana kaa shravan kiya
 Sutji said - Mahatma! According to Guruji's responsibility, the responsibility of spreading and propagating seventeen Puranas came upon me, but the Bhog and Mokshadata Bhagavata Purana itself was narrated by Guruji to Janmejaya
 aap jaanate hai-janmejay ke pita raja parakshit ko takshak sarp ne das liya tha or raja ne apni hatya ke kalyaan ke liye shrimad bhagwat puraana kaa shravan kiya tha
 The king worshiped Lokmata Bhagwati Durga for nine days continuously and listened to the full Bhagavata Purana with the glory of Lokmata from the mouth of Muni Ved Vyasa
 shri krishna prasenjit ko dhundhane ke prayaas main kho gaye the jo shri devi bhagwati ke aashirwad se sakushal laut aae
 While narrating this account in detail with the wishes of the Maharishi, Mr
 Sutji started saying - Gentlemen Long ago, Bhojwanshi King Satrajit lived in Dwarka Puri
 surya kii bhakthi-aradhana ke bal par usne swamantak naam kii atyant chamakdaar mani praapt kii
 Due to the revolution of Mani, the king himself became sun-like
 is bhram main jab yadavon ne shrikrishna se bhagwaan surya ke aagaman kii baat kahi, tab antaryami krishna ne yadavon kii shankaa kaa nivaaran karte hue kaha ki aane vaale mahanubhav swamantak manidhari raja satrajit hai, surya nahin
 The virtue of the self-styled gem was that the person holding it would receive eight kilos of gold per day
 us pradesh main kisi bhi prakaar kii maanviya yaa divine vipatti kaa koi chihn tak nahin tha
 Krishna himself aspired to receive the Swatantak Mani, but Satrajit rejected it
 ek baar satrajit kaa bhai prasenjit us mani ko dhaaran karke ghode par chadhakar shikaar ko gaya to ek singh ne use maar daalaa
 Incidentally, a bear named Jamwant killed Singh and he took Mani to his cave
 jamavant kii beti mani ko khilonaa samajhakar khilne lagi
 On Prasenjit's return, a rumor spread in Dwarka that Krishna was assassinated by Sranjith's refusal to grant Mani to Krishna and took possession of Mani
 krishna is afvaah se du:khee hokar prasenjit ko khojane ke liye nikal pade
 In the forest, Krishna and his companions found a lion dead along with Prasenjit
 unhen vahaan rich ke pairon ke nishaanon ke sanket bhi mili, jo bheetar gupha main pravesh ke suchak the
 With this Krishna speculated to kill Singh and near Mani's bear
 apane saathiyon ko baahar rahakar pratiksha karne ke liye kahkar swayan krishna gupha ke bheetar pravesh kar gaye
 After a long time, the returned companion, disheartened when Krishna did not return, falsely propagated the death of Krishna
 krishna ke na lautne par unke pita vasudev putr-shok main vyathit ho uthe
 At the same time Maharishi Narada came
 samachar jaanakar naradji ne vasudev se shrimad devi bhagwat puraana ke shravan kaa upadesh diya
 Vasudev was previously familiar with the grace of Mother Bhagwati
 unhone naradji se kaha-devarshi, devaki ke saath karagaravaas karte hue jab chha: putr kansa ke haathon maare ja chuke the to ham donon pati-patni kaaphi vyathit or ansatulit ho gaye the
 Then he consulted his clan priest Maharishi Garg and asked for a solution to get rid of trouble
 gurudev ne jagadamba maa kii gaatha kaa parayan karne ko kaha
 Being in prison was not possible for me
 at: gurudev se hi yah kaary sampann karaane kii prarthana kii
 Vasudev said - By accepting my prayer, Gurudev went to Vindhyachal mountain and worshiped the goddess with the Brahmins
 vidhi-vidhanpurvak devi bhagwat kaa nawahr yajna kiya
 On completion of the ritual, Gurudev informing me of this, said - Goddess has pleased this Akashvani - With my inspiration, Vishnu himself will incarnate the house of Vasudev Devaki to alleviate the suffering of the earth
 vasudev ko chahie ki us balak ko gokul gram ke nand-yashoda ke ghar pahunchaa den or usee samay utpann yashoda kii balika ko laakar aathvin santan ke rup main kansa ko saunp den
 Kans, as always, would throw the baby girl to the ground
 vah balika kansa ke haath se tatkaal chhootakar divya sharir dhaaran kar, mere hi ansh rup se lok kalyaan ke liye vidhyanchal parvat par vaas karegi
 On hearing this ritual fruit by Garga Muni, i expressed happiness and completed the following events according to Muni's statement and protected Krishna
 yah vivaran sunaakar vasudev naradji se kehane lage-muniver ! saubhaahgya se aapkaa aagaman mere liye shubh he
 Therefore, please oblige me by narrating the story of Goddess Bhagwat Purana
 vasudev ke kehane par naarad ne anugrah karte hue nawahr parayan kiya
 At the end of the ninth day, Vasudeva worshiped Naradji and when Krishna entered the cave from the Maya of Bhagwati's mother, he saw a girl playing with a gem
 jaise hi krishna ne balika se mani lee, to balika ro uthi
 Hearing the crying of the girl, Jamwant arrived there and started fighting with Krishna
 donon main sattaees din tak yuddh chalata rahaa
 By the grace of Goddess, Jamwant continued to suffer and Shri Krishna became powerful
 ant main unhone jamavant ko parajeet kar diya
 By the grace of Bhagwati, Jamwant had a prior memory
 treta main ravan kaa vadh karne vaale ram ko hi dwapar main krishna ke rup main avatarit jaanakar unki vandana kii
 Apologized for the crime committed in ignorance
 mani ke saath apni putree jambavati ko bhi prasantaapurvak krishna ko samarpit kar diya
 After the narrative ended in Mathura, Vasudev was taking blessings after the Brahmin banquet, at the same time Krishna reached there with Mani and Jambavati
 krishna ko vahaan dekhakar sabhi kii prasannataa kii koi seemaa na rahi
 In gratitude to Bhagwati, vasudev-devaki welcomed Shri Krishna with tearful eyes
 vasudev kaa safal kaam banaakar naarad devloak waapas laut gaye
 According to the Goddess Bhagwat Purana, Sutji while narrating this story to the incoming monks said, Sridvalu sages! The devotees should take advice from any astrologer to get the auspicious time for Katha Shravan or it is suitable for Navratras
 is anushthan kii soochna vivaah ke samaan hi apane sabhi bandhu-baandhvon, sage-sambandhiyon, parichiton, brahman, kshatriyon, vaishyon, shudron evam striyon ko bhi aamantrit karnaa chahie
 Whoever can give more time in listening, definitely give it
 sabhi aagantukon kaa swaagat satkar aayojan kaa dharm he
 The place of legend should be dipped with cow dung and hang a dome shaped canopy over it and hoist a flag containing goddess image over it
 katha sunaane ke liye sadaachari, karmkandi, nirlobhi kushal upadeshak ko hi niyukt karnaa chahie
 Retire from morning bath, etc
, and put a clean cloth and establish a Kalash
 ganesh, navagraha, yogini, maatrakaa, kshetrapal, batuka, tulsi vishnu tathaa shankar aadi kii puja karke bhagwati durga kii aradhana kerani chahie
 Goddess Bhagwat Granth should be worshiped by worshiping Goddess Shodashopachara and pray for the Goddess Yagya to end uninterrupted
 pradakshina or namaskara karte hue devi kii stuti prarambh kerani chahie
 After that, one should listen to the Devi Katha while meditating
 katha ke shravankaal main shrota athwa vaktaa ko kshor karm nahin karwaanaa chahie
 Sleeping celibacy on the ground, simple food restraint, pure conduct, true speech, and fasting for non-violence should be taken
 taamas padaarth yatha-pyaaj, lahasun, maance, madiraa aadi kaa bhakshan bhi varjit he
 The female affair should be forcibly abandoned
 navahn yajna kii samaapti par nawein din anushthan kaa udhyapan karnaa chahie
 On that day both the speaker and the Bhagavata Purana should be worshiped
 brahman tathaa kumarikaon ko bhojan evam dakshina dekar trupt karnaa chahie
 Home to the Gayatri Mantra, donating it to the Bhagavata Purana speaker Brahmin installed on the Golden Manjusha, should leave him satisfied with Dakshinadi
 purvokt vidhi-vidhaan se nishkaam bhav se parayan karne vaala shrota shraddhalu mokshapad ko or sakaam bhav se parayan karne vaala apane abhisht ko praapt karata he
 At the time of storytelling, any type of conversation, meditation, change of posture, sleeplessness or insolence can cause great loss, so do not do this
 sutaji maharaj ne kaha-atharah puraanon main devi bhagwat puraana usee prakaar sarvottam he, jis prakaar nadiyon main ganga, devon main shankar, kaavyon main ramayana, prakaash sroton main surya, sheetaltaa or ahlad main chandramaa, kshamashilon main prithvi, gambhirtha main sagar or mantron main gayatri aadi shreshth hai
 This Purana conducts autobiography by listening to all kinds of sufferings

 The term is named after the mid-life crisis
 isaki pahchaan karne vaali sabase pehali pustak quarterlife chrysis, da unic changes of life in yor twanties thi jiske sah-lekhak abbi vilnar or alexander robins the; jabaki saathiyon ke shodh ke aadhaar par vyavhaarik samaadhaan prastut karne vaali pratham pustak thi demian baar kii get it tugedar: e guide tu cerviving yor quarterlife chrysis thi
 An early description of this fact has been considered by Eric H
 Erickson, but its present form differs from the arguments of Wilner, Robbins, and Barr
 quarter life chrysis ke lakshanon main ye shaamil ho sakate hai: Such restless feelings and insecurities are neither uncommon for this age nor for any age of adult life
 However, in the context of the Quarter Life Crisis, this occurs immediately after a young man - in this context, usually an educated professional - enters the "real world"
 vayask jivan main pravesh or zindagi kii jimmedaariyon se saamana hone ke baad kuch vyakti khud ko kariyar ke tehraav or ati asuraksha ke anubhav se guzarataa hua mahasoos karte hai
 The individual often realizes that the real world is harder, more competitive and less forgiving than the world of his / her imagination
 ek sambandhit samasya yah he ki kai college snaatak, snaatak hone ke baad apekshit jivan str hasil nahin kar pate hai
 Instead of earning a high income to make a living, they often live in low income apartments living with other peers
 naukari main tuchh yaa baar-baar doharaaya jane vaala ubaau kaam, jivan nirvaah kii ghatiya paristithiyon ke saath milakar kaaphi zyada niraashaa, uttejnaa or gussa paidaa karata he
 No one wants to admit to feeling like "defeated", this privacy can aggravate the problem
 jaise hi kishoravastha or college jivan ke bhaavnaatmak utaar-chadhaav shant padate hai, quarter life chrysis se grast kai log bhaawanaaon kii "neerasata" kaa anubhav karte hai
 Apart from this, difficulty in keeping pace with the work place can also be a factor contributing to the quarter life crisis
 college main professor kii apekshaayen spasht taur par di jaati hai or chaatro ko paathyakram ke dauraan apane pradarshan par jaldi-jaldi pratikriya milti rahati he
 a person progresses year after year in the education system
 iske vipareet kaary sthal ke maahaul ke bheetar koi apane pradarshan par bos kii nakhushi yaa apane sahakarmi kii uske vyaktitv ke prati naapsandgi se bilkul bekhbar bhi rah saktaa he
 No one progresses on his own
 offis kii raajnneeti main parsparik sambandh kaushal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo shaikshik maahaul main safalataa ke liye zyaadaatar anaavashyak hota he
 One of the main causes of stress associated with the "quarter Life Crisis" is financial; Most professionals have become highly competitive in recent years
 saanchaa:where? vishvidhyalay main purnavadhi pad or kanoonee fermon main "saajhedaar" kii haisiyat jaise apekshaakrit surakshit padon kii sankhya main lagaataar kami ai he
 Along with this, excessive job cuts mean that many people will never be able to experience business safety in their lives and the probability of this happening in young adulthood is even less

 According to a research by pension provider Standard Life, only half of people are saving for pensions and half of them think they are not paying much

 Bars were also involved in this research
 ek aisa yug jab peshewar kariyar kaa arth hota tha vyavsaayik suraksha kaa jivan or vyavsaayik pension - is tarah ek vyakti ko aatanrik jivan kii sthapana kii ore aage badhane kaa avkaash miltaa tha - apane ant ko praapt hota hua dikh rahaa he
 Financial professionals are often expected to work at least 80 hours per week in the office in situations leading to stress related disorders, and those in the legal, medical, educational and management professions may average over 60
 zyaadaatar maamalon main kaam ke ye lambe ghante vastav main anaichhik hote hai jo aarthik or saamaajik asuraksha ko darshaate hai
 Since this evil is troubling adults of all ages, its worst victims are the young adults who could not establish themselves
 college snaatak shaareerik or maansik rup se kai kaary karne me sakasham hote hai, lekin unke paas naukari paane ke liye aavashyak 1-2 saal ke anubhav kii kami hoti he or parinamswaroop ve aise saadhaaran thakaaoo tathaa ubaau kaam karne ke liye majaboor hote hai jiske liye unki yogyata kahin zyada hoti he
 Some students in college spend all their time working hard to graduate on time and score good marks but do not gain the "real world" experiences to get a job
 is prakaar kii kaich-22 paristhiti chaatro ke liye bahut kathin hoti he: naukari paane ke liye degree hona anivaary he lekin bina 1-2 saal ke vyavhaarik anubhav ke inhen naukari nahin mil paati he
 This sequence can be quite frustrating for new graduates
 kuch snaatakon ko, jo graduate hone ke baad sammanit naukari praapt kar lete hai, college ke dauraan naukari main aam taur par prati saptaah 15-20 ghante kaam karnaa hota he or iske kaaran ve upyukt samay prabandhan lagu kiye bina vishvidhyalay jivan ke saamaajik kaaryakramon se vanchit rah sakate hai
 Such students often aspire to romantic relationships but they do not have time to build and continue these relationships in college
 In this way, they get a job after college but the desire for a romantic partner remains and they feel unquenchable, incomplete like graduates who have a partner but no job
 da cheeting culture main david kailahan kehete hai ki ati pratispardhaa or asuraksha kii ye buraaiyaan hameshaa kisi ke sthapit hone ke saath hi anivaary rup se khatm nahin hoti hai or isliye quarter life chrysis vastav main vayaskta ke pare bhi jari rah sakati he
 Certain measures of financial security - which require occupational security - are necessary for psychological development
 kuch logon ne anumaan lagaaya he ki "nai arthvyavastha" me asuraksha, kaaphi saare logon ko prabhaavshaalee dhang se chirsthai kishoravastha kii sthiti main bana kar rakh degi or yah ki 1990 or 2000 ke dashak kaa tezi se failata or pratiyogi upabhoktavaad yah sanket detaa he ki aisa pehle se hi ho rahaa he
 Eric H
 Erickson, who proposed eight crises faced by humans during development, also proposed the existence of life crises occurring at this age
 apane vikasaatmak siddhant main unhone suzav diya ki insaan kii zindagi aath charnon main vibhajit he, prayek ke apane dwandv hai jinka samaadhaan manushya ko anivaary rup se talashna chahie
 unhone tarun vayaskta se jo dwandv joda vah he antarangta banaam ekaakipan kaa sankat
 unke anusaar kishoravastha main vaiyaktik pahchaan sthapit karne ke baad tarun vayask duusare logon ke saath gahan or aam taur par romani sambandh banane kii talash main rahete hai
 The version of the "quarter Life Crisis" proposed by Ericsson is quite different from the changes that occur in popular cultures
 darasal "quarter life chrysis" ke pop-samskruti sanskaran main us sankat ke adhik tatva sammilit hai jise arikson ne kishoravastha kii asmita banaam bhoomika-bhram se joda tha, yah is siddhant ko vishwasaneey banaata he ki beesvin sadi ke ant kaa jivan aaraam or asuraksha ke vicitra mail ke saath logon ke dhimi gati se paripakv hone kaa kaaran ban rahaa he

 Shruti is a group of the highest and paramount scriptures of Hinduism
 shruti kaa shabdic arth he suna hua, yani ishwar kii vaani jo pracheen kaal main rishiyon dwaara suni gai thi or shishyon ke dwaara sunakar jagat main failaai gai thi
 Due to this divine source, they are considered as the most important source of religion
 inke alaava anya granthon ko smriti mana gaya he - jinka arth he manushyon ke samaran or buddhi se bane granth jo vastutah shruti ke hi maanviya vivaran or vyakhya maane jate hai
 When there is any dispute between Shruti and Smriti, only Shruti gets recognition, not Smriti
 shruti main chaar veda aate hai : rugveda, samaveda, yajurveda or atharvaveda
 Every Veda has four parts: Samhita, brahmana-granth, Aranyaka and Upanishads
 inke alaava baaki sabhi hindu dharmagranth smriti ke antargat aate hai
 Whatever is said in the memories, scriptures, epics, texts, essays, Mahapuranas, it is only by accepting the great recognition of Shruti that such a belief is found in all ancient scriptures
 apane pramaan ke liye ye granth shruti ko hi adarsh bataate hai hindu paramparao ke anusaar is manyata kaa kaaran yah he ki ‘shrutu’ brahma dwaara nirmit he yah bhaavana jan saamaanya main prachlit he chunki sristi kaa niyanta brahma he isiilie uske mukh se nikle hue vachan purn pramanik hai tathaa prayek niyam ke aadi strot hai
 Its impression was so deep in ancient times that the word Veda became a sign of reverence and faith
 isiilie peeche kii kuch shastron ko mahatta pradaan karne ke liye unke rachayitaaon ne unke naam ke peeche veda shabd jod diya
 Probably this is the reason why the script of bow movement is given as archery and medical science is called Ayurveda
 mahabharat ko bhi pancham veda isiilie kaha gaya he ki uski mahatta ko atyadhik bal diya ja sake
 For example Manu Samhita is considered as Manusmriti
 iske anusaar samaaj, parivaar, vyapaar dandadi ke jo praavdhaan hai vah manu dwaara vichaarit or vedon kii vaani par aadhaarit hai
 But these are not words spoken by God
 atah ye ek smriti granth he
 But Ishavasyopanishad is a Shruti because it involves the translation of the voice of God by those sages
