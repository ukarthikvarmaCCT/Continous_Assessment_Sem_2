 Kumari was elected as the MLA of the region in the 2012 assembly elections
 kathini yaa crusteshia jeevajgat main sandhipad jeevon kaa ek mukhya vibhaag he, jisamen bade kekad, jhinge, chingt, prachingt, mahachingt, khandavar, kashtha euka tathaa jalpinshu ityadi hai, parantu iske sabase chote jeevon ko dekhne ke liye anuvikshan yantra kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 There is a huge difference in the type of difficulty of different castes, due to which it is very difficult to give a brief definition
 kathini kaa prayek lakshan, visheshkar iske parashrayi tathaa ucch vishesh jeevon main to, purna rup se kisi na kisi prakaar badal jaataa he
 The term crustacea has been used initially for those creatures whose armor is rigid and ductile
 iske vipareet duusare jeev ve hai jinka kavach tathaa bhangur hota he, jaise sip tathaa ghonghe ityadi
 But now it is known that the external skeleton of all arthropods is hard and soft
 is kaaran ab kathini ko anya lakshanon ke pruthak kiya jaataa he
 The creatures of this class are mostly water dwellers and there is no such reservoir in the world where there is no caste found in them
 is kaaran kathini varg ke jeev praaia: jalashvasanika athwa twachaa se shwaas lete hai
 These include two pairs of horns in front of the mouth and three pairs behind the face of Hanu
 kathini varg ke mukhya parichit jeev to jhingen or kekade hai jinka upyog maanav apane khaadya rup main karata he, parantu inase kahin adhik aarthik mahatv ke iske nimna jeev anfipadz,, isopidz, ityadi, hai jo uthle jalaashyon main samoohon main rahete hue sammarjak kaa kaam karte hai
 The food of these lower creatures are the objects of other creatures and flora, as well as they themselves become the food of higher beings, such as fish etc
 iske kai talaplavi sookshm jeev aise bhi hai jinke samooh milon tak sagar ke rang ko badal dete hai, jisase machhuon ko uchit matsaysthanon kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 In this way, they provide economic benefits by becoming fish meal as well as helping the fishermen
 is varg ke jeevon kaa kavach duusare sandhipad jeevon ke samaan hi khandon ke samoohon main vibhajit rahata he, parantu inamen se praaia: kuch khand ekibhanjit bhi haate hai
 Each segment is similar to the armor ring, which is attached to the flexible integum with its front and back sections
 prayek khand kaa chaap sadrush prishthiya patt, sternam kehalaata he or turgam ke donon parshv bhaag, jo patton ke rup main rahete hai, plura kehalaate hai
 a pair of limbs are attached to the sternum of each segment
 sharir kaa antim khand, jisapar guda hoti he, angahin rahata he or telson kehalaata he
 In modern difficulty, no such organism is found in which each segment is clearly distinct from each other
 udaahranarth, jhinge ke sharir ke agrabhag kaa kavach avibhajit tathaa naalakaar hota he or kairapes kehalaata he
 The number of its segments is estimated by the number of components associated with this part
 is bhaag main sanyukt khandon kii sankhya kam se kam chah maani gai he jisamen naitrik khand bhi sammilit hai
 This part is called head
 jab is bhaag main isse adhik khand sammilit rahete hai tab iske badwaale khandon ke avyav agle avyavon se purnat: pruthak hote hai
 The back sections of the head are divided into two parts of the body, chest and abdomen, which are separated by their different components
 parantu ucch kathini mailaakanstraca ityadi main vaksh ke khand sir main sammilit ho jate hai
 Then this joint part is named as Shirsovaksha
 is prakaar kairapes kaa rup bhi bhinn-bhinn kathini jeevon main anek prakaar paaya jaataa he
 It completely covers the body and limbs in the form of bivalve shells in Branchiopoda and Ostracoda, in the cirrpedia it is a muscular cavity shaped and calcified bandage is also placed to reinforce it
 ye to iske kuch vishesh rup hai, parantu saadhaaran naalakaar rup ke kairapes main vaksh ke ek se lekar saare khand sir main sammilit ho sakate hai
 Carapace is found in almost all of the various difficulties
 keval anestroca hi jeev hai jinamein kairapes nahin hota
 The convergent extremity of a tough body is found in its parasitic and suspended organisms
 khandavar apni prachhdhavastha main apane sir se mulabaddha rahete hai or saath hi unamem radial samamiti kii ore pravriti hoti he jiskaa kaaran inkaa sthagit jivan he
 In parasitic organisms, the body segment has disappeared and the shape of the body has also changed completely
 iskaa udhaaharan rizosephala he, jisamen kathini ke lakshan to kya, sandhipad jeevon kaa bhi koi lakshan praudhavastha main nahin dikhaai detaa
 Difficult creatures are mainly forest dwellers
 is kaaran anumaan kiya jaataa he ki is varg ke purvaj kaa sharir samaan khandon main vibhajit tha or prayek khand par ek jodi ang jude the
 Each of their components used to do all the work together like circulation, food, respiration and knowledge
 trilobita main avyavon kii aisi hi vyavastha maani gai he, parantu yah upvarg lupt ho gaya he
 So far in the modern difficulty, no such organism has been found, whose ingredients are with these four functions
 iske sir ke ang to bhinn-bhinn vishesh kaaryon ke liye upyukt hote hai, parantu brankiopoda ke dhad ke avyav ek samaan hote hai or kuch seemaa tak mana ja saktaa he ki inase chaaron kaary hote hai
 Otherwise, the feature of limbs has advanced in difficulty by many measures, because it is known that the organs which do one task in some difficulty, do the other tasks in the other difficulty
 kathini ke bheetar kaa vikaas mukhyat: in angon ke hi kartavya main niyantran par aadhaarit he
 No matter how hard the components are used for any task and no matter how different in size, their composition is mainly bicameral
 prayek avyav kaa aadhaarit vrutt dwikhandi hota he or ise sympod yaa protopodit kehete hai or iske upree khand se do shakhaayen endopodit or exopotide nikalati hai
 This type of root based ingredient is called Steinopodium
 aise saadhaaran dwishakhi avyav kopipod ke plavan pad, mailocostraca ke udar ang ityadi hai or aise hi ang purvaj dimbh main bhi, jise nopleius kehete hai, paae jate hai
 Similar elements take different forms for special tasks in other difficult organisms
 kathini ke netra do prakaar ke hote hai madhyam tathaa sanyukt netra
 Very simple middle eye noplias and many adults live in hardships, but in malacostraca they disappear and the combined eye is the working eye
 sanyukt netra praaia: ek jodi hote hai, jo kuch jeevon ke avrunt or kai ek main vrintyukt rahete hai
 The eye is considered to be a component of the head, but it is suspicious
 kaaran, parivardhan main yah duusare angon main bahut pashchaat udit hote hai
 The first horns, which remain in front of the mouth, are considered components of the second section
 yah nopleius tathaa sab upjatiyon ke jeevon main, keval mailocostraca ke atirikt, ekasakhi hoti hai
 Their main function is sensor, but in many eggs and adult difficulties they also come in the function of flotation and many males also capture the female from the ring
 siropedia main cement grathiyon ke chhidr inhen avyavon par hote hai, jinaki sahaayta se inke vayask sthagit hote hai
 Although the second horn is located in front of the mouth, it was actually located behind the mouth
 nopleius main iskaa sthaan mukh ke parshv main rahata he or yah bhojan ko mukh kii ore laane main sahaayta detii he
 The rest of its work is similar to the first ring
 melacostraca main isaki ek shakha bahusandhimaan kashang ke aakaar kii hoti he or iskaa kaary keval samvedan grahan he, parantu duusari shakha kaa aakaar chapate patt ke samaan hota he or yah plavan main santolan kaa kaary bhi karti he
 In Noplius and Vyaska Kopipoda, Isopoda, etc
, the adjoins are bicellular and help in feeding, but in many difficulties, the adjoins form the shape of Hanu and their surface is equipped with teeth and condoms
 parashrayi kathini ke adhohanu bedhan ke liye nalaakaar shund ke sadrush hote hai
 The protuberant and subalpine, or first and second maxillae, are always flattened like leaves, and the branches of Hanu are situated on their branches
 ye teenon mukh ke pichhali hanu hai
 In the posterior parts of the head, there is no particular difference among the bronchiopoda, copipoda etc
 and these organs are mainly similar
 inkaa aakaar melacostraca ke upjanbhak or upasambh main miltaa-julata hota he
 These types of ingredients are called filopodia
 parantu melacostraca ke dhad ke angon ko do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he-aath jodi vaksh ke avyav tathaa chah jodi udar ke avyav 
 They are completely different from each other
 vaksh ke avyav mukhyat: gati karne ke kaam main aate hai or isi kaaran inke endopodide, jo is kaary main pramukh bhaag lete hai, usee prakaar parivirtat ho jate hai, parantu inke exopodide, jo plavan main upyogi hote hai, inamen lupt ho gaye hai
 Before the thorax one or two pairs of components are often pectoral shaped, due to which they are named Anupada
 udar ke ang sadaa dwishakhi or plavan main upyogi hai
 The tail helps the organism in a special way by reversing the shape of the tail of the tail with the help of the last abdomen
 adhiktar nimna kathini sharital se saans lete hai, parantu jin jeevon kaa bahi:kankal adhik kathor ho gaya he ve shwasan kaary apane un sharirsthanon se karte hai jahaan kaa tal ksheen rah gaya he, jaise kairapes kaa astr; athwa yah kaam vishesh indriyon dwaara hota he, jinako jalashvasanika kehete hai
 Water reservoirs are the branches on the chest or its limbs, which are flattened in shape and whose blood flows within the microscopic walls
 decapoda main jalshvanikaaye apni sthiti ke aadhaar par teen shreniyon main rakhi gai hai-vakshangamul kii shakhikaaye, vakshaangon ke sameep kii shakhikaaye tathaa brankial mandal bhitari bhaag jo kerapes se dhake rahete hai
 Thalanivasi hardships, such as crabs, etc
, are well adapted to respiration — the floor of the lining of their brachial system acts as a lung
 anya jeevon main, jaise isopoda, kashthauka ityadi main, udarangon main shakhavinyast vaayu bhari nalikaay pai jaati hai, jo keet tathaa anya sthaljivon kii shwasanaliyon ke samaan hoti hai
 In difficulties, the alimentary canal is always straight throughout the body from front to end
 parantu is varg ke kuch aise jeev bhi hai jinamein yah nyudeshtit athwa kundalit bhi pai jaati he
 Like other arthropod organisms, it too is divided into three parts
 agrantra tathaa pashchantra, jinke chhidr mukh tathaa guda hai or jinka aantarik tal kytin se, jo bahya sharir ke kytin ke saath sanlagn rahata he, aachhadit rahete hai
 The third part is the middle, which lives between them
 agrantra kii peshiyaan prabal hoti hai or inke antareey tal par bal, kaante tathaa daant ityadi viksit rahete hai
 In Melacostraca, this part forms the stomach, in which gastric, gizzard and filtration equipment are special means to separate food juices from particles
 parantu peshni tathaa chanani praaia: hrideey tathaa nizthreey vibhaagon main pruthak rahete hai
 At the front end of the mid-intestine, there are a pair or more of liver cells whose functions are absorption and secretion and out of which branch can also form liver
 decapoda main yakrut granthi praaia: saare aavashyak enzim banaati he or saath apni guha se vanchit padaarthon kaa shoshan bhi karti hai
 In this, food is stored in the form of glycogen
 kuch decapoda main madhyantra bahut choti hoti he jiske kaaran aaharanlee keval agr tathaa pasch antra kii bani vidit hoti he
 In parasitic difficult organisms, the food pipe is either nominal or it is absolutely lacking
 anya sandhipad jeevon kii bhanti kathiniyon main bhi rudhir sharirguha tathaa gantikaon main pravaahit hota he
 Like other arthropods, the heart is also located within the posterior cardiovascular cavity
 brankiopoda, austracada tathaa kuch melacostraca main hriday praaia: sharir kii puri lambaai ke baraabar hota he or sharir ke antim bhaag khand ke atirikt prayek khand main isamen ek jodi kapatyut andhra hota he, jo hridayaavaran se ja miltaa he
 In other difficulties, the heart length is usually less
 dhamniyaan hriday se nikalakar rudhirsthanon main khulti hai, jahaan se rudhir sharir ke prayek bhaag tathaa ang se hota hua hridayaavaran main aata he
 The reservoir is located in this part to oxygenate the blood
 anek kathini aise bhi hai jinamein hriday nahin hota, jaise siripedia, kopipoda ityadi or inamen rudhiravahan sharir tathaa aharnali ke sanchaalan kii sahaayta se hota he
 Difficulties are the bloody fluid in which leukocyte is added and hemoglobin is also present in Entomestraca
 kathini kii mukhya utsarjan indriyaan shringika sambandhi tathaa upbhanj sambandhi do jodi granthiyaan hai jo inhen naamon ke angon ke aasthaanon par khulti hai
 The complete development of both the glands is never found together in one stage of any caste, so in different stages in the history of life, one after the other is functioning
 udaahranarth, jhinge tathaa duusare dashapadon kii vayask avasthaa main shringika sambandhi granthi kaaryshil hoti he or inke dimbh main upasambh sambandhi
 But most of the difficulties have the opposite situation
 inamen in donon grathiyon kii rachana ek samaan hoti he
 Each gland has three main parts: 1
 Antune, which is a remnant of the dehgue and a dilapidated inner part, 2
 Excretory canal and 3
 Altered exit system, which is connected to the antune and one part of which is the excitatory tube of adenoid wall
 
 utsargi nalika kaa adhar bhaag tathaa bahirgaman pranali donon badi hokar sangrahi mutrashay banaati hai
 The normal form of the central nervous system is also similar to other arthropod organisms
 mastishk kaa sanyog pratiprushthiya tantrikaraju ke saath parigrasika sanyojak ke dwaara rahata he
 The anterograde neuralgia is a double chain of tufts that are joined together by aggregates and joints
 praaia: chaar jodi bhruneey gucchhikaaye aapas main milakar mastishk banaati hai or netra gucchhika bhi isi main sammilit he
 In difficulty, in the state of the nervous system, there is a complete range from the ideal condition of the arthropods to the very concentric condition
 aadim brankiopoda main pratiprishth gucchhikaaon kii shrinkhalaa sidhiyon ke aakaar kii hoti he jaisi kuch enilidz main pai jaati he or jisamen shrinkhalaa ke donon bhaag ek duusare se pruthak rahete hai
 In other difficult groups, the two parts of the chain are often reconciled, as well as the flakes coming close to each other
 is shrenee kii antim dasha main, jo kekadon main pai jaati he, keval gucchhikaaon kaa ek samooh hi dikhaai detaa he
 Like independent and active organisms, the sexes are often different in difficulty, but the organisms of cirrpedia and many parasitic isopodas are also bisexual
 ye purvapumpakv hote hai jinamein pulling angon kaa parivardhan streeling angon se pehle hota he
 The micro-complementary males in seripedia, like parasites, often cling to ordinary or hermaphrodites of this caste, because their male parts cannot fully conceive
 anek brankiopoda tathaa austracoda main anishek janan bhi hota he
 Sexual dimorphism is also commonly found in them
 nar main maadaa ko pakadaney ke liye vishesh ang bhi rahete hai, jo sharir ke kisi bhaag se samparivartit hokar is kaary ke liye upyogi ho jate hai
 Males are often larger than females in higher tentacles, but in other groups the arrangement is the opposite
 donon lingon ke jananpind sadaa ek jodi naal indriyaan hoti hai, jo aaharanlee ke prishth par ek duusare se judi rahati hai
 They can also be simple or branched and ducts arise from them and often open outwards from the middle of the body
 siripedia main or kuch cladosira ke nar main yah chhidr sharir kii seemaa par rahete hai, parantu inaki maadaa main yah chhidr vaksh ke pratham khand par sthit rahete hai or melacostraca main bhi donon lingon main chhidr isi sthaan par rahete hai
 The eggs that are available in large numbers from the difficulty of the egg are completely different from the adult
 vayask avasthaa dhaaran karne ke purv jeev ko vibhinn dimbhon kii ek shrenee paar kerani padati hai jisamen pratham dimbh noples larva kehalaata he
 Each difficulty crosses this stage, whether it arises in a free flowered state or in embryonic form
 praroopik avasthaa main yah dimbh akhandit andakaar hota he, jisamen teen jodi avyav rahete hai or jo vayask ke antenulz, anteni or medibalz ban jate hai
 Its first pair are bicellular, and all of them help the noplus to float
 dwishakhi avyav bhojan ko mukh main pahunchaane kaa kaary bhi karte hai
 In front of its mouth, there is a large eardrum
 dimbh ke antra ke teenon bhaag agrantra, madhyantra tathaa pashchantra rahete hai
 In Astracoda, nauplius converges at the time of ovulation, as the bivalve caropase is amplified
 nimna jati ke kathiniyon main nopleius kaa parivartan kramash: hota he, jisamen khand ek-ek karke, peeche se aage, antim khand main judate jate hai
 Then the components begin to arise in these segments
 is prakaar isaki avasthaa anya roopon main paraveertit ho jaati he gimen metanopleius, cypris, zoiya, fillosoma, megalopa ityadi ullekhneey hai
 Mostly, all these stages are independent Talplavi
 keval alvan jal ke prachingt tathaa nadiyon ke jhinge hi aise jeev hai jinke parivardhan main vishesh roopaantar nahin hota
 In the composition of organisms of this class, there is more diversity than other classes
 is kaaran inkaa vargeekaran, jisamen aapas kii samaantaaon par vishesh dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he, ati jatil he
 This class is divided into the following subclasses with which the names of their main ganas are also inscribed: upvarg : brankiopoda- Gana: Anostraca, Notostraca, Conocostraca and Cladocera
 upvarg : austracoda- Gan: Miodocopa and Podacopa upvarg : kapipoda- Gan: Cyclopaedia, Lerniopodidea, Caligida, Kellenida etc
 upvarg : brancura- Gan: Argulidea
 upvarg : siripedia- Gana: Thoracica, Acrothoracica, Ascothoracica, Apoda and Roisocephala
 upvarg : melacostraca- Department: Filocerida - Gunn: Nibeneli vibhaag : sincrida -gana : enaspedesia Departments: Peracarida - Humans: Mycidacea, Comesia, Tanidesia, Isopoda and Amphipoda
 vibhaag : eukereda -gana : yuphossiesia tathaa decapoda 
 Department: hoplocarida-gum: Stomatopoda
 majheda, champavat tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke champavat jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Nyamdal has a village in Anantapur district under the state of Andhra Pradesh, India
 ebn battoota arab yatri, viddhan tathaa lekhak
 In the famous city of Tanzier in the Moroccan region of North Africa, 14 Rajab, 703 H
C
 He was born on inkaa puraa naam tha mohammad bin abdulla ebn battoota
 Ibn Battuta was the greatest of Muslim travelers
 anumaanath: inhone lagbhag 75,000 mile kii yatra kii thi
 Hardly any other traveler of that era has traveled so long
 apni yatra ke dauraan bharat bhi aayaa tha
 The business of his ancestors was of the Kajis
 ebn battoota aarambh se hi bada dharmanuragi tha
 He had a great desire to visit Mecca and visit famous Muslims
 is aakanksha ko puraa karne ke uddeshy se vah keval 21 baras kii aayu main yatra karne nikal padaa
 While walking, he never thought that he would get the opportunity to travel such long country longitudes
 makke aadi tirthasthanon kii yatra karnaa prayek musalmaan kaa ek aavashyak katrtavya he
 Due to this, hundreds of Muslims used to come to Mecca from different countries
 in yatriyon kii lambii yatraaon ko sulabh banane main kai sansthaayen us samay muslim jagat main utpann ho gai thim jinke dwaara in sabko har prakaar kii suvidhaayen praapt hoti thim or unka paryaton bada rochak tathaa aanandadaayak ban jaataa tha
 Due to these institutions, even the poorer "haji" from the poor were able to come to Haj from far off countries
 ebn battoota ne in sansthaaon kii baar-baar prashansa kii he
 He is extremely grateful to her
 inamen sarvotam vah sanghathan tha jiske dwaara bade se bade yatri dalon kii har prakaar kii suvidha ke liye har sthaan par aage se hi puri-puri vyavastha kar di jaati thi evam maarg main unki suraksha kaa bhi prabandh kiya jaataa tha
 Every village and town had food and snacks for their stay, food and drink
 dharmik netaaon kii to vishesh aavbhagat hoti thi
 Everywhere Sheikh, Qazi etc
 used to pay special respect to them
 islam ke bhraatrutiv se siddhant kaa yah sanstha ek jwalanth udhaaharan thi
 Due to this, the Muslims of Deshpanthars could take long and long trips without any fear
 duusari suvidha madhyakaal ke musalamaanon kaa yah praapt thim ki africa or bhartiya samudramargo kaa samoochaa vyapaar arab saudagaron ke haathon main tha
 These merchants also respected Muslim travelers equally
 ebn battoota damishq or philistin hota ek kaaravaan ke saath makka pahunchaa

 The complete set of unique traits that make up the structure and behavior of an organism is called a phenotype
 These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment
 natijatan, ek jeev ke phenotype ke kai pahaluon ko viraasat main nahin miltaa he
 For example, there is an interplay between a person's genotype and sunlight; Thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children
 However, due to differences in genotypic variation some people can tan more easily than others; a striking example, are those who are the inherited qualities of bbinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn
 anuvanshik jaankaree diene ke madhyam se ek peedi se duusare ke paas ja sakate hai, ek anu jo anuvanshik jaankaree ko encode karte hai
 DNA is a long biopolymer composed of four types of bases

 DNA sequences can be altered through mutations, creating new alleles
 yadi ek jin ke bheetar ek utparivartan hota he, to nae elil ko prabhavit kar sakate hai ki jin ke niyantran, jeev ke phenotip ko badalte hai
 However, while in some cases this simple correspondence between alleles and a trait, most traits are more complex and quantitative properties are controlled by loci

 a significant portion of phenotypic variation in the population is due to genotypic variation
 aadhunik vikasvaadi sanshleshan is anuvaanshik vividhta main samay ke saath parivartan ke rup main vikaas ko paribhaashit karata he
 The frequency of a particular allele will become more or less prevalent to other variants of that gene

 Sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of development
 yah aarekh sex kii dohari laagat ko darshata he
 If each individual were to contribute the same number of offspring, the sexual population remains the same size as each generation, where the reproductive population doubles in size for each generation
 sex kii do guna laagat pehle jon menard smith dwaara varnit thi
 The first cost is that only one of the two sexes may be young in a sexually mature species
 
 The second cost is that anyone who reproduces sexually can only give 50% of the genes to any different offspring, along with every new generation
 phir bhi eukeriots or bahukoshikeey jeevon ke bich yon prajnan prajnan ke adhik saamaanya saadhan hai
 The Red Queen hypothesis has been used to understand the importance of sexual reproduction as a means of enabling continuous development and adaptation in response to co-evolution with other species in an ever-changing environment

 It may therefore be a source of diversity that is new to the population or a species
 Gene flow may be due to the movement of individuals between different populations of organisms, as the movement of mice or grasses between inland and coastal populations
 k may be due to the movement of pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations

 Different traits provide different rates of survival and reproduction
 in lakshanon ko peedi se peedi tak paarit kiya ja saktaa he
 More offspring can be produced than survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction
 natijatan, un gunon ke saath jeevashm jo unhen apane pratidwandviyon par ek laabh de dete hai, unke gunon ko agali peedi tak un gunon ke saath paarit karne kii sambhaavna he jo ek laabh pradaan nahin karte hai
 The main concept of natural selection is the ability to develop an organism
 swasthya ko jivit rahane or punarutpaadan karne kii kshamta ke dwaara mapa jaataa he, jo agali peedi main iske anuvanshik yogadan kaa aakaar nirdhaarit karata he
 However, fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring: fitness is instead indicated by the proportion of later generations that carry the genes of an organism
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi koi jeev acchhee tarah se jivit rah saktaa he or tezi se prajnan kar saktaa he, lekin uske vanshaj bahut chote or jivit rahane ke liye kamjor the, is jeev main bhavishya kii pidiyon main thodaa anuvaanshik yogadan hoga or is prakaar kam fitness hoga
 If alleles increase fitness more than other alleles of that gene, then this allele will become more common within the population with each generation
 in lakshanon ko "ke liye chaynit" kaha jaataa he
 Examples of symptoms that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased fertility
 Conversely, this allele has less beneficial or harmful allyl consequences resulting in reduced fitness - these have been selected against "

 It can have three parts: len-denon ke likhane kii prakriya arthath vyapaarik bhaag jise pustapaalan kaha ja saktaa he
 a creative work can be called a process ie a theoretical part called accounting
 aalochanatmak kaary kii prakriya arthath vivechanaatmak bhaag jise ankekshan kaha ja saktaa he
 Earlier there was no special distinction between manual and accounting work
 parantu aaj ke audyogic yug main pustapaalan tathaa lekhankan donon pruthak kaary ho gayi hai
 Generally, the following tasks fall under the areas of manual, accounting and auditing: pustapaalan- jaisaa ki uparyukt bindu se spasht he, pustapaalan jarnal tathaa khatabahi main vyapaarik saudon ke lekhe karne kii kala he
 Any person with the simple ability to keep accounts can do this work with convenience
 yah kaary yantravat likh dena maatr he
 Accounting- According to the above point, the work of the accountant starts after the work of the bookkeeper
 isi kaaran yah kaha jaataa he ki jahaan se pustapaalan samaapt hota he, vahiin se lekhankan prarambh hota he
 In this area, the work of preparing the final accounts and making necessary errors and corrections comes from taking out the balance
 sankshep main, kaary saransh tathaa vishleshan karne kii prakriya he

 e dablyoo hanson- sampoorn lekhon kii aisi jaanch ko ankekshan kehete he jinase ki un par vishwaas kiya ja sake tathaa unke dwaara bataaye hue vivaranon par bhi vishwaas kiya ja saken
 In conclusion based on the above definitions- ankekshan kisi vyapaarik sanstha kii hisaab-kitaab kii pustakon kii vishisht evam vivechanaatmak jaanch he, jo ek yogya tathaa nishpaksh vyakti dwaara sanstha se praapt pramankon, prapatron soochnaaon tathaa spashtikarnon kii sahaayta se kii jaati he, jisase ki ankekshak ek nishchit samay ke liye banaaye hue hisaab-kitaab ke sambandh main yah report de sake ki, Institution - The audit of any institution can be done
 swatantra vyakti- ankekshan kaary kisi aise vyakti dwaara hona chahie jiskaa vyapaar athwa sanstha se kisi bhi prakaar kaa sambandh na ho
 Only then a fair investigation is possible
 at: vartmaan main chartered lekhapal kii niyukti kii gai hai
 Form of the investigation- The test conducted by the audit does not only reveal the accuracy related to mathematics, but it is an intelligent unbiased test which shows the absolute accuracy of the calculation
 lekha pustaken- ankekshan main lekha-pustakon kii jaanch hoti he
 The auditor does not have to restrict his field of work to only books, but also has to know other statutory books and various facts
 pramank evam prapatr- lekha pustakon kii jaanch pramankon evam prapatron ke aadhaar par kii jaati he, yadi yah uplabdh na hon to inaki pratilipiyon se pushti kii jaati hai
 Information and Explanation - The basis of the inquiry is the evidence itself, but if the auditor is not satisfied with the memorization certificate, then for verification of the transactions one can ask for information and clarification
 budhimattapurna- ankekshan dwaara kii jane vaali jaanch kaa kaary bahut mahatvapurn he at: is kaary main buddhi evam chaturaai kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo is kaary ke anubhav se praapt hoti he
 Purpose of checking- The purpose of checking the books of accounts is to verify the results of the profit and loss account created in a certain period and the assets and obligations shown in the letter on a certain date and give a certificate on satisfaction
 vastav main ankekshak ko antim khaaton kii jaanch par apni raay prakat kerani hoti he
 Regularity - Under the Indian Companies Act, 1956, some important rules should be kept in mind while creating the company's letter and profit and loss account
 at: company ankekshak ko apni report main likhnaa hota he ki chittha niyamaanukool he athwa nahin
 Period- Auditing is generally done for accounts of one financial year or one accounting year
 yadi ek se adhik varsh ke lekhon kaa ankekshan kiya jaataa he to yah jaanch anusandhan kehalaati he
 Result- After checking the articles, a report has to be given regarding its veracity and appropriateness
 yadi ankekshak kisi baat se asantusht he to iskaa varnan spasht rup se apni report main karata he
 As an accounting imperative, accounting in practical terms is essential to keep the business alive and to gain prestige in the society
 iske liye nimnlikhit tark diye ja sakate hai : In today's era, accurate knowledge of profit or loss from a business is not a concept without accounting
 vyavsaayee kii aarthik sthiti suddadh va aarthik saadhan bahut achche hon, to bhi anya vyavsaayee ke mukaable sasti bechney ke falswaroop bikri adhik ho lekin sirf diwaala nikalne par hi use pataa chalegaa ki usne vastu ko laagat se bhi kam main bech diya he
 There are more transactions in the business, especially where the goods are sold more on credit, it is not possible to remember the names of the debtors, so accounting is mandatory
 ek nishchit avadhi kii samaapti par laabh hua athwa haani
 Accounting is mandatory for this
 vyavsaayik lekha-pustaken yadi sucharu tareeke se rakhi jaayen to chaluvarsh kii aay-vyay yaa laabh-haani kii tulana pichley varshon ke laabh-haani se kii ja sakati he
 Through accounting, the trader gets to know his financial position
 kar-nirdhaaran main lekhon kaa bahut mahatv he
 If the accounts are kept according to the rules then these are very helpful
 ek vyapaaree ko kin-kin vyaktiyon ko kul kitna rupaya dena he, yah soochna lekhankan se hi mil sakati he
 More profit can be made by starting unprofitable actions except for non-profitable actions and if there is a deficiency in efficiency then they can be overcome by knowing their reasons
 yah kaary lekhakarm dwaara hi sambhav he
 If proper books of accounts are kept in a business, then the reputation of that business increases
 lekhankan ke nimnlikhit laabh bhi hai : ACCOUNTING LUXURY AS chote vyapaariyon ke liye ise vilasita mana gaya he kyonki inaki simit aavashyaktaaen hoti hai kintu vartmaan samay main yah purna rup se uchit prathit nahin hoti he
 Auditing as Luxury lagaana he phir bhi hisaab-kitaab main chal-kapat chhipe rah jate he, jo ankekshak uchit chaturaai va saavdhaanee ke baavjood nahin pakad saktaa hai
 Hence the audit is meaningless
 uparokt tathyon ke aadhaar par ham kah sakate hai ki chote-chote vyapaar main ankekshan vilasita he lekin sabhi vyavsaayon ke liye ankekshan ko vilasita kahana galat hoga
 Small organizations where there are one or two employees and the owner of accounting is looked after by a sole trader or partner, so auditing is not necessary, but in big business it is profitable and highly necessary, not luxury
 ankekshan kaa vilasita na hona Enhancing the efficiency of the employees - The efficiency of the employee increases as a result of the audit, because they know that an error can be detected by the auditor if the work is not done properly! karmchaariyon kii kaarykushalta main vruddhi-kushal ankekshan ke falswaroop karmchaariyon apane-apane kaary main daksh ho jate hai kyonki ankekshak samay-samay par apni report main tathaa ankekshan ke dauraan bhi kamiyon ko bataata rahata he va maargdarshan bhi karata rahata he
 Increase in efficiency of managers- When the managers know that the auditor will submit their report on the work done by them, which will be acceptable, they will do their work with full sincerity
 vyavsaay ke vikaas main sahaayak- ankekshit hisaab-kitaab par sabhi vishwaas karte hai tathaa isse vyapaar kii khyaati main vruddhi hoti he tathaa sabhi ore se vyavsaay ko suvidhaayen praapt hoti hai jisase vyavsaay kaa vikaas hota hai
 Decision in case of insolvency possible- If the books of accounts are properly conducted and audited, then the court can help in getting the debt relief order
 ho saktaa he iske abhaav main samay adhik lag jaay
 Assistants in future planning - The managers conduct comparative studies on the basis of the final accounts of several years and see how the efficiency can be increased
 plant evam mashin kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi- laagat lekhon ke ankekshan se yah maaloom hota he ki mashiinon kii kitni kaaryakshmata he tathaa kin-kin kaarnon se mashiinon kii purna kaaryakshmata kaa prayog nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Efficiency can be increased by acquiring information about these reasons
 ankekshan kii anivaaryta Auditing affects efficiency, so it cannot be called luxury
 nimnakint dashaon main yah anivaary hai – Thus it would not be completely true to say that accounting is mandatory and auditing is a luxury
 chote vyapaar main kahin-kahin lekhankan bhi vilasita he jabaki bade vyavsaayon ke liye anivaary hi he
 But still accounting and auditing are two sides of a coin
 yadi lekhankan na ho to ankekshan kiskaa hoga
 And if accounting is alone then it does not have the credibility of its veracity
 truti karnaa maanav swabhaav kaa ek bhaag hai ankekshan kaa pramukh uddeshy bhi ashuddhi va gaban kaa pataa lagaana va unhen rokna hota hai
 Checking of preliminary articles, journal checking, checking of cash balances, checking of balances of accounts, checking of account books of subsidiary books, matching of previous year's floor, finding the amount of difference, to check the auditor's errors Can take action etc
 yadi ankekshak apane kaary main itani saavdhaanee, kushalta evam budhimaani kaa prayog kare jitna ki un paristhitiyon main sammav tha or usne purna praytn kiya ho jo ki trutiyon ko dhund nikaalane hetu param aavashyak tha
 If still unable to detect fraud, the auditor cannot be held liable
 ankekshan kaary kaa arth yah kabhi nahin hota 'ki ankekshak ne ashuddhiyon evam gaban kaa beemaa kar liya he, na hi vah is baat kii garanti detaa he ki samast ashuddhiyon evam gaban ko dhund nikaalega
 He is only expected to do his work with due care and cleverness
 AAS-1 main un aadharbhoot siddhanton ke vishay main bataaya gaya he jo ankekshak ke peshewar dayitvon se sambandhit hai tathaa jinka paalan ankekshan karte samay anivaary he
 AAS-1 consists of the following fundamental principles 1 sahrudayata, vastunishthata va nishpakshta 2

 This review and evaluation show whether: ankekshan prativedan main vittiya soochnaaon par raay kii spashtatah likhit abhivyakti kaa samavesh hona chahie
 The AAS-2 "objective and Scope of the Audit of Financial Statements" states that the field of the auditor is determined keeping in view the appointment conditions, prevailing statutes, etc
 of the auditor
 vittiya vivaranon par raay kaayam karne ke liye vibhinn tareekon kaa upyog karte hue lekhankan abhilekhon va anya soochnaaon kii vishwasaneeyata tathaa paryaaptta kii jaanch kar leni chaiye
 To this end, the auditor follows such procedures to assure that the financial statements give a true and fair picture of the financial position and operating results of an enterprise
 ' The auditor, with his professional experience and decision-making ability, sets certain criteria for investigation, while doing so he cannot be expected to work outside his area of competence
 ankekshak apane kaary ko seemaa nirdhaarit kar hi kaary prarambh karata he
 There are two such limits: - Extensive limit, Intensive limit
 vistrut seemaa main ankekshak yah tay karata he ki kitne vyavhaaron ke lekhon kaa ankekshan karnaa he, jabaki gahan seemaa main yah tay karata he ki kin vyavhaaron ko gahanta se jaanchega va kitni gaharaai se jaanch kerani he

 nishpaadan ankekshan The methods of audit are such that it suffers from various inherent limitations
 at: ek ankekshak ko in arntanihit simaaon ko samajhnaa mahatvapurn hota he, kyonki uski is samaj se hi ankekshan ke sarvangin uddeshyon ke prati spashtataa praapt ho sakegi
 Limitations are as follows: - siddhanth kaa arth ek sarabhoot tathy, ek aadharbhoot niyam se he
 The principles of audit are such important truths that provide knowledge of the objectives of audit and explain the ways in which these can be met
 ankekshan va aashwaasan mandand jari kar chartered accoutents santhaan ne is or pahal prarambh kii he
 In the audit process, all those tasks are done which are adopted during any investigation under the audit principles
 ankekshan mandandon ke anusaar kriyaayein nishchit kii jaati hai
 The audit methodology includes measures that are collected as evidence required for audit and adopted to check the accuracy of the behaviors written in the accounting books
 isamen bhautik pareekshan, pushtikaran, purnaganana, mul prapatron kii jaanch, ricard se milan, sahaayak ricard kii jaanch, poochtacha karnaa, krmanusaar jaanch karnaa, sambandhit soochna se kisi mad kaa sah-sambandh bithaana, vittiya vivaranon kaa vishleshan, aadi shaamil hai
 There is a close correlation between audit methodology and procedures

 Due to this, the accuracy of articles can be proved

 After the death of his father, Zafar was made Mughal emperor on 18 September 1837
 yah digar baat thi ki us samay tak dilli kii sultanate behad kamjor ho gai thi or mughal badshaah nammaatr kaa samraat rah gaya tha
 Zafar had to pay a heavy price for playing an important role in India's first freedom struggle
 unke putron or prapautron ko british adhikariyon ne saream goliyon se bhun daalaa
 Moreover, he was taken captive to Rangoon, where he died as a prisoner on November 7, 1862
 unhen rangoon main shwadagon pagoda ke najadik dafnaaya gaya
 His burial site is now known as Bahadur Shah Zafar Dargah
 aaj bhi koi deshpremi vyakti jab tatkaaleen burma kii yatra karata he to vah jafar kii majaar par jaakar unhen shradhanjali dena nahin bhuulataa
 How much respect people had for him can be gauged from the fact that in many places in India, roads have been named after him, while in Lahore city of Pakistan, a road was named after him
 is
 bangladesh ke old dhaka shahar sthit victoria park kaa naam badalakar bahadur shah jafar park kar diya gaya he
 In 1857, when the spark of India's independence erupted, all the rebel soldiers and kings and emperors considered him Emperor of India and led them to brick by brick of the British
 angrejon ke khilaaf bhartiya sainikon kii baghawat ko dekh bahadur shah jafar kaa bhi gussa foot padaa or unhone angrejon ko hindustan se khadedane kaa aahvaan kar daalaa
 Indians defeated the British hard in Delhi and other parts of the country
 shuruaati parinaam hindustani yoddhaon ke paksh main rahe, lekin baad main angrejon ke chal-kapat ke chalate pratham swadhinata sangram kaa rukh badal gaya or angrej baghawat ko dabaane main kaamyaab ho gaye
 Bahadur Shah Zafar took refuge in Humayun's tomb, but Major Hadas captured him along with his son Mirza Mughal and Khizar Sultan and grandson Abu Bakr
 angrejon ne julm kii sabhi hadein paar kar deen
 When Bahadur Shah Zafar was hungry, the British served him in front of the plate and brought his sons heads
 unhone angrejon ko jawaab diya ki hindustan ke bete desh ke liye sir qurbaan kar apane baap ke paas isi andaaj main aayaa karte hai
 The British sent the last Mughal emperor out of the country to Rangoon to eliminate the rebellion for independence
 bahadur shah jafar sirf ek deshbhakt mughal badshaah hi nahin balki urdu ke mashhoor kavi bhi the
 He wrote a number of famous Urdu poems, many of which were lost or destroyed during the upheaval that broke out against the British
 unke dwaara urdu main likhi gai panktiyaan bhi kaaphi mashhoor hai- xxrep 4 , Ek aisa ghar chahiye mujh Ko jiski faza mastana Ho Ek kone mein ghazal ki mahfil Ek kone mein maykhana Ho
,,, His Urdu poems continued to flourish in Rangoon outside the country
 vahaan unhen har vakt hindustan kii phikr rahi
 His last wish was that he take the last breath of his life in India and be buried there, but that could not happen
 lagata nahin he ji meraa ujde dayaar main,kis kii bani he alam-e-napaayadaar main

 kitna he badanaseeb 'zafer' dafn ke liye,do gaz zamin bhi na mili ku-e-yaar main
 There are very few rulers like Bahadur Shah Zafar who love their country like Mehbooba and succumb to pardes with the promise of not getting a place in ku-i-yaar
 yahi buniyadi farq tha moolbhoot hindustani vichaardhaara ke saath jo apane desh ko apni maan maanate he
 When King Zafar breathed his last while imprisoned in Rangoon, this lion of his own famous ghazal must have been on his lips- "how much is bad luck for Zafar Dawn, two yards of land was not even found in ku-i-yaar 
 " Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal emperor to play an important role in India's first freedom struggle, is also noted as a great poet of Urdu
 unki shaayari bhavuk kavi kii bajaay deshbhakti ke josh se bhari rahati thi or yahi kaaran tha ki unhone angrej shaskaon ko takhte-landan tak hindustan kii shamsheer chalane kii chetavanee di thi
 According to public opinion, when the emperor Zafar was arrested after the first freedom struggle, an English military officer who knew Urdu said this lion while sarcastically saying - "dum dum nahi, now Khair mango ki a jafar is now sheath Is Shamsheer of India 

 !! " On this, Zafar gave a befitting reply and said - "there will be boo in Hindi when the talk of Iman, the planks will go till London

 One of the few orders he gave as soon as he became emperor was to ban cow slaughter
 is aadesh se pataa chalata he ki ve hindu-muslim ekta ke kitne bade pakshdhar the
 According to Dr
 Shailnath Chaturvedi, former Professor of History at Gorakhpur University, during the time of 1857, Bahadur Shah Zafar was such a great personality, who was respected not only as a king but also as a secular person
 isiilie behad swaabhaavik tha ki meerut se vidroh kar jo sainik dilli pahunche unhone sabase pehle bahadur shah jafar ko apana badshaah banaaya
 Chaturvedi said in conversation that making Zafar the emperor was a message to the British rulers symbolically
 iske tahat bhartiya sainik yah sandesh dena chaahate the ki bharat ke kendra dilli main videshi nahin balki bhartiya shaasha kii satta chalegi
 Bahadur Shah Zafar's order to ban cow slaughter after becoming a king was not a new order
 balki akbar ne apane shasankaal main isi tarah kaa aadesh de rakhaa tha
 Zafar had merely started following this order again
 deshprem ke saath-saath jafar ke vyaktitv kaa ek anya pahalu shaayari thi
 Not only did he encourage large Urdu poets like Ghalib, Daag, Momin and Jauk, but he himself was a good poet

 After Zafar's death, his poetry was compiled under the name "kulliyat e Zafar"

 Copernicus simplified the interpretation of motion by considering the Sun, the center of the solar family; But the first important astrological discovery was Kepler's New Laws on Planetary Motion, published in 1609 and 1619
 san 1590 ke lagbhag girte hue pindon kii gati par galileo ne ve vikhyath prayog kiye jinke aadhaar par kepler ke niyamon kii sthapana kii gai
 Keeping in mind the friction of air, he came to the conclusion that all the objects in the vacuum would fall in the same way, that is, with the same acceleration
 usne yah bhi khoj kii ki sthir chikkan samtal par sabhi pind samaan twaran se khiskate hai or yah twaran samtal ke aanati kone ke saath-saath ghatata jaataa he
 From this he concluded that the moving body would move in a straight line with a constant velocity on the horizontal plane without any obstruction
 prakshepyon ke veg ko usne kshaitij achar veg or achar twarnayukt urdhwadhar veg ke sanghatan kaa parinaam maanakar unke path kaa paravalayakaar hona siddh kar diya
 Because of these results and their vivid explanation by the Galileans, this new idea about motion took root that the acceleration of a moving body is the fraction of its speed that is determined by its constraining conditions and if it is completely free from the influence of other matter If it goes, then it will move with uniform velocity in a straight line
 yah gatisiddhant vastut: aise pind ke liye satya he jo binduvat he; kintu prayek dravya santhaan aise kanon se sangathit he jo gananaa ke liye sookshmatisookshm maane ja sakate hai

 When clocks made it known that the objects fall in different latitudes at different accelerations, he explained the reason for the earth's excursion
 usne bhanti-bhanti ke dolkon kii gatiyon kii bhi tulana kii
 In this period, due to the application of hard objects to the impact, it has been established that the mass of the objects is compared to their location based on the weight of the object
 pindon dwaara gatiparivartan ke pratirodh ko saamanytah avasthitatv kaha jaataa he
 Newton formulated the broad theory of motion, coordinating the ideas of motion prevalent in his era
 is siddhant kaa saura parivaar ke sabhi pindon ke liye anuprayog karne par jyotish tathyon kaa ucch koti kii yatharthata tak samaadhaan ho gaya or parthiv gati vigyaan kaa aadhaar, sudrudh ho gaya
 This is explained by Newton in his book called Principia
 prithvi par girte hue pidon ke twaran ke anuroop usne akashiya pindon ke bich gurutvakarshan kii kalpana kar unamem bhi twaran kaa samavesh kar diya
 According to this motion theory, the mass exhibited by location is the fundamental property of the body
 yah dravyaman sadaa aparivartit rahata he
 The mass of the celestial bodies was also calculated in such a way that their speed would be exactly matched by this principle
 newton samay kii apni maap ko nirakshep maap maanata tha
 Generally, the purpose of clocks is to give this measurement
 gatimapan ke liye newton ko ek aise aadhaar kii aavashyaktaa thi jiske saapeksh gati kii gananaa kii ja sake
 For celestial bodies, this basis is assumed to be the mass center of the solar family and the directions that do not change relative to stationary stars
 parthiv gati ke liye aadhaar kuch bhi maan sakate hai, kintu gati kii vyakhya is prakaar kii jaati he ki newton ke niyam thik baithte hai
 This base is commonly called the galactic base, and its relative speed was called Newton's ultimate speed
 gallileey aadhaar ke saapeksh ek samaan veg se, bina ghurnan ke gatiman, koi bhi aadhaar gallilia aadhaar hi he
 Just as pressure and magnetic attraction, or detraction, are the interactions between two tangent bodies, Newton also determined the law of gravity to be the reciprocal force between which two particles have an attraction force that is equal to their mass
 Is inversely proportional to the product and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
 is niyam ke anusaar gallileey aadhaar ke saapeksh sabhi twaranon kii vyakhya kanyugmon ke bich samaan or vipareet balon ke dwaara kii ja sakati he
 This rule cannot be tested in the laboratory because this force is very weak for ordinary bodies, but its astrological verification is simple
 is niyam se newton ne prithvi kaa dravyaman gyaat kiya, jo baad ke anya nirdharanon se mail khaataa he
 From this, he also obtained the movements of the solar family, the movement of the moon to the Earth, the path of comets and the movement of the axis of the Earth, the theory of equinoxes, the tidal system
 surya ke kaaran prithvi ke parit: chandrapath kshobhon kii thik gananaa ho jane par newton siddhant akatya rup se pramanit ho gaya
 Solar family verification of the Newton-theory continued until the 19th century

 Albert Einstein then explained a small error in the motion of the planet Mercury, which could not be based on Newton's theory, based on his theory of relativism
 isse 70 varsh pehle jab vaaruni ke pathakshobh kaa gyaan hua to uski vyakhya ke praytn main varuna kii khoj hui thi
 The search for such a planet was also done with great difficulty about Mercury, but it was not successful
 ant main saapekshavaad siddhant se yah sthapit ho gaya ki surya ke itane sameep path ke liye kepler kaa niyam purnat: yatharth nahin he
 The displacement of stars near the Sun derived from relativism from the observations of solar eclipse of 1817 and 1922 came true
 yahi nahin, varan yah siddhant darshanik drushtikon se bhi purnat: santoshjanak he
 Such a thing was not about the theory of gravity

 jaipur-agra rashtriya rajmarg par sthit dausa jile kaa hryday kahe jane vaale sikandra kasbe se uttar kii ore kuch hi kilometre kii duuri par sthit he, aabhaaneri gaanv
 According to the known information from the remains received by the Archaeological Department, the village of Abhaneri can be more than 3000 years old, it is located in this village "chand Bawdi"
 aabhaaneri gaanv kaa shuruuaati naam "abha nagari" tha, lekin kaalaantar main iskaa naam parivartit kar aabhaaneri kar diya gaya
 Chand Bawdi 9veen shatabdi main nirmit is baavdi kaa nirmaan raja mihir bhoj ne karavaaya tha, or unheen ke naam par is baavdi kaa naam chaand baavdi pada
 The deepest stepwell in the world is about 35 meters wide from all four sides and there are paved steps from top to bottom in this step, which can be filled easily no matter what the water level is
 13 manjila yah baavdi 70 fit se bhi zyada gahari he, jisamen bhulbhulaiya ke rup main 1300 sidhiyaan hai
 Just in front of it is the famous Harshad Mata temple
 baavdi nirmaan se sambandhit kuch kivdantiyaan bhi prachlit hai jaise ki is baavdi kaa nirmaan bhoot-preton dwaara kiya gaya or ise itnaa gaharaa isliye banaaya gaya ki isamen yadi koi vastu gir bhi jaye, to use waapas paanaa asambhav he
 This bawdi, which looks like a milky white color in the moonlight night, is also famous by the name of Bawdi of dark-light
 teen manjila is baavdi main nrity kaksh va gupt surang bani hui he, saath hi iske upree bhaag main bana hua parvarti kaaleen mandap is baavdi ke kaafii samay tak upyog main liye jane ke pramaan detaa he
 13 steps and about 1300 steps have been built to reach its bottom, which presents an unequaled example of art
 stambhayukt baramadon se ghiri hui yah baavdi chaaron ore se vargakar he
 The beautiful statues of Mahisasura Mardini and Ganesh ji on the two stoops on its lowest floor also make it special
 baavdi kii surang ke bare main bhi aisa sunne main aata he ki iskaa upyog yuddh yaa anya apatkaaleen paristhitiyon ke samay raja yaa sainikon dwaara kiya jaataa tha
 An inscription has also been found in the excavation and renovation of Bawdi, which took place about five-six years ago, in which the mention of King Chand is found
 chaand baavdi evam harshad mata mandir donon kii hi khaas baat yah he ki inke nirmaan main prayukt pattharon par shandaar nakkashi kii gai he, saath hi inaki deevaaron par hindu dharm ke sabhi 33 koti devi-devataaon ke chitra bhi ukere gayi hai
 The steps of Bavdi have been made in an attractive and artistic way and this is also its specialty that the person descending in Bavdi cannot climb back up the same step

 Being a step-well in front of the temple means that whoever enters the temple first has to wash his hands and face, and then enters the temple
 or yahi hamaare desh kii samskruti bhi he ki jo bhi vyakti kisi dharmik sthal main pravesh kar rahaa he, uskaa tan-man shuddh hona chahie
 The temple once had a statue of Harshad Mata made of six feet sapphire stone which was stolen in 1968

 It is also heard that during 1021-26, Mohammad Ghaznavi broke the temple and its premises and damaged the idols as well

 Later, it was renovated by Jaipur Maharaja in the 18th century

 {{commentary} These three steps were prepared in one night
 :- bhandarej kii baavdi raaj
 Yes, like the moon step of Dausa, this step is also said that it was made in one night
 itnaa hi nahin ye bhi kehete he ki chaand baavdi, aaluda kii baavdi or bhandarej kii baavdi tino ko hi ek raat main banaaya gaya or ye tino surang se ek-duusare se judi hai
 Poetry, poetry or poetry, is the genre of literature in which a story or emotion is artistically expressed by a language
 bharat main kavita kaa itihaas or kavita kaa darshan bahut purana he
 Its beginning can be understood from Bharatmuni
 kavita kaa shabdic arth he kaavyatmak rachana yaa kavi kii kriti, jo chhandon kii shrunkhalaaon main vidhivat baandhi jaati he
 Poetry is the syntax that makes the mind complete with any juices or impulses
 arthath vahjisamen chune hue shabdon ke dwaara kalpana or manovegon kaa prabhaav daalaa jaataa he
 In Rasgangadhar the exponent of the meaning of 'delightful' is called 'poetry'
 'arth kii romaniyata' ke antargat shabd kii romaniyata bhi samajhakar log is lakshan ko sweekaar karte hai
 But 'elegance' of 'earth' can be of many types
 isse yah lakshan bahut spasht nahin he
 Literature is the most appropriate sign of the poet Vishwanath
 uske anusaar 'rasaatmak vaakya hi kavy he'
 Ras is the soul of poetry of pleasant communication of the souls
 kavyprakash main kavy teen prakaar ke kahe gaye hai, dhwani, gunibhoot vyangy or chitra
 Sound is one in which the hidden meaning is dominant, rather than the meaning derived from the words
 gunibhoot byangy vah he jisamen gaun ho
 a picture or an ornament is one in which a miracle is done without exorcism
 in teenon ko kramshah uttam, madhyam or adham bhi kehete hai
 The poetic lighter's emphasis seems to be more on the hidden sense, not on the stimulus of the juice
 kavy ke do or bhed kiye gaye hai, mahakavy or khand kavy
 The epic canto and its hero must be a deity, king, or Dhirodatta, a rich Kshatriya
 usamen shringaar, vir yaa shant rason main se koi ras pradhan hona chahie
 Periodic compassion; Humor etc
 and juices and other people's references should also come
 kam se kam aath sarg hone chahie
 In the epic, the place of Sandhya, Surya, Chandra, Ratri, Prabhat, Mrigaya, Mountains, Forest, Ritu, Sagar, Sanyog, Vipralambha, Muni, Pur, Yajna, Ranprayana, Vivah etc
 should be imminent
 kavy do prakaar kaa mana gaya he, drishy or shravy
 Visual poetry is that which is shown by acting, such as drama, skit, etc
 which is readable and listenable, it is audible
 shravy kavy do prakaar kaa hota he, gadhy or padya
 The epic and Khandakavya of the verse poetry have been called two distinctions
 gadhy kavy ke bhi do bhed kiye gaye hai- katha or aakhyayika
 Champu, Virud and Karambhaka are considered three types of poetry and poetry
 saamanyat: sanskrit ke kavy-sahitya ke do bhed kiye jate hai- drishy or shravy
 In addition to visual poetic words, the costumes, gestures, motifs, actions and performances of the characters bring excitement to the audience's heart
 drishykavy ko 'roopak' bhi kehete hai kyonki uskaa rasaswadan netron se hota he
 Audible poetry communicates juice to the heart of readers and listeners through words
 shravyakavy main padya, gadhy or champoo kaavyon kaa samavesh kiya jaataa he
 The word 'padya', which is removed from the padma in the motion, indicates the primacy of motion
 at: padyakavy main taal, lay or chand kii vyavastha hoti he
 Again there are two strains of the verse - the epic and the Khandakavya
 khandakavy ko ‘muktkavy’ bhi kehete hai
 In the Khandakavya, instead of a complete chronicle of life like the epic, one part is described
 kavitv ke saath-saath sangitatkata kii pradhanta hone se hi inako hindi main ‘geetikavy’ bhi kehete hai
 The meaning of 'geeti' is to express the emotional spirit of the heart in a phased manner
 geeti kii aatma bhavatirek he
 The poet of his emotional sensation and imagination makes the narrative emotional
 geetikavy main kavyashastreey roodhiyon or paramparaon se mukt hokar vaiyaktik anubhav ko saralata se abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 By nature, the shape-type of lyrical poetry is smaller than the epic
 in sab tattvon ke sahyog se sanskrit muktakkavy ko ek utkrisht kavyarup mana jaataa he
 Muktakavya has become more popular than the epics
 sanskrit main geetikavy muktak or prabandh donon roopon main praapt hota he
 The best example of managerial lyricism is Meghdoot
 adhikansh prabandh geetikavy isi ke anukaran par likhe gayi hai
 Muktak is that in which each verse is independent in itself
 iske sundar udhaaharan amaruukshatak or bhatruharishtakatray hai
 Musical verses are characteristic of melodious verse lyrics
 shringaar, niti, vairaygy or prakruti iske pramukh pratipaadya vishay he
 a natural depiction of the beauty and nature of women is found in these poems
 upadesh, niti or lokvyavahaar ke sutara inamen bade hi romantic dhang se praapt ho jate hai
 This is the reason that the Suktikas and Subhashitas are found in abundance in Muktakayas
 muktakkavy kii parampara sfoot sandesh rachanaaon ke rup main vaidic yug se hi praapt hoti he
 In the Rigveda there is a reference to sending a dog named Sarma as messenger
 vaidic muktakkavy ke udaahranon main vasishtha or vamdev ke sookt, ullekhneey hai
 In the Ramayana, Mahabharata and their later texts, this type of sphincter is available in large quantities
 kadachit mahakavi valmiki ke shakodgaaron main yah bhaavana gopit rup main rahi he
 Hanuman, the messenger of Sri Rama sent to husband husbandman Pravasini Sita, Sri Krishna sent by Dharmaraja Yudhishthira towards Duryodhana and messenger Hans sent by King Nal near Sundari Dayamanti are the references counted under this tradition
 is sandarbh main bhagwat puraana kaa venugit vishesh rup se uddharaneey he jisaki rasvibhor karne vaali bhaavana chhavi sanskrit muktakkavyon par ankit he
 Rajasekhar has told in the episode of Kavicharya that the poet should take education of academics and sub-disciplines
 vyakaran, kosh, chand, or alankaar - ye chaar vidyaayein hai
 64 arts are subtexts
 kavitv ke 8 strot hai- swasthya, pratibha, abhyaas, bhakthi, vidwatkatha, bahushrutata, smritidrishta or raag
 Mammatt has stated six purposes of poetry - kavita yaa kavy kya he is vishay main bhartiya sahitya main aalochakon kii badi samrudh parampara he— acharya vishwanath, panditraj jagannatha, pandit ambikadutt vyas, acharya shripati, bhamah aadi sanskrit ke vidwaanon se lekar aadhunik acharya ramchandra shukla tathaa jaishankar prasad jaise prabud kaviyon or aadhunik yug kii mira mahadevi verma ne kavita kaa swaroop spasht karte hue apane apane mat vyakt kiye hai
 Scholars believe that the human heart wanders in the infinite form, trades of the eternal world, but when the human ego abandons the spirit and remains a pure feeling, then it becomes a free heart
 hriday kii is mukti kii sadhana ke liye manushya kii vaani jo shabd vidhaan karti ai he use kavita kehete hai
 Poetry elevates human beings from the narrow circle of selfish relationships and helps in making a raga connection with the rest of creation
 kavy kii anek paribhaashaayen di gai hai
 These definitions also hold true for modern Hindi poetry
 kavy siddh chitt ko alokik anandanubhuti karaata he to hriday ke taar zankrut ho uthte hai
 Poetry also contains the feeling of Satyam Shiva Sundaram
 jis kavy main yah sab kuch paaya jaataa he vah uttam kavy mana jaataa he
 There are two distinctions of poetry: swaroop ke aadhaar par kavy ke do bhed hai - shravyakavy evam drushyakavy
 The poetry which is praised by listening to others or reading by itself is called audible poetry
 jaise ramayana or mahabharat
 Audio poetry also has two distinctions - Prabandha poetry and Muktak poetry
 isamen koi pramukh katha kavy ke aadi se ant tak krambaddh rup main chalati he
 The sequence of the story breaks in the middle and secondary stories become helpful in between
 jaise ramcharita maanas
 There are two distinctions of management poetry - epic and Khandakavya
 1- mahakavy isamen kisi aitihaasik yaa puranic mahapurush kii sampurna jivan katha kaa adyopant varnan hota he
 These things must be in the epic - 2- khandakavy isamen kisi kii sampurna jeevanakatha kaa varnan na hokar keval jivan ke kisi ek hi bhaag kaa varnan hota he
 It is necessary to have these things in the section Poetry- isamen keval ek hi pad yaa chand swatantra rup se kisi bhav yaa ras athwa katha ko prakat karne main samarth hota he
 The songs, poets, doha etc
 are free
 jis kavy kii anandanubhuti abhinay ko dekhakar evam paatro se cathopakathan ko sun kar hoti he use drishy kavy kehete hai
 Like in a drama or a movie
 1- padya kavy - isamen kisi katha kaa varnan kavy main kiya jaataa he, jaise gitanjali 2- Prose Poetry - In this, a story is described in prose, such as Jaishankar's commission
 
 
 gadhy main kavy rachana karne ke liye kavi ko chand shaastra ke niyamon se svachhndatha praapt hoti he
 3- Champu Poetry - It consists of both prose and poetry
 maithilisharan gupt kii 'yashodhara' champu kavy he
 The history of modern Hindi poetry is about 800 years old and its beginning is understood from the thirteenth century
 har bhashaa kii tarah hindi kavita bhi pehle itivrittatmak thi
 That is, a story was tied with a rhythm and decorated with ornaments
 bhartiya sahitya ke sabhi pracheen granth kavita main hi likhe gaye hai
 The specific reason for this was that poetry was easy to memorize due to the rhythm and verses
 jis samay chhapekhane kaa avishkaar nahin hua tha or dastavezon kii anek pratiyaan bananaa aasaan nahin tha us samay mahatvapurn baton ko yaad rakh lene kaa yah sarvottam saadhan tha
 That is why at that time, along with literature, politics, science and Ayurveda were also written in the verse itself
 bharat kii pracheenatam kavitaayen sanskrit bhashaa main rugveda main hai jinamein prakruti kii prashasti main likhe gaye chhandon kaa sundar sankalan hai
 Many other subjects of life have also found place in these poems
 madurai nayak rajvansh kaa raja
 Generally speaking, prose is the language of simple practice of the person without speaking or writing
 isamen keval aanshik satya he kyonki isamen gadhykar ke rachanaatmak bodh kii avhelnaa he
 The language of ordinary behavior can also be called prose only when it is systematic and clear
 rachanaatmak prakriya ko dhyaan main rakhte hue gadhy ko manushya kii saadhaaran kintu vyasthit bhashaa yaa uski vishisht abhivyakti kahana adhik samichin hoga
 Prose is the form of simple and natural expression of man
 kavita or gadhy main bahut si baaten samaan hai
 Both have instrument words that are taken from the same repository without changing the meaning; Both the rules of grammar and syntax are the same, both resort to rhythm and pictorial dictation
 vardesworth ke anusaar gadhy or padya kii bhashaa main koi moolbhoot antar na to he or na ho saktaa he
 But despite all these similarities, poetry and prose are two different forms of expression
 samaan upkarnon ke prati bhi unke drushtikonon kii asamanta praaia: str par ubhar aati he
 But there is not only a stratigraphic or qualitative distinction between them, which is because poetry and prose are expressions of two different forms of man's mental process concerning the world and life
 unke udai or vikaas ke itihaas main iske pramaan maujuud he
 In his book Illusion and Reality, Codwell detailed the origins, social utility and technique of poetry, writing that in the earliest form of literature, poetry was the elevation of the ordinary language of man
 us kaal kavita keval ragaatmak na hokar itihaas, dharm, darshan, tantra, mantra, jyotishi, niti or bheshaj sambandhi gyaan kaa bhi vahan karti thi
 Music, verses, rhyme, volume or accentuation, alliteration, repetition, metaphor, etc
 are used to impart to him
 kalantar main sabhyataa ke vikaas, samaaj ke vargeekaran, shramavibhaajan or udbuddha saahitiyik chetana ke kaaran pehle kii unmeshpurn bhashaa bhi vibhakt ho gai—kavita ne apane ko raagon kii unmeshpurn bhashaa ke rup main simit kar liya or vigyaan, darshan, itihaas, dharamshasre, niti, katha or naatak ne saadhaaran vyavhaar, arthath kathy kii bhashaa ko apanaaya
 As per requirement, each branch developed its own method of specific style, they were exchanged and the language of ordinary behavior was also affected by them
 manushya kaa maansik jagat apane ko bhashaa ke do vishisht roopon-kavita or gadhy-main pratibimbit karne laga
 There is a deep connection between the distinction between the motives of poetry and prose, and their approach to the tools of language
 kavita kii utpatti manushya ke samuhik shram ke saath hui
 The words essentially inspired the impulse of the whole group to perform the task at one point, with the help of music and dance
 fasal saamne nahin thi, beej bona tha
 The task of the words was to inspire the whole group to sow seeds by presenting an elusive picture of the crop
 codwell ke anusaar is mayavi sristi ke dwaara shabd shakti ban jate the
 The poem was a reflection of collective sentiments and aspirations and was intended to enlighten and organize them
 isliye kavita kaa sookshm kathy-uske tathyon kii vastu-nahin, balki samaaj main uski gadyatmak bhoomika-uske samuhik bhaavon kii vastu-kavita kaa satya he
 In social life, words are not just dry symbols of the objective world, but they are associated with simple and complex emotional contexts generated by life experience
 kavita shabdon ke shuddh pratikatmak arth kii upeksha nahin kar sakati, lekin uskaa mukhya uddeshy shabdon ke bhavatmak sandarbhon ko arthpurna sanghathan he
 Poetry is a new creation of words
 herbert read ke shabdon main kavita main chintan ke dauraan shabd baar baar nayaa janm lete hai
 In many languages, the meaning of the word used for the poet is shristha
 gadhy shabdon ke bhavatmak sandarbhon ke sthaan par unke vastunishth pratikatmak arth ko grahan karata he
 In keeping with this type of use of words in prose, Herbert Reid has called prose a formative expression, an expression in which words form brick-like constructs for use around the creator
 spasht he ki shabd ke vastunishth arth or uske bhavatmak sandarbh ko purnataya vibhakt karnaa sambhav he
 This is the reason that poetry cannot be utterly insensitive and prose cannot be utterly insensitive
 kavita or gadhy kii takneekon main pasparik aadan pradaan swaabhaavik he
 But where there is no realization of their specific religions, we have visions of Slut prose instead of poetry and Slut poetry instead of poetry
 vastunishth satya kii bhashaa kehane kaa arth yah nahin ki gadhy kavita se hey he, yaa uskaa saamaajik prayojan kavita se kam he, yaa vah bhashaa kii kalashunya abhivyakti he
 In fact, many works that are beyond the power of poetry are done by prose
 bahut pehle yah anubhav kiya gaya ki kavita kii chandamay bhashaa main vichaaron kaa tarkmay vikaas sambhav nahin
 Recognizing the distinct power of prose even in a less developed state of poetry, Aristotle in his famous treatise Retoric called it the realization of perception, the language to impress others with his thoughts, the main elements of which are rational order of thought, liveliness of description, Imagination, pictorial, spontaneity, rhythm, personification, utterance-beauty, ooze, moderation
 inamen se prayek bindu par kavita or gadhy kii seemayen milti hui jaan padati hai, kintu donon main inke prayog kii alag alag reetiyaan hai
 For example, their two elements, rhythm and pictogram, can be taken which are discussed a lot
 gadhy kii lay main kavita kii lay se adhik loch yaa vividhta hoti he kyonki gadhy main lay vakyarachana kii nahin balki vichaaron kii ikai hoti he
 Often in poetry
 lay ko vakyarachana kii ikai banaakar punrariti se prabhaav ko tivrata di jaati he
 Rhythm in prose is more pronounced than poetry
 praaia: lay ke madhyam se hi gadhykar ke vyaktiv kaa udghaatan hota he
 The life of poetry settles in the picture, while in prose, it is used to illuminate the idea with the utmost restraint
 angreji gadhy ke mahaan shailikar swift ke vishay main dow janson ne kaha tha : yah dusht kabhi ek roopak kaa bhi khatra mol nahin letaa
 The main thing is that all the capabilities of language in prose are subject to infallible expression of thought
 kavita main bhashaa ko alankrita karne kii swatantraaa aksar shabdon ke prayog or vakyarachana ke prati asaavdhaan rahane kii pravriti kaa kaaran he
 The misuse of adjectives is not in prose as much as it is possible in poetry
 kavita main sangeet ko aksar sasti bhavukta kaa aavaran bana diya jaataa he
 The importance of the story in prose works on it
 isaliye gadhy kaa anushaasan bhashaa ke rachanasaundarya ke bodh kaa uttam saadhan he
 T
 S
 In Elliot's words, the qualities of good prose are the first and least requirement of good poetry
 gadhy kaa prarambh itihaas, vigyaan, saundaryashasre ityadi kii bhashaa ke rup main hua
 Later he moved from art to art
 roopon ke vikaas ke aadhaar par uski teen sthool kotiyaan bani hai-varnanaatmak, jisamen katha, itihaas, jeevani, yatra ityadi aate hai
 Critical, which includes Science, Esthetics, Criticism, Philosophy, Religion and Ethics, Law, Politics, etc
, and affective, which includes subjective essays and dramas in addition to many of the above topics
 vishyon ke anusaar gadhy main pravaah, spashtataa, chitramyata, lay, vyaktigat anubhuti, alankaran ityadi kii matraaon main her pher kaa hona aavashyak hai, kintu gadhy kii kotiyon ke bich deevaaren nahin khadi kii ja sakati
 According to the interest and purpose of the writer, they are inserted into each other
 aadhunik yug main upanyaas gadhy kii vishesh prayogshaala ban gaya he
 Poetry remains on the path of words for a long time, prose has the amazing power to digest all kinds of new, old, dry smooth words
 bonami dabri ke anusaar sara acha jivit gadhy prayogtmak hota he
 The novel can make full use of this ability of prose
 aise prayog england kii apeksha america main adhik hue hai or vinium livis, hemingve, steen, fahonor, andersan ityadi ne apane prayogon ke dwaara angreji gadhy ko nayaa rakt diya he
 The power of rapid change in prose can also be estimated from the rapid development of Hindi prose, although its history is not very old
 bhavishya main gadhy ke vikaas kii or sanket karte hue ek angrej aalochak midilaton mari ne likhaa he : gadhy kii vistaar seemaa anant he or shaayad kavita kii upeksha uski sambhaavnaaon kii kam khoj hui he
 Rani Mukerji is an Indian actress best known for her performances in Bollywood films
