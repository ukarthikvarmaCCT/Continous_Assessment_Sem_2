 Siddhantakomudi is more popular than Ashtadhyayi
 ashtaadhi ke sutron kaa kramparivartan karte hue upyukt sheershakon ke antargat ekatra kiya gaya he or unki vyakhya kii gayi he
 Thus Siddhantakomudi is more systematic and can be understood easily

 Bhattojidixit has attempted to present the all-round form of Paniniya grammar according to the procedure, while reviewing the Sutra chronological interpretations of Kashika, Nyas and Padam Zari, etc
 and the views of Karkumudi and its commentaries
 unhone aavashyaktaanusaar paribhaashaon, vaarttikon tathaa bhashyeshtiyon kaa bhi ullekh kiya he
 He has shown the harmony of the conscience of the monks and has established some self-opinion on the basis of the Mahabhashya

 In the medieval era, Siddhantakamudi was so much publicized and spread that the ancient methods of Panini grammar and the grammatical methods like Mugdbodh were dissolved

 Bhattajidishtha occupies an important place in Paninian grammar

 It is beginning to be understood that Siddhantakomudi is not only the door to the great language, but is a brief but vivid essence of the great language

 jab tuko pani lekar lautataa he to paata he ki carsan mar chukaa he or blondi carsan ke mrit sharir ke bagal main gaadi ke sahare jhukaa hua padaa he
 Before dying, Blondie states that Carson has given him the name of the grave
 tuko blondi ko ek catholic mishan le jaataa he jo tuko ke bade bhai padri peblo dwaara sanchalit kiya jaataa he
 Tuco recovers Blondie's care, and the two leave in disguise
 galati se unka saamana union ke sainik dal se hota he 
 unhen pakad kar ek sangheey jail shivi main le jaaya jaataa he
 At the camp, the protagonist Wallace makes an appearance
 tuko bill carsan ke sthaan par uttar detaa he, jisase angel aaiz kaa dhyaan uski ore aakarshith hota he, jo us samay shivi main tainaat sangheey padaadhikari ke bhesh main he
 Angel Eyes commands Wallace to brutally beat and torture Tuco, telling him the address of Sad Hill Cemetery as a secret place to sleep, but Tuco also tells him that only Blondie is the tomb
 Knows the name
 angel aaiz sone kaa pataa lagane main blondi ke saamne barabari ke hisse kaa prastaav rakhata he
 Blondie gets ready and walks off with Angel Eyes and her troop
 isi bich, tuko jise nayak vailes ne baandhakar rakhaa he, use faansee ke liye train dwaara duusare sthaan par le jaaya jaataa he
 During this trip, Tuco tells Wallace that he has to pee and keeps Wallace's attention on the other side for so long that he can catch Wallace and jump from the train
 He then beats Wallace on a rock, causing him to die and cutting the chain when another train arrives, which leads to the train dragging the dead Wallace along and Tuco is freed
 iske baad ham dekhte hai ki blondi, angel aaiz or angel aaiz kii tukdi ek aise shahar main aati he jise vishaal top ke hamalon ke kaaran bahut shighratapurvak khaali karavaaya ja rahaa he
 Tuco was also wandering among the ruined remains of the same city, now completely forgotten about the man who caught the prize criminals who survive the beginning of the film, he chases Tuco and an abandoned During a bath in the building, he suddenly attacks
 chaunkane ke baavjood, tuko goli chalaata he or inami aparaadhiyon ko pakadaney vaale us vyakti ko maar daalata he
 Blondie investigates the shot fired, during which he finds Tuco and tells him about the intervention of Angel Eyes
 donon punah apni saajhedaari ke anusaar kaary karne lagate hai, dhwast shahar main chup-chup kar ghoomte hai or angel aaiz ke gundon ko maarthe hai, ab tak unhen yah nahin pataa chalaa tha ki angel aaiz bhaag chukaa he or un donon ke liye ek apmanjanak patr chhod gaya he
 Tuco and Blondie find their way to Sad Hill Cemetery, but are blocked by the vast Union and Union forces, only a narrow bridge between Union and Union forces
 prayek paksh iske liye ladane kii taiyaari kar rahaa he, lekin spashtatah donon hi pakshon ko yah ajna di gayi he kii pul ko nasht nahin karnaa he
 Thinking that if the bridge is destroyed, "these idiots will go elsewhere for the fight", Blondie and Tuco lay the dynamite on the bridge with the help of wire
 While doing so, the two reveal their information to each other, Tuco states that the place where the gold is buried is Sad Hill Cemetery and Blondie states that the tomb under which the gold is named is Arch Stainton
 phir jaise hi vah pul dhwast hone vaala hota he, vah donon chup jate hai or senaayen punah yuddh karne lagati hai
 The next morning, the Union and Union soldiers are gone
 tuko blondi ko swayan hi kabristaan se sona nikaalane ke liye chhod detaa he 
 paaglon kii tarah, kabron par asthaayee rup se lagaaye gaye yaadgaar pattharon va nishaanon ke us samudr main talash karne ke baad antat tuko ko arq steinton kii kabr mil jaati he
 When he makes a dent there, Blondie comes and throws a spud towards him
 ek kshan baad, donon angel aaiz ko dekhakar chaunk jate hai, jo unhen bandook kii nok par roak letaa he
 Blondie kicks Stanton's tomb by foot, and all they see is a skeleton
 yah bataate hue ki bas wo hi asli kabr kaa naam jaanata he, blondi vah naam kabristaan ke binchobich ek chattan par likh detaa he or tuko or angel aaiz se kahata he ki "do sau hazaar dollar bahut badi rakam hoti he
 We have to earn it
 " teenon kabristaan ke golakaar centre main ek duusare ko ghoorte hai or achaanak waar karne se pehle parasiddh 5 minute ke mexican standoff ke dauraan yah anumaan lagaate hai ki koun kiskaa saath de saktaa he or kya khatre ho sakate hai
 Blondie shoots at Angel Eyes, who, while bending back, tries to shoot Blondie but Blondie shoots at him again and falls into an open tomb while he is dead
 tuko bhi angel aaiz par goli chalaane kii koshish karata he, par paata he ki blondi ne pichhali raat ko hi uski bandook kii goliyaan nikaal di thim
 Blondie takes Tuco to the tomb called "unknown" which is right next to Arch Stainton
 tuko us kabr ko khodta he or uske andar sone ke thilon ko paakar bahut khush ho jaataa he, lekin jab vah palatakar blondi kii taraf dekhtaa he to ek latakate hue fande ko dekhakar hairaan rah jaataa he
 To avenge what Tuco had done to him, Blondie forces him to stand atop a trembling grave stone and puts the noose around his neck, before taking his share of gold
 He ties Tuco's hand
 jab tuko dayaa kii bheekh mangate hue chillaata he to, blondi kii akruti phir se dikhaayi padane lagati he or vah tuko par ek rifl kaa nishaanaa saadhe hue tha
 Blondie drives the gun just once and breaks the noose rope, just like he used to before, before Tuco falls face down on his part to sleep
 tuko ke paas apane hisse kaa sona to he par ghoda nahin he, isliye vah gusse main bura bhala kehete hue chillaata he "he blondi! to blondi muskuraataa he or chalaa jaataa he
 You know what you are The child of a lowly bitch! " ! baat mat karo
" Following the success of For a Few Dollars More, United Artists managers approached the film's screenwriter, Luciano Vincenzoni, in connection with a contract to obtain the rights to his next film
 nirmaataa alberto greemaldi or cerigo leone kii aisi koi yojana nahin thi, lekin unke aashirwad ke saath, vincenjoni ne is film kaa vichaar rakhaa jo "teen aise badmaashon ke bare main he jo america grihayuddh ke dauraan kisi khajaane kii talash kar rahe hai
 "the studio agreed to the idea but wanted to know the cost of this next film
 isi samay, greemaldi apane bhi ek vichaar kii dallali karne kii koshish kar rahe tha lekin vincenjoni kaa vichaar adhik laabhkar tha
 Together, the two confirmed an agreement with the UA for a budget of one million dollars, according to which the studio would give $ 500,000 in advance and a 50 percent stake in the business outside Italy
 The total budget eventually became $ 1
3 million

 People were killed

 "the Battersville camp where Blondie and Tuco were held captive was based on Andersenville's steel carvings
 film ke kai drishy mathew brady dwaara liye gaye puralekhiy chitron se prabhavit hai
 While Leon gave Vincenzoni's idea a story, the same screenwriter recommended that the comic-writing team of Aizenor Inkruchi and Furio Scarpelli work with Leon and Serigo Donati on the film
 According to Leon, "I could not use even a single word written by him in my film
 yah mere jivan kaa sabase bada dhokhaa tha
 "donati also agreed, saying," His contribution to the final story was nil
 unhone sirf pehla bhaag hi likhaa tha
 Just one line, that's all
 "vincenzoni claims that he wrote the screenplay in 11 days, but he soon left the film due to a deteriorating relationship with Leon

 He is a heart-touching character with his wounded humanity and tenderness

 This was changed just before filming began when Vincenzoni got the idea for II Buono, Il Bruto, Il Cativo, which Leon liked very much

 Eastwood recalls that, "if you are working on a story about Spain and the Spaniards, they will certainly pay attention to your work
 Then they will do a very thorough investigation of you, but the fact that you are a Western film Is being made in Rome which should have been made in Southwest America or Mexico, then he will investigate more about your story and subject
 " Top Italian cinematographer Tonino Daly Coulee was brought in to film the film and was encouraged by Leon to pay more attention to the lighting in the film than the previous two films; The music was once again composed by Enino Morricone
 leone kabristaan main hone vaale antim mexican stand of drishy ke liye mauricon se ek aisi rachana kaa anurodh karne main sahaayak siddh hue jiske bhav is prakaar hon, "laashen apane kabron ke bheetar se hans rahi thim" or unhone daily kauli se kaha ki mantrmugdh kar dene vaala ghumaavdaar prabhaav paidaa karen jisame bich-bich main naatakeey najdiki filmakan bhi ho, jisase darshakon ko drishy ballat ke prabhaav jaisaa anubhav ho
 Initially Eastwood was not happy with the story and was concerned that Wallach might fade his character and he told Leon, "I was the only one in the first film
 duusari main do vyakti the
 There are three people here
 yadi aisa hi chalata rahaa to, to agali film main mai america fuj ke saath kaam karata hua paaya jaaoongaa
" jaisaa ki eastwood is bhoomika ko sweekaar karne ke liye saralata se nahin maan rahe the, eastwood ko punah rath marsh, jo unase trikon kii teesri film ko sweekaar kar lene kaa anurodh kar rahe the or wiliam mauris agency va irving leonord, joki clint par marsh ke prabhaav ke kaaran dukhi the, ke madhya prachaar sambandhi vivaadon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 eastwood ne marsh ko apane karier ko or adhik prabhavit karne par pratibandh laga diya or unhen frank wales dwaara bheje gaye ek patr ke kaaran marsh ko apane vyapaar prabandhak ke pad se hataane ke liye vivash hona padaa
 kuch samay baad tak, eastwood kaa prachaar sambandhi kaary gatman and palm ke jeri palm dwaara dekha ja rahaa tha
 Wallach and Eastwood went to Madrid together and between filming scenes Eastwood relaxed and practiced his golf swing
 filmakan ke dauraan vailaach ko ek prakaar se jehar hi de diya gaya tha jab unhone galati se ek tezaab kii bottle pi lee thi jo ek film takanisian dwaara unki sode kii bottle ke bagal main rakh di gayi thi
 Wallach referred to it in his autobiography and complained that while Leon was an outstanding actor, on the other hand he was very lax about ensuring the safety of his actors during the filming of dangerous scenes
 udahaaran ke liye, ek drishy main, jahaan unhen ek pistaul ke chalane ke baad faansee par latakaaya janaa tha, aise main unke neeche khadey ghode ko goli kii awaz se chaunk kar bhaagna tha
 When Valach's neck cord split, the horse was horrified at the sound of the pistol
 vah lagbhag ek mile tak uchhalata hua daudta rahaa or vailaach ab bhi uski peeth par hi baithe the saath hi vailach ke haath bhi unke peeche kii ore bandhe hue the
 The third time Wallach's life is in danger, he and Mario Braga - who are chained together - jump from a moving train in the scene
 train se kudane vaala bhaag to yojana ke anuroop hi puraa hua, lekin vailaach kii jaan tab khatre main pad gayi jab unke dwaara abhinit charitra us chen ko alag karne kaa prayaas karata he jiske dwaara vah vafaadaar gunde se bandhe hue the
 Tuco places the corpse on the railway tracks and waits for the train to come and pass over it so that the chain breaks apart
 Wallach and possibly the entire film production team were clueless about the heavy iron ladder that exited each box car
 yadi vailaach galat samay par apni jhuki hui avasthaa se uth jate, to shaayad ubhari hui sidhiyon main se ek unhen bedhad kar detii
 The bridge was rebuilt twice by excavators from the Spanish army, even after being repaired to blast the explosives on camera
 pehali baar, ek italian camera sanchaalak ne yah sanket diya ki vah filmakan ke liye taiyaar he, jise ek sena ke captain dwaara spanish shabd "shuru" ke rup main galat samaj liya gaya kyonki is donon shabdon kii dhwani ek hi saamaan thi
 Luckily, no one was injured in this bad weather

 Leon had said that his scene was, in part, inspired by Buster Kitton's silent film, The General
 chunki antarrashtriya paatro ko film main liya gaya tha, isliye sabhi abhinayta apni maatrubhaasha main kaam kar rahe the
 Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach spoke English and their dialogues were dubbed in Italian for the film's first performance in Rome
 america sanskaran ke liye, sheersh paatro ke hi swaron kaa prayog kiya gaya tha, lekin sahaayak abhinaytaon ke sanvaadon ko angreji main dab kiya gaya tha
 The result is visible on the screen as a bad harmony between the movement of the lips and the tone; None of the dialogues are in complete harmony as Leon rarely filmed the scene with synchronized vocals
 iske liye kai kaaran bataaye gaye: leone praayah kisi bhi drishy ke parshv main mauricon kaa sangeet chalaanaa pasand karte the or sambhawatah abhinaytaon ko drishy ke bhav main laane ke liye kuch kuch chillaate bhi rahete the
 Leon paid more attention to visuals than dialogue
 Due to the technological limitations of the time, it would have been difficult to record the sound clearly in the extremely long scenes that Leon often used
 Also, silent filming and then dubbing of dialogues was a standard practice in Italian films at the time
 vaastavik kaaran jo bhi rahaa ho, film ke sabhi samvaad nirmaan ke baad record kiye gaye the
 Relations between Eastwood and Leon had been tense since the time of their previous collaboration, and the relationship deteriorated further during sessions dubbed dialogues for the US version, as the actor had the original article on which to film Another article was replaced in his place
 unhone is nae sanskaran se samvaad padhane se inkaar kar diya or filmakan ke dauraan prayukt aalekh se hi samvaad padhane kii baat par ad gaye
 Leon was unable to find any real cemeteries for the filming of Sad Hill Cemetery, so the Spanish fireworks chief hired 250 Spanish soldiers to build a cemetery in the Causej, near Salas de los Infantes He had completed the work in two days
 film ke ant tak eastwood leone ke uttamtavaadi nirdeshkeey gunon se ukta chuke the, jo praayah jabaran, kai konon se drishyon ke filmakan par jor daalate the or nimna se nimna muddon par bhi bahut dhyaan dete the; jisase abhinayta praayah buree tarah thak jate the
 Leon, who was a heavy eater, was also a source of entertainment due to his extreme habits, and Eastwood used to calm his tensions by making fun of him and nicknamed him "yosemite Sam" because of his bad nature
 Which caused them to be guided under Leon's patronage
 eastwood ne tay kar liya tha ki vah dobaaraa leone ke nirdesan main kaam nahin karenge, isiilie baad main unhone vans apon a time in da west main hormonica kii bhoomika ko thukraa diya tha, jisaki kahani unhen dene ke liye leone swayan los angels aaye the, antat yah bhoomika charles brusnan ko de di gayi
 Years later, Leon took his revenge on Clint during the filming of Once Upon a Time in America, when he described Eastwood's talent as his ability as an actor to resemble a piece of marble or wax and Robert Far less than De Niro's acting ability, his comment was, "eastwood is a sleeping man in the midst of explosions and gunfire
" b move like he is always the same - like a block of marble
 Bobby first an actor, Clint first of a star

 " da good, da bed and da agli ko sanyukt rajya main disambar 1967 tak jari nahin kiya gaya tha
 The original domestic Italian version was 2 hours 57 minutes long; But the international version was 2 hours, 41 minutes, ie 16 minutes shorter

3 million
 da good, da bed and da agli ko iske hinsaatmak drishyon ke liye aalochana mili thi
 Leon explains that "the murders shown in my film are exaggerated because i wanted to create a satirical sarcasm for run-of-the-mill Westerners

 In a negative interview with The New York Times, critic Rinetta Adler stated that the film would "be the most expensive, paganism and hateful film in the history of its bizarre genre
" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that "the Good, the Bad and the Ugly which has now been shown at the urban level, the temptation to call it The Bad, the Dal and the Interminable is extremely strong and so Only because this film is like this
 " roger abert jinhine baad main film ko apni great movies kii suchi main sthaan diya tha, vah punarawalokan karte hue kehete hai ki apni mul samiksha main unhone "is film kii vivechna ek 4 sitara film ke rup main kii thi lekin ise maatr 3 sitare hi die the, shaayad isliye kyonki yah ek pashchimi spegati thi or isliye yah kala film kii shrenee main nahin aa sakati thi
 'ebert also points to Leon's specific approach that helps viewers get closer to the characters because the audience can see what the characters see
 Sergio Leone established a rule that he follows throughout The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
 The rule is that the ability to see is limited by the sides of the frame
 At important moments in the film, what the camera cannot see, the characters cannot see, and that gives Leone the freedom to surprise us with entrances that cannot be explained by the practical geography of his shots
 There is a moment, for example, when men do not notice a vast encampment of the Union Army until they stumble upon it; a moment in a cemetery when a man materializes out of thin air even though he should have been visible much sooner; the way men walk down a street in full view and nobody is able to shoot them, 
 Today, the film is considered an excellent film by many critics

 Neha is thrilled to see him in Ooty but comes closer to the ailing Bannu instead of Raja
 chijen bhadda mode leti hai jab gafoor bunnu ko maarane kii koshish karata he
 But he escapes
 raja ko raste se hataane ke liye bunnu hatyara pappu pager se sampark karata he
 However, that plan fails

 Both are surprised to see the other there

 The presentation, language and location of the advertisement should be such that people must have an eye on it
 aisa na hone par vah apane uddeshy main safal nahin ho paaegaa
 Be it advertisements published in magazines or magazines or presented through hoardings etc
, its decoration should be so original that it automatically draws the eyes of the people towards it
 saamaanya se alag kuch vishesh aakarshan hona vigyaapan kii shartan he
 The main feature of the product or item being advertised should be in the advertisement, so that there is no hindrance in establishing a perception among the people
 mukhya baaten yaa kendriya bindu ko aadhaar banaakar vigyaapan aadhik tarksangat tathaa prabhavi banaaya ja saktaa he
 The agency that makes the advertisement should create an advertisement that is literate for all, educated and illiterate, urban and rural
 jis vigyaapan ko samajhane main darshak ko dimag lagaana padegaa uske prati vah judaav mahasoos nahin kar paaegaa
 In such a situation when people will not understand it, how will we move towards using the product? vigyapandaata ko chahie ki vah jis utpaada ko vigyaapit karnaa chahta he usase jude tamaam tathyon ko kramvaar prastut kare
 In fact, the need to create an advertisement was realized only because it is not attracted to anyone who does not need it
 tathyon kii tarkpurna prastuti se log vigyaapan ke prati khulaapan mahasoos karte hai
 The ad must have the quality to speed up the thinking of the viewer or the reader even when it is stationary
 iske liye usamen gatyaatmak sanket hone aavashyak hai, jisase vigyaapan jahaan samaapt ho, dekhne vaala uske aage ko sochakar uske upyog ke liye apana man banaae
 The ad title should be attractive

 saamaanya rap se upabhokta athwa janata paramparik rap se jis vastu kaa upyog karti aayi he use chhodkar nayi vastu ke prati usamen andeh bana rahata he
 Through advertising, interest is generated in the consumer towards the new product produced
 keval vastu hi nahin, utpaadankarta, vastu kii upyogita tathaa uske gunon kii jaankaree dene kaa kaarybhi vigyaapan karata he
 In this way, the consumer has the option of comparing similar items, differentiating their prices, etc
 through advertising and he selects and uses his convenience to buy it
 vigyaapan se keval upabhokta kaa hi laabh nahin praapt hota balki use bechney vaale dukandaar arthath vikreta ko bhi laabh praapt hota he
 The ad seller makes the task so easy that he does not have to repeatedly tell the consumers about the new item
 sachai to yah he ki vigyaapan vastu ke saath hi saath vah kahan-kahan uplabdh he, isaki jaankaree muhaiyaa karaata he
 Hence, both consumers and sellers benefit from advertising
 vigyaapan ke madhyam se nayi vastua ke utpaadan tathaa uski upyogita kii jaankaree di jaati he jisase upabhokta kaa dhyaan us vastu ke istemaal kii ore kendrit hota he
 This is how advertising creates the market

 Today Hindi is taking a new look according to the requirement of advertisement
 vigyaapan ke anusaar hindi bhashaa main nit-naye prayog ho rahe he
 Due to this, language is developing and Hindi is becoming a living language of new times and society, not just the language of books
 prayek bhashaa kii apni bhashaa samskruti hoti he
 His vocabulary, syntax, idioms etc
 are special
 hindi kaa bhi apana bhashaa sanskaar he
 In the present form of advertising, the status of renunciation of traditionalism and acceptance of modernity can be seen
 usamen keval utpaadak, utpaadit vastu or upabhokta hi nahin aata, balki jansanchaar ke sabhi madhyam or yatayat ke saadhan bhi aate hai, ye sabhi vigyaapan ke prasar main sahaayak hote he
 The use of Hindi verbs creates the ability to say more in advertisements

 radiyon main jahaan dhvanyatmak shabdon kaa mahatv hota he vahiin televijan tathaa cinema main drishyaatmak kriyaapadon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For example, if an advertisement like 'apply Boroline' is printed to keep the skin soft on frosty days, then for radio - words like 'remove frosty sweetness Boroline', but Doordarshan and audio-visual
 Visuals in mediums such as' Have you seen? Did you know? Etc
 words are used
 vigyaapan ko aarthik vikaas ke liye dekha ja saktaa he, kai log vigyapanon ke saamaajik lagat par bhi dhyaan dena chaahate he

 dandi - dand dhaaran karanevaale sanyasi kaa roodharth
 Dharmashastra texts like Manusmriti give the characteristics of punishments and the rules of their penance
 yon to apni antim avasthaaon main varnashram dharmanusaar sabhi dwijon ko teen ashramon main rah chukne ke baad sannyast hone kaa vidhaan or adhikaar tha, kintu dandi sanyasi keval brahman hi ho saktaa tha
 He too was allowed to be punished only for the absence of parents and wife
 vaastavik sanyas sansar ke sabhi bandhanon or sambandhon ko tod dene se hi sambhav tha or dandi sanyasi uskaa pratik hota tha
 The goal of renunciation was to attain salvation and spiritual salvation; worldly salvation was essential
 yahi kaaran tha ki dandi ke liye atyant kathor lakshan nishchit kiye gaye or kathin taapas jivan hi uskaa maarg mana gaya, yatha -- niraamish bhojan, nirpekshata, akrodh, aadhyatmarati, atmaparakta, grihatyag, siddharthatv, asahaaytv, angnitv, paribrajaktv, munibhavatv, mrityu se bhayheenata, du:kha sukh main samaan bhav, bastiyon main keval bhiksha ke liye janaa, sansaarik maamalon se dur rahanaa ityadi
 His daily life also had its order
 mahabharat ke anusaar dandi ke upree lakshan the -- dand dhaaran karnaa, sir ke baalo ko ghutaye rahanaa, kushasan kaa prayog, chirawasan or mekhaladhaaran
 Thus, after 12 years of obeying the rules, Dandi used to throw his punishment and become a paramahaà¤‚à¤¸sa
 chunki dandi sanyasi brahmanvarna se aate the, ve praaia: yogya vidvan hote the or yada kada log unase padhane bhi jaaya karte the
 In time, Dandi became a sect of ascetics who often started filling up with the communal persons of Shankaracharya

 "furthermore, a study by the alleged NFPA by the State of California A&M and the City of Palo Alto California expresses that," electromagnetic alarms reacted more slowly to fires that spread faster than ionizing alarms
 , But laboratory and field tests have shown that electromagnetic smoke alarms are sufficient for all types of fires Of the individuals who do and give them warning seen very rarely disable them
 " Although optical alarms have been highly effective in detecting smoldering fires and provide adequate protection from blazing fires, fire safety experts and the National Fire Protection Agency recommend installing combination alarms, which are alarms that are either Detects both heat and smoke or uses ionization and electro-optical / optical processes
 sinsinati vishvavidhyalay dwaara kiye gaye ek snaatak anusandhan adhyayan ke anusaar, vidyut prakaashiya alarmon main pareshaani paidaa karne vaale alarm paidaa karne kii bahut kam sambhaavna thi, ve sulagane vaale aag kaa pataa lagane main behatar hai evam ve dadhakati aag kaa pataa lagane main bhi utane hi prabhavi hote hai

 Alpha radiation, unlike beta and gamma, is used for two additional reasons: Alpha ears are ionized, so large amounts of air particles will be ionized to maintain current and have low penetrating power, ie They will be intercepted by the plastic and / or air of the smoke detector

 The traditional term is a slang used to describe the difference between the method used to make contact with a control unit and the unconventional methods used at the beginning by addressable detectors
 niyantran ikai dwaara tathakthith "paaramparik detectaron" kii vyaktigat rup se pahchaan nahin kii ja sakati he or ve apni jaankaree kshamta main ek bijli ke switch samaan hote hai
 These detectors are connected in parallel to the signaling path or starting device circuit in order to notify the closure of the circuit path by a connected detector when smoke or other similar environmentally stimulating object greatly affects a detector
 The flow of can be monitored
 The resulting increase in stream current is interpreted as a confirmation of the presence of smoke by the control unit and is processed and produces a fire warning signal
 is prakaar kaa instolation kisi pranali main shaamil prayek detector ko ek vyaktigat sankhya yaa pataa detaa he
 Thus, addressable detectors enable fire extinguishers by a FACP to obtain the exact position information of an alarm indicated on a diagram

 In Britain it is estimated that more than 30% of smoke alarms may have dead batteries or batteries fired
 parinamswaroop, smoke detector badariyon ko niyamit rup se badalane ke sambandh main logon ko yaad dilaane hetu saarvajanik soochna abhiyaan taiyaar kiya gaya he
 For example, in Australia it is advertised that all smoke warning batteries should be replaced on the first day of April each year
 In regions where time is used to save time by forwarding the clock, these campaigns can suggest that people change their batteries when they change their clock or on their birthday
 kuch detectaron ko lithium bydaree ke saath bhi bechaa ja rahaa he jo 7 se 10 varshon tak chal sakate hai, haalanki yah vastav main logon ke dwaara badariyon ko badalanaa kam hi sambhav kar saktaa he, kyonki unhen badalane ki kabhi-kabhi jarurat hoti he
 By that time, the entire detector may need to be replaced
 haalanki apekshaakrit mahange, upyogkarta dwaara badale jane yogya 9 volt vaali lithium batariyaan bhi uplabdh hai
 Common nimh and nicd rechargable batteries have a high automatic discharge rate that makes them unsuitable for use in smoke detectors
 yah satya hota he yadhyapi charge karne ke thik baad, jaise ki portable sterio main istemaal kiye jane par ve kshareey badariyon kii tulana main bahut adhik shakti pradaan kar sakate hai
 Also, one problem with recharging batteries is the rapid decrease in voltage at the end of their useful charge
 yah un upkarnon jaise ki smoke detectaron main chintaa kaa vishay he, kyonki bydaree itani teji se "aaweshit" se "mrit" ho saktaa he ki detector se kam-bydaree sambandhi chetavanee avadhi yaa to itani choti hoti he ki un par dhyaan nahin diya jaataa he yaa ve bilkul hi utpann nahin hoti hai
 The NFPA recommends that homeowners replace smoke detector batteries at least once per year with a new battery when it starts chirping or when it fails to check, which the NFPA alarms each month
 But it is recommended to press the "check" button at least once a month

 By the mid-2000s, development had begun in the field of wirelessly networked smoke alarms using technologies such as zigbee to easily reestablish a building without connecting expensive wires to interconnected alarms
 Will grant permission
 Many wireless systems using wi-safe technology will also be able to detect smoke or carbon monoxide through detectors, which together alarm themselves through vibrating pads, strobe and remotely used warning handsets
 Will start giving Since these systems are wireless, they can be easily transferred from one location to another
