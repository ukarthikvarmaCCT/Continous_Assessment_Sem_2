 ilats of lengerhans agnyashay ke vah kshetra hai jinamein antahsravi koshikaaye hoti hai
 The islets of Langerhans, discovered by the German pathologist Paul Langerhans in 1869, contain some 1 or 2% of the volume of the pancreas
 swasth vayask manushya ke agnyashay main kuch 10 lakh ilet hote hai jo ki puure ang main faile hue hote hai; inaki kul maatra 1 se 1
5 gram hoti he
 The hormones produced by the islets of Langerhans are secreted directly into the bloodstream by five types of cells

 Islets can affect each other via paracrine and autocrine communication, and beta cells are also electrically connected to other beta cells
 lengrhans ke ilet kii paracrine pratipushti pranali kaa yah dhaanchaa he: The electrical activity of pancreatic cells has been studied by patch clamp techniques and it has been found that the behavior of cells in monolithic islets is quite different from the behavior of dispersed cells

 Another source of beta cells, such as islets derived from adult stem cells or progenitor cells of a diabetic, may reduce the tightness of donors' organs for transplantation
 punarjanan chikitsa kaa kshetra kaafii tezi se viksit ho rahaa he or nikat bhavishya main kaafii aashaaen de saktaa he
 However, type 1 diabetes is caused by the autoimmune destruction of beta cells in the pancreas
 atah ek prabhavi upachaar ke liye krambaddh, samikrut vidhi apnaani hogi jo ki upyukt va surakshit swapratirodhi avrodh or beta koshika punarjanan donon kaa hi khyal rakhe
 Islet cell transplantation is likely to bring back beta cells and treat diabetes, which is another option rather than complete pancreas transplantation or artificial pancreas
 ilinoy vishvavidhyalay ke chicago chikitsa centre main mukhyalayit chicago pariyojna yah koshish kar rahi he ki beta koshikaaon ko "in vivo" hi punarjanit kiya jaae
 It is worth noting that apoptosis occurs early in beta cells and is destroyed in the normally functioning pancreas

 When activated, the pander blocks beta cells in s phase leading to apoptosis

 The sino-nepal War or the gorkha-china War was an ascendancy over Tibet by the Nepalese in 1788â1792
 yah yuddh puri tarah nepali or tibeti armiyon ke bich sikaa ke vivaad ko lekar ladaa gaya
 Coins made by Nepalese by mixing a mixture of cheap metals, which had been a problem for Tibet for a long time
 nepaliyon ne tibetiyon ko vash main kar rakhaa tha, jo china ke adhin thea
 Tibet made treaty of Kerala and promised an annual salute in accordance with peace agreement
 baad main tibet ne jhooth bolaa or china ke raja ko nyauta diya
 Commander Fukagan set fire to Betravati in Nepal, but due to the tremendous counter attack, China accepted the proposal for peace settlement
 nepal ke mall rajvansh ke samay se hi tibet main nepali chaandi ke sikkon kaa chalan tha
 When Prithvi Narayan Shah closed the economic transactions in the Kathmandu Valley during his unification period, then Jai Prakash Malla, the king of Kathmandu faced a huge economic crisis, to overcome this crisis, he replaced copper with another metal
 Tried to make low-level coins
 baad main prithvi narayan shah ne 1769 main safalataa purvak kathmandu ghati par kabja kar liya or puri tarah se nepal main shah rajvansh ko sthapit kar liya, unhone pun: shuddh chaandi ke sikkon ko chalan main laana shuru kar diya
 But by then the confidence in Nepali coins had been lost
 tibetiyon kii maang thi ki un sikkon ko shuddh chaandi ke sikkon ke saath badla jaae jo pehle hi chalan main aa chuke the or shuddh chaandi ke nahin the, yah ek aisi maang thi jo naye sthapit shah vansh ke liye bahut bade weetiya vitt ghate kaa sauda thi
 Prithvi Narayan Shah was not responsible for this and was not willing to bear such a huge loss, but he was willing to have credibility for the purity of the new silver coin
 is prakaar do tarah ke sikke bazaar main chalan main thea
 This issue continued unabated until the end of 1775 and this problem was passed on to successive rulers of Nepal
 
1788 main prithvi narayan shah ke bade putr bahadur shah or unke chachaa or rajya-pratinidhi rana bahadur shah ko sikke kii gambheer samasya viraasat main mili
 On the plea of fake coins, Tibetans started spreading rumors that Nepal was in a position to attack; And the Tibetans living in Tibet started harassing Tibet

 At that time, salt used to come from Nepal only from Tibet
 nepal se ek pratinidhi mandal is vivaad ko sulajhane ke liye tibet bheja gaya tha, lekin pratinidhi mandal kii maang ko tibet ne nakaar diya
 In this way Nepal had no desire to have relations with Tibet and Nepal attacked Tibet from many directions
 
 In 1789, Bahadur Shah sent a Gorkha soldier to Tibet under the joint leadership of Damodar Pandey and Bam Shah
 gorkha sainik kuti ke raste tibet main pravesh kiyen or tashilhunbo tak pahunch gayi
 a fierce team fought at Shikarjong where Tibet had to give up badly
 tab tesu lamas or shakia lamas ne gorkha dal se shanti vaarta ke liye anurodh kiya
 The Gorkha party then released them and proceeded towards Kuti and Kerung
 jab china ke samraat ne yah suna ki gorkha sainikon ne tibet ke upar hamalaa bol diya he to general chanchu ke nirdesh par chini sainikon ki ek badi tukdi bheji gai
 General Chanchu himself came to the Tibetan Lama to take stock of the situation
 usne nishchay kiya ki jab tak yah vivaad sulajh nahin jaataa vah yaheen rahegaa
 Representatives from Tibet and Nepal met in Kerung in 1790 for peace talks
 is vaarta main yah natijaa niklaa ki is jhagade kaa jimmedaar tibet tha ou isliye yuddh main hue kshati kaa harajaana bhi tibet hi bharegaa or sammaan harajaane ke rup main tibet salaana nepal ko 50,001 rupaya bataur degaa or nepal bhi yuddh main arjit kiye gayi kshetra ko tibet ko waapas de degaa
 The Nepalese representative was given Rs 50,001 by Tibet as a first payment so that her regained area would be returned to them
 or nepal ne tibet kaa kshetra - kerrung, kuti, longa, jhunga or falak unhe waapas kar diya
 But this condition of the Treaty of Tibet could not last long
 usne dusre saal main hi harjane ke 50,001 rupee dene se inkaar kar diya
 And this refusal became the leader of nepal-tibet War 2
 jaise hi tibet ne harjane ke 50
001 rupee dene se inkaar kar diya vaise hi bahadoor saah ne abhimaan singh basnet ke netritv main sainik ki ek tukdi kerrung bheja or duusari tukdi damodar singh ke netritv main 1791 main kuti bheja
 Damodar Pandey attacked Digarcha and took possession of the king's property
 usne lhasa ke mantri dhorin kaaji ko bhi bandi bana liya or use lekar nepal waapas laut aayaa
 As the news arose in the ears of the Emperor of China, he sent a large team of soldiers under the leadership of Phukagan, which had 70,000 soldiers in defense of Tibet
 is prakaar 1792 main nepalâtibet yuddh chinaânepal yuddh main badal gaya
 Emperor King asked Nepal to give back the Tibetan property looted at Digarcha to Tibet
 unhone shamarpa lamas jo nepal ke sharan main tha ko bhi waapas dene ke liye kaha
 But Nepal refused to meet this demand
 samraat king ke shahi senaaon ne miletry pratikriyon dwaara nepal ko uttar diya
 The King's soldiers continued on the banks of the Trishuli River until they reached Nuwakot
 nepali sena ne king sena ke akraman par dhaava bolne ki koshish ki lekin, ve pehle hi visham paristhitiyon kaa saamana kar chuke thea
 There was a huge loss on both sides
 or chini senaaon ne gorkhaleeyon ko waapas nepal ki rajdhani ke kareeb bhitari tarai tak khadeda
 Although a detailed defeat could not get the Gorkhali army back
 usee samay nepal do or jagahon se miletry shaktiyon kaa saamana kar rahaa tha
 The Sikkim nation had started an invasion of Nepal from the eastern border, on the other side, Nepal was constantly on its own border with Garhwal in the far west, the states Acham, Doti and Jumla were openly rebelling against Nepal
 is prakaar bahadoor shah ko china ke samraat king se bachaav karne main nepal ko bahut mushkil kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa tha
 Anxious King Bahadur Shah asked the British for 10 Howitzer mountain guns
 general crik patric kathmandu pahunchaa, par usne hathiyaar ke badale ek aise sandhi ko sweekaar karne ke liye kaha jiske anusaar angrej nepal main apana vyapaar karnaa chaahate thea
 Wow, the British were smart, weapons were not taken from the British and war situation became very fragile for Bahadur Shah
 kramash: ek ke baad ek ladaai main safalataa ke baad, chini senaaon ko ek bahut hi mukhya ghatana kaa saamana karnaa padaa jisase unhe waapas pichhe hatane ke liye majabur hona padaa jab ve betravati nadi jo nuvakot main gorkha mahal ke paas he paar karne ki koshish kar rahen thea varsha ritu main badhit nadi pani se labalab bharaa hua tha
 As the Chinese army reached south of the Betravati river near Nuwakot, it was becoming very difficult for the Nepalese army to wait for them at Kathmandu
 19 sitambar 1792, jab chini sena betravati nadi ke kinare aaraam kar rahi thi tab nepaliyon ki lagbhag 200 se bhi kam sankhya vaali sena ne jeetpur fedi jahaan sainikon kaa padaav tha par pratiakraman kar diya
 The Nepalese forces adopted a tactic, they lit the torch in their hands and walked towards their camp
 vahaan unhone mashaal ko ped ki shakhaon se bandha or jalati hui mashaal jaanwaron ke singh se band kar dushmano ki ore dauda diya
 In this way the King's army was defeated and thus Nepal did not suffer much damage
 ek gatirodh to ubhar hi aayaa tha or pashchimi seemaa par kam yaa ubharate anischitata par ve kitne der tak apane yukti se abhiyaan jari rakh pate isliye gorkhaliyon ne china ke shart par ek sandhi par hastakshar kiya jisamen duusare maang ke saath ek maang yah bhi tha ki har paanch saal par nepal china ko sammaan bhugtani bhi bhejega
 
 king kamander general phukaagan ne nepal sarkaar ko ek prastaav bheja jisamen shanti sandhi ke anumodan ke liye kaha gaya tha
 Bahadur Shah himself also wanted to have cordial relations with China
 vah prastaav sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar ho gayi or 1792 main betrawal main maitri sandhi kaa nishkarsh nikaala gaya
 The treaty had the following conditions: is yuddh ke turant baad tibet china ke adhin aa gaya jabaki nepal phir bhi swytt or swatantra rahaa
 During the 19th century, the Qing dynasty was weakened in such a way that it also ignored this treaty
 udhaaharan ke liye, nepal-angrej yuddh 1814-16 ke dauraan, jab british east india compani ne nepal ke viruddh yuddh ki ghoshnaa ki, tab vah us sangharsh main apane samant ki madad karne main hi naakaam na rahaa, valki vah nepali kshetra british dwaara chhinane se bhi bachaane main naakaam rahaa
 Similarly, the Second nepal-tibet War was conspicuously absent in 1855â56

 yema, yah jine austen dwaara likhit romance ke galat arthon se paidaa hone vaale sankaton ke bare main ek upanyaas he
 The novel was first published in December 1815
 apane anya upanyaason kii hi tarah, is upanyaas main bhi austen england ke jorgian-regency main rahanevaali kuleen mahilaon ke jivan kii mushkilon or chintaaon kaa anveshan karatin hai; saath hi ve apane paatro ke zariye ek sajiv 'shishtachar-prahasan' bhi prastut karatin hai
 Before starting the novel, Austen wrote, "I am going to choose a heroine whom no one but myself would like most
" In the very first sentence, he introduced the title character as "beautiful, clever and rich Emma Woodhouse"
 By the way, Emma is quite a spoiled girl, who thinks herself very capable in 'matchmaking'; And ignores the troubles that come from interfering with other people's lives, often misinterpreting the actions of others
 haalanki yema woodhouse kaa vishwaas he ki vah khud kabhi shaadi nahin karegi, lekin haibari gaanv main rahane vaali yah bees-varshiya naasamajh ladki machameking kii apni kshamta ko prakritik dein maanati he
 The marriage of his governance was done by Mr
 Vidhu, a widower of the village
 After succeeding with Weston, Emma takes up the task of finding a suitable life partner for her new friend Harriet Smith
 haalanki heriyet ke mata-pita ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin he, phir bhi yema kaa maananaa he ki heriyet ek sajjan kii patni hone kii haqadaar he or isliye vah apni saheli ko gaanv ke purohit mi
 alton se mail-milaap badhaane ke liye protsaahit karti he
 Meanwhile, Emma convinces Harriet to turn down the relationship from the rich farmer Robert Martin, although Harriet must have some feelings for the farmer
 yema ke protsaahan se heriyet mi
 alton par mugdh ho jaati he, lekin yema kii yojana par pani phir jaataa he jab alton zaahir karte hai ki ve heriyet se nahin balki yema se pyaar karte hai
 Emma then realizes that in the tune of finding a life partner for Harriet, she misses the truth of the situation
 yema ke bahanoi or gahare dost mi
 naytle, yema ke machameking ke prayaason ko badi aalochanatmak nazar se dekhte hai
 They believe that Mr
 Martin is a worthy bridesmaid whom it would be a privilege for Harriet to marry

 naytle hi zyaada samajhadaar sabit hote hai
 Elton leaves the city of 'bath', saddened by Emma's rejection and Harriet's own level, and marries a young girl almost immediately

 weston ke suputr, frank churchill ke charitra ke bare main utsukata jagaati he
 Frank is eager to meet his father in Highbury, following the upbringing of his maternal uncle in London - who has adopted him as his heir
 apni maami kii bimariyon or shikayaton ke kaaran apane pita se milane se vanchit frank ke bare main yema kuch nahin jaanati
 mi
 naytle ko turant noujvaan yuvak par andeh hone lagata he, khaaskar jab frank keval apane bal katwane ke liye hadabadi se landan waapas jaataa he
 But Emma finds Frank happy and notices that Frank is attracted to her
 haalanki vah is aakarshan ko hatotsahit karnaa chaahati he, phir bhi vah is noujvaan yuvak kii khushamadi se khush hoti he or uske saath ishkabaazi karti he
 Emma welcomes Jane Ferfax, the new member of the Highbury faction, with little enthusiasm
 jine sundar or susanskrit ladki he, par uske mitbhaashi hone se yema use naapsand karti he or, varnan-karta kaa sanket he ki vah jine se irshyaa karti he
 Then begins a series of doubts, intrigues and misunderstandings
 mi
 naytle jine kaa bachaav karte hue kehete hai ki vah dayaa or sahanubhuti kii haqadaar he kyonki yema kii tarah uski apni koi dhan-sampatti nahin he or bahut jald use gavarnes kii naukari ke liye ghar chhod kar janaa hoga
 Mrs
 Weston suspects that Mr
 His romantic feelings are behind the affection shown in this defense of Naitley, which Emma opposes
 har koi maanane lagata he ki yema or frank ke bich lagaav bad rahaa he, par jald hi yema frank ko apane sambhavya premi ke rup se khaarij karti he or use heriyet ke liye yogya pati ke rup main dekhne lagati he
 In a village celebration, Naitley, Mr
 Alton and his newlywed wife get approval from Emma to dance with Harriet, who was recently humiliated
 agle din, frank heriyet ko gypsy bhikhaariyon se bachaata he
 When Harriet tells Emma that she is in love with a man who is above her own social status, Emma realizes that her point is towards Frank
 naytle ko andeh hone lagata he ki frank or jine ke bich koi rahasyamay baat he or vah yema ko sachet karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 Emma laughs off Naitley's suggestions and loses Naitley's approval over her flirtation with Frank and insults Jane's aunt - kind, unmarried, Miss Bates - on a picnic
 or jab naytle yema ko daantate hai to vah ro padati he
 Then comes the news that Frank's maternal uncle has died and an unexpected mystery unfolds from this incident, which gradually reveals all the differences
 darasal frank or jine ne chupake se sagaai kar lee hoti he or frank apni asli chahat ko chupaane ke liye yema kii ore aakarshith hone kaa naatak karata he
 After Mami's death, with the consent of his maternal uncle, Frank can now marry his beloved Jane
 yema chintit ho jaati he ki isse heriyet tut jaayegi, par jald hi use pataa chalata he ki darasal heriyet frank ko nahin balki naytle ko pasand karti he
 And Harriet believes that Naitley has the same love feelings for her
 heriyet ke is khulaase se yema khud ko ashaant or du:khee mahasoos karne lagati he or apni is vyathaa se use ehsaas hota he ki darasal vah khud naytle se pyaar karti he
 Emma hopes that Naitley herself tells him that he loves Harriet, but does not happily budge when Naitle expresses her love for Emma
 Harriet is soon relieved when Robert Martin once again proposes to her the marriage which she accepts

 Emma Woodhouse, the heroine of the story, is a 21-year-old, handsome, passionate, intelligent and 'little-known' headdress
 jab vah bahut choti thi tabhi uski maa kaa dehanth ho gaya or apni badi bahan kii shaadi ke baad, vah nishchit rup se ghar kii malkin ban baithi
 haalanki vah kai myanon main apni umr se kahin zyaada samajhadaar he, phir bhi yema kuch gambhir galatiyaan karti he jiskaa kaaran he uskaa drudh vishwaas ki vah hameshaa sahi hoti he or vaastavik duniya main anubhav kii kami
 haalanki usne kasam khai he ki vah khud phir kabhi bhi shaadi nahin karegi, lekin dusron ke liye jivan saathi chunane main use bahut kushi milti he
 She finds herself unable to fall in love with someone, but when she is jealous she realizes that she is always Mr

 He is a close friend of Emma and also her only critic, though she also has a deep affection for him

 martin ke prastaav ko thukaraane ke liye raji karti he yah sochakar ki isi main heriyet kaa faaydaa hoga
 He warns Emma that she is Harriet and Mr
 Forget Elton's idea of getting married, since his guess is that Mr
 Alton has a high opinion of himself
 unhen frank churchill or uske iraadon par shaq hota he, haalanki unke shaq kii buniyaad kaa mukhya kaaran he navayuvak kii irshyaa, lekin unka sahaj-bodh sahi sabit hota he jab yah baat saamne aati he ki frank churchill jaisaa dikhataa he vaisaa he nahin
 Mr
 Frank Churchill, Mr
 His son from Weston's previous marriage is a sociable and smart young man except Mr
 Everyone else likes Naitley
 mi
 naytle use bahut naasamajh maanate hai haalanki unki is raay kaa kaaran he frank ke prati unki irshyaa, kyonki frank yema kaa aashiq banakar uskaa 'peechha' kiya karata tha
 After the mother's death, Frank was raised by his rich maternal uncle and he named his name as his surname
 frank ko naach-gaanaa bahut pasand he or vah jivan kaa puraa-puraa anand lene main vishwaas rakhata he
 Frank may seem a carefree person, but Mr
 Austen's other novels such as 'pride and Prejudice'
 Is far less characterless than villainous characters such as Wickham or Willoughby of 'sense and Sensibility'
 jine pherfaques, ek anaath ladki he or uske parivaar main hai keval uski buaa, miss bets or daadi, mises bets

 But his misfortune is that he does not have any special property, so he has to do a government job even if he does not want to

 At the very beginning of the novel, Emma keeps Harriet under her care and Harriet is the target of Emma's misguided attempts at matchmaking
 shuru-shuru main heriyet kisaan robert martin ke shaadi ke prastaav ko nakaar detii he kyonki yema kaa maananaa he ki martin heriyet se neeche darje kaa he, haalanki heriyet ke apane purvaj yaa khandaan kaa koi ata-pataa nahin he

 Ann Weston, formerly Miss Taylor, was Emma's governess for sixteen years, and in the first chapter itself
 She is still a close and reliable friend after her marriage to Weston

 Often others find it very difficult to keep up with them because they always get upset over trivial matters and make things difficult and understand that other people will be upset in the same way, even they Guests also refuse to serve rich food

 yema woodhouse austen kii pehali heroin he jise paison kii koi chintaa nahin or iskaa zikr vah bholi-bhali miss smith se karti he ki isiliye use shaadi karne main bhi koi dilchaspee nahin he
 This is different from Austen's other novels, as marriage and economic security have often been important themes in his other stories
 yema ke paas paryaapt dhan-sampatti hone kii baat is upanyaas ko, austen ke 'cens and sensibility' or 'pride and prejudis' jaise upanyaason kii tulana main, kaafii halkaa-phulka bana detii he
 In contrast, Jane Ferfax's future looks somewhat blurred
 austen kii anya heroinon kii tarah, yema par romantic aakarshan kaa koi asar nahin padataa
 sahi aadmi ke saath ghar basaane se pehle galat vyakti kii ore aakarshith hone vaali marian dashawood kii tarah, yema apni zindagi main aane vaale mardon main koi romantic dilchaspee nahin dikhaati

 colins ke prati
 frank churchill ke prati uski chahat, sahi myne main romantic pyaar kii laalasaa nahin balki jivan main ek chote se rochakamay daur kii taras darshata he
 It is worth noting that Emma does not recognize the love that develops between Harriet Smith and Robert Martin and considers future spouses only on the basis of wealth and social ambitions
 jab heriyet smith mi
 naytle ke prati apni bhavanaaen prakat karti he tab jaakar yema ko mi
 naytle ke prati apni khud kii bhaawanaaon kaa ehsaas hota he
 Although Emma is different from Austen's other heroines, in one thing, Elizabeth is similar to Bennett and Ann Eliot in that she is a smart and intelligent woman who has neither work nor work to do
 She has the ability to change her routine or her place
 haalanki use parivaar kaa sneh praapt he or aarthik suraksha bhi, phir bhi yema kii rozmarra kii zindagi sachmuch badi neeras or ubaau he; upanyaas ke shuru main, uskaa koi saathi nahin he jo uski hamaumr kaa ho
 Despite the inefficiency in matchmaking, the tune it carries is a symbol of silence against a narrow woman's narrow range of life, especially when the woman is lonely and childless

 Instant messages are often stored in a local message history, thus making it consistent with e-mails of a consistent nature
 instant messaging internet kaa purvavarti he, jo sabase pehle 1960 ke dashak main bahu-prayokta oparating pranali jaise ki sitis evam multics main upasthit hua
 Initially, some of these systems were used as notification systems for services such as printing, but were soon used to facilitate communication with other users logged into the same machine
 jaise-jaise networkon kaa vikaas hua, networkon ke saath protocolon kaa bhi prasar hua
 Some of these used parallel protocols, while others needed a friend group to connect to the server (see)
 During the incident of the bulletin board system that reached the peak during the 1980s, some systems incorporated conversational features that were similar to instant messaging; The freelancing roundtable was a prime example of this

 Through modern, Internet, customers today known as gui-based messengers, Pauwau, ICQ and AOL began work with instant message senders in the mid-1990s

 The term "instant messenger" is a service mark of Time Warner and cannot be used in software unaffiliated with AOL in the United States
 is kaaran se, instant messaging graahak jinhen pehle game yaa gim ke rup main janaa jaataa tha, ne april 2007 main ghoshnaa kii ki unhen nayaa naam "pidgin" diya jayega

 ye sab vishesh rup se us company kii seva ke saath kaary karte hai, haalanki kuch anya sevaaon ke saath simit kaary kii anumati bhi pradaan karte hai
 There are also third-party customer software programs that will be integrated with most major instant messaging services

 These are all tasks that a small business needs, but larger organizations will need more sophisticated programs that can work together
 The way to find capable applications for this is to use the enterprise version of instant messaging applications
 isamen exempipi, lotus semtime, microsoft offis communicator aadi jaise sheershak shaamil hai jo aksar anya interprise anuprayogon jaise ki karypravah pranaaliyon ke saath ekikrut hote hai
 These enterprise applications or enterprise application integrations are built up to a few limitations, ie storing data in a common format

 Typically, a dedicated corporate IM server has many benefits such as a pre-filled contact list, consolidated authentication, and improved security and privacy
 kuch networkon ne aise bahu-network vaale iem graahakon dwaara unka upyog rokane ke liye parivartan kiye hai
 For example, Trillian had to use a number of modifications and patches after its users made changes to these networks to access MSN, AOL and Yahoo networks
 Major IM providers usually cite the need for a formal agreement to bring about these changes, as well as the reasons for security concerns
 swaamitv sambandhi protocol ke upyog kaa taatpary yah rahaa he ki kai twarit sandesh preshan praaroop ko bahut mahangaa padaa he
 Mobile instant messaging is a technology that allows access to instant messaging services from any portable device, from standard mobile phones to smartphones

 The language has become universal, translating famous statements such as 'lol' as a face-to-face language

 However, some people try to express the emotional expression on IM more accurately

 This important word in Vedic literature is used in the Rigveda Samhita to mean song or mantra
 'gai' dhaatu se nishpann hone ke kaaran geet hi iskaa vyutpattilabhya tathaa pracheenatam arth prathit hota he
 Despite the achievement of the word Gath, the use of the word Akarant is popular
 gaatha shabd se bane hue shabdon kii satta iske bahul prayog kii soochika he
 Gathani is used for the person who leads a song
 rujugath shuddh rup se mantron ke gayan karanevaale ke liye tathaa gathin keval gayak ke arth main vyavahrut kiya gaya he 
 Although its aforesaid general meaning is largely intended, it has a more specific meaning in this mantra of the Rigveda, because here it is classified with Narashansi and Rabi: yah sahavargeekaran ruk samhita ke baad anya vaidic granthon main bhi bahush: uplabdh hota he 11

 12) There is a difference of opinion among scholars regarding the meaning of these three words
 bhashyakaar sayan ne in teenon shabdon ko atharvaveda ke katipay mantron ke saath samikrut kiya he
 20th episode of Atharvaveda, 12th mantra saga of 127th Sukta; 1-3 mantras of the same Sukta, Narasanshi and 4-6 mantras are also mentioned
 isi sameekaran ko doctor oldenberg rugveda kii drushti main doshapurn maanate hai, parantu doctor bluemfield kii drushti main yah sameekaran ruk samhita main sweekrut kiya gaya he
 The practice of the Brahmin Samhita sheds considerable light on the character and nature of the saga
 aitarey brahman kii drushti main mantron ke vividh prakaar main gaatha maanav se sambandh rakhti he, jabaki rich dev se sambandh rakhata he
 That is, the saga is a different and different mantra from being human and Ritch being divine
 is tathy kii pushti shun:shape aakhyaan ke liye prayukt shatgatham shabd se paryaaptaroopen hoti he, kyonki shun:shape ajigart rishi kaa putr hone se maanav tha jisaki katha rugveda ke anek sookhton main di gai he
 The number of mantras of these suktas is around one hundred, so in the eyes of Aitareya Brahmin, the word saga is clearly used for the mantra signifying human and human subjects
 aitarey aaranyak gaatha ko rich tathaa kumbya se bhinn tathaa pruthak mantra kaa ek prakaar maanata he jisase gaatha ke padhyabaddh hone kaa paryaapt sanket miltaa he
 From the point of view of the subject of the Varna, though religious due to the expression of the subjects related to religion, the ritual literature of the Vedas is said to be unholy compared to the Rach Yajusha and the Saman, meaning that these spells are not considered in this era
 maitrayani samhita kaa kathan he ki vivaah ke samay gaatha anand pradaan karti he or grihyasutron main anek gaathaayen di gai hai jinhen vivaah ke shubh avasar par veena par gaaya jaataa tha
 In the context of Aitareya Brahmana's Aandra Mahabhisheka, many ancient gems have been cited in praise of famous kings who are given huge sacrifices in the Yajna and anointed by specific priests, which are also available in the story of the Puranas
 shatapath brahman main bhi aisi daanparak gaathaayen surakshit hai
 In the previous era, saga and Narasanshi rhyme often came to be considered synonymous, but basically there is a separation between the two
 gaatha gey mantron kaa saamaanya abhidhaan he jiske antargat narashansi kaa antarbhaav maananaa sarvatha nyaayay he
 This fact is confirmed by the commentary of Aitareya Aranyak
 sayan ne yahan praat: praatar anrutan te vadanti kii gaatha kaa udhaaharan diya he jo spashtat: narashansi nahin hai
 The language of the saga is different from the language of Vedic mantras
 isamen veda ke visham vaiyaakaran roopon kaa sarvatha abhaav he tathaa padon kaa sarleekaran hi sfoottatya abhivyakt hota he
 It is clear from certain examples of the saga: yah mantra prasiddh kutaap sookhton ke antargat aayaa he, parantu isaki style tathaa varshya vishay kaa prakaar ise gaatha siddh kar rahe hai
 In the saga associated with Bharata, son of King Dushyant in Aitareya Brahmin: yahan ye shloke naam se abhihit hone par bhi pracheen gaatha main hai jo parampara se praapt hoti puraanon tak chali aati he
 How many such gathas have been cited in Brahmin texts
 jain dharm tathaa buddha dharm main bhi mahavir tathaa gautam buddha ke upadeshon kaa nishkarsh upasthit karanevaale padya gaatha naam se vikhyath he
 Jain stories are in Ardhamagadhi and Buddhist stories in Pali language
 inako ham un mahapurushon ke mukhodagaat saakshaat vachan hone ke gaurav se vanchit nahin kar sakate
 The Tathagata's popular collection of similar ecclesiastical gathas is the Dhammapada and the gems that summarize the story of the Jatakas are usually available at the end of each Jataka
 sanskrit kii aryaa ke samaan pali tathaa praakrit main gaatha ek vishisht chand kaa bhi dyotak he
 In the saga of Theragatha and Therigatha, we find a compilation of the poignant sensations of ther and therias, who spend their whole lives abandoning the worldly indulgence

 'swatantry koti' kaa upyog kai kshetron main hota he, jo neeche diye gayi hai- Hindi Movement In India, there are special efforts to bring Hindi and Devanagari in various social fields
 yah bharatendu harishchandr ke samay armbh hua
 Litterateurs and social workers had a special contribution in this movement
 bharatendu ke samay main hindi kii sthiti badi vikat ho gayi thi
 The British used to promote the minorities according to their 'divide and rule' policy
 ve hindi ke raah main tarah-tarah ke rode atakaate the
 Urdu-loving litterateurs considered the new Hindi a great danger for themselves
 iske atirikt hindi ke roodhiwaadee sahityakar puraani kavy-paramparaon se chipke hue the
 He was indifferent to the development of prose in modern Hindi
 bahut se logon kaa vichaar he ki musalamaanon ke bharat aane se nayi bhashaa 'urdu' kaa janm hua
 It's not like this
 musalamaanon ke bharat aane se kisi nayi bhashaa kaa janm nahin hua
 No new language is born by approaching two religions
 musalamaanon ne europe par bhi akraman kiya tha or saikadon varshon tak unase ladaai kii thi kintu vahaan kisi nai bhashaa kaa janm nahin hua
 The entry of Muslims into India started from the eighth century but 'urdu' came to the end of the eighteenth century and the boycott of the words of the dialects of the dialects came at a time when the British grip on India was getting stronger
 kisi ek hi dharm ke maanane vaale ek hi bhashaa bolen yah bhi aavashyak nahin
 Arab, Iran, Turkey are the three Muslim countries, but the languages of the three are not only different, but belong to three different families
 jab ham yah vichaar karen ki bharat main musalamaanon ke aane se vahaan kii bhashaaon evam samskruti main kya parivartan hue, to ye prashn avashya poochna chaiye - ye musalmaan kahan ke nivasee the? inaki maatrubhaasha kya thi? dilli main shashan karne vaale musalmaan na irani the na arab
 The separation of Hindi from Urdu was necessary because Urdu had deliberately separated itself from the tradition of native words used by Kabir, Tulsi, Sur, Meera, Rasakhan etc
 
 There are two aspects of Matrukat - one is left with many popular words called 'ganwaru', and the other is borrowed only from arabic-persian for high cultural vocabulary
 bangala, marathi, telugu ke vipareet urdu main sanskrit kaa tiraskaar hota rahaa
 All the Arabic words in Urdu were not included in the rule of the Muslims as they came under the British rule
 'urdu alag jabaan he', 'majahab ke aadhaar par bhi comen banatin hai' - ye vichaar angreji raaj main hi prachaarit kiye gayi, musalamaanon ke shasankaal main nahin
 How would the people of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar meet their cultural needs? Leaving or leaving the leaks of all Indian languages? By adopting the Persian script, considering the continuation of matrukat and boycotting Sanskrit vocabulary? yadi patna, dilli, ujjain ke vishaal trikon main hindi aandolan na chalaaya jaataa; yadi yahan farsi-lipi or farsi-arabi ke shisht shabd lene kii niti ko maan liya jaataa to yah niti keval yahan kii janata ke liye hi nahin, varan samast desh kii janata ke liye ghaatak hota
 Instead of going ahead with Bangla, Marathi and Telugu, the vast Hindi-speaking region would push them back, hindering their progress, stopping their development
 bharatendu kaa yah ugantakaari mahatv he ki unhone apane pradesh ke saanskrithik aavashyaktaaon ko pahachaanaa; unhone hindi ke liye sangharsh kiya; saamaajik-saanskrithik jivan main uskaa vyavhaar sudruth kiya; matarukat kaa silsilaa khatm karke unhone hindi ko usee maarg pabadhane kii prerana di jis par bangala, marathi, telugu aadi pehle se hi bad raheen thim
 The development of Hindi was necessary and inevitable for our national life
 vishaal hindi pradesh kaa saanskrithik vikaas urdu ke madhyam se sambhav na tha
 In 1928, Khwaja Hasan Nizami translated the Quran into Hindi, he told in the role that most Muslims of North India know Hindi, not Urdu
 bharatendu ne jo hindi aandolan chalaaya vah musalamaanon ke liye bhi upyogi tha na keval hinduon ke liye; thik usee tarah jaise bankimachandra chattopadhyaay or rabindranath thakur kii bangala-seva hindu-musalmaan sabake liye thi

 The helplessness of marriage and then the father of many daughters continued to contribute to making their struggling life more difficult as soon as they became adults themselves

 eklavya mahabharat kaa ek paatr he
 He was the son of Nishad named Hiranya Dhanu
 eklavya ko apratim lagan ke saath swayan sikhi gai dhanurvidya or gurubhakti ke liye janaa jaataa he
 After the death of his father he became the ruler of the Shringaber state

 According to the legend mentioned in the Mahabharata, Eklavya came to Dronacharya's ashram for the purpose of learning archery, but being a Nishadputra, Dronacharya did not accept him as his disciple
 niraash ho kar eklavya van main chalaa gaya
 He made an idol of Dronacharya and started practicing archery by considering that idol as Guru
 ekagrachitt se sadhana karte huye alpakaal main hi vah dhanurvidya main atyant nipun ho gaya
 One day the Pandava and Kaurava princes along with Guru Drona went for hunting to the same forest where Eklavya was practicing archery by building an ashram
 rajkumaron kaa kutta bhatak kar eklavya ke ashram main ja pahunchaa
 He started screaming on seeing Eklavya
 kute ke bhunkane se eklavya kii sadhana main baadha pad rahi thi atah usne apane baanon se kute kaa munh band kar diya
 Ekalavya shot arrows with the skill that the dog was not hurt
 kute ke lautne par kaurav, pandav tathaa swayan dronacharya yah dhanurkaushal dekhakar dang rah gaye or baan chalaane vaale kii khoj karte hue eklavya ke paas pahunche
 He was even more surprised to know that Ekalavya, having considered Dronacharya as Manas Guru, has attained this learning by practice himself
 katha ke anusaar eklavya ne gurudakshina ke rup main apana angutha katkar dronacharya ko de diya tha
 a symbolic meaning of this could also be that Dronacharya, considering Eklavya to be super talented, donated the special method of bow to him without a thumb
 kehete hai ki angootha cat jane ke baad eklavya ne tarjani or madhyamaa anguli kaa prayog kar tir chalaane laga
 This is where the modern method of archery was born
 nihsandeh yah behatar tarika he or aajkal teerandaji isi tarah se hoti he
 In present times, no person does archery in the same way as Arjun used to do
