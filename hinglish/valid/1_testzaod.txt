 Once bhagwat-anuragi and saintly maharishis prayed to Sutaji, the supreme disciple of Sri Ved Vyas - o Gyanasagar! We were very happy to hear Vishnu Lord and Shankar's divine character and amazing pastimes from your Shrimukh
 ishwar main aasthaa badi or gyaan praapt kiya
 Now please, please recite by reciting the holiest Purana narratives that provide all the pleasures to mankind, who give spiritual power and provide enjoyment and salvation
 gyanechhu or vinamr mahatmaon kii nishkapat abhilaashaa jaanakar mahamuni sutaji ne anugrah sweekaar kiya
 He said - Out of a desire for public welfare, you expressed a great desire
 main aap logon ko use sunaata hoon
 It is true that Shri Mad Devi Bhagavat Purana is great in all the scriptures and religious texts
 iske saamne bade-bade tirth or vrath naganya hai
 On hearing this Purana, sins are destroyed by burning like a dry forest, due to which man does not have to suffer grief, grief, sorrow etc
 jis prakaar surya ke prakaash ke saamne andhkaar chant jaataa he, usee prakaar bhagwat puraana ke shravan se manushya ke sabhi ksht, vyaadhiyaan or sankoch samaapt ho jate hai
 The Mahatmas kept these curiosities with regard to Bhagavata Purana from Sutji: maharishi parashar or devi satyavati ke sanyog se shrinarayan ke anshavatar dev vyasaji kaa janm hua
 Vyasji, recognizing his time and the state of the society, divided the Vedas into four parts and made his four Patu disciples understand them
 iske pashchaat vedadhyayan ke adhikaar se vanchit nar-naariyon kaa mandabudhiyon ke kalyaan ke liye attharah puraanon kii rachana kii, taaki ve bhi dharm-paalan main samarth ho saken
 Sutji said - Mahatma! According to Guruji's responsibility, the responsibility of spreading and propagating seventeen Puranas came upon me, but the Bhog and Mokshadata Bhagavata Purana itself was narrated by Guruji to Janmejaya
 aap jaanate hai-janmejay ke pita raja parakshit ko takshak sarp ne das liya tha or raja ne apni hatya ke kalyaan ke liye shrimad bhagwat puraana kaa shravan kiya tha
 The king worshiped Lokmata Bhagwati Durga for nine days continuously and listened to the full Bhagavata Purana with the glory of Lokmata from the mouth of Muni Ved Vyasa
 sutaji ne kaha-mahatman! guruji ke aadeshaanusaar satraa puraanon ke prasar evam prachaar kaa daayitv mujh par aayaa, kintu bhoga or mokshadaata bhagwat puraana swayan guruji ne janmejay ko sunaaya
 You know - Janmejaya's father Raja Parikshit was bitten by the Takshak serpent and the king listened to Srimad Bhagavat Purana for the welfare of his murder
 raja ne nau din nirantar lokmata bhagwati durga kii puja-aradhana kii tathaa muni vedavyas ke mukh se lokmata kii mahima se purna bhagwat puraana kaa shravan kiya
 Sri Krishna was lost in an attempt to find Prasenjit who returned safely with the blessings of Sri Devi Bhagwati
 yah vrittant maharishiyon kii ichha se vistaar se sunaate hue shri sutaji kehane lage-sajjanon ! bahut pehle dwarka puri main bhojavanshi raja satrajit rahata tha
 Due to the devotion and worship of the Sun, he received a very bright gem named Swamantak
 mani kii kranti se raja swayan surya jaisaa prabhaa-mandit ho jaataa tha
 In this confusion, when the Yadavas spoke to Shri Krishna about the arrival of Lord Surya, then Antaryami Krishna, while removing the doubts of the Yadavas, said that the upcoming nobleman Maniadhari king is Satrajit, not Surya
 swamantak mani kaa gun tha ki usko dhaaran karne vaala pratidin aath kilo swarna praapt karegaa
 There was no sign of any kind of human or divine calamity in that region
 swamantak mani praapt karne kii ichha swayan krishna ne bhi kii lekin satrajit ne asweekaar kar diya
 Once Satrajit's brother Prasenjit, wearing the gem, went on a horse and went hunting, then a lion killed him
 sanyog se jamavant naamak rich ne singh ko hi maar daalaa or vah mani ko lekar apni gupha main aa gaya
 Jamwant's daughter started playing with the jewel, thinking it was a toy
 prasenjit ke na lautne par dwarka main yah afvaah fail gai ki krishna ko satrajit dwaara mani dene se inkaar karne par durbhaavnavash krishna ne prasenjit kii hatya kara di or mani par apana adhikaar kar liya
 Unhappy with this rumor, Krishna set out to find Prasenjit
 van main krishna or unke saathiyon ne prasenjit ke saath ek singh ko bhi mara paaya
 They also found signs of bear footprints there, which indicated the entrance into the cave
 isse krishna ne singh ko maarane tathaa mani ke rich ke paas hone kaa anumaan lagaaya
 Krishna himself entered the cave by telling his companions to stay outside and wait
 kaaphi samay baad bhi krishna ke waapas na aane par niraash hokar laute saathi ne krishna ke bhi maare jane kaa mithyaa prachaar kar diya
 On Krishna's return, his father Vasudeva was distressed in his son-mourning
 usee samay maharishi naarad aa gaye
 Knowing the news, Naradji preached to Vasudeva to listen to Shrimad Devi Bhagavata Purana
 vasudev maa bhagwati kii krupa se purv parichit the
 He told Naradji - Devarshi, while imprisoned with Devaki, when the six sons were killed at the hands of Kansa, both of our husbands and wives became very upset and upset
 tab apane kul purohit maharishi garg se paraamarsh kiya or ksht se chhutkaaraa paane kaa upaay poocha
 Gurudev asked to parade the saga of Jagadamba Maa
 karagaar main hone ke kaaran mere liye yah sambhav nahin tha
 Therefore, prayed to Gurudev to get this work done
 vasudev ne kaha-meri prarthana sweekaar karke gurudev ne vindhyachal parvat par jaakar brahmanon ke saath devi kii aradhana-archana kii
 Performed a Navagna sacrifice of Goddess Bhagwat by law
 anushthan purna hone par gurudev ne mujhe isaki soochna dete hue kaha-devi ne prasann hokar yah akashwani kii he-meri prerana se swayan vishnu prithvi ke ksht nivaaran hetu vasudev devaki ke ghar avatar lenge
 Vasudev should bring that child to the house of nand-yashoda of Gokul village and bring the girl of Yashoda born at the same time and hand it to Kamsa as the eighth child
 kansa yathavat balika ko dharti par patake degaa
 That girl will immediately leave Kansa's hand and wear a celestial body, part of me will dwell on the Vidhyanchal mountain for public welfare
 garg muni ke dwaara is anushthan fal ko sun kar maine prasannataa vyakt karte hue aage ghati ghatnaayen muni ke kathananusaar puri kin or krishna kii raksha kii
 After narrating this description, Vasudev said to Naradji - Muniver! Fortunately, your arrival has proved beneficial for me
 at: aap hi mujhe devi bhagwat puraana kii katha sunaakar upakrit karen
 At the behest of Vasudeva, Narada graciously performed Navahra Parine
 vasudev ne nawein din katha samaapti par naradji kii puja-archana kii bhagwati maa kii maaya se shrikrishna jab gupha main pravisht hue to unhone ek balika ko mani se khelte dekha
 As soon as Krishna took the gem from the girl, the girl wept
 balika ke rone kii aawaaj ko sunakar jamavant vahaan aa pahunchaa tathaa krishna se yuddh karne laga
 The war lasted for twenty-seven days in both
 devi kii krupa se jamavant lagaataar camoger padataa gaya tathaa shrikrishna shakti-sampann hote gaye
 In the end he defeated Jamwant
 bhagwati kii krupa se jamavant ko purv smriti ho ai
 Rama, who killed Ravana in Treta, worshiped him considering that he incarnated as Krishna in the copper age
 agyaan main kiye aparaadh ke liye kshamaa maangi
 Along with Mani, his daughter Jambavati was also happily dedicated to Krishna
 mathura main katha ke samaapt hone ke baad vasudev brahman bhoj ke baad aashirwad le rahe the, usee samay krishna mani or jambavati ke saath vahaan pahuch gaye
 There was no limit to the happiness of everyone seeing Krishna there
 bhagwati kaa aabhaar prakat karte hue vasudev-devaki ne shrikrishna kaa ashrupurit netron se swaagat kiya

 The set theory is a branch of mathematics that studies sets
 vastuon ke sangrah ko samucchy kehete hai
 Although a collection of any kind of objects is possible under a set, the set theory mainly studies only those related to mathematics
 sthool rup se angreji samucchy ke paryaay 'set', agrigate, class, domen tathaa totality hai
 The components in the set must be different
 pratham shrenee ke tark se suvyavasthit kiya hua samucchy siddhanth aaj ganit kaa sarvaadhik prayukt aadharbhoot tantra he
 The language of set theory is used to define almost everything in mathematics
 samucchy siddhanth ke aarmabhik concept itane saral hai ki inhen praathmik vidyalayon ke paathyakram main bhi padhaaya ja saktaa he
 The modern set theory was started by George Canter and Dedkind in 1870
 kisi samucchyon ke sadasyon ke bare main nimnlikhit chaar prakaar se bataate hai: sabhi sadasyon ko likhnaa ; Leaving some members dot-dot after writing; koi vivaran dena, jaise With the help of algebra; parimit samucchy : jiske sadasyon kii sankhya simit ho, jaise {3,7,9}
 Infinite set: whose number of members is unlimited, eg a = {2,4,6,8, xxrep 13 
 } rikt samucchy yaa shunya samucchy : jisamen sadasyon kii sankhya shunya ho yaa jiskaa koi sadsy hi na ho
 Let it be denoted by ∅ { \ displaystyle \ emptyset} or {}
 ∈ { \ displaystyle \ in } yah chihn dekar bataate hai ki koun samucchy kaa sadsy he
 For example, a member of s = {2,5,6,7,9} is 7
 ise ham likh sakate hai ki 7 ∈ s { \ displaystyle 7 \ in S} iske vipareet ∉ { \ displaystyle otin } chihn yah bataata he ki amuk cheez samucchy kaa sadsy nahin he
 For example, 3 numbers are not members of the aforesaid set S; We write that 3 ∉ s { \ displaystyle 3 \ notin S}
 " ∈ { \ displaystyle \ in } " is chihn ko 'sadsy he' kehete hai
 If all members of a set a are also members of any other set B, then it is said that a is a subset of B
 jaise, A={p,q,r}evam B={p,q,r,s} ho to ham likhte hai ki a ⊂ b { \ displaystyle a \ subset B} prayek samucchy ke do upasamucchy avashya hote hai; ek to swayan vahi samucchy apane aap kaa upasamucchy hota he, doosraa shunya samucchy sabhi samucchyon kaa upasamucchy he
 Write all the subsets of the set {a, b, c} then ∅ { \ displaystyle \ emptyset}, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c } And {a, b, c} and zero set
 yadi kisi samucchy main n sadsy hon to uske sabhi upasamucchyon kii sankhya 2 n { \ displaystyle 2^{n}} hogi
 a subset in which the number of members is less than the number of members of the original set is called a 'proper subset'
 kisi samasya main vidyaman sabhi upaadaanon ko lene par jo samucchy banataa he use us samasya ke saapeksh sarvasamaveshi samucchy kehete hai
 For example, an all-inclusive set of all odd numbers up to number 11 would be - ξ { \ displaystyle \ xi \ } = {1,3,5,7,9,11} wain aarekh kaa upyog karke samucchy siddhanth ke bahut si samasyaon kaa aasaani se samaadhaan kiya jaataa he
 The all-inclusive set is represented by a rectangle and all its subsets are represented by a circle
 is chitra main a ke poorak samucchy ko chhaayankit karke dikhaaya jaataa he, arthath a c { \ displaystyle A^{c}} 
 Also, draw circles within the circle to represent the subsets
 jaise b ⊆ a { \ displaystyle b \ subseteq A} If two sets are a and B, their common set will be the set of members in which both a and b are members
 jaise yadi A={2,4,7} evam B={2,3,7,8} ho to a or b kaa sarvanishtha samucchy {2,7} hoga jisko ham is tarah likhte hai: a ∩ b { \ displaystyle a \ cap B} ={2,7}chitra main wain aarekh main chaaya dwaara jo dikhaaya gaya he vah a ∩ b { \ displaystyle a \ cap B} he
 a set of two sets a and b is a set of members whose members are those who are in A, or in B, or both
 udaahranarth yadi A={3,4,6} evam B={2,3,4,5,6,7,8} ho to in donon samucchyon kaa sangh samucchy ko ham yon likhenge: a ∪ b { \ displaystyle a \ cup B} ={2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
 If no member is common in two sets a and B, then these two sets are called as disjoint sets
 ise ham aise likhte hai: a ∩ b { \ displaystyle a \ cap B} = ∅ { \ displaystyle \ emptyset } The components in the set must be different
 yadi x samucchy a kaa koi avyav he, to ham likhte he : x ∈ A
 By not giving details of all the elements, they can also be explained by a rule, such as a set of odd numbers
 b ko a kaa upasamucchy tab kehete hai, jab b kaa prayek avyav a kaa sadsy ho or ise is prakaar likhte hai : b ⊂ a 
 ise yon bhi padhate hai : B, a main samavisht he
 If a has at least one element that is not a member of b and b is a subset of A, then b is called the actual subset of A
 aise samucchy ko, jiskaa ek bhi avyav na ho, shunya samucchy kehete hai or ise φ se prakat karte hai
 Zero sets are useful in theoretical interpretation
 samucchyon par mul kriyaayein ye hai : taarkik yoga, taarkik gunan, taarkik vyakalan

 kaant kaa naitik mat "naitik shuddhta" kaa siddhant, "kartavya ke liye kartavya" kaa siddhant athwa "kathoratavaad" kaha jaataa he
 His philosophical view is known as "critical philosophy"
 emanuele kaant apane is prachaar se prasiddh huye ki manushya ko aise karm or kathan karne chahiyein jo agar sabhi karen to ve manushyata ke liye achche hon
 Emanuel Kant was born on April 22, 1724 AD, in the city of Königüzburg, under the East Provinces of Germany
 koniguzaberg shahar aaj rus main he or ab iskaa naam kalininograd Kaliningrad he
 His early education was under the supervision of his mother, who was greatly influenced by the religious movement called the "holy Way" of his time
 atev, alpaayu main hi vah dharmanumodith aacharan, saral, suvyavasthit evam adhyavsypurna jivan main ruchi rakhane laga tha
 At the age of 16, after completing his education at the "collegium Pheidrichianum", he entered the University of Königsberg, where for six years he studied physics, mathematics, philosophy and theology
 vishvavidhyalay chhodane ke baad kaant nau varshon ke liye, konigsburg se 60 mile dur, judsken naamak gaanv main chalaa gaya
 There he taught his livelihood in two families and continued his self-study in physics and philosophy
 is bich uske bahut se lekh tathaa laghugranth prakashit hue, jinamein se do–"jivit shaktiyon ke uchit anumaan par vichaar" tathaa "saamaanya prakritik itihaas evam akashasambandhi siddhant" vishesh ullekh hai
 In the first of these publications, he attempted to coordinate the ideas of power of Rene Dacart and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz, and in the second the mechanical and objectivist ideas of Newton and Leibnitz, and in the second, the mechanical and purposive ideas of Newton and Leibnitz
 usne "doctor legence" kii oopaadhi ke nimitt aavashyak prabandh bhi 1755 i
 main prastut kar diya tha or konigsburg vishvavidhyalay ne use ukt oopaadhi pradaan kar uski yogyata pramanit kii thi
 But there was no change in his personal problems
 vishvavidhyalay ne uske nau varsh ke parishram se prasann hokar use vishisht vyaakhyaata niyukt kar liya tha, kintu is kaary ke liye use vetan kuch bhi nahin miltaa tha
 Kant, despite odd circumstances, served the university unpaid until 1766 AD
 1758 i
 main usne tark or darshan ke mukhya adhyaaapak pad ke liye prarthana kii thi, kintu vah asafal rahaa
 In 1766 AD, he was appointed Assistant Library Manager along with teaching and now he got ten pounds annual salary
 chaar varshon tak kaant ne is rup main bhi kaary kiya, kintu usne adhyayan chintan or lekhan kaary jari rakhaa
 After being appointed "private Dozant", by 1770 AD, five of his epics were published - uparyukt granthon ke sheershakon se pataa chalata he ki 1755 or 1770 i
 ke bich kaa samay kaant ke vichaaron ke nirmaan kaa tha
 His thinking appears to have developed in a systematic way with the Latin installation paper published in 1770 AD - "the Shapes and Principles of World's Understanding and Wisdom"
 isi varsh, vah konigsburg vishvavidhyalay main tark or darshan ke usee adhyaaapak pad par niyukt hua, jiske liai use 12 varsh purv niraash hona padaa tha
 He had already become worry-free as he was getting 60 pounds annual salary
 un dinon itnaa vetan sammanit adhyapakon ko hi diya jaataa tha
 The publication of texts also did not yield any large amount of money
 apane "critic ov pyor rizan" se kaant ko keval 30 pound aay hui thi
 But, not aspiring for material comforts, till 1796 AD, he was actively striving for the growth of knowledge of the world
 in 26 varshon main se aadi ke 12 varsh usne keval ek pustak ""shuddh buddhi kii samiksha" ke likhane main vyateet kiye
 The above book was published in 1781 AD
 kaant ke praudh granthon main yah sarvshereshth darshanik granth mana jaataa he
 Other texts of this period include "the Role of Every Future Philosophy", "the Background of Ethics", "the Philosophical Foundations of Natural Science", "review of Practical Wisdom", "review of Judgment", "religion Limited Only by Wisdom", and " On eternal peace "
 1796 i
 ke baad bhi vah adhyayan, chintan evam lekhan main vyast rahaa kintu uske jivan ke ye aath varsh badi dayaneey dasha main vyateet hue
 His memory had become so weak that he had to remember even by writing small things
 swayan apane ghar kii dekhbhaal karne kii shakti usamen nahin thi; vivaah usne kiya nahin tha, kintu 42 varsh ke adhyaapan kaal main usne apane sahyogiyon evam vidhyaarthiyon par acha prabhaav daalaa tha
 Therefore, he received a lot of support and sympathy from friends and disciples in the last part of his life
 san 1801 i
 ke baad to vah bahut hi ashakt ho gaya tha, kintu antim teen varshon main vesiyaanski naamak uske shishy ne saath rahakar ahernish uski dekhbhaal kii
 Surprisingly, there are seven texts of Kant written in this period - "nitidarshan", "philosophical Foundations of the Theory of Moral Merit", "maanas shaktiyon kaa antvirodh,, "anthropology in practical terms", "tarkshastra, "bhautik bhugol" tathaa "shikshashastra" 
 After doing so much work, he died on 12 February 1804 in Königsberg
 kaant kaa vyaktigat jivan atal niyamon se jakadaaa hua tha
 From dawn to dusk, all his works were done at certain times
 bhojan ke samay ke sanlap ke bhi niyam the
 Most of the Western philosophers have been wandering, but Kant went more than sixty miles from his city in his lifetime
 phir bhi uskaa drushtikon sankuchit na tha
 He was not merely an intellectual thinker, he gave his philosophical ideas a place in life like Socrates and Pythagoras
 hine naamak german kavi ne kaant ke darshanik jivan kii prashansa main aisi baaten kahi hai jo use sanakee siddh karti hai, kintu, uske vichaaron ne uttarvarti darshan ko itnaa prabhavit kiya ki kaant ke adhyeta use darshan main ek naveen yug kaa pravartak maanate hai

64 Orchha near Jhansi has its own significance in the history of India
 isse judi tamaam kahaniyaan or kisse pichhali kai dashakon se logon kii jubaan par hai
 Some people say that the first people started living in Bundelkhand
 yahi vajah he ki is ilaake ke har gaanv or shahar ke paas sunaane ko kai kahaniyaan hai
 Two beautiful and interesting places of Bundelkhand are Orchha and Kundar
 bhale hi donon jagahon main kuch kilometre kaa faasla ho, lekin itihaas ke dhaagon se ye donon jagahen behad majbootee se judi hui hai
 Orchha is located about half an hour from Jhansi
 iskaa itihaas 8veen shatabdi se shuru hota he, jab gurjar pratihaar samraat mihir bhoj ne isaki sthapana kii thi
 The first and most interesting story of this place is that of a temple
 darasal, yah mandir bhagwaan ram kii murti ke liye banwaaya gaya tha, lekin murti sthapana ke vakt yah apane sthaan se hili nahin
 This idol was brought from Ayodhya by his queen Ganesh Kuwar during the reign of Madhukar Shah
 chaturbhuj mandir banane se pehle ise kuch samay ke liye mahal main sthapit kiya gaya
 But after the temple was built, no one could move the idol from its place
 ise ishwar kaa chamatkaar maanate hue mahal ko hi mandir kaa rup de diya gaya or iskaa naam rakhaa gaya ram raja mandir
 Today the city is situated around this palace and thousands of devotees gather here on Ram Navami
 vaise, bhagwaan ram ko yahaan bhagwaan maanane ke saath yahaan kaa raja bhi mana jaataa he, kyonki us murti kaa cheharaa mandir kii ore na hokar mahal kii ore he
 There is a garden near the temple in which two very high towers are the center of attraction of the people
 jinhen sawan bhadon kaha jaataa he ki inke neeche bani surangon ko shahi parivaar apane aane-jane ke raste ke taur par istemaal karata tha
 There is a legend about these pillars that according to Hindu calendar in the rainy season, these two pillars were joined at the end of the month of Sawan and the beginning of the month of Bhadon
 haalanki iske bare main pukhta saboot nahin hai

 It is said that Emperor Akbar sent Abul Fazl to control Shahzade Salim, but Salim killed him with the help of Bir Singh
 isse khush hokar saleem ne orchha kii kaman bir singh ko saunp di thi
 By the way, these palaces are evidences of the architecture of Bundelas
 khule galiyare, pattharon vaali jaali kaa kaam, jaanwaron kii murtiyon, belboote jaisi tamaam bundela vaastushilp kii visheshtaayen yahaan saaf dekhi ja sakati hai
 Now these very peaceful looking palaces were not like this in their era
 yahaan rojaanaa hone vaali nai halchal se upji kahaniyaan aaj bhi logon kii jubaan par hai
 One of these is the story of Hardaul, which dates back to the reign of Jujhar Singh
 darasal, mughal jasuson kii sajeeshabhari kathaon ke karan is raja kaa shaq ho gaya tha ki uski rani se uske bhai hardaul ke saath sambandh hai
 So he asked the queen to poison Hardaul
 rani ke aisa na kar paane par khud ko nirdosh sabit karne ke liye hardaul ne khud hi jehar pi liya or tyaag kii nai misaal kaayam kii
 With the end of the Bundelaas reign in 1783, Orchha too got lost in the thick forests of oblivion and then it came into the limelight during the freedom struggle
 darasal, swatantraaa senaanee chandrashekhar aaazaad yahaan ke ek gaanv main aakar chhipe the
 Today a memento is also made at his place of stay

 rani ne unhen apana mantavya bataaya
 Ramraja agreed to walk to Orchha but he kept three conditions - first, this journey will be on foot, second - the journey will be only in the flower constellation, third - the statue of Ramaraja will not rise again from the place where it will be kept
 rani ne raja ko sandesh bheja ki wo ramraaja ko lekar orchha aa raheen hai
 King Madhukarshah built the Chaturbhuj Temple at a cost of crores to establish the Deity of Ramaraja
 jab rani orchha pahunchi to unhone yah murti apane mahal main rakh di
 It was decided that the statue would be consecrated by placing the idol in the auspicious idol in the Chaturbhuj temple
 lekin ram ke is vigrah ne chaturbhuj jane se manaa kar diya
 It is said that Ram came here as a child and leaving his mother's palace, how could he go to the temple
 ram aaj bhi isi mahal main virajman hai or unke liye bana karodon kaa chaturbhuj mandir aaj bhi viraan pada he
 This temple is still idolless
 yah bhi ek sanyog he ki jis samvath 1631 ko ramraaja kaa orchha main aagaman hua, usee din ramcharita maanas kaa lekhan bhi purna hua
 The idol present in Orchha is told that when Ram was going to exile, he gave one of his child idols to mother Kaushalya
 maa kaushalya usee ko bal bhoga lagaaya karti thim
 When Ram returned to Ayodhya, Kaushalya immersed this idol in the Saryu River
 yahi murti ganeshkunwari ko sarayu kii majdhaar main mili thi
 It is the only temple in the world where Rama is worshiped as a king and he is given a salute before sunrise and after sunset

" "bimbwad ko kabhi-kabhi vikaas kii nirantar yaa satat avadhi ke bajaay rachanaatmak kshanon ke ek silsle ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 René Topin has commented that it is more accurate to understand Bimbism as an association of some poets who were unanimous on the important principles of a small number for a certain time, rather than understanding it as a doctrine and a poetic sect

S
 per tonne of heavy distillate
 Gallons, 272 gallons of crude oil per ton and 333 gallons of gasoline per ton
 19veen sadi ke uttarardh kaa woodan oil bairal aadhunik samay ke 55-galen steel drum se alag he
 The 42-us-gallon oil barrel is a unit of measurement and is no longer used to transport crude oil - most petroleum is carried in pipelines or oil tankers
 maapan kii ek ikai ke rup main bairal ke 42-yues galen kaa aakaar zyaadaatar america tel udyog tak hi simit he kyonki bairal ke anya aakaaron ko sanyukt rajya america main anya udyogon dwaara istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 Almost all other countries use the metric system
 kai tel utpaadak desh america oil bairal kaa upyog karte hai
 This measurement originated in the early Pennsylvania oil fields
 1860 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main jab tel kaa utpaadan shuru hua tha, us samay tel ke liye koi maanak container nahin tha, isiliye tel or petroleum utpaadon ko bear, machhlee, gud, tarpin aadi ke liye vibhinn aakaaron or swaroopon ke baralon main rakhaa or sthanantarit kiya jaataa tha
 Both 42-US gallon barrels, tiers and 40-us-gallon whiskey barrels were used
 45-galen bairal bhi aam upyog main the
 The 40-gallon whiskey barrel was the most common size used by early oil producers because they were readily available at the time
 42-galen oil bairal kii utpatti kii jaankaree aspasht he lekin kuch aitihaasik dastavejon se sanket miltaa he ki 1866 kii shuruyaat ke aasapaas pennsilvania ke tel utpaadak nishkarsh par pahunche the ki alag-alag kismon ke contenron main tel kii shipping tel ke kharidaaron main avishvaas paidaa kar rahaa tha
 They decided that they needed a standard unit of measurement to convince their buyers that they were getting a fair amount in exchange for their money
 ve is maapan kaa aadhaar kamobesh maanak 40-galen whisky bairal rakhane par sahamat ho gaye lekin do galenon kii ek atirikt maatra unhone yah sunishchit karne ke liye jod di ki maapan kii koi bhi truti hameshaa kharidaar ke paksh main hogi jo kharidaar kaa vishwaas jeetne kaa ek atirikt tarika tha, jaahir taur par yah usee siddhant par aadhaarit tha jo bekars dajan or maapan ke kuch anya lambii ikaayiyon ke peeche tha
 By 1872 the standard oil barrel was firmly established as 42-US gallons
 sankshepan 1 embairal or 1 membairal kaa aitihaasik rup se matlab kramshah ek hazaar or ek million bairal tha
 These are derived from the Latin language "mille" rather than "mega" which means "thousand"
 haalanki isse mega ke esai sankshepan ke saath bhram kii sthiti paidaa ho sakati he - bairal hota he
 Barrel per day, BD or b / D) is a measurement used to indicate the rate of crude oil production or consumption by a unit
 udhaaharan ke liye ek tel kshetra 100,000 bipidi kaa utpaadan kar saktaa he or ek desh 1 million bipidi kii khapat kar saktaa he
 Note: There should not be confusion of BLPD with BPD which is related not only to crude oil but to total liquid including water
 ye vibhinn maatra ke wolum hai
 BPD is related to BOE, which is a common way of describing the amount of energy in hydrocarbon gases in order to compare in the case of crude oil
 beepi statistical rivyuu 2006 ke anusaar: The barrel is a standard petroleum downstream industry measurement of actual refinery throughput as opposed to designed capacity per calendar day

 It is important that they are not confused with SI prefixes, where KBD and MBD would mean one thousand and one million barrels per day respectively
 ek bairal kaa upyog takneekee rup se kisi bhi maatra ko nirdeshit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 As the true nature of the liquids being measured varies with the current, qualifiers are sometimes used to explain what is being directed
 tel kshetra main taral padaarthon ke utpaadan kii daron ke bich antar rakhana aksar mahatvapurn hota he, jo kachche tel or pani ke ek mishran or swayan tel ke utpaadan kii daren ho sakati hai
 If a well produces 10 mbd of liquids with a water reduction of 20%, the well will also be said to produce 8,000 barrels of raw per day
 anya paristhitiyon main utpaadan or khapat ke aankadon main gas ko shaamil karnaa mahatvapurn ho saktaa he
 The gas is usually measured in standard cubic feet, but when needed, this volume is converted to an amount of oil equal to the enthalpy of combustion
 iske sadrush utpaadan or khapat ko prati din samatuly tel ke baralon ke rup main kaha jaataa he
 It is common for water wells to refer to the injectivity rate of water barrels per day

 Philosophy is an approach to test reality
 darshanik chintan multah jivan kii arthvatta kii khoj kaa paryaay he
 In fact, philosophy is the science of self, that is, nature and society, and the general rules of the process of human thought and cognition
 darshanashastra saamaajik chetana ke roopon main se ek he
 Philosophy is the name of the discipline that seeks truth and knowledge
 vyapak arth main darshan, tarkpurna, vidhipurvak evam krambaddh vichaar kii kala he
 It is born according to experience and situation
 yahi kaaran he ki sansar ke bhinn-bhinn vyaktiyon ne samay-samay par apane-apane anubhavon evam paristhitiyon ke anusaar bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke jivan-darshan ko apanaaya
 The history of Indian philosophy is very old, but in the sense of philosophy, the term philosophy was first used by Pythagoras
 vishisht anushaasan or vigyaan ke rup main darshan ko plato ne viksit kiya tha
 It originated as a science in the slave-master society, which had united the gross sum of human knowledge about the objective world and itself
 yah maanav itihaas ke aarambhik sopanon main gyaan ke vikaas ke nimna str ke kaaran sarvatha swaabhaavik tha
 In the process of development of social production and accumulation of scientific knowledge, different sciences got separated from philosophy and philosophy started developing as an independent science
 jagat ke vishay main saamaanya drushtikon kaa vistaar karne tathaa saamaanya aadhaaron va niyamon kaa karne, yatharth ke vishay main chintan kii tarkbuddhiparak, tark tathaa sangyaan ke siddhant viksit karne kii aavashyaktaa se darshanashastra kaa ek vishisht anushaasan ke rup main janm hua
 The fundamental question of philosophy as a separate science is the problem of contemplation with self, the relation of consciousness with ghosts
 darshan vibhinn vishyon kaa vishleshan he 
 Therefore, the philosophy of consciousness is indispensable in Indian philosophy, which is not in modern philosophy
 maanav jivan kaa charam lakshya dukhon se chhutkaaraa praapt karke chir anand kii prapti he
 The same goal of Indian philosophies is to liberate the human from ignorance from the root cause of suffering and attain salvation
 yani agyaan va paramparawaadi or roodhiwaadee vichaaron ko nasht karke satya gyaan ko praapt karnaa hi jivan kaa mukhya uddeshy he
 There has been a tendency for curiosity and exploration in humans since time immemorial
 prakruti ke udbhav tathaa surya, chandra or grahon kii sthiti ke alaava paramatma ke bare main bhi jaanane kii jigyaasa maanav main rahi he
 It is the result of his relentless efforts to eradicate these curiosities that we are living in such a developed society
 parantu pracheen rishi-muniyon ko is bhautik samruddhi se na to santosh hua or na chir anand kii prapti hi hui
 Therefore, in order to attain this truth and knowledge, he started searching for knowledge through subtle and subtle means and he also got success in it
 usee satya gyaan kaa naam darshan he
 Dishtehyeneti darshanam arthath asat evam sat padaarthon kaa gyaan hi darshan he
 The term Western Philosophy is derived from Philos + Sophia
 isliye philosphy kaa shabdic arth he buddhi prem
 The Western philosopher wants to become a wise or intelligent person
 paashchaatya darshan ke itihaas se yah baat jhalak jaati he ki paashchaatya darshanik ne vishay gyaan ke aadhaar par hi budhimaan hona chaha he
 Some examples will be found to the contrary in which it is also found ideal to conduct interviews with Paramasta on the basis of conduct purification and precision of mind
 parantu yah adarsh praachya he na ki paashchaatya
 The Western philosopher insists on his knowledge and does not consider it mandatory to conduct his character according to his knowledge
 keval paashchaatya rahasywaadee or samadhivaadi vichaarak hi iske apwaad hai
 Darshan is another name to be interviewed with supreme authority in Indian philosophy
 bhartiya parampara ke anusaar manushya ko param satta kaa saakshaat gyaan ho saktaa he
 In this way, the path of devotional knowledge and yoga are explained for the interview
 parantu darshanik gyaan ko vaigyanik gyaan se bhinn kaha gaya he
 In acquiring scientific knowledge, the subject of change has to be changed so that it can be subdued according to its will and then its intended use can be done
 parantu praachya darshan ke anusaar darshanik gyaan jivan sadhana he
 Such a philosophy changes the philosopher himself
 use divya drushti praapt ho jaati he
 By which he sees all beings with his macro vision
 samasamyik vichaardhaara main praachya darshan ko dharm-darshan mana jaataa he or paashchaatya darshan ko bhashaa sudhaar tathaa pratyayon kaa spashtikaran kaha jaataa he Philosophy is the interpretation of experience
 is vyakhya main jo kuch aspasht hota he, use spasht karne kaa ytn kiya jaataa he
 Our knowledge centers open outwards, we often dissolve in the external world
 kabhi kabhi hamaara dhyaan antarmukh hota he or ham ek nae lok kaa darshan karte hai
 As soon as the facts are visible, moral sense also commands
 vaastaviktaa or sambhaavna kaa bhed adarsh ke pratyay ko vyakt karata he
 Under the influence of this suffix we look upwards
 is tarah darshan ke pramukh vishay bahya jagat, chetan aatma or paramatma ban jate hai
 While considering them, we naturally consider their relationship
 pracheen kaal main rachana or rachayita kaa sambandh pramukh vishay tha, madhyakaal main aatma or paramatma kaa sambandh pramukh vishay bana or aadhunik kaal main purush or prakruti, vishayi or vishay, kaa sambandh viven kaa centre bana
 Physics, logic and policy in ancient Greece, these three were considered three parts of philosophy
 bhautikee baahar kii ore dekhati he, tark swayan chintan ko chintan kaa vishay banaata he, niti jaananaa chaahati he ki jivan ko vyavasthit karne ke liye koi nirpeksh aadesh gyaat ho saktaa he yaa nahin
 The main questions in philosophy are- 1
 gyaan ke atirikt gyaata or gyey kaa bhi astitv he yaa nahin? 2
 What is the nature of final power? Is it one type, or more than one type? pracheen kaal main niti kaa pramukh lakshya ni:shreyas ke swaroop ko samajhnaa tha
 In modern times, Kant replaced the suffix of duty as the fundamental suffix
 tripti yaa prasannataa kaa moolyankan vivaad kaa vishay bana rahaa he
 The main questions in Jnanamimamsa are- 1
