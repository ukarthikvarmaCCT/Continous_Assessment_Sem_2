 The new poetry movement is believed to have originated from the magazine "new Poetry" published in 1954 under the editors of the poet writers of Jagadish Gupta, Ramswaroop Chaturvedi and Vijayadevanarayan Sahi of the literary institution of Allahabad, Parimal
 isse pehle agyeya ke sampadan main prakashit kavy-sangrah 'doosraa saptak' kii bhoomika tathaa usamen shaamil kuch kaviyon ke vaktavyon main apni kaviton ke liye 'nayi kavita' shabd ko sweekaar kiya gaya tha
 For the new poem, no situation, relation, sentiment or thought related to world life is relevant as a story
 janm se lekar maran tak aaj ke maanav-jivan kaa jin sthitiyon, paristhitiyon, sambandhon, bhaavon, vichaaron or kaaryon se saahchary hota he, unhen nayi kavita ne abhivyakt kiya he
 The new poet has not considered any of the stories to be sacrilegious
 kathy ke prati nayi kavita main swanubhuti kaa aagrah he
 The new poet wants to present his story in the form in which he feels it
 nayi kavita vaad-mukti kii kavita he
 Earlier poets too often resorted to some debate
 or yadi kavi vaad kii parvaah na karen, kintu aalochak to uski rachana main kavy se pehle vaad khojataa tha-vaad se kavy kii parakh hoti thi
 But the situation of the new poem is different
 nayaa kavi kisi bhi siddhant, matvaad, sampradaay yaa drushti ke aagrah kii kattarta main fasane ko taiyaar nahin
 In short, the new poem is not an argument, limited in its narrative and vision
 kathy kii vyapaktaa or sristi kii unmuktata nai kavita kii sabase badi visheshta he
 The new poem does not follow the tradition
 manushyon main vaiyaktik bhinnata hoti he, usamen achchhiyaan bhi hai or buraayeeyaan bhi
 Man is beloved in all these forms to the poet of the new poem
 uskaa uddeshy manushya kii samagrata kaa chithran he
 The new poem maintains faith in life
 aaj kii kshanavaadi or laghumanavvaadi drushti jivan-mulyon ke prati sweekaaratmak drushti he
 In the new poem, there is a desire to enjoy life by accepting it fully
 jivan kii ek-ek anubhutiyon ko, vyathaa ko, sukh ko, satya maanakar jivan ko saghan rup se sweekaar karnaa kshamon ko satya maananaa he
 The new poem neither saw life as one-sided or not only in critical form, he saw life as life
 isamen koi seemaa nirdhaarit nahin kii
 Like- grief begs everyone and, even if we do not know how to liberate ourselves, but - whoever asks for it, teaches them to keep everyone free
 nai kavita main do tatv pramukh hai- anubhuti kii sachai or buddhimulak yathartwaadee drushti
 That feeling of the moment or of an entire period, of a common man or of a specific man, of hope or of despair, is invaluable for poetry in its truth and also for life
 nai kavita main buddhivaad naveen yathartwaadee drushti ke rup main bhi he or naveen jivan-chetana kii pahchaan ke rup main bhi
 This is why neutral experimentation is the hallmark of both poetry and genre
 nayaa kavi apane kathy ke prati tatasth vritti rakhata he, kyonki uskaa praytn vaadon se mukt rahane kaa rahata he
 Due to this feature, there is no single circumference of the statements in the new verse
 isamen to kathy se kathy kii nai paraten ughadati aati hai
 Sometimes he even refutes his own statements - because of honesty
 nayaa kavi duubakar bhogata he, kintu bhogate hue dub nahin jaataa
 The new poem considers each moment of life to be true and supports to enjoy that truth with full heart and full consciousness
 anubhuti kii sachai, jitna vah le paata he, utana hi uske kavy ke liye satya he
 The new poem seeks to capture sensual deep moments, passions, business or any truth with its inner poignancy
 is prakaar jivan ke saamaanya se saamaanya deekhanevaale vyapaar yaa prasang nai kavita main nayaa arth paa jate hai
 In the new poem, many poignant poems have been written about the sensations of moments
 jo aakaar main choti hoti hai kintu prabhaav main atyant teevr
 The new poem does not follow the tradition
 in kaviyon ne paramparawaadi jadta kaa virodh kiya he
 Progressive poets have opposed the inertia of tradition because it makes people a victim of exploitation and hinders the laborers and Dalits of the world from gathering under one flag
 nayaa kavi uskaa virodh isliye karata he ki uske kaaran maanav-vivek kunthit ho jaataa he
 The new poem attempts to examine social reality and the role of the person in it
 iske kaaran hi nai kavita kaa saamaajik yatharth se gaharaa sambandh he
 But the realist vision of the new poem, not saturated with imaginary or idealistic humanism, seeks the value of life, its beauty, its light in life itself
 nai kavita dvivedi kaaleen kavita, chhayavaad yaa pragativaad kii tarah apane bane-banaaye moolyalaadi nuskhe pesh nahin karti, balki vah to use jivan kii sachhee vyathaa ke bheetar paanaa chaahati he
 Therefore, in the new poem, there is a rejection of old values in the form of satire, and somewhere a belief in the possibility of new values rising from within the truth of pain
 nai kavita ne dharm, darshan, niti, aachaar sabhi prakaar ke mulyon ko chunauti di he
 The tone of the new poem is bursting with life experience of its surroundings
 nai kavita main shahari jivan or gramin-jivan-donon pariveshon ko lekar likhanewaale kavi hai
 Agnay has written on both
 jabaki baalkrishna raav, shamsher bahadur singh, girijakumar maathur, kunvaranarayan singh, dharmaveer bharti, prabhakar machave, vijayadevnarayan saahi, raghuveer sahay aadi kavi kii samvednaayen or anubhutiyaan shahari parivesh kii hai to duusari ore bhavaniprasad mishra, kedarnath singh, shambhunath singh, thakurprasad singh, nagarjun, kedarnath agarwal aadi aise kavi hai jo multah gaanv kii anubhutiyaan or samvednaa se jude hai
 Apart from this, where there is suffocation, futility, boredom, defeat, inferiority, resentment, there are also self-inflicted feelings
 nai kavita kaa parivesh apane yahan kaa jivan he
 But there is an attack on him that he has additional disgust, despair, individualistic frustration and morbidity which is born out of imitation of the West
 nai kavita main pidaa or niraashaa ko kahin-kahin jivan kaa ek paksh na maanakar samgr jivan-satya maan liya gaya he
 There, pain has become a hindrance to stagnate, not becoming a creative force of life
 lok-sampukti nai kavita kii ek khaas visheshta he
 She is trying to get closer to easy folk life
 bhavani prasad mishra kii kavitaaon kii samiksha karte hue professor mahavir saran jain kaa kathan he ki "hindi kii nai kavita par sabase bada akshep yah he ki usamen atirikt anasthaa, niraashaa, vishaad, hataasha, kuntha or marandharmita he
 After reading it, the urge to live ends, the person becomes discouraged, the mind becomes pessimistic and moribund
 yah ki nai kavita ne pidaa, vednaa, shok or niraashaa ko hi jivan kaa satya maan liya he
 The new poem does not draw inspiration from the land of India
 iske vipareet yah pashchim kii nakal se paidaa hui he
 The poems of Bhavani Prasad Mishra demolish all these allegations
 mishra ji gandhivaadi he
 Gandhi's patriotism does not have a destination
 gandhi ji kii desh-bhakthi vishwa ke jeev maatr ke prati prem or uski seva karne ke liye unki jivan yatra kaa ek padaav he
 There is no sense of despair anywhere in his view
 usamen aashaa, vishwaas or aasthaa kii jyoti aalokit he
 Due to this light, the mass movements that Gandhiji started in South Africa and India filled the whole society with new awakening, new consciousness and new resolve
 unke jivan darshan se vishaad, niraashaa or maran-dharmita nahin apitu iske sarvatha vipareet nai aashaa, nai aasthaa or nai umang paidaa hoti he
 From it flows the trinity of truth, non-violence and love
 
 The poems of Bhavani Prasad Mishra are the reason why the poor are helpless, weary, tired, dashed in the society and motivate them all to support them, encourage them to take up "
 nai kavita ne lok-jivan kii anubhuti, saundarya-bodh, prakrutti or uske prashnon ko ek sahaj or udaar maanviya bhoomi par grahan kiya
 At the same time, he made himself highly sensitive and alive by choosing from the images, symbols, words and epithets of folk life
 kavita ke upree aayojan nai kavita vahan nahin kar sakati
 It differs from the rest of the assumptions about the craft of poetry in its sphere, image, new symbol-scheme, use of new adjectives, new epithets
 nai kavita kii bhashaa kisi ek paddati main bandhakar nahin chalati
 The use of colloquial language for strong expression has been more in it
 nai kavita main keval sanskrit shabdon ko hi aadhaar nahin banaaya he, balki vibhinn bhashaaon ke prachlit shabdon ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 New words have also been created
 toye, bhabhake, khinchaa, siti, thithuran, thasakna, chidchidi, thunth, viras, siraaya, phunagiana – jaise anek shabd nai kavita main dhadlle se prayukt hue hai
 Which gives an openness and refreshment in its language
 isaki bhashaa main lok-bhashaa ke tatv bhi samahit hai
 The new poem has a plethora of symbols
 jaise- saanp tum sabhy to hue nahin, na honge, nagar main basna bhi tumhen nahin aayaa
 Ask one thing? Will answer Then learned how to laugh? Where did you get the poison? Bimb is also available in large quantities in the new poem
 nai kavita kii vividh rachanaaon main shabd, arth, takneekee, mukt aasang, divaswapn, saahchary, puranic, prakruti sambandhi kavy bimb nirmitt kiye gayi hai
 Just like - in front of me in winter, after covering the sack, one or her own hands and feet, shivering, shaking, - he will die
 nai kavita main chand ko keval ghor asweekruti hi mili ho- yah baat nahin, balki is kshetra main vividh prayog bhi kiye gayi hai
 The new poets have neither raga nor injustice towards any medium or craft
 gatishalata ke prabhaav ke liye sangeet kii lay ko tyagkar nai kavita dhwani-parivartan kii ore badhati gai he
 The old style of writing a long poem or an entire poem, presenting a sangopang description of it with the help of a veritable subject or sentiment, has been abandoned by the new poem
 nai kavita ke kaviyon ne lambii kavitaayen bhi likhi hai
 But they are not parallel to the old management poetry
 nai kavita kaa prayek kavi apni nijee vishistataa rakhata he
 For new poets, the key is communication, not the medium of communication
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki nai kavita kathy or shilp-donon hi drushtiyon se mahatvapurn uplabdhi he
 1761 is an ordinary year of Gregory calendar

 bharat main paae jane vaale muslim logon ke purvaj hindu hi the is bare main vibhinn stroto se jaankaree praapt hoti rahi he 
 In his book, François Gauerter admitted that more than 90% of Indian Muslim people were of Hindu origin who were converted
 | Similar details are also found from other sources that the original ancestors of the Muslim population of present day South East Asia were Hindus
 isi prakaar pustak "explaining communal violence" main yah bhi mana gaya he kii bharatiyon pustako main jahaan yah dikhaaya jaataa he kii muslim dharm bharat main hajaaron varshon se he kintu iske uparant bhi vartmaan bhartiya muslimon kii jansankhya ke 95% bhaag ke mul hindu purvaj hi the, jinhone dharm parivartan kar liya
 One of the major reasons for this was the fevered caste system of India
 sumati bhargav naamak brahman dwaara rishi bhrigu ke naam par likhi gayi manu smriti main varnit shudra logo ke prati kur adesho ke is varg par ghor atyachhaar kiye gaye
 He was ordered to be deprived of arms and education
 is pustak main shudra dwaara chote chote aparaadho par bhi bhayankar prakaar ke shaareerik dando kaa praavdhaan kiya
 They were forced into inferiority in social and religious life and forced to leave
 is prakaar unhen maansik gulaami ke liye vivash kar diya gaya
 Buddhism and Jainism can be considered the first religion in which they attacked the caste system based on birth

 kintu dhire dhire in logo ko samaj main aayaa or bharat main islam or isaai dharm ke aane par lakho kii sankhya main shudra log muslim or isaai ban gaye pej 329 | | Many Hindu ethnicities of India left Hinduism in medieval India and went to Muslim religion
 The following is a brief description of the various Muslim castes found in India, who believe in their original Hindu religion - * Patel - found in Gujarat Major Muslim race known In the 15th century, the people of this caste mainly accepted the Muslim religion
 ye apana mul hindu dharm ko maanate he | hinduon main bhi patel jati pai jaati he | aaj bhi ye log kai hindu parampara ko ye maanate he, inaki gotra gangaat, dalal, desi munshi aadi hindu samkaksh main bhi milte he | yah jati mukhyat: apane samaaj main hi shaadi karti| Pinjara or Pinara - is a Muslim caste that works as a cotton wool

 These people do not eat cow meat and marry only in their society | Their gotras like Sheth, Jadeja, Solanki which seemed like the main Rajput gotras
 *sindhi muslim - the apane aapako hinduon se parivartit maanate he or apana mul hindu rajput se maanate he | inke pramukh atak yaa gotra is prakaar raav, taak, devda, chohautar - maharashtra main pai jane vaali ek muslim jati he| ye log 1294 se 1674 isvi main dharm parivartit hue the | * Mang Garudi - Even in Muslim society, Mang Gardu caste is found

 Even today their main gotra - Rao, Deora, Tak Chohan Bhati which is also a Rajput tribe
 * Bohra - This is a Muslim caste found in Western India which considers Shia community
 It remains involved in a business etc
 According to Asghar Ali Engineer, the Bohra community is formed by the conversion of local Indian castes
 These people marry in their society itself
 Even today many Hindu practices can be seen in their lives
 Page 195 * Deshwali - These people used to be converted from Rajput castes, Deshwali means protector of the country
 These people are tempted to convert

 It is considered to be the second largest pilgrimage in the world after Mecca and Medina, where devotees number in crores every year
 shabarimala shaiva or vaishnavon ke bich kii adbhut kadi he
 In Malayalam, 'shabarimala' means mountain
 vastav main yah sthaan sahyadri parvatamala se ghire hue pathanathita jile main sthit he
 One has to travel on foot from Pampa to Sabarimala
 yah rasta paanch kilometre lanbaa he
 Ayyappan is considered to be an incarnation of the infant Shasta mentioned in the Kamb Ramayana, the Eighth Scandal of the Maha Bhagwat and the Asura Scandal of Skandpuran
 kehete hai, shasta kaa janm mohini veshadhari vishnu or shiv ke samagam se hua tha
 The famous temple of Ayyappan is located in this Dham, situated among 18 hills, known as Punakavan, which is called Sabarimala Sridharmashastha Temple
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki parashuram ne ayppan puja ke liye sabarimala main murti sthapit kii thi
 Some people also associate it with the name of Rambhakta Shabari
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki kareeb 700-800 saal pehle dakshin main shaiva or vaishnavon ke bich vaimnasy kaaphi bad gaya tha
 Mr
 Ayyappan was then envisaged to address those differences
 donon ke samanvay ke liye is dharmatirth ko viksit kiya gaya
 Even today, this temple is considered a symbol of harmony and harmony
 yahaan kisi bhi jati-birdari kaa or kisi bhi dharm kaa paalan karne vaala vyakti aa saktaa he
 On reaching Pampa, we decided to travel to Sabarimala on foot
 yah maarg durgam he, par prakruti ke bich hone kaa ahsaas aisa jokhim uthaane ke liye man ko taiyaar kar detaa he
 Sri Ayyappan's birth is considered to be on the day of coincidence of Makar Sankranti and Uttara Phalguni Nakshatra, coinciding with Panchami Tithi and Scorpio Lagna
 isiilie makar sankranti ke din bhi dharmashashtha mandir main utsav manaaya jaataa he
 We reached there on the day of Makar Sankranti
 yah mandir sthapaty ke lihaaj se to khubasurat he hi, yahaan ek ajeeb kism kii shanti kaa ahsaas bhi hota he
 Just as it is situated between 18 hills, similarly one has to cross 18 steps to reach the temple courtyard
 mandir main ayppan ke alaava malikapuratt ammaa, ganesh or nagaraja jaise up devataaon kii bhi murtiyon hai
 Ayyappan is anointed with ghee during the festival
 mantron kaa jor-jor se uccharan ho rahaa tha
 In one corner of the complex, there were standing elephants adorned

 Apart from these, the doors of the temple remain closed for common visitors throughout the year
 yahaan ek or baat par gaur kiya
 Most of the male devotees were present here

 Therefore, there can be small girls here, who are not menstruating or old women, who have become free from it
 jati-dharm kaa bandhan na maanane ke baavjood yah bandhan shraddhaluon ko maananaa hota he
 The rest, a wonderful example of secularism, is seen at a place called Erumeli, just a few miles from here, as the mausoleum of the Muslim Dharmanuayi Vavar, considered an ally of Mr
 Ayyappan, where the visit here would not have been complete without waiting for a visit
 do maton ke samanvay ke alaava dharmik sahishnutaa kaa ek niraala hi rup yahaan dekhne ko mila

258600 Antioxidants or antibodies are compounds that are mixed with small amounts of other substances to inhibit their reaction with the oxygen of the atmosphere
 in yogicon ko oxikaran nirodhak tathaa sthayeekari bhi kehete hai tathaa sthayeekari bhi kehete hai
 That is, anti-oxidants are molecules that protect other molecules from oxidation or slow down the oxidation process of other molecules
 oxikaran ek prakaar kii rasinic kriya he jiske dwaara kisi padaarth se electron yaa hydrogen oxikaarak agent ko sthanantarit ho jate hai
 Antioxidants are used in medical science and industry
every oxidizer is added to petrol main pratioxikaarak milaae jate hai
 These antioxidants do not allow the formation of viscosity-causing substances that are harmful to the internal combustion engine
 praayah pratisthapit phenol evam fenilanediamine ke vyutpann is kaam ke liye prayukt hote hai
 Many compounds are automatically oxidized by oxygen in the air when they are kept open
 is rasinic kriya ke falswaroop un padaartho main kuch avaanchhneeya gundharm aa jate hai, jo unako saadhaaran upyog ke liye anupyukt kar dete hai
 Many such changes are realized by ordinary senses
 at: swat: oxikaran dwaara padaartho ke bighad jane tathaa adhik dinon tak surakshit rakhane kaa gyaan manushya ko bahut dinon se tha yadhyapi 'swat: oxikaran' kii kriya kaa purna gyaan kaaphi baad main ho paaya
 The process of automatic oxidation takes place in four terms: praarambhik pad jo bahut hi mand gati se ghatit hota he, Accelerating speed respectively, lagbhag sthaayee gati tathaa Last loss-oriented motion
 pratham pad tathaa duusare pad kii mand gati tak kii jo avadhi hoti he use praren avadhi kehete hai or yah is baat ko pradarshit karata he
 This confirms the oxidation reaction process based on the chain reaction
 swat: oxikaran prakriya main shrunkhalaavahak kaa kaam muktamulak karte hai jo bahut hi sakriy hote hai
 They are formed by breakdown of the weakest carbon – hydrogen bond in the molecule that is self oxidized
 at: is prakaar ke padaarth main aasaani se nikal janevaale ek hydrogen parmaanu kii upasthiti aavashyak he
 In addition, it should also have a binary with which the free radical can be combined
 yadhyapi oxikaran abhikriyaayein jivan ke liye ati mahatvapoornan hai, ve hanikaarak bhi ho sakati hai
 Oxidation reactions can produce free radicals, which initiate chain reactions that damage cells
 pratioxikaarak padaarth swayan in mukt mulkon se oxikrut ho jate hai jisase shrunkhlaa abhikriya ko todane main madad milti he
 Taxes inhibit these chain reactions that occur on cells
 atev praayah antioxident ridusing agents hote hai, jaise thaol, escorbic amla yaa poliphinol aadi
 a complex system of manufacture and collection of various types of antioxidants is found in plants and animals
 inamen glutathion,, vitamin-si, vitamin-i, anzime aadi aate hai
 Inadequate amounts of antioxidants or the destruction of antioxidant enzymes cause oxidative stress that can cause damage or death of cells
 aisa samajha ja rahaa he ki oxikar tanaav hi anekon rogon kaa kaaran he
 Therefore, in pharmacology, antibiotics are intensively studied, especially for trauma and neurodegenerative diseases
 oxikar tanaav rogon kaa kaaran bhi he or parinaam bhi
 Antioxidants are used extensively as a complementary food
 pratioxikaarak adhikansh carbonic yogic, jaise aromatic amin, finol, emino finol aadi hote hai jo saralata se hydrogen parmaanu nikaalkar muktamulak main parinat ho saken or shrunkhalit kriya kaa prasaaran kar saken
 Antioxidants are automatically destroyed while doing their work, or substances which are automatically oxidized, respectively
 rabar, gasoline tathaa snehak tel aadi kuch padaartho main to pratioxikaarak swat: vidyaman rahete hai par unke shodhan ke samay ve nasht ho jate hai
 Therefore, care has to be taken that they are not destroyed or after refining they have to get more antioxidants
 anek aldihide, jese benzeldihide bahut hi teevr gati se swat: oxikrut ho jate hai at: use rokane ke liye hydroquinon, alphanafathal, katicol aadi pratioxikarakon kaa upyog karnaa padataa he
 Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in 1996 by singer Sharon den Edle and guitarist Robert Westerholt

 samaantar pratirup ek pramukh apvaah tantra hai jo nadi tathaa uski sahaayak dhaaraon dwaara nirmit jal pravaah kii vishesh vyavastha he
 Gravity is the tendency of a material to be attracted towards one another
 gurutvkarshan ke bare main pehali baar koi ganitiya sutara dene kii koshish ijak newton dwaara kii gayi jo ascharyajanak rup se sahi tha
 He proposed the theory of gravity
 newton ke siddhanth ko baad main albert oinstin dwaara saapekshata siddhant se badla gaya
 Earlier Varah Mihir had said that only some kind of power keeps things sticking to the earth
 gurutvkarshan siddhant par aadhunik kaam 16 veen ke ant main or 17 veen shatabdi kii shuruyaat main galileo galili ke kaam se shuru hua
 In his famous experiments used to drop balls from the Tower of Pisa, and later rotate the inclusions with careful measurement of the balls, Galileo showed that the gravitational acceleration is the same for all objects
 yah arestu ke vishwaas se ek bada prasthaan tha ki baari vastuon main ucch gurutvkarshan twaran hota he
 Galileo cited wind resistance as the reason that low-mass objects could fall into the atmosphere at a slower rate
 galileo ke kaam ne newton ke gurutv ke siddhant ke nirmaan ke liye manch taiyaar kiya Then Isaac Newton based on his fundamental discoveries that not only the earth, but every particle of the world keeps attracting every other particle towards itself
 do kanon ke bich kaary karanevaala aakarshan bal un kanon kii sanhatiyon ke gunanfal kaa samaanupati tathaa unke bich kii duuri ke varg kaa vyutkramanupati hota he
 The mutual attraction between the particles acting on gravity and the force generated by it is called the force of gravity
 newton dwaara pratipaadit uparyukt niyam ko newton kaa gurutvkarshan niyam kehete hai
 Sometimes this law is also called the inverse square law of gravity
 uparyukt niyam ko sutara rup main is prakaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : maan liya m1 or sanhati vaale m2 do pind paraspar d duuri par sthit hai
 The relation of the working force f between them will be: yahan g ek samaanupati niyatank he jiskaa maan sabhi padaarthon ke liye ek jaisaa rahata he
 This is called gravity constant
 is niyatank kii vimaa he or aankik maan prayukt ikai par nirbhar karata he
 By the formula, the force of attraction caused by the earth on a body can be calculated
 koi bhi vastu upar se girane par sidhi prithvi kii ore aati he
 It seems as if some untargeted and unknown power is pulling him towards the earth
 italy ke vaigyanik, gallilyyo gallilyaai ne sarvapratham is tathy par prakaash daalaa tha ki koi bhi pind jab upar se girtaa he tab vah ek niyat twaran se prithvi kii ore aata he
 This value of acceleration remains the same for all objects
 apane is nishkarsh kii pushti usne prayogon or ganitiya vivechanon dwaara kii he
 German astronomer Kepler gave three laws by studying the motion of planets
 kepler kaa pratham niyam: -sabhi grah surya ke chaaron ore dirghavrittakar kakshaon me chakkar lagate hai tathaa surya un kakshaon ke focus par hota he
 Second law - The line joining any planet to the Sun crosses the same area at the same time
 arthath prayek grah kii kshetreey chaal niyat rahati he
 That is, when the planet is away from the Sun, its speed decreases
 tritiy niyam : - prayek grah kaa surya kaa parikraman kaal kaa varg uski deergh vrittakar kaksha kii ardh-deergh aksh kii tritiy ghaat ke samaanupati hota he
 Gravity: "father, this earth, on which we dwell, rests upon?" Lilavati asked this question to her father Bhaskaracharya centuries ago
 iske uttar main bhaskaracharya ne kaha, "baale leelavati !, kuch log jo yah kehete hai ki yah prithvi sheshnag, kachua yaa hathi yaa anya kisi vastu par aadhaarit he to ve galat kehete hai
 Even if it is assumed that it rests on an object, the question remains, on which that object rests, and thus the cause of the cause and then its cause


 This sequence continues, then in jurisprudence This is called non-permanent defect
 leelavati ne kaha phir bhi yah prashn bana rahata he pitaaji ki prithvi kis cheez par tiki he? Then Bhaskaracharya said, why we cannot assume that the earth is not based on anything
 xxrep 5 
 yadi ham yah kahen ki prithvi apane hi bal se tiki he or ise gurutvkarshan shakti kah den to kya dosha he? Lilavati asked how this is possible
 tab bhaskaracharya siddhanth kii baat kehete hai ki vastuon kii shakti badi vicitra he
 Next says arthath prithvi main aakarshan shakti he
 Earth attracts heavy substances with its attraction power and due to attraction they fall to the ground
 par jab akaash main samaan takat chaaron ore se lage, to koi kaise gire? arthath akaash main grah niravlamb rahete hai kyonki vividh grahon kii gurutv shaktiyaan santulan banaae rakhti hai
