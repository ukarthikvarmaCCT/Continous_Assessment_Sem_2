 Indian astrology is made up of three parts - Astro, Samhita and Hora
 falit jyotish kaa doosraa naam he - horashastra
 Where developed rules are established on the resultant side of astrology, it is horastra
 udaahranarth: raashi, hora, dreshkan, navamaansh, chalit, dwadabhav, shodash varg, grahon ke digbal, kaal-bal, cheshtaa-bal, grahon ke dhaatu, dravya, kaarkatv, yogayog, ashtavarg, drushtibal, aayu yoga, vivaah yoga, naam sanyog, anisht yoga, striyon ke janmafal, unki mrityu nashtagarbha kaa lakshan prashn aadi horashastra ke antargat aate hai

 Horashastra well expresses the good or bad fruits done in earlier lives
 vrihajatak main varahamihir ne do baton par vishesh bal diya he- Horashastra does not say that the planets of a person's horoscope force him to do this or that, but that the horoscope only tells which direction the person's future is oriented
 saravali main kalyaan burma ne bhi kaha he ki jo jatakashastra he vahi horashastra he or yah niyati ke vishay main vivechan kaa paryaayavachi he

 There is evidence that leprosy does not develop in all people infected with M

 In short, penetration through the respiratory tract is the most likely route, although other routes, especially broken skin, cannot be ignored
 The CDC has expressed the following assumption about the transmission of the disease: "although the route of transmission of Hansen's disease remains uncertain, most researchers believe that M

 " In leprosy, it is difficult to define reference points for both the incubation period and the time of infection and the measurement of the onset of disease; The first one due to adequate immunological devices and the second due to the slow onset of the disease
 Despite this, various researchers have attempted to measure the incubation time for leprosy

 Although annual expansion as a measure of transmission — the number of new cases of leprosy received annually — is important, leprosy is characterized by long incubation periods, late diagnosis and early stages of the disease
 Leprosy is difficult to measure due to lack of laboratory equipment to be able to do this

 Registered prevalence is a useful representative indicator of the burden of the disease because it indicates the number of active cases of leprosy diagnosed with the disease at any point in time and receiving MDT treatment

 pichley varsh ke dauraan pahachaane gaye nae maamalon kii sankhya 296,499 thi
 The reason for this annual identification number exceeding its prevalence at the end of that year can be explained by the fact that a part of new cases completed their treatment within a year and hence they are no longer on the register
 The number of new cases identified globally continues to decline and in 2005 it decreased by 110,000 cases compared to the previous year

com / disabled-day-special-story / namakan prakriya : The Giriganga upland extends across three districts of Himachal Pradesh, Shimla, Solan and Sirmaur, and the Giri river drains most of its catchment into the Yamuna
 in kshetron ke log giri nadi ko giriganga ke naam se pukaarte hai
 The catchment area of giriganga is spread over 2,63,861
86 hectares from Yamuna on the border of Rajban, Uttaranchal and Himachal to Kupad mountain above Jubbal town of Shimla district
 giriganga, jubbal-rohdu rashtriya maarg par shimla se 80 kilometre dur khadaa-pathar naamak sthaan se lagbhag 5 kilometre kii duuri par sthit he
 In Shimla district, Giriganga joins the Yamuna river at Rampur Ghat after traveling 88 km from Solan to the east direction, after crossing the Kipar mountain, 40 kilometers in the south-west direction
 is yatra main yah nadi giriganga upatyaka kaa nirmaan karti he, yahan iske chaar mahatvapurn pahaluon, puranic, aitihaasik, jaivik or paristhitik, kaa ullekh he
 The legend related to the origin and nomenclature of Giriganga is as follows
 jubbal se ek yojan ke faasale par kupad kii pahari par koi muni tapasya karne aayaa
 He had Ganga water in a tumbe
 achaanak vah tumba gir gaya
 The word came out of the mouth of that sage, "O Ganesha, if you have refused to fall from my vessel on this dune, if you have fallen, then always flow by the name of Giriganga
" kalantar is romantic vanasthali main jubbal ke raja karm chandra ne giriganga kaa satkar ek talab banaakar kiya, or uske madhya main ek bhavy mandir main shri giriganga kii murti sthapit kii
 The temples built near the place of origin of Giriganga symbolize the faith of the people, mainly people come here to bathe on Baisakhi
 thiyog ke mipul main bhi ek tirth sthal he jahaan uske aas-paas ke log baisakhi ke pavitra tyohaar par giriganga main snaan karte hai
 At dawn, the Bhuteshvara deity here bathes, and later the site opens for all people to bathe
 isi tarah balag main, shimla se 65 kilometre dur, giriganga ke tat par, nagar style main bane pracheen mandir hai
 People believe that these temples were built by the Pandavas
 renuka, jo ek abhayaarany bhi he, puranic katha dwaara parashu ram ore unki maan renuka se judaa he
 People believe that during the Vedic period, the sage Jamadagni lived here along with his wife Renuka on the banks of the lake
 karthik maas main yahan se 9 kilometre dur jaamu gaanv se parashu ram ko palki main laayaa jaataa he, phir giriganga main snaan ke baad unhen anya devataaon ke saath renuka jhil ke paas laate hai, jahaan unka apni maan renuka se milan hota he
 The temples of Giriganga were built by King Karma Chandra of Jubbal, and would have been built a decade or two after 1854, when Karma Chandra received the throne of Jubbal by order of Queen Victoria
 haalanki shimla kii pahari riyasaton ke 1910 ke gajetir main in mandiron ke banavaane main jubbal ke raja padam chandra kaa naam he, kintu padam chandra kii vanshavali or miyaan gobardhan singh kii pustak, donon main giriganga main chaar mandiron kaa varnan he, jinke banane vaale padam chandra ke pita karm chandra hai
 The first temple is situated in the middle of a pond made of stone masonry and has a Ganga idol installed in it
 giriganga kaa pani ek taraf se pathar par ukere gaye kisi jantu ke sir se talab main girtaa he
 Just behind it are two small temples, one of Shiva and the other of Vishnu
 ek chauthaa mandir kaali kaa he, jo in se kuch dur tile par bana he
 According to Moran, at some time during the Mughal rule, most of the Giriganga uptika was in the princely state of Sirmour, and Kalsi was its capital
 usne aage likhaa he ki giri upatyaka main apane rajya ko majboot karte hue, 1610 main sirmaur ke raja ne giri ke is tarai ke kshetra ko chunaa, jahaan tauns nadi yamuna ke saath milti he
 Mian Gobardhan Singh writes that Udit Prakash, the king of Sirmour, chose Kalsi as his capital, where Ashoka also has the Sheela text
 itihaaskaar lakshmana thakur ke anusaar, yamuna ghati main kaalsi ke paas se nagar style giriganga upatyaka main faili hogi, jiske udhaaharan giriganga or balag ke mandir hai
 Ajay Bahadur Singh writes that during the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, King Buddha Prakash, who ruled Sirmaur from 1659 to 1678, sent from Nahan to Delhi and was known as Barfi Raja
 yahi nahin vah is kshetra se kai kism kii jadi-bootiyaan, shahad, kasturi, tathaa monal aadi kii saugat bhi jahanara ko bhejte the
 And he requested the emperor Aurangzeb to help him in taking back Kalsi from the king of Garhwal
 angreji shashan kaal se himalay kii jaivik smapda, visheshkar wanon ke dohan kii shuruyaat hui jisase pahari riyaasaten aarthik rup se sampann hui, jaise jubbal jiskaa giriganga udgam sthal, tathaa sirmaur jiskaa giriganga upatyaka ke adhikansh bhaag, par adhikaar tha
 Even after the independence of India, the Himalayan forests were not exploited
 singh, kothaari or pande ne giriganga upatyaka ke teen abhayaaranyon, churdhaar, chail or simbalwada, main jantuon evam paristhitiki kaa vistaar se varnan kiya he
 He says that the Chudhar Sanctuary is an area near the origin of Giriganga, which is blessed with forests
 is kshetra main himalay kaa kala bhaaluu, tendua, hanuman langur, rahesus bandar, bhartiya saahi, kakad, or ghoral mukhya jantu hai
 The musk deer, which used to be found in abundance in this area, is probably now negligible
 chail abhayaarany bhi giriganga ke jalgrahan ke kshetra kaa mukhya bhaag he or baan, chid or deodaar ke wanon se dhakaa he
 The animals and vegetation found in it resemble the churidhar
 simbalwada abhayaarany giriganga ke yamuna se sangam ke aas-paas kaa kshetra he jahaan saal ke jangal he jo kabhi ghaney honge, kintu ghani aabaadi ke kaaran ab parivartit ho chuke hai
 Lion, Leopard, Hanuman Langur, Rahesus monkey, Kakad, Chital, and Sambar are found in this sanctuary
 lekhakon kaa maananaa he ki simbalwada main kabhi hathi bhi aate the
 Caulette describes the vegetation of the Giriganga uptake in Falora simlensis, in the introduction of which Helmsley of the Rael Botanic Garden writes that the chud is 12,000 feet high in the region, which bears frequent names in this book
 is kshetra ke jantuon ke bare main or jaankaree sharma or siddhu dwaara banaayi suchi main he
 The mythological form of Giriganga has been put forward by the Institute of Folk Sciences, Dehradun, in the context of many such mythologies that highlight the ecological significance of this watershed, linking it with the guidelines for water use and conservation of Kashyapa
 pahaado par baraf, jiskaa abhi mogul kaal ke sandarbh main zikr aayaa, kaa ek pahalu jalsankat se judaa he
 Environmentalist Sundarlal Bahuguna took it to the people that the occurrence of forests in the mountains, decrease in snowfall, and soil erosion are interlinked
 vijay mishra kii vyakhya ke anusaar akaash se girte jal kii buundon kaa teevr veg valmiki ne ganga ke teevr veg se joda, or himalay ke aachhadit wanon kii tulana shiv kii jataaon se kar puranic katha rachi
 Valmiki has also described many types of animals
 yahi nahin use pataal tak le gaye, jiske liye sagar ke 60,000 mrit putron kii mukti or bhageerath kii tapasya kaa kathanak joda
 The Giriganga Upatika is the closest catchment area of the Himalayas, which not only supplies the water of the local people but is also connected to the water supply of Delhi, the capital of India
 is jalgrahan kshetra kaa bahut chota sa bhaag angrezon ne 19veen shatabdi main shimla main pani kii zaruuraton ko puraa karne ke liye chinhit kiya
 Later it was developed as Shimla Aquatic Sanctuary, and even today the area covered with dense forest of cedar is the largest source of clean water for Shimla, while other sources are prone to pollution
 giri nadi main anek bahuuddeshy jal-vidyut yojanayen bani hai, jisamen giri, baataa tathaa jalaal ke pani kaa upyog ho rahaa he
 The Giriganga uptake is part of the culture of Shimla, Solan and Sirmaur districts of Himachal Pradesh
 himalay ke wanon ke dohan kii shuruyaat jo angrejon ke shashan kaal main shuru hui, bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad saghan hoti chali gayi, jo paryaavaran or vikaas ke takaraav ke rup main ubhari he
 The conflict has also come up around the originating site of Giriganga, where a considerable part of the forest has been converted into apple orchards
 madhav gadgil ne bharat ke pashchimi ghat kii paristhitiki main aise badlaav ke mudde ko janata ke saamne rakhaa he
 The discovery of scientists associated with forest research suggests that the mixed forests of the origin of Giriganga have trees of cedar, kail, silver talispatra, prasral, mauru and kharshu
 yah van mrudaa jaev carbon sanchayan ke liye atyadhik mahatvapurn hai
 That is, these mixed forests, compared to other forests, contribute the most to preventing carbon from entering the atmosphere, which is necessary to reduce global warming
 aaj duniya ke sabhi desh tapakram main vruddhi or mausam main badlaav kii samasyaon se jujh rahe hai
 The harmful effects on human life due to the increasing temperature in the atmosphere and the changes in the weather is a matter of concern for all, keeping in mind that all the countries of the world met in Paris in 2015 and signed several agreements proposals, a collective The aim was to bring the temperature of the earth to a level before industrialization
 is sandarbh main vayumandal main badhati carbon kii maatra ek bada ghatak he, kyonki yah prithvi ke chaaron ore tapakram ko badhaati he
 One way to reduce this is by storing carbon in the ground
 isamen kuch vishesh paristhitikeey tantra hi yogadan dete hai, jo giriganga ke udgam sthal main he
 But now the apple orchards have spread in it
 nyayavidon kii raay main giriganga udgam sthal ke aas-paas, or himachal ke anya kshetron main, gramin logon dwaara van kshetra main atikaraman sahi nahin he, or unhone najayas kabjon ko hataane ke aadesh die hai
 On the other hand, some people associated with the organization of environment are sensitive to the encroachment of forest land in Himachal and are in favor of an early solution to this problem
 is sandabh main kisaan netaa rakesh singha ne chote or garib bagwanon ke hiton kii andekhi kii baat rakhi, or vaikalpik vyavastha karne kaa suzav diya
 Felix Pedal poses alternative development challenges for those close to forests or forest-dependent people, such as Dongria flashes of central India
 giriganga ke udgam sthal ke aasapaas visheshkar pundar pargana ke gaanv ke log, swabhimani or mehnatee hai iskaa varnan angrejon ne bhi kiya he
 Giving information about this historical incident, Sharma wrote that Amar Singh Thapa, the leader of the Gorkhas, in 1910, gave free permission to loot the villages of the region, Madaog, Jubbad, Ghadin, Matal, Bamta, Mamvi, Kasha, etc
 But these villagers fought the Gorkha army
 yah log lambe arase se vikaas se vanchit rahe hai
 The Paris Agreement recognizes that alternative avenues of development should be found for communities in developing countries, which are affected by environmental protection

 The year of 107 BCE or the year before his birth is represented as the basis of the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous

 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India

 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kaliyug Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc

 Gradually, this meeting of Devendranath started becoming popular and some influential Hindus became its members
 har saptaah isaki ek baithak hoti thi jisamen bhagavadbhajan or pravachan hote the
 In 1842, Devendranath made his debut in the Brahmas Samaj
 raja rammohan raay ke england chale jane par brahmsamaj shithil padane laga
 Every week many types of people gathered in the society and went away listening to the Bhajan discourse
 isse adhik kuch nahin
 Devendranath's arrival in the Brahma Samaj brought new life to him
 san 1847 main unhone tatvabodhini sabha ko ek pratigya se parichit karaayaa
 In this vow, it was said that each member of the Brahmas Samaj would be saved from evil deeds, would worship God with a sincere heart and would offer something to the Brahmas Samaj on the occasion of family happiness
 is pratigya par hastakshar karanevaale devendranath pratham the
 In Brahmasamaj meetings there would still be recitation of Vedas and Upanishads, there would be a sermon in Bengali and everyone would sing a Bengali mantra or bhajan together

 Becoming respectful towards him and acting according to his will is the worship of Brahma
 'brahmadharm' main jis dharmik pranali kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya vah mukhyat: upanishdon par aadhaarit thi
 Some new ideas and some popular theories of Hinduism were also included in it
 brahmsamaj ke ek nae sadsy keshavchand sen the
 Some followers of Keshava devoted their entire time to Brahmasamaja to propagate Brahmanism
 ye log saare bengal main gum ghumkar apana sandesh dene lage
 Keshav himself also went to Madras and Bombay in this regard
 in prayatnon kaa fal yah hua ki 1865 ke ant tak bengal, punjab, madras tathaa pashchimottar praant main brahmsamaj kii 54 shakhaayen khul gayi
 Devendranath, Keshav and other young men were very happy with this work
 par sheeghra hi keshavchand sen ke vidhwavivaah tathaa antarjaatiy vivaah aadi unnatisheel vichaaron se maharishi devendranath asantusht ho gaye
 Thus, in 1865 itself, the Brahmasamaja broke out and two ideologies were formed in it
 devendranath ne keshavchand sen tathaa unke saathiyon ko padchyut kar diya
 On this, Keshav Chandra founded the 'indian Brahmasamaj'
 devendranath tathaa unke saathiyon kaa samaaj ab 'adisamaj' kahalaane laga
 'adisamaj' stayed away from any kind of propaganda and social reform and believed in monotheism
 adisamaj kii pratishtha devendranath thakur ke vaiyaktik prabhaav ke kaaran kuch samay tak chalati rahi
 After this, Maharishi Devendranath handed over the work of the society to a management committee

 Gorakhnath or Gorakshnathji Maharaj was a Nath Yogi before the first century, Guru Gorakhnathji traveled all over India and composed many books
 gorakhnath ji kaa mandir uttar pradesh ke gorakhpur nagar main sthit he
 The district is named Gorakhpur after Gorakhnath
 guru gorakhnath ji ke naam se hi nepal ke gorkhaon ne naam paaya
 There is a district of Gorkha in Nepal, that district is also named after Gorkha
 mana jaataa he ki guru gorakhnath sabase pehle yaheen dikhe the
 There is a cave in Gorkha district which has the foot sign of Gorakhnath and a statue of him
 yahan har saal baishakh poornima ko ek utsav manaaya jaataa he jise 'rot mahotsav' kehete hai or yahan mela bhi lagata he
 The following 40 books were discovered in the search of Dr
 Baratwal, which is said to be Gorakhnath-composed
 dow badthwaal ne bahut chaanbin ke baad inamen pratham 14 granthon ko asandigdh rup se pracheen mana, kyonki inkaa ullekh praayah sabhi pratiyon main mila
 The thirteenth book 'gian Chantisa' could not come in the collection edited by him due to not being found in time, but he has published the rest of the thirteen as Gorakhnath's compositions
 pustaken ye hai- Many scholars in India have said many things about the time of Matsyendranath and Gorakhnath
 vastutah inke or inke samasamyik siddh jalandharnath or krishnapad ke sambandh main anek dantakathaayen prachlit hai
 Many things can be clearly known from the practice of Gorakhnath and Matsyendranath-related stories
 pratham yah ki matsyendranath or jalandharanath samasayik the; duusari yah ki matsyendranath gorakhnath ke guru the or jalandharnath kanupa yaa krishnapad ke guru the; teesri yah kii matsyendranath kabhi yoga-maarg ke pravartak the, phir sanyogvash aise ek aachaar main sammilit ho gaye the jisamen striyon ke saath abaadh sansarg mukhya baat thi - sambhawatah yah vamachari sadhana thi;-chauthi yah ki shuru se hi jalandharnath or kanipa kii sadhana-paddati matsyendranath or gorakhnath kii sadhana-paddati se bhinn thi
 It is clear that if the time of any one is known, then the time of the remaining Siddhas will be easily known
 samay maaloom karne ke liye kai yuktiyaan di ja sakati hai
 Let us consider them one by one
 in dantakthaon se sambhddha aitihaasik vyaktiyon kaa kaal bahut samay janaa hua rahata he
 Many historical persons are considered to be the disciples of Gorakhnath
 unke samay kii sahaayta se bhi gorakhnath ke samay kaa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Briggs has divided the tales based on these legends and the four broad divisions as follows- parantu upar ke pramaanon ke aadhaar par nathmarg ke aadi pravartakon kaa samay naveen shatabdi kaa madhya bhaag hi uchit jaan padataa he
 In this passage, the earlier siddhas have also been inserted later and hence there are dozens of such legends regarding Gorakhnath, which, assuming historical facts, cause date-related problems
