 a closed watershed or inclusive watershed is a geography called a watershed area in which rain or melting ice water collects and stops at a lake, marshy area or dry area instead of flowing into the sea or ocean through a river
 aam taur par jo bhi pani dharti par barish yaa himpat ke kaaran padataa he wo nadiyon, nehron or jharanon ke dwaara oonche ilaakon se nichle ilaakon kii ore bahata he
 These moving groups of water keep converging with each other until a single big river is formed
 phir yah nadi aage chalakar kisi sagar main mil jaati he
 But in areas which are isolated from the seas due to slopes, mountains or deserts, the water stops at the lowest place
 aise sthanon par yaa to jhilein ban jaati hai yaa dharti pani ko sokh leti he
 Some of the largest lakes in the world have some lakes formed due to such closed watersheds, such as the Aral Sea and the Caspian Sea
 angrezi main band jalsambar ko "endorheik basin" kaha jaataa he
 Geographically it is seen that the closed watershed areas are often also desert areas
 aisa isliye he ke agar pani ek hi sthaan par ikkatha hone se uski maatra badhati hi jaae to antat pani apane or samudr ke bich kii rukawat ko parajeet kar hi detaa he
 Scientists speculate that at some time Krishna Sagar was such a closed watershed lake which broke its boundaries due to rising water and got into the Mediterranean Sea
 khule jalsambharon main jo namak or anya padaarth milte rahete hai ve aage chalakar sagar main bah jate hai
 This does not happen in closed watersheds
 pani main mili namak or anya padaarth in jhiilon yaa shushk kshetron main jaakar jamaa hoten rahete hai
 Hence the closed Jalasambhar lakes become very saline over time
 bharat ke rajasthan rajya main ajmer ke paas sthit sambar jhil thik aise hi band jalsambar kii ek khaari jhil he
 Pollution on such lakes also has a very bad effect because the pollutants continue to collect and grow instead of dispersing into the sea

 About 21% of Australia's area is closed watersheds, while in North America, closed watersheds cover only 5% of the area
 puure vishwa kaa lagbhag 18% jamini kshetrafal band jalsanbharon se grast he
 Closed watersheds with the largest area of the world are found in the interior of Asia
 kuch sookhe kshetron main band jalsambar kaa pani namak or anya lavan to le aata he, lekin garmi or shushkta ke kaaran tezi se vashpit hota rahata he
 At some places, the water flows only in one season or after flowing for some yoga, the geographical conditions change and stop coming
 aise shushk jhil vaale ilaaqon main namak kii moti or sakht parat jamkar ek vistrut samtal maidan bana detii he jo milon-koson tak failaa hota he
 Because such salt fields are perfectly flat and very large, they are used by fast trains to set a speed record
 kabhi-kabhi band jalsambharon kii jhiilon kaa aakaar mausam ke saath badalte pani ke bahaav ke saath-saath badalata rahata he
 These lakes shrink during the dry season and increase due to rains or snowfall
 kabhi-kabhi jab pani kam hota he to ek jhil kai choti jhiilon main bat jaati he or phir barishon ke baad pani badhane par milakar phir ek badi jhil ban jaati he
 If economic growth in an area is accompanied by water-resistant dams or canals for irrigation that reduce the flow of water into closed watershed lakes, these lakes often shrink and become very small
 aisi sthiti main un aabaadiyon par bahut karaab asar padataa he jo apane vyavsaay yaa jivan ke liye in jhiilon par nirbhar hon
 Something similar has happened with the Aral Sea in Central Asia

 The Pangsau Pass is the most important mountain pass of the Patkai Mountains and the Ledo Road connecting India to Burma originates from this pass

 is pad par puure saat baras rahakar, jisamen use sultan ko atyant nikat se dekhne kaa avasar mila, ebn battoota ne har ghatana ko bade dhyaan se dekha suna
 In 1342, Muhammad Tughluq sent him to the emperor of China as his ambassador, but just a few days after his departure from Delhi, he fell into great calamity and reached Calicut with great objections, saving his life with great difficulty
 aisi paristhiti main sagar kii raah china janaa vyarth samajhakar vah bhubharg se yatra karne nikal padaa or lanka, bengal aadi pradeshon main ghumta china ja pahunchaa

 Cleanup-jargon atrial septal defect is a form of atrial fibrillation that occurs between the left atrial septum and enables blood flow right between congenital heart defects
 The interatrial septum is the tissue that divides the right and left
 If without this septum, or there is this defect in the septum, it is possible for the blood to travel from the left side of the heart vice versa, or to the right side of the heart
 Regardless of the inter-atrial circulation of bi-directional, arterial and venous blood in the mixture This results

 The forearm caused by pulmonary hypertension will cause the right ventricle to withstand the systole pressure increase in addition to the rotated blood rise from the left forearm that rotates the right ventricle
 The right ventricle will be forced to generate high pressure to recover from pulmonary hypertension
 This dilation may lead to ventricular right-sided failure or pressure-sided superfluidity

 If left undisciplined, the pressure in the right side of the heart will be greater than the left side of the heart
 This will cause the pressure in the right atrium to be higher than the pressure in the left atrium
 This will fill the pressure gradient and reverse atrial septal disorder, will reverse shunt, left shunt from one right will not be available
 This phenomenon is known as Isenger syndrome

 arthshaastra main, angreji shabd stagflation us sthiti ko darshata he jab mudrasphiti kii dar or berogari dar donon hi ucch rahete hai
 This is a difficult situation for a country financially, since, at the moment both inflation and economic stability problems arise simultaneously and no macroeconomic policy can simultaneously focus on these problems at the same time
 Can
 do shabdon kii dhvaniyon se milakar bane shabd stagflation kii utpatti ke liye aam taur par british raajnneetijna len mcliod ko jimmedaar tehraaya jaataa he, jinhone 1965 main is shabd ko vahaan kii sansad main die gaye apane ek bhaashan ke dauraan gadha
 yah avadharana aanshik rup se isliye bhi ullekhneey he kyonki, yuddh ke baad ke sthool-aarthik siddhant main, mudrasphiti or mandi ko paraspar anany mana jaataa tha or isliye bhi kyonki mudrasphitijanit mandi aam taur par bahut mushkil sabit hui he or ek baar shuru ho jane par, maanav sandarbh main or saath hi bajet ghate ke rup main, iskaa unmoolan bahut mahangaa padataa he
 a common measure of stagflation in the political arena, called the Misery Index, was used to reverse the 1976 and 1980 presidential elections in the United States
 arthshaastriyon ne, mudrasphitijanit mandi kyon hoti he is par do pramukh spashtikaran pradaan kiye hai
 First, an inflationary slowdown can result when the productive capacity of an economy is reduced by sudden unfavorable supply, such as an increase in oil prices for an oil-importing country
 Due to such a sudden unfavorable supply, prices also tend to rise at the same time and at the same time a greater increase in production value and lower profits provide a slower pace to the economy
 is prakaar kii mudrasphitijanit mandi ek niti sambandhi duvidha ko saamne laati he kyonki jin kriyaaon ko mudrasphiti se jujhane ke liye taiyaar kiya jaataa he ve aarthik sthirataa ko or badtar bana dete hai or iske vipareet
 Second, both stability and inflation can be the result of unfair macroeconomic policies
 udhaaharan ke taur par, kendriya banken, dhan aapurti ke atyadhik vikaas kii anumati dekar mudrasphiti kaa kaaran ban sakati he, or sarkaar maal bazaar or shram bazaar ke atyadhik viniman dwaara sthirataa kaa kaaran ban sakati he, in donon main se koi bhi kaarak mudrasphitijanit mandi kaa kaaran ban sakati he
 Excessive growth in the money supply that is taken to such an extreme that it has to be reversed suddenly can clearly be a reason
 charam sarkari nitiyaan jo kharchon ko vyapak rup se badhaati he, jaise, sangrakshanvaadi aayaat shulk, paryaavaran niyamon main mahatvapurn vruddhi yaa nunatam vetan main atyadhik vruddhi bhi iskaa kaaran ho sakati he
 An analysis of the global stagflation of the 1970s offered both types of explanations: It began with a steep rise in oil prices, but continued even after central banks responded heavily to the resulting recession
 Used stimulating monetary policy, resulting in a severe wage-price upturn
 1960 ke dashak tak kai kinesian arthshaastriyon ne mudrasphitijanit mandi kii sambhaavna kii upeksha kii, kyonki aitihaasik anubhavon ke aadhaar par yah dekha gaya ki ucch berogari nimna mudrasphiti ke saath vishisht rup se judi hui he or iske vipareet 
 dharna yah thi ki maal kii ucch maang keemton ko badhata he or saath hi fermon ko adhik karmi niyukt karne ke liye prerit karata he; or usee tarah ucch rojgaar, maang main vruddhi karata he
 However, in the 1970s and 1980s, when the stagflation receded, it became clear that the relationship between inflation rates and employment levels was stable: it did not necessarily mean that the Phillips relationship was removed
 could
 vyapak arthshaastri kinesian siddhant ko lekar or sanshayi ho gaye or kenetiunon ne hi mudrasphitijanit mandi kaa vivaran dhundne ke liye swayan hi apane vichaaron par punah vichaar kiya
 Details for the removal of the Phillips curve were initially given by the monetary economists Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps
 donon ne tark diya ki jab kaaryakarta or companiyaan adhik mudrasphiti kii ummid karne lagate hai, philips vakr upar kii ore chalaa jaataa he 
 unka suzav vishesh rup se yah tha ki yadi mudrasphiti kai varshon tak chali, karmchaaree or companiyaan vetan samjhauta vaarta ke dauraan iskaa dhyaan rakhane lagengi, jisase karmchaariyon ke vetan or companiyon kii laagat main tezi se vruddhi hoti he or falswaroop mudrasphiti main bhi or vruddhi hoti he
 While the idea was a serious criticism of Keynesian theory, it was gradually adopted by most Keynesians and incorporated into new Keynesian economic models
 samakaleen kinesian vishleshan kaa tark tha ki mudrasphitijanit mandi ko samgr maang ko prabhavit karne vaale or samgr aapurti ko prabhavit karne vaale do vibhedak karkon se samajha ja saktaa he
 While monetary and fiscal policy can be used to stabilize an economy in the face of aggregate demand fluctuations, they are not useful for coping with aggregate supply fluctuations
 vishesh rup se, samgr aapurti ke liye ek pratikul jhatka, jaise tel kii keemton main vruddhi bhi mudrasphitijanit mandi ko janm de saktaa he
 New Keynesian theory distinguished two different types of inflation: demand-traction and cost-pressure
 Inflationary recession, in this view, is caused by cost-push inflation
 cost-push mudrasphiti tab hoti he jab koi bal yaa sthiti utpaadan kii laagat ko badha detaa he
 This may be due to government policies, or may be purely due to external factors such as lack of natural resources or war
 aapurti siddhant nav-kinesian cost-push model par aadhaarit he or mudrasphitijanit mandi ko maang-aapurti bazaar sameekaran ke maang paksh ke mahatvapurn avarodhon ke liye uttaradaayi tehraata he, udhaaharan ke taur par, jab achaanak mahatvapurn vastuon, prakritik sansadhano, yaa vastuon or sevaaon ke utpaadan ke liye aavashyak prakritik puunji kii vaastavik yaa saapeksh kami ho jaati he
 Other factors can also be the cause of supply problems, for example, social and political conditions such as policy changes, acts of war, socialist restrictive or nationalist control over production
 Under this view, it is believed that stagflation occurs only when an adverse supply shock occurs, which subsequently causes a spurt in the prices of goods and services
 In technical terms, this results in a contraction or negative shift of the economy's overall supply curve
 sansaadhan abhaav paridrishy main, mudrasphitijanit mandi tab falit hoti he jab aarthik vikaas kachche maal kii ek simit aapurti ke kaaran baadhit hoti he
 That is, when the actual or relative supply of basic materials, minerals, arable land, timber, etc
), is reduced in response to increasing or constant demand and / or cannot be increased sufficiently rapidly
 sansaadhan kii kami ek vaastavik bhautik kami yaa ek saapeksh kami ho sakati he jo karon yaa kharaab maudrik niti ke kaaran ho sakati he jisane kachche maal kii keemat yaa uplabdhta ko prabhavit kiya
 This is consistent with the cost-push inflation factors of neo-keynesian theory
 yah is tarah se hota he ki aapurti aghat ke baad, arthvyavastha pehle apni gati banaae rakhane kii koshish karegi - yani upabhokta or vyapaar apane maang kaa str banaae rakhane ke liye ucch mulya kaa bhugtan karne lagenge
 kendriya bank mudra aapurti main vruddhi karte hue, ise badha saktaa he udhaaharan ke liye ek mandi se nipatane ke prayaas main byaaj daron ko kam karne ke dwaara
 vardhit mudra aapurti, maal or sevaaon kii maang ke liye samarthan detii he, haalanki mandi ke dauraan maang main saamaanya rup se giravat aati he
 In the Keynesian model, higher prices would induce an increase in the supply of goods and services
 However, during a supply shock, the supply does not react as it normally would under these price pressures
 isliye, mudrasphiti uchhalati he or utpaadan gir jaataa he, jisase mudrasphitijanit mandi kaa nirmaan hota he
 After Richard Nixon introduced wage and price controls on 15 August 1971, the initial wave of cost-pressure shocks in commodities was blamed as the cause of rising prices
 us samay uddhrut kiya gaya shaayad sabase kukhyat kaarak tha 1972 main peruviai ankavi matsay kii vifaltaa, jo pashudhan kii khuraaq kaa ek pramukh strot tha
 The second major setback was the 1973 oil crisis when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries disrupted worldwide oil supplies
 Both events, combined with the overall energy crisis that characterized the 1970s, resulted in actual or relative scarcity of raw materials
 mulya niyantranon ne parinamswaroop kharid ke bindu par kami paidaa kar di, jisase udhaaharan ke taur par, indhan steshnon par upabhoktaaon kii kataron or udyog ke liye utpaadan laagat main vruddhi hui
 Under this set of principles, the solution to stagflation is to restore material supplies
 ek bhautik kami ke maamle main, mudrasphitijanit mandi ko kam kiya jaataa he yaa to khoye hue sansadhano ko pratisthapit karke yaa urja kshamta or aarthik utpaadakta ko badhaane ke tareeke viksit karke taaki kam nivishti ke saath adhik utpaada kaa utpaadan kiya ja sake
 udhaaharan ke liye, 1970 ke dashak ke uttarrardh main or 1980 ke dashak ke purvardh main tel kii kami ko urja kshamta or vaishvik tel utpaadan donon main vruddhi se raahat mili thi
 This aspect, combined with the adjustment in monetary policies, was helpful in ending the inflationary recession
 sthool arthshaastra kaa ek vishuddh rup se navashastreey drishy is vichaar ko khaarij karata he ki maudrik niti kaa vastav main koi prabhaav hota he
 Neoclassical macro economists argue that real economic quantities, such as real products, employment and unemployment, can only be determined by real factors
 nammaatr ke kaarak jaise mudra aapurti main parivartan keval nammaatr kii prabhavit karne vaali vasteen jaise mudrasphiti ko hi prabhavit karti he
 This neoclassical idea that nominal factors do not have a real effect is called 'monetary neutrality' or 'classical contradiction'
 jaisaa ki navashastreey drushtikon kahata he ki berogari jaise tathy anivaary rup se mudrasphiti jaisi maamuli ghatana se asambandhit hai, ek navashastreey arthshaastri 'sthirataa' or 'mudrasphiti' ke liye do alag-alag vyakhya kii peshkash karegaa
 sthirataa ke navashastreey spashtikaran main shaamil he, aksham sarkari vinimay yaa berozegaron ke liye adhik laabh jo logon ko naukari dhundne ke liye kam preranamulak pradaan karata he
 Another neoclassical account of sustainability is given by the real business cycle theory, in which any reduction in labor productivity makes less efficient work
 mudrasphiti kaa mukhya navashastreey spashtikaran bahut saral he: yah tab hota he jab maudrik adhikari dhan kii aapurti ko bahut zyada badha dete hai
 In the neoclassical approach, the real factor that determines output and unemployment affects only the aggregate supply curve
 nammaatr ke kaarak jo ki mudrasphiti ko nirdhaarit karte hai keval kul maang vakr ko hi prabhavit karte hai
 When some adverse change in the real factor shifts the aggregate supply curve to the left, at the same time that inappropriate monetary policies shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, the result is stagflation
 is tarah se arthvyavastha ke shastreey drushtikon ke tahat mudrasphitijanit mandi kaa mukhya vivaran ek saadhaaran rup se nitigat trutiyaan hai jo mudrasphiti or shram bazaar donon ko prabhavit karti he
 Ironically, a very clear argument in favor of the classical interpretation of stagflation was provided by Keynes himself
 1919 main, jon menard keens ne apni kitaab da economic konsequences of da pis main varnit kiya ki mudrasphiti or aarthik sthirataa europe ko apni jakad main le rahi he
 Keynes wrote: keens ne sarkaar dwaara mudra ke mudran or mudrasphiti ke bich ke sambandh ko spasht rup se ingit kiya
 Keynes also pointed out how government price controls discourage production
 keens ne german sarkaar ke ghate or mudrasphiti ke bich sambandh ko vistrut rup se varnit kiya
 While most economists believe that changes in the money supply may have some real effect in the short run, neoclassical and neo-keynesian economists agree that changes in the money supply have no long-term consequences
 isliye, jo arthshaastri khud ko nav-kinesian maanate hai aam taur par yah maanate hai ki dirghakaal main mudra tatasth he
 In other words, where neoclassical and neo-keynesian models are often seen as competing ideologies, they can also be seen as two distinct descriptions that fit two different time horizons
 aaj kai mukhyadhara kii pathyapustaken nav-kinesian model ko alpakaal main arthvyavastha kaa sateek vivaran maanati hai, us samay jab keemten 'avaruddh' ho or navashastreey model ko ek dirghakaalin arthvyavastha ke liye sateek vivaran maanate hai, jab keemton ke paas purna rup se samyojit hone ke liye paryaapt samay ho
 Therefore, today when mainstream economists can often attribute adverse changes in supply to short-term stagflation, they will not accept this as an explanation for long-term stagflation
 a more prolonged stagflation would be described as an effect of unfair government policies: excessive regulation of the product market and labor market that results in long-term stagnation and excessive growth of the money supply results in long-term inflation
 raajnneetik arthshaastri jonathan nitzan or shimshaun bichler ne mudrasphitijanit mandi ko ek siddhant ke, jise ve vibhedak sanchayan kehete hai, bhaag ke rup main ek spashtikaran prastaavit kiya he, jo kahata he ki companiyaan ausat laabh ko or puunjikaran ko badhaane ke bajaay unhen peeche chhod dene ke maukey talash karti he
 According to this theory, the timing of mergers and acquisitions oscillates with the timing of stagflation
 jab vilay or adhigrahan raajnneetik rup se saadhy nahin rah jate hai,, mudrasphitijanit mandi ko pratiyogita se bhi ucch saapeksh laabh ke ek vikalp ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 With increasing mergers and acquisitions, the power to implement stagflation increases
 mudrasphitijanit mandi ek saamaajik sankat ke rup main prakat hoti he, udhaaharan ke taur par 70 ke dashak or 2008-2006 main hue tel sankat kii avadhi ke dauraan
 tathaapi, mudrasphitijanit mandi main mudrasphiti, sabhi companiyon ko samaan rup se prabhavit nahin karti
 pramukh companiyaan pratiyogiyon kii tulana main tezi se apane swayan kii keemton main vruddhi kar sakati hai
 While no one appears to be benefiting overall, the major companies differ, improving their positions with higher relative profits and higher relative capitalism
 mudrasphitijanit mandi kisi vaastavik aapurti sadame ke kaaran nahin hoti he, balki yah us saamaajik sankat ke kaaran hoti he jo ek aapurti sankat kii ore sanket karti he
 It is mostly a 20th and 21st century phenomenon used primarily by the "wappendollar-petrodollar Coalition" that produced or used the Middle East crisis for economic interests
 maang-khinchaav mudrasphitijanit mandi siddhant is vichaar kaa padtaal karata he ki mudrasphitijanit mandi vishesh rup se maudrik jatke se utpann ho sakati he, bina kisi bhi samavarti aapurti jatke yaa aarthik utpaadan kshamta main nakaaratmak badlaav ke
 maang-khinchaav siddhant ek aise paridrishy kaa varnan karata he jahaan mudrasphitijanit mandi mudrasphiti ko janm dene vaali ek maudrik niti karyanvayan avadhi ke baad ho saktaa he
 This theory was first proposed in 1999 by Eduardo Loyo of Harvard University's John F
 Kennedy School of Gorment

 aapurti-paksh arthshaastriyon ne kaha ki mudrasphiti utprerit vaastavik kar daron main vruddhi se mudrasphitijanit mandi ke sankuchan ghatak falit hote hai Inflationary recession becomes a dilemma for monetary policy, when policies meant to spur economic growth generally begin to push inflation further, while policies used to combat inflation further collapse an already declining economy
 She gives
 aarthik vikaas ko badhaane ke liye ek mahatvapurn aarthik tantra he byaaj daron main kami, jo upabhoktaaon ke liye credit par utpaadon ko kharidne kii or kaarobaar ke utpaadan vistaaran ke liye udhaar lene kii laagat kam kar detaa he
 Although it can increase economic activity, it also leads to increase in inflation
 mudrasphiti kam karne ke liye maudrik vyavastha, byaaj daron ko kam karke kii jaati he, jo upabhoktaaon ke liye udhaar par utpaada kharidari karne or vyapaar main utpaadan vistaaran ke liye rin kii laagat ko badha detaa he
 While this may reduce inflation, it may result in a decrease in economic activity
 mudrasphitijanit mandi ek samasya keval tabhi banati he jab mukhya maudrik niti saadhan jo gharelu arthvyavastha ke kendriya bank disha-nirdeshon kii sahaayta karne ke liye uplabdh he, istemaal kiye jane par adhik seemaant phaayde kii tulana adhik seemaant nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 Ultimately, the central bank can either stimulate the economy or try to take possession through a mechanism to adjust its main instrument, the domestic interest rate
 vikaas ko behatar banane ke liye ek vikalp ko lagu kiya ja saktaa he, lekin kya yah pranaligat mudrasphiti ko jwalit kar paata he? ek vikalp ko lagu kiya ja saktaa he jo mudrasphiti se ladane main sahaayak ho, lekin yah kitni buree tarah se vikaas ke saath takaraayega? mudrasphitijanit mandi ke rup main uchit rup se varnit avadhi ke dauraan donon hi samasyaayein ek saath astitv main hoti hai
 In modern times, stagflation can only occur if the central bank uses all possible tools to achieve both goals, using the best quantitative measures it can have in its possession
 Major economic conditions of unusual proportions have already created a near-crisis on both fronts before the inflationary recession begins again
 Inflationary recession is the name of the dilemma that prevails when the central bank declares itself powerless to fix either inflation or stability
 rajkoshiya niti ke liye samasya ab tak kam spasht he
 Both revenue and expenditure rise with inflation and with balanced budget politics, they fall as the pace of growth slows
 jab tak kii mudrasphitijanit mandi ke kaaran rajasav yaa kharche par ek antar prabhaav nahin hota, bajet ke santulan par mudrasphitijanit mandi kaa prabhaav puri tarah se spasht nahin he
 One stream of thought holds that the best policy mix is one in which the government promotes growth by increasing spending and reducing taxes, while the central bank grapples with inflation through higher interest rates
 jo bhi siddhant prayukt he, rajkoshiya or maudrik nitiyon ke bich samanvay kaayam karnaa aasaan kaary nahin he
 Inflationary recession undermined confidence in Keynesian consensus and re-emphasized the behavior of microeconomics, particularly neoclassical economics, with efforts to establish the roots of macroeconomics in microeconomics
 The rise of conservative theories of economics, including currencyism, can be traced to the perceived failure of Keynesian policies to fight stagflation or to the satisfaction of economists and policy makers

 bahya jagat kii apeksha antarjagat kii shakti adrishy hokar bhi kahin adhik prakhar or prabhaavapurn hoti he
 It is not visible what thoughts are going on in the brain, but the entire role of business is made in the world itself
 antarjagat vishaal or viraat he, usase ek vyakti hi nahin, bade samudaay bhi prerit or prabhavit hote hai
 People usually use their five senses - eye, ear, nose, tongue and skin to get information, but there are also people in the world who get information through unusual methods without the use of senses
 asaamaanya vidhiyon ke dwaara jaankaree praapt karne kii is kshamta ko paramanovigyaan atindriya bodh kii sangya detaa he
 In other words, it can be said that psychic perception is the sixth sense of a person
 atindriya bodh se praapt jaankaree vartmaan, bhoot yaa bhavishya main se kisi bhi kaal kii ho sakati he
 History of psychic perception san 1870 main jiyological socity ke faillo sar richard bartan ne sarvapratham atindriya bodh shabd kaa prayog kiya
 Again in 1870 itself, the term psychic perception was used by a French researcher
 1892 main dow
 paal jori dwaara is shabd kaa prayog sammohan se prabhavit vyaktiyon ke varnan ke liye kiya gaya
 It is a general belief that a person affected by hypnosis exhibits psychic perception
 munich ke apthalamologist dow
 rudolph tishnar ne chaitanyata ke bhautikeekaran ke liye san 1920 ke dashak main atindriya bodh shabd kaa Used
 antat: san 1930 main america ke paramanovaigyanik jebi rine ne atindriya bodh shabd ko lokapriy bana diya
 Rinne was the first paramedic who did many experiments in the laboratory on psychic perception
 atindriya bodh ke pradarshan se gyaat hota he ki bhautik niyamon ke dwaara isaki vyakhya karnaa atyant dushkar he
 Thought wave man main jab koi tarang uthati he to manushya ko iskaa ahsaas nahin rahata ki vah kya kar rahaa he or use kya karnaa he? vichaar kii aisi tarang kaa prabhaav vicitra hota he
 But the opposite effect is concentration
 ekaagratha bahut badi shakti he
 The person in whom the power of concentration develops, all his power becomes concentrated and that concentrated power explodes
 jaise kisi shilakhand ko nikaalane ke liye barood kaa visphot kiya jaataa he, vaise hi shakti ke aavaran ko hataane ke liye yah visphot kiya jaataa he
 Measures of psychic practice atindriya gyaan kii sadhana ke anek upaay hai
 There are two of them - restraint of the senses and stabilization or concentration
 sthirikaran man kaa bhi hota he or vaani tathaa sharir kaa bhi, yahi ekaagratha he
 When the vibrations of the mind, speech and body cease, then the obstacles are removed
 chanchalta sabase badi baadha he
 The moving mirror is not visible in the mouth
 sthir darpan main hi munh dekha ja saktaa he
 When consciousness is stable, many things can be seen in it
 jab chetana chanchal hoti he, tab usamen kuch bhi dikhaai nahin detaa
 Choice and concentration teesraa upaay he- nirvikalp hona
 Nirvikalpa means that the flow of thoughts is broken
 ekaagratha or nirviklpata main bahut bada antar he
 Concentration means to stick to a single point
 yah bhi ek prakaar kii chanchalta to he hi
 We stagnated on ego or aum, still there is fickleness
 vahaan na koi vikalp hota he, na shabd, na chintan or manan
 There is neither elation nor imagination in a neutral state
 baahar kaa koi bhaan nahin rahata
 It only involves introversion, self-realization, deep-seeping
 is sthiti main aavaran bahut jaldi tuutata he
 The cover is strengthened by choices
 vikalp, vikalp ko janm detaa he
 It produces wave
 jab vikalp samaapt ho jaataa he, tab The cover does not get nutrition
 vah swat: ksheen ho jaataa he
 In the absence of diet, as the body is weak, similarly in the absence of nutrition, the cover becomes weak
 jin logon ne ekaagratha sadhi he, nirviklpata or samta sadhi he, unhen hi atindriya gyaan kii prapti hui he
 There are three types of imperceptible knowledge - period knowledge, mind-knowledge and mere knowledge
 in sabaki prapti ke liye samta kii sadhana ek anivaary shart he
 As long as raga-malice or loveliness- apriyata ke dwandv main aadmi ulajhaa rahata he, tab tak aavaran ko poshan miltaa rahata he
 When parity is attained, the cover is not confirmed
 aavaran kii kshinta main hi atindriya chetana jaagti he
 All the special persons, such as Lord Mahavira, Mahatma Buddha, Jesus Christ, Mohammed Sahab, etc
, and those who have attained specific knowledge or bodhi, it is only through spiritual practice
 us vishisht sadhana kaa ek mahatvapurn ang he samta
 Parity practice samta kii sadhana kaa arth he -indriya sanyam kii sadhana
 Under this, the matter of dietary restraint is automatically attained
 aahaar kaa sanyam hamaari bhitari shakti ko jagaane main sahaayak hota he
 If diet is necessary for body nutrition, dietary restraint is mandatory to flow the sources of knowledge
 bhojan se mile jamata he or vah itnaa saghan ho jaataa he ki atindriya chetana ke jaagran kii baat dur rah jaati he, indriya chetana bhi ast-vyast ho jaati he
 Our body is a source of psychic knowledge
 kabhi-kabhi achaanak koi ghatana ghatati he or ve strot udghaatit ho jate hai, tab aadmi ko atindriya gyaan kii prapti kaa anubhav hone lag jaataa he
 Cultivation and contingency are both helpful in the attainment of psychic knowledge
 sadhana kii apni visheshta he, kyonki uski ek nishchit prakriya hoti he
 Contingencies are occasional
 aise jaagegi atindriya chetana Conditions to awaken psychic consciousness 1
 bure vichaar na aaen
 2
 Do not get unnecessary thoughts
 3
 vichaar bilkul na aaen
 This is the sequence of development
 yah na samajhen ki aaj dhyaan karne baithe hai or aaj hi vichaar aana band ho jayega
 This is not possible, because we have added countless relationships
 vyakti ghar main baitha he or kaarkaana man main chal rahaa he
 Is sitting in the shop and parivaar peeche chal rahaa he
 You have come alone to the meditation camp, the wife is behind, your mind is entangled in her anxiety
 sambandh jod rakhaa he hajaaron chizon ke saath or vichaar kisi kaa na aae, yah kaise sambhav he
 Relationship and ideas sambandh or vichaar-donon paraspar jude hue hai
 Where there is a relationship, it is mandatory to come to the idea
 yadi dhyaan ke liye aate samay saare sambandhon se mukt hokar aate to sambhav bhi ho saktaa tha, kintu bandha kar aate hai, isliye itnaa jaldi chhot paanaa sambhav nahin he
 Pay attention to this formula - the more sambandh mukti kaa bhav, utana zyada nirvichaar
 You should not try to stop the thoughts, first try to reduce the relationship
 aapane anubandh kar liya-teen baje milanaa he to dhai baje hi aapkaa maansik bhav badal jayega or aap ghadi dekhnaa shuru kar denge
 No more work will be needed again
 agar aadha ghanta kii deree ho jaae to aapaki jhunjhalaahat bad jaaegi
 You should not be under this illusion - all the thoughts and choices of the mind will end in a single day
 aisa kabhi na sochen
 Even with one or two or five-seven days meditation, this will not be possible
 bilkul yathartwaadee hokar chalem, sachai ko samajhakar chalem
 As much as we have expanded our contracts, broadened the relationship, the flow of ideas will not be stopped as long as our inclination towards them is not reduced
 vichaar kii chintaa choden It is expected for the meditator to give up worrying about thoughts, first think of reducing the desire
 yadi vichaar aate hai to ve aapkaa kya bigaadte hai? aap unke saath judate hai, tabhi aapkaa kuch banataa-bigadataa he, anyathaa aapako use kuch bhi laabh-haani nahin hogi
 You get stuck in contracts, get bogged down in ideas, worry about them
 unase prabhavit hote hai, to phir aapkaa nuksaan hona hi he, pareshaani baxi hi he
 We do not have to associate with thoughts, we do not have to flow with ideas
 vichaar aayaa or gaya
 Do not join, just watch
 yadi aisa hua to phir vichaar koi kathinaayee paidaa nahin kar sakegaa
 You become neutral, you become a mediator, you become a vision and a knower, keep watching and observing thoughts, observing them, they will never cause your discomfort and anxiety
 jin logon ko dhyankaal main bahut vichaar aate hai, unhen vichaarpreksha kaa prayog should do
 har shahar ke raste se din-raat kitni Vehicles, vehicles keep on running
 sadak ke kinare kii If the shopkeeper keeps paying attention to them, he will go mad
 vah dhyaan detaa he apane dhandhe par
 He also ignores everything else
 dhyaan ke sadhak ko bhi yahi karnaa he
 If this awareness remains, if the approach is correct then everything will be fine
 hamaare sharir main apaar shakti If there are very bad thoughts in the state of meditation, then meditation cannot be done and if no thought comes, we would have gone into a state of samadhi, there would have been no need for meditation
 isliye hamaari yah dhyaan kii kriya bas thik-thaak he
 This is the middle path
 na ham ati kalpana karen or na niraash hon, keval apni jaagrukta par dhyaan den, use nirantar badhayen
 There is great power in seeing
 ham dekhne kaa abhyaas badhayen
 Seeing means our awareness
 jaise-jaise preksha kii shakti badhegi, vichaar aane bhi kam ho jaaenge
 Where there is no respect, why would anyone come there? If you welcome the idea, add affinity to it, they will try to be your permanent guests
 upeksha karenge to ve swat: chale jaaenge
 As this awareness increases, the problem of thought will continue to be absorbed

 The best thing, whose mind is in rest, the mind is in rest, when such people listen to satsang, when they listen to knowledge, then that knowledge results in them
 tum tote nahin rah jate ho
 Then listening to the story is not an entertainment for you
 yah tumhaare liye parivartan kii kriya ho jaati he
 The truth of what i say right now is that maybe five percent of it reaches inside you, the rest just came and went
 shaktiyon ko karen jaagrath You are unable to apply your knowledge in life
 kaaran, man bada bikharaa hua he
 But this scattered mind can be treated with Yoganidra
 chitt main chaiyn yaa vishram ke saath jab tum prarthana karne lagoge to tumhaari prarthana main bhi bal hoga
 Meaning, your prayer will give you wonderful bliss and wonderful feelings
 agar tum bhakt ho to tumhaari bhakthi main gaharaai aa jaaegi
 If you are a seeker of knowledge, then contemplation of knowledge will be good for you
 ab agar aapkaa praan, sharir swasth or unnat ho to aap ek badi chamatkaarik shakti praapt kar lete hai
 The world has a miracle, not a knowledge
 iske liye kisi chamatkaarik baba ke There is no need to roam back, you practice regular yoga sleep, amazing powers will start to awaken
 ek baat ke liye saavdhaan rahiye ki rajoguni or tamsik vyaktike paas jab shakti aati he to vah apana hi naash kar letaa he
 Therefore, before you come to power, your mind should be sattvic and connected to God
 sach to yah he, jinamein ye cheez nahin he, unki shakti jaagrath bhi nahin hoti
 In which there is concentration and devotion to God and sattvikta, his powers begin to awaken easily
 aap apane andar chhipi hui in rahasyamayi shaktiyon ko jaagrath kariye
 Through such powers, you can rise above mortal life and live like gods
 jab tum swayan rishi ho sakate ho to phir pashu kii bhaanti, ek aam insaan kii bhaanti hansate-rote, krodhi, kaami, lobhi hote hue kyon jien
 There is nothing that is not possible for you to achieve
 sab cheez tum praapt kar sakate ho
 Right now your mind is in how to earn money
 dhan ke pujari, padaarthwaadee, bhogavaadi log kehete hai ki dhan kahaan se aae? dhan bhi kamaaya ja saktaa he
 Keep the mind focused jab tum sanyamit or ekagra chitt ke saath apane vyavsaay ko, apane bijness ko chalaaoge to nishchit rup se tumhen aise formule sujhane lagenge, jinase tumhaara vyapaar din duguni raat chauguni unnati karne lag jayega
 Understand one thing, those who are successful industrialists or successful businessmen, they could succeed because they had a determined and focused mind
 dhairya or santosh ke saath unhone apane kshetra main kaam kiya, isliye safalataa mili
 a person who does not have this power cannot succeed in any field
 dhan chaahate ho dhan kamao
 You want power to get power, but in the end you have to understand that with money you can buy things, with money you cannot buy relaxation of mind
 shakti se aap dusron ko dabaa to sakate hai, par us shakti kaa kya laabh, jisase tum apane andhkaar or apane uddandi man ko dabaa na sako
 Power is the way you make meaningful and creative progress
 gyanpurvak apane jivan ko jien
 Money is not bad, power is not bad, pleasure of matter is not bad, but you should know that there is a limit to it
 ye sab isse adhik tumhen nahin de sakate

 Huh
 ek saamaanya sandarbh kaary hone ke kaaran, vikipedia main kuch aisi saamagree bhi he jise vikipedia ke sampadakon sahit kuch log aakraamak, aapattijanak or ashleel maanate hai
 In 2008, Wikipedia, for example, rejected an online petition against the inclusion of a description of Muhammad in its English version, in keeping with this policy
 vikipedia main raajnneetik rup se samvedansheel saamagree kii upasthiti ke kaaran, pipuls republic of china ne is website ke kuch bhaagon kaa upyog ko pratibandhit kar diya
 The contents of Wikipedia are subject to legislation in Florida, where Wikipedia's servers are hosted, and many editorial policies and guidelines emphasize that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia
 vikipedia main prayek pravishti ek vishay ke bare main honi chahie jo vishwakosh se sambandhit he or is prakaar se shaamil kiye jane ke yogya he
 a subject can be understood to be related to the encyclopedia if it is "notable" in Wikipedia's jargon, that is, if it has acquired significant coverage in secondary reliable sources that are independent of the subject matter
 doosraa, vikipedia ko keval usee gyaan ko pradarshit karnaa he jo pehle se hi sthapit or manyata praapt he
 In other words, for example it should not present new information and original work
 ek daawa jise chunauti di ja sakati he, use vishwasaneey sutron ke sandarbh kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Within the Wikipedia community, it is often touted as "verifiability, not truth", expressing the idea that readers can examine the truth of the content presented in the article themselves and their own interpretation of the subject Make it Finally, Wikipedia does not take a side
 sabhi vichaar or drushtikon, yadi bahari sroton ko nirdisht kar sakate hai, unhen ek lekh ke bheetar kawarez kaa upyukt hissaa milanaa chahie
 Wikipedia editors as a community write and revise those policies and guidelines, and de-emphasize them by deleting them, adding tags, interpreting them, or modifying the article content that it needs Fail to complete yogadanakarta, chaahe ve panjikrut hon yaa nahin, software main uplabdh un suvidhaon kaa laabh uthaa sakate hai, jo vikipedia ko prabal banaati hai
 The "history" page associated with each article keeps a record of each previous repeat of the article, although repeal of the contents of the indictment, criminal intimidation or copyright infringement may be removed later

 Pages of "discussion" related to each article are used to coordinate work among multiple editors

 The open nature of the editing model has remained central to most critics of Wikipedia
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi bhi avasar par, ek lekh kaa pathak yah sunishchit nahin kar saktaa ki jis lekh ko vah pard rahaa he usamen vidhwans pravriti shaamil he yaa nahin
 Critics argue that non-expert editing reduces quality
 kyonki yogadanakarta aam taur par puure dohraan ke bajaay ek pravishti ke chote hisse ko punah likhte hai, ek pravishti main ucch or nimna gunvattta ke avyav paraspar mishrit ho sakate hai
 Historian Roy Rosenjweig said: "overall, writing is the weak foundation of Wikipedia
 samitiyaan kabhi kabhi acha likhti hai or vikipedia kii pravishtiyon kii gunvattta aksar asthir hoti he jo bhinn logon ke dwaara likhe gaye vaakyon yaa prakarnon ke paraspar milane kaa parinaam hoti hai
 "all of this raises questions over Wikipedia's credibility as a source of accurate information
 2008 main, do shodhakartaaon ne siddhant diya ki vikipedia kaa vikaas satat he
 Wikipedia has been accused of exhibiting systematic bias and inconsistency; Critics argue that the lack of appropriate sources for most information and Wikipedia's open nature make it unreliable
 kuch tippaneekaron kaa suzav he ki vikipedia aamtaur par vishwasaneey he, lekin kisi bhi die gaye lekh kii vishwasaneeyata hameshaa spasht nahin hoti he

 Co-founder Jimmy Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any kind are generally not suitable as primary sources and should not be relied upon as authoritative

" vah tippanee dete hai ki non-fiction ke kai paaramparik strot pranaligat purvagrahon se peedit he
 In journal articles new results are reported more than necessary and relevant information is removed from the news report
 haalaanki, ve yah chetavanee bhi dete hai ki internet kii citon par trutiyaan aksar paayi jaati hai or shikshavidon tathaa visheshgyon ko inhen sudhaarney ke liye satark rahanaa chahie, In February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper stated that some professors at Harvard University incorporate Wikipedia into their curriculum, but they differ in their concept of using Wikipedia
 june 2007 main america librari association ke bhootpurv adhyaksh maaikel gormann google ke saath, vikipedia ko nindan kiya, or kaha ki ve shikshavid jo vikipedia ke upyog kaa samarthan karte hai "bauddhik rup se us aahaar visheshgy ke samatuly hai jo sab chizon ke saath big maiks ke nirantar aahaar kii salaah dete hai
 " unhone yah bhi kaha ki "bauddhik rup se niskriy logon kii ek peedi jo internet se aage badhane main asamarth he", use vishvavidhyalayon main utpann kiya ja rahaa he
 He complains that web-based sources are preventing him from learning the more scarce text that is found only in documents or on subscription-only websites
 isi lekh main jenni frai ne vikipedia kii academik shiksha par tippanee di ki: "aap yah nahin kah sakate hai ki bachche bauddhik rup se aalsee hai kyonki ve internet kaa upyog kar rahen hai jabaki duusari ore shikshavid apane anusandhan main search ingine kaa upyog kar rahe hai
 The difference is that whatever they are receiving is official or not and they have more experience of being complicit about it

 " vikipedia samudaay ne vikipedia kii vishwasaneeyata ko sudhaarney kii koshish kii he
 The English-language Wikipedia introduced an evaluation scale that examines the quality of articles; Other versions have also adopted it
 angraji main lagbhag 2500 lekh "fichard artical" ke darje ke ucchtam rank tak pahunchne ke liye maapdandon ke samucchy ko paas kar chuke hai; aise lekh apane vishay main sampoorn or bhalee prakaar se likhaa gaya kawarez uplabdh karaate hai, jinhen kai sahakarmi samiksha prakashnon ke dwaara samarthan praapt he
 German Wikipedia is testing a system of maintaining "static versions" of articles, so that it helps a reader see versions of articles that have gone through specific reviews
 anya bhashaaon ke sanskaran is "dhwajaankit sanshodhan" ke prastaav ko lagu karne ke liye ek sahmati tak nahin pahunche hai
 Another proposal is to use the software to create "trust ratings" for individual Wikipedia contributors and to use these ratings to determine which changes will appear immediately
 vikipedia samudaay ne "a bureaucracy of sorts" kii sthapana kii he, jisamen "ek spasht satta saranchana shaamil he jo swayan sevi prashaskon ko sampadakeey niyantran kaa adhikaar detii he
 Wikipedia's community has also been described as "cult-like", although it has not always been described as such, with completely negative connotations, and criticized it for its failure to accommodate inexperienced users
 She goes

 Apart from the name, administrators do not exercise any privileges in making decisions; Instead they are mostly limited to editing articles that have project-wide effects, and thus do not allow general editors and restrict users to disruptive editing

 Jimmy Wells once argued that only "a community 


 a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers" contributes too much to Wikipedia and so the project "resembles a traditional organization" Wells found in a study More than 50% of edits are done by only 
7% of users, yogadan ke moolyankan kii is vidhi par baad main aaron savaartz ne vivaad uthaaya unhone note kiya ki kai lekh jin par unhone adhyayan kiya, unke avyavon ke ek bade bhaag main upyogkartaaon ne kam sampaadan ke saath yogadan diya tha

 One of the reasons for the triple recovery was the slow installation of the charging system by the operators, especially for prepaid customers and eliminating fraudulent bills that used the SMSC on private handsets to use other operators' SMSC
