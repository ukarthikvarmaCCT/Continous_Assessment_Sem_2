 There are many different philosophies in Hinduism about the role of divine power in controlling the consequences or lack of karma, some still present and some historical
 hindu dharm ke pramukh mat vedant ke anuyaayi aaj bhi astitv main hai, jinka maananaa he ki ishwar, paramatma, apni bhoomika nibhaa rahaa he
 According to Vedanta philosophy, God is basically applying karma, but man is free to choose good or bad
 in ishwarwadi skulon main, karm ko sirf kaaran or prabhaav ke kaanoon ke rup main nahin dekha jaataa, udhaahranswaroop jaisaa ki buddha dharm yaa jain dharm dwaara is vichaar kaa samarthan kiya jaataa he, balki yah paramatma kii ichha par nirbhar he
 Examples of personal God include Shiva in Shaivism or Vishnu in Vaishnavism
 karm ke ishwarwadi vichaar kaa saransh nimnlikhit dwaara vyakt kiya gaya he: "ishwar bina kisi kaaran ke kisiko dukhi nahin karata, na hi bina kisi kaaran ke kisiko khush karata he
 ishwar bahut hi nyaaypurna he or vastutah aap jiske yogya he aapako vahi detaa he
" is prakaar, ishwarwad ke anuyaayi samooh is par jor dete hai ki maanav pidaa kii samasya ke liye karm ek spashtikaran he; koi aatma kisi upyukt sharir main punarjanm leti he, jo karm par nirbhar he or samajhane ke liye yah kaha jaataa he ki aakhir kuch logon ko unke jeevankaal main unke karmon ke fal kyon nahin praapt hue or bina koi paap kiye kuch bacchon kii mrityu aakhir kyon ho jaaya karti he
 Thus, a person gets the fruits of his personal karma and may have to go through many births from plants, animals to humans and the analogy of such fruits of karma is deposited in one bank so that the bank account can be repaid without paying any The person should not be freed from the effects of karma
 hindu dharm ke kuch aarambhik aitihaasik paramparaon main, sankhya sampradaay ke ek naastik anubhag ke anuyaayi sarvopari paramatma kii satta ke mat ko sweekaar nahin karte
 sankhya darshan ke anusaar, kisi paramatma kaa astitv nahin he kintu kam ucch viksit astitv karm ke fal pahunchane main sahaayta karte hai;is prakaar, ve maanate hai ki devataaon yaa atmaaon dwaara kisi tarah kii bhoomika nibhaai jaati he
 These existence can help in bringing happiness in the cosmic world and after birth and death, and can also help in salvation
 hindu dharm kii aarambhik aitihaasik paramparaayen, jaise ki mimasaa aise kisi daivatv ke mat ko asweekaar karti hai or karm ko swatantra rup se kriyasheel dekhati hai, maanati hai ki kaaran-kaary-sambandh ke prakritik niyam karm ke prabhaavon kii vyakhya ke liye paryaapt hai
 According to his views, neither is the supreme God nor does there exist any lesser divine being; Sanskar only produces the fruits of karma; Thus, they believe that karma itself produces results and no god or god or little divinity distributes the results
 in bhinn vichaaron kaa hindu dharm ke bade panth vedant ke ek mahatvapurn granth brahm sutara main kai shrinkhalaaon main spasht rup se ullekh kiya gaya he, jahaan ishwar kii avadharana kaa samarthan kiya gaya he arthath ek nijee sarvocch bhagwaan ko karm ke falon kaa strot mana gaya he, kintu unka khandan karne ke liye tippanee vichaaron kaa virodh karti he
 For example, Swami Sivananda's commentary on episode III
2
38 of the Brahma Sutra mentions the role of God as the fruit distributor of karma
 usee kadi par swami vireshwaranand kii tippanee main kaha gaya he ki is kadi kaa uddeshy vishesh rup se mimasaa ke vichaaron kaa khandan karnaa he, jo kahata he ki ishwar nahin balki karm hi kisi vyakti ke kaaryon ke liye fal detaa he
 According to the Mimamsakas it is useless to covet a god for this purpose, because karma itself can give results in the future
 bhagavad gita kii kuch vyakhyaayein ek madhyavarti vichaar rakhti hai, ki karm kaaran or prabhaav kaa niyam he phir bhi bhagwaan apane bhakton ke liye karm ko halkaa kar saktaa he
 However, in other interpretations of the Bhagavad-gītā episodes, God alone is described as the ultimate functional controller of karma
 ek or vichaar he ki bhagwaan ke hetu kaaryakari koi sadguru apane anuyaayi ke karm ko gata saktaa he yaa sampann kar saktaa he
 Theistic sects of Hinduism like Vedanta disagree with Buddhist thought, Jainism and other Hindu views that karma is merely a law of cause and effect, rather than their view that karma is mediated by the will of a private supreme God
 vedant sampradaay kii ek shakha advait vedant siddhant ko samekit karne vaale ek bhartiya darshanik aadi shankar ne vedantik granth brahm sutara kii ek tippanee main kaha he ki karm kii mul kriyaayein swayan kisi bhavishya main uchit parinaam nahin laa sakati hai; or na hi adrusht - ek adrishy shakti jiskaa kaam or uske parinaam ke bich abhautik sampark hota he - jo khud ke dwaara upyukt kii madhyasthata karti he, jo nyyay sangat rup se sukh or dukh ke yogya hoti he
 According to him, then the task of managing the fruits must be done through a conscious representative, whose name is a supreme being
 maanav ke karm kii kriyaaon ke parinaam gun or dosha main hua karte hai
 Since no inanimate object can move, it needs a medium to operate, and since the law of karma is a non-intelligent and unconscious rule, Shankar argues that there must be a conscious God who is the individual's own Knows about the merits and demerits of the work done and serves as a facilitator in bringing appropriate fruits to the individuals
 is prakaar, bhagwaan vyakti ke vaataavaran ko prabhavit karata he yahaan tak ki iske parmaanuon ko bhi or un atmaaon ke liye jo avatarit hoti he, upyukt punarjanm sharir paidaa karata he or yah sab is kram main ki vyakti ko karm kaa upyukt anubhav ho saktaa he
 Thus, karma must have a theistic administrator or observer, that is, God
 brahm sutara par vedant vichaaron ke sanshleshan kii apni tippanee main ek advait vidwaan swami shivanand ke vichaaron main inhen maton kii punraravritti milti he
 In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutra, Sivananda noted that karma is rooted and fleeting and ceases to exist once a work is executed
 isliye, karm kisiiki yogyata ke anusaar bhavishya main kabhi bhi kaam kaa fal pradaan nahin kar saktaa
 iske alaava, koi yah nahin kah saktaa ki karm apurv yaa punya utpann karata he, jo fal detaa he
 Since Apoorva is unconscious, it cannot do anything unless the existence of an intelligent creature, such as is run by God
 It cannot provide reward or punishment independently
 shwetashwatara upanishad ke swami shivanand ke anuwaad ke ek bhaag main is avadharana kii vyakhya kii gayi he: According to his commentary, the first bird represents the individual's soul, while the second represents the Brahmin or God
 aatma multah brahman kaa ek pratibimb he
 The tree represents the body
 aatma sharir ke saath swayan kaa tadatmya sthapit karti he, uske kaaryon ke fal praapt karti he or punarjanm se guzarati he
 God alone remains an eternal witness, always contented and does not eat, but he is the driver of both the eater and the eaten
 swami shivanand yah bhi ullekh karte hai ki pakshpaat tathaa krurta ke aaropon se bhagwaan swatantra hota he, haalanki saamaajik asamanta, bhagya or duniya main saarvbhaumik ksht ke kaaran us par ye aarope lagaae jate hai
 According to the Brahma Sutra, individual souls are responsible for their own destiny; God is merely a distributor and is a witness to the virtues and demerits of the soul with reference
 brahm sutara ke adhyay 2 par apni tippanee main shivanand aage kehete hai ki karm ke sambandh main bhagwaan kii sthiti ko barish ke saadrishy ke madhyam se samajhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Although rain can be said to be helpful in the development of rice, barley and other grains, the variation in different species is due to the diversity of endotrache hidden in their seeds
 is prakaar, shivanand bataate hai ki alag-alag atmaaon ke vibhinn gun-dosha ke kaaran praaniyon ke virgon ke bich bhinnataayen hua karti hai
 He concludes that it is only by considering the particular actions of beings that God sets the limit for rewards or punishments
 vaishnav dharm ke khand main vedant ke anya maton main karm ke varnan par charchaa kii gayi he
 Thirugnana Sambanthar of Shaivism theory has written about Karma in the 7th century AD in the framework of Shaivism
 unhone hindu dharm main karm kii avadharana kii vyakhya kii he, aisa unhone un buddha dharm or jain dharm se ise alag karte hue kiya he, jinhen bhagwaan jaise kisi bahari astitv kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 According to their belief, just as a calf can find its mother in a herd of cows at the time of drinking milk, similarly karma finds a particular person when it needs to be added and used
 haalanki, aastik hinduon kaa maananaa he ki bachade ke vipareet karm ek naasamajh astitv he
 Therefore, karma cannot find the appropriate person on its own
 Sambanthar concludes that a wise supreme being with full knowledge and power is necessary to associate karma with a suitable person
 is arth main, bhagwaan divine lekhaakaar he
 Appaya Dixit, a Shaiva theologian and proponent of Shiva Advaita, states that only Shiva can dispense happiness and sorrow according to the law of karma
 is prakaar vyakti purv janmon main apni ichchhaaon ke anusaar kiye gayi achche yaa bure karm khud hi kiya karte hai or un karmon ke anusaar, karm ke niyam ko puraa karne ke liye ek nayaa janm hua karata he
 Shaivas believe that there are cycles of births in which the soul continues to attract certain bodies according to karma, which is a mindless object and which depends only on the will of Shiva
 is prakaar, anek log jati vyavastha kii vyakhya karm ke anuroop kiya karte hai, arthath jinhone achche karm kiye unka janm bahut hi aadhyatmik parivaar main hua
 Srikanth, another Shaivite theologian and supporter of Shiva Advaita, believes that different souls themselves do things that can be considered as a reason for doing their particular work or avoiding a particular task, which in their past Is consistent with the success of the work done
 shrikanth kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki jab koi vyakti kisi khaas tareeke se kaary ko karne yaa kisi khaas kaary se parhez rakhane kii ichha karata he, keval tabhi shiv kisiiki sahaayta karte hai
 Regarding the idea that karma produces its effects directly, Srikanth believes that the existence of karma without any intelligence cannot be expected to create many effects through multiple births and multiple bodies; Instead, the fruits of its karma can be met only by the will of God, which governs it in harmony with the will of man, or it is determined by man's own karma in the later stages so that all karma is in proper order by the grace of Lord Shiva
 Be distributed in In this way, God is fundamentally responsible for our deeds on the one hand and is expressed through free will or determination of our actions by God without any prejudice to the moral responsibility of man, on the other hand, the happiness and sorrow corresponding to our deeds God is also responsible for unke vichaar kaa ek acha saransh yah he ki "manushya jimmedaar he, vah apni icchaanusaar kaary karne ke liye swatantra he, jabaki shiv aatma ke karm ke anusaar jaruraton kii purti karte hai
" "according to his karma" all living entities revolve around the whole universe
 unamem se kuch ucchtar grah pranaaliyon main pahunchaa di jaati hai or kuch nimna grah pranaaliyon main ja pahunchati hai
 One of the millions of living entities who are very lucky to get round, gets the opportunity to connect with the real spiritual master by the grace of Krishna
 krishna or aadhyatmik swami donon kii dayaa se, aise vyakti ko bhakthipurna seva kii latikaa kaa beej praapt hota he
 "" Learners, yogis and workers devoid of devotional service are called guilty
 Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu says, the Mayawadi Krishna criminal: Instead of thinking that Krishna is everything, who thinks that everything is Maya is a criminal
 "" Karma refers in a broad sense to any activity, but Often it means activities within the limits of Vedic commandment with the intention of enjoying the result
 Therefore, karma is physical despite being of religious importance
 The worker is interested in prizes like money, pleasure and fame in this life and he also wishes to be promoted to higher planets in the next life
 The major error of karma is that it always results in reactions, which forces the worker to take another physical birth through the process of the soul's demise
 Therefore, whether 'good' or 'bad ", pious or unrighteous, " Vishnu Sahasranama has many names, thousands of names of Vishnu to refer to the power of God in controlling karma
 For example, the 135th name of Vishnu is Dharmadhyaksha, in the interpretation of the Advaita philosopher Shankara, it means "one who sees the virtues and faults of beings directly and makes them attainable
" 32waan naam bhaavana, 44waan naam vidhaataa, 325waan naam apramaatah, 387waan naam sthandah or 609waan naam shribhaavna vishnu ke anya naam jo bhagwaan kii is prakruti kii ore ishaara karte hai
 According to Shankar's interpretation, Bhavana means "one who produces the fruits of the deeds of all beings for pleasure
 The Brahma Sutra states" fruitfully upapatteh "as the act of God as the provider of the fruits of all actions of the living beings
 veydant ke anya up-sampradaay vishishtadvait mat ke ramanuj buraai kii samasya par kehete hue jivan main sabhi buree chizon ke liye jeevon ke bure karm ke sanchay ko jimmevaar tehraate hai or is baat ko kaayam rakhte hai ki bhagwaan amala he, yaa buraai ke daagon ke bina he
 Ramanuja's interpretation of the Brahma Sutra from a Vaishnavite religious point of view will be understood as, in Sri Bhashya, he sees Brahman as Vishnu, which ordains diversity in the conformity of different deeds of different souls
 shribhashya 1
1
1 main ramanuj duhraate hai ki vibhinn atmaaon ke karmon ke falon ke kaaran duniya main asamanthaayen or vividhtaayen hai or apane karmon ke kaaran aatma kii sarvyaapee urja dukh yaa sukh paati he
 The differences between the fruits of karma, that is, good or bad deeds, are due to Vishnu as the supreme enforcer, yet souls are free and responsible for their actions
 iske alaava, ramanuj kaa maananaa he ki vishnu aise logon par krupa karte hai jo unhen khush karne ke liye kaaryshil hone ko puri tarah se kritasankalp hote hai, ve aise logon ke man main bahut hi sadaachari kaary karne kii pravriti paidaa karte hai, aise saadhan jisase unhen praapt kar liya jaay; jabaki duusari taraf, unhen naakhush karne ke kaary karne waalon ko dandit karne ke liye ve unke man main aisi kupravriti paidaa karte hai jo bhagwaan ko praapt karne ke maarg main rukaawat hon
 Madhvacharya, the founder of Dvaita, the other sub-sect of Vedanta, believes that even if karma has no beginning and is accepted as the cause of the problem of evil, there is a root cause of variations in karma
 Want only chunki jeevon ke vibhinn prakaar ke karm hua karte hai, achche se lekar bure tak, aarambh ke samay se un sabhi kii shuruyaat ek prakaar ke hi karm se hua nahin honi chahie
 Thus, Madhvacharya concludes that beings are not the creation of God as Christian doctrine says, but instead beings co-exist with Vishnu, although under his complete control
 In this way, in their original nature and in all their deaths, the souls depend on them
 madhwacharya ke anusaar, bhagwaan, haalanki uskaa niyantran he, lekin vah manushya kii swatantra ichha main hastkshep nahin karata he; haalanki vah sarvashaktimaan he, iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki vah asaadhaaran karnaamon main sanlagn he
 Rather, God enforces the rule of law, conforming to the desires of the creatures, giving them freedom to follow their nature
 is prakaar, bhagwaan ek anumodak ke rup main yaa ek divine lekhaakaar ke rup main kaary karata he or tadnusaar jeev apni sahaj prakruti or apane sanchit karm, achche or bure, ke anusaar kaam karne ke liye swatantra hai
 Since God acts as an approver, the ultimate power for everything comes from God and the creature only uses that power, according to his innate nature
 However, like Shankaraki's interpretation of the Brahma Sutra as noted above, Madhava agrees that rewards and punishments are bestowed by God in accordance with the good and bad deeds performed by him and that he will do justice to his will He does this by keeping himself firm and his actions cannot be controlled by man's deeds, nor is he partiality or favor with anyone The charge may be imposed
 swami tapasyanand tulyata ke saath siddhant kii vyakhya karte hue kehete hai: kisi kaarkaane main urja urjaghar se aati he, kintu vibhinn chakradant usee disha main chalate hai jaisaa ki unhen tay kiya gaya he
 Thus they conclude that God cannot be accused of partiality and cruelty
 Jiva is the doer of his actions and also the consumer of its fruits
 apni shaashvat narkadand avadharana ke kaaran madhav ullekhneey rup se paramparaagat hindu vishwaason se sahamat nahin hai
 For example, they divide souls into three categories: Spirits divided into class three: souls of one category are those who are qualified for liberation, souls of the other category are eligible for continuous rebirth or continual death and the third category
 Souls are ultimately culprits of eternal hell or darkness
 anya koi hindu darshanik yaa hindu dharm ke sampradaay aisi manyata nahin rakhti he
 In contrast, most Hindus believe in universal salvation: that all souls will eventually attain salvation, even if it happens after millions of rebirths
 swaminarayan sampradaay, jiske anek anuyaayi bhartiya rajya gujarat main hai, unke aadhyatmik guru swaminarayan ne kaha he ki hamaare karmon ke falon ke daata ke rup main karm ke prati bhramit nahin hona chahie
 In Vachnamrita, a fundamental scripture of Swaminarayan religion, Swaminarayan states, "just as the seed planted in the ground sprouts upwards after coming in contact with rain water, in the same way, during creation, the organism with its causal body He dwells inside Maya, according to his different deeds, by the will of God, the provider of the fruits of karma, he receives different kinds of bodies
 so, is prakaar, hindu dharm ke anya sampradaayon kii hi tarah swaminarayan sampradaay ke anuyaayi bhi maanate hai ki bhagwaan hamaare karmon ke fal kaa daata he
 However, when he gives the fruits of bad karma, then people may think that God is cruel, whereas this is not the case
 darasal, bhagwaan sabhi ke prati nishpaksh he
 The Brahma Sutra of Veda Vyasa says, "god is not biased in giving pleasure and sorrow to anyone, but he provides the fruits of a person's karma
" However, unlike the general sects of Hinduism, the followers of Swaminarayan consider Swaminarayan as the supreme God, which is not considered by followers of Hinduism
 jagatguru krupaluji maharaj, ek swami, kaa kahana he ki aam taur par karm tay hote hai or manushya apane karmon ke fal praapt karata he; unhone kaha he ki bhagwaan bhi karm ke niyam kaa ulanghan nahin kar saktaa; swami ne do mukhya udaahranon kaa ullekh kiya: pandavon ko behad ksht uthaanaa padaa tha, jabaki ve bhagwaan krishna ke param bhakt the; khud vishnu ne dasharath or kaushalya ke putr ke rup main avatar liya tha, phir bhi dasharath kii mrityu se kaushalya ko vidhwaa hona pada, iske baavjood unhone unke dukh ko samaapt karne ke liye hastkshep nahin kiya
 However, Jagatguru Kripaluji Maharaj also said that the results of a person's karma are dependent on several factors: 1) Prabandha karma, or fixed karma that is experienced in this life; 2) Kriyamana karmas, actions which can be performed in this life, 3) God's will; 4) the deeds of another person present in a particular situation; And 5) coincidence
 But they also say that many things in karma are secrets of creation and man should leave this question to God until he attains God
 ek vaishnav bhakt kulsekhar alvar apane "mukundamala stotra" main kehete hai: 'yad yad bhavyam bhavatu bhagwaan purv-karm-anurupam'
 or purv-karm yaa bhagya yaa daiv hamaare dwaara adrusht he or vidhaataa ke rup main sirf bhagwaan ko hi maaloom he
 God has made the rules of karma and God will not violate it
 haalanki, maange jane par bhagwaan saahas or shakti detaa he
 In chapter 1 of the 10th book of the Bhagavata Purana, Vasudeva preaches Kansa not to kill his wife and Krishna's mother Devaki, saying that death is certain for those who are born and when the body merges into the five elements Is, then the soul leaves the body and becomes helpless and takes other forms according to the law of karma, he mentions the quotation of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, IV: 4: 3
 iske alaava, ve aage kehete hai ki mrityu ke samay vyakti ke man kii sthiti main jo bhi yaad rahaa ho, aatma ek upyukt sharir main bhautik rup dhaaran karti he; arthath, mrityu ke samay aatma or uske man kaa samvedi sharir, buddhi or ahan ek jeev ke garbh main prakshepit hota he, chaahe vah maanav ho yaa a-maanav ho, jo vyakti vishesh kii mrityu ke samay man kii pradhan sthiti ke liye sabase upyukt puraa sharir pradaan kar saktaa ho; dhyaan dene kii baat he ki yah uddhran bhagavad gita, VIII, kadi 6 ke arth ke samaan he
 Such comments were provided by Edwin Bryant, Joint Professor of Religion at Rutgers University, New Jersey
 hindu darshan ke chah roodhiwaadee sampradaayon main ek nyaay sampradaay kahata he ki karm bhagwaan ke astitv kaa ek pramaan he; yah dekha gaya he ki is duniya main kuch log khush hai, kuch ksht main hai
 Some are rich and some are poor
 nyaay ke anuyaayi karm or punarjanm kii avadharana dwaara isaki vyakhya karte hai
 The fruits of a person's actions are not always in reach of the person who is the worker; Therefore it is necessary to have a distributor of the fruits of actions and it is the Supreme Distributor of God
 tadnusaar, nyaay kii yah dharna usee jaisi he jaise ki vedant main he
 In Hinduism, especially theology, karma is an ideal in which "cause and effect are inseparably connected to each other in the moral realm as conceived by science in the physical realm
 One is the reward for good karma and one There is a punishment for bad karma
 If the bad karma is not attained in this life, then the soul starts another existence and while passing in that new environment in the former One has to bear the fruits of the karma done
 Thus it is important to understand that karma does not go anywhere, one has to enjoy the happiness or sorrow of the result of the deeds done in the past
 According to and according to his faith he will be so; The person who does commendable deeds will be admirable and the person who commits bad deeds will be a sinner
 He becomes pure by pure deeds and evil by bad deeds
 And here they say that a person is made up of desires
 The intention will be as it is desired; And karma will happen as intended
 And that will be the way you do karma ”
 Apart from the ancient and above mentioned writers, the principle of karma is mentioned in Gautama Dharma-sutra, Shatapatha Brahmana, Kathak-griha-sutra, Chandojna Upanishad, Markandeya Purana and many more
 karm ke bare main likhe shastron main karm ke sambhavit parinaamon par kuch vistaar se varnan kiya gaya he
 When it comes to rebirth and the life of the past, there is often talk about coming back as a kind of object
 is maamle main, yah sach he, yaa phir kam se kam granthon kaa aisa kahana he
 The narrator-griha-sutra states, "some enter the womb of man to attain a contained existence; others go into abiotic material according to their deeds and according to their knowledge"
 paap ke sambandh main karm ke parinaamon par adhik bade paimaane par charchaa kii gayi he
 "karmavipak means the ripening of bad deeds or sins
 As stated in Yogasutra II
 3, this enjoyment has three forms, that is, caste, age: and enjoyment
 nimna praani main janm or rogon or viklaangata kii lambii suchi hai, jinhen paapiyon ko bhogana padataa he
 kuch lekhakon ne vishisht paapon ke liye vishesh shakha vistaar prastaavit kiya he
 udhaaharan ke liye, "harithsamhita main kaha gaya he ki brahman kaa hatyara safed kusht rog or gaay kaa hatyara kaale kusht rog se peedit hota he

" The Karmavipak further states, "that no soul is without hope provided it is ready to wait and to suffer for its evil deeds, that it does not need to be intimidated by the many existences foreshadowed in those actions and That the soul in its long journey and gradual development will finally be able to recognize its true greatness and understand eternal peace and perfection

 The story of Ajamil in the Bhagavata Purana also explains this point
 ajamil apane jivan main chori karnaa, apni patni or bacchon ko chhod dena or ek veshya se vivaah karne jaise bahut saare bure kaamon main lipt rahaa tha
 But at the time of death he reluctantly chanted Narayana's name and that's why he got salvation or union with God and was saved by Yama's messenger
 vastav main ajamil apane sabase chote bete, jiskaa naam bhi narayan tha, ke bare main soch rahaa tha
 But the name of God has a powerful effect and Ajamil was forgiven for his great sins and attained salvation despite bad deeds
 shwetashwatara upanishad 7 or 12 daawa karte hai ki karmon kaa karta idhar-udhar bhatakta he or apane karmon ke anusaar punarjanm praapt karata he, na ki anugrah ke siddhant se sarvashaktimaan srashta arthath ishwar se prarthana karata he
 God is a great refuge of all and when one is blessed by God or the will of God, a person attains immortality
 ishwar kii krupa se koi vyakti du:khon se mukt ho saktaa he
 Therefore, the Shvetashvatara Upanishad unquestionably assumes a supreme being, by whose grace the devotees find a way to get rid of the law of karma
 jaisaa ki aadi shankaracharya ne shwetashwatara upanishad VI:4 par apni tikaa main likhaa he, "agar ham apane sabhi karm ishwar ko samarpit kar dete hai to ham karm kaa kanoon ke adheen nahin honge
" Theology changed as a means of reducing sin, some of which are difficult to solve with the principle of karma
 udhaaharan ke liye, inamen se ek pratha he shraadh yaa jaisaa ki brahm puraana main kaha gaya he, "uchit samay, uchit jagah par or supaatr dwaara nirdhaarit prakriya ke anusaar shraddha main brahman ko jo kuch bhi diya jaataa he, vah pitaron ke labharth ke nimitt hota he", iskaa arth purvajon kaa sammaan he, haalanki iske vipareet karm main aasthaa rakhanevaala isse sahamat hoga ki jab deh kii mrityu hoti he, aatma swat: ek anya deh main pravesh kar jaati he, bhale hi koi apane purvarjon kaa shraadh karata he yaa karti he, isse koi antar nahin padataa he
 Therefore, contrary to karma, Kane states that in the Shraddha "the principle of requesting a body of rice to three ancestors is that even after 50 or 100 years have passed, the souls of the three ancestors passed through the wave of the wind into their heavenly body
" Are able to enjoy the taste or aroma of the rice mass
 " Certainly, if we accept the description given in the scriptures, which states that karma should not be taken literally, then two different opinions can be reconciled
 haalanki, is vishay par likhit vibhinn maton dwaara pramanit, karm par bhinn vichaaron ke bich sangati kahin or nahin paae jaaenge
 Followers of theism believe in the cycles of creation, where the soul is attracted to a particular body on the basis of karma by relying only on the will of God as an immaterial object
 udhaaharan ke liye, kaushitki upanishad 1
2 kahata he ki krimi, keede-makode, machhlee, pankshi, singh, suar, saanp yaa maanav jaise jivan kaa vibhinn avasthaa main janm lenaa vyakti dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon or gyaan dwaara nirdhaarit hota he
 The Chandojna Upanishad 5
10
7 explains the difference between a good birth, such as a birth in a spiritual family, that is, or a bad birth, such as a dog or pig
 is prakaar, vibhinn tarah ke jivan kyon dikhaai padate hai, vibhinn prajatiyon ke ped-paudhon se lekar alag-alag tarah ke pashuon jaise jaivik vikaas ke alag-alag staron ke vishaal kshetra kaa charitra-chithran karne ke liye karm kaa siddhant aata he or maanav jaise ek hi tarah kii prajati ke vibhinn sadasyon ke antar ko bhi yah spasht karata he
 Thus, many such Upanishads state that birth takes place in a particular caste on the basis of karma, it is said that those who have done good deeds are born in a pious family, which is synonymous with the Brahmin caste
 achche karmon karanevaalon kaa janm dharmaparayan parivaar main hota hai, jahaan uske bhavishya kii niyati vartmaan jivan main uske aacharan or kiye gaye kaaryon dwaara nirdhaarit hoga
 In the Gita, Krishna said that the characteristics of a Brahmin are determined by his conduct and not by birth
 a verse from the Gita explains this element: "O Parantap! The deeds of Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas and Shudras are distinguished by virtues arising from nature
" gita main isi mat kii aage or bhi jis tarah charchaa kii gayi he, madhavacharya varna kii avadharana kii vyakhya karte hue kehete hai ki yah shabd hindu samaaj main gun or karm ke aadhaar par chaar saamaajik shreniyon main vibhaajan ko nirdisht karata he, ise janm dwaara nahin, balki aatm kii prakruti dwaara paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 For example, a soul having the nature of a Brahmin can be born as a Shudra and vice versa
 unke anusaar, jati vyavastha janm dwaara tay hoti he, vastav main jati shabd samudaay vishesh ke liye nirdisht he; na ki varna ke liye
 Varna defines the state of the soul as a whole, for example, a soul classified as Brahmin tends towards erudition; The Kshatriya soul tends towards the system and the Shudra soul tends to serve
 is prakaar, unhone jati vyavastha kii nai vyakhya di, jaisaa ki unka maananaa he ki kisi vyakti kii jati uske swabhaav se sambandhit he, na ki uske janm se; madhav ke anusaar janm varna dwaara nirdhaarit nahin hota he; dharmaparayan prabud chandal ek agyani brahman se kahin adhik shreshth he

 The effect of karma done in the previous life or due to them has to suffer and it has to reside in another body in the next life, in addition to the limited meaning of karma, it is often used in the broader sense of action and reaction
 is prakaar, hindu dharm main karm kaa arth koi gatividhi, koi kaam karnaa yaa bhautikwaadi kaary karnaa ho saktaa he
 It often has a special meaning with specific combinations such as karma yoga or karma-kanda meaning "yoga or action" or "functioning of materialistic activity" respectively

 This gender difference in height for adults is due to the rapid and slow completion of the growth spurt, which results from delayed growth and lower levels of estradiol in males
 maadaaon ke vikaas ko prabhavit karne vaala hormone ek androgen he jise estrodeol kaha jaataa he
 While estradiol promotes uterine and breast growth, it is also a key hormone in accelerating fertility and maturation and termination of epiphyseal

 Like girls, another effect of androgens can increase the secretion of oil from the skin, which can cause different amounts of acne
 muhaanson se aasaani se roka yaa khatm nahin kiya ja saktaa, lekin yuvavastha ke ant main ye aam taur par puri tarah khatm ho jate hai
 Although it is not uncommon for a full-grown adult to suffer from acne frequently, it is generally less severe than acne in adolescents

 In most young women, this mound dissolves in the outline of the mature breast, although there are so many variations in the shape and size of adult breasts that they cannot always be distinguished separately in stages 4 and 5
 guptang ke bal aamtaur par yuvavastha kaa doosraa dhyaan dene yogya parivartan he, jo stan vikaas ke aksar ek kuch maheene ke bheetar shuru hota he
 This change is known as pubarche

 It mixes with plastic in food and fluids, and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a significantly higher level of BPA was found in more than 90 percent of the US population during the study
 aisa anumaan he ki shishuon or bacchon dwaara ucchtam maatra main BPA grahan kiya jaataa he
 BPA is found in many plastic bottles and BPA is more likely to spread as the temperature rises, that is, when a baby boils or keeps food in the microwave
 poshan kaarak yuvavastha ke samay ko prabhavit karne vaale sabase majboot or spasht paryaavarniya kaarak hai
 Girls are particularly sensitive to nutrition regulation, as they must receive complete nutrition for fetal development
 atirikt calories se sharir main vasa kii maatra bad jaati he, jisase mastishk ko yah sanket miltaa heki yuvavastha tathaa prajnan prakriyaaon kii shuruyaat ke liye sansaadhan uplabdh hai
 Much of the evidence suggests that for the last few centuries, nutrition differences are the main reason for variation at the time of puberty, even among most populations and social classes in the same population
 duniya bhar main badhati pashu protein kii khapat, poshan main anya parivartan or bachapan main badhata motopa samay se pehle yuvavastha aarambh hone kaa mukhya kaaran he, vishesh rup se un aabaadiyon main jinamein pichhali umr zyada rahi he
 In many populations the amount of nutrition types is shrinking
 haalanki uplabdh aahaar urja kaa yuvavastha ke samay par sabase mahatvapurn prabhaav padataa he, isamen aahaar kii gunvattta kii bhi ek bhoomika hoti he
 Low-protein and high-fiber diets, as in certain vegetarian diets, are associated with the late onset and slow development of women's puberty
 vaigyanik shodhakartaaon ne shuruuaati motaape ko ladakiyon main yuvavastha kii jaldi shuruyaat ke saath joda he
 She has cited breast development before nine years and menarche before twelve years as obesity
 ladakiyon main yuvavastha kii jald shuruyaat swasthya samasyaon kii jad kahi ja sakati he
 Average levels of daily physical activity have also been seen to affect the timing of puberty, especially in women
 vyaayaam kaa ek ucch str, chaahe athlettic yaa sharir kii chhavi ke liye kiya jaae, yaa phir dainik jivan nirvaah ke liye, prajnan ke liye uplabdh urja calories kam kar detaa he or yuvavastha ko dhimaa kar detaa he
 The effect of exercise is often increased by reduced weight and cholesterol
 puraane rog ladakon or ladakiyon donon kii yuvavastha main deree kar sakate hai
 Those who have permanent illnesses or lack of nutrition are the most affected
 pashchimi duniya main, antra rog kii sujan or tapedic pichhali sadi main lambe samay tak prabhaav ke liye kukhyat rahe, jabaki duniya ke aviksit kshetron main dirghakaalik paraseete sankraman vyapak rup se failaa hua he
 Mental illnesses appear in puberty
 hormonon ke vikaas ke kaaran mastishk kaa vishesh vikaas hota he jiske kaaran manodasha se sambandhit vikaar jaise pramukh avsaadagrastata vikaar, bipoalr vikaar, disthemia or chizophrenia jaise vikaar ho sakate hai
 In girls aged 15 and 19, 40% of cases are due to diet related disorders
 yuvavastha ke samay par kuch sabase kam samajhe gayi paryaavarniya prabhaavon main saamaajik or manovaigyanik prabhaav shaamil hai
 Compared to the effects of genetics, nutrition and general health, the social effects are small, which can change the changes of puberty from a few months to years
 in saamaajik prabhaavon kii karypranali agyaat he, haalanki bataaya jaataa he ki shaareerik prakriyaaon ke kai prakaar, jinamein pheromone bhi shaamil he, jaanwaron par kiye gayi shodh par aadhaarit he
 The most important part of a child's psychosocial environment is the family, and most social impact research has examined family structure and its relationship with early or late onset of female puberty
 zyaadaatar adhyayan bataate hai ki ucch tanaav vaale gharon main un ladakiyon main minarche kii avasthaa pehle ho sakati he, jinke pita unke shuruuaati bachapan main anupasthit the, yaa jinke ghar main sautela pita tha, yaa jinka bachapan main lambe samay tak yon shoshan hota rahaa he, yaa jinhen vikasshil deshon se kam umr main god liya gaya he
 Conversely, menarche may appear late in girls who grow up in a large family with a biological father
 paryaavarniya tanaav kii asahneeya seemaa, jaise yuddh ke samay sharnaarthi kii sthiti, jisamen shaareerik suraksha ko khatra ho, ko paripakvata main deree se judaa paaya gaya he, ek aisa prabhaav jo aahaar kii aparyaaptta se jatil ho saktaa he
 Most of these so-called social influences are minor and not fully understood by us
 adhikansh "prabhaav" aankadon ke rup main hai jo mahamari ke dauraan hue surveykshanon se pataa chale hai
 Statistical associations are not necessarily facts and a wide variety of transformations and alternative explanations can be imagined
 kisi bhi chote bachche par itani choti maatra main padane vaale prabhaav kii pushti yaa khandan karnaa kabhi bhi sambhav nahin he
 Furthermore, the interpretation of data is politically disputed as this type of research can be used for political advocacy
 raajnneetik agenda ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav ke aarope kabhi kabhi vaigyanik aalochana ke saath lagate rahe hai
 Another drawback of social research is that almost all of them are related to girls, some because female puberty requires greater physical resources and some because it involves a unique phenomenon that allows women survey research to be associated with men
 Makes it easier
 adhik jaankaree minarche lekh main di gayi he
 The sequence of events of pubertal development can sometimes vary
 udhaaharan ke liye, 15% ladke or ladakiyon main, pubarche, gonadarche or thelarche se kramshah kuch maheene pehle ho saktaa he
 Rarely, menarche occurs in some of the girls before other signs of puberty appear
 ye parivartan chikitsa moolyankanon ke laayak he kyonki inase kabhi kabhi ek rog kaa sanket miltaa he
 In a general sense, the culmination of puberty is reproductive maturity
 nishkarsh ko paribhaashit karne ke liye maandand, prajnan kshamta kii prapti, adhiktam vayask kii oonchai kii prapti, jananaangon kaa adhiktam aakaar yaa vayask sex hormone kaa str jaise vibhinn kaarnon ke liye alag ho sakate hai
 On average, a girl attains the maximum adult height at an average age of 15 years and a boy at an average age of 18 years
 sambhavit prajnan kshamta, ladakiyon main saamanytah 1-2 saal tathaa ladakon main vikaas ke 3-4 saal puure hone se pehle aati he
 Stage 5 typically represents maximal development of the genitals and adult hormone levels
 kai anya shaareerik pranaaliyon kii pratikriyaaon or viniman ke saath, endosirin prajnan pranali hypothelemus, pituitary, jananaang tathaa adrenal grathiyon se mil kar banati he
 Real puberty is called "central puberty" because it begins due to the process of the central nervous system
 hormonal yuvavastha kaa ek saral vivaran is prakaar he: The onset of this neurohormonal process may occur 1–2 years before the first direct physiological change
 hypothelemus kaa arcuat nabhik prajnan pranali kaa sanchaalak he
 It contains neurons that generate the senses of gnrh in the portal venous system of the pituitary gland
 arcuat nabhik ko mastishk ke anya hisson kii tantrikaon kii pratikriyaaon or yonang, adepos utakon or vibhinn prakaar kii anya pranaaliyon se praapt hormonon dwaara prabhavit or niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 The pituitary gland processes the pulsed gnrh in the normal flow of blood, leaving LH and FSH in a pulsed pattern
 jananaang, testosterone evam estrogen steroid sex hormone utpann kar ke alech va enne ke badhate str ke prati pratikriya karte hai
 The adrenal glands are another source of steroid hormones
 adrenal paripakvata, jise adrenarche kaha jaataa he, aam taur par bachapan ke madhya main gonadarche se pehle hoti he
 The endocrine reproductive system becomes functional by the end of the first trimester of fetal life
 janm ke samay vrushan or andashay kuch samay tak niskriy rahete hai kintu janm ke kai maheenon baad hormonal gatividhi phir se shuru karte hai, jab mastishk kaa na samajha ja sakane vaala tantra arcuat nabhik kii prakriya ko roktaa he
 This has been referred to as the maturity of the pre-pubertal "gonadostat", which becomes susceptible to negative feedback by sex steroids
 janm ke kai maheenon baad kii hormonal gatividhiyon kii avadhi ke baad, rokane kii prakriya shuru hoti he jo shishu kii langikta ke anuroop ho sakati he, jiske baad vilambtaa charan shuru hota he, jise sigmund frid ne varnit kiya he
 Gonadotrophin and sex steroid levels fall below about 8 to 10 years of childhood
 There is increasing evidence that the reproductive system is not completely dysfunctional during childhood years
 There is a slight increase in gonadotrophin senses, and future eggs in the ovarian sac surrounding germ cells double in number
 arcuat nabhik main pulse janarator ke nishedh ke saath hi hypothelemus main saamaanya yuvavastha kii prakriya armbh hoti he
 This inhibition of the arcuate nucleus is an active inhibition released by other areas of the brain
 signal or tantra jo nishedh se arcuat nabhik ko chhodte hai, dashakon se jaanch kaa vishay hai or puri tarah se samajhe nahin ja sake hai
 Leptin levels increase throughout childhood and allow the arcuate nucleus to process
 agar bachapan main arcuat nabhik kaa vikaas mastishk main chot ke kaaran samay se pehle baadhit ho jaae, to yah gonodotrophin indriyon ko sanchalit kar saktaa he jisase umr se pehle yuvavastha kii prakriya aarambh ho jaayegi
 Neurons of the arcuate nucleus secrete gonadotropin-releasing hormone) into the blood of the pituitary portal system
 ek america physiologist, ernest nobil ne paaya ki hypothelemus se jienarech sanket lagbhag 1-2 ghante ke antaraal par nabz ko alech ) ke srav ke liye prerit karte hai
 LH veins are caused by gnrh secretion caused by the rupture of the arcuate nucleus, which itself, is caused by the shivering of signals or signal generators of the central brain system

 By the end of puberty, there is little difference in the intensity and frequency of gonadotrophin senses during the day and night
 kuch jaanchakartaaon ne yuvavastha kii shuruyaat ke liye mastishk main kanpakanpi kii pratidhwani ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 Accordingly, this statement represents the senses of the genitals bursting into the night shortly before puberty
 "swatah teevr hone vaali prakriyaaon" kaa samooh hypothelemus, piyush granthi or jananaangon main kishoravastha ke liye uttaradaayi hormonon kii maatra ko badha detaa he
 Regulation of the adrenarche and its relation to the maturation of hypothalamic genitals is not yet fully understood and according to some evidence it is a large independent process parallel to or beyond puberty
 adrenal androgen ke badhate str kii 6 va 11 varsh ke bich, yahaan tak ki hypothelemic yuvavastha kii jananaang nason kii vruddhi se pehle bhi, pahchaan kii ja sakati he
 Adrenal androgens are responsible for genital hair, adult body odor and other androgenic changes in both sexes
 adrenarche or gonadarche ke bich antar kaa praathmik chikitsiya mahatv yah he ki inke dwaara guptang ke baalo or sharir kii gandh jaise parivartan yah pramanit nahin karte ki koi baccha yuvastha ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 The early stages of hypothalamic maturation in males seem to be very similar to the early stages of female puberty, although they occur 1–2 years later
 alech vrushan kii ledig koshikaon ko testosterone banane ke liye uttejit karte hai or rakt ke str main vruddhi shuru ho jaati he
 For most of puberty, nighttime levels of testosterone are higher than daytime levels
 maadaaon kii yuvavastha kii tulana main naron ko janan shiraaon main vruddhi kii aavriti kii niyamitata or tivrata kii kam aavashyaktaa hoti he
 However, in adolescent boys, a significant portion of testosterone is converted to estradiol
 estrodeol vikaas main oochaal, haddi kii paripakvata or ladakiyon kii tarah ladakon main apifizal ko band karne ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Estradiol also induces the development of breast tissue in a large proportion in boys
 ladakon main yuvavastha ke dauraan jab halke ginacomestia yaa suje hue stnagron kii samasya ho jaati he to unhen bataaya jaataa he ki kuch purush kishoron main estrodeol ke ucch str kaaran ye prabhaav asthai hote hai
 Male hormonal changes in most young men occur during adolescence
 naron ke jivan ke is bindu par, testosterone ke str main dhire dhire vruddhi hoti he or adhikansh prabhaav androgen receptaron ke madhyam se diahydrotestosterone ke niojit angon main badlaav ke rup main sanchalit hote hai
 As the LH pulse increases, the theca cells of the vagina begin to produce testosterone and a small amount of progesterone
 zyaadaatar testosterone aasapaas kii koshikaon main samaa jaataa he jinhen granulosa koshikaayen kehete hai
 a small increase in FSH increases the aromatase activities responsible for the growth of these granulosa cells, which convert most testosterone into estradiol for secretion into the veins
 estrodeol kaa badhata str maadaa yuvavastha main estrogen visheshtaon se sambandhit shaareerik badlaav laata he: teevr vikaas, haddiyon kii paripakvata main vruddhi yaa roak, stanon kaa vikaas, vasa kii badi hui sanrachana, garbhashay kaa vikaas, jhilli or yoni kii twachaa kii motaai kaa badhanaa, tathaa nichali shroni kii chaudaai badhanaa
 As estradiol levels rise slowly and other naturally occurring processes develop, the stage of adulthood is attained as soon as the hypothalamic "gonadostat" is reported to be functional
 sakaaratmak pratikriya kii yah uplabdhi mahila yon paripakvata kii parichaayak he, kyonki yah andotsarg ke liye madhya chakra alech aavesh kii anumati detaa he
 Adrenal androgens and testosterone levels also increase during puberty, producing specific androgenic changes in female puberty: pubic hair, other androgenic hairs as noted above, body odor, pimples
 yuvavastha kii puri avasthaa ke dauraan hormone ke str main lagaataar vruddhi jari rahati he
 IGF1 levels increase and then decrease at the end of puberty

 In between all these works, he also recites small devotions, praising Allah

 Then the second rakaat reads like this and sits on knees on the sijda

 In addition to this, he raises his hand from Allah and asks for prayers and thus completes the two rakat prayers, most of the prayers are recited by two rakats and sometimes four rakats are also recited
 padhane kii chaal kam adhik yahi he
 The Quran forms a statement in one of its verses: i imaan waalon sabar or namaajon se kaam lo Clearly, Allah has the honor for the ease of offering prayers
