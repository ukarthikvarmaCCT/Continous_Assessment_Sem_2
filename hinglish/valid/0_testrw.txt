 The term "organization development" is often used interchangeably with organizational efficacy, especially when it is being used as the name of one of the departments within an organization
 Organization development is a progressive field, reactive to many new ideologies, including positive adult development

 iskaa swaroop antainushasik hota he or yah samajashasre, manovigyaan or prerana, abhyaas or vyaktitv ke siddhanton ko viksit karata he
 Although neither the sponsoring organization nor the change factors can be sure from the beginning of the exact nature of the problem or problems being resolved, nor can it be sure that the change factors will require assistance
 But it is necessary to reach an experimental agreement on these issues

 An internal change factor is usually someone from a group of employees who has expertise in behavioral science and intermediate technology in OD
 Backhard has cited a number of cases, according to which people have been trained in OD and have been successful in returning to their organizations and completing change tasks
 sanghathan main parivartan kriyavidhi ke swaabhaavik vikaas main, yah ek adarsh vyavastha vaali vidhi prathit hogi

 The change factor can be an employee or line member of the organization who has studied OD theory and technology
 In such a situation, a "contractual relationship" is an internal agreement, which should probably be explicit in terms of all other conditions involved, except for the fee
 OD kaarykram kii pahal kisi aise sanghathan dwaara kii jaati he, jisamen koi samasya ho

 This is a direct example of the use of psychotherapy: the consumer or patient must play an active role in seeking help in finding solutions to their problems
 This informs the consumer's willingness to accept assistance at the organization level and assures the organization that management is actively concerned
 OD kii ek mukhya visheshta, jo ise adhikansh anya sudharatmak kaaryakramon se alag karti he, vah yah he ki yah ek "sahaytapurna sambandh" par aadhaarit he
 Some people believe that there is no physician to treat the diseases of the transforming factor; He does not test the 'patient', does not diagnose any disease and does not write any prescription
 Nor does he attempt to teach any new store of knowledge to the members of the organization, which they later transfer to the work position
 The main function of change factor is to define the organization's problems by using principles and methods derived from behavioral regimes such as industrial / institutional psychology, industrial sociology, dialogue, cultural anthropology, administrative theory, organizational behavior, economics and political science
 And provide assistance in solving

 There is also a focus on groups because the relevant behavior of individuals in organizations and groups is usually a result of collective influence rather than personality
 apni aantarik or bahya kaaryaatmakataa or sambandhon ki sanbhaalane kii sanghathan kii kshamta ko sudhaarna OD kaa uddeshy he
 This includes enhanced interactions between individuals and groups, more effective dialogue, improved organization's ability to cope with all types of problems, more effective decision processes, more appropriate leadership style, advanced skills in dealing with destructive disputes, and organization members
 Includes such things as high levels of mutual trust and cooperation, etc
 ye uddeshy manushya ke swabhaav ke ek ashaavadi drushtikon par aadhaarit ek mulya-tantra se nikalate hai, jiske anusaar- ek samarthak vaataavaran main vyakti vikaas or uplabdhi ke ucchtar staron ko praapt kar paane main sakasham hota he
 Scientific methods - exploration, thorough investigation of causes, experimental testing of estimates and review of results - are necessary for the development and efficacy of the organization
 upabhokta sanghathan ko upkarnon, vyavhaaron, drushtikonon kaa ek samucchy or apane swayan ke swasthya kii nigaraanee karne or apane swayan ke punarnavinikaran or vikaas kii ore sudharatmak kadam badhaane ke liye ek kaaryayojna pradaan karke "unhen swayan apana kaary karne dena" OD peshewaron kaa antim lakshya hota he
 This is consistent with the system concept of using feedback as a regulatory and corrective mechanism

 This work was the predecessor of research, which is an important element of OD, which will be discussed later
 Levine then became involved in the establishment of laboratory training or T-groups, and after his death in 1947, his close assistants helped develop survey-research methods at the University of Michigan
 These methods became an important part of the OD as national training laboratories and a growing number of universities and private advisory institutions across the country continued to develop the sector
 apane praarambhik aashwaasano kii purti kar paane main of-site prayogshaala prashikshan kii vifaltaa OD ke vikaas ko protsaahit karanevaali mahatvapurn shaktiyon main se ek thi
 Laboratory training is the process of learning through a person's "here and now" experience as a member of a working training group
 saamanytah aise samooh kisi nirdhaarit kaarykram ke bina milte hai
 Their purpose is to teach members about themselves through spontaneous "here and now" reactions to an ambiguous imaginary situation
 aise samoohon main netritv, sanrachana, avasthaa, samvaad or swa-seva vyavhaar kii samasyaayein vishisht rup se utpann hoti hai
 Members have an opportunity to learn and hear about themselves, observe others, and act as effective members of the group
 jaisaa ki pehle paalan kiya jaataa tha, prayogshaala prashikshan "ajanabi samoohon" main yaa vibhinn sanghathanon, paristhitiyon or prishthbhumiyon se aane vaale vyaktiyon se milakar bane samoohon ke bich kiya jaataa tha
 However a major problem arose in transferring this knowledge gained from these "stranger laboratories" to actual situations "on returning home"
 This required a transfer between two different cultures, a relatively safe and defensive environment of the T-group, and the transaction of an organizational environment with its traditional values
 isane is prakaar ke prashikshan ke praarambhik pravartakon ko ise "parivaar samoohon"- arthath ek hi sanghathan ke bheetar sthit samoohon- par lagu karne hetu prerit kiya
 The concept of organization development emerged when changes in the location of the training site and the realization that culture was an important factor affecting members of a group
 aitihaasik udhaahrancambridge clinics ne paaya ki unhen apane aantarik kaary sambandhon main samasya utpann ho rahi he
 Concerned about the potential impact of these problems in the care of the patients, the medical director contacted an organizational consultant of a local university and asked for help
 An initial dialogue between the directors, the clinic administrator and the consultant appeared to be informing the problems in leadership, dispute resolution and decision processes
 The consultant suggested that data should be collected so that a working treatment could be created
 Clinic officials accepted this and the experimentally working agreement was concluded
 salaahkaar ne saakshatkaaron kii ek shrinkhalaa yojit kii, jisamen clinics ke karmchaaree-dal ke sabhi sadsy, chikitsa nideshak or prashaasak shaamil the
 The advisor then "summarized" or summarized the interview data to identify specific problem areas
 lagbhag ek saptaah baad ek kaaryshaala ke prarambh main, salaahkaar ne clinics ke karmchaaree-dal ko punah vah data diya, jo usne sangrahit kiya tha
 Employees organized the problems into the following priorities chikitsa karmchaaree-dal ke vishisht sadasyon ke bich bhoomikaaon ke takaraavon ke kaaran nirmit ho rahe tanaav marijon kii dekharekh main sahyog karne kii aavashyaktaa ke bich vyavdhaan utpann kar rahe the
 The leadership style of the medical director resulted in the cancellation of his decisions on important work related issues
 This sometimes led to inactivity and confusion at the level of medical and administrative staff
 prashaasak, chikitsa or bahya karmchaariyon main aapasi samasyaon se bachane kii pravriti thi
 Open disputes about policies and laws were thus curbed, but repressed feelings were clearly having a negative impact on interpersonal and intra-group behavior
 bhoomika vishleshan or salaahkaar dwaara sujhai gai anya takneekon ke prayog dwaara clinics ke karmchaaree or chikitsa nideshak bhoomika takaraav or netritv samasyaon ko ujagar karne or unase nipatane ke prabhavi tareeqon kii yojana bana paane main sakasham ho gaye
 Programs designed to enhance communication skills and a workshop session to deal with conflicts resulted in greater openness and confidence in the entire clinic
 is pehali kaaryshaala kaa ek mahatvapurn parinaam ek kaaryayojna ke nirmaan ke rup main mila, jisane parinamit kaal ke dauraan clinics karmchaariyon dwaara clinics samasyaon par lagu kiye jane vaale vishisht charnon kaa maarg prashast kiya
 The consultant agreed to oversee these efforts and provide assistance as much as possible
 Additional discussions and team development sessions were held with the director and medical and administrative staff
 pehali kaaryshaala ke lagbhag do maah baad yojit duusari kaaryshaala main clinics ke sabhi karmchaaree upasthit rahe
 duusari kaaryshaala main, clinics ke karmchaariyon ne takaraav or antarvaiyaktik samvaad se nipatane se judi samasyaon par ek saath kaary karnaa jari rakhaa
 baithak ke antim ardh-diwas ke dauraan karmchaariyon ne clinics ke kaaryshil sambandhon main sudhaar karne ke liye aagaamee saptahon or maheenon main kii jane vaali sudhaar gatividhiyon ko sammilit karne vaali ek sanshodhit kaaryayojna viksit kii
 a notable additional benefit of this OD program was that clinic staff learned to observe the performance of the clinic as an organization and to deal with some of its other problems
 Six months later, when the consultant conducted a continuity check of the organization, employees confirmed that interpersonal problems were now under better control and that some of the techniques learned in the two workshops associated with the OD program were still in use

 is kshetra ke "pun:avishkaar" kii aavashyaktaa ek aisa vishay ban gai he, jis par iske kuch "sansthaapak janak" gambhirthapurvak charchaa kar rahe hai
 Along with this demand for re-innovation and change, scholars have begun to study organizational development from a sentiment-based perspective
 udaahranarth, diclerk ne is bare main likhaa he ki kis prakaar bhaavnaatmak aghat pradarshan ko nakaaratmak rup se prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Many employees experience feelings of aggression, restlessness, apprehension, pessimism and fear due to downsizing, outsourcing, mergers, reconstruction, continuous changes, invasion of privacy, harassment, and abuse of power, which can result in their performance deterioration
 
 diclerk kaa suzav he ki aghat kaa upachaar karne or pradarshan main sudhaar laane ke liye, OD peshewaron ko aghat ke astitv ko sweekaar karnaa chahie, karmchaariyon ko apni bhaawanaaon par charchaa karne ke liye ek surakshit sthaan pradaan karnaa chaiye, aghat ko chihnit karnaa chaiye or use drushtikon main rakhana chaiye or iske baad bhaavnaatmak pratikriyaayein vyakt karne or unase nipatane kii anumati deni chaiye
 ise praapt karne kii ek vidhi yah he ki karmchaariyon ko is baat ko chitrit karne diya jaae ki ve paristhiti ke bare main kya sochate hai or uske baad unhen apane chitranon ko ek-duusare ko samajhane diya jaae
 chitra bananaa laabhadaayak hota he kyonki yah karmchaariyon ko un bhaawanaaon ko vyakt karne kii anumati detaa he, jinhen saamanytah ve shabdon main vyakt nahin kar sakenge
 saath hi, chitra aksar gatividhi main sakriy sahabhaagita kii maang karte hai kyonki prayek vyakti ko chitra banane or phir uske arth ke bare main charchaa karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Wendell L
 French and Cecil Bell define organization development as "organization improvement through action research"
 yadi OD ke antahsth darshan ko sankshepit karne vaale kisi ek vichaar kaa ullekh karnaa ho, to vah court levin dwaara kalpit tathaa anya vyavaaharaatmak vaigyanikon dwaara vistaarit kaarywahi anusandhan kaa vichaar hoga
 saamaajik parivartanon or adhik vishisht rup se prabhavi, sthaayee parivartan ke prati chintit levin kaa vishwaas tha ki parivartan ke prati prerana tathaa kaarywahi ke bich ek majboot sambandh tha: yadi log unhen prabhavit karanevaale nirnyon main sakriy hai, to unke dwaara nai vidhiyon ko apana liye jane kii adhik sambhaavna hoti he
 He stated that "rational social management proceeds in a cycle of stages, each of which consists of a circle of fact-finding about planning, action and outcome of action"
 is prakriya ke bare main levin ke varnan main teen charan shaamil hai: "deleting control": a person or group facing a dilemma or confusion realizes that change is needed
 "parivartan": samasya kaa nidaan kiya jaataa he or vyavhaar ke nae modelon kii khoj va pareekshan kiya jaataa he
 "re-control": The implementation of a new behavior is evaluated and adopted if it is making the ideas more powerful
 chitra 1 kaarywahi anusandhan ke madhyam se niojit parivartan main sammilit charnon or prakriyaaon ko sankshep main vyakt karata he
 Action research is expressed as a cyclical process of change
 yah chakra ek saath kaary kar rahe upabhokta or parivartan kaarak dwaara shuru kii gai niyojan kaarywahiyon kii ek shrinkhalaa ke saath shuru hota he
 The key elements of this phase include a primary diagnosis, data collection, results feedback and joint action plan
 pranali siddhant kii bhashaa main, yah input charan he, jisamen upabhokta pranali abhi tak na pahachaani gai samasyaon ke bare main jaagruk hote hai, is baat ko mahasoos karte hai ki prabhavi parivartanon ke liye bahari sahaayta kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he or samasya nidaan kii prakriya ko salaahkaar ke saath saajha karte hai
 The second phase of action research is the action or conversion phase
 is charan main shikshan prakriyaaon se sambandhit kaarywahiyaan or upabhokta sanghathan main vyavhaaraatmak parivartanon kaa niyojan or kriyanvayan shaamil hota he
 As shown in Figure 1, feedback in this phase will extend through a feedback loop a and will be effective in changing previous planning, so that the learning activities of the consumer system are better matched to the objectives of the change
 
 This phase involves action-planning activities carried out jointly by the advisor and members of the consumer system
 karyashala yaa shikshan satron ke baad, ye kaarywahi charan roopantaran charan ke ek bhaag ke rup main kaary ke dauraan purna kiye jate hai
 The third stage of action research is the output or outcome phase
 duusare charan ke baad kriyanvit kiye gayi sudharatmak kaarywahi charnon ke kaaran vyavhaar hone vaale vaastavik parivartan is charan main shaamil kiye jate hai
 Again data is collected from the consumer system, so that progress can be determined and necessary adjustments can be made in the learning activities
 Such small adjustments in learning activities can be made through feedback loop B
 Major adjustments and reevaluations for basic changes in the program bring the OD project back to the first or planning stage
 chitra 1 main pradarshit kaarywahi-anusandhan model levin ke niyojan, kaarywahi or parinaam maapan ke punraritiya chakra kaa dridhtaapurvak paalan karata he
 It also shows other aspects of Lewin's general model of change
 jaisaa ki chitra main suchit kiya gaya he, niyojan charan niyantran hataane yaa samasya jaagrukta kaa charan hota he
 The action phase is the phase of change, that is, to try to use new forms and behaviors as an attempt to understand and deal with system problems
 
 The outcome phase is a period of reengineering, in which new behaviors are studied during the task and if successful and effective, it becomes part of the treasure trove of the problem-solving behavior of the system
 kaarywahi anusandhan samasya kendrit, upabhokta kendrit or kaarywahi unmukh hota he
 This includes a diagnosis, proactive learning, problem-finding and problem-solving process in the consumer system
 data keval ek likhit report ke rup main saralata se nahin lautaaya jaataa, balki khule satron main lautaaya jaataa he or upabhokta tathaa parivartan kaarak vishisht samasyaon kii pahchaan karne or unhen shreneebaddh karne main, unke vaastavik kaarnon ko dhundne main or unase vaastavik rup se evam praayogic rup se nipatane ke liye yojanaayen viksit karne main ek saath milakar kaary karte hai
 Yet scientific methods such as data collection, formulation of estimates, testing of estimates and measurement of results, though not as intensively as in the laboratory, are not an integrated part of this process
 kaarywahi anusandhan aatm-vishleshan or aatm-punarnavinikaran ke liye praayogic va upyogi upkarnon ke saath system ko chhodte hue upabhokta system kii prabhavakaarita ke rakh-rakhaav or vruddhi ke liye ek lambii-shrenee vaali, chakree, swa-sudharatmak kriyavidhi ko bhi sakriy rup se nirdhaarit karata he
 "interventions" are the main learning processes in the "action" phase of organization development
 hastkshep sanrachit gatividhiyaan hoti hai, jinka prayog ekal rup se yaa upabhokta pranali ke sadasyon ke saath sangyojan main kiya jaataa he, taaki unke saamaajik athwa kaary pradarshan main vruddhi kii ja sake
 unhen ek parivartan kaarak ke dwaara ek sudhaar kaarykram ke ek bhaag ke rup main prastut kiya ja saktaa he yaa unka prayog upabhokta dwaara sanghathan ke swasthya kii avasthaa kii jaanch karne yaa apane swayan ke vyavhaar main aavashyak parivartanon ko lagu karne ke liye banaae gaye kaarykram ke baad kiya ja saktaa he
 "structured activities" means such diverse methods as experimental exercises, questionnaires, attitude surveys, interviews, relevant group discussions and even during meal time meetings between the change factor and the member of the consumer organization
 Each action that affects an organization's improvement program in a change-factor-consumer system relationship can be called an intervention
 anek sambhavit hastkshep ranneetiyaan hai, jinamein se chayan kiya ja saktaa he
 During the selection of a specific strategy, many assumptions are made about the nature and functioning of organizations
 bechhard ne aise chah anumaanon ko soochibaddh kiya he: Interventions range from interventions designed to increase the effectiveness of individuals to interventions designed to deal with teams and groups, intergroup relations, and overall organization
 kuch hastkshep aise hote hai, jo kaary se jude muddon par kendrit hote hai or kuch aise hote hai, jo prakriya se jude muddon par kendrit hote hai
 Finally, interventions can be broadly classified based on which change mechanism they value: for example, feedback, awareness of cultural rules of change, interaction and dialogue, confrontation and training by the practice of new knowledge or skills
 
 upabhokta pranali main shikshan or parivartan ke liye ek surakshit vaataavaran ke nirmaan main sahaayta karnaa un sarvaadhik kathin kaaryon main se ek he, jinka saamana parivartan kaarak ko karnaa padataa he
 In a favorable environment, human training is built on its own and continues continuously throughout a person's lifetime
 jab yah chakra nae staron kii ore badhata jaataa he, to nae vyavhaar se nai duvidhaayen or samasyaayein utpann hoti hai
 In contrast, in an unfavorable environment, training is much less certain and in a psychological panic environment it often stops altogether
 sanghathan main puraani paddatiyon kaa niyantran hataane kaa virodh kiya ja saktaa he kyonki is vaataavaran main karmchaaree yah mahasoos karte hai ki apni vaastavik bhaawanaaon ko vyakt karnaa anupyukt he, haalanki aise prakatikaran srujanaatmak ho sakate hai
 Therefore, necessary feedback is not available in a hostile environment
 Also, trying to use new methods can be considered risky because it violates established rules
 is tarah kaa koi sanghathan apni pranaaliyon ke niyamon ke kaaran bhi bandhaa hua ho saktaa he: yadi ek bhaag parivartit hota he, to anya bhaag bhi isamen sammilit ho jaaenge
 isaliye yathasthiti banaae rakhana hi adhik saral hota he
 Hierarchical authority, specialization, expansion of control and other features of formal mechanisms also discourage experimentation
 parivartan kaarak ko anivaary rup se swayan in sabhi khataron or avarodhon par dhyaan dena chaiye: kuch aisi baaten, jo uske liye sahaayak ho sakati hai, ve nimnlikhit hai: Team building, training, large group interventions, mentoring, performance review, size reduction, TQM and leadership development are some examples of interventions

 gandalf kaa shaq sahi niklaa
 At the same time Sauron came to know from Gollum that the ring was in the Poet
 souron ne turant nau bhayanak nazgul shaayar ko ravaanaa kiye
 On the other hand, Gandalf gave Frodo and his friend Sam Gamzy the responsibility of taking the ring out of the shire and taking it to Revendale, where the king of one of the Gandharva community lived, Alrond
 raste main frodo or sam ko unke rishtedaar meriadock brandybak or peregrin tuk bhi unke saath ho liye
 Gandalf did not meet them in the nearby city, as he had promised
 par vahaan frodo ko bache-khuche numenoriyon kaa sardaar aragorn zarur mila, jisane unki kaafii madad kii
 On the way to Rivendale, the Nazguls attack Frodo on the Weathertop Hill, and upon not giving the ring, Nazrul Sardar Angmar's dynasty injures Frodo with a poisonous magical talwar
 ek anya gandharv kii madad se frodo revendel pahunchaa jahaan uskaa ilaaj hua
 On the other hand, Gandalf went to the Tower of Orthanc in Isengaard to seek advice from the sorcerer's chief Saruman the White about the ring
 uske apane bholepan main saruman ko sab sach sach bataa diya
 But Saruman's heart was filled with satanism and greed
 usne gandai ko minar ke upar kaid kar liya or daityon kii ek apni sena banane laga -- uruk haai, jinpar din ke ujaale kaa kuprabhav nahin padataa
 Gendaf escaped from the Orthank and reached Rivendale
 revendel main elrond ne ek parishad aahut kiya, jisamen madhya dharti kii sabhi azaad naslon ke pratinidhi shaamil the
 Upon Frodo's debut there, it was decided that Frodo would become the ring bearer and that s would go to Mordor and throw him in the mountain of doom in Lawe's hull, causing the ring and Sauron to be destroyed
 in sab ke liye anguthi kii maitri banaayi gayi, jinamein the : frodo, sam, meri, pippin, gandai, aragorn, boromir, legolas or gimli 
 Maitri tried to pass through the pass of the Karadras mountain peak towards Mordor, but the conscious Karadras did not give way to them
 maitri ke paas or koi raah na hote hue usko rasta badalakar moriya kii khadaan se guzarana padaa
 There, a black firefighter fell into the depths of Gandalf Khan while fighting the disease
 vahaan se ye maitri gayi gandharvon ke ek duusare shahar main : lothalorian, jahaan frodo ne gandharvarani galadriyal ke aaine main apane kathin bhavishya kii kuch jhalken dekhin
 After this, these people went to the border of Gondor through boats in Mahanadi Anduin
 vahaan saruman ke uruk-haayiyon se unka ek bhayanak yuddh hua jisamen boromir maaraa gaya
 Frodo himself decided that now he can take this ring to Mordor and he will have to walk this path alone
 lekin sam kii mannath par frodo or sam dono hi mordor kii ore nikal pade

 vishwanath pratap singh 
 Vishwanath Pratap Singh was the eighth Prime Minister of India
 rajeev gandhi sarkaar ke patan ke kaaran pradhanmantri bane vishwanath pratap singh ne aam chunaav ke madhyam se 2 disambar 1989 ko yah pad praapt kiya tha
 Singh as Prime Minister is known for his efforts to reform India's backward castes

 He was the son of Raja Bahadur Rai Gopal Singh
 unka vivaah 25 june 1955 ko apane janm din par hi sita kumari ke saath sampann hua tha
 He received two sons and jewels
 unhone elahabaad main gopal intermediat college kii sthapana kii thi
 Vishwanath Pratap Singh studied at the Universities of Allahabad and Poona
 vah 1947-1948 main udai pratap college, varanasi kii vidhyaarthee union ke adhyaksh rahe
 Vishwanath Pratap Singh was also the Vice President of the Student Union of Allahabad University
 1957 main unhone bhudaan aandolan main sakriy bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Singh donated his land
 iske liye paariwarik vivaad hua, jo ki nyaayalay bhi ja pahunchaa tha
 He was also a member of the Executive Cell of All India Congress Committee, Allahabad
 vishwanath pratap singh ko apane vidhyaarthee jivan main hi raajnneeti se dilchaspee ho gai thi
 He was from an affluent family, so he got success in youth politics
 unka sambandh bhartiya congress party ke saath ho gaya
 He reached the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly in 1969–1971
 unhone uttar pradesh main mukhyamantri kaa kaarybhaar bhi sambhaala
 His Chief Ministership lasted from 9 June 1980 to 28 June 1982
 iske pashchaatt vah 29 janvari 1983 ko kendriya vaanijya mantri bane
 Vishwanath Pratap Singh was also a member of the Rajya Sabha
 31 disambar 1984 ko vah bharat ke vittamantri bhi bane
 In the Indian political scene, Vishwanath Pratap Singh was the finance minister when he had a confrontation with Rajiv Gandhi
 vishwanath pratap singh ke paas yah soochna thi ki kai bharatiyon dwaara videshi bainkon main akut dhan jamaa karavaaya gaya he
 On this, VP Singh ie Vishwanath Pratap Singh appointed a spy organization of America, Fairfax so that such Indians could be traced
 isi bich sweden ne 16 april 1987 ko yah samachar prasaarit kiya ki bharat ke boforce company kii 410 topon kaa sauda hua tha, usamen 60 karod kii raashi kamishan ke taur par di gai thi
 When this news reached the Indian media, it started presenting it daily by making it headstrong
 is 'braking news' kaa upyog vipaksh ne bhi koob kiya
 He sent a message to the public that in the Rs 60 crore brokerage, Rajiv Gandhi's government was running away from the investigation
 rajeev gandhi ko bhartiya nyaayalay ne clin chit bhi pradaan kar di
 The 1989 elections also came in the limelight for the Bofors scandal
 ve
 pi
 singh or vipaksh ne ise chunavi mudde ke rup main pesh kiya
 Although preliminary investigation has proved that no allegations have been made against Rajiv Gandhi by the Auditor General, the Auditor General had undoubtedly raised the credibility of the cannons
 bhartiya janata ke madhya yah baat spasht ho gai ki bofars topein vishwasaniyan nahin hai to saude main dallali lee gai hogi
 In such a situation, the target was to be made by Rajiv Gandhi and his government
 idhar ve
 pi
 singh ne 1987 main congress dwaara nishkasit kiye jane par vibhishana kii bhoomika nibhaane kaa man bana liya tha
 But this Vibhishan wanted Rama's defeat, not Ravana's
 ve
 pi
 singh ne janata ke madhya jaakar yah dushprachaar karnaa armbh kar diya ki congress sarkaar main sheersh str par bhrashtachar vyaapt he
 This is why bureaucracy and bureaucracy have become corrupt
 ucch str par bhrashtachar ke daawey ne bharat ke sabhi virgon ko chaunkaa diya
 VP Singh's words sounded to him like the true word of Satyavadi Harishchandra
 ve
 pi
 singh ne chunaav kii tithi ghoshit hone ke baad jansabhaon main daawa kiya ki boforce topon kii dallali kii raqam 'lotus' naamak videshi bank main jamaa karai he or vah satta main aane ke baad puure prakaran kaa kulasa kar denge
 The accuser, who was the surveyor of the Ministry of Finance and Defense in the Congress, was making this accusation, due to this the proletariat accepted that there must be truth in the claims of VP Singh
 ab yahan yah kehane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he ki ve
 pi
 singh dwaara rajeev gandhi ke prati dushprachaar kaa uddeshy satta tak pahunchnaa hi tha
 In this election truth and honesty were sacrificed and lies misled people
 yahi manovigyaan bhi he ki yadi koi jhooth baar-baar aapke kaanon main padataa he to ek din aap use sach maane lete hai
 The same thing happened in the case of the Bofors deal
 bhartiya janata ne ise sach maan liya
 Thus, in this election VP Singh's image became that of a politician whose honesty and devotion could not be doubted
 uttar pradesh ke yuvaaon ne to unhen apana nayak maan liya tha
 VP Singh lived side by side with the students
 vah motorcycle par chunaav prachaar karte chaatro ke saath ho lete the
 He also avoided car rides as much as possible to represent himself as an ordinary person
 falswaroop iskaa sarthak prabhaav dekhne ko praapt hua
 On the one hand VP Singh created the image of his truthful Harishchandra among the public and on the other hand he started the work of breaking the Congress
 jo log rajeev gandhi se asantusht the, unase ve
 pi
 singh ne sampark karnaa armbh kar diya
 He wanted the dissident Congress to break away from Rajiv Gandhi and the Congress Party
 unki is muhim main pehla naam tha-aarif mohammad kaa
 Arif Muhammad was a man of free and progressive views
 is kaaran vah chaahate the ki islamic kuritiyon ko samaapt kiya janaa aavashyak he
 Arif Muhammad and Rajiv Gandhi were very close to each other but an incident created a gap between them
 darasal hua yah ki hyderabad main shahbaano ko uske pati dwaara talaaq dene ke baad maamla adaalat tak ja pahunchaa
 The court considered the Muslim woman Shahbano eligible for subsistence allowance
 lekin muslim kattarpanthi chaahate the ki 'muslim personal lau' ke aadhaar par hi faisla kiya jaae
 For this reason, this dispute had caught a lot of momentum
 aisi sthiti main rajeev gandhi ne aarif mohammad se kaha ki vah ek zordaar abhiyaan chalaakar logon ko samajhaayen ki muslimon ko nayaa kaanoon maananaa chahie or 'muslim vyaktigat kaanoon' par nirbhar nahin rahanaa chahie
 VP Singh along with Vidyacharan Shukla, Ramdhan and Satpal Malik and other disgruntled Congressmen formed their own separate front on 2 October 1987
 is morche main bhartiya janata party bhi sammilit ho gai
 The Left parties also announced their support to the front
 is prakaar saat dalon ke morche kaa nirmaan 6 agast 1988 ko hua or 11 oktober 1988 ko rashtriya morcha kaa vidhivat gathan kar liya gaya
 1989 Lok Sabha Elections complete
 congress ko baari kshati uthaani padi
 It got only 197 seats
 vishwanath pratap singh ke rashtriya morche ko 146 siten milin
 The BJP and the Left parties expressed their intention to support the National Front
 tab bhaajapa ke paas 86 saansad the or vamadalon ke paas 52 saansad
 Thus the National Front got the support of 248 members
 ve
 pi
 singh swayan ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar bataa rahe the
 He felt that the defeat of Rajiv Gandhi and the Congress was possible only because of him
 lekin chandrasekhar or devilal bhi pradhanmantri pad kii daud main shariq ho gaye
 In such a situation, it was decided that VP Singh would be crowned as Prime Minister and Chaudhary Devi Lal would be made the Deputy Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri banate hi unhone sikhon ke ghaav par maraham rakhane ke liye swarna mandir kii ore daud lagaai
 Personally, Vishwanath Pratap Singh was very clean-hearted and his image as Prime Minister was of a strong and social political visionary
 unhone mandal kamishan kii siforeeshon ko maanakar desh main vanchit samudaayon kii satta main hissedari par mohar laga di
 VP Singh died at the age of 77 on 27 November 2008 at Apollo Hospital in Delhi

 There was a legal battle over Terry's life-death for seven years

 lekin terry ke mata-pita apni beti ko jivit rakhana chaahate the

 Some cases related to euthanasia demand in India •terry shiyaavo ke maamle par bahes kii pratidhwani bharat main sunai dene lagi he
 Here also some cases have come up where the patient's relatives or the patient himself expressed his wish for death
 In 2005, Tarkeshwar Sinha, a resident of Bihar Patna, petitioned the Governor to grant mercy death to his wife Kanchanadevi, who has been unconscious since 2000
 •bahucharchit vyankatesh kaa prakaran adhik purana nahin he
 The 25-year-old Hyderabadi had expressed his wish to donate all his organs before his death

 Similarly, mercy death, which may be motivated by human emotion and is to be done to alleviate the unbearable suffering of the victim, is also considered a crime of culpable homicide under Section 304 of Indian Penal Code
 •jeene kaa adhikaar he to marane kaa kyon nahin? The constitutionality of Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code in the case of P
 Rathinam v
 Union of India was objected on the ground that this section is an infringement of Article 21 of the Constitution
 yani jeene kaa adhikaar he to marane kaa bhi adhikaar hona chahie

 gruhasthi main rahete hue hamen apane ko ishwar ke maarg par lagaana he, grihasth apane saare vyaavhaarik kaaryon ko karata hua prabhu kii upasna kar saktaa he or ishwar praapt kar saktaa he
 You used to say that you do the work of the world for 23 hours, but give one hour to God and then forget the world for that long
 aap kehete the usase milo jisane ishwar dekha he, vahi tumhen ishwar kaa darshan kara saktaa he
 Your practice is primarily a combination of karma, worship and knowledge
 isko apnaane se jigyaasu thode hi samay main drushtaa bhav main pratishthit ho jaataa he jo gita kaa asli prayogtmak swarup he
 That is why it is also called the visual means
 kisi bhi mat kaa upaask is sadhana ko kar saktaa he tathaa isamen kisi bhi dharm, jaati or desh kaa bandhan nahin he
 Today, millions of curious brothers and sisters are adopting it and taking spiritual benefits
 ham log aise sant kii chaaya main yah samaj hi nahin paye ki kya andhkaar phir kabhi aa saktaa he? kya yah anand kabhi ham se alag bhi ho saktaa he or aise mahapurush kaa kabhi vichoh bhi ho saktaa he? parantu yah samay aa hi gaya jisane hamen unke prakaash kaa purna gyaan karaayaa
 Because there is no sense of light only when there is no sun
 ham unke prakaash ke chakachaundh main unako nahin pahchaan paye
 Therefore, you voluntarily separated yourself without suffering anything

 maukey ki samaj rakhte hue, ek bear cartil jo ki kalakatta ke stock brokaron kaa samooh tha ne reliance ke sheyaron ki khudara bikri shuru kar di
 To prevent this, a group of stock brokers, until recently referred to as "friends of Reliance", started buying short-selling shares of Reliance Industries from the Bombay Stock Exchange
