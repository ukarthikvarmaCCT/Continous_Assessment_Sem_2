 Lindelof and Cuse said that deciding the 2010 series finale date was "extremely liberating" and helped rediscover the center of the series
 lindelopha ne kaha, "ham ab or nahin roak rahe hai

 shrinkhalaa ke rachanaakaar in tatwon ko shrinkhalaa kii puranic kathaon ko rachane ke liye prayog karte he or yah prashansako kii atakalon kaa aadhaar banate he
 Among the mythological elements of this program is a "monster" that roams the island; a mysterious faction known as Survivor "others", an organization called the Religion Initiative, which maintains many research bases on the island, a number sequence that frequently appears in characters' pasts, present and future, and personal relationships or The synchronization between characters of which they are often unaware

 Some of the public fanfare has been discussed and rejected by the creators of the public theory program, with the most common being that the survivor of Oceanic Flight 815 is dead or in hell
 yah je je abramas dwaara vishesh rup se nakaar diya gaya tha
 In addition, Lindelof has ruled out speculation that the spacecraft or the inhabitants of another planet affect the events of the island or whether everything is happening in a person's imagination
 carlton kus ne is siddhant ko bhi kaarij kar diya jiske anusaar yah dweep par ek reality tivi kaarykram he or kalakaar bekhbar sangi hai
 And Lindelof has also refuted the theory that the 'monster' is a robot as in Michael Crickton's novel Pre
 ' tathaapi, yah dhyaan dena zaruri he ki pehle ke asweekrut siddhant, vishesh rup se samaykaal se sambandhit, asweekaar hone se shrinkhalaa main sammilit hone main badal gaye isi prakaar ho saktaa he ki anya asweekrut siddhant bhi naatak main sammilit ho jaye

 His 'principles of Economics' was taught in England as a textbook of economics for many years
 isamen maang or aapurti, marginal utility tathaa utpaadan laagat ko vyavasthit rup diya
 Marshall is counted among the major founders of economics
 arthshaastra ko ek swatantra bauddhik anushaasan ke rup main sthapit karne kaa shrey alfred marshall ko jaataa he
 Before 1885 economics was a part of the curriculum of philosophy and history as a subject
 itihaaskaar or darshanik apni degree lene kii majaburi main adhyayan the
 Marshall not only gave it an independent institutional basis, but raised its scientific standards to physics and biological levels
 1903 main marshall kii koshishon ko us samay kamyaabi mili jab cambridge vishvavidhyalay main arthshaastra ke alag adhyayan or degree kii shuruyaat hui
 Soon other academic institutions around the world accepted economics as a separate discipline

 Marshall pioneered 'diagrammatic Economics' by translating economic assumptions into simple graphs
 marshall kii kubi yah thi ki unhone apni dharanaon kii in graphiya abhivyaktiyon ko aarthik vishleshan kaa ang banane main safalataa hasil kii
 He tried to make economic science practical so that with his help government officials, politicians and businessmen can take important decisions
 1890 main prakashit apni vikhyath rachana principles of iconomics main alfred marshall ne maang or aapurti kaa vistrut vishleshan karke nioclasical paddati kaa dhaanchaa taiyaar kiya
 In this sense, he can also be called the founder of Neoclassical Economics

 darshan kii sabhi clasiki rachanaayen padhane ke baavjood unhone arthshaastra main maharath hasil karne kaa faisalaa kiya
 It is said that after seeing the poor condition of poor settlements, he felt that by becoming an economist, he would be able to think better on the problem of poverty
 marshall ne bazaaron ke ek duusare par padane vaale prabhaav ko nazarandaaj karte hue unka alag-alag adhyayan kiya or 'partial equilibirium analisis' kaa pratipaadan kiya
 He showed that when prices increase, firms bring more commodities to the market
 unhone ise 'aapurti kaa niyam' kii sangya di
 When prices fall, consumers buy large quantities of goods
 yah marshall kii nigaah main maang kaa niyam tha
 This scissor of demand and supply determines not only the price of each item through its qatar-byot, but also the quantity produced
 jevans ke maang-chaalit ravaiye or ricardo ke aapurti-chaalit ravaiye ke vipareet marshall ne jor diya ki maang or aapurti donon mil kar keemton or utpaadan kaa nirdhaaran karte hai
 He believed that market competition would shift real prices towards equilibrium
 agar daam santulanavastha se upar honge to utpaadak apana maal nahin bech paayegaa or chizein uske godaam main jamaa hone lagengi
 Then he will get the message that he has to drop the price
 agar keemten santulanavastha se neeche rakhi gayin to chizein itani zyaada bikengi ki godaam khaali ho jaayenge or kami pad jaaegi
 Traders will accept this as a message to increase prices
 marshall ne mana ki maang or aapurti kii yah kanchi ek pechida sthapana he
 Therefore, they also analyzed its two flakes separately
 unhone dekha ki maang kisi khaas vastu kii upyogita or uske upbhog se milane vaale santosh se tay hoti he
 The consumer is constantly in search of utmost utility
 agar kisi jins ke daam unche honge to vah upyogita kii talash main duusari jinson kii taraf chalaa jayega
 He defined changes in demand as the purchase of more or less of a single item by consumers at the same price
 demand karv agar badalata he to uskaa kaaran kai anya parivartanon main talasha ja saktaa he : samruddhi ke str main badlaav, aabaadi main parivartan, logon kii abhiruchiyon main tabdili, anya vastuon ke daamon main utaar-chadhaav yaa bhavishya kii keemton ke bare main badali hui pratyaashaayen
 In this sense, greater prosperity and increased population demand will increase and prices will go up
 bhavishya main daam badhane kaa andeshaa bhi maang badha saktaa he
 Marshall explained the effect of supplementation on the demand for something by increasing the prices of other things
 masalan, agar gasolin ke daam badhate hai to usase judi hui chizon kii maang bhi gir jaaegi
 Marshall showed how supply depends on the cost of production
 upabhokta agar upyogita or santosh kii talash main he to utpaadak munaafe ko adhiktam karne ke fer main rahata he
 If the law of decreasing returns of scale is applied and the prices of components and labor are increasing, then the cost of production also increases
 zaahir he ki agar vyapaariyon ko behatar daam nahin milenge to ve adhik vastuon kaa utpaadan karne ke liye taiyaar nahin honge
 Secondly, no matter how much production is going on, if in such a situation, the producers will have to increase the prices
 lekin agar praudyogiki behatar ho jaati he or prati ikai shram kam karch karnaa padataa he to aapurti bhi badhegi or daam bhi kam honge
 Most economic relationships are tied to work-causes
 marshall ne is silsile main elasticity yaa loch kii dharna viksit kii
 If the effect of a cause or event is very large, then that relation will be considered elastic and if it is less then inelastic
 marshall ne lochaneeyata naapane kaa ek ganitiya farmula bhi pesh kiya
 He believed that if a commodity is not an option and the consumer cannot use it in place of another, then that commodity will be inelastic in terms of prices
 daam badhane par bhi uski bikri kam nahin hogi
 Marshall also showed how elasticity of demand depends on prices
 namak ke packet kii keemat kaafii kam hoti he, isliye agar uske daamon main bada parivartan ho jaae to bhi namak upabhoktaaon ko namak ke daam itane zyaada nahin lagenge ki uski maang par asar pade
 But if there is an increase in car prices or college fees, then consumers will start facing problems
 marshall ne maang kii elasticity tay karne main samay kii bhoomika par bhi dhyaan diya
 The demand which is not elastic today means that even if the price is not decreasing, it may be elastic tomorrow
 jaise, petrol manhagaa hone par bhi kaaren kam bikni shuru nahin hui
 But with less fuel more cars made, people started car-pooling
 isse petrol kii maang par fark padaa
 Interestingly, this scholar who separated economics from ethics and history, had a great interest in the distribution of income and the problem of poverty
 unhone shram-bazaar kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jisamen vyapaaree upabhokta hota he, maang karata he or samaaj va parivaar aapurti karata he
 Marshall observed that if wages increase, the supply of unskilled laborers increases, but the demand for unskilled labor steadily falls as technology improves
 isse akushal mazdoor kam tankhwaah praapt hone ke kaaran garibi main rahane ke liye abhishpt hai
 The special thing is that despite reaching this conclusion, Marshall neither recommended raising the minimum wage nor made any suggestion to reduce poverty
 unhone keval itnaa suzav diya ki akushal mazaduron ko apane parivaar kaa aakaar simit rakhana chahie
 Marshall mostly contributes to the microeconomic variety, but has also made some macroeconomic contributions
 krayshakti samta ek aisa hi siddhant he jiske tahat do deshon ke bich mudra kii vinimay dar bazaar ke dharaatal par tay hoti he
 For example, if a burger sold in the US for one dollar and in Japan for one hundred yen, then the purchasing power of one dollar and 100 yen in the market was equal, even if one dollar in the currency market is considered equal to ten yen
 marshall dwaara kiye gayi bazaaron ke adhyayan kii pehali aalochana to yah kii jaati he ki unhone ek bazaar ke ek-duusare par padane vaale asar ko nazarandaaz kiya, isliye ve keval aanshik santulanavastha ke siddhanth tak pahunch paye
 While Leon Walrus studied the interrelationships of the markets and was able to formulate the principle of general equilibrium
 marshall dwaara kiye gayi garibi ke kaarnon ke adhyayan ko bhi aalochanatmak drushti se dekha jaataa he, kyonki ve akushal shramikon kii nunatam mazaduri badhaane kii koi sifaarish nahin karte
 He is praised for giving an independent institutional foundation to economics, but it is also said that the result of the separation of economic science from philosophy, ethics and social concerns is progressively a 'wretched science' in Thomas Carlyle's language

 hyderabad ke atirikt, iske vikaas kendra bharat ke is nagaron main bhi hai - bangalore, chennai, pune, mumbai, nagpur, dilli, kolkata, bhubaneshwar or vishakhapattanam
 In late 2008, this company came to light when the owners of this company were caught in the crime of manipulating accounts and the company became notorious
 kabhi america companiyon ke liye chunauti prastut karne vaali iti company satyam aaj puri duniya ke liye khalanaayak ban chuki he
 It has changed the hopes of crores of people
 ek america vishvavidhyalay se prabandhan main snaatak kii degree lene vaale ramling raju ne america kushal karmiyon kii neend haraam kar di thi
 He took over his work and took that work to Indian personnel and became a role model for Vision-2020
 aam bhartiya ko mote vetan or arampasand jivan kaa sapana dikhaaya
 Those who got jobs in his company Satyam considered themselves very lucky
 satyam se judane vaale vyakti kii saamaajik sthiti swayan bad jaati thi
 Satyam soon became the fourth largest IT company in the country after starting its journey in 1987
 is pragati se duniyabar ke iti diggajaron kii ankhen chaundhiya gai or log satyam kaa gungan karne lage
 But all this later proved to be a smirk when it was found that the owner of the company, Ramalinga Raju, had overstated the company's profits for years
 ramalinga raju dwaara company ke laabh ko prativarsh badha-chadha kar prastut kiya jaataa
 But the secret of this progress came to the public on 7 January 2009, when the founder and chairman of the company Raju relinquished his post
 nideshkamandal or sebi ko likhe apane patr main unhone likhaa ki varshon se company kii vittiya sthiti kharaab chal rahi he
 He showed the company profit year after year to maintain the company's reputation in the market
 jiske liye company ke khaaton main her-pher kii gai
 On the other hand, the promoters' participation in the company's stock continued to decline
 jiske kaaran company kaa raaj khulne kaa khatra paidaa ho gaya
 And to avoid this, he decided to acquire his son-owned company Maytas
 unhone kaha ki satyam ko sankat se ubaarane ke liye unhone harsambhav prayaas kiya, lekin unke tamaam prayaason ke baavjood satyam kii sthiti lagaataar bigadati chali gai
 Raju said, "it is like riding a tiger, without knowing how to prevent it from becoming a diet"
 unhone likhaa ki wo doshi han or swayan ko kanoon ke hawaale karne ke liye taiyaar hai or ab wo har parinaam bhugatne ke liye taiyaar hai
 Everything that happened after this is in front of everyone
 satyam ke nideshkamandal or sebi ko is aashay kaa patr likhte hue unhone apana pad parityag kar diya
 At the time he relinquished his position, the value of one share of Satyam was Rs 188
 lekin shaam tak iskaa mulya keemat ghatakar maatr chalis rou rah gaya tha
 On the second day, this value came down to a minimum of 6
25 paise
 isse company main niveshkon ko lagbhag 100 arab rou kii haani hui
 The company's position is now in front of everyone
 company par se niveshkon kaa bharosa uth gaya
 His employees have started being afraid of coming on the road
 udhar, wipro or infosis jaise companiyon ke khaaton kaa hisaab rakhane vaali sanstha kepiemji kaa kahana he ki company main hue is ghotaale ke liye akele ramling raju uttaradaayi nahin hai, company ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari richarya reki ne kaha ki yah sab tark se pare he
 No one can say that everything written in this letter is correct
 abhi is baat par bharosa karnaa sahi nahin hoga ki jo kuch bhi hua uske liye akele raju uttaradaayi hai
 Rather, there is a need to bring all the people involved in the operation of accounts
 darasal company ke saath pareshaani us samay aarambh hui jab 16 disambar 2008 ko satyam computers ke nideshkamandal ne ek baithak bulaai or baithak main ramling raju ke beton kii swaamitv vaali company metas infrastracture or metas properties ke adhigrahan kaa prastaav paarit kiya
 The reasoning behind this acquisition was that it is impossible to maintain current growth in this phase of recession
 videshi mudraon kii tulana bhartiya mudra main ai giravat se baari dabaav paidaa hua
 The market areas where growth was seen till now were badly affected by the recession
 saath hi, out-sorcing ko lekar america sarkaar ne jo ravaiya apana rakhaa he, usase aane vaale samay main pareshaani or bhi bad sakati he
 In such a situation, the growth rate of the company can be maintained by investing in infrastructure, energy, etc
 besides IT
 baithak main bataaya gaya ki bharat agle paanch varshon main apane aadharbhoot dhaanchon ke vikaas par paanch sau arab dollar, jabaki china saadhe saat sau arab dollar kharch karegaa
 In this view, investing in the infrastructure sector can prove beneficial
 inhen sab tarkon ke saath satyam nideshkamandal ne 79
141 arabi rupayon main metas ke adhigrahan kaa nirnay liya
 Investing in real estate already hit by the recession was not acceptable to the investors of Satyam and they opposed the decision of the board of directors of Satyam
 is baat se logon ko aashcharya hua ki aakhir satyam ne real state kshetra main kudane kaa nirnay kyon liya
 There was also an objection to the decision as to why it was decided to invest in the company of Raju's son, Satyam chairman
 iskaa uttar raju ne apane patr main diya ki satyam ko tangi se ubaarane ke liye unhone aisa kiya
 The profit that the company gained from the acquisition of Maytas would offset its losses and deal with Maytas' liability later
 lekin niveshkon ke virodh ne sara gud gobar kar diya
 And the takeover decision was postponed
 puure maamle main kirakiri jhel rahe raju ne aakhirkaar sach ko saamne laane kaa nirnay kiya
 As soon as the truth came out, he started to tighten the screws on Satyam
 satyam ke chairman ko jail kii hawa khaani padi
 SEBI banned shares of Satyam
 udhar, neuyork stock exange main bhi satyam ke sheyaron par pratibandh laga diya gaya
 Dozens of cases were filed on Satyam
 sarkaar ne satyam ke kaamkaaj kii dekhbhaal ke liye teen sadasyeey samiti bana daali
 The committee also started its work
 udhar, satyam ke khaaton kii jaanch kaa daayitv esaio ko saunp diya gaya he
 The department has been asked to submit a report in three months
 yani jab tak prativedan aayega sarkaar loksabhaa chunaav main puri tarah uljhi rahegi
 a typical enlightened citizen must know what is to be accomplished of the report report
 centre or rajya main congress kii sarkaar he or vah satyam or raju ko bachaane ke liye puri tarah khulkar saamne aa gai he
 The argument is being made that the government is concerned about the interests of the employees
 yani sarkaar har maheene 5
2 arab rupee ke hisaab se teen maheene tak karmchaariyon ko vetan degi
 Millions of people are unemployed in the country, millions of people are coming on the streets every day, why the government is not worried about these people
 aakhir satyam ke un karmchaariyon kii chintaa sarkaar ko kyon sataane lagi jo kam se kam pachaas hajaar rupee masik vetan pate rahe hai
 Is it because they are in the beginning to live a life of peace and can no longer live a life of tightness? kangrasi sarkaar ko bihar main fanse chalis lakh longon kii chintaa kyon nahin sataayi to puri tarah barbaad ho chuke hai
 At that time, the Prime Minister had to do an aerial survey to declare Rs 10 billion, had to sort out the mathematics of votes from Lalu and Ram Vilas and today there is no hesitation in giving 20 billion rupees
 bhartiya nagarikon bhi ye bhi pataa he ki sarkaar ne un paison par bhi kar liya he, jise satyam ne kabhi kamaaya hi nahin, aakhir, sarkaar ab tak kahaan soti rahi
 Why he did not know that the letter of profit of Satyam is completely a bundle of lies
 vah or kab tak soti rahegi
 How long will he cheat the public in the statistics of economic development
 vah udyog gharaanon ke khaaton kii kyon nahin jaanch karwaati he
 Perhaps the government also knows that the people it will investigate are less happy with their abilities and more happy with gifts
 jo banker garib kisaanon se rin vasuuli ke liye har hatkandaa apnaane se nahin chookte wo satyam ko varshon-varsh galat intry kaise dete rahe
 There is still time to improve
 vikaas ke aankadon se baahar nikalakar thos dharaatal par kuch karne kii aavashyaktaa he

 Due to the inefficient administration of Sushim, rebellion arose in that area
 raja bindusaar ne susheem ke kehane par rajkumaar ashok ko vidroh ke daman ke liye vahaan bheja
 On hearing the news of Ashoka's arrival, the rebels ended the disturbance and the rebellion ended without any war
 haalaaki yahan par vidroh ek baar phir ashok ke shasankaal main hua tha, par is baar use balpurvak kuchal diya gaya

 In logic, mathematics and computer science, interpreting is the process of adding meaning to the symbols of a formal language
 adhikansh aupchaarik bhashaayen keval vaakyavinyas dwraara hi paribhaashit hoti hai or unamem koi nihit arth nahin hota
 To understand the meaning, it is necessary to associate the meaning with the signs
 ham ek w { \ displaystyle { \ mathcal {W}}} naamak aupchaarik bhashaa bana sakate hai, jisaki varnmaala α = { △, ◻ } { \ displaystyle \ alpha = \ { \ triangle , \ square \ }} he, or uskaa ek niyam he ki is bhashaa main sunirmit shabd △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle } se armbh hone chaiye or uske baad bhashaa kii varnmaala se lekar koi bhi chinh jitani baar chaahe daalaa ja saktaa he
 Now, as a result, some words in this language will be: △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle} △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle}, △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle} ◻ { \ displaystyle \ square}, △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle} ◻ { \ displaystyle \ square} ◻ { \ displaystyle \ square} ◻ { \ displaystyle \ square} △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle}
 yadi ◻ { \ displaystyle \ square } △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle } shabd dekha jaae jo yah bhashaa kaa shabd nahin he kyonki yah niyam-ulanghan karata he
 Now one possible interpretation of this language can be that we can give 0 { \ displaystyle \ square} as '0' and △ { \ displaystyle \ triangle} as '1'

 After years of study, when Albert Einstein announced this theory in 1916, the world of science was stirred up and the universe's vision announced in 1687 by Isaac Newton was permanently reversed for two and a half years
 bhautik shaastra par iskaa itnaa gaharaa prabhaav padaa ki log aadhunik bhautikee ko shastreey bhautikee se alag vishay bataane lage or albert oinstin ko aadhunik bhautikee kaa pita mana jane laga
 Dik is a Sanskrit word meaning place around
 ise angreji main "spes" kehete hai
 Humans have the ability to steam the three aspects of a problem - top-down, forward-backward and right-left
 aam jivan main manushya dik main koi badlaav nahin dekhte
 Newton's physics used to say that if two objects in space are one kilometer away from each other and neither of them move, they will remain one kilometer away from each other
 hamaara rose kaa saadhaaran jivan bhi hamen yahi dikhalaataa he
 But Einstein said that it is not so
 dik khich or sikud saktaa he
 It is also possible that the two objects which are one kilometer away from each other, should not move themselves, but due to some circumstances the problem may spread to a quarter and a quarter or a quarter to a quarter
 newton kii shastreey bhautikee main yah kaha jaataa tha ki brahmand main har jagah samay kii raftaar ek hi he
 If you are sitting in one place and a friend decides to travel for ten years at half the speed of light, then after that journey, you will have passed ten years and your friend too
 lekin inastin ne is par bhi kaha ki yah vishwaas galat he
 When something moves at a speed, time becomes slower for it and the faster it moves, the slower it becomes
 aapkaa mitra agar apane hisaab se das varsh tak roshni se aadhi gati par yatra kar ke laut aae, to uske to das saal guzarenge lekin aapke saadhe gyaarah saal guzar chuke honge
 Einstein showed in the theory of relativity that in fact there is a four-dimensional dikala in the universe, consisting of three periods of time and one in which all things and energies are located
 yah dik-kaal sthai nahin he- na dik bina kisi badlaav ke hota he or na yah zaruri he ki samay kaa bahaav har vastu ke liye ek jaisaa ho
 It can be twisted, pulled, and shrunk by affecting the time period, and the same happens in the universe
 is siddhanth ke madhyam se hi samay yatra kii avadharana nirmit hui he
 The change in time produces every object and every speed, but large objects and speeds near light produce more changes
 manushyon kaa aakaar itnaa chota or uski raftaar itani dhimi he ki unhen saapekshata siddhant ke asar apane jivan main nazar hi nahin aate, lekin jab vah brahmand main or chizon kaa gaur se adhyayan karte hai to saapekshata ke chinh kai jagahon par pate hai
 When the velocity of the object becomes even 5% of the velocity of light, then we start to see the signs of the theory of relativity
 newton kaa maananaa tha ki har vastu main apni ore khinchne kii ek shakti hoti he jise usne gurutvkarshan kaa naam diya
 In a big thing like Earth, this gravity is very high, due to which we stick to the Earth and do not fly away from space in space
 lekin yah newton nahin bataa paye ki gurutvkarshan bal vastav main kis prakaar kaary karata he or kyon kaary karata he
 Einstein said that according to the theory of relativity, the idea that material things attract each other is an illusion, which has arisen due to wrong mechanical assumptions about nature
 unhone kaha ki prithvi badi he or uski vajah se uske ird-gird kaa dik-kaal mud gaya he or apane upar tah ho gaya he
 We live in this difficult time and because of this twist, we are pushed closer to the earth
 isaki tulana ek chadar se kii ja sakati he jiske chaar cono ko chaar logon ne khinch ke pakadaa ho
 Now if a heavy ball is placed in the middle of this sheet, then the sheet will sit in the middle, that is, its yarn will be bent in the middle
 ab agar ek halaki gend ham chadar ke kone par rakhe to vah ludak kar bade gole kii taraf jaaegi
 Einstein said that a clumsy man could see that the small ball was pulled by the big ball, so the ball went to him
 lekin asli vajah thi ki gend zamin kii taraf janaa chaahati thi or gole ne chadar main kuch aisi mudan paidaa kii ki gend uske paas chali gai
 Similarly, he said that it is a myth that gravity is caused by some attraction
 gurutvkarshan kii asli vajah he ki har vastu jo antariksh main chal rahi hoti he, vah dik ke aisi mudan ke prabhaav main aakar kisi badi chiz kii ore chalane lagati he
 In fact, gravity is only a part of inertia, the movements of stars and planets arise from their characteristic inertia and their path depends on the circular elements of time and time
 jis prakaar chumbak ke chaaron ore chumbakeey kshetra hota he usee prakaar khagoleey vastu apane chaaron ore ke akaash main ek kshetra bikherti he
 Just as the activity of an iron piece in a magnetic field is guided by the design of the field, similarly the path of an object in a gravitational field is determined by the geometric state of that field
 oinstin kaa gurutvkarshan sambandhi niyam dikkaal satati ke kshetreey tatwon kii jaankaree detaa he
 Primarily a part of this rule expresses the relationship of the structure of the field around the gravitational object
 inastin ke is sansani failaa dene vaale siddhant kaa ek bahut bada pramaan roshni par gurutvkarshan kaa asar dekhne se aayaa
 Newton's theory in physics was that two objects pull each other according to the mass of the two
 lekin prakaash kaa to dravyaman hota hi nahin, yani shunya hota he
 So, according to Newton, there is no question of something that does not have any mass or weight, but it can be pulled from the gravity of another object, no matter how big the other object is
 prakaash hameshaa ek sidhi lakeer main chalata hi rahata he
 But if Einstein is right and due to some big thing, the problem should be turned, then the light should also be turned with difficulty
 yani brahmand main sthit badi vastuon ko lens kaa kaam karnaa chahie- jis tarah chashme, doorabeen yaa sookshmbin kaa lens prakaash modta he usee tarah taron or grahon ko bhi modana chahie
 In 1924, a Russian physicist named Ostra Kholson predicted Einstein's theory of relativity, predicting that such gravitational lenses would be there in the universe
 pachpan saal baad, 1979 main pehali dafaa yah chiz dekhi gai jab twin kwasar naam kii vastu kii ek ke bajaae do-do chhaviyaan dekhi gai
 After that such images of far-flung objects have been seen in which some very large object is placed between those objects and the earth, which acts as lenses on the rays of light coming from the first object and either torsion its image
 Or show more than one image of him in the sky

 espncricinfo was started in 1993 by Dr
 Simon King, a British researcher at the University of Minnesota, with the help of his friends and university researchers
 yah shuru main ek swayamsevak aadhaarit samuhik rup me sanchalit hui or ek saral iarasi bott ke rup main jivan kii shuruyaat kii
 It was soon made available through Gopher as well, and with the advent of the Mosaic web browser in April 1993, it became one of the oldest content websites on the Internet
 jabaki ek company, crickinfo limited kaa 1996 main gathan kiya gaya tha, crickinfo 1999 ke ant tak anivaary rup se swayamsevakon dwaara sanchalit rahi tathaa 2000 ke ant tak bhi puure karmchaaree nahin lagaae gaye the
 The site relied solely on contributions made by enthusiastic fans around the world, who spend hours creating electronic scorecards and contributing to Cricinfo's extensive archives, as well as using Cricinfo's software "doggy", worldwide Spent many hours recording live scores from the games that took place
 2006 main, iespncricainfo kaa anumaanit mulya 15 karod dollar tha
 espncricinfo's phenomenal growth in the 1990s made it an attractive site for investors during Dotcom's peak boom and in 2000 it acquired shares of Satyam Computer Services Ltd
 worth $ 370 million in exchange for a 25% stake in the company

 koi bhi email pate ke madhyam se samachaarpatr kii sadsyta le saktaa he yaa iespncricainfo tulbaar ko downlod kar saktaa he jo upyogkarta ko iespncricainfo kaa mukhaprishth dekhne, site talashne, desh ke iespncricainfo prishth par jane, sidhe score kaa anugaman karne, vartmaan tathaa tazaa samachar dekhne, aankade dekhne, blogs dekhne, iespncricainfo games par jane, audio prishthon par jane, ant main tulbaar par jane kaa avasar detaa he

 yahuu! pips kaa bhi upyog karte hue aam feeds ke milan tathaa mishran ke udhaaharan diye gayi hai
 Recently, espncricinfo and Moblica have launched the Saptu Application Network: a mobile espncricinfo application here
 24 farvari 2010 ko jis kshan sachin tendulkar ne ek divasiy main ucchtam nijee score, 200* kaa vishwa record todaa tab iespncricainfo website durghatnagrast ho gai thi
 This could be a result of the huge fan base that Sachin Tendulkar has and the ever-increasing popularity of espncricinfo's main website for the latest cricket news
 2006 main, mukhya rup se bharat main cricket prashansakon ko lakshith karke crickinfo patrika kii sthapana kii gayi gayi thi
 However, the magazine struggled to get enough readership, and in 2008 it ceased publication

 purvi tathaa pashchimi samaajon dwaara sampatti kaa prayog saamaajik sanghathan tathaa saamaajik rahan-sahan ke liye ek atyaavashyak vastu ke rup main hota rahaa he
 The meaning of the word property evolved from other ideas related to it, expressed by the words "object" or "race", "domus", and "master"
 bhashavigyaan ke anusaar sampatti shabd kii vyutpatti latin kriyavisheshan "propter" se hui he
 It evolved from the word "proprietus"
 propritas shabd roman vidhigyon dwaara bauddhik str par prayog main laayaa jane laga tathaa france kii bolchaal kii bhashaa main iskaa vyavhaar hone laga
 Gradually, the term property came to be used for land, money and other valuable things
 "sampatti" shabd kaa arth tab nishchit he jab is shabd kaa prayog ek parivaar or uske sadasyon se sambandhit vastuon kaa sambandh vyakt karne ke liye kiya jane laga
 Later, the tendency of the people to acquire and conserve the objects of individuals was recognized by the social conditions and the property began to be supported, seeing the rationale and necessity of its origin
 vah sammaan kii vastu ban gai tathaa uskaa vikaas saamaajik vishistataaonvali sanstha ke rup main hone laga
 In the primitive society, the official scholars of religion gave birth to the law, and in that society both property and family were unqualified words because both had their original religion and both were recognized by religion itself
 is prakaar sampatti, parivaar tathaa kanoon, aadim samaaj main sajaateey athwa sambhddha shabd the
 The Sanskrit word "griha" means etymology of home, the word "planet" which means to take, accept, snatch or conquer
 yah samaran rakhana chahie ki balpurvak athwa yuddh main jitkar adhigrahan atyant pracheen vidhi he
 According to Manu, the establishment of the Griha is the foundation of the householder or family
 "ghar" tathaa "parivaar" donon ke liye prayukt honevaale latin shabd "domus", "dominium" kaa mul he, jiskaa arth roman nyaayashastra main sampatti kaa aashay samajhane ke liye atyadhik mahatvapurn he
 "mancipium", "dominium" and "proprietus" are used equally for property or "ownership" in the jurisdiction
 mainsipium kaa arth he abhigrahan, adhikaar main karnaa, visheshkar bhoomi aadi
 The word "manshipium" is almost the same as the word "planet" in Sanskrit
 roman main "dominium" athwa "propierts" kaa arth un sab adhikaron kaa samooh he jisase swaamitv kaa bodh hota he
 Over time, "self" developed and gradually it came to be understood as the independent use of an object and the right to send or give it away
 aadim samaajon main sampatti ke saath dharmik bhaavana bhi judi rahati thi
 Where the land and its production were the main means of livelihood and the method of land acquisition was to be acquired by encroachment and conquest, the right to land and farming was considered as a kind of wealth and thus it was the major part of property belonging to a caste or family
 Was
 pariwarik sampatti unheen ke liye daay yogya thi jo apane purvajon ke liye dharmik anushthan kiya karte the
 Performing religious rituals for ancestors was considered the first duty of male descendants
 isliye kheti karne, bhoomi kaa bhoga karne tathaa isaki kray vikray karne kaa adhikaar janm se praapt ho jaataa tha
 The son's birth rights have been accepted by Mitakshara
 vijaneshwar ke anusaar janm hi sampatti kaa kaaran he
 It is a definite position of law in Hindu society that ancestral or ancestral property is acquired by birth
 dhire dhire sampatti kaa dharmik swaroop lupt hota gaya
 According to Mitakshara, property is an illustrious item because it is used for earthly transactions
 manusmriti ke tikaakaron ke matanusaar aaryon main sampatti kaa aashay puure parivaar se sambhddha hota tha jisamen putr, putree, patni tathaa das bhi sammilit the
 With the development of society, the son, daughter and wife were recognized as separate from the property, not considering the property or part of the property
 bhartiya kanoon main sapaatt kaa vidhik pratyay vaisaa hi hota he jaisaa angreji nyaayashastra main
 English law is very much influenced by Roman law
 "sampatti" shabd ke kai arth ho sakate hai yatha swaamitv yaa swatv, arthath swami ko praapt sampurna adhikaar
 Sometimes it means the Roman "race" under which the right of ownership is exercised, under which the right of ownership is exercised, ie the object itself which is the subject or character of the said right
 "res" athwa "vastu" kaa maanav se sambadh bataanevaala arth sampatti ke swaroop ke vikaas main sahaayak hua he
 Thus the sense of authority over "race" or "object" and the concept of "race" or "object" itself are complex and intimately related to the affinity suffix, ie both are complementary and supportive of each other
 roman main "res" kaa arth atyant jatil he
 It is a solid object of authority like English
 kintu "res" kaa thik thik arth "vastu" ke bilkul samaan nahin he, usase kuch adhik he
 Although the original meaning of "race" is a physical object, it was gradually used to express an asset that could be not only physical and physical but also intangible such as electricity
 "res" kaa prayog vishishtadhikaar ke liye bhi hota he or aise adhikaron ke liye bhi jo, udaahranarth, prasiddhi yaa khyaati se utpann hote hai
 Thus, due to the frequent use of race for these two meanings, "race" has two meanings: "race earth" means material things which can come under the rights of human beings and "race inactive" means those rights themselves
 is prakaar antim vishleshan ke falswaroop "vastu" kaa aashay "res parthiv" se hi liya jayega
 In Roman language "race" is used for both property and possession of property, but the word "sow", which is used for goods or money, is equivalent to the word "wealth" in Sanskrit
 arabi juriyon ke anusaar "maal" shabd sampatti tathaa kisi bhi aisi vastu ke liye prayukt ho saktaa he jiskaa arabi kanoon main mulya yaa arth ho athwa jo kisi vyakti ke adhikaar main rah sakati ho
 The word "money" is also often used for property
 sampatti ke arth main prayukt honevaali vastu main sthayitv kaa tathaa bhautik ekatv kaa gun hona aavashyak he
 a collection of units whose units are themselves separate objects and an object made up of the inclusion of such single units can also be called objects; Such as a house made of brick or bricks or a sheep or a hut made of many sheep
 kanoon main vastu kaa prayog kuch adhikaron evam kartavyon ko vyakt karne ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 Depending on physical properties, an "object" can be of two types - movable or immovable
 lekin agreji kanoon ke takneekee niyamon ke anusaar vastu, vaastavik tathaa vyaktigat hoti he
 According to Roman law, "race" is similarly divided into "mansepebul" and unmanciple
 is prakaar sampatti ek or "res" yaa "vastu" or duusari ore res athwa vastu se sambandhit manushya ke adhikaron se sambhddha he
 Therefore, a person is required for the property, who can hold his authority over something
 antim vishleshan ke anusaar sampatti, ek vyakti or ek vastu yaa adhikaar, jise vah keval apana maanata ho, ke madhya sthapit sambadh ko vyakt karti he
 In its modern experiments property is used for all goods or property which belongs to a person or has been dedicated to another person but reserves the right to arrange that item for their benefit
 res yaa vastu ke parthiv or aparthiv vargeekaran tathaa vastu yaa adhikaron ke swaroop ke anusaar sampatti kaa vargeekaran vibhinn prakaar se hua he jaise, parthiv yaa aparthiv; chal yaa achal tathaa vaastavik yaa vyaktigat
 Joint taxation of property with other specific terms such as personal or public, paternal, liable, joint family, unofficial, etc
 expresses a relationship with the nature of the property
 sampatti kii vaidhanik vyakhya ke anusaar iske kai arth he
 The property also bears the fruits of physical and mental exertion done by a person
 koi bhi vyakti apni kisi vastu ke badale main jo kuch bhi paata he, jo kuch bhi use diya jaataa he or jise kanoon dwaara us vyakti kaa mana jaataa he athwa use prayog karne, bhoga karne tathaa vyavastha karne kaa adhikaar pradaan kiya jaataa he, vah sab us vyakti kii vyaktigat sampatti kehalaati he
 But if it is not recognized by law, it cannot be called property and then there is no relation between the person and the object in terms of legal consequences
 vasudha hindi kii saahitiyik patrika he
 Its founder editor was Harishankar Parsai
 iskaa prakaashan masik rup main aarambh hua tha, parantu baad main yah tremasik rup main prakashit hoti rahi he

 That is, issue-63 was published as January 2005, year-1, issue-1
 haalanki is ank main varsh evam ank sankhya kaa ullekh nahin kiya gaya tha, parantu ank-64, march 2005 main pramukhataa se varsh-1, ank-2 ullikhit tha
 Besides the editor-in-chief Kamla Prasad, its editors have been Prakash and Rajendra Sharma for a long time
 kamala prasad ji pradhan sampadak niyukt hone ke samay se aaajeevan vasudha ke liye praanapan se jude rahe
 Its editorial office was also his residence 'M31, Nirala Nagar'
 ank-87 tak ke sampadan ke baad 25 march 2011 ko unka nidhan ho jane ke kaaran ank-88 se sampadan kaa daayitv swayan prakaash evam rajendra sharma ke dwaara hi sanbhaala gaya
 Now its office has come to 'mayaram Surjan Smriti Bhawan, Shastri Nagar, P&T Square, Bhopal-3'
 ank-95 ke baad swayan prakaash ji bhi iske sampadan se hat gayi tathaa ank-96 kaa prakaashan bhinn rup main keval rajendra sharma ke sampadan main hua
 Till Issue-95, a tagline on the front page of 'progressive Vasudha' kept going as 'publication of Progressive Writers Association'
 ank 96 se yah 'madhya pradesh pragatisheel lekhak sangh kaa prakaashan' ke rup main badal gayi
 It was announced in this issue that it will be published in this form only for the next 4 digits
 "is bich pragatisheel vasudha ke liye sarvatha nayi sampadakeey or vyavasthaapakiy team kaa gathan karne ke prayaas kiye jaayenge, tab harishankar parasaai or ab kamala prasad dwaara sthapit 'vasudha' kii yah teesri aavriti hogi
 " samrudh tathaa stareey visheshank nikaalane ke kshetra main 'vasudha' agrani patrika rahi he
 However, its general numerals as 'progressive vasudha' have also been treated like adjectives, but more than that; Nevertheless, this magazine has set a benchmark of records through many specialties
 'vasudha' ke ank-51 ke rup main dow0 ramvilas sharma par kendrit visheshank kaa prakaashan hua, jo atyadhik charchit rahaa
 Even before this, many specialties of the magazine have been in discussion
