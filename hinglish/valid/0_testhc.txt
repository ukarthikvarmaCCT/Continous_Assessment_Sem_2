 yah kriya vah lamben samay se karti chali aa rahi thi

 vah budhiya apane ghar ko shuddh karne ke liye, paddos main rahane vaali ek anya budhiya kii gaay kaa gobar laayaa karti thi
 The house from which she used to bring old cow dung, she started to think why it brings my cow dung
 isaliye vah apni gaay ko ghar ke bheetar baandhle lagi
 Due to non-receipt of old cow dung, she could not cleanse her house on Sunday and dipped it with cow dung
 iske kaaran na to usne bhojan hi banaaya or na hi bhoga hi lagaaya

 That is why in the Mahavani, the meditation of the vihara-leen naval-kishore has been instructed ~ The Kadamba Dynasty was an ancient royal family of Karnataka that ruled from Banavasi in present day Uttara Kannada district
 The dynasty later continued to rule as a feudatory of larger Kannada empires, the Chalukya and the Rashtrakuta empires for over five hundred years during which time they branched into Goa and Hanagal
 At the peak of their power under King Kakushtavarma, they ruled large parts of Karnataka
 During the pre-kadamba era the ruling families that controlled Karnataka, the Mauryas, Satavahanas and Chutus were not natives of the region and the nucleus of power resided outside present day Karnataka
 The Kadambas were the first indigenous dynasty to use Kannada, the language of the soil at an administrative level
 In the history of Karnataka, this era serves as a broad based historical starting point in the study of the development of region as an enduring geo-political entity and Kannada as an important regional language

 His most recent target is a Japanese businessman named Sayto
 lekin saito ke raaj churaane ke dauraan unheen sapanom main kaab ko apni marhoom bivi mail kii yaadon kii dakhlandji se ve naakaam hote he
 But according to Sayto, he was merely examining them, so that he could carry out the difficult task of "inventing" an idea within another's heart
 uskaa ek biimaar pratispardhi marish fiqar he jo ek urja utpaadan ke ekikrut maalik he; saito chahta he ki kaab us fiqar or uske bataur vaaris bete, rabart fiqar, ke bich takaraar kaa phayda uthaakar uske pita kii company bikher de
 In return, Sayto promises that he will eradicate the accusation of killing the cab on the strength of his power, so that the cab can go back home to visit its children
 kaab vah prastaav manjuur karata he or apni team ikatthi karata he, jiname se vah: ams, ek shaatir thag or jaalsaaj baharoopiya; yusuf, ek chemist jiske paas ek behad tej nashili dawa he jo "sapane ke bheetar ek or sapana" dekhne kii kshamta badhaata he; ariadne, ek architekchar kii chaatra jise sapanom ke dauraan bhulabhalaiya jaisi rachanaayen banane kaa jimmaa miltaa he,jiske intjaam kii sifarish kaab ke sasur, professor stephen miles karte hai
 Sayto remains attached to the team to ensure their success
 par jab ariadne saajhe sapanom ke saath kaab ke antarman main jhaankne kii koshish karti he, to use ehsaas hota he ki mail uske antarman main dakhlandji karanevaale par aksar hamalaa kar baahar kar detii he
 At the same time, Robert Fisher takes him on a ten-hour flight to get him cremated in Los Angeles after Maurice Fischer arrives in Sydney, with his team keeping the occasion solemn and Fisher's shared dream in every possible way Plan outlines
 sapanom kii tah main lagbhag harek level main ghuskar vaapis aane ke liye, un sabhi sadasyo ko gahari neend se ekasaath jagaane ke liye lagbhag ek hi "jatke" ke jarurat he
 According to the plan, at the first level Yusuf drops the car from the bridge, at the second level, Arthur resorts to the elevator and at the end of the third level, Aims, taking out everyone together through an explosion
 lekin sapanom kii duniya main marane ke baavjood ve us tej dawa ke asar se jaag nahin paayenge jinase unhone anginat level ke sapanom ko der tak banaae rakhane kaa seven kiya tha
 Here, they will be caught in a "limbo" or almost coma-like situation with death, where there will be infinite and infinite gaps of inner being which are very difficult to escape
 pehle sapane kii tah main, team yusuf ke sapane ke jariye barsaat bhare las angeles main daakhil hoti he
 Here the team arrives to abduct Fischer, but his bodyguard composed in his rescue system shoots there and injures Sayto

 Here, the team of CAB tries to break into pieces and move inside to remove the guards so that the fissure can be coordinated
 yusuf, apane pehle level ko anusaran karte hue, gaadi drive karte hue pul se giraata he or jald hi pehla jhatka shuru karata he
 This removes gravity from Arthur's level, causing ice to slide at Ames' level
 ams, fouran vine ke pani se takaraane se purv ek saath jatke se ubarne kii taiyaari main jute jaataa he
 But in the projecting of the cab, Mel then shoots Fischer, and as soon as the severely wounded Sayto dies, both of them are lost in that uncertain world
 is darmyaan ams jatke kii taiyaari ke durg main jagah-jagah visphotak lagaataa he, kaab or ariadne tab fiqar evam saito dundhane ke liye coma main jate hai
 The cab then tells Ariadne about going into limbo through her and Mel's shared dreams
 jahaan donon ne takreeban pachaas saal apni yaadon se duniya banaate hue vakt guzaara tha
 But Mel refuses to return to reality, as Kaab unwittingly puts his mind into thinking that his world is not true, and that his early lessons were shaped
 haalaanki, jab wo neend se jaagi, to mail ko yahi yakeen hone lag gaya ki wo vaastavik duniya main nahin he
 To "wake up" in her real world, she commits suicide, forcing her to die with the cab
 katl ke aarope se bachane ke liye, kaab america se faraar hota he, or bacchon kii dekhbhaal professor miles ke jimme saunpta he
 With this cousin confessing, Cobb succeeds in his atonement, and departs from the conscience in the final endless world to find Sayto, leaving him relaxed
 ariadne bhi fiqar ko khoj nikaalte use jhatka dilaakar jagaati he
 Fisher is alive again in the mountain fortress where the safe room is to be found, through the dying father present in it, to motivate him to the idea: in which his father asks him to be his own
 udhar kaab or saito ke alaava baaki sabhi sadsy ek hi vakt main bhinn jhatkon se vaastaviktaa ko lautati he: jaise ariadne kaa balakani par se kud janaa, ams ke lagaae visphotak jo durg ko tabah karte he, arthur dhamaake ke jariye alevator main maujuud soyi hui team ko takaraav se jagaata he, or vine bhi tab tak pani kii sataha se takaraata he
 The cab finally reminds her of her accolades, having found the aged Sayto in that interim world
 donon phir usee hawaizhaj main jaagate hai, jahaan pehle hi baaki kii team or rabart fiqar jaag chuke the
 At the Los Angeles airport, Cab receives clearance at the US Immigration Detection Center and takes her father-in-law to her children while they wait

 aamtaur par archimedes ko pracheen kaal kaa sabase mahaan ganitagya mana jaataa he or sab samay ke mahanatam logon main se ek kaha jaataa he
 He used the method of completeness to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola, for which he used infinite series summation and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of pi
 unhone ek archimedes sarpil ko bhi paribhaashit kiya, jo unke naam par aadhaarit he, ghurnan kii sataha ke aaytan ke liye sutara die or bahut badi sankhyaon ko vyakt karne ke liye ek saral pranali bhi di
 Archimedes was killed during the siege of Syracuse when he was assassinated by a Roman soldier, although it was ordered that he should do no harm
 siciro archimedis kaa makbara, jo ek belan ke andar andar sthit gumbad kii tarah he, par jane kaa varnan karte hai ki, archimedes ne sabit kiya tha ki gole kaa aaytan or isaki sataha kaa kshetrafal belan kaa do tihaai hota he or ise unki ek mahanatam ganitiya uplabdhi mana jaataa he
 Unlike his inventions, Archimedes' mathematical writing was little known in ancient times
 alegsenderiya se ganitagyon ne unhen padhaa or uddhrut kiya, lekin pehla vyaakhyaatmak sankalan si
 tak nahin kiya gaya tha
 This was done by Isidore of Miletus in 530 AD, when Eutokias wrote commentaries on the works of Archimedes in the sixth century AD and for the first time they were made widely available for reading
 archimedes ke likhit kaary kii kuch pratilipiyaan jo madhya yug tak bani raheen, ve punarjagran ke dauraan vaigyanikon ke liye vichaaron kaa pramukh strot thim, haalanki archimedes palimpset main archimedes ke dwaara pehle se kiye gaye agyaat kaary kii khoj 1906 main kii gayi thi, jisase is vishay ko ek nayi antardrushti pradaan kii ki unhone ganitiya parinaamon ko kaise praapt kiya
 Archimedes was born in 287 BC Syracuse, took place in a township of Magna Gracia in the port city of Sicily
 unke janm kii taarikh, bijantin unani itihaaskaar jon zetazes ke kathan par aadhaarit he, iske anusaar archimedes 75 varsh tak jivit rahe
 In The Sand Reckoner, Archimedes names his father Phidias, who according to him was an astronomer, about whom nothing is known
 plutark ne apni perelal lines main likhaa ki archimedes seracus ke shaasha, raja hero se sambandhit the
 a biography of Archimedes was written by his friend Heraclidus, but his work is lost, leaving details of his life unclear
 udhaaharan ke liye, yah agyaat he ki vah shaadi shuda the yaa nahin yaa unke bachche the yaa nahin
 Archimedes probably studied in his youth in Alexandria, Egypt, where he was a contemporary of Conan of Samos and Eratosthenes of Cyrene
 unhen unke mitra kii tarah samos ke conan se sandarbhit kiya jaataa tha, jabaki unke do kaaryo ) kaa parichay iratosthenej ke sambodhan se diya jaataa tha
 Archimedes died c 212 BC The Second Punic War took place when Roman armies led by General Marcus Claudius Marcellus captured the city of Syracuse after a two-year siege
 plutark ke dwaara die gaye lokapriy vivaran ke anusaar, archimedes ek ganitiya chitra par vichaar kar rahe the, jab shahar par kabza kiya gaya
 a Roman soldier ordered him to come and meet General Marcellus, but he refused, saying that he had to complete work on his problem
 isse sainik naaraaz ho gaya or usne apni talwaar se archimedes ko maar daalaa
 Plutarch also gives an account of the death of Archimedes, less-known, stating that he was probably killed when he was attempting to surrender to a Roman soldier
 is kahani ke anusaar, archimedes ganitiya upkaran le ja rahe the or unhen isliye maar diya gaya kyonki sainik ne sochaa ki ye keemtee saamaan he
 General Marcellus is said to have been greatly enraged by Archimedes' death, as he considered him an invaluable scientific asset and ordered that Archimedes should not be harmed in any way

 These words are often described in Latin as "noli turbare circulos meos", but there is no reliable evidence that Archimedes uttered these words and they are not found in the description given by Plutarch

 The account of the siege of Syracuse given by Polybius was written in his Universal History about 70 years after the death of Archimedes and was later used as a source by Plutarch and Livy

 The most widely known fact about Archimedes is how he discovered a method for determining the volume of an object of an irregular shape
 vitruvius ke anusaar, raja hero II ke liye ek lorel vreth ke aakaar kaa ek nayaa mukut banaaya gaya tha or archimedes se yah pataa lagane ke liye kaha gaya ki yah mukut shuddh sone se bana he yaa beyimaan sunar ne isamen chaandi milaayi he
 Archimedes had to solve this problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it into a regular-sized object to calculate its density
 nahaate samay, unhone dekha ki jab ve tub ke andar gaye, tub main pani kaa str upar uth gaya or unhone mahasoos kiya ki is prabhaav kaa upyog mukut ke aaytan ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Water cannot be compressed for practical purposes, so the submerged crown will replace its volume with equal amounts of water
 mukut ke bhaar ko pratisthapit pani ke aaytan se vibhajit karke, mukut kaa ghanatv praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 If cheap and low density metals are added to it, then its density will be less than gold
 phir kya tha, archimedes apni is khoj se itane zyada uttejit ho gaye ki ve kapadey pahananaa hi bhul gaye or nagn avasthaa main galiyon main bhaagate hue chillane lage "ureka !" The story of the gold crown does not appear in the known works of Archimedes
 iske alaava, pani ke visthaapan ke maapan main aavashyak sateekta kii atyadhik maatra ke kaaran, iske dwaara varnit vidhi kii vyavhaarikta par sawaal uthaaye gaye hai
 Perhaps Archimedes gave a solution that applied to a theory called Archimedes' theory in hydrology, which he describes in one of his texts on floating bodies
 is siddhant ke anusaar ek taral main dubi hui vastu par ek utplavan bal lagata he jo iske dwaara hathaaye gaye taral ke bhaar ke baraabar hota he
 Using this principle, it would have been possible to compare the density of the gold crown with solid gold, for which the crown would have been first balanced on a scale with a sample of gold, then the mechanism would have been immersed in water
 
 yadi mukut sone se kam ghanaa tha, isane apane adhik aaytan ke kaaran adhik pani ko pratisthapit kiya hoga or is prakaar is par lagane vaale utplavan bal kii maatra namoonay se adhik rahi hogi
 This difference in buoyancy may have been seen on the scale

 1906 main unhone kapadon main gaay kii charbi ke prayog kiye jane ke khilaaf andolan chalaaya or videshi vastuon or videshi kapadon ke bahishkaar ke liye sangharsh ched diya
 He started using Khadi and indigenous items in his youth
 vikram samvath 1971 main jab mahaamanaa pan
 madan mohan malviya banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana ke liye dhan sangrah karne ke uddeshy se kalakatta aae to bhayeeji ne kai logon se milakar is kaary ke liye daan-raashi dilwaai
 In a case of working with the freedom movement and revolutionaries in Calcutta, the then British government arrested several prominent traders including Hanuman Prasad Poddar and sent them to jail on charges of treason
 in logon ne british sarkaar ke hathiyaaron ke ek jakhire ko lootakar use chhipaane main madad kii thi
 In jail, Bhaiji started worshiping Hanuman ji
 baad main unhen alipur jail main nazarband kar diya gaya
 During the detention, Bhaiji used his time well and there he used to start his daily routine at three in the morning and spend the whole time meditating on God
 baad main unhen najarband rakhte hue punjab kii shimalpal jail main bhej diya gaya
 There, a homeopathic doctor used to come to jail to check the health of the prisoners, Bhai ji learned the nuances of homeopathy from this doctor and after studying the books of homeopathy started treating the patients on their own
 baad main ve jamanalaal bajaj kii prerana se mumbai chale aae
 Here he came in close contact with personalities like Veer Savarkar, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Mahadev Desai and Krishnadas Jaju
 mumbai main unhone agarwal navayuvakon ko sangathit kar marwari khaadi prachaar mandal kii sthapana kii
 After this, he came in the satsang of the famous music composer Vishnu Digambar and music flowed in his heart
 phir unhone bhakthi geet likhe jo `patr-pushp' ke naam se prakashit hue
 In Mumbai, he was very impressed with the Gita recitation of his cousin Jayadayal Goenka
 unke gita ke prati prem or logon kii gita ko lekar jigyaasa ko dekhte hue bhai ji ne is baat kaa pran kiya ki ve shrimad bhagavadgita ko kam se kam mulya par logon ko uplabdh karaayenge
 He then wrote a commentary on the Gita and printed it in the commercial press of Calcutta
 pehle hi sanskaran kii paanch hajaar pratiyaan bik gai
 But Bhaiji was sad that there were many mistakes in this book
 iske baad unhone iskaa sanshodhit sanskaran nikaala magar isamen bhi galtiyaan doharaa gai thi
 This hurt Bhai ji's mind and he decided that unless he had his own press, this work would not proceed
 bas yahi ek chota sa sankalp gita press gorakhpur kii sthapana kaa aadhaar bana
 His brother Goenka ji's business was in Bankura at that time and he used to stay outside often in the discourse on Gita
 tab samasya yah thi ki press kahan lagaai jaae
 His friend Ghanshyam Das used to do business in Jalan Gorakhpur
 unhone press gorakhpur main hi lagaae jane or is kaary main bharpoor sahyog dene kaa aashwaasan diya
 After this, Geeta Press was established on 29 April 1923
 == kalyaan kaa armbh samvath 1983 vikrami main marwari agarwal mahasabha kaa vaarshik adhiveshan dilli main hua
 Its Chairman was Seth Jamnalal Bajaj and the Chairman was Shri Atmaram Khemka
 Initially, Khemkaji refused to be the head of the Swatantra for some reasons, later he agreed to the insistence of Seth Jayadayal Goindka
 adhiveshan jaldi prarambh honevaala tha prashn udha swaagat bhaashan likhane kaa | khemka ji shastrajna tathaa vidwaan the, par unhen hindi likhane kaa abhyaas nahin tha
 He requested Shri Goindka to get the speech prepared
 shri goyandaka ji ne poddar ji ko dilli jaakar bhaashan taiyaar karne kaa aadesh diya
 Poddar went to Delhi and in 24 hours wrote and printed an extremely abstract speech
 log usamen vyakt vichaaron se bahut prabhavit hue | adhiveshan main bhaag lene ke liye seth ghanashyam das birla bhi aaye the
 Although he did not have complete consensus with Podar ji, however, he liked the speech
 duusare din apni pratikraya vyakt karte hue unhone poddar ji se kaha -- bheji tumlogon ke kya vichaar hai kaise hai kahantak thik hai isaki aalochana hamen nahin kerani | par inkaa prachaar tumlogon dwaara samaaj main ho rahaa he janata ise dur tak maanati bhi he
 If you had, you would get more success
 You take out a letter of your thoughts
 Poddarji said - the matter is fine but i have no experience in this regard
 Birla Ji urged and said try
 At that time the matter ended here
 Ghanshyam Das ji had said one thing as a consultation
 But this became the reason for the birth of Kalyan monthly
 After the session ended, all the people went to their respective places
 Poddar ji proceeded towards Bombay
 In those days, to go from Delhi to Bombay, one had to go to Ahmedabad via Rewari and from there change the car to Bombay
 Poddar went to Rewari from Delhi
 There was a half-hour route from Rewari to Bhiwani
 Poddar ji came to Bhiwani on those days from Churu and went there to meet Seth Jayadayal Goindkaji one day
 Seth ji had to go to Bankura and Poddar ji was in Bombay
 Both came together from Bhiwani to Rewari
 On the way, he discusses the suggestion given by Ghanshyam Das Seth ji liked the idea that along with Seth ji, he had Lachhiram Murodiya
 He also agreed
 He took a promise from Poddar ji that he would give two hours of time each day for editing
 Poddar talked about his inexperience, but Murodiyaji silenced him
 Now the question of name came
 "kalyan" came out of Poddar's mouth
 Seth ji and Murodia ji liked this name
 This is the case of Chaitra Shukla 9th Samvat 1983 on the day of Shri Rama Navami
 With this it was decided that welfare should be started with Akshaya Tritiya
 | Seth ji and Murodia ji liked this name

 kalyaan ko or bhi rochak va gyanavardhak banane ke liye samay-samay par iske alag-alag vishyon par visheshank prakashit kiye gaye
 Bhai ji, during his lifetime, kept away from propagating such works which can only be imagined
 1936 main gorakhpur main bhayankar baadh aagai thi
 When Jawaharlal Nehru came to Gorakhpur for inspection of the flood-affected area, no person provided him a car under the pressure of the then British Government, because the British Collector had given a bully to all the people that whatever Nehru ji Car will give his name written in the list of rebels
 lekin bhai ji ne apni car nehru ji ko de di
 In 1938, when there was a severe famine in Rajasthan, Bhai ji reached the famine affected area and he made fodder for the famine victims as well as cattle

 Bhai ji also contributed a lot in the cow protection movement
 san 1966 ke viraat goraksha aandolan me mahatma ramachandra vir dwaara kiye gayi 166 din ke anshan kaa inhone pura samarthan kiya
 There are many miraculous and inspiring events related to Bhai ji's life
 lekin unke jivan kii sabase mahatvapurn baat yahi he ki ek sampann parivaar se sambandh rakhane or apane jivan kaal main kai mahatvapurn logon se jude hone or unki nikatataa praapt karne ke baavjood bhai ji ko abhimaan chhu tak nahin gaya tha
 He kept thinking for the common man for a lifetime
 is desh main sanathan dharm or dharmik sahitya ke prachaar or prasar main unka yogadan ullekhneey he
 He did not take a portion of the income generated from the publication of books from Geeta Press Gorakhpur and made a written document that no member of his family would be a shareholder in its income
 angrejon ke jamaane main gorakhpur main unki dharm va sahitya seva tathaa unki lokapriyata ko dekhte hue tatkaaleen angrej colector pedley ne unhen `raay sahab' kii oopaadhi se alankrita karne kaa prastaav rakhaa tha, lekin bhai ji ne vinamratapurvak is prastaav ko asweekaar kar diya
 After this, British Commissioner Hobart proposed to confer the title of 'rai Bahadur' but Bhai ji did not accept this proposal either
 desh kii swadhinata ke baad dow, sampoornanand, kanhaiyalaal munshi or anya logon ke paraamarsh se tatkaaleen kendriya grih mantri govind vallabh pant ne bhai ji ko `bharat ratna' kii oopaadhi se alankrita karne kaa prastaav rakhaa lekin bhai ji ne isamen bhi koi ruchi nahin dikhaai
 On 22 March 1971, Bhai Ji renounced this mortal body and left behind him a center known as 'geeta Press Gorakhpur', which is playing a leading role in spreading our culture across the world

 Spray towers or spray chambers are a form of pollution control technology
 ve khaali belanaakaar steel yaa plastic ke bane jahaajon or nalika ki vahikaaon main spray taral se milakar banataa he
 The inlet gas stream usually enters the bottom of the tower and moves upward, while the liquid is sprayed from one or more levels below
 Inlet or vipareet disha main gas taral ke is pravaah pratidhaara pravaah kaha jaataa he
 Figure 1 shows a typical spray countercurrent flow tower
 praudyogiki ke is prakaar samuhik rup se geela scrubbers ke rup main sanderbhit vaayu pradooshan niyantran ke samooh kaa ek hissaa he
 The countercurrent flow exposes the outlet gas with the lowest pollutant concentration to the freshest scrubbing liquid
 kai nalika tower bhar main alag alag oonchai par gas ke sabhi spray ke rup main yah tower ke madhyam se chaalen upar rakhaa jaataa he
 The reasons for using multiple nozzles are for fine pollutant particles to maximize the number of droplets affected and to provide a larger surface area for the gas to absorb
 siddhanthata, chote buundon kaa gathan, ucch sangrah kshamta donon gasiy kan or pradooshan ke liye hasil kii he
 However, liquid droplets must be large enough not to scrub out the scrub from the bush outlet gas stream
 isliye, spray toweron nalika kaa upyog karne ke liye hai ki aam taur par kar rahe hai vyas main 500 se 1000 sukshmamapi buundon kaa utpaadan
 aakaar main chote haalanki, in buundon VENTURI scrubar he ki aakaar main 10 se 50 sukshmamapi main banaaya un logon kii tulana main bade hai
 The gas velocity is kept low, 0
3 to 1
2 m / s to prevent more droplets from being carried out of the tower
 aadesh main kam gas veg ko banaae rakhane ke liye, spray toweron anya scrubar he ki isi tarah kii gas dhara pravaah daron sambhaal kii tulana main bada hona chahie
 Another problem occurring in spray towers is that after the droplets fall in short distances, they tend to agglomerate or hit the walls of the tower
 As a result, the total liquid surface area for the contact is reduced, reducing the collection capacity of the scrubber
 chitra 2 - Crosscurrent pravaah spray towerek vinyas pratidhaara pravaah ke alaava, spray toweron main pravaah yaa to ek yaa vinyas main cocurrent crosscurrent ja saktaa he
 Cocurrent flow in spray towers, inlet gas and liquid flow in one direction
 Because the gas stream does not "push" against the liquid spray, the gas velocities through the vessels are greater in the countercurrentflow spray towers
 natijatan, cocurrent pravaah spray toweron pratidhaara pravaah spray toweron nikaas ke pravaah kii ek hi raashi ke ilaaj kii tulana main chote hote hai
 Crosscurrent flow spray towers, also called horizontal spray scrubbers, perpendicular to each other in gas and liquid flow directions
 is pot main gas kshaitij spray virgon ke ek number ke madhyam se bahati he
 The amount and quality of the spraying fluid in each section can vary, usually with the clear liquid sprayed in the final set of sprays

 In India, 'darshan' is called the technique by which the element can be interviewed
 'tatv darshan' yaa 'darshan' kaa arth he tatv kaa saakshaatkaar
 Philosophy has been born in India only to eradicate human suffering and / or to conduct elemental interviews

 Manu says that on receiving the right vision, karma cannot put a person in bondage and those who do not have a proper vision get trapped in the glorification and trap of the world
 bhartiya rishion ne jagat ke rahasy ko anek konon se samajhane kii koshish kii he
 About Indian philosophers, TS Eliot had said- bhartiya darshan kis prakaar or kin paristhitiyon main astitv main aayaa, kuch bhi pramanik rup se nahin kaha ja saktaa
 But it is so clear that during the Upanishad period, philosophy started developing as a separate scripture
 tattvon ke anveshan kii pravriti bharatvarsh main us sudur kaal se he, jise ham 'vaidic yug' ke naam se pukaarte hai
 Since the very ancient era of the Rigveda, we have a philosophy of dualistic tendency and dual goals in Indian thought
 pratham pravriti pratibha yaa pragnamulak he tathaa dwitiya pravriti tarkmulak he
 It is only by the power of wisdom that the first tendency works in the deliberation of the elements and the second tendency is able to review the elements with the help of logic
 angreji shabdon main pehali kii ham ‘intutionistic’ kah sakate hai or duusari ko reshanlistic
 There were two types of goals from the beginning itself - the acquisition of wealth and the interview of Brahma
 pragnamulak or tark-mulak pravritiyon ke paraspar sammilan se aatma ke aupnishadishth tatvagyan kaa sfoot aavirbhaav hua
 The knowledge of the Upanishads was emanated in the paradigmatic Vedanta, which proved the unification of the soul and the divine
 bhartiya manishiyon ke urvar mastishk se jis karm, gyaan or bhakthimay tripathga kaa pravaah udbhoot hua, usne dur-dur ke maanvon ke aadhyatmik kalmsh ko dhokar unhenne pavitra, nity-shuddh-buddha or sadaa svachh banaakar maanavtaa ke vikaas main yogadan diya he
 People call this impure stream called Darshan
 anveshakon kaa vichaar he ki is shabd kaa vartmaan arth main sabase pehla prayog vaisheshik darshan main hua
 The word 'darshan', according to Paninian grammar, is derived from affixing lute to 'darshi varshana' dhatu
 atev darshan shabd kaa arth drushti yaa dekhnaa, ‘jiske dwaara dekha jaay’ yaa ‘jisamen dekha jaay’ hoga
 The meaning of the word darshan is not just to see or to see normal
 isiilie panini ne dhatworth main ‘prekshan’ shabd kaa prayog kiya he
 The excellent test, in which observing or contemplating conclusions is taken by philosophy
 is prakaar ke prakrusht ikshan ke saadhan or fal donon kaa naam darshan he
 Where these principles are compiled, those books will also be named Darshan, such as Nyaya Darshan, Vaiseshika Darshan, Mimamsa Darshan, etc
 darshan granthon ko darshanashastra bhi kehete hai
 This scripture is derived from the word 'shasu Anushyau'
 darshanon kaa upadesh vaiyaktik jivan ke sammarjan or parishkaran ke liye hi adhik upyogi he
 Spiritual purity and elevation without darshan is rare
 darshan-shaastra hi hamen pramaan or tark ke sahare andhkaar main dipajyoti pradaan karke hamaara maarg-darshan karne main samarth hota he
 According to the Gita, Karma Kimkarmeti Kavayopatyatra Mohita: The attainment of ultimate goal and effort is possible only through philosophical knowledge, otherwise not
 darshan dwaara vishyon ko ham sankshep main do virgon main rakh sakate hai
 Cosmic and supernatural or physical and spiritual
 darshan yaa to vistrut sristi prapanch ke vishay main siddhanth yaa aatma ke vishay main hamase charchaa karata he
 Thus the subject of philosophy is both inert and conscious
 pracheen rigvaidic kaal se hi darshanon ke mul tattvon ke vishay main kuch na kuch sanket hamaare aarsh sahitya main milte hai
 Below are the first sutras of major philosophies which broadly introduce the subject matter of that philosophy- vedon main jo aadhaar tatva beej rup main bikhare dikhaai padate the, ve brahmanon main aakar kuch ubhare; parantu vahaan karmkand kii lataaon ke pratanon main fasakar bahut adhik nahin bad paye
 These sprouted in the Aranyakas and thrived in the Upanishads
 darshanon kaa vikaas jo hamen upanishdon main hamen drushtigochar hota he, aalochakon ne uskaa shriganesh lagbhag dau sau varsh isa purv sthir kiya he
 It is ancient from Mahatma Buddha
 itnaa hi nahin vidwaanon ne sankhya, yoga or mimasaa ko bhi buddha se pracheen mana he
 It is possible that these philosophies may not have existed at that time, although they were present in some form
 vaisheshikdarshan bhi shaayad buddha se pracheen hi he; kyonki jaisaa aaj ke yug main nyaay or vaisheshik samaan tantra samajhe jate hai, usee prakaar pehle purv mimance or vaisheshik samajhe jate the
 The emergence of Buddhist philosophy is believed to be two hundred years before Christ, but Jain philosophy is also ancient than Buddhist philosophy
 isaki pushti main yah pramaan diya jaataa he ki pracheen jain darshanon main na to buddha darshan or na kisi hindu darshan kaa hi khandan uplabdh hota he
 Mahavir Swami, who is considered the originator of Jainism, was also ancient to Buddha
 atev jain darshan kaa buddha darshan se pracheen hona yuktiyukt anumaan he
 The historical sequence of Indian philosophies is difficult to determine
 in sab bhinn-bhinn darshanon kaa lagbhag saath hi saath samaan rup se pradurbhaav evam vikaas hua he
 Many links have broken up here and there
 at: jo kuch shesh he, usee kaa aadhaar lekar chalanaa he
 In this sequence, even if there is no pure historicity, the series of gradual development has continued from beginning to end
 isliye praayah vidwaanon ne isi kram kaa anusaran kiya he
 Indian philosophy begins with the Vedas
 "veda" bhartiya dharm, darshan, samskruti, sahitya aadi sabhi ke mul strot hai
 Even today Veda-mantras are sung on the occasion of religious and cultural acts
 anek darshan-sampradaay vedon ko apana aadhaar or pramaan maanate hai
 In the modern sense, we cannot call Vedas texts of philosophy
 ve pracheen bharatvasiyon ke sangitamay kavy ke sankalan he
 They include many topics of Indian life of that time
 vedon ke in geeton main anek prakaar ke darshanik vichaar bhi milte hai
 It is from these seeds of contemplation that the Vanarajis of later philosophies have developed
 adhikansh bhartiya darshan vedon ko apana adistrot maanate hai
 These are called "theistic philosophies"
 prasiddh shaddarshan inhen ke antargat hai
 The philosophies which consider themselves independent of the Vedic tradition are also influenced to some extent by the Vedic ideologies
 vedon kaa rachanakaal bahut vivadagrast he
 Western scholars often composed the Rigveda around 1500 BC
 From 2500 BC Till is considered
 iske vipareet bhartiya vidvan jyotish aadi ke pramaanon dwaara rugveda kaa samay 3000 i
pus
 se lekar 75000 varsh i
pus
 tak maanate hai
 It is difficult to estimate the time of these ancient creations based on the known motions of history
 pracheen kaal main itane vishaal or samrudh sahitya ke vikaas main hajaaron varsh lage honge, isamen koi andeh nahin
 The available Vedic literature is a small fraction of the entire Vedic literature
 pracheen yug main rachit samast sahitya sankalit bhi nahin ho sakaa hoga or sankalit sahitya kaa bahut sa bhaag akramanakariyon ne nasht kar diya hoga
 The actual Vedic literature was so vast that it is difficult to imagine its creation
 nihsandeh vah bahut pracheen rahaa hoga
 In connection with the Vedas, it is necessary to clarify that "vedas", like the Quran and the Bible, are not the name of a single book, nor are they creations of any one human being
 "veda" ek sampurna sahitya he jisaki vishaal parampara he or jisamen anek granth sammilit hai
 In the religious tradition, the Vedas are considered to be eternal, unconquerable and divine
 aitihaasik drushtikon se ham unhen rishiyon kii rachana maan sakate hai
 The sages who created the Vedamantras are many
 vaidic sahitya kaa vikaas chaar charnon main hua he
 These Samhita are called Brahmins, Aranyakas and Upanishads
 mantron or stutiyon ke sangrah ko "samhita" kehete hai
 The Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda are the codes of mantras
 inaki bhi anek shakhaayen hai
 The mantras of these Samhita were sung to praise the gods on the occasion of Yajna
 aaj bhi dharmik or saanskrithik krityon ke avasar par inkaa gayan hota he
 The musical hymns of the gods Indra, Agni, Varuna, Surya, Som, Usha etc
 are safe in these Vedamantras
 yajna or devopasana hi vaidic dharm kaa mul rup tha
 The spirit of the Vedas is not sanyasapradhan as in the later philosophies
 vedamantron main jivan ke prati aasthaa tathaa jivan kaa ullas otprot he
 The untruth of the world is not known in the Vedantras
 rugveda main loukik mulyon kaa paryaapt maan he
 Vedic sages pray for food, wealth, children, health, longevity, victory etc
 from the gods
 vedon ke mantra pracheen bharatiyon ke sangitamay lokkavy ke uttam udhaaharan hai
 The prose is predominant in the Brahmin, Aranyaka and Upanishadic texts, though their prose is also rhythmic
 brahman granthon main yagyon kii vidhi, unke prayojan, fal aadi kaa vivechan he
 In the Aranyakantha texts, there is an inclination towards spirituality
 jaisaa ki is naam se hi vidit hota he, ye vanprasthon ke upyog ke granth hai
 The Upanishads are dominated by spiritual thought
 chaaron vedon kii mantrasamhitaon ke brahman, aaranyak or upanishad alag alag milte hai
 Brahmins like Shatapath, Tanday etc
 are famous and important
 aitarey, taittiriya aadi ke naam se aaranyak or upanishad donon milte hai
 Apart from these, ancient Upanishads like Ish, Cane, Kath, Saiv, Mundak, Mandukya etc
 are the archetypes of Indian thought
 upanishdon kaa darshan aadhyatmik he
 The main goal of Upanishads is the cultivation of Brahma
 brahm ko aatma bhi kehete hai
 The "soul" is an indescribable and imperceptible element beyond all the permeable elements of the subject, body, senses, mind, intellect, etc
, which is chitsurapa, infinite and blissful
 sabhi parichchhedon se pare hone ke kaaran vah anant he
 Being uncooperative and one, the soul can form the basis of inner impulse and non-monopoly among humans in the discriminating world
 aatma hi manushya kaa vaastavik swaroop he
 By interviewing him, man becomes free from all the shackles of mind
 advaitabhaav kii purnataa ke liye aatma athwa brahm se jad jagat kii utpatti kaise hoti he, isaki vyakhya ke liye maaya kii anirvachaneey shakti kii kalpana kii gai he
 But spiritual advaitaabha is more important aspect of Vedanta of Upanishads than creationism
 yahi advaitabhaav bhartiya samskruti main otprot he
 This Brahmanism of the Upanishads in the field of philosophy became the basis of the later Vedanta views of Adi Shankara, Ramanujacharya etc
 vedon kaa antim bhaag hone ke kaaran upanishdon ko "vedant" bhi kehete hai
 The opinion of the Upanishads became the basis of Vedanta doctrine and sects later
 upanishdon kii style saral or gambhir he
 Serious elements of experience are expressed in Upanishads in a very simple language
 unako samajhane ke liye anubhav kaa prakaash apekshit he
 Experience of Brahm is the goal of Upanishads
 vah apni sadhana se hi praapt hota he
 Contact with the Guru is more helpful in that
 tap, aachaar aadi sadhana kii bhoomika banaate hai
 Karma is not a seeker of spiritual experience
 karm pradhan vaidic dharm se upanishdon kaa yah matbhed he
 Sannyas, asceticism, yoga, penance, renunciation etc
 have been given great importance in the Upanishads
 inamen shraman parampara ke kathor sanyasawad kii prerana kaa strot dikhaai detaa he
 Tapoist Jainism and Buddhism and Gita's Karmayoga have sprouted in the spiritual land of the Upanishads
 hindu dharm main darshan atyant pracheen parampara rahi he
 In Vedic philosophies, conspiracy is more famous and ancient
 gita kaa karmwaad bhi inke samakaleen he
 The conspiracies are called 'theistic philosophy'
 ve veda kii satta ko maanate hai
 Apart from various types of theistic philosophies in the Hindu philosophical tradition, atheistic and materialistic philosophical traditions have also existed
 maharishi gautam rachit is darshan main padaarthon ke tatvagyan se moksh prapti kaa varnan he
 The philosophy of substances leads to the elimination of false knowledge
 phir ashubh karmo main pravrutt na hona, moh se mukti evam dukhon se nivritti hoti he
 In this, God has been considered as the creator, formless, omnipresent and individual soul apart from the body and nature is unconscious and the cause of creation of the universe and it clearly depicts trivialism
 iske alaava isamen nyaay kii paribhaasha ke anusaar nyaay karne kii paddati tathaa usamen jai-paraajay ke kaarnon kaa spasht nirdesh diya gaya he
 This philosophy composed by Maharishi Kanad describes the true nature of religion
 isamen sansaarik unnati tathaa nishshrey siddhi ke saadhan ko dharm mana gaya he
 Therefore, performing rituals of religion is essential for human welfare
 is darshan main dravya, gun, karm, saamaanya, vishesh or samavaay in chha: padaathon ke sadharmy tathaa vaidharmy ke tatvadhan se moksh prapti maani jaati he
 Religion and lawfulness is a special method of knowledge, without which it is not possible to solve the misconceptions
 iske anusaar chaar pair hone se gaay-bhens ek nahin ho sakate
 Similarly, both Jiva and Brahm are conscious
 kintu is sadharmy se donon ek nahin ho sakate
 Also, this philosophy considers the Vedas to be the ultimate proof of being divine
 is darshan ke rachayita maharishi kapil hai
 In this, nature has been considered as the causal cause of creation on the basis of hospitality
 iskaa pramukh siddhant he ki abhaav se bhav yaa asat se sat kii utpatti kadaapi sambhav nahin he
 Truth works can be generated only due to truth
 sankhya darshan prakruti se sristi rachana or sanhaar ke kram ko vishesh rup se maanata he
 Along with this, the ultimate subtle cause of nature and its 24 functional substances are described clearly
 purush 25 waan tatv mana gaya he, jo prakruti kaa vikaar nahin he
 Thus, nature is the cause of all activities, but there is no reason for nature, because it has eternal power
 purush chetan tatv he, to prakruti achetan
 Man is the bhakti of nature, while nature itself is not the bhokti
 is darshan ke rachayita maharishi patanjali hai
 In it, God, Jeevatma and Prakriti are clearly described
 iske alaava yoga kya he, jeev ke bandhan kaa kaaran kya he? chitt kii vrittiyaan koun si hai? iske niyantran ke kya upaay hai ityadi yogic kriyaaon kaa vistrut varnan kiya gaya he
 According to this theory, the meditation of God is internal
 jab tak hamaari indriyaan bahirgami hai, tab tak dhyaan kadaapi sambhav nahin he
 According to this, the praise and worship of God with other names is incomplete without chanting the main name of God O3M
 mimasaasutra is darshan kaa mul granth he jiske rachayita maharishi jaimini hai
 This philosophy describes the appropriation of mantras in Vedic yajnas and the procedures of yagyas
 yadi yoga darshan antahkaran shuddhi kaa upaay bataata he, to mimasaa darshan maanav ke paariwarik jivan se rashtriya jivan tak ke kartavyon or akartavyon kaa varnan karata he, jisase samast raashtra kii unnati ho sake
 Just as the entire ritual is based on the appropriation of mantras, the Mimamsa philosophy also supports the appropriation of mantras and its legislation
 dharm ke liye maharishi jaimini ne veda ko bhi param pramaan mana he
 According to him, the appropriation of mantras, shruti, sentence, case, place and Samakhya are considered as the fundamental basis in Yajna
 vedant kaa arth he vedon kaa antim siddhant
 The Brahmasutra composed by Maharishi Vyasa is the basic text of this philosophy
 is darshan ko uttar mimasaa bhi kehete hai
 According to this philosophy, being the doer-bearer and exterminator of the universe is the reason for the world
 upadan athwa abhinn kaaran nahin
 Brahma is omnipotent, omnipotent, blissful, eternal, eternal, eternal
 saath hi janm maran aadi cleshon se rahit or niraakaar bhi he
 It is clear from the first formula of this philosophy, that is, Brahma curiosity, that what one wants to know is different from Brahm, otherwise how can there be a desire to know oneself
 or yah sarvavidit he ki jeevatma hameshaa se hi apane dukhon se mukti kaa upaay karti rahi he
 But the quality of Brahma is different from this
 aage chalakar veydant ke anekanek sampradaay bane
 Apart from conspiracy philosophies, Lokayat and Shaiva and Shakta philosophy are also integral parts of Hindu philosophy
 vedavirohi hone ke kaaran naastik sampradaayon main charvak mat kaa bhi naam liya jaataa he
 Due to being materialistic, it could not get respect
 iskaa itihaas or sahitya bhi uplabdh nahin he
 Excerpts from a Charvaka text by the name of "jupiter Sutra" are found in other philosophy texts
 charvak mat ek prakaar kaa yatharthwaad or bhautikwaad he
 According to this, there is only direct evidence
 anumaan or aagam sandigdh hote hai
 Only the physical world dependent on direct is true
 aatma, ishwar, swarg aadi sab kalpit hai
 Consciousness arises in the body due to the combination of ghosts
 deh ke saath maran main uskaa ant ho jaataa he
 The soul is not eternal
