 Razia of Turkish origin was practiced in the leadership and administration of the army like other Muslim princesses, so that it could be used when needed
 
 razia sultanaa muslim evam turki itihaas ki pehali mahila shaasha thim
 Razia was made the Sultan of Delhi after the death of his father Shams-ud-din Iltutmish
 iltutamish, pehla aisa shaasha tha, jisane apane baad kisi mahila ko uttaradhikari niyukt kiya
 However, it was not acceptable for the Muslim class to inherit a woman from Iltutmish, so after his death his younger son Raknuddin Firoz Shah was placed on the throne
 raknuddin, kaa shashan bahut hi kam samay ke liye tha, iltutamish kii vidhwaa, shah turkan kaa shashan par niyantran nahin rah gaya tha
 The public outraged against the lax and reckless Raknuddin to the extent that Raknuddin and his mother, Shah Turkan, were assassinated on 9 November 1236
 uskaa shashan maatr chah maah kaa tha
 After this, in the absence of any other option for the Sultan, the Muslims had to give the reins of governance to a woman
 
 And Razia Sultan became the ruler of Delhi
 shashan kaaryon main razia kii ruchi apane pita ke shashan ke samay se hi thi
 After assuming the throne, Razia preferred to wear a soldier's coat and turban like men, unlike customs

 Razia did not pay enough attention to it
 , kintu uskaa is sambandh ke parinaam ko kam aankna apane rajya ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 According to some sources, Razia and Yakut were lovers; According to other sources, they were both close friends / confidants

 The Governor of Bathinda, Mallik ikhtiar-ud-din-altunia, revolted along with the other provincial governors, who were ruled by the ruler of Razia
 razia or altuniya ke bich yuddh hua jisamen yakut maaraa gaya or razia ko bandi bana liya gaya

 The tomb of Razia Sultan and her lover Yakut, the only female ruler to rule the throne of Delhi, is claimed at three different places
 razia kii majaar ko lekar itihaaskaar ek mat nahin he
 Delhi, Kaithal and Tonk have been claiming their claim on the tomb of Razia Sultana
 lekin vaastavik majaar par abhi faisla nahin ho paaya he
 By the way, these three claims are the strongest among the claims of Razia's tomb
 in sabhi sthanon par sthit majaaron par arabi farsi main razia sultan likhe hone ke sanket to mili hai lekin thos pramaan nahin mil sake hai
 Some concrete evidence of the tomb of Razia Sultan and his Ethiopian slave Yakut has been found in Tonk, Rajasthan
 yahaan puraane kabistan ke paas ek vishaal majaar mili he jisapar farsi main ’saltane hind rajiyah’ ukera gaya he
 There is also a small tomb nearby which can be Yakut's tomb
 apni bhavyata or vishalata ke aakaar par ise sultanaa kii majaar qaraar diya gaya he
 Local historian says that there was a gap of one month between Jung and Razia's death from Bahram
 itihaaskaar is ek maah ko chook vash ullekith nahin kar paae or jang ke turant baad uski maut maan lee gai
 Whereas it was not so
 jang main haar ko saamne dekh yakuut razia ko lekar raajapootaana kii taraf nikal gaya
 He wanted to save Razia's life but eventually he was surrounded in Tonk and died here

 Mr
 Clifton concluded that "swabhaav mudda nahin he or na hi yah praasangik he
 The issue that is relevant is the risk of sum insured
 If the behavior of any other dog worsens, it bites someone, but it would have been so bad that the person would die or become crippled for life and the risk of the sum insured is also the same
 
 par yadi pit bul terrior kaa vyavhaar bigadataa he, to praayah hi koi maaraa jaataa he yaan aapng ho jaataa he- or is kaaran ab bimit raashi kaa jokhim atyadhik ho gaya he, jiske liye kute or unke shikaar, donon ko hi keemat chukaani pad rahi he
 " nimnaankit saarini sanyukt rajya main 2005 se 2009 ke bich samachar sansthaaon dwaara darj kiye gaye pit bul-sambandhit ghaatak maamalon ko sankshipt rup main prastut karti he: Many jurisdictions have introduced breed-specific laws, and some governmental organizations, such as the United States Army and the Marine Corps, have also taken administrative actions as a result of the more publicized cases related to Pit Bull-type dogs
 in kaarywahiyon main pit bul-prakaar ke kutton ko rakhane par pratyaksh pratibandh se lekar pit bul ke swaamitv par niyam or pratibandh aadi shaamil hai or praayah isamen ek kanoonee purvadharna bhi hoti he ki pit bul-prakaar kaa kutta prathamdrishtya ek kanoonee rup se "khatarnaak" yaa "dusht" kutta he
 In response, some state governments in the United States have prohibited or prohibited the right of the municipality to promulgate breed-based laws within that state, although these race-specific laws prohibit military units located in that state
 There will be no effect
 ab aam taur par kanoonee maamalon main yah maanya he ki sanyukt rajya or canada main nyaayadhikaar ke antargat unke paas nasl vishesh par aadhaarit kanoon pravartit karne kaa adhikaar he; haalanki, kutton dwaara kaate jane vaale maamalon ko rokane ke liye nasl vishesh par aadhaarit kanoon kii prabhavakaarita par abhi bhi vivaad he
 One approach is that pit bull dogs are a public safety issue that vindicates the following actions, such as restrictions on ownership, mandating ovulation / impotence, microchipping and liability insurance for all pit bull dogs, or Prohibition of those who are guilty of any crime over the ownership of pit bulls
 doosraa drushtikon yah he ki ek vyapak "kutta kaatane sambandhi" kanoon jisame ki parishkrut upabhokta shiksha or kanoonee rup se paaltu jaanavar ko jimmedaripurvak rakhane ke abhyaas kii anivaaryta bhi shaamil ho, vah khatarnaak kutton kii is samasya ke liye, kisi nasl aadhaarit kaanoon pravartan kii tulana main ek acha upaay hoga
 The third view is that race-specific laws cannot prohibit the breed altogether, but they must strictly regulate the conditions under which only certain breeds can be empowered, for example, certain classes Restricting individuals from getting their rights, declaring public areas where those dogs are prohibited Will be made and such conditions as, eg, wearing of anti-dogs by dogs when taking certain breed of dogs to public places, etc
 Finally, some governments, such as Australia, have banned rectangles of certain breeds and mandated ovulation / impotence of all existing dogs in a natural attrition effort to gradually eliminate the population of these breeds

 Generally, dog owners are held responsible when they have been negligent in handling or restraining their dog, or when they already know that their dog is prone to injuring people
 is; However, dog owners are directly responsible for such incidents if the local law considers the owner to be solely responsible for the damage done by the dog, knowing here or not about the negligence or tendency of the dog
 Does not matter Homeowners 'and tenants' insurance policies have insurance coverage ranging from $ 100,000 to $ 300,000, particularly in cases of dogs being injured; However, some insurance companies prohibit dogs whose owners they have insured in cases of dogs being bitten, in pratibandhon main kute dwaara kaate jane ke maamalon ko beemaa policy main shaamil naa karnaa; kuch khaas naslon ke kute rakhane vaale swaamiyon kii beemaa dar main vruddhi; kuch khaas naslon ke maalikon ke liye vishesh prashikshan kii anivaaryta yaa unak dwaara apane kutton ko america canal club canin good citision test main uteern hone kii anivaaryta; kute ke maalik dwaara apane kute ko mukhrodhani, zanjeer yaa gheraav main pratibandhit rakhane kii anivaaryta or kuch khaas naslon ko rakhane vaale grihaswamiyon or kiraayedaaron ke sambandh main policy likhane se inkaar aadi sammilit hai
 In Ohio, which has declared all Pit Bull-type dogs to be "dangerous," special liability insurance that limits the damage caused by Pit Bull-type dogs may cost more than $ 575 per year

 agnashay sthit islands of langerhands agnyashay kaa keval ek pratishat bhaag hi hota he
 a normal pancreas consists of more than one million islands and each island has 80–100 beta cells
 ye koshikaayen prati 10 sacand main 2 milligram pratishat kii dar se blad glucose ko naapti rahati hai
 In one or one and a half minutes, beta cells provide the amount of insulin needed to maintain blood sugar levels normal
 jab madhumeh nahi hoti he to rakt-sharkara ke str ko atyadhik upar uthaanaa lagbhag asambhav rahata he
 Hence the supply of insulin is almost never exhausted
 iske alaava agnyashay main alpha naamak koshikaayen bhi hoti hai jo glucagon naamak tatv nirmit karti hai

 Results from recent DCCT trials and UK PD tests in the world have shown that it is imperative for diabetics to maintain their blood sugar levels accurately
 is prakaar tip-2 ke rogiyon ko bhi antatah thodaa-bahut insulin kii aavashyaktaa to hoti hi he
 It is also not necessary that once you start taking insulin, you will have to take insulin for life
 yah bhi sambhav he, ki kuch din hi insulin lene par laab ho or baad main dawaaiyon se kaam chal jaye
 Insulin also has many side effects: the fear of weight gain, the state of insulin habitat, the fear of clotting by the insulin, the fear of the blood sugar being reduced more than the insulin required, etc
