 But the reality is that under-intelligence is the result of less mental development than normal and limited intelligence produced by unknown causes from birth
 anya sab prakaar kii alpbuddhita ko gaun maansik nunata kahana chahie
 In the Binet test an individual's ability is seen and an estimate is made for how old a child is
 isko us vyakti kii maansik aayu kehete hai
 For example, if a child cannot eat hygienically with his hand due to under-age, even if the body parts are healthy, then his mental age can be considered as four years
 yadi us vyakti kii saadhaaran aayu 16 varsh he to uskaa buddhi gunank 4 / 16v100, arthath 25, mana jayega
 On the basis of this coefficient, the intelligibility is divided into three classes

 Others have to be cared for by the less intelligent and they have to be fed

 Except for the simplest things, they are unable to remember things or learn virtue
 parantu yah sambhav he ki ve swayanchalit yantra kii tarah, bina samajhe, sikhaaya gaya kaary karte rahen
 Sometimes they can remember some dates or events, but whatever they learn in one way or the other, they are not able to use it properly
 nunebuddhiwaalon kaa vyaktitv vividh hota he; kuch dayavan or aagyaakaari hote hai; duusare krur, dhokheybaaj or kunhi 
 More than these, people with less intelligence are often stubborn, quick cheaters, and pleasant
 ve sheeghra hi samajdrohi margon main utar padate hai; jaise veshyavriti, chori, dakaiti or baari aparaadh
 They can even commit murder without realizing the importance of crime
 durbal buddhivaale, jinhen angreji main moran bhi kehete hai, vishesh shiksha se itnaa sikh sakate hai ki yantravat shram dwaara ve apana jivicoparjan kar saken
 Such individuals must be encouraged to earn a living
 kheti, bartan aadi maanjane kii naukari or mazdooree aadi kaa kaam ve kar sakate hai
 Some such people manage to wash glass utensils and clean the table in the laboratory

 Often they start speaking late; Bid is not clear and euphemism is also not good
 aise bacchon ko vishesh paathshaalaon main shiksha di jaae to acha he
 Their career is underdeveloped, but it is not extraordinary for women to adopt prostitution of ill-informed people
 durbalabuddhivaali mata nirday hoti he, bacchon kii thik dekhbhaal nahin karti or gruhasthi bhi thik se nahin chalaati, jisase grihasth jivan du:khamay ho jaataa he
 Often weak-minded boys form a separate group and commit robbery or commit a crime, for example, if there is anger towards the owner, he may set fire to his house

 These people commit crimes without realizing what the result will be
 aise bhi log hai jo paathshaala main mandabuddhi samajhe jate the, parantu peeche apane hi praytn se unchi sthitiyon main pahunche hai
 There are also certain types of intellectuals that have mental impairments along with mental errors, such as moribund stupidity, cretinism, difficulty, etc
 alpbuddhivaale bacchon kii dekhbhaal saadhaaran paathshaalas nahin kar saktin or unamem aise bacchon ko bharti karnaa or unako kisi na kisi prakaar paas karaane kii cheshtaa karnaa bhul he
 In some countries such as the United States, there are separate settlements of children of poor and ill-conditioned care, where special care is taken of them and special training is given for the purpose of developing them as far as possible

 yah anukoolneey avchetan, udaahranarth visheshgy nirnay main or isaki kathinaaiyon jaise roodhiwaadita, donon kii shaktiyon par vichaar karata he
 The author describes the basic theme of this book as "thin slicing": our ability to measure, which is really important to us from the very close of experience
 anya shabdon main, yah ek kalpana he ki swat:sfurt nirnay praaia: - saavdhaneepurvak yojana banaae gaye or vichaar kiye gaye - se acha yaa behatar hota he
 Gladwell offers examples from science, advertising, sales, medicine, and popular music to bolster his ideas
 gladwell patala tukdaa karne kii kriya ke saath logon ke niyamit anubhavon ke kai udaahranon ko prastut karte hai
 Gladwell explains how the merits of an expert's "thin piece" can be tempered by their likes and dislikes, prejudices and stereotypes, and how they can be filled with more information
 avchetan purvaagrah ke do vishesh praaroop jinaki charchaa gladwell karte hai, ve hai antarnihit association test or manovaigyanik swatchta

 gladwell kehete hai ki vah atibhaarit soochna kaa yug he, vah pate hai ki visheshgy praaia: kai vishleshanon ko karne kii tulana main twarit nirnyon ke saath behatar nirnay lete hai
 Gladwell cites an example of a wide range of thin slicing gambles in terms of speed dating tennis, sports of military wars, cinema, faux suites, popular music, and future divorces
 gladwell yah bhi varnan karte hai ki kabhi kabhi adhik soochna nirnay kii aavruti yaa doctor ke nidaan main bhi ho sakati he

 The collection of information is commonly interpreted as a confirmation of a person's initial belief or maliciousness
 gladwell spasht karte hai ki behatar nirnay adhik saamaanya dharna ki kisi rogi ke bare main vyapak jaankaree sudhaare gaye nidaan ke anupaatik he ke bajaay saralata or jaankaree ke ke dwaara zyaadaatar nishpadit kiya ja saktaa he
 If the big picture is more clear to take decision then make the decision with the big picture without the use of microscope

 Gladwell uses the 1999 assassination of Emadou Diallo as a quick spontaneous decision where an innocent man with four policemen from New York shoots 41 bullets at the door of his house can have devastating effects

 If this treatise could be prepared according to the objective in its proper form, then it would present a eulogy example; But due to the prevailing longevity in Hindi writers and the tendency of lack of readiness in organizational and collective work, this work could not be completed in standard form due to lack of required support from many suitable scholars

 nautrophil aamtaur par sanchaarit shwet rakt koshikaon kaa 50-70% hissaa banaate hai or rudhir main upasthit bacteria ko nasht karke sankraman ke khilaaf sharir ke praathmik rog pratirohak ke rup main kaam karte hai
 Therefore, patients with neutropenia are more susceptible to bacterial infections and the disease can be fatal if they do not get immediate medical attention
 beemaari kii avadhi ke aadhaar par neutropania gambhir athwa dirghakaalik ho saktaa he
 If this condition persists for more than 3 months, the patient is considered to be suffering from chronic neutropenia
 kabhi-kabhi ise leucopania shabd ke sthaan par bhi prayukt kiya jaataa he, kyonki nautrophil sarvaadhik maatra main paae jane vaale leukosite hote hai, parantu neutropania ko leucopania kaa ek upvarg maananaa adhik uchit rahegaa
 Neutropenia can have many factors that can be broadly divided into two parts, problems in the production of cells by the bone marrow or the destruction of cells in other parts of the body
 Treatment depends on the nature of the factor and emphasis is placed on preventing and treating the infection during treatment
 prati microlitre rudhir main sampoorn nautrophil gananaa ke aadhaar par neutropania kii gambhirtha ko vargeekrut karne ke liye teen saamaanya disha-nirdeshon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he: It is possible that neutropenia may not be detected, but usually it is caught when a patient has severe infection or sepsis
 neutropania ke rogiyon main kuch saamaanya sankraman apratyaashit rup dhaaran kar sakate hai; udhaaharan ke liye, mawaad kaa bananaa ullekhneey rup se anupasthit ho saktaa he, kyonki iske liye nautrophil granulosite ke sancharan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Common symptoms of neutropenia include fever and frequent infections
 ye sankraman munh ke ulcer, dast, peshaab karte samay jalan, ghaav ke aas paas asaamaanya laalimaa, dard or sujan, athwa gale kii kharash jaisi sthitiyaan utpann kar sakate hai
 a low neutrophil count is detected only when there is a total blood count
 aam taur par, sahi nidaan tak pahunchne ke liye anya pareekshanon kii bhi aavashyaktaa padati he
 When diagnosis is uncertain, or serious factors are likely, bone marrow biopsy is often necessary
 anya pareekshan jinhen aam taur par kiya jaataa he, ve hai: yadi chakree neutropania kaa andeh hota he to kramik nautrophil gananaa, antineutrophil pratirakshi ke liye jaanch, autoantibody screen or systemic lupas erithematosus, vitamin bi12 or folate assej ke liye jaanch or aesidyphid serum pareekshan
 The factors can be divided into the following groups: viral sankraman ke dauraan aksar halkaa neutropania ho saktaa he
 Additionally, there is a condition called morning pseudonutropenia that probably arises due to the side effects of some antidepressants
 neutropania ke liye koi adarsh upachaar nahin he, parantu ricombinent ji-siesuef chemotherapy ke rogiyon or neutropania ke janmajaat prakaaron se grast rogiyon main prabhavi ho saktaa he
 The association between low neutrophil counts and increased risk of infection was first demonstrated in patients with leukemia

 The Punjab problem began in the 1970s as a drag on Akali politics and the Punjab demands of the Akalis
 1973 or 1978 i
 main akali dal ne anandpur sahib prastaav paarit kiya
 In the original proposal, it was suggested that the central government of India should have authority only on defense, foreign policy, communication and currency, while states should have full rights on other subjects
 They wanted autonomy in the northern region of India
 unki maang thi ki- chandigarh keval punjab kii hi rajdhani ho, punjabi bhashi kshetra punjab main shaamil kiye jaaen, nadiyon ke pani ke mudde par sarvocch nyaayalay kii raay lee jaae, 'naharon ke hedworks' or pen-bijli banane ke moolbhoot dhaanche kaa prabandhan punjab ke paas ho, fuj main bhartee kaabiliyat ke aadhaar par ho or isamen sikhon kii bhartee par lagi kathith seemaa hataai jaae, tathaa akhil bhartiya gurudwara kaanoon banaaya jaae

 The global system theory is a system theory for understanding world history and social change
 iskaa maananaa he ki saamaajik adhyayan ke liye puure vishwa ko mul ikai mana janaa chahie na ki deshon yaa rajyon ko
 The world is divided into nation-states, but scholars who seek to see it as a global system try to understand this division in terms of unity
 unki manyata he ki saamaajik simaaon or saamaajik nirnay-prakriya kaa adhyayan karne ke liye raashtra-rajyon ko ek ikai ke rup main grahan karne ke bajaay vaishvik pranali ko vishleshan kaa aadhaar banaaya janaa chahie
 Formulation based on this intellectual project is known as 'global system theory'
 iskaa vikaas pachaas ke dashak main pratipaadit nirbharta-siddhant kii radical prasthaapanaaon or itihaas-lekhan ke francisi anal skool se prabhavit he
 The main father of world-system Theory is Emanuel Wallerstein
 wallrstine or vaishvik pranali ke anya siddhantkaar maanate hai ki vishwa kii poonjeewaadi arthvyavastha chaar buniyadi antarvirodhon se grast he jinke kaaran uskaa ant avashwayambhavi he, bhale hi sheet-yuddh ke khatme or soviet sangh keparabhav ke kaaran filhal sari duniya main uskaa bolbalaa ho gaya ho
 The first of these contradictions is the persistent imbalance between supply and demand
 yah asantulan tab tak jari rahegaa jab tak utpaadan sambandhi nirnay farm ke str par liye jate rahenge
 The second is the tendency of capitalists to view a part of the surplus value generated by consumption as their profit
 adhishesh ko or bade paimaane par paidaa karne ke liye aage chal kar maujuuda adhishesh kaa punarvitaran karnaa hoga
 The third contradiction relates to the capabilities of the state as to how long the state institution will continue to gain the support of the workers to uphold the legitimacy of capitalism
 chauthaa antarvirodh ek vaishvik pranali or anginat rajyon ke bich he
 The co-existence of these two has expanded the system, but at the same time the chances of better mutual cooperation necessary to deal with systemic crises have also been reduced
 vishwa poonjeewaadi arthvyavastha ke prati aalochanatmak ravaiya rakhane vaale ye vidwaan is pranali ko ek aitihaasik vyavastha ke taur par dekhte hai jisaki sanrachanaayen uske bheetar maujuud kisi bhi raajnneetik ikai ke mukaable bhinn str par kaam karti hai
 Wallerstein considered the origin of the contemporary global system between 1450 and 1670
 is avadhi ko ve ‘di long sickstinth centuri’ kii sangya dete hai
 Earlier Western Europe was in the feudal period and economic production was almost entirely dependent on agricultural yields
 wallrstine ke mutabik 1300 ke baad ek taraf to khetihar utpaadan main tej giravat hui or duusari ore europee jalwaayu ke kaaran kisaan aabaadi ke bich pehle se kahin zyaada mahamariyaan failane lageen
 In the sixteenth century itself, Europe grew towards the establishment of the capitalist world-economy
 samantvaad ke tahat utpaadan utpaadakon ke apane upbhog ke liye hota tha, par nayi pranali main utpaadan kaa makasad bazaar main vinimay ho gaya
 Due to the market-based economy, the income of the producers fell below the value of their production and the infinite accumulation of material goods became the driving force of capitalism
 naye yug main aarthik vruddhi kii prakriya bazaar ke daayre ko bhugolic vistaar kii taraf le gayi, shram par niyantran ke vibhinn rup viksit hue or europe main taqatvar rajyon kaa udai hua
 The new economy that was created was different from the existing system in two ways
 vah samrajyon kii seemaa se pare jate hue ek se adhik raajnneetik prabhutv-kendron ke saath bani rah sakati thi or uskaa pramukh lakshan tha centre or paridhi ke bich shram kaa ekmaatr antarrashtriya vibhaajan
 Theorists of the global system believe that the countries that benefited the most from this change, they created its center
 shuru main uttar-pashchimi europe ke frans, england or holland jaise deshon ne yah bhoomika nibhaai
 The region was characterized by strong central governments and large mercenaries deployed under their control
 kendriya satta se sampann in sarkaron kii madad se poonjipati varg ko antarrashtriya vyapaar ke sutara apane haath main lene kaa mauka mila or vah isse aarthik adhishesh khinchne laga
 As the factory-based construction in the cities increased, a large number of landless farmers started moving towards the cities
 duusari taraf krishi sambandhi praudyogiki main hue vikaas ke kaaran kheti kii paidaavaar bhi badhati gayi
 The area at the center of the global system was concentrated in capital
 bainkon, vibhinn vyavsaayon, vyapaar or kaarkaanaa aadhaarit kushal utpaadan ke vistaar ne mazaduri aadhaarit shram par aadhaarit arthvyavastha ke jari rahane kii paristhitiyaan paidaa kin
 On the other hand, there were regions of the periphery that theorists of the global system recognized that the states in them did not have strong central governments, and instead of relying on wage-based labor, they combined their production on the basis of compulsory labor
 paridhi main sthit ye kshetra centre sthit rajyon ko kaccha maal supplai karke apni arthvyavasthaayen chalaate the
 In the sixteenth century, the main regions of the periphery were considered in Latin America and Eastern Europe
 laathini america main spani or portugeez shashan ke kaaran sthaneey netritv nasht ho gaya tha or unki jagah kamazor naukarshahiyaan europee niyantran ke tahat kaam kar rahi thim
 The native population was completely under slavery
 africa se ghulaamon kaa aayaat karke kheti or khanan kaa kaam karavaaya jaataa tha
 The local oligarchy was sixty-knot with foreign owners
 europee takaton kaa makasad aise maal kaa utpaadan karnaa tha jiskaa upbhog unke grih-rajyon main ho sake
 Theorists of the global system also identified a third region of the semi-periphery that was playing the role of a buffer between the center and the periphery
 ardh-paridhi ke kshetra centre vaale ilaakon main bhi ho sakate the or unka taalluk ateet kii samrudh arthvyavasthaaon se bhi ho saktaa tha
 But during the sixteenth century they were going through a period of relatively decline
 centrestha rajya unka shoshan karte the or unke dwaara badale main paridhi vaale kshetron kaa dohan kiya ja rahaa tha
 Wallerstein and his followers explain the evolution of the global system from the Sohalenth to the twenty-first centuries in two stages: the first phase lasted until the eighteenth century
 is dauraan european rajya or taqatvar hue
 Trade from Asia and America led to a small proportion of rich and influential businessmen at the expense of laborers
 rajshahiyon kii takat badi or sarvasattavadi rajya ne apana jhanda gaad diya
 After the expulsion of the minorities, especially the Jews, and the expulsion of Europe, the population of Europe grew towards homogenization
 duusare charan ke tahat attharahavin sadi main udyogikaran ne khetihar utpaadan kii jagah leni shuru kii
 European states started searching for new markets
 agle do sau saal tak aadhunik vishwa-pranali main asia or africa jaise naye-naye kshetron ko shaamil karne kii prakriya jari rahi
 As a result, the economic surplus increased
 beesvin sadi ke shuruaati dashakon main is vaishvik pranali kaa charitra vastav main bhoomandaleey bana

 kritrim viryasechan Intrauterine insemination garbhadhaaran karaane ke uddeshy se maithun ke bajaay anya tareeke se maadaa ke garbhashay main nar kaa shukranu pahunchaana hota he
 In humans this work is mainly used as a treatment of sterility while in cow-buffalo and other animals it is used as a general method of reproduction
 striyon main kritrim viryasechan kii kai takneekein hai- Intra Uterine Insemination Technique In simple words, the childless couple can also get children through artificial insemination process
 banjhapan kii sthiti ke liye purushon kii shaareerik kamiyaan bhi uttaradaayi he
 Such as lack of sperm count in their semen, obstruction of sperm exit, semen infection, loss of sperm speed etc
 iske vipareet mahilaon main garbhashay kaa aviksit hona, andashay main kami jaise andanu kaa na bananaa athwa gaanth, garbhashay ke mukh se sambandhit rog, yoni kaa chota hona kuch pramukh kaaran he
 The IUI technique requires the fallopian tube to be normal
 is vidhi ke tahat mahila ko pehle aisi dawaaen di jaati he, jinke asar se usamen andanu zyada banane lagen
 This increases the chances of getting pregnant
 iske baad ultrasound ke madhyam se is baat kaa pataa lagaate he ki maah ke kis din andanu nikalataa he or ise bhi niyantrit karne ke liye ek aisa injection lagaaya jaataa he, jisase thik 36 ghante baad hi andanu nikalataa he
 This makes it easy to guess at what time the sperm should enter the womb
 is andanu nirgam kii jaanch vidhi ko folicular monitoring kehete hai
 Meanwhile, the sperm of the male is cleaned properly and thickened with special techniques
 isse shukranu kii gunvattta or gatishiltaa bad jaati he
 This sperm is inserted into the womb at the time of ovulation
 aise main garbh thaharne ke avasar 40 se 60 pratishat tak hote he
 The IUI technique is also used at that time, when the sperm in the male does not exist at all or their number does not increase even after using the drug
 aise main kisi donor ke shukranu kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 After inserting the sperm, one has to see at an interval of a period of time whether the sperm got the egg or not? If not found, then this process has to be done again
 shukranu kaa garbhaadhan karaane ke pashchaat 'lutial saport' ke liye dawaaen di jaati he or mahila ko aaraam karne kii salaah di jaati he
 Conception is ensured within 12 to 16 days of this procedure
 kritrim viryasechan, 'kritrim prajnan' athwa 'kritrim garbhaadhan' kaa taatpary maadaa pashu ko swaabhaavik rup se garbhit karne ke sthaan par yantra yaa pichakaari dwaara garbhit karnaa he
 In this process, the semen of the male animal collected clean and safely is entered into the genitals or reproductive tract and the female animal is conceived
 is prakaar kritrim garbhaadhan se jo bachche paidaa hote hai ve prakritik dhang se paidaa hue bacchon ke hi samaan balvan or hrishtpusht hote hai
 Six hundred years ago in 1322, an Arab chieftain succeeded in artificially conceiving a precious mare by extracting the semen of his enemy chieftain's horse
 europe main planis ne 1876 i
 main kritrim rup se ek kutiya ko garbhit kiya tha
 The first scientific investigation on artificial semen polling was done in 1780 AD by a famous scientist of Italian physiology, Abbott Splan Jani, over a bitch
 isamen unhen purna safalataa mili
 Artificial breeding of horse first started in 1890 AD
 ek francisi pashuchikitsak ne ise pashuon main vandhyaapan dur karne kaa ek uttam saadhan bataaya
 Professor Hoffman said that in addition to natural insemination, if artificial insemination is also used, then insemination will be certain
 rus main ibanhalf se 1909 i

 main 39 ghodiyon kii yoni main kritrim viryasechan kiya
 31 of them were conceived
 usee samay swabhaavik dhang se 23 anya ghediyon ko bhi garbhit kiya gaya, kintu unamem se keval 10 main hi garbhadhan hua
 This proved the importance of artificial insemination and its use started increasing and artificial insemination was started in other animals like sheep, cow and dog etc
 america main 1896 i
 main 19 kutiyon kii yoni main viryasechan kiya gaya, jinamein se 15 garbhit hui or bachche die
 As a result of this experiment, artificial semen was adopted by Europe and America very quickly
 is reeti kaa upyog saare sansar-england, italy, germany, sweden, denmark, austrailia, canada, china or rus aadi-main badi teji se bad rahaa he
 Artificial semen in India started in 1942 AD at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute
 tatpashchaat iske anek centre bengal, bihar, punjab, madras, madhyapradesh, bombai or uttar pradesh main khule
 Currently, there are thousands of artificial insemination centers in India and their number is increasing every year
 is prayog se ab har saal lakhon pashu garbhit kiye jate hai
 For this, semen is collected in many ways: by artificial vagina, mechanical handling and electrical stimulation etc
 veery ko ekatra karne ke uparaant kritrim garbhaadhan turant kar dena sabase acha hota he
 If artificial insemination cannot be performed immediately, the semen should be kept in a clean, sterile, or in a test tube, in a cool, 1
3 to 2
5 cm
 Can be placed on is dhang se veery teen se lekar paanch dinon tak garbhaadhan yogya rahata he
 Several types of solutions are also slowed by mixing in semen; But experiment has proved that the extract of semen is more useful
 veery ko ek vishesh dhang se sukhi barf dwaara jamaakar rakhaa jaataa he
 The semen is melted before it is used
 veery jamaane or uske upyog par sansar ke vibhinn bhaagon main bahut se anusandhan kaary ho rahe hai
 By using this, the semen of special young bulls can be sent easily from one country to another
 or har samay upyog ke liye saralata se mil saktaa he
 The semen thus deposited can be successfully used for two years
 jis samay maadaa pashu garam hoti he us samay uski punch ko uthaakar ekatrit veery ko uski yoni main pichakaari dwaara daal diya jaataa he
 According to nature, every female animal keeps warming at certain time and this time varies for every animal, like cow, buffalo and mare are warmed on the 21st day
 garam rahane kaa samay bhi bhinn-bhinn pashuon main bhinn hota he
 It lasts only 12 to 18 hours in cows and buffaloes and in mare for about a week
 garam avasthaa samaapt ho jane par, swabhaavik athwa kritrim rup se veery pravesh karaane par garbh nahin thahartaa
 In any natural way, when the conception is in the animal, then on the 21st day, the heating stops
 dekha yah gaya he ki maadaa pashuon main 50-60 pratishat garbh hi ek baar main sthit hota he
 Artificial insemination is facilitated and necessary for milk production and animal husbandry and for increasing animal wealth
