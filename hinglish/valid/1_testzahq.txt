 Assamese is the official language of the Assam province of India and the principal language spoken in Assam

 In terms of linguistic family, it is related to Arya language family and it is closely related to Bangla, Maithili, Oriya and Nepali
 gearsan ke vargeekaran kii drushti se yah bahari upashakha ke purvi samudaay kii bhashaa he, par sunitikumar chatarji ke vargeekaran main praachya samudaay main iskaa sthaan he

 Assamese is not the only dialect in its state

 For a long time, there has been an attempt to prove Assamese a subpoena of Bengali
 asamiya kii tulana main bangala bhashaa or sahitya ke bahumukhi prasar ko dekhakar hi log is prakaar kii dhaaran banaate rahe hai
 But from the linguistic point of view, parallel development of Bangla and Assamese can be easily seen
 magadhi apbhransh ke ek hi strot se nicksruth hone ke kaaran donon main samantaayein ho sakati hai, par unke aadhaar par ek duusari kii boli siddh nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In terms of regional expansion, several sub-forms of Assamese are found
 inamen se do mukhya hai - purvi rup or pashchimi rup
 In terms of literary usage, the eastern form is considered the standard
 purvi kii apeksha pashchimi rup main boligat vibhinnataayen adhik hai
 In these two main forms of Assamese, sound, grammar and vocabulary find differences from these three views
 asamiya ke shabdasmooh main sanskrit tatsam, tadbhav tathaa deshaj ke atirikt videshi bhashaaon ke shabd bhi milte hai
 The number of words adopted from non-aryan languages is also not small
 bhashaa main saamanyat: tadbhav shabdon kii pradhanta he
 The words of Persian, Arabic and Portuguese and some other European languages have also come through Hindi Urdu
 bhartiya aryabhashaon kii shrunkhlaa main purvi seemaa par sthit hone ke kaaran asamiya kai anarya bhashapariwaron se ghiri hui he
 Being a border language at this level, words from many sources of non-aryan languages are found in its vocabulary
 in sroton main se teen apekshaakrit adhik mukhya hai : In the context of this mixed group of terms, it would be appropriate to clarify that Khasi, Bodo and Thai elements have been borrowed in Assamese, but the mixture of Malayan and Kolar elements is a result of the traditional mixture of Muladhara in these languages
 anarya bhashaaon ke prabhaav ko assam ke anek sthannaamon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he

 The earliest available form of the script is the copperplate of Bhaskaravarman dated to 610 AD

 Some of the authors of these couplets, Siddhas, had a close relationship with the Kamrup state

 are some of the forms of this oral Sahi
 asamiya bhashaa kaa purvavarti, apbhranshamishrit boli se bhinn rup praaia: 18veen shatabdi se spasht hota he
 Keeping in view the linguistic features, three periods of Assamese development can be considered: 14veen shatabdi se 16veen shatabdi ke ant tak
 This period can then be divided into two eras: the pre-vaishnava "era" and the Vaishnavite
 is yug ke sabhi lekhakon main bhashaa kaa apana swaabhaavik rup nikhar aayaa he, yadhyapi kuch pracheen prabhaavon se vah sarvatha mukt nahin ho saki he
 Grammatically there is not enough uniformity in the language

 The chaos of the pre-vaishnava-era language ends here

 Bhattadeva gave Assamese prose literature a structured look

 It was these people who started the monthly magazine Jonaki, which started the shadowy movement in Assamese

 In the field of social novels, the names of Devachandra Talukdar and Bina Baruva figure prominently

 inaki rachanaaon kii visheshta lok-vaani kaa adbhut prayog rahi he jisase janamanas par inkaa amit prabhaav padataa he
 The voice of the sweet and simple sage Shiromani Raidas is like a bridge between the knowledgeable and the romantic branches
 prachinkaal se hi bharat main vibhinn dharmon tathaa maton ke anuyaayi nivas karte rahe hai
 In all these, the saints have contributed significantly from time to time to increase harmony and brotherhood
 aise santon main shiromani raidas kaa naam agraganya he
 He was Gurubhai of Sant Kabir because he also had Guru Swami Ramanand
 inaki yaad main magh purna ko ravidaas jayanti manaai jaati hai

 Raidas had gained sufficient practical knowledge from the association of saints and saints

 They used to do their work with utmost diligence and diligence and paid lot of attention to completing the work on time
 unki samyanupaalan kii pravriti tathaa madhur vyavhaar ke kaaran unke sampark main aane vaale log bhi bahut prasann rahete the
 Ravidas ji was very benevolent and kind from the beginning and it became his nature to help others
 sadhu-santon kii sahaayta karne main unako vishesh anand miltaa tha
 They used to give them shoes without paying any price
 unke swabhaav ke kaaran unke mata-pita unase aprasann rahete the
 After some time he drove Ravidas and his wife away from their home
 ravidaas ji pados main hi apane liye ek alag imaarat banaakar tatparta se apane vyavsaay kaa kaam karte the or shesh samay ishwar-bhajan tathaa sadhu-santon ke satsang main vyateet karte the
 The small events of his life reveal his qualities related to the observance of time and speech
 ek baar ek parv ke avasar par pados ke log ganga-snaan ke liye ja rahe the
 When one of the disciples of Raidas urged them to walk too, they said, i must walk for Ganga-bathing, but today i have promised to make shoes for a person
 yadi main use aaj juute nahin de sakaa to vachan bhang hoga
 When Ganga goes to bathe, if the mind remains here then how will it attain virtue? It is advisable to do whatever the mind is prepared to do with the inner conscience
 man sahi he to ise kathaute ke jal main hi gangasnan kaa punya praapt ho saktaa he
 It is said that after this kind of practice, the proverb became popular - that if the mind is healed, the Ganges is in disarray
 raidas ne oonch-neech kii bhaavana tathaa ishwar-bhakthi ke naam par kiye jane vaale vivaad ko saraheen tathaa nirarthak bataaya or sabko paraspar miljul kar prempurvak rahane kaa upadesh diya
 He himself composed melodious and devotional hymns and used to recite them passionately
 unka vishwaas tha ki ram, krishna, kareem, raghav aadi sab ek hi parameshwar ke vividh naam hai

 the same God is praised
 krisn, kareem, ram, hari, raghav, jab lag ek na pekha
 Ved Qateb saw Quran, Puranan, Sahaj one
 
 He believed that devotion to God, observance of virtue, goodwill and good behavior is essential
 abhimaan tyaag kar dusron ke saath vyavhaar karne or vinamrata tathaa shishtataa ke gunon kaa vikaas karne par unhone bahut bal diya
 In one of his hymns, he has said- kah raidas teri bhagati doori he, bhaag bade so paavai
 On the public pride mete, the public is selected
 unke vichaaron kaa aashay yahi he ki ishwar kii bhakthi bade bhagya se praapt hoti he
 a person working without pride is successful in life, as the giant elephant is unable to pick up the sugar particles, while the small body papilla easily selects these particles
 isi prakaar abhimaan tathaa badppan kaa bhav tyaag kar vinamratapurvak aacharan karne vaala manushya hi ishwar kaa bhakt ho saktaa he
 Raidas's voice was filled with true feelings of devotion, desire for the larger interest of society and human love
 isliye uskaa shrotaaon ke man par gaharaa prabhaav padataa tha
 His hymns and sermons gave people such education that a satisfactory solution to their doubts was made and people automatically became their followers
 unki vaani kaa itnaa vyapak prabhaav padaa ki samaaj ke sabhi virgon ke log unke prati shraddhalu ban gayi
 It is said that Meerabai was very impressed by his devotion and became his disciple
 varnashram abhimaan taji, pad raj bandahijasu kii
 doubt-granth khandan-nipan, Bani Vimul Raidas
 
 Even today the teachings of Sant Raidas are very important for the welfare and upliftment of the society
 unhone apane aacharan tathaa vyavhaar se yah pramanit kar diya he ki manushya apane janm tathaa vyavsaay ke aadhaar par mahaan nahin hota he
 Only qualities like superiority of ideas, work inspired by the spirit of the interest of society and good behavior are helpful in making a man great
 inhen gunon ke kaaran sant raidas ko apane samay ke samaaj main atyadhik sammaan mila or isi kaaran aaj bhi log inhen shraddhapurvak samaran karte hai
 Raidas Manush could not join till caste was formed

 Gauri's assassination caused widespread reaction among Indian journalists and intellectuals

 Social mobilization sites such as Facebook, Twitter, etc
 also reacted to the killing

 In the last editorial written before the assassination, Gauri criticized Hindutva organizations and the Sangh for making false news and spreading it among the people
 unhone likhaa tha ki- "is hafte ke ank main mere dost dow vaasu ne goabals kii tarah india main phek news banane kii factory ke bare main likhaa he

 The spreaders were the people of the Sangh
 What is this lie? The lie is that where the Government of Karnataka will speak, it is to install the statue of Ganesh ji, before that one has to deposit one million, what will be the height of the idol, for this permission will have to be obtained from the government, immersion from the paths where people of other religions live
 Can not move for Firecrackers can not leave, etc
 The people of the Sangh spread this lie a lot
 This lie spread so loudly that in the end, Karnataka Police Chief RK Dutta had to call the press and explain that the government has not made any such rule
 This is all lies

 In all the plays of 'shardiya', there is a feeling of seeing the problem in a broader perspective, but the circumcision of the problem is so small that it does not become the basis of any comprehensive truth

 'konark' is a great drama

 Despite the fact and theatricality of the incident, Mahashilpi Vishu's concern and courageous use of the ritual, the process of fighting and combating the totalitarian tendency of the system and its culmination make the play an important creation

 The term rustic language is also used for trucks

 The study of geomorphic changes is also often called dynamic geology
 spasht he ki yah naam prishthiya vaataavaran kii gatisheel sthiti kii ore sanket karata hai, kintu aajkal yah naam kuch vishesh prachlit nahin hen or iske sthaan par bhautik bhuvigyaan adhik prachlit he
 There are three main parts of this science, which are as follows: prakritik karkon dwaara prishthiya shailon kaa kshay, apradan evam anaachhadan tathaa usase utpann avsaad ityadi kaa parivahan, Accumulation of depression and sanchit avsaad kaa sangyojan or drudhibhavan The natural factors that affect the surface matter can be divided into two classes according to the condition of their playground: dharatleey or Visceral inamen dharatleey karkon kii kriyaatmak urja pradhanthya evam charmat: surya se utpann hoti hai
 In this category, various components of the atmosphere, rain etc
, visceral waters and fountain, river and glaciers, sea and lake are particularly notable
 inkaa kreedakshetra mukhyat: bhumandal kaa thal bhaag hota hai, jisamen samudri tat bhi sammilit honge
 They do not have any effect on the surface of the ocean and their penetration is relatively subtle even in the deepest parts of the surface
 aantbhom karkon kii urja kaa pradhan strot prithvi kii aantarik ushnata hi he
 In this category, planing, volcanic play, heat and earthquake etc
 occur
 spasht he ki inkaa mul kreedakshetra dharaatal ke neeche he or unase utpann prabhaav dharaatal ke upar kabhi aa jate hai or kabhi nahin aa pate
 There are four main components in the atmosphere which are working towards the earth: rain, heat change, frost and wind
 varsha ek bahut saamaanya, kintu atyant shaktimaan kaarak he
 Its method of work is somewhat chemical and some forced
 purnataya shuddh jal main rasinic kriya karne kii kshamta praaia: bilkul nahin hoti
 Although most of the rainwater is pure before reaching the earth, both atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide merge in it when coming from the sky
 oxykrut or carbonikrut varshajal kii abhikriya se prishthiya shailon ke anekanek khanij apni apni prakruti ke anusaar oxidon or carboneton main parivartit ho jate hai
 Some minerals, or many molecules, also form chemical compounds hydrate with water
 is prakaar varshaalay kii rasinic kriya dwaara shilaayein apaghatit ho jaati hai
 Newly formed substances have some solutes and some insoluble
 viley ansh banane ke saath hi jal main villin hokar bah jate hai or aviley ansh jahaan ke tahaan chhot jate hai
 The indestructible portion consists of clay molecules and sand, which accumulate over time to form different levels of soil
 kabhi kabhi aviley padaarth ko sanchit hone kaa avasar hi nahin mil paata, apitu varsha kaa jal dharaatal par behate hue use bhi purnataya athwa anshat:, apane saath bahaakar le jaataa he
 As long as the water has the power to drain the substance, it goes on flowing and when the power is depleted it sits where it is
 is prakaar varsha ke jal dwaara bahaae hue padaarth ko kehete hai
 Its volume depends on the slope of the surface and the speed of rainfall
 dhaal kii pravanta or varsha kii tivrata donon hi varsha ke jal ke bahaane kii shakti ko varddhit karti hai
 Local climate also has a great effect on the results of rainfall, if the amount of annual rainfall in the two regions is often the same, but one has light splashes and the other has occasional but very intense rainfall, So the effect of rainfall will be different in these two regions
 isi prakaar sookhe or barsaati mausamon ke ekantaranwale pradeshon main bhi varsha kaa prabhaav ekadam bhinn ho jaataa he
 Variation of heat also has an effect on the activation of rainfall
 ushnatapradhan deshon main varsha ke jal main apghaton karne kii shakti, sheetapradhan deshon kii apeksha, kahin adhik hoti hai
 Due to alternating heat and cold, the rocks are broken apart, turning into thick or fine powder
 dravya kaa yah saadhaaran gun he ki garmi ke prabhaav se failata he or sardi paane par sikudta he
 The amount of expansion and contraction depends on the material, that is, some fluid expands more and some less
 bahut si shilaayein do, teen yaa or adhik khanijon kii bani hoti hai
 Therefore, in the heat of the day, all these minerals are spread according to their own properties and in the night it gets frosty and shrinks
 kaai khanij kam failata he, kaai adhik
 The mineral that spreads more puts a type of pressure on others, causing the particles to break apart
 din prati din is prakram ke chalate rahane se prabhaav badhata jaataa he or kalantar main shailon kii upree paraten churnapraia ho jaati he
 It is obvious that the greater the difference in temperature between day and night, the greater the velocity the rocks will be separated
 is kriyaamein khanijon ke rasinic sanghatan main praaia: bilkul hi parivartan nahin hota, keval khanijon ke parsparik bandhan itane deele pad jate hai ki ve ek duusare se pruthak ho jate hai
 That is why this action is called dissolution
 varsha or taapaparivartan donon kii sammilit kriya se, jo bahudhaa prakruti main hoti he, Both the decomposition and disintegration of rocks are encouraged
 tushaar kii kriya bhi keval balkrit hi hoti he
 The source of the power of this factor is the common circle that at 4 ° c the relative density of water is maximum
 isse or adhik thandha hone par ghanatv kam hone lagata he, arthath duusare shabdon main yah kahana chahie ki jal ke aaytan main vruddhi ho jaati he
 When the water is converted into ice at 0 ° C, then its volume often increases to tenth hour
 at: kritrim vidhi se barf jamaane main is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana nitant aavashyak hota he ki barf ke bade hue aaytan ke liye paatr main rikt sthaan hona chahie
 In the absence of this space, the pressure of the spreading ice is expected to cause the character to burst
 isi vrut ke anusaar sheetapradhan deshon main jab shilaayein tushaar ke prabhaav main aati hai, to unke ang ang chhin bhinn ho jate hai
 Water penetrates into the pores and walls of the rocks and freezes every day when it gets cold and melts when it gets hot
 isse kuch hi kaal main chattaanon kii upree paraton ke avyav kamjor or praaia: asambaddha ho jate hai
 Later, due to the shock of rain and wind, they spontaneously crumble
 bahudhaa tushaar kaa yah prabhaav visphoti hota he
 In those parts of the winter months where the vegetation is less, open, uncultivated rocks are thus covered with broken rock blocks and large amounts of such blocks are collected in the hills of the hills, known as Shailamalba
 in khandon kaa koi nishchit aakaar nahin hota or inke kone bahudhaa nukile evam paine hote hai
 Tusshar is a very powerful factor for rock disintegration, but its area of work is only cold
 vaayu ke vishisht kreedakshetra registan or unche parvaty pradesh hai, jahaan yah bahudhaa teevr gati se bahati he
 It has the unique ability to perform forced erosion under favorable conditions
 isaki shakti kaa mukhya rahasy is baat main he ki yah anginati chote bade baaluu or mitti ke kanon ko badi teevr gati se uda le jaati he
 These particles repeatedly collide with each other while flowing in the raging wind, causing abrasion and gradually becoming smaller
 saath hi jhanjhaavat ke maarg main jo pahaad, chattaane evam pathar ke khand aa jate hai, un sabake upar bhi ye baaluu jhonka kii bhanti aghat karte hai, jisase ve sabhi apgharshit hote rahete hai
 Generally, sand is not able to rise to much higher than the ground level
 is kaaran vaayu kii apradan-kriya-kshetra kii oonchaai bhi usee anupaat se simit rah jaati he
 As a result, in the desert regions often the lower parts of the hills and rocks become thin and narrow, but the upper body is left unaffected
 is prakaar ke adhoradan se kukuramutta aadi saddash kuch vilakshan akritiyaan ban jaati hai
 In the desert regions, the direction of wind is usually the same for a long time, due to which the direction of their abrasion and erosion is also unchanged for a long time
 is kaaran registaanon main vayutpann golashm gol matol na hokar, koniya or falkeey hote hai
 In fact, for them, the word 'gholam' is inappropriate and should be used in place of the German word decanter
 vaayu main apradan ke saath saath parivahan kii bhi vilakshan shakti he
 Fine sand and dust particles are carried by the vast quantities of air from the desert regions every year and deposit in places where their velocity decreases and the grass and shrubs obstruct its path
 is prakaar se pariwahit padaarth ke nikshepon ko vaiudh baaluu or vaiudh mrittika kehete hai
 In northern China, there is a large deposition of this type of eolian clay, which is 300 to 450 meters in thickness, and which the wind has brought here from the deserts of Central Asia
 varsha dwaara laae hue jal kaa kuch bhaag vashpikaran se pun: vayumandal main chalaa jaataa he, kuch dharaatal par bahata hua nadiyon ke maarg se samudr main pahunch jaataa he or kuch prithvi main ant:sravit ho jaataa he
 The part which flows on the ground is called runoff and the surface which is endowed, is called underground or visceral water
 in teenon bhaagon kaa parsparik anupaat sthaneey jalwaayu, sthalakriti or bhoumiki par nirbhar rahata he
 The amount of evaporation prevails in regions of humid climate
 samaan jalwaayu ke pradeshon me sthalakriti kii vishmata ke saath apwaahit jal kii maatra adhik hoti jaati he
 The circle of geology is also very important, because some rocks are very fringed, but their penetration is very small, such as rock and clay
 inke atirikt ek teesri shrenee kii shilaayein na to randhri hoti or na praveshya, jese granite
 Thus, the amount of water that is injected depends on the physical characteristics of the local rocks
 dharaatal main kuch gaharaai par pahunchne par, bhoomi or shail jal se santrupt ho jate hai
 The surface of saturation is called the ground level
 is str kii gaharaai kshetravishesh kii vaaðshak varsha kii maatra, sthalakriti or sthaneey bhoumikeey sanrachana par nirbhar hoti hai
 Generally, the soil is closer to the ground in wet areas than in dry areas
 samudr, jhil, sarovar evam badi nadiyon ke samipsth bhaagon main bhi yah str apekshaakrit dharaatal ke sameep hota he
 It goes deep due to drought and comes up when there is excess rain
 aantbhaum jal prishth main kitni gaharaai tak samaa saktaa he, yah baat bhi sthaneey shailon kii sanrachana par nirbhar he
 Water enters the foliage sites and estuaries between the rocks, so the depth to which the rocks contain foramen, or fissures, is as far as collapsing in most of the fissure due to the pressure of the underground rocks
 randhravkash bhi alp ho ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, the visceral water does not go to the depths and starts moving towards the earth
 antat: iskaa lakshya samudr he
 Sometimes it reaches there by underground routes and sometimes it gets such routes, from which it again reaches the ground as springs
 khule hue tathaa chaude vidaron or sandhitalon ke atirikt, anyatra aantbhaum jal kii pravaahgati saadhanya ati mand hoti he
 This is why it does not have the power to perform any type of forced action, but it can do chemical action in favorable conditions
 vidar or sandhitalon ke anuprastha aage badhate hue yah, varshajal kii hi bhanti, deevaaron ke shailon ke khanijon ko oxikrut, carbonikrut, athwa jalyojit kar detaa he or is prakaar shail kaa apghaton ho jaataa he
 In the terrain where limestone rocks are present, there is a large area of working underground water
 carbonikrut jal main chuunaapatthar villin ho jaataa he
 Therefore, the water flowing from the limestone's seventies merges many parts of it into caves
 kabhi kabhi is prakar bani gufaaon kaa aakaar bada, kai sau meter tak lanbaa or 4-5 meter gaharaa ho jaataa he or inamen se bahata hua jal aantbhaum nadi bana detaa he
 Somewhere carbonated water starts dripping from the roof of the cave
 tapakate pani kii kuch bhaag vashpikrut hokar ud jaataa he or usamen viley calcium carbonate tapakanevaale sthaan par avakshepit ho jaataa he
 Frequent dripping of droplets at the same place and continuous precipitation of calcium carbonate at the same place creates a columnar amount, called stalactite
 isi prakaar kii kriya gupha ke farsh par tapake hue jal ke vashpkaran se bhi hoti he or usase bhi avakshepit carbonate se aisi stambhakar akruti banati he jo farsh se chat kii ore badhati he
 These shapes are called stalagmites
 kabhi kabhi stalegmite ek duusare kii ore badhate hue milakar gupha kii chat se farsh tak kaa satat stambh bana dete hai
 Sometimes there is no specific form of precipitated carbonate amount
 aisi avasthaa main use calk nisaad, tupha yaa travertine kehete hai
 In some caves, the amount of carbonate precipitated in this way becomes so large that such carbonate can carry on business
 upar yah ullekh kiya gaya he ki kabhi kabhi aantbhaum jal soton ke rup main pun: dharaatal par laut aata he
 This phenomenon depends on the specific configuration of local rocks
 yadi koi baluupathar kaa randhri shail, r, is prakaar vinyast ho ki uske upar or neeche purnataya athwa praaia: apargamya shail, mrittika, shell yaa anya koi usee gun kii shilaayein sthit hon, to aantbhaim jal randhri shail main risataa hua, apargamya shila ke upree sansparsh tal tak pahunchne ke baad, staron kii dhaal ke anusaar pashrvavarti disha main badhane lagegaa
 In the same direction, wherever that rock is uncovered in a natural cut, the water will start flowing in the form of springs
 bahudhaa shailon main upasthit bhranshatal bhi soton ke banane main sahaayta dete hai
 If due to a fault, the impermeable rock is displaced and located in the proximity of the stomata and permeable rock, then at the place where the erosion will be transverse to the natural cut, there will be springs falling
 soton ke pani main praaia: sadaiv khanij padaarth thodi bahut maatra main villin hote hai
 When their quantity is more than 1 per cent by weight, then it is called mineral spring
 par sarsaadhaaran vyavhaar main kisi bhi aise sote ko, jiske pani main villin khanij padaarth ke kaaran kuch vishisht swaad ho, khanij sota kehete hai
 But in normal practice, any spring, which has some specific taste due to the mineral content dissolved in the water, is called mineral spring; However, minerals like calcium carbonate are very abundant and do not give any flavor and magnesium salts start tasting even in very small amounts
 soton kaa pani bahudhaa dabaav ke adheen hota he
 There is a decrease in pressure as the water comes out and the solubility of water also decreases with it
 at: soton ke udgam sthaan par bahudhaa khanij padaarth avakshepit ho jaataa he
 The composition of this substance is usually powdery or silicic and, according to the depositional composition, is called calc nisad, or silicic acid
 kabhi kabhi louh carbonate, athwa anya lavan, yaa gandhak bhi avakshepit ho jate hai
 The water of any spring is very hot and sometimes the water is also radioactive
 bihar rajya main rajgir ke garam pani ke sote bahut prasiddh hai
 The water of these springs often comes from very deep parts of the surface
 kuch soton kaa pani aantbhaum na hokar megmiy utpatti kaa bhi hota he, arthath aisa jal jo sudur garbh main megmiy padaarth se nikle hue vaashp se yukt hota he
 Such fountain is called magmatic fountain
 kahin kahin aantbhaum jal aisi vishisht paristhiti main vidyaman hota he ki us sthaan par kuan banane se pani swat: upar chadh aata he or kahin kahin to pani kii dhar fauware kii bhanti dharaatal se kai meter tak upar uchhalati hui nikalati he
 These are called excretory follicles
 inke banane ke liye anivaary praveshya pratibandh ye hai: aantbhaum jal ek aise randhramay or apraveshya shail ke andar sanchit ho jiske upar or neeche donon ore apargamya shail avasthit hon, staron ke pravan kii disha main jal ke bahakar nikal jane kaa maarg avaruddha ho or jal kaa mul strothasthaan, kuna banane ke sthaan se itani oonchaai par ho ki vaanchhneeya taral sthitik daab utpann ho, jiske prabhaav se kuan banane par jal swat: dharaatal tak upar uth jaay
 a very remarkable condition has been found at the Neyveli site in the South Arcot district of Madras province, where huge peat deposits have been found
 vahaan utsrut jal kii daab or maatra donon hi itani adhik hai ki peet ke utkhanan main bahut kathinaayee hui he, tathaa jal ko niyantrit karne ke liye vishesh saadhan prayukt karne pade hai
 The river is very effective and functional among natural factors
 yah apradan, parivahan or nickshepan, teenon hi prakaar ke kaary atyadhik pariman main karti he
 Although the importance of the work of rainwater is of little importance, its effect and fruit appear to be more pronounced as the action of the river is concentrated in long and relatively narrow valleys
 varshajal kii bhanti hi nadi kaa jal bhi apni ghati ke tal or kinaaron ke shailon ko rasinic kriya dwaara apaghatit kar saktaa he
 The solute fraction of the decomposed material thus dissolved in the river water and the insoluble portion also flows along the ravine
 yah kriya nadi apane parvatiy pradesh ke maarg main sugamawa se karti he, kyonki vahaan ghaar itani vegvan hoti he ki praaia: sadaiv nae, anpadhtit shailon kii staren anaachhadit hoti rahati hai jisase ki ve sahaj hi kriya ke prabhaav main aati rahati hai
 But when the velocity of the torrent in the plains decreases, the valley floor is covered with soil and sand cover
 falat: anpadhtit shailon se sampark bhi kam ho jaataa he
 In areas where limestone rocks are high, chemical activity is very abundant in those areas, because in carbonated water, limestone dissolves spontaneously
 rasinic kii apeksh balkrit apradan karne kii shakti nadi main bahut adhik hoti he
 Generally pure water cannot degrade the rocks, but when sand and gravel are mixed in it, the situation changes, as they both support each other
 nadi kaa kaa jal shakti pradaan karata he or baaluu evam bajri apgharshan karte hai, jiske prabhaav se tah or kinare shanai: shanai: chote hote jate hai
 In addition, they themselves take part in desilting the rocks of the fold
 nadi kii apgharshan shakti ghaar kii tivrata par nirbhar he or dhar kii tivrata sthalakriti par aadhaarit he
 The more prone the gradient is, the sharper is also sharper accordingly
 saath hi jal kii maatra bhi dhar kii gati ko prabhavit karti he
 The speed of the blade increases with the ratio of its speed to its cube root, that is, if the volume of water becomes eightfold, the speed of the edge becomes double
 falat:, jin deshon main sookhe or barsaati mausam pruthak pruthak hote hai, vahaan nadiyon kii apradan shakti barsaat ke dinon main bahut bad jaati he
 Initially, the banks of the river are usually steep and rich, especially in hard rock areas
 kintu vayumandaleey karkon ke prabhaavavash, kinaaron ke upree bhaag shanai: shanai: apkshin hone lagate hai
 The decomposed and fragmented material produced by it carries the river
 iske falswaroop kalantar main nadi kii ghati kaa pariched j aakaar kaa ho jaataa he arthath uske donon kinare tal kii ore dhaalu ho jate hai
 The river flows from a high place to the sea, so its effort is always to cut the ground and lower it so that it becomes equal to the sea level
 is tarah nadi ke sheersh se sangam tak ke anudaidhry pariched kii pravanta sheersh kii ore sabase adhik or sangam ke sameep sabase kam hoti he
 In other words, the vertical erosion of the river is highest in the upper reaches of the valley and decreases as it moves towards the sea
 jab nadiyon kii ghati aisi sthit main pahunch jaati ki udhrvadhar kataav ek dam band ho jaay or uski ghati kaa tal samudratal ke samaan ho jaay, to vah apradan ke charam str par pahunch jaati he
 The valley in which the vertical erosion is intensely progressive is called Tarun, which has reached the peak, it is called old and its inner state is mature
 ek hi ghati ke vibhinn bhaagon main teenon avasthaaen vidyaman ho sakati hai
 If topographical changes occur in the area of an old Sarita valley due to the influence of prudential forces and the site reverberates, the river becomes rejuvenated and once again starts vertical harvesting
 saadharantaya nadi kii ghati kii pravanta kramik haati he, yadhyapi pravanta kii maatra sthaan sthaan par ghat bad sakati he
 But sometimes the diathesis also becomes obsolete and waterfalls are formed
 yah sthiti visheshkar aise pradeshon main hoti jahaan kathor or mridu shilaon kaa ekantaran hota he
 Soft water flows away easily and easily, due to which there is a large amount of engraving in the valley
 kathor str avarodhi he or jahaan kaa tahaan khadaa rah jaataa he
 The water flowing over it starts falling into the more carved part of the soft level of the valley
 is prakaar ghati kii pravanta akramik ho jaati he or jal prapaat ban jate hai
 Often, the location of these falls also gradually diverges towards the top of the river
 hota yah he ki prapaat ke sthaan par pani ke oonchaai se girane ke kaaran nadi kii dhar main teji aa jaati he, jisase uski apradan shakti or bad jaati he
 Just below the waterfall, a kind of dahl is formed, in which whirlpools begin to fall and the rapidly moving water in them starts cutting the wall of the waterfall
 is prakaar nichevala mridu str or bhi teji se katataa jaataa he or ek prakaar kaa talochhedan hone lagata hai, jisase kathor str niravlamb hokar baahar ko nikal aata he
 Over the course of the uptake, the most forward part of the stern falls apart and falls in the absence of longitudinally, and the position of the falls retracts equal to the size of the fallen shell
 yah kriya barambar hoti rahati he or prati baar prapaat kaa sthaan kramash: peeche hat jaataa he
 Due to this type of erosion, due to the breaking of hard rock, a deep blast is formed from the initial place of the fall backwards
 jabalpur ke sip narmada nadi kii sangmarmar ke shailon main utkeern ghati or bhedaghat kaa jalprapaat is ghatana kaa sundar ddashtaant he
 The fall of the world-famous Nyagara River is made in this way
 vahaan kii gai maapon se maaloom hota he ki prapaat prati varsh apane sthaan se praaia: dedh meter peeche hat jaataa he
 It is estimated that at the same speed, it will usually take 20 to 35 thousand years to build the 11 km long valley of Nyagara
 or bhi kai paristhitiyon main jalprapaat ban sakate hai, kintu mulat: har avasthaa main ghati ke vibhinn avyavon ke apradan kii gati main antar hona aavashyak he
 These falls are salient to the young state of the valley
 apradan kii charam str avasthaa main pahunchne par nadi kii shakti apane pashrvo ko kaatane main lag jaati he
 When the valley is very straight, the two sides are cut by one, but inequality arises due to slight curvature
 ghati ke avatal pashrv kii ore dhar main adhik tivrata hoti he or isaliye udhar kataav adhik maatra main hota he
 Therefore by decreasing the velocity of the torrent towards the opposite convex side, not only the erosion stops but the asymmetry is further increased by the river and the path of the river becomes more and more curved
 is prakaar visarpi mode kii utpatti hoti he
 Often the dimensions of these turns are greatly increased and the turns also become very complex
 kabhi kabhi do mode ek dusre ke itane paas aa jate he ki unke bich kii ekadam sidhi duuri, nadi ke anuprastha maarg kii duuri kaa dashamansh yaa or bhi kam hoti he
 In such a condition, sometimes the narrow cervix between two turns begins to flow through a straight path, and one or more extracorporeal turns are discarded, which is called spasm
 nadi kaa parivahan kaary, praaia: sabhi prakritik karkon kii apeksha adhik prabhavi hota he
 The rock powder, gravel, sand, and soil produced by private erosion, all of which flows down the river to the sea, along with atmospheric factors, especially the rock powder and block produced by rainwater, in the course of some time By the way, they reach the valley of the river and holding it in the ravine, they all move slowly towards the sea
 jin bade bade khandon ko nadi kii dhar uthaane main asamarth hoti he, ve tah ke anuprastha ludhakate hue chalate hai or chote kan nilambit badhate hue chale jate he
 The power of transport is dependent on the speed of the torrent
 yadi gati main vruddhi kii maatra va ho, to parivahan shakti va6 ho jaayegi
 That is, if the speed doubles, then the transport power will become 64 times
 isse spasht he ki varshaati baadh ke samay nadiyon kii parivahan shakti or saath saath vinaash shakti kii maatra bahut bhayanak ho jaati he
 Residents on the banks of big rivers like Ganga, Brahaputra etc
 are well aware of this destructive power
 nilambit baaluu or mitti ke atirikt anekanek padaarth nadiyaan apane jal main villin kar, mahadeshiy bhaagon se samudr kii ore le jaati hai
 As mentioned in the cases of rainwater and visceral water, their chemical activity is abundant, due to which soluble substances are also formed in the same proportion
 yah sabhi padaarth kalantar main nadiyon main pahunch jate hai
 The rivers themselves produce some soluble material by their action and all of them reach the sea respectively
 gananaa kar yah anumaan kiya gaya he ki ganga or brahamputra apane sammilit maarg se praaia: 1100 n 106 ghan meter mitti or baaluu prati varsh bengal kii khadi main pahunchaa detii he america kii mississippi nadi dwaara prati varsh parivahit padaarth kii maatra 200n106 ghan meter hai
 The Hwanghao River of China carries such a vast amount of soil that the sea near its mouth remains yellow for miles and it is called the Yellow Sea
 dakshini america main amejon nadi dwaara bahaai mitti or baaluu se uske muhane ke saamne samudr ke tal main jo delta saddash bhoomi ban gai hai, vah praaia: 200 kilometre lambii he
 Estimated, the amount of material transported by all the rivers of the world is estimated to be 16 cubic kilometers per year
 jaisaa purvavarti khand main bataaya gaya hai, nadi kii parivahan shakti uski dhar kii gati par nirbhar hoti he
 So as soon as his torrent is in motion, some part of his load starts depositing immediately
 nadi ke maarg main sabase pehla mahatvapurn nickshepan centre pahaad ke tal main us sthaan par hota he jahaan vah parvaty pradesh chhodkar maidan main pravesh karti he
 Very large golashyams and small big buttons, which come rolling smoothly across the valley in the valley, sit at the bottom as they enter the river plain
 is prakaar pahaado ke tal bhaag main ek nikshep ban jaataa he, jise jalopha shanku, athwa pankhaa kehete hai
 Another important speed change is near the confluence of the river
 ek to ghati kii dhaal vahaan pahonchte pahonchte yon hi bahut kam ho jaati he, duusare samudr va jhil kaa pani bhi bahaav ko roktaa he
 Often the velocity of the torrent is reduced so much that the tidal velocity is greater than the velocity of the river, which at the time of the tide, the river's edge starts flowing backward
 iskaa fal yah he ki sangam ke paas ke pradesh main nadi badi tivrata se avsaad or talachat nickshepit karne lagati he or uski apni banaai hui ghati hi bharne lagati hai
 Due to the deposition of depression, the flow of the river becomes more difficult and the river is divided into many small streams
 kalantar main is nickshepit avsaad main ek chauras maidan sa ban jaataa he, jisamen se anek choti dharaayen ati manthar gati se bahati hui samudr kii ore jaati hai
 The plain is triangular, with one vertex at the point in the river valley from where the current begins to divide and the baseline in front of it lies transverse to the coast of the sea
 is prakaar ke pradesh ko delta kehete hai
 Due to the blocking of the motion at the confluence of the river, sand is often deposited in longitudinal zodiac signs, which is called sand blast
 jalodh shanku or delta ke bich ke bhaag main nadi bahudhaa mausami baadh or utaar se prabhavit hoti rahati he
 During the flood, the river gets so much water that it cannot fit in its valley
 falat: vah donon kinaaron ke upar se hota hua kuch dur tak fail jaataa he
 The region that comes under the influence of floods in this way is called flood plain
 us bhaag main nadi kii dhar kii gati mukhya dhar kii apeksha bahut kam ho jaati he, jisase vahaan prachur maatra main mitti or baaluu nickshepit ho jaati he
 In contrast, during flood, the speed of the main stream is much higher than the speed of normal time, so erosion increases there and the river takes away the previously deposited sand and soil
 jaisaa pehle ullekh kiya ja chukaa he, nadi kii cheshtaa apni ghati ko nirantar gaharaa kar, apradan ke charamastar par pahunchaane kii hoti he
 As the depth of the valley increases, it often comes such a situation that even during the floods, it is not possible to reach the floodplain
 aisi dasha main nadi ek nayaa baadh-maidan banaati he
 Puranwala is called the flood-plains river Vedika
 bahudhaa nadi kii ghaatiyon main abhinav tal se kaaphi upar donon kinaaron par, athwa ek hi ore, is prakaar kii vedikaaye dikhaai padati he
 Somewhere, 2-3 or even more Vedicas meet on top of each other on different floors respectively
 unke adhyayan se nadi kii ghati ke vikaas kaa itihaas janaa ja saktaa he
 In the higher mountainous regions and cold countries, colder rains bring water instead of water
 jin pradeshon main him-varsha us maatra main adhik ho jitna garmi ke samay main him pighalta he, ve pradesh sadaiv himachhadit rahete hai
 The height at which this happens is called the snow line
 yah oonchaai vibhinn vibhinn akshanshon or pradeshon main vibhinn hoti he, yatha himalay main isaki oonchaai praaia: 4,500 se 5,500 meter tak he, alps parvat 2,400 meter or norge main keval 1,500 meter he
 a large part of the sea is always snowed near the poles, especially at the south pole
 akaash se aate samay him rooyee ke gaalon ke samaan komal hota he
 In fact, there is abundant air in it
 jab ek badi raashi ekatrit ho jaati he, to upree staron kii daab se neeche kii staron main se hawa nikal jaati he or himakan aapas main milakar kathor barf ke rup main parivartit ho jate hai
 Due to the effect of gravity when collected over vast quantities, the amount of snow in the favorable topographic regions gradually slopes downwards and thus becomes a river, called glacier
 kalantar main nadi kii bhanti vah bhi apane liye ek ghati bana leti he
 Which she deepens more and more
 thos barf se utkeern hone ke kaaran himandi kii ghaatiyon ke kuch vishisht lakshan hote hai, jinamein se teen pramukh he: Their nits are wide and flattened, so that their upward passage is six-shaped, unki ghaatiyaan sarpil na hokar bahut dur tak ekadam sidhi chali jaati he or In place of the confluence of the main glacier and the tributary glacier, the bottom of the two valleys is rather gradual
 is kaaran sahaayak nadiyon kii ghati nilambi ghati kehalaati he
 Due to solid, glacial speed is very low
 kahin kahin to dinabhar main keval 30 centimetre hi aage badhati he
 Sometimes the velocity is also relatively high
 alaska main kuch himandiyaan ek din main praaia: dhai teen meter bad jaati he
 This speed, similarly to the speed of the river, depends on the amount of snow and the slope of the regional gradient
 himrekha ke neeche pahunchne par barf pighalane lagati he or saadhaaran nadi kaa rup dhaaran kar leti he
 The melting glaciers are the primary source of water of almost all the rivers coming from the Himalayas
 jin pradeshon main himrekha samudratal main praaia: baraabar hi hoti he, vahaan himandi swayan samudr main gir jaati he
 At such confluences, large amounts of ice often break away from the original river due to the pressure of the snow coming from behind and flow into the sea and flow far enough away
 in raashiyon ko plavi himshail kehete hai
 Plowy icebergs can also be formed for other reasons
 bahut thande pradeshon main kabhi kabhi aisa bhi hota he ki samudr ke paas jane par bhi himandi apana rup banaaye rahati he or tat ke sameep kii samudr tah ko bhi uttkeern kar apni ghati kaaphi dur tak aage badhaati chali jaati he
 There are many examples of valleys like this in Norway and Sweden, and they are called fyards
 nadi kii bhanti, himandi bhi chattaanon ko aparadit tathaa unase toote hue khandon kaa parivahan karti he
 But there is a great difference in the method of action of both
 jahaan nadi kii tah main anek chote-bade rode dhar ke veg se ludhakte hue aage badhate hai, himandi main unke ludhakne ke liye koi avasar nahin
 The piece that gets stuck in ice moves in the same state
 yatra tatra chattaanon ke bahut se tukade tuutakar himandi ke upar gir jate hai
 As the snowfall moves forward, these blocks also move forward as they are
 is bhinnata ke falswaroop jahaan nadi dwaara parivahit pathar kuch kaal ludhakte hue tathaa aapas main takaraate hue gol matol batiya swaroop ho jate hai, himdhar dwaara le jaye gayi khand ant tak koniya va nukile hi bane rahete hai
 Apart from this, with the help of the torrent, the river divides its transported material into separate parts on the basis of size and density, such as only thick gravel in places of sharp edge, thick sand in less sharp edge and lower and lower speed respectively
 When fine sand and clay are deposited in the valley folds alternately
 iske vipareet himandi padaarth ko isprakaar chhant nahin sakati, apitu uski lad main bade rode, maheen baaluu or mitti, vibhinn aakaaron ke khand, sab ek saath mili hue aage badhate hai
 And where glaciers begin to melt, all of them deposit together without any division
 himandi main padaarth ke parivahan kii shakti aparimit he
 Large sections of rocks can also carry snow with the same ease so that small particles
 is prakaar jahaan nadi kii ghati main maatr shail se pruthak krit badi badi rashiyaan bina chote khandon main toote hue vishesh dur tak aage nahin ja sakati, himandi kii ghati main ve nirantar aage parivahit hoti rahati he
 Where glaciers end and the snow melts, these large blocks fall
 sthaneey pradeshik shailon se inkaa koi matra sambandh nahin hota, isliye ve visthapit khand kehalaate hai
 While falling on the ground from the glacier, the first step on which they stick, they remain standing for many periods
 kabhi kabhi ye keval ek chote se kone ke bal girte hai or usee ke bal khadey rah jate hai
 In such a situation, their balance seems very stable and they are called misplaced segments
 ghati kii tah ke paas barf main phase hue khand apane nukile konon se tah kii shilaon ko kharonch daalate hai
 Depending on the pressure of the ice and the hardness of the rocks, these scratches are more or less deep
 kabhi kabhi bahut se chote chote khand paas paas hote hai
 All their rubbing creates many scratches in the same stone
 in khandon kii ragad himandi kii pravaah kii disha main hi lagati he, isliye sab kharonche ek duusare ke samaantar hoti he
 In this way, scratched rocks are called lined
 is vipareet kabhi kabhi aisa bhi hota hai ki himandi main nitil ke paas fasaa hua koi shailakhand ghati kii tah kii kathor shilaon sein ragad khaataa hua aage badhata he, jisase tah se sata hua uskaa pashrv chikna or faldaar ho jaataa hai or anya pashrv purvawat koniya va nukile chhot jate he
 In this way, glaciers are formed at the initiative
 kabhi kabhi himandi kii ghati main avasthit shailon ke tile, barf ke apgharshan se kaaphi chikne ho jaate hai or unke pashviry kone jhad jate hai
 Most of the grease is in the part of the mound that is on the opposite side of the edge, as the ice grows by rubbing it forward
 jo bhagpashrv kii dasha main hota hai, vah jyon kaa tyon khudara or nukila chhut jaataa he
 This type of mound is called rash mouth
 adhikanshat: himandi chattaanon ke khandon ko apane upree tal par hi parivahit karti han
 The rocks of the valley's bricks continue to break in time due to the effect of the frost, which causes the rock and powder to fall on the glacier near its edges and in this way, the material transported on both sides of the glacier is called the lateral moraine
 himandi ke madhya bhaag ke upar aarambh main shailakhand praaia: bilkul nahin hote, kyonki vah bhaag ghati ke kinaaron se dur hota he
 But at the confluence of two snow-rivers, the morae to the right of one and to the left of the other do not meet, and from the confluence, the middle moren becomes
 ant main jahaan himandi samaapt hoti he or barf ke pighalane se jal banataa he, vahaan barf kii sataha par or bich main laayaa hua samast padaarth girakar ekatrit ho jaataa he
 It is called Agartastha Moren
 isamen starikaran kaa nitant abhaav hota he
 If the glaciers begin to move past their first boundary due to changes in climate, or for some other reason, the ice will continue to push forward the entire amount of the previously formed frontal moraine
 iske vipareet yadi himandi sheersh kii ore hatati ho, to agrantasth moren kaa ek aster peeche kii ore banataa chalaa jayega
 Despite occupying three quarters of the land, the sea is constantly trying to increase its expansion
 pratyaksht: uskaa kaaryakshetra tatasth pradesh he, jahaan vah apni prabal tarangon dwaara chattaanon ko chhin bhinn kar bhoomi ke oobad khaabadpan ko nasht karata hua mahadesh ko apni sataha ke baraabar chauras banane kaa praytn karata he
 Even in calm weather, the waves repeatedly hit the rocks and hurt them, but during the storm, their strength increases by a thousand times
 bade bade tufaanon kii lehren praaia: 14-15 meter unchi uthati hai
 Fen, gravel and small ballasts thrown by him have been seen jumping up to 40-50 meters high
 prayek lahar apni samast jalarashi ke bhaar se tat par aghat karti he or aisa prathit hota he maano prakruti bahut bade ghan se tatasth pradesh ko peet rahi ho
 Waves also indirectly help in their erratic action
 sabhi chattaanon main maheen daraaren or chote chote chhidr hote hai
 When the waves hit the rocks suddenly and loudly, the air filled in these cracks and holes does not get an opportunity to exit and where it compresses
 laharon kii vaapasi ke samay pani kaa dabaav hatane par hawa phir fail jaati he
 This action takes place so quickly that the air that is being spread suddenly cannot even find its way out and it acts as an explosive power in a way
 kriya ke baar baar duhraane se daraaron or chhidron ke chaaron ore kii chattane fatkar tuutane lagati hai or chhidr kramash: bade hote jate hai
 Sometimes it also happens that the cracks open on both the sea and the continent
 aisi avasthaa main laharon dwaara dabaav padane par daraar kii hawa teji se jameen kii ore nikal bhaagti he or laharon kii vaapasi par utani hi teji se phir daraar main ghus jaati he
 With this happening repeatedly, the fine holes become larger and progressively become tunnels, which are called fahmoid is prakaar tatasth chattaane laharon kii pahunch kii oonchaai par dhire-dhire khekhali hone lagati hai, jisase uuparavaali chattaanon kaa ablamb bhi kamjor hota jaataa he or ve bhi shanai: shanai: tuutakar girane lagatati hai
 Gravity also participates a lot in this activity
 jahaan chattaane kai prakaar kii hon, kuch kamjor or kuch kadi, vahaan laharon ko, vastut: kisi bhi prakritik abhiktrta ko apana kaary karne main adhik suvidha hoti he; kyonki jab kamjor chattan cat jaati he, tab usase samparkwaali kadi chattan kaa aadhaar bhi kamjor ho jaataa he or uski nijee kadai kaa mahatv kam ho jaataa he
 Due to the impact of the waves, due to the breaking of the rocks, the pieces of various sizes are fast rolled and hit on the rocks, which themselves also break and become small and chubby
 isse samudr kii aghat karne kii shakti or bhi bad jaati he
 Over time the pieces are converted into gravel
 uske baad lehren unhen pal bhar bhi vishram nahin lene deteen, nirantar apane saath aage peeche dhasitati phirti hai
 As a result, after some time the pieces of gravel become very fine and very spherical, sometimes so small that they do not even sit in the bottom and are left hanging in the water
 kanon ke is prakaar chota va gelematol karne kii laharon kii shakti nadi kii apeksha kahin adhik hoti he, kyonki ek to nadi kii tah main ragadwali gati keval ek hi disha main, nadi ke bahaav kii ore hoti he, duusare nadi kii ghati ke nichle bhaag main dhar ke kam ho jane par bade bade kan jyon ke tyon pade rah jate hai or is prakaar unki uttarottar chote hone kii kriya band ho jaati he
 The tides and other types of ocean currents also contribute to the work of the waves
 inkaa vishesh ullekhneey prabhaav sangam ke paas nadiyon kii sankri ghaatiyon main hota he, jahaan jowarbhate ke kaaran tej dharaayen utpann ho jaati hai, jo balui kinaaron or pani main nimagn chattaanon ko kshay karne kaa prayaas karti hai
 These streams carry soil and sand far away from the mouth of the river and all the coastline towards the sea
 laharon ke aghat kaa prabhaav pani kii sataha se upar nikali hui bhoomi tak hi simit nahin rahata, varan samudr ke chhichley bhaagon kii tah par bhi padataa he
 It is known from experience that often their power to decay to a depth of 30 meters remains functional
 sataha ke neeche laharon kaa kaary praaia: vaisaa hi hota he jaisaa badi hui ghaas ko hansiye se kaatane kaa, arthath yon samajhnaa chahie ki lehren apane aghat se samudr main duube hue shailon kii oonchaai main asamanta dur kar ek chauras sthaan banane kaa prayaas karti hai
 Measuring the depth of the sea from place to place, it is known that around the entire land, there is usually a flat plain at a depth of 30 meters
 is maidan kii samudri anaachhadan kaa maidan kehete hai
 The natural properties of the sea and lakes differ only in size
 samudr jahaan ati vishaal evam athaah jalarashi he, jhil apekshaakrit bahut chota jalashay he
 Due to this, the velocity of waves rising in the lake and the magnitude of tides is smaller than that of the sea
 falat: bhuprishth ke prati jhil kii apardi kriya praaia: samudr ke samaan hi hoti he, keval uski maatra jhil ke aakaar ke anuroop laghu ho jaati he
 In the above description, the description of various natural factors, the transport of erosive and non-sedative action and the depression arising from it, etc
 is described
 yahan yah baat dhyaan dene yogya he ki prayek kaarak kaa kaaryakshetra vishisht he
 He takes the undissolved and decomposed material produced by his action to the lowest place of his field of action, from where the second factor according to time and environment takes him under its influence to the lowest surface of his field
 udaahranarth, varshajal kii kriya se utpann apaghatit padaarth jal kii choti choti dhaaraon evam naaliyon dwaara nadi main pahunch jaati hai or phir nadi use samudr athwa jhil main pahunchaa detii he
 In this way, the rocks formed by the frost reach the bottom of the hill with the effect of gravity and then remain there until they are under the influence of some other factor
 himandi apni kriya se utpann avsaad ko parivahit kar apane galane ke sthaan tak le jaati he
 There his influence ceases and then he comes under the influence of the river Depression
 bhuprishth kaa sabase nichalaa sthaan samudr he
 Thus, the last point of depression resulting from erosion and decomposition of rocks is the sea
 avasthavishesh ke kaaran yah ho saktaa he ki yah padaarth maarg main kisi kisi sthaan par kuch kaal tak rukta hua aage bade; phir bhi, der saber, kabhi mand gati se, kabhi tej gati se, vah samudr kii ore yatra karata hi rahata he
 The maximum load of the depression reaching the sea is upstream
 is baat kaa pehle ullekh kiya ja chukaa he ki nadi main apane parivahit padaarth ko uske aakaar ke aadhaar par bajri, baaluu, mitti ityadi main vargeekrut karne kii shakti he
 Hence, most of the depression is divided into thick, medium and fine three sections, which are deposited at a greater distance from the coast respectively, that is, the particles near the same level of the coast will be larger and smaller in the farthest part
 
 kisi bhi ek sthaan par jyon jyon avsaad adhik maatra main sanchit hoga, vahaan kaa jal bhi apekshaakrit chhichhlaa hota jayega or iske falswaroop dhar kaa veg bhi kuch bad jayega
 Therefore, the entire depression will precipitate at some distance than before and the accumulated depression will become somewhat thicker at each place, like small sand on top of small pebbles and gravel, fine sand over thick and soil over fine sand
 kuch kaal ke uparaant or adhik avsaad ke sanchit hone se samast pradesh phir or chhichhlaa ho jayega or tab avsaad kaa nickshepan pun: ek ek pag or aage pahunchne lagenge
 If, for some reason, the bottom of the sea in the above deposition center is slowly slipping and the speed of sliding is equal to the speed of depression, then even after maximum depression has accumulated, the depth of the sea will eventually remain as it is and every The deposition of particles of the same size at the place will be continuous for a long time
 ek or dasha aisi bhi ho sakati he jab samudr kii tah ke khisakane kii gati avsaad ke sanchit hone kii gati se adhik ho jaay
 In that case the effect will be reversed and the ocean will become more and more deep even after depression accumulates
 falat: vibhinn aakaar ke kanon ke nickshepan kaa sthaan kramash: ek ek pag tat kii ore badhata jayega
 In the first and third positions mentioned above, there is a convergence of different sizes, and in the second case a depression of the same size accumulates in thick quantities
 adhikansh nadiyon dwaara laae hue avsaad kii maatra varsha rituon main bahut kam hoti he
 Therefore, during the rainy season, depression is very abundant in the ocean
 bahudhaa do uttarottar varsha rituon ke bich kii avadhi main sanchit avsaad kii maatra naganya hoti he
 In such a situation, the depression accumulates intermittently and the depression in one rainy season gives an opportunity to harden and suppress before the depression of the second season
 uparishayi jal ke bhaar se avsaad ko dabane main sahaayta milti he
 As a result, the depressions in the successive rainfall seasons are not quite mixed with the earlier depressions, but accumulate in separate layers
 is kriya ko starikabhavan kehete hai
 The thickness of each layer will depend on the amount of depression that occurs in a rainy season
 ausat main yah 2 se 4 millimetre tak hoti he
 If deposition of depression persists for many years, then obviously some thicker layers will accumulate in place in thinner thin layers, and the thickness of these levels will depend on the speed of depression and the period in which depression deposition continues uninterrupted
the speed of drift and the stability of direction also have an effect on the arrangement of particles of depression deposited in staron main sanchit avsaad ke kanon kii vyavastha par bahaav kii gati or disha kii sthirataa kaa prabhaav bhi padataa he
 Fine clay and fine sand particles remain suspended in water for a long time and sit in a very quiet place
 unka nickshepan bhi apekshaakrit gahare pani main hota he, jahaan dhar ekadam shithil pad jaati he
 In such a state, the system of accumulation of particles remains constant and levels become orderly and regular
 kanon ko jamane ke liye paryaapt samay miltaa he or str samudratah ke samaantar banate chale jate hai
 On the contrary, the place of accumulation of thick sand and gravel etc
 is relatively shallow
 aise sthanon main dhar kii gati bahudhaa parivartansheel hoti he, kabhi mand ho jaati he or kabhi teevr
 In the slow state, the upper part of the accumulated depression begins to flow unfamiliarly in the state of high speed and deposits again where the edge is dim

 Additionally, in shallow water, where these coarse particles are deposited, the direction of the torrent often changes

 Therefore, along with the direction of edge, the direction of depressive levels also varies locally

 This phenomenon is called virtual propagation
 kabhi kabhi avsaad kshetron main aisi sthiti hoti he ki jal kii tarangon kii chhap bhi avsaadeey staron main mudrit ho jaati he
 In the shallow regions, especially in the tectonic tropics, the velocity of the waves is so high that the deposited sand and soil dance to their signals and often give them a wave form
 nae avsaad ke aane se purv yadi is tarangit baaluu ko sookhkar kuch ddadh hone kaa avasar mil jaay, to yah tarang rup surakshit rah jaataa he
 Depression often gets an opportunity to dry up and become strong in the state of depression

 Sometimes traces of rainwater drops also become safe in these depressions
 samudr main rahanevaale naanaa prakaar ke shalkadhari jantuon ke marane ke uparaant unke shalk samudratah main sanchit hone lagate hai
 These flakes are often rolled here and there due to the flow of waves, due to which they break and crumble and join the sand and mud brought by the river

 Levels of pure soil, or sand, are able to accumulate only in places where shark-bearing creatures are often absent
 kabhi kabhi shalk tuutane se purv hi avsaad main dab jate hai or us avasthaa main ve jyon ke tyon surakshit ho jate hai
 In this way, safe shells are called fossils

 Thus sand levels accumulate in shallow waters, soil levels in relatively few deep waters, and limestone sedimentary rocks in more deep marine parts

 If there is a lake in these states in which the amount of burning by the rivers and rainwater is less than that of the steam that blows, then that lake starts drying up and can be completely destroyed
 nadiyon ke pani or varshavah main saadharantaya kuch na kuch lavan ghule rahete hai
 Therefore, new salt material comes in the lake daily by the rivers
 ushnata ke prabhaav se pani bhaap banakar ud jaataa he, parantu lavan peeche hi chhot jaataa he
 Therefore, the water of the lake becomes progressively more salty or saline
 kalantar main lavan itani adhik maatra main sanchit ho saktaa he ki jhil kaa jal usase santrupt ho jaae
 Excess evaporation will cause the salt to dissolve, causing the depression to become salty
 yadi lavan ke avakshepan ke samay nadiyon dwaara laae hue avsaad kii maatra bahut kam ho, to praaia: vishuddh lavniya str avakshepit ho sakate hai

 As the levels of depression increase, the pressure of the new material rises above the lower levels
 praaia: 300 meter mote avsaadeey staron kii daab 80 kilogram prati varg centimetre hoti he
 Therefore, when only 60 meters of mouthed levels are accumulated, the pressure at the lowest levels will often be 13 kg per square centimeter
 jalashay ke pani kii daab bhi kuch kam nahin hoti
 The pressure of water per one meter is 100 grams per square centimeter

 Generally some salts dissolve in reservoirs or underground water
 When this water flows out of the sedimentary depression, due to some different reasons some of its salts precipitated between the particles of depression, its free radicals are hardened together
 And depression transforms into hard, compact stone

 Depression in sea or other reservoirs is accumulated in levels or layers

 Depression in this activity also remains

 On 15 May 2014, the FCC decided to consider two options regarding Internet services: first, fast and slow broadband lane permits, thereby compromising net neutrality; And second, broadband is replicated as a telecommunications service, thereby preserving net neutrality
 10 november 2014 ko, raashtrapati baraak obama ne sifarish kii ki shuddh tatasthta ko surakshit rakhane ke liye doorsanchaar seva ke rup main effsisi ne broadband internet seva ko pun: parishkrut kiya

 class programing bhashaaon main prayukt ek saanchaa he jiske prayog se is prakaar ke nae char banaae jate hai
 Their new variables are often called objects in programming contexts
 ek class ke tahat kai char tathaa fnction ho sakate hai
 These variables can be private, protected or public
 kisi ek class ke saanche se ek duusare class kaa nirmaan bhi ho saktaa he jo pehle class se adhik vivaran rakh sake
 a class is a collection of many variables and functions
 isi class saanche kaa prayog karke itane hi variables tathaa function banaae ja sakate hai 
 Since similar objects can be created repeatedly using the class, this programming assumption is used repeatedly in places where multiple variables have to be defined simultaneously
 udhaaharan-swaroop kisi tithi ko dikhaane ke liye teen int kaa prayog suvidhajanak hota he - din, maheenaa or saal 
 Therefore, by defining them under a class, the same type of definition can be avoided again and again
 Class Date {int day, month, year); Date d1, d2,d3 xxrep 4 
 Similarly, it is convenient to place such methods inside the class that work on the data of the same class
 jaise ki, kisi tithi kaa din nirdhaaran, yani wo tithi somvaar he yaa mangalvaar aadi, uparokt class ke liye ek uchit vidhi ho sakati he jo class ke andar paribhaashit kii jaae
 As a result of the class concept, programmers were forced to repeatedly write the same type of code
 vibhinn bhashaaon main prayukt class ke rup thode alag hai - par sabhi ganak bhaashaon main vanshantaran, kai roopon main rah sakna or aakadon ko apane anusaar saarvajanik karnaa ek ubhayvritti he
 The description below is designed to be the basis of the c ++ language, but its ideology is seen in many other languages as well or with slight changes
 ek saamaanya class ko is prakaar se vyakt or prayog kiya ja saktaa he : Here in the first line the definition of the class and in the second line a new variable of type of class named a1 is created
 a1, a prakaar kaa ek object he
 In the above example, the definition inside the class is not shown
 ek udhaaharan ke rup main paribhaasha is prakaar ho sakati he : The above code has two int variables inside the class, a float variable and a function that intersects its two variables of type int
 class ke prayog ne bade or kai-progamaron dwaara alag-alag bhaagon main likhi jane vaali programing ko sugam banaaya he
 Its main feature is its closed-form, polymorphic and descent - ek Class ko kisi duusare class se derive karne kaa uddeshy pehle class ko or samrudh karnaa he - or duusare class main vahi sab kuch dubaara karne se bachanaa he jo pehle class main kiya ja chukaa he
 For example, if you want to add one more variable in the Date class, the day of the week, then you just have to write - isse, Date2 class main din, maheenaa or saal ke liye variable define kii aavashyaktaa nahin padi, kyonki wo Date class main pehle se maujuud he
 After this, variables of Date2 class can be created and used: programing sandarbh main ise polymorphism kehete hai
 a class can live in a different form than the other class it has created
 upar diye udhaaharan main Class a se ek nayaa class b banaaya ja saktaa he jo subtract ko is prakaar paribhaashit kare Virtual is used here

 Since the 1880s, it has been used by the military in some solid propellants, such as cordite and ballistite, as an active ingredient, and a gelatinizer for nitrocellulose

 In France, this ideology was referred to as Colbertism and in Germany to Cameroonism
 1776 i
 main prasiddh arthshaastri adam smith ne bhi apane granth ‘da velth of neshns' main iskaa vivechan kiya he
 Commercialism refers to the economic ideology that aired in the countries of Western Europe, especially in France, England, and Germany in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and developed well by the middle of the eighteenth century
 vaanijyawad kii dharna antarrashtriya vyapaar or usase praapt dhan se sambandhit he
 According to the principle of this commercialism, agriculture and its production can only grow to some extent
 krishi aarthik drushti se kuch seemaa ke baad anutpaadak bhi ho sakati he, par udyogon, vyavsaayon or vaanijya vyapaar kii vruddhi or vistaar kii koi seemaa nahin he
 With industrialization and regular growth of trade, the country will get rich and powerful by acquiring gold and silver
 yah vaanijyawad kaa mul siddhant he
 In commercialism, more emphasis was laid on the merchant class, systematic, assured and regular trade and the procurement and organization of gold and silver
 ‘‘adhik swarna praapt kar adhik balashaali bano’’ yah vaanijyawad kaa naaraa tha
 Increasing wealth increases the economic power and prosperity of the country
 isse raajnneetik lakshya saralata se praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 Internal peace and external invasions could provide protection, so the ruler, politician, thinker, economist, administrator and business class supported commercialism
 sone or chaandi kaa sanchay - vyapaar-vaanijya se dhan kii vruddhi hogi or yah dhan sone, chaandi, heere, jawaharaat, bahumoolya ratna ke rup main praapt kar unka sangrah karnaa chahie
 These are neither perishable nor changeable
 ve har samay or har avasar par prachur sampatti hi rahete hai
 The reserves of gold, silver and gems are symbols of royal power
 is badhate hue dhan se yuddh saamagree praapt kar desh main aantarik shanti or bahya suraksha praapt kii ja sakati he
 Thus commercialism is protective
 antarrashtriya vyapaar - antarrashtriya vyapaar vaanijyawad kaa aadhaar he
 Industrialization in the country and exporting the goods of the country's growing production to other countries
 aavashyak hua to rajya ke kuch vishisht udyogon ko sangrakshan dena chahie or videshi vyapaar ko protsaahit karnaa chahie
 The attainment of wealth from inter-state trade is the basis of victory in wars
 anukool or santulit vyapaar - vyapaar main paryaapt dhan praapt karne ke liye videshon ko atyaadhik maatra main vyapaarik maal beche, par videshon se apane desh main nunatam maatra main maal mangaye
 This means that countries import the minimum and export the maximum
 isse desh ko niryaat karne main bahumoolya dhaatuen-swarna or chaandi-praapt hogi or nunatam aayaat karne se videshon ko bahut kam dhan baahar bhejnaa padegaa
 This principle is called favorable and balanced trade
 aayaat kiye hue maal or vastuon kii keemten niryaat kiye gayi maal or vastuon kii keemton se adhik nahin hona chahie
 There should be a favorable balance between imports and exports
 is pranali ko apnaane se desh main adhik utpaadan hoga, adhik mudra prachlan main hogi, poonjeewaad kii protsaahan milegaa or desh aarthik drushti se balashaali hoga
 Industrial sanctions and commercial control - By increasing the state-based incentives to industrial-businesses in the country, there will not be much production by increasing them
 atyaadhik utpaadan se anek haniyaan hoti hai, jaise berogari main vruddhi, maal ke uthaav kaa abhaav, bhaavon kaa girnaa, arth-vyavastha kaa gadabadana
 Hence production has to be controlled by state laws
 niryaat ko badhaava dene ke liye rajya ko vishesh protsaahan dena padataa he
 Similarly, imports have to be controlled in the form of tax, so that the goods do not become excessively imported
 kinhin vishesh companiyon ko hi aayaat karne kii suvidhaayen di jaati hai
 This is called industrial restrictions and trade controls
 naveen vyapaarik mandiyan evam upnivesh - desh se baahar bheji jane vaali taiyaar vastuon kii khapat ke liye videshon main vyapaarik mandiyon ko praapt karnaa or vahaan se desh ke udyog-vyavsaayon ke liye kaccha maal praapt karnaa
 In order to obtain such trading mandis, powerful states settled their colonies abroad where the goods manufactured in the state could easily be sold at profitable rates
 inhen upniveshon ke bazaaron se kaccha maal bhi saralata se saste daamon par kharid kar desh main aayaat kiya ja saktaa tha
 Due to the availability of raw materials at cheap prices, there will be more production at low cost in the factories and industries of the country
 isse desh ko adhik aarthik laabh hoga
 Thus commercialism paved the way for colonialism and imperialism
 samudri yatraaen or bhugolic khojein - columbus, vascodigama, amerigo, magellan, jaan kebaat jaise saahsee navikon ne jokhimabhari samudri yatraayen karke anek naye deshon kii khoj kii
 Gradually new things were settled there
 europe ke pashchimi deshon ne visheshkar spain, portugal, holland, france or england ne naye khoje hue deshon main apane-apane upnivesh or vyapaarik nagar sthapit kiye
 Raw materials like leather, iron, cotton wool etc
 were obtained from these colonies and manufactured new items from them in their country and sent them to the colonies as exports and in return they got abundant gold and silver
 isse poonji kaa sanchay hua, aayaat-niryaat badha or desh samrudh hua
 Impact of the Renaissance - The Renaissance created a new scientific outlook in Europe, as well as greater interest and aspirations for human life
 maanav jivan ko adhik ruchikar or sukh-suvidha sampann banane kii pravriti ko protsaahan diya gaya
 This led to the rise of materialism
 bhautik sukh-suvidhaon kii purti ke liye paryaapt dhan kii maang badi or yah badhata hua dhan vaanijya-vyapaar or udyog-dhandhon se hi praapt ho saktaa tha
 This encouraged commercialism
 mudra prachlan or banking pranali - vibhinn vyavsaayon, udyog-dhandhon or vaanijya-vyapaar bad jane se vyavsaay or vyapaar pranaaliyon main sanshodhan, sudhaar or parivartan hue
 On the basis of scientific discoveries, more and more production and trade in goods started to happen in industries and businesses
 isse mudra prachlan badha or aadhunik banking pranali kaa prarambh or vikaas hua
 The banks lent their deposits to other traders, businessmen and industrialists on its credit and made easy payment of their merchandise
 isse vaanijyawad ko adhikadhik protsaahan mila
 Gradually, to make more and more capital available to traders, joint stock companies were established and developed
 in joint stock companiyon or bainkon main anek logon kii bachat kaa dhan sanchit ho rahaa tha
 This money was invested in large industries and foreign trade
 vishaal paimaane par bade kaarkaane sthapit or viksit hue
 This will increase the production of goods on a large scale, distribution and purchase and sale of goods in large quantities
 isse deshi or videshi vyapaar tathaa vaanijyawad kaa ek naveen yug prarambh hua
 Promotion and protection by the newly born states - The rise and development of national states in Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
 in balashaali rashtriya raajaaon ne desh main aantarik shanti sthapit kii or bahari akramanon se desh ko suraksha pradaan kii
 In the atmosphere of security and peace, trade and domestic and foreign trade increased and national kings encouraged the import of gold and silver
 isi bich vyapaariyon se kar ke rup main paryaapt dhan praapt ho jane se rashtriya raajaaon ne yuddh kiye or apane rajya kii simaaon kaa vistaar kiya tathaa anya mahadwipon main apane naye upnivesh sthapit kiye
 He encouraged industrialists and businessmen to increase their wealth by trading with the colonies
 faltah uttarottar badhata hua vyapaar or desh kii aarthik samruddhi rashtriya rajya kii shakti ban gayi
 Under these circumstances, commercialism and capitalism flourished a lot
 lagbhag 250 varshon tak vaanijyawad kii vichaardhaara kaa bahulya europe main rahaa
 The ideology of commercialism molded the economic policy of the nations of Europe
 europe main antarrashtriya vyapaar kaa prarambh vaanijyawad se hota he
 For economic benefit, various nations adopted a policy of balanced import-export
 vaanijyawad ke kaaran naveen udyogon ke maal ko adhikadhik niryaat kar videshon se bade paimaane par sona-chaandi or dhan praapt kiya gaya
 The principle was adopted that more and more exports of goods and reduced imports, which would make the country more prosperous
 videshi maal kii kharid or aayaat ko nirutsahit kiya gaya
 Production was increased to encourage indigenous industries
 kaccha maal praapt karne or bane hue maal kii bikri or khapat ke liye naveen upniveshon kii sthapana kii gai
 This created colonial empires
 vaanijyawad kii nitiyaan or siddhant apnaane se europe main england, france or germany jaise mahaan shaktishaalee rajyon kaa nirmaan ho sakaa
 Soon their empire spread to continents outside Europe
 poonjeewaad - vaanijyawad ne udyog-dhandhon ke prasar se poonjeevaad ko janm diya
 This capitalism led to the emergence of two classes in European society - the first class of capitalists and industrialists who established their monopoly over the means of production, and the second proletariat, which did not own the means of production of self-ownership, at a cheaper price
 But had to sell
 isse kalantar main poonjipati or sarvhaara varg main kadaa sangharsh chhid gaya, jisase vidroh or krantiyaan hui tathaa aarthik vyavastha dagamagaa gayi
 Narrow nationalism - Commercialism gave importance to one nation and paved the way for exploitation of other nations for its prosperity
 ek raashtra adhik shashakt or sampann ho gaya or anya chote-chote desh shoshit hone se or garib ho gayi
 Thus paved the way for narrow nationality
 antararashtreey vyapaarik or aupniveshik spardhaa - vaanijyawad ne vibhinn deshon main madhur maitreepurn antarrashtriya sambandhon ke sthaan par antarrashtriya vyapaarik or aupniveshik pratispardhaa ko janm diya, isse vidhwanskaari yuddh hue
 Futility of accumulation of gold and silver - Commercialism gained more importance on the accumulation of gold and silver
 faltah jis varg ke paas swarna or chaandi sanchit hote gayi vah apaar dhan sampatti ke aadhaar par aniatik, vilaasi or bhrasht ho gaya
 Moral values in society ceased
 udyog dhandhon ke vikaas hone par yah tathy saamne aayaa ki kisi desh main sone-chaandi ke bhandar kii apeksha loha, ispaat, koyala, khanij tel aadi adhik moolyawaan he
 Proper exploitation of them will make the nation more prosperous and powerful
 is siddhant ne sone-chaandi ke bhandar ko nirarthak kar diya
 Neglect of agriculture - The proponents of commercialism emphasized the maximum development of industries and businesses
 isse krishi kaa kshetra aviksit or pichhadaa rah gaya
 For the economic prosperity of any country, there should be balanced development of agriculture and industry
 lok kalyaan kaa abhaav - vaanijyawad ne raajnneetik kshetra main rajya or shaasha or aarthik kshetra main udyog-dhandhon or vyapaar ko adhik mahatv diya
 In the interest of the proletariat or the poor people or the economically backward class, there was no interest in public welfare, there were no plans or principles for this
 vaanijyawad main garibon, shilpiyon, shramikon kaa shoshan hua
 Increase in royalty and royalism - The supporters of mercantilism, businessmen and industrialists supported the powerful state because only the strong king could provide internal peace and external security for the promotion of their interests
 kalantar main desh main dhan kii prachurtaa or samruddhi se balashaali raja nirankush swechhachari shaasha ho gayi
 Kings and rulers abused their powers
 kalantar main unki nirankushta ke viruddh vidroh hue
 Due to the above reasons, intense dissatisfaction started spreading against commercialism and its principles were opposed in the changed circumstances in the 19th century
 inhen kaarnon se vaanijyawad kaa hraas ho gaya
