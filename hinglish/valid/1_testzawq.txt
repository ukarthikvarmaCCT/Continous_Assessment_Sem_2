 harshal harman gibs, dakshin africa cricketer hai jo vishesh rup se ek ballebaaj hai
 Gibbs did his schooling from St
 Joseph Marist College and then from Diocesan College in Rondebosch
 Gibbs was a talented player at the school, taking part in all three sports in the SA school teams, provincial rugby, cricket and football
 unki stamps giraane kii kshamta ke kaaran, kuch logon dwaara unhen becoward point par doosraa jonty rods mana jaataa he, saath hi crickinfo dwaara 2005 ke ant main banaae gaye ek report main yah dikhaaya gaya kii, 1999 ke cricket vishwa cap se lekar ab tak ek divasiy antarrashtriya cricket main kisi bhi kshetrarakshak dwaara sabase adhik ran out ko prabhavit karne main vah aathven sthaan par hai, saath hi dasven sarvocch safalataa dar par bhi hai
 Gibbs is said to practice at the net, rarely before a match
 kaha jaataa he ki vah is maamle main apana swaabhaavik khel khelnaa pasand karte hai
 Gibbs is remembered for giving up a relatively easy catch of Steve Waugh of Australia during the 1999 World Cup
 vah ek divasiy antarrashtriya cricket main ek over main chah chakke lagane vaale pehle khilaadi bane, jo unhone 2007 ke cricket vishwa cap main netherland ke khilaaf banaae
 8 june 2007 ko unhone saint kits main tenielle paave ke saath shaadi kar lee, lekin jald hi unka talaak ho gaya
 Gibbs has scored two double centuries in his Test career, which were both comparative innings
 unki pehali pari 1999 main, newzealand ke khilaaf, jed stadium main naabad 211 ranon kii thi
 His innings was completed in 468 balls, while his second double century, 228 runs against Pakistan, was made in only 240 balls
 Played at Newlands, this innings reached a national record partnership of 368 runs with Graeme Smith
 uske baad unhone do baar apane captain ke saath pari kii shuruyaat main 300 ran khadey kiye, test cricket ke itihaas main yah ekmaatr jodi he, jisane teen baar 300 ran banaae hai
 He also holds the record for the South African second wicket with 315 * runs in a second wicket partnership with Jack Kallis
 yah ghatana mashhoor hai kii gibs ne 1999 vishwa cap ke dauraan australia ke khilaaf khel main ek mahatvapurn kaich chhod diya, jab unhone kushi main gend ko hawa main phenkane kii koshish kii, isse pehle ki vah us par puraa niyantran kar pate
 vah khilaadi jinka unhone kaich choda, steve wa the, jinhone us match main aage jaakar shatak banaaya or australia ko jeet dilaai
 is jeet ne austrailian team ko aavashyak gati pradaan kii, jisase unhone aage jaakar toornament jeet liya
 It was claimed that as soon as the catches were dropped, Waugh told Gibbs, "you missed the World Cup" but in his autobiography "out of My Comfort Zone", Waugh denies it
 haalaanki wa ne yah zarur kaha, kii saathi khilaadi shen warn ne yah aazamaaya tha, ki gibs kii yah aadat ban gai he kii kaich lete hi aparipakvata se gend ko hawa main oochaal dete hai or unhone apane saathiyon ko yah nirdesh diya, ke vah kries jaldi na choden agar unka kaich gibs ne pakadaa ho, kiyonki ho saktaa he ke halaat vaise hi hon, jaisaa wa ke saath hua tha
 Gibbs is one of the three batsmen to score 100 runs in three consecutive innings in one-day cricket history
 dusre said anwar or jahir abbaas hai
 His 153 runs at the Potchefstroom on 3 October 2002, which were scored by the entire team together, was more than 301 runs at eight wickets, in which the Bangladeshis lost decisively
 6 oktober ko us shrinkhalaa ke dusre ek divasiy match main gibs ko lagaataar 4 baar shatak banane vaale ekmaatr ballebaaj banane kaa mauka mila
 dakshin africa ko jeet ke liye 155 ranon kii zaroorat thi or gibs shatak banane se sirf teen ran peeche rah gaye, unhone naabad 97 ran banaae
 jab jeetne ke liye sirf chah ran kii aavashyaktaa thi, tab vah 96 ranon par ballebaaji kar rahe the, lekin alok kapali ne ek leg said vid gend daali jis par chaar ran mil gaye or isane gibs kaa shatak bananaa lagbhag naammumkin kar diya
 On 12 March 2006, Gibbs scored a massive 175-run knock off just 111 balls in the fifth ODI against Australia, which led South Africa to victory
 Gibbs batted with Graeme Smith after being dismissed by Nathan Bracken, 1st of the Boeta Dipenar
 It was the highest one-day international in history and his innings broke many batting records
 This was the highest ever scored in a one-day international against Australia, breaking the record set by Robin Smith in 1993
 Apart from scoring a hundred off just 79 balls, he scored the fastest century of that vault in a one-day international against Australia
 The most important thing was that it was the fastest century scored by a South African batsman against any opposing team, although the mark was broken by Mark Boucher later that year
 other than this, unhone boundaries par 126 ran banaae jo ab tak kisi bhi ballebaaj se zyada he
 Gibbs became the first player to do so in one-day international cricket history by hitting sixes in a single over bowling Dan Van Bunje in a group stage match against the Netherlands during the 2007 World Cricket Cup
 Ravi Shastri and Sir Garfield Sobers have previously achieved this feat in the first-class cricket category, but to date no player has achieved this goal in Test cricket
 aisa karne par, unhone "habitate for humennity houseing" pariyojnaon ke liye 1 million america dollars jamaa kiye jo toornament ke praayojak joni vaakar dwaara chalaae gaye ek pratiyogita kaa hissaa tha
 It is likely that he was awarded the citizenship of St
 Kitts and Nevis
 unke chakke lagane kaa form puure toornament main jari rahaa or jab unhone ek super eit match ke dauraan, jaikab oram kii gend stand main pahunchaai, tab unhone riki ponting ki cricket vishwa cap itihaas main sabase adhik 28 chakke lagane ki barabari kar lee
unhone 2008 main county twanti-20 toornament main glamorgan liye bhi khelaa tha
 He saw a very successful time, his highest score being 98 runs off just 52 balls against Northants, but his team lost in this match
 harshal ne dubaara glamorgan ke liye 2009 ke county satr khilne kaa qaraar kiya he
 He will replace Mark Cosgrove as his overseas player in late June
 He also played for Glamorgan last season, where his highest score was 90 runs in just 10 overs against Northamptonshire
 gibs ne haal hi main 20 / 20 main yorkshaire ke liye sin kiya he, jahaan vah unke videshi khilaadi honge Due to his poor form in the last two series against England and the West Indies, he was brought down the middle order, replacing the opener
 is badlaav ke baad vah form main waapas aa gaye or puraane gend ke saath ballebaazi karne main zyada aasaan dikhne lage
 22 april 2006, ko gibs ko haal ke kharaab pradarshan kii keemat chukaani padi or unhen newjiland cricket team ke khilaaf dusre or tisare test maichon main shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 unhen test cricket main aatmavishvaas kii kami ho gai or centurian park ke pehle test main unhone keval 2 or 6 ran banaae
 dakshin africa ke mukhya chayankarta, haaron lorgat ne kaha, "hamane ek baithak kii he or yah sahmati hui he ki ek brake or agle satr main ek nai shuruyaat unhen kaaphi faayeda pahunchaayegi
 ise vyapak rup se ek kathor nirnay ke rup main dekha gaya
 He came back into the team in the middle order, but his struggle for runs continued
 On January 2007, it was more than 2 years without him scoring a century at the conclusion of the first Test against Pakistan
 vah kai avasaron par is sthiti se baahar aane vaale the, lekin chaar baar nabbe ke paas out hue
 From his one-day series in Bangladesh in March 2008 to his sixteenth one-day international innings in April 2009, Stuart Hayes, his most ardent supporter in the media, was also forced to doubt his future
 san 2003 main hes ne captaini main shaun polak ke uttaradhikari ke rup main gibs kii sifarish kii thi, lekin ab, is vajeh se kii "is avadhi main unki ballebaazi ki ausat 25
25 he, jo unki kul 35
87 kii ausat se 10 ran se bhi zyada neeche he
 "hayes felt that" Gibbs is drifting away from the adventures of the past and is not playing in the form needed to stay at the national spot
 haalanki, unhone kaha ki, gibs ekmaatr dakshin africa khiladi hai, jinhane vishwa cap main 1,000 se zyada ran banaae hai or baaki baarah main se keval sachin tendulkar 57
93 ke saath or sar vivian richards 63

 Perhaps Gibbs's current unstable situation will make South Africa pay if he believes he can take the national team to the height of success
 april 2008 main, harshal gibs nilaamee ke baad indian premier lig ke deccan chargers main shaamil ho gaye
 His mediocre performance in the 2008 season forced the Chargers management to sell him
 However, he made a great comeback in the second season and led the Deccan Chargers ahead with consecutive wins in the first four matches
 Of all the openers, the pair of Adam Gilchrist and Gibbs proved to be the most powerful
 He also played an important role in the final when he scored 53 not out after Gilchrist was dismissed without a run
 He also caught an important catch by Mark Boucher at the point when the Royal Challengers were heading for victory
 2001 main west indies daure par, kai saathi khilaadiyon ke saath marijuana kaa dhumrapaan karne ke kaaran gibs par jurmaana lagaaya gaya
 The most notoriety came when Gibbs was found involved in a match-fixing affair with former captain Hansie Cronje
 Hansie Cronje offered him 15,000 dollars to score less than 20 runs in a third, one-day international series
 He wept during the King Commission inquiry, claiming that he was not involved in South African cricket corruption and that he never followed the deal on his behalf, despite scoring a brilliant 74 in that match
 As a result, he was banned for only six months
 Since then, he has repeatedly refused to visit India for fear of arrest and has also refused to talk to the Indian police in the matter
 However, Gibbs was part of the South African squad that visited India in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy
 His name was included, as a result he had to meet the Indian police in a match-fixing case
 15 janvari 2007 ko yah ghoshnaa kii gai ki, pakistan ke khilaaf pehle test ke dauraan naslvaadi tippanee karne ke kaaran, gibs ek anushaasanamak panel kaa saamana karenge

 aisa kaha gaya kii tippanee bheed main baithe un logon par kii gai thi, jinhone unke saathi khilaadi paul haris ko kshetrarakshan ke dauraan gaali di thi
 Pakistani managers officially complained to referee Chris Broad and Gibbs was banned for two Tests
 unhone is pratibandh ke khilaaf apil kii lekin, ICC ke aachaar samhita ayukta richi benaud ne ise naamanzur kar diya
 haalanki pratibandh ko ek test, ek twanti 20 match or ek vanade match tak simit kar diya gaya, jo sabhi pakistan ke khilaaf the

 amejan maanak pahchaan sankhya amezon dwaara prakashit pustakon kii bikri hetu di jane vaali pahchaan sankhya he
 Evasion is called evasion by individuals, business institutions, trusts and other groups by illegally adopting or giving false information or hiding the right information
 web sevaayen aajkal aksar aplicoshan programing interfaces yaa web API he, jinamein network jaise internet ke dwaara pravesh kiya ja saktaa he or duurastha pranali parichaarak par anurodhit sevaaon ko nishpadit kiya ja saktaa he| In general language, the term refers to the hypertext transfer protocol, protocol based communication between client and server on the web
 These types of services fall into one of these two categories: Big Web Services and restful Web Services
 "big web sevaayen" extencible markup bhashaa sandesh kaa upyog karti he jo ki simpal object acces protocol maanak kaa paalan karti he or paaramparik udhyam main lokapriy he| aisi pranaaliyon main, aksar seva dwaara pradaan kii janevaali kaary vidhi kaa mashin dwaara pathneey varnan hota he jo, web services discripshan language main likhaa hota he| baad vaali visheshta SOAP andpoint main aavashyak nahin he lekin yah kai java or 
NET SOAP ruparekha main yah swachaalit client-said code prastut karne ke liye zaruri he|, apache exis 2 or apache CXF jaise kai fremaworks isamen ullekhneey apwaad hai) WS-I jaisi, kuch audyogic sansthaae, web sevaaon kii apni paribhaasha main SOAP or WSDL donon kaa samavesh karti hai| Recently, repressational state transfer web services are gaining back popularity, especially with Internet companies
 With POST, they are often better integrated with HTTP and web browsers than soap-based services, using put, get, and delete HTTP methods
 They do not require XML messages or WSDL services-api definitions
 web API web sevaaon main bana hua hai jahaan simpal object acces protocol aadhaarit sevaaon se dur adhik pratyaksh repressentational state transafar style sanchaar kii ore jor diya gaya he| web apis maishap ke rup main jane jane vaale nae anuprayog main ekaadhik web sevaayen ke sangyojan ko anumati detaa hai| When used in the context of web development, the Web API is typically a group of request messages with a definition of a hypertext transfer protocol response message structure, usually in an extensible markup language or javascript object notation
 jab samgr web sevaayen chal rahi ho, prayek up seva swytt maani ja sakati he| upyogkarta kaa in sevaaon par koi niyantran nahin hota he| uparaant yah web sevaayen khud vishwasaneey nahin hoti, saath hi ya seva pradaata prayoktaaon ko notice die bina apni sevaaon ko band, badal yaa sudhaar kar sakate hai| vishwasaneeyata or dosha sahishnutaa achche se samarthit nahin kii jaati; dosha nishpaadan ke dauraan bhi ho saktaa he| web sevaaon se sambandhit ekshepshan handlling kshetra main ab bhi shodh jari he| The W3C defines 'web services' as "a software system connecting machines to interoperable machines on the network"
 It is an interface described in a machine-processed format
 Other systems interact with web services using the SOAP message defined by their description, typically used in conjunction with other web-standards of XML serialization with HTTP
 W3C yah bhi kahata he kii, "ham web sevaaon ko do pramukh virgon main nirdeshit kar sakate hai, rest-anuroop web sevaayen, jinamein seva kaa praathmik uddeshy web sansadhano ke XML nirupan ko ek samaan "stateles" operation ke set kaa upyog karke chalaanaa hota he; or arbitary web sevaayen, jisame seva kii swecchit kaary pranaaliyon ko dikhaa sakati he| To increase interoperability of web services, WS-I publishes profiles
 The profile is a set of key specifications in a special edition that also includes some additional requirements limiting the use of the main specifications
 WS-I use case and test tools to help profile compliant Web Services installations by publishing them as well
 WS is an editing web service
 web sevaaon kii kshamta ke vistaar ke liye kuch visheshtaayen viksit kii gayin hai yaa vartmaan main viksit kii ja rahi he| yah visheshtaayen aam taur par WS-* ke rup main sanderbhit kii ja rahi hai| yahan ek gaiyr sampurna WS-* nirdishtikaran kii sampurna suchi di gayin hai| Some of these additional features come from the W3C
 There has been a lot of discussion on the subject of the organization's participation in it, because the common web and semantic web norms appear to be difficult in web service overview
 This was recently revealed in February 2007, during the W3C Workshop on Web Services for Enterprise Computing
 Some participants have advocated the w3c's decision to withdraw from WS- * related work and focus on the original Web
 Web Services is a software system that places, publishes and adds to the Web using XML protocols | iske vipareet, OASIS main kai web seva vistaar kaa maanakeekaran kiya gaya he, jisame web sevaayen sansaadhan ruparekha or WSDM bhi shaamil he| Web services are a set of tools that can be used in many ways
 The three most common usage styles are RPC, SOA and REST
 RPC web sevaayen ek vitarit kaary padhdati kol interphes pesh karte hai jo ki kai developers se padvati he| aamtaur par, RPC web sevaaon kaa buniyadi ekam WSDL kaary pranali he| The first web service tool was focused on RPC and as a result this style is supported and widely expanded
 However, they are sometimes criticized for not connecting seamlessly, as it is often implemented directly from mapping services to language specific tasks
 Many vendors found this approach deadlocked and insisted RPC not to allow the basic profile of WS-I
 RPC ke jaisi hi kaaryastylee ke saath anya tareekon main object menagement group kaa kaaman object rikuest brokar architekchar, Microsoft kaa distributed object model yaa san microsystems kaa JAVA / remote methd invocation RMI shaamil hai| Web services can also be used to create architecture based on service-based architecture concepts, where the basic unit of communication is a message rather than a campaign
 These are known as 'message based services'
 SOA web sevaaon ko bade software vikritaon or udyog vishleshkon kaa samarthan hai| RPC web sevaaon se vipareet, luus kapaling adhik hone kii sambhaavna he, kyonki dhyaan antarnihit karyanvayan vivaran ke bajaay WSDL dwaara pradaan "kantrect" par hota he| Middleware analysts use enterprise service buses that use a combination of web services to create message-based processing and event-driven SOA
 An example of Open Source ESB is Mule and another is Open ESB
 antat, repressentational state transafar aise sanrachana kaa varnan karata he jisame HTTP yaa samaan ke protocol kaa upyog hota he jisame interfes ko jane maane maanak sanchaalan, post, put, delit ) main baadhya kar detaa he| yahan par dhyaan sandesh yaa abhiyaanon kii bajaay statephul sansaadhan ke saath baatcheet par he|rest par aadhaarit sanrachana, HTTP par SOAP sandesh kaa varnan karne ke liye WSDL kaa upyog kar sakati he, jo ek sankshepan ke vishuddh rup main SOAP par lagu kar sakate hai, yaa SOAP kaa istemaal kiye bina bhi banaaya ja saktaa hai| Version 2
0 of the WSDL provides support for adding all HTTP request methods
 No more posts) This therefore enables better implementation of restful web services
 However, support for this specification is still not enough in software development kits, which often provide tools only for WSDL 1
1
 web sevaayen do tarah se likhi ja sakati he: Critics of non-restful web services often complain that they are too complex and based on large software vendors or integrators rather than specific open source implementations
 Apache Axis and Apache CXF are open source implementations
 REST web seva developers kii mukhya chintaa yah he ki SOAP WS tulkits remote sampark ke liye nae interphes paribhaashit karne kaa kaam badi aasaani se kar detii hai, jo aksar WSDL se yaa java seva API, c # yaa VB code se nikalne ke liye aatmanirikshan par bharosa karti hai| yah charchaa kaa vishay rahaa he kii yah system kii bhangurta main baadha laa saktaa he, kyonki sarwar par ek chota sa parivartan alag WSDL or alag seva interfes main parinaam kar sakate hai| client said class jo ki WSDL or XSD seva vivaran se utpann kiya ja saktaa he aksar isi tarah SOAP andpoint ke ek vishesh sanskaran se judaa rahata hai or andpoint parivartan yaa client said SOAP stack sudhar se tut saktaa he| achche se roopaankit kiye hue SOAP andpoint is se grast nahin he, lekin abhi bhi samasya yah he ki har seva ke custom interfes ko har seva ke liye ek custom client kii aavashyaktaa hoti he| Concerns are expressed about the performance of web services due to the use of XML in the message format of web services and in the encapsulation and transport of SOAP and HTTP, but emerging XML parsing / indexing technologies, such as VTD-XML, xml-related performance issues
 Assures to take care of web sevaaon se sambodhit hone vaali samasyaon ko anya tareekon se suljhaayaa ja saktaa he, purvavarti or samakaleen donon upaay maujuud he| RMI kai ]middlaver / 0} system main se ek he jinako vyapak pravistaaran mila he| CORBA or DCOM jaise mahatvakankshi prayaason ne distributed object ko prabhavit karne kaa prayaas kiya, jisaki web seva implementation kabhi kabhi nakal karne kii koshish karte hai| More basic efforts are XML-RPC, a rehearsal of SOAP that is only rpc-worthy and involves the use of various forms of HTTP without SOAP

 For example, the dialing code for Guam is +1 followed by the area code 671 — not +671 or +1671
 Originally larger countries, such as France, were assigned two-digit codes and small countries, such as Iceland, were assigned three-digit codes; However since the 1980s all new assignments have been three-digit regardless of countries' sizes
 CCITT, the predecessor of the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector, developed the first formal list of telephone country codes
 This list was included in the 1964 CCITT Blue Book, among other international telecommunication recommendations, which would eventually become ITU-T recommendation E

 An earlier system of country codes for European use was mentioned in the 1960 CCITT Red Book
 Some of these country codes were retained in the CCITT country code assignments and remain in effect

 thyroid hormone koshikeey str par mahatvapurn he, jo sharir ke lagbhag har prakaar ke utak ko prabhavit karata he
 When the thyroid gland starts producing hormones in large quantities, the body starts using energy more than the quantity
 ise hyper thyrodism yaa avatu garnthi kii atisakriyata kehete hai
 This disease can happen to people of any age, however the ratio of female to male is five to eight times more than that of male

 If the thyroid gland works properly then the right amount of hormones required for the metabolism of the body will remain at a satisfactory rate
 jaise-jaise hormone kaa upyog hota rahata he, avatugranthi uski pratisthapana karata rahata he
 The thyroid gland controls the amount of hormones in the bloodstream by operating the pituitary gland

 The thyroid gland lasts a lifetime
 dhyanpurvak iske prabandhan se avatugranthi se peedit vyakti apana jivan swasth or saamaanya rup se ji sakate hai
 There are many reasons for hyperthyroidism
 adhikanshtah, sampoorn granthi thyroid hormone kaa ati-utpaadan karne lagati he
 This is called Graves' disease
 aam taur par kam maamalon main, atirikt hormone srav ke liye ek akeli granthika jimmedaar hoti he, jise "garm" granthika kaha jaataa he
 Thyroiditis can also cause hyperthyroidism
 anek naidanik sthitiyon main kaaryshil thyroid utak dwaara atirikt thyroid hormone kaa utpaadan kiya jane lagata he
 Following are the main reasons for this in humans: anek anya kaarnon se thyroid hormone kaa ucch rakt str ho saktaa he: Measuring levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone () produced by the mucous gland in the blood) is a preliminary test of particularly suspected hyperthyroidism
 ti kaa nimna str par vishisht rup se ingit karata he ki shlashmik granthi ko mastishk dwaara thyroid granthi ke uttejan main katautee karne ke liye rukaawat daali gayi he yaa "nirdeshit" kiya gaya he, jisase rakt main T4 or / yaa T3 ke staron main vruddhi hone lagati he
 Rarely, an inferior TSH indicates primary failure of the mucosa, or temporary blockage of the mucosa due to other disease, and therefore examination of T4 and T3 is still clinically useful
 grevs rog main prati-ti-abhigraahak rog-pratikaarak yaa hashimoto ke thyroditis main prati-thyroid-paroxides jaise vishisht rog-pratikaarakon ko maapne se bhi rog nidaan main yogadan ho saktaa he
 Blood tests confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, indicating a decrease in thyroid stimulation hormone levels and an increase in T4 and T3 levels
 ti mastishk main shlashmik granthi dwaara banaaya gaya ek hormone he, jo thyroid granthi ko bataata he ki kitna hormone bananaa he
 When thyroid hormone is very high, then TSH decreases
 radiodharmee iodine udgrahan pareekshan or thyroid scan donon atigalagranthita ke kaaran kaa charitra-chithran karte hai yaa radiologist or doctoron ko atigalagranthita ke kaaran ke nirdhaaran main sakasham banaate hai
 Empty stomach radioactive iodine injection is used during the levitation test to measure the amount of iodine absorbed by the thyroid gland or injected into the body by mouth
 atigalagranthita se grast vyakti bahut zyada iodine aatmsaat kar lete hai
 Specifically operated thyroid scan images in connection with the levitation test, allowing visual examination of the gland's hyperactivity
 atigalagranthita or thyroditis se aayi is beemaari ke charitra chithran ke liye thyroid cintigraphy ek upyogi pareekshan he
 This test system typically involves two interconnected tests: a iodine levitation test and a scan with a gamma camera
 The levitation test involves taking a single dose of radioactive iodine, specifically iodine-123 or 123I, as the most suitable isotopic of iodine for clinical studies of thyroid disease
 thyroid utak or thyroid cancer aparoopaantaran kii chhaviyaan banane ke liye I-123 lagbhag iodine kaa adarsh samasthanik he
 Typically, a tablet containing sodium iodide is swallowed by mouth, containing small amounts of iodine-123, possibly less than a grain of salt
 aam taur par goli nigalane se pehle do ghante or uske baad ek ghante tak upwas main rahanaa aavashyak he
 They are generally tolerated by these low doses of radioiodine that are otherwise allergic to iodine and cannot tolerate adverse medium containing large doses of iodine used in similar image-forming diagnostic systems)
 The body excretes excess radioiodine that cannot be absorbed into the thyroid gland by the urine
 kuch rogi naidanik radioiodine se halki allergic pratikraya kaa anubhav kar sakate hai or unhen histaminarodhi diya ja saktaa he
 The patient usually regains the level of radioiodine "levitation" 24 hours later, measured with an instrument connected to a metal spindle tied to the throat, measuring radioactivity emission from the thyroid
 is pareekshan main 4 minute lagate hai, tab tak mashin software ke dwaara udgrahan % sanchit hota he
 Typically, a scan is also performed, where images of the anomalous thyroid gland are taken from the gamma camera; The radiologist studies it and after examining the images produces a report mentioning the levitation% and giving his comment
 atigalagranthi ke rogi vishishtatya saamaanya se unche str kaa radioiodine "grahan karte" hai
 The typical range of RAI levitation is from 10–30%
 ti staron ke pareekshan ke alaava, anek doctor adhik vistrut parinaamon ke liye T3, free T3, T4 or / yaa free T4 ke bhi pareekshan karte hai
 Typical adult limits for these hormones are: TSH: 0
45 - 4
50 uiu / ml, T4 free / direct: 0
82 - 1
77 ng / dl; And T3: 71 - 180 ng / dl
 Individuals with hyperthyroidism can easily display these upper limits of T4 and / or T3 several times

 The following are the causes of hyperthyroidism maanav main atigalagranthita ke upachaar ke liye brihad or aam taur par sweekaarya roopaatmakataaon main damanaatmak thyrostetics upachaar kaa praarambhik asthaayee upyog shaamil he or sambhawatah baad main sthaayee shalya chikitsa yaa radio samasthanik chikitsa kaa upyog bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 All the pathways under active thyroid function can be the cause, which can be easily handled with levothyroxine supplementation
 thyrostetics dawaaen thyroid hormone ke utpaadan ko atakati hai, jaise ki karbimajol or methimajol or propylathuresil
 mana jaataa he ki thyrostetics thyroparoxides dwaara thyroglobulin ke iodinikaran ko rokane kaa kaam karata he or is tarah tetra-yodothyronin ke nirmaan ko roktaa he
 Propylthurasil also functions outside the thyroid gland, actively inhibiting the conversion of T3 into T3
 chunki thyroid utak aamtaur par thyroid hormone kaa ek bada sanchay rakhe hote hai, isliye thyrostetics ko prabhavi ho paane main kai saptaah lag jate hai or khuraaq ko praayah maheenon kii avadhi main titrate karne kii jarurat padati he, saath hi niyamit rup se doctoron kii dekhbhaal or parinaamon kii jaanch ke liye rakt pareekshan bhi karte rahanaa padataa he
 Initial treatment often requires a very high dose, but patients may develop symptoms of hyperactivity if a high dose is used continuously
 khuraaq kaa yah anumapank sahi dhang se kar paanaa mushkil he or isiilie kabhi-kabhi "baadha va pratisthaapan" kaa dhang apanaaya jaataa he
 In obstruction and replacement therapy, sufficient amounts of thyrostatics are taken to completely stop thyroid hormones, treating the patient as if he has complete hypothyroidism
 dhakdhaki, kampan or vyagrata jaise atigalagranthita ke aam lakshanon main se anek koshika satahon par beta adrinergik abhigrahakon main vruddhi dwaara bich-bachaav kiye jate hai
 Beta blockers, typically used in the treatment of high blood pressure, are drugs that counterbalance this effect, reduce palpitations associated with palpitations, and decrease tremor and anxiety
 is prakaar, atigalagranthita se peedit marij aksar tatkaal asthaayee raahat praapt kar sakate hai, jab tak ki upar bataaye radioiodine pareekshan se atigalagranthita kaa charitra chithran ho jaataa he or phir tab adhik sthaayee ilaaj shuru ho sakati he
 Note that these drugs do not treat its long-term effects due to hyperthyroidism or non-treatment, but only treat or alleviate the symptoms of the condition
 thyroid hormone ke utpaadan par kuch alpatam prabhaav tathaapi propranolol se bhi aata he -jiskaa atigalagranthita ke upachaar main do bhoomikaayen hoti hai, jo propranolol ke alag samavayavi padaarth dwaara nirdhaarit hota he
 L-propranolol is the cause of beta-inhibition, so it treats symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism such as tremor, palpitations, rash, and heat intolerance
 di-propranolol thyroxin deodinage kaa avrodh karata he, is tarah T3 main T4 ke roopantaran ko avaruddh karke kuch, haalanki alpatam prabhaav pradaan karata he
 Other beta blockers are used only to treat symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism
 america main propranolol or britain main metoprolol kaa istemaal aksar atigalagranthi ke marijon ke ilaaj main vruddhi karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Premature surgery is an option for reduced use of invasive radio isotopic therapy, but is still needed in cases where the thyroid gland is enlarged and causes pressure on the neck, or the underlying cause of hyperthyroidism
 Essentially cancer-related
 surgery kaa prayog vyapak rup se nahin kiya jaataa he, kyonki atigalagranthita ke sabase aam roopon kaa bahut prabhavakaari ilaaj radiodharmee iodine paddati dwaara kiya jaataa he or chunki parathyroid grathiyon ko nikaalane or aavartak laringial tantrika ke kaate jane se niglana mushkil ho jaataa he or kisi badi surgery se yahaan tak ki samanyikrut stavakgolanu sankraman ho saktaa he
 Some Graves' disease patients, however, can tolerate medications for this or that reason, patients who are allergic to iodine, or patients who refuse radioiodine may opt for surgery
 iske alaava, kuch sarjanon kaa maananaa he ki asaamaanya rup se badi granthi vaale, yaa jinaki ankhen kotor se baahar nikali hui hon, aise marijon ke liye radioiodine upachaar asurakshit he; bhay he ki radioiodine 131 kii bahut adhik khuraaq se marij ke lakshan bad ja sakate hai
 In iodine-131 radio isotopic therapy, radioactive iodine-131 is given through the mouth for one time to prevent or completely destroy the function of the hyperactive thyroid gland
 The isotopic use of this radioactive iodine for ablation treatment is more potent than clinical radioiodine, which has a biological half-life of 8–13 hours
 iodine-131, jo bhi beta kanon ko samaapt karata he jo simit kshetra main utakon ke liye kahin adhik nuksaankaree he, kaa lagbhag 8 dinon kaa arddh-jivan hota he
 Patients who are not affected by the first dose are sometimes given additional, larger doses of radio iodine
 is ilaaj main iodine-131 ko thyroid main sakriy koshikaon dwaara uthaa liya jaataa he or unhen nasht kar detaa he, thyroid granthi ko zyaadaatar yaa puri tarah se niskriy bana detaa he
 Since iodine is easily ingested by thyroid cells and even more readily by overactive thyroid cells, sleep destruction occurs locally and does not have widespread side effects of this therapy
 50 varshon se radioiodine anshochhedan kaa prayog ho rahaa he or iskaa upyog nahin karne kii ekmaatr badi vajah hai garbhavastha or stanpan 
 ek baar jab thyroid granthi niskriy bana di jaati he, tab sharir kii thyroid hormone kii maatra kii zarurat ko puraa karne ke liye pratidin munh ke jariye pratisthaapan hormone chikitsa aasaani se di ja sakati he
 However, a skewed study notes that the incidence of cancer was seen after radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism
 atigalagranthita ke liye radioiodine upachaar kaa pramukh laabh yah he ki aushadhi chikitsa kii tulana main isamen safalataa dar bahut adhik he
 Depending on the dose of radioiodine selected and the disease being treated, the success rate of the definitive solution for hyperthyroidism may vary from 75–100%
 grevs rogiyon main radioiodine kaa ek pramukh sambhavit dushprabhav ke rup main jivan bhar ke liye avatu-alpakriyata kaa vikaas he, jiske liye pratidin thyroid hormone ke ilaaj kii zarurat he
 Occasionally, some patients may require more than one radioactive treatment, depending on the type of disease, the size of the thyroid and the initial administered dose given
 anek rogi pehle is baat se dukhi hote hai ki unhen jivan bhar thyroid hormone kii goli leni padegi
 phir bhi, thyroid hormone surakshit, saste or aasaani se nigal lene vaale hote hai; or hormone thyroid ke jaise hote hai tathaa saamanytah thyroid dwaara hi bane hote hai; aam taur par yah chikitsa bahut adhikansh rogiyon ke liye atyant surakshit or bahut hi sahneeya he
 The destruction of thyroid tissue as a result of radioactive iodine treatment, often leads to a moving period of several days to weeks when symptoms of hyperthyroidism may actually worsen after radioactive iodine treatment
 thyroid hormone yukt thyroid koshikaon ke radiodharmee iodine-janit vinaash ke baad rakt main thyroid hormone ke jari hone se aamtaur par aisa hota he
 In some patients, drug treatments such as beta blockers may be useful in this period
 anek rogi shuruuaati kuch saptaah ko bina kisi samasya ke bardaasht karne main samarth hote hai
 Most patients did not experience any difficulty after radioactive iodine treatment, usually given as a small pill
 agar thyroid main halki sujan viksit ho or gardan yaa kanth kshetra main pareshaani paidaa kar rahi ho to kabhi-kabhi, kuch dinon baad gardan sukumaartha yaa gale kaa shoth prakat ho ja saktaa he
 It is usually temporary and is not associated with fever etc
 radiodharmee iodine upachaar ke baad jo mahilaayein stanpan karaati hai unhen kam se kam ek saptaah or sambhawatah adhik samay tak ke liye stanpan karana band kar dena chahie, kyonki radiodharmee iodine upachaar ke kai saptaah baad bhi radiodharmee iodine kii kuch maatra stan ke doodh main paayi ja sakati he
 a common result after radioiodine is hyperthyroidism, a change from thyroid dysfunction to easily treatable thyroiditis and 78% of those treating Graves' thyrotoxicosis, and 40% of those treated with polycystic gland, or toxic gland tumors alone
 it happens
 radioiodine kii badi khuraaq kaa prayog upachaar vifaltaa kii ghatnaon ko kam kar detaa he, ilaaj ke ucch pratisaad ke liye harjane ke rup main falswaroop avatu-alpakriyata kii oonchi dar adhikanshtah shaamil he, jiskaa hormone ilaaj jivan bhar karnaa padataa he
 Ultrasound scans showed increased sensitivity to the thyroid more uniformly than radioiodine therapy, which is due to the large cells that are converted to 81% hypothyroid, which is 37% higher than the normal scan appearance
 Huh
 atigalagranthita ke charam lakshanon ke saath thyroid storm upasthit hota he
 It is treated with aggression, with resuscitation measures including the above combinations, including: a thionamide such as methimazole, followed by venous beta blockers such as propranolol, an iodinated radiocontrast agent or iodine solution if a radiocontrast agent is not available

 According to some veterinarians, up to 2% of cats over the age of 10 have it
 1970 ke dashak main billiyon kii atigalagranthita par pehali report aane ke baad se yah rog ullekhneey rup se adhik aam ban gaya
 In cats, benign tumors seem to be a cause of hyperthyroidism, but research is ongoing to find out the cause of such tumors developing in those cats

 Several other factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease, such as mumps and iodine and selenium elements in the diet

 There are the same three treatment options used for humans in cats' hyperthyroidism
 Cats must be given medication for the rest of their lives, but less expensive options may be given to especially older cats
 radioiodine upachaar or surgery aksar atigalagranthita ko thik kar detii hai
 Some veterinarians prefer radio iodine treatment rather than surgery, as it does not carry the risk associated with anesthesia
 haalanki, billiyon ke liye radioiodine upachaar sabhi kshetron main uplabdh nahin he
 The reason for this is that this treatment requires nuclear radioactive expertise and facilities, since animals' urine, sweat, saliva, and feces remain radioactive for several days after radioactive treatment, so they usually have a total of three weeks
 Like an intimate patient, it is necessary to be kept in the hospital and needs its facilities
 Guidelines for radiation levels differ in different states; Some states, such as Massachusetts, are sent home with care instructions after being hospitalized for two days
 thyroid grathiyon main se ek ke prabhavit hone ke baad surgery kii ja sakati he; lekin surgery ke baad baaqi granthiyaan ati-sakriy ho ja sakati hai
 As far as people are concerned, one of the most common complications of surgery is vertigo

 When hyperthyroidism appears in dogs, it is due to over-supplementation of thyroid hormones during treatment with hypothyroidism
 lakshan aamtaur par gaayab ho jate hai jab khuraaq samyojit kii jaati he
 Sometimes dogs develop functional carcinoma in the thyroid; Mostly this is a very aggressive tumor that spreads very rapidly and translocates easily or spreads to other tissues and makes the prior diagnosis very weak
 jabaki surgery sambhav he, lekin yah aksar bahut kathin ho jaati he kyonki dhamniyon, grasanalee or shwaasanlee sahit utakon ke aas-paas punj failte jate hai
 It is possible to do this only to reduce the size of the mass, in this way, you will get relief from symptoms and get time for other treatment works
 yadi kisi kute ko saumy kriyaatmak carcinoma he, upachaar or rog kaa nidaan nahin kii he ki billi se alag he
 The only real difference is that dogs are asymptomatic, with the exception of an enlarged thyroid gland appearing as a sphere in the neck

 In those days when foreign invaders were destroying one city after another, 'pancham Nanak' Guru Ram Das Ji Maharaj built a holy city of Ramsar, now known as Amritsar
 guru ram das kaa janm chuunaa mandi, lahore main karthik vadi 2, samvat 1591 ko hua tha

 His grandmother brought him with her to the village of Basarke
 unhone basrke main 5 varshon tak uble hue chane bech kar apana jivan yaapan kiya
 Once Guru Amar Das Sahib, along with Ramdas Sahib's grandmother, came to Basarke on the death of his grandfather and he had a deep attachment to Ram Das Sahib
 ramdaas ji apni nani ke saath goindwal aa gayi evam vahiin bas gayi
 Here too, he started selling boiled gram for his daily bread and also participated in religious associations by Guru Amardas Sahib
 unhone goindwal sahib ke nirmaan kii seva kii
 Ramdas Sahib Ji was married to Bibi Bhani Ji, the daughter of Guru Amardas Sahib

 He had become very famous for his devotion and service
 guru amardaas sahib ji ne unhen har pahalu main guru banane ke yogya paaya evam 1 sitambar 1574 ko unhen ÷chaturth nanak' ke rup main sthapit kiya
 Guru Ramdas Ji laid the foundation of 'chak Ramdas' or 'ramdaspur' which was later called Amritsar
 is uddeshy ke liye guru sahib ne tung, gilwaali evam gumtala gaanvon ke jameendaaron se santokhsir sarovar khudwane ke liye jaminen kharidi
 Later, he stopped the work of Santoksar and devoted all his attention to digging the Amritsar lake

 Soon the new city began to shine due to being the center of international trade

 Guru Ramdas Sahib ji composed four char laavas for 'anand Karj' and put the Gurmat Maryada of simple marriage in front of the society
 is prakaar unhone sikh panth ke liye ek vilakshan vaivaahik paddati di
 Thus, this different matrimonial system drove the society away from orthodox traditions

 The Yeti or abominable snowman is a mythical creature and a monkey-like cryptid who reportedly inhabits the Himalayan region of Nepal and Tibet
 yeti or meh-teh naamon kaa upyog aam taur par kshetra ke mul nivasee karte hai, or yah unke itihaas evam puranic kathaon kaa hissaa he
 Yeti's stories first emerged in the 19th century as an aspect of Western popular culture
 vaigyanik samudaay adhikansh taur par sakshya ke abhaav ko dekhte hue yeti ko ek kinvadanti ke rup main mahatv dete hai, phir bhi yah kryptozoology ke sabase prasiddh praaniyon main se ek ke rup main kaayam he
 The Yeti can be considered a variant of the Bigfoot legend of North America
 yeti shabd tibeti: གཡའ་དྲེད་; vyli: g
ya' dred se vyutpann he jo tibeti: གཡའ་; vyli: g
ya' "rocky" arthath "chattani", "rocky place" arthath "chattani jagah" or "ber" arthath "bhaaluu" shabdon kaa ek mail he
 Pranavananda explains that the words "ti", "te" and "teh" are derived from the spoken word 'tre') which is the Tibetan word-form of plum, whose 'r' would be pronounced so slowly
 Is that it is almost inaccessible, thus it becomes "te" or "teh"
 himalay ke logon dwaara istemaal kiye jane vaale anya shabdon kaa anuwaad bilkul usee rup main nahin hota he, balki ye shabd puranic or mul nivasee vanya jivan ko sanderbhit karte hai: The Nepalese have various names for the Yeti, such as - "ban-manche" meaning "vanamanush" or "kangchenjunga Rachis" meaning "demon of Kanchenjunga"
 "ghrunit himmanav" padavi ko 1921 tak nahin gadha gaya tha, usee varsh leftinent karnal charles howard-bari ne alpine club or royal jeeographical socity ke sanyukt "everest riconisans expedishan" kaa netritv kiya jiskaa vrittant unhone mount everest da riconisans, 1921 main likhaa
 is pustak main howard-bari 21,000 feet main "lhakpa-laa" ko paar karne kaa ek vivaran shaamil karte hai jahaan unhen kuch aise padchihn mili jise dekhakar unhen laga ki ye "shaayad kisi bade se lambi dag bharne vaale shikari bhediye ke padchihn the jisane naram barf main dohare padchihn-maarg kaa rup dhaaran kar liya tha jo kuch-kuch nange pairon vaale aadmi ke pairon ke nishaan lag rahe the"
 ve yah bhi kehete hai ki unke sherpa pathpradarshkon ne unhen turant bataaya ki ye padchihn jarur kisi "barfon ke junglee maanav" ke honge jise unhone "metoh-kangmi" naam diya
 "metoh" kaa anuwaad "maanav-bhaaluu" or "kong-me" kaa anuwaad "himmanav" ke rup main hota he
 Confusion still exists between howard-bury's translation of the word "metoh-kangmi" and the term used in Bill Tillman's book Mount Everest, 1938 where Tillman describes the creation of the term "disgusting snowman" as "metch
" , Which cannot exist in the Tibetan language and used the words "kangmi"
 ek mithyaa naam ke rup main "metch" kaa ek or saboot landan vishvavidhyalay main skool of oriental and african studies ke tibeti bhashaa ke adhikari profesar david snellgrove ne diya he, jinhone "metch" shabd ko asambhav shabd maanate hue ise asweekaar kar diya kyonki "t-c-h" vyanjan varnon ko tibeti bhashaa main ekasaath joda nahin ja saktaa he
 The documents reveal that the word "metch-kangmi" derives from a source
 aisa suzav mila he ki "metch" bas "metoh" kii galat vartanee he
 The origin of the term "hideous snowman" is certainly colorful
 isaki shuruyaat tab hui jab shri henry newman, jinhone "kim" upnaam kaa istemaal karke kolkata main da statsman main ek lambe samay tak apana yogadan diya, ne darjeeling lautne par "everest riconisans expedishan" ke kuliyon kaa saakshaatkaar liya
 Newman probably mistranslated the word "metoh" to mean "disgusting" or "dirty" in place of the word "disgusting", perhaps due to artistic license
 jaisaa ki lekhak bill tillman varnan karte hai, " ne lambe arase ke baad da times ke liye ek patr main likhaa: puri kahani ek aisi aanandamay rachana lagi ki maine ise ek yaa do samachaarpatron ko bhej diya"

 Tombazi, a photographer and member of the Royal Geographical Society, writes that he saw a creature about 15,000 feet near the Zemu Glacier
 Tombazzi later wrote that he saw the creature for about a minute from about 200 to 300 yards
 "there is no doubt that his stature was exactly like that of a human being who was walking upright and occasionally stopping in between to break some dwarf Burush bushes
 yah barf kii tulana main kaala dikhaai diya or jahaan tak main samaj saktaa tha, isane kapade nahin pahane the
 "about two hours later, Tombazzi and his companions descended from the mountain and saw traces of the creature they described as" The design of these footprints was similar to that of a man's footprints, but the only difference was that this footprint
 It was six to seven inches long and four inches wide 


 There was no doubt that these marks were of a two-legged creature
 " 
 The interest of Westerners in Yeti increased dramatically in the 1950s
 In 1951, while attempting to climb Mount Everest, Eric Shippton took photographs of countless large marks in the snow, about 6,000 m above sea level
 These photographs have been the subject of intense scrutiny and debate
 kuch log tark dete hai ki ve yeti ke astitv ke sabase achche saboot hai, jabaki anya log daawey ke saath kehete hai ki ye nishaan ek sansaarik praani ke nishaan hai jo barf ke pighalane se vikrut ho gaye hai
 It should also be noted that Eric Shipton was a notoriously practical joker
