 Nowadays, two Puranas bearing the 'bhagwat' legend are available: at: in donon main puraana koti main kiski gananaa apekshit he ? is prashn kaa samaadhaan aavashyak he
 Finally, after reviewing it in various ways, it seems that Shrimad Bhagwat should be considered as Puran and it is appropriate to keep Devi Bhagwat in the category of Uppurana
 shrimadbhagwat devibhagwat ke swarupanirdesh ke vishay main maun he
 But Devi Bhagwat counts 'bhagavata' under the subpuras and itself under the Puranas
 devibhagapancham skandh main varnit bhuvankosh shrimadbhagwat ke pancham skandh main prastut is vishay kaa aksharsh: anukaran karata he

 The Bhagwat himself states- 'vidyavataan bhagavate pariksha' : bhagwat vidvatta kii kasuti he or isi kaaran tikasampatti kii drushti se bhi yah athulaneey he
 Scholars of various Vaishnava sects have advocated self-explanatory interpretations on Bhagavat for the subsistence and affirmation of their specific doctrine, in which some commentators are briefly mentioned here: bhagwat ke deshkal kaa yatharth nirnay abhi tak nahin ho paaya he
 In the eleventh wing, people drinking water from Dravidian rivers like Kaveri, Tamraparni, Kritamala, etc
 have been shown as devotees of Lord Vasudeva

 It is certain that Hemadri, eminent theologian and minister of Bopdev, Mahadev and King Ramachandra, in his 'chaturvarga Chintamani' has quoted many of Bhagwat's words, cannot be considered the author of Bhagwat

 With this, the creation of Bhagwat cannot be considered archaic by the seventh century
 nimnlikhit talika main kuch vidwaanon dwaara sujhaayaa gaya bhagwat puraana kaa rachanakaal diya gaya he- The influence of Bhagwat was very active in the rise of medieval Vaishnava sects and was particularly important in the rise of Krishna poems of the provincial languages of India

 Inspired by the narration, Radhakrishna has sung a beautiful keli in his various poems
 tamil, andhra, kannada tathaa malayalam ke vaishnav kaviyon ke upar bhi bhagwat kaa prabhaav bhi kam nahin he
 Bhagwat's spiritual outlook is of monotheism and devotion is devotional
 is prakaar advait ke saath bhakthi kaa samrasya bhagwat kii apni vishistataa he
 For these reasons, Bhagwat is considered to be the undercurrent of Kavyatrayi of Sanskrit along with Valmiki Ramayana and Mahabharata
 bhagwat main 18 hajaar shloke, 335 adhyay tathaa 12 skandh hai
 The leelavataras of Vishnu are described in its Sukumar language in its various wings

 is kala kaa prayog kai saanskrithik vividhtaon ke saath duniya bhar main dekha jaataa he
 Those who read palmistry are also commonly called palmists, palm readers, hand readers, palm analysts, or palm readers
 hastrekha shaastra ko aam taur par chhadam vigyaan mana jaataa he
 The information outlined below is in essence the main elements of modern palmistry, many of which explain the various lines often contradicting them and palmists are divided into various "schools"
 hastrekha shaastra kii jaden chini vijing,bharat main jyotish shaastra or roma bhavishyavetta se judi hui hai
 The Hindu sage Valmiki is believed to have written a book, the English translation of which would be titled "the Teachings of Valmiki Maharishi on Mail Palmistry" and contains 567 verses
 bharat se, hastrekha kala kaa china, tibet, misr, faras or europe ke anya deshon main prasar hua
 From China, palmistry spread to Greece, where Anaxagoras used it
 lekin, aadhunik hastrekha shastri aksar bhavishya karne vaali paaramparik takanic ko manovigyaan, sampurna nidaan, anumaan ke vaikalpik tareekon se bhi jodate rahe hai
 In palmistry, "reading" the palm of a person evaluates his character or future life
 vibhinn "linon" or "uthaan" yaa, ko padhakar anumaanath: unke sambhddha aakaar, gun or antarshakhaon ke sambandh main suzav diye jate hai
 In some customs, palm readers read fingers, fingernails, fingerprints and lines of a person's skin, skin texture and color, shape, palm shape and hand flexibility
 ek hastrekhavid aamtaur par vyakti ke 'pramukh haath' 
 hastrekha vigyaan kii kuch paramparaon main duusare haath ko vanshanugat yaa parivaar ke lakshanon ko dhaaran kiya hua yaa hastrekhavid ke brahmand sambandhi vishwaason par aadhaarit mana jaataa he, jisase ateet ke jivan yaa purv janm kii sharton ke bare main jaankaree milti he
 The roots of the basic framework for "classical" palmistry are rooted in Greek mythology
 hatheli or ungaliyon kaa prayek kshetra ek devi yaa devtaa se sambandhit he or us kshetra kii visheshtaayen vishay ke isi pahalu kii prakruti kaa sanket he
 For example, the ring finger Apollo is associated with the Greek god; The features of this ring finger are seen during the discussion of the subjects related to art, music, aesthetics, fame, money and harmony
 yadhyapi is baat par bahes hoti rahi he ki koun sa haath padhanaa behatar he, par donon kaa apana mahatv he
 It is customary to assume that the left hand represents the person's possibilities and the right is a display of right personality
 kuch kaa kahana he ki mahatv is baat kaa he ki koun sa haath dekha jaataa he
 "the future is seen with the right hand and the past with the left
 " "baayan haath bataata he ki ham kya-kya lekar paidaa hue hai or dahinaa dikhaata he ki hamane ise kya banaaya he
 "" The right hand is read by men, while the left hand of women is read
 " "baanyaa haath bataata he ki ishwar ne aapako kya diya he or daayan bataata he ki aapako is sambandh main kya karnaa he
 " lekin in sab kehane kii baaten hai, vritti or anubhav hi aapako behatar dhang se bataayegaa ki aakhir main koun sa haath padhanaa thik rahegaa
 Depending on the palmistry and type of reading them, palmists can see palm shape and finger lines, skin color and texture, fingernail texture, proportional shape of palm and fingers, prominence of knuckles and many other features of the hand
 hastrekha shaastra kii adhikansh dhaaraon main haath kii akritiyon ko 4 yaa 10 pramukh shastreey prakaaron main vibhajit kiya jaataa he or kabhi kabhi iske liye shastreey tatwon yaa visheshtaon kaa sahaara bhi liya jaataa he
 Character size of the indicated type of character haalanki bhinn-bhinn roopon ke baavjood sabase aam vargeekaran hi aadhunik hastrekhavid prayog karte hai
 It is easy to determine the dominating elements and nature in your own palm, the number of lines and the quality of the rows can also be included in the analysis of the shape of the hand
 hastrekha shaastra kii kuch paramparaon main, prithvi or jal haathon main kam or gahari rekhaaen hoti hai, jabaki vaayu or agni haath main or adhik rekhaaen dikh sakati hai, jinamein kam spasht paribhaasha hoti he
 Three lines are found in almost all hands and the palmists generally place the most emphasis on these
 yah rekha anguuthe ke upar hatheli ke kinare se nikalati he or kalai kii disha main mehrab kii shakl main badhati he
 This line is believed to represent a person's energy and strength, physical health and general well-being
 aisa bhi mana jaataa he ki jivan rekha durghatnaon, shaareerik chot, punarsthaapan sahit jivan main aane vaale badlaavon ko pratibimbit karti he
 Contrary to popular belief, modern palmists generally do not believe that the length of a person's lifeline is associated with a person's age
 atirikt mukhya rekhaon yaa roopon main shaamil hai: According to palmistry, this line provides a person with intensity of purpose or concentration towards an objective, whose nature is determined by the correct position of this line on the hand and any branches arising from it, which is a common case
 un haathon main, jinamein aisi rekha bina kisi shakha ke ekal chihn ke rup main maujuud hoti he, vah atyant gahan prakruti kii ore sanket karti he or vyaktiyon kii vishesh dekhbhaal kii jarurat hoti he
 The normal position of this line begins below the largest finger and normally ends where the heart line ends at the side of the hand under the little finger, indicating the average interests of the person and the depth of the temperament
 Purely determined by the direction of any branches originating from here
 hatheli ke upree aadhe hisse, jo ungaliyon turant neeche hota he, vyakti ke ucchtar yaa bauddhik swabhaav kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or hatheli ke nichalaa aadha hissaa vyakti ke swabhaav ke bhautikwaadi paksh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 If one of these half-sides is larger, which is determined by the central position of the main line or in this case by the single transverse palm line, the person exhibits a broader developmental aspect of nature
 haalanki yah ek aam siddhant he ki agar yah rekha apni saamaanya sthiti se neeche hoti he to isse gahan bauddhik swabhaav kaa sanket miltaa he, par agar yah apni saamaanya sthiti se upar hoti he, to ghor bhautikwaadi prakruti or hiton ko darshata he
 The direction of any branching originating from this line has a significant effect on this line, leading to appropriate modifications from the results defined above, and is based on the nature of the hand bulge
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi is rekha se ek shakha anguuthe ke bilkul vipareet chandramaa ke ubhaar par haath ke nichle kinare kii ore badhati he to yah sanket karata he ki vyakti bhavuk swabhaav or kaaphi hichkichanevaala he
 Other short lines: is tarah ke sach ko tark kii kasuti par kasne vaale log aksar hastrekhavidon ko kathith maansashasthri kii shrenee main rakhte hai, "cold reeding" naam kii takanic kaa prayog karte hai
 Cold reading is considered to be an exercise in which all types of line study, including palmists, have to appear before the psychologist
 ek thode vyapak rup se sweekaarya khoj ke mutabik hastrekha shaastra kii sateekta ko charitra vishleshan kii ek pranali ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he or abhi tak nirnaayak saboot nahin mila he ki hatheli kii rekhaon or vyakti ke charitra ke bich koi sambandh hota he
 Beyond that the analysis should decide on a logical basis whether a person is suffering from a chromosomal disorder or a certain proportion of statistical groups are associated with their scores
 jivan kaal yaa vyaktitv ke prakaar ke sambandh main hastrekhavid dwaara kiye gaye daavon ke samarthan main abhi tak koi nirnaayak aankada yaa tathy nahin paaya gaya he

 uske computer par gudh sandesh ke aane ke saath hi teen vicitra logon ke saath uskaa saamana hota he, jo use rahasyamay bhumigat haikar morphius ke paas le jate hai jo use metrics ke satya ko jaanane kaa prastaav detaa he: laal goli khaakar satya ko jane yaa neeli goli khaakar usee duniya main laut jaye jise vah jaanata he
 Neo approves the proposed red pill by eating and then finds himself in a fluid-filled pod where his body is joined by wires and ducts from a large mechanical tower with the same pod
 sangyojan ko viched kar diya jaataa he, morphius ke dwaara uske praan kii raksha kii jaati he tathaa use vahaan se dur uske hovercraft, nebucneizer par le jaaya jaataa he
 Neo's neglected physical body is revived and Morpheus explains the situation
 morphius nio ko suchit karata he ki yah 1999 nahin balki 2199 ke aasapaas kii avadhi he or maanavtaa 21veen sadi main srujit pragatisheel mashiinon ke khilaaf yuddh lard rahi he
 The sky has been covered with thick black clouds created by humans in an attempt to deprive them of the solar energy supply of machines
 mashiinon ko maanav jati ke urja ke saath nabhikeey sanlayan ke saath samvedit kiya jaataa he or baad main aganit logon ko pod main daalkar unke jaivvidyutiya tathaa sharir ushma ko sanchit kar use viksit kiya jaataa he
 The world in which Neo resides after birth is a type of metric that is an illusory simulated real structure of the world, as machines were built in 1999 to subdue the human population
 morphius tathaa uskaa jattha swatantra maanvon kaa samooh he jo dusron ko metrics se viyojit kar mashiinon ke khilaaf yuddh main apane jatthe main bhartee kar lete hai
 Within the metrics, they are able to use the information of the properties required to break the laws of physics within this clone and are given superhuman abilities
 morphius ko vishwaas he ki nio hi "sarvashaktimaan" he jo ek aisa vyakti he jiske bare main yah bhavishyavaanee kii jaati he ki vah metrics par apane aseem niyantran se yuddh ko samaapt kar saktaa he
 Neo is trained and made a member of the batch
 nio ke sar ke peeche ek socket hota he, jise pehle metrics se use sanyojit karne ke liye prayog kiya gaya tha, vah pratyaksh taur par uske mastishk main gyaan yaa jaankaree ko aplod karne kii anumati detaa he
 Thus, he learns a variety of martial arts and in a virtual reality like metrics boxing with Morpheus he demonstrates his kung fu art and impresses everyone with his agile pace
 parvarti prashikshan main nio ko metrics main vidyaman moolbhoot khataron se parichay karaayaa jaataa he
 Injuries received there continue to appear in the real world as well; If he is killed in the Matrix, his physical body will also die
 use agent kii upasthiti ke khatre se aagaah kiya jaataa he jo teevr or shaktishaalee sajiv computer program ke saath metrics se jude hue kisi bhi vyakti ke vaastavik sharir ko adheen kar lene kii kshamta rakhata he or jiskaa lakshya anukriti ke liye kisi bhi khatre ko khojkar vinasht kar dena he
 Morpheus is confident that if Neo fully understands his powers as "almighty" then no one will be able to confront him
 samooh metrics main pravesh karata he evam nio ko orekal naam kii ek mahila se milaataa he jisane sarvashaktimaan ke aane kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi
 She tells Neo that he has the boon to change the metrics but is waiting for something, possibly the next life
 uske vaktavyon se nio nio is nattejey par pahunchataa he ki vah sarvashaktimaan nahin he
 She further states that Morpheus blindly believes in Neo that he will sacrifice his life to save her
 hack kiye gayi telephone se vaapasi ke raste jo ki metrics se nikasi ke liye surakshit raste kaa kaary karata he, jis jatthe ko agent tathaa sweate tiimon dwaara hamale ke liye ghaat par laga diya jaataa he
 Agent Smith surrounds Neo but Morpheus becomes entangled with him and orders all the people to exit
 morphius swayan ko bandi hone detaa he taaki nio tathaa anya batch sake
 He later discovers that he has been betrayed by the crew member Cypher, who chooses a world full of ignorance rather than real-world difficulties, and so decides to hand over Morpheus in exchange for a permanent return to the Matrix
 is
 sifer haar jaataa he lekin usase pehle uski dhokhebaaji kii vajah se nio, trinity, tanks tathaa morphius ko chhodkar baaki sabhi chaalak sadasyon kii maut ho jaati he
 At that time Morpheus remains imprisoned in the government building within the matrix
 agent usase zlyon ke mukhya dwaar ke acces code ke sandarbh main jaankaree praapt karnaa chaahate he jo yatharth jagat main viyojit maanvon kaa bhumigat aashray he
 Neo and Trinity return to the Matrix and storm the government building to save their leader
 nio metrics ke anukul parivartan ke saath adhik aatmavishvasi tathaa parichit ho jaataa he or antat: ek agent dwaara us par chalaai gai goliyon se khud ko bachaa letaa he
 Morpheus and Trinity exit the metrics via the underground railway telephone, but before Neo can escape, Agent Smith surrounds him
 vah usase muqabla karata he or ant main smith ko haraa detaa he lekin agent ke duusare sharir ko grahan karne se pehle nikal bhaagta he
 As Neo rushes to another telephone evacuation in the middle of the city, he is chased by the agents while the "sentinel" machines accumulate at the neobooker's location in the real world
 nio ek nikasi tak pahunchataa he, lokin agent smith dwaara gher liya jaataa he or goli se maaraa jaataa he
 Trinity says softly to Neo's ear that he was told by the oracle that he would love the Almighty, indicating that he is Neo
 vah uske mrityu ko asweekaar kar detii he or use chuum leti he
 Neo's heart rate starts racing again, and within the metrics, Neo revives, the agents fire at him, but he stops them with one of his gestures, ordering them to stop
 nio metrics ko sanghatit hare sanket ke rup main pahchaanane main safal hota he jo ki yatharth he
 Agent Smith makes a final attempt to kill him, but his punches are effortlessly blocked and Neo kills him
 anya do agent vahaan se bhaag jate he or nio sahi samay par jahaaj ke iempi hathiyaar se centinel mashin ko vinasht karne ke liye yatharth jagat main laut aata he jisane pehle se craft ke yaan ko tod diya tha
 In a brief epilogue, Neo is shown intermingling with the Matrix, promising via telephone that he will show the captives in the Matrix that anything is possible
 vah phone rakh detaa he or anant akash main ud jaataa he
 The Matrix was a co-production of Warner Bros
 and Australian Village Roadshow Pictures, and nearly all of the scenes were filmed at Fox Studios in Sydney, Australia, as well as in the same city

 Directors' micro nudes from their hometown of Chicago, Illinois were incorporated through the microscopically placed picture of the Chicago celestial line, the city map, during a fight between Neo and Smith on the subway, known as the "loop
" Places such as Adams Street Bridge, Well and Lake, Franklin and Erie, State and Balboa and Wabash and Lake are shown as destinations of underground railways

 According to The Art of the Matrix, an entire scene of the film and several action sequences were removed before the final cut, which has not been screened to date
 vachovsky bhaaiyon ne is baat par dhyaan diya tha ki sabhi shaamil log film ke kathanak prishthbhumi ko samajhen
 For example, the book that was used to hide the disc in the first scene of the film, titled Simulacra and Simulation, a 1981 work by French philosopher Jean Baudrillard, required all the major characters and members to study
 film main, jis code main metrics swayan sankalit he, use bahudhaa nimnapravahit hare aksharon ke saath darshaya he
 The code includes half-width Kana letters and mirror images of Latin words and numbers
 ek drishy main, saafe kii ja rahi khidki par dhalakati barish kii buundon kaa 'pattern' is code ke sadrishy lagata he
 The film's production art has a distinctly green color within the inner view of the metrics placed bilaterally, while the use of blue is emphasized in the real-world scene

 The film is known for popularizing world effects such as "bullet time" which allows the viewer to view each scene with the camera moving around the scene at normal speed

 Each camera is a still picture camera, not a moving photo camera and only one frame is contributed to the video sequence
 jab tasviir ke shot movie main dekha jaataa he to darshak tri-aiami kshan ko dwi-aiami main dekhte he
 Watching this type of time slice movie gives a sense of real life like observing a statue from different angles simultaneously

 Some scenes in The Matrix portray a "time-slice" effect with perfectly static characters and objects
 film sampadan takneekon ne spasht camera moshan kii taralata ko sanvruddh kiya
 This effect was further elaborated by the Wachowski brothers and the Visual Impact Supervisor John Gayetta to create bullet time that incorporates temporal motion to move slower and at different speeds than to stabilize the entire scene
 maanex vijuel effects ke ejiniyaron ne triayami vishwlazeshan planning vidhi ko yantric rup se nishchit vichaaron ko adhik jatil prakriyaaon lekin ruchikar binduon main tabdeel kiya
 Fluidity and tactility were improved through the use of graphical interpolation, digital compositing and the advent of computer-generated real scenes

 The main purpose of the bullet time shots in The Matrix was to creatively demonstrate the brain's dominance over matter with a real camera

 The soundtrack of the film is composed by Don Davis
 unhone kaha ki film main darpan ko kai baar dekha jaataa he: neeli or laal goliyon ke pratibimb ko morphius ke chashme main dekha jaataa he; agenton dwaara nio ko capchar karne kii kriya ko trinity ke motorcycle ke peeche-dekhne ke darpan ke madhyam se dekha jaataa he; nio ek toote hue darpan ko apane aap thik hota hua dekhtaa he; pratibimb ke mudaav ko ek chammach ke rup main ko tedha kiya jaataa he; ek helicopter kaa pratibimb dikhaai detaa he jab yah ek gaganchumbi imaarat ke kareeb pahunchataa he

 Praising the film's description and its "astonishment of stunning images", Philip Strick commented in Sight & Sound, "if the Wachowskis made no claims of the originality of the message, they are shockingly innovative inventors of the method"
 Roger Ebert praised the film's visuals and idea, but disliked the focus of the third act of action

 Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky commented, "I ran out of metrics and i was thinking, 'what kind of science fiction movie can people make now?' The Wachowskis originally took all the great science-fiction ideas of the 20th century and wrapped them in an interesting pop culture sandwich that everyone in the world looked at with great enthusiasm

 In the early days of 1915, Atma Ram also visited Calcutta and Punjab and was associated with revolutionary underground there, including Yugantar
 Herambalal Gupta and German consul Chicagoans sent to Siam through German Germans Paul Paul Boehm, Henry Sachulat and Albert Vede arranged the operatives with the express purpose of training Manila Indians

 In Shanghai, KNIPPING, three officials of the German Consul General sent for training Peking and in addition arranged for a Norwegian agent to smuggle arms through the embassy guard Swatow
 However, the Thai Police high command, which was largely British, discovered these plans and Indian police infiltrated the plot through an Indian secret agent who was revealed the details by the Austrian charge d'affaires
 Thailand, although officially neutral, was allied closely with Britain and British India
 On July 21, the newly arrived British Minister Herbert Dering presented Foreign Minister Prince Devawongse with the request for arrest and extradition of Ghadarites identified by the Indian agent, ultimately resulting in the arrest of leading Ghadarites in August
 Only a single raid into Burma was launched by six Ghadarites, Another plan that was explored was to raid the penal colony in the Andaman islands with a German volunteer force raised from East Indies and release the political prisoners to raise an expeditionary Indian force that would threaten the Indian coast
 The plan was proposed by Vincent Kraft a German planter in Batavia who had been wounded fighting in France
 It was approved by the foreign office on 14 May, 1915, after consultation with the Indian committee, and raid was planned for Christmas Day 1915 by a force of nearly one hundred Germans led by a former naval officer von Müller was raised
 Knipping made plans for shipping arms to the Andaman islands
 However, Vincent Kraft was a double agent, and leaked details of Knippings plans to British intelligence
 His own bogus plans for the raid were in the meantime revealed to Beckett by "oren", but given the successive failures of the indo-german plans, the plans for the operations were abandoned on the recommendations of both the Berlin Committee and Knipping
 The Berlin Committee, through Ottoman Turkey, also established contact with Mahmud al Hasan of Tehrek e Reshmi Rumal
 This movement, led by the Deobandi Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi and Mahmud al Hasan, proposed a pan-islamic insurrection in the tribal belt of India with support from the Aghan Amir, the Ottoman Empire and Imperial Germany
 Ubaidullah proceeded to Kabul to establish contact with the Amir of Afghanistan while Mahmud al Hasan proceeded to Hijaz to establish contact with the Turkish Governor, Galib Pasha
 At Kabul, Ubaid Ullah decided that the pan-islamic cause would be best served by focussing on the Indian Freedom Movement
 Ubaidullah proposed that the Afghan Amir declare war against Britain
 Members of the Tehrek e Reshmi Rumal are known to have been active amongst Muslim troops along with Ghadarite agents in South Asia
 Attempts made by the Deobandis of Tehrek e Reshmi Rumal, to organise incursions from the western border of India from Persia, through Baluchistan, to Punjab
 Indian prisoners of war from France, Turkey, Germany, and Mesopotamia—especially Basra, Bushehr, and Kut al Amara—were recruited, raising the Indian Volunteer Corps that fought with Turkish forces in a number of fronts
 The Indians were led by Amba Prasad Sufi, who during the war was joined by Kedar Nath Sondhi, Rishikesh Letha and Amin Chaudhry
 These Indian troops were involved in the capture of the frontier city of Karman and the detention of the British consul there, and also successfully harassed Percy Sykes' Persian campaign against the Baluchi and Persian tribal chiefs who were aided by the Germans
 The Aga Khan's brother was killed while fighting the rebels
 The rebels successfully harassed British Forces in Sistan in Afghanistan, confining British forces to Karamshir in Baluchistan, and later moving towards Karachi
 Some reports indicate they took control of the coastal towns of Gawador and Dawar
 The Baluchi chief of Bampur, having declared his independence from British rule, also joined the Ghadarites
 It was not before the war in Europe turned for the worse for Turkey and Baghdad was captured by the British forces that the Ghadarite forces, their supply lines starved, were finally dislodged
 They retreated to regroup at Shiraz, where they were finally defeated after a bitter fight during the siege of Shiraz
 Amba Prasad Sufi was killed in this battle
 The Ghadarites carried on guerrilla warfare along with Iranian partisans until 1919
 Meanwhile, the Germans sent a diplomatic mission to attempt to rally the Afghan Amir to the Central war effort
 The mission was headed by Oskar von Niedermayer and included Werner Otto von Hentig, the German diplomatic representative to Kabul, as well as Barkatullah and other prominent nationalists from the Berlin Committee
 Officially headed by Raja Mahendra Pratap, the mission also had representatives the Ottoman Empire, including Kasim Bey
 The mission established contacts with the tribes of the indo-iranian border and encouraged them to strike against British interests
 This mission was met by Ubaidullah Sindhi's group at Kabul in December 1915
 Along with bringing members of the Indian movement right to India's border, it also brought messages from the Kaiser, Enver Pasha and the displaced Khedive of Egypt, Abbas Hilmi, expressing support for Pratap's mission and inviting the Amir to move against India
 The immediate aim was to rally the Amir against British India and to obtain from the Afghan government a right of free passage
 Although the Amir refused to commit to or against the German proposals at the time, it found support among the Amir's immediate and close political and religious advisory group, including his brother Nasrullah Khan, his sons Inayatullah Khan and Amanullah Khan, as well as religious leaders and tribesmen
 It also found support in one of Afghanistan's most influential newspapers, the Siraj al-akhbar, whose editor Mahmud Tarzi took Barkatullah as an officiating editor in early 1916
 Tarzi published a series of inflammatory articles by Raja Mahendra Pratap, as well as increasingly anti- British and pro-central articles and propaganda
 By May 1916, the tone in the paper was considered serious enough for the Raj to intercept the copies to India
 By the end of 1916, hopes of the Amir's support were nearly non-existent
 Nonetheless, the Provisional Government of India was formed in Kabul December 1916 to emphasise to the Amir the seriousness of intent and purpose of the Germans and the Indians
 The government had Raja Mahendra Pratap as President, Barkatullah as Prime Minister, Ubaid al Sindhi as the Minister for India, Maulavi Bashir as War Minister, and Champakaran Pillai as Foreign Minister
 The provisional Government found support from Enver Pasha, proclaiming Jihad against Britain
 It also attempted to obtain support from Tsarist Russia, Republican China, and Japan and after the February Revolution in Russia in 1917, Pratap's government corresponded with the nascent Soviet government
 In 1918, Mahendra Pratap met Trotsky in Petrograd before meeting the Kaiser in Berlin, urging both to mobilise against British India
 Under pressure from the British, Afghan cooperation was withdrawn and the mission closed down
 However, the mission, and its offers and liaisons at the time, had profound impact on the political and social situation in the country, starting a process of political change that ended with the assassination of Habibullah in 1919 and the transfer of power to Nasrullah and subsequently Amanullah, precipitating the Third anglo-afghan War that led to Afghan Independence
 By the end of 1917, divisions had begun appearing between the Ghadar Party in America on the one hand, and the Berlin Committee and the German high command on the other
 Reports from German agents working with Ghadarites in Southeast Asia and the United States clearly indicated to the European wing a significant element of disorganization, as well as unrealism in gauging public mood and support within the Ghadarite organization
 The failure of the February plot, the lack of bases in Southeast Asia following China's participation in the war in 1917, and the problems of supporting a Southeast Asian operation through the sea stemmed the plans significantly
 Infiltration by British agents, change in American attitude and stance, and the changing fortunes of the war meant the massive conspiracy for revolution within India never succeeded
 One of the last events linked to the conspiracy derives from the Irish involvement when, on 28 June 1920, units of the Connaught Rangers mutinied at Jullundur in Punjab
 The anglo-irish War had already begun in Ireland with German support, to which the British government responded with large scale troop deployments
 The most infamous of these were the Black and Tans and the Auxiliary Division
 The news of atrocities by these units, upon reaching India, was instrumental in triggering a mutiny in the 1st Battalion of the Connaught Rangers
 Five men from c Company refused to take orders from their officers, declaring their intent not to serve the King until British forces left Ireland
 The Union Flag at Jullundur was replaced by the flag of the Irish Republic
 This mutiny was suppressed within three days and the mutineers imprisoned at Dagshai
 However, rumours of execution of the prisoners led to the spread of unrests
 atsolan, Private James Daly led about 70 Rangers in mutiny and tried to storm the armoury, which the loyal guard successfully defended
 Two mutineers were shot dead while others were taken prisoner
 In all, about 400 men joined the mutiny, of whom eighty-eight were court martialled
 Fourteen were sentenced to death and the rest given up to 15 years in gaol
 a few were acquitted
 Thirteen of the men sentenced to die had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment
 21-year-old Daly was shot by a firing squad in Dagshai prison on November 2, 1920; he was the last member of British Forces to be executed for mutiny
 Daly and John Miranda were buried at the Dagshai graveyard
 Outlines and nascent ideas of the conspiracy began to be noted and tracked by British intelligence as early as 1911
 Incidents like the delhi-lahore Conspiracy and the Komagata Maru incident had already alerted the CID of the existence of a large-scale network and plans for pan-indian militant unrest
 Measures were taken which focussed on Bengal — the seat of the most intense revolutionary terrorism at the time — and on Punjab, which was uncovered as a strong and militant base in the wake of Komagata Maru
 Har Dayal's extant group was found to have strong links with Rash Behari Bose, and were "cleaned up" in the wake of the Delhi bomb case
 At the outbreak of the war, Punjab CID sent teams to Hong Kong to intercept and infiltrate the returning Ghadarites, who often made little efforts to hide their plans and objectives
 These teams were successful in uncovering details of the full scale of the conspiracy, as well as discovering Har Dayal's whereabouts
 Immigrants returning to India were double checked against a list of revolutionaries
 In Punjab, the CID, although aware of possible plans for unrest, was not successful in infiltrating the conspiracy for the mutiny until February 1915
 a dedicated force was formed, headed by the Chief of Punjab CID, and including amongst its members Liaqat Hayat Khan 
 In February that year, the CID was successful in recruiting the services of one Kirpal Singh to infiltrate the plan
 Singh, who had a Ghadarite cousin serving in the 23rd Cavalry, was able to infiltrate the leadership, being assigned to work in his cousin's regiment
 Singh was soon under suspicion of being a spy, but was able to pass on the information regarding the date and scale of the uprising to British Indian intelligence
 As the date for the mutiny approached, a desperate Rash Behari Bose brought forward the D-day to the evening of 19 February, which was discovered by Kirpal Singh on the very day
 No attempts were made by the Ghadarites to restrain him, and he rushed to inform Liaqat Khan of the change of plans
 Ordered back to his station to signal when the revolutionaries had assembled, Singh was detained by the would-be mutineers, but managed to make good his escape under the cover of answering the call of nature
 The role of German or baltic-german double-agents, especially the agent named Oren, was also important in infiltrating and preempting the plans for Autumn rebellions in Bengal in 1915 as well as scuttling Bagha Jatin's plans in winter that year
 Another source was the German double agent Vincent Kraft, a planter from Batavia, who passed information about arms shipments from Shanghai to British agents after being captured
 Kraft later fled through Mexico to Japan where he was last known to be at the end of the war
 Later efforts by Mahendra Pratap's Provisional Government in Kabul were also compromised by Herambalal Gupta after he defected in 1918 and passed on information to Indian intelligence
 By the time the war broke out the Indian Political Intelligence Office, headed by John Wallinger, had expanded into Europe
 In scale this office was larger than those operated by the British War Office, approaching the European intelligence network of the Secret Service Bureau
 This network already had agents in Switzerland against possible German intrigues
 After the outbreak of the war Wallinger, under the cover of an officer of the British General Head Quarters, proceeded to France where he operated out of Paris, working with the French Political Police, the Sûreté
 Among Wallinger's recruits in the network was Somerset Maugham, who was recruited in 1915 and used his cover as author to visit Geneva while avoiding Swiss interference
 Among other enterprises, the European intelligence network attempted to eliminate some of the Indian leaders in Europe
 a British agent called Donald Gullick was dispatched to assassinate Virendranath Chattopadhaya while the latter was on his way to Geneva to meet Mahendra Pratap to offer Kaiser Wilhelm ii's invitation
 It is said that Somerset Maugham based a number of his stories on his first-hand experiences, modeling the character of John Ashenden after himself and Chandra Lal after Virendranath
 The short story of Giulia Lazzari is a blend of Gullick's attempts to assassinate Virendranath and Mata Hari's story
 Winston Churchill advised advised Maugham to burn 14 other stories

 The Czech revolutionary network in Europe also had a role in the uncovering of Bagha Jatin's plans
 The network was in touch with the members in the United States, and may have also been aware of and involved in the uncovering of the earlier plots
 The American network, headed by E
V
 Voska, was a counter-espionage network of nearly 80 members who, as Habsburg subjects, were presumed to be German supporters but were involved in spying on German and Austrian diplomats
 Voska had began working with Guy Gaunt, who headed Courtenay Bennett's intelligence network, at the outbreak of the war and on learning of the plot from the Czech European network, passed on the information to Gaunt and to Tomáš Masaryk who further passed on the information the American authorities
 In the Middle East, British counter-intelligence was directed at increasing the loyalty of the Indian sepoy in the face of Turkish propaganda and the concept of the Caliph's Jihad, while a particularly significant effort was directed at intercepting the Kabul Mission
 In the United States, the conspiracy was successfully infiltrated by British intelligence through both Irish as well as Indian channels
 The activities of Ghadar on the Pacific coast were noted by W
 C
 Hopkinson, who had grown up in India and spoke fluent Hindi
 Initially W
C
H
 had been despatched from Calcutta to keep the Indian Police informed about the doings of Taraknath das
the Home department of the British Indian government had begun the task of actively tracking Indian seditionists on the East Coast as early as 1910
 Francis Cunliffe Owen, the officer heading the Home Office agency in New York, had become thoroughly acquainted with George Freeman alias Fitzgerald and Myron Phelps, the famous New York advocate, as members of the clan-na-gael
 Owens' efforts were successful in thwarting the SS Moraitis plan
 The Ghadar Party was incidentally established after Irish Republicans, sensing infiltration, encouraged formation of an exclusively Indian society
 Following this, a number of approaches were adopted, including infiltration through a "native" Indian intelligence officer by the name of Bela Singh who successfully set up a network of agents passing on information to British intelligence, as well as the use of the famous American Pinkerton's detective agency
 W
 C
 Hopkinson himself was assassinated in a court in Victoria by a Ghadarite called Mewa Singh in October 1914
an Irish double agent by the name of Charles Lamb is said to have passed on the majority of the information that compromised the Annie Larsen and ultimately helped the construction of the prosecution
 An Indian operative, codenamed "C" and described most likely to have been the adventurous Chandra Kanta Chakravarty, also passed on the details of the conspiracy to British and American intelligence
 The conspiracy led to a number of trials in India, most famous among them being the Lahore Conspiracy trial, which opened in Lahore in April 1915 in the aftermath of the failed February mutiny
 Other trials involved the Benares, Simla, Delhi, and Ferozepur conspiracy cases, and the trials of those arrested at Budge Budge
 At Lahore, a special tribunal was constituted under the Defense of India Act 1915 and a total of 291 conspirators were put on trial
 Of these 42 were awarded the death sentence, 114 transported for life, and 93 awarded varying terms of imprisonment
 a number of these were sent to the Cellular Jail in the Andaman
 Forty two defendants in the trial were acquitted
 The Lahore trial directly linked the plans made in United States and the February mutiny plot
 Following the conclusion of the trial, In the United States, the Hindu German Conspiracy trial commenced in the District Court in San Francisco on November 12 1917 following the uncovering of the Annie Larsen affair
 One hundred and five people participated, including members of the Ghadar Party, the former German consul-general and vice-consul, and other members of staff of the German consulate in San Francisco
 The trial itself lasted from November 20 1917 to April 24 1918
 The last day of the trial was notable for the sensational assassination of the chief accused, Ram Chandra, by a fellow defendant, Ram Singh, in a packed courtroom
 Singh himself was immediately shot dead by a US Marshal
 In May 1917, eight Indian Nationalists of the Ghadar Party were indicted by a federal grand jury on a charge of conspiracy to form a military enterprise against Britain
 In later years the proceedings were criticised as being a largely show trial designed to preempt any suggestions that the United States was joining an Imperialist war
 The jury during the trial was carefully selected to exclude any Irish person with republican views or associations
 Strong public support in favour of the Indians, especially the revived Anglo-phobic sentiments following the colonial provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, allowed the Ghadarite movement to revive despite British concerns
 The conspiracy had a significant impact on Britain's policies, both within the empire and in international relations
 The outlines and plans for the nascent ideas of the conspiracy were noted and tracked by British intelligence as early as 1911
 Alarmed at the agile organization, which repeatedly reformed in different parts of the country despite being subdued in others, the chief of Indian Intelligence Sir Charles Cleveland was forced to warn that the idea and attempts at pan-indian revolutions were spreading through India "like some hidden fire"
 a massive, concerted, and coordinated effort was required to subdue the movement
 Attempts were made in 1914 to prevent the naturalisation of Tarak Nath Das as an American citizen, while successful pressure was applied to have Har Dayal interned
 The conspiracy, judged by the British Indian Government's own evaluation at the time, and those of a number of contemporary and modern historians, was an important event in the Indian independence movement and was one of the significant threats faced by the Raj in the second decade of the 20th century
 In the scenario of the British war effort and the threat from the militant movement in India, it was a major factor for the passage of the Defense of India Act of 1915
 Among the strongest proponents of the act was Michael o'dwyer, then the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, and this was largely due to the Ghadarite movement
 It was also a factor that guided British political concessions as well as Whitehall's India policy during and after World War I, including the passage of montagu-chelmsford Reforms which initiated the first round of political reform in the Indian subcontinent in 1917
 The events of the conspiracy during World War I, the presence of Pratap's Kabul mission in Afghanistan and its possible links to Bolshevik Russia, as well as a still active revolutionary movement especially in Punjab and Bengal led to the appointment of a sedition committee in 1918 chaired by Sydney Rowlatt, an English judge
 It was tasked to evaluate German and Bolshevik links to the militant movement in India, especially in Punjab and Bengal
 On the recommendations of the committee, the Rowlatt Act, an extension of the defense of India act of 1915, was enforced in India 

 The events that followed the passage of the Rowlatt Act in 1919 were also influenced by the conspiracy
 At the time, British Indian Army troops were returning from the battlefields of Europe and Mesopotamia to an economic depression in India
 The attempts of mutiny in 1915 and the Lahore conspiracy trials were still in public attention
 News of young Mohajirs who fought on behalf of the Turkish Caliphate and later fought in the ranks of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War was also beginning to reach India
 The Russian Revolution had also cast its long shadow into India
 It was at this time that Gandhi, until then relatively unknown in the Indian political scene, began emerging as a mass leader
 Ominously, in 1919, the third anglo-afghan war began in the wake of Amir Habibullah's assassination and institution of Amanullah in a system blatantly influenced by the Kabul mission
 In addition, in India, Gandhi's call for protest against the Rowlatt act achieved an unprecedented response of furious unrest and protests
 The situation especially in Punjab was deteriorating rapidly, with disruptions of rail, telegraph and communication systems
 The movement was at its peak before the end of the first week of April, with some recording that "practically the whole of Lahore was on the streets, the immense crowd that passed through Anarkali was estimated to be around 20,000
" In Amritsar, over 5,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh
 This situation deteriorated perceptibly over the next few days
 Michael o ' Dwyer is said to have been of the firm belief that these were the early and ill-concealed signs of a conspiracy for a coordinated uprising around May, on the lines of the 1857 revolt, at a time when British troops would have withdrawn to the hills for the summer
 The Amritsar massacre, as well as responses preceding and succeeding it, contrary to being an isolated incident, was the end result of a concerted plan of response from the Punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy
 James Houssemayne Du Boulay is said to have ascribed a direct relationship between the fear of a Ghadarite uprising in the midst of an increasingly tensed situation in Punjab, and the British response that ended in the massacre

 Lastly, British efforts to downplay and disguise the nature and impact of the revolutionary movement at this time also resulted in a policy designed to strengthen the moderatist movement in India, which ultimately saw Gandhi's rise in the Indian movement
 The conspiracy influenced a number of aspects of Great Britain's international relations, most of all anglo-american relations during the war, as well as, to some extent, anglo-chinese relations
 After the war, it was one of the issues that influenced anglo-japanese relations
 At the start of the war, the American government's refusal to check the Indian seditionist movement was a major concern for the British government
 By 1916, a majority of the resources of the American department of the British Foreign Office were related to the Indian seditionist movement
 Before the outbreak of the war, the political commitments of the Wilson Government,, and the political fallouts of the perception of persecution of oppressed people by Britain prevented the then ambassador cecil-spring Rice from pressing the issue diplomatically
 After Robert Lansing replaced Bryan as Secretary of State in 1916, Secretary of State for India Marquess of Crewe and Foreign Secretary Edward Grey forced spring-rice to raise the issue and the evidences obtained in Lahore Conspiracy trial were presented to the American Government in February
 The first investigations were opened in America at this time with the raid of the Wall Street office of Wolf von Igel, resulting in seizures of papers that were later presented as evidence in the Hindu German conspiracy trial
 However, a perceptibly slow and reluctant American investigation triggered an intense neutrality dispute through 1916, aggravated by belligerent preventive measures of the British far-eastern fleet on the high seas that threatened the sovereignty of American vessels
 Seizure of German and Turkish passengers from the American vessel China by the 'HMS Laurentic at the mouth of the Yangtze River, followed by a number of incidents including the SS Henry S, which were defended by the British government on grounds that the seized ship planned to foment an armed uprising in India, drew strong responses from the US government, prompting the U
 S
 Atlantic Fleet to dispatch Destroyers to the Pacific to protect the sovereignty of American vessels
 Authorities in the Philippines were more cooperative, which assured Britain of knowledge of any plans against Hong Kong
 The strained relations were relaxed in May 1916 when the Britain released the China prisoners and released relaxed its aggressive policy seeking cooperation with the United States
 However, diplomatic exchanges and relations did not improve before November that year
 The conspiracy issue was ultimately addressed by William GE Wiseman, head of British intelligence in the United States, when he passed details of a bomb plot directly to the New York Police bypassing diplomatic channels
 This led to the arrest of Chandra Kanta Chuckrevarty
 As the links between Chuckervarty's papers and the Igel papers became apparent, investigations by federal authorities expanded to cover the entire conspiracy
 Ultimately, the United States agreed to forward evidence so long as Britain did not seek admission of liability for breaches of neutrality
 At a time that diplomatic relations with Germany were deteriorating, the British Foreign Office directed its Embassy to cooperate with the investigations resolving the anglo-american diplomatic disputes just as the United States entered the war
 Through 1915-16, China formed one of the major bases for the conspirators, and significant efforts were made by the British government to coax China into the war to attempt to control the German and Ghadar intrigues
 This would also allow free purchase of arms from China for the Entente powers
 However, Yuan's proposals for bringing China into the war were against Japanese interests and gains from the war
 This along with Japanese support for Sun Yat Sen and rebels in southern China laid the foundations for deterioration of anglo-japanese relations as early as 1916
 After the end of the Great War, Japan increasingly became a haven for radical Indian nationalists in exile, who were protected by patriotic Japanese societies
 Notable among these were Rash Behari Bose, Tarak Nath Das, and a m Sahay
 The protections offered to these nationalists effectively prevented British efforts to repatriate them and became a major policy concern
 The IIC was formally disbanded in November 1918, with most of its members becoming closely associated with Communism and the Soviet Union
 Bhupendranath Dutta and Virendranath Chattopadhyay alias Chatto arrived in Moscow in 1920
 Narendranath Bhattacharya, under a new identity of MN Roy, was among the first Indian communists and made a memorable speech in the second congress of the Communist International that rejected Leninist views and foreshadowed Maoist peasant movements
 Chatto himself was in Berlin until 1932 as the general secretary of the League Against Imperialism and was able to convince Nehru to affiliate the Indian National Congress with the league in 1927
 He later fled Nazi Germany for Soviet Russia but disappeared in 1937 under Stalin's Great Purge 
 The Ghadar Party, suppressed during the war, revived itself in 1920 and openly declared its communist beliefs
 Although sidelined in California, it remained relatively stronger in East Asia, where it allied itself with the Chinese Communist Party
 Although the conspiracy failed during World War i and the movement was suppressed at the time with a number of its key leaders hanged or incarcerated, a number of prominent Ghadarites also managed to flee India to Japan and Thailand
 The concept of a revolutionary movement for independence also found a revival amongst later generation Indian leaders, most notably Subhas Chandra Bose who, towards the mid-1930s, began calling for a more radical approach towards colonial domination
 During World War II, a number of these leaders were instrumental in seeking Axis support to revive such a concept
 Bose himself, from the very beginning of World War II, actively evaluated the concept of revolutionary movement against the Raj, interacting with Japan and subsequent escaping to Germany to raise an Indian armed force, the Indische Legion, to fight in India against Britain
 He would later return to Southeast Asia to take charge of the Indian National Army which was formed following the labor of exiled nationalists, efforts from within Japan to revive a similar concept, and the direction and leadership of people like Mohan Singh, Giani Pritam Singh, and Rash Behari Bose
 The most famous of these saw the formation of the Indian Independence League, the Indian National Army and ultimately the Arzi hukumat-e-azad Hind in Southeast Asia
 The Ghadar Memorial Hall in San Francisco honours members of the party who were hanged following the Lahore conspiracy trial, and the Ghadar Party Memorial Hall in Jalandhar, Punjab commemorates the Ghadarites who were involved in the conspiracy
 a number of those executed during the conspiracy are today honoured in India
 Kartar Singh is honoured with a memorial at his birthplace of the Village of Sarabha
 The Ayurvedic Medicine College in Ludhiana is also named in his honour
 The Indian government has produced stamps honouring a number of those involved in the conspiracy, including Har Dayal, Bhai Paramanand, and Rash Behari Bose
 a number of other revolutionaries are also honoured through India and the Indian American population
a memorial plaque commemorating the Komagata Maru was unveiled by Jawaharlal Nehru at Budge Budge in Calcutta in 1954, while a second plaque was unveiled in 1984 at Gateway Pacific, Vancouver by the Canadian government
 The ship itself is today maintained by the Komagata Maru heritage foundation
 In Singapore, two memorial tablets at the entrance of the Victoria Memorial Hall and four plaques in St Andrew's Cathedral commemorate the British soldiers and civilians killed during the Singapore mutiny
in Ireland, a memorial at the Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin commemorates the dead from the Jalandhar mutiny of the Connaught Rangers
 The conspiracy is known under a number of different names, including the Hindu Conspiracy, the indo-german Conspiracy, the Ghadar conspiracy, or the German plot
 The term hindu-german Conspiracy is closely associated with the uncovering of the Annie Larsen plot in the United States, and the ensuing trial of Indian Nationalists and the staff of the German Consulate of San Francisco for violating American neutrality
 The trial itself was called the hindu-german Conspiracy trial, and the Conspiracy was reported in the media as hindu-german Conspiracy
 However, the Conspiracy involved not only Hindus and Germans, but also substantial numbers of Muslims and Punjabi Sikhs as well, along with strong Irish support that pre-dated German and Turkish involvement
 The term Hindu was commonly used in opprobrium in America to identify Indians regardless of religion
 Likewise, conspiracy was also a negative term
 The term Hindu Conspiracy was used by the government to actively discredit the Indian revolutionaries
 The term Ghadar Conspiracy may also refer more specifically to the mutiny planned for February 1915 in India
 The term German plot may also refer more specifically to the plans for shipping arms to Jatin Mukherjee in Autumn 1915
 The term indo-german conspiracy is also commonly used to refer to later plans in Southeast Asia and to the mission to Kabul which remained the remnant of the conspiracy at the end of the war
 All of these were parts of the larger conspiracy
 Most scholars reviewing the American aspect use the name hindu-german Conspiracy, the hindu-conspiracy or the Ghadar Conspiracy, while most reviewing the conspiracy over its entire span from Southeast Asia through Europe to the United States more often use the term indo-german conspiracy

 The machine translation will act as a bridge between people with different mother tongues
