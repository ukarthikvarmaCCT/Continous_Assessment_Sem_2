 It is no less a matter of post-independence Hindi journalism that the 'panchajanya' weekly has celebrated its Golden Jubilee, being outside the shadow of any individual proprietorship or industrial house, and in that Golden Jubilee year, its first editor as Prime Minister of India

 The only secret to Panchjanya's success may be that he was born out of socialist journalism rather than profiteering, professionalism
 dhyeywaadee patrakarita kii yatra kabhi saral or sugam nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, the journey of 'panchajanya' is a story of the struggle for independent and idealistic journalism

 He presented a rare example of dedicated journalism, a laudable fame in independent journalism

 uske sampadak, prakaashak or mudrak ko jail main band kar diya, uske karyaalay par taala thok diya

 While 'panchajanya' tried to make the readers aware of the phenomena of the country and abroad in the light of their cultural vision through many columns in the limited collection of their general issue, they also think on the original national questions by thinking articles
 Provided the content of

 On studying the old numerals of 'panchajanya', it would be clear that if the warnings of 'pachjanya' were heard in time, the separatism, five-pronged dissolution and the crisis of political parties that we are going through, would not have come before us

 Snorkeling is a practice of swimming in water under which diving masks are equipped with a tube called snorkel and usually swim fins
 apekshaakrit thande pani main waitsoot bhi pahana ja saktaa he
 The use of this device allows the snorkeler to observe the underwater movements with relatively little effort
 snorkelling, dil bailaav kaa ek lokapriy tarika he, khaastaur par ushn katibandheey resorton or scuba gotakhori ke ilaakon main
 scuba gotakhori ke liye aavashyak jatil upkarnon or prashikshan ke bina or scuba gotakhori ke upkarnon se nikalne vaale hawa ke bulabulon ke bina pani ke bheetar ke jivan ko prakritik rup se dekhne kaa mauka hi logon ke liye praathmik aakarshan he
 Scuba divers also use snorkeling when on the surface, and search and rescue teams can use snorkel in water-based searches
 yah underwater hockey, underwater aais hockey, underwater rugby or pani ke neeche machhlee ke shikaar jaise lokapriy khelo main ek saadhan bhi he
 a swimmer's snorkel is a tube that is approximately 30 cm long, with an internal diameter of 1
5 to 2
5 cm, usually made of l or J-shaped rubber or plastic with a mouthpiece at the bottom
 jab pahanane vaale kaa munh or naak pani main duube rahete hai tab iskaa istemaal pani ke upar se saans lene main kiya jaataa he
 The snorkel usually consists of a piece of rubber that attaches the snorkel to the outer strap of the diving mask
 puraani takanic ke hisaab se snorkel ko gotakhori mukhute qi pattee or sar ke bich ghused dete the par is tareeke se mukhute main risaav hone kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 The most common form of snorkel is a tube that allows water to flow when underwater
 snorcolor, snorkel se pani ko nikaalata he yaa to sataha par aane par tej uchhvas dwaara yaa sataha par pahunchane se thik pehle sar ke pichley hisse ko jhukaate hue sataha par aane yaa use "todane" se pehle pani ko dhakelte hue or agali saans khinchne se pehle aage kii taraf rukh karata he
 In the displacement method, water is thrown out by the placement of air in the snorkel instead of water; It is a relatively more developed technique that requires practice and empties the snorkel with more capacity
 kuch aadhunik snorklon main mukhnal main pani kii thodi maatra banaae rakhane ke liye samp kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he or jab snorcolor saans letaa he to pani bheetar nahin jaataa
 kuch snorklon main samp ke bheetar ek ekatarfa valve laga hota he, jo pani bharne kii sthiti main samp ko swatah hi khaali kar detaa he
 Some snorkels have movable valves that attach to the top half of the hose, these valves keep water out of the snorkel when the snorkeler goes underwater, some more modern designs would have a deflector at the top
 That is, it diverts the water coming towards the open tube to the outer tube, so that the water in the mouth of the user is not allowed
 pani ko bheetar jane se rokane ke liye, kuch snorkel ko nalee ke khule hisse main ek pinjade main choti "ping pong" gendon ko laga kar banaaya jaataa tha, lekin snorcolor ke liye khatarnaak hone ke naate ab na to ise bechaa jaataa he or na hi istemaal ke liye kharida jaataa he
 Similarly, diving masks fitted with snorkel are unsafe and outdated
 snorkel nalee kii shreshth banaavat kii lambaai adhiktam 40 centimetre hoti he
 Deep snorkeling makes it difficult to breathe through a long tube because the water pressure on the lungs increases greatly when going deep
 aise main jab snorcolor saans letaa he to fefde fail nahin pate kyonki fefdon ko failaane vaali mansapeshiyaan gahare pani ke ucch dabaav ke khilaaf kaam karne kii takat nahin rakhti
 snorkel, "ded air spes" utpann karti he, jab prayokta taji saans letaa he tab snorkel main pehle kii nikaali hui saans bachi rahati he jo fefdon main phir se chali jaati he, isse saans lene kii kshamta kam ho jaati he, isi kaaran hypercapnia hota he jisame rakt main carbon daai oxide banane lagata he
 The greater the amount of air in the snorkel, the more the problem increases
 aadhunik snorkelling takanic CO2 dhaaran ko kam karne main sahaayta karti he
 Mark r Johnson MD invented a "cadence technique" snorkel that uses a one-way valve for the direct flow of air and separating the ventilation paths
 uchhavas valve snorkel main uchhavas ke maarg main ek pratirodh daalata he jo thoda pasch dabaav paidaa karata he, isse saamaanya saans prakriya chalati he or fefdon kaa aaytan bad jaataa he
 When immersed within the surface, the exit path is closed, thus the snorkeler can breathe on the surface without purifying the snorkel
 haalanki mukhauta pahananaa or pani main scornal or tairne kii kriya ko takneekee rup se "snorkelling" kaha jaataa he, par saamanytah yah mana jaataa he qi "snorcolor" inhen pahan kar mukhya rup se shailamalaon, daraaron or anya dubi hui chizon ke aas-paas kaam karata he jiske tahat vah yaa to jaleey jeevon jaise machhlee, shaiwal aadi kaa prekshan karata he yaa phir shail ke gathan ko dekhtaa he
 Due to the non-competitive trend, snorkeling is seen more as an entertainment than a sport
 snorkelling ke liye kisi khaas prashikshan qi jarurat nahin hoti, sirf tairne or snorkel se saans lene kii kshamta honi chahie
 Nevertheless, from a security perspective, it is advisable to seek directions from an experienced "snorkeler" companion, tour guide, diving shop or rental equipment store
 nirdeshon main aamtaur par upkarnon ke istemaal, saamaanya suraksha or kya dekhnaa tathaa kya khojna he or sangrakshan nirdesh hote hai 
 In scuba diving it is always advised not to go snorkeling alone, guide or tour group, take someone along
 snorkelling kii kuch vyavasik jagahon par snorkel karne waalon ko hawa dhaaran karne vaale antajvastr, jo ki vyaktigat tairaaki upkaran ki tarah ho, ko pahanane ki jarurat hoti he
 They are usually bright yellow or orange, with a device that allows the user to inflate or deflate according to their buoyancy
 haalanki ye upkaran snorkel karne vaale ko ko kisi gaharaai main mukt gotakhori se rokte or bachaate hai
 a wet suit of sufficient thickness and size should be worn, especially in cold water, this wet suit provides some buoyancy against drowning
 ushn pradeshon main snorkel karne vaale apni jaangho tathaa peeth ki twachaa ko surydah se bachaane ke liye praayah raishguard yaa shart or / yaa chaude payaanche vaale sharts pahante hai
 Experienced snorkelers often begin to test their amateur free diving, which is possible only after the training of a diving director or experienced free diver
 snorcolor ke liye sabase bada khatra he- manoranjan ke liye istemaal hone vaale choti tatavarti naaven jaise jet ski, speed boat or aisi hi anya naaven
 snorcolor jab pani main hota he to pani ke upar sirf ek choti nalee dikhti he
 Since these boats run in areas where there are snorkelers, there is a possibility of collision accident
 apni shant pranodan vyavastha ke kaaran celboat or wind sarfar inke liye khaastaur par chintaa kaa kaaran hote hai kyonki ve unki upasthiti se sachet nahin ho pate, jabaki motor se chalane vaali naav pani ke bheetar chaar guna tej awaz karti he
 The snorkeler may come under or / and collide with such boats
 kuch jagahon par snorcolor kshetra ko choti naav vaale kshetron se alag chinhit kiya jaataa he, jabaki niyamit snaan karne waalon ke liye sthaan ko peepe dwaara chinhit kiya jaataa he
 So the snorkeler can use bright and high reflective colors / clothes to wear it and / or use diving flags for easy marking by sailors and other people
 snorcolor kii peeth lambe samay tak surya ke sampark main rahane ke kaaran buree tarah jhulas jaati he or pataa bhi nahin lagata
 samuchit pahanava jaise "rash guard", ek tii shart, ek wet suut or / yaa san blaak kriim san bern ke khatre ko kam kar degi
 Water scarcity is another danger
 yah suzav diya jaataa he kii jane se pehle acchhee tarah pani pi len, khaastaur par agar aap kai ghante ke snorkel par ja rahe hai
 a sufficient amount of water also prevents the stretch of the muscle
 snorcolor ko ati vaayu sanchaar kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he jo use "shailo water blike out" kii sthiti main le ja sakati he, kisi saathi ke saath snorkelling par jane se is sthiti ko taala ja saktaa he
 While snorkeling near the coral island, one should be aware of the coral corals and the poisonous creatures living in them, for which use of safety gloves and awareness of the environment around them can be done
 bhaate dwaara ubhari hui chattaanon ke upar, yaa bahari chattan ke gahare pani main chalane main booti or sarf juute vishesh taur par sahaayak hote hai
 Snorkeling is possible in any kind of water, but where the waves are low, the water is hot and there is something special near the surface to see, where most of the snorkelers go
 aamtaur par samudr tal se 1 se 4 meter kii chhichhli chattaane snorkel karne waalo kii pasandida jagahen hai
 Deep rocks are also better, but snorkel here rarely goes due to its ability to hold breath in these depths when diving because fitness and ability levels must be high to get there

 orovil kaa uddeshy maanviya ekta kii anubhuti karnaa he
 Auroville was founded by "mother" Meera Alfassa on Wednesday 28 February 1968 as a project of the Sri Aurobindo Society
 ve shri orobindo kii baraabar kii aadhyatmik sahyogi thi, jinka maananaa tha ki "manushya ek parivarti jeev he"

 Because it became a religious language, even after fading away from the ordinary life of this language, it continued to be used to write new texts
 san 1500 isapurv ke yug kii keval do irani bhashaaon kii likhit rachanaayen mili hai
 There is an "ancient avastai" that was spoken in the northeast and an "ancient Persian" that was spoken in the southwest
 irani bhashaaon main yah purvi irani bhashaaon or pashchimi irani bhashaaon kaa ek bahut bada vibhaajan he
 There was only one "primitive indo-iranian language" at the beginning - all languages of the indo-iranian language family are born, including Sanskrit, Hindi, Kashmiri, Persian, Pashto
 pracheen avastai us yug kii bhashaa he jab purvi irani bhashaayen or vaidic sanskrit bahut milti-julati thim
 Some changes were taking place in the Western Iranian languages, due to which she was slightly different from Vedic Sanskrit
 kaha ja saktaa he ke pracheen avastai in donon ke bich thi - yah vaidic sanskrit se bahut milti-julati he or yah pracheen farsi se bhi milti julati he
 Compositions are less in Avastai language, so linguists seek first aid by studying Vedic Sanskrit to understand Avastai word-grammar as Avastai and Vedic Sanskrit have close links in this area

 It had 13 original characters whose avastai used 53 different forms
 yah akshar aramai lipi par aadhaarit the, jis se bharat kii bhi sari aadhunik lipiyaan utpann hui hai
 In ancient times, people of Parsi community based in India also wrote Avastai in scripts based on Brahmi
 raja maansingh amer va mandiron kaa pancharanga dhvaj
 The flag of any king or religion is a symbol of their supremacy, prestige, force and presiding deity

 But the practice of hoisting the Panchranga flag in the temples of Sanatan Dharma began during the Mughal period
 jaisaa ki upar bataaya ja chukaa he dhwaja varchasv, pratishtha, bal or ishtdev kaa pratik hoti he
 To express this sentiment, Raja Mansingh of Amer designed his own state flag which was white in color and accepted it as a Kunwar

 King Mansingh destroyed them and destroyed all the weapons manufacturing factories there and brought the best weapon making machines and artisans from there and set up an arms factory in Jaigarh
 is kaarywahi ke parinaam swaroop hi yawanon ke bharat par akraman band hue va bache-khuche hindu rajyon ko bharat main apni shakti ekatra karne kaa avasar praapt hua
 King Mansingh arranged for the living of saintly saints in the Hindu states of India
 hindu raajaaon ke liye ghode kii daud pratiyogita yojit kiya jaataa tha saath main pratiyogita kaa parinaam kaa fal sadhu santon ke dwaara di jaati thi
 Raj Mansingh was very happy with this type of event

 pracheen bhartiya darshan main is prakaar ke namwala koi shaastra prasiddh nahin he
 Logic was not born as an independent scripture in Indian philosophy
 akshapaad! gautam yaa gautam kaa nyayasutra pehla granth he, jisamen tathakthith tarkshastra kii samasyaon par vyavasthit dhang se vichaar kiya gaya he
 a large part of the above sutras considers these problems, yet in the said book, this subject has been represented as part of philosophy
 nyaayadarshan main solah pareekshaneey padaarthon kaa ullekh he
 Among them, the first evidence is the subject or substance of the name
 vastutah bhartiya darshan main aaj ke tarkshastra kaa sthanapann 'pramanshastra' kaha ja saktaa he
 But the content of the certificate is more elaborate than logic
 europe main tarkshastra kaa pravartak evam pratishthata unani darshanik arestu samajha jaataa he, yon usase pehle katipay tarkshastreey samasyaon par vaitandic shikshakon, sucraat tathaa aflatoon yaa plato dwaara kuch chintan hua tha
 It is interesting that Aristotle himself, who for the first time in the history of ideas, divided knowledge into different branches, is not familiar with the name 'logic'
 usne apni etadvishyak vichaarna ko 'enelytics' naam se abhihit kiya he
 The first use of the logic word 'lajika' is found in the Roman writer Cicero, though there is a different meaning
 arestu ke anusaar tarkshastra kaa vishay chintan he, na ki chintan ke vaahak shabdpratik
 The following topics are mainly presented in his logical texts: vaakya padon se banataa he
 Each verse indicates certain objects and also signifies certain qualities or characteristics
 vastusanket kii visheshta pad kaa 'dinotesan' kehalaati he, sanketit swarupaprakashak gunon ko samshti rup main 'conotesan' kehete hai, jaise 'manushya' pad kaa dinotesan 'sab manushya' he, uskaa conotesan 'praanitiv' tathaa 'buddhisampannatv' he
 Each sentence has an objective term, a predicate term and a valence connecting them
 vidhey pad kai shreniyon ke hote hai, kuch uddeshy kaa swaroop-kathan karanevaale, kuch uski bahari visheshtaon ko batalaanevaale
 The classification of predicate terms has a close relationship with Aristotle's definitional ideas
 vaakyon yaa kathanon kaa vargeekaran bhi kai prakaar hota he; arthath gun, pariman, sambandh or nishchayaatmakataa ke anusaar
 The sentence catagorical by relation; Hetuetmud; And are disjunctive
 nishchayatmakataa ke anusaar kathanaatmak, sambhavya or nishchayatmak teen prakaar ke hote hai
 The major form of the sentence is 'catagorical'
 vaise vaakyon kaa vargeekaran gun tathaa pariman ke anusaar hota he
 Four types of sentences are available by classification, corresponding to the types of properties and quantities, which are indicated by the Roman letters - A, E, I, O
 vidheyatmak sarv sambandhi vidhayak or nishedh vaakya kii sangya e or i he,jaise 'sabhi manushya purna he' or 'koi manushya purna nahin he'; kuch sambandhi vidhayak or nishedhak vaakya kramshah ai va o kahate he; yatha - 'kuch manushya shikshit hai' or 'kuch manushya shikshit nahin he
 ' arestu ke tarkshastra kaa pradhan pratipaadya vishay nyayavakyon main vyakt kiye janevaale anumaan he; sahi anumaan 19 prakaar ke hote hai jo chaar tarah kii avyavsanhatiyon main prakashit kiye jate hai
 The four types of justice sentence components are called 'figures' and the correct approximations found in them are called 'moods'
 ye 'mood' duusari 'figuron' se pehali 'figure' ke roopon main parivartit kiye ja sakate hai
 The first figure is considered the most complete figure
 bhartiya darshan main, jaisaa upar kaha gaya, jis cheez kaa vikaas hua, vah pramanshastra he; tathakthith tarkshastra uskaa ek bhaag maatr he
 In Gautama's 'nyasutra', the specific or primary cause producing prama or real knowledge is called 'evidence'; Their number is four, namely, direct, inference, subhuman and word
 bhatt mimasakon or vedantiyon ke anusaar pramaan chah hai, arthath upyukt chaar tathaa arthpatti va anuplabdhi
 There has been a lot of thinking and controversy in the Indian epistemology about the above evidences
 baudhon, naiyayikon, vedantiyon aadi ke dwaara kiya hua pratyaksh kaa vishleshan vishesh rup main unke apane-apane tatvamimasaa sambandhi vichaaron se prabhavit he
 According to justice, there are two types of estimation, altruism and self prediction
 anumaan ke bodhak nyayavakya main paanch vaakya hote hai jo kramshah pratigya, hetu, udhaaharan, upanay tathaa nigaman kehalaate hai
 According to the Vedanti, three sentences starting from these five or later are sufficient for inference
 buddha tarkshastri dharmakirti ke mat main trirup arthath teen visheshtaon se yukt ling yaa hetu hi anumaan kaa kaaran he
 These three characteristics are - permissible or fixed presence in favor; Presence in the sapaksha itself; And a definite absence in the opposition or opposition
 yahan parvat paksh he, jahaan dhooma kii upasthiti se agni kaa anumaan kiya jaataa he; rasoighar sapaksh he, jahaan hi anishchit upasthiti ke saath dhooma kii upasthiti vidit he, jahaan agni ke saath dhooma kii anupasthiti nishchit he
 Next we will use the term 'logic' in its narrow, modern sense
 is arth ke daayre main tarkshastra kii paribhaasha kya hogi? jaan stuart mil ke mat main tarkshastra kaa vishay anumitiyaan hai, na ki anubhavgamya satya
 Logic is not a science of beliefs, it is not a science of evidence or evidence
 tarkshastra kaa kshetra hamaare gyaan kaa vah ansh he, jiskaa rup 'purvagyaat satyon se anumit' hota he
 The task of logic is not to collect evidence of any truth, it is an attempt to assess whether appropriate evidence has been presented for any permission
 sankshep main tarkshastra kaa kaam sahi anumiti ke aadhaaron kii khoj he
 Knowledge of logic generates the ability for us to see and assess that evidence is not the evidence of a truth, it is an attempt to assess whether a permission is only a memorandum of deterministic basis, that is, its subject is the relationship of deterministic permissions and fundamental evidence
 Explain or expose the rules that govern the correct estimation process
 isliye kabhi kabhi kaha jaataa he ki tarkshastra ek niamak vigyaan yaa shaastra he, jiskaa kaary anumiti yaa tark ke adarsh roopon ko sthir karnaa he
 In contrast, Physics or Physics, Economics, Sociology etc
 are real science, which explore the real or real forms or rules of the object
 vigyaanon kaa yah vargeekaran kuch had tak bhraamak he
 Logic or ethics is regulatory science, this statement can be interpreted that the above scriptures artificially dictate the rules of human behavior in the field, as if the rules of right thinking and right moral behavior are not private laws of human nature but outside it There are rules to be dealt with
 kintu baat aisi nahin he
 In fact, logic is just a tool for directing those rules, which are considered to be automatic, by nature, in the right thinking forms
 vichaarsheel manushya swatah, swabhaavatah sahi or galat chintan main, nirdosh evam sadosh tarkna- prakaaron main antar karte hai
 But by making such a distinction, they do not reveal the absence or consciousness of any regulatory ideals or laws
 sahi samajhe janevaale tarkna prakaaron kaa vishleshan karke unamem anusyut niyamon ko sachet jaankaree ke dharaatal par laana, yahi tarkshastra kaa kaam he
 In the same way, ethics also informs us about the rules or ideals, which are inadvertently, in our judgments of good and bad
 isiilie kaha jaataa he ki vishisht aachaar paddati, athwa kisi samaaj kii acharsanhita tathaa naitik shiksha, us samaaj ke naitik pakshapaaton ko prakashit karti he
 In this sense, moral thinkers of country, age or society are representative thinkers of their country, era or society
 tarkshastra ke sambandh main ukt manyata se ek mahatvapurn nishkarsh anugat hota he
 If due to any reason there is a change or development in the thinking system or logic of man, then there can be change or development in the philosophical mind as well
 tarkshastra ke itihaas main aisa bhi hota he ki kalantar main chintan ke puraane mandandon yaa niyamon main sanshodhan aavashyak ho jaataa he; nae chintanaprakaaron kii sristi ke saath saath naveen tarkshastreey niyamon kaa nirupan bhi apekshit ho saktaa he
 In Europe, when the progress of physics began, there was also criticism and appreciation of Aristotle's incorporation system and the advent of different systems respectively
 europea vaicharik itihaas main is koti kaa kaary lard bekan ne kiya
 Later, as the scientific exploration system was over-analyzed, European logicians developed concepts such as incorporative methodology and hypothesis incorporation systems
 aagamanaatmak tarkshastra main un niyamon kaa vichaar kiya jaataa he, jo nirikshit ghatnaon yaa vyapaaron ke aadhaar par tatsambandhi saamaanya kathano kii uplabdhi yaa nirupan sambhav banaate hai
 Common statements often take the form of passages
 bhartiya pramanshastra main is prashn ko lekar ki vyaptivakya kii uplabdhi kaise hoti he, kaaphi chaanbin kii gai he
 'wherever there is a fire, there is fire' - it is a phrase
 spasht hi hamaare nirikshan main dhooma or agni ke saahchary ke kuch hi udhaaharan aate hai
 The question is, how can we justify imagining their universal and universal association by combining two things monitored in certain situations? This problem is called inductive problem in logic
 pariklpana nigamanpranali is uljhan main pade bina saamaanya kathanon athwa vyaptivakyon kii pramanik prakalpana ke prashn kaa samaadhaan prastut kar detii he
 In short, the system of modern scientific exploration is: upar hamane is baat par bal diya ki nai tarkpranaliyon ke vikaas ke saath saath tarkshastreey siddhanton ke swaroop main bhi newnaadhik parivartan hota he
 In this view, logic is a dynamic discipline; They are not mere compilation or mention of fixed, eternal rules
 vastutah vibhinn bhautik, jaev evam samajashastreey vigyon ke vikaas ne tarkshastra ko bahut prabhavit kiya he
 Today, more than the systems and rules of inference and reasoning, the indiscriminate process of various disciplines has become a special subject of practice
 ukt prakriya kii shastreey jaanch ko reetimimasaa kehete hai
 An explanation of greater importance is required here
 anubhav evam chintan ke vibhinn kshetron main hamaari tarknaprakriya ek hi koti kii nahin hoti
 Methods of reasoning in science and mathematics are of a type
 sahityasamiksha athwa naitik nirnyon ke kshetra main bhi ye tareeke kaaphi bhinn ho jate hai
 In other words, we can say that in the fields of art review, literature epistemology, ethics, etc
, the systems of self-determination and refutation of examiners are not the same
 ve kaaphi bhinn bhi ho sakati hai or hoti hai
 This condition is also expressed in the following words: beesvin sadi main paramparaagat arestu ke tarkshastra se bhinn pratik mulak yaa pratikanishtha tarkshastra kaa vikaas hua he
 This is a major incident in the eyes of some testers
 is naye tarkshastra ko ganitnishtha tarkshastra bhi kehete hai
 In the middle of the nineteenth century, two British clergy laid the basis of this new form of logic; These were two mathematicians - Augustus de Margan and George Boole
 inkaa mukhya anveshan yah tha ki arestu ke tarkshastra main jin anumitiyon kaa ullekh he, unamem kahin adhik kotiyon kii pramanik anumitiyaan hai
 The basis of the permissions to be revealed in Aristotle's judgments is the law of class confession
 vaise anumaan kaa prasiddh udhaaharan haih sab manushya maranshil he; yahan sucraat manushya he; isliye sucraat maranshil he yahan maranshiltaa manushya naam ke varg kaa vyapak dharm he; vah us varg main samaveshit sucraat kaa bhi dharm he
 Morgan and Boole find that the real basis of permission is special-order relationships, the rule of class inclusion is intrinsic to one of these many relationships
 atah us niyam ko anumiti kaa swatantra siddhant nahin maananaa chahie
 Secondly, there are many permissions that cannot be disclosed as justices
 udhaaharan- 'k kii avasthaa kha se adhik he or kha kii avasthaa ga se adhik he, isaliye k kii avasthaa ga se adhik he
 The famous philosopher EF00 Bradley has also indicated permissions that cannot be invested in Aristotle's jurisprudence
 upar kaha gaya he ki naveen vichaarkon ke anusaar anumiti kaa aadhaar vaakyon ke bich rahanevaale kuch sambandh hai
 The concept of 'relation' itself is difficult to define
 sambandhon kaa vargeekaran kai tarah se hota he
 Some relationships are between two terms or substances, some three, etc
 koi padaarth sambandhgrast he, yadi uske bare main kuch kathan karte hue kisi duusare padaarth kaa ullekh aavashyak ho
 'ram is the husband of Sita', 'the king poisoned his enemy', 'devadatta bought a house with ten thousand rupees from Vishnudatta;' - These sentences reveal bipartite, trilateral and quadrilateral relations respectively
 ek anya vargeekaran ke anusaar sambandh sam, visham, evam a-sam-visham teen prakaar ke hote hai
 Those who relate; As such - Ram is the brother of Shyam; Devadatta is the same or classmate of Vishnudatta; And so on
 visham sambandh ram sita kaa pati he
 a-sama Odd - Devadatta loves Vishnudatta
 ek prakaar ke sambandh utplavi sambandh kehalaate he; usase bhinn anutplavi
 'growing up in a state' is all a bizarre relationship
 yadi k kha se bada, yaa lanbaa yaa baari he;or kha ga se to yah siddh hota he k ga se bada yaa baari he
 Anuplavi is the father of kb and bk; Here it is not proved that c is the father of C
 jahaan ham dekhte hai ki utpavi sambandh anumiti kaa hetu ban jaataa he
 The theory of class inclusion propounded by Aristotle is in fact the second example of the abusive relationship, the objection relationship
 yadi vaakya ya vaakya r ko akshipt karata he or r vaakya l ko, to ya, l ko akshipt karata he
 Another feature of symbolic logic is that there sentences and their relationships are expressed by symbols
 anumiti ke aadhaar vaakyon ke vishisht sambandh he; ye sambandh vaakyon ke aakaar par nirbhar karte hai, na ki unke arthon par
 Consequently, without considering the meaning of the sentences, the corresponding relations in their shapes and the permissions based on them can be revealed in the language of symbols
 pratikit hone par vibhinn sambandhon ko sankshep main prakat kiya ja saktaa he
 This process is a notable feature of mathematics
 ganit shaastra kii unnati kaa ek pradhan hetu sankhyaon ko dashamalav vidhi se likhane kaa avishkaar tha, yah avishkaar bharatvarsh main hua
 The Roman system of writing numerals has different symbols for numbers like ten, fifty hundred, etc
; In contrast, in the prevailing decimal system, the value of a numeral is according to its position and with the help of nine digits and zero-sign, any number can be revealed
 pratikanishtha tarkshastra main virgon, vaakyon aadi ko pratikon main prakat karke unase sambhddha anumitiyon ke niyam pratipaadit kiye gaye hai
 In the quadratic, rules of mutual relations, oppositions, etc
 are given
 isi prakaar vaakyasambandhon, virodh aadi ke niyam batalaaye gaye hai
 Similarly, in syntax, regulatory principles or rules of syntax are mentioned
 arestu ke nyayavakya main sannihit siddhant ukt niyamon main se hi ek he
 It shows that the domain of symbolic logic is much broader than Aristotle's logic

 artificial intelligence do shabdon se milakar bana hota he
 1- Artificial, which is an effluent, is something that is not natural, whether it is made by humans or it is artificial
 2
 intelligence - is taatpary he ki sochane, samajhane evam seekhney kii yogyata he
