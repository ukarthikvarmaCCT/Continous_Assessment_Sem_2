 This important bridge made of masonry of lime headlines has a fascinating history behind it
 is pul main 242 foot 9 inch lambii purvapratibalit kancreet kii daaton main uthaan paat ke 20wein bhaag se bhi kam he
 It is said that once the builder, the engineer, 'katle', failed, when he got it again, he again sat under the bridge before releasing water into the canal, so that if divinely failed again If it is, then it will also be settled there itself
 jansamooh saans thame dekhtaa rahaa or pareekshan kii safalataa par atyant harsith hua
 Masonry grinds are suitable only where they are able to provide a firm, dependable base and reinforce the foundation
 aadhunik pareekshanon se siddh ho chukaa he ki paryaapt uthaan or motiwali daat yadi sudrudh aadhaar par ho or thik se dekhbhaal hoti rahe, to kaaphi bhaar le sakati he
 Due to the arrangement of masonry in the masonry, necessary adjustment occurs according to the change of temperature and internal stress or contraction stress is not produced
 antayadharon main bhi maamuli chaal hone se baari haani nahin hoti
 The base of masonry bridges is the principle of stopper, in which the load appears as a thrust in conflicting directions
 is thel kii rekha ko "raikhik daat' kehete hai, jo sthayitv kii drushti se daat ke challe ke madhyavarti tritiyansh main honi chahie
 The last stone in the stopper is called the key
 chaabi lagane ke pashchaat dhula, jisapar daat lagaate samay uskaa sara bhaar tikaa rahata he, kuch nicha kar diya jaataa he, jisase daat baith jaae or usamen dabaav ke pratibal samaan rup se santulit ho jaaen
 The search should be pre-fitted with wooden pallets or sand belts, so that the bulge or vibration does not reach the stopper while degrading, and the whole search can be done once
 40 foot se adhik paat kii daat lagaate samay dhule ke madhya bhaag par vahaan laganevaali sab iten lad deni chahie, phir daat lagaana aarambh karnaa chahie
 In principle, if the shape of the stopper is suitable, so that the linear stopper remains in the midpoint, then the pressure will remain in the stopper and the stopper will remain even if there is no spice in the masonry joints
 uthaan or paat kaa anupaat, jahaan tak sambhav ho, adhik rakhana chahie
 When this ratio is less than 1 / 5, the heat and contraction effects increase and due to the load, the damping and thawing also increase
 at: 1 / 10 nunatam seemaa manani chahie
 The best ratio is from 1 / 5 to 1 / 3 with a focus on austerity
 yadi anupaat 1 / 2 or 1 / 4 ke madhya ho daat-challe or pilpayon main saamagree nunatam lagati he, kyonki gol daaton se pilpayon par bilkul thel nahin pahunchati or andakaar daat se bahut kam pahunchati he
 The parabolic or badi stopper, oval or three central stopper, is good and looks good
 dar kaa paat uski kul oonchaai se adhik ho to acha he, nahin to pilpayon, payon or baaju deevaaron main saamagree adhik lagegi
 At the end, there is a stopper from one side and clay from the other side
 at: ye itane majboot hone chahie ki kisi ek ore kii thel ke abhaav main bhi duusari ore kii thel sahan kar saken
 The pies should be strong enough to bear all the thrust generated as a result of full load on only one of the hoists on both sides

 a number of experimental formulas are used for estimation, but in important cases it is good to test the hypothesis by calculation and confirmation

 The various parts of the datum bridge and their interrelations are shown in the figure
 buniyaad ke liye jahaan pakkaa aadhaar nahin miltaa, vahaan kuen galaae jate hai
 Sometimes they have to be moved 100–200 feet deep so that the entire load is sustained on the strength of their outer surface friction

 The world's three largest Datadar bridges were built in 1902-03
 sabase bada plaen main sira nadi par bana, jiskaa paat antyadhaaron sahit 296 foot ore uthaan 59 foot he
 In order to reduce the weight, several data are placed in the length and width directions above the main stopper

 Concrete brought about a revolution

 On the pathankot-kullu road, built in 1860, there is a bridge on the 45th mile, with three pieces of 40 feet rate
 sheeghra hi prabalit kancreet ne sabakaa sthaan le liya
 Reinforced concrete slabs and grips were made in abundance, but the use of dots for larger pallets could not stop
 haan, daaten prabalit kancreet kii banane lageen
 Many reinforced concrete bridges were also built in India
 kalikat cananor sadak ke 7wein mile par korampuja pul san 1938-40 main 3

 There is also a bridge with five rates of reinforced Pratincha girder on the river Koonam in Madras
 aajkal purvapratibalit kancreet kaa prayog sabhi mahatvapurn kaaryon main hone laga he
 Preformed concrete pickets are placed on large pits, but sometimes the dots are also preferred, although their lift is relatively low

 a 1,640-foot bridge was built in it, which would claim to be the largest in the world, but just five years after its introduction, a 1,652-foot 1-inch bridge 'bayon' bridge was built at Kilwanakul in New York, four months from it
 The former was completed in 1931 and the largest stopper was created in the world

 It is one of the world's major straits vakrokti do shabdon 'vakr' or 'ukti' kii sandhi se nirmit shabd he
 It literally means - a statement which is different from the normal
 tedha kathan arthath jisamen lakshana shabd shakti ho
 Bhamah considered the curvature an ornament
 unke parvarti kuntak ne vakrokti ko ek sampurna siddhant ke rup main viksit kar kavy ke samast angon ko isamen samavisht kar liya
 Therefore Kuntaka is considered the promoter of the Vakrokti sect
 vakrokti siddhant kii pratishtha tathaa pratipaadan kaa shrey kuntak ko he parantu isaki parampara pracheen he
 References to Bhamah's predecessor poets Baan, Subandhu etc
 are found
 bhamah ne vakrokti kaa prayog vyapak arth main kiya he
 He considered the inflection of both the word and the meaning in quibble
 unhone vakrokti tathaa atishyokti kaa samaan arth main prayog kiya he
 Exaggeration means popular transcendence
 vakrokti ko isi kaaran bhamah mul alankaar maanate hai
 Without it, the sentence is no longer a poem, but dialogue remains
 dandi ne bhi vakrokti ko bhamah ke samaan mahatv diya he
 Dandi has given two distinctions of Venmayya - Swabhokti and Vakrokti
 dandi ne vakrokti tathaa atishyokti ko samast alankaaron ke mul main sweekaar kiya he
 The only difference between Bhamah and Dandi is that Bhamah accepts the expression at the periphery of curvature and Dandi considers it to be less important than the curve statement considering it to be different
 anandavardhan ne vakrokti kii swatantra vyakhya nahin kii he
 They have accepted its general and comprehensive form by considering it as a special ornament
 anandavardhan ne bhamah ke vakrokti sambandhi mahatv ko sweekaar karte hue atishyokti tathaa vakrokti ko paryaay mana or sabhi alankaaron ko atishyokti garbhit sweekaar kiya he
 Abhinavagupta has accepted the general form of curvature
 inke anusaar shabd or arth kii vakrata kaa aashay unki lokottar sthiti he tathaa is lokottar kaa arth atishay hi he
 Kuntaka, the originator of Vakrokti theory, called Vakrokti the soul of poetry in his treatise Vakrokti Jeevam
 unhone vakrokti ke antargat sabhi kavy siddhanton kaa samaahaar karte hue samast kavyangon- varna chamatkaar, shabd saundarya, vishaywastu kii romaniyata, aprastut-vidhaan, prabandh kalpana aadi ko uchit sthaan diya he
 According to Kuntaka, quibble is not just speech or utterance miracle, it is poet business or poet skill
 dow nagendra ke anusaar "aadhunik shabdaawalee main ise kalawaad kah sakate hai- kavy kaa sarvapramukh tatv kala he
 This does not mean that Kuntaka has ruled out the subject matter in his theory
 unhone kavy vastu kii swaabhaavik romaniyata ko sweekaar kiya he
 The poet should express the heart-rending religions of the poetic object
 yah kavi pratibha se hi sambhav he
 Thus, according to him, the poet business is ultimately dominant
 " In Indian poetry theory, Rasa theory is based on cognition or emotion and Alankar theory is based on the poet's imagination
 vakrokti siddhant kaa sambandh is drushti se alankaar siddhant se he
 The imagery of figures of speech in quibble has been widely accepted
 yah kalpana kavinishth he, sahrudayanishth nahin
 The difference between sound and quibble is also that the imagery of sound is benign and the imagery of curvature is poetic
 atah dhwani kaa drushtikon vyaktiparak he or vakrokti kaa vastunishth
 Kuntaka has accepted the importance of emotion along with imagination by considering Rasa as the soul of curvature
 kuntak ne ras ko vakrata kaa vishisht ang maan kar bhi angi vakrata ko hi mana he
 The condition of Ras without curvature is not possible whereas curvature without juice has its own independent position
 kuntak ne aisi sthiti ko mahatv nahin dete hue rasvihin vakrata ko tiraskaar yogya mana he
 The quibble theory of Kuntaka is a broad and co-ordinate theory
 isaki udbhaavna ke mul main alankaar siddhant kii parampara ke saath dhwani siddhant he
 The whole poetry has been accepted in Kuntaka's curvature theory
 unke siddhant main bal bhale hi kala paksh par ho par unki vyakhya ke antargat vastu paksh tathaa bhav paksh kaa puraa samaahaar he
 Sahitya Shastra - Dynasty Sahai Hira ulug beg vedhashala samarkand main sthit he
 It was built by Ulugh Beg in the 1420s
 is vedhashala ko 1449 main dhvansh kar diya gaya tha or log ise bhul gayi the kintu 1908 main ise phir khoj nikaala gaya

 darida ne likhnaa tab shuru kiya jab francisi bauddhik paridrishyon main pratibhaas or sanrachnawad drushtikon me badhata daraar saafe nazar aane laga tha
 Phenomenological perspectives call him when an experience is understood by his birthright
 sanrachnavadik drushtikon kahata he kii kisi bhi vaastu kii janmotpatti ke adhyayan se sirf tathy kaa pataa lag saktaa hen, magar uske sanrachana ke adhyayan se uske anubhav ke gahraiyon kaa abhas hota hen
 In 1959, Derrida raised questions on this ideology, asking whether each structure does not have a place of origin and whether the presence of a place of origin does not inform the existence of a structure? By this statement Derrida wants to say that both the phenomenological and structural perspectives are necessary to fully understand any architecture or principle 
 vah kehete hen kii ek sanrachana ko tab tak nahin samajha ja saktaa jab tak ham uski utpatti ke bare me na jaan len or yah naa samaj len kii vah utpatti sthal apane aap me hi ek bahut jatil or sanrachanaatmak hen
 Derrida says that this dichronism brings us closer to textuality
 deconstruction ke siddhanton ko aaj post-strekachralism kaa ek upkhand man jaataa he
 Derrida derived this theory from Saussour's structuralist theory
 sausayor ke mutabiq shabdon kaa unke anuroopit vastuon se koi prakritik sambandh nahin hen
 He says that a word acts only as a sign that points to a Vastu
 ek chinh do bhaagon kaa bana hota hen – signyphoid or signiphair 
 According to Sausaur, the relationship between a signified and a signifier is not natural but arbitrary
 har shabd ko pehle se ek matlab diya gaya he or is matlab kaa us vaastu ke vaastavik rup se koi sambandh nahin hota
 However, because every word has a meaning attached to it, the relationship between them seems to be stable
 darida is sthir rishte ko chunauti dete hue kehete hen kii chunki ek shabd kaa arth kabhi us shabd ke andar kaid nahin kiya ja saktaa or uskaa matlab tabhi samajha ja saktaa hen jab use baaki shabdon ke antar me dekha jaae, isiilie ek shabd kaa arth sambhandit rup me hi samajha ja saktaa hen
 He says that we can identify red color correctly because it is different from blue or green
 ham is antar ko pahachaanatein he or isiilie unhen alag alag rangon ke rup me jaanate hai
 According to Derrida, every Vastu has a double opposite, such as light and dark, white and black, good and bad, etc
 ise or vistaar me samajhaate hue vah kehete hen kii ek shabd kaa puraa arth kabhi us shabd me samaaya nahin hota he
 And since the full meaning is not absorbed, we can say that the meaning is absent
 tatah ek dwichar vipareet ko deconstruct karne ke liye aavashyak he kii haashie avadhi ke mahatv ko pahachaanaa jaye, kyonki isi shabd ke aadhaar par visheshadhikrut avadhi ko arth miltaa he
 a double meaning is a sign of something that is absent
 ham ek kursi ko kursi maanate hen kyonki vah ek mez se alag he
 This absence is referred to as Derrida Difference
 unke mutabik difpherans banataa he diference or deferral ke sanghatan se
 The meaning of a sign is always beyond it
 atah ek chinh puri tarah apane me samaaya nahin hota, vah hameshaa ek dusre chinh yaa vaastu pe nirbhar rahata hen, apane se pare kii taraf ishaara karata he
 For this reason, Derrida says that the full meaning of a symbol can be understood only on the basis of its opposite and the avoidance of its meaning and the meaning remains like a light target
 faltah darida kehete hen kii ek transsendental signyphoid dhundne kii aavashyaktaa hen, arthath ek aisa chinh yaa signiphair jisko apane arth ke liye dusre signiphair par nirbhar na hona pade
 However, it is clear that this is not possible
 darida deconstruction kii paribhaasha kuch is tarah dete hen – deconstruction ek gambhir ruukh yaa padhane or vishleshan kii ranneeti he jise sahitya, bhashaa vaigyaanan, darshanashasre, kanoon or sthapaty me lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 It is a theory of language, a way of reading that always tries to fragment, destroy, and overturn any notion of a work's boundary, margin, coherence, fixed meaning, truth and identity
 deconstruction prashn karata he un har tarah kii kritiyon se or dikhaata he kii vah sab aise tareeke or pranaaliyon pe aadhaarit he jo kii kritim rup se banaaye gaye he or uname koi param satya nahin he
 Deconstruction rejects the system of addition that tries to encapsulate every meaning in the same work
 deconstruction kaa zikr darida pehali baar apane kriti of grammtologi me karte hai, jo kii unhone san 1967 me likhi thi
 The meaning of grammatology, according to Derrida, is the science of written language
 is kriti me darida kehate hen kii jab bhashaa ko lekhan ke rup me samajha jaataa he tab uske arth kaa jo haal hota he, ise ham deconstruction kehate hen
 It means to say that even if written is ours, but we have not given meaning to those words, he was already present in the world
 saalon se un shabdon kaa arth vahi rahaa he, isiilie bhashaa hamaare bas me kabhi nahin hoti
 Deconstruction exists because interpretation, agreement negotiation and translation are essentially available in a few
 aage darida yah bhi kehate hen kii sanrachana par yojan karne vaale ek madhyabindu kaa purvanumaan lagate hen, lekin yah madhyabindu virodhabhas se sanrachana ke donon andar or baahar rahata he
 Derrida says that this midpoint is a hypothetical idea
 madhyabindu sanrachana ko niyantrit karata he kintu apane hi nirmit kaanoon kaa paalan nahin karata
 For example - God creates this vision, but he does not live in this world, he is beyond this world
 vah yah bhi kehate hen kii ek sanrachana ke madhyambindu se mukt hona na mumkin he kyonki use ham hameshaa dusre madhyabindu ke liye badla ja saktaa he, jese kii bhagwan jo kii dharamshastra ke madhyasthal me he unhen ham pita yaa aatma se badal sakate hen
 Therefore, we find that the known static entities are not always the way we see them
 deconstruction upasthithi ko apana mudda bana leti he
 The presence is a desire for the midpoint of a fixed, fixed and unitary meaning
 It can be called Logoscentrism (logos meaning Greek, cause, thought or word)
 jab yah sab madhyabindu man jaae to use logocentrism kehete hen
 According to the deconstruction, no person maintains anything outside the work
 This does not mean that the readers should focus only on the words, but it means that there is nothing outside the experience of a work
 It means to say that a work is not separate from its context
 itihaas, raajnneeti, jeevani ityadi sabhi sandarbh kaa hissaa hen
 ek kriti ko puri tarah samajhane ke liye uske sandarbh ko samajhnaa anivaary he
 Stem cells or stem cells are cells in which any organ of the body has the ability to grow as a cell
 iske saath hi ye anya kisi bhi prakaar kii koshikaon main badal sakati he
 According to scientists, these cells can be used to repair any cell in the body
 is prakaar yadi hriday kii koshikaayen kharaab ho gayi, to inaki marammat stem koshika dwaara kii ja sakati he
 Similarly, if the cells of the eye cornea become defective, they can also be developed and transplanted by stem cells
 isi prakaar maanav ke liye atyaavashyak tatv vitamin si ko bimariyon ke ilaaj ke udadeshy se stem koshika paidaa karne ke liye bhi prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Stem cells in their original simple form are underdeveloped cells that have the potential to gain specificity as developed cells
 clonan ke saath jaev praudyogiki ne ek or kshetra ko janm diya he, jiskaa naam he koshika chikitsa
 Under this, such cells are studied which have the ability to grow, divide and differentiate to form new tissues

 These cells, derived from the bone marrow, produce blood in the body for a lifetime, and the entire blood system can be reabsorbed by transplanting them in diseases like cancer
 aisi koshikaon ko hi stem koshika kehete hai
 These cells are used to grow healthy cells

 However, cells preserved at the time of birth of a younger brother or sister may also prove to be helpful
 bhrun vikaas ke dauraan dimb vah ek koshika he, jo puure jeev ko banane kii purna kshamta rakhti he
 These cells divide several times to form cells that are fully competent, that means each cell can become a complete organism when it is divided

 Therefore, they are called partially competent cells
 bhitari koshikaayen kai baar vibhajit or vibhedit hokar vishesh koshikaayen banaatin hai, jo prayek utak ko punerjeevit karne kii kshamta rakhti hai
 These are called multi-competent cells
 ye koshikaayen prayek utak main sangrakshit rahati hai, tathaa utakon main koshika janan tathaa punah sanrachana ke liye upyogi hoti hai
 Partially competent cells may also be used in place of them

 Laboratory stem cells can treat many types of blood cancer in the near future
 is prakriya dwaara daant kaa upachaar bhi sambhav he
 According to Yukio Nakamura, a Japanese stem cell scientist, it is possible to treat aplastic anemia, ie red blood cell deficiency and thalassemia with stem cell technology
 is takanic main bhruneey stem koshikaon kaa upyog nahin hota, atev yah naitik vivaadon se pare he
 Along with the elimination of blood cancer cells through anti-cancer elements, normal hematopoietic cells are also eliminated

 Therefore, his team has developed such a technique, which can produce red blood cells from other cells in the laboratory
 ise pashuon main surakshit or prabhavi tareeke se sabit kiya ja chukaa he
 The team of researchers at the Scripps Research Institute, California, has discovered a simple technique using a tool called SNP genotype
 is takanic se maanav kii bhruneey stem koshikaon kii line kaa nirdhaaran sambhav hoga
 a new technique has been invented to find out the ethnic origin of stem cell lines, which will make it possible to develop effective drugs and medical methods to treat various diseases
 stem koshika line lagaataar vibhajit hone vaali koshikaon kaa ek samooh he jo stem koshikaon ke ekal paitruk samooh se nirmit hota he
 The stem cell groups still being used in laboratories are mostly from Caucasian and East Asian populations while the percentage of people of African descent is very low

 yah aam taur par powder ke rup main maujuud kriyasheel padaarthon evam anudravyon ke mishran se milakar bana hota he, jinhen ek powder se sampeedit yaa dabaakar ek thos khuraaq main badla jaataa he
 Responses for making tablets efficiently may include tanners, bonding or granulating agents, substances and lubricants that increase the flow capacity of the powder; Disintegrator to promote fragmentation of the tablet in the digestive tract; Sweeteners or fragrances to enhance taste; And colors can be included to make the tablet look attractive
 tablet ko adhik chikna or nigalane main adhik aasaan banane, sakriy avyav ke sravit hone kii dar ko niyantrit karne, ise paryaavaran ke prati adhik pratirodhi banane yaa tablet ko aakarshak banane ke liye aksar ek bahulak kaa lep lagaaya jaataa he
 The compressed tablet is the most popular dosage used today
 lagbhag do-tihaai nuskhon ko thos khuraaq ke rup main nirdisht kiya jaataa he or inamen se aadhe sankuchit tablet ke rup main hote hai
 a tablet can be prepared to give the right amount in a specific situation; It is usually taken orally but can also be taken under the tongue, within the cheek, rectal passages or vaginal tract
 tablet, maukhik aushadhi ke kai roopon main se ek he, jaise ki seerup, eligsir, suspension evam emlshan
 aushadhiy tablet ko multah unke ghatakon dwaara nirdhaarit kiye gaye kisi bhi rang ke discs ke aakaar main banaaya gaya tha, lekin vibhinn aushadhiyon se antar bataane ke liye unhen ab kai aakaaron or rangon main banaaya gaya he
 Symbols, letters and numbers are often printed on the tablet by which they are identified
 nigalane vaali tablet ke aakaar kuch millimetre se lekar ek centimetre tak ho sakate hai
 Some tablets are capsule-shaped and are called "caplets"
 aushadhiy tablet or capsulon ko aksar goliyaan kaha jaataa he
 This is technically incorrect, because tablets are made by compression, while tablets are a form of ancient solid food that is made by wrapping a solid body in a round shape
 kuch anya utpaadon kaa bhi tablet ke rup main nirmaan kiya jaataa he taaki ghulne yaa khandit hone main aasaani ho; jaise safai or durgandh naashak utpaada
 In the tablet compression process, it is important that all materials are completely dry, powdered or granular, the particles are approximately the same size, and they flow easily
 Mixed particle-sized powders can vary during formulation due to different densities, which may result in the manufacture of tablets lacking a uniformity of ingredients of a subcutaneous drug or active pharmaceutical ingredient, but is hindered by the condensation process
 Can be applied
 avyav kii ekarupata yah sunishchit karti he ki prayek tablet ke saath epiai kii samaan khuraaq di jaae
 Some apis can be added to tablets as pure substances, but this rarely happens; Most formulations include longitudinal

 Different types of host can be used, some of which common names include lactose, dibasic calcium phosphate, sucrose, corn starch, microcrystalline cellulose, and modified cellulose
 aksar, tablet ko ek baar nigal kar, avasorana ke liye epiai sravit karne par, uske visarjan main sahaayta pradaan karne ke liye ek ghatak ko vighatak ke rup main bhi kaary karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Some mortgages such as starch and cellulose are also excellent mortgages
 aam taur par snehak kii thodi si maatra bhi milaayi jaati he
 The most common of these is magnesium stearate; However, other commonly used tablet lubricants include stearic acid, hydrogenated oil, and sodium stearyl fumarate
 Once compressed, it helps the tablet to get out of the dye easily
 tablet istemaal karne main saral or suvidhajanak hote hai
 They provide a precisely measured dose of the active ingredient in a convenient portable package and can be formulated to protect volatile drugs or change the appearance of distasteful ingredients
 rangeen aavarnon, udkeern chihnon or mudran kaa istemaal tablet kii pahchaan karne main sahaayta pradaan karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Manufacturing processes and techniques can provide special properties to the tablet, for example, continuous release or fast dissolving formulations
 kuch aushadhiyaan maukhik maarg se prayog ke liye anupyukt ho sakati hai
 For example, protein drugs such as insulin may be distorted by stomach acids
 aisi aushadhiyon kii tablet taiyaar nahin kii ja sakati he
 Some drugs can be inactivated by the liver when they are transported from the gastrointestinal tract there by the liver portal vein, making them unsuitable for oral use
 jin aushadhiyon ko jihva ke neeche liya ja saktaa he unhen mukh kii shleshmik jhilli ke dwaara avshishit kiya jaataa he jisase ki ve yakrut se bachakar baahar nikal saken evam ve pratham sankat path prabhaav ke prati kam grahanksham hoti hai
 The oral bioavailability of some drugs may be low due to low absorption from the gastrointestinal tract
 aisi aushadhiyon ko bahut adhik khuraaqon main yaa injection dwaara die jane kii jarurat hoti he
 The oral route is not suitable for quick-acting or severe side-effects
 udhaaharan ke liye, salbutamol, jiskaa istemaal phuffusiya pranali kii samasyaon ke upachaar ke liye kiya jaataa he, ko maukhik rup se istemaal karne par hriday or parisancharan tantra par prabhaav pad saktaa he; choti khuraaq ko saans ke saath khinchakar kriya kiye jane ke liye aavashyak sthaan par andar pahunchaakar in prabhaavon ko atyadhik kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Tablets can be made in virtually any shape, although the requirements of patients and tablet-making machines mean that most are round, oval, or capsule-shaped
 More unnatural shapes have been created, but patients consider them more difficult to swallow and have a greater risk of being ruptured from their edges or affected by construction problems

 chhidron or motaai ke bich duuri jitani kam hoti he, sampeedan ke dauraan lagaaya gaya bal utana adhik hota he or kabhi-kabhi tablet adhik kathor hoti he
 The tablet should be so strong that they do not break inside the bottle, and they should be so brittle that it breaks easily into the gastric tube
 tablet ko itnaa adhik majboot hona chahie ki ve packaging, ladaan evam pharmacist tathaa rogi dwaara uthaane-rakhane ke tanaavon ko jhel saken
 tablet kii yantric shakti kaa moolyankan saadhaaran vifaltaa or kataav pareekshan or adhik parishkrut ejineering pareekshanon ke ek sangyojan kaa upyog kar ke kiya jaataa he
 Often more general tests are used for the purposes of quality control, while more complex tests are used in the research and development phase during formulation and designing of the manufacturing process
 tablet ke gunon ke maanakon ko vibhinn antarrashtriya aushadhkosh main prakashit kiya jaataa he
 Lubricants prevent the ingredients from turning together into clumps and sticking into tablet pores or capsule filling machines
 snehak yah bhi sunishchit karte hai ki tablet kaa nirmaan evam utkshepan thos evam daai kii diwaar ke bich nimna gharshan ke saath ho
 Common minerals and fats, such as chalk or silica, magnesium stearate or stearic acid, are the most commonly used lubricants in tablets or hard gelatin capsules
 tablet ko sampeedit karne kii prakriya main, mukhya dishanirdesh yah sunishchit karnaa he ki sakriy avyav kii uchit maatra prayek tablet main rahe
 isliye, sabhi avyavon ko acchhee tarah se mishrit kiya janaa chahie
 yadi paryaapt rup se samroop ghatakon kaa mishran saral sammishran prakriyaaon ke saath praapt nahin kiya ja saktaa he, to antim tablet main sakriy yogic kaa samaan vitaran sunishchit karne ke liye sampeedan se pehle avyavon ko daanedaar rup main badla janaa chahie
 tablet ke rup main sampeedan ke liye powder ko daanedaar rup main badalane ke liye do moolbhoot takneekon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he: adra kaneekaran or shushk kaneekaran 
 jin pouderon ko acchhee tarah se mishrit kiya ja saktaa he unhen daanedaar rup main badalane kii jarurat nahin hoti he or unhen prayaksh sampeedan dwaara tablet main sampeedit kiya ja saktaa he
 Humid condensation is a process of using a liquid bond to convert a powder mixture to a light mass
 taral padaarth kii maatra ko uchit prakaar se niyantrit kiya janaa chahie, kyonki atyadhik geela hona kanon ko bahut adhik kathor bana degaa or kam geela hona unhen atyadhik mulaayam or bhurabhura bana degaa
 jalkrut vilyanon kaa laabh yah hota he ki ve vilaayak aadhaarit pranaaliyon kii tulana main prayog karne main adhik surakshit hote hai lekin ve un aushadhiyon ke liye upyukt nahin ho sakate hai jo jaleey vishleshan dwaara apkshinit ho jate hai
 Low denaturing humidification processes use very common mixing devices and can take a long time to achieve a uniformly mixed state
 aparupan vaali adra kaneekaran prakriyaayein us upkaran kaa upyog karti hai jo powder evam taral padaarth ko bahut teevr gati se mishrit karata he or is prakaar nirmaan prakriya kii gati ko tej kar detaa he
 Fluid layer centrifugation is a multi-step humidification process that is carried out in a single vessel to preheat the vessel, turn the material into a granular form, and dry the powders
 kaneekaran prakriya ke kareebi niyantran kii anumati pradaan karne ke kaaran iskaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Dry denaturing processes produce grains by light condensation of the powder mixture under low pressure
 is tarah se nirmit thos dhire-dhire tut jate hai or daanon kaa nirmaan karte hai
 This process is often used when the products that turn into grains are sensitive to moisture and heat
 shushk kaneekaran ko tablet press yaa roller compactor naamak role press main kiya ja saktaa he
 The dry centrifugation equipment provides a variety of pressures to achieve proper density enhancement and to manufacture grains
 shushk kaneekaran adra kaneekaran kii tulana main adhik saamaanya hota he isliye laagat kam ho jaati he
 However, dry condensation often produces a high percentage of granular grains that can compromise quality or cause yield problems for tablets
 shushk kaneekaran ke liye sasanjak gunon vaali aushadhiyon yaa anudravyon kii jarurat hoti hai or daanon ke nirmaan ko sahaj karne ke liye sutrikaran main ek ’shushk bandhak’ milaane kii jarurat ho sakati he
 After granulation, a final lubrication step is used during the tablet making process to prevent the mixture of the tablet from sticking to the device
 isamen aamtaur par powder kiye hue snehak ke saath daanon kaa nimna aparupan mishran jaise ki magnesium stearet yaa stiarik amla shaamil hota he
 Whichever process is used to prepare the tablet manufacturing mixture, the process of making a tablet by powder condensation is very similar to that
 sabase pehle, powder ko daai main upar se bharaa jaataa he
 The mass of the powder is determined by the position of the lower pore in the dye, the transverse cut area of the dye, and the density of the powder
 is str par, tablet ke vajan kaa samaayojan saamaanya rup se nimna chhidr ko khiskaakar kiya jaataa he
 After filling the dye, the upper hole is lowered into the dye and the powder is compressed uniaxially between 5 and 20% porosity
 sampeedan ek yaa do charnon main ho sakati he or vanijyik utpaadan bahut teji se hota he
 Finally, the upper hole is drawn up and out of the dye and the tablet is lifted out of the dye to the lower hole until its upper surface is bleached from the upper part of the dye
 This process is repeated several times to produce only multiple tablets
 tablet nirmaan ke dauraan saamne aane vaali aam samasyaon main shaamil hai: The design and testing of the formulations of the tablet is done using a laboratory machine called tablet condensation simulator or powder compaction simulator
 yah ek computer niyantrit yukti he jo chhidr kii sthitiyon, chhidr ke dabaav, gharshan balon, daai kii diwaar ke dawaabon evam kabhi-kabhi sanghanan ghatana ke dauraan tablet ke aantarik taapmaana kii maap kar saktaa he
 Several experiments with small quantities of different mixtures can be used to optimize formulation
 ganitiya rup se sanshodhit chhidr kii gatiyon ko tablet utpaadan ke kisi bhi prakaar evam model ke anuroop banane ke liye kramadeshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Active drugs are very expensive to produce initial quantities of ingredients, and the use of condensation simulators reduces the amount of powder required for product development
 tablet press, jise tablet banane vaali mashin bhi kaha jaataa he, chote, ek baar main ek tablet taiyaar karne vaali prayogshaala main suvidhajanak dhang se istemaal karne ke liye upyukt, chaaron taraf keval aadhe ton ke daab vaale saste modelon se lekar vishaal, computarikrut, atyadhik daab ke saath prati ghante hajaaron se lekar lakhon tablet taiyaar kar sakane vaale vibhinn kism ke audyogic model hote hai
 The tablet press is an essential device for any drug and nutritional product manufacturer
 tablet ke aam nirmaataaon main shaamil hai fett, corsch, kikusui, menasti evam curtoy
 tablet press ko, parichaalak dwaara nichle evam upree chhidron kii sthiti ko sahi bhang se samyojit karne main sakasham bananaa chahie taaki tablet ke vajan, motaai or ghanatv main se prayek ko niyantrit kiya ja sake
 ise vibhinn kaimon, roleron evam / yaa pattiyon kaa upyog kar praapt kiya ja saktaa he jo tablet upkaran main kaary karte hai
 Mechanical systems are also incorporated to fill and remove the tablet from the press after dye filling and compression
 aushadh tablet kii press kii saaf-safai aasaani se ho jaani chahie or vibhinn upkaran ke saath pun: samanurup bhi jaldi se ho janaa chahie kyonki aam taur par vibhinn utpaadon ke nirmaan ke liye unka prayog kiya jaataa he
 Nowadays many tablets are coated after pressing
 haalanki chini kii coating pehle lokapriy thi, is prakriya main kai kamiyaan hai
 The coating of modern tablets is polymer and polysaccharide based, with a plasticizer and pigment added
 tablet kii coating sthaayee or itani adhik majboot honi chahie ki tablet ko rakhane-uthaane kaa kaary sah sake, coating prakriya ke dauraan tablet ko ek-saath chipakane nahin dena chahie or tablet ke upar udkeern sampratikon yaa pratik chinhon ko baarik samocch rekhaon ko apnaanaa chahie
 jin tablet ke swaad aruchikar hote hai unke liye coating aavashyak hoti he or ek adhik chikani banaavat, bade tablet ko nigalane main adhik aasaan banaati he
 The tablet's coating is also useful in extending the shelf life of components that are sensitive to moisture or oxidation
 apaardarshee padaarth jaise ki titanium dioxide prakaash ke prati samvedansheel kriyasheel padaarthon kii prakashakshinan se raksha kar sakate hai
 Special coating can increase brand recognition
 yadi kisi tablet kaa sakriy ghatak amla ke prati samvedansheel hota he yaa pet kii parat ke prati pradaahak hota he to ek antric lepan kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he jo pet ke amla ke liye pratirodhi hoti he or aanton ke kam amleey kshetra main ghul jaati he
 The intestinal coating is also used for drugs that can be adversely affected by the long time it takes to reach the small intestine, where they are absorbed
 aksar coating kaa chunaav jathrantriy path main aushadhi ke vighatan kii dar ko niyantrit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Some drugs are better absorbed in different places in the digestive system
 yadi kisi aushadhi kaa sabase adhik avasorana pet main hota he, to amla main shighrata or saralata se ghulne vaali coating kaa chayan kiya jayega
 yadi avasorana kii dar badi aant yaa brihadantra main sabase acchhee hoti he, to amlarodhi evam dhire-dhire ghulne vaali coating kaa prayog kiya jaataa he taaki yah sunishchit kiya ja sake ki ghulne se pehle yah sahi jagah tak pahunchati he
 Generally, the gastrointestinal tract with the best absorption for a particular drug is determined by clinical trials
 kabhi-kabhi tablet ko aadhe yaa chaturthansh hisse main vibhajit karnaa aavashyak hota he
 It is easier to break the tablet accurately when it is printed, but some devices called tablet separators are capable of breaking all types of tablets
 vishesh coating yukt tablet ko istemaal karne se pehle todaa nahin janaa chahie, kyonki yah tablet ke antarbhag ko pachak rason ke sampark main laakar iske vilamb se hone vaale prabhaav ko samaapt kar degaa

 Criticism of texts related to the Kathashakthya makes it clear that in Sanskrit literature there are examples of three types of stories which are presently called Feary Tales, Fabules and Dedactic Tales in Western countries
 kathaon ke mul strot kii khoj ke liye vaidic samhitaon kaa anushilan aavashyak he
 Many interesting stories are reported in the Rigveda's mantrashita, which is described by Shounak in "brihaddevata", Sdgurushishya in the Vedarthadipika of "katyayana Sarvanukramani", Yask in Nirukta, Sayan in his Vedic interpretations and Siadviveda in "niti Manjari"

 siikhnaa yaa adhigam ek vyapak satat evam jivan paryant chalanevaali mahatvapurn prakriya he
 Man starts learning only after birth and keeps learning something throughout his life
 dhire-dhire vah apane ko vaataavaran se samyojit karne kaa praytn karata he
 During this adjustment he tries to get the most out of his experiences
 is prakriya ko manovigyaan main siikhnaa kehete hai
 The more a person has the power to learn, the more his life develops
 seekhney kii prakriya main vyakti anek kriyaaain evam upakriyaaain karata he
 Hence learning is an active response to a situation
 udaahranarth - chote balak ke saamne jalataa deepak le janaper vah deepak kii lau ko pakadaney kaa prayaas karata he
 In this effort, his hand burns
 vah haath ko peeche khinch letaa he
 Whenever a lamp is brought before him, he does not raise his hand to catch the flame on the basis of his previous experience, but turns away from it
 isivichaar ko sthiti ke prati pratikriya karnaa kehete hai
 In other words, we can say that the child's natural behavior changes based on experience
 uparokt paribhaashaon se spasht hota he ki seekhney ke kaaran vyakti ke vyavhaar main parivartan aata he, vyavhaar main yah parivartan bahya evam aantarik donon hi prakaar kaa ho saktaa he
 Therefore, learning is a process in which permanent or temporary changes in behavior are seen through experience and training
 iel tharnadike america kaa prasiddh manovaigyanik hua he jisane seekhney ke kuch niyamon kii khoj kii jinhen nimnlikhit do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya gaya he– The three main rules of learning are as follows - 1
 tatparta kaa niyam - is niyam ke anusaar jab vyakti kisi kaary ko karne ke liye pehle se taiyaar rahata he to vah kaary use anand detaa he evam sheeghra hi sikh letaa he
 Conversely when a person is not ready to do the task or does not have the desire to learn, he gets annoyed or angry and the pace of learning is slow
 2
 abhyaas kaa niyam - is niyam ke anusaar vyakti jis kriya ko baar-baar karata he us sheeghra hi sikh jaataa he tathaa jis kriya ko chhod detaa he yaa bahut samay tak nahin karata use vah bhuulane lagatahe
 Such as- solving mathematics questions, typing, cycling etc
 ise upyog tathaa anupyog kaa niyam bhi kehete hai
 3
 Rule of Effect - According to this rule, the work that is done in life has a good effect on the person or gets happiness or satisfaction, he tries to learn and the actions which have a bad effect on the person
 He stops doing
 is niyam ko sukh tathaa dukh yaa puraskaar tathaa dand kaa niyam bhi kaha jaataa he
 1
 Multiple Response Rules - According to this rule, when a person encounters a new problem, he tries to find solutions to various reactions to solve it
 vah pratikriyaayen tab tak karata rahata he jab tak samasya kaa sahi hal na khoj le or uski samasyasulajh nahin jaati
 This gives him satisfaction, the principle of learning through the efforts and error of the Thorndike is based on this rule
 2
 maansik sthiti yaa manovriti kaa niyam - is niyam ke anusaar jab vyakti seekhney ke liye maansik rup se taiyaar rahata he to vah sheeghra hi sikh letaa he
 Conversely, if a person is not mentally ready to learn a task, then he will not be able to learn it
 3
 aanshik kriya kaa niyam - is niyam ke anusaar vyakti kisi samasya ko sulajhane ke liye anek kriyaayen praytn evam bhul ke aadhaar par karata he
 He uses his insight to find a solution to the problem with the help of partial actions
 4
 samanta kaa niyam - is niyam ke anusaar kisi samasya ke prastut hone par vyakti purv anubhav yaa paristhitiyon main samanta paye jane par uske anubhav swatah hi sthanantarit hokar seekhney main madd karte hai
 5
 The rule of associative change - According to this rule, the person starts to use the knowledge gained in other circumstances or towards a cooperative stimulus
 jaise-kute ke muh se bhojan saamagree ko dekh kar laar tapakarne lagati he
 But after some time, saliva starts dripping after looking at the food utensils
 siikhnaa chaaron ore ke parivesh se anukulan main sahaayta karata he
 After some time living in a particular socio-cultural environment, we understand the rules of that society and this is also what is expected of us
 ham parivaar, samaaj or apane kaaryakshe tra ke jimme daar naagarik evam sadsy ban jate hai
 This is possible only because of learning
 ham vibhinn prakaar ke kaushalon ko arjeet karne ke liye seekhney kaa hi prayog karte hai
 But the most complex question is how do we learn? manovaigyanikon ne maanvon evam pashuon par anek prakaar ke adhyayanon dwaara seekhney kii prakriya ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya he
 They have incorporated some methods that are used to generate simple and complex responses
 seekhney ke do mul prakaar hai - shastreey anubandhan or yantric yaa kriyaprasut anubandhan
 Apart from this, there are other types of verbal or literal learning, observation learning, skill learning, and suffix learning
 shastreey anubandhan ko powelav kaa siddhanth bhi kaha jaataa he kyonki iskaa avishkaar ek roosi vaigyanik evan pi
 powelav ne kiya tha jo uddipan or anukriya ke bich sambandhon kaa adhyayan karne main ruchi rakhte the
 He did studies on dogs
 ek kute ko baandhakar rakhaa gaya or prayogshaala sahaayak ne kute ke saamne bhojan prastut kiya
 Powlav found that the dog had learned the response to secrete saliva
 unhone anubandhan kii is vidhi par vistaar se adhyayan kiye
 Powlav made a series of attempts at the dog to attach sounds and food together
 seekhney ke is prayaas main dhwani or bhojan ko saath main sammilit kiya gaya
 The time to render the sound was very short and there was a difference of about 2 to 3 minutes between the sound and the presentation of food
 shuru ke kuch prayaason main kutta bhojan prastut ho ne par laar sravit karata tha
 Saliva secretion is a natural reaction on seeing food, hence saliva is said to be an unresponsive response
 baad ke prayaason main ghanti pehle bajaai gai uske baad khaanaa prastut kiya gaya
 After some experiments with bell and food together, the dog started secreting saliva as soon as the bell rang alone
 dhwani ko anubadhit uttejnaa kaha gaya kyon ki kute kaa anubandhan dhwani ke saath ho gaya or vah ghanti bajte hi laar sravit karne lagata tha
 The contraction of saliva secreted as soon as the bell rings
 yah paaya gaya he ki har prayaas main agar ghanti to bajaai jaati he parantu bhojan prastut nahin kiya jaataa to anubandhan kaa vilop ho jaataa he
 That is, no saliva will be secreted by the ringing of the bell, and if this is done continuously in many attempts, then the situation of deletion will occur
 yah bhi paaya gaya he ki wilo pen ke kuch interval ke pashchaat yadi ghanti bina bhojan ke bajaai jaati he to kutta ke val kuch prayaason tak phir se laar giraayegaa
 This state of the contracted response after deletion is called auto-change
 agar koi baccha samay se apana grihakaarya kar letaa he to uske mata-pita uski prashansa karte hai or baccha us kaary ko karnaa sikh jaataa he
 But if the child breaks a plate, he is rebuked or punished and the child learns not to repeat such behavior
 is prakaar ke anubandhan ko naimitthik anubandhan yaa kriyaprasut anubandhan kehete hai
 In other words it can be said that we learn to behave in which the results are positive and we stop doing the behavior which gives us negative results
 vyaavhaarik anubandhan seekhney kii vah vidhi he jisamen praani us vyavhaar ko doharaate hai jiskaa parinaam sakaaratmak ho ta he or us vyavhaar se bachataa he jiskaa parinaam nakaaratmak hota he
 Bf Skinner is the most influential scientist from a who has been most supportive of the role of active contracting in learning
 unhone chuhon par is anubandhan kaa prayog karne ke liye dibbe kaa nirmaan kiya jise skinner baks kaha jaataa he
 There was a lever in the front wall of this box
 liver ko dabaanaa hi vah anukriya thi jo chuuhe ko seekhni thi
 a hungry rat was placed inside this box, and he started doing different kinds of actions as he went inside
 kuch der baad achaanak usne vah liver dabaa diya jisase uske saamne rakhi plate main khaanaa aakar gir gaya
 And the rat ate that food
 bhojan khaane ke baad chuuhe ne pinjre main dubaara kriyaayen kerani shuru kar di
 After some activity, he again hit the lever and again the piece of food fell in front of him
 shaniah-shaniah chuha sari aniyamit gatividhiyaan band karke sirf liver ke chaaron taraf hi vishisht gatividhiyaan karne laga
 In the end, the rat learns that by pressing the liver, food is spilled in front of him, which was a satisfying result for him
 duusare shabdon main chuuhe dwaara liver ko dabaanaa bhojan pradaan karne vaala nimitt ban jaataa he
 The response by the rat was reinforced by which the rat acquired or learned this behavior
 bhojan praapt karne main liver ne chuuhe ke liye ek nimitt kii bhoomika nibhaai jisase chuuhe ko santushti praapt hui or isaliye is tarah ke seekhney ko yantric anubandhan bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is also called active contracting because the behavior of a rat or any animal is an action on the environment
 maanav dwaara siikhe hue adhikanshat vyavhaar kii vyakhya ham kriyaprasut anubandhan ke sahyog se kar sakate hai
 For example, parents and other officials punish every child's aggressive behavior and reward good behavior
 kriyaprasut anubandhan main punarbalan kii nirnaayak bhoomika he
 It can be negative or positive
 aaiye punarbalan ke donon prakaaron ko samajhane kaa praytn karte hai
 Any action that increases the number of responses is called reinforcement
 hamane skinner ke prayog main dekha ki chuha baar-baar liver dabaane kii anukriya karata he or bhojan praapt kar letaa he
 This is called positive reinforcement
 is prakaar ek sakaaratmak punarbalan yaa puraskaar vah pravriti he jisase us vishisht vyavhaar ke prabhaav ko bal miltaa he
 Positive reinforcement is any stimulus through which that specific response is strengthened
 
 The word 'negative' explains the nature of reinforcement
 yah punarbalan he kyon ki yah anukriyaaon kii sankhya main vruddhi karata he
 This method is called 'migration' learning because a rat can avoid shock if it presses the lever
 duusare tarah ke nakaaratmak punarbalan ke parinaam swaroop jo anubandhan ho ta he use bachaav dwaara siikhnaa kaha gaya jisamen chuha liver dabaakar aghat se batch saktaa he
 Negative reinforcement is used in learning by escape or rescue, and the creature escapes by escape or rescue
 ham kaise sahi anukriyaaon ko punarbalit kar sakate hai? yah nirantar yaa aanshik punarbalan ke prayog se ho saktaa he
 Continuous enforcing enforces the proper response of each
 udhaaharan ke liye jitani baar bhi chuha liver dabaata he use utani hi baar plate main bhojan prastut kiya jaataa he
 Alternatively, responses are sometimes reinforced with partial or occasional interruptions
 nirantar punarbalan ke milane se naye vyavhaar sthapit karne yaa sudrudh karne main bahut sahaayta milti he
 On the other hand partial reinforcement is more powerful in maintaining learned behavior
 prekshan dwaara siikhnaa tritiy mukhya vidhi he jiske dwaara ham sikh sakate hai
 Seeing the behavior of others and adopting their skills is very common
 yah din-pratidin ke jivan kaa ek hissaa he
 Learning by observation depends on the existence of a suitable ideal in a particular environment
 balak aise vyakti ko jise vah apana adarsh maanata he, koi kaary karte dekhtaa he to vah us vyavhaar ko apane main samahit kar letaa he
 For example, youngsters learn that behavior immediately by observing the aggressive behavior of others
 jab bachche tii
ve
 main hinsa kii ghatana dekhte hai to vah bhi us vyavhaar ko seekhney kaa prayaas karte hai
 Although the observation method is more complex than the simulation method
 bachche is vidhi dwaara soochnaaon or vibhinn kaushalon ko sikh to jate hai parantu uskaa prayog nahin kar pate hai
 Humans, especially youth, can be influenced mostly by positive methods if their ideals are appropriate
 aap is paath ko pard kar seekhney kii avadharana ko samajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, yah vaachik seekhney dwaara hi sambhav ho paa rahaa he
 You have learned the language
 sansar ke vibhinn bhaagon main log vibhinn bhashaaon ko sikhte hai
 The process of learning a language is called literal or verbal learning
 jab aap apni baalyavastha ko yaad karte hai to aap pate hai ki aapane bhashaa seekhney kii shuruuaat aksharon ko pahchaanane se kii thi
 Then learn the words and then the sentences
 jab aap vide shi bhashaa sikhte hai to aap yugal shabdon kaa prayo ga karte hai
 Psychologists study what methods are used in gradual learning and paired learning
 sanpratyayon ko siikhnaa ghatnaon or vastuon kii shreniyon ko viksit karne ke sambandh main he
 It is very important for our lives that we differentiate between things on the basis of a criterion
 udaahranarth balak, balika, fal or furniture sanpratyay kii shrenee main aate hai
 Many things come together under the theory
 vibhinn prakaar kii shreniyon kaa prayog athwa virgon ke naam hamen sampreshan or vibhinn kaaryaklap karne main madad karte hai
 Factors can be natural or artificial
 ve moort yaa amoort ho sakate hai
 Freedom, love and democracy are examples of abstract principles
 gaay, mej, balak, balika, santaraa tathaa gulab aadi moort sanpratyay ke udhaaharan hai
 While learning an idea, we respond in the same way to all kinds of sensations
 kisi sanpratyay ko sikhte samay ham kisi vishisht shrenee ke vibhinn uddipano ke liye ek hi tarah kii anukriya karte hai
 In this way, we use only the word table for all types of tables or the word child for all types of children
 vastutah sabhi prakaar kaa ucch shrenee kaa siikhnaa aavashyak rup se sanpratyay seekhney ko samahit karata he
 Factions help reduce the complexities of the world
 seekhney kaa ek mahatvapurn kshetra apane main vibhinn prakaar ke kaushalon ke uparjan ko samahit karata he jaise - cycle chalaanaa, lekhan, car chalaanaa, hawaii jahaaj chalaanaa, samooh kaa netritv karnaa, dusron ko protsaahit karnaa aadi
 We need skills for all these tasks
 ve log jo is prakaar ke kaushalon ko seekhney ke yogya hai unako jivan main vibhinn avasar praapt hote hai
 Once these skills are acquired, they can increase more
 ek baar in kaushalon ko sikh jane par yah swachaalit ho jate hai or vyakti inhen aaraam or suvidhapurvak kar saktaa he
 As a result people do the work voluntarily and can do more than one task at the same time
 yah ek ruchikar tathy he ki kisi ek kaary kaa siikhnaa us vishisht kaary tak hi simit nahin rah jaataa he
 The learned work can also be used in other circumstances
 kisi vyakti ke gyaan ke upyog karne kii kshamta, kaushalon or kisi bhi tarah kaa siikhnaa bahut saraahneey he
 If a child learns multiplication or division, he uses it not only in the classroom but also in the market and home when required
 prashikshan kaa sthaanantaran us prakriya ko ingit karata he jisamen vah pehle siikhe huye vyavhaar kaa nai paristhiti main upyog karata he
 If positive pre-learned is helpful in learning second time then it is positive transfer
 or agar purv siikhnaa duusare seekhney main baadhak he to vah nakaaratmak sthaanantaran he
 It can also be zero if learning of the former is neither helpful nor obstructing the latter
 he
 a good student uses every opportunity to learn as a good opportunity

 Changes in personality, interest or attitudes result from certain types of learning
