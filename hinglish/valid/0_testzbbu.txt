 Many Turkish mosques have been converted into museum houses such as the first mosque that came here, in the picture given here, the dome seems to be rebuilt, but in fact it removed the sculptures and cots of the Muslims from it and searched the old way under it
 Going because it was America before Islam spread to Turkey
 madhya asia kii kai masjidon roosi kabje ke dauraan band kii gai or duniya ne masjidon ko samay puraatatv kaa darja nahin diya isliye vah nasht ho gai
 Some work is being done on their security
 aadhunik masjidon par aisi khaati, nakaashi or mehnat nahin milti
 It is considered necessary for Muslims to keep the following points in the mosque
 agar koi gaiyr musalamin masjid main pravesh karnaa chaahate hai, un par bhi yahi baaten lagu hoti hai
 Taharat is very important in Islam
 ek haddees ke anusaar tahaarat hi aadha vishwaas he
 Therefore, to come to the mosque, it is necessary to be clean and clean, but wuzu you can come to the mosque
 musalmaan aksar makatab chintaa main masjidon main sthiti parivaar main thaharnaa vaid nahin masjid haraam or masjide nabavi main aisi sthiti main pravesh bhi jaays nahin
 The body should also be pure with veneer
 man kii tahaarat bhi bas ke anusaar aavashyak he yani bure vichaaron se bachanaa chahie
 Muslims consider the mosque to be the home of Allah no matter it belongs to any community of Muslims
 masjid main chuppi or samskruti or shayastagi kii taakid kii he ki namaaz or koran padhane vaale tang na hon
 Fight in mosques or refusal of essential things should be avoided, although collective matters can be discussed
 masjid main daudna yaa jor se kadam rakhana or unchi awaz main baat karnaa samskruti or shayastagi ke khilaaf he
 In the same way, doing any work that is difficult to pray, is not considered good, such as eating onion, garlic, radish or any other thing is forbidden, and in this connection the Hadiths sacred biography is also cited
 masjid main saafe vastra pahan kar aana chahie
 The women came wearing such clothes from which i am a curtain
 isi tarah purush uchit vastra pahan kar aae
 Generally, Muslims consider wearing Arabic clothes in addition to regional clothes and it is good and pleasant, but there is no such applause on clothes in Islam, but the clothes should be according to the principles of Islam
 praarambhik islam se purushon or mahilaon donon masjidon main aane kii anumati he lekin unhen alag jagah di jaati he
 According to Shari Islam, during the prayer, the cleansing of women lags behind men so that men do not lose sight of women
 paigambar sa alaihi va ke daur main purush or aurat donon masjid main namaaz adaa karte the haalanki mahilaon ke sammaan or suraksha ke liye behatar mana jaataa he ki vah ghar main namaaz adaa karen
 Nowadays mosques often have a separate place for women
 upmahadweep, paak or bhartiya mahilaon ke masjid main aane kaa rivaaj na ke baraabar he lekin yah islam se nahin balki bhartiya samaaj se he
 Women from Arab countries and modern Western countries visit mosques, offer prayers and participate in various educational activities
 samudri toofaan - ko japani bhashaa main sunami bolte hai, yani bandargah ke nikat kii lahar
 Actually, they are very long - that is, hundreds of kilometers in width, that is, the distance between the lower parts of the waves is hundreds of kilometers
 par jab ye tat ke paas aati hai, to laharon kaa nichalaa hissaa zamin ko chune lagata he,- inaki gati kam ho jaati he or oonchaai bad jaati he
 In such a situation, when they hit the coast, there is catastrophe
 gati 420 kilometre prati ghanta tak or oonchaai 10 se 18 meter tak
 That is, a running wall of saltwater
 aksar samudri bhukampon kii vajah se ye toofaan paidaa hote hai
 They are very common in the Pacific Ocean, but not in the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea
 isiilie shaayad bhartiya bhashaaon main inke liye vishisht naam nahin he
 When there is a very fast movement within the sea, a storm rises in it, causing a surge of long and very high waves that move with a strong impulse, these waves are called tsunamis
 darasal sunami japani shabd he jo su or nami se mil kar bana he su kaa arth he samudr tat auki nami kaa arth he lehren
 The first tsunami has also been taken as a rising tide in the sea, but it is not so
 darasal samudr main lehren chaand suraj or grahon ke gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav se uthati hai lekin sunami lehren in aam laharon se alag hoti hai
 The same thing happened on 11 / 03 / 2011 sunami laharon ke peeche vaise to kai kaaran hote hai lekin sabase zyada asardaar kaaran he bukamp
 iske alaava zamin dhansane, jwalamukhi fatne, kisi tarah kaa visphot hone or kabhi-kabhi ulkapaat ke asar se bhi sunami lehren uthati hai
 Whenever the upper layer of the sea suddenly moves forward due to a severe earthquake, the sea starts moving upwards in its parallel position
 jo lehren us vaqt banati hai wo sunami lehren hoti hai
 An example of this may be that the top layer of the earth is interlinked like the layers of football or that it is like an egg with cracks
 pehle sunami ko samudr main uthne vaale jowar ke rup main bhi liya jaataa rahaa he lekin aisa nahin he
 Actually, the moon flying in the sea rises under the influence of sun and planetary gravity, but tsunami waves are different from these common waves
 jaise andey kaa khol sakht hota he lekin uske bheetar kaa padaarth lizlija or geela hota he
 Due to the impact of the earthquake, these cracks widen and cause such a stir in the material inside that it quickly moves upwards
 dharti kii paraten bhi jab kisi bhi asar se chaudee hoti hai to wo khisakati hai jiske kaaran mahadweep banate hai
 So this way these tsunami waves are formed
 lekin ye bhi zaruri nahin ki har bukamp se sunami lehren bane
 For this, the center of the earthquake must be in or around the sea
 jab ye tsunami lehren kisi bhi mahadweep kii us parat ke uthle pani tak pahunchati hai jahaan se wo duusare mahadweep se judaa he or jo ki ek daraar ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 There the intensity of the tsunami wave decreases
 wo isliye kyon ki us jagah doosraa mahadweep bhi jud rahaa he or vahaan dharti kii judi hui parat kii vajah se daraar jaisi jo jagah hoti he wo pani ko apane andar rasta detii he
 But after that when the tsunami moves along the inner water towards the shore, it is so fast that it can rise up to 30 meters and whatever way trees, forests or buildings come in its way - can clear everything is
 sunami lehren samudri tat par bheeshan tareeke se hamalaa karti hai or jaan-maal kaa buree tarah nuqasaan kar sakati he
 These are difficult to predict
 jis tarah vaigyanik bukamp ke bare main bhavishya vaani nahin kar sakate vaise hi sunami ke bare main bhi andaaza nahin laga sakate
 But by looking at the record of the tsunami so far and the condition of the continents, scientists can make some guesses
 dharti kii jo plates yaa paraten jahaan-jahaan milti he vahaan ke aasapaas ke samudr main sunami kaa khatara zyaada hota he
 Like where the Australian layer and the Eurasian layer meet, there is Sumatra which is connected to the Philippine layer on the other side
 sunami laharon kaa kahar vahaan bhayankar rup main dekha ja rahaa he

 iqbaal or moulana mohammad ali johar ne mohammad ali jinna ko is maang kaa samarthan karne ko kaha

 lahore main 1940 ke muslim lig sammelan main jinna ne saafe taur par kaha ki vah do alag-alag raashtra chaahate hai Hindu organizations such as the Hindu Mahasabha were strongly opposed to the partition of India, but believed that there were differences between Hindus and Muslims
 1937 main elahabaad main hindu mahasabha ke sammelan main ek bhaashan main vir saavarkar ne kaha tha - aaj ke din bharat ek raashtra nahin he, yahan par do raashtra hai-hindu or musalmaan
 Most of the Congress leaders were secular and against partition of India on the basis of sect
 mahatma gandhi kaa vishwaas tha ki hindu or musalmaan saath rah sakate hai or unhen saath rahanaa chaiye
 He strongly opposed partition: "my whole soul revolts against the idea that Hindus and Muslims are two opposing views and cultures

 praayah adhikansh vibhaajanon main jis tarah vibhinn dharmik samudaayon ke bich jitani hinsa hui, usase kahin adhik hinsa is vibhaajan main hui
 This division of India by the imperial Britain is one of the four divisions it made

 Functional study of a language is done in grammar while the linguist goes on to do a very comprehensive study of the language
 adhyayan ke anek vishyon main se aajkal bhashaa-vigyaan ko vishesh mahatva diya ja rahaa he
 This language-related study has been named in Europe with many names and nouns till date
 sarvapratham is adhyayan ko philology shabd ke aage visheshan ke rup main ek shabd joda gaya- tab ise ‘‘comparative philology’’ kah kar pukaara gaya
 Until the nineteenth century, grammar and linguistic studies were often considered to be the same
 atah ise vidwaanon ne 'comparative grammer' naam bhi diya
 In France it was named Langistić
 france main bhashaa sambandhi kaary adhik hone ke kaaran unnisvin sadi main sampoorn europe main hi "linguistique" athwa "linguistics" naam hi prachlit rahaa he
 Apart from this, other names like 'science of Language', 'glutology' etc
 also came in handy to reveal this subject
 aaj in sabhi naamon main se ‘‘linguisticks’’, ‘‘philology’’ maatr hi prayog main laae jate hai
 In addition to all these European names in India, the names which are used in Hindi language are as follows - "bhasha-shastra", "bhasha-tattva", "bhasha-sasti", and "" Comparative linguistics "etc
 in sabhi naamon main se sarv prachlit naam ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’ he
 All the names, ancient and new, appear to be synonymous in these names
 atah yahi naam is shaastra ke liye sarvatha upyukt prathit hota he
 In its present form, linguistics is said to be the brain of Western scholars
 ati pracheen kaal se hi bhashaa-sambandhi adhyayan kii pravriti sanskrit-sahitya main pai jaati he
 a subtle discussion on language is available in Vedang called 'shiksha'
 dhvaniyon ke uccharan- avyav, sthaan, praytn aadi kaa in granthon main vistrut varnan uplabdh he
 Scientific analysis can be called scientific study of the language on the subjects' etymology, metal, prefix-suffixes etc
 in 'pratishyakhya' and Nirukta
 bhartruhari ke granth ‘vaakya padiya’ ke antargat ‘shabd’ ke swaroop kaa sookshm, gahan evam vyapak chintan uplabdh hota he
 There the word is envisaged as 'brahman' and its 'letter' is described as a noun
 prakaaraantar se yah ek bhashaa-adhyayan sambandhi granth hi he
 In Sanskrit literature, even in philosophical and literary texts, we get indications of language scientific discussions only under the subtle interpretation of the words' meaning ',' rasa ',' bhava ',' language available here and there in Sanskrit literature
 -conceptual material can certainly be called the cornerstone of current linguistics
 aadhunik vishay ke rup main bhashaa-vigyaan kaa sutarapaat europe main san 1786 i0 main sar wiliam jones naamak vidwaan dwaara kiya gaya mana jaataa he
 In the context of the study of Sanskrit language, Sir William Jones had first done a comparative study of Sanskrit, Greek and Latin language and expressed the possibility that at least one of the languages forms the basis of these three languages
 atah in teenon bhashaaon ke bich ek sookshm sambandh sutara avashya vidyaman he
 This type of comparative study of languages became the first step in the field of modern linguistics
 ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’ naam main do padon kaa prayog hua he
 "language" and "science"
 bhashaa-vigyaan ko samajhane se purv in donon shabdon se parichit hona aavashyak prathit hota he
 The word 'bhasha' is derived from the Sanskrit "bhash" metal
 jiskaa arth he-vyakt vaak 
 The word 'science' is formed by applying the prefix 'v' and 'lute' from the 'known' metal
 saamaanya rup se ‘bhashaa’ kaa arth he ‘bol chaal kii bhashaa yaa boli’ tathaa ‘vigyaan’ kaa arth he ‘vishesh gyaan’, kintu ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ shabd main prayukt in donon padon kaa spasht or vyapak arth samaj lene par hi ham is naam kii sargarbhitako jaanane main safal honge
 So, here we try to explain the broad meaning of both these terms
 bhashahmanav ek saamaajik praani he
 The need to convey our feelings and thoughts to each other in the society has been felt since time immemorial
 is prakaar bhashaa kaa astitva maanav samaaj main ati pracheen siddh hota he
 Language serves as an important tool for publishing the entire knowledge of human beings, to know the history of civilization and culture
 hamaare purvapurushon se sabhi saadhaaran or asaadhaaran anubhav ham bhashaa ke madhyam se hi jaan sake hai
 Knowledge from all our scriptures and scriptures is dependent on language
 mahakavi dandi ne apane mahaan granth ‘kavyadarsh’ main bhashaa kii mahatta suchit karte hue likhaa haih- That is, this entire Bhuvan would have become dark, if the word-form light in the world was not the light of language
 spasht hi he ki yah kathan maanav bhashaa ko lakshya karke hi kaha gaya he
 The sounds that animals and birds take shelter to express their expressions may be language for them, but due to being ambiguous to humans, scholars have called it 'latent speech', which is language- Nothing matters from the point of view of science
 kyonki ‘avyakt vaak’ main shabd or arth donon hi aspasht bane rahete hai
 Humans also sometimes use signs of limbs, fidgeting, hand-to-feet, face etc
 to express their feelings, but in spite of being a language, it is not 'express speech'
 maanav bhashaa kii sabase badi visheshta yah hoti he ki vah ‘vyakt vaak’ arthath shabd or arth kii spashtataa liye hue hoti he
 According to Patanjali, the author of Mahabhashya, 'express speech' refers to the descriptive language
 yah satya he ki kabhi-kabhi sanketon or angabhangimaaon kii sahaayta se bhi hamaare bhav or vichaaron kaa preshan badi saralata se ho jaataa he
 In this way, those gestures become symbols of language, but the most appropriate means of expressing human emotion is the descriptive language which has been given the noun of 'express speech'
 is main vibhinn arthon ko prakat karne ke liye kuch nischit uccharit yaa kathith dhvaniyon kaa aashray liya jaataa he
 Therefore, language is called a group of words which are filled with signs of different meanings
 jinke dwaara ham apane manobhaav saralata se dusron ke prati prakat kar sakate hai
 Thus, while defining the language, we can call it a medium adopted to exchange thoughts and expressions in human society, which holds the meaningful basis for the sounds that have been effortlessly ejected from the utterances of humans
 wo dhwani-samooh shabd kaa rup tab lete hai jab ve kisi arth se jud jate hai
 Entire phonology is based on a 'random' relationship with its meaning
 ‘yadrichhik’ kaa arth he purnataya kalpit
 In short, we call that word group pronounced with different meanings expressed in different meanings through which we convey our feelings and thoughts to others
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke adhyayan se hamen anek laabh hote hai, jaise- 1
 Satisfaction of curiosity or elimination of doubts about your familiar language
 2
 aitihaasik tathaa pragaitihaasik samskruti kaa parichay
 3
 Introduction to mental development of any caste or entire humanity
 4
 pracheen sahitya kaa arth, uccharan evam prayog sambandhi anek samasyaon kaa samaadhaan
 5
 Development of a language for the world
 6
 videshi bhashaaon ko seekhney main sahaayta
 7
 Assistance in the development and manufacture of translation and self-typing and similar machines
 8
 bhashaa, lipi aadi main saralata, shuddhta aadi kii drushti se parivartan-parivardhan main sahaayta
 In view of all these benefits, linguistics is considered to be a very useful subject in today's age and its field of study is constantly developing
 bhashaa ek prakritik vastu he jo maanav ko ishwariya vardaan ke rup main mili hui he
 Language is formed by naturally sounding sounds from the mouth of man
 bhashaa kaa saamaanya gyaan iske bolne or sunne vaale sabhi ko ho jaataa he
 This is called general knowledge of language
 iske aage, bhashaa kab bani, kaise bani ? iskaa praarambhik evam pracheen swaroop kya tha ? isamen kab-kab, kya-kya parivartan hue or un parivartanon ke kya kaaran hai ? athwa kul milakar bhashaa kaise viksit hui ? us vikaas ke kya kaaran hai ? koun si bhashaa kis duusari bhashaa se kitni samanta yaa vishmata rakhti he ? yah sab bhashaa kaa vishesh gyaan yaa ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ kaha jayega
 This particular form of linguistics, ie linguistics, has been considered as an important subject of study today
 bhashaa-vigyaan jab adhyayan ke vishyon main badi-badi kakshaon ke paathyakramon ke antargat sammilit kiya gaya to sarvapratham yah ek swaabhaavik prashn utpann hua ki bhashaa-vigyaan ko kala ke antargat gina jaae yaa vigyaan main
 That is, linguistics is art or science
 adhyayan kii prakriya evam nishkarshon ko lekar nishchay kiya jane laga ki vastutah use bhautik vigyaan, evam rasayan vigyaan aadi kii bhanti vishuddh vigyaan mana jaae athwa chitra, sangeet, murti, kavy aadi kalaon kii bhanti kala ke rup main sweekaar kiya jaae
 Art is related to human beings objects or subjects
 yahi kaaran he ki kala vyakti pradhan yaa purnatah vaiyaktik hoti he
 Apart from being relative, a particular country and period also have an influence on art
 iskaa abhipraay yah he ki kisi kaal main kala ke prati jo mulya rahete hai unamem kaalaantar main naye-naye parivartan upasthit ho jate hai tathaa ve kisi duusare desh main bhi maan liye jaaen, yah bhi aavashyak nahin he
 a person is feeling high artistic expression in an object
 kintu duusare ko vah is prakaar kii na lag rahi ho
 Therefore, the perception of art varies from person to person
 kala kaa sambandh maanav hriday kii ragatmik vritti se hota he
 There is a mixture of aesthetics of the person in it
 kala kaa uddeshy bhi soundaryanubhuti karana, yaa anand pradaan karnaa he, kisi vastu kaa tathvik vishleshan karnaa nahin
 The test of all these characteristics of the nature of art shows that linguistics is not art
 kyonki uskaa sambandh hriday kii sarasata-vritti se na hokar buddhi kii tatvagrahi drushti se hota he
 The aim of linguistics is not to provide beauty or entertainment
 vah to hamaare bauddhik chintan ko prakhar banaata he
 Elemental assessment of the existence of language
 uskaa drushtikon buddhivaadee he
 The findings of linguistics do not change on the basis of any person, nation or period and the basic basis of the study of linguistics, which is language, is not a humanized substance
 atah bhashaa-vigyaan ko ham kala ke kshetra main nahin gin sakate
 The usefulness of linguistics is that it teaches the art of language teaching
 isi kaaran sweet ne vyakaran ko bhashaa ko kala tathaa vigyaan donon kaha he
 Pure pronunciation, effective use of language can be placed in the category of art
 bhashaa-vigyaan ko kala kii seemaa main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa, yah nishchay ho jane par yah prashn uthta he ki kya bhashaa-vigyaan, bhautik-shaastra, rasayan-vigyaan aadi vishyon kii bhanti purnatah vigyaan he ? In the belief of many scholars, linguistics is not a pure science
 unki dharna ke anusaar abhi bhashaa-vigyaan ke sabhi prayog purnataa ko praapt nahin hue hai or uske nishkarshon ko isiilie antim nishkarsh nahin kaha ja saktaa
 At the same time, not all conclusions of linguistics are as universal and eternal as science
 jis prakaar ganit shaastra main 2 + 2 = 4 saarvkalik, vikalparahit nishkarsh he jo sarvatra sweekaar kiya jaataa he, bhashaa-vigyaan ke paas is prakaar ke vikalp-rahit nirvivaad nishkarsh nahin he
 In science, facts are compiled and analyzed, and the laws of sound are mostly non-committal, so according to some scholars, linguistics can be placed between humanities and science
 vichaar karne par ham dekhte hai ki vigyaan kii aaj kii durat pragati main prayek vishesh gyaan apane aagaamee gyaan ke saamne purana or avaigyanik siddh hota ja rahaa he
 In today's era of continual innovators, the scientific view is constantly going from micro to micro and new to new
 aaj ke viksit gyaan-kshetra ko dekhte hue kai vaigyanik manyataayen puraani or feeki pad gai he
 Newton's theory of light is also now being viewed with suspicion
 isse yah siddh hota ho jaataa he ki nutan gyaan ke prakaash main puraatan gyaan bhi vigyaan ke kshetra se baahar kar diya jaataa he
 Therefore, considering it from the point of view of pure knowledge, we find linguistics within the range of science itself
 bhashaa-vigyaan nishchay hi ek vigyaan he jiske antargat ham bhashaa kaa vishesh gyaan praapt karte hai
 It is true that linguistics has not yet been fully developed on a scientific level
 yahi kaaran he ki prasiddh grim-niyam ke aage chal kar grassmaan or varnor ko usamen sudhaar karnaa padaa he
 Prior to the above reforms, the sound rule of Grimm was considered to be the definite rule and even after the reforms it is considered to be the definite rule
 is prakaar naye gyaan ke prakaash main puraane siddhanton kaa khandan hone se vigyaan kaa koi virodh nahin he
 Actually this is pure science
 san 1930 ke baad jahaan varnanaatmak bhashaa-vigyaan ko punah mahatva praapt hua, vahaan tab se lekar aaj tak drut gati main vikaas hua he
 Ever since new tests have started with the help of instruments in the field of sound and the conclusions obtained have started to be completely regular, since then linguistics has gradually started to be considered in the category of science
 vigyaan kii ek badi visheshta he uskaa prayogtmak hona
 After American scholar Baloom Field, American linguists have developed experimental linguistics with great intensity as a new method of linguistics with phonology and morphology etc
 is paddati ke antargat bhashaa-vigyaan prayogshaalaon kaa vishay banataa ja rahaa he or uske liye anek yantron kaa avishkaar ho gaya he
 Seeing this, this subject will definitely be called science, there is no doubt in it at all
 aajkal jabaki samaaj-vigyaan, manovigyaan aadi shastreey vishyon ke liye jahaan vigyaan shabd kaa prayog karne kii parampara chal padi he tab shuddh kaaran-kaary parampara par aadhaarit bhashaa-vigyaan ko vigyaan kahana kisi bhi drushti se anuchit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Dr
 Shyamsunder Das has written in his book Language Secret- mangal dev shastri ke shabdon main- This definition is given in Dr
 Bholanath Tiwari's 'linguistics' text as follows- upar di gai sabhi paribhaashaon par vichaar karne se gyaat hota he ki unamem paraspar koi antar nahin he
 In the definition of Dr
 Shyamsunder Das, where the focus has been on linguistics only, Mangaldev Shastri and Bholanath Tiwari have included the types of study of linguistics in their definitions
 paribhaasha vah acchhee hoti he jo sankshipt ho or spasht ho
 Thus, we can give a new definition of linguistics in this way - "the study by which the study of human languages is subtle and analytical is called linguistics
" ” In other words, linguistics is that in which subtle and extensive scientific study of human languages is done
 bhashaa ke prachlit vartmaan swaroop ko chhod kar shesh sari adhyayan saamagree bhashaa-vigyaan ko sahitya se hi uplabdh hoti he
 If Sanskrit, Greek and Avesta literature were not in front of us today, linguistics would never have been successful in knowing that these three languages originated from any one native language
 isi prakaar adikaal se lekar aadhunik kaal tak kaa hindi sahitya hamaare saamne na hota to bhashaa-vigyaan hindi bhashaa ke aitihaasik vikaas kaa adhyayan kis prakaar kar paata
 Linguistics to study language in any way, he has to take help of literature on foot
 bundelkhand ke natkhat baalkon ke munh se yah sun kar- The grammar says what a problem this is, only the study of ancient literature will tell him that this is the impaired form of the first sutra of Shaktayan, 'un Namah Siddham'
 sahitya bhi bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta se apni anek samasyaon kaa samaadhaan khojane main safal ho jaataa he
 Dr
 Vasudev Sharan Aggarwal has clarified their meanings by linking many words of 'padmavat' with their original forms, validated on the basis of linguistic principles
 saath hi shuddh paath ke nirdhaaran main bhi isse paryaapt sahaayta lee he
 Hence, both literature and linguistics are supportive of each other
 bhashaa hamaare bhaavon-vichaaron arthath man kaa pratibimb hoti he atah bhashaa kii sahaayta se bahut se samasyaon ko suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Economics in particular is completely based on psychology
 vaakya-vigyaan ke adhyayan main bhi manovigyaan se paryaapt sahaayta milti he
 Sometimes psychology also helps us to know the cause of sound changes
 bhashaa kii utpatti tathaa praarambhik rup kii jaankaree main bhi bal-manovigyaan tathaa aviksit logon kaa manovigyaan hamaari sahaayta karata he
 Psychology also has to seek help from linguistics in its medical practice to know the meaning of the patient
 atah bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta se ek manovigyaani rogi kii manogranthiyon kaa pataa lagane main safal ho saktaa he
 Due to the close relationship between linguistics and psychology, a new study method is being developed nowadays called Language Psychology or Psycholinguistics
 bhashaa mukh se nikalne vaali dhwani ko kehete hai atah bhashaa-vigyaan main hawa bheetar se kaise chalati he, swaryantr, swartantri, nasikavivar, kauwa, taalu, daant, jeebh, onth, kanth, moorddha tathaa naak ke kaaran usamen kya parivartan hote hai tathaa kaan dwaara kaise dhwani grahan kii jaati he, in sabakaa adhyayan karnaa padataa he
 Physiology only helps him in this
 likhit bhashaa kaa grahan aankh dwaara hota he or is prakriya kaa adhyayan bhi bhashaa-vigyaan ke antargat hi hota he
 For this also he has to be indebted to physiology
 bhashaa-vigyaan or bhugol kaa bhi-gaharaa sambandh he
 According to some people, the geographical conditions of a place have a profound influence on its language
 kisi sthaan main boli jane vaali bhashaa main vahaan ke ped-paudhe, pakshi, jeev-jantu evam ann aadi ke liye shabd avashya milte hai parantu yadi unamem se kisi kii samaapti ho jaae to uskaa naam vahaan kii bhashaa se bhi juda ho jaataa hai
 The word 'somlata' is not used in our language today
 is lop kaa kaaran sambhavtah bhugolic hi he
 Geographic conditions are also the result of lack of a language spread in a place, less development in language and many dialects in a place
 durgam parvaton par rahane vaali jatiyon kaa paraspar kam sampark hone ke kaaran unki boli prasar nahin kar paati
 The dialect of people living across rivers differs from the common language
 deshon, nagaron, nadiyon tathaa praanton aadi ke naamon kaa bhashaa-vaigyanik adhyayan karne main bhugol badi manoranjak saamagree pradaan karata he
 Even in the field of economics, geography helps linguistics
 ‘ushtr’ kaa arth bhainsa se oont kaise ho gaya tathaa ‘saindhav’ kaa arth ghoda or namak hi kyon hua, aadi samasyaon par vichaar karne main bhi bhugol sahaayta karata he
 language-geography, a branch of linguistics, is just like geography
 isi prakaar kisi sthaan ke pragautihaasik kaal ke bhugol kaa adhyayan karne main bhashaa-vigyaan bhi paryaapt sahaayak hota he
 History is also closely related to linguistics
 itihaas ke teen roopon raajnneetik itihaas, dharmik itihaas, saamaajik itihaas-ko lekar yahan bhashaa-vigyaan se uskaa sambandh dikhalaayaa ja rahaa he- Other areas of knowledge like logic, physics and anthropology also provide great help in the study of linguistics
 manushya main anek prakaar ke andhvishwaas ghar kar lete hai jinka uski bhashaa par prabhaav padataa he
 In Indian society, women take their husbands' names in a twisted way, not outright
 raatri main vishaal keedon kaa naam nahin liya jaataa he
 They name their boy Mange, Chedi, Bechu, Ghurahu, Katwaru Alichar or Lendha, etc
 andhvishwaason ke atirikt anya bahut si saamaajik-manovigyaan se sambaddh gutthiyon ke spashtikaran ke liye maanav-vigyaan kii shakha-prashakhaon kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 In this way, many fields of knowledge- culture-studies, pedagogy, statistics, text-science, etc
 have a deep connection with linguistics
 maanav kii bhashaa kaa jo kshetra he vahi bhashaa-vigyaan kaa kshetra he
 The languages and dialects of civilized and uncivilized humans around the world are studied under linguistics
 is prakaar bhashaa-vigyaan keval sabhy-saahitiyik bhashaaon kaa hi adhyayan nahin karata apitu asabhy-barbar-asaahitiyik boliyon kaa, jo prachlan main nahin he, ateet ke garv main khoi hui hai un bhashaaon kaa bhi adhyayan iske antargat hota he
 Linguistics is divided into language structure and 'study of meaning' from the point of view of subject division
 isamen bhashaa kaa vaigyanik drushtikon se vishleshan or varnan karne ke saath hi vibhinn bhashaaon ke bich tulanaatmak adhyayan bhi kiya jaataa he
 Linguistics has two sides - elemental and applied
 iske atirikt bhashavigyaan kaa gyaan-vigyaan kii anyaanya shakhaon ke saath gaharaa sambandh he
 This has led to the development of various branches of sociolinguistics, psychodynamics, academic linguistics, etc
 bhashavigyaan ke gaun kshetra nimnlikhit hai- Syntax: In language, all thought-exchange is done on the basis of sentences
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke jis vibhaag main is par vichaar kiya jaataa he use vaakya-vichaar yaa vaakya-vigyaan kehete hai
 It has three forms - vaakya-rachana kaa sambandh bolanewaale samaaj ke manovigyaan se hota he
 Therefore this branch of linguistics is very difficult
 rup-vigyaan : vaakya kii rachana padon yaa roopon ke aadhaar par hoti he
 Therefore, the idea of verse or form becomes important after a sentence
 rup-vigyaan ke antargat dhaatu, upsarg, pratyay aadi un sabhi upkarnon par vichaar karnaa padataa he jinase rup banate hai
 Phonology: The base word of form or verse
 shabdon par rachana yaa itihaas in do drushtiyon se vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 The idea of a person or language is also done under it
 kosh-nirmaan tathaa vyutpatti-shaastra shabd-vigyaan ke hi vichaar-kshetra kii seemaa main aate hai
 The cultural history of the speaker can be known on the basis of the word group of the language
 dhwani-vigyaan : shabd kaa aadhaar he dhwani
 Sounds are studied in many ways under phonology
 iske antargat dhwani-shaastra ek alag se upavibhag he jisamen dhwani utpann karne vaale angon-mukh-vivar, nasika-vivar, swar tantri, dhwani yantra ke saath-saath sunne kii prakriya kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 There are two forms of this study - historical and second comparative
 grim niyam kaa sambandh isi se he
 Economics: The outer part of the sentence ends on the sound
 It is the outer body of the language, next to it the field of his soul begins which we call the meaning
 arth-rahit shabd atmarahit sharir kii bhanti vyarth hota he
 Therefore, meaning is an important part of language
 arth-vigyaan main shabdon ke arthon kaa vikaas tathaa uske kaarnon par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 We call any study a scientist when we follow a certain process in it
 bhashaa vigyaan bhi kisi bhashaa ke kaaran-kaaryparak yuktipurna vivechan-vishleshan ke liye kuch nishchit prakriyaaon main bandha kar chalata he
 On the basis of these processes, so far we have received five types of studies of linguistics- saamanyatya bhashaa kaa adhyayan nimnaankit drushtiyon se kiya jaataa he : By descriptive method, the form of one language of the same period is analyzed
 iske liye isamen un siddhanton par prakaash daalaa jaataa, jinke aadhaar par bhashaa-vishesh kii rachanaagat visheshtaon ko spasht kiya ja sake
 It is important to note that in this method language cannot be included in different periods simultaneously, because the analysis of language of every age will have the purpose of separate principles
 panini na keval bharat ke, apitu sansar ke sabase bade bhashavigyaani hai, jinhone varnanaatmak rup main bhashaa kaa vishad evam vyapak adhyayan kiya
 Katyayan and Patanjali also fall in this category
 greek vidwaanon main thraiks, discolas tathaa erodian ne bhi is kshetra main ullekhya kaary kiya tha
 Fully influenced by Panini, Bloomfield paved the way for the development of descriptive linguistics by publishing his book 'language' in 1932 AD
 idhar pashchimi deshon - visheshkar america main varnanaatmak bhashavigyaan kaa aashaatheet vikaas hua he
 The purpose of historical linguistics is to consider changes in different periods in a language and to formulate theories in relation to those changes
 varnanaatmak paddati kaa mul antar yah he ki varnanaatmak paddati jahaan ekakalik he, vahaan aitihaasik paddati dvikalik
 The antiquity of the Sanskrit language attracted the attention of linguists towards the historical method
 'filology' kaa mukhya pratipaadya pracheen granthon kii bhashaaon kaa tulanatamak adhyayan hi tha
 The focus of the scholars was mainly on languages like Sanskrit, German, Greek, Latin
 fredrick ougust woolf ne san 1777 i
 main hi aitihaasik paddati kii ore vidwaanon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya tha
 In fact, to understand the developmental form of any language one has to resort to historical method
 puraani hindi athwa madhyakaalin hindi or aadhunik hindi main kya parivartan hua he, ise aitihaasik paddati dwaara hi spasht kiya ja saktaa he
 Two or more languages are compared by comparative method
 ise mishrit paddati bhi kah sakate hai, kyonki vivarnaatmak paddati tathaa aitihaasik paddati donon kaa aadhaar liya jaataa he
 One has to define a period for description and at least two languages are required for comparison
 is prakaar, tulanaatmak paddati ko varnanaatmak paddati or aitihaasik paddati kaa yoga kaha ja saktaa he
 The comparative method can apply to any two languages
 jaise, bhartiya bhashaaon - bhojpuri aadi main bhi paraspar tulana kii jaati he yaa phir hindi-angareji, hindi-roosi, hindi-farsi kaa bhi tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 That is, there is no territorial limit
 wiliam jones, france bopp, maxmooler, curtius, ougust shlikhar prabhruti vidwaanon ne tulanaatmak bhashavigyaan ke vikaas main mahatvapurn yogadan kiya he
 However, so far there is a great lack of principles in comparative linguistics, on the basis of which the classification of two different languages could not become scientific
 sanrachanaatmak paddati varnanaatmak paddati kii agali kadi he
 This method is getting special publicity in America
 isamen yantric upkarnon ko adhik mahatva diya ja rahaa he, jisase anuwaad karne main vishesh suvidha hogi
 Jaelig Harris developed this method by writing a book titled 'methods in Structural Linguistics'
 vigyaan kii anya shakhaon ke samaan bhashavigyaan ke bhi prayogtmak paksh hai, jinke liye prayog kii pranaaliyon or prayogshaala kii apeksha hoti he
 Phonetic phonology, physical phonology and auditory phonology are studied by various mechanical experiments
 ise praayogic swanvigyaan, yantric swanvigyaan yaa prayogshaala swanvigyaan bhi kehete hai
 In this, from simple equipment like mirrors to the most complex electrical devices are being used
 parinamswaroop bhashavigyaan ke kshetra main ganitagyon, bhautikashastriyon or enginiaron kaa purna sahyog apekshit ho gaya he
 With the help of the artificial palate and artificial palate projectors, the pronunciation space of the unmarked swans is tested by the individual
 kaaymograph swaanon kaa ghoshnatv or pranatv nirdhaaran karne anunasikta or kaalamaatra jaanane ke liye upyogi he
 Laryngeal scope studies the position of the larynx
 endoscope laringoscope kaa hi sudhara rup he
 The waves of the oscillograph imprint the physical appearance of the swans on the screen or on the film with great clarity
 yahi kaam spectograph yaa sonograph dwaara adhik safalataa se kiya jaataa he
 The images that the spectrograph presents can be heard again by pattern playback
 spichstrechar kii sahaayta se ricard kii hui saamagree ko dhimi gati se suna ja saktaa he
 Apart from these, there are other small and large instruments, from which adequate help is being taken in linguistic studies
 francisi bhashavaigyanikon main ruiyo ne swanvigyaan ke prayogon ke vishay main granth likhaa tha
 In London, Prof
 Firth developed a special palate
 swaron ke maapan ke liye jaise swaratrikon yaa chatushkon kii rekhaayen nirdhaarit kii gai hai, vaise hi inhone vyanjanon ke maapan ke liye aadhaar rekhaon kaa nirupan kiya, jinke dwaara uccharan sthanon kaa thik thik varnan kiya ja saktaa he
 Daniel Janse and Ida Ward have also done important work on English phonology
 francisi, german or roosi bhashaaon ke swanvigyaan par kaam karne waalon main kramash: armastrong, bithel or boyanas mukhya hai
 Among the people who work on theoretical and applied phonology equally, the following are the main ones: Stetson, Negus Potter, Green and Cop, Martin Juice, Hefner, Maul etc
 idhar ek nayaa yantric prayaas aarambh hua he jiskaa sambandh shabdaawalee, arthtatv tathaa vyakaranik roopon se he

 Ahalya or Ahalya is a female character mentioned in Hindu myths, who was the wife of the sage Gautama
 brahmanon or puraanon main inaki katha chhitput rup se kai jagah praapt hoti he or ramayana or baad kii ramakathaon main vistaar se inaki katha varnit he
 The story of Ahalya, one of the most beautiful women in the world composed by Brahma, is mainly in the form of her defacement by Indra and as a result of being cursed by Gautama and cursed by Rama's feet
 hindu parampara main inhen, sristi kii pavithratam paanch kanyaon, panchakanyaon main se ek gina jaataa he or inhen praatah smaraneey mana jaataa he
 According to the belief, the name of these Panchakanya mornings in the morning destroys all sins
 ahalya shabd do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he:a or halya, jiskaa sanskrit arth hal, hal jotane athwa virupata se sambandhit he
 In the Uttara Kanda of the Ramayana, it is explained by Brahma without any disharmony, where Brahma is telling Indra how he took elements from the beautiful creations of the universe and created them by incorporating them into the organs of Ahalya
 gyanmandal, varanasi prakashit aadhunik kosh isi arth ko lekar likhata he: "ahalya- hal kaa arth he kurup, atah kurupata na hone ke kaaran brahma ne inhen ahalya naam diya
 " chunki, katipay sanskrit shabdkosh ahalya kaa arth aisi bhoomi jise jota na gaya ho likhte hai, baad ke lekhak ise purush samagam se jodakar dekhte huye, ahalya ko kumari athwa akshata ke rup main nirupit karte hai
 This fits with the tradition in which it is believed that Ahalya was in many ways free of Indra's lips and out of his reach
 haalaanki, rabindranath tagore, "ahalya" kaa abhidhaatmak arth "jise jota na ja sake" maanate hue use prastaravat nirupit karte hai jise ram ke charansparsh ne urvar bana diya
 Professor Bharti Jhaveri of the University of Delhi supports Ravindranath's view, according to the Ramayana, in the oral tradition of the Bhil tribe and refers to it as "a land that has not been plowed"
 ram or lakshmana rishi vishwamitra ke saath mithilapuri ke van upavan aadi dekhne ke liye nikle to unhone ek upavan main ek nirjan sthaan dekha
 Ram said, "lord! Seeing this place looks like an ashram, but what is the reason that no sage or saint is seen here?" vishwamitra ji ne bataaya, yah sthaan kabhi maharishi gautam kaa ashram tha
 He used to do austerities by staying here with his wife
 ek din jab gautam rishi ashram ke baahar gayi huye the to unki anupasthiti main indra ne gautam rishi ke vesh main aakar ahilya se pranay yachana kii
 Although Ahalya did not recognize Indra, knowing Rishi Gautama, Ahalya gave her approval for love
 jab indra apane lok laut rahe the tabhi apane ashram ko waapas aate huye gautam rishi kii drushti indra par padi jo unheen kaa vesh dhaaran kiye huye tha
 He understood everything and cursed Indra
 iske baad unhone apni patni ko shaap diya ki re duraachaarini! tu hajaaron varshon tak keval hawa pikar ksht uthaati hui yahan raakh main padi rahe
 When Rama enters this forest, only then will you be saved by his grace
 tabhi tu apana purv sharir dhaaran karke mere paas aa sakegi
 Saying this, Gautam Rishi left this ashram and went to the Himalayas and started doing penance
 isaliye vishwamitra ji ne kaha "he ram! ab tum ashram ke andar jaakar ahilya kaa uddhaar karo
 "both brothers entered the ashram after listening to Vishwamitra
 vahaan tapasya main nirat ahilya kahin dikhaai nahin de rahi thi, keval uskaa tej sampoorn vaataavaran main vyaapt ho rahaa tha
 When Ahalya's vision fell upon Rama, she received her holy vision and once again started to appear as a beautiful woman
 nari rup main ahilya ko sammukh paakar ram or lakshmana ne shraddhapurvak unke charan sparsh kiye
 Taking due respect from him, he returned to Mithila Puri with Muniraj
 ahalya ke bare main ek prasiddh shloke he: Sanskrit Shlokaahlya Draupadi Sita Tara Mandodari and
 panchakanyah smarennityam mahapatakanashinyah 
 Shlokarth Ahalya, Draupadi, Sita, Tara and Mandodari should be remembered daily, they are going to destroy the great sins
 note: ek anya rup main is shloke main sita kii jagah kunti likhaa miltaa he
 Traditional Hindus, especially Hindu wives, remember Panchakanya in the morning prayer, they are considered to be the five kumarias
 ek mat ke anusaar ye paanchon "udaahraneey pavitra naariyaan" athwa mahaari nrity parampara anusaar mahasatiyaan hai, or katipay shaktiyon kii swamini bhi hai
 According to this opinion, Ahalya is the most prominent among these five who were fraudulently corrupted while she had total loyalty to her husband
 ahalya ko paanchon main pramukh isliye bhi mana jaataa he kyonki yah paatr kalanukram main bhi sabase pehle hai
 In the Goddess Bhagavata Purana, Ahalya has been ranked as one of the second class goddesses, who are considered auspicious, famous and admirable; Apart from Tara and Mandodari, Arundhati and Damayanti etc
 have also been included in the Panchasati
 anya mat panchakanyaon ko koi adarsh nari ke rup main nahin dekhtaa or inhen anukaraniya bhi nahin maanata
 Bhattacharya, who is the author of panch-kanya: The Five Virgins of Indian Epics, reveals a comparative view between the Panchakanyaas and the Panchasatis, Sati Sita, Savitri, Damayanti and Arundhati, asking: "so what then is Ahalya, Draupadi, Kunti, Tara and Mandodari are not true wives because each of them knew a man besides her husband? " chunki, ve aise kamavyapaar kaa pradarshan karti hai jo paramparaagat aadarshon ke vipareet he, bhartiya samaaj sudhaarak kamaladevi chattopadhyaay is baat par vismay vyakt karti hai ki ahalya or tara ko panchakanyaon main shaamil kiya gaya he
 However, this exorcism of Ahalya made him a partaker of sin and did not get the high position that women like Sita and Savitri had, this act made him immortal in the stories
 vah sthaan jahaan ahalya ne apane shaap kii avadhi purna kii or jahaan shapmukt huin, granthon main ahalya-tirth ke naam se ullekith or pavitra sthaan ke rup mempratishthit he
 a place of pilgrimage is a place or water repository where Hindu pilgrims usually take a bath and believe to be free from their sins
 ahalya-tirth kii vaastavik avasthiti ke bare main vivaad he: kuch granthon ke mutabiq yah godavari nadi ke tat par sthit he jabaki kuch granth ise narmada ke tat par sthit maanate hai
 There are two major places whose claim to be Ahalya pilgrimage is most strongly presented
 pehla, madhya pradesh ke baalod ke paas narmada ke kinare maujuud ahalyeshwar mandir; doosraa bihar ke darbhanga zile main sthit mandir
 The temple named Ahalya Asthan and ahalya-gram are also located in this district which is dedicated to Ahalya
 matsay puraana or kurm puraana main, kaamdev ke saamaan rupavaan banane or naariyon ko aakarshith karne kii kaamana rakhane vaale purushon ko ahalya tirth main jaakar ahalya kii upasna karne kaa maarg sujhaayaa gaya he
 This worship is said to be performed in the month of Kamadeva, Chaitra, and according to the scriptures, the person bathing in this shrine enjoys the pleasures of the apsaras
 bhattacharya ke anusaar, ahalya nari ke us shaswat rup kaa pratinidhitiv karti he jo aapane andar kii abhipsa ko bhi ansuna nahin kar paati or na hi pavitrataa kii ucch bhaawanaaon ko hi jo uski shaareerik kaamanaayon kii purti na kar paane vaale uske sadhu pati main nihit hai or uski nijee ichchhaaon ke saath virodhabhas rakhti hai
 The author sees Ahalya as an independent woman who makes her own decision, risks being subjected to curiosity, and in the end accepts the punishment of her act as a curse that her husband, the representative of the masculine society Is imposed by shaap kii avichlit hokar sweekrut hi vah kaary he jo ramayana ko is paatr kii prashansa karne ko vivash kar detaa he or use prashasneey evam anukaraniya charitra ke rup main sthapit kar detaa he
 Like Bhattacharya, Meena Kelkar, author of the book Subordination of Woman: a New Perspective, realizes that Ahalya is made revered because she embraces the gender-based ideals of the male dominated society; She accepts the curse without any resistance and believes that she should have been punished
 iske alaava kelkar yah bhi jodatii hai ki granthon main ahalya ko mahaan ghoshit kiye jane kaa ek anya kaaran usko mili shaap dwaara striyon ko chetavanee dena or unhen niruddh kiye jane ke liye bhi ho saktaa he
 Some of the similar stories in Hindu myths are also found in Greek myths, where Zeus, the king of the gods, who is similar to Indra in a way, disguises Alakmini's husband by tricking him into contact with him
 The famous Kathapurush Hercules is born
 ahalya kii hi tarah is greek katha ke do varshan hai jinamein se ek ke anusaar alkmini zyoos ke kapat ko pahchaanane ke baavzood uske saath sansarg karti he, jabaki duusare varshan ke anusaar vah nirdosh he or pravanchanaa kii shikaar he
 The major difference in the two narratives is that Zeus' work is justified by the association of the Alcameni with the origin of the progeny such as Herculeus, and that Alchemine also does not appear to have any accusations of being vicious; By treating Ahalya's act as lascivious conduct, she not only proves it bad but also receives punishment in the form of curse
 ahilya kii katha Tamralipta or Tamralipti was an ancient city located in the Bay of Bengal
 vidwaanon kaa mat he ki vartmaan taamluk hi pracheen tamralipti tha
 It is believed that this city was the commercial exit point for the Mauryan Empire in South Asia and south-east Asia
 pashchimi bengal ke midanapur jile kaa aadhunik taamluk athwa tamaluk jo kalakatta se 33 mile dakshin pashchim main rupanarayan nadi ke pashchimi kinare par sthit he
 Although its present distance from the sea is 60 miles, it was touched by the sea in the ancient and medieval ages until the 17th century and was a famous port on the southeastern coast of India
 tamralipti, nagar kii hi nahin, ek vishaal janapad kii bhi sangya thi
 In those days, the river Ganges also flowed through its city and due to its meeting with the sea, the city had great commercial importance
 bharatvarsh ke sambandh main likhanewaala suprasiddh bhugolashastri plini use 'tamlitis' kii sangya detaa he
 The ruins of the ancient Tamralipati town can still be seen in the fertile valley of the river
 tamralipti janapad or uske bandargah kaa mahatv bharatiyon ko purvi bharat or samudr paar dakshin-purv ke deshon kii jaankaree ho jane ke baad badha hoga
 He is first discussed in the Mahabharata, in which it is said that Bhimsen recovered the tax by defeating the king there
 mauryon kaa yug aate aate uskaa mahatv nishchay hi spasht rup se prakat hone laga tha
 Pliny describes a road that ran from Pushkaravati in the northern western border to Takshashila, Hastinapur, modern Anoopshahar and Dibai to Kannoz, Prayag, Varanasi and Pataliputra
 bich main vah sindhu, jhelum, vyas, satluj, yamuna or ganga ko paar karti thi
 Even before Patiliputra she used to go to Gangasagar in the east and the Tamralipti site would have been her last point
 ] main tathaa unani lekhakon ke vivaranon main mauryo ke nauvibhag kaa jo vivaran he, usase sthaliy vyapaar ke saath jaleey vyapaar kaa sahaj anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 From this point of view, the natural condition of Tamralipati would be of great importance because not only did it connect south-eastern India with the cities of the overseas countries, but also the cities of Central Asia
 baad main jyon jyon dakshini-purvi asia ke deshon kii jaankaree hoti gai tathaa unase bharat ke vyapaarik, saanskrithik or raajnneetik sambandh badhate gaye, tamralipti kii pramukhataa bhi badhati gai
 From the fourth century to the 12th century, ships from many countries used to live there
 vahaan se nil, shahatut or pasham kaa niryaat baahar ke deshon ko kiya jaataa tha
 The Buddhist importance of Tamralipati also increased from the time of Ashoka
 sinhal ke buddha granthon-mahavansh or dipavansh main use tamalapti athwa tamralipti kaha gaya he or unase dipavansh main use tamralitti athwa tamralipti kaha gaya he or unase yah soochna milti he ki vahiin se ashok ne jahaaj dwaara bodhivruksh kii shakha sinhal bheji thi
 On that occasion Ashoka himself reached there from Pataliputra crossing the Ganges
 paanchavi shatee ke prarambh main phahyan bhi vahiin se hokar samudramaarg dwaara sinhal gaya tha 
 At the time of Harshavardhana, when Yuvanchwad came to India, he saw Tamralipti
 vahaan usne kuch buddha vihaar or ashok kaa banwaaya hua ek stambh bhi dekha tha 
 Intsang left his ship there while coming to India from China
 baad ke bharat aane vaale chini yatriyon ne bhi vaisaa hi kiya 
 Tamralipati would have been the gateway to traffic from India even when the Indian princes established their colonies in the Malay Peninsula and the archipelago of Indian China
 kintu bhartiya itihaas ke madhyakaal main uskaa vyapaarik mahatv avashya kuch kam ho gaya ore europe se jab vyapaarik jatiyaan bharat main ai pashchimi samudratat hi upyog main laayaa jane laga
 Tamluk maanav ke pachan tantra main ek aahaar-naal or sahyogi granthiyaan hoti hai
 The alimentary canal is made up of the mouth, pharynx, pharynx, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and anus
 sahaayak pachan grathiyon main laar granthi, yakrut, pittashay or agnashay hai
 Special components of dietary substances are protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, mineral salts and water
 sabhi khaadya padaarth inhen ghatakon se bane rahete hai
 One has more components, some less
 hamaara sharir bhi inhen avyavon kaa bana hua he
 2 / 3 of the body is water
 protein sharir kii mukhya vastu he, jisase ang banate hai
 Carbohydrates remain in the body in the form of glucose, which the muscles always need
 vasa kii bhi atyadhik maatra sharir main ekatra rahati he
 Vitamins and salts are required for proper editing of body functions
 hamaara sharir ye sab vastuen aahaar se hi praapt karata he
 Yes, the chemical form of the ingredients from the diet is different from the body form
 atev aahaar ke avyavon ko sharir pachak rason dwaara unke sookshm ghatakon main vighatit kar detaa he or un ghatakon kaa phir se sanshleshan karke apane liye upyukt avyavon ko taiyaar kar letaa he
 This is done by organ cells
 jo ghatak upyogi nahin hote, unako ye chhod detii hai
 The body excretes such substances through feces, urine, sweat and breathing
 pachan kaa prayojan he aahaar ke gudh avyavon ko saadhaaran ghatakon main vibhakt kar dena
 This work is performed by lala rasa in the mouth, gastric juice in the stomach, pancreas juice and bile in the duodenum, and in the asteroid by the intestines
 in kaaryon kaa yahan sankshep main varnan kiya jaataa he : The food in the mouth is chewed by teeth and divided into microscopic particles and saliva gets mixed in it, in which there is an enzyme called tyline
 yah ras munh ke baahar sthit kapolgrathi or adhohanviny tathaa adhojihv grathiyon main banataa hai
 From these glands, especially by chewing their food, saliva juice keeps coming in the mouth
 isaki kriya kshareey hoti he
 The chemical action of its tyline enzyme is particularly on carbohydrates, which causes its starch to be converted first into dextrin and then to glucose
 saadhaaran eekh kii chini main bhi yahi parivartan hota he
 Wetting and snoring of the food grains are also the main function of Lala, so that it can be swallowed easily and the thin grass reaches the stomach through the placenta
 nigalane kii kriya mukh ke bheetar jihva kii peshiyon tathaa grasani kii peshiyon dwaara hoti he
 Due to the inhibition of the muscles of the tongue, the tongue lifts up and presses the grass placed on the palate and the tongue, which slips and goes from the pharynx backwards
 turant grasani kii peshiyaan sankoch karti hai or grass ghatidhakkan par hota hua grasanalee main chalaa jaataa he, jahaan uski bhittiyon main sthit vrittakar or anudairthay sutara apane sankoch or vistaar se utpann hui antragati dwaara usko naal ke ant tak pahunchaa dete hai
 And the grass enters the stomach through the gastritis
 amashay main pachan kii kriya jathraras dwaara hoti he
 The mucous glands of the stomach produce this juice
 jab aahaar amashay main pahunchataa he to yah ras chaaron ore kii grathiyon se amashay main aisi teevr gati se pravaahit hone lagata he jaise usko undela ja rahaa ho
 The two main components of this juice are enzymes called pepsin and hydrochloric acid
 pepsin kii vishesh kriya proteinon par hoti he, jisamen hydrochloric amla sahaayta karata he
 By this action, the protein first swells and then starts melting from outside
 is kaaran grass kaa bheetar kaa bhaag der se galata he
 This leads to the action of Lala's tiline enzyme until all the alkali of Lala is neutralized by the acidic acid of the stomach
 jathreey ras kii kriya dwaara protein se pehle metaprotein banataa he
 It then turns into a protozoase
 proteojez phir peptone main tut jate hai
 It does not change much
 jathreey ras main do or enzim bhi hote hai, jinako amiles or lypez kehete hai
 Amylase dissolves carbohydrates and lipase fats
 is main doodh ko faadanevaala ek or enzim renin bhi hota he
 It also has mild bactericidal power
 jathreey ras kaa srav mukhyatya tantrikamandal ke adheen he
 Experiments by the noted Russian scholar Pavloff of physiology have thrown much light in this regard
 unase pramanit ho chukaa he ki aahaar padaarthon kii sungadh naak se soonghane or unako netron se dekhne se ras kaa srav hone lagata he
 This is the reason that hunger begins to be known only by the smell of the making of good food items, and seeing them increases the apps
 jeebh par lagane se turant khaane kii ichha hoti he
 If the food items are not good or tasteful, then hunger dies
 aise aahaar kaa pachan bhi uttam reeti se nahin hota
 It also reduces the secretion of juice
 jathreey ras kii kriya visheshkar protein par hoti he
 The secretion of juice occurs when meat, eggs, fish, milk, etc
 reach the stomach
 namak, baraf yaa kankad aadi khaane ko die jaayen to srav nahin hoga
 These two big glands are very much related to digestion of pancreas and liver
 agnyashay main agnyashay ras banataa he
 It is a very strong digestive juice, which acts on all three components: protein, carbohydrate and fat
 iskaa nirmaan agnyashay granthi kii koshikaon dwaara hota he or saare agnyashay se ekatra hokar yah ras ek vahini dwaara grahani main pahunchataa he
 The duct that carries bile from the father's body becomes common bile duct with this pancreas
 usee ke mukh dwaara agnyashay or pitt, donon ras, grahani main pahonchte rahete hai
 The pancreatic gland is located behind the stomach in the left side of the stomach
 iskaa bada sir grahani ke mode main rahata he or uski punch bain ore pleeha tak chali gai he
 Its color is slightly beige brown
 iske sookshm bhaag shahatut ke daanon ke samaan uthe hue dikhaai padate hai
 Pancreas juice has strong action, especially on protein
 usase protein bina foole hue hi ghulne lagata he
 The action of this juice is alkaline
 is kaaran pehle kshareey metaprotein banati he
 Proteases are then formed from metaproteins
 proteos phir peptone main parivartit ho jate hai
 Finally, the breakdown of peptone creates amino acids, which are the end products of protein digestion
 amashay se proteinon ke pachan ke falswaroop jo peptone aate hai, ve bhi amino amlon main tut jate hai
 The nervous system has no control over the secretion of pancreas juice
 tantrikaon ke uttejan se ras kii utpatti kam yaa adhik nahin hoti
 The origin of the juice starts when the food digested in the stomach, which is of semi-fluid form, comes out of the stomach through the pyloric cavity and enters the duodenum
 is amlik kaainm ke sampark se grahani ko shleshmal str kii koshikaon main sicrratin naamak rasinic vastu utpann hoti he
 This item reaches the cells of the pancreas by blood and stimulates them to make juice and then the juice starts coming into the duodenum
 is ras kii duusari visheshta yah he ki yadi grahani main pahunchne se purv hi agnyashay kii nalika main is ras ko ekatra kar liya jaay, to vah niskriy rahata he
 There is no action on its protein
 jab vah grahani main aane par antric ras ke saath mil jaataa he, tabhi usamen protein vighatit karne kii prabal shakti utpann hoti he
 It is believed that an enzyme called enterokinase of intestinal juice activates it
 ye nimnlikhit hai : The upper part of the right side of the abdomen is the largest gland in the body called the liver, which produces bile
 vahaan se pitt pittashay main jaakar ekatra ho jaataa he or pachan ke samay ek vahini dwaara grahani main pahunchataa rahata he
 Can also reach the duodenum directly from the liver
 yah hare rang kaa gadha taral dravya hota he
 It helps in digestion of fat
 grahani se aahaar, jisamen uske paachit avyav hote hai, kshudantra ke pratham bhaag agrakshudrant main aa jaataa he
 At this time it is thick like honey and can flow well into the esophagus
 yahan bhi pachan kriya hoti rahati he
 Pancreatic digestion continues for some time
 kshudantra ke ras main bhi pachan shakti hoti he
 It can break down proteins, but not proteins, and peptones into amino acids
 par uski vishesh kriya depsin amoiles or lipej enzymon ko sakriy bananaa he
 Pavloff, who was the first to explore the subject, believes that all three enzymes remain in their former form before the intestinal juices were found, and are therefore inactive
 tripsin tripsinogen ke rup main rahati he
 Amylase and Lipez also live in the former state
 jab antraras agnyashayras main miltaa he, to tripsinogen se tripsin ban jaati he or shesh donon enzim bhi sakriy ho jate hai
 Pancreas juice is inactive before intestinal juice is added
 kshudantra kaa kaary visheshtya avasorana kaa he
 By looking at the picture of its internal composition, it will be known that in the mucous art inside it, which covers all the bowel from within, deep folds remain, which makes the art surface more than the bowel
 kala kii silavaton par ankur lage rahete hai
 All of these work to be absorbed
 ankuron kii sookshm rachana bhi dhyaan dene yogya he
 In the middle of each shoot, a whitetail has moved near its crest
 yah akshirvahini he
 Black lines appear on either side of it, which are the branches and cells of arteries and veins
 ye donon prakaar kii rachanaayen, vahiniyaan or dhamni tathaa shirayen, baahar yaa neeche jaakar adhoshleshmik str main badi raktavahikaaon or vahiniyon main mil jaati hai
 The fat is absorbed by the mucosa and then reaches the aneurysm and finally gets into the blood
 glucose or protein kaa avasorana hokar ve raktakeshikaon dwaara rakt main pahunch jate hai
 Blood carries these three components to the cells of each organ of the body and nourishes them
 20-22 foot lambii kshudantra kii nalee kaa yahi vishesh kaary he
 The function of the colon is absorption only
 yah ang visheshtya jal kaa avasorana karata he
 At the time of excretion, the form of excreta, which forms in the excreta, forms at the end of the colon and rectum
 24 ghante main brihadantra jal kaa avasorana kar letaa he
 Apart from water, it also absorbs some glucose, but does not absorb any other substance
 iske atirikt loh, magnesium, calosium aadi sharir kaa tyaag brihadantra hi main karte hai
 Here they are excreted and mixed in feces
 jeevanuon kii kriya se bhi pachan main sahaayta milti he
 In the gastrointestinal tract, they break down protein, fat and starch etc
 brihadantra main ve celulose kaa bhi, jisapar kisi pachak ras kii kriya nahin hoti, bhanjan kar daalate hai
 Due to this, gases like hydrogen sulfide, methane etc
 are produced and fat is formed from the breakdown of fat, due to which the action of feces becomes acidic
 yah gati saare pachak naal main, grasanal se lekar malashay tak, hoti rahati he, jisase khaaya hua yaa paachit aahaar nirantar agrasar hota jaataa he
 This motion occurs in other means and also in vessels
 antranal main shleshmal str ke baahar vrittakar or unke baahar anudairdhya peshisutron ke str sthit hai
 The width of the placenta is narrowed by the inhibition of circular formulas
 atev sankoch se aage ke aahaar kaa bhaag peeche ko nahin laut saktaa
 That is why longitudinal formulas shrink and reduce the length of that part of the placenta
 atev aahaar aage ko bad jaataa he
 Then he moves further with similar action in the front section
 yahi antragati kehalaati he
 The second Khandibhavan motion also occurs in the placenta wall
 ye gatiyaan aahaar ko aage badhaane main sahaayta dene ke atirikt, bhalee prakaar se kim ko math sa detii hai, jisase pachak ras or aahaar ke kanon kaa ghanishtha sampark ho jaataa he
 From the description of the action of different digestive juices, it is clear that nature has made such a arrangement that all the components of the dietary substances, which are present in the animal body also, do not go in vain
 unka jitna bhi adhik se adhik ho sake, sharir main upyog ho
 They can create broken parts of the body, also create new tissues and generate energy to work
 aahaar kaa yahi prayojan he or aahaar ke bhinn avyavon kaa unke atyant sookshm tatwon main vibhanjan kar dena, jisase unka avasorana ho jaay or sharir kii koshikaaye unase apni aavashyak vastuen taiyaar kar len, yahi pachan kaa prayojan he
 In fact, in what is commonly called digestion, the sense of two actions is hidden, digestion and absorption
 pachan keval aahaar ke avyavon kaa apane ghatakon main tut janaa he, jo pachak rason kii kriya kaa fal hota he
 Their absorption and reaching into the blood is the second activity, which is the special function of the acinar of the esophagus
 aahaar kaa jo kuch bhaag pachne tathaa avasorana ke pashchaat antra main batch jaataa he vahi mel hota he
 Therefore, there is also some indigestible part of the food in the stool and there are pieces of mucous art of the bowel
 inke atirikt jeevanuon kii bahut badi sankhya hoti he
 It has been calculated that each time 15,00,00,00,000 bacteria are released from the body in the feces
 ye brihadantra se hi aate hai
 He is the home of bacteria
 is kaaran mel main nitrogen kii bahut maatra hoti he, jisase uski uttam khaad banati he
 There is a reflex action of excretion, which is edited by the Atmag Department of the tantric mandala
 jab malashay main mel ekatra ho jaataa he to niyat samay par malashay kii bhittiyon se merujju ke pashchimshwangon kii koshikaon main samveg jate hai, jahaan se ve purvashrangon kii koshikaon main bhej die jate hai
 From there, the new impulses reach the rectum by stimulating tantric sutras, expand the muscular muscles there and increase the intestinal neoplasms of the rectum
 isi samay hamako malatyag kii ichha hoti he or hamaare baithne par tathaa sanvarani peshiyon ke dhili ho jane par malatyag ho jaataa he
 Increasing the pressure inside the abdomen on the inhibition of the above muscles also helps a lot in bowel movement

 Yann 10:21, 2 July 2005 There’s someone proposing a policy to close some minor, slow-growing, “hopeless” wikipedias on the wikimedia meta-wiki
 This proposal is the enemy to the openness of the whole wikipedia community
 i come here to inform you to express your opinion there
 i think it's OK to use your own language on the talk page
 Thank you
 --theodoranian01:24, 28 july 2005 Dear Wikipedians, i need your help to look at date formats for your language
 i created a large list of formats here
 Please take a look and fix any mistakes or add any new formats
 This will help interwiki bot to match en:april 1, fr:1 avril, ru:1 апреля, zh:4月1日, and all other sites together
 What's needed: Look here at every format for your language, fix any mistakes, note any exceptions' unlike all other years)
 Also, i would like to receive a bot status on your site for my bot user:yurikbot
 It will be mostly involved in interwikies
 Thank you !!! You can contact me at en:yurik ) Hi
 i would like to get my interwiki bot yurikbot marked as a bot in your language
 The bot is already operating in almost 50 languages, and it would lower the server load and improve the quality of articles if all interwikies are updated at the same time
 You can read more or ask questions here
 i always run the latest version of the Pywikipediabot
 The request for the bot status is here
 Please support
 Thank you
 --yurik 03:11, 24 December 2005 There is a lot of vandlism here and this wikipedia needs a lot of activity
 i found there is no afd, the common
css is empty, the guidelines are very few
 Where do we discuss all the changes needed here? The mailing list has no activity since months
 The article vikipedia:nayaa panna kaise armbh karen redirects to meri nayi sadsyta, which is nothing but spam
 This has to be deleted, but i don't know where to list this request, as there is no afd

4 16:26, 16 farvari 2006 We have a discussion about the transcription of Taj Mahal to hebrew at he wikipedia, and we could benefit from a recorded example of the name
 if anyone could upload an example to commons, we would be grateful
 Thanks in advance, Felagund, he wiki ambassador
 "stub" or "sabstub" angrezi boli he
 i think that using such English alphas makes it a little difficult to understand the article
 ham inke liye zarur koi hindi shabd izaad kar sakate hai! If i offer my opinion, we can use "seed" instead of "stub" and "seed" instead of "substub"
 yelekh kii haalat ko saafe-shafaaf bayan karte hai, or viki-kalpana ko bhi pesh karte hai
 We did something similar on Nynorsk Wikipedia
 ye bas meraa khyaal tha - agar aap ko pasand na aae to koi baat nahin
 - Arvind 15:21, 9 June 2006 mere khyaal se mudda yah rahaa he ki "stub" yaa "sabstub" jaise shabd hindi prayoktaaon ke liye myne nahin rakhte
 But having ornate words like "sprout" or "plant" will also not be of much benefit because these words of new users or readers will be as unknown as the stub
 behatar ho yadi sidhaa arth samajhane vaale shabd liye jaayen, jaise sabstub ke liye "aparipakv" or stub ke liye "praarambhik" yaa "aarambhik" yaa "aadhaar"
 If you write "this is a base article" or "this is an immature article" then the meaning will be more clear
 debashish kii batoo kaa samarthan karata hoon
 Words should be simple
 "aparipakv" shabd se lag saktaa he jo stub nahi he ve paripakv he or yogadan na bhi mili to thik he
 So the term "base article" would be more appropriate
 agar shabd se aisa lage ki lekh ko badhaana chahie to or bhi zyada upyukt hoga
