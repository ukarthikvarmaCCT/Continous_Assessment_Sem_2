 Thousands of tons of heavy ships are lifted into a lock to lift 85 feet to pass through this canal, built between the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean
 puure lock tantra ko paar karne ke liye pehle jahaaj ko sabase nichle lock main laayaa jaataa he, phir lock ko band kar usamen shaktishaalee pampon dwaara pani bharaa jaataa he
 In this way, the ship starts to rise from the water
 tatpashchaat baari or behad taqatvar locomotive ingine jahaaj ko parshvon se takaraane se bachaate hue khinchate hai or duusare lock main le jate hai
 Then the same thing is repeated in the second lock, filling the water, pulling the ship and moving

 Due to the color constraint hypothesis, a hadron cannot hold a nigh color charge; That is, the total color charge of any particle must be zero
 ek quark teen tarah ke color aavesh rakh saktaa he: "laal", "haraa" or "nila"
 Only white characters are possible for a common hadron which can be obtained by the following three methods: berion sankhya bahut purv hi paribhaashit kii ja chuki thi or quark model se pehle hi sthapit kiya ja chukaa tha, atah paribhaasha badalane ke bajaay kan bhautik vigyaaneeyon ne saamaanya rup se sabhi quarkon ko ek tihaai berion sankhya aavantit kii gai
 Quarkless particles means that the baryon number of particles that do not form quarks is zero
 is tarah ke kan lepton or gej boson ; yaa pariklpit kan gravitone hai
 The baryon number is preserved in almost all actions of the standard model

 Fredrik William August Frobel was a famous German scholar
 ve pastalogy ke shishy the
 He conceptualized kindergarten
 unhone shaikshanik khilaunon kaa vikaas kiya jinhen 'frobel uphaar' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Froebel has an important place in the education world
 balak ko paudhe se tulana karke, frobel ne balak ke swavikas kii baat kahi vah pehla vyakti tha, jisane praathmik skulon ke amanviya vyavhaar ke viruddh aawaaj uthaai or ek nai shikshan vidhi kaa pratipaadan kiya
 He ended the monotony of schools through self-determination, socialism and sports
 sansar main frobel hi pehla vyakti tha jisane alpaayu baalkon kii shiksha ke liye ek vyavhaarik yojana prastut kiya
 He asked the teachers not to interfere in the development of the inner powers of the child, instead giving full freedom to the children by behaving lovingly and sympathetically
 shiksha ke kshetra main is prakaar kaa parivartan laane ke liye frobel ko hameshaa yaad kiya jaayegaa
 Frobel was born in a small village called Oberweis Baek, Germany
 bachapan main hi uski maan kaa dehant ho gaya tathaa uske pita ne duusari shaadi kar lee or frobel ke paalan-poshan main koi ruchi nahin lee
 When Frobel did not get any love from his father and Vimata, he started walking in the woods sadly
 isse uske hriday main prakruti ke prati anuraag utpann ho gaya
 When Frobel was 10 years old, his maternal uncle saw his pathetic condition and sent him to school, but he did not mind his studies
 15 varsh kii aayu main uske mamaa ne use jivicoparjan hetu ek ban rakshak ke yahan bhej diya, vahaan bhi uskaa man nahin laga
 But here Frobel did a good study of nature and came to the conclusion that there is unity in the laws of nature
 18 varsh kii aayu main frobel ko jaina vishvavidhyalay bheja gaya, kintu dhanabhav ke kaaran use vah vishvavidhyalay bhi chhodana padaa
 He then worked at a school run by Gruner in Frankfort
 apane anubhavon se frobel is nishkarsh par pahunchaa ki baalkon ko rachanaatmak evam kiyatmak abhivyakti kaa avasar diya janaa chahie
 In 1808, he went to the school 'vardan', founded by Pastelaji, where he worked as a teacher
 san 1816 main frobel ne kilhau main ek skool kholaa, lekin aarthik kathinaaiyon kekaaran use band kar dena padaa
 In 1826, Froebel published his famous book 'education of Man', and to implement his ideas, he opened a school in the Blacken class called 'kinder Garten' which he built a child garden and education to children by using toys and equipment etc
 Started providing
 is skool ko aashcharya janak safalataa mili, falswaroop vibhinn sthanon par kinder garton skool khul gayi
 In 1851, the government closed all Kinder Garten schools, considering Frobel as revolutionary
 isse frobel ko itnaa ksht hua ki san 1853 main uskaa swargvaas ho gaya
 The first teaching method for teaching young children was first introduced by Froebel
 frobel kaa maananaa tha ki baalkon ke andar vibhinn sadgun hote hai
 We should develop those virtues so that he can become a character and participate successfully in the work of the nation
 frobel kaa vishwaas tha ki jaise ek beej main sampoorn vriksh chipa rahata he, usee prakaar prayek balak main ek purna vyakti chipa rahata he arthath balak main apane purv vikaas kii sambhaavnaayen nihit hoti hai
 Therefore, it is the responsibility of education to provide such a natural environment to the child, so that the child can fully develop his internal powers
 frobel kaa kahana he ki jis prakaar upyukt vaataavaran milane par ek beej badhkar ped ban jaataa he, usee prakaar upyukt vaataavaran milane par balak bhi purna vyakti ban jaataa he
 Frobel has described the child as a plant, the school as a garden and the teacher as a gardener, saying that the school is a garden in which the child-like plant grows naturally according to its internal rules under the supervision of teacher Hwpi Mali
 mali kii bhaati shikshak kaa kaary anukool vaataavaran prastut karnaa he, jisase balak kaa swaabhaavik vikaas ho sake
 Frobel's view is that despite all the things in the world, there is unity, even though there is diversity
 ye sabhi vasteen apane aantarik niyamon ke anusaar viksit hoti hui us ekta kii ore ja rahi he
 Therefore, education should enable a person to see unity in this diversity
 frobel kaa yah bhi vichaar he ki balak kii shiksha main kisi prakaar kaa hastkshep na karke uske swaabhaavik vikaas hetu purna avasar dena chahie, taaki apane aapako, prakruti ko tathaa ishwariya shakti ko pahchaan sake
 In short, according to Froebel the following objectives of education should be- frobel ne paathyakram nirmaan ke kuch siddhanth bataaye hai, jaise- Keeping in mind the above principles, Frobel prominently put subjects like nature studies, religious instruction, hand business, mathematics, language, and arts in the curriculum
 usne is baat par bal diya ki paathyakram ke sabhi vishyon main ekta kaa sambandh avashya hona chahie
 Because if there is no relation of unity in the subjects of the syllabus, then the objective of education cannot be achieved
 frobel ne apni shikshan-vidhi ko nimnlikhit siddhanton par aadhaarit kiya he- Frobel wanted the child to develop his personality, so he stressed the principle of self-action
 aatm kriya se frobel kaa taatpary us kriya se tha, jise balak apane aap tathaa apni hvachi ke ankul swatantra vaataavaran main karke sikhta he
 Froebel states that the child overcomes self-aggression and adapts the environment
 isliye balak kii shiksha aatm kriya dwaara arthath usko karke seekhney dena chahie
 Froebel was the first pedagogist to talk about sports
 iskaa kaaran usne yah bataaya ki balak khel main adhik ruchi letaa he
 According to Froebel the child's self-action develops through play
 isliye balak ko khel dwaara sikhaaya janaa chahie, taaki balak ke vyaktitv kaa vikaas swaabhaavik rup se ho sake
 According to Froebel, the child develops independently by working independently and his development is hindered by interference or obstruction
 isliye usne is baat par bal diya ki shikshak ko balak ke seekhney main kisi prakaar kaa hastkshep nahin karnaa chahie, balki vah keval ek sakriy nireekshak ke rup main kaary kare
 The person is a social animal
 samaaj se alag vyakti kaa koi astitv nahin he
 That is why Froebel emphasized on collective sports and collective work, so that the social qualities like mutual love, sympathy, collective cooperation, etc
 can be easily achieved in children
 frobel ne damanaatmak anushaasan kaa virodh kiya or kaha ki aatmanushasan yaa swanushasan hi sabase acha anushaasan hota he
 Therefore, children should have complete freedom to perform self-action, so that the child gets used to discipline himself
 frobel ke anusaar balak ke saath prem evam sahanubhutipurna vyavhaar karnaa chahie tathaa use aatmakriya karne kaa purna avasar pradaan karnaa chahie
 According to Froebel the teacher should be a director, friend and guide
 usne shikshak kii tulana us mali se kii he, jo udyaan ke paudhon ke vikaas main madad karata he
 The way a child develops under the direction of a teacher
 frobel kaa vichaar he ki shikshak ko balak ke kaaryon main kisi prakaar kaa hastkshep nahin karnaa chahie, balki uskaa kaary sirf balak ke kaaryon kaa nirikshan karnaa he or uske vikaas hetu upyukt vaataavaran pradaan karnaa he

 yah katha plato ke mitra sucraat or plato ko bhai gloucon ke bich hui baatcheet ke rup main likhi gai he
 In this story, Socrates says that imagine some people who have been tied to a wall of a dark cave with chains for a lifetime
 unke peeche ek aag jal rahi he or ve keval apane saamne vaali diwaar par aag kii raushnee dekh sakate hai
 Now understand that in front of that fire some things come out, whose shadows fall on that wall
 un bandiyon ke liye keval yah parchhaaiyaan hi asaliyat hai or ve inhen hi vishwa kii sachai maanakaar jite hai
 Plato said that in reality the world is similar to humans and philosophers are those who are able to see the truth behind the shadows, free from the captivity of that cave
 sucraat ne ek aisi sthiti kaa varnan kiya jisamen logon dwaara sachhee asaliyat samajhen jane vaale tathy vastav main keval bhram hai
 He asked Glaucon to imagine a cave in which some captives have been incarcerated since childhood, and their entire body and head are clutched with a wall of the cave so that they can only see the front wall without moving their head
 unke peeche ek bahut badi aag jal rahi he jiske aage ek chalane kii jagah he
 On this, some other people walk in front of the fire with objects of different shapes on their ends
 bandi in chizon ke saae dekhte hai or uske alaava jivan bhar kuch nahin dekhte
 They find these shadows to be real things
 gupha main logon ke chalane se goonjati hui awaz bhi unhen in parchaiyon kii sachhee dhvaniyaan lagati hai
 The same person is sensible and admirable for those prisoners who can tell which will be the next coming shadow
 ab sucraat ne kaha ki kalpana karo kii kisi aise bandi kii bediyaan kholkar use ghumkar asli vastuen dekhne diya jaae
 This man will not recognize those things and still believe that shadows are reality and more real than these things
 sucraat ne kaha, "ab aage yah soch ki us aadmi ko aag dekhne ke liye vivash kiya jaae: kya vah chaundhiya kar waapas apane parichit saayon kii taraf nahin munh mode legaa? agar use koi ghasitkar gupha se baahar le jaae to kya use ghaseetne vaale par krodh nahin aayega? agar use baahar suraj ke prakaash main le jaaya jaae to kya vah uttejit hokar parchaiyon ko satya or in nae drishyon asaty nahin tehraayega?" lekin kuch der baad vah mukt hone kaa aadi ho jayega or dekhegaa kii suraj se parchhaaiyaan padati hai or dhire-dhire samajhane lagegaa ki vah or uske saathi hameshaa se parchhaaiyaan dekhte aaye hai jo raushnee dwaara vastav kii chizon se padatin hai
 Socrates now asked Glaucon to think about this free man's mood
 "jab vah apane puraane ghar or us samaaj main budhimaani kii paribhaasha ke bare main sochega ko kya vah swayan ko sukhi or unki sthiti ko dayaneey nahin samajhegaa? or us samaaj dwaara aane vaali parchaiyon kii bhavishyavaanee karne ke liye die jane vaale inaamon, aadar or prashansa ko kya vah bekaar nahin samajhegaa? or agar vah waapas vahaan jaae to andheron kii aadat na hone se kya vah us samaaj kii nazaron main tuchh nahin ho jayega? kya vah yah nahin kahenge ki dekho, yah upar gaya or apni drushti ganvaa ke lautaa, isliye upar jane kii koshish karnaa bhi vyarth he? agar vah kisi aise aadmi ko kisi tarah pakad len jo unhen mukt karke upar le jane kii cheshtaa kar rahaa ho, to use maar na daalenge?" apane peeche kii duniya se anjaan yah qaidi mukt vyakti kii drushti ko bhrasht paayenge or us har baat se darenge jise vah pehle se nahin jaanate
 He would find this free man foolish and incompetent as he would not be able to see the shadows properly after returning to the dark for some time
 kisi bhi sthiti main jab koi shishy ek shrenee kaa gyaan rakhata he or use guru ko us se ucch shrenee kaa gyaan dena hota he, to kabhi-kabhi us shishy kaa puraa drushtikon badalanaa hota he
 From a higher-order point of view, he begins to see his earlier feeling in a new light and reaches a deeper reality
 lekin in gyaan ke alag staron se shishy or guru main samajhane-samajhane kii kathinaaiyaan paidaa ho sakati hai
 Often, one is nervous about reaching a higher level of knowledge than the present, is unable to recognize new knowledge and reaching that level is a difficult experience for him personally

 Five years later, due to his health he returned to Dorset and decided to dedicate himself to writing

 Though he later separated from his wife, his death in 1912 caused him a deep shock

 phir bhi vah apni pehali patni kii maut se ubhar nahin paae or kavy-lekhan se apane dukh ko bhulane kii koshish karte rahe
 In December 1927, Hardy succumbed to pleurisy and passed away after writing his final poem to his wife at 9 pm on 11 January 1928; The cause of death was cited in the death certificate, "heartburn", "old age" was cited as a contributing factor

 From 1870 to 1898 he enriched the narrative
 ve jivan or sansar ke parichaalan main koi nyaay athwa vyavastha na dekhte the unke anusaar ek andhi shakti is jagat ke kaaryakalapon kaa parichaalan karti thi
 He used to call this blind power 'willful' - the demeanor that lies in life and the world
 apane kathasahitya main hardi ne jagat ke vyapaaron par apana akraman uttarottar adhik tikhaa kiya
 In earlier novels it is relatively mild
 1879 main unki pehali uplabdh rachana prakashit hui, 'desparat remedies', 1872 main duusari, 'under di greenwood tree' or 1873 main teesri 'e peyar ov blue ij'
 The next work 'far from the Madding Crowd' is a more mature work and gained fame after its publication
 aatmavishvaas praapt kar hardi ne vishwa kii gati par apana aghat adhik teevr kar diya
 The best works of this period are - 'the Woodlanders', 'the Return of the Native', 'the Trumpet Major' and 'the Mayor of Wasterbridge'
 iske baad do upanyaas or likhe gaye jinamein hardi ghor niraashaa main dub gaye hai
 Fearing the critics, Hardy quit writing novels and began writing poetry
 bees varsh tak unhone kavita likhi or apane liye khyaati ke nae dwaar khole
 Hardy continued to express his views in poetry as well, but the trauma expressed in the poems did not maim readers and critics to that extent
 hardi kaa kahana tha ki 'yadi galileo ne kavita main likhaa hota ki prithvi gumti he, to shaayad unhen itani takalif na sahani padati
 Hardy turned to the first love of his literary life by adopting poetry once again
 isi bich inhone apni sabase mahatvapurn kriti 'di dyenasts' likhi
 It was published in three parts
 yah rachana naatak ke rup main mahakavy he
 It cannot be played at physical theater

 The story relates to Napoleon's expedition

 The power of life keeps rotating the cycle and all the virtuous and vicious people keep grinding in it

 Hardy's family believed in the Anglican Church but were not staunch followers
 paanch saptaah kii umr main unka baptism hua or vah carch ko jaaya karte the, jahaan unke pita or chachaa sangeet ke liye yogadan dete the
 Still he did not attend the school of the local Church of England, he was sent to Mr

 Hardy considered converting but decided not to convert again
 basto australia chalaa gaya, lambey arase tak unke bich patrachaar chalata rahaa lekin antat hardi is aadan-pradaan se thak gaye or patrachaar band ho gaya
 With this, Hardy's relationship with Baptist ended
 jivan main bhagya ke bare main hardi kaa vichaar parameshwar ke saath darshanik sangharsh main parilakshith hua
 Although Hardy's faith remained intact, he questioned the traditional Christian view of God because of the irony and struggles of life: hardi ke dharmik jivan main agyeyavaad, aastikta or aadhyatmavaad kaa mila-jula rup dekhne ko miltaa he
 Once, when a pastor asked the letter to reconcile the torture of suffering with the righteousness of the loving God, Hardy replied, phir bhi, hardi aksar brahmad ko niyantrit karne vaali alokik shaktiyon ke bare main sochaa karte the or likhaa karte the, vah aisa kisi drudh vishwaas kii bajaae nirpeksh bhav main or mouj main aakar karte the
 In addition, Hardy's writings also reveal to some extent his attraction to ghosts and spirits
 in bhaawanaaon ke baavjood, hardi isai upasna or carch kii rasmon se bhaavnaatmak rup se jude rahe, visheshkar jo gramin samudaayon main prachlit hai, jivan ke praarambhik varshon main un par inkaa bahut nirmaanatmak prabhaav padaa or hardi ke anek upanyaason main bible sandarbhon kii bharmaar dekhi ja sakati he
 Hardy's friends included Horace Moll and poet William Barnes, both pastors, during John Hicks' apprenticeship here
 mal zindagi bhar hardi ke kareebi dost rahe or bible kii shabdic vyakhya par andeh uthaane vaali nai vaigyanik khojon se jaise ki gidon mentel kii, unka parichay karavaaya

 It has also been suggested that the character of Henry Knight in a Pair of Blue Eyes was based on Horace Moll
 1867 main purna kiya gaya hardi kaa pehla upanyaas, da pier main and da ladi ko prakashit karne ke liye koi prakaashak raji nahin hua or hardi ne pandulipi nasht kar di, isliye upanyaas ke kuch hisse hi uplabdh hai
 His mentor and friend, Victorian novelist and poet George Meredith, encouraged him to try again
 desparit remedies or under da greenwood tree agyaat rup se prakashit kiye gaye the
 In 1873 Hardy's novel a Pair of Blue Eyes, based on his love for his first wife, was published under his own name
 "clifahanger" shabd kaa udbhav is kahani ke dharawahik roopaantar se mana jaataa he jisamen ek nayak henri nite ko vastav main chattan se latakta hua chhod diya jaataa he
 Hardy said that he first introduced Wessex in his next novel, From the Madding Crowd
 yah itnaa safal rahaa ki hardi ne vaastushilp kaa kaam chhodkar sahitya ko apni jivan-vritti ke rup main apana liya
 Over the next twenty-five years, Hardy wrote more than ten novels

 Its subtitle, a Pure Woman: Faithfully Presented, was intended to point fingers at the middle class of the Victoria era
 1895 main prakashit jud da obscyor main yon ke mukt vivechan kii victorian janata ne ore bhi ninda kii or ise praayah "jud da obsin" kahkar pukaara jaataa tha
 Highly condemned for hurting the institution of marriage by presenting concepts like orgasm, the book put further negative pressure on Hardy's previously disastrous marital life as Emma Hardy worried that Jude the Obscure was read as an autobiography Will go
 Some booksellers sold the novel in brown envelopes and it is said that the Bishop of Wakefield burned his copy
 1912 ke apane upsanhaar main, hardi ne is ghatana kaa hawala mazaaq ke taur par pustak ke karier kaa bhaag kahkar diya: "press ke in faisalon ke baad iskaa aglaa durbhaagya ek bishap dwaara jalaayaa janaa tha - shaayad mujhe na jala paane kii hataasha main"
 Despite this criticism, by the early 1900s, Hardy had made his place in English literature by writing several highly successful novels, but public reaction to his two great works aroused disinterest and left him writing the novel altogether
 hardi dwaara likhit anya upanyaason main shaamil he khagol vigyaan ke jagat par aadhaarit ek prem kahani tu on e tower Although he wrote a lot of poems but remained mostly unpublished until 1898, Hardy is best remembered for his series of novels and short stories written between 1871 and 1895
 unke upanyaas vesex, dakshin or dakshin pashchim england kaa vishaal kshetra jiskaa naam us kshetra ke anglo-sackson rajya ke naam par padaa, ke kaalpanik jagat kii prishthbhumi main rachit hai
 Hardy was part of two worlds
 apane bachapan ke gramin jivan se bhi unka gaharaa bhaavnaatmak lagaav tha par saath hi vah ho rahe parivartanon or prachlit saamaajik samasyaon, krishi kshetra main nawacharon se - audyogic kranti ke kaaran angreji dehaat main hue parivartanon se zaraa pehle ke yug kii nabz pakadaney se lekar - victorian samaaj ke yon vyavhaar ke anauchity or paakhand ke prati vah jaagruk the Hardy was a critic of social bonds that hampered the lives of people living in the 19th century
 victoria kaal ke yathartwaadee lekhak maane jane vaale hardi ne saamaajik bandhanon ko parkhaa jo victorian yathasthiti kaa hissaa hai or mana ki ye bandhan sabhi shaamil logon ke jivan main baadha daalate hai or aakhirkaar dukh kaa kaaran banate hai
 In Two on a Tower, Hardy is seen voicing these rules and creating a story against the backdrop of social structure, a tale of love that transcends class boundaries
 pathak prem ke liye sthapit paramparaon ko todane kaa vichaar karne par majaboor ho jaataa he
 These traditions are applicable in nineteenth-century society and social pressure ensures their compliance

 Far from the Madding Crowd tells a story of life created by coincidence

" samay kaa chakra chal padaa he to puraa hokar hi rahegaa

 Hardy portrays a lively depiction of 19th century rural life, a world full of superstitions and injustice, with all its joys and sorrows
 unke nayak or nayikaayen aksar samaaj se kate hue hote hai or unhen shaayad hi kabhi dobaaraa apanaaya jaataa he
 He represents mainly middle class people in his novels and emphasizes the emotional and negative forces of fate
 apni pustakon main hardi moulik junun, gahari bhaavana or agyeya parivartan kaa shikaar ghaatak evam galat avadharana vaale kanoonon ke khilaaf sangharsh karti maanviya ichha ko darshaate hai
 For example, Tess of the Deurberville ends: vishesh rup se, hardi kaa upanyaas jud da obscyor antim victoria kaal ke sankat kii bhaavana se ot-prot he 
 It describes the tragedy of two new social types, Jude Foley, the working man who strives to be self-educated, and his girlfriend and cousin Sue Brideshead who represents the 'new woman' of the 1890s

 Even the smallest thing does not miss his eyesight, he is also able to portray the vast landscape of his Wessex in sad or gentle pleasure
 
 In 1898 Hardy published his first poetry collection of poems, Wessex Poems, written over a period of more than 30 years
 hardi kaa daawa tha ki kavita unka pehla pyaar he or 1928 main apni mrityu tak vah sangrah prakashit karte rahe

 In a recent biography of Hardy, Claire Tomlin argues that Hardy became a truly great English poet after the death of his first wife Emma, beginning with mourning songs in his memory, he wrote these poems Is described as "the finest and astonishing ritual of the dead in English poetry"
 unki adhikansh kavitaayen jaise "neutral tones" jivan or prem main niraashaa tathaa maanviya pidaa ke prati nirpekshata ke viruddh lambey samay se chale aa rahe maanavtaa ke sangharsh ke vishay main hai
 Some poems like "the Darkling Thrush" and "an August Midnight" are about poetic writing because the nature described in them inspires Hardy to write them
 aksar saadhaaran dikhte vishyon main pashchaatap kii hook sunai detii he
 His compositions range from a three-volume epic audiovisual The Dinestas to a variety of comedic poetry inspired by the makers of small and often optimistic or joyful ballads such as the almost unknown "the Children and Sir Nemales", Martins' Tombs, Athlhampton 
 vesex poems main vishesh rup se pramukh vishaywastu unnisvin sadi par nepolian ke yudhon kii lambii chaaya he udaahranarth, "da sargent sang" or "lepzig" main or jis tarah ve yaaden angreji paridrishy or iske nivaasiyon main vaas karti hai
 Some of Hardy's poems, such as "the Blinded Bird") show his love for the natural world and his firm stance against animal cruelty, which is also expressed by his antisemitic views and membership of the RSPCA

 madhya europe ke swatantra rajyon ko aapas main milakar 1871 main ek raashtra-rajya va german samrajya kaa nirmaan kiya gaya
 The name of this historical process is the unification of Germany
 iske pehle yah bhubhag 39 rajyon main banta hua tha
 Out of this, the Austrian Empire and the Praja Monarchy were famous for their economic and political importance
 france kii kranti dwaara utpann naveen vichaaron se germany prabhavit hua tha
 Napoleon by his victories organized the various German-states under the rhein-union, which made the German-states realize their cohesion
 isse germany main ekta kii bhaavana kaa prasar hua
 This was the reason that the German-states offered to organize them in a formula before the Congress of Vienna, but it was ignored
 vienna congress dwaara german-rajyon kii jo naveen vyavastha kii gayi, uske anusaar unhen shithil sangh ke rup main sangathit kiya gaya or uskaa adhyaksh austria ko banaaya gaya
 Various German states were revived keeping the dynasty's interests in mind
 in rajyon ke liye ek sangheey sabha kaa gathan kiya gaya, jiskaa adhiveshan frencfort main hota tha
 Its members were nominated by the kings of various states and not elected by the public
 ye shaasha naveen vichaaron ke virdohi the or rashtriya ekta kii baat ko naapsand karte the kintu german rajyon kii janata main rashtriyata or swatantraaa kii bhaavana vidyaman thi
 This new system was such that Austria dominated there
 is german kshetra main lagbhag 39 rajya the jinka ek sangh banaaya gaya tha
 Chungikar had different rules in different states of Germany, which caused a lot of hindrance in the business development there
 is baadha ko dur karne ke liye german rajyon ne milakar chungi sangh kaa nirmaan kiya
 It was a type of trade union, which was held annually
 is sangh kaa nirnay sarvasammat hota tha
 Now the same type of customs duty was imposed in all German states
 is vyavastha se germany ke vyapaar kaa vikaas hua, saath hi isane vahaan ekta kii bhaavana kaa sutarapaat bhi kiya
 Thus, the sense of political unity gained momentum from this economic integration
 vastav main, german rajyon ke ekikaran kii disha main yah pehla mahatvapurn kadam tha
 The national spirit was working among the people of Germany
 desh ke andar anek gupt samitiyaan nirmit hui thim
 These committees were spreading new ideas
 yahi kaaran tha ki 1830 i 
 or 1848 i
 main france main hone vaali krantiyon kaa prabhaav vahaan bhi padaa or vahaan kii janata ne bhi vidroh kar diya
 Although these revolutions did not succeed, yet political consciousness emerged among the people of the country
 1860 i 
 main jab italy kii rashtriya ekta kaa kaary kaaphi kuch puraa ho gaya tab german janata main bhi aashaa kaa sanchaar hua or vah bhi ekikaran kii disha main gatisheel hui
 The work of unification of Italy was being done under the leadership of the King of Piedmont
 isi tarah german deshbhakton ne prasha ke netritv main germany ke ekikaran ke kaary ko sampann karne kaa nishchay kiya
 At this time, the ruler of the administration was William i and Chancellor Bismarck, but these German patriots had two major problems - auto edward leopold bismark kaa janm 1815 i
 main brandenburg ke ek kuleen parivaar main hua tha
 Bismarck was educated in Berlin
 1847 i
 main hi vah prasha kii pratinidhi-sabha kaa sadsy chunaa gaya
 He represented Prasha in the Parliament of German states
 vah naveen vichaaron kaa prabal virdohi tha
 In 1859 AD he was appointed as Germany's ambassador to Russia
 1862 i
 main vah paris kaa rajdoot banaakar bheja gaya
 While staying in these positions, he came in contact with many people
 use europe kii raajnneetik sthiti ko bhi samajhane kaa avasar mila
 In 1862 AD, William I, the ruler of Prussia, appointed him the chancellor of the country
 bismark ‘rakt or lohe kii niti' kaa samarthak tha
 He was not interested in democracy and parliamentary method
 vah sena or raajnneeti ke kaary main vishesh ruchi rakhata tha
 Dependent on these, he wanted to achieve his objectives
 vah prasha ko sainik drushti se majboot kar europe kii raajnneeti main uske varchasv ko kaayam karnaa chahta tha
 He wanted to unify Austria under the leadership of Prasha, by expelling Austria from the German Union
 vah sabhaaon or bhaashanon main vishwaas nahin karata tha
 He wanted to solve the problems of the country by military and weapons
 vah avaidhanik kaary karne se bhi nahin hichakataa tha
 He completed the task of unification of the German states by increasing the military power of Prasha and resorting to diplomacy
 is kaary ko puraa karne ke liye usne teen pramukh yuddh lade
 He succeeded in all these wars and completed the task of unification of German-states
 isse europea itihaas kaa swaroop hi badal gaya
 Bismarck first attacked the Kingdom of Denmark with his power
 germany or denmark ke bich do pradesh vidyaman the, jinke naam shlesvig or hallstin the
 These two territories had been in the possession of Denmark for centuries, but were not part of it
 hallstin kii janata german jati kii thi, jabaki shlesvig main aadhe german or aadhe den the
 Like other countries in the 19th century, there was a wave of nationalism in Denmark, due to which the Dan patriots tried to unify the country
 ve chaahate the ki ukt donon rajyon ko denmark main shaamil kar uski shakti ko sudrudh kar liya jaae
 As a result, in 1863, Christian Dusham, the ruler of Denmark, announced the inclusion of the said state in his kingdom
 uskaa yah kaary 1852 i
 main sampann landan samjhaute ke viruddh tha, isiilie german rajyon ne iskaa virodh kiya
 He demanded that these territories be freed from Denmark's authority
 prasha ne bhi denmark kii is niti kaa varodh kiya
 Bismarck thought that this was a favorable opportunity to wage war against Denmark
 vah in pradeshan par prasha kaa adhikaar sthapit karne kaa icchhuk tha
 He wanted to accomplish this task with the support of Austria, not alone so that there would be no adverse reaction against Prasha
 austria ne bhi is kaary main prasha kaa sahyog karnaa uchit samajha
 The reason for this was that if the administration had intervened alone in this matter, Austria's influence in Germany would have been reduced
 iske atirikt vah 1852 i
 ke landan samjhaute kaa purna rup se paalan karnaa chahta tha
 Thus both Prasha and Austria jointly decided to take military action against Denmark
 falswaroop 1864 i
 main unhone denmark par akraman kar diya
 Denmark was defeated and made a pact with the invaders
 iske anusaar use shlesvig or hallsteel ke saath-saath laineburg ke adhikaar se bhi vanchit hona padaa
 According to this agreement, the territories of Schleswig and Holstein were taken from Denmark, but there was a difference of opinion between Austria and Austria regarding the sharing of this spoil
 is prashn ko lekar donon ke bich kaaphi katutaa utpann ho gayi
 Austria was not in favor of going to war because of its internal situation while Prasha wanted to weaken Austria into the German state union through this context
 antat donon ke bich 14 agast 1865 i
 ko gestin naamak sthaan par samjhauta ho gaya, jo ‘gestin-samjhauta’ ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The agreement was as follows: yah samjhauta bismark kii kootnithik vijay thi
 He considered it a temporary compromise that could be disregarded at any time
 atah aage chalakar iske khilaaf pratikriya hona swaabhaavik thi
 In fact, Bismarck's desire was to defeat Austria in the war and expel it from the German Union
 is disha main usne taiyaari kerani aarambh kar di thi par yah kaary saral na tha, kyonki austria europe kaa ek mahatvapurn rajya tha or us par akraman karne se antarrashtriya sambandhon par asar pad saktaa tha
 Therefore, before taking military action against Austria, Bismarck wanted to know the intent of other states
 is prakaar yuddh ke purv usne kootnithik chaal dwaara anya rajyon kii sambhavit pratikriya ko samaj lenaa aavashyak samajha
 Great Britain was unlikely to interfere in this war, as it was following a policy of isolation
 rus bismark kaa mitra tha
 He lured France and received assurance of neutrality in the war
 nepolian tritiy ne tatasth rahanaa rashtriya hit main uchit samajha
 He thought that his power would be weakened by the wars of Austria and Prussia, and from that position France would have the opportunity to develop
 1866 i
 main prasha or italy ke bich sandhi ho gayi, jiske anusaar italy ne yuddh main prasha kaa saath dene kaa aashwaasan diya
 In return, Bismarck pledged to give Italy to Venetia after succeeding in the war
 is sandhi kii soochna paakar austria bada chintit hua
 Now the military preparations of Austria and Prasha started going at a rapid pace
 is prakaar prasha or austria ke bich yuddh kii sthiti nirmit ho gayi
 Now there was only need to find opportunities for war
 shlesvig or hallstin sambandhi samjhaute main yuddh ke kaarnon ko found nikaalnaa koi kathin kaary na tha
 In 1866 AD, Prasha got this opportunity and declared war against Austria
 italy prasha kaa saath de rahaa tha
 The battle lasted for seven weeks between the two in the plain of Sedova, in which Austria was defeated
 is yuddh kii samaapti praha kii sandhi dwaara hui, jisaki sharten is prakaar thim- This war ended Austria's domination of the German states
 ab vahaan prasha kaa prabhaav kaayam ho gaya
 After this war, Prasha got many new territories, due to which now he was considered a powerful state of Europe
 ab bismark bhi europe main ek mahatvapurn vyakti ban gaya
 This success of Prasha indirectly indicated the future defeat of France
 is prakaar is yuddh se prasha ko anek laabh hue
 Hanover, Heskessel, Naso and Frankfurt were included in the kingdom of Prussia
 iske baad usne german-rajyon ko naye sire se apane netritv main sangathit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 But due to the opposition of the south-states, it was not possible to do so
 aisi sthiti main yah uchit samajha gaya ki chaar dakshin german rajyon ko chhodkar shesh german-rajyon kaa sanghathan prasha ke netritv main bana liya jaae
 Bismarck did the same
 is prakaar usne uttari german rajyon kaa gathan kar liya
 It consisted of 21 German states
 is naveen sangh kaa adhyaksh prasha ko banaaya gaya
 Bismarck was appointed the first chancellor of this association
 vah vahaan gathit hone vaali sangheey parishad kaa adhyaksh bhi niyukt kiya gaya
 There were a total of 43 members in this council, out of which 17 members belonged to Prasha
 sangh ke adhyaksh ke rup main prasha ke raja ko anek mahatvapurn kaaryon jaise yuddh evam sandhi ko sampadit karne kaa adhikaar tha
 The second assembly was named Lok Sabha, whose members were elected by the public according to adult suffrage

 There are some issues related to epilepsy in children that can affect their childhood
 kuch prakaar kii mirgee bachapan bitne ke baad samaapt ho jaatin hai
 About 70% of children who had epilepsy in childhood get rid of it when they grow up
 kuch mirgee ke aise bhi daure hai jaise febrael daura jo bachapan main keval ek baar aate hai or baad main kabhi nahin
 All human activities are controlled and conducted by the brain
 mastishk evam sharir kii koshikaon ke madhya vidyut tarangon kaa pravaah hota he
 Due to this, we are able to do various tasks
 mastishk kii koshikaaye bijli ke switch jaisaa kaam karti hai, jo apane aap jarurat ke anuroop vidyut pravahon kaa sanchaalan karti he
 Sometimes there is a disturbance in the automation of this electric current and the flow of electric waves becomes very high for a while, as if there has been an electric storm in the brain
 is gadabadi ke kaaran vyakti kaa sampark apane aas-paas ke vaataavaran se jaise tut sa jaataa he, uske sharir evam chetana main parivartan dikhaai dene lagate hai jese-behoshee yaa jatke kaa aana, uske vyavhaar or kriyakalapon main parivartan yaa sharir ke kisi ek hisse main jaise munh yaa ungaliyon main khinchaav aana ityadi
 Thus, epilepsy can occur at any time of life, but this disease starts in most people for the first time in childhood or adolescence
 kyoki jivan kii yah avasthaa bachche ke sampoorn vikaas ke liye atyaadhik mahatvapurn he atah yah jaruri he ki isaki pahchaan evam rokthaam ke upaay turant kiye jaaen
 In the absence of proper treatment, epilepsy can cause many problems in children such as educational, emotional and behavioral problems
 mirgee ke bare main ek aam galat dharna yah he ki isamen marij ko hameshaa behoshee ke jatke evam khinchaav aate hai
 Epilepsy found in children can be of many types, often undetectable
 pahchaanane main pareshaani kii kai kaaran hai, jaise : Some examples: In a child at the age of two months, there was some moment of stretch in the arms and legs of one side
 chunki yah bahut thode samay ke liye rahata tha or bachche ko jab tak maan god main leti thi tab tak samaapt ho jaataa tha, ve samajhate rahe baccha kisi karanvash dar rahaa he
 But the same child could not even handle the neck until the age of eight months, then he was taken to the doctor and the doctor recognized the epilepsy and started his medication
 atah ham dekh sakate hai ki jaankaree ke abhaav main, mirgee kaa ilaaj samay se na shuru kar paane ke kaaran bachche kaa vikaas kis tarah prabhavit ho gaya
 Another example is of an eight-year-old child, who until a while ago was very intelligent in studies etc
 kuch dinon se yah dekha jane laga ki vah kuch kshanon ke liye apane vaataavaran se cat sa jaataa jaise bolte-bolte bich main hathaat bina vajah ruuk janaa or phir kuch der baad vahiin se baat shuru karnaa jahaan se vah ruuk gaya tha
 During this time his eyes remained closed and his mouth was open
 aise daure use din main anekon baar padate the
 His weakness in studies was deemed not to pay attention to the child and the child often got reprimanded
 yah silsilaa us samay tak chalaa jab tak ki uski maan ne doordarshan par mirgee ke lakshan ke bare main kaarykram nahin dekh liya
 By getting treatment, now this child is able to concentrate in studies as before
 in do udaahranon se yah baat spasht ho jaati he ki mirgee ke dauron ko pahchaanane ke liye abhibhavakon ko sahi jaankaree kii jarurat he
 In general, epileptic seizures in children are of the following types: ise 'badi mirgee' bhi kah sakate hai
 In this, the child becomes unconscious and initially all the muscles of the body swell, causing a scream like sound from his mouth, sometimes the tongue is cut, urine comes and the child falls to the ground
 iske baad puure sharir main mirgee ke jatke yaa khinchaav aane lagate hai, or munh se jhaag nikalataa he
 This attack usually lasts for one to two minutes, then the child remains unconscious for a while, or he falls asleep, during this time he feels tired, pain in head or body and weakness
 is prakaar kii mirgee ke dauraan kuch secondon main liye bachche kii najar sthir ho jaati he, jaise ki kahin kho sa gaya he
 Together, the eyelids begin to blink rapidly, the pupils rise up on one side and from the side of the mouth it looks as if it is chewing something
 yadi bachche ke haanth main koi cheez he to vah gir sakati he
 During that time, when he asks the child something, he cannot answer it, but it becomes very normal as soon as the tour is over
 aksar ye daure din main kai baar pad sakate he
 It is important that the parents of the children who have this happen should observe them carefully and keep a regular record of such visits every time, and tell them to the doctor
 is dauraan mansapeshiyon main khinchaav achaanak kuch kshanon ke liye hota he
 This stretch can also be mild and may be loud
 yah sharir ke kisi ek hisse main hi simit rah saktaa he yaa itnaa jabardast bhi ho saktaa he ki baccha achaanak se jhatka khaakar gir jaye
 This usually happens after waking up after sleeping in the morning and things start falling out of hands like tooth brushes etc
 maans peshiyon ke tone main achaanak kami ke kaaran baccha gir jaataa he
 Within a few seconds, within a minute, he starts to move back to normal again
 yadi kisi bachche ko is tarah ke daure bahut adhik aate hon to yah jaruri he ki uske sir ko surakshit rakhane ke liye bachche ko kuch pahanaaya jaye
 Often such visits are not considered as a symptom of physical weakness
 iske dauraan sharir ke kisi ek hisse jaise ungali, angootha yaa kisi bhi bhaag main jatke aate hai
 The child remains awake and he realizes it, but even after wishing he cannot stop it
 yadi yah zyada der tak rah jaye to sharir ke anya bhaagon main falkar badi mirgee kaa rup bhi le saktaa he
 Another simple type of epileptic epilepsy will not shock, and the viewer from outside may not be able to know quickly, but if the child is of expressive age then he can complain as if he can see or hear something
 Which is not visible or heard to others
 use achaanak bhay bhi lag saktaa he, gussa aa saktaa he yaa bina vajah khush najar aane lagata he
 Sometimes a child may complain of a strange smell, others may feel strange in the stomach, may feel like vomiting
 baccha kuch vibhramit sa lag saktaa he or thodi der baad sona chaah saktaa he
 He does not have a memory of what is happening during the couplets
 praayah in dauron ko bhi bachche kii badmaashi samaj kar dhyaan nahin diya jaataa he
 It is often seen in children from three months to three years old
 aksar is dauraan yadi baccha baitha he to uskaa sir aage kii taraf jhook jaayegaa, or donon haath aage kii taraf nikal jate hai lagegaa jaise vah salaam kar rahaa he
 If asleep, the knees suddenly turn upwards, hands and head are bent forward
 aksar aise daure ek baar shuru hone par kuch-kuch interval par baar-baar hote rahete hai
 And it is important that the advice of a doctor is taken immediately
 yah jaruri he ki jab bhi abhibhavak ko jaraa bhi shaq ho to kisi sakasham chikitsak se jarur salaah karen
 Sometimes it is not possible for doctors to make sure because they do not see the child all the time
 atah yadi aapako lagata he ki ullikhit lakshanadi bachche main baar-baar dikhaai de rahe hai to aap use vistaar se note karen or apane doctor ko batalaayein
 This is also important because different types of epilepsy have different medications, and the doctor will know the type of epilepsy only when you give the correct information

 O! say can you see by the dawn’s early light,what so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming,whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,o’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?and the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air,gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;o! say does that star-spangled banner yet wave,o’er the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep, Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which breeze, o'er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, In full glory reflected now shines in the stream: 'tis the star-spangled banner, O! long may it waveo'er the land of the free and the home of the brave
 And where is that band who so vauntingly sworethat the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion,a home and a country, should leave us no more?their blood has washed out their foul footsteps’ pollution
no refuge could save the hireling and slavefrom the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:and the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,o’er the land of the free and the home of the brave
 O! Thus be it ever, when freemen shall standbetween their loved home and the war's desolation
