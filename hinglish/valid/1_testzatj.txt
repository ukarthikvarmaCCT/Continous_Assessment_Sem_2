 The names of many early Christian martyrs were Valentin
 1969 tak, catholic carch ne aupchaarik rup se gyaarah vailemtine dinon ko manyata di
 Valentines honored on 14 February are Valentin Valentinus Presbam of Rome
 Romé) and Terni's valentines
 Valentin of Rome was a clergyman from Rome who was martyred around 269 AD and was buried in Via Flaminia
 unke avshesh rome ke saint praxd carch main or dublin, ireland ke whitefrior street carmelit carch main hai
 Valentin of Terni became Bishop of Interamna in AD 197 and is said to have been assassinated during the oppression of the Aurelian Emperor
 unhen bhi vaaya fleminiya main hi gaada gaya he, lekin gaadne kaa sthaan rome ke vailemtine se alag he
 His remains are on the Basilica of Saint Valentin in Terni
 catholic vishwakosh ek tisare sant ke bare main bhi zikr karata he jinka naam vailemtine tha or jinka zikr shuruaati shahaadaton main 14 farbari kii taarikh ke andar aata he
 He was martyred in Africa with his many companions, but not much is known about him
 inamen se kisi bhi shahid kii shuruaati mul madhyakaalin jivaniyon main romani tatwon kaa koi zikr nahin he
 By the time a Saint Valentin relationship with love in the fourteenth century, the distinctions between Valentin of Rome and Valentin of Terni were completely lost
 vartmaan santon ke roman catholic calendar ke 1969 ke sanshodhan main, farvari 14 par sant vailemtine ke fistde ko general roman calendar se nikaal kar vishisht calandaron main nimnlikhit kaarnon se daal diya gaya: haalaanki saint vailemtine kii yaadgaar pracheen he, use vishisht calandaron ke liye chhod diya gaya, kyonki, unke naam ke alaava, saint vailemtine ke bare main kuch bhi gyaat nahin he sivaay iske kii inhen vaaya fleminiya main 14 farbari ko dafnaaya gaya tha
 Feast Day is still celebrated today in Balzan, where it is claimed that the remains of St
 have been found and are also celebrated throughout the world by the traditionalist Catholics who follow the old pre-vatican II calendar
 shuruaati madhyakaalin acta kaa uddhran bid ke dwaara kiya gaya tha or leganda oriya main sankshep main vyaakhyaan kiya gaya he
 According to that version, Saint Valentin was persecuted as a Christian and personally questioned by the Emperor Claudius II of Rome
 clodius vailemtine se prabhavit the or unke saath charchaa kii thi, koshish kii thi ki roman paagaanism main unka dharmantaran ho jaye taaki unki jaan bachaai ja sake
 Valentin refused and on the contrary tried to become Claudius Christian
 Because of this, he was executed
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki maare jane se pehle unhonen jailer kii andhi beti ko thik karne kaa chamatkaar kiya tha
 Legenda Oria was still unable to make any connection with love, so legends were added to modern times
 inamen vailemtine ko ek aise padri ke rup main dikhaaya gaya jisane roman samraat clodius II ke ek kanoon ko manane se inkaar kar diya tha jiske anusaar jawan ladakon ko shaadi na karne kaa hukum diya gaya tha
 The Emperor may have done this to increase his army, he must have believed that married boys are not good soldiers
 padri vailemtine is bich chupake se jawan logon kii shaadiyaan karavaaya karte the
 When Claudius came to know about this, he arrested Valentin and threw him in jail
 is sundar danta katha ko or alankrita karne ke liye kuch anya kisse jode gaye
 The evening before he was killed, he wrote the first "valentine" himself, the name of a young woman believed to be his girlfriend
 ye yuvati jailer kii putree thi jise unhone thik kiya tha or baad main mitrataa ho gayi thi
 It was a note that said "by your valentine" aisa hi ek diwas pracheen faras main vailemtine diwas ke bhi bahut pehle se manaaya jaataa tha
 It was known as the Day of Love and Lovers
 haalaanki prachlit aadhunik strot anirdisht greeko-roman farbari kii chhuttiyon, jinhen kaha jaataa tha ki ve prajnan or prem ke liye samarpit thim, ko saint vailemtine ke saath jodate hai, professor jaik oruch, kainsaas vishwa vidhyalay ke, kaa tark tha kii chausar se pehle, romani prem or velentins naamak sant ke bich koi sambandh nahin tha
 According to the ancient Athenian calendar, the period between mid-january and mid-february was the month of the Gamelion, dedicated to the holy wedding of Zeus and Hara
 pracheen rome main, luperkelia, farvari 13 se 15 tak manaaya jane vaala, ek pracheen rivaaj tha jo kii prajnan se judaa tha
 Lupercalia was a local festival in the city of Rome
 juno februa kaa tyohaar, jiskaa arth tha "shuddh karne vaala juno" yaa "chest juno", farvari 13-14 ko manaaya jaataa tha
 Pope Gelasias i abolished Lupercalia
 aisa aamtaur par mana jaataa he ki chrishchiyan carch ne vailemtine fist de ko farvari ke madhya main manaane kaa nirnay isliye kiya taaki pagaan luparkelia ko isaikrut kiya ja sake
 The Roman Catholic Church could not end the deeply settled Luparcellia festival, so the Church reserved a day to honor the Virgin Mary
 haalaanki kuch kaa aisa daawa he ki vailemtine diwas kaa prem ke saath sambandh pehali baar jeffri chausar krit parlment of fouls main darj he, lekin ye ek galat anuwaad kaa parinaam bhi ho saktaa he
 Chaucer wrote: for this vaas on saint volantynys de vahan eueri bread komyth tere to chess hiss make
 The poem was written in honor of King Richard II of England's first anniversary of Anne Sesgai of Bohemia
 shaadi ke liye ek sandhi par 2 may 1381 main hastakshar hue the
 It is assumed by readers without reasoning that Chaucer is referring to February 14 as Valentine's Day; However, mid-february is not an appropriate time for breeding birds in England
 henry ansgar keli ne ishaara kiya he ki litargical calendar main, 2 may genoa ke vailemtine ke liye sant diwas he
 It was an early Bishop of Saint Valentin Genoa who died around 307 AD
 chausar ki parliament of fouls ki kahani ek puraani parampara ke kaalpanik sandarbh main he, lekin sachai main chausar ke pehle aisi koi parampara nahin thi
 Presenting the approximate description of emotional practices as historical facts, has its origins by eighteenth-century historians, such as Alban Butler, author of Butler's Lives of Saints, and the practice has been continued by modern scholars
 sabase ullekhneey he, "ye vichaar ki vailemtine diwas kii pratha roman luperkelia kii vajah se aayi thi, isko bina kisi tark ke sweekaar gaya he or anekon prakaar main isko aaj bhi doharaaya jaataa rahaa he
 a "high Court of Love" was established in 1400 in Paris on Valentine's Day, using the court language for customs of civilized love
 pyaar ke anubandhon, dhokhaa or mahilaon ke khilaaf hinsa se ye adaalat nipatati thi
 The judges were selected on the basis of women reading a poem
 charles, orleens ke duk, dwaara apni "vailemtine" patni ke liye likhi gayi pandrahavi sadi kii ek bhent vailemtine kii bachi hui sabase puraani kriti he, jo shuruyaat karti he
 At that time the Duke was placed in the Tower of London after being caught in 1415 by the Battle of Agincourt

 ' It is a multiple word
 computer virus yaa computer vishaanu ek computer program he jo apni anulipi kar saktaa he or upyogkarta kii anumati ke bina ek computer ko sankramit kar saktaa he or upyogkarta ko iskaa pataa bhi nahin chalata he
 The term "virus" is also commonly used in reference to various types of malware and adware programs, although it is sometimes mistaken
 mul virus anulipiyon main parivartan kar saktaa he, yaa anulipiyaan khud apane aap main parivartan kar sakati hai, jaisaa ki ek roopantarit virus main hota he
 a virus can spread from one computer to another only when its host is brought to an uninfected computer, for example by a user sending it to a network or the Internet, or by removing it from a removable medium such as a floppy disk, CD , Or by bringing on a USB drive
 Simultaneously, the virus can spread to other computers through infected files on a file system or network system that can be opened on other computers
 Sometimes the word virus was used for computer worm and Trojan hoses
 goes
 ek keeda anya computaron main khud failaa saktaa he ise poshi ke ek bhagya ke rup main sthanantarit hone kii zarurat nahin hoti he or ek trogen horse ek aisi fil he jo hanirahit prathit hoti he
 Worms and Trojan horses can damage a computer system's data, functional performance, or networking during performance
 saamaanya taur par, ek keedaa vastav main system ke hardware yaa software ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaata, jabaki kam se kam siddhant rup main, ek trogen pelod, nishpaadan ke dor kisi bhi prakaar kaa nuksaan pahunchne main sakasham hota he
 When the program is not running, nothing appears but the Trojan horse enters as soon as the infected code runs
 yahi kaaran he ki logon ke liye virus or anya mailaware ko khojna bahut hi kathin hota he or isiilie unhen spyware program or panjikaran prakriya kaa upyog karnaa padataa he
 Nowadays, most personal computers are connected to the Internet and the locker area network and the local area network facilitates the process of spreading corrupted code
 aaj kaa virus network sevaao kaa bhi laabh uthaa saktaa he jaise world wide web, i mail, twarit sandesh or sanchika saajha pranaliyaan virason or keedon ko failane main madad karti hai
 In addition, some sources use an alternative terminology, in which a virus is a form of self-duplicating malware
 kuch melware, vinaashkari prograamon, sanchikaon ko delit karne, yaa hard discs kii punah formating karne ke dwaara computer ko kshati pahuchane ke liye program kiye jate hai
 Other malware programs are not built for any damage, but simply duplicate themselves and perhaps make their presence known by a text, video, or audio message
 yahan tak kii ye kam ashubh mailaware program bhi computer upyogkarta ke liye samasyaayen utpann kar sakate hai
 
they usually take control of the computer memory used by legitimate programs
 iske parinamswaroop, ve aksar aniyamit vyavhaar kaa kaaran hote hai or system ko nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 Additionally, many malware are prone to bugs, and these bugs can damage the system or cause data loss
 kai siaidi program aise program hai jo upyogkarta dwaara downlod kiye gaye hai or har baar pop ap kiye jate hai
 As a result, the speed of the computer is greatly reduced but it is very difficult to find and stop the problem
 sabase pehla virus kreeper tha jo arapanet, par khoja gaya, jo 1970 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main internet se pehle aayaa tha
 It was spread by the TENEX operating system and could use any connected modem to control and infect the computer
 yah sandesh pradarshit kar saktaa he ki "main kreeper hoon; agar pakad sakate ho to mujhe pakado"
 yah afvaah thi ki reeper program, jo iske kuch hi samay baad prakat hota he or kreeper kii pratiyaan banaata he or unhen hataa detaa he, ise sambhavatya kreeper ke nirmaataa ke dwaara khed patr main likhaa gaya he
 There is a common belief that a program called "rother J" was the first computer virus to appear "in the wild" —it was created outside a computer or in a laboratory, but this claim was false
 anya haal hi ke virason ke liye jane-maane computer virason or keedon kii samay rekha dekhen
lekin yah " ghar main " computaron ko sankramit karne vaala pehla virus tha
 Written by Richard Scranta, in 1982, it integrated itself with the Apple DOS 3
3 operating system and was spread by floppy disks
 The virus was originally a joke created by a high school student and was intended as a game
 Put on a floppy disk
 iske 50 wein upyog par Elk Cloner virus sakriy ho gaya, jisane computer ko sankramit kiya or yah ek choti kavita ko prardashit karata tha " Elk cloner:the program with a personality"
in di wild pehla pisi virus ek boot kshetra kaa virus tha jo brain Brain) kehalaata tha, ise faruk alvi bros ke dwaara 1986 main banaaya gaya, tathaa lahore, pakistan ke baahar sanchalit kiya gaya
 They created this alleged virus to prevent theft of copies of the software they had created
 However, analysts claimed that the Ashar virus, a species of the brain, probably pre-dated it based on the code inside the virus
 isse pehle kii computer network vyapak hote adhikansh virus hathaaye jane yogya madhyam, vishesh rup se flopy discs par fail gaye
 In the early days, regular exchange of information and programs was done by floppies among many users of personal computers
 kai virus in discon par upasthit sankramit prograamon se faile, jabaki kuch ne apane aap ko discs ke boot kshetra main install kar liya, isse yah sunishchit ho gaya kii jab upyogkarta computer ko discs se boot karegaa to yah anjaane main hi chal jayega
us samay ke pi si pehle flopi se boot karne kaa prayaas karte the, yadi koi flopi drive main rah gai he
 This was the most successful transition strategy until the use of floppies was reduced, making it easier to create viruses in the wild boot sector
 paaramparik computer virus 1980 ke dashak main ubhare, aisa nijee computer kaa upyog badhane ke kaaran hua or iske parinaam swarup BBS or modem kaa upyog, tathaa software kaa aadan-pradaan bad gaya
 Bulletin board software exchanges directly spread Trojan horse programs and viruses were created to infect popular commercial software
 shairwayre or bootleg BBS ke virus ke liye aam vaahak the
 In the "pirate Scene" of Hobists, a virus that contains illegal copies of retail software can send a web address link as an instant message to all contacts on an infected machine
 yadi praptakarta, yah sochataa he ki link ek mitra se he, vah web sait par link kaa anusaran karata he, sait par upasthit virus is nae computer ko sankramit karne main samarth ho saktaa he or apana prasar karne lagata he
 The latest site of the virus family is the cross-site scripting virus
 This virus emerged from research and was demonstrated academically in 2005
 yah virus kros sait patakatha kaa upyog karke prasaarit hota he
 Since 2005 in the wild, there have been many examples of cross-site scripting viruses, the most notable affected sites being myspace and Yahoo
 apane aap kii anulipi karne ke liye, ek virus ko code kaa nishpaadan karne kii tathaa smriti par likhane kii anumati honi chahie is kaaran se, kai virus apane aap ko nishpaadan yogya filon se sanlagn kar lete hai jo uchit program kaa hissaa ho saktaa he
 If a user tries to start an infected program, then it is possible that the code of the virus is executed first
 Viruses can be divided into two types, based on their behavior and their performance
 Resident viruses quickly find other cells that can be infected, infect these targets, and eventually control application programs
 But transfer what they have infected
 nivasee virus poshi kii talash nahin karte hai jab ve shuru hote hai
 Instead, a resident virus loads itself into memory upon execution and transfers control to the host program
 virus prishth bhoomi main sakriy rahata he or nae poshiyon ko sankramit karata he jab in filon ko anya prograamon yaa khud oparating system ke dwaara acces kiya jaataa he
 It is believed that the non-resident virus consists of a finder module and a replication module
 khojak modul sankraman hetu nai filein khojane ke liye uttaradaayi hota he
 For each new executable file, the finder module attacks, calling the duplication module to infect the file
 nivasee virus main ek anulipi modul hota he jo ek anivaasee virus ke dwaara niojit anulipi modul ke samaan hota he
 Although this module is not called by the finder module
 iske bajaay, virus anulipi modul ko smriti main lod karata he jab iskaa nishpaadan hota he or yah sunishchit kar letaa he ki har baar jab oparating system ek nishchit aaparishan kaa pradarshan karata he to is modul kaa nishpaadan hota he
 For example, each time the operating system executes a file, duplicate modules can be called
 is maamle main, virus computer par nishpadit hone vaale prayek upyukt program ko sankramit kar detaa he
 Occasionally, resident viruses are further subdivided into two categories, one acute infectious and the other slow infective
 The fast infectious is designed to infect as many files as possible
 For example, an acute infectious access infects every possible host file
 yah ek virus rodhi soft ware ke liye ek vishesh samasya he, chunki ek virus scanner har sambhav poshi sanchika ko akses kar legaa jab yah system kaa vyapak scan karata he
 If the virus scanner fails to notice that such a virus is present in memory, the virus attacks the scanner from behind and thus infects all the files being scanned
 teevr sankramak apane prasar ke liye teevr sankraman dar par bharosa karte hai
 The disadvantage of this method is that infecting multiple files makes it more likely to be detected, as the virus slows down the computer or performs many suspicious actions that can be detected by anti-virus software
 duusari or dhime sankramak, is prakaar se banaaye jate hai ki ve poshi ko an-aavruth rup se sankramit karte hai
 For example, some slow infects infect files only when they are being copied
 dhime sankramak ki simit kriya ki vajah se unka pataa lagaana aasaan nahin hota he: ve computer ko bahut adhik dhimaa nahin karte hai, par baar-baar virus virdohi soft ware ko jhatka dete hai jise prograamon ke sandigdh vyavhaar ke dwaara pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 Slow infectives don't seem very successful, virason ne bhinn prakaar ke prasar madhyamon yaa poshiyon ko lakshya banaaya he
 This list cannot end: pdfs, jaise HTML, durbhaavnapurna code se sambandhit ho saktaa he
 What some virus writers have written has no significance
 EXE vistaar ke ant parofngh, ummid he ki upyogkarta vishwast fil ke prakaar par ruk jayega, vah is baat par dhyaan nahin degaa kii computer antim prakaar kii sanchika ke saath prarambh hoga
 trogen harse ) dekhen To avoid detection by the user, some viruses perform various types of deception
 kuch puraane virus, vishesh rup se MS - DOS manch par, yah sunishchit kar lete hai ki jab sanchika ko virus ke dwaara sankramit kiya jaataa he to poshi sanchika ke " antim baar sanshodhit " hone kii dinaank bani rahati he
 Although this approach does not fool anti-virus software, especially those that maintain dates for cyclic redundancy checks on file changes
 kuch virus apane aakaar ko badhaaye bina or sanchikaon ko kshati pahuchaye bina sanchikaon ko sankramit kar sakate hai
 They do this by overwriting unused fields of executable files
 ye cavity virus kehalaata he
 For example, the CIH virus, or the Chernobyl virus, infects portable executable files
 kyonki un sanchikaon main kai khaali sthaan the, virus jo 1 KB lambaai kaa tha, sanchika ke aakar main nahin judaa
kuch virus virus virdohi software ke kaary ko khatm karke apane aap ko prakat nahin hone dete hai, isse pehle ki vah uskaa pataa laga le
kyonki computer or oparating system adhik viksit or jatil ho rahe hai, chupaane ki puraani takneekon ko navinikrut karne yaa pratisthapit karne ki aavashyaktaa he
 To protect a computer from viruses, the demand may be that the file system migrates to the detailed and explicit permission for all types of file access
 ek virus ke liye aage failane ke liye poshiyon ko sankramit karne ki zarurat hoti he
 In some cases, infecting a host may be a bad idea
 For example, many anti-virus programs check the integrity of their code
 isliye aise prograamon kaa sankraman is sambhaavna ko badhayega ki is virus kaa pataa chal gaya he
 For this reason, some viruses do not infect programs that are part of anti-virus software
 ek anya prakaar kaa poshi jisase virus kabhi kabhi bachane ki koshish karata he vah he bat sanchikaaye
bat sanchikaaye ve sanchikaaye hai jo ki vishesh rup se virus virdohi software yaa khud virus virdohi peshewaron ke dwaara ek virus ke dwaara sankramit hone ke liye banaai gai hai
 These files can be created for different reasons, all of them are related to virus detection
 chunki bat sanchikaon kaa upyog virus kaa pataa lagane main yaa jaanch ko sambhav banane main kiya jaataa he, virus ke dwaara sankraman nahin hone kaa laabh uthaaya ja saktaa he
 Viruses typically do this by avoiding virus programs, such as small program files or programs that have specific patterns of 'garbage instructions'
 a related strategy to make batting difficult is sparse infection
 Sometimes, sparse Infectious do not infect a host file which may be a suitable candidate for infection in other conditions
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek virus yadrichhik aadhaar par tay kar saktaa he ki ek sanchika ko sankramit karnaa he yaa nahin, yaa ek virus saptaah ke vishesh dinon main hi poshi sanchikaon ko sankramit kar saktaa he
 Some viruses try to trick anti-virus software by requesting the operating system
 virus virdohi software sanchika ko padhne kaa anurodh karata he or yah anurodh OS ke bajaay virus ko jaataa he, is prakaar se ek virus apane aap ko chupa letaa he
 The anti-virus software now rolls over the uninfected version of the file, making it appear that the file is "clean"
 aadhunik virus virdohi software ke paas virus kii chori kaa pataa lagane ke liye kai takneekein hai
 The only reliable method of preventing theft is to boot through a medium that is clean
 adhikansh virus virdohi program saadhaaran prograamon ke bheetar virus praturup khojane ki koshish karte hai ise tathakthith virus ke hastakshar kaha jaataa he
 a signature is a figurative byte pattern, which is a part of a particular virus or virus family
 yadi ek virus scanner ek sanchika main aisa praturup khoj letaa he, yah upyogkarta ko suchit kar detaa he ki sanchika sankramit he
 Users can then delete this file, or "clean" or "fix" the infected file
 kuch virus aisi takneekon kaa upyog karte hai ki jo hastakshar ke dwaara iskaa pataa lagane ko mushkil hi nahin balki asambhav bana detaa he
 These viruses change their code on each infection
 arthath prayek sankramit sanchika main virus kii ek alag prajati hoti he
 a more advanced method for encrypting viruses is the use of simple encryption
 In this case, the virus consists of a small decrypting module and an encrypted copy of the virus's code
 yadi prayek sankramit sanchika ke liye virus ek alag kunjee se ancrypted he, to virus kaa keval ek bhaag sthir bana rahata he vah he decrypting modul, jo ke ant se sanlagn hoga
is maamle main, ek virus scinar hastakshar kaa upyog karke sidhe virus kaa pataa nahin laga saktaa, lekin yah fir bhi dicripting modul kaa pataa laga saktaa he, jo sambhav virus kii abhi bhi apratyaksh jaanch kar saktaa he
 Since these will be keys stored on the infected host, it is actually possible to decode the last virus, but this is probably not necessary, since the self-modified code is so rare that it causes the virus scanner to at least record the suspicious file
 Can
 ek puraane lekin compact, ancripshan main ek sthir virus ki prayek bit xoring shaamil he, taaki oparation kaa dohraan keval dicripshan ke liye ho
yah sandigdh code he jo apane aap ko sanshodhit karata he, isliye kai virus paribhaashaon main ancripshan / dicripshan hastakshar kaa ek bhaag ho saktaa he
 Polymorphic code was the first technology that posed a serious threat to the virus screener
 Like regular encrypted viruses, a polymorphic virus infects files with its encrypted code, which is decoded by a decryption module
 bahurupi virus ke maamle main, yah dicripshan modul bhi prayek sankraman par sanshodhit hota he
 Therefore properly written polymorphic viruses have no parts that are similar in infections, making it difficult to detect using signatures
 virus virdohi software ek pratidwandvi kaa upyog karke decrypting ke dwaara iskaa pataa laga saktaa he, yaa ancrypted virus sharir ke sankhyikeey praturup vishleshan ke dwaara iskaa pataa laga saktaa he
 To enable polymorphic code, a virus must have a polymorphic engine somewhere in its encrypted body
 See polymorphic code for technical detail on how such engines work
 Some viruses require polymorphic code to work in this way In that it mainly binds the rate of mutation of the virus
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek virus keval kuch hi samay main utparivartit hone ke liye program kiya jaataa he, yaa ise is prakaar se program kiya ja saktaa he ki jab ye computer par aisi sanchika ko sankramit kar rahaa ho jisamen pehle se virus kii anulipiyaan ho, to yah utparivartan se batch sake
 jise dhime bahurupi code kaa upyog karne kaa laabh yah he ki isse virus virdohi peshewar ke liye virus kaa pratinidhi kaa namoona praapt karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he, kyonki bat sanchikaaye jo ek baar chalane main sankramit ho jaati hai, unamem praroopik rup se virus kaa samaan namoona hoga
 ise yah sambhaavna bad jaayegi ki virus scanner ke dwaara ki gai jaanch avishwasaneey hogi or yah ho saktaa he ki virus ke kuch udhaaharan jaanch kaa pataa lagane main sakasham na hon
 Some viruses rewrite themselves each time they infect a new executable to avoid detection by simulation
 virus jo aisi takanic kaa upyog karte hai ve roopantarit kehalaate hai
 a modified engine is required to make the conversion possible
 ek roopantarit virus aamtaur par bahut bada or jatil hota he
 For example, the W32 / Simile contains more than 14000 characters of group language code, 90% of which is part of the converted engine
 jaise ek aabaadi main anuvanshik vividhta ke kam hone par usamen ek maatr rog kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he, samaan rup se ek network par software system ki vividhta kii bhi virus kii vinaashkari kshamta ko simit karti he
 This became a topic of special consideration in 1990 when Microsoft gained market dominance in desktop operating systems and office suites
 microsoft software ke upyogkarta or internet explorer ) vishesh rup se virus ke prasar ke liye kamjor hai
 The reason why Microsoft software is targeted by viruses is their desktop dominance and is often criticized for many mistakes and holes for virus writers
 samanvit or gaiyr ekikrut microsoft anuprayog or sanchika pranali ke acces ke saath bhashaaon ki patakathaon ke anuprayog, or netwarking lakshanon ke saath anuprayog) bhi vishesh rup se jokhim yukt hai
 Although Windows is the most popular operating system for virus writers, some viruses also exist on other platforms
 koi bhi oparating system jo chalane ke liye tisare paksh ke program ko anumati de saktaa he vah saidhantik rup se virus ko chalaa saktaa he
 Some operating systems are less secure than others
 Unix-based oss only allow their users to execute within a secure space under their own instructions
 internet aadhaarit ek shodh se pataa chalaa ki aise maamle bhi the jab logon ne jaan-boojh kar ek virus ko dianlod karne ke liye ek vishesh batan ko dabaaya
ek suraksha form f-secure ne ek 6 maah kaa abhiyaan google aidwards par chalaaya jisane kaha "kya aapkaa pi si virus mukt he?yah yahan sankramit praapt karen ! " 
iskaa parinaam tha 409 clic
2006 main apekshaakrit kuch suraksha ke tareeke thejo mike OS x ko lakshya bana rahe the ke saath) 
puraane appal oparating system ke liye virus ki ek sankhya jo mike oes clasik ke naam se jaani jaati he, wo alag alag sroton main bahut alag hoti he, appal ke saath kaha jaataa he ki keval chaar prakaar ke jane maane virus hote hai or swatantra sutron ke anusaar 63 virus ke rup hai
 It is safe to say that Macs are less likely to be targeted because of lower market share, and thus a Mac-specific virus can only infect a small proportion of computers
 
mex or windos ke bich virus kaa jokhim mukhya bikri bindu he, ek yah ki Apple unke ek mike praapt karen vigyaapan main kaam letaa he
 According to this, Mex also has security issues similar to Microsoft Windows, although no one in the wild has successfully taken full advantage of it
 windos or unics main samaan patakatha kii kshamta he, lekin jab unics swaabhaavik rup se saamaanya upyogkartaaon ko oparating system vaataavaran ke liye parivartan karne ke liye acces karne se roktaa he, vindos kii purani pratiyaan jaise vindos 95 or 98 aisa nahin karti
1997 main, jab ek "bliss " naamak virus Linux ke liye jari kiya gaya tha --pramukh virus virdohi vikritaon ne ek chetavanee jari kii unics kii tarah ke system thik vidos kii tarah virus kaa shikaar ban sakate hai
 Bliss virus can be considered symbolic of viruses - unlike on Unix systems -
 Bliss requires that the user run it explicitly and that it can only infect programs that are modified by the user
 Can
 vindos upyogkarta ke vipareet, adhikansh unics upyogkarta kisi software ko instul karne ke alaava kisi vyavasthaapak upyogkarta ke rup main log in nahin karte: yahan tak ki yadi ek upyogkarta virus ko chalaata he to bhi yah oparating system ko nuksaan nahin kar saktaa he
 The Bliss virus never became widespread and remained primarily a subject of research interest
 Its creator later posted its source code to Usenet, allowing researchers to learn how it mitigated
 chunki system strot kaa anaadhikrut upyog rokane ke liye software ko aksar suraksha vyavastha ke saath dijin kiya jaataa he, kai virus ek system yaa anuprayog main software bag ko failane main madad karte hai
 Software development strategies that produce a large number of bugs also normally enable efficient exploitation
 kai upyog karta virus virdohi software install karte hai, jo computer downlod ke baad yaa nishpaadan yogya ke chalane ke baad gyaat virus kaa pataa laga lete hai yaa use nasht kar dete hai
 There are two common methods that an anti-virus software application employs to detect viruses
 virus kii jaanch kii pehali or sabase saamaanya vidhi he virus ke hastakshar paribhaasha kii suchi kaa upyog
yah computer kii smriti ke avyavon or boot kshetra ) or sthaayee yaa asthaayee drivon par sangruhit sanchikaon kii jaanch ke dwaara, kaary karata he tathaa in sanchikaon kii tulana gyaat virus ke "hastakshar" ke database ke kilaaf kii jaati he
 The disadvantage of this method of investigation is that the user is only protected from viruses that keep updating their previous definitions
 duusari vidhi he anumaani kalan vidhi jisamen saamaanya vyavhaar par aadhaarit virason kaa pataa lagaaya jaataa he
 This method has the ability to detect viruses for which anti-virus companies still have to create signatures
 kuch virus virdohi program khuli hui sanchikaon ko scan karne main sakasham hote hai saath hi samaan tareeke se 'on the fly' bheje gaye or praapt kiye gaye i-mels ko bhi scan kar sakate hai
 This is called "on-access scanning"
 virus virdohi software poshi software ki virus ko preshit karne kii kshamta ko parivartit nahin karata he
 Users should update their software regularly for patch security holes
 Anti-virus software also needs to be updated regularly to prevent modern threats
 Regular backup of data on different media Can reduce the damage caused by viruses, either unconnected to the system, kept, or for other reasons such as a different file system Can not be opened for use not or only kept read-only
 is tarah, yadi ek virus ke madhyam se data kho diya he, koi bhi byaap kaa upyog karke phir se shuru kar saktaa he
 If a backup session is closed on optical media such as cds and dvds, it becomes read-only and can no longer be infected with the virus
 isi tarah, boot yogya par ek oparating system kaa upyog computer ko shuru karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, yadi sthapit aaparating system upyog hin ho gaya he
 Another method is to use different operating systems on different file systems
 a virus is unlikely to affect both
 data byaap bhi bhinn sanchika tantron par daalaa ja saktaa he
 For example, Linux requires special software to write to an NTFS partition, so if no one installs the software and uses a separate installation of MS Windows to perform a backup on an NTFS partition, the backup Any version of Linux must be protected
 Likewise, MS Windows cannot read file systems such as ext3, so if one typically uses MS Windows Ta is, backups can be made on an ext3 partition using a Linux installation
 ek baar ek computer jab virus se samjhauta kar letaa he, to saamanyatya oparating system ko fir se puri tarah se install kiye bina samaan computer kaa upyog jari rakhana asurakshit hota he
 However, there are several options that are present after the virus arrives in the computer
 ye kriyaayein virus ke prakaar kii gambhirtha par nirbhar karti hai
 On Windows Me, Windows XP and Windows Vista is a tool known as System Restore that restores the registry and complex system file for the previous check point
 aksar ek virus ek system ko heng kar detaa he or ek isi ke baad se fir se boot hone par system ke ristor bindu main usee din se samasya aegi
pichley dinon se ristor bindu ko diya gaya kaam karnaa hota he, ab virus sangrahit sanchikaon ko sankramit nahin kar paata he
 However, some viruses disable system restore and other important tools such as task manager and command prompt
 ek virus jo aisa karata he uskaa udahaaran he ciadoor
prashaskon ke paas bhinn kaarnon ke liye simit upyogkartaaon se aise aujaaron ko niskriy karne ke vikalp uplabdh hai
 The virus modifies the registry to do this, not only when the administrator is controlling the computer, all of this prevents users from accessing the tools
 jab ek sankramit aujaar sakriy hota he to yah ek sandesh detaa he "aapke prashaasak ke dwaara task menager ko aksham kar diya gaya he
 "even if the program the user is trying to open is the administrator
 upyogkarta jo microsoft oparating system ko chalaa rahaa he, ek mukt scan chalaane ke liye microsoft kii website par ja saktaa he, yadi unke paas unka 20 ankon kii panjikaran sankhya he
 Reinstalling the operating system is a different way of virus removal
 isamen saadhaaran rup se OS vibhaajan kii punah formating or iske mul madhyam se OS ko install karnaa shaamil he
 Or a partition with a clean backup image can be visualized or taken with Acronis)
 The advantage of this method is that it is simpler to perform, faster than running multiple anti-virus scans, and Also guarantees to remove malware
 Downsides main anya sabhi software or oparating system kaa punah install karnaa shaamil he
 User data can be backed up by booting a live CD or placing the hard drive on another computer and booting from that computer's operating system

 This was a temporary measure, but continuing the existence of a shared monarchy in the Indian political system was not in the true sense of a right for a sovereign nation

 Subdivisions of adaptive immunity are divided by the cells involved, the aspect of humoral immunity that is mediated by secreted antagonists, while the protection provided by cellular immunity involves t lymphocytes alone
 Humoral unmukti tab sakriy ho jaati he jab jeev apane antibody utpann karata he or niskriy jab antibody vyaktiyon ke bich sthanantarit karte hai
 Similarly, cell-mediated immunity is activated when organisms have their own t cells stimulated and inactivated when t cells come from another organism

 ISDN has two perspectives on the world
 sabase aam drushtikon antim upyogkarta kaa he, jo ghar ke telephone / data network main ek digital conection lenaa chahta he, jiskaa pradarshan ek saadhaaran analog modem conection se behatar hoga
 The end-user's specific Internet connection is related to this approach, and the discussion of the merits of various ISDN modems, carriers' offerings and tariffs is related to this perspective
 agali charchaa main se adhikansh isi drushtikon se sambandhit he, lekin is baat par dhyaan dena chahie ki ek data conection seva ke rup main, iesdn kaa zyaadaatar dsel dwaara adhikraman ho gaya he
 There is a second approach that relates to the telephone industry where ISDN is a central technology

 Typically, the PBX is coupled via a T1 with deprived bit notation to represent the on-hook or off-hook conditions and MF and DTMF tones to encode the destination number
 iesdn bahut behatar he kyonki sandeshon ko lambe tone kram tak kii sankhyaon kaa kutalekhan karne kii koshish karne kii apeksha bahut zyada teji se bheja ja saktaa he
 This results in faster call times
 iske alaava, adhik se adhik sankhya main suvidhaayen uplabdh ho jaati he or dhokhadhadi kam ho jaati he
 ISDN is also used as a smart-network technology intended to include new services in public switched telephone networks) for users to have direct access to end-to-end circuit-switched digital services

 There are two implementations of ISDN
 mul dar antarafalak ), jise mul dar acces ) bhi kehete hai — do b channelon, jisamen se prayek kaa bandwidth 64 kbit / s he or ek d channel, jiskaa bandwidth 16 kbit / s he, se milakar bana hota he
 Together these three channels can be specified as 2B + D
 praathmik dar antarafalak ), jise europe main praathmik dar acces ) bhi kehete hai — main asankhya b channel or 64 kbit / s bandwidth vaala ek d channel hota he
 The number of pri's b channels varies by country: in North America and Japan it is 23B + 1D with a total bit rate of 1
544 Mbit / s; It is 30B + 1D in Europe, India and Australia with a total bit rate of 2
048 Mbit / s
 broadband ekikrut seva digital network ), iesdn kaa ek doosraa karyanvayan he or yah ek hi samay main vibhinn prakaar kii sevaaon kaa prabandh karne main sakasham he
