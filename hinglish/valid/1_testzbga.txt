 Now they too have started saluting Gandhi ji by calling him a monk and public leader who is using Christian methods as a weapon against the Christian religious people

 shadyantr kaa siddhant ek aisa shabd he, jo mulat: kisi naagarik, aapraadhik yaa raajnneetik shadyantr ke daawey ke ek tatasth vivarnak ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 However, it later became quite derogatory and was used solely for the marginalized theory that interpreted any historical or current event as the result of a secret plot of almost superhuman power and cunning conspirators
 shadyantr ke siddhant ko vidwaanon dwaara andeh ke saath dekha jaataa he, kyonki vah shaayad hi kisi nirnaayak saboot dwaara samarthit hota he or sansthagat vishleshan ke vipareet hota he, jo saarvajanik rup se gyaat sansthaaon main logon ke samuhik vyavhaar par kendrit hoti he or jo aitihaasik or vartmaan ghatnaon kii vyakhya ke liye vidvatapurna samagriyon or mukhyadhara kii media rapaton main darj tathyon par aadhaarit hoti he, na ki ghatana ke makasad or vyaktiyon kii gupt santhganth kii karravaayiyon kii atakalon par
 Therefore, the term is often used lightly as an attempt to portray a belief, which is a bizarre lie and expressed by a group of people characterized as eccentric or hysterical
 This type of portrayal is often the subject of controversy due to its potential impropriety and inappropriateness

 They argue that it contributed to the concept of conspiracyism, which emerged as a cultural phenomenon in the United States in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and as an effective paradigm of political action in the public mind
 The conspiracy was considered as a possible replacement for democracy

 Conspiracy means "entering into a secret agreement to accomplish an illegal or wrongful act or using such methods to achieve a legitimate purpose
" However, conspiracy theory is also used to point to a descriptive mode, which involves a rigorous selection of broad arguments for the existence of larger conspiracies
 is arth main "siddhant" shabd kabhi-kabhi mukhyadhara ke vaigyanik siddhant ke bajaay "atkal" yaa "prakkalpana" ke rup main zyada anaupchaarik mana jaataa he
 Also, the term conspiracy is generally used to refer to powerful faces, often establishments that are believed to deceive a large population, such as political corruption
 Although some conspiracies are not really theories, they are often marked as such by the general public
 "shadyantr ke siddhant" vaakyansh kaa pehla darj upyog 1909 se dikhataa he
 Originally it was a neutral term, but it assumed its present derogatory meaning after the political upheaval in the 1960s
 oxford english dictionari main yah 1997 ke aakhir main poorak ke rup main shaamil hua
 The term "conspiracy theory" has been used repeatedly by scholars and popular cultures to identify secret military, banking, or political actions intended to "take away" power, money, or freedom from "people"
 kam prachlit arth main yah lokkatha or shahari itihaas katha va vividh tarah ke vyaakhyaatmak kism ke cathopakathan ke rup main prayukt hota he, jo puranic kathaon se jude hote hai
 The term is also used in the derogatory sense of automatic dismissal of claims that are ridiculous, nonsensical, insane, baseless, bizarre or irrational
 For example, the term "watergate conspiracy theory" does not have a generally accepted connotation, in which many of the participants were actually convicted of conspiracy and others were pardoned before filing charges, rather its alternative and Additional theories are used to refer to the claim that the information source called "deep throat" was coined

 Leading scholars of conspiratorialism include: Hofstadter, Karl Popper, Michael Barkun, Robert Alan Goldberg, Daniel Pipes, Mark Fenster, Mintz, Carl Sagan, George Johnson, and Gerald Posner
 mintj ke anusaar shadyantrwaad ek sanketak he: "khule itihaas main shadyantron kii pradhanta main vishwaas

 For example, conspiracy theories do not reveal a particular era or type of ideology

 According to Burlett and Lyons, "conspiracyism is a particular narrative form of sacrificial goat, which lures fiendish enemies into a larger internal conspiracy against a generally good deed, while it calls that scapegoat ringing alarm bells Valleys as a hero
 " Conspiracy theories are the subject of widespread criticism by academics, politicians and media

 The term "conspiracy theory" has been termed by various observers to be a fair description of a conspiracy claim, a derogatory term used to dismiss such a claim without examination and to promote such a claim
 This word is also used to indicate positive support by givers
 kuch logon dwaara is shabd kaa prayog vaise tark ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, jin par ve puri tarah vishwaas nahin karte, lekin ise parivartanamoolak or romaanchak maanate hai
 The most widely accepted meaning of the word is that which is in the practice of popular culture and educational usage, and certainly has a negative impact on the potential truthfulness of the speaker
 internet par shadyantr ke siddhant aksar "haashiye par sthit" samooh bataakar khaarij kar diye jate he, lekin saboot se pataa chalata he ki aaj americanyon kaa ek bada hissaa, bhale hi ve kisi bhi jaateey, ling, shiksha, pesha or anya samoohon ke hon- kam se kam kuch shadyantr siddhanton ko vishwasaneey maanate hai
 In view of the popular meaning of the term, they can actually be used illegally and inappropriately as a means of refuting allegations with solid and complete evidence

 Michael Paranti gives an example of the use of the term, which seems conflicting in its own use
 ve likhte hai, The term "conspiracy theory" itself is a type of subject of conspiracy theory, which argues that the term is used to manipulate the audience's disregard for the subject of discussion, either to hide the truth As a deliberate attempt or as a deception of a deliberate conspiracy
 jab shadyantr ke siddhanton ko aadhikarik daavon ke rup main pesh kiya jaataa he, to unhen aam taur par shadyantr ke siddhant ke rup main vichaar nahin kiya jaataa

 Further difficulties arise from the ambiguity of the term theory

 Psychologists believe that the search for meaning is common in the development of conspiracyism and conspiracy theory, and this alone can be so powerful that one can first construct an idea
 Confirmation bias and avoidance of cognitive dissonance can reinforce confidence once cognition occurs

 Some research done at the University of Kent in the UK suggests that people can be influenced by conspiracy theories without knowing that their eyesight has changed

 The authors concluded that conspiracy theories have 'a hidden power' that affects people

 is tarah ke ek gupt dal khud ko aashwast karne kaa ek upkaran hai ki kuch ghatnaayen yadrichhik nahin hai, lekin maanav buddhi ke dwaara aadeshit hai
 This shows that such incidents are comprehensible and potentially controllable

 Some historians argue that conspiracyism has an element of psychological projection
 tark ke mutabik, yah prakshepan sajeesh karne waalon ke liye swayan kii visheshtaon ke avaanchhneeya ropan ke rup main prakat hota he
 Richard Hofstadter wrote in his essay - The Paranoid Style in American Politics - that

 It is possible that some basic human knowledge can be focused on materials with theoretical bias tests
 According to one study, humans apply the "rule of Thumb", through which we hope that a significant event has a significant cause
 yah adhyayan vishyon ke liye ghatnaon ke chaar sanskaran pesh karata he, jisamen ek videshi sanghathan pramukh kii safaltaapurvak hatya kar di gai, ghayal hua, lekin batch gaya, ghaav ke baavjood batch gayi, lekin baad kii taarikh main dil ke daure kii mrityu ho gai or puri tarah batch gayi
 In cases of major incidents, the subjects can point to a potentially suspicious conspiracy - in which the head of the organization was killed - then other evidence available to them should be similar compared to other cases
 The genetic tendency of humans to be associated with paridolia is that it tries to find patterns in coincidence and this allows the "discovery" of a conspiracy in an important event

 However, it can be a valid rule of thumb for detectives to use when a list of suspects is being made for investigation
 Experiment as to who has motive, means and opportunity '- is a perfectly valid use of this rule of thumb

 Christopher Hitchens considers conspiracy theories to be 'the exhaust of the gas of democracy', which is an unavoidable consequence of the large amount of information circulating among the vast majority of people
 anya saamaajik tikaakaron or samajashastriyon kaa kahana he ki shadyantr ke siddhant un vividhtaon se paidaa hote hai, jo ek loktantric samaaj ke bheetar badal sakate he
 Conspiracy incidents can be emotionally satisfying when they are placed in an intuitive and ethical context
 The theory is capable of providing moral responsibility for an emotionally disturbing event for the client or a clearly imagined group of individuals
 mahatvapurn baat he yah ki samooh aastikon ko shaamil nahin karata

 Mark Fenster argues that "just because archaic conspiracy theories are wrong, it does not mean that they cannot do anything wrong
 In particular, they address theoretically real structural injustice, for a shabby civil society
 Give a response and converge towards the ownership of the means of production, which simultaneously recognize the political subject and in the public domain Do without the ability to Ucit

 ek samooh yaa saamaajik str par aitihaasik kaarak santoshjanak arth nirdisht karne kii prakriya ko kam yaa adhik samasyagrast kar sakate hai
 Alternatively, conspiracy theories may arise when the evidence available in the public record does not coincide with the general or official version of events
 Conspiracy theories in this regard can sometimes uncover blind spots in common or official interpretations of events

 If this observation is true then it is to be expected that the viewer both demands and consumes emphasis on this aspect and is more receptive to the dramatic account of personal and social events for himself
 media kii ek duusari, shaayad sambandhit, alankarik bhashaa main nakaaratmak ghatnaon ke liye vyaktigat jimmedaari tay karne kaa prayaas hota he
 There is a tendency in the media that if an incident happens, it starts searching for the culprits and it is so important that it does not remove it from its news agenda within a few days
 With this trend, it has been said that there is no place in the news for the concept of a pure accident
 Again, if this is a correct observation, it may reflect in that actual change in how the media consumer views negative events

 Feature films such as Enemy of the State and Shooters are among the many films that advance conspiracies as a common practice and also abandon the tendency to question conspiracies, which pre-1970 films There was a specialty in the era

 This then suspiciously justifies a happy ending, although the audience expects it, but in fact another effect comes in the form of exaggerating the feeling of false and fictional stories, and in fact it The publicity media justifies losing public confidence in the statement
 vishwaas ke nuksaan se jo shunya paidaa hota he, vah shadyantr ke siddhant ke spashtikaran ko dhwast kar detaa he
 The act of dramatizing real or fictional events also nurtures untrue and deliberate efforts at a level which media experts today can easily identify

 The society in which the creation, distribution, use, integration, etc
 of information has become an important economic, political and cultural activity is called information society
 soochna ke utpaadan, vinimay or upbhog ke ird-gird sangathit samaaj kii is dharna kaa pratipaadan nabbe ke dashak main kiya gaya
 In the mid-seventies, the writings of information society could be heard in Daniel Bell's post-industrial society writings, but only after the explosion of global information technologies such as the Internet in the nineties did this idea develop fully
 soochna or soochna-samaaj kaa rishta kamobesh vaisaa hi he jaisaa udyogon or audyogic yug ke bich he
 The existence of machines, factories and waste labor existed even before the industrial era, but in the nineteenth century their centrality grew in such a way that basic changes in people's lives and their attitudes were made
 soochna, jo hameshaa se maujuud or ahm thi, ek nishchit praudyogikeey avasthaa ke kaaran pichley teen dashak ke dauraan maanav-samaaj kii niamak ban gayi he
 This has led to a distinctive form of social organization in which the basic source of productivity and power lies in the production, processing and transmission of information
 soochna ne sabase keemtee or zaruri panya kaa rup grahan kar liya he
 This does not mean that the importance of a factory-production and service-based economy has disappeared
 arthvyavastha ke ye kshetra apni bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai, lekin audyogic samaaj yaa uttar-audyogic samaaj kii dharanaayen ab parivartan kii mukhya chaalak-shakti nahin rah gayi hai
 Some scholars insist that the phenomenon of the information society should be defined in the light of the all-round rise of information-based markets
 shaareerik shram ke bajaay soochna aadhaarit poonji kahin adhik dhan paidaa kar sakati he
 The number of information-based products has grown rapidly and continues to grow
 1945 main samoochee dharti par jitani computer-power maujuud thi, usase zyaada takat kholte hi sangeet sunaane vaale sirf ek greeting card main maujuud hoti he
 As soon as we open the paper printed on paper in the morning, we become a listener as well as a reader
 hamaari nigaah na keval vigyapanon main darj soochnaaon par padati he, balki kisi-kisi vigyaapan main lage hue ek chote se yantra se aati hui awaz bhi us utpaada kaa prachaar karti hui sunaayi detii he
 Once upon a time, the price of a car was mostly based on the steel it contained, but today more than 70% of the price of a new Toyota car is extracted from its Informatics component
 market-research ke aadhaar par praapt soochnaaon ke aadhaar par upabhokta ke charitra or pravritiyon kii shinaakht kii jaati he jiskaa nirnaayak asar utpaadan sambandhi faisalon par padataa he
 Through the decoding of biological information, the possibilities of science are constantly increasing
 iske nattejey human jinom project main nikle hai
 Cloning and replication of information are synonymous with each other
 soochna praudyogikiyaan bazaaron or samskritiyon kii gatishiltaa or failaav kaa madhyam ban gayi hai
 Nation-states still struggle to occupy and control the territories
 kachche maal va saste shram ke sansadhano ke dohan ke liye samrajyavaadee or nav-aupniveshik abhiyaan aaj bhi chalaaye jate hai
 But the struggle to control information has become much bigger today
 soochna ek aisa pratimaan he jiske madhyam se saamaajik vikaas kii nayi pravritiyon kii vyakhya kii ja sakati he
 The information-based development process has led to ethical concerns related to media, medicine and technology related to surveillance
 soochna ke vitaran, us par adhikaar or lekhakatv kii paribhaashaon se jude prashn lagaataar vivaadaaspad hote ja rahe hai
 These new trends are not only positive
 vichaarkon ke bich soochna ke bolbaale ke kaaran paidaa hui duschintaaon par bhi chintan-manan chal rahaa he
 There is also considerable concern among sociologists regarding the state of knowledge structures in the information society
 soochna-samaaj par bahes kaa dhruvikaran ho gaya he
 One side believes that this form of society has introduced them to new dimensions of freedom
 aise samaaj main log adhik soochna-sampann hone ke naate behatar atmabhivyakti ke yogya honge
 Through new technologies they will get a chance to better participate in political and cultural circles
 yah paksh praudyogiki ke prabhutv main kisi kism kaa jokhim nahin dekhtaa
 On the contrary, the other side is pointing towards a variety of difficulties due to information-abundance and information-priority
 satta sanrachanaayen soochna-praudyogikiyon kaa sahaara le kar vyakti or samaaj kii gatividhiyon kii adhik nigaraanee kar rahi hai jisase niztaa or privesi ant ke kareeb pahunch gayi he
 With the new technology, it is possible to monitor and record continuously
 iske alaava agar hamaari kareed-farokht or ghoomane-phirane se sambandhit jaankariyaan bhi jamaa kii ja rahi hai, to unke aadhaar par bhi hamen ek purv-nirdhaarit kism ke aacharan kii taraf jane-anjaane dhakela ja saktaa he
 This side believes that information society is not independent
 usne tarah-tarah ke vikendrikrut networkon ke madhyam se niyantran kiya ja rahaa he
 The Panopticon's idea that Bentham and Fuko first proposed is fully applicable to the conditions of the information society
 soochna-samaaj ke sabase charchit siddhantkaar manuel kacells hai jinaki rachana da information age : iconomi, socity and culture ne is pratyay ko prachlit kiya he
 Cassell's discussion does not provide a satisfactory answer to the question of what will be the status of the structures of knowledge in the information society
 unhone soochna or gyaan ko jis chintan ke aadhaar par paribhaashit kiya he vah 1962 se 1977 ke bich prakaash main aayaa tha
 Marshall mcluhan's theory of media was also published in the sixties
 is shaastra dwaara di gayi paribhaashaon ke mutabik soochna ke aadhaar par gyaan kii rachana hoti he or soochna ko use utpaadit or prasaarit karne vaali praudyogiki se kaat kar nahin samajha ja saktaa
 As a result the technological situation profoundly affects the structure of knowledge
 agar yah vimarsh sahi he to phir sawaal uthta he ki soochna-praudyogiki main hone vaale kisi achaanak parivartan se soochna-samaaj main gyaan bhi badal jayega? jyaan-fraswan lyotar ne bhi 1979 main prakashit apni rachana postmodern candishan main yah chaunkaa dene vaala avlokan kiya tha ki computarikrut poonjeewaad ke jamaane main gyaan parivartit hue bina nahin rah saktaa
 Lyotar saw at that time that knowledge was becoming an 'informative commodity'
 digitalizeshan ne gyaan ko soochna ke tukdon main badal diya he or un bits ko mashiinon par sansaadhit karke tej rakrataar se prasaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 In this way, information becomes a form of knowledge in Lyotar's eyesight that is designed to be transmitted through the channel so that it can be effective or operational
 is lihaaz se gyaan kaa yah rup chintanaparak na ho kar pradarshanparak or parinammak he
 This is what mcluhan says that information is a non-negotiable code or data that is produced like small sound bytes of TV and which humans continue to consume like machines
 soochna-samaaj main gyaan kii aisi chintajanak sthiti par vichaar karte hue scot lash ne apni rachana critic of information main aakhyaan aadhaarit gyaan or praudyogikeey soochna aadhaarit gyaan main fark kiya he
 According to Lache, narrative-based knowledge demands contemplation and contemplation with patience, while the new form of knowledge disappears the faster it appears
 is lihaaz se lash soochna ko pratinidhitvamoolak maanane ke bajaay prastutimulak maanate hai
 Information is the name of a 'rough factuality'
 uski yah prakruti samaaj or samskruti ke siddhantkaron ke liye kathinaayee pesh karti he
 They have no chance to develop criticism by remaining outside the purview of the information society
 isiilie unhen pehle samskruti or samaaj ko paribhaashit karne vaali buniyadi dharanaon par punarvichaar karnaa hoga
 These assumptions do not prove to be effective within the information society due to the production of statistical knowledge

 caitra shukla pratipada tithi ke thik nave din bhagwaan shriram kaa janm hua tha | aryasamaj kii sthapana isi din hui thi | yah din kalp, sristi, yugadi kaa praarambhik din he | sansarvyapee nirmalata or komalta ke bich prakat hota he hamaara apana nayaa saal * *vikram sanvatsar vikram samvath kaa sambandh hamaare kalchakra se hi nahin, balki hamaare sudeergh sahitya or jivan jeene kii vividhta se bhi he
 Somewhere there is no dust, no soggy mud, purity like mind after bathing the ground and sky everywhere
 pataa nahin kis mahaamanaa rishi ne caitra ke is divya bhav ko samajha hoga or kisaan ko sabase zyada suhaati is chait me hi kaal gananaa kii shuruuaat maani hogi
 The Vedic name of Chaitra month is Madhu month

 This spring comes only in Phalgun, but is fully expressed in Chaitra
