loktantr kii bahuwaadi avadharana kaa vikaas mukhya rup se america main hua
 Among its proponents is S
 M
 Lancet, Robert Dal, V
 Presthes, F
 Hunter etc
 are prominent
 unka tark he ki raajnneetik satta utani saral nahin he jitani dikhaai padati he, yah vibhinn samoohon, sanghathanon, virgon or sanghon samet abhijan varg jo aamtaur par samaaj ko netritv pradaan karata he ke bich banty hui he
 Different selfish groups present their demands directly, but also through various political parties
 bahulwaadi loktantr kii ek paribhaasha is prakaar di gai he
 It is a political system in which policies are determined by mutual consultation and exchange of ideas between different groups because no group or elite is so strong that it can put enough pressure on the government alone to meet all its demands
 Could complete
 bahulwaadi satta kii is saajhedaari kaa anumodan karte hai ki isse laabh yah hota he ki koi bhi saamaajik samooh sarkaar kii niti- nirdhaaran kii prakriya par is kadar haaavee nahin ho paata ki vah anya virgon ke hiton kii andekhi kar sake
 But, there was also a belief of pluralist theorists that all citizens have the legal opportunity and economic resources to organize and pursue their interests in the political arena
 is avasar ke bagaiyr nagarik kisi prastaavit kadam kaa samarthan yaa virodh nahin kar sakate
 Pluralist thinkers consider politics to be a process of determination between groups rather than individuals, and declare that democracy works best only when citizens join groups supporting their special interests
 ve is baat par vishesh bal dete hai ki kisi samaaj main vyaktiyon kii sakriy sahabhaagita honi chahie or apane sankalp ko kriyanvit karne ke liye vibhinn samoohon se jud janaa chahie
 At the same time, all groups and their members must accept that elections are an effective weapon of participation of the larger community in political decisions
 isi tarah, abhijan varg ke saare samooh or sadsy parsparik pratiyogita ke dwaara loktantr ko sambhav banaate hai
 It is clear from this that the pluralistic theory does not really completely oppose elitism because according to its promoters, the existence of elite class is a reality and they are satisfied with its location
 yahi kaaran he ki bahulwaadi siddhanton kabhi-kabhaar abhijanvarg siddhanton se aanshik rup main hi bhinn samajha jaataa he
 The great American political thinker Robert Dal combines his elitist and pluralist notions of democracy and calls his democratic conception as a great system
 uske anusaar, janata samoohon or abhijanvarg ke raajnneetigyon donon ke madhyam se sakriy hoti he
 It has cited many communities that influence the policy making of the government - eg, business houses and industrialists, merchants, labor organizations, farmer organizations, consumers, voters, etc
 aisa nahin he ki unki puri kaarysoochee kriyanvit ho hi jaati he
 Not all groups are equally strong, and many groups are more effective at preventing adversaries than persuading them to have their own preferences
 bahulwaadi sinddhanth ke viruddh uthaai jane vaali aapattiyon main nimnlikhit pramukh hai: Participation in political activity is the core of democracy, but in capitalist democracies, it is often limited to voting in elections
 loktantr kaa sahabhaagita siddhanth sanwarddhit bhagidaari ko ek adarsh bhi maanata he or krutyaatmak aavashyaktaa bhi
 Prominent proponents of this theory include Carole Perlman, CB since the 1960s
 mcpherson and N
 Left-wing thinkers like Paul Jas have been prominent
 sahabhaagi loktantr kii do pramukh visheshtaayen nimnlikhit hai: According to the principles of participatory democracy, if the task of making policy decisions is confined only to the elite, then the real nature of its democracy is disrupted
 isliye ve isamen aam aadmi kii sahabhaagita kii vakaalat karte hai
 They believe that if the democratic rights are confined to the pages of the paper or the articles of the constitution, then those rights have no meaning, hence the actual consumption of those rights by ordinary people is necessary
 lekin yah upbhog bhi tabhi sambhav he jabaki vyakti swatantra or samaan ho
 If people believe that opportunities for effective participation in policy decisions are not really present, then they will definitely become participants
 aisi sthiti main ve prabhavi dhang se saajhedaari bhi kar sakenge
 The democracy in which it is dominated by political or technical or democratic elite, is not satisfactory to the citizens and the people can end the class domination only through participation
 sahabhaagita siddhanth ke samarthakon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki aaj ke audyogic or praudyogic samaajon main shiksha kaa str unchaa ho gaya he or bauddhik tathaa rajnatik chetana se sampann samaaj main abhijan or gaiyr-abhijan ke bich kii khai kam hui he
 Therefore, participation of ordinary people is not a hindrance in most of the cases in terms of efficiency and development
 sach poocha jaae to satta kaa vikirnan hi atyaachaar ke viruddh sabase majboot suraksha-kavach he
 Only a democracy based on participation can protect citizens from neutrality, ignorance and isolation and can fulfill the basic needs of democracy
 prashn he, aam naagarik kii raajnneetik sahabhaagita kaise ho ? iske siddhantakaaron ne iske nimnlikhit tareeke bataae hai: mcpherson remarks that today's nations are vast in terms of region and population, and it is not possible that all citizens are involved in the political discourse or policy-making of the Rosemary, yet if certain conditions are accepted then the participation ratio is certain Can be increased ye sharte hai: David Held objected to the participatory principle, saying that it is better than the archaic / elite pluralist theories, but it is unclear how and why only the higher levels of participatory human development, which is an important goal of democracy, Will be able to achieve is baat kaa koi sakshya athwa tark sangat aadhaar nahin miltaa ki sahabhaagita nagarikon ko saamaanya hit ke prati adhik sahyogshil or patibaddh banaaegi
 Held also does not necessarily hold the central belief that ordinary people want to be more responsible in policy making and decision making on issues affecting their lives
 yadi ve saamaajik-aarthik maamalon or nitiyon ke nirdhaaran main bhaag lenaa nahin chahen to unhen iske liye baadhya karnaa uchit nahin mana ja saktaa
 Nevertheless, if the common people want to take their democratic tendencies beyond a threshold and start to interfere in the matter of basic freedom and rights, then what questions of democracy will happen, the supporters of the participation theory did not pay enough attention to such questions
 is
 cook or morgan ke anusaar sahabhaagi loktantr ko asli jama pehanaanaa utana aasaan nahin he jitna upree taur par prathit hota he
 For example, what should be the size and function of the participating unit, then how will the decisions taken at the local levels on the basis of active participation of citizens be coordinated and integrated with the interest of the entire nation? The policy matters of one local partner unit may be hostile to the other unit as well
 phir ek baat yah bhi he ki adhiktam sambhav sahabhaagita ke bal par liye gaye nirnay aavashyak nahin ki sarvaadhik kargar nirnay hon hi
 Supporters of participatory theory do not pay enough attention to issues of efficiency and effectiveness
 aam dharna ke vipareet loktantr ke vichaar ko marks or pashchavarti marxvaadi vichaarkon ne bhi sweekaar kar liya he
 So much so that their democracy-related conception is completely different from western liberal democratic conceptions
 chunki marxvaadiyon kaa maananaa he ki poonjivadi vyavastha main loktantric adhikaar sahi arth main aam janata ke paas na hokar sirf saadhan-sampann varg ke haath main hota he, isliye ve ek aise loktantr kii sthapana chaahate hai jo ‘janata kaa loktantr‘ ho
 In Marxist democracy, socialist democracy is established after the abolition of ownership over the means of production and controlling the economy by the proletariat
 marks udaaravaadi sanvaidhanik loktantr kaa aalochak tha kyonki uske anusaar poonjivadi loktantr kaa aadhaar ek aisi aarthik pranali hoti he jisamen utpaadan ke saadhan hameshaa puunjipati varg ke niyantran main hote hai
 This bourgeoisie keeps the government and the state system under its power by keeping it under the control of the political system
 rajya satta, adhikaar or visheshadhikaar purnatah usee varg ke paas hote hai or shramikvarg ke paas sirf naam kii swatantraaa or adhikaar hote hai
 The official class of the state, the court and the police force are also not the neutral but seekers of the sovereign class
 isliye, loktantr ek aisi shashan-pranali kaa rup akhriyaar kar letaa he jo shaasha varg kii satta or visheshadhikaar ko badhaava dene or ucch varg ke hiton ko saadhane ke kaam aata he
 In spite of this, Marx and Engels have accepted that even the moderate bourgeois democracy controlled by the thriving bourgeoisie can to some extent make historical claims to give real rights to its citizens and the working class can use it to organize the revolution of the proletariat
 can do
 udaaravaadi loktantron main aam matadhikaar kaa upyog sarvharavarg kii krantikari aandolan kii prishthbhumi taiyaar karne main kiya ja saktaa he
 Marxists certainly believe that violent revolutionary movements may not be required in some situations, but the possibility of such situations is slim
 agar samaajawaadee kranti ke lakshya ko puraa karne ke liye sansadeey maarg apanaaya bhi jaataa he to yah anya prakaar ke sangharshon main ek atirikt sahaayak upkaran hi ho saktaa he
 According to Marxist analysis, real democracy is possible only after the proletarian revolution to uphold the dictatorship of the proletariat, because the ideal of liberal bourgeois democracy can be of participation, but in reality the participation of the resourceless working class is not there
 apni rachana ‘da critic of da gotha program‘ main marks or angels ne apni avadharana ko spasht karte hue likhaa tha ‘poonjivadi or samyavaadee samaaj ke bich main hi ek kaa duusare main roopantaran kii avadhi nihit hoti he
 Corresponding to this is a period of political transition in which the state has distinguished between totalitarianism and communism of the proletariat
 ve ise ek madhyavarti kaal maanate hai
 This results in the establishment of a communist society
 yah samajhnaa jaruri he ki karl marks or angenles ne adhinayakawad pad kaa prayog kis arth main kiya he
 In his view, each state has been the authoritarianism of the ruling social class
 poonjivadi vyavastha main yah varg sampann audyogic or vyapaaree burjua kaa tha jabaki unki apni avadharana vaala rajya kranti ke turant baad sarvhaara ke niyantran vaala rajya hoga or tab samaajawaadee punanirmaan kii prakriya shuru hogi jiskaa ant ek vargaheen samaaj kii sthapana main hoga
 Therefore, in his view, democracy and proletarian totalitarianism will run simultaneously, just as liberal democracy in the capitalist system is practically democracy and also the totalitarian ruler of the bourgeoisie of industrialists and business houses
 isiilie, marks or angels kaa kahana tha ki kranti or shramik varg ke aadhipaty ke pashchaat kii pranali ‘janata ke loktantr‘ kii pranali hogi
 He meant the mass population of the masses in place of a handful of rich bourgeoisie
 marks dwaara pratipaadit ‘janata kaa loktantr‘ kii pramukh visheshtaayen nimnlikhit hai The creation of socialist societies further enhanced Marxist ideas, Lenin who established the first socialist state in Russia in 1917 introduced new interpretations of Marxist thought
 usne sarvhaara ke adhinayakawad ko sweekaar kiya or samaajawaadee kranti ke iske mahatva par bal diya, lekin usne iske saath yah bhi jod diya ki sarvhaara varg kaa adhinayakawad vishaal sarvhaara sanghathan yaa samyavaadee dal dwaara hi prayog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 He described three stages of democracy: capitalist democracy, socialist democracy and communist democracy
 uske anusaar loktantr rajya kaa ek swaroop he or varg-vibhajit samaaj main sarkaar adhinayakawadi or loktantric donon hoti he
 It is democracy for one class and totalitarianism for another
 burjua varg chunki apane hit saadhan main poonjivadi pranali ko niyantrit or sanchalit karata he, isliye use satta se bedakhalkar samaajawaadee loktantr ko sthapit karnaa aavashyak he
 Lenin acknowledges that the newly established socialist state is as oppressive as the capitalist state
 sarvhaara varg ke shashan ko lagu karne ke liye yah aavashyak bhi he
 Since the bourgeoisie is very powerful, it becomes necessary for the proletariat to abolish the capitalist class by force in the early stages of socialist democracy
 sarvhaara ke adhinayakawad ke samaksh do lakshya hote hai: According to Lenin, this task is mainly done by the communist party
 is tarah, lenin kii drushti main poonjivadi loktantr main sachcha loktantr nahin hota, jabaki sarvhaara ke adhinayakawad main purvaapeksh adhik loktantr hota he, kyonki yah bahusankhyak sarvhaara varg kaa shashan he
 He also claimed that eventually democracy would become unnecessary with the realization of true communism, as it would have no meaning in the context of that society
 marks, angels or lenin ke baad anek vichaarkon ne marxvad kii anek vyakhyaayein prastut kii he
 Among them are Edward Bernstein, Karl Cotsky, Rosa Lukjamvarg, etc
 edward bernstin kaa daawa he ki poonjeevaad kii marxvaadi vyakhya galat he or sarvhaara kaa adhinayakawad na to aavashyak he, na vaanchhneeya
 According to him, political democracy and liberal freedoms are more important
 lenin kii yah manyata sahi nahin he ki sarvhaara kaa adhinayakawad aavashyak he
 Bernstein argues that until the proletariat attains majority, socialist revolution is impossible and totalitarianism is no longer needed if it achieves majority
 uske anusaar loktantr aavashyak he or marxvaadi samaajawaadee siddhanth ke saath loktantric parampara ko jodakar hi samaajwaad kii sthapana ho sakati he
 Raising the objection to Lenin's anti-democracy policy, Marxist revolutionary Rosa Luxembourg has said that it establishes totalitarianism over a large population, not the dictatorship of the vast masses
 • bahusankhyak janasamudaay, jo gaiyr-abhijanvarg kaa nirmaayak he, main adhikansh bhavashunya, aalsee or udasin hote hai, isliye ek aisa alpsankhyak varg kaa hona aavashyak he jo netritv pradaan kare
 According to the eligibility principle, expertise is essential for efficiency in today's complex society and the number of experts is always small
 atah rajnatik netritv aise chuninda sakasham logon ke haath main hona aavashyak he
 • Democracy is simply a mechanism by which one of the small groups governs with minimal support from the public
 The elitist theory also believes that the elite classes - political parties, leaders, executives of big business houses, leaders of voluntary organizations and here It is necessary to have a consensus among the labor organizations so that the basic functioning of democracy is determined by non-responsible leaders
 To be saved from
 • sahabhaagita siddhanth ke samarthakon ke anusaar loktantr vaastavik arth prayek vyakti kii samaan sahabhaagita he, na ki maatr sarkaar ko sthaayee banaae rakhana jaisaa ki abhijanvaadee athwa bahulwaadi siddhantkaar maan lete hai
 True democracy can be created only when citizens are politically active and continue to take a keen interest in collective problems
 sakriy sahabhaagita is liye aavashyak he taaki samaaj kii pramukh sansthaaon ke paryaapt vinimay hon or raajnneetik dalon main adhik khulaapan or uttardaayitv ke bhav hon
 • According to the principles of participatory democracy, if the task of making policy decisions is confined only to the elite, then the real nature of its democracy is disrupted
 isliye ve isamen aam aadmi kii sahabhaagita kii vakaalat karte hai
 They believe that if the democratic rights are confined to the pages of the paper or the articles of the constitution, then those rights have no meaning, hence the actual consumption of those rights by ordinary people is necessary
 • loktantr rajya kaa ek swaroop he or varg-vibhajit samaaj main sarkaar adhinayakawadi or loktantric donon hoti he
 It is democracy for one class and totalitarianism for another

 Benioff scripted the character the way Jackman described it in a funny way, but he would have to deviate from some of his features
 isi tarah gambit bhi ek kirdaar tha jise film nirmaataaon ne purvavarti X-main filmon main daalane kii koshish kii thi
 Jackman liked Gambit, as he is a "loose cannon" like Wolverine, referring to the antics of Wolverine and Pyro's contacts in the original trilogy
 David Ayer also contributed to the screenplay
 benioff ne apana praaroop taiyaar kar liya or jaikaman ne kaha ki shooting se pehle isamen ek saal or lagegaa, kyonki 2007 ke dauraan australia kaa filmakan shuru karnaa unke liye nirdhaarit tha

 Jackman saw similarities between the main character and Logan in Hood's previous film Jotsi
 Hood elaborated that, while he was not a fan of the comic book, he "felt that Wolverine's character, his biggest attraction to my site, lies in the fact that he is in some cases one of those, Due to his nature, he himself is full of anxiety and constantly struggles with his nature
 nirdeshak ne film kii theme main woolvarin ke bheetar chal rahe pashavik barbarta or maanviya gunon ke bich antardvand ko ujagar kiya he
 Hood had fun in the previous film, but wanted to show off his feeling by doing something different

 sambandhit janaganana code: rajya code :09 jila code :135 tehsil code : 00721 Districts of Uttar Pradesh vipanan ek satat prakriya he jiske antargat marketing mix kii yojana banaai jaati he evam karyanvayan kiya jaataa he
 This process is done to exchange products, services or ideas between individuals and organizations
 vipanan ko ek rachanaatmak udyog ke rup main dekha jaataa he, jisamen shaamil hai vigyaapan, vitaran or bikri iskaa sambandh graahakon kii bhavi aavashyaktaaon or aakankshaon kaa purv vichaar karne se bhi he, jo praayah bazaar shodh ke madhyam se pataa lagaai jaati hai
 Essentially, marketing is the process of creating or directing an organization so that people can successfully sell the product or service that they not only need but are also willing to buy
 isliye acha vipanan is kaabil hona chahie ki vah upabhoktaaon hetu ek "prastaav" yaa laabhon kaa set bana sake, taaki utpaadon yaa sevaaon ke madhyam se graahak ko uske paise kaa mulya adaa kiya ja sake
 Its specialist areas include: parichay a market-focused or consumer-focused organization first decides what its potential customer wants and then creates a product or service
 jab graahak kisi utpaada yaa seva ko zarurat hone par istemaal karata he yaa use koi kathith laabh hasil hota he, to vipanan siddhant or vyavhaar nyyochit mana jaataa he
 There are two major components of marketing - engaging new customers and expanding existing customers and building relationships with them
 Once the seller makes the incoming buyer their customer, Aadhaar management starts
 aadhaar prabandhan ke tahat jo prakriya armbh hoti he usamen vikreta apane graahak ke saath rishte viksit karata he, sambandhon ko poshan detaa he, die ja rahe phaaydon main izafa karata he or apane utpaada / seva ko nirantar behatar banaata he taaki uskaa vyapaar pratispardhiyon se surakshit rahe
 The success of the marketing plan should reflect the mix of 4 Ps to the demands and needs of consumers or the target market
 Convincing a market segment to buy what they do not need is a very expensive job and rarely successful
 vipanak, aupchaarik or anaupchaarik donon tarah ke vipanan anusandhan se praapt jaankaree par nirbhar karte hai or yah tay karte hai kii graahak kya chahta he or uske liye kitna bhugtan karne kaa icchhuk he
 Marketers hope that this process will give them a sustained competitive advantage
 Marketing management is a practical application for this process
 prastaav bhi 4 Ps siddhant kaa ek mahatvapurn ang he
 According to the American Marketing Association, "marketing is a set of organizational functions and processes by which customers are created, communicated with, and provided with utility and relationships with the consumer to benefit the organization and its stakeholders

 Marketing is a broad and largely interconnected subject from many publications
 yah samay va samskruti ke anusaar khud ko or apni shabdaawalee ko nae tareeke se dubaara gadhane ke liye kukhyat he
 "marketing" is an informative business function that informs and educates the target market about the competitive advantage and price of the company and its products
 mulya vah keemat he jo graahak kisi utpaada kaa maalik banane yaa usko istemaal karne ke liye chukaata he
 "competitive advantage" refers to the fact that both the company or its products are doing something better than their competitors to benefit the consumer
 vipanan kaa centre company tathaa utpaada sambandhi suchanaaen nishchit graahakon tak pahunchane par rahata he

 main vipanan ko un sabhi ranneetiyon evam nirnyon ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he jo nimnlikhit baarah kshetro main tay kiye jate hai: The aim of marketing is to create and maintain priority in the target markets for the company and its products
 The intention of any business is to build mutually beneficial and stable relationships with its customers
 Although all areas of business are responsible for achieving this goal, marketing has the highest responsibility
 isaki paribhaasha ko bade daayre main dekha jaae to vipanan kaary teen vishyon ke samanvay se hota he: "utpaada vipanan ", "korporate vipanan " or, "vipanan sanchaar " 
 Strategic Marketing: An attempt to determine how an organization competes with its competitors in the market
 In particular, it aims to take a profitable edge relative to its competitors
 parichaalan sambandhi vipanan: graahakon ko aakarshith karnaa va unhen banaaye rakhana he or unke liye adhik se adhik upyogi hona he
 Simultaneously, to satisfy the customer by prompt services and to meet his expectations
 parichaalan sambandhi vipanan main shaamil hai porter ke paanch balon kaa nirdhaaran In the early 1960s, Professor Neil Borden identified the company's actions at Harvard Business School that could influence a customer's decision to purchase products or services
 borden ne yah sujhaayaa ki company dwaara uthaaye jane vaale ve sabhi kadam "vipanan mishran" hai
 Professor E
 Jerome mccarthy, also from Harvard Business School, suggested in the early 1960s that the marketing mix consisted of 4 elements: product, price, place, and promotion
 aam chalan main "vipanan" utpaada kaa prachaar he, visheshkar vigyaapan or branding kintu, vyavsaayik upyog main iskaa arth vishad he jiskaa matlab he kii vipanan graahak-kendrit he
 Products are developed to meet the needs of a group of customers or in some cases certain customers
 i
jerome maikaarthi ne vipanan ko chaar saamaanya gatividhiyon ke samoohon main baanta
 unki tipology ko duniya bhar main itani manyata hasil hui kii unke "chaar P" bhashaa kaa hissaa ban gaye hai
 These four Ps are: ye chaar tatv vipanan mishran, ke taur par jane jate hanjinaka upyog ek vikreta vipanan yojana banane ke liye karata he
 The four p model is most useful in marketing low-cost consumer products
 audyogic utpaadon, sevaaon, ucch mulya ke upabhokta utpaadon ke maamle main is model main samaayojan karnaa padataa he
 Service marketing should be for unmatched services
 Industrial or B2B marketing should be for long-term contracts that are specialized in supply chain matters
 In relationship marketing, marketing is seen in the context of long-term relationships rather than personal behavior
 iske viruddh morgan ne rayeeding da vevs of change, main sujhaayaa ki 4 Ps drushtikon kii ek sabase badi khami yah he kii "yah anjaane main hi bheetar kii ore jor detaa he, jabaki vipanan kaa saar baahar ko ore hona chahie"
 phir bhi 4 Ps vipanan kaary kii pramukh shreniyon hetu ek yaad rahane evam kaam karne yogya maargdarshika va dhaanche ke taur par madadgaar hai jiske tahat inhen istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 In addition to the already existing four Ps, three additional titles have been added to the marketing of services called the Extended Marketing Mix
 ye hai: a brand is a name, word, design, symbol, or any other feature that distinguishes a product or service from a competitor's offer
 ek brands kisi sanghathan, utpaada yaa seva ke prati upabhokta ke anubhav kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 a brand is also defined as an identifiable entity that promises a specific value
 sah - branding main vipanan gatividhiyaan shaamil hoti hai jisamen do yaa adhik utpaada hote hai
 Pricing refers to the money that is given in exchange for a product
 yah mulya vastu kii upyogita se nirdhaarit hota he kii graahak uske badale main kitne paise or / yaa balidaan dene ko taiyaar he
 Marketing communication creates marketing messages for different categories according to strategy and transmits them to the target
 ajanabiyon ko graahak main parivartit karne ke pruthak charan hote hai jo istemaal kiye jane vaale sanchaar madhyam ko niyantrit karte hai
 An oral presentation by a salesman who approaches an individual or group of potential customers: utpaada kii kharid ko badhaava dene hetu alpakaalik incentive An example of this is a coupon or a sale
 People are encouraged to buy, but this does not build customer confidence nor encourage them to buy again in the future
 vikray vruddhi kii ek badi khami yah he ki pratidwandiyon dwaara ise aasaani se copy kiya ja saktaa he
 Using it, your product cannot always be distinguished from others
 aajkal kai companiyaan apane graahakon par dhyaan kendrit karti hai
 This means that the activities and products of companies are according to the demand of the customers
 aam taur par yah teen tareekon se kiya jaataa he: graahak chaalit drushtikon, bazaar main parivartan ko pahchaanane ki samaj or utpaada ko abhinav banane kaa drushtikon
 Under a consumer driven approach, consumer demands determine strategic marketing decisions
 koi bhi ranneeti tab tak nahin apanaai jaati jab tak kii vah upabhokta anusandhan pareekshan main safal na ho jaae
 ek utpaada kaa har pahalu, jisamen utpaada kii prakruti bhi shaamil he, vah bhavi upabhokta kii zaruuraton se sanchalit hota he
 The starting point is always the consumer
 iske peeche taarkik pahalu yah he kii anusandhan evam vikaas kosh aise utpaada ko taiyaar karne main nahin kharch karnaa chahie jise log khareednaa na chahen
 itihaas gavaah he kii kai utpaada praudyogiki kii anokhi misaal hone ke baavjood bazaar main nahin chale
 The formal approach to this customer-centric marketing is known as SIVA
 In this system, the four Ps have been given new names and new words to focus on the customer
 SIVA model maang / graahak kendrit sanskaran pradaan karata he, jo vipanan prabandhan ke mashhoor 4ps aapurti vaale model kaa vikalp he
 The SIVA model has four elements: is model kaa prastaav checkiton dev or don shultaj ne marketing management jarnal of da american marketing association main diya tha or unhone market leader - da jarnal of da marketing socity in da UK main prastut kiya tha
 This model focuses primarily on the customer navtpaada drushtikon main, company utpaada navachaar kaa anusaran karti he, phir us utpaada hetu bazaar viksit karti he
 Product innovation drives the process and marketing research is done to determine if a profitable market segment exists for that new product
 tark yah he kii shaayad graahakon ko nahin maaloom kii bhavishya main unke paas kya vikalp maujuud honge to hamen yah ummid nahin kerani chahie kii ve hamako bataaen kii ve bhavishya main kya kharidenge
 tathaapi, vipanak aakraamak tareeke se utpaada navachaar ko apana sakate hai or uskaa laabh uthaa sakate hai
 While following the product innovation approach, marketers should decide that they have different and diverse product innovation approaches
 It is claimed that if Thomas Edison relied on marketing research, he would have made larger size wax lights instead of inventing electric bulbs
 Many companies, such as research and development focused companies, successfully focus on product innovation that constantly changes the way VDO games are played)
 Many purity devotees doubt whether this is really a kind of marketing orientation, as the status of consumer research comes later

 Bayer designation wiring is a way of giving the name that called the phi 1 and the Greek name of the constellation of stars in any constellation
 bair naamon main taramandal ke unani naam kaa sambandh rup2 istemaal hota he
 For example, three of the stars in the Parnin Ash constellation are named - α pagosae, β pagaceae and γ pagaceae
 german khagolashastri yohan bair ne san 1603 main bair namakan shuru kiya
 He tried his best to nominate the stars according to his power of light, but it was very difficult to measure the light at that time and there are many constellations in which the star named alpha is not the brightest star of that planet Happen
 unani varnmaala main sirf choubees akshar hai, jabaki bahut se taramandalon main to pachaas se bhi adhik taare hote hai
 In this case, the lowercase letters of the English alphabet are used after the last letter of Greek
 is vidhi main pachaasave taare kaa naam "z" hoga
 If there are more than fifty stars, then the English letters begin to be used with fifty-one stars
 is tarah se puure 76 taron ko naam die ja sakate hai
 When a material is cooled to 0 ° k its resistance exhibits absolutely zero resistivity
 unke is gun ko atichaalakata kehete hai
 In addition to zero resistivity, in the case of superconductivity, the magnetic field within the material also becomes zero, which is known as the Mesnar effect
 suvidit he ki dhatvik chaalkon kii pratirohakata unka taap ghataane par ghatati jaati he
 But in normal conductors such as copper and silver etc
, the impurities and other imperfections do not decrease the resistivity after a limit
 yahan tak ki tanba param shunya taap par bhi ashoonya pratirohakata pradarshit karata he
 In contrast, when the temperature of the superconducting material is reduced below the critical temperature, its resistivity rapidly decreases to zero
 atichaalak taar se bane hue kisi band paripath kii vidyut dhara kisi vidyut strot ke bina sadaa ke liye sthir rah sakati he
 Superconductivity is a quantum-mechanical view
 atichaalak padaarth chumbakeey parilakshan kaa bhi prabhaav pradarshit karte hai
 They all have zero electric force and the Tomson-coefficient is equal
 sankraman taap par inaki vishisht ushma main bhi aksmaat parivartan ho jaataa he
 It is particularly noteworthy that atoms that have 5 or 7 external electrons have the highest transition heat and the properties of superconductivity are also excellent
 1) bahut adhik chumbakeey kshetra tivrata vaale chumbak banane ke liye atichaalak taron kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 These are called superconducting magnets
 inkaa upyog kan twarakon main hota he
 2) In future they can be used in making smaller and more efficient transformers, motors, electric generators, etc
 3) atichaalkon kaa upyog squid inkaa upyog urja ke bhandaran ke liye kiya ja sakegaa kyonki kisi atichaalak loop main ek baar dhara sthapit karke chhod dene par vah anant kaal tak chalati rahegi
 5) It can be used in magnetic lavitation
 6) inke atirikt atichaalak transmishan line, vidyutchumbak, radio-aavriti cavity, atichaalak transistor, atichaalak electron-punj lens, atichaalak bearing, bolometre, aadi main bhi atichaalakata kaa prayog ho rahaa he
 When a metal is taken in a suitable shape, such as a cylinder or wire, it must produce some resistance to the flow of electricity
 kintu sarvapratham san 1911 main keserling ones ne ek sansaneepurn khoj kii ki yadi paare ko 4 degree ke neeche thandha kar diya jaae to uskaa vidyutiya pratirodh aksmaat nasht hokar vah purna suchalak ban jaataa he
 This property is found in about 20 metals, including ranga, mercury, lead, etc
 jis taap ke neeche yah dasha praapt hoti he us taap ko sankraman taap kehete hai or is dasha kii chaalakata ko atichaalakata
 Transition temperatures are not only different for different metals, but also different for different isotopes of the same metal
 paladium antimony jaise kai mishra dhaatuon main bhi atichaalakata gun paaya jaataa he
 The electrons in the atom revolve in the elliptical path and in this view they act like magnets
 bahari chumbakeey kshetra se in chumbakon kaa aghurna kam ho jaataa he
 In other words, atoms show heterogeneous magnetic effects
 yadi taap tas kisi padaarth ko upyukt chumbakeey kshetra main rakhaa jaae to us suchalak kaa aantarik chumbakeey kshetra nasht ho jaataa he, arthath vah ek visham chumbakeey padaarth jaisaa kaary karne lagata he
 Due to the currents flowing on the surface, the value of the internal field remains zero
 ise mikenor kaa prabhaav kehete hai
 If the superconducting material is placed in a slowly increasing magnetic field, then at a particular value of the field, called the sill value, its resistance again becomes equal to its former value
 atichaalakata ke siddhant ko samajhane ke liye kai suzav die gaye hai
 But most of them have had only partial success

 Is the principle
 iske anusaar atichaalakata chaalak electronon ke yugman se utpann hoti he
 This coupling is caused by the attractive force between the electrons

 Jehovah is the name of God in Judaism and in Hebrew

 note karen ki yahudiyon kii dharmabhasha ibrani kii lipi ibrani lipi main kaval vyanjan likhe ja sakate hai or hrasv swar to bilkul hi nahin
 So the word is made up of four consonants: י ה ו ה, or יהוה, ie yah-ha-wah
 isamen log vibhinn swar ghusaakar ise vibhina uccharan dete hai, jaise yahova, yahaveh, yahaveh, jehova, aadi 
 The Jews considered it useless to take the name of God as a sin, so this word was rarely spoken
 zyaada mashhoor shabd tha "adonai" 
 In the Old Testament / Hebrew Scriptures, the words "L" and "elohim" are also used for God, but strangely, the Jews say that they believe in one God, but the word "elohim" is euphemistic
