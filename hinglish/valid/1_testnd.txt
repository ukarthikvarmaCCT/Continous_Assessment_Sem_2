 The year was 1936 and Babuji's age was 28 years
 The British were trying unitedly to defeat the Congress in Bihar
 He made a fruitless effort to form a puppet government under the leadership of Mohammad Yunus
 Babuji and 14 other members of the Indian Depressed Classes Association were elected in these elections
 Due to the growing political power and popularity of Babuji, the British spoke to support him in return for a large amount, which Babuji immediately turned down without delaying even a moment
 As soon as this incident was known, Gandhiji's faith in Babuji increased more and he said the following lines for Babuji - 'jagjivan Ram is as true and true as Tape Kanchan
 My heart is supplied with respectful admiration for them ' The game of puppet government was over and Congress formed the government
 Babuji was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, Cooperative Industries and Rural Development in this government
 In 1938, on the issue of Andaman prisoners and the use of Indian soldiers by the British government in World War II, Mahatma Gandhi was extremely angry and on one call, all the Congress governments resigned
 After this, Gandhiji started his famous movement 'quit India Movement' from 9 August 1942
 Started on He entrusted Babuji in Bihar and North East India to promote this movement rapidly, which Babuji played in a wonderful manner
 But Babuji was arrested after ten days of campaigning
 After his release in 1943, Babuji pushed for the liberation of India

 This was his favorite subject from the very beginning because Babuji, who grew up in the soil of Chandwa, was born to a farm laborer, where he has personally faced those peculiar conditions and he was also aware of the condition of mill workers in Calcutta
 As Labor Minister, Babuji took the important decision to implement some important laws, tested by time
 These laws are seen as the greatest hope of the working class and the biggest weapon in today's era
 These laws were as follows - 1
 Industrial Disputes Act, 19472
 Minimum Wages Act, 19483
 Indian Trade Union Act, 19604
 Payment of Bonus Act, 1965  do ati aavashyak kanoon jinke bina aaj kaa vyapaarik jivan ast vyast ho jaataa -5

 At that time the aviation department was also included in the Ministry of Communications
 Babuji took steps towards nationalization of private airlines
 As a result, Air Force Corporation, Air India and Indian Airlines were established
 Due to strong opposition to this nationalization scheme, Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel also stood in favor of postponing it
 But on Babuji's persuasion, he agreed and the protest was almost over
 He also talked about laying a network of post offices in villages and started the challenging task of expanding the network
 Dr
 Rajendra Prasad, the first President of the year of India, described this hard work of Babuji in this way - 'babu Jagjivan Ram is a determination worker, At the same time, he has not lagged behind anyone in renunciation
 They have the same enthusiasm and passion of the religious leaders

 But Babuji resigned under the Kamaraj Yojana and started strengthening the Congress Party
 In the general elections of 1966-67, the victorious Babu Jagjivan Ram was once again given the Ministry of Labor in that government
 But after one year, he was given the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food
 After the war with China and Pakistan, conditions of poverty and hunger had arisen in India and PL from USA
 Wheat and sorghum found under 480 were the main source of food supply
 In such a difficult situation, Babuji laid the foundation of Green Revolution with the help of Dr
 Norman Borlaug and after only two years India became a food surplus country
 While in the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, Babuji also brought relief to the country from the severe floods and made India self-sufficient in food resources
 Babuji once again won in the 1970 general elections and this time under Mrs
 Indira Gandhi's government, Ministry of Defense For example, the Ministry of Economy got a chance to provide its services
 Babuji first changed the political map of India completely
 In that unprecedented battle between India and Pakistan, Babuji promised the people of the country that this war will not be fought even on the equal part of the tip of a land of India
 And they stay on this promise
 For this great service of his, Shri Rajiv Gandhi has expressed his views in this way - 'babuji's contribution in liberating the nation has been very commendable
 His contribution in making the country self-dependent in terms of food grains and the liberation war of Bangladesh will always be remembered
 'in 1974, Babuji took responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Irrigation and laid the foundation of a new system' Public Distribution System 'by which It was ensured that the general public of the country had food items available in sufficient quantity and at low prices

 govindpur se is bazaar kii duri lagbhag 3 kilo meter he
 On one side are the Sakri river and on the other side there are long ranges of mountains
 yahan kii jansankhya lagbhag 2000 he
 Most of the population here is dependent on agriculture
 yahaan kii mitti bahut hi upjau he
 Along with money and wheat, vegetables and lentils are also cultivated here
 yahan khet chote chote hai isliye yahan paramparaagat kheti hoti he
 The main market here is Govindpur
 kharidari or bikri ke liye yahan ke log govindpur bazaar hi jate hai
 Just as all the places, whether it is a village or a city, all of them have a history of settling or settling, in the same way there is a history of the formation of Delhua
 delhua kaa itihaas swargeey chetu ram ji kii jubaani xxrep 6 
 It is about those days when it was almost 10 years since India was liberated, the celebration of independence was still in the hearts of the people
 us samay delhua kaa astitv na ke baraabar tha
 As it is believed, in the old times, any city or village, they were settled on the banks of the river so that many needs were met by the river, in the same way, the village of Delhua was also situated on the banks of the Sakri river
 gaavan ke naam par 7 se 8 fush kii jhopadiyaan thi
 At that time the farm was the only means of living
 sakari nadi us samay bhi aise hi bahati thi jaise kii vartmaan main bah rahi he
 The soil along the banks of the Sakri river was very fertile earlier and still is today, so at that time it used to be an edible crop
 kaaphi saalon tak jindagi basar aise hi hota rahaa
 At that time, it would have been life only to get food for two times
 dur dur tak viraan or jangal hi dikhaai dete the
 There was no village far and wide
 us samay shahar ke naam par sirf navada hota tha jahaan janaa aasaan nahin tha
 And why should you go, because no one had the money to go to the cities, and no one had it, but if the need was too much, the people used to go on foot
 gaavan se jane or waapas aane main do din tak kaa samay lag jaataa tha
 Sakri river was a rainy river like before
 har saal barsaat main baadh aana tay tha parantu gaanv ke logo ko isse phayda nuksaan donon hota tha
 In this flood, timber trees were swept away and they were collected and used for the whole year
 nuksaan ye tha kii nadi fashlein bhi bahaakar le jaati thi or jahrile saanp chhod jaati thi
 This was happening every year
 us saal bhi barsaati raat thi sakari nadi main baadh aayaa hua tha
 The water level had reached the maximum limit and now it had to be reduced as was happening every year
 par is saal nadi kaa mizaaj kuch badla-badla sa lag rahaa tha
 The water level was increasing instead of decreasing
 gaanv ke sabhi logon kii bechaini badhati ja rahi thi
 But this time this river was not going to stop, the water level was increasing more
 ab is gaanv main log zyada deree tak nahin ruk sakate the
 Because the water had now come into the houses as well
 kuch hi samay main traahi traahi machane lagi
 The noise started increasing
 bhagdad machane lagi
 Because there was only a short time in the drowning of the village, all of which could be tied in a bundle and started walking from there
 lagbhag aadhe ghante main sabhi rote bilakhte delhua pahari kii talahati main ruke or vahi raat gujaarne kaa faisla liya
 The children who brought the remaining food were fed to the children
 sabhi log sari raat jaagate rahe or bhagwaan se manaate rahe kii hamaara ghar sahi salaamat ho
 As soon as dawn, all eyes were on their homes, which had now stopped appearing
 sabhi bhaage bhaage us jagah gaye jahaan delhua gaanv tha, sabaki ankhen nam thi kyon kii sabhi ghar us bhayankar baadh main bah chuke the
 There were signs of just being home
 or usame bhi jahrile sanpon ne apana baseraa bana liya tha
 Now everything was over
 kuch dinon tak sabhi apane ujde hue gaanv kii yaad ke sahare delhua pahari kii talahati main hi rahane lage
 But now everyone could not live in this way, some decision had to be made whether the village of Delhua should be resettled in the same place as it was before or somewhere else where the river water could not reach
 The most sought opinion
 kuch log is paksh main the kii gaanv yahi basaaya jaae or kuch log duusare paksh main, kaaphi nonk jhonk ke baad ye faisla liya gaya kii gaanv yahan basaanaa sahi nahin rahegaa, phir agle saal isi tarah tabah ho jayega
 Now, where was Delhua to be located, some people were given the task of finding a new place
 jahaan abhi delhua gaanv he vahaan us samay khatarnaak jangal tha
 In which all kinds of wild animals lived from lions
 shaam tak wo sabhi log jo jagah dhundne gaye the wo waapas aa gaye or unhone bataaya kii yahan se ek kosh kii duri par bich jangal main ek samtal ilaaka he nishaani ke taur par vahaan ek purana karam kaa ped he jo kaaphi bada he
 There are bushes of wild thorns, if we clean them then we can build a house for our living there
 vahaan pani kii bhi suvidha he, lagata he bich jangal main koi talab he to usee se pani bah rahaa hoga
 There is a danger of wild animals but the water of Sakri river will not come there
 agali subah sabhi log us jagah ke liye ravaanaa hue
 us jagah ko gaanv ke adhiktar logon ne nahin dekha tha kyon kii us samay jansankhya kam hone ke kaaran jalaavan ke liye lakadiyaan paas main hi mil jaati thi
 After about 2 to 3 hours of trouble, after removing the wild thorns, he reached the same Karam tree
 There was dense forest all around
 deree na karte hue log aas paas ke junglee jhaadiyon ko saaf karne lage, ab itani jagah saaf ho chuki thi kii sabhi apni apni jhopadi bana sakate the
 By cutting the wood of the forest, using palm and banana addresses, all the people set up huts for their living
 andheraa ho chukaa tha
 Sleeping in a new and dangerous place was not easy for everyone
 jaise taise kaaphi logon ne dar ke saae main raat jagakar hi guzaara
 yahan se nae delhua ke banane kii shuruyaat ho chuki thi
 Time passed and the place which was a stranger to everyone was now starting to feel its own
 dhire dhire aas paas ke jangal or saaf hote gaye
 Now Delhua village was looking bigger and prettier than before
 log apni ghar kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye or ghaney jangalon se lakadiyaan laane lage
 Delhua started developing from here
 delhua gaanv main us samay kaaphi tarah ke log the koi mehnatee to koi budhimaan to koi balavaan, unhi logon main se ek the shri chetu ram ji, jo budhimaan hone ke saath saath ek swatantraaa senaanee bhi the
 unki baton main ek dam tha
 jo wo kehete the gaanv ke log maanate bhi the
 unka rutaba gaavan main aadar ke yogya tha
 jab sakari nadi kii baadh main puraane delhua kaa ant hua or nae delhua kii shuruyaat hui to us samay gaanv ke logon ke saamne mukhya samasya khaane kii thi
 baadh main sab kuch bah chukaa tha, khaane ke liye junglee ber ke alaava kuch bhi nahin tha
 us samay yahi shri chetu ram ji paidal navada jila gaye the or ek din baad vahaan se colector ke aadesh se bail gaadi par anaaj ladwakar le the
 usee anaaj ke balboote delhua phir se khadaa hua or aaj yahan tak panhucha
 Diwali, Durgapuja, Holi, Chhath etc
 are among the popular festivals
 durga puja yahan ke logon ke liye sabase khaash he kyonki sarkanda panchayat main delhua hi ek gaanv he jahaan mela lagata he
 People from all the nearby villages come here to see the fair and also do shopping
 is gaanv ko do sadaken navada shahar se jodatii hai
 One way by buckling and the other by roaring
 The first way is to walk the river on foot
 vaise to yahaan kai mandir hai par shiv mandir yahaan kaa bahut prashiddh he
 This temple is on the top of Murali mountain
 yahaan har shanivaar ko bade dhooma dham se puja kii jaati he
 There is a big puja here on Shivratri
 holikaa dahan isi mandir ke paas hota he
 This temple is the pride of Delhua village
 puraani manyata he ki

 Even today there is a habitat of birds under the stones of this hill

 The Bhuvanakosh mentioned in the Devi Bhagpanpancham wing literally follows the subject presented in the fifth wing of Srimad Bhagwat
 shribhagwat main bharatvarsh kii mahima ke pratipadak aathon shloke devi bhagwat main aksharsh: usee kram main uddhrut hai 
 The difference in the descriptions of the two is so much that where the Srimad Bhagavat takes a natural medium of prose for the sake of the description of the subject, Devi Bhagwat uses the artificial medium of the verse to demonstrate the uniqueness
 shrimadbhagwat bhakthiras tathaa aadhyatmagyaan kaa samanvay upasthit karata he
 The Bhagavata is considered to be the self-sufficiency of Nigamakalpataru, which has been made amritamay by the natural brahmachari and the great scientist Maharishi Shuk, combined with his melodious speech

 bhagwat main dakshin desh ke vaishnav tirthon, nadiyon tathaa parvaton ke vishisht sanket hone se katipay vidvan tamildesh ko iske udai kaa sthaan maanate hai
 There is a substantial difference in the subject of time also

 Shankaracharya's grandfather Guru Gaudapadacharya has quoted two verses of Bhagavat in his 'panchakaranavyakhya', 'jagruhe Paurusam Rupam' and 'shrey: Srutiin Bhakti Mudasya te Vibho' in 'uttaragita Tika'
 isse bhagwat kii rachana saptam shatee se arvachin nahin maani ja sakati
 The following table gives the composition of Bhagavata Purana suggested by some scholars- bhagwat kaa prabhaav madhyayugiya vaishnav sampradaayon ke udai main nitant kriyasheel tha tathaa bharat kii prantiy bhashaaon ke krishna kaavyon ke utthan main vishesh mahatvashaalee tha
 Ashtaghapi, Nimbarki, Radhavallabhi poets of Braj Bhasha took radiance and inspiration from Bhagwat, singing Radha Krishna's leelas in Brajbhasha
 mithila ke vidyapati, bengal ke chandidas, gyaandas tathaa govinddas, assam ke shankardev tathaa madhavdev, utkal ke upendra bhanj tathaa dinkrishnadas, maharashtra ke namdev tathaa madhav pandit, gujarat ke narsi mehta tathaa rajasthan kii mirabai - in sabhi santon tathaa kaviyon ne bhagwat ke rasmay varnan se prerana praapt kar radhakrishna kii kamaneey keli kaa gayan apane vibhinn kaavyon main kiya he
 The influence of Bhagwat on the Vaishnava poets of Tamil, Andhra, Kannada and Malayalam is also less
 bhagwat kaa aadhyatmik drushtikon advaitvaad kaa he tathaa sadhanadrushti bhakthi kii he
 Thus the symmetry of devotion with Advaita is Bhagavata's own peculiarity
 inhen kaarnon se bhagwat valmikiy ramayana tathaa mahabharat ke saath sanskrit kii 'upjivy' kavyatrayee ke antarbhoot mana jaataa he
 Bhagwat has 18 thousand verses, 335 chapters and 12 wings

 But the tenth Skandha is the heart of Bhagwat, giving a detailed account of the fine pastimes of Lord Krishna

 Teams of two to five climbers are tied equally spaced in a rope
 agar ek parvatarohi girane lagata he to anya sabhi apane sthaan par sthir ho jate hai or sabaki shakti use girane se roak leti he
 Other team members take out the fallen partner from the crack
 jami barf par surakshit yatra ke liye kai vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 If the climb is tough
 parantu utani sidhi nahin, to arohi barf kii keel gaad kar unamem rassi laga kar apni suraksha karata he
 Each ascending climbs using the same nail anchors and takes out the last ascending anchor
 kabhi kabhi bollard yaa himalambon kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 This is very useful in that case when all the teams start falling together
 This technique is known as simul-climbing and is sometimes used on steep ice and easy rock
 yadi chadhaai atyant kathin or khadi ho to maanak takanic hi upyukt rahati he
 In this, everyone climbs one by one and after reaching one place, he waits for the follower
 sabhi ke ek jagah ekatrit hone ke baad hi kafila aage badhata he
 Climbers use different shelters depending on the circumstances
 pahaado main mausam bahut apratyaashit ho saktaa he isliye aashray parvatarohi ke liye suraksha kaa bahut mahatvapurn pahalu he
 High mountains may require camping for several days
 "aadhaar shivi" kaa istemaal shikhar par jane ke prayaas ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Base camps are built in places protected from the difficult conditions above
 kai lokapriy yaa khatarnaak pahaado par aadhaar shivi sthit hai
 Where the summit cannot be reached in a single day, more than one base camp is made
 udhaaharan ke liye, everest ke dakshin-purv rij vaale raste main aadhaar shivi ke alawa 4 anya shivi bhi maujuud hai
 There is a network of mountain huts, especially in the European Alpine regions
 france main inhen refuges, italy main rifugi, switzraland main kabanes, germany or austria main hatin, slovenia main coca, spain main refugios, tathaa norge main hitt ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Such huts are present at many different elevations, including high mountains, although more remote shelters exist in more remote areas
 parvatiy jhopadiyaan vibhinn aakaar or kismon kii hoti hai, lekin prayek main aam taur par ek saamaajik bhojan kaksh hota he or unamem gadde, kambal yaa duwaits tathaa takie se las sone kii suvidhaayen hoti hai
 Guests are expected to bring their own beds
 The facilities are usually basic, but in such a difficult environment they provide the most important shelter
 iske atirikt ve margon ko adhik vyapak rup se sulabh banane kaa kaam bhi karti hai kyonki arohi yahan ruk kar yatra main vishram kar pate hai tathaa baari upkaran uthaane se bhi unhen chhutkaaraa mil jaataa he
 Hence, they are considered to be an invaluable place in mountaineering
 europe main sabhi jhopadiyon main garmi ke mausam ke dauraan karmchaaree upasthit rahete hai or kuch main vasant ritu main bhi
 anya sthanon par yah patjhad main bhi jhopadiyaan khuli mil jaati hai
 In some huts a part is always open
 yah maanav rahit hoti hai or inhen winter hat kehete hai
 These huts are run by paid employees when they are open, although some of them are also run by voluntary employees who are members of Alpine clubs such as the Swiss Alpine Club and the Club Alpine Française
 The managers of the hut, called guardians or wardens in Europe, also usually serve refreshments and food
 yah suvidha raat bhar rukne waalon tathaa keval din main rahane vaale, donon ke liye uplabdh hoti he
 Given that most of the items, including water, are often brought by helicopter, the food is quite elaborate
 isamen glucose yukt aahaar, vahin banaayi gayi kek tathaa pastery, bear or sharaab sahit garm or thande peya or raatri bhoj ke liye ucch carbohydrate yukt aahaar sammilit hai
 Not all huts however provide this facility, and some have to make their own arrangements
 udhar kuch jhopadiyaan donon prakaar kii suvidhaayen pradaan karatin hai
 Visitors can use their food items and cooking equipment to keep expenses down, or cooked food is also available for those who spend more
 raat bhar ke liye aarakshan anivaary samajha jaataa he, tathaa kuch lokapriy sthanon par to yah aavashyak bhi hota he kyonki achche mausam yaa saptahanth par 100 bistar vaali suvidhaayen bhi bhar jaati hai! ek baar kiye gaye aarakshan ko radd karwaanaa shisht mana jaataa he, kyonki in jhopadiyon ke karmchaaree bade parishram se har arohi ke raste evam chadhaai ke plan kaa ricard rakhte hai taaki arohi kii suraksha sunishchit kii ja sake
 sab jhopadiyon main telephone dwaara sampark kiya ja saktaa he tathaa sabamein bhugtan ke liye credit card sweekaar kiye jate hai
 In the context of mountaineering, a halt or bivy is a resting or sleeping temporary arrangement, in which the climber gets less than the full facilities of stay, eating and equipment available in the traditional place of camping
 isamen keval ek sleeping bag or padaav kii bori lenaa or sona bhi shaamil ho saktaa he
 Sometimes small partial shelter areas such as glacial crevices, rock erosions, and snow ditches are used to protect against wind
 in takneekon kaa prayog asal main apatkaal main kiya jaataa tha; yadhyapi jab barfili gufaaon kaa nirmaan karne ke liye samay or upyukt barf sthiti uplabdh na ho, to kuch parvatarohi padaav ke liye vishesh yojana ke rup main lagaataar alpine style kii ore samarpit rahete hai taaki tamboo kaa vajan batch sake
 in padaavon se sambandhit mukhya jokhim, adhik maatra main thand kii chapet main aane kaa rahata he
 Tents are the most commonly used shelters in the mountains
 ye saadhaaran tarplin ke tukdon se lekar atyadhik baari dijin vaale ho sakate hai jo parvat kii dushkar paristhitiyon se bachane main madad karte hai
 In the event of exposure, it may be necessary to place the tent behind snow or rock
 tamboo lagane kaa ek khatra yah he ki tej hawaaen or baari barfabaari khatarnaak ho sakati he or is kaaran se tamboo karaab hokar tut saktaa he
 In addition, the continuous flutter of the tent cloth can disrupt sleep and increase the fear of shelter safety
 ek tamboo kaa chayan karte samay, arohi vishesh parvatarohan tenton par bharosa karte hai jo vishesh rup se tej hawaaon or bhari barfabaari ko jhelane ke liye banaaye jate hai
 Tent pegs can also be pressed into the snow for extra protection
 
 Where conditions are favorable, ice caves are also another way of shelter on the mountain
 kai parvatarohi bahut oonchaai par tab tak tent kaa prayog nahin karte hai jabatak barf kii sthiti barf kii gupha main rahane kii ajna detii he, kyonki barf kii gufaaen tent kii tulana main kaaphi zyada garm or shant hoti hai
 They can be made relatively easily by giving enough time using an ice shovel
 thik tarah se banaai gayi barf kii gupha kaa taapmaana shunya ke aasapaas mandaraata rahegaa, jiske saapeksh bahari taapmaana garm ho saktaa he
 They can be dug in any place where there is at least four feet of snow
 Quinzi is another type of shelter, which is made by reinforcing snow piles
 kuch parvatarohiyon dwaara iglu kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, lekin ise bananaa kathin he or iske liye kuch vishesh barfili paristhitiyon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Many times in mountaineering, hazards are divided into two categories: objective hazards that are present even when the climber is not present, such as rock fall, avalanche and bad weather, and subjective hazards that are only related to the factors initiated by the climber 
 asaavadhaanee ke kaaran upkaran kii kharabi or tootna, thakaan evam aparyaapt takanic vyaktiparak khatre ke udahaaran hai
 Routes that are constantly changed due to storms and avalanches are considered to have a high level of objective danger, while a technically more difficult route that is relatively safe from these hazards can be considered to be objectively safe
 sankshep main, parvatarohiyon ko in khataron kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie: girti chattaane, girti barf, himaskhalan, parvatarohi kaa girnaa, barfili dhalaanon se girnaa, barfili dhalaanon kaa girnaa, barfili daraaron main girnaa or oonchaai tathaa mausam ke khatre
 in khataron ko kam karne ke liye apane kaushal or anubhav kaa prayog karke ek raste kaa chayan or anusaran karne main hi parvatarohi ke kaushal kii pariksha hoti he
 Each rock is slowly shattered due to erosion, a process that is particularly fast above the ice-line
 chattaanon kaa aakaar pattharon ke girane ke kaaran nirantar parivartit hota rahata he, jis kaaran se dhokhaa ho saktaa he
 Falling rocks form pits on the mountain and these pits have to be climbed very carefully, their edges are often safe while stones fall on the central part
 tazaa mausam ke anusaar chattaane kisi anya chiz kii tulana main zyada girti hai
 Nocturnal snow may temporarily bind the rocks above, but the rising heat or melting of snow during the day can remove these rocks
 aise raaston par girti chattaanon kaa pataa lagane ke liye sthaneey anubhav moolyawaan siddh hote hai
 The direction of the tilt of the rock layer often indicates the severity of the hazard at a specific position; The nature of the rock must also be considered
 Where stone falls frequently, pieces of it will be found below, and falling stones on ice form large pits which are seen from far away
 kisi nae shikhar yaa ek aparichit maarg par chadhane kii yojana banane main parvatarohiyon ko aise nishaanon par vishesh dhyaan dena chahie
 jab girte pathar bahut adhik sankhya main keechaddaar barf yaa pani se milte hai to keechad ke skhalan kaa nirmaan hota he 
 is prakaar kii sambhavit dhalaanon main camping karne se bachanaa chahie
 Locations with a high probability of snow fall can be accurately predicted
 yah himandon ke toote bhaagon main or sakari parvatashrenee ke shikhar par nirmit latakate kinaaron se girti he
 Large icebergs are formed on hard rocks and fall more in good weather withstand cold and stormy days
 girte pattharon kii tarah inase bhi bachanaa zaruri he
 Glaciers form very slowly and reach a state of unstable equilibrium slowly
 They usually fall in the hottest part of the day or shortly thereafter
 ek kushal or anbhavi arohi aamtaur par girti barf ke sabase jatil raste ke bich sabase surakshit maarg kaa chintan karegaa parantu phir bhi garm dinon kii dopaher main aise sthanon se bachanaa chahie
 latakate himand praayah khadi chattaanon par se ek nishchit samyantaral ke baad hat jate hai
 They can always be identified by their debris lying beneath
 inke raste se sadaa bachanaa chahie
 The efficiency of a rock climber is demonstrated by its choice of position and hand, and the skill of holding them after selection
 yah kaaphi had tak us chattan kii kshamta kaa anumaan lagane kii kaabiliyat par nirbhar karata he, jisapar vah khadaa he
 Many weak rocks are strong enough to bear the weight of a person, but experience is needed to know who to trust and skills are required to move the weight without twisting
 kuch kamazor chattaanon par rassi lagaate samay vishesh dhyaan kii zaroorat hoti he, kyonki inase pathar ke neeche girane kii sambhaavna prabal rahati he
 Similarly, proper attention should also be given to them while keeping feet and hands on them
 While crossing the restrictor from quite complex rocks, a dangerous situation may escalate unless both conditions of the restrictor are fixed
 Mutual support has great importance on hard rocks
 do yaa teen arohi ek duusare kii sahaayta se aage badhate hai, athwa duusare dwaara pairon ke liye lagaai gayi barf kii kulhadi par pair rakhkar
 aapasi sahyog kaa sabase pramukh siddhant yah he ki dal ke sabhi sadsy ek duusare kii sahayata se chadhaai karen na ki ek swatantra ikai ke rup main; iname se aage badhate prayek sadsy ko yah pataa hona chahie ki aage or peeche vaala arohi kya kar rahaa he
 a layer of snow is often found on steep rocks after inclement weather, which makes it even more inaccessible
 aisi sthiti main crempon atyant laabhakaari hai
 Avalanche is the lowest risk hazard in the mountains
 log aam taur par yah sochate hai ki ve in khataron ko pahchaanane or isse bachane main sakasham honge
 sachai asal main kaaphi bhinn he
 Every year 120 to 150 people are killed in small icebergs only in the Alps
 inamen adhiktar 20 se 35 kii aayu varg ke anbhavi purush skirs hote hai, lekin isamen ski nirdeshak or guide bhi shaamil hote hai
 There is always danger pressure in crossing the ice plateau
 waapas jane main kaaphi samay or prayaas, behtareen netritv lagata he or sabase mahatvapurn kadaachit himaskhalan hota he jo yah sabit karata he ki sahi nirnay liya gaya tha
 Making the decision to turn becomes even more difficult when other people are crossing the slope as well, but one can become the next person
 himaskhalan ke kai prakaar ke hote hai, lekin do prakaar sabase adhik chintaa ke vishay hai: Hazardous slippery blocks are the place most favored by skiers: tall and wide open, some trees or large rocks, angles of 30 to 45 degrees, just full of fresh snow, big storms Later, on the stormy slope
 Solar radiation can also cause ejaculation
 ye adhiktar bindu relies yaa geela keechad prakaar ke himaskhalan honge
 geeli slide skhalan main judaa vajan shila skhalan kaa chaalu karata he
 Ninety percent of avalanche victims are initiated by them themselves or by other mountaineers of their group
 alpayin raaston par of-pist safar karte samay vaqt dalon ko hameshaa in vastuon ko le jane kii salaah di jaati he
 Avalanche training is also advised to climbers
 vidambnaa yah he ki himaskhalan main hui mauton main sabase pratishat un visheshgy skirs kaa he jinhone himaskhalan prashikshan kiya hota he; shaayad isliye ki ve himaskhalan ke kshetron main ski karnaa zyada pasand karte hon or shaayad isliye kyonki kuch log tej or uyukt muktak banane ke liye apane upkarnon ke saath paryaapt abhyaas nahin karte hai
 Even with the proper rescue equipment and training, one in five is likely to die if trapped in a large avalanche and half are likely to be alive when buried for a few minutes
 iskaa sabase acha samaadhaan yah he ki yah siikhaa jaye ki kis prakaar se jokhim bhari paristithiyon se bachaa jaae
 When traveling on slopes with snow or hard snow, creampons are a standard part of mountaineer's equipment
 jabaki madhyam kone kii barfili dhalaanon par kai baar step-kating kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he, phir bhi yah ek dhimi or thakaaoo prakriya he, jo crempons kii ucch suraksha pradaan nahin karti he
 However, in soft ice or powder, crumpons are easily trapped, due to which their effect is reduced
 anya sthiti main, barf kii kulhadi na keval madad karti he balki arohi ko girane yaa phisalane kii sthiti main khud ko samhaalane kii madad bhi karti he
 Yet on a real snowy slope, the ice ax is rarely effective in catching itself
 barf kii dhalaan par khadey rahane ke liye suraksha ke atirikt ehithiyat ke rup main, barf main dabe barf ke pench parvatarohan kii rassi se bandhe hone chahie
 Real icy slopes are rare in Europe, although quite common in tropical regions, where the newly fallen snow melts on the surface soon and flows down, so the next night's cold, the whole fluid converts into a cold-hardened ice cold it happens
 barf kii dhalaane aam hai or inpar chadhaai karnaa bhi aamtaur par asana hota he
 Beneath the slope of the snowpad or ice there is usually a large ice crack, called Bergskrund, where the last slope of the mountain originates from the ice-field or glacier
 aisi barkscrand chalakar paar karne ke liye bahut chaudee hoti hai or inhen barf ke pul se paar karnaa chahie, jiske liye dhynapurvak parikshan or udhyam purvak rassi ke prayog kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 a slippery hall of steep snow slopes can be dangerous because the entire portion of its ice can begin as an ejaculation
 yadi aisi dhalaanon par tedha chadhane ke sthaan par sidhaa chadha jaae to ye zyada surakshit hoti he, kyonki tirchhe yaa kshaitij raste inhen kaatane lagate hai or inkaa drav bahna armbh ho jaataa he
 New snow falling on frozen ice is particularly dangerous
 barf kii sandehaaspad sthiti hone par pragati kii saadhyataa kii jaanch kar lene kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Snow on the rocks often worsens until it hardens; Ice feels a bit on ice
 ek do din kaa saafe mausam barf ko acchhee sthiti main laa degaa
 barf bahut khadey kone main padi nahin rah sakati he, yadhyapi ankhen isaki dhalaan se dhokhaa kha sakati he
 The snow slope may be inclined to 40 degrees
 sakht jami barf zyada kone tak tik jaati he
 In the morning the snow slopes are hard and safe, but likewise in the afternoon some become soft and dangerous; So there is an advantage in walking quickly
 him daraar ve daraaren yaa gahari khaiyaan hai, jo kisi himand ke padaarthon ke asmaan tal se guzarane par nirmit hoti hai
 They may be open or hidden
 himand ke nichle bhaagon main him daraaren khuli hoti hai
 Above the snow line, they are often hidden by the arched accumulation of winter snow
 chuphi daraaron kaa pataa lagaana badi saavdhaanee or anubhav kaa kaam he
 They can be detected by the sound of an ice ax rod after fresh snow falls, or by looking to the right and left where a partially covered ice crack corner may be open
 durghatana ke khilaaf rassi hi suraksha he or kisi ko bhi kabhi bhi barf se dhakaa himand tabatak paar nahin karnaa chahie jabatak uske paas rassi na ho, yaa phir do saathi ho to or acha he
 Anyone crossing the crevices should also be proficient in protecting from snow cracks
 karaab mausam ke kaaran barf or chattan ki sthitiyon main hone vaale parivartan mukhya rup se khatarnaak hote hai, saamaanya paristithiyon ki tulana main achaanak ghatit hone vaali ye ghatnaye zyada dubhar or hanikaarak hoti hai
 It is difficult to re-locate a path in a white sheet of snow, while rain also prevents the easiest path in dry conditions
 toofaan main keval anubhavyukt paryvekshakon ki tulana main disha ke liye compass kaa prayog karne vaale parvatarohiyon ko zyada laabh hota he
 Of course, in large icy areas, it is more common to go on the wrong track than on a rock, but intelligence and experience are the best aids to escape safely from past threats
 garmi kii aandhi teevr bijli kaa nirmaan bhi kar sakati he
 If climbers are on or near the summit, there is a danger of being killed
 aise kai cese hai, jiname parvat chadhate samay bijli se maare gaye
 In most mountainous regions, localized storms occur after dawn and before dawn
 adhiktar arohi "alpine shuruyaat" lete hai; jo subah se pehle yaa pehali kiran se hota he taaki toofaan kii gatividhi or bijli tej hone par or anya mausami khataron se surakshit rahen
 tej hawaaen hypothermia ke akraman ko baadha saktin hai, saath hi upkarnon ko habi nasht kar sakati hai jaise ki aashray ke liye upyog hone vaala tent
 kuch vishisht sthitiyon main, toofaan jalprapaat kaa nirmaan bhi kar sakate hai, jis kaaran se parvatarohan ki prakriya dhimi yaa band ho sakati he
 The windy winds are a living example of this on the Mount Eijer
 tezi se chadhaai karne se 'atitude sickness' ho sakati he
 The best treatment for this is to come down immediately
 The slogan of ascending at very high is "climb higher, sleep less", which means that the patrons climbed higher to get acclimated but came down to sleep
 In the Andes of South America, coca leaves have traditionally been chewed to avoid acute sickness disease
 atitude sickness ke saamaanya lakshanon main sakht sirdard, sone kii samasya, matlee, bhukh kii kami, susti or badan dard he
 Mountain weakness can increase to hese and hep, both of which can cause death within 24 hours
 oonche parvaton main, vayumandaleey daab kam hota he or is kaaran se saans ke liye oxijan kii kami hoti he
 This is the underlying cause of Attitude Sickness
 har kisi ko abhyast hone kii aavashyaktaa he, yahan tak ki un anbhavi parvatarohiyon ko bhi jo itani oonchaaiyon par pehle bhi chadh chuke hai
 Generally, climbers use bottled artificial oxygen while climbing above 7000 meters
 kuch vishesh parvatarohi oxijan ke bina hi 8000 meter tak kii chotii par chadh jate hai, jiske liye hameshaa abhyaas kaa suniyojit aayojan hota he
 Solar radiation increases significantly in altitude because the atmosphere becomes thinner as it rises, which causes it to absorb less ultraviolet radiation
 barf kaa aavaran vikiran ko paravartit karke baadha saktaa he jis kaaran se dhup main jhulasane or barf ke andhepan kaa khatra 75% tak bad jaataa he
 In 2005, researcher and mountaineer John Sample proved that higher-than-average ozone concentrations in the Tibetan Plateau could pose an additional risk for climbers
 kuch parvat sakriy jwalamukhi hote hai jaise ki sanyojit jwalamukhi jo dweep khandon kii sabase oonchi chotii or andes ke kuch bhaagon main banate hai
 The explosion of these volcanic mountains can pose many hazards, such as lehre, pyroclastic flows, falling rocks, lava flows, large amounts of tephra falling, volcanic eruptions and toxic gases

 Europe and North America, in the middle of Mohimechya style, there is a thunderstorm, due to the many mountain air migration, by carving the pohochu shaktat, te kami, high uneven and tearing, one day and two days
 The differences between the two embarkation styles, and the benefits and dangers are as follows: === Expedition ascension === * Many trips had to be made to carry goods from the lower camps to the upper camps
 Arohan Style Mileage Advantage Matter riskier or both configurations
 * The crew size is also larger due to the need for more supplies between the camps than the Alpine style
 * alpine shailishi tulana kelyas, shibiradarmyaan adhik puravathyachi garaj yamule sanghacha aakaar adhik mothaa asato

 Mountaineering has become a popular sport worldwide
 europe main yah kaaphi had tak alps main armbh hua tha or abhi bhi vahaan behad lokapriy he
 Other mountain ranges famous among the mountaineers are the Kaukasas, Pairenis, Rila ranges, Tatra ranges and Karpathian mountain ranges

 The Great Ranges have a long tradition of expeditions to the expedition, a general term often used for the high mountains of the Andes and Asia, including the Himalayas, Karakoram, Pamir and Tien Shan
 ateet main yah praarambhik yatra yaa pehali chadhaai karne ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 With the arrival of cheap long-distance air travel, these 'great Ranges' mountaineering holidays have become more accessible

 Hume is considered to be an English officer who not only thought about his future too much but also worked on it
 vaise to itawa kaa vajood hum ke yahan aane se pehle hi ho gaya tha lekin hum ne jo kuch diya uske koi duusari misaal dekhne ko kahin bhi nahin milti
 Despite being an English officer, this Etawah love of Hume became a cause of trouble for him
 inhone bharat main bhinn-bhinn padon par kaam kiya or 1882 main avkaash grahan kiya
 At the same time, due to the unsatisfactory actions of the British Government, amazing awareness arose in India and they began to organize themselves
 is kaary main hum sahab se bharatiyon badi prerana mili
 In the last part of 1884, the Indian National Union was formed with the efforts of Surendranath Banerjee and Vyomesh Chandra Banerjee and Hume Sahab
 27 disambar 1885 ko bharat ke bhinn-bhinn bhaagon se bhartiya netaa bombai pahunche or duusare din sammelan aarambh hua
 All the management of this conference was done by Hume Saheb
 is pratham sammelan ke sabhapati vyomeshchandra banerjee banaae gaye the jo bade yogya tathaa pratishthit bengali chrishchiyan vakil the
 This conference became known as "indian National Congress"
 hum bharatvasiyon ke sachche mitra the
 He propagated the principles of the Congress through his articles and lectures
 inkaa prabhaav england kii janata par santoshjanak padaa
 It was only during the reign of Viceroy Lord Dufferin that the British Government began to look at the Congress with suspicion
 hum sahab ko bhi bharat chhodane kii rajagna mili
 Hume's friends were Dada Bhai Naoroji, Sir Surendranath Banerjee, Sir Firoz Shah Mehta, Mr
 Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Mr
 Vyomeshchandra Banerjee, Mr
 Balgangadhar Tilak etc
 inke dwaara shashan tathaa samaaj main anek sudhaar hue
 During his sabbatical, he tried to get more and more Indians to the British government
 is sambandh main unako kai baar england bhi janaa padaa
 In England, Hume sahab told the British that Indians are now able to manage their own country
 unako angrejon kii bhanti sab prakaar ke adhikaar praapt hone chahie or sarkari naukariyon main bhi samanta hona aavashyak he
 They will not sit peacefully until this happens
 england kii sarkaar ne hum sahab ke sujhaavon ko sweekaar kiya
 The people of India started getting the biggest government posts
 congress ko sarkaar acchhee drushti se dekhne lagi or uske sujhaavon kaa sammaan karne lagi
 Every suggestion of Hume sahib and Vyomeshchandra Banerjee was considered by the English government and consulted them in every government work
 hum apane ko bhartiya hi samajhate the
 He loved Indian food more
 gita tathaa bible ko pratidin padhaa karte the
 His speeches contained Indian ideas and how the Indian public can be made happy and how the British government should treat the Indian public, he used to say all these things in his articles and speeches
 ve kehete the ki bharat main ekta tathaa sanghatan kii badi aavashyaktaa he
 Whenever Indians will adopt both these qualities, at that time the British will leave India
 hum lokmaanya balgangadhar tilak ko sachcha deshbhakt tathaa bharat mata kaa suputr samajhate the
 They believed that they would be able to give India independence through their efforts
 abul hasan yaminuddin amir khusro chaudaavin sadi ke lagbhag dilli ke nikat rahane vaale ek pramukh kavi shaayar, gayak or sangeetkaar the
 His family belonged to the court for many generations
 Amir Khusro himself had witnessed the rule of eight sultans
 Amir Khusro was the first Muslim poet to use Hindi words openly
 He was the first person who wrote together in Hindi, Hindu and Persian
 i am credited with the invention of Khadi Boli
 He is known for his riddles and reticence
 sabase pehle unheen ne apni bhashaa ke liye hindai kaa ullekh kiya tha
 He was also a Persian poet
 unako dilli sultanate kaa aashray mila hua tha
 The list of his books is long
 saath hi inkaa itihaas strot rup main mahatva he
 Amir Khusro, son of Turk Saifuddin of the Lachan caste of Central Asia, was born in the town of Patiali in Etah, Uttar Pradesh
 lachan jati ke turk changez khan ke akramanon se peedit hokar balban ke rajyakaal main ‘’sharnaarthi ke rup main bharat main aa based the
 Khusro's mother Balbanke was the daughter of war minister Imadutul Mulk and an Indian Muslim woman
 saat varsh kii avasthaa main khusro ke pita kaa dehant ho gaya
 As a teenager, he started writing poetry and by the age of 20 he became famous as a poet
 khusro main vyavhaarik buddhi kii koi kami nahin thi
 Khusro never disregarded social life
 khusro ne apana sara jivan rajshray main hi bitaayaa
 Even while staying in the court, Khusro always remained a poet, artist, musician and soldier
 sahitya ke atirikt sangeet ke kshetra main bhi khusro kaa mahatvapurn yogadan he i unhone bhartiya or irani raagon kaa sundar mishran kiya or ek naveen raag style imaan, jilf, sajgari aadi ko janm diya i bhartiya gayan main qavvaalior sitar ko inhen kii dein mana jaataa he
 He has also written many puzzles and couplets in Persian and on the lines of the song, including the words of Arabic Ghazal
 inke teen putron main abulahasan sabase bade the - 4 baras kii umr main ve dilli laae gaye
 At the age of 8, he became a disciple of the famous Sufi Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya
 16-17 saal kii umr main ve amiron ke ghar shaayari padhane lage the
 Once in a Mushaira in Delhi, Balban's nephew Sultan Muhammad liked Khusro's poetry and took him with him to Multan
 sultan mohammad khud bhi ek acha shaayar tha - usne khusro ko ek acha ohada diya
 Masnavi was written in which there were 20 thousand lions - remember that at the same time Maulana Rumi, perhaps the best poet of the world, was also writing or had written a masnavi in madhyaturki
 5 saal tak multan main unka jindagi bahut aisho aaraam se guzari
 At the same time, one of the Mongols was invading Punjab
 inako qaid kar heraat le jaaya gaya - mongolon ne sultan mohammad kaa sar kalam kar diya tha
 After two years, he was left seeing his lack of military aspiration and the style of poetry
 phir yo patiyaali pahunche or phir dilli aae
 Told Balban the whole story - Balban too fell ill and then died
 phir kaikubad ke darbar main bhi ye rahe - wo bhi inaki shaayari se bahut prasann rahaa or inhe mulukashuara ghoshit kiya
 At this time Jalaluddin Khilji invaded Delhi and took control of power
 usne bhi inako sthai sthaan diya
 When Khilji's nephew and son-in-law Alauddin captured power by killing 70-year-old Jalaluddin, he kept Amir Khusro in the court
 chittod par chadhaai ke samay bhi amir khusro ne allaudin khilji ko manaa kiya lekin wo nahin mana
 After this Malik Kafur took power from Alauddin Khilji and Mubarak Shah from Malik Kafur
