ali ne yuddh main kai anya makka sainikon ko bhi haraa diya
 According to Muslim traditions, Ali killed between twenty-five enemies in battle, mostly agreeing with the Seventh; While all other Muslims jointly killed another seventh
 ali uhood kii ladaai main pramukh the, saath hi saath kai anya ladaayeeein jahaan unhone ek vibhajit talwaar kii raksha kii jise julfikar kaha jaataa he
 He had a special role to protect Muhammad when most of the Muslim army fled the battle of Uhud and was told "there is no brave youth except Ali and no sword who serves except Zulfiqar
 " vah khabar kii ladaai main muslim sena ke commander the
 After this war, Mohammed named Ali Asadullah, meaning "lion of God"
 ali ne 630 main hunain kii ladaai main mohammad kaa bhi bachaav kiya
 Muhammad named 'ali as one of the scribes who would write the text of the Quran, which was revealed to Muhammad during the last two decades
 jaise hi islam puure arab main failana shuru kar diya, ali ne nae islamic aadesh kii sthapana main madad kii
 He was instructed in 628 to write a peace treaty between Muhammad and the Quraysh to Huddabiyyah
 ali itane bharosemand or bharosemand the ki mohammad ne unhen sandesh le jane or aadesh ghoshit karne ke liye kaha tha
 In 630, Ali recounted at a large gathering of pilgrims in Mecca that a portion of the Quran that Muhammad and the Islamic community were not bound by the earlier agreement with Arab polytheists
 630 main makka kii vijay ke dauraan, mohammad ne ali se yah guarantee dene ke liye kaha ki vijay khooni hogi
 He ordered Ali to dismantle all the idols worshiped by the people of Banu Aus, Banu Khajraj, Tayi and Kaaba after their defilement from pre-islamic era polytheism
 islam kii shikshaaon ko failaane ke liye ali ko ek saal baad yaman bheja gaya tha
 He was also accused of settling many disputes and setting off the rebellion of various tribes
 yah bhi dekhen: ahal al-baitahadis sangrah ke anusaar, 631 main, najraan se ek arab isai doot mohammad ke paas aayaa or yah tark diya ki donon pakshon ne yishu ke bare main apane siddhant main kya kiya tha
 After comparing Jesus' miraculous birth to Adam's creation, Muhammad called them Mubhala, where each party brought its knowledgeable men, women and children, and ask Allah to curse the lying party and their followers 
 mohammad, unhen sabit karne ke liye ki vah ek bhavishyadvaktaa tha, ne apni beti fatima, ali or uske pote hasan or hossain ko laayaa
 He went to the Christians and said "this is my family" and covered himself and his family with a cloak
 muslim sroton ke mutabik, jab ek isai bhikshuon ne apane chehre dekhe, to unhone apane saathi ko salaah di ki ve apane jivan or pariwaron ke liye mubahaalaa se waapas aaen
 Thus the Christian monks disappeared from Mubhala place
 allameh tababatei tafaseer al-mizaan main bataati hai ki is kavita main "hamaara khud" shabd mohammad or ali ko sanderbhit karata he
 Then he describes how Imam Ali al-rida, the eighth Shia Imam, in discussion with al-mamun, the Abbasid Caliph, mentions this verse to prove the superiority of Muhammad's lineage to the rest of the Muslim community, and calls it The evidence is believed to be due to Ali's making of Ali as Muhammad, for Ali's right to the Caliphate
 chunki mohammad 632 main apni aakhri tirthayatra se laut rahe the, unhone ali ke bare main bayaan die jinhen sunnis or shiyas ne bahut alag tareeke se vyakhya kii he
 They halted the caravan at Gadir Khum, gathered the returning pilgrims for communal prayer and began addressing them
 islam ke vishwakosh ke anusaar: The Shia consider these headquarters as the designation of Ali as Muhammad's successor and first imam; In contrast, Sunnis only take him as an expression of the close spiritual relationship between Muhammad and Ali, and Ali, as his cousin and son-in-law, inherits his family responsibilities upon his death, but must
 Not that his post was a political right many Sufis regard this episode as a transfer of Muhammad's spiritual power and authority to Ali
 Understand that they regard as the Valley overall excellence
 shiya or sunni donon strot bataate hai ki, upadesh ke baad, abu bakar, umr or uthman ne ali ko nishtha kaa vachan diya tha

 After Muhammad's death another part of Ali's life began in 632 and the third caliph 'uthman ibn' Afan in 656
 The murder went on
 un 24 varshon ke dauraan, ali ne na to kisi bhi yuddh yaa vijay main bhaag liya, na hi unhone koi kaaryakari pad sambhala
 He withdrew from political affairs, especially after the death of his wife Fatima Zahra
 unhone apane parivaar kii seva karne or ek kisaan ke rup main kaam karne ke liye apana samay istemaal kiya
 Ali opened several wells and planted gardens near Medina and endowed them for public use
 in kuon ko aaj abar ali ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Ali compiled a complete version of the Quran, Musaf, six months after Muhammad's death
 madina ke anya logon ko dikhaane ke liye wolum puraa ho gaya tha or oont dwaara kiya gaya tha
 The order of this mushaf differed from that which was later gathered during the Uthmanic era
 is pustak ko kai logon ne khaarij kar diya jab unhone unhen dikhaaya
 Despite this, Ali made no resistance against the standardized mus'haf
 apane jivan ke aakhri saalon main arab janajatiyon ko ek muslim dharmik raajnneeti main ekajute karne ke baad, 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ne is baat par asahmati vyakt kii ki muslim samudaay ke netaa ke rup main unhen koun safal karegaa
 While Ali and the rest of Muhammad's close family were washing their bodies for burial, a small group of Muslims took part in Saqifah, one of Muhammad's close companions, Abu Bakr, was named to lead the community
 dusron ne apana samarthan joda or abu bakar ko pehla khalipha banaaya gaya tha
 The choice of Abu Bakr was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who said that Ali was nominated by Muhammad as his successor
 baad main jab fatimah or ali ne khalipha ke adhikaar ke maamle main sahaygiyon se sahaayta maangi, to unhone uttar diya, 'he bhagwaan ke macenjar kii beti! hamane abu bakar ko apana nishtha diya he
 If Ali had come to us earlier, we certainly would not have abandoned him
 ali ne kaha, 'kya yah uchit tha ki paigambar ko dafnaae jane se pehle hamen khalipha par jhagada karnaa chahie?' After the Khilafat election, Abu Bakr and Umar along with some other companions went to Fatima's house to force Ali and his supporters who had gathered to pledge their allegiance to Abu Bakr
 phir, yah aarope lagaaya gaya he ki umr ne aag lagane kii dhamkee di thi jab tak ve baahar nahin aae or abu bakar ke prati nishtha kii kasam khai
 Fatima, in support of her husband, triggered a seduction and threatened to "expose her hair", to which Abu Bakr repented and withdrew
 ali ne baar-baar kaha he ki unke saath chalis purush the, unhone virodh kiya hoga
 Ali did not actively assert his authority because he did not want to throw the nascent Muslim community into conflict
 anya sutron kaa kahana he ki ali ne umr ke chayan ko khalipha ke rup main sweekaar kar liya or yahaan tak ki unki betiyon um kulthum ko shaadi main bhi diya
 This controversial issue later divided Muslims into two groups, Sunni and Shia
 sunnis ne jor dekar kaha ki mohammad ne kabhi uttaradhikari niyukt nahin kiya he, phir bhi abu bakar muslim samudaay dwaara pehle khalif chune gaye the
 Sunnis identify the first four Caliphs as the rightful successors of Muhammad
 shiyas kaa maananaa he ki mohammad ne spasht rup se ali ko gadir khum main unke uttaradhikari ke rup main namit kiya or muslim netritv unase sambandhit tha jo divya aadesh dwaara nirdhaarit kiye gaye the
 According to Wilferd Madelung, Ali himself was convinced of his legitimacy for the Caliph based on his close association with Muhammad, his close relationship and his knowledge of Islam and his qualifications in serving his virtues
 unhone abu bakar se kaha ki khalipha ke rup main nishtha ko pratigya karne main unki deree unke pehle ke sheershak kii unki dharna par aadhaarit thi
 Ali ultimately pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr and then to Umar and Uthman, but did so for the unity of Islam, once it became clear that the Muslims had turned away from him
 ali ne yah bhi mana ki vah is ladaai ke bina imamet kii apni bhoomika puri kar saktaa he
 At the beginning of the Caliphate of Abu Bakr, there was a dispute between Muhammad's daughter, especially Phadak, Fatimah and Ali on one side and Abu Bakr on the other
 fatima ne abu bakar se apni sampatti, fada or khayabar kii bhoomi ko badalane ke liye kaha 
 But Abu Bakr refused and told him that the prophets had no inheritance and that Phadak belonged to the Muslim community
 abu bakar ne usase kaha, "allaah ke prerit ne kaha, hamaare uttaradhikari nahin hai, jo kuch bhi ham chhodte hai vah sadaaka he 
 "together with Umm Ayman, Ali testified to the fact that Muhammad gave it to Fatima Zahra, when Abu Bakr requested him to summon witnesses for his claim
 fatima gusse main ho gai or abu bakar se baat karnaa band kar diya, or jab tak vah mar gai, tab tak vah ravaiya maanate rahe
 'aisha also states that "when the Apostle of Allah died, his wives asked Uthman to send Abu Bakr to ask for his share of the inheritance
 " tab 'aisha ne unase kaha, "kya allaah ke prerit ne nahin kaha,' hamaari sampatti viraasat main nahin he, or jo bhi ham chhodte hai vah daan main kharch kiya janaa chahie?" According to some sources, Ali did not swear allegiance to Abu Bakr sometime after the death of his wife Fatima in the year 633
 'ali ne abu bakar ke antim sanskaar main bhaag liya
 He pledged allegiance to the second Khalifa Umar ibn Khattab and helped him as a trusted advisor
 umr vishesh rup se ali par madina ke mukhya nyaayadhish ke rup main nirbhar tha
 He advised Umar to set the hijra as the beginning of the Islamic calendar
 umr ne raajnneetik muddon ke saath-saath dharmik logon main ali ke sujhaavon kaa istemaal kiya
 'ali was one of the electoral council to elect a third caliph appointed by Omar
 haalanki 'ali do pramukh ummidavaaron main se ek tha, parishad kii vyavastha unke khilaaf thi
 Saad ibn Abi Waqqas and Abdur Rahman bin Awf, who were cousins, were naturally inclined to support Uthman, who was Abdur Rahman's son-in-law
 iske alaava, umr ne abdur rahamaan ko casting vot diya
 Abdur Rahman offered the Caliph to Ali on the condition that he should rule according to the Quran, the example set by Muhammad, and the precedent set by the first two Caliphs
 ali ne teesri shart se inkaar kar diya jabaki uthman ne use sweekaar kar liya
 His reputation at the summit of Ilokens Ali was emphasized according to the comments of Ilon Abi al-hadid, but most voters reluctantly urged Uthman and Ali to support him
 'uthman ebn' afaan ne apane rishtedaar banu abd-shams kii ore udaartaa vyakt kii, jo unke upar haaavee hone lagate the, or abu dhar al-ghifaari, abd-allaah ebn masood or amaar jaise kai shuruaati saathi ke prati unke ghamandi durvyavhaar ebn yasir ne logon ke kuch samoohon ke bich apmaan ko uksaaya
 Dissatisfaction and resistance openly arose in most of the empire from 650–651 onwards
 unke shashan or unke dwaara niyukt sarkaron ke saath asantosh arab ke baahar praanton tak hi simit nahin tha
 When Uthman's relatives, especially Marwan, gained control over him, the Great Council, which included most of the members of the Voters' Council, turned against him or at least withdrew his support, pressuring the Caliphate and his ways
 Reducing the impact of your firm relationship
 is samay, ali ne uthman par sidhe virodh kiye bina ek sanyam prabhaav ke rup main kaary kiya tha
 On several occasions Ali disagreed with Udhaman in the application of Hudud; He had publicly shown sympathy for Abu Dhrr al-ghifari and spoke strongly in defense of Ammar ibn Yasir
 unhone uthman ko anya sahyogiyon kii aalochanaon ke bare main bataaya or uthman kii taraf se prantiy virodhiyon ke saath vaartakar ke rup main kaary kiya jo madina aae the; is vajah se ali or uthman ke parivaar ke bich kuch avishvaas utpann hua prathit hota he
 Eventually, he tried to reduce the severity of the siege with his insistence that Uthman should be allowed water
 itihaaskaaron ke bich ali or uthman ke bich sambandhon ke bare main vivaad he
 Although pledging allegiance to Uthman, Ali disagreed with some of his policies
 vishesh rup se, unhone dharmik kanoon ke sawaal par uthman ke saath sangharsh kiya
 He insisted that religious punishment should be done in many cases like Ubaid Allah ibn Umar and Walid ibn Ukba
 tirthayatra ke dauraan 650 main, unhone uthman se prarthana anushthan ke parivartan ke liye apmaan ke saath saamana kiya
 When Uthman announced that he would take whatever he had from the fees, Ali said that the caliph would be forced into that case
 ali ne ebn masood jaise khalipha dwaara maatrutiv se saathi kii raksha karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Therefore, some historians consider Ali as one of the leading members of Uthman's opposition, if not the chief
 lekin wilferd madelangais tathy ke kaaran unke faisle ko khaarij kar diya gaya ki ali ke paas khalipha ke rup main chune jane ke liye kuraishi kaa samarthan nahin tha
 According to him, there is no evidence that Ali had close ties with the rebels who supported his caliphate or directed his actions
 kuch anya sutron kaa kahana he ki ali ne uthman par sidhe virodh kiye bina ek sanyam prabhaav ke rup main kaary kiya tha
 However, Madelang told Marwan that Ali's grandson Zayn al-abidin had said that koi bhi aapke guru kii tulana main hamaare guru kii tulana main adhik samshitoshna tha
 During one of the most difficult periods in Muslim history, Ali was the Caliph between 656 and 661, which also coincided with the first Fitnah
 chunki jin sangharshon main ali shaamil the, ve dhruviya sampradayik itihaslekh main kaayam the, jeevani saamagree aksar pakshpatpurna hoti he
 But the sources agree that he was a deeply religious man, who was ruled by justice because of Islam and according to the Quran and Sunnah; He was engaged in a war against Muslims in terms of religious duties
 sutron ne apane tapasya, dharmik kartavyon kaa kathor paalan, or sansaarik vastuon se alag hone par notice main ullekh kiya he
 Thus some authors have reported that they lack political skills and flexibility
 uthman kii hatya kaa matlab tha ki vidrohiyon ko ek nayaa khalipha chunanaa padaa
 This met with difficulties as the rebels were divided into several groups including Muhajirun, Ansar, Egyptians, Kufans and Basarites
 teen ummidavaar the: ali, talhah or al-jubayr 
 First the rebels approach Ali, requesting him to be the fourth Caliph
 mohammad ke kuch saathi ne ali ko karyaalay sweekaar karne ke liye raji karne kii koshish kii, lekin unhone prastaav ko band kar diya, ek pramukh ke bajaay paramarshdaata hone kaa suzav diya
 Talha, Zubayr, and other companions refused the Khalifa's offer of rebels
 isliye, vidrohiyon ne madina ke nivaasiyon ko ek din ke bheetar ek khalipha chunane kii chetavanee di, yaa ve kathor karrwai lagu karenge
 To resolve the deadlock, Muslims gathered at al-masjid an-nabawi on June 18, 656 to appoint a caliph
 prarambh main, 'ali ne ise sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya, kyonki sirf unke sabase shashakt samarthak vidrohiyon the
 However, when some of Muhammad's notable companions other than the residents of Medina urged him to accept the offer, he eventually agreed
 abu mekhanaaf ke mutabikka varnan, talhah pehle pramukh saathi the jinhone 'ali ko apana pratigya di, lekin anya kathaon ne anyathaa daawa kiya ki unhen apni pratigya dene ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 In addition, Talhah and az-zubayr later claimed that they reluctantly supported him
 bhale hi, ali ne in daavon ko khaarij kar diya, jor dekar kaha ki unhone unhen sleep swechha se manyata di he
 Wilferd Madelung believes the force did not urge people to pledge and publicly pledged at the mosque
 jabaki madina kii aabaadi ke saath-saath kai vidrohiyon ne apni pratigya di, kuch mahatvapurn aankade yaa janajatiyon ne aisa nahin kiya
 Uthman's relatives fled to the Umayyad Levant, or remained in their homes, later denying 'ali's legitimacy'
 saad ebn abi vakkaas anupasthit the or 'abdulla ebn' umr ne apane nishtha kii peshkash karne se roak diya, lekin donon ne 'ali ko aashwaasan diya ki ve unke khilaaf kaary nahin karenge
 Ali thus inherited the Rashidun Caliphate — which stretched from Egypt in the west to the Iranian hills in the east — while the situation in Hejaz and other provinces on the eve of his election was unsettled
 ali khalipha banane ke turant baad, unhone prantiy governron ko khaarij kar diya jinhen uthman ne niyukt kiya tha, unhen bharosemand sahyogiyon ke saath badal diya tha
 He acted against the lawyers of Mugira ibn Shuba and Ibn Abbas, who had carefully advised them to proceed with their rule
 madelang kaa kahana he ki ali apane adhikaar or unke dharmik mishan se gaharaai se aashwast the, raajnneetik yogyata ke liye apane siddhanton se samjhauta karne ke icchhuk nahin the, or baari baadhaon ke khilaaf ladane ke liye taiyaar the
 Mu'awiyah I, the founder of Uthman and the governor of the Levant, refused to submit to Ali's orders; He was the only governor to do so
 hagiya sophia main islamic sulekh ke saath ali kaa naam, jab unhen khalipha niyukt kiya gaya, ali ne madina ke nagarikon se kaha ki muslim raajnneeti asantosh or vivaad se peedit hui he; vah kisi bhi buraai ke islam ko shuddh karnaa chahta tha
 He advised the population to behave as true Muslims, warning that it would not tolerate any treason and that those found guilty of subversive activities would be dealt with harshly
 aaisha, talha, al-zubair or umayyadon, vishesh rup se muawiyah i or maravan main, dangaiyon jo maar daalaa tha dandit karne ke liye karnaa chahta tha 'ali uthman
 They camped close to Basra
 vaarta kai dinon tak chali or baad main garam vinimay or parali ke dauraan virodh pradarshnon se uda, jisase donon taraf jivan kii haani hui
 The battle of camels in confusion began in 656, where Ali emerged victorious
 kuch itihaaskaar maanate hai ki unhone is mudde kaa istemaal apni raajnneetik mahatvakankshaon ko khojane ke liye kiya kyonki unhen ali ke khalipha apane phaayde ke khilaaf mila
 The rebels said that Uthman was executed for not ruling according to the Quran and Sunnah, so no retaliation was to be done
 kuch log kehete hai ki khalipha vidrohiyon kaa uphaar tha or ali ke paas unhen niyantrit karne yaa dandit karne ke liye paryaapt bal nahin tha, jabaki anya kehete hai ki ali ne vidrohiyon ke tark ko sweekaar kiya yaa kam se kam vichaar nahin kiya uthman ek shaasha shaasha
 Under such circumstances, a dispute ensued that started the first civil war in Muslim history
 uthamanion ke naam se jane vaale kuch musalamaanon ne uthman ko ant tak ek sahi or sirf khalipha mana, jise avaidh tareeke se maar diya gaya tha
 Some others, known as Ali's party, believed that Uthman had fallen into error, seized the caliphate and refused to reform or step in their own way legally
 Was executed in law; Thus Ali was just and true Imam and atheists among his opponents
 yah khud ali kii sthiti nahin thi
 This civil war created permanent divisions within the Muslim community who had legitimate authority to occupy the Caliphate
 pratham fitnaa, 656-661, uthman kii hatya ke baad, ali ke khalipha ke dauraan jari rakhaa, or khalipha ke muavia kii dharna dwaara samaapt kiya gaya tha
 This civil war is regretted as the end of the early unity of the Islamic Ummah
 ali ne basra ke governor 'abd allaah ebn al'-abbaas niyukt kiye or iraq main muslim garrison shahar kupha main apni rajdhani chali gai
 After the roman-persian Wars and the Byzantine Sasani War that lasted for hundreds of years, there were deep-rooted differences between Iraq, formally in the Persian Sassanid Empire and Syria formally under the Byzantine Empire
 iraqi chaahate the ki nae sthapit islamic rajya kii rajdhani kupha main ho taaki ve apane kshetra main rajasav laa saken or syria kaa virodh kar saken
 He convinced Ali to come to Kufa and establish a capital at Kufa in Iraq
 baad main levant ke governor muvayah pratham or uthman ke chachere bhai ne ali kii nishtha kii maangon se inkaar kar diya
 Ali opened up hopes of regaining his allegiance, but Muawiyah insisted on Levant autonomy under his rule
 muvayah ne apane laventine samarthakon ko sangathit karke or ali ko shradhanjali arpit karne se inkaar kar diya ki unke dal ne apane chunaav main bhaag nahin liya tha
 Ali shifted his forces to the north and the two armies encamped themselves in Siffin for more than a hundred days, most of the time being spent in conversation
 yadhyapi ali ne muvayah ke saath kai patron kaa aadan-pradaan kiya, lekin vah uttararddh ko khaarij karne main asamarth tha, na hi use nishtha dene kaa vachan dene ke liye raji kiya
 a confrontation between the parties led to the Battle of Siffin in 657
 ek saptaah ke yuddh ke baad ek hinsak ladaai ke baad lalit al-harir ke naam se janaa jaataa tha, muvayah kii sena margauntarit hone ke bindu par thi jab amrit ebn al-aas ne muvayah ko apane sainikon ko oochhaalane kii salaah di thi 
 Ali watched through the stratagem, but only a minority wanted to chase the fight
 aakhir main do senaayen is baat ko sulajhane ke liye sahamat huin ki madhyasthata se khalipha koun hona chahie
 The refusal of the largest block in Ali's army to fight was the deciding factor in the acceptance of arbitration
 sawaal yah he ki kya madhyasth ali yaa kufaan kaa pratinidhitiv karegaa, ali kii sena main aage vibhaajan hua he
 Ashath ibn q and some others rejected Ali's candidates as 'abd Allah ibn' Abbas and Malik al-ashtar, and insisted on Abu Musa Ashari for his neutrality
 ant main, ali ko abu musa ko sweekaar karne kaa aagrah kiya gaya tha
 Amrit ibn al-a was appointed by Mu'awiyah as a mediator
 saat maheene baad do madhyasthon ne farvari 658 main jordan main maan ke uttar pashchim main 10 mile uttar pashchim main mulaakaat kii
 Amrit ibn al-abu Musa Ashari assured that both Ali and Mu'awiyah should step in and elect a new caliph
 ali or unke samarthak is faisle se dar gaye the, jisane khalipha ko vidrohi muvayah kii sthiti main kam kar diya tha
 Therefore Ali was called by Mu'awiyah and Amr ibn al-s
 jab daumit-ul-jandal main madhyasthon ne ikattha kiya, to unke liye maamalon kii charchaa karne ke liye dainik baithkon kii ek shrinkhalaa kii vyavastha kii gai
 When it came time to make a decision about the Caliph, Amrit bin al-aas convinced Abu Musa al-ashari to entertain that he should deprive both Ali and Mu'awiya of the Caliphate, and the Muslims to make elections
 The Caliph Abu Musa al-ashari also decided to act accordingly
 punavala ke anusaar, aisa lagata he ki madhyasthon ke bahishkaar ke saath madhyasth or anya pratishthit vyaktiyon ne janvari 65 9 main nae khalif ke chayan par charchaa ke liye mulaakaat kii
 Amrit supported Muawiyah, while Abu Musa preferred his son-in-law Abdullah ibn Umar, but the latter unanimously refused to stand for election
 abu musa ne prastaavit kiya, or amrit sahamat hue, ali or muvayah donon ko chhodane or shura ko nae khalif kaa chayan jamaa karne ke liye sahamat hue
 The public declaration after Abu Musa saw his share of the pact, but Amrit declared Ali and confirmed Muawiya as the Caliph
 ali ne unke faisle ko sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya or chunaav hone ke liye or madhyasthata kaa paalan karne ke liye apane pratigya kaa ulanghan karne main takneekee rup se paaya
 Ali protested, stating that it was not binding on the contrary to the Quran and Sunnah
 phir usne ek nai sena ko vyavasthit karne kii koshish kii, lekin malik ashtar kii aguai main kurr ke avshesh ansaar, or unke kuch kulon ne vafaadaar bane rahe
 This also put Ali in a vulnerable position among his supporters
 madhyasthata ke parinamswaroop 'ali ke gathbandhan ke vighatan main, or kuch ne kaha he ki yah muvayah kaa iraadaa tha
 The most vocal opponents in Ali's camp were the same people who forced Ali into a ceasefire
 unhone ali ke bal se tod diya, naaraazgi ke tahat raily "madhyasthata akele bhagwaan se sambandhit he
 “this group came to be known as Kharijites
 unhone sabhi ko apana dushman mana
 In 659 Ali's army and Kharijites met at the Battle of Naharvan
 tab kurra kharijiyon ke naam se janaa jane laga
 The Kharijites then started killing Ali's supporters and other Muslims
 unhone kisi aise vyakti ko mana jo avishvasi ke rup main apane samooh kaa hissaa nahin tha
 Although 'ali won the battle by a large margin, the constant struggle was beginning to affect his position
 iraqiyon se nipatane ke dauraan, ali ko ek anushaasit sena or prabhavi rajya sansthaanon kaa nirmaan karnaa mushkil ho gaya
 He spent a lot of time fighting the Kharijites
 natijatan, 'ali ko apane purvi morche par rajya kaa vistaar karnaa mushkil ho gaya
 Around the same time, unrest was brewing in Egypt
 misr ke rajyapal, kus ko yaad kiya gaya tha, or ali ne unhen mohammad ebn abi bakar ke saath badal diya tha
 Mu'awiyah allowed 'amrit ibn al' to conquer Egypt and Amrit successfully did so
 amrit ne pehle romanon se atharah saal pehle misr liya tha lekin uthman ne use barkhaast kar diya tha
 Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr had no popular support in Egypt and managed to reunite with 2000 men but they dispersed without fighting
 agle varshon main, muvayah kii sena ne iraq ke kai shaharon par kabja kar liya, jo ali ke governor nahin roak sake, or logon ne unke saath ladane ke liye unka samarthan nahin kiya
 Mu'awiyah defeated Egypt, Hijaz, Yemen and other regions
 ali ke khalipha ke aakhri saal main, kupha or basra main manodasha unke paksh main badal gaya kyonki log muvayah ke shasankaal or nitiyon se bhramit ho gaye
 However, people's attitude towards Ali was profoundly different
 unamem se keval ek choti alpsankhyak kaa maananaa tha ki ali mohammad ke baad sabase acha muslim tha or keval un par shashan karne kaa hakdaar tha, jabaki bahumat ne unhen muvayah ke avishvaas or virodh ke kaaran samarthan diya tha
 Ali is said to have sworn in and forewarned an inconsistent campaign against financial corruption and unfair privileges within the caliph's ranks after Uthman was pressed by the public to succeed in the caliphate
 shiyas kaa tark he ki abhijaat varg ke saath apni alokapriyata ke baavjood in sudhaaron ko dhakka dene main unka drudh sankalp amir or paigambar ke visheshadhikaar praapt purv saathi se shatruta kaa kaaran rahaa he
 In a famous letter to his governor Malik Ashtar, he expressed his pro-anti-poor attitude: yaad rakhen ki saamaanya purushon kii naapsand or asweekruti, mahatvapurn vyaktiyon kii sweekruti or kuch bade logon kii naaraazgi se adhik asantulan se adhik logon ko pareshaan nahin kiya jaataa he, yadi aapke vishay ke aam janata or jansampark aapke saath khush hai
 The common man, the poor, clearly the less important sections of your subjects are the pillars of Islam


 more friendly with them and securing their confidence and sympathy
 'ali ne uthman dwaara di gai bhoomi ko waapas laayaa or apane chunaav se pehle praapt hue kuch bhi hasil karne ke liye kasam khai
 Ali opposed the centralization of capital control over provincial revenue, favoring equal distribution of taxes and plunder among Muslim citizens; He distributed the entire revenue of the treasury among them
 'ali ne apane bhai' akel ebn abu talib sahit bhakthivaad se bachanaa
 This was a sign for Muslims of their policy of offering equality to Muslims, who served Islam in its early years and played a role in the subsequent conquest of Muslims
 ali ek vyapak gathbandhan banane main safal rahaa, khaskar oont kii ladaai ke baad 
 His policy of equal distribution of taxes and plunder gained the support of Muhammad's companions, especially the Ansar, who were subordinated by the Quraysh leadership after Muhammad, the traditional tribal leaders, and the Qur'a or Quranic readers who sought pious Islamic leadership
 
 is vividh gathbandhan kaa safal gathan ali ke karishmai charitra ke kaaran hota he
 This diverse coalition is known as Shia Ali, meaning "party" or "ali's faction"
 haalanki, shiya ke saath-saath gaiyr-shiya reporton ke mutabik, 'ali ne apane chunaav ke baad ali ko khalipha ke rup main samarthan dene ke liye samarthan diya, shahi raajnneetik rup se shahi the, dharmik rup se nahin
 Although many people at this time were counted as political Shiites, some of them believed in Ali's religious leadership

 Main article: Ali ibn Abi Talib and Alawi's descendants initially married Fatima, his dearest wife
 uski mrityu ke baad, vah phir se shaadi kar lee
 He had four children with Fatima, Hasan ibn Ali, Hussain ibn Ali, Zainab Bint Ali and Umm Kulthum Bint Ali
 unke anya jane-maane bete al-abbaas ebn ali the, jo fatima binate hijaam or mohammad ebn al-hanafiyah ke liye paidaa hue the
 Muhammad ibn al-hanafiyyah was from the Hanifa dynasty of central Arabia, another wife, Ali's son named Khawala bint Jafar
 fatima kii maut ke baad, ali ne bani hanipha janajati ke khawala bint jafar se vivaah kiya
 Hassan, born in 625, was the second Shia Imam and occupied the Khalifa's outward work for nearly six months
 varsh main eech 50 main vah apane ghar ke ek sadsy dwaara jehar or maar daalaa gaya tha, jaisaa ki itihaaskaaron dwaara jimmedaar tehraaya gaya tha, muaayah dwaara prerit kiya gaya tha
 Hussain, born in 626, was the third Shia Imam
 vah muaayah dwaara daman or utpeedan kii gambhir paristhitiyon main rahete the
 On the tenth day of Muharram of the year 680, he stood in front of the Khalifa's army with his small band of followers and nearly all were killed in the Battle of Karbala
 unki mrityu kii saalagirah aashura kaa din kaha jaataa he or yah shiya musalamaanon ke liye shok or dharmik anushthan kaa din he
 Some of Ali's other sons were killed in this battle

 The death of the last is suspected
 kuch itihaaskaaron ne ali ke anya putron ke naam jode hai, jo ibrahim, umr or abdllah ebn al-asakar samet karbala main maare gaye the
 His daughter Zainab — who was in Karbala — was captured by Yazid's army and later played a large role in revealing what happened to Hussein and his followers
 fatima dwaara ali ke vanshajon ko sharif, kahaniyaan yaa kahaniyon ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 These are venerable titles in Arabic, Sharif means 'great' and is said or said or 'god' or 'sir'
 mohammad ke ekmaatr vansh ke rup main, unhen sunni or shiya donon kaa sammaan kiya jaataa he
 Apart from Muhammad, there is no one in Islamic history that has been written in Islamic languages as Ali
 muslim samskruti main, ali ko unke saahas, gyaan, vishwaas, eemaandaaree, islam ke prati samarpan, mohammad ko gahari vafadari, sabhi musalamaanon ke samaan upachaar or parajeet dushmano ko kshamaa karne main udaartaa ke liye sammanit kiya jaataa he, or isliye rahasyamay paramparaon ke liye centre he islam main sufiwaad jaise
 Ali retains his stature as an authority on Quranic exegesis, Islamic jurisprudence and religious thought
 ali lagbhag sabhi sufi adeshon main ucch sthaan rakhata he jo unke madhyam se mohammad ko unke vansh kaa pataa lagaataa he
 Ali's influence has been significant throughout Islamic history
 sunni or shiya vidwaan is baat se sahamat hai ki vilaah kii kavita ali ke sammaan main sunai gai thi, lekin vilaayah or imamet kii alag-alag vyakhyaayein hai
 Sunni scholars believe that the poem is about Ali, but he is not identified as an Imam, in Shia Muslim thought, that Ali was chosen by God as Muhammad's successor
 ali yaa anya shiya imam kaa zikr karte hue shiya vidwaanon dwaara vyakhya kiye gaye kai chand hai
 Answering the question as to why the names of the Imams are not mentioned in the Quran, Muhammad al-baqir answers: "allah revealed salat to his Prophet but never said about the three or four rak'ahs, Revealed Zakat but did not mention its details Haj but its Tawaf and Prophet were not counted
 unhone is kavita kaa khulaasa kiya or paigambar ne kaha ki yah kavita ali, hasan, hossain or baarah imam ke bare main he
 "according to Ali a quarter of Quranic verses are telling the Imam's station
 mamen ne in chhandon main se kai ko shiya islam ke parichay main soochibaddh kiya he
 However, there are some verses that some Sunni commentators interpret in the context of Ali, among which Villah's verse that Sunni and Shiite scholars refer to the incident Ali gave his ring to a beggar who prayed rituals in the mosque Asked the devotees
 mavadda kii kavita chhandon main se ek he, donon sunni or shiyite ne ali ke naam ko kuch anya naamon ke saath joda
 The above verse of Mubhala, and also verse 2: 269 in which Ali is honored with unique knowledge by both Shia and Sunni commentators such verses
 shiya mohammad ke baad ali ko sabase mahatvapurn vyakti maanate hai or vah apni smriti main ek jatil, puranic vyakti kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 He is a paragon of virtues, such as courage, greatness, honesty, straightforwardness, eloquence and deep knowledge
 ali dharmi tha lekin anyaay kaa saamana karnaa padaa, vah aadhikarik tha lekin dayaalu or vinamr, joardaar lekin marij bhi, siikhaa lekin shramik vyakti bhi tha
 According to Shia, Muhammad suggested on various occasions during his lifetime that Ali should be the leader of Muslims after his death
 yah kai hadison dwaara samarthit he, jinhen shams dwaara sunaaya gaya he, jisamen khum ke talab ke haddees, do bharpurn chizon ke haddees, kalam or paper ke haddees, clok ke haddees, pad ke haddees, nimath ke nimantran kareebi parivaar, or baarah uttaradhikari ke haddees 
 Jafar al-sadiq narrates in the Hadith that whatever virtue found in Muhammad was found in Ali, who would turn away from Allah and his Prophet, under his guidance
 ali swayan varnan karata he ki vah allaah tak pahunchane ke liye pravesh dwaar or paryvekshak he
 According to this view, Ali as Muhammad's heir did not rule the community in justice, but also interpreted Sharia law and its esoteric meaning
 isliye unhen truti or paap se mukt mana jaataa tha, or mohammad ke madhyam se divya decri dwaara bhagwaan dwaara niyukt kiya gaya tha
 It is believed in Twelver and Ismaili Shi Islam that 'ekal was the source of divine wisdom, the spirits of the prophets and the Imams and was given esoteric knowledge called Goom and their sufferings were a means of divine grace to their devotees
 yadhyapi imam ek divya prakaashan kaa praptakarta nahin tha, phir bhi vah bhagwaan ke saath ghanishtha sambandh tha, jiske madhyam se bhagwaan use maargdarshan karata he, or imam badale main logon kaa maargdarshan karata he
 His words and deeds are a guide and model for the community; as a result it is the source of Sharia law
 shiya tirthayatri aamtaur par ziyaarat ke liye najaaf main mashad ali jate hai, vahaan prarthana karte hai or " ziyaarat amin allaah " yaa anya ziyaaratnanaam padhate hai
 Under the Safavid Empire, his tomb became the center of much devoted attention, exemplified by Shah Ismail i in his pilgrimage to Najaf and Karbala
 kai shiya muslim bhi imam ali kii jayanti ko pita diwas ke rup main manaate hai
 Gregory date changes every year for: mukhya lekh: ali ke sunni drishysunise ali ko chauthe khalipha ke rup main dekhte hai
 Ali is also known as one of the greatest warrior champions of Islam
 udaahranon main trench kii ladaai main kurish champion ko shaamil karnaa shaamil he jab kisi or ne dar nahin diya
 After several unsuccessful attempts to break the fort at the Battle of Khyber, Ali was summoned, miraculously recovered and the fort was conquered
 lagbhag sabhi sufi aadesh ali ke madhyam se mohammad ko apni vanshavali kaa pataa lagaate hai, jo abu bakar ke madhyam se jane vaale nakshabandi ke apwaad hai
 Even in this order, Ali's great great grandson is Jafar al-sadiq
 sufi kaa maananaa he ki ali ne mohammad se santrupt shakti vilaah se viraasat main pravesh kiya jo bhagwaan ko aadhyatmik yatra sambhav banaata he
 Like the famous Sufi Ali Huwiri claims that the tradition started with Ali and regarded the Junayd of Baghdad as the Ali Sheikh doctrines and practices of Sufiism
 suphis ne ali kii prashansa main maanakabat ali ko padhaa 
 Ali is recorded in some traditions as forbidden to those who sought to worship him in his lifetime
 jaise kuch samoohon Alawites vishwaas he ki ali parameshwar tha daawa kar rahe hai avatar
 He is described as Ghulat by the majority of Islamic scholars
 paramparaagat musalamaanon ke mutabik, in samoohon main islam chhod diya gaya he kyonki ve maanav ke prashansaneey gunon ke atvaad ke kaaran hai
 In ali-illahism, a syncretic belief has been consistently there at the religion centers incarnation of their deity throughout history, and reverence especially for Bhandar 'ali, the son of Muhammad, is considered one such incarnation
 druj, ek samadharmi dharm, maanate hai ki bhagwaan tha avatarit manushya main vishesh rup se, al-hakim bi-amr allaah ali ke vanshaj
 See also: Historiography of early Islam The primary sources for scholarship on the life of Ali are the Quran and Ahmadi, along with other texts of early Islamic history
 vyapak madhyamik sroton main, sunni or shia musalamaanon, isai arabon, hinduon or madhya purv or asia ke anya gaiyr-musalamaanon ke lekhan or aadhunik pashchimi vidwaanon dwaara kuch kaaryon ke alaava, shaamil hai
 However, some of the earliest Islamic sources are colored by a positive or negative bias towards Ali
 in kathanon ke khilaaf pehle pashchimi vidwaanon ke bich ek aam pravriti rahi thi or baad main sunni or shia pakshpatpurna padon kii pravriti ke kaaran baad kii avadhi main ekatrit reportein huin; baad main banaavat ke rup main unke bare main aise vidwaan
 This led him to consider some of the reported programs as informal or irrelevant

 Wilferd Madelung has rejected the stance of blindly dismissing everything not included in "early sources" and there is no evidence for a late origin to the trend alone in this approach
 unke anusaar, kaitani kaa drushtikon asangat he
 Madelung and some later historians do not reject narratives compiled in later periods and try to judge them in the context of history and on the basis of their compatibility with events and figures

 hazrat mohammad sahaab kaa yah safar tab shuru hua jab unke jivan ke do mahatvapurn log or us samay unke sabase bade samarthak is duniya se chhodkar ja chuke the
 One of them was his wife Khadija, and the other was his uncle Abu Talib
 yah mohammad sahab ke jivan kaa vah daur tha jab unhen kai samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha, jab unke apane kurash samaaj ke logon ne unka purna bahishkaar kar unhe samudaay se nishkasit kar diya tha
 Mecca is a city in the midst of a large desert in Saudi Arabia, in that time if the community had to expel a person, he had to spend his life on the desert land, due to which the person himself in the difficult environment of the desert He used to give up his life but even in such a difficult time of life, Hazrat Muhammad sahab's faith in God was never removed
 mana jaataa he ki al isra val meraaj vah raat he jab allaah kii taraf se ek khaas sawari bur bhejkar hazrat mohammad sahaab ko makka se jerusalem laayaa gaya tha
 But in today's time, this journey can be done in a few hours, and in that time it used to take at least two months to travel through the camel
 jerusalem pahunchakar hazrat mohammad sahab ne vahaan sthit al-aksa masjid main namaaj padhi or phir vahaan se shuru hua unka ek aadhyatmik safar jise meraaj kaha jaataa he
 In Meraj, Allah introduced Hazrat Muhammad to another world
 hazrat mohammad sahaab ke isi safar ke dauraan islam main ek din paanch main vakt ki namaaj padhanaa bhi anivaary kiya gaya tha

 The V6-powered Panamera has also been praised, as its small-size engine also maintains respectable acceleration and its handling is better than its smaller sister V8, as its engine is 100 Ib lighter due to the better delivery of the car 
 haalanki, sanyukt raashtra kii car magazine ne es model ko utana sporti nahin bataaya he jitna ki unhone apeksha kii thi, unhone aarope lagaaya he ki car "jahaan tak sambhav ho aaraam kii ore unmukh he"
 And called the Turbo model "a missed opportunity in relation to Porsche" which is "the world's first light weight four seater" since the top model weighs closer to the Audi S8

 The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a computer networking protocol used by devices that dynamically distribute IP addresses to the destination host
 oktober 1993 main RFC 1531 ne Bootstrap protocol ke pashchaat diechasipi ko ek maanak trek protocol ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he
 The next update, RFC 2131, released in 1997, is the current definition of DHCP for Internet Protocol version 4 networks
 diechasipi ke ipv6 ke liye ekstansion RFC 3315 main prakashit kiye gaye the
 BGP · DHCP · DNS · FTP · HTTP · IMAP · IRC · LDAP · MGCP · NNTP · NTP · POP · RIP · RPC · RTP · SIP · SMTP · SNMP · SOCKS · SSH · Telnet · TLS / SSL · XMPP · TCP · UDP · DCCP · SCTP · RSVP · ECN · IP · ICMP · icmpv6 · IGMP · ipsec · dianemic host kanfigareshan protocol ek yaa ek se adhik dosha sahishnu-diechasipi sarwar ke network upkarnon ke liye network-parameter ko swachaalit dhang se nirdhaarit karata he
 Even in small networks, DHCP is useful because it can make it easier to add new machines to the network
 jab ek diechasipi-configar client ek network se judata he, diechasipi client DHCP sarwar se aavashyak jaankaree ke liye ek prasaaran queri bhejtaa he
 The DHCP server collects a set of information about IP address and client configuration parameters such as default gateway, domain name, DNS server other servers such as time server, and others
 When a valid request is received, the server computer specifies an IP address, a lease, and other IP configuration parameters such as a subnet mask and default gateway
 aamtaur par booting ke turant baad queri kii shuruyaat ho jaati he or yah client dwaara anya host ke saath ypi aadhaarit sanchaar shuru hone se pehle puri honi chahie
 Depending on the implementation, DHCP servers can allocate IP in three ways: diechasipi IANA dwaara nirdisht unheen do port kaa prayog BOOTP ke liye karata he : sarwar said ke liye 67 / udp or client said ke liye 68 / udp
 There are four basic stages of DHCP operation: IP discovery, IP lease proposal, IP request and IP lease approval
 client physical sabanet par uplabdh diechasipi sarwar ko khojane ke liye sandesh prasaarit karata he
 Network administrators can configure a local router to forward DHCP packets from a different subnet to a DHCP server
 client dwaara kii gayi is kriya ke falswaroop 255
255
255
255 yaa vishisht sabanet prasaaran adress ke saath ek yuzar datagram protocol packet banataa he
 a DHCP client can also request for its previous known IP address
 yadi client us network se judaa rahata he jiske liye yah ypi vaid he, to sarwar anurodh sweekaar kar saktaa he
 Otherwise, it depends whether the server is set to authorized or not
 ek aadhikarik sarwar anurodh ko asweekaar kar degaa, jisase client turant ek nayaa ypi adress poochhega
 ek gaiyr aadhikarik sarwar anurodh ko keval andekha kar detaa he, jisase client ko ek nayaa anurodh bhejne or nayaa ypi adress poochne ke liye karyanvayan par nirbhar samay mil jaataa he
 Request subnet mask, router, domain name, jab ek diechasipi sarwar client se ek ypi leez kaa anurodh praapt karata he, yah client ke liye ek IP adress surakshit rakhata he or client ko ek diechasipigauteaish sandesh bhej kar ypi leez kii peshkash karata he
 This message contains the client's MAC address, the IP address offered by the server, the subnet mask, the duration of the lease, and the IP address of the server sending the offer
 sarwar CHADDR field main nirdisht client ke hardware adress ke aadhaar par concigareshan nirdhaarit karata he
 Here server 192
168
1
1 specifies the IP address in the YIADDR field
 ek client kai sarvaron se diechasipi prastaav praapt saktaa he, lekin yah keval ek diechasipi prastaav sweekaar karegaa or ek DHCP anurodh sandesh prasaarit karegaa
 Based on the transaction ID field in the request, the servers are notified whose proposal has been accepted by the client
 jab anya diechasipi sarwar yah sandesh praapt karte hai, ve client ko die gayi kisi bhi prastaav ko vaapis le sakate hai or prastaavit adress ko uplabdh ypi pool main bhej sakate hai
 When the DHCP server receives a DHCP REQUEST message from the client, the configuration process enters its final phase
 sweekruti charan main client ko ek diechasipithakh packet bheja jaataa he
 This packet contains the duration of the lease and other configuration related information the client may ask
 is bindu par, IP concigareshan prakriya puri ho jaati he
 The protocol expects DHCP clients to configure their network interfaces to conform to agreed standards
 client dwaara ek ypi adress praapt karne ke baad, diechasipi sarvaron dwaara adress bhandaran kii overlaping ke kaaran utpann ypi sambandhit bhidant se bachane ke liye, client adress rezolution protocol kaa prayog kar saktaa he
 a DHCP client may request more information in addition to the original DHCP OFFER information provided by the server
 client kisi vishesh aavedan ke liye data punah bhejne kaa anurodh bhi kar saktaa he
 For example, browsers use DHCP information to access web proxy settings via WPAD
 is tarah ke anurodhon se DHCP sarwar apane database main ypi samaapti samay ko rifresh nahin karata he
 The client sends a request to the DHCP server to issue DHCP information and the client deactivates / deactivates its IP address
 chunki client upkaran aam taur par yah nahin jaanate ki upyogkarta unhen network se kab hataa sakate hai, protocol diechasipi relies bhejne kaa samarthan nahin karata
 a DHCP server can provide optional configuration parameters for the client
 RFC 2132 internet asaind number othority - diechasipi or BOOTP parameter dwaara paribhaashit uplabdh DHCP vikalpon kaa varnan karata he
 a DHCP client can select, manipulate and override the parameters provided by the DHCP server
 vendor ko pahchaanane tathaa ek diechasipi client kii kaaryakshmata ko jaanane ke liye vikalp maujuud he
 The information can be in the form of character strings or octets of different lengths that are specified by the vendor of the DHCP client
 ek tarika jiskaa prayog diechasipi client, sarwar se sambandh sthapit karne ke liye karte hai, main ek vishesh prakaar ke hardware yaa formaware kaa prayog apane diechasipi anurodh main vailu set karne ke liye kiya jaataa he jise vendor class aidantifire kaha jaataa he
 This method enables the DHCP server to differentiate between the two types of client machines and properly execute requests from the two types of modems
 kuch tarah ke set-top box bhi diechasipi sarwar ko hardware ke prakaar or upkaran kii kaaryakshmata ke bare main suchit karne ke liye VCI ko set karte hai
 The value set by this option prompts the DHCP server to require any additional information that the client wants in a DHCP response
 chote network main diechasipi aamtaur par prasaaran kaa upyog karata he
 However, in some circumstances, a unicast address will be used, for example: when the network has a single DHCP server that provides an IP address for more than one subnet
 jab aise sabanet ke liye router ek diechasipi prasaaran praapt karata he, yah ise unicast main badal detaa he
 
 is sanshodhit anurodh kaa GIADDR field ko us router ke interphes par bheja jaataa he jis par isane mul diechasipi anurodh praapt kiya tha
 The DHCP server uses the GIADDR field to identify the subnet of the parent device so that it can select an IP address from the correct pool
 diechasipi sarwar iske baad diechasipi OFFER ko unicast ke madhyam se router par waapas bhejtaa he
 The router then converts DHCP OFFER into a broadcast and sends it to the interface of the original device
 saanchaa:close paraphrase The basic DHCP protocol has become a standard even before network security becomes an important issue: it does not include any security features and may result in two types of possible attacks: in khataron se nipatane ke liye RFC 3118 ne DHCP sandeshon main pramanikaran jaankaree shuru kii, jisane client or sarwar ko avaidh sroton se praapt hone vaali jaankaree ko asweekaar karne kii ijaajat di
 Although support for this protocol is widespread, a large number of clients and servers are still not fully supporting authentication, forcing servers to support clients that do not support this feature
 Huh
 parinamswaroop, anya suraksha upaay aamtaur par diechasipi sarwar main yah sunishchit karne ke liye lagu kiye jate hai ki keval pramanikrut client or sarwar kii hi network tak pahunch ho
 The addresses must be dynamically connected to the DNS server, so that the problem is resolved by name rather than by a potentially unknown address
 prabhavi diechasipi-dns link ke liye mike adress yaa sthaneey naam kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo us DNS ko bheja jaataa he jo physical host, ypi adress or duusare parameter jaise ki difolt getwe, sabanet mask or diechasipi sarwar se DNS sarwar ke ypi adress kii vishisht pahchaan karata he
 The DHCP server ensures that all IP addresses are different, meaning the IP address is not assigned to another client as long as the first client's assignment is valid
 Thus IP address pool management is done by a server and not by an administrator

 From the satisfaction of their food, both of them imagine the salvation of Budhia - if our soul is happy, will it not get happiness

 british sarkaar ne iskaa koi jawaab nahin diya
 In December 1929, the annual session of the Congress was held in Lahore in which Jawaharlal Nehru was elected President of the Congress Party

 The Kashmir issue and friendship with China proved to be paving the way in reaching an agreement with Pakistan

 This was a major setback for Nehru and perhaps his death was also the reason

 Many people think that Nehru contributed much less to the freedom struggle of India than other leaders, yet Gandhiji made him the first Prime Minister of India

 The plot stereotype is a small event based on reality, imagination or possibility, a fixed-molded business or an idea that starts the story in a similar situation, speeds up, gives a new twist or twist, ending the story in a magical way Used repeatedly to do or to compile the whole story in itself
 hajariprasad dvivedi ne kathanak roodhi ke bare main kaha he While defining the meaning, Shipley states, abhripay kii yah saamaanya paribhaasha he, kyonki vibhinn kalaroopon main iskaa vibhinn artho main prayog hota he or prayek kalaroop ke apane alag-alag abhipraay hote hai
 Therefore, it would be expedient to think about the intent here
 anek paramparaagat krity athwa niyam nirantar janvishwaas kaa sambal pate rahane ke kaaran chalan yaa roodhi maan liye jate hai
 No one knows their real meaning or original meaning, even on special occasions people follow them

 Experiments gradually become orthodox by taking the form of practice, yet their opinions remain articulate and are accepted only as certain specific traditional ideas from stereotypes
 kathanak roodhi sambandhi hajariprasad dvivedi kii upyukti paribhaasha main teen baaten kahi gai hai
 The first is that due to the emphasis on possibilities, storytellers are born
 is sandarbh main kaha ja saktaa he ki kathanak roodhiyon kaa prayog praaia: romaanch, chamatkaar tathaa puraakalin bimbon evam vaataavaran ko upasthit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, they include impossible, extraordinary, unnatural and sometimes supernatural elements
 par, in kathanak roodhiyon ke mul main sambhaavnashrith kalpana hi adhik kaam kar rahi hoti he
 For example, "flying by a demon or a demigod carrying a hero or heroine" is a reflection of the belief in the supernatural power
 pakshi kisi chote-mote jaanavar ko chonch main lekar ud saktaa he to parasaktidhaari yaksha yaa rakshas nayak athwa nayika ko uthaakar kyon nahin ud saktaa? kam se kam isaki sambhaavna to he hi, phir romaanch or chamatkarotpaadan ke liye kyon na iskaa upyog kar liya jaae
 Much of the story tradition finds its origin in the myths, folklore, Nishandari narratives and gathas that were formed on the basis of primitive beliefs, practices, rituals, ordinances, and tots
 parvarti kaal main yadhyapi saanskrithik parishkar ho jane par kuch kathanak abhipraay prachlan se pichad gaye athwa unke roopon main atyadhik parivartan ho gaya tathaapi, jaisaa nritatvashastreey shodhon se siddh ho chukaa he ki maanav unnat saanskrithik avasthaa main pahunch jane par bhi apni sabal dharnatmak shakti ke kaaran, aadim avasheshon ko tyaagane main asamarth rahata he–ye kathanak roodhiyaan, mithkon, lokkathaon, nisandhri aakhyaanon tathaa gaathaon main purvawat bani raheen or vahiin se shisht sahitya main gruhit hoti raheen
 New story conventions were also created with cultural uplift and sophistication
 yug-yug main jaise-jaise nae-nae reeti-rivaaj, manyataayen, vishwaas aadi sthapit hue, dharm, ayurveda, jyotish, shakun, tantramantra, kaam aadi se sambandhit shastron kaa nirmaan hua, vaise-vaise nai-nai kathanak roodhiyon ne bhi janm liya or loksahitya se lekar shisht sahitya tak main unka jamkar upyog hone laga, lagaataar hota rahaa
 The second sutra is- "these motifs are used to give speed and rotation to the plot
 ' kathanak main samay kii gati ghatnavali ko kholti chalati he or iske saath hi uskaa ghatana sangyojan, vishwa ke yuktiyukt sanghatan ke anuroop tarksangat kaary-kaaran-ant-sambandhon par aadhaarit rahata he
 The opening of this event in the story is meant to give momentum to the story, and the story intentions have a major hand in it
 udhaaharan ke liye, "upashruti' naamak abhipraay ko liya ja saktaa he
 When the protagonist wanders into the jungle in search of Priya, the path to pursue the story is also blocked

 In the context of twisting or turning the plot, "woman's double wish" can be taken
 "dohad' shabd kaa nirmaan "dwihrid' se hua he
 Apanasatva is the most common and familiar incident in the life of a woman
 is sthiti main aurat kabhi khatta meetha khaane kii ichha vyakt karti he to kabhi uskaa man chuulhe kii jali hui mitti khaane ke liye aatur ho uthta he
 The husband is ready to fulfill every wish of the pregnant wife and considers it her absolute duty to fulfill her twin wishes

 In many other legends too, to give a new twist to the narrative, the heroines are seen expressing desire to take chandrapan, to bathe in the blood of the husband or to bathe in any blood vessel
 nayak kritrim raktavapi banavaakar priya ko usamen snaan karwaata he
 On exiting the Vapi, the bloodied woman from top to bottom takes a bhurund, eagle, or vulture fleshy hovering in the sky and presses it into the beak

 Somewhere a demon encounters, somewhere a minister has to deal with it and eventually he finds a wife

 Not only here, enough help is taken from these plot ideas to start and end the story in a miraculous manner
 koi hans athwa shuk nayak ke haath lag jaataa he or kisi sundari kaa rupagun varnan karke use prematur bana detaa he
 The hero sets out in Yogishiva to get the girlfriend
 is prakaar katha kaa suprarambh hota he jo uttarottar kautuhalapurna evam jigyasapurna banataa jaataa he
 In order to end the story, many times, in the absence of the protagonist, a kuttani is sent to the heroine on behalf of a man or a prince or prince
 kintu nayika sat se nahin digti
 When the hero returns, he narrates the incident to which the hero sets fire to the opponent and is so wounded in killing the enemy in the Samragana that even his own life is not saved and the heroine becomes sati with her dead body
 is
 par-kaay-pravesh aadi kuch abhipraayon main sampurna katha kaa sanghatan karne kii kshamta bhi rahati he
 The third sutra is derived from Dwivedi ji's above statement that "these meanings that are practiced over a long period of time are a little far from the reality and are later converted into plot stereotypes
 ' prastut panktiyon ko sarsari taur par dekhne se aisa abhas hota he ki "kathanak abhipraay' or "kathanak roodhi' bhinnarthak hai
 But at the slightest penetration, this confusion becomes disjointed, because in the beginning any intention is used for a particular purpose and while doing so there must be some amount of reality at the root of the said intention
 pashchaat kalpana ke sangyojan se ukt abhipraay ko uttarottar aisa rup miltaa chalaa jaataa he ki usamen vishwasiya tatv kii maatra paryaapt viral ho jaati he parantu uskaa sambhaavnapaksh abhi bhi paryaapt mukhar rahata he or rachayitavarg satyasty anveshan se nirpeksh rahakar apni anukaranpravriti ke kaaran uparyukt avasaron par abhisht prayojanarth uskaa prayog karata hi rahata he
 At this stage, the plot intent turns into a plot stereotype, but it does not mean that the plot stereotype remains a mere stereotype
 kathanak abhipraay ke samaan hi kathanak roodhi kaa bhi abhipraayapaksh purnroopen sakriy rahata he, katha yaa aakhyaan ko aage badhaane, use koi naveen mode dene yaa chamatkaarik dhang se samaapt karne kii uski kshamta main koi antar nahin padataa
 In this view, these two are synonymous with each other
 "kathanak abhipraay' ko "kathanak roodhi' naam dene main taatpary keval itnaa rahata he ki isse yah bhi spasht ho jaae ki iskaa prayog chalan yaa parampara ke aadhaar par bhi kiya gaya rahata he
 For example, there is evidence of sending a message to the beloved or Priya by tying a letter in the foot or cervix of goose, capot, shook etc
 at: aarambh main kathakaron ne yathavat ise abhipraay ke rup main prayukt kiya hoga
 Later, by virtue of Shukadi's ability to emulate a little human, many birds began to be shown as the original messengers in human language
 itnaa hi nahin, aage chalakar unhen shastrajna, mukhar pandit or paramarshdaata ke rup main prayukt kar lene main bhi hichkichaahat na rahi
 The "hiraman" is a proof of Padmavat's well-known claim
 nishkarshat:, aarambh main yatharth rahane par bhi "sandeshwah pakshi' naamak abhipraay deergh kaal tak vyavahrut hote rahane ke baad na keval yatharth se dur hi chalaa gaya apitu uskaa prayog bhi har premi premika ke bich sandeshvahak, premsanghatak, morganirdeshak aadi ke rup main baar-baar kiya jane laga
 The same is true for all other ideas
 prayog sambandhi is roodhi kaa paalan karne ke kaaran hi "kathanak abhipraay' ko "kathanak roodhi' kah lene main koi anauchity nahin rah jaataa
 Story stereotypes where the plot is unable to move or rotate or end in a miraculous manner, etc
, it will be called a storyline or a mere stereotype, not a storyline stereotype
 udhaahranswaroop nur mohammad krit indravati ke purvardh main indravati se vivaah karne ke liye samudr se moti nikaal laane kaa anubandh "kathanak roodhi' he kyonki usee ko puraa karne jane ke kaaran rajkunvar ko durjanray kaa bandi bananaa padaa or buddhasen tathaa indravati donon ne praytn karke krupa naamak raja ke dwaara durjanray kaa naash karwaakar rajkunvar ko kaid se mukt karavaaya
 The narrative also expanded and got a new twist
 lekin rasratan main aisi koi shart na rahane se swayamvar main rambha surasen kaa sidhe varan kar leti he
 The story does not get any momentum from it nor any kind of rotation or expansion
 at: yahan swayamvar yaa vivaah ek katharoodhi yaa roodhi bhar he jiskaa aayojan keval katha ke kalanukramik varnan ko vyavasthit rakhane ke liye hi kiya gaya he
 The storyline stereotype or plot intent is purely related to the object or structure of the story
 lekin kavy abhipraay isse bilkul bhinn katha yaa kavy ke abhivyakti paksh se sambandhit hote hai
 The stereotypes built on the basis of analogy are also related to the expression side but their function is only to make sense or sentiment based on analogy
 nagar, upavan, ashram, nakhsikh, rituvarnan, baramasa aadi varnanaatmak yaa niyam sambandhi roodhiyaan bhi katha yaa kavy ke bahyakaar se sambandh rakhti hai
 But these are only poetry or can be called narratives, and they cannot be presented with the kind of cues that have the potential to reflect a lot through poetic motifs or plot ideas
