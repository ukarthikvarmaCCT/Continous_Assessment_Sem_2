 yangs dabl slit pareekshan, aadhunik dabl slit pareekshan kaa mul rup he
 This experiment was demonstrated in the 19th century by Thomas Young
 is prayog ne prakaash kii tarang siddhant kii sweekruti main ek pramukh bhoomika nibhaai he
 Thomas Young himself said that this was the most important achievement of all his achievements
 is avadhi ke dauraan kai vaigyanikon jaise robert hook, chrishchiyan huygens tathaa leonard oiller, ne prayogtmak tippaniyon ke aadhaar par prakaash ke tarang siddhant ke kain prastaav rakhe
 However, Sir Isaac Newton, who conducted several experimental investigations on light, rejected the wave theory of light and developed the corpuscles of light, according to which light from any luminous body is emitted as small particles and in the same form Is broadcast in newton kaa yah siddhant vivartan jaise kai pratyaksh prasango kii vyakhya nahin kar saktaa
 Nevertheless, there were many eminent supporters of this theory such as Pierre Simon Laplace and Jean Baptiste Beyt
 san 1800 main gautingen main aushadhiy vigyaan kaa adhyayan karte hue, yang ne royal sosayadi ke saamne ek patr prastut kiya jisme yang ne tark diya ki prakaash bhi tarang kii tarah vyavhaar karata he
 This idea of young was viewed with some degree of skepticism as it contradicted Newton's corpuscles
 baharhaal, vah nirantar apane siddhant ko viksit karata rahaa
 He described the properties of those waves, using water waves
 san 1801 me unhone royal sosayadi ke samaksh "on da theori off lit and color" naamak ek thisis prastut kiya
 Young gave an analysis of various in this handout
 dabl- slit prayog ek pradarshan he jiske prakaar prakaash tathaa baat donon tarangon or kanon ke roopak vyavhaar kar saktaa he
 Furthermore, it demonstrates the fundamental "probabilistic nature" of quantum mechanical phenomena
 is prayog me ek susangat prakaash strot, ek thali main do samanaantar chhedon ko prakashit karata he
 The light passing through these holes is inspected on a screen behind
 dono chhedon se nikasit prakaash ke bich sampark ke kaaran, screen par ujjwal tathaa andhere band utpaadit hote he
 If light is made up of particles, then the pattern of these bands makes no sense
 isse pataa lagata he ki prakaash tarango kii tarah vyavhaar karata he
 But some experiments, such as photoelectric effect, suggest that light behaves like particles
 ise prakaash kaa "tarang-kan dwaitata" kaha jaataa he
 Along with light, many other non-non-particles like electrons also have these properties
 is prayog kaa ek mahatvapurn sanskaran ekala kanon kaa bhi istamaal karata he, jaise ki electron
 In this experiment a machine is used which throws electron particles towards the screen
 yah mashin ek pistol kii tarah kaam karata he
 Electron particles pass through two parallel holes
 chhedon se guzar kar yah electron ek screen par ja girte he
 As this screen is a photographic film, we have to see the electron fall on it
 is prayog ko karne ke paschaat dekha gaya ki screen par usee tarah ke ujjwal tathaa andhere bandon kaa nirmaan hua, jaise prakaash par yah prayog karne se hua tha
 This experiment can be done on many other particles and sub-particles including electrons and the pattern of the same bands can be shown every time
 kwantum yantric siddhant ke anusaar in kanon kaa screen ke vibhinn bhaagon par girnaa ek apratyaashit prakriya he
 When and where the particle will fall, it cannot be guessed
 agar do tarang ki tarah vyavhaar karne vaale kan ek dusre ko radd kar den, to iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki kan gaayab ho jaataa he ; iskaa matlab yah he ki kan kahin or dikhaai degaa
 The Copenhagen Explanation is a theory in the field of quantum mechanics, created by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg

 According to this interpretation, the properties of any system, before measuring, are not definite

 Sarvodaya is a book translated into Gujarati by Gandhiji, a book by the English writer Ruskin
 'antu da last' kaa arth he - is antavaale ko bhi
 Sarvodaya means the rise of all, the development of all
 sarvoday bharat kaa purana adarsh he
 Our sages have sung- "survey Sukhin: Santu"
 sarvoday shabd bhi nayaa nahin he
 Jain monk Samantabhadra says - Sarvapadamantakaram Nirantam Sarvodayam Tirthamidam Tawaiv
 "sarv khalvidan brahm", "vasudaiv kutunbakan", athwa "soham" or "tatvamasi" ke hamaare puraatan aadarshon main "sarvoday" ke siddhant antarnihit hai
 Sarvodaya Samaj was a society of Gandhi's imagination, with the Indian village system at its center
 vinoba ji ne kaha he, sarvoday kaa arth he - sarvaseva ke madhyam se samast praaniyo kii unnati
 We can see the practical nature of Sarvodaya for a very long time in Vinoba's Bhoodan movement
 subahavaale ko jitna, shamwale ko bhi utana hi-pratham vyakti ko jitna, antim vyakti ko bhi utana hi, isamen samanta or advait kaa vah tatv samaaya he, jisapar sarvoday kaa vishaal prasaad khadaa he
 1 self-restraint 2 shoshanheen samaaj 3 all-round development 4 lokaneeti ke aadhaar par shashan 5 decentralization of power "sarvoday" kaa adarsh he advait or uski niti he samanvay
 He wants to end humanized inequality and reduce natural inequality
 jeevamaatr ke liye samaadar or prayek vyakti ke prati sahanubhuti hi sarvoday kaa maarg he
 When this unconquerable flow of sympathy for the living, flows in life, then the lush of Sarvodaya blossoms into a beautiful Suman
 darwin ne kaha-"prakruti kaa niyam he, badi machhlee choti machhlee ko khaakar jivit rahati he
 "huxley said — live and let live
 " sarvoday kahata he-"tum dusron ko jilane ke liye jio
 "to make others yours, love has to expand, non-violence will develop, and end the exploitation and change today's social values
 " "sarvodaya" seeks to establish a classless, casteless and exploitative society in which every individual and group gets the means and opportunities for their all-round development
 vinoba kehete hai-"jab ham sarvoday kaa vichaar karte hai, tab oonch-neech bhaavshaalee varnavyavastha diwaar kii tarah samaane khadi ho jaati he
 Sarvodaya will not be installed without breaking it
 sarvoday ko safal banane ke liye jatibhed mitaanaa hoga or aarthik vishmata dur kerani hogi
 Sarvodaya society will be created only by erasing them
 " "sarvodaya wants such a structure
 Gym should not be destroyed or boycotted by any community on the basis of varna, class, religion, caste, language etc
 sarvoday kii samaajarachna aisi hogi, jo sarv ke nirmaan or sarv kii shakti se sarv ke hit main chale, jisamen kam yaa adhik shaareerik samathrya ke logon ko samaaj kaa sangrakshan samaan rup se praapt ho or sabhi tulya paarishramik ke hakdaar maane jaaen
 In this era of science and democracy, the revolution has the value of everything and it is the standard of all development
 sarv kii kranti main poonji or buddhi main paraspar sangharsh kii gunjaaish nahin he
 They are mutually complementary powers at the same level
 swabhaavat: sarvoday kii samaajarachna main antim vyakti samaaj kii chintaa kaa sabase pehle adhikari he
 Sarvodaya Samaj can be created only on the purification of personal life
 jo vrath niyam vyaktigat jivan main "mukti" ke saadhan hai ve hi jab saamaajik jivan main bhi vyavahrut honge, tab sarvoday samaaj banegaa
 Vinoba says- "the society that will be created from the point of view of Sarvodaya will have to start with its life
 nijee jivan main asaty, hinsa, parigrah aadi hua to sarvoday nahin hoga, kyonki sarvoday samaaj kii vishmata ko ahimsa se hi mitaanaa chahta he
 The aim of the communist is also to remove asymmetry, but for this good purpose, whatever means one can use, but for Sarvodaya, means of purification are also necessary
 " Gandhiji also says- "socialism starts with socialist first
 agar ek bhi aisa samaajawaadee ho, to usapar shunya badaye ja sakate hai
 Every zero will increase its value tenfold, but if the first digit is zero, then how many zeros are increased before it, its value will still remain zero
 " That is why Gandhiji used to emphasize truth, non-violence, astheya, aparigraha, celibacy, taste, bodywork, fearlessness, sarvadharma samvayya, untouchability and observance of Swadeshi etc
 paarishramik kii samanta - jitna vetan nai ko utana hi vetan vakil ko
 This element of "unto This Last" is fully accepted in Sarvodaya
 samyawad bhi paarishramik main samanta chahta he
 This element is the same in both
 pratiyogita kaa abhaav - pratiyogita sangharsh ko janm detii he
 For communists, the struggle is the ultimate element
 parantu sarvoday sangharsh ko nahin, sahakaar ko maanata he
 There is violence in conflict
 sarvoday kaa sara bhawan hi ahimsa kii neenv par khadaa he
 Instrumentation - Communism does not consider instrumentation necessary for the attainment of the practicable
 sarvoday main sadhanshuddhi pramukh he
 The practicable is also pure and the means pure
 anuvanshik sanskaron se laabh uthaane ke liye trustiship kii yojana - vinoba kehete hai-""sampatti kii vishmata kritrim vyavastha ke kaaran paidaa hui he, aisa maanakar use chhod bhi den, to manushya kii shaareerik or bauddhik shakti kii vishmata puri tarah dur nahin ho sakati
 This disparity can be reduced to some degree by teaching and regulation
 kintu adarsh kii sthiti main is vishmata ke sarvatha abhaav kii kalpana nahin kii ja sakati
 Therefore, whoever gets the body, intelligence and property of these three, should understand that he has got it for everyone's benefit
 yahi trustship kaa bhav he
 As a trustee, you should use your power and property for the benefit of mankind
 trustiship main aparigrah kii bhaavana nihit he
 There is no place for heredity in communism
 uski niti to abhijatya ke sanhaar kii rahi he
 Decentralization - Sarvodaya wants decentralization of power and property so that exploitation and suppression can be avoided
 kendrikrut audyogikaran ke is yug main to yah or bhi aavashyak ho gaya he
 When this process of decentralization is applied in the matter of power, then it results in a rule-free society
 samyavaadee kii kalpana main bhi rajasatta tej garmi main rakhe hu ghi kii tarah ant main pigal janevaali he
 But before that he should be solid and strong, not just like frozen ghee, but like a hammer struck on Trotsky's head
 
 But Gandhiji has spoken of decentralization and de-independence in all three, middle and end situations
 yahi sarvoday kaa maarg he
 Currently, two methods of ownership of the means of production are prevalent in the world - private ownership and government ownership
 nijee swaamitv poonjeewaad he, sarkaar swaamitv samyawad
 There is exploitation in capitalism, repression in communism
 bharat kii parampara, uski pratibha or uski paristhiti, teenon kii maang he ki vah raajnneetik or aarthik sanghathan kii koi teesri hi paddati viksit kare, jisase poonjeewaad ke "nijee abhikram" or samyawad ke "samuhik hit" kaa laabh to mil jaae, kintu unke dosha se bachaa ja sake
 In Gandhiji's elaborate scheme of "trusteeship" and "gramswarajya" and Vinoba's "gramdan-gram Swarajaya" based on this imagination, both the faults are avoided and the properties are used
 yahan swaamitv na nijee he, na sarkaar kaa, balki gaanv kaa he, jo swytt he
 In this way, this revolution of Sarvodaya is presenting a new system to the world

 The Muslim League said that it works in the interest of Muslim minorities
 raaje-rajavaadon kaa daawa tha ki congress kaa unke niyantran vaale bhubhag par koi adhikaar nahin he
 The third challenge was from the fast-paced lawyer and thinker BR Ambedkar, who said that Gandhiji and the Congress Party did not represent the lower castes

 The fort of Toran was 30 kilometers southwest of Poona

 uski sena kaa kuch bhaag bhi shivaji maharaj kii seva main aa gaya
 At the same time, the fortress of Purandar died and a fight broke out between his three sons for the succession of the fort
 do bhaaiyon ke nimantran par shivaji maharaj purandar pahunche or kootneeti kaa sahaara lete hue unhone sabhi bhaaiyon ko bandi bana liya
 In this way, his authority was also established on the fort of Purandar

 bijapur ke do saradaaron kii madhyasthata ke baad shahaji maharaj ko is shart par mukt kiya gaya ki ve shivaji maharaj par lagaam kasenge
 For the next four years, Shivaji Maharaj did not launch an attack against Bijipur

 Shivaji Rajane did not invade the areas of Bijapur according to the conditions of Salvation of Shahaji, but he tried to increase his power in the south-west

 Shivaji had both Bijapur and Mughal enemies
 us samay shahzada aurangzeb dakkan kaa soobedaar tha
 At the same time, Sultan Adilshah of Bijapur died on 1 November 1656, after which an atmosphere of chaos arose in Bijapur
 is sthiti kaa laabh uthaakar aurangzeb ne bijapur par akraman kar diya or shivaji ne aurangzeb kaa saath dene kii bajaay usapar dhaava bol diya
 His army attacked Junnar city and looted 200 horses with a lot of wealth
 ahmednagar se 700 ghode, chaar hathi ke alaava unhone gunda tathaa racin ke durg par bhi lutpaat machaai
 As a result, Aurangzeb was upset with Shivaji and the friendship negotiations ended

 Aurangzeb migrated to North India as soon as he was afflicted and became the Shah of the Mughal Empire after imprisoning Shah Jahan there

 After Aurangzeb returned to Agra, the Sultan of Bijapur also breathed a sigh of relief

 Shahaji was already asked to keep his son under control but Shahaji showed his inability to do so
 shivaji se nipatane ke liye bijapur ke sultan ne abdullah bhatari ko shivaji ke viruddh bheja
 Afzal traveled in 1659 with 120,000 soldiers
 tulajapur ke mandiron ko nasht karata hua vah satara ke 30 kilometre uttar vaai, shirval ke najadik tak aa gaya
 But Shivaji stayed on the fort of Pratapgarh
 afjal khan ne apane doot krishnaji bhaskar ko sandhi-vaarta ke liye bheja
 He sent a message through him that if Shivaji accepts the subjugation of Bijapur, the Sultan will give him the right to all the areas which are under Shivaji's control
 saath hi shivaji ko bijapur ke darbar main ek sammanit pad praapt hoga
 Though Shivaji's minister and advisor was in favor of As Sandhi, Shivaji did not like these talks
 unhone krishnaji bhaskar ko uchit sammaan dekar apane darbar main rakh liya or apane doot gopinath ko vastusthiti kaa jayja lene afjal khan ke paas bheja
 From Gopinath and Krishnaji Bhaskar, Shivaji felt that Afzal Khan wanted to imprison Shivaji by plotting a treaty
 atah unhone yuddh ke badale afjal khan ko ek bahumoolya uphaar bheja or is tarah afjal khan ko sandhi vaarta ke liye raji kiya
 Both of them had ambushed their soldiers at the place of peace, when the two met at the place of meeting, Afzal Khan attacked Shivaji with his Katiyar, in defense, Shivaji killed Afzal Khan with his clothes
 afjal khan kii mrityu ke baad shivaji ne panhala ke durg par adhikaar kar liya
 After this, along with taking control of the fortifications of Pawangarh and Vasantgarh, he also failed the attack of Rustom Khan

 Now an atmosphere of terror had arisen in Bijapur and the feudals there, forgetting mutual differences, decided to attack Shivaji

 Shivaji was in trouble, but taking advantage of the darkness of the night, he managed to escape
 bijapur ke sultan ne swayan kaman samhaalkar panhala, pavangadh par apana adhikaar waapas le liya, rajapur ko lut liya or shringargarh ke pradhan ko maar daalaa
 At the same time, due to the revolt of Siddijauhar in Karnataka, the Sultan of Bijapur entered into an agreement with Shivaji
 is sandhi main shivaji ke pita shahji ne madhyasthata kaa kaam kiya
 According to this treaty in 1662, Shivaji was recognized as an independent ruler by the Sultan of Bijapur

 He looted in Maval for 3 years

 Shaista managed to escape through the window but had to wash her hands with her four fingers in this sequence

 After this incident Aurangzeb made Shaista the Subedar of Bengal instead of Deccan and Shahzada Muazzam was sent to replace Shaista

 Six years later, Shaista Khan destroyed King Shivaji's entire Mulukh with his 15 xxrep 4 0 army

 Shivaji looted the wealthy merchants of Surat for six days in 1664 with an army of four thousand
 aam aadmi ko unhonen nahin lutaa or phir laut gaye
 The Dutch and the British have mentioned this incident in their articles

 Until Nadir Shah invaded India, no European power thought of attacking the Indian Mughal Empire

 In this war, Shivaji started to suffer loss and seeing the possibility of defeat, Shivaji sent a proposal for a treaty
 june 1665 main hui is sandhi ke mutabik shivaji 23 durg mughalon ko de denge or is tarah unke paas keval 12 durg batch jaayenge
 The income from these 23 fortifications was 4 lakh Huns annually

 Apart from this, they will also give revenue of 5 lakh Huns every year
 shivaji swayan aurangzeb ke darbar main hone se mukt rahenge par unke putr shambhaji ko mughal darbar main khidamat kerani hogi
 Shivaji will support the Mughals against Bijapur
 shivaji ko agra bulaayaa gaya jahaan unhen laga ki unhen uchit sammaan nahin mil rahaa he
 Against this, he showed his fury in the court and accused Aurangzeb of betrayal
 aurangzeb isse kshubdh hua or usne shivaji ko nazarkaid kar diya or unpar 5000 sainikon ke pehre laga diye
 Aurangzeb intended to kill King Shivaji a few days later
 lekin apane ajod saahas ore yukti ke saath shivaji or sambhaaji donon isse bhaagane main safal rahe
 Shivaji Maharaj went to Banaras after leaving Sambhaji in Mathura with a believing Brahmin, went to Puri and went safely to Rajgarh

 Aurangzeb suspected Jaisingh and got him murdered by poisoning him

 Aurangzeb recognized Shivaji as the king

 After the establishment of an independent Hindu nation in western Maharashtra, Shivaji wanted to crown his coronation, but Muslim soldiers threatened the Brahmins that whoever crowned Shivaji would be killed
 When this thing reached Shivaji that the Mughal Sardar is making such threats, then Shivaji took it as a challenge and said that now he will get anointed from the Brahmin of that state who is in the authority of the Mughals
 Shivaji's personal secretary Balaji sent three emissaries to Kashi, because Kashi was under the Mughal Empire
 When the messengers gave the message, the Brahmins of Kashi were quite pleased
 But the Mughal soldiers came to know about this and then caught those Brahmins
 But wisely those Brahmins told those messengers in front of the Mughal sannyko that we do not know who Shivaji is
 What line are they from? The messengers did not know that is why they said we do not know
 Then in front of the Sardar of the Mughal soldiers, those Brahmins said that we have to go somewhere else, from which clan Shivaji you have not told, so how can we crown him
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back
 The Mughal Sardar was happy and left the Brahmins and thought of catching the messengers and sending them to Aurangzeb to Delhi, they too escaped silently
 After returning, he told this thing to Balaji Awa and Shivaji
 But surprisingly after two days the same Brahmin reached Raigad with his disciples and crowned Shivaji

 aurangzeb ne dakshin main atehi adilshaahi 2 dino main ore qutubashhi 1 hi dino main khatam kar di
 But the Marathas, under the leadership of King Sambhaji, maintained their independence while fighting for 9 years
 aurangzeb ke putr shahjada akbar ne aurangzeb ke kilaaf vidroh kar diya
 Sambhaji gave him shelter in his place
 aurangzeb ne ab phir joardaar tareeke se sambhaji ke kilaaf akraman karnaa shuru kiya
 Finally, in 1689, Sambhaji's wife's brother, Sambhaji, by the mouth of Ganji Shirke, made Sambhaji a prisoner by Mukarav Khan
 aurangzeb ne raja sambhaji se badasluki kii or bura haal kar ke maar diya

 bhushan kii veerabhaavana kaa varnan bahuaiami he
 We can see it in the forms of war-like, religious-minded, charity-oriented, eulogistic, etc
 vir ras ke sthaayee bhav utsaah kaa utkrisht rup yubhumi main shatru ko lalkaarte hue ujagar hota hai shivaji swany vir the or unki prerana se hindu sainikon ke man main veerta kaa bhav utpann hua tha
 Describing the bravery of those soldiers, Bhushan said: bhushan kaa yuddh varnan bada hi sajiv or swaabhaavik he
 The battle depiction of the armies with the fervor of war, the roar of the war eagles, the ambush of weapons in the battlefield, the valor of the valiant heroes and the frightening position of the cowards, etc
 are depicted in a very impressive manner
 shivaji kii sena kaa ran ke liye prasthaan karte samay kaa ek chitra dekhie - The poet has inscribed Shivaji as the icon of religion and culture
 shivaji ne musalamaanon se takkar lee tathaa hinduon kii raksha kii
 The poet has said in Shivabavani: - vir ras ke kaviyon ne apane nayak ko atyadhik daanveer dikhalaayaa he
 Bhushan has made an exaggerated description of Shivaji's charity
 pachak ko apni ichha se zyada daan miltaa he
 In Shivastuti, the poet describes Shivaji's uncommon charity
 bhushan ke anusaar, shivaji dayaa ke sagar hai
 He took pity on refugees
 unhone apane sainikon ko striyon va bacchon ko tang na karne kaa nirdesh diya hua tha
 In fact, Bhushan has effectively described Shivaji's might, valor and terror
 unhone shivaji ke dharmarakshak, daanveer va dayavan, rup ko prakat kiya he
 The posts related to his Virus are free
 inamen ojagun kaa nirvaah he
 Poets of other heroic Rasa of Hindi also describe Shringar
 jabaki bhushan kaa kavy shringaar bhaavana se bachaa hua he
 Therefore, it can be said that Bhushan is the best poet of Virus
 bhushan ne apane kavy kii rachana braj bhashaa main kii
 He is the first poet who adopted the Braj language for the poetry of Veer Ras
 vir ras ke anukool unki braj bhashaa main sarvatra hi aaj ke darshan hote hai
 The Braj language of Bhushan is full of words in Urdu, Arabic, Persian etc
 jang, aafatab, fuj aadi shabdon kaa khul kar prayog hua he
 The choice of words suits Veer Ras
 muhaavaron or lokoktiyon kaa prayog sundarataa se hua he
 Despite the chaos of grammar, distortion of words, disturbance of syntax, etc
, Bhushan's language is very powerful and fluent
 haa, praakrit or apbhransh ke shabd prayukt hone se vah kuch clisht avashya ho gai he
 Bhushan's style suits his subject
 vah ospurn he or vir ras kii vyanjana ke liye sarvatha upyukt he
 Hence, his style can be called the complete style of Veer Ras
 prabhavotpaadakta, chitropamata or sarasata bhushan kii style kii mukhya visheshtaayen hai
 '=== Ras === Bhushan is a unique poet in Hindi literature in his description of Veer Ras of Bhushan's poem
 vir ke saath raudra bhayanak-vibhats aadi rason ko bhi sthaan mila he
 Bhushan has also written some poems about Shringar Ras, but the description of Shringar Ras also has a clear effect on his heroic Ras and interest - bhushan kii chand yojana ras ke anukool he
 Doha, Kavitta, Savaiya, Chappay etc
 are his major verses
 reeti kaaleen kaviyon kii bhaanti bhushan ne alankaaron ko atyadhik mahatv diya he
 Almost all the ornaments are found in his poetry
 arthalankaron kii apeksha shabdalankaron ko pradhanta mili he
 See an example of pun ornament
 bhushan rashtriya bhaavon ke gayak he
 His speech is a rare assurance to the suffering subjects
 inkaa samay aurangzeb kaa shashan tha
 From the time of Aurangzeb, the hold of Mughal splendor and power was getting weaker
 aurangzeb kii katurataa va hinduon ke prati nafrat ne use janata se dur kar diya tha
 In this hour of crisis, Bhushan tried to spread the national sentiment through two national men - Shivaji and Chhatrasal
 bhushan ne tatkaaleen janata kii vaani ko apni kavitaaon kaa aadhaar banaaya he
 He has described self-respect, culture, beauty, literature, beauty, passion for great men, enthusiasm, etc
 bhushan kaa apane desh ke prati gaharaa lagaav tha
 His vision was on the whole country
 unhone dekha ki aurangzeb devalayon ko nasht kar rahaa he to unka man vidroh kar uthaa
 Through Shivaji, he expressed his voice - bhushan ne samskruti kaa upyog hinduon ko khoyaa hua bal dilaane ke liye kiya
 He mentioned the works of many deities and has counted Shivaji's works in the category of those great works
 shivaji kaa dharm va samskruti ke unnayak rup main ankit kiya gaya he- Bhushan has studied Vedasastras deeply
 inhone pracheen sahitya ke aadhaar par hi apane kavy kii rachana kii unka sahitya prem unki rashtriya bhaavana kaa parichaayak he
 Bhushan has expressed reverence for great men and public heroes of the past and present
 inhone shivaji or chhatrasaal bundela yaa anya koi paatr sabhi kaa ullekh keval unheen prasangon main kiya he jo rashtriya bhaavana se sambandhit the
 like : rashtriya sahitya main chetana kaa bhav hota he
 There is a sense of liveliness, vitality and zeal in Bhushan's literature
 mughalon ke saath shivaji ke sangharsh kaa kavi utsaahpurn style main varnan kiya haih- Undoubtedly, Bhushan's poetry is full of national consciousness
 ve sachche arthon main rashtriya bhaavana ke kavi hai
 Bhushan has a special place in Hindi literature
 ve vir ras ke adwitiya kavi the
 He was the first of the poets who gave prominence to nationalism over haas-vilas
 unhone apane kavy dwaara tatkaaleen asahaay hindu samaaj kii veerta kaa paath padhaayaa or uske samaksh raksha ke liye ek adarsh prastut kiya
 They are undoubtedly the immortal heritage of the nation

 The dimensions of his creative and conversational genius were discussed for three days

 a book in Hindi was also added to the findings of the seminar, titled 'avayya: a Prolific Contribution of Acharya Govind Chandra Pandey' 2005, but it did not even have a complete picture of his work, because its face is very broad

 The translations were different
 " "deep knowledge of philosophy, history and Sanskrit, it was natural for the texts to be written by him, with a deep sense of maturity, a tendency to speak in a nutshell

 " "buddha darshan or buddhakalin bharat par inke granth sarvotkrisht maane jate hai
 He also had authority over astrology

 i was in close contact with him when this book was being written, because he was well-known for his interest that a national seminar was held on his birthday in Allahabad museum on some subject of the country's top menis while living in Allahabad
 
 mujh jaise adhakachare ko bhi ye avashya bulaate the
 i had suggested the title of this book 'vedic Varamaya', but why they named it 'vedic Culture', they justified that in this there is also full discussion of Upanishads

 He told there that he had read these Sanskrit from Khetesh Babu, a friend of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and in front of him, he taught his classes in Sanskrit medium on his orders
 isse aap andaja laga sakate hai ki sanskrit par inkaa kis gaharaai tak adhikaar tha
 Today, perhaps only four-five scholars in the country are left of that height

 He died on 21 May 2011 in Delhi after being unwell for some time at the ripe stage of 88 years
 , On his death, eminent scholar Kalanath Shastri wrote in his tribute article- "" In the last days, Pandey ji left Allahabad and came to Bhopal

 Pandey ji was the Vice Chancellor of Allahabad and Rajasthan University etc
