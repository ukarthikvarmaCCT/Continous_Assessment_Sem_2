 raashtrapati sucarno ne bandung sammelan main 1955 main kaha tha ki raashtra ke andar chote se videshi samudaay dwaara aarthik niyantran, bauddhik niyantran tathaa vaastavik bhautik niyantran ke rup main yah ek nae libaas main upniveshwaad he
 His clear reference was to the increasing role of multinational corporations
 aaj viksit desh apana samrajyavaadee shikanja kasne ke liye inkaa sahaara le rahe hai
 By this, control over the raw materials of poor countries is being done in the form of termites in the name of capital export and easy exchange rates so that those countries become centers of supply of raw materials and sale of finished goods
 is prakaar kaha ja saktaa he ki nav-upniveshwaad samrajyavaadee niyantran kii aisi prakriya he jiskaa prayog viksit raashtra navdith alp viksit rashtron kaa aarthik shoshan karne ke liye karte hai
 These nations are politically independent, but depend on developed countries in the area of economic aid, military aid, arms assistance, technical knowledge, production
 inaki viksit deshon par nirbharta itani adhik bad jaati he ki ye apratyaksh rup se raajnneetik rup se bhi swatantra nahin rah jate
 Argenski has described three forms of colonialism - political colonialism, economically subjugated country and hangover country
 aadhunik yug main raajnneetik drushti se to sabhi desh swatantra ho chuke hai
 Therefore, it is no longer important
 vah antim do ko hi nav-upniveshwaad ke antargat shaamil karata he
 These countries are politically independent but look to developed nations for financial support
 in deshon main aarthik pichhadaapan paaya jaataa he
 Poverty and unstable political systems of the people are indicative of this
 logon kii vyaktigat aay va rashtriya aay naam maatr kii hoti he
 The newly independent nations of Asia and Africa joined this category
 lambe samay tak aarthik vikaas ke liye unhen videshi sahaayta par nirbhar hue
 Most of them still fall under the category of economically subordinate nations
 viksit deshon ne in deshon main adhik se adhik puunji lagaakar inamen apni utpaadan ikaiyaan sthapit kar rakhi hai
 In many countries, this investment is up to 80 percent
 ye desh parashrith rashtron ke raajnneetik jivan ko bhi prabhavit karne kii kshamta rakhte hai
 Such countries are called economic dependent colonies
 america dwaara pakistan, thailand, ghana aadi asia va africa ke deshon main dollar samrajyavad kii niti kaa prasar is prakaar ke upniveshwaad kaa hi ek hissaa he
 It is a nation that is formally independent but politically and economically subject to any foreign power
 ve desh swatantra videsh niti kaa paalan karne main sakasham nahin hote
 After World War II, communist governments controlled by the Soviet Union were established in many countries
 ve sabhi desh pichhalggu desh yaa upgrah upnivesh kii shrenee main aate the
 Today there is a us-backed government in Afghanistan
 isliye afghanistan america kaa pichhalggu desh he
 When needed, military assistance is also provided by many masters to the hanger countries
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad donon mahashaktiyon ne apane pichhalggu deshon kii har prakaar se madad kii thi
 The condition of these colonies is much worse than economically dependent countries
 dwitiya vishwayuddh tak pahunchate-pahunchate samrajyavaadee shaktiyaan itnaa adhik kamjor ho gai ki ve paradheen rashtron par apana samrajyavaadee niyantran banaae rakhane main ayogy siddh hone lage
 At the same time, the independence movement that emerged as a result of the constantly emerging political consciousness in the subjugated countries also caused great harm to the imperialist powers
 do vishwa yudhon ne samrajyavaadee deshon kii arthvyavasthaaon ko baari nuksaan pahunchaaya
 They are no longer in a position to take iron from the agitational forces
 isliye unhone apana samrajyavaadee niyantran dhilaa kar diya or upniveshi shashan kaa ant hone laga
 But after this a new type of imperialism was born which is known as neo-colonialism or economic imperialism
 yah viksit samrajyavaadee deshon dwaara apni khandit arthvyavasthaaon ko patari par laane ke liye kiye gaye prayaason kaa mahatvapurn hissaa tha
 The imperialist powers wanted that by economic control they could gain the same benefits as they had before, by exercising their control over the economic life of the newly independent nations
 iske janm ke nimnlikhit kaaran hai- Gradually, there was a rise of political consciousness in countries who were victims of colonial exploitation
 isse vahaan par swatantrata aandolan kaa teji se vikaas hone laga
 a national liberation movement like India made the colonial forces realize that now their control could not last long
 sanyukt raashtra sangh ke charter main aatmanirnay ke adhikaar ko sweekruti mil chuki thi
 Therefore, due to the fragility of time, they had to free their colonies
 parantu un deshon kii raajnneetik asthirataa ne in deshon ko apana aarthik niyantran sthapit karne kaa mauka de diya
 This transformed old colonialism into a new form
 do vishwa yudhon ne europe kii samrajyavaadee takaton ko bhayankar haani pahunchaai
 Now ruling in the colonies was out of their power
 lagaataar uth rahe mukti andolanon ne bhi bade-bade samrajyon ko nasht kar diya
 Fearing the loss that England had to suffer in India, the British expressed their inability to continue their colonial rule here
 navdith prabhusatta sampann rajyon ne antarrashtriya sambandhon ko prabhavit karnaa shuru kar diya
 China emerged as a communist force in 1949
 ab vahaan par samrajyavaadee takaton kaa tikna mushkil ho gaya
 Mao warned all imperialist forces of dire consequences
 lekin sabhi navdith raashtra china va bharat jaise shaktishaalee nahin the
 Most countries did not have the capability of their economic development
 isliye unhone apane puraane sahukaaron par hi nirbharta kii ichha vyakt kii
 All imperialist forces began to intervene in the countries under their control in the name of financial aid
 isse vahaan nav-upniveshwaad kaa janm hua
 All the newly independent nations felt the need of foreign financial help for their economic development
 lambe samay aupniveshik shashan ke shikaar rah chuke adhiktar deshon ke aarthik sadhano kaa dohan samrajyavaadee desh kar chuke the
 These budding nations had neither sufficient capital nor technical knowledge to finance their economic growth, and forced these countries to borrow from the old colonial powers to achieve their economic development goals
 isse in deshon main puraani upniveshi takatein phir se apana jaal bichaane main kaamyaab hui or nae-upniveshwaad kaa janm hua
 The two world wars caused great economic losses to imperialist forces
 upniveshvaadi shashan ke ant ke saath hi unke kachche maal ke òt tathaa taiyaar maal bechney vaali mandia samaapt ho gai
 This made the imperialist countries feel the need to do what they could in the newly independent nations to search for mandis and obtain raw materials
 aise samay main navdith rashtron kii aarthik majaburiyon kaa laabh uthaane kaa vichaar unke man main aayaa
 So they started to intervene in these countries in the name of economic aid and gradually tried to establish neo-colonial rule there, which brought the notion of neo-colonialism there
 is vyavastha ne samrajyadi takaton kii samast ichchhaaon ko puraa karne main bharpoor sahaayta pahunchaai
 After World War II, Cold War started in the US and Soviet Union
 donon mahashaktiyon ne apni apni sthiti majboot karne ke liye nae rashtron ko apane guton main shaamil karne kaa nirnay kiya
 By means of foreign aid, arms supply, control over multinational corporations, these superpowers took the newly independent nations financially under their control
 isse upgrahi rajyon kii sankhya main vruddhi hone lagi
 All their economic policies were one by one to provide a strong foundation for neo-colonialism
 aaj bhi america jaise viksit raashtra bahurashtriya nigamon ke madhyam se apane nav-upniveshvaadi niyantran ko sudrudh bana rahe hai
 Rich and powerful imperialist nations adopt different ways of controlling themselves in the newly independent nations to fulfill their economic interests
 unka mukhya dhyey aviksit deshon par apana nayaa samrajyavaadee niyantran sthapit karnaa he
 The means adopted by them for this are the following: sabhi dhani deshon dwaara vishwa ke sabhi bhaagon main aarthik tathaa audyogic ikaiyon ko niyantrit karne ke liye bahurashtriya nigamon kaa jaal bichaaya gaya he
 Due to their economic power and scope in their field, they start doing their own arbitrary work in all the countries under their jurisdiction
 inkaa uddeshy adhik se adhik laabh kamanaa hota he
 These multinational companies in developing countries guarantee the supply of raw materials and primary production for capitalist countries by investing direct capital
 ye sarvaadhik nivesh praathmik utpaadan tathaa kaccha maal ke kshetra main karte hai
 They see maximum profit in the investment of basic necessities in life
 vikasshil deshon main saste shram, kachche maal tathaa shoshan kii tivrata ke kaaran puunji nivesh se adhik munafa hota he
 In 1996, 741 foreign companies invested in India
 bharat jaise vikasshil desh main bhi in companiyon ko kai guna laabh praapt hota he
 To protect their capital, these corporations also intervene in the internal affairs of the countries under their control
 ye companiyaan videshon main antarrashtriya puunji vyapaar, vaanijya tathaa utpaadan va vitaran par apana ekadhikaar karne ke liye kaary kar rahe hai
 They have complete control over the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America
 IBM, GEC tathaa Standard Oil jaisi companiyaan in deshon se kaaphi munafa uthaa rahi hai
 They also do not miss political intervention of the nations under their control to bring their profit rate to the maximum level
 is prakaar bahurashtriya nigam nav-upniveshwaad ke sabase adhik shaktishaalee saadhan hai or inhen sabhi viksit rashtron kaa puraa samarthan praapt hota he
 The newly independent nations are completely dependent on foreign aid and imperialist debt for their economic development
 apane karj kii aad main tathaa videshi sahaayta ke naam par viksit raashtra in deshon ko manamaani sharten maanane ke liye baadhya kar dete hai
 They also have to accept many harsh conditions while taking loans
 in deshon kaa karja din-pratidin badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Majority of the income derived from exports goes to repay the interest of imperialist debt and the deficit of balance of payments continues to increase
 unhen is karj kii raashi kaa prayog bahurashtriya companiyon se hi saamaan kharidne ke liye karnaa padataa he
 They also have to accept the conditions for the elimination of trade barriers
 sabhi sharten puunji nivesh karne vaale deshon ke hiton kii poshak hoti hai
 a country receiving foreign aid always has to make fundamental changes in its economy to increase the interests of the investor or the country providing aid
 dhire-dhire samrajyavaadee karj or videshi sahaayta par vikasshil deshon kii nirbharta badhati hi jaati he
 The condition of less developed or backward countries is worse than that of developing countries
 is prakaar kaha ja saktaa he ki videshi sahaayta tathaa samrajyavaadee karj kii hode main viksit desh nav-upniveshwaad kaa hi poshan kar rahe hai
 In today's nuclear age, every nation wants to see itself secure from military and strategic point of view
 iske liye unhen viksit deshon se shastr kharidne padate hai
 Due to being economically weak, these countries also take loans many times
 aaj vikasshil deshon kii rashtriya aay kaa adhiktar hissaa hathiyaar kharidne par hi kharch ho rahaa he
 Shakti demonstration by superpowers promotes weapons competition
 1979 main mahashaktiyon kaa aapasi takaraav videshon main pahunchakar paryaapt laabh dilaae
 The power demonstrations made by these superpowers after the Second World War proved helpful in reducing the decline in their arms industry
 aaj tritiy duniya ke adhiktar desh america, france, britain tathaa soviet sangh se hi hathiyaar kharidte hai
 In order to strengthen their colonial position, imperialist countries have opened their military bases in third world countries
 hathiyaaron kii purti ke rup main ye desh nav-upniveshwaad ko hi badhaava de rahe hai
 Today international institutions like World Bank, International Monetary Fund are operating the international economy
 ye sansthaaen rin dete samay kathor sharten lagaakar nav-upniveshwaad kaa hi poshan karti hai
 Loans to countries are always based on political restrictions
 vah hameshaa viksit rashtron ke hiton kaa hi poshak hota he
 That is why third world countries are strongly demanding for the new international economy
 unka aarope he ki vishwa kii aarthik sansthaaen samrajyavaadee hiton ko poshit karne vaali he
 They continuously attack the economic and political interests of backward or developing countries
 is tarah ye upniveshwaad ke nae rup ko badhaava de rahi hai
 The imperialist powers continue to weaken the backward nations by providing financial assistance
 vahaan ke aarthik va raajnneetik jivan main samrajyavaadee yaa niveshkarta desh kaa puraa hastkshep bad jaataa he
 If the foreign power maintains complete control over the trade of the dependent country, then their control gradually acquires permanent and this dependency continues to grow and eventually takes the form of a satellite state
 ab samrajyavaadee takat aarthik kshetra kii bajaay raajnneetik kshetra kii taraf apana dhyaan laga leti he
 This forces the satellite nation to obey everything about its mentor
 1990 se pehle soviet sangh ne is prakaar kii niti kaa khulkar prayog kiya tha
 Behind this, only the spirit of spread of neo-colonialism exists
 is prakaar kaha ja saktaa he ki aaj bhi nav-upniveshwaad ke rup main viksit raashtra alpaviksit tathaa vikasshil deshon par apana varchasv banaae hue hai
 The poor countries of the south are constantly falling prey to the exploitation of neo-colonialism
 uttar ke viksit desh bahurashtriya nigamon tathaa antarrashtriya aarthik sansthaaon ke madhyam se in deshon par apni pakad majboot banaae hue hai
 Multinational companies are entering termites in developing and backward countries
 adhiktar deshon main ye raajnneetik vyavhaar ko bhi prabhavit karne main samarth he
 Developed nations are also resorting to cultural imperialism to fulfill their interests
 shityudh kii samaapti ke baad sanyukt rajya america vishwa main apane aarthik yaa dollar samrajyavad kaa teji se vikaas kar rahaa he
 Along with economic life, it has also started interfering in the political activities of developing and backward third world countries
 yadi uske ubharate nav-upniveshwaad ko na roka gaya to samast vishwa ke liye nayaa khatra paidaa ho jayega
 Today, Third World countries need to unite and uproot the roots of neo-colonialism to establish a new international economy

 The standard giant-effect hypothesis states a Mars-shaped body, called the thia, has an impact on the Earth, creating a large debris ring around the Earth, which then enters as the Moon

 With the success of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, the establishment of communist rule in Russia, which gave the slogan of the best-ever revolution in the world and talked about the end of capitalism, since the birth of capitalist nations considered it their enemy, thus Soviet Union from the beginning
 Fallen from many enemies, Tanushree's harsh and fierce appearance was seen in Stalin's rule, under which the opponents of communism were suppressed and Nag Rick curbed freedom, the movement of people curbed the freedom of expression of newspapers and writers
 In this way, the system of governance of the Soviet Union as the ruler who enjoyed democracy, covered the spirit of the people and not just communist
 At the time of the establishment of the rule, it was said that the dictatorship of the proletariat would be established, but on a practical level, the dictatorship position on the proletariat
 Husband had the Soviet Union established the dictatorship of the party and those in government lentils and government There was no difference between the party and the system of governance
 It started losing public support
 The rigid system established during the rule of Stalin began to reveal the weaknesses of communist rule
 In fact in Eastern European countries where communist rule was present, the people were dissatisfied with their political economic structure and When opposition to the harshness of communist rule in the Soviet Union started increasing, so did the countries of Eastern Europe
 The mistrust of the communist regime began to increase and mass rebellion occurred
 The economic weakness of the Soviet Union also became the reason for its button
 It is a pathetic thing that the economic direction of the Soviet Union was weakened due to financial assistance to the weak countries and the performance of power in the Cold War
 Soviet funds started to be spent on the means of Cold War in place of developmental renovation of the structure

 Related Census Code: State Code: 09 District Code: 135 Tehsil Code: 00722 antarrashtriya str par saamanyat: sabhi desh ek duusare ke saath maal kaa aayaat niryaat karte hai, sevaaon kaa aadan pradaan karte hai or raashi kaa len dein bhi karte hai
 In this way, after a certain period, if all these items are accounted for, then one country has to take payment from another and the other country has to pay the payment of a third country
 vibhinn deshon ke bich is prakaar ke parasparik len dein ke shesh ko bhugtan shesh kehete hai
 It should be said that the difference between the gross amount repaid by a country to other countries on a given date and the gross amount it receives from other countries is called the 'balance of payments' of that country
 kisi ek desh ko duusare deshon se bhugtan praapt karne kaa adhikaar tathaa avasar tab aata he jab vah desh un deshon ko maal niryaat kare, athwa apane jahaajon, bainkon, insurance companiyon tathaa kushal visheshgyon dwaara apni sevaayen pradaan kare athwa un deshon ke udyog vyapaar main apni poonji lagaakar labhaansh tathaa byaaj praapt karen
 It may also happen that he receives payment of the principal of loans given by that country to other countries or he gets loan form from other countries
 iske atirikt yah bhi sambhav he ki anya deshon ke deshaatak paryatak us desh main aakar maal khariden yaa sevaaon kaa upbhog kare
 In all these circumstances, that country will have the opportunity to receive payment from other countries
 iske vipareet, sambhav he, inhen madon par us desh ko anya deshon kaa kuch bhugtan chukaana bhi ho
 Thus, on one date, the difference between the successful liability of a country on all these items will be known as the remaining balance of that country
 vaise to desh ke bich is prakaar kaa len dein kisi na kisi mad par nirantar chalata rahata he, par yadi kisi nishchit tithi ko ek desh kaa vibhinn madon par len dein kaa antar nikaala jaae to avashya nimna paristhitiyon main se koi ek paristhiti saamne aati he: Thus the balance of payments is called 'favorable', 'counter-productive' and 'balanced' or 'favor', 'opposition' and 'equal'
 par iskaa sambandh kisi desh vishesh ke saath saapeksh arth main vyakt karnaa chahie
 It is not meaningful to say that the balance of payments is favorable, unfavorable and balanced; But it has to be said that the balance of the payment of such country on such date or during such period is favorable, unfavorable or balanced
 bhugtan shesh nikaalane main na keval maal ke aayaat niryaat kaa aadhiky jise 'vyapaar shesh' kehete hai, gyaat kiya jaataa he varan ukt varnit sabhi madon se sakal lendaree or sakal dendaree kaa antar bhi gyaat kiya jaataa he
 The balance of payments is essentially balanced in a continuous sequence of transactions, but the balance of payments of a country to a particular date is found to be favorable or unfavorable
 kisi desh kaa anukool tathaa pratikul bhugtan shesh us desh kii aantarik aarthik sthiti kaa parichaayak mana jaataa he
 If the balance of payments remained favorable, it would mean the abundance of exports by that country, the abundance of production, the strength of industry trade, the earning of foreign exchange, and the increase in the gold reserves of the nation
 iske vipareet pratikul bhugtan shesh kaa arth hoga aayaat kaa bahulya, vyapaar udyog kii shithilataa, utpaadan main giravat, viniyog kaa abhaav, videshi mudra or raashtra ke swarnakosh main kami
 In the present era of planning and development, it has become imperative to import the required quantity of capital goods and skilled experts from developed countries, that the payment should remain favorable in favor of the rest of the country

 rajanyik manyata ek rajnatik kriya he, jiske dwaara ek raashtra manyata detaa he, ek duusare raashtra kii, yaa uski sarkaar kii kisi kriya kii, yaa sthiti kii, jiske dwaara yatharthata yaa satyata pramanit hoti he, evam uski manshaa prakat hoti he, us manyata ke gharelu evam anterrashtriya vaidhanik nishkarsh par
 Recognition can be given, real or legal, by a statement of a government that generally gives recognition
 kisi rajya ko manyata pradaan karne se taatpary us kaary se he jiske dwaara koi rajya yah sweekaar karata he ki usne jis rajya ke raajnneetik astitv ko apni manyata pradaan kii he usamen rajtv ke gun vidyaman hai
 In this, any current member of the international family duly gives his approval to a state or a political party
 iskaa arth yah he ki manyata pradaan karanevaale rajya ke mat se ukt rajya antarrashtriya adhikaron or kartavyon kaa saamaanya adhikari he or usamen antarrashtriya vidhaan ke anusaar praapt honevaale dayitvon ko vahan karne kii samarthyan he
 There are two concepts or principles of state recognition
 Sanghatna-dependent hypothesis and 2
 Declarative or declarative design
 sanghatana-nirbhar pariklp ke anusaar koi bhi rajya keval manyata ke dwaara hi antarrashtriya rajya ban jaataa he
 That is, only by the act of recognition, a state gets statehood and the new government there gets the authority in the international arena
 higel is pariklp kaa sarvapratham vyaakhyaata tha
 Later Holland, Oppenheim and others supported him
 duusare pariklp ke anusaar koi bhi rajya apane adhikaar kii bina par antarrashtriya pad or raashtrapariwaar kii sadsyta praapt kar letaa he
 The act of state recognition is a valid validation of the confirmation of this established truth
 haal, fisher, breyarli tathaa anya log is pariklp ke vyaakhyaata hai
 Out of these two votes, it seems reasonable that statehood is mobilization-dependent as well as declarative
 bhinn bhinn tathyasamoohon ke anusaar kisi par pehla pariklp lagu ho saktaa he, kisi par doosraa
 The existence of any political community, it is only state declaration of this general fact
 rajyatv kii aisi ghoshnaa hone se manyata ke kaaran kuch vaidhanik sthitiyaan utpann ho jaati hai
 Most writers today, such as Lanterpash and Stark, propose this view
 manyata dena yaa na dena rajyon kii ichha par nirbhar karata he
 But this desire should not be arbitrary
 kanoonee siddhanton ke anusaar hi rajyamanyata deni yaa na deni chahie
 Yes, it is of course that political and diplomatic ideology has its influence on the acceptance or rejection of statehood
 manyata do prakaar kii ho sakati he - yaa to spasht hogi yaa sanketit
 Explicit recognition occurs when a communiqué is duly released or announced to reveal the idea of recognition
 jaise, us rajya ko yaa us sarkaar ko is aashay kaa patr likhnaa jisane manyata ke liye prarthana kii ho
 Signed recognition is one where recognition is not explicitly revealed, but by its actions it is revealed that acceptance of recognition is unquestionable; For example, a trade pact between two states or a duly consensual relationship between the two states
 vidhik manyata kaa arth yah he ki manyata denevaale rajya ke anusaar jis rajya ko athwa jis sarkaar ko manyata pradaan kii ja rahi he vah antarrashtriya samudaay main sakriy bhaag lene ke liye antarrashtriya vidhaan main pratipaadit aavashyaktaaon kii vidhiwat purti karata he
 Actual recognition means that according to the opinion of the state of recognition, the state or government to which the recognition has been granted, temporarily fulfills those requirements for a short period, although all the requirements are not present and the said The state has not yet attained sufficient fortitude
 vaastavik manyata alpakaaleen hoti he or vah us samay lautaa lee ja sakati he, jab ve aavashyaktaayen, jinka manyata ke liye puraa hona anivaary he, bad main bhi puri nahin ho paatin
 Legal recognition is final and permanent and cannot be returned once given
 kai maamalon main yah baat sweekaar kar lee gai he ki jahaan tak iske kanoonee parinaamon kaa sambandh he, vahaan tak vaastavik manyata or vidhik manyata main koi antar nahin he
 When there is a change in the general and statutory system in the post of president of a state with international distinction, it is informed to other states
 ve rajya ukt rajya ke nae adhyaksh ko apni ore se badhai kaa sandesh bhejkar use apni manyata pradaan karte hai
 There is difficulty in this only when there is a change in the office of the president or in the government through revolution
 aise maamalon main do prakaar ke pareekshan kaam main laae jate hai : pehla pareekshan to yah he ki kya nai sarkaar vaastavik sarkaar he vaastavik sarkaar he, jiskaa rajya par prabhavakaari niyantran he or kya vah ukt pradesh ke paryaapt kshetra par apana prabhutv sthapit kiye hue he tathaa uskaa koi prabhavakaari virdohi paksh nahin he
 This is called external test
 doosraa pareekshan yah hota he ki kya nai sarkaar un dayitvon ko puraa karne main samarth he jo antarrashtriya vidhaan dwaara tathaa rashtrasang ke adhikaarptr dwaara nirdhaarit hai? ise aantarik yaa vishaygat pareekshan kehete hai
 States that are asked to give recognition to a new state or government, they postpone their decision only in cases where the government is not permanent or where revolutions often occur due to which the government keeps changing
 parantu kisi sarkaar ko manyata dene athwa na dene se swayan rajya kii manyata kaa koi sambandh nahin he
 The state remains recognized as an international entity
 kai deshon main prachlit paripati ke anusaar rajyon ko di gai manyata purvakalik prabhaav rakhti he or nyaayalay nae rajya yaa nai sarkaar ke un sabhi kaaryon kaa vaid sweekaar rakate hai jo navamaanya sarkaar dwaara uske haath main satta aane ke prarambh se kiye jate hai
 Consequences of recognition - The following are the main results of recognition of a new state or new government: manyata praapt karne ke uparaant - ukt rajya ko athwa sarkaar ko yah kshamta mil jaati he ki vah manyata pradaan karanevaale rajyon ke saath koi sandhi kar sake athwa kootnithik sambandh sthapit kar le
 The said state is empowered to file suit in the courts of the accrediting states
 manyataprapt rajya ko manyata pradaan karanevaale rajyon ke nyaayalayon ke adhikarashetra se apane sambandh main tathaa apni sampatti ke sambandh main unmukti yaa chhot praapt ho jaati he
 The recognized state also gets the right to demand and acquire any property of its predecessor government within the territory of a recognized state
 yadi kisi desh main grihayuddh chhid jaae to kud sharten puri hone par vidrohiyon ko yuddhrat ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he, jaise- Civil war with widespread hostility
 rajdrohiyon dwaara rashtriya seemaakshatra ke paryaapt kshetra par aadhipaty sthapit kar lenaa or usapar vyavasthit shashan prabandh chalaanaa
 To abide by the rules of war by the treason under any responsible power
 anya-tisare-rajyon ke liye grihayuddh ke sambandh main arthath apane rukh kii vyakhya karne kii vyaavhaarik aavashyaktaa kaa utpann ho janaa
 If there is a situation that only a few of these conditions are fulfilled, then other states can confer rebellion as a traitor and consider them to be de facto officers of the area where their authority is established, not law-breakers
 Ho
 yon samaanyat: koi rajya yadi kisi rajya ko manyata de detaa he to vah kisi raajnneetik uddeshy se uski manyata waapas nahin le saktaa
 But in certain circumstances, recognition can be withdrawn
 udaahranarth, yadi koi rajya apni swatantraaa kho baithta he, athwa uski sarkaar prabhaavashunya ho jaati he, athwa grihayuddh main koi yudhyamaan paksh parajeet ho jaataa he to aisi sthiti main rajya kii manyata waapas lee ja sakati he

 He described her as "highly psychotic, lacking the human response to other people's suffering"
 saath hi use apni kushi ke kaaran dusron, visheshkar magaluon, ke katl karne vaala dikhaaya he
 There was a lack of consciousness in him, he did not regret his actions but he did not even understand the importance of his extra humanity
 use na to manushya ke saath saahchary yaa mitrataa sthapit karnaa pasand nahin tha or na hi use kisi se pyaar yaa lagaav tha
 He considered himself superior and considered everyone inferior in front of him
 rolling ne yah bhi likhaa he ki vah " vastav main avishwasaneey dhang se takat kaa bhookha, naslvaadi" tha
 If he looked in the mirror mirror, he would see himself as "omnipotent and indestructible" as he wanted

 His mother dies due to the effects of decoction and the father leaving his mother, but if his mother had lived and loved him, everything would have changed
 vah aakarshan jiske kaaran tom riddle ke rup main janme balak kaa voldemort main parivartan hua vah bahut aavashyak he kyonki yahi vah sankalpana dikhaata he jiske kaaran is paatr kaa janm hua
 Like almost all the villains, Voldemort's eagerness causes his downfall
 vah mrityu se atyadhik bhay tha, jise usne sharmnaak tathaa ghrunit insaani kamajori bataayi he
 He had many signs of being egoistic
 apane praan bhakshiyon ke saamne voldemort ne yah mana he ki usne harry ke mata-pita par hamale kii badi keemat chukaai he, or phir usne yah avlokan kiya ki isamen kya galat hua or ant main vah ye dosha swayan par letaa he

 jab voldemort navjaat harry kii hatya kaa prayaas karata he tab uski aatma ke hisse ke saath sarpbhasha main bolne kii kala harry main bhi chali jaati he

 Dumbledore has also stated that Voldemort's magical knowledge is far greater than any living sorcerer, and that even with Voldemort's return to full power, Dumbledore's knowledge of having the most powerful defense spells in front of his spells would be insufficient
 dambldor ne yah bhi kaha he ki voldemort sambhavtah hoguarts kaa sabase budhimaan vidhyaarthee he
 But despite Voldemort's unique talent and skill, he was unfit to withstand such powerful magic as love; No powers worked at this time
 puure shrunkhlaa main uski yah sabase badi jaadui ayogyata dikhaai gayi he
 Voldemort initially begins to doubt his magical powers, but after regaining his body and strength he confesses to his life-worshipers that he had ignored the power of Lily Potter's love that saved Harry's life

 Rolling establishes in the book that Voldemort was magically associated with him through a scar made on Harry's forehead
 jab usne harry ko mrityu shraap diya or uskaa ulta asar usee par ho gaya, tab yah nishaan harry ke maathe par ban gaya tha
 In the book and films it is shown that Harry's mark was indicative of Voldemort's presence
 yah tab adhik dard karata tha jab anishtdev uske nikat hota tha yaa vah nirdayee yaa bahut khush hone vaala bhav darshata tha
 According to Rolling, at the time of the attack on the newborn Harry, Voldemort gave Harry a magical window of his mind as a forehead mark that no other magician does

 These pre-emptive attacks, also called Operation Genghis Khan, were inspired by Operation Focus's victory in Israel's arab-israeli six-day War, but a large number of Israeli fighters on Arab Air Force bases in that 1967 war
 Airplanes were dispatched, while Pakistan sent less than 50 aircraft

 There are many ideologies about the nature of Parabrahma in India
 jisamen dwait, advait yaa keoladvait, vishishtadvait, shuddhadvait, dwaitadvait jaisi kai saidhantik vichaardhaaraein hai
 The Acharya described the form in which Brahma came to know
 itani vichaardhaaraein hone par bhi sabhi yah maanate he ki bhagwaan hi is sristi kaa niyantaa he
 The founder of the Advaita ideology is Shankaracharya, also known as Shankaradvaita or Kevaladvaita
 shankaracharya maanate hain ki sansar main brahm hi satya he
 Everything else is false
 jeev keval agyaan ke kaaran hi brahm ko nahin jaan paata jabaki brahm to uske hi andar virajman he
 He has stated Advaita principle in his Brahmasutra by saying "ego Brahmasmi"
 vallabhacharya apane shuddhadvait darshan main brahm, jeev or jagat, teenon ko satya maanate hai, jise vedon, upanishdon, brahmasutra, gita tathaa shrimadbhagwat dwaara unhone siddh kiya he
 The Advaita principle also permeates the pasture world
 jab pair main kaanta chubhta he tab aakhon se pani aata he or haath kaanta nikaalaneke liye jaataa he
 This is a perfect example of Advaita
 shankaracharya kaa ‘ecobrahm, dwitiyao naasti’ mat tha
 Parambrahm existed before creation
 brahm sat or sristi jagat asat he
 By Shankaracharya's opinion, Brahman is nirguna, passive, sata-asat, separate from work-cause
 brahm ankhon se nahin dekha ja saktaa, man se nahin janaa ja saktaa, vah gyaata nahin he or na gyey hi he, gyaan or kriya ke bhi ateet he
 Due to Maya, the living being is not able to know 'ego Brahma'

 Self Portrait, 1985 Anil Karanjay was a full-fledged Indian artist
 purv bengal main janm lenevaale karanjay ne banaras main shiksha praapt kii, jahaan unka parivaar 1947 main bhartiya upmahadweep ke bantwaare ke baad bas gaya
 As a young child he spent a lot of time playing with clay, making toys and arrows
 unhone bahut jaldi hi jaanwaron or paudhon kaa chitra bananaa yaa jis bhi vastu ne unhen prerit kiya uskaa chitra bananaa bhi shuru kar diya
 In 1956, he left school to become a full-time student of the Indian Art Center headed by a Bengal school guru and a Nepali-origin Karanman Singh
 This teacher encouraged Anil to experiment widely and study the art of every culture
 anil 1960 tak yahaan rahe, is dauraan ve niyamit rup se pradarshan or anya chaatro kaa adhyaapan karte rahe
 isi avadhi ke dauraan unhone bharat kala bhawan main banaras ke maharaj ke antim darbari chitrakaar kii dekharekh main laghu chitrakala kaa abhyaas kiya
 He also enrolled at Benaras Polytechnic to learn clay modeling and metal casting
 1960 ke krantikari ke dauraan, anil bhartiya or antarrashtriya raajnneetik-saanskrithik andolan main sabase aage the
 In 1962, he founded joint artists with Karunanidhan Mukhopadhyay
 His studio name 'devil's Workshop' attracted artists, writers, poets and musicians from all over India and abroad

 Anil and others of the group lived in a community during this period and exchanged discussions and experiences with 'inventors' from many countries
 anil karanjay kaviyon ke ek prasiddh kattarpanthi bengali samooh bhukhi peedi ke ek bahut sakriy sadsy rahe, jise bhukhwaadi হাংরি আন্দোলন andolan ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Anil was associated with the Beat Generation when Alan Ginsberg and Peter Orlevsky interacted with the Hungryalists during their stay in India
 bhukhwaadi patna, kolkata or banaras main aadhaarit the or unhone nepal main avant garde ke mahatvapurn samparkon ke saath bhi jaalsaji kii
 anil ne bhukhwaadi prakashnon ke liye anek chitra banaae
 unhone poster or kavitaaon kaa bhi yogadan diya
 or ve bharat main laghu patrika andolan ke ek sansthaapak the
 In 1969, he moved to New Delhi where he organized and participated in a 'mini magazine exhibition' at the Delhi Shilpi Chakra
 70 ke dashak ke purvarddh main anil karanjay ne apni takneekee paripakvata or apane swapn sareekhe, aksar bhayanak, gusse bhari kalpana ke saath bhartiya kala halkon main ek baari prabhaav choda
 apane adhikansh praarambhik chitron main, unhone ajeeb paridrishyon -dhamkee or aarope; prakritik roopon - chattaanon, badal, jaanwaron or ped se ubharne vaali vikrut maanav roopon kaa srijan kiya - jo jan chetana ke liye ek vaahan ban gaye, jo sadiyon ke daman ke khilaaf apni urja ko mukt kar rahi he
 After his move to Delhi, his deformed human forms were often integrated with ruins, like a metaphor for the tyranny of history
 lekin vyangyatmak hasya kaa ek tatv, inamen se adhikansh canvaason main anupasthit nahin he
 Furthermore, Anil's imagination sometimes approaches a poetic romanticism, an almost gentle expression
 yah unke baad ke adhikansh kaamon main or adhik spasht hua jinamein paridrishy pramukh mul bhav kaa kaam karata he or maanav upasthiti kaa keval sanket hota he, aksar ek rahasyamay gantavy ke liye jate raste yaa sidhiyon dwaara
 His landscape also echoes ghostly whispers through old walls, gates or sculpted pillars
 1972 main unhone ek rashtriya puraskaar jeeta, lekin iskaa unke jivan par bahut maamuli prabhaav padaa
 ve vishisht rup se sthapana-virdohi kalakaar the or vah apane baaki jivan main bhi aise hi rahenge
 teevr samuhik bhaavana or 1960 ke dashak kii uplabdhiyon ne anil par gaharaa prabhaav daalaa tha
 Since then they have often felt creatively isolated
 As a political cultural activist, he will always be committed and will maintain a relationship with the hungry generation of Malay Roy Choudhary, Subimal Basak, Sameer Roychowdhury, Tridiv Mitra and other writers of that era
 But as an artist, he found himself at a distance from his contemporaries
 Over time, his idea became more inclined to the mode of expression that is considered out of fashion by art establishments and newly affluent art collectors who grew out of India as a global economy
 yah vishesh rup se unke antim dashak kaa sach bana jab shuddh paridrishy unke sanchaar ke siddhant kaa vaahan ban gaya
 However, people have never been very far from their lonely landscapes
 vastav main, unke ped or anya prakritik tatv ajeeb maanav ishaaron dwaara alankrita hai
 Sometimes the entire nature seems to conspire against a hidden enemy, reflecting Anil's deep concern as an environmental activist
 lekin yah keval unke vishay nahin he jinhone unke liye kalakaaron kii sansaarik safalataa yaa vifaltaa kaa faisla karanevaale shaktishaalee samoohon main upeksha or apmaan arjeet kiya
 Realism also played its part which was characteristic of his later works
 sataha par ye lagbhag shastreey dikhaai dete hai, phir bhi unki saraahna karanevaalon ke liye abhi tak, ve ek ucch yatharthwaad kii abhivyakti kar rahe hai jo hamaare puure samakaleen kaal main pratidhwanit he
 Anil himself has compared his work to a 'magical realism'
 jaisaa ki unhone apane par bani ek film main, da nechar of art, main kaha he: "mere chitra ek sapana hai, prakruti kaa ek sapana
" chitron kii bhaavnaatmak saamagree sarvocch mahatv kii thi
 In this, Anil draws from his vast knowledge of Indian classical music, particularly about raga, in which a composition expresses the mood or feeling of a time or a season
 kala main, iske samatuly ko ras kaha jaataa he, vastutah ras yaa saar, ek saundarya drushtikon he jise anil ne kalathit or saarvbhaumik samajha or apane chitron main uski vyakhya kii maang kii
 In his mature phase, Anil's philosophy about art underwent a major change
 jahaan uske aarambhik kaaryon ko vaicharik rup main takaraav ke taur par varnit kiya ja saktaa he, unke baad ke kaam kii kalpana or nishpaadan darshak ko raahat dene ke liye kii gayi
 He saw himself as a skilled professional, akin to a doctor
 jaisaa ki unhone kai avasaron par kaha jisamen vah film bhi shaamil he: "aaj ke kalakaar kii bhoomika hamaare samaaj dwaara die gaye ghaavon ko bharne kii he
 " apane puure karier ke dauraan, anil ne vibhinn madhyamon, vishesh rup se taileey rangon se kaam kiya tha jise vah atyadhik utkrisht maanate the
 But in the final years he completed many of his best paintings with pastel crayons on top of all the dried pastels
 yah ek aisa madhyam he jisamen unhone shaayad apane samay ke kisi bhi anya bhartiya kalakaar se adhik maharath or anusandhanatmakataa dikhaai he
 In his final decades, Anil also became a successful painter
 unhone astitv ke ek saadhan ke rup main anek chitra banaae, lekin is style main unka sabase acha kaam zyaadaatar un logon par he jo unke kareeb hai
 Following the tradition of masters of the past, he made several self-portraits
 Some of these include his most profoundly expressive works
