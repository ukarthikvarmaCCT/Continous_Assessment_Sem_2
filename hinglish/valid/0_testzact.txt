 Between 21 and 60 carbon atoms have been found in hydrocarbons
 pradhanthya narmal or vivvruth shrinkhalaawaale hydrocarbon rahete hai, par sanvruth shrinkhalaawaale hydrocarbon bilkul apvarjit nahin hai
 Petroleum contains up to three percent wax
 ise paraphin mom kehete hai
 Most of the wax gets into "lubricating oil" when petroleum is distilled
 nirvaat main, athwa bhaap kii upasthiti main, aswan se jo asut praapt hota he usamen mom kii maatra 40 se 50 pratishat tak rah sakati he
 Therefore, such distillate is called wax distillate
 dakshin-purv asia ke tel ke asut main 40 pratishat tak mom paaya gaya he, jabaki europe or america ke kachche tel ke asut main 10 pratishat se adhik mom nahin rahata
 There are two main methods of extracting wax from distillate
 ek reeti main mom asut ko paryaapt thandha karte hai, jisase thos mom drav tel se alag ho jaataa he
 Now filter it in the filter press
 filter press kai prakaar ke tathaa kai patton ke hote hai or vibhinn daab par kaary karte hai
 If the amount of wax in the distillate is small then most of the wax is removed at once, otherwise the process has to be repeated several times
 isse kai shrenee ke mom praapt ho sakate hai
 There is some oil left in such wax cake
 tel kii maatra mom main 0
3 pratishat se adhik nahin rahani chahie
 There are special instruments for extracting oil from raw wax, which are called 'swedek'
 swedak kai prakaar ke bane hai, par un sabhi ke siddhant praaia: ek hi he
 Let the wax melt and frost
 paatr ke pede main tel ikattha hota he or nikaal liya jaataa he

 Then any coolant fluid flows in the tap coil
 isse mom kii thos tikia banati he
 Now the heaters heat the room slowly
 isse tikiye kaa tel chootaa, yaa swedan karata, he
 The oil that comes out in this way is called "foot oil"
 paad tel main kuch mom rahata he
 Wax of foot oil can also be extracted by repeating the process
 tel ke nikal jane par mom ko fuller mitti, yaa jautav koyale, par dhire dhire chaanakar, athwa salphurik amla dwaara upachaarit kar safed or saaf mom praapt karte hai

 In other words, the effect of vacuum casing, radio frequency coaters and other objects on the particle is expressed by impedance

 The following property can be derived from the above expression- z ∗ | | = z | | { \ displaystyle Z^{*||}=Z^{||}} The impedance is defined at each point of the particle path
 ham jaanate hai ki kan-punj ek nirvaat-chambar ke bheetar-bheetar chalati he
 Wherever the shape of the beam-pipe changes, the particle-beam impedance is encountered there
 iske alaava radio aavriti kotor pratibaadha kaa doosraa mukhya kaaran he
 There are several models that can be used to represent the geometrical design KO of beam-pipe even if detailed geometric modeling is not done
 For the longitudinal case, one has z | | = r s 1 - i q 1 + q 2 2 { \ displaystyle Z_ {||} = R_ {s} { \ frac {1-iq} {1 + q ^ {2} \ left ^ {2 xxrep 5 } with r s { \ displaystyle R_{s}} the shunt impedance, q { \ displaystyle Q}, the quality factor, and ω r { \ displaystyle \ omega _{r}} the resonant frequency
 Given a circular beam piper of radius b { \ displaystyle b}, and conductivity σ { \ displaystyle \ sigma}, the impedance is given by z = 1 − i c b ω 2 π σ { \ displaystyle Z={ \ frac {1-i}{cb}}{ \ sqrt { \ frac { \ omega }{2 \ pi \ sigma xxrep 4 } The similarly longitudinal wakefield is almost given by w = q 2 π b c σ 1 s 3 / 2 { \ displaystyle W={ \ frac {q}{2 \ pi b}}{ \ sqrt { \ frac {c}{ \ sigma }}}{ \ frac {1}{s^{3 / 2 xxrep 4 } The transverse wake-function from the resistive wall is given by w ≈ 1 s 1 / 2 { \ displaystyle w \ approx { \ frac {1}{s^{1 / 2 xxrep 4 } The impedance acts back on the beam and can cause a variety of effects, often considered deleterious for accelerator functioning
 In general, impedance effects are classified under the category of "collective effects" due to the fact that the whole beam must be considered together, and not just a single particle
 The whole beam may, however, cause particular changes in the dynamics of individual particles such as tune shifts and coupling
 Whole beam changes include emittance growth and instabilities that can lead to beam loss

 If a star is a Mahadanava, it gets a Roman numeral of I
 III kaa matlab he ke tara ek daanav tara he or v kaa matlab he ke yah ek bouna tara he 
 Our sun range is G2V or else it is a yellow dwarf star which is 2 steps towards the orange star

 The Harvard method is a method of dividing dwarf stars into categories
 dekha gaya he ke tara jitna nile kii taraf hota jaataa he utana hi garam hota he or utana hi bada hota he
 Shown below is the temperature of stars in different categories and the size and luminosity of our sun
 dhyaan rahe ke yah sirf mukhya anukram ke taron ke liye jaays he - In the period after 1880 AD, scientists working at the observatory of Harvard University made the categories of stars from 'A' to 'O'
 lekin 1920 ke dashak main bhartiya khagolvaigyanik meghnad saaha ne taron ke varnakram or unke satahi taapmaana main sambandh dikhaaya
 As the knowledge in this field grew, scientists changed the categories according to temperature and where the two categories were actually about stars of the same temperature, they were merged to remove one category
 saaha ke or anya vaigyanikon ke adhyayan se yah baat saafe ho gai ke OBAFGKM darasal satahi taapmaana kii shreniyan hai
 In 1943, three scientists working at the Yorkies Observatory created a new grading method for the spectrum of stars
 in vaigyanikon ke naam wiliam wilson morgan, philip si keenan or chhadisso kalman the isliye is pranali ko "MKK" vidhi bhi kaha jaataa he jo inke antim naamon ke pehle angrezi aksharon ko jodakar bana he
 Where Harvard grading runs only according to surface temperature and is used only for dwarf stars, both surface temperature and luminosity are used in the Yerkys grading and all the stars are graded
 daanav taare dravyaman main to boune taron jitna hi hote hai lekin unka vyas boune taron se zyaada hota he
 Therefore, gravity, gas density and pressure on the surface of the demon stars are much lower than the three dwarf stars
 is antar kaa varnakram par kaafii asar dekha ja saktaa he
 Due to the high pressure of the dwarf stars, the spectrum of their spectrum is "spread"

 rachanaatmakatavaad antarrashtriya sambandhon ke adhyayan kaa teesraa drushtikon he
 Compared to idealism and realism, this approach recommends examining world politics on the social plane
 rachanaatmakataavaadiyon kaa daawa he ki antarrashtriya sambandhon kii sahi samaj keval bhautik simaaon ke daayre main hone vaali tarksangat anyonyakriyaaon se hi nahin hasil kii ja sakati or na hi unhen sansthagat simaaon ke bheetar parakhane se kaam chal saktaa he 
 According to constructivists, relations between sovereign states are not based only on their stable national interests
 unhen lambi avadhi ke dauraan bani asmitaaon ke prabhaav main uthaaye jane vaale kadamon ko praroopon ke taur par dekh kar samajhnaa padataa he
 Creativists attach importance to international law, diplomacy and sovereignty, focusing their attention on institutions at the level of the international community
 shashan-vyavasthaayen bhi unke liye mahatvapurn hai, kyonki ve bhi viniyamkaari or vidheyak sanrachanaayen paidaa karti hai
 a social world is created in their hands with the help of which the behavior and conduct of the state can be interpreted
 rachanaatmakatavaad kaa siddhant bhautik ayaamon kii upeksha nahin karata, par vah unke saath-saath antarrashtriya vyavastha ko samajhane ke liye saamaajik ayaamon ko bhi jod detaa he
 Under this, when institutions are discussed, it does not mean only organizational structure
 sanstha kaa taatpary he asmitaaon or hiton kii ek sthir sanrachana
 a structure that involves shared understanding, shared expectations and social knowledge
 rachanaatmakataavaadi sansthaaon ko multah ek sangyanatmak astitv kii tarah dekhte hai jinhen apane karttaaon ke vichaaron kii simaaon ke daayre main hi rahanaa padataa he
 Along with the normative influence of institutional structures, constructivism examines the changing standards and formulas between identities and interests
 chunki rajya or anya karttaaon kii gatividhiyon ke kaaran sansthaaon main lagaataar parivartan hota rahata he, isliye rachanaatmakatavaad sansthaaon or karttaaon ko paraspar anukulan karte rahane vaale astitvon kii tarah dekhtaa he
 From this description it may seem that it would be difficult to implement constructivism as a theoretical approach
 darasal, rajyon ke vyavhaar kaa andaaza lagane ke liye kisi ek khaas saamaajik sanrachana ko chunane kii sifaarish karne ke bajaay yah drushtikon kahata he ki kisi ek paristhiti main maujuud sanrachana kii jaanch-padtaal karke uske vishisht daayre main rajya ke vyavhaar kaa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 If the assumption turns out to be false, it means that the structure is not properly understood or it has suddenly changed
 masalan, agar yathartwaadee kehete hai ki antarrashtriya sambandhon main araajaktaa vyaapt he, to rachanaatmakataavaadi kahenge ki unki yah dharna hobbs dwaara pratipaadit ‘prakrut avasthaa’ ke aaine main antarrashtriya samudaay ko dekhne se upji he
 This natural state is derived from a specific structure of social relations that has now changed
 sanrachnawadiyon kii manyata ke anusaar antarrashtriya sansthaayen viniman bhi karti hai or vidheyak bhoomika bhi nibhaati hai
 Regulatory role means validating or restricting certain types of behaviors and practices
 vidheyak bhoomika kaa matlab he kisi vyavhaar yaa aacharan ko paribhaashit karte hue use ek nishchit taatpary se sampann karnaa
 The state is a natural identity in his eyes
 vah apane buniyadi lakshyon kaa nirdhaaran karata he
 But achieving these goals depends on social identities; That is, the way the state considers itself in the context of international society, similarly its social identities will be formed
 isi tarah kii asmitaaon ke aadhaar par rajya kaa rashtriya hit sanrachit hoga
 Structuralists do not completely ignore the importance given to anarchy by anarchists, but they say that anarchy cannot be important in itself
 sambandhon kii araajaktaa do mitra rajyon ko bich bhi ho sakati he or do shatru rajyon ke bich bhi
 The meaning of both will be different
 is lihaaz se araajaktaa nahin, balki uske prabhaav main ban sakane vaale saamaajik sambandhon kii kismein hi mahatvapurn ho sakati hai
 According to these different kinds of social relations, states define their interests
 masalan, sheet-yuddh ke dauraan america or soviet sangh ke bich kaa rishta bhi ek saamaajik sambandh tha jiske tahat ve donon ek-duusare ko shatru kii tarah dekhte the or usee ke mutabik unke rashtriya hiton kii sanrachana hoti thi
 When they stopped looking at each other in the mirror of that social relationship, or the circumstances of that kind of social relationship were no longer there, the Cold War ended as a result
 spasht he ki rachanaatmakatavaad ek vyaakhyaatmak siddhant ke taur par apni upyogita bahut spasht nahin kar paaya he
 Despite this, he has succeeded in presenting a theoretical framework
 rachanaatmakatavaad ke prachlit hone ke peeche yathartwaadee or adarshavaadi drushtikonon kii aparyaapttaon kii bhoomika bhi he

 di essence of buddhism iskaa hindi matlab buddha dharm kaa saar he
 It is a treatise which is the final form of essays which were written on Buddhist subjects for some magazines of South India
 iskaa uddeshy he ki ek hi sthal par buddha-dharm ke sambandh main jo mukhya manyataayen hai, unka sangrah uplabdh ho jaae, aisa sangrah jisamen un mukhya manyataon kaa moolyankan aadhunik gyaan kii drushti se kiya gaya ho
 Originality is not claimed here
 isamen uplabdh adhikansh saamagree bhalee prakaar gyaat puratatvavidon ke granthon main prapya he
 Despite containing quotations from Pali and Sanskrit texts, it is not claimed that this work is a byproduct of Pali and Sanskrit schism
 apane swami kii seva main lage hue ek shishy kii vinamr aadaranjali ke atirikt yah or kuch nahin
 While presenting his master's teachings to the public, it is imperative for the disciple not to let the beliefs which are the foundation of those teachings be lost
 jahaan tak bhagwaan buddha kii baat he satya hi unki adhikaar vaani he or shishy ko satya kaa hi anukaran karnaa chahie
 Therefore, all the branches of Buddhism, all of them justify the theory that to be rational or truthful is necessary for the teaching of Lord Buddha
 aadhunik gyaan kii prishthbhumi main buddha dharm kaa pratipaadan karte hue granth ke rachayita ne apni buddha sthiti ke saath kabhi bhi samjhauta nahin kiya he balki keval us adarsh kaa anukaran kiya he jo baudhon main aarambhik kaal se pratishthit tha
 If he has succeeded in bringing Buddhism to some extent as a form of modernism, he has not done so by silencing the modern ideas with Buddhism, but by going deeper into all the beliefs of Buddhism, he is hiding the truth
 He has done this only by exposing

 kuch puranic rashtravaadi manyataon ko chhod diya jaae to isame kuch andeh nahin kii buddha dharm paashchaatya ke logon ko bhi aakarshith karegaa
 It is also true that it is said that Buddhism is so pure that it cannot attract people who do not consider marriage to be a hindrance to a life of high thought
 is drushti se buddha dharm kaa moolyankan karne par bhi buddha dharm ke liye koi chintaa kii baat nahin he
 From the earliest times, there have been such cults of Buddhism that established that the planetary can also benefit from the qualification, a religion which is so flexible that it can incorporate the Vajracharyas of Nepal on one side and on the other hand There is so much space in Sri Lankan settlers that it can contain both ascetic life on one side and the life-style of life on the other

 With the expansion of education and independent thought, it is not possible that Buddhism can attract the contemplative Indians who are now having nothing to do with Ram nor Rahim, neither Krishna nor Christ, nor Kali or Lakshmi

 Dandi is a famous Sanskrit litterateur
 inke jivan ke sambandh main pramanik soochnaaon kaa abhaav he
 Some scholars consider them to be late seventh or early eighth century, while some scholars consider them to be born between 550 and 650 AD
 dandi kab hue or inaki rachanaayen koun koun si hai, yah prashn ab bhi vivaadaaspad he
 His biography is also not particularly known
 dakshin bharat main uplabdh 'avantisundari katha' or 'avantisundari kathasaar' -- in donon ke aadhaar par unke jivan ke vishay main itnaa hi gyaat ho sakaa he ki dandi ke prapitamah damodar pandit the
 He was probably a friend of Bharvi
 unheen kii sahaayta se chalukyavanshi raja vishnuvardhan ke nikat pahunch sake
 Dandi was born in Bharvi's fourth generation
 kanchinaresh ke aashray main inkaa jivan vyateet hua
 Seeing the considerable influence of Dandi's 'kavyadarsha' on the Kankaraj 'kavraj Marg' of the Kannada language and finding the Sinhalese ornamentation 'siy-bus-lakar' built on Kavadarsha basis, it is certain that Dandi existed before the ninth century
 is prakaar 'lakshm lakshmin tanotiti' is uddhran ke kalidas ke ek prasiddh padyansh par ashrith hone se dandi kaa kaal asandigdh rup se kalidas ke pashchaat thahartaa he
 With the view of Prof
 Pathak, the subject should be designed after 650 A
D
, because the subject for the study is on the basis of recruitment
 kavyadarshokt rajverma ko narsinghverma dwitiya kaa virud yaa upnaam maananevaalon ke anusar dandi kaa samay saatvin shatee kaa uttarardh or aathvin kaa aarambh mana ja saktaa he
 If the effect of Kadambari's Shukanashopadesh on one verse of 'kavyadarsha' is accepted, then its period - Banabhatta is also different
 avantisundari kathasaar ko dandi kii kriti maananevaalon ke mat se bhi uparyukt kathan kii pushti hoti he
 But some scholars consider Dandi to be earlier than Subandhu and some people are also predecessors of Banabhatta
 dwitiya mat waalon ke anusaar subandhu, dandi or baan -- teenon hi 550 itho or 650 itho ke bich utpanan hue the
 There is an objection in the opinion of these people to consider 'avantisundari Katha' or 'kathasar' as punitive
 kinvadanti or subhashit ke anusaar dandi kii teen rachanaayen vishrut bataai gai hai
 The first composition is 'kavyadarsha' and the second is 'dasakumarcharit'
 adhiktar vidwaanon ne yah maan liya he, parantu kuch anya vidvan -- in donon ko ek sahityakar kii na maanakar dandi naam ke do bhinn vyaktiyon kii rachana hone kaa anumaan karte hai
 One of the main reasons for this is that the valid principles of poetry which are rendered and instructed in 'poetry', its inconsistency and opposition are seen in 'dasakumarcharit'
 at: acharya or kavyakaar ke siddhant or vyavhaar kii asangati ek nahin do bhinn kritikaron kaa sanket karti he
 But according to most scholars, the reason for the above inconsistency has been assumed that in the beginning of his literary life, Mahakavi composed 'dasakumarcharit'
 'kavyadarsh' us praudhavastha kii rachana he jab dandi kaa shastreey vaidushya paripakv ho gaya tha
 Therefore, most scholars have no opposition in considering these two works as punishable
 parantu teesri kriti kaa nirdhaaran ab tak vivaadaaspad he
 'mritchkatik', which is called Shudrakarchit by the opinion of 'pirol', is the third composition of Dandi
 iskaa ek aadhaar 'kavyadarsh' main bina kisi naam ke 'mrichctic' kii ek pankti kaa uddhran he
 The second reason is the extreme coherence in the characterization of the society and their characters depicted in both 'mrchchakatik' and 'daskumarcharit'
 pratham kaaran koi mahatvapurn kaaran nahin he
 The second only informs that both works are often trying to portray real-time and vibrant depictions of contemporary society
 'mallikamarut' bhi kabhi kabhi dandikrut kaha jaataa he
 But it is a work of 15th century 'udand Ranganath'
 'avantisundarikatha' ko ab anek vidvan 'dashakumarcharit' kii kathaon ke samya par dandi kii tritiy rachana maanane lage hai
 Seeing the stylistic differences between the two prose, some pundits have objected to it being punished
 par anya vidvan yuvavastha kii style main 'dashakumarcharit' ko virachit or praudhavastha kii paripakv style main 'avantisundarikatha' kaa nirmaan maanakar ise bhi asandigdh rup main dandi kii tritiy rachana sweekaar karte hai
 Some people have started to consider 'avantisundarikatha' as a lost former chair of 'daskumar Charitha'
 'dashakumarcharit' sanskrit ke teen prasiddh gadhykavyon main ek mahatvapurn or prasiddh kriti he
 He is written in the style of poetry
 'mahabhashya' or pracheen upanishdon kii sahaj gadhyshailee, 'hitopadesh' aadi kii nitisahityavali subodh or vyaavhaarik gadhyshailee kii tulana main dashakumarcharit kii bhashastyli adhik saahitiyik or kaavyatmak he
 But it is different from the ornate and artistic prose style of Subandhu and Baan
 kathamoolak alankrita style ke chamatkaar kii paripakvata yadhyapi subandhu main praudh or baan main praudhatar he, tathaapi un donon main varnya vastu or paatro kaa charitrankan 'dashakumarcharit' kii apeksha dhoomil he
 The artistic idealist has made the style of 'vasavadatta' and 'kadambari' somewhat artificial by moving away from the reality
 par dandi kii gadhykavyastylee main us 'ati' or sayaastaa kaa prabhaav simaatikrami nahin he
 'daskumarcharit' is probably influenced by the story of Gunadhya with paischi language
 sambhavat: isi kaaran 'dashakumarcharit' par lokkathaon kii katharoodhiyon kaa bhi prabhaav padaa he
 The composition of adding the second, third etc
 series to the story is also targeted here
 isamen saatvin aathvin shatabdi ke samaaj kii durbalataaon or sabaltaaon, us kaal ke sankuchit or swarthparak raajnneetik sangharshon, naanaa varg ke vyaktiyon kii kamarthamulak kamajoriyon evam tadyugin samaaj kii andharudhiyon, andhvishwaason tathaa saidhantik or vyaavhaarik vaishamyon kaa atyant jeevant chithran miltaa he
 In the hierarchical characterization done through various categories and classes, a lively tableau of the society is seen
 kul milakar yugavishesh ke yatharth jivan kaa kavi ne paryaapt ankan kiya he
 Almost all scholars do not consider the five exorcisms of the antechamber of this book and the portion of the north pedestal to be punished
 unhen anya lekhakon dwaara likhit sweekaar karte hai
 The style of expression of the antechamber and antarithika is different from the eight eaves of the middle
 donon main manyatavishyak varnyamanyata bhi bhinn bhinn drushtiyon kaa sanket karti he
 It may have corrupted the opening and ending portions, but certainly the portion between the two pedigrees is devoid of undertaking and epilogue
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki is granthrachana kii yojana, jo dandi ke man main thi, pashachi kii 'brihatkatha' kii anugamini thi
 Even though the idea of collecting a large collection of folklore was there, it remained incomplete
 kuch log is granth ko nitivishyak yaa upadeshaarth rachit maanate hai
 But its composition is mainly poetic and has been made for aesthetic taste
 isamen kahin-kahin jo ashleelata dosha bataaya jaataa he vah thodaa bahut vaisaa hi he jaisaa 'kumarasambhav', naishadhacharit', 'shishupal vadh' yaa 'kiratarjunium' main
 The word number used by Dandi in 'dasakumarcharit' is more pronounced than the words used in 'kadambari' or 'vasavadatta'
 in tathaa anya kaarnon se sanskrit ke gadhykavyakaron main dandi kaa sthaan vishisht he
 Kavyadarsha is such a composition of Dandi which is of special importance from the idea of poetry
 drishykavy sambandhi 'naatyashaastra' ke ananthar keval 'bhamah' hi dandi se pracheenatar aise alankarik hai jinka granth adyavadhi uplabdh he
 But Dandi's 'poetry' is more mature, more comprehensive and more systematic than his work 'kavyalankar'
 usne parvarti anek alankarikon ke granthon or unki rachanastyli ko prabhavit kiya he
 'avantisundarikatha' is also an adult prose
 parantu uske krititv ke vivaadaaspad or granth ke apurna hone main yahan vishesh kuch na kahkar itnaa hi kahana paryaapat he ki vah ek praudh gadhykavy he
 It may also be that she had been a predecessor of 'dashkumarcharit'
 sab milakar dandi ko ham utkrisht kavyakaar or tadyugin shastrabodh kii drushti se ucch koti kaa alankarik kah sakate hai
