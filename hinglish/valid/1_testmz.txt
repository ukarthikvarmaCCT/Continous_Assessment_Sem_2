 Historiography or historiography makes sense of two things - the study of the development and methodology of history and the collected material related to the history of a subject
 itihaaskaar itihaashshastra kaa adhyayan vishyavaar karte hai, jaise- bharat kaa itihaas, japani samrajya kaa itihaas aadi
 The mainstay of history are the epochs and remains of the site which are found in some form or the other
 jivan kii bahumukhi vyapaktaa ke kaaran swalp saamagree ke sahare vigat yug athwa samaaj kaa chitranirmaan karnaa du:saadhy he
 The more the material gets, the more proportionally it becomes possible to present the outline of the bygone era and society
 paryaapt sadhano ke hote hue bhi yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki kalpanamishrit chitra nishchit rup se shuddh yaa satya hi hoga
 Therefore, due to lack of appropriate attention, some scholars say that the entirety of history is irretrievable, yet if our experience and knowledge is abundant, our art is rationalized for the investigation of historical material and imagination is controlled and developed, then our picture of the past Can be more humane and authentic
 saransh yah he ki itihaas kii rachana main paryaapt saamagree, vaigyanik dhang se uski jaanch, usase praapt gyaan kaa mahatv samajhane ke vivek ke saath hi saath aitihaasak kalpana kii shakti tathaa sajiv chithran kii kshamta kii aavashyaktaa he
 It should be remembered that history is neither a science by ordinary definition nor a mere imaginary philosophy or literary work
 in sabake yathochit sanmishran se itihaas kaa swaroop rachaa jaataa he
 History is more or less the same type of truth as science and philosophy
 jis prakaar vigyaan or darshanon main herpher hote hai usee prakaar itihaas ke chithran main bhi hote rahete hai
 With the help of man's increasing knowledge and resources, the paintings of history continue to be cremated, their antiquity and culture
 prayek yug apane-apane prashn uthaata he or itihaas se unka samaadhaan dhundhata rahata he
 That is why every era, society or person keeps on observing history with the vision of their questions
 yah sab hote hue bhi sadhano kaa vaigyanik anveshan tathaa nirikshan, kalkram kaa vichaar, paristhiti kii aavashyaktaaon tathaa ghatnaon ke pravaah kii baariki se chaanbin or unase parinaam nikaalane main sartakta or sanyam kii anivaaryta atyant aavashyak he
 Without them, there would be no difference between historical imagination and fantasy
 itihaas kii rachana main yah avashya dhyaan rakhana chahie ki usase jo chitra banaaya jaae vah nishchit ghatnaon or paristhitiyon par dridhtaa se aadhaarit ho
 Attempting to support mental, imaginary or arbitrary forms by historical events is strictly prohibited due to unforgivable defects
 yah bhi samaran rakhana aavashyak he ki itihaas kaa nirmaan bauddhik rachanaatmak kaary he atev aswabhaavik or asambhavya ko pramankoti main sthaan nahin diya ja saktaa
 Apart from this, the aim of history is to get specific knowledge
 kisi vishesh siddhant yaa mat kii pratishtha, prachaar yaa niraakaran athwa use kisi prakaar kaa andolan chalaane kaa saadhan bananaa itihaas kaa durupyog karnaa he
 By doing this, the importance of history is not destroyed, but instead of benevolence, it begins to degrade, which ultimately results in horrific consequences

9 karod ise duusari bhashaa ke rup main bol sakate hai, jo ise angrezi or german ke baad sangh kii teesri sarvaadhik boli jane vaali bhashaa banaata he
 Additionally, prior to the overthrow of English in the early 20th century, French was the principal language of diplomacy and dialogue between European and colonial powers, as well as the colloquial language of the educated class of Europe
 likhi hui francisi main agar shabd ke ant main agar ye vyanjan aate hai : s, t, f, c, q,, x, p, n, m, to saadharantaya inkaa uccharan nahin hota
 So if it is spelled français, it will be pronounced French, not Frances
 "na" or "m" swaron ko nasiky bana sakate hai
 Other consonants are often pronounced when they come at the end of a word
 par agar koi francisi ke apane uccharan niyamon ko acchhee tarah samaj jaye to wo maan jaayegaa ki isamen angrezi se behatar niyambaddhata he

 The theory of relativity or relativity, or just relativity, is a fundamental theory of modern physics developed by Albert Einstein and has two major parts - specific relativity and general relativity
 phir bhi kai baar aapekshikta yaa relativity shabd ko gallilian invariens ke sandarbh main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term, called Theory of Relativity, was first used by Max Planck in 1906
 yah angrezi shabd samooh "relative theory" se liya gaya tha jisamen yah bataaya gaya he ki kaise yah siddhant principal of relativity kaa prayog karata he
 In the discussion section of this paper, Alfred Booker used "theory of Relativity" for the first time
 aapekshikta siddhant sankshep main yah he ki 'nirpeksh' gati tathaa 'nirpeksh' twaran kaa astitv asambhav he, arthath 'nirpeksh gati' evam 'nirpeksh twaran' shabd vastut: nirarthak hai
 If 'absolute motion' had meaning, then it could be certain without referring to other bodies
 parantu sab prakaar se cheshtaa karne par bhi kisi pind kii 'nirpeksh' gati kaa pataa nishchit rup se prayog dwaara pramanit nahin ho sakaa he or ab to aapekshikta siddhant bataata he ki aisa nishchit karnaa asambhav he
 a new approach in physics started with relativity theory
 aapekshikta siddhant ke aane se bhautikee ke katipay puraane siddhanton kaa drudh sthaan dig gaya or anek moulik kalpanaaon ke vishay main sookshm vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa dikhaai dene lagi
 In science, the function of theory is often to systematically formulate known fruits and then to test new fruits from that theory by experiment
 aapekshikta siddhant in donon kaaryon main safal rahaa he
 By the end of the 19th century, physics was developing according to Newton-inspired theories
 prayek nae avishkaar athwa praayogic fal ko in siddhanton ke drushtikon se dekha jaataa tha or aavashyak nai pariklpanaayen banaai jaati thim
 Among them was the ubiquitous ether
 ether ke astitv kii kalpana karne ke do pramukh kaaran the
 Firstly, a medium like ether was required for the vibration of electromagnetic waves to propagate from one place to another
 dwitiya, yantriki main newton ke gati vishyak samikarnon ke liye, or jis parshwabhoomi par ye sameekaran aadhaarit the uske liye bhi, ek pramanik nirdeshak kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Specific properties were applied to the ether to accurately assess the fruits of the experiments
 ether sarvyaapee samajha jaataa tha or sampurna dishaao main tathaa pindon main bhi uskaa astitv mana jaataa tha
 In this stable ether, objects could travel without resistance, it was imagined
 in gunon ke kaaran ether ko nirpeksh maanak samajhane main koi baadha nahin thi
 Light speed 3x108 m
 Per second, it was known and waves of light are radiated at this speed relative to 'stationary' ether, it was imagined
 yantriki main veg, twaran, bal ityadi ke liye bhi ether nirpeksh maanak samajha jaataa tha
 In the second half of the 19th century, many attempts were made to experiment with the existence of ether and to establish its properties
 inamen micelsonmorle kaa prayog vishesh mahatvapurn tathaa ullekhneey he
 The purpose of this experiment was to make an accurate measurement of the speed at which the Earth revolves around the Sun with the ether
 kintu yah praytn asafal rahaa or prayog ke fal se yah anumaan nikaala gaya ki ether ke saapeksh prithvi kii gati shunya he
 It also means that the imagery of ether is untrue, that is, ether does not exist
 yadi ether hi nahin he to nirpeksh maanak kaa bhi astitv nahin ho saktaa
 Thus, the motion can only be relative
 bhautikee main saamanyat: gati kaa maapan karne ke liye athwa fal vyakt karne ke liye kisi bhi ek paddati kaa nirdesh dekar kaary kiya jaataa he
 But in these instructional methods, no method can be 'specific', because if it were, then we could consider that 'specific' instructional method as the standard of relaxation
 anek prayogon se aisa hi fal praapt hua
 The fruits of these experiments created serious disturbance not only in physics, but also in science and philosophy
 20veen shatabdi ke prarambh main prasiddh french ganitagya ech
 poincare ne aapekshikta kaa pranium prastut kiya
 According to them the laws of physics should be expressed in such a form that they are real to any observer
 iskaa arth yah he ki bhautikee ke niyam prekshak kii gati ke upar avlambit na rahen
 This act sheds new light on the prevailing conceptions of pain and time
 is vishay main oinstin kii vichaardhaara, yadhyapi vah krantikaarak thi, prayogon ke falon ko samajhane main adhik safal rahi
 Einstein made special analysis of the fundamental words and the prevailing conceptions combined with them, such as speed, acceleration, acceleration, time, etc
 is vishleshan se yah spasht hua ki newton ke siddhanton par aadhaarit tathaa pratishthit bhautikee main trutiyaan hai
 Einstein's theory of relativity is two categories: vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is swaroop main vyakt hote hai ki ve kisi bhi atwarit prekshak ke liye samaan honge
 In the general relativity theory, the laws of physics are expressed in such a way that they will be independent or unrestrained by the motion of the observer
 vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1905 main hua or saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1915 main hua
 It was presented by Einstein in 1905 in one of his papers on the electrodynamics of moving bodies
 vishisht saapekshata do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he jo shastreey yantriki ke sankalpanaaon ke viruddh hai: The results from the theory of specific relativity are surprising; Some of these are as follows: shastreey yantriki main galileo kaa roopaantaran prayukt hota he jabaki vishisht saapekshata main lorents roopantaran 
 The theory of relativity developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1911 is known as 'general Relativity'
 yah siddhanth nimnlikhit do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he- Specific relativity theory improved the assumptions made in physics about length, distance, time, mass, energy, etc
 inke atirikt bhautikee ke kshetra main anya vishay hai jo utane hi mahatvapurn hai, kintu unka samavesh vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main nahin he
 The specific relativity principle can be used in force and electromagnetic fields, as it cannot in the gravitational field
 gurutvkarshan bhautikee kaa ek atyant mahatvapurn vibhaag he, at: spasht he ki vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ko vyapak banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The relation of mass comes in two ways in physics
 kisi pind par jab bal kaary karata he tab pind kaa sthaan badalata he or uskaa veg badalata he
 The body gets acceleration as long as the force acts
 yantriki ke niyamon ke anusaar bal, pind kaa dravyaman or twaran main nimnlikhit sambandh he : The mass m in this equation is called inertia or dependent mass
 dravyaman kaa doosraa sambandh newton ke guruttviya kshetra main aata he
 According to Newton's theory of gravity, if two masses, m1 and m2, are at a distance r, the following gravitational force f will work between them: is sameekaran main g gurutvkarshan sthiraank he
 If we consider m1 as the mass of the earth and m2 as the mass of another body near the earth, the equation will express the mass m2
 newton kii yantriki main gativigyaan tathaa gurutvkarshan swatantra or bhinn hai, kintu donon main hi dravyaman kaa sambandh aata he
 Einstein integrated the concepts used in these two independent and different divisions of the mass into his general relativity theory
 yah gyaat tha ki jadtv par ashrith dravyaman or gurutveey dravyaman samaan hote hai
 Einstein used this analogy of mass to harmonize kinetics and gravity, and in 1915 AD introduced a comprehensive relativity theory
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant ko ganit main sutrit karne kii jo paddati he vah anya paddatiyon se bhinn he
 It uses special geometry, which is different from Euclid's three-dimensional geometry
 ] ne yah bataaya ki yadi vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main dik ke teen aayam tathaa samay kaa chaturth aayam, in chaaron ayaamon ko lekar ek 'chaturaayam satati', kii kalpana kii jaae to aapekshikta siddhant adhik saral ho jaataa he
 Symmetry is not absolute - it has been proved
 isse newton pranit dik tathaa samay kii nirpekshata or swatantraaa samaapt ho jaati he
 Therefore, to express physical phenomena, the quadrant of time and time is more natural
 riman ne 'chaturaayam dik' kii kalpana karke uski jyamiti kaa jo vikaas kiya tha uskaa oinstin ne adhik upyog kiya
 In this quadrant of time and time, the principles of physics were geometrically placed in the general relativity theory
 is chaturaayam satati kaa yuclid ke teen aayam ke dik se samya he
 In the reality of three dimensions, just as a point or a place is determined by these three coordinates, the length between two points and one is also fixed
 chaturaayam satati main dik ke in teen ayaamon ke saath jab samay bhi joda jaataa he tab samay kaa aayam rup t = x0
5c-1 aata he, jahaan t = samay or c = prakaash kaa veg he
 If one observer specifies a world event, then the speed relative to that observer will be the coordinates of the same event for another observer
 lorenz ke roopantaran ke niyam yadi yatharth hon to siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki By developing the equation, similar but highly complex terms are found for any type of motion
 iske liye nishchalon or pradishon ke siddhanton kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Gravity naturally occurs in the wider relativity theory by expanding the original imaginations in this way
 uske liye vishisht pariklpanaaon kii aavashyaktaa nahin haati he
 The results of many events are the same, according to Einstein's pervasive relativity theory and Newton's pioneering mechanics
 kintu khagoliki main jab saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa upyog kiya gaya tab teen ghatnaon ke fal pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar nikle falon se kuch bhinn rahe
 From these fruits one can take the test of general relativity theory
 ye teen fal is prakaar hai: 390 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 390 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered a collective year based on the Julian calendar

 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows- uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 390 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate he

 Prophylactic measures have proved to be the most successful against infectious diseases
 sankramak rog ek vyakti se duusare vyakti ko hote hai or sookshm jeevon se utpann hote hai
 There are two major methods of immunization: yadi ham kisi vyakti ke rudhir main sandigdh rogajanak ke pratirakshiyon kii maatra kisi prakaar badha den, to vyakti kii rog-pratirodh-kshamta bad jaati he
 There are two methods to increase the titer of antibodies in the body of potential individuals: tantra main sambhddha rogajanak jeevanu ke upyukt pratijan is prakaar pravisht kar die jate hai ki rog to na utpann ho kintu aavashyak pratirakshi ban jaaen
 This is done by applying a vaccine
 kuch jeevanu, jaise diphthyria, dhanustambh aadi ke jeevanu, apane sharir se jeevvish nikaalte hai, jo sharir par dushprabhav utpann karte hai
 In such diseases, improved biology, called biochemistry, is given a needle

 They remove the effect of biology
 sakriy pratirakshan kaa dosha yah he ki pratiraksha ke preran main adhik samay lagata he or kabhi kabhi ek ek maheene ke antar par kai baar sui lagaani padati he
 But it has the advantage that this immunity is long-lasting
 chechak, diphthyria, dhanustambh, kukkurkhaansi or polio aadi se bachaane ke liye shishuon ko is vidhi se pratirakshit kiya jaataa he
 In its absence, they can become victims of some infection
 isi prakaar sainikon ko dhanustambh or gas gangrene se, jinase ve yudhakshetra main arakshit rahete hai, pratirakshit kiya jaataa he
 Whenever an epidemic like cholera, or plague spreads, the public is immunized
 jab taatkaalik pratirakshan apekshit ho, jaise rog ke prabhaav main aa chuke vyaktiyon ke tantra main, tab bane banaae pratirakshi pravisht karaae jate hai
 These are obtained from various sources: vishisht chikitsiya serum - vishisht rog ke prati sakriy rup se pratirakshit ghode se yah serum praaia: praapt kiya jaataa he, yadhyapi anya pashuon ke serum bhi kaam main laae ja sakate hai
 The advantage of such a serum is that it has a high antibody content
 aisa serum kisi bhi aavashyak maatra main praapt ho saktaa he
 The drawback of this serum is that its protein is different from the protein of human body
 at: in proteinon ke prati allergic manushyon main serum pratikriyaayein detaa he
 Important examples of such serums are antidepressurea serum, anti-tetanus serum, antigasgangrine serum
 ati pratirakshit serum - isamen or uparyukt chikitsiya serum main antar yah he ki ise manushyon se praapt kiya jaataa he, na ki anya pashuon se
 It is made from the blood of such humans, in which extraordinary resistance has been generated by repeatedly applying the appropriate antigen needle
 upashmi serum - yah madh: rogayukt manushya se praapt kiya jaataa he
 Due to the immunity that a person produces when he is free from any specific infection, he has an effective quality
 paryaapt maatra main praapt na hone ke kaaran isaki upyogita bahut simit he
 Gamma globulin - Most of the antibodies found in human serum are limited in the gamma globulin fraction
 jin bacchon main masoorika ke sankraman kii ashanka hoti he unhen gamma globulin kii sui dwaara, pratirakshan pradaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Encouraging addition of gamma globulin has also been found as a prophylactic measure in the polio epidemic

 The globulin of the trade is derived from the placenta
 jab manushya kisi sanchari rog ke kshetra main kuch samay rah chukaa hota he, tab vah roganirodhan ke liye kuch pratijaiviki or rasayan chikitsiya oshadhiyon kaa prayog kabhi kabhi karata he

 The kuli-begar movement was a non-violent movement in 1921 by the general public in Bageshwar Nagar, North India
 is aandolan kaa netritv badri dutt pande ne kiya, tathaa andolan ke safal hone ke baad unhen 'kumaun kesari' kii oopaadhi di gayi
 The purpose of this movement was to put pressure on the British to end the coolie labor practice
 andolan se prabhavit rashtrapita mahatma gandhi ne ise 'raktahin kranti' kaa naam diya
 Pulling the work of a porter from the common man without remuneration was called a porter
 vibhinn graamon ke pradhanon kaa yah daayitv hota tha, ki vah ek nishchit avadhi ke liye, nishchit sankhya main kuli shaasha varg ko uplabdh karaayegaa
 For this work, the head also had a register, in which the names of all the villagers were written and everyone was forced to do this in turn
 pradhano, jamidaaro or patwaariyon ke mileebhagat se va aapasi bhed-bhav ke kaaran janata ke bich asantosh badhata gaya kyonki gaanv ke pradhan va patawaari apane vyaktigat hiton ko saadhane yaa bair bhav nikaalane ke liye is kuriti ko badhaava dene lage
 People started gathering against this evil practice
 kabhi-kabhi to logon ko atyant ghrunit kaam karne ke liye bhi majaboor kiya jaataa tha
 For example, the British carry less or less dirty clothes
 angrejo dwaara kuliyon kaa shaareerik va maansik rup se dohan kiya ja rahaa tha, iske virodh main bhi log paraspar ekajute hone lage
 First of all, the Chand rulers used to represent the 'ghodals', a tax related to horses in the state, it was probably an early form of the coolie labor practice
 aage chal gorkhaon ke shashan main is pratha ne vyapak rup le liya lekin va angrejon ne apane praarambhik kaal main hi ise samaapt kar diya
 But gradually the British not only re-enforced this system but also brought it to its powerful form
 pehle yah kar tab aam janata par nahin varan un malgujaaron par aropit kiya gaya tha jo bhu-swaamiyon yaa jamidaaron se kar vasula karte the
 Therefore, this practice was directly affected by the tenants who owned the land
 par vaastaviktaa ke dharaatal par sach yah tha in sampann bhu-swami va jamidaaron ne apane hisson kaa kuli begaar, bhoomi viheen krishakon, mazdooron va samaaj ke kamjor tabakon par lad diya jinhone ise sashart paarishramik ke rup main sweekaar liya
 Thus, this practice continued despite occasional protests

 But the rebellion of the suppression of that time kept splitting up in various forms of resistance from time to time
 isamen angrejon dwaara kumau ke jangalon kii kataan or unke dohan se upja hua asantosh bhi tha
 This dissatisfaction intensified once again in the first half of the twentieth century as a 'coolie rebellion' broke out
 1913 main kuli begaar yahaan ke nivaasiyon ke liye anivaary kar diya gaya
 It was opposed everywhere, Badri Dutt Pandey led this movement
 almoda akhbaar ke madhyam se unhone is kuriti ke khilaaf janajagran ke saath-saath virodh bhi prarambh kar diya
 In 1920, an annual session of the Congress was held in Nagpur, in which people like Pt Govind Ballabh Pant, Badridatta Pandey, Har Gobind Pant, Victor Mohan Joshi, Shyam Lal Shah etc
 attended and Badri Dutt Pandey took blessings from Mahatma Gandhi for the Coolie forced labor movement
 And came back and started a public awareness against this evil practice
 14 janvari, 1921 ko uttarayani parv ke avasar par kuli begaar aandolan kii shuruyaat hui, is aandolan main aam aadmi kii sahabhaagita rahi, alag-alag gaanvon se aaye logon ke hujum ne ise ek vishaal pradarshan main badal diya
 This movement originated from the confluence of Saryu and Gomti
 is aandolan ke shuru hone se pehle hi jiladhikari dwaara pan0 hargobind pant, lala chiranjeelal or badri dutt pande ko notice thama diya lekin iskaa koi asar unpar nahin hua, upasthit jansamooh ne sabase pehle bagnath ji ke mandir main jaakar puja-archana kii or phir 40 hajaar logon kaa juluus sarayu bagad kii ore chal padaa, juluus main sabase aage ek jhanda tha, jisamen likhaa tha “kuli begaar band karo”, iske baad sarayu maidan main ek sabha hui, is sabha ko sambodhit karte huye badridatt pande ji ne kaha “pavitra sarayu kaa jal lekar bagnath mandir ko sakshi maanakar pratigya karo ki aaj se kuli utaar, kuli begaar, bardaayis nahin denge
 "all the people took this oath and the head of the villages brought with them the coolie register, torn these coolie registers and flowed them to the confluence between the slogans of conch sound and Bharat Mata ki Jai
 almoda kaa tatkaaleen dipti kamishnar diabal bheed main maujuud tha, usne bheed par goli chalaani chaahi, lekin police bal kam hone ke kaaran vah ise moort rup nahin de paaya
 After this successful movement, the public gave the title of Kumaon Kesari to Badri Dutt Pandey, this movement was not only supported by the people but also strictly followed and the people continued to protest against this practice
 isaki pariniti yah hui ki sarkaar ne sadan main ek vidheyak laakar is pratha ko samaapt kar diya
 Mahatma Gandhi was greatly influenced by this movement and came to Bageshwar himself and established the Gandhi Ashram at Chanonda
 iske baad gandhi ji ne yang india main is aandolan ke bare main likhaa ki “iskaa prabhaav sampurna tha, yah ek raktahin kranti thi

 It also attempts to identify plausible correlations and provide recommended actions
 lakshya raay ke upyog ke liye data or metric sthanapann karne ke liye he
 Almost everyone has now heard of Google's free food, 20% of the time, and wide range of fun activities, but each of these is based on data that was implemented and maintained
 main apane data par hi aadhaarit drushtikon ko ujagar karne ke liye google ke ateet or vartmaan logon ko prabandhan ke tareekon ke apane " sheersh 10" soochibaddh kiya he google ke logon vishleshiki drushtikon se kai to asaamaanya or shaktishaalee hai, main keval " 
 lubhaavni " ke rup main unhen kaa varnan kar sakate hai: Leadership characteristics and the role of managers - their "project Oxygen" research analyzed the reams of internal data and determined that great managers are required to maintain and maintain top performance
 It further identified eight characteristics of great leaders
 Data Even better technical knowledge, staff and position as the number 1 key to being a successful leader consistently expressed interest in personal opinion LI, who proved from periodic one to one coaching that
 Managers are rated twice a year by their employees on their performance on eight factors

 yah logon ke prabandhan or ek utpaadak paryaavaran ko banaae rakhane ke liye sabase prabhavi drushtikon nirdhaarit karne ke liye google ke bheetar lagu prayogon kaa aayojan karata he
 The lab also improved employee health by relying on scientific data and experiments to reduce the calorie intake of its employees at its eating facilities
 The retention algorithm - to predict which is likely to become a staff retention problem consistently and successfully
 a mathematical algorithm is developed
 yah drushtikon bahut der ho chuki he isse pehle prabandhan kaary karne kii anumati detaa he or yah aage pratidhaaran samaadhaan vyaktigat ja karne kii anumati detaa he
 Predictive Modeling - People are looking at Google ahead of management
 natijatan, yah bhavishya kahanevaala model viksit or lagaataar aagaamee logon prabandhan kii samasyaon or avasaron ke apane purvanumaan main sudhaar karne ke liye "kya hua agar " vishleshan kaa upyog karen
 It also uses analytics to build a more effective workforce plan, which is essential in a fast growing and changing firm
 vividhta main sudhaar - sabase fermon ke vipareet, vishleshiki vividhta kii samasyaon ko hal karne ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 As a result, the people analytics team conducted analysis to identify the root causes of weak diversity recruitment, retention, and promotions
 yah bhartee, pratidhaaran, or padonnati main utpaadit parinaam he ki naatakeey or madhyam the
 An Effective Hiring Algorithm - Approach to Scientifically Hiring One of the few companies, it has developed an algorithm for predicting which candidates were most likely to succeed after they have hired

 Under Project Janus, it has developed an algorithm for every major work family that they rejected to identify any top candidates who may then analyze the system

 Calculating the value of top performers - Google executives have calculated the performance difference between an extraordinary technologist and an average
 sheersh kalakaaron kaa mulya sabit, kiraaya banaae rakhane, or asaadhaaran pratibha ko viksit karne ke liye aavashyak sansaadhan uplabdh karaane ke liye adhikariyon ko manaa

 Workplace Design Drive Collaboration - Google has an exceptional focus on increasing collaboration among employees from various functions
 khoj, sahyog, or mazaa : yah vruddhi hui navachaar teen karkon ke sangyojan se aata he ki paaya gaya he
 It intentionally designs its workplaces to maximize education, fun, and collaboration
 Managing 'fun' may seem superfluous to do something, but the data indicates that it is a major factor in attraction, retention, and collaboration
 khoj or seekhney ko badhanaa - bajaay paaramparik kaksha seekhney par dhyaan kendrit jor par seekhney par haath he
 Google has grown through learning from failures, discovering and learning through Project Rocker, and even inviting external speakers such as Al Gore and Lady Gaga to talk to their employees
 jaahir he aatm nirdeshit lagaataar seekhney or anukool karne kii kshamta google par pramukh karmchaaree dakshataon hai
 It is not fixed, it is forbidden with data - not during the analysis phase when Google is the ultimate key to the success of the people analytics team, but when instead of presenting its final proposals to executives and managers
 Rather than forcing managers to demand or accept their point of view, it instead serves as internal advisors and influences people to change based on powerful data and recommendations that they present
 apane darshakon ke rup main atyadhik vishleshnatmak hote hai, kyonki yah purv nirdhaarit raay badalane ke liye or prabhavit karne ke liye data kaa upyog karata he
 Google is a talent competitor for its company aap ek ucch takanic company main kaam nahin karte hai, to yah google aapako match ke liye nahin he ki ek form he ki galat dharna banane ke liye aasaan he
 But the truth is that what Google does has a lot to do with most high tech
 google anivaary rup se apane vigyaapan ke liye lakshya ko aakarshith karne ke bare main jaankaree khojane or vargeekrut karne par nirbhar karata he ki ek vigyaapan company he
 It also allows more of its advertisements to be seen by its users, as it also focuses on mobile phones
 aap software ejeeniyar kiraaya nahin he, bhale hi apane form vitt main kisi bhi udyog main kisi bhi form main kaam kar sakate hai
 a quick look at Google's job openings will show you that it hires almost every field, including distinctly non-engineering professions, including nursing, automotive, sustainability, entertainment, telephony, and advertising
 sheersh kalakaaron or naveen avishkaron ab fluidly udyogon ke bich le jate hai, to aap apane form par vichaar kar rahe hai, jo sabase acha ummidavaaron google par kaam karne kaa mauka par kud nahin hoga ki agar aapako lagata he, aap bas data ko dekha nahin he
 Like it or not, you realize that competing with Google every day for top talent is the time for executives at every major firm
 google ek " pratibha chumbak " he or aap apni bhartee kii kshamta se mail nahin khate hai, to aap har kaam ke parivaar main mahatvapurn naveen avishkaron or sheersh kalakaaron ko kho denge
 Once an executive knows that Google is a direct talent competitor to top talent and innovators, they often get frustrated almost immediately with their own firm's conservative employer branding and hiring approach
 google kai saalon ke liye sabhi naukariyon ke liye number 1 niyokta brands rahaa he
 If you want average workers, then you definitely don't have to worry about Google's recruiting power, but if you want the best, it's your talent competitor in almost every work class and location, like doing this job
 Time for aap saadhaaran parinaamon ko praapt hoga guarantee detaa he ki " ham aisa kabhi nahin kar saktaa " Almost without exception, they present an almost universally consistent response when i present Google's best practices to executives or HR leaders
 pratikriya yaa "ham aisa kabhi nahin kar saktaa " yaa to he "yah hamaari samskruti feet nahin hota 
 " My first answer to those types of comments is the best way to become a great company
 

 bold logon ko prabandhan ke tareekon ko apnaane se inkaar karke " ek mahaan form 
 tarah kaam karte hai, " kya aap dur naveen avishkaron drive karenge ki guarantee he ki he
 You don't believe me, just interview a number of innovators and you demand to operate in an environment where they insist and even the firm takes bold action, takes major risks, and innovates Provides innovators with freedom and resources that will be found
 Invention and top performers and they see as a roadblock that change and remove their culture, "wow
" If one would not allow their culture to excel, bold and aggressive recruitment, retention, and people management methods
 That can gravitate towards companies and opportunities
 apane form ke bheetar parivartan kii gati apni form ke baahar parivartan kii gati kii tulana main dhimi he, to apane form ke neeche sarpil dur nahin he
 Also be aware that no top performer wants to work for a steady or declining firm
 nirantar sudhaar abhinav kaa dushman ho saktaa he Setting goals is critical to success in any firm
 haalanki, kuch companiyaan ab ki 6 sigma or nirantar sudhaar ke lakshyon ko anjaane main navachaar ko kam karne or betahasha safal hone se apni form rakhane ja saktaa he nekaniyat paa rahe hai
 The CEO of Google actually warns against continuous improvement, and as a result, he has set extraordinary goals for his employees to create "products and services that are 10 times better than the competition
" a 


 "1,000% improvement requires reconsideration which explains the problems fully, discovering the edges of what is technically possible, and in the process a lot more Zsa coming
 " google kii safalataa aap apane sudhaar ke lakshyon ko bahut kam set 


 yadi aap durbhaagya se vastav main unhen maar saktaa he ki sabit karne main madad mili he
 Its commercial success has been impressive ke rup main adwitiya or prabhaavshaalee apane logon vishleshiki drushtikon ke rup main, Analytics kii asli shakti yah utpaadan karne main madad karata he ki vyapaar parinaamon ke madhyam se pradarshan kiya he
 In addition to being in the top three in market value, Google has also produced the success of these impressive businesses
 khoj kii duniya main number 1 chaudaasmartphone oparating system kii bikri main number 2 fortune sabase prashansa kii companiyon kii suchi main number 2fast company kii sabase naveen companiyon par number 3duniya kii sabase majboot utpaada brandon ke bich number 3bijnes sheersh 50 pradarshan fermon main soochibaddapani adbhut laire pej glassdoor
com se mukhya kaaryakari adhikariyon ke bich number 4 sthaan par theantim vichaar Google is a "talent magnet" firm and said it is its primary driver of success in football, as is the Yankees in New York Baseball and for Barcelona
 yah aakarshith karti he or asaadhaaran pratibha ko barkaraar rakhe hue hai or yah vistaar he or yah kisi bhi nae kshetra yaa naukari ke parivaar main he ki pratibha ko aakarshith kar sakate hai kyonki viksit kar sakate hai kyonki yah betahasha safal he
 As a result, the primary reason to learn from copy and Google is that you can successfully attract and retain the same ability of top talent and innovators, your firm also your current industry, but any industry or product line Not just dominating, you have chosen to go in
 aap bhi apni form kii kam kshamta logon ke prabandhan ke tareekon vastav main ucch margin utpaadon or sevaaon ke utpaadan se apni form simit kar rahe hai ki alag sambhaavna par vichaar karnaa chahie
 Unfortunately most executives are not aware of Google's analytical approach
 ve drushtikon samajhane ke baad, haalanki, adhikariyon jaldi se antar dekh sakate hai or yah nirnay har duusare bade vyapaarik samaaroh main kiya jaataa he ki jis tarah se mail khaataa he, kyonki ve vishleshnatmak model pasand karte hai
 Google's business impact has been proven as "changing office," the time has come for the last bastion of non-analytical decisions to shift to a data-based model
 aap bas tum upaay nahin he kya sudhaar nahin kar sakate, or maanav sansaadhan kii itnaa sab par mapa kharaab mapa yaa nahin he
 One remaining major problem is severely lacking in many math, predictive analytics, and statistics fields in the office, so they may not be able to make the shift
 ve " ve kya karte hai " reinvented hone ke saath sahaj mahasoos nahin karte kyonki anya maanav sansaadhan paramparawaadi, jo bas ko roak saktaa he
 Look at the extraordinary success that both Google and Apple have produced after they shifted to becoming "innovative companies" and talent magnets
 Both have literally gone somewhere in the market landscape and a competitive landscape for product dominance within the past decade
 aap unki safalataa unke bhawanon or upkarnon par aadhaarit tha ki maan or unhen nakal karne kii koshish kar saktaa he
 Although it would not take long to find out that you have the ability to attract and manage innovators, rather than buildings or equipment
 The game has changed, and it is now the largest or oldest firms to win
 iske bajaay, yah jeet us sabase naveen avishkaron ke saath fermon he
 And in the future, the need for innovators will only increase

 During his reign, policies of deep Islamization followed in Pakistan

 Apart from these, the basic ideas of Parsi, Jain and Christianity were also included
 haalaanki is dharm ke prachaar ke liye usne zyada kuch nahi kiya keval aapane vishwast logon ko hi isamen sammalit kiya
 It is said that apart from Akbar, only King Birbal was a follower till his death
 dabestan-e-majahab ke anusaar akbar ke pashchaat keval 19 logon ne es dharm ko apanaaya kalantar main akbar ne ek nae panchang kii rachana kii jisamen kii usne ek ishwariya samvath ko armbh kiya jo akbar kii rajbhishek ke din se prarambh hot tha
 He wrote allahu-akbar on the back of the then coins which was the word Anakarthi
 akbar kaa shabdic arth he "mahaan" or allahu-akbar shabd ke do arth ho sakate the "allaah mahaan hai " yaa "akbar hi allaah hai"
 deen-e-ilahi was like an ethic and not a religion in the true sense
 isamen bhoga, ghamand, ninda karnaa yaa dosha lagaana varjit the evam inhen paap kaha gaya
 Kindness, thoughtfulness and moderation were its pillars
 akbar prasiddh tirth, kurukshetra pahunchaa
 There is a big fair on solar eclipse even today
 log snaan karte hai
 At that time, some sage-recluse also came to bathe in the pool of Kurukshetra, but there was a dispute among them which party should bathe first
 aaj bhi pehle snaan karne par jhagada hota he
 Therefore, when this dispute could not be settled, both parties requested the king
 donon ke hi apane-apane daawey the, par badshaah ko koi bhi nishchit pramaan na mil sake
 It seems, the young man Akbar thought of some pranks
 usne kaha- donon aapas main lard len, jis dal kii jeet ho jaae vahi pehle snaan kare
 a party complained that there were more people in the opposition party
 vinodi akbar ne kaha ki thik he, jiske paas kam aadmi hon, vah utane hi shahi sainik le le
 What was it then, someone caught someone's beard, someone got someone's hair
 is ghamaasan kaa bada mazedaar chithran akbar-naame kii shahi prati main hua
 Painters accompanying Akbar have painted the event
 chitra ko dekhne se gyaat hota he ki dur par khadaa ghudsavaar akbar bhi is tamaashe kaa mazaa le rahaa tha
 There were also Jains in Akbar's court, it is said by both Badauni and Abul Fazl
 do pramukh jain muni hir vijayaji tathaa unke shishy vijaysen suri uske darbar main aae
 Both of these were Shwabantar Jains
 inamen hir vijayaji suri ko to 1584 i
 main akbar kaa farmaan praapt hua kiparyushan parv main jeev hinsa na ho
 People should not commit violence in front of Jains and do not eat meat
 hir vijayaji ke prati akbar kii badi shraddha rahi hogi
 Abul Fazl has written that he was a religious man of the highest order
 inke prabhaav se akbar ko jeev hinsa ke prati aruchi hui or usne kai khaas tithiyon par apane samrajya main jeev hinsa kii manaahi kar di
 He himself became against meat eating
 usne swayan prayek shuukravaar shaakaahaari bhojan karne kaa vrath le liya
 Akbar realized that all religions have the same purpose
 atah usne sarvadharm samanvay arthath sab dharmon kii acchhee baaten lene kaa maarg pakadaa
 This is what he called 'reconciliation family'
 is tarah sab dharmon kii acchhee baton ko lekar usne deen-e-ilaahi chalaaya
 In this, the monotheism of Islam, according to Zoroastrianism, the sun and fire were revered as the light and glory of that god
 hindu or jain dharmon ke ahimsawad kii is dharm par gahari chhap thi
 It has been argued that din-i-ilahi's doctrine of having a new religion is a misconception, which was later born out of the mistranslation of Abul Fazl's works by British historians
 haalanki, yah bhi sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki sulah-e-kul kii niti, jisamen deen-i-ilaihi kaa saar tha, akbar ne keval dharmik uddeshyon ke liye nahin balki saamaanya shahi prashasnic niti kaa ek bhaag ke rup main apanaaya tha
 This formed the basis of Akbar's policy of religious sympathy
 1605 main akbar kii maut ke samay unke muslim vishyon main asantosh kaa koi sanket nahin tha, or abdul haq jaise ek dharamshastri kii dharna thi ki nikat sambandh bane rahe
 As Emperor, Akbar considered it his duty to get under the religious elements
 ek baar vah fatehpur sikri main praatavkaal ekant main shila par baitha to uske man main yah bhaavana ai ki apni praja main bhedbhaav nahin rakhana chahie
 On the other hand, Mullahs of Islam used to advise persecution of non-muslims
 inke vaad-vivaad itane ugr hone lage ki badshaah ke saamne bhi ve darbari tahjeeb kaa dhyaan na rakhte
 Akbar's tendency to search for truth grew more in this mind
 akbar-namaa main abul fazal likhata he ki iske baad darbar main sabhi dharmon or sampradaayon ke vidwaan bhar gaye
 Everyone's religious beliefs would be considered
 yadi unamem koi kamajori hoti to use prakat kiya jaataa
 Religious tolerance was used, it would envy the wicked and the wicked
 akbar jab aantarik jhagadon se mukt hua to uskaa dharm-sudhaar kii ore dhyaan gaya
 He established a new religion
 isamen usne pavitra quran, brahmanon ke dharamshastra or isa messiah ke upadeshon kaa samanvay kiya
 For this he held a meeting
 isamen sabhi dharmon ke aacharyon ko bulaayaa, saath hi apane manasabadaaron ko bhi bulaayaa
 tha dhyaan dene kii baat he ki sabhi dharmon ke kattarpanthi anuyaayiyon ne akbar ke udaartaapurna drushtikon kaa virodh kiya
 On this, Akbar said- 'under any empire, it is unfair that the public be divided into many religions
 isse aapas main matbhed utpann hota he
 There are as many parties as many religions
 unamem aapas main shatruta hoti he atev sabhi dharmon main samanvay apekshit he
 But it should be done in such a way that despite being one, their specialty remains
 isse sabhi dharmon kii achchhaayiyaan bani rahengi or duusare dharmon kii visheshtaayen bhi aa jaayengi
 This will increase respect for God, peace in the people and security of the empire
 ' The European travelers have said that Akbar's eyes would keep on looking as if the sun was shimmering on the ocean
 uski aawaaj unchi thi, usamen ek anugoonj hoti thi
 If anyone had seen him, he would have known that this is the king
 jahangir kaa kathan he ki log usamen saakshaat ishwar kaa tej pate the
 He used to laugh and at that time his face would get a little deformed with laughter
 use krodh bahut hi kam aata
 He was very patient
 yorapia yatri hairaan the ki uske man kii baat chehre ke bhav se prakat hi na hoti, par krodh main uski akruti asay ho jaati thi
 His mustache hair would grow
 sanyogvash akbar shikaar khilne mathura gaya tha
 There he came to know that Hindus have to pay taxes on coming to Mathura
 usne yatri kar uthaa diya
 Akbar said - Where is the justice to be done on the worship of God! The following year, on the ninth anniversary of his coronation, he also lifted the tax-jizya imposed on non-muslims according to Muslim law
 yah ek anokhi ghatana thi
 Then there was no Jaziya tax for both generations - Aurangzeb imposed Jaziya tax after the death of Jaswant Singh in 1679
 jajia se prativarsh samrajya ko lakhon kii aay hoti
 Still Akbar considered it unfair
