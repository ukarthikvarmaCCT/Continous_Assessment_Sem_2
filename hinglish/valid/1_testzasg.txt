 They are considered to be the greatest prophet of Islam and the last messenger to whom Allah gave the message of the Quran by the angel Jibril
 musalmaan inke liye param aadar bhav rakhte hai
 Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Abdul Muttalib ibn Hashim was, in short, Muhammad, the last prophet of Islam, and re-founder
 According to Islamic principles, he was a prophet and messenger of Allah, who was sent to present and confirm the monotheistic teachings preached by Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and other prophets
 He is seen as the last Prophet of Allah in all the main branches of Islam
 Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam united the Arab State on the basis of al-quran, Sunnah and Hadiths on political and religious lines
 The central religious book of Islam, "al-qur'an", was narrated by Allah, the angel Jibril to Hazrat Muhammad from 610 to 632, which was written for the first time after the death of Hazrat
 Muslims often refer to Muhammad as Prophet Muhammad, or just Prophet
 Rasool refers to Allah, And consider him the best of all prophets
 He is seen by Muslims as the master of all virtues
 When referring to Muhammad, sallallahu alaihi wasallam is used by Muslim people, though "peace be upon them" or "peace be upon them" is also used instead, abbreviating the Arabic phrase as s

 At the age of 40, Muhammad received the first oral revelation of the Quran in a cave called Hira
 Subsequently, he was exposed to the complete Quran in a period of 23 years
 Muslims believe that Muhammad was asked by Allah to preach monotheism and print idolatry, which was practiced in eastern Arabia, at the persecution of newly converted Muslims in Mecca and the invitation of the Medina delegation, Muhammad and His followers migrated to Madina in 622 AD, this incident is called Hijrat
 Hizrat, the turning point of the life of Hazrat Muhammad, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar of Hijri

 According to the Quran, Muhammad is the last prophet in the series of prophets sent by Allah
 The Quran refers to Muhammad as "nabi", "messenger of Allah", "prophet"
 Qur'an's 2: 101, 2: 143, 2: 151, 3:32, 3:81, 3: 144, 3: 164, 4: 79-80, 5:15, 5:41, 7: 157, 8: In verses 01, 9: 3, 33:40, 48:29, and 66:09, Muhammad is called by various names, including bearers of good news, cautioners, and "who invite people to a just God Are, included
 The Quran states that Allah had sent Muhammad as "rahmat ul lil Alameen" for truth and love for the world
 allaah kuran ke surah al-ambia 21:107 main kahata hai :to be according to kanjul iman Muhammad is mentioned in the Qur'an as "pressured", "negotiator", "god messenger", "god servant", "proclaimer", "witness", "eloquent", "warner" "reminding" " Callers are called with names like "god," "stunning", and "kanti Giver"

 The Quran also classifies some religious issues regarding Muhammad
 The most important of them is the command to follow the teachings of Muhammad, the Quran repeatedly commands people to "follow Allah and His Prophet"
 The name Muhammad appears four times in the Quran

 transafarmar yaa parinamitra ek vaidyut mashin he jisamen koi chalane yaa ghoomane vaala avyav nahin hota
 The transformer is probably the most widely used electrical instrument in electrical equipment
 yah kisi ek vidyut paripath se anya paripath main vidyut preran dwaara paraspar jude hue chaalkon ke madhyam se vidyut urja sthantarit karata he
 The transformer can only work with alternating current or voltage, not with direct current
 transformar ek-feji, teen-feji yaa bahu-feji ho sakate he
 It is the most efficient machine among all electrical machines
 aadhunik yug main parinamitra vaidyut tathaa electroni udyogon kaa abhinn ang ban gaya he
 a transformer may have one, two or more windings
 do vinding vaale transafarmar ke praathmik evam dwitiyak vinding ke pheron kii sankhya evam unke vibhavantaron main nimnlikhit sambandh hota he: It is clear from this formula that by properly selecting the number of rounds of primary and secondary winding for a given value of primary voltage, we can get the desired voltage in the secondary winding
 jab dwitiyak vinding kaa vibhavaantar praathmik vinding ke vibhavaantar se adhik hota he to aise transpharmar ko ucchayi parinamitra kehete hai
 In contrast, when the voltage of the secondary winding is less than the voltage of the primary winding, such a transformer is called a catabolic transformer
 transafarmar kaa mukhya upyog vidyut shakti ko adhik voltata yaa kam voltata main badalanaa he 
 Doing so brings convenience and efficiency in the use of electrical energy
 dhyatavya he ki adarsh transafarmar urja yaa shakti utpann nahin karata, na hi shakti kaa parivartan karata he, na hi aavriti badalata he
 Transformer used in the field of electricity sambhavat: sarvaadhik vyapak rup se upyog main aanevaala Vaidyut is Sacritra
 udyogon main disht dhara kii apeksha prayavarti dhara ko jo pramukhataa he uskaa sara shrey keval parinamitra ko he
 This is a device that results in a high current of low voltage and low current of high voltage and high current of low voltage
 yah parenaaman urja kii nunatam haani se or saadhitra main bina kisi gatiman bhaag kii sahaayta ke sampann ho jaataa he
 a 100 ampere current is required for the elimination of 10,000 watts of 100 volts
 par 10,000 kii voltata par keval ek ampiore dhara paryaapt hoti he
 Therefore, in the second case, the diameter is much less than the first and due to this, cheaper conductor is required
 parinamitra kaa kaarysanchalan micel farede kii ek adwitiya khoj par aadhaarit he, jiske anusaar paripath main prerit vidyutvahak bal, paripath dwaara paribaddh kshetra ke aarpaar chumbakeey flux ke parivartan kii samay dar ke ke baraabar hota he
 In simplest form, the transformer consists of two separate coils, which have the same magnetic circuit
 shakti ke pravaah kii disha ke anusaar parinamitra ke kundalanon kaa abhinirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 Connect the primary coil to the source of alternating current and the secondary to the load
 vidyucchumbakeey preran dwaara urja praathmik kundali se dwitiyak kundalan main sthanantarit hoti he
 The characteristics of operation of an ideal transformer are: vyavahaarat: yah adarsh sthiti dushprapya he
 The feed voltage associated with the primary coil of the transformer produces magnetic flux, which is connected to the plated core of the transformer
 parinamitra ke praathmik kundali se judi hui prayavarti voltata Ep ko ucchtam chumbakeey flux ke ghanatv Bm, patlit crode kii anuprastha kaat kaa kshetrafal A, prayavarti dhara kii aavrirti dhara kii aavriti f tathaa praathmik kundali main lapeton ko sankhya N1 ke padon main vyakt kiya jaataa he: The alternating magnetic flux generated by the current flowing in the primary coil also correlates with the wraps of the secondary coil
 praathmik or dwitiyak kundaliyon main antar keval lapeton kii sankhya kaa hota he, at: dwitiyak kundali main prerit voltata kaa prabhavi maan Thus the following ratio of primary and secondary voltage is obtained: praathmik kundali kii voltata ko badhaane ke aavashyaktaa padane par praathmik kundali main lapeton kii sakhya N1 ko dwitiyak kundali kii lapeton kii sankhya N2 se kam rakhaa jaataa he
 This type of transformer is called a high transformer and if the voltage of the primary coil is greater than the voltage of the secondary, then the number of wraps in the primary coil N1 will be larger than the number of wraps of the secondary coil N2
 is prakaar ke parinamitra ko apchaayi parinamitra kehete hai
 Generally the nature of the transformer is determined by the following: saamaanya lod par saadhaaran shakti parinamitra kii dakshata bahut adhik hoti he, jo chote uniton main 90 pratishat se lekar bade parinamitron main 98 pratishat tak vicharit hoti he
 General: The efficiency of the transformer expressed in percent can be expressed as: parinamitron kii taatkaalik dakshata or din bhar kii dakshata main antar hota he
 The control of the transformer means the relation of secondary voltage in the case of full load and secondary voltage in case of no load when the input voltage is constant
 pratishat ke rup main vyakt karne par niyantran ko adholikhit rup main paribhaashit kar sakate hai: Controls are of the order of 2 to 5 percent for small transformers and about 1 percent for elders
 transafarmar ke mukhyatah do bhaag hote hai: 1) Core - which is made of a magnetic material
 2) vinding - jo tanba, almunium yaa kisi anya suchalak ke taron athwa bas-baar se banaayi jaati he
 Apart from this, bad conductors are also used which prevent winding wheels from touching each other or from the core
 transformar tel kaa prayog ucch voltata ke parinamitron main kiya jaataa he jo brakedown shakti adhik hone se spark aadi rokte hai tathaa kor va kundliyon se ushma sokhkar use thanda karte hai
 Apart from oil and many other coolants are also used to keep the transformer cool, such as water and gas etc

 Twenty-ninth pupil Manavati narrated the story in this way - King Vikramaditya used to roam around in the night
 aise hi ek din ghoomte-ghoomte nadi ke kinare pahunch gaye
 In the moonlight night, the river water was shining and presenting a very lovely scene
 vikram chupchaap nadi tat par khadey the tabhi unke kaanon main "bachaao-bachaao" kii tej aawaaj padi
 When he ran in the direction of the voice, he saw two men battling the fast stream of the river
 gaur se dekha to unhen pataa chalaa ki ek yuvak or ek yuvati tairkar kinare aane kii cheshtaa main hai, magar nadi kii dharaayen unhen bahaakar le jaati hai
 Vikram quickly jumped into the river and caught them and brought them to shore
 yuvati ke ang-ang se yauvan chhalak rahaa tha
 She was very beautiful
 uskaa rup dekhakar apsaraayen bhi lajjit ho jaatin
 An ascetic would also leave him and give up his penance and wished to live with him as a householder
 donon kritagya hokar apane praan bachaane vaale ko dekh rahe the
 The young man told that he was going by boat with his family
 nadi ke bich main ve bhavar ko nahin dekh sake or unki nauka bhavar main ja fasi
 They tried a lot to get out of the vortex, but could not succeed
 unke parivaar ke saare sadsy us bhavar main samaa gaye, lekin ve donon kisi tarah yahan tak tairkar aane main kaamyaab ho gaye
 When the king asked for his introduction, the young man told that both are brothers and sisters and are from the country of Sarang
 vikram ne kaha ki unhen sakushal apane desh bhej diya jayega
 He then asked them to go with him and walked towards his palace
 rajmahal ke najadik jab ve pahunche to vikram ko prahariyon ne pahachaanakar pranaam kiya
 The young man and woman then came to know that the man who saved them regardless of their lives was Maharajadhiraja himself
 ab to ve or kritagyatabhari nazaron se maharaj ko dekhne lage
 On reaching the palace, he called the servants and instructed them to arrange their stay with all the facilities
 ab to donon kaa man maharaj ke prati or adhik adarbhav se bhar gaya
 The young man was very much anxious for his sister's marriage
 uski bahan rajkumariyon se bhi sundar thi, isliye vah chahta tha ki kisi raja se uski shaadi ho
 But his financial condition was not good and he was not able to succeed in his intention
 jab sanyog se raja vikramaditya so uski bhent ho gai to usne sochaa ki kyon na vikram ko uski bahan se shaadi kaa prastaav diya jaae
 As soon as this idea came, he told his sister to get ready properly and Rajmahal took him to meet him
 uski bahan jab sajkar nikali to uskaa rup dekhne laayak tha
 There is no question of a human being even fascinated by the gods on his form
 jab vah rajmahal aayaa to vikram ne usase uskaa haal-chaal poocha tathaa kaha ki uske jane kaa samuchit prabandh kar diya gaya he
 He expressed his gratitude to the king and said that he will not forget the life he did on him
 uske baad usne vikram se ek chota-sa uphaar sweekaar karne ko kaha
 The king smiled and gave his permission
 raja ko prasann dekhakar usne sochaa ki ve uski bahan par mohit ho gaye hai
 He was encouraged
 usne kaha ki vah apni bahan unako uphaar dena chahta he
 Vikram said that he has to accept his gift
 ab usko puraa vishwaas ho gaya ki vikram uski bahan ko rani bana lenge
 Then the king said that from today your sister will be known as the sister of King Vikramaditya and he will marry her with great pomp after finding a suitable groom
 vah vikram kaa munh takata rah gaya
 She did not even dream that Vikram would accept her sister's beauty and accept her as her sister
 kya koi aishwaryashaalee raja vishay-vaasana se itnaa upar rah saktaa he
 After a while, he rested and said that Udayan, the prince of Udayagiri is fascinated by the beauty of his sister and has expressed his desire to marry her
 raja ne ek pandit ko bulaayaa tathaa bahut sara dhan bhent ke rup main dekar udaygiri rajya vivaah kaa prastaav lekar bheja
 Pandit returned that evening and winds were blowing on his face
 poochne par usne bataaya ki raah main kuch daakuon ne gherkar sab kuch lut liya
 The king was shocked on hearing this
 unhen aashcharya hua ki itani acchhee shashan-vyavastha ke baavjood bhi daaku lutere kaise sakriy ho gaye
 This time he sent Pandit with a few horsemen with money
 usee raat vikram vesh badalakar un daakuon kaa pataa lagane nikal pade
 They reached the deserted place where the Pandit was looted
 ek taraf unhen chaar aadmi baithe dikh pade
 The king understood that they were robbers
 vikram ko koi guptchar samajha
 The king told them not to be afraid and described himself as a thief like them
 is par unhone kaha ki ve chor nahin balki ijjatdar log hai or kisi khaas masale par vichaar-vimarsh ke liye ekant kii khoj main yahan pahunche hai
 The king asks him not to make excuses and asks him to join his party
 tab choron ne khulaasa kiya ki un chaaron main chaar alag-alag khubiyaan hai
 One used to carry out the auspicious time of theft, the other understood the tongue of the alien animals, the third knew the art of being invisible, and the fourth did not even go from terrible to terrible torture
 vikram ne unka vishwaas jeetne ke liye kaha- "main kahin bhi chipaaya dhan dekh saktaa hoon
 "when he heard this feature, he included Vikram in his team
 uske baad unhone apane hi mahal ke ek hisse main chori karne kii yojana banaai
 Some of the treasures of the royal treasury were hidden at that place
 ve choron ko vahaan lekar aae to chaaron chor bade hi khush hue
 They happily put all the goods in the bag and started going out
 chaukas prahariyon ne unhen pakad liya
 In the morning, when he was presented as a prisoner in the court of the king, he trembled like a leaf out of fear
 unhone apane paanchave saathi ko singhaasana par arudh dekha
 They started waiting for the majestic standing scepter
 magar vikram ne unhen koi dand nahin diya
 Giving them the gratitude, he vowed not to take offense from them and ordered to use their strengths for the good of the people
 chaaron ne man hi man apane raja kii mahanata sweekaar kar lee or bhale aadamiyon kii tarah jivan yaapan kaa faisla kar liya
 The king restored him to the army
 udayan ne bhi raja vikram kii muhaboli bahan se shaadi kaa prastaav prasann hokar sweekaar kar liya
 In the auspicious time, Vikram got married to Udayan with the same grandeur as a princess

 It is just to have H-bomb as self-defense against the U
S

 The dprk’s fate must not be protected by any forces but DPRK itself"
 However, South Korean intelligence and external nuclear experts are purportedly claiming Pyongyang's claims that North Korea has tested a common atomic bomb, not hydrogen
 uttar korea ne iske pehle teen bhumigat parmaanu pareekshan kiye hue the
 These tests took place in the years 2006, 2009, and 2013, as a result of which the United Nations Security Council imposed various restrictions on North Korea

 Unlike other general court petitions, it does not require that the aggrieved party go to the court itself
 yah kisi bhi naagarik yaa swayan nyaayalay dwaara peediton ke paksh main daayar kiya ja saktaa he
 The cases of Jahiya have so far affected very wide areas, prisons and detainees, armed forces, child labor, bonded labor, urban development, environment and resources, customer affairs, education, politics and elections, public policy and accountability, human rights and the judiciary itself 
 nyaayik sakriyata or jahia kaa vistaar bahut had tak samaantar rup se hua he or janhit yachika kaa madhyam-varg ne saamanytah swaagat or samarthan kiya he
 It is pertinent here that the PIL is not defined in the Indian Constitution or any law
 yah ucchtam nyaayalay ke sanvaidhanik vyakhya se vyutpann he, iskaa koi antarrashtriya samatuly nahin he or ise ek vishisht bhartiya sanpralya ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 The idea of such petitions originated in America
 vahaan ise 'saamaajik kaarywahi yachika' kehete he
 This is the invention of the judiciary and the law made by the judge

 Although it is an important part of contemporary Indian law and order, it did not initially have a place in Indian law and order
 isaki shuruyaat achaanak nahin hui, varan kai rajnatik or nyaayik kaarnon se dhire-dhire iskaa vikaas hua
 It can be said that its concept was confirmed in the 80s, starting from the 70s
 e ke gopaalan or madras rajya cese main ucchtam nyaayalay ne samvidhan kii dhara 21 kaa shabdic vyakhya karte hue yah faisla diya ki dhara main vyakhyit 'vidhisammat prakriya' kaa matlab sirf us prakriya se he jo kisi vidhaan main likhit ho or jise vidhayika dwaara paarit kiya gaya ho
 That is, if the Indian Parliament enacts a law that deprives a person of his or her right to live, it will be valid
 nyaayalay ne yah bhi mana ki dhara 21 kii vidhisammat prakriya main prakritik nyaay yaa tarksangatta shaamil nahin he
 The Court also held that unlike the American Constitution, the Court of Indian Constitution is not supreme in every respect from the legislature and the legislature is supreme in its field
 is faisle kii kaaphi aalochana bhi hui lekin yah nirnay 25 saal se bhi zyada samay tak bana rahaa
 These were the early years of the Supreme Court when its stand was cautious and pro-legislative
 yah kaal har tarah se, aaj ke maahaul, jab nyaayik samiksha kii avadharana sthapit ho chuki he or nyaayalay ko aisi sanstha ke rup main dekha jaataa he jo nagarikon ko raahat pradaan karata he or niti-nirmaan bhi karata he jiskaa rajya ko paalan karnaa padataa he, se bhinn tha
 In subsequent rulings, the supremacy of the courts was established and in the meantime there were differences and conflicts between the legislature and the judiciary
 golak nath or punjab rajya cese main 11 jajon kii khandpeeth ne 6-5 ke bahumat se mana ki sansad aisa samvidhan sanshodhan paarit nahin kar saktaa jo moulik adhikaron kaa hanan karata ho
 In the Kesavananda Bharti and Kerala State cases, the Supreme Court quashed the Golak Nath judgment, giving far-reaching theories that Parliament did not have the power to make amendments that changed the fundamental structure of the Constitution and also held that judicial review was part of the fundamental structure is
 apatkaal ke dauraan naagarik swatantraaa kaa jo hanan hua tha, usamen ucchtam nyaayalay ke e di em jabalpur or anya or shivakant shukla cese, jiske faisle main nyaayalay ne karypalika ko naagarik swatantraaa or jeene ke adhikaar ko prabhavit karne kii swachhandata di thi, kaa bhi yogadan mana jaataa he
 This decision questioned the role of the court as the guardian of civil liberties

 It was filed on the basis of a report published in The Indian Express newspaper by an advocate which described the condition of thousands of undertrials lodged in jails in Bihar
 mukademe ke natijatan 4 xxrep 4 0 se bhi zyada kaidiyon ko reeha kiya gaya tha
 Rapid justice was considered a fundamental right, which was not being given to those prisoners

 MC Mehta and Union of India and others - In this long running case, the court ordered that about 100,000 industrial units be shifted out of Delhi from Delhi's residential areas under Delhi Master Plan and to reduce pollution in Delhi
 is faisle ne varsh 1999 ke ant main rashtriya rajdhani kshetra main audyogic ashaanti or saamaajik asthirataa ko janm diya tha or isaki aalochana bhi hui thi ki nyaayalay dwaara aam mazdooron ke hiton kii andekhi paryaavaran ke liye kii ja rahi he
 This Jahiya affected about 20 lakh people who were serving in those units
 ek or sambhddha faisle main ucchtam nyaayalay ne oktober 2001 main aadesh diya ki dilli kii sabhi saarvajanik bason ko charanbaddh tareeke se sirf si en ji eendhan se chalaaya jaae
 Because it is believed that CNG is less polluting than diesel
 haalaanki baad main yah bhi paaya gaya ki bahut kam gandhak vaala deazal bhi ek acha yaa behatar vikalp ho saktaa he
 Jahia filed in the Madras High Court by Anna DMK MP PG Narayanan, in which the court was requested to reject the application of direct to home service of Sun TV Pvt Ltd in the public interest to the Union Government 
 jahia ke durupyog kii sambhaavna hameshaa bani rahi he
 And many cases have also been criticized
 swayan ucchtam nyaayalay kaa ek cese main ye avlokan he "agar isko sahi tareeke se niyantrit nahin kiya gaya or iske durupyog ko na roka gaya, to yah aniatik haathon dwaara prachaar, pratishodh, nijee yaa rajnatik swaarth kaa hathiyaar ban saktaa he
 "chief Justice of India, KG Balakrishnan, while repeating Jahia's imperative in his speech delivered at the Singapore Law Academy on 8 October 2008, also believed that the court could arbitrarily interfere with the legislative policy decisions by Jahia and make such orders
 Those whose implementation may be difficult for the executive and thereby violate the balance of power between the organs of government
 unhone yah bhi mana ki jahia ne bematlab keson ko bhi janm diya he jinka lok-nyaay se koi sarokaar nahin he
 This has affected the main function of the court by increasing the number of lawsuits in the court and admitted that there is no investigation process in case the judges move beyond their rights

 The subject of the succession of the state is concerned with the transfer of rights and obligations of those two states, one of which is a vanishing or extinct state and the other is a successor state
 pehle athwa vilupt rajya ke adhikaar or daayitv duusare rajya ke haath main chale jate hai
 The succession of the state is of two types - purna uttaradhikaar us samay hota he jab paraajay athwa aichhik vilyan ke kaaran kaai antarrashtriya sweekrutipraapt rajya anya aise hi antarrashtriya sweekrutipraapt rajya dwaara aatmsaat kar liya jaataa he
 For example, the amalgamation or ownership of Abyssinia by Italy in 1936, or the merger of Egypt and Syria in 1958
 aanshik uttaradhikaar us samay hota he- When a territory of a state is revolted and becomes itself an internationally accepted state, such as the separation of the United States from its ancestral Britain in 1776; Or- jab abhyarpan dwaara koi rajya kisi anya rajya ke kisi pradesh par apana adhikaar sthapit kar letaa he, jaise, san 1847 main sanyukt rajya america main california kaa abhyarpan; athwa- When a fully sovereign state, losing some part of its independence, joins a Union State, or comes under the suzerainty or protection of a more powerful power, or when an imperfectly sovereign state attains the form of a fully sovereign state
 Like the disbanding of Czechoslovakia in 1938
 yah prashn abhi tak asandigdh rup se nirnit nahin ho sakaa he ki jab koi rajya kisi anya rajya kaa sthaan grahan kar letaa he to vah lupt rajya ke adhikaron or dayitvon kar uttaradhikari banataa he athwa nahin
 Some writers consider this question and go to the end that there is no succession of rights and obligations
 kuch anya logon kaa vichaar he ki uttaradhikari rajya par kuch adhikaar or daayitv to aa hi jate hai
 But no such author has accepted that all the rights and responsibilities of the lost state rest with the successor state
 vibhinn rajyon main jo paddati prachlit he, usase yah baat prakat he ki saamanyatya ye sab baaten uttaradhikaar main nahin aatin
 Due to differences in behavior and prevalence and differences in views of different authors, the treaties by which state succession is established are generally made explicit reference to these subjects
 sandhipatron dwaara uttaradhikari rajya ko tirobhoot rajya se jo adhikaar or daayitv praapt hote hai, ve is baat par nirbhar karte hai ki sandhi kis prakaar kii he
 In pure political treaties, the successor state does not get any rights or obligations and with the liquidation of the extinct state, these rights or obligations are completely abolished
 ye vyaktigat sandhiyaan hoti hai or swabhaavat: inamen pehle se aisa maan liya jaataa he ki sandhi karanevaale rajyon kaa astitv he
 But the question is still controversial whether the state-made trade treaties, extradition treaties of foreign criminals or similar treaties remain valid
 adhikansh lekhakon kaa mat he ki tirohit rajya kii samaapti ke saath ye sandhiyaan bhi samaapt ho jaati hai
 Because, in such a way, such treaties are non-political kind of treaties, but there are some political things also in them
 antarrashtriya vidhaan main aisa koi saamaanya siddhant nahin he ki uttaradhikari rajya tirohit rajya ke samvidjanit dayitvon kaa bhi uttaradhikari hota he
 If there is no such adverse rule in the treaty, then it is not normal that the successor state has received these obligations

 With the recent practice of the states, it is becoming established as a rule of international law that the successor state must respect the individual acquired rights of the known, then whether this succession is derived from the surrender of a state, whether by contract or From the rupture of the state
 saarvajanik rin ke uttaradhikaar ke sambandh main vibhinn rajyon main bhinn bhinn prakaar kii reetiyaan prachlit hai
 In statutory language, the successor state is not obliged to pay the public debts taken by the extinct state
 yah keval tabhi ho saktaa he, jab is sambandh main koi vishesh sandhi kii gai ho
 Generally, the treaties of contract or surrender mention whether the successor state will remain the debtor of the extinct state's public debt
 vilupt rajya ke vyaktigat rindaataaon ko aisa koi hastkshep kaa adhikaar nahin rahata, jisase ve uttaradhikari rajya par apane rin kaa vyaktigat rup se daawa kar saken
 Their own state can put pressure on the merging state to bear the international obligation to repay the debt of the state
