 Urdu is one of the modern Indian Aryan languages of India and Pakistan
 iskaa vikaas madhyayug main uttari bharat ke us kshetra main hua jisamen aaj pashchimi uttar pradesh, dilli or purvi punjab sammilit hai
 Its basis was on the Prakrit and Apabhramsa called 'shaurseni' and from which Khadiboli, Brajbhasha, Haryani and Punjabi etc
 were born
 musalamaanon ke bharat main aane or punjab tathaa dilli main bas jane ke kaaran is pradesh kii bolchaal kii bhashaa main farsi or arabi shabd bhi sammilit hone lage or dhire-dhire usne ek pruthak rup dhaaran kar liya
 With the establishment of the state and rule of the Muslims, it was also natural that the color of their religion, policy, way of life, ethics and thought began to be reflected in that language
 is prakaar uske vikaas main kuch aisi pravritiyaan sammilit ho gayi jinaki aavashyaktaa us samay kii duusari bhartiya bhashaaon ko nahin thi
 Khadiboli was used colloquially in western Uttar Pradesh and Delhi
 usee ke aadhaar par baad main urdu kaa saahitiyik rup nirdhaarit hua
 It took a long time, so in many parts of the country, this language developed in its own way with slight differences
 urdu kaa mul aadhaar to khadiboli hi he kintu duusare kshetron kii boliyon kaa prabhaav bhi usapar padataa rahaa
 This should have happened, because initially it was either market people or they were Sufi-fakirs who used to roam in different parts of the country and spread their ideas
 isi kaaran is bhashaa ke liye kai naamon kaa prayog hua he
 Amir Khusro called him "hindi", "hindavi" or "zabane Dehalvi"; When reached in the south, it was called "dakini" or "dakkhini", "gujari" in Gujarat; Some writers of the South also called him "zabane-ahle-hindustan"
 jab kavita or visheshtya ghazal ke liye is bhashaa kaa prayog hone laga to ise "rekhta" kaha gaya
 Later it came to be called "zabane Urdu", "urdu-e-mualla" or simply "urdu"
 europea lekhakon ne ise saadhaarant: "hindustani" kaha he or kuch angrej lekhakon ne isko "moose" ke naam se bhi sambodhit kiya he
 Many of these names also reflect the historical development of this language
 udgam kii drushti se urdu vahi he jo hindi; dekhne main keval itnaa hi antar maaloom detaa he ki urdu main arabi-farsi shabdon kaa prayog kuch adhik hota he or hindi main sanskrit shabd adhik prayog hote hai
 Its script is different from Devanagari and the use of certain idioms has changed its style and structure
 parantu saahitiyik paramparaayen or rup sab ek anya saanche main dhale hue hai
 All this has happened due to historical reasons, which can be accurately estimated from the study of its literature
 parantu isse pehle ek baat kii ore or dhyaan dena chahie
 'urdu' is a Turkish language meaning 'the market that used to run from one place to another along with the imperial army'
 vahaan jo mili-juli bhashaa boli jaati thi usko urduwalon kii bhashaa kehete the, kramash: vahi bhashaa swayan urdu kahi jane lagi
 The use of the word in this sense dates back to the end of the 17th century
 urdu kii praanrabhik rup yaa to sufi fakiron kii bani main miltaa he yaa janata kii bolchaal main
 From the point of view of language, the influence of Punjabi appears first in the development of Urdu, because in the 15th and 16th centuries, it was used in the 15th and 16th centuries by the poets and writers of the South for Punjabi literary works
 17veen or 18veen shatabdi main brajabhasha kaa gaharaa prabhaav urdu par padaa or bade-bade vidvan kavita main "gwaliori bhashaa" ko adhik shuddh maanane lage, kintu usee yug main kuch vidwaanon or kaviyon ne urdu ko ek nayaa rup dene ke liye braj ke shabdon kaa bahishkaar kiya or farsi-arabi ke shabd badhaane lage
 Urdu was used in the south
 uttari bharat main use nichi shrenee kii bhashaa samajha gaya kyonki vah dilli kii bolchaal kii us bhashaa se bhinn thi jisamen farsi sahitya or samskruti kii jhalak thi
 This distinction may not be seen much in the colloquial language, but with special use of style and words in literature, this variation becomes very wide and grows into the form of many literary schools, such as "deccan School", "delhi School "," Lucknow School "," Bihar School "etc
 sach to yah he ki urdu bhashaa ke banane main jo sangharsh jari rahaa usamen irani or hindustani tatv ek duusare se takaraate rahe or dhire-dhire hindustani tatv irani tatv par vijay paata gaya
 It has been estimated that 85 percent of the words in the language which is called Urdu are those whose basis is some form of Hindi
 shesh 15 pratishat main farsi, arabi, turki or anya bhashaaon ke shabd sammilit hai jo saanskrithik kaarnon se musalmaan shaskaon ke jamaane main swaabhaavik rup se urdu main ghul-mil gaye the
 Currently, Urdu is the mother tongue of many people in many areas of Pakistan, in many parts of northern India, in Kashmir and Andhra Pradesh
 is baat kii ore sanket kiya ja chukaa he ki musalmaan bharatvarsh main aae to yahan ke jivan par unka prabhaav padaa or ve swayan yahan kii sthiti se prabhavit hue
 They learned the languages here and expressed their views in them
 sabase pehle lahore ke khwaja masaood saad salmaan kaa naam miltaa he jinhone hindi main apana kavyasangrah ekatra kiya jo durbhaagya se aaj praapt nahin hota
 At the same time, the names of many Sufi fakirs are found who were wandering in every corner of the country and propagating their views in public
 is baat kaa anumaan karnaa kathin nahin he ki us samay koi bani banaai bhashaa prachlit nahin rahi hogi isliye ve bolchaal kii bhashaa main farsi arabi ke shabd milakar kaam chalaate honge
 Many examples of this are found in books written in relation to Sufis
 jin logon ko kavitaayen athwa vaakya mili hai unamem se kuch ke naam ye hai : baba farid shakarganj, sheikh hamidauddin nagauri, sheikh sharafuddin abu ali qalandar, amir khusro, makhdoom ashraf jahangir, sheikh abdulahaq, saiyad gesu daraz, saiyad mohammad jonpuri, sheikh bahaudin bajan ityadi
 Among them, Bachchan and Daurara suggest that a language was being created that could understand the masses and whose form was different from other dialects
 upar ke kaviyon main amari khusro or gesu daraaj urdu sahitya ke praarambhik itihaas main bahut mahatv rakhte hai
 Khusro's Hindi compositions, some of which are called Urdu due to being in Delhi's Khadiboli, have also been published in Devanagari, but the writings and poems of Gesu Daraz are still in search
 is samay tak "chakkinam", "tilavatul vajood", "merajanama" praapt ho chuki hai, in sab main sufi vichaar prakat kiye gaye hai
 Gesu Daraz was a resident of Delhi but spent much of his time in the south, where he died and that is why his language is called Dakkini Urdu
 sach yah he ki urdu, jisane dilli ke aasapaas ek bhashaa kaa rup grahan kiya tha, senaaon, sufi fakiron, sarkari karmchaariyon or vyapaariyon ke saath desh ke anya bhaagon main pahaunchi or uchit vaataavaran paakar badi or faili
 The signs of early development of the literary form of Urdu first appear in South and Gujarat
 gesu daraaj ke atirikt miranji shamsul ushshaq, burhanuddin jaanam, nizami, firoz, mahmud, aminuddin aalaa ne aisi rachanaayen chodi hai jo prayek urdu sahitya ke itihaas main sthaan praapt kar sakati hai
 After the fall of the Bahmani kingdom, when five states were formed in the south, Urdu got more opportunity to progress
 janata se sampark rakhane ke liye baadshahon ne bhi urdu ko hi mukhya sthaan diya
 Literature and art skills flourished in Golconda and Bijapur
 dilli se naata todane or apni swadhinata prakat karne ke liye unhone farsi ke viruddh is deshi bhashaa ko apanaaya or sahityakaron kaa saahas badhaayaa
 Ibrahim Adilshah of Bijapur presented his famous work "naurus" towards the end of the 16th century
 isamen braj or khadiboli kaa mail he, farsi arabi ke shabd bhi bich-bich main aa jate hai
 But its entire structure is the only Hindustani
 iske samast geet bhartiya sangeet ke aadhaar par likhe gaye hai
 Its role was written by the famous Persian scholar, "zahuri" in Persian, which is still known as "sehanasra"
 bijapur ke anya duusare badshaah bhi swayan kavi or kaviyon ke sangrakshak the
 Among these, the names of "atishi", "mukimi", "amin", "rusatami", "khushnud", "daulatshah" are memorable
 bijapur ke antim dinon main urdu kaa kahan kavi "nusrati" paidaa hua jisane shringaar or viraras main shreshth kavitaayen likhin
 Like Bijapur, even in Golconda, the king and the public were writing mostly in Urdu
 mohammad quli qutubashah swayan urdu, farsi or telegu main kavitaayen likhata or kaviyon ko protsaahan detaa tha
 His poetry collection provides a bizarre description of the seasons, fruits, flowers, birds and festivals of India
 uske baad jo or badshaah hue ve bhi achche kavi hue or unke sangrah bhi vidyaman hai
 Among the famous poets and writers, "vajahi", "ghoovasi", "ibne Nishati", "ghulamali" etc
 are important
 is prakaar dakshin main urdu ke is pehle saahitiyik rup ne kuch aisi rachanaaon ko janm diya jo sahitya or chintan donon kii drushti se saraahneey hai
 Among these compositions, Kuliyat Qaliqutbashah, Qutub Mushtari, Falban, saiful-mulook and Badiul Jamal, Manohar Madhumalati, Chandrabadan and Mehyar etc
 are counted among the best works of Urdu
 17veen shatabdi kii samaapti ke purv gujarat, arkat, mysore or madras tak pahunch chuki thi
 In Gujarat, it flourished mostly in the hands of Sufi poets, among whom the writings of Sheikh Bazan, shahaloju and Khub Muhammad Chishti are of great importance
 kyonki urdu kii paramparaayen ban chuki thim or lagbhag 300 varshon main unka sanghathan bhi ho chukaa tha isliye jab san 1687 i
 main mughalon ne dakshin ko apane rajya main mila liya tab bhi urdu sahitya ke sote nahin sookhe balki kavyrachana ne or teevr gati se unnati kii
 Poets such as "wali" Dakkini, "bahri", "vajahi", "wali", "velori," Seraj "," Dawood "and" Uzalat "originated in the late 17th and early 18th centuries
 inamen bhi "vali", "dakkini", "baheri", "seraj" kii gananaa urdu ke bahut bade kaviyon main hoti he
 "wali" can be called the link between northern and southern India
 yah spasht he ki dilli kii bolchaal kii bhashaa urdu thi parantu farsi ke prabhaav se vahaan ke padhe-likhe log apni saanskrithik aavashyaktaayen farsi se hi puri karte the
 They thought that Urdu cannot be fulfilled
 "vali" or unki kavita ke uttari bharat main pahunchne se yah bhram dur ho gaya or sahasaa uttari bharat kii saahitiyik sthiti main ek krantikari parivartan ho gaya
 Within a short time, Delhi echoed with the speech of hundreds of Urdu poets
 ab urdu ke dilli skool kaa aarambh hota he
 It is worth remembering that this was the era of the decline of the feudal period
 mughal raaj keval andar se hi durbal nahin tha varan baahar se bhi usapar akraman hote rahete the
 The public speaking language took advantage of this situation
 agar rajya prabal hota to na nadir shah dilli ko luutata or na farsi kii jagah janata kii bhashaa mukhya bhashaa kaa swaroop dhaaran karti
 Among the poets of this time, Khare Arzu, Abaru, Hatim, Yakarang, Nazi, Mazmoon, Tabaan, Fugan, "mazhar Jaanejaan", "fayez" etc
 hold very high place in Urdu literature
 dakshin main prabandh kaavyon or marasiyon kii unnati hui thi, dilli main ghazal kaa bolbalaa hua
 The progressive language here was more capable than the southern language to reveal the subtle feelings of the heart, so the progress of Ghazal seems natural
 yah baat bhi yaad rakhane yogya he ki is samay kii kavitaaon main shringaar ras or bhakthi ke vichaaron ko pramukh sthaan mila he
 The flood of hundreds of years old society had stopped and there was no new goal in front of life, so there is no strength and generosity in the poetry of this time
 18veen shatabdi ke samaapt hone se pehle ek ore nai-nai raajnneetik shaktiyaan sir uthaa raheen thi jisase mughal rajya nirbal hota ja rahaa tha, duusari ore vah sabhyataa apni paramparaon kii rogi sundarataa kii antim bahaar dikhaa rahi thi
 a situation was arising in Delhi for Urdu poetry and literature that it reached the court
 mughal badshaah shahalam swayan kavita likhte the or kaviyon ko aashray dete the
 The poets who raised the head of Urdu literature in this era are Mir Dard, Mirza Mohammad Rafi Sauda, mir Takhi "mir" and "mir Soz"
 inke vichaaron kii gaharaai or oonchaai, bhashaa kii sundarataa tathaa kalatmak nipunata prayek drushti se saraahni he
 "dard" expanded the boundaries of Urdu poetry into poetry areas of Sufi thought, "mir" into Ghazal and "sauda" with other genres
 parantu din bahut bure aa gaye the
 The pressure of the East India Company was increasing and the throne of Delhi was turbulent
 vivash hokar shah alam ne apane ko company kii raksha main de diya or pension lekar dilli chhod prayag main bandiyon kii bhanti jivan bitaane lage
 As a result, many poets and artists moved to other places
 is samay kuch nae nae rajdurbar sthapit ho gaye the, jaise hyderabad, avadh, azimabad, farrukhabad ityadi
 His new light and twinkling attracted many poets
 sabase adhik aakarshak avadh kaa rajdurbar siddh hua, jahaan ke nawab apane darbar kii chamak damak mughal darbar kii chamak-damak se mila dena chaahate the
 As Delhi's condition worsened, "fugaan", "sauda", "mir", "hasan" and after some time Musahfi, Insha, Jur'at and other poets reached Awadh and there became a new center of poetry which was called "lucknow School"
 It is said
 san 1775 i
 main lakhanu avadh kii rajdhani bana
 From that time onwards, persian-arabic education started in a big way and under the influence of Awadhi new sweetness was born in Urdu
 kyonki yahan ke nawab shiya musalmaan the or vah shiya dharm kii unnati or shobhaa chaahate the, isliye yahan ko kavyrachana main kuch nai pravritiyaan paidaa ho gai jo lakhanu kii kavita ko dilli kii kavita se alag karti hai
 The history of Urdu literature has remained a much more interesting subject than Delhi and Lucknow schools; But the truth is that there was not much difference between Delhi and Lucknow within the declining boundaries of the Sammati era
 yah avashya he ki lakhanu main bhashaa or jivan ke bahya rup par adhik jor diya jaataa tha or dilli main bhaavon par
 But in fact, it was Delhi's literary traditions that took this form in the changed situation of Lucknow
 yahan ke kaviyon main "mir", "mir hasan", "sauda", "insha", "musahafi", "jubit", ke pashchaat aatish, nasikh, "anos", "dabeer", "vazeer", "naseem", "rashk", "rind ore "sabaa" unchaa sthaan rakhte hai
 In Lucknow, there was an opportunity for the elevation of Mercia and Masnavi in particular
 lakhanu or dilli skulon ke baahar bhi sahitya rachana ho rahi thi or ye rachanaayen rajdarbaron ke prabhaav ke dur hone ke kaaran jansadharan ke bhaavon ke nikat thim
 The most important name in this regard is that of Nazir Akbarabadi
 unhone roodhiwaadee vichaaron se naata todakar hindustani janata ke dilon kii dhadakanen apni kavitaaon main band kin
 Both his style and ideology find the simplicity and generosity of Indian life
 pashchimi sampark ke falswaroop 19veen shatabdi ke madhya main bharatvarsh kii duusari bhashaaon kii tarah urdu main bhi nai chetana kaa anrabh ho gaya or aarthik, saamaajik, tathaa raajnneetik parivartanon ke kaaran nai vichaardhaara kaa udbhav hua
 But before that, the eroding feudal civilization of Delhi gave birth to poets like Zouk, Momin, Ghalib, "sheffata" and "zafar"
 inamen vishesh rup se gaalib kii saahitiyik rachanaayen us jivan kii shaktiyon or trutiyon donon kii pratik hai
 His importance is that in his poems he has coordinated both the heartfelt sentiments and the mental conditions in a quirky style
 urdu gadhy kaa vikaas nae yug se pehle hi ho chukaa tha parantu uski unnati 19veen shatabdi main hui
 In addition to "merajual Aashiquin" and "sabaras", some religious works are found in the south
 uttari bharat main "tahseen" kii "nau taraze murassa" kaa naam liya ja saktaa he
 The British established the Fort William College for their convenience and wrote some books in prose, which led to the development of a new genre of Urdu prose which became fully prevalent after 50 years
 yahan kii rachanaaon main mir amman kii "baboobahar" hydari kii "araishe mehafil", afsos kii "baage urdu" vila ko "vetaal pachisi", jawan kii "singhaasana battisi", nihalchand kii "mazahabe ishq", ucch koti kii rachanaayen hai
 In the early 19th century, "insha" wrote "the Story of Queen Ketki" and "dariya Latafat"
 lakhanu main sabase mahatvapurn or kathasahitya main suvikhyath pustak "fisaane ajaayab" 1824 i
 main likhi gai; iske lekhak rajab ali beg "surur" hai
 New curricula were being created due to the expansion of English education
 iske liye 1842 i
 main dehali kalege main "varnacular" transleshan socity" kii sthapana hui jahaan ramayana, mahabharat, leelavati, dharamshastra ityadi ke atirikt vibhinn vishyon kii lagbhag 150 pustakon ke urdu anuwaad hue
 In this way, Urdu prose also progressed and was able to support the new consciousness
 urdu sahitya main navjagriti ke vaastavik chihn 1857 ke vidroh ke baad hi se milte hai
 Its historical, political and social reasons are obvious
 in kaarnon se jo nai chetana utpann hui usee ne nae kaviyon or sahityakaron ko nai sthiti ke anukool likhane kaa avasar diya
 The first name can be taken from Sir Syed
 unheen ke netritv main haali, azaad nazir ahamed or shibali ne urdu gadhy or padya main mahaan rachanaayen kin or angrej sahitya se prerana lekar apane sahitya ko samay ke anukool banaaya
 Maulana Muhammad Hussain Azad was the creator of the new Urdu poem
 ve dilli kalege main apane vidhyaarthee jivan main europea vidwaanon or sahitya se prabhavit ho chuke the
 In Lahore, he founded "anjumne Punjab" in collaboration with the officials of the Education Department and while lecturing at one of its meetings in 1867 AD, he pointed out the errors of Urdu poetry and said that poetry is all parts of human life and nature
 It should be highlighted which unfortunately could not happen in Urdu poetry yet
 hamen ab puraani lakeer peetane ke bajaae nae vaataavaran kii samasyaon ko chintan or kavy kaa vishay bananaa chahie
 These ideas resulted in the creation of new poetry in Urdu poetry and most of the later great poets were influenced by it
 bahut se chhapekhane khul gaye the, patr-patrikas nikal rahi thim, nae puraane kaa sangharsh chal rahaa tha, isliye in logon ko apane nae vichaar prakat karne or unhen failaane main badi suvidha hui
 In the same era, the names of "sarshar", "sharr" and Mirza Ruswa can also be taken, which made a valuable increase in novel literature
 is yug ko har prakaar se aalochana kaa yug kaha ja saktaa he; jo kuch likhaa ja rahaa tha usko itihaas apni kasuti par parakh rahaa tha
 Whatever these great writers have written in the form of criticism, essays, novels, biographies, poems is the basis of today's new literature
 is yug kii mahanata yah he ki sahityakar hi navchetana ke agradoot or netaa ban gaye the
 Politically, these people were not revolutionary, but inspired the authors of their ideology
 20veen sadi kaa aarambh hone se bahut pehle rashtriyata kii bhaavana paidaa ho chuki thi or uski jhalak in sahityakaron kii kritiyon main bhi mil jaati he; parantu iskaa puraa vikaas "iqbaal", "chakbast", "premchand", ityadi kii kavitaaon or lekhon main hua
 It should also be remembered that along with this, the old traditions of literature were also going on and "amir", "dag", "jalal" and other poets were also enchanting the readers with their ghazals
 kisi na kisi rup main yah dhara ab tak chali ja rahi he
 Notable poets of this century include "safi", Durga Sahai "surur", "saqib", "mahashar", "aziz", "rawaan," Hasrat "," Fani "," Jigar "," Asar "and Hassan among the authors Nizami, Rashidul Khairi, Solomon Nadvi, Abdulhaq, Rashid Ahmed, Masood Hasan, Maulana Azad and Abidhusen
 varmman kaal main sahitya kii seemayen or vistrut hui hai or har vichaar ke lekhak apane-apane dhang se urdu sahitya ko duusare saahitiyon ke baraabar laane main lage hue hai
 Names of "josh", "firaq", "faiz", "majaz", "hafeez", "sagar", "mulla", "ravish", "sardar", "jamil" and "azad" are notable among the poets, So in prose Krishnachandra "ashk", Husseini, "minto", Hayatullah, Ismat, Ahmed Nadeem, Khwaja Ahmed Abbas hold their own importance
 20veen shatabdi main aalochana sahitya kii badi unnati hui
 In this, Niyaz, Firaq, Zor, Kalim, Majnu, Surur, Ehtesham Hussain, Ejaz Hussain, Mumtaz Hussain, Ibadat etc
 wrote many valuable books
 20veen shatabdi main saahitiyik skulon ke jhagade samaapt hokar vichaardhaaraon ke aadhaar par sahityarachana hone lagi thi
 The influence of English literature and education gave a boost to cinematic poetry
 phir prajatantr or rashtriyata kii bhaavana ne pragatisheel andolan ko janm diya jo 1936 i
 se aarambh hokar kisi na kisi rup main ab tak chal rahaa he
 In the meantime, "marx" and "freud" also divided the authors into different groups
 kuch lekhak mukt chand main bhi kavitaayen likhane lage, kintu is prakaar ke samast prayog abhi tak apni jaden bahut gahari nahin kar sake hai
 The new poetry in contemporary Urdu literature is being greatly influenced by experimentalism, candidism, symbolism and absolutism
 nai kavita jivan ke sabhi mulyon kaa bahishkaar karti he kyonki nae kavi saamaajik chetana ko kavyrachana main baadhak maanate hai
 Apart from this, new poets consider it necessary to break all the rules of language, thought, art and literature to prove their personality
 kuch log isi ko vichaar swatantraaa kaa naam bhi dete hai, kintu yah baat abhi tak spasht nahin ho saki ki nai kavita likhanewaale ek ore to sahitya or kala kii sabhi paramparaon se apana naata tod rahe hai or duusari ore ve apni vichaardhaara ko europe or america ke kuch darshanikon, lekhakon or kaviyon kii vichaardhaara se milaane kii anathak cheshtaa kar rahe hai
 This modernity is also influencing Urdu story and novel
 nai kavita, kahani or upanyaas ko sahitya ke itihaas main kya sthaan milegaa, is samay is sambandh main kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The contact process is the present-day method of manufacturing Gandhakamal
 yah ucch sandrata vaale amla ke nirmaan main upyogi he
 Platinum is used as a catalyst in this reaction

dl = ui kavy main ek prakaar kaa arth dosha Definition: According to Acharya Mammatt, the main element of poetry is defect, the teacher
 Acharya Vishwanath Prasad has described the defect in the literature as saying "rasapakarshaka Dosh:"
 It is not logical to do
 70 faults are mentioned in poetic light, they are usually divided into five faults: - 1-verse defect 2- Verse verse 3- Sentence defect
 4- Earth Dosh 5- Ras Dosh bhartiya kavyashastra main acharya abhinavgupt ke shishy kshemendra ne apni kriti "auchityavichaarcharcha" main rassiddh kavy kaa jivit yaa atmabhoot auchity tatv ko ghoshit kar ek nae siddhant kii sthapana kii thi, jo auchitywad ke naam se prasiddh he
 The seeds of this genesis of Kshemendra are also available in the Natyashastra of Maharishi Bharata, who has talked about the proper imitation of the costumes in the play
 baad main auchity shabd kaa prayog na karte hue bhi bhamah, udbhat or dandi is tatv kii satta prakarantar se maanate jaan padate hai
 Rudrat even makes a clear use of the word "justification"
 kintu auchity ko vishesh mahatv diya dhvanikaar aanandavardhan ne
 According to him, the main reason for logistics is lack of justification
 atah kavi ko kavy main auchity kaa sadaa dhyaan rakhana hoga
 Poetry will not be miraculous unless the plan of ornamentation and virtue is appropriate
 is baat ko hi kshemendra ne apni kriti main spasht ghoshit karte hue kaha tha, "auchity ke bina na alankaar hi ruchi paidaa karte hai, na gun hi
 "vyakottikshakritakant Kuntaka also considered one of the two cardinal virtues of poetry as a justification, the other being good luck
 vastut: auchity kuch nahin, kavi ke mul bhav ke anuroop gun, alankaar, reeti, shabdashayya, chhandrachana, vibhavadi kii yojana aadi kaa samuchit vinyas he
 Justification theory is thus an established provenance keeping in mind the totality of poetry
 kaha bhi jaataa he ki dhwani, ras, kavyarthanumiti, gun, alankaar, reeti tathaa vakrokti sabhi vastut: auchity kaa hi anudhaavan karte hai
 Both the story and the craft should be mutually identical, in the same way, it is necessary for the poet to take care of the rationale in the different elements of poetry
 kshemendra ne is tatv ko kavy kii aatma ghoshit kar iske 27 bhed maane hai - It is clear from this table that the justification principle is an established review method taking into account both the outward and the intimate of poetry

 loha dharti ke garbh main swatantra avasthaa main nahin paaya jaataa he, balki yah oxigen or sulfur ke saath yogic avasthaa main paaya jaataa he
 Originally iron has two ores - hematite and pyrite
 hematite se louhe ko nishkarshan kiya jaataa he, jisase oxigen alag ho jaataa he
 Separating iron from iron ore is called iron extraction
 louhe ke nishkarshan main carbon kii upasthiti main lohe ko galaaya jaataa he
 This action is called smelting
 shuru-shuru main kam galnaank vaale dhaatuon kaa pragalan kiya jaataa tha
 The melting point of copper is 1000 ° C, while the tin melts at 250 ° C
 cast aayran kaa galnaank 1370 degree celsius he
 The oxidation rate increases rapidly after 800 ° C
 yahi kaaran he ki pragalan kii kriya nimna-oxigen vaale vaataavaran main karaayi jaati he
 Unlike copper and tin, carbon dissolves easily in iron
 is tarah se lohe main carbon ke mishran se ispaat banaaya jaataa he
 In order to obtain more and more metals from the ore, the refractory material, carbon, is added in abundance
 carbon baad main icchit maatra tak oxikaran kii kriya dwaara nikaal diya jaataa he
 With this, the other elements, which are degraded and which are oxidative, get oxidized
 yahaan dhyaan dene vaali baat ye he ki lohe main carbon ke thod se her-pher se ispaat kii gunvattta main bada badlaav aa jaataa he
 Other substances are also added to the mixture of iron and carbon to make desired changes in the properties of steel
 ispaat kii tanyata badhaane ke liye isamen nickel or mangneej milaaye jate hai
 Chromium and vanadium are mixed to increase hardness
 dhaatukarmik vyavhaar main "vishuddh dhaatu" shabd kaa upyog aise vyapaarik mail kii dhaatu ke liye bhi hota he jisamen pradhanat: ve hi gun hote hai jo shuddh rasinic dhaatu main hote hai
 The impurities remaining in them are either difficult to remove, or are added deliberately to get any special properties in the metal
 is prakaar milaae janevaale tatwon ko 'mishradhatukari tatv' kehete hai
 Two methods of steel production were prevalent in ancient times
 bharat kaa prasiddh 'vuts' ispaat inhen vidhiyon se banaaya jaataa tha
 In carbidation method, the cast iron is heated to a high temperature for sufficient time by placing it in contact with coke
 jin paatro main yah kriya kii jaati he unhen parivartan paatr kehete hai or ye pathar kii silon ke bane hote hai
 These characters are made of carburetic furnaces
 paatr ke andar vaayu kaa pravesh na ho iske liye inhen acchhee tarah se agnisah padaarthon se band kar diya jaataa he anyathaa vaayu ke prabhaav se koyala jalakar raakh ban jayega or lohe kaa oxikaran hone lagegaa
 The eligibility should cover 1,000 ° c in 48 hours
 Is heated to is taap ko saat se lekar nau dinon tak sthir banaae rakhte hai
 As a result of this action, the carbon of coal gets entered into iron
 jab carbon paryaapt gaharaai tak pahunch jaataa he tab paatro ko ek saptaah kii avadhi tak dhire dhire sheethal kiya jaataa he
 In this way, the blisters appear on the surface of the rods
 isliye inhen 'fafoledaar ispaat' kehete hai
 This steel is heated and beaten to make it homogeneous
 carbadhishoshan ispaat kii pitayee karne ke baad bhi isamen newnaadhik asamta rahati he
 This steel is liquefied in clocks and its chemical composition is reduced
 is kriya ke dwaara carbadhishoshan ispaat main vidyaman dhaatumal ke kanon se bhi mukti mil jaati he
 For this purpose, mostly 50 lb
 of graphite watches are used
 in ghadiyon main carbadhishoshan ispaat ko rakhkar inhen coke bhatthiyon main garam kiya jaataa he
 The watch method does not have the sophistication of the metal, so the appropriate charge for this should be as pure as possible
 pehle isi vidhi ke dwaara ucch koti kaa aujaari ispaat taiyaar hota tha
 The real revolution in steelmaking came in the last days of the 1850s
 besamar vidhi pratham safal vidhi thi jisase badi maatra main ispaat utpaadan kiya ja saktaa tha
 After this came the open stove method
 aadhunik ispatnirmaan ko do bhaagon main baant sakate hai - praathmik tathaa dwitiyak ispatnirmaan 
 Primary steel making is called that in which new iron released from Vatya furnace is mostly used for steel-making
 dwitiyak ispatnirmaan use kehete hai jisamen ispaat nirmaan ke liye bhangaar yaa kabad ispaat kaa upyog ho
 The gases released during steel making can be used as a source of energy
 san 1856 main henry besimar ne ispaat utpaadan kii vidhiyon main krantikari parivartan kiya
 In this method, called 'bessemer Variant' in breakfast, air is flown through the blower in liquefied cast iron
 dravit lohe main vidyaman apdravyon kaa oxikaran vaayu ke oxigen dwaara hota he
 These actions are exothermic, so this method does not require external fuel
 lohe main vidyaman apdravya oxikrut hokar dhaatumal banaate hai or bachaa hua loha ispaat kaa rup dhaaran kar letaa he
 The outer part of the Bessemer converter is made of steel plate and lining of thermodynamic materials are given inside
 besimar vidhi ke antargat do paddatiyaan prachlit hai : amleey tathaa samaakshareey 
 The application of these methods depends on the properties of the cast iron
 yadi kachche lohe main phosphorus kii maatra adhik hoti he to samaakshareey vidhi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Acidic methods are used where phosphorus neutralization is not required
 besimar parivartitra ke andar die janevaale ooshmasah padaartho ke astr upyog main laai janevaali paddati par nirbhar karte hai
 In the acidic system, most silicic materials are used, whereas in the coaxial system only coaxial materials, such as dolomite, are used
 besimar parivartitra ke nital main hawa tontiyaan lagi hoti hai, jinke dwaara dravit lohe main ucch daav par vaayu dhaunkani se pravaahit kii jaati he
 The high pressure is necessary so that during the blasting period, the fluid does not flow through the iron spout into the air of the transformer
 amleey paddati main mukhya apdravya silicon, manganeez tathaa carbon hote hai
 Their oxidation takes about 12 minutes
 pehle silicon tathaa meganese kaa oxikaran hota he or ve dhaatumal banaate hai
 Then carbon is oxidized to form carbon monoxide gas, which ignites at the mouth of the changer and produces a huge flame
 is kriya ke baad parivartitra paatr ko namith karke taiyaar ispaat ko darvi main nikaal liya jaataa he
 Then steel is made of the desired chemical composition by adding carburetic and deoxidizing into it again as needed
 samaakshareey paddati main sabhi kriyaayein amleey paddati kii tarah hi hoti hai, parantu usamen phosphorus ke oxikaran ke liye 5-6 minute kaa atirikt samay lagata he
 Phosphorus is oxidized only after gradual oxidation of silicon, manganese, and carbon and combines with the existing lime in the vessel to form coaxial sludge
 is dhaatumal ko alag karne ke pashchaat hi dhaatu main pun: carburikarak tathaa vioxikaarak daale jate hai
 It is also called 'basic Oxygen Method'
 san 1851 main austria ke linj tathaa donavitz dhaatuvigyon ne besimar vidhi ke samparivartit rup kii khoj kii, jise unke naam par el
 di
 vidhi kaha gaya
 In this, pure oxygen is flushed over the surface of liquefied iron in the transformer vessel
 is vidhi se apdravyon kaa sheeghra oxikaran hokar nitrogen rahit ispaat kii prapti hoti he
 Today, about 75 percent of the world's steel production is done through open-cut furnace method
 is kaary ke liye khuli bhatthi kaa upyog hota he
 Like the Bessemer method, it also has acidic and coaxial transformations
 in paddatiyon kaa upyog kachche maal ke rasinic sanghatan par nirbhar karata he
 It is necessary to remember here that in the steel production method of open cuticle furnace, the quality of steel depends on the texture of the clinker
 isliye is vidhi main dhaatumal kii taiyaari par hi vishesh dhyaan diya jaataa he
 If coaxial sludge is required to be prepared, the 'coaxial Khulli Chulli kiln method' is used and if acidic sewage is required the 'acidic method' is used
 khuli chullibhatthee 25 se 300 ton dharita tak hi hoti he
 Chulital is 15 feet wide, 40 feet long and 20 inches deep in large brethren
 chullital kaa nirmaan vibhinn ooshmasah padaarthon se hota he
 Acidic heat is used in acidic system and coaxial thermodynamic materials are used in coaxial method
 bhrashtra kii diwaar tath chat saadhaarant: silica iton kii bani hui hoti hai
 Nowadays magnesite bricks are also being used for roofing
 chullital ke neeche donon ore ooshmasah iton ke rodhakon se nirmit do do kaksh hote hai, jinhen 'punarjanitr' kehete hai
 Outgoing combustion products from the nation pass through both regenerators on one side and thus provide their known heat insulators
 kuch samay pashchaat bhatthi main dahan yogya gas tathaa vaayu in tapt rodhakon ke dwaara bheji jaati hai, jisase ye rodhakon se ooshmaa praapt karti hai or tab dahan-utpaada duusari ore ke punarjanitron se hokar gujarata he
 This action is repeated at a difference of 15–20 minutes
 is pranali ke dwaara bhatthi main idhan tathaa dahan ke liye aavashyak vaayu chullital ke donon ore nirmit do alag alag margon dwaara bheji jaati he
 These routes are called ports
 badi bhatthiyon main prabhaar ko bharne ke liye saamanyat: paanch prabhaar dwaar hote hai
 There are 'spout holes' in the back walls of the furnace for the release of liquefied metal and sewage
 in bhatthiyon ko tapt karne ke liye gasiy athwa taral idhan kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Khuli Chulli furnace uses iron, scrap material or a mixture of both as raw materials for steel production
 bhatthi ke prabhaar ke pashchaat prabhaar ko dravit hone diya jaataa he
 Cheeks are used for the sophistication of metal, among which stone and iron ore are prominent
 loh ayask ke oxigen ke sampark se kramik rup se silicon, manganeez tathaa phosphorus jaise apdravyon kaa oxikaran hota he or ve dhaatumal banaate hai
 Thereafter, there is oxidation of iron carbon, which reaches its peak during the time of lime bubbling
 jab dhaatu kaa rasinic sanghatan aichhik vindu par pahunch jaataa he tab use darvi main nikaal liya jaataa he
 There again, carburetic and deoxidizer can be added
 is ispaat ko pind ke rup main sanchit kar lete hai
 Often the coaxial open cuticle furnace method is used along with the acidic Bensheimer method
 ise duple vidhi kehete hai
 When acidic Bessemer and coaxial and acidic open poultry furnace methods are used, it is called sacral or triplex method
 ispaat utpaadan main mukhyat: do prakaar kii vidyut bhatthiyon prayukt hoti hai : In the arc furnace, graphite is formed between the electrodes, or electrodes, and metals, which emit brisk heat and ignite the metal
 preran bhatthi main dhaatu prerit vidyuddhara ke pravaah ko avaruddh karti he, jisase ooshmaa utpann hoti he
 The arc furnace is more useful for steel production in large quantities and has capacities ranging from one ton to 100 tons
 preran bhatthi mukhyat: aujaari athwa vishesh prakaar ke ispaton ke utpaadan main kaam aati he
 In the arc furnace, the metal melts by creating an arc between the electrodes and the metal
 galan ke pashchaat parishkar kriya aarambh hoti he, jo bahut kuch prabhaar ke upar nirbhar karti he
 If most of the waste is in charge, then only deoxygenation is required and then carbonisation etc
 can be done in the tailor
 preran bhatthi main mukhyat: galan kriya hi kii jaati he or vahaan kisi prakaar kaa parishkaran sambhav nahin he

 There is no global public institution that controls the frequencies used for RFID
 siddhant rup main, har desh iske liye apane niyam set kar saktaa he
 The main bodies governing frequency allocation for RFID are: lo-frequency tag or hai-frequency tag bina ek license ke vishwa str par prayog kiya ja saktaa
 Ultra high-frequency tags cannot be used worldwide as there is no global standard
 uttari america main, UHF ko 902-928& mhz ke liye bina license ke istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, par pareshan adhikaar ke liye pratibandh maujuud hai
 In Europe, RFID and other low-capacity electrical radio applications are regulated by ETSI recommendations EN 300 220 and EN 302 208 and ERO 70 03, which allow RFID to operate with some complex band restrictions of 865–868 mhz
 Huh

 North American UHF standards are not accepted in France because they interfere with its military band
 china or japan ke liye, UHF kaa upyog karne ke liye koi niyam nahin he
 a site license is required for every UHF application in these countries, which must be applied to local authorities and can be canceled
 australia or newjiland ke liye 918-926 megahertj gaiyr-license vaale hai, lekin sancharan adhikaar ke liye pratibandh maujuud hai
 These frequencies are known as ISM bands

 Some of the standards created in relation to RFID technology include: EPC Gen2 epcglobal UHF Class 1 Generation 2 ke liye chota rup he
 epcglobal is working on an international standard for the use of mostly passive rfids and epcs in identifying multiple items in the supply chain for companies worldwide
 epcglobal ke abhiyaanon main se ek tha 1990 ke dashak main RFID duniya main prachlit protocol ke kolahal ko saral karnaa
 Two tag air interfaces were defined prior to 2003 by epcglobal
 in protocol kaa, jinhen saamanytah class 0 tathaa class 1 ke rup main janaa jaataa he, 2002-2005 main mahatvapurn vyavsaayik karyanvayan hua
 In 2004 the Hardware Action Group created a new protocol, the Class 1 Generation 2 interface, which solved many problems that were experienced with Class 0 and Class 1
 EPC Gen2 maanak, disambar 2004 main manjuur hua tha or sambhaavna he ki yah aage badhate niskriy RFID tag maanakon kaa aadhaar banegaa
 It was approved following a dispute with Intermec that this standard could infringe many of their rfid-related patents
 yah faisla kiya gaya ki sirf maanak se unke patent kaa ulanghan nahin ho rahaa he, balki yah ki yadi tag ko ek vishesh tareeke se padhanaa he to ho saktaa he ki Intermec ko kuch roylty kaa bhugtan karnaa hoga
 The EPC Gen2 standard was adopted as ISO 18000-6C in 2006 with minor modifications
 Gen2 EPC inlez kii sabase kam laagat smartchode dwaara 100 million yaa adhik ke khand main prayek tukade ke liye $0

 Nevertheless, the upcoming conversion and design of the existing Gen 2 protocol standard, from the inlays in the useful RFID label and the overall final cost will increase, especially with the expansion of additional security measures for RFID supply chain object-level tagging
 yahaan duniya bhar UHF Gen2 viniman par adhyatan kii full list he
 The list has been updated in January 2009

 The frequencies used for RFID in the United States are currently inconsistent with frequencies in Europe or Japan
 iske alaava, ubharta hua koi maanak abhi tak barcode ke samaan vyapak nahin ban paaya he
 a primary concern regarding RFID security is the illegal tracking of RFID tags
 tag, jo vaishvik rup se pathneey hai, ve nijee sthaan gopneeyata or korporate / sainya suraksha, donon ke liye khatra paidaa kar rahe hai
 Such concerns have been raised by the US Department of Defense recently adopting the RFID tag for supply chain management
 aam taur par, gopneeyata sanghathanon ne electronic utpaada code RFID tag ko upabhokta utpaadon main sannihit karne ke chal rahe prayaason ke sandarbh main chintaa vyakt kii he
 Depending on the design, epcglobal Network is also vulnerable to dos attacks
 EPC data anurodhon ko hal karne main DNS ke saath aisi hi pranali kaa upyog main, ONS root sarwar Dos hamale ke liye asurakshit ho jate hai
 Any organization planning to get started with epcglobal Network will be stifled upon knowing that the infrastructure of epcglobal Network has the same security vulnerabilities as DNS
 raksha kii ek dwitiya shrenee, tag chloning ko rokane ke liye kryptography kaa upyog karti he
 Some tags use a type of "rolling code" scheme, in which tag identifier information is changed after each scan, thus reducing the usefulness of observed responses
 adhik parishkrut upkaran chunauti-pratikriya pramanikaran main sanlagn hote hai jahaan tag, reader ke saath soochna kaa aadan pradaan karata he
 In these protocols, secret tag information is not sent over the unprotected communication channel between the tag and the reader
 balki, reader tag ke liye ek chunauti jari karata he, jo ek parinaam ke saath jawaab detaa he jisaki gananaa kuch gupt mulya ke saath bandhe kryptographic circuit kaa upyog karte hue kii jaati he
 Such protocols may be based on symmetric or public key cryptography

 This cost / power binding prompted some manufacturers to place encrypted tags using significantly weaker or proprietary encryption schemes, which do not necessarily prevent a sophisticated attack
 udhaaharan ke liye, exon-mobil speedpas, texas instruments dwaara nirmit ek kutalekh-sakasham tag kaa upyog karata he, jise digital signechar transponder kehete hai, jisamen kam laagat ke liye ek chunauti-pratikriya protocol karne ke liye ek kamjor, swaamitv ancripshan yojana shaamil he
 Still other encrypted protocols are attempting to gain confidentiality against unauthorized readers, although these protocols are still in the research phase

 There are conflicting views about whether aluminum can prevent the reading of the RFID chip
 kuch logon kaa daawa he ki aluminium parirakshan, jo multah ek farade pinjre kaa nirmaan karata he, bilkul kaam karata he
 Others claim that just wrapping an RFID card in aluminum foil only hinders further transmission, so it is not effective at stopping it altogether
 parirakshan, phir ek prayukt kii ja rahi frequency kaa kaary he
 Low frequencies lowfid tags, such as those used in implantable devices for humans and pets, are relatively resistant to shielding, although thick metal foil will prevent most reading

 UHF ultra-highfid tags are difficult to read when they are placed within a few millimeters of a metal surface, although their reading range actually increases when they are placed 2–4 cm from a metal and is the reason for the tag

 The use of RFID technology has led to much controversy and even product boycott by consumer privacy advocates
 CASPIAN kii sah-sansthaapak catherine albract or liz macintair is praudyogiki kii do pramukh aalochak hai jo RFID tag kaa ullekh "spichips" ke rup main karti hai
 There are two main privacy concerns related to RFID: adhikansh chintaaen is tathy ke aasapaas mandaraati hai ki utpaadon par chipke RFID tag utpaada ke khride jane or ghar le jane ke baad bhi sakriy rahete hai or is prakaar inkaa istamaal nigaraanee or aapurti shrinkhalaa suchi kaaryon se asambandhit prayojanon ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 The concerns raised by the above can be partially overcome by the use of clipped tags
 clip tag, ek RFID tag he jise upabhokta gopneeyata ko badhaane ke liye dizine kiya gaya he
 The clipped tag has been suggested by IBM researchers, Paul Moskowitz and Guenter Karjoth
 bikri ke baad, upabhokta tag ke ek hisse ko ukhaad saktaa he
 This allows the conversion of a long-range tag to a closer tag that can still be read, but only at shorter distances - less than a few inches or a centimeter

 This tag can later be used for return, snooze, or recycling
 baharhaal, pathan seemaa, reader or tag, donon kaa hi ek kaary he
 Improvements in technology can increase the reading range of tags
 reader ke tag ke bahut paas hone se kam duuri ke tag pathneey ho jate hai
 Typically, the reading range of a tag is limited to the distance from the reader at which the tag can draw enough energy from the reader area to control the tag
 ek reader kii shakti ko badhaakar, tag ko unke liye niyat duuri se adhik dur se padhaa ja saktaa he
 The limit on the reading distance then becomes the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal sent back from the tag to the reader

 Magadhi is the name of the Prakrit that was prevalent in Magadha region in ancient times

 According to Jain proceeds, Teerthakara Mahavira's preaching was in this language or the same version of Ardhamagadhi Prakrit
 pali tripitak main bhi bhagavan buddha ke upadeshon kii bhashaa ko magadhi kaha gaya he
 According to Prakrit grammars, Magadhi Prakrit had three special characteristics - samraat ashok kii poorviy pradeshwarti kaalsi or jogarh kii dharmalipiyon main purvokt teen lakshanon main se pratham or tritiy ye do lakshan prachurtaa se paae jate hai, kintu doosraa nahin
 In Zenagams, the third trend is found in plurality, and the first trend is in small quantities; The second trend is not even here
 isi kaaran vidwaan ashok kii purv pradeshiy lipiyon kii bhashaa ko jain aagmon ke samaan ardhamagadhi maanane ke paksh main hai
 In some ancient writings, such as in the article of Jogimara Cave of the Ragadha mountain range, the above three trends of Magadhi are found sufficiently
 kintu jis pali tripitak main bhagwaan buddha ke upadeshon kii bhashaa ko magadhi kaha gaya he, un granthon main swayan kuch apwaadon ko chhodkar magadhi ke ukt teen lakshanon main se koi bhi nahin miltaa
 That is why scholars have an inclination to consider the basic language of Pali texts as Magardi rather than as Magadhi
