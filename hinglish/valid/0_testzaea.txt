 International disputes can also be settled in three other ways- aapasi samjhaute se; With the help of a third person; And madhyasthata dwaara
 The middle decision had special significance in the mutual relations of the ancient Greek city states

 In the Middle Ages we also find examples of arbitration

 In 1794 AD, there was a treaty between the United States and Great Britain, which is known as the j Treaty

 Between 1794 and 1913, more than two hundred tribunals took place, of which the 1872 Alabama tribunal is notable
 prarambh main vivachan pakshon kii ichha par nirbhar karata tha
 In a disputed case, arbitration was based on a covenant voluntarily made by different parties
 baad main yah prayaas hua ki vivachan anivaary kar diya jaae or pasandida is prakaar kaa ho jiske antargat vibhinn paksh bhavishya main hone vaale vivaadon kaa nipataara vivachan dwaara karaane ke liye baadhya hon
 At the same time, there was an effort to remove many of the earlier individual treaties and take a comprehensive collective treaty that would take the place of all individual treaties

 The purpose of the Convention of 1899 AD was that all international disputes should be settled in a friendly manner and for this purpose a permanent institution of arbitration court should be established which is accessible to all

 In 1907 AD, the first convention was reconsidered and the number of paragraphs increased from 61 to 96
 kintu anivaary vivachan kii yojana asafal rahi or pratham mahayuddh ne is yojana kaa ant kar diya
 Nevertheless, the tradition of arbitration by individual treaties developed and from 1902 to 1932 AD, the Hague Arbitration Court gave twenty tribunals
 rashtrasang ke abhismay main aisa koi niyam nahin tha jisase sadsy rajya anivaary vivachan ke liye baadhya hon
 The establishment of the International Court of Justice paved the way for the possibility of compulsory jurisdiction but in actual practice arbitration was not its purpose

 In 1929, there was a collective treaty of the states of America through which a system of total American arbitration was arranged
 iske atirikt vivachan kii sanstha vyaktigat sandhiyon par hi aadhaarit rahi
 Initially, the head of another foreign state was often elected arbitrator
 niyamanusaar rajya pramukh ko yah adhikaar tha ki vah vivachan kaary anya kisi ke supurd kar de
 The result was that the arbitration work was done by the state officials and the decision in arbitration began to take the form of arbitration in the color of politics rather than on the basis of legal basis
 atev prakriya ke is rup kaa ant ho gaya
 In the present system a tribunal is made in which the number of thinkers chosen by each party is equal
 vivachakagan mukhya vivachak kaa nirvachan karte hai
 The tribunal's action is headed by the Chief Arbitrator
 mukhya vivachak ke nirvachan main yadi vivaachakon main matbhed ho jaataa he to nirvachan kii karrwai vishesh niyamon ke anusaar hoti he
 There is often a difficulty in the election of arbitrators, especially the chief arbiter, due to which the direction of arbitration is delayed and sometimes it is not possible
 is kathinaayee ko dur karne ke liye san 1899 i
 main sthaayee vivachan nyaayalay kii sthapana hui
 This Court is really a list of only those persons who are eligible for arbitration and agree to it

 When any two states direct for the arbitration of a dispute, then the terms and conditions of the direction are fixed by a treaty letter or other similar paper
 yadi sandhipatr main kisi niyam yaa siddhant kaa ullekh nahin hota to vivachan kii karrwai vyavhaar-vidhi-niyamon ke anusaar hoti he
 In 1899, many process rules were made, but they are used only when the necessary rules are not written in the treaty
 is prakaar prakriya sambandhi sabhi baaten pakshon dwaara swayan nishchit kii ja sakati hai
 The arbitration process is divided into two parts - written procedure and oral action; parkraman kii karrwai niyamit rup se gupt rakhi jaati he; The Tribunal has the power to decide questions regarding personal capacity; nyaayaadhikaran ke vimarsh gopneey hote hai; The decision is by majority vote; panchat kaa uddeshypurna hona aavashyak he; The arbitral award is final, but only the parties to the dispute are bound by it
 madhyasth nyaayaadhikaran ke nirnay praaia kanoon ke prati sammaan kii bhaavana se prerit nahin hote jis prakaar nyaayalay ke nirnay hote hai
 Arbitral tribunals are often affected by the desire to satisfy the parties, not by the provenance of following the actual legal rules
 nyaayaadhikaran ke nirnay main praaia un yuktiyon kaa ullekh nahin hota jin par unke nirnay aadhaarit hote hai or na ve apane ko purvavarti drushtaant maanane ke liye baadhya samajhate hai
 Arbitration when the tribunal violates the authority limit given in the direction or acts directly contrary to justice or it is proved that such arbitration is obtained by deceit, fraud or corruption or that the award of the arbitration is unclear The decision is considered flawed and various parties are not obligated to give its recognition in that direction
