 asperanto ek aasaan or kritrim antarrashtriya bhashaa he
 The first book of Esperanto was published in Warsaw in 1887 by Ludwig Lazar Zamenhof, the creator of this language, nicknamed "doktoro Esperanto"
 unki chahat thi ki esparanto ek vaishvik bhashaa bane
 The word "esperanto" in this language means "to have hope"
 yah bhashaa europe kii pramukh bhashaaon ke madad se banaai gai thi
 Its script is also based on sound principles
 lipi jaise padhi jaati he, bhashaa kaa vaise hi uccharan hota he
 Esperanto is a collective, organized, simple language for speakers of different mother tongues
 zamenhof kaa uddeshy tha kii ek aisi bhashaa ho jo seekhney main aasaan ho, rajnatik drushti se tatasth ho, jo rashtriyata ke paar ho or bhinn-bhinn prantiy or rashtriya bhashaaon ke bolne waalon ke bich shanti or antarrashtriya sanchaar kaa saadhan ban sake
 It is said that today, between 1 lakh and 20 lakh people in the world can speak Esperanto
 is bhashaa ko bolne waalon kii sabase badi sankhya europe, purvi asia or dakshin amrika main he
 The first World Esperanto Conference was held in France in 1905
 uske baad, donon mahayudhon ko chhodkar, har varsh alag-alag deshon main vishwa sammelan hote aa rahe hai
 Esperanto is used to learn other languages
 anek varshon se antarrashtriya bhashaa kaa prashn raajnneetigyon, vaigyanikon or bhashashastriyon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kar rahaa he
 International words for scientific measurement are being used worldwide
 antarrashtriya vyavhaar ke paribhaashik shabd bahut badi sankhya main gadhe ja rahe hai or manyata praapt kar rahe hai
 Linguists are seriously considering the subject that an international language will be created by making a few grammar-approved rules

 According to statistics from 20 years ago, by that time more than 4,000 original and translated books had been published in Esperanto language and more than 100 monthly papers were published regularly

 This new form of Esperanto was named Edo
 antarrashtriya bhashaa ke rup main asperanto se pratispardhaa karanevaali aaj or bhi anek bhashaaen kshetra main hai
 Currently, the tools of learning Esperanto are not available in Hindi
 hindi bolne vaale kisi or bhashaa ke dwaara hi asperanto sikh sakate hai -- angrezi or anya videshi bhashaaon ke dwaara to asperanto internet par bhi sikhi ja sakati he
 Take a look at these pages: and
 1) anterrashtriya: asperanto sabase zyaada kaam tab aati he jab alag-alag matra bhashaayen bolne vaale log milte hai
 Today there are millions of Esperanto speakers worldwide
 2) samanta: jab aap asperanto bolte hai, to aap apane aap ko sabake samaan mahasoos karaten hai kyonki jinase aap bol rahe hai unhone bhi aap hi kii tarah asperanto seekhney kaa prayaas kiya he
 3) Neutral: Esperanto is not a denomination of any one race or country
 isliye yah ek tatasth bhashaa ke rup main kaam karti he
 4) Simplicity: Esperanto is designed in such a way that learning this language is much easier than other languages
 vyakaran par ek tippanee: 5) Jeevan Bhasha: Like other languages, Esperanto has also developed and all our thoughts and feelings can be expressed in this language
 internet par asperanto sahitya ke kayi namoonay hai or par asperanto samskruti ke bare main do shabd
 In Esperanto words are taken from many languages
 asperanto ke varnmaala main 28 akshar hai
 Some put caps on letters
 asperanto bhashaa main Q, W, X, y akshar nahin hai
 The pronunciation of each letter is definite
 
 For this reason, Esperanto does not have the hassle of spelling like other European languages
 ye bhashaa jaisi boli jaati he waisi hi likhi jaati he
 For example, Mi lernas Esperanton is pronounced m lernas esperanton
 iskaa arth he " main asperanto sikhta hoon " yaa "main asperanto sikh rahaa hoon"
esperanto estas pli facila ol la angla kaa uccharan asperanto astas pli fatsila ol laa angla he
 It means, "esperanto is easier than English

 The emergence of the Greek alphabet centuries after the fall of the Mycenaean civilization and after the disuse of the earlier Greek writing system, the Linear b script, in the eighth century BC
 Happened in the middle of rekhiy bi kaa udbhav rekhiy e se hua jo ki minoai sabhyataa dwaara viksit thi, jinaki bhashaa unani se sambandhit nahin thi, parinamswaroop minoai aksharmala unani bhashaa kii dhvaniyon ke lipyantaran hetu adarsh madhyam uplabdh nahin karaatin
 The Greek alphabet prevailing today developed after the Greek dark period, that is, the decline of the Mycenaean civilization and the rise of ancient Greece, which was about 800 BC
 It was the time between the epics of Homer and the beginning of the ancient Olympic Games in 776 BC
 dhvanyatmak phonishian varnmaala ke ek anukalan ke rup main, iskaa sabase ullekhneey parivartan, swar aksharon kaa samaveshan he, jiske bina unani apthaneey hoti
 Vowel signs were not originally used in the Semitic alphabet
 purvavarti pashchimi simitic lipi parivaar main, ek avishisht swar ke saath vyanjan hetu ek akshar hameshaa prayukt kiya gaya
 This did not reduce readability as the word in semitic languages is based on triaxial roots that explain meaning only by the presence of consonants and vowels are clarified by context
 vipareet, unani ek bhaaropee bhashaa he atah swar main antar arth main bada antar paidaa karata he
 Therefore, the Greek alphabet divided the letters into two categories - vowels and consonants, where a consonant must be used with a vowel to become an accentable unit

 In Eastern Greek, which lacked complete pronunciation, the semitic glottal consonant / ħ / ka h) was also used for long vowels / ɛː / and finally Ω) The letter began to be used for long / ɔː / 
 The reason for the inclusion of long open letters e and o lies in oral morphological study of the language
 paramparaagat greek main nishchayatmak evam sambhaavnarthak aksharon main spasht bhed tha jo ki ‘ε ) vs

 Greek also included three new consonant letters Φ), Χ) and Ψ) which are given at the end of the alphabet according to their development

 Geetgovind is a poetic composition of Jayadeva
 gitgovind main shrikrishna kii gopikaon ke saath raasalila, raadhavishaad varnan, krishna ke liye vyakulata, upalambh vachan, krishna kii radha ke liye uthkanthaa, radha kii sakhi dwaara radha ke virah santaap kaa varnan he
 Jayadev was born in Odisha in a village called Kendubilva near Bhubaneswar
 ve bengal ke senvansh ke antim naresh lakshmanasen ke ashrith mahakavi the
 The date of 1116 AD on an inscription of Lakshmanasen, therefore Jayadeva must have composed Geetgovind at this time
 ‘shri gitgovind’ sahitya jagat main ek anupam kriti he
 Its captivating composition style, sentimentality, melodious raga-ragini, religious immediacy and melodious gentle-ear-footsteps provide a rare joy to literary Ras Pipasu
 atah dow e bi kith ne apane ‘sanskrit sahitya ke itihaas’ main ise ‘apratim kavy’ mana he
 In the book 'on the Musical Modes of the Hindus' written by William Jones in 1784, Geetgovind has been considered as 'pastoral Drama' ie 'gopanatya'
 uske baad san 1837 main french vidvan edwin arnold tarsan ne ise ‘lirical drama’ yaa ‘geetinaty’ kaha he
 In Van Schroder's 'travel Management' and Pishal Levi's 'melo Drama', in Encyclopaedia Britannica, Geetgovind has been called 'dharmanataka'
 isi tarah anek vidwaanon ne apane-apane dhang se iske sambandh main vichaar vyakt kiya he
 The German poet Goethe praised Geetgovind in the same way as Abhigyanasakuntalam and Meghdootam
 gitgovind kavy main jayadev ne jagadish kaa hi jagannatha, dashavathari, hari, murari, madhuriphu, keshav, madhav, krishna ityadi naamon se ullekh kiya he
 It is a complete book containing 24 arrangements and 72 verses, in which the union and reunion of Radha and Krishna are bound by gentle and graceful positions
 kintu nagari prachaarini sabha dwaara prakashit ‘hastlikhit sanskrit granth suchi, bhaag-i’ main gitgovind kaa 13vaan sarg bhi uplabdh he
 But this mother seems to be archaic
 gitgovind vaishnav sampradaay main atyadhik aadrut he
 Hence, it has been adopted as a regular service in Sri Jagannath temple since the middle of the 13th century
 is geetikavy ke prayek prabandh main kavi ne kavifal swaroop sukhad, yashasvi, punyarup, mokshad aadi shabdon kaa prayog karke iske dharmik tathaa darshanik kavy hone kaa bhi parichay diya he
 Shringar Ras narrates the tradition of Jayadeva Kalidas
 gitgovind kaa raas varnan shrimadbhagwat ke varnan se samya rakhata he; tathaa shrimadbhagwat ke skandh 10, adhyay 40 main akrur stuti main jo dashavathar kaa varnan he, gitgovind ke pratham sarg ke stuti varnan se samya rakhata he
 Later, many 'anukriti' poems of Geetagovind were composed
 atah jayadev ne swayan 12wein sarg main likhaa he - This has been confirmed in Kumbhakarna Praneet 'rasikapriya' vaccine etc
 gitgovind kii lokapriyata or saushthav ke kaaran bharat kii prayek bhashaa main gadhy or padya main tathaa angreji, latin, french, german, arabi, farsi aadi bhashaaon main iskaa anuwaad kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, the translations, commentaries, commentaries and commentaries written in Sanskrit language are impossible to find in any other language
 kisi tikaakar ne iskaa shringaar pradhan kavy ke rup main varnan kiya he to kisi ne bhakthi sampradaay ko mahatva dekar ise bhakthi kavy mana; to kisi ne sangeet ko pradhanta dekar ise sangeet shaastra kaa rup diya he evam kisi-kisi tikaakar ne shabdamadhurya or saushthav ko lekar isaki shabd vyutpatyatmak vyakhya kii he
 Hence, Geetgovind is undoubtedly an all-inclusive independent text
 gitgovind ke pratham tikaakar udaynacharya ne ‘bhavavibhavini’ tikaa likhi he
 Udayanacharya, who lives on the banks of Prachi, very close to Jagannath Puri, was a dear friend and admirer of Jade Dev
 san 1170 se 1198 ke madhya main ‘bhavavibhavini’ tikaa likhi gayi thi, jisamen 100 shloke hai
 Its three maternal families are available in Udaipur and Nagpur
 ‘gitgovind’ kavy main baarah sarg hai, jinka choubees prabandhon main vibhaajan hua he
 These arrangements are subdivided into verses or songs
 prayek pad athwa geet main aath padya hai
 The speakers of the songs are Krishna, Radha or Radha's friend
 atyant nairashya or niravadhi-viyog ko chhodkar bhartiya prem ke shesh sabhi roopon - abhilaashaa, irshyaa, pratyaasha, niraashaa, coup, maan, punarmilan tathaa harshollas aadi—kaa badi tanmayata or kushalta ke saath varnan kiya gaya he
 The description of all these forms of love, apart from being very interesting, succulent and lively, is so beautiful that it seems as if the poet is translating it into poetry by giving the scripture, that is, the form of emotion to the mind, or the abstract into tangible form
 samodadamodar Akleshkeshv mugdh madhusudan Balsamic madhusudan sakanksh pundaricaksh Kunthbachunth nagarnarayan Billikalakshmipati mandamkund Clever quadrilateral sanand damodar Superlative gitgovind 12ve shatvdi main likhi gayi ek aisi kavy rachana he jo hame bhagwaan krishna or radharani ke prem ke bare main bataati he
 It has 12 chapters in total
 yah kavy odisha rajya ke bhubaneshwar or puri shahar ke madhyavarti kendubilva yaa kenduli shashan naam ke gaanv main vaas karne vaale brahman jayadev ki kriti he
 Jaidev, with the help of his wife Padmavati, made such a change that Tatkalin started to be the king of Utkal
 phir jab gitgovind ki praadhanya jagannatha ji ne swapn main raja ko bataayi tab se mandir ke devadasi raat ke ekaant seva or subah ki seva main prabhu jagannatha ke saamne odishi nrity rup main pesh karne lage
 Earlier scholars believed that Jayadeva is the councilor of the king of Bengal
 par shilaalekh evam pracheen mandir jo odisha main maujuud he, unase pramanit hua ki jayadev jagannatha ke bhakt the or utkal rajya ke vaasi the
 Even today, Geetgovind Sarvajanin is becoming beloved through Odissi dance
 odishi nrity hi jayadev kaa odisha praant k hona suchit karata he
 His Geetagovind poetry was propagated in Padoshi, Andhra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka
 phir uttarbharat main khaastaur par rajasthan main mirabai ke dwaara hua
 In Gurugranth Sahib, we also write the name of Bhagat Jayadev, who is the author of Geetgovind
 ‘gitgovind’ kavy kaa rachana-kaushal is prakaar sarvatha naveen evam nitant moulik he ki uske kavy-rup kaa nirnay karnaa hi dushkar ban gaya he
 Some Western scholars call it 'rustic-metaphor', while other reviewers call it 'gitanatak', in some others it is a 'sophisticated journey'
 pishelle is kavy ko ‘sangeet roopak’ sweekaar karte hai
 Levi considers this to be an intermediate or coordinated form of song and metaphor, but Jayadeva has divided his work into cantos and alluded to his conception of poetry as a place of drama
 yahaan yah ullekhneey he ki is kavy main naatak kii bhaanti ank, prastaavna aadi kuch bhi nahin he
 Some scholars also call it 'shringar Epic'
 krishnaswami ayangaar ne apane granth ‘a history of indian opera' main ‘gitgovind’ kavy ko sangeetnataka kaa ek purvarup mana he or uskaa vikaas evam utkrisht paripaak solahavin shatabdi ke shri tirthanarayan swami kii rachana ‘krishnalila tarangini’ main sweekaar kiya he
 In this regard, Acharya Baldev Upadhyay's premise is based on the assumption that the names of ragas and talas with the words of 'gitagovind' infer the fact that the poet's sight may have been towards the Mahotsavas prevalent in Bengal in those days
 , Which used songs with dance and music
 is aadhaar par is kavy ko ‘sangitaroopak’ bhi mana ja saktaa he
 Nature has a very important place in the depiction of human beauty
 is sandarbh main ‘gitgovind’ kavy main ruturaj vasant, chandra-jyotsna, surabhit samir tathaa yamuna tat ke mohak kunjon kaa bada hi sundar varnan dekhne ko miltaa he
 Even in this poetry, birds are visible to the bird singing the power of love and glory
 jayadev ne is kavy main vaidarbhi reeti—maadhurya vyanjak varnon vaali style—kaa prayog kiya he
 In poetry, long spans have been used at some places, but still there was no sense of obscurity
 vastutah kavi ne vishesh-vishesh utsavon par sarv-saadhaaran ke gane ke liye hi to geeton kii rachana kii thi
 Therefore, it was necessary to keep them comprehensible
 geeton main na keval asaadhaaran swaabhaaviktaa he, apitu unamem anupam maadhurya bhi he
 In praise of the composition style of 'gitagovind', macdonal says - "there is no resemblance of 'gitagovind' poetic style in the entire Sanskrit literature in beauty, in musical utterances and in the beauty of composition
 kavy ke adhyayan se spasht ho jaataa he ki kavi main kahin laghu padon kii vegavati dhara dwaara, to kahin chaaturya ke saath rachit deergh samaason kii laypurna gati dwaara apane pathakon-shrotaaon par yathesht prabhaav daalane kii adbhut kshamta he
 The poet Nana is unique not only in the use of verses, but also in bringing rhetoric between the middle and the end of the steps
 ’’ In 'geetgovind' poetry, Jayadev has adopted an all new and original style by not following the traditional composition system
 shloke, gadhy or geet ke mili-jule prayog dwaara kavy main anupam rachana-maadhurya kii sristi hui he
 The poet has used shlokas in descriptive contexts such as the visual planning or stage-specific depiction required for sustaining the narrative
 paatro kii manodasha ko suchit karne vaale sanvadatmak prasangon main gadhy kaa prayog hua he tathaa bhavanubhuti kii abhivyanjana padyon main kii gayi he
 Thus, in the innovative composition system adopted in 'geetgovind', the characters, dialogues and songs are interwoven in such a way that they feel a unique joy
 is anupam rachana-style ke aavishkarta jayadev, apane upmaan aap hi hai
 radha-krishna's racy portrayal of the Keli stories and his convergent pastimes make Geetagovind a captivating book of spiritual adornment
 radha-krishna ke pranay ke chithran main prem kii vividh dashaon—aashaa, niraashaa, utkantha, irshyaa, coup, maan, aakrosh, milanotsukata, sandesh-preshan tathaa milan aadi—kaa jaisaa abhibhoot karne vaala hridaygrahi chithran is kavy main hua he, vaisaa anyatra dhundhane par bhi kahin nahin miltaa
 Radha does not like or tolerate raas-vilas with Sri Krishna's gopis
 radha apni sakhi ke madhyam se shrikrishna ke prati apana aakroshamulak upalambh bhejti he, parantu us anany pranyini ko itane se santosh nahin hota, uskaa prem nirbhar-hriday use apane priyatam ke prati apane pragadh anuraag ko vyaktigat rup se prakat karne ko vivash kar detaa he
 On the arrival of Radha, Shri Krishna leaves Braj and the beauties and is oriented towards him
 radha kii sakhi shrikrishna se radha kii or radha se shrikrishna kii ek-duusare main gahan anurakti kaa tathaa ek-duusare se dur rahane par anubhav kii ja rahi virahajanya vednaa kaa maarmik varnan karti he
 She inspires the two to meet each other with her soft and gentle words
 chandroday hone par pranay-vyathaa se adheer bani radha apane uddipt anuraag par niyantran nahin rakh paati or uski abhivyakti ko vivash ho jaati he
 Radha expresses her anger and resentment towards him with utterances filled with utterances upon Shri Krishna's arrival
 idhar radha kii sakhi radha se maan ko chhodane kaa anurodh karti he udhar swayan shrikrishna radha ke rup-soundarya kii prashansa ke vyaaj se uski chatukaarita karte hue use manaane evam apane anukool banane kii cheshtaa karte hai
 Eventually Radha's values go away and she goes to kadamba-kunj to meet her Kant
 vahaan shrikrishna radha se pranay-yachana karte hue usase lajja-sankoch ko chhodane kaa anurodh tathaa rati-bhoga main sahyog dene kaa manuhaar karte hai
 Both of them indulge in a rishi play with a happy mind, and after this Radha asks Pranayasikthan utterances to make her adornment to her beloved Shri Krishna
 apni pranpriya ke anurodh ko gaurav dete hue shrikrishna saharsha apane haathon se radha kaa shringaar karte hai
 Some critics today accuse Jayadeva of making devotion to radha-krishna as an adornment, but this blasphemy on the poet worshiping the melody is not only unjust but his own indiscretion
 vastutah daampaty pranay main uplabdh tanmayata athwa talleenta ke charam utkarsh kii tathaa bhed main abhed kii kalpana ke chudant nidarshan kii abhivyakti hi bhakthi ke kshetra main maadhurya bhav kii sristi karti he

 On the basis of the continual vilas of radha-krishna depicted in this book, the Brahma Vyavarta Purana describes the beauty and actions of radha-krishna, but it is a harsh truth that the Puranakas neither describe 'geetagovind' poetry
 No one has been able to sustain dignity and decency, nor has the description been made as simple, interesting and heart-warming
 is kshetra main bhi jayadev apane upmaan aap hi hai
 It is on this basis that perhaps 'geetagovind' poetry in krishna-bhakti literature has the distinction of scripture
