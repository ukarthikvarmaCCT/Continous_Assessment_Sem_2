 Six middle-class ex-servicemen of the Treaty Army, Pulaski, Tennessee, founded the original Ku Klux Klan on 24 December 1865, soon after the American Civil War
 In the group's early years its original name led to speculations among news media and detractors, with theories ranging from Mexican mythology to a popular idea — which is still circulating — that the words "ku" and "clucks" in bolt-action rifles There were sound-imitative words for the sounds of firing and closing the bullet

 Former Brigadier General George Gordon of the Treaty Army developed a pre-script or Klan doctrine

 Gordon likely told former slave trader and former military general Nathan Bedford Forest about the Klan in Memphis, Tennessee
 The so-called Forrest replied, "this is a good thing; This is a very good thing
 ham uskaa prayog habshiyon ko unki jagah par rakhane ke liye kar sakate hai
 a few weeks later, Forrest was elected as the Klan's national leader, the Grand Wizard, however, he always denied his leadership
 1868 main, ek samachar-patr ko diye ek saakshaatkaar main, forest ne kaha ki mukhyatah claan kaa virodh loyal lig, republican rajya sarkaron, tennesi ke rajyapal brownlo jaise logon or anya qalinposhon or shararti logon se he

 In fact, apart from being overwhelmingly white, southern and Democratic, they all had in common the fact that they called themselves Klan-people
 itihaaskaar erik founar ne nirikshan kiya: In fact, the Klan was a military force working for the interests of the Democratic Party, the zamindar class and all those who wanted to restore white supremacy

 Political leaders killed during the campaign included Arkansas Congressman James M

 In January 1871, Republican Republican John Scott of Pennsylvania set up a committee of members of Congress, which recorded 52 witnesses to the atrocities of the Klan
 Those horrific witnesses were adjusted into 12 sections
 In February, former federal general and Massachusetts Congressman Benjamin Franklin Butler introduced the Ku Klux Klan Act

 Although Forrest claims that the Klan is a national organization of 550,000 people and that it can mobilize 40,000 Klan members, as a secret or "invisible" group, on five days' notice, it actually has no membership nomenclature, There were no chapters and no local authorities

 In 1869, Forrest ordered the disintegration of the Klan, stating that it was "being misguided by its original venerable and patriotic aims, becoming harmful to it rather than being a servant of public peace"
 Historian Stanley Horn writes, "generally speaking, the end of the Klan was more of an imperfect, slow, and gradual dissolution than a formal and decisive dissolution
 " georgia main ek patrkaar ne janvari 1980 main likhaa, "is maamle kaa sachcha bayaan yah nahin tha ki ku clucks licensadhari aparaadhiyon kaa ek sangathit samooh tha, balki yah tha ki jo log aparaadh karte the, ve swayan ko ku clucks kehete the

 In many states, officials were reluctant to use black civilian forces against members of the Klan because they feared it would increase racial tensions
 When the Republican governor of North Carolina, William Woods Holden, called the civilian army against the Klan in 1870, it increased his unpopularity

 The United States Supreme Court removed the Ku Klux Ordinance in 1876, ruling that the federal government could no longer punish individuals, although states would be forced to follow federal civil rights regulations
 The Republican government passed a second civil rights ordinance to provide equal access to public facilities and other housing systems without racial discrimination

 Although the Ku Klux Ordinance of 1871 destroyed the first Klan, southern whites established other, similar groups that kept blacks out of elections through threats and physical violence
 Rutherford B
 as President Reconstruction ended with the election of Hayes, who abolished the Confederate army's authority over the South; However, blacks still found themselves deprived of the basic civil rights that Republican lawmakers attempted to protect
 1882 main, sanyukt rajya banaam haris main sarvocch nyaayalay ne aadesh diya ki claan adhyadesh aanshik rup se asanvaidhanik tha

 In a later discussion with Griffith, Wilson confirmed his enthusiasm

 aam shairdharak ne jis company main nivesh kiya he uske laabh se dividend paata he
 If that company is shutting down due to any reason, first all the stakeholder such as government, employees, lenders, preferential shareholders are paid
 iske baad yadi rakam bachati he to aam shairdharak ko bhugtan kiya jaataa he
 It appears from the name of the preferred share that the preference shareholder is above the common shareholders in the company's priority list
 yani jab bhi dividend yaa company band hone kii dasha main bhugtan kii baat aati he to priference shairdharakon ko praathamikta di jaati he

 iskaa arth ye hua ki koi company jaruri rakam ugaahne ke liye kam share jari kar paaegi or saath hi uski dividend lauebility yaa labhaansh kii dendaree bhi usee ke hisaab se kam ho jaaegi
 For example, the cross value of shares of a company is Rs 50 but the company meets the profitability criterion of SEBI, so it can issue its shares at a price of Rs 75
 yani 25 rupee ke premium par jari kar sakati he
 It is worth noting here that the company declares its dividend or dividend over the share or face value, irrespective of the premium at which the shares are issued
 initial public ofer ke maamle main companiyaan nimna teen tareekon main se kisi ek tareeke kaa prayog karte hue share kaa mulya tay karti hai: That is, according to the fixed price method, the company decides the price at which the shares are offered
 ye kaam ishyu khulne se pehle hi kar liya jaataa he
 The company gets to know how much is the demand for shares only when the issue is closed
 is vidhi se shares premium par bhi suchit kiye ja sakate hai
 In this method, the net worth of the share offered to the investor is not estimated

 But in legal terms the shareholder is not a partial owner of that enterprise or factory
 udhyam anshadhariyon kii sampurna poonji se kuch bhinn vastu hai
 All the assets of the division are vested in the said well organized institution and not the persons who make it
 vidhaan kii drushti main anshadhariyon ke kuch adhikaron or nihit swaarthon ke saath saath kuch daayitv bhi hai
 The interest or interest of the shareholder is not just from movable property, but from the division itself

 ansh ke kuch daayitv bhi hai

 Unix had one drawback - it is difficult to understand and operate
 andrew tenenbam, aimusterdam main computer vigyaan ke professor hai
 He wrote a program called Minix to help it
 isamen bhi kuch kamiyaan thim
 Linus Torvald was a computer science student at the University of Helsinki, Finland
 unhone minix kii kami ko dur karne ke liye ek program likhaa jo ki baad main ‘linus kaa unics’ yaa chote main linaks kahalaaya
 His first core or Karnal was posted in Internet in 1991
 tab tak richard stallmen kaa 'gnu' project shuru ho chukaa tha
 Linus Torvald took many programs from this in his Linux
 isliye richard stallmen kaa kahana he
 That it should be called 'gnu-linux'
 par yah naam, shaayad lambaa rahane ke kaaran chal nahin paaya
 But this does not mean that the GNU project is not involved in the success of Linux
 gnew project ke bina linaks sambhav nahin tha
 The Unix operating system was conceived and implemented at AT & T's Bell Laboratories in the United States in 1969 by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas mcilroy and Joe Ossan
 unics pehali baar 1971 main relies hua, or puri tarah se assembly bhashaa main likhaa gaya tha, jaisaa ki us samay aam abhyaas tha
 Later, in a major pioneering approach in 1973, it was written by Dennis Ritchie in some programming language
 unics ke ucch stareey bhashaa karyanvayan kii uplabdhta ne vibhinn computer platformon ko apane porting ko aasaan bana diya
 Due to an antitrust case prior to entering the Computer Enterprise case, AT&T was required to license the operating system's source code to anyone
 natijatan, unics jaldi bad gaya or academik sansthaanon or vyavsaayon dwaara vyapak rup se apanaaya gaya
 In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs; Free of legal liability requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product, where users were not legally allowed to modify Unix
 richard stollman dwaara 1983 main shuru hui jienyu pariyojna kaa lakshya "purna unics-sangat software system" banane kaa lakshya tha jo puri tarah se muft software se bana tha
 Work began in 1984
 baad main, 1985 main, stallman ne free software foundation kii shuruyaat kii or 1989 main jienyu general public license likhaa
 By the early 1990s, many programs (text editors, Unix shells, and a windowing system) required in an operating system were complete, although device drivers, daemons, and kernels, called GNU / Herd, were low-level
 The elements were intercepted and incomplete
 linas torwaldas ne kaha he ki yadi us samay jienyu karnel uplabdh to, usne apana khud kaa likhane kaa faisla nahin kiya hoga

 ISO dwaara hi prakashit hai : takneekee report, takneekee vishesheekaran, saarvajanik uplabdh vishesheekaran, takneekee shuddhipatr, evam and pathpradarshak
 The international standard is interpreted as the ISO xxrep 5 n heading, where xxrep 5 n is the standard number, xxrep 4 y is the year of publication, and the heading indicates the subject
 If the standard is the result of the work of the Joint Technical Committee JTC1, then the IEC is also included

 The use of dates and iss is incompatible for incomplete or unpublished standards, and in some circumstances the title of a published work may also be omitted

 Their naming conventions are similar to the standards, only TR is applied instead of IS, before the report name
