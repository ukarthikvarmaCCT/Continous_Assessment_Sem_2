 * gautam dharmasutra main keval teen prashn hai
 There are nine chapters in the first and second questions and ten chapters in the third question
 is prakaar sampoorn gautam dharmasutra 28 adhyyon main vibhakt he, jisamen ek sahastra sutara he
 This book is only in prose and is the oldest among all the Dharmasutras
 is granth main vedon ke mantranshon ko sutara rup main uddhrut kiya gaya he
 Although the Yajurveda mantras are also cited in these sutras, the treatise of this text is believed to be related to the Samaveda, as it not only contains many themes of the Samaveda, but also instructs many of the Samaveda verses
 saath hi is granth ke tritiy prashn ke ashtum adhyay main anek sutara samaveda ke samavidhan brahman se uddhrut he
 Similarly, in the twelfth sutra of the first chapter of the third question paper, there are directions of nine mantras of Samaveda
 pratham prashn ke pratham adhyay ke sutara 52wein tathaa tritiy prashn ke saptam adhyay ke 8wein sutara main paanch mahavyahritiyon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 These vyavritis are also related to the Samaveda
 in pramaanon ke aadhaar par gautam dharmasutra kaa sambandh samaveda se spasht he
 m m Kane has considered the relationship of Gautam Dharmasutra to Gautam Kalpa, but at the same time he has also given the opinion of its independent composition
 * From time to time, there are also projections in the Gautam Dharmasutra
 aisa praayah anek granthon ke saath hua he
 Gautam Dharmasutra is also no exception to this
 pramaan rup main kaha ja saktaa he ki boudhayan dharmasutra main gautam ke naam se yah mat uddhrut kiya gaya he ki brahman ko kshatriya kii vritti sweekaar nahin kerani chahie
 * But this opinion is not available in the present Gautama Dharmasutra, but instead it has been said that the Brahmin can also adopt Kshatriya and Vaishya instincts in emergency
 * isi prakaar vasishtha dharmasutra main bhi gautam ke naam se yah vichaar vyakt kiya gaya he ki yadi koi aahitagni yatra main mar jaae to uske sapind ghaas–phoos ke putale kaa punardaah karen, kintu vartmaan gautam dharmasutra main aisa koi sutara nahin he
 Many verses are also available in the Gautama Dharmasutra and in many manuscripts, an entire episode was added on Karmavipaka, which is not explained by Hardadatta
 in pramaanon ke aadhaar par vidwaanon kii dharna he ki gautam dharmasutra main samay samay par anek parivartan hote rahe hai
 Kundalal Sharma ji is of the view: 'this type of recitation or projection was done before Kumaril because such discourses have been discussed in the' Tantra Vartika '*
 mitakshra, smritichandrika tathaa anya granthon main uddhrut is rachana ke anek sutara vartmaan sanskarnon main uplabdh nahin hai
 ' gautam dharmasutra kaa kaal isa purv 400–600 ke pehle mana jaataa he
 It is for this concept that Gautama is mentioned in many texts
 jisase swatah siddh he ki gautam dharmasutra unase purvavarti he
 Similarly, other literature is also mentioned in Gautama Dharmasutra
 atah is sutaragranth ko us sahitya se parvarti hi maananaa hoga
 The two sides are as follows: gautam dharmasutra main kisi bhi dharmasutrakaar ke naam kaa ullekh praapt nahin hota, apitu 'ityeke', 'ekasham', 'eke' aadi shabdon ke dwaara hi apane se purvavarti aacharyon kaa ullekh isamen kiya gaya he
 In the Gautama Dharmasutra * a vote is given by the name of Manu
 * gautam dharmasutra kii vyakhya karte samay muscari ne apni vyakhya kii pushti main anek udhaaharan manusmriti se die hai
 Researchers have discovered more than 500 similarities in the terms of Gautama Dharmasutra Matha Manusmriti, even then it does not prove that the present Manusmriti is the main source of Gautam Dharmasutra
 * gautam dharmasutra* main ‘lokvedavedangvit’ kahkar veda–vedang tathaa* main ‘vakovaketihaaspuranakushalh’ kahkar puraana aadi kii charchaa bhi kii he
 Also, Upanishads - Vedanta etc
 are also mentioned in Gautama Dharmasutra *
 * isi prakaar 2–2–28 main nirukt* kii ore bhi sanket hai
 * On the basis of these evidences, Gautama Dharmasutra appears to be the latter of these texts
 boudhayan dharmasutra main do baar gautam kaa ullekh hua he
 * The Srautasutra Latyayana of Samaveda * and Drahayana * also cite Gautama
 samavedic gobhilgriysutra* bhi gautam dharmasutra ko pramanik maanata he
 Gautama is quoted in the Vasistha Dharmasutra *
 gautam dharmasutra kaa 19waan adhyay hi vasishtha dharmasutra main 22wein adhyay ke rup main he
 In Manusmriti *, Gautama is called the son of Utthya and in yajnavalkya-smriti * Gautama is counted in the scriptures
 shankaracharya ne veydantasutra–bhashya* main gautam dharmasutra* ko uddhrut kiya he
 * On the basis of these evidences, Gautama Dharmasutra stops after these compositions
 dow jolly gautam dharmasutra ko aapstamb dharmasutra se shatabdiyon purv maanate hai
 * M
 m Kane is of the view that Panini had no grammar at the time of Gautama Dharmasutra and if he had, he could not establish his importance

 praayah sabhi dharmasutron kaa pratipaadya manushya ke vyaktigat tathaa saamaajik aachaar evam karttavya hai
 In Gautam Dharmasutra, a detailed discussion has been done regarding them
 anya dharmasutron ke samaan gautam dharmasutra main bhi mukhyatah varnon evam ashramon ke niyamon tathaa varnon ke dainik dharmakrityon kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he
 The Gautama Dharmasutra attaches utmost importance to the Varnashrama-system, even in it there is a prohibition of discourse with Varnashram, inferior and impure
 brahmacharee, grihasth, vaikhanas tathaa bhikshu ke rup main gautam ne manushya jivan ko chaar ashramon main vibhakt karke chaaron ashramavaasiyon ke karttavyon ke vistaar se ullekh kiya he
 Gautama gives importance to Grihastrashram, because all ashrams are dependent on it
 anya ashramon ke angrat bhikshu naam se sanyasashram ko gautam mahatvapurn maanate hai
 Vanaprastha or Vaikhanas is the link between householder and sannyasa
 gautam ne un sabhi ashramon ke karttavyadi ke vishay main vistaar se vichaar kiya he
 Gautam has given great importance to hospitality under the Ashram system
 gautam dharmasutra* ke anusaar sanyasi ko bhi atithi seva kerani chahie tathaa grihasth ko ‘devpitrumanushyarshipujak’ hona chahie
 Helping the grieving, patient, poor and student is the ultimate religion of the householder
 use atithi, balak, rogi, stri, vridhon, sevakon ko bhojan dekar swayan bhojan karnaa chahie
 Gautama has ordained five Mahayagya for the adherence to household religion
 * iske saath hi is dharm kii shuddhta ke liye anek niyam bhi banaae hai
 In the context of ashram-dharma, the Gautam Dharmasutra emphasizes on human qualities like mercy, forgiveness, exclamation
 in gunon ke saath daan dene kaa vidhaan bhi yahan par kiya gaya he, kintu gautam dharmasutra* ke anusaar daan paatr kii yogyata ke anusaar dena chahie
 Gautama has a lot of emphasis on Satyabhashna and true conduct
 sabhi ke liye yah anivaary he
 That is why true speech has been called great penance
 satya bolne se swarg tathaa asaty bhaashan se narak prapti kii baat bhi kahi gai he
 With these qualities, a man should be non-violent, soft, tolerant, forgiving
 is prakaar gautam dharmasutra main vyaktigat tathaa saamaajik jivan ko shreshth banane kaa praytn kiya gaya he
 Along with this, Gautam also knows that a person due to his natural weakness tends to Kupath
 kabhi–kabhi puure samaaj main hi aniatikta vyaapt ho jaati he, kintu yadi ytn kiya jaae to ye durbalataayen der ho sakati hai
 Therefore, in the form of punishment in Gautam Dharmasutra many types of atonement have been constituted by which a person can be purified and lead a better life again
 is granth main kahin kahin maance–bhakshan kaa ullekh bhi miltaa he, kintu vah prakshipt prathit hota he
 In the Gautam Dharmasutra, adequate light has also been thrown on the Varna-system along with the Ashram-system
 is prasang main brahman ko sarvopari sthaan pradaan kiya gaya he
 The duties and rights of the four varnas as Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra are well discussed here
 varna–vyavastha ke sucharu sanchalanarth yahan par savarna vivaah ko hi manyata pradaan kii gai he
 If someone marries asvarna, then his children will be called varnaskar
 yahan par yah bhi kaha gaya he ki nirantar saat pidiyon tak chalane vaali varnsankar santaan bhi apane apane kaaryon ke aadhaar par utkrisht varna yaa nishkrut varna kii ho jaati he
 Atonement, crime, punishment, death and birth annulment are also determined according to the varna
 sambhavtah brahman ko uski vidwata tathaa shreshth aacharan ke kaaran hi bandhanon se mukt rakhaa gaya hoga
 Therefore, in the Gautama Dharmasutra * it is said to be 'tadaktakstvadatti' gautam dharmasutra main shudron kii sthiti acchhee nahin dikhaai detii he
 Religious rites are not prescribed for them and only home labor is prescribed for them
 shudra kaa yahi dharm batalaaya gaya he ki vah ucch varna ke logon kii seva kare
 In Gautam Dharmasutra, the woman is given enough importance because she is the mother of children
 use shreshth acharya kaha gaya he
 Although he occupies a prestigious position as housewife and co-religionist in house related and religious works, yet he is called as an independent in the matter of religion
 kanya kaa vivaah mata–pita ke adheen he kintu yadi ve samay par kanya kaa vivaah nahin karte, to vah swayan anukool yuvak se vivaah kar sakati he
 Religious religion is mandatory for a woman
 apane pati ke atirikt use kisi or ke vishay main sochna bhi nahin chahie
 The strictest punishment for unethical sexual relations has been enacted
 gautam dharmasutra main daasi ke rup main nari kaa nimna swaroop hi drushtigochar hota he
 In one sutra *, it has even been said that if a maid is kept hostage with a man, he can consume it
 is kathan kaa auchity gautam dharmasutra ke tikaakar hardutt ne yah kahkar batalaaya he ki paas rakhi upbhogya vastu par koi vyakti kab tak sanyam rakh saktaa he? hardutt kaa yah kathan naitikta kii seemaa kaa ulanghan karata he
 Whatever the reason, this situation is indicative of inferiority of society
 gautam dharmasutra main rajya–vyavastha par bhi prakaash daalaa gaya he
 According to Gautam *, it is the duty of the king to protect the pranamatra and keep the subjects in the right place by punishing them justly
 raja vidwaan tathaa sadaachari brahman kii sahaayta se rajkaarya karata he
 The king is not autocratic in the Dharmasutras
 uske nyaay kii prakriya bhi jan–tantrik he
 In the state, the Brahmin is the one who rules the religion and the king is going to follow it
 * is prakaar gautam dharmasutra main ek bahut hi samanvaypurna lok–vyavastha kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 An attempt has been made here to give the right direction to the society by determining the duties of almost all kinds of different sections of the society so that the society can progress and people should grow in love, justice, mercy, benevolence etc
 sankshep main kaha jaae to gautam ne apane dharmasutra ke madhyam se sampoorn samaaj ko hi naitik evam saamaajik drushti se niyantrit karne kaa praytn kiya he

 Then he resorts to the real CBI so that he can catch this fake CBI
 ranvir singh asli sibiai officer wasim se vaada karata he ki wo is nakli gut ko pakadaney main ji jaan laga degaa
 Meanwhile, Ajay and Sharma continue their raids by becoming fake CBI and are saved every time because those who fall in their house do not file a police complaint for fear that doing so will reveal the truth of their black money

 Creatures that do not have a spine are called invertebrates or invertebrates
 vigyaan kaa vah vibhaag aksheruki bhrunvigyaan kehalaata he jisamen aise praaniyon main bacchon ke janm ke aarambh par vichaar hota he
 Invertebrates are divided into 15–16 categories, however, their embryology proves that this division is only extraterrestrial and that there is an inherent correlation between beings, especially in embryos, through which evolution is confirmed
 praaniyon kii vibhannata unke vaataavaran or tadnusaar unki jeevanapaddati ke kaaran hoti he
 According to this theory, all beings can be divided into only two divisions
 ek to aadyamukhi or doosraa dwitiyamukhi
 Both these branches belong to the sacrum class
 isse yahi siddh hota he ki praaniyon ke vikaas main aadyamukhi pehle bane or uske pashchaat dwitiyamukhi
 All vertebrates evolved from the Second River
 adhiktar praaniyon main nar or maadaa pruthak hote hai
 Males produce sperm and females lay eggs
 in donon ke sanyog se baccha paidaa hota he
 But there are also many low-class animals in which males and females have no discernment and do not give sperm or eggs
 inaki vruddhi inke saare sharir ke dwivibhaajan, yaa ankuran, yaa bijaen nirmaan dwaara hoti he
 From these, two such beings are combined for a short time in some of the more advanced beings and thereafter increase the lineage by division again
 inase bhi adhik unnat praaniyon main dekha jaataa he ki do pruthak praani ek duusare se sampurna rup se sanyukt ho jate hai or unki pruthak satta nahin rah jaati
 After such a coincidence, there is then an increase of dynasty by division and rebuttal
 aise praani eckoshin shrenee ke hai jinka sara sharir keval ek hi kosh kaa bana hota he
 But there are also some who take the shape of sperm and eggs like high-grade animals, and after the combination of these two, rebuttal and division is practiced
 eckoshikeey ke sharir kii, ek hi kosh hone ke kaaran, vruddhi main keval kosh ke aaytan main vruddhi hoti he
 But in Naikkoshin beings, body growth is gradual
 is praarambhik vardhansheel avasthaa main ye bhrun kehalaate hai or purnataa praapt karne ke purv unamem bahut parivartan hota he
 The embryo also belongs to the same cell in its initial stage, although it is a conjunctiva of two different cells, the sperm and the egg, called the zygote
 yah yugmaj kramash: bhedan dwaara bahukoshi banataa he, parantu eckoshinon se isaki bhijhata isi main he ki vibhajit kosh puthak nahin ho jate
 The progress and formulation of these new shells takes place on two confronting methods
 kuch praaniyon main in nae koshon kaa bhavishya bahut hi praarambhik kaal main nirdhaarit ho jaataa he, jisase yah nishchit ho jaataa he ki ve kin kin angon kii sristi karenge
 This method is called special variation or kuttimachitra development
 aise ek vibhaajansheel andey ko do samaan bhaagon main vibhakt karne par prayek khand us praani kii keval ardhang hi bana saktaa he
 In the second method, the organs are not fixed in the first stage and by dividing such eggs into two parts, though they become smaller in volume, each part makes up the whole animal
 aisi vibhaajan pranali ko anishyit athwa viniamak bhedan kehete hai
 But after a period of time, the future of the shells in these is determined like the first method and at that time the animal does not become full when the eggs are split
 saadharantaya andon ke andar khadyapadaarth pitak ke rup main sanchit rahata he
 The growing fetus is confirmed by the pups
 andey ke bheetar pitak kaa vitaran mukhyat: teen prakaar kaa hota he
 In the first, the quantity of the Pitak is very small and it is equally spread in all the eggs
 aise andey ko apiti kehete hai
 In the second type, the quantity of the pupa is very high and it is collected in the lower part of the egg
 aise andey ko ekat:piti kehete hai
 In the third type, the pupil is situated in the central part of the egg
 aise andey ko cendrapati kehete hai
 According to the quantity and position of the egg, the egg is divided into different types
 pitak vibhaajan kriya main baadhak hota he
 The undigested eggs are completely differentiated
 aisi vibhaajan pranali ko purnabhedan kehete hai
 But due to aggregation of the lower part of the egg in the beaten eggs, the upper part of the egg remains pure and active and the division process remains tied only in the upper part
 neeche kaa bhaag praarambhik kaal main vibhajit nahin hota
 Such partial partitioning system is called incomplete penetration
 jahaan pitak andey ke centresthal main rahata he vahaan vibhaajan kriya keval paridhi par aavddh rahati he
 Such a partition system is called overdevelopment
 adhiktar andon main sakriy upree bhaag or apekshaakrit niskriy nimna bhaag pehle se hi pratyaksh ho jaataa he- upree bhaag ko praani dhruv kehete hai or neeche ke bhaag ko vegetative athwa wegital pole kehete hai
 The division of eggs varies according to different types of symmetries
 dwiparshv samamiti main pratham vibhaajan rekha kharbooze kii dhari kii tarah hoti he, jiske falswaroop do kosh banate hai
 These two shells create the south and left sides of the body
 donon parshwo main samaan rup se vibhaajan hota rahata he
 The characteristic of triangular symmetry is that the dividing lines always intersect each other with vertical lines and the cells grow uniformly around the axis
 iske atirikt ek teesri reeti bhi hoti he jisamen vibhaajan rekha vakr hoti he or kram se ek baar dahini ore ko or duusari baar bain ore ko jhuki rahati he
 Such a system is known as the Kuntal penetrations, but their end result is bilateral symmetry
 dvayar samamiti main pratham vibhaajan dwiparshv hota he, par iske pashchaat donon parshwo main trijya samamiti kii pratha prachlit hoti he
 The division takes place at a rapid pace - the number of cells increases, but they become smaller in volume
 ant main bahukoshwala ek golakaar bhrun banataa he jisko ekabhitika kaha jaataa he
 The new shells are all on the periphery of this sphere and in the middle there is a cavity filled with lymph
 is vivar ko ekabhiktika guha kehete hai
 Such a hollow monocular is called a cavity monocular
 isaki bahari diwaar main keval ek hi kosh kii gaharaai hoti he
 Due to the accumulation of the pituks downwards in the solitary eggs, the monocyte cavity is formed upwards
 vibhaajan keval andey ke upar hi, jahaan pitak kii maatra atyadhik hoti he
 Remains bound and the ecliptic cavity is formed in a very brief form
 is prakaar kii ekabhiktika ko bimbakabhiktika kehete hai
 In eggs in which the pupil lives medially, the division is only in the periphery
 aisi ekabhiktika ko paryacbhiktika kehete hai
 In some beings, the monotony is solid and the shells are filled even inside the circle
 aisi sthiti main ekabhiktika ko sandracbhiktika bhittika athva tuut kehete hai
 The mukhadwar is formed in the monocular position in the cavities, due to which such monocularity is called mukhakabhiktika
 anya shrenee ke praaniyon main aisa nahin hota
 The embryo is called as porous until one layer is made of two layers, respectively
 duusari part kai vibhijh paddatiyon se banati he
 The simplest system is in the apoptotic eggs
 isamen ekabhiktika kaa nimna bhaag, vardhdhriv, kramash: ekabhiktika guha ke andar pravesh karata he
 And finally the inner layer joins the outer layer
 ekabhiktika guha kaa astitv nahin rah jaataa or uske sthaan main ek doosraa vivar banataa he jo ab do parto se dhakaa rahata he
 This hole is open due to a hole in the bottom
 is chhidr ko aadyantrmukh kehete hai
 This system of becoming porous is called the practice of inwardness or emboli
 bahari part ko bahi:str or bhitari part ko ant:str kehete hai
 From the inner level, the digestive system of these animals and all the organs produced from it develop
 is kaaran ant:str se veshtit vivar ko aadyantr kehete hai
 In most unorthodox beings, the Adyantramukh is the director of their forearms and their mouth is formed at or near it
 aise praaniyon ko aadyamukhi kehete hai
 On the contrary, in all the angels and some non-destructive beings, there is a directive of the posterior part of the Adyantmukh creature where the anus is made
 aise vipareetapanthi praaniyon ko dwitiyamukhi kehete hai
 In the eggs in which the pupil is more plentiful and the unicellular cavity is very short, the uppermost cell divides at a rapid rate and propagates over the space of the lower caudate filled with increasing, respectively
 is tarah neeche kii ore do parte banati hai
 This system is called extrapolation
 bimbekabhiktika main pitak atyadhik hone ke kaaran nae kosh keval upree bhaag main banate hai or unamem se kuch kosh alag hokar pehali part ke neeche aa jate hai
 Such a system is called segregation
 iske atirikt kuch praaniyon main upree part prasaarit na hokar bheetar kii ore mud jaati he or sankshipt ekabhiktika guha ke neeche duusari part banaati he
 This practice is called intrusion
 bahukoshavishisht nimna shrenee ke praaniyon main, jaise chhidrin, aantarguhi ore kankativarg main keval do hi part banate hai
 For this reason, they are called double-headed
 inhen do parto se inkaa sara sharir or uske vibhinn ang banate hai
 In these, the feature is that the outer covering of the body and the inner digestive cord are attached to each other by only one cellless fiber, which is called medial
 in teen shrenee ke praaniyon ke atirikt bahukoshavishisht sabhi praaniyon main ek teesraa part banataa he jo bahi:str tathaa ad:str ke bich main sthit rahata he
 It is called Madhyastra, and such creatures are called Tristri
 is madhyastar kaa pravartan yaa to bahi:str tathaa ant:str donon sansthaaon se hota he, athwa keval ant:str se hota he
 In the first stage, this intermediate level is called extradimensional level and in the second stage it is called intermediate
 aisa dwijateey madhyastar keval aadyamukhi shrenee ke praaniyon main hota he
 Secondary beings have only the intermediary
 aprishthvanshi praaniyon main keval sharkrumivarg or shallyacharm dwitiyamukhi hote hai or shesh sab aadyamukhi hote hai
 The specialty of three-tier beings is that the middle layer forms a lymph fissure between the outer covering and the digestion, which is called dehguha
 is dehguha kii bahari or bhitari deevaaren madhyastar kii parton se hi dhaki hoti hai
 In addition, muscle, bone, blood, reproductive system and excretory organs are formed from the middle level
 kuch tristari jeev aise bhi hai jinamein dehguha nahin rahati or uske sthaan par ek vishesh tantu bharaa rahata he jise mooloti kehete hai
 For this reason, the tristari is then divided into two parts - one is Sadheguha, where the Dehguha is present and the other is Adehguha, in which only the origin remains in place of Dehguha

 Emperor Mihir Bhoja ruled for 49 years from 836 AD to 885 AD
 mihir bhoj ke samrajya kaa vistaar aaj ke multan se pashchim bengal tak or kashmir se karnataka tak phela hua tha
 He was an ardent devotee of the protector Emperor Shiva

 Baghdad historian al-masoodi, who came to India in 915 AD, has also written about the mighty army of 36 lakh soldiers of Mihir Bhoja in his book Maruzul Mahan
 inaki rajshahi kaa nishaan “varah” tha or muslim akramanakariyon ke man main itani bhay thi ki ve varah yani boar se nafrat karte the
 People of all classes and castes in Mihir Bhoja's army took up arms to fight the nation and fought the Islamic invaders
 samraat mihir bhoj ke mitra kabul kaa laliya shahi raja kashmir kaa utpal vanshi raja avanti varman tathaa nepal kaa raja raghavdev or assam ke raja the
 Emperor Mihir Bhoja at that time was the enemy, Palavanshi king Devpal, the nation of the south, Katu Maharaj Amodhavarsha and the Khalifa of Arabia, Matsim Sim Wasik, Mutvakkal, Muntashir, Mautamidadi
 arab ke khalipha ne imran bin musa ko sindh ke us ilaake par shaasha niyukt kiya tha
 Which had the right of the Arabs
 samraat mihir bhoj ne bengal ke raja devpal ke putr narayanalal ko yuddh main parrast karke uttari bengal ko apane samrajya main sammilit kar liya tha
 The king of the south defeated the king Amodhavarsha and merged his territory with his empire
 sindh ke arab shaasha imran bin musa ko puri tarah parajeet karke samast sindh gurjar pratihaar samrajya kaa abhinn ang bana liya tha
 Only Mansura and Multan remained in Sindh near the two Arabs because the Arabs had built caves called Anmahfuz in order to escape the stormy fierce invasions of the Gurjara Pratihara emperor in which Arabs hid their lives
 samraat mihir bhoj nahi chaahate the ki arab in do sthanon par bhi surakshit rahen or aage sankat kaa kaaran bane isliye usne kai bade sainik abhiyaan bhej kar imran bin musa ke anamhafooj naamak jagah ko jeet kar gurjar pratihaar samrajya kii pashchimi simaaen sindh nadi se sainkadon mile pashchim tak panhucha di or isi prakaar bharat desh ko agali shatabdiyon tak arabon ke barbar, dharmandh tathaa atyaachaari akramanon se surakshit kar diya tha

 The army of the south fought the battle of the king of Balhara and the other two forces in two directions
 samraat mihir bhej in chaaron senaaon kaa sanchaalan, maargdarshan tathaa niyantran swayan karata tha
 Like his ancestor Gurjara Pratihara Emperor Nagabhat I, Emperor Mihir Bhoja, like his ancestors, raised a standing army which was necessary to compete with the Arab invaders! If other emperors after Nagabhatta had not kept a permanent, trained and skilled and patriotic army, then the history of India would have been different and nothing called Indian culture and civilization would have survived
 jab arab senaayen sindh praant par adhikaar karne va usko muslim raashtra main parivartit karne ke baad samast bharat ko muslim raashtra banane ke liye senapati mohammad juned ke netritv main aage badi, to unhen sindh se mili gurjar pradesh ko jeetna jaruri tha
 So they started terrible attacks

 The Hindu warriors considered the attack on the sleeping soldiers in the night against religion, but the Muslim invader would attack at any time during the night, such terrible wars continued in Arabs and Gurjaro
 kabhi rankshetra main bhinmaal, kabhi hakadaa nadi kaa kinaaraa, kabhi bhadauch va vallabhi nagar tak arabon ke prahaar ho jate the
 Some cities were damaged and some cities were destroyed
 jan dhan kii baari haani gurjaro ko yuddh main uthaani padi jinka prabhaav agle yudhon par padaa
 For twelve years, many famous cities like Bhinmal etc
 were badly destroyed and many dynasties were destroyed and the condition of many was greatly deteriorated, but the brave heroes of Arya religion and culture did not lose courage
 kashmir kaa samraat shankar varman mihir bhoj kaa mitra tha
 At the time of Mihir Bhoja, the Arabs tried hard to increase their power in India, but the brave Hindu emperor drove the Arabs out of Kutch where they started moving
 is vir samraat ne apane baahubal se khalipha kaa adhikaar sindh se bhi hataa liya
 Mihir Bhoja's official, Alakhan Kabul, continued to help King Lalip of Hindushahi dynasty against the invasions of the Arabs, because Kabul Kandhar was part of India at that time

 nitrogen yogikikaran us prakriya ko kehete hai he jiske dwaara prithvi ke vayumandal kii nitrogen, ammonium]] yaa or jeevon ke liye laabhadaayak anya anuon main parivartit kii jaati he 
 Atmospheric nitrogen or molecular nitrogen is a relatively inert substance that it does not readily react with other chemicals to form new compounds
 kintu yogeekaran kii prakriya se N≡N bandh se nitrogen parmaanu ko mukt kar detaa he or yah mukt nitrogen duusare tareekon se upyog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Nitrogen fixation is essential for vegetative and some other organisms because inorganic nitrogen is required for basic formation of organisms, and for biological synthesis
 Therefore, as part of the nitrogen cycle, it is necessary for agriculture and fertilizer manufacturing
 It is, indirectly, essential for the manufacture of all nitrogen-containing chemical compounds, including explosives, most medicines, and chemical dyes
 nitrogen yogikikaran sookshm jeevanu, jaise ezotobacter, dwaara mitti main prakritik rup se kiya jaataa he
 Some nitrogen-fixing bacteria coexist with certain plant groups, especially legumes
 nitrogen-phixing bacteria or paudhon ke bich kabhi kabhi sampoornat: sahjivit sambandh sambandh nahin hote he
 jaise kii chaaval kii jaden par nitrogen ke nirdhaaran main dekha jaataa he
 akashiya vidyut ke dwaara vaataavaran main nox ke utpaadan kii prakriya main bhi nitrogen yogikikaran kaa upyog hota he 
 All biological nitrogen fixation is done through a metalloenzyme called nitrogenase
 in anzimon main loha hota he, aksar ek duusari dhaatu ke saath, jo kii aamtaur par molibdenum hota he par kabhi-kabhi vanadium bhi
 Microorganisms that can determine nitrogen are prokaryotes known as diazotrophs
 kuch ucch shrenee ke paudhon, or kuch jeev, dyjotroph ke saath sahjivit sambandh kaa gathan kar sakate hai
 Aerial electricity can convert oxygen and nitrogen into nox in the atmosphere
 yah ek prakaar kii gaiyr jaivik prakritik nitrogen yogikikaran prakriya he
 nox pani ke saath pratikriya kar ke nitras acid yaa nitric acid ban saktaa he, or mitti main ris kar yah paudhon ke liye upjau nitrate ban jaataa he| Biological nitrogen fixation was discovered by German agronomist Hermann Hellerigel and Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beiernik
 The addition of organic nitrogen occurs through the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia by an enzyme called nitrogenase
 In free-living diazotrophs, nitrogen-generated ammonium glutamine synthetase / glutamate synthesizes into glutamate via the synthase pathway
 nitrogen yogikeekaran ke liye aavashyak microbial jin prakruti main vyapak rup se vitarit hoti hai
 Enzymes responsible for nitrogenase addition are often susceptible to oxygen and oxygen can cause their destruction
 is kaaran se, kai jeevanu oxigen kii upasthiti main anzime ke utpaadan ko samaapt kar dete hai
 Many nitrogen-fixing organisms only exist in anaerobic conditions and respire to lower oxygen levels, or bind oxygen with proteins such as lethemoglobin
 dyleotroph prokarots kaa ek vividh samooh he jisamen sinobacteria, hari sulfur bacteria, ezotobacteriese, risobia or frankia shaamil hai | The process of ethanol sexualization can be both natural and artificial

 upanyaas gadhy lekhan kii ek vidha he
 Ernest A
 While defining the novel, Baker described it as the best means of interpreting life and society through proselytizing plot
 yon to vishwasahitya kaa prarambh hi sambhavat: kahaniyon se hua or ve mahakavyon ke yug se aaj tak ke sahitya kaa merudand rahi hai, phir bhi upanyaas ko aadhunik yug kii dein kahana adhik samichin hoga
 The use of prose in literature represents an accurate depiction of life
 saadhaaran bolchaal kii bhashaa dwaara lekhak ke liye apane paatro, unki samasyaon tathaa unke jivan kii vyapak prishthbhumi se pratyaksh sambandh sthapit karnaa aasaan ho gaya he
 While the epics have a clear glimpse of artificiality and idiosyncratic tendencies, the modern novelist sees the significance of his art in presenting a nude depiction of the characteristics of life
 yatharth ke prati aagrah kaa ek anya parinaam yah hua ki katha sahitya ke apaurushey tathaa alokik tatv, jo pracheen mahakavyon ke vishisht ang the, purnataya lupt ho gaye
 The imagination of the narrator is now bordered
 yatharth kii paridhi ke baahar jaakar manachaahi udaan lenaa uske liye praaia: asambhav ho gaya
 The emergence and development of the novel coincided with scientific progress
 ek ore jahaan vigyaan ne vyakti tathaa samaaj ko samanya dharaatal se dekhne tathaa chitrit karne kii prarena di vahiin duusari ore usne jivan kii samasayaaon ke prati ek nae drushtikon kaa bhi sanket kiya
 This approach was mainly intellectual
 upanyaaskaar ke upar kuch nae uttardaayitv aa gaye the
 Now his practice was not limited to the problems of art, but expected wider social awareness
 vastut: aadhunik upanyaas saamaajik chetana ke kramik vikaas kii kalatmak abhivyakti he
 The comprehensive and all-round picture of life found in the novel is not available in any other form of literature
 saamaajik jivan kii vishad vyakhya prastut karne ke saath hi saath aadhunik upanyaas vaiyaktik charitra ke sookshm adhyayan kii bhi suvidha pradaan karata he
 In fact, the story of the novel's origins is intertwined with the freedoms earned as a result of the European revival
 itihaas ke is mahatvapurn daur ke uparaant maanav ko, jo ab tak samaaj kii ikai ke rup main hi dekha jaataa tha, vaiyaktik pratashtha mili
 The social bonds of the feudalistic era were loosened and a free environment was found for the development of human personality
 yatharthonmukh pravritiyon ne maanav charitra ke adhyayan ke liye bhi ek nayaa drushtikon diya
 The tradition of simple classification of human character is going on in literature till now
 paatr yaa to purnataya bhale hote the yaa ekadam gaye gujarey
