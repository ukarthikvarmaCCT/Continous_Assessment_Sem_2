 jab kaajal peshey se abhiyantaa raaj se shaadi karti he, to vah or uske pita, swachaalit rup se maanate hai ki vah amir he
 Even in the birth of two children and many years of marriage, it does not change

 She first meets Kajal at a shop where they both go to Raj to buy cassette players
 parivaar jahnavi kaa diya hua tepe sunata he jisamen wo apana pyaar kabool karti he
 In an attempt to marry Raj, Jahnavi meets the greedy Kajal inside the Ganesh temple in the city

 She then uses the money found in the deal to buy a huge mansion and several cars
 vah jo bangala kharidti he vah nisha kaa nikalataa he
 Kajal then taunts her saying that she has fulfilled her dreams, while Nisha's dreams are now broken after losing everything
 nisha ne kaajal ko yaad dilaayaa ki usne apana ghar or sampatti ko apane biimaar pati ke ilaaj ke liye bech diya, jabaki kaajal ne apane pati ko dhan ke liye bech diya he; or kuch had tak, kaajal usase se bhi garib he
 Kajal molded herself into an influential person, ignoring her family
 raaj shuruyaat main kaajal dwaara khaarij kiya gaya mahasoos karata he or jahnavi ke kareeb nahin gaya
 But the children and Raj find a partner with Jahnavi, who watches them with love and affection

 Kajal tries to improve
 jab kuch bhi kaam nahin karata, tab kaajal jahnavi ko thappad maarthi he or use apane pati ko chura lene kaa aarope lagaati he
 She then tries to throw Jahnavi out of the house, but to no avail, as Raj decides to go with Jahnavi
 bachche bhi jahnavi or unke pita ke saath rahane kaa faisla karte hai
 Kajal, on the other hand, becomes distraught after leaving her family
 apana sabhi dhan wo daan karti he
 When she learns that Raj and the children are going to America, she goes to the airport
 vah unhen jane ke liye taiyaar paati he
 But at the last minute, Jahnavi tells Raj that she is going to America alone, but she is not really alone
 vah raaj ke bachche kii ummid kar rahi he
 Jahnavi admits that although Kajal had sold her husband, it was she who offered to buy him and thus he should pay his dues

 This action can be expressed, for example, by the following equation: Magnesium turnings placed on a flask
 Covered with THF and a small piece of iodine added
 a solution of alkyl bromide was added while heating
 After completion of the addition, the mixture was heated for a while
 Formation of the Grignard reagent had completed
 a small amount of magnesium still remained in the flask
 The Grignard reagent thus prepared was cooled to 0 ° c before the addition of carbonyl compound
 The solution became cloudy since the Grignard reagent precipitated out
 a solution of carbonyl compound was added to the Grignard reagent
 The solution was warmed to room temperature
 The reaction was complete

 Following the footsteps of his father Graziano Rossi, Rossi began racing for the Aprilia Grand Prix in 1996 in the 125cc class

 vailentino rosi urabino main paidaa hue, tab unka parivaar tawulia chalaa gaya
 The son of former motorcycle racer Graziano Rossi, he first started driving at a very young age
 racing main rosi kaa pehla pyaar go-cart tha
 Graziano bought a go-kart as an alternative to the bike after his mother, Stephania, fueled by his son's safety
 As the Rossi family wanted to move faster, they looked forward to the redesign; At that time, Graziano replaced the 60cc motor with a 100cc national cart motor for his 5-year-old son
 1990 main rosi ne kshetreey cart championships jeeta

 1992 or 1993 ke dauraan, vailentino ne minemito racing ke aantarik or bahari pahaluon ko siikhnaa jari rakhaa
 In 1993, with the help of his father, he drove a Cagiva Milto 125cc motorcycle by Virginio Ferrari, Claudio Castiglioni and Claudio Lusvardi, which he damaged in a first-corner crash by going less than a hundred meters from the pit lane
 He finished ninth on race weekend
 haalanki italian spot production main unka pehla sijan alag rahaa, misaano main sijan ke aakhri res main unhone agr sthaan hasil kiya, jahaan unhen antat: podium tak pahunchnaa tha
 In the second year, Rossi was given the Milto Factory by Lucciardi and won the Italian title

 Rossi had some success in the World Championship season in 1996, but he failed to complete the five races of the season and competed several times
 Despite this, in August he won his first World Championship Grand Prix at the AGV Aprilia RS125R in Brno, Czech Republic
 He finished ninth at the end of the season and then won 11 out of the 15 races, retaining his dominance in the 125cc World Championship in the 1997 season
 1998 tak aprilia RS250 apane sheersh par pahunch gaya or valintino rosi, loris capirosi or tetsuya harada ko lekar uski ek team ban gayi
 He was deeply shocked by the death of two of his friends in a car accident
 He later finished second at the end of the 1998 125cc season, just three points behind Capirossi
 However, in 1999, he won the title by collecting five first place and 9 wins

 Rossi won his first title in 2001, the last year of this category of the 500cc World Championship
 Two-strokes were allowed in the 500cc the following year, but 2002 saw the introduction of the 990cc four-stroke motogp class, after which the 500cc machines became essentially obsolete
 That year, Rossi rode the Honda VTR1000SPW with American rider Colin Edward in the Suzuka 8 Arrange Endurance Race
 The pair won the race despite Rossi's inexperience in superbike racing

 It was more than the same for Rossi's rivals as it was in 2003, winning nine gps to claim the third consecutive World Championship, with nine leading places
 bahut saare prekshkon kaa maananaa he ki anokhi paristhitiyon ke kaaran 2003 main philip island main australian GP rosi ke kariyar ke liye bahut hi acha samay tha
 The front-running Rossi continued to move in fear of falling behind, after Ducati's rider Troy Bellis was fined 10 seconds for overtaking while showing a yellow flag when he was hit, eventually finishing the race 15 seconds earlier Did, which was more than the penalty was canceled and won the race
 rosi ke bhavishya yojana ko lekar 2003 sijan kii duusari chamahi ke dauraan atakalon kaa bazaar garm tha
 Some suspected that he would hardly succeed in retaining his title for the third consecutive year and expressed doubts about his position in the future

 Rumors spread that he would probably move to Duketi in the middle of the season, causing a frenzy in the Italian press; The concept of Great Italy began to seem incredibly true with the famous Italian bike
 Ducati actually tried to woo Rossi through his motogp bike Desmosediki, but Rossi turned down the offer for several reasons
 Critics point out that compared to other manufacturers, despite Rossi's backing, the shopkeeper had to travel a significant distance before competing
 Duketi's poor performance in the 2004 season proved this to be true, which was, in fact, worse than his inaugural year at motogp in 2003
 2005 main apni aatmakatha, "whot iff ai’da nevar trid it?", main dukaiti ke bajaae yamaha ko chunane ke peeche rosi ne ek anya kaaran bataate hue kaha ki dukaiti korese ke liye man bananaa or honda se bachane kii koshish lagbhag ek jaisi baat thi
 Eventually Rossi signed a two-year contract with rival Yamaha, which was more than $ 12 million, an amount no manufacturer, even Honda, was willing to pay
 kuch tippaneekaron kaa kahana he ki ek ghatiya mashin ke jariye rosi apane pichley saal ke vishwa championships jeet ko dubaara hasil karne main sakasham nahin ho paaenge, khaskar RC211V main parivardhan or honda ke maiks biyagi tathaa sete giberno jaison ke hone kii vajah se
 har pahalu se RC211V bahut hi behatar mashin thi, haalanki yah apekshit tha ki rosi or jeremi burgess ke chale jane se faasla kam ho jayega
 The traditional first race of the season began in 2004 in Welkom, South Africa, after Suzuka was dropped from the list for security reasons
 Rossi won the race and became the only rider to win consecutive races with various manufacturers, winning the final race with Honda last season

 In the 2005 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season, Rossi won his 7th World Championship title and 5th consecutive motogp Championship
 She scored a total of 367 points, which is 147 points more than second-placed Marco Melandri and Nikki Haden finished third with 206 points
 2006 motogp sijan ek baar phir rosi ke saath shuru hua, championships ke liye ve pasandida rahe, lekin sijan ke purvarddh main unka pradarshan acha nahin rahaa

 Rossi adopted Bridgestone tires for 2008
 He got off to a slow start to the season by finishing fifth in Qatar, but recorded his first win in Shanghai and won the subsequent two races
 Rossi has won all the other races since that race, winning a total of nine races this season
 His victory in Laguna Seca and the shortened race due to rain in Indianapolis led to Rossi winning every current circuit of the calendar
 His win at Motegi was his first win on a motogp bike

 At one time there was not even Max's name in his website, instead he would have put the shiny "XXX xxrep 6 x " where his name would be required
 Although there was never a race between them before 2000, the rivalry between the two started increasing from the mid-90s
 The rivalry came to an end due to Rossi's consecutive World Championship victories and Biaggi's struggle to support and the consistent rhythm of his race
 apni aatmakatha "whot iff ai had nevar trid it" main rosi ne biegi ke saath apni pratidwandvita ke kaarnon ke bare main anek baaten kahi hai or kuch ghatnaon kaa bhi zikr kiya he jinase isamen vruddhi hui

 Several teams, including Gibernau's team and the official Repsol Honda factory team, successfully appealed for Rossi to approve race directions

 During his racing career, Valentino Rossi received many nicknames
 His first major surname was "rossifumi"

 hindi main aiyaari or tilsmi upanyaason ke janak devaki nandan khatri jab chandrakanta ke saath hindi main prakat hue to praayah usee kaal main ambika dutt vyas virachit aashcharya-vrittant ne bhi hindi main vigyaan galp lekhan kii nayi sarani nirmit kii
 It was published serially in the magazine 'peus Pravah' between 1884-88
 ‘aashcharyavrittant’ vishuddh rup se vigyaan galp tha jo tilsmi or jasusi prabhaavon se sarvatha unmukt tha
 On the other hand, in the Bengali language "panch Kauri De", when detective literature - 'incident-umbrella', 'jai-parajaya', 'jeevan Rahasya', 'neel Vasna Sundari', 'mayavi', '- were trending in the same period
 Science fiction was also being written in it, rather it should be said that the science fiction in Bangla had preceded it
 paudhon main jivan ke vishleshak or betaar ke avishkaarak acharya jagadish chandra bose ne ‘tufaan par vijay’ sheershak se pratham bangla vigyaan galp 1897 main hi likhaa tha
 Anadidhan Bannerji presented novels like 'van Kusum', 'champa Phool', 'chor' as well as science fiction like 'mars'
 marathi main shridhar baalkrishna ranade ne pehali vigyaan katha ‘tareche hasya’ sheershak se 1915 main likhi thi
 Around this time, Nath Madhav presented a scientific novel called 'srinivasa Rao' in Marathi
 devaki nandan khatri ne mirzapur ke aranyon kii prishthbhumi main jo andrajalik sansar rachaa, usase hindi pathak vismit or vimudh rah gaya or usne khatri ji ko haathon haath liya
 Khanni Praneet 'narendramohini' 'virendra Veer', 'chandrakanta Santi', 'kusum Kumari', 'naulakha Haar', 'guptagodna'
 The 'paper closet', the unique Begum, 'bhootnath' crossed all limits of popularity
 devaki nandan khatri ke indrajaal kaa jaadu pathakon ke sir par chadhakar bolne laga
 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla has written in 'history of Hindi Literature' that Urdu speakers learned Hindi to enjoy Khatri's Tilasmi literature
 to aisa tha khatri kaa andrajalik sansar ! What is the reader, even contemporary writers could not live without being enthralled by this magic
 phir tilsmi sahitya rachane ke sarthak prayaas aarambh hue or prabhoot maatra main aisi chijen saamne aane lageen or hindi pathak usamen sarabor ho gaya
 The rich tradition of such writers is seen in this period
 devi prasad upaadhyaay krit ‘maaya-vilaas’, jagannatha chaturvedi krit ‘vasant-malti’, hare krishna johar krit ‘kusum lata’, ‘bhayanak prem’, saraswati gupta krit ‘rajkumaar’, bal mukund verma krit ‘kamini’, rajendra mohini, hare krishna johar krit ‘nari-pishaach’, ‘manyak-mohini’, ‘jaadugar’ tathaa ‘camel kumari’, madan mohan pathak krit ‘anand sundari’, munni laal khanni krit ‘sachcha bahadur’, hare krishna johar krit ‘niraala nakaabposh’ tathaa ‘bhayanak khun’, kishori laal goswami krit ‘kate mud kii do-do baaten’, vishweshwar prasad verma krit, ‘virendra kumaar’, kishori laal goswami krit ‘yakuti takhti’, ram laal verma krit ‘putalimahal’, rup kishor jain krit ‘surya kumaar sambhav’ aadi isi sahitya kii pratinidh rachanaaen hai
 This tradition continued in the future, but it is from here that tilasmi literature should often be considered as an end
 yah bhi ek vicitra sanyog he ki tilsmi sahitya ke saath-saath jasusi kii bhi achaanak baadh aa gayi or bhi pathakon ne saraahaa or apanaaya
 The detective novels in Hindi are Preeta Gopal Ram Gahmari
 devaki nandan khatri kii ‘chandrakanta’ or ‘narendra mohini’ ke thode samyantaral baad ‘adbhut laash’ or ‘guptchar’ ke saath gahamri bhi udit hue
 Inspired by the growing popularity of these detective novels, Gahmari created such a plethora of literature - 'baekasoor ki hanga', 'sarkati corpse', 'who is the murderer?', 'blood of innocent', 'blood of Jamuna', 'double 'spies', 'mayawini', 'sorceress Manorama' 1901), 'girl Chori', 'spy Ki Bhool', 'police Station's theft', 'robbery theft', 'blind eye', 'trap King', 'fake Kaka' , 'detective Theft,' 'theft in Warehouse', 'robbery on Robbery', 'doctor's Story', 'piercing the House', 'detective Detective ',' Devi Singh '
 'boy missing', 'detective Chakkar', 'killer's distinction', 'bhojpur's thief'

 lekin yaheen se yah parampara samaptpraaya he
 The reason is that this tradition was new in Hindi and completely influenced by Anglo literature
 bhartiya vaataavaran ke anuroop na hone ke kaaran pathak jaldi isse ub gaya
 The anorexia of the readers also made tilasmi, ayari and espionage literature in abeyance itself
 premchand ke avataran ke saath hi chitrapat puri tarah parivartit ho chukaa tha
 Tilasmi and espionage literature went into the background around 1917-18
 beesvin shatee ke tisare dashak main manovaigyanik or ghatana pradhan upanyaason ne dastak di
 The readership was in search of newness
 vah formulabaddh sahitya se nijaat paanaa chahta tha

 premchand ke ‘durgadas’ or chatur sen shastri ke ‘rana raaj singh’ ne to aiyaari-tilsmi-jasusi sahitya kaa tirodhan kara diya or yaheen se yah parampara samaapt ho gayi
 While writing about Hindi science fiction, people often refer to Keshav Prasad Singh's 'chandralok Ki Yatra' as the first science fiction
 abhi tak aisa hi abhimath he
 Perhaps the reason for this is the commentary of Pt
 Srinarayan Chaturvedi that he gave at the beginning of the story section of 'diamond Jubilee special issue' published to commemorate 60 years of 'saraswati' magazine
 ‘saraswati’ ke bhaag 1, sankhya 6, main pahili baar do kahaniyaan ek saath prakashit hui
 Kishori Lal Goswami's 'indumati' and Keshav Prasad Singh's 'travel to Chandralok'
 chaturvedi ji in par tippanee karte hai-duusari kahani kisi angreji kahani ke aadhaar par likhi hui maaloom hoti he
 She is tall and was published serially
 ‘indumati’ saraswati hi main nahin, hindi main aadhunik style kii pratham kahani he
 ' ‘chandralok kii yatra’ ko to unhone angl-aadhrut kahkar mahatvaheen kar diya lekin ‘indumati’ ko pahili hindi kahani ghoshit kiya
 'earlier' Harishchandra Chandrika 'and' Piyush Pravah 'had one or two stories
 pan ambika dutt vyas kii ‘aashcharya-vrittant’ naam kii or pan bal krishna bhatta kii ‘nutan brahychari’ naamak kahaniyaan sambhawatah iske pahile kii prakashit ho chuki thim
 But 'indumati' is credited with being the first modern story of Hindi
 ’ Probably he ended his talk by saying, but if there had been an attempt to investigate it, then the confusion would have ended which is the first Hindi science fiction? Although this discussion continues in Hindi, which is the first modern story of Hindi
 


‘indumati’ ? insha allaa khan kii 1803 main prakashit ‘rani ketki kii kahani ? yaa phir 1870 main prakashit meerut main pan gauri dutt pranit ‘devraani jethaani kii kahani’ jo vastutah ek laghu saamaajik upanyaas he

 It was built in a place called Varnavat
