 As a final level of complexity, some applications also have their own DNS cache, so that they reduce the use of DNS resolver libraries / libraries themselves
 isamen atirikt mushkil tab or jud jaati he jab DNS muddon kii dibging hoti he, kyonki yah data kii taazgi kaa pataa lagaana or / yaa yah bataanaa ki data kis cash se aa rahaa he, kathin bana detaa he
 These caches typically employ very short caching times - on the order of one minute
 internet explorer ek ullekhneey apwaad prastut karata he : recent ke anusaar sanskaran aadhe ghante tak DNS record ko cash karata he
 The system mentioned above provides some simple scenarios
 domen naam pranali ke kuch anya kaary hai : DNS primarily uses the user datagram protocol on port number 53 to answer the request
 DNS poochtacha main graahak dwaara puche gayi ek UDP prashn kaa jawaab sarwar dwaara ek UDP parinaam dwaara diya jaataa he
 The transmission control protocol is used when the data size as a response exceeds 512 bytes or is used in tasks such as zone transfers
 kuch oparating system jaise ki HP-UX main kuch aise risolver lagu kiye gayi hai jo ki sabhi tarah kii poochtacha main TCP kaa tab bhi prayog karte hai, jab iske liye keval UDP hi paryaapt he
 a resource record is the fundamental data element in the domain name system
 prayek record main ek prakaar, ek samay samaapti seemaa, ek varg or kuch vishesh prakaar ke data hote hai
 The same type of resource record defines a resource record set
 ek set main risource record kaa aadesh aparibhaashit he, jo risolver dwaara aplicoshan ko bheja jaataa he, lekin aksar sarwar lod santulan praapt karne ke liye round robin aadesh lagu karte hai
 DNSSEC, however, works on the entire resource record in a statutory order
 ek IP network par bheje jane vaale sabhi record RFC 1035 or neeche dikhaae gayi aam praaroop kaa prayog karte hai
 NAME / name is the fully qualified domain name of a tree node
 vir par, label sampeedan kaa prayog karke naam ko chota kiya ja saktaa he jahaan vartmaan domen naam kaa chor packet main pehle se hi ullekh kiye gayi maujuuda domen naam ke chor se badale ja sakate hai
 type / type is the type of record
 yah data kaa swaroop bataata he or apane uddeshy kaa sanket detaa he
 For example, the a record is used to translate a domain name to an ipv4 address, the NS record displays a list of which name servers in a DNS zone can respond to lookup, and the MX record matches that mail
 Specifies the server that controls the mail for the domain specified in an e-mail address
 
 RDATA is a type-specific data such as IP address for address / address records or as the host name for priority and MX records
 Known record types may use label compression in the RDATA field, but "unknown" types must not be excluded
 internet hostnem, sarwar yaa IP pate main main shaamil aam DNS record ke liye, record ke varg ko IN ke liye set kiya jaataa he
 Additionally, the CH and HS classes also exist
 prayek varg DNS zone ke sambhavit vibhinn deligeshnon ke saath ek puri tarah se swatantra vriksh he
 In addition to the resource records defined in the zone file, the domain name system also defines several types of requests, which are used only in communication with other DNS nodes, such as for zone transfers or EDNS
 domen naam pranali wildcard domen naam kaa samarthan karti he jo aise naam hai jo esterisk label, '*', ke saath shuru hote hai jaise, *
example
 The DNS record associated with the wildcard domain name sets the rules for generating the resource name in a DNS zone, subtracting the name from all the labels to match the name, including the specified lineage
 udhaaharan ke liye, DNS zone x
example main, nimnlikhit seoup bataata he ki x
example ke sabhi upadomen mail excanger a
x
example kaa upyog karte hai
 a record is needed for axexample to specify the mail exchanger
 chunki yah parinaam wildcard ke milan se domen nem tathaa ise upadomen chhod kar praapt hua he, a
x
example ke sabhi upadomen wildcard parinaamon main avashya paribhaashit hone chahien
 The role of wildcard records was refined in RFC 4592 because the original definition in RFC 1034 was incomplete and due to which the enforcers were not being interpreted correctly
 mul DNS protocol main nai suvidhaon ke vistaar ke liye simit praavdhaan the
 In 1999 Paul Vixie made public in RFC 2671 an extension system called the extension mechanism for DNS that had optional protocol elements that were not used without increasing costs
 aisa banaavati risource record opt ke madhyam se kiya gaya jo keval protocol ke taar prasaaran main maujuud tha, kintu kisi bhi zone filon main nahin tha
 Initial extensions were also suggested, such as increasing the size of the DNS message in the UDP datagram
 ek aadhikarik DNS sarwar par zone data base main rakhe ricardon ko dinemic DNS apadet ke apadet DNS opcode kii sahaayta se jod yaa hataa kar, dinemic dhang se apadet karata he
 This feature is described in RFC 2136
 is suvidha se DNS main network ke graahakon ko register kiya jaataa he jab ve boot karte hai yaa network par uplabdh hote hai
 Since the booting client can be assigned a different IP address each time by the DHCP server, it is not possible to provide static DNS for such clients

 ICANN has approved the Punycode-based IDNA system, which converts Unicode sentences into valid character sets while working on the subject
 kuch registrion ne bhi IDNA ko sweekaar kar liya he
 Initially security was not taken into consideration when creating DNS
 kamiyon kaa ek swaroop DNS cash dooshit hona he, jo DNS sarwar ko yah vishwaas dilaataa he ki pramanik jaankaree praapt ho gayi he jabaki vaastaviktaa main aisa nahin hota
 Traditionally DNS results are not signed by cryptography, which increases the chances of an attack; The Domain Name System security extension converts DNS to give results signed by cryptography
 zone sthaanantaran jaankaree kaa samarthan karne kai vistaar bhi uplabh hai
 Even by encryption, a DNS server compromises a virus that will direct the server's IP address to an incorrect address with a long TTL
 yah internet upyogkartaaon ke lakhon logon par doorgaami sambhavit prabhaav daal sakate hai, agar vyast DNS sarwar kharaab IP data ko cash kar letaa he
 To finish this all the affected DNS cache has to be manually cleared which can be up to long TTL
 kuch domen naam duusare, milte julate domen naamon ke dwaara dhokhaa de sakate hai
 For example, "paypal
com" and "paypa1
com" are different names, yet the user may be unable to distinguish when the user's type face does not explicitly indicate the difference between the letter l and the digit 1
 This problem is more severe in systems that support internationalized domain names

 In addition to ICANN, each top-level domain that operates the registry is overseen and technically serviced by an administrative organization
 ek registry apane adheen TLD main panjikrut naam ke databes ke rakrakhaav ke liye jimmedaar he
 The registry receives information for registration from a domain name registrar, which is authorized to assign names to the corresponding TLD and publishes / publishes the information using a specialized service, the whois protocol
 registry or register aam taur par ek upyogkarta ke liye ek domen naam pradaan karne or ek naam sarwar ke difolt set uplabdh karaane kii seva ke liye ek vaarshik shulk lete hai
 Often this transaction is called the sale or lease of the domain name and the registrant may also be called the "owner", but in fact there is no such legal relationship associated with this transaction, the only specific use of the domain name Get the right
 adhik sahi dhang se, adhikrut upyogkarta "panjikrut" yaa "domen dharakon" ke rup main jane jate hai
 ICANN publishes a complete list of TLD registries and domain name registrars in the world

 Particularly notable is the verisign site finder system that sent all unregistered 
com and

 udhaaharan ke liye, verisign ke saath ek saarvajanik sabha main sitefinder ke bare main takneekee chintaaon par bahes karte hue, IETF or anya takneekee sansthaaon main sakriy kai logon ne samajhaayaa ki ve kaise verisign dwaara, internet kii buniyadi suvidhaon ke ek pramukh ghatak ke badalane se chakit the, jisane iske liye aam sahmati praapt nahin kii thi
 sitefinder was first used for every Internet query from the website and used the wrong domain name for queries to earn money by directing the user to the verisign search site
 durbhaagya se, anya aplicoshan jaise ki email ke kai prayogon, prashn ke uttar kii kami ke kaarnon, ne ek sanket diya ki domen maujuud nahin he or yah sandesh na bheje sakane yogya sandesh ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he
 The original verisign implementation broke this notion for mail, as it always sent the wrong domain name to sitefinder
 jabaki verisign ne baad main email ke saath sitefinder kaa vyavhaar badal diya, phir bhi verisign dwaara kiye gayi is krity ke bare main ghor virodh pradarshan kiya gaya ki kaise verisign ne internet sanrachana ghatak, jisaki suraksha kaa jimmevaar verisign tha, ke hit ke bajaae apane vittiya hiton kii taraf adhik dhyaan diya
 Despite widespread criticism, verisign reluctantly removed it after the Internet Corporation threatened to cancel the contract to manage the root name server in order to provide the name and number

 The era of St
 Thomas Aquinas was an extraordinary era, both intellectually and religiously
 yah yug purna sanshleshan kaa yug tha
 This era was an era of complete synthesis in which the emphasis was on the communist approach
 yah vidwatawaad kaa yug tha jisamen jivan darshan kii naitik, saamaajik, raajnneetik, aarthik va anya samasyaon kaa sundar samavesh tha
 There were two main characteristics of scholasticism - tact and belief
 is yug main carch ke sarvachchata siddhanth kii taarkik yaa yuktiparak vyakhya karke yah spasht kiya gaya ki carch siddhanth tark ke vipareet nahin he
 Scholarship is an attempt to coordinate faith and tact, and between Greekism and Churchism, and to integrate all kinds of knowledge

 It is a generalized and well-informed summary of the sciences
 ye donon manzil maanav tark kaa pratik hai jinka samanvay va niyantran dharmadashran dwaara hona chahie
 Religion philosophy is the most important floor of the building
 yah dharm-darshan isai prakashna par nirbhar he jo darshanashastra tathaa vigyaan se sarvshereshth he
 Theology or Philosophy completes the system whose starting points are science and philosophy
 jis prakaar vivek darshan kaa aadhaar he, usee prakaar dharm-vigyaan kaa aadhaar vishwaas he
 There is no conflict between these two
 ve ek-duusare ke poorak hai
 Hence the mixture of both makes the building of knowledge stronger

 Thus Aquinas has coordinated three great intellectual ideologies of medievalism - Universalism, Scholasticism and Aristotleism

 He was also a Rajya Sabha MP
 unke sampaadakatv main hindi main kolkata se 'vishaal bharat' naamak hindi masik niklaa
 Sudhi thinkers like Pt
 Banarsidas Chaturvedi had first taken a meaningful step to flourish and flourish the mode of interview
 unki saahitiyik sevaaon ke liye unhen padmabhushan se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 He was a pioneer editor of his time and is known for his distinguished and independent instinct
 unke jaisaa shaheedon kii smriti kaa puraskarta or chhayavaad kaa virdohi samooche hindi sahitya main koi or nahin hua
 Banarasidas Chaturvedi is honored in his memory
 kehete hai ki ve kisi bhi nai saamaajik, saanskrithik, saahitiyik yaa rashtriya muhim se judane, nae kaam main haath daalane yaa nai rachana main pravrutt hone se pehle swayan se ek hi prashn poochhate the ki usase desh, samaaj, uski bhashaaon or saahitiyon, visheshkar hindi kaa kuch bhala hoga yaa maanav jivan ke kisi bhi kshetra main ucchtar mulyon kii pratishtha hogi yaa nahin? Born on December 24 in 1892 AD in Firozabad, Uttar Pradesh, Chaturvedi ji, after passing the Inter examination in 1913, was appointed as a teacher at the Government High School in Farrukhabad, nearby, at a monthly salary of thirty rupees
 lekin abhi kuch hi maheene beete the ki unke guru pandit lakshmidhar vaajapeyi ne unhen adhyaapan chhodkar agra aane or ‘aryamitra’ sanbhaalane kaa aadesh suna diya
 Lakshmidhar Ji used to take out Aryamitra from Agra in those days
 vastav main, vaajapeyi dwarikaprasad sevak ke bulaave par unke masik ‘navajivan’ ke sampadak banane vaale the or ‘aryamitra’ ko aise sampadak ke hawaale kar janaa chaahate the, jo unke bharose par khara utar sake
 Chaturvedi ji had also agreed to Laxmidhar Vajpayee, but in the meantime he got an order for appointment in that daily college in Indore
 chaturvedi ji ko indore main pehle to da
 sampoornanand kaa saath mila, jo usee college main shikshak the, phir vahaan hindi sahitya sammelan yojit hua to uski adhyakshata karne aae mahatma gandhi ke saannnidhya va sampark ne unki lagaataar baichaiyn rahane vaali sevabhaavana va rachanaatmakataa ko nae aayam die
 When Mahatma Gandhi established the Gujarat Vidyapeeth in 1921, on his orders, Chaturvedi went there to offer his services
 isse pehle gandhiji ne chaturvedi ji se hindi ko rashtrabhasha ke taur par pratishthit karne ke apane abhiyaan ke sandarbh main desh bhar se anek manishiyon ke abhipraay ekatra karwaae, jisko pustakaakaar prakashit kiya gaya
 Chaturvedi ji had written his memoir book 'mere 21 years in Fiji Island' for Totaram Sanadhya during his teaching period in Farrukhabad and only then 'aryamitra', 'bharat Sudha Prantkar', 'navajivan' and 'maryada' etc
 His articles were started appearing in many important magazines and magazines of the time
 'phiji dweep main mere 21 varsh' ke sansmaranon main us dweep par atyant darun paristhitiyon main kaam karne vaale bharat ke pravasi girmitiyaa majazduron kii traasadee kaa bada hi samvednapravan chithran tha
 Later Chaturvedi ji, through CF Andrews, made a lot of efforts to ensure the end of the plight of these laborers
 kaaka kalelkar ke anusaar rashtriyata ke ubhaar ke un dinon main andrus jaise videshi manishiyon or maanavsevakon kaa sammaan karne kaa chaturvedi ji kaa aagrah bahut saraahneey tha
 He also stayed at Shantiniketan of Rabindranath Tagore for a few days at the invitation of Andrews
 ve andrus ko ‘deenabandhu’ kehete the or unhone unke vyaktitv va krititv par ek anya lekhak ke saath milakar angrezi main bhi ek pustak likhi he, jisaki bhoomika mahatma gandhi dwaara likhi gai he
 But he did not like the teaching work in the sense that there was a lot of stagnation in it, while his creative instinct was to find a new destination at every step
 antat ek din unhone gujarat viapeeth se avkaash lekar purnakalik patrkaar banane kaa nirnay kar daalaa
 The monthly 'vishal Bharat' published from Kolkata saw his golden period in his editing
 us samay kaa birla hi koi hindi sahityakar hoga, jo apni rachanaaen ‘vishaal bharat’ main chhapi dekhne kaa abhilaashi na rahaa ho
 Ramanand Chattopadhyay, the owner of Chaturvedi ji's favorite English paper 'modern Review', was also the owner of 'vishal Bharat'
 ve chaturvedi ji kii sampadan kushalta or vidwata ke kaayal the or chaturvedi ji bhi unka bahut sammaan karte the, lekin sampadakeey asahmati ke avasaron par majaal kya ki chaturvedi ji unka lihaaj karen
 Many such occasions were also discussed
 chaturvedi ji ganeshashankar vidhyaarthee ko mahatma gandhi ke baad apane patrakaariya jivan kii sabase badi prerana maanate the, jinaki unhone jeevani bhi likhi he
 In 1930, he went to Tikamgarh and edited a letter named 'madhukar' on the proposal of Orchha Naresh Veersingh Ju Dev
 naresh ne unhen unke nirvighn va nirbaadh sampadakeey adhikaron ke prati aashwast kar rakhaa tha lekin baad main unhone paaya ki chaturvedi ji ‘madhukar’ ko rashtriya chetana kaa vaahak or saanskrithik kranti kaa agradoot banane kii dhun main kinchit bhi ‘darbari’ nahin rahane de rahe, to uskaa prakaashan rukvaa diya
 After India became independent, Chaturvedi ji was a nominated member of the Rajya Sabha for twelve years and was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1973
 2 may, 1985 ko is duniya se vidaa lene se pehle unhone apane khate main ‘sahitya or jivan’, ‘rekhachitr’, ‘sansmaran’, ‘satyanarayan kaviratn’, ‘bharatbhakt andrus’, ‘keshavachandra sen’, ‘pravasi bharatvasi’, ‘phiji main bhartiya’, ‘phiji kii samasya’, ‘hamaare aradhy’ or ‘sethubandh’ jaisi rachanaaen jamaa kar lee thim
 He undertook many foreign trips and gave special contributions to the flowering-pallavan of many social, cultural and literary institutions and talents in India and abroad
 bhartiya krantikari andolan ke lokapriy lekhak sudhir vidhyaarthee kehete hai ki ve 1972 main chaturvedi ji dwaara sampadit agra ke ‘yuvak’ masik ke ‘swatantraaa sangram yodhank’ se prerit hokar hi krantikariyon kii kirti raksha ke mishan main lage
 He calls Chaturvedi ji as his 'guruvar' and calls himself his 'beloved student'

 After killing Jarasandha, Shri Krishna, Arjuna and Bhima returned to Indraprastha and told all the accounts from Dharmaraja Yudhishthira which they were very happy to hear

 Dharmaraja Yudhishthira duly worshiped the observers who saw the mistake of yagya while extracting the Somalata juice
 ab samast sabhaasadon main is vishay par vichaar hone laga ki sab se pehle kis devtaa kii puja kii jaye
 Then Sahadev got up and said - paramgyani sahadev ji ke vachan sunakar sabhi satpurushon ne sadhu! sadhu! kah kar pukaara
 Bhishma Pitamah himself approved and praised Sahadev's statement
 tab dharmraj yudhisthir ne shastrokt vidhi se bhagwaan shri krishna kaa pujan armbh kiya

 " shri krishna ke in vachanon ko sun kar sabha main upasthit shishupal ke saare samarthak bhay se tharra gayi kintu shishupal kaa vinaash sameep tha
 Therefore, he took the sword out of time and abused Shri Krishna again

 The concept of physical change is designed to differentiate from the concept of chemical change
 bhautik parivartan ke antargat ve sabhi parivartan aate hai jinamein padaarth kii rasinic prakruti yaa rasinic pahashan main koi parivartan nahin hota he
 Conversely, in the event of chemical changes, the composition of substances changes - one or more substances join or break up to form new substances
 kabhi-kabhi yah kahana kathin hota he ki parivartan bhautik he yaa rasinic
 For example, by dissolving a salt in water, the chemical bonds of that salt are broken; Yet it is often called physical change
 kuch log kehete hai ki rasinic parivartan main parmaanuon kaa punarvyavastha hoti he, kintu bahut se bhautik parivartanon main bhi parmaanuon kii punahvyavastha dekhne ko milti he
 Even many chemical changes are not reversible while many physical changes are reversible

 All India Students' Federation or AISF is the first student organization at India level
 12-13 agast 1 9 36 ko shanti ke naare ke saath chaatro ne isaki sthapana kii thi! pragati !! or swatantraaa !!!, swatantraaa senaniyon or us samay ke krantikariyon ke maargdarshan ke saath
 At that time, the AISF worked for India's independence
 aazaadee ke baad sanghathan shanti kaa naaraa detaa he! pragati !! or vaigyanik samaajwaad !!! isane samaan shiksha, adhikaar, nyaay or sabhi ke liye avasar ke liye andolan shuru kiya
 The organization has state committees in most states in India
 bharat ke chaatr is desh kii aazaadee ke liye lade logon ke saamne hai
 Inspired by the nation's call to rise against British imperialism and liberate the country from the colonial yoke, the students advanced in the freedom struggle
 aazaadee ke liye vir ladaai main gauravshaalee adhyay chaatr shaheedon ke yuva rakt ko likhe gaye the
 And in the furnace of this anti-colonial struggle, the All India Students Union was born in Lucknow in August 1936
 bhartiya chaatro ne samrajyavad or upniveshwaad ke khilaaf vishwavyaapee sangharsh se algaav main swatantraaa ke liye apane sangharsh ko nahin dekha
 Even in its early stages the AISF was part of the mighty warfare of patriotic forces, part of the entire force, led by the Soviet Union, against the monster of fascism
 fasiwad kii haar ke baad, esef yuvaaon ke liye behatar jivan ke liye samrajyavad ke khilaaf sangharsh ko aage badhaane ke liye international union of students or democratic youth ke vishwa sangh kii sthapana main duniya bhar ke anya fasivadi chaatr or yuva sanghathanon main shaamil ho gaya

 unhone chaatro ko raajnneeti chhodane or raashtra nirmaan ke naam par rachanaatmak gatividhiyon kii raah par jane ke liye protsaahit karte hue bhi desh main poonjeevaad banane ke liye taiyaar kiya
 Careerism was encouraged and a section of students fell into this trap, forgetting the ideals for which their elders had fought so bravely in their old days
 lekin yah charan lambey samay tak nahin tha
 The student community as a whole began to see the evils of the capitalist system from their own experience
 badhati berogari, jivan kii badhati laagat, badhati keemten, logon kaa dukh, bhukh, bhukhmaree, akaal kii maut - in sabhi ne logon ke anya virgon ke rup main chaatro kii ankhen khol deen
 The conflict broke out
 chaatro ko in ladaaiyon main se kai main aakarshith kiya gaya tha, kyonki ve samaaj ke kisi bhi anya varg ke rup main samaaj kaa hissaa hai or poonjivadi arthvyavastha ke peedit hai
 Students also waged powerful wars, strikes, and other actions on their specific demand: democratization and reform in education, democratic and political rights, jobs, socialist cultural, sports, and other recreational facilities
 chaatr in sabhi muddon par nirantar ladaai kar rahe hai
 Today AISF stands in the progress of this movement of progressive sections of students
 apane jan aadhaar ko vistaarit karne ke liye, esef ekajute hone ke liye nirantar kaam kar rahaa he or chaatr ko apane parishkrut lakshyon kii ore le jaataa he
 AISF believes that only socialism can bring about a fundamental change in the society desired by the vast majority of our students - the new system of education that will prepare students for their creative role in society, jobs for all so that the vast manpower The country is usefully employed, democratic and has political rights so that the youth can contribute to the creation of a social India

 Finally, this association became under Magadha

 Every state, whether it is liberal or socialist or communist, even the totalitarian of Pakistan ruled by the army general, calls itself democratic
 sach poocha jaae to aaj ke yug main loktantric hone ko daawa karnaa ek fishan sa ho gaya he
 It is difficult to give a completely correct and acceptable definition of democracy
 cranston ne thik hi kaha he ki loktantr ke sambandh main alag-alag dharanaen he
 According to Lancet's definition, "democracy is a political system that provides regular constitutional opportunities for office bearers to change and provides for a mechanism under which a large part of the population receives political charge
" Selecting from the interested contestants influences the decision making
 ” macmmersan ne loktantr ko paribhaashit karte hue ise ‘ek maatr aisa rachanaatantr mana he jisamen sarkaron ko chaynit or praadhikrut kiya jaataa he athwa kisi anya rup main kanoon banaae or nirnay liye jate hai
 According to Schupter, "democratic law is such an institutional system for political decision-making that serves the common interest by selecting the people who are ready to implement the common will of the people
" vastav main, loktantr multah naagarik or raajnneetik swatantraaa ke liye sahabhaagi raajnneeti se sambhddha pranali he
 The following are the main principles regarding the concept of democracy: loktantr kii udaaravaadi parampara main swatantraaa, samanta, adhikaar, dharm nirpekshata or nyaay jaisi avadharanaon kaa pramukh sthaan rahaa he or udaaravaadi chintak aarambh se hi in avadharanaon ko moort rup dene vaali sarvottam pranali ke rup main loktantr kii vakaalat karte rahe hai
 Democracy was accepted as a natural political system from the point of view of governing the society after liberation from the natives and feudal lords
 macmmersan kaa kahana he ki paashchaatya jagat main loktantr ke aagaman ke pehle hi chayan kii raajnneeti, pratiyogi rajya vyavastha or market kii rajyavyavastha jaisi avadharanaen viksit ho chuki thim
 In fact in this sense, the liberal state was democratized and not liberalized
 loktantric bhaavana ke aanrabhik chihn thomasmoor or vinstenley jaise angrej vichaarkon or angrej ativishuddhtavaad ke sahitya main paaya ja saktaa he, kintu loktantric bhaavana kii sahi shuruyaat saamaajik sanvida ke siddhanth ke janm ke saath hui, kyonki nagarikon ke saamaajik anubandh kii anternihit bhaavana hi sabhi vyaktiyon kii samanta he
 Thomas Hobbes, in his book 'leviathan' advocating the dominant democratic principle, wrote that government is formed by the people under a social contract
 jon lock kaa kahana tha ki sarkaar janata ke dwaara or usee ke hit ke liye honi chahie
 Adam Smith presented the paradigm of the free market on the democratic basis that every person has the freedom to produce, buy and sell
 prasiddh upyogetavaadi darshanik mil or bentham ne puri tarah loktantr kaa samarthan kiya or upyogetavaad ke madhyam se ise prabhavi bauddhik aadhaar pradaan kiya
 According to him, democracy provides maximum protection to utilitarianism ie maximum happiness of the people, as people expect protection from their rulers and from each other and the best ways to ensure this protection are representative democracy, constitutional government, regular Elections, secret voting, competitive party politics and majority rule
 je
 es
 mil ne bentham dwaara loktantr ke paksh main prastut tark main ek or bindu jodate hue kaha ki loktantr kisi bhi anya shashan-pranali kii tulana main maanavjaati ke naitik vikaas main sarvaadhik yogadan karata he
 In his view, democracy is the supreme medium for moral upliftment and development and expansion of individual capabilities
 is sambandh main yah ullekhya he ki bentham or mil donon main koi bhi saarvbhaum vayask matadhikaar athwa ek vyakti ek mat ke pakshdhar nahin the
 By 1802, Bentham advocated limited suffrage and in 1809 gave the slogan of limited suffrage only to the homeowners of the affluent classes and eventually called for universal suffrage in 1817, but limited this right to men
 isi prakaar mil bhi saarvbhaum vayask matadhikaar ke paksh main nahi tha, kyonki use ashanka thi ki ek varg ke log bahusankhyak hone kii sthiti apana prabhutv kaayam kar sakate he or anya virgon ke hit ke viruddh sirf apane hit ke niyam-kanoon bana sakate hai
 Later in his book 'representative Government' he advocated more than one vote for some but not the non-tax payers, illiterates, insolvents, non-tax payers, ie all those who jointly belong to the working class
 Build, deprived of it
 vah sirf ek aisi pratinidhimulak sarkaar kaa himachati tha jo aadharbhoot samaantaaon main dakhsandaji nahi karti or mukt bazaar or hastkshep kii niti apana kar chalati he
 Later liberal thinkers continued to support democracy and Western Europe and North America worked to further its acceptance
 loktantrke sambandh main puraatan udaaravaadi mat ko samay-samay par anek vichaarkon dwaara chunautiyaan milti rahi hai
 First, questions have been raised on the notion of democracy that everyone knows what is best for them
 lord brice, graham vals ityadi vichaarak maanate hai ki manushya utana vivekshil, tatasth, jaankaar athwa sakriy nahin he jitna ki prajatantr ke sanchaalan ke liye use maan liya jaataa he
 Secondly, democracy rests on the cornerstone of public governance, but it is not easy to clearly state what exactly is the meaning of 'governance' and 'public'
 isliye sarkaar ke aadhaar ke rup main lokmat ek myth he
 Thirdly, democracy is expected to work for the common good, but there can be no such thing as general interest
 kisi bhi samaaj main saamaanya hit vibhinn logon ke liye vibhinn arth rakh saktaa he
 Fourthly, the archaic liberal theory ignores factors such as group psychology, mass oppression and accreditation and genocidal leadership
 panchmatah, loktantr main daleey pranali praayah abhijatya varg kaa khel ban jaati he athwa unke dwaara niyantrit hoti he jo saadhan sampann he or ve hi mahatvapurn muddon par nirnay lete hai
 Again, the policy-making process is also quite complex
 udaarvaadiyon ne anaavashyak rup se ise saral, paardarshee or nyaaysangat maan liya he
 And the biggest error in this theory is that it is based on political equality but economic inequality
 beesvin sadi main raajnneetik vichaarkon ne prashn uthaanaa shuru kiya ki kya jansadharan pratidin ke jivan main raajnneeti main koi bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai? kya saamaanya nagarik, jo apane jivicoparjan main lage rahete hai, raajnneetik bhoomika nibhaane ke liye samay or shakti laga sakate hai? kya jansamooh bina kisi pratibandh ke chunavi loktantr ke madhyam se apni bhaawanaaon kaa khulaa pradarshan karata he to swatantraaa nasht ho jaaegi? in prashnon ke uttar main hi loktantr ke abhijanvaadee or bahulwaadi siddhanth viksit hue hai
 The term eligibility is used for a minority of a group who have special status in the community due to certain factors
 yah alpsankhyak varg samaaj main satta ke vitaran main agrani bhoomika main hota he
 The political class, according to Presthas, consumes far more power in community affairs in proportion to its numbers
 prajatantr ke sabandh main abhijan siddhanth kaa abhyuday dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad hua is siddhanth ke pravarttakon main wilfredo parato, gretanomoska, robert michels or america lekhak james bernhaam tathaa si
 rhite mills pramukh hai
 The main basis of this theory is the belief that there are two types of people in the society - a few specific legs and a large population
 vishisht log hameshaa shikhar tak pahonchte hai kyonki ve sari arhataaon se sampann sarvottam log hote hai
 The elite class, especially the political elite, perform all political acts, monopolize power and enjoy all the benefits associated with power
 bahusankhyak samooh abhijan varg dwaara manamaane dhang se niyantrit or nirdeshit hota he
 The organized minority always governs and directs the unorganized population
 robert michels ne ‘alpatantr ke louh kanoon‘ jaisi ukti kaa prayog karte hue kaha he ki saamaanya virgon ko abhijan varg kii adheenta sweekaar kerani hi chahie kyonki jansankhya kaa ek vishaal bhaag udasin karmanya or swa-shashan main aksham hota he
 The main features of the eligibility principle of democracy are: loktantr ke abhijan siddhanth kaa suvyavasthit pratipaadan sarvapratham joseph shumptor ne apni pustak ‘capitalism, socialism and demokrasi‘ main kiya
 Later Sartori, Robert Dal, Ixtaine, Raymond Aron, Carl Mann Hiemond, Sidney Verba, etc
 supported this view in their works
 loktantr kii yah avadharana is manyata par aadhaarit he ki jansankhya kaa vishaal bhaag aksham or tatasth hota he or vah yogyata or kshamta ke aadhaar par kuch logon kaa chunaav karata he jo raajnneetik dal kaa niyantrit or sanchalit karte hai
 Majority of the people are busy in earning a living
 unhen raajnneetik maamalon main na to abhiruchi hoti he, na samaj
 So they select a few people from the elite and become their followers
 abhijan siddhanth ke anusaar aaj ke jatil samaaj main kaaryakshmata ke liye visheshgyata aavashyak he or visheshgyon kii sankhya hameshaa kam hi hoti he
 Therefore, political leadership must be in the hands of such selectively competent people
 yah siddhanth logo kii atisahabhaagita ko bhi khatarnaak maanata he, kyonki taanaashaahee pravriti kaa hitler jaisaa koi taqatvar netaa satta praapt karne ke liye jansamooh ko lamaband kar loktantr ko hi khatm kar de saktaa he jiskaa sidhaa arth he moulik swatantraaaon kaa ant
 Therefore, he claims that in order to preserve democratic and liberal values, it is necessary to keep the masses separate from politics
 abhijan siddhanth ke anusaar aam janata ke dwaara vaastavik shashan ho hi nahin saktaa
 Governance is always for the people, never by the people, because the people whom the people choose to represent belong to the elite
 duusare shabdon main loktantr kaa arth he abhijan vargon ke bich pratidwandvita or janata dwaara yah nirnay ki kaunsa abhijan upar shashan karegaa
 Thus, democracy is simply a mechanism by which one of the small groups governs with minimal support from the public
 The elitist theory also believes that the leaders of the elite classes - political parties, leaders, big business houses, voluntary organizations And even a consensus among labor organizations is necessary so that the basic functioning of democracy is non-responsible
 Can be saved and leaders
 isse yah spasht hota he ki bahya taur par to abhijan varg siddhanth loktantr ke vichaar ko adhik vyavahaaravaadi or anubhavik banane kaa daawa karti he, lekin antat yah loktantr ko ek aise roodhiwaadee raajnneetik siddhanth main badal detaa he jo udaaravaadi athwa nav-udaaravaadi yathasthitwaad se santusht ho jaataa he or iske sthayitv ko banaae rakhana chahta he
 Eliteracy has been criticized by many thinkers, including C
B
 mcpherson, Graeme Duncan, Barry Holden, Robert Dal etc
 are prominent
 is siddhanth ke viruddh mukhya aapattiyaan nimnlikhit hai: The pluralistic principle of democracy also emphasizes the role of groups instead of the common people
 kuch vichaarkon ne loktantr sambandhi aise siddhanton kaa nirupan kiya he jo abhijan siddhanth or bahulwaadi siddhanth kaa mishran he
 But it is also true that the pluralistic theory has its origins as a partial reaction to the elitist theory
 abhijan siddhanth ek aisi sthiti ke nirmaan se santusht he jisamen satta aise abhijanvarg main nihit hoti he jo mahatvapurn nirnay letaa he, lekin bahulwaadi ek aisi pranali par jor detaa he jo udaaravaadi loktantr main abhijanwaad kii pravriti ko nishprabhavi kar degaa or sahi janaakanksha ko prakat karegaa
 While the concept of pluralism is old, it became an important part of modern liberal thinking in the twentieth century
 saamaanya arth main bahulwaad satta ko samaaj main ek chote se samooh tak simit karne ke badale use prasaarit or vikendrikrut kar detaa he
 In modern industrial and technological times, according to pluralists, power has fragmented and the participation of competing public and private groups has increased
 ucch sthanon par asin logon ke paas purv kii bhaanti satta nahin rah gai he, kyonki ve mukhya rup se paraspar virdohi swaarthon ke bich madhyasth kii bhoomika nibhaane lage
 Different groups mediate through their leadership and through this the individual is also represented
 yadhyapi audyogic or praudyogic ekikaran or praudyogic abhiyaachanaon ke kaaran satta kuch hi vyaktiyon main kendrit ho gai he lekin alpsankhyak kintu vrihattar, hit-samoohon ke bich pratiyogita saarvajanik hit ke paksh main jaati he
 Competition between the big business houses, labor and government has kept each group abusing its power
 is prakaar, nagarikon ke bich sampatti, shiksha or satta main asamanta ko nimna prabhavit kar diya jaataa he kyonki sanghathan or samooh aashaa se adhik pratinidhitiv pradaan karte he or isse loktantr adhik vaastavik banataa he or is arth main adhik vyavhaarya bhi siddh hota he
 Take the example of India
 yahaan mahendra singh tikait kaa kisaan sanghathan or narmada bachaao aandolan aise jan aandolan hai jo lakhon garib or ashikshit logon kii awaz ban jate hai
 And definitely make democracy more real
 yah sahi he ki abhijanvarg or unke samachar media unki aalochana karte hai or unhen pragati kaa baadhak bataate hai or yada kada sarvocch nyaayalay bhi unhen apane aandolanon ko roak dene ke liye baadhya karata he, kintu is sab ke baavjood aise janandolan bhartiya loktantr ko adhik sarthak or pratinidhimulak banaate hai
 The pluralistic concept of democracy developed mainly in America
 iske pranetaon main es
 em
 linset, robert daal, ve
 presnts, epa
 hunter aadi pramukh hai
 He argues that political power is not as simple as it appears, it is divided between the elite groups including various groups, organizations, classes and associations which usually provide leadership to society
 vibhinn swaarth samooh apni maangon ko sidhe taur par to prastut karte hi hai, vibhinn raajnneetik dalon ke madhyam se bhi pesh karte hai
 a definition of pluralistic democracy is given as follows
 yah ek aisi raajnneetik pranali he jisamen nitiyaan vibhinn samoohon ke bich parsparik paraamarsh or vichaaron ke aadan pradaan ke dwaara nirdhaarit kii jaati he kyonki koi bhi samooh yaa abhijanvarg itnaa shashakt nahi he ki vah akele sarkaar par itnaa dabaab daal sake ki vah uski sari maangon ko puraa kar sake
 The pluralists approve of this partnership of power that it benefits that no social group can dominate the policy-making process of the government so that it can ignore the interests of other classes
 lekin, bahulwaadi siddhantakaaron kii ek manyata yah bhi thi ki sabhi nagarikon ko raajnneetik kshetra main apane hiton ko sanghatit karne or unhen saadhane ke liye vaidhanik avasar or aarthik sansaadhan praapt hai
 Without this opportunity, citizens cannot support or oppose any proposed move
 bahulwaadi vichaarak raajnneeti ko vyaktiyon ke badale samoohon ke bich nishchayon kii prakriya maanate hai or ghoshnaa karte hai ki loktantr sarvottam tareeke se tabhi kaam karata he jab naagarik apane vishesh hiton ke samarthak samooh se jud jate hai
 They emphasize that there should be active participation of individuals in a society and join different groups to implement their resolve
 saath hi, saare samoohon or unke sadasyon ko yah sweekaar karnaa chahie ki chunaav raajnneetik nirnyon main vishaal samudaay kii sahabhaagita kaa ek kargar hathiyaar he
 Similarly, all groups and members of the elite class make democracy possible through mutual competition
 isse spasht he ki bahulwaadi siddhanth vastav main abhijanwaad kaa purnatah virodh nahin karata kyonki iske pravartakon ke anusaar abhijanvarg kaa astitv ek hakeekat he or ve uski avasthiti se santusht he
 This is the reason that pluralistic theories are sometimes considered to be only partially different from elite principles
 mahaan america raajnneetik vichaarak robert daal loktantr kii abhijanvaadee or bahulwaadi abhidharanaon ko sanyukt karte hue apni loktantric abhidharana ko bahutantr kii sangya detaa he
 According to him, the public is active through both groups and politicians of the elite
 usne anek aise samudaayon kaa hawala diya he jo sarkaar ke niti-nirdhaaran ko prabhavit karte hai- jaise, vyapaaree gharaane or udyogpati, saudagar, shramik sanghathan, kisaan sanghathan, upabhokta, matadaata ityadi
 It is not that their entire agenda is implemented
 saare samooh samaan rup se shashakt nahin hote or anek samooh apni manonukoolnitiyon ko manwaane kii apeksha pratikulanitiyon kii rokthaam main zyada prabhavi hote hai
 Among the objections raised against the pluralist doctrine are the following: raajnneeti kriyalap main sahabhaagita loktantr kaa mul tatva he, lekin khaskar poonjivadi loktantron main yah praayah chunaavon main matdaan tak hi simit rahata he
 The participatory principle of democracy considers augmented participation as an ideal as well as a practical necessity
 is siddhanth ke pramukh prastaavkon main 1960 ke dashak se carol perlman, si
 bi
 macmmersan or en
 polant jaas jaise vampanthi vichaarak pramukh rahe hai
 Following are the two salient features of participatory democracy: sahabhaagi loktantr ke siddhantakaaron ke anusaar yadi nitigat nirnay lene kaa jimmaa keval abhijan varg tak simit rahata he to uske loktantr kaa vaastavik swaroop baadhit hota he
 Therefore, they advocate common man's participation in it
 unka maananaa he ki yadi loktantric adhikaar kaagaj ke pannon athwa samvidhan ke anuchhedon tak hi simit rahe to un adhikaron kaa koi arth nahin rah jaataa, atah saamaanya logon dwaara un adhikaron kaa vaastavik upbhog kiya janaa aavashyak he
 But this consumption is also possible only when the person is independent and equal
 yadi logon kaa vishwaas ho ki nitigat nirnyon main kargar sahabhaagita ke avasar vastav main vidyaman na hai to ve nishchay hi sahabhaagi banenge
 In such a situation, they will also be able to partner effectively
 jis loktantr main, chaahe vah raajnneetik ho yaa pravidhik yaa shilpatantric abhijanvarg kaa varchasv hota he vah nagarikon ke liye santoshprad nahi hota or amlog sahabhaagita ke dwaara hi us varg ke varchasv ko samaapt kar sakate hai
 Proponents of participatory theory also state that in today's industrial and technological societies, the standard of education has been elevated and the gap between elite and non-elite has reduced in a society rich in intellectual and political consciousness
 isliye kaaryakshmata or vikaas kii drushti se adhikansh maamalon main saamaanya logon kii sahabhaagita koi baadha nahin rah gai he
 Frankly speaking, the denuclearization of power is the strongest defense against tyranny
 sahabhaagita par aadhaarit loktantr hi nagarikon ko tatasthta, agyaan or algaav se bachaa saktaa he or loktantr kii buniyadi jaruraton ko puraa kar saktaa he
 The question is, how should the political participation of the common citizen? Its theorists have given the following ways: macmmersan kii tippanee he ki aaj ke raashtra kshetra or jansankhya kii drushti se vishalkay hai or yah sambhav nahin he ki saare naagarik rosemare ke raajnneetik vimarsh yaa niti nirdhaaran main shaamil hon, phir bhi yadi kuch sharto ko sweekaar kar liya jaae to sahabhaagita kaa anupaat nishchit rup se badhaayaa ja saktaa ha
 These conditions are: david held ne sahabhaagita siddhanth par aapatti uthaate hue kaha ki yah puraatan / abhijan bahulwaadi jaise siddhanton se behatar to he, lekin isse yah spasht nahin ho paata ki kaise or kyon sirf sahabhaagita maanviya vikaas, jo loktantr kaa ek mahatvapurn lakshya he, ke ucchtar str ko praapt kar sakegi
 There is no evidence or rational basis that participation will make citizens more cooperative and committed to the common interest
 held is kendriya manyata ko bhi aavashyak rup se satya nahin maanata ki aam log apane jivan ko prabhavit karne vaale muddon par niti nirdhaaran karne or nirnay lene main adhik uttaradaayi bananaa chaahate hai
 If they do not want to participate in the determination of socio-economic matters and policies, then it cannot be considered appropriate to force them
 phir bhi maan liya jaae ki aam log apane loktantric rujhaan ko yadi ek seemaa se aage le janaa chahen or buniyadi swatantraaa or adhikaar ke maamle main dakhlandaji karne lage to loktantr kaa kya hashr hoga, aise prashnon par sahabhaagita siddhanth ke samarthakon ne paryaapt dhyaan nahin diya he
 According to Cook and Morgan, the realization of participatory democracy is not as easy as it seems on the top
 udaahranarth, sahabhaagi ikai ke samyak aakaar or krity kya hon phir, nagarikon kii sakriy sahabhaagita ke bal par sthaneey staron par liye gaye nirnyon ko sampurna raashtra ke hit ke saath kis prakaar samanvit evam samekit kiya jayega? ek sthaneey sahabhaagi ikai ke nitigat maamle duusari ikai ke virdohi bhi to ho sakate hai
 Then there is one thing that decisions taken on the basis of maximum possible participation are not necessarily the most effective decisions
 sahabhaagita siddhanth ke samarthak kaaryakshmata evam prabhaav ke muddon par paryaapt dhyaan nahin dete
 Contrary to popular belief, the idea of democracy has also been accepted by Marx and later Marxist thinkers
 itnaa avashya he ki unki loktantr-sambadhi abhidharana paashchaatya udaaravaadi loktantric abhidharanaon se purnatah bhinn he
 Since the Marxists believe that the democratic right in the capitalist system is not in the true sense, but only in the hands of the resource-rich class, they want to establish a democracy that is 'public democracy'
 marxvaadi loktantr main utpaadan ke sadhano par swaamitv ko khatm karne or sarvharavarg dwaara arthvyavastha ko niyantrit karne ke pashchaat samaajawaadee loktantr kii sthapana hoti he
 Marx was a critic of liberal constitutional democracy because according to him the basis of capitalist democracy is an economic system in which the means of production are always under the control of the capitalist class
 yahi puunjipati varg apni dhan-shakti ke bal par raajnneetik vyavastha kii niyantran main rakhkar sarkaar or rajya-tantra ko apane adheen rakhata he
 State power, rights and privileges rest solely with the same class and the working class only has the freedom and rights of name
 rajya kaa adhikari varg, nyaayalay or police bal bhi tatasth na hokar prabhutasampann varg ke hi hit sadhak hote hai
 Therefore, democracy takes the form of a system of governance which is used to promote the power and privilege of the ruling class and to serve the interests of the upper class
 iske baavjood, marks or angels ne yah sweekaar kiya he ki sampann puunjipati varg dwara niyantrit udaaravaadi burjua loktantr bhi kisi had tak apane nagarikon ko vaastavik adhikaar dene ke aitihaasik daawey kar saktaa he or shramik varg iskaa istemaal apane ko sangathit kar sarvhaara kii kranti ke liye kar sakate hai
 In liberal democracies, the common franchise can be used to set the background of the revolutionary movement of the proletariat
 marxvaadi yah avashya maanate hai ki kuch sthitiyon main hinsak krantikari aandolan kii aavashyaktaa nahin ho sakati he lekin aisi sthitiyon kii sambhaavna atyalp he
 Even if the parliamentary route is adopted to meet the goal of socialist revolution, it can only be an additional tool in other types of conflicts
 marxvaadi vishleshan ke anusaar vaastavik loktantr sarvhaara ke adhinayakawad ko kaayam karne ke liye sarvharavarg kii kranti ke pashchaat hi sambhav he kyonki udaaravaadi bujuar loktantr kaa adarsh pratibhagita kaa ho saktaa he, lekin yatharth main saadhanheen shramik varg kii sahabhaagita usamen nahin ho paati
 In his work The Critique of the Gotha Program, Marx and Engels wrote in a clear explanation of their concept: 'between capitalist and communist societies lies the period of conversion of one into the other
 isi se mail khaati ek raajnneetik sankraman kii avadhi bhi hoti he jisamen rajya sarvhaara varg ke adhinayakawad or samyawad main bhed kiya he
 They consider it an intermediate period
 isaki parinti samyavaadee samaaj kii sthapana main hoti he
 It is important to understand in what sense Karl Marx and Engels used the term totalitarianism
 unki drushti main prayek rajya shaasha saamaajik varg kaa adhinayakawad rahaa he
 In the capitalist system, this class belonged to the thriving industrial and merchant bourgeoisie, while the state with its own concept would be a state controlled by the proletariat immediately after the revolution and then the process of socialist reconstruction would begin which would end in the establishment of a classless society
 isliye, unki drushti main loktantr or sarvhaara adhinayakawad ek hi saath chalenge, thik vaise hi jaise ki poonjivadi vyavastha main udaaravaadi loktantr vyavharytah loktantr bhi or udyogpatiyon evam vyapaarik gharaanon ke burjua varg kaa adhinayakawadi shaasha bhi
 Therefore, Marx and Engels said that the system after the revolution and the hegemony of the working class would be the system of 'people's democracy'
 janata se unka taatpary muththibhar sampann burjua ke sthaan par jansamanya kii vishaal aabaadi se tha
 The following are the salient features of 'people's democracy' as propounded by Marx: samaajawaadee samaajon kii rachana ne marxvaadi vichaaron ko or aage badhaayaa, lenin jisane rus main 1917 main pratham samaajawaadee rajya kii sthapana kii ne marxvaadi chintan kii nai vyakhyaayein prastut kii
 He accepted the totalitarianism of the proletariat and emphasized its importance of socialist revolution, but he also added with it that the totalitarianism of the proletariat can be exercised only by a large proletarian organization or communist party
 usne loktantr kii teen avasthaaen bataaiah poonjivadi loktantr, samaajawaadee loktantr or samyavaadee loktantr
 According to him, democracy is a form of state and in a class-divided society, the government is both totalitarian and democratic
 yah ek varg ke liye loktantr he to duusare ke liye adhinayakawad
 Since the bourgeoisie controls and operates the capitalist system in its own interest, it is necessary to establish socialist democracy by evicting it from power
 lenin sweekaar karata he ki nav sthapit samaajawaadee rajya utana hi damanaatmak hota he jitna ki poonjivadi rajya
 It is also necessary to implement the rule of the proletariat
 chunki burjua kaaphi shaktishaalee hota he, isliye samaajawaadee loktantr ke aarambhik daur main sarvhaara varg ke liye aavashyak ho jaataa he ki vah balpurvak poonjivadi varg kaa unmoolan kar de
 The dictatorship of the proletariat has two goals: lenin ke anusaar yah kaary mukhya rup se samyavaadee dal ko karnaa padataa he
 Thus, in Lenin's view, capitalist democracy does not have true democracy, whereas proletarian authoritarianism has more secular democracy, as it is the rule of the majority proletariat
 uskaa yah bhi daawa tha ki antatah sachche samyawad kii prapti ke saath loktantr anaavashyak ho jayega, kyonki us samaaj ke sandarbh main iskaa koi arth nahin rah jayega
 After Marx, Engels and Lenin, many thinkers have presented many interpretations of Marxism
 inamen edward bernstin, karl kotski, rojaa lukjamvarg aadi pramukh hai
 Edward Bernstein claims that Marxist interpretation of capitalism is wrong and totalitarianism of the proletariat is neither necessary nor desirable
 uske anusaar, raajnneetik loktantr or udaaravaadi swatantraaaen adhik mahatvapurn he
 Lenin does not believe that authoritarianism of the proletariat is necessary
 bernstin kaa tark he ki jab tak sarvhaara varg bahumat hasil nahin kar letaa, samaajawaadee kranti asambhav he or yadi vah bahumat hasil kar letaa he to adhinayakawad kii jarurat hi nahin rahati
 According to him, democracy is necessary and socialism can be established only by combining democratic tradition with Marxist socialist theory
 marxvaadi krantikari rojaa lakjamberg ne lenin kii loktantr- virdohi niti ke sambandh main aapatti uthaate hue kaha he ki isse vishaal janasamudaay kaa adhinayakawad nahin, vishaal janasamudaay par adhinayakawad sthapit ho jaataa he
 • The majority of the population, which is the purveyor of the non-elite, is largely non-committal, lazy and indifferent, so it is necessary to have a minority that provides leadership
 • abhijan siddhanth ke anusaar aaj ke jatil samaaj main kaaryakshmata ke liye visheshgyata aavashyak he or visheshgyon kii sankhya hameshaa kam hi hoti he
 Therefore, political leadership must be in the hands of such selectively competent people

 • According to the proponents of participatory theory, democracy is the real meaning of equal participation of every individual, not merely to keep the government stable as the elitist or pluralist ideologues assume
 sachche loktantr kaa nirmaan tabhi ho saktaa he jab naagarik raajnneetik drushti se sakriy hon or samuhik samasyaon main nirantar abhiruchi lete rahen
 Active participation is necessary so that the major institutions of society have adequate exchange and political parties have more openness and sense of responsibility

 Therefore, they advocate common man's participation in it

 • Democracy is a form of state and government is both totalitarian and democratic in a class-divided society
 yah ek varg ke liye loktantr he to duusare ke liye adhinayakawad
 Since the bourgeoisie controls and operates the capitalist system in its own interest, it is necessary to establish socialist democracy by evicting it from power

 The use of ultraviolet rays is very effective in solving criminal incidents
 Many objects produce glare or visible light after exposure to UV rays

 Durud Sharif or Salwat or as-salatu alan-nabi is a special Arabic phrase, in which salutation is sent to the last Prophet of Islam, Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam and Ahl al-bait
 While mentioning Prophet Muhammad, Durud Sharif is uplifted by Muslim people
 Numerically, the number of Durud Sharif is in thousands or millions, but the original meaning of each Durud Sharif is to seek blessings and blessings from Muhammad Allaah for Muhammad and his family

 hindu devvaad par vaidic, puranic, tantric or lokdharm kaa prabhaav he
 In Vedic religion one can imagine the tangible form of the deities
 vaidic manyata ke anusaar devtaa ke rup main mulshakti sristi ke vividh upaadaanon main samprukt rahati he
 The same consciousness is in all the ingredients
 yahi chetana yaa agni anek sfurlingon kii tarah ek hi paramatma kii vibhutiyaan hai
 
 vaidic devataaon kaa vargeekaran teen kotiyon main kiya gaya he - prithvisthaneey, antarikshasthaneey or dyusthaneey
 Agni, Vayu and Surya represent these three categories respectively
 inhen tridevon ke aadhaar par pehle 33 or baad ko 33 koti devataaon kii pariklpana kii gai he
 33 There is a big difference in the name and form of the gods from the texts
 ‘shatapath brahman’ main 33 devataaon kii suchi apekshaakrit bhinn he jinamein 8 vasuon, 11 rudron, 12 adityon ke sivaa akaash or prithvi ginaae gaye hai
 The imagination of more than 33 deities is also very oriental
 rugveda ke do mantron main 3339 devataaon kaa ullekh he
 Thus although Vedic Devism was originally based on monotheism, it was later differentiated by special qualitative nouns in such a way that they gradually assumed independent characterization
 unka swaroop charitra main shuddh prakritik upadanatmak na rahakar dhire dhire lok aasthaa, manyata or parampara kaa aadhaar lekar maanvi athwa atimanvi ho gaya
 In the post-vedic period, mythological tantric literature and religion and folk religion had such an impact on Vedic Devism that the Vedic gods, after leaving their form and virtues in the later period, were established in a different form in Lokmanas itself
 parvarti kaal main bahut se vaidic devtaa gaun pad ko praapt hue tathaa nae devswaroopon kii kalpanaayen bhi hui
 With this situation, the nature and importance of Indian Devism became more widespread
 hindu dharm main koi bhi upaask apni ruchi ke anusaar apane devtaa ke chunaav ke liye swatantra tha
 However, it was also stated in the scriptures that the deity can be worshiped according to work and purpose
 is prakaar nripon ke devtaa vishnu or indra, brahmanon ke devtaa agni, surya, brahma, shiv nirdhaarit kiye gaye he
 According to another arrangement, of Vishnu gods, of Rudra Brahmins, of Moon or Soma Yakshas and Gandharvas, of Saraswati Vidyadharas, of Hari Sadhya sects, of Parvati eunuchs, of Brahma and Mahadev sages, Surya, Vishnu and Uma Manu, Brahma Brahmacharis K, Ambika Vaikhanasans, Shiva Yatis, Ganapati or Ganesha are the special deities of Kushmands or Ganas
 kintu samaanya grihasthon ke liye is prakaar kaa bhedbhaav nahin lakshith he
 All gods are worshiped for him
 hindu devpariwaar kaa udbhav brahma se mana jaataa he
 Brahma is the first in the trinity
 bhartiya dharna ke anusaar brahma hi strashta hai or ve hi prajapati hai
 He is one and his wish that i become enough is the reason for the prosperity of the world
 mandu upanishad main brahma ko devataaon main pratham, vishwa kaa karta or sangrakshak kaha gaya he
 The introduction of Brahma in Vedic literature as the doer is given by various names, such as Vishwakarmana, Brahmasvati, Hiranyagarbha, Prajapati, Brahma and Brahma
 puraanon main in naamon ke atirikt dhaataa, vidhaataa, pitamah aadi bhi prachlit hue
 The importance of Brahma in mythological literature is secondary to Vedic literature
 upasna kii drushti se jo mahatta vishnu, shiv, yahan tak kii ganpati or surya ko praapt he, vah bhi brahma ko nahin mila, kintu vaidic devataaon main prajapati ke rup main brahma sarvamaanya hai or is rup main ve akaash or prithvi ko sthapit karne vaale tathaa antariksh main vyaapt rahete hai
 They keep the whole world and all beings in their arms
 is prakaar rugveda main brahma kaa amoort rup hi atharv maanya he
 His imagination in human form is also very ancient
 atharv or bajasaneyi samhita main bhi ve sarvopari devtaa ke rup main sweekaar kiye gaye hai
 In the Shatapatha Brahmin, he is said to be the father of the gods and elsewhere in the same scripture that Brahma existed in the beginning of the universe
 maitrayani samhita main prajapati ke apni putree ushas par aasakt hone kii katha milti he jo parvarti sahitya main vistrut rup se duharai gai he
 The belief of Brahma in the latter society declined due to the moral attitude towards this story
 brahma kaa swabhaav bhi unki lokapriyata main baadhak hua
 He did not become popular as Vishnu and Shiva as a cult deity and could not be a special character of devotion due to the special advocacy of tapas and yajna
 saath hin vishnu or shiv kaa virodh karanevaale asur or devon par bhi ve sahaj hi anukanpa karte the atev donon hi sampradaywaalon ne inaki upeksha kii he
 Brahma gradually becomes so insignificant in Hindu mythology that as Madhu Katabha's story shows, he is unable to protect himself and expects Vishnu's grace
 vaishnav or shaiva donon hi sampradaywale apane aradhy dev vishnu or shiv ko brahma kaa aradhy dev maanate hai
 This type of approach had an impact on the Indian religion that neither a religious sect could stand in India on the basis of that deity, nor separate idols of Brahma were established in abundance as a worshiper
