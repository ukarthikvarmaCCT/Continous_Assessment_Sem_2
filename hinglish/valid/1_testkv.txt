 There is no complete consensus on how many continents are there on Earth
 kuch log chaar yaa paanch mahadweep swikarte he par adhiktar log chah, yaa saat mahadweep ke hone kaa mat rakhte hai
 There are mainly two differences among geologists
 pehla to ye ki kya europe or asia ko alag-alag mahadweep maane yaa in donon ko jodakar ek mahadweep uresia maane
 doosraa, kya uttar america or dakshin america ko alag-alag mahadweep maane yaa inhe saath milakar ek america mahadweep maane

 According to Durga Saptashati and Goddess Mahatyamay, there was a hundred years of war between the gods and the Asuras in which the Asuras won
 asuro kaa raja mahisasur swarg kaa raja ban gaya or devtaa saamaanya manushyon ki bhaanti dharti par vichran karne lage
 The gods were greatly tortured by the Asuras
 devataaon ne is vishay par aapas main vichaar kiya or is ksht ke nivaaran ke liye vah bhagwaan vishnu ke paas gayi
 Lord Vishnu asked him to worship the goddess
 tab devataaon ne unase poocha ki wo koun devi hai jo hamaare kashto kaa nivaaran karengi
 As a result of this plan, a divine light appeared from inside the three trinity, Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh, which was transformed into a woman on sight
 is devi ko sabhi devi-devataaon ne kuch-na-kuch bhet swaroop pradaan kiya

 Khurd and Kalan are Persian language words found in many contexts in Hindi and in the Indian subcontinent, especially in place names
 "kurd" kaa matlab "chota" hota he or "kalaan" kaa matlab bada hota he
 These names have been used since Mughal times
 choti aabaadi vaale gaanvon-kasbon ke peeche khurd shabd lagaaya gaya
 This Persian word means small
 yah khurd sanskrit ke kshudra se hi bana he jisamen laghu, chota yaa sookshmata kaa bhav he
 There are thousands of Khurd dhari villages across the country
 isi tarah kai gaanvon ke saath kalam shabd judaa miltaa he jaise kosi kalam, baamaniyaan kalam 
 Just as the word khurd became synonymous with small or small, similarly the word kalan became synonymous with big or huge
 kalam kaa prayog lagbhag usee arth main hota tha jaise bharat ke liye prachinkaal main brihattar bharat shabd kaa prayog hota tha jisamen burma se lekar iran tak kaa samoochaa bhushetra aata tha
 However, a word like Hindustan Kalan is not found in any travelogue
 greater britain kii baat chalati thi to uske upniveshon kaa sandarbh nihit hota tha
 Similarly, the meaning of the word Kalan is also important in the context of rural populations
 kalam multah farsi kaa shabd he jiskaa matlab hota he varisht, bada, deergh yaa vishaal
 However, its etymology is unknown
 kuch sandarbhon main ise semetic bhashaa parivaar kaa bataaya jaataa he or ise ishwar kii mahanata se joda jaataa he
 This is fine on the basis of Kalan's economy, but it is not confirmed by any Semitic metal
 kalam shabd kaa prayog sirf sthanon kaa rutaba bataane ke liye hi nahin hota tha balki vyaktiyon ke naam bhi hote the jaise mirza kalam yaa amir kalam al bukhari jiskaa matlab bukhaara kaa mahaan amir hota he
 Obviously, the word Kalan means great here
 muslim shasankaal main basaahaton ke namakaran kii mahima yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 The names of many villages are associated with the word elders such as Sonpipri elders
 jaahir he hamanaam gaanv se fark karne ke liye ek basaahat ko varisht maanate hue uske aage bujurg laga diya gaya or doosraa hua sonpipari khurd 
 Many such rural settlements number in the thousands
 isi tarah kisi gaanv ke vishisht darje ko dekhte hue uske saath jaagir shabd laga diya jaataa tha
 This means that from the annual revenue collection, the part of that village will not go into the government treasury or it will get partial exemption
 mughalon ke daur main prabhavi vyaktiyon ko athwa puraskaar swaroop saamaanya varg ke logo ko bhi gaanv jaagir main diye jate the
 But to distinguish it from other villages of the same name, the newly created vassals used to add jagirs to them like Hinautia and Hinautia Jagir
 uttar bharat, pakistan or afghanistan main kai aise gaanv, shahar or mohalle hai jo ek jagah shuru hue or phir falkar unke do hisse ho gaye - ek mukhya yaa bada hissaa or ek chota hissaa
 In this case, "kalan" came to be called behind the name of the big part and "khurd" behind the small part
 iske is kshetra main hazaron udahaaran hai - Sometimes two villages and hamlets are different, but by and large they meet and become one
 aise main is kshetra main rivaaj he ke yah baat spasht kii jaae ke kurd or kalaan donon kii baat ho rahi he or unhen "kurd kalam kaha jaataa he - These two words are also used in some other contexts - tata yodogava jamshedpur sthit ek company he

 Bahadur Shah Zafar was the last emperor of the Mughal Empire in India and a noted poet of Urdu
 unhone 1857 kaa pratham bhartiya swatantraaa sangram main bhartiya sipaahiyon kaa netritv kiya
 After the defeat in the war, the British sent him to Burma where he died
 jafar kaa janm 24 aktubar, 1775 main hua tha
 His father was Akbar Shah II and mother Lalbai
 apane pita kii mrityu ke baad jafar ko 18 sitambar, 1837 main mughal badshaah banaaya gaya
 It was a matter of fact that by that time the Sultanate of Delhi had become very weak and the Mughal emperor had remained a nominal emperor
 bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane kii jafar ko baari keemat bhi chukaani padi thi
 His sons and great-grandchildren were publicly roasted by the British authorities
 yahi nahin, unhen bandi banaakar rangoon le jaaya gaya, jahaan unhone saat november, 1862 main ek bandi ke rup main dam todaa
 He was buried near the Shvedagon Pagoda in Rangoon
 unke dafan sthal ko ab bahadur shah jafar dargah ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Even today, when a patriotic person travels to the then Burma, he does not forget to pay tribute to Zafar's tomb
 logon ke dil main unke liye kitna sammaan tha uskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki hindustan main jahaan kai jagah sadakon kaa naam unke naam par rakhaa gaya he, vahiin pakistan ke lahore shahar main bhi unke naam par ek sadak kaa naam rakhaa gaya he
 Victoria Park in Old Dhaka city of Bangladesh has been renamed Bahadur Shah Zafar Park
 1857 main jab hindustan kii aazaadee kii chingaari bhadki to sabhi vidrohi sainikon or raja-maharaajaaon ne unhen hindustan kaa samraat mana or unke netritv main angrejon kii eent se eent baja di
 Bahadur Shah Zafar also got angry after seeing the rebellion of Indian soldiers against the British and called for the British to be driven out of India
 bharatiyon ne dilli or desh ke anya hisson main angrejon ko kadi shikast di
 Initial results favored the Indian warriors, but later, due to the deception of the British, the stand of the first freedom struggle changed and the British managed to suppress the rebellion
 bahadur shah jafar ne humayun ke makbare main sharan lee, lekin major hads ne unhen unke bete mirza mughal or khijar sultan va pote abu bakar ke saath pakad liya
 The British crossed all limits of oppression
 jab bahadur shah jafar ko bhukh lagi to angrej unke saamne thali main paroskar unke beton ke sir le aae
 He replied to the British that the sons of India sacrifice their heads for the country and come to their father in the same manner
 aazaadee ke liye hui baghawat ko puri tarah khatm karne ke makasad se angrejon ne antim mughal badshaah ko desh se nirvasit kar rangoon bhej diya
 Bahadur Shah Zafar was not only a patriotic Mughal emperor but also a famous Urdu poet
 unhone bahut si mashhoor urdu kavitaayen likhin, jinamein se kaaphi angrejon ke khilaaf baghawat ke samay machi uthal-puthal ke dauraan kho gai yaa nasht ho gai
 The lines written by him in Urdu are also very famous - ,,, Ek aisa ghar chahiye mujh Ko jiski faza mastana Ho Ek kone mein ghazal ki mahfil Ek kone mein maykhana Ho
 ,,, desh se baahar rangoon main bhi unki urdu kavitaaon kaa jalawaa jari rahaa
 He was always worried about India there
 unki antim ichha thi ki vah apane jivan kii antim saans hindustan main hi len or vahiin unhen dafnaaya jaae lekin aisa nahin ho paaya
 i do not think that my desolation is in love, what is made of alam-e-naapidar bulbul ko bagbaan se na saiyaad se gilaa,kismat main kaid likhi thi fasal-e-bahaar main
 Tell them to settle somewhere else from these haunts, where is this place in dil-e-daagdar
 ek shaakh gul pe baith ke bulbul he shaadamaan,kaante bicha die hai dil-e-laal-e-zaar main
 Age-a-drawer had brought four days of demand, two were cut in the beginning, two were waiting
 din zindagi khatm hue shaam ho gai,failaa ke paanv soyenge kunj-e-mazaar main
 How much is it for unfortunate 'zafar' dafn, two gaz zameen not found in ku-e-yaar bahadur shah jafar jaise kam hi shaasha hote hai jo apane desh ko mahabuuba kii tarah mohabbat karte hai or ku-e-yaar main jagah na mil paane kii kasak ke saath pardes main dam tod dete hai
 This was the basic difference with the fundamental Indian ideology which considers its country as its mother
 badshaah jafar ne jab rangoon main karawas ke dauraan apni aakhri saans lee to shaayad unke labon par apni hi mashhoor ghazal kaa yah sher jarur rahaa hoga- "kitna he badanaseeb jafar dafn ke liye, do gaj jameen bhi na mili ku-e-yaar main
 " bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane vaale antim mughal badshaah bahadur shah jafar urdu ke ek bade shaayar ke rup main bhi vikhyath hai
 His poetry was filled with patriotism rather than sentimental poets and this was the reason that he warned the British rulers to walk to Shamsheer of Hindustan till the planks-london
 janashrutiyon ke anusaar pratham swatantraaa sangram ke baad jab badshaah jafar ko giraftaar kiya gaya to urdu jaanane vaale ek angrej sainya adhikari ne un par kataaksh karte hue yah sher kaha- "dam main dam nahin, ab khayr maango jaan kii e jafar ab myaan ho chuki he, shamsheer hindustan kii

!!" is par jafar ne karaara jawaab dete hue kaha tha- "hindio main bu rahegi jab talak imaan kii, takhte landan tak chalegi teg hindustan kii

!!" Zafar, called the last emperor of the Mughal period in India, was made the emperor of Delhi during the First War of Independence
 badshaah banate hi unhone jo chand aadesh die, unamem se ek tha gohatya par roak lagaana
 This order shows how big he was for hindu-muslim unity
 gorakhpur vishvavidhyalay main itihaas ke purv praadhyaapak dow shailanath chaturvedi ke anusaar 1857 ke samay bahadur shah jafar ek aisi badi hasti the, jinka badshaah ke taur par hi nahin ek dharmanirpeksh vyakti ke rup main bhi sabhi sammaan karte the
 That is why it was very natural that the soldiers who reached Delhi after revolting from Meerut made Bahadur Shah Zafar their king first
 chaturvedi ne baatcheet main kaha ki jafar ko badshaah bananaa sankethik rup se british shaskaon ko ek sandesh tha
 Under this, the Indian soldiers wanted to give the message that the Indian ruler would be in power at the center of India, not foreign
 badshaah banane ke baad bahadur shah jafar ne gohatya par pabandi kaa jo aadesh diya tha vah koi nayaa aadesh nahin tha
 Rather, Akbar had given similar orders during his reign
 jafar ne mahaj is aadesh kaa paalan phir se karwaanaa shuru kar diya tha
 Another aspect of Zafar's personality was poetry, along with Deshprem
 unhone na keval gaalib, daag, momin or jock jaise urdu ke bade shaayaron ko tamaam tarah se protsaahan diya, balki vah swayan ek achche shaayar the
 According to literary critics, during the time of Zafar, where Mughal power was in decline, Urdu literature especially Urdu poetry was at its height
 jafar kii maut ke baad unki shaayari "kulliyaat e jafar" ke naam se sankalit kii gayi

 sharir kii nirjaleekaran ke prati saamaanya pratikriya yah he ki vah mutr ko sandrit kare tathaa pani ko sangrakshit kare jisase mutr zyada sandrit ho jaati he tathaa mutr utsarjan kam hota he
 Individuals with DI consume significant amounts of urine even after drinking no fluids

 Desmopressin stimulation is also used to differentiate between the main forms; Desmopressin can be taken by injection, a nasal spray, or a pill
 desmoprasin lete samay ek mariz ko taral pinaa chahie or pani tabhi pinaa chahie jab pyaas ho anyathaa nahin, anyathaa kendriya tantrika tantra main achaanak drav jamaa ho saktaa he
 If desmopressin reduces urine output and increases osmolarity, then the pituitary production decreases and the kidney's response becomes normal
 agar DI, vrikk vikruti ke kaaran he, to desmoprasin mutr utpaadan yaa parasaarita ko nahin badalata he
 If central DI is suspected, a magnetic resonance imaging test is necessary, along with testing for other hormones in the pituitary, to determine if a pathological process is affecting pituitary function
 is lakshan vaale zyaadaatar log yaa to purv main sir ke aghat se guzare hote hai yaa kisi agyaat kaaran se unka ADH utpaadan band ho jaataa he
 At all ages, drinking addiction is the leading cause of diabetes insipidus
 jabaki chikitsa sahitya main kai vayask maamle, maansik vikaron ke saath jude rahete hai, atipipasa kii aadat vaale adhikansh rogiyon ko koi anya beemaari nahin hoti he
 This distinction is made during the water damage test, as some level of urine concentration above isosmolar is obtained before the patient is dehydrated
 electrolite or maatra samasthiti ek jatil tantra he jo sharir kii raktchaap kii zaruuraton tathaa mukhya electrolites sodium tathaa potacium kii aavashyaktaaon ko santulit karata he
 en general; Electrolyte regulation precedes volume regulation
 jab maatra bilkul samaapt ho jaati he, tathaapi sharir electrolite str ko avyavasthit karte hue pani banaae rakhenge
 Regulation of urine production occurs in the hypothalamus, which produces ADH in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei
 sanshleshan ke baad, hormone ko neurosravi kanikagulm main samvaahit kiya jaataa he jo ad:shchetki neuron ke neeche akshatantu se pituitary granthi kii pasch paali main jaataa he jise baad main nishkasit kiye jane ke liye sangrahit kiya jaataa he
 Additionally, the hypothalamus controls the sensation of thirst in the ventromedial nucleus and experiences this increase in serum osmolarity and transmits this information to the cortex
 taral padaarth kii samasthiti ke liye mukhya nishpadi ang gurda he
 ADH acts by increasing water permeability in the collecting ducts and distal convoluted tubules, mainly acting on a protein called aquaporin that opens to send water to the collecting duct cell

 There are several forms of DI: tantrikajanya bahumootrarog, jo saamanytah kendriya bahumootrarog ke naam se gyaat he, mastishk main vaisoprasin ke utpaadan kii kami ke kaaran hota he
 Renal diabetes insipidus is commonly caused by the inability of the kidney to respond to ADH
 pipaasajnya DI, pipaasa tantra main, dosha yaa kshati ke kaaran hota he jo ad:shchetak main sthit he
 This defect results in an abnormal increase in thirst and fluid intake, which decreases ADH secretion and increases urine output
 desmoprasin aprabhavi hoti he or chunki pyaas bani rahati he yah taral adhibhaar ko falit kar sakati he
 Gestational DI occurs only during pregnancy
 jabaki sabhi garbhvatee mahilaayein, garbhanal main vaisopressinez kaa utpaadan karti hai jo ADH ko vikhandit karata he, yah GDI main charam roopon ko dhaaran kar saktaa he
 Most cases of gestational DI can be treated with desmopressin

 Diabetes insipidus is also associated with some serious pregnancy diseases
 ye hai purv-garbhakshep HELLP syndrome, tathaa garbhavastha kaa teevr vasayukta yakrut
 yah, yakrut vaisopresinez ko sakriy karke bahumootrarog kaa kaaran banataa he
 It is necessary to keep these things in mind when a woman has diabetes insipidus in pregnancy, because for the treatment of the disease it is necessary that the baby is born before the disease progresses
 Failure to treat these diseases can promptly lead to perinatal death of women
 kendriya DI or garbhjanya DI, desmoprasin ke prati pratikriya dete hai
 Carbamazepine, an anti-convulsive drug, has also been successful in such DI
 iske alawa garbhjanya DI, prasav pidaa ke 4 se 6 saptaah baad apane-aap hi kam hone lagati he
 Although some women may develop it again during later pregnancies
 pipaasajnya DI main, desmoprasin aamtaur par ek vikalp nahin he
 Desmopressin will be ineffective in nephrogenic DI

 In addition, adequate hydration is important for patients with DI, as they can easily become dehydrated

 Cooker cough or whooping cough or whooping cough is a bacterial infection that initially affects the nose and throat
 yah praayah 2 varsh se kam aayu ke bacchon kii shwasan pranali ko prabhavit karata he
 The disease is named on the basis that the person suffering from this disease makes a barking sound while breathing
 yah bordatella partusia kahalaane vaale jeevanu ke kaaran hota he
 This bacterium is spread among individuals by bacteria expelled by respiration
 yah tab hota he jab sankraman yukt vyakti khansate yaa cheenkte hai
 It also spreads due to contact with bodily fluids of persons with infection such as falling of nasal water

 This cooker cough is for younger age patients whose cough lasts for 2 weeks
 kukur khaansee bacchon main hone vaali ek sankramak tathaa khatarnaak beemaari he
 Mainly affects the respiratory system which is a matter of great concern for both developed and developing countries
 bharat jaise vikasshil desh main prayek ek lakh kii aabaadi par 587 bachche prayek varsh is beemaari se grasit hote hai
 The mortality in children is 4
15 percent, which is 10 percent of the whooping cough, half of the children dying within a year
 yah beemaari bordtal partusis naamak sookshmjivi se hoti he
 Most diseases of the infection occur at the age of five, which is more in female children than in male children
 chah maheene se kam umr ke shishuon main is beemaari se mrityu-dar adhik hoti he, haalanki yah beemaari saal ke kisi bhi maah main ho sakati he, kintu jaada tathaa varsha kii ritu main isaki sambhaavna sarvaadhik hoti he
 Now the question arises that how is this disease transmitted from one child to another? Children suffering from this disease have runny nose, sneeze and cough
 naak bahane ke kram main jo taral padaarth nikalataa he, isi ke dwaara beemaari failati he
 In order to leave the nose, mouth and breath during a cough or sneeze, the bacteria spreads to the surroundings and the environment, which causes infection in other children
 yah beemaari mukhyat: bacchon kii praarambhik avasthaa main, jab unke mata-pita ko unki beemaari kaa pataa nahin chalata, khel ke maidan main, ek bichhaavan par sone or ek hi bartan main khaane-pine ke kram main failati he
 It is not the case that the disease develops soon after the infection of germs

 This sound is due to respiratory tract infection and the opening of the glottis, but that hoop-hoop sound is not always there

 One more thing is that when the cough is showing its gruesome form, then immediately after that it vomits and everyone eats and drinks

 a joint research project measuring the impact of IP systems on the six Asian countries of the WIPO and the United Nations University "found a positive correlation between strengthening the IP system and subsequent economic growth
" " However, correlation does not necessarily mean a work-causal relationship: in a situation when the patent holder has the freedom to settle anywhere, the Nash equilibrium predicts that they would clearly prefer to work in countries where Intellectual property laws should be stringent
 In some cases, the economic growth that comes with a strong IP regime is due to an increase in stock capital from foreign direct investment, as shown in the 1986 reform in Taiwan

 The concept made its first appearance after the French Revolution
 In 1818, the French liberal thinker, Benjamin Constant, presented arguments against the recently presented idea "property, called intellectual", in a collection of his writings
 Intellectual property
 The term was used in October 1845 in the Massachusetts Circuit Court's decision in Davol and others vs
 Brown's case, in which the judge Charles L
 Woodbury wrote that "the only way we can protect intellectual property is the labor, products and interests of the brain, of a person in the same way as the grain produced by him or the cattle that he grows
" 
 The statement that "invention is 


 wealth" is old
 1791 ke francisi kaanoon kii dhara 1 ke anusaar, "sabhi nai khojein lekhak kii smapda hai, avishkaarak kii smapda or uske avishkaar kii use asthaayee anand-prapti sunishchit karne ke liye usko paanch, das yaa pandrah saal ke liye patent diya jayega
" europe main, francisi lekhak e
 neon ne apni 1846 main prakashit Droits civils des auteurs, artistes et inventeurs, main propriété intellectuelle kaa varnan kiya he
 The origins of this concept can possibly be traced back and forth

 "he claims that the term" serves as a means of holding everyone in one place, so that separate laws arising separately, developed differently, having different rules and raising various public policy issues, To be done
 "these critics recommend discussing copyright, patents, and trademarks as one form and cautioning them collectively against esoteric separate law

 The second stage of HIV infection can last from 3 years to 20 years without treatment
 Normally this Charan shows few or no symptoms whereas at the end of this phase many people experience fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle aches
 Swelling or enlargement of the lymph glands is also seen within 3–6 months in about 50–70% of people

 ram kii pratishtha maryaada purushottam ke rup main he
 Rama left the kingdom, friends, parents, even wife to follow decorum

 Ram was born in Raghukul, whose tradition was that of Pran Jahun Baru Bachnu Na Jai
 shriram ke pita dasharath ne unki sauteli mata kaikeyi ko unki kinhin do ichchhaaon ko puraa karne kaa vachan diya tha
 Kaikeyi came under the guise of maid Manthara as these vars asked King Dasaratha for his son Bharata for the throne of Ayodhya and fourteen years of exile for Rama
 pita ke vachan kii raksha ke liye ram ne khushi se chaudaa varsh kaa vanvaas sweekaar kiya
 Wife Sita thought it appropriate to go to the forest with her husband, giving the example of the ideal wife
 bhai lakshmana ne bhi ram ke saath chaudaa varsh van main bitaye
 Bharata rejects Mata's order for justice and goes to the elder brother Rama in the forest and brings him to his feet
 phir ise hi raaj gaddi par rakh kar rajkaaj kiya
 When Ram was a forest dweller, his wife Sita took Ravana away
 jangal main ram ko hanuman jaisaa mitra or bhakt mila jisane ram ke saare kaary puure karaaye
 Rama finds Sita with the help of monkeys
 samudr main pul bana kar lanka pahunche tathaa ravan ke saath yuddh kiya
 After killing him, bring Sita back
 ram ke ayodhya lautne par bharat ne rajya unako hi saunp diya
 Ram was justice-loving
 unhone bahut acha shashan kiya isliye log aaj bhi achche shashan ko raamarajy kii upama dete hai
 His two sons Kush and Love handled their kingdoms
 hindu dharm ke kai tyohaar, jaise dashahra, ram navami or deepawali, ram kii jivan-katha se jude hue hai
 The word 'ram' is derived from the addition of the suffix 'ghan' in 'rum' metal
 'ram' dhaatu kaa arth raman karne se sambaddh he
 They 'raman' in the heart of a creature, therefore 'ram' and devotees 'raman' in them, therefore they are also 'ram'
 'vishnusahasranam' par likhit apane bhashya main aadya shankaracharya ne padmapurana kaa hawala dete hue kaha he ki nityanandswarup bhagavan main yogijan raman karte hai, isliye ve 'ram' hai
 Rama is not mentioned in Vedic literature in the prevailing form
 rugveda main keval do sthalon par hi 'ram' shabd kaa prayog hua he 
 One of them has been used in the meaning of black in one place and the remaining one in the meaning of person; But there is also no indication of his being an avatar man or Dasaratha-son
 yadhyapi nilkanth chaturdhar ne rugveda ke anek mantron ko swavivek se chunakar unke ramakthaparak arth kiye hai, parantu yah unki nijee manyata he
 The Ramakathaparaka meaning of those mantras has not been proved by any indication or any other commentary received in those cases of Rigveda itself
 rugveda main ek sthal par 'ikshvakuh' kaa tathaa ek sthal par 'dasharath' shabd kaa bhi prayog hua he
 But there is no indication of his association with Rama
 brahman sahitya main 'ram' shabd kaa prayog aitarey brahman main do sthalon par hua he; parantu vahaan unhen 'raamo margveyah' kaha gaya he, jiskaa arth acharya sayan ke anusaar 'mrigavu' naamak stri kaa putr he
 The word 'ram' is used at a place in the Shatapatha Brahmin
 yahan 'ram' yajna ke acharya ke rup main he tathaa unhen 'ram auptpasvini' kaha gaya he
 This means that the incarnation of the prevalent Rama is due to the Valmiki Ramayana and the Puranas

 Here only the position of Jupiter and Moon are clear
 brihaspati ucchsth he tathaa chandramaa swagruhi
 Further in the fifteenth verse, the Sun is mentioned to be high
 is prakaar brihaspati tathaa surya ke ucch hone kaa pataa chal jaataa he
 Mercury is always near the Sun
 atah surya ke ucch hone par buddha kaa ucch hona asambhav he
 In this way, the remaining three planets - Mars, Venus and Saturn are left to grow higher
 isi kaaran se praayah sabhi vidwaanon ne ram-janm ke samay main surya, mangal, brihaspati, shukr tathaa shani ko ucch main sthit mana he
 Traditionally, Rama's birth is believed to be in Treta Yuga
 hindu dharamshastron main, visheshtah puranic sahitya main uplabdh aankadon ke anusaar ek chaturyugi main 43,20,000 varsh hote hai, jinamein kaliyug ke 4,32,000 varsh tathaa dwapar ke 8,64,000 varsh hote hai
 Rama was born in Treta Yug i
e
 before Dwapara
 chunki kaliyug kaa abhi prarambh hi hua he or ram kaa janm treta ke ant main hua tathaa avatar lekar dharti par unke vartmaan rahane kaa samay paramparaagat rup se 11,000 varsh mana gaya he
 Hence 8,64,000 years of Dwapara Yuga + 11,000 years of Rama's existence + 5,100 years since the end of Dwapara Yuga = 8,80,100 years in total
 atev paramparaagat rup se ram kaa janm aaj se lagbhag 8,80,100 varsh pehle mana jaataa he
 Eminent Marathi researcher scholar Dr
 Padmakar Vishnu Vartak has considered this time probable from a point of view
 unka kahana he ki valmikiy ramayana main ek sthal par vindhyachal tathaa himalay kii oonchaai ko samaan bataaya gaya he
 The height of Vindhyachal is 5,000 feet and it is almost constant, while the height of the Himalayas is currently 29,029 feet and it is continuously growing
 donon kii oonchaai kaa antar 24,029 feet he
 According to experts, the Himalayas grow 3 feet in 100 years
 atah 24,029 feet badhane main himalay ko kareeb 8,01,000 varsh lage honge
 Hence, the height of the Himalayas must have been similar to that of Vindhyachal, about 8,01,000 years ago, which is mentioned in the present-day form in Valmiki Ramayana
 is tarah da0 vartak ko ek drushti se yah samay sambhav lagata he, parantu unka swayan maananaa he ki ve kisi anya strot se is samay kii pushti nahin kar sakate hai
 In his well-known treatise 'vaastav Ramayana', Dr
 Vartak has done the math on the basis of the planets, according to the planetary position mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana, to determine the actual birth date of Rama on 4 December 7323 BC
 unke anusaar isi tithi ko din main 1:30 se 3:00 baje ke bich ram kaa janm hua hoga
 After several years of research by Dr
 p
v
vartak, a research team of 'i-serve' proved Shri Ram's birth on 10 January 5114 BC using 'planetarium Gold' software
 unka maananaa tha ki is tithi ko grahon kii vahi sthiti thi jiskaa varnan valmikiy ramayana main he
 But this time has become very suspicious
 'ai-sarv' ke shodh dal ne jis 'planetarium gold' software kaa prayog kiya vah vastav main isa purv 3000 se pehle kaa sahi grah-ganit karne main sakasham nahin he
 In fact, before 2013, there was no available software capable of doing so much earlier planetary mathematics
 is gananaa dwaara praapt grah-sthiti main shani vrishchik main tha arthath ucch main nahin tha
 The moon was not in Punarvasu Nakshatra but was in the second phase of Pushya and the date was also Ashtami
 baad main anya visheshgy dwaara ejplde431 software dwaara kii gayi sahi gananaa main tithi to navami ho jaati he parantu shani vrishchik main hi aata he tathaa chandramaa pushya ke chaturth charan main
 Therefore, the date of 10 January 5114 BCE is virtually not proved to be the birth date of Shri Ram
 aisi sthiti main ab yadi dow0 pi0 ve0 vartak dwaara pehle hi parishodhit tithi software dwaara pramanit ho jaae tabhi shriram kaa vaastavik samay praayah sarvamaanya ho paaegaa athwa pramanit na ho paane kii sthiti main naveen tithi ke shodh kaa rasta khulegaa
 There is clear evidence about the birth of Shri Ram in the Puranas that Shri Ram was born in a city called Ayodhya in Faizabad district of present-day Uttar Pradesh
 ayodhya jo ki bhagwaan ram ke purvajon kii hi rajdhani thi
 Raghu was the ancestor of Ramchandra ji
 ram bachapan se hi shant swabhaav ke vir purush the
 He always gave dignity the highest position
 isi kaaran unhen maryaada purushottam ram ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 His kingdom was considered fair and prosperous
 isliye bharat main jab bhi suraaj kii baat hoti he to ramraj yaa raamarajy kaa udhaaharan diya jaataa he
 Rama, who followed the path of religion, received education from Guru Vasistha along with his three brothers
 kishoravastha main guru vishwamitra unhen van main rakshason dwaara machaae ja rahe utpaat ko samaapt karne ke liye saath le gayi
 Rama was accompanied by his younger brother Lakshmana in this task
 tadka naamak rakshasi baxur main rahati thi
 He was killed there
 ram ne us samay tadka naamak rakshasi ko maaraa tathaa marich ko palaayan ke liye majaboor kiya
 During this time, Guru Vishwamitra took him to Mithila
 vahaan ke videh raja janak ne apni putree sita ke vivaah ke liye ek swayamvar samaaroh yojit kiya tha
 Where Lord Shiva had a bow whose Sita was to be married to the knight who donated the emblem
 bahut saare raja maharaja us samaaroh main padhaare the
 When many kings tried to put a bow on the bow even after trying, they could not even lift it, then Rama tried to offer the bow by raising Vishwamitra's command
 unki pratyancha chadhaane ke praytn main vah mahaan dhanush ghor dhwani karte hue tut gaya
 When Maharishi Parashurama heard this loud sound, he came there and started expressing anger at his Guru's bow breaking
 lakshmana ugr swabhaav ke the
 He had a dispute with Parashurama
 tab ram ne bich-bachaav kiya
 Thus Sita was married to Rama and was blessed by all people including Parashurama
 ayodhya main ram sita sukhpurvak rahane lage
 People wanted Rama very much
 unki mridul, janasevayukta bhaavana or nyaaypriyata ke kaaran unki vishesh lokapriyata thi
 King Dasharatha was heading towards Vanaprastha
 at: unhone rajyabhaar ram ko saunpne kaa sochaa
 There was also a pleasant wave in public that their beloved king is about to appoint their beloved prince as king
 us samay ram ke anya do bhai bharat or shatrughna apane nanihaal kaikey gaye hue the
 Kaikeyi's maid Manthara misleads Kaikeyi that the king is doing wrong with you
 tum raja kii priy rani ho to tumhaari santan ko raja bananaa chahie par raja dasharath ram ko raja bananaa chaahate hai
 a detailed account of Rama's childhood is found in the Balakanda of Swami Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas
 raja dasharath ke teen raniyaan thim: kaushalya, sumitra or kaikeyi
 Ram was the son of Kaushalya, Sumitra had two sons, Lakshmana and Shatrughna and Kaikeyi's son Bharata
 rajya niyamo se raja kaa jyeshtha ladkaa hi raja banane kaa paatr hota he at: ram ko ayodhya kaa raja bananaa nishchit tha
 Kaikeyi who twice saved Dasharatha's life and Dasaratha gave her the boon that she could ask for two brides at any moment of her life
 ram ko raja banate hue or bhavishya ko dekhte hue kaikeyi chaahati thi uskaa putr bharat hi raja bane, isliye unhone raja dasharath dwaara ram ko 14 varsh kaa vanvaas dilaayaa or apane putr bharat ke liye ayodhya kaa rajya maang liya
 In the verses, the king Dasaratha was forced to accept this
 ram ne apane pita kii ajna kaa paalan kiya
 Ram's wife Sita and her brother Lakshmana also went to exile
 vanvaas ke samay, ravan ne sita kaa haran kiya tha
 Ravana was a demon and the king of Lanka
 ramayana ke anusaar, jab ram, sita or lakshmana kutiyaa main the tab ek hiran kii vaani sunakar sita vyakul ho gayi
 That deer was Ravana's maternal uncle Marich
 usne ravan ke kehane par sunahare hiran kaa rup banaaya
 Sita was fascinated to see him and requested Shriram to hunt the deer
 shriram apni bharya kii ichha puri karne chal pade or lakshmana se sita kii raksha karne ko kaha| marich shriram ko bahut dur le gaya
 On getting the opportunity, Shriram shot an arrow and killed the deer Marich
 marate-marate marich ne jor se "he sita! he lakshmana!" kii awaz lagaayi| us awaz ko sun sita chintit ho gayin or unhone lakshmana ko shriram ke paas jane ko kaha| lakshmana janaa nahin chaahate the, par apni bhabhi kii baat ko inkaar na kar sake
 Laxman drew a line before leaving, which is popularly known as Laxman Rekha
 ram, apane bhai lakshmana ke saath sita kii khoj main dar-dar bhatak rahe the
 Then they met two apes named Hanuman and Sugriva
 hanuman, ram ke sabase bade bhakt bane
 In order to reclaim Sita, Bhagavan Rama defeated Hanuman, Vibhishana and the monkey army with the help of Hanuman, Vibhishana and Vanara Sena, and on returning, guided Vibhishan to the good ruler by making him the king of Lanka
 bhagwaan ram ne jab ravan ko yuddh main parrast kiya or uske chote bhai vibhishana ko lanka kaa raja bana diya
 Ram, Sita, Lakshman and some monkeys departed from the Pushpak plane towards Ayodhya

 The entire state started spending efficient time

 Thereafter, the life of Ram's birth was also completed

 madhavidhatuvritti main aadi shankaracharya dwaara bhattikavy par pranit tikaa kaa ullekh miltaa he
 The epic text of this epic is Valmikkrit Ramayana
 mahakavy main chaar kand hai
 From the point of view of the story of the story, this epic is divided into 22 circles and is coordinated with the overall characteristics of the epic
 rachana kaa mukhya uddeshy vyakaran evam sahitya ke lakshanon ko lakshya dwaara upasthit karne kaa he
 This epic is divided into four kandas in order to present the symptoms by the target, in which three kandas serve the purpose of the author by using various word forms according to Sanskrit grammar
 madhya main ek cond kavyasaushthav ke katipay angon ko abhilakshith kar rachaa gaya he
 The sequence of composition is such that the first case grammatically stores a wide variety of word forms
 dwitiya cond 'adhikaar cond' he jisamen panineey vyakaran ke katipay vishisht adhikaron main pradarshit niyamon ke anusaar shabdaprayog he
 The third episode has been designed with a view to reflecting literary characteristics, hence Mahakavi has termed this incident as 'prasad Kand'
 is cond main chaar adhikaran hai : pratham adhikaran main shabdalankar evam arthalankar ke lakshya hai
 In the second tribunal, the nature of the virtue has been demonstrated by the target, in the third tribunal, while displaying the nature of emotionality, highlights various elements and measures of politics according to the theme of the plot
 prasann cond kaa chauthaa adhikaran is mahakavy kaa ek vishesh rup he
 It contains such verses that have parallel incorporation of Sanskrit and Prakrit language, the same verse is sub-stitched in Sanskrit, whose verse is also the same form of Prakrit verse and both languages have the same prophetic meaning
 bhashaa sam kaa udhaaharan prastut karata hua yah ansh bhattikavy kii nijee visheshta he
 The last episode again demonstrates the varied word form of the trinity, a complex form of Sanskrit grammar
 yah cond sabase bada he
 Symptomatic, in terms of the division of the Kathaavastu in these four scandals, the first five cantos are described in which the undertaking of Ramjanma, Sita Vivaha, Rama's Vanagman and Sitaharan and Rama's seeding are described respectively
 dwitiya cond agle chaar sargo ko vyaapt karata he jisamen sugriv kaa rajbhishek, vanar bhaton dwaara sita kii khoj, laut aane par ashokavatika kaa bhang or maaruti ko pakadakar sabha main upasthit kiye jane kii kathavstu varnit he
 Thirdly, there are the next four cantos in Prasannakand which include the performance of Sita's cognition, the description of Prabhat in Lanka, the story of Vibhishana's arrival with Rama and the story of the bridge
 antim, tisaint cond agle nau sarg le letaa he jinamein sharbandh se lagaakar raja ramchandra ke ayodhya laut aane tak kaa kathabhag varnit he
 There are 1625 verses in four episodes and 22 sergoes, of which the first verse Mangalacharan is objective and the last verse is of poetry
 1625 padyasankhya ke is mahakavy main adhikansh prayog anushtubh shlokon kaa he jinamein sarg chah, nau tathaa 14 vaan evam 12 vaan
 In the tenth canto various verses have been used of which Puppitagra is prominent
 inke atirikt praharshini, malini, aupchchhandsik, vanshastha, vaitaliya, ashvalalit, nandan, prithvi, ruchira, narkutak, tanumadhya, trotak, drutvilambit, pramitakshra, praharnaklika, mandakrantha, shardoolavikreedit evam sragdhara kaa chhutput prayog dikhaai detaa he
 From the point of view of literature, there is mainly ozoguna and gauri ritual in Bhattikavya, however other Madhuryadi qualities and Vaidarbhi and Lahti rituals are also available in sufficient quantity
 swayan praneta ke anusaar bhattikavy kii rachana gurjar desh ke antargat balbhi nagar main hui
 The name of the poet Bhatti is an abrasive form of the word "bhartru"
 katipay sameekshak kavi kaa puraa naam bhartruhari maanate hai, parantu yah bhartruhari nishchit hi shatakatray ke nirmaataa athwa vaakyapadiya ke praneta bhartruhari se bhinn hai
 The Bhatti surname is related to Bhartrihari poet Valbhiranesh Sridhar Sen
 mahakavi bhatti kaa samay isvi chhathi shatabdi kaa uttarardh sarvasammat he
 The examples indicated in the Alankara class show that Bhatti and Bhamah are followers of the same tradition
 bhattikavy kii rachana ke purv lagbhag 10 shatabdiyon tak panini kaa ashtaadhi kaa hi gahan pathan-pathan hota aa rahaa tha
 Bhatti's aim was to create a tool that would make Ashtadhyayi's study easier
 aisa unhone pehle se maujuud vyakaran ke bhashyagranthon main die gayi udaahranon ko ramakatha ke saath sambaddh karke kiya
 This led to simplicity and simplicity in learning

 For hundreds of years, the Chandravanshi king of Bharat Rajkula ruled the city of Kashi
 kaashi tab aaryon ke purvi nagaron main se thi, purv main unke raaj kii seemaa
 The country beyond that was considered impure
 Chandravanshee King Jarasandha reigned in Magadha before Mahabharata and Kashi also merged into the same kingdom

 In those days, four states prevailed in India, who used to fight each other equally to win each other
 ye raahya the magadh, kosal, vatsa or ujjayini
 Sometimes Kashi passed into the hands of Vatsas, sometimes Magadha and sometimes Kosal
 parswanath ke baad or buddha se kuch pehle, kosal-shravasti ke raja kansa ne kaashi ko jitkar apane raaj main mila liya
 King Mahakoshal of the same clan then married his daughter Kosal Devi to King Bimbasar of Magadha and started giving annual income of one lakh rupees per annum as dowry and thus Kashi came under the control of Magadha
 raaj ke lobh se magadh ke raja bimbsar ke bete ajatshatru ne pita ko markar gaddi chin lee
 Then his brother Prasenjit, the brother of Kosal, saddened by the grief of the widowed sister Kosaladevi, stopped giving Kashi's income to Ajatshatru, which resulted in Magadha and Kosal Summer
 isamen kabhi kaashi kosal ke, kabhi magadh ke haath lagi
 Ultimately Ajatshatru won and Kashi merged into his growing empire
 baad main magadh kii rajdhani rajgrih se patliputra chali gai or phir kabhi kaashi par uskaa akraman nahin ho paaya
 The modern Kashi state has become the Bhumihar Brahmin state of Varanasi
