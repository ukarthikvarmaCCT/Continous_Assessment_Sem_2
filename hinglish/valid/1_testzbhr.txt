 The industry has decided to move towards inkjet printing due to its low cost and flexibility in use
 istemaal in main se ek incjet saura cell he
 The first example of the construction of a solar cell with an inkjet printer was by Konarca at 2011 Oregon State University MCC IGS was able to find a way to make c IGS solar cells using an inkjet printer

 saamaanya incjet main saura koshikaon ko ek saura cell substrate ardhchaalak padaarth or electrode neeche daal karne ke liye ek incjet printer kaa upyog karke banaaya jaataa he
 Both organic and inorganic solar cells inkjet method can be used
 incjet mudrit acarbonic saura koshikaon ko mukhya rup si ai ji es saura koshikaon rahe hai
 Organic solar cells are versatile solar cells
 First, the ink must be prepared
 aam taur par syaahi acarbonic maamle main ek dhaatu namak ke mishran se bana he
 In the organic case the ink is a polymer fullerene mixture
 syaahi to ek substrate jo bhinn ho sakate hai par chapa hua he

 The main advantage to printing solar cells with an inkjet printer is the low cost of production
 kaaran yah anya tareekon kii tulana main sasta he, kyonki koi he vaikumupkaran sasta banaata he, jo aavashyak he
 In addition, the ink is a low cost metal salt mixture to reduce the cost of solar cells
 ardhchaalak padaarth neeche rakhana karne incjet printer kaa upyog karte samay bhaap charan bayaan jaise anya tareekon kii tulana main maal kii bahut kam barbaadi he
 This is because the printer is capable of making precise contours with little waste
 kuch incjet saura koshikaon paaramparik silicon saura panelon kii tulana main adhik saura kshamta he jo saamagree si ai ji es kaa upyog karen
 The use of CIGS makes it very important to have a little waste to how rare some of the materials are because of this
 yah anya tareekon kii tarah saura cell taiyaar karne ke liye jahrile rasayanon ke upyog kii aavashyaktaa nahin he kyonki is vidhi ko bhi paryaavaran ke anukool he
 The efficiency of inkjet solar cells is also low to be economically viable
 yahaan tak ki agar dakshata behatar ho jaataa he saamagree saura koshikaon ke liye istemaal ek samasya ho sakati he
 Indium is a rare material used in these cells and may have gone away within 15 years according to our current use
 ek or mudda ek mausam pratirodhi syaahi he ki kathor paristhitiyon jivit rah sakate hai paidaa kar rahi he
 Photovoltaic materials in conventional solar cells maintain that materials typically cost more than the material itself
 Inkjet mudran ke saath yah kaagaj par saura koshikaon mudrit karne ke liye sambhav he
 This will allow solar cells to be quite inexpensive and can be placed almost anywhere
 kaagaj patali saura koshikaon yaa ant main pratyaksh3 di printig saura koshikaon, khidakiyon main, parde main andhaa kar rahi he par banane ke liye, or lagbhag ghar main kahin bhi anumati degaa

 angreji ke "van act play" shabd ke liye hindi main "ekanki naatak" or "ekanki" donon hi shabdon kaa samaan rup se vyavhaar hota he
 Acacia in the West became extremely popular and popular in the 20th century, especially after the First World War
 hindi or anya bhartiya bhashaaon main uskaa vyapak prachlan is shatabdi ke chauthe dashak main hua
 This does not mean that Ekanki literature is a completely insignificant genre
 purv or pashchim donon ke natya sahitya main uske nikatavarti rup milte hai
 Many of the distinctions of metaphors and epithets based on the character, chivalry, chronology, rasa, etc
 of the hero in Sanskrit Natyasastra have been described by Dr
 Keith as Ekanki Nataka
 is prakaar "dasharupak" or "sahityadarpan" main varnit vyayog, prahasan, bhaag, vithi, naatika, goshtee, sattak, natayaraasak, prakashika, ullapya, kavy prenkhan, srigadith, vilasika, prakaranika, hallish aadi rupakon or uparupakon ko aadhunik ekanki ke nikat sambandhi kahana anuchit na hoga
 "the word" Ekk "is also used in Sahityadarpan: bhaan : syad dhoortcharito nanavasthantaraatmak :
 Ekkta Ek Evatra Adept: Pandito Vit:
 
 And khyathetivritto vyayog: swalpastrijansanyut:
 Hino womb miscarriage 
 Expectation 


 pashchim ke natyasahitya main aadhunik ekanki kaa sabase praarambhik or aviksit kintu nikatavarti rup "interlude' he
 Hilarious passages are also added to overcome the boredom born of the sermon of virtue and moral educative English morality plays practiced in the 15th and 16th centuries
 aise hi khand interlude kahe jate the
 These became independent of morality plays respectively and eventually culminated in the satirical-humor-oriented short plays of the three characters
 "kartin reiser' yaa patonnayak kaha janevaala ekanki, jisaki tulana sanskrit naatakon ke arthopakshepak yaa prekshank se kii ja sakati he, pashchim main aadhunik ekankiyon kaa nikatatam purvavarti tha
 Due to the elite socials coming to the theater after eating food late at night, the ordinary socialists who came on time had great inconvenience
 rangashaalaon ke maalikon ne is bich saadhaaran saamaajikon ko manoranjan main vyast rakhane ke liye dwipatriya prahasanpurn samvaad prastut karnaa shuru kiya
 This type of independent dialogue was called the "curtain Razor"
 isamen kathanak evam jivan ke yatharth or naatakeey dwandv kaa abhaav rahata tha
 Subsequently, "curtain Razor" was replaced by well-planned short plays with realistic plot and dramatic duality
 inke vikaas kaa aglaa kadam aadhunik ekanki tha
 Ekanki became so popular that in order to protect big plays, the commercial theater houses started removing it from them
 lekin usamen prayog or vikaas kii sambhaavnaaon ko dekhakar pashchim ke kai deshon main avyavsaayik or prayogtmak rangamanchi andolanon ne use apana liya
 London, Paris, Berlin, Dublin, Chicago, New York etc
 carried forward this new form of drama and its theater
 iske atirikt ekanki naatak ko pashchim ke anek mahan yaa sammanit lekhakon kaa bal mila
 Such authors include Chekhov, Gorky and Ekrinov of Russia, Giraudo, Sartre and Enail of France, Taller and Brecht of Germany, Pirandelli of Italy and Oscar Wilde, Galsverdi, j
m
bary, Lord Dunsainy, Synge of England, Ireland and the USA , Shion o'casey, Eugene o'neill, Noel Coward, t
s
illiot, Christopher Fry, Graham Greene, Miller, etc
, are notable
 rangamanchi andolanon or in lekhakon ke sammilit evam adamya prayogtmak saahas or utsaah ke falswaroop aadhunik ekanki sarvatha nai, swatantra or suspasht vidha ke rup main pratishthit hua
 The general characteristics of Ekanki plays can be studied on the basis of their works
 sataha par hi bade naatakon or ekankiyon kaa akaargat antar spasht ho jaataa he
 Ekanki plays can usually be played in 20 to 30 minutes, while three, four or five-digit plays take several hours to perform
 lekin bade naatakon or ekankiyon kaa aadharbhoot antar aakaaratmak na hokar rachanaatmak he
 In the three to five-digit plays of the West, two or more storylines were intertwined
 is prakaar unamem ek pradhan kathanak or ek yaa kai upakthanak hote the
 Sanskrit plays also had such subtitles
 aise naatakon main sthaan yaa drishy, kaal or ghatnakram main anwarat parivartan swaabhaavik tha
 But this is not possible in Ekanki
 ekanki kisi ek naatakeey ghatana yaa maansik sthiti par aadhaarit hota he or prabhaav kii ekaagratha uskaa mukhya lakshya he
 Therefore, compilation of place, time and event in Ekanki is considered to be mandatory
 kahani or geet kii tarah ekanki kii kala ghanatv yaa ekaagratha or mitvyayta kii kala he, jisamen kam se kam upkarnon ke sahare zyada se zyada prabhaav utpann kiya jaataa he
 Ekanki's storyline perspective is very narrow, there is only one main event, one main character, one climax
 lambey bhaashanon or vistrut vyakhyaaon kii jagah usamen samvadalaghav hota he
 The qualitative distinction between big drama and Ekanki is clear from this, that Ekanki cannot be created by cutting the body of big drama, just like pulling the body of Ekanki and creating a big drama
 sanskrit naatyashaastra ke anusaar bade naatak ke kathanak ke vikaas kii paanch sthitiyaan maani gai hai : aarambh, praytn, praptyasha, niyatapti or falaagam
 The Natyashastra of the West also mentions many similar situations: ascension, climax, descent, and end, from the beginning or role, ambush retraction or duality of characters and events to the climax of the plot
 pashchim ke naatakashastra main dwandv par bahut jor diya gaya he
 In fact, drama is an art of duality; In the larger drama, instead of the gradual development of characters and events in the narrative, the plot of the lives of some characters is revealed by leading the plot to its climax
 ekanki main is charmotkarsh kii dhuree keval ek dwandv hota he
 The development of duality can be quite slow in the plot of a big drama, with all events taking place in theaters, or just before the event that drastically brings the duel to its climax
 aksar yahi charmotkarsh ekanki kaa ant hota he
 In addition to the realistic and psychological depiction of life's problems, this feature of the composition distinguishes modern Ekanki from its adjacent forms in Sanskrit and Western theatrical literature
 aksar abhinay ke liye kahaniyon ke roopaantar se yah bhram paidaa hota he ki ekanki kahani kaa abhinaeya rup he
 But despite the basic similarity of density and austerity in composition, there is a distinct distinction between story and unity
 rangamanch kii vastu hone ke kaaran ekanki main abhinay or cathopakathan kaa mahatv sabase zyada he
 It is through these that Akanki creates the characterization, plot and contract of its duality, atmosphere and events
 kahani kii tarah ekanki varnan kaa aashray nahin le saktaa
 But a pose of acting can be more impressive than a longer narration of the story
 isliye rangamanch ekanki kii seemaa or shakti donon he
 Many successful storytellers are left unsuccessful because of its lack of recognition
 isi prakaar kisi vishay par rochak sambhaashan yaa cathopakathan ko ekanki samajhnaa bhramamaatr he
 In the absence of the reality of life, the story or the story, the duality of the characters, compilation, etc
, the speech remains only speech, it cannot be called Ekanki
 ekanki kii adbhut sambhaavnaaon ke kaaran aadhunik kaal main uskaa vikaas anek dishaao main hua he
 Radio metaphors, music and poetry, and monologues or welcome plays are some of the important achievements of these new directions
 radio ke madhyam se in sabake kshetra main nirantar prayog ho rahe hai
 In the absence of theater, always actors and actresses, their acting and postures, the radio metaphor has to use words and their sound and pictorial power more and more
 moort upkarnon kaa abhaav radio roopak ke liye sarvatha baadha hi nahin, kyonki shabd or dhwani ko unke moort aadhaaron se pruthak kar naatakkaar shrotaaon ke dhyaan ko charitron ke aantarik dwandvon par kendrit kar saktaa he
 The radio metaphor is barely 50 years old
 praarambhik avasthaa main isamen kisi kahani ko anek vyaktiyon ke swaron main prastut kiya jaataa tha or rangamanch kaa bhram utpann karne ke liye paatro kii akritiyon, veshbhusha, saaj sajja, ruchiyon ityadi ke vistrut varnan se yatharth vaataavaran ke nirmaan kaa praytn kiya jaataa tha
 In the western countries like USA, Germany, England etc
, the experiments of radio acuity developed and developed its form
 radio ke liye kai prasiddh amareeki or angrej kaviyon ne kavyarupak likhe
 Notable among them are mcleish, Stephen Vincent Bayne, Karl, Sandberg, Tyrom Githrui, Louis mcneice, Sackville West, Patrick Dickinson, Dealon Thomas, etc
 in prayogon se prerana grahan kar hindi or anya bhartiya bhashaaon ke ekankikaron ne bhi radio roopak, geetinaty or kavyarupak prastut kiye hai
 But they still have many errors
 hindi sahitya ke itihaaskaar ekanki kaa prarambh bhaaratenduyug se maanate hai
 The second phase of Prasad's "A Sip", the third from Bhubaneswar Prasad's "caravan" and the fourth phase has been started with Dr
 Ramkumar Varma's "silky Tie" compilation
 kintu ukt kalvibhaajan main un ekankikaron ko sammilit nahin kiya gaya he, jinhone 1955 i
 ke aasapaas likhnaa prarambh kiya he or aaj bhi likh rahe hai
 Therefore, the brief history of Hindi Ekanki is as follows: bhaaratendukaal main do prakaar ke ekanki likhe gaye
 First, translated or shaded singular and second, primordial acacia
 pehali koti main bhaaratendu kaa bagalaa ke "bharatmata' kaa anuwaad "bharat janani'; radhacharan goswami dwaara banglaa ke "bharter yavan' kaa anuwaad "bharatvarsh main yavan log', kaanchanacharya krit "dhananjay vijay' kaa chhayavisht roopak, ayodhysihan upaadhyaay kaa "pradhyumnvijay vyayog' aadi hai
 In the second category, India-centric "vishasvishmaushadham", "premjogini", Gitarupaka "niladevi" and "satipratap"; Radhacharan Goswami's "tanpanadhan Gosai Ke Arpan", "sati Chandrawali", "amarsingh Rathore", and "sridama"; Kishori Lal Goswami's "chaupat Chapat '; Radhakrishnadas's" Dukh Khinibala "; Ambikadatta Vyas composed "kali Yuga and Ghee" and "mind Ki Umang"; Srisharan's "balavivaha"; Balakrishna Bhatt's "kaliraj Ki Sabha", "rail's Khel Khel" and "child Marriage"; Pratapnarayan Mishra's "kalikautuk"; Devkinandan Tripathi's work "jai Narasimha Ki"; Kashinath Khatri's "rajkumaris of the Indus Country", "queen of Gunnaur" and "lajbo's Dream"; Lala Srinivasadas's "prahlad Charit"; Badrinarayan Premaghan's "prayag Ramagaman"; aitihaasik aakhyaan tathaa samajasudhar ke prasang hi uparyukt ekankiyon ke vishay hai
 These can be said to be the initial form of modern unity
 kala kaa viksit rup inamen nahin miltaa; sheliyaan paraspar kuch bhinn hai par parampara ek hi he
 The above figures are more than the actors
 lekhakon kaa jhukaav jivan kii sthulata kaa varnan karne kii ore he; vrittiyon kii sookshm vivritti inamen nahin milti
 There are some, but not all, uses of introduction, preamble, sutradhar, nandi, mangalacharan, multiple visual planning, Bharatavakya etc
 aakaar sarvatra lambey hai, ank bhi drishy or drishy bhi garbhaak jaise ho gaye hai
 There is a lack of subsistence of compilations, the multiplicity and development of loose dialogues and the excess of configurationless planets
 inamen se kuch prahasan ke rup main likhe gaye hai, par unamem nirmal hasya na hokar vyangy kii maatra hi adhik he
 They lack the essential quality function required for a unit
 ekanki ke duusare yug main jaishankar prasad kaa "ek ghunt' likhaa gaya jisapar sanskrit kaa bhi prabhaav he or banglaa ke madhyam se aae paashchaatya ekanki shilp kaa bhi
 Prasad ji meanwhile also wrote "kalyani Parinay", but he is still unpublished
 saath hi, ise unke "chadrangupt' naatak kaa ek bhaag bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 Some of the plays of French playwright Mollier were also translated into Hindi during this period
 "ek ghunt' main ekanki ke kamobesh lagbhag sabhi aadhunik lakshan mil jate hai
 The marriage problem has been discussed and resolved in an emotional style
 parantu "ek ghunt' ek hi rah gaya; anya lekhakon ko yah ekanki lekhan kii ore pravrutt na kar sakaa
 The third phase of Ekanki begins with Bhuvanesvaprasad's "caravan 'collection which has six Ekankis
 1938 i main "hans' kaa ekanki ank prakashit hua
 The then representative Ekanki was presented
 isi bich satyendra kaa "kunal', prithvinath sharma kaa "duvidha', ramkumar verma kaa "prithviraj kii ankhen'; suryasharan pari kaa "belavan yaa pratigyaapurti' aadi prakashit hue
 Uday Shankar Bhatt, Seth Govinddas Prabhriti Ekankar also tended towards writing of Ekanki during this period and many of his powerful figures came to light
 is yug main prakhyat or utpaada donon prakaar ke kathankon ko lekar ekanki likhe gaye
 Vivahadi social and communist political problems have emerged prominently in them
 pracheen vichaardhaara kii vakaalat joardaar shabdon main kii gai he, parantu iske saath naveen ko apnaane kaa aagrah bhi spasht dikhaai padataa he
 With the influence of Western thought and style, Ekanki made a substantial change in its appearance and its technique brought about a certain degree of stability
 dekha jaae, to yah kaal ekanki vidha kaa parimarjan kaal tha
 Writers put their hands to this time with good use
 san 1935 i
 se radio prasaranon ke antargat ekankiyon ko bhi sthaan diya jane laga tha, at: radio ekanki athwa dhvaninataka bhi kaaphi sankhya main likhe jane lage
 By the time of reaching the fourth stage, the form of Ekanki, the craft, etc
 are completely stabilized, their authentic form comes out
 isse pehle to vah apana sahi rup talashne main laga tha
 This era originated from Dr
 Ramkumar Varma's "silky Tie" collection, it has already been told
 iske atirikt verma ji ke "actress', "rajani kii raat', "ek tole opium kii keemat', "pariksha', "nahin kaa rahasy', "kahan se kahan', "charumitra', "das minute' aadi ekanki prasiddh hai

 is yug ke ekanki swatantra evam sachesht bhav se likhe gaye hai
 Therefore, crafts are special among them

 According to the different and diverse interests of the era, the subjects of this period have also been many, including love, marriage, hatred, cruelty, murder, mythological narrative, folkloric and folkloric acts of heroes and kings, social evils, class struggle, patriotism, Hindu -musliman- Fraternity, Satyagraha, sexual devotion etc
 are prominent

 Hindi Ekanki starts on the fifth or final stage with various genres of Ekanki which can include "open Air Acanki", "chitra Ekanki" "galli Ekanki" etc
 in addition to stage and sound recording

 In the units of the fifth phase either the western composition process has been taken with rigor or in it the new form has been created by talent and intelligence, the new expression has created the original form
 geeton kaa inamen ekant abhaav he, prakaash kaa jamkar upyog kiya gaya he, jisamen pardo kii jarurat bahut kuch samaapt ho gai he

 Its highest speed was verified by James May in the November 2006 issue of Top Gear magazine, followed by its highest speed on the Volkswagen Group's private ehra-lesion test track, where the final production car clocked 407
9 km / h
 Which was equal to about one third of the speed of sound at sea level
 Since the Bugatti Veyron attained top speed during the test, May stated that "the tires will only last fifteen minutes, but that's no problem, because its fuel runs out in twelve minutes"
 He also informed the need for power, at a constant 155 mph, the Veyron uses about 270 of its 1001 horsepower

 smriti hindu dharm ke un dharmagranthon kaa samooh he jinaki manyata shruti se nichi shrenee kii hai or jo maanvon dwaara utpann the
 Vedas do not come in them
 smriti kaa shabdic arth he - "yaad kiya hua"
 Although Smriti is ranked below Vedas, they are read by most Hindus, as Vedas are very difficult to understand and Smriti has easy stories and moral preaching
 isaki seemaa main vibhinn dharmik granthon—gita, mahabharat, vishnusahasranam kii bhi gananaa kii jane lagi
 Shankaracharya has considered all these texts as memory
 manu ne shruti tathaa smriti mahatta ko samaan mana he
 Gautama Rishi has also said that 'vedo Dharmamul Tuddhidancha Smritiheela'
 hardutt ne gautam kii vkhakhya karte hue kaha ki smriti se abhipraay he manusmriti se
 But this interpretation of them does not seem appropriate because Smriti and Sheela have used these words as a source, not for any specific memory book or piety
 smriti se abhipraay he vedavidon kii samaran shakti main padi un roodhi or paramparaon se jinka ullekh vaidic sahitya main nahin kiya gaya he tathaa sheel se abhipraay he un vidwaanon ke vyavhaar tathaa aachaar main ubharate pramaanon se
 Nevertheless, Apastamb has said in the beginning of his Dharma-sutra, 'dharmajnyasamay: proof Vedashta'
 smritiyon kii rachana vedon kii rachana ke baad lagbhag 500 isa purv hua
 Sixth century BC The earlier social religion was based on Vedas and Vedic-era behavior and traditions
 aapstamb dharm-sutara ke prarambh main hi kaha gaya he ki iske niyam samayaacharik dharm ke aadhaar par aadhaarit hai
 Periodical religion means social tradition
 sab saamaajik parampara kaa mahatva isliye tha ki dharamshastron kii rachana lagbhag 1000 i
pus
 ke baad hui
 Backwards, the traditional practices lying in the memory of the deities were compiled by the sages in memory books
 isaki manyata samaaj main isiilie sweekaar kii gai hogi ki jo baaten ab tak likhit nahin thim keval parampara main hi uskaa swaroop jivit tha, ab likhit rup main saamne ain
 Therefore, the booklet form of these traditions, compiled from the memories of the courtesans, was named Smriti
 peeche chalakar smriti kaa kshetra vyapak hua
 The language of memory was simple, the rules were timely and new situations were taken care of
 atah ye adhik jangrahya tathaa samaaj ke anukool bane rahe
 Nevertheless, the importance of Shruti was more accepted than her
 parantu peeche inke bich sandhi sthapit karne ke liye brihaspati ne kaha ki shruti or smriti manushya ke do netra hai
 If only one importance is given then the man will become Kana
 atri ne to yahan tak kaha ki yadi koi veda main purna paarangat ho smriti ko ghrinaa kii drushti se dekhtaa ho to ikkis baar pashu yoni main uskaa janm hoga
 It is thus clear from the statement of Jupiter and Atri that the importance of memory like Vedas is now accepted
 peeche chalakar saamaajik chalan main shruti ke upar smriti kii mahatta ko sweekaar kar liya gaya jaise dattak putr kii parampara kaa vedon main jahaan virodh hai vahiin smritiyon main isaki sweekruti di gai he
 Similarly, the composition of memories became wider than the composition period of Panchamahayagna Srutis
 vedon ke anusaar jhanjhaavat main, atithiyon ke aane par, poornima ke din chaatro ko swadhyay karnaa chahie kyonki in dinon main saswar paath karne kii manaahi thi
 But the memory these days also closed Swadhyaya
 shudron ke sambandh main shruti kaa yah spasht nirnay he ki ve moksh nahin praapt kar sakate hai parantu upanishdon ne shudron ke upar se yah bandhan hataa diya evam unke moksh prapti kii manyata sweekaar kar lee gai
 All these facts prove that the anti-traditions of memory on the prescribed traditions of Shruti got social recognition
 smritiyon kii is mahatta kaa kaaran bataate hue marichi ne kaha he ki smritiyon ke jo vachan nirarthak yaa shruti virdohi nahin hai ve shruti ke hi praaroop hai
 The Vedic verses are mysterious and scattered, which are explained in memoirs in convenience
 smriti vaakya paramparaon par aadhaarit hai atah inke liye vaidic pramaan kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Their altar authenticity is automatically acceptable
 vaidic bhashaa janamanas ko adhik duruh prathit hone lagi thi, jabaki smritiyaan loukik sanskrit main likhi gai thim jise samaaj saralata se samaj saktaa tha tathaa ve saamaajik vyavastha ke anuroop siddhantpratipaadit karti thim
 Like the Vedic maharishis, the society was given dignity to the memory writers
 vaidic or smriti kaal ke bich vyavhaaron tathaa paristhitiyon ke badalane se evam vibhinn aarthik kaarnon or naveen vichaaron ke samagam se smriti ko shruti kii apeksha praathamikta mili
 The reason for this can also be stated that was in favor of sociological recognition
 in sab kaarnon se shruti kii manyata ko smritiyon kii manyata ke sammukh 500 isa purv se mahatvaheen samajha jane laga
 The ancient Indians worked hard to ensure that the ancient texts of India continued to be transferred from one generation to the other in original form

 Some of them have written very high-quality literature
 aisi boliyon main brajabhasha or avadhi pramukh hai
 These dialects are the diversity of Hindi and also its power
 ve hindi kii jadon ko gaharaa banaati hai
 There are dialects of Hindi and dialects of those dialects which not only contain a great tradition, history and civilization but also their creation against the freedom struggle, mass struggle, present-day marketism, and the world is conscious
 mote taur par hind kii kisi bhashaa ko 'hindi' kaha ja saktaa he
 Before the British rule, it was used in this sense
 par vartmaankaal main saamanytah iskaa vyavhaar us vistrut bhukhand ko bhashaa ke liye hota he jo pashchim main jaisalmer, uttar pashchim main ambala, uttar main shimla se lekar nepal kii tarai, purv main bhagalpur, dakshin purv main raipur tathaa dakshin-pashchim main khandwa tak faili hui he
 There are two main differences of Hindi - Western Hindi and Eastern Hindi
 jaisaa upar kaha gaya he, apane simit bhashashastreey arth main hindi ke do uparup maane jate hai - pashchimi hindi or purvi hindi
 There are five dialects under Western Hindi - Khadi Boli, Bangru, Braj, Kannauji and Bundeli
 khadi boli apane mul rup main meerut, bijanour ke aasapaas boli jaati he
 On the basis of this, the form of modern Hindi and Urdu emerged
 bangaru ko jatu yaa hariyanvi bhi kehete hai
 It is spoken in the southeast of Punjab
 kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar bangaru khadi boli kaa hi ek rup he jise punjabi or rajasthani kaa mishran he
 Brajbhasha is spoken in Brajmandal around Mathura
 hindi sahitya ke madhyayug main brajabhasha main ucch koti kaa kavy nirmit hua
 Therefore, it was respectfully called a language rather than a dialect
 madhyakaal main yah boli sampurna hindi pradesh kii saahitiyik bhashaa ke rup main maanya ho gai thi
 But in the literary Brajbhasha, along with the typical words of Braj, the words and experiments of other provinces are also eclipsed
 kannauji ganga ke madhya doaab kii boli he
 On one side is Brajmandal and on the other side is the region of Awadhi

 There are three branches of Eastern Hindi - Awadhi, Bagheli and ds Chhattisgarhi
 avadhi ardhamagadhi praakrit kii parampara main he
 It is spoken in Awadh
 iske do bhed hai - purvi avadhi or pashchimi avadhi
 Awadhi is also called Baiswadi
 tulsi ke ramcharitamanas main adhikanshat: pashchimi avadhi milti hai or jaaysi ke padmavat main purvi avadhi
 Bagheli is prevalent in Baghelkhand
 yah avadhi kaa hi ek dakshini rup he
 Chhattisgarhi is a dialect of territory stretching from the border of Palamu to Bastar in the south and from the border of Baghelkhand in the west to the border of Orissa
 isamen pracheen sahitya nahin miltaa
 Some folklore has been created in the present period
 hindi pradesh kii teen upbhashaayen or hai - bihari, rajasthani or pahari hindi
 Bihari has three branches - Bhojpuri, Magahi and Maithili
 bihar ke ek kasbe bhojpur ke naam par bhojpuri boli kaa namakaran hua
 But Bhojpuri is spread in Uttar Pradesh more than Bihar
 bihar ke shahabaad, champaran or saaran jile se lekar gorakhpur tathaa baras kamishnari tak kaa kshetra bhojpuri kaa he
 Bhojpuri is closer to Eastern Hindi
 hindi pradesh kii boliyon main bhojpuri bolanewaalon kii sankhya sabase adhik he
 Ancient literature is not available in this, but in addition to the village songs, there is an attempt to create some literature in the present era

 The modern literature of Magahi is very rich and it has published works in almost all genres
 maithili ganga ke uttar main darbhaga ke aasapaas prachlit he
 Its literary tradition is old

 There are four main dialects or divisions of Rajasthani - Mewati, Malvi, Jaipuri and Marwari
 marwari kaa prachlan sabase adhik he
 Some scholars also take Bhili under Rajasthani
 pahari upbhasha rajasthani se milti julati hai
 It spreads from Nepal to Shimla in the southern part of the North Himalayas of the Hindi state
 isaki teen shakhaayen hai - purvi, madhyavarti or pashchimi
 Eastern hill is the main language of Nepal which is also called Nepali and Parambatiya
 madhyavarti pahari kumayun or gadhwal main prachlit he
 It has two distinctions - Kumaoni and Garhwali
 ye pahari upbhashaayen nagari lipi main likhi jaati hai
 Old literature is not available in them

 duniya bhar se lakhon buddha anuyaayi ekatta hokar har saal 14 oktober ke din ise dikshabhumi, maharashtra main manaate he
 The Bodhisattva Dr
 Babasaheb Ambedkar, the creator of the Indian Constitution in the mid-20th century, adopted Buddhism on October 14, 1956, with 5,00,000 followers in Nagpur on the day of Ashoka Vijayadashami

 ye jelly jaisi ek vastu dwaara ghiri hoti hai
 This coating is called cytoplasm or cell-membrane
 This membrane is subcutaneous permeable, which means that this membrane allows a substance to cross freely, allow a limited amount of passage, or even stop
 ise kabhi-kabhi 'jeevadravya kala' bhi kaha jaataa he
 The following structures are found within it: - kuch khaas bhinnataaon ko chhod sabhi prakaar kii koshikaon, padap evam jantu koshika kii sanrachana lagbhag ek jaisi hoti he
 They are made up of both living and non-living units

 The cytoplasm is the outermost covering or enclosure of the cell
 padap koshika main koshika bhitti or koshika jhilli milakar koshikaavaran kaa nirmaan karte hai
 The cell wall is not found in the animal cell, so the cell membrane is the outermost covering
 koshika jhilli evam kendrak ke bich ke bhaag ko koshika dravya kaha jaataa he, isamen vibhinn koshikang hote hai
 The nucleus is a round and dense structure found inside the cell
 kendrak ko koshika kaa 'mastishk' kaha jaataa he
 Just as the brain controls all the functions of the body, in the same way all the functions of the cell are controlled by the nucleus
 ek koshika main saamanytah ek hi cendrak hota he, kintu kabhi-kabhi ek se adhik cendrak bhi paae jate hai
 It is the operating center of all the functions of the cell

 Many of his works have been described, which depend on his shape
 tathaapi inkaa mukhya kaary koshikeey shwasan batalaaya jaataa he
 These are called the 'power plants' of the cell, because they supply the necessary energy
 yah jalika koshikadravya main aashyon or nalikaaon ke rup main faili rahati he
 Its position is usually between the centripetal membrane and the fluid, but it often extends throughout the cell
 yah jalika do prakaar kii hoti he : chikani satahavaali or khurduri satahavaali 
 Its surface is rough because ribosome particles are scattered on it
 iske anke kaary batalaaye gaye hai, jaise yantric aadhaaran, dravyon kaa prayaavartan, ant: koshikeey abhigaman, protone sanshleshan ityadi
 The word is made up of the words chrome and soma, which means: colored objects

 vah samaj gaya ki punjab ke mughal soobedaar ke galat samaacharon se vah bhramit hua tha, saath hi use guru govind singh kii veerta tathaa pratishtha kaa bhi anubhav hua
 Aurangzeb sent Jabardar and Muhammad Yar Mansabdar to Delhi with a royal decree, ordering Guru Govind Singh not to cause any trouble and bring him respectfully
 parantu guru govind singh ko kaaphi samay tak yah gyaat nahin hua ki bhai dayaa singh ahmednagar main aurangzeb ko jafarnama dene main safal hue yaa nahin

 'then wrote, what happened if four of my children were killed, but the snake of the horoscope still remains
 ' Guru Govind Singh advised Aurangzeb to learn from history, writing, 'where are Sikandar and Sher Shah? Where is Timur, where is Babur, where is Humayun, where is Akbar? He once again wrote to Aurangzeb, writing, 'if i persecute the weak, persecute them, i swear i will one day tear my eyes off

 After marriage, she moves to Kolkata and ends all contact with Barfi
 isi bich main barfi ke pita biimaar ho jate hai or pita ke ilaaj ke liye barfi ko dhan kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 After an unsuccessful bank robbery attempt, Barfi contemplates kidnapping Jhilmil, his childhood henchman friend and sole heir of his rich grandfather
 apane aagaman par vah dekhtaa he ki jhilmil kaa to pehle se hi apharan ho chukaa he
 He sees her in a van and sneaks into her and drives Jhilmil away from the ransom-collecting location

 apni purv nirdeshit film kits ke nirmaan ke dauraan, nirdeshak anuraag basu ne do-prishthon kii ek laghu kahani likhi jo baad main barfi! kii patakatha ke rup main viksit hui
 The script written by Basu and the reading of the film go back and forth between the two time periods
 basu kaa kahana he ki film-patakatha paatro ke liye 30- varsh kii samyavadhi maangati he atah film kii prishthbhumi 1970 rakhi gayi
 In June 2010, Anurag Basu confirmed that the film will feature three people, a deaf and dumb man, a mentally challenged girl and a recital
 yadhyapi basu ne nirdisht kiya tha ki film ullaspurn hogi, film ke khamoshi athwa silence jaise purv sheershakon ke bare main media rapaten kahati hai ki kahani gambheer tathaa andheri he
 According to Basu, he used these comedies as a tribute to the physical comedy inspired by the silent films of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin
 nirdeshak anuraag basu ne film main ranbir kapur ko lene kaa nirnay patakatha likhnaa armbh karne se purv hi le liya tha or uske vaachak ke rup main katrina caff pehali pasand thi
 In March 2010, The Times of India reported that Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif had been selected for the lead roles in the film and the title was Khamoshi, after which the title was changed to silence, Basu also confirmed
 basu svaparayan ladki kaa abhinay nibhaane ke liye kolkata se ek nayi ladki ko film main lenaa chaahate the
 Basu's wife suggested Chopra's name for the performance
 parantu basu ko ashanka thi ki darshak prasiddh abhinetri hone ke naate "priyanka chopra" ko dekhenge paatr ko nahin
 Basu said, "I was afraid that i would be seeing Priyanka Chopra as the character of Jhilmil and it would not be possible to portray the Jhilmil character properly
 yah bahut filmon ke saath ho chukaa he jahaan gyaat chehre ne paatr ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 "priyanka Chopra played some part but it was not announced as Basu first wanted to work on it and see how it goes
 teen din kii kaaryshaala ke pashchaat, aashwast ho gayi ki chopra svaparayan ladki kaa abhinay kar sakati hai tathaa pratibimbit kiya ki wo khush hai ki unhone priyanka ko is abhinay ke liye chunaa
 Later, Basu stated directly that he did not urge anyone other than Chopra to act as Swaparayan
 film main chopra kaa chayan karne ke baad kaiff ne agyaat kaarnon se yojana ko chhod diya
 The media reported that Chopra may have opted out of the film due to the strong acting part
 baad main, media ne prativedit kiya ki asin ne caff ke sthaan par vaachak ke abhinay ke liye prastaav rakhaa tha
 Although Asin never opted for an offer in the film
 media rapaton ke anusaar koi bhi anya abhinetri film main abhinay nahin karnaa chaahati kyonki unke anusaar svaparayan bhaag bahut majboot he
 In July 2010, Mumbai Mirror wrote that Chopra is ready to act as a reader and is skipping Swaprayan's acting, so other actresses may be scheduled for the film; Chopra does not want the film to stop
 basu ne film ke vikaas kii pushti kii or kaha, "yah satya he ki ham anya bhaag kaa paatr-nirdhaaran karne main asamarth rahe hai
 "after facing many problems related to character determination, Basu chose a completely new face to act for another female character
 disambar 2010 ke purvarddh main eliana di'cruge ko vaachak evam kapur ke pehle pyaar kii dwitiya pramukh mahila abhinay ke liye chunaa gaya
 Ranbir Kapoor acted as a deaf and dumb man in the film
 ranbir ke anusaar, unhone screen kinvadantiyon jaise academy award vijeta abhinayta, roberto benigni, charlie chaplin or apane pitamah raaj kapur se prerana lee
 Due to the physical disability of the protagonist, Basu did not want to use any sign language, but the film uses some practical patterns
 kapur ne apane paatr kaa varnan karte hue kaha ki vah ek mastamaula or achche dil vaala aadmi he
 His father Rishi Kapoor has a different view of Ranbir's performance in the film
 unke anusaar - "unhen ek actor ke taur par ranbir kii filmein pasand nahin aatin, kyonki mujhe usamen abhi wo baat nahin najar aati he, jo ek behtareen actor main dikhti hai
 " priyanka chopra ne jhilmil kaa abhinay kiya he
 According to Basu, Chopra's acting was the most difficult part of the film
 apni bhoomika ke liye taiyaari karne ke liye chopra vibhinn maansik sansthaaon main gayin or svaparayan logon ke saath samay bitaayaa
 He says that he did research on acting because there is very little awareness of autism in India
 chopra ne bataaya ki ek hindi film nayika ke rup main shaayad unhen har avrodh kii sambhaavna kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 She mentioned that she needed two moments to become flabbergasted as she could not understand her character due to differences in her thinking and behavior
 di'cruge, jinhone vaachak ke rup main kahani bayaan kii he or film ke pramukh purush paatr kaa pratham pyaar kaa abhinay karti hai, kahati hai, "shruti, abhinay ke liye aise samvedansheel bhoomika he jaise ki vah film main ek anya hi charan main chali jaati he
 "according to Basu, the character of Inspector Dutta starring Saurabh Shukla is the most important after the characters of Kapoor, Chopra and d'cruz
 basu ne is paatr ko ko "adbhut" bataate hue varnan kiya he ki jab vah hansataa he to baaki paatro ko ronaa aa jaataa he
 Major photography began in March 2011
 barfi! kaa filmakan mukhya rup se darjeeling main june 2011 or farvari 2012 ke madhya kiya gaya
 In March 2011, Basu traveled to Kolkata to determine the location of filming in the city
 mumbai main filmakan 20 march 2011 ko armbh hua or may 2011 tak chalaa
 In June 2011, the hero heroine and other co-workers shot the film in Darjeeling
 disambar 2011 main, kuch drishy kaafii dur coimbatore, mukhya rup se polachi or uti main filmaaye gayi
 The scenes in which Kapoor's acting character is chased by a policeman on the roof were shot at the end of January 2012 in Kolkata
 chopra ke kuch vishesh drishyon ko chhodkar film kii shooting april 2012 tak purna hui
 The producers postponed the film's release date to July 13, until August 31, 2012, as shooting had not been completed in September 2011 and was awaiting filming
 basu ne eliana ke dabing ansh par april 2012 ke ant main hi kaary karnaa armbh kar diya tha kyonki di'cruge hindi bhashaa ke saath sahaj nahin thi or filmaane ke dauraan siikhnaa chaahati thim
 Pritam has composed the music and background music for the film and the lyrics have been penned by Swanand Kirkire, Ashish Pandit, Nilesh Mishra and Saeed Quadri

 Allowed the benefits of the company rule to reach the lowest level of Ramine society
 At the heart of the Ryotwari system was a particular theory of economic rent and based on the usefulness of David Ricardo's Rent Law, James Mill formulated the Indian Income Policy between 1819 and 1830
 "unhone kaha ki sarkaar mitti ke param prabhu kaa maananaa tha ki or 'kiraye' ke apane adhikaar kaa tyaag nahin karnaa chahie, yani mazdooree or anya sanchaalan vyay ko sulajhaa liya gaya tha jab amir dharti par upar chhod diya he laabh

" The mill government relied on each plot of measurement and evaluation and on soil fertility, which later The ryotwari settlements which consisted of taxation advocated
 The amount paid was nine tenths of the "rent" in the early 19th century and gradually fell later
