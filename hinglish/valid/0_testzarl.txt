 After being born, as a creature grows up, its physical plan evolves as prescribed, although some animals go through life in the process of metamorphosis
 adhikansh jantu gatisheel hote hai, arthath apane aap or swatantra rup se gati kar sakate hai
 Most animals are also hostile, that is, they depend on other animals to live
 adhiktam gyaat jantu sangh 542 karod saal pehle cambrian visphot ke dauraan jeevashm record main samudri prajatiyon ke rup main prakat hue
 The word 'animal' comes from the Latin language Animaale, the Nutter of Animalis, and is derived from Anima, meaning living breath or spirit
 aam bol-chaal kii bhashaa main, is shabd kaa istemaal gaiyr-maanviya jaanwaron ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The biological definition of the term includes all members of the Kingdom Animalaya, including humans
 jantuon main kai vishesh gun hote hai jo unhen anya sajiv vastuon se alag karte hai
 Animals are eukaryotic and multicellular, separating them from bacteria and most protists
 ve parposhi hote hai, saamanytah ek aantarik kaksh main bhojan kaa pachan karte hai, yah lakshan unhen paudhon va shaiwal se alag banaata he, ve bhi paudhon, shaiwalon or kavakon se vibhedit kiye ja sakate hen kyonki unamem kathor koshika bhitti kaa abhaav hota he, sabhi jantu gatisheel hote hai, chaahe jivan kii kisi vishesh pravastha main hi kyon na hon
 In most animals, the embryo passes through a blastula stage, a differential property of animals
 kuch apwaadon ke saath, sabase khaskar spanj or placosoa, jantuon ke sharir alag-alag utakon main vibhedit hote hai
 These include muscles, which are able to control contraction and movement, and nerve tissues, which send and respond to signals
 saath hi inamen ek praroopik aantarik pachan kaksh hota he jo 1 yaa 2 chhidron se yukt hota he
 Animals that have this type of organization are called metazoans, or eumetazoans when the former is commonly used for animals
 sabhi jantuon main eukeriotic koshikaayen hoti hai, jo colejan or pratyasth glycoprotein se bane bahirkoshikeey metrics se ghiri hoti hai
 It can be calcified to form structures such as shell, bone and spines
 vikaas ke dauraan yah ek apekshaakrit lacheela dhaancha bana leti hai jis par koshikaayen gati kar sakati hai or sambhav jatil saranchanaaen banaate hue punah sangathit ho sakati hai
 In contrast, cells of other multicellular organisms such as plants and fungi are surrounded by cell walls and thus develop by progressive growth
 iske alaava, jantuon kii koshikaon kaa ek adwitiya gun he antar koshikeey sandhiyaan: tite jankshan, gap jankshan or desmosome
 Almost all animals undergo some type of sexual reproduction process: polyploidy
 in main kuch vishesh prajnan koshikaayen hai jo chote gatisheel shukranujan yaa bade gatiheen andj ke utpaadan hetu ardhsutri vibhaajan karti hai
 They converge to form zygotes, which develop into new organisms
 kai jantuon main alangik prajnan kii kshamta bhi hoti he
 This can occur through anesthesia, where the egg develops into the embryo without fertilization, in some cases by fragmentation
 yugmanaj shuru main blastula naamak ek khokhale gole main viksit hota he, yah koshikaon kii punarvyavastha tathaa vibhedan kii prakriya se hokar gujarata he
 In the sponge, the blastula larva swims to a new location and develops into a new sponge

 It first intercalates to form a gastrula, which consists of a digestive chamber and two separate germ levels — an outer ectoderm and an internal endoderm
 shikaar ek jaivik antarkriya he jisamen ek shikari apane shikaar se bhojan praapt karata he
 Hunters may or may not kill their prey before eating, but the process of hunting always results in the death of the prey
 upbhog kii ek anya mukhya shrenee he mritposhan, mrit carbonic padaarth kaa upbhog
 It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between these two types of food behavior, for example, a parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay its eggs on it, so that their offspring receive food from its decomposing organic material

 ek duusare par lagaaye gaye chaynit dabaav ne shikaar or shikari ke bich vikasvaadi daud ko janm diya he, jiske parinamswaroop kai shikari virdohi anukulan viksit hue hai
 Most animals receive energy indirectly from sunlight
 paudhe prakaash sanshleshan naamak ek prakriya ke dwaara is urja kaa prayog karke surya ke prakaash ko saadhaaran sharkara ke anu main parivartit kar dete hai
 The process of photosynthesis begins with carbon dioxide and water, converting sunlight energy into chemical energy, which accumulates in the bonds of glucose, releasing oxygen during the process
 ab is sharkara kaa upyog nirmaan ikaayiyon ke rup main hota he, jisase paudhe main vruddhi hoti he
 When animals eat these plants, the sugars produced by the plants are used by animals
 yah yaa to jantu ke pratyaksh vikaas main sahaayak hoti he yaa apaghatit ho jaati he or sangrahit saura urja chhorati he or is prakaar se jantu ko gati ke liye aavashyak urja kii prapti hoti he
 This process is known as glycolysis
 jantu jo jal ushma nikaas ke kareeb yaa samudri tal par thande risaav ke najadik rahete hai, ve surya kii urja par nirbhar nahin hai
 Instead, synthesized organisms and bacteria form the basis of the food chain
 ] There is a general belief that animals have evolved from a flagellate eukaryote
 unke nikatatam gyaat sajiv sambandhi hai koeno kashabhiki, colerd kashabhiki jinaki aakaariki vishisht spanjon ke koeno cites ke saamaan he
 Molecular studies place animals in a superfamily group, called opisthokonts, which also include animals from the koeno flagellum, fungi and some small parasitic protists
 pehle jeevashm jo jantuon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, lagbhag 610 million varsh purv, purvacambrian kaal ke ant main prakat hue or ye adiakaran yaa vendian biota kehalaate hai
 But these are difficult to relate to later fossils
 Some may represent the predecessors of modern associations, but they may be distinct groups, and it is also possible that they are not actually animals
 unhen chhod kar, adhiktam gyaat jantu sangh, 542 million varsh purv, cambrian yug ke dauraan, swatah hi prakat hue
 It is still disputed whether this phenomenon, called the Cambrian explosion, represents a sharp divergence between different groups or the changes in conditions that made fossilization possible
 haalaanki kuch puratatvigyaani or bhuvaigyanik bataate hai ki jantu pehle soche jane vaale samay se kaaphi pehle prakat hue, sambhawatah 1 billian varsh purv
tonian yug main paae gaye jeevashm chinh jaise maarg or bill, tristareey krimiyon jaise metazoa kii upasthiti ko suchit karte hai, ye sambhawatah kentue kii tarah bade or jatil rahe honge 
 Also at the beginning of the Tonian era, stromatolite decreased about 1 billion years ago
 vividhta jo is samay stromatolait ke rup main charne vaale pashuon ke aagaman ko suchit karti he, ne ordovisian or parmian ke ant ke kuch hi samay baad, vividhta main vruddhi kii, jisase badi sankhya main charne vaale samudri jantu lupt ho gaye, unki jansankhya main punah prapti ke kuch hi samay baad unki sankhya main kami aa gayi
 The discovery, which is very similar to these early fossil marks, has its origins in the present-day giant size single-organism Protista organism Gromia sphaerica, doubting their interpretation as evidence of early animal development
 lambey arase pehle se spanj ko anya praarambhik jantuon se bhinn mana jaataa tha
 As noted above, the complex organization found in most other associations is not found in them, their cells are differentiated, but in most cases not organized into separate tissues
 spanj tane rahit hote hai or aam taur par inke chhidron ke madhyam se jal khinch kar bhojan praapt karte hai
 Archaeocyatha, which have a fused skeleton, may represent a sponge or a different association
 haalaanki, 2008 main 21 vanshon main 150 jeenon kaa ek faillo jinomik adhyayan bataata he ki yah tinophora yaa comb jelly he jo kam se kam un 21 sanghon main jantuo kaa aadhaar banaati he
 The authors believe that sponges — or at least the sponges they have discovered — are not so primitive, but can instead be simplified secondary
 anya sangho main, tinophora or nideria, jinamein samudri anemon, coral or jelifish shaamil hai, trigyat samamit hote hai, inamen ek hi chhidr se yukt pachan kaksh hota he, jo mukh or guda donon kaa kaam karata he
 Both have distinctly differentiated tissues, but are not organized into organs
 inamen keval do mukhya janan str hote hai, bahya tvak str or antah tvak str, jinke bich main keval koshikaayen bikhri hoti hai
 That is why these animals are sometimes called diploblastic
 chote placosoa samaan hai, lekin un main ek sthaayee pachan kaksh nahin hota he
 The remaining animals form a federal group called the bilateria
 adhiktam bhaag ke liye, ve dwiparshv samamit hote hai or aksar ek vishishtikrut sir hota he jo khaadya angon or samvedi angon se yukt hota he
 The body is tripleblastic, that is, all three reproductive layers are fully developed and tissues form differentiated organs
 pachan kaksh main do chhidr hote hai, ek mukh or ek guda, saath hi ek aantarik deh guha bhi hoti he jo ceylom yaa abhaasi deh guha bhi kehalaati he
 There are exceptions to each of these traits, however - adult echinoderms are radially symmetric and have very simplified physiological structures in typical parasitic animals
 anuvanshik adhyayan nen bailetria ke bheetar sambandh ko lekar hamaare gyaan ko kaaphi had tak badal diya he
 Most belong to two main genealogies: Deuterostomes and Protostomes, including Ecdysozoa, Platyzoa, and Lophotrochozoa
 is ke atirikt, dwiparshvasamamit jeevon ke kuch chote samooh hai jo in mukhya samoohon ke samaksh visarit hote hue prathit hote hai
 These include Aesolomorpha, Rhombozoa and Orthonectida
 aisa mana jaataa he ki mixojoa, ek koshikeey paraseete jinhen mul rup se protogon mana jaataa tha, bailetria se hi viksit hue hai
 Deuterostomes differ in many ways from other bilateria, protostomes
 donon hi maamalon main ek puraa pachan path paaya jaataa he
 However, in the protostome, the initial pore develops in the mouth and the anus develops separately
 duterostome main yah ulat he
 In most protostomes, cells normally fill in the inner part of the gastrula and form the middle reproductive level, this is called Schizosillus development, but in the deuterostome it is formed by the intracellular level of innervation, known as entrosylic pouching
 duterostome main adhar ke bajaay prishthiya tantrika rajju hota he or unke bhrun main bhinn prakaar kaa vidalan hota he
 All this suggests that deuterostomes and protostomes are distinctly federal levels
 duterostome ke pramukh sangh hai, ekainodermanta or cordeta
 The former is radially symmetric and is particularly marine, such as starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers
 duusare vaale main mukhya rup se kasheruki jeev hai jinamein ridh kii haddi pai jaati he
 These include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals
 inke atirikt duterostome main hemicordeta or ekon krimi bhi shaamil hai
 Although they are not currently found predominantly, significant fossil evidence relates to them
 chetognetha yaa tir krimi bhi duterostome ho sakate hai, lekin adhik haal hi main kiye gaye adhyayan protostome ke saath inke saannnidhya ko darshaate hai
 Ecdysozoa are protostomes, which have been named on the basis of a characteristic characteristic of growth by moulting or release
 sabase bada jantu sangh, aarthropoda inase sambandh rakhata he, jisamen krimi, makadiyaan, kekade or unke nikat sambandhi shaamil hai
 The body is divided into segments and typically there are paired appendages

 There are many important parasites
 in se sambandhit chote sangh hai nimetamorpha yaa ashwarom krimi or kinorehinka, priyapulida or loriciphera
 These groups have a truncated body, which is called virtual body cavity
 protostome ke shesh do samooh kabhi kabhi spirila ke saath rakhe jate hai, kyonki donon main bhrun kaa vikaas sarpil vidalan se hota he
 Platyzoa include the association Platyhelminthes, the flattened worm
 mul rup se inhen sabase aadim prakaar ke dwiparshvi mana jaataa tha, lekin ab aisa mana jaataa he ki ve adhik jatil purvajon se viksit hue hai
 This group includes many parasites, such as the fluke and the lace worm
 chapate krimi aguhiy hote hai, inamen deh guha kaa abhaav hota he, jaisaa ki unke nikatatam sambandhi, sookshm jeev gestrotrica main hota he
 Other associations of Platyzoa consist mostly of microscopic and virtual celiac
 sabase pramukh hai rotiphera yaa rotiphers, jo jaleey vaataavaran main saamaanya hai
 These include Acanthocyphaella or sculp-topped worms, Gnathostomulida, Microbenthozoa, and possibly Cyclophora
 in samoohon main jatil jabade hote hai, jinaki vajah se ye gnethiphera kehalaate hai
 Both groups have long been thought to be closely related, as tricophore larvae are found in both, but Annelida was thought to be much closer to Arthropoda
 kyonki ve donon hi khandit hote hai
 It is generally considered convergent evolution, as there are many morphological and genetic differences between the two associations
 lophotrocojoa main nimertia yaa ribbon krimi, sipunkula bhi shaamil hai or kai sangh jinamein mukh ke chaaron ore pakshmabhika kaa ek pankhaa hota he, lofophor kehalaate hai
 These were traditionally grouped with Lofo forites
 lekin ab aisa prathit hota he ki ve peraphilatic hai, kuch nimertia ke najdiki hai ore kuch molska va enelida ke najdiki hai
 These include Brachiopoda or Lemp shells, which are prominent in fossil records, Entroprocata, Phoronida, and possibly Bryozoa or Moss fauna
 jantu main paayi jane vaali baari vividhta ke kaaran, vaigyanikon ke liye chaynit prajatiyon kii ek choti sankhya ko adhyayan karnaa adhik kifayati hota he, taaki is vishay par unke kaaryon ore nishkarshon se sambandh sthapit kiya ja sake ki jantu saamaanya rup se kis prakaar se kaary karte hai
 Because they are easy to keep and hybridize, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the nematode Canorhabditis elegans have long been widely studied specimen organisms and were among the first life forms to be genetically sequenced
 ise unke jinom kii bahut adhik apachayit avasthaa ke dwaara sahaj banaaya gaya, lekin yahan do dhar kii talwaar kai jino, introns or linkage lost ke saath he, ye ekadsojoa ke jeev saamaanya rup se jantuon kii utpatti ke bare main hamen thoda bahut sikhaa sakate hai
 The extent of this type of evolution within the ultimate association will be revealed through the genome project of Crustaceans, Annelids, and Mollusca, which is currently progressing
 starlet samudri anemon jinom ke vishleshan ne spanjon, placosoa or koenokashabhikiyon ke mahatva par jor daalaa he
 And they are also being sequenced in explaining the arrival of 1500 ancestral genes unique to Eumetazoa
 homosclaromorf spanj oskarela karmela kaa vishleshan bataata he ki spanj ke antim saamaanya purvaj or eumetazoa ke jantu purv kalpana se adhik jatil the
 Other modal organisms related to the animal world include the rat and zebrafish
 arastu ne sajiv duniya ko paudhon or jantuon main vibhajit kiya or iske baad kerolas linius ne pehla padanukramit vargeekaran kiya
 Since then, biologists have been emphasizing on the relationship of development and hence these groups have become somewhat restricted
 udhaaharan ke liye, sookshmdarsheey protojoa ko mul rup se jantu mana gaya kyonki ve gati karte hai, lekin ab unhen alag rakhaa jaataa he
 In the original plan of Linnaeus, animals were one of the three worlds, divided into classes of vermis, insecta, piesies, amphibia, avies, and memelia
 tab se aakhri ke chaar virgon ko ek hi sangh cordeta main rakhaa jaataa he, jabaki kai anya roopon ko alag kar diya gaya he

 There are three forms of this institution: isaki utpatti samajhane ke liye europe kii tatkaaleen paristhiti ko dhyaan main rakhana aavashyak he
 Officials of the Catholic religion were alert from the very beginning of the proper formulation of their religious beliefs and were able to protect them for centuries by explaining the propagators of misleading doctrines and excluding them from the religion as necessary
 chauthi shatabdi i
 main katholic dharm ko roman samrajya kii ore se manyata mili; baad main vah europe ke adhikansh deshon main bhi rajdharm ke rup main sweekrut hone laga
 Thus, rebellion against the Catholic religion was considered treason

 Towards the end of AD, the institution of Enquisition was established and later it spread to almost all Christian countries

 The accused were requested to abandon their misleading doctrine and repent
 jo log iske liye taiyaar nahin hote the, unako prandand dilaane ke liye sarkaar ke haath saunpa jaataa tha
 According to the barbaric practice of that time, the accused was also tortured by the accused

 For these reasons, historians have strongly condemned the Enquisition
 isaki sthapana san 1478 i

 The thing is that for some seven centuries, Muslim dominance over some regions of Spain and many Christians were predominantly Muslim
 duusari ore, raja ne spain ke yahudiyon ko yah aadesh diya ki isai bano athwa desh chhod do
 In this situation there was doubt about the new Christians of Spain whether they are Muslims or Jews inside

 Dashakumarcharit is a Sanskrit prose written by Dandi
 isamen dash kumaron kaa charit varnit hone ke kaaran iskaa naam "dashakumarcharit" he
 The discovery of the prose called "avantisundari Katha" composed by Dandi has further compounded the problem of Daskumarcharit
 ye vikalp upasthit hote hai ki kya dashakumarcharit or avantisundari katha donon ke rachayita dandi ek hi hai athwa bhinn-bhinn hai; or yadi in donon ke lekhak ek hi dandi maan liye jaaen, to kya ye donon gadhykavy ek duusare ke poorak hai athwa do swatantra gadhykavy hai
 Some scholars are in favor that the Avantisundari Katha is the lost part of the original Dasakumarcharit and both are the same prose
 vidwaanon kaa doosraa varg is vichaar se bilkul sahamat nahin he
 Dashakumarcharit's handwritten and published editions often have three parts - inamen se granth kaa madhya bhaag hi, jo aath uchhvaason main vibhakt he, dandi kii moulik kriti mana jaataa he, parantu kyonki inamen rajvahan kii asampurn katha evam saat mitron kii kathaayen hai at: vah asampurn he
 The remaining parts, ie, puratheetika and uttarpeethika are compositions of other authors, which have been added to the beginning and end of the original book respectively
 vidwaanon kii dharna he ki dandi ne pehle avashya purna granth kii rachana kii hogi, kintu baad main karanvash ve bhaag nasht ho gaye
 In the eight extracts of the original book of Dandi, only eight kumaras are told
 kintu purvapithika main di gai do kumaron kii katha milakar das kumaron kii sankhya puri ho jaati he
 Similarly, the incomplete Vishrit Charit mentioned in the eighth extract of the original book is completed in the Uttarapeethika
 bhoj ne apane saraswati kanthabharan main purvapithika kaa stuti shloke uddhrut kiya he
 So this part was in the eleventh century
 Must have already been joined
 uttarpithika ke kari sanskaran hai- ek chakrapani kaa, doosraa narayan kaa, or kuch bhaag padmanabh ke
 Because the things mentioned in the main story have found opposition at many places in the antechamber and antechamber, it is easy to prove the antecedent and antecedent
 udhaahrant: mukhya bhaag main arthpal tathaa pramati kampal ke putr hai jinaki maataaon ke naam kramash: kantimati tathaa taravali he, parantu purv-peethika main arthpal, taravali kaa putr he or pramati, sumati naamak mantri kaa
 Similarly, in the main part, the name of Vishruta's father is Sindhudatta, but in the foreground, his name is Padmodbhav
 punasch mukhya bhaag main rajkumaar rajkumaari ke anuj kii sahaayta se ant:poor main pravesh paata he parantu purvapithika main ek sahakaari vidyadhar kii sahaayta se
 Similarly, there are many opposition and opposition in the book

 From the third exorcism to the best exorcism, there are stories of the gifts Verma, Arthapal, Pramati and Mitragupta respectively
 tisare uchhavas main uphaar verma kii katha he
 He showed the right of Rajyapahari on the mind and suggested about the power of his amazing beauty
 is prakaar soundaryashakti ke bahaane se unki hatya kar di tathaa apane pita ke khoe hue rajya ko waapas liya
 In the fourth exile, Arthapal is said to have lost his father's lost mantripad and a princess named Manikarnika
 pancham uchhavas main pramati shravasti kii rajkumaari kaa panigrahan karata he
 In the description of Yuvraj's journey, many types of references to rural and civil life are found
 pashtha uchhavas main mitragupta ke dwaara khunh desh kii rajkumaari kii prapti kaa varnan he
 In this, Dandi has described the courage done on the sea
 saptam uchhavas main mantragupta kii katha he
 This feature of this sigh is remarkable in that the characters of the upper class from the lips have not been used due to the bite of the narrator's lips by his beloved
 ashtum uchhavas main vishrut ke saahasik kaaryo kaa varnan he jo vidarbha desh ke rajkumaar ko uskaa khoyaa hua rajya dilaataa he
 It has a sophisticated satire on political science

 Like a sudden start, the work ends here suddenly
 sanskrit sahitya main dashakumarcharit kaa anupam sthaan he
 In fact, this Sanskrit prose is very close to modern novels
 yah tatkaaleen samaaj kaa sarvangin yatharth chitra upasthit karata he
 Dashakumarcharit slyness is called complete poetry
 dyutkrida, send lagaana, chaalaaki, dhoortta, pravanchanaa, hinsa, hatya, jaalsaji, apharan evam avaidh prem ek-ek athwa samuhik rup main sab kathaon main milte hai
 The behavior of the writer towards society is very important
 brahran, sanyasi, raja, rajkumariyaan evam pavitra saadhuon kaa uphaas kiya gaya he
 The gods were also not released
 parantu iskaa uddeshy aniatikta kaa samarthan karnaa nahin he
 Their main aim is to analyze the false beliefs of the people and present them to the society
 mukhya kathavstu ko avaantar kathaon ke saath badi kushalta se piroyaa gaya he
 The flow of the story, which runs smoothly from the beginning to the end, is interesting and intriguing
 uplabdh pracheen sanskrit gadhykavyon main dandi kaa dashakumarcharit hi ek aisa gadhykavy he, jo saral evam swaabhaavik gadhy style main likhaa gaya he
 The characterization of Dandi is very impressive
 unhone marichi rishi, ganika kammanjari, tathaa dhatri shringaalika tathaa sipaahiyon ke afasar kantak ke jivan-chitra pradarshit kiye hai
 Humor and satire abound in the entertainment situations presented by the poet
 nissandeh dandi kaa bhashaa par adhikaar he parantu vah badha chadhaakar vastuon kaa varnan nahin karte or apni kavyakala kii praudhata kaa sookshm drushti se pradarshan kar pathak ke hriday par prabhaav daalate hai
 Sanskrit critics appreciate his excellent word beauty
 vidwaanon main yah prasiddh ukti prachlit he 'dandinah padlaalityam' or iske dandi adhikari bhi hai
 Fine use of alliteration produces pulsating amusing sound effects
 ve lambe samaason kaa prayog karte hai parantu arth kii vyakti main aspashtataa nahin aane dete
 Their narratives are impressive and heartwarming, but they keep the reader's heart attracted because there is an artistic balance between the use of their ornaments and the subject
 dandi ke padlaalitya ke udhaaharan rup prastut hai- Or is prakaar ke udhaaharan praaia: prachurya se milte hai or 'dandinah padlaalityam' kii ukti ko siddh karte hai
 Dandi's design is a matter of pride
 unki bhashaa main sukumaartha, parishkar, pranjalata, prasad or maadhurya gun praapt hote hai
 On reading Dasakumarcharit, the reader realizes that he is tasting some succulent composition
 jivan kii anubhutiyaan aankhon ke samaksh utar aati hai or vah kavi ko apana ek atarang mitra sa anubhav karata he
 There is neither a plan for 'pratyakshalya' like Subandhu nor an artificiality of the 'sarsasirvarnapada' like the arrow in Dandi's poetry
 usamen dainik vyavhaar kii pravaahashil bhashaa he
 Short words and sentences are visible, playing like novices and they suddenly attract the heart
 kathaon or upanyaason main prayukt manish style kaa isamen antarbhaav dikhta he
 The plausibility, sweetness and spontaneous beauty of the language give the feeling of plungibility even in the dull
 raja rajhans or unki patni basumati ke varnan main padlaalitya or maadhurya darshneey he : Jharsuguda is a district in the Indian state of Odisha
