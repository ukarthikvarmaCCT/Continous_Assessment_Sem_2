 niharika yaa nabula antartaarkeey madhyam main sthit aise antartaarkeey badal ko kehete hai jisamen dhul, hydrogen gas, helium gas or anya ynikrut plasma gaise upasthit hon
 In ancient times, "niharika" used to refer to any elaborate object seen in the astro
 akashganga se pare ki kisi bhi gallexi ko niharika hi kaha jaataa tha
 The names were later changed when it was discovered by Edwin Hubble's research
 udhaaharan ke liye andromeda gallexi ko pehle andromeeda nabula ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Stars and planetary circles are often born in nebulae, as seen in eagles
 yah niharika nasa dwaara khinche gaye "pilrs of kriyeshan" arthath "sristi ke stambh" naamak ati-prasiddh chitra main darshai gai he
 In these regions, the structures of gas, dust and other materials "mutually join together" to form large piles, which attract other substances and take a sufficiently large size to form stars, respectively

 "niharika" is spelled "nebula" in English
 yah ek latini bhashaa kaa shabd he or iskaa arth "badal" hua karata tha, jiskaa bahuvachan "nebyalai", "nebyale" yaa "nebyalas" he
 There is evidence that the Maya people knew about nebulae before the invention of the telescope

 On 26 November 1610 nicolas-claude Fabi de Piresque invented the Orion nebulae using a telescope
 1618 main jon beptist seast ne bhi is niharika kaa adhyayan kiya
 However, there was no detailed study of the Orion nebula before 1659, ie Christian Heijens, who considered himself the first to invent nebulae or this celestial mist
 1715 main, edmund heley ne chah niharikaon kii ek suchi prakashit kii

 nicholas lui di lacale ne 1751-53 main kep of good hope se 42 niharikaon kii suchi banaai
 jisamen se adhiktar pehle agyaat thim
 Charles Messier then made a list of 103 nebulae by 1781, though his main reason for doing so was to avoid misidentification of comets
 iske baad wiliam harchel or unki bahan caroline harchel kii koshishon se niharikaon kii sankhya main atyadhik ijapha hua
 His Catalog of One Thousand New Nebulai and Cluster of Stars was published in 1786
 The second list of one thousand was published in 1789 and the third and final list of 510 was published in 1802
 apane adhiktar kaam ke dauraan, wiliam harchel ko yah yakeen tha ki ye niharikaayen sitaron ke aviksit samooh maatr the
 However, in 1790, he discovered a star surrounded by ambiguity and concluded that it was an actual rainbow or nebula, rather than a large distance group
 1864 ke aarambh main, wiliam haggins ne lagbhag 70 niharikaon ke spectra yaa shrenee kii jaanch kii
 unhone paaya ki unamem se lagbhag ek tihaai main gas ke samavesh kii vistrut shrenee thi
 The rest appeared to have an ever-widening range and were considered a cluster of stars
 1912 main, jab vesto sleefer ne yah darshaya ki merope taare ke aasapaas kii niharikaon kii shrenee pliyedas khule taraguchh se milti he, tab inamen ek teesraa varg joda gaya
 Thus the nebula shines through the reflected light of the stars
 sleefer or edwin habal ne anek visarit niharikaon se inaki vistrut shreniyon ko ekatra karnaa jari rakhaa tathaa pataa lagaaya ki inamen se 29 utsarjan spectra dikhaate hai or 33 main taron ke prakaash kaa satat spectra tha
 In 1922, Hubble announced that almost all the nebulae are associated with stars, and that their light comes from starlight
 unhone yah bhi pataa lagaaya ki utsarjan spectrum kii niharikaayen lagbhag hameshaa B1 yaa usase adhik garm se judy rahati hai, jabaki satat spectra yukt niharikaayen apekshaakrit thande taron ke saath prakat hoti hai
 Both Hubble and Henry Norris Russell conclude that the nebulae surrounding the hot stars are changing in some way
 anek niharikaon kaa gathan antartaarkeey madhyam main gas ke aapasi gurutvkarshan kii vajah se hota he
 Due to the constriction of matter under its own weight, many massive stars can be formed in the center and their ultraviolet light ionizes the surrounding gases and makes them visible on light waves
 rojet nebyal or pelicon nebyal is prakaar kii niharikaon ke udhaaharan hai
 The size of these types of nebulae, known as the HII region, depends on the size of the actual clouds of gas
 yahi vah jagah hai jahaan sitaron kaa gathan hota he
 The stars formed from it are sometimes referred to as a young, loose cluster
 kuch niharikaon kaa gathan supernova main honevaale visphot arthath vishaal or alp-jivi taron ke ant ke parinamswarup hota he
 The material disintegrated by the explosion of a supernova is ionized by energy and this causes the formation of a solid object to be formed
 vrish taramandal kaa craib nebyal iskaa sravshreshth udhaaharan he
 In the year 1054 a supernova incident was recorded and marked as SN1054
 visphot ke baad nirmit thos vastu craib nebyal ke kendra main sthit he or yah ek neutron star he
 Other nebulae may constitute planetary nebulae
 prithvi ke suraj kii tarah, yah lo-maas arthath dravyaman taare ke jivan kaa antim charan he
 Stars with 8–10 solar masses develop as red demon stars and gradually lose their deafening layer during pulsing in their atmosphere
 jab ek tara paryaapt saamagree kho detaa he, tab iskaa taapmaana badhata he or isse utsarjit parabangnee vikiran iske dwaara aasapaas phenke hue nebyal ko ynit kar saktaa he
 The nebula contains 97% hydrogen and 3% helium, including residual content
 is charan kaa mukhya lakshya santulan praapt karnaa he
 The nebulae are classified into four major groups
 pehle gallexion or gol taragucchon ko bhinn prakaar kii niharikayen samajha jaataa tha
 Spherical nebulae were used to explain the spherical structure of galaxies
 is vargeekaran main badal jaisi sabhi gyaat sanrachanaayen shaamil nahin hai
 One example of which is the herbig-haro object
 sitaron ke paas kii visarit niharikaayen pratibimb niharika kaa udhaaharan hai
 Most nebulae can be called diffuse nebulae, which means they are elaborate and do not fall within the limits of any common definition
 dikhaai dene yogya roshni main in niharikaon ko utsarjan niharika or pratibimb niharikaamein vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he, jo is baat par aadhaarit he ki hamen dikhaai denevaale prakaash kii rachana kis tarah hui he
 The emission nebula consists of imported gases, which form a blurred line of emission
 in utsarjan niharikaon ko aksar HII kshetra kaha jaataa he, "HII" shabd kaa upyog vyavsaayik khagol vigyaan main aksar ynit hydrogen ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Compared to emission nebulae, reflection nebulae themselves do not form sufficient visible light lines, but rather reflect the light of their surrounding stars
 andhri yaa gahari niharikaayen visarit niharikaon jaisi hi hai, lekin unhen unke dwaara utsarjit yaa prativimbit prakaash dwaara nahin dekha ja saktaa
 iske bajaae, unhen dur ke taron yaa utsarjan niharikaon ke saamne ke gahare badalon ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Although these nebulae appear differently on light waves, they are bright sources of emission on all infrared or infrared waves
 yah utsarjan mukhyatah niharikaon ke bheetar kii dhul se aata he
 Planetary nebulae are nebulae formed from a gas-rich shell emanating from a low-moss asymptomatic massive branch star when it turns into a white dwarf
 ye niharikaayen, dhundhale utsarjan yukt utsarjit niharikaayen hai jo sitaron ke nirmaan kshetron main pai janevaali utsarjan niharikaon jaisi hoti hai
 Technically, these are HII regions because most will be hydrogen ionized
 haalanki, grahon kii niharikaayen adhik ghani evam sitaron ke nirmaan kshetron main pai janevaali utsarjan niharikaon kii apeksha adhik thos hoti hai
 Planetary nebulae have been given this name because the first astronomers who studied these objects thought that nebulae resembled the planets or discs of the planets, however, they are not related to planets
 ek proto planetary nebyal ek khagoleey vastu he, jo bhootpurv ananthasparshi vishaal shakha kii sthiti or uske baad ke grahon kii niharika ke charan ke bich ek taare ke twarit taarakeey kramik vikaas kaa alpakaaleen prakaran he
 a PPN emits strong infrared radiation and is a reflection nebula
 ek PPN ke grahon kii niharika banane ke vaastavik bindu ko kendriya sitare ke taapmaana dwaara paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 a supernova occurs when a high-moss star reaches the end of its life
 jab sitare ke mul yaa centre main parmaanu sanlayan band ho jaataa he, tab sitara vighatit ho jaataa he
 The leaking gas either rebounds or becomes so hot that it spreads out from the center and causes an explosion of stars
 gas kaa failaa hua khol, ek vishesh prakaar ke visarit niharika supernova avshesh kii rachana karata he
 Although most of the light and X-ray emission of the supernova residue originates from ionized gas, the bulk of the radio emission is non-thermal emission known as synchrotron emission
 yah utsarjan chumbakeey kshetron main dolyman ucch-veg yukt electronon se utpann hota he
 Kunwar Billy Arjan Singh was a world renowned tiger conservationist and environmentalist

 In British India, by taking up residence on the river Suheli near the north-kheri forest division, they continued to fight against the poachers and corrupt government machinery in the protection of wildlife

 She was named Billy by her aunt, Amrit Kaur, who was the secretary of Mahatma Gandhi and the first woman health minister in the Nehru government, her education took place in the British Raj, her father in the Balrampur princely state was given the court-office by the British Ward was appointed, so his childhood was spent in the princely state of Balrampur
 balrampur ke jangalon main inke shikaar ke kisse mashhoor rahe or 12 varsh kii aayu main hi inhone baagh kaa shikaar kiya
 Being the son of a royal family and a great officer, he achieved a high status and joined the british-indian Army, after the Second World War, he made sure to make the Kheri forests a shelter
 purv main inaki riyasat kii tamaam sampattiyaan khiri va baharich main rahi thim jinhen angrejon ne inke purakhon ko riward ke taur par di thi
 After the Second World War, Billy made the forests of Kheri his home and lived here for fifty years and made his matchless contribution to wildlife conservation, which is an example in the whole world today
 billy jivan paryant dudhwa neshnal park ke onreri wildlife warden rahe
 Billy, who was a member of the UP Wildlife Board and the Indian Wildlife Board, was in close association with Mrs Gandhi, who has dedicated his book to tara-a Tigress, Mrs Indira Gandhi
 lakhimpur khiri main palia ke nikat sthit jasvir nagar farm par billy arjan singh kaa nidhan 1 janvari 2010 ko hua
 Billy was 93 at this time
 1960 main billy kii jeep ke saamne ek tendua gujara andhenri raat main jeep kii roshni main uski sundarata ne billy kaa man moh liya, ye prakruti kii sundarata thi jise arjan singh ne mahasoos kiya !! isi vakt unhone shikaar ko tilanjali de di
 The determination to live and cultivate in the middle of the forests in Kheri was the first step of Dudhwa National Park to come into existence
 1946 main apane pita ke naam par jasvir nagar farm kaa sthapit karnaa or fir 1968 main tiger haven kaa, yah pehla sanket tha niyati kaa ki ab khiri ke yah van apana vajood barkaraar rakh sakege, nahin to aaazaad bharat main angrejon dwaara sthantarit kiye gayi shakhu ke vishaal van betahasha kaate ja rahe the, jaahir si baat he hamane aazaadee to le lee thi kintu hamaari nirbharta prakritik sansadhano par hi thi or shaayad aaj bhi he! indira ji kii vajah se hi tiger haven main baaghon va tenduon ke punarvaasan kaa prayog sambhav hua
 This was a period when film makers from across the country and abroad were competing for who would make their best documentary on these unique experiments of Billy
 bharat ke kisi bhi abhayaarany kii charchaa itani nahin thi jitani billy ke is privet faresti kii thi jise sari duniya tiger haven ko jaanati he
 After the Second World War, this international figure, Billy Arjan Singh, left the british-indian Army, made the vast jungles of Kheri a great one and gave it a beautiful result, which we know today as Dudhwa National Park
 shuruwati dinon main palia se sampoornanagar jane vaali sadak par apane pita jasvir singh ke naam par ek farm house kaa nirmaan kiya or kheti ko apana jariya banaaya
 Once a hunter, Billy, riding in his forest one day, entered the forest and was stunned to see the middle part of the Suheli and Nevara rivers, covered with incomparable natural beauty, the earth around which extended forests of shaku
 yahi vah ghadi thi jisane tiger haven ke pradurbhaav kaa nishchay kar diya tha
 This forest was purchased by Billy in 1969 AD, with saritas in the south-north and dense forests in the west-east
 or yahan baaghon or tenduon ke liye tiger haven kii sthapana kii
 Due to the continuous efforts of Arjan Singh, Dudhwa National Park was started in 1977 and then the Tiger Project was started and Dudhwa Tiger Reserve was established in 1988 by combining Dudhwa National Park and Kishanpur Wildlife Vihar
 tiger haven se sate sathiana renj ke jangalon main barasinha ke awaas he jise sangrakshit karwaane main billy kaa yogadan vismaraneey he
 Arjan Singh always kept saying that wild-life should be separated from forest department and made a separate department, wild-life department! Because at that time, the forest department was more in the attempt to cut down the forest than to save it, the government was treating the forests by timber mafia
 yadi yah alag vibhaag bana diya jaay to isamen shaamil hone vaale log vanya-jivan kii visheshgyata hasil karke aayenge
 The broken chains of forests were a matter of concern for Billy, because the tigers are very large and if the forests shrink, the tigers will also become less! In this once inaccessible area, "the Collective Farms and Forest Limited cleared 10,000 hectares of forested land and people migrated from Pakistan and later settled in Bhoodan Andolan
 Turned into fields
 or dudhwa jangal kaa van-tapu main tabdeel ho gaya
 Which always annoyed Billy
 aazaadee ke baad jis tarah is junglee kshetra main logon ne ruukh kiya or van-bhoomi ko krishi bhumin main tabdeel karte chale gayi vahi vajah ab baaghon or anya jeevon ke astitv ko mitaa rahi he
 It was because of his desire to have more protected areas for tigers that the Kishanpur wildlife sanctuary came into existence, which is now a part of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve
 gym corbett or eff0 dblue0 champion se prabhavit billy arjan singh ne aath pustake likhi jo uttar bharat kii is van-shrankhla kaa behtareen lekha-jokha hai
 The work done by Billy Arjan Singh to trend the cubs of tigers and leopards by rehabilitating them in their natural habitat i
e
 in the forest is unique in the whole world
 prince, heriet or juliet inke teen tendue the jo jangal main puri tarah punervasit hue, baad main englad ke chidyaghar se laai gayi baghin tara bhi dudhwa ke wanon ko apana baseraa banane main safal hui
 The result is the generation of Tara which is flourishing in the forests of Dudhwa
 billy ko tara ke siberian yaa anya naslon kaa mila-jula hona bataakar badnaam karne kii koshish kii or ise naam diya "anuvanshik pradooshan" jabaki anuvashik vigyaan ke mutabik bhugolic simaaon va vibhinn vaataavaraniya kshetron main rahane vaali jatiyon kaa aapas main sambadh hanikaarak nahin hota he balki behatar hota hai
 If that were the case, no British would establish matrimonial relations in any Asian country, nor any Asian or American
 bhartiya parampara main bhi samgotreey vaivaahik sambadh amaanya he or vigyaan kii drushti main bhi, fir kaise siberian yani rus kii nasl vaali is baghin kaa bharat ke baaghon se sambadh anuvashik pradooshan hai
 In order to avoid the dangers of in-breeding, they establish relationships between organisms of different communities so that their gene-diversity is maintained and Billy thus established this diversity among the tigers of Dudhwa
 dudhwa main tara kii vashanwali nirantar sanmriddh ho rahi he, dudhwa ke baaghon main indo-siberian nasl kii upasthit ko ek vaigyanik santhaan bhi maan chukaa he, kintu adhikarik taur par ise maanane main intjamiyaan dar rahi he
 It has been proved that tigers in Dudhwa forest are strengthening this breed with gene diversity of siberian-royal Bengal tiger
 is anuvanshik vivadhita ke kaaran bhartiya baaghon kii nasl ab or behatar hogi
 Otherwise, these tigers in the jungles of the shrunk forests would maintain a relationship 


 in the same gene pool 


 and in-breeding would weaken their breed
 or tab hota anuvashik pradooshan! Kunwar Billy Arjan Singh did his primary education at Finder Smith College, Nainital, did secondary education at Christian College Lucknow and graduated from English at Allahabad University

 Jawaharlal Nehru joined the Home Rule League in 1917

 He resigned in 1926 citing lack of cooperation from the British authorities
 1926 se 1928 tak, jawahar laal nehru ne akhil bhartiya congress samiti ke mahasachiv ke rup main seva kii
 In 1928-29, the annual session of the Congress was held under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru
 us satr main jawaharlal nehru or subhash chandra bose ne puri raajnneetik swatantraaa kii maang kaa samarthan kiya, jabaki motilal nehru or anya netaaon ne british samrajya ke bheetar hi prabhutv sampann rajya kaa darja paane kii maang kaa samarthan kiya
 To resolve the issue, Gandhi took a middle ground and said that Britain would be given two years to grant the status of the state of India and if it did not, the Congress would launch a national struggle for complete political independence
 nehru or bose ne maang kii ki is samay ko kam kar ke ek saal kar diya jaae
 The British government did not respond to this
 disambar 1929 main, congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan lahore main yojit kiya gaya jisamen jawaharlal nehru congress party ke adhyaksh chune gaye
 During this session, a resolution was also passed demanding 'complete self-rule'

 Gandhiji also called for the Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930
 andolan khaasaa safal rahaa or isane british sarkaar ko pramukh raajnneetik sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa ko sweekaar karne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 When the British Government promulgated the India Act 1935, the Congress Party decided to contest elections
 nehru chunaav ke baahar rahe lekin zoron ke saath party ke liye rashtravyapee abhiyaan chalaaya
 The Congress formed governments in almost every province and won the largest number of seats in the Central Assembly

 When India got independence in 1947, when the Congress voted for the future Prime Minister, Sardar Patel got the most votes
 uske baad sarvaadhik mat acharya kriplani ko mili the

 1947 main ve swatantra bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri bane
 The British had liberated around 500 princely states together and the biggest challenge at that time was to bring them under one flag

 Nehru also extended a hand of friendship towards China, but in 1962, China attacked by deception
 nehru ke liye yah ek bada jhatka tha or shaayad unki maut bhi isi kaaran hui

 bahut se logon kaa vichaar he ki nehru ne anya netaaon kii tulana main bharat ke swatantrata sangram main bahut kam yogadan diya tha phir bhi gandhiji ne unhe bharat kaa pratham pradhanmantri bana diya
 For several decades after independence, the heirs of power in Indian democracy have run a monarchy in the country from time to time, revered individual worship in place of ideology and completely neglected the public interest while indulging in the aura of so-called popularity
 nehru ko mahatma gandhi ke raajnneetik uttaradhikari ke taur janaa jaataa he
 It is also alleged on Gandhi that he did the work of advancing Nehru in politics at the expense of many able leaders including Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 jab aazaadee ke thik pehle congress adhyaksh banane kii baat thi or mana ja rahaa tha ki jo congress adhyaksh banegaa vahi aaazaad bharat kaa pehla pradhanmantri hoga tab bhi gandhi ne pradesh congress samitiyon kii siforeeshon ko andekha karte hue nehru ko hi adhyaksh banane kii disha main safaltaapurvak prayaas kiya
 This creates a general belief that Nehru must have not only done the work of advancing the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi but he must have tried his best to complete the tasks which Gandhi himself could not complete
 lekin sachai iske ulat he
 It was none other than Jayaprakash Narayan, who once worked as a team with Nehru, in the role of 1978 book 'gandhi Today'
 jepi ne nehru ke bare main kuch kaha he to uski vishwasaneeyata ko lekar koi andeh nahin hona chahie kyonki nehru se jepi kii najdiki bhi thi or mitrataa bhi
 Despite this, JP highlighted the shortcomings of the Nehru model
 april 2015 main yah bhi khulaasa hua ki swatantraaa ke baad nehru ne bees varshon tak ibi dwaara netaji ke sambandhiyon kii jasusi karaayi
 Away from all political controversies, Nehru was undoubtedly a good writer

 The areas of both are different, but there is a considerable amount of consistency in the writing of both

 As a result, the books composed by him also give a simple feeling of being the creation of a study-able person
 nehru ji ne vyavasthit rup se anek pustakon kii rachana kii he

 Kasturba Gandhi was born like Mahatma Gandhi on 11 April 1869 in Porbandar Nagar, Kathiawar
 is prakaar kasturba gandhi aayu main gandhi ji se 6 maas badi thim
 Kasturba Gandhi's father 'gokuldas Makanji' was an ordinary businessman
 gokuldaas makanji kii kasturba teesri santan thim
 At that time, no one used to teach girls, marriage was also done in a short time
 isliye kasturba bhi bachapan main nirakshar thim or saat saal kii avasthaa main 6 saal ke mohandas ke saath unki sagaai kar di gai
 They were both married at the age of thirteen
 baapu ne un par aarambh se hi ankush rakhane kaa prayaas kiya or chaha ki kasturba bina unase anumati liye kahin na jaaen, kintu ve unhen jitna dabaate utana hi ve azaadi leti or jahaan chaahatin chali jaatin
 The husband and wife lived together almost till 1888 AD, but after Bapu's stay in England, for the next twelve years, the two were often separated
 england pravaas se lautne ke baad sheeghra hi baapu ko africa chalaa janaa padaa
 When he came to India in 1896, he took Ba along with him
 tab se ba baapu ke pad kaa anugaman karti raheen
 He had made his life as simple as that
 ve baapu ke dharmik evam deshseva ke mahavraton main sadaiv unke saath raheen
 This is the essence of all his life
 baapu ke anek upwaason main ba praaia: unke saath raheen or unki saar sanbhaal karti raheen
 When Bapu started fasting in Yerwada jail in 1932 on the question of Harijans, Ba was in Sabarmati jail
 us samay ve bahut baichaiyn ho uthin or unhen tabhi chaiyn mila jab ve yarvada jail bheji garin
 The rites of religion were deeply ingrained in Ba
 ve kisi bhi avasthaa main maance or sharaab lekar manus deh bhrasht karne ko taiyaar na thim
 He refused to drink meat broth even in a state of difficult disease in Africa and persevered for a lifetime
 dakshin africa main 1913 main ek aisa kanoon paas hua jiske anusaar isai mat ke anusaar kiye gaye or vivaah vibhaag ke adhikari ke yahan darj kiye gaye vivaah ke atirikt anya vivaahon kii manyata agrahya kii gai thi
 In other words, marriages of Hindus, Muslims, Parsis etc
 were declared illegal and the status of such married women became more like a mistress than a wife
 baapu ne is kanoon ko rad karaane kaa bahut prayaas kiya
 But when they did not succeed, then they decided to do Satyagraha and called upon women to join it
 par is baat kii charchaa unhone anya striyon se to kii kintu ba se nahin kii
 He did not want Ba to go to the satyagrahis at his behest and then present a difficult situation after falling into difficulties
 ve chaahate the ki ve swechhaya jaayan or jaayan to drudh rahen
 When Ba saw that Bapu did not talk to him about taking part in the Satyagraha, he became very sad and gave a blessing to Bapu
 phir swechhaya satyagrah main sammilit hui or teen anya mahilaon ke saath jail garin
 The food he got in the jail was inedible, so he decided to make fruit
 kintu jab unke is anurodh par koi dhyaan nahin diya gaya to unhone upwas karnaa aarambh kar diya
 On the fifth day, officers had to bow down
 kintu jo fal die gaye vah puure bhojan ke liye paryaapt na the
 So Ba had to stay in jail for three months on half stomach food
 jab ve jail se chhutin to unka sharir thathri maatr rah gaya tha
 Except for going to jail in South Africa, he probably did not participate in any public work there, but after coming to India, Bapu shared all the tasks he took, like an experienced soldier
 champaran ke satyagrah ke samay ba bhi tiharva gram main rahakar gaanvon main gumti or dawa vitaran karti raheen
 In this work, the white people got a sense of politics
 unhone ba kii anupasthiti main unki jhopadi jalawaa di
 Children used to study in that hut of Ba
 apni yah chatshaala ek din ke liye bhi band karnaa unhen pasand na tha at: unhone sari raat jagakar ghaas kaa ek doosraa jhopra khadaa kiya
 Similarly, at the time of Kheda Satyagraha, women wandered around and encouraged them
 1922 main jab baapu giraftaar kiye gaye or unhen chah saal kii sajaa hui us samay unhone jo vaktavy diya vah unhen virangana ke rup main pratishthit karata he
 He called upon the people to abandon foreign clothes to protest against Gandhiji's arrest
 baapu kaa sandesh sunaane naujavaanon kii tarah gujarat ke gaanvon main gumti phirin
 In the days of Dandi Cooch and Dharasana's raid in 1930, Bapu continued to fill Bapu's absence in a way
 ve police ke atyaacharon se peedit janata kii sahaayta karti, dhairya bandhaati phirin
 He spent most of 1932 and 1933 in jail
 1939 main rajkot ke thakur sahab ne praja ko katipay adhikaar dena sweekaar kiya tha kintu baad main mukar gaye
 The public decided to do Satyagraha to express their protest against it
 ba ne jab yah suna to unhen laga ki rajkot unka apana ghar he
 It is their duty to participate in the Satyagraha to be held there
 unhone iske liye baapu kii anumati praapt kii or ve rajkot pahonchte hi savinay avagya ke abhiyog main najarband kar lee garin
 First he was kept in a secluded village in Sunsan where the atmosphere was not favorable to him at all
 janata ne andolan kiya ki unka swasthya thik nahin he, unhen chikitsa kii suvidha se dur rakhana ammanushik he
 As a result, she was kept in a palace, 10–15 miles from Rajkot
 ba ke jane ke kuch samay baad baapu ne bhi satyagrah main bhaag lene kaa nishchay kiya or vahaan pahunchakar upwas aarambh kiya
 When Ba got the news of this, he decided to have a meal at one time
 baapu ke upwas ke samay ve sadaiv hi aisa karti thim
 Two or three days later, the Rajkot government, forgetting that they could go to meet Bapu, sent them to Bapu
 kintu jab shaam ko koi unhen najarbandi ke sthaan par waapas le jane nahin aayaa tab pataa chalaa ki is chalaave se unhen reeha kiya gaya he
 Bapu did not tolerate this
 unhone ba ko ek baje raat ko jail waapas bheja
 The Rajkot government did not dare to let them stay on the road all night
 ve waapas rajmahal le jaai gayin or uske baad duusare din ve baqayada reeha kii gayin
 After Bapu Adi was arrested on 9 August 1942, Ba decided to give a speech in the meeting at Shivaji Park, where Bapu himself was going to give a speech, but was arrested when he reached the gate of the park
 do din baad ve puna ke aagaa khan mahal main bhej di garin
 Bapu was already arrested and sent there
 us samay ve aswasth thim
 On 15 August, when Mahadev Desai suddenly did Mahaprayana, why did he keep saying Mahadev again and again; Why not me? Later, the shrine of Mahadev Desai became like a temple to shankar-mahadev for him

 The General Packet Radio Service is a packet-oriented mobile data service, available to users in the 2G Cellular Communication System's Global System of Mobile Communications, as well as 3G systems
 2G pranali main, GPRS, 56-114 kbit / s kaa data dar pradaan karata he
 For GPRS data transfers, it is usually charged per megabyte of transferred traffic, while data communication via traditional circuit switching is payable per minute of combination time, regardless of whether the user is actually Is using capacity or is in a passive state
 GPRS ek sarvshereshth prayaas packet switchd seva he, circuit swimming ke vipareet, jisamen gaiyr mobile upyogkartaaon ke liye conection ke dauraan ek nishchit seva kii gunvattta, kii guarantee di jaati he
 The 2G cellular system, combined with GPRS, is often described as 2
5G, ie, a technology between the second and third generation of mobile telephony
 It provides medium-speed data transfer using unused time division multiple access channels, for example GSM systems
 Originally, there was also the idea of extending other standards while extending GPRS, but instead those networks are being changed to use the GSM standard, so that GSM is the only network where GPRS is used
 
 GPRS ko GSM release 97 or nae release main ekikrut kiya gaya he
 Originally it was standardized by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, but now by the Third Generation Partnership Project
 GPRS ko, purv ke CDPD or i-mod packet switchd praudyogiki kii ek GSM pratikriya ke rup main viksit kiya gaya
 GPRS extends GSM circuit switched data capabilities and makes the following services possible: yadi GPRS par SMS istemaal kiya jaataa he, to 30 SMS prati minute kii ek SMS sancharan gati praapt kii ja sakati he
 This is faster than using ordinary SMS on GSM, which has a transmission speed of 6 to 10 SMS per minute
 GPRS nimnlikhit protocol kaa samarthan karata he: When TCP / IP is used, one or more than one IP address can be allocated to each phone
 GPRS, cell hastantaran ke dauraan, IP packet ko sangruhit or phone ko agreshit karegaa 
 TCP kisi bhi packet kshati ko sambhalata he jiske parinamswaroop sancharan kii gati main ek asthaayee pravaah-roak hoti he
 Devices that support GPRS are divided into three classes: ek hi samay main do alag aavritiyon par prasaarit karne ke liye, ek sachche varg a upkaran kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he or is tarah do radio kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 To avoid this costly requirement, a GPRS mobile can implement dual transfer mode
 ek dtm-sakasham mobile, ek saath dhwani or packet data kaa upyog kar saktaa he, jahaan network yah sunishchit karne ke liye samanvay karata he ki ek hi samay main do alag aavritiyon par prasaarit karnaa aavashyak nahin he
 Such mobiles are considered pseudo-class A, sometimes specifying them as "common class A"
 2007 main kuch networkon dwaara DTM samarthan kii ummid he
 USB GPRS modems use a terminal-like interface USB 2
0 and later data formats V
42bis and RFC 1144 and also external antennas
 The modem can be attached as a card or as an external USB device, whose shape and size is similar to a computer mouse
 aplod or downlod gati, jo GPRS main praapt kii ja sakati he, kai karkon par nirbhar karti he jaise: The least robust, but fastest, coding scheme is available near a base transceiver station, while the strongest coding scheme is used when the mobile station is further away from the BTS
 CS-4 kaa upyog karte hue, 20
0 kbit / s prati time slot kii upyogkarta gati ko praapt karnaa sambhav he
 However, cell coverage has been 25% of normal in using this scheme
 CS-1, 8
0 kbit / s prati time slot kii upyogkarta gati ko praapt kar saktaa he, lekin iske paas saamaanya kawarej kaa 98% he
 Relatively new network devices can automatically optimize transfer speeds based on mobile location
 GPRS ke alaava, do anya GSM praudyogiki maujuud hai, jo data sevaaon ko pradaan karti he: circuit-switchd data or hai speed circuit-switchd data 
 GPRS ke saajha swabhaav ke vipareet, ye balki ek samarpit paripath kii sthapana karte hai 
 kuch anuprayog, jaise video phone, HSCSD ko pasand kar sakate hai, vishesh rup se jab antim chhoron ke bich data kaa ek satat pravaah he
 The following table presents some possible configurations of GPRS and circuit switched data services
 GPRS ke saath GPS main prayukt bahu abhigam paddati, frequency division duplex or TDMA par aadhaarit he
 During a session, a user is assigned a pair of up-link and down-link frequency channels
 yah time domen sankhyikeey bahusanketan ke saath sanyukt hota he, yani, packet mod sanchaar, jo kai upyogkartaaon dwaara ek hi frequency channel saajha karne ko sambhav banaata he
 Packets have a constant length according to a GSM time slot
 down-link, pehle-aao pehle-paao packet anusuchan kaa upyog karata he, jabaki ap-link kaafii had tak aarakshan ALOHA jaisi pranali kaa upyog karata he
 This means that the slotted ALOHA is used for reservation queries during a contention phase and then the actual data is transferred with first-come first-served scheduling using dynamic TDMA
 ek GPRS sangyojan apane acces point nem ke sandarbh dwaara sthapit hota he
 It defines services such as wireless application protocol access, short message service, multimedia messaging and Internet communication services such as email and the World Wide Web
 ek wireles modem hetu ek GPRS sangyojan sthapit karne ke liye, upyogkarta ke liye ek APN nirdisht karnaa aavashyak he, vaikalpik rup se ek upyogkarta naam or password or kadaachit hi ek IP pataa, sabhi network oparator dwaara pradutt
 The maximum speed of a GPRS connection introduced in 2003 was the same as a modem connection in an analog wire telephone network, 32–40 kbit / S, depending on the phone used
 Latency is too long; The round trip time is typically 600–700 ms
 And often reaches 1 sec
 GPRS ko vishisht rup se vaak se kam praathamikta di jaati he or is tarah conection kii gunvattta main bahut bhinnata hoti he
 Devices with latency / RTT correction are generally available
 iske alaava, kuch operataron ke paas suvidhaon kaa network unnayan bhi uplabdh he
 With these enhancements the active round-trip time can be reduced, resulting in a significant increase in throughput speed at the application level

 Metabolism is the chemical reactions that occur in living organisms
 ye prakriyaayein jeevon ko badhane or prajnan karne, apni rachana ko banaae rakhane or unke paryaavaran ke prati sajag rahane main madad karti hai
 Metabolism is generally divided into two types
 apachay carbonic padaarthon kaa vighatan karata he, udaa
 koshikeey shwasan se urja kaa utpaadan
 upachay urja kaa prayog karke proteinon or nabhikeey amlon jaise koshikaon ke anshon kaa nirmaan karata he
 Chemical reactions of metabolism operate in metabolic pathways, in which one chemical is converted to another chemical in a few steps by a series of enzymes
 anzime chayapachay ke liye mahatvapurn hote hai, kyonki ve jeevon ko aisi apekshit pratikriyaayein, jinamein urja kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or jo swatah nahin ghat sakati hai, unhen un swatah hone vaali pratikriyaaon ke saath yugal rup main hone main madad karte hai, jinase urja utpann hoti he
 Since enzymes act as catalysts, they allow these reactions to take place rapidly and reasonably
 anzime koshika ke paryaavaran main parivartanon yaa anya koshikaon se praapt sanketon ke anusaar chayapachayee margon ke niyantran main bhi sahaayta karte hai
 The metabolism of an organism determines which substance will be nutritious for it and which is toxic
 For example, some prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide, while this gas is toxic to animals
 chayapachay kii gati, yaa chayapachay dar is baat ko bhi prabhavit karti he ki kisi jeev ko kitne bhojan kii jarurat hogi
 a special feature of metabolism is that even if there are large differences in the species, their basic metabolic pathways and fractions are the same
 udaa
 citric acid chakra main madhyamik bhoomika nibhaane vaale carbaxylic acid, eckoshikeey bacteria eshcharishia coli se lekar haathiyon jaise vishaal bahukoshikeey jeevon tak, sabhi main paae jate hai
 These distinct metabolic similarities are probably due to the high efficiency of these pathways and their early appearance in developmental history
 jaanwaron, paudhon or sookshmjivon ko banane vaali adhikansh rachanaaen anuon ke teen mul virgon se bani hoti hai-amino acid, carbohydrate or lipid 
 chunki ye anu jivan ke liye mahatvapurn hote hai, isaliye chayapachayee pratikriyaayein koshikaon or utakon ke nirmaan ke samay in anuon ko banane, yaa bhojan ke pachan or prayog main unhen vighatit karne va unhen urja ke strot ke rup main upyog main laane main juty hoti hai

 Carbohydrates are the most commonly found organic molecules and play many roles, such as the accumulation and transport of energy and the creative parts
 The basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides, which include galactose, fructose, and most importantly, glucose
 monosacride aapas main judakar lagbhag aseemit rup se policecridon kaa nirmaan kar sakate hai
 DNA and RNA polymers are long chains of nucleotides
 ye anu pratilipikaran or protein jaivasanshleshan kii prakriyaaon ke jariye jin-sambandhi jaankaree ke sanchayan or prayog ke liye aavashyak hote hai
 This information is protected by DNA repair processes and transmitted by DNA replication
 kuch viruson jaise echivi main arene jinom hota he, jo ulte pratilipikaran kaa prayog karke apane viral arene jinom se diene saanche kaa nirmaan karata he
 The RNA of ribozyme such as spliceosomes and ribosomes is similar to that of enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions
 newcliosida riboj sugar se nabhikeey aadhaaron ke judane se banate hai
 These bases are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic rings, classified into purines or pyrimidines
 newcliotide chayapachayee samooh antaran pratikriyaaon main sahaenzimon kaa kaam bhi karte hai
 Metabolism involves a large number of chemical reactions, but most of them are a few basic types of reactions that occur for the transfer of working groups
 is aam rasayanakriya ke kaaran koshikaaye vibhinn pratikriyaaon ke bich rasaynic samoohon kaa vahan karne ke liye chayapachayee madhyasthon ke chote se samooh kaa istemaal karti hai
 These group-transfer intermediaries are called coenzymes
 samooh-antaran kii prayek kaksha ek vishesh sahaenzime dwaara kii jaati he, jo use utpann karne vaale or uskaa upyog karne vaale anzimon ke set kaa sabstrate hota he
 That is why these coenzymes are constantly being made, used and repeated again
 ek kendriya sahaenzime he, adinosin tryphosphate, jo koshikaon kii sarvyaapee urja mudra he
 This nucleotide is used to transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions
 koshikaon main atipi choti si maatra main hota he, lekin chunki yah lagaataar banataa rahata he, isaliye maanav sharir din bhar main lagbhag apane bhaar ke baraabar atipi kaa prayog kar saktaa he
 ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism, in which catabolic reactions produce ATP and anabolic reactions use it
 yah phophorilikaran pratikriyaaon main phosphate samoohon ke vaahak ke rup main bhi kaary karata he
 Vitamin is an organic compound required in small amounts, which cannot be made by cells
 In human nutrition, most vitamins act as coenzymes after modification, e
g
 all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated at the time of use in cells or are coupled to nucleotides
 vitamin bi3 kaa ek yogic, nicotinemide adinin dineucliotide, ek mahatvapurn sahaenzime he, jo hydrogen graahak kaa kaam karata he
 Hundreds of different types of dehydrogenase decompose NAD + into NADH by removing electrons from their substrates, this degraded type of coenzyme acts as a substrate for any of the reductases of cells that have to decompose their substrates
 nicotinamide adinin dineucliotide koshikaon main do sambandhit prakaaron main paaya jaataa he, enediech or enedipiech
 NADP+ / NADPH prakaar apachayi pratikriyaaon ke liye adhik aavashyak hota he, jabaki NAD+ / NADH kaa prayog upachayi pratikriyaaon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Inorganic elements play an important role in metabolism
 inamen se kuch to bahutayat main paae jate hai, jabaki anya maheen matraaon main kaam karte hai
 About 99% of mammals' bodies are made up of carbon, nitrogen, calcium, sodium, chlorine, potassium, hydrogen, phosphorus, oxygen, and sulfur
 carbonic yogikon main adhikanshtah carbon or nitrogen hota he or adhikansh oxygen va hydrogen pani main maujuud rahete hai
 The inorganic elements present in abundance act as ionized electrolytes
 sabase mahatvapurn aayan hai, sodium, potacium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, phosphate or carbonic aayan, bicarbonate
 koshikaon kii jhilliyon ke paar gradianton ke bane rahane par aasaran dabaav or ph bana rahata he
 Ions are also important for pulse and muscle, as the action potentials in these tissues are produced by the exchange of electrolytes between the extracellular fluid and the cell fluid
 electrolite koshika jhilli ke aayan channel naamak proteinon ke jariye koshikaon ke bheetar ghuste or baahar nikalate hai
 For example, muscle contraction is dependent on the movement of calcium, sodium, and potassium through the channels and T-tubules of the cell membrane
 sankraman dhaatuen jeevon main saadharantah tres tatwon ke rup main maujuud rahati hai, jinamein jasta or loha sabase prachur maatra main hote hai
 These metals are used as cofactors in some proteins and are essential for the activity of enzymes such as catalase and oxygen-carrier proteins such as hemoglobin
 ye sahakaarak kisi vishisht protein se majbootee se bandhe rahete hai
 Although enzyme cofactors can be modified at the time of catalysis, they return to their original state after catalysis
 apachay bade anuon kaa vighatan karne vaali chayapachayee prakriyaaon kaa ek samooh he
 These include decomposition and oxidation of food particles
 apachayi pratikriyaaon kaa uddeshy upachayi pratikriyaaon ke liye aavashyak urja or padaarth uplabdh karnaa he
 The true nature of these catabolic reactions varies from organism to organism, and organisms can be classified according to the table below, based on their energy and carbon sources
 carbonic anu organotraphon main urja ke strot ke rup main prayog main laae jate hai, jabaki lithotraph acarbonic padaarthon kaa or phototraph suryaprakash ko rasaynic urja ke rup main prayog main laate hai
 However, all these forms of metabolism are dependent on redox reactions, in which electrons transfer from degraded donor molecules such as organic molecules, water, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, or ferrous ions to customer molecules such as oxygen, nitrate, or sulfate
 pashuon main in pratikriyaaon main jatil carbonic anu vighatit hokar saraltar anuon jaise carbon daai oxide or pani kaa utpaadan karte hai
 In photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and cyanobacteria, these electron-transfer reactions do not release energy, but are always used in the collection of energy absorbed from sunlight
 pashuon main hone vaali sabase aam apachay pratikriyaayein teen mukhya padaavon main banti ja sakati hai
 In the first stage, large organic molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, or fatty substances are converted into small fractions outside the cells by digestion

 On this basis, three categories of civilizations have been given - Category-1, Category-2 and Category-3
 1964 me kaardashev ne kisi pargrahi sabhyataa ke takneekee vikaas kii kshamta ko maapne ke liye is maapni ko prastaavit kiya
 According to Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev various stages of development of civilization can be categorized according to energy consumption

 The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei of different origin located in the brain of spinal organisms that function as a combined functional unit
 ve mastishk ke agr bhaag ke aadhaar kshetra main sthit hote hai or cerebral cortex, thilemus tathaa mastishk ke anya kshetron se majbootee se jude hote hai
 The basal ganglia are associated with a variety of tasks, including voluntary mobility control, procedural learning related to daily behavior or "habits", eye movements, cognitive and emotional functions
 vartmaan main lokapriy siddhant basal gangliya ko mukhyatah kriya chayan ke liye jimmedaar maanate hai, arthath is baat kaa nirnay karnaa ki ek samay par vibhinn sambhav vyavhaaron main se kise karnaa he
 Experimental studies show that the basal ganglia exert inhibitory effects on several motile mechanisms, and the motile mechanism is activated as soon as this inhibitory effect is removed
 basal gangliya main "vyavhaar kaa badalanaa" mastisk ke kai hisson se prasaarit hone vaale sanketon se prabhavit hota he, jisamen sammilit he prifrantal cortex jo ki kaaryakari kaamon main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 The main components of the basal ganglia are the striatum, also called neostriatum, which is composed of the caudate and putamen, the globus pallidus or pallidum which is composed of the globus pallidus externa or the globus pallidus interna, the substra nigra which is the substra nigra pars compacta and the substra
 The pars consists of the reticulata and the subthalamic nucleus
 The striatum, which is the largest component, receives input from several brain regions but only sends output to other components of the basal ganglia
 palidam sabase mahatvapurn input striatum se praapt karata he or nirodhatmak output gatishiltaa se sambandhit kai kshetron ko bhejtaa he, jisamen sammilit he thilemus kaa hissaa jo cortex ke gatishiltaa se sambandhit kshetron ko ubharta he
 The reticulata, which is a part of the Substenia nigra, acts like the pallidum, and another part called the compacta provides the input of the neuro-transmitter dopamine source to the striatum
 sabathalemic nabhik mukhya rup se striatum tathaa cortex se input praapt karata he or palidam ke hisse ko bhej detaa he
 Each of these regions has an intrinsic structural and neuro-chemical organization
 vibhinn tantrika avasthaaon, jiname kai gatishiltaa se jude vikaar hai, main basal gangliya kendriya bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Most notable are Parkinson's disease, in which melanin pigmented dopamine-producing cells collapse in the compacta on the substrainsia nigra and Huntington's disorder in which the striatum is originally damaged
 kuch vyavhar niyantran se jude vikaron main basal gangliya kii akaryakshmata avasthaa bhi pai jaati he, jaise ki, torates syndrome main, belismus, jununee badhyakaari vikaar, evam wilson rog 
 wilson rog or hemi belismus vikaar ke alawa parkinsans vikaar evam hantingtons vikaar se sambandhit neuro pathology tantron ko thik prakaar se samajha nahin ja sakaa he athwa ve ab bhi vikasshil saidhantik avasthaa main hi hai
 The basal ganglia have an extremity-like area with components distinctly named - nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, and ventral tegmental region
 Efferents provide dopamine to the nucleus accumbens in the same way that the substrains provide dopamine to the nigra dorsal striatum
 chunki aise bahut saare sakshya hai jo darshaate hai ki durlabh adhyayan main isaki kendriya bhoomika hoti he, atah vitie → ene ke dopaminergic prakshepan ne badi sankhya main is ore dhyaan aakarshith kiya he
 For example, many highly addictive drugs, including cocaine, amphetamines, and nicotine, are thought to act by enhancing the efficacy of the VTA → NA dopamine signal
 is baat ke bhi saboot hai ki paagalpan main vitie → ene dopaminergic prakshepan ati uttejnaa par prabhavi he
 The classification of the human nervous system from the point of view of development is often based on 3 basic primitive cavities
 ukt praathmik guhaayen maanav bhrun main neural nalika ke saamaanya vikaas ke samay banati hai or prarambh main isamen rostral se kodal abhivinyas main sammilit rahati hai- procenciphelon, messencephelon, evam robenciphelon guhaayen
 baad main, tantrika tantra ke vikaas ke dauraan, prayek anubhag chote-chote avyavon main parivartit ho jate hai
 The following table shows this developmental classification and follows the body structure found in the basal ganglia
 : The basal ganglia are a basic component of telencyphelone
 iske vipareet, cortics kii parat agramastishk kii sataha ko astr karti hai, jab ki basal gangliya jo ki grey padaarth kaa alag hi dikhaai dene vaala samooh he vah mastishk kii gaharaai main thilemus ke sangam ke sameep hi sthit hota he
 Like most parts of the brain, the basal ganglia also have left and right sides in the form of virtual images of each other
 shaareerik sanrachanaatmak drushti se sharir sanrachana shastriyon ne basal gangliya ko chaar alag-alag sanrachanaon main vibhajit kiya he or yah vibhaajan is par nirbhar karata he ki ukt sanrachana kitni behatar tareeke se rostral hai : inamen se do arthath striatum evam palidam apekshaakrit badi hai, anya do, arthath sabstantia nigra evam sabthelmic nabhik aakaar main choti sanrachana hai
 In the example on the right, the position of the components of the basal ganglia is shown in the two cranial section maps of the human brain
 tipanni ke swarup spasht kiya jaataa he ki, ukt maanchitr main dikhaai na dene vaale, sabthelmic nabhik or sabstantia nigra mastisk main bahut peeche sthit hai
 The striatum is the largest component of the basal ganglia
 striatum kii sanrachana ko kuch vishisht dishaao main kaate jane par dhaariyaan dikhaai detii hai jiname se kai chote-bade tantrika tantuon kaa ugam dikhaai detaa he, isliye iske liye shabd "striatum" prayukt kiya jaataa he
 Earlier anatomy scientists had tested the human brain and understood that the striatum is made up of two different substances that have been isolated by the expansion of a white substance called the internal capsule
 unhone in do padaarthon ko codet or putamin kaa naam diya
 aadhunik sharir sanrachana vaigyanikon ne sookshmdarshi or neuro rasinic adhyayanon dwaara nishkarsh nikaala ki in padaarthon ko ek hi rachana arthath striatum ke do alag hisson ke rup main maananaa uchit he, thik usee tarah, jis tarah kisi nagar ko koi nadi do hisson main pruthak karti he
 Several functional differences between the caudate and putamen have been identified, but are thought to be the result of facts under which each region of the striatum has been found to be essentially connected to specific parts of the cerebral cortex
 striatum kaa aantarik sanghathan asaadhaaran rup se jatil he
 Most of the neurons in it are of the "medium spiny neurons" type
 ve jiabiergik koshikaayen hai jinaki koshika nikaay chote hai or dendrit ghaney dendrytic kaanton se aachhadit hai jinhen syneptic input multah cortex evam thilemus se praapt hote hai
 Medium thorny neurons can be divided into subtypes in several ways, depending on neurochemical and method of attachment
 aglaa sabase adhik bahu-sankhya kaa prakaar, bade, chikani dendrit yukt, colinergik antarneurons hai
 There are many other types of intrinsic neurons, which are small segments of the neural population
 kai adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki cortex or striatum ke bich aamtaur par sthalakritik sambandh rahe hai, arthath, cortex kaa prayek hissaa striatum ke kuch bhaag ko, uske baad anya ko, majboot input bhejtaa he
 The nature of the topography is difficult to understand, but, perhaps in part because the organization of the striatum is organized in three dimensions while the cortex, as a layered structure, is held in two
 is aiami visangati ke chalate ek sanrachana kaa duusari par maanchitran karne main badi maatra main virupan or algaav dikhaai padataa he
 Interestingly, the same topographic relationships apply to the thalamus striatal
 palidam globas palids naamak ek badi sanrachana hoti he joki ek chote udar taleey vistaar ke saath sthit hoti he, jise ventral palidam kaha jaataa he
 Globus pallidus appears as a single nerve substance, but due to functional differences can be divided into two parts, those parts are called internal extracellular segments, and also abbreviated as GPI and GPE
 donon khandon main multah jiabergik neurons hote hai, jo unke lakshya par nirodhatmak prabhaav dikhaate hai
 The above two sections participate in different neural circuits
 bahari khand athwa jipii ko pramukh rup se input prapti striatum se hoti he or vah sabathalemus nabhik par prakshepit hota he
 The inner segment, or GPI, receives signals by the striatum through two paths, called "direct" and "indirect" paths
 palidle neurons ek "gaiyr nirodhatmak" siddhant kaa upyog kar kaary karte hai
 The said neurons project at a steady high rate in the absence of input and they are in a state of "stagnation" as indicated by the striatum
 chunki swayan palidle neurons kaa unke lakshyon par nirodhatmak prabhaav he, palidam ko praapt input kaa kul prabhaav palidle koshika dwaara lakshyon par pradarshit niyantrit nirodh ke rup main dikhaai detaa hai
 Substencia nigra is a miscephalic gray matter portion of the basal ganglia that is divided into SNR and SNC
 aksar esaenar jipiai ke saath saamanjasy main kaam karata he evam esaenar - jipiai complex, thilemus kaa nirodhi kaary karata he
 Substantia nigra pars compacta forms the neuro transmitter dopamine, which is very important in balancing the striatal tract
 neeche diya gaya paripath basal gangliya ke avyavon kii bhoomika evam paripath ko samajhaata he
 The subthalamic nucleus is a diencephalic gray matter of the basal ganglia, and is the only part of the ganglia that actually forms the "excitatory" glutamic acid transmitter
 sabathalemic nabhik kii bhoomika esaenar-jipiai complex ko uttejit karnaa he or saath hi vah "apratyaksh maarg" kaa ek hissaa bhi hota he
 To understand the complex circuit of the basal ganglia, we first need to know the important partners of the circuit
 basal gangliya thilemus or cortex ke saath sidhe sampark main hota he
 Therefore, the circuit produced by the basal ganglia consists of the three main partners of the cortex, the thalamus, and the basal ganglia, the basal ganglia
 maanav mastishk cortex, satta kii ucchtam sthiti, evam jagat ke prati jaagruk dharna ke liye jimmedaar hota he
 All functions performed directly or indirectly by the nervous system are related to the cortex
 cortex ke kai alag-alag kshetra bhinn-bhinn kaamon ko anjaam dete hai
 One such part of the pre-central gyrus cortex is also known as the "motor cortex"
 cortex ke motor cortex kshetra ke vishisht neurons apane eksans ko basal gangliya ke striatum bhaag tak vistrut karte hai
 The neurons of the said cortics release the neurotransmitter glutamate, which is stimulating in nature
 glutamet se utsahit hone ke baad striatum main sthit koshikaayen do vibhinn dishaao main prakshepit hokar do pramukh path kaa nirmaan karti hai- "pratyaksh " evam "paroksh " paripath
 Once stimulated by the cortex in the direct circuit, the cells of the striatum produce a neuro-transmitter called anticonvulsant neurons) that the SNR-GPI projects onto complex cells
 esaenar or jipiai, lagaataar jieb nirmit karte hue ansa lenticulaaris paripath dwaara thilemus se sampark main rahete hue us par nirodhatmak prabhaav kriyanvit karne hetu prayatnsheel rahete hai
 Due to the inhibitory effect of SNR-GPI, the final conclusion is the omission of inhibitory effect on the thalamus
 yah dilachasp baat he ki thilemus khud cortex par prakshepit ho lagaataar cortex ko glutamet dwaara uttejit karata he
 Therefore, the direct circuit allows the thalamus to stimulate the cortex
 After being stimulated, the cortex transmits this "stimulation" message to the muscle via the lateral cortico spinal tract, resulting in hyper-kinetic behavior
 nimna aarekh "pratyaksh" maarg darshata he: Cortex - -> Striatum - -> "SNR-GPI" Complex - -> Thalamus - -> Cortex - -> Muscle, etc
 -> vipareet sire par apratyaksh paripath hota he jo ki striatum ke neurons se hi armbh hota he
 As soon as groups of neurons located in the striatum are stimulated by the cortex, the inhibitory axons now transmit anticonvulsant signals to cells of the globus pallidus externa
 jipii sabathalemic nabhik ko lagaataar nirodhi prabhaav darshaate hai
 stns are actually stimulated by the anticonvulsant effect
 iske falswaroop estn bhi tatpar hokar complex esaenar-jipiai ko uttejit karte hai, jahaan esaenar - jipiai complex kaa mukhya kaary thilemus par nirodhi prabhaav daalana hota he
 As a result, there is a decrease in the action of the thalamus by the thalamus to actually stimulate the cortex
 iske falswaroop cortex, parshv cortico spinal tract dwaara mansapeshiyon ko kam uttejit kar, ati gatij sthiti athwa gati main kami, main sahyog karata he
 In short, direct and indirect circuits are conflicting in performance
 cortex - -> striatum - -> jipii - -> estn - -> "esaenar-jipiai" complex - -> thilemus - -> cortex - -> mansapeshiyon, aadi -> However, if the direct circuit helps the motion and the indirect circuit does not help, then there is a paradox about the innate voluntary motion in the human body
 is virodhabhas kaa nidaan substenshia nigra pars compecta ke karyanvayan dwaara hota he jo dopamine kaa utpaadan karte hai
 Dopamine has specific D1 receptors located in the basal ganglia to stimulate the "direct" pathway, while dopamine has specific antagonistic effects on specific D2 receptors located in the basal ganglia and actually helps the "indirect pathway"
 is tarah sharir, gati evam uski anupasthiti ke bich taratamya rakh santulit sthiti kaa nirmaan karata he
 In this delicate system, due to an unbalanced condition, diseases such as Parkinson's disorder arise
 basal gangliya or uske avyavon kaa namakaran hameshaa samasyagrast rahaa he
 By looking at the anatomical structure of the former anatomist, but being unaware of the cellular construction of neural chemistry, he accumulated components that are now believed to carry out different functions, and thus They gave different names to the components which are now understood to be parts of the same structure, from a functional point of view
 "basal" shabd is tathy se upja he ki iske adhikansh tatv agramastishk ke basal hisse main sthit hai
 The term ganglia is a misnomer: in modern usage, only the neural / neural groups of the peripheral nervous system are referred to as "ganglia" while the neural / neural groups of the central nervous system are called "nuclei"
 is kaaran se, basal gangliya ko kabhi kabhi "basal nabhik" ke naam se bhi janaa he
 Terminological Anatomica, the international authority for anatomy nomenclature, has suggested the name "nucleus basalis", which is not commonly used
 antarrashtriya basal gangliya sosayadi anaupchaarik rup se maanati he ki basal gangliya yah striatum, palidam, substenshia nigra evam sabathalemic nabhik se bana he
 Percheron etc
, in 1991 and Parent and Parent in 2005 included the central part of the thalamus as a part of the basal ganglia, while mena-segovia etc
 also included the pedunculopontine complex in 2004

 Anatomy studies, mainly anatomical studies of mice and apes, and studies of the disorders that damage them, provide information about the functions of the basal ganglia
 basal gangliya ke vishay main vistrut jaankaree kaa sabase bada strot do tantrika shaastra ke vikaar, parkinsons rog tathaa hantington rog hai
 For both of these disorders, nerve damage can be well known and correlated with the resulting symptoms
 parkingsanse rog main, ssabstenshia nigra main sthit dopaminargik koshikaon kaa bada nuksaan hota he, hantington rog main striatum main sthit madhyam kantedaar neurons kaa baari nuksaan hota he
 The symptoms of the two diseases are almost opposite - Parkinson's disease is characterized by a loss of ability to function, while Huntington's disease is characterized by an inability to prevent movement of parts of the body voluntarily

 Thus, both disorders are mainly classified into malaise of activity
 ek bhinn kism kaa, gatividhi kii aswasthta se sambandhit rog, jise hemibelismus naam se janaa jaataa he or sabathelamic nabhik kii kshati ke chalate hota he
 Symptoms of hemibellism are violent and uncontrolled movements of hands and feet

 The SC is a layered structure whose levels form two-dimensional maps of the visual site
 essi ke staron kii gaharaai main tantrika gatividhi kii ek "takkar" netron kii halchal ko dekhe gaye kisi bindu par nirdeshit karti he
 The SC receives a strong inhibitory projection from the BG originating from the substra nigra pars reticulata

 All types of eye movements in SNR are associated with "stopping" - but individual SNR neurons may be more strongly associated with certain types of movement / movement
 codet nabhik ke kuch bhaagon main ke neurons bhi netra kii halchal se sambandhit gatividhi darshaate hai
 Since a large number of caudate cells are projecting at a low rate, this action is most often exhibited as an increase in the rate of projection
 codet nabhik main uttejnaa se netron kii halchal armbh hoti he, joki esaenar par sidhe jiabergik prakshepanon ke marfat nirodhi prabhaav pradarshit karti he
 Although the role of the basal ganglia in motor control is clear, it is known from several indications that it is fundamentally involved in the control of behavior to the level of motivation
 parkingsanse rog main, avyavon kii halchal kii kshamta kaa nishpaadan adhiktar prabhavi nahin hota, kintu prerak kaarak jaise ki bhukh, halchal kaa armbh karne main vifal he athwa use uchit samay par jari karne main asafal he
 Parkinson also describes sedation in patients sometimes with "paralysis of desire"

 The Sundering, Splitting Open1
 When the sky is rent asunder, 2
 And hearkens to its Lord, and it must needs ;- 3
 And when the earth is flattened out, 4
 And casts forth what is within it and becomes empty, 5
 And hearkens to its Lord,- and it must needs ;- 
 6
 o thou man! Verily thou art ever toiling on towards thy Lord- painfully toiling,- but thou shalt meet Him
 7
 Then he who is given his Record in his right hand, 8
 Soon will his account be taken by an easy reckoning, 9
 And he will turn to his people, rejoicing! 10
 But he who is given his Record behind his back,- 11
 Soon will he cry for perdition, 12
 And he will enter a Blazing Fire
 13
 Truly, did he go about among his people, rejoicing! 14
 Truly, did he think that he would not have to return ! 15
 Nay, nay! for his Lord was watchful of him! 16
 So i do call to witness the ruddy glow of Sunset; 17
 The Night and its Homing; 18
 And the Moon in her fullness: 19
 Ye shall surely travel from stage to stage
 20
 What then is the matter with them, that they believe not?- 21
 And when the Qur'an is read to them, they fall not prostrate, 22
 But on the contrary the Unbelievers reject 
 23
 But Allah has full knowledge of what they secrete 24
 So announce to them a Penalty Grievous, 25
 Except to those who believe and work righteous deeds: For them is a Reward that will never fail

 Thakur Dungar Singh and Thakur Jawahar Singh Shekhawat were cousins, Thakur Uday Singh of Dungar Singh Patoda and Thakur Dalel Singh of Jawahar Singh Bathot were the sons of Thakur Dungar Singh Shekhawati Brigade, the objective of establishing Shekhawati Brigade was to establish peace in Shekhawati
 The name was to interfere in the rule of Shekhawati by crushing the anti-british rebellion that was flourishing in Shekhawati
 There was a rift between Rao Raja Rampratap Singh ji and his brother Bhairav singh of Sikar, with the help of this Deity, the British were trying to spread their hands in the power of Sikar, looking at the then conditions of Shekhawati, Thakur Dungar Singh Ji along with some of his companions, Shekhawati Taking up arms, camels, horses from the brigade revolted and looted terror in the British ruled territories
 The British power got terrorized due to the joining of other rebels with them
 The Shekhawati Brigade as well as the forces of Sikar, Jaipur, Bikaner, Jodhpur became active against them
 In 1895, Bhairav singh Gaur of Jadwasa village By showing terror and greed which was closely related to them, the British agreed to arrest Dungar Singh, Bhairav singh tricked Dungar Singh from the British
 The British were caught and the British locked Dungar Singh in the jail of the Red Fort of Agra
 This scare provoked fierce anger among Dungar Singh's companions and plans were made to attack the fort of Agra, according to the plan Lothoo Nitharwal and Sawanta Meena Agra Visiting the fort secretly obtained the information inside the fort
 The forces of Jodhpur became active against them
 In 1895, Bhairav singh Gaur of Jhadwasa village, who was close relative of them, agreed to capture Dungar Singh by showing terror and greed, Bhairav singh fraudulently gave Dungar Singh The British got him captured and the British locked Dungar Singh in Agra's Red Fort jail

 Digital electronics or digital electronics is a branch of electronics in which electrical signals are numeric
 ankiy sanket bahut tarah ke ho sakate hai kintu binary digital sanket sabase adhik upyog main aate hai
 Zero / one, on / off, yes / no, low / high etc
 are some examples of binary signals

 ankiy electronic, yaa sookshmadvik aankik paddati aisi pranali he jo vidyut sanketon ko, rekhiy str ke ek nirantar pattiyon ke bajaae ek alag alag pattiyon kii shrinkhalaa ke rup main darshaati he
 All levels in this stripe indicate the same state of signals
 sanketo kii is pruthakta kii vajah se nirmaan sahansheeltaa ke kaadan rekhiy sanketo ke str main aaye apekshaakrit chote badlaav alag aavaran nahin chhodte he
 As a result, the circuit sensing the state of the signals ignores them
 zyaadaatar maamalon main sanketo kii avasthaa kii sankhya do hoti he or in do avasthaaon ko do voltage staron dwaara darshaya jaataa he: prayog main aapurti voltage ke aadhaar par ek va doosraa | 1 ucch str par hota he va 0 nimna str par
 Often these two levels are represented as "low" and "high"
 aankik takanic kaa mul laabh is tathy par aadhaarit he ki sanketo kii ek satat shrinkhalaa ko punarutpaadit karne ke bajaae, electronic upkaran ko sanketo kii 0 yaa 1 jaise kisi gyaat avasthaa main bhejnaa zyada aasaan hota he
 Digital electronics are generally made up of large combinations of logic gates and simple electronics of Boolean logic functions

 For example, a signal of a long sound made in the order of 1 and 0 can be reconstructed without error provided that the noise produced during the making of the signal is not so much that 1 and 0 cannot be detected
 
 sidi main ek ghante ke sangeet ko kareeb 60 lakh dwiadhari ankon ke rup main sangrahit kiya ja saktaa he
 In a digital system, more binary digits can be used to represent a more accurate signal
 haalanki is prakriya ke liye isamen adhik aankik paripath kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, chunki prayek ank ek hi prakaar ke hardware dwaara sambhala jaataa he natijatan ek aasaan maapneey tantra kaa nirmaan ho jaataa he
 An analog system requires a basic improvement in additional resolution linearity and a basic improvement in the noise characteristics of each phase of the signal chain
 computer niyantrit digital system ko software dwaara niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he jo ki hardware ko badale bina nae function ko jodne kii anumati detaa he
 And often this can be done outside the factory with the updated product software
 jisase utpaada ke dizin kii trutiyon ko graahak ke haath main utpaada ke aane ke baad sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he
 Storage of information can be done easily in digital system as compared to analog
 digital system kaa shor pratiraksha vighatan ke bina data ko sangrahit or punah praapt karne kii anumati detaa he
 In an analog system, noise from old and discarded information is stored
 ek digital pranali main jab tak kul shorgul ek nishchit str se neeche he, jaankaree ko puri tarah se punah praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In some cases digital circuits use more energy than analog circuits to do similar work and thus heat is generated
 portable yaa bydaree chaalit pranaaliyon main yah digital pranali ke upyog ko simit kar sakati he
 Battery-powered cellular telephones, for example, often use a low-power analog forearm to amplify and establish radio signals from the base station
 haalanki ek base stesan ke paas grid kii shakti hoti he or apekshit vidyut kaa prayog kar sakati he, lekin bahut lacheele software radio main
 is tarah ke base steshnon ke liye aasaani se nae cellular maanakon main prayukt sanket prakriya ko aasaani se riprogram kiya ja saktaa he
 Digital circuits are sometimes very expensive, especially in small quantities
 sanvedya jagat enlog ke hai or is jagat se sanket enlog matraaen hai
 For example light, temperature, sound, electrical conductivity, electrical and magnetic bases are analogs
 sabase upyogi digital system nirantar analog sanketon se digital sanketon ko alag karne ke liye badalanaa hoga
 This causes quantization errors
 agar system vaanchit degree kii vishwastata ke pratinidhitiv karne ke liye paryaapt digital data kaa bhandaaran karata he to parimanikaran truti ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 The Nyquist – Shannon sampling theorem provides an important directive of how much digital data is required to accurately represent a defined analog signal
 kuch pranaaliyon main yadi digital data kaa ek bhaag lupt ho jaae yaa galat tareeke se vyavahrut hon, to sambandhit data ke vishaal khandon kaa arth puri tarah se badal saktaa he
 Because of the clef effect, it is difficult for users to tell if a specific system was right on the verge of failure or whether it can tolerate too much noise before it fails
 digital bhangshiltaa ko ek digital pranali ke roopankan dwaara majbootee ke liye kam kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, a parity bit or other error handling method can be inserted into the signal path
 yah paddati system ko, truti kaa pataa lagane main madad karti he or yaa to trutiyon ko sahi karti he yaa phir kam se kam data kii ek nai pratilipi ke liye puuchhati he
 State transition logic in a state machine can be designed to hold unused state and trigger a reset sequence or other routine error recovery

 This helps protect against failures that can cause the microcontroller instruction to spoil the indicator, which might otherwise lead to the execution of random code
 digital smriti or sanchaaran pranali truti kaa pataa lagane or sudhaar jaise takneekon kaa istemaal sanchaaran or storage main kisi bhi truti ke sudhaar ke liye atirikt data kaa prayog kar sakate hai
 On the other hand in digital systems some techniques are used to make those systems' single bit errors more vulnerable
 ye takanic tabhi sweekaarya hote hai jab antarnihit bits un trutiyon ke nahin hone kii sambhaavna se kaaphi vishwasaneey hote hai
 Digital circuits are composed of analog components
 iske dizin se sunishchit hona chahie ki analog ghatakon ke lakshan icchit digital vyavhaar par haaavee naa hon
 digital system ko shorgul or samay margin, paraseete anugam or capcitance or filter bijli conection kaa prabandhan karnaa chahie
 Poor design leads to intermittent problems such as glitches, vanishing fast pulses that may trigger some logic but not others, "runt pulses" not reaching valid threshold voltages or a combination of unexpected logic states
 jab se digital circuit analog ghatakon se bana hai digital circuit lo-prisishan se bhi dhire gananaa karata he jo ek samaan spes or shakti kaa prayog karata he
 However the digital circuit will be able to assess repeatedly due to its high noise immunity
 On the other hand, analog circuits in high precision domains need more power and digital equivalent area
 ek digital circuit kaa nirmaan aksar logic gates kahe jane vaale chote se electronic circuit se kiya jaataa he
 Each logic gate represents the processes of Boolean logic
 logic get vidyut niyantrit switch kii ek vyavastha hoti he
 The output of a logic gate is an electric current or voltage that can control and bend most logic gates
 aksar logic gates unke aakaar, bijli kii khapat or laagat ko kam karne or unki vishwasaneeyata kii vruddhi karne ke liye sabase kam sankhya main transistor kaa upyog karata he
 Integrated circuits are the least important method of making large amounts of logic gates
 aam taur par ejiniyaron dwaara electronic dizin swachaalan software kaa upyog kar ekikrut circuit kaa dizin kiya hota he 
 Another form of digital circuit consists of lookup tables
 lukup talika, mashiinon par aadhaarit logic geton kii tarah hi kaary kar sakati hai lekin aasaani se taron ko badale bina hi riprogram kar sakati hai
 This means that designers can often repair design errors without changing the wiring arrangement
 isliye choti maatra main utpaada programeble logic divaais aksar adhimaanya samaadhaan kar rahe hai
 They are typically designed by engineers using electronic design automation software
 jab sanskaran madhyam se bade hote hai or tark dhime ho sakate hai yaa jatil elgoritham yaa anukram shaamil kiye jate hai, tab aksar ambeded pranali banane ke liye ek chota-se microcontrolar ko program kiya jaataa he
 These are usually programmed by software engineers
 jab keval ek digital circuit kii aavashyaktaa ho or isaki dizin puri tarah se customiod ho, tab fectory production line controlar ke liye paaramparik samaadhaan programeble logic controlar yaa PLC he
 These are typically programmed by electricians using logic ladders
 logic kriyaaon ko kam karne ke liye ejeeniyar kai tareekon ko apanaate hai, taaki circuit kii jatilta ko kam kiya ja sake
 When complexity is low, circuit errors and electronics are also less and hence they are less expensive
 ek CAD pranali ke bheetar aspreso hiuristic logic minumaizar kii tarah ek nunatam elgorithm sabase vyapak rup se istemaal kiya gaya sarleekaran he haalanki aitihaasik rup se dwiadhari nirnay rekhachitr ek swachaalit quine-mccluskey elgorithm, truth teble, karnog maanchitr or bulian bijganit kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 Representations are important for the design of an engineer's digital circuit
 kuch vishleshan vidhiyaan keval vishesh pratinidhitiv ke saath kaam karti hai
 Representation of digital circuits with an equivalent set of logic gates is a classical method
 praayah kam se kam electronic ke saath electronic swichon ke samakaksh pranali kaa nirmaan ek doosraa tarika he 
 One of the easiest ways is to have a memory with only one table
 memory ke pate par input daale jate hai or memory ke data autput, autput ban jate hai
 These reports have digital file formats for automatic analysis that can be processed by computer programs
 adhikansh digital ejeeniyar anukool fil swaroop ke saath computer program ke chayan main saavdhaanee baratate hai
 Engineers consider the types of digital systems for reporting
 adhikansh digital system "sangyojan system" or "anukramik system" main vibhajit ho jate hai
 The input that is given in a combination system always gives the same output
 yah mul rup se logic prakriya ke set kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or jisaki charchaa pehle hi kii ja chuki he
 a sequential system is a combinatorial system with outputs inserted as inputs
 isse digital mashin opershan kaa kram se sanchaalan karata he
 The simplest sequential system is probably a flip flop, a mechanism that represents a binary digit or "bit"
 anukramik pranali ko aksar state mashin ke rup main dizin kiya jaataa he
 In this way engineers can design the aggregate behavior of a system and even test it in continuous simulation without considering the details of the logic processes without considering all the details of the logic functions
 anukramik system iske atirikt do upashreniyon main vibhajit hota he
 When a "clock" signal changes the state, the "synchronous" sequential system changes the state at once
 jab bhi input badalte hai "atulykaalik" anukramik pranali parivartan ko prasaarit karata he
 Synchronous sequential systems are characterized by asynchronous circuits such as flip flops, which make these changes only when the clock changes and in which the timing margin is carefully designed
 hameshaa kii tarah ek tulykaalik anukramik state mashin ko ek sangyojan logic main vibhajit karke lagu karne kaa vyaavhaarik tarika hota he or flip flop ke set ko "state register" kaha jaataa he
 Each time a clock gives a ticking signal and the state register captures the response generated from the previous state of the combinational logic and re-inserts it as the invariant input to the combinational part of the state machine
 sangyojan logic main samay ke khapat vaale adhikansh logic akalan dwaara ghadi kii sabase tej dar set hoti he
 The state register represents just one binary number
 agar state mashin main state bahut zyada hai to logic prakriya kuch sangyojan logic hote hai jo kai sankhya main state kaa utpaadan karti hai
 In comparison, the design of asynchronous systems is very difficult because the possible state must be considered at all possible times
 nunatam or adhiktam samay ke teble ke nirmaan ke sabase saamaanya vidhi ke anusaar isamen saare state vidyaman ho or vaise state ke minimise ke liye circuit ko samyojit kiya jaataa he or jo iske sabhi hisson ke susangat state main samay-samay par jane ke liye circuit ko baadhya kare
 aise saavdhaan dizin ke bina sanyogvash atulykaalik logic kaa utpaadan karnaa aasaan he jo "asthir" he or vaastavik electronics he jisamen apratyaashit parinaam hote hai kyonki electronic upkarnon ke mulyon main chote badlaavon kii vajah se sanchit vilamb hota he
 Some circuits are inherently asynchronous in their design and should be analyzed as such
 2005 ke rup main lagbhag sabhi digital mashine tulykaalik dizin hote hai kyonki tulykaalik dizin ko bananaa or satyapit karnaa bahut aasaan he-vartmaan main digital mashiinon kii nakal karne vaale softver, atulykaalik dizin ko nahin sambhalate
 tathaapi, atulykaalik tark ko behatar samajha jaataa he, yadi usase kaam nikaala ja sake to, kyonki uski gati ghadi dwaara manamaane dhang se gati simit nahin he, bajaay, yah un logic geton dwaara anumat gati par saamaanya rup se chalati he, jinase inkaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 Constructing an asynchronous circuit using fast parts indirectly "runs" the circuit faster
 aam taur par, kai digital system, data pravaah mashine hai
 Often they are designed using synchronous register transfer logic and have been used as VHDL or Verilog hardware description languages
 register hastantaran logic main dwiadhari sankhya flip flop ke samoohon main sangrahit hai jise register kaha jaataa tha
 The output of each register is a bundle of wires called a "bus" that passes that number for other estimation
 yah akalan keval sangyojan logic kaa ek bhaag he
 Each estimation has a bus output and can be connected to multiple input registers
 kabhi-kabhi ek register ke paas inke input par bahusanketak hota he jisase yah kai bason main se kisi ek se nambar ko store kar saktaa he
 Alternatively the output of several things can be connected via buffers which can turn off the output of all devices except one
 input se prayek register ke naye data ko sweekaar karne par anukramik state mashin niyantran karata he
 In the 1980s some researchers found that almost all synchronous register-transfer machines could be converted to asynchronous designs using first-in-first-out synchronization logic
 is yojana main digital mashin, ek data pravaah ke ek set ke rup main pahachaani jaati he
 At each step of the flow, an asynchronous "synchronization circuit" determines when the output of that step is solid and gives a presented signal to "hold the data" to the stages in which the inputs to those stages are used
 iske liye kuch apekshaakrit saral tulykaalan circuit kii aavashyaktaa he
 The most general-purpose transfer-logic machine is a computer
 yah multah ek swat: binary abekas he
 The control unit of a computer is typically designed as a micro program run by a microsensor
 yah micro program ek player-piano role kii tarah hoti he
 Each table commands every bit of entry or "word" state of the micro program that controls the computer
 anukramak phir use ginati karata he or memory yaa sangyojan logic mashin main yah ginati sambodhit karata he jisamen micro program samahit hota he
 The bits from the microprogram control the arithmetic logic unit, memory and other parts of the computer, and the microservices itself
 is tarah computer ke niyantran kii digining ke jatil kaary ko apekshaakrit kaaphi saral logic mashiinon ke sangrah ke saral kaaryon main parivartit kar diya gaya
 Computer architecture is a specialized engineering activity that tries to classify registers, assessment logic, buses, and other parts of a computer in some way for the best purpose
 computer vaastukar ne laagat kam karne or gati ko teevr karne or computer programing trutiyon kii pratiraksha ke liye computer ke dizin main vrihad maatra main suprayog ko lagaaya he
 And its simple purpose is to reduce power in a fast battery powered computer system
 kai computer architech microprogrammers ke rup main vistrut prashikshuta kii seva de rahe hai
 "typical computers" are typically a traditional computer with a special purpose micro program
 mahange ejineering prayaason se bachane ke liye, badi logic mashiinon ke dizine banane ke prayaas kaaphi kuch swachaalit kar die gaye hai
 Computer programs are called "electronic design automation devices" or simply "EDA"
 logic kaa, saral truth teble-style kaa vivaran, aksar EDA ke saath ishtatam kiya jaataa he jo logic get kii ghatit pranaaliyon ko swatah utpaadit karata he yaa chote lukup teble ko, jo abhi bhi vaanchit parinaam dete hai
 The most common example of this type of software is the espresso heuristic logic minimizer
 vishaal logic pranaliyon ke anukulan ke liye adhikansh vyaavhaarik elgoridam, bijiy jodtod yaa dwiadhari nirnay aarekh kaa upyog karte hai or anuvanshik kalan vidhi or tapiya anukulan ke saath prayog, sambhaavna se bhare hai
 To automate costly engineering processes, some edas can take state tables that describe a state machine and can produce a truth table or a function table for a mixed part of a state machine
 state teble paath kaa ek tukdaa he jo prayek state ko paristhitiyon ke saath soochibaddh karata he, jo unke or sambandhit utpaadan sanketon ke bich sankraman ko niyantrit karata he
 It is common for function tables of such computer generated state machines to be optimized with the logic minimization software Minelog
 aksar, vaastavik logic pranaliyaan, up-pariyojnaon kii ek shrinkhalaa ke rup main dizin kii gai hoti hai, jinhen ek "upkaran pravaah" ke upyog se sanyojit kiya jaataa he
 The tool flow is usually a "script", a simple computer language that can implement software design tools in the correct order
 bade logic system ke liye upkaran pravaah, jaise microprocesar, hajaaron cmand lambey ho sakate hai or saikadon ejiniyaron ke kaam ko sanyojit karte hai
 Writing and debugging equipment flow is an established engineering specialty in companies producing digital design
 upkaran pravaah aam taur par ek vistrut computer fil yaa filon ke set main mit jaataa he jo yah varnan karata he ki kaise logic kaa bhautik rup se nirmaan karen
 This often includes transistor and wire drawing instructions on an integrated circuit or printed circuit board
 upkaran pravaah ke hisson ko, apekshit input ke khilaaf nakli logic ke output kii pushti karne ke dwaara dibag kiya jaataa he
 Testing equipment takes computer files with a set of inputs and outputs and highlights discrepancies between simulated behavior and expected behavior
 ek baar input data ko sahi maanane ke baad, khud dizine ko abhi bhi shuddhta ke liye satyapit kiya janaa chahie
 Some instrument flows confirm the design first by producing a design and then scanning the design to produce input data relevant to the instrument flow
 yadi scan kiya hua data, input data ke saath mail khaataa he, to upkaran pravaah ne shaayad koi trutiyaan pesh nahin kii
 Functional validation data, usually called "test vectors"
 kaaryaatmak pareekshan vector ko sangrakshit kiya ja saktaa he or kaarkaane main yah pareekshan karne ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he ki navnirmit logic sahi dhang se kaam karata he yaa nahin
 Functional test patterns, however, do not discover common construction mistakes
 Production tests, often designed by software tools, are called "test pattern generators"
 logic kii sanrachana kii jaanch or vyavasthit dhang se vishesh dosha ke liye test janit kar, ye pareekshan vector ko utpann karte hai
 In this way fault coverage can reach around 100%, provided the design is properly testable

 To save time, small sub-machines are isolated by permanently installed "design for Test" circuitry and tested independently
 "scan dizin" naam kii ek aam pareekshan yojana, test bits ko kramik rup se ek yaa ek se adhik "scan chen" naam ke kramik shift register ke madhyam se hataati he
 In sequential scans, there are only one or two wires to carry the data and reduce the physical size and expenses of the frequently used test logic
 saare pareekshan ke baad, data bits jagah par hai, dizine ko "saamaanya mod" ke liye rikanfigure kiya jaataa he or ek yaa ek se adhik clock pulse ko lagu kiya jaataa hai, taaki dosha kaa pataa lag sake or pareekshan ke parinaam kaa pragrahan scan shift register main flip-flop main or / yaa leches main kiya jaataa he
 Finally, the test result is shifted to the block boundary and the forecast is compared against the "good machine" result

 The practicality of a system of digital logic determines many things
 fainout, gati, kam laagat or vishwasaneeyata kaa ek adarsh sangyojan praapt karne ke liye, ejiniyaron ne kai electronic upkarnon kaa nirikshan kiya
 The cost of a logic gate is significant
 1930 ke dashak main, praarambhik digital logic system, telephone riley se banaae jate the kyonki ye saste or apekshaakrit vishwasaneey the
 After that, engineers always used the cheapest available electronic switch, which could still meet the requirements

 Surprising everyone, when circuits began to be produced in bulk, they became the cheapest method of manufacturing digital logic
 is praudyogiki main sudhaar ne laagat main sabhi baad ke sudhaaron ko prerit kiya
 With the increase of integrated circuits, reducing the absolute number of chips used introduced another way of saving costs
 ek diziner kaa lakshya sirf aasaan circuit bananaa nahin he, balki ghatak kii ginati kam rakhana he
 Sometimes this results in a slightly more complex design with respect to the underlying digital logic, but still reduces the number of components, board size, and even power consumption
 udhaaharan ke liye, kuch logic pariwaron main, NAND get, nirmaan hone vaale saralatam digital get hai
 All other logic operations can be implemented by the NAND gate

 This can eliminate the need for a chip with those different types of gate
 ek logic get kii "vishwasaneeyata", asafalataa ke bich uske ausat samay kaa varnan karti he
 Digital machines often have millions of logic gates
 iske alaava, adhikansh digital mashiinon ko unki laagat ko kam karne ke liye "anukulit" kiya jaataa he
 The result is clear, failure of a single logic gate will cause a digital machine to stop working
 digital mashine, pehali baar upyogi tab baniin jab ek switch ke liye MTBF kuch sau ghante se upar ho gaya
 Nevertheless, many of these machines had complications, well-practiced repair procedures, and did not work for many hours due to a tube burning or an insect getting stuck in a relay

 These last for several thousands of hours
 pehla ardhchaalak logic parivaar, rezister-transistor logic tha
 It was a thousand times more reliable than a tube, ran comfortably and used less power, but had very little fan-in of the three
 diod-transistor logic ne fainout main saat tak sudhaar kiya or bijli main kami kii
 Some DTL designs used two power-supplies with synonym layers of NPN and PNP transistors to increase fanout
 transistor transistor logic in par ek mahaan sudhaar tha
 Among the early instruments, the fanout improved to ten and the later developed type achieved twenty
 TTL bhi tej tha, kuch parivartit rup ne swichan kaa bees nanosecond tak kaa kam samay praapt kar liya
 TTL is still used in some designs
