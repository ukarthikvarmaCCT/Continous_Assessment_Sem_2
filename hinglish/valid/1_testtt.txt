 40 percent of goods are leaking into the public distribution system

 They have to leave other productive jobs to get 100 rupees

 This is the obstacle in becoming our superpower
 upaay he ki tamaam kalyankari yojanaon ko samaapt karke bachi huyi rakam ko prayek matadaata ko sidhe rigerv bank ke madhyam se vitarit kar diya jaye
 Each family will get Rs 2000 per month, which will be sufficient to meet their basic needs
 unhen manaregaa main baithkar farji kaary kaa dhong nahin rachana hoga
 They will be able to get jobs and make money
 kalyankari yojanaon main vyaapt bhratachar swat: samaapt ho jaayegaa
 The major problem in implementing this formula is the love of power of political parties
 sarkari karmchaariyon kii lobby kaa saamana karne kaa inamen saahas nahin he
 The gist is that India can become a superpower if a large army of government employees working in welfare programs by political parties is eliminated
 in par kharch kii ja rahi rakam ko sidhe matadaataaon ko vitarit kar dena chaiye
 If we do not solve this problem immediately, we will miss the opportunity to become a superpower
 yah sach he ki bharat mahashakti banane ke kareeb he parantu ham bhrashtachar kii vajah se is se dur hote ja rahe he
 Only when the leaders of India get free time from their wasteful work, then they can think in this regard, if those people are getting free money go to the country
 bharat ko mahashakti banane main jo roda he wo he netaa
 Youths will have to fight against them for this, today a great revolution is needed to make the country a superpower, because a revolution is needed for change, but it will have to be kept in mind that in India, like a powerful country like Russia, the troops will break
 If not, these leaders can change their form at any time to save themselves
 aashcharya nahin ki bhartiya samaaj ke bhrashtachar ke sabase vyast or apradhi adde adaalaton ke parisar hai
 Gandhiji had said that if there was no court, justice started being provided to the poor in India
 nyaaypalika main bhrashtachar he, yah ek aam manyata he
 When a court decision comes against a person, he feels that the judge must have taken money from the opposition people or for some other reason, he has got the court's decision decided in his favor
 kehete sab hai, par darate bhi hai ki aisa kehane par ve adaalat kii avmaananaa ke maamle main funs na jaaen
 Action can be taken against them
 angreji kaal se hi nyaayalay shoshan or bhrashtachar ke adde ban gayi the
 At the same time, there was a belief that the one who was in the courtroom, wasted
 bhartiya nyaaypalika main bhrashtachar ab aam baat ho gayi he
 Impeachment proceedings have been held on many judges of the Supreme Court
 nyaaypalika main vyaapt bhrashtachar main - ghoosekhori, bhai bhatijawad, behad dhimi or bahut lambii nyaay prakriya, bahut hi zyada manhagaa adalati kharch, nyaayalayon kii baari kami or paardarshita kii kami, karmchaariyon kaa bhrasht aacharan aadi jaise karkon kii pramukh bhoomika he
 It is usually said that go to a lawyer, he will definitely get you bail

 This is corruption
 parantu adaalaton ne apane aap ko puri tarah se aise aavaran main dhaanp rakhaa he ki kabhi is par na koi khabar chhapati he, na koi karrwai hoti he
 The law is such that one cannot arrest a judge today
 yah to chhodie, aap unke khilaaf aay se adhik sampatti rakhane kaa mukadmaa nahin bana sakate
 The law is such that if a judge is found in such situations, then the action taken thereon is not made public
 vaise vigat saat dashakon main rajya ke teen angon ke pradarshan par najar daali jaae to nyaaypalika ko hi behatar mana jayega
 On numerous occasions it has prevented constitutional violations by the legislature and the executive with complete loyalty and promptness, but the pyramid of the three crore number of litigations pending in courts is causing concern and fear for the countrymen
 adalati faislon main paanch saal lagaana to saamaanya-si baat he, lekin bees-tees saal main bhi nipataara na ho paanaa aam logon ke liye traasadee se kam nahin he
 The fundamental principle of justice is that delay means denial of justice
 desh kii adaalaton main jab karodon maamalon main nyaay nakaara ja rahaa ho to aam aadmi ko nyaay sulabh ho paanaa akaash ke taare todna jaisaa hoga
 In fact, this procedure is more to blame for not being able to make quick decisions in the courts, which is the result of the British rule and there has not been a big change
 kai maamalon main to vaadi yaa prativaadee hi prayaas karte hai ki faisle kii naubat hi nahin aa paae
 Despite newspapers and TV, they are not resorted to for notice notice and time goes on to serve the notice

 Although corruption has become so common in the country that no corner has been spared from its rot, but still the high-powered judiciary is clean and clean with few exceptions
 2007 kii transperency international kii prativedan anusaar neeche ke str kii adaalaton main lagbhag 2630 karod rupaya bataur rishwat diya gaya
 Now the cases like Justice Sen of West Bengal and Dinakaran of Karnataka have come to light on the judicial image of the judiciary
 mukademon ke niptaare main vilamb kaa ek kaaran bhrashtachar bhi he
 The constitutional process for the removal of judges of the Supreme Court and High Court is so complex that it is very difficult to take action
 nyaayik ayog ke gathan kaa masalaa sarkari jhule main varsho se jhul rahaa he
 Numerous judgments given by the Supreme Court in many cases such as the right to education of children, protection of the environment, medical, corruption, criminalization of politicians, love of effigy of Mayawati, few cases of bribery and numerous cases of desertion have been hidden 
 yah bharat kii garvonnat nyaaypalika kii hi chamchamati misaal he, jahaan supreme court or uske mukhya nyaayadhish un par soochna kaa adhikaar lagu na hone kaa daawa karte hai or dilli hoicourt unki raay se asahmat hokar pitishan khaarij kar detaa he
 It is the Supreme Court, which banned the reservation of Muslims in educational institutions by the Andhra Pradesh government
 supreme court ke mukhya nyaayadhish hon, desh ke vidhi mantri hon yaa anya or lambit mukademon ke ambara ko dekhakar chintaa main dub jate hai, lekin kisi ko hal najar nahin aata he
 On the other hand, the Supreme Court cries out the lack of judges in the courts
 unke anusaar ucch nyaayalay ke liye 1500 or nichali adaalaton ke liye 23000 jajon kii aavashyaktaa he
 As of now, 280 posts are lying vacant in the High Courts
 jajon kii kaary kushalta ke sambandh main haal main sevanivrutt hue urisa hoicourt ke chif justise bilai naaj ne kaha ki magistrate court se lekar supreme court tak ke liye kai jaj faujadaari maamle deal karne main asakshm hai
 The 1998 criminal appeals are pending before the Bombay High Court because no judge is interested in studying the case
 vaise bhi puri suvidhaayen die jane ke baavjood nyaaypalika main saarvajanik avkaash bhi sarvaadhik hote hai
 Shortage of posts and delay in filling the vacant posts are such problems, which should be resolved soon
 hakeekat to yah he ki nyaaypalika kii shithilataa or akushalta se to aparaadh or aatankwaad tak ko badhaava miltaa he
 The Bar Council claims that there are 45 percent fake lawyers in the country

 The strategic history of the country is a witness to the fact that the Indian Army won the battles in the wars only because of its zeal and valor, which the enemy could not win even with big modern weapons
 lekin pichley kuch varshon main jis tarah se, bade shastr aayaat niryaat main, aayudh karagaron main sandehaaspad agincandon kii shrunkhlaa, puraane yanon ke chaalan se uthe sawaal or jane aisi kitni hi ghatnaayen, durghatnaayen or aparaadhik krity sena ne apane naam likhwaaye hai or ab bhi kahin na kahin ye silsilaa zaari he wo is baat kaa ishara kar rahaa he ki ab sthiti pehle jaisi nahin he
 Something very serious is going on somewhere
 sabase dukhad or afasosjanak baat ye he ki ab tak sena se sambandhit adhikansh bhrashtachar or aparaadh sena ke ucchadhikariyon ke naam hi rahaa he
 Despite all the facilities available to the Army officers today, the incidents of big scams and scams in the army, even the supply of armaments, uniforms and rations, the incidents of fake encounters for scam, prizes and encouragement etc
 tell and show It has been said that people who have not worn the uniform for the security of the country have now entered the Indian Army
 aaj sena main hathiyaar aapurti, sainya saamagree aapurti, khaadya rashan padaarthon kii aapurti or eendhan aapurti aadi sab main bahut saare ghapale ghotaale kiye ja rahe hai or isamen unka bharpoor saath de rahe hai sainya evam raksha vibhaagon se jude hue saare bhrasht log
 One of the major reasons for all this being hidden is due to the internal security of the country, these information is very sensitive and hence these information is not transparent, but it is not that it cannot be done

 In such a situation, it is a matter of concern that a journalist from a district, town or block will not spend his life drinking water and air? Is it inevitable that we will broke the news? At the same time, journalists working in many small and medium media houses never get paid even on fixed dates

 sahchar poonjeewaad dekhen It is well known that the current form of bureaucracy in India is a product of British colonial rule
 iske kaaran yah varg aaj bhi apane ko aam bharatiyon se alag, unke upar, unka shaasha or swami samajhataa he
 The more conscious this class is for its rights and facilities, the more indifferent it is to the interests, needs and expectations of the general public
 bharat jab gulam tha, tab mahatma gandhi ne vishwaas jataayaa tha ki aazaadee ke baad apana raaj yani swarajya hoga, lekin aaj jo haalat he, use dekh kar kahana padataa he ki apana raaj he kahaan? us lok kaa tantra kahaan najar aata he, jis lok ne apane hi tantra kii sthapana kii? aaj chaturdik afasarshahi kaa jaal he
 This bureaucracy riding on the chest of democracy is crushing our dreams

 After the attainment of independence, India underwent significant changes under democratic governance, but one thing that did not change was the legacy of bureaucracy and its character
 kade aantarik anushaasan or asandigdh swamibhakti se yukt sarvaadhik pratibhashali vyaktiyon kaa sangathit tantra hone ke kaaran bharat ke sheersh rajanetaaon ne aupniveshik prashasnic model ko aazaadee ke baad bhi jari rakhane kaa nirnay liya
 This time the norms of discipline were made the basis of bureaucracy

 But in just 64 years of independence, our corruption has looted 280 lakh crores
 ek taraf 200 saal main 1 lakh karod he or duusari taraf keval 64 saalon main 280 lakh karod he
 That is, about 4
37 lakh crores every year, or about 36 thousand crores Indian currency has been deposited in Swiss bank by these corrupt people every month

 The way in which the words of 'latin' developed the modern lexicography, it can be seen in the development sequence of the English lexicons
 aarambh main in shabdarthsuchiyon kaa pradhan vidhaan tha clisht 'latin' shabdon kaa saral 'latin' bhashaa main arth suchit karnaa
 Gradually for convenience, remote readers from the Roman land used to write the meaning of those words in their language too
 'glansri' or 'vocabuleri' ke angreji bhashi vidwaanon kii pravriti main bhi yah nai bhaavana jaagi
 As a result of this innovation, the trend of interpreting the words 'latin' in English started increasing
 is kram main latin-angeji kosh kaa aarambhik rup saamne aayaa
 In the tenth century itself, a scholarly scholar 'efric' from the nearby place of 'oxford' had composed a treatise of 'latin' grammar
 or usee ke saath vargeekrut 'latin' shabdon kaa ek 'latin-english', laghukosh bhi jod diya tha
 Probably this was the first in the dictionaries of the said manner
 1066 i0 se lekar 1400 i0 ke bich kii koshotmak shabdsuchiyon ko ekatra karte hue 'rhite bular' ne aisi do shabdsuchinan upasthit kii he

 The second vocabulary contains words from 'latin' and other languages

 In educational institutions, reading of English increased in place of French
 angreji main lekhakon kii sankhya bhi adhik hone lagi
 As a result, the need for a dictionary of English also increased
 15veen shatee main 'rhite vular' ne chah mahatvapurn puraani shabdarthsuchiyon ko mudrit kiya
 They were created mostly on the basis of thematic sections

 Mathew has mentioned two important texts of the 15th century in his work called Survey of English Dictionary
 pratham 'orets' kaa 'vokabularium' tha jo purv 'meddla' vyakaran par aadhaarit tha
 The second was the english-latin dictionary based on 'glafades' or 'geoffrey' grammar
 iskaa pinsin dwaara 1440 i0 main pratham mudrit sanskaran prakashit kiya gaya

 It contains other types of words other than nouns and verbs
 yah 'meddla gramatisij' kadachit pratham 'lathin—angreji' shabdkosh tha
 There is evidence of popularity - due to its many available copies
 1483 een main 'vetholium anglivan ' naamak shabdkosh sankalit hua tha
 But despite being an important dictionary, it did not become as popular as the previous dictionary
 iske pashchaat 16ve shatabdi main 'latin-angranji' or 'angreji-latin' kii anek shabdsuchiyaan nirmit evam prakashit hui
 The dictionary of 'sir Thomas Elliot' is the first book in which the use of 'dictionary' designation is found in English
 mul shabd latin kaa 'dictionarium' he jiskaa arth tha kathan 
 But it was used by grammars in the sense of the word 'kosh'

 According to the Encyclopडियाdia Britannica, the term was first used by John Garlandia for the handwriting of the word 'latin', memorized in 1224 CE
 parantu lagbhag teen shatabdi baad sar tamas eliyat dwaara prayukt yah shabd kyon or kaise lokapriy ho uthaa yah kahana saral nahin he
 By the time of the first half of the 16th century, the idea started to get accepted that the method of looking at the word in the dictionary should be convenient and simple
 is drushti se kosh ke liye varnmaala kram se shabdanukram kii vyavastha upyuktatar maani gai
 This method of the West can be considered as an important achievement and a new turning point in the new development of lexicography

 Mainly for the fulfillment of this - not the feeling of introducing words and idioms in their own language - early English - probably the main inspiration for the creation of the dictionary

 In this, pure words and meanings of three thousand words were instructed

 The structure of this dictionary, divided into three parts, looks somewhat strange
 isaki vibhajanapaddati ko dekhakar 'yask' ke nirukt main nirdisht negmcand, naghantuccand or daibatkaadon main lakshith varganusaari paddati kii smriti ho aati he
 The words from the first part are given with meanings in common language

 Its name was Universal Italic English Dictionary

 Its first edition was published in 1729
 1739 main prakashit duusare sanskaran main shabdon ke uccharanbodhak sanket bhi i samen die gaye
 This dictionary is considered to be a very important English dictionary by English scholar scholars
 pehla kaaran yah tha ki dow janson dwaara nirmit aitihaasik mahatv ke angreji kosh kii yah saadharshila bani
 The second reason was that for the first time the goal of compiling all the English words in it was put
 teesraa kaaran vyutpatti nirdesh karne or uccharansanket dene kii paddati ke pravartan kaa prayas tha
 The program of creation of such authentic lexicons by the Itali and Fans academies was introduced, in which stabilization and certification of recognized uses of the defined language could be carried out
 german, spani, francisi or itali bhashaaon main aise koshon kii rachana kaa prayaas chal rahaa tha
 The literary form of the English language was becoming stronger, developed, accepted and differentiated
 padya yaa chandobaddh bhashaa ke atirikt vach kii rachanaaon ko saahitiyik aadar praapt hone laga tha
 As a result, the then form of the English language became acceptable and valid at the level of the defined language

 The said dictionary of Johnson is considered of utmost historical importance in itself

 At the same time, forty scholars together were making a French-language dictionary in Fras
 uski charchaa karatai hue gentilmans magazine naamak patr ne kaha tha ki france ke chalis vidvan lagbhag aadhi shatee main jo kardh na kar sake use akele jonson ne saat varshon main kar dikhaaya
 The British public said that the dictionary is of utmost importance from the point of view of both the nation and the language
 angreji shabdon ke uccharan, bhashashuddhta kii raksha or prayog kaa sthirikaran karne main is kosh kii bahut bady dein maani jaati he
 But the literary quotations given in it - not taking references from texts instructively - have been given by the lexicographer from his memory
 faltah anek sthalon main uddharanon kii ashuddhi is kosh kii ek truti ban gai
 But the error occurred due to the desire to finish the work in quick time at a fast pace
 pustak ekatra karnaa, uddhran pratilipi karnaa or unka sangyojan karnaa, aadi kaary itnaa shram-samay-saadhy tha jo saat barshon main ek vyakti ke dwaara sarvatha asambhav tha
 After this, by the end of the 18th century, many dictionaries were made in English
 wiliam karnik, wiliam peri, tamas sheridan or jaan vaakar ne uccharan aadi kii samasya ko sulajhane kaa praytn kiya
 These shells are called short or short version of 'jonson'
 uccharan kaa thik thik swaroop bataane kaa kaary samasyatmak tha
 Jansan or later lexicographers tried to solve it completely
 jon vaakar ne ukt disha main vishesh praytn kiya
 For these reasons, there was some criticism of Jonson's dictionary
 par 19 veen shatee ke purvardh se uskaa sanman bad gaya, uski mahatta sweekrut ho gai
 Additions of new words, meanings, citations etc
 to it, with the help of many scholars, revised and augmented versions of the dictionary were published

 In later editions, linguists revised them

 The second lexicographer of this era was Richardson

 He went beyond Janson - he quoted the writings of artists like Chasar, Gowar etc

 From practical point of view, this method did not become useful and convenient for readers wishing for semantics from the dictionary

 Yet sometimes there was uncertainty

 Dadabhai Naorozi and Major B
 Dutt was the third economic thinker along with D
 Basu to present authentic accounts of the damage done to the Indian economy under colonial rule and the famous 'drain Theory'
 iskaa matlab yah tha ki angrej apane laabh ke liye nirantar niryaat thopane or anaavashyak adhibhaar vasuulne ke jariye bhartiya arthvyavastha ko nichod rahe hai
 Ramesh Chandra Dutt was born in 1848 in a family in Kolkata who had acquired considerable wealth by doing business under the East India Company

 san 1897 se 1904 tak ye landan vishvavidhyalay main bhartiya itihaas ke praadhyaapak rahe
 He died in 1909
 apane gahan anusandhan or vishleshan se dutt ne dikhaaya ki british shashan na keval bharat kii bhautik sthiti sudhaarney main vifal rahaa, balki uske kaal main bharat kaa vi-udyogikaran hua
 As a result of British economic policy, India's handicrafts production fell drastically and industrial production did not increase as a compensation
 na hi bhartiya udyogon ko kisi bhi tarah kaa sangrakshan pradaan kiya gaya
 As a result, the Indian economy was forced to depend on agriculture more than ever before
 bhartiya samaaj kaa dehathikaran hota chalaa gaya
 Dutt said that India did not benefit from the perceived constructive steps of British colonialism
 angrezon dwaara shuru kiye gayi rail- parivahan ke kaaran parmparik parivahan sevaayen maari gayin or trainon kaa istemaal british kaarakaanon main bane maal kii dhulaai ke liye hota rahaa
 Dutt concluded that the Indian economy is not underdeveloped, but its growth has been stunted
 unke dwaara likhaa gaya itihaas vidwaanon ke ek hisse main prachlit us marxvaadi dharna ko jhuthlaata he jiske mutabik british upniveshwaad kii bhoomika pragatisheel tehraayi jaati he
 Apart from economic historian Ramesh Chandra Dutt was also a talented and skilled cultural historian
 bangeey sahitya parishad ke sansthaapak adhyaksh rahane ke saath-saath unhone mahabharat or ramayana kaa angrezi main sankshipt kavyanuwaad bhi kiya
 Based on the evidence of Sanskrit literature, Dutt also composed the history of ancient civilization of India
 british aarthik niti ke dushprinaamon par prakaash daalane ke alaava aarthik vichaaron ke vikaas main dutt kaa doosraa pramukh yogadan yah tha ki unhone arthvyavastha main sarkari hastkshep kii seemaa nirdhaarit karne kii vakaalat kii
 He recommended this in the early twentieth century at a time when other Indian economists were seeking to reduce the government's interference in economic life
 dutt kaa kahana tha ki sarkaar ko nijee pahalakadami ghataane vaale hastkshepon se bachanaa chahie, lekin khaas paristhitiyon main dakhsandaazi ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie taaki asthai kism ke sankaton se bachate hue hiton kaa takaraav taala ja sake
 Dutt's method of estimating the reality was also different in that era
 vaastaviktaa ke anek kaarnon main ek ko pramukh or dusron ko uskaa prabhaav maan kar chalane ke bajaay dutt ne aarthik or raajnneetik tathyon kii paraspar nirbharta kii avadharana viksit kii
 He believed that everything in the system of society is interdependent, interconnected, so nothing should be done like disturbing the balance
 lekin, saath main dutt yah bhi samajhate the ki santulan hameshaa ek jaisaa nahin rahata he
 He is constantly changing
 isliye sarkaar ko hastkshep karte samay kii fori sthiti kii antarnihit gatishiltaa par apana dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie, varanaa uske hastkshepkaaree kadamon kaa parinaam vipareet bhi nikal saktaa he
 The publication of Dutt's works on economics began in 1900
 unki pehali pustak thi bharat main padane vaale akalon kaa adhyayan karne vaali 'femins and land acesment in india' jisaki saraahna roosi araajaktaavaadi darshanik prince kropatakin ne bhi kii thi
 His work showed how interested he was in the living conditions of the Indian farmer and how his economic thinking was focused on improving his condition
 dutt ne sawaal uthaaya ki 1858 ke baad se chalis saal kii avadhi main bharat kii janata ko das bheeshan akalon kaa saamana kyon karnaa padaa? unhone poocha ki is dauraan hukumat east india company ke bajaay samraji ke haath main thi
 During this time there was usually peace and only one war took place
 hukumat ke paas prashikshit prashaasak the jinhen bhartiya paristhitiyon kaa paryaapt anubhav tha
 The land was fertile, farmers were entrepreneurs and economists
 aisi anukool paristhitiyon ke baavjood aisa kyon hua ki in akalon ke dauraan kareeb dedh karod log bhukh ke shikaar ho kar jaan se haath se dho baithe? dutt yah maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin hue ki akalon kaa kaaran aabaadi main tej rakrataar se hui badhotaree he yaa bharat ke kisaan laaparvaah, kahil or fizoolsearch hai
 He also did not accept that farmers being trapped under the clutches of usurers could be the cause of famine
 dutt ne apane adhyayan main dikhaaya ki bharat main aabaadi badhane kii raftaar england ke mukaable na keval hameshaa kam rahi, balki unke adhyayan se pehle ke das varshon main is desh kii aabaadi main badhotaree ruk hi gayi thi
 According to Dutt, more hardworking and less spending farmers than India are nowhere else in the world
 unhone akaal ke kaarnon kii jaanch karne vaale aayogon kii rapaton kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki sarkari rajasav kii kathortapurvak vasuuli ke kaaran hi kisaanon ko mahajanon par nirbhar hona padataa he
 Showing a mirror to the British government, Dutt demonstrated that despite the famine, there was no year when all the crops had fallen
 sarkari godaamon main anaaj hameshaa bharaa rahaa
 If the crop in one province has deteriorated, the crop has been good in another province
 kheti kaa vistaar hua he, vah saghan bhi hui he, pehle ke mukaable paidaavaar bhi badi he, khetihar upaj kii keemten bhi badi hai, par iske baad bhi kisaanon kii haalat lagaataar karaab hoti gayi he
 Dutt blamed British policies for this
 1902 main dutt ke mahaan granth 'da iconomic history of british india' kaa pehla khand prakashit hua
 It is known as the best text written on British rule
 isamen 1757 main angrezon kii satta kii sthapana se lekar samraji kii hukumat lagu hone tak kaa aarthik itihaas pesh kiya gaya tha
 It had an analytical account of policies related to farming and land settlement, trade and factory production policies as well as finance and administration policies adopted under the East India Company
 pustak ke british samikshakon ne bhi isaki nishpakshta or gaharaai kaa loha mana
 In 1904, the second volume of this epic was published
 unhone pramanik tathyon ke aadhaar par daawa kiya ki british shashan ke praarambhik varshon main apanaayi gayi swarthpurna nitiyaan bhartiya udyogon ke patan ke liye zimmedaar rahi hai
 Dutt, highlighting the causes of poverty in India, proved that the British industry had to destroy the indigenous industries and handicrafts
 lakhon log berojgaar ho gayi jisase jivan-yaapan ke liye unke saamne kheti ke alaava koi or chaara nahin rah gaya
 In this way, the number of people living on the basis of agriculture increased and the standard of living of all fell
 iske saath-saath angrez bharat par hukumat karne ke liye baari dhan karchate rahe jiskaa mulk ko koi faaydaa nahin pahunchaa
 The fiscal policy and the land revenue system were made in such a way that only the surviving resources remained with the farmer
 dutt ke paas in samasyaon kaa ilaaj karne kaa nuskhaa bhi tha
 He recommended that the excise duty should be removed from the Indian mill industry, farmers should be rid of all taxes other than the soft taxation of low rates, military and royal expenditure in England should not be recovered from India and also in India Expenses should be reduced dutt ne jaise hi ye suzav diye, british hukumat or uske himytiyon ne unki chautarfa aalochana shuru kar di
 An attempt was made to dismiss his facts and analysis
 dhyaan rahe ki dutt indian civil services ke varisht adhikari the or british shashan kii seva karne ke daayitv se bandhe hue the
 However, he continued to argue with his opponents and urged the government to change the policies to improve India's economic condition
 inaki vilakshan pratibha keval prashasnic kaaryon tak hi simit nahin thi, varan ye moulik lekhak tathaa itihasajna bhi the
 At the beginning of his writing, he wrote in English, but later also composed in Bengali with the influence of Bankim Chandra

 ek internet protocol adress ek sankhyatmak label he jo apane nodes ke bich sanchaar ke liye internet protocol kaa prayog karanevaale computer network main bhaag le rahe divices ko abantit kiya jaataa he
 An IP address performs two major functions: host or network interface identification and location detection
 The characterization of its role is as follows: “A name indicates what we ask for
 ek pataa ingit karata he ki vah kahan he
 a route indicates how to get there
 " TCP / IP ke diziner ne IP adress ko ek 32-bit nambar ke rup main paribhaashit kiya or internet protocal varjan 4 yaa ipv4 ke naam se jaani janevaali yah pranali, aaj bhi upyog main he
 However, due to the extensive development of the Internet and consequently the lack of available addresses, a new detection system using 128 bits for addresses was developed in 1995 and last standardized by RFC 2460 in 1998
 haalanki IP adress dwiadhari sankhya ke rup main jamaa kiye jate he, vah aamtaur par maanviya-pathyogy chihnkaree jaise 208

 The Internet protocol also sends data packets between networks; The IP address specifies the location of the source and destination nodes in the topology of the routing system
 is prayojan ke liye, ek IP adress ke kuch bits ek sab-network abhinihit karne ke liye istemaal kiye jate hai
 The number of these bits is indicated in CIDR notation, appended to the IP address, such as 208

 jaise hi nijee network ke vikaas ne ipv4 adress ke samaapan ke khatre ko uthaaya, RFC 1918 ne nijee adress sthaan kaa ek samooh nirdhaarit kiya jo nijee network par kisi ke bhi dwaara istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 They are often used with network address translators to connect to the global public Internet
 da internet asind number athurity, jo saarvbhaumik IP adress sthaan niyatan prabandh karata he, sthaneey internet registry or anya sansthaaon ko IP khand aabantan karne ke liye, paanch kshetreey internet registry ko sahyog detaa he
 Two versions of the Internet protocol are in use: IP version 4 and IP version 6
 See version history
) Each version defines an IP address differently
 uski vyapaktaa ke kaaran, saamaanya shabd ypi adress aam taur par ab bhi ipv4 dwaara paribhaashit adress ko sanderbhit karata he
 ipv4 uses a 32-bit address, which limits the address space to 4,294,967,296) possible unique addresses
 ipv4 kuch adress, vishesh prayojanon jaise nijee network yaa bahustrpiya adress ke liye arakshit karata he
 This reduces the number of addresses to be assigned to end-users and as the number of available addresses decays, ipv4 address completion becomes fixed
 yah purvaabhaasi kami ipv6 viksit karne ke liye praathmik prerana thi, jo duniya bhar main vibhinn tainaati charnon main he or ipv4 pratisthaapan or internet ke lagaataar vistaar ke liye akeli ranneeti he
 ipv4 addresses are usually represented in dot-decimal notation
 prayek bhaag adress ke 8 bit kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or isliye ocotate kahalaaya jaataa he
 In less common cases of technical writing, ipv4 addresses can be presented in hexadecimal, octal, or binary representations
 sarvaadhik pratinidhitiv main prayek ocotate vyaktigat rup se badla jaataa he
 In the initial phase of Internet Protocol development, network administrators described the IP address in two parts, the network number portion and the host number portion
 The highest order octet in an address was designated a network number, and the remaining bits were called rest fields or host identifiers and were used for internal host numbering of the network
 yah paddati jald hi annuroop sabit hui jaise hi atirikt network viksit hue jo maujuuda network se svachhand the, jinhen pehle se hi ek network sankhya dwaara abhinihit kiya hota tha
 In 1981, the Internet addressing specification was revised with the inclusion of a classful network structure
 classphul network dizine ek badi sankhya ke liye vyaktigat network kaary kii anumati detaa tha
 The first three bits of the most important octet of an IP address were defined as a range of addresses
 saarvbhaumik unicast parichayan ke liye teen shreneeyaan paribhaashit kii gai
 Network identification based on derived class was based on octet boundary areas of the entire address
 prayek shrenee network pahachanakarta main kramshah atirikt octate kaa upyog karti thi, is prakaar se ucch varg shrenee main sambhav mejabaanon kii sankhya kam ho jaati he
 The following table gives an overview of the system thus obsolete
 'sabanetwork' or 'classphul network' lekh main is abhikalp kaa vivaran samajhaayaa gaya he
 Although the classful network design was a successful developmental stage, wild Internet expansion made it difficult to move forward and when classless inter-domain routing was created to provide new IP address segments and use ipv4 addresses for routing protocols
 When new rules were prepared for, it was dropped
 swecchit-lambaai upsargon kaa aabantan evam anumaargan karwaane ke liye siidiar veriable-lenth sabanet masking par aadhaarit he
 Today, the residuals of the classful network concept operate only in a limited area, which is the default configuration parameter of some network software and hardware components and is used in technical discussions of network administrators
 aarambhik network abhikalp main jab sanchaar ke liye sabhi internet prayogkartaaon ke bich vaishvik str par ek chaur se duusare chaur tak jodne kii baat sochi gai to yah lakshya tha ki prayek computer yaa upkaran kaa ek vishisht ypi pataa ho
 But it was found that it is not always possible to do so as private networks developed and public addresses needed to be conserved
 jo computer internet se nahin jude hai, jaise ki kaarkaane kii mashine jo tisipi / ypi ke madhyam se keval aapas main sanchaar karti hai, unke liye vaishvik taur par vishisht ypi pataa hona jaruri nahin he
 For private networks three of the ipv4 addresses, one limit for each class, were reserved in the 1918 RFC
 in paton kaa margan internet par nahin kiya jaataa or isliye inkaa prayog ypi paton kii panji ke saath samanvit karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Today, when needed, such private networks usually connect to the Internet through network address translation

 Despite the preservation techniques, the rapid completion of the ipv4 address space prompted the Internet Engineering Task Force to explore new technologies to expand the Internet's addressing capabilities
 iskaa sthaayee samaadhaan, internet protocol kaa hi ek nayaa swaroop, samajha tha
 This next generation of Internet Protocol, intended to replace ipv4 on the Internet, was eventually renamed Internet Protocol version 6 in 1995
 pataa aakaar 32 se badha kar 128 bit yaa 16 ocotate kar diya gaya, jo, network block ke ek udaar kaam ke saath bhi, nikat bhavishya ke liye paryaapt mana jaataa he
 Mathematically, the new address space provides a capacity of up to 2, or approximately 3
403 × 10 unique addresses
 nayaa dizin keval adress kii paryaapt maatra pradaan karne ke lakshya par aadhaar nahin he, balki sabanet anumaargan upsargon ke kushal ekatrikaran ko anumaargan nodes par hone kii anumati dene ke liye
 As a result, the routing table size is small and the smallest possible individual allocation is a subnet for 264 hosts, which is square of the size of the entire ipv4 Internet
 in staron par, vaastavik adress upyog dar kisi bhi ipv6 network khand par chota hoga
 The new design also provides the opportunity to isolate the addressing infrastructure of a network segment — which is the local administration of the segment's available space — from an addressing prefix used to route external traffic to a network
 ipv6 main aisi suvidhaayen he jo, yadi vaishvik sampark yaa anumaargan niti main parivartan ho, to bina aantarik nae swaroop yaa nae sankhyankan ke swatah hi puure network kaa anumaargan upsarg badal detii hai
 The large number of ipv6 addresses allows large blocks to be specified for specific purposes and, where appropriate, to be aggregated for efficient routing
 ek bade adress sthaan ke saath ek jatil pataa sangrakshan takanic kii jarurat nahin hoti, jaise clasles inter-domen rooting main upyog kii jaati he
 According to Submodern, desktop and enterprise server operating systems include seamless support for the ipv6 protocol, but are not yet widely deployed in other devices such as home networking routers, voice over internet protocols, and multimedia devices and network peripherals
 ek ipv6 pate kaa udhaaharan: As ipv4 reserves addresses for private or internal networks, ipv6 has separate sets of addresses for private addresses
 ipv6 main, in ko unic local adress ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 RFC 4,193 sets the routing prefix fc00 :: / 7 separately for this department, which is divided into two / 8 departments with different available policies
 The address includes a 40-bit pseudorandom number of site mergers or packets
 Addresses on the wrong route reduce the risk of encounter
 aarambhik dizin is prayojan ke liye ek alag khand kaa prayog karte the, dabd site-sthaneey adress
 haalanki, site kaa gathan kis se hota he, isaki paribhaasha aspasht rahi or kharaab paribhaashit parichayan niti ne anumaargan main sandigdhta bana di
 The address range specification has been abandoned and should no longer be used in the new system
 fe80 se shuru hote pate: - link-local adress kahalaaye jane vaale - keval sthaneey link kshetra main niyat kiye jate hai
 Addresses are usually generated automatically by the IP layer of the operating system for each network interface

 This feature is used extensively and indirectly for most users in the lower layers of ipv6 network administration

 jab ek computer har baar ek hi ai pi adress kaa prayog karne ke liye samanurup kiya jaataa he to vah tej ho jaataa he, ise static IP adress kehete hai
 Conversely, in cases when the computer's IP address is assigned automatically, it is known as a dynamic IP address
 static IP adress ek vyavasthaapak dwaara haath se computer ko saunpa he
 Its exact process varies by platform
 yah dinemic ai pi adress se asaadrishy hai, jo yaa to computer interphes yaa swayam host software, jaise xeronkonf main, dwaara nirdisht hote he yaa dinemic host kanfigreshna protocol ke istemaal se ek sarwar dwaara nirdisht kiye hote he
 Although IP addresses specified using DHCP remain the same for long periods of time, they can usually change
 kuch maamalon main, ek network vyavasthaapak sakriy rup se nirdisht static IP adress lagu kar saktaa hai
 In this case, a DHCP server is used, but it is specifically tailored to always assign the same IP address to a specific computer
 yah static IP adress ko mukhya rup se samanurup hone kii anumati detaa he, jisamen network par prayek computer ko hastchalit pranali dwaara vishesh rup se samanurup karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati
 In the absence or failure of a static or stateful address configuration, an operational system can assign an IP address to a network interface using state-less automatic-configuration techniques, such as Xeroconf
 gatisheel ypi pate dinemic host kanfigareshan protocol sarvaron dwaara atyadhik praayah lans or broadband network par niyukt hote hai
 They are used because they can avoid the administrative burden of assigning specific static addresses for each device on a network

 gatisheel IP adress nirdisht karne ke liye DHCP hi akeli takanic nahin he
 Dialup and some broadband networks use dynamic address characteristics of point-to-point protocols
 ek stick dinemic IP adress yaa stick ypi cabel or DSL internet adhigam bhugtankarta dwaara ek gatyaatmakataa se niyukt ypi adress jisamen aksar badlaav nahin aata, uskaa varnan karne ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Addresses are usually assigned with the DHCP protocol
 chunki modem aamtaur par vistaarit avadhi ke samay ke liye yantrachaalit hote hai, isliye adress patte aksar lambey samay ke liye niyamit kiye jate hai or samaapti hone par naveekrut kar die jate hai
 If a modem is turned off and the address is re-operated before the next termination of the lease, it is most likely that it will receive the same IP address

 In ipv6, each interface using static or dynamic address functions automatically receives a local-link address in the fe80 :: / 10 subnet
 ye adress keval link par vaid hote hai, jaise ek sthaneey network khand yaa binduvaar conection jisase koi host judaa hua ho
 These addresses are not routable and cannot be the source or destination of Internet packet blocking like private addresses

 Multiple client tools can be displayed to use an IP address: either because it is part of a shared hosting web server environment or because an ipv4 network address translator or proxy server acts as an intermediary on behalf of its clients In this case, the actual IP address generated may be hidden from the server receiving the request

 The demon king Bali compromised with Devraj Indra and got ready for churning the sea
 mandarachal parvat ko mathni tathaa vasuki naag ko neti banaaya gaya
 The leader emerged from Vasuki's eye
 swayan bhagwaan shri vishnu kacchap avatar lekar mandarachal parvat ko apane peeth par rakhkar uskaa aadhaar ban gayi
 Lord Narayana exerted power demonically in the demons and devoutly in the gods
 vasuki naag ko bhi gahan nidra de kar uske ksht ko har liya
 The god began to hold Vasuki Nag on his face
 is par ulti buddhi vaale daitya, asur, daanavaadi ne sochaa ki vasuki naag ko mukh kii ore se pakadaney main avashya kuch na kuch laabh hoga
 He told the gods that we are not inferior in power to anyone, we will take the place of mouth
 tab devataaon ne vasuki naag ke punch kii ore kaa sthaan le liya
 "the sea churning began and the Mandarachal mountain began to roam on the broad back of the Lord Kachhapa
 he rajan! samudr manthan se sabase pehle jal kaa halaahal vish niklaa
 All the gods and demons started burning with the flame of that poison and their ears began to fade
 is par sabhi ne milakar bhagwaan shankar kii prarthana kii
 On his prayer, Mahadev ji kept the poison on his palm and drank it but did not let it come down from the gorge
 us kalkut vish ke prabhaav se shiv ji kaa kanth nila pad gaya
 That is why Mahadev ji is called Neelkanth
 unki hatheli se thodaa sa vish prithvi par tapak gaya tha jise saanp, bichchhu aadi vifaille jantuon ne grahan kar liya
 "after consuming the poison by Lord Shankar, the ocean churning started again
 doosraa ratna kamdhenu gaay nikali jise rishiyon ne rakh liya
 Then a high horse came out which was kept by Daityaraja Bali
 uske baad airavat hathi niklaa jise devraj indra ne grahan kiya
 After Airavat, Lord Vishnu kept it out of the sea of kaustubhamani
 phir kalpavriksha niklaa or rambha naamak apsara nikali
 These two were kept in heaven
 aage phir samudr ko mathne se lakshmi ji nikaleen
 Laxmi ji got married to Lord Vishnu himself
 uske baad kanya ke rup main vaaruni prakat hai jise daityon ne grahan kiya
 Then after one moon, Parijat tree and conch came out and in the end Dhanvantari Vaidya appeared after taking the nectar
 "dhanvantari ke haath se amrit ko daityon ne chin liya or uske liye aapas main hi ladane lage
 The gods did not have the power to curse Durvasa so that they could fight the demons and take that nectar, so they stood frustrated and watched them fight among themselves
 devataaon kii niraashaa ko dekhakar bhagwaan vishnu tatkaal mohini rup dhaaran kar aapas main ladate daityon ke paas ja pahunche
 Seeing that Vishwamohini form, what is the matter of the demons and the Gods, the Brahmins, the devouring Kamdev himself, Lord Shankar too were fascinated and looked at him again and again
 jab daityon ne us navyauvana sundari ko apni ore aate huye dekha tab ve apana sara jhagada bhul kar usee sundari kii ore kamaskt hokar ekatak dekhne lage
 The monster said, "oh beautiful! Who are you? Looks like we are being sarcastic on us only to settle our dispute
 aao shubhage! tumhaara swaagat he
 Make us beautiful and make this nectar with lotus
 " is par vishwamohini rupi vishnu ne kaha, "he devataaon or daanvon! aap donon hi maharishi kashyap ji ke putr hone ke kaaran bhai-bhai ho phir bhi paraspar ladate ho
 i am an arbitrary woman
 budhimaan log aisi stri par kabhi vishwaas nahin karte, phir tum log kaise mujh par vishwaas kar rahe ho? acha yahi he ki swayan sab mil kar amritpan kar lo
 " vishwamohini ke aise niti kushal vachan sun kar un kamandh daityo, daanvon or asuron ko us par or bhi vishwaas ho gaya
 He said, "beautiful! We have full faith in you
 tum jis prakaar baantogi ham usee prakaar amritpan kar lenge
 Take this event and distribute nectar among all of us
 " vishwamohini ne amrit ghat lekar devataaon or daityon ko alag-alag panktiyo main baithne ke liye kaha
 After that, the demons plastered with their sarcasm and began to make nectar to the gods
 daitya unke kataaksh se aise madahosh huye ki amrit pinaa hi bhul gayi
 God considered this trick as a monster named Rahu
 vah devtaa kaa rup bana kar devataaon main jaakar baith gaya or praapt amrit ko mukh main daal liya
 When the nectar reached its gorge, the moon and the sun called out and said that it is Rahu monster
 yah sunakar bhagwaan vishnu ne tatkaal apane sudarshan chakra se uskaa sir gardan se alag kar diya
 Due to the effect of nectar, his head and torso became two planets named Rahu and Ketu and were established in space
 ve hi bair bhav ke kaaran surya or chandramaa kaa grahan karaate hai
 In this way, Lord Vishnu was omitted from there by giving nectar to the gods
 unke lop hote hi daityon kii madhoshi samaapt ho gai
 They became very angry and started attacking the gods
 bhayankar devasur sangram armbh ho gaya jisamen devraj indra ne daityaraj baali ko parrast kar apana indralok waapas le liya

 street drive yaa 'rail: gend ko bagal kii diwaar ke samanaantar or kareeb maaraa jaataa he taaki vah court ke gahare peeche tak jaae 
 ise aksar ek 'good length' shot ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 2
 Boast: The ball is played in an angle on the side wall or on the back wall before hitting the ball against the front wall
 3
 woli: gend ko 'puraa' maaraa jaataa he, aamtaur par sidhe saamne kii diwaar par
 4
 Drop shot: The ball is hit comfortably on the front wall, so that it falls gently on the floor into the front corner
 5
 lob: gend ko ek ucch arq ke saath saamne kii diwaar par dhime or ooncha maaraa jaataa he, taaki vah court ke pichley kone main gire
 6
 Cross Court: The ball is hit from the right side to the left on the front wall
 7
 kil: gend ko saamne kii diwaar par jor se or neeche maaraa jaataa he taaki vah court ke aadhe hisse se aage tak na aa paae
 8
 Trickle Boast: a 'small' boast where the ball is hit on the side wall, in front of the court
 9
 squies bost: apekshaakrit ek kathin shot jise court ke saamne se maaraa jaataa he jab gend bagal vaali diwaar ke bilkul kareeb hoti he
 It has the same effect as a trickle boast, but is more confusing due to its difficulty
 10
 skid bost: gend ko saamne kii diwaar ke paas bagal vaali diwaar par ooncha maaraa jaataa he taaki vah court se hote hue, vipareet peeche vaale kone main gire
 11
 Nick shot: The ball is 'volleyed' or hit on a bounce, cross court and with so much force that it hits the front wall then through the junction of the adjacent wall and from the floor
 When hit well, there is little or no bounce in the ball and it rolls along the floor
 ek aam ranneeti he gend ko bagal kii deevaaron par se sidhe peeche ke konon par upar maarna; yah buniyadi squash shot he, ise ek "rail", street drive, wal, yaa "lenth" ke rup main sanderbhit karte hai
 After hitting this shot, the player moves to the "T" in the center of the court so that he is in a better position to face the opponent's return
 saamne ke konon main halake yaa "laghu" shot ke saath hamalaa karne ke parinamswaroop pratidwandvi ko court kaa adhikansh hissaa aavrutt karnaa padataa he, jisase vijeta kaa parinaam turant nikal saktaa he
 The boast or angle shot is deliberately hit on the side wall before reaching the front of the ball
 is shot ko dhokhe ke liye or pratidwandvi ko phir se adhikansh court ko aavrutt karne ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 a dominant strategy in squash is to "dominate T"
 Skilled players will return the shot and then return to the "T" before playing the next shot
 From this position, the player can quickly use any part of the court with minimal antics to get the opponent's next shot
 anbhavi khilaadiyon ke bich reliyon main 30 yaa adhik shot ho sakate hai or isliye fitness par vishesh jor diya jaataa he, aerobics or gaiyr-aerobics, donon par
 jaise-jaise khilaadi adhik kushal ho jate hai, vishesh rup se, shot ko praapt karne main behatar ho jate hai to ank praapt karnaa, aksar sangharshan kaa yuddh ban jaataa he
 At higher levels of the game, a more fit player is in a better position
 aakhri pal main gend kii disha badalane kii kshamta bhi, pratidwandvi ko asantulit karne ke liye mahatvapurn he
 Expert players can detect an opponent's shot in the tenth of a second with more acuity than an average player, allowing them to react quickly
 chunki do khilaadiyon ko ek saajha sthaan ke bheetar hi simit kar diya jaataa he, hastkshep or baadha is khel ke anivaary pahalu hote hai
 Normally, the rule requires the player to see clearly before hitting the ball against the front wall, to face the ball in a straight line, a proper rotation of any part of the court and an uninterrupted shot, Whether in front, on the side, or on the back wall to which they are capable, they are entitled
 jab hastkshep hota he, to ek khilaadi ek "let" ke liye apil kar saktaa he or referi hastkshep kii seemaa kii vyakhya karata he
 The referee may choose to allow a lay and then have the player replay that point, or may provide a "stroke" to the appealing player, depending on the level of interference, the referee observes
 The intervening player made enough efforts to protect it and whether the disrupted player was likely to take a decisive shot if he was not interrupted
 is sab ke liye ek apwaad tab hota he jab hastkshep karne vaala khilaadi duusare khilaadi kii harakat ke raste main sidhe hota he or vah prabhavi rup se us harakat ko roak detaa he, to aise maamle main hameshaa ek stroke pradaan kiya jaataa he
 When it is understood that the impediment was too low or not, or both, it is impossible to tell, as a rule, to provide a lat to maintain the continuity of the game and discourage fake appeals for the lat
 Should not be allowed
 kyonki hastkshep kii prakruti or uski tivrata kii vyakhya main vyaktiparak lakshan ke kaaran, let or stroke kaa pradaan aksar vivaadaaspad hota he
 It is considered an interference when a player's shot touches his opponent before being hit on the front wall
 pratidwandvi ko lagane se pehle yadi gend bagal vaali diwaar kii ore ja rahi thi yaa yadi yah pehle hi bagal vaali diwaar se takaraa chuki he or ab saamne kii diwaar kii taraf sidhe bad rahi he to yah aam taur par ek let hota he
 However, it is a stroke for the player who hit the ball if the ball was moving directly towards the front wall and hit the opponent before hitting the adjacent wall
 aam taur par ek khilaadi ko gend lagane ke baad, donon khilaadi sthir khadey ho jate hai, yadi vah khilaadi jise gend lagi he, gend ko maarane vaale khilaadi ke sidhe saamne khadaa he to vah stroke kho detaa he or yadi vah saamne nahin khadaa he, to ek let khelaa jaataa he
 If it is understood that the player hitting the ball is deliberately trying to hit his opponent, he will lose the stroke
 in sab kaa ek apwaad tab hota he jab gend ko maarane vaala khilaadi "ternd" ho jaae, yani, gend use ek taraf se paas kar jaati he, lekin jab vah peeche kii diwaar se waapas aati he tab vah use martha he
 In these cases, the stroke goes to the player who got the ball
 duniya bhar main khele jane vaale squash ke kai rup hai
 In America, hardball singles and doubles are played on relatively stiff balls and different size courts
 Hardball has lost much of its popularity in North America, but the game of hardball doubles is still active
 maanak gend se khele jane vaale squash kaa ek dubles sanskaran bhi he, kabhi-kabhi ek vyapak court ke saath or tennis se miltaa-julata swaroop jise squash tennis ke rup main janaa jaataa he
