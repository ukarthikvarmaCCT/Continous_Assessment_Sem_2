 Meiosis in animals always results in the formation of gametes, while in other organisms it can produce spores
 sutrivibhaajan kii tarah hi, ardhasutrivibhaajan ke shuru hone ke pehle moulik koshika kaa diene koshika-chakra ke S-pravastha main doharaa ho jaataa he
 These double chromosomes break into four haploid gametes or spores by two cell divisions
 ardhasutrivibhaajan langik prajnan ke liye aavashyak hota he or isaliye yah sabhi eucaryociton main hota he
 Some eukaryotes, especially beadloid rotifers, do not have the ability to meiosis and reproduce by parthenogenesis
 aarkia yaa bacteria main ardhasutrivibhaajan nahin hota or ve binary vikhandan jaisi langik prakriyaaon dwaara prajnan karte hai
 At the time of meiosis, the genome of a diploid germ cell, which is composed of long segments of DNA filled in chromosomes, consists of DNA repeats and then two rounds of division, producing four haploid cells
 inamen se prayek koshika main moulik koshika ke chromosomon kaa ek sampurna set yaa uski jin-saamagree kaa aadha bhaag hota he
 If meiosis occurs from gametes, these cells combine at conception to form a new diploid cell or ligand before any other development
 is prakaar ardhasutrivibhaajan kii vibhaajan kii prakriya garbhaadhan ke samay do jeenomon ke sanyog ke prati hone vaali anyonya prakriya hoti he
 Since the chromosomes of each parent are homologous recombinations during meiosis, the DNA of each gamete and each zygote contains a unique symbolic framework
 ardhasutrivibhaajan or garbhaadhan, dono milakar eucaryociton main langikta kaa pradurbhaav karte hai or janasamudaayon main vishisht jinagunon vaale vyaktiyon kii utpatti karte hai
 In all plants and many protists, meiosis results in the formation of haploid cells called spores that can divide asexually without conception
 in samoohon main yugmak sutrivibhaajan dwaara utpann hote hai
 Meiosis uses many of the same biochemical methods used in mitosis to redistribute chromosomes
 ardhasutrivibhaajan kii anek anuthi visheshtaayen hoti hai, jinamein samadharmi chromosomon kaa jodikaran or punahsanyog sabase mahatvapurn he
 The root of the word meiosis is meyo, which means less or less
 ardhasutrivibhaajan kii khoj 1876 main prakhyat german jeevvaigyanik askar hartwig ne samudri saahi ke andon main kii or pehali baar uskaa vivaran diya
 The Belgian biologist Edward Van Beneden again described it at the level of chromosomes in the eggs of Ascaris in 1883
 prajnan or anuvanshikta main ardhasutrivibhaajan ke mahatv ke bare main sabase pehle 1890 main german jeevvaigyanik august villman ne bataaya, jinhone kaha ki yadi chromosomon kii sankhya ko banaae rakhana ho to ek dwiguneet koshika ko chaar agunit koshikaon main parivartit karne ke liye do koshika vibhaajanon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In 1911, American genealogist Thomas Hunt Morgan observed crossover in meiosis of Drosophilia melanogaster and provided the first genetic evidence that genes are transmitted on chromosomes
 ardhasutrivibhaajan kaa pradurbhaav 1
4 billian varshon purv hua, aisa mana jaataa he
 Only all organisms in a supergroup of eukaryotes called exkaveta do not have meiosis
 anya paanchon mukhya supergrupon, apisthokant, amibazoa, riveeria, arkiplastida or krockelviyoleton main sabhi main ardhasutrivibhaajan kii jine saarvbhaumik rup se maujuud rahati hai, chaahe ve hameshaa sakriy na hoti hon
 kuch exceveta jatiyon main bhi ardhasutrivibhaajan hota he jisase is anumaan ko samarthan miltaa he ki yah ek pracheen, paraphilatic shrenee kaa samooh he
 An example of a eukaryotic organism that does not have meiosis is euglenide
 eukarotic jivan chakron ke langik prajnan ke samay ardhasutrivibhaajan hota he, jisamen ardhasutrivibhaajan or garbhaadhan kii lagaataar chakree prakriya hoti rahati he
 This continues simultaneously with normal mitosis
 bahukoshiya jeevon main dwiguneet se agunit main parivartankaal ke bich ek madhyasth paaydaan hoti he jahaan jeev kaa vikaas hota he
 The organism then produces germ cells that continue throughout the life cycle
 shesh koshikaayen, jinhen daihik koshikaayen kaha jaataa he, jeev ke bheetar kaary karti hai or uske saath marati he
 The haploid and diploid conditions are repeated alternately due to the cycle of meiosis and conception
 jivan-chakra kii jaivik avasthaa dwiguneet dasha, agunit dasha, yaa dono main ho sakati he
 In this way, there are three types of life-cycles that use sexual reproduction, according to the place of biological conditions
 yugmak jivan-chakra main, jo manushyon main bhi hota he, jati dwiguneet hoti he or yugmaj naamak dwiguneet koshika se viksit hoti he
 The diploid germ-line stem cells of the organism form haploid gametes by meiosis that combine to form zygotes
 dwiguneet yugmaj kaa sutrivibhaajan dwaara anek baar koshika-vibhaajan hokar jeev kaa vikaas hota he
 Mitosis is a process related to meiosis that creates two cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell
 saamaanya siddhant yah he ki sutrivibhaajan se daihik koshikaayen or ardhasutrivibhaajan se janan koshikaayen utpann hoti hai
 In the zygotic life cycle, the species is haploid, resulting from the proliferation and differentiation of a single haploid cell called the zygote
 bhinn lingon ke do jeev apni agunit janan koshikaayen pradaan karke ek dwiguneet yugmaj kaa nirmaan karte hai
 This zygote immediately undergoes meiosis, creating four haploid cells
 ye koshikaayen sutrivibhaajan dwaara jeev kaa nirmaan karti hai
 Many fungi and protozoa are members of the zygotic life cycle
 bijaanu jivan-chakra main, jeev main agunit or dwiguneet dashaaen baari-baari se hoti hai
 Therefore, this cycle is also called the alternation of generations
 dwiguneet jeev kii janan-rekha koshikaon kaa ardhasutrivibhaajan hokar bijaanuon kii utpatti hoti he
 These spores grow by mitosis and develop into a haploid organism
 phir agunit jeev kii janan koshikaayen anya agunit jeev kii koshikaon se sanyukt hokar yugmaj kaa nirmaan karti hai
 The zygote undergoes repeated mitosis and proliferation to develop a diploid organism again
 bijaanu jivan-chakra ko yugmak or yugmaj jivan-chakron kaa sangyojan kaha ja saktaa hai
 Since meiosis is a 'one-way' process, it cannot be assumed to be converged in the cell cycle like mitosis
 lekin ardhasutrivibhaajan ke pehle uski taiyaari ke sopanon ke prakaar or naam sutrivibhaajak koshika chakra ke interfez ke samaan hi hote hai
 There are three stages of interfaces - interfez ke baad ardhasutrivibhaajan i or phir ardhasutrivibhaajan II hota he
 In meiosis I, pairs of homologous chromosomes made up of two sister chromatids are separated and converted into two cells
 prayek kanya koshika main chromosomon kii ek sampurna agunit maatra hoti he; pehla ardhasutrivibhaajan moulik koshika kii gunitha ko 2 ke gunak se gata detaa he
 In meiosis II, the sibling strands of each chromosome are separated and individual chromatids break up into haploid female cells
 ardhasutrivibhaajan i se utpann do koshikaayen ardhasutrivibhaajan II ke samay vibhajit hoti hai, jisase 4 agunit kanya koshikaon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Meiosis i and II are divided into prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, with the same meaning as those in the synapses of the mitosis cell cycle
 isaliye, ardhasutrivibhaajan main ardhasutrivibhaajan i or ardhasutrivibhaajan II kii avasthaaen shaamil hoti he
 Meiosis produces genetic diversity in two ways, independent alignments and then the separation of pairs of homologous chromosomes at the time of first meiosis, allowing each pair of chromosome segregates to have infinite and free choice in homologous regions and homologous chromosomal regions by homologous recombination in prophase I
 Transitioning within chromosomes via physical exchange Form new combinations of NA
 ardhasutrivibhaajan i samarupi chromosomon kaa pruthakkikaran karke do agunit koshikaon kaa nirmaan karata he, isaliye ise rinatmak vibhaajan kaha jaataa he
 a regular diploid human cell has 46 chromosomes and is considered 2N because it contains 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes
 lekin ardhasutrivibhaajan i ke baad, haalanki koshika main 46 chromated hota hai, phir bhi use 23 chromosomayukt n mana jaataa he
 This occurs because later in anaphase I, the pair remain together when the protagonist draws the chromatids toward the poles of the new cell
 ardhasutrivibhaajan II main sutrivibhaajan ke samaan samikarni vibhaajan hota he, jisase sahodara chromated antat vibhajit ho jate hai or pehle vibhaajan se utpann prati kanya koshika se kul 4 agunit koshikaon kii utpatti hoti he
 In prophase I, DNA is exchanged between homologous chromosomes by a process called homologous recombination
 isse akasar chromosomiy crassovar hota he
 New combinations of DNA formed at the time of crossover are important sources of genetic changes and can generate new profitable combinations of alleles
 yugal or dohare chromosome baiwalent yaa tetrod kehalaate hai, jinamein do chromosome or chaar chromated hote hai, har mata-pita se ek chromosome praapt hota he
 At this stage, crossover of Asaadhara chromatids can occur at points called kyazma
 profez i kii pehali dasha leptotin dasha he, jise leptonima bhi kaha jaataa he
 At this stage, the chromosome alone condenses into longer parts within the nucleus
 parantu dono sahodara chromated abhi bhi itane balpurvak bandhe hota hai ki unhen ek duusare se alag nahin pahachaanaa ja saktaa
 In the zygotene condition, also known as zygonima, the chromosomes accumulate in a nearby line in the form of homologous chromosome pairs
 ise guladasta dasha kaha jaataa he, kyonki tilomir iske sadrush kendrak ke ek sire par ekatrit ho jate hai
 In this case, homologous chromosomes are ubiquitinated
 packitine dasha main, jise packinima bhi kehete hai, nimna chromosomiy crossover hote hai
 Non-homologous chromatids of homologous chromosomes randomly exchange parts of genetic information over homologous regions
 kintu langik chromosome puri tarah se ek samaan nahin hote hai or samaroopita ke chote se kshetra par hi jaankaree kaa vinimay karte hai
 The exchange takes place at places where recombination bales are formed
 asahodara chromatidon ke bich jaankaree kaa vinimay hone se jaankaree kaa punahsangyojan hota he; prayek chromosome main jaankaree kaa vahi purna set dota he, jo uske paas pehle tha or is prakriya ke kaaran koi trutiyaan nahin hotin
 chunki syneptonimal complex main chromosomon ko nahin pahachaanaa ja saktaa he, isaliye cross-over ko vaastavik rup se microscope se nahin dekha ja saktaa
 In the diplotene condition, also known as diplonema, the Greek word, ie - 'two threads') the synaptonymal complex is degraded and homologous chromosomes are slightly distant from each other
 chromosome swayan bhi kuch khul jate hai jisase diene kaa kuch pratilekhan ho jaataa he
 However, the homologous chromosomes of each bivalent are forcefully bound to the regions of crossingover, kismata
 kiyasmata anaafez i main pruthak hone tak chromosomon par bane rahete hai
 All the ovaries developing in human embryonic ovulation develop up to this stage and develop before birth
 yah nilambit avasthaa dictotine dasha kehalaati he or yah yauvanarambh tak aise hi rahati he
 In males, only spermatozoa remain until the onset of meiosis at puberty
 dyakainosis avasthaa main, jiskaa greek main arth ‘sthanantaran’ hota he, chromosome or sanghanit hote hai
 This meiosis is actually the first point where the four parts of the tetrads are visible
 paar uljhaana ek saath, prabhavi rup se ativyapee kii citen, chiasmata spasht rup se dikhaai bana rahi he
 Except this, the rest of this condition is exactly the same as prometaphase of mitosis, the subcenters disappear, the centripetal membrane changes into vesicles and the meiosis begins to form
 in dashaon main, pashu koshikaon ke tarak kendrakon kii jodiyukt do tarak kaay koshika ke dono dhruvon kii ore visthapit ho jate hai
 These asterisks that were replicated in the S-phase serve as microtubule organization centers centralizing the microtubules, which are actually cellular ropes and poles
 sookshmanalikaayen kendrak kshetra main kendrak aavaran ke nasht hone ke baad akraman karti hai or chromosomon ko gunasutrabindu se jodti hai
 The chromosome acts like a motor — it pulls the chromosomes along the attached microtubules toward the asteroid, like a train on track
 prayek tetrod main chaar gunasutrabindu hote hai, lekin prayek sahodara chromated par gunasutrabinduon kii jodi kaa sangyojan ho jaataa he or ardhasutrivibhaajanali ke samay ek ikai kii tarah kaam karata he
 Microtubules attached to chromosomes are called chromosomal microtubules
 anya sookshmanalikaayen vipakshi tarak kaay kii sookshmanalikaaon se antahkriya karti hai; inhen agunasutri sookshmanalikaayen yaa dhruviya sookshmanalikaayen kaha jaataa he
 a third type of microtubules, the asteroid microtubules, travels from the asteroid to the organism or contacts the membrane-skeletal parts
 samarupi jode metafez plate ke saath-saath chalate hai
 As the chromosomal microtubules emanating from both asterisks attach to their respective chromosomes, the homologous chromosomes are arranged by cutting the sphere in a Mediterranean plane due to the constant opposing forces exerted on the bivalents by the microtubules originating from both chromosomes
 Huh
 chromosomon ke swatantra vinyas kaa bhautik aadhaar samaan bumadhyarekha ke saath anya bivolenton ke prati prayek bivalent kaa metafez plate par betaratib anusthaapan he
 The microtubule microtubules shorten and separate from the recombination genes and separate homologous chromosomes
 chunki har chromosome main gunasutribinduon kii ek hi sakriy jodi hoti he, saare chromosome vipakshi dhruvon kii ore khinch jate hai, jisase do agunit set ban jate hai
 Each chromosome still contains a pair of sibling chromatids
 agunasutribindu sookshmanalikaayen lambii hokar tarak kaayon ko dur dhakelti hai
 The cell begins to elongate in preparation for division down the center
 antim ardhasutrivibhaajan prabhavakaari rup se chromosomon ke dhruvon par pahunchane ke saath samaapt ho jaataa he
 Now every daughter cell has half the number of chromosomes but every chromosome has a pair of chromatids
 tarku ke jaal ko banane vaali sookshmanalikaayen gaayab ho jaati hai or har agunit set ko ek nai kendrak jhilli ghere rahati he
 Chromosomes openly convert to chromatin again
 pashukoshikaon main koshika jhilli kaa hraas yaa vanaspati koshikaon main koshika-bhitti kaa nirmaan hota he, jise cytocinosis kehete hai or iske saath hi do putree koshikaon kii utpatti kaa kaary puraa ho jaataa he
 The sibling chromatids remain attached at the time of telophase 1
 koshikaayen vishram kii avasthaa yani interkinosis yaa interfez II main pravisht ho sakati hai
 DNA does not repeat at this stage
 ardhasutrivibhaajan II is prakriya kaa doosraa charan he
 Most of this process is similar to mitosis
 iske ant main ardhasutrivibhaajan i main utpann do agunit koshikaon se 4 agunit koshikaayen utpann hoti hai
 There are four main steps of meiosis II - prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II and telophase II
 profez II main upakendrak or kendrik aavaran dono antardhan ho jate hai or saath hi chromated chote or sthool ho jate hai
 The asteroids move towards the polar regions and arrange the fibers of the sphere for the second meiosis
 metafez II main, centromearon main do gunasutrabindu hote hai jo tarak kaayon ke tarku reshon se prayek dhruv par sanlagn ho jate hai
 The new terrestrial metaphase plate rotates at 90 ° from the previous plate compared to meiosis I
 iske baad anaafez II hota he, jisamen centromear vidalit ho jate hai, jisase gunsutri vinduon se judi sookshmanalikaayen sahodara chromatidon ko alag khinchne lagati hai
 The sister chromatids moving towards the opposing poles are now called sibling chromosomes
 yah prakriya tilofez II, jo tilofez i ke samaan hoti he, ke saath samaapt ho jaati he or isamen chromosome khulkar lambey ho jate hai tathaa tarku gaayab ho jaataa he
 The nucleus re-forms and divides or cell-wall formation eventually produces a total of four daughter cells, each containing a haploid set of chromosomes
 ardhasutrivibhaajan ab purna ho jaataa he or chaar nai putree koshikaayen utpann ho jaati hai
 Meiosis facilitates stable sexual reproduction
 guneet yaa chromosomon ko aadha kiye bina garbhaadhan hone par aise yugmaj utpann hote hai jinamein chromosomon kii sankhya pichhali peedi ke yugmajon se duguni hoti he
 In successive generations, the number of chromosomes will increase drastically
 Commonly occurring diploid organisms cause acute growth disorders due to multiplicity, ie the presence of three or more chromosome sets
 Multiplicity is not tolerated in most animal species
 But plants generally produce fertile, viable multiples
 vanaspati jatikaran main bahugunitha ko mahatvapurn prakriya mana gaya he
 The recombination and independent configuration of homologous chromosomes is due to greater diversity of genotypes in the public
 isse yugmakon main jeneey vividhta aati he, jisase santati main jeneey or phinotypic vividhta ko badhaava miltaa he
 The normal dissociation of chromosomes in meiosis 1 or the separation of sister chromatids in meiosis II is called dysfunction
 jab pruthakkikaran saamaanya nahin hota, to ise nondisjunkshan kehete hai
 This results in the formation of gametes that have a high or very low number of specific chromosomes and are the simple process of trisomy or monosomy
 nondisjunkshan ardhasutrivibhaajan i yaa ardhasutrivibhaajan II, koshikeey prajnan kii avasthaaon main, yaa sutrivibhaajan ke samay ho saktaa he
 It is the cause of many diseases occurring in humans: maadaa main dimbanuprasujan naamak koshikaon main ardhasutrivibhaajan hota he
 Each oocyte that initiates meiosis, splits twice to produce a single ovum and two polar bodies
 kintu, in vibhaajanon ke hone ke pehle, ye koshikaayen ardhasutrivibhaajan i kii diplotine dasha par thahar jaati hai or ek coop naamak daihik koshikaon ke rakshaatmak aavaran ke bheetar prasupt ho jaati hai
 These follicles begin to develop at a steady pace through a process called folliculogenesis, and some of them enter the menstrual cycle
 ritusravit dimbjan ardhasutrivibhaajan i jari rakhte hai or garbhaadhan hone tak ardhasutrivibhaajan II par tehre rahete hai
 In females, the process of meiosis occurs at the time of ovulation and differs from the typical meiosis because meiosis lasts for a long time in the dictate condition and is deprived of asterisks
 naron main, ardhasutrivibhaajan shukranujan naamak purvagami koshikaon main hota he, jo do baar vibhajit hokar shukranu main badal jaati hai
 These cells divide continuously without stopping in the seminiferous tubules of the testes
 veery ek sthir gati se utpann hota jaataa he
 The process of meiosis in males occurs during spermatogenesis
 maadaa stanpayiyon main ardhasutrivibhaajan bhrun main praathmik janan koshikaon ke andashay main pahanchane ke turant baad shuru ho jaataa he
 But meiosis in males begins at puberty after several years
 angadh gurde se praapt retinoik acid andashay ke dimbanuprasujan main ardhasutrivibhaajan ko uttejit karata he
 The tissues of the male testes prevent meiosis from occurring by neutralizing retinoic acid
 is par kaabo tab paaya jaataa he, jab yauvanarambh ke samay veeryajanak nalikaaon kii certoli koshikaayen swayan retinoik acid kaa utpaadan shuru kar detii hai
 Sensitivity to retinoic acid is also adjusted by proteins called nanos and DAZL
 ardhasutrivibhaajan shukranukoshikaon main hota he

 The preserved remains of ancient living organisms that were once alive on Earth or the impressions left by them in rocks, which are found safe in the earth's surfaces or layers of rocks, are called fossils
 jeevashm se carbonic vikaas kaa pratyaksh pramaan miltaa he
 Their study is called paleontology or paleontology
 vibhinn prakaar ke jeevashmon ke nirikshan se pataa chalata he ki prithvi par alag-alag kaalon main bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke jantu hue hai
 The oldest fossil deposits contain only the remains of the simplest organisms, but in innovative deposits the remains of progressively more complex organisms are found
 jyon-jyon ham pracheen se nutan kaalon kaa adhyayan karte hai, jeevashm jivit sajivon se bahut adhik milte-julate prathit hote hai
 Organisms with many intermediate traits suggest that organisms with simple structure have evolved from simple organisms
 adhikansh jeevashm abhilekhapurna nahin he parantu ghoda, oont, hathi, manushya aadi ke jeevashmon kii lagbhag puri shrinkhalaaon kaa pataa lagaaya ja chukaa he jisase carbonic vikaas ke thos pramaan praapt hote hai
 The fossil is called Fossil in English
 is shabd kii utpatti latin shabd "fossilas" se he, jiskaa arth "khodakar praapt kii gai vastu" hota he
 Common: The term fossil refers to the bio-remains of the geological ages of the past which are found in the sedimentary rocks of the earth's crust
 ye jeevashm yah batalaate hai ki ve jaev udgam ke hai tathaa apane main jaivik pramaan rakhte hai
 Two things are required to become fossils of animals and plants
 pehali aavashyak baat yah he ki unamem kankal, athwa kisi prakaar ke kathor ang, kaa hona ati aavashyak he, jo jeevashm ke rup main shailon main parirakshit rah saken
 The fossils cannot remain preserved in fossil condition due to the disintegration of organisms very quickly
 bhoumikeey yugon main prithvi par aise anek jeevon ke samudaay rahete the jinke sharir main koi kathor ang athwa kankal nahin tha at: fossil vigyaani aise jeevon ke samoohon ke adhyayan se vanchit rah jate hai, kyonki unka koi ang jeevashm swaroop parirakshit nahin paaya jaataa, jiskaa adhyayan kiya ja sake
 Therefore, the field of paleontology is limited to those classes of animals and plants that were eligible to become fossils
 duusari aavashyak baat yah he ki kankalon athwa kathor angon ko kshay or vighatan se bachane ke liye avsaadon se tunrat dhak janaa chahie
 The possibility of permanent grazing of the living organisms is very rare, as there are very few places at the site where depressions accumulate in large quantities continuously
 bahut hi kam paristhitiyon main thalwasi jeevon ke kathor bhaag baaloogiri ke baaluu main dabane se athwa bhuskhalan main dabane ke kaaran parirakshit paae gaye hon
 The possibility of aquatic fauna is highly favorable because water is much more than the sedimentation site itself
 in jaleey avsaadon main bhi, aise jaleey avsaadon main jinka nirmaan samudr ke garbh main hota he, bahut badi sankhya main jeev avshesh paae jate hai, kyonki samudr hi aisa sthal he jahaan par avsaadan sabase adhik maatra main satat hota rahata he
 There is a great difference in the shape and composition of the different classes of organisms and the hard parts of plants
 kiton tathaa hydra virgon main kathor bhaag aise padaarth ke hote hai jise kytin kehete hai, anek spanj or diatem baaluu ke bane hote hai, kasheruki kii asthiyon main mukhyat: calcium carbonate or phosphate hote hai, pravaalon, ekinodermata, molska or anek anya praaniyon main tathaa kuch padpon main calcium carbonate hota he or anya padpon main adhikanshat: kashtha utak hote hai
 Among all these substances, chitin can be dissolved with great difficulty
 baaluu, jab use praani utsarjint karte hai, tab bada sheeghra ghul jaataa he
 This is why the skeletons made of sand dissolve very quickly
 calciumi kankalon main chooney kaa carbonate aise jal main, jisamen carbonic amla hota he, ati sheeghra ghul jaataa he, parantu vileyata kii maatra chooney ke carbonate kii maatra ke anusaar bhinn bhinn hoti he
 Powdery skeletons are made of calcite or aragonite
 inamen se kailcite ke kavach eregonite ke kavchon kii apeksha adhik drudh or tikaoo hote hai
 The armor of most creatures is made of calcite or aragonite
 avsaadee shailon main parirakshit jeevashm nimna prakaar ke hote hai : Whole Shielded Animals - It is rare for fossils of a creature to be obtained without any disruption, but examples of such preserved fossils are fossils of mammoths and rhinoceroses, which have been found frozen in the tundra ice
 praaia: aparivartit dasha main parirakshit paae janevaale kankal - kabhi-kabhi jab shailon main keval kankal hi parirakshit paaya jaataa he tab yah dekha gaya he ki vah apni pehle jaisi, tab kii avasthaa main he jab vah samadhisth hua tha
 The only change is that in the fossil state, organic matter is lost from the skeleton
 carbonikaran - kuch padpon or kuch praaniyon main, jaise graptolite, jinamein kankal kytin kaa bana hota he, mul dravya carbonikrut ho jaataa he
 The organism undergoes decomposition, as a result of which oxygen and nitrogen are lost and carbon remains
 kankalon kaa saanchaa - kabhi-kabhi kankal yaa kavach villin ho jate hai or unke sthaan par unka keval saanchaa rah jaataa he
 This is such that after the armor is covered with depression, the inner part of the shell is also filled with depressant
 iske uparaant carbonic amla mishrit jal, shail main risataa hua us sthaan tak pahunch jaataa he jahaan par kavach gada hua rahata he or use calcium ke bikabonate ke rup main purnat: villin kar detaa he
 As a result, only one mold of the internal and external shape of the armor is seen in place of the armor
 in donon ke bich ke sthaan main mulat: kavach tha or yadi yah sthaan mom se bhar diya jaae to kavach kaa yatharth saanchaa mil jaataa he
 Ashmibhavan - Sometimes in fossils, those organisms that have become fossilized are seen up to microscopic size
 antar keval itnaa hota he ki kankalon kaa mul dravya kisi khanij dwaara pratisthapit ho jaataa he
 This action is called Ashmibhavan
 ashmibhavan kaa ati uttam udhaaharan ashmibhoot kashtha hai jo dekhne main bilkul vaise hi dikhalaai padate hai jaisaa jivit padpon kaa kashtha hota he
 This change happens in such a way that when a particle of adikastha is removed, then a particle of sand or any other mineral comes in its place, due to which the original shape of the wood remains intact
 is vidhi se mul dravya ko hataanevaale mukhya khanij ye hai : calcium kaa carbonate, baaluu, lohmakshik, loh oxide or kabhi kabhi calcium kaa sulphate aadi
 Symbols - Sometimes the footprints of fauna, holes, holes etc
 are found in rocks
 yadhyapi ye jeevajantuon ke kathor angon ke koi bhaag nahin hai or isliye inako fossil nahin kaha ja saktaa, phir bhi ye utane hi mahatv ke samajhe jate hai jitne fossil
 Following are the uses of fossils: shailon ke sahasambandh main jeevashmon kaa upyog - ve jeev jo aaj hamen jeevashm ke rup main milte hai, kisi bhaumkeey yug ke kisi nishchit kaal main avashya hi rahe honge
 Therefore, they are of great importance to us
 wiliam smith or kuvye mahoday ke, jo starit bhoumiki ke janmdata hai, samay se hi yah baat bhalee bhanti vidit he ki avsaadee shailon main paae janevaale jeevashmon or unke bhoumikeey stambh ke sthaan main ek nishchit sambandh he
 It has been well known that the smaller the rocks are, the more different the variety and phytosanitary organisms obtained in them, and the longer they are, the simpler and simpler they will be
 at: shailon kaa stareey sthaan nishchay karne main jeevashmon kaa pramukh sthaan he or ve bade mahatv ke siddh hue hai
 Fossils are not found in the ancient rocks of the Cambrian East
 at: jeevashmon ke abhaav main jeevashmon kii sahaayta se in shailon kaa sahasambandh nahin sthapit kiya jaataa he
 Animals and plants from all parts of the geological column from the Cambrian to the present day have been traced
 at: prithvi ke kisi bhi bhaag main in bhaagon ke sam bhaagon kaa pataa lagaana ab apekshaya saral he
 Fossils suggestive of geography of ancient times - Under geography, the sites of ancient times and the expansion of the sea, the borders, lakes, plains, mountains etc
 of that period are included
 kisi vishesh vaataavaran ke anusaar hi jeev apane ko sthit ke anukool kar lete hai, yah baat jitani sachhee adhanik samay main he utani hi sachhee ateet ke bhoumikeey yugon main bhi thi
 Therefore, with the help of fossils, we can find out at which place there were deltas, mountains, rivers, beaches, shallow or deep seas, because the creatures living in the site, the aquatic creatures and the living creatures in the water, the fresh water organisms, the salt water Are completely different from living beings
 jeevashm purajalvaayu ke suchak - jeevashmon kii sahaayta se bhoumikeey yugon kii jalwaayu ke vishay main bhi kisi seemaa tak anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In this direction, the evidence provided by site plants is of particular importance, as they are mostly extensional to the temperature of the marine organisms and they can be easily separated into different parts according to the climate
 samudri jeevon main kuch kaa vistaran jalwaayu kii dashaon ke anusaar hota he, jaise pravaal, jo garam jalwaayu main rahete hai
 Indicators of fossil biology - Fossils have thrown much light on the theory of biology and it is impossible to trace biology without the help of fossils
 jeevashmon kaa sangrah jeevashmiya tathaa starit shail vigyaan donon kii drushti se kiya jaataa he
 The following points should always be kept in mind while collecting fossils: yadi bhoumikeey rachana kaa alpajivashmiya ho to sab jeevashmon kaa sangrah karnaa chahie, chaahe ve purna hon athwa khandamay
 If fossils are not impossible to remove, then complete fossils should never be discarded
 unhen sugamawa se nikaal lenaa chahie
 Such fragmentary fossils, which have elaborate morphological characteristics, are of more importance than many complete fossils, which lack morphological features
 kabhi bhi kshetra main jeevashmon ko pahchaanane kaa praytn na karnaa chahie
 If the collection of fossils is done from the point of view of layered-rockology, then it is necessary to collect fossils from each composition separately
 yah nishchay karnaa bada mahatvapurn he ki jeevashm kis str se sangrahit kiye gaye hai, kyonki bina yah maaloom kiye jeevashmon kaa sangrah praaia: arthhin sa ho jaataa he
 It can be decided with ease at the time of fossilization
 jeevashmon ke sangrah ke saath saath styleey rachanaaon ke mukhya mukhya or vishisht lakshanon ko bhi likh lenaa chahie
 a light hammer, chisel, small bags and scrap paper are very useful to the paleontologist in the fossil
 yadi bade-bade jeevashmon kii khoj ho, to sabase pehle ritukshrit staron kii ore dhyaan dena chahie
 If fossils do not appear here, there is a possibility of being found in a recently dissolved base
 yadi koi jeevashm kathor shail main laga hua dikhaai pade, to ekaek nikaalane kaa prayaas na karnaa chahie balki uske aasapaas ke sthaan main daraaron kaa pataa laga lenaa chahie
 From these cracks, parts of the rock that contain fossils are easily broken
 is prakaar se jeevashmon ke nikaalte samay is baat kaa sadaiv dhyaan rakhana chaahe ki shail par hathaudaa, jeevashm se jitani dur sambhav ho, chalaanaa chahie
 Doing so reduces the possibility of fossil breakdown and separates the fossil including the shell
 yadi foraminiphera jaise chote jeevashmon kaa sangrah karnaa he, to inkaa ek ek karke sangrah karnaa spashtat: asambhav sa he
 In this case it would be appropriate to collect bound shales, or rock samples only
 is prakaar se laai gai saamagree baad main prayogshaala main sankalan kii jaati he or usko ek hast lens se dekhne par usamen anek laghu jeevashm dikhaai padate hai, jinako chalaniyon kii sahaayta se aadhaar se alag kar sakate hai
 After the collection of fossils in the field, a label should be attached to each fossil, which requires two things to be mentioned: the exact level from which the fossil has been taken and the name of the place from which the fossil is collected
 aisa karne ke uparaant jeevashm ko raddi kaagaj main lapetakar or dore se baandhakar prayogshaala main laana chahie
 The method of extracting fossils from the rock base is a type of art
 is vashay main koi pakke niyam nahin batalaaye ja sakate, kyonki bhinn bhinn prakaar kii samasyaayen saamne aati hai
 By which method and how the fossil can be separated from the stone, an experienced paleontologist understands it by looking at the fossil
 jin shail aadhaaron main jeevashm khachit rahete hai ve mridu mrudaa se lekar saghan shail tak hote hai, jinaki kathorta ispaat ke baraabar ho sakati he
 There is not much difference in the extent of hardness of fossils
 jeevashm nikaalte samay jeevashm vigyaani kaa yah dhyey hota he ki jeevashm ko bina kisi prakaar kshati pahunchaae shail se pruthak kar de
 If the base is milder than the fossil, it can be easily removed with the help of a brush
 yadi jeevashm abaddh chuunaapatthar main khachit paae jate hai, to use bhi ham daant saaf karanevaale brush kii sahaayta se alag kar sakate hai
 If the shell base is chalk in nature, it can be separated with the help of confused brushes in the dental apparatus
 anya avasaron par jab jeevashm bhangur ho or badi dridhtaa ke saath shail ke aadhaar main jude hon tab hathode maar markar jeevashmon kaa alag karnaa kathin hota he
 In such a situation, by heating the stone several times and putting it immediately in water, the separation of fossils from the stone becomes easy
 baaluu or anya chooneydaar shailon sa foraminiphera jaise jeevashmon ke nikaalane main, shail ko pehle tod lete hai or phir usko kai prakaar kii chalaniyon main chaan lete hai
 In this, fossils are separated from the rock part
 jab shail kathor hote hai tab doosraa dhang upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 They break the shell into small pieces and then heat them so much that they dry completely and then put them in cold water in this hot state
 is prakaar se kathor mrudaa keech main apavighatit ho jaati he or phir ant main jeevashmon ko prastar bhaag se dho karke alag kar lete hai
 When the separation of fossils by mechanical methods is not possible, then chemical methods are used
 inamen sabase saralatam rituksharan kii vidhi he, jo bahut si dashaon main bina jeevashmon ko kisi prakaar haani pahunchaae hue shail aadhaar ko apghatt kar detaa he
 This action is accelerated by using very dilute acid
 yahan yah batala dena thik hoga ki amla kaa prayog badi saavdhaanee ke saath karnaa chahie, kyonki adhikansh jeevashmon ke panjar chooneydaar hote hai or unpar amla kaa prabhaav turant hota he
 Generally, caustic potash is the right type of reactant, which can be used without any fear
 iske chote chote kanon ko sukhi avasthaa main us saare shail aadhaar par daal dete hai jise hataanaa hota he
 Since the caustic potash is precipitated in nature
 at: yah aadhaar ke andar pravisht kar jaataa he or usko apaghatit kar detaa he
 It does not harm echinoderma, or molluscs
 brackeopoda main iskaa upyog nahin karnaa chahie, kyonki yah inke paratdaar panjaron main sugamawapurvak pravisht kar jaataa he, jiske kaaran inaki paraten alag ho jaati hai
 Finally, fossils should be washed thoroughly with water
 shell jais shailon main parirakshit graptolite or padap jeevashm kaa pruthakkaran "sthanantaran vidhi" se kiya jaataa he
 Following are the main highlights of this separation: namoonay k vah tal, jisamen jeevashm he, neeche karke canada baalsam kii sahaayta se kaach kii slide main chipka dete hai
 The portion of the shell that can be cut or worn easily can be cut or worn
 shell tal ko bhigo lete hai or phir usko pighale hue mom main dubaa dete hai
 The wax separates easily from the humid floor and does not allow any chemical action on the slab
 shell yukt sampurna jeevashm ko hydrophloric amla ke amlatapak main rakh dete hai
 It throttles the shell without damaging the fossil at all
 dhone ke uparaant padap athwa graptolite jeevashm ko cover glass se dhank dena chahie
 Like the fossils of modern fossils like graptolite and some plants extracted in this way, the passages can be made with the help of microscopes
 kathor jeevashmon ke bhi pariched ghis karke banaae ja sakate hai
 Photographs have to be taken at regular periods while grinding
 is vidhi main sabase bada dosha yah he ki jis jeevashm kaa pareekshan is vidhi se kiya jaataa he vah nasht ho jaataa he
 In addition to the above mentioned methods of separation of fossils, there are some special methods for tracing the brachial part of Brachiopoda
 in vidhiyon se trilobites, amonites or ekinodermiz main sivanarekha kaa anurekhan bhi ati mahatv kaa kaary he
 It can be distinguished by the support of any type of storage
 bhartiya masi is kaary ke liye uttam he
 Karikkal Ammai was a Tamil saint writer
 karikkaal chol tamilnadadd ke samudri vyapaarik shahar he
 Sodagar named Dhanathanathanar was born
 bachapan se ammai bagwaan kii kathin bhakt thi
 Karikkal Ammai made Shivling sand in childhood
 ammai ne paanch patr mantra namasivaay bole or bhaag liya shiv bhakton ki zaruraton ke liye
 Shiva cares for her like a mother at a very young age
 ammai nagpton ki ek dhani vyapaaree ke bete ke sat shaadi hua tha
 Shiva devotees who did the dora of his home were comfortably fed up
 ek din ammai ke pati parmanthaan do aam uske liye lakha janaa karne keliye kaha tha
 a hungry Shiva devotee came to Ammai that day
 or khaanaa kaa lunch tayar nahi tha
 Ammai also gave dahi rice and a mango
 jab unke pathi aaye samay wo aam puchha or wo pareshaan lag gaya
 He saw Aya and two mangoes in the Bapus room
 tab wo aashcharya hogaya or bhagwaan shiv ko prashansa kiya
 Her husband was not a devotee of Lord Shiva
 or unone pehele vishvas nahin kiya he ki ye aam bhagwaan se aye the
 And the husband still asked for the mangoes
 or phir bhi wo puchha or phir bhi bhagwaan ne aam diya
 At this time Ammai's husband was convinced
 or wo bhi bhagwaan shiv kii kathin bhakt ban gaya
 Ammai Mount traveled to Koulash, and upside down lay down on his head
 vahaan devi parvati shiv kii patni ammaiyar ke bare mein poocha

 wiliam 3 janm se hi orange ke samprabhu rajkumaar the, isi ke kaaran ve "wiliam ouf orange" ke naam se prasiddh he
 From 1672, Holland, Zeeland, Amsterdam, Gelderland and Overijssel were the rulers of the Dutch Republic
 yah ek sanyog he ki sankhya donon orange or england ke liye hi kiya gaya he
 He said that informally "king Billy" is known by population segments in Northern Ireland and Scotland
 unka janm 4 november 1650 ko binnehof, da hegg main hua tha
 His rule took place from 4 July 1672 to 8 March 1702
 unki praathmik shiksha dach dai maan ke haathon main thi
 Beginning in 1659, William went on to formal education for seven years, under the guidance of ethics professor "hendrik Borneus", at Leiden University
 dach adhikariyon ko in shadyantron ko andekha karne ke liye pehali baar main apana sarvshereshth kiya tha
 On 23 December 1660, when William was ten years old, his mother pox at Whitehall Palace, London
 unki maa kii mrityu ke baad wiliam kii shiksha or sangrakshan ke apane vansh ke samarthakon or ek adhik republican netherland ke adhivaktaaon ke bich vivaad kaa ek mudda ban gaya he
 During the war with France, William tried in 1677 to improve her situation by marrying, her cousin Mary, the elder surviving daughter of James, Duke of York, James II of England later
 mairi gyaarah saal se unase junior thi or vah amsterdam vyapaariyon jo apni mon ko naapsand the
 Resistance to a Stuart match was anticipated, but William believed that marrying Mary Charles would increase his chances of succeeding to the kingdoms, and the Emperor of England would draw away from his pro-french policies
 1702 main, wiliam nimonia kii ek jatilta ke ek tuuti hui hansli se apane ghode, ek prakaar kii vanaspati se girane ke baad nidhan ho gayi
 Years later, Sir Winston Churchill, a history of his English-speaking people, states that the fall "opened the door to a troop of enemy secret

 Each such point p will be the focal point of two-dimensional rotation induced by r in B
 is tarah ke sabhi dwivimiya ghurnan samaan ghurnan kone α { \ displaystyle \ alpha } se hote hai
 Rays from o are not displaced in axial plane A; The rays from the Lambic o of a are displaced by the α { \ displaystyle \ alpha} angle; All other rays are displaced by an angle less than α { \ displaystyle \ alpha}

 According to this legislation, three councils were appointed

 sabase pehle spain ne is vyavastha ke viruddh vidroh kiya
 As a result, Napoleon invaded Spain and seized power there
 is par spain main ek rashtriya vidroh chhid gaya
 Napoleon could not suppress it, he had to suppress the rebellion of Austria, and then Prussa and Russia also disobeyed this system
 rus kaa vidroh nepolian ke liye vinaashkari siddh hua
 The ruin of his Moscow campaign has become famous in history
 paris lautakar nepolian ne pun: ek sena ekatra kii kintu lipatsig main use phir prasha, rus or austria kii sanmilit senaaon ne haraaya
 Due to the national struggle erupting all around, he could not actively suppress any nation and in 1814 AD was sent to the island of Elba
 mitra rashtron kii senaayen waapas bhi nahin ho paayin thim ki soochna mili ki nepolian kaa shatdivasiy shashan shuru hua
 The Allies therefore defeated him in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and imprisoned St
 Helena

 Napoleon Bonaparte took reforms in various areas in 1799 to consolidate his position in power and provide administrative stability to France
 vastutah diarectory ke shashan ko samaapt kar nepalian ne satta kii thi or france kii janata ne us parivartan ko sweekaar kiya tha to iskaa kaaran tha vah araajaktaa or avyavashtha se ub chuki thi
 Therefore, it was necessary for Napoleon to establish a well-organized governance and law and order in the interior
 pratham counsal banane ke baad nepolian ne france ke liye ek naveen samvidhan kaa nirmaan kiya jo kranti yug kaa chauthaa samvidhan tha
 Through this, executive power was vested in three counselors
 pradhan counsal ko anya counsalaron se adhik shakti praapt thi
 In fact, the Republic certainly showed in the Constitution, but the entire power of the state was concentrated in the hands of Nepalis
 nepolian ne shashan vyavastha kaa kenndrikaran kiya or departments tathaa district kii sthaneey sarkaron ko samaapt kar prefect evam sab-prefects kii niyukti kii
 Their appointment and the appointment of all the mayors of villages and cities were directly done by the central government
 is prakaar prashasan ke kshetra nepolian ne in adhikariyon par paryaapt niyantran rakh prashasan ko chust-durust banaae rakhaa saath hi yogyata ke aadhaar par inaki niyukti kii
 Napoleon's reforms in administrative areas were in a way anti-revolution because the National Assembly had completely decentralized the administrative structure during the revolution and elected representatives were given the responsibility to govern the country, but the Nepalese gave this arrangement Reversed and reestablished pre-revolution system
 us drushti se vah kranti kaa hantaa tha
 Napoleon tried to revive France from its dismal economic situation
 is kram main usne sarvapratham kar pranali ko sucharu banaaya
 The task of collecting tax was done by the central employees and the recovery started strictly

 He emphasized austerity and imposed many indirect taxes on the French people
 nepolian ne france main vittiya gatividhiyon ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye bank of france kii sthapana kii jo aaj bhi kaayam he
 It also set up a separate fund to repay the national debt
 nepolian ne jahaan tak sambhav hua sena ke kharch kaa boj vijit pradeshon par daalaa or france kii janata ko is boj se mukt rakhane kii koshish kii
 Napoleon also stressed the improvement of agriculture and planned to make the barren and sandy areas fertile

 Arranged for mechanical education for the progress of various types of businesses, roads, canals built
 francisi audyogic vastuon ko lokapriy banane ke liye pradarshnee ke aayojan ko badhaava diya or swadeshi vastuon evam udyogon ko protsaahan diya
 Encouraged construction work to overcome the problem of unemployment
 is tarah nepolian ne france ko jarjar or diwaaliyepan kii sthit se ubaara
 But even in terms of economic reforms, Napoleon's actions appear to be anti-revolution
 krantikaal main pratyaksh karo par bal diya gaya tha jabaki nepolian ne apratyaksh karon par bal dekar puraatan vyavastha ko sthapit karne kii koshish kii
 In the same way, Napoleon displayed an anti-revolutionary mindset by prioritizing the commercialist philosophy
 uskaa maananaa tha ki rajya ko kosh kii suraksha evam vyapaar main santulan laane ke liye sakriy hastkshep karnaa hoga jabaki kranti kaa bal to mukt vyapaar par tha
 The Nepalese wanted citizens who had faith in him and his system
 iske liye usne shiksha ke rashtriya evam dharmanirpeksh swaroop apanaate hue sudhaar kiye
 Organized education at primary, secondary and higher levels
 sarkaar ke dwaara niyukt shikshakon kii sahaayta se chalane vaale in skulon main ek hi paathyakram, ek hi pathyapustaken ek hi vardi rakhi jaati thi
 Napoleon established a university in Paris and taught subjects in Latin, French, science, mathematics, etc
 yah uniwarsity vishvavidhyalay ke saamaanya arth main koi uniwarsity nahin thi varan praathmik se ucchtar shiksha tak kii sabhi sansthaaon ko ekasutra main baandhne vaali ek vyavastha kii
 Its aim was to keep maximum government control over education and to make students loyal to the government
 nepolian ne shodh kaaryon ke liye insticute of france kii sthapana kii
 Napoleon showed no interest in women's education
 unki shiksha kaa bhaar dharmik sansthaaon par chhod diya gaya
 The majority of France's population was under the influence of the Catholic Church
 kranti ke dauraan carch kii shakti ko kamjor kar use rajya ke adheen le aayaa gaya
 Church property was nationalized and clergy were asked to take an oath of loyalty to the state
 isse pope naaraaz hua or aam janata ko virodh karne ke liye uksaaya
 As a result, there was tension between the government and the public
 nepolian ne ise dur karne ke liye 1801 se pope ke saath samjhauta kiya jise konkardet kaha jaataa he
 He had the following provisions
 nepolian kaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn or sthaayee kaary tha- vidhi samhita kaa nirmaan
 In fact, before the revolution, the law and order of France was different and there were so many types of laws that even those who followed the law did not know them and this chaos increased even during the revolution
 nepolian ne is avyavashtha ko dur kiya
 Napoleon himself considered his Code of Law more powerful than his 40 wars
 is code ke dwaara nepolian ne france main sarvlokik kanoon paddati kii sthapana kii
 Under the Civil Code, he strengthened the authority of the head of the family
 striyaan purushon ke adheen rakhi gai or pati kaa kaary patni kii raksha karnaa he
 The divorce method was made difficult
 civil vivaah kii vyavastha bhi is samhita main kii gai
 Thus, by recognizing the practice of civil marriage and divorce, Napoleon practiced in Europe that the work of society could go on without the cooperation of the priests
 is prakaar anya samhitaayein jaise vyapaar sambandhi kanoon samhita, Code of Criminal Proc
 aadi banaae gaye
 The interests of the laborers were ignored in its trading code and the ban on their unions continued
 is drushti se nepolian ne kranti ke aadarshon ke viruddh kaary kiya
 Despite this, the importance of this law code was to provide uniformity of law throughout the country and to simplify the judicial system practically
 jahaan-jahaan nepolian kii senaayen gai yah samhita lagu kii gai or nepolian ke paraajay ke baad bhi barkaraar rahi
 It is a permanent fame of Napoleon
 nepolian ke vidhi samhita main burjua varg ke hiton par zyada jor diya gaya he
 The officer related to land was further strengthened and the protection of personal property was further strengthened and a number of laws were enacted to protect personal property
 tered union bananaa aparaadh ghoshit kiya gaya
 In case of litigation, the owners were asked to accept the claims of the owners in lieu of the arguments of the workers
 naagarik samhita kaa aadhaar saamaajik samta bhi he
 Privilege and feudal rule had no place in the Code
 bade putr ko sampatti kaa uttaradhikari maanane kaa kanoon bhi nahin tha sampatti par sabhi putron ko barabari kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 Napoleon established a new elite in society
 usne aay ke hisaab se oopaadhiyon kaa kram nirdhaarit kiya
 This work of Napoleon was contrary to the ideals of revolution
 europe raajnneetik kshitij par nepolian kaa pradurbhaav ek ghumaketu kii tarah hua or apni prakriya tathaa parishram ke bal par vah sheeghra hi europe kaa bhaagyavidhaataa ban baitha
 In it, everyone was amazed by his amazing military and administrative abilities
 parantu uski shakti kaa stambh jaise baalu kii bhit par khadaa tha
 What collapsed within a few years was virtually the rise and fall of Napoleon like a dazzling meteor
 vah europe ke akaash main sainik safalataa ke bal par chamakta rahaa parantu paraajay ke saath hi uske bhagya kaa sitara dub gaya
 The empire, which was established after hard work, came to an end on seeing that there were many reasons for its downfall, which are the same
 aseem mahatvakanksha- Napoleon was infinitely ambitious
 aseem mahatvakankshi kisi vyakti ke patan kaa mukhya kaaran sabit hoti he
 The same thing happened with Napoleon
 yuddh main jaise- jaise- uski vijay hoti gai vaise- vaise uski mahatvakanksha badhaata gaya or vah vishwa rajya kii sthapana kaa swapan dekhne laga
 He would not have to see the plight of the downfall if he was satisfied with a little and took care of the conquered empire and spent his time in it
 charitrik durbalata- Napoleon was full of courage, restraint and patience, but in his eyes, hatred was his vengeance and his stigma of forgiveness
 uske charitra kii badi durbalata yah thi ki vah sandhi ko sammanit samjhauta nahin maanata tha
 Friendship of any country was no more than a political necessity for him
 dhire- dhire vah ziddee banataa gaya use yah vishwaas tha ki uskaa prayek kadam thik he
 He could never forget, he began to ignore the advice of others
 falat: uske sachche mitra bhi usase dur hote chale gaye
 Napoleon's system was based on militarism- uski raajnneetik pranali sanyavad par aadhaarit thi jo iske patan kaa pradhan kaaran sabit hua
 He depended on the army in all matters, as a result he was always involved in war
 vah yah bhul gaya ki sainikwaad sirf sankat ke samay hi laabhakaari ho saktaa he
 As long as France was clouded by plagues, the people there supported him
 As soon as the plagues were removed, the people stopped supporting him
 francisi janata kii sahanubhuti or prem kaa khona uske liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Apart from this, the defeated nations became his enemies, who rose up against him as soon as the opportunity arose
 itihaaskaar kabbon ne thik hi likhaa he
 'napoleon's empire flourished in war The war was the basis of his existence and it ended in war itself
 ’ Defective military system prarambh main france kii sena desh prem kii bhaavana se otprot thi
 He used to fight for an ideal and to serve a purpose
 parantu jyon- jyon uske samrajya kaa vistaar hua sena kaa rashtriya rup vidhitat hota gaya
 At first, French troops were included in his army but later German German Purtagali and Dutch soldiers were added to it
 falat: uski sena anek rajyon kii sena ban gai
 There was no ideal and purpose before him
 at: uski sainik shakti kamjor padati gai or yah uske patan kaa mahatvapurn kaaran sabit hua
 Weakness of the Navy nepolian ne sthal sena kaa sanghathan thik se kiya tha kintu uske paas shaktishali nausena kaa abhaav tha, jiske kaaran use england se parajeet hona padaa
 If he had a powerful navy he would not have to be defeated by England
 vijit pradeshon main deshbhakti kaa abhaav- The territories he conquered were not in the hearts of the people, but he had goodwill and love for them
 ve nepolian kii shashan se ghrinaa karte the
 When his power began to weaken, his subordinate states began to strive for their independence
 europea raashtra ne uske khilaaf sangh ke liye chaturth gut kaa nirmaan kiya or isi ke chalate waterlu ke yuddh main use parajeet hona padaa
 Enmity with the pope mahadwipiya vyavastha ke kaaran usne pope ko apana shatru bana liya
 When the Pope refused to accept the same continental system, he took over Rome in April 1808
 or 1809 i
 main pope ko bandi bana liya falat: catholicon ko yah vishwaas ho gaya ki nepolian ne keval rajyon kii swatantraaa nasht karne vaala daanav he
 Otherwise, they also destroy their religion
 audyogic kranti- It is said that he was defeated not in the grounds of Waterloo but in the factories of Manchester and the iron cladding of Barkingdhan
 audyogic kranti ke falswarup england main bade -2 kaarkaane khole gaye or dekhte hi dekhte england samrudh ban gaya
 As a result, he was able to meet his army's modern assassin, which proved fatal to Napoleon
 mahadwipiya vyavastha- The continental system was quite forgotten
 vah england ko sabase bada shatru maanata tha
 England's mainstay of power was naval and worldwide trade and Napoleon could not destroy his naval power, so his trade was tried to strike
 isi uddeshy se usne mahadwipiya vyavastha ko janm diya usne aadesh jari kiya ki koi desh england ke saath vyapaar nahin kar saktaa he
 And neither can use England made
 yah nepolian kii bhayankar bhul thi
 This arrangement trapped him in a trap that was difficult to get out of
 isliye mahadwipiya vyavastha iske patan kaa mukhya kaaran mana jaataa he
 War with the Portuguese purtegal kaa england ke saath vyapaarik sambandh tha kintu nepolian ke dawaab ke kaaran use england se sambandh todna padaa
 This caused considerable damage to Purtigal
 isliye usne phir se england ke saath vyapaarik sambandh kaayam kiya
 Napoleon was enraged and attacked Purtagal
 yah bhi nepolian ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Conflict with Spain nepolian kii teesri bhul spain ke aantarik maamle main hastkshep tha
 Millions of its soldiers were killed
 falat: is yuddh main uski sthiti bilkul kamjor ho gai
 Which encouraged his opponents, when Napoleon made his brother king of Spain, the inhabitants there were not ready to consider that foreigner as king
 unhone nepolian kii sena ko spain se bhaga diya
 Other countries were also encouraged by that rebellion and they also started revolting, which made its fall inevitable
 rus kaa abhiyaan- Napoleon heavily invaded Russia and Russia did not accept its continental system
 isapar nepolian ne rus par akraman kar diya
 In this, however, Moscow was captured but it had to suffer great damage
 uske virodhiyon ne akraman karne kii yojana banaai
 He had to be defeated in this attack
 thakaan- He was tired of being constantly busy in many wars
 50 tourists have written that all the reason for the fall of Napoleon lies in the same word fatigue
 jyon- jyon vah yudadh main ulajhata gaya tyon- 2 uski shakti kamjor padati gai vah thak gaya or uske chalate bhi uskaa patan jaruri ho gaya
 Relative uske patan ke liye uske sage sambadhi bhi kam uttaradaayi nahin the
 However, he used to behave generously towards his relatives
 lekin jab bhi vah sankat main padataa tha to uske sambandhi uski madad nahin karte the
 Organization of quartz nepolian kii kamajori se laabh uthaakar uske shatruon ne chaturth gut kaa nirmaan kiya or mitra rashtron ne use parajeet kiya
 He was captured and sent to Salbai and was made independent ruler there but Napoleon could not stay there for a long time
 He soon returned to France and became the ruler there
 lekin isbaar vah sirf sau dinon tak ke liye samraat rahe
 The Allies were finally defeated in the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815 AD
 vah pakad liya gaya mitra rashtron ne use kaidi ke rup main saint helena naamak tapu par bhej diya jahaan 52 varshon kii aayu main 1821 i
 main uski mrityu ho gai
 Thus, all the above reasons were directly and indirectly responsible for his downfall
 He built his empire through war and it also fell due to the wars
 arthath jin tatwon ne nepolian ke samrajya kaa nirmaan kiya tha unheen tatwon ne uskaa vinaash bhi kar diya
 Bhagwanpur Talla is a village in Nainital district of Kumaon division under the Uttarakhand state of India in Haldwani tehsil
 kaththa vaidic kaal kii hindu lambaai maapan kii ikai he
 It is not a unit of length, but of area

 One plan equals four cos
 yani 13-16 ki
me
100 yojan se ek mahaayojan banataa he
 Four times = one plan ek bigha baraabar he: Abraham Lincoln was the sixteenth President of the United States
 inkaa kaarykaal 1861 se 1865 tak tha
 He was from the Republican Party
 unhone america ko uske sabase bade sankat - grihayuddh se paar lagaaya
 Lincoln owes the end of slavery in America
 abraham linkan kaa janm ek garib ashwet parivaar main hua tha
 He was the first Republican to become the President of the United States
 uske pehle ve ek vakil, ilians state ke vidhayak, america ke house off represntatius ke sadsy the
 He also failed in the Senate elections twice
 vakaalat se kamai kii drushti se dekhen to america ke raashtrapati banane se pehle abraham linkan ne bees saal tak vakaalat kii
 But the satisfaction and mental peace he and his clients got from their advocacy is next to nothing but wealth
 unke vakaalat ke dinon ke sainkadon sachche kisse unki eemaandaaree or sajjanta kii gavaahi dete hai
 Lincoln did not charge more than his clients who were 'poor like him'
 ek baar unke ek muvakkil ne unhen pachchis dollar bheje to linkan ne usamen se das dollar yah kahkar lautaa die ki pandrah dollar paryaapt the
 Usually, they used to advise their clients to settle the matter by persuading them outside the court so that the money of both the parties would not be wasted in litigation, in exchange for which they got equal fees
 ek shahid sainik kii vidhwaa ko uski pension ke 400 dollar dilaane ke liye ek pension agent 200 dollar fees main maang rahaa tha
 Lincoln not only pleaded for the woman for free, but also arranged for the cost of staying at her hotel and a return ticket
 linkan or unke ek sahyogi vakil ne ek baar kisi maansik rogi mahila kii jameen par kabja karne vaale ek dhoort aadmi ko adaalat se sajaa dilwaai
 maamla adaalat main keval pandrah minute hi chalaa
 sahyogi vakil ne jeetne ke baad fees main bantwarakan ne use dapat diya
 Aide lawyer said the woman's brother had paid the full fees and everyone was pleased with the court's decision, but Lincoln said - "but I'm not happy!" That money belongs to a poor woman and i would rather die of starvation than take such money
 You refund my fee to him
 " aaj ke hisaab se sochen to linkan bevakoof the
 He never had anything in abundance and it was his fault
 lekin vah ham sabamein sabase achche manushya the, kya koi is baat se inkaar kar saktaa he? Lincoln never discussed religion and was not associated with any church
 ek baar unke kisi mitra ne unase unke dharmik vichaar ke bare main poocha
 linkan ne kaha – “bahut pehle main indiana main ek buudhe aadmi se mila jo yah kahata tha ‘jab main kuch acha karata hoon to acha anubhav karata hoon or jab bura karata hoon to bura anubhav karata hoon’
 yahi meraa dharm he’
 Abraham Lincoln wrote this letter to his son's school principal
 linkan ne isamen ve tamaam baaten likhi thim jo ve apane bete ko sikhaanaa chaahate the
 Honorable Sir, i know that not all people in this world are good and true
 yah baat mere bete ko bhi siikhnaa hogi
 But i want you to tell him that every bad person also has a good heart
 har swaarthee netaa ke andar acha leader banane kii kshamta hoti he
 i want you to teach him that every enemy also has the possibility of becoming a friend
 ye baaten seekhney main use samay lagegaa, main jaanata hoon
 But you should teach him that one rupee earned by hard work is more valuable than a five rupee note found on the road
 aap use bataaiega ki dusron se jalan kii bhaavana apane man main naa laaen
 Also, how important it is to maintain decency even while laughing openly
 mujhe ummid he ki aap use bataa paayenge ki dusron ko dhamkaana or daraana koi acchhee baat nahin he
 He should stay away from doing this work
 aap use kitaaben padhane ke liye to kahiega hi, par saath hi use akaash main udate pakshiyon ko dhoop, dhoop main hare-bhare maidaanon main khile-phulon par mandraati titliyon ko nihaarne kii yaad bhi dilaate rahiega
 i think these things are more useful for him
 main maanata hoon ki skool ke dinon main hi use yah baat bhi siikhnaa hogi ki nakal karke paas hone se fail hona acha he
 Regardless of what others say to be wrong, it must have the ability to stay true to its truth
 dayaalu logon ke saath namrata se pesh aana or bure logon ke saath sakhti se pesh aana chahie
 After listening to all the things of others, he will have to learn from these things in these days
 aap use bataanaa mat bhuuliega ki udaasi ko kis tarah prasannataa main badla ja saktaa he
 And he will also tell you that whenever you feel like crying, do not be ashamed to cry
 meraa sochna he ki use khud par vishwaas hona chahie or dusron par bhi
 Only then will he be able to become a good person
 ye baaten badi hai or lambii bhi
 But whatever you can tell him, it will be good for him
 phir abhi meraa betaa bahut chota he or bahut pyaara bhi
