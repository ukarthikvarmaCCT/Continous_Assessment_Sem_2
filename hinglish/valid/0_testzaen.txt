 Suppose the ellipse of the long axis and the short axis is the desired, then the distance between the nuclei will be 2d = 2 a 2 - b 2 { \ displaystyle 2 { \ sqrt {a ^ {2} -b ^ {2 xxrep 5 }

 is yantra se sugamawapurvak vibhinn maapon or anupaat ke dirghavritt khinche ja sakate hai
 The initial form of the ellipse trammel was that the vaulted metal slab would have two slabs perpendicular to each other at the bottom

 The two sliders studded in these grooves had upward-punched heads, through which there was a barrage, which was fastened with each head

 Thus, the entire ellipse can be drawn only if its width is less than half the length of each slot

 hindi jati kii avadharana dow ramvilas sharma kii mahatvapurn sthapanaaon main se ek he
 In the concept of 'hindi caste' by Dr
 Ramvilas Sharma, the word caste has been used in the sense of nationality and not for race or fraternity
 unhone sarvaadhik bal apni isi manyata par diya
 Due to his establishment, he was also the most controversial and discussed
 avadhi, brajabhasha, bhojpuri, magahi, bundelkhandi, rajasthani aadi boliyon ke bich antarajanapadiya str par hindi kii pramukh bhoomika ko dekhte hue ramvilasaji ne ‘hindi jati’ kii avadharana saamne rakhi, taaki in boliyon ko bolne vaale janapadiya yaa kshetreey pruthakta kii bhaavana se ubar kar hindi ko apni jaateey bhashaa ke rup main sweekaar kar saken
 Ramvilas ji has written in 'nirala's Sahitya Sadhana' section, clarifying this- hindi jati kii avadharana nayi nahin he
 In 'saraswati' of 1902, Shri Karthik Prasad wrote an article called 'abhyudaya of the Maharashtrian race'
 bharat main jaise maharashtriya jati he, usee tarah hindibhashi pradesh main hindi jati bhi he
 In 1930, Dr
 Dhirendra Verma wrote a book called 'hindi Rashtra or Suba Hindustan'
 is pustak main unhone hindi bhashi pradesh kaa suba nirdhaaran kiya
 Dr
 Suniti Kumar Chatterjee has mentioned Hindi speaking caste in a book titled 'aryabhasha and Hindi' published in 1940
 kamil bulke ne ‘ramakatha utpatti or vikaas’ naamak mahatvapurn pustak main ramakatha ke prasang main hindi pradesh kaa ullekh kiya he
 Similarly, in the presidential speech of Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, Rahul ji had discussed in detail the cultural achievements of the Hindi state
 ramvilas sharma ne bade vistaar se madhyakaal se lekar aadhunik kaal tak raajnneetik, aarthik, vyapaarik parivartanon ke pariprekshya main puure desh main hindi ke sahaj, swaabhaavik vikaas kaa itihaas prastut kiya
 In this sequence, he underlined the development of Hindi as the national language, the national language, on the other hand, the fact of Hindi being distinguished as the ethnic language among the dialects of Awadhi, Braj, Bhojpuri etc
 jis tarah bhashaa ke aadhaar par bangla, gujarati, marathi aadi jatiyon kii pahchaan hoti he, usee tarj par hindi pradesh ke log bhi janapadiya boliyon ke aadhaar par pahachaane jane ke bajaay ek hindi bhashi jati ke rup main pahachaane jaaen- unki yahi manshaa thi
 Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma discusses the Hindi caste as well as the Tamil, Telugu, Oriya, Bengali etc
 castes and emphasizes their development
 lekin is baat par ve khed prakat karte hai ki anya bhashaa-bhashi kshetron main jaateeyata kii dharna jitani prabal he utani hindi ke andar nahin he, isi kaaran sampradayikta or jatvaad sarvaadhik isi kshetra main dekhne ko miltaa he

 In this regard, PN Singh rightly writes- "ram Vilas ji lived for a lifetime that Bengali, Punjabi, Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati, Telugu etc
 castes could be formed in India and they could develop into a political entity but in the Hindi territory There was a lack of ethnic perception due to which it remained politically divided

 sahatrarjunavadhah-parashuram vedon kaa adhyaapan prarambh kar dete hai
 They organize a seminar of Brahmins, in which they discuss the qualities that are indispensable to Brahmins and ask them to never violate their duties
 iske pashchaat ve ek nirjan van main tapasya karne ke liye chale jate hai
 Sahasrarjuna comes to the ashram of sage Jamadagni, while Parashurama is away from here
 jamadagni uski or uski sena kaa swaagat kamdhenu gau kii sevaaon dwaara karte hai
 Sahasrarjuna urges Jamadagni to give Kamdhenu to him and says that the king has the right over all the wealth of his subjects
 jab jamadagni uske aagrah ko asweekaar kar dete hai, to sahatrarjun kamdhenu ko balpurvak apni rajdhani mahishmati le jaataa he
 When Parashurama returns, he gets angry knowing this news and alone starts to bring Kamdhenu back
 mahishmati pahunchakar ve sahatrarjun ko yuddh ke liye lalkaarte hai, jise sahatrarjun sweekaar kar letaa he
 Parashurama kills the entire army of Sahasrarjuna in the war
 iske pashchaat parashuram or sahatrarjun ke bich ek bheeshan yuddh prarambh hota he, jisamen donon divya baanon kaa prayog karte hai
 Parashurama then decides that he has given Sahasrarjun an opportunity to entertain at the theater of war too late
 parashuram turant apane paanch sau dhanushon kaa ek saath sandhan karte hai
 Then they destroy the chariot of Sahasrarjuna
 tab sahatrarjun parashuram ke saath dwandv yuddh karte hue un par prahaar karata he
 Before using his ransom to cut Sahasrarjuna's head, Paraुरurāma cuts off all his arms from his xxwrep 2 शु

 Parashurama first visits the Vaishnavite shrines at Chitrakoot, Ayodhya, Mathura, Vrindavan, Haridwar, Mayapuri, Kashi, Kanchi, Ranganath, Avantika and Dwarka
 iske uparant ve shaiva tirthasthalon- somnath, mallikarjun, mahakaal, kareshwar, vaidyanath, bhimashankar, kaashi vishwanath, tryambakeshwar, kedarnath, nageshwar, rameshwar evam ghushmeshwar ke dwadash jyotirling – kii yatra karte hai

 The princes destroy every object and person who comes in their way
 ve gahan dhyaan main magn jamadagni kaa sheesh kaat lete hai or use apane saath mahishmati le jate hai
 When Parashurama returns, he finds the ashram covered with dead bodies
 tabhi unhen jamadagni ke dhad ke sameep renuka karun krandan karti hui dikhaai padati he
 Seeing Parasurama, Renuka mourns her chest 21 times and says how the Haihaya kings killed her husband while Parashurama was still alive? parashuram jamadagni ke dhad ko tel se bhari ek nauka main rakhte hai or renuka se pita ke sharir kii suraksha karne ko kehete hai, jab tak vah vaapis na laut aaen
 The enraged Parashurama alone goes to Mahishmati and shouts at the Haihaya
 ve unki samast sena kaa sanhaar kar dete hai or haihay vansh kaa sampoorn vinaash kar dete hai
 Then they bring Jamadagni's severed head and attach it to the torso, which revives Jamadagni
 raghu evam yadu vanshon ko chhodkar, parashuram kshatriya jati kaa 21 baar prithvi se sanhaar kar dete hai
 Parashuram slaughtered 12000 kings and made five huge pools of blood in Kurukshetra

 ekadantanationam-mahendra parvat par parashuram bhagwaan shiv ke mangalakaari rup kaa dhyaan karte hai or nishchay karte hai ki unka parashu maatr shiv darshan ke uparant hi shaanti praapt kar sakegaa
 When Parashurama reaches Kailash, at the entrance he meets Shiva son Ganesh
 ganesh parashuram se pratiksha karne ke liye kehete hai kyonki shiv abhi sanyakalin sandhya sanskaar main tallin hai
 Parshuram gets angry and starts telling his might and Parshu
 ganesh pratyuttar main unke parashu kii hansee udaane lagate hai, jiskaa prayog unki swayan kii mata evam kshatriya shishuon ke vadh ke liye kiya gaya tha
 Parshuram gets even more enraged and tries to go in using force, but Gajanan Ganesha throws him back with his trunk
 parashuram apana parashu phenkakar ganesh ko kshati pahunchaane kaa praytn karte hai, jisase ganesh kaa baanya daant tut jaataa he
 Shiva's ghost attacks him to kill Parashurama, but Ganesha stops him
 tabhi mata parvati aati hai or parashuram ko apane guru-putr kaa daant todane ke liye daantati hai
 She curses Parshuram with his anger that his parshu will disappear in Rama in the same way as lightning intertwines in the clouds and his bow and arrow will be absorbed in Rama along with his life
 phir vah kahati hai ki ekadant ganesh, jinhone apane daant tuutane kaa pratishodh na lekar swayan par niyantran rakhaa, sarvatra poojit honge
 Parashuram pleases Parvati and apologizes to Ganesha

 They start meditating on the beautiful form of Lord Shri Ram
 sahatrarjun ke maare jane or parashuram dwaara apane shastron kaa tyaag kar die jane par, ravan kii shakti ko chunauti dene vaala ab sansar main koi bhi shoorma nahin he
 Therefore, he starts giving tragedy to the whole earth - he lifts Mount Kailash, tortures all the eight giants, conquers the kingdom of Indra and terrorizes every person who takes a religious stand
 ravan ke atyaachaar ko sahan karne main asamarth hokar, prithvi ek gau kaa rup dhaaran karti he or rudan karti hui sumeru parvat ke paas jaati he

 He praises Lord Rama very beautifully in his 31 verses, praying to incarnate Lord Rama for the destruction
 shriram unhen aashwaasan dete hue kehete hai ki ve sheeghra hi ram ke rup main or apane teen vishnu anshon ke sang- kshirsagaravasi vishnu bharat ke rup main, vaikunthavasi vishnu lakshmana rup main or shwetadipavasi vishnu shatrughna ke rup main-avatar lenge

 maharaj dasharath ayodhya ke rajya kaa shashan kar rahe hai, kintu anek varshon ke pashchaat bhi unhen koi putr utpann nahin hua he
 He approaches his guru Vashistha and expresses to him the unfulfilled desire of his heart
 vashishtha unhen sheeghra hi chaar putron ke janm lene kaa aashwaasan dete hai
 After completing the Ashwamedha, Vishwajit and Rajasuya Yajna, Vashistha invites the sage Rishyasringa to perform the Putreshti Yagya for Dasaratha
 yajna kii samaapti par agnidev kheer kaa ek paatr lekar prakat hote hai
 Dasharatha gives half of Kheer to Kaushalya, fourth to Kaikeyi and two eighths to Sumitra

 On the request of Kaushalya, he assumes the form of a good-natured infant
 kaikeyi bharat ko or sumitra do putron- lakshmana evam shatrughna ko janm detii hai
 Devgan and the subjects of Ayodhya rejoice at the birth of the four sons
 parashuram mahendra parvat par bhagwaan ram ke bal rup kaa dhyaan karte hue or unka gungan 16 padyon main karte hue harsh se romanchit ho uthte hai

 rishi yajyavlky ke shishy raja shirdhvaj janak apane mithila rajya kaa sanchaalan ek yogi ke sadrush kar rahe hai
 While performing the Somayag Yagna with his wife Rani Sunayna in Punyaranya, when King Janaka plots the land on a Baishakh Shukla Paksha Navami with a plow of gold, the earth suddenly explodes and occupies the golden throne and with his eight sings, Bhagwati Jagatjanani Sita Shodashvarshiya Appears from the earth as a teenager
 ek akashwani sita ko janak kii putree udghoshit karti he
 Narada Muni visits Mithila and praises Sita in 16 verses
 taduparant naarad sita se ek shishu kaa rup dhaaran karne kii vinati karte hai
 Janaka and Sunayna bring the infant Sita to their palace and take care of them like their daughter
 ek baar sita janak kii rajdhani ke purvi bhaag main jaati hai or pita janak se pujan kiye ja rahe ek dhanush ke sambandh main puuchhati hai
 King Janaka tells them that it is a Shiva-bow named Pinak, given by Lord Shiva himself to his ancestor Devrat
 sita pita janak se kahati hai ki puraatan vasteen pujan ke bajaay phenkane yogya hai or krida main ghoda banaate hue us baari dhanush ko baarambaar ghaseetne lagati hai
 At Janaka's request, Sita puts the bow - which humans and gods were unable to lift - back in its place
 parashuram yah drishy mahendra parvat par apni samadhi main dekhakar mantrmugdh ho rahe hai or kishori sita kii rup chhavi ke darshan kii abhilaashaa liye mithila kii ore chal padate hai
 13
 Sribhargavamithilagamanam - Even at the age of six, the figure of Sita is like that of a hexagonal teenager
 unke apratim soundarya kaa mahakavi ne 12 padyon main varnan kiya he
 Janaka realizes that instead of his daughter being an ordinary girl, Lord Rama has the primal power, because he is capable of lifting the heavy bow of Shiva despite being an infant
 vah sita ke liye ek suyogy var dhundne ke liye chintit ho uthte hai
 After listening to the doctrine of avatarism in the verses of the Vedas, he is contemplating in this regard, but his knowledge and rationality do not let him believe it
 atyant vichaar manthan karne ke uparant, vah is nishkarsh par pahonchte hai ki yah siddhanth satya hona chahie
 At the same time the gatekeeper announces Parashurama's arrival in Mithila
 raja janak parashuram ko pranaam karte hai
 Considering Janaka as a virtuous king, Parashurama does not see him as his enemy like autocratic Kshatriyas
 parashuram unke samaksh sita ke darshan kii apni abhilaashaa prakat karte hai
 Janaka takes him to the Yagyashala, where Parashurama drags Shiva Dhanush into a sports horse and sees Bhagwati Sita playing with him
 parashuram janak se sita swayamvar kaa aayojan karne ko kehete hai, jisamen shiv dhanush ko todane main sakasham rajkumaar hi sita ke panigrahan ke yogya ho
 Subsequently Parashurama predicts that only Ram, a descendant of Raghu, will break the bow
 parashuram janak se kehete hai ki ve punah mithila main kupit hone kaa abhinay karte hue aaenge jisase ki unhen sita or ram donon ke darshan kaa bahaanaa praapt ho sake

 Ahalyodharanam - Janaka ensures the day of Sita Swayamvara, after consulting with his ministers and demigods
 isi bich ayodhya main raja dasharath apane putr ram ke vivaah ke sambandh main chintit ho uthte hai
 The demonic Tadka Muni repeatedly interrupts Vishwamitra's yajna
 vishwamitra raja dasharath ke darbar main aate hai or apane yajna kii rakshason se raksha hetu ram or lakshmana kii yachana karte hai
 At the thought of Rama leaving him, Dasaratha hesitates and considers himself to be perishable, but Guru Vasistha persuades him to send Rama and Lakshmana
 vishwamitra ram evam lakshmana ko apane van main le jate hai, jahaan ram tadka kaa vadh karte hai, jab vah vrikshon or shilaon kii varsha kar teenon par akraman karti he
 Vishwamitra grants Rama and Lakshmana two disciplines called Bala and Atibala, which are capable of sustaining them even without eating, drinking and sleeping
 vishwamitra apane samast divyastra bhi ram ko samarpit kar dete hai
 Ram and Lakshman protect Vishwamitra's yagna for six days and six nights continuously
 saatven din, rakshas bhai marich or subahu ek vishaal sena ke saath yajna par akraman karte hai
 Rama uses the Manavastra to throw Marich across the ocean, while by destroying the firearms, he kills Subahu

 shriraghavpriyadarshanam-vishwamitra, ram or lakshmana ke sang mithila main padhaarte hai
 Shri Ram is ecstatic on reaching Mithila city, but the other kings, who have come for Sita Swayamvara, are not happy with the arrival of Rama
 mithila ke naagarik ram kaa darshan kar aanandamagn ho jate hai
 When King Janaka expresses his curiosity with the two princes about Vishwamitra, Vishwamitra introduces Ram and Lakshmana to Janaka
 janak donon rajkumaron ko apane mahal main le aate hai or unka swaagat karte hai
 After this, Lakshmana expresses his desire to see the city of Mithila in front of Rama and after getting the permission of Rama Guru and walks with him
 mithila ke balak ram or lakshmana ko nagari main chaaron ore bhraman karaate hai or ant main ram kaa aalingan sukh praapt karte hai
 On the second day, at dawn, Rama and Lakshmana enter Janaka's state garden to choose flowers for the worship of Vishwamitra
 swayamvar ke ek din purv sita bhi usee udyaan main gauri pujan ke liye padharti hai
 Sita and Rama see each other for the first time when they come face to face in the garden
 ram lakshmana se sita ke prati apane aakarshan ke bare main bataate hai
 He tells Lakshmana that Sita will definitely be his wife in the future because her mind has never wished for a woman in her dreams
 tab lakshmana sita ko apni bhabhi maan ke rup main pranaam karte hai
 On the other hand, Sita adorns the beautiful image of Shriram in her heart and worships him and returns to her palace after worshiping Gauri
 shriram evam lakshmana vishwamitra ke sameep lautate hai or janak ke rajkeey udyaan ke pushpon se unki archana karte hai
 Shriram tells Vishwamitra everything about the attraction generated towards Sita in his heart
 vishwamitra ram kii nishchhalata se prasann hokar unhen aashirvachan pradaan karte hai or shayan karne ke liye chale jate hai
 Today Rama is awake even at night, he is praising the beauty of the moon, which is reminding him of Sita's mouthful
 17
 sitaswayamvaram-agle din praatah shriram evam lakshmana jaagate hai or vishwamitra ko pranaam karte hai
 The three visit Sita together in Swayamvara
 bal, yuva evam vruddh or mithila kii navyauvanaayen shriram kii sundar rupachhavi ke darshan kar anandamugdh ho jaati hai
 Seeing King Janak Rama, he prays in his mind that he should break the bow of Shiva Dhanush
 sita swayamvar kii sabha main upasthit logon ke baarah vibhinn samooh ram ko vibhinn baarah bhaavon kii drushti se yukt hokar dekhte hai
 The Charan king of Mithila proclaims the pledge of Janaka that the prince who makes a Shiva bow to Pinaka will be entitled to the seeding of Sita
 sabha main upasthit banasur, ravan or anek raja dhanush ko uthaane kaa praytn karte hai kintu asafal hote hai
 Then ten thousand kings try to lift the bow together, but are not able to
 raja janak niraash hokar samast raajaaon se apane-apane ghar laut jane ko kehete hai
 He says that if the earth is devoid of heroes, he would prefer to keep Sita a virgin
 sabha main janak ke in shabdon ko sunakar lakshmana krodhit ho uthte hai, kintu shriram apane netron ke sanket se unhen shant kar dete hai
 Vishwamitra orders Rama to break the bow
 shriram dhanush ko trin ke samaan uthaa lete hai or use turant do tukdon main tod daalate hai
 In the midst of the sound of Vedic chants by Vishwamitra, Sita wears Rama to Jaimal
 raja janak shriram ko naman karte hue unki stuti karte hai
 18
 Shree Bhargavalakshman Samvad: Parashurama on Mahendra mountain knows that Lord Rama has broken a pinnacle in Mithila
 ve yah bhi samaj jate hai ki kuch dusht raja shiv dhanush ko uthaane main asafal rahane ke pashchaat bhi sita ko balpurvak le jane or ram evam lakshmana ko bandi banane kii yojana bana rahe hai
 Remembering the words of his guru, Parashurama comes to the assembly of Mithila, acting in a rage as part of his last Lila
 unki upasthiti sabha main virajman samast kshatriya raajaaon ko aatankit kar detii he or ve sabhi shant ho jate hai
 Janaka salutes Parashurama and also salutes Sita
 parashuram agyanta kaa pradarshan karte hai or janak se unke guru kaa dhanush todane vaale apradhi ko dikhaane ko kehete hai
 Ram respectfully tells Parasurama that he will be the only slave to break the bow and plead for his refuge
 parashuram ram se das kii bhaanti aacharan karne or unke apradhi ko bheed se pruthak karne ke aadesh kaa paalan karne ko kehete hai
 Seeing Parashurama insulting Rama, Lakshmana immediately becomes enraged and responds to him by laughing at Parashurama
 donon ke madhya ek vaak-yuddh prarambh ho jaataa he, jisamen lakshmana parashuram kii dhamkiyon kaa budhimattapurna vyangyoktion dwaara pratyuttar dete hai
 When Lakshmana ridicules Parashurama and repeatedly recounts all his threats, Parashurama gets angry and picks up his hand and proceeds to kill Lakshmana
 usee samay shriram parashuram ko shant karne ke liye bolnaa prarambh kar dete hai
 19
 Sriraghave Bhargava Pravesh: - Shri Ram troubles the anger of Parashuram with his humble words
 ram sweekaar karte hai ki unhone vishwamitra dwaara aadesh die jane par hi dhanush todaa he
 He calls Parashurama his guru and himself his disciple
 ram parashuram se lakshmana ke apmanjanak vachanon ke liye kshamaa maangate hai
 When Rama is speaking like this, Lakshmana looks at Parashurama and smiles again
 isse parashuram punah agbabula ho uthte hai or yah kehete hue ki ve koi saamaanya brahman nahin hai, ram ko dwandv yuddh ke liye lalkaarte hai
 Rama earnestly pleads with Parashurama that the duel war only takes place between his counterparts and that he is not capable of fighting duel with Parashurama
 ve parashuram se kehete hai ki vah sarvashaktimaan hai kintu phir bhi brahmanon ke das hai
 Thereafter, Shriram reveals his Mahavishnu form to Parashurama and makes him see the Bhrigu's step sign on his chest
 apane purvaj ke charanchihn ko dekhakar parashuram krodh ke abhinay ko tyaag dete hai
 They ask Sri Ram to offer a counter-attack to a Vishnu bow called Sharga
 jaise hi ve shaarg dhanush ram ko saunpte hai, unka parashu antardhan ho jaataa he or unke samast shastr jaakar ram main villin ho jate hai
 His aura also enters into Shri Ram
 ram vaishnav dhanush par pratyancha kaa sandhan kar us par ek baan chadha lete hai
 Parashurama's acting with suspicion also ends
 tab parashuram ram kii baarah sundar shlokon main stuti karte hai
 Shriram tells Parashuram that his arrow is unfailing
 ve parashuram se poochhate hai ki ve is baan kaa prayog parashuram kii prithvi par svachhand vicharan karne kii shakti ko nasht karne main karen athwa parashuram dwaara tapasya se arjeet falon ko nasht karne main karen
 Sriram again reveals his Mahavishnu form to Parashurama and then falls at his feet, welcoming Parashurama's commandments
 sabha main samupasthit samast logon ke prashansaatmak udgaaron ke madhya parashuram ram se apane charnon se uthne ke liye kehete hai or unka aalingan kar lete hai
 Then they ask Rama to destroy the fruits obtained from his tenacity in place of variance power
 shriram aisa hi karte hai
 Parashuram starts praising them
 20
 shribhargavakritaraghavstvanam-yah sampoorn sarg stavnatmak he
 Parashurama praises Rama in a hundred verses

 ek niqusantan danpati jo baccha chaahate the, deevaaron se ghire ek aise baghiche ke bagal main rahete the, jo ek jaaduugarani kaa tha
 The wife, as a result of her much-awaited pregnancy, saw a Rapunzel plant growing in the garden and became extremely eager to eat it
 lagaataar do raat, apni patni kii khwaahish ko puraa karne ke iraade se pati diwaar faand kar baag main ghusaa or use chupake se le aayaa, lekin teesri raat jab vah ghar lautne ke liye diwaar par chadh rahaa tha, to "dame gothel" naamak us jaaduugarani ne use ja dabocha or us par chori kaa aarope lagaaya
 usne dayaa kii bheekh maangi, vah budhiya maan gai, lekin is shart par ki vah pet main pal rahe bachche ko janm ke baad use saunp degaa
 The helpless husband agreed
 jab beti paidaa hui, to jaaduugarani use le gai or uskaa naam rapanzel rakhte hue abhibhavak ke rup main paalan-poshan kiya
 When Rapunzel was twelve years old, the sorceress locked her in a tower in the midst of the wilderness, with no stairs to climb, nor a door to enter, only in a room and a window
 When the magician went to meet Rapunzel, she stood under the tower and called him saying: in shabdon ko sunne par, rapanzel khidki kii bagal main tangi ek khunti se apane lambey, sunahare bal lapet kar unhen jaaduugarani ke paas neeche lataka detii thi, jo un baalo ke sahare chadh kar rapanzel ke paas minar ke kamare main pahunch jaati thi
 In one version of the story, the sorceress had the power to fly in the air and the woman was unaware of the length of her hair
 ek din, ghode par savaar ek rajkumaar jangal se guzar rahaa tha or usne minar main gaati hui rapanzel ko suna
 uski alokik awaz se sammohit hokar, vah yuvati kii talash main niklaa or minar ko paaya, lekin vah usamen pravesh karne main asamarth tha
 Later he started coming there often, listening to her melodious singing and one day he saw Dame Gothel there and thus knew how to gain access to Rapunzel
 jab dame gothel chali gai, to usne rapanzel se apane bal neeche latakaane kaa anurodh kiya
 When he did so, he climbed up, reached out to her and finally proposed marriage to her
 rapanzel is par sahamat ho gai
 Together the two plan to escape, according to which he will meet her every night and bring silk for her, from which Rapunzel will slowly weave the ladder
 The prince is caught by Rapunzel's stupidity before the plan succeeds
 grimes fayari tels ke pratham sanskaran main, rapanzel maasoomiyat se kahati he ki uske vastra xxrep 4 ] krodh main, dame gothel rapanzel ke baalo kii laten kaat daalati he or use baahar ghaney jangal main swayan apni raksha karne ke liye bhej detii he
 When the prince reaches there that night and calls him, the sorceress hangs down the severed peak to elevate him
 rapanzel kii jagah jaaduugarani ko apane saamne paakar rajkumaar bhaybheet ho jaataa he
 When she angrily tells him that he will never meet Rapunzel again, he jumps from the tower and is blinded by the thorns lying beneath
 ek or sanskaran main, jaaduugarani use dhakka detii he or vah kaanton par jaakar girtaa he, jisase vah andhaa ho jaataa he
 For months he wanders in the wastelands of the country
 ek din, jab rapanzel pani bharte hue gaanaa gaati he, to rajkumaar rapanzel kii awaz ko dubaara sunata he or un donon kaa milan ho jaataa he
 As they clasp each other's arms, Rapunzel's tears bring back the prince's vision
 ek or pathantar main, yah kaha jaataa he ki rapanzel ne antat do bacchon ko janm diya 
 The prince takes her to his kingdom, where they live happily ever after
 kahani ke ek anya roopantaran main, samaapan main bataaya jaataa he ki minar se rajkumaar ke kudane ke baad jaaduugarani rapanzel kii chotii kholti he, lekin vah uske haathon se phisal kar minar ke neeche gir jaati he
 This leaves the sorceress trapped in the tower itself

 It is difficult to determine what species of the plant Grimm from the word Rapunzel meant, but the following, listed in his own dictionary, are candidates
 yashpal kaa naam aadhunik hindi sahitya ke kathakaron main pramukh he
 They are simultaneously known in both revolutionary and author forms
 premchand ke baad hindi ke suprasiddh pragatisheel kathakaron main inkaa naam liya jaataa he
 Yashpal was associated with the revolutionary movement from his student life, as a result of which he had to spend a long time in jail and jail
 iske baad inhone sahitya ko apana jivan banaaya, jo kaam kabhi inhone bandook ke madhyam se kiya tha, ab vahi kaam inhone bulatin ke madhyam se janajagran kaa kaam shuru kiya
 Yashpal was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1970 by the Government of India in the field of literature and education
 yashpal kaa janm 3 disambar 1903 ko punjab main, firospur chhavnee main ek saadhaaran khatri parivaar main hua tha
 His mother, Mrs
 Premdevi was a teacher in a school in the orphanage there
 yashpal ke pita heeralaal ek saadhaaran kaarobaari vyakti the
 His ancestral village was Rangad, where his ancestors had once settled and settled in Hamirpur
 pita kii ek choti-si dukaan thi or unke vyavsaay ke kaaran hi log unhen ‘lala’ kehete-pukaarte the
 In between, they used to carry goods on horseback and go to the nearby villages for ferrying
 apane vyavsaay se jo thodaa-bahut paisa unhone ikattha kiya tha use ve, bina kisi pukhta likhaa-padhi ke, hath udhaaru taur par sood par uthaaya karte the
 He was uninterested in his family
 isiilie yashpal kii maan apane do beton—yashpal or dharmpal—ko lekar firozpur chhavnee main arya samaaj ke ek skool main padhaate hue apane bacchon kii shiksha-diksha ke bare main kuch adhik hi sajag thim
 His mother and this environment have played a pivotal role in the development of Yashpal's intense hatred towards poverty, the attraction of Arya Samaj and the freedom movement
 yashpal ke rachanaatmak vikaas main unke bachapan main bhogi gai garibi kii ek vishisht bhoomika thi
 In his childhood, Yashpal had heard many stories of terror and strange behavior of the British
 barsaat yaa dhoop se bachane ke liye koi hindustani angrezon ke saamne chaataa lagaae nahin guzar saktaa tha
 The main roads in the big cities and mountains were for them, Hindustani used to walk on the rough roads built under these roads
 yashpal ne apane hosh main in baton ko sirf suna, dekha nahin, kyonki tab tak angrezon kii prabhutaa ko asweekaar karanevaale krantikari andolan kii chingaariyaan jagah-jagah footne lagi thim
 But whatever Yashpal saw in his childhood, it was enough to inflame hatred for the British
 ve likhte hai, ‘‘maine angrezon ko sadak par sarv saadhaaran janata se salaami lete dekha he
 Have seen Hindustani begging in front of him, guessed his disrespect and felt opposition to him
 

’ In the context of his hatred against the British and later British imperialism, Yashpal specifically mentions two incidents of his childhood
 inamen se pehali ghatana unke chaar-paanch varsh kii aayu kii he
 Then one of his relatives was a manager in a cotton ginning factory in Yulekprant
 kaarkaanaa stesan ke paas hi kaam karne vaale angrezon ke do-chaar bangle the
 There was a lot of terror around these people
 inamen se ek bangle main murdiyaan pali thim, jo aas-paas kii sadak par gumti-phirti thim
 One evening Yashpal started teasing those hens
 bangle main rahanevaali mem sahiba ne is harqat par bacchon ke fatkaar diya
 Probably abused someone like 'donkey' or 'owl'
 chaar-paanch varsh ke balak yashpal ne bhi uski gaali kaa pratyuttar gaali se hi diya
 When the woman threatened to kill them, they also responded by threatening her in the same way and then ran away and hid in the factory
 lekin ghatana yun hi taal di janevaali nahin thi
 Complaint was made with his relative
 unhone yashpal kii maan se shikaayat kii or anek ashankaon or aatank ke bich yah bhi bataaya ki isse puure kaarakaane ke logon par kaisaa sankat aa saktaa he
 Then, mentioning its result, Yashpal writes, 'my mother beat me very well with a stick, i got hit on the ground but the beating continued
 is ghatana ke parinaam se mere man main angrezon ke prati kisi bhaavana utpann hui hogi, yah bhaanp lenaa kathin nahin he
 


 ' duusari ghatana kuch iske baad kii he
 Then Yashpal's mother was headmaster at Arya Kanya Pathshala in Kashipur town of Tirai in Nainital district, in Yuktprant
 shahar se kaafii dur, kaarkaane se hi sambandhi ko bada-sa awaas mila tha or yashpal kii maan bhi vahiin rahati thi
 There was a pond called 'drona Sagar' near the house
 ghar kii striyaan praayah hi vahaan dopaher main ghoomane chali jaati thim
 One day those women were taking a bath there, on the other side of it, two British white soldiers, suddenly appeared
 striyaan unhen dekhakar bhay se chinane lageen or aatmaraksha main ek-duusare se lipatate hue, bhaybheet hokar usee avasthaa main apane kapadeuthakar bhaagane lageen
 Yashpal also eloped with them
 ghatit kuch vishesh nahin hua lekin angrezon se is tarah darkar bhaagane kaa drishy sthaayee rup se unki bal-smriti main tank gaya
 

 'that fear from the British was like seeing a tiger in a flock of goats would be afraid, that is, the English could do anything
 usase darkar rone or chinane ke sivaay doosraa koi upaay nahin tha
 

 ' arya samaaj or congress ve padaav the jinhen paar karke yashpal antat krantikari sanghathan kii ore aae
 His mother wanted to make him a fiery propagator of Swami Dayanand's ideals
 isi uddeshy se unki aarambhik shiksha gurukul kangri main hui
 The seeds of fiery backlash against Arya Samaj oppression fell here on the land of his mind
 yaheen unhen punarutthanavaadee pravritiyon ko bhi nikat se dekhne-samajhane kaa avasar mila
 He also had a painful experience of his poverty here
 apane bachapan main bhi garib hone ke aparaadh ke prati ve apane ko kisi prakaar uttaradaayi nahin samaj pate
 Due to these values, he could never be indifferent to the insult of the poor
 congress yashpal kaa doosraa padaav thi
 Like many others of his era, he too entered politics through the Congress
 rajnatik drushti se firozpur chhavnee ek shant jagah thi
 Three miles away from the cantonment there used to be lectures and proms of the city
 khaddar kaa prachaar bhi hota tha
 In 1921, Yashpal was an eighteen-year-old youth at the time of the non-cooperation Movement — full of zeal for patriotism and patriotism, he also participated in the Congress campaign with foreign cloth Holi
 ghar ke hi luggad se bane khaddar ke kurtta-pyjama or gandhi topi pahante the
 He also made a coat of this Khaddar
 baar-baar mailaa ho jane se uubakar unhone use laal rangava liya tha
 In his speeches during this period, as a source of anti-british imperialism statistics, the book he mentions called Desh Darshan is probably Sankharam Ganesh Deuskar's Bengali book Desherkatha, published in 1904, whose impression on the Indian public is widespread
 The British government was banned because of the reaction and popularity
 mahatma gandhi or gandhivaad se yashpal ke taatkaalik mohabhang kaa kaaran bhale hi 12 farvari san 22 ko, chaura-chauri kand ke baad mahatma gandhi dwaara andolan ke sthagan kii ghoshnaa rahaa ho, lekin isaki shuruyaat or pehle ho chuki thi
 Gandhi's principle of non-violence went against the agenda of armed revolution of Yashpal and his revolutionary comrades
 mahatma gandhi dwaara dharm or raajnneeti kaa ghaal-mail unhen kahin buniyadi rup se galat lagata tha
 After coming to Lahore after matriculation, Yashpal came into contact with Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Bhagwati Charan Bohra at National College
 noujvaan bharat sabha kii gatividhiyon main unki vyapak or sakriy hissedari vastutah gandhi or gandhivaad se unke mohabhang kii ek anivaary parinaam thi
 The main sources of the Naujawan Bharat Sabha were Bhagwati Charan and Bhagat Singh
 sake lakshyon par tappanee karte hue yashpal likhte hai, ‘noujvaan bharat sabha kaa kaarykram gandhivaadi congress kii samjhautavaadi niti kii aalochana karke janata ko us rajnatik kaarykram kii prerana dena or janata main krantikariyon or mahatma gandhi tathaa gandhivaadiyon ke bich ek buniyadi antar kii ore sanket karnaa upyogi hoga
 Despite fierce opposition from Lala Lajpat Rai's Hinduist policies due to the lathi charge on him, which ultimately led to his death, Bhagat Singh and his associates killed Sanders
 is ghatana ko unhone ek rashtriya apmaan ke rup main dekha jiske pratirodh ke liye aapasi matbhedon ko bhula dena jaruri tha
 The bombing by Bhagat Singh in the assembly was a logical culmination of this thinking, but Mahatma Gandhi did not issue any formal appeal, despite widespread pressure from the public to protest against the hanging of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru
 apane krantikari jivan ke jo sansmaran yashpal ne simhavlokan main likhe, unamem apni drushti se unhone us andolan or apane saathiyon kaa moolyankan kiya
 He has always emphasized rationality, reality and reliability
 yah sambhav he ki us moolyankan se bahuton ko asahmati ho yaa yashpal par tathyon ko tod-marodakar prastut karne kaa aarope ho
 Even today there are some people, who do not consider Yashpal very good revolutionary
 unke krantikari jivan ke prasang main unke charitrahanan kii durbhasandhiyon ko hi ve puri tarah sach maanakar chalate hai or shaayad isiilie yashpal kii ore meri nirantar or baar-baar vaapasi ko ve ‘ret kii murti’ gadhane-jaisaa kuch maanate hai
 They also see 'revolution' confined to the politics of bomb-holistic politics
 raajnneetik kranti yashpal ke liye saamaajik vyavastha main krantikari parivartan kaa hi ek hissaa thi
 He saw imperialism as an exploitative system which, in Bhagat Singh's words, 'is the extreme form of exploitation of man in the hands of man and nation in the hands of the nation' 

 Jagmohan and Chamanlal, ed
 19, p
 321)
 The pillar-jagirdari and Zamindari system of this system were likewise under the main agenda of their opposition
 desh main jis rup main swadhinata ai or bahuton kii tarah, ve bhi santusht nahin the
 More than independence, they considered it a transfer of power
 or yah lagbhag vaisaa hi tha jise kabhi premchand ne jon kii jagah govind ko gaddi par baith jane ke rup main apni ashanka vyakt kii thi
 Revolutionary nations were youth driven by spirit of devotion and sacrifice
 avasar aane par unhone hameshaa balidaan se ise pramanit bhi kiya
 But Yashpal insists on seeing his comrades as jealous, hostile, competition-seeking ordinary humans
 apane sansmaranon main aaj rajendra yadav jise adarsh ghoshit karte hai—‘ve devtaa nahin hai’—uski shuruyaat hindi main vastutah yashpal ke inhen sansmaranon se hoti he
 These revolutionaries were not isolated from ordinary human beings, despite being somewhat different, typical and devoted exclusively to their goals
 ho bhi sakate the
 Sharat Chandra presented the ideal of revolutionaries in Pathredawi, Yashpal considered it to be real, which inspires patriotism, cannot be considered a representative and authentic picture of the revolutionary movement and that life
 subodhachandra sen gupt patheradavi main bijli panivali jhanjhawati raat main savyasachi ke nishakraman ko bhavi mahanayake subhaashachandr bose ke palaayan ke ek roopak ke taur par dekhte hai, jabaki yashpal savyasachi ke atimanviya se lagane vaale kaary-kalapon or khoh-khandhiron main bitaye janevaale jivan ko vaastavik or pramanik nahin maanate
 He uses his long experiences of revolutionary life as the mainstay of his criticism
 2, march san 38 ko jail se rihaai ke baad, jab usee varsh november main yashpal ne viplav kaa prakaashan-sampadan shuru kiya to apane is kaam ko unhone ‘bullate bulatin’ ke rup main paribhaashit kiya
 He made writing his base to carry forward the unfinished work of the non-violent and egalitarian society he wanted to build through political revolutionaries
 apane samay kii saamaajik-raajnneetik samasyaon ke kendra main rakhkar likhe gaye sahitya ko praayah hameshaa hi vichaarvaadi kahkar laanchit kiya jaataa he
 This was Nand Dulare Vajpayee's big charge against Premchand
 apane upar lagaae gaye prachaar ke aarope kaa yashpal ne uttar bhi lagbhag premchand kii hi tarah diya
 In the role of his first novel, Dada Comrade, he wrote, 'I have a complaint to the lovers of art that i give priority to art and to the promotion of art
 mere prati die gaye is faisale ke viruddh mujhe apil nahin kerani
 Santosh is able to make his intent clear 


 Later commenting on his literary concerns in more detail, he later wrote, 'the struggle for the complete development and liberation of man is the meaning of the author
 jab lekhak apni kala ke madhyam se manushya kii mukti ke liye puraani vyavastha or vichaaron main antarvirodh dikhaata he or nae adarsh saamne rakhata he to us par adarshaheen or bhautikwaadi hone kaa laanchhan lagaaya jaataa he
 Today's writer has his roots in reality, so he is not only materialistic but he is also not ideal
 uske adarsh adhik yatharth hai
 When the writer of today supports new ideals through his art, he is accused of being a preacher
 lekhak sadaa hi apni kala se kisi vichaar yaa adarsh ke prati sahanubhuti yaa virodh paidaa karata he
 a meaningful literature will be there
 yashpal ke lekhan kii pramukh vidha upanyaas he, lekin apane lekhan kii shuruuaat unhone kahaniyon se hi kii
 His stories are not beset by the politics of his time, such as his novels
 nai kahani ke daur main stri ke deh or man ke kritrim vibhaajan ke viruddh ek sampurna stri kii jis chhavi par jor diya gaya, uski vaastavik shuruuaat yashpal se hi hoti he
 How many stories of Yashpal have been used as fertilizer in the direction of thinking of today's story
 vartmaan or aagat katha-paridrishy kii sambhaavnaaon kii drushti se unki sarthakata asandigdh he
 His story-collections include cage flight, enlightenment, ashes of chinagari, flower kurta, crusade, why did you say i am beautiful and Uttami's mother is the chief
 jo or jaisi duniya banane ke liye yashpal sakriy raajnneeti se sahitya kii ore aae the, uskaa nakshaa unke aage shuru se bahut kuch spasht tha
 He made the basis of the actual achievements of the system in place of a utopia
 yashpal kii vaicharik yatra main yah sutara shuru se ant tak sakriy dikhaai detaa he ki janata kaa vyapak sahyog or sakriy bhagidaari hi kisi raashtra ke nirmaan or vikaas ke mukhya kaarak hai

 kray-abhikray ek prakaar kaa anubandh he jiskaa vikaas euke main hua
 Nowadays it is prevalent in China, India, Japan, Australia and New Zealand
 isko band-lijing bhi kehete hai
 When a buyer is unable to pay the value of a property in a lump sum but has the ability to deposit a small part of that value, the purchaser can borrow the property in exchange for the monthly rent using a purchase-purchase contract
 kainada or uese main ise 'kist yojana' kehete hai
 The purchase-contract-contract is considered a category of contract
 kray-abhikray ke niyaman ke liye koi swatantra vidhi nahin he
 Therefore, in addition to the terms of the contract, the rules of the contract law apply to it
 bombai hoicourt ke matanusaar kray-abhikray kii pratha kaa udai england main hua or vahiin se is prakaar ke anubandh bharat main bhi prachlit hue
 The legal meaning of purchase is - the owner of an article, in addition to raising his property at a certain rent, also pledges that the owner of the said item will sell the item when the owner of the said item satisfies the terms of the contract Will give
 isi se miltaa julata kray-vikray kaa ek tarika or bhi he jisamen kreta vastu kaa sampurna mulya vastuvikray ke samay adaa na karke kishton main adaa karne kii suvidha praapt kar letaa he
 We can call it a contract to sell
 vastuvikray ke in do prakaaron main prakat samya hote hue bhi chaar moulik antar hai- In the purchase-purchase contract, the item is delivered immediately to the renter
 kintu vikray anubandh se vastu ko turant kreta ke supurd karnaa aavashyak nahin hota
 The decision to ultimately buy or not to buy an item in purchase-purchase depends on the will of the person renting the item
 vikray-anubandh main ichha kaa prashn nahin uthta kyonki usamen vastu kaa vikray sampadit ho chukaa hota he, keval mulya kii adaayagi jari rahati he
 In purchase, this item can be returned to the owner of the item at any time within the time period stipulated in the contract
 at: swabhaavat: us vastu kaa usee samay tak kiraaya adaa karne kaa uttardaayitv abhikreta par hota he
 This question does not arise in the sales contract and the seller is entitled to recover the amount of all installments as the sale of the goods has been completed
 kray abhikray main yadhyapi vastu abhikreta ke supurd kar di jaati he tathaapi vastu kaa swaamitv us samay tak vastu ke malik main hi nihit rahata he jab tak ki abhikreta vastu kray k rane kaa nishchay prakat nahin karata
 But in the sale contract, although the payment of the price continues in installments, the ownership of the goods sold is vested in the buyer
 is antar kaa prabhaav yah he ki vikray anubandh main yadi vikreta kreta ko vastu hastantarit nahin karata to kreta vastu ke hastantaran ke liye daawa kar saktaa he or yadi kreta kishton kii adaayagi nahin karata to vikreta mulya kii vasuuli kaa daawa kar saktaa he
 But if the installment of the rent is not paid in the response, the owner of the item can claim the return of that item and the rent till that time
 saamaanya rup se kray-abhikray ke liye do pakshon kii hi aavashyaktaa hoti he vastu ke swami or abhikreta kii
 But along with the expansion of this type of trade exchange, there has also been the emergence of financial support organizations which provide the location of the owner of the commodity by establishing contact with the said two parties
 vastu vikray ke in prakaaron main tatsambandhi pakshon ke adhikaar tathaa uttardaayitv main antar hota he at: is prashn kaa nirnay ki koi samjhauta abhikrashnubandh he athwa vikrashnubandh, us samjhaute kii sharton ke arthvishleshan par hi nirbhar karata he
 The sale or reaction is not as important in the terms of the agreement as it is to see what the real intention of both parties is
 yadi vastu praapt karanevaale par vastu lene kaa koi bhaar nahin he or vastu kaa swami bananaa yaa na bananaa uski ichha par chhod diya gaya he to kray vikray, kist aadi shabdon ke prayog ke baavjood use abhikray hi mana jayega
 Since purchase-contract is only a type of contract, the rules of minor contractual law also apply to it
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki kray abhikray keval chal sampatti ke liye hi nahin, achal sampatti ke liye bhi prayukt kiya ja saktaa he
