 It is that branch of medical science, which is concerned with keeping the human body healthy, freeing or diagnosing the disease in case of disease, and increasing age
 bharat ayurvigyaan kaa janmdata he
 In its early times, medicine was studied in the same way as a branch of biology
 baad main 'sharir rachana' tathaa 'sharir kriya vigyaan' aadi ko iskaa aadhaar banaaya gaya
 The birth of medicine in India was several thousand years BC
 It was initially studied as a branch of biology, and anatomy and physiology were made the basis of it
 sharir main honevaali kriyaaon ke gyaan se pataa laga ki unka rup bahut kuch rasinic he or ye ghatnaayen raasaanik kriyaaon ke fal hai
 As soon as the discovery took place, the chemical form of the events of the body came out
 is prakaar rasayan vigyaan kaa itnaa mahatv badha ki vah ayurvigyaan kii ek pruthak shakha ban gaya, jiskaa naam jeevarsayan rakhaa gaya
 By this, not only the form of physical events became clear, but also the origin of diseases and methods of resistance came out
 saath hi bhautik vigyaan ne bhi shaareerik ghatnaon ko bhalee bhanti samajhane main bahut sahaayta di
 It is known that many events happen according to physical rules
 ab jeevarsayan kii bhanti jeevbhautikee bhi ayurvigyaan kaa ek ang ban gai he or usase bhi rogon kii utpatti ko samajhane main tathaa unka pratirodh karne main bahut sahaayta mili he
 Other branches of science have also helped a lot in disease prevention and medicine
 or in sabake sahyog se manushya ke kalyaan main bahut pragati hui he, jiske falswaroop jeevankaal bad gaya he
 Many kinds of experimental methods and instruments, which have been made from time to time, have been very helpful in acquiring a subtle knowledge of the body, physical phenomena and internal functions related to the disease
 kintu is gahan adhyayan kaa fal yah hua ki ayurvigyaan anek shakhaon main vibhakt ho gaya or prayek shakha main itani khoj hui he, naveen upkaran bane hai tathaa praayogic vidhiyaan gyaat kii gai hai ki koi bhi vidvan yaa vidhyaarthee un sab se purnataya parichit nahin ho saktaa
 Day by day, the doctor has to depend on laboratories and equipment and this dependency is increasing progressively
 prayek shiksha kaa dhyey manushya kaa maansik vikaas hota he, jisase usamen tark karke samajhane or tadnusaar apane bhaavon ko prakat karne tathaa karyanvit karne kii shakti utpann ho jaay
 This is also the aim of medical education
 iske liye sab ayurvigyaan ke vidhyaarthiyon main vidhyaarthee ko upasnaatak ke rup main paanch varsh bitaane padate hai
 In medical colleges, students are admitted on the basis of studying the basic sciences and getting higher secondary education

 The aim of every teacher and student of medical schools should also be that he should try to advance the art of this antidote by searching for new anti-inflammatory items

 lagbhag teen saal baad 17 farvari 2004 ko rana filmi andaaj main tihaad jail se faraar ho gaya
 The escape of a prisoner from a highly protected prison like Tihar was a big thing in itself
 isliye rana ekaek phir surkhiyon main aa gaya
 But on 17 May 2006, Rana was arrested again from a guest house in Kolkata
 apane faraari ke dinon ke bare main rana ne daawa kiya ki afghanistan ke gazani ilaake main hindu samraat prithviraj chouhan kii rakhi asthiyon ke apmaan kii jaankaree milane ko lekar vah behad dukhi tha or usne use waapas laane kii thaanee

 locard vinimay siddhanth nyaayalayik vigyaan kaa ek siddhanth jise dow admond locard ne 1877-1966 main diya tha
 This theory shows that if two things come in contact with each other, there is an exchange between them
 agar do chize ek dusre ke sampark main ai he to uname pehali vastu kaa kuch bhaag duusari vastu ke paas or duusari vastu kaa kuch bhaag pehle ke paas janaa saamaanya baat he
 And this rule applies to everything
 locard siddhanth yah bhi darshata he kii har ek saboot apana nishaan chodta he
 If a criminal goes to any incident site, they are left with some clues, cautiously or unknowingly, that give evidence of his being there
 jaise kii ghatnasthal par apradhi ke ungaliyon ke nishaan, uske paanv kii chhap, juuton par lagi mitti, yaa phir ghatnasthal par pai jane vaali vastuon kaa apradhi ke kapadon se laganaa
 All these clues reflect the Locard principle
 yah sabhi bhautik-shaastra se jade aise pahalu hai jo ghatnasthal se baraamad kiye jate hai to yah 100% sachai bayaan karte hai
 It is only with the help of these physicists that the crime is committed and the culprit is traced
 jab koi nyaayalayik vaigyanik kisi bhi ghatnasthal par jaanch ke liye jaataa he to vah sabase pehle vahaan par maujuud bhautik vastuon ko hi dekhtaa he jisase ki vah yah anumaan laga letaa he kii jo bhi kathith ghatana hui he vah sach he yaa jhooth or iske saath-saath vah yah bhi anumaan laga letaa he kii apradhi koun ho saktaa he
 All this is possible only with the help of the lowcard exchange principal

 jo is baat kaa pramaan tha ki unki bahyamukhi or nijee kshetra ko praathamikta dene vaali aarthik nitiyaan behatar thim
 In such a situation, India had found a good example for adopting economic reforms in 1971 only a decade ago instead of 80s

 jwalamukhi ke visphot ke samay lava, tephra or vibhinn gaisen jwalamukhi se nikalatin hai
 Volcanic experts have described many types of volcanic eruptions
 inkaa namakaran praayah prasiddh jwalamukhiyon ke naam par kiya gaya he jisamen usee prakaar kaa vyavhaar dekhne ko mila tha
 Several types of volcanic eruptions — during which lava, tephra, and mixed gases are expelled from volcanic vents or fissures — have been distinguished by volcanologists
 inhen aksar prasiddh jwalamukhi ke naam par rakhaa jaataa he jahaan us prakaar kaa vyavhaar dekha gaya he
 Some may exhibit only one particular type of eruption during a period of volcanic activity, while others may display all types of complete sequences in an eruptive chain
 teen alag-alag prakaar ke visphot hote hai
 The best observed is magmatic eruption, which involves decompression of the gas within the magma that drives it forward
 Phreatomagmatic visphot ek or prakaar kaa jwalamukheey visphot he, jo megma ke bheetar gas ke sampeedan se prerit he, prakriya ke pratyaksh vipareet megmatic gatividhi ko shakti detaa he
 The third explosive type is fire explosion, which is driven by the overheating of steam through contact with magma; These explosive types often exhibit no magmatic release, due to the current rock grains
 in vyapak paribhaashit visphotak prakaaron ke bheetar kai upaprakaar hai
 The weakest are the Hawaiian and submarine, then the Strombolians, followed by the Vulcanians and the Suresians
 majboot visphotak prakaar pellen visphot hote hai, iske baad plinian visphot hote hai; sabase majboot visphoton ko "ultra-plinian" kaha jaataa he
 Subglacial and phreatic eruptions are defined by their explosive mechanisms, and vary in strength
 visphotak takat kaa ek mahatvapurn upaay jwalamukheey visphotak suchakank he, jo 0 se 8 tak ke aayam paimaane kaa kram hota he jo praayah visphotak prakaaron se sambandhit hota he
 The volcanic eruption index scales from 0 to 8 to measure the strength of the explosive
 iskaa upyog aitihaasik or pragaitihaasik lava pravaah ke prabhaav kaa akalan karne main smithsonian institution ke global jwalamukhi kaarykram dwaara kiya jaataa he
 It operates in a similar way to the Richter scale for earthquakes, with each interval in value increasing tenfold in magnitude
 jwalamukheey visphoton kaa vishaal bahumat 0 or 2 ke bich viiai kaa he
 Magmatic explosions produce juvenile clusters during explosive decompression from gas release
 ve apekshaakrit chote lava se lekar 30 kimi oonche se adhik ultra-plinian visphot, jo ki pompei ko dafnane vaale 79 main mount vesuviyas ke visphot se bada he, ke bich ke aakaar ke ho sakate hai
 Hawaiian eruption is a type of volcanic eruption, named after the Hawaiian volcano with which this explosive name is a type hallmark
 hawaiyan visphot jwalamukheey ghatnaon ke sabase shant prakaar hai, jo kam gasiy saamagree vaale bahut taral padaarth besalt-prakaar vaale lava, ke prabhaavshaalee visphot se visheshit he
 The amount of material ejected from the Hawaiian eruption is less than half that of other volcanic types
 lava kii sthir maatra kaa utpaadan vyapak dhaal vaale va bade jwalamukhi parvat kaa nirmaan karata he
 Explosives do not remain centered on the main peak, as with other volcanic types, and often from fissure vents around the summit and out of the center
 hawaiyan visphot aksar fisher vent ke saath, ek pankti ke rup main shuru hote hai, jise praayah aag ke parde ke naam se jaanate hai
 ye lava kuch vents,chhidron, par kendrit hona shuru ho jate hai
 Mouth gates meanwhile, often take the form of large lava fountains, which can reach heights of hundreds of meters or more
 lava fawwaare se kan aamtaur par jameen par girane se pehle hawa main thanda hote hai, jiske parinamswaroop sindry skoria ke tukdon kaa sanchay hota he; haalanki, jab hawa vishesh rup se visphoton ke saath moti hoti he, to ve aas-paas kii garmi ke kaaran paryaapt tezi se thanda nahin ho sakate hai, or jameen ko abhi bhi garm kar sakate hai, jisase sanchay shanku banataa he
 If explosive rates are high enough, they can also create splatter-fed lava flows
 hawaiyan visphot aksar bahut lambey samay tak rahete hai; kilaua kaa ek sinder shanku puu'oo, 1983 se lagaataar visphot kar rahaa he
 Another Hawaiian volcanic feature is the formation of active lava lakes, currently there are only 6 such lakes in the world, and Kupianaha vent of Kilauea is one of them
 takabeer, vaakyansh allahu akbar kaa arabi naam he, jiskaa hindi anuwaad aam taur par "ishwar sabase mahaan he", yaa "ishwar mahaan he" hota he

 islamic dharmik drushtikon main yah ek naaraa bhi he
 Which means Allah is very big
 naare ke rup main ise "naaraa e takabeer" bhi kaha jaataa he

 Samvat, Indian criterion of time reckoning
 bhartiya samaaj main anek prachlit sanwat hai
 There are mainly two Samvats, the first Vikram Samvat and the second Shak Samvat
 vikram sanwat i
 pus
 58 varsh prarambh hua
 It became popular as a commemoration of the defeat of Saka people, considered foreign at that time, by the collective efforts of Samvat Malavgan under the leadership of Vikram, the son of Gaddabhilla
 jaan padataa he, bhartiya janata ke deshprem or videshiyon ke prati unki bhaavana sadaa jaagrit rakhane ke liye janata ne sadaa se iskaa prayog kiya he kyonki bhartiya samraaton ne apane hi sanwat kaa prayog kiya he
 It is so certain that it was popularized by the Samvat Malavagans according to the sentiments of the people and has been accepted and used by the public since then
 is sanwat ke praarambhik kaal main yah kritasamvat, tadnantar malvasanwat or ant main 'vikram sanwat' rah gaya
 This last name is associated with this era
 shaq sanwat ke vishay main budua kaa mat he ki ise ujjayini ke kshatrap cheshton ne prachlit kiya
 Chandragupta Vikramaditya abolished the Saka states, but his memorial Saka Samvat is still going on in India
 shaq sanwat 78 i
 main prarambh hua
 Vikram Samvat BC Started 57 years
 yah sanwat maalav gana ke samuhik prayatnon dwaara gardbhill ke putr vikram ke netritv main us samay videshi maane janevaale shaq logon kii paraajay ke smarak rup main prachlit hua
 It seems, the public has always used it to keep the patriotism of the Indian public and their feelings towards foreigners, because the Indian emperors have used their own culture
 itnaa nishchit he ki yah sanwat maalav gana dwaara janata kii bhaavana ke anuroop prachlit hua or tabhi se janata dwaara grahya evam prayukt he
 In the early period of this Samvat, it became Krit, later Malava and finally Vikram Samvat

 He used to do all his work by offering it to Lord Shiva
 man, vachan, karm se vah purnatah shivarchan main hi tallin rahata tha
 Due to his devotion to Shiva, a demon named Daruk lived very crudely
 use bhagavan shiv kii yah puja kisi prakaar bhi acchhee nahin lagati thi
 He used to constantly try to ensure that there was an obstacle in the worship of that beloved person
 ek baar supriy nauka par savaar hokar kahin ja rahaa tha
 The evil demon Daruk, seeing this opportune occasion, attacked the boat
 usne nauka main savaar sabhi yatriyon ko pakadakar apni rajdhani main le jaakar kaid kar liya
 According to his routine in the Supriya prison, he started worshiping Lord Shiva
 anya bandi yatriyon ko bhi vah shiv bhakthi kii prerana dene laga
 When Daruk heard this news about his beloved from his servants, he became very angry and came to that prison
 supriy us samay bhagavan shiv ke charnon main dhyaan lagaae hue donon ankhen band kiye baitha tha
 Seeing this pose of that monster, scolding him in a very fierce voice said- 'hey wicked Vaishya! You are closing your eyes and thinking about what disturbance and conspiracy here? ' Even after he said this, the tomb of the divine Shiva devotee Supriya was not broken
 ab to vah daruk rakshas krodh se ekadam pagal ho uthaa
 He immediately ordered his followers to kill Supriya and all the other prisoners
 supriy uske is aadesh se jaraa bhi vichlit or bhaybheet nahin hua
 He started praying to Lord Shiva for the liberation of himself and other prisoners from the concentrated mind
 use yah purna vishwaas tha ki mere aradhy bhagavan shivaji is vipatti se mujhe avashya hi chhutkaaraa dilaayenge
 Hearing his prayers, Lord Shankarji immediately appeared as a Jyotirlinga, situated on a shining throne in a high place in that prison
 unhone is prakaar supriy ko darshan dekar use apana pashupat-astr bhi pradaan kiya
 With this weapon, after killing the demon Daruk and his assistant, Supriya went to Shivdham

 The spread of malaria depends on these factors - the density of the human population, the density of the mosquito population, the spread from mosquitoes to humans and the spread from humans to mosquitoes
 in karkon main se kisi ek ko bhi bahut kam kar diya jaae to us kshetra se malaria ko mitaayaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, to prevent the spread of diseases in malaria affected areas, along with medicines, measures are taken to eradicate mosquitoes or avoid bites
 anek anusandhan karta daawa karte hai ki malaria ke upachaar kii tulana main us se bachaav kaa vyay deergh kaal main kam rahegaa, haalanki vishwa ke kuch sarvaadhik nirdhan deshon main iskaa taatkaalik vyay uthaane kii kshamta bhi nahin he

 Elimination of mosquitoes was a major place in the efforts to eradicate malaria

 Although it was never banned for malaria control, but critics say that millions of lives have died due to unnecessary restrictions
 phir samasya dediti ke krishi kshetra main vyapak prayog se hui thi naa ki iskaa prayog jan swasthy kshetra main karne se
 The World Health Organization has recognized about 12 drugs for spraying in malaria-affected areas
 inamen dediti ke alaava paramathrin or deltamathrin jaisi davaayen shaamil hai, khaskar un kshetron main jahaan machhar dediti ke prati rodhak kshamta viksit kar chuke he
 The Stockholm Convention allows for limited health-related use of DDT, but it is prohibited from being used for open-ended agricultural purposes

 Since the Anopheles mosquito bites at night, the protection is completed by hanging large mosquito nets on the bed / bed and completely encircling the bed
 machhardaniyaan apane aap main bahut prabhavi upaay nahin hai kintu yadi unhen rasinic rup se upachaarit kar den to ve bahut upyogi ho jaati hai
 Mosquitoes die as soon as they come in contact with this chemical
 upachaarit machhardaniyaan anopchaarit machhardaniyon se doguni prabhavi hoti hai or bina machharadaani ke sone ke bajaay unka prayog karne se 70% zyada suraksha milti he
 The distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets is considered to be a very cheap and effective way to control malaria
 a typical mosquito repellent is priced between $ 2
50 to $ 3
50
 prabhavit ilaakon main praayah sanyukt raashtra angesi yaa koi anya sanstha unka vitaran karti he
 For maximum protection, it is necessary to apply the chemical again every six months, but it is often difficult to do so in rural areas
 aajkal naveen praudyogiki se is prakaar kii machharadaani ban rahi he jo paanch varsh tak kitnashi prabhaav rakhti he
 While sleeping inside these mosquito nets, there is protection on the mosquitoes that come in contact with them, they also die instantly, so that other people sleeping around also get some protection
 haal hi ke prayogon se pataa laga he ki bistar par bichhi or odhane vaali chaadaron ko dawaaon se upachaarit karne par bhi machharadaani jitani suraksha mil jaati he
 Many medicines that are commonly used in treatment can also be used for the preventive effect
 nirodhi prabhaav ke liye dawaaon kii maatra upachaar se kam hi hoti he
 But due to their long-term use, there is a loss, so they are rarely used or not available in epidemic areas
 haan yadi aap kisi fever grast kshetra main asthai rup se ja rahe hai to inkaa prayog kar sakate hai
 Quinine has been used for this work for a long time, although nowadays it is used more for treatment
 18veen shatabdi main samuel hanimen ne homeopathy ke siddhant kaa avishkaar kunain ke prabhaav ko dekh kar hi kiya tha
 Now-a-days, drugs called mefloquine, doxycycline, atovaquone and prognil hydrochloride are being used
 dawa chunane se purv kshetra main sakriy paraseete kii dawa ke prati pratirohak kshamta kaa gyaan hona chahie
 The side effects of each drug vary
 ye prayog karte hi prabhaav daalana shuru nahin kar detii he kam se kam 1 -2 saptaah kaa samay leti hai, tathaa inhen malaria-grast kshetra chhod dene kuch samay baad tak lete rahanaa padataa he
 Vaccines are being developed against malaria, although success has not yet been achieved
 pehali baar prayaas 1967 main chuuhe pe kiya gaya tha jise jivit kintu vikiran se upachaarit bijaanuon kaa tikaa diya gaya
 Its success rate was 60%
 uske baad se hi maanvon par aise prayog karne ke prayaas chal rahe hai
 Scientists succeeded in determining if a human being bitten by 1000 radiation-treated infected mosquitoes would develop immunity to malaria forever
 is dharna par vartmaan main kaam chal rahaa he or anek prakaar ke tike pareekshan ke bhinn daur main hai
 Another way of thinking is that the body's immune system somehow started making antibodies against the CSP present on the spore of the malaria parasite
 is soch par ab tak sabase zyada tike bane tathaa parakshit kiye gayi hai
 SPF 66 was the first vaccine to be field tested, it was initially successful but was later found to fail with success rates below 30%
 aaj arties, esees02e tikaa pareekshanon main sabase aage ke str par he
 It is hoped that the complete coding of the genus P
 falciparum will facilitate the development and testing of new drugs and vaccines
 malaria-prabhavit kshetron main malaria ke prati jaagrukta failaane se malaria main 20 pratishat tak kii kami dekhi gai he
 Also, diagnosis and treatment of malaria as soon as possible also reduces its prevalence
 anya prayaason main shaamil he- malaria sambandhi jaankaree ikatthi karke uskaa bade paimaane par vishleshan karnaa or malaria niyantran ke tareeke kitne prabhavi hai isaki jaanch karnaa
 One such analysis found that it is very important to treat people with symptomatic infections, because they contain a lot of malaria
 lahore prastaavna,, san 1940 main akhil bhartiya muslim lig dwaara prastaavit ek aadhikarik rajnatik sankalpana thi jise muslim lig ke 22 se 24 march 1940 main chale teen divasiy lahore satr ke dauraan paarit kiya gaya tha
 The proposal called for "independent princely states" for Muslims, allegedly in the northwestern eastern regions of British India, and to make the provinces included in the said units autonomous and sovereign
 tatpashchaat, yah sankalpana "bharat ke musalamaanon" ke liye pakistan naamak main ek alag swatantra swytt mulk banane kii maang karne main parivartit ho gaya
 Although the name Pakistan had already been proposed by Chaudhary Chaudhary Rahmat Ali, by 1933, Majloom Haq Mohammad Ali Jinnah and other Muslim leaders were firm on the principle of Hindu Muslim unity, but the partition encouragement misconceptions constantly being promoted by the British
 Hindus had aroused a sense of mistrust and hatred towards Muslims
 a sensitive political environment had also promoted the proposal of Pakistan is prastaav kii peshi ke upalaksh main prativarsh 23 march ko pakistan main yom-e-pakistan ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 The historic resolution was passed at the end of the three-day annual meeting of the All India Muslim League at Minto Park, Lahore on 23 March, on the basis of which the Muslim League started the movement for the acquisition of a separate country of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent and After seven years, it was successful in getting its demand passed
 upmahadweep main british raaj dwaara satta janata ko saunpane kii prakriya ke pehle charan main 1936 / 1937 main pehle aam chunaav hue the unamem muslim lig ko buree tarah se haar uthaani padi thi or uske is daawey ko gambhir nicha pahunchi thi ki vah upmahadweep ke musalamaanon ke ekmaatr pratinidhi sabha he
 Therefore, the morale of the Muslim League leadership and workers was shattered and there was a strange sense of helplessness on them
 congress ko madras, you pi, si pi, bihar or urisa main spasht bahumat hasil hui thi, seemaa or bombay main usne duusare dalon ke saath milakar gathbandhan sarkaar kaa gathan kiya tha or sindh or assam main jahaan muslim haaavee the congress ko kaaphi safalataa mili thi
 In Punjab, however, the head of Inam Hussain's uninusset Party and in Bengal Maulvi Kripa Haq's Praja Krishak Party won
 garaz bharat ke 11 praanton main se kisi ek rajya main bhi muslim lig ko satta praapt na ho sakaa
 In these circumstances, the Muslim League, it seemed, is diverging from the political stream of the subcontinent
 is dauraan congress ne jo pehali baar satta ke nashe main kuch zyada hi sir shaar thi, aise upaay kiye jinase musalamaanon ke dilon main bhay or khataron ne janm lenaa shuru kar diya
 As the Congress declared Hindi as the national language, the Gao decay was banned and the Congress tricolor was given the status of the national flag
 is maamle main muslim lig kii satta khone ke saath apane netritv main yah bhaavana paidaa ho rahaa tha ki muslim lig satta se is aadhaar par vanchit kar di gai he ki vah apane aap ko musalamaanon kii pratinidhi sabha kehalaati he
 This was the starting point for the awareness of the spirit of two separate nations led by the Muslim League
 isi dauraan dwitiya vishwa yuddh samarthan ke badale satta kii bharpoor hastantaran ke masale par british raaj or congress ke bich charchaa bhadkaa or congress satta se alag ho gai to muslim lig ke liye kuch daravaaje khulte dikhaai die
 And in this background, this 3-day meeting of All India Muslim League in Lahore started on 22 March
 baithak se 4 din pehle lahore main allamaa purvi ke deen party ne pabandi todate hue ek sainya parade kii thi jise rokane ke liye police ne golibari kii
 Around 35 Deen were killed
 is ghatana kii vajah se lahore main jabardast tanaav tha or punjab main muslim lig kii sahyogi party uninst party satta thi or is baat kaa khatra tha ki deen ke fawda vaahak kaaryakarta, muslim lig kaa yah baithak na hone den yaa is avasar par hangaamaa barapa he
 Incidentally, in view of the seriousness, Muhammad Ali Jinnah addressed the inaugural session in which he said for the first time that the problem in India is not communal, but Ben International means it is a problem of two countries
 unhone kaha ki hinduon or musalamaanon main antar itnaa bada or spasht he ki ek kendriya sarkaar ke tahat unka gathbandhan khataron se bharpoor hoga
 He said that there is only one way in this matter that i have different afflictions
 duusare din inhen padon par 23 march ko is samay ke bengal ke mukhyamantri maulavee krupa haq ne sankalp lahore diya jisamen kaha gaya tha ki is tab tak koi sanvaidhanik yojana na to vyavhaarya hoga or na musalamaanon ko hoga jab tak ek duusare se mili hue bhugolic ikaayiyon alag gaanaa kshetron main parisemen na ho
 The resolution said that in these areas where Muslims have a numerical majority, such as the Northwest and Northeast regions of India, they should be set free by combining them with units that have high autonomy and sovereignty
 maulavee inaam ul dwaara kii peshkash kii is sankalp kaa samarthan upi ke muslim legi netaa choudhary riek lsamaan, punjab moulana jafar ali khan, seemaa se sardaar aurangzeb sindh se sir abdulla haaron or baluchistan se kaaji isa ne kii
 The resolution was passed in the closing session on 23 March
 april san 1941 main madras main muslim lig ke sammelan main sankalp lahore ko party ke samvidhan main shaamil kiya gaya or isi ke aadhaar par pakistan andolan shuru hui
 But even then these areas were not clearly identified, including the demand for separate Muslim states
 pehali baar pakistan kii maang ke liye kshetron kii pahchaan 7 april san 1946 dilli ke teen divasiy sammelan main kii gai jisamen kendriya or prantiy vidhansabhaon ke muslim legi sadasyon ne bhaag liya tha
 At this conference, a resolution was passed to present the demand of the Muslim League to the delegation of the Cabinet Mission coming from Britain, which was drafted by two members of the Executive of the Muslim League, Chaudhary Riksalam and Hassan Isfahani
 is karaadaad main spasht rup se pakistan main shaamil kiye jane vaale kshetron kii pahchaan kii gai thi
 Bengal and Assam in the northeast and Punjab, Seema, Sindh and Balochistan in the northwest
 aashcharya kii baat he ki is sankalp main kashmir kaa koi zikr nahin tha haalanki uttar pashchim main muslim bahul kshetra tha or punjab se judaa hua tha
 It is very important that the two states were completely omitted from the Delhi Convention in this resolution, which was very clear in the resolution Lahore, instead it was demanded as the only state of Pakistan
 shaayad bahut kam logon ko yah pataa he ki sankalp lahore kaa mul masauda us jamaane ke punjab ke uninst mukhyamantri sar sikandar hayaat khan ne taiyaar kiya tha
 The Uniunsat party was integrated into the Muslim League at that time and the head Sikandar Hayat Khan was the President of the Punjab Muslim League
 sir sikandar hayaat khan ne sankalp ke mul masaude main upmahadweep main ek kendriya sarkaar ke aadhaar par lagbhag condereshan prastaavit thi lekin jab masauda muslim lig subject cameti main vichaar kiya gaya to kaayade ajam mohammad ali jinna ne khud is masaude main ekmaatr centre sarkaar kaa ullekh moulik kaat diya
 The head Sikandar Hayat Khan was strongly angry on this and stated clearly in the Punjab Legislative Assembly on 11 March 1941 that his vision of Pakistan was mainly different from the principles of Jinnah Saheb
 unka kahana tha ki vah bharat main ek ore hindu raaj or duusari ore muslim raaj ke aadhaar par vitaran ke sakht khilaaf hai or vah aisi bakaul unke vinaashkari vitaran kaa datakar muqabla karenge
 But this did not happen
 sir sikandar hayaat khan duusare varsh san 1942 main 50 saal kii umr main nidhan ho gaya yun punjab main mohammad ali jinna teevr virodh ke uthte hue hisar se mukti mil gai
 In the Delhi session of 1946, the resolution of Pakistan was presented by Sankalp Hussain Shaheed Sohrawardy and it was praised by the Muslim Legion leader of UP, Chaudhary Riyakalsam
 sankalp lahore pesh karne vaale maulavee krupa haq is sammelan main shariq nahin hue kyonki unhen sun 1941 main muslim lig sekharaj kar diya gaya tha
 At the Delhi conference, Abu Alhashm, the leader of Bengal, strongly opposed this resolution and argued that this resolution is quite different from the Lahore resolution which is part of the constitution of the Muslim League - he said that the resolution was clearly in Lahore in two states There was no option to amend this basic resolution of the Muslim League to the Delhi Convention
 abavaalhashm ke anusaar kaayade ajam ne isi sammelan main or baad main bombay main ek baithak main yah samajhaayaa tha ki is samay ke baad upmahadweep main do alag samvidhan vidhansabhaon ke gathan kii baat ho rahi he to dilli kanvension sankalp main ek rajya kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 But when the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan sets the constitution, it will be the final arbiter of this problem and it will have full authority to decide the formation of two separate states
 lekin pakistan kii samvidhan sabha ne na to kaayade ajam jivan main or na jab san 1956 main desh kaa pehla samvidhan paarit ho rahaa tha upmahadweep main musalamaanon kii do swatantra or swytt rajyon ke sthapana par vichaar kiya
 After 25 years of political upheaval and conflict and the destruction of the Bangladesh war in Sun 1971, but two different afflictions of Muslims emerged in the subcontinent, whose resolution is still safe in the case of Lahore

 a personality disorder is a class of different types of personality and behaviors that the American Psychiatric Association defines as follows, interneshnal statistical clacification of disease and related health problems, ne bhi vyaktitv vikaar ko paribhaashit kiya he
 Published by the World Health Organization

29 vayask vyaktitv or vyavhaar ke vikaar
 Ideally various forms of personality disorder are associated with serious problems in an individual's behavioral tendencies, which usually involve multiple aspects of personality and are almost always largely related to personal and social learning
 iske atirikt kai paristhitiyon main vyaktitv vikaar anamy or vyapak hota he, jo kaaphi had tak aise vyavhaar ke aatm-anurupata ke kaaran hota he or isliye vah vyakti ise uchit samajhataa he
 As a result of this type of behavior, the person concerned acquires a defective skill of discouraging concordance which can lead to personal problems that may cause the person concerned to suffer from excessive anxiety, restlessness and depression
 vyavhaar sambandhi in pravritiyon kii shuruyaat adarsh rup se kishoravastha ke baad ke charnon se vayaskta kii shuruuaat ke bich dekhi ja sakati he or kuch asaamaanya maamalon main yah bachapan main bhi dekhi ja sakati he
 Therefore, it is impossible to diagnose personality disorder before the age of 16 or 17

 It was observed that the experience of officially certified physical abuse played a strong role in the development of antisocial and impulsive behavior
 On the other hand, cases of abuse in the form of neglect that led to childhood pathology experienced partial loosening in adulthood
