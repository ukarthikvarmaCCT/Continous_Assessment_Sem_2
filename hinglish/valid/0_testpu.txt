 Wittgenstein has been a professor at the University of Cambridge
 vitgenshtin ke pita karl ek yahudee the jinhone baad main protestant dharm apana liya tha
 Wittgenstein's greatest contribution is to put language in a philosophical perspective
 aaj koi bhi bhashaa vigyaan main jab darshan kaa ullekh karata he to vitganstin kaa naam swatah samaran hota he
 Wittgenstein's writings have resulted in considerable argumentation, even many times Wittgenstein's work has been called a paradox, but it would be wrong to say that logicians had emphasized logical analysis of language even before Wittgenstein
 vitganstin ke guru bartrand rasal rahe hai kaa tarkshastra ko darshan main uchit sthaan dilaane main baari yogadan he
 Wittgenstein's philosophical life is quite interesting because he has refuted his earlier works in his later works
 apni pehle kii pustakon main vitganstin satya ke liye bhashaa kaa mahatv bataate najar aate hai kintu apni antim pustak "philosophical investigations" main vitganstin ne bhashaa main vyaapt bis kaa vivaran kiya he
 Wittgenstein's conclusion proved to be new and important to the philosophical world
 vitgenstin ne ek prakaar se is vichaar kaa pratipaadan kiya ki bhashaa se satya kaa vivaran nahin balki satya kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 All western philosophy is rooted in language, but language shows us only one form of truth, the truth which we create by our belief or experience
 vitgenstin baar baar ek bhashakreedaa kaa ullekh karte hai, jisamen bhaag lene vaale kisi satya kii abhivyakti ke liye bhashaa kaa nirmaan va upyog karte hai
 Through this play, we tell the difference in the facts and truths related to the Wittgenstein language
 apni nirnaatmak pustak "philosophical investigations" main wo kehete hai ki " adhiktar baar jab ham shabd ke "arth" kii baat karte hai, tab ham keval ek bhashaa main us shabd ke yojan kii baat karte hai "

 # article vakalatname kaa ek namoona neeche diya gaya he- Universal mobile telecommunications system is one of the third generation mobile telecommunications technology, which is also being developed in 4G technology
 yah 3GPP dwaara nirdisht or vaishvik ITU IMT-2000 maanak kaa hissaa he
 The most common form of UMTS uses built-in air interfaces such as W-CDMA but the scope of this mechanism includes TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA
 ek puri network pranali hone ke naate UMTS ke kaaryakshetra main, radio acces network, kor network, saath hi saath USIM card dwaara upyogkartaaon kaa pramanikaran karnaa bhi shaamil hai
 Unlike EDGE and CDMA2000, UMTS requires new cell towers and new frequency allocation
 tathaapi, yah GSM / EDGE ke kaaphi kareeb he kyonki yah GSM se lee gai avadharanaon par aadhaarit he
 Apart from this, most of the UMTS handsets also support GSM, so that 'dual mode' seamless operation is possible
 isliye, UMTS kaa vipanan kabhi kabhi 3GSM ke naam se bhi kiya jaataa he
 The purpose of doing this is to highlight its close relationship with GSM and to differentiate it from competing technologies
 UMTS naam, jo ETSI dwaara rakhaa gaya tha, aamtaur par europe main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Outside Europe, this technique is also known by other names, eg, FOMA or W-CDMA
 vipanan main, yah aksar 3G ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 UMTS supports data transfer rates of up to 21 Mbit / s, using W-CDMA, although users in currently deployed networks, in downlink connections, up to 384 kbit / s for R99 handsets and HSDPA hand sets
 One can expect transfer rates of up to 7
2 Mbit / s
 tab bhi yah, single GSM erar-karected circuit switchd data channel, yaa HSCSD main multiple 9
6 kbit / s channelon ke 9
6 kbit / s se zyada he or yah CDMA2000, PHS yaa WLAN jaisi duusari technologiyon ke saath pratiyogita kii hode main mobile upkarnon par world wide web ke acces or anya data sevaaon kii suvidha pradaan karata he
 2G 3G has leading 2G mobile telephone systems, such as GSM, IS-95, PDC, CDMA PHS and other technologies deployed in different countries
 In the case of GSM, there is a development route for 2G to GPRS also known as 2
5G
 Is known
 GPRS kahin behatar data dar kaa samarthan karata he or yah conection oriented hone ke bajaay packet switchd he
 It is deployed in many places where GSM is used
 E-GPRS, yaa EDGE, GPRS kaa ek or zyada viksit rup he or yah aadhunik koding pranaaliyon par aadhaarit he
 Actual packet data with EDGE can reach rates around 180 kbit / s
 EDGE pranaliyaan aksar "2
75G system" ke naam se sambodhit kii jaati hai
 Since 2006, UMTS networks in many countries have been or are in the process of being upgraded through high-speed downlink packet access - also known as 3
5G
 vartmaan main, HSDPA 21 Mbit / s tak ke dowlink transfar daron ko sakasham banaata he
 Work is also on to improve uplink transfer speed through high-speed uplink packet access
 3GPP long turm evolution pariyojna ke antargat, orthogonal frequency-divijan multiplexing par aadhaarit ek agali peedi ke air interphes kaa prayog kar UMTS ko 4G kii gati - 100 Mbit / s down or 50 Mbit / s ap - pradaan karne kii yojana he
 The first national consumer UMTS network was launched in 2002 with a heavy emphasis on 'telco-provided' mobile applications, such as mobile TV and video calling
 japan or duusare jagah ke anubhavon se pataa laga he ki upyogkarta dwaara video kol kii maang zyada nahin he or telko-pradutt audio / video tatwon kii lokapriyata main ucch gati world wide web ke acces ke prati logon ke zyada jhukaav ke kaaran giravat aa gai he - chaahe yah acces sidhe handset par yaa wi-fi, bluetooth, infrared yaa USB ke jariye computor se sidhe jude rahane kii sthiti main ho
 UMTS combines three separate air interfaces, the GSM mobile application part core and the GSM family of speech codecs
 UMTS kai alag-alag sthaliy air interfaces pradaan karata he jinhen UMTS terrestrial radio acces kehete hai
 All air interface options are part of itu's IMT-2000
 vartmaan main sabase lokapriy cellular mobile telephone sanskaran main W-CDMA kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Please note that the terms W-CDMA, TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA mislead
 jabaki ve sirf ek channel acces vidhi hone kaa abhas karaate hai, ve vastav main puri air interphes maanak ke liye prayukt aam naam hai
 Research on non-terrestrial radio usage networks is currently underway
 W-CDMA, ek jodi 5 mhz channelon ke jariye DS-CDMA channel acces vidhi kaa upyog karata he
 In contrast, the competitive CDMA2000 system uses one or more arbitrary 1
25 mhz channels for each direction of communication
 W-CDMA pranali kii spectrum ke bade hisse ke dwaara upyog ke kaaran vyapak aalochana hui he, jisase un deshon main pariniojan kii prakriya main der hui he jo desh khaskar 3G sevaaon ke liye nai aavritiyon ke aavanton main apekshaakrit dhime rahe hai 
 Frequency bands set by the UMTS standard are: 1885–2025 mhz for mobile-to-base and 2110–2200 mhz

 Already in use
 jabaki UMTS2100 sabase bade paimaane par pariniojit UMTS band he, kuch deshon ke UMTS oparator 850 mhz or / yaa 1900 mhz band kaa upyog karte hai, vishesh rup se america main AT&T mobility, newzealand main telecom XT or australia main telstra dwaara next g network par
 W-CDMA is a part of IMT-2000 as an IMT direct spread
 UMTS-TDD ke air interfaces jo TD-CDMA channel acces takanic kaa prayog karte hai, UTRA-TDD HCR ke rup main manakikrut hai jo spectrum main 5 mhz kii vruddhi kaa upyog karte hai
 Each piece is divided into frames of 10ms consisting of fifteen time slots
 Time slots are allocated according to the percentage fixed for uplink and downlink
 TD-CDMA kaa upyog, multiple transsivars se, yaa un tak, streems ko multiplex karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Unlike W-CDMA, it does not require separate frequency bands for upstream and downstream, making deployment in tight frequency bands possible
 TD-CDMA, IMT CDMA TDD ke rup main IMT2000 kaa hi ek bhaag he
 TD-SCDMA uses the TDMA channel access method with an adaptive synchronous CDMA component on 1
6 mhz slices of the spectrum, allowing deployment even in tighter frequency bands than TDMA
 halaki, china dwaara viksit is maanak ke vikaas kaa mukhya uddeshy tha, gaiyr-chini patentdhariyon ko license shulk adaa karne se bachanaa
anya air interfaces se bhinn, TD-SCDMA shuru se UMTS kaa bhaag nahin tha, balki vinirdesan ke relies 4 main ise joda gaya tha
 Like TD-CDMA, it is known as IMT CDMA TDD within IMT-2000
 UMTS, UMTS terrestrial radio acces network ko bhi nirdisht karata he jo ekaadhik base stesan se bana he jo sambhawatah alag-alag sthaliy air interphes maanakon or frequency bainds kaa prayog karte hai
 UMTS and GSM / EDGE are part of the same core network, making UTRAN an alternate radio access network of GERAN and transparent switching between rans based on coverage and service needs
 is vajah se, UMTS or GSM / EDGE ke radio acces network sanyukt rup se kabhi-kabhi UTRAN / GERAN ke naam se bhi sambodhit kiye jate hai
 UMTS networks are often combined with GSM / EDGE, the latter of which is also a part of the IMT-2000
 RAN kaa UE interfes mukhya rup se RRC, RLC, MAC protocols se bana he
 RRC protocols control connection establishment, measurement, radio carrier services, security and 'handover' decisions
 RLC protocol mukhya rup se teen mods - transperent mod, anekanolej mod, ekanolej mod main banten hai
 The functionality of the AM element corresponds to the TCP operation while the UM operation corresponds to the UDP operation
 TM mod main, ucch paraton ke SDU main kisi header ko jode bagaiyr data ko nichle paraton main bheja jaataa he
 The MAC controls the data on the air interface based on the conformed parameters of the higher layer

'akhandta' or 'sanketakshar' donon srbs ke liye hi prayog kiye jate hai, jabaki data rbs ke liye keval sanketakshar hi prayog kiya jaataa he
 With the Mobile Application Part, UMTS uses the same core network criteria as GSM / EDGE
 yah chhod kar jane vaale GSM operataron ke liye ek saral pravaas kaa vikalp bhi pradaan karata he
 However, the migration path for UMTS is still expensive: while most of the core infrastructure is shared with GSM, the cost of acquiring new spectrum licenses and putting UMTS technology on existing towers is very high
 CN internet, ISDN jaise vibhinn bakabon networkon se joda ja saktaa he
 UMTS consists of the three lowest layers of the OSI model
 network parat main radio risource management protocol bhi shaamil he jo mobile terminlon or nirdhaarit network ke bich vaahak channelon kaa prabandhan karata he, jisamen handovers bhi shaamil hai
 More than 130 licenses have already been awarded to operators around the world
 Specifying the W-CDMA radio access technology, which is based on GSM
 europe main license prakriya 'technolji babal' ke ant main hui or kuch desho main aavanton ke liye banaai gai nilaamee prakriya kaa parinaam yah hua ki 2100 mhz ke moulik licenson ke liye bahut oonche daam adaa kiye gaye, khaskar UK or germany main

8 billian kaa bhugtan kiya, jinamein se do ko aage chalakar unke kharidaaron dwaara batte khate main daal diya gaya or chhod diya gaya
 It has been observed that the nature of these heavy license charges is such that due to this the potential benefits in future - which are expected to come after many years - have to be paid very heavy tax
 jo bhi ho, badi keemton kii adaayagi ke ne kuch europea doorsanchaar operataron ko diwaaliyepan ke kagaar par pahunchaa diya

 Recently, a carrier in Finland has started using 900 mhz UMTS in a shared system with 2G GSM base stations located nearby
 aisi ummid he ki agle 1-3 varshon main europe main yah pravriti or failegi
 The 2100 mhz UMTS spectrum allocated in Europe has previously been used in North America
 1900 mhz range 2G sevaaon ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he or 2100 mhz range kaa upgrah sanchaar ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 However, the managers have freed some of the 2100 mhz range used in 3G, as well as the 1700 mhz range used in the uplink
 uttar america main UMTS oparator, europea style ke 2100 / 1900 mhz pranali ko, maujuuda 1900 mhz band main 2G sevaaon ke saath saajha spectrum ke liye lagu karnaa chaahate hai
 AT&T Wireless began UMTS services in the United States by the end of 2004, rigorously using the existing 1900 mhz spectrum allocated for 2G PCS services
 Cingular acquired AT&T Wireless in 2004 and then started UMTS in select cities in the US
 Cingular changed its name to AT&T and is introducing 850 mhz UMTS networks in some cities to further expand its existing 1900 mhz UMTS network and now offers multiple UMTS 850 / 1900 phones to its customers 
 T-mobile kaa america main UMTS kaa armbh 2100 / 1700 mhz band par dhyaan kendrit karegaa, jabaki canada main UMTS kawarej rogers wireles network ke dwaara 850 mhz band par uplabdh karaayaa ja rahaa he
 In 2008, Australian Telco Telstra replaced nextg, a national 3G network operating in 850 mhz, as the nextg brand, replacing its existing CDMA network
 telstra vartmaan main is network par or 2100 mhz UMTS network par bhi, 3GIS naamak company ke saath sah-swaamitv ke madhyam se UMTS seva pradaan karata he
 3GIS owns and operates these networks
 yah company hachisan 3G australia ke saath bhi sah-swaamitv saajha karata he or yah unke graahakon dwaara upyog kiya jane vaala pramukh network he
 Optus is currently operating 3G networks in the 2100 mhz band in cities and major cities, and in the 900 mhz band in regional areas
 vodaphone bhi 900 mhz band kaa upyog kar 3G network banane ja rahaa he
 The 850 mhz and 900 mhz bands provide greater coverage than the equivalent 1700 / 1900 / 2100 mhz networks and are suited for regional areas where the distance between the subscriber and the base station is greater
 dakshin america main bhi kariers ab 850 mhz network shuru kar rahe hai
 UMTS phones are more portable - they are designed so that roaming can be done easily on other UMTS networks
 u In addition, almost all UMTS phones are UMTS / GSM dual-mode devices, meaning that if a UMTS phone exits the UMTS coverage area during a call, the call is transparently transferred to the available GSM coverage
 roming shulk aamtaur par niyamit shulk se adhik hote hai
 Most UMTS licensees consider ubiquitous, transparent global roaming to be an important issue
 ucch koti intercparability ko sakasham banane ke liye, UMTS phone aamtaur par apane GSM folbach ke alaava kai vibhinn frequensiyon ko saport karte hai
 Different countries support different UMTS frequency bands - Europe initially used 2100 mhz, while most carriers in the US used 850 mhz and 1900 mhz
 T-mobile ne america main ek network shuru kiya he jo 1700 mhz / 2100 mhz par kaam karte hai
 These bands are also being adopted elsewhere in America
 a UMTS phone and network must support the same frequency to work together
 prayog kii jane vaali frequensiyon ke kaaran, sanyukt rajya america ke liye banaae gaye UMTS phone ke shuruaati model sambhawatah duusari jagahon par kaam nahin karenge or yahi baat duusari jagahon ke phonon par bhi lagu hoti he
 There are 11 different frequency 'combinations' in use around the world today - including those frequencies previously dedicated solely to 2G services
 UMTS phone ek universal sabsakribar idantiti modul USIM kaa upyog karte hai or GSM SIM cards ke saath bhi kaam karte hai 
yah pahchaan kaa ek vaishvik maanak he or phone main SIM kii pahchaan or pramann ke liye ek network ko sakasham banaata he
 Roaming agreements between networks enable the process of redirecting calls made to the customer during roaming and determining the services available to the user
 saath hi saath upyogkarta graahak jaankaree or pramanikaran jaankaree ke alaava, phone book main SIM bhandaaran sthaan pradaan karata he
 The handset can store its data on its memory or on a SIM card
 a SIM can be inserted into another UMTS or GSM phone and the phone accepts the user information of the SIM, meaning that it is the SIM that determines the phone number of the phone and billing of calls made from the phone Does
 japan pehla desh tha jisane 3G takanic apanaayi or chunki pehle unhone GSM kaa prayog nahin kiya tha unako apane handset main GSM anukulata ke nirmaan kii jarurat nahin thi
 Their 3G handsets were smaller than those available elsewhere

 NTT docomo or softbank mobile donon, ab maanak UMTS kaa prayog karte hai
 All major 2G phone manufacturers have now become manufacturers of 3G phones
 praarambhik 3G handset or modem sirf unke desh main apekshit frequensiyon par hi kaam kar sakate the, iskaa matlab yah tha ki vah duusare deshon main samaan 3G frequency par hi 'rome' kar sakate the 
adhikansh europea deshon kii tarah canada or USA main bhi lagbhag ek samaan frequenciyaan hai
 The article UMTS Frequency Band is an overview of UMTS network frequencies around the world
 ek cellular router, PCMCIA yaa USB card kaa upyog karke, graahak 3G broadband sevaaon kaa upyog kar sakate hai jiske liye kisi vishesh computer ke chunaav kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Some software is installed automatically from the modem so that in some cases it does not require full knowledge of technology to be online periodically
 Using a phone that supports 3G and Bluetooth 2
0, multiple Bluetooth-enabled laptops can be connected to the Internet
 kuch smartphone, ek mobile WLAN acces bindu ke rup main bhi kaary kar sakate hai
 Often no 3G phone or modem is available to support all 3G frequencies
 haalanki, kai phonon main ek se adhik band hota he jo abhi bhi atyadhik bhraman ko sakasham banaate hai
 For example, a tri-band chipset operating at 850 / 1900 / 2100 mhz, similar to the chipset found on Apple's iphone, allows its use in multi-countries where UMTS-FDD is used
 UMTS kaa mukhya pratispardhi, CDMA2000 hai jise 3GPP2 ke dwaara viksit kiya gaya he
 Unlike UMTS, CDMA2000 is an evolutionary upgrade to cdmaone, an existing 2G standard, and is capable of operating under the same frequency allocation
 isaki or CDMA2000 kii kam-se-kam bandwidth aavashyaktaaen, ise maujuuda spectra main karyanvit hone main or saral bana detii hai
 Not all cases but in some cases, only existing GSM operators have enough spectrum to implement either UMTS and GSM
 udhaaharan ke liye, US D, e or f PCS spectrum blox main, prayek disha main spectrum kii uplabdh raashi 5 mhz hota he
 a standard UMTS system can fill that spectrum
 jahaan CDMA2000 karyanvit he, vahaan yah aamtaur par UMTS ke saath maujuud hota he
 In many markets, however, this case of coexistence is of little relevance as the Legislative Hurdles exist to co-implement two standards in a single licensed slice of the spectrum
 UMTS kaa ek or pratiyogi EDGE he jo 2G GSM pranali kaa ek vikasparak unnayan he jo maujuuda GSM spectrum kaa uttolan karata he
 It is even easier, faster, and cheaper for wireless carriers to "bolt-on" EDGE functionality to deliver their current GSM to support EDGE than almost all brand and new devices have to be installed to deliver UMTS Transmission is done by upgrading hardware
 haalanki, sirf UMTS, EDGE ke rup main 3GPP ke dwaara viksit hona hi ek sachcha pratiyogi nahin he
 Instead, it is used as a temporary solution to roll out the preceding UMTS or as a complement to rural areas
 ise is tathy ke dwaara sahaj bana diya jaataa he ki GSM / EDGE or UMTS vinirdesan sanyukt rup se viksit hote hai or ek hi kor network par nirbhar karte hai jo sidhaa hastantaran sahit dual-mod oparation kii anumati dete hai
 China's TD-SCDMA standard is also often seen as a competitor
 TD-SCDMA ko UMTS' relies 4 main UTRA-TDD 1

 Unlike TD-CDMA, which complements W-CDMA, it is suitable for both micro and macro cells
 haalanki, vikritaon ke samarthan kii kami ise ek vaastavik pratiyogi hone se roak rahaa he
 While DECT is technically capable of competing with UMTS and other cellular networks in densely populated urban areas, it has been implemented only for domestic cordless phones and private residential networks
 in sabhi pratiyogiyon ko ITU dwaara UMTS-FDD ke saath-saath 3G maanakon ke IMT-2000 parivaar ke bhaag ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he
 On the Internet access side, competing systems include wimax and flash-ofdm
 GPRS network se, nimnlikhit network tatwon kaa punahprayog kiya ja saktaa he: With the Global Service of Mobile Communication Radio Network, the following elements cannot be reused ve network main rah sakate hai or dohare network oparation main prayukt ho sakate hai jahaan jahaan 2G or 3G network sah-vidyaman hote hai jabaki network pravaas or nae 3G terminal, network main prayukt hone ke liye uplabdh ho jate hai
 UMTS networks introduce new network elements that function as directed by 3GPP: MSC or SGSN kii kaaryashiltaa UMTS se sambandhit hone par parivartit ho jaataa he
 In GSM systems, MSC handles all circuit switched operations, eg, connecting A- and B-subscribers through the network
 SGSN handles all packet switched operations and transfers all the networks to the network Does
 UMTS main, media getwe donon circuit or packet switchd network main sabhi data ke sthanantaran kaa khyaal rakhata he
 MSC and SGSN control the operations of MGW
 nodes ko msc-sarwar or gsn-sarwar ke rup main punah namit kiya jaataa he
 Some countries, including the United States and Japan, have allocated separate spectrum from ITU recommendations so that the most commonly used standard band is not available for UMTS
 In those countries, interoperation of existing UMTS-2100 equipment Alternative bands are used when stopping and requiring the design and manufacture of separate equipment for use in these markets
 aaj jo GSM900 kaa haal he, maanak UMTS 2100 mhz upkaran in bazaaron main kaam nahin karegaa
haalanki, yah aisa lagata he jaise UMTS, handset band kii anukulata ke muddon se utana peedit nahin he jitna GSM tha kyonki kai UMTS handset UMTS or GSM donon mod main bahu-band hote hai
 Quad band GSM and tri-band UMTS handsets are becoming more common

 Customers noticed that their connections were being cut because delivery was possible in one direction only when the handset switched back to UMTS after placing the phone
 duniya ke adhiktar networkon main yah ab koi mudda nahin rah gaya he
 Compared to GSM, the UMTS network initially required a higher base station density

 This was the case when only the 2100 mhz band was being used, although this no longer happens due to the increased use of low-frequency bands
 2006 ke baad se operataron dwaara nimna-band networkon ke prayog main tezi ai he
 Even with current technologies and low-band UMTS, data on telephones and UMTS is still more powerful than GSM networks
 apple, Inc ne UMTS ke bijli kii khapat ko us kaaran ke rup main uddhrut kiya jisaki vajah se pratham peedi kaa iphone keval EDGE ko samarthan detaa tha
 The release of the iphone shows the talk time in UMTS only when the handset is arranged to use GSM

 Flying bombers near Bombay in the western coast often copulate in September and October and have children by mid-march or April
 charmchatak main par kaa vikaas kaise hua, yah gyaat nahin he
 But fossils reveal that at the time when elephants like five-pointed horses and tapirs were roaming the earth, bats were like bats of today and had the ability to fly

 Unfortunately, the power of flying from fossils to tanners does not appear on the link of origin and development, nor their ancestors are known

 is adhinium ko multah agast 1935 main paarit kiya gaya tha or ise us samay ke adhiniyamit sansad kaa sabase lanbaa adhinium kaha jaataa tha
 Because of its length, the Government of India Act 1935 was divided into two separate Acts in response: bhartiya raajnneetik or sanvaidhanik itihaas par sahitya main sandarbh ko aamtaur par bharat sarkaar 1935 adhinium ko sankshipt rup mana jaataa he, bajaay adhinium ke paath ke rup main mul rup se adhiniyamit karne ke liye The most important aspects of the Act were: haalanki, swaittata kii degree prantiy str kii shuruuaat mahatvapurn simaaon ke adheen tha: prantiy governor mahatvapurn arakshit shaktiyon ko barkaraar rakhaa or british adhikariyon ne bhi ek jimmedaar sarkaar ko nilambit adhikaar banaae rakhaa
 The demand for parts of the Act was to establish the Union of India but never came into operation due to opposition from the rulers of the princely states
 jab adhinium ke tahat pehla chunaav kaa aayojan hua tab adhinium kaa shesh bhaag 1937 main lagu hua
 Since the second half of the nineteenth century, the Indian people have consistently demanded a greater role in the government of their country
 pratham vishwa yuddh ke dauraan british yuddh prayaason ke liye bharatiyon kaa yogadan karne kaa matlab tha ki british raajnneetik pratishthan ke adhik roodhiwaadee tatwon main sanvaidhanik parivartan kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos karnaa or jiske parinamswaroop bharat sarkaar kaa 1919 adhinium
 is adhinium ne sarkaar ke ek nav pranali kii shuruuaat kii jise prantiy "dvishasan", ke rup main janaa jaataa tha, yani, kuch kshetron kii sarkaar ko prantiy vidhayika ke liye jimmedaar mantriyon ke haathon main rakhaa gaya jabaki anya ko british-niyukt prantiy governor ke liye jimmedaar adhikariyon ke haath main banaae rakhaa gaya
 While the Act was a reflection of the demand of Indians to play a larger role in government, it was also a reflection of British fears about what that role might mean in India's system
 dvishasan ke saath prayog asantoshjanak sabit hua
 a particular disappointment for Indian leaders was that in areas where they gained only nominal control, the "main authority" was in the hands of the British bureaucracy
 bharat kii sanvaidhanik vyavasthaaon kii samiksha kaa iraadaa kiya gaya tha or un rajasi rajyon jo ise sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar the
 However, a split between the Congress and the Muslim representatives proved to be the main factor to prevent the settlement as the system had significant knowledge of the Sangh's functioning
 vyavastha ke khilaaf, landan main nai kanjarvative prabhutv rashtriya sarkaar apane swayan ke prastaav ke masauda taiyaar karne ke saath aage aane kaa nirnay liya
 a joint parliamentary selection committee headed by Lord Linlithgow reviewed the White Paper to a great extent
 is white paper ke aadhaar par, bharat sarkaar ke bill kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha
 Committee level and later bigotry was pacified, "security" strengthened and indirect elections for the Central Legislative Assembly were re-organized
 bill ko vidhivat agast 1935 main kanoon main paarit kiya gaya
 One consequence of this process is that, although the Government of India Act of 1935 should have gone a little further to meet Indian demands, both the expansion of the bill and the lack of Indian participation in its draft material meant that India The act proved to be radical for a significant element in Britain, while having the act with the best blunt response
 yadhyapi prastaavna ko shaamil karne ke liye british sansad ke adhiniyamon ke liye yah asaamaanya ho gai, bharat sarkaar ke adhinium 1935 se ek kii kami 1919 ke adhinium ke saath virodhabhas ho gai, jiske chalate bhartiya raajnneetik vikaas ke liye usase sambandhit us adhinium kaa uddeshy ke vyapak darshan ko sthapit kiya
 The Preamble of the Act of 1919 is based on the statement of Edwin Montagu, Minister of India for the House of Commons on 20 August 1917 , which promises:

 Indian demands with existing Dominions such as Canada and Australia now had to achieve constitutional parity in British India, which meant complete autonomy in the British Commonwealth

 This tension between them and the vision within the Indian and the British resulted in the clumsy agreement of the 1935 Act which had no preamble of its own, but the preamble of the 1919 Act replaced it, yet repealed the remnants of that act

 Unlike most modern constitutions, but common with Commonwealth constitutional law of the time, the Act did not incorporate the "bill of rights" within the new system that was intended to be established
 haalanki, bharat sangh ke prastaavit maamle main vahaan adhikaron ke ek set ko shaamil karne main kuch jatiltaayen thim, jaisaa ki nai ikai main nammaatr prabhutv rajasi rajyon shaamil the
 However a different view was considered by some and the draft outline constitution in the Nehru Report incorporated the bill's authority
 1947 main, adhinium main ek apekshaakrit kuch sanshodhano se bharat or pakistan ke antarim karyanvan samvidhan banaaya gaya
 The Act was not only extremely elaborate, but it was surrounded with a 'security standard', designed to enable the British Government to intervene whenever it was needed to maintain British responsibilities and interests

 It would be of great interest to see the development of the creation of a highly specialized government; Certainly, if it operates successfully, the most credit will go to the political ability of Indian leaders who have faced more serious difficulties than colonial politicians who developed a system of self-government that is now Dominion level

 Such thermometers are usually calibrated so that one can easily read the temperature by looking at the level of fluid in the thermometer
 Another type of thermometer is a gas thermometer, which is usually used less frequently, but theoretically has great value
 taapmaana ko maapne ke anya mahatvapurn upkaran nimnlikhit hai: When measuring temperature one must be careful to ensure that the temperature of the measuring instrument is the same as the temperature of the material to be measured

 One day, Escort meets Vanessa Carlisle, who works in a local bar, where the love between the two falls apart

 During the treatment, Wade learns about cancer and is worried about Vanessa because he doesn't want to die like this in front of her
 phir ek gopneey program kii ore se vaid ko bhartee hone kaa nyauta miltaa he, jahaan uske cancer kii rokthaam ke saath use aseem shakti bhi mil sakati thi
 However, Wade initially refuses, then decides to leave Vanessa and agrees to go through the process
 phir labaratari main, vaid kii mulaakaat agex or angel dust se hoti he, jinako dekh vah fouran gusse main aa jaataa he
 Ajax injects a special serum into Wade's body to help him wake up some dormant mutant jeans, similarly he goes through a series of tortures, in the midst of severe fatigue and anger, and with that he keeps on mutating
 , But do not succeed
 vaid ko vahaan agex kaa asal naam, francis friman, hone kaa pataa chalata he, jisaki vajah se vah uski khilli udaata he
 At this result, AJAX opens the wad's bandages and inserts them into the airtight chamber, where by constantly increasing and decreasing the amount of oxygen, the wad reaches the extent of asphyxiation - not even a week later until he gets rid of AJAX The real purpose of this would not have been fulfilled through Vaid: Now he had to become a super slave and sell it to those rich buyers
 vahiin band chambar ke andar bhi, vaid apni teevr pratirohak kshamta se cancer beemaari ko thik kar letaa he par prakriya ke dushprabhav se uske puure sharir par jaale ke nishaan ban padate hai
 He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax, but has to stop when he is told that his ugliness can be repaired
 agex tab vaid ko apni baton main gum kar, use sarie se beendhakar fansaa detaa he or prayogshaala main lagi aag main use marane ko chhod detaa he
 Wade still survives the terrible fire and tries to return to Vanessa, but is determined to stay away from her for fear of being rejected by his ill-fated identity
 apane bharosemand dost vizel se salaah-mashwara karne baad, vaid tay karata he ki vah agex ko khoj nikaalega or usee se apni kurupata thik karaayega
 He prepares his intelligence map, naming "deadpool" for his second identity, and takes shelter in the house of a blind elderly woman named Blind El
 in ghatnaon ke sire se peechha karte hue, vaid expresve se guzarati gadiyon ke kafile main agex ko dundh letaa he
 Then, mutilating several of his operatives, he takes Ajax to the side of the road and threatens to correct his misconduct
 tabhi jald hi uskaa saamana kalosus or negasaanik tinage warheads naam ke eks-main sadasyon se hota he, jinaki koshish vaid ko eks-main main daakhila dilaane kii rahati he
 Taking advantage of his disorientation, AJEX escapes from there
 kalosus hathkadiyaan vaid kii kalaiyon main baandh detaa he or ghasitate hue le jane kii koshish karata he, taaki eks-mainsen vaapis pahunchakar use charles xavier / professor eks ke saamne mukhaatib kar saken
 But Wade absconds, cutting off his own hands
 jahaan raat guzarane ke saath hi uske haath bhi dubaara se ug aate hai
 Ajax also arrives at Wiesel's bar and finds out about Vanessa
 vizel kaal karke vaid ko venesa ke khatre main hone kii khabar detaa he
 Wade reaches a notorious strip club where she works but is hesitated to confront her
 iske nattejey main, agex phir venesa ko aguva kar letaa he
 He and Angel ask Wade to come to the junkyard of the closed Helicarrier to meet Dust again
 vaid ab vaapis kalosus or negasaanik se uski madad kii darkaar karata he, or phir yah teenon cab par savaar us kabadkhane ke yahaan pahonchte hai
 And then Colossus and the Negassenic clash with Angel Dust and his soldiers on the one hand, with Wade fighting the henchmen of Ajax on his way and eventually capturing him
 lekin yaheen par angel dust ke haathon kalosus maat khaataa he, negasaanik usapar hamalaa karti he, par is haadase main unpar lataka helicarier kaa upkaran tabah ho jaataa he
 As he falls the Helicarrier, Callosus picks up the Negassanic and saves Angel Dust as well, during this time Wade also saves Vanessa
 kisi tarah bachate-bachaate agex tab vaid par hamalaa kar daalata he, lekin khud funs jaataa he or aakhri main vah kahata he ki vaid kii vikruti kaa koi ilaaj nahin he
 Despite Callous's objection, Wade kills Ajax with his bare hands
 venesa bhi is baat par vaid ke chale jane kii naaraazgi jataati he, par usase vah tab bhi pyaar karti he
 She kisses Vad and tells him to take her
 aakhri post-credit drishyon main, vaid darshakon se is film ke khatm hone saath isaki aagaamee siquil kii banane kii bhi munaadi karata he
