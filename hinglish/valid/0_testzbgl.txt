 Despite these attempts to be general, the UI was clearly divided between competing companies: as were Crystal or Safire Nokia, Quartz was Ericsson
 2002 ke utraardh main DFRD ko simbian dwaara tyaag diya gaya, 'headleys' vitaran ke paksh main UI vikaas se ek sakriy vaapasi kaa yah ek ansh tha
 Pearl was given to Nokia, Quartz's development was expanded as UIQ Technology AB and work with Japanese companies quickly expanded to the MOAP standard
 sabase pehle 2003 main aayathit
 yah ek mahatvapurn simbian relies he jo UIQ sahit sabhi samakaleen upbhogakarta interpheson ke saath najar ai jaise, shrinkhalaa 80, shrinkhalaa 90, siries 60 or saath hi saath japan main kai FOMA phonon main
 isane Edge samarthan or ipv6 bhi judaa hua he
 Java support was changed from pjava and Java phones to a Java ME based standard
 2003 main das lakh simbian phonon ko Q1 main aayathit kiya gaya or yah 2003 ke utraardh ek lakh prati maah ke dar se badi

 yah karnalein upyogkarta kii ore se kamobesh samaan rup se vyavhaar karte hai, parantu yah aantarik rup se bahut alag hote hai
 Some manufacturers chose the EKA1 to maintain compatibility with older device drivers, while the EKA2 was a real-time kernel
 2003 main 8

 New apis were also included to support CDMA, 3G, two-way data streaming, DVB-H and opengl ES with vector graphics and direct screen learning

1b sanskaran main kramshah EKA1 or EKA2 karnal ke saath uplabdh tha
 The 8
1b version, with no additional security level and eka2's single-chip phone support, was popular among Japanese phone companies who wanted real-time support but did not want to allow the installation of open applications
 2005 main sabase pehla or shaayad sabase prasiddh simbian OS 8

 simbian OS ne aam taur par uchit dwiadhari code susangatta ko banaae rakhaa he
 In theory the OS was BC from ER1-ER5, then 6
0 to 8

 For 9
0, significant changes related to equipment and safety were required, but it must be a single order production
 The shift from requiring armv4 to armv5 does not preclude backward compatibility
 2005 ke armbh main jari

 Basic capabilities are customizable to the user and developers can self-sign them, while more advanced capabilities require authentication and signing through the Symbian Signed program, which is independent of approval for 'test houses' and Uses phone manufacturers
 udhaaharan ke liye, fil riting ek upyogkarta pradaan-yogya kshamta he jabaki multimedia divaais drivers ke abhigam ke liye phone nirmaataa ke anumodan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he

 is peshkash ko adhik behatar tareeke se S60 5waan sanskaran ke rup main janaa jaataa he, kyonki yah OS ke liye sangrahit interphes he
 Symbian Limited announced v9
5 on 26 March 2007 which includes native support and localization services for mobile digital television broadcasts in DVB-H and ISDB-T formats
 june 2008 main simbian foundation kii ghoshnaa kii gai jo 2009 main astitv main aayaa
 The purpose was to publish the source for the entire Symbian platform, which is under the Eclipse Public License approved by OSI- and FSF
 The unveiling of the Symbian platform deemed the Symbian OS standalone product to be inappropriate
 OS ko chalaane vaale 100 millionwein smartphone kaa ladaan 16 navambar 2006 ko kiya gaya
 As of 21 July 2009, 250 million devices running Symbian OS were shipped
 simbian OS vibhinn virason kaa shikaar rahaa he, jinamein se cabir sabase zyada charchit rahaa
 aam taur par inkaa prasar ek phone se duusare phone main bluetooth se hota he
 So far, no one has taken advantage of any flaws in the Symbian OS - instead, everyone asked the user if they would like to install the software, with which they gave some warning that it could not be trusted
 haalanki, is vichaar ke saath ki ausat mobile phone upyogkartaaon ko suraksha ke bare main chintaa nahin kerani chahie, simbian OS 9
x ne ek Unix-style ke kshamta model ko apanaaya 
 saidhantik rup se sthapit software bina digital hastakshar ke hanikaarak nahin he - is prakaar is par nazar rakhi ja sakati he
 Commercial developers who can bear the cost can get their software signed through the Symbian Signed program
 vikasakartaaon ke paas apane program ko swa-hastakshrit karne kaa vikalp bhi hota he
 However, the features available do not include access to Bluetooth, irda, GSM cellid, voice communication, GPS and some others
 kuch operataron ne simbian hastakshrit pramaan patr ke alaava anya sabhi praaanpatr ko niskriy karne kaa vikalp chunaa he
 Some other adverse programs are listed below, but all of them still require user input to run
 OS 9
1 ke baad vaale main shaamil plateform suraksha ko hataane ke liye S60 v3 or v5 upkarnon ko hack kiya ja saktaa he or is prakaar upyogkartaaon ko "ahastakshrit" filon ko sthapit karne kii anumati or purv main talaband system filon ke abhigam kii anumati mil jaati he
 This allows changing the way the operating system works and makes hidden applications etc
 viewable, and since the operating system files have now been opened, it also increases the risk of virus hovering
 simbian kii mul bhashaa C++ he, haalanki yah ek maanak karyanvayan nahin he
 There are several platforms based on Symbian OS that have made available sdks to application developers targeting Symbian OS devices - the main ones being S60 and UIQ
 vyaktigat phone utpaadon, yaa pariwaron main aksar SDK yaa SDK ekstansion hota tha jo nirmaataa kii website se bhi downlod yogya tha
 There should be less diversity among sdks of manufacturers from 2010 onwards, with various UI platforms integrated into the Symbian platform
 SDK main pralekhan shaamil hota he, simbian OS software ke nirmaan ke liye header file or librari fil kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or ek Windows-aadhaarit yantranukari kii 
 simbian OS sanskaran 8 tak, SDK main GCC sankalak kaa ek sanskaran bhi shaamil he, jisaki aavashyaktaa upkaran par kaam karne ke liye software ke nirmaan ke liye hoti he
 Symbian OS 9 and Symbian platforms use a new ABI and require a different compiler - compilers of their choice are available, including a new version of GCC
 durbhaagya se, simbian C++ programing main ek gahari larning karv he, kyonki simbian main vishesh takneekon ke upyog kii aavashyaktaa he jaise vivarnak or safai stack
 anya vaataavaran main karyanvayan ke liye yah apekshaakrit saral prograamon ko bhi kathin bana saktaa he
 Furthermore, it is doubtful that Symbian's techniques, such as memory management paradigms, are actually beneficial
 yah sambhav he ki in takneekon ne, jinhen 1990 ke dashak ke adhik pratibandhit mobile hardware ke liye viksit kiya gaya tha, bas strot code main anaavashyak jatilta kaa kaaran baniin kyonki programmeron ko anuprayog-vishisht suvidhaon ke bajaay nimna-stareey routine par dhyaan kendrit karne kii aavashyaktaa thi
 However, it seems difficult to move towards a more high-level and modern programming paradigm
 simbian C++ programing ko saamaanya rup se IDE se kiya jaataa he
 For previous versions of Symbian OS, the commercial IDE codewire was preferred for Symbian OS
 codewarrior devices were replaced with Carbide
c ++ during 2006, an Eclipse-based IDE developed by Nokia
 Carbide
c ++ is offered in four different versions: Express, Developer, Professional and OEM, in increasing capacity order
 Full-featured software can be created and released by Express Edition, which is free
 UI dizine, krash dibging aadi jaisi suvidhaayen, anya bhugtan yukt sanskaran main uplabdh hai
 Microsoft Visual Studio 2003 and 2005 are also supported through the Carbide
vs plugin
 simbian ke C++ kaa flavor bahut vishesh he
 However, Symbian devices can be programmed using Python, Java ME, Flash Lite, Ruby, 
NET, Web Runtime Widgets and Standard c / c ++
 
 Visual Basic developers can use NS Basic to develop applications for S60 3rd edition and UIQ 3 devices
 ateet main simbian ke liye Visual Basic, VB
NET or c # vikaas, appforge crossfire dwaara sambhav tha, jo Microsoft Visual Studio ke liye ek plagain tha
 appforge ceased operations on 13 March 2007; Oracle purchased the intellectual property, but announced that they had no plans to sell or support former appforge products
 Net60, simbian ke liye ek 
NET compact fremawork, jise redfivelabs dwaara viksit kiya gaya, use ek vanijyik utpaada ke rup main bech diya gaya
 Net60, VB
NET or c # strot code ko ek madhyavarti bhashaa main sankalit kiya jaataa he jise just-in-time sankalak ke prayog se simbian OS ke bheetar kriyanvit kiya jaataa he
 There is also a version of the Borland IDE for Symbian OS
 simbian OS kaa vikaas Linux or Mac OS x par bhi sambhav he, jiske liye samudaay dwaara viksit upkarnon or takneekon kaa upyog hota he, jo aanshik rup se simbian dwaara mahatvapurn upkarnon ke liye strot code jari karne se sakasham hota he
 a plugin that allows Symbian OS applications to be developed in Apple's Xcode IDE for Mac OS x is available
 ek baar viksit hone ke baad, simbian anuprayogon ko graahakon ke mobile phone tak ek rasta khojane kii jarurat hoti he
 They are packaged into an SIS file that can be installed over-the-air via PC Connect, Bluetooth, or even on a memory card
 An alternative is to partner with a phone manufacturer and have the software included on the phone itself
 SIS file routing is more difficult for Symbian OS 9
x, as any application that has capabilities beyond the minimum is required to be signed through the Symbian Signed program
 lekin iske vibhinn tod hai, jo simbian OS 9
x
 main kisi bhi kshamtaaon vaale ahastakshrit program ko sthapit karne kii anumati dete hai
 The introduction of the Symbian Signed system, which requires application developers to pay something to use the smartphone's more attractive features, is making it a more unpopular platform for open source projects, independent developers and small-scale beginners
 
 yah sthiti, upyogkarta interfes system ke vikhandan se or badtar ho gai, jiskaa arth he ki vikasakartaaon ko apane software ke kai asangat sanskarnon ko banane or dekh-bhaal karne kii aavashyaktaa he, agar ve kai upkarnon ko lakshith karnaa chaahate hai jo antarnihit samaan simbian OS sanskaran kaa prayog karata he
 Java ME applications for Symbian OS are being developed using standard techniques and tools such as Sun Java Wireless Toolkit that are packaged as JAR files
 Both CLDC and CDC applications can be built with netbeans
 anya upkarnon main shaamil he superwaba, jise Java kaa istemaal karte hue simbian 7
0 or 7
0s program ke nirmaan ke liye prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Nokia S60i phones can also run Python scripts when the Python interpreter for the S60 is installed, with a specially built API that allows Bluetooth support
 isamen ek sahabhaagi consol bhi he jo upyogkarta ko sidhe phone se pithan script likhane kii anumati detaa he

 Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency
 yah pehali vikendrikrut digital mudra he jiskaa arth he kii yah kisi kendriya bank dwaara nahin sanchalit hoti
 It is designed for payment based on computer networking
 iskaa vikaas satoshi nakaamoto naamak ek abhiyantaa ne kiya he
 This is the pseudonym of Satoshi
 samuhik sanganak jaal par parsparik bhugtan hetu kuta-lekhan dwaara surakshit yah ek naveen mudra he
 This currency created from digital system is kept in digital purse only
 isaki shuruyaat 3 janvari 2009 ko hui thi
 It is the world's first fully open payment system
 duniya bhar main 1 karod se adhik bitcoin hai
 Bitcoin is a virtual currency, virtual means that it has no physical form like other currency, it is a digital currency
 yah ek aisi karency he jisko aap naa to dekh sakate hai or na hi chhu sakate hai
 It is only stored electronically
 agar kisi ke paas bitcoin he to vah aam mudra kii tarah hi saamaan kharid saktaa he
 Currently, Bitcoin is becoming very popular in the world
 iskaa avishkaar satoshi nakaamoto naamak ek abhiyantaa ne 2008 main kiya tha or 2009 main open sorce software ke rup main ise jari kiya gaya tha
 Currently people are trading by buying bitcoins at low prices and selling at high prices
 aam debit / credit card se bhugtan karne main lagbhag do se teen pratishat lenden shulk lagata he, lekin bitcoin main aisa kuch nahin hota he
 There is no extra charge in its transaction, due to this it is also becoming popular
 iske alaava yah surakshit or tej he jisase log bitcoin sweekaar karne ke liye protsaahit ho rahe hai
 Like any other credit card, there is no credit limit in it nor is there any problem of moving with cash
 kharidaar kii pahchaan kaa khulaasa kiye bina puure bitcoin network ke prayek len dein ke bare main pataa kiya ja saktaa he
 It is absolutely safe and super fast and it is effective anywhere in the world and it also has no limits
 aise saikadon hajaaron website company he jo bitakoin ko sweekaar kar rahi hai
 You can also pay for plane tickets, hotel rooms, electronics, cars, coffee and anything else
 har saal duniya main $1 se lekar ek million dollar tak idhar se udhar ho jaataa he
 Anyway, we use bank and many company to take money, all these companies take extra amount to send our money to our people and we have to trust them
 western union, mani gram or un jaisi duusari companiyaan kii madad chahie hoti he magar is suvidha ko praapt karne ke liye koi manjuuri bhi leni nahin padati he
 Even today many people do not have banking facility, but there are more number of people who have cell phone with internet and cannot do business through internet
 lekin ab yah bitcoin kii vajah se aisa kar sakate hai kyonki bitcoin par kisi vyakti vishesh sarkaar yaa company kaa koi swaamitv nahin hota he
 There is no centralized controlling authority on bitcoin currency
 aaj bitcoin kaaphi prasiddh he
 It gets power from thousands of people who have special computers that power the network, secure the exchange on the net and investigate transactions
 ise mining kaha jaataa he
 Mining in common language means that mining by extracting minerals such as gold coal etc
 is a physical form of bitcoin, otherwise its mining cannot be done in the traditional way, making mining of bitumen its mining
 Which is possible only on a computer, that is, how to make bitcoins
 The way to create new bitcoins is called bitcoin mining
 bitcoin mining kaa matlab ek aisi process he jisamen computing power kaa istemaal kar tranjaction tranjaction process kiya jaataa he, network ko surakshit rakhaa jaataa he saath hi network ko synchronise bhi kiya jaataa he yah ek bit computer centre kii tarah he par yah di centrulij system he jisase ki duniya bhar main sthit mineras control karte hai mineras bo hote hai jo mining kaa kaary karte hai arthath jo bitcoin banaate hai akelaa ek insaan mining ko control nahin kar saktaa| bitcoin bitcoin mining kii safalataa kaa tranjaction process karne par jo puraskaar miltaa he vah bitcoin hota he
 Bitcoin Miners requires an electrical hardware for mining or, say, a powerful computer that requires fast processing, in addition, Bitcoin mining software is required
 Minors get a transaction fee if they complete the transaction
 This transaction fee is Bitcoin
 The same happens as a new transaction is confirmed in their block
 a mathematical system has to be included with it to solve that which is very difficult which has to be confirmed you have to do millions of calculations per second only then the transaction will be confirmed
 jaise jaise mineras hamaare is network se judenge to unhen mining karne ke liye rikt blaak khojane kaa tarika or bhi kathin ho jayega | Mining is done only by those who have a computer with special calculations and a reasonable ability to do calculations, failing which the Miners will only spend electricity and waste their time
 bitcoin ke mining kaa pramukh uddesh he bitcoin node ko surakshit bananaa or network ko chhedchhad se dur rakhana| vartmaan main yah sabhi bhautik mudraao se kahi adhik moolyawaan mudra ban chuki he
 a bitcoin address is used for bitcoin transactions
 koi bhi blockchen main apana khata banaakar iske zariye bitcoin kaa len dein kar saktaa he
 The smallest number of bitcoins is called Satoshi
 ek bitcoin main 10 karod satoshi hote hai
 That is, 0
 xxrep 7 0 1 BTC is called a Satoshi

 The first crystallinity refers to the science in which crystals are studied
 eks-kiran ke difrackson dwaara crystalonke adhyayanke pehle crystalonka adhyayan keval unki jyamiti dekhakar kii jaati thi
 But nowadays it is done by defraxing various types of beam
 manibhavigyaan, yaa crystalki vah vidya he, jisamen manibhon yaa crystalon kii akruti, gun or sanrachana kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 'crystal' is derived from the Greek word crustalos
 crustolos kaa mul arth he "him", par yah shabd baad main shail-crystal ke liye, jo quartz kii ek rangahin paardarshak kism he, prayukt kiya jane laga
 In ancient times people believed that it was formed due to freezing of water due to excessive frost
 shanai: shanai: "crystal" shabd kisi bhi aise khanij ke liye prayukt kiya jane laga, jo swabhaav se hi sadhran falkon se ghira hota he
 The term cannot be used for ring gems and other ornaments, because the well-arranged flat panels that appear in them are not made in a natural way, but are artificial
 ye falak katkar polish karne ke baad banaae jate hai
 True crystal panels are formed as a result of natural crystallization, whether the crystallization action is in the crust or in the laboratory
 duusari avasthaa main kistalan ke liye padaarth or vaataavaran to manushya dwaara taiyaar kiya jaataa he, lekin crystal kii vaastavik rachana tathaa uske vishisht falkon kaa vikaas manushya ke hastkshep ke bina hota he
 These panels are formed as a result of a special internal atomic structure
 isi sanrachana par crystal ke bhautik gun nirbhar karte hai
 An artificial gemstone made of glass does not have a regular internal structure, so it is not counted in a crystal despite being externally similar to a crystal
 at:, crystal kii sachhee pahchaan uske anuon ke parmaanuon ke niyamit vinyas dwaara hoti he
 a crystal is an even mass, which is usually solid and is surrounded by smooth flat faces on all four sides, based on specific principles
 iske bhautik gun nishchit rahete hai
 Both its external form and physical properties are the external sign of regular internal structure
 adhiktar khanij, jo upyukt avasthaaon ke antargat banate hai, crystal hote hai
 There are some substances, which we call liquid crystals
 yadhyapi inamen niyamit parmanviya vinyas kaa pramaan miltaa he, tathaapi ye sachche thos nahin he
 On the other hand there are some solid minerals which do not have regular atomic structure
 inhen ravaaheen kehete hai
 Some crystals are very small
 inke falkon kaa vikaas sookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se bhi nahin spasht hota
 These are called deep crystals
 saadhaarant: crystalia shabd kisi bhi aise padaarth ke liye prayukt kiya ja saktaa he jisamen parmaanu ek niyamit rup main vyavasthit rahete hai, lekin crystal shabd unheen crystalia padaarthon ke liye prayog main laayaa jaataa he jo chaaron ore se samtal falkon se ghire hote hai
 The size of the crystal depends on the crystallization time
 crystalan jitna dhire-dhire hoga, crystal utane hi bade banenge
 When the crystogen occurs quickly, the molecules do not have the opportunity to move more towards the growth center
 is kaaran bade-bade crystalon kii rachana nahin ho paati he
 At the same time, the activity of molecules also slows down due to increasing viscosity
 vilyan, galan or vaashpan teenon avasthaaon main crystalan ho saktaa he
 The crystals in a solution are formed by the evaporation of the "solvent", the temperature of the solvent drops, or the pressure decreases
 is prakaar namak ke crystal, sodium chloride ke jaleey vilyan se, teenon main se kisi bhi vidhi se ban sakate hai
 Similarly, crystals can be formed from molten material of the same composition
 jal se him crystal kii rachana tathaa pighale hue megma se aagney shail kii rachana iske saadhaaran udhaaharan hai
 In the previous example, as the liquid magma cools down, it forms communities of the mineral molecules present in it and eventually forms the mineral content of the molten rock
 vaashp se crystal kii rachana apekshaakrit durlabh he
 Examples of this are ice crystals made from atmospheric water vapor and sulfur crystals made from sulfuric vapors emitted from hot water springs belonging to volcanoes
 khanij vigyaan ke adhyayan main crystalki kaa mahatvapurn yoga he
 The minerals found in the crust are usually homogeneous crystalline solids
 inamen adhiktar suviksit crystal kii akritiyaan, jo aantarik anvik sanrachana se sambhddha hai, milti hai
 Among these, gemstones like diamond, red, sapphire, emerald, topaz, amethyst etc
 are particularly notable
 in crystalia khanijon ko, jinamein crystal kii akritiyaan nahin dikhaai detii hai, ghiskar patale tukade nikaale jate hai or unka dhruvan sookshmdarshi ke dwaara pareekshan kiya jaataa he
 This test gives some knowledge of the elements of crystalline symmetry present in those minerals, based on which the intrinsic molecular dislocation of those minerals, on which the shape of the mineral's crystals depends, is also the basis of the physical and optical properties of the mineral
 yah vigyaan thos carbonic tathaa acarbonic yogicon ke adhyayan main samaan rup se upyogi he
 Many of these compounds form crystal shapes, which helps in their identification
 un crystalia padaarthon kaa jinamein aasaani se pahchaan main aanevaali crystal akritiyaan nahin dikhaai deteen, yaa jo crystalakomapi dwaara adhyayan ke liye bahut chote hai, eksre dwaara vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 Thus, photographic models obtained by some methods are interpreted on the basis of internal crystalline symmetry, thereby taking advantage of identifying them
 crystal kisi vishesh laabh praturup kii ikai kii punrariti se bana ek niyamit samudaay he
 Thus, the symmetry of this unit signifies the external symmetry of the crystal of the substance concerned
 crystalan kaa adhyayan dhaatukarm ke liye aprihaary he
 Some metals, such as gold, silver, and copper, obtained as pure elements in the crust, show a crystalline form, but some of the metals, which are extracted from minerals, do not reveal the external shapes of the crystallization method
 in dhaatuon kii aantarik sanrachana or samamiti adhyayan ke liye saranchana chrisalaki kii vidhiyon ko upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 These methods are also being used nowadays in the study of clay minerals, whose presence or absence makes the properties of the soil known to determine whether the clay is useful for making porcelain and porcelain
 ye khanij bahut chote chote kanon se lekar colidi maap ke aakaar main praapt hote hai tathaa teen virgon main vibhajit kiye gaye hai
 X-ray analysis has revealed that these minerals are crystalline
 electron sookshmdarshi ke dwaara, jisamen ek lakh guna aavardhan hota he, inamen se bahut se crystalon kii bahya akritiyaan dekhi gai hai
 Many methods of structure crystals have been successfully used in the study of so-called liquid crystals, such as cholesterol estates, ammonium olite, etc
 in crystalon ko pracheen kaal main nishchit rup se drav mana gaya tha
 But it is only solid in the intermediate state
 inamen dikhaai denevaali drav prakruti, yaa dridhtaa kii kami, crystal ke balon kii kamajori ke kaaran hai, jo itane shaktishaalee nahin hai ki kisi ek nishchit jyamitiya akruti ko banaae rakh saken
 The first significant gift to Krystalki is that of the Danish physician Nicolas Stann
 san 1669 main aapane batalaaya ki ek crystal ke kuch kone sadaa baraabar rahete hai, chaahe falkon ke rup or aakaar main kitna hi antar kyon na ho
 a few years later, Hygenz considered the refraction of calcite by assuming that it was composed of small elliptical particles in a regular order, and based on this, you saw the crystal's shape, cleavage, variation in its hardness, and directions
 Simultaneously explained the double refraction
 18veen shatabdi main crystalki ke kshetra main koi vishesh pragati nahin hui
 Only solvents, which contained solutes, formed crystals by evaporation
 inhen 'kritrim crystal' kaha gaya
 Romé de L'लle studied many natural and artificial crystals with the help of instrument called contact crystal angiometer
 yah yantra unke sahaayak karangyo ne san 1780 main kone maapne ke liye banaaya tha
 On this basis you set up six "primary shapes": cube, even octave, rhombus, parallel hexahedral, octagonal on a rhombus base, and double-pied pyramidal
 anya akritiyon ke liye yah kalpana kii gai he ki ve uparyukt prayek akruti ke kinaaron or ghan konon ke falkon dwaara pratisthaapan se nirmit hui hai
 The first work of Romé de l'ile was published in 1772 AD

 As a result of your work, the rule of stability of the interface angle, whose foundation was laid by the stans 100 years ago, was fully established
 yadhyapi crystalavigyaani crystal kii sambhavya aantarik sanrachana ke vishay main pehle se hi pariklpana kar rahe the, par is sambandh main suvyasthit varnan sabase pehle san 1784 i
 main abi aui ne kiya
 While inspecting the cleavage surfaces associated with the shape of the crystal, you established the idea that a crystal is made up of iterations of the smallest possible molecule unit
 is aadharbhoot ekak kii akruti ko us crystal kii samamiti ke anuroop mana gaya
 On the basis of this unit, crystals of different nature could have been formed, if a few lines were regularly discarded as the selection progressed
 is prakaar ghanakon kii ikai se ek vishamalambaaksh dwadashafalak ban saktaa he, yadi ghan namoonay kaa chayan karte samay kinaaron par ke "ghanakon" ko chhod diya jaay

 purna crystal or uski aadharbhoot ikai ke sambandh ke aadhaar par aui ne "parimey ghaataank" ke niyam ko, jo crystalki kaa sabase mahatvapurn niyam he, sthapit kiya
 The significance of this discovery of Aui can be gauged from the fact that he is called the father of the crystal
 aui ke "parimey ghaataank" ke niyam ke aadhaar par san 1830 main hezel ne yah gyaat kiya ki samtal falkon vaale thos pindon main 32 prakaar kii samamitiyaan sambhav hai
 Your work remained inadvertently for a long time
 swatantra rup se gadolin phon laing bhi usee nishkarsh par pahunche jis par hezel pahunche the or unhone 1870 i
 main is tathy ko purna rup se sthapit kar diya
 The work of the internal structure of the crystal continued to progress after the discovery of Oui, and it is assumed that the structure of large crystals results from the repetition of the molecular unit of the crystal or the space surrounded by crystals of multivariate units
 is kshetra main sibar, dena, brooster, delaphos aadi ke naam ullekhiy he
 However, there was no significant progress regarding the composition and shape of the crystal units
 pichley varshon main bahut se ganitagya or crystalavigyaani un bhinn bhinn vinyason kii khoj main lage rahe jinke dwaara vibhinn samudaayon ke crystal apni ikai koshikaon se bane
 The first work in this direction was that of Frankenheim
 inkaa vishwaas tha ki 15 prakaar ke vibhinn vinyas sambhav hai
 These configurations were of stereoscopic nature
 breves ne frankenhim ke trivimzalkon ke liye pusht pramaan die or yah bhi dikhalaayaa ki un 15 main se do vinyas bilkul samaan hai
 He divided these 14 stereoscopes, which are the foundation of the crystal structure, into seven communities
 brevais ne yah bhi suzav diya ki prayek anu ke gurutvakentre ke chaaron ore parmaanuon kii jyamitiya vyavastha samaan he
 In other words, the environment of each point in Braves' stereoscope is similar to the environment of each other point and is equally oriented
 uparyukt bindu anuon ke gurutv centre kaa dyotak he
 Weiner also established this principle independently
 tulyarup parmaanuon kii vyavastha kii niyamitata ke antargat prayek aisa parmaanu aa jaataa he, jiske chaaron ore duusare parmaanu usee tareeke se vyavasthit hote hai
 In the same year Jordan, by referencing crystals, found out only on the basis of mathematics how possible the regular frequency of the so-called all-encompassing circles is possible
 viner ke siddhant ko maanakar tathaa jordan kii vidhi ko crystal main prayukt kar sohanke ne gyaat kiya ki 65 bindu khaas tareekon se avkaash main vyavasthit ho sakate hai, jabaki keval samaan paryaavaran kii aavashyaktaa he na ki samaan abhivinyas kii, jaisaa ki brevais ke trivimzaal main
 From these 65 Bindu communities, such a structural arrangement was obtained, which not only provided for the full-fledged class of different communities, as was also the case in the Bravais Stereoscopic, but also the symmetry of many classes below it
 trivimdik main paravartan tathaa pratilomon kriyaaon kaa samavesh kar fedorof, shouenflise or barlo ne swatantra rup se tathaa vibhinn tareekon se adhyayan kar 195 sanrachanaatmak anuvinyas vyavasthaayen gyaat kin
 Thus all the points became community or class 230
 ab neeche kii shrenee kii samamiti ko bhi samajhnaa sambhav ho gaya
 The 32 symmetry classes thus established correspond to the 32 classes of crystal symmetry, which are considered in the natural crystal

 These surfaces are called panels
 falak saadhaarant: samtal or chikne hote hai
 Plaques can be of the same type or different types
 yadi sab falak ek tarah ke hote hai tathaa samaan rup se viksit hote hai tab unki jyamitiya akritiyaan samaan hoti hai
 But the shape of these types of faces is different if they are obtained in combination with other types of faces
 ek hi praroop ke sabhi falak ek crystal rup ke sadsy hote hai
 This form is a combination of faces whose presence is necessary for crystal symmetry when one of them is present
 in falkon kii sankhya us crystal samamiti ke upar nirbhar karti he
 The line joining the two appendages is called the core of the crystal
 vah konaa jahaan teen yaa adhik falak milte hai konia, jise bahut se lekhak ghan kone kehete hai, kehalaata he
 In a crystal similar to a polyhedron, the addition of the pane number and the cone number becomes equal to the number of cores and the addition of two
 crystalki main do falkon par khinche gaye antarafalak abhilanbon ke bich ke kone ko ant:falak kone kehete hai
 It is to be kept in mind that this angle is the complement of the actual angle between the faces
 yah vishesh prakaar kaa antarafalak kone, kone maapne kii vidhi ke anuroop he
 It is also compatible with mathematical calculations on the one hand and the stereoscopic representation of the crystal faces on the other side and subsequent spherical trigonometry
 apekshaakrit bade crystalon kaa antarafalak kone maapne ke liye sansparsh crystal konemapi, jise 1870 i
 main karangyo ne banaaya tha, upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 Many panels in the crystal can be arranged such that their surfaces, where the attached pairs meet, are parallel
 aise falkon ke samudaay ko mandal kehete hai
 The imaginary line, which passes through the center of the crystal and which is parallel to the cores, is called the mandrel axis and the plane in which the faces of all the faces of the circle are called mandalasal
 falak ek yaa anek rup ke ho sakate hai
 There are many ways to display crystals on paper
 ek sidhaa or saral tarika crystal ke koron kaa ek vaisaa hi nakshaa kheenchna he, jaisaa ki ve ek bindu se, jo thik unke upar parimit duuri par ho, dikhaai dete hai
 Two identical views can also be displayed, the first as seen from the front and the second as seen from the right
 ye teenon drishy ejineering ke neenv vinyas, saamne kaa utthapan or bagali utthapan ko kramash: nirupit karte hai
 This method of representation is called perpendicular interpolation
 pravanta prakshep main crystal ko ek udagr samtal ke upar prakshepit kiya jaataa he
 In it, the crystal is seen from a point which is 9 ° 28 "at an infinite distance from the surface of the topmost pane, or conia, and 18 ° 26" to the right
 crystalon ke falak, samamiti kii nishchat yojanaon ke anusaar vyavasthit rahete hai
 Some base symbols, called the basic components of symmetry, are studied
 ye avyav nimnlikhit hai : If a symmetric plane is present in the crystal, it divides the crystal into two identical and equal parts in such a way that one part is a reflection of the other
 yadi crystal main ek samamiti aksh he, jo us aksh par crystal ko ghumaane se, ek puure chakra main, crystal kaa ek hi nirdisht rup ek baar se adhik, do, teen, chaar baar dikhalaai padataa he
 In this view, the symmetric axis is called a triangular, triangular, quadrangular, or hexagonal symmetric axis
 uparyukt samamiti akshon ke liye crystal ko kramash: 180 degree, 120 degree, 90 degree or 60 degree ghumana padataa he
 Axial symmetry greater than the hexagonal symmetry axis is not possible in crystals
 or na panchakoniya aksheeya samamiti hi sambhav he
 If a symmetry center is present in the crystal, a conia present in one part of the crystal, a core or contiguous conia of a pane, core or vane is also present in the opposite part of the crystal
 kisi crystal main samamiti avyav or unke gunon ko jaanane ke liye crystal ko samroop falkon ke asmaan vikaas se honevaali aniyamittaaon se, jaisaa ki prakruti main saadhaarant: hota he, mukt kalpit kiya jaataa he
 In the case of geometric symmetry only, the symmetry center or the corner, core or plane in the opposite side of a plane, should be equally spaced
 isamen vipareet falak bhi ek hi aakaar or rup ke hote hai
 In crystal structural symmetry, the symmetry of the interface angle is the determinant component, the expansion and shape of the panels are not important due to natural deformation
 crystal main virupan kaa kaaran vilaayakon kii shuddhta yaa crystal kii vruddhi gati, taap yaa sampeden main pratikulata he
 These facts determine the particular form of the crystal
 crystal kaa vishesh rup upasthit roopon tathaa prayek rup ke falkon ke aapekshik vistaar ke lakshanon ke yoga kaa hi parinaam he
 The term "" special form "" is used, along with the principal facet configurations existing in crystals, or the words used for prismatic and flat forms that result from greater growth in one or two directions in the crystal
 crystal kii samamiti kii visheshtaon ko purna rup se adhyayan karke pracheen kaaryakartaaon ne samamiti kaa niyam banaaya
 This formula or rule is as follows: The faces of a crystal are located according to the definite component of symmetry
 us crystal ke liye falkon kii sthiti nishchat rahati he or isi par uskaa bahyarup tathaa bhautik gun nirbhar karata he
 Earlier activists also found that no matter how different the crystals of a substance show, their corresponding interface is the basic formula for the stability of the angle
 crystalia aksh vah kalpit rekha hai, jo crystal ke centre se hokar jaati he
 These fictitious lines are used as reference axes to indicate the position of the crystal panels
 saadhaarant: ye aksh mukhya samamiti aksh hote hai, yaa kuch koron ke samaantar hote hai
 Depending on the nature of the crystal, three symmetry planes are normal or some or four such axis values of the crystal can be assumed
 yah aavashyak nahin he ki aksh ek duusare ke baraabar hon, yaa doosar par samaan rup se jhuke hon
 The relative lengths of these axes are called 'axial ratio'
 ye adhiktar x, y, z dwaara likhi jaati hai
 It is customary to consider y as the unit
 ve aapekshik dooriyaan jinpar crystal falak ke crystalia akshon ko katate hai unka ant:khandi anupaat kehalaata he
 The pane, which cuts the axes in such a way that the ratio of those distances is proportional to the units of the successive axes, is called the unit pane, or parametric plane
 ekak falak nirdhaaran karne ke liye saadhaarant: sabase adhik milanevaali falak samshti ko hi chun liya jaataa he
 The size, or slope of any pane can be expressed by their unit intercepts
 yadi ek falak teen akshon x, y, z par a, b, c antarkhand katata he, tab unke sambandh ko vaais kii vidhi ke anusaar ax, by, cz dwaara dikhalaayaa ja saktaa he
 The exponential method, first popularized by Miller, is more prevalent in place of Vice's parameter method
 is vidhi ke vyutkramank yaa ghaataank yadi bhinn main hai, to guna kar inako purna sankhya main badalakar prayog kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, if a panel cuts the x axis twice the distance of the unit and y three times the distance, and is parallel to Z, its vice-sign will be 2 x, 3 y, ¥ z
 inke vyutkramank 1 / 2, 1 / 3 1 / ¥ honge
 Multiplying by 6 it will be 3, 2, 0
 at: is falak kaa milarchihr 3, 2, 0 likhaa jayega or yah teen, do, shunya padhaa jayega
 Sometimes it is placed in small brackets, because X-rays in crystals indicate signs without compositions
 majhale koshthak main yah {3 2 0} falak ke puure rup ko batalaata he or bade koshthkon main yah ek mandal ko suchit karata he
 The collation sign is important for all of Krystalki's methods, goniometry reading, three-dimensional interpolation and mathematical calculation
 anubhav se gyaat hua he ki saamanyat: ek crystal main keval ve hi falak rahete hai, jinke aksheeya ant:rkhand ikai ke laghugunit, yaa anant hote hai
 Similarly, Miller exponents are simple rational numbers or zeros
 ise parimey ghaataank niyam kehete hai
 It is not possible to have exponents like 20
5 or 1
327 xxrep 5 
 etc
 bhinn bhinn prakaar ke crystalon ko samajhane ke liye suvidhanusaar crystalia akshon kii bhinn bhinn avasthaaen kalpit kii jaati hai
 They are classified into six crystal communities

 The three axes are oriented in such a way that the so-called l axis remains vertical, r is located in the vertical plane parallel to the observer and the third axis faces the observer
 l, r or ya kaa kramash: upree, daayan tathaa saamne ko sira dhan kehalaata he tathaa inke vipareet sire rin kehalaate hai
 If the minus of an axis is interpolated by a pane, then the minus sign is made above the corresponding exponential
 trinataksh samudaay main teenon aksh ya, r l asmaan lambaaiyon ke hote hai tathaa ek duusare par tiryak kone banaate hue jhuke rahete hai
 Y, R, l are unequal in Ekataksha community
 ya or l ek duusare par tiryak kone banaate hai, par r us samtal par, jisamen ya or l hai, lambavat sthit rahata he
 In the Vishalambaksha community, y and r are unequal, but are equally inclined to each other

 In the quadrilateral community, two equal horizontal axes Y1 and Y2 form right angles to each other and the vertical axis is unequal
 trisamalambaaksh samudaay ke teen aksh samaan hai or ek duusare par samakon banaate hai
 Y1, Y2 are horizontal and Y3 is vertical

 In fact, some of these are complete or full-scale forms, in which all the planes required for the full symmetry of that community exist
 inamen kuch rup aanshik hote hai, jaise ardhafalakeey or chaturthanshfalakeey akritiyaan
 In half-surface shapes, half the faces of the complete community shapes of the same community and one-fourth of the quadrilateral figures are present
 iske atirikt bhi ek or aanshik rup hota he, jise ardhakriti rup kehete hai
 In this, half of the planar crystals are centered on, or are formed on only one side of the crystal, the remaining half is either absent, or the other half is represented there
 kisi bhi samudaay se sambhddha, ye aanshik rup us samudaay ke purnafalkeey rup kii apeksha nimna shrenee kii samamiti ke hote hai
 Hence crystals of any community fall under different symmetry classes
 samamiti virgon kaa namakaran us varg ke sabase adhik saadhaaran rup ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 In principle considering all possible combinations of symmetry, 32 classes of symmetry have been determined
 saadhaarant: inamen se keval 11 hi khanijon main milte hai, anya 13 khajinon tathaa kritrim crystalon main durlabhta se milte hai or anya 6 to keval kritrim crystalon main hi milte hai
 The remaining two more are still unformed

 Crystals are generally not visible in nature and they are easy to make in the laboratory
 adhiktar ve samucchy main milte hai, jo samaangi hote hai, yaa vishmangi hote hai, jisamen bhinn bhinn crystalon kaa yoga bhinn bhinn hota he
 Parallel aggregates often show parallel growth of crystals, such as in alum, copper, hematite and snow
 kabhi kabhi samaantaran aanshik hota he, jaise ki yamal crystalon main
 In many cases, there is absolutely no change
 inamen crystalia ikaiyaan avyavasthit rup se judi rahati hai or is prakaar ek "aniyamit samucchy" kii rachana hoti he
 Similarly, "heterogeneous aggregates" may also have almost complete alteration, such as a natural growth mantle or partial alteration, or a complete absence of alteration
 yamal crystal main do yaa adhik crystal is prakaar aakaar main jude rahete hai ki ek bhaag sanlagn bhaag ke paravartan se bana dikhalaai padataa he
 It appears that a part of the Yamal crystal has rotated 180 degrees above its axis from its original position
 upar kathith paravartan samtal yamal crystal ke donon bhaagon se samaan rup se sambandhit rahata he, par yah samtal un donon bhaagon main se kisi kaa bhi samamiti samtal nahin hota he
 This hypothetical plane is called the Yamal plane and the axis Yamal axis
 yah donon ek duusare par samakon banaate hai
 The plane where the two enclosed parts meet together is called the fusion plane
 adhiktar dashaon main yah yamal samtal hi hota he
 Contact roots have a clear embankment plane, such as in the arthrocyl spinel and caseite

 Under this, multicellular Yamal and cyclic pair
 bahusanshleshi yamal main kramagat sanmilan tal samaantar hote hai, jaise elbite main, tathaa chakree yugma main ye tal samaantar nahin hote, jaise rutile main
 Crystals of low-grade symmetry are sometimes simulated by crystals of relatively high-grade symmetry through cyclic Yamal
 crystalon main yamalan kaa kaaran anuon main purna samaantaran kii kami maani jaati he, jo crystalan ke prakram main anublon ko yathochit samay na milane ke kaaran hoti he
 In cyclic Yamals, there seems to be an unsuccessful attempt to obtain high symmetry of the Yamalan crystals
 crystal kii aantarik anuvyavastha par keval uskaa bahya rup hi nahin varan uske bhautik gun bhi nirbhar karte hai
 Some of these properties are known by the resistance of the crystal when it is broken, scratched or bent
 crystal ke anya gun prakaash or ooshmaa tathaa chumbak or vidyudbalon se sambhddha he
 Crystals of galena, pyrite, calcite, and many other minerals break off on certain flat surfaces, which are parallel to the potential plane or sides of the crystal
 is gun ko vidalan kehete hai
 This shows that the sensory forces are weaker in some directions than in other directions
 crystalon, jinamein vidalan sataha nahin vidyaman hoti, vibhang hota he
 It is a fractured cone, that is, smooth and concave when the surface is broken, or may be Assam

 The softest crystal is of talc and the hardest is of diamond
 maapak main 9 tak lagbhag samaan antaraal he
 The diamond, which has a relatively hardness of 10 on this scale, is 42
4 by absolute measure
 at: 9 or 10 ke bich main apekshaakrit bahut adhik antaraal he
 In some crystals the hardness varies along the directions

 suprasiddh sahitya darpan main kaha gaya he hriday kaa sthaayee bhav, jab vibhaav, anubhav or sanchari bhav kaa sanyog praapt kar letaa he to ras rup main nishpann ho jaataa he
 Dev, the chief poet of Reetikal, has defined rasa in these words: is prakaar ras ke chaar ang hai - sthaayee bhav, vibhaav, anubhav or sanchari bhav
 Bhava means: -hona sahruday ke ant:karan main jo manovikar vaasana yaa sanskaar rup main sadaa vidyaman rahete hai tathaa jinhen koi bhi virdohi yaa avirohi dabaa nahin saktaa, unhen sthaayee bhav kehete hai
 They reside in the human mind in seed form, stagnant for a long time
 ye sanskaar yaa bhaavana ke dyotak hai
 They are hidden in humans in the same way as the smell in the soil is absorbed in a different way
 ye itane samarth hote hai ki anya bhaavon ko apane main villin kar lete hai
 Their number is 11 - Rati, Haas, mourning, ecstasy, anger, fear, jugupsa, amazement, Nirveda, Vatsalata and love for God
 vibhaav kaa arth he kaaran
 They affect / express the permanent expressions, making them tasty
 ye ras kii utpatti main aadharbhoot maane jate hai
 There are two differences of influence: bhaavon kaa udgam jis mukhya bhav yaa vastu ke kaaran ho vah kavy kaa alamban kaha jaataa he
 Subjects and shelter come under suspension
 jis paatr ke prati kisi paatr ke bhav jaagrit hote hai vah vishay he
 In literature, this topic is called Alamban Vibhava or 'alamban'
 jis paatr main bhav jaagrit hote hai vah aashray kehalaata he
 The causal factor in keeping the permanent feeling awake is called stimulation effect
 udhaaharan swaroop vir ras ke sthaayee bhav utsaah ke liye saamne khadaa hua shatru alamban vibhaav he
 The army with the enemy, the instruments of war and the enemy's robes, roar-lines, arms operations, etc
 are the stimulus effects
 uddipan vibhaav ke do prakaar maane gayi hai: Meaning the powers and gestures of standing arthath vaataavaran se sambandhit vasteen
 Natural scenes are also counted under these
 rati, haas, shok aadi sthaayee bhaavon ko prakashit yaa vyakt karne vaali aashray kii cheshtaaen anubhav kehalaati hai
 These gestures originate in the shelter after emotional awakening, hence they are called Anubhav, that is, one who follows the emotion is called Anubhav
 anubhav ke do bhed hai - icchit or anichhit
 The actions which occur in the ordinary folk publishing the emotions, generated by their own causes through dedication and stimulation, are called poetic dramas etc
 udhaaharan swaroop virah-vyakul nayak dwaara sisakiyaan bharna, milan ke bhaavon main ashru, swead, romaanch, anuraag sahit dekhnaa, krodh jaagrit hone par shastr sanchaalan, kathor vaani, ankhon kaa laal ho janaa aadi anubhav kahe jaaenge
 Simple experience: There are four distinctions
 1
angik 2
vaachik 3
 aharya 4
 satvik
 The physiological efforts of the asylum are asexual or somatic
 rati bhav ke jaagrath hone par bhu-vikshep, kataaksh aadi praytn purvak kiye gayi vagvyapaar vaachik anubhav hai
 Superimposed or artificial dress design is dietary experience
 parantu, sthaayee bhav ke jaagrath hone par swaabhaavik, akrutrim, aytnaj, angavikar ko satvik anubhav kehete hai
 For this, the shelter does not have to make any external efforts
 isliye ye aytnaj kahe jate hai
 They are self-generating and cannot be stopped
 satvik anubhav : arthath aath bhed hai - stambh, swead, romaanch, swarbhang, vepathu, vaivarny, ashru or pralay
 Those expressions which come in a helpful form only to confirm the permanent feeling for a short time and immediately disappear, are communicable
 sanchari shabd kaa arth he, saath-saath chalanaa arthath sancharanshil hona, sanchari bhav sthaayee bhav ke saath sancharit hote hai, inamen itnaa sarmathy hota he ki ye prayek sthaayee bhav ke saath uske anukool banakar chal sakate hai
 Therefore they are also called adulterous expressions
 sanchari yaa vyabhichaari bhaavon kii sankhya 33 maani gayi he - nirved, glani, shankaa, asuya, mad, shram, aalasy, deenta, chintaa, moh, smriti, dhruthi, vrida, chapalya, harsh, aaveg, jadta, garv, vishaad, autsukya, nidra, apsmaar, swapn, prabodh, amarsh, avhittha, ugrata, mati, vyaadhi, unmaad, maran, traas or vitark
 Bharatamuni, while revealing rasa as an essential element of poetry, has clearly mentioned its eight distinctions under the names Shringar, Humor, Raudra, Karun, Veer, Kavach, Bibhatsa and Bhavya and based on certain lines, scholars imagine that He has also approved the ninth juice called Shanta
 inhen nau rason kii sangya he navras
 These juices result from the coincidence of vibrancy-communicable
 prayek ras kaa sthayibhav alag-alag nishchit he
 The Nirvighna-prati-adhyabha stage which is fulfilled by its Vibhavadi coincidence is called Rasa
 shringaar kaa sthaayee rati, hasya kaa haas, raudra kaa krodh, karun kaa shok, vir kaa utsaah, adbhut kaa vismay, bibhats kaa jugupsa, bhayanak kaa bhay tathaa shant kaa sthaayee sham yaa nirved kehalaata he
 Bharata has considered Vishnu, Pramatha, Rudra, Yamraj, Indra, Brahma, Mahakal and Kaldev, the deities of the eight Rasas respectively
 shant ras ke devtaa narayan or uskaa varna kundetu bataaya jaataa he
 The first eight rasas are considered as Shyam, Sit, Rakht, Kapot, Gaur, Peet, Neel and Krishna Varna respectively
 bharat ne pratham aath rason main shringaar, raudra, vir tathaa vibhats ko pradhan maanakar kramash: hasya, karun, adbhut tathaa bhayanak ras kii utpatti maani he
 The humor of Shringar arises as a result of humor, raudra and heroic deeds resulting from compassion and the amazing and gruesome philosophy
 anukriti kaa arth, abhinavgupt ke shabdon main abhas he, at: kisi bhi ras kaa abhas hasya kaa utpaadak ho saktaa he
 Deformed prostitutes are also funny
 raudra kaa kaary vinaash hota he, at: usase karun kii tathaa virkarm kaa karta praaia: ashakya kaaryon ko bhi karte dekha jaataa he, at: usase adbhut kii utpatti swaabhaavik lagati he
 Similarly, the origin of the terrible is also possible from Bibhatsadarshan
 akele smashanadi kaa darshan bhayotpadak hota he
 However, this genesis theory cannot be said to be absolute, because the raksha or heroic rasa of the altar can also create the terrible for the spontaneous, and the origin of calm is also possible from the horrors
 raudra se bhayanak, shringaar se adbhut or vir tathaa bhayanak se karun kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 In fact the opinion of Bharata is not clear
 unke pashchaat dhananjay ne chitt kii vikaas, vistaar, vikshobh tathaa vikshep naamak chaar avasthaaen maanakar shringaar tathaa hasya ko vikaas, vir tathaa adbhut ko vistaar, bibhats tathaa bhayanak ko vikshobh or raudra tathaa karun ko vikshepavastha se sambandhit mana he
 But the scholars who believe only three states, called Druti, Vistara and Vikas, will not be solved by this classification
 isi prakaar yadi shringaar main chitt kii dravit sthiti, hasya tathaa adbhut main uskaa vistaar, vir tathaa raudra main uski dipti tathaa bibhats or bhayanak main uskaa sankoch maan len to bhi bharat kaa kram thik nahin baithta
 The presence of one situation with another is also not impossible
 adbhut or vir main vistaar ke saath dipti tathaa karun main druti or sankoch donon hai
 Nevertheless, there is so much indication from the establishment of a Bharathakrita relation that there is mutual reciprocity in the said rasas and they are friends and associates of each other
 mitrataa ke samaan hi in rason kii prayogsthiti ke anusaar inke virodh kii kalpana bhi kii gai he
 Which other juices, along with which other juices will be immediately hindered in taste, this opposition is based on this idea
 karun, bibhats, raudra, vir or bhayanak se shringaar kaa; bhayanak or karun se hasya kaa; hasya or shringaar se karun kaa; hasya, shringaar or bhayanak se raudra kaa; shringaar, vir, raudra, hasya or shaat se bhayanak kaa; bhayanak or shant se vir kaa; vir, shringaar, raudra, hasya or bhayanak se shant kaa virodh mana jaataa he
 This protest is present due to shelter, communion, communion or continuity
 prabandh kavy main hi is virodh kii sambhaavna rahati he
 In Muktak, there is no fear of ending with the verses of the subject
 lekhak ko virdohi rason kaa aashray tathaa alambanon ko pruthak-pruthak rakhkar athwa do virdohi rason ke bich donon ke mitra ras ko upasthit karke yaa pradhan ras kii apeksha angaras kaa sancharivat upasthit karke is virodh se utpann aswaad-vyaghaat ko upasthit hone se bachaa lenaa chahie
 Considering the deliciousness of the juice, it is said to be Brahmananda sibling, Swaprakasananda, eccentric etc
 and on this basis all the juices are considered to be enjoyable
 bhattnayak ne satvodrake ke kaaran mamatv-paratv-hin dasha, abhinavgupt ne nirvighn pratiti tathaa aanandavardhan ne karun main maadhurya tathaa ardrata kii avasthit bataate hue shringaar, vipralambh tathaa karun ko uttarottar prakarshamay bataakar sabhi rason kii anandswarupata kii ore hi sanket kiya he
 But by considering the sentiments based on favorable sentimentality and unfavorable sentimentality, Rudrabhatta Ramchandra Gunachandra, Haripal, and Dhananjaya and Acharya Ramchandra Shukla in Hindi have considered the juxtaposition of the rashas and the sadistic sensations
 abhinavgupt ne in sabase pehle hi "abhinavbharti" main "sukhdu:khaswabhaavon ras:" siddhanth ko prastut kar diya tha
 In the rhetorical rasas, sringar, valor, humor, wonderful and quiet, and in sadistic karuna, raudra, bebhatas and terrible were counted
 "pankaras" kaa udhaaharan dekar jaise yah siddh kiya gaya ki gud mirich aadi ko mishrit karke banaae janevaale panak ras main alag-alag vastuon kaa khatta meethaapan na maaloom hokar ek vicitra prakaar kaa aswaad miltaa he, usee prakaar yah bhi kaha gaya ki us vaichitrya main bhi anupatik dhang se kabhi khatta, kabhi tikt or isi prakaar anya prakaar kaa swaad aa hi jaataa he
 Madhusudan Saraswati's statement is that even after considering sattva as prime, rather than raja or tam, it should be accepted that partly they also remain tasteful
 acharya shukla kaa mat he ki hamen anubhuti to varnit bhav kii hi hoti he or bhav sukhaatmak du:khaatmak aadi prakaar ke hai, atev ras bhi donon prakaar kaa hoga
 On the other hand, to treat the juices as blissful, consider it to be a pity for the biased gentlemen and take the support of the argument that even if the sorrowful object is dear, it seems to be pleasurable
 jaise, ratikeli ke samay stri kaa nakhkshatadi se yon to sharir pidaa hi anubhav hoti he, kintu us samay vah use sukh hi maanati he
 In addition to this notion of Bhoja and Vishwanath, Madhusudan Saraswati himself supports his blissfulness by considering the rasas as distinct and unique from the sensation of cosmic emotions, and Abhinavagupta explains this notion that we experience the same feeling without being distracted and If it is done without external or intrinsic interference, then it is called joyful because it is tolerable
 yadi du:khaatmak hi maane to phir shringaar ke vipralambh bhed ko bhi du:khaatmak hi maane to phir shringaar ke vipralambh bhed ko bhi du:khaatmak hi kyon na mana jaae? is prakaar ke anek tark dekar rason kii aanandarupata siddh kii jaati he
 The pleasure of trajedi in English has also been resolved in many ways and Marathi writers have also presented quite different perceptions regarding the beauty of juices
 praaia: rason ke vibhinn naamon kii oupaadhik yaa aupchaarik satta maanakar parmaarthik rup main ras ko ek hi maanane kii dharna prachlit rahi he
 Bharata has used the word "rasa" in a line in the line "na Hhi Rasadruta Kashchidapyartha: Pravartat" and Abhinavagupta has expressed the above notion
 bhoj ne shringaar ko hi ekmaatr ras maanakar uski sarvathaev bhinn vyakhya kii he, vishwanath kii anusaar narayan pandit chamatkaarakari adbhut ko hi ekmaatr ras maanate hai, kyonki chamatkaar hi rasaroop hota he
 Bhavabhuti considers Karun to be the only rasa and explains the origin of all from him, and on the basis of the statement of "swayam swayam nimittamasadya shantadbhava: enlightenment, re-creation of peace," - calm can be considered as the only juice
 isi prakaar utsaah tathaa vismay kii sarvarasasanchari sthiti ke aadhaar par unhen bhi anya sab rason ke mul main mana ja saktaa he
 Rasa is just a monolithic feeling in the form of taste and pleasure, it is one side and other juices have emerged from the same rasa, it is the other side
 rasapraadhanya ke vichaar main rasarajata kii samasya utpann kii he
 Bharata considers all Shuchi, Ujwal, Medhya and Dalani as adorners, "agnipuran" considers the dressing as the only rasa and distinguishes it from others, Bhoja considers the Shringar as the original and only rasa, but on the basis of the available written evidence " The use of the word "rasaraja" appears only for Bhaktiras in "ujjwalanilamani"
 hindi main keshavadas shringaar ko rasanayak or dev kavi sab rason kaa mul maanate hai
 The use of the noun "rasaraja" is used only by Matiram
 duusari ore banarsidas "samaysar" naatak main "navamon saant rasni ko nayak" kii ghoshnaa karte hai
 Acceptance of rajrajata is dependent on comprehensiveness, fervent taste, ability to penetrate other juices, the power to embody all sancharis and satvikas
 ye sabhi baaten jitani adhik or prabal shringaar main pai jaati hai, utani anya rason main nahin
 Therefore, Rasraj is called the same
 raso kaa raja shringaar ras ko mana jaataa he Thinkers have also described the remaining rasas except for Raudra and Karun
 inamen sabase vistrut varnan shringaar kaa hi thahartaa he
 Shringar is mainly divided into two parts in the name of conjugation and vipralambha or disconnection, but some scholars like Dhananjaya etc
 consider the antecedent distinction of Vipralambha as a coincidence-antagonistic-non-preceding condition and the two distinctions from the name of the rest of abuse and intercourse
 And do

 The antithesis of "poetry poetry" is new and the shapahutak distinction can only be accepted as a form of migration, "sahityadarpan" envisages the Karuna Vipralambha

 In "alankarakoustubh", the soon-to-be-destroyed and not-so-beautiful raga is called the fourth by the name "haridra", which his commentator also calls "shyamarag"
 purvanurag kaa dash kaamadshaayen - abhilash, chintaa, anusmriti, gunakirthan, udvaig, vilaap, vyaadhi, jadta tathaa maran - maani gai hai, jinke sthaan par kahin apane tathaa kahin duusare ke mat ke rup main vishnudharmotarpurana, dasharupak kii avlok tikaa, sahityadarpan, prataparudriya tathaa saraswatikanthabharan tathaa kavyadarpan main kinchit parivartan ke saath chakshupriti, man:sang, samaran, nidrabhang, tanuta, vyavriti, lajjanaash, unmaad, muchrcha tathaa maran kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 By adding Sharadatanaya, desire and yearning, and Vidyanatha, his number is considered 12 by bringing resolution in place of remembrance and increasing delirium and beauty

 There are two types in the name of mana-vipralambha pranay and jealousy and three types in the name of small, medium and guru, in consideration of stability of mana and severity of crime, three types in the name of vivaripalambha karyaja, shapaj, sambhramaja and the popularization of work or The future Gachpatravas or present and Gatpravas or the future Gachpatravas or the present and the Gatpravas or the Gharpravas, the tadrupas and forms of Shapaj, and a variety of reasons Nbramj of violence, weather, divine, man, and Prckradi distinction is

 Nayikalankar, Ritu and Prakriti are also described under Shringar Rasa
 ek udhaaharan he- Similarly, the example of Shringar Rasa divided into two parts by the name of Sanyog and Vipralambha or Vioga- hasyaras ke vibhavbhed se aatmasth tathaa parastha evam hasya ke vikasvichaar se smit, hasith, vihasit, upahasit, apasit tathaa atihasit bhed karke unke bhi uttam, madhyam tathaa adham prakruti bhed se teen bhed karte hue unke antargat purvokt kramash: do-do bhedon ko rakhaa gaya he
 In Hindi, Keshavdas and a few other writers have made only four distinctions namely Mandhas, Kalhas, Atihas and Parihas angreji ke aadhaar par hasya ke anya anek naam bhi prachlit ho gaye hai
 Examples - nayaa udhaaharan- There is no difference of quiet
 keval rudrabhatt ne avashya vairaygy, doshanigrah, santosh tathaa tatvasaakshaatkaar naam se iske chaar bhed die hai jo saadhan maatr ke naam he or inaki sankhya badhaai bhi ja sakati he
 Examples - bharatmuni ke ‘naatyashaastra’ main pratipaadit aath natyarason main shringaar or hasya ke anantar tathaa raudra se purv karun ras kii gananaa kii gai 
 'raudratu Karuno Rasa:' Saying 'karun Rasa' has its origin from 'raudra Rasa' and its origin is Shapajyaan Clash Vinipat, ishitjan-viprayag, Vibhava Nash, Slaughter, Bandhan, Vidarva means Exodus, Abuse, Addiction ie Objection etc
 Is accepted by chance
 saath hi nirved, glani, chintaa, autsukya, aaveg, moh, shram, bhay, vishaad, dainya, vyaadhi, jadta, unmaad, apsmaar, traas, aalasy, maran, stambh, vepathu, vevarnya, ashru, swarbhed aadi kii vyabhichaari yaa sanchari bhav ke rup main pariganit kiya he
 Examples - kavyagat rason main raudra ras kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 Bharata has considered these four rasas as 'shringar, Raudra, Veer and Vibhatas in the Natyasastra', so he has given the origin of other juices from them, namely- 'teshamutpattihetavchchatvaro Rasa: Shringaro Roudro Viro Vibhats Iti'
 raudra se karun ras kii utpatti bataate hue bharat kehete hai ki ‘raudrasyaev c yatkarm sa shey: karuno ras:’
 The deeds of raudra rasa are the father of compassion
 raudra ras kaa 'sthaayee bhav' 'krodh' he tathaa iskaa varna rakt evam devtaa rudra he
 The example of raudra rasa has already been inscribed from Keshavdas's 'ramachandrika'
 bhushan kii rachanaaon main bhi raudra ras ke udhaaharan mil jate hai
 In the present day, the compositions of Shyamnarayan Pandey and 'dinkar' have had an effective expression of raudra rasa
 sanskrit ke granthon main ‘mahabharat’ tathaa ‘vircharit’, ‘venisanhaar’ ityadi naatakon main raudra ras kii prabhoot abhivyakti hui he
 Examples - shringaar, raudra tathaa vibhats ke saath viraras ko bhi bharat muni ne mul rason main pariganit kiya he
 The origin of the amazing juice has been revealed from Veer Ras
 vir ras kaa 'varna' 'swarna' athwa 'gaur' tathaa devtaa indra kahe gayi hai
 It is associated with good nature and its abiding spirit is 'enthusiasm'
 vir ras ke keval yudhvir, dharmaveer, dayavir tathaa daanveer bhed sweekaar kiye jate hai
 Panditraj etc
 has made many other distinctions as the basis of enthusiasm
 udhaaharan - Bharatamuni of wonderful rasa has made two distinctions - Divya and Anandaj
 vaishnav acharya iske drusht, shrut, sankirtit tathaa anumit naamak bhed karte hai
 According to Bibhats Bharata and Dhananjaya, there are three types of pure, decaying and udvegi
 bhayanak karanbhed se vyajjanya yaa bhramajanit, aparaadhjanya yaa kaalpanik tathaa vitrasitak yaa vaastavik naam se teen prakaar kaa or swanishtha paranishth bhed se do prakaar kaa mana jaataa he
 On the basis of the similarity of a particular symptom of the permanence or of some sense of the juices, the tendency of the juices to enter into each other, to reject a permanence, to be considered as new permanent has also been shown occasionally
 yatha, shant ras or dayavir tathaa vibhats main se dayavir kaa shant main antarbhaav tathaa bibhats sthaayee jugupsa ko shant kaa sthaayee mana gaya he
 "nagananda" considers the play to be a play of calm and a play on mercy by Dayavir
 kintu yadi shant ke tatvagyanamoolak viraam or dayavir ke karunajanit utsaah par dhyaan diya jaae to donon main bhinnata dikhaai degi
 Similarly, the distraction in Jugupsa does not remain in the quiet
 shant raag-dwesh donon se pare samavastha or tatvagyansanmilit ras he jisamen jugupsa sanchari maatr ban sakati he
 Just like in Karun, there is a sense of sympathy and in Dayavir, but in Karun, there is a state of mourning and in Dayavir, there is a sympathetic self-proclaimed enthusiasm
 athwa, jaise raudra or yudhvir donon kaa alamban shatru he, at: donon main krodh kii maatra rahati he, parantu raudra main rahanevaali pramodpratikul tikshnata or avivek or yudhvir main utsah kii utfullata or vivek rahata he
 In anger, there is a sense of vengeance in hostility and in valor patience and generosity
 atev inkaa paraspar antarbhaav sambhav nahin
 Similarly, it is also not appropriate to consider "anmarsha" as permanent of Veer, because Amarsha manifests as Abhinivesh or self-respecting sense of mind due to condemnation, insult or objection, but in this kind of distinctions of Veeras called Dayavir, Danavir, and Dharmaveer The feeling does not last

 In this game, there is often a dilemma in the mind of both the players
 agar lage ki doosraa darkar hat jayega to date rahanaa chahie
 The loss of the one who is removed also includes insulting the other, because the other one seems brave while the one who withdraws is a coward

 madras se rail-gaadi yatriyon ko kareeb baees ghante main rameshwaram pahunchaa detii he
 On the way, the train has to change at Pamban station

Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga kuru kshetra kii yubhumi main shrikrishna ne arjuna ko jo upadesh diya tha vah shrimadbhagavadagita ke naam se prasiddh he
 It is part of Bhishma Parva of Mahabharata
 gita main 18 adhyay or 720 shloke hai
 As stated in the Shankara commentary of the Gita - t धर्म Dharmān Bhagavata as specified Ved Vyāsya: Sarvānoghobhāva गीa Gītākhyai: Saptabhi: Shlokashatairu Panibandha
 gyaat hota he ki lagbhag 20veen sadi ke shuru main gita press gorakhpur ke saamne gita kaa vahi paath tha jo aaj hamen uplabdh he
 Around the 20th century, Bhishmaparva had a translation into the language of Java
 usamen anek mulshlok bhi surakshit hai
 According to Shripad Krishna Belvelkar, in this ancient version of Java, only one and a half eighty-one verses of the Gita are of Sanskrit origin
 unase bhi vartmaan paath kaa samarthan hota he
 The Gita is counted in the Prasthanatrayi, which includes the Upanishads and the Brahmasutras
 atev bhartiya parampara ke anusaar gita kaa sthaan vahi he jo upanishad or brahmasutron kaa he
 In the greatness of the Gita, the Upanishads have been called cow and the Gita is its milk
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki upanishdon kii jo aadhyatm vidya thi, usko gita sarvansh main sweekaar karti he
 Many of the Upanishads are in the Gita
 jaise, sansar ke swaroop ke sambandh main ashwatth vidya, anadi ajanma brahm ke vishay main avyayapurush vidya, para prakruti yaa jeev ke vishay main aksharpurush vidya or aparaa prakruti yaa bhautik jagat ke vishay main ksharpurush vidya
 Thus the specific content of both the Brahmanism of the Vedas and the spirituality of the Upanishads is embedded in the Gita
 use hi pushpika ke shabdon main brahmavidya kaha gaya he
 In the Gita, 'theosophy' refers to the retirement of knowledge
 ise sankhyamat kaha jaataa he jiske saath nivrittimargi jeevanapaddati judi hui he
 But the Gita goes beyond the turn of the Upanishads to the era when a new philosophy was being born which considered the propitious religion of the householders as equivalent to the path of isolation and equally fruitful
 isi kaa sanket denevaala gita kii pushpika main ‘yogashastre’ shabd he
 Here 'yogasastra' refers to Karmayog, of course
 gita main yoga kii do paribhaashaayen pai jaati hai
 From the point of view of a retirement path, which has been called 'samatvam Yoga Uchhyate', that is, it is yoga to be equitable in contrasting qualities
 sankhya kii sthiti yahi he
 The second definition of yoga is 'yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam', that is, even while engaged in Karma, do the work in such a way that it is not the cause of bondage and the Karmakar can keep himself in the same dissonance or uninterrupted condition that the Jnanmargis get
 isi yukti kaa naam buddhiyog he or yahi gita ke yoga kaa saar he
 The tune of 'tasya Prajnapratishthita', which is found in the second chapter of the Gita, refers to the potential intelligence of Nirlep Karma
 yah karm ke sanyas dwaara vairaygy praapt karne kii sthiti na thi balki karm karte hue pade pade man ko vairagyavaali sthiti main dhaalane kii yukti thi
 This is the Karma Yoga of the Gita
 jaise mahabharat ke anek sthalon main, vaise hi gita main bhi sankhya ke nivritti maarg or karm ke pravritimarg kii vyakhya or prashansa pai jaati he
 The condemnation of one and the praise of the other is not the opinion of the Gita, both ways can and are beneficial for human beings with two types of interest
 sambhavat: sansar kaa doosraa koi bhi granth karm ke shaastra kaa pratipaadan is sundarataa, is sookshmata or nishpakshta se nahin karata
 From this point of view, Gita is a wonderful human scripture
 isaki drushti ekangi nahin, sarvangpurn he
 The joy of literature while rendering philosophy in the Gita is its additional specialty
 tatvagyan kaa susanskrit kavyastylee ke dwaara varnan gita kaa nijee saurabh he jo kisi bhi sahruday ko mugdh kiye bina nahin rahata
 That is why it was named Bhagavad Gita, the knowledge sung by God
 shrimadbhagavadgita kii prishthbhumi mahabharat kaa yuddh he
 Just as a normal person gets entangled in the problems of his life and after that, he makes up his mind to flee from the life's confluence, similarly Arjun, who is the great hero of Mahabharata, is afraid of the problems facing him and his life and Kshatriya religion
 Disappointed, just like Arjun, all of us sometimes get frustrated either in a state of uncertainty and or because of our problems
 Dismisses off duty
 bharat varsh ke rishiyon ne gahan vichaar ke pashchaat jis gyaan ko aatmsaat kiya use unhone vedon kaa naam diya
 The last portion of these Vedas is known as Upanishad
 maanav jivan kii visheshta maanav ko praapt bauddhik shakti he or upanishdon main nihit gyaan maanav kii bauddhikta kii ucchtam avasthaa to he hi, apitu buddhi kii simaaon ke pare manushya kya anubhav kar saktaa he uski ek jhalak bhi dikhaa detaa he
 The themes mentioned in the 18 chapters of the Gita are also ordered concordantly
 pratham adhyay kaa naam arjunavishadayog he
 He presents a unique theatrical theater of the teachings of the Gita, in which both the listener and the speaker tend to solve the intricate problem of life, not for the sake of peace
 shaury or dhairya, saahas or bal in chaaron gunon kii prabhoot maatra se arjuna kaa vyaktitv bana tha or in chaaron ke upar do gun or the ek kshamaa, duusari pragna
 Arrived in a position derived from Balapradhan Kshatradharma, Arjuna's mind suddenly attacked another type of emotion, Karpanya
 ek vicitra prakaar kii karunaa uske man main bhar gai or uskaa kshaatr swabhaav lupt ho gaya
 He was alienated from the duty for which he was committed
 upar se dekhne par to is sthiti ke paksh main uske tark dharmayukt jaan padate hai, kintu usne swayan hi use carpanya dosha kaha he or yah mana he ki man kii is kaatarata ke kaaran uskaa janmasiddh swabhaav upahat yaa nasht ho gaya tha
 He was not able to decide whether to fight or take restlessness
 kya kare, kya na kare, kuch samaj main nahin aata tha
 Upon reaching the peak of this mood, he put Dhanushbana aside
 krishna ne arjuna kii vah sthiti dekhakar jaan liya ki arjuna kaa sharir thik he kintu yuddh aarambh hone se pehle hi us adbhut kshatriya kaa manobal tut chukaa he
 This body cannot stand without the mind
 atev krishna ke saamne ek guru kartavya aa gaya
 Hence Arjuna's salvation from logic, from intellect, from knowledge, from the discussion of karma, from the nature of the world, from the state of life in him, from the introduction of the regulator Akshay Purush, and from the vision of that supremely supreme authority
 This was his goal
 isi tatvacharchaa kaa vishay gita he
 In the first chapter, Arjuna, as a role in the usual manner, told God his position
 duusare adhyay kaa naam sankhyayog he
 In it, two ancient traditions of life have been described by arguments
 arjuna ko us kripan sthiti main rote dekhakar krishna ne uskaa dhyaan dilaayaa he ki is prakaar kaa clayvy or hriday kii kshudra durbalata arjuna jaise vir ke liye uchit nahin
 Krishna called all the tips given by Arjuna till now a false form of enlightenment
 unki yukti yah he ki pragyadarshan kaal, karm or swabhaav se honevaale sansar kii sab ghatnaon or sthitiyon ko anivaary rup se sweekaar karata he
 Live and die, be born and grow, subjects come and go
 sukh or dukh kaa anubhav, ye to sansar main hote hi hai, isi ko pracheen acharya paryaaywad kaa naam bhi dete the
 The cycle of time brings and takes all these conditions
 jivan ke is swabhaav ko jaan lene par phir shok nahin hota
 This is the satire of God that why even Arjuna has fallen into this kind of fascination, considering Pragya's point of view
 upar ke drushtikon kaa ek aavashyak ang jivan kii nityata or sharir kii anityata tha
 Mourning for the eternal creature is as futile as the worry of saving the eternal body
 ye donon aprihaary hai
 It is not appropriate to grieve as birth and death occur in turn
 phir ek doosraa drushtikon swadharm kaa he
 Since birth, nature has set a religion for everyone
 usamen jivan kaa maarg, ichchhaaon kii paridhi, karm kii shakti sabhi kuch aa jaataa he
 It cannot be escaped
 koi bhaage bhi to prakrutti use phir khinch laati he
 In this way, the change or magnitude of Kaal, the continuity of the living being and the self-righteousness or nature of the tips by which God has explained to Arjuna, he has called the wisdom of Sankhya
 isse aage arjuna ke prashn na karne par bhi unhone yogamarg kii buddhi kaa bhi varnan kiya
 This intellect is the intelligence of the urge of karma or tendency path, while doing karma, it is necessary to protect oneself from attachment to the fruits of karma
 karmyogi ke liye sabase bada dar yahi he ki vah fal kii ichha ke dal dal main fas jaataa he; usase use bachanaa chahie
 Arjuna wondered if it is possible to get this kind of intelligence
 vyakti karm kare or fal na chaahe to uski kya sthiti hogi, yah ek vyaavhaarik shankaa thi
 He asked how does such a strong-minded person behave in life? Coming, going, eating, drinking, doing deeds, how can we be abused even after indulging in them? Krishna has explained the restraint of the mind in comparison to how many external senses
 kaam, krodh, bhay, raag, dwesh ke dwaara man kaa saumybhav bighad jaataa he or indriyaan vash main nahin rahati
 Indrajaya is the biggest self-respect
 baahar se koi vishyon ko chhod bhi de to bhi bheetar kaa man nahin maanata
 When the taste of subjects goes through the mind, then the mind becomes cheerful, calm and happy
 samudr main nadiyaan aakar milti hai par vah apni maryaada nahin chodta
 While living in such a world, accepting its practices, many desires keep entering the mind
 kintu unase jiskaa man apni maryaada nahin khota use hi shanti milti hai
 It is called Brahmi Situation in the Gita in the definition of ancient spirituality
 is prakaar sankhya kii vyakhya kaa uttar sunakar karmyog naamak tisare adhyay main arjuna ne is vishay main or gaharaa utarane ke liye spasht prashn kiya ki sankhya or yoga in donon margon main aap kise acha samajhate hai or kyon nahin yah nishchit kehete ki main in donon main se kise apanaaun? isapar krishna ne bhi utani hi spashtataa se uttar diya ki lok main do nishthaayen yaa jeevandrushtiyaan hai-sankhyavaadiyon ke liye gyanayog he or karmmargiyon ke liye karmyog he
 Here no person can give up karma
 prakruti teenon gunon ke prabhaav se vyakti ko karm karne ke liye baadhya karti he
 There is a great doubt about the survivors of karma, that is that they leave karma from the top, but the mind is immersed in it
 yah sthiti asay he or ise krishna ne gita main mithyaachaar kaha he
 The simple human way is to do karma by stopping the karmadrians in the mind
 krishna ne chunauti ke rup main yahan tak kah diya ki karm ke bina to khaane ke liye ann bhi nahin mil saktaa
 Then Krishna introduced the law of karma as a cycle
 na keval saamaajik dharaatal par bhinn vyaktiyon ke karmchakr aron kii tarah aapas main piroe hue hai balki prithvi ke manushya or swarg ke devtaa donon kaa sambandh bhi karmchakr par ashrith he
 It is obvious that here humans do work, do agriculture, and divine powers send rain water
 ann or parjanya donon karm se utpann hote hai
 Human actions in one, divine actions in the other
 phir karm ke paksh main loksangrah kii yukti di gai he, arthath karm ke bina samaaj kaa dhaanchaa khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Those who are leaders of the world, knowledgeable like Janak also have a tendency in karma
 krishna ne swayan apana hi drushtaant dekar kaha ki main narayan kaa rup hoon, mere liye kuch karm shesh nahin he
 Still i do deeds without sleep and others walk my path
 antar itnaa hi he ki jo murkh hai ve lipt hokar karm karte hai par gyani asang bhav se karm karata he
 In the Gita, here is a well-known word, intelligence
 arthath jo saadhaaran samaj ke log karm main lage hai unhen us maarg se ukhaadnaa uchit nahin, kyonki ve gyanavaadee ban nahin sakate, or yadi unka karm bhi chhot gaya to ve donon ore se bhatak jaayange
 In the fourth chapter, whose name is Jnana-karma-sanyas-yoga, it has been told that by which knowledge the fruits of karmasanyas can be obtained while doing karma
 isamen sachche karmyog ko chakravarti raajaaon kii parampara main ghatit mana he
 Illustrations of several Chakravarti kings such as Mandhata, Sudarshan are given
 yaheen gita kaa vah prasiddh aashwaasan he ki jab jab dharm kii glani hoti he tab tab manushyon ke bich bhagwaan kaa avatar hota he, arthath bhagwaan kii shakti vishesh rup se moort hoti he
 It is here that a sentence deserves special attention - Kshipraman manushe lokay siddhirbhavati karmaja
 ‘karm se siddhi’-isse bada prabhaavshaalee sutara gitadarshan main nahin he
 But Geetatattva improves and corrects this sutra so much that it should be done in a senseless way, that is, from fellowship
 paanchave adhyay main phir ve hi yuktiyaan or drudh rup main kahin gai hai
 In this, special attention has been paid to the rites or purification of the mind which is associated with karma
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki unche dharaatal par pahunchakar sankhya or yoga main koi bhed nahin rah jaataa he
 If you walk properly on any one path, then you get the same result
 jivan ke jitne karm hai, sabko samarpan kar dene se vyakti ekadam shanti ke dhruv bindu par pahunch jaataa he or jal main khile camel ke samaan karm rupi jal se lipt nahin hota
 The sixth chapter is Atamsayam Yoga, whose subject is revealed by name
 jitne vishay hai un sabase indriyon kaa sanyam-yahi karm or gyaan kaa nichod he
 The same state of mind in happiness and in sorrow is called Yoga
 saatven adhyay kii sangya gyanvigyaan yoga he
 These are two definitions of ancient Indian philosophy
 unamem bhi vigyaan shabd vaidic drushti se bahut hi mahatvapurn tha
 The knowledge of the infinitude of the universe is science and progress from monotony to unity is knowledge
 ye donon drushtiyaan maanav ke liye uchit hai
 In this context, the definite explanation of these two forms of placenta and para nature from the point of view of science is definitely worthy of attention
 aparaa prakruti main aath tatv hai, panchabhoot, man, buddhi or ahankaar
 The egg from which a human is born
 usamen ye aathon rahete hai
 But this is the natural canto, ie it is the root
 isamen ishwar kii cheshtaa ke sampark se jo chetana aati he use para prakruti kehete hai; vahi jeev he
 Life becomes the ninth element together with the eight elements
 is adhyay main bhagwaan ke anek roopon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he jinka or vistaar vibhootiyog naamak dasven adhyay main aata he
 There is also a mention of the special Bhagwati vision, which has the same deity in the sutra-vasudeva: sarvamiti, sub vasu or bodies, its noun is Vishnu
 kintu lok main apni apni ru chi ke anusaar anek naamon or roopon main usee ek devtatv kii upasna kii jaati he
 they are all fine
 kintu acha yahi he ki budhimaan manushya us brahmatatv ko pahachaane jo aadhyatm vidya kaa sarvocch shikhar he
 The noun of the eighth chapter is the syllable Brahmayog
 upanishdon main akshar vidya kaa vistaar hua
 In the Gita, the essence of that syllogism has been said - the syllable is the noun syllable of Brahma Paramana, that is, Parabrahma
 manushya, arthath jeev or sharir kii sanyukt rachana kaa hi naam aadhyatm he
 The noun of the living physical body is Kshar and only the noun of power is superficial
 deh ke bheetar jeev, ishwar tathaa bhoot ye teen shaktiyaan milakar jis prakaar kaary karti hai use adhiyagya kehete hai
 The lyricist has tied the form of these six definitions in two verses
 gita ke shabdon main ekakshar brahm he 
 The ninth chapter has been called Rajaguhyayoga, that is, it is spiritual science student and this secret knowledge is the best among all
 raja shabdaka ek arth man bhi tha
 Therefore, how the divine powers of the mind can be made cosmic is its strategy
 is kshetra main brahmatatv kaa nirupan hi pradhan he, usee se vyakt jagat kaa barambar nirmaan hota he
 All the ritualistic rituals of the Veda are Yajna, Amrit, and death, saint and dissent, and all the gods and goddesses, all of whom are in Brahma
 lok main jo anek prakaar kii devpuja prachlit he, vah bhi apane apane sthaan main thik he, samanvay kii yah drushti bhagwat aacharyon ko maanya thi, vastut: yah unki badi shakti thi
 The idea or interpretation of this approach is found in the tenth chapter
 iskaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The essence of it is that all the gods in the world, all are deities of the same God, all the qualities and demerits of a human being are forms of the power of God
 buddhi se in chhutbhaye devataaon kii vyakhya chaahe ne ho sake kintu lok main to vah hai hi
 Someone is worshiping Peepal
 koi pahaad ko koi nadi yaa samudr ko, koi unamem rahanevaale machhlee, kachhuon ko
 There is no end to so many gods
 vishwa ke itihaas main devataaon kii yah bharmaar sarvatra pai jaati he
 Accepting their power, the Bhagavats gave everyone a new vision of coordination, considering them as the form of Vishnu
 isi kaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The entity which is strong or miraculous is the form of God
 itnaa maan lene se chitt nirvirodh sthiti main pahunch jaataa he
 The 11th chapter is titled Vishwaroopadarshan Yoga
 isamen arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa vishwaroop dekha
 Virat Roop means the visible vision of the eternal world above the human plane and periphery
 vishnu kaa jo chaturbhuj rup he, vah maanviya dharaatal par saumyrup he
 When Arjuna saw the great form of God, his forehead exploded
 ‘disho na jane na labhe c shame’ ye hi ghabrahat ke vaakya unke mukh se nikle or usne prarthana kii ki maanav ke liye jo swaabhaavik sthiti ishwar ne rakhi he, vahi paryaapt he
 In the 13th chapter, there is a direct subject area and the idea of the jurisdictional
 yah sharir kshetra he, uskaa jaananevaala jeevatma kshetrajna he
 The name of the 14th chapter is Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga
 yah vishay samast vaidic, darshanik or puranic tatvachintan kaa nichod he-satv, raj, tam naamak teen gun-triko kii anek vyakhyaayein hai
 The name of the equilibrium of qualities is Pradhan or Prakriti
 gunon ke vaishamy se hi vaikrut sristi kaa janm hota he
 The solitary entity remains calm like a pure light with a calm nature, and the lonely soul is still idle
 kintu donon ke bich main chaaya hua rajogun unhen cheshtaa ke dharaatal par khinch laata he
 The name of the motion element is Rajas
 15wein adhyay kaa naam purushottamyog he
 In it, the world is described as Ashwattha
 yah ashwatth rupi sansar mahaan vistaarwaala he
 There is no end to this in the country and time
 kintu iskaa jo mul yaa centre he, jise urdhv kehete hai, vah brahm hi he ek ore vah param tej, jo vishwarupi ashwatth ko janm detaa he, surya or chandra ke rup main prakat he, duusari ore vahi ek ek chaitanya centre main yaa praani sharir main aayaa hua he
 As it is clearly stated in the Gita - Ego vishvakanaro bhutva praninam dehamashrit:
 vaishwanar yaa pranmayi chetana se badhkar or doosraa rahasy nahin he
 There are three males or males - Kshar, Akshar and Avayya
 panchabhuton kaa naam kshar he, praan kaa naam akshar he or manastatv yaa chetana kii sangya avyay he
 Human consciousness is born from the collected position of these three males, which the sages have called the global fire
 16wein adhyay main devasur sampatti kaa vibhaag bataaya gaya he
 From the very beginning, the universe has been conceived in Rigdeva as divine and demonic powers
 yah sristi ke dwiviruddh rup kii kalpana he, ek acha or doosraa bura
 One in light, the other in darkness
 ek amrit, doosraa martya
 One truth, the other unknowable
 17wein adhyay kii sangya shraddhatray vibhaag yoga he
 It is related to these three qualities, Sat, Raz and Tama, that is, the virtue in which one arises, his devotion or loyalty to life becomes the same
 yajna, tap, daan, karm ye sab teen prakaar kii shraddha se sanchalit hote hai
 Even diet is of three types
 unke bhed or lakshan gita ne yahan bataae hai
 The noun of 18th chapter is moksha sanyasana yoga
 isamen gita ke samast upadeshon kaa saar evam upsanhaar he
 Here again, the importance of three qualities for human life has been said
 prithvi ke maanvon main or swarg ke devataaon main koi bhi aisa nahin jo prakruti ke chalaae hue in teen gunon se bachaa ho
 It is necessary to walk well after watching a man so that he can protect his intellect and instinct from evil and can identify what is work and what is not
 dharm or adharm ko, bandha or moksh ko, vritti or nivritti ko jo buddhi thik se pahachanaati he, vahi saatviki buddhi he or vahi maanav kii sachhee uplabdhi he
 In this way, God has preached the practical path to life and in the end has said that man should faithfully follow all the behaviors of the world, which is the unbroken conscious element, called God, which is the heart of every creature or Sit in the center, believe in it, experience it
 vahi jeev kii satta he, vahi chetana he or vahi sarvopari anand kaa strot he
 In the tradition of Sanskrit literature, those texts are called Bhashya, which presents a broad interpretation or commentary on the meaning of other texts
 bhartiya darshanik parampara main kisi bhi naye darshan ko yaa kisi darshan ke naye swaroop ko jad jamaane ke liye jin teen granthon par apana drushtikon spasht karnaa padataa tha unamem bhagavadgita bhi ek he 
 Many Acharyas and scholars have commented on Gita
 sampradaayon ke anusaar unki sankshipt suchi is prakaar he : Apart from these, there is a famous commentary on the name of Maharashtrian saint Gyandev or Dnyaneshwarite Bhavarthadeepika, which reveals the knowledge of Gita in an emotional poetry style
 vartmaan yug main lokmaanya bal gangadhar tilakkrut gitarahasya tikaa, jo atyant vistrut bhoomika tathaa vivechan ke saath pehali baar 1915 i
 Published in Poona, the Gita occupies an important place in literature
 usne gita ke mul arthon ko vidwaanon tak pahunchaane main aisa mode diya he jo shankaracharya ke baad aaj tak sambhav nahin hua tha
 In fact, Shankaracharya's commentary gives the main meaning of the Gita, while the Tilak proves the Gita as the proponent of karma
 bhagavadgita par uplabdh sabhi bhashyon main shri jaidayal goyandaka kii tatv vivechni sarvaadhik lokapriy tathaa jansulabh he
 It is published by gitapress
 ajtak isaki 10 karod pratiyaan bik chuki hai
 Srimad Bhagavad Gita is maintaining its importance in the changing social scenario and due to this technological development has increased its availability, and tried to make it more comprehensible
 doordarshan par prasaarit dharawahik mahabharat main bhagavadgita vishesh aakarshan rahi, vahiin dharawahik shrikrishna main bhagavadgita par atyadhik vishad shodh karke use kai kadiyon kii ek shrunkhlaa ke rup main dikhaaya gaya
 One of its special things was that attempts were made to answer common man's doubts related to Gita through Arjuna's questions
 iske alaava nitish bharadwaj krit dharawahik gita-rahasy to purnataya gita ke hi vibhinn ayaamon par kendrit rahaa
 Even today many websites on the Internet give detailed information on this subject through multimedia
 shrimadbhagavadgita vartmaan main dharm se zyada jivan ke prati apane darshanik drushtikon ko lekar bharat main hi nahin videshon main bhi logon kaa dhyaan apni or aakarshith kar rahi he
 The Gita's message management of Nishkam Karma is also appealing to the gurus
 vishwa ke sabhi dharmon kii sabase prasiddh pustakon main shaamil he
 The publication which makes books of religious literature like Geeta Press Gorakhpur available at a very low price has also contributed greatly to the general public by publishing Srimad Bhagavad Gita in various shapes and meanings
 gita kaa upadesh atyant puraatan yoga he
 Sri Bhagavan says i first told it to Surya
 surya gyaan kaa pratik he atah shri bhagavan ke vachanon kaa taatpary he ki prithvi utpatti se pehle bhi anek swaroop anusandhan karne vaale bhakton ko yah gyaan de chukaa hoon
 It is a divine voice that has the essence and basis of all life
 main koun hoon? yah deh kya he? is deh ke saath kya meraa aadi or ant he? deh tyaag ke pashchaat kya meraa astitv rahegaa? yah astitv kahan or kis rup main hoga? mere sansar main aane kaa kya kaaran he? mere deh tyaagane ke baad kya hoga, kahan janaa hoga? kisi bhi jigyaasu ke hriday main yah baaten nirantar gumti rahati hai
 We always think about these things and do not know ourselves, our nature
 gita shaastra main in sabhi ke prashnon ke uttar sahaj dhang se shri bhagavan ne dharm samvaad ke madhyam se diye hai
 This body in which the 36 elements work together due to the presence of the soul, is called Kshetra and Jeevatma resides in this Kshetra, he is the lord of this body but there is also a third man, when he appears; Overlive means this body with 36 elements and destroys the individual soul
 yahi uttam purush hi param sthiti or param sat he
 Not only this, the real scientific and rational description of the movement of the soul located in the body and leaving the body is mentioned in the Gita Shastra
 jeevatma nity he or aatma ko jeev bhav kii prapti hui he
 At the death of the body, the individual moves in different vaginas according to his order
 gita kaa prarambh dharm shabd se hota he tathaa gita ke atharahawein adhyay ke ant main ise dharm samvaad kaha he
 Dharma means one who holds or has been held
 dhaaran karne vaala jo he use aatma kaha gaya he or jise dhaaran kiya he vah prakruti he
 The soul is the seed of this world i
e
 father and nature is the vagina that conceives, ie mother
 dharm shabd kaa prayog gita main aatm swabhaav evam jeev swabhaav ke liye jagah jagah prayukt hua he
 It is necessary to understand religion and unrighteousness in this context
 aatma kaa swabhaav dharm he athwa kaha jaay dharm hi aatma he
 The nature of the soul is absolute pure knowledge, knowledge itself is the inexhaustible abode of joy and peace
 iske vipareet agyaan, ashaanti, klesh or adharm kaa dyotak he
 The soul is the source of renewable knowledge
 gyaan shakti kii vibhinn maatra se kriya shakti kaa udai hota he, prakati kaa janm hota he
 The qualities of nature are born of sattva, raja, tam
 satva-raj kii adhikta dharm ko janm detii he, tam-raj kii adhikta hone par asuri vrittiyaan prabal hoti or dharm kii sthapana arthath gunon ke swabhaav ko sthapit karne ke liye, satogun kii vruddhi ke liye, avinashi brahmi sthiti ko praapt aatma apane sankalp se deh dhaaran kar avatar grihan karti he
 The whole Gita is a squeeze of scripture, always keep the intellect subtle and put it in the spirit of Mahabuddhi and keep doing the actions of the world as per your nature in a simple way
