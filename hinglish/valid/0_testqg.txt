 a philosophical study of individual experiences and structures of consciousness is called phenomenology or phenomenology
 isaki sthapana 20veen shatabdi ke aarmabhik dinon main adamund haserl ne kii thi
 According to phenomenology, which had a profound influence on the twentieth-century Germanic philosophy, things attain their meaning through the realization of the consciousness of the person seeing them
 yah bodh itihaas, samskruti or isi tarah ke puri tarah se pramanit na kiye ja sakane vaale karkon kii dein hota he
 According to phenomenology, if these factors are separated from experience, then a pure subjectivity can be achieved at the level of knowledge
 is darshan ke sansthaapak german darshanik edmand hasar the
 He said that all kinds of consciousness are always intentional or intentional
 yani ham keval sachet nahin hote, balki kisi na kisi vastu ke prati sachet hote hai
 That object does not necessarily have to exist physically
 masalan, agar kisi ko lag rahaa he ki uske saamne ek nachlistaan maujuud he to vah ek marichika bhi ho sakati he
 In fact, that oasis, despite not being truly in front of the eye, is revealed to the viewer because of the meaningful connection he has made with it
 isiilie nachlistaan ho yaa uski marichika, vastu apane prekshak dwaara uske prati kii gayi apekshaayen puri kar paati he
 From this Hassar concluded that the experience of a person is not an affront to the work-cause relationship with the object
 ghatnakriyashastra ke vikaas ne darshan ke saath-saath samajashastreey or kala sambandhi chintan ko bhi kaafii prabhavit kiya
 Hassar's assistant and great philosopher Martin Heidegger took this concept towards understanding the meaning of existence and the structure of human existence
 hidagar ke alaava morris marali-ponti, jyaan-paul sartra kaa chintan bhi ghatnakriyashastra se prabhavit hua
 It is on this basis that phenomineological sociology was developed by Alfred Shuze
 ghatnakriyashastra kaa vikaas prakritik vigyaanon ke aadharbhoot siddhanton ke saath samvaad karte hue hua he
 Hassar's specialty was that he constantly reviewed his thinking and creations in the light of criticism and introspection, so he continued to develop this philosophy throughout his life
 kehane ke liye dekart or hasar kii bauddhik pariyojna ek hi thi
 Both wanted to free the knowledge base from the uncertainties
 lekin hasar kii yah vivechna darshanashastra ko dekart se aage kii manzil kii taraf le gayi
 Their aim was to develop an indispensable and definite way of seeing empirical objects
 dekart kii manyata thi ki ishwar or swayan ke astitv par shaq nahin kiya ja saktaa, par baaki har chiz par sanshay karnaa taarkik rup se sakvabhav he
 But Hassar went towards identifying the undisputed element inherent in his nature without doubting any faith or belief
 unhone chetana kii prayek kriya ko parakhte hue yah jaanane kaa prayaas kiya ki kisi vastu ke anubhav kaa purv- kalpit ghatak koun sa he
 If this pre-conceived part is kept aside without deciding whether it is right or wrong, then the truth of that experience will not matter
 kinare rakhane kii kriya ko hasar ne apni bhashaa main ‘braketing’ or sahi yaa galat kaa faisalaa na lene ko ‘ipoki’ qaraar diya
 Citing the example of a tree, he said that if the preservation of the day-to-day preservation of a tree is deferred, it will not change the tree-related experience that has been gained through consciousness
 dekart kii thisis to us jagah ruk jaati he jahaan ve ‘main’ ke hone ko asandigdh yaa gyaan kaa kam se kam ek nishchit aadhaar maan lete hai
 Hassar suggested freeing someone's experience of being from the pre-imaginations contained in it
 chintan ke kshetra main yah ek radical kadam tha
 There are historical, cultural and material factors at the basis of the pre-made understanding associated with the experience of the object whose authenticity always remains under doubt
 agar kisi vastu yaa vyakti kii sachhee samaj banani he to use aitihaasik shai ke taur par nahin samajhnaa chahie, kyonki us surat main vah samaj purvagrahon or purv-dharanaon ke filtaron se chhan kar aayegi
 In this way the method of obtaining a definite knowledge of a pure and unchanging subjectivity in the form of phenomenology emerged
 1901 se 1913 ke bich prakashit hasar kii do rachanaayen logical investigations or idiaz partining tu a pyor finominolji and finominoljical filosphi is darshan kaa pramukh granth maani jaati hai
 The main problem of this influential theory of knowledge was how to remove it from the limits of being fascinated by philosophers
 rozmarra ke saamudayik jivan or samskruti ke jagat main gyaan-rachana kii ek swaabhaavik pravriti ke rup main isaki sthapana mushkil thi
 In his final work Crisis of European Science and Transcendental Phenomenology published in 1938, Hassar tried to find a solution to this problem
 unhone prakritik vigyaanon ke siddhantaparak ravaiye kii kadi aalochana karte hue use vyaktiparak ravaiye ke barakes rakhaa
 He said that natural sciences put so much emphasis on work-cause relationship and quantitativeness that different motivations, beliefs and desires of an individual have no importance for them
 chetana ke sabhipraay hone kii thisis or viksit karte hue unhone kaha ki alag- alag ravaiyon ke aadhaar par log apni-apni duniyaaon kii samaj banaate hai
 The influence of Hassar and phenomenology in the field of aesthetics can be seen in the formulations of Roman Ingarden
 saahitiyik rachana ko ek sabhipraay vastu maan kar ingarden uski shinaakht uske kisi bhautik tatva ke aadhaar par karne se inkaar karte hai
 According to this view, literary work is endowed with a durable kind of identity independent of its diverse interpretations
 kriti kii samalochna karte hue pathak uske saar par dhyaan detaa he or us prakriya main kalpana-aadhaarit tattvon kii saamagree se vah thos nishkarsh nikaalata he jo lekhak dwaara anirdhaarit chhod diya gaya he
 Hassar's followers, influenced by the basic thesis of phenomenology, did not accept his sentimental attitude
 hasar kaa darshan jis prekshak ke anubhav par kendrit tha uske kamobesh amoort astitv ke mukaable hidagar or unke baad sartra ne apana chintan ek aise prekshak par kendrit kiya jiskaa taalluk ek vaastavik, bhautik or sparshy jagat se tha
 Hassar saw the meaning of experience as an essential and universal essence, while Heidegger interpreted that meaning as the result of experience while going through the practical problems of life
 hidagar ne kaha ki manushya hathode kaa jo istemaal karata he, usee ke mutabik uski samaj banaata he
 Therefore, ordinary human beings compose their knowledge by pursuing different goals instead of universal understanding made of phenomenology according to phenomenology

 The principle of lapse or usurpation was a recipe prepared in 1848 by Lord Dalhousie, the Governor General of British India, to deal with the questions related to the succession of Hindu Indian states in Indian history

 Lord Dalhousie emphasized the ultimate right to approve such adoptions and to act at their discretion in the absence of adoptions in the case of dependent states

 The derivation of uncertainty principle was given by Heisenberg in 1927 AD from the comprehensive laws of quantum mechanics
 is siddhanth ke anusaar kisi gatiman kan kii sthiti or samveg ko ek saath ekadam thik-thik nahin mapa ja saktaa
 If one amount is measured with more precision, the same impurity will increase in the measurement of the other, no matter how efficient it is in measuring it
 in raashiyon kii ashuddhiyon kaa gunanfal plank niyatank se kam nahin ho saktaa
 If there is an error of δ x { \ displaystyle \ Delta x}, when measuring a position particle x of a moving particle and δ p { \ displaystyle \ Delta p}, in measuring its momentum p in the direction of the x-axis
 According to this theory - jahaan, ħ = h / 2 π { \ displaystyle \ hbar =h / 2 \ pi }, h plank niyatank he
 This shows that both a particle of a particle and a tatangan component of its momentum cannot be known simultaneously and if the uncertainty of one of these two conjugate quantities is very low, the other is very high
 anischitata ke sambandh ek ore to kan kii sthiti kii kisi tarang se sangati sthapit karne kii sambhaavna ke niyamon ke tathaa duusari ore prayiktamulak nirvachan ke vyapak niyamon ke anivaary parinaam hai
 Heisenberg and Mohr, after a thorough and thorough analysis of the measurement process, proved that the results of any measurement cannot be counter to the uncertainty principle
 yadi ham kisi kan kii sthiti n ekadam shuddh maap len to isaki sthiti kii anischitata qn shunya baraabar hogi
 Then the uncertainty of the momentum of that particle according to the laws of mathematics: arthath aparimit ho jaaegi
 Therefore, we are bound to arrive at the simple conclusion that the moment at which we get an accurate measurement of the position of the particle, its velocity at that time becomes indefinite
 agar kisi kshankaal par kan kaa veg param yatharthata se mapa jaataa he to us kshankaal par kan kii sthiti kya thi, yah pataa lagane kaa hamaare paas vikalp nahin rahata
 In such a situation, the measurement of both position and momentum is possible only within certain uncertainties

 In the early stages, or with self-realization, architecture takes place in the occupations, or occupations necessary for the limited purposes of humans — often to provide some kind of defense for humans

 Architecture is also said to bring to light the social status of the ancient period

 It has also been said that architecture is nothing more than ornamentation of buildings
 jahaan tak aitihaasik vaastukala kaa sambandh he, yah anshat: satya he
 Then architecture is also called the mold of civilization

 The achievements of each historical architecture can be broadly determined by two fundamental principles, one which is embedded in the concept and the other which signifies supreme uniqueness
 misri vaastu main yah yugottarajive vishaal or baari smarakon dwaara vyakt rahasyamyata he, asyrian, babinloni or irani kala main, yah shastrshakti or vilaasi jivan tha, unani kala main yah nishchayatmak aayojana or sanshodhit drushtibhram tha jiske falswaroop saadagi or parishkrut purnataa ai
 It was the love of grandeur, enjoyment and power among the Romans that resulted in a unique scientific creation
 purakalin isaayiyon main yah isamsih kii sachhee saadagi or gaurav vyakt karanevaale girjagharon ke nirmaan ke prati baari utsaah ke rup main tha; gothic nirmaataaon main yah sanrachana yantriki ke gyaan se yukt utkar shakti thi; italvi punaruddhar main yah us yug kii vidvatta thi
 The outstanding quality of Buddhist and Hindu architecture is its metaphysics, which is evident in its development
 musalamaani vaastukala main acolpaneey dhan sampada, thaat or vishaal bhukhand par uskaa prabhutv jhalkata he; jabaki bharat kaa bhimkaay afgani vaastu us shashan kii aakraamak pravriti prakat karata he; kintu mughal smarak utkrisht anupaat mughalon ke or kriti sambandhi prem ko darshane main shreshth hai tathaa bharat kii garmi main unka jivan bhaleebhanti vyakt karte hai
 Thus in the past works we see that the rock, bricks and stones are the only ideas which express the above and reliably, in some way or the other, the religious or other awakening of civilizations that have reached the pinnacle of glory

 In this way we try to build buildings of our era and later these buildings will build caste by encouraging healthy development of body and brain
 iske atirikt ham dekhte hai ki vaastukala kabhi kabhi gyaat upyogita sambandhi aavashyaktaaon or uski nirmaan paddatiyon se aage bhi bad jaati he
 In architecture itself, a pure creation of imagination, when expressed with a wide barrage of all perspectives, is able to reach the pinnacle of perfection, such as Athena with the head of juice in Greece, or the simile of Swayambhu in India
 isamen andeh nahin ki vaastukala kaa aadhaar imaaraten hai, kintu yah imaaraten khadi karne ke atirikt kuch or bhi hai jaise kavita gadhy rachana ke rachana ke atirikt kuch or bhi he
 Poetry is impressive when sung in a sweet tone, but when it is accompanied by appropriate music and rhythmic dance efforts, it not only attracts the human heart and the different senses, but also the whole atmosphere created by their glorious combination
 She makes him aware
 isi prakaar vaastukalpanaayen, darshanik gatividhiyon se, kavyamay abhivyaktiyon se or sammilit layaatmak, sangitatmak tathaa varnatmak arthon se paripurna hoti hai or aisi utkrisht vaastukritiyaan maanav ke antarmanas ko chooti hui sabhi prakaar se uski prashansa kaa paatr hoti hai or phir vishwavyaapee khyaati arjeet karti hai
 This commendation of unanimous great objects is everlasting and inspires future generations
 yah satya he ki vaastukala ke prayogon main bahut asthirataa rahi he, jisase aganit sheliyaan prakat ho gai hai
 But what purpose does any of those styles have? Or what is their relation to his era? The truth is that architecture is neither a creed nor a style, but it is an inexhaustible sequence of development
 isliye vaastu ko shaileyon se vishesh prayojan nahin, jaise badalte hue fishan se kisi mahila kii poshaak kaa koi sambandh nahin
 In this subject, Frank Lloyd Wright has said that the periphery of architecture keeps on moving here and there, its center does not change
 aadhunik vaastukala kaa or vyapak arthon main, vaastukala kaa vikaas vinyas kii sanrachanaatmak aavashyaktaaon or uplabdh saamagree kii saundaryasambhaavnaaon dwaara prastut pratibandhon kii upasthiti main sundarataa ke liye khoj or sangharsh ke falswaroop hua he
 When a creation of a creation results in them, then it seems that today's architecture is a sculpture expressed in the form of heavy compositions and frequencies

 Electromagnetic or 'energetics' are generally called all those devices used to measure electrical energy
 vidyut-maapi praayah kilowat-ghanta main anshaankit hote hai
 Some electrical measurements are arranged for special functions, such as the maximum demand detector, which consists of a time fraction with a meter that directs maximum energy over a certain period of time
 kuch vidyut-maapi aise bhi hote hai jo mahattam lod ke samay main swayan lod ko kaat den
 In order to measure the electrical energy that is suitable in a given period, it is necessary that the current, voltage and power coefficient in the electromagnetic circuit are able to make proper measurements of the three and measure the energy spent in a given period by integrating them
 
 is prakaar kisi bhi vidyutmapi main do anshak hote hai : The power fraction is of different nature in direct current and alternating current
 disht dhara main, shakti gunank na hone ke kaaran, shakti anshak kaa keval dhara tathaa voltata kaa gunan karne main samarth hona paryaapt he
 If the voltage is assumed to be constant, only current measurement can work
 is rup main vidyutmapi vastut: ampiore-ghanta meter ho jaataa he
 It only tells how much current has been used in a certain period of time
 is prakaar ek ampiore-ghanta se taatpary he ki nishchit voltata par 1 ghante main 1 ampiore dhara upbhukt kii gai hai
 Although such devices are simple in design, they obviously cause a fault in the energy directed by them as the voltage decreases
 tab bhi apane saral banaavat ke kaaran, saamaanya upyogon ke liye ye bahut upyukt hote hai
 In the above type of meter, a disk of aluminum is attached to a closed cell, so that it can be freely operated
 prakoshth main paara bharaa hota he or discs paare ke utplavan par avlambit rahata he
 Due to the relative density of 13
6, the mercury exerts considerable penetration on the disc, reducing the pressure on the bearings and allowing the disc to rotate
 discs ke donon ore do chumbak hote hai, jinamein se ek chaalan chumbak kehalaata he: or doosraa brake chumbak 
 It also acts as a carrier of a stream
 dhara ghuraagra se hokar discs main areey bahati he or vahaan se paare main hokar prakoshth par ke sthir terminal main jaati he
 Thus the circuit is completed through the mercury and the current flowing through the excitation coil of the conduction magnet exerts a driving force on the disk
 discs paribhraman ke liye swamantra hone ke kaaran ghoomane lagata he
 His brake revolves around the magnet field, applying brake force on it
 brake-chumbak kii sthiti kaa vyavasthaapan karne se discs kii gati main parivartan kiya ja saktaa he
 If the motor is not running properly, the position of the stopping magnet can be corrected by administering it
 duusare prakaar ke ampiore ghanta maapiyon main dhara ke vidyut apghatni prabhaav kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Over a given period of time, the amount of residue that is passed through the electrolyte is deposited in proportion to the energy consumed in the circuit
 parantu is praroop ke metron kii banaavat majboot nahin hoti or unhen baar baar vyavasthit karnaa padataa he
 Therefore, meters of this type are not very popular
 disht dhara ke metron main shakti anshak watametre jaise hi hote hai
 They actually have two circuits, in donon kundaliyon kii dhara evam voltata ke kshanik maanon dwaara prabhavit hone ke kaaran, anshak kaa chalanatantr paripath main ausat shakti kaa parichaayak hota he

 Meters, mainly, are of two types: donon meter vastav main apane apane praroop ke watametre par hi aadhaarit hote hai
 Energy can be measured only by combining the calipers with the thermometer
 kashenshak vastav main ghadi kii bhanti hota he, jo nishchit avadhi main shakti kaa samakarlan kar urja kaa nirdesh karata he
 Power can be directed only by the indicator in the wattmeter 
 jabaki vidyut maapi main discs ke paribhraman ginaney se urja kaa maapan hota he
 a calculator is used to count the revolutions of a disc or drum, from which the value of total energy can be read
 ek duusare praroop ke meter main vastut: motor kaa chota ang hi kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 It consists of a current coil, a stirrer, and a voltage coil as an armature
 armechar se saath commutator bhi hota he or sansparsh karanevaale do burush hote hai
 Thus the meter is, in fact, a minor form of motor
 ise is kaaran 'motor meter' hi kaha jaataa he, parantu yah adhik mahanga hone ke kaaran or dekhbhaal kii kathinaaiyon ke kaaran, bahut kam prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 Energy measurement in triphase circuits is also done on the basis of triphage power measurement
 trifage watametre kii bhanti, inamen bhi shakti anshak do bhaagon main sanghatit hota he or sangyojan bhi do watametre dwaara shaktimaapan ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 In this way it has 6 terminals and they are connected like a triphase wattmeter
 keval kaal anshak tathaa ganan tantra jod dene se yah urja kaa maapan kar saktaa he
 The development of microelectronics and microcontrollers etc
 has made the development of electronic energies possible
 inkaa disple LCD yaa LED par aadhaarit hota he
 Some meters also have the ability to transmit readings to remote locations
 iske alaava electranik urjamapi supplai tathaa lod ke kuch anya prachalon ko bhi record kar sakate hai, jaise- adhiktam maang, voltage, shakti gunank, reective shakti aadi
 Electronic voting is a term that includes many different types of voting, including the inclusion of both the electronic means used for voting and the electronic means used for counting
 electronic voting praudyogiki main panch card, optical scan matdaan pranaliyaan or vishisht matdaan kiyosk matdaan pranali sahit) shaamil ho sakati hai
 This may include the transmission of ballots and polls via telephone, personal computer network, or the Internet
 electronic voting praudyogiki se matapatron kii ginati teji se ho sakati he or viklang matadaataaon ke liye behatar pahunch pradaan kar sakate hai
 However, this controversy exists, particularly in the United States that electronic voting, especially DRE voting, can facilitate electoral fraud
 matadaataaon ke liye electronic matdaan pranali kaa upyog 1960 ke dashak se hi prachlan main rahaa he, jab panch card pranali kaa shubharambh hua
 The new optical scan voting system allows computerized counting of the voter's signal on the ballot
