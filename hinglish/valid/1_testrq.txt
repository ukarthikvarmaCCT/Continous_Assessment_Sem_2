 Hamdy v
 Rumsfeld, 542 US
 In 507, the Supreme Court upheld the right of citizens of the United States to obtain the habeas corpus order, even when it was declared an enemy fighter
 hamadaan banaam ramsfeld 548 america 557, saleem ahamed hamadaan ne bandi pratyakshikaran ke pradesh ke liye ek yachika daayar kii, jisamen unhone chunauti di ki guantenamo be main kaidiyon par mukadmaa chalaae jane ke liye bush prashasan dwaara sthapit sainya ayog "uniform code of military justise or four geneva kanvension, donon kaa ulanghan karte hai
 "
 In an order of 5-3, the Supreme Court rejected attempts by Congress to restrict the jurisdiction of the courts on the habeas corpus appeal of the detainees of Guantanamo Bay
 The Congress previously approved the Department of Defense's Appropriation Act of 2006 Passed in which section 1005 stated, "procedures for the status review of prisoners outside the United States": 29 sitambar 2006 ko, sabha or seenet ne 65-34 vot se sainya ayog adhinium 2006 ko anumodith kar diya, ek vidheyak jo bandi pratyakshikaran ko kisi aise vyakti ke liye roak degaa jise "gaiyr-kanoonee shatru ladaaku" hona nirdhaarit kiya gaya he jo sanyukt rajya america ke khilaaf yuddh main shaamil tha yaa usne uskaa samarthan kiya tha
 "president Bush signed the Military Commission Act 2006 into law on 17 October 2006
 Declaring a person as an" unlawful enemy fighter "depends on the discretion of the US executive branch of the administration and the right of appeal there No, the result is that this effectively eliminates habeas corpus for any non-citizen
 MCA ke paarit hone par, is kanoon ne bhashaa ko "guantanamo be 


 videshi ko hiraasat main liya gaya" se badal diya: On February 20, 2007, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld this provision of the MCA in a 2–1 decision in the Bommedian v
 Bush case
 The Supreme Court refused to hear the acquittal's appeal and upheld the circuit court's decision
 On June 29, 2007, the US Supreme Court overturned its April 2007 ruling and agreed to hear Guantanamo's appeals to detainees seeking a habeas corpus for review
 MCA ke antargat, yah kanoon keval un videshiyon ke liye bandi pratyakshikaran apil ko pratibandhit karata he jinhen "shatru ladaaku" ke rup main niruddh kiya gaya he, yaa jo aise kisi nirdhaaran kii prakriya main hai
 The provision remains unchanged stating that after such determination it is subject to appeal in the US Court of Justice, including a review of whether the evidence justifies the determination
 yadi sthiti ko sahi tehraaya jaataa he, to unke karawas ko vaid samajha jaataa he
 However, there is no legal time limit that would compel the government to grant a Combatant Status Review Tribunal hearing
 Prior to the CSRT hearing, inmates are legally prohibited from petitioning in any court for any reason
 17 janvari 2007 ko, atorni general gonzalez ne seenet kii gavaahi main kaha ki jabaki bandi pratyakshikaran "hamaara sabase poshit adhikaar he," america samvidhan america nagarikon yaa nivaasiyon ko bandi pratyakshikaran adhikaron kii spasht guarantee nahin detaa he
 By the way, this law can be extended to US citizens and kept if left unchecked
 jaisaa ki robert peri ne balteemor chronical and centinal main likhte hai: Ironically, Gonzales may be wrong in another way about the lack of specificity in the Constitution's granting of habeas corpus rights
 Many of the legal features attributed to habeas corpus are delineated in a positive way in the Sixth Amendment 


 aaj kii taarikh tak, kam se kam ek aisa pusht maamla he jisamen gaiyr america nagarikon ko shatru ladaaku ke rup main galat vargeekrut kiya gaya
 On June 7, 2007, the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act 2007 was approved by the Senate by an 11–8 vote divided along party lines, with all except one Republican vote in support
 While the act reinstated statutory habeas corpus for enemy combatants, it did not overturn the provisions of the AEDPA that set limits on claims of habeas corpus on behalf of ordinary federal and state prisoners
 11 june 2007 ko ek sangheey apil adaalat ne faisla sunaaya ki ali saleh khalah al-maari, america kaa ek kanoonee nivasee, ko anishchit kaal tak hiraasat main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa he
 In a two-on-one decision of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Court held that the President of the United States did not have the legal authority to detain al-maari without charge; All three judges ruled that al-ma'ari deserves the traditional protection of habeas corpus that grants him the right to challenge his custody in a US court
 12 june 2008 ko, america supreme court ne bomedien banaam bush main 5-4 se faisla diya ki sanyukt rajya america dwaara guantanamo be bandi shivi main hiraasat main rakhe gaye sandigdh aatankwaadiyon ke paas america sangheey nyaayalay main bandi pratyakshikaran pradesh kii maang karne kaa adhikaar he
 In July 2008, the Richmond-based 4th Circuit Court ruled that: "if properly designated, an enemy fighter, pursuant to the President's legal authority, detained such persons for the duration of the relevant offense without charge or criminal proceeding can be placed
 " On October 7, 2008, Judge Ricardo M
 Urbina of the US District Court ruled that 17 Muslims from the northwestern Xinjiang region of Uyghur, China, would be brought to his court in Washington DC three days later: "because the Constitution is indefinite, without cause
" Restricts detention, ongoing detention is illegal
 " On January 21, 2009, US President Barack Obama issued an executive order regarding the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and the people detained there
 is aadesh main kaha gaya ki " paas bandi pratyakshikaran pradesh kaa sanvaidhanik visheshadhikaar he"
 a habeas corpus is an action usually taken after a conviction by a defendant who seeks relief for some alleged error in his criminal trial
 There are a number of post-trial actions and proceedings of this kind, whose differences are potentially confusing, so these require some clarification
 kuch sabase aam, ek apil hai jisamen prativaadee ko, utpreshnadesh pradesh, ek korum nobis pradesh or bandi pratyakshikaran pradesh, kaa adhikaar he
 An appeal, which the defendant possesses, cannot be summed up by a court which, by subscribing to its jurisdiction, is obliged to hear the appeal
 is tarah kii ek apil main, nivedankarta ko aisa mahasoos hota he ki uske mukademe main kuch truti rahi hogi jiske kaaran ek apil aavashyak he
 That premise is an issue of importance on which such an appeal can be filed: Generally as a matter of authority, appeals can only raise issues that were originally raised during the trial
 Any issue which was not originally raised in the case will not be considered in the appeal and will be considered as binding
 There is a convenient test to determine whether a petition is likely to succeed on the basis of errors
 To confirm that a mistake was actually made, an objection to that mistake was made by the lawyer and that the mistake led to the defendant's trial
 Negatively affected
 utpreshnadesh pradesh, aam taur par keval cert ke rup main janaa jane vaala, ucch adaalat dwaara diya gaya ek aadesh he jisamen nichali adaalat ko yah nirdesh diya jaataa he kii vah ek maamle ko record samiksha ke liye bheje or mukadmaa-pashchaat kii prakriya main yah aglaa tarksangat kadam he
 While similar procedures would occur in states, a ruling of certiorari is usually only issued by the Supreme Court in the United States, although some states maintain this process
 uparokt apil ke vipareet, cert kaa ek pradesh adhikaar kaa vishay nahin he
 a petition has to be filed for a state of certiorari, as the High Court issues such orders on a limited basis according to the bond such as time
 In another sense, the order of certs is like an appeal within its boundaries; In this also, relief can be sought on the grounds raised in the original lawsuit
 korum nobis pradesh ke liye ek yachika, maamle ke parinaam par nirnay-pashchaat kaa hamalaa he
 It is awarded in the lower court and claims that there were some mistakes that the court needs to set aside that judgment and / or sentence
 korum nobis pradesh kaa prayog ek adhikaar kshetra se duusare adhikaar kshetra main badalata rahata he
 However, in most jurisdictions it is limited to situations where a direct appeal was not possible before - usually because the issue was unknown at the time of appeal or because the issue could not otherwise be raised on appeal because of procedural constraints
 a common ground for quorum nobis petitions is a claim for incompetent assistance from a lawyer where the alleged disability is not shown on court records
 aise maamalon main, sidhi apil aam taur par asambhav he kyonki mahatvapurn ghatnaayen record par dikhaai nahin detii jahaan apiliy adaalat unhen dekh sakati he
 Thus, an accelerated quorum nobis petition may be an important tool for the defendant to use
 bandi pratyakshikaran pradesh, prativaadee ke liye apni galat sazaa ke khilaaf anutosh paane kaa aksar aakhri mauka hota he
 Habeas corpus can be used if a defendant is dissatisfied with the outcome of his appeal and is denied the order of certiorari, at which point he may petition in any of the various courts for the order of habeas corpus
 Can
 isamen bhi, inako adaalat ke vivek par diya jaataa he or ek yachika kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Like the order of appeal or cert, a habeas corpus order can reverse a defendant's wrongful conviction given some error in the original trial
 pramukh antar yah he ki bandi pratyakshikaran pradesh, ho saktaa he or kai baar aise muddon par dhyaan kendrit karta he jo mukademe kii mul seemaa se baahar hote hai, yani, aise mudde jinhen apil yaa cert pradesh dwaara nahin uthaaya ja sakaa
 ye aksar do tarksangat shreniyon ke antargat aate hai ki mukademe kaa vakil nishprabhavi yaa aksham tha yaa ki kuch sanvaidhanik adhikaar kaa ulanghan kiya gaya
 As a person progresses into post-trial actions, the relief becomes increasingly unlikely
 in karravaayiyon or unke upyog ke iraade ke bich matbhedon ko jaananaa, apane liye ek anukool faisla praapt karne kii sambhaavna ko badhaane main ek mahatvapurn saadhan he
 Therefore, the use of a lawyer is often a reasonable idea to help those who are trying to overcome a complex post-litigation scenario
 yah lekh sanskrit ke mahakavi bhaas kii rachana 'dootvaakya' ke bare main nahin he
 The Dootkavya is a typical tradition of Sanskrit poetry, beginning with the verses of Bhasa and Ghatkarpar and the Meghdoot of Mahakavi Kalidasa, however, its seeds appear to be much older
 parinishthit kaavyon main valmiki dwaara varnit vah prasang, jisen ram ne sita ke paas apana virah sandesh bheja, is parampara kii aadi kadi mana jaataa he
 Kalidas himself has also indicated in his "meghdoot" that he got the inspiration to make Megh the messenger from the Hanumanwala episode of Valmiki "ramayana"
 duusari or is parampara ke beej lokkavyon main bhi sthit jaan padate hai, jahaan virahi or virahiniyan apane apane prempatro ke pati bhramar, shuk, chatak, kaak aadi pakshiyon ke dwaara sandesh le jane kaa vinay karti milti hai
 There are only 22 verses available in the "ghatkarpar" poetry, in which a virahini has seen his viraha by looking at the cloud surrounded in the sky
 bhavanubhuti ke saath is kavy kii anyatam visheshta padaant yamak alankaar kaa prayog he
 In terms of style, this very short poem has also made a special place in Sanskrit literature and it is said that due to the beauty of this work, the poet challenged other poets that whichever poet would make a more excellent creation, the author His house is ready to be filled with water from the pitcher
 isi pratigya ke kaaran rachayita kii oopaadhi, "ghatkarper" ho gai or hamen uske vaastavik naam kaa pataa nahin chalata
 Some scholars consider this work to be Kalidasa's work, but it has been proved that it is not Kalidasa's work
 "ghatkarper" kaa samay anirnit he, vaise anushruthik parampara ke anusaar "ghatkarper" bhi vikramaditya ke navratnon main se ek the
 It can only be said that the composition of this poem is older than Kalidasa
 is parampara kii shashakt kriti mahakavi kalidas kaa "meghdoot" he, jisamen kuber ke dwaara ramagiri parvat par nirvasit yaksha, kamarth hokar, achetan megh ke madhyam se dur alakapuri main sthit apni priya ke paas yah sandesh bhejtaa he ki vah kisi tarah nirvaasan avadhi ke bache-khuche maheene or guzaar de or phir ve sharad kii chandani se dhuli raaton main apane saare armaan puure karenge hi
 Many Sanskrit poets have given important yoga in carrying forward the tradition of Dutkavya or Sandeshkavya
 is sambandh main sarvapratham bengal ke raja lakshmanasen ke darbari kavi kshamapati dhoyi kaa zikr karnaa aavashyak hoga
 After this, Sanskrit ambassadors can be divided into four traditions: praakrit tathaa apbhransh sahitya main kuch footkar gaathaayen or dohe kramash: haal or hemchandra ke mil jaayenge, jinamein kisi madhyam se vimukt pranayi ne apane priy ke paas kuch sandesh bhijwane kii cheshtaa kii he
 In the form of overall poetry, there is only one work in the literature of the Central Indian Aryabhasha, which falls in the tradition of Meghdoot and is the "sandeshrasak" of the Apabhramsa poet Udahmana
 12veen shatee main multan ke ek julahe addahamaan ne raasak geetikavyon kii style main ek kavy kii rachana kii jisamen virahinee nayika khambhaat jate hue kisi pathik se apane priy ke paas sandesh le jane ke liye prarthana karti he
 In addition to the beautification of the heroine in this poem, there is a delightful story narration and poignant expression of the heroism of the heroine
 hindi main "dhola maaru raa duha" main kuch dohe aise hai, jinka swaroop dootkavy style kaa he
 Apart from this, such places are available in Hindi premeditated poetry, where Virhi Prannayi has tried to send a message to his beloved by some means
 is sambandh main jaaysi ke "naagmativirah varnan" main uplabdh kuch sthalon kaa sanket kiya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, under the Bhramargeet tradition in Hindi Krishnakavya, some seeds of Dutkavya or Sandeshkavya will be found

 bartanon main bhojan karne kii reeti baad main chali
 Even today banana leaves are used in the banquet
 kerala kaa bhojan sanskaar yug-yugon se roopayit hua he
 The effect of socio-economic, political and agrarian elements is targeted on him
 yadhyapi kerala main chaaval kii krishi kaa prarambh hue kai shatabdiyaan biit gayi hai tathaapi chaaval ko sabhi logon ke khaadya padaarth bane bahut samay nahin hua
 The main reason for this was caste system
 ucchvarg ke namputiri, anpalavasi, nair aadi chaaval khate the
 Namputiri and Amplasi were vegetarians
 nair or avarna jati ke log maansaahaari the
 In the 19th century, the common people of Kerala used to eat twice a day
 itihaaskaaron kaa kahana he ki nair or avarna jati ke vipann logon main chaaval khaane kii aadat kam thi
 The common people cooked and ate millet, ragi, oats peas etc
 jabaki namputiri log acha bhojan karte the
 Upper caste people like Brahmins had a lot of opportunity to eat the feast
 mandiron ke prasad evam raajaaon or zamindaaron dwaara yojit 'uttukal' naamak pritibhoj par akele brahmanon kaa hi adhikaar tha
 The development of the food hierarchy and cooking of Kerala was developed by connecting with the caste system
 prayek jati evam dharm ke logon kii apni khaadya vastuen evam paak kalaayen hua karti thim
 In Kerala on the 19th wedding, 'putu' was the food of the Ishava caste
 khaadya padaarthon ko bhojya or abhojya naam se vibhakt kiya gaya tha
 This continued until the first decade of the 20th century in ancient Kerala
 usee prakaar bhojan kii reetiyaan, bhojan se jude vrath khaadya - padaarthon main grahya - tyajya aadi bhojan sanskaar ke itihaas kaa avibhajya ang he
 There were many restrictions in the Kerala society about food which were prevalent among the Brahmins and other upper castes
 aaj bhi keraly samaaj main chote paimaane par ye pratibandh jari he
 Eating is prohibited at midnight, noon, morning and evening
 vaise hi bhiige kapadey pahanakar bhojan karnaa, jharokhe main baithkar bhojan karnaa, kisi kii god main baithkar bhojan karnaa, nange hokar tathaa dharti ke sparsh ke bina bhojan karnaa, haath main rakhkar khaanaa khaanaa, ghar ke baahar baithkar bhojan karnaa aadi manaa he
 Do not eat at the time of eclipse
 raat main dahi nahin khaanaa chahie
 Do not drink milk during the day
 mata-pita ke khaane se pehle nahin khaanaa chahie
 One should not eat without completing the work that has to be done
 yah sab keraly brahmanon par lagaae gaye niyam he
 The following rules related to food are stated in the book, Shankara Smriti, written by Shankaracharya
 yahi shaakaahaari brahman anjaane main maance khayega to use praayshchitt karnaa chahie
 One who eats meat deliberately should be thrown out of the caste
 isi prakaar snaan ke baad hi khaanaa bananaa, thanda chaaval na khaanaa, bacchon kii juuthan ko chhodna, haath se chaaval na parosna aadi pratibandh bhi prachlit the
 Nampurtis were forbidden to eat onions
 keraly samaaj main baayein haath se khaanaa aaj bhi bura mana jaataa he
 In the context of food in ancient Kerala, caste-related rule was followed
 yah vibhaajan keval bhojya vastuon ko lekar hi nahin, pritibhojon main bhi lagu hota tha
 The anti-caste movement in the early decades of the 20th century and the powerful Navothan movement ended this division
 jati vyavastha ke ucch shikhar par virajman namputiri log is vibhaajan ke janak the
 The subcastes also had this distinction
 isamen sabase pramukh bhed-bhav saath khaane ke liye hota tha
 Only certain people can eat certain foods
 brahmanon ke saath baithkar khaane kaa adhikaar kisi duusare ko nahin tha
 They did not sit and dine with people belonging to lower castes than themselves
 baad main kerala ne iske khilaaf 'pankti bhojan' naamak abhiyaan chalaaya
 The Namputiri community itself had various sub-castes
 ve saath main baithkar bhojan nahin kar sakate the
 If someone dined against the ethos, he would be out of the community
 yadi achhut jati kaa bhojan unchi jati kaa aadmi karata to jati se baahar ho jaataa tha
 In the 19th century Namputiri people did not eat ‘putu’ as it was considered the food of the gods
 vishesh prakaar kaa kelaa namputiri hi kha sakate the
 In old Kerala, the woman was not allowed to dine with her husband
 vaise hi avarna jati ke logon ko duukaan yaa bazaar se khaadya padaarth kharidne kii anumati nahin thi
 They could not even buy salt
 avarnon ko gaay ko paalane yaa duhakar doodh lene kii izaazat nahin thi
 In the 19th century, milk and milk products were reserved for the upper castes in Kerala
 kerala ke bhojan - sanskaar kaa hi hissaa he upwas
 The aim of controlling food was health protection
 savarna jati ke log upwaason kaa anushthan karte the
 The ritual of fasting continues in Kerala even today
 upwas hi bhojan-vrath kaa aadhaar he
 Although every fast is done for the sake of health protection, it has been given place as a religious ritual
 prayek maas kii ekadshi, shukla paksh or shwet paksh, maas kaa pratham shanivaar, shravan maas kii chaturthi, sakranti, ashtami rohinee, shivaratri aadi dinon main vrath kaa anushthan hota tha
 Mon-fast is the fast of women
 vrath kai prakaar ke hote hai kisi-kisi main chaaval nahin khaaya jaataa, pani tak na piya jaataa, raatri-bhojan nahin kiya jaataa
 Fasting is not eaten throughout the day, fasting, which does not eat from noon to noon on the second day is called Ekkantam
 krichhram, paraakan, chandrayanam, maasavasar ityadi kai duusare upwas sampradaay prachlit rahe hai
 Mirza asad-ullah Beg Khan aka "ghalib" was a great poet of Urdu and Persian language
 inako urdu bhashaa kaa sarvakalik mahaan shaayar mana jaataa he or farsi kavita ke pravaah ko hindustani jabaan main lokapriy karwaane kaa shrey bhi inako diya jaataa he
 However, in earlier years, Mir Taki "mir" is also known for this reason
 gaalib ke likhe patr, jo us samay prakashit nahin hue the, ko bhi urdu lekhan kaa mahatvapurn dastauez mana jaataa he
 Ghalib is known as an important poet in India and Pakistan
 unhe dabeer-ul-mulk or nazm-ud-daula kaa khitaab mila
 Mirza, who wrote Ghalib, was also a court poet of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last ruler of the Mughal period
 agra, dilli or kalakatta main apni zindagi gujaarne vaale gaalib ko mukhyatah unki urdu gazalon ko liye yaad kiya jaataa he
 He wrote about himself that there are many good poets and poets in the world, but his style is most unique: haalanki gaalib ko aupchaarik shiksha nahin mili, lekin unhone mullah abdushamaad se arabi, farsi, tark or darshan main apane sabak siikhe or bauddhik str par apane aap main vruddhi kii
 After the demise of Sheikh Ibrahim Jauk, who had the privilege of advising Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar on his poetry, he was appointed as his advisor, as well as the historian of the Mughal court, “hai or bhi duniya main sukhnvar bahut achchhekahate hai ki gaalib kaa he andaaz-e bayaan or” Ghalib was born in Agra into a family with a military background
 unhone apane pita or chachaa ko bachapan main hi kho diya tha, gaalib kaa jeevanyaapan mulat: apane chachaa ke maranoparant milane vaale pension se hota tha 
 Ghalib had a background from an Ottoman family and his grandfather came to India from Samarkand in Central Asia around 1750

 Mirza Abdullah Beg Khan and Mirza Nasrullah Beg Khan had two sons
 mirza abdulla beg ne izzat-ut-nisa begum se nikaah kiya or apane sasur ke ghar main rahane lage
 He worked first with the Nawab of Lucknow and later with the Nizam of Hyderabad
 1803 main alvar main ek yuddh main unki mrityu ke samay gaalib maatr 5 varsh ke the
 When Ghalib was younger, a neo-muslim-turned-politician came to Delhi from Iran and Ghalib learned Persian by staying in his company
 gaalib kii praarambhik shiksha ke bare main spashtatah kuch kaha nahin ja saktaa lekin gaalib ke anusaar unhone 11 varsh kii avasthaa se hi urdu evam farsi main gadhy tathaa padya likhane armbh kar diya tha
 He wrote compositions mostly in Persian and Urdu on traditional devotional and aesthetic rasa which is written in Ghazal
 unhone farsi or urdu dono main paaramparik geet kavy kii rahasyamay-romantic style main sabase vyapak rup se likhaa or yah ghazal ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 At the age of 13, he was married to Umrao Begum, daughter of Nawab Elahi Bakhsh
 vivaah ke baad vah dilli aa gayi the jahaan unki tamaam umr beeti
 In connection with his pension, he had to travel for a long trip to Kolkata, which is mentioned in his ghazals from place to place
 1850 main shahenshaah bahadur shah zafar dwitiya ne mirza gaalib ko dabeer-ul-mulk or nazm-ud-daula ke khitaab se nawaaza
 Later he also got the title of Mirza Nosha

 The theory of broken windows is an ideology of criminology according to which chaos in cities gives anti-social elements and criminals morale for wrongdoing and increases crime
 yah siddhant kahata he ki agar shahar ko suvyavasthit or saafe-suthra rakhaa jaae to jurm bhi kam hone lagate hai
 Broken window theory was first described in an article by sociologists James Wilson and George Kalling in an American magazine called 'atlantic Masika' in March 1982
 unhone iskaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha - The basic argument of this theory is that antisocial behavior should be stopped only when it appears in a small form
 agar tuuti khidkiyaan foran thik kar di jaaen to asaamaajik niyat rakhane waalon ko sanket miltaa he ki is samaaj main dushavyavhaar or kuvyavastha bardaasht nahin kiya jaataa isliye unhen apni hadon main rahanaa chahie
 If the streets are cleaned daily then people also waste less on them
 1970 or 1980 ke dashakon main new york main bahut hinsaatmak jurm hote the
 There was an atmosphere of fear among the people
 rail yatayaat is shahar ke rozmarra jivan kaa mahatvapurn hissaa he or relon par bhi aksar gundgardee ke haadase hote the
 In 1985, George Calling was appointed an advisor by the New York Municipal Traffic Authority
 us samay is shahar ke railway steshnon kii deevaaron par or rail ke dabbon ke andar asaamaajik logon ne tarah-tarah kii chizein likhi hui thi or aksar apane girohon se sambandhit naare yaa chitra banaae hote the
 Many people would even pee at unruly railway stations, or inside coaches
 1984 se 1990 tak in sabhi likhaaiyon ko jor lagaakar saafe kiya gaya
 In 1990, it was announced that no one would be allowed to go un-ticketed on the train, although people often boarded the rail without giving tickets
 us samay shahar kii police qatl or choriyon se nibatane main vyast thi
 Many people condemned this announcement and said that it is foolish to give the police one more less important job in the atmosphere of theft
 phir bhi shahar kii sarkaar dat gai or usne betikat yatriyon par sakht juramaana karnaa shuru kar diya
 In 2001, it was found that not only rail-related crimes were very low in New York but also the rate of murder and theft accident was very low
 agle das saalon tak shahar main jurm lagaataar kam hota gaya
 Public toilets are often dirty
 lekin kuch samaaj-shastriyon ne adhyayan karne par paaya he ki jo shauchalay pehle se saafe hon unhen prayog karne vaale bhi kam ganda karte hai
 That is, the toilets that are cleaned up a little when they get dirty need to be cleaned less often because the users get a hint that it is not acceptable to mess them up
 ek internet protocol adress ek sankhyatmak label he jo apane nodes ke bich sanchaar ke liye internet protocol kaa prayog karanevaale computer network main bhaag le rahe divices ko abantit kiya jaataa he
 An IP address performs two major functions: host or network interface identification and location detection
 The characterization of its role is as follows: “A name indicates what we ask for
 ek pataa ingit karata he ki vah kahan he
 a route indicates how to get there
 " TCP / IP ke diziner ne IP adress ko ek 32-bit nambar ke rup main paribhaashit kiya or internet protocal varjan 4 yaa ipv4 ke naam se jaani janevaali yah pranali, aaj bhi upyog main he
 However, due to the extensive development of the Internet and consequently the lack of available addresses, a new detection system using 128 bits for addresses was developed in 1995 and last standardized by RFC 2460 in 1998
 haalanki IP adress dwiadhari sankhya ke rup main jamaa kiye jate he, vah aamtaur par maanviya-pathyogy chihnkaree jaise 208

166 or 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:1:1 main pradarshit kiye jate hai
 The Internet protocol also sends data packets between networks; The IP address specifies the location of the source and destination nodes in the topology of the routing system
 is prayojan ke liye, ek IP adress ke kuch bits ek sab-network abhinihit karne ke liye istemaal kiye jate hai
 The number of these bits is indicated in CIDR notation, appended to the IP address, such as 208
77
188
166 / 24
 jaise hi nijee network ke vikaas ne ipv4 adress ke samaapan ke khatre ko uthaaya, RFC 1918 ne nijee adress sthaan kaa ek samooh nirdhaarit kiya jo nijee network par kisi ke bhi dwaara istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 They are often used with network address translators to connect to the global public Internet
 da internet asind number athurity, jo saarvbhaumik IP adress sthaan niyatan prabandh karata he, sthaneey internet registry or anya sansthaaon ko IP khand aabantan karne ke liye, paanch kshetreey internet registry ko sahyog detaa he
 Two versions of the Internet protocol are in use: IP version 4 and IP version 6
 See version history
) Each version defines an IP address differently
 uski vyapaktaa ke kaaran, saamaanya shabd ypi adress aam taur par ab bhi ipv4 dwaara paribhaashit adress ko sanderbhit karata he
 ipv4 uses a 32-bit address, which limits the address space to 4,294,967,296) possible unique addresses
 ipv4 kuch adress, vishesh prayojanon jaise nijee network yaa bahustrpiya adress ke liye arakshit karata he
 This reduces the number of addresses to be assigned to end-users and as the number of available addresses decays, ipv4 address completion becomes fixed
 yah purvaabhaasi kami ipv6 viksit karne ke liye praathmik prerana thi, jo duniya bhar main vibhinn tainaati charnon main he or ipv4 pratisthaapan or internet ke lagaataar vistaar ke liye akeli ranneeti he
 ipv4 addresses are usually represented in dot-decimal notation
 prayek bhaag adress ke 8 bit kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or isliye ocotate kahalaaya jaataa he
 In less common cases of technical writing, ipv4 addresses can be presented in hexadecimal, octal, or binary representations
 sarvaadhik pratinidhitiv main prayek ocotate vyaktigat rup se badla jaataa he
 In the initial phase of Internet Protocol development, network administrators described the IP address in two parts, the network number portion and the host number portion
 The highest order octet in an address was designated a network number, and the remaining bits were called rest fields or host identifiers and were used for internal host numbering of the network
 yah paddati jald hi annuroop sabit hui jaise hi atirikt network viksit hue jo maujuuda network se svachhand the, jinhen pehle se hi ek network sankhya dwaara abhinihit kiya hota tha
 In 1981, the Internet addressing specification was revised with the inclusion of a classful network structure
 classphul network dizine ek badi sankhya ke liye vyaktigat network kaary kii anumati detaa tha
 The first three bits of the most important octet of an IP address were defined as a range of addresses
 saarvbhaumik unicast parichayan ke liye teen shreneeyaan paribhaashit kii gai
 Network identification based on derived class was based on octet boundary areas of the entire address
 prayek shrenee network pahachanakarta main kramshah atirikt octate kaa upyog karti thi, is prakaar se ucch varg shrenee main sambhav mejabaanon kii sankhya kam ho jaati he
 The following table gives an overview of the system thus obsolete
 'sabanetwork' or 'classphul network' lekh main is abhikalp kaa vivaran samajhaayaa gaya he
 Although the classful network design was a successful developmental stage, wild Internet expansion made it difficult to move forward and when classless inter-domain routing was created to provide new IP address segments and use ipv4 addresses for routing protocols
 When new rules were prepared for, it was dropped
 swecchit-lambaai upsargon kaa aabantan evam anumaargan karwaane ke liye siidiar veriable-lenth sabanet masking par aadhaarit he
 Today, the residuals of the classful network concept operate only in a limited area, which is the default configuration parameter of some network software and hardware components and is used in technical discussions of network administrators
 aarambhik network abhikalp main jab sanchaar ke liye sabhi internet prayogkartaaon ke bich vaishvik str par ek chaur se duusare chaur tak jodne kii baat sochi gai to yah lakshya tha ki prayek computer yaa upkaran kaa ek vishisht ypi pataa ho
 But it was found that it is not always possible to do so as private networks developed and public addresses needed to be conserved
 jo computer internet se nahin jude hai, jaise ki kaarkaane kii mashine jo tisipi / ypi ke madhyam se keval aapas main sanchaar karti hai, unke liye vaishvik taur par vishisht ypi pataa hona jaruri nahin he
 For private networks three of the ipv4 addresses, one limit for each class, were reserved in the 1918 RFC
 in paton kaa margan internet par nahin kiya jaataa or isliye inkaa prayog ypi paton kii panji ke saath samanvit karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Today, when needed, such private networks usually connect to the Internet through network address translation
 koi bhi upyogkarta kisi bhi arakshit blaak kaa upyog kar sakate hai
 Typically, a network administrator splits a segment into subnets, for example, many home enrollers automatically use a left address range of 192

 ypi sanskaran 4 pate kaa sthaan teji se apane aadhikarik taur par uplabdh abantit pate ke khandon ke samaapan par pahunch rahaa he
 Despite the preservation techniques, the rapid completion of the ipv4 address space prompted the Internet Engineering Task Force to explore new technologies to expand the Internet's addressing capabilities
 iskaa sthaayee samaadhaan, internet protocol kaa hi ek nayaa swaroop, samajha tha
 This next generation of Internet Protocol, intended to replace ipv4 on the Internet, was eventually renamed Internet Protocol version 6 in 1995
 pataa aakaar 32 se badha kar 128 bit yaa 16 ocotate kar diya gaya, jo, network block ke ek udaar kaam ke saath bhi, nikat bhavishya ke liye paryaapt mana jaataa he
 Mathematically, the new address space provides a capacity of up to 2, or approximately 3
403 × 10 unique addresses
 nayaa dizin keval adress kii paryaapt maatra pradaan karne ke lakshya par aadhaar nahin he, balki sabanet anumaargan upsargon ke kushal ekatrikaran ko anumaargan nodes par hone kii anumati dene ke liye
 As a result, the routing table size is small and the smallest possible individual allocation is a subnet for 264 hosts, which is square of the size of the entire ipv4 Internet
 in staron par, vaastavik adress upyog dar kisi bhi ipv6 network khand par chota hoga
 The new design also provides the opportunity to isolate the addressing infrastructure of a network segment — which is the local administration of the segment's available space — from an addressing prefix used to route external traffic to a network
 ipv6 main aisi suvidhaayen he jo, yadi vaishvik sampark yaa anumaargan niti main parivartan ho, to bina aantarik nae swaroop yaa nae sankhyankan ke swatah hi puure network kaa anumaargan upsarg badal detii hai
 The large number of ipv6 addresses allows large blocks to be specified for specific purposes and, where appropriate, to be aggregated for efficient routing
 ek bade adress sthaan ke saath ek jatil pataa sangrakshan takanic kii jarurat nahin hoti, jaise clasles inter-domen rooting main upyog kii jaati he
 According to Submodern, desktop and enterprise server operating systems include seamless support for the ipv6 protocol, but are not yet widely deployed in other devices such as home networking routers, voice over internet protocols, and multimedia devices and network peripherals
 ek ipv6 pate kaa udhaaharan: As ipv4 reserves addresses for private or internal networks, ipv6 has separate sets of addresses for private addresses
 ipv6 main, in ko unic local adress ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 RFC 4,193 sets the routing prefix fc00 :: / 7 separately for this department, which is divided into two / 8 departments with different available policies
 The address includes a 40-bit pseudorandom number of site mergers or packets
 Addresses on the wrong route reduce the risk of encounter
 aarambhik dizin is prayojan ke liye ek alag khand kaa prayog karte the, dabd site-sthaneey adress
 haalanki, site kaa gathan kis se hota he, isaki paribhaasha aspasht rahi or kharaab paribhaashit parichayan niti ne anumaargan main sandigdhta bana di
 The address range specification has been abandoned and should no longer be used in the new system
 fe80 se shuru hote pate: - link-local adress kahalaaye jane vaale - keval sthaneey link kshetra main niyat kiye jate hai
 Addresses are usually generated automatically by the IP layer of the operating system for each network interface
 yah kisi bhi ipv6 mejabaan ke liye tatkaal swat: network sanyojaktaa pradaan karata he or iskaa matlab he ki yadi kai mejabaan ek aam hub yaa switch se judate hai to unke link sthaneey ipv6 adress dwaara unhen ek sheeghra sanchaar maarg miltaa he
 This feature is used extensively and indirectly for most users in the lower layers of ipv6 network administration
 saarvajanik internet main koi bhi nijee adress upsarg nahin bheja ja saktaa
 The technique of subnetting can work in both ipv4 and ipv6 networks
 ypi adress do bhaagon main vibhajit he: network adress or host idantifire 
 sabanet mask yaa CIDR upsarg nirdhaarit karata he ki kaise IP adress network or host bhaagon main vibhajit he
 The term subnet mask is only used in ipv4
 halanki donon ypi sanskaran, classles inter-domen rooting kii avadharana or sanketan kaa upyog karte hai
 In this, there is a slash behind the IP address and the number of bits used for the network part, also called the route prefix
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek ipv4 adress or uskaa sabanet mask kramshah 192
0

1 or 255
255
255
0 ho saktaa he
 The CIDR notation for the same IP address and subnet mask is 192

1 / 24, as the first 24 bits of the IP address encode the network and subnet
 jab ek computer har baar ek hi ai pi adress kaa prayog karne ke liye samanurup kiya jaataa he to vah tej ho jaataa he, ise static IP adress kehete hai
 Conversely, in cases when the computer's IP address is assigned automatically, it is known as a dynamic IP address
 static IP adress ek vyavasthaapak dwaara haath se computer ko saunpa he
 Its exact process varies by platform
 yah dinemic ai pi adress se asaadrishy hai, jo yaa to computer interphes yaa swayam host software, jaise xeronkonf main, dwaara nirdisht hote he yaa dinemic host kanfigreshna protocol ke istemaal se ek sarwar dwaara nirdisht kiye hote he
 Although IP addresses specified using DHCP remain the same for long periods of time, they can usually change
 kuch maamalon main, ek network vyavasthaapak sakriy rup se nirdisht static IP adress lagu kar saktaa hai
 In this case, a DHCP server is used, but it is specifically tailored to always assign the same IP address to a specific computer
 yah static IP adress ko mukhya rup se samanurup hone kii anumati detaa he, jisamen network par prayek computer ko hastchalit pranali dwaara vishesh rup se samanurup karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati
 In the absence or failure of a static or stateful address configuration, an operational system can assign an IP address to a network interface using state-less automatic-configuration techniques, such as Xeroconf
 gatisheel ypi pate dinemic host kanfigareshan protocol sarvaron dwaara atyadhik praayah lans or broadband network par niyukt hote hai
 They are used because they can avoid the administrative burden of assigning specific static addresses for each device on a network
 yah kai upkarnon ko ek network par simit adress sthaan main sahabhaagi banane kii anumati bhi detaa he, par keval yadi un main se kuch kisi vishesh samay par online hon
 kai vartmaan desktop oparating system main, gatisheel ypi vinyas difolt rup se sakasham kiya hota he taaki ek upyogkarta ko DHCP sarwar ke saath ek network se judane ke liye apane haath se koi settings darj karne kii aavashyaktaa naa pade
 gatisheel IP adress nirdisht karne ke liye DHCP hi akeli takanic nahin he
 Dialup and some broadband networks use dynamic address characteristics of point-to-point protocols
 ek stick dinemic IP adress yaa stick ypi cabel or DSL internet adhigam bhugtankarta dwaara ek gatyaatmakataa se niyukt ypi adress jisamen aksar badlaav nahin aata, uskaa varnan karne ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Addresses are usually assigned with the DHCP protocol
 chunki modem aamtaur par vistaarit avadhi ke samay ke liye yantrachaalit hote hai, isliye adress patte aksar lambey samay ke liye niyamit kiye jate hai or samaapti hone par naveekrut kar die jate hai
 If a modem is turned off and the address is re-operated before the next termination of the lease, it is most likely that it will receive the same IP address
 RFC 3330 ipv4 networkon ke liye sthaneey-link adressing main vishesh upyog karne ke liye adress block, 169
254
0
0 / 16, paribhaashit karata he
 In ipv6, each interface using static or dynamic address functions automatically receives a local-link address in the fe80 :: / 10 subnet
 ye adress keval link par vaid hote hai, jaise ek sthaneey network khand yaa binduvaar conection jisase koi host judaa hua ho
 These addresses are not routable and cannot be the source or destination of Internet packet blocking like private addresses
 jab sthaneey-link ipv4 adress block arakshit hua tha, adress swachaalit-samakriti ke tantra ke liye koi bhi maanak astitv main nahin tha
 Filling the void, Microsoft created an implementation called automatic private IP addressing
 microsoft kii vipanan kshamta ke kaaran APIPA ko lakhon mashiinon par tainaat kiya gaya he or, is prakaar yah udyog main ek vaastavik maanak ban gaya he
 Many years later, the IETF defined a formal standard for this functionality, RFC 3927, as the official configuration of the local-link address ipv4
 kuch buniyadi dhaanchon ko sthitik adress upyog karnaa aavashyak he, jaise ki domen naam pranali kaa host praapt karne par jo domen naam ko IP adress main badal detaa he
 Static address is also convenient to set up a server in an enterprise, but not at all necessary

 Just as a telephone number may have a site-specific extension, port numbers are a site-specific extension for an IP address
 chote gharelu network main, NAT kaary aam taur par ek awasaiya pravesh-dwaar divaais main hote hai, vishisht rup se ek "router" ke rup main bechaa jaataa he
 In this scenario, the computer connected to the router will have a 'private' IP address and the router will have a government address to communicate with the Internet
 is prakaar kaa router, kai computer ko ek saarvajanik ai pi pataa baantne kii anumati detaa he

 uskaa koi mitra nahin he va uski umr ke bachche uske saath galat vyavhaar karte hai
 Abby, a girl in her neighborhood, comes to live with her father and the two slowly become friends
 parantu oven ko baad main pataa chalata he ki abi ek vaimpire he or uski umr rukii hui he, matlab vah kai varshon se 12 varsh kii hi he
 Abby can enter someone else's house only by invitation and if she comes into someone's house without invitation then blood starts leaking from place to place in her body
 abi jinda rahane ke liye insaanon kaa khun piti he or jo aadmi uske saath rahata he vah uskaa pita nahin apitu oven kii tarah hi kai varsh pehle uskaa bana ek mitra he
 That man kills humans for Abby
 jab aise hi ek prakaran main police use pakad leti he to vah abi ko bachaane ke liye apane chahare par tezaab fek letaa he jisase uski vaastaviktaa kisi ko pataa na chal sake or baad main aspataal ke andar abi se antim vidaa lene ke baad kamare kii khidki se kud ke aatmahatya kar letaa he

 The meaning of health is different for different people
 lekin agar ham ek saarvbhaumik drushtikon kii baat karen to apane aapako swasth kehane kaa yah arth hota he ki ham apane jivan main aanevaali sabhi saamaajik, shaareerik or bhaavnaatmak chunautiyon kaa prabandhan karne main safaltaapurvak sakasham hon
 Although in today's time, a lot of modern technology has been present to keep yourself healthy, but all these are not as effective
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke anusaar, swasthya sirf rog yaa durbalata kii anupasthiti hi nahin balki ek purna shaareerik, maansik or saamaajik khushhaali kii sthiti he
 Healthy people are able to cope with everyday activities and adapt themselves to any environment
 rog kii anupasthiti ek vaanchhneeya sthiti he lekin yah swasthya ko purnataya paribhaashit nahin karata he
 It is not a criterion for health and cannot be considered sufficient for health building alone
 lekin swasth hone kaa vaastavik arth apane aap par dhyaan kendrit karte hue jivan jeene ke swasth tareekon ko apanaaya janaa he
 If we desire an integral personality then we should always be happy and also keep in mind that the dimensions of health are like different pieces

 It is a common condition of a person taking into account all aspects
 yah ek jeev ke kaaryaatmak or / yaa chayapachay kshamta kaa ek str bhi he
 Following are some ways to ensure good physical health- maansik swasthya kaa arth hamaare bhaavnaatmak or aadhyatmik lacheelepan se he jo hamen apane jivan main dard, niraashaa or udaasi kii sthitiyon main jivit rahane ke liye sakasham banaati he
 Mental health is the ability to express our feelings and adapt to the many demands of life
 ise acha banaae rakhane ke nimnlikhit kuch tareeke hai- It is the cognitive ability to develop skills and knowledge to enhance one's life
 hamaari bauddhik kshamta hamaari rachanaatmakataa ko protsaahit or hamaare nirnay lene kii kshamta main sudhaar karne main madad karata he
 Our good health is incomplete without being spiritually healthy

 Therefore, we should think seriously about this essential item

 a person is said to be healthy when his body is healthy and mind is clean and calm

 The definition of healthy person in Ayurveda is given as follows- acharya charak ke anusaar swasthya kii paribhaasha- According to Kashyapamhita, the symptoms of health swasthya kii ayurveda sammat avadharana bahut vyapak he
 In Ayurveda, the state of health is called Prakriti and the state of unhealth or disease is called pathology
 chikitsak kaa kaary rogaatmak chakra main hastkshep karke prakritik santulan ko kaayam karnaa or uchit aahaar or aushadhi kii sahaayta se swasthya prakriya ko dubaara shuru karnaa he
 The function of medicine is to help nature to regain lost balance
 ayurvedic manishiyon ke anusaar upachaar swayan prakruti se prabhavit hota he, chikitsak or aushadhi is prakriya main sahaayta-bhar karte hai
 The laws of health depend on basic cosmic unity
 brahmad ek sakriy ikai he, jahaan prayek vastu nirantar parivartit hoti rahati he; kuch bhi akaaran or aksmaat nahin hota or prayek kaary kaa prayojan or uddeshy hua karata he
 Health can be defined as the harmony of one's self and its environment
 vikruti yaa rog hone kaa kaaran vyakti ke swa kaa brahmad ke niyamon se taal-mail na hona he
 The duty of Ayurveda is to maintain the natural balance of the body and to harmonize it with the rest of the world
 rog kii avasthaa main, iskaa kartavya upatantron ke vikaas ko rokane ke liye sheeghra hastkshep karnaa or deh ke santulan ko pun: sanchit karnaa he
 In the initial state, the disease elements are temporary and natural balance can be restored by simple practice
 yah sambhav he ki aap swayan ko swasth samajhate hon, kyonki aapkaa shaareerik rachanatantra thik dhang se kaary karata he, phir bhi aap vikruti kii avasthaa main ho sakate hai agar aap asantusht hon, sheeghra krodhit ho jate hon, chidchidapan yaa bechaini mahasoos karte hon, gahari neend na le pate hon, aasaani se farig na ho pate hon, ubaasiyaan bahut aati hon, yaa lagaataar hichakiyaan aati ho, ityadi

 Digestion of food is done and juice, blood, meat, fattening, bone, marrow and Venus are properly formed of these seven metals

 Explaining the measures to protect health, Ayurveda says- arthath sharir or swasthya ko sthir, sudrudh or uttam banaaye rakhane ke liye aahaar, swapn or brahmacharya - ye teen upastambh hai
 'up' means assistant and 'pillar' means pillar
 in teenon up stambhon kaa yatha vidhi seven karne se hi sharir or swasthya kii raksha hoti he
 Along with this, the reasons that make the body sick are also discussed, namely- arthath dhi, dhruthi or smriti ke bhrasht ho jane par manushya jab ashubh karm karata he tab sabhi shaareerik or maansik dosha prakupit ho jate hai
 These evil deeds are called 'pragyaapradha'
 jo pragyaparaadh karegaa uske sharir or swasthya kii haani hogi or vah rogagrast ho hi jayega
 The modern approach to health care is contrary to the holistic approach of Ayurveda; Based on individual rules and completely divided
 isamen maanav-sharir kii tulana ek aisi mashin ke rup main kii gai he jiske alag-alag bhaagon kaa vishleshan kiya ja saktaa he
 The disease is seen as a defect in any part of the machine of the body
 deh kii vibhinn prakriyaaon ko jaivikeey or aanvik staron par samajha jaataa he or upachaar ke liye, deh or maanas ko do alag-alag satta ke rup main dekha jaataa he

 The oldest book of this information is also known as Natyashastra, the author of which was Bharata Muni
 bharat muni kaa jeevankaal 400 isapurv se 100 i ke madhya kisi samay mana jaataa he
 Bharatamuni's Natya Shastra is still highly respected as a complete book of music, drama and acting
