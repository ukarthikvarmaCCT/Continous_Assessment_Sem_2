 Bhakti Rasa is considered to be the 11th Rasa
 This rasa has been established in the scripture "bhakti Rasa- Pahla Rasa or Eleventh Rasa" written by Vivek Sahni
 
 In the Natyasastra, Bharata Muni, while explaining Rasa, has said - arthath vibhaav, anubhav, vyabhichaari bhav ke sanyog se ras kii nishpatti hoti he
 It is said in the well-known literature mirror that when the permanent sense of the heart attains a combination of affect, feeling and communicable feeling, it disappears in the form of rasa
 reetikaal ke pramukh kavi dev ne ras kii paribhaasha in shabdon main kii he : Thus there are four parts of rasa - Permanent feeling, Vibhava, Anubhav and communicative feeling
 bhav kaa arth he:-hona In the conscience of the heart, the psyche which is always present in the form of lust or sanskar and which no opponent or antagonist can suppress, is called permanent emotion
 ye maanav man main beej rup main, chirkaal tak achanchal hokar nivas karte hai
 These represent the sacrament or spirit
 ye sabhi manushyon main usee prakaar chhipe rahete hai jaise mitti main gandh avichhinn rup main samaai rahati he
 They are so capable that they merge with other emotions
 inaki sankhya 11 he - rati, haas, shok, utsaah, krodh, bhay, jugupsa, vismay, nirved, vatsaltaur ishwar vishyak prem
 Vibhava means reason
 ye sthaayee bhaavon kaa vibhaavan / udbodhan karte hai, unhen aswaad yogya banaate hai
 These are considered fundamental in the origin of juice
 vibhaav ke do bhed hai: The main emotion or object due to which the emotion originates is called poetic reception
 alamban ke antargat aate hai vishay or aashray
 The character towards which a character's feelings are awakened is the subject
 sahitya shaastra main is vishay ko alamban vibhaav athwa 'alamban' kehete hai
 The character in which the emotions are awakened is called the shelter
 sthaayee bhav ko jaagrath rakhane main sahaayak kaaran uddipan vibhaav kehalaate hai
 As an example, the enemy standing standing in front of the zeal of Veer Ras is enthusiasm
 shatru ke saath sena, yuddh ke baaje or shatru kii darpoktiyaan, garjana-tarjana, shastr sanchaalan aadi uddipan vibhaav hai
 There are two types of stimulus effects: arthath alamban kii uktiyaan or cheshthaayen That is, objects related to the environment
 prakritik drishyon kii gananaa bhi inhen ke anrtgat hoti hai
 The gestures of shelter that illuminate or convey permanent expressions like Rati, Haas, Mourning etc
 are called Anubhav
 ye cheshtaaen bhav-jagriti ke uparaant aashray main utpann hoti hai isliye inhen anubhav kehete hai, arthath jo bhaavon kaa anugaman kare vah anubhav kehalaata he
 Anubhav has two distinctions - the intended and the unwilling
 alamban evam uddipan ke madhyam se apane-apane kaarnon dwaara utpann, bhaavon ko baahar prakashit karne vaali saamaanya lok main jo kaary cheshtaaen hoti hai, ve hi kavy naatak aadi main nibaddh anubhav kehalaati hai
 For example, filling the sighs by the Viraha-distraught hero, watching with tears, sweat, thrill, affection in the spirit of union, handling of arms when awakened, harsh speech, red eyes, etc
 will be called Anubhav
 saadhaaran anubhav : arthath ke chaar bhed hai

 Satvik
 aashray kii sharir sambandhi cheshtaaen angik yaa kayik anubhav he
 Earthly deflection, sarcasm etc
 are the rhetorical rhetorical experiences when the Rati Bhava is awake
 aropit yaa kritrim vesh-rachana aharya anubhav he
 But, in the wake of permanent feeling, natural, unnatural, ayatnaj, angvikar are called satvik experiences
 iske liye aashray ko koi bahya cheshtaa nahin kerani padati
 Hence they are called Ayatnaj
 ye swat: pradurbhoot hote hai or inhen roka nahin ja saktaa
 Satvik Anubhav: meaning there are eight distinctions - pillar, Sveda, thrill, Swarbhang, Vepathu, Vaivarnya, Tear and Pralaya
 jo bhav keval thodi der ke liye sthaayee bhav ko pusht karne ke nimitt sahaayak rup main aate hai or turant lupt ho jate hai, ve sanchari bhav hai
 The word sanchari means, to walk together, that is, to be transitive, communicable emotions are transmitted with a permanent emotion, they are capable enough that they can move in harmony with each permanent emotion
 isliye inhen vyabhichaari bhav bhi kaha jaataa he
 The number of communicable or adulterous expressions is considered 33 - Nirveda, guilt, doubt, Asuya, item, labor, laziness, lowliness, anxiety, fascination, memory, dhriti, vriada, chatliya, joy, impulse, inertia, pride, grief, sadness , Sleep, aphasma, dream, prabodh, amarsha, avhitha, raging, mati, disease, hysteria, death, tragedy and disarray
 bharatmuni ne kavy ke aavashyak tatv ke rup main ras kii pratishtha karte hue shringaar, hasya, raudra, karun, vir, adbhut, bibhats tathaa bhayanak naam se uske aath bhedon kaa spasht ullekh kiya he tathaa katipay panktiyon ke aadhaar par vidwaanon kii kalpana he ki unhone shant naamak nawein ras ko bhi sweekruti di he
 Navaras is the noun of these nine juices
 vibhavanubhav-sancharibhav ke sanyog se in rason kii nishpatti hoti he
 The permanence of each juice is different
 usee kii vibhavadi sanyog se paripurna honevaali nirvighn-pratiti-grahya avasthaa ras kehalaati he
 Sringar's permanent rite, humor humor, raudra's wrath, Karun's grief, valor's excitement, wonder of wonder, jugupsa of beauty, fear of terrible and permanent sham of calm or nirvade
 bharat ne aath rason ke devtaa kramash: vishnu, pramath, rudra, yamraj, indra, brahma, mahakaal tathaa kaldev ko mana he
 Narayana, the god of quiet juice, and his character Kundetu are said to be
 pratham aath rason ke kramash: shyaam, sit, rakt, kapot, gaur, pit, nil tathaa krishna varna maane gaye hai
 Bharata has considered the origin of humor, compassion, wonderful and terrible rasa in the first eight rasas, considering Shringar, Raudra, Veer and Vibhatsa as the principal
 shringaar kii anukriti se hasya, raudra tathaa vir karm ke parinamswaroop karun tathaa adbhut evam vibhats darshan se bhayanak utpann hota he
 Anukriti means Abhinavagupta's words, so the feel of any juice can be productive of humor
 vikrut veshalankaradi bhi hasyotpadak hote hai
 The work of Rādra is destruction, hence the doer of Karun and the performer of heroic work are often seen doing unpardonable actions, so it seems natural to originate from him
 isi prakaar bibhatsadarshan se bhayanak kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 Smashanadi's philosophy alone is frightening
 tathaapi yah utpatti siddhant atyantik nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki parapaksh kaa raudra yaa vir ras swapaksh ke liye bhayanak kii sristi bhi kar saktaa he or bibhatsadarshan se shant kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 The origin of Karun is also possible from Raudra, terrible, Shringar, wonderful and heroic and terrible
 vastut: bharat kaa abhimath spasht nahin he
 After him, Dhananjaya considered the four stages of the mind as growth, expansion, disturbance and deflection, adornment and humor as growth, heroic and wonderful as expansion, disturbing and terrible as distraction and raudra and Karun related to deflection
 kintu jo vidvan keval druti, vistaar tathaa vikaas naamak teen hi avasthaaen maanate hai unka is vargeekaran se samaadhaan na hoga
 Similarly, if we consider the fluid state of the mind in Shringar, its expansion in humor and the wonderful, its brilliance in Veer and Raudra, and its hesitation in the horrors and the terrible, then even Bharata's order is not right
 ek sthiti ke saath duusari sthiti kii upasthiti bhi asambhav nahin he
 Deepti and Karun have both druti and hesitation in detail with the wonderful and heroic
 phir bhi bharatkrut sambandh sthaapan se itnaa sanket avashya miltaa he ki kathith rason main paraspar upakaarkarta vidyaman he or ve ek duusare ke mitra tathaa sahachaari hai
 Like friendship, the opposition of these juices has also been imagined according to the situation
 kis rasvishesh ke saath kin anya rason kaa turant varnan aswaad main baadhak hoga, yah virombhavna isi vichaar par aadhaarit he
 Of Shringar from Karun, Bibhatsa, Raudra, Veer and Bhavya; Horrible and compassionate to comic; Karun with humor and adornment; Of humor, adornment and terrible of raudra; Shringar, Veer, Raudra, of humor and the terrible of calm; From the terrifying and serene to the heroic; Veer, adornment, raudra, humor and gruesome calm are considered opposites
 yah virodh aashray aikya, alamban aikya athwa nairantary ke kaaran upasthit hota he
 There is a possibility of this opposition in the management poetry itself
 muktak main prasang kii chand ke saath hi samaapti ho jane se iskaa bhay nahin rahata he
 The writer should avoid the presence of anti-rasam from the presence of the antagonistic juices and the alarms separately or by presenting the friendly juice of the two between the two opposing rasas or by presenting the amaranth of angras rather than the principal rasa
 
 ras kii aswadaniyata kaa vichaar karte hue use brahmanand sahodar, swaprakashanand, vilakshan aadi bataaya jaataa he or is aadhaar par sabhi rason ko anandatmak mana gaya he
 Bhattnayak has indicated the beauty of all the juices by showing mritva-paratva-inferior condition due to Sattvodrak, Abhinavagupta, Nirvigna's realization and Anandavardhan stating the state of melody and humidity in Karuna as Shringar, Vipralambha and Karuna progressively flourishing
 kintu anukoolvedaniyata tathaa pratikulvedaniyata ke aadhaar par bhaavon kaa vivechan karke rudrabhatt ramchandra gunachandra, haripal, tathaa dhananjay ne or hindi main acharya ramchandra shukla ne rason kaa sukhaatmak tathaa du:khaatmak anubhuthavaala mana he
 Abhinavagupta had first introduced the theory of "sukhu: Khasbhavono Ras:" in "abhinavabharati"
 sukhaatmak rason main shringaar, vir, hasya, adbhut tathaa shant kii or du:khaatmak main karun, raudra, bibhats tathaa bhayanak kii gananaa kii gai
 By giving the example of "pancaras", it has been proved that in the Panc juice made by mixing jaggery, Mirich etc
, there is a peculiar kind of taste, not knowing the sour sweetness of different items, it is also said that that picture In the same way, in a proportionate way, sometimes sour, sometimes hard, and so on, the taste of other types comes
 madhusudan saraswati kaa kathan he ki raj athwa tam kii apeksha satv ko pradhan maan lene par bhi yah to maananaa hi chahie ki anshat: unka bhi aswaad bana rahata he
 Acharya Shukla is of the opinion that the feeling we have is of the described sense and the expressions are of a dry, sadistic nature, etc
 Therefore, the rasa will also be of both types
 duusari ore rason ko anandatmak maanane ke pakshpaati sahrudayon ko hi iskaa praman maanate hai or tark kaa sahaara lete hai ki du:khadaayi vastu bhi yadi apni priy he to sukhadaayi hi prathit hoti he
 For example, at the time of the night, a woman feels pain in her body, but at that time she considers it a pleasure
 bhoj tathaa vishwanath kii is dharna ke atirikt swayan madhusudan saraswati rason ko loukik bhaavon kii anubhuti se bhinn or vilakshan maanakar inaki anandatmakataa kaa samarthan karte he or abhinavgupt vitvighnaprathit vatakar is dharna ko spasht karte hai ki usee bhav kaa anubhav bhi yadi bina vichlit hue or kisi bahari athwa antarodbhoot antaraay ke bina kiya jaataa he to vah sahya hone ke kaaran anandatmak hi kehalaata he
 If you consider it to be sorrowful, then consider the distinction of adornment as sad as well, then why should the distinction of adornment be considered sorrowful? By giving many such arguments, the conformity of the juices is proved
 angreji main tragedy se milanevaale anand kaa bhi anek prakaar se samaadhaan kiya gaya he or marathi lekhakon ne bhi rason kii aanandarupata ke sambandh main paryaapt bhinn dharanaayen prastut kii hai
 Often, the notion of considering Ras as the same in the traditional form has been prevalent, considering the different names of the juices as official or formal authority
 bharat ne "na hi rasaadrute kashchidpyarth : pravartat" pankti main "ras" shabd kaa ek vachan main prayog kiya he or abhinavgupt ne uparilikhit dharna vyakt kii he
 Bhoja has treated Shringar as the only juice and has always interpreted it differently, according to Vishwanath, Narayan Pandit considers the miraculous miracle to be the only juice, because miracle is the form
 bhawabhooti ne karun ko hi ekmaatr ras maanakar usee se sabaki utpatti bataai he or bharat ke "swan swan nimittamasadya shantadbhav: pravartate, punarnimittapaye c shant evopaliyate" - vaktavy ke aadhaar par shant ko hi ekmaatr ras mana ja saktaa he
 Similarly, on the basis of the server-friendly state of excitement and amazement, they can also be considered at the root of all other juices
 ras aswaad or anand ke rup main ek akhand anubhuti maatr hai, yah ek paksh he or ek hi ras se anya rason kaa udbhav hua he yah doosraa paksh he
 In the idea of rasapradhanya, the problem of rajrajata has arisen
 bharat samast shuchi, ujwal, medhya or dalneey ko shringaar maanate hai, "agnipurana" shringaar ko hi ekmaatr ras bataakar anya sabko usee ke bhed maanata he, bhoj shringaar ko hi mul or ekmaatr ras maanate hai, parantu uplabdh likhit pramaan ke aadhaar par "rasraj" shabd kaa prayog "ujjvalaneelamani" main bhakthiras ke liye hi dikhaai detaa he
 In Hindi, Keshavdas considers Shringar to be the origin of all Rasas and Rasavayak Dev
 "rasraj" sangya kaa shringaar ke liye prayog matiram dwaara hi kiya gaya miltaa he
 On the other hand, Banarasidas declares "navamo Sant Rasani Ko Nayak" in the play "samayasara"
 rasarajata kii sweekruti vyapaktaa, utkar aswadyata, anya rason ko antarbhoot karne kii kshamta sabhi sanchaariyon tathaa saatvikon ko ant:saat karne kii shakti sarvapranisulabhtv tathaa shighragrahyata aadi par nirbhar he
 All these things are found in as much and strong makeup, not in other juices
 at: rasraj vahi kehalaata he
 Raso's king Shringar Ras is considered vichaarco ne raudra tathaa karun ko chhodkar shesh rason kaa bhi varnan kiya he
 The most detailed description of these is that of dressing
 shringaar mukhyat: sanyog tathaa vipralambh yaa viyog ke naam se do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he, kintu dhananjay aadi kuch vidvan vipralambh ke purvanurag bhed ko sanyog-vipralambh-virahit purvavastha maanakar ayog kii sangya dete hai tathaa shesh viprayog tathaa sambhog naam se do bhed or karte hai
 On the basis of many circumstances of coincidence, it is considered to be invisible and it is distinguished only by the idea of asylum, heroic or amphibious, disguised with the idea of publication and light or clear and secret and secret and narrow, narrow, prosperous and prosperous with the idea of publication type and The antecedents or aspirations of Vipralambha, Maan or Ishratheetuk, Migration, Viraha and Karun Pralambha were distinguished
 Huh
 "kavyprakash" kaa virahahetuk nayaa he or shaapahetuk bhed pravaas ke hi antargat gruhit ho saktaa he, "sahityadarpan" main karun vipralambh kii kalpana kii gai he
 From the point of view of antecedent reason, on the basis of virtue and brightness, brightness, eye-sighting, imagery, dream and indraja-darshana-jagya and raga are divided into blue, kusumbha and manjistha
 "alankarikoustubh" main sheeghra nasht honevaale tathaa shobhit na honevaale raag ko "haridr" naam se chauthaa bataaya he, jise unka tikaakar "shyamaraag" bhi kahata he
 The predicaments of the predecessor - Abhilasha, Anxiety, Reminiscence, Gunakirtana, Udveg, Lament, Vyadhi, Inertia and Death - have been considered, in whose place Vishnu Dharmadartyapurana as the opinion of himself and elsewhere, the commentary of the tentacular, the epithet, the greatness
 And with a slight change in Saraswati Kantharan and poetry, Chakshupriti, mind, remembrance, sleeplessness, tanuta, vocation, shame, mania, Uchrchha and has been mentioned death
 shaardatnay ne ichha tathaa uthkanthaa ko jodakar tathaa vidyanath ne samaran ke sthaan par sankalp laakar or pralaap tathaa sanjvar ko badhaakar inaki sankhya 12 maani he
 It is not rational and can have an inbreeding effect
 maan-vipralambh pranay tathaa ishrya ke vichaar se do prakaar kaa tathaa maan kii sthirataa tathaa aparaadh kii gambhirtha ke vichaar se laghu, madhyam tathaa guru naam se teen prakaar kaa, pravasvipralambh kaaryaj, shaapaj, sanbhramaj naam se teen prakaar kaa or kaaryaj ke yasyatpravas yaa bhavishyat gachchhatpravas yaa vartmaan tathaa gatpravas yaa bhavishyat gachchhatpravas yaa vartmaan tathaa gatpravas yaa bhootpravas, shaapaj ke tadrupya tathaa vairupy, tathaa sambhramaj ke utpaat, vaat, divya, maanush tathaa parachakradi bhed ke kaaran kai prakaar kaa hota he
 Due to the closeness of Virah Gurujnadi, even after being close, the disconnection of the heroine and the hero coinciding and Karun Vipralambha is the hope of union by resurrection even after death
 shringaar ras ke antargat nayikalankar, ritu tathaa prakruti kaa bhi varnan kiya jaataa he
 An example is- isi prakaar sanyog tathaa vipralambh yaa viyog ke naam se do bhaagon main vibhajit shringaar ras kaa udhaaharan- Distinguishing the self, lust, dislocated, subjugated, hijacked and overbearing from the potentiality of humor and the development of humor and development of humor, making three distinctions from their superior, medium and unholy nature, the two aforesaid distinctions were placed respectively
 has gone
 hindi main keshavadas tathaa ekaadh anya lekhak ne keval mandahas, kalhas, atihaas tathaa parihaas naamak chaar hi bhed kiye hai
 Many other names of humor based on English have also become popular
 udhaaharan - New example- shant kaa koi bhed nahin he
 Only Rudrabhatta has definitely given four distinctions under the names Vairagya, Doshanigraha, Santhosh and Tattvakshakshpatakara which are mere names and their number can be increased
 udhaaharan - In the eight dramas propounded in Bharatamuni's 'natyashastra', the difference between adornment and humor and Karun Rasa was calculated before Rudra
 ‘raudratu karuno ras:’ kahkar 'karun ras' kii utpatti 'raudra ras' se maani gai he or uski utpatti shaapjanya klesh vinipat, ishtjan-viprayog, vibhav naash, vadh, bandhan, vidrav arthath palaayan, apaghaat, vyasan arthath aapatti aadi vibhaavon ke sanyog se sweekaar kii he
 Also nirved, guilt, worry, adulation, impulse, fascination, labor, fear, sadness, pity, sickness, inertia, hysteria, epiphany, tragedy, laziness, death, stanza, vapathu, vevarnya, teardrop, swearing etc
 Calculated as an expression
 udhaaharan - In poetic juices, there is an important place for raudra rasa
 bharat ne ‘naatyashaastra’ main shringaar, raudra, vir tathaa vibhats, in chaar rason ko hi pradhan mana he, at: inhen se anya rason kii utpatti bataayi he, yatha-‘teshamutpattihetavakshatvaaro rasa: shringaaro rodro vero vibhats iti’
 Describing the origin of Karun Rasa from Raudra, Bharata says that 'raudrasyaiv ch yatkam sa shey: Karuno rasa:'
 raudra ras kaa karm hi karun ras kaa janak hota he
 The 'permanent emotion' of the raudra rasa is 'anger' and its character is blood and the deity Rudra
 keshavadas kii ‘ramachandrika’ se raudra ras kaa udhaaharan pehle hi ankit kiya ja chukaa he
 Examples of raudra rasa are also found in Bhushan's compositions
 vartmaan kaal main shyaamanarayan pandeya tathaa ‘dinakar’ kii rachanaaon main raudra ras kii prabhavakaari vyanjana hui he
 In the Sanskrit texts, 'mahabharata' and 'veeracharit', 'venichabhika' etc
 plays have had a powerful expression of the raudra rasa
 udhaaharan - Along with Shringar, Raudra and Vibhats, Veeraras is also enumerated by Bharata Muni in the original rasas
 vir ras se hi adbhut ras kii utpatti batalaai gai he
 The 'varna' of Veer Ras is called 'swarna' or 'gaur' and the god Indra
 yah uttam prakruti waalo se sambaddh he tathaa iskaa sthaayee bhav ‘utsaah’ he
 Only Yudveer, Dharmaveer, Dayavir and Danveer distinction of Veer Ras are accepted
 utsaah ko aadhaar maanakar panditraj aadi ne anya anek bhed bhi kiye hai
 Examples - adbhut ras ke bharatmuni ne do bhed ie hai- divya tathaa anandaj 
 The Vaishnava Acharya makes a distinction called vision, श्रrut, Sankrit and Anumit
 bibhats bharat tathaa dhananjay ke anusaar shuddh, kshobhan tathaa udayegi naam se teen prakaar kaa hota he
 Three types are considered to be derogatory or illusory, criminological or imaginary, and three types of dissonant or real name, and two types of self-directed distinction from terrible causation
 sthayibhaavon ke kisi vishesh lakshan athwa rason ke kisi bhav kii samanta ke aadhaar par praaia: rason kaa ek duusare main antarbhaav karne, kisi sthayibhav kaa tiraskaar karke naveen sthaayee maanane kii pravriti bhi yada-kada dikhaai padi he
 As such, among Shanta Rasa and Dayavir and Vibhats, Dayavir's intrusion into calm and unhappy permanent Jugupsa is considered permanent
 "naganand" naatak ko koi shant kaa or koi dayavir ras kaa naatak maanata he
 But if the metaphysical pause of calm and compassionate zeal of Dayavir is noted, then there will be a difference between the two
 isi prakaar jugupsa main jo vikarshan he vah shant main nahin rahata
 Beyond both quiet rage and envy, there is a symmetry of inclusiveness and philosophy in which jugupsa can become communicable
 thik aise jaise karun main bhi sahanubhuti kaa sanchaar rahata he or dayavir main bhi, kintu karun main shok kii sthiti he or dayavir main sahanubhuthaprerit aatmashaktisambhoot aanandarup utsaah kii
 Or, just as both Raudra and Yudhveer have an enemy, so both have the amount of anger, but the rapture in Prahodratikul acuteness and indiscretion, and Yudhveer have a ferocity and prudence
 krodh main shatruvinaash main pratishodh kii bhaavana rahati he or vir main dhairya or udaartaa
 Therefore, their mutual interaction is not possible
 isi prakaar "anmarsh" ko vir kaa sthaayee maananaa bhi uchit nahin, kyonki amarsh ninda, apmaan yaa akshepadi ke kaaran chitt ke abhinivesh yaa swabhimanavbodh ke rup main prakat hota he, kintu viraras ke dayavir, daanveer, tathaa dharmaveer naamak bhedon main is prakaar kii bhaavana nahin rahati

 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The Upanishads are important Shruti scriptures of Hinduism
 ye vaidic vaanmay ke abhinn bhaag hai
 It gives a very philosophical and knowledgeable description of the nature and relationship of God, god-brahma and soul
 upanishdon main karmkand ko 'avar' kahkar gyaan ko isliye mahatv diya gaya ki gyaan sthool se sookshm kii ore le jaataa he
 Knowledge of Brahma, Jiva and Jagat is the basic education of Upanishads
 bhagavadgita tathaa brahmasutra upanishdon ke saath milakar veydant kii 'prasthaantrayee' kehalaate hai
 The Upanishads are the basic source of all Indian philosophies, be it Vedanta or Samkhya or Jainism or Buddhism
 upanishdon ko swayan bhi veydant kaha gaya he
 Many philosophers of the world consider the Upanishads to be the best enlightenment
 upanishad bhartiya sabhyataa kii vishwa ko amuly dharohar he
 The main Upanishads are 12 or 13
 harek kisi na kisi veda se judaa hua he
 These are written in Sanskrit
 17ve sadi main daara shikoh ne anek upanishdon kaa farsi main anuwaad karaayaa
 In the 19th century, the German philosophers Schopenhauer and Maxmüller, who showed interest in these texts and translated them, are well known and respected
 upanishad shabd kaa saadhaaran arth he - ‘sameep upaveshan’ yaa 'sameep baithna 
 This word is derived from the prefix 'up', 'ni' and, 'sad' metal
 sad dhaatu ke teen arth hai: vivaran-naash hona; gati-paanaa yaa jaananaa tathaa avsaadan-shithil hona
 In the Upanishads there is a very beautiful and esoteric dialogue between the sage and the disciple that leads the reader to the heart of the Veda
 upanishad bhartiya aadhyatmik chintan ke muladhar he, bhartiya aadhyatmik darshan strot hai
 They are theology
 jigyaasaaon ke rishiyon dwaara khoje hue uttar hai
 They are the essence of the discourses of contemplative sages
 ve kavi-hriday rishiyon kii kavyamay aadhyatmik rachanaayen hai, agyaat kii khoj ke prayaas hai, varnanaatit paramashkti ko shabdon main baandhane kii koshishen hai or us niraakaar, nirvikaar, aseem, apaar ko antardrushti se samajhane or paribhaashit karne kii adamya aakanksha ke lekhabaddh vivaran hai
 The Vedic era was an era of worldly pleasure and consumption
 maanav man kii nishcintata, pavitrataa, bhavukta, bholepan va nishpapata kaa yug tha
 To live life with total carelessness was the love and credit of the people of that period
 prakruti ke vibhinn manohari swaroopon ko dekhakar us samay ke logon ke bhavuk manon main jo udgaar swayansfoort aalokit tarangon ke rup main ubhare un manobhaavon ko unhone prashastiyon, stutiyon, divyagaanon va kavy rachanaaon ke rup main shabdabaddh kiya or ve vaidic richaayen yaa mantra ban gaye
 The minds of those people were filled with worldly joy, were satisfied with prosperity, were overwhelmed by natural divinities
 at: unke geeton main yah kaamana he ki yah anand sadaa bana rahe, badhata rahe or kabhi samaapt na ho
 He wished that we would enjoy this bliss for the entire hundred years and the generations after us should also be satisfied
 yahi nahin kaamana yah bhi kii gai ki is jivan ke samaapt hone par ham swarg main jaaen or is sukh va anand kii nirantarata vahaan bhi bani rahe
 Various rituals were also performed to achieve this purpose and these boons were also sought from them by organizing to please the gods
 jab prakruti karavat leti thi to prakritik vipadaaon kaa saamana hota tha
 Then the rituals to appease and please the imaginary control gods of those plagues, such as Marut, Agni, Rudra, etc
 were performed and they were prayed not to let such plagues come and protect the subjects upon their arrival
 kul milakar vaidic kaal ke logon kaa jivan prafullit, ahladamay, sukhaakankshi, ashaavadi or jijeevishaapurna tha
 There was no shadow of sadness, sin or miserable life in them
 narak va usamen milane vaali yaatnaaon kii kalpana tak nahin kii gai thi
 Karma was considered to be yajna and yajna itself and the concept of attainment of all its pleasures and redress of hazards
 yah jeevanstyli dirghakaal tak chali
 But how long would this go on? ek na ek din to manushya ke anant jigyaasu mastishk main or vartmaan se kabhi santusht na hone vaale man main yah jigyaasa, yah prashn uthanaa hi tha ki prakruti kii is vishaal rangabhumi ke peeche sutaradhar koun he, iskaa sristaa / nirmaataa koun he, iskaa udgam kahan he, ham koun hai, kahan se aae hai, yah sristi antat: kahan jaaegi
 What will happen to us? Shanai: -shanai: These questions sprouted
 or phir shuru hui in sabake uttar khojane kii lalak tathaa jigyaasu man-mastishk kii anant khoj yatra
 It is not that the Vedic sages never thought about soul, rebirth and karmaphalvad
 aisa bhi nahin tha ki is jivan ke bare main unka koi dhyaan na tha
 The sages had also occasionally considered this subject
 iske beej vedon main yatra-tatra milte hai, parantu yah keval vichaar maatr tha
 No worries or fears
 aatma sharir se bhinn tatv he or is jivan kii samaapti ke baad vah paralok ko jaati he is siddhant kaa abhas vaidic richaon main miltaa avashya he parantu sansar main aatma kaa avaagaman kyon hota he, isaki khoj main vaidic rishi pravrutt nahin hue
 Worldly life with all its limitations was the beloved of the Vedic sages
 prey ko chhodkar shrey kii ore badhane kii aturata upanishdon ke samay jaagi, tab moksh ke saamne grahastha jivan nissar ho gaya evam jab log jivan se anand lene ke bajaay usase peeth pherakar sanyas lene lage
 Yes, it also happened that Vedic sages used to calm down by asking 'who created this world?' And 'who is the god whom we worship'? There, the sages of the Upanishads decided some principles regarding the creator and also found out the 'truth' which is the right to worship and worship
 vaidic dharm kaa purana aakhyaan veda or naveen aakhyaan upanishad hai
 'yajna-dharma was performed in the Vedas and people were taught that to be happy, prosperous and successful and victorious in this life, it is necessary to perform sacrifices for the satisfaction and happiness of the gods
 'vishwa kii utpatti kaa sthaan yajna he
 Yajna is the best of all actions
 yajna ke karmfal se swarg kii prapti hoti he
 'these sutras were all around
 duusare, jab brahman granthon ne yajna ko bahut adhik mahatv de diya or purohitwaad tathaa purohiton kii manamaani atyadhik bad gai tab is vyavastha ke viruddh pratikriya hui or virodh kii bhaavana kaa sutarapaat hua
 People started thinking 'what is the real meaning of Yajna?' 'what secret is there within them?' 'what form of religion do they symbolize?' 'will they lead us to the ultimate goal of life?' Thus, too much emphasis on rituals and the tendency of rituals to be presented as the solution to all the problems of life, led the thinking people to rethink about them
 prakruti ke prayek rup main ek niyantrak devtaa kii kalpana karte-karte vaidic arya bahudevvaadi ho gaye the
 Among his deities are Indra, Varuna, Agni, Savita, Som, Ashwini Kumar, Marut, Pushan, Mitra, Pitar, Yama etc
 tab ek bauddhik vyagrata prarambh hui us ek paramashkti ke darshan karne yaa uske vaastavik swaroop ko samajhane kii ki jo sampurna sristi kaa rachayita or in devataaon ke upar kii satta he
 This anxiety paved the way for the Upanishads
 upanishad chintansheel evam kalpashil manishiyon kii darshanik kavy rachanaayen hai
 Where the prose has been written, they are also such words-power, phonetics, love and semantics in the poetry prose that they give an impression of the works of some divine power
 yah sachmuch atyukti nahin he ki unhen 'mantra' yaa 'richa' kaha gaya
 In fact, the Mantra or Richa is related to the Vedas but these nouns are also used here by some scholars to indicate the affinity of the Upanishads
 upanishad apane aasapaas ke drishy sansar ke peeche jhaankane ke praytn hai
 There are no tools available for it and no research and research facilities are possible
 apni manshchetana, maansik anubhuti yaa antardrushti ke aadhaar par hue aadhyatmik sphuran yaa divya prakaash ko hi varnan kaa aadhaar banaaya gaya he
 The Upanishads are diverse chapters of spiritualism written by various inspired sages
 inamen vishwa kii paramsatta ke swaroop, uske avasthaan, vibhinn prakritik shaktiyon ke saath uske sambandh, maanviya aatma main uski ek kiran kii jhalak yaa sookshm pratibimb kii upasthiti aadi ko vibhinn rupakon or pratikon ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 An attempt has been made to present the design through various images and symbols, arising out of deep thinking and self-thinking in relation to the origin of the creation and its creation
 ant main kaha yah gaya ki hamaari shreshth pariklpana ke aadhaar par jo kuch ham samaj sake, vah yah he
 Beyond this, perhaps only the divine knows this secret and 'maybe he does not even know
 ' In short, in the Vedas, efforts were made to understand the nature of the visible and manifest natural powers in this world, to worship them by worshiping them, appeasing them and securing worldly success and prosperity and protection from them
 un tak apni shraddha ko pahunchaane kaa madhyam yagyon ko banaaya gaya tha
 The Upanishads describe the many efforts that were made with the desire to interview the supreme power behind these natural powers or the supreme power of creation
 maanviya kalpana, chintan-kshamta, antardrushti kii kshamta jahaan tak us samay ke darshanikon, manishiyon yaa rishiyon ko pahunchaa sakin unhone pahunchne kaa bharsak praytn kiya
 This was his tenacity
 veda ke chaar bhaag hai - samhita, brahman, aaranyak or upanishad
 The Upanishads depict self and non-self elements which represent the fundamental mysteries of the Vedas
 praaia: upanishad veda ke ant main hi aate hai
 Therefore, they are also known as Vedanta
 vaidic dharm ke moulik siddhanton ko teen pramukh granth pramanit karte hai jo prasthaantrayee ke naam se vikhyath hai, ye hai - upanishad, brahmasutra or shrimadbhagavadgita
 The Upanishads signify Brahmanism
 kehete hai is vidya ke abhyaas se mumukshujan kii avidya nasht ho jaati he ; vah brahm kii prapti kara detii he ; jisase manushyon ke garbhavas aadi sansaarik du:kha sarvatha shithil ho jate hai 
 As a result, the Upanishads are considered to be 'tattva' exponent texts, through practice of which a person is interviewed by Brahma or the Supreme Soul

 arthshaastra tathaa vaanijya main kisi utpaada yaa seva ke ek upyogkarta kaa anya prayoktaaon ke liye us utpaada yaa seva ke mulya par jo prabhaav padataa he use network prabhaav kehete hai
 The simplest example of this is telephone
 jitne hi adhik log telephone kaa upyog karenge, harek telephone upayokta ke liye yah seva utani hi upyogi siddh hogi
 This creates a positive effect because when one buys a telephone, it is rarely in his mind to give any benefit to anyone, but he inadvertently benefits many

 pagerank, named after Larry Page, is a link analysis algorithm used by Google search engines to assign a numerical weight to each element of a hyperlink-bound set of documents, such as the World Wide Web
 , So that its relative importance can be "measured" within the set
 yah algoritham parsparik uddharanon or sandarbhon ke saath tatwon ke kisi bhi sangrah par lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 The numerical weight assigned to a given element e is called the pagerank of e and is called PR
 { \ displaystyle PR
} is denoted by
 "pegerank" naam google kaa trademark he or pegerank prakriya kaa patent karavaaya ja chukaa he
 US Patent 62,85,999 However, the patent has been granted to Stanford University and not to Google
 google ke paas stanford vishvavidhyalay se praapt vishisht license adhikaar he
 The university received 1
8 million shares of Google in exchange for the use of patents; These shares were sold in 2005 for $ 336 million
 google pegerank kaa varnan is prakaar karata he: In other words, a pagerank is obtained by a "poll" between all other pages on the World Wide Web about how important a page is
 kisi prishth kii ore aane vaali ek hiserlink ko samarthan kaa ek mat mana jaataa he
 The pagerank of a page is defined iteratively and is dependent on the pagerank metric and number of all pages that join it
 jis prishth ke saath ucch pegerank vaale anek prishthon ne link banaae hon, use swatah hi ek ucch rank miltaa he
 If there is no link for a web page, there is no support for it
 google internet ke prayek webpej ko 0-10 ke bich ek ankiy bhaaran pradaan karata he; yah pegerank google kii nazaron main kisi site ke mahatv ko suchit karata he
 a theoretical probability on a logarithmic scale such as the Richter scale is used to obtain the pagerank
 kisi visisth prishth kaa pegerank mote taur par antargami links kii maatra or saath hi ye link pradaan karanevaale prishthon ke pegerank par nirbhar hota he
 It is known that other factors, e
g
 The suitability of search terms on the page and the number of actual visits to the page by the Google Toolbar also affect pagerank
 herapheri, dhokhebaazi or spamdexing se bachaav ke liye, google is bare main koi vishisht vivaran pradaan nahin karata ki anya kaarak pegerank ko kis prakaar prabhavit karte hai
 Since Page and Brin's original research paper, several academic papers related to pagerank have been published
 vyavhaar main, pegerank kii avadharana herapheri ke prati asurakshit sabit hui he or galat tareeke se badhaai gai pegerank kii pahchaan or galat tareeke se badhaai gai pegerank ke saath judanevaale dastavejon ko upekshit karne ke tareekon ke prati gahan anusandhan samarpit he
 Other link-based algorithms for web pages include the HITS algorithm discovered by John Kleinberg, the IBM CLEVER project, and the trustrank algorithm
 pegerank kaa vikaas stanford vishvavidhyalay main laire pej dwaara or baad main sargei brin dwaara ek nae prakaar ke search ingine se sambandhit anusandhan pariyojna ke ek bhaag ke rup main kiya gaya
 The first research paper about the project, which had an initial prototype of pagerank and the Google search engine, was published in 1998: Shortly afterwards Page and Brin founded Google Inc
, the maker of the Google search engine
 google search parinaamon kii ranking ko nirdhaarit karanevaale anek karkon main se ek hone ke saath hi pegerank google ke sabhi web search upkarnon ke liye aadhaar bhi pradaan karata he
 Revision analysis on pagerank has previously been influenced by hypersearch, developed by Eugene Garfield at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1950s and by Massimo Marchiori at the University of Padua
 The year that pagerank was presented, the same year John Kleinberg published his important work on HITS
 2010 main, harvard ke ek arthshaastri or 1973 ke nobel puraskaar vijeta vaisili leontif ke 1941 ke ek shodh-patr ko pegerank kii doharaavpurn kaarividhi ke praarambhik bauddhik purvavarti ke rup main pahachaanaa gaya
 pagerank is a probability distribution that is used to show the probability of a person clicking randomly on a link to a specific page
 pegerank kii gananaa kisi bhi aakaar ke dastavejon ke sangrah ke liye kii ja sakati he
 In many research papers, it is believed that at the beginning of the calculation process, this distribution is divided equally among all the documents of the collection
 pegerank gananaaon ke liye sangrah ke anek chakron ko dohraane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jinhen "itareshan" kehete hai, taaki saidhantik rup se shuddh maan ko adhik nikatataa se pratibimbit karne hetu pegerank ke anumaanit maanon ko samyojit kiya ja sake
 a probability is expressed as a numeric value between 0 and 1
 ek 0
5 prayikta ko saamanytah kisi kaary ke hone kii "50% sambhaavna" ke rup main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Hence 0
5 pagerank means that there is a 50% probability that someone clicking on a random link will be sent to a document with 0
5 pagerank
 chaar web prishthon: A, B, c or D, ke ek chote se brahmad par vichaar karen
 The initial estimate of pagerank will be divided equally between these four documents
 So each document will start with an estimated pagerank of 0
25
 pegerank ke mul rup main praarambhik maan keval 1 hote the
 This means that the sum of all pages was equal to the total number of pages on the web
 pegerank ke baad vaale sanskaran 0 or 1 ke bich kaa prayikta vibhaajan maanate he
 a simple probability distribution will be used here - so the initial value is 0
25
 yadi prishth B, c or d keval a ke liye link pradaan karte hai, to unamem se prayek prishth a ko 0
25 pegerank pradaan karegaa
 Thus in this simple system all the pagerank will be collected on PR a as all the links will be informing A
 yah 0
75 he
 Again, suppose Page b has a link to Page c as well and Page d has a link to all three pages
 link-maton kaa maan kisi prishth par sthit sabhi bahirgami links ke bich vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 Thus, the value of vote given by Page b to Page a is 0
125 and the value of vote given to Page c is 0
125
 d ke pegerank ke keval ek-tihaai bhaag kii gananaa hi a ke pegerank ke liye kii jaati he 
 In other words, the pagerank provided by outgoing pages equals the document's own pagerank score and the normalized number of outgoing links as a quotient of L
 saamaanya sthiti main, kisi prishth u ke pegerank maan ko is prakaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he: That is, the pagerank value of page u depends on the pagerank value of each page v of the aggregate Bu and the quotient of L, the number of links originating from page v
 pegerank siddhant maanata he ki links par yadrichhik rup se clic karanevaala koi kaalpanik prayokta bhi antat clic karnaa band kar degaa
 At any stage, the probability of the person continuing the task is an indifference factor d
 vibhinn adhyayanon ne vibhinn udaseenta karkon kaa pareekshan kiya he, lekin saamanytah yah mana jaataa he ki udaseenta kaarak 0
85 ke aas-paas nirdhaarit kiya jayega
 The attrition factor is subtracted by 1) and then this value is added to the product by the attrition factor and the inbound pagerank score
 arthath, Hence, pagerank of any page is mainly derived from pagerank of other pages
 praapt kiye gayi maan ko udaseenta kaarak neeche kii ore samyojit karata he
 However, a different formula was given in the original paper, which caused some confusion: in donon ke bich antar yah he ki pehle sutara main pegerank maanon kaa yogafal ek hota he, jabaki duusare sutara main prayek pegerank kaa n se guna kiya jaataa he or yogafal n ban jaataa he
 a statement from Page and Brin's research paper that "all pagerank totals are one" and the claims of other Google employees supports the first version of the above formula
 prayek baar web ko crol karne par google pegerank ke score kii punarganana karata he or apane suchakank kaa punarnirmaan karata he
 As Google increases the number of documents in its archive, the pagerank initial estimate for all documents also decreases
 yah sutara random sarfar ke ek model kaa prayog karata he, jo kuch clic ke baad ub jaataa he or kisi yadrichhik prishth kii ore chalaa jaataa he
 The pagerank value of a page reflects the likelihood that a random surfer will arrive at that page by clicking on a link
 This can be understood as a Markov chain, in which the states are pages and the probability of all changes is the same and they are links between pages
 yadi kisi prishth par anya prishthon ke liye koi link na hon, to vah ek sinc ban jaataa he or is kaaran vah yadrichhik surfing prakriya ko samaapt kar detaa he
 However, the solution is very simple
 yadi yadrichhik surfar ek sinc prishth par aata he, to vah yadrichhik rup se koi anya URL chunata he or punah surfing jari rakhata he
 Pages that do not contain any outbound links, when calculating pagerank, are considered to be linked to all other pages in the collection
 atah unke pegerank score anya sabhi prishthon ke bich baraabar bant jate hai
 In other words, to do justice to pages that are not in sync, these random changes are added to all nodes in the web, usually with a remainder probability of d = 0
85, which is measured by the frequency that a The average surfer uses his browser's bookmark feature
 atah sameekaran is prakaar hota he: Where p 1, p 2 ,
 
 
, p n { \ displaystyle p_ {1}, p_ {2}, 


, p_ {N}} are the pages being considered, m { \ displaystyle M} is a set of pages, Those connecting to pi { \ displaystyle p_ {i}}, l { \ displaystyle L} is the number of outbound links on page pj { \ displaystyle p_ {j}} and n is the total number of pages
 pegerank maan sanshodhit nikatataa matrix ke prabhavi ijanvector kii pravishtiyaan hoti hai
 This makes pagerank a uniquely attractive metric: eigenvector is jahaan r sameekaran kaa hal he Where the proximity function l { \ displaystyle \ ell} is 0, if the page pi { \ displaystyle p_ {i}} does not connect to the page pj { \ displaystyle p_ {j}} and is normalized such that each i for arthath, prayek stambh ke tatwon kaa yogafal 1 tak hota he 
 yah ijanvector kendriyata maapan kaa ek sanskaran he, jiskaa prayog saamanytah network vishleshan main kiya jaataa he
 Due to the large eigengap in the above modified eigenvector metrics, the values of the pagerank eigenvector can be estimated quickly
 marcove siddhant ke falswaroop, yah darshaya ja saktaa he ki kisi prishth kaa pegerank anek clic ke baad us prishth par hone kii prayikta hota he
 This equals t - 1 { \ displaystyle t ^ {- 1}}, where t { \ displaystyle t} is the estimate of the number of clicks required to return from a page to the same page again
 isaki mukhya kami yah he ki yah puraane prishthon ke prati pakshpaat karata he kyonki nayaa prishth, chaahe vah bahut acha bhi ho, jab tak kisi puraani site kaa ek bhaag na ho, tab tak uske paas anek links nahin honge

 google kii anya khoj sevaaon main pegerank kaa prayog khoj ke parinaamon main pradarshit prishthon ke praasangik score ke maapan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Various strategies have been proposed to speed up the calculation of pagerank
 khoj ke parinaamon kii ranking main sudhaar karne or vigyaapan links kaa mudrikaran karne ke majboot prayaason ke antargat pegerank main parivartan karne ke liye vibhinn ranneetiyaan lagu kii gayi hai
 These strategies have highly influenced the credibility of the pagerank concept, which attempts to determine which documents are actually highly valued by the web community

 In December 2007, Google began actively penalizing sites selling text links via payment
 google dwaara link formon or pegerank main parivartan karne ke anya upkarnon kii pahchaan kis prakaar kii jaati he, yah google ke vyapaarik rahasyon main se ek he
 In short, pagerank can be calculated iteratively or algebraically
 vaikalpik taur par ghaat doharaav vidhi, yaa ghaat vidhi, kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 In the first case, at t = 0 { \ displaystyle t = 0}, an initial probability distribution is assumed, normally jaisaa ki upar varnit he, prayek samay charan par gananaa nimnlikhit parinaam pradaan karti he Or in matrix notation jahaan r i = p r { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {R} _{i}=pr} or 1 { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {1} } keval ek ko rakhanevaala n { \ displaystyle N} lambaai kaa stambh vector he
 The matrix m { \ displaystyle { \ mathcal {M}}} is defined as arthath, Where a { \ displaystyle A} denotes the proximity matrix of the graph and k { \ displaystyle K} is a diagonal metric with an outer degree in the diagonal

 If the matrix m { \ displaystyle { \ mathcal {M}}} is a transformation probability, that is, a column-stochastic, in which a column has only zero zeros and r { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {R}} is a probability distribution, the equation of Is equivalent is prakaar pegerank r { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {R} }, m ^ { \ displaystyle { \ widehat { \ mathcal {M xxrep 4 } kaa mukhya ijanvector he
 a quick and simple method to calculate this is to use the power method: sequence the operator m ^ { \ displaystyle { \ widehat { \ mathcal {M xxrep 4 } , starting with an arbitrary vector x { \ displaystyle x}
 Is applied in, that is, jab tak Note that in the equation, the metrics written in parentheses on the right can be interpreted as jahaan p { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {P} } ek praarambhik prayikta vitaran he
 In the present case antat, yadi m { \ displaystyle { \ mathcal {M}}} main keval shunya maan vaale stambh hon, to unke sthaan par praarambhiksambhaavna vector p { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {P} } rakhaa janaa chaiye
 In other words jahaan metrics d { \ displaystyle { \ mathcal {D}}} ko is prakaar paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 with the following keval m { \ displaystyle { \ mathcal {M}}} kaa prayog karanevaali uparokt donon gananaaen samaan pegerank pradaan karti hai, yadi unkeprenaam prasamanyikrut na hon
 The calculation time of these three methods can vary greatly depending on the structure used for the calculation, the precise implementation of these methods and the required accuracy of the results

 google tulbaar, jo ki ek hari pattica par mouse ghumaae jane par pegerank maan darshata he, ke vipareet google diarectry pegerank ko ek ankiy maan ke rup main nahin, balki keval ek hari pattica ke rup main darshata he
 Although the pagerank displayed in the toolbar is considered to be derived from the actual pagerank value for most sites, it is important to note that this value was easily changed
 pichhlaa ek dosha yah tha ki ek HTTP 302 pratikriya yaa ek "rifresh" meta tag ke dwaara, ucch pegerank vaale kisi pej kii ore bheja jane vaala nimna pegerank vaala koi bhi prishth gantavy prishth kaa pegerank praapt kar letaa tha
 Theoretically, a PR 0 page with no inbound links could be referred to Google's home page — which has a PR of 10 — and then the PR of the new page would have been upgraded to PR10
 This technique of spoofing, also known as 302 Google jacking, was known as a failure or error in the system
 webmaster kii icchaanusaar kisi bhi prishth ke pegerank ko badla ja saktaa he or keval google ke paas hi prishth ke vaastavik pegerank kaa abhigam hota he
 Spoofing is usually identified by running a Google search for urls with questionable pagerank because the results will display the URL of a completely different site
 search ingine optimizeshan ke uddeshy se kuch companiyaan webmastaron ko ucch pegerank vaale links bechney kaa prastaav detii hai
 Since links from high-pr pages are considered more valuable, they are more expensive

 However, Google has publicly warned webmasters that if they sell or are found to be doing so for the purpose of giving pagerank and respect, their links will be devalued
 The method of buying and selling links is a subject of much debate among the webmaster community
 google ne webmastaron ko pryojit links par nofollow HTML atribute maan kaa prayog karne kii salaah di he
 According to Matt Cutts, Google is concerned about webmasters who try to play with the system and this reduces the quality and reliability of Google's search results
 mul pegerank algaridam tathakthith yadrichhik surfar model ko pratibimbit karata he, jiskaa arth yah he ki kisi vishisht prishth kaa pegerank yadrichhik rup se links par clic karne par us prishth par pahunchane kii saidhantik prayikta se praapt kiya jaataa he
 However, real users do not use the web at random, but instead visit the links according to their interest and purpose

 The Google Toolbar sends information of each page viewed to Google and in doing so provides the basis for pagerank calculation based on the considered surfer model

 This results in loss of real links for web crawlers to comply, making the original pagerank algorithm based on the random surfer model unreliable

 pegerank ke samaan hi ek anya gatij bhaaran vidhi kaa prayog vikipedia kii link sanrachana par aadhaarit pathan soochiyon ko ruchi ke anusaar nirmit karne ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he
 a web crawler can use pagerank as one of several important metrics for determining which URL to visit during a crawl of the web
 un praarambhik kaary patron main se ek,jinka prayog google ke nirmaan ke dauraan kiya gaya tha, Efficient crawling through URL ordering he, jo is baat ke nirdhaaran ke liye vibhinn mahatvapurn metrics ke prayog par charchaa karata he ki google kitni gaharaai tak or kisi site ke kitne bhaag tak crol karegaa
 pagerank is presented as one of these many important metrics, although some others are also listed, such as the number of inbound and outgoing links for a URL and the distance from the URL to the root directory on a site
 pegerank kaa prayog sampurna web par blogusphere jaise kisi samudaay ke prakat prabhaav kaa maapan karne kii ek kaary-paddati ke rup main bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, this approach uses pagerank to measure the distribution of attention in the reflection of a measurement-free network model
 kisi bhi paristhitiki tantra main, pegerank ke ek sanshodhit sanskaran kaa prayog un prajatiyon ke nirdhaaran ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, jo vaataavaran ke swasthya ko banaae rakhane ke liye aavashyak hon
 "nofollow" option == In early 2005, for the relativity of HTML links and anchor elements, Google implemented a new value "nofollow" to allow website developers and bloggers to create links to which Google pagerank purposes Will not consider - these are links that no longer "vote" in the pagerank system
 The nofollow relationship was added as an attempt to help combat spamdexing
 ek udhaaharan ke rup main, apane pegerank ko badhaane ke liye log pehle aise anek massej-board pravishtiyaan banaaya karte the, jinamein unki websiton ke link hote the
 With nofollow value, administrators can modify their code to automatically enter "rel = 'nofollow'" in all hyperlinks in message-board entries and thus prevent pagerank from being affected by those specific entries
 is
 haalanki, parihaar kii is vidhi kii vibhinn kamiyaan bhi hai, jaise vaastavik tippaniyon ke link maan ko ghataana
 In an effort to manually control the flow of pagerank within the pages of a website, many webmasters use a method called pagerank Sculpting - the act of strategically placing nofollow attributes on specific internal links to a website, So that pagerank can be diverted to the pages that the webmaster considers most important
 is chaal kaa prayog nofollow atribute ke janm ke samay se kiya ja rahaa he, lekin anek vyakti maanate hai ki yah takanic apni prabhavakaarita kho chuki he
 On October 14, 2009, Google employee Suzanne Mosqua confirmed that the company had removed pagerank from its Webmaster Tools section
 unki pravishti ne aanshik rup se kaha ki "ham lambey samay se logon ko bataa rahe hai ki unhen pegerank par itnaa adhik dhyaan kendrit nahin karnaa chaiye; aisa prathit hota he ki anek site maalik sochate hai ki yah unke liye sabase mahatvapurn maapan he, jo ki satya nahin he
 "pagerank continued to be displayed on Google Toolbar's web tools for two days after Mosqua's confirmation, and as of March 2010, it is still showing
