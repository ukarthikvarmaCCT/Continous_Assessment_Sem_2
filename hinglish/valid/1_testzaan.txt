 He accepted the clothes worn by India's poorest man, and Gandhi also advocated wearing home-made clothes
 Gandhi and his followers adopted the practice of weaving their own clothes through cotton and others like it
 Encouraged to work
 Although Indian workers were often lazy due to unemployment, they often bought their clothes from industrial manufacturers intended to serve British interests
 Gandhi's opinion was that if Indians started making their own clothes, it would be an economic shock to the British settled in India
 Consequently, the charkha was later included in the Indian national flag

 Gandhi never received the Nobel Prize for Peace, although he was nominated five times between 1937 and 1948, including a nomination by the American Friends Service Committee
 After decades, the Nobel Committee publicly declared that they regret their mistake and accepted that the reasons for not awarding were divided national views
 mahatma gandhi ko yah puruskaar 1948 main diya janaa tha, parantu unki hatya ke kaaran ise roak dena padaa
us saal do nae raashtra bharat or pakistan main yuddh chhid janaa bhi ek jatil kaaran tha
 The award was not given in Gandhi's death year 1948 because there was no surviving qualified candidate and when the Dalai Lama was awarded in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that "it is part of the tribute in memory of Mahatma Gandhi" 
 " The Government of India acquired Birla Bhawan, New Delhi, where Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948, and opened it to the public in 1973 as Gandhi Smriti

 Gandhi as a rule was against the concept of partition as it was contrary to his view of religious unity
 6 oktober 1946 main harijan main unhone bharat kaa vibhaajan pakistan banane ke liye, ke bare main likhaa: As presented by the Muslim League, it is un-islamic and i do not call it sinful
 That India be transformed into two warring groups is the enemy of both India and Islam
 ve mujhe tukdon main kaat sakate hai par mujhe us chiz ke liye raji nahin kar sakate jise main galat samajhataa hoon hamen aas nahi chhodni chahie, iske baavjood ki khyaali bate ho rahi hai ki hamen musalamaanon ko apane prem ke kaid main ablambit kar lenaa chahie
 Nevertheless, Jack Homer, noting Gandhi's long correspondence with Jinnah about the subject of Pakistan, says- "although Gandhi was personally against partition, he suggested a consensus under which the Congress and the Muslim League would form the provisional government
" Get your freedom by compromising below, after which the question of partition will be decided by the opinion of the districts where the number of Muslims Is good "
 Keeping this dual position on the subject of partition of India, Gandhi opened up the dimensions of criticism from both Hindus and Muslims
 mohammad ali jinna tathaa samakaleen pakistaniyon ne gandhi ko muslmaan rajnatik haq ko kam kar aankane ke liye ninda kii
 Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and his associates condemned Gandhi and alleged that he is politically engaged in persuading Muslims and that he is negligent about the atrocities on Hindus and has approved the creation of Pakistan
 It is still politically controversial today, as pakistani-american historian Ayesha Jalal argues that Gandhi and the Congress were not willing to share power with the Muslim League because of the partition, for example Hindu nationalist politician Pravin Togadia also Criticizing the leadership about the subject, it also indicates that the extreme weakness of their part led to the partition of India
 gandhi ne 1930 ke ant-ant main vibhaajan ko lekar israel ke nirmaan ke liye philistin ke vibhaajan ke prati bhi apni aruchi jaahir kii thi
 On 26 October 1938, he said in Harijan: mujhe kai patr praapt hue jiname mujhase poocha gaya ki main ghoshit karun ki germany main yahudiyon ke utpedan or arab-yahudiyon ke bare main kya vichaar rakhata hoon 
 aisa nahi ki is kathin prashn par apane vichaar main bina jhijak ke de paaungaa

 yahudiyon ko arabon par adhiropit karnaa anuchit or amanviya he jo kuch bhi aaj philistin main ho rahaa hai use kisi bhi aachaar samhita se sahi sabit nahi kiya ja saktaa
 Those who wanted to gain independence through violence also came under the grip of a little political fire because of their criticism of Gandhi, his refusal against the hanging of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Udam Singh, Rajguru caused his condemnation in some parties
 is aalochana ke liye gandhi ne kaha,"ek aisa samay tha jab log mujhe suna karte the kii kis tarah angrejo se bina hathiyaar ladaa ja saktaa he kyonki tab hathyaar nahi the
 

 But today i am told that my non-violence is of no use because it cannot stop the riots of hindu-muslims, so one should be armed for self-defense

 And for this, i will wait for the Jewish brothers to come and join me in my legal impunity, rather i am confident that in the end all will be compelled to accept my example
 If the recipe given here is accepted by a single Jew or all Jews, then their situation will not be worse than what it is today
 And if they willingly bear the given pain, it will give them inner strength and pleasure and Hitler's deliberate violence is also extracted as a simple genocide of the Jews and this will be the first answer against the declaration of his atrocities
 ishvar kaa bhay rakhane vaale, mrityu ke aatank se nahi darate
 Gandhi's statements received a lot of criticism for which he answered in the "question on Jews" article, along with his friends criticizing my appeal to the Jews
 Told the remedy of injustice against him, he is not new
 


meraa keval yah nivedan hai ki agar hriday se hinsa ko tyaag de to nishkarshtah vah abhyaas se ek shakti srujit karegaa jo ki bade tyaag ki vajah se he
 He responded to the criticisms in "answers to Jewish Friends" and "jews and Palestine", stating that "I asked for a renunciation of violence from the heart that would in practice create a power that is due to great sacrifice
" yahudiyon kii asann aahuti ko lekar gandhi ke bayaan ne kai tikaakaron kii aalochana ko aakarshith kiya
 Martin Buber, himself an opponent of the Jewish state, wrote a sharply critical letter to Gandhi on 24 February 1939
 Buber asserted that the treatment of Indian people by the British was different from the treatment of Jews by the Nazis, in addition, while the Indians were victims of persecution, Gandhi on some occasions supported the use of force
 
 gandhi ne 1930 main germany main yahudiyon ke utpedan ko satyagrah ke bheetar hi sandarbhit kaha
 In November 1938, he suggested a measure of non-violence for Nazi persecution of uprooted Jews: abhas hota he ki yahudiyon ke german utpedan kaa itihaas main koi saamanantar nahi
 puraane jamaane ke taanashaah kabhi itane pagal nahi hue jitna ki hitler hua or ise ve dharmik utsaah ke saath karte hai ki vah ek aise anany dharm or jangi raashtra ko prastut kar rahaa he jiske naam par koi bhi amanviyata maanviyata kaa niyam ban jaati he jise abhi or bhavishya main puruskrit kiya jaayegaa
 jaahir si baat he ki ek pagal parantu nidar yuva dwaara kiya gaya aparaadh sari jati par avishwasaneey ugrata ke saath padegaa
yadi kabhi koi nyaaysangat yuddh maanavtaa ke naam par, to ek puri com ke prati germany ke dheeth utpedan ke khilaaf yuddh ko purna rup se uchit kaha ja saktaa hai
 But i do not believe in any war
 It is not in my jurisdiction to discuss the pros and cons of war
 parantu germany dwaara yahudiyon par kiye gaye is tarah ke aparaadh ke khilaaf yuddh nahi kiya ja saktaa to germany ke saath gathbandhan bhi nahi kiya ja saktaa yah kaise ho saktaa hai ki aise deshon ke bich gathbandhan ho jisame se ek nyaay or prajatantr kaa daawa karata hai or doosraa jise donon kaa dushman ghoshit kar diya gaya he?" Gandhi's early writings on South Africa are quite controversial
 On March 7, 1908, Gandhi wrote in the Indian Opinion about his prison life in South Africa "kafirs are rude in governance - even more as prisoners
 They are annoying
" , Dirty and live almost like animals

 yah paaramparik rup se skool geet ke saath shuru hota he -- At the age of seventeen, Mehrunnisa was married to a courageous Iranian young man named 'alikuli', who was given the title of Sher Afghan and the manor of Burdwan at the beginning of the reign of Jahangir
 1607 i
 main jahangir ke duuton ne sher afakhaan ko ek yuddh main maar daalaa
 Mehrunnisa was captured and brought to Delhi and sent to the emperor's royal harem
 yahan vah badshaah akbar kii vidhwaa rani 'salima begum' kii paricharika bani
 Mehrunnisa first saw Jahangir on the occasion of Nowruz festival and, enchanted by her beauty, Jahangir married her in May, 1611 AD
 vivaah ke pashchaat jahangir ne use ‘nurmahal’ evam ‘noorjehan’ kii oopaadhi pradaan kii
 In 1613 AD, Nur Jahan was made 'pattamahishi' or 'badshah Begum'
 asaadhaaran sundari hone ke atirikt noorjehan budhimati, sheel or viveksmpann bhi thi
 He had a special interest in literature, poetry and fine arts
 uskaa lakshya bhed achook hota tha
 In 1619, he killed a lion with a single bullet
 in samast gunon ke kaaran usne apane pati par purna prabhutv sthapit kar liya tha
 As a result, the entire weight of Jahangir's rule had fallen on him
 sikkon par bhi uskaa naam khoda jane laga or vah mahal main hi darbar karne lagi
 His father Etmaduddola and brother Asaf Khan were accorded a high position in the Mughal court and his niece, who later became known as Mumtaz, married Shah Jahan
 usne pehle pati se utpann apni putree kaa vivaah jahangir ke sabase chote putr shehryaar se kar diya or kyonki uski jahangir se koi santan nahin thi, at: vah shehryaar ko hi jahangir ke uparaant raaj singhaasana par baithaana chaahati thi
 All these works of Nur Jahan were a part of his diplomacy
 1620 i
 ke ant tak noorjehan ke sambandh khurram se achche nahin rahe, kyonki noorjehan ko ab tak yah ahsaas ho gaya tha ki shahjahan ke baadashah banane par uskaa prabhaav shashan ke kaaryon par kam ho jaayga
 Therefore Nur Jahan started giving importance to Jahangir's second son 'shaharyar'
 chunki shehryaar alpaayu evam durbal charitra kaa tha, isliye uske samraat banane par noorjehan kaa prabhaav pehle kii tarah shashan ke kaaryon main bana rahata
 For this reason, Sher married his daughter 'ladli Begum', born of Afghan, to Shaharyar in 1620 AD and granted him mansab of 8000 / 4000
 shahjahan ko jab is baat kaa ahsaas hua ki noorjehan uske prabhaav ko kam karnaa chaah rahi he, to usne jahangir dwaara qandahar durg par akraman kar use jeetne ke aadesh kii avhelnaa karte hue 1623 i
 main khusro khaan kaa vadh kar dakkan main vidroh kar diya
 To suppress his rebellion, Nur Jahan did not send Asaf Khan and sent Mahavat Khan under the leadership of Shahzada Parvez
 un donon ne safaltaapurvak shahjahan ke vidroh ko kuchal diya
 Shah Jahan surrendered to Father Jahangir and was pardoned
 jamaanat ke rup main shahjahan ke do putron daara shikoh or aurangzeb ko bandhak ke rup main rajdurbar main rakhaa gaya
 By 1625 AD, Shah Jahan's rebellion completely subsided
 shahjahan ke vidroh ko dabaane main mahatvapurn bhoomika kaa nirvaah karne vaale mahavat khaan se noorjehan ko irshyaa hone lagi
 Nur Jahan realized that Mahavat Khan was one of those who did not accept my dominance in the work of governance
 mahavat khaan evam shahzada parvej kii nikatataa se bhi noorjehan ko khatara tha
 So to minimize his influence, Nur Jahan asked him to go to Bengal and give the account of the money looted during the war
 in kaarnon ke atirikt kuch or kaaran bhi the, jisase apamaanit mahasoos kar mahavat khaan ne vidroh kar kabul ja rahe samraat jahangir ko jhelum nadi ke tat par 1626 i

 Nur Jahan and his brother Asaf Khan were also arrested
 qaid main rakhane par bhi mahavat khaan ne jahangir ke prati nishtha evam sammaan kii baat nahin sochi
 In Rohtas, Nur Jahan and Jahangir liberated themselves from the influence of Mahavat Khan through diplomacy
 mahavat khaan apni suraksha ke liye ‘thatta’ kii ore bhaag gaya
 After Parvez's death on October 28, 1626, Mahavat Khan was weakened in some way and he went to the service of Shah Jahan

 singhaasana battisi bhi 32 kathaon kaa sangrah he jisamen 32 putaliyaan vikramaditya ke vibhinn gunon kaa katha ke rup main varnan karti hai
 Throne Battisi is originally a Hindi version of the Sanskrit work Throneadvatrinsati, which is also known as Dwatrinshatputalika
 sanskrit main bhi iske mukhyatah do sanskaran hai
 uttari sanskaran "singhasanadvatrinshati" ke naam se tathaa dakshini sanskaran "vikramcharita" ke naam se uplabdh he
 The earlier versions are called Kshemendra Muni

 But certainly nothing can be said about his creation

 Since each legend mentions Raja Bhoja, its creation period will be after the 11th century
 in kathaon kii bhoomika bhi katha hi he jo raja bhoj kii katha kahati he
 32 stories are told from the face of 32 effigies which are enshrined in a throne
 yah singhaasana raja bhoj ko vicitra paristhiti main praapt hota he
 One day, Raja Bhoja realizes that a simple shepherd is known for his justice, while he is absolutely illiterate and pastorally feeds the cows, buffaloes and goats of the potters of his own kingdom
 jab raja bhoj ne tahaqiqaat karai to pataa chalaa ki vah charvaaha saare faisale ek tile par chadhakar karata he
 King Bhoja's curiosity grew and he disguised himself and saw the shepherd decide on a complicated matter
 uske faisle or aatmavishvaas se bhoj itnaa adhik prabhavit hue ki unhone usase uski is adwitiya kshamta ke bare main jaananaa chaha
 When the shepherd, whose name was Chandrabhan, told that this power comes to him automatically after sitting on the mound, Bhoja decided to deliberately carve the mound
 jab khudaai sampann hui to ek rajsinghaasana mitti main dabaa dikhaa
 This throne represented an unprecedented form of workmanship
 isamen battis putaliyaan lagi thim tathaa keemtee ratna jade hue the
 When the dust and mud were cleaned, the beauty of the throne was seen
 use uthaakar mahal laayaa gaya tathaa shubh muhoort main raja kaa baithna nishchit kiya gaya
 As the king tried to sit, all the effigies started ridiculing the king
 khilakhilaane kaa kaaran poochne par sari putaliyaan ek-ek kar vikramaditya kii kahani sunaane lageen tathaa boli ki is singhaasana jo ki raja vikramaditya kaa he, par baithne vaala uski tarah yogya, parakramee, daanveer tathaa vivekshil hona chahie
 These stories are so popular that many collectors have presented them in their own way
 sabhi sankalnon main putliyon ke naam die gaye hai par har sankalan main kathaon main kathaon ke kram main tathaa naamon main or unke kram main bhinnata pai jaati The order of names in a collection is as follows - ratnamanjari • chitralekha • chandrakala • kaamkandala • leelavati • ravibhama • kaumudi • pushpavati • madhumalati • prabhavati • trilochana • padmavati • kirtimati • sunayana • sundaravati • satyavati • vidyavati • taravati • ruparekha • gyaanavati • chandrajyoti • anurodhwati • dharmavati • karunavati • trinetri • mriganayani • malayavati • vaidehi • maanavati • jayalakshmi • kaushalya • rani rupavati • dekhen: singhaasana battisi • raja bhoj • Marwa is a village in Bihpur, Bhagalpur, Bihar

 He was a great war hero of Troy and a major hero of Homer's Iliad
 wo un yoddhaon main sabase sundar tha jinhone troy ke viruddh yuddh kiya tha
 He was the son of Nymphet Thetis and Pelius, king of the Marmidons
 zyoos or posydan donon thetis se vivaah karnaa chaahate the jab tak ki promeths ne zyoos ko ye bhavishyavaanee nahin bataai ki thetis kaa putr apane pita se mahaan hoga
 Zeus and Poseidon then let Thetis marry Pelius
 ekiliad ke anusaar jab akilis kaa janm hua tab thetis ne use sticks nadi main dubokar amar banane kaa prayaas kiya
 But the part of his body from where Thetis held him, his heel, could not become immortal
 isi prakaar ek anya katha me yah vivaran uplabdh he ki usne apane putr ke sharir par ambrosia, jo ki amrit hota he, kaa lep kiya or putr ko aag ke upar rakh diya taaki uskaa sharir amar ho jaye, par pelius ne use bich me hi roak diya, jisase usne gusse main aakar use chhod diya
 The result was that his heel could not become immortal
 homer ke eliad main yah vivaran uplabdh he ki ek baar akilis ko pelegus ke bete va pionian ke hero esteropes ne yuddh ke liye lalakaara
 He threw two spears at Akilis together, one on his heel and started bleeding from there
 isse pataa chalata he ki uski edi ko chhodkar uske sharir ke anya sabhi bhaag amar the

 The king of that place was Talephus
 yuddh main parinamat: akilis ne telefus ko ek ghaav diya jo kabhi thik nahin hota; tab telefus ne ek orecle se salaah lee, jisane kaha ki "usne jo ghaav diya he wo thik ho jaayegaa"
 According to the Oracle, he came to Argos, where Akilis healed his wounds on the condition that he would show them the way to Troy
 is yuddh main akilis ne troy ke mahaan yoddha evam yuvaraj hectares kaa vadh kiya evam troy ke hajaaron sipaahiyon ko maaraa
 Hector was known not only for Troy but for his valor in the whole world
 par vah akilis ke saamne tik na sakaa
 Even after Hector's death it was impossible for the Greeks to enter Troy, so they made a wooden horse, inside which they entered Troy
 vah kaath kaa ghoda itihaas main kaath ashv ke naam se prasiddh hua
 After Troy was defeated in the war, Paris deceitfully extinguished the poison and killed him in the eddy of Akilis
