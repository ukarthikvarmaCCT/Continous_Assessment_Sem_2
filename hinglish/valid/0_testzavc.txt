 To fulfill their selfishness, they run a variety of tricks
 punah kisi vaad ke niraakaran ke liye kisi tathy yaa pramaan kaa grahan samuchit ho saktaa he, kintu anya vishay main vah prativufal tathaa anupyukt bhi ho saktaa he
 This saying is famous that 'there are two aspects to the coin', if one side is bright or beneficial then the other side can be blunt and harmful
 isliye kisi vaad ke niraakaran ke liye prayukt tathy kaa sabhi paristhitiyon main sarvada grahan samuchit nahin
 Then due to country, state and circumstances, facts and truth also change
 drushtavy he ki ‘satya or vaastaviktaa main bhi anek baar bhed ho jaataa he
 'because of repeated or popular practice, we accept something as true, but in reality it is not the same
 atah vaastaviktaa ko drushtigat rakhkar hi koi nirnay lenaa samuchit he
 One should not accept any fact due to size or gravity
 anek baar dekha jaataa he ki keval bada hona hi paryaapt nahin, usamen gun bhi hone chahie
 Therefore, it is foolish to accept anything because of mere size gravity
 is prakaar kalaamon ko die gaye is upadesh main shiksha di gai he ki parampara se prachlit athwa pracheen kaal se nirantar kathith athwa dharmagranth main likhit athwa vaad ke niraakaran ke liye prayukt tathy athwa aakaar yaa gurutv ke kaaran hi kisi tathy yaa vishay ko nahin sweekaar kar lenaa chahie
 Thus Lord Buddha declared these subjects as invalid according to the circumstances - tab koun si kasautiyaan hai ki jinhen sweekaar kiya ja saktaa he? yadi ye dharm hai, anindaneey hai tathaa isko grahan karne par iskaa fal sukhad or hitprad hi hoga
 Surely, what can be a better criterion for human thinking, scientific and rationalism than this principle? tab bhagwaan buddha ne kalaamon ko maanya baton ke vishay main bataaya
 He presented all the subjects in a very wise and systematic manner to the Kalamas, which can be said to be valid and true
 bhagavan buddha kehete hai ki kisi bhi vishay ko tabhi maanya kiya ja saktaa he, jab vah vishay dhrm-sammat he arthath dharm ke anukool tathaa kushal hai
 Surely, if a work or a topic in the society leads to the welfare of all and the people suffering from grief are relieved or the path of development and development in the lives of people opens up and everyone has an interest, then this topic should be said will
 atah sabhi kalyankari tathaa maanviya shubh karm vufashal dhrm kahe jate hai
 One should give recognition to these successful deeds and serve humanity by performing these successful deeds
 ve sabhi vishay jo anindaneey tathaa aghrunit he, ve samaaj main maanya qaraar diye jane chahie
 If there is no defect in any subject and that subject is worship, then in such a situation it must be recognized
 un sabhi vishyon or manyataon ko maanya qaraar dena chahie jinke grahan se sukhakaari or hitprad parinaam praapt honge
 If the result of doing any work is pleasing and the interest of all humanity is satisfied, then doing such deeds is definitely beneficial for the society
 aise kalyankari vishyon kaa karnaa laabhakaari hota he
 In this way Lord Buddha declared the above mentioned criteria as valid or true before the Kalams
 ve is prakaar hai - Thus, these scientific words of Lord Buddha are equally relevant and receptive in modern times

 aise samay main jabaki bharat se buddha dharm tathaa pali sahitya kaa lop ho chukaa tha, inhone hi granthon kaa sampaadan tathaa anuwaad karke prakaashan karaayaa tathaa prachaar kiya
 Careful reading of his life-stories, it is known that all three of them will be highly influenced by the kutmuti-sutta existing in the Dharmadhurandhar Angusvakya body
 kalaamon ko sambodhit karte hue unhen diya gaya yah kesamutti-sutt samast vaanmay prapanch main vivekwaad tathaa swatantra chintan ke liye ek prakaar kaa ghoshnaa-patr hi he
 This Sutta given to Kalams is indeed a realm for humanity
 is kesamutti sutt ne in vidwaan bhikshuon ko atyant prabhavit kiya
 In his autobiography, Rahul Sanvruthyayan reveals the attraction of Lord Buddha and Buddhist philosophy in this way - dhai hajaar varsh pehle ke samaaj or samay main buddha ke yuktipurna saral or chubhane vaale vaakyon kaa main tanmayata ke saath aswaad lene laga
 The socks and miracles that came to Tripitaka were not entertainment, but the content of my disgust for its improbability
 main samajhataa tha, pachchis sau varshon kaa prabhaav un granthon par na ho yah ho nahin saktaa
 How much Buddha has actually said in impossible things, it cannot be decided today, then the miraculous sentences of Buddha coming in between like coals hidden in ashes or stones covered with stones used to pull my mind towards myself
 jab maine kalaamon ko diye buddha ke upadesh- ‘kisi granth, parampara, bujurg kaa khyaal kar use mat maano, hameshaa khud nishchay karwef us par arudh ho’ ko suna, to hathaat dil ne kaha- yahan he ek aadmi jiskaa satya par atal vishwaas he, jo manushya kii swatantra buddhi ke mahatva ko samajhataa he
 When i read in the majjhim-nikya - 'like a fleet, i have preached to you religion, it is for crossing over, not carrying on your head and not carrying it, then you know, the thing that i have been searching for for so many days
 She was found
 rahulji bhagwaan buddha dwaara updisht maanav kalyaan sambaddh baton se tathaa tarksangat vishyon ke pratipaadan ke kaaran unase atyant prabhavit rahen
 In fact, none of the teachings by Lord Buddha is beyond human welfare and logic
 vefasamutti sutt main buddha bhagwaan dwaara kalaamon ko di gai shikshaprad-panktiyaan rahulji ke hriday main utar si gai thi
 Bhadant Anand Kaushaliyan also accepts his point of view towards this Sutta by accepting a similar thing in the preamble of the Angusadh body
 ve likhte hai ki kesamutti-sutt ko padhakar hi ve buddha-dhamm tathaa sahitya kii ore aakarshith hue
 In the Preface to Anganwaja Nikaya, he writes as follows - vaishvik itihaas main bhagwaan buddha ne yah nai baat kahin he
 No religious leader dared so much
 sabhi apni apni bhagavatta ko sthapit karne yaa use bachaane ke prayaas main hi lage dikh padate hai
 But the talk of Lord Buddha is unique
 ve swayan ke dwaara kahi gai baat ko bhi aankh band karke na maanane kii shiksha ko is prakaar upasthaapit karte hai- Meaning - 'O Pandit! Just as a suvarna is cooked by high temperature, similarly my words should be tested and received, not due to my pride
 ’ Through the above verses, Lord Buddha keeps the faith of science out of reverence for himself and inspires him to take up the subject by keeping the test of science

 An Ethernet card is required in the computer to connect LAN / Ethernet with the computer
 ek local aria network main kuch aavashyak chijen hoti hai, jaise, do yaa do se adhik computer, jo network se jude hon, har computer main ek network interphes card, computer ko jodne ke liye ek ethernet cabile, network yatayaat ko nirdeshit karne ke liye ek netwarking hub or samarthak software
 a special address is assigned to it by placing the network interface card on each computer
 har interphes card ek ethernet cabile ke madhyam se kendriya hub se judaa hota he

 This network is relatively more robust but requires additional security, because wires can be connected to certain computers, but when all data is available in a wireless environment, any computer can get it

 The same thing is about unconsciousness
 moorchha yaa behoshee samajhane ke liye pehle saamaanya avasthaa hosh yaa chetanta ko jaan lenaa uchit hoga
 Consciousness is a situation in which a person has full knowledge or knowledge of himself and the environment and reacts according to his needs
 yahi bhaan yadi samaapt ho jaave yaa kam ho jaave or vyakti swayan kii yaa vaataavaran kii jaruraton ke mutabik kaam na kare to use achetan kaha ja saktaa he
 We call this unconsciousness with names like unconsciousness, unconsciousness or coma
 aam logon kii bolchaal main moorchha kii kalpana thodi khaas kism kii hoti he
 As if a person is like dead, eyes closed, speech closed, hands and feet are loose, devoid of reaction
 parantu drushti se achetanta yaa moorchha ke or bhi anek str va rup ho sakate hai
 Although this work is the work of a doctor, yet the common man, after considering certain things, can estimate very little about the presence of unconsciousness, its seriousness and its reasons
 sabase pehle yah tay karnaa hoga ki jagaane ke prayatnon kaa marij par kya asar padataa he ? jor se awaajen lagaakar, naam pukaar kar, haath-paanv hilaakar, kahin dard paidaa kar, marij kii pratikriya dekhi jaave
 Does he open his eyes, speak, speak correctly, clench his limbs from pain, save

 What is the position of his limbs? They can be either loose-fitting, loose or hard and jerky like epilepsy

 Body color, temperature, pulse, breathing are all normal

 Diagnosing hysteria unconsciousness is often difficult for doctors
 is avasthaa main yaa to marij ajeeb harakatein kar saktaa he yaa lambe samay tak chuppi sadhakar aankhe band rakh saktaa he
 There is no question of danger or worry in this
 moorchha sirf ek lakshan he
 Simptum is unconsciousness is not a disease in itself, but can appear as a symbol of many diseases
 bimaariyaan chaahe jo hon, moorchha ke liye antim rup se jimmedaar ang he hamaara dimag yaa mastishk
 It is the mind or brain in which we maintain consciousness and remain conscious
 alag-alag kaarnon se mastishk kaa kaam gadabada saktaa he
 Unconsciousness can come from both the diseases of the mind itself and the diseases of other organs of the body besides the brain
 dimag kii swayan kii bimariyon ke udhaaharan hai- pakshaaghaat yaa perelysis kaa bada atake jisamen mastishk ke bahut bade yaa khaas samvedansheel hisse ke khun kii saplaay main rukaawat aa jaati he
 Brain hemorrhage means a rupture of a blood vessel in the brain, an infection in the brain - such as meningitis and encephalitis

 Head injury
 anya angon kii bimaariyaan jo apratyaksh rup se mastishk par asar daal kar moorchha paidaa kar sakati he unke udhaaharan hai- jahrili davaaiyon kaa upyog, oxygen kii kami-dam ghutana, band cameraa, pani main doobana, dhuna yaa jahrili gas

 BIG STATUS OF DIABETES
 jigar yaa liver kaa fail jo janaa
 Typhus with high fever
 moorchha ke kaaran chaahe jo hon, kuch nishchit upaay praathmik chikitsa ke rup main kiye ja sakate hai
 The most important thing is to be patient
 murchhit vyakti ko dekhakar swayan ghabara janaa to hosho havaas kho baithne ke baraabar hoga
 Not every unconsciousness is dangerous
 anek baar uski avadhi bahut choti hoti he va marij swayan hosh main aa jaataa he
 Hysteria unconsciousness is not dangerous at all
 murchhit vyakti ko khuli hawa main rakhana chaiye yadi vah band ghutate hue vaataavaran main paaya gaya ho to
 Efforts can be made to stop bleeding from any organ
 taapmaana bahut tej ho to thande pani main bhigoe gaye kapadon se sharir geela rakhaa jaataa he
 The main thing is to remove obstruction in the way of breathing

 It is important to clean the throat

 Somewhere the holder of the new east has also been considered as a forward
 upachaar se inke vachanon ko bhi aagam kaha gaya he
 As long as Agam Bihari Muni existed, it was not so important, because till then the conduct of the conduct of the Munis was directed by the Agam Munis
 jab aagam muni nahin rahe, tab unke dwaara rachit aagam hi sadhana ke aadhaar maane gaye or unamem nirdisht nirdesan ke anusaar hi jain muni apni sadhana karte hai
 The term Agam is used for literature in Jain philosophy

 ek kendriya praadhikaran, utsarjit kiye ja sakane vaale pradooshak kii maatra par ek seemaa yaa cap nirdhaarit karata he
 Emissions permits are issued to companies or other groups and are required to hold an equal number of exemptions that reflect the right to a specific amount of emissions
 chhot or credit kii kul maatra, seemaa se adhik nahin ho sakati, jo kul utsarjan ko us str tak ke liye simit kar detii he
 For companies that need to increase their emissions rebates, it is necessary that they purchase credits from those who pollute less
 in chhuton kaa sthanantaran vyapaar kehalaata he
 In response, the buyer is paying a fee for pollution, while the seller is being rewarded for reducing emissions more than necessary
 is prakaar, siddhant rup main, jo log utsarjan ko sabase saste tareeke se kam kar sakate hai ve aisa karenge, samaaj par nunatam asar ke saath pradooshan main kami ko praapt karnaa
 There are active trade programs in various air pollutants

 The United States has a national market for reducing acid rain and nitrogen oxides have several regional markets
 anya pradooshkon ke liye bazaar apekshaakrit chote or adhik sthaniyakrut hua karte hai
 The overall goal of an emissions trading plan is to minimize the cost of achieving the set emission target
 cap, utsarjan par pravartaneey seemaa he jise aamtaur par samay ke saath kam kiya jaataa he - jisaki disha ek rashtriya utsarjan lakshya kii ore hoti he
 In other systems it is necessary to return a portion of all credits traded, leading to a net reduction in emissions at the time of each trade
 kai cap and trade pranali main, jo sanghathan pradooshan nahin failaate hai ve bhi bhaag le sakate hai, is prakaar paryaavaran samooh chhot yaa credit ko kharid sakate hai or nivrutt kar sakate hai or is prakaar maang ke niyam ke anusaar bache hue kii keemat ko badha sakate hai
 Corporations can also donate the rebates to a non-profit institution and return them prematurely and then be eligible for a tax deduction
 arthshaastriyon ne, paryaavaran sambandhi samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye nideshaatmak "aadesh or niyantran" viniman ke bajaay, "bazaar-aadhaarit" upkarnon ke prayog kaa aagrah kiya he jaise ki utsarjan vyapaar
 aadesh or niyantran viniman ke atyadhik kathor, praudyogikeey or bhugolic bhinnataaon ke prati asamvedansheel or aprabhavakaari hone ke kaaran aalochana kii gai he
 However, to effectively cut emissions, emissions trading requires a cap and the cap is a government regulatory mechanism
 ek sarkari raajnneetik prakriya dwaara ek seemaa ko nirdhaarit kiye jane ke baad, vyaktigat companiyaan yah chunaav karne ke liye mukt hai ki kya or kitna ve apane utsarjan ko kam karengi
 Failure to reduce emissions is often punished by another government regulatory mechanism, a penalty that increases the cost of production
 pradooshan viniman kaa paalan karne ke liye companiyaan sabase kam laagat vaale tareeke ko chunegi, jo katautee ko prerit karegaa jahaan sabase kam mahange samaadhaan hon, jabaki un utsarjan kii anumati degaa jinhen kam karnaa adhik mahangaa he
 The efficacy of this air pollution control approach, later called "cap-and-trade", was demonstrated in a series of micro-economic computer pseudo-studies
 ise 1967 or 1970 ke bich naishanal air paulushan control administration ke liye ke liye ellison bartan or wiliam sanjorn dwaara kiya gaya
 These studies used mathematical models of different cities their emission sources to compare the cost and efficacy of different control strategies
 katautee kii prayek ranneeti kaa, ek computer anukulan program dwaara nirmit "nunatam laagat samaadhaan" se milan kiya jaataa he taaki die gaye ghataav lakshya ko praapt karne ke liye nunatam laagat vaale strot katautee ke sangyojan kii pahchaan kii ja sake
 In each case, it was found that the minimum cost solution was dramatically cheaper than any conventional reduction of the same amount of pollution resulting from the traditional strategy of reduction
 isane "cap and trade" kii avadharana ko, katautee ke die gaye str ke liye "nunatam laagat samaadhaan" praapt karne ke ek upaay ke rup main prerit kiya
 The evolution of emissions trading in the order of history can be divided into four stages: textbook utsarjan vyapaar kaarykram ko ek "cap and trade" drushtikon kaha ja saktaa he jisamen sabhi sroton par ek samgr cap sthapit kiya jaataa he or phir in sroton ko aapas main vyapaar karne kii anumati di jaati he taaki yah nirdhaarit kiya ja sake ki koun se strot vastav main kul pradooshan bhaar failaate hai
 An alternative approach with significant differences is a baseline and credit program
 ek aadhaar-rekha or credit kaarykram pradooshak main jo ek samgr cap ke tahat nahin hai, apane utsarjan ko utsarjan ke ek aadhaar-rekha str se neeche pahunchaate hue credit bana sakate hai, aamtaur par jise ofaset kaha jaataa he
 Such credits can be purchased by pollutants that have a regulatory limit
 yah sambhav he ki koi desh aadesh or niyantran drushtikon kaa upyog karte hue utsarjan ko kam kar le, jaise viniman, pratyaksh or apratyaksh kar
 vibhinn deshon main is drushtikon kii laagat alag-alag he kyonki marginal abetment cost karv - pradooshan kii ek atirikt ikai ko samaapt karne kii laagat - deshon ke anusaar bhinn
 ek ton CO2 ko samaapt karne main china ko $2 lag saktaa he jabaki sweden yaa america ko shaayad isse zyada lage
 International emissions trading markets were created to take advantage of different macs
 ek saral utsarjan caping skim kii tulana main, gains from trade ke madhyam se vyapaar utsarjan, vikreta or khariddaar, donon ke liye adhik phydemand ho saktaa he
 Consider two European countries, such as Sweden and Germany
 Both countries can either reduce the entire required quantity of emissions themselves or they can choose to buy or sell it in the market
 is udhaaharan ke liye ham yah maan lete hai ki sweden kii tulana main germany kaaphi kam laagat se apane CO2 main katautee kar saktaa he, udhaaharan, MACS > MACG jahaan sweden kaa MAC vakr germany kii tulana main adhik gaharaa he or rrequwsarjana kii kul maatra he jise ek desh dwaara kam kiye jane kii jarurat he
 To the left of the graph is the MAC curve for Germany
 rreq, germany ke liye aavashyak katautee kii maatra he, lekin rreq par MACG vakr, CO2 kii bazaar chhot keemat se pratichchhed nahin karata he 
is prakaar, CO2 chhot ke bazaar mulya ke aadhaar par, germany ke paas adhik labhanvit hone kii sambhaavna he yadi vah utsarjan main aavashyaktaa se adhik katautee karata he
 On the right is the MAC curve for Sweden
 rreq, sweden ke liye katautee kii aavashyak maatra he, lekin macs vakr, rreq tak pahunchane se pehle hi CO2 chhot ke bazaar mulya ko pratichchhed karata he
 Thus, given the market discount price of CO2, Sweden has the potential for cost savings if it cuts emissions, less than what is required internally, and rather cuts them elsewhere
 is udhaaharan main, sweden utsarjan main tab tak katautee karegaa jab tak iskaa MACS p ke saath pratichchhed na kare, lekin isse sweden kii kul aavashyak katautee se keval thodaa hi ansh kam hoga
 He can then purchase emission credits from Germany at a p value
 bazaar main germany se khride gaye credit kii keemat ke saath sanyukt, sweden kii apni katautee kii aantarik laagat, sweden ke liye aavashyak kul katautee tak pahunchati he
 Thus Sweden can save by purchasing credit in the market
 yah "gains from trade" ko darshata he, atirikt kharch kii raashi jise sweden ko anyathaa kharch karnaa padataa agar usne bina vyapaar kiye apane kul aavashyak utsarjan ko khud kam kiya hota
 Germany made a profit on its additional emissions reductions, above what was required: it met the rules by cutting all emissions, as expected
 iske alaava, germany ne apane adhishesh ko credit ke rup main sweden ko bech diya or use katautee kii gai prati ikai ke liye p kaa bhugtan praapt hua, jabaki usne p se kam kharch kiya
 His total revenue is the area of the graph, his total deduction is the cost area and hence his net profit from selling the emission credits is the area i
e
 Gains from Trade do R* vyapaar se utpann hone vaale kushal aavanton ko darshaate hai
 If the total cost of cutting the specific amount of emissions in the command control scenario is X, then in deducting the same amount of combined pollution in Germany and Sweden, the total reduction cost will be lower in the emissions trading scenario, ie
 uparokt udhaaharan na sirf rashtriya str par lagu hota he: balki yah bhinn deshon main sthit do companiyon par, yaa phir ek hi company ke bheetar do sahaayak companiyon par bhi lagu hota he
 The nature of pollutants plays a very important role when policy makers decide which framework should be used to control pollution
 CO2 vishwa str par kaary karata he, is prakaar dharti par chaahe jahaan kahin bhi ise choda jaae, paryaavaran par iskaa prabhaav samaan he
 Environmentally, the place of origin of the emission does not really matter
 nitigat dhaanche, kshetreey pradooshkon ke liye alag-alag hona chahie, kyonki ho saktaa he in pradooshkon kaa prabhaav sabhi sthanon main ek jaisaa naa ho
 a regional pollutant of the same quantity can have a very high impact in some locations and a low impact in other locations, so it really matters where the pollutant is being released
 ise hot spot samasya ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 a Lagrange framework is typically used to determine the minimum cost of achieving an objective, in this case the total reduction in emissions required in a year
 kuch maamalon main, prayek desh ke liye aavashyak katautee kaa nirdhaaran karne ke liye lagarange anukulan dhaanche kaa upyog karnaa sambhav he, taaki katautee kii kul laagat ko nunatam kiya ja sake
 In such a scenario, the lagrange multiplier represents the market discount price of the pollutant, such as the current market discount price of emissions in Europe and the United States
 sabhi deshon ko us bazaar chhot keemat kaa saamana karnaa padataa he jo us din bazaar main maujuud he, taaki ve aise vyaktigat nirnay lene main sakasham rahe jo unki laagat ko nunatam kare, jabaki niamak anupaalan ko bhi saath-saath praapt kare
 yah sam-seemaant-siddhant kaa ek anya sanskaran he, jise aam taur par aarthik rup se sarvaadhik kushal nirnay ke chunaav ke liye arthshaastra main prayog kiya jaataa he
 There is a longstanding debate over the comparative merits of price versus quantity devices to achieve emission reductions
 ek utsarjan cap or permit vyapaar pranali ek maatra saadhan he, kyonki yah samgr utsarjan str ko thik karti he or keemat ke bhinn hone kii anumati detii he
 Uncertainty in future demand and supply conditions, coupled with a certain number of pollution credits, brings uncertainty in the future price of pollution credits and the industry must accordingly bear the costs of adapting to these volatile market conditions
 is prakaar, ek asthir bazaar kaa boj udyog ke saath nihit hota he, na ki niyantran agency ke saath, jo aam taur par adhik kushal hoti he
 However, under volatile market conditions, the control agency's ability to change the cap will be transformed into the ability to choose "winners and losers" and thus presents an opportunity for corruption
 iske vipareet, ek utsarjan kar ek mulya saadhan he kyonki yah keemat ko nishchit kar detaa he jabaki utsarjan str ko aarthik gatividhiyon ke anusaar badalane kii anumati he
 a major drawback of an emissions tax is that environmental consequences are not guaranteed
 ek taraf ek kar, sambhawatah kisi upyogi aarthik gatividhi ko dabaa kar udyog se puunji ko nikaal degaa, lekin iske vipareet, pradooshak ko bhavishya kii anischitata ke khilaaf bahut adhik hichkichane kii zarurat nahin he kyonki kar kii raashi laabh ke saath chalegi
 ek asthir bazaar ke boj ko, swayan udyog ke bajaay niyantran agency vahan karegi, jo aam taur par kam kushal hoti he
 One advantage is that, in a uniform tax rate and in a volatile market, the taxing institution will not be in a position to choose "winners and criminals" and there will be fewer opportunities for corruption
 yah maanate hue ki koi bhrashtachar nahin he or yah maanate hue ki niyantran agency or udyog bazaar kii asthir sthitiyon ke anuroop dhalane main samaan rup se kushal hai, sabase acha vikalp laabh kii samvedansheeltaa kii tulana main, utsarjan main kami kii laagat kii samvedansheeltaa par nirbhar karata he jab utsarjan niyantran kaa str bhinn he
 Since companies have high uncertainty in compliance costs, some argue that the price mechanism is the optimal choice
 haalanki, anischitata kaa boj, samaapt nahin kiya ja saktaa he or is maamle main yah tex agency main hi sthanantarit ho gaya he
 Some scientists have warned of a limit in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide beyond which extreme heat effects can occur, leading to irreparable damage
 yadi yah ek bodhgamy jokhim he to ek maatraatmak saadhan ek behatar vikalp ho saktaa he kyonki utsarjan kii maatra ko nischitata ke ek ucch str ke saath roka ja saktaa he
 However, this risk may not be true if it exists, but it cannot be associated with known levels of GHG concentrations or known emission pathways
 suraksha valve ke rup main gyaat, ek teesraa vikalp, mulya or maatra sadhano kaa ek sankar he
 The system is basically an emission limit and permit trading system but the maximum allowable price is limited
 pradooshan failaane waalon ke paas yah vikalp he ki ve chaahe to bazaar se permit hasil kar len yaa phir sarkaar se ek nirdisht trigar mulya par khariden 
 nai jaankaree ke prakaash main aane par sarkaar ko is pranali ko samyojit karne kaa lacheelaapan dekar, donon pranaaliyon kii moulik kharabiyon par kaabo paane ke ek tareeke ke rup main kabhi-kabhi is pranali kii sifarish kii jaati he
 It can be demonstrated that by keeping the trigger price high enough or the number of permits low enough, the safety valve can be used to mimic the net quantitative or net price mechanism
 sabhi teen tareekon ko, greenhouse gas utsarjan ko niyantrit karne ke liye nitigat saadhan ke rup main upyog kiya jaataa he: EU-ETS ek maatraatmak yojana he jo neshnal alokeshan plance dwaara nirdhaarit lakshyon ko hasil karne ke liye cap or vyapaar pranali kaa upyog karti; denmark main ek mulya pranali he jo carbon tex kaa upyog karti he, jabaki china apni clin deveopment maikenism pariyojnaon ko vittposhit karne ke liye CO2 bazaar mulya kaa upyog karata he, lekin CO2 ke prati ton par nunatam mulya kaa ek suraksha valve lagaataa he
 Carbon leakage is the effect that one country's / sector's emissions regulation exerts on emissions of other countries / sectors that are not covered by the same regulation
 There is no consensus on the magnitude of long-term carbon leakage
 kioto protocol main, anulgnak i desh utsarjan kii seemaa ke adheen hai, lekin gaiyr-anulgnak i desh nahin hai
 Barker et al
 Evaluated the literature on leakage
 risaav dar ko is rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he ki yah deshon ke baahar gharelu shaman karrwai karne vaale CO2 ke utsarjan main vruddhi ko gharelu shaman karrwai karne vaale deshon ke utsarjan main kami se bhaag dena he
 Accordingly, a leakage rate of more than 100% would mean that domestic actions to reduce emissions have resulted in substantially increased emissions in other countries, that is, domestic mitigation actions have actually driven the increase in global emissions Have done kioto protocol ke tahat karrwai kiye jane vaale risaav dar kaa anumaan, mulya pratispardhaa main haani ke parinamswaroop 5 se 20% ke bich he, lekin in risaav daron ko bahut anishchit hone ke rup main dekha gaya

 Several flaws in the design have limited the effectiveness of this scheme
 In the initial 2005–07 period, emission limits were not rigid enough to indicate significant reductions in emissions
 The total allocation of exemptions exceeded the actual emissions
 isse carbon kaa mulya 2007 main shunya ho gaya
 This over-supply reflects the difficulty in predicting future emissions that is necessary for establishing a range

 NZ ETS, sabhi-kshetron kii sabhi-gaison kii tivrata aadhaarit utsarjan vyapaar yojana hogi
 
 An intensity-based ETS is an ETS in which allocation is based on companies' current production rates rather than historical emissions

 During this period, the price of New Zealand emission units will be limited to NZ $ 25
 In addition, emissions equivalent to two tons of carbon dioxide would need to be submitted to the same unit, effectively reducing the cost of emissions to NZ $ 12

 An early example of an emissions trading system is the SO2 trading system in the United States under the Acid Rain Program Framework of the 1990 Clean Air Act, then the Trade Emissions Trading System
 Under this program, which is essentially a cap-and-trade emissions trading system, emissions were reduced by 50% in 2007 from the 1980 level

 The United States federal budget of 2010 proposes support for clean energy development with an investment of US $ 15 billion per year, for which it will raise funds from the sale of greenhouse gas emissions credits
 Under the proposed cap-and-trade program, all GHG emissions credits will be auctioned, thereby generating an estimated $ 78

 akshay urja pramaan patr, yaa "green tag", kuch america rajyon ke bheetar akshay urja ke liye hastantaraneey adhikaar hai
 For a renewable energy provider, a green tag is issued for its energy production of every 1,000 kwh
 is urja ko vidyut grid main bech diya jaataa he or praaanpatr ko laabh ke liye khule bazaar main bechaa ja saktaa he
 They are purchased by companies or individuals to show that a part of their energy is with renewable sources and is voluntary

 However, this is one way through which an organization can purchase its energy from a local provider that uses fossil fuels, but holds a certificate in its support that supports a specific air or hydroelectric project
 carbon utsarjan vyapaar, vishesh rup se carbon dioxide ke liye utsarjan vyapaar he or vartmaan ke utsarjan bazaar kaa ek bada hissaa is par aadhaarit he
 It is also a way by which various countries can discharge their obligations to reduce carbon emissions under the Kyoto Protocol and thus reduce global warming
 carbon utsarjan vyapaar, haal ke varshon main lagaataar badha he
 According to the Carbon Finance Unit of the World Bank, 374 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents were exchanged through projects in 2005, 240% more than in 2004, 41% higher than in 2003 itself
 dollar ke sandarbh main, Felipe de Jesus Garduño Vazquez vishwa bank kaa anumaan he ki carbon bazaar kaa aakaar 2005 main 11 bilian USD tha, 2006 main 30 bilian, or 2007 main 64 bilian tha
 The Marrakesh Accords of the Kyoto Protocol defined the international trade regime and the necessary registries to support trade between countries, where exempt trade is now taking place between European countries and Asian countries
 jabaki ek raashtra ke rup main, america ne protocol kii pushti nahin kii, uske kai rajya ab cap-and-trade pranali ko viksit kar rahe hai or apane utsarjan vyapaar pranali ko aapas main jodne ke tareeke kii khoj kar rahe hai, rashtriya or antarrashtriya str par, sabase kam laagat kii talash or bazaar kii taralata main sudhaar
 haalanki, ye rajya, apni vyaktigat nishtha or anuthi visheshtaon ko bhi sangrakshit karnaa chaahate hai
 For example, unlike other Kyoto-compatible systems, some states propose limiting the access to other types of sources of greenhouse gas, different measurement methods, determining the maximum at discount prices, or CDM projects

 The 23 multinational corporations came together on the G8 climate change roundtable, a trade group formed in January 2005 at the World Economic Forum

 britain kaa vyapaar jagat, jalwaayu parivartan ko kam karne ke liye ek mahatvapurn upkaran ke rup main utsarjan vyapaar ke samarthan main zordaar tareeke se saamne aayaa he, jiskaa samarthan gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon ne bhi kiya he
 However, not all businesses have supported a business approach
 11 disambar 2008 ko rex tilorsan, iksonmobil ke CEO ne kaha he ki ek carbon tex, cap-and-trade kaarykram kii tulana main "ek adhik pratyaksh, adhik paardarshee or ek adhik prabhavi drushtikon he" jo unhone kaha, "nishchit rup se anaavashyak kharch or jatilta utpann karata he"
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki unhen aashaa he ki carbon tex se praapt rajasav kaa istemaal anya karon ko kam karne ke liye kiya jayega taaki vah rajasav tatasth bana rahe
 The stance of the International Air Transport Association, whose 230 member airlines make up 93% of all international traffic, is that business must be based on "norms" that will determine emissions levels based on industry averages, not Based on "grandfathering" that uses individual companies' past emission levels to determine their future exemptions
 unka tark he ki grandfadaring "un airlinon ko dandit karegaa jo apane jahaazon ko aadhunik banane ke liye sheeghra karrwai karenge, jabaki ek maandand drushtikon, agar thik se taiyaar kiya jaae to adhik kushal sanchalanon ko puraskrit karegaa"
 An emissions trading system requires measurement at the level of the operator or installation
 in maapan ko iske baad ek niamak ko suchit kiya jaataa he
 For greenhouse gases, all trading countries maintain a list of emissions at national and establishment levels; In addition, trade groups within North America maintain inventory at the state level through the Climate Registry
 kshetron ke bich vyapaar ke liye, samakaksh ikaayiyon or maap takneekon ke saath sangat honi chahie
 In some industrial processes, emissions can be physically measured by placing sensors and flowmeters in the chimney and stack, but many types of activity depend on theoretical calculations for measurement

 Another important, yet difficult aspect is enforcement
 Without effective MRV and enforcement, the value of exemptions decreases
 pravartan ko kai tareekon se kiya ja saktaa he, jisamen shaamil he jurmaana yaa jinhone apni chhot kii seemaa ko laangha he unhen puraskrit karke
 chintaaon main shaamil he MRV or pravartan kii laagat or yah khatra ki suvidhaon kaa prayog vaastavik katautee karne ke bajaay gumraah karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he yaa apni kami ko puraa karne ke liye kisi anya sanstha se chhot yaa ofaset kharidne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 The real impact of a corrupt reporting system or a poorly managed or funded regulator can be in the form of discounts on emissions and an increase in actual emissions
 nordahouse ke anusaar, kioto protocol kaa sakht pravartan, un deshon or udyogon main dekhe jane kii sambhaavna he, jo EU ETS dwaara aavruth hai
 Ellermann and Buchner have commented on the role of the European Commission on the enforcement of permit shortages within the EU ETS
 ayog ne aisa, permit kii kul sankhya kii samiksha dwaara kiya, jo sadsy rajyon ne apane udyogon ke aavanton ke liye prastaavit kiya tha
 Based on institutional and enforcement considerations, Krueger and others suggested that emissions trading in developing countries may not be a realistic goal in the near term

 Criticisms utsarjan vyapaar ke aalochakon main shaamil hai paryaavaran sanghathan, arthshaastri, shram sanghathan or ve log jo urja kii aapurti or atyadhik karadhaan ke bare main chintit hai
 In the popular science journal New Scientist, Lowman has argued that pollution abatements should be avoided in trade because they result in accounting failures, questionable science, and the devastating effects of projects on local people and the environment
 loman ne un paaramparik viniman, harith kar or urja nitiyon kaa samarthan kiya he jo "nyaay-aadhaarit" or "samudaay chaalit" hai
 According to the Transnational Institute, carbon trading has a "disastrous history
" " EU ETS kii prabhaavashiltaa kii aalochana kii gai or yah tark diya gaya ki CDM ne niyamit rup se "paryaavarniya drushti se aprabhavi or saamaajik rup se anyaaypurna pariyojnaon" kaa samarthan kiya he
 Offsets europea paryaavaran samooh, FERN ke van prachaarak jutta kil kaa tark he ki utsarjan katautee ke liye ofaset, utsarjan main vaastavik katautee kaa vikalp nahin hai
 Kil said that "trees are temporary: trees can easily release carbon into the atmosphere through fire, disease, climate change, natural decay and timber harvesting"
 permit kii aapurti There is a risk of regulatory agencies issuing too many emission credits, which could result in lower prices on emission permits
 This reduces the incentives that permit-indebted companies have to cut their emissions
 duusari ore, bahut kam permit jari karne se permit kii keemat main bahut zyada badhotaree ho jaati he 
 sankar upkaran ke paksh main yah ek tark he, jisaki ek mulya-sataha he, yani ek nunatam permit mulya or ek mulya-seemaa, yani, permit keemat par ek seemaa
 ek mulya-seemaa, tathaapi, utsarjan kii ek vishesh maatra kii seemaa kii nischitata ko hataa detii he 
 Encouragement utsarjan vyapaar vikrut protsaahan main main falit ho saktaa he
 For example, if emissions permits are given free of charge to polluting companies, this would be one of the reasons they would not cut their emissions
 aisa isliye he kyonki utsarjan main badi katautee karne vaali company ko sambhavit rup se bhavishya main kam utsarjan permit pradaan kiya jayega 
 is vikrut protsaahan ko kam kiya ja saktaa he agar permit kii nilaam kii jaae, yani, permit ko muft main dene ke bajaay, pradooshkon ko use bechaa jaae 
 On the other hand, the allocation of permits can be used as a measure to protect domestic firms from competition at the international level
 This is when domestic firms compete against other firms that are not subject to the same rules
 permit ke aavanton ke paksh main die jane vaale is tark ko EU ETS main prayog kiya gaya he, jahaan udyogon ko antarrashtriya str par khulaa paaya gaya, udhaaharan ke liye, cement or ispaat utpaadan ko muft main permit diya gaya he

 This was the second major war fought by Babur after the Battle of Panipat
 is yuddh ke kaarnon ke vishay main itihaaskaaron ke anek mat hai
 First, since the agreement at Babur and Rana Sanga before the Battle of Panipat, Sanga was to assist in Babur's military campaign against Ibrahim, which led to the latter retracting
 doosraa, sanga babar ko dilli kaa badshaah nahin maanate the
 Unlike these two reasons, some historians believe that this war was the result of the ambitious plans of Babur and Rana Sanga

 In order to increase the enthusiasm of his soldiers, Babur announced a ban on drinking and selling liquor and vowed not to drink alcohol by smashing all the characters of alcohol, he declared not to take 'tamga Kar' from the Muslims
 tamgaa ek prakaar vyapaarik kar tha jise rajya dwaara lagaaya jaataa tha
 In this way, Babur achieved success against Sanga using the strategy of Panipat war even in the war of Khanwa
