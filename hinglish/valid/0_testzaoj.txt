 Wolf is a fictional character, one of the leading heroes of Indian comics publisher Raj Comics
 bhediya kii rachana dhiraj verma ne disambar 1993 ke dinon main kii thi
 In 1997, the comics of Kobi and Wolf were published by Digital Colors for the first time in India
 takreeban pachaas hajaar saal purv, vulphano naamak ek ganraajya hua karata tha, jiske nivasee behad viksit prajati ke bhediya-maanav rahaa karte the, jo shaktishaalee hone saath dopaaye chalate bhi the
 Their king, Wolfa, was also a wolf-human, who falls in love with Princess Survaya, a human damsel
 vah maanav ganraajya konkani kii rajkumaari thi
 In spite of all the instructions of his Gururaj Bhatiki, Wolfa marries Survaya on the strength of the magical captivating garland and thus the couple gets Kobi
 pachaas varsh guzarate he or sanyogvash ek durghatana main kobi par laga vah shaap mitata he or swayan ko assam ke jangal main paata he
 Then he starts a new life called "wolf"
 ab bhediya kii pahchaan vishaal kad ke saath ghaney aayal, lambii poonch or chamakdaar ankhon se janaa jaataa
 He would very much protect the forest dwellers and in return the forest dwellers considered him a wolf-god
 sabakaa madadgaar or aparaadhiyon ke bich kaal ke taur par log use "jangal kaa zallaad" ke naam se pukaarte
 The wolf is his master, Bhatiki, who teaches him how to fight
 phir bhaatiki do bhaagon main bhediya ko "kobi" or "bhediya" main vibhajit karata he
 Bhatiki orders his disciple Kobi to return to Wolfano
 magar unki yah cheshtaa asafal hoti he
 Meanwhile, both the human part wolf and the animal part Kobi try to marry Jane, in which no one agrees to leave the forest
 in 10 saalon main kobi assam ke jangalon main nivas karte hue, apane ilaake ko kai khataron se bachaata he, magar kai baar apni morrkhtaa ke chalate musiibat main faste bhi he
 Despite being almost the same body part of a wolf and a coby, the personalities are completely different in nature
 jahaan kobi jaahil, murkh or ugr swabhaav kaa he to vahiin bhediya vyaavhaarik taur par paripakv evam budhimaan he
 The tribals respect the wolf and consider him their protector, while trying to avoid becoming a partisan of Kobi's anger or anger, although at times Kobi would have avoided trouble in the jungle, but only on his own terms
 shaareerik sanrachana :lambaai- 8'0bhaar- 154 kg
shaareerik sanrachana :lambaai- 8'0bhaar- 138 kg
shaareerik sanrachana :lambaai - 6'6bhaar- 122 kg
 Coby can increase the length of his wonderful tail as he wishes, and he also uses it as a powerful weapon
 vahiin atyant khatarnaak paristhitiyon main vah apane bhediya dev kaa aahvaan karata he, jahaan uski "madad" swaroop ek ghaatak gada prakat hote hi vah virodhiyon ke parakhche uda daalata he
 Whenever Kobi calls upon a wolf army of help, the whole area is covered in a moment
 ye bhedie bhi use apana dev maanate tathaa use puujate
 Coby has his "wolf-faced plaque" that gives him the strength to recover, but not immediately
 asal main uske paas aisi teen divya aabhushan he jo uski shaktiyon kaa strot hai; ek kanthhaar, 2 kalaiyon ke kade ke jode or ek bhediya mukh pattica
 The wolf is a fierce warrior who, like the original Coby, possesses inherited dueling skills
 bhediya kai pracheen kaushal tathaa yudhkala kaa jaankaar he or usne isi bal par kobi ko kai baar haraaya bhi he
 We can see obvious abnormalities in Coby and Wolf
 bhediya behad budhimaan, vyaavhaar kushal evam maanviya gunon se paripurna he to kobi apni pashu buddhi, uddandata, aakraamak or gussell swabhaav ke kaaran kukhyat he
 Despite both, Gururaj Bhatiki specializes in teaching duality
 apane puure jivan bhediya or kobi kai gaiyr kanoonee taskaron, shikari evam van mafia se bhidate rahen he
 Some of his major rivals and enemies, which include Elephanto, Tantanna, Andhadhundh, Kaigula, Kalnami, Pratal, Eclipse, King Luna and Sniper
 raaj kamiks ne kobi-bhediya tathaa jine ke trikoniya prem ko lekar ek sirij jari kii, yahaan in teenon ke prati prem or ateet main hue bhediya kii ankahi premakatha ke antardvandv ko lekar buna gaya he
 The two comics of this series also mention the incident where the wolf, after training his Gurmitra Bhokal to penetrate the tilism, delivers his wife Turin as a Dakshina
 iske uparaant prem aadhaarit shrankhla kaa naam "amar prem" rakhaa gaya tathaa tag line par ise "kaanton bharaa antaheen safar" kaha gaya
 It is also known as the longest syringe in the history of Raj Comics
 is shrankhla main maujuud sabhi ishuon ke naam kramvaar kiye gaye hai: Dheeraj Verma used to write and depict early wolf comics
 lekin zyaadaatar pehle kii kamiks or abhi tak kaa lekhan tarunkumar wahi hi karte rahe the
 From the year 1998 to the present, Vivek Mohan / Sanjay Gupta would hand over the ideals of his scripts to Tarunkumar Wahi and Wahi ji would write those scripts in comics
 saal 2008 se jari amar prem shrankhla kii adhiktar chitrankan adil khan ne kiya
 At first Dheeraj Verma used to fully portray the two wolf issues, but later Dheeraj Verma started penciling, Rajing Dhoni did the rest of the inking work
 dhiraj verma ne varsh 1993-2002 tak bhediya kamikson kaa chitrit kiya
 However Verma ji was temporarily not in work till 2000-2001, and returned again after 2 months
 unke dwaara chhod is rikt sthaan par, artwork kaa kaary naresh ke jimme choda
 Dheeraj Verma permanently retired from Raj Comics after the year 2002
 magar 2013-14 ke aasapaas unhone kuch nimnlikhit kamikson jaise bhediya sirij kii jaljivani, raktbeej; doga siries kii ravan doga evam shubhasy shighram tathaa brahmad rakshak siries kii sarvanaayak ank evam aakhri rakshak main bhi kaary kiya

 ] Continental displacement is the movement of the continents of the earth in relation to each other
 yadi karodon varshon ke bhugolic yugon main dekha jaae to prathit hota he ki mahadweep or unke ansh samudr ke farsh par tike hue hai or kisi-na-kisi disha main bah rahe hai
 The concept of flowing continents was first revealed by Dutch scientist Abraham Ortelius in 1596, but in 1912 the German geologist Alfred Wegener developed it from independent studies
 aage chalakar plate vivartaniki kaa siddhant viksit hua jo mahadwipon kii chaal ko mahadwipiya pravaah se adhik acchhee tarah samajha paaya
 Abraham Ortelius, Theodore Christoph Lilienthal, Alexander von Humboldt, Antonio snyder-pellegrini, and others had already noted that the continents of both opposite ends of the Atlantic Ocean fit precisely into each other
 W
 J
 Kius described the idea of ortelius as: alfred vegener ne 1912 main yah pariklpana prastut kii ki mahadwipon ke tut kar pravaahit hone se pehle ve ekikrut bhoomikhand ke rup main the
 Wegener's theory was independent and more outstanding than that of his predecessors, with later Wegener crediting similar ideas to some older authors: Franklin Coxworthy, Roberto Mantovani, William Henry Pickering, and Frank Bursley Taylor
 udhaaharan ke liye: dakshini mahadwipon kii bhugarbheey samaantaaon se roberto mantovani ne 1889 va 1909 main yah anumaan lagaaya ki saare mahadweep pehle ek bahut bade mahadweep ke rup main ekatrit the ; vegener ne apane tathaa mantovani ke dakshini mahadwipon ke maanchitron main samaantaayen paayin
 jwalamukheey gatividhiyon ke kaaran hone vaale ooshmiya vistaar kii vajah se yah mahadweep tut gaya tathaa nae mahadweep ek duusare se dur pravaahit hone lage, kayonki daraar-kshetra, jahaan ab mahaasaagar hai, bhi badhate chale gaye
 For this reason Mantovani proposed the theory of the expanding Earth, which has since been shown to be false
 frank barsle tailor ne bina vistaar ke mahadwipiya pravaah ko prastaavit kiya, unhone 1908 main suzav diya ki mahadweep khatimay ke dauraan chandramaa ke gurutv bal se bumadhya rekha kii ore khinch gaye, isi kaaran himalay tathaa alps dakshin kii ore nirmit hue
 vegener ne kaha ki ye sabhi siddhant unke apane siddhant se kaaphi milte-julate hai, haalanki tailor kaa siddhant puri tarah se viksit nahin he
 Wegener was the first to use the term "continental flow" and the hypothesis was formally published that the continents somehow "flowed" and drifted away
 haalanki unhone mahadwipiya pravaah ke liye paryaapt sakshya die, parantu ve us bhautik prakriya kii vishwasaneey vyakhya nahin de paae jisaki vajah se yah pravaah utpann hua
 His suggestion that the continents be pulled by the centrifugal pseudo-force that arose due to the Earth's rotation or celestial solvation was rejected because calculations proved that this force was not sufficient for it
 polflukt pariklpana kaa paul sofus epstin dwaara 1920 main adhyayan kiya gaya or ise avishwasaneey paaya gaya
 There is now widespread evidence of continental flow
 vibhinn mahadwipon ke taton par milte-julate paudhe or pashuon ke jeevashm paae jane se aisa lagata he ki ve kabhi jude hue the
 An example of this is the discovery of fossils of Mesosaurus, a freshwater reptile that resembles a small crocodile in Brazil and South Africa; Another example is the fossil of a ground reptile named Lystrosaurus from contemporary rocks from various places in South America, Africa and Antarctica
 kuch jivit sakshya bhi hai - is donon mahadwipon par ek jaise kuch pashu paae jate hai
 For example, some families / species of some earthworms are found in Africa and South America
 dakshin america or africa ke saamne ke bhaagon kii poorak vyavastha spasht he, lekin yah ek asthaayee sanyog he
 In millions of years, the slab stretch and ridge pressure and other forces of tectonophysics will move and rotate these continents further away from each other
 These temporal features prompted Wegener to study what he defined as continental flow, although he did not survive until his hypothesis was accepted by the people
 dakshin america, africa, madagascar, arab, bharat, antarctica, tathaa australia main permo-carbonipheras himand talachat kaa vrihad vitaran mahadwipon ke pravaah kaa ek bada pramaan he
 The continuous glaciers formed by the Oriented glacial series and the taillights salt deposits confirm the existence of a very large continent Gondwana which is considered to be the central element of the theory of continental flow
 ye shrinkhlaayein aadhunik nirdeshaankon main bumadhya rekha se dur hoti hui tathaa dhruvon kii ore jaati hui himandeey bahaav ko darshaati hai, saath hi yah bhi pradarshit karti hai dakshini mahadweep bhootkaal main naatakeey rup se alag sthanon par the tathaa ek duusare se jude bhi hue the
 Although it is now believed that continents move on the surface of the Earth - although their motion is direction-oriented rather than moving in a direction-oriented direction, this flow has not been accepted theoretically for many years
 ek samasya yah thi ki koi vishwasaneey lagane vaali chaalan shakti nahin dikh rahi thi
 Also, Wegener's not being a geologist was a problem
 1953 main kaire dwaara plate tecotronic siddhant kaa parichay die jane se paanch varsh purv - mahadwipiya pravaah ke siddhant ko bhautikashastri shidigar dwaara nimnlikhit aadhaaron par kaarij kar diya gaya tha
 It is now known that there are two types of crust on Earth, the continental crust and oceanic crust, where the first one is of a different structure and lighter in origin, both types of crust are located on a far deeper fluidized mantle
 iske alaava, mahasagariya crust ab bhi failte hue kendron par ban rahi hai, tathaa yah sabdakshan ke saath, platon kii pranali ko avyavasthit rup se chalaata he jiske parinamswaroop satat orogeni tathaa isostetic asantulan utpann hota he
 The motion of all these and continents can be better explained by plate tectonics

 tomb redar: chronicals main lara baar-swing karne tathaa jameen se unchi rengne vaali jagahon se kalabazi / role karne main sakasham thi
 Its stories are usually inspired by the discovery of a powerful artifact, where Lara has to work against the invisible forces who want to obtain this artifact for her own benefit
 ye shilpkritiyaan aamtaur par rahasyamayi shaktiyon kii maalik hoti hai tathaa alokik yaa phir duusari duniya kii bhi ho sakati hai
 The opposing forces in this series use these artifacts to create often frightening and mysterious monsters, creatures, and mutant animals that Lara must defeat throughout the campaign

 Funds for most expenses, including staff costs, state visits, formal commitments, and official entertainment, are met by the civic list itself

 James Palace still holds the record of being a senior palace, and is still a hostile residence
 yah mahal aaj bhi uttaradhikaar parishad kaa sabha-sthal he tathaa ise rajpariwaar ke anya sadasyon dwaara bhi upyog kiya jaataa he
 Other royal residences include the Clarence House and the Kensington Palace
