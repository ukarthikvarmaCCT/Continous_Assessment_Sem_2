 On the basis of this belief, Bell, with the help of his assistant Tomas Watson, started an effort to invent the telephone method and finally on March 10, 1876, he was able to make such an instrument that he sent a message to Watson
 Sent - Mr
 Watson, come here
 mujhe tumhaari aavashyaktaa he
 Around the same time, some other people in the United States were experimenting with the transmission of eloquence by Vidyudhi and Prof
 a scientist named Elisha Gray applied only to patent one of his instruments, just three hours after Bell was granted an application to patent his instrument

 In high-level beings, the actions of the major organs of the body are very specific, which makes it possible to understand them by paying attention to the subtle details of the actions
 )nimnlikhit mul prakritik ghatnaayen hai, jinase jeev pahachaane jate hai: Organization - This is more evident in higher level beings
 sanrachana or kriya ke vikaas main samantarata hoti he, jisase sharirkriyavidon kaa yah kathan siddh hota he ki sanrachana hi kriya kaa nirdharak upadan he

 In addition, the results of all physiologic experiments show substantial differences, depending on the individual nature of the disposable animals
 isiilie mahatvapurn samuchit niyantranon kaa or mahatvapurn parinaam kaa adhimulyan nahin hona chahie
 Ideal results are often considered to determine the outcome
 prayogon kii punraritiyaan aavashyak hai
 The error of observation, which is often small in the real sciences, is very high in biology, because of variable variability in observation due to variable individuality
 jis prakaar anya vigyaanon main parinaamon ko sankhyikee dwaara vivechit kiya jaataa he, vaise hi fiziology ko parinaamon kii sambhavita ke niyam kii prayukti se vivechit kiya jaataa he

 Although this method is the most fluid and highly behaved, it is unsatisfactory because it does not determine in what magnitude the deviation from the mean and how often is relative
 hamaare paas yah gyaat karne kaa koi saadhan nahin rah jaataa ki uparyukt udhaaharan main 4 karod 50 lakh saamaanya paraas ke andar he yaa nahin
 As a result, the practice of using more realistic means to express the results of statistics is increasing
 chunki kisi vigyaan kii vartmaan avasthaa ko samajhane ke liye uske vikaas kaa itihaas gyaat hona aavashyak he, isliye phiziology se ruchi rakhanevaale vyakti ke liye uske itihaas kii ruparekha se parichit hona aavashyak he
 As far as the development of the overall subject is concerned, it is a matter of keeping in mind that no part of science can develop separately, all parts depend on each other
 udaahranarth, ek nishchit seemaa tak sharir ke gyaan ke bina fiziology kii kalpana asambhav thi or isi prakaar bhautikee or rasayan kii ek seemaa tak viksit avasthaa ke bina bhi isaki pragati asambhav thi
 Below is a list of important names that have given the subject an epoch-making twist from time to time, considering the publication of 'fabrica humanis corporis' in 1543 AD by André Vicelius
 1795 i

 1874 i

 This was a temporary measure, but continuing the existence of a shared monarchy in the Indian political system was not in the true sense of a right for a sovereign nation
 aazaadee se pehle bharat ke aakhri british visarai lord mountbeton hi bharat ke pehle governor general bane the
 Soon he handed over the post to Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, who became the only Governor General of Indian origin
 isi bich dow rajendra prasad ke netritv main samvidhan sabha dwaara 26 navambar 1949 ko bhartiya samvidhan kaa masauda taiyaar ho chukaa tha or 26 janvari 1950 ko aupchaarik rup se samvidhan ko sweekaar kiya gaya tha
 This date had symbolic significance because on 26 January 1930, the Indian National Congress called for complete independence from Britain for the first time
 jab samvidhan lagu hua or dow rajendra prasad ne bharat ke pehle raashtrapati kaa pad sambhala to usee samay governor general or raja kaa pad ek nirvaachit raashtrapati dwaara pratisthapit ho gaya
 The move ended the status of a Commonwealth dominion of India
 lekin yah ganatantr rashtron ke rashtramandal kaa sadsy bana rahaa

 The motion should be passed by a majority of more than 2 / 3 of the total strength of the House
 phir duusare sadan main jane par is prastaav kii jaanch ek samiti ke dwaara hogi
 At this time the President can present his side either himself or through a lawyer
 doosraa sadan bhi use usee 2 / 3 bahumat se paarit karegaa

 The President will not change the judicial proceedings and judicial decision
 He will only give relief from judicial decision

 and also anti-rasa and non-opposing products

 There are three parts of phonology - the caricature, the instinct and the example on it
 kuch vidwaanon ke anusaar karika bhaag ke nirmaataa acharya sahruday hai or vrittibhag ke acharya anandavardhan
 Such scholars consider the last verse of the phonology to be the basis for the support of their quote
 lekin kuntak, mahimbhatt, kshemendra aadi aacharyon ke anusaar karika bhaag or vritti bhaag donon ke praneta acharya anandavardhan hi hai
 Acharya Anandavardhan also writes- yahan unhone apane ko dhwani siddhanth kaa pravartak bataaya he
 The word 'sahridaya' used in the earlier verses is not the name of any particular person, but is a signifier of the gentle people and should be considered only by Acharya Anandavardhan, the creator of both the Karka and Vritti

 In the history of Indian litterateurs, 'soundyallok' is an epochal book
 is granth ke dwaara dhwani-siddhanth kii udbhaavna or pratishtha karke anandavardhan ne sahityashastra ke kshetra main mahniyatam anjar or amar sthaan praapt kiya
 Later scholars of Abhinavardhana - Abhinavagupta, Mammat, Vishwanath, Panditraj Jagannath etc
 accepted and nurtured Anandavardhana's literary beliefs
 sahityashastra ke kshetra main anandavardhan ko vahi sthaan praapt he, jo vyakaranshastra ke kshetra main panini ko evam veydant ke kshetra main aadi shankaracharya ko praapt hua he
 Acharya Anandavardhana had paved a new path by turning the path of theological beliefs and criticism of the ancient era to himself
 panditraj jagannatha ne yah thik hi kaha he ki dhvanikaar ne alankaarikon kaa maarg vyavasthit evam pratishthit kar diya tha
 When in Sanskrit literature, the gross body of poetry, the word meaning and the meaning of speech, were considered the prestige of poetry in decorating poetry, Acharya Anandavardhana proposed that there are two types of meanings in poetry - recitation and transcendence
 vachya arth upama aadi alankaaron dwaara prasiddh ho chukaa he
 In the utterance of the Mahakavis, the current meaning keeps on descending the same kind of beauty, just like 'lavanya in the organs'
 yah pratiyaman arth hi kavy kii aatma he
 The poetry in which the meaning of beauty is in the main form, that poetry is the best
 usee ko dhwani kehete hai
 The use of the word sound by Anandavardhana and the establishment of the sound community was a new, uniquely important task
 dhwani kii sthapana kaa aadhaar vyanjana vritti dwaara pratiyaman arth kii pratiti he
 It is not the case that the belief in the seeming meaning has not been considered before the time of Anandavardhana
 anandavardhan se purv bhi alankaarikon ne kavy main vachya arth se bhinn pratiyaman arth ke astitv ko sweekaar kiya tha or is prakaar unhone dhwani ke maarg kaa sparsh kar liya tha
 But even after touching the path of sound, he did not explain it and Anandavardhana had to do this work

 unhone kalidas ke abhigyaan shaakuntalam kaa german bhashaa main anuwaad kiya
 Goethe had said about Abhigyan Shakuntalam- gete kaa 82 varsh lanbaa jeevankaal europea itihaas ke aise yug se sambandhit he jo badi badi krantiyon tathaa bhayankar uthal puthal kaa samay mana gaya he
 The beginning of his youth led to the rise of revolution in German literature, which resulted in a sharp opposition to old beliefs and literary principles and strongly supported the independence of the poet and artist and the revival of the old glory of national literature
 is ‘tufaani yug’ main kranti kii bhaavana ek prachand aandhi ke samaan prakat hui, jisane puraane vichaaron tathaa jarjar siddhanton ke khandhar dharashayi kar die
 After this, in the middle of his life, there was a storm of French political revolution which shook the walls of the old system and created a beautiful dream of golden age in the hearts of millions of people, although this dream proved to be just as momentary as that of Mrigamarika, because its womb This led to the emergence of Napoleon, whose fast-moving conquistadores established a kingdom of complete despair in place of hope in Europe

 The impression of all these experiences is evident in his works, as his sensitive heart was immediately affected by external conditions
 vah atyant bhaagyashaalee purush tha
 The shadow of lack never came in his life
 prakruti ne saundarya tathaa swasthya ke saath hi saath use bahumukhi pratibha kaa vardaan diya tha jisane use vibhinn kaaryakshetron main safal tathaa pratishthin banaaya

 Keeping these things in mind, it will not be difficult to understand that he strengthened and enriched all parts of German literature and made such a deep and wide impact that after that hardly any eminent German poet or artist was left untouched by him
 uski sabal lekhnee ne geetkavy, mahakavy, upanyaas, naatak, tathaa aalochanatmak prabandhon kaa prachur maatra main srijan kiya or usne kisi bhi vishay ko sparsh karke apni shakti, naveenta tathaa moulikta se aprabhavit nahin choda
 His personal experiences have been incorporated into Goethe's various works and the element that binds them all in one sutra is his personality which continues to evolve over time
 isliye yah kaha ja saktaa he ki uski vibhinnkaaleen kritiyon main uskaa naitik, bauddhik tathaa aadhyatmik charit nihit he
 During the spring time of life, his feelings were intense and simple and he expressed in simple but vigorous language which seemed to be the natural outgrowth of the emotional heart

 This means that he made a successful attempt to co-ordinate the opposing tendencies of his personality and all his literature and philosophy preaches the sacred duty of coordination in this way
 usne is baat par vishesh jor diya ki manushya kii antarmukhi pravriti hanikaarak he or ise bahirmukhi bananaa atyaavashyak he jisase vyakti tathaa samaaj, aatma tathaa bahya prakruti main swasth saamanjasy ho sake
 This fact is found in all his works
 uske geetkavy vyaktigat prem se aarambh hote hai parantu kalantar main manushya tathaa prakruti kaa drudh sambandh unka mukhya vishay hota he-vah prakruti jo brahmamay he or jiske saath maanav kii aatma kaa atoot sambandh he kyonki sristi ke vividh praani ekta ke sutara main bandhe hai

 Two of Goethe's later novels, 'wilhelm Mistar' and its later version, pave the way for the development of style as well as the harmony of the individual and society, and in the last book, the author succeeded the industrial-era social system and the problems inherent in it

 isaki rachana kaa itihaas ‘gete’ ke vikaas kaa itihaas he or naatak ke nayak kii jeevanakatha maanav aatma ke vikaas kii katha he
 'foust' is a pre-requisite character of medieval folklore, which Goethe considers a symbol of humanity

 The first phase is the love of an innocent girl whose end proves to be miserable, then her entry into society and after coming in contact with Helen, she reads the text of Karma's utility and finally in her development by owning a vast plot
 Closed ends his lifeline

 Goethe's sharp vision invented many elements whose evolved form became increasingly understandable over time

 congress ke duusare netaaon se alag, gandhiji videshi kapade nahin pahante the, angreji kii jagah zyada se zyada hindi kaa prayog karte the or sanathan hindu chintan kaa hi prayog raajnneeti main karte the
 These were some of the reasons that Gandhiji gained immense popularity
