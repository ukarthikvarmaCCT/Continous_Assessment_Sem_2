hard ground ko lagane kaa doosraa tarika taral hard ground dwaara he
 It comes in a keg and is applied on a plate to be carved with a brush
 hawa main khulaa rakhane par hard ground sakht ho jaataa he
 Some printers use oil / coal-based asphaltum or bitumen as hard ground, although bitumen is often used to protect steel plates from rust and copper plates from aging
 soft ground bhi taral rup main aata he or ise sukhaya jaataa he lekin yah hard ground kii tarah bilkul shushk nahin hota he or apana prabhaav chhod saktaa he
 After the soft ground is dried, the printer can use some materials on it such as leaves, objects, hand prints and similar items that pierce the soft ground and the plate below it comes out
 ground ko powder yukt rogin yaa spray paint kaa istemaal karte hue ek fine mist main bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 This process is called aquatint and helps to create tones, shadows and solid areas of color
 iske baad ek eaching sui yaa apak se dizin taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 The "acup" point can be drawn by a simple tempered steel etching needle at an angle of 45–60 degrees behind a carborundum stone
 "echap" usee siddhant par kaam karata he jisase ki ek fountain pen kii line ballpoint kii tulana main kahin adhik aakarshak lagati he: swelling main halkaa sa antar haath kii swaabhaavik harakat ke kaaran hota he jo line ko "garm" kar detaa he or haalanki kisi vyaktigat line main yah shaayad hi miltaa he, antim plate par kul milakar ek bahut hi aakarshak prabhaav chodta he
 It can be prepared in the same manner as an ordinary needle
 iske baad plate ko puri tarah se ek acid main dubaaya jaataa he jo ujagar kii gayi dhaatu ko saafe kar detaa he
 Ferric chloride can be used for etching on copper or zinc plates while nitric acid can be used for etching on zinc or steel plates
 vishesh prakaar ke gholon main 2 bhaag fecl3 main 2 bhaag pani or 1 bhaag nitric main 3 bhaag pani kaa hota he
 The capacity of the acid determines the speed of the etching process
 eaching kii prakriya ke dauraan mudrak gholne kii prakriya main taiyaar bulabulon or aparad ko hataane ke liye chidiya kii pankh yaa aisi hi kisi cheez kaa upyog karte hai, plate kii sataha se yaa plate ko samay-samay par acid ke tub main dubaakar nikaala ja saktaa he
 If the bubble is allowed to remain on the plate, it prevents the acid from harvesting in the plate where the bubble touches it
 tambe or steel kii tulana main jasta kahin adhik teji se bulbule paidaa karata he or kuch kalakaar apane printon main ek miki ve effect ke liye ek rochak golakaar bulbule-jaisaa gola taiyaar karne main iskaa upyog karte hai
 Zinc produces more bubbles more quickly than copper and steel and some artists use it to produce interesting round bubble-like circles within the print for a galaxy effect
 aparad ek buknidaar pighali hui dhaatu he jo nakkashi kiye gaye grouves ko bhar detaa he or yah acid ko plate kii khuli hui satahon main ek saamaan tareeke se kaate jane se roak detaa he
 Another way to remove the erosion from the plate is to place the carved portion of the plate on the plasticine balls or stones inside the acid, although one drawback of this technique is the failure of bubbles to come out and remove them immediately
 equatinting ke liye mudrak aksar lagbhag ek centimetre se teen centimetre chaude dhaatu ke ek test strip kaa upyog karte hai
 The strip is immersed in acid for a specific number of minutes or seconds
 iske baad dhaatu kii is pattee ko hataa diya jaataa he or acid ko pani se dhokar saafe kar diya jaataa he
 a portion of the bandage will be covered in the ground and then the strip will be dipped again in acid and this process will be repeated again
 After this, the ground will be removed from the strip and ink will be put on the strip and printed
 This will allow the printer to know the different degrees or depth of the carved shape and therefore the color capacity of the ink depends on how long the plate has been kept in acid
 plate ko acid se hataa diya jaataa he or acid ko hataane ke liye ise pani se dhoyaa jaataa he
 The ground is removed with a solvent such as turpentine
 tarpin ko aksar mithail yukt spirits kaa upyog kar plate se hataaya jaataa he kyonki tarpin chikna hota he or syaahi ke prayog evam plate kii printing ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Spit-biting is a process whereby the printers use acid on a plate through a brush in certain areas of the plate
 is uddeshy ke liye plate ko equatint kiya ja saktaa he yaa sidhe acid ke sampark main laayaa ja saktaa he
 This process is called "spite-baiting" because it uses saliva that was once used to dilute acids, although gum arabic or water is now commonly used
 ek plastic card, mat board kaa ek tukdaa yaa kapade kaa ek guchha aksar syaahi ko chhin linon main pravesh karaane ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The surface is then cleaned with a piece of stiff fabric called tarlatan and then cleaned with newsprint paper, some printers prefer to use the blade portion of their hand or palm at the base of their thumb
 Huh

 You can also use a folded piece of organza silk for final cleaning
 agar tambe yaa jaste kii platon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he to plate kii sataha bahut saaf ho jaati he or isiliye yah print main safed hota he
 If a steel plate is used, the natural teeth of the plate give the print a smooth background, similar to the effect of aquatinting
 iske parinaam swarup steel platon ko equatinting kii jarurat nahin hoti he kyonki acid main lagaataar dubaaye jane par plate kaa kramik anaavaran vahi parinaam degaa
 a moist piece of paper is placed on the plate and it is run through the press

 Conventional soft ground, which requires solvents to be removed from the plate, instead uses water-based relief printing inks
 syaahi paramparaagat soft ground kii tarah chhaapon ko praapt karti he, ferick chloride echent kaa pratirodh karti he, iske baavjood ise garm pani or soda aish ghol yaa ammonia se saaf kiya ja saktaa he
 Anodic etching has been used in industrial processes for more than a century

 This system uses less than 2 volts of electricity, exposing uneven metallic crystals in the carved parts resulting in excellent retention of ink and the quality of the printed image is parallel to conventional acid methods
 nunatam voltage ke vipareet dhruviyata mejontint plate ke saath-saath "steel fecing" tambe kii platen taiyaar karne kaa ek apekshaakrit saral tarika pradaan karata he
 Light-sensitive polymer plates allow photorealistic etching
 plate par plate saplir yaa kalakaar dwaara ek photo-sensitive coating kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Light is focused on the plate as a negative image to illuminate it
 photopolimar platon ko plate nirmaataaon ke nirdeshon ke anusaar yaa to garm pani main yaa phir anya rasayanon main daalkar dho diya jaataa he
 Areas of the photo-h image can be stomped-out before etching to separate the final image from the plate, or once the plate is carved, it is removed or lightened by scraping or burnishing
 
 ek baar jab photo- eaching kii prakriya puri ho jaati he to plate ko ek saamaanya integleo plate ke rup main dry point, agali eaching, engraving aadi ke liye kaam main laayaa ja saktaa he
 The end result is in the form of an intaglio plate that can be used like any other
 tamba hameshaa se ek paramparaagat metal rahaa he or ise eaching ke liye aaj bhi pasand kiya jaataa he kyonki yah ek saamaan tareeke se kataai karata he, banaavat ko acchhee tarah dhaaran karata he or saafe kiye jate samay syaahi ke rang ko nasht nahin karata he
 Zinc is cheaper than copper, so it is better for beginners, but it does not cut as cleanly as copper and it changes some colors of ink
 eaching substrate ke rup main steel kii lokapriyata bad rahi he
 Copper and zinc prices have made steel an acceptable alternative
 steel kii line gunvattta tambe se kuch kam acchhee hoti he lekin yah jaste kii tulana main behatar he
 Steel is a natural and advanced aquatint
 eaching kaa upyog mudrit circuit bordon or ardhchaalak upkarnon ke vinirmaan main ), kaanch par or sookshmdarsheey avlokan ke liye dhaatu ke namoonay taiyaar karne main bhi kiya jaataa he
 There are several ways for printers to control the effects of acids
 sabase aam taur par plate kii sataha ko ek sakht, momyukt "ground" se cover kar diya jaataa he jo acid kaa pratirodh karata he
 The printer then scraps the ground with a sharp point, exposing the metal lines that have been affected by the acid
 equatint ek aisa badlaav he jisamen ek khaas regin ko plate par ek saamaan tareeke se baant diya jaataa he, phir iske baad ek uniform lekin sateek ghanatv se kam ek screen ground taiyaar karne ke liye ise garm kiya jaataa he
 After etching, any exposed surface turns into a corroded surface
 vaise kshetra jo antim print main halke hote hai unhen acid bath ke bich varnishing dwaara sangrakshit kiya jaataa he
 Repeating the process of continuous varnishing and placing the plate in acid creates a toned area that is difficult or impossible to obtain by drawing on a waxy ground
 isamen chini yaa camp coffee ke ek seerup jaise ghol main maujuud diginon ko iske ek taral eaching ground yaa "stop out" varnish main lep kiye jane se pehle dhaatu kii sataha par paint kiya jaataa he
 Later, when the plate is placed in hot water, the sugar dissolves and leaves the image and comes out
 iske baad plate par nakkashi kii ja sakati he
 a mixture of clean acid and gum arabic that can be dripped, scattered, or painted on a metal surface to produce interesting results
 yah ek america mudrak rand hubsh dwaara 2006 main avishkaar kii gayi ek eaching takanic he
 Small particles of carborundum grit are mixed into an acid-resistant ground that is brushed onto the bare metal as usual and left to dry
 jab vah mishran suukh jaataa he to plate par metal stilas kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or is tarah kuch dhul kanon ko hataa diya jaataa he, jisase kii tambe ke maamuli kshetra acid main ujagar ho jaaen or nakkashi kii ja sake, antat ve mudran prakriya ke liye syaahi ko pakad lete hai
 Thus the texture of the image on the paper is similar to the drawing of charcoal
 plate par printing sataha ko syaahi se cover karte hue kii jaati he, iske baad tarlatan kapade yaa newsprint se sataha par lagi syaahi ko ragad kar hataaya jaataa he, jisase syaahi raf kiye gaye kshetron or linon main rah jaati he
 The wet paper is placed on a plate and operated by putting both into a printing press; Pressure brings the paper into contact with the ink and the image is transferred
 Unfortunately this pressure also spoils the image in the plate to some extent, smoothing the corroded areas and closing the lines; The copper plate is far better, so that several hundred prints of a well-carved image can be taken before the artist considers the defect too much
 waisi sthiti main kalakaar plate ko haathon se ek baar phir se nakkashi karke dubaara taiyaar kar saktaa he, anivaary rup se ground ko peeche kar or unki linon ko dubaara talashkar; vaikalpik taur par printing se pehle sataha kii suraksha ke liye ek sakht dhaatu se platon ko electro-plate kaa swarup diya ja saktaa he
 Zinc is also used because the time of carving as a soft metal is short, although this softening also causes the image to deteriorate rapidly
 fox-bite yaa "over-biting" eaching main aam he or yah acid kii kam maatra kaa prabhaav he jo ground se hokar ris jaati he jisase sataha par maamuli daag or jalan kaa nishaan utpann ho jaataa he
 This accidental malfunction can be overcome by surface smoothness and polish, but artists often leave the fox-bite or willfully using the plate poorly because it is used as a desirable mark of a process Is seen as "kya aap yahan aakar meri echings ko dekhnaa chahengi?", yah ek romantic muhaavara he jisamen ek purush kisi kalatmak cheez dikhaane ke bahaane ek mahila ko apane sthaan par bulaane kii koshish karata he

 is sandhi ke antargat antarctic ko ek vaigyanik sangrakshit kshetra ghoshit kar diya gaya or is mahadweep par kisi bhi prakaar kii sainik kaarywai par pabandi laga di gai

 Time management is said to be carefully arranged and the time taken to perform different tasks
 samuchit samay prabandhan se dakshata milti he, utpaadakta badhati he or kaary sahi samay par puure hote hai
 Evaluate yourself for time management
 Write daily things in a diary
 This will tell you how much time you give to useful work and how much time you give to useless and useless tasks

 iske liye ek diary main kiye jane vaale kaaryon ko likhen yani suchi banaaen or jaisaa aapane tay kiya he uske anusaar usee kram or samay ke anusaar apane kaaryon ko karte jaaen
 yojana banaate samay aapako apane kaaryo kii praathamikta swayan hi tay karnaa hoga ki kis kaam ko pehle karnaa he or kis kaam ko baad main karnaa he
 While doing the work, you should also assess the work whether the work is being done as you thought or not
 Time management does not mean that you will not make mistakes
 If you are mistaken, then immediately rectify it and proceed
 But this does not mean that you do wrong things, but it is necessary that you do the work on time and do the right thing
 Assessing your work while working will increase your ability to predict any task correctly and in the right time and your confidence will improve further the next time you do another job
 Remember here that laziness is the biggest enemy of time management

 Lactation or lactation or lactation describes the process of weaning the milk from the mammary gland, the process of feeding that milk to the baby, and the time it takes for a mother to breastfeed her baby
 yah prakriya sabhi maadaa stanpayi praaniyon main hoti he or manushyon main ise aam taur par stanpan yaa nursing kaha jaataa he
 In most species milk is released from the mother's nipples; However, milk is released from the stomach ducts of the platypus
 stanpayi praaniyon kii keval ek prajati dayak fruit chamagadad main doodh utpann karnaa nar kaa ek saamaanya kaary he
 Males can produce milk due to an imbalance of hormones in some other mammals
 is ghatana ko navjaat shishuon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he )
 Galactopoiesis is the maintenance of milk production
 is charan main prolactin or oxitosin kii jarurat padati he
 The main function of lactation is to provide nutritional and immune protection to children after birth
 lagbhag sabhi stanadhariyon main, lactation baanjhapan kii ek avadhi ko janm detaa he jo santan ke jivit rahane ke liye ishtatam janm antaraal pradaan karne kaa kaam karata he
 From the fourth month of pregnancy, the female or female body produces hormones that stimulate the development of the milk duct system in the breasts: garbhavastha ke paanchaven yaa chhathwein maheene tak stan doodh utpann karne ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai
 Lactation can also be induced without pregnancy
 garbhavastha ke uttarardh main mahila yaa maadaa ke stan lactogenesis ke pratham charan main pravesh karte hai
 This occurs when colostrum is formed in the breast, which is a thick and sometimes yellowish fluid
 is charan main projesterone kii atyadhik maatra kii vajah se doodh utpaadan main kaaphi rukawat aati he
 It is not a medical concern if colostrum starts coming out of the breast of a pregnant woman before she gives birth to her baby and it is not a sign of future milk production
 janm ke samay prolactin kaa str ooncha rahata he jabaki garbhanal ke prasav ke parinamswaroop projesterone, estrogen or echpiel ke staron main achaanak giravat aa jaati he
 a sudden drop in progesterone in the presence of a high prolactin level leads to a fairly abundant milk production in the second phase of lactogenesis
 stan ke uttejit hone par rakt main maujuud prolactin kaa str badhane lagata he or lagbhag 45 minute main kaaphi upar chalaa jaataa he or lagbhag teen ghante baad doodh pilaane kii avasthaa main aane se pehle iskaa str waapas neeche gir jaataa he
 The release of prolactin stimulates the cells of the airway, causing milk to form
 prolactin stan ke doodh main bhi chalaa jaataa he
 Some research has shown that the quantity of prolactin in milk is very high at the time of excessive milk production and when the breast is full of milk it is less and its high level from two o'clock to six o'clock in the morning
 There is a possibility of mukhya rup se insulin, thyroxin or cortisol jaise anya hormone shaamil hote hai lekin abhi tak unki bhoomikaaon ke bare main puri jaankaree nahin mili he
 Although biochemical markers indicate that Phase II of lactogenesis begins about 30 to 40 hours after giving birth, but mothers typically breastfeed for 50 to 73 hours after giving birth
 Does not feel full
 apni maan ke stan se doodh pine vaale bachche ko sabase pehle doodh ke rup main colostrum praapt hota he
 It contains a much larger amount of white blood cells and antibodies than mature milk, and in particular, has a high level of immunoglobulin A, which acts to cover the lining of the baby's immature intestines, and invade microbes from the baby's system
 Helps prevent
 sravi iga se khaadya allergy ko rokane main bhi madad milti he
 The production of colostrum for the first two weeks after birth gives the breast milk the opportunity to mature slowly
 hormonal endocrine niyantran tantra, garbhavastha or janm dene ke baad pehle kuch dinon ke dauraan doodh utpaadan ko prerit karti he
 The autocrine control mechanism functions when the milk supply reaches a more robust state
 is charan ko lactogenesis kaa tritiy charan kehete hai
 During this stage, the more milk is produced from the breasts, the more milk is produced in those breasts
 shodh se yah bhi pataa chalaa he ki puri tarah se stanon se jitna zyada doodh nikalataa he, doodh utpann hone kii dar utani hi adhik ho jaati he
 In this way, the milk supply has a huge impact on how often the baby drinks milk and how well the milk gets out of the breast
 kam aapurti kii pahchaan aksar nimna baton se kii ja sakati he: The release of the hormone oxytocin results in a milk ejection or retraction reaction
 oxitosin stan ke aasapaas kii mansapeshiyon ko uttejit kar detaa he jisase stan se doodh nikalne lagata he
 Feeding mothers have described the feeling of breastfeeding differently
 kuch maataaon ko maamuli jhunjhuni kaa ehsaas hota he jabaki anya maataaon ko khub zyada dabaav yaa halkaa dard / bechaini kaa ehsaas hota he or aisi bhi kuch maatayen hai jinhen kuch alag mahasoos hi nahin hota
 The abandonment response is not always particularly consistent initially
 doodh pilaane kaa vichaar aane par yaa kisi bachche kii awaz sunai dene par yah riflex arthath pratikriya uttejit ho sakati he jisaki vajah se na chaahate hue bhi doodh kaa risaav hone lagata he yaa us vakt bhi donon stanon se doodh nikal saktaa he jab shishu kisi ek stan se doodh pi rahaa hota he
 However, such and other types of problems often go away after two weeks of weaning
 tanaav yaa chintaa kii vajah se doodh pilaane main kathinaayee ho sakati he
 Poor milk ejection response can be caused by a number of reasons, such as - wound or cracked nipples, separation from the infant, history of breast surgery, or tissue damage from prior breast trauma
 If a mother has difficulty in feeding, then she can be helped in many different ways that prove helpful in the milk ejection reaction
 in tareekon main shaamil hai: kisi parichit yaa aaramdaayak sthaan main doodh pilaanaa, stan yaa peeth kii maalish, yaa kisi kapade yaa snaan aadi ke madhyam se stan ko garm karnaa
 The increase of oxytocin may potentially stimulate the milk ejection reaction and may also cause uterine contractions
 doodh pilaate samay maataaon ko is tarah ke sankuchan kaa ehsaas ho saktaa he jise afterpens kehete hai
 It can also experience a lot of problems such as cramps, from minor discomfort to contractions, and may worsen with other and later children
 kuch mahilaon ke stan suukh or chatak jate hai or unamem khuli daraaren bhi pad jaati hai or doodh pilaane ke dauraan unase khun bhi nikal saktaa he
 Rubbing lanolin on the nipples and areola can relieve these problems
 jo mahila garbhvatee nahin he us mahila main "kritrim rup se" or jaanboojhkar doodh utpann kiya ja saktaa he
 This does not necessarily mean that the woman is pregnant and she can do this job well even in the post-menopausal period
 jo mahila kabhi garbhvatee nahin hui he vah bhi kabhi-kabhi doodh pilaane laayak kaaphi pariman main doodh utpann karne main sakasham hoti he
 This is called "induced lactation" ie "release of milk when excited"
 jin mahilaon ne pehle bhi stanpan karaayaa he unamem phir se doodh kaa nikalnaa shuru ho saktaa he
 This is called "reallocation" ie "re-milking"
 isi tarah se aam taur par ek poorak nursing system yaa kuch anya prakaar kii poorakta se shuru karne vaali kuch dattakagrahi maatayen stanpan kara sakati hai
 It is believed that there is little or no difference in the composition of milk whether the release of milk is artificially induced or as a result of pregnancy
 shaareerik uttejnaa or dawaaon dwaara bhi doodh nikal saktaa he
 In theory, milk can also be extracted only by sucking the nipples with great patience and persistence
 iske liye niples ko lagaataar uttejit karnaa pad saktaa he or inhen uttejit karne ke liye stan ko dabaanaa yaa vastav main chusane kii jarurat padati he or doodh ke bahaav ko badhaane ke liye stanon kii maalish kerani padati he or unhen nichodna padataa he
 Temporary use of galactagogue drugs is also effective; Galactagogue herbs may also prove useful
 ek baar sthapit ho jane par jarurat ke mutabiq doodh nikalnaa shuru ho jaataa he
 In addition, some couples may also use lactation for sexual purposes
 chikitsiya sahitya main nar lactation kaa shaayad hi koi vivaran miltaa he

 Whom the government feeds, in which 99% of the public is harmed, we say that the general public should stay away from it, if anyone wants to lose money, then they should be welcome in the stock and commodity market, this is more dangerous than alcohol, gambling etc
 If you are a gambler and an alcoholic, don't worry, if you want to lose weight, do not play with your children
 Die is definitely Play as-kinship Samprkwale stay away from close meet members is definitely Play ??? If you have not learned, then you have to play, then know about this market, 1 city is a move of shares etc
 You should see the move 2 Always buy below, should sell above and do not play without selling goods
 Always take the price at 5% of the highest rate
 Suppose the price of a share goes up to Rs
 1000, then wait for it to come up to Rs
 50
 Should come Will come down in 1 year, will change in 3 years to 5 years; 95% will fall in 1 year
 When the election starts, the market starts changing after the elections
 In about 3 years and 10 months, the market will be the highest
 Everything will be expensive
 After that, the temple will start, it will be very slow till 4 months before the election
 You can buy there, after 4 months of formation of the government, the market will start to pick up gradually
 Mandi will start after about 4 years fast
 This futures market goes on like this
 This is the same land - Makano raw material also runs in the commodity-futures market, which will be back at 33% of the price, no matter how expensive it is from the time of election
 You should invest 10% of your deposit capital in this market
 Not much, do not consider this business, this is a speculative, how does this speculative work? i tell you, on the computer, you see buyers and sellers on both sides, they are mostly fake
 And you keep buying and selling amongst each other, you think in the market The fast is slowing down while it is waiting
 When you buy or sell, the people will run contrary to the work that they will do in abundance, that is, the public plays the main role in bringing speed
 Their effort is, according to them, wherever the public thinks, the victory should be the same
 Because the people are not the same, they are the only things of the same plate
 Go against the work being done in abundance in the market
 At the rate at which 50% of the purchase is made, only when the second purchase is made, double the goods like 1 share price 50 rupees = 50 rupees = 2 share prices 25 rupees = 50 rupees = 4 share prices 12 rupees 50 paise = 50 rupees = 8 share prices 6 rupees 25 paise = 50 rupees = 16 share prices 3 rupees 15 pes = 50 rupees = 50 rupees = 32 share price 1 rupee 60 pes = 50 rupees, in this way you have 63 shares for Rs 300, the price of Rs 50 is almost Rs 6, you will never be beaten
 Will eat as trumped | First to come down from the maximum price of Rs 2300 in gold Must purchase Like === Maximum Price = 16040 -2300 = 13740 First Purchase
 Price should be doubled for second purchase at price 13740-2300 = 11440
 Price should be taken for the third purchase at the price 11440-2300 = 9140
 The goods should be bought 8 times at the price 9140-2300 = 6840
 The price should be 16 times the price to buy the fifth at 6840-2300 = 4540
 The same should be purchased in silver at a difference of Rs
 3000
 The price of gold and silver is 30 years, 10 years will be changed, 20 years will remain below copper glass gin nickel etc
 The gait is 7 to 8 years old
 No matter how expensive it will be from the time of election, you will definitely come back at 33% price
 No one has the magic of magic, never work at the behest of anyone
 If you are not aware of this market, then you would not have earned it yourself
 Why tell all losers who are gamblers! i believe that less capital can never win from this futures market if vaillaal main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke kadap jile kaa ek gaanv he

When intelligence was fully confirmed that Ram Prasad 'bismil', who was the leader of Hindustan democracy union, was not in the city that day, on the night of 26 September 1925, Bismil was arrested along with 40 people from all over India

 After the sacrifice of Bismil, this creation became the mantra of all revolutionaries
 jitani rachana yahan di ja rahi he ve log utani hi gaate the
 The desire for goodness is now in our heart, to see how much emphasis is on the side! Let the time come and tell you, o hope, what can we tell from now, what is in our heart! It has brought us hopeful of murder, loved ones
 Today the battle is in cooch-e-qatil! o shaheed-mulko-miltat, i am reliant on you, now your courage is discussed in a non-existent journey! Now neither are the next batsmen nor the crowd of desires, only the eraser Now in Dile-'bismil! paanch faraar krantikariyon main ashfak ulla khan ko dilli or shacheendra nath bakshi ko bhagalpur se police ne us samay giraftaar kiya jab kakori-kand ke mukhya mukademe kaa faisla sunaaya ja chukaa tha
 a supplementary case of the Kakori conspiracy was filed in the court of Special Judge JRW Bainet and on 13 July 1927, both of them hanged Ashfaq Ulla Khan and accused Shachindranath Bakshi of life imprisonment, accusing them of conspiring against the government
 She went
 seshan jaj ke faisle ke khilaaf 18 july 1927 ko avadh chif court main apil daayar kii gayi
 Both cases appeared before the Chief Justice of the Chief Court, Sir Louis Schutt and Special Judge Mohammad Raza
 jagatnarayan 'mullah' ko sarkari paksh rakhane kaa kaam saunpa gaya jabaki sajayaftaa krantikariyon kii ore se ke0si0 dutt, jayakarannath mishra va kripashankar hajela ne kramshah rajendranath lahidi, thakur roshan singh va ashfak ulla khan kii pairvi kii
 Ram Prasad 'bismil' made his own defense as he was given a simple lawyer named Laxmishankar Mishra at the government's expense, which he refused to take
 bismil ne chif court ke saamne jab dharapravaah angreji main faisle ke khilaaf bahes kii to sarkari vakil jagatnarayan mullah ji baglein jhaankate najar aaye
 At this, Chief Justice Louis Shirts had to ask Bismil in English - "mr
 Ramprasad! From bhich university you have taken the degree of la?" At this, Bismil had laughed and replied to the Chief Justice - "excuse me sir! a king maker did require an Anne degree
" " The trial of Kakori case was going on in Lucknow
 pandit jagatnarayan mullah sarkari vakil ke saath urdu ke shaayar bhi the
 He used the word "mulajim" instead of "muljiman" for the accused
 phir kya tha pandit ram prasad 'bismil' ne tapaak se un par ye chutili fabti kasi: "mulajim hamako mat kahiye, bada afsos hota he; adaalat ke adab se ham yahan tasharif laae hai
 We turn around with our juridis; That we have also lit lamps in the intestines often
 " unke kehane kaa matlab spashth tha ki mulajim ve nahin, mullah ji hai jo sarkaar se tankhwaah pate hai
 He is a political prisoner, so deal with him
 saath hi yah taakid bhi kii ki ve samudr tak kii lehren apane dussahas se palatney kaa dam rakhte hai; mukademe kii baaji palatnaa koun cheez? itnaa bolne ke baad kiski himmat thi jo unke aage thahartaa
 Mulla ji was left with sweat and he thought good in cutting the trowel
 ve chupchaap pichley daravaaje se khisak liye
 Then he did not cross-examine any other day
 aise hazirajabaab the bismil! The debate on cleanliness by Bismil caused sensation in the government section
 mullah ji ne sarkari vakil kii haisiyat se pairvi karne main anakani kii
 Therefore, the court rejected Bismil's plea for self-advocacy on 18 July 1927
 uske baad unhone 76 prishth kii tarkpurna likhit bahes pesh kii jise dekhakar jajon ne yah shankaa vyakt kii ki yah bahes bismil ne swayan na likhakar kisi vidhivetta se likhvai he
 Ultimately, the same Lakshmishankar Mishra was allowed to argue, which Bismil refused to take
 yah bhi adaalat or sarkari vakil jagatnarayan mullah kii mili bhagat se kiya gaya
 Because if Bismil were allowed to contest the entire case himself, the government would surely lose the case
 22 agast 1927 ko jo faisla sunaaya gaya uske anusaar ram prasad bismil, rajendranath lahidi va ashfak ulla khan ko ai0pi0si0 kii dfa 121 va 120 ke antargat aaajeevan karawas tathaa 302 va 396 ke anusaar phaansi evam thakur roshan singh ko pehali do dfaaon main 5+5 kul 10 varsh kii kadi kaid tathaa agali do dfaaon ke anusaar phaansi kaa hukum hua

 Finally, Barrister Mohan Lal Saxena prepared and sent documents of clemency petition in Privy Council to England's famous lawyer SL Polak, but the judges of London and the legal advisors of the emperor argued that Ram Prasad 'bismil was the architect of this conspiracy
 'if he is granted a pardon, he is a very dangerous and professional criminal, then he will be bigger and more dangerous in future
 Can e

 yah sach he ki unhone gair faujee angrezon ko apane ghar main panaah di, lekin unke samarthak bilkul na the, balki vah islamic shiksha va samskruti ke chaahane vaale the
 His vision was well aware of the conspiracy of the British

 casalare british-yri rajanyajna tha
 He is famous as Lord Kaslare
 kaslere 1812 se 1822 tak england kaa videsh mantri rahaa
 At the time of the merger of England and Ireland, he was appointed as secretary for Ireland on behalf of England
 rishwat aadi dekar ireland ke logon ko ireland or england ke ekikaran ke liye taiyaar karwaane main uskaa hi haath tha
 He was entitled to give some degree of religious freedom to the Catholic people
 vah kuch samay ke liye yuddh mantri or phir bastiyon kaa mantri rahaa
 He reorganized the army in 1807, but by him the army was rebuilt on the basis of the old army
 1809 i0 main usne apane pad se tyaag-patr de diya or canning se muqabla kiya
 In 1812, he became a foreign minister and he remained in this position until he committed suicide in 1822 AD
 casalare ek bahut hi budhimhan mantri tha jise kaalpanik vichaar dhokhaa nahin de sakate the or jo sidhe baat kii tah tak pahunch jaataa tha
 He was very brave and courageous not only politically but also personally
 usne hi nepolian ke viruddh mitrarashtron ko sangathit kiya
 The 'war of nations' started mainly with his efforts
 waterlu ke maidan main nepolian ko antim rup main parajeet karne main british sena kaa nirnaayak haath rahaa
 PS, surrender by Napoleon was also done before the British Navy
 in ghatnaon se britain kii pratishtha bahut adhik bad gai or 1814 i0 main europe main hone vaale anterrashtriya sammelan main use vahi sthaan mila jo 1819 main sanyukt rajya america ko praapt hua tha
 Dr
 Mahajan has written - "at that time England was the only country which had the power and means to fight and which also had the will to fight
 vah apane samay ke europe main bhaagyavidhaataa tha
 The credit for elevating England to a higher place is owed to Lord Castlere whose high ideals, solid behavior, intelligence, and divine genius for doing political work enabled him to do so
 vah keval angreji parliament or mantrimandal ke kaary karne vaale apane sah-karmchaariyon kaa hi vishwaasapaatr nahin, apitu europe bhar ke raajnneetigyon kii ichha sammatiyaan or vishwaas praapt karne main safal hua
 Castlere's only purpose in going to Europe and traveling to the Allied capitals was to organize these four large nations to compete against Napoleon
 saath-hi-saath vah ek aise anterrashtriya sangh kii sthapana karnaa chahta tha jo europe ke raajnneetigyon ke sammukh upasthit samasyaon ko sulajhaa sake
 In Castlere's view, the best way to overcome differences in the policy of nations, to win in war, and thus to collectively appear before the enemy in order to establish peace, is a confident and open exchange of ideas among the Prime Ministers of large nations
 - Was provided
 beesvin sadi main to anya rashtron se apni raksha karne ke liye kanyasense bulaakar yojanaayen banane kaa vichaar koi nayaa nahin prathit hota parantu casalare ke samay main aisa vichaar kranti machaa dene vaale kisi vichaar se kam nahin samajha jaataa tha
 In this one act, Castlere became famous as one of the greatest peace-makers in history
 casalare chaar bade-bade rashtron ko ek duusare ke nikat laane ke uddeshy se hi europe gaya tha or do maas ke andar-andar kii gai march, 1814 i0 kii shamont kii sandhi uski atyant mahatvapurn or ek badi baari safalataa thi
 Through this treaty, the four nations pledged to continue the war until France agreed to a settlement of peace
 in rashtron main se prayek rashtrane yuddh ke liye shastr aadi dene sweekaar kiye
 Along with arms, England also agreed to give 50 million pounds per year
 yah samjhauta bees varshon ke liye kiya gaya or mitra rashtron ne bees varshon tak france ke dwaara shaanti ke samjhauton kii shatod ko todane kaa praytn karne par samuhik rup se europe kii ore se france ke viruddh ladane kaa vachan diya
 Shortly after the signing of this treaty, Napoleon was deposed from the throne of France and negotiations of the agreement began in Paris
 “ vienna-congress main england ne austria, rus or prasha ke saath maitreepurn bhoomika adaa kii
 Lord Castlereau owed much to England for being elevated to such a high place, which not only had the confidence of the British Parliament and the Cabinet but also succeeded in gaining the confidence of the politicians of Europe
 navambar, 1815 main shaanti-sandhi ko taiyaar karne main casalare bahut mahatvapurn kaary kiya
 He received special assistance in this work from the Duke of Wallington, Metternich and Czar
 is sandhi kii ek choti dhara par vaad-vivaad ke samay casalare ko apni yojana ko kriyaatmak rup dene kaa avasar mil gaya
 These proposed politicians should be met from time to time, but Castlere changed the nature of this stream and greatly enhanced it in terms of words and expressions
 ab dhara kaa nayaa rup yah ban gaya-”is sandhi ko karyanvit karne ke kaary ko saral banane or isaki raksha karne ke liye tathaa sansar ke liye hitkar chaaron rashtron ke mail-milaap ko badhaane vaale sambandhon ko or bhi adhik drudh karne ke liye is sandhi main bhaag lene vaale mukhya desh yah sweekaar karte hai ki ve niyat samay ke baad sammelan bulaate rahenge
 Either the kings of these nations or their representatives will participate in the conferences to discuss their common interests and to take necessary and profitable steps in a timely manner and to re-enrich the countries and maintain peace in Europe
 “ casalare ke prayatnon se sandhi main jo dhara rakhi gai vah europe main shaanti sthapit karne kii disha main badi dein thi
 In this we get a glimpse of the declarations of the League of Nations and the United Nations
 europe kii sanyukt vyavastha kii sthapana bhi isi dhara ke aadhaar par ho saki thi
 Unfortunately, Castlere's hope did not fructify badly that the conventions governing Europe's disputes governed by this clause would be resolved and thus peace in Europe would prevail
 sammelnon dwaara samasyaon or vivaadon kaa faisla karne ke mahatv ko jitna adhik casalare samaj paaya tha, utana anya koi nahin
