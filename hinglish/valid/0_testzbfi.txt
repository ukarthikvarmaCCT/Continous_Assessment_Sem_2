 Bhagwandas is remembered for the traditional classification of impulses or ragas

 According to the sense of importance, equality and inferiority of the attachment, this raga or love takes the form of reverence, affection and kindness respectively and similarly, fear, anger and hatred take place in the face of hostility

 According to Dr
 Saheb's opinion, there are three types, three nature, human beings by their primacy: ye hue chaar varna
 These varnas are definitely found in any civilized society of a country, not with the same degree of divination and division of that work-price-comfort, religion-work-livelihood, as in India, ancient memories commanded them
 Have done jaise samaaj ke jivan main chaar mukhya peshey hai vaise hi prayek manushya ke jivan main chaar "ashram' hai: brahmacharya, vidya seekhney kaa, grihasth kaa, vanprastha kaa; sanyasi kaa
 Man has four efforts: Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha or Brahmananda
 pehle teen ashramon main adhiktar dharm-arth-kaam or chauthe main vishesh rup se moksh ko sadhana chahie
 Man is born with three debts
 in chaar rinon ke nirmochan niryaatan kaa upaay bhi chaar ashramon ke dharm karmo kaa uchit nirvaah hi he
 The debt of fathers is repaid by the production, rearing and nurturing of learning and child development
 yatha, vaayu devtaa se hamaara shwaas prashwaas chalata he, hawa ko ham ganda karte hai; uttam sugandhit padaartho ke dhoop-deep se, home havan se, hawa pun: svachh kerani chahie
 By cutting the forest, we spend on burning wood, building houses and goods

 Every day we spend the water of Varun Dev; New ponds, wells, canals etc
 should be constructed and filled
 ye sab yajna hai
 Whatever work is done for charity, all are sacrificial fires

 In order, four debts are paid in the four ashrams
 aisi hi teen yaa chaar eshnaayen, aakankshaayen, vasanaye manushya kii, swaabhaavik, hoti hai
 These four eschanas are also the metaphors of the four Purusharthos and are properly completed by the Dharma Karma of the four Ashramas

 Everyone also believes that the fruit of virtue is happiness and the fruit of sin is sorrow

 All religions have three parts, knowledge, devotion and action
 usuli "akayad" yani gyaancand or, "hakeekat' kii baaten to sab majahabon main ek hai hi, "ibaadatt' yani bhakticand or "tareekat' kii baaten bhi ek hi hai or "mamilaat' yani karmkand yaa "shariat' kii upree, satahi baaten bhi ek yaa ek si hai
 Four religions are considered in all religions: error, memory, virtue and heartburn
 khuda ko laa-makaan or niraakaar kehete hue bhi sabhi uske liye khaas khaas makaan banaate hai, mandir, masjid or carch aadi ke naam se
 Dr
 Bhagwandas has shown equality in the senselessness of followers of all religions

 Hand-held scanners, in which the device is moved by hand, evolved from "sticks" scanning the textual materials to 3D scanners used for industrial design, reverse engineering, testing and measurement, orthotics, games, and other applications
 is
 yantric rup se sanchalit hone vaale scanners, jo dastavej ko ghumaate hai, kaa prayog saamanytah bade-praaroop vaale dastavejon ke liye kiya jaataa he, jahaan flats-bed kaa prayog avyaavhaarik hoga
 Modern scanners typically use a charge-cupped device or a contact image sensor as the image sensor, while older drum scanners use a photomultiplier tube as the image sensor
 ek rotary scinar, jiskaa prayog ucch-gati se dastavej kii scanning karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, drum scinar kaa ek anya prakaar he, jisamen photomultiplir ke sthaan par ek CCD kii ek shrinkhalaa kaa prayog hota he
 Planetary scanners, which take pictures of books and documents, and 3D scanners, which are used to make three-dimensional models of objects, are other types of scanners
 scinar kii ek anya shrenee main digital camera scinar shaamil hai, jo reprographic camera kii sankalpana par aadhaarit hote hai
 Digital cameras have become an attractive alternative to normal scanners, with new features such as ever-increasing resolution and vibration resistance
 yadhyapi paaramparik scanners kii tulana main abhi bhi inamen kuch kamiyaan upasthit hai, tathaapi, digital camere kuch laabh bhi pradaan karte hai, jaise gati, suvahyata or kisi pustak ke jod ko haani pahunchaae bina mote dastavejon kaa saumy ankikaran karnaa
 New technologies combine 3D scanners with digital cameras to create a full-color, light-realistic 3D model of objects
 jaev-chikitsa anusandhan ke kshetra main, DNA sookshm-shrinkhalaaon kii pahchaan ke liye prayukt upkarnon ko bhi scinar kaha jaataa he
 These scanners are high-resolution systems similar to microscopes
 pahchaan kaa kaary CCD yaa ek photomultiplir tub ke madhyam se kiya jaataa he
 Scanners can be considered a successor to early telephotography input devices, which had a standard rotating drum of 60 or 120 rpm with a single photodetector
 ve maanak telephone dhwani ko le jane vaali taron ke madhyam se ek rekhiy analog AM signal bhejte hai, jo anupatik tivrata ko tulykaalik rup se ek vishesh kagaz par mudrit karte hai
 This system was used in the press from the 1920s to the mid-1990s
 rangeen chitron ko kramagat rup se chane hue teen pruthak RGB chitron ke rup main bheja jaataa tha, lekin sanchaaran laagat adhik hone ke kaaran inkaa prayog keval vishesh avasaron par hi kiya jaataa tha
 Unlike the charge-cupped-device chains found in flatbed scanners and cheap film scanners, drum scanners collect pictorial information with the help of photomultiplier tubes
 paravartansheel or sancharanshil mul kalakriti ek acrylik silinder, scinar drum, par rakhe jate hai, jo us samay bahut tej gati se ghumta he, jab scan kiya ja rahaa padaarth pmts tak chitra kii soochna pahunchane vaale shuddhta optics ke saamne se guzar rahaa ho
 Most modern color drum scanners use three matching pmts, which have red, blue, and green light, respectively
 mul kalakriti se utpann prakaash ko scinar ke optical bench par laal, nile or hare rang vaale teen pruthak kiran punjon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 The drum scanner is named after a clear acrylic cylinder, drum, on which the original artwork is kept for scanning
 inke aakaar ke aadhaar par, 11x17" tak aakaar vaali mul kalakritiyon ko is par rakh paanaa sambhav he, lekin adhiktam aakaar utpaadak par nirbhar hota he
 a unique feature of drum scanners is that they can control the sample area and orifice size independently
 sample aakaar vah kshetra hota he, jise padhakar scinar ancoder ekal pixel kaa nirmaan karata he
 The hole is the actual open space that allows light to enter the scanner's optical bench
 chhidr or sample aakaar ko pruthak rup se niyantrit karne kii yah kshamta shwet-shyaam or rangeen mul kalakritiyon ke negative ko scan karte samay film ke kanon ko chikna karne ke liye vishisht rup se upyogi hoti he
 While drum scanners are able to scan for both reflective and transmittance artifacts, a good quality flat-bed scanner can produce good scans from reflective artwork
 iske parinamswaroop, scan mudranon ke liye drum scanners kaa prayog bahut kam hi kiya jaataa he, kyonki ab ucch-gunvattta vaale, saste flatsbed scanners saralata se uplabdh hai
 However, drum scanners in film still remain the preferred equipment for high-grade applications
 chunki, geeli film ko bhi scinar par rakhaa ja saktaa he or pmts kii samvedansheeltaa asaadhaaran hoti he, atah drum scanners film kii mul kalakriti main se bahut sookshm vivaranon ko pakad paane main sakasham hote hai
 Only a few companies continue to produce drum scanners
 haalanki, pichley ek dashak main nai or upyog kii ja chuki donon prakaar kii icaayiyon ke daam kam hue hai, lekin abhi bhi inamen CCD flatsbed yaa film scanners kii tulana bhi ullekhneey maudrik nivesh kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 However the demand for drum scanners still remains as they have the capability to produce scans with high resolution, color gradation and price structure
 iske atirikt, chunki drum scanners 12,000 PPI tak rezolyushan main sakasham hote hai, atah unka prayog karne kii anushansa saamanytah tab kii jaati he, jab scan kiye jane vaale chitra kaa aakaar badhanaa ho
 In most painting works, extremely-high-quality flatbed scanners have replaced drum scanners because they are less expensive and more fast
 haalanki, abhi bhi drum scanners kaa prayog kisi sangrahalay jaisi gunvattta main chitron ke puralekhan or pustakon va patrikaon main ucch-gunvattta vaale vigyapanon ke prakaashan aadi jaise ucch-shrenee vaale anuprayogon main kiya jaataa he
 In addition, due to the high availability of previously used units, many fine-art photographers are taking drum scanners, creating a new market for these machines
 sabase pehla scinar ek drum scinar tha
 It was built in 1957 by a group working in the US National Bureau of Standards under the leadership of Russell Curse
 is mashin par scan kiya gaya sabase pehla chitra karsh ke putr walden, jinaki aayu us samay teen maah thi, kaa ek 5 varg semi kaa chitra tha
 The resolution on one side of this black and white image was 176 pixels
 ek flatsbed scinar saamanytah kaanch ke ek chaukor tukade, jiske neeche ek chamkila prakaash hota he, jo is tukade ko prakashit karata he or CCD scanning main gumti ek optical shrinkhalaa se milakar bana hota he
 ccd-type scanners typically have three rows of sensors with red, green, and blue filters
 CIS scanning prakaashan ke liye jhilamilahatpurna banaae gaye laal, hare or nile leds tathaa prakaash ke sangrahan ke liye isse jude ek ekal rang vaale photodod ke ghoomte samucchy se milakar bani hoti he
 The images to be scanned are placed face down on the glass, covered with an opaque cover to keep out the ambient light, and the sensor series and light source read the entire area of the square of the glass Pass through the piece
 atah iske dwaara paravartit prakaash ke kaaran chitra keval sansuchak ke liye hi drishyman hota he
 Transparent images do not work this way and require special aids to illuminate them from the top
 anek scanners ek vikalp ke rup main yah suvidha pradaan karte hai
 "slide" or negative film can be scanned into a device, which is specially manufactured for this purpose
 saamanytah chah fremon tak kii asampadit film patticaayen yaa chaar arudh slides ek vaahak main pravisht kii jaati hai, jise charanbaddh rup se chalanevaali ek motor dwaara scinar ke bheetar ek lens tathaa CCD samvedak ke aar-paar aage badhaayaa jaataa he
 Some models mainly use same-size scans
 hand scanners do prakaar ke hote hai: dastavej or 3D scanners
 hand-held dastavej scanners aise maanviya upkaran hote hai, jinhen scan kiye jane vaale chitra kii sataha par ghasita jaataa he
 Thus scanning the documents requires the hand to be stationary because having a disproportionate scanning rate will produce a distorted picture - a little light emitted from the scanner will indicate whether the speed was too fast
 unamem vishisht rup se ek "start" batan hoti he, jise prayokta dwaara scan ke dauraan pakadaa jaataa he; prakaashiya rezolyushan ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye kuch switch hote hai; or ek roller hota he, jo computer ke saath tulykaalan ke liye ek clock-pulse utpann karata he
 Most hand held scanners were monochromatic and emitted light from a series of green leds to illuminate the image
 ek vishisht hand scinar main ek choti khidki bhi hoti thi, jiske madhyam se scan kiye ja rahe dastavej ko dekha ja saktaa tha
 They were popular in the early 1990s and usually contained an interface module with specific ownership for a specific type of computer, usually an Atari ST or Commodore Amiga
 haalanki dastavej scanning kii lokapriyata ghat gai he, lekin hand-held 3D scanners kaa prayog anek anuprayogon ke liye lokapriy bana hua he, jinamein audyogic dizine, rewers ejineering, nirikshan evam vishleshan, digital utpaadan or chikitsiya anuprayog shaamil hai
 To compensate for the uneven motion of the human hand, most 3D scanning systems rely on the installation of reference marks — typically adhesive reflective tabs, which are used by scanners to align elements and mark positions
 vishisht rup se scanners shrinkhalaa se laal-hare-nile rang ke data ko padhate hai
 It is then processed by a proprietary algorithm to process this data according to different performance conditions and sent to the computer via the input / output interface of the device
 scanning shrinkhalaa kii visheshtaon ke aadhaar par rang ke gadhepan main antar ho saktaa he, lekin saamanytah yah kam se kam 24 bit hoti he
 High quality models have a color depth of 48 bits or more
 scinar ke liye ek anya arhata maapdand pixel prati inch main mapa jane vaala iskaa rezolyushan hota he, jiskaa ullekh adhik shuddh rup main aksar samples prati inch ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Instead of using the scanner's actual optical resolution, the only meaningful parameter, producers prefer to refer to the interpolated resolution, which is much higher due to software interpolation
 2009 ke anusaar, ek ucch shrenee vaala flatsbed scinar 5400 ppi tak scan kar saktaa he or ek achche drum scinar kaa optical rezolyushan 12,000 ppi hota he
 Often producers claim high interpolated resolutions of up to 19,200 ppi; But the significance of such data is very small because the number of possible interpolated pixels is unlimited
 nirmit kii gai file kaa aakaar rezolyushan ke varg ke saath badhata jaataa he; rezolyushan kaa maan doguna karne par file kaa aakaar chaar guna bad jaataa he
 Essentially a resolution must be chosen that is within the range of the device's capabilities, saves sufficient detail, and does not create files of too large size
 kisi diye gayi rezolyushan ke liye JPEG jaisi "kshatipurna " sampidan vidhiyon kaa prayog karke gunvattta kii kuch haani uthaakar file kaa aakaar kam kiya ja saktaa he
 If the best possible quality is necessary, lossless compression should be used; If required, a small size file of low quality can be made from such a picture
 ghanatv seemaa scinar kaa teesraa mahatvapurn maapdand hota he
 a higher density range means that the scanner can reproduce the details of the shadows and the brightness details in a single scan
 purna-rangeen ko 3D modelon ke saath sanyojit karke, aadhunik hand held scinar puure padaarth ko electronic rup se punarutpann kar sakate hai
 The presence of color 3D printers provides the ability for precise characterization of these materials in applications used in many industries and businesses
 dastavej kii scanning is prakriya kaa keval bhaag he
 The scanned image is useful only when it is transferred from the scanner to an application running on the computer
 There are two basic issues: how the scanner is physically connected to the computer and how the application receives information from the scanner
 ek scinar dwaara utpann data kii maatra bahut adhik ho sakati he: 600 DPI vaale 9"X11" ke ek 24-bit vaale asampeedit chitra main 100 megabite data hota he, jise anivaary rup se sthanantarit or bhandarit kiya janaa chahie
 Recent scanners can generate such an amount of data in a few seconds time, due to which a faster combination is desired
 scanners apane host commuter se nimnlikhit main se kisi ek bhautik interphes kaa prayog karke samvaad karte hai, jinhen dhime se teevr ke kram main rakhaa gaya he: In the early nineties, commercial flatbed scanners aimed at commercial users

 This proved to be very useful, for example, for publishers, printing sites, etc
 nabbe ke dashak ke madhya ke baad yah kaaryaatmakataa dhire-dhire samaapt ho gai kyonki prayek varsh bitake ke saath hi flatsbed scanners adhik vahan karne yogya hote gaye
 However, in 2000 and beyond, all-in-one multi-purpose devices aimed at serving both offices and consumers typically have a single printer, scanner, copier, and fax available in a single device for the entire workforce and each user Provide fax, scan, copy and print functionality
 adob photoshop jaise kisi anuprayog ke liye scinar ke saath sampark karnaa anivaary he
 Many scanners are available and many of them use different protocols
 anuprayog programing ko saral banane ke uddeshy se, kuch aplications programing interphes viksit kiye gayi the
 The API offers a similar interface for scanners
 iskaa arth yah he ki scinar tak pratyaksh abhigamyata ke liye anuprayog ko scinar ke vishisht vivaranon ko jaanane kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 udaahranarth, adob photoshop TWAIN maanak kaa samarthan karata he; isiliye saidhantik rup se photoshop TWAIN kaa samarthan karanevaale kisi bhi scinar se ek chitra praapt kar saktaa he
 In practice, when an application interacts with a scanner, many problems often occur during that time
 anuprayog yaa scinar ke utpaadak ke dwaara kiye gaye API kriyanvayan main koi truti ho sakati he
 Typically, the API is implemented as a dynamically joined library
 prayek scinar utpaadak aisa software pradaan karata he, jo API proscisger kol ko ek hardware niyantrak niyantrak) ko diye jane vaale samanya adeshon main anuvaadit karata he
 The productive part of the API is usually called a device driver, but this name is not entirely accurate: the API does not work in kernel mode and does not directly access the device
 kuch scinar utpaadak ek se adhik API pradaan karenge
 Most scanners use the TWAIN API
 TWAIN API, jise multah nimna-stareey or gharon main prayukt upkarnon main prayog kiya jaataa tha, ab bade-str par kii jane vaali scanning main vyapak rup se prayog kiya jaataa he
 Other scanner api's are the following pixel translations dwaara nirmit ISIS, jo pradarshan kaarnon se abhi bhi SCSI-II kaa prayog karata he, ko badi, vibhageeya-str kii mashiinon dwaara prayog kiya jaataa he
 SANE is a free / open source API for accessing scanners
 multah unics or linaks oparating systamon ke liye viksit, ise API OS / 2, mike OS x or microsoft vindos tak le jaaya gaya he
 Unlike TWAIN, SANE does not handle user interfaces
 This allows batch scans and transparent network access without any special support from the device driver
 vindos image aquizishan microsoft dwaara pradutt ek API he
 Although no scanner is a feature of any other software other than scanning utility, many scanners are still available in aggregated form with the software
 vishishtatah, scanning upyogita ke atirikt, kisi prakaar ke chitra-sampadan anuprayog or optical kairactor recognishan software pradaan kiye jate hai
 OCR software converts graphical images of textual content into a standard textual content, which can be edited using common word processing and textual editing software; However infallibility is seldom accurate

 parishkrut dastavej scanners main aisa formaware yaa software hota he, jo paathya-saamagree ke utpaadan ke saath hi uske scan ko saaf karata jaataa he or galati se lage daagon ko mitaakar aksharakriti ko tikshn banaata he; chitratmak kaary ke liye yah asweekaarya hoga kyonki usamen daagon ko vaanchit sookshm vivaran se vishwaspurvak alag nahin pahachaanaa ja saktaa
 nirmit kii ja rahi filon ko nirmaan ke saath hi sampeedit bhi kiya jaataa he
 The resolution used is typically between 150 and 300 dpi, although the hardware may be able to produce some higher resolutions; It produces images of textual content that can be read well by optical character recognition without demanding the high storage space required for high-resolution images
 sampadan-yogya tathaa khoji ja sakane yogya filon kaa nirmaan karne ke liye dastavej scan aksar OCR praudyogiki kaa prayog karke utpann kiye jate hai
 Most scanners scan documents using ISIS or TWAIN in TIFF format, so that they can be sent to a document management system that will handle the archiving and retrieval of scanned pages
 Damaged JPEG compression, which is very efficient for images, is undesirable for textual content as the skewed straight edges appear sharp and the dark black text on a light background is well compressed with lossless compression formats
 It happens

 The Shrutasutra is a Vedic text and is in fact the Kalpavidhana of the Vedic ritual
 shrautasutra ke antargat havan, yag, ishtiyaan evam satr prakalpit hai
 Aphrodisiac and parlokic fruits are obtained by them
 shrautasutra unheen vedavihit karmon ke anushthan kaa vidhaan kare hai jo shrout agni par aahitagni dwaara anushthey hai
 The word 'shrout' is derived from 'shruti'
 ye rachanaayen divyadarshi karmnishth maharishiyon dwaara sutarastyli main rachit granth hai jinpar parvarti yaajik vidwaanon ke dwaara pranit bhashya evam tikaayen tathaa tadupakaarak paddatiyaan evam anek nibandhgranth uplabdh hai
 Thus the available sutras and their commentaries adequately attest how prominent their place has been in Indian literature
 paashchaatya manishiyon ko bhi shrout sahitya kii mahatta ne adhyayan kii ore aavarjit kiya jiske falswaroop paashchaatya vidwaanon ne bhi anek anargh sanskaran sampadit kiye
 The major Shrutasutra texts are: shrutivihit karm ko 'shrout' evam smritivihit karm ko 'smart' kehete hai
 The method of ritual of Shrout and Smarta Karmas is controlled by Vedang Kalpa
 vedang chah hai or unamem kalp pramukh he
 Panini education calls him 'the hand of the Vedas'
 kalp ke antargat shrautasutra, grihyasutra, dharmasutra or shulbasutra samavisht hai
 These include the process of constructing the Yagyashala, Vedi, Mandapa and Kunda required in the legislation of Shrutasutra Srutakarma, the legislation of Grihyasutra Smrtakarma, the law of Dharmasutra topical ethics and the Karma for the purpose of Shulbasutra Karmanushthan
 shrautasutra ke anusaar anushthanon kii do pramukh sansthaayen hai jinhen havi:sanstha tathaa somsanstha kehete hai
 Smarta is the culinary institution on fire
 in teenon sansthaaon main saat saat prabhed hai jinke yoga se 21 sansthaayen prachlit hai
 Havis: In the institution, the deity is sacrificed for the purpose of special devotion
 somsanstha main shrautagni par somras kii aahuti kii jaati he tathaa pashwalanbhan bhi vihit he
 Therefore they are animal husbandry
 in sansthaaon ke atirikt agnichayan, rajasuya or ashwamedh prabhruti yag tathaa saraswatsatra prabhruti satr evam kamyeshtiyaan hai
 There are two major distinctions of Sroutakarma
 nityakarm jaise agnihotrahavan tathaa naimitikarm jo kisi prasangvash athwa kaamnavishesh se prerit hokar yajmaan karata he
 Yajman himself, along with his wife, is tortured by the aid of the Ritvijas
 yajmaan dwaara kiye janevaale kriyalap, rutvijon ke kartavya, prayek karm ke aradhy devtaa, yag ke upyukt dravya, karm ke ang evam upangon kaa sangopang varnan tathaa unka paurvapary kram, vidhi ke viparyay kaa praayshchitt or vidhaan ke prakaar kaa vidhiwat vivaran shrautasutra kaa ekmaatr lakshya he
 There are some karma prakritikarmas in the creations
 inke sangopag anushthan kii prakriya kaa vivaran shrautasutron ne pratipaadit kiya he
 The deeds whose main process is bound in the framework of the natural nature, according to the research of the particular fruit, only the specific deity or substance and period, etc
, are the only discourse, they are perverted, because according to Shrutasutra, this order has been given to 'do distortions like nature'
 is prakaar shrautasutron ke pratipaadya vishay kaa aayam gambhir evam jatil ho gaya he, kaaran karmanushthan main prayek vihit ang evam upang ke sambandh main die hue niyamon kaa pratipaalan atyant kathorta ke saath kiya janaa adrusht fal kii prapti ke liye anivaary he
 The association of the four Vedas in the ritual of Shrutakarma is anticipated
 rugveda ke dwaara hotrutv, yajurveda ke dwaara adhvaryukarm, samaveda ke dwaara udgaatrutiv tathaa atharvaveda ke dwaara brahma ke kaary kaa nirvaah kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, Shrutasutra belongs to Vedchatutashyay
 yajmaan jis veda kaa anuyaayi hota he us veda athwa us veda kii shakha kii pramukhataa he
 For this reason, in the Yajnya kalpa, according to every direction, they are discerned, which have the effect of acceptable characteristics like deshachar, kulachar etc
 is kaaran karmanushthan kii prakriya main kuch avaantar bhed shakhabhed ke kaaran chalaa aa rahaa he or har shakha kaa yajmaan apane apane veda se sambhddha kalp ke anushaasan se niyantrit rahata he
 Due to this tradition, the Shrutasutras are also segregated according to the main branch of Vedchatutashiyi

 Sher Shah had no place in history
 jaaysi sufi sant the or is rachana main unhone nayak ratansen or nayika padmini kii premakatha ko vistaarpurvak kehete hue prem kii sadhana kaa sandesh diya he
 Ratansen is a historical figure, he is the king of Chittor, Padmavati is his queen, on hearing of the beauty of which the then Sultan Alauddin invades Chittor to get it and although conquering the war, however, due to the death of Padmavati, he Is not able to achieve isi ardh aitihaasik katha ke purv ratansen dwaara padamavati ke praapt kiye jane kii vyavastha jodi gai he, jiskaa aadhaar avadhi kshetra main prachlit hiraaman sugge kii ek lokkatha he
 The story is summarized as follows: ratansingh rajput pehle se bhi vivaahit tha or uski us vivaahita rani kaa naam naagmati tha
 Against Ratansen, after suffering twelve months, he somehow sent his viragatha to Ratan Singh Rajput by a bird and was moved by this viragatha and returned to Chittor with Ratan Singh Padmavati
 yahan, uski sabha main raghav naam kaa ek tantric tha, jo asaty bhaashan ke kaaran ratansingh dwaara nishkasit hokar tatkaaleen sultan allaudin kii seva main ja pahunchaa or jisane usase padamavati ke saundarya kii badi prashansa kii
 On hearing the description of the amazing beauty of Alauddin Padmavati, he was eager to get it and he attacked Chittor for this purpose
 deergh kaal tak usne chittod par gheraa daal rakhaa, kintu koi safalataa hoti use na dikhaai padi, isaliye usne dhokhe se ratansingh rajput ko bandi karne kaa upaay kiya
 He sent a message of the treaty to him, which Ratan Singh Rajput accepted and came out of the citadel to bid farewell to Alauddin, Alauddin captivated him and departed towards Delhi
 chittod main padamavati atyant du:khee hui or apane pati ko mukt karaane ke liye vah apane saamanton gora tathaa badal ke ghar gai
 Gora Badal pledged to free Ratan Singh Rajput
 unhone solah sau doliyaan sajaayin jinke bheetar rajput sainikon ko rakhaa or dilli kii ore chal pade
 Arriving there, she said that Padmavati had come to the Sultan's service with her cherries and requested permission to meet her husband Ratansen for the last time
 sultan ne ajna de di
 The Rajputs sitting in the dolly freed Ratan Singh Rajput from fetters and they ran away with him
 sultani sena ne unka peechha kiya, kintu ratan singh rajput surakshit rup main chittod pahunch hi gaya
 While he was imprisoned in Delhi, King Devpal of Kumbhalner sent a messenger to Padmavati and offered him love
 ratan singh rajput se milane par jab padamavati ne use yah ghatana sunai, vah chittod se nikal padaa or kumbhalaner ja pahunchaa
 There he challenged Devpal to a duel war
 us yuddh main vah devpal kii cell se buree tarah aahat hua or yadhyapi vah usko markar chittod lautaa kintu devpal kii cell ke ghaav se ghar pahonchte hi mrityu ko praapt hua
 Padmavati and Nagmati performed the cremation with his corpse
 allaudin bhi ratansingh rajput kaa peechha karata hua chittod pahunchaa, kintu use padamavati na milakar uski chita kii raakh hi mili
 In this story, Jaisi has made such a beautiful combination of history and imagination, cosmic and supernatural that the second story in Hindi literature has not reached the height of "padmavat" in these qualities
 praaia: yah vivaad rahaa he ki isamen kavi ne kisi roopak ko bhi nibhaane kaa ytn kiya he
 Some versions of the composition also contain a verse, in which the entire story is described as a spiritual metaphor and states that Chittor is the body of a human being, the king is his mind, Sinhala is his heart, Padmini is his intelligence, Sugga is his guru
 Is, Nagmati is his cosmic life, Raghav is Satan and Alauddin is Maya; In this way, the meaning of the story should be understood
 kintu yah chand rachana kii kuch hi pratiyon main miltaa he or ve pratiyaan bhi aisi hi hai jo rachana kii pathparampara main bahut neeche aati he
 In addition, this key does not work everywhere throughout the composition: for example, the guru-chela-relation is not only in Sugge and Ratansen, it is in different contexts of composition, ratansen-padmavati, padmavati-ratansen and Ratansen and those with it It is also said among the Kumars who accompany him to Sinhala
 vastut: isi se nahin, is prakaar kii kisi kunjee ke dwaara bhi kathinaayee hal nahin hoti he or uskaa kaaran yahi he ki kisi roopak ke nirvaah kaa puri rachana main ytn kiya hi nahin gaya he
 The intended use of Jayasi is known to represent only love
 ve sthool rup main prem ke do chitra prastut-karte hai : ek to vah jo aadhyatmik saadhan ke rup main aata he, jiske liye praanon kaa utsarg bhi hanste hanste kiya ja saktaa he; ratansen or padamavati kaa prem isi prakaar kaa he : ratansen padamavati ko paane ke liye sinhalagarh main pravesh karata he or shuli par chadhane ke liye hanste hanste aage badhata he; padamavati ratansen ke shav ke saath hanste hanste chitarohan karti he or allaudin jaise mahaan sultan kii preyasi banane kaa lobh bhi asweekaar kar detii he
 The second love is that which Alauddin does to Padmavati
 duusare kii vivaahitapatni ko vah apane bhautik bal se praapt karnaa chahta he
 But Jayasi shows victory of first type of love and defeat of second kind of love
 doosraa unki drushti main hey or keval vaasana he; prem pehla hi he
 Jaisi calls this love divine

 The flying Spaghetti demon is the god of Pastafari religion
 ise america ke sarkari vidyalayon main intellegent dizine or crieshnism padhaane kaa virodh karne ke liye san 2005 main banaaya gaya tha
 Through this, it is shown that the burden of philosophical proof is on the person who is making a scientifically unjustifiable claim, rather than the person who is rejecting that claim
 haalanki is dharm ke anuyaayi ise ek asli dharm bataate hai, par media main ise ek vyangy dharm kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 The first description of the flying Spaghetti monster is found in a satirical letter written in 2005 by Bobby Henderson to the Board of Education of the State of Kansas, USA
 is chitthee se ve board dwaara vigyaan kii kakshaon main kram-vikaas ke sthaan par intellegent dizine padhaane kii anumati die jane kaa virodh kar rahe the
 In the letter, he satirizes Creationism by asserting his faith in a deity that looks like spaghetti and meatballs and the creator of the universe
 ve tark karte hai ki unki dharanaayen intellegent dizine kii dharanaon ke jitani vaid hai, or kehete hai ki isliye unki dharanaon ko vigyaan kii kakshaon main kram-vikaas or intellegent dizine ke baraabar samay milanaa chahie
 The flying Spaghetti demon is often used as a contemporary adaptation of Russell's teapot due to its popularity and reach
 iske madhyam se ye darshaya jaataa he ki darshanashastriy saboot kaa boj us vyakti par he jo vaigyanik drushti se jhoothaya na ja sakane vaala daawa kar rahaa ho, bajaay us vyakti ke jo us daawey ko asweekaar kar rahaa ho
 Although Henderson states that "the same religion is allowed in Pastafari religion - disallowance of religious beliefs", yet Pastafari people hold some beliefs
 pastafaari srijan myth ke anusaar ek adrishy or anbhigyeya udanevaale spagetti daanav ne bahut zyada sharaab pine ke baad brahmand kii rachana das hajaar varsh pehle kii thi
 According to these beliefs, the reason for the Earth to be flawed is the drunkenness of this demon during creation
 pastafaari ye bhi maanate hai ki kram-vikaas ke sabhi saboot pastafaariyon kii shraddha jaanchane ke liye swayan udanevaale spagetti daanav ne rakhe the
 When scientific measurements, such as radiocarbon dating, are taken, the flying Spaghetti transforms the demon figures so that scientists understand that the Earth is billions of years old
 pastafaari dharm kii swarg kii sankalpana main ek bear jwalamukhi or nagn nartakiyaan banane vaala kaarkaana shaamil he
 
 pastafaari nark bhi aisa hi he, par bear basi he or nartkiyon ko yon sanchaarit rog hai
 According to pastoral beliefs, pirates are in reality celestial beings and original pastoralists
 pastafaari maanate hai ki samudri luteron ke "chor or bahishkrut" hone kii dharna madhyayug main isai dharamshastriyon dwaara or aaj antarrashtriya krishnabhaavnamrita sangh dwaara failaai ja rahi juthi soochna kaa nateeja he
 According to them, in reality the pirates were "peace-loving travelers and disseminators of harmony" who distributed sweets to children
 ye kehete hai ki aaj ke samudri luteron kaa "pracheen jindadil samudri lutrron" se koi sambandh nahin he
 Additionally, Pastafari holds the ghosts of pirates responsible for the mysterious disappearance of marine and airplanes from the Bermuda Triangle
 pastafaari har varsh 19 sitambar ko "samudri luteron kii tarah bolo kaa antarrashtriya diwas" manaate hai

 saurapurana ek puraana he
 It is counted in the subpuras, it is the sixteenth subpune according to the sequence in the Sutasahita
 kisi kisi kaa mat he ki sambpurana, bhaskar, aditya, bhaanav or saurapurana ek hi granth hai, keval naam bhinn bhinn hai, parantu yah kathan galat he, kyonki devi bhagwat ne adityapurana se pruthak saura ko gina he evam sutarasanhita ne sambpurana se bhinn saurapurana gina hai, bhaskar or bhaanav ye do pathbhed bhargav or bhaanav ke sthaan main paae jate hai
 Therefore, it is wrong to call them congruent with Saurapuraan
 kadachit ye uppurana hone par bhi samprati uplabdh nahin he, evam pracheen pramanik granthon main inkaa ullekh nahin he
 Saurapuran is available from Poona's Anandashram Sanstha, possibly printed from the Dakshinatya nine copies, the text of the northern copies may vary
 is puraana main adhyay 69 tathaa shloke sankhya 3,799 he
 Saurapurana calls itself the "khil" of the Brahmanda Purana, that is, the Upupurana and considers the form of Santkumarasamhita and Saurisamhita with two distinctions
 is samay sourisamhita ko hi saurapurana kehete hai or sanatkumarasamhita ko sanatkumarpurana naam se uppuraanon main pratham ginate hai
 In the name of Saurapuran, there will be confusion about the knowledge of the Sun, but it is a Shivvicayak Uppurana, only Sun has said to the mind
 at: anya puraanon ke samaan isko saurapurana kehete hai
 This Purana Sutta is said by Vyasa in front of the Shaunakadik sages who are doing the long-term meditation in Naimisharanya
 yah uppurana hone par bhi puraana ke "sargashch pratisargashch" aadi lakshan isamen paae jate hai, 
 In this Purana, the diatomist Madhavacharya has been criticized in detail in chapters 39–40
 ve adhyay yadi prakshipt na hon to yah kah sakate hai ki is puraana kaa pranayan nae vichaar se dakshin desh main san 1200 main hua
 The description of Kali Yuga which came in the fourth chapter is also a source of this imagination
 is puraana kaa prarambh is prakaar he - suryaputra manu kamika van main yajna karanevaale pratardan raja ke yajna main gaya, vahaan tatv kaa vichaar karanevaale parantu nirnay karne main asamarth rishiyon ke saath akashwani dwaara pravrutt hokar surya ke dwadashaditya naamak sthaan main jaakar suryadarshan ke nimitt tap karne laga
 After thousands of years, the Sun appeared and narrated the Saura Purana
 isamen vishesh vishay ye hai- The characters of Sudyumna, Prahlad, Tripur, Upamanyu etc
 are worth reading

 The origin of Shiv Pujadi, Pashupat, Parvati and Tarakasuravadh etc
 have been described in an interesting manner
 shivbhakti, ujjayinisth mahakaal aadi kaa varnan, panchaksharmantramahima bhi drashtavy hai
 Theologically appropriate decisions - Tithi, Sankranti, Atonement, Umamaheshwar Vrat, Punya and Vrajyadesha, Shraddha etc
 are to be considered

 Joseph was more interested in fighting and walking with his classmates than studying in the church

 jab usee varsh lenin ko lakva maar gaya to satta ke liye trotski or stallin main sangharsh prarambh ho gaya
 After Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin revealed himself to be his disciple
 chaar varsh ke sangharsh ke pashchaat trotski ko parajeet karke vah rus kaa netaa ban baitha
 In 1928, Stalin announced the first five-year plan
 is yojana ke teen mukhya uddeshy the - samuhik krishi, baari udyogon kii sthapana or nae shramik samaaj kaa nirmaan
 The government used to buy the grain produced in the collective farms at a fixed rate and used to rent tractors
 nirdhan or madhya varg ke krishakon ne is yojana kaa samarthan kiya
 The rich peasants opposed this but they were suppressed
 1940 i
 main 86% ann samuhik kheton main, 12 % sarkari formon main or keval 1 % vyaktigat kisaanon ke kheton main utpann hone laga
 Thus in about 12 years this revolutionary change in agriculture took place in Russia
 udyogon kaa vikaas karne ke liye turkistan main bijli kaa utpaadan badhaayaa gaya
 As a result of the new revolution, in 1937 only 10% of the people remained illiterate whereas before 1917 79% were illiterate
 stallin samyavaadee netaa hi na tha, vah rashtriya taanashaah bhi tha

 The first five-year plan remained in force from 1928 to 1932, with the aim of ending the remnants of capitalism, industrializing Soviet Russia, grouping and mechanizing agriculture
 1932 i
 main duusari panchavarshiya yojana lagu hui
 In this, emphasis was laid on the production of consumer goods
 faltah roosi janata ke rahan-sahan main sudhaar hone laga
 At the same time special attention was paid to the means of transport and construction of habitat
 chunki isi samay germany main hitler kaa udai hua tathaa usne rus par akraman kii niti apanaai
 Therefore, Stalin had to concentrate on the manufacture of weapons rather than the manufacture of consumer goods
 is kaal main rus main lohe-ispaat tathaa koyale kaa utpaadan kai guna bad gaya
 He became the leading country in the manufacture of tractors, rail engines
 yahi vajah he ki naaji akraman ke dauraan rus ne uskaa safaltaapurvak saamana kiya
 Similarly, it had to be postponed as World War II started in 1938
 stallin ne sabhi nijee kaaryon visheshkar krishakon ke formon kaa purna rup se unmoolan kar sarkari farm kholane kaa aadesh jari kiya
 He nationalized agriculture and created government and collective firms in place of individual fields
 samuhik formon kii sthapana bahut se kisaanon kii jameenon ko sammilit kar ek farm banaakar kiya gaya, jisamen samast kisaan samuhik rup se kaam kar saken
 All the small and big farmers opposed this grouping, but Stalin strictly faced them
 vidrohi kulkon evam krishakon ko lakhon kii sankhya main bandi banaaya gaya tathaa hajaaron ko goli se uda diya gaya
 Stalin stressed the end of illiteracy
 usne ek baar kaha tha ki bauddhik kranti ke bina samyavaadee aarthik vyavastha kii safalataa sambhav nahin he
 The government made primary education free and compulsory

 The constitution that was created in 1918 under Lenin was revised by Stalin in 1936 and implemented as a new constitution

 It consisted of two houses whose tenure was fixed for four years
 18 varshaki aayu waalon ko matadhikaar diya gaya
 Citizens were also given the right to get work
 is prakaar stallin ne rus ko pragati ke path par agrasarit kar dwitiya vishwayuddh main naaji germany kaa muqabla karne hetu taiyaar kiya
 It is true that he implemented policies through vigorous oppression, state of terror and dictatorship
 vah nirday hokar desh ke bhitari dushmano ke samaksh pesh hua
 But it is also true that if he did not do this, the only workers' government in the world would have been destroyed by the Nazis

 Ethylene has a double bond between two carbons, in acetylene the triple bonded compounds are temporary
 ye aasaani se oxikrut evam hellojanikrut ho sakate hai
 Many derivatives of hydrocarbons can be prepared, which have diverse uses
 aise vyutpann chloride, bromide, iodide, alcohal, sodium alcoxide, amin, maracaptain, nitrate, nitrite, nitrite, hydrogen phosphate tathaa hydrogen sulphate hai
 Unsaturated hydrocarbons are more active and combine with many reactants to form a readily derived derivative
 aise anek vyutpan audyogic drushti se bade mahatv ke siddh hue hai
 Many valuable solvents, plastics, anthelmintic drugs etc
 have been obtained from them
 hydrocarbonon ke oxikaran se alcodaul ether, kitone, aldihide, vasa amla, aster aadi praapt hote hai
 Alcohol can be primary, secondary and tertiary
 inke aster drav sugandhit hote hai
 Many scented liquids can be prepared from them

 Magahi literature refers to the written literature written in Pali Magadhi, Prakrit Magadhi, Apabhransh Magadhi or modern Magahi language
 ‘sa magadhi mulbhasha’ se yah bodh hota he ki aajeevak tirthankar makali gosaal, jin mahavir or gautam buddha ke samay magadhi hi mul bhashaa thi jiskaa prachlan jan saamaanya apane dainandin jivan main karte the
 In the Mauryan period it became the language of royal rule because it is the language engraved on the inscriptions of Ashoka
 jain, buddha or sidhon ke samast pracheen granth, sahitya evam upadesh magahi main hi lipibaddh hue hai
 Linguists believe that all Aryan languages have developed from Magadhi itself
 magahi shabd kii utpatti ‘magadhi’ se maani gayi he - Adi Grammacharya Kachan has said regarding the ancientness of Magahi - ‘chulvansh’ main bhi magadhi ko sabhi bhashaaon kaa mul bhashaa kaha gaya he - Maudgalyayan, Buddhaghosh and Natyacharya Bharatamuni have also accepted Magahi as the popular language of the common man
 sanskrit naatakon main aam aam logon kii bhashaa ke rup main magahi kaa hi prayog hua he
 Western linguist and first surveyor of Indian languages, George Abraham Grierson, has accepted two forms of modern Magahi - purvi magahi jharkhand rajya ke chatra, hazaribagh ke dakshinpurv bhaag, manbhoom evam ranchi ke dakshin purv bhaag kharasaavaan tathaa dakshin main urisa ke mayurbhanj evam bamada tak boli jaati he
 The western part of Malda district of West Bengal is also the area of eastern Magahi
 shuddh magahi apane kshetra main boli jaati he
 It is spoken not only in the western region of Patna, Vrihat Gaya, Chatra, Hazaribagh, Munger, Bhagalpur and Begusarai districts, but in the south of Ranchi in the east, in the northern region of Singhbhum and in some areas of Seraikela and Kharsawan
 bhashavidon ne purvi magahi tathaa shuddh magahi ke saath hi mishrit magahi kaa ek rup bhi sweekaar kiya he
 Accordingly, the form of mixed Magahi appears where Adarsh magahi is expressed as a border dialect consisting of other sibling languages such as Maithili and Bhojpuri on its border
 aadhunik kaal main magahi bhashaa ke anek rup dikhaai padate hai
 Since the area expansion of Magahi language is very wide, due to location differences, many distinctions have also occurred in its form
 magahi bhashaa ke kshetreey bhedon kaa sanket krishnadev prasad ne is prakaar se kiya he - Linguist Bholanath Tiwari believes that the iconic form of Magahi is spoken in the old Gaya district
 grearsan ne bhi gaya jile kii magahi ko vishuddh magahi mana he
 According to Grierson's language survey, the number of 'magahi' speakers was about 6,504,817
 lekin 2001 kii janaganana ke anusaar ab magahi bhashi logon kii sankhya lagbhag 1 karod 30 lakh he
 It is used and the pure Magahi speaking population resides mainly in the areas of Patna, Gaya, Aurangabad, Rajgir, Nawada, Nalanda, Jehanabad and Arwal in the state of Bihar
 mahapandit rahul sankrutyaayan ne magahi bhashaa ke vikasaatmak itihaas ko nimna rup main prastut kiya he - Apart from Rahul ji, many other scholars of language literature have divided the period of Magahi

 shrikant shastri kaal jaise magahi sahitya kaal kii bhi pariklpana kar lee he
 Which is not only a Brahmanical and Manuwadi literary concept but also a personal glorification and unscientific one
 phir bhi ab tak hue vibhaajanon ko samekit karte hue magahi sahitya ke kaal ko nimnaankit taur par vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he - Adi Pali is primarily literature of the pre, contemporary and later times of Ashoka in the Magahi period
 ashok ke purv or parvarti kaal kaa magahi sahitya anuplabdh he parantu ashokakaleen magahi sahitya hamen shilalekhon, guhalekhon or mauryalin granthon main miltaa he
 The literature of Prakrit Magahi period is Jain and Buddhist literature
 sabhi jain aagam or buddha vachan praakrit magahi bhashaa main hi sangrahit hue hai
 According to Rahul Sankrityayan, the time of Apabhransh Magahi period is from 550 to 1200 AD
 durbhaagya se is kaal kaa magahi sahitya anuplabdh he
 The literature of the ancient Magahi period is extremely rich, beginning with the writings of the siddha poets of the eighth century
