 ’’ Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Ashok Singhal has said something in the Vishwa Hindu Congress that is going to be disputed

 Ashok Singhal said, 'after Prithviraj Chavan, the power of Delhi has come to Hindus
 ' viechpi netaa ke is bayaan ko modi sarkaar ko mili prachand bahumat se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 When Singhal made this statement, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat was also present on the stage
 gaur karne vaali baat he ki jab se bijepi centre main satta main ai he tab se hinduvadi sanghathanon dwaara is tarah kii bayaanbaji hoti rahi he
 Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat himself described India as a Hindu nation
 unke is bayaan par siyaasi bavaal khadaa ho gaya tha
 This was in December 2001, when a meeting was held in Bonn to consider the future of Afghanistan after the Taliban's annihilation
 francfort hawaii adde se laut rahe bhartiya pratinidhi mandal ke paas tej kadamon se chalata hua ek shaks pahunchaa
 It was Ashraf Ghani, an anthropologist from Afghanistan, who was sent there to assist the Special Envoy of the United Nations
 daandaataaon ke sammelan main bhale hi afghanistan ko karodon dollar ke sahyog kaa vaada kiya gaya tha, lekin gani is baat ko lekar ghabaraae hue the
 His concern was very basic
 abhi to sirf vaade kiye gaye hai, nakadi nadaarad he, jabaki afghanistan kii sankramanakalin sarkaar ko tatkaal paison kii jarurat thi
 He asked, "can India help $ 10 million initially?" Gani managed to get his point that day
 bharat ne unki baat maani or yah raashi kabul pahunch gai
 Ghani today stands at the mouth of winning the presidential election in Afghanistan
 ve das lakh voton se aage chal rahe hai
 There is controversy over this edge
 haalanki bharat chunaav ke nateezon ko lekar ab bhi ashankit he
 In the run-up to the presidential election, one thing was clear that India was playing its bets on Abdullah Abdullah, not on Ghani
 aisa nahin ki gani ke saath bhartiya madhyasthon ke sambandh achche nahin, lekin bharat ke saath abdulla ke rishte us par baari padate hai
 Abdullah's family has lived in India for years
 unke bacchon kii padhai-likhaai yaheen hui he or ahamed shah masood ke netritv vaale puraane nordarn alliance kaa ve anivaary hissaa rahe hai
 Gani, on the other hand, is a creation of the West
 unhone bayrut main american uniwarsity or colombia uniwarsity main padhai kii or baad main vishwa bank main naukari karne se pehle barkale or jon hopkins uniwarsity main padhaayaa
 He spent some time in Karnataka to oversee World Bank projects
 kaha jaataa he ki us dauraan bharat ke krishi sambandhi itihaas or bhoomi sudhaaron main unki gambhir dilchaspee thi
 He later became the Finance Minister of Afghanistan and also Chancellor of Kabul University
 abdulla kii tarah unhone bhi 2009 kaa chunaav ladaa tha or chauthe sthaan par rahe
 He recently came into the limelight as a major mediator in transitional Afghanistan, opening the way for the withdrawal of NATO forces from there
 unke sandarbh main bharat kii chintaaen dotarafa hai
 The first concern is the fragmentation of the mandate, where dangerous polarization is taking place between Pakhtun and Tajik
 yah paridrishy dharmik kattarwad or taliban samarthak takaton ke ubhaar ke liye bilkul anukool he
 Secondly, Ghani's view of Pakistan is inspired by Western liberalism
 ve maanate hai ki bharat or pakistan ko afghanistan ke hit main apane aapasi masalon ko sulajhaa lenaa chahie
 This in itself may be a good idea, but it is also a policy for Kabul to maintain equal distance from both countries
 bhartiya adhikariyon ke saath band daravaajon main hui baithkon main ve apane ye vichaar rakh chuke hai
 India fears that in the context of Pakistan, Ghani will make Afghanistan's policy more flexible so that he can get Pakistan's support to keep the Taliban under control
 taliban pakistani sangrakshan ke tale hi vahaan ab tak aatank failaa rahe hai
 In return, Pakistan would like Afghanistan to reduce its presence and influence in India
 chunki gani vaise kisi bharat virdohi maansikta se grast nahin hai, lihaaja unhen is morche par kade faisle lene honge
 In fact, outgoing President Hamid Karzai's stance with Pakistan was for some time compromised
 lekin jab unhen ehsaas hua ki afgaan niti islamabad ke haathon main nahin he to unhone apana rukh badal liya
 Recently, when Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif sought cooperation from Karzai to fight the terrorists, he shocked Pakistan by putting some conditions for cooperation
 sharten kuch is prakaar thim: sabhi aatankiyon ko bina kisi bhedbhaav ke nishaanaa banaaya jayega; afghanistan main aman ke samarthak afgani taliban netaaon ko reeha kiya jayega
 And Afghanistan and Pakistan must coordinate their counter-terrorism efforts with India and China
 gani raashtrapati chune gaye to beshak pakistan ko itane kade shabdon main likhe gaye patr kii ummid to nahin hogi
 But India has to be prepared for any such situation
 philhal sabase badi kootnithik chunauti yah he ki itani gahari siyaasi khai ko paatane ke liye prayaas kiye jaaen
 There are some questions about the electoral process, which will be addressed in the next few weeks
 lekin uske baad shanti honi chahie
 This thing will be special for Ghani because he is Pashtun himself and he has to take initiative in giving power to the Tajik
 chunki afgaan neshnal army main zyaadaatar tajik hai, lihaaja kisi tajik ko raksha mantri kaa pad dene kaa ek vikalp to banataa he
 In the opinion of experts, the good thing is that the incident at Ghani Frankfurt Airport is not forgotten yet
 bharat main watsap ke jariye afvaahon or phek news phekane ke chalate hinsa kii kai ghatnaayen saamne ain thim
 After this, Facebook-owned whatsapp started several campaigns to curb these incidents
 ab jaankaree mili he ki sarkaar loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad phek news or bhadakaau post par viraam lagane ke liye watsap ko dishanirdesh jari kar sakati he
 Under this, the government will ask the messaging app company where did such a post originate
 lekin watsap sarkaar ko ye nahin bataanaa chaahati
 The company says that doing so is a violation of the right to privacy and freedom of expression
 iconomic times kii khabar ke mutabik, watsap is sambandh main sarkaar ke prastaavit niyamon kaa virodh karegi
 Information about this move of the social media company has been received from sources
 praapt jaankaree ke mutabik sarkaar aam chunaavon ke baad soshal media companiyon ko dishanirdesh jari kar sakati he, jiske mutabik agar aisi companiyaan yaa ap ke karmchaaree ye nahin bataate ki massej kaa sorce kya he to company par jurmaana lagaaya ja saktaa he, saath hi karmchaariyon ko jail bhi bheja ja saktaa he
 It has been reported by quoting a source related to whatsapp, that whatsapp feels that the scope of the proposed rules is very large and it is also against the right of privacy
 niztaa kaa adhikaar duniyabar ke sabhi logon ke liye kaaphi ahmiyat rakhata he
 The company feels that it is very difficult to meet the demand that the government is making because the company offers end to end encryption to the users
 aise main kisi post ke sorce kii jaankaree dene ke liye company ko puri tarah se ek nae product par kaam karnaa hoga
 Another source told ET that whatsapp will continue to oppose the government in this matter, as it believes such rules would weaken the encryption feature
 company kaa maananaa he ki yugers ke personal data ko store karnaa plateform ke swabhaav se mail nahin khaataa
 whatsapp has been created so that there will be confidentiality in mutual interaction between users

 It is clear in the video that financial penalty was also imposed against the culprits
 sutron kaa kahana he ki is panchayat main nyaayadhish or police bhi samaaj ke hi log hote hai, tathaa doshi bhi samaaj ke hi log hote hai
 That is why the complaint of this court does not reach the police

 america ke purv raashtrapati baraak obama apni patni mishael se pehle kisi or mahila ko dil de baithe the or ve apane rishte ko lekar kaaphi sanjeeda the lekin unka yah pyaar paravaan nahin chadh sakaa
 This is mentioned in an upcoming biography of Obama, the Washington Post said in a review of the book that the story of a woman named Sheila Miyoshi Jagger for the first time in the book "rising Star: The Making of Barack Obama" written by David J
 Garrow
 Shared which Obama loved and lived with him in Chicago
 jaigar ne lekhak david gairo ko bataaya, ''1986 kii sardiyon main jab ham mere mata-pita ke ghar gaye to obama ne mujhase shaadi karne ke liye kaha
 According to the review, Jaeger's parents did not like the duo's companionship
 unka maananaa tha ki jaigar kii umr kam he
 She was 23 at the time and Obama was two years older than her
 unke pyaar kii pingen badhati rahi lekin jaigar ko lagane laga tha ki obama kii raajnneetik mahatvakanksha unke raste main aa rahi he
 Obama began to feel that his career was in politics and he could also become the first african-american president, and this overshadowed his relationship
 jaigar ne gairo se kaha, ''mujhe acchhee tarah yaad he ki jab yah badlaav hua or mujhe thik se yaad he ki 1987 tak jab hamaare rishte ko ek saal hua tha to unhone pehle hi raashtrapati banane par apana dhyaan laga diya tha
 Jagger said Obama had asked Jagger about his re-marriage before going to Harvard Law School
 obama chaahate the ki vah unke saath aae
 The comments harvard main ek saal padhane ke baad obama ek pratishthit sthaneey kanoon company main kaam karne ke liye chicago aae

 ve jaldi apane rishte ko lekar sanjeeda ho gaye, haalanki jab jaigar shikshan fellowship par harvard aayin tab bhi obama ko unke rishte ko lekar kuch aas thi
 "I always feel bad about it," Jaeger told Garrow

 '' samiksha ke anusaar jaigar ke mata-pita ko donon kaa saath pasand nahin tha
 He believed that Jaeger was under age
 us samay vah 23 baras kii thim or obama unase do saal bade the
 The pangs of his love continued to grow, but Jagger felt that Obama's political ambitions were coming his way
 obama ko yah lagane laga tha ki unka kariyar raajnneeti main he or vah pehle africa-america raashtrapati bhi ban sakate hai, or yah unke rishte par baari padaa
 "I remember well when this change took place and i remember well that by 1987, when our relationship had been a year, he had already focused on becoming president," Jagger told Garrow

 In Sahitya Aaj Tak, writer Ashok Vajpayee attended the 'ashoka of Sahitya' session and discussed the current state of democracy and literature
 is dauraan unhone apane jivan se jude kai kisse bhi bataae
 During the discussion, he said that the biggest threat to democracy is still
 ashok vaajapeyi ne apni pehle kitaab sangrah ko lekar bataaya, 'pehla kavita sangrah 'shahar ab bhi sambhaavna he' aane se pehle main kareeb 200 kavitaayen likh chukaa tha, lekin maine apane pehle sangrah main kareeb 150 kavitaaon khaarij kar di thi or usamen sirf 50-55 kitaaben shaamil kii gai thi

 During that time, the anchor of the channel had said that you are also a poet and then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is also a poet and why not comment on his poems
 tab maine kaha- ek vaajapeyi ko duusare vaajapeyi par raay nahin dena chahie
 But a few days later an interesting incident occurred
 darasal us dauraan maine pradhanmantri se time maanga or mujhe mil gaya
 When i went to meet, i sat there
 us dauraan vaajapeyi ji ne mujhase kaha- are bagal main aakar baithiye
 
 
 It is not forbidden for one Vajpayee to sit on another Vajpayee
 
 
 tab main chaunk gaya tha
 Regarding a statement given during the Bhopal gas tragedy, Vajpayee said, "everything became normal there three days after the Bhopal gas tragedy
 us dauraan ek patrkaar ne poocha- kya aapako lagata he ki bhopal main sab kuch saamaanya ho gaya he, tab maine kaha tha- ''haa, kisi marane vaale se saath mara nahin ja saktaa

 Then i understood that it is foolish to ask questions to such a person
 haalanki us dauraan unhone ek jawaab diya tha ki main buddha darshan kii tarah aakarshith hua, lekin use sweekaar nahin kar saktaa, kyonki wo shoonyata kaa darshan he
 Being a poet cannot accept emptiness
 kyon hai nirlajj kavi?vaajapeyi ne bataaya ki wo khud ko nirlaj prem kavi kyon kehete hai? unhone bataaya, 'ek to nirlaj hum, isliye kahata hum
 i am a little behind 80 years of my life, but i have not stopped loving or writing poems of love
 kavita prem or mrityu ke bina sarthak kavita nahin likhi ja sakati
 Probably i have written poems on death, love in my life
 unhone vishnu khare ke ek intervyuu ko lekar kaha ki main bhartiya janata party, hindutv or aresas teenon ko hindu dharm kaa sabase bada dushman maanata hum

 It has three arms of violence, injustice and hatred and their understanding of arts is very poor
 unhone kaha ki kavita kahin se paidaa nahin hoti he or kavita banani hoti he
 It is a skill to write and it has to be learned
 yah aap dusron kii kavitaaon se siikhnaa hota he
 Also, people do not study, which is very important
 vahiin unhone kaha, 'kavita kaa arth adhuraa hota he or jab aap isamen apana thodaa arth milaate hai, to yah puraa hota he

 unhone kaha he vah nitish kumaar kii iftaar party ke dauraan unase milenge or unase is mudde par baat karenge
 The comments lalu ne kaha, 'do do baithak main shariq bhi hue, main bhi gaya tha ek baithak main to main bhi gaya tha

 ab ekaek kya khichdi paki ki nitish ji kii party jediu ne naam bol diya bijepi ke ummidavaar kaa, aresas ke ummidavaar kaa naam le liya
 Surely we will talk to Nitish ji and appeal that to reconsider it, a historical mistake has been made from you
 ' On Thursday, Lalu had said, "the decision by his ally JDU to support NDA presidential candidate Ramnath Kovind is a" wrong decision "and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is making a 'historic mistake' by supporting him
 ' The RJD is in a coalition government in Bihar with Nitish Kumar's JD u and the Congress

 ' Lalu said, 'I also attended two meetings, i had also gone to one meeting and i had also gone
 maine nitish kumaar ji se poocha tha ki kya karnaa he, kya nirnay he? to nitish ji ne kaha tha ki jo sabhi log kahenge usko maananaa he, vipaksh ko ek saath chalanaa he
 Now suddenly, what did Khichdi say that Nitishji's party JDU named BJP candidate and took the name of candidate of RSS
 jarur nitish ji se baat karenge or apil karenge ki is par phir se vichaar kii, aitihaasik galati to aapse ho gai he

 ' rajd bihar main nitish kumaar ke jad you or congress ke saath gathbandhan sarkaar main shaamil he

 In the face of the ever-growing stature of the US, UK and China, what Indian athletes achieved in the shadow of Phelps and Bolt appears to be extremely modest

 An incident from the Mahabharata period is reportedly associated with this place
 mahabharat kaal main arjuna ke pautra or abhimanyu ke putr raja parakshit akhet par nikle hue the
 During this time, he saw a sage who was doing penance
 lekin rishi ke raja kaa abhivadan na karne par raja parakshit naaraaz ho gaye or rishi ke gale me sarp daal diya
 The angry sage cursed the king to die seven days later
 tamaam upaay karne ke baad bhi raja kii 7 din baad sarpdansh se maut ho gai
 Parikshit's son Janmejaya thought of taking revenge on the father's death and got the Nag Yagna performed
 aasmaan se aakar sarp agni kunda ke hawaale hone lage
 These flames caused leprosy to Janamejaya
 rishiyon-muniyon ke bataane par ve kodh ke ilaaj ke liye marwar kshetra kii aravali pahari kii taraf nikal gaye, jahaan unhen suryaast se pehle pahunchnaa tha
 By mistake they reached near the second hill
 yahaan unki ghodi revati ke biimaar ho jane se uski maut ho gai
 The village was named Revat after the name of this mare
 jahaan puure desh kii tungston kii ekmaatr khan he
 Janamejaya was to reach that hill before sunset
 yahaan se janamejay paidal gaye
 And in Tamdoli village, he sat and rested under a tree of acacia
 or thode vishram ke baad ve apni padukaayen yaheen kholkar nange paanv ravaanaa ho gaye
 The former sarpanch of the village, Bhanwar Singh, says, "the place where we still worship the name of Bawal Ka Dhani, it is believed that Janmejaya opened his footwear there
 '' tamdoli ke paas hi achchhojai gaanv kii ek aravali pahari par janamejay pahunch gaye or manyata he ki vahaan kaa pani sharir par lagane se unki kodh kii beemaari bhi thik ho gai
 This hill is still known as Kodhya Dungri
 graminon kaa maananaa he ki barsaat ke samay is pahari par bane jhrane ke tale nahaane se kai bimaariyaan thik ho jaati hai kyonki is pahari me kai tarah kii dhaatuen hai
 Ganesh Meena, the village sub-parpanch, argues that the platform, built years ago, is still not converted into a temple, "because it is believed that the completion of the construction work here will upset Bawal's rich and the village will be in the grip of epidemic
" pehle ek baar pathar dalwakar gaanv waalon ne koshish kii to puure gaanv me ghar-ghar beemaari fail gai
 Bhanwar Singh explains , "can not take stones from Revat's sugar to build pucca houses in the village
 yahaan maharaj kii ghodi revati kii mrityu hui thi
 "whenever needed in the village, people bring stones from a remote hill
" khayr jo bhi ho, aaj manokamanaayen puri hone ke baad tamdoli or aasapaas ke gaanvon kii mahilaayein badi aasthaa ke saath padukaayen chadhaati hai
 At the same time, Lakshmanpura village, located 6 km from the town of Dungarpur in the southern district of the state, has some similar Dev and Pujare
 yahaan log parya dev par aakar paanch pathar chadhaate hai
 Then they apply to fulfill their wishes
 manokamana puri hone par phir ek baar mattha techne aate hai
 People of many nearby villages including Laxmanpura have deep faith in this place
 sthaan kii pracheenta or isse judi logon kii aasthaa pradesh main hi nahin, gujarat tak pahunch gai
 The story of Parya Dev's appearance here is also quite interesting
 graminon kii baton par jaaen to takreeban 300 varsh pehle gaanv ke maanya vyakti moghji bhai apni bakaayaa rakam ke badale gud banane kaa kadaha lene ke liye thana gaanv gaye hue the
 He neither received nor paid any money there
 teen din tak bhukhe-pyaase rahete hue jab vahaan se moghji bhai paidal laut rahe the to lakshmanpura gaanv ke paas unki mrityu ho gai
 How did we get the news of death at that time? He came to a village man in a dream and said that his body was lying in Laxmanpura
 saath hi kaha ki jis jagah par meri maut hui he, agar koi vyakti vahaan aakar paanch pathar chadhayega to uski manokamana puri hogi
 The next day, when the villagers fled to Laxmanpura, Mogajibhai's body was found there
 aaj us sthaan par chota mandir bana he, jiske peeche logon ke chadaaye pattharon kaa pahaad ban gaya
 The villagers also remove them from time to time when the pile is high
 keshubhai bataate hai, ''paanch pidiyon se ham parya dev par pathar chadhaate aa rahe he
 "if young Mayank Joshi is to be believed, the youth also have a lot of association with this place
 ''sidhi-si baat he, manokamana puri hoti he to koi kyon na aayega?''idhar marwar main jodhpur-paali ke thik bich rohit police thane ke paas omaji bana bhi rojaanaa saikadon logon ko apni taraf khinch laate hai
 Here people come to offer thread and offerings on a bullet motorcycle kept under a tree
 yah sthaan itnaa prasiddh ho chukaa he ki yahaan prasad, khilone or naashte-pani kii dukaane saj gayi
 Being on the jodhpur-pali main highway makes it easy for everyone to visit
 is sthaan kii daastaan bhi dilachasp he
 According to people, Om Rana, a motorcycle rider died in an accident
 police vaale motorcycle ko paas hi ke thane le gaye
 It is said that she automatically came to the accident site during the night
 aisa kai baar hua
 Then the police and the people of the village together made the motorcycle stand under a tree, which has become the center of faith today
 yahaan par bhi pradesh ke doordaraj ke kshetra ke log aate hai
 Seeing the crowd coming here, it seems that their sorrows and pain will be gone
 yahaan ek baat jodna jaruri he ki lok manyataon par aankh mundakar bharosa na karen

 input:pti The manner in which the former Health Minister Dr
 Harsh Vardhan was suddenly removed from Health Minister from the Department of Science and Technology, Geology, many kinds of speculations are being made
 samajha ja rahaa he ki unhen dilli main bijepi kaa cheharaa banaaya jayega or chunaav main unki sevaayen lee jaaengi
 If the party wins, then he can be the candidate for CM post
 dilli main bijepi ke paas philhal koi aisa cheharaa nahin he jise vah chunaav main siem ke taur par pesh kar saken
 Not only this, who is to be made the Chief Minister after the party wins, there is also a lot of controversy about this
 doctor harshavardhan kii chhavi is mahanagar main kaaphi acchhee he or unhen janata kaa kaaphi samarthan hasil he
 In such a situation, there is a possibility that he has been deliberately given a simple ministry so that if he leaves the cabinet, the functioning of the cabinet will not be affected
 harshavardhan kaa mantralay badalane main jitani gopneeyata barti gai, use dekhakar sabhi hairaan hai
 According to an English newspaper, he did not know until Sunday night that his ministry was going to be changed

 There is anger among some BJP leaders for removing him from this post

 His work was very loose
 modi ne jis neshnal health insurance kaa vaada kiya tha, usamen koi kaam nahin hua tha
 It is also being told that the RSS was not happy with Harsh Vardhan as his communication with them was also reduced
 ab dekhnaa he ki dilli ke chunaav main harshavardhan kii kya bhoomika hoti he or agar party jitati he to kya unhen siem banaaya jayega

 However, when he called for the bill after eating, his eyes filled up
 bill par amount nahin likhaa tha balki ek tippanee likhi hui thi
