 It also attempts to explain the construction of surface relief in the form of continents, oceans and mountains, and the geographical distribution of events such as earthquakes and volcanoes
 yah siddhanth beesvin shatabdi ke pratham dashak main abhikalpit mahadwipiya visthaapan naamak sankalpana se viksit hua jab 1960 ke dashak main aise naveen saakshyon kii khoj hui jinase mahadwipon ke sthir hone kii bajaay gatisheel hone kii avadharana ko bal mila
 The most important of these evidences is the evidence related to pauperism which confirmed the Sagar Nital diffusion
 harry hes ke dwaara sagar nital prasaran kii khoj se is siddhanth kaa pratipaadan aarambh mana jaataa he or wilson, morgan, maikenzi, oliver, parker ityadi vidwaanon ne iske paksh main pramaan uplabdh karaate hue iske sanvardhan main yogadan kiya
 According to this theory, the upper layer of the earth, about 80 to 100 km thick, which is called Sthalmandal, and which includes the earth's crust and the upper part of the earth's crust, is broken into several pieces called plates
 ye platen neeche sthit asthenosphere kii ardhapighalit parat par tair raheen hai or saamanyatya lagbhag 10-40 mimi / varsh kii gati se gatisheel hai haalaanki inamen kuch kii gati 160 mimi / varsh bhi he
 The movement of these plates presents an explanation of the origin and mountain formation of the earth's present surface pattern and it has been observed that often earthquakes fall on the boundaries of these plates and volcanoes are also found along these plate boundaries

 There are many variations in the number of small plates, but their number is generally accepted more than 100

 That is, some people believed that the size of the Earth was reduced by contraction after the origin and as a result of this contraction the forces on the surface of the earth are located and the twists are located in the form of mountains

 On the contrary, some believed that the continents have moved horizontally and due to the collision, the force in the upper surface has created mountains

 Later American geographer FB Taylor spoke of a kind of flow of continents by the gravitational force of the moon in 1908–10, and also attributed it to the origin of the Tertiary era mountains
 par unki baat par kisi ne bahut dhyaan nahin diya
 Wagner, who was an archaeologist and archaeologist, proposed the idea that the distribution of climate in ancient times could be interpreted if the continents were to be considered dynamic and he proposed the theory of continental displacement in 1912 which His book, published in 1915, was published in Origins of Continents and Oceans
 wagonar ne hi sabase pehle "mahadwipiya visthaapan" shabd kaa prayog kiyawagonar ke isi siddhanth se aage chalakar plate vivartaniki kaa vikaas sambhav ho paaya haalaanki lagbhag aadhi sadi tak unke vichaaron ko bhi vidwaanon dwaara nakaara jaataa rahaa jab tak 1960 ke dashak main pramaan nahin uplabdh hue

 Due to the construction of new plate, it is also called creative edge
 sangrakshi kinaaraa vah he jiske sahare do plate ek duusare ko ragadate hue gatisheel hon, arthath na to apsaran ho rahaa ho na hi abhisaran
 Normally, rubbing each other using this edge moves in opposite directions, but it is not mandatory, if two plates move in the same direction and their motion is different, they can still form a protective edge by rubbing their edges
 inke sahare transform bhransh paae jate hai
 Since neither the plate nor the destruction is formed, they are called protective / protective edges where the status quo is preserved in the context of construction / destruction

 Leukemia is a cancer of the blood or bone marrow
 isaki visheshta rakt koshikaon, saamaanya rup se shwet rakt koshikaon, kaa asaamaanya bahujnan he
 Leukemia is a broad term that encompasses a wide range of diseases
 anya rup main, yah rudhirvigyaan sambandhi arbud ke naam se gyaat rogon ke samooh kaa bhi ek vyapak hissaa he
 Leukemia is subdivided into various large groups in clinical and pathological terms
 pratham vibhaajan ghaatak or dirghakaalik roopon ke bich main he
 Additionally, diseases are subdivided according to the type of blood cell affected
 yah vibhaajan shwetarktata ko limphoblactic yaa limphosaitic shwetarktata or miloid yaa milogens shwetarktata main vibhajit karata he: By combining these two classifications, there are four main categories: milogens shwetarktata || ghaatak milogens leukemia )||dirghakaalik milogens leukemia ) Within these main classes, there are distinctively different sub-classes
 antat:, royendaar koshika vaali leukemia or tii-cell prolimphosaitic leukemia ko aamtaur par is vargeekaran yojana ke baahar mana jaataa he
 Displacement of normal bone marrow cells by high numbers of immature white blood cells causes significant damage to the bone marrow in the process of blood clot damage from bone marrow damage
 iskaa arth he ki shwetarktata se peedit logon ko aasaani se kharonch aa sakati he, unka atyadhik rakt srav ho saktaa, yaa unhen pin chubhane se bhi rakt srav ho saktaa he
 White blood cells that fight with microbes can be suppressed or made dysfunctional
 yah marij kii pratiraksha pranali ko saadhaaran sankraman se ladane main asamarth kar saktaa he yaa sharir kii anya koshikaon par hamalaa shuru kar saktaa he
 Since leukemia does not normally allow the immune system to degrade, some of its patients often suffer infections
 yah galtundika sankraman, mukh main ghaav yaa dast hone se lekar pranaghatak nimonia or samay-samay par hone vaale sankramanon ke rup main ho saktaa he
 Finally, deficiency of red blood cells leads to anemia, which can cause difficulty breathing and achingness
 kuch rogi anya lakshanon kaa anubhav kar sakate hai
 These symptoms may include feeling sick, such as fever, chills, night sweats, and other symptoms of flu or feeling tired
 kuch rogi bade hue yakrut or pleeha ke kaaran michali yaa baaripan kaa anubhav karte hai; iske parinamswaroop vajan main anaichhik kami ho sakati he
 If the cells affected by leukemia attack the central nervous system, then neurological symptoms may occur
 shwetarktata se jude hue sabhi lakshanon kaa kaaran anya bimariyon ko bataaya ja saktaa he
 As a result, treating the symptoms of leukemia can always be treated by medical examination
 shwetarktata kaa shabdic arth 'shwet rakt' hota he, is kaaran is beemaari kaa naam isse jodakar shwetarktata diya gaya he, adhikansh rogiyon main upachaar se pehle kiye gaye jaanch main badi maatr main shwet rakt koshika paayi jaati hai
 a large number of white blood cells are clearly visible when the blood sample is viewed under a microscope
 aksar, ye atirikt shwet rakt koshikaayen aparipakv yaa dushkriyasheel hoti hai
 An excessive number of cells can also disrupt the level of other cells, causing a damaging imbalance in the blood volume
 kuch rogiyon main niyamit rudhir gananaa ke samay shwetarktata ke kuch rogiyon main shwet rakt koshika adhik maatra main dikhaai nahin detii he
 This rare condition is called Alukemia
 asthi majja main ab karkat yukt shwet rakt koshikaayen paayi jaati hai jo rakt koshikaon ke saamaanya nirmaan main baadha daalati hai
 However, leukemia affected cells are found in the marrow instead of being involved in the blood stream, where they appear in blood tests
 aleukemia ke rogi ke liye, rakt pravaah main shwet rakt koshika kii sankhyaayein saamaanya yaa kam ho sakati hai
 Alukemia can occur in any of the four major types of leukemia, and is most commonly found in leukemia, especially in hairy cells
 leukemia ke sabhi vibhinn prakaaron ke koi bhi ek bhi gyaat kaaran nahin hai
 Different leukemia may possibly have different causes
 gyaat kaarnon main prakritik or kritrim ayaanikrut vikiran, insaanon main paae jane vaale vishaanu jaise maanav sambandhi T-limphotropic vishaanu or kuch rasaianik padaarth, vishesh rup se benzene or pichley ghaatak utak-samooh ke liye alkaile samooh sambandhi chemotherapy abhikaarak shaamil hote hai
 Tobacco intake is associated with an increased risk of developing fatal myeloid leukemia in adults
 matra-bhrun sancharan ke kuch maamalon kii soochna mili he
 Leukemia, like other cancer, occurs as a result of physiological mutations of DNA that activate oncogenes or inactivate tumor suppressor genes and hinder the control of cell death, differentiation, and division
 ye parivartan swatah ho sakate hai yaa ynikaran vikiran yaa cancerajanit padaarthon ke sampark main aane se ho sakate hai or anuvanshik karkon ke dwaara sambhawatah prabhavit ho sakate hai
 Researchers' group and subject control studies have linked contact with petrochemicals such as benzene and hair dyeing to the development of some forms of leukemia
 virason ko bhi leukemia ke kuch kismon ke saath joda gaya he
 For example, some cases of ALL are related to infection caused by either the human immune deficiency virus or the human T-lymphotropic virus
 haalanki, ek report yah suzav detaa he ki kuch keetanuon ke sampark main aane se bacchon ko leukemia se kuch had tak suraksha mil sakati he
 Some people have a genetic tendency to develop leukemia
 yah pravriti paariwarik itihaason or yugma adhyayanon se prardashit hoti he
 Affected people may comprise one or more genes
 kuch maamalon main, pariwaron main anya sadasyon ke saamaan ek hi prakaar kii leukemia viksit hone kii pravriti hoti hai; anya pariwaron main, prabhavit logon main vibhinn prakaar kii leukemia yaa sambandhit rakt karkat viksit ho saktaa he
 In addition to these genetic themes, people with chromosomal abnormalities or some other genetic conditions have a greater risk of leukemia
 udhaaharan ke liye, janmajaat vikruti se prabhavit logon main ghaatak leukemia ke prakaaron ke viksit hone kaa atyadhik khatra hota he
 Fanconi anemia is at risk of fatal myeloid leukemia
 gaiyr-ynikrut vikiran se leukemia hone ke kaarnon ko sunishchit karne ke liye kai dashakon se adhyayan kiye ja chuke hai
 All data collected by the International Agency for Research on the Cancer Expert Working Group of naturally occurring and static electricity and extremely low frequency electromagnetic energy in collaboration with the production, transmission and use of electric power They did a detailed review
 They concluded that there is very limited evidence that higher Leveled ELF magnetic fields can cause childhood leukemia
 mahatvapurn ELF chumbakeey kshetron ke sampark main aane se in ucch staron vaale chumbakeey kshetron ke sampark main aane vaale bacchon main leukemia hone kaa doguna adhik khatra ho saktaa he
 However, the report also suggests that the methodological weaknesses and biases found in these studies likely pose an increased risk of exacerbation
 vayaskon main leukemia ke saath sambandh hone yaa kisi anya rup main ghaatkata hone ke koi pramaan prardashit nahin hue hai
 Since contact with such levels of elfs is relatively uncommon, the World Health Organization concludes that contact with ELF, if subsequently proven to be functional, would only account for 100 to 2400 cases worldwide annually, Will reveal 0
2 to 4
95% of the total incidence of that year
 jab tak leukemia ke kaaran kaa pataa nahin lagaaya jaataa he, is beemaari kii rokthaam karne kaa koi rasta nahin he
 Even after the causes are detected, they cannot be controlled immediately, such as naturally occurring background radiation and therefore they are not particularly helpful in prevention purposes
 leukemia ke adhikansh prakaaron kaa upachaar aushadhiy chikitsa ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Some are also treated with radiation therapy
 kuch maamalon main, asthi majja pratyaropan upyogi hota he
 Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has proven useful in the treatment of leukemia
 ALL kaa prabandhan asthi majja ke niyantran or sarvangi beemaari par dhyaan kendrit karata he
 Additionally, the treatment must prevent the cells affected by leukemia from spreading to other parts, especially the central nervous system, such as the groin eyelet
 In general, all these treatments are divided into several stages
 upachaar kaa nirnay rudhir rog visheshgy CLL upachaar ko donon charan or vyaktigat marij ke rog lakshanon par aadhaarit rakhte hai
 a large group of CLL patients have low-grade disease, which does not benefit from treatment
 CLL sambandhit jatiltaaon yaa adhik badi hui beemaari se prabhavit vyaktiyon ko aksar upachaar se laabh pahunchataa he
 In general, the treatment points are as follows: vishisht upachaar paddati CLL shaayad vartmaan upachaar dwaara laailaaj he
 Primarily chemotherapy treatment consists of chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide with combination chemotherapy as well as a corticosteroid such as prednisone or prednisolone
 ek corticosteroid ke prayog kaa atirikt laabh he kuch sambandhit swa-pratirakshit bimariyon, jaise ki immunohemolytic anemia yaa immune-mediated thrombosaitopania ko dabaanaa
pratirodhi sthitiyon main, newcliosaid aushadhiyon jaise ki fluderebin, pentostatin, yaa cladribin ekal abhikarta ke dwaara upachaar safal ho sakate hai
 Younger patients may consider genetically different or autologous bone marrow transplantation from their own body
 kai vibhinn karkat pratirodhi aushadhiyaan AML ke upachaar ke liye prabhavakaari hai
 Treatments vary according to the age of the patient and according to the particular subtypes of AML
 samgr rup se, kaaryniti asthi majja se sambandhit or sarvangi beemaari ko rokna, jabaki nihit hone par kendriya tantrika tantra kaa vishisht upachaar karnaa he
 In general, most cancer specialists rely on a combination of drugs for the initial induction phase of chemotherapy
 is tarah ke sammishran vaale chemotherapy aamtaur par asthi majja ke jamaav main jaldi kami laane kaa laabh or beemaari se pratirodh karne main kam jokhim pradaan karte hai
 The purpose of condensation and care in bone marrow is to prevent recurrence of the disease
 asthi majja main ghanibhutikaran ke upachaar ke liye aksar baar-baar chemotherapy die jane ke alawa aushadhiyon ke saath gahan chemotherapy aprihaary hoti he
 Conversely, care-related treatment consists of the dose of drugs used during the induction phase
 CML ke liye anek sambhav upachaar hai, lekin nae rogiyon ke rog lakshan dekhakar uskaa nidaan karne ke liye maanak dekhbhaal imetinib chikitsa he
 Compared to most cancer-resistant drugs, it has relatively few side effects and can be consumed orally at home
 is aushadhi se, 90% se adhik rogi is beemaari ko kam se kam paanch varshon tak niyantrit rakh paaenge, jisase ki CML ek dirghakaalik, niyantraneey sthiti ban sakegaa
 In a more aggravated and uncontrolled state, when the patient cannot tolerate imatinib, or if the patient wishes for a permanent treatment, a genetically different bone marrow transplant may be performed
 is prakriya main ucch khuraaq vaali chemotherapy or vikiran chikitsa ke saath-saath ek anukool daata se asthi majja kaa ant:shira nishek karnaa shaamil hota hai
 About 30% of the patients die in this process
 upachaar kaa nirnay is rog ke lakshan nahin paae jane vaale roendaar koshika vaali leukemia se prabhavit marijon kaa atisheeghra upachaar nahin kiya jaataa he
 Consideration of treatment is generally considered necessary if the patient has signs and symptoms of the disease such as decreased blood cell count, frequent infections, recurrent scratches, anemia, or feeling tired that disrupts the patient's daily life Be enough to do
 vishisht upachaar paddati jin marijon ko upachaar kii jarurat hoti he, unhen aamtaur par pratidin ek saptaah tak yaa to ant:shira nishek yaa twachaa main saamaanya injection ke dwaara twachaa ke bheetar cladribin yaa ant:shira nishek ke dwaara chaar saptaah tak pentostatin diya jaataa he
 In most situations, one round of treatment will provide long-term relief
 anya upachaaron main rituzimeb kaa ant:shira nishech yaa interpheran-alpha kaa swayan injection lenaa he
 In limited conditions, the patient may benefit from the operation of the spleen
 in upachaaron ko vishisht rup se pratham upachaar ke rup main nahin pradaan kiya jaataa he kyonki unki safalataa dar cladribin yaa pentostatin se kam hoti he
 Most patients in T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, which is a rare and rapidly spreading leukemia and with an average survival rate of less than a year, require immediate treatment
 tii-cell prolimphosaitic leukemia kaa upachaar karnaa kathin he or yah chemotherapy sambandhi adhikansh uplabdh aushadhiyon ke anukool nahin hota he
 Several different treatments have been attempted with limited success in some patients: purine-analogous, chlorambucil, and various types of blending chemotherapy
 Alemtuzumab, a white blood cell attacker, has been used in treatment with greater success than previous options in treatment
 kuch rogi jo safaltaapurvak is upachaar se anukulata prardashit karte hai, unka bhi anukulata ko sudrudh karne ke liye koshika nalee pratyaropan hota he
 Significant research is being done regarding the causes, diagnosis, treatment and diagnosis of leukemia
 saikadon rog-vishyak jaanch kii yojana banaai ja rahi he yaa samay-samay par kii ja rahi he
 The study will focus on effective means of treatment, better ways of treating the disease, while improving patients' lifestyles, or reducing bone marrow coagulation or taking appropriate care after treatment
 puure vishwa main san 2000 main lagbhag 256,000 bacchon or vayaskon main leukemia se peedit hue or 209,000 logon kii isse mrityu ho gai

 Jonaraj was a 15th-century Kashmiri historian and Sanskrit poet
 unhone 'dwitiya rajtarangini' naamak itihaas-granth likhaa jisamen unhone kalhan kii rajtarangini kaa san 1149 tak kaa vrittant jari rakhte hue apane samakaleen sultan zan-ul-abidin tak kaa varnan likhaa
 Budh Shah's reign lasted from 1423 to 1474, but Jonaraj could not write a full account of his reign as he died in the 35th year of his reign
 unke shishy shrivar ne vrittant aage chalaaya or unki kriti kaa naam 'tritiy rajtarangini' tha jo 1459-1486 kaal ke bare main he
 In the second Rajatarangini, Jonaraja gives an important account of the end of Hindu dynasties and the beginning of Muslim dynasties in Kashmir
 jonraj sanskrit ke vidvan, tikaakar evam itihaaskaar the
 He was a courtly priest of Sultan of Kashmir Zainul Abidin
 yadhyapi unke janm or mrityu kii nishchit tithiyaan agyaat hai, tathaapi 1389 se 1459 itho ke bich unka jivit rahanaa adhik sambhavit he
 His father's name was Nonraj and his father's Lolraj
 brahman parivaar main utpann jonraj kushagrabuddhi the or unhone sanskrit sahitya kaa pragadh adhyayan kiya tha
 As a result of the justness of Sultan Zainul Abidin, he also got ancestral property
 prasiddh 'kiratarjunium' or mahakavi mankhvirchit 'shrikanthcharitam' par lalit tikaayen likhane ke baad jonraj ne mahakavi jayanak krit aitihaasik granth 'prithvirajvijay mahakavyam' kii vidvattapurna tikaa likhi
 It is evident from his commentary on Prithvirajvijay that he had an amazing skill in writing economics, historical investment, correct interpretation and independent commentaries
 kadachit unki isi tikaa se prabhavit hokar sultanate ke nyaayalayon ke nireekshak shiryabhatta ne unhen kalhan kii rajtarangini ko purna karne kii ajna di
 Kalhan could write the history of Kashmir only till 1149-50 AD
 uske aage 1459 itho tak kaa itihaas jonraj ne likhaa jo 'dwitiya rajtarangini' ke naam se vikhyath he
 In it, Jonaraja gives a brief description of Hindu kings from Jai Singh to Ranikota in 347 verses
 isaki tulana main shahmir ke kashmir hadapney se lekar jainul aabidin ke rajyakaal ke 1459 itho tak ke itihaas kaa adhik varnan he
 According to Stein's statement, Jonaraj had considerable achievements, but accordingly lacked originality
 phir bhi jonraj ne kalhan se milti julati style main itihaas likhane main jis kaavyatmak yogyata, charitranirupan kii utkrushtataa tathaa ghatnaon ke varnan main dakshata kaa parichay diya he, vah stuty he
 In the modern historian following the scientific style, despite the proper development of the qualities like objectivity, objectivity and rationality which are considered necessary, Jonaraj has tried to give a real statement in his book
 jainul aabidin ke vishesh kripapaatr rahane ke kaaran sultan ke vyaktigat gunon ke atiranjit varnan or unki kamiyon ke bare main granthkaar kii chuppi khatkati avashya he, tathaapi samakalik hote hue unhone sikandrashah or uske hindu utpeedak mantri suhbhatta ke dharmaandh krityon kaa varnan karte samay koi sankoch nahin kiya
 His geographical description of Kashmir is correct
 unhone prayek raja ke abhishek or mrityu kii thik tithiyaan di he
 But like other Hindu historians, he also had one flaw
 unhone alag alag shaskaon ke samay kii vibhinn ghatnaon kaa koi tithikram nahin diya
 Arabic, Persian and Turkish words are also included in the language of the Second Rajatarangini
 'dwitiya rajtarangini' likhte hue hi 1459 itho main unka pranant ho gaya
 His disciple Shrivar carried forward the subject of Rajatarangini after him
 sanskrit vidya ke hraas ke dinon main jonraj dwaara arjeet kirti mahatvapurn thi
 After Kalhan, the position of Jonaraja is safe among the many historians of that tradition

 The Myanmar script or Burmese script is used to write the Burmese language

 for example, yahan kaa arth vaastavik visarg nahin he balki iske lagane kaa arth sangat maatra ko bada karnaa he
 There are several diactric marks that alter the vowel sound of a letter
 Two diacritics are used exclusively for Pali and are rarely seen elsewhere
 One or more of these accents can be added to a consonant to change its sound
 In addition, other modifying symbols are used to differentiate tone and sound, but are not considered diacritics
 There are four methods of romanization of Burmese script
 iname se do pranaliyaan lipyantaran kahi ja sakati hai tathaa anya do kaa jor uccharan par he isaliye unhen taanscripshan kah sakate hai
 Transliteration systems - see also MLC Transcription System and ALA-LC Romanization
 taanscripshan pranaliyaan hai- BGN / PCGN romanization tathaa John Okell dwaara prayukt pranali
 a detailed discussion of these systems is given in the following tables
 Syllable onsets kaa romaneekaran nimnavat kiya jaataa he- The romanization of syllable rhymes is done as follows
 is sarini main burmi varna 'k' က saanchaa:ipachar ko aadhaar ke rup main prayog kiya gaya he
 In sequences with ွ or ဝ before တ ်, န ်, ပ်, မ် or together with ံ, the vowel pronounced is: ipachar rather than the expected mold: ipachar
 This is reflected in the BGN / PCGN and Okell transcriptions, but not in the MLCTS and ALA-LC transliterations
 The independent vowel letters are transcribed the same as the vowels formed with အ, except in ALA-LC, where those formed with အ take a preposed apostrophe : The low tone and checked tone are represented as shown in the table above
 The representation of the high tone and creaky tone varies depending on the respective syllable rhyme: sometimes they are inherent in the vowel symbol used, and sometimes they are indicated by a diacritic mark
 The ALA-LC romanization indicates these two tones explicitly only in cases where diacritic marks are used; the other three romanizations indicating them regardless of how they are spelled
 Examples: Minor syllables in Burmese contain only the vowel saanchaa:ipachar in the rhyme and do not bear tone
 They are always followed by a major syllable 
 In the orthography, they are most commonly spelled as if their rhyme was saanchaa:ipachar, but are often spelled in other ways
 In the MLCTS and ALA-LC systems, minor syllables are romanized exactly as they are spelled in Burmese orthography
 In the modified BGN / PCGN system and in the Okell system, minor syllables are indicated by the letter ă regardless of the Burmese orthography
 Examples: Where two consonants appear next to each other between two vowels in a romanization, use hyphens as necessary to avoid ambiguity
 For example: In many words, a written voiceless consonant is pronounced voiced when it appears after a vowel or saanchaa:ipachar
 This is indicated in the BGN-PCGN and Okell transcriptions, but not in the MLCTS and ALA-LC transliterations
 In BGN-PCGN, the letter for the voiced consonant is used; in Okell, the letter for the voiceless consonant is used but underlined
 Examples: Hans Christian Joashim Gramm was a Danish bacteriologist

 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The sermon that Shri Krishna preached to Arjuna in the battlefield of Kuru region is known as Srimad Bhagavadgita
 yah mahabharat ke bhishmaparv kaa ang he
 The Gita has 18 chapters and 720 verses
 jaisaa gita ke shankar bhashya main kaha he- tan dharman bhagawata yathopadisht vedavyas: sarvagyobhagavan gitakhyai: saptabhi: shlokashatairu panibandh
 It is known that in the early 20th century, in front of Geeta Press Gorakhpur, there was the same text of Geeta which is available to us today
 20veen sadi ke lagbhag bhishmaparv kaa java kii bhashaa main ek anuwaad hua tha
 Many basics are also safe in it
 shripad krishna belwelkar ke anusaar java ke is pracheen sanskaran main gita ke keval saadhe ikyasi shloke mul sanskrit ke hai
 They also support the current text
 gita kii gananaa prasthaantrayee main kii jaati he, jisamen upanishad or brahmasutra bhi sanmilit hai
 Therefore, according to Indian tradition, the place of Gita is the same as that of Upanishads and Brahmasutras
 gita ke mahatmaya main upanishdon ko gau or gita ko uskaa dugdh kaha gaya he
 This means that the Gita accepts the spirituality of the Upanishads in the Sarvansh
 upanishdon kii anek vidyaayein gita main hai
 For example, Ashwattha lore in relation to the nature of the world, Avyayamusha lore in the context of eternal Ajna Brahma, Aksha Purushu vidha in the matter of Para Prakriti or Jiva, and Ksharapurushu Vidya concerning Apara Prakriti or material world
 is prakaar vedon ke brahmavaad or upanishdon ke aadhyatm, in donon kii vishisht saamagree gita main sannivisht he
 In the words of Pushpika it is called theology
 gita main 'brahmavidya' kaa aashay nivrittiparak gyanmarg se he
 It is called Sankhyamat with which the Nivitvarigi Vibhagya is associated
 lekin gita upanishdon ke mode se aage badhkar us yug kii dein he, jab ek nayaa darshan janm le rahaa tha jo grihasthon ke pravriti dharm ko nivritti maarg ke samakaksh or utana hi faldaayak maanata tha
 The same signifies the word 'yogashastra' in the Pushpika of the Gita
 yahan ‘yogashastre’ kaa abhipraay ni:andeh karmyog se hi he
 Two definitions of yoga are found in the Gita
 ek nivritti maarg kii drushti se jisamen ‘samatvam yoga uchyate’ kaha gaya he arthath gunon ke vaishamy main samyabhav rakhana hi yoga he
 This is the position of Sankhya
 yoga kii duusari paribhaasha he ‘yoga: karmsu kaushalam’ arthath karmon main lage rahane par bhi aise upaay se karm karnaa ki vah bandhan kaa kaaran na ho or karm karanevaala usee asang yaa nirlep sthiti main apane ko rakh sake jo gyanamargiyon ko milti he
 The name of this device is Buddhayog and this is the essence of the Yoga of the Gita
 gita ke duusare adhyay main jo ‘tasya pragnapratishthita’ kii dhun pai jaati he, uskaa abhipraay nirlep karm kii kshamtavali buddhi se hi he
 This was not a situation of attaining renunciation by the renunciation of karma, but a plan to elevate the pre-existing mind to a state of disinterest while performing karma
 yahi gita kaa karmyog he
 Just as in many places in the Mahabharata, so is the interpretation and appreciation of the Sankhya path of Sankhya and the path of Karma
 ek kii ninda or duusare kii prashansa gita kaa abhimath nahin, donon maarg do prakaar kii ru chi rakhanevaale manushyon ke liye hitkar ho sakate hai or hai
 Probably no other book of the world renders the scripture of Karma with this beauty, this subtlety and objectivity
 is drushti se gita adbhut maanviya shaastra he
 Its vision is not one-sided, but all-round
 gita main darshan kaa pratipaadan karte hue bhi jo sahitya kaa anand he vah isaki atirikt visheshta he
 The description of the philosophy through cultured poetry is the personal grief of the Gita, which does not remain without enchanting any heart
 isiilie iskaa naam bhagavadgita padaa, bhagavan kaa gaaya hua gyaan
 The background of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita is the war of Mahabharata
 jis prakaar ek saamaanya manushya apane jivan kii samasyaon main ulajhakar kinkartavyavimudh ho jaataa he or uske pashchaat jivan ke samarangan se palaayan karne kaa man bana letaa he usee prakaar arjuna jo mahabharat kaa mahanayake he apane saamne aane vaali samasyaon se bhaybheet hokar jivan or kshatriya dharm se niraash ho gaya he, arjuna kii tarah hi ham sabhi kabhi-kabhi anishchay kii sthiti main yaa to hataash ho jate hai or yaa phir apni samasyaon se udign hokar kartavya vimukh ho jate hai
 The sages of India, after deep thought, imbibed the knowledge they gave to the Vedas
 inhen vedon kaa antim bhaag upanishad kehalaata he
 The characteristic of human life is the intellectual power acquired by human beings, and the knowledge contained in the Upanishads is not only the highest state of human intelligence but also gives a glimpse of what man can experience beyond the limits of intellect
 gita ke 18 adhyyon main varnit vishyon kii bhi kramprapt sangati he
 The name of the first chapter is Arjunvishad Yoga
 vah gita ke upadesh kaa vilakshan naatakeey rangamanch prastut karata he jisamen shrota or vaktaa donon hi kutuhal shanti ke liye nahin varan jivan kii pragadh samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye pravrutt hote hai
 Shaurya and patience, courage and strength made Arjuna's personality with the impressive amount of these four qualities and above all these four qualities were one and forgiveness, the other is wisdom
 balpradhan kshatradharm se praapt honevaali sthiti main pahunchakar sahasaa arjuna ke chitt par ek duusare hi prakaar ke manobhaav kaa akraman hua, carpanya kaa
 a strange kind of compassion filled his mind and his faint nature vanished
 jis kartavya ke liye vah katibaddh hua tha usase vah vimukh ho gaya
 On looking from above, his arguments in favor of this situation seem to be religious, but he himself has called it Karpanya Dosh and it is believed that due to this cuteness of mind, his natal nature was hurt or destroyed
 vah nirnay nahin kar paa rahaa tha ki yuddh kare athwa vairaygy le le
 What to do, what not to do, was not understood
 is manobhaav kii charam sthiti main pahunchakar usne dhanushbaan ek ore daal diya
 Krishna saw Arjuna's condition that Arjuna's body was fine but before the start of the war, the morale of that wonderful Kshatriya was broken
 bina man ke yah sharir khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Therefore, a guru duty came in front of Krishna
 at: tark se, buddhi se, gyaan se, karm kii charchaa se, vishwa ke swabhaav se, usamen jivan kii sthiti se, donon ke niamak avyay purush ke parichay se or us sarvopari param sattavan brahm ke saakshaat darshan se arjuna ke man kaa uddhaar karnaa, yahi unka lakshya hua
 The subject of this discussion is Gita
 pehle adhyay main saamaanya reeti se bhoomika rup main arjuna ne bhagwaan se apni sthiti kah di
 The second chapter is named Sankhyayoga
 isamen jivan kii do pracheen sanmanit paramparaon kaa tarkon dwaara varnan aayaa he
 Seeing Arjuna weeping in that sorrowful condition, Krishna has brought to his attention that this type of claviness and petty infirmity of heart is not suitable for a hero like Arjun
 krishna ne arjuna kii ab tak di hui sab yuktiyon ko pragnawad kaa jhootha rup kaha
 His trick is that Pragyadarshana essentially accepts all the events and situations of the world from time, karma and nature
 jeena or maranaa, janm lenaa or badhanaa, vishyon kaa aana or janaa
 Experiences of happiness and sorrow, these occur only in the world, this was also called the ancient Acharya synonymism
 kaal kii chakragati in sab sthitiyon ko laati he or le jaati he
 After knowing this nature of life, there is no mourning again
 yahi bhagwaan kaa vyangy he ki pragna ke drushtikon ko maanate hue bhi arjuna is prakaar ke moh main kyon pad gaya he
 An essential part of the above view was the continuity of life and the impermanence of the body
 nity jeev ke liye shok karnaa utana hi vyarth he jitna anitya sharir ko bachaane kii chintaa
 Both of these are unavoidable
 janm or mrityu baari baari se hote hi hai, aisa samajhakar shok karnaa uchit nahin he
 Then another view is of apostasy
 janm se hi prakruti ne sabake liye ek dharm niyat kar diya he
 In it comes the path of life, the periphery of desires, the power of karma
 isse nikal kar nahin bhaaga ja saktaa
 Even if someone runs away, nature again pulls him
 is prakaar kaal kaa parivartan yaa pariman, jeev kii nityata or apana swadharm yaa swabhaav jin yuktiyon se bhagavan, ne arjuna ko samajhaayaa he use unhone sankhya kii buddhi kaha he
 Further, even after Arjuna did not question, he also described the wisdom of the yogamarga
 yah buddhi karm yaa pravriti maarg ke aagrah kii buddhi he isamen karm karte hue karm ke fal kii aasakti se apane ko bachaana aavashyak he
 The biggest fear for the Karmayogi is that he gets trapped in the party of desire for fruit; He should avoid it
 arjuna ko andeh hua ki kya is prakaar kii buddhi praapt karnaa sambhav he
 What would be the situation of a person if he did deeds and no fruit, it was a practical doubt
 usne poocha ki is prakaar kaa drudh pragnawala vyakti jivan kaa vyavhaar kaise karata he? aana, janaa, khaanaa, pinaa, karm karnaa, unamem lipt hokar bhi nirlep kaise rahaa ja saktaa he? krishna ne kitne hi prakaar ke bahya indriyon kii apeksha man ke sanyam kii vyakhya kii he
 Through work, anger, fear, raga, malice, the mild mind is disturbed and the senses are not in control
 indriyajay hi sabase badi aatmajay he
 Even if someone gives up subjects from outside, the inner mind does not agree
 vishyon kaa swaad jab man se jaataa he, tabhi man prafullit, shant or sukhi hota he
 Rivers come in the sea, but he does not give up his dignity
 aise hi sansar main rahete hue, uske vyavhaaron ko sweekaarte hue, anek kaamanaayon kaa pravesh man main hota rahata he
 But those who do not lose their dignity only get peace
 ise pracheen aadhyatm paribhaasha main gita main brahmisthiti kaha he
 Thus, listening to the answer of Sankhya's explanation, in the third chapter called Karmayoga, Arjuna asked a clear question to get deeper into the subject that Sankhya and Yoga do you think well in both these passages and why not say that i am in both of them Whom should i adopt? To this, Krishna replied with the same clearness that there are two loyalties or lifespans in the world - jnana yoga for the Samkhists and karmayoga for the Karmargamis
 yahan koi vyakti karm chhod hi nahin saktaa
 Nature compels a person to perform actions with the effect of all three qualities
 karm se bachnewaalon ke prati ek badi shankaa he, vah yah ki ve upar se to karm chhod baithte hai par man hi man usamen duube rahete hai
 This situation is unbearable and Krishna has called it falsehood in the Gita
 man main karmedriyon ko rokkar karm karnaa hi saral maanviya maarg he
 Krishna even said as a challenge that without karma one cannot get food to eat
 phir krishna ne karm ke vidhaan ko chakra ke rup main upasthit kiya
 Not only are the creations of different persons threaded together on the social plane, but the relationship between man on earth and God of heaven is also dependent on the action cycle
 pratyaksh he ki yahan manushya karm karte hai, krishi karte hai or daivi shaktiyaan vrishti kaa jal bhejti hai
 Both grain and purgenes arise from karma
 ek main maanviya karm, duusare main daivi karm
 Then in favor of Karma, the idea of lok Sangraha has been given, that is, without Karma, the structure of society cannot stand
 jo lok ke netaa hai, janak jaise gyani hai, ve bhi karm main pravriti rakhte hai
 Krishna himself gave his own illustration and said that i am the form of Narayana, there is no work left for me
 phir bhi tandrarahit hokar karm karata hoon or anya log mere maarg par chalate hai
 The difference is that those who are foolish do the work by indulging but the knowledgeable does the work with disrespect
 gita main yaheen ek sabhipraay shabd buddhibhed he
 That is, it is not proper to uproot the people of ordinary understanding who are engaged in karma, because they cannot become knowledgeable, and if their karma is missed, then they will go astray on both sides
 chauthe adhyay main, jiskaa naam gyaan-karm-sanyas-yoga he, yah bataaya gaya he ki gyaan praapt karke karm karte hue bhi karmsanyas kaa fal kis upaay se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In this true Karmayoga is considered to occur in the tradition of the Chakravarti kings
 mandhata, sudarshan aadi anek chakravarti raajaaon ke drushtaant die gaye hai
 This is the famous assurance of the Gita that when there is defamation of religion, then there is an incarnation of God among humans, that is, the power of God is especially tangible
 yaheen par ek vaakya vishesh dhyaan dene yogya he- kshipran hi manushe loke siddhirbhavatee karmaja 
 'karma se siddhi' - There is no more effective sutra in Gitadarshan
 kintu gitatv is sutara main itnaa sudhaar or karata he ki vah karm asang bhav se arthath falasakti se bachakar karnaa chahie
 In the fifth chapter, again she has gone somewhere in the form of tips and perseverance
 isamen karm ke saath jo man kaa sambandh he, uske sanskaar par yaa use vishuddh karne par vishesh dhyaan dilaayaa gaya he
 It has also been said that there is no difference between Sankhya and Yoga by reaching a high level
 kisi ek maarg par thik prakaar se chale to samaan fal praapt hota he
 By surrendering all the deeds of life, a person reaches the pole point of absolute peace and does not indulge in karmic water like a lotus blooming in water
 chatha adhyay aatmasanyam yoga he jiskaa vishay naam se hi prakat he
 The number of subjects is the restraint of the most senses - this is the squeeze of karma and knowledge
 sukh main or dukh main man kii samaan sthiti, ise hi yoga kehete hai
 The noun of the seventh chapter is Jnana Vigyan Yog
 ye pracheen bhartiya darshan kii do paribhaashaayen hai
 Among them, the word science was very important from the Vedic point of view
 sristi ke nanaatv kaa gyaan vigyaan he or nanaatv se ekatv kii ore pragati gyaan he
 Both these views are suitable for humans
 is prasang main vigyaan kii drushti se aparaa or para prakruti ke in do roopon kii jo sunishchit vyakhya yahan gita ne di he, vah avashya dhyaan dene yogya he
 Apara Prakriti has eight elements, Panchabhuta, Mind, Wisdom and Ego
 jis and se maanav kaa janm hota he
 These eight live in it
 kintu yah praakrit sarg he arthath yah jad he
 In this, the consciousness that comes from contact with the efforts of God is called Para Prakriti; He is a living being
 aath tatwon ke saath milakar jivan navaan tatv ho jaataa he
 In this chapter, many forms of God are mentioned, whose further expansion comes in the tenth chapter called Vibhutiog
 yaheen vishesh bhagwati drushti kaa bhi ullekh he jiskaa sutara-vasudev: sarvamiti, sab vasu yaa shariron main ek hi devtatv he, usee kii sangya vishnu he
 But in the people according to their own idi, the same deity is worshiped in many names and forms
 ve sab thik hai
 But it is good that a wise person recognizes the universe which is the highest peak of spiritual science
 aathven adhyay kii sangya akshar brahmyog he
 Akshar Vidya expanded in Upanishads
 gita main us aksharavidya kaa saar kah diya gaya he-akshar brahm paraman, arthath parabrahm kii sangya akshar he
 Spirituality is the name of the combined composition of man, that is, organism and body
 jeevasanyukt bhautik deh kii sangya kshar he or keval shaktitatv kii sangya aadhidaivak he
 The way these three powers work together in the body, the God, and the ghost are called Adhigyas
 gitakar ne do shlokon main in chah paribhaashaon kaa swaroop band diya he
 In the words of Gita, ॐ monosyllable is Brahman
 nawein adhyay ko raajaguhyayog kaha gaya he, arthath yah aadhyatm vidya vidyaraji he or yah guhya gyaan sabamein shreshth he
 The word Raja also had a meaning in mind
 atev man kii divya shaktimayon ko kis prakaar brahmamay banaaya jaay, isaki yukti hi rajvidya he
 In this area, the representation of Brahmanism is predominant, from which the creation of the expressed world is repeated
 veda kaa samast karmkand yajna, amrit, or mrityu, sant or asant, or jitne bhi devi devtaa he, sabakaa paryavsaan brahm main he
 The variety of Devpuja which is popular in the world is also right in its place, this vision of coordination was acceptable to the Bhagwat Acharyas, in fact it was their great power
 isi drushtikon kaa vichaar yaa vyakhya dasven adhyay main pai jaati he
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 iskaa saar yah he ki lok main jitne devtaa hai, sab ek hi bhagwaan, kii vibhutiyaan hai, manushya ke samast gun or avagun bhagwaan kii shakti ke hi rup hai
 Wisdom may be able to explain these liberated gods, but they are there in the world
 koi pipal ko pooj rahaa he
 Some mountain, river or sea, some fish and turtles
 yon kitne devtaa hai, iskaa koi ant nahin
 This abundance of deities is found everywhere in the history of the world
 bhagwaton ne inaki satta ko sweekaarte hue sabko vishnu kaa rup maanakar samanvay kii ek nai drushti pradaan kii
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 jo satv jeev balayukt athwa chamatkarayukt he, vah sab bhagwaan kaa rup he
 Considering this, the mind gets into an uncontrolled state
 11wein adhyay kaa naam vishvaroopadarshan yoga he
 In this, Arjuna saw the world form of God
 viraat rup kaa arth he maanviya dharaatal or paridhi ke upar jo anant vishwa kaa pranavant rachanavidhan he, uskaa saakshaat darshan
 The quadrilateral form of Vishnu is benign on the human plane
 jab arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa viraat rup dekha to uske mastak kaa visphoton hone laga
 'directo na jaane na labhe f shame' These same sentences of panic came out of his mouth and he prayed that the natural condition which God has placed for man is sufficient
 13wein adhyay main ek sidhaa vishay kshetra or kshetrajna kaa vichaar he
 This is the body area, the person who knows it is a field expert
 14wein adhyay kaa naam gunatray vibhaag yoga he
 This subject is a squeeze of all the Vedic, philosophical and mythological metaphysics — there are many interpretations of the three gunas — trios called sattva, raja, tam
 gunon kii samyavastha kaa naam pradhan yaa prakruti he
 a pathless creation is born from the contrast of qualities
 akelaa satv shant swabhaav se nirmal prakaash kii tarah sthir rahata he or akelaa tam bhi jadvat nishcesht rahata he
 But Rajoguna, who is in the middle of the two, drags them to the ground of Chesta
 gati tatv kaa naam hi rajas he
 The name of the 15th chapter is Purushottamayoga
 isamen vishwa kaa ashwatth ke rup main varnan kiya gaya he
 This ashwattha-like world is a great expansion
 desh or kaal main iskaa koi ant nahin he
 But the root or center of it, which is called the upward, is Brahm
 On the one hand, the ultimate glory, which gives rise to the cosmopolitan Ashwattha, is manifested in the form of the Sun and the Moon, on the other hand, it is in a Chaitanya center or Zoological
 Is in the body
 jaisaa gita main spasht kaha he-ahan vaishwanaro bhutva praninaan dehamashrith: 
 There is no more mystery than globalism or pranamayi consciousness
 nar yaa purush teen hai-kshar, akshar or avyay
 The name of the Panchabhutas is Kshar, the name of Prana is Akshar and the noun of Manastattva or Consciousness is indestructible
 inhen teen naron kii ekatra sthiti se maanvi chetana kaa janm hota he use hi rishiyon ne vaishwanar agni kaha he
 In the 16th chapter, the department of Dewasur property is described
 aarambh se hi rigdev main sristi kii kalpana daivi or asuri shaktiyon ke rup main kii gai he
 It is a fantasy of two forms of creation, one good and the other bad
 ek prakaash main, doosraa andhkaar main
 One nectar, the other mortal
 ek satya, doosraa anrut
 The noun of the 17th chapter is Shraddhatraya Vigyan Yoga
 iskaa sambandh sat, raj or tam, in teen gunon se hi he, arthath jisamen jis gun kaa pradurbhaav hota he, uski shraddha yaa jivan kii nishtha waisi hi ban jaati he
 Yagya, penance, charity, deeds are all conducted with three types of devotion
 yahan tak ki aahaar bhi teen prakaar kaa he
 The Gita has explained their differences and characteristics here
 18wein adhyay kii sangya mokshasanyas yoga he
 It contains a summary and epilogue of all the teachings of the Gita
 yahan pun: balpurvak maanav jivan ke liye teen gunon kaa mahatv kaha gaya he
 There is no one among the human beings of the earth and among the gods of heaven who is saved from these three qualities of nature
 manushya ko bahut dekh bhalkar chalanaa aavashyak he jisase vah apni buddhi or vritti ko buraai se bachaa sake or kya kaary he, kya acarya he, isko pahchaan sake
 The intellect which properly recognizes religion and unrighteousness, bondage and salvation, instinct and retirement, is the true wisdom and is the true achievement of man
 is prakaar bhagwaan ne jivan ke liye vyaavhaarik maarg kaa upadesh dekar ant main yah kaha he ki manushya ko chahie ki sansar ke sab vyavhaaron kaa sachai se paalan karte hue, jo akhand chaitanya tatv he, jise ishwar kehete hai, jo prayek praani ke hriddesh yaa centre main virajman he, usamen vishwaas rakhe, uskaa anubhav kare
 He is the entity's power, he is consciousness and he is the source of supreme bliss
 sanskrit sahitya kii parampara main un granthon ko bhashya, kehete hai jo duusare granthon ke arth kii vrihad vyakhya yaa tikaa prastut karte hai
 The Bhagavad Gita is also one of the three texts that had to clarify their perspective in order to establish any new philosophy or any new form of philosophy in the Indian philosophical tradition
 gita par anek achaaryon evam vidwaanon ne tikaayen kii hai
 Their short list according to sects is as follows: inke atirikt maharashtra sant gyandev yaa gyaneshwarkrut bhavarthadipika naam kii tikaa prasiddh he jo gita ke gyaan ko bhavatmak kavyastylee main prakat karti he
 In the present era, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilakkrit Geetarasya Tika, which was first introduced in 1915 with very detailed role and deliberation
 main puna se prakashit hui thi, gita sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhti he
 He has made such a diversion in bringing the original meaning of Gita to scholars, which was not possible till today after Shankaracharya
