 kerala kii bhashaa malayalam he jo dravid parivaar kii bhashaaon main ek he
 Several theories have been presented about the origin of Malayalam language
 ek mat yah he ki bhugolic kaarnon se kisi aadi dravid bhashaa se malayalam ek swatantra bhashaa ke rup main viksit hui
 The second view to the contrary is that Malayalam is a language derived from Tamil
 ye donon prabal mat hai
 All scholars believe that Malayalam originated due to linguistic changes
 tamil, sanskrit donon bhashaaon ke saath malayalam kaa gaharaa sambandh he
 The literature of Malayalam is centuries old in oral form
 parantu saahitiyik bhashaa ke rup main uskaa vikaas 13 veen shatabdi se hi hua tha
 'ramcharitam' written in this period is considered to be the original poetry of Malayalam
 prarambh main tamrapatron, pattharon, tadpatron par malayalam kii gadhy kritiyaan lipibaddh huin
 Among them, the prose language is the main subject related to the property and money donation of individuals and temples and there are instructions related to administration

 The prose of those articles is not even remotely related to today's prose

 From the ninth century, the script in which Malayalam was written was called 'vatteshuttu'

 The Malayalam script of today evolved from the script that was made later

 Although printing reached Kerala in the 16th century itself, the printing art work of Malayalam was delayed

 Malayalam is the main language of Kerala and Lakshadweep
 dravid bhashaaon main se ek malayalam he, kii utpatti ko lekar kai siddhanth prachlit hai
 The most accepted theory is that Malayalam evolved from Tamil to Malayalam as an independent language in the 9th century AD
 yah teen karod se adhik logon dwaara boli jane vaali bhashaa he or uske bolne vaale kerala ke baahar saudi arab tathaa khadi kshetra ke deshon main bhi rahete hai
 Malayalam as a literary language began to develop from the 13th century
 9 veen sadi se malayalam lekhan ke liye 'vattatouttu lipi' kaa prayog hua
 But the modern Malayalam script developed from the 'granthalapi' used in the 16th century

 Rajarajavarma is of the opinion that there are 53 smallest varnas or phonemes in Malayalam to create rhetoric
 inhen varnon ko akshar mana jaataa he
 'kerala Paniniyam' has the distinction of being the most authentic grammar book of Malayalam
 malayalam vyakaran kii rachana karne vaale anya vaiyaakaran hai - herman gundert, jorge mattan, kovunni nedungadi, sheshgiri prabhu aadi
 Rich literature, letters-magazines and extensive system of book-publication etc
 play an important role in the development and nutrition promotion of Malayalam
 kerala kii shiksha pranaaliyon tathaa saanskrithik pratishthanon kii bhoomika bhi kam mahatvapurn nahin rahi It is difficult to tell how many characters or letters are in Malayalam
 iske liye aadhunik bhashavigyaan kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he jisane akshar, varna athwa swanim ko aadhaar banaaya he
 The sound which has an independent pronunciation is called 'syllable' or 'syllable'
 arthbhed utpann kar sakanevaali sabase choti bhashik ikai ko 'varna' athwa 'swanim' kehete hai
 "nowadays the letter is used in the sense 'syllable' which is a technical term
 jab koi yah prashn karata he ki malayalam main kitne akshar hai tab prashn karta kaa taatpary angrezi kii bhanti varnon kii sankhya ko jaanane se he
 If correctly stated, the number of characters in English is 26 and the number of scripts is also 26
 malayalam main varnon or lipiyon ke bich koi sambandh nahin
 The relationship is between letters and scripts
 malayalam kii vishaal akshar sankhya ne lipi sudhaar ko kathit evam jatil banaaya
 The Malayalam letter numbers cannot be stated because they have distinctions at the phonemic level, which cannot be ruled out
 yah baat vibhinn vyakaran granth pramanit karte hai "
 According to Hermann Gundert, there are 49 characters in Malayalam, in terms of George Matan it is 48, a

 There are 53 varnas according to Rajaraja Varma and Seshagiri Prabhu

 They do not even have a place in the alphabet
 malayalam lipi maala kii saamaanya vyavastha ek akshar ek lipi kii he
 For this reason it can be said that in Malayalam, alphabet is obtained instead of alphabet
 kintu chillakshar iske udhaaharan hai
 The Malayalam scripts used in printing nowadays are the result of periodic sophistication and improvement

 The fundamental question regarding tragedy is why the hero is distressed and destroyed
 apni yatnaa or mrityu ke liye vah kis ansh main swayan jimmedaar he, yah samasya darshakon, prekshkon or aalochakon ke man main nirantar uthati he or iskaa niraakaran vibhinn prakaar se kiya gaya he
 In the ancient Greek tragedy, the hero is more and more guilty of corrupt attitudes, misleading feelings, or momentary charge

 arestu ne kathavstu, charitra, vichaar, style, sangeet, tathaa drishividhan ko tragedy ke aavashyak upkaran mana he or uskaa yah mat thode se antar ke saath aaj bhi manyata rakhata he
 The effect of the tragedy is explained by Aristotle on the basis of catharsis theory

 Therefore, the importance of certain classical rules was very low

 Apart from these two major categories, many other forms of tragedy have developed in modern times such as social tragedy, psychological tragedy etc
 tragedy kaa naveenatam rup pracheen unani tragedy se kuch bhinn hone par bhi atyant vaividhypurna or rochak he
 It is not only necessary for the tragedy that its hero dies in the end
