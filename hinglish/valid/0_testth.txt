 After repeating the experiment on more than 60 different liquids, it was ensured that all the fluids represented the Raman spectrum
 drav badalane se keval usase prakirnit spectrumi rekha kaa rang badalata he
 In the experiments so far, the effect was being confirmed by just looking
 kintu raman jaanate the ki jab tak raman-rekhaon kii tarangadairdhyon or unki aapekshik tivrata kaa maapan nahin kiya jayega tab tak na to prabhaav kii santoshjanak vyakhya kii ja sakegi or na hi vaigyanik jagat main manyata praapt hogi
 For this he used a quartz spectrograph, the quantitative results of which were published in the Indian Journal of Physics on March 31, 1928
 yah ek adbhut prabhaav he, isaki khoj ke ek dashak baad hi 2000 rasinic yogicon kii aantarik sanrachana nishchit kii gai thi
 After this, the internal structure of the crystal was also explored

 His early work was related to the exploration of science associated with the working of musical instruments
 raman kaa vigyaan ke prati samarpan itnaa teevr tha ki 1917 main jab unhen kalakatta vishvavidhyalay main bhautikee ke palit professor banaae jane kaa prastaav mila to apni sarkari naukari chhodkar lagbhag aadhi tankhaah par unhone is pad ko sweekaar kar liya
 Raman's entire education took place in India and till now his contact with other scientists of the world was through books and articles printed in international research papers

 This interpretation was not acceptable to Raman
 unako lagata tha ki jo siddhant vaayu ke nile rang ke liye uttaradaayi tha vahi jal ke nile rang ke liye bhi hona chahie, isliye, apni vaapasi yatra main unhone ek jebi spectrummapi apane saath rakhaa
 Ss During the voyage on a vessel called Narkunda, he carried out some experiments of scattering from glaciers and water with the help of this device

 An effective tool for physicists Early Raman effect was used in research studies by physicists
 pehle 7 varshon main is prabhaav ko aadhaar bana kar 700 se adhik vaigyanik shodh patr prastut kiye gaye
 On the one hand, in terms of theoretical physics, this effect provided a strong basis for quantum physics, while on the other hand it gave experimental physicists a highly efficient, simple technique for studying the structures of crystals and molecules
 phir dhire-dhire bhautikavidon kii is nai takanic main ruchi kam hone lagi
 But by then this technique was becoming popular among chemists as an analytical tool
 rasayanagyon ke aujaar ke rup main prayek padaarth kaa apana vishisht spectrum hota he
 Therefore, mixtures could also be chemically analyzed without destroying the substance and the material could be organic or inorganic by its signature in the Raman spectrum

 But the Raman effect again became popular among scientific inventors from the 1960s after the discovery of laser
 raman prabhaav ke sansuchan main sabase kathin samasya yah thi ki raman rekhaaen bahut ksheen hoti thim isliye unke sansuchan ke liye atyant teevr prakaash strot kii aavashyaktaa thi
 The laser not only provided such a very intense light source, but introduced new effects in the scattering light that added new dimensions to Raman spectrometry

 At the beginning of the movie, Reed Richards and Victor are friends with the College of Destruction, an experiment they use for a comet that passes through the earth, but that experiment does not take place properly, causing Victor a shock
 And when he is taken to the hospital, where the doctors declare him dead
 iske baad seen badalata hai or hamen dikhaaya jaataa hai kii su or johny storm do bachche jo apni maa ke saath rahete hai or unka ghar read ke ghar ke bagal main hai
 Now ten years later, Reid, Soo, Johnny, and Ben, Reid's friend) go to a comet passing through Earth in an experimental spacecraft, and in doing so they fall prey to cosmic rays
 lekin read ab bhi-bhi read victor ke liye, is mishan ko puraa karata he
 Now as their spaceship begins to fall down and when the spacecraft accidentally lands on Earth, the four find that cosmic rays have given them special powers, such as: Reed's body structure has become elastic ; Soo can be invisible; Johnny can generate fire; And Ben is transformed into a creature with stone skin
 phir uske baad fan par victor ke aadmi hamalaa kar detaa hai or vahi par ve khalanaayak shaasha dow0 vinaash se milte hai
 Now they escape the men of destruction and the four meet again at the Baxter Building, where they talk about using their superpowers

 Now the scene is changed and shows us a jeweler he gives a diamond to a blind artist, Alicia Masters, and the blind artist kidnaps the homeless people
 On the other side, Destruction and his henchmen find the jeweler and then they go to him
 
 vinaash kaa gurgey pehle to uske saath samjhauta karne kii koshish karata hai, par isse koi phayda naa lagane par, vinaash naakhush ho jaataa hai or hira ko jabt kar letaa hai or use elicia ko maarane kii dhamkee dete hai or isi ke saath ben us kamare main pravesh karata he or vinaash ko peeche dhakelta hua, baahar chalaa jaataa he or waapas se 'praani' main badal jaataa hai
 Now there is destruction and firing between the jeweler's men
 ab vinaash heere ko ek lager top main laga detaa hai
 Ben, on the other hand, returns to his friends and Reid discovers that the destruction is actually Victor and that only he can stop it
 iske baad ve veshbhusha karte hai or vinaash ke mahal main jate hai or vahaan par shandaar chaar vinaash kii sena ke saath yuddh karte he or unhen haraa dete hai
 Then Reid finally fights and in the meantime, Destruction commits suicide, but even then, his gloves start running on the balcony

 Bahadur Shah Zafar was the last emperor of the Mughal Empire in India and a noted poet of Urdu
 unhone 1857 kaa pratham bhartiya swatantraaa sangram main bhartiya sipaahiyon kaa netritv kiya
 After the defeat in the war, the British sent him to Burma where he died
 jafar kaa janm 24 aktubar, 1775 main hua tha
 His father was Akbar Shah II and mother Lalbai
 apane pita kii mrityu ke baad jafar ko 18 sitambar, 1837 main mughal badshaah banaaya gaya
 It was a matter of fact that by that time the Sultanate of Delhi had become very weak and the Mughal emperor had remained a nominal emperor
 bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane kii jafar ko baari keemat bhi chukaani padi thi
 His sons and great-grandchildren were publicly roasted by the British authorities
 yahi nahin, unhen bandi banaakar rangoon le jaaya gaya, jahaan unhone saat november, 1862 main ek bandi ke rup main dam todaa
 He was buried near the Shvedagon Pagoda in Rangoon
 unke dafan sthal ko ab bahadur shah jafar dargah ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Even today, when a patriotic person travels to the then Burma, he does not forget to pay tribute to Zafar's tomb
 logon ke dil main unke liye kitna sammaan tha uskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki hindustan main jahaan kai jagah sadakon kaa naam unke naam par rakhaa gaya he, vahiin pakistan ke lahore shahar main bhi unke naam par ek sadak kaa naam rakhaa gaya he
 Victoria Park in Old Dhaka city of Bangladesh has been renamed Bahadur Shah Zafar Park
 1857 main jab hindustan kii aazaadee kii chingaari bhadki to sabhi vidrohi sainikon or raja-maharaajaaon ne unhen hindustan kaa samraat mana or unke netritv main angrejon kii eent se eent baja di
 Bahadur Shah Zafar also got angry after seeing the rebellion of Indian soldiers against the British and called for the British to be driven out of India
 bharatiyon ne dilli or desh ke anya hisson main angrejon ko kadi shikast di
 Initial results favored the Indian warriors, but later, due to the deception of the British, the stand of the first freedom struggle changed and the British managed to suppress the rebellion
 bahadur shah jafar ne humayun ke makbare main sharan lee, lekin major hads ne unhen unke bete mirza mughal or khijar sultan va pote abu bakar ke saath pakad liya
 The British crossed all limits of oppression
 jab bahadur shah jafar ko bhukh lagi to angrej unke saamne thali main paroskar unke beton ke sir le aae
 He replied to the British that the sons of India sacrifice their heads for the country and come to their father in the same manner
 aazaadee ke liye hui baghawat ko puri tarah khatm karne ke makasad se angrejon ne antim mughal badshaah ko desh se nirvasit kar rangoon bhej diya
 Bahadur Shah Zafar was not only a patriotic Mughal emperor but also a famous Urdu poet
 unhone bahut si mashhoor urdu kavitaayen likhin, jinamein se kaaphi angrejon ke khilaaf baghawat ke samay machi uthal-puthal ke dauraan kho gai yaa nasht ho gai
 The lines written by him in Urdu are also very famous - ,,, Ek aisa ghar chahiye mujh Ko jiski faza mastana Ho Ek kone mein ghazal ki mahfil Ek kone mein maykhana Ho
 ,,, desh se baahar rangoon main bhi unki urdu kavitaaon kaa jalawaa jari rahaa
 He was always worried about India there
 unki antim ichha thi ki vah apane jivan kii antim saans hindustan main hi len or vahiin unhen dafnaaya jaae lekin aisa nahin ho paaya
 i do not think that my desolation is in love, what is made of alam-e-naapidar bulbul ko bagbaan se na saiyaad se gilaa,kismat main kaid likhi thi fasal-e-bahaar main
 Tell them to settle somewhere else from these haunts, where is this place in dil-e-daagdar
 ek shaakh gul pe baith ke bulbul he shaadamaan,kaante bicha die hai dil-e-laal-e-zaar main
 Age-a-drawer had brought four days of demand, two were cut in the beginning, two were waiting
 din zindagi khatm hue shaam ho gai,failaa ke paanv soyenge kunj-e-mazaar main
 How much is it for unfortunate 'zafar' dafn, two gaz zameen not found in ku-e-yaar bahadur shah jafar jaise kam hi shaasha hote hai jo apane desh ko mahabuuba kii tarah mohabbat karte hai or ku-e-yaar main jagah na mil paane kii kasak ke saath pardes main dam tod dete hai
 This was the basic difference with the fundamental Indian ideology which considers its country as its mother
 badshaah jafar ne jab rangoon main karawas ke dauraan apni aakhri saans lee to shaayad unke labon par apni hi mashhoor ghazal kaa yah sher jarur rahaa hoga- "kitna he badanaseeb jafar dafn ke liye, do gaj jameen bhi na mili ku-e-yaar main
 " bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane vaale antim mughal badshaah bahadur shah jafar urdu ke ek bade shaayar ke rup main bhi vikhyath hai
 His poetry was filled with patriotism rather than sentimental poets and this was the reason that he warned the British rulers to walk to Shamsheer of Hindustan till the planks-london
 janashrutiyon ke anusaar pratham swatantraaa sangram ke baad jab badshaah jafar ko giraftaar kiya gaya to urdu jaanane vaale ek angrej sainya adhikari ne un par kataaksh karte hue yah sher kaha- "dam main dam nahin, ab khayr maango jaan kii e jafar ab myaan ho chuki he, shamsheer hindustan kii

!!" is par jafar ne karaara jawaab dete hue kaha tha- "hindio main bu rahegi jab talak imaan kii, takhte landan tak chalegi teg hindustan kii

!!" Zafar, called the last emperor of the Mughal period in India, was made the emperor of Delhi during the First War of Independence
 badshaah banate hi unhone jo chand aadesh die, unamem se ek tha gohatya par roak lagaana
 This order shows how big he was for hindu-muslim unity
 gorakhpur vishvavidhyalay main itihaas ke purv praadhyaapak dow shailanath chaturvedi ke anusaar 1857 ke samay bahadur shah jafar ek aisi badi hasti the, jinka badshaah ke taur par hi nahin ek dharmanirpeksh vyakti ke rup main bhi sabhi sammaan karte the
 That is why it was very natural that the soldiers who reached Delhi after revolting from Meerut made Bahadur Shah Zafar their king first
 chaturvedi ne baatcheet main kaha ki jafar ko badshaah bananaa sankethik rup se british shaskaon ko ek sandesh tha
 Under this, the Indian soldiers wanted to give the message that the Indian ruler would be in power at the center of India, not foreign
 badshaah banane ke baad bahadur shah jafar ne gohatya par pabandi kaa jo aadesh diya tha vah koi nayaa aadesh nahin tha
 Rather, Akbar had given similar orders during his reign
 jafar ne mahaj is aadesh kaa paalan phir se karwaanaa shuru kar diya tha
 Another aspect of Zafar's personality was poetry, along with Deshprem
 unhone na keval gaalib, daag, momin or jock jaise urdu ke bade shaayaron ko tamaam tarah se protsaahan diya, balki vah swayan ek achche shaayar the
 According to literary critics, during the time of Zafar, where Mughal power was in decline, Urdu literature especially Urdu poetry was at its height
 jafar kii maut ke baad unki shaayari "kulliyaat e jafar" ke naam se sankalit kii gayi
 Accession of Bahadur Shah II captain hodsan dwaara bandi banaaye gayi bahadur shah dwitiya First War of Indian Independence mukhyamantri bharat main rajyon kaa rajnatik pramukh hota he

 ooshmaagatiki ke adhyayan main ek nai bhaavana kaa samavesh hota he, vah taap kii bhaavana he
 If the properties of a body do not depend on how hot or cold it is, it is necessary to know its volume or its density to get a complete introduction
 jaise yadi ham koi drav len to yantriki main yah mana jaataa he ki uske upar daab badhaane par uskaa aaytan kam hoga
 As soon as the pressure is determined, the value of the volume also becomes fixed
 is tarah in do char raashiyon main se ek swatantra hoti he or duusari ashrith athwa paranthatra
 But from direct experience we know that pressure can be changed by heating or cooling even if the volume is constant
 is prakaar daab tathaa aaytan donon hi swatantra char rashiyaan hai
 We will also include other variables as needed later
 or aage badhane ke pehle ham aisi deevaaron kii kalpana karenge jo vibhinn dravon ko ek duusare se alag karti hai
 These walls will be so subtle that apart from ensuring the mutual interaction of these fluids, they will have no effect on the properties of those fluids
 drav in deevaaron ke ek ore se duusari ore na ja sakegaa
 We would also imagine that these walls are of two types
 ek aisi deevaaren jinase aavruth drav main bina un deevaaron athwa unke kisi bhaag ko hataae ham koi parivartan nahin kar sakate or un dravon main ham vidyutiya yaa chumbakeey balon dwaara parivartan kar sakate hai kyonki ye bal dur se bhi apana prabhaav daal sakate hai
 We would call such walls "stagnant" walls
 duusare prakaar kii deevaaron ko ham "ushmagamya" deevaaren kahenge
 These walls will be such that the pressure and volume values of the liquids separated by them in equilibrium will not be arbitrary, that is, if the pressure and volume of one fluid and the pressure of the other fluid are determined, then the volume of the other fluid will also be determined
 
 aisi avasthaa main pehle drav kii daab evam aaytan P1 or V1 tathaa duusare drav kii daab evam aaytan P2 or V2 main ek sambandh hoga jise ham nimnaankit sameekaran dwaara prakat kar sakate hai : This equation represents the thermal relationship of those fluids
 diwaar kaa upyog keval itnaa he ki padaarth ek ore se duusari ore nahin ja saktaa
 Through experience we also know that if there is a thermal equilibrium of other liquids with one fluid, then these liquids themselves will have thermal equilibrium among themselves
 isi ko ushmagatiki kaa shoonyavaan siddhant kehete hai
 If the pressure and volume of the three liquids with thermal equilibrium are, respectively, and then the following equations will be like the equation: parantu ushmagatiki ke shoonyaven siddhant ke anusaar in samikarnon in samikarnon main keval do hi swatantra hai, arthath pehle donon samikarnon kii tushti ke falswaroop tisare kii tushti bhi avashyambhavi he
 This is possible only when the form of these equations is as follows: inamen se kisi ek drav kaa upyog tapamapi ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he or us drav ke falan ke maan ko ham praayogic taap kii bhanti prayukt kar sakate hai
 If the first fluid is considered to be a thermometer and its function is t, then the equation we get for the second fluid ie f2 = t is called decimation of the second fluid
 yon to drav ke kisi bhi gun kaa upyog tapamapi ke liye kiya ja saktaa he parantu p tathaa v ke jis sambandh kaa upyog kiya jaae vah jitna hi saral hoga utana hi taap naapane main sugamawa hogi
 We know that in isothermal state, the pressure and volume of a gas of low pressure is a constant
 atev pv = R0 ko taap naapane ke liye upyog main laayaa ja saktaa he or is sambandh kaa upyog kiya bhi jaataa he
 But if it is constant then the square root or square root of it will also be constant
 kintu inkaa upyog nahin kiya jaataa
 What is the advantage in using pv = R0 will be revealed later

 : First show that this statement is true for n = 0
 p kaa matlab nimnlikhit kathan hoga- Clearly this statement is true because both its right side and left side are zero, so the statement for n = 0 is true
 ) : Now show that if p is accepted as true, then we can prove that p is also true
 ise nimna prakaar se dikhaa sakate hai- agreed, arthath p satya he
 Write the left side as follows: ab, bijganit ke anusaar : This showed that indeed p is also true

 Key Mention: Kurukshetra War kurukshetra kaa ilaaka bharat main aaryon ke aarambhik daur main basane kaa kshetra rahaa he or yah mahabharat kii puranic kathaon se judaa he
 It is described in the first verse of the Bhagavad Gita
 isliye is kshetra ko dharm kshetra kaha gaya he
 Thanesar city was the capital of King Harsha, it was destroyed by Mahmud Ghaznavi in 1011 AD
 aarmabhik rup main kurukshetra brahma kii yagyiya vedi kaha jaataa tha, aage chalakar ise samantapanchak kaha gaya, jabaki parashuram ne apane pita kii hatya ke pratishodh main kshatriyon ke rakt se paanch kund bana daale, jo pitaron ke aashirvachanon se kaalaantar main paanch pavitra jalaashyon main parivartit ho gayi
 Later this land became known as Kurukshetra when King Kuru, son of Samvara, plowed the land of seven Kos with a gold plow

 isse prakat hota he ki khandav, turghn evam pareen kurukshetra ke seemaa-bhaag the or maru janapad kurukshetra se kuch dur tha
 The तrāसूasutras of Avashvālāyaयनa, Lātayāya्याa and Katyāya अनुसरणa follow the Tāndya Brahmins and other Brahmins and describe many such pilgrimages where the Sarasvatha Sessions were performed, such as Plaksha Prastravarna, the vaitandhava-hrad of Saraswati; The site of Paarin in Kurukshetra, the Yamuna flowing in the Karpchav country and the country of Triplakshaharan
 yah gyatavya he ki yadhyapi vanaparv ne 83wein adhyay main saraswati tat par evam kurukshetra main katipay tirthon kaa ullekh kiya he, kintu brahmanon evam shrautasutron main ullikhit tirthon se unka mail nahin khaataa, keval 'vinshan' evam 'sarak' ke vishay main aisa nahin kaha ja saktaa
 From this it appears that the mention of Vanaparva related to Saraswati and Kurukshetra is from several centuries after the mention of Shrutasutras

 Therefore, the history of Indian telecommunications can be traced back to the introduction of the telegraph
 bharat main dak or doorsanchaar kshetron main ek dhimi or asahaj shuruyaat hui thi
 In 1850, the first experimental electric wire line was started between Diamond Harbor and Kolkata
 1851 main, ise british east india company ke liye kholaa gaya tha
 The Department of Posts and Telegraph was at that time in a small corner of the Public Works Department
 uttar main kolkata or peshawar ko agra sahit or mumbai ko sindwa ghats ke jariye dakshin main chennai, yahaan tak ki ootkamand or bangalore ke saath jodne vaali 4000 mile kii telegraph linon kaa nirmaan november 1853 main shuru kiya gaya

 1880 main, do telephone companiyon da oriental telephone company limited or anglo indian telephone company limited ne bharat main telephone exange kii sthapana karne ke liye bharat sarkaar se sampark kiya
 This permission was denied on the grounds that it was the government's monopoly to set up the telephone and the government itself would start this work
 1881 main, sarkaar ne apane pehle ke faisle ke khilaaf england kii oriental telephone company limited ko kolkata, mumbai, chennai or ahmedabad main telephone exange kholane ke liye ek license diya, jisase 1881 main desh main pehali aupchaarik telephone seva kii sthapana hui

 The number of telephones increased leisurely to 980,000 in 1971, 2

 In the 1990s, the telecom sector was opened to private investment by the government under the liberalization-privatization-globalization policy
 isliye, sarkaar kii niti shakha ko uski karypalika shakha se alag karnaa jaruri ho gaya tha
 On 1 October 2000, the Government of India subordinated the operating portion of the Department of Telecommunications to the Corporation and named it Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited
 kai nijee operataron, jaise ki reliance communications, tata indicom, hach, loop mobile, airtel, idia aadi ne ucch sambhaavna vaale bhartiya doorsanchaar bazaar main safaltaapurvak pravesh kiya
 The Government of India was formed by several factions whose ideologies differed
 unamem se kuch videshi khilaadiyon ke liye bazaar khulaa rakhana chaahate the, jabaki anya chaahate the ki sarkaar buniyadi dhaanche ko viniyamit kare or videshi khilaadiyon kii bhagidaari ko simit rakhe
 is raajnneetik prishthbhumi ke kaaran doorsanchaar main udaarikaran laana bahut mushkil tha
 When a bill was passed in Parliament, it should have got a majority vote, but it was difficult to get such a majority given the number of parties with different ideologies
 udaarikaran 1981 main shuru hua jab pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne har saal 5,000,000 line lagaaye jane ke prayaas ke tahat france kii alcatel siaiti ke saath rajya sanchalit doorsanchaar company ke vilay ke anubandh par hastakshar kiya
 But this policy soon had to be abandoned due to political opposition

 There were many technological developments during this period, yet foreign players were not allowed to participate in the telecom trade

 It was during this period that in 1994 the government under the leadership of PN Rao implemented the National Telecom Policy, which brought changes in the following areas: ownership, service and regulation of telecommunications infrastructure

 Foreign companies were entitled to hold 49% of the total stake

 During this period, the World Bank and ITU had advised the Indian government to liberalize long-distance services to end the monopoly of the state-owned Department of Telecommunications and VSNL and increase competition in the long-distance carrier business thereby reducing tariffs
 It will help in improving the economy of the country
 The government run by Rao liberalized local services by taking the opposite political parties into confidence and after 5 years gave confidence to give foreign participation in long distance business
 The country was divided into 20 telecom circles for basic telephony and 18 circles for mobile services
 in parimandalon ko prayek parimandal main rajasav ke mulya ke aadhaar par e, bi or si shrenee main vibhajit kiya gaya
 The government kept open the tenders for one private company per circle along with state-owned Telecom Department per circle
 cellular seva ke liye prati parimandal main do seva pradaataaon ko anumati di jaati thi or har pradaata ko 15 saal kaa license diya jaataa tha
 During these reforms, the government faced protests from ITI, Department of Telecommunications, MTNL, VSNL and other labor unions, but managed to overcome these hurdles
 1995 ke baad sarkaar ne tri banaaya, jisane prashulk tay karne or nitiyon ko banane main sarkari hastkshep ko kam kar diya
 The Department of Telecommunications opposed it

 Domestic trade groups wanted the government to privatize VSNL
 aakhir main april 2002 main ant main, sarkaar ne viesanel main apni hissedari ko 53% se ghataakar 26% kar di or ise nijee udhyamon ko bikri ke liye aamantrit karne kaa faisla kiya
 In the end, Tata took a 25% stake in VSNL
 yah kai videshi niveshkon ke liye bhartiya doorsanchaar bazaar main shaamil hone ke liye ek pravesh dwaar jaisaa tha
 After March 2000, the government became more liberal in formulating policies and issuing licenses to private operators
 sarkaar ne aage cellular seva pradaataaon ke liye license shulk kam kar diya or videshi companiyon kii sweekaarya hissedari ko badhaakar 74% kar diya
 Because of all these factors, in the end the service charges were reduced and the cost of calls came down drastically, making it easier for every common middle class family in India to get a cell phone

 sarkaar ne rajya ki unnati kii liye, loktantr kii liye or mahilaon kaa sthiti ko sudhaarney kii liye mahilaon ko shiksha dena zaruri samajha tha

 vastav main kaha jaataa he ki mahilaon kii shiksha, kisi bhi purush kii shiksha se kam mahatvapurn nahin he
 Women's education is a hundred times more useful than men in creating a new framework of society
 isliye stri shiksha ke liye sarkaar ko prayasarat hona chahie
 Only then incidents like atrocities can be controlled
 shiksha praapt karke aarthik rup se aatmanirbhar hone kaa arth yah nahin he ki nari shikshit hokar purush ko apana pratidwandvi maanate hue uske saamne hi morcha lekar khadi ho jaae
 Rather, he was also able to review the friendly relations with the man by acquiring the right of equal equality with the male in the economic field
 jis prakaar sharir ko bhojan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, usee prakaar maansik vikaas ke liye shiksha aavashyak he

 samajashaastra main, saamaajik tathy un mulyon, saanskrithik maanakon, tathaa saamaajik sanrachanaon ko kehete hai jo vyakti ko parivartit karte hai or uske upar saamaajik bandhan adhyaropit karte hai
 Imail Durkim wrote the following four major books: in uparalikhit pustakon main durkhim ne vyavasthit tareeke se apane vichaaron ko pratipaadit kiya he
 The concept of social fact propounded by Durkheim is elaborated in his book 'rules of Sociological Methods'
 durkhim ke saamaajik tathy kaa vichaar herbat spencer ke vyaktivaadee vichaaron se bilkul bhinn hai
 He was of the opinion that whatever social actions are there, it should be analyzed only under social context, that is, the basis of understanding social actions is society
 isliye vyakti yaa manovigyaan ko aadhaar maanakar jo samajashaastra adhyayan kiye jate he, use ve sadaa avaigyanik maanate hai
 Giving the definition of sociology, he described sociology as "the study of social facts"
 ’’ unka yah kahana tha ki jis prakaar sabhi vishay apane-apane adhyayan vishay kaa chayan karte hai, usee prakaar samajashastriyon ko bhi saamaajik tathy kaa adhyayan vishesh rup se karnaa padataa he
 Durkheim has analyzed social fact in detail
 unka kahana tha ki saamaajik tathy hi samajashastreey adhyayan kaa pramukh adhyayan kshetra he
 They consider social fact to be a fact that is objective, and we can observe it as everything
 isliye saamaajik tathy ko ek vastu, ek cheez, ek bhautik padaarth ke rup main dekha he or jis prakaar ek bhautik padaarth kaa adhyayan bhautikee main kiya jaataa he, usee prakaar kaa adhyayan samajashaastra saamaajik tathy kaa adhyayan karte hai
 Based on the analysis of social facts by Durkheim, the following characteristics of 'social facts' are mentioned: durkhim ne ‘soshal factos’ main saamaajik tatv kii visheshtaon kaa ullekh karte hue yah bataaya kii saamaajik tathy manushya ke baahar rahata he manushya ke baahar rahete hue bhi yah uske vichaaron ko prabhavit karata he
 Since social fact remains outside human beings, it becomes easy to understand
 yadhyapi saamaajik tathy manushya ke baahar rahata he parantu yah vyakti ko prabhavit karata he
 Everyone can feel its influence and importance within themselves
 udhaahranswaroop samaaj ke jo anumodan hai, uskaa manushya ke upar uske vyavhaar ko niyantrit karne main ek prakaar kaa dabaav hota he
 Due to which the person controls his behavior
 saamaajik tathyon kaa swaroop saarvbhaumik hota he, arthath yah sabhi vyakti ke chetan avasthaa ko samaan rup se prabhavit karata he
 In this form, it can be said that social facts affect all individuals in society, so it continues to exert its influence equally in the collective life of man
 udhaaharan ke liye yah kaha ja saktaa he ki jab ham dharm kii baat karte hai tab yah sweekaar karte hai ki dharmik vishwaas tathaa uske anuroop upasna karnaa sabhi vyakti ke samuhik jivan kaa ek ang hota he
 That is to say, there are two forms of facts - one form is that which is confined to the individual and the other is its social form which also affects the way of working, the method of thinking individually
 
 iske saath tathy kaa ek doosraa saamaajik swaroop bhi hota he, jiske kaaran vyakti ke bajaay puraa saamaaj usase prabhavit rahata he
 As far as the concept of social fact given by Durkheim is concerned, Durkheim has described in detail the social form of social fact
 unhone aatmahatya ke vivechan main is baat kaa vistaar se varnan kiya he ki aatmahatya yadhyapi ek vyakti ke vyaktigat soch se judi hoti he, parantu jab yah vyaktigat sonch saamaajik soch kaa rup le leti he, tab iskaa ek samuhik swaroop bhi ho jaataa he jiske kaaran samaaj bhi prabhavit hota he
 He therefore emphasized the study of suicide as a sociological fact
 jab saamaajik tathy ko vastunishth kaha jaataa he to isse abhipraay yah hota he ki kaise is tathy kaa adhyayan bina kisi purvaagrah ke kiya ja sake
 In a study of suicide, they found that some psychological analysis had already been presented about suicide
 unki yah manyata thi ki aatmahatya kaa vishleshan na to jaivikeey aadhaar par kiya janaa chahie or na hi manovaigyanik aadhaar par
 He refuted both of these theories by suggesting that a sociological study of suicide incidents should be undertaken, and therefore he proposed a sociological analysis of suicide under a new approach, criticizing predetermined approaches
 unhone paaya ki jab vyakti saamaaj ke saath apane aapako alag mahasoos karne lagata he tab aatmahatya karne kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 a person who has faith in religion is relatively less likely to commit suicide
 isi prakaar unka maananaa tha ki vivaahit vyakti ke bajaay, avivaahit vyakti main aatmahatya karne kii pravriti zyada pai jaati he
 Thus Durkheim considered suicide as a social fact and gave more importance in analyzing it in its social context
 iske atirikt saamaajik tathy kii visheshta ko bataate hue unhone saamaajik tathy ko ek swatantra ikai ke rup main dekha
 He has called social fact as sui generis
 sui genaris se taatpary, saamaajik tathy kaa ek swatantra rup se apana astitv banaakar rakhana he
 He considered the social element an object
 arthath saamaajik tathy utana hi murtt he jitna ek vastu yaa cheez hoti he
 They do not require any other element, so they are independent
 is prakaar yah spasht ho jaataa he ki durkhim dwaara pratipaadit saamaajik tathy kii avadharana ek vaigyanik avadharana he jiske dwaara unhone samajashaastra main tathyon kaa saamaajik vishleshan ke aadhaar ko vaigyanik kasuti par sthapit karne kii koshish kii he
 The kind of analysis Durkheim has presented actually confirms the theory of positivism given by August Conte

 Synchronous speed, jahaan: The main parts of a synchronous motor are the stator and rotor
 isaki stater bhi preran motor ke samaan hi hoti he jis par teen-feji vinding kii gayi hoti he
 The magnetic field is generated either by a permanent magnet on the rotor or by giving DC to the electromagnets built on the rotor
 baahar se is disi ko roter par laane ke liye slip ring kaa prayog karnaa padataa he
 In large motors, a DC generator is placed on the same shaft
 isse praapt disi ko roter par bane vidyutchumbakon ko diya jaataa he
 Depending on the design, the rotor is of two types - tulykaalik motor ko 'over-iksite' karke chalaane par iske dwaara lee gayi dhara iske voltage se agragami hoti he
 On this basis, it can be used to increase the power coefficient
 isaki sabase acchhee baat yah he ki yadi lod kaa shakti-gunank parivartit ho rahaa ho to is motor kii field-viding kii dhara ko parivartit karke iske dwaara lee jane vaali dhara kaa shakti-gunank bhi is prakaar parivartit kiya ja saktaa he ki lod tathaa yah tulykaalik motor kaa sammilit shakti-gunank 1 ho jaay
