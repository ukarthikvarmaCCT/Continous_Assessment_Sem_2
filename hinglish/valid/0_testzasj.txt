 Under 'geographical Variables', the area of the region, climate, topography, demography, natural resources, and applied science etc
 come
 yah shabd sabase pehle rudolph zellen ne san 1899 main prayog kiya tha
 The aim of geopolitics is to study the relationship between states and the effect of geographical dimensions of their mutual position

 Halford John Mackinder's name is prominent among the leading thinkers of geopolitics
 unka san 1904 main chapa lekh da jeeographical poivat of history, bhuraajnneeti ke lekhan main ek adbhut misaal he
 Geopolitics became increasingly famous between World War i and World War II, but German thinkers made it the source of their own imperial ambitions, which led to this exploratory ideology
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad ise lagbhag nakaar diya gaya
 The Cold War peaking in the 90s and the re-recognition of this thinking by thinkers such as Brzenski proved the basis of revival for geopolitics

 The predominance of the concept of geopolitics is also related to the qualitative changes in imperialism at the end of the 19th century

 The boundaries of political governance were clearly visible

 Thus, after the creation of nations in the continents, their continental relations and inter-continental relations were influenced by their experiences of struggle against imperialism

 Geopolitics is the direction of the world order associated with the experiences of the colonial powers, so its thinking is a reflection of the experiences of the colonial era of each nation

 The word Agam is used for the basic texts of Jainism
 keval gyaan, manapryav gyani, avadhi gyani, chaturdashpurv ke dharak tathaa dashapurv ke dharak muniyon ko aagam kaha jaataa he
 Somewhere the holder of the new east has also been considered as a forward
 upachaar se inke vachanon ko bhi aagam kaha gaya he
 As long as Agam Bihari Muni existed, they did not have much importance, because till then the conduct of the conduct of the Munis was directed by the Agam Munis
 jab aagam muni nahin rahe, tab unke dwaara rachit aagam hi sadhana ke aadhaar maane gaye or unamem nirdisht nirdesan ke anusaar hi jain muni apni sadhana karte hai
 The term Agam is used for literature in Jain philosophy
 shrut, sutara, sutan, granth, siddhant, deshna, pragyapana, upadesh, aapt vachan, jin vachan, aitihya, amnaay aadi sabhi aagam ke paryaayavachi shabd he
 The word "aa" is derived from the prefix and gum metal
 'aa' upsarg kaa arth samantaat arthath purna or gam dhaatu kaa arth gati praapt he arthath jisase vastu tatva kaa purna gyaan ho vah aagam he athwa ye bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki aapt purush jineshwar rup main jo gyaan kaa upadesh dete he un shabdon ko ganadhar jinaki lipi baddh rup main rachana karte he un sutron ko aagam kehete he

 He is also called Ganipitaka or Dwadashangi: inamen drushtiwad kaa purnat: viched ho chukaa he
 a lot of the remaining eleven organs have also been amputated
 iske atirikt jitne aagam hai ve sab angabahm hai; kyonki angapravisht keval ganadhrakrut aagam hi maane jate hai
 Apart from the ganadas, Shrut Kevali, Purvadhar etc
 are considered as Agama Angabahm composed by knowledgeable men
 aagmon kii manyata ke vishay main bhinn bhinn paramparaayen hai
 Digambar Amnay has non-existent literature, he believes that the Agam has disappeared
 shwetambar amnaay main ek parampara 84 aagam maanati he, ek parampara uparyukt 45 aagmon ko aagam ke rup main sweekaar karti he tathaa ek parampara mahanishith oshaniryukti, pindaniryukti tathaa 10 prakeern sutron ko chhodkar shesh 32 ko sweekaar karti he
 The basic reason for this is that according to the Shvetambara tradition Acharya Devardhiginixama Shramana scripted 84 Agamas, but over time many Agamas were automatically destroyed, some were destroyed during the reign of Mughal rulers and many Agamas were so influential that they remembered The deities used to come, so to avoid the misuse of such learning, the saintly monks stored it
 bhagwaan mahavir se lekar aryarakshit tak aagmon kaa vargeekaran nahin hua tha
 Pravachak Arya Raksha categorized the Agams into four parts on the basis of subject for the convenience of the disciples

 They are called Ahle Sunnah or Sunni, who consider the way of the Quran and Prophet Muhammad Sahab as a way of passing on their lives
 These names are also used to describe themselves as separate from the Shia alias Rafaziyo, officially the elder in the Ahle Sunnah in South Asia
 Generally, three gangs come: Barelvi, Deobandi, Ahle Hadith or Salafi
 barelvi muhim dakshin asia main sufi andolan ke antargat ek up-andolan ko kaha jaataa he yah ahale sunnat val jamaat se nikali ek muhim hai jise unnisvin evam beesvin sadi ke bharat main rohelkhand sthit bareli se sunni vidwaan ahamed raja khan kadri ne prarambh kiya tha,
 Barelvi Sunni Hanafi is a large section of Barelvi Muslims who are now condensed in large numbers in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, South Africa and Britain
 aalaa hazarat imam ahamed raza kadri ne apni prasiddh fatwa rajavia ke madhyam se bharat main paaramparik or roodhiwaadee islam kaa bachaav karte hue apana mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 Deobandi Muheem was actually presented as a Sufi campaign by Ismail Dehlavi, the elder of the Deobandis, Alimo Qasim Nanotvi, Ashraf Ali Thanvi, Khalil Amethvi, who presented the Wahabiyat of Saudi Arabia to the South Asian Muslims
 dakshin asia ke zyaadaatar sunni barelvi hote hai
 Deobandi Sunni is also in large number
 ahale haddees vah sunni hai jo sufism main vishwaas nahin karte inhen salfi bhi kaha jaataa hai kyon kii ye islam ko us tarah samajhane or manane kaa daawa karte hai hai jis tarah salf ne quran or sunnat ko samajha, salfi sunni urf ahale haddees zayaadaatar saudi arab or qatar main hai
 They do not trouble any Imam

 The name was changed to Saudi Arabia in 1925 after the third and decisive occupation by Ala Saud over Arabia, and the heritage of religious and historical importance was demolished by the name of idolatry, including the tomb of Syeda Fatima and the tomb of Osman Gani
 barelvi ek naam diya gaya he sunni musalmaan ke giroh ko jo sufism main vishwaas rakhte hai or saikadon barason se islam suniyat ke maanane vaale hai
 People speak Barelvi because of the attachment of Ala Hazrat Imam Ahmed Raza Khan to Barelwio! They are also called Rajokhani, there are many reasons for the Ahle Sunnah wal Jamaat to be called Barelvi by the Wahhabi Deobandi ideology, in which it can also be a goal to call ourselves Sunni! In Sunni Jamaat, Ahmad Raza was the first to crack down on the mischievous books of Deobandi Aalim and make common Muslims aware of their false record! By writing Hasmul Haramain, he clarified that Darul Uloom Deoband is a school of false ideology in reality

 In 1876, it was decided by the government to purchase Upper Norwood and Lower Norwood, which were at the time the Lavarens Hospitality, and efforts were made to construct government housing in Ootacamund
 buckingham ke duk, jinhone is kharid kii pahal kii thi, ne donon norwood or garden cottage ko apane swaamitv main le liya
 After a one-time residence, the governor was convinced that Upper Norwood was not a suitable place for the governor to live
 madras lautne ke turant baad hi, duk ne do taleey bhawan kaa prastaav rakhaa jo governor ke parivaar ke liye sampoorn nivas or saarvajanik agavaani kamare vahan kar sake
 Between 1878 and 1881, various price estimates were prepared for the construction of the government residence and a final estimate of Rs 4,02,914 was approved
 lekin is moolyanumaan main bhawan ko sussajit karne kii laagat sammilit nahin thi or isliye july 1888 main ek vistrut moolyanumaan taiyaar kiya gaya jo 7,79,150 rupe kaa tha
 Eventually the government residence was built at a cost of Rs 7,82,633

 a small amount of carbon is healthy for the environment, but when excess it becomes irritating
 jeevashm eendhanon main carbon itane samay se maujuud he ki vah ab carbon cycle kaa hissaa hi nahin rah gai
 Carbon levels increase when fossil fuels burn
 byogas haalia mrit organism se banataa he, isliye yah vaataavaran main carbon str ko nahin bigaadti
 Biogas is also better than fossil fuel because it is cheaper and renewable energy

 atah khaanaa pakaane hetu gobar ke upalon ke sthaan par gobar se baio gas bana kar baio gas ko eendhan ke rup main prayog karne se poshak tatwon ki haani nahin hoti he kyonki baio gas se praapt baio gas slori main paudhon ke liye upyogi sabhi poshak tatva uplabdh rahete he, saath hi khaanaa banane main dhunaa nahin hota he jisase gruhani ki aankhon par koi pratikul asar bhi nahin padataa he
 Drying the bio gas slurry directly or under shade or by making vermicompost should be used in the fields as compost
 baio gas se aajkal dijal pump set bhi chalaa sakate he jisase dijal evam anya urja ki bachat hoti he
 In the biogas plant, after digestion of cow dung, 25% solids are converted into gas and 75% solids are converted to manure
 2 ghan meter ke gas sanyantr main jisamen kareeb 50 kilo gobar roj yaa 18-25 ton gobar ek varsh main daalaa jaataa he, us gobar se 80% namiyukt kareeb 10 ton byogas slori kaa khaad praapt hota he

 20% nitrogen amo in thin slurry produced from biogas plant
 Nickel is in the form of nitrogen, so if it is used immediately by making drains in the field or mixed with irrigation water and left in the field, then its benefit is like chemical fertilizer immediately on the crop and in production 10 to 20 byogas sanyantr main gobar kii pachan kriya ke baad 25% thos padaarth kaa roopaantar gas ke rup main hota he or 75% thos padaarth kaa roopaantar khaad ke rup main hota he
 In a 2 cubic meter gas plant, in which about 50 kg of cow dung or 18-25 tons of dung is added in a year, about 10 tons of biogas slurry containing 80% moisture is obtained from that cow dung
 yah kheti ke liye ati uttam khaad hota he isamen nitrogen 1
5 se 2% phosphorus 1
0% evam potash 1
0% tak hota he
 When the fertilizer comes out in the form of slurry from the biogas plant, the nitrogen is present in the slurry as much nitrogen is also present in the slurry, but during the digestion in the plant, there is evidence of carbon conversion in the gas due to reduced carbon nitrogen
 The ratio decreases and the evidence of nitrogen appears to be increased

 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200 ~ 350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150 
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 "tool received critical acclaim from CB Liddell of the International Herald Tribune for his complex and ever-evocative voice

 The number of syllables in each line of Latralus' lyrics is consistent with the arrangement of Fibonacci numbers and refers to and refers to a common metrical foot yamb in "jambi" songs

 And this is almost exactly the same figure: a three-note vocal chime with a special accent derived from the guitar

 " unhone yah bhi spasht kiya, "main kabhi tul kaa ek prashansak hua karata tha

 This structure is envisaged by compensating the promoters of the company's products to create marketing and sales forces, not only for the sales generated by them personally, but also for the sale of other promoters that they have introduced to the company, By which a hierarchy of multi-level compensation is created, a bottom line of distributors and a pyramidal ensemble

 The MLM business operates in all 50 states of the United States and in more than 100 other countries, and new businesses may use terms such as "affiliate marketing" or "home based business facilitation"
 tathaapi, kai pyramid yojanaayen khud ko vaid MLM kaarobaar ke rup main pesh karne kii koshish karti hai
 The FTC states "avoid the multi-level marketing scheme that pays commissions to recruit new distributors
" ve vastav main avaidh pyramid yojanaayen hai
 Why is pyramid construction dangerous? Because schemes that pay commissions for the recruitment of new distributors inevitably collapse when no new distributors are recruited
 And when a plan collapses, most people get nothing, except for a few who are probably at the very top of the pyramid
 " a 2004 letter from the US Federal Trade Commission Staff Advisory to the Direct Selling Association states: haal ke varshon main vyaktigat, yaa aantarik, upbhog mudde par bahut kuch kaha gaya he
 In fact, the amount of internal consumption in any multi-level compensatory business does not determine whether the FTC would consider a plan a pyramid scheme
 The key question for the FTC is whether the revenue that supports the commission paid to all participants is generated from the sale of goods and services that are simply incidental to the purchase of the right to participate in the earning enterprise
 Are not
 FTC chetavanee detaa he "sabhi bahu-stareey vipanan yojanaayen vaid nahin hai
 There are some pyramid schemes

 However, Amway was found guilty of exaggerating claims of pricing and income
 FTC ne salaah di ki aise bahu-stareey vipanan sanghathanon ko shankaa kii drushti se dekha janaa chahie, jo utpaada bikri se juyada, bhartee ko badhaava dete hai
