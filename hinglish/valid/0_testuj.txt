 himayugon ke dauraan aise jamini pul aksar ubhar aate hai kyonki tab samudr ke pani kaa kuch ansh barf main jamaa hua hone se samudr-tal thodaa neeche hota he
 a great example of this is Ram Sethu connecting India to Sri Lanka
 yah himayugon main puri tarah samudr-tal ke upar ubhari hui zamin kii ek pattee hoti thi jisapar itihaas main jaanavar chalakar bharat se srilanka pahunche the or bharat se bahut se ped-paudhe bhi srilanka main vistrut hue the
 It is believed that about 20,000 years ago today, the ancestors of the Vaidya tribals of Sri Lanka also walked on the same land bridge from India to Sri Lanka on foot
 aadhunik yug main bharat or srilanka ke bich 40 mile kaa khulaa samudr he Apart from ice age, there can be more reasons to build ground bridges
 kabhi-kabhi plate vivartaniki main bhugolic takhton ke hilne se samudr ke neeche kaa farsh upar uthakar sataha se upar aa jaataa he or do kshetron ko ek pul banaakar jod detaa he
 In some areas the icebergs moving during the Ice Age are so heavy that the land beneath them is submerged and the ice rises after the ice melts at the end of the Ice Age
 kabhi-kabhi yahi himyug-uparant uthi hui dharti do kshetron main pul bana detii he
 Vaishampayan was a learned disciple of Veda Vyasa
 hinduon ke do mahakavyon main se ek mahabharat ko maanav jati main prachlit karne kaa shrey unheen ko jaataa he
 This story was narrated by Vaishampayan during a yajna to Janamejaya, son of Mahabali Parikshit, grandson of the Pandavas
 krishna yajurveda ke pravartak bhi rishi vaishampayan hi he jinhe unke guru krishnadwaipayan ne yah karya saupa tha
 His disciple Yajyavalkya was a sage from whom Yajnavalkya transmitted Shukla Yajurveda due to a debate
 jaise jihva ke aswaad ke chah ras prasiddh hai usee prakaar hriday ke aswaad ke nau ras prasiddh hai
 The taste of lingua is placed in the category of cosmic bliss because it is directly related to cosmic objects
 hriday ke aswaad ko alokik anand kii koti main mana jaataa he kyonki uskaa sidhaa samb Indian poetesses have considered the number of rasas to be nine only because by their opinion there are only nine expressions which are closely related to the basic instincts of man and have full potential for stability and they can only be developed and said to possess the noun of rasa
 Huh
 yah manyata vivaadaaspad bhi rahi he, parantu hasya kii rasarupata ko sabhi se nirvivaad rup se sweekaar kiya he
 Psychology experts have also given Haas a proper place as the original trend and have given adequate consideration in its analysis
 is manan chintan ko paurvatya kavyachaaryon kii apeksha paashchaatya kavyachaaryon ne vistaarpurvak abhivyakti di he, parantu phir bhi yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki unhone is tatv kaa puri vyapaktaa ke saath adhyayan kar liya he or yaa hasyaras yaa haas kii kavyagat abhivyanjana kii hi koi aisi paribhaasha de di he jo sabhi sabhi prakaar ke udaahranon ko apane main samet sake
 Indian Acharyas have promulgated this in a form of formulas, but in their brief statements, almost all the findings and elements of Western critics can be easily seen
 hasyaras ke liye bharat muni kaa naatyashaastra kahata he- It is written in Bhavaprakash- sahityadarpanakaar kaa kathan he- The phrase of the decider is- taatpary yah he ki haas ek pritiparak bhav he or chittavikas kaa ek rup he
 He is perplexed by distorted shape, distorted speech, distorted ethics, distorted designation, distorted decking, distorted semantics, distorted speech, distorted gestures, etc
 - the humor with these distortions, whether of the actor, of the speaker, or of anyone else
 
 vikruti kaa taatpary he pratyaashit se vipareet athwa vilakshan koi aisa vaichitrya, koi aisa betukapan, jo hamen pritikar jaan pade, kleshkar na jaan pade
 These traits include almost all the symptoms of western critics, as far as they are concerned with humor subjects
 aisa haas jab viksit hokar hamen kavikaushal dwaara saadharaneekrut rup main, athwa acharya pan
 ramchandra shukla kii shabdaawalee ke anusaar, mukt dasha main praapt hota he, vah hasyaras kehalaata he
 The expression of the sense of Haas remains relative to the country
 ghar par koi khuli deh baitha ho to darshak ko hansee na aavegi parantu utsav main bhi vah isi tarah pahunch jaae to uskaa aacharan pratyaashit se vipareet yaa vikrut mana jane ke kaaran hansee jagaa degaa; uskaa vyavhaar haas kii janani ho jayega
 If a young person is adorned, it is a matter of boredom, but a shabby old man will have a reason for adornment; We will surely start laughing at the wrestler who has fallen from the chair, but only our compassionate sympathy will grow on the child falling from the roof
 yah pehle hi kaha gaya he ki haas kaa aadhaar priti par hota he na ki dwesh par, atev yadi kisi kii prakruti, pravriti, swabhaav, aachaar aadi kii vikruti par kataaksh bhi karnaa ho to vah katukti ke rup main nahin kintu priyokti ke rup main hogi, uski tah main jalan athwa nicha dikhaane kii bhaavana na hokar vishuddh sanshuddhi kii bhaavana hogi
 This eloquence with a sense of purification will not be in the vocabulary of preaching but in the terminology of Ranjata
 hasya ke bhedon par bhi aacharyon ne vichaar kiya he
 He made two distinctions of humor
 ek he aatmasth or doosraa he parastha
 From the point of view of comedians, selfish humor is automatically the laughing of that character and superstitious humor is to make others laugh
 saamaajikon yaa sahruday shrotaaon, athwa natyadarshakon kii drushti se aatmasth hasya he anyon kii hansee ke bina swat: unamem udbhut hasya or parastha hasya he dusron ko hansataa hua dekhakar unamem utpann hasya
 By understanding this difference of perspectives, the idea of the meanings of these two words can be easily eliminated
 phir, aacharyon ne hasya ke chah bhed kiye hai - smit, hasith, vihasit, upahasit, avahasit or atihasit; jinhen bhavbhed nahin kintu hasankriya ke hi bhed maananaa padegaa
 In short, smiling eyes are smitten
 battisi dikh padana hasith he, ho hi kii si dhwani nikal padana vihasit he
 Rise of limb is absent
 pet pakadaneyvaali hansee avahasit he or puure thahaakevali jhakzorkarini paslithod hansee atihasit he
 The philosopher has called Smit and Hasit worthy of the best
 vihasit or upahasit ko madhyam vargeey logon ke yogya or apasit tathaa atihasit ko neech logon ke yogya kaha he
 There should be a dignity in the theater for the audience to laugh, even from that point of view, it may be considered good, moderate, inadequate
 nahin to jhakzor denevaali hansee keval nichon kii vastu samaj lene se ucch vargeey lok swasthya ke ek mahatvapurn tatv se vanchit rah jaaenge
 Dr
 Ramkumar Varma has considered three distinctions of humor with a desire for the effect of Uttam, Madhyam, Adham and has written twelve distinctions of Hasan Kriya by multiplying them with Athastha, Prastha
 smit, hasith aadi hasankriyaabhedon ko hasya kaa anubhav hi kaha ja saktaa he
 It is a different thing to just describe these experiences and it is a different thing to create these experiences in the social through your creation
 hasyaras kii safal rachana vah he jo hasyaras ke anubhav anayas utpann kara de
 There are five major differences of humor from the opinion of foreign scholars, namely Humer, Witt, Satire, Irony and Fars
 humar or fars hasya ke vishay se sambandhit hai jabaki bit, satair or irni kaa sambandh ukti ke kaushal se he jinamein pichley do kaa uddeshy keval santushti hi na hokar sanshuddhi bhi rahaa karata he
 Parody is also a genre of humor that has a relationship with the above skills but whose main purpose is satisfaction
 irni kaa arth parihaas chintya he
 In ridicule, we think, Irony should also be considered to have an inferiority or else it will become an object out of humor
 vit athwa vagvaidadhya ko ek vishisht alankaar kaha ja saktaa he
 The tithes of Indian literary scholars have done justice to Shringar, even with humor, though Bharata Muni has given its origin to Shringar i
e
 it is considered to be the magnitude of Rati or Preity and it was only after Shringar that the status of importance in Navaras Have given
 anand ke saath iskaa sidhaa sambandh he or na keval ranjanta kii drushti se kintu upyogita kii drushti se bhi isaki apni vishistataa he
 This body removes the tension of the mind, eradicates the grit of nature, paves the way for social improvement with introspection and self-refinement, eliminating the tiredness of the individual and society, fostering freshness in them and becoming a benefactor of public health
 yah nishchit he ki sanskrit sahitya tathaa hindi sahitya main is hasyaras ke mahatv ke anupaat se iske uttam udaahranon kii kami hi he
 Yet from the historical overview it is also clear that the flow of humor in literature has been going on continuously since the Vedic period till today, although before the present period, it is not as diverse as it is seen today
 hasyaras kii dhara ke vaividhya ko vishay or vyanjana kii drushti se dekha ja saktaa he
 We can divide the subject into shape, nature, situation, dress, speech, behavior and object
 akruti kaa betukapan he motopa, kurupata, bhaddaapan, angabhang, beja najaakat, tond, kubad, naariyon kaa atyant kaalaapan, aadi
 Humorous compositions have been done on many of these subjects
 dhyaan dene yogya baat he ki ek samay kaa haasyaaspad vishay sabhi samayon kaa haasyaaspad vishay ho jaae, aisa nahin hua karata
 Today, disgrace, cleanliness, etc
 are not considered as the subjects of humor, hence, making compositions on them will not be considered as a symbol of humor
 prakruti yaa swabhaav kaa betukapan he ujaddpan, bevakoofi, paakhand, jhenp, khushaamad, amaryadit fashanparasti, kanjusee, dikhaava panditmanyata, atihasypatrata, anadhikarpurn ahanmanyta, aadi
 Composing the absurdity of nature as your goal is more expansive than the absurdity of nature
 rachanakaaron ne kanjusee aadi kii vrittiyon par achche vyang kiye hai, parantu abhi is disha main anek vishay achoote hi chhot gaye hai
 The absurdity of the situation is the added Gangmadari, the lapse of time, the helplessness of a person etc
 in the incompatibility of society
 iskaa atyant sundar udhaaharan he ramcharitamanas kaa kevat prasang jisamen ram kaa marm samaj jane kii ding haakanevaale murkh kintu panditmanya kevat ko ram koi uttar nahin de pate or ek prakaar se chupchaap aatmasamarpan kar dete hai
 It was a satire of circumstance
 vesh kaa betukapan, haspaatr naton or vidushakon kaa priy vishay hi rahaa he or prahasanon, ramlilaon, raasalilaon, "gammat", tamaashon aadi main aasaani se diya ja saktaa he
 Dharmadhvajis disguise, disguised fashionistas, "masculine woman" disguise are absurd ones that can be the subject of creation
 vesh ke betukepan kii rachana bhi akruti ke betukepan kii rachana ke samaan praaia: chhichley darje kii hogi
 The absurdity of speech is to stutter, to put a pillowcase like "which is so" on the matter, to utter ejaculations, inhuman sounds, boiling of boonies, gossiping, panditau, ganwaru language, slang of many language words, etc
 vyavhaar kaa betukapan he asamanjas ghatnaayen, foohad harakatein, atiranjana, charitrik vikruti, saamaajik uchhrankhaltaayen, kuch kaa kuch samaj baithna, kah baithna yaa kar baithna, kathputlipan ityadi
 The absurdity of behavior can provide abundant material for the expression of humor, whether it is in the sense of humor or ridicule
 vastu kii drushti se manushya hi kyon, dev daanav pashu pakshi, khatmal machhar, jhaadoo, tokani, plate rashning aadi anek vishyon par safaltarpuk kalmen chalaai gai hai
 But as far as the fun of these items and especially with the favored gods and administrative satire, will be said to be an officer of the category of humor
 khizabhari anya rachanaayen raudra, vibhats yaa anya rason kii koti main pahunch ja sakati hai
 The expression of anticipation in expression can be seen and shown in many ways
 ise betukapan, vikruti, asamanjasata aadi shabdon se thik thik nahin samajhaayaa ja saktaa
 It is the speech that requires enough talent even in the creator and in the creator, listener or reader of that creation
 jis saamaajik main hasya kii ichha or aashaa na hogi, swabhaav main vinodpriyata or hasyonmukhataa na hogi tathaa buddhi ke shabdasanketon or vaakyagat angon ko samajhane kii kshamta na hogi, samajhnaa chahie ki uske liye hasyaras kii rachanaayen he hi nahin
 Similarly, an artist who does not have sophistication, counterproductive and the art of word weighing cannot be a successful writer of humor
 safal lekhak apratyaashit shabdadambar ke sahare, shabd kii apratyaashit vyutpatti ke sahare ; apratyaashit vilakshan upamaaon aadi alankaaron ke sahare ; vilakshan tarkoktiyon ke sahare ; vagvaidagdhya kii anek vidhaon ke sahare yatha, arth ke pher badal ke sahare pratyutar main nahale kii jagah dahala lagane kii kala ke sahare ; satair ke sahare "", krishnayan main uddhav kii ukti kii bhawan jaraihai madhupuri, shyaam bajaihain benu? bhavaniprasad mishra ji kaa geetfarosh aadi), kataaksh ke sahare ke sahare ; virup vachananukaran ke sahare ; tathaa isi prakaar kii anekanek abhivyanjana shaileyon se hasyaras kaa udrek karaayaa karte hai
 From our point of view, in our understanding humor is either especially of humor or of ridicule
 in donon shabdon ko hamane paramparaagat arth main seemaabaddh nahin kiya he
 We consider the satisfaction of poetry as a category of gimmick and the one who is pure in a sense of ridicule
 anek rachanaaon main donon kaa mishran bhi hua karata he
 It is necessary to take care of the list of socials for both humor and ridicule
 maansal shringarparak haas, aajkal ke shisht samaaj ko ruchikar nahin ho saktaa
 The satirical deity is used to make the cuckoos laugh
 uphaas ke liye suruchi kaa dhyaan atyant aavashyak he
 The fun in this is that the comedian should understand his errors but also be taken care of by the signer and do not see it as a preacher
 bina vyang ke haas ko parihaas samajhie, chaahe vah varnanaatmak ho chaahe vaartalap kii koti kaa or apane par athwa anya par, visheshat: anya par, vyang karke jo prabhaav dikhaaya jaataa he vah uphaas he hi
 The harm generated by the use of bits, humors, parodies, etc
, which is of the order of pure satisfaction, will be called a joke
 anubhav kii drushti se hasyaras ko mriduhas kii koti kaa samajhnaa chahie yaa attas kii koti kaa
 Other categories like Hasit, Kidnapped etc
 should be taken into account
 mriduhas ke do bhi kiye ja sakate hai, ek he gupt haas jiskaa anand man hi man liya jaataa he or doosraa he sfoot haas jiskaa muskaraahat aadi ke rup main anya jan bhi darshan kar sakate hai
 Two distinctions can also be made of attahas - one is the restrained hay which is controlled by the laughing situation and the other is the amaryad hasa in which the situation is not aware of relativity
 hasya ke bhedon kaa yah vivechan sambhavat: adhik vaigyanik hoga
 Skit in the plays and the presence of the clown have created humor but have not been versatile
 subhashit ke kai shloke avashya achche ban pade hai jinamein vishay or ukti donon drushtiyon se hasya kii acchhee avatarana kii gai he
 It will not be irrelevant to give some examples
 devataaon ke sambandh kaa majaak dekhie
 The question was why did Shankar ji drink poison? The poet's answer is that bored with the condition of his family
 shankar ji kaa saanp ganesh ji ke chuuhe kii taraf jhapat rahaa he kintu swat: usapar kartikeya ji kaa mor daanv lagaae hue he
 On the other hand, the lion of Girija is keeping a watchful eye on Ganesh ji's gajamastak and Girija ji is also frantically keeping a soutiadaah from the Ganges
 samarth hokar bhi bechaare shankar ji is besangi gruhasthi se kaise paar pate, isliye uubakar jehar pi liya
 Tridev does not sleep on the bed
 jaan padataa he khatmalon se ve bhi bhaybheet ho chuke hai
 The son-in-law considers his mother-in-law a matter of essence, but still what rudeness does he expect to get his worship done or see in the following verses
 donon hi shloke paryaapt kavyagunayukt hai
 The more you analyze, the more you will enjoy: parann priy ho ki praan, isapar kavi kaa nishkarsh suniye- Raja Bhoj had announced that the one who created the new verse would get one lakh rupees in the prize, but no one was able to get the award because the meritorious courtier Pandit would repeat the new verse as soon as he heard it and thus declare it old
 kinvadanti ke anusaar kalidas ne nimna shloke sunaakar boli band kar di thi
 In the verse, the poet has claimed that the king should free the father from ninety-nine million jewels and take the evidence of the pandits on it
 yadi panditgan kahen ki yah daawa unhen vidit nahin he to phir is nae shloke kii rachana ke liye ek lakh die hi jaaen
 The "kaisa Chhakaaya" sense of it is embodied with great beauty: hindi ke virgthakaal, bhaktikaal or reetikaal praaia: padyon ke hi kaal rahe hai
 In this long period, the compositions of humor have been rare, but they have often been in the form of retail
 tulsidas ji ke ramcharimanas kaa naradamoh prasang shivvivaah prasang, parashuram prasang aadi or surdaas ji ke sursagar kaa makhanchori prasang, uddhav-gopi-samvaad prasang aadi alabatta hasya ke achche udhaaharan prastut karte hai
 The following verse of Tulsidas ji, in which a funny pinch has been made on the Shringarlalasa of Jarajarjar ascetics, is unique in its verses- birbal ke chutkule, laal bujhakkad ke latake, ghaagh or bhaddari kii sukhtiyaan, giradhar kaviry or gang ke chand, benny kaviraj ke bhadauve tathaa or bhi kai rachanaayen is kaal kii prasiddh hai
 Bharatjeevan Press published some compilation of retail comedies of this period in its "bharova collection"
 is kaal main, visheshat: daan ke prasang ko lekar, kuch maarmik rachanaayen hui hai jinaki rochakata aaj bhi kam nahin kahi ja sakati
 See example - ek sum ne sankat main tuladaan karnaa kabool kar liya tha
 For that, look at his tricks to lose weight - vartmaan kaal main hasya ke vishyon or unki abhivyakti karne kii shaileyon kaa bahut vistaar hua he
 In this era, along with poetry, many genres of prose have also developed
 pramukh hai naatak tathaa ekanki, upanyaas tathaa kahaniyaan, evam niabandh
 In all these genres, abundant literature is written and is being written to suit the humor
 pratibhashali lekhakon ne padya ke saath hi gadhy kii vividh vidhaon main bhi apni hasyarasvardhini rachanaayen prastut kii hai
 The most famous litterateur of the early days of this era is Bharatendu Babu Harishchandra
 inke naatakon main vishuddh hasyaras kam, vagvaidagdhya kuch adhik or uphaas paryaapt maatra main paaya jaataa he
 "vaidiki Violence Violence Na Bhavati", "andher Nagri" etc
 are his comedies
 unka "chuuran kaa lataka" prasiddh he
 Lala Srinivasa Das, Pratapnarayan Mishra, Radhakrishnadas, Premaghan, Balakrishna Bhatt etc
 of his era have also composed comedies
 pratapanarayan mishra ne "kalikauthuk roopak" naamak sundar prahasan likhaa he
 His poem titled "budhapa" is a masterpiece of pure humor
 us samay angreji rajya apane gaurav par tha jisaki pratyaksh aalochana khatre se khaali nahin thi
 Therefore, litterateurs, especially satire and derision were the way to go and tried to awaken the reformist social consciousness through sipa, hajo, quibble, satire etc
 bhaaratendukaal ke baad mahaviraprasad dvivedi kaal aayaa jisane hasya ke vishyon or unki abhivyanjana pranaaliyon kaa kud or adhik parishkar evam vistaar kiya
 In plays, the purpose of humor, which used to play an antecedent or a sequel to the main story, often ended in the Dwivedi period, and the subject was no longer necessary for the genre of humor
 kavy main "sargau narak thekana naahin" sadrush rachanaayen saraswati aadi patrikaon main saamne ai
 Balmukund Gupta and Pt
 Jagannath Prasad Chaturvedi were good writers of humor in that era
 pratham ne "bhashaa kii ansthirataa" naamak apni lekhamala "atmaram" naam se likhi or duusare sajjan ne "nirankushta-nidarshan" naamak lekhamala "mansaram" naam se
 Both of them have clashed with Dwivedi in these garlands and his discussion of this idea remained for a long time among the literati
 balmukund gupt ji kaa shivashambhu kaa chittha, chandradhar sharma guleri kaa kachuva dharm, mishrabandhu or badrinath bhatta ji ke anek naatak, shri harishankar sharma ke niabandh, naatak aadi, ganga prasad shrivastav or ugr ji ke anek prahasan or anek kahaniyaan, apane apane samay main jansadharan main khub samaadrut hui
 G
 In P
 Srivastava, he made a splash in the field of humor by writing vicissitudes, long beards etc
, although his humor has remained shallow
 niraala ji ne sundar vyangatmak rachanaayen likhi hai or unke kulli bhaath, chaturi chamaar, sukul kii bibi, billesur bakriha, kukurmutta aadi paryaapt prasiddh he
 Pt
 Vishwambharanath Sharma Kaushik is certainly well-known in this field by writing 'letters of Vijayanand Dubey' etc
 shivapujan sahay or hajariprasad dvivedi ne "hasyaras ke sahitya kii acchhee shrivriddhi kii he
 We can call Annapurnanand Verma the special writer of humor
 unke "mahakavi chachcha", "meri hazaamat," "magan rahu chola", mangal mod", "man mayur" sabhi suruchipurna hai
 In the present period, Upendranath Ashk has written many new ideas like "lift the curtain, drop the curtain" etc
 dow ramkumar verma kaa ekanki sangrah "rimjhim" is kshetra main mile kaa pathar mana gaya he
 He has given good samples of smite humor
 devraj dinesh, udaishankar bhatta, bhagwaticharan verma, prabhakar machave, jayanath nalin, bedab banarsi, kantanath chonch," bhaiya ji banarsi, gopalprasad vyas, kaaka haathrasi, aadi anek sajjanon ne anek vidhaon main rachanaayen kii hai or hasyaras ke sahitya ko khub samrudh kiya he
 Many of these authors have received good praise from many works
 bhagwaticharan verma kaa "apane khilone" hasyaras ke upanyaason main vishisht sthaan rakhata he
 Yashpal's "chakkar Club" is famous for satire
 krishnachandra ne "ek gadhe kii aatmakatha" aadi likhakar vyang lekhakon main yashaswita praapt kii he
 Gangadhar Shukla's "morning Happens Evening Happens" keeps its unique genre
 rahul sankrutyaayan, seth govind das, shrinarayan chaturvedi, amritlal nagar, dow barasanelal ji, vasudev goswami, bedadak ji, wipro ji, bharatbhushan agarwal aadi ke naam ginaae ja sakate hai jinhone kisi na kisi rup main sahitya ke is upadey ang kii samruddhi kii he
 Many specific works of other languages have also been translated into Hindi
 kelkar ke "subhashit ani vinod" naamak gaveshanapurna marathi granth ke anuwaad ke atirikt moliye ke naatakon kaa, "gulivers travells" kaa, "don quickzot" kaa, sarshar ke "phisaane azaad" kaa, rabindranath tagore ke natyakauthuk kaa, parashuram, azeembeg chaghtai aadi kii kahaniyon kaa, anuwaad hindi main uplabdh he
 Shah is another term used for 'king' in Iran, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent
 yah farsi bhashaa se liya gaya he or puraani farsi main iskaa rup 'khshaaynteey ' tha
 Note that being sisters of the indo-iranian language family, there are homogeneous words for 'shah' in Sanskrit and Persian
 sanskrit main ek kriya 'kshayati' he yani 'vah raaj karata he', jis se milti hui puraani farsi bhashaa main kriya se 'khshaaynteey' shabd bana tha
 The same word 'khaiyathayati' is found in the inscriptions of the Hakhamani kingdom of Iran
 iskaa sanskrit sajaateey shabd 'kshatra' he jis se 'kshatreey' bana he
 In ancient Persian, 'empire' was called 'kshathatra', which is equivalent to 'area' of Sanskrit
 aadhunik farsi main 'khshaaynteey' kaa 'shah' or 'kshastra' kaa 'shahar' ban gaya he
 The meaning of the city is reduced from 'empire' to 'city' although it is sometimes used with the ancient meaning, for example 'city of Iran' means 'kingdom / nation of Iran'
 'kshastra' ke uccharan main bindu-vaale 'kh' ke uccharan par or bindu-vaale 'ji' ke uccharan par dhyaan den kyonki ve bindu-rahit 'kha' or bindu-rahit 'tha' se zaraa bhinn hai
 In India, such a king or Maharaja was called 'maharajadhiraja', under which kings of many kingdoms
 usee tarah farsi main 'shahon ke shah' ko 'shahanshah' kehete hai
 In the old Persian language of the Hakhamani kingdom, its title was equal to 'kshyathiyya Kshyathiyanam' which is seen in the records of Beastun
 farsi kaa 'zaadaa' shabd 'putr' yaa 'kumaar' kaa or 'zaadi' shabd 'putree' yaa 'kumari' kaa arth rakhte hai
 'shehzada' means 'prince' and 'shehzadi' means 'princess'
 dhyaan den ki 'zaadaa' kaa bhi ek sanskrit sajaateey shabd he
 'phalan-zada' means 'borne by such and such', such as 'amirzada', 'raizada', 'raiszada', 'shehzada', etc
 sanskrit main isaki barabaari kaa shabd 'jaat' yaa 'jaataa' or hindi main 'jaaya' he, jaisaa ki 'navjaat' jaise shabdon main dekha jaataa he
 In Hindi, 'shehzada' will be called 'shah Ka Jaya' and if viewed from a strict Sanskrit perspective, 'shehzada' is homogeneous of the 'kshatriyatas' of Sanskrit
 farsi main 'banu' shabd kaa matlab 'mahila' he or 'shahbanu' kaa matlab 'rajasi mahila' he, jo ki naam bhartiya upmahadweep main bahut mahilaon kaa hota he
 Similarly, a name 'shahdokht' is found in Iran, Tajikistan and Afghanistan which is not common in India and Pakistan
 iskaa arth 'shah kii beti' hota he
 In this, 'dokht' is an abbreviation of the word 'dokhtar' of Persian - note that it also has a close Sanskrit homogeneous word 'duhitru', which also means 'daughter'

222722 Charles Dickens was the most popular English novelist of the Victorian era, as well as a member of a powerful social movement

 In resistance welds, mechanical pressure along with electric current is used to connect two pieces of metal
 weldon electrodon main us samay dhara bahati he jab veld kiye ja rahe donon tukade aapas main jud rahe hote hai
 In this process of Weldon, the first electric current produces at least enough heat in a small part of the metals to liquefy there
 iske baad dono tukade kuch der tak dabaakar hi rakhe jate hai taaki pighali hui dhaatu thandi ho jaay or usamen aaps main jude rahane ke liye paryaapt shakti aa jaay
 Flamation weldons, spots, projections, suture and percussion methods are the main methods of pratirodh weldon dwaara weldon main damak weldon, chitti, prakshepi, sivan or takkar kii vidhiyaan mukhya hai
 This method of Weldon is also similar to the Weldon method of collision, the only difference being that the current is fed into the device before the two bodies are in contact and the electric current in the gap between the bodies when approaching them
 The current of the arc leads to melting of the edges of the micelles
 jab dhaatu ke kuch chhite unamem se uchhalane lagate hai, tab dhara ko band kar yantra se hi unhen dabaakar jod dete hai
 This method of Weldon is adopted where the edges of the metal sheets are folded one by one
 iskaa siddhant bhi takkar ke weldon ke samaan hi he
 Its principle is also similar to that of percussion weldons
 is kaam ke yantra main, weldon karanevaale kinaaron ko ek duusare ke upar neeche rakhkar, yantra main lage do electrodon ke bich main rakh dete hai
 Then pressing a lever with the foot, the uppermost electrode descends down and suppresses those plates with the power of compressed air and as soon as it comes in contact with the electrodes and the plates, an electric current flows through it and enters the bottom electrode passing through the plates
 Is, at that time the portion of the plates that come in contact with those electrodes is heated and reaches the temperature of the weldon, those electrodes Issues of pressure and extended, so that they are aligned with each other on the place and there is likely a spot C
 weldon kii is vidhi ke siddhant bhi ve hi hai ja chitti weldon ke hai, keval bhed yahi he ki isamen electrode se praapt honevaali ooshmaa ek chote se bindu par hi kendrit kar di jaati he
 By the way, the area of electrodes is quite large
 ooshmaa ko kendrit karne ke liye ek athwa donon platon main ubhaar yaa gaddha bana diya jaataa he
 By this method, plates of different thicknesses can also be joined together
 yah vidhi bhi siddhant or kriya main chitti weldon ke samaan hi he, antar yahi he ki electrode sthir stambh ke aakaar ke hone ke badale belanaakaar ghoomte hue banaae jate hai or judanevaale platon ko unke bich yantra se chalaaya jaataa he tathaa un belanon kii vidyut dhara aantrayik rup se chatka lagaati hui chalati he
 The ratio of the flow of flow and stoppage time can be kept from 1: 1 to 1:10, so the joint looks as if it is given by a string
 is vidhi main mashin ke ek shikanje main ek tukade ko pehle sthirataa se baandhakar, duusare tukade ko sarkanevaale duusare shikanje main is prakaar band dete hai
 That when bringing the two closer, the joint fits right
 yah donon shikaje vidyutrodhi aavarnon dwaara i duusare se vidyutarodhi aavarnon dwaara ek-duusare se vidyutruddh rahete hai or inamen vidyut dhara dene ke ek kii dhara duusare main nahin jane paati
 When the sliding screws move along the cladding to the stationary shingle, the heat of the joining edges of these gases reaches the heat of the weldon when approaching the edges, being overheated by the effect of the high resistance of the current
 Then the edges are gradually pressed down and the current is stopped

 Hyder Ali's demise and Tipu Sultan's reign in the late 18th century is a major event in Mysore
 With the arrival of Tipu Sultan, the British imperialist policy reached a tremendous foundation, on the one hand, the company government was expanding its nascent British Empire
 On the other hand, Tipu, on the other hand, was determined to protect Mysore on the strength of his valor and diplomacy
 Thus, in the late 18th century, Tipu was a great ruler who tried to expel the British from India
 apane pita haidar ali ke pashchaat 1782 main tipu sultan mysore kii gaddi par baitha
 Like his father, he was a highly skilled commander and a clever diplomat
 That is why he always wanted to avenge the defeat of his father from the British, the British were quite afraid of him
 tipu kii akruti main angrejon ko nepolian kii tasviir dikhaai padati thi
 He was a master of many languages, he started taking administrative service and warfare in his father's time, but his greatest demerit was that he was a stubborn and arrogant person
 yahi durgun uske paraajay kaa kaaran bana vah francisiyon par bahut adhik bharosa karata tha or deshi raajaaon ki shaktiyon ko tukshya samajhataa tha vah apane pita ke samaan hi nirankush or svantrtaachari tha lekin phir bhi praja ke takalifon kaa use kaaphi dhyaan rahata tha
 Thus, the peasants were happy during his reign, he was not a religion despite being a staunch Muslim
 He looked at Hindus and Muslims with a single eye, was also a great reformer and tried to improve in the direct field of governance
 uske charitra ke sambandh main vidwaanon ne kaaphi matbhed he
 Criticizing him, various British scholars have described him as tyrannical and righteous

 From the treaty of Mangalore, the drama of British Mysore war could not end, both sides did not consider this treat to be permanent, in 1786 AD Lord Cornwallis became the Governor General of India, he was not able to interfere in the internal affairs of the Indian states, but that Seeing the situation at the time, he had to intervene because at that time Tipu Sultan was his great enemy, so the British gave their Thiti Tipu this has the agreement with the regime to strengthen the person who wants to set up its head in both South hand for friendship Fransisio

 Critics say that Cornwallis was in a hurry to make the treaty and by not having the full residence of Tipu that if he had crushed Tipu's power, there would not have been a fourth Mysore War in the future, but in fact Carnavalis had not done his visionary
 At that time, the English army was sick and there was a possibility of war between England and France in Europe
 The Marathas and the Nizams would have started burning with it if the British had merged the entire state with the British, so the Carnavalis' aim was that the power of Tipu would be exhausted and at the same time the company's friends could not become powerful
 He attempted to crush Tipu's power without making his friends powerful

 Sometimes Kashi passed into the hands of Vatsas, sometimes Magadha and sometimes Kosal
 parswanath ke baad or buddha se kuch pehle, kosal-shravasti ke raja kansa ne kaashi ko jitkar apane raaj main mila liya
 King Mahakoshal of the same clan then married his daughter Kosal Devi to King Bimbasar of Magadha as a dowry and started giving annual income of one lakh rupees per annum to Kashi and thus Kashi came under the control of Magadha
 raaj ke lobh se magadh ke raja bimbsar ke bete ajatshatru ne pita ko markar gaddi chin lee
 Then his brother Prasenjit, the brother of Kosal, saddened by the grief of the widowed sister Kosaladevi, stopped giving Kashi's income to Ajatshatru, which resulted in Magadha and Kosal Summer

 Ultimately Ajatshatru won and Kashi merged into his growing empire
