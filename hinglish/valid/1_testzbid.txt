 unhen kuch dar-sa laga or ve waapas apane gaanv chale gayi, kintu neend nahin aayi or baar-baar usee par vichaar karte hue unki jaise hi ankhen lagi unhen swapn main teen murttiyaan, unke mandir or vishaal vaibhav dikhaai padaa or unke kaanon main yah aawaaj aayi - utho, meri seva kaa bhaar grahan karon
 i will expand my pastimes
 yah baat koun kah rahaa tha, koi dikhaai nahin padaa
 Gosain ji did not pay attention to it even once
 ant main shri hanuman ji maharaj ne is baar swayan unhen darshan diye or unhen puja karne kaa aadesh diya
 The next day, Gosainji Maharaj reached the idol, and he saw that the sound of bells and gongs was coming from all around, but nothing was seen
 iske baad shri gosaani ji ne aas-paas ke log ikatthe kiye or unhen sari baaten bataayi
 Together, they made a small Tiwari of Shri Maharaj and arranged for occasional bhoga offerings
 kai ek chamatkaar bhi shri maharaj ne dikhaaye, kintu yah badhati hui kala kuch vidharmiyon ke shashan-kaal main phir se lupt ho gayi
 Someone tried to dig up the idol of Shri Maharaj
 sainkadon haath khod lene par bhi jab murtti ke charnon kaa ant nahin aayaa to vah haar-maanakar chalaa gaya
 In fact, no other artist has built this idol separately, but it is part of the mountain and the whole mountain is as if its 'kanaka Bhudharakar' is darir
 isi murtti ke charnon main ek choti-si kundi thi, jiskaa jal kabhi bitta hi nahin tha
 The secret is that a fine water flows continuously from the bottom of the chest to the left of the Maharaj, which does not stop even if enough Chola is climbed
 is prakaar teenon devon kii sthapana hui
 In the vikrami-samvat 1979, Shri Maharaj changed his costume
 utaare hue chole ko gadiyon main bharkar shri ganga main pravaahit karne hetu bahut se shraddhalu chal diye
 When he reached the Mandavar railway station with the Chola, the railway authorities considered the Chola as a baggage and tried to weigh the Chola to collect the duty, but he was unable to weigh it
 chola taulne ke kram main vajan kabhi ek man bad jaataa to kabhi ek man ghat jaataa; antat: railway adhikari ne haar maan liya or chole ko sammaan sahit ganga ji ko samarpit kar diya gaya
 At that time there was destruction of Havan, Brahmin food and religious texts, and a new light emerged in the new garment, which spread light to every corner of India

 is prakriya ko kendrak-vibhaajan kehete hai
 In the second phase of division the cytoplasm is divided
 is prakriya ko koshika-dravya vibhaajan kehete hai
 At the end of division, the mother cell is converted into daughter-cell
 koshika ke prayek vibhaajan ke purv uske cendrak kaa vibhaajan hota he
 Centrifugal division is a method of occurrence that can be divided into several stages
 ye avasthaaen nimnlikhit hai : Precedence, madhyavastha, Postpartum and antyavastha In this, thin threads are seen inside the nucleus, which is called nucleus
 ye cendrakasutra kramash: sarpelikaran ke kaaran chote or mote ho jate hai
 By the time of middle age, they become many times smaller and thicker than their predecessor
 madhyavastha aane tak koshika ke bheetar kuch or mahatvapurn parivartan hote hai
 The nucleus cover is destroyed and a logical device is produced instead
 adhikansh praaniyon kii un koshikaon main, jinamein vibhaajan kii kshamta bani rahati he, ek vishesh upkaran hota he jis centrosom kehete hai or jiske madhya main ek kanika hoti hai, jise tarakendre kehete hai
 In the predecessor Tarakendra gets divided and one to two Tarakendras repel each other
 iske kaaran ye ek duusare se dur hote jate hai or centrosom do bhaagon main vibhajit ho jaataa he
 Both centrosomes are established at greater distances from each other
 prayek centrosom ke chaaron ore koshikadravya kii patali patali rekhaayen ban jaati hai, jinako tarakiran kehete hai
 Starlight arrives from both sides and strikes the center
 isak samay tak purvavastha apni parisamapti tak pahunch jati he or, jaisaa upar kaha ja chukaa he, centrekavaran nasht ho jaataa he
 Now there is a proliferation of cells from one centrosome to another
 centrosom or uski tarakiran ko centre kehete hai
 Tarku is made up of two types of logics
 ek to ve tantu hote hai jo ek centre se duusare centre tak faile hote hai or jinako satat tantu kehete hai
 The other are those fibers, with one end adjacent to the nucleus and the other with one of the two centers
 madhyavastha par cendrakasutra tarku kii madhyarekha ke samtal par ekatrit ho jate hai
 This plane is called the median phase
 madhyavastha main prayek cendrakasutra avibhajit hi prathit hota he parantu isamen andeh nahin ki is avasthaa ke bahut pehle se hi prayek cendrakasutra do bhaagon main vibhajit rahata he
 In fact, in the interstellar state before the action of division, each nucleus in the nucleus makes a second reflection similar to it, and these two formulas are so close to each other that the same are known in view
 prayek cendrakasutra main ek vishesh sthaan hota he jahaan tarku kaa cendrakasutreey tantu judaa hota he! isko sentonmir kehete hai
 In any animal, the nucleus is found only in the outer part of the medial pane, but in other animals both external and internal parts are found
 pashchaavastha main prayek cendrakasutra ke donon bhaag ek duusare se pruthak hone lagate hai or is avasthaa ke ant kaal tak abhimukhakendre tak pahunch jate hai
 After this, the intercession begins
 is avasthaa main cendrakasutron ke donon samoohon or kendron ke chaaron ore kendravaran utapann hote hai
 Thus two nuclei are produced from one nucleus
 koshika vibhaajan kii is avasthaa main koshikadravya ke vibhaajan se ek matra koshika se do santati koshikaon kaa nirmaan ho jaataa he
 The cytoplasm in animals is divided by the space in the plasma membrane and the phragmoplast in plants
 pranijivan tathaa praniprajnan ke hetu cendrak sutron kaa bada mahatv hai, kyonki ye anuvanshik padaarth se bane hote hai
 Nucleus are found in different numbers in the cells of different species of animals, but the number of nuclei is fixed for any one species and in normal state there is no variation in this number, as in every cell of human body
 There are 46 nucleus

 Cyber attack or cyber attack is a type of crime that is committed through computer
 ise angrezi bhashaa main cyberattack kehete hai
 Cyber attack is usually conducted by anonymous organizations or individuals to steal important data
 sibar aparaadh main sibar-aatankwaad bhi ek aparaadh hota he
 When a cyber attack between two sides, countries and institutions attacks each other, it is called cyber war

 prayojanavaad yaa falanumeyapramanyawad yaa vyavahaarwad angareji ke "pregametism" kaa samanarthvachi shabd he or pregametism shabd unani bhashaa ke 'pragma' shabd se bana he, jiskaa arth "kriya" yaa "karm" hota he
 Accordingly, "consequentialism" is an ideology that gives its functional influence or fruit a very important place in all fields of knowledge
 iske anusaar hamaari sabhi vastuvishyak dharanaayen unke sambhav vyaavhaarik parinaamon kii hi dharanaayen hoti hai
 Therefore, to get any thing or idea right, it is necessary to test its practical results
 prayojanavaad ek naveentam darshanik vichaardhaara he
 In the present era, this ideology is the most recognized among the various ideologies of philosophy and education
 yatharthwaad hi ek aisi vichaardhaara he jiskaa bijaropan maanav-mastishk main ati pracheen kaal main hi ho gaya tha
 Realism, rather than a name of a well-formed philosophical ideology, represents all ideas that believe that the object exists independently
 adarshavaadi yah maanata he ki ‘vastu’ kaa astitv hamaare gyaan par nirbhar karata he
 If this idea is correct then the object has no position
 iske thik vipareet yathartwaadee maanate hai ki vastu kaa swatantra astitv he chaahe vah hamaare vichaaron main ho athwa nahin
 Both the object and its related knowledge are separate entities
 sansar main anek aisi vastuein hai jinke sambandh main hamen jaankaree nahin he parantu iskaa arth yah nahin he ki ve astitv main he hi nahin
 This is to say that the object has an independent position
 hamaara gyaan hamako uski sthiti se avgat karaata he parantu uske bare main hamaara gyaan na hone se uskaa astitv nasht nahin ho jaataa
 In the same way, realistic about the means of acquiring knowledge, scientific method like Purposeism considers only the best method and takes shelter of incorporation method
 prayojanavaadee vichaardhaara kaa udbhav kab hua tha yah to nishchit rup se nahin kaha ja saktaa, kintu phir bhi is vichaardhaara kii vishistataa ko dhyaan main rakhte hue yah avashya hi kaha ja saktaa he ki jab se manushya ne apni samasyaon evam kathinaaiyon ke kaarnon evam unke samaadhaan ke liye kiye gayi prayaason se praapt anubhavon kii satyata evam vyaavhaarikta ke sambandh main chintan prarambh kiya tabhi se is vichaardhaara kaa bijaropan ho gaya tha
 Certain proponents of this theory relate it to the Greek thinker Protagoras's "man is the measure of all things" - and also to the ancient philosophers, such as Socrates and Aristotle, as users of the Pregomatic method; But in reality it is a modern ideology and its principal proponents are the famous psychologist of America, William James, educationist John Dewey and Dr

 John DV in America and Schiller in England were its main supporters and campaigners
 prayojanavaad athwa prayogwaad kaa janm america logon ke rahan- sahan tathaa vichaar prakriya ke falswaroop hua
 Because people fleeing Europe and England for religious freedom started believing in a peculiar functionality due to America's border-related freedom, so no ideology, other than for the hard-working beings to create new life, away from the digression of cultural values
 Was not suitable america jivan kaa yah ‘vaad’ pratibimb he
 This new philosophy was given full maturity by the greatest philanthropist, expert and propagator, the great philosopher, teacher and educationist John DV and therefore he is considered representative of Puritanism
 dow shiller ne maanviyatawad naamak siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya he jise vastav main falanumeyapramanyawad kii ek shakha hi samajhnaa chahie
 Almost all of James's works are based on this ideology
 james praaia: aadhyatmavaad ke, visheshtya hegely aadhyatmavaad ke, kattar virdohi the
 It would not be inappropriate to call him an ideological representative of the usable and outlandish American people
 jab vah satya ke ek aise maapdand ke vichaar main lage the jo aadhyatmavaadi maapdand se sarvatha bhinn ho, unhone janvari, san 1878 i
 ke "paupular science" naamak ek amareeki masikpatr main, charles peers likhit "ham apane vichaaron ko spasht kaise banaaen" - lekh padhaa or usamen adhanik falanumey pramanyawad kii moolbhoot ruparekha paakar unhen yah vishwaas ho gaya ki satya yaa satyagyan kii kasuti yahi he
 To Peers, as he himself has stated, both the term "pragmatism" and its expressions of consequentialism were met with the works of the famous philosopher Kant of Germany
 parantu is vichaardhaara kii pracheenta pradarshit karte hue bhi james ne apane ko vishesh rup se peers kaa hi abhaari mana he or unhen darshanajagat main aadhunik falanumeyapramanyawad kaa pravartak kahkar sammanit kiya he
 In any case, James himself is the most notable name in giving this theory strength and fame
 unke likhe hue "manovigyaan ke siddhant", "dharmik anubhav ke vividh rup", "falanumeyapramanyawad", "satya kaa arth" or "nanaatmak vishwa" aadi sabhi prakhyat granth is vichaardhaara kaa samarthan karte hai
 Not only his logical thoughts, but psychological and elemental - all kinds of ideas are clear symbols of the consequentialist tendency
 james ke anusaar "satya un sab baton kaa naam he jo vishwaas ke maarg main, tathaa nishchit nirdishtavy hetuon se bhi, apane aapako shreshth siddh karti hai"
 In short, "truth is only a worthy or appropriate tool of the thought process, just as" auspicious "is only a successful instrument of our practical life; it is somehow beneficial and, in fact, ultimately and all things Keeping in mind is beneficial
 " james satya ko hamaari nijee dharanaon kaa nakad mulya maanate hai, vastugat tathy nahin
 According to them, we create our own truths
 ve bahya vastuon kii pratikriya maatr nahin; kintu hamaare prayojanon ke sadhak hamaare hi vishwaas hote hai
 We tend to believe those beliefs that give us emotional fulfillment or practical success to be true, and vice versa as false
 at: hamaare vishwaason yaa vichaaron kaa satyatv unke fal yaa parinaam dwaara anumey hota he
 It takes time and experience to establish
 jaise jaise hamen kisi vishwaas se vyavhaar main safalataa milti jaati he vaise hi vaise uskaa satyatv bhi badhata jaataa he
 None of our beliefs, as evidenced by our limited experience, has the right to be called absolutely true, even the so-called natural laws of science cannot be called absolutely true
 hamen adhik se adhik yahi kehane kaa adhikaar he ki jahaan tak hamaare ab tak ke anubhavon kaa sabandh he, ve satya siddh hue hai; parantu isse unki shaashvat satyata pramanit nahin hoti
 a complete experience, which is never possible, is expected for complete truth
 at: maanav dwaara pratipaadit koi bhi satya, chaahe vah vaigyanik ho chaahe vah vaigyanik ho chaahe taarkik, purna satya nahin ho saktaa
 Those who often perceive the siddha-satya or principle, are considered to be only a sub-concept of the result
 ve buddhivaadee tarkshastra kii kadi aalochana karte hai or unke nyayavakya aadi siddhanton ko dooshit tehraate hai
 They always consider human ideas to be ideological, not selfless, against the beliefs of rational rationalists
 gyaan ke satyatvasatyatv ke pareekshan kii bhartiya nyaayadarshan kii "pravritisamarthy va pravritivisamvaad" naamak vidhi, jiske anusaar kaary main pravrutt hone par safalataa pradaayak gyaan ko yatharth tathaa vifaltaajanak gyaan ko ayatharth yaa mithyaa mana jaataa he, is falanumeyapramanyawaadee vidhi se milti julati maaloom hoti he
 But, at the same time, the staunch objectivist jurist saying "tadvati tatrakarak jnanam realam" and tadabhavati tatakarak jnanam illusion: "james" seems to be bitterly criticized by Western Western philanthropists
 jis prakaar satyasty vivechan main, usee prakaar maansik prakriyaaon yaa vichaaron kii vyakhya main bhi falanumeyapramanyawaadee hamaari prayojnatmak kriyaaon ko hi pramukh sthaan pradaan karte hai
 According to him, we produce not only our truths but also diverse experiences
 hamaara praathmik athwa, moolbhoot anubhav ek avichhinn dhara jaisaa hota he or ham swaprayojanon evam swaarthon se prerit hokar, vishleshan tathaa chunaav aadi karne kii apni maansik kriyaaon dwaara, uskaa vibhaajan, vibhinn padaarthon tathaa unke parsparik sambandhon ke rup main, kar liya karte he
 Thus, in his psychology and Locke's atomistic psychology, according to which our ideas are considered to be a mechanically stored sequence of initial simple suffixes, there is a fundamental difference
 falanumeyapramanyawaadiyon kii drushti main parmanuwaadi manovigyaan isi naam ke bhautik vigyaan kii nakal he jo vaastaviktaa se dur evam bhraamak he
 There is no scientific consensus among those who accept the consequent holistic method of testing the truthfulness of beliefs or ideas
 phir bhi, yadi kisi tatvagyan ko is vichaardhaara kaa praturup kaha ja saktaa he to vah he pro dyui dwaara samarthit dow shiller kaa "studies in humanism" naamak pustak main pratipaadit tathvik siddhant
 According to this, we always keep creating reality to a large extent and in the true sense, because every and every real thing depends on our knowledge related to it
 koi bhi gyaat padaarth aisa nahin hota jiskaa swaroop hamaare dwaara uske gyaat hone se, vishesh rup se, nirdhaarit evam nirmit na hota ho
 We do not know what altruism is, and nothing can be said about it, of course
 parantu jahaan tak gyaat vaastaviktaa kaa nirmaan karte rahete hai, kyonki prayek tathakthi yatharth vastu hamaare tatsambandhi gyaan par ashrith rahati he
 There is no known substance whose form is not determined and created by us, especially by its being known
 parmaarthiktaa kya he yah ham nahin jaanate or na uske vishay main, nishchay rup se, kuch kaha hi ja saktaa he
 But as far as known reality is concerned, it is decided that its form of creation depends, in a very important part, on our knowledge and on our knowledge on which our motives and interests are imprinted
 hamaare tathy ve hi hote hai jinamein unki nirmaapika main hamaari ichchhaaon ko trupt karne kii shakti yaa yogyata hoti he
 Just as truths are our successful beliefs, facts are the material that give satisfaction to our desires
 sankshep main hamaare vyaavhaarik jivan main safal kriyaatmak prabhavotpaadakta ko hi, in vichaarkon ke anusaar, tathyata yaa vaastaviktaa kaa lakshan samajhnaa chahie
 Indian Buddhist philosophy's definition of satta, according to which "satya is that which has the potential to produce an action", seems to be compatible with the consequentialist ideology, because it also contains the functions of the objects in determining their existence, existence, existence
 The fruit itself is considered to be decisive
 parantu tatvagyan sambandhi anek anya baton main sabhi buddha darshanik na to aapas main sahamat hai or na aadhunik falanumeyapramanyawaadiyon ke saath
 Purposeism, being a humanist philosophy, does not consider the world and its objects and actions as seriously as it does considering its usefulness in human life
 ek swatantra darshan ke rup main apane astitv kii raksha ke liye prayojanavaad ne maanav ko aadhaar banaate hue sansar evam uski kriyaaon ke kaarnon par vichaar karte hue nimnlikhit mul siddhanton kaa pratipaadan kiya he- Therefore, it is clear that the Purists sometimes support the idealists and sometimes the naturalists
 is prakaar ve apane ko in donon ‘vaado’ ke bich kii sthiti main rakhte hai
 Purposeful philosophy emerged as a movement of 'progress Movement Education' but today many apprehensions are being raised regarding its success
 kaaran spasht he ki prayojanavaad ne apane anishchit uddeshyon se, saadhan ko saadhy se adhik mahatv dekar tathaa manushya kii mulyon ke kshetra main rachanaatmakataa ityadi siddhanton kaa pratipaadan karke apurna vichaardhaara hone kaa parichay diya he
 Some points to consider in relation to Purposeful philosophy are as follows - komal shiksha pranali ke kaaran baalkon ko vaastavik jivan jeene ke liye taiyaar nahin kiya jaataa

 Relational Theory Introduction to Specific Relativity vishisht aapekshikta siddhant athwa aapekshikta kaa vishisht siddhant gatisheel vastuon main vaidyutsthitiki par apane shodh-patr main albert oinstin ne 1905 main prastaavit jadtviya nirdesh tantra main maapan kaa ek bhautik siddhant diya
 Galileo Galilei had recognized that all similar motions are relativistic and that nothing here is absolute and nothing is even at rest, which is now called Galileo's relative theory
 oinstin ne is siddhant ko vistaarit kiya, jiske anusaar prakaash kaa veg nirpeksh va niyat he, yah ek aisi ghatana he jo mikelson-morle ke prayog main haal hi main drushtigochar hui thi
 He also gave an epiphany that all these physical laws, all the laws of mechanics and electrodynamics, whatever they are, remain the same
 is siddhant ke parinaamon kii sankhya vrahat he jo praayogic rup se prekshit ho chuke hai, jaise- samay vistaaran, lambaai sankuchan or samakshanikta
 This theory has changed the concept of nocturnal time interval and has given rise to new concept like nocturnal time period
 is siddhant ne krantikari dravyaman-urja sambandh E=mc2 diya, jahaan c nirvaat main prakaash kaa veg he, yah sutara is siddhant ke do abhigruhiton sahit anya bhautik niyamon kaa sayukt rup se vyutpan he
 The predictions of relativity theory simply refer to the result of notable physics, especially when the velocity of an observable object is negligible compared to the velocity of light
 vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ke anusaar prakaash kaa veg c kisi pariklpana kaa veg maatr nahin he jaise vidyutchumbakeey vikiran kaa veg balki samshti va samay ke ekikaran kaa dik-kaal ke rup main karne ke liye ek moolbhoot lakshan he
 One consequence of this theory is that any object or particle whose break mass is not zero cannot be accelerated to the velocity of light under any circumstances
 is siddhant ko vishisht kehane kaa kaaran yah he ki yah siddhant keval jadtviya nirdesh tantron main hi lagu hota he
 a few years later, a comprehensive theory of general relativity was given, which works on broad coordinates and also helps in understanding gravity
 —albert oinstin : aatmakathaatmak tippaniyan Einstein made two basic propositions that seem to be the most correct, ignoring the absolute validity of the laws of the then mechanics and electrodynamics
 yah prastaav prakaash ke veg par nirbhar or bhautik niyamo va jadtviya nirdesh tantra se swatantra the
 He mentioned these identities in his first presentation in 1905
 vishisht aapekshikta kii vyutpatti na keval uparokt do abhigruhiton par he balki samshti kii samdaishikata va samarupata, chad maapan kii swatantraaa or apane ateet ke itihaas se ghadiyaan sahit vibhinn nihit pariklpanaaon par nirbhar karti he
 According to Einstein's original presentation on specific relativity in 1905, various postulates derived by different variable derivation methods have been given
 vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ke anusaar koi bhi nirdesh tantra nirpeksh nahin hoti
 The stationary instruction system on Earth is not an inertial direction system because it also rotates with the rotation speed of the Earth
 ek jadtviya nirdesh tantra ke saapeksh niyat veg se gatisheel nirdesh tantra bhi jadtviya hota he
 Hence the hypothesis of absolute inertial reference system is unfounded
 mana nirdesh tantra s main dik-kaal nirdeshaank hai or nirdesh tantra S′ main nirdeshaank hai
 Then according to Lorenz transformation these coordinates can be determined by the following relations: jahaan Lorenz is the multiplier and c is the velocity of light in vacuum and the velocity of the reference system s ′ is parallel to the v x-axis
 y or z nirdeshaank prabhavit nahin hai; keval x or t nirdeshaankon kaa sthaanantaran hota he
 There is nothing special in the x-axis, the transfer can also apply to the y or z axes, or in any direction that is parallel and perpendicular to the direction of motion
 ek raashi jo lorenj roopantaran main nishchar rahati he lorenj nishchar kehalaati he
 On writing Lorenz transform and its inverse in different coordinates, where one is the coordinates of one event and the other is coordinates of the event and then their intervals are defined as follows: atah ham likh sakate hai Results of specific relativities can be derived from Lorenz equations
 ye roopantaran or vishisht aapekshikta bhi, newtoneey parinaamon se bhinn parinaam dete hai jab saapeksh veg kaa maan prakaash ke veg kii koti kaa ho
 The velocity of light is much higher than any man-made conferences, which some effects were achieved by specific relativity
 samakshanikta, samay vistaaran, lambaai sankuchan jaise udhaaharan praayogic rup se siddh kiye ja chuke hai
 Two different phenomena that are similar in one inertial reference system may be not analogous to the observer located in the other inertial reference system
 bhinn nirdeshaankon main lorenj roopantaran kii pratham sameekaran Here it is clear that those instructions are symmetric in system S, not necessarily the other directive system in s ′
 yadi ye ghatnaayen nirdesh tantra s main samasthani hai, tab wo duusare nirdesh tantra S′ main bhi samakshanik hongi
 The time between any two events from one observer to another observer is not fixed, but depends on the speed of the observer
 mana kii ek ghadi nirdesh tantra s main viramavastha main he
 Two different tick-ticks of this clock can be represented by Δx = 0
 in donon tik ke madhya samay kaa maapan donon tantron main kiya jaataa he, iske liye pratham sameekaran nimna prakaar praapt hua : This shows that the time difference between the two ticks was higher in the instruction system in which the clock was in motion than in the instruction clock
 samay vistaaran kii sahaayta se ham kai bhautik pariklpanaaon ko samaj sakate hai jaise prithvi ke vayumandal main brahmand kirnon se janit muono kii kshay dar
 The measurement of the dimensions of an object by one observer may be different from the measurement observed by another observer
 isi prakaar, mana rekhak viramavastha main nirdesh tantra s main x-aksh kii taraf sanrekhit he
 In this system, the length of the linear is written as Δx
 rekhak kii lambaai kaa maapan S' nirdesh tantra main karne par jisamen ghadi gatisheel he jahaan chad ke chhoron par x′ kaa maapan S' tantra main samakshanik kiya jaataa he
 In other words, this measurement was done in Δt ′ = 0, which can be coupled by the fourth equation to establish the following relation in lengths Δx and Δx ′: isse spasht hota he ki nirdesh tantra jisamen chad gatisheel thi main chad kii lambaai kaa maan iske swayan ke viraam nirdesh tantra se kam he
 They are not simply added for the connection of velocities
 yadi nirdesh tantra s main prekshak ke anusaar koi vastu x aksh kii ore veg u se gatisheel he, to nirdesh tantra S′ jo nirdesh tantra s ke saapeksh x-aksh kii or v veg se gati kar rahi he main sthit prekshak dwaara prekshit gatisheel vastu kaa veg u' he jahaan : Other instructions observed in the system: yahan dhyaan dene yogya baat yah he ki vastuen jo nirdesh tantra s main prakaash ke veg se gatisheel hai tab vah vastu nirdesh tantra S′ main bhi prakaash ke vag se gatisheel hogi
 If the values of u and v are very low relative to the velocity of light, we get spontaneous galactic conversions of velocities
 saamaanya udahaaran jo diya jaataa he vah yah he ki ek train purv disha kii or patariyon ke saapeksh v veg se gati kar rahi he
 a child who is sitting inside a train threw a ball eastwards and with a velocity u relative to the train
 chirsmmat bhautikee main, patariyon par viramavastha main par sthit prekshak gend kaa veg kaa maan purv disha main u = u′ + v prekshit karegaa, jabaki vishisht aapekshikta yah satya nahin he; balki gend kaa veg purv disha main duusari sameekaran dwaara diya jaataa he : u = / 
 Again, there is nothing special for x or east direction
 ye sutara kisi bhi disha main lagu hogen jiske liye hamen saapeksh veg v ke paraspar samaantar va lambavat gatiyon kaa dhyaan rakhana hoga
 Einstein's law of combining velocities was found to be correct in the Fitzau experiment, which measured the velocity of light relative to a moving fluid parallel to the velocity of light
 lekin aaj tak kisi bhi prayog ne asamaantar gati ke vyapak rup ke liye sutara kaa parikshan nahin kiya
 Thomas precursor, also known as Thomas Rotation, is a relative refinement applied to the rotation of particles
 kisi vastu kaa abhivinyas vibhinn prekshkon ke liye bhinn ho saktaa he
 Unlike other relative effects, this effect is also meaningful at very low velocities, as can be seen in the movement of moving particles
 jaise-jaise kisi vastu kii chaal prekshak ke drushtikon se prakaas ke veg ke samakaksh pahunchati he, to iske aapekshik dravyaman bhi badhata he jisase iskaa twarit hona or adhik kathin ho jaataa he, yah sab prekshak ke nirdesh tantra se prathit hota he
 In the break state, the energy value of an object is mc2 where m is the mass of the object
 urja sarankshan ke niyam se kisi bhi kriya main dravyaman main kami kriya ke pashchaat isaki gatij urja main vruddhi ke tulya honi chahie
 Similarly, the mass of an object can be increased by taking its kinetic energy into it
 iske alaava uparokt ke sandarbh - lorenj roopantaran ko vyutpann karte hai or vishisht aapekshikta kii vyakhya - tulyata ke liye swa anubhavik tark dete hue ainstin ne bhi kam se kam chaar paper likhe
 The mass-energy equivalent is a consequence of specific relativity
 newtoneey yantriki main jahaan urja or samveg bhinn bhautik rashiyaan hai vishisht aapekshikta main ek chatursadish kaa nirmaan karte hai or yah samay ghatak ko samshti ghatak se sambandhit karata he
 An object located in the resting state is an energy mass quadrature: its time component is energy and the other three macro components are zero
 x-aksh disha main alp veg v ke saath lorenj roopantaran ke saath nirdesh tantra badalane par urja-samveg chatursadish hoga
 The value of momentum will be the same as the value obtained by dividing the product of energy and velocity by c2
 jaise kisi vastu kaa newtoneey dravyaman, jo nimna vegon ke liye samveg va veg ke anupaat ke saamaan hota he, e / c2 ke baraabar hoga
 Energy and momentum are the net property of matter and radiation, and it is impossible to conclude that they will be automatically obtained in quadrangular form from two fundamental identities of specific relativity, because they do not tell about matter or radiation, but rather about the macro and time
 Explains about atah isaki vyutpati ke liye adhik bhautik gyaan kii aavashyaktaa he
 For this, Einstein used the additional principle according to which the mechanics at low velocities yield perfect results, so at low velocities only the energy scalar and three-momentum vector are there
 isse aage unhone pariklpana di ki prakash kii urja or aavruti samaan dopler visthaapan ghatak se roopantarit hoga, jise usne maxwell samikarnon dwaara pehle hi satya siddh kar diya tha ainstin dwaara 1905 main prakashit pratham paper kaa vishay "kya kisi pind kaa jadtv us urja par nirbhar karata he?

 Although Einstein's argument in the paper is accepted by physicists as true almost universally without any proof, and many authors have suggested for the last few years that this is false
 anya lekhakon ke anusaar yah kathan kaaphi anirnaayak tha kyonki yah kuch antarnihit manyataon par aadhaarit tha
 Einstein admitted that his 1907 article on specific relativism disputed its derivatives
 vahaan unhone mahasoos kiya ki anumaanit urja-dravyaman tark ke liye maxwell samikarnon par bharosa karnaa samasyatmak he
 His paper published in 1905 argued that massless particles could be emitted, but according to the Maxwell equations, it undoubtedly made direct that emission of light could be achieved only as a result of work
 vidyutchumbakeey tarangon ke utsarjan ke liye, kisi aaweshit kan kii halchal hi prayaapt he or yah nishchit hi kaary he, atah yah urja kaa utsarjan he
 Since the speed of light is not possible, it can be concluded that humans cannot travel more than 40 light years away from the earth if the passenger is active from 20 to 60 years of age
 yah bhi saralata se sochaa ja saktaa he ki yatri kuch hi soramandalon tak pahunch paane main sakasham ho saktaa he jo prithvi se 20-40 prakaash varshon kii duuri par sthit hai
 But this is an incorrect result
 kyonki samay-vistaaran kii pariklpana ke anusaar payalat ke sakriya 40 varsh ke dauraan kaalpanik antarikshayan saikadon prakashavarsh yatra kar saktaa he
 If it is possible to build an spacecraft whose acceleration is 1g, then in less than a year, the speed of light will be observed at about the same speed of light from Earth
 samay vistaaran kii vajah se prithvi par sthit nirdesh tantra se prekshit uskaa jivan vistaar badhegaa, lekin uske saath yatra kar rahi ghadi main yah parivartan nahin hoga
 During his journey, the person on earth will experience more time than the traveler
 yatri dwaara prekshit 5 varsh bhraman yatra prithvi ke 61⁄2 varsh ke tulya hogi or 6 prakashavarsh duri tay karegaa
 If he returns to earth after a 20-year tour, he has spent 335 years on Earth and has traveled 331 light years
 1 g twaran ke saath 40 varsh kii yatra prithvi ke 58,000 varshon ke tulya hogi or 55,000 prakashavarsh duuri tay hogi
 a 40-year journey with 1
1 acceleration would be equivalent to 148,000 years of Earth and travel 140,000 light years
 isi vistaaran kaaran se ek muon jo prakaash ke veg c ke lagbhag saamaan veg se gatisheel hota he c×viraam arddh-aayu duuri se bahut aage bhi prekshit hota he
 In Figure 2, the interval AB is 'time-congruent'; Just as there is a directive mechanism in which two events a and b occur at the same point in the society, only when they occur at different times can be separated
 yadi is nirdesh tantra main ghatana A, ghatana B, se pehle ghatit hoti he to sabhi nirdesh tantron main ghatana A, b se pehle hi ghatit hogi
 It is possible for matter to move from one place to another, so a relationship is established here
 chitra main antaraal AC samshti-samroop arthath yahan ek nirdesh tantra aisa he jisamen ghatana a or c ek hi samay par ghatit hoti hai keval samshti alag-alag hota he
 Here, one can also find the instruction mechanisms in which a occurs before C, and the direction mechanisms in which c occurs before A
 yadi yah kaaran-or-prabhaav sambandh ke liye sambhav hota ki kuch ghatnaayen a or c ke bich ghatit ho jaayen tab kaaranta kaa virodhabhash iskaa parinaam hoga
 For example, if a was the cause and c is the effect, then there are some directive mechanisms in which the effect occurred before the cause
 yadhyapi yah apane aap main virodhabhash nahin he, isse pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he ki prakaash ke bhi veg se tej gati se swayan ke nirdesh tantra ke bhoot main bhej ja saktaa he
 The causal contradiction can be constructed by sending a signal if and only if no signal was previously found

 However, some objects move faster than the velocity of light, such as: Places where the rays of light strike the lower part of the cloud due to the lightning flashes, so that the beam can travel at a speed greater than the velocity of light when It turns quickly

 For example, if a fixed force is applied to an object for an infinite time, f = dp / dt is easily impeded by the integration of the following expression without limitation, but only because p = m γ v { \ 
 The displaystyle p = m \ gamma v \ ,} leads to infinity, as v { \ displaystyle \ , v}, proceeds to c

 This behavior is actually observed in particle accelerators, where each charged particle is accelerated by an electromagnetic force
 gunter nimtz or petrissaa ekcle dwaara pratipaadit saidhantik or praayogic surangan adhyayan ne galat daawa kiya kii vishesh paristhitiyon main signal prakaash ke veg se bhi adhik gati se chal saktaa he
 It is measured that the fiber digitizing signal speeds up to 5 times the velocity of c and the information that the electrons carry at zero time oscillation electrons and that the ionization of the atom from the photon and even then the electron imposes zero time in the tuning

 According to various scientists, not only are the interpretations of Nimtz incorrect but the experiment is actually a general experimental verification of the specific relativity principle
 vishisht aapekshikta main 4-vimiya minkovesaki samshti kaa upyog kiya jaataa he; - yah dik-kaal kaa udahaaran he
 Minkowski's time period appears to be very similar to the standard three-dimensional Euclidean macro, but it undergoes a radical change over time
 trivim samshti main avakal rekha alpaansh ds nimna prakaar se paribhaashit hota he Where dx = are the minor minor divisions in the three-dimensional macro

 Like the Euclidean society, Euclidean distance is also used, so the time period uses Minkowski's distance
 mul rup se vishisht aapekshikta ko "dik-kaal interval kii nishcharata" ke rup main dekha jaataa he jab ise "kisi jadtviya nirdesh tantra" main dekha jaataa he
 All equations and effects of specific relativity can be derived from Minkowski's time-rotation rotation symmetry
 uparokt "ds" kaa vaastavik rup doorik par or x0 nirdeshaank ke chunaav par nirbhar karata he
 To make the time coordinates similar to the macro coordinates, it is used as imaginary: x0 = ict

 Some authors use x0 = t where the multiplier of c is included elsewhere; For example, macro coordinates are divided by c, or multiples of c ± 2 are used in a distant surface
 yahan vibhinn prathaon ko praakrit ikai se pratisthapit kiya ja saktaa he jahaan c=1
 In this, the units of both time and macro are equivalent and the multiplier of c does not appear anywhere
 yadi ham samashti vimaa ko ek kam kar den, jisase ki bhautikee ko trivim main nirupit kar saken Then there will be a zero change in the direction of the duality cone, as the equation yaa Which is the equation of the circle with radius c dt

 When we study the stars and say "the light incident from this star that i am seeing now is so many years old", we see this point as a Vima: a null is geodesic
 ham is ghatana ko duuri d = x 1 2 + x 2 2 + x 3 2 { \ displaystyle d={ \ sqrt {x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2 xxrep 4 } par sthit va d / c samay purv ghatit ho chuki thi
 For this reason the null duality cone is also known as the 'light cone'
 shanku main -"t" kshetra kaa matlab bindu se soochna praapt kar rahaa he or shanku ke +"t" kshetra main bindu soochna bhej rahaa he
 Minkowski can illustrate the geometry of the macro by using Minkowski diagrams, which are also useful in understanding various experimental ideas in specific relativity
 vishisht aapekshikta kii samikarnon ko vyakt parivarti rup main likhaa ja saktaa he
 In the time period of an event, the situation is given by the reflex quadrature whose components are: ham x0 = ct paribhaashit karte hai taaki samay nirdeshaank kii vimaa bhi duuri ke samaan ho jaisaa ki anya dik-vimayein hai; atah dik va kaal samaan rup se sambandhit hai shirshank pratiparivarti suchakank ke liye upyog kiye hai naa ki unki ghaat ke liye or padank parivarti suchakank hai jo shunya se teen tak kii paraas main hai jaise ki adish kshetra φ kii chaturpravanta ko likhaa jaataa he : In inertial instruction systems, the coordinate transforms are given by the Lorenz transformation Λ

 The conversion of quadrature from one inertial instruction system to another is given by Lorenz transformation: yahan par μ' or ν' par 0 se 3 tak ke liye joda jaataa he
 The following are inverse transforms: jahaan λ μ ′ ν { \ displaystyle \ Lambda _{ \ mu '}{}^{ u }}, λ μ ′ ν { \ displaystyle \ Lambda ^{ \ mu '}{}_{ u }} kii vyutkram matrix kehalaati he
 In the case of Lorenz transformation, the above is taken in the direction of the x-axis: adhik vyapak rup main, adhiktar bhautik raashiyon ko pradeesh ke ghatakon ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, conversion from one instruction system to another, it is possible to follow comprehensive display conversion rules

 When the value of longitude dx2 is negative tab maanak samay kaa avkalaj he, jabaki dx2 dhanatmak he, maanak duri kaa avkalaj he
 The primary value of physical equations in adjective form lies in the Pioncare group, so we do not have to do specific and difficult calculations to calculate this effect

 The quadrature vector Uμ is given by the following equation iske pashchaat ham kan ke ek nirdesh tantra se duusare nirdesh tantra main chaturvegon ke roopantaran se sambandhit saral vaakya main vegon ke sangyojan par vichaar karte hai
 Uμ also has a definitive form: atah sabhi chaturveg sadish kaa parimaan c hota he
 This equation proves that the concept of permanent instruction in relativity disproves the hypothesis: because we are always in the forefront at least
 chaturtvaran sadish nimna sameekaran dwaara diya jaataa he : Subsequently, the above equation is calculated with respect to τ atah aapekshikta main, twaran chatursadish or veg chatursadish lamb koniya hote hai
 Emotion and energy are included in the covariant 4-vector: jahaan m nishchar dravyaman he
 The derivative value of the quadrangular vector derives the momentum – energy relation: yah nishchar kya he ham siddh kar sakate hai jiske liye hamen yah siddh karnaa hoga ki yah ek adish he, yah is par nirbhar nahin karata ki ham kis nirdesh tantra main gananaa kar rahe hai or nirdesh tantra ke roopantaran se hamen kul samveg shunaya praapt hota he
 It is clear here that the permanent mass is free and inert
 sthir dravyaman kii gananaa gatisheel kanon va nikaayon ke liye bhi kii jaati he, iske liye inkaa roopantaran us nirdesh tantra main kiya jaataa he jisamen inkaa samveg shunaya ho
 Static energy is related to mass and this well-known relation equation is mentioned above: yahan dhyaan rahe nikaay kaa dravyaman unke dravyaman kendra nirdesh tantra main kalit kiya jaataa he jo is nirdesh tantra main isaki kul urja dwaara diya jaataa he
 This should not be the same as the sum of the private body masses measured in other reference systems

 Where, it is necessary to have the stereoscopic forces defined above
 durbhagyavash, chaturvim main aisa koi pradeesh nahin he jo trivim bal sadish ke ghatakon ko apane ghatakon main samahit karata ho
 If the velocity of the particle is not c, then it is possible to transform the stereoscopic forces from the particle's concomitant direction system to the observer direction
 isse 4-sadish kaa nirmaan hota he jise chaturbal kaha jaataa he
 This is the rate of change in the energy momentum quadrature defined above relative to the above standard time
 chaturbal kaa covariant sanskaran: Where τ is called standard time

 In broad terms, though, the components of the quadratic are not the same as the components of the stereoscopic force because the stereoscopic forces are defined as the rate of change in momentum relative to the directive time which is dp / dt rather the standard force is the quadratic force
 Is defined as the rate of change in dp / dτ
