 In developing countries, needle safety still needs to be improved in hospital settings because most needle removal procedures are performed manually and allow for needles and infections that penetrate the skin under severe risk
 ye desh sui ke saath vyaktigat suraksha upkarnon ke saath sanlagn sui nahin kharid pate hai, to syringe se sui nikaalane ke liye sui-padchyut kaa istemaal kiya janaa chahie
 It reduces the pathogen spreading by reuse of syringes, accidental incidents with needles, sticks are less likely and may facilitate syringe disposal

 The disadvantage is to hinge systems that the cap can get caught by jewelry and clothing, can get bumped when used and the steady state can be a hindrance during low-angle injection
) So Becton, Deakinson
 haalanki, duniya ke baaki samaan sui or syringe viniyamon nahin he
 For example, the major concern is the reuse of contaminated needles and syringes, which are autodisable features only in developing countries to ensure that all immunizations are able to regulate vexation by syringes sent to these countries
 in suvidhaon autodiceble sirinjon ek baar hi istemaal kiya jayega, taaki ve pun: upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa anumati dete hai
 These mechanisms that prevent teeth interlock may prevent the bag being pulled back for another use or to prevent prefilled reuse with a vaccine

 BD Unincorporated is a prefilled vaccine syringe that uses a plastic one in place of the bulb and a disc to prevent reuse of the valve
 phir bhi, sirinjon ke 9 0 % se adhik duniya bhar main autodiceble visheshtaayen nahin he
 Personal protective devices are expensive and regular needles are more prevalent

 Needle-remover accidental needle-sticks because they allow less immediate removal and control of the needles, especially if the device is near the area of use
 sirinjon kaa punah prayog kyonki sui-padchyut shaareerik rup se syringe sui alag roka he, syringe bekaar bana
 They also improve waste disposal by decreasing the amount required for both infectious waste and waste safety boxes since security boxes can pack 2 0 -6 0% more firmly without syringes needles
 In addition, these devices can handle several hundred needles since a cost-efficient device
 kai vikasshil duniya ke deshon ke sansaadhan nahin he karne ke liye swat: niskriy sirinjon bardaasht karte hai, sui-padchyut ke saath aisa he, aspataalon main saste syringe kaa upyog jari rakh sakate hai, jabaki keval ek ek baar shulk kaa bhugtan karne ke liye ek sui-padchyut kiya he ki kharidne ke liye ek jivan 2 0 0 -5 0 0 ke bare main sui kii avadhi
 Whether the needle-remover will cause more harm than its potential benefit is an important ethical issue for the project

 Another concern is that children may gain access to equipment and accidentally hurt themselves

 The device will prevent needle reuse and facilitate needle collection and disposal and thereby improve the health and safety of hospital staff and the community

 In developing countries, the lack of proper needle collection devices leads to an increase in the number of sticks by HCW through commercial needle-contaminated needles

 This practice could potentially lead to needle-hcw and sticks by individuals in the community, as well as community members who may increase the possible spread of the disease by re-using the needle

 There are other patents that use the electric needle between the electrode or between the excursion gear to short circuit and melt it off the syringe

 Although in the development of the country, the source of electricity is not a reliable one, so hand-operated needle-cutters will be preferred
 In some designs one or two blades cross each other and therefore shear to use the force exerted by one hand
 vahaan anya dizin jisamen ek ghuma gati sui ke saath sampark main ek bal kaatna blade laata he or is prakaar yah main katautee kar rahe hai
 Another design is the internal cutting body with a stable external surface that rests against the syringe body and a cylindrical pass through the bore to a needle
 ek liver bhitari sharir he, jo ek container main syringe or udaseenta sui se sui kanchi bhraman karti hai
 a similar design can be used to power a crank system, which also uses a cylindrical inner body
 Instead of cutting needles, however, this tool completely pulls the syringe, which pulls the needle out of the needle and dumps it into a container
 ek or adhik jatil dizin vastav main syringe kii nalee se ek ghurni gati ke bina sui or collar: upkaran shaktiyon main syringe daal do hathiyaar band syringe sui khinchne ke liye kii gati neeche khinchati he

 a model circuit from Techno Fab uses a regular melt needle to reduce power, while another needle-remover, seen in kerrpathways

 a unique design needle-remover needle remover device, designed by this program for appropriate technology in health

 Another needle-remover currently on the market is Advanced Care Products and Store Clip, which uses a hand-operated clipper action needle

 There is also a BD hub cutter, which uses a hand pressurized cut syringe
 The edges of the squeezable parts are to make actual cuts of the blade
 haalanki, ek niyamit sui-padchyut ke vipareet, bidi hub kattar centre main syringe katautee to sui puri tarah se syringe se alag he
 As a result, the risk of a contaminated puncture is completely eliminated because no needle shards remain on the syringe
 hub kattar haalanki pun: prayojya nahin he or puri unit ke niptaan ghatit hoga
 Hub cutters cost about four dollars

 This form of operation can cause problems because if hospital personnel are busy, especially in a developing world country, they may not have the time or the necessary equipment to hand work
 ek parinaam ke rup main, sui syringe par khul rahete hai, prastut karenge donon ech si dablyoo or rogiyon ke liye ek jokhim
 In addition, many of these existing needle-remover use inexpensive and readily available materials, such as motor oil bowl containers, which raise the value of the device and require that the hospital continuously buys more containers from the company
 do not do
 Including a typical cost about shipping, $ 8 would have made a trip with the 3-gallon Bemis Sharps container without lid
 If these containers must be shipped overseas, the price of the equipment may far exceed the resources available in many hospitals in developing countries, which causes needle-remover not to purchase them
