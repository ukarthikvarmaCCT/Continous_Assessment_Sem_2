achchhaayiyon or trutiyon kaa sammishran, jaisaa vaastavik jivan main sarvatra dekhne ko miltaa he, us samay ke kathakaron kii kalpana ke pare kii baat thi
 For the first time in the novel, the possibility of real, vivid and deep study of human character was seen
 angreji ke mahan upanyaaskaar henry filding ne apni rachanaaon ko gadhy ke likhe gaye vyangyatmak mahakavy kii sangya di
 He compared the novel to history and called it relatively more important
 jahaan itihaas kuch vishisht vyaktiyon evam mahatvapurn ghatnaon tak hi simit rahata he, upanyaas pradarshit jivan ke satya, shaashvat or sanrvadeshiy mahatv rakhte hai
 In literature today, the novel has virtually the same place as the epics in the ancient era
 vyapak saamaajik chithran kii drushti se donon main paryaapt samya he
 But while the epics have an idealistic picture of life and individuals, the novel, as Filding's definition suggests, offers a critical interpretation of society
 upanyaaskaar ke liye kahani saadhan maatr he, saadhy nahin
 Its goal is not just to entertain the readers
 vah sachche arth main apane yug kaa itihaaskaar he jo satya or kalpana donon kaa sahaara lekar vyapak saamaajik jivan kii jhaanki prastut karata he
 Parallel to the novel, a novel prose called Novelika has been introduced which is also called a short novel
 upanyasika apni sanghatana kii drushti se upanyaas ke nikat hone par bhi kalver tathaa aakaar ke chalate kahani ke adhik nikat hoti he
 It neither has the same consistency as Kahani, the dense texture and influence, nor the novel like dispersion and representation variety
 dekha jaae to upanyasika upanyaas or kahani ke bich kii vidha he
 Kadambari of Banabhatta can be considered the world's first novel
 kuch log japani bhashaa main 1007 i
 main likhaa gaya “jenji kii kahani” naamak upanyaas ko duniya kaa sabase pehla upanyaas maanate hai
 It was written by a woman named Murasaki Shikibu
 isamen 54 adhyay or kareeb 1000 prishth hai
 It contains the story of a prince who went in search of love and conscience
 europe kaa pratham upanyaas servantis kaa “don quicksot” mana jaataa he jo spani bhashaa kaa upanyaas he
 It was written in 1605
 angreji kaa pratham upanyaas hone ke daavedaar kai hai
 Many scholars consider "the Pilgrims Progress" written by Joan Bunyan in 1678 to be the first English novel
 acharya ramachandra shukla ke anusaar pariksha guru hindi kaa pratham upanyaas he
 Its author is Lala Srinivasa Das
 'devra ni jethaani kii kahani' 
 Bhagyavati of Shraddharam Phillauri is also credited with being the first Hindi novel
 indulekha - rachanakaal, 1889, lekhak chandu menon Pratap Mudaliar - Creation period 1879, author, Mayuram Vedanayagam Pillai durgeshnandini - rachanakaal, 1865, lekhak, bankim chandra chatarji Yamuna Tourism - Creation period, 1857, author, Baba Padmaji
 ise bhartiya bhashaaon main likhaa gaya pratham upanyaas mana jaataa he
 In this way we can see that in almost all the languages of India, the novel mode originated at the same time in a span of ten-twenty years
 1077 gregory calendar kaa ek saadhaaran varsh he
 Economics is the branch of social science under which the production, distribution, exchange and consumption of goods and services are studied
 'arthshaastra' shabd sanskrit shabdon arth or shaastra kii sandhi se bana he, jiskaa shabdic arth he - 'dhan kaa adhyayan'
 The systematic knowledge of human actions in relation to a subject is called the scripture of that subject, so in economics it is necessary to have systematic knowledge of the work related to human beings
 arthshaastra kaa prayog yah samajhane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he ki arthvyavastha kis tarah se kaary karti he or samaaj main vibhinn virgon kaa aarthik sambandh kaisaa he
 Economical analysis is used in various fields related to society, such as: crime, education, family, health, law, politics, religion, social institutions and war etc
 pro
 samulson ke anusaar, The British economist Alfred Marshall defines the subject as 'a study of everyday life of mankind'
 marshall ne paaya tha ki samaaj main jo kuch bhi ghat rahaa he, uske peeche aarthik shaktiyaan hua karti hai
 That is why we need to understand its economic basis in order to understand the society and make it better
 leonnelle robinson ke anusaar aadhunik arthshaastra kii paribhaasha is prakaar he- Rarity means that the available resources are unable to meet all the demands and needs
 durlabhta or sansadhano ke vaikalpik upyogon ke kaaran hi arthshaastra kii praasangikta he
 Hence this topic studies options under the influence of motivators and resources
 arthshaastra main arthsambandhi baton kii pradhanta hona swaabhaavik he
 But we should not forget that the purpose of knowledge is not only to gain meaning, it is also to achieve welfare, happiness and peace for the world by searching for truth
 arthshaastra yah bhi batalaata he ki manushyon ke aarthik prayatnon dwaara vishwa main sukh or shanti kaise praapt ho sakati he
 Like all the scriptures, the aim of economics is also world welfare
 arthshaastra kaa drushtikon antarrashtriya he, yadhyapi usamen vyaktigat or rashtriya hiton kaa bhi vivechan rahata he
 It is possible that some people or nations become rich after studying this scripture and start exploiting other people or nations in the worry of becoming more rich, which disrupts the peace of the world
 parantu unke shoshan sambandhi ye sab kaary arthshaastra ke anuroop yaa uchit nahin kahe ja sakate, kyonki arthshaastra to unheen kaaryon kaa samarthan kar saktaa he, jiske dwaara vishwakalyaan kii vruddhi ho
 It is clear from this discussion that the simple definition of economics should be as follows - In economics, all the work related to the meaning of municipals is ordered in a systematic way
 uskaa dhyey vishwakalyaan he or uskaa drushtikon antarrashtriya he
 In which money related verbs are studied, it is called Arthashastra
 arthshaastra kii vishay-saamagree kaa sanket isaki paribhaasha se miltaa he
 Arthashatra is the science that studies the relationship between the natural alternative means of human use and their use
 arthshaastra kaa saiddhanthik evam vyavhaarik mahatv he
 The first book written on economics is Kautilya's Arthashastra
 arthshaastra bahut pracheen vidya he
 Four Upvedas were built in very ancient times
 in chaaron upavedon main arthved bhi ek upved mana jaataa he, parantu ab yah uplabdh nahin he
 Economics is also enumerated in the Vishnu Purana in the ancient and ancient 18 disciplines of India
 is samay barhospaty tathaa kautilia arthshaastra uplabdh hai
 Jupiter was the first Acharya of economics
 unka arthshaastra sutron ke rup main praapt he, parantu usamen arthshaastra sambandhi sab baton kaa samavesh nahin he
 Kautilya's Arthashastra is the only treatise available on the subject of Arthashastra, hence its importance is the highest
 acharya kautilya, chanakya ke naam se bhi prasiddh hai
 He was the general secretary of Chandragupta Maurya
 inkaa granth 'arthshaastra' panditon kii raay main praaia: 2,300 varsh purana he
 According to Acharya Kautilya, the field of economics is to think of ways to obtain and protect the Earth
 unhone apane arthshaastra main brahmacharya kii diksha se lekar deshon kii vijay karne kii anek baton kaa samavesh kiya he
 Acharya Kautilya discusses in detail the things of colonization of cities, management of detectives, creation of army, establishment of courts, marriage rules, rules, methods of climbing the sutras, fortifications, differences of treaties, architecture, etc
 pramant: is granth kii kitni hi baaten arthshaastra ke aadhunik kaal main nirdisht kshetra se baahar kii hai
 In it, topics like politics, criminology, sociology, ethics etc
 have also been considered
 bhartiya samskruti main chaar purushaarthon main arth bhi sammilit he
 Aparigraha is preached in Jainism
 anek pracheen sanskrit granthon main dhan kii prashansha yaa ninda kii gayi he
 Bhartrihari has said, 'survey multiplied Kanchanam Ashrayante'
 chanakyasutra main kaha he- Economics developed in its present form in western countries
 adam smith vartmaan arthshaastra ke janmdata maane jate hai
 You wrote a book called 'wealth of Nations'
 yah san 1776 i
 main prakashit hua
 In this, he has stated that the objective of economics of every country is to increase the wealth and power of that country
 unke baad malths, ricardo, mil, jevans, kaal marks, sithvik, marshall, vaakar, tasig ore robins ne arthshaastra sambandhi vishyon par sundar rachanaayen kin
 But Professor Marshall owes a certain amount to the economics, although Professor Robbins differs from Professor Marshall in the area of economics
 paashchaatya arthshaastriyon main arthshaastra ke kshetra ke sambandh main teen dal nishchit rup se dikhaai padate hai
 The first team is of Professor Robbins, who does not accept economics as a science, to consider such things in economics as a guide to economic reforms
 doosraa dal profesar marshall, profesar pigu ityadi kaa he, jo arthshaastra ko vigyaan maanate hue bhi yah sweekaar karata he ki arthshaastra ke adhyayan kaa mukhya vishay manushya he or uski aarthik unnati ke liye jin jin baton kii aavashyaktaa he, un sabakaa vichaar arthshaastra main kiya janaa aavashyak he
 But the economists of this party want to separate economics from politics
 teesraa dal karl marks ke samaan samaajwaadiyon kaa he, jo manushya ke shram ko hi utpati kaa saadhan maanata he or puunjipatiyon tathaa jameendaaron kaa naash karke mazdooron kii unnati chahta he
 He also wants the rule of workers
 teenon dalon main arthshaastra ke kshetra ke sambandh main bahut matbhed he
 Therefore it is necessary to consider this question: dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad america or soviet sangh main sheet yuddh chhid gaya
 This was not a war, but the world was divided into two parts
 sheet yuddh ke dauraan america, england, germany, austrailia, france, canada, spain ek taraf the
 All these countries were democratic and the policy of open economy was adopted here
 logon ko vyapaar karne kii khuli chhot thi
 There was an exemption for investing in the stock market
 in deshon main bahut sari bady-bady companiyaan baniin
 There was new research in these companies
 vishvavidhyalay, soochna praudyogiki, enginiyari udyog, bank aadi sabhi kshetron main jamkar tarakkee hui
 All these countries accepted the policy of promoting trade from other countries
 1945 ke baad se in sabhi deshon ne khub tarakkee kii
 On the other hand there were many more countries including Russia, China, Myanmar, East Germany, where the economic policy of socialism was adopted
 yahan par adhikansh udyogon par kadaa sarkari niyantran hota tha
 The government had the right over the profits from the industries
 saamanytah ye desh duusare loktantric deshon ke saath bahut kam vyapaar karte the
 Due to this kind of economic policy, there was not much competition in the industries here
 aam logon ko bhi laabh kamaane ke liye koi protsaahan nahin tha
 Due to these reasons, economic growth in these countries was very less
 3 oktober-1990 ko purv germany or pashchim germany kaa vilay hua
 United Germany, like progressive West Germany, adopted an open economy and democracy
 iske baad 1991 main soviet rus kaa vikhandan hua or rus sahit 15 deshon kaa janm hua
 Russia too adopted an open economy excluding socialism
 china ne samaajwaad ko puri tarah to nahin choda par 1970 ke ant se udaar nitiyon ko apanaaya or agle 3 varshon main bahut unnati kii
 Czechoslovakia was also a socialist country
 1-janvari-1993 ko iskaa check republic or slovakia main vikhandan hua
 These countries also abandoned socialism and adopted democracy and open economy
 mulya kii avadharana arthshaastra main kendriya he
 One way to measure this is the market price of the commodity
 adam smith ne shram ko mulya ke mukhya shrot ke rup main paribhaashit kiya
 The "labor theory of value" has been proposed by many economists, including Karl Marx
 is siddhanth ke anusaar kisi seva yaa vastu kaa mulya uske utpaadan main prayukt shram ke baraabar hot he
 Most people believe that its value determines the price of the commodity
 daam kaa yah shram siddhanth "mulya ke utpaadan laagat siddhanth" se nikatataa se judaa hua he
 Demand, interpretation and forecasting of the price and quantity of goods sold in a fully competitive market are done with the help of demand supply
 yah arthshaastra ke sabase mulbhoot prarupon main se ek he
 It is used extensively for the development of large theories and formats respectively
 maang, kisi niyat avadhi main kisi utpaada kii vah maatra he, jise niyat daam par upabhokta khareednaa chahta he or kharidne main sakasham he
 Demand is usually displayed in the form of a table or graph showing the relationship between price and desired quantity
 aapurti vastu kii vah maatra he jise niyat samay main diye gayi daam par utpaadak yaa vikreta bazaar main bechney ke liye taiyaar he
 Supplies are usually displayed in the form of a table or graph showing the relationship between price and quantity of supply
 pro robins ke anusaar arthshaastra vah vigyaan he jo manushya ke un kaaryon kaa adhyayan karata he jo icchit vastu or uske parimit sadhano ke rup main upasthit hote hai, jinka upyog vaikalpik yaa kam se kam do prakaar se kiya jaataa he
 The following things are clear from this definition of economics - manushya apni ichchhaaon kii tripti se sukh kaa anubhav karata he
 Therefore every human wants to satisfy his desires
 ichchhaaon kii tripti ke liye uske paas jo saadhan, dravya ityadi hai ve parimit hai
 No matter how rich a person is, the amount of his money must remain finite; Then he can use this finite instrument material in many ways
 isliye upyukt paribhaasha ke anusaar arthshaastra main manushyon ke un sab kaaryo ke sambandh main vichaar kiya jaataa he jo vah parimit sadhano dwaara apni ichchhaaon ko trupt karne ke liye karata he
 In this way, it becomes necessary to discuss all the functions related to its consumption in economics
 isi prakaar manushya ko bazaar main anek vastuen kis prakaar kharidne kaa saadhan dravya parimit rahata he
 Through this finite instrument, how he buys his essentials, which item he buys or sells at what rate, at what rate, that is, how he regulates, all these things are considered in economics
 manushya jab koi vastu taiyaar karata he, iske taiyaar karne ke saadhan parimit rahete hai or un sadhano kaa upyog vah kai tarah se kar saktaa he
 Therefore, it is natural to interpret all the work related to origins in economics
 manushya ko apane samay kaa upyog karne kii anek icchaayen hoti hai
 But time is always finite and can be used in many ways
 maan lijie, koi manushya so rahaa he, puja kar rahaa he yaa koi khel khel rahaa he
 According to Professor Rabin's definition, these works should be interpreted in economics, because the time spent in gold in worship or in sports could have been spent in any other work
 manushya koi bhi kaam kare, usamen samay kii aavashyaktaa avashya padati he or is parimit saadhan samay ke upyog kaa vivechan arthshaastra main avashya hona chahie
 Professor Robbins's definition of economics is so broad that according to it the interpretation of every work of human beings, whether it is religious, political or social, falls within economics
 is paribhaasha ko maan lene se arthshaastra, raajnneeti, dharamshastra or samajashaastra kii simaaon kaa spashtikaran baraabar nahin ho paata he
 The followers of Professor Robbins hold that according to finite means every aspect of human work has its economic aspect and this aspect is considered in economics
 ve kehete hai, yadi kisi kaary kaa sambandh rajya se ho to uskaa us pahalu se vichaar raajnneetishastra main kiya jaae or yadi us kaary kaa sambandh dharm se bhi ho to us pahalu se unka vichaar dharamshastra main kiya jaae
 Suppose a man is selling a commodity at a much higher price in Chorbazar
 saadhan parimit hone ke kaaran vah jo kaary kar rahaa he or uskaa prabhaav vastu kii utpati yaa purti par kya pad rahaa he, iskaa vichaar to arthshaastra main hoga; chorbazari karanevaale ke sambandh main rajya kaa kya kartavya he, iskaa vichaar raajnneetishastra yaa dandniti main hoga
 Whether this work is good or bad, it will be considered in sociology, ethics or theology
 or, yah kaise roka ja saktaa he, iskaa vichaar shaayad kisi bhi shaastra main na ho
 It is worth considering how far it is appropriate to consider any work from only one aspect
 profesar robins kii arthshaastra kii paribhaasha kii duusari dhyaan dene yogya baat yah he ki vah arthshaastra ko keval vigyaan kii maanata he
 It contains only the rules that explain the relation of work reason at any given time
 paristhitiyon main kis prakaar ke parivartan hone chahie or paristhitiyon ke badalane ke kya tareeke hai, in gambhir prashnon par usamen vichaar nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki ye sab kaary vigyaan ke baahar hai
 Suppose, at some point of time, the number of people drinking alcohol in a country is increasing
 professor robins kii paribhaasha ke anusaar arthshaastra main keval yahi vichaar kiya jayega ki sharaab pinevaalon kii sankhya badhane se sharaab kii keemat, sharaab paidaa karanevaalon or swayan sharaabiyon par kya asar padegaa
 But there is no scope in his economics to consider the question whether drinking alcohol is good or bad and how can the habit of drinking alcohol be stopped by the government
 unke arthshaastra main maargdarshan kaa abhaav he
 Guidance is considered to be an important part of every scripture and this part is lacking in Professor Rabin's definition of economics
 is kami ke kaaran arthshaastra kaa adhyayan janata ke liye laabhakaari nahin ho saktaa
 Socialists want that capitalists and landlords do not exist, the government should be laborers and the government should have complete control over the economic condition of the country
 ve apni arthshaastra sambandhi pustakon main in prashnon par bhi vichaar karte hai ki majdoor sarkaar kis prakaar sthapit honi chahie
 How to eradicate the existence of landlords and capitalists
 majdoor sarkaar kaa sagathan kis prakaar kaa ho or unka sanghathan sansarvyapee kis prakaar kiya ja saktaa he
 In this way, socialist writers make the field of economics so broad that many things of political science come into it
 hamako arthshaastra kaa kshetra is prakaar nirdhaarit karnaa chahie jisase usamen raajnneetishastra yaa anya kisi shaastra kii baton kaa samavesh na hone paae
 In relation to the field of economics, it is also necessary to consider Professor Marshall's definition of economics
 professor marshall ke matanusaar arthshaastra manushya ke jivan sambandhi saadhaaran kaaryon kaa adhyayan karata he
 He examines the personal and social functions of humans, which are closely related to acquiring and using physical means for their welfare
 professor marshall ne munashya ke kalyaan ko arthshaastra kii paribhaasha main sthaan dekar arthshaastra ke kshetra ko kuch badha diya he
 But even this economist did not give any thought in his book regarding the goal of economics
 vartmaan kaal main paashchaatya arthshaastriyon ne arthshaastra kaa kshetra to badha diya he, parantu aaj bhi ve arthshaastra ke dhyey ke sambandh main vichaar karnaa arthshaastra ke kshetra ke adanr sweekaar nahin karte
 Now economics is being given the form of art
 sansar main sarvatra aarthik yojanaon kii charchaa he
 Formulating an economic plan is an art
 bina dhyey ke koi yojana taiyaar hi nahin kii ja sakati
 There is no single objective of those who formulate these plans, because economics do not have any definite goal
 prayek yojana kaa ek alag hi dhyey maan liya jaataa he
 Now ways of improving the condition of countrymen are also considered in economics, but the ultimate goal of improving this condition has not been decided yet
 sarvamaanya dhyey ke abhaav main arthshaastriyon main matbhinnata itani bad gai he ki kisi vishay par do arthshaastriyon kaa ek mat kathinata se ho paata he
 This divergence has created a major hurdle in the study of economics
 is baadha ko dur karne ke liye paashchaatya arthshaastriyon ko apane granthon main arthshaastra ke dhyey ke sambandh main gambhirthapurvak vichaar karnaa chahie or jahaan tak sambhav ho, arthshaastra kaa ek sarvamaanya dhyey sheeghra nishchit kar lenaa chahie
 Everyone in the world wants to be happier and avoid sorrow
 vah jaanata he ki apni ichha jab trupt hoti he tab sukh praapt hota he or jab ichha kii purti nahin hoti tab du:kha kaa anubhav hota he
 Money helps in getting the desired item
 isliye prayek vyakti dhan praapt karne kaa praytn karata he
 He understands that happiness is achieved in the world only by money
 adhik se adhik sukh praapt karne ke liye vah adhik se adhik dhan praapt karne kaa praytn karata he
 In the worry of obtaining this wealth, he often does not consider how the money is being received
 iskaa parinaam yah hota he ki dhan aise sadhano dwaara bhi praapt kiya jaataa he jinase dusron kaa shoshan hota he, dusron ko dukh pahunchataa he
 In this way, many examples of obtaining wealth can be given
 poonjipati adhik dhan praapt karne kii chintaa main apane mazdooron ko uchit mazdooree nahin detaa
 This causes the condition of workers to deteriorate
 duukaandaar khaadya padaartho main milawat karke apane graahakon ke swasthya ko nasht karata he
 Many simple people are cheated by thieves, Mahajan ruins families of innumerable individuals by taking excessive interest from borrowers and excessive rent from landlord farmers
 prakruti kaa yah atal niyam he ki jo jaisaa bota he usko vaisaa hi kaatna padataa he
 Those who receive money by exploiting others or causing grief may forget this rule
 jo dhan dusron ko dukh pahunchaakar praapt hota he usase ant main du:kha hi miltaa he
 To expect happiness from him is futile
 yah satya he ki dusron ko dukh pahunchaakar jo dhan praapt kiya jaataa he usase icchit vastuen praapt kii ja sakati he or in vastuon ko praapt karne se sukh mil saktaa he
 But this happiness is temporary and eventually becomes a cause of sorrow
 sansar main aisi kai vastuen hai jinka upyog karne se tatkaal to sukh miltaa he, parantu dirghakaal main unase dukh kii prapti hoti he
 For example, there is immediate pleasure from the consumption of intoxicating substances, but when they become habitual, then their intake starts in excessive quantity, which has a bad effect on health
 isse ant main du:khee hona padataa he
 The wealth gained by harming others certainly increases bad habits and by giving temporary happiness for some time it becomes a means of increasing grief
 dusron ko dukh dekar praapt kiya hua dhan kabhi bhi sthaayee sukh or shanti kaa sadhak nahin ho saktaa
 There are two types of happiness
 kuch sukh to aise hai jo dusron ko dukh pahunchaakar praapt hote hai
 Examples of these have been given above
 kuch sukh aise hai jo dusron ko sukhi banaakar prapt hote hai
 They create peace in human mind
 apana kartavya paalan karne se jo sukh praapt hota he vah bhi shanti prad hota he kartavyapaalan karte samay jo shram karnaa padataa he usase kuch ksht avashya maaloom hota he, parantu kaary puraa hone par vah du:kha sukh main parinat ho jaataa he or usasen man main shanti utpann hoti he
 This kind of happiness is not a means of sorrow in future and this type of happiness is called bliss
 jab anand hi anand praapt hota he tab du:kha kaa lesh maatr bhi nahin rah jaataa
 Such a condition is called ecstasy
 paramanand praapt karnaa prayek vyakti kaa sarvottam dhyey he
 That is the peak of autism
 prayek manushya kaa kalyaan isi main he ki vah paramanand praapt karne kaa hameshaa praytn karata rahe
 He always enjoys happiness that does not become the cause or means of sorrow in future and he starts to experience peace and contentment
 jab ham apane prayatnon dwaara dusron ko sukh pahunchaate hai or unke kalyaan ke saadhan ban jate hai tab prakruti ke atal niyam ke anusaar inhen prayatnon dwaara hamaare kalyaan main bhi vruddhi hone lagati he
 The simple way to achieve autism is to become a means of welfare of others
 isi prakaar apane kaaryon dwaara kisi ko bhi du:kha na pahunchaana apane dukh se bachane kaa sabase saral tarika he
 Everyone should understand well that his true interest can only be proved by the benefit or charity of others
 isse yah spasht he ki dusron kaa sukh arthath vishwakalyaan hi apane sthaayee sukh or shanti arthath aatmakalyaan kaa ekmaatr saadhan he
 When every person will always try for the welfare of others for their welfare, then there will be no opposition to selfishness in any way, all kinds of conflict in the world will go away and everywhere happiness and peace will be permanently established
 aatmakalyaan ke liye yah aavashyak he ki prayek vyakti dusron ke swaarthon ko utana hi mahatv de jitna vah apane swaarth ko detaa he
 Just as he tries to increase his pleasures, similarly he should also try to increase the pleasures of others
 iskaa parinam yah hoga ki aise kaary band ho jaayenge jinke kaaran dusron ke du:khon kii vruddhi hoti he
 With this, there will be a continuous increase of happiness in the lives of the world and the welfare of the world will reach a growing climax
 bina vishwakalyaan ke kisi bhi vyakti kaa aatmakalyaan nahin ho saktaa
 True autism can only be achieved by world welfare
 aatmakalyaan hi prayek vyakti kaa sarvottam dhyey he or jab arthshaastra manushya ke aarthik prayatnon kaa adhyayan karata he tab uskaa dhyey bhi aatmakalyaan hi hona chahie
 But, as stated above, true autism can only be achieved by world welfare
 isliye arthshaastra kaa dhyey vishwakalyaan hi hona chahie
 We have already told that when a wish is not fulfilled, then one experiences sorrow
 isliye yadi kisi vastu kii ichha hi na kii jaae to du:kha praapt karne kaa avasar hi na praapt ho
 Some gentlemen are of the opinion that the lack of sorrow and permanent happiness and peace can be achieved by the retirement of all desires
 isliye is drushti se dekha jaae tab to sab ichchhaaon kaa abhaav hi arthshaastra kaa dhyey hona chahie
 It is fine that through practice one can control desires, but to achieve such condition when any kind of desire does not arise, it is not practical for one of the ordinary person
 astu, arthshaastra kaa dhyey sampurna ichchhaaon ke abhaav ko maan lene se thode se vyaktiyon kaa hi kalyaan ho sakegaa or janata kaa usase kuch bhi laabh na hoga, isliye is dhyey ko maan lenaa uchit na hoga
 Some people believe that human welfare is the goal of economics
 ve jeevajantuon tathaa pashupakshiyon ke hiton kaa dhyaan rakhana aavashyak nahin samajhate
 They probably believe that God created animals and animals and birds for human happiness only
 isliye unako du:kha pahunchaakar yaa vadh karke yadi manushyon kii ichchhaaon kii purti ho sakati ho to unako du:kha pahunchaane main kuch bhi aapatti nahin honi chahie
 But theology and Mahatma Gandhi are of the opinion that every person should do such a work that interests the 'universal interest' i
e
 all the living beings, so that no one is harmed
 jab manushya prayek jeevadharee ke hit ko apane nijee hit ke samaan maanane lagata he tabhi usko sthaayee sukh or shanti praapt hoti he
 Mahatma Gandhi has named this route 'sarvodaya'
 is sarvoday maarg dwaara hi sansar main prayek prakaar kaa sangharsh dur ho saktaa he, shoshan kaa ant ho saktaa he or vishwashanti sthapit ho sakati he
 The path of Sarvodaya is the best means to increase the welfare and welfare of every person
 isliye unke anusaar arthshaastra kaa dhyey maanavkalyaan na maanakar vishwakalyaan hi maananaa chahie
 In relation to the subject matter of economics, a description of economic activities is also necessary
 purv main utpaadan, upbhog, vinimay tathaa vitaran - arthshaastra ke ye chaar pradhan ang maane jate the
 In modern economics, these verbs can be divided into five parts
 aarthik kriyaaon ke uddeshy ke aadhaar par 1933 main sarvapratham reganar frrish ne arthshaastra ko do bhaagon main baanta
 International trade, foreign regulations, banking, etc
 are forms of macroeconomics
 sankshep main, adhyayan ke drushtikon se arthshaastra ke vibhinn angon ko ham is prakaar rakh sakate hai: It studies individual units, such as individuals, families, firms, industries, the value of a particular commodity
 boldig keanusaar, vyashti arthshaastra vishesh fermo, vishesh pariwaron, vaiyaktik keemton, mazdooriyon, aayon, vaiyaktik udyogon tathaa vishisht vastuon kaa adhyayan he
 It gives importance to marginal analysis
 aadhunik aarthik sinddhanth ke bahut se mahatvapurn vishay jaise antarrashtriya vyapaar, videshi vinimay, rajasav, baking, vyapaar chakra, rashtriya aay tathaa rojgaar ke siddhant, aarthik niyojan evam aarthik vikaas aadi kaa adhyayan iske antargat hota he
 In Bolding's words, macroeconomics is that part of economics that studies the large groups and averages of economics, not its special items
 vah in samoohon ko upyogi dhang se paribhaashit karne kaa praytn karata he tathaa inke parsparik sambandhon ko jaanchata he
 In short, it is part of economics

 niyamit vyanjak yaa regular oxpraishan computing main strings kii khoj yaa khojo-or-badalo ke liye sankshipt, lacheela or suvidhajanak tarika he
 For example, when searching for less, it will also search for the lotus and also the waist
 regular oxpraishan ko regex yaa regexp ke rup main sankshepit kiya jaataa he
 It is possible to use regular expressions in many programming languages, using it, a very big thing can be said or written in a single line, which makes the program small and legible
 jo programmer nahin hai unke liye yah 'find and riples' ke rup main iskaa bahut upyog he
 The following examples illustrate some features that can be expressed in regular expressions: regular oxpraishan in udaahranon se bhi adhik jatil ho sakate hai:regular oxpraishan ke prayog kai paath sampadakon dwaara upyogita evam bhashaaon kii programing main pattern par aadhaarit mul paath kii khoj or usamen manachaahe badlaav ke liye kiya gaye hai
 For example, Perl, Ruby and Tcl have strong regular expression engines built into their syntax
 Unix vitaranon ke dwaara pradutt anek upyogitaayen -- sampadak ed evam filter grep—regular oxpraishan kii avadharana ko lokapriy banane main sarvapratham the
 As an example of syntax, regular expressions \ bex can be used to search for all instances of the "ex" string that come after "word boundaries"
 alpagyon kii shabdaawalee main, \ bex apane se miltaa julata string "ex" ko do sambhavit kshetron main khoj legaa, shabdon ke aarambh main or ek string main do varnon ke bich main, jisamen se ek to shabd varna he or doosraa shabd varna nahin he
 Thus, "texts for experts" in the string corresponds with "ex" in \ bex "experts", but does not match in "texts"
 kai aadhunik computing pranaliyaan ek file system se filenems ke saath mail khilaane ke liye wildcard varna uplabdh karaati hai
 This is the intrinsic ability of many command-line shells, also known as globing
 wildcard aamtaur par regular oxpraishan se keval vikalpon ko simit rup main suchit karne ke maamle main bhinn he
 Regular expressions are useful in generating syntax that exposes systems, such as data validation and in the execution of many other functions
 regular oxpraishan khoj ingine ke liye upyogi hoga jaise Google, Bing yaa Yahoo! Search main to sampurna database se hokar guzarate hue processing karnaa jatilta or rijex kii dizin ko dekhte hue adhik computer sansaadhan kharch karnaa hoga
 Although in many cases system administrators can run regex-based internal queries, most search engines do not provide regex support to people
 One notable exception is Google Code Search
 regular oxpraishan, jise praayah pattern bhi kaha jaataa he, ek aisa suchak he jo strings ke ek set ke bare main vistaar se batalaata he
 They are usually used to summarize sets without creating a list of elements
 udhaaharan ke liye, 'set' jisamen teen strings hote hai "handel ", "händel " or "haendel " ko h ndel ke pattern ke rup main varnit kiya ja saktaa he 
 adhiktar akaarawadon main agar koi rijex kisi khaas set ke saath mail khaataa he to yah jaan lenaa chahie ki aise suchakon kii anant sankhya he
 Most formalisms form regular expressions for the following verbs
 |grey ke saath "gray " yaa "grey " mail khaataa he
 | gray and gry are identical patterns that describe both "gray" and "gray" sets
 udhaaharan ke liye, ab*c "ac ", "abc ", "abbc ", "abbbc " or isi prakaar se mail khaataa he
 These textures can be arbitrarily joined together to form complex indexes, just as one can construct arithmetic indicators from numbers and operations +, -, × and ÷
 udhaaharan ke liye, Hndel evam Hndel donon hi pramanik pattern hai, jo pichley udhaaharan kii hi tah samaan strings ke saath mail khaataa he, vah pichhlaa udhaaharan he Hndel
 The exact syntax for regular expressions varies with tools and context; More details are given in the "syntax" section

 Part of the design philosophy of Perl 6 is to improve the integration of Perl's regular expressions and to increase their scope and capabilities to allow the grammar of the phrase's terminology to be defined
 The result was a short language Perl 6 rule, which is used to define the Perl 6 grammar as well as to provide tools for programmers in the language

 The use of regular expressions in structured information standards for document and database modeling began in the 1960s and spread to the 1980s, when ISO SGML industry standards were consolidated
 At the heart of the structure's clarity in language standards is regular expressions

 Pattern Matching: See also History regular oxpraishan ko aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 Regular expressions have constants and operators, which respectively indicate the sets of strings that act upon these sets

 ek seemaabaddh varnmaala σ ko dekhte hue nimnlikhit sthiraankon kii paribhaasha di gai he: The following operations are defined: | α in r and β in s } ko sanketit karata he
 For example {"ab", "c"} {"d", "ef"} = {"abd", "abef", "cd", "cef"}
 | s jo r or s ke gathbandhan ko sanketit karata he
 For example {"ab", "c"} | {"ab", "d", "ef"} = {"ab", "c", "d", "ef"}

 For example, c can be written as abc and a |) as a | bc *

 Examples: |b* {ε, {0}a, b, bb, bbb,

 In this sense, regular expressions can denote well-organized language, precisely the category of language accepted by regular finite automata
 haalanki phir bhi susanhati main ek ullekhneey antar he
 Some categories of well-organized languages can be described by regular finite automata, whose size exponentially increases to the smallest regular expression
 bhashaaen hi yahaan maanak udhaaharan hai
 The Lk character {{0} a, b} whose last letter is equal to ka with all its strings
 ek ore, l 4 ko varnit karne vaale regular oxpraishan ∗ a { \ displaystyle ^{*}a} diya hua he
 This pattern gives the normalization indicator in Lk duusari ore, yah vidit he ki Lk bhashaa ko sweekaar karata hua niatatmak parimit autometon ke paas kai sthitiyon main kam se kam 2k ke hona jaruri he
 Fortunately, more common than regular expressions is simple mapping from non-finite to finite automata, which does not suddenly assume such a large explosive size; This is why nfas are often used as alternative representations of well-organized languages

 Finally, it is worth noting that many regular expression engines in the world apply features that cannot be described in terms of formal language theory by regular expression; See below for more information on this subject
 jaisaa ki udaahranon ko dekhne se pataa chalata he, vibhinn regular oxpraishan usee bhashaa ko abhivyakt kar sakate hai: ritivaad anaavashyak he
 It is possible to write in the algorithm between the given regular expressions to decide whether the mentioned languages are essentially the same
 This reduces each expression to the extent of the minimum deterministic finite state machine and determines whether they are homogeneous equivalents
 is anaavashyaktaa ko kis had tak nikaal diya ja saktaa he? kya ham regular oxpraishan kaa ek rochak subset khoj sakate hai jo puri tarah suchak ho? clin tara or set kaa gathbandhan spashtatah aavashyak he, lekin shaayad ham unke prayog par roak laga sakate hai
 This can turn into a surprisingly difficult problem

 paaramparik Unix regular oxpraishan vaakya-vinyas ne aam paripati kaa anusaran nahin kiya, lekin ek upkaran se duusare upkaran main aksar antar rahata tha
 The IEEE POSIX Basic Regular Expression Standard was designed specifically for inverse compatibility with traditional syntax, but it provided a common standard that has been adopted as the default syntax of many Unix regular expression devices, although It still often has some variations or additional features
 aise anek upkaran hai jo cmand line vishyon ke saath ERE vaakya-vinyas ko sahaara dete hai
 In the BRE syntax, most of the letters are taken in a literal sense - they match each other
 The exceptions listed below are called beyond characters or separated by sequences
 udhaaharan: Beyond letters means the opposite of syntax of POSIX extended regular expressions for some letters, avoiding the backslash
 is vaakya-vinyas main hi, ek bekaslash ke kaaran meta kairactor ko shabdic aksharon ke rup main mana jaataa he
 So for example, \ is now and \ { \ } is now {}
 Also, \ n has been omitted for previous references and is included beyond the following letters: udhaaharan: | dog corresponds with "cat" or "dog"
 POSIX vistaarit regular oxpraishan kaa prayog aksar aadhunik Unix prayojyata ke saath cmand line flag -E ko shaamil kar kiya ja saktaa he
 Since many categorized categories of characters are selected local settings, some of the POSIX standard letter categories or categories are shown in the following table: POSIX aksharon kii shreniyon kaa prayog keval koshthak suchakon ke andar hi ho saktaa he
 For example, ab] corresponds only to upper case capital letters and lowercase letters "a" and "b"

 An additional non-posix range understood by some devices is that typically defined by a plus underline underscore
 yah is tathy ko udbhasith karata he ki kai programing bhashaaon main ye hi ve akshar hai jinka prayog pahchaan chihn ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 Editor Vim further identifies the distinction between the Word and Word-head categories
 Since characters in many programming languages that can begin as an identification mark are not the same as those that may be present in other positions

 Because of its widely suggestive capabilities, many other usability and programming languages have adopted syntax like Perl - for example, Java, javascript, PCRE, Python, Ruby, Microsoft's

 pichhali anurupata pradaan karne ke uddeshy se ise anuchit samajha gaya he
 In standard expressions standard modifiers are greedy, meaning they match as many times as they can, leaving the rest to be a new match with the regex

 While this problem can be avoided in many ways, modern regular expression tools allow a quantizer to be characterized as sluggish, followed by a question mark after the quantizer, or by using modifiers that reverse the measureer's greed
 gives 
 Indicators first try to match the least, using the sluggish measure
 haalanki purvavarti udhaaharan main sust mail kaa prayog kai melon ke parinaamon main se kisi ek kaa chunaav karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, kuch maamalon main iskaa prayog behatar nishpaadan ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he, jab laalchee milan ko adhik peeche hatane kii jarurat padegi
 Patterns for Chaotic Languages many features derived from modern regular expression collections provide suggestive capabilities that exceed those of well-organized languages
 udhaaharan ke liye, kai karyanvayan up suchakon ke samoohikaran kii anumati pradaan karte hai or usee suchak main mail karaane kii keemat yaad dilaate hai
 This means that a pattern may correspond to repeated words, such as "papa" or "wikiwiki", which in formal language theory is called squares

 However, the language of squares is not well-organized

 Larry Wall, author of the Perl programming language, writes about the design of Perl 6 in an essay: kam se kam teen alag-alag kalam vidhiyaan kalanvidhi hai, jo nirdhaarit karti hai ki ek diya gaya regular oxpraishan kis prakaar ek string ke saath mail khata he
 Two formal language theories dependent on the oldest and fastest results that accepts the conversion of each non-deterministic finite position machine into a deterministic finite position machine
 DFA kaa spasht rup se nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he or tab iske parinamswaroop input par ek baar main ek pratik chinh par parichaalit hota he
 Creating a DFA for the size of a regular expression at the cost of "O" takes time and memory, but it can only run in o time on a string of n sizes
 ek vaikalpik prayaas NFA ko sidhe anukaran karnaa he, maang karne par anivaary rup se prayek DFA sthiti kaa nirmaan or tab agle kadam par sambhawatah caching ke saath ise baahar nikaal dena
 yah DFA ko antarnihit rakhata he or nirmaan kii ghaataank laagat se bachaa ja saktaa he, lekin chalan laagat o tak bad jaati he
 This explicit step is called the DFA algorithm and the underlying step is called the NFA algorithm
 As both can be seen in different ways in implementing the same DFA, they are also often called algorithms without discrimination
 ye kalan vidhiyaan tej hai lekin samoohikrut upasuchakon ko lautaane ke liye unka prayog sust parimann evam isi prakaar kii visheshtaayen pechida hai
 The third algorithm is to match the input string with the pattern via the back track
 is kalanvidhi ko aamtaur par NFA kaha jaataa he, lekin yah shabdaawalee aspasht he
 Its running time can be exponential, which its simple implementation reveals when matching against indicators such as * b which has both alternation and infinite quantification
 kalanvidhi par jor daalate hai ki sthanapann maamalon kii babbti hui ghaataanki sankhya par vichaar karen
 adhik jatil karyanvayan aksar chihnit or gatisheel karte hai yaa saadhaaran maamalon ko radd kar detii hai, jab unka chalan mand ho jaataa he
 Although back tracking implementations guarantee an exponential in the worst case scenario, they provide much greater flexibility and pointer power

 Some implementations provide two of the best algorithms by first running fast DFA to find out if the regular expressions are even slightly matching with the string, and only in this case possibly a dim back tracking match

 Om's mother, Bela Makhija, continues to encourage her son
 om ke dil kii dhadkan he-- desh kii sarvaadhik lokapriy film nayika, shantipriya 
 Omprakash gets two opportunities to approach Shantipriya
 pehla film 'drimigirl' ke premier par, jahaan om or pappu chaalaaki se ghus jate hai
 Another on the set of the film where Om saves Shanti from fire by playing on her life
 tab se om or shanti achche dost ban jate hai
 One day Om listens to the peace dispute with top producer Mukesh Mehra
 om ko yah jaanakar jhatka lagata he ki shanti mukesh se gupachup shaadi kar chuki he or garbhvatee he
 Mukesh is determined to keep his relations with Shanti a secret until his new film 'om Shanti Om' is completed
 shanti ko yah shaq he ki mukesh ek dhani vyavsaayee kii beti se vivaah kii yojana bana rahaa he
 She demands Mukesh his rights
 sab sunakar om kaa dil tut jaataa he
 One night, Mukesh takes Shanti to the set of the film 'om Shanti Om'
 vah kahata he ki vah film ko band kar degaa or saare samaaj ke saamne shanti se vivaah kar legaa
 But it turns out to be a trick of Mukesh
 vah shanti ko apni vittiya haani kaa kaaran samajhataa he
 So he sets the set on fire and leaves Shanti to die there
 om shanti ko bachaane kaa prayaas karata he par mukesh ke guard use aisa karne nahin dete

 Om Kapoor makes a plan together with Pappu, Bella and other companions to avenge Shanti's death
 om mukesh se tay karata he ki ve donon phir se 'om shanti om' film kaa nirmaan karenge
 Then Om and his assistant seek Shantipriya's lookalike
 unhen sandhyaa yaa 'sandy" naam kii yuvati milti he jo dekhne main shantipriya ke samaan or 'o ke' kii divaani he
 And then their plan begins - Om plays games with Mukesh
 sandy shanti ke rup main mukesh ke samane baar baar aati he
 Mukesh thinks that he is the soul of peace and starts to fear
 lekin phir ek din mukesh jaan jaataa he ki yah yuvati koi or he, shanti nahin
 He becomes alert
 ant main set par om or mukesh main hathapayee hoti he
 Om states that he was witness to the killing of Shanti by Mukesh in his previous birth
 mukesh use chunauti detaa he ki purvajanm kii baat par koi bhi adaalat vishwaas nahin karegi
 Just then, a young woman in the guise of peace comes there and says that just below the chandelier on the set, the proof of murder is buried - her body, which Mukesh had buried alive under the ground
 vah om ko mukesh par waar karne se roak detii he
 a heavy chandelier falls down and Mukesh gets subdued by it
 duusari ore se pappu ke saath sandy kamare main aa jaati he
 Om then realizes that Sandi, not the one who spoke the evidence, was the soul of the real Shantipriya, who avenged his killer

 shabd jelifish kaa upyog kai alag prakaar ke niderian ko nirupit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, jin sabamein chhatari ke samaan dikhne vaali ek buniyadi shaareerik sanrachana hoti he, jinamein shaamil hai scyphojoi, storosoi, hydrosoi or cubosoi jeev 
 Some textbooks and websites refer to scyphozoi as "real jellyfish"
 iske vyapak upyog main, kuch vaigyanik jab jelifish ko sanderbhit kar rahe hon, kabhi-kabhi sangh tinophora ke sadasyon ko shaamil karte hai
 Other scientists prefer to use the term "gelatinous zooplankton" when referring to them, with soft-bodied animals in the water column
 jelifish ke samooh ko kabhi-kabhi bloom yaa jhund bhi kaha jaataa he
 "bloom" is generally used for large groups of jellyfish that congregate in a small area, but may also include the time component, which is seasonal or greater than expected
 jelifish apane jivan-chakra ke swabhavanusaar "prasphutit" hote hai, jo dhoop or plankaton kii badhotaree par praayah apane nitalsth polip dwaara utpaadit hote hai, jisaki vajah se ve akasmaat prakat hote hai or aksar badi sankhya main, tab bhi jab paristhitiki tantra kaa santulan bana hua he

 The global increase in jellyfish eruption frequency can be caused by human impact
 kuch sthanon par jelifish paristhitik aalon ko bhar sakate hai jis par pehle ab adhik machhliimaar jeevon kaa kabja tha, lekin note kiya gaya he ki is pariklpana main samarthak data kii kami he
 Jellyfish researcher Marsha Youngbluth further clarifies that "jellyfish nourish the same types of young and adult fish, so if the fish is removed from the equation, the jellyfish is likely to take place
 " Some jellyfish populations, which have shown a clear increase over the past few decades, are of other "invasive" species coming from natural habitats: examples include the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, the Baltic Sea, the eastern Mediterranean beaches of Egypt and Israel, and Mexico
 American coast of the Gulf of
 Invasive species populations can expand rapidly as there are often no natural predators present in new habitats to prevent their growth
 zaruri nahin ki aise prasphuton adhik machhleemari yaa anya paryaavarniya samasyaon ko pratibimbit karen
 Increased nutrients, attributed to agricultural flow, have also been cited as the precursor to the jellyfish abundance

 pani jahaan swasthyapradposhan ho, aksar kam oxigen str main parinat hota he, jisase jelifish par anugrah hota he chunki ve machhlee kii tulana main kam oxigenyukt jal bardaasht kar sakate hai
 The fact that jellyfish are growing is a sign that something is happening in the ecosystem
 " a sample of ocean life off the coast of Namibia suggests that as a result of heavy fishing in the region over the past few decades, jellyfish biomass has overtaken fish
 jelifish dwaara gambhirtha se prabhavit kshetron main shaamil hai uttari mexico khadi, jiske bare main graham kehete hai "moon jeliyon ne ek prakaar kaa shleshiya jaal gathit kiya he jo khadi ke ek chor se duusare chor tak failaa he
 " jelifish prasphuton maanav jati ke liye samasyaayein paidaa karata he
 The most obvious are human stings and tourism declines on the beaches

 The barrier also creates a number of problems including shutting down nuclear power plants and desalination plants, as well as disrupting ship engines and overturning boats by the largest species, the Nomura jellyfish
 anek jelifish apane jivan chakra ke dauraan do alag jivan itihaas charnon se guzarate hai
 The first is the polypoid stage, when the animal takes the shape of a small stalk with nutritive tentacles; This polyp can be localized, living on a lower surface or similar substratum, such as fetters or the bottom of a boat, or it is attached to small pieces of free-floating or free-gv plankton or rarely, to fish or other invertebrates
 it happens
 aam taur par polip main anthosoai or saath hi sangh nideria ke nikat sambandhi laghu polipon ke samaan urdhvamukhi sparshakon se ghira mukh hota he
 Polyps can be solitary or phylogenetic and some proliferate in different ways asexually, producing multiple polyps
 kai bahut chote hote hai, jinhen millimitron main mapa jaataa he
 In the second stage, small polyps asexually produce jellyfish, each of which is known as medusa
 chote jelifish polip se dur tair kar jate hai or phir plavak par badhate or poshit hote hai
 The medusa has a spherically symmetrical, umbrella-shaped body called a bell, usually consisting of small tentacles, such as bordered tentacles, on the side of the bell that hold the prey
 jelifish kii kuch prajatiyon ke jivan chakra main polip bhaag nahin hota he, lekin ve jelifish se nishechit andon ke sidhe vikaas ke madhyam se jelifish kii agali peedi main jate hai
 Jellyfish are monogamous, meaning they are usually male or female
 zyaadaatar maamalon main, donon aas-paas ke pani main shukranu or andey jari karte hai, jahaan andey nishechit hote hai or nae jeev main paripakv hote hai
 In some species, sperm swim into the female's mouth to fertilize eggs within the female's body where they are present during the early stages of development
 moon jelly main, andey maukhik bahon ke gaddhon main basate hai, jo vikasshil planula larva ke liye ek asthaayee bacchon kaa kaksh banataa he
 After fertilization and early development, the insectoid form called the planula develops

 Only scyphozoans belonging to the Rhizostome class are captured for food; About 12 of the 85 species are collected and sold in international markets
 adhikansh ekatrikaran dakshinpurv asia main sampann hota he
 Rhizostomes, especially Ropilema esculentum in China and Stomolophus milligris in the United States, are preferred because of their larger and more rigid body and their toxin is not harmful to humans
 jelifish master dwaara sampann paaramparik prasanskaran vidhiyon main 20 se 40 din kaa bahu-charan prakriya shaamil he, jisamen janangranthiyaan or shleshmik jhilliyon ko nikaalane ke baad, chhatari or maukhik bahon ko namak or fitkaree ke mishran se sansaadhit, tathaa sampeedit kiya jaataa he
 Processing reduces fluidity, odor and deforming microorganisms and makes jellyfish dry and acidic, producing "crisp and crispy formation"

 In 1961, Osamu Shimomura of Princeton University, while studying the photoproteins that were the cause of the biopolarity by this species of jellyfish, extracted the green fluorescent protein from the large and abundant Hydromedusa equorea victoria and another bioremediated protein called equorin
 Three decades later, Douglas Prasher, a post-doctoral scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, sequenced and cloned the gene for GFP
 sheeghra hi colombia vishvavidhyalay ke martin chelfi ne pataa lagaaya ki kaise GFP ko anya koshikaon yaa angon main jin ke fluoroscent marker ke rup main sammilit kiya ja saktaa he
 Roger Sian of the University of California, San Diego later chemically manipulated GFP to acquire other fluorescence colors to be used as markers
 In 2008, Shimomura, Chalfi and Sian won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on GFP
 maanav nirmit GFP kaa ab saamanytah pradipt tag yah darshane ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he ki koun-si koshikaayen yaa utak vishisht jeenon ko vyakt karte hai
 Genetic engineering techniques combine the preferred genes with the GFP gene
 baad main sanyojit DNA ko koshika vanshakram yaa jin ko vahan karne vaale puure jantu ko utpaadit karne ke liye koshika main daal diya jaataa he
 In a cell or animal, the synthetic gene is generated in the same tissues as the normal gene and at the same time
 lekin saamaanya protein banane ke bajaay, jin GFP banaata he
 This can then be done by flashing light on the animal and observing the illumination to determine which tissues can express that protein - or at what stage of development
 Fluorescence refers to where the gene is expressed

 All jellyfish sting on their prey using nematocysts, a stinged structure located in specific cells called a nidocyte, which is characteristic of all neideria
 jelifish ke sparshakon ke saath sampark, lakhon nimatocist dwaara twachaa ko vedhane or vish inject karne ko prerit kar saktaa he, tathaapi keval kuch jelifish prajatiyon kaa dank maanvon main pratikul pratikriya utpann karata he
 When a nematocyst is induced by contact with a predator or prey, it quickly pressures up to 2,000 lbs / square inch until it explodes
 a lance inside the nematocyst pierces the skin of the prey and begins to poison the inside of the prey
 jelifish ko choona yaa uske dwaara chuaa janaa bahut hi asahaj ho saktaa he, kabhi-kabhi jiske liye chikitsa sahaayta kii aavashyaktaa hoti he; dank kaa prabhaav, bina koi prabhaav se lekar atyadhik dard or maut tak ho saktaa he
 Due to the wide variation in response to jellyfish stings, it is prudent not to come into contact with jellyfish from exposed skin
 yahaan tak ki samudratati or marane vaala jelifish bhi chhue jane par dank maar saktaa he
 Scyphozoi jellyfish stings are often inconvenient, although not generally fatal, but some species of class Cubozoa, such as the well-known and particularly virulent Irukandji, or box jellyfish can be fatal
 dank kii vajah se tivrograhita ho sakati he, jo maut kaa kaaran ban sakati he
 Therefore, the victims must immediately run out of water
 chikitsa dekharekh main vishrodhi khuraaq bhi shaamil he
 Three goals of first aid for non-complicated jellyfish stings are protection from injury to rescuers, neutralizing nematocysts, and removal of patient-associated tentacles
 Rescuers should wear restrictive clothing, such as panty hoods, wet suits or full-body sting-impermeable suits
 Inactivating nematocysts or sting cells and prevents toxin ingestion
 sirka se box jelifish dank main madad milti he, lekin portugali yoddha dankon se nahin
 For stings on or around the eyes, soak a towel in vinegar and dab it around the eyes, but avoid the eyes
 If vinegar is unavailable, salt water can also be used
 yadi namakeen pani main dank laga ho to tazaa pani kaa istemaal naa karen, kyonki tanaatmak parivartan atirikt vish chhod saktaa he
 Avoid rubbing the wound or using alcohol, spirits, ammonia, or urine that encourage the release of venom
 jagah se jelly, sparshak or nami saafe karne se, nimatocist uttejnaa or bhi kam ho jaati he
 Shaving the affected skin with a knife edge, razor or credit card can also remove the remaining nematocysts
 praathmik chikitsa-sahaayta ke alaava, difinhydermine jaise histaminarodhi twachaa kii jalan ko niyantrit kar sakate hai
 To remove the toxin in the skin, apply baking soda and water to the sting and cover it with a cloth
 If possible, apply the coat again every 15-20 minutes
 Up to the achievement of any one of these snow can prevent the poison from spreading

 gunasutra yaa chromosome sabhi vanaspatiyon va praaniyon kii koshikaon main paye jane vaale tantu rupi pind hote hai, jo ki sabhi anuvaanshik gunon ko nirdhaarit va sanchaarit karte hai
 The number of chromosomes in each species remains fixed
 maanav koshika main gunasutron kii sankhya 46 hoti he jo 23 ke jode main hote he
 Of these, 22 chromosomes are identical in male and female and homologous to their pairs
 inhen sammilit rup se samajaat gunasutra kehete he
 The chromosomes of the 23rd pair are not the same between men and women, which are called heterogeneous chromosomes
 gunasutra kii sanrachana main do padaarth visheshat: sanmilit rahete hai- DNA is the only genetic material
 di e na e anu kii sanrachana main chaar carbonic samaakshar sammilit hote hai : do purine, do pirimidine, ek chini-dioxyribose or phosforic amla 
 Purine contains adenine and guanine, and pyrimidine has thymine and cytosine
 di en e ke ek anu main do sutara hote hai, jo ek duusare ke chaaron or sarpil rup main valayit hote he
 Each DNA formula consists of one or more of the four organic cells in this sequence - thymine, cytosine, adenine, and guanine, and they are interconnected in a particular way
 in chaar samaakshaaron or unase sambandhit sharkara or phophoric amla anu kaa ek ekak tetraneucliotid hota he or kai sahastra tetraneucliotidon kaa ek di en e anu banataa he
 The reason for the variation of DNA of different beings is the difference in the sequence of cells
 di en e or aisa hi ek doosraa newcliik amla aar en e carbonic samaakshar kii upasthiti ke kaaran parabangnee ko adhikansh 2,600 angstrom ke kshetra main antarleen karte hai
 On this basis, a quantitative quantitative arrival of DNA is made
 praaniyon main do vishesh prakaar ke centresutra paae jate hai
 One is found in some dipterra insecta in the nuclei of the ovarian ligaments
 ye gunasutra usee jati ke saadhaaran gunasutron kii apeksha kai sau gune lambey or chaude hote hai
 For this reason, they are called Mahagunasutra
 inaki sanrachana saadhaaran samasutran or ardhasuthran centresutron se kuch bhinn dikhaai padati he
 Here, instead of one chromosome, a transverse line consists of granules that have more ability to stain
 gunasutra ke ek chor se duusare tak bahut si aisi anuprastha pankti kii sab kanikas ek samaan hoti hai or anya panktiyon kii kanikaon main visheshtaayen or vibhinnataayen hoti he
 As these chromosomes are very long, it is believed that they are completely desensitized and perhaps there is some elongation of the protein
 adhik chaude hone ke kaaran yah he ki ek gunasutra apane samaan ek duusare cendrak-tra kaa sanshleshan karata he
 At the time of samasutraana in ordinary state, these two sutras separate from each other, but in the Mahagunasutra it does not
 donon sutara ek duusare se jude hi rah jate hai
 The number of the Mahagunasutra is half that of the ordinary chromosome, as each sutra is paired with another sutra like it
 is ghatana ko daihik yugman kehete hai
 Another odd chromosome is also found in animals
 isak lampbrush gunasutra kehete hai
 These chromosomes are found in the nuclei of the eggs of animals that have high amounts of eggs, such as fish, amphibians, eggs, birds etc
 gunasutra saadhaaran diplotine-dyakinisis gunasutron ke samaan do do yugmit sutron ke bane hote hai
 Both paired sutras are connected to each other in some places and are far away from each other in other places
 in jodon ko kiesma samajha jaataa he
 On each sutra, which is called chromonima, there are granules of different lamination in place, which are called chromimiers
 prayek chromomier se ek jodi yaa adhik parshvapash jude hue hote he
 The lateral side is also made of a formula similar to chromonema, but the ribonucleo-protein corpuscles are gathered around it, making these formulas appear thick
 chromomier bhi chromonima se santat hote hai
 The nuclei are produced on a particular chromosome
 adhikansh jantuon kii prayek koshika main gunasutron ke do ekatm kulak hote hai
 a clan remains in the mature larynx
 aise praani or koshikaaye dwiganit kahi jaati hai, parantu kuch praaniyon, visheshat: paudhon, main do se adhik kulak gunasutron ke hote hai yah bahugunit kahe jate hai
 If the centrosome of a diploid animal is doubled, so that each of the sutras in its cells is like four, then such a creature is called an autopolyploid
 yadi kisi dwiguneet sankar ke gunasutra dugune ho jaae to aise praani ko allopoliploid kehete hai
 If a diploid animal, whose centrosomes are K1a1b1b1c1c1, etc
, is hybridized to another animal, whose chromosomes are K2a2b2b2c2c2, etc
, then its offspring will have chromosome A1a2b1b2c1c2 etc
 k1 k2 kha1 kha2 ityadi ek duusare se bhinn honge or inamen saadhaarant: yugman nahin hoga
 If the chromosomes of this creature are doubled, then in their cells A1a1a2a2; b 1 b 1 b 2 b 2; C1 c1 c2 c2, etc
 will have chromosomes
 yah allopoliploid kaha jayega
 Polyploids may also have more than four kulaks
 yah spasht he ki autopoliploid main zaigotin avasthaa main chatu:sanyojak utpann ho jaayange, kyonki prayek prakaar ke chaar chaar gunasutra upasthit hai or chaar sutron ke yugman se ek chatu:sanyojak banataa he
 At the time of cell division each pole will not get equal number of chromosomes
 praaia: aisa hota he ki ek chatu:sanyojak ke tuutane se kisi dhruv par teen sutara pahunche or uske sanmukh dhruv par ek hi sutara pahunche
 The offspring cells formed at the end of cell division will either have more chromosomes or fewer, and such imbalance results in the cell's death
 isi kaaran autotetraploid bahut kam urvar hote hai
 Autotetraploid plants are much larger than ordinary diploid plants and their seeds are also very large, so that they can prove more beneficial for the householder even when fertility is low
 thandhak pahunchaakar, yaa kuch alkelidon ke prabhaav se, paudhe atopoliplide banaae ja sakate hai
 The conditions are opposite in allotetraploids
 yadi donon aadim matapita ke sutara ek duusare se purna rup se vibhinn hon to allopoliplide kriyaatmak rup se dwiguneet he or purna rup se urvar hoga
 For example, if the formulas in a hybrid are completely different from those of K1a2, B1b2, C1c2, then such a hybrid will be sterile, but this state will be changed by doubling its chromosomes
 aisi koshikaon main k1 k1 k2 k2, kha1 kha1 kha2 kha2, ga1 ga1 ga2 ga2 ityadi sutara honge or jin shakhaon main aisi koshikaaye hongi unpar phool lagenge, kyonki aisi koshikaon main miotic vibhaajan safal hoga, k1 k1 se yugmit hoga, kha1 kha1 se ityadi
 The dhatura stramonium has 12 pairs of chromosomes in the diploid state and becomes bivalent at the time of meiosis
 iske autopoliploid main 12 chatushk gunasutra hote he or ardhasuthran ke samay 12 chatu:sanyojak banate hai
 Similarly, the plant diploid from Primula sinensis has 12 pairs of chromosomes and the autotetraploid has 48 formulas and at the time of meiosis it has 9 to 11 quadruple connectives and 2 to 6 are divalent
 solemon likopersicon ke dwiguneet main 12 jodi gunasutra hote hai or uske autotetraploid main 12 chatushk gunasutra
 These are all plants
 kripis rubra aura kripis foetida main 5 jodi gunasutra hote hai
 Their formulas do not differ much from each other and in hybrids resulting from their hybridization, 5 bisects are formed at the time of meiosis
 iske allopoliploid main 20 ken drakasutra hote hai or ardhasuthran main 0 se 5 chatu:sanyojak banate hai or 0 se 10 dwisanyojak
 It is clear that allotetraploids will not be very fertile
 primmula floribanda or primmula resticileta donon main hi 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai, jo ek duusare ke praaia: samaan hote hai
 The hybrids that they make from their hybridization are known as primateza kivensis
 isamen bhi 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai
 At the time of meiosis, the coupling is successful and 9 bisectors are formed
 sutron ke dvigun hone se jo allopoliplide banataa he usamen 9 chatushk sutara hote hai or aise paudhe main 12 se 18 tak dwisanyojak banate hai or 0 se 3 tak chatu:sanyojak
 It is clear that the number of quadrilateral is very small and sometimes not a single quadrant is formed
 muuli or karamkalla main se prayek main 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai, jo ek duusare se purnat: bhinn hote hai
 The hybrid Raphanus brassicae resulting from their hybridization also has 9 pair of chromosomes; But in meiosis, a single bisector is not formed, because the coupling action is not successful and all the formulas remain unpaired, making 12 unicellular
 iske sutara dvigun se utpann elotetraploid main 12 jodi sutara hote hai or ardhasuthran main 12 sanyojak banate hai, chatu:sanyojak ek bhi nahin
 The result is that raphanus-brassica-allatetraploid is very fertile, although raphanus-brassica-diploid is sterile

 anima : asht siddhiyon main sabase pehali siddhi anima hai, jiskaa arth! apane deh ko ek anu ke samaan sookshm karne kii shakti se hai
 Just as we cannot see a molecule with our naked eyes, in the same way, after achieving Anima Siddhi, no other person can see the one who attains Siddhi
 sadhak jab chaahe ek anu ke baraabar kaa sookshm deh dhaaran karne main sakasham hota hai
 2
 Glory: Glory is exactly the opposite of Anima's glory, whenever a seeker is able to make his body unlimited, he can expand his body to any extent

 garima : is siddhi ko praapt karne ke pashchaat sadhak apane sharir ke bhaar ko aseemit tareeke se badha saktaa hai
 The size of the seeker is limited, but the weight of his body increases so much that no power can move him
 4
 laghima : sadhak kaa sharir itnaa halkaa ho saktaa he ki vah pawan se bhi tej gati se ud saktaa hai
 The weight of his body becomes negligible
 5
 prapti : sadhak bina kisi roak-tok ke kisi bhi sthaan par, kahin bhi ja saktaa hai

 vishleshnatmak cubism ke rup main jaani jane vaali cubism kii pehali shakha ne france main 1907 se 1911 ke bich thode hi samay ke liye lekin kala andolan ke rup main kattar or prabhaavshaalee asar choda
 andolan apane duusare charan main synthetic cubism ke naam se badha or lagbhag 1919 tak mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa kii, jab tak ki atiyathartwaadee andolan ne lokapriyata nahin hasil kar lee
 The English art historian Douglas Cooper describes three stages of cubism in his seminal book, The Cubist Epic
 kupar ke anusaar "praarambhik cubism" tha jab shuruuaat main picasso or baraak ke studio main andolan viksit kiya gaya tha, duusare charan ko "ucch cubism" kaha jaataa he, jis dauraan juaan gris mahatvapurn pratipadak ke rup main ubhare or aakhir main kupar ne "antim cubism" ko kattarpanthi nav-vichaarak kala andolan kaa aakhri charan kaha
 In Cubist painting, objects are broken, analyzed, and re-created separately, rather than from a point of view, representing the artist in a larger context than many other perspectives
 aksar sataha yadrichhik konon par ek duusare ko katate prathit hote hai or gaharaai kii susangat samaj ko khatm kar dete hai
 The flat surface of the background and objects interact and create a shallow ambiguous space, which is one of the special features of Cubism
 angreji kala itihaaskaar, sangrahakartta or da cubist ipak ke lekhak duglas kupar ne paul gogyuin or paul sezen ke bare main kaha he ki "ye donon hi kalakaar cubism ke gathan ke vishesh rup se or 1906 se 1907 ke dauraan picasso ke chitron se prabhavit the"
 kupar kehete hai ki les demoicelis ko aksar galati se pehali cubist chitrakala ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 they tell, kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki cubism kii jadon ko sezen ke baad ke kaamon main do alag pravritiyon main paaya gaya: sabase pehle range hue sataha ko rangon ke chote bahupaksheeya kshetron main todane ke liye, baad main doorabeen drushtikon dwaara di gayi is mishrit drushti par jor dena or doosraa belanon, vritton ke prakritik roopon ke sarleekaran main ruchi ke jariye
 However, this concept was further explored by Cubist after Cézanne, who represented all the surfaces of the objects represented in the same picture, as if all the faces of the objects were visible at the same time
 This new style of illustration revolutionized the way objects were viewed in painting and art
 cubism ke avishkaar main paris ke montmari ke nivaasiyon picasso or baraak kaa sanyukt prayaas shaamil tha
 These artists were the principal inventors of the movement
 baad main spani juaan gris bhi is andolan main sakriy bhagidaar ke rup main jude
 1907 main milane ke baad baraak or picasso ne vishesh rup se cubism ke vikaas par kaam shuru kiya
 Picasso was initially the power and influence that persuaded Barack to break away from Fauvism by 1908
 donon kalakaaron ne 1908 ke aakhir or 1909 ke shuru se ek saath milakar kaam karnaa shuru kiya or 1914 main pratham vishwa yuddh chhidane tak saath kaam kiya
 The movement quickly spread to Paris and throughout Europe
 francisi kala sameekshak louis woxelus ne 1908 main baraak dwaara banaaye gaye ek chitra ko dekhne ke baad pehali baar "cubism" yaa "bijaare cubics" shabd kaa prayog kiya
 He described it as "filled with small cubes", which soon led to widespread use of the term, although it was not initially adopted by these two creators
 kala itihaaskaar ernest gombrich ne cubism ko "aspashtataa kaa safaya karne or tasviir ke, jo ek maanav nirmit nirmaan, ek ranga hua canvas hota he, ke ek paath ko bal dene- ke sarvaadhik moulik prayaas" ke rup main varnit kiya he
 Cubism was adopted by many artists in Montparnasse and encouraged by art trader Daniel Henry Conwiller, it became popular so quickly that a "cubic school" of artists was referred to by critics in 1911
 haalanki, apane ko cubist samajhane vaale anek kalakaar aisi dishaao main chale gaye jo baraak or picasso ke nirdeshon se kaaphi alag thim
 The Putoux group or section was an important branch of the d'or Cubist movement, including Guillaume Apollinaire, Robert Delaunay, Marcel Duchamp with his brothers Raymond duchamp-villon and Jacques Villon, and Fernad Lazar and Francis Picabio
 cubism ke saath jude anya mahatvapurn kalakaaron main dusron ke saath : albert gleizes jin metginger, meri lorencin, maiks webar, diego revera, meri vorobieff, lui mercousis, jin rij-rossau, roger di laa fresnaye, henry le faukanier, alexander archipenko, frantisek kupka, amidi ogenphant, jin marchand, leopold sarvej, patric henry bruce bhi shaamil hai
 Originally section d'or is another name for many artists associated with Cubism and Orphism
 purism cubism kii pratham vishwa yuddh ke baad viksit ek kalatmak shakha he, purism ke pramukh samarthakon main le corbusier, amidi ogenphant or fernand lager shaamil hai
 Cubism and modern European art arrived in the United States in 1913, when Jacques Villon displayed seven important and large dry points at New York City's famous Arsenal Show
 1920 se pehle baraak or picasso swayan kai mahatvapurn charnon se gujarey or inamen se kuch kaamon ko shastraagaar sho ke pehle neuyork main alfred stieglitz kii "291" gailaree main dekha ja chukaa tha
 The Czech artists, realizing the neoclassical importance of Picasso and Barak's Cubism, attempted to extract all branches of artistic creation — particularly painting and its components — for their personal work of architecture
 yah check cubism main viksit hua, jo cubism ke un check samarthakon kaa nav-vichaarak kala andolan tha jo 1910 se 1914 ke bich zyaadaatar praha main sakriy the
 Analytical Cubism was one of the two major branches of the artistic movement of Cubism and developed between 1908 and 1912
 synthetic cubism ke vipareet vishleshnatmak cubyston ne prakritik roopon kaa "vishleshan" kiya or in roopon ko do aiami chitra patal par buniyadi jyamitiya bhaagon main kam kiya
 In addition to a monochromatic scheme that often included blue, brown, and ocher colors, the use of color was almost non-existent
 vishleshnatmak cubist rang par jor dene ke bajaae prakritik vishwa kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye belan, vrutt or shanku jaise roopon par dhyaan kendrit kiya gaya
 There is a shared use of stylistic similarities in the works by Picasso and Barak during this movement
 pablo picasso or jorejis baraak donon udahaaran ke taur par apane chitron picasso ke maa joli, evam baraak ke da portuguese ke rup main chitra ke baahar kii vaastaviktaa or frem ke andar kii drishy bhashaa par jatil chintan ke bich ek tanaav kii aapurti karne ke liye vaastavik duniya ke liye paryaapt sanket chhodkar pruthakkaran kii ore chale gaye
 Shortly after the death of Paul Cézanne in Paris in 1907 there was a large museum retrospective exhibition of his works
 pradarshnee sezen ko ek mahatvapurn chitrakaar ke rup main sthapit karne main atyadhik prabhaavshaalee rahi jiske vichaar mukhyatah paris ke yuva kalakaaron ke liye vishesh rup se gunjyman rahe
 Both Picasso and Barak drew inspiration for Cubism from Paul Cézanne, who said that to observe and learn, look at nature and behave as if it were formed from basic shapes such as cubes, circles, cylinders, and cones
 picasso mukhya vishleshnatmak cubist the lekin baraak bhi pramukh the, jinhone cubist shabdkosh ko viksit karne main picasso ke saath kaam karne ke liye fovism kaa tyaag kar diya
 Synthetic Cubism was the second major movement within Cubism that was developed between 1912 and 1919 by Picasso, Barack and Juan Gris
 synthetic cubism ko bhinn sanrachanaon, satahon, coloz tatwon, paper kaale or kai mishrit vishyon kii ek vistrut bhinnata prastut karne kaa prarambh karne ke liye chitrit kiya jaataa he
 This was the beginning of the introduction of collage material as an important component in the work of art
 pablo picasso ke "steel life vid chair-canning ", ko is nai style kaa pehla kaam mana jaataa he, jisamen oil cloth shaamil he jise puri tasviir par rassi kii freming or vishay sahit, chair-canning jaisaa dikhne ke liye ek andakaar canvas par chapa gaya tha
 Above the left are the letters "JOU", which appear in many Cubist paintings and refer to the newspaper titled "le Journal"
 akhbaar kii kataranen ek aam samavesh thim, akhbaar ke bhautik tukade, shit sangeet or isi prakaar kii chijen coloz main shaamil the
 JOU can also be the French word JEU or Jouer lexicon at the same time
 picasso or baraak main ek duusare se ek dostana pratiyogita thi or kaaryon main aksharon ko shaamil karnaa unke khel kaa ek vistaar ho saktaa he
 While analytical cubism was an analysis of subjects, synthetic cubism is mostly about pushing multiple objects together
 vishleshnatmak cubism kii tulana main kam shuddh synthetic cubism main kam planar tabadili or kam chhayankan he jo samtal sthaan banaata he
 Cubist sculpture was developed in parallel by many artists of Cubist painting
 vibhinn strot pehali cubist murti ke taur par yaa to picasso kii 1909 kii pital kii head of a vuman kaa athwa kii murti yaa 1912 main praha main dikhaai gayi otto gatfreund kii anziti kaa naam lete hai
 Many other European sculptors were quick to follow his example, the Frenchman Raymond duchamp-villon, whose career ended in his death in military service, the Ukrainian Alexander Archipenko, whose 1912 Walking Woman who first applied a separate void And Lithuanian Jacques Lipchitz was one of the first painters identified as Cubist sculptor
 keval cubist chitra kii tarah, is style ne paul sezen ke ghatak samatalon or jyamitiya thoson, vrutt or shanku) main chitrit vastuon kii kami main apni jaden jamaa leen
 And as a mere painting, it paved its way in about 1925 and made a fundamental contribution to constructivism and futurism and became a widespread influence
 gartrud sten ke likhit kaaryon main maarg or puure adhyyon donon main imaarat ke blokon ke rup main aavriti or aavrityaatmak vaakyanshon kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 This technique has been used in most of Stan's important works, including the novel The Making of Americans, he was not only the first important patron of Cubism, Gertrude Stein and his brother Leo were also important influences on Cubism
 kram main sten ke lekhan par picasso kaa ek mahatvapurn prabhaav tha

 Poets commonly associated with Cubism include Guillaume Apollinaire Bless Senders Jean Cocto Max Jacob Andre Salmon and Pierre Reverdi
 america kavi kenneth rexroth ke vivaran ke anusaar kavita main cubism "ek jaagruk, savichaar viyojan or kathor vaastukala kii hadabandi main swayan sampoorn tatwon ke punarsangyojan se bani ek nai kalatmak ikai he
 It is quite different from the free union of surrealists and a combination of subliminal expression and Dada's political nihilism
 " baharhaal, cubist kaviyon kaa prabhaav cubism or baad ke dada or atiyatharthwaad ke andolanon donon par he; yatharthwaad ke sansthaapak sadsy lui aragon ne breton, supalt, aluard or apane liye kaha tha, reverdi hamaare "tatkaaleen varisht, anukaraniya kavi hai
 "although they are not as well remembered as Cubist painters, these poets continue to influence and inspire the American poet John Ashbery and Ron Padgett has recently made new translations of Reverdy's works
 voles steevence kii "thartin veg of looking at a blackbird" ke bare main bhi kaha jaataa he ki yah darshaati he ki cubism ke ekaadhik drushtikonon kaa kavita main kaise anuwaad kiya ja saktaa he
 The composer Edgard Vares was strongly influenced by Cubist art and writing
 ek kala andolan se bahut dur kala ke itihaas ke purv vrutanton tak simit cubism or isaki parampara ne anek samakaleen kalakaaron ke kaam kii jaankaree dena jari rakhaa he
 Cubist painting is not just a regular commercial use, but a significant number of contemporary artists have continued to draw stylistically and, perhaps more importantly, theoretically even today
 uttararddh main cubism ke prati kalakaaron ke liye sthaayee aakarshan ke kaaran ke suraag shaamil hai
 With photography's ever-increasing importance as a viable way of drawing portraits, Cubism as a representational cult of painting inevitably moves from representational painting to mechanistic photography and to a completely static audience
 Let's try to go beyond the limits of the traditional single point perspective
