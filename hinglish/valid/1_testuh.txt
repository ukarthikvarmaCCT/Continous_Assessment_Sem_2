 Indian cinema turned 100 years old on 3 May 2013
 kisi bhi desh main banane vaali filmein vahaan ke saamaajik jivan or reeti-rivaaj kaa darpan hoti hai
 In the history of 100 years of Indian cinema, we can see the different phases of Indian society
 ullekhneey he ki isi tithi ko bharat kii pehali feechar film “raja harishchandra” kaa rupahale parade par padaarpan hua tha
 The producer of this film was Dadasaheb Phalke, the father of Indian cinema
 ek sau varshon kii lambi yatra main hindi cinema ne na keval beshumaar kala pratibhaaen deen balki bhartiya samaaj or charitra ko gadhane main bhi mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 Dadasaheb Phalke saw a film based on the life of Jesus Christ during his stay in London
 us film ko dekh kar dada sahib phalke ke man main puranic kathaon par aadhaarit chalchitron ke nirmaan karne kii prabal ichha jaagrit hui
 After coming home, he made Raja Harishchandra which was India's first long film and released on 03 May 1913
 dhvanirahit hone ke baavjood bhi us chalchitr ne logon kaa bharpoor manoranjan kiya or darshakon ne uski khub prashansa kii
 Then movie production took the form of an industry in India and it started developing rapidly

 He returned home with his wife Devika Rani and started making films in his country
 unki patni devika rani swayan unki filmon main nayika hua karti thi
 Both the husband and wife got a lot of success and together they established the Bombay Talkies Studio
 apane udgam se lekar aaj tak bhartiya cinema main itane zyada badlaav aaye hai ki koi bhi ab ye nahin kah saktaa ki aaj ke daur main banane vaali filmein usee bhartiya cinema kaa ang hai jo hameshaa bhartiya samaaj main chetana ko jaagrath karne kaa kaary karata aayaa he
 It is said that cinema is the most powerful medium to show the right path to any society, because cinema is a mixed form of both visual and audio and it directly affects the heart of man

 He was a veteran actor of the stage, an amateur magician
 kala bhawan baroda se photography kaa ek paathyakram bhi kiya tha
 He also experimented in the process of photo chemical printing
 printing ke jis kaarobaar main vah lage hue the, 1910 main unke ek saajhedaar ne usase apana aarthik sahyog waapas le liya
 At that time, at the age of 40, his nature became irritable due to the loss in business
 unhone christmas ke avasar par ‘isamsih’ par bani ek film dekhi
 While watching the film, Phalke decided that the purpose of his life was to become a filmmaker
 unhen laga ki ramayana or mahabharat jaise puranic mahakavyon se filmon ke liye acchhee kahaniyaan milengi
 He had all kinds of skills
 vah nae-nae prayog karte the
 Therefore, by taking advantage of training and due to his temperamental nature, he became the first person to do the impossible task of making the first Indian film
 unhone 5 pound main ek sasta camera kharida or shahar ke sabhi cinemagharon main jaakar filmon kaa adhyayan or vishleshan kiya
 Then it took 20 hours a day to experiment
 aise unmaad se kaam karne kaa prabhaav unki sehat par padaa
 One of his eyes kept going

 He pledged his jewelry, challenging social eviction and social anger

 So to prove their efficiency, they sowed peas in a vessel

 For this, he used techniques of timeaps photography
 is tarah se bani apni patni kii jivan beemaa policy girvee rakhkar, oonchi byaaj dar par rin praapt karne main vah safal rahe
 In February 1912, he went to England to do a crash-course in film production and learned to work under Cecil Hepworth for a week
 cabaurn ne williamson camera, ek film paraforator, processing or printing mashin jaise yantron tathaa kaccha maal kaa chunaav karne main madad kii
 He made 'raja Harishchandra'
 chunki us daur main unke saamne koi or maanak nahin the, atah sab kaamchalaoo vyavastha unhen swayan kerani padi

 It was released on 21 April 1913 at the Olympia Cinema Hall
 pashchimi film ke nakchadhe darshakon ne hi nahin, balki press ne bhi isaki upeksha kii
 But Phalke knew that he was making his film for the general public, so this film was a tremendous hit
 phalke ke filmanirmiti ke prayaas tathaa pehali film raja harishchandra ke nirmaan par marathi main ek fichar film 'harishchandrachi factory' 2009 main bani, jise desh videsh main saraahaa gaya
 Silent films dominated the Indian cinema from 1913 to 1929, but around 1930, with the development of the technique of incorporating sound into movies, more films began to be made

 jane maane film nirmaataa shyaam benegal ne ‘bhashaa’ se kaha, ‘‘bhartiya cinema kii shuruyaat baatcheet ke madhyam se nahin balki gaanon ke madhyam se hui
 This is the reason why even today, films without songs are considered incomplete

 The film Karma released in 1933 became so popular that people started addressing the film's heroine Devika Rani as a film star and she became the first female film star in India
 mook filmon ke jamaane tak mumbai desh main chalchitr nirmaan kaa kendra bana rahaa parantu savak filmon kaa nirmaan shuru ho jane se or hamaare desh main vibhinn bhashaaon kaa chalan hone ke kaaran chennai main dakshin bhartiya bhashaaon vaali chalchitron kaa nirmaan hone laga
 In this way India's film industry was divided into two parts
 un dinon prabhaat, bambe takies or new theatres bharat ke pramukh studio the or ye praayah gambhir kintu manoranjak filmein bana kar darshakon kaa manoranjan kiya karti thim
 These three studios were called the big banners of the country

 Some of the well-known and popular films of that time are - v Shantaram's film "duniya Na Mane", Franz Osten's film "achchut Kanya", Damle and Fatehlal's film "sant Tukaram", Mehboob Khan's films "watan", "same" Rasta "and" Aurat ", Ardeshir Irani's film" Kisan Kanya "etc

 Initially, the studio system was in vogue
 harek studio ke apane vetanbhogi nirmaataa, nirdeshak, sangeetkaar, nayak, nayika tathaa anya kalakaar hua karte the
 But later people interested in film production started making films as independent producers

 As there was more income in contract work, the artists almost stopped working with salary

 The past actor Manoj Kumar said that the decade of 40s and 50s was brilliant in Hindi cinema

 Among such films, Badnaam Basti, Aashad Ka Din, Suraj's seventh horse, Ek Tha chander-ek Thi Sudha, Sattaise Down, Rajnigandha, Sara Akash, Nadia Par etc
 are prominent

 Films like "devdas, Bandini, Sujata and Parakh" were not considered as successful at the box office at that time, they are considered as the originators of the new era of Indian history of films

 Ramesh Sippy's 1975 film 'sholay' gave a new direction to Hindi filmmaking

 In the fifties, Dilip Kumar became popular as the Tragedy King
 didaar or devdas jaisi filmo main dukhad bhoomikaaon ke mashhoor hone ke kaaran unhe tregidi king kaha gaya
 He played the role of Mughal prince Jahangir in mughal-e-azam
 yah film pehle shwet or shyaam thi or 2004 main rangeen banaai gai
 He also produced the ganga-jamuna film in 1961, in which his younger brother Nasir Khan worked with him
 1970, 1980 or 1990 ke dashak main unhone kam filmo main kaam kiya
 His major films of this time were: Vidhata, Duniya, Karma, Izzatdar and Saudagar
 1998 main bani film kila unki aakhri film thi
 Popular actors of the sixties include Shashi Kapoor, Casto Mukherjee, Dharmendra, Jitendra, Rajesh Khanna, Sanjeev Kumar, Firoz Khan, Sanjay Khan, Joy Mukherjee, Vishwajit, Manmohan Krishna, Om Prakash, Asit Sen, Prem Chopra, AK Hangal and The name of Ramesh Dev comes, while among the actresses are Priya Dynasty, Nargis, Hema Malini, Sharmila Tagore, Rakhi Gulzar etc
 sattar ke dashak main jin abhinaytaon kii charchaa huyi unamem pramukh hai amitabh bachchan,anil kapur,naveen nishchal,rakesh roshan,rakesh bedi or om puri aadi, vahiin abhinetriyon main rekha,mumtaz,zeenat amaan,parveen bobi,nitu singh,shabana aazmi,priti gaangulii,priti sapru aadi charchit rahi
 Similarly in the eighties, actors like Sanjay Dutt, Sunny Deol, Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, etc
 made a big entry, while among the actresses were Madhuri Dixit, Juhi Chawla, Amita Nangia etc
 80 ke dashak tak filmein jameendaari, stri shoshan sahit un sabhi muddon par aadhaarit hoti thi jo samaaj ko prabhavit karte the
 Their aim was social welfare and not commercial
 par 90 ke dashak main filmon main vyapak badlaav aaye
 Filmmakers started choosing subjects that were of a very limited class choice, but in return they were going to earn dollars, so commercial interests were not going to suffer
 or ye vahi daur tha jab filmein samaaj hit se hatakar puri tarah se vyavasik hit main ram gayi
 The purpose of directors and producers who make films, instead of making reality in the film, was to put things that entertain the viewer which today has a negative effect on the society
 aaj bhartiya samaaj jo aadhuniktaa kii nangi daud main daud rahaa uskaa shrey bahut had aaj ke daur nirmit hone vaali filmon ko hi jaataa he agar udhaaharan se samajhnaa ho to nabbe ke dashak ke uttarardh main bani film ‘dilavaale dulhaniya le jaaenge’ se shuru karke ‘nil or nikki’ tak kii kahani main is badlaav ko dekha ja saktaa he
 This change needs to be seen in two forms
 ek rup he bharat ke gharelu filmkaaron kaa or doosraa pravasi bhartiya filmkaaron kaa
 The plot of both the films is surprisingly similar
 inamen se jo log paariwarik drama nahin bana rahe hai ve yaa to ausat darje kii suspence thriller or aparaadh katha par film bana rahe hai yaa sampann gharon ke yuvaaon va mahanagaron ke yuvaaon ke jivan main upabhoktavaadi samskruti kii anivaary khami ke rup main aae tanaavon par film bana rahe hai
 Among the domestic filmmakers, successful filmmakers like Aditya Chopra, Karan Johar, Rakesh Roshan, Ram Gopal Varma, Farhan Akhtar can be named and in the second category Gurinder Chanda, Nagesh Kukunoor, Vivek Ranjan Bald, Beni Mathew, Nisha Pahuja, Mahesh Dattani, Meera Nair, Shekhar Kapur, Deepa Mehta etc
 can be named, which essentially make films for migrants
 puraane jamaane main ‘teesri kasam’ se lekar ‘bhuwan shom’ or ankur, anubhav or avishkaar tak filmon kaa samaanaantar andolan chalaa
 Through these films, the audience saw the plot based on a realistic backdrop
 They were also impressed by the test and their strong expressions
 naye daur main vijay dandetha kii kahani par aadhaarit film ‘paheli’ shyaam benegal kii ‘welcome tu sajjanpur’ or ‘weldon abba’, ashutosh goarikar kii ‘lagaan’, ‘swadesh’, aamir khan abhinit ‘thri idiyats’, amitabh bachchan abhinit ‘paa’ or ‘blike’, shahrukh khan abhinit ‘maai nem ij khan’ jaise kuch naam hi saamne aate hai jo kathanak or abhivyakti kii drushti se shashakt maane jate hai
 The 60s and 70s was established as the melodious decade of Hindi films, and in the 80s and 90s, Hindi cinema emerged as 'bollywood'
 nabbe ke dashak main sanjay kapur,akshay kumaar,sunil shetty,saif ali khan,ajay devgan aadi abhinaytaon kaa to vahiin abhinetriyon main divya bharti,bipasha basu,karishma kapur,karina kapur,manisha koirala,kaajol devgan,rani mukherjee,priti zinta aadi kaa aagaman hua
 Similarly, in the 2000s, actors and actresses like Shahid Kapoor, Hrithik Roshan, Abhishek Bachchan, Fardeen Khan etc
 Priyanka Chopra, Neetu Chandra, Deepika Padukone, Anushka Sharma, Sonam Kapoor, Amisha Patel, Preity Zhangiani and Sonakshi Sinha in the 2010s Arrived 1931 main ardeshir irani ne bharat kii pehali sawak film alam aara kaa pradarshan kiya
 In the same year, Tamil's first Sawak film Kalidas and Telugu film Sawak Bhakta Prahlad were screened
 new theatres ne bangala main chandidas film kaa nirmaan 1932 main kiya tha
 After this, the process of producing Sawak films in many languages of India started rapidly
 mook filmon ke puure daur main adhiktar filmein yaa to puranic yaa dharmik yaa aitihaasik kathaon par aadhaarit hoti thim
 Some films were also made on popular stories from Arabia, Europe etc
 lekin saamaajik vishyon par filmon kaa nirmaan bahut hi kam hua
 In silent cinema itself, filmmakers like Baburao Painter had emerged, for whom cinema was not only a medium of entertainment but also a medium for conveying social messages
 1930 or 1940 ke dashak main marathi or hindustani filmon ko oonchaaiyon kii ore le jane vaale es

 The credit for the introduction of realism in Indian cinema goes to Baburao Painter
 1 janvari 1961 ko ek film aayi ‘ganga jamuna’
 Awadhi dialogues were used in this film
 hindi cinema ke itihaas main yah pehali baar hua tha
 The film was a huge success
 iske nirmaataa dilip kumaar ke bhai nasir khan evam nirdeshak nitin bose the
 Nazir Hussain also acted in the film along with Dilip Kumar and Vyjayanti Mala
 ‘ganga jamuna’ ne yah vishwaas kaayam kar diya tha ki agar koi uttar bhartiya boliyon-bhashaaon main bhi filmein banaae, to vah ghate kaa sauda nahin hoga
 Taking inspiration from this, the famous Hindi film actor Shiv Kumar started Brajbhasha cinema in North India
 varsh 1982 main relies film braj bhumi ke saath brajabhasha cinema kaa armbh hua
 The first President of India wished that film production in Bhojpuri too
 unki is ichha ke drushtigat bhojpuri kii pehali film kaa nirmaan hua, jiskaa naam tha "he ganga maiyaa tohe piyari chadhibo"
 Filmmaker Vishwanath Prasad Shahabadi dedicated the then President Desharatna Dr
 Rajendraprasad on 21 February 1963 at the Sadaqat Ashram in Patna
 yani 21 farvari 1963 ko is film kaa udghaatan samaaroh samajha gaya
 a day later, on 22 February 1963, a premiere show of the film was put at Veena Cinema in Patna
 lekin iske vyavsaayik pradarshan kii shuruyaat 4 april 1963 ko varanasi ke prakaash tokies se hui
 It is a matter of surprise that this year Indian cinema is going to celebrate its centenary anniversary and on the other hand Bhojpuri cinema is also completing its twenty five year
 parsi theatre ne hindi-urdu vivaad se pare rahete hue bolchaal kii ek aisi bhashaa kii parampara sthapit kii jo hindi or urdu kii sankeernataaon se pare thi or jise baad main hindustani ke naam se janaa gaya
 It was developed as a contact language in a large part of the Indian subcontinent
 hindi cinema ne aarambh se hi bhashaa ke isi rup ko apanaaya
 This language also made Hindi cinema popular among non-hindi speaking audiences
 unhone hindu-muslim ekta ko pratyaksh or paroksh rup se badhaava diya
 Aga Hashra Kashmiri drama 'jew' is the best example of this, on which films were made many times and Bimal Rai also considered it necessary to make a film on this drama
 bhartiya cinema ke sau saal ke itihaas main anek aise kalakaar or fankaar hue hai jinhone sidhe janata ke dilon main apni jagah banaai
 The position of some directors in Indian cinema is highly respected, where the audience spent their heads and eyes, while the whole world bowed and saluted

 Sustainability means in ecology how a biological system can keep producing for a long time while maintaining diversity

 Konark Surya Mandir is revered in the city of Puri under Puri district of the state of Orissa in India
 yah bharatvarsh ke chuninda surya mandiron main se ek he
 In 1984, UNESCO has recognized it as a World Heritage Site
 yah mandir surya-dev arthath arq ko samarpit tha, jinhen sthaneey log biranchi-narayan kehete the
 For this reason, this region was called ark-kshetra or padma-kshetra
 puraanon ke anusaar shrikrishna ke putr samb ko unke shraap se kodh rog ho gaya tha
 Samb did penance for twelve years in Konark at the ocean confluence of the Chandrabhaga river at Mitravan and pleased the Sun God
 suryadev, jo sabhi rogon ke naashak the, ne iske rog kaa bhi nivaaran kar diya tha
 Accordingly, Samb decided to build a temple of the Sun God
 apane rog-naash ke uparaant, chandrabhaga nadi main snaan karte hue, use suryadev kii ek murti mili
 This idol was made by Devashilpi Sri Vishwakarma from the same part of Suryadev's body
 samb ne apane banawaaye mithravan main ek mandir main, is murti ko sthapit kiya, tab se yah sthaan pavitra mana jane laga
 It is the opinion of many historians that due to the premature death of King Langul Narsinghdeva, the builder of the Konark temple, the construction work of the temple fell into disrepair
 iske parinamswaroop, adhuraa dhaancha dhwast ho gaya
 But this view is not supported by historical figures
 puri ke madal panji ke aankadon ke anusaar or kuch 1278 i
 ke tamrapatron se pataa chalaa, ki raja langool nrisinghdev ne 1282 tak shashan kiya
 Many historians are also of the opinion that the Konark temple was built between 1253 to 1260 AD
 atev mandir ke apurna nirmaan kaa iske dhwast hone kaa kaaran hona tarksangat nahin he
 It is no less than a complex task to mention the entire reasons for the demolition of the temple here
 parantu yah sarvavidit he ki ab iskaa kaaphi bhaag dhwast ho chukaa he
 The main reason for this is also called Vastu Dosh, but the role of Muslim invasions has been important
 kaha jaataa he ki yah mandir apane vaastu dosha ke kaaran maatr 800 varshon main ksheen ho gaya tha
 Which is heard and heard against Vastu art and rules
 isi karanvash yah apni samyavadhi se pehle hi rugavedakaal evam pashaan kala kaa anupam udhaaharan hote hue bhi dharashayi ho gaya
 The main architectural defects of this Sun-temple are: -
 kai kathaon ke anusaar, surya mandir ke shikhar par ek chumbakeey pathar laga he
 As a result of this, the ocean ships passing through the sea of konark are drawn towards this, causing heavy damage to them
 anya katha anusaar, is pathar ke kaaran poton ke chumbakeey disha nirupan yantra sahi disha nahin bataate
 For this reason, Muslim sailors took out this stone to save their grandsons
 yah pathar ek kendriya shila kaa kaary kar rahaa tha, jisase mandir kii deevaaron ke sabhi pathar santulan main the
 Due to its removal, the balance of the temple walls was lost and as a result they collapsed
 parantu is ghatana kaa koi aitihaasik vivaran nahin miltaa, naa hi aise kisi chumbakeey kendriya pathar ke astitv kaa koi byora uplabdh he
 a very important theory related to the fall of Konark temple is associated with Kalapahad
 urisa ke itihaas ke anusaar kalapahaad ne san 1508 main yahaan akraman kiya or konark mandir samet urisa ke kai hindu mandir dhwast kar diye
 Madan Panji of the Jagannath temple in Puri tells how Kalapahar attacked Orissa
 konark mandir sahit usne adhikansh hindu mandiron kii pratimaayein bhi dhwast kareen
 Although it was impossible to break the 20-25 feet thick walls of the Konark temple, he somehow managed to shake Dadhinauti, which caused the temple to collapse
 dadhinauti ke hatane ke kaaran hi mandir dhire-dhire girane laga tathaa chat se baari pathar girane se, mukashaala kii chat bhi dhwast ho gayi
 He also demolished most of the sculptures here and many other temples in Konark
 san 1568 main urisa main muslimon kaa aatank niyantran main ho chukaa tha
 But even after this, there were continuous efforts to break the Hindu temples
 is samay puri ke jagannatha mandir ke pandon ne bhagwaan jagannatha ji kii murti ko shrimandir se hataakar kisi gupt sthaan par chupa diya tha
 Similarly, the pandas of the Sun Temple of Konark removed the idol of the presiding deity and kept it hidden in the sand for years
 baad main, yah murti puri bhej di gayi or vahaan jagannatha mandir ke praangan main sthit, indra ke mandir main rakh di gayi
 According to others, the worship idols here are still to be discovered
 lekin kai logon kaa kahana he, ki surya dev kii murti, jo nai dilli ke rashtriya sangrahalay main rakhi he, vahi konark kii pradhan poojya murti he
 Yet in Konark, Surya Vandana ceased after the removal of the idol from the temple
 is kaaran konark main tirthayatriyon kaa aana janaa band ho gaya
 Konark's port also closed due to bandits attack
 konark surya vandana ke samaan hi vanijyik gatividhiyon hetu bhi ek kirtivan nagar tha, parantu in gatividhiyon ke band ho jane ke kaaran, yah ekadam nirvasit ho chalaa or varshon tak ek gahan jangal se dhank gaya
 In 1626, the king of Khurda, Narasimha Dev, son Shri Purushottam Dev, took the idol of Suryadev to Puri along with two other statues of Surya and Chandra
 ab ve puri ke mandir ke praangan main milti hai
 It is known from the history of the Madal Register of Puri that in 1028, King Naseenhadeva ordered the measurement of all the temples of Konark
 maapan ke samay, surya mandir apni amalak shila tak astitv main tha, yani ki lagbhag 200 feet ooncha
 Kalapahad destroyed not only its urn, but also the padma-dhwaja, kamal-kirit and the upper part
 pehle bataaye anusaar, mukhshala ke saamne, ek bada prastar khand – navagraha paat, hota tha
 The then king of Khurda removed that block, as well as took a number of sculpted stones from Konark

 After the First World War, the defeated Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919
 isaki vajah se germany ko apni bhoomi ke ek bade hisse se haath dhonaa padaa, duusare rajyon par kabja karne kii paabandi laga di gayi, unki sena kaa aakaar simit kar diya gaya or baari kshatipurti thope di gayi
 The Treaty of Versailles was forced on Germany
 is kaaran adolf hitler or anya german log ise apmanjanak maanate the or is tarah se yah sandhi dwitiya vishwayuddh ke kaarnon main se ek thi
 The Paris Peace Conference drafted and signed several treaties and agreements, but in all these treaties the Treaty of Versailles with Germany is important in many respects and prominent in all treaties
 chaar maheene ke parishram ke baad sandhi kaa masavida taiyaar hua
 The treaty, written in 230 pages, was divided into 15 parts and contained 440 sections
 6 may, 1919 ko yah sammelan ke sammukh pesh hui or sweekrut ho gayi
 On 30 April, the German delegation led by Foreign Minister Count Fon Brockdouf Rantaju reached Versailles
 pratinidhiyon ko trayanan pales hotel main tehraaya gaya
 The officers of the Allies were looking after their security
 hotel ko kantedaar taron se gher diya gaya tha or german pratinidhiyon ko manaahi kar di gayi thi ki ve mitrarashtron ke kisi pratinidhi yaa kisi patrkaar se kisi prakaar kaa sampark rakhen
 On 7 May, the Climes presented a treaty to the German delegation in front of other delegations, in front of the German delegation
 is masavide par vichaar-vimarsh karne ke liye unhen keval do saptaah kaa samay diya gaya
 Germany had to sign the treaty anyway
 german raajnneetigyon ne gambhirtha ke saath sandhi ke masavide par vichaar kiya or 26 dinon ke baad apni taraf se saath hajaar shabdon kaa ek virdohi prastaav prastut kiya
 Germany had complained that the terms on which it had surrendered violated those principles in the proposed treaty
 unka kahana tha ki germany kii nayi sarkaar purna rup se prajatantric he or rashtrasang kii sadsyta ke liye icchhuk he
 The condition of disarmament should be applied not only to Germany but to all states
 vishwayuddh ke liye ekmaatr germany ko jimmedaar tehraana galat he
 The German proposal also stated that it is impossible to assume all the terms of the treaty
 ek bade raashtra ko kuchalakar tathaa use gulam banaakar sthaayee shanti sthapit nahin kii ja sakati
 The Allies considered the proposals of Germany and after some minor changes Germany was asked to sign the revised treaty within five days
 is baar germany ko yah avasar nahin diya gaya ki vah sandhi ke masavide ke sambandh main kisi prakaar kaa sanshodhan yaa nivedan prastut kar sake
 The Allies had made it clear that not signing would mean a re-invasion of Germany
 ant main german sarkaar ne sandhi par hastakshar karnaa sweekaar kar liye
 The formation and organization of the League of Nations was an extremely important part of the Treaty of Versailles
 sandhi ke pratham bhaag kaa sambandh isi se he
 It was originally President Wilson's creation
 uskaa khyaal tha ki rashtrasang ko shanti-sammelan kii sabase mahaan kriti honi chahie
 Lloyd George wrote that Wilson used to give the most importance to only the part of the peace treaties which had the League of Nations
 iske liye vah koi bhi tyaag karne ke liye taiyaar tha or ant main uske kathin prayaas se hi rashtrasang kaa nirmaan hua
 Barring Wilson, other representatives of the Allied view were of the view that it was not necessary to put the matters of the League under the Treaty of Versailles
 antatah wilson kii baat maan lee gayi or rashtrasang ke samvidhan ko varsay-sandhi ke antargat hi rakh diya gaya
 The first 26 sections of the Treaty of Versailles are the constitution of the League of Nations, whose purpose was to increase international cooperation and to maintain international peace and security
 alss-lauren pradesh : varsay-sandhi dwaara pradeshik parivartan karke germany kaa ang-bhang kar diya gaya
 In 1871, Germany seized the territory of elsse-laurent from France
 sabon ne ek swar se is baat ko sweekaar kiya ki yah ek galat kaam hua tha or iskaa ant aavashyak he
 Hence, the terms of the treaty were given back to the territories of alsace-lorraine to France
 rinland : france kii suraksha kii drushti se germany ke rinland main mitra rashtron kii sena 15 varshon tak rahegi tathaa rin nadi ke aas-paas ke kshetra ko sthai rup se nihshastr kar diya jaae taaki germany kisi prakaar kii kilabandi na kar sake
 Saar region: Saar region was famous for the coal field in Germany
 is pradesh kii shashan vyavastha kii jimmevary rashtrasang ko saunp di gai kintu koyale kii khaanon kaa swaamitv france ko diya gaya
 It was also decided that after 15 years a referendum would decide whether the people of the Saar region would stay with Germany or with France
 yadi saravasi germany ke saath milane kii ichha prakat karen to germany france ko nishchit mulya dekar khaanon ko punah kharid le
 Receipt of Belgium and Denmark: The territories of Uppen Marshnet and Malamedi were reduced to Belgium
 shleshwig main janamat sangrah karke uskaa uttari bhaag denmark ko de diya gaya
 Germany's eastern border: Germany suffered the most on the eastern border
 mitra rashtron ne swatantra poland rajya ke nirmaan kaa nirnay kiya
 Danzing was converted into an independent city and kept under the protection of the League of Nations
 poland ko samudri maarg dene ke liye dajing ke bandargah kaa upyog karne kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 The port of Memel was transferred from Germany to Lithuania
 germany ne checkoslovakia ke rajya ko manyata di
 Thus under the territorial system, Germany had to lose 25 thousand square miles of territory and a population of 70 lakhs
 german upnivesh sambandhi vyavastha : mitra raashtra german upniveshon ko apane-apane samrajya main milanaa chaahate the kintu wilson ne iskaa kadaa virodh kiya
 Allies introduced the patronage system due to Wilson's opposition
 iskaa aashay yah tha ki jo desh bahut pichde hue he unka samuchit kalyaan va vikaas karnaa
 The form of holy heritage in civilized nations should be given by the League of Nations for its advancement
 Mindet vyavastha ke tahat germany ko apni sabhi upnivesh chhodane pade or unhen mitra-rashtron ke sangrakshan main rakhaa gaya
 Many islands in the Pacific Ocean and colonies in the African continents were lost to Germany
 german sena kii adhiktam sankhya ek lakh kar di gai
 Compulsory military service was banned
 hawaii jahaajon ko pratibandhit kar diya gaya
 In addition, naval power was also limited
 germany kii nausena ke keval 6 yudhpot rakhane kii ijaajat di gai
 There was talk of handing the submarines to the Allies
 nihshastreekaran kii is vyavastha kaa paalan karwaane tathaa nigaraanee rakhane ke liye germany ke kharch par mitra rashtron kaa ek sainik ayog sthapit kiya gaya
 Thus, Germany was crippled in military terms
 varsay sandhi kii 231veen dhara ke tahat germany va uske sahyogi rajyon ko yuddh ke liye ek maatr jimmedaar mana gaya
 Therefore, for the compensation that the Allies had to bear in the war, Germany was asked to compensate the Allies by 1921
 mitra rashtron ko germany se kuch vastu ke aayaat-niryaat par vishesh suvidhaayen di gai
 The Nile Canal was internationalized and left open to all ships
 sandhi kii 231veen dhara ke anusaar sari kshati or yuddh ke liye germany ko uttaradaayi tehraaya gaya
 The establishment of the League of Nations under the political system was an important part of the Treaty of Warsaw
 wilson ke prabhaav ke kaaran hi rashtrasang kii dhaaraon ko varsay kii sandhi main rakhaa gaya
 The purpose of the League of Nations was to establish international cooperation and security
 vishwa itihaas main hui anek sandhiyon main varsay kii sandhi sarvaadhik varnit or vivaadit rahi he
 In fact, this treaty deeply influenced the course of world history
 in sandhi kii teevr aalochana kii jaati he or is dwitiya vishwayuddh ke beej ke rup main samajha jaataa he
 Criticism of this treaty can be seen under the following points- 1
 aropit sandhi : varsay kii sandhi ko “ek laadi gai shanti” kii sangya arthath “aropit sandhi” ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Germany was not accommodated in the conference when drafting the treaty
 yah mitra rashtron kaa aadesh tha jise sweekaar karne ke atirikt germany ke samaksh koi doosraa upaay nahin tha
 They were also threatened by the German representatives, if they did not sign the treaty within five days, they would be attacked again
 atah germany ke man main yah baat baith gai ki yah aropit sandhi he jise maanane ke liye vah baadhya nahin he
 This is the reason why Germany later turned down the treaty provisions
 2
 jansadharan kii shanti nahin, rajanyikon kii shaanti : varsay kii sandhi main ullekith praavdhaan jansadharan ke hit or aakankshaon ko puraa nahin kar sake
 There were many regional arrangements that needed to be amended
 kshatipurti main kai aise praavdhaan kiye gaye the jo europe ke audyogic punerjeevan ko vinaashkari aghat pahuchaaye bina vasuul nahin kiye ja sakate the
 In this way, this treaty of peace of the public does not complete
 3
 kathor evam apmanjanak sharten : varsay kii sandhi dwaara germany ko chhin-bhinn kar diya gaya, upnivesh chin aarthik rup se pangu bana diya gaya, aarthik sansadhano par duusare rashtron kaa swaamitv sthapit kar diya gaya or sainik drushti se use aapng bana diya gaya
 The condition of compensation was very harsh and humiliating
 kshatipurti kii rakam adaa na karne kii sthiti main germany ke kshetron par kabja karne kii baat kii gai
 In fact, the conquering nation imposed harsh conditions on Germany under retaliation
 sandhi kii sharte itani kathor thi ki koi bhi swabhimani, susanskrit raashtra ise sahan nahin kar saktaa tha
 In Churchill's words, "its economic conditions were stigmatized and ill-informed to the extent that they made it manifestly meaningless
" ” 4
 The treaty was harsh in the wrong places and unfairly soft: The treaty was not only unusually harsh, but it was harsh in the wrong places and unfairly soft
 tathakthith yuddh aparaadh sambandhi praavdhaanon germany dwaara sweekrut karaane kaa praytn yatharth se pare tha kyonki jaisaa david thamsan ne kaha “is baat kaa ullekh aise masaude main shaamil karke jis par hastakshar karne ke liye german pratinidhi vivash kiye gaye naiki uttardaayitv kii bhaavana utpann nahin kar sakate the
 “the second compensation was also demanded in improbable amounts and its huge amount was fixed without any serious consideration
 aarthik drushti se yah sampada germany ke liye chukaana tathaa mitra rashtron ke liye praapt karnaa kaise sambhav hoga, iskaa vishleshan nahin kiya gaya tha
 Undoubtedly, the entire size of the punishment and compensation was inconsiderate and impractical
 uparyukt sabhi prakaar kii anaavashyak kathorataayen germany ke rashtriya asantosh va krodh ko abhivyakti karne kii uski kshamta ke viruddh koi pruthak kadam nahin uthaaya gaya
 This treaty was unfairly soft, it was hardly appropriate to rule the 'essence region' by the League of Nations for 15 years and return it to Germany in 1935
 rinland par 15 varsh tak mitra rashtron kaa adhikaar bhi khokhla siddh hua
 5
 Retaliatory Treaty: The conquering nations imposed harsh terms on Germany by adopting a vengeful attitude
 france apni puraani paraajay or ampan kaa badla lenaa chaah rahaa tha us drushti se sandhi main germany ke saath adhiktam kathor praavdhaan kiye gaye
 6
 Abusive Treaty: This treaty was a cause of national humiliation for Germany
 kaisar wiliam kii apadasta, baari kshati purti raashi kii vasuuli
 Allied states' authority on German shores, Karkhono, rivers, etc
, and the presence of armies in Germany, the division of Germany, the plunder of the colonies by friendly countries and discriminatory, unequal, unjust conditions, etc
 were all derogatory
 sandhi patron par hastakshar ke liye aane vaale german pratinidhiyon ke saath klemensho kaa abhadra vyavhar, unhen kaidiyon ke saamaan rakhana, janata dwaara gaaliyaan, sade hue fal, inte,pathar ko un par phekna adi pratinidhiyon kaa apmaan nahin balki germany kaa apmaan tha
 7
 Treacherous Treaty: The Treaty of Warsaw was considered morally unfair and treacherous to Germany
 germany ne wilson ke 14 sutron ke aadhaar par yuddh kar sandhi karnaa sweekaar kiya tha lekin varsay kii sandhi main wilson ke in sutron kaa khuleam ulanghan hua tha
 The principle of nationalism was not followed with Germany
 us par bahut si sharte lad di gai thi
 But the winners are exempt from that
 wilson ke tisare sutara ke anusaar anterrashtriya vyapaar kii samast rukawate dur karne kaa praytn karnaa tha, kintu germany kii samuhik swtantraa surakshit nahin thi
 His international trade remained under the control of the Allies for years
 14 sutron main sabhi rashtron ke shastron ke kami karne kaa suzav diya gaya tha, kintu mitra rashtron ne apane shastron main kami kiye bina germany kii sainik shakti ko atyant simit kar diya
 The Allies followed Wilson's 14 sources to the same extent as he benefited
 is tarah varsay kii sandhi main germany ke saath vishwasghaat kiya gaya
 To further avenge this betrayal, Germany went to war
 8
 sandhi ke pranetaon main vaicharik sangharsh : varsay kii sandhi ne teen bado ke vichaara or uddeshyon main sangharsh kii sthiti maujuud thi
 There was opposition between Wilson's high but impractical view, between Climenso's nationalist and realist demands, and Lloyd George's opportunistic motives, despite their agreement on the Treaty of Warsaw that reflected their imperialist and exploitative mentality
 logsan ke anusaar “wilson ke adarshavaad or sammelan ke bhautikwaad main teevr virodh tha or zyaadaatar maamalon main bhautikwaad vijayi rahaa
 " 9
 sanghash ke naye daur kii shuruuaat : varsay kii sandhi ne europea rashtron ke bich vishwavyapa satta ke liye nae sangharsh kii shuruuaat kii
 Until 1919, international law believed in the distinction between the property of a country's government and its citizens
 kintu varsay kii sandhi ke anusaar yuddhrat desh apane tathaa apane mitra rashtron kii seemaa main kisi shatru desh ke vyakti kii kisi prakaar kii sampati jabt kar saktaa tha
 If he was victorious in the war, he could force the government of the defeated country to compensate for its citizens' confiscated property
 yah ek nayaa drushtaant tha
 10
 Hatred towards the Weimar Republic: After the war, the Weimar Republic was established in Germany and was seen to be associated with the Treaty of Warsaw
 tamaam udaaravaadi visheshtaon ke bich ise shatru paksh dwaara sthapit sanstha mana gaya
 Therefore, in Germany, democracy became a system of dualism, hateful and hostile
 11
 aatmanirnay ke siddhant kii avhelnaa : italy kii simaaen rashtrawaad ke siddhant par nirdhaarit nahin kii gai, na hi poland kii bhoomi par sabhi naagarik nirvivaadit rup se pole the
 Similarly, parts of the Turkish Empire were not promised sovereignty
 rashtrasang vishaal va laghu rajyon ke samaan raajnneetik samprabhutaa dilaane main asamarth rahaa
 Regarding the moral aspect and tactical compatibility of this treaty, AJP Taylor states that "from the beginning the Treaty of Warsaw lacked moral recognition
" germany ke vishay main aatm nirnay ke siddhant kii avhelnaa kii gai
 Many nations of Europe were reorganized according to President Wilson's principle of self-determination
 isse anusaar ek hi raashtra jati, ek hi bhashaa evam saanskrithik parampara vaale logon ko milakar unka pruthak tantra banane kaa nishchay kiya gaya
 On this basis, independent states of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia were born
 kintu is siddhant kaa germany, austria or hungary ke sambandh main paalan nahin kiya gaya
 Thousands of German citizens were separated from the German Empire and subjugated to other states
 ” 1918 i
 main jab austria ke germanon ne german-austria ganatantr kii sthapana kii or german ke ganatantr ke saath sammilit hone va land ko milaane kii ichha vyakt kii tab mitra rajyon dwaara sitambar 1919 i
 main donon rajyon ke sammilan par pratibandh laga diya gaya
 Thus the German citizens were disappointed by not implementing the principle accepted by the Allies about Germany
 butlerane anusaar “aatmanirnay ke siddhant kaa yuktiyukt prayog na karnaa paris kii vyavastha main antarnihit kamajori kaa dyotak tha
 " vishwa itihaas ke jin ek sandhiyon or uske prabhaavon kii sarvaadhik charchaa hui he, unamem varsay kii sandhi kaa vishisht sthaan he
 Critics have defined it as the cause of World War II in terms of the harsh provisions of that treaty and its form
 unke anusaar varsay kii sandhi shanti kii vyavastha na hokar asantosh kii janak thi
 Just after 20 years, 2 months and 4 days after the treaty, this world was hit by the Second World War
 sandhi hone ke baad se hi uski vyavasthaaon ko germany dwaara bhang kiya jaataa rahaa
 At the same time amendments were also made to the treaty provisions
 in sandhi praavdhaanon ke ulalanghanon evam sanshodhano ne sansar ko dwitiya vishwa yuddh kii ore dhakel diya
 The treaty provisions were violated and amended because it was too harsh and abusive
 aisi kathor evam apmanjanak sandhi kii sharton ko koi bhi swabhimani raashtra ek lambey samay tak bardaasht nahin kar saktaa tha
 Therefore, it was clear that Germany would try to get rid of the system imposed by the Versailles Treaty and wash away the stigma of humiliation as soon as the above opportunities are given in future
 germany kii catholic centre party ke agerburger kaa viraam sandhi ke samay vaktavy tha ki "german jati ksht sahegi parantu maregi nahin
 "naturally, Germany made a successful attempt to wash away these derogatory terms
 parinamswaroop kuch hi varshon main europe kaa raajnneetik vaataavaran atyant ashaant ho gaya or vishwa ko pratham mahayuddh se bhi adhik bhayankar or pralayankari yuddh dekhnaa padaa
 Even according to France's Marshal Fouche "this treaty is not peace, only a 20-year ceasefire
" " spasht he ki isi sandhi main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke beej vidyaman the
 At the time of the treaty in 1919, Germany was helpless and had no choice but to quietly accept the treaty but as time passed, it began to breach the terms of the treaty by accumulating some power and the treaty makers also Made amendments
 1926 main jab germany ko rashtrasang kii sadsyta di gai tab sandhi ke pratham bhaag main sanshodhan kiya gaya
 The seventh part of the war criminals was never fully implemented
 german samraat wiliam kaisar sahit anek yuddh aparaadhiyon ko dand na dekar mahaj kuch ek ko saamaanya dand die gaye
 The provision relating to compensation was first amended and later abandoned altogether
 lojaan sammelan main kshatipurti ke prashn ko hi samaapt kar diya gaya
 After Hitler's rise to German politics in 1933–34, breaking the terms of Warsaw became a minor thing
 1935-36 main hitler ne sandhi ke nihshastreekaran se sambandhit praavdhaanon kaa ulanghan kar senaaon main vruddhi kii or 1936 main rinland par adhikaar kar liya
 In March 1938, Hitler dissolved the provisions of the territorial arrangements of the Treaty of Warsaw by combining Austria with Germany and September 1938 in Czechoslovakia
 jab hitler ne varsay sandhi dwaara nirmit poland se sambandhit polish galiyare evam danging bandargah sambandhi vyavasthaaon ko todane ke uddeshy se poland par akraman kiya to dwitiya vishwayuddh prarambh ho gaya
 To break the unjust arrangements of the Versailles Treaty, Hitler started a series of events that led to the outbreak of the Second World War
 is tarah varsay kii sandhi praavdhaanon ke unmoolan kii prakriya kii antim parinti dwitiya vishwayuddh ke aarambh main hui
 From this point of view, the seeds of World War II can be seen in the Treaty of Versailles
 kuch aalochak maanate hai ki varsay sandhi kii kathor sharte nahin balki unako kriyanvit karne kii dhilaai dwitiya vishwayuddh kaa kaaran bani
 According to logsm is prakaar isamen koi andeh nahin ki varsay kii anyaaypurna kathor or apmanjanak sandhi, ek seemaa tak dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke liye uttaradaayi thi
 But it is also true that the conflicting policy of the Allies, neglect, indifference, appeasement and the policy of not strictly enforcing the terms of the treaty were also no less responsible for it

com Irwin Allen Ginsberg is a noted poet of the Beatnik movement in America
 inke dwaara likhit lambii kavita houl ko beet andolan kii mahakawita kaha jaataa he
 This poem is considered to be the voice of a new generation of Americans against capitalism and controlism, at a time when communist fears were gripped by American society
 prakashit hote hi isaki hajaaron pratiyaan bik gayin or ginsburg raaton raat nayi peedi ke maseehaa ban gayi, jis peedi ko aaj bitanic peedi kaha jaataa he
 Till date, millions of copies of this poem have been sold
 ginsburg dwaara nivedit houl kii visidi, sidi or dividi bhi khub biki hai or aaj tak unki yah pustak or dividi bik rahi hai
 For this poem, he adopted a new writing system that was based on breathing and exhaling time
 yadhyapi unke pita ek geetkaar the, par ginsburg ne apane pita dwaara dikhaaye gayi maarg par chalanaa uchit nahin samajha kyonki unhen mahasoos hua ki america samaaj badal chukaa he
 Ginsberg's mother, Nayomi Ginsberg, did not have a mental balance and had an impact on teenage Ginsberg
 houl prakashit hone ke baad unhone apni maa ke yaad me kaidish naam kii ek lambii kavita houl ke hi anuroop likhi thi
 After getting fame, he was invited to read poetry in many countries and he also came to India
 bharat aakar vah do saal tak yaheen rahe
 He spent many days in places like Benaras, Patna, Kolkata, Chaibasa etc
 and he got quite mixed with the local poets
 vah hindu or buddha saadhuon se bhi mili
 After returning to America, Ginsburg embraced Buddhism

 His daily account of the time spent in India has been written by Ginsberg in his India Journal where he has given an extended reference to the monks and ascetics who he met
 yah kitaab se pataa chalata he ki bharat unke dilodimag par kitna asar kar chukaa tha
 Even he changed his religion, while his parents were Jewish
 unka atyeshtibhi bhartiya reeti anusaar huya tha
 Like Jawaharlal Nehru, his remains were also immersed in the rivers of America

 In English, the satellite calls the ring "planatory ring" because it often forms around planets, but in scientific terms it can also be built around satellites and other objects
 vaigyanik rup se yah ek challa he jo upgrah kii tarah kisi grah yaa anya upgrah kii parikrama karata he
 Scientists believe that there may be three reasons for becoming a satellite ring - kisi jamaane main sochaa jaataa tha ke upgrahi challe sthai nahin ho sakate or karodon saal ke antaraal main dhire-dhire bikhar jate hai yaa phir judakar ek upgrah bana lete hai
 Conversely, close study of Saturn's rings has revealed that its rings have been intact since the early days of the solar system, that is, they have been in existence for billions of years

85 Barethi is a village in Handia block of Allahabad district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh
 paidurupadu main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke krishna jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Ajanta Caves There are about 29 rock-cut Buddhist caves located in Maharashtra, India, which belong to the 2nd century BCE
 yahan buddha dharm se sambandhit chithran evam shilpkaaree ke utkrisht namoonay milte hai
 Live illustrations are also available with them
 yah guphaayen ajanta naamak gaanv ke sannikat hi sthit he, jo ki maharashtra ke aurangabad jile main he
 Ajanta Caves have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983
 " According to "national Geographic": The flow of faith was such that almost all Buddhist temples, including Ajanta for centuries, seem to have been built under the rule and shelter of Hindu kings
 guphaayen ek ghaney jangal se ghiri, ashv naal aakaar ghati main ajanta gaanv se 31⁄2 kimi dur bani he
 The village is 106 km away from Aurangabad city of Maharashtra
 iskaa nikatatam kasbaa he jalgaam, jo 60 kimi dur he, bhusaval 70 kimi dur he
 In the foothills of this valley, the hill stream Vaghur flows
 yahan kul 29 guphaayen hai, jo ki nadi dwaara nirmit ek prapaat ke dakshin main sthit he
 Their elevation from the river ranges from 35 to 110 feet
 ajanta kaa math jaisaa samooh he, jisamen kai vihaar evam chaityas grih hai, jo ki do charnon main bane hai
 The first phase is mistakenly called the Hinayana phase, which is related to the Hinayana faith of Buddhism
 vastutah hinayan sthaviravaad ke liye ek shabd he, jisamen buddha kii moort rup se koi nishedh nahin he
 Ajanta's cave numbers 9, 10, 12, 13 15A were discovered at this stage
 in khudaayiyon main buddha ko stupa yaa math rup main darshit kiya gaya he
 Second phase excavations were discovered after nearly three centuries of stability
 is charan ko bhi galat rup main mahayan charan 9 buddha dharm kaa doosraa bada dhada, jo ki kamatar kattar he, evam buddha ko sidhe gaay aadi rup main chitron yaa shilpon main darshit karne kii anumati detaa he
 ) Many people call this phase Vakataka phase
 yah vatsagulm shakha ke shasit vansh vaakatak ke naam par he
 The construction date of this second phase is disputed among many academics
 haal ke varshon main kuch bahumat ke sanket ise paanchavin shatabdi main maanane lage hai
 According to Walter M
 Spink, an Ajanta expert, the Mahayan caves were built between 462–480 AD
 mahayan charan kii guphaayen sankhya hai 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, evam 29
 Cave number 8 was considered a cave of Hinayana phase for a long time, but at present it has been declared as Mahayan on the basis of facts
 mahayan, hinayan charan main do chaityagrih mili the, jo gupha sankhya 9 va 10 main the
 The cave numbers of this phase are 12, 13, 15 viharas
 mahayan charan main teen chaityas grih the jo sankhya 19, 26, 29 main the
 From the very beginning, the last cave was uninhabited
 anya sabhi mili guphaayen 1-3, 5-8, 11, 14-18, 20-25, va 27-28 vihaar hai
 The viharas found in the excavation are of several sizes, the largest being 52 feet, almost all square
 inke rup main bhi bhinnata he
 Many are simple, many are ornate, some are made of pavilions, and many are not
 sabhi viharon main ek aavashyak ghatak he— ek vrahat haul cameraa
 Among the Vakataka stages, many have not had holy places, because they were made only for religious gatherings and accommodation; Later holy places were added to them
 phir to yah ek maanak ban gaya
 The statue of Buddha in a central hall in this sacred place was often seated in the dharma-chakra-pramana posture
 jin gufaaon main naveenatam visheshtaayen hai, vahaan kinare kii deevaaron, dwaar mandapon par or praangan main gaun pavitra sthal bhi bane dikhte hai
 The walls of many viharas are decorated with carvings
 deevaaron or chhaton par bhitti chithran kiya hua he
 With the difference in Buddhist thought in the first century, Buddha was given the status of a deity and worshiped him
 parinamtah buddha ko puja-archana kaa kendra banaaya gaya; jisase mahayan kii utpatti hui
 In the past, academics divided the caves into three groups, but were rejected due to evidence and research
 us siddhanth ke anusaar 200 i purv se 200 i tak ek samooh, dwitiya samooh chhathi shatabdi kaa or tritiy samooh saatvin shatabdi kaa mana jaataa tha
 The expression cave temple used by the anglo-indians for the viharas was considered inappropriate
 ajanta ek prakaar kaa mahavidhyalay math tha
 Hiuen Tsang states that Dinnag, a famous Buddhist philosopher, philosopher who was the author of several texts on logic, lived here
 yah abhi anya saakshyon se pramanit hona shesh he
 At its peak, the Viharas had the ability to accommodate hundreds
 yahan shikshak or chaatr ek saath rahete the
 It is very sad that no cave of Vakataka stage is complete
 yah is kaaran hua ki shaasha vaakatak vansh ekaek shaktiviheen ho gaya, jisase uski praja bhi sankat main aa gayi
 Due to this, all activities were interrupted and stopped suddenly
 yah samay ajanta kaa antim kaal rahaa
 This is a first step and has no meaning in the sequence of other caves
 yah ashwanal aakaar kii dhaal par purvi ore se pratham gupha he
 According to Spink one of the last caves built at this site is towards the end of the Vakataka phase
 haalaanki koi shilalekhith sakshya upasthit nahin hai; phir bhi yah mana jaataa he ki vaakatak raja harisena is uttam sangrakshit gupha ke sangrakshak rahe hon
 The main reason for this is that Harisena was not initially involved in the protection of Ajanta, but could not stay away from them for a long time, because this site was full of activities during his reign and his Buddhist subjects were given this sacred work of that Hindu king
 Could be happy to shelter
 yahan darshit kai vishay rajsik hai
 This cave has very elaborate carving work, which also has many highly embossed crafts
 yahan buddha ke jivan se sambandhit kai ghatnaayen ankit hai, saath hi anek alankaran namoonay bhi hai
 Its two-storied gate-pavilion, which was visible until the nineteenth century, is now extinct
 is gupha ke aage ek khulaa sthaan tha, jiske donon ore khambhedaar galiyare the
 Its level was relatively high
 iske dwaar mandap ke donon ore kothiyaan hai
 The absence of the pillared cells at the end suggests that this pavilion was not built with the last phase of Ajanta, when the pillared cells had become a regular part
 porch kaa adhikansh kshetra kabhi muraal se bharaa rahaa hoga, jiske kai avshesh abhi bhi shesh hai
 There are three gateways here, one central and two sideways
 in dwarpathon ke bich do vargakar khidkiyaan taraashi hui he, jinase antas ujjwalit hota tha
 Each wall of the hall is about 40 feet long and 20 feet high
 baarah stambh andar ek vargakar coloned banaate hai jo chat ko sahaara dete hai, saath hi deevaaron ke saath-saath ek galiyara-sa banaate hai
 a gargantuan image is carved on the back wall, in which the Buddha is shown seated in his dharma-chakra-vimana posture
 peeche, baayin evam daayin diwaar main chaar-chaar kamare bane hai
 These walls are full of paintings, which are in a perfect state of preservation
 darshit drishy adhiktar upadeshon, dharmik evam alankaran ke hai
 Their subjects are related to Jataka tales, life of Gautama Buddha, etc
 gupha sankhya 1 se lagi gupha san 2, deevaaron, chhaton evam stambhon par sangrakshit apni chitrakaari ke liye prasiddh he
 It looks very beautiful and looks almost similar to the cave number, but is in a far better state of conservation
 is gupha main do dwaar-mandap hai, jo ki sankhya 1 se bahut alag he
 Rather, the carving of the panels also looks different from that
 is gupha ko sahaara diye do achche khaase mote stambh hai, jo ki baari nakkashi se alankrita hai
 Yes, it definitely resembles the first cave in size, shape and land plan
 saamne kaa porch donon ore stambhon se yukt prakoshthon se yukt he
 Formerly, rooms made up of vacant spaces were necessary when the latter required space, as the latter increased the need for more accommodation
 sabhi baad kii vaakatak nirmaanon main, porch ke ant main prakoshth aavashyak ang ban gayi
 Mural paintings on its roofs and walls have been published in sufficient quantity
 inamen buddha ke janm se purv bodhisattva rup ke anya janmon kii kathaayen hai

 'evidence' has two meanings: kai vishay aise hote hai, jinke liye pramaan kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 Other relevant topics are substantiated by evidence
 sakshi ke kathan, sweekaarokti evam upyukt kaagajon kii peshi sakshya ke antargat hai
 The first obligation to give evidence lies with the party who is to authenticate the case in the primary
 prayek paksh par pramanbhaar kaa apana-apana daayitv rahata he
 If the party who is responsible for giving evidence does not produce the appropriate evidence, then the court will give its decision against it
 dandabhiyog ke maamalon main pramanbhaar maamla chalaanevaale par rahata he
 There is no exception to this rule
 kanoon kii prakalpana he ki abhiyukt nirdosh he, jab tak uske viruddh laayaa hua abhiyog bilkul nihsandeh pramanit na kar diya jaay
 Therefore, in such cases, the charge rests on the person conducting the case and he / she has to prove each step of the prosecution, even if he has to give evidence on the negative content itself
 abhiyukt ko apane ko nirdosh pramanit nahin karnaa padataa
 In civil cases, the responsibility for the charge is on the party who asserts his or her self in the contentious matter
 yah niyam is siddhant par aadhaarit he ki jo paksh kisi vishay ke astitv kaa samarthan kare, use hi uskaa pramaan dena chahie, na ki pratipakshi ko jo vivaadaaspad vishay ke astitv ko sweekaar nahin karata
 Therefore, in civil cases, the charge remains on the plaintiff
 yadi vah us daayitv ko nibhaataa he tathaa maamle ko praathmik rup main pramanit karata he, jisase use traan mil sake to aisi sthiti main uske daawey ke viruddh pramaan dene kaa daayitv prativaadee par chalaa jaataa he
 During the testimony, when the responsibility of the charge will go from the plaintiff to the defendant and from the defendant to the plaintiff, it is difficult to say
 paraspar die gaye sakshya ke anusaar yah badalata rahata he
 But ultimately the charge remains on the party who, by not giving evidence in response to the evidence of the opponent, will be defeated in the case
 maamle se sweekrut sakshya ke aadhaar par hi nyaayalay vivaadaaspad daawey kii pariksha karata he evam jis paksh ko sakshya kii bahulata praapt hoti he, usee ke paksh main apana nirnay detaa he
 Often people buy land or other property in the name of others
 inhen 'benami' kehete hai
 The party which wants to declare 'benami' invalid from the court, is charged with the fact that the buyer is actually someone else and the person in whose name the property has been purchased is the buyer of the name only
 is prasang main kharid kii rakam kahan se ai, yah baat vishesh rup se vichaarneey hoti he
 In a civil case, if a party says that his case is based on a specified law, and that the general law of the country does not apply in his case, then he has to unquestionably certify the said law or the practice
 manahani ke maamalon main pramanbhaar vaadi par rahata he
 He has to first give evidence that he is not guilty for the stigma brought against him
 uske sakshya dene ke baad hi prativaadee is baat kaa pramaan de saktaa he ki usne shuddh bhaavana evam janhit kii drushti se hi vah baat kahi thi yaa likhi thi, jiske viruddh vaadi ne maamla kiya he
 If it is claimed on behalf of the government that a person has died without leaving an heir, so his property belongs to the government according to the law of 'eschat', then the government will be in charge that the last officer of the property died without leaving the heir
 
 yadi koi jaali check par kisi ko rupye de detaa he to bank par is baat kaa pramanbhaar hoga ki cheke babat uski ore se koi asaavadhaanee nahin hui
 In the claim of malicious case, the plaintiff has to prove that the defendant had prosecuted the plaintiff with malice and lack of reasonable cause
 yadi kisi stri kaa pati yah kahe ki uski stri duusare purush ke saath dushtacharan main thi to use hi stri ke dushtacharan ko pramanit karnaa hoga
 There is no such notion of law in Hindu legislation that the property of the family members is joint by having a joint family
 kintu yadi sweekaar kar liya jaay yaa pramanit ho jaay ki koi hindu parivaar sanyukt he tathaa sanyukt parivaar kii sampatti iske adheen he to is kram main kanoon kii prakalpana he ki sanyukt parivaar ke bhinn bhinn sadasyon ke adheen sadsy yadi vyaktigat rup main ukt sampatti kaa daawa karen to unhen hi pramaan dena padegaa ki sampatti unki apni he, sanyukt parivaar kii nahin
 If the execution of a document is certified, but it should be said that the document maker was deranged at the time the document was being written, then the document of the brain's malaise lies with the document maker
 yadi vah vyakti dastavej ke nishpaadan ke pehle veikshipt rahaa ho, par yah kaha jaay ki dastavej banane ke samay vah maansik santulan main tha, to iskaa pramanbhaar bhi usee par rahegaa
 If the execution of a document is deemed to be certified, but the subject matter mentioned in it is said to be untrue and fake that it was not intended to work accordingly, then the said accuser will bear the charge of this statement
 yadi registery kiye athwa na kiye hue kisi dastavej ko maamle main sweekaar kar liya jaay to is baat kaa pramanbhaar ki isamen pratifal nahin tha, dastavej banaanevaale par he
 The above general law applicable in the context of charge in civil cases has two options: dandabhiyog kii apil main pramanbhaar saadhaarant: maamla chalaanevaale par rahata he
 The court has to see whether the punishment awarded to the accused is correct
 yadi kisi aise nirnay ke viruddh apil ho, jahaan abhiyukt ko mukt kar diya gaya he, to vahaan maamla chalaanevaale par pramanbhaar kaa daayitv or bhi gurutar he
 The charge in the civil appeal lies with the appellant
 use hi pramanit karnaa padataa he ki apil ke antargat diya hua nirnay galat he
