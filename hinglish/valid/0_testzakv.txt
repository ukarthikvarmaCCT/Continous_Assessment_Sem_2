 In his initial monitoring, he named the "seas" and "continents" of Mars
 1877 main is grah kii "mahaan virodh" sthiti ke dauraan, unhone mangal kii sataha par raikhik sanrachanaon ke ghaney jaal dekhe, jise unhone italvi main "kanali" kaha, jiskaa arth angrezi main "channels" tha, lekin galat anuwaad se "canals" ban gaya
 Although the second term denotes artificial construction, the preceding term implies that it may also be the natural configuration of the land

 Among the most ardent proponents of these artificial canals was the famous American astronomer Percival Lovell, who spent much of his life proving the existence of intelligent-life on this red planet

 In his book, Life on Mars, Schaparelli writes that: "instead of the right channels we know, we should imagine trenches in the soil that are not deeper, 100 miles, 200 kilometers in a thousand miles straight direction or Be wider
 maine pehle hi bataaya he ki mangal grah par varsha ke abhaav main, sambhawatah ye channel hi pramukh rachana-tantra rahe hon jinke dwaara pani grah kii shushk sataha par fail saktaa he

 Chyavan, the son of Bhrigu Muni, was a great ascetic
 ek baar ve tap karne baithe to tap karte-karte unhen hajaaron varsh vyateet ho gayi
 Even termites and soil got covered in his body and the leaves covered his body
 unheen dinon raja sharyaati apni chaar hajaar raniyon or ekmaatr rupavati putree sukanya ke saath is van main aaye
 Sukanya, walking with her friends, came to Chyavan, doing penance covered with termites and mud and leaves
 usne dekha ki dimak-mitti ke tile main do gol-gol chhidr dikhaai pad rahe hai jo ki vastav main chyavan rishi kii ankhen thim
 Sukanya curiously buried the thorns in those holes
 kaanton ke gadate hi un chhidron se rudhir bahane laga
 Seeing whom Sukanya was frightened, she left quietly
 aankhon main kaante gad jane ke kaaran chyavan rishi andhe ho gayi
 He got very angry when he got blind and immediately cursed Shariati's army to stop stool and urine
 raja sharyaati ne is ghatana se atyant kshubdh hokar poocha ki kya kisi ne chyavan rishi ko kisi prakaar kaa ksht diya he? unke is prakaar poochne par sukanya ne sari baaten apane pita ko bataa di
 King Sharyati immediately approached the Chyavan Rishi and apologized
 chyavan rishi bole ki rajan! tumhaari kanya ne bhayankar aparaadh kiya he
 If you want to be free from my curse, then you have to marry your daughter with me
 is prakaar sukanya kaa vivaah chyavan rishi se ho gaya
 Sukanya was very devoted
 andhe chyavan rishi kii seva karte huye anek varsh vyateet ho gayi
 One day, Ashwanyakumar arrived at the Chyavan Rishi's ashram
 sukanya ne unka yathochit aadar-satkar evam pujan kiya
 Ashwanyakumar said, "kalyani! We are the doctors of the gods
 tumhaari seva se prasann hokar ham tumhaare pati kii aankhon main punah dipti pradaan kar unhen yauvan bhi pradaan kar rahe hai
 Tell your husband to go with us to the lake
 " chyavan rishi ko saath lekar donon ashwanikumaron ne sarovar main dubkee lagaai
 As soon as he took a dip, Chyavan Rishi's eyes were fixed and he became a youth like Ashwani Kumar
 unka rup-rang, akruti aadi bilkul ashwanikumaron jaisaa ho gaya
 He told Sukanya that Devi! You recognize your husband from us and take him to your ashram
 is par sukanya ne apni tej buddhi or pativrat dharm se apane pati ko pahchaan kar unka haath pakad liya
 Ashwani Kumar was very pleased with Sukanya's sharp intellect and pathetic religion and left them both after blessing them
 jab raja sharyaati ko chyavan rishi kii ankhen thik hone naye yauvan praapt karne kaa samachar mila to ve atyant prasann huye or unhone chyavan rishi se milakar unase yajna karaane kii baat kii
 Chyavan Rishi initiated him to the yajna
 us yajna main jab ashwanikumaron ko bhaag diya jane laga tab devraj indra ne aapatti kii ki ashwanikumar devataaon ke chikitsak hai, isaliye unhen yajna kaa bhaag lene kii paatrata nahin he
 But the Chyavan sage ignored the words of Indra and started giving Somaras to the Ashwani Kumaras
 isse krodhit hokar indra ne un par vajra kaa prahaar kiya lekin rishi ne apane tapobal se vajra ko bich main hi rokkar ek bhayanak rakshas utpann kar diya
 He ran to swallow the demon Indra
 indra ne bhaybheet hokar ashwanikumaron ko yajna kaa bhaag dena sweekaar kar liya or chyavan rishi ne us rakshas ko bhasma karke indra ko uske ksht se mukti dilaa di

 Dream interpretation is the process of giving meaning to dreams

 In modern times, various ideologies of psychology have presented theories about the meaning of dreams
 swapn vyakhya ke sarvaadhik puraane likhit udaahranon main se ek babylonia ke mahakavy apik of gilgamesh se miltaa he
 Gilgamesh dreamed that an ax fell from the sky
 log prashansa or puja main uske chaaron ore ekatra ho gaye the
 Gilgamesh threw the ax in front of his mother and then hugged her like a wife
 uski maa ninsun ne sapane kii vyakhya kii
 He said that soon a powerful will appear
 gilgamesh uske saath sangharsh karegaa or use parajeet karne kii koshish karegaa, lekin vah safal nahin hoga
 They would eventually become close friends and acquire great objects
 unhone joda, "tumne use ek patni kii tarah gale lagaaya tha, iskaa matlab yah he ki vah tumhen kabhi nahin chhodega
 us prakaar tumhaara sapana hal ho gaya he
 "while this example also shows a tendency to see dreams as prophetic, Ninsun's interpretation also holds a contemporary view
 lingeey or aakraamak, kulhada, ek purush kaa pratik he aarambh main aakraamak hoga lekin baad main mitra ke rup main parivartit ho jayega
 ek kulhaade kaa aalingan karnaa, aakraamakata ko sneh or sauhaard main parivartit karnaa he
 Priests in ancient Egypt also acted as dream interpreters
 yusuf or dainiel kaa parameshwar kii ore se bheje gaye sapanom kii vyakhya karne ke liye ullekh miltaa he or vastav main bible main sapanom kii anek ghatnaon kaa alokik rahasyodghatan ke rup main varnan he
 Hieroglyphics illustrate dreams and their explanations are clear
 adhiktar samskritiyon ke itihaas main sapanom kaa ullekhneey mahatva rahaa he
 Ancient Greeks built temples that they called asclepiones and in which sick people were sent for treatment
 yah mana jaataa tha ki ilaaj mandir kii simaaon ke andar sapane dekhne se daivi krupa dwaara prabhavi hoga
 Dreams were also considered prophetic or omen of special importance
 duusari shatabdi isvi main hue daldis ke artemidoras ne onirocritica sheershak se ek vishad granth likhaa tha
 Although Artemidorus believed that dreams could predict the future, he predicted many contemporary approaches to dreams
 usne sochaa ki ek sapane kii chhaviyon ke anek arth ho sakate the tathaa chhavi kaa uske ghatak shabdon main kutanuwaad karke use samajha ja saktaa tha
 While waging war against the Tyrians, Alexander dreamed that a satyr was dancing on his shield
 artemidoras likhte hai ki is sapane kii is prakaar vyakhya kii gai thi: sator = sa tiros, yah bhavishyavaanee karte hue ki alexander vijayi hoga
 Freud accepted this example of Artemidorus when he proposed that dream interpretation should be like a picture puzzle
 madhyayugin islamic manovigyaan main kuch haddees se sanket milte hai ki sapanom ke teen bhaag hote hai, aarambhik muslim vidwaanon ne bhi alag-alag teen prakaar ke sapanom: jhuthe sapane, rogakaarak sapane or or sachche sapane
 ebn sirin sapanom par likhi apni pustakon ta'bir al-rou'yaa tathaa muntakhab al-kalam fee tabir al-ehlaam ke liye prasiddh hue the
 From the manner of dream interpretation to the interpretation of the particular sura of the Quran in one's dream, this work on dream interpretation is divided into 25 sections, they write that it is important for the common man to seek the help of an alim who With the right understanding of cultural contexts and such reasons and interpretations can guide the interpretation of dreams
 al-kindi ne bhi sapanom kii vyakhya par on sleep and drims naamak granth likhaa tha
 In Consciousness Studies, al-farabi wrote a treatise on dreams, On the Cause of Dreams, which was included in the 24th chapter of his book Book of Opinions of the People of the Ideal City
 ve pehle vyakti the jinhone swapn vyakhya tathaa sapanom kii prakruti evam kaarnon main antar kiya
 In The Canon of Medicine, Avicenna expanded the theory of mood to include emotional aspects, mental capacity, moral tendencies, self-consciousness, activities and dreams
 ebn khaldoon kii mukaddimah kahati he ki "bhramit sapane" kalpana ke chitra hai jo grahabodh ke dwaara andar sangrahit hote hai tathaa vyakti ke indriya grahabodh se nivrutt ho jane ke baad, vichaar karne kii kshamta un par kaary karti he
 The standard is Lofty Principles of Dream Interpretation, a traditional Chinese book compiled by Chen Xiuan in the 16th century on dream-interpretation
 chini vichaarkon ne bhi swapn vyakhya ke bare main, yah prashn ki ham kaise jaanate hai ki ham sapana dekh rahe hai or kaise jaanate hai ki ham jaag rahe hai, jaise gahan vichaaron uthaaya tha
 It is written in Chuang-tzu: "once Chuang Chow dreamed that he was a butterfly
 vah khushi se idhar-udhar udata rahaa, jis sthiti main vah tha usase kaaphi prasann or vah chuang chau ke bare main kuch bhi nahin jaanata tha
 Now he wakes up and finds that he is Chuang Chow again
 ab chau sapana dekhtaa he ki vah titali tha yaa kya ab titali sapana dekhati he ki vah chau thi? yah aadhunik sangyanatmak tantrika vigyaan main ek atyant rochak vishay, vaastaviktaa nigaraanee kaa prashn uthaata he
 At the end of the 19th century, dream interpretation was taken as a part of psychoanalysis; If the known, revealed content of the dream is analyzed, then its invisible meaning comes to the mind of the dreamer
 is vishay par hue moulik kaaryon main se ek sigmund frid kii da interpritesan of drims he
 Template: Psychoanalysis yah unki pustak da interpritesan of drims jo pehali baar 1899 main prakashit hui thi main tha, ki sigmund frid ne pehali baar yah tark diya tha ki sabhi sapanom kii vishay-vastu kii prerana kamnapurti he or swapn dekhe jane kaa utprerak praayah swapn se pichley din kii ghatnaon main paaya ja saktaa he, jise unhone "diwas avshesh" kaha
 bahut chote bacchon ke maamle main frid ne daawa kiya, yah aasaani se dekha ja saktaa tha ki chote bachche sidhi tarah se pichley din unamem uthi ichchhaaon kii purti ko sapane main dekhte hai
 However, the situation is more complex in adults, in Freud's theory, adult dreams are deformed, with the so-called "manifest content" of dreams being a highly disguised derivative of latent dream-ideas present in the subconscious
 is virupan or prachhannata ke parinamswaroop swapn kaa vaastavik mahatva chupa rahata haih ek vatonmad kaa rogi apane vatonmad ke lakshanon se sambandh or unke mahatva ko jitna samajhataa he, spndrushtaa usase adhik apane sapane ke vaastavik arth ko pahchaanane main sakasham nahin hota
 In Freud's original formulation, latent dream-thinking was described as being subjected to an inner force called "censor"; However in later years in their more sophisticated terminology, the discussion used to be about parahams and "the work of the defense forces of ego"
 unhone mana ki jaagrath jivan main ye tathakthith "avrodh" avchetan kii damit ichchhaaon ko chetana main pravesh karne se purnatah roak dete hai; yadhyapi neend kii nimnatar avasthaa main ye icchhaaen kuch seemaa tak ubhar aane main safal ho jaati thi, avrodh abhi bhi itane shashakt hote the ki unki vaastavik prakruti ko chupaane ke liye "prachhannata kaa ek aavaran" utpann kar saken
 frid kaa drushtikon yah thi ki sapane to samjhaute hai jo yah sunushchit karte hai ki "damit ichchhaaon kii prachhann purti" se neend main vyavdhaan na aae, ve ichchhaaon kii purti kaa pratinidhitiv karne main safal hote hai jo anyathaa neend main vyavdhaan utpann kar ke swapndrushtaa ko jagaa sakate hai
 Freud's excellent early dream analysis is "injection of Irma": In this dream, a chronic patient of Freud complains of pain
 is sapana, frid ke sahyogi dwaara irma ko jeevanumukt kiye bina injection dete hue chitrit karata he
 Freud gives us pages of association with the elements of dreams, using it to demonstrate the technique of decoding the latent dream idea from the manifest content of dreams
 frid ne nimnlikhit shabdon main manovashleshik swapn-vishleshan kii vaastavik takanic kaa varnan kiya he: Freud listed the distortion processes that, he claimed, acted upon repressed desires and transformed them into recollected dreams: these distortions resulted in a very different form of the latent dream idea known by the manifest content analysis of dreams — these The latent content can be known by reversing the deformations
 prakriyaaon main shaamil hai: "secondary expansion" can also be added to it, as a result of the dreamer's natural tendency to create some kind of meaning or story from the various elements of the revealed theme

 Freud famously described psychoanalytic dream interpretation as "the royal road to the knowledge of the subliminal movements of the brain"; However, he was able to express regret and dissatisfaction with the way his views on the subject were improperly presented or not understood
 ek anya avasar par unhone kaha ki avyakt evam prakat vishaywastu ke bhed kii pahchaan karne main safal hone vaala vyakti ”sambhawatah unki pustak interpritesan of drims ke adhikash pathakon se aage tak chalaa gaya tha"
 Although not dismissing Freud's theory outright, Karl Yung considered Freud's theory to be unilateral and simplistic, describing dreams as representations of unquenchable desires
 Yung argued that Freud's process of associating with the dream would enter the mental state of the dreamer — a person's association with an object would reveal the mental state, as Yung showed by experiment - but not necessarily the dream Also get access to the meaning of
 Yung was convinced that the scope of dream interpretation was larger, reflecting the richness and complexities of the entire subconscious, including both individual and collective
 yung maanas ko ek aatm-viniyamit jeev maanate the jisamen sachetan pravritiyon kii kami kii achetan main vipareet pravritiyon dwaara purti kiye jane kii sambhaavna hoti he
 Yung proposed two basic approaches to the analysis of dream materials: objective and subjective
 In the objective view, each person in the dream refers to who he is: mother is mother, girlfriend is girlfriend, etc
 vyaktiparak drushtikon main, sapane main prayek vyakti swapndrushta ke ek pahalu kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Yung argued that it is more difficult for the dreamer to accept the subjective view, but in the best dream work, the dreamer will recognize that the characters in the dream can represent the undiscovered aspect of the dreamer
 is prakaar, yadi swapndrushtaa kaa ek pagal hatyare dwaara peechha kiya ja rahaa he, to antat swapndrushtaa pahchaan jayega ki yah us kaa swayan kaa hinsak aaveg tha
 Macroeconomicists have advanced the subjective view, claiming that inanimate objects in the dream can also represent aspects of the dreamer
 yung kaa maananaa tha ki aadyarup jaise vair-bhav, enema, chaaya tathaa anya sapanom main swayan ko swapn pratikon yaa akritiyon ke rup main prakat karte hai
 Such figures may take the form of an old man, a young maid, or a giant spider, as the case may be
 prayek ek achetan pravriti kaa pratinidhitiv karti he jo mukhya rup se chetan mastishk se chuphi rahati he
 Although they are an integral part of the dreamer's psyche, these disclosures were primarily autonomous and were perceived by the dreamer as an outsider
 in pratikon ke rup main prakat hue aadyarupon ke saath parichay, pratyaksh rup main maanas ke pruthak bhaagon kaa ekikaran karte hue tathaa samgr rup se khud ko samajhane kii prakriya main yogadan dete hue, vyakti kii achetan pravritiyon ke liye jaagarukta badhaata he, jise ve sarvopari maanate hai
 Yung believed that the material repressed by the conscious mind, according to Freud's postulate, makes the unconscious akin to their perception of their own shadow, which is in itself a small part of the unconscious
 yung ne aankh band karke graahak kii vyaktigat sthiti kii ek spasht samaj ke bina swapn pratikon ke arth bataane ke khilaaf chetavanee di
 He described two approaches to dream symbols: the causal approach and the final approach
 In the causal approach, symbols are reduced to certain fundamental tendencies
 is prakaar, ek talwaar ek ling kaa pratik he, to ek saanp kaa pratik bhi ho sakati he
 In the final approach, the dream interpreter asks, "why is this symbol and why not another?" Thus, a sword representing a penis is rigid, sharp, lifeless and destructive
 ek ling kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaala ek saanp sajiv he, khatarnaak he, shaayad jaharila or ghinauna he
 The final approach also tells you additional things about the dreamer's tendencies
 takneekee taur par, yung ne swapn ko anaavruth kar samast jaankaree kaa saar swapndrushtaa ko prastut karne kii sifarish kii
 This was a conversion of the process described by Wilhelm Stackel, who recommended the dream as understanding a newspaper article and writing a title on it
 harry stack sulivan ne bhi isi tarah kii prakriya "swapn aswan" kaa varnan kiya tha
 Although Yung accepted the universality of archetypal symbols, he opposed the notion of sign-images as having a connotation with one to its meaning
 unka drushtikon pratikon or unke uttaradaayi athon ke bich maujuud gatishalata or taralata ko pahchaanana tha
 Instead of adapting the dream to any predetermined idea, symbols should be searched for their importance to their patient
 yah swapn vishaleshan ko ek saidhantik or hathdharmi kasarat banane arthath marij kii swayan kii manovaigyanik avasthaa se dur hataa kar, roktaa he
 In the service of this idea, he emphasized the importance of 'sticking to the image' - the in-depth exploration of association with a particular image of the patient
 frid ke mukt saahchary ke vipareet unhone mana ki yah chhaviyon kii pramukhataa se vichlan tha
 For example, they described it as a "bargain table"
 ek swapndrushtaa se yah apeksha kii ja sakati he ki uskaa is chhavi ke saath kuch sambandh hoga, uskaa kisi prakaar ke mahatva se anbhigya hona yaa parichay kaa abhaav hona kisi ke bhi man main andeh utpann kar saktaa he
 Yung asked a patient to visualize the image as clearly as possible and then asked him to describe the image as if he didn't know what a "bargain table" was
 yung ne swapn vishleshan main sandarbh ke mahatv par bal diya
 Yung insisted that the dream was not a curved pellet whose deciphering meaning had to be understood, so the true causal factors behind it must be known
 sapane jhooth pakadaney kii mashin nahin the, jisase chetan vichaar prakriya ke peeche saath hosh main sochaa prakriyaaon ke peeche kii dhokhebaaji kaa khulaasa kiya ja sake
 Like the unconscious, dreams had their own language
 achetan ke pratinidhitiv ke rup main, swapn chhaviyon kii unki khud kii pradhanta or tark hai
 Jung believed that dreams could have unavoidable truths, philosophical declarations, illusions, uncontrolled fantasies, memories, plans, irrational experiences, even remote sensible scenes
 jaise maanas main ek prakashit paksh hota he jise ham chetan avasthaa main anubhav karte hai, iskaa ek andhera paksh bhi hota he jisaki ham swapn jaisi kalpanaaen karte hai
 Yung argued that we do not doubt the importance of our conscious experience, then we should not make predictions regarding the value of our unconscious life
 1953 main, kelvin es haul ne sapanom kaa ek siddhant viksit kiya jisamen swapn dekhne ko bhi ek sangyanatmak prakriya mana gaya
 Hall argued that a dream was simply a thought or thought series that occurred during sleep, dream images were personal when simply a thought sequence about an idea or idea that occurred during sleep, and dream images are visual representations of individual perceptions Are that For example, if one dreams that he has been attacked by friends, it may be a manifestation of fear of inferiority; a more complex example, which requires a cultural metaphor, is that a cat in the dream symbolizes that it needs to use its intuition
 angreji vaktaaon ke liye yah suzav diya gaya he ki ek swapndrushtaa ko pahchaanana chaiye ki dir ij "mor dain van ve tu skin e cat" yaa anya shabdon main, kisi kaary ko karne ke ek se adhik tareeke hote hai
 In the 1970s, Ann Faraday and others helped bring dream interpretation into the mainstream by publishing a book on do-it-yourself dream interpretation and forming groups to share and analyze dreams
 farade ne sapanom ke kisi ke jivan main hone vaali sthitiyon par samprayog par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 For example, some dreams may be warnings of an event going forward, such as a dream of failing the exam, a warning of not being prepared
 is tarah ke sandarbh ke baahar, iskaa sambandh kisi anya pariksha main asafal hone se ho saktaa he
 Or it may have a mucilaginous nature, such as one failing to examine any aspect of one's life
 farade ne likhaa ki "aadhunik shodh se ek baat dridhtaa se ubhari he ki bahusankhya aise sapanom kii he jo un baton ko pratibimbit karte hue lagate hai jo kisi tarah se pichley ek yaa do din pehle hamaare dimag main pehle se rahi thi
 In the 1980s and 1990s, Wallace Clift and Jean Delby Clift further explored the connection between images produced in dreams and the dreamer's waking life
 unki pustakon ne upachaaratmakataa evam swasthya kii ore jane par vishesh jor dete hue sapanom main pattern kii pahchaan kii tathaa jivan ke parivartanon kii khoj hetu sapanom ke vishleshn ke tareekon kii pahchaan kii
 Two researchers have assumed that dreams are biological actions, where the material does not require any analysis or interpretation, that material reinforces an automatic stimulation of the body's bodily functions and spontaneous human behavior
 isliye sapane maanav, pashu, astitv or vikaas kii ranneeti ke hisse hai
 Professor Antti Rinonsuo had confined his thoughts to fear rehearsal, where dreams exercise our primary instincts of self-defense, and he asserts this argument strongly in several publications
 kith stevens ne is siddhant kaa sabhi maanviya pravritiyon ke liye vistaar kiya he, jisamen shaamil hai khud ko khatra, parivaar ke sadasyon ko khatra, jodon kaa bandhan or prajnan, jigyaasa or chunautiyon tathaa vyaktigat shreshthata or adivasee sthiti ke liye abhiyaan
 unhone 22000 internet prastutiyaan main se ek namoonay kaa nau shreniyon main vargeekaran kiya he or sapana saamagree tathaa pravriti purvaabhyas kii saarvbhaumik samanta kaa pradarshan kiya he
 It is assumed that the action of the dream is automatic, in response to the material, acting and stimulating body chemistry, and neurological activities will also be involved if the scenario occurs in real life, in order to achieve the goal of the dream
 There is no need to remember
 yah tark diya gaya he ki, ek baar ek swapndrushtaa ne sapane main ek khatre kaa anubhav kiya, isse uski vaastavik jivan main khatre kaa saamana karne kii kshamta bad gai, atah aise sapane, manushyon or jaanwaron donon main astitv ke liye sahaayak hote hai
 The prediction of the threat may be specific, for example, an attack by a wild dog, but it can also be common, in which case the physical response to the threat is activated and reinforced while dreaming
 maanav prajnan ke sambandh main yah siddhant kahata he ki jode bananaa, sambandh or sahavaas prajati kii punarutpatti ke prati utprerit karte hai, sarvshereshth saathi dhundne or ishtatam anuvanshik mishran praapt karne kii prayek vyakti mahatvakanksha kii purti hetu un sapanom par jor dete hai jo chayan ke siddhant ko protsaahit karte hai
 In this context, dream work is contrary to human moral values of loyalty and cohabitation for life
 vishesh rup se, yuva mahilaayein aksar garbhvatee hone or bachche ko janm dene ke sapane dekhati hai, atyant sakaaratmak sapane jo sidhe prajnan hetu protsaahit karte hai
 Regarding status, dreams are believed to be related to superiority or inferiority, either by positive life patterns of success or by negative lifestyles of failure, triggering the dreamer's determination to improve its status in the immediate human sequence
 isliye, aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki sapane pratisparddha tathaa vaataavaran ke liye sarvaadhik upyukt logon kii prajnan safalataa ko protsaahan dete hai
 Finally, other dreams stimulate the determination to search and inquire through the extremes of blissful dream achievements or frustrating obstacles and barriers
 baad vaale sapane is sankalp ko badhaava dete hai ki apni ichchhaaon ke pariprekshya main hamen haar nahin manani he, taaki vyakti or prajatiyaan jivan main aage bad saken
 sapana dekhne vaale africa barasinghe ke liye pahari ke upar ek haraa-bharaa charaagaah ho saktaa he, kisi maanviya swapndrushtaa ke liye ek parmaanu ko vibhajit karnaa ho saktaa he
 People who are engaged in dream interpretation work "now and then or often" and those who "never or never" seem to have done very little comparison of symptoms
 maaikel themborn ke praarambhik aprakashit anusandhan se pataa chalata he ki jaadui vichaaron, kaalpanik rujhaan tathaa apasaamaanya vishwaas par "swapn vyakhyakaaron" ko adhik ank mili hai
 It remains unknown whether these criteria are set for dream interpreters now and then or often for dream interpreters, or include psychoanalytic therapists

 The literary genre that the Baran poets of Rajasthan used for their songs is called dingle or dingle
 vaise chaaran kaviyon ke atirikt prithiraj jaise anya kaviyon ne bhi dingal style main rachana kii he
 Bhatt poets of Rajasthan have been writing in "pingal" without taking shelter from "dingle"
 kuch vidvan "dingal" or "rajasthani" ko ek duusare kaa paryaayavachi maanate hai, kintu yah mat bhashashastreey drushti se trutipurna he
 In this way, it is unscientific to consider the works of Dalpati Vijay, Narpati Nalh, Bardai and Nallasingh Bhat in "dingle" literature

 Prominent poets of "dingle" are Badar, Prithiraj, Isardas, Dursa Ji Adha, Karanidan Kavia, Mancharam Sevak, Bankidas Asiya, Kishan Ji Adha, Mixture poet Suryamall and Maharaja Chatursinghji

 The word "dingle" means irregular or lost degree

 2
 Earlier the language of Marudesh was called "dougal", later on the weight of "pingle" it came to be called "dingle"
 3
 'da' varnabahula hone ke kaaran ise "dingal" kaha jaataa he 
 4
 On the analogy of the sound of the dum degree, this language style of ojogunapratur heroic verses is called "dingle"

 According to him, the word "deangal", which is its actual form, is formed by the sum of the selfish suffix "l" with the word brag

 The sound and grammar of Dingle correspond to those of Marwari or Western Rajasthani, but its dictionary is replete with a number of Tadbhav, Ardhatsam and Indigenous words, which are not found to behave in the same way
