 radio sangrahi ek vidyut paripath he jo vidyutchumbakeey tarangon ke rup main uplabdh sanketon ko antena ke dwaara grahan karne ke baad iskaa samyak prasanskaran karte hue ant main dhwani yaa kisi anya upyogi rup main prastut karata he
 The study of the production and properties of radio waves was first attempted by Heinrich Hertz in 1887
 apane itihaas prasiddh prayog main radio tarangon ke utpaadan kii vyavastha dwaara utpann tarangon ko unhone swayan hi sphulingon ke rup main do ghundiyon ke bich praapt kiya tha jo taar ke ek fande ke donon siron par sthit thim
 This early experiment by Herts indicated the possibility of eclipsing modes of radio waves, on the basis of which Oliver Lodge built a special type of detector in England in 1894, which transformed radio waves into waves of audio frequency

 This detector was built with an antenna and an integrated circuit to form the first radio receiver
 is prakaar betaar sanchaar pranali ke sangrahi ghatak kii pariklpana karne or uskaa pratham upyogi rup prastut karne kaa shrey oliver loj ko hi he
 Lodge successfully built and patented the first radio satellite by this special arrangement
 loj kii safalataa se protsaahit hokar anek vaigyanikon ne nae nae sansuchakon kaa nirmaan kiya
 Among these, Gualielmo Marconi made magnetic-type detectors, Vryland and Fesden created electronegative types, and Lee de Forest created active electronegative types

 Fleming heralded a new chapter in the history of the development of radio communication systems, creating bipolar walls
 sansuchak ke rup main in vaalvon ke upyog ne anek kathinaaiyon evam samasyaon kaa niraakaran kar diya
 In about a year of this, Anant Lee de Forest created a revolution in the field of electronic and radio communication systems by the implementation of triode valves
 ye valve tathaa inke anek sanshodhit roopon yatha tetrod evam pentod aadi vaalvon ko hi radio sanchaar pranali ko aadhunik rup tak pahunchaane kaa shrey diya ja saktaa he
 The amplifiers, detectors and vibrators that make the integrated circuits are designed with the help of these valves
 radio sanchaar pranali kaa vah ang jo arial tak nirantar pahunchaanevaali radio aavriti urja se vaanchit ansh pruthak kar grahan karata he, radio sangrahi kehalaata he
 All types of radio collectors basically have to do the following: antena par nirantar anek prakaar ke radio sanket pahonchte rahete hai, jo sansar ke vibhinn bhaagon main sthit preshan kendron se preshit hote hai
 The organizer should have an appropriate arrangement that he can at any moment select a particular sign, separate it from other signs and receive it

 The values of the inductors and capacitors in this circuit are adjusted so that the frequency of the circuit is equal to the frequency of the acceptor signal
 us dasha main paripath ko ukt sanket ke liye samaswarit kehete hai
 The values of the inexact inductances and capacitors are determined according to the following formula: jahaan prerak kaa prerakatv, sandharitra kii dharita tathaa grahya sanket aavriti he
 Thus the converged circuit selects only signals of the same frequency that are equal to its frequency, sorting the remainder apart
 achche sangrahi sanyantron main aise kai paripath shrenee kram main sanyojit kiye hue hote hai jinase sangrahi kii varanshiltaa, yaa varanshakti paryaapt rup se sanvardhit ho jaati he
 Radio signals received from antennas are extremely weak
 is kaaran ve laudspikar ko kriyanvit kar sakane main asamarth rahete hai
 Therefore, the ability to sufficiently amplify their power should be in the company of the Sangrahi
 etdarth usamen pravardhan vyavastha sanyukt hoti he
 The signal waves coming from the sending centers to the antenna's antennas are of very high frequency
 isliye sangrahi main pravisht hone ke pashchaat inhen shravyavritiyon main parinat karnaa aavashyak hota he
 It is possible to isolate these audiovisuals and hear the signal only after inserting it into the sound amplifier
 The system used to convert radio waves into sound waves is called a detector device
 sansuchak se nisruth shravyavriti sanketon kii shakti atyant ksheen hoti he, jisase vah laudspikar ko kriyanvit kar sakane main aksham rahati he
 Therefore, it is necessary to amplify it in sufficient quantity before entering the loudspeaker
 is hetu prayukt vyavastha ko shravyavriti pravardhak kehete hai
 a loudspeaker or shirafone is also a key part of the vibrating set to convert audiovisual signals from electricity to sound
 ise samaswarit radio aavriti sangrahi bhi kehete hai
 This receiver is tuned to particular radio frequencies
 iske andar sanvisht sabhi paripath vaanchit radio aavruti ke liye yaa to mulat: samaswarit rahete hai, yaa unke saath aisi vyavastha sambhddha rahati he ki aavriti vishesh ke liye sabko ek saath samaswarit kar diya jaae
 In such an old-fashioned convector, each such circuit had a separate capacitor capacitor, but in modern sets all circuits are combined with the same variable, or variable capacitor, in such a way that the capacitor is assumed to have different capacitance when it is rotated
 Different circuits are connected to

 bharat main buddha dharm kaa janm isa purv 6 ve shatabdi ko hua tha kintu kalkram main bharat se buddha dharm lagbhag samaapt ho gaya jabaki vishwa ke anya bhaagon main buddha dharm kaa prasar evam vikaas hota rahaa
 Buddhism continued to develop as a state religion starting from the 6th century BCE, until the empire of Emperor Ashoka
 vah samast bharat main hi nahin- china, japan,syam, lanka, afghanistan singapore or asia ke pashchimi deshon tak fail gaya
 History like Emperor Ashoka After the famous Kalinga war, after the Kalinga war, he became Buddhist on his Buddhism
 kuch vidwano kaa yah bhi kaha he ki buddha dharm ke bhikshuon kaa naitik aacharan gir jane ke kaaran hi buddha dharm kaa patan hua he kintu yah satya nahin he
 Every religion starts with good objectives, but later there is a kind of misunderstanding in it, like it happened with Buddhism too
 kintu keval yah kaaran hi paryaapt nahin he
 The Buddhist period has not only seen a period of great development but has also seen a strong first central authority
 is kaal main bharatvarsh aadhyatm evam gyaan kaa kendra ban gaya tha
 Due to the rapid expansion of Buddhism, economic development was also very much apart from religious and political at that time
 bharat main buddha dharm ke patan ke anek kaaran ginaye jate hai
 According to some scholars, the reason for the disappearance of Buddhism from India was 'opposition to Brahmins'
 buddha dharm ke purv bramhan vaidic dharm kaa paalan karte the at buddha dharm kaa aagaman ek prakaar se bramhan dharm ke virudhd ek kranti thi
 In the Mauryan period, Emperor Ashoka had made Buddhism his religion, so according to its conduct, Vedic Balipatha was banned which greatly expanded Buddhism
 pratikranthiswarup baad ke shung shaasha ne ise phir se prarambh karvaa diya tha
 Devanapriya Ashoka had built around 84000 thousand stupas in Jambudvip, in which Saatchi, Sarnath Etiadi
 pushyamitra shung ko buddhisto se shatruta rakhanevaala manajata he jisane budhdisto ke shaastra jalaae tathaa bhikshuon kaa narasanhar kiya
 After recounting the consequences of their mistake, the Brahmins resurrected them and began to explain the things of Buddhism in their scriptures and started teaching them to their followers
 " buddha- dharm kaa muqabla karne ke liye hindu dharm ke vidwaanon ne pracheen karmkandake sthaan par gyaan- maarg or bhakthi- maarg kaa prachaar karnaa aarambh kiya
 Scholars like Kumaril Bhatt and Shankaracharya suppressed the philosophy of Buddhism by rendering philosophies like Mimamsa and Vedanta, and Vaishnava doctrines like Ramanuja, Vishnu Swami, etc
 The Vaishnava doctrines of Buddhism by devotion-path surpassed the religion and made a small person even more influential
 Publicized the legislation giving inner space
 saath hi anek hindu raja bhi in dharm- prachaarkon kii sahaytarth khadey ho gaye
 The result of all this is that as Buddhism suddenly grew bigger and spread throughout the country, when it began to weaken, it did not take long to erode
 iske antargat madhya asia se aaye shwet hun tathaa mongol, muslim shaasha mohammad bin kasim, mehmud gaznavi tathaa mohmmad gauri ityadi ko mana ja saktaa he
 Buddhism also suffered from the attacks of the White Huns and Mongols coming from the northern east part of India
 mohammad bin kasim kaa sindh par akraman karne se bharatiyo kaa pehali bar islam se parichay hua
 Since Dahir, the ruler of Sindh, was an unpopular ruler ruling over Buddhist subjects, Muhammad was defeated by King Dahir
 mehmud gaznavi ne 10 ve shatabdi isvi main buddhistha evam bramhan dono dharmo ke dharmik sthalo ko toda evam sampurn punjab kshesso par kabja kar liya
 In this way, many Buddhists fled to Nepal and Tibet

 aaj buddha dharm anek doorvarti deshon main failaa hua he or jiske anuyaayiyon kii sankhya vishwa main tisare sthaan par he kintu bharat main adhikansh anya dharm waalon se bahut kam ho gayi he
 Its disappearance from India in this way has been very unfortunate
 log buddha dharm ko purna rup se ek videshi- dharm hi maanane lage the kintu 14 aktubar 1956 ko dalito ke netaa da
bhimrao ambedkar ne hindu dharm main vyaapt chhuachhut se taki aakar apane lagbhag 10 lakh anuyaayio ke saath bharat ke is pracheen evam samanta par aadhaarit dharm ko apanaakar, buddha dharm ko punah uski usee janmbhumi par punerjeevit kar diya he tathaa aaj maharastra, uttar pradesh evam deshbhar ke dalit buddha dharm ko maananevaale ban gayi hai
 From this discussion, we come to the conclusion that all the major religions of the world have been established with the objective of achieving high values by removing people from low-level biological values
 parsi, yahudee, isai, islam aadi majahab aaj chaahe jis dasha main hon par aarambh main sabane apane anuyaayiyon ko jivan ke shreshth mulyo par chalaakar unka kalyaan saadhan hi kiya tha
 But due to the self-interest of some individuals or a particular community in all, disorders arose and then began to decline
 tab phir kinhin vyaktiyon ke hriday main apane dharm kii duravastha kaa khyaal aayaa or ve logon ko galat tathaa hanikaarak maarg se hataakar dharm- sanskaar kaa praytn karne lage
 The Buddha also understood this and therefore it was arranged that after every hundred years a large gathering of Buddhist representatives from all over the world should be held and remove the faults that came to be known by fully considering their religion and the condition of the religious people
 And new time-use rules should be introduced
 is uddeshy kii siddhi ke liye agar aavashyak samajha jaae to puraani prathaon or niyamon se kuch choti-moti baton ko chhoda or badla ja saktaa he
 As a result of the Buddhist religious leaders following this wise system and avoiding orthodoxy, Buddhism continued to grow for several hundred years and the residents of the distant countries of the world earnestly came to this country and received their education and preached it among themselves
 jivit or lok- kalyaan kii bhaavana se anupranit dharm kaa yahi lakshan he ki vah nirarthak yaa desh- kaal ke pratikul reeti- rivaajon ke paalan kaa pracheenta yaa parampara ke naam par vah aagrah nahin karata
 But always keeps self-inspection and if for any reason any evil, harmful practices and rules have arisen in their religion, in their society, in their caste, then they do not follow them in abandoning and correcting them
 isliye buddha kii sabase bady shiksha yahi he ki-manushyon ko apana dharmik, saamaajik aacharan sadaiv kalyankari or samyaanukool niyamon par aadhaarit rakhana chahie
 The society, religion which always keeps away its faults and disorders, should be considered as 'jivit' and they achieve success and high rank in the world
 vartmaan samay main hindu dharm main jo sabase bady truti utpann ho gai he
 That is, it has completely abandoned the tendency of self-inspection and has considered the continuance of 'the stereotypes' as a major feature of religion
 adhikansh logon kaa drushtikon to aisa simit ho gaya he ki ve kisi atyant saadhaaran pratha- parampara ko bhi, jo inhen sau-do sau varshon main kisi karanvash prachlit ho gai he
 But nowadays it is clearly proving to be the opposite of time and harmful, leaving it is considered 'anti-religion'

 If we understand this fact and in the name of tradition and traditions, the garbage has been filled in our society

 He was one of the greatest winners of history
 uske saamne koi ruk nahin paa rahaa tha

 Napoleon was born on 15 August 1769 AD in Ajaxi, the following year of the reunification of Carcica and France
 uske pita charles bonapart ek chirkaalin kuleen parivaar ke the
 Their lineage is said to be from the Tuscany region of Italy adjacent to Carcica
 charles bonapart french darbar main carsika kaa pratinidhitiv karte the
 He was married to an aristocratic beauty named Leticia Remolino, who was born Napoleon
 charles ne french shashan ke viruddh carsican vidroh main bhaag bhi liya tha, kintu antat: french shakti se samya sthapit karnaa hi shreyaskar samajha
 By the grace of the French Governor Marbiff, he also had the opportunity to join a consultation in Versailles
 charles ke saath uski dwitiya putr napolian bhi tha
 Inspired by the bright future that his personality indicated, the French authorities offered Breen a scholarship to study at the military academy and received his education there from 1779 to 1784
 taduparant paris ke sainik skool main use apana topakhane sambandhi gyaan pusht karne kaa avasar lagbhag ek varsh tak mila
 Thus Napoleon's childhood was spent in the French environment
 balyavastha main hi saare parivaar ke bharan poshan kaa uttardaayitv komal kandhon par pad jane ke kaaran use vaataavaran kii jatilta evam uske anusaar vyavhaar karne kii kushalta mil gai thi
 Therefore, his entry into the French Revolution was indicative of epoch-making events
 france ke vibhinn virgon se sampark sthapit karne main use koi sankoch yaa hichkichaahat nahin thi
 He also entered the Jacobin contingent and was introduced to events directly on the occasion of Tuileri's right on 20 June
 france ke rajtantr kii durdasha kaa bhi use purna gyaan ho gaya tha
 This is where the huge personality of Napoleon emerges
 napolian ke udai tak french kranti purna araajaktaa main parivartit ho chuki thi
 The 'reign of terror' was conducted as a result of the rivalry and disharmony of the Jacobin and Girndist parties, in which all the revolutionaries, even Rabspier himself, were killed one by one
 1793 i main tulaan ke ghere main napolian ko pratham baar apana shaury evam kalapradarshan kaa avasar mila tha
 Bairas, a prominent ruler of the directory, was attracted by his talent
 phir 1795 main jab bheed kanrveshan ko hui thi, to directory dwaara vishesh rup se ayukta hone par napolian ne kushaltapurvak kanvension kii raksha kii or samvidhan ko hone diya
 These successes drew the attention of all France to Napoleon and the directory gave him the lead in the Italian campaign
 ek saptaah pashchaat usne jojephin se vivaah kiya or taduparant apni sena sahit italy main pravesh kiya
 The Italian campaign was a vivid example of Napoleon's military and administrative ability
 is baat kii ghoshnaa purv hi kar di gai thi ki french sena italy ko austria kii daastaa se mukt karaane aa gayi he
 He severed ties with Austria by defeating the enemy at the first three places
 tab sardenia ko yudhviram karne ke liye vivash kar diya
 He then received Milan in Lodi's place
 revoli ke yuddh main mentua ko samarpan karnaa padaa
 Archduke Charles also had to submit the treaty and the Luban agreement was reached
 in saare yudhon or vaartaon main napolian ne paris se kisi prakaar kaa aadesh nahin liya
 The Pope also had to make a treaty
 lombardi ko sisalpine tathaa jinoa ko ligurian ganatantr main parivartit kar french namoonay par ek vidhaan diya
 These successes caused Austria to lose its footing and had to turn to Napoleon for the Treaty of Campo Fermi, and in this complex situation, Austria had to withdraw its hand from its Bellary territories and from the Rhine frontiers and Lombardy
 napolian ke in yudhon se tathaa chote rajyon ko samaapt kar vrihat ikai main parivartit karne ke kaaryon se, italy main ek rashtriya andolan khadaa hua jo itihaas main risorgimento ke naam se prasiddh he
 On his return from the Italian expedition, Napoleon received a grand welcome
 directory bhi bhaybheet ho gai tathaa napolian ko france se dur rakhane kaa upaay sochane lagi
 At this time, the rival of France was left only to Britain
 napolian ne britain ko haraane ke liye uske samrajya par kutharaghaat na karnaa uchit samajha tathaa apni misr-abhiyaan-yojana rakhi
 The directory immediately accepted him
 1798 i main bonapart ne misr ke liye prasthaan kiya
 The plan of ending the eastern kingdom of Britain through Egypt instead of making a direct attack on Britain seemed compatible with the French rulers
 mimluk turki se iskaa saamana paramid ke tathakthith yuddh main hua
 But the Mediterranean president of the British Navy was chasing Commander Nelson Napoleon efficiently
 usne aage badhkar francisiyon ko nil nadi ke yuddh main teetar-bitar kar diya tathaa turki ko bhi englad kii ore se yuddh main pravesh karne ke liye vivash kar diya
 Nelson's success gave Britain the opportunity to form a second bloc, and the nations of Europe, which Napoleon had suppressed, began preparing for a campaign against France
 turki ke yuddh main pravisht ho jane par napolian ne syria kaa abhiyaan chhedaa
 With only a limited contingent of thirteen thousand marched towards Acker but stopped by a skilled fighter like Sidney Smith
 yah napolian ke liye vardaan siddh hua
 Now Napoleon was involved in the creation of another French empire in Syria
 kintu france is samay ek najuk sthiti se guzar rahaa tha
 Therefore, Napoleon considered it desirable to appear in France, despite being successful in establishing his power in Egypt
 napolian ke france main pravesh karte hi halchal paidaa ho gai
 Finding a favorable environment, in November 1799, Napoleon seized power and disbanded the directory and enacted a new legislation
 is vidhaan ke anusaar teen kaunsal niyukt hue
 After some time all the powers were concentrated in the first Council Napoleon
 france ek deergh ashaanti se thak chukaa tha tathaa kranti ko sthapitv kii ore le jane ke liye antarkalin shanti param aavashyak thi
 But before the peace was established, an Italian campaign was necessary to defeat Austria
 napolian ne 1800 i main italy kaa doosraa abhiyaan basant ritu main prarambh kiya tathaa merengo kii vijay praapt kar austria ko lunvil kii sandhi ke liye vivash kar diya, jisamen pehle kii campoformiyon kii sari sharten doharaai gai
 Now the second bloc broke out and Napoleon made a treaty of Amiens from England in 1801 AD, under which the two nations returned each other's conquered territories
 ab nepolian ne ek sudhaar yojana karyanvit kar france ko shashan or vyavastha di
 Disciplined the economic condition of France
 shiksha paddati main abhootpurv parivartan kiye
 Strengthened the land system
 paris kaa saundaryikaran kiya
 Made considerable changes in the army and gave a scientific basis to the French system, which is still known as the Napoleonic Code
 pope se ek con courdet kar catholic jagat kaa samarthan praapt kar liya
 Napoleon achieved considerable success with these reforms and in March 1804 he became the Emperor of France
 is ghatana se saare europe main ek halchal paidaa hui
 Again the war between France and Britain began to cloud
 napolian ne england par akraman karne ke liye uttari samudri tat par bolon main apni sena bheji
 England awakened to the north of its naval contingent on the English Channel and then surprised Napoleon at every encounter
 aamiain kii sandhi ke samaapt hote hi wiliam pit shashan main aayaa or usne england, austria, yas aadi rashtron ko milakar ek tritiy gut banaaya
 Napoleon then barricaded against Austria and ended the Republic of Sisalpine and assumed the position of King of Italy himself
 austria ko ulm ke yuddh main haraaya
 Francis, the ruler of Austria, fled and took refuge in the Tsar
 idhar trafalgar ke yuddh main nelson ne napolian kii jalsena ko haraa diya tha, jisase austria ko phir se napolian ko chunauti dene kaa mauka mil gaya tha
 But when Austerlitz was defeated in the war, Austria had to accept a shameful treaty of the press class
 is safalataa se napolian kaa ullas bad gaya or ab usne germany ko raudna prarambh kiya
 He strengthened the rule of his brother Joseph Bonaparte by creating the Treaty of Rhine, defeating the wars of Jena and Arsed in 14 October 1806
 ab keval rus rah gaya jise napolian ne june 1807 i main freedland ke yuddh main haraakar july 1807 kii tilsit kii sandhi ke liye vivash kiya
 Once the master of all Europe, Napoleon waged an economic war to defeat England
 saare europe ke rashtron kaa vyapaar england se band kar diya tathaa europe kii sari seemaa par ek kathor niyantran lagu kiya
 Britain promulgated a prohibitive command to stop France's trade with the nations of Europe to its north
 britain ne apni kshatipurti upaneveshon se vyapaar badha kar kar lee, kintu europea rashtron kii aarthik sthiti bigadane lagi or ve france kii is yatnaa se peedit ho uthe
 Spain first revolted against this system
 parinamswaroop napolian ne spain par chadhaai kii or vahaan kii satta chin lee
 This sparked a national uprising in Spain
 nepolian isko dabaa bhi nahin paaya tha ki use austria ke vidroh ko dabaanaa padaa or phir kram se prasha or rus ne bhi is vyavastha kii avagya kii
 Russia's rebellion proved disastrous for Napoleon
 uske moscow abhiyaan kii barbaadi itihaas main prasiddh ho gayi he
 Upon returning to Paris, Napoleon again collected an army, but was again defeated at Leipzig by the united armies of Prussia, Russia and Austria
 chaaron ore rashtriya sangram chhid jane se vah sakriy rup se kisi ek raashtra ko na dabaa sakaa tathaa 1814 i main alba dweep bhej diya gaya
 The Allied forces were not able to return even after it was reported that Napoleon's century-long rule began
 at: mitra rashtron ne use 1815 main waterlu ke yuddh main haraakar saint helena kaa karawas diya
 He died there on May 5 in 1821
 nepolian bonapart ne 1799 main satta ko haathon main lekar apni sthiti sudrudh karne tathaa france ko prashasnic sthayitv pradaan karne ke liye vibhinn kshetron main sudhaar kiye
 In fact, the Nepalese had taken over power by ending the rule of the directory and the people of France had accepted that change, then the reason was that it had grown from chaos and chaos
 atah nepolian ke liye yah jaruri tha ki vah aantarik kshetra main ek suvyavasthit shashan or kanoon vyavastha kii sthapana kare
 After becoming First Counsel, Napoleon created a new Constitution for France which was the fourth constitution of the Revolution era
 iske dwaara karypalika shakti teen kanusalaron main nihit kar di gai
 The Principal Counsel had more power than other Counselors
 vastav main samvidhan main ganatantr kaa dikhaaya to jarur tha lekin rajya kii sampoorn satta nepalian ke haathon main kendrit thi
 Napoleon centralized the governance and abolished the local governments of the Departments and Districts and appointed the prefects and sub-prefects
 inaki niyukti tathaa gaanv or shaharon ke sabhi meyaron kii niyukti sidhe kenndriya sarkaar dwaara kii jane lagi
 In this way, Napoleon, the administration's field, kept adequate control over these officers and kept the administration in order and appointed them on the basis of merit
 prashasnic kshetron main nepolian ke sudhaar ek prakaar se kranti ke virdohi ke rup main the kyonki neshnal essembali ne kranti ke dauraan prashasnic dhaanche kaa purna vikendrikaran kar diya tha tathaa desh kaa shashan chalaane kaa daayitv nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ko diya gaya tha lekin nepalian ne is vyavastha ko ulat diya or krantipurv vyavastha ko phir se sthapit kiya
 From that point of view he was a laughingstock of revolution
 nepolian ne france kii jarjar aarthik sthiti se use ubaarane kaa praytn kiya
 In this sequence, he first simplified the tax system
 kar vasuulne kaa kaary kendriya karmchaariyon ke jimme kiya tathaa uski vasuuli sakhti se kii jane lagi
 He prohibited unfair profits in bribery, betting, contracting
 usne mitvyayita par bal diya or france kii janata par anek apratyaksh kar lagaae
 Napoleon established the Bank of France to carry out the financial activities in France, which still exists today
 rashtriya rin ko chukaane ke liye usne ek pruthak kosh kii bhi sthapana kii
 As far as possible Napoleon put the burden of military expenditure on the conquered territories and tried to keep the French people free from this burden
 nepolian ne krishi ke sudhaar par bhi bal diya or banjar or retile ilaake ko upjau banane kii yojana banaai
 Napoleon paid considerable attention to the means of transport for the development of trade
 sadaken, naharen banavaai gai vibhinn prakaar ke vyavsaayon kii pragati ke liye yantric shiksha kii vyavastha kii
 To popularize French industrial goods, encouraged the exhibition and encouraged indigenous goods and industries
 berogari kii samasya ko dur karne ke liye nirmaan kaary ko protsaahan diya
 In this way Napoleon recovered France from a state of shabby and insolvency
 kintu aarthik sudhaaron kii drushti se bhi nepolian ke kaary kranti virdohi dikhaai dete hai
 In the Revolution, emphasis was placed on direct taxes, while Napoleon tried to establish an archaic system by emphasizing indirect taxes
 isi prakaar nepolian ne vanijyivaadee darshan ko praathamikta dekar krantivirdohi maansikta kaa pradarshan kiya
 He believed that the state would have to take active intervention to bring balance between the security of the fund and trade, whereas the force of revolution was on free trade
 nepalian aise nagarikon ko chahta tha jo uske evam uske tantra ke prati vishwaas rakhe
 For this, he made reforms by adopting national and secular forms of education
 shiksha ko praathmik, madhyamik or ucch staron par sangathit kiya
 These schools run with the help of teachers appointed by the government, used to have the same curriculum, the same textbooks and the same uniform
 nepolian ne paris main ek vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana kii or usamen latin, french, vigyaan, ganit ityadi vishyon kii shiksha di jaati thi
 This university was not a university in the general sense of the university, but made a system that tied all the institutions from primary to higher education together
 shiksha par adhikadhik sarkari niyantran rakhana tathaa vidhyaarthiyon ko shashan ke prati nishthavan bananaa iskaa uddeshy tha
 Napoleon founded the Institute of France for research work
 nepolian kii nari shiksha main koi ruchi nahin dikhaai
 The burden of their education was left to religious institutions
 france kii bahusankhyak janata catholic carch ke prabhaav main thi
 During the revolution, the power of the church was weakened and brought under the kingdom
 carch kii sampati kaa rashtriyakaran kar diya gaya or padariyon ko rajya kii vafadari kii shapath lene ko kaha gaya
 This angered the Pope and incited the general public to protest
 faltah sarkaar or aamajanata ke bich tanaav paidaa ho gaya
 Napoleon made a pact with the Pope from 1801 called Concardate to overcome it
 uske nimnlikhit praavdhaan the
 Napoleon's most important and permanent work was the creation of the Code of Law
 vastutah kranti ke pehle france kii kanoon vyavastha chhin-bhinn thi or itane prakaar ke kanoon the ki kanoon kaa paalan karaane waalon ko bhi unka gyaan nahin tha or kranti ke dauraan bhi yah araajaktaa bad gai thi
 Napoleon overcame this chaos
 swayan nepolian apni vidhi samhita ko apane 40 yudhon se adhik shaktishaalee maanata tha
 By this code Napoleon established the universal law system in France
 naagarik samhita ke tahat usne parivaar ke mukhiya kaa adhikaar sudrudh kiya
 Women are placed under men and the husband's job is to protect the wife
 talaak kii paddati ko kathin banaaya gaya
 Civil marriage was also arranged in this code
 is prakaar civil vivaah or talaak kii pratha ko manyata dekar nepolian ne europe main is baat kaa prachlan kiya ki bina padariyon ke sahyog ke bhi samaaj kaa kaam chal saktaa he
 Thus other codes such as the Code of Criminal Proc
 Etc
 were created
 uske vyapaarik code main shramjiviyon ke hiton kii upeksha kii gai thi or unke sanghon par pratibandh ko jari rakhaa gaya tha
 In this view Napoleon worked against the ideals of revolution
 iske baavjood is vidhi samhita kii mahatta samooche desh main kanoon kii ekarupata pradaan karne tathaa vyaavhaarik rup se nyaay vyavastha ko aasaan banane main thi
 This code was enforced wherever Napoleon's armies went and remained intact even after Napoleon's defeat
 yah nepolian kii ek sthaayee kirti he
 Napoleon's Code of Law emphasizes the interests of the bourgeoisie more
 bhoomi sambandhi adhikari ko or majboot banaaya gaya or vyakti sampati kii raksha ko or majboot banaaya gaya or vyaktigat sampati kii raksha ke liye kai kanoon banaae
 Creating a trade union was declared a crime
 mukademen kii sthiti main mazdooron kii daleelon ke badale maalikon kii baton ko nyaayalayon ko maanane ko kaha gaya
 Social equality is also the basis of the civil code
 visheshadhikaar or saamanti niyam kaa samhita main koi sthaan nahin tha
 There was not even a law to consider the elder son as the heir to the property, all the sons were given equal rights on the property
 nepolian ne samaaj main ek naveen kuleen varg kii sthapana kii
 He determined the order of titles according to income
 nepolian kaa yah kaary kranti ke aadarshon ke vipareet tha
 Napoleon's appearance on the European political horizon was like a wandering wheel and he soon became the destiny of Europe on the strength of his process and hard work
 usamen adbhut sainik tathaa prashasnic kshamta se sabhi kochakit kar diya
 But his pillar of strength was like standing on the sand wall
 jo kuch hi varshon main dhwast ho gaya vastut: nepolian kaa utthan or patan chakachaundh karne vaali ulka ke samaan hua
 He shone in the sky of Europe on the strength of military success, but with defeat, the star of his destiny sank
 jis samrajya kii kathin parishram ke pashchaat kaayam kiya gaya tha vah dekhte hi dekhte samaapt ho gaya uske patan ke anek kaaran the jo sa prakaar he
 Infinitely ambitious nepolian aseem mahatvakankshi tha
 The infinite great ambition proves to be the main cause of a person's downfall
 nepolian ke saath bhi yahi baat thi
 As the war progressed, his ambition increased and he began to dream of establishing a world state
 yadi thode se hi vah santusht ho jaataa or jite hue samrajya kii dekhbhaal karata or apana samay usamen lagaataa to use patan kaa durdasha nahin dekhnaa padataa
 Character weakness nepolian main saahas sanyam or dhairya kut- kut kar bharaa tha parantu uski drushti main ghrinaa uskaa pratishodh uskaa kartavya tathaa kshamaadaan kalank tha
 The great weakness of his character was that he did not consider the treaty to be a respected agreement
 kisi bhi desh kii maitri uske liye raajnneetik aavashyaktaa se adhik nahin thi
 Gradually he became stubborn
 He believed that every step of his was okay
 vah kabhi bhul nahin kar saktaa vah dusron kii salaah kii upeksha karne laga
 As a result, his true friends also went away from him
 nepolian kii vyavastha kaa sanyavad par aadhaarit hona- His political system was based on militarism which proved to be the primary cause of its downfall
 vah sabhi maamalon main sena par nirbhar rahata tha falat: vah hameshaa yuddh main hi ulajhaa rahaa
 He forgot that militarism can only be beneficial in times of crisis
 jab tak france vipattiyon ke badal chhaae rahe vahaan kii janata ne uskaa saath diya vipattiyon ke hatate hi janata ne uskaa saath dena chhod diya
 Losing the sympathy and love of the French public proved fatal to him
 uske atirikt parajeet raashtra uske shatru banate gaye jo avasar milte hi uske khilaaf uth khadey hue
 The historian Kabban has rightly written
 ‘nepolian kaa samrajya yuddh main panpa tha yuddh hi uske astitv kaa aadhaar tha or yuddh main hi uskaa ant hua
 ' doshapurn sainik vyavastha- Initially, the French army was steeped in the spirit of patriotism
 uske samaksh ek adarsh kaa or vah ek uddeshy kii purti ke liye yuddh karata tha
 But as his empire expanded, the national form of the army became legalized
 pehle uski sena main francisi sainik te parantu baad main usamen german italian purtegali or dach sainik shaamil kar liya gaya
 As a result, his army became the army of many states
 unke saamne koi adarsh or uddeshy nahin tha
 Hence, his military power continued to weaken and this proved to be an important reason for his downfall
 nausena kii durbalata- Napoleon had properly organized the army, but he lacked a powerful navy, which caused him to be defeated by England
 agar uske paas shaktishaalee nausena hoti to use england se parajeet nahin hona padataa
 Lack of patriotism in the conquered territories usne jin pradeshon par vijay praapt kii vahin kii janata ke hryday main uske prati sadbhaavna or prem nahin tha
 They hated Napoleon's rule
 jab uski shakti kamjor padane lagi to uske adhinsth rajya apni swatantraaa ke liye praytn karne lage
 The European nation formed a fourth bloc for the League against him and consequently was defeated in the Battle of Waterloo
 pope se shatruta- Due to the continental system, he made the Pope his enemy
 jab pope ne usee mahadwipiya vyavastha ko maanane se inkaar kar diya to usne april 1808 main rome par adhikaar kar liya
 And in 1809 AD, the Pope was imprisoned, leading Catholics to believe that Napoleon was the only demon destroying the freedoms of the states
 varanaa unka dharm nasht karne vaala bhi he
 industrial Revolution- kaha jaataa he ki uski paraaj waterlu ke maidan main na hokar manchester ke kaarkaanon or barkingdhan ke lohe ke bhadiyaan main hui
 As a result of the Industrial Revolution, large-2 factories were opened in England and England became prosperous upon seeing it
 falat: vah apni sena kii aadhunik hatyar se sampann kar sakaa jo nepolian ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Continental system mahadwipiya vyavastha uski jabardast bhul thi
 He considered England as his biggest enemy
 england kii shakti kaa mukhya aadhaar nausena or vishwavyaapee vyapaar ta uski nausakti ko nepolian samaapt nahin kar sakaa isliye uske vyapaar par aghat karne kii cheshtaa kii gai
 For this purpose, he gave birth to the continental system, he issued an order that no country can do trade with England
 or na to england kii bani hui vastu kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 This was Napoleon's terrible mistake
 is vyavastha ne use ek aise jaal main fasaa diya jisase nikalnaa mushkil ho gaya
 Therefore, the continental system is considered to be the main reason for its collapse
 purtegal ke saath yuddh – Purtigal had a commercial relationship with England, but Napoleon's pressure forced him to break ties with England
 isse purtegal ko kaaphi nuksaan hua
 Therefore, he again established a commercial relationship with England
 isapar nepolian ne krodhit hokar purtegal par akraman kar diya
 This too proved fatal for Napoleon
 spain ke saath sangharsh- Napoleon's third mistake was his interference in Spain's internal affairs
 iske lakhon sainik maare gaye
 As a result, his position in this war became absolutely weak
 jisase uske virodhiyon ko protsaahan mila jab nepolian ne apane bhai ko spain kaa raja banaaya to vahaan ke nivasee us videshi ko raja maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 He drove Napoleon's army from Spain
 us vidroh se anya deshon ko bhi protsaahan mila or ve bhi vidroh karne lage jisase uskaa patan avashyambhavi ho gaya
 Russia's campaign nepolian ne rus par akraman kar baari bhul kii rus ne isaki mahadwipiya vyavastha ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Napoleon attacked Russia at this
 isamen yaddhapi masco par iskaa aadhikaar ho gaya lekin use mahaan kshati uthaani padi
 His opponents planned to attack
 ise akraman main use parajeet hona padaa
 Fatigue anek yuddh main lagaataar vyast rahane ke kaaran vah thak chukaa tha 50 sailaaniyon ne likhaa he nepolian ke patan kaa samast kaaran ek hi shabd thakaan main nihit he
 As he got entangled in the war, as his power weakened, he became tired and due to this his downfall became necessary
 sagesambandhi- His immediate relatives were no less responsible for his downfall
 halanki vah apane sambandhiyon ke prati udaartaa kaa bartaav karata tha
 But whenever he was in trouble, his relatives did not help him
 chaturthgut ke sanghathan- Taking advantage of the weakness of Napoleon, his enemies formed the fourth faction and the Allies defeated him
 use pakad kar salbai bheja gaya or use vahaan kaa swatantra shaasha banaaya gaya lekin nepolian vahaan bahut dinon tak nahin rah sakaa vah sheeghra hi france laut gaya or vahaan kaa shaasha ban baitha
 But this time he remained the emperor for only a hundred days
 mitra rashtron ne 18 june 1815 i
 ko waterlu ke yuddh main antim rup se parajeet kar diya
 The captured Allies sent him as a prisoner to an island called St
 Helena where he died in 1821, at the age of 52 years
 is prakaar uparyukt sabhi kaaran pratyaksh evam apratyaksh rup se uske patan ke liye uttaradaayi the usne yuddh ke dwaara hi apane samrajya kaa nirmaan kiya tha or yudhon ke chalate hi uskaa patan bhi hua
 That is, those elements who built Napoleon's empire also destroyed them
