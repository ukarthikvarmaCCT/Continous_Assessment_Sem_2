 shyaam sundar das jivan ke antim kshan tak sahitya-seva main sakriy rahe
 Just before and after independence, the entire generation of Hindi grew only by sitting on Babuji's shoulders
 samay-samay par vibhinn vishyon par sammelnon main diye jane vaale unke vaktavyon kii sankhya anginat he
 Looking at all this thinking, it becomes clear how they wanted to pursue Hindi literature by connecting it with many subjects
 aaj bhi babuji kii bahut badi dein he paathya-saamagree kii pramanik rachana tathaa adhyayan ke kshetra kaa vivek
 His every minute effort to bring fresh material to the students resulted in his becoming a collector
 aalochana kii jaati he ki isi kaaran unke lekhan main gahraayi or moulikta kaa abhaav hota gaya
 But it remains to be seen that his syncretic intelligence was engrossed in the material collection of many knowledge fields
 yahan tak ki vyaavhaarik-aalochana main bhi babuji ne saamanjasywad kaa saundarya sthapit kiya
 That is why comparison, historical view, interpretation, commentary etc
 entered his criticism
 is tarah hindi main vyaavhaarik-aalochana kaa aarmabhik maarg bhi unhone taiyaar kiya
 His efficient leadership later proved to be a boon for the Hindi-speaking region
 babu shyaam sundar das ne vichaaratmak tathaa bhavatmak donon hi ek prakaar ke niabandh likhe hai
 There is enough variety in the subject of his essays
 unhone bahut se achoote vishyon par bhi lekhnee chalaai kaviyon kii khoj tathaa itihaas sambandhi nibandhon main unki pratibha ke darshan hote hai
 The language of Babu Shyam Sundar Das is pure literary Hindi, in which the corresponding words of Sanskrit are predominant
 bhashaa ke sambandh main unka vichaar tha- 'jab ham videshi bhaavon ke saath videshi shabdon ko grahan karen tab unhen aisa bana len ki unamem se videshipan nikal jaae or ve apane hokar hamaare vyakaran ke niyamon se anushaasit hon
 'therefore, wherever they have used the prevalent words of' Urdu 'in their language, they have removed their form, removing the dots under the words pen, drill, law etc
 and changing their pronunciation
 isi prakaar sanskrit ke shabdon kii clishtataa dur kar ke unhen hindi main saral dhang se likhaa he- jaise- kaary ke sthaan par kaary, anjan ke sthaan par anjan
 Babu Shyamsunder Das was of the opinion about the word selection- 'first place is the words of pure Hindi, the simple and popular words of Sanskrit behind it, the simple and popular words of foreign languages like Persian and behind it, the obsolete of Sanskrit
 Let the words be spaced
 farsi aadi videshi bhashaaon ke kathin shabdon kaa prayog kadaapi na ho
 Babu Shyam Sundar Das has written mainly in two types of styles - 1
 vichaaratmak style- vichaaratmak style main vichaaratmak niabandh likhe gaye hai
 The sentences in this style are short and expressive
 bhashaa sabal, saral or pravahamayi he
 For example- 'gopiyo kaa sneh badhaya he
 They are compiled with Krishna in Ras Leela
 anek utsav manaati he
 This behavior of Premmayi gopikas is very delightful
 usamen kahin se aswabhaaviktaa nahin aa saki
 2
 Exploratory Style - The explanatory style is used in exploratory essays
 inamen vaakya apekshaakrit kuch lambey hai
 There is a plethora of corresponding words in the language
 vishay kii gahanta tathaa shushkta ke kaaran yah style main kuch shushk or rahit he
 See an example of this type of style- 'yah jivan-sangram do bhinn sabhyataaon ke sangharshan se or bhi teevr or dukhamay prathit hone laga he
 According to this condition, when literature is generated and will stimulate the brain of the society and will react only then the signs of real progress will be seen and its welfare will give the country the glory of modern times
 babu shyaam sundardaas kii kisi prakaar kii style main alankaaron kii sajaavat nahin pai jaati
 Sayings and idioms have been used sparingly
 apane vichaaron ko bhalee prakaar samajhane ke liye babu shyaam sundar das ne ek hi baat ko 'saransh yah he' 'athwa', 'jaise' aadi shabdon ke saath baar-baar duharaaya he
 In Hindi literature, Babu Shyam Sundar Das has been replaced as his Hindi Promoter and Hindi Unnayak
 unhone anek moulik granthon kii rachana kii
 Edited many texts
 kaashi nagari-prachaarini sabha kii sthapana main unka pramukh haath tha

 1907 main unhone hindi arya bhashaa pustkaalay kii sthapana kii, pracheen mahatvapurn granthon kaa sampaadan kiya or shiksha str ke anuroop paathya pustakon kaa nirmaan kaary bhi aarambh kiya
 Ramchandra Shukla has written in the history of Hindi literature: shyaam sundar das na keval santhaan-nirmaataa the, balki prabandh-kala main bhi bejod the
 He worked determinedly to overcome the shortages of all areas of literature
 bhashaa tatvavetta ke rup main yaa siddhanton ke vyaakhyaata rup main unheen kii uplabdhiyon ke kaaran saahityalochan hindi ke vidhyaarthiyon kaa bahut samay tak kanthhaar bana rahaa
 In his mind, the notion remained that the basis of the theoretical review of Hindi should be made by combining Sanskrit and Western criticism-principles and with a special harmony
 shyaam sundar das se pehle hindi or nagari lipi ke liye vishesh rup se sankatpurna samay tha
 Pratap Narayan Mishra had established meetings for the promotion of Hindi in many places
 aisi hi ek sabha 1884 main ‘hindi uddharini pratinidhi madhya bharat sabha’ ke naam se prayag main pratishthit kii gayi
 Bharatendu Harishchandra also ventured several times for Nagari's entry into government offices, but he could not succeed
 iske baavjood praytn baraabar chalata rahaa
 Due to the court language being Urdu, the number of newly educated Urdu readers was more, due to which the work of publishing Hindi books could not proceed
 is sahitya-sankat ke atirikt nagari kaa pravesh sarkari dacrataron main na hone se nagari jaanane vaali janata ke saamne ghor sankat tha
 In the same period, Kashi Nagari Pracharini Sabha was established in 1893 from the industry of some enthusiastic students, among whom Babu Shyam Sundar Das was the chief
 yahan bhi ramchandra shukla kaa kathan yaad rakhana chahie ki, ‘sach puuchhie to is sabha kii sari samruddhi or kirti babu shyaam sundar das ke tyaag or satat parishram kaa fal he
 They continued to do it from the beginning till the end and kept it ready in many big industries

 The Nagari Prachar movement created new enthusiasm among Hindi-lovers and many people became devoted to the growth of literature

 Namdev is considered dead haalanki, use don dwaara bachaaya gaya he or koi bhi nahin jaanata ki vah jivit he
 Twenty years later, Damu and Raghu use the money from their stolen lottery to build luxurious hotels and make millions
 wo ab bahut safal vyavsaayee ban gaye hai
 Damu has used a part of his money to send his youngest son Vicky to school in England
 unhone namdev ke sabase bade bete johny or vicky ke sabase achche dost johny ko hotel main waiter ke rup main kaam par rakh liya

 The reason for this is that matter deteriorates due to the movement of Prabhrash
 ham agar kisi bhi tarah is prabhrang gati ko kathin karen to ham saamagree ko majboot bana sakate hai
 This can be done in many ways such as reducing the size of the grain, solid solution reinforcement, precipitate reinforcement, cold working
 dislokeshan moshan ko kathin banane se saamagree kii majbootee badhati he, is baat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ham upar likhe takneeko ko samajhane kii koshish karenge
 Because the grain boundary is a barrier to dislocation motion, we can increase the number of constraints by reducing the grain size
 do hisson / daano ke bich main jitani zaadi missorientation hoti he, seemaa baadha kii takat dislokeshan moshan ko rokane kii or bhi bad jaati he
 The impurities in the crystal that distort the lattice create tension which increases the difficulty for the dislocation motion
 mishra dhaatu main jahaan chote apavitra parmaanu, dislokeshan kii jagah ikattha ho jate he jisase dislokeshan kii badhane kii yogyata kam ho jaati he
 It is very difficult for a dislocation to shear and move at any velocity
 aisa karne ke liye adhik share stress kii zaroorat padhegi
 For example: Aluminum is reinforced in the inner wing of the aeroplane in a similar way
 taapmaana jis par deformation hota he vah saamagree kii purna galnaank se kam he, isiilie ham ise cold work kehete he
 Strain hardening is the way in which ductile material becomes strong, the reason being that it becomes a permanent vicar

 The more cold work you do, the more stress it will take to perform

 regular oxpraishan, jise praayah pattern bhi kaha jaataa he, ek aisa suchak he jo strings ke ek set ke bare main vistaar se batalaata he
 They are usually used to summarize sets without creating a list of elements

 | gray and gry are identical patterns that describe both "gray" and "gray" sets
 udhaaharan ke liye, ab*c "ac ", "abc ", "abbc ", "abbbc " or isi prakaar se mail khaataa he
 These textures can be arbitrarily joined together to form complex indexes, just as one can construct arithmetic indicators from numbers and operations +, -, × and ÷

 Part of the design philosophy of Perl 6 is to improve the integration of Perl's regular expressions and to increase their scope and capabilities to allow the grammar of the terminology of the indicators to be defined
 As a result, a minor language Perl 6 rule was created, which is used to define Perl 6 grammar as well as to provide tools for programmers in the language

 Pattern Matching: See also History regular oxpraishan ko aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 Regular expressions have constants and operators, which respectively indicate the sets of strings that act upon these sets

 ek seemaabaddh varnmaala σ ko dekhte hue nimnlikhit sthiraankon kii paribhaasha di gai he: The following operations are defined: | α in r and β in s } ko sanketit karata he
 For example {"ab", "c"} {"d", "ef"} = {"abd", "abef", "cd", "cef"}
 | s jo r or s ke gathbandhan ko sanketit karata he
 For example {"ab", "c"} | {"ab", "d", "ef"} = {"ab", "c", "d", "ef"}

 agar koi sanshay nahin he to koshthkon kaa lop ho saktaa he
 For example, c can be written as abc and a |) as a | bc *
 kai paathya pustakon main lamberup baar ke badale sangyojan ke liye ∪, +, yaa ∨ chihnon kaa prayog miltaa he
 Examples: |b* {ε, {0}a, b, bb, bbb, 


} ko sanketit karata he
 | b) * Empty string: {ε, {0} denotes a set of all strings with no symbols other than a and b, including a, b, aa, ab, ba, bb, aaa, 


}
 |ε) a se aarambh kar strings ke set ko, tab jiro athwa adhik b s or ant main vikalp ke saath a c : {{0}a, ac, ab, abc, abb, abbc, 


} ko sanketit karata he
 Is the formal definition of regular expression intentionally economical and unnecessary quantifier? To avoid and +, which can be expressed as: a + = aa * and a? =
 kabhi-kabhi poorak oparator ko joda jaataa he; Rc Σ* par sabhi strings ke set ko jo r c main nahin hai, sanketit karte hai
 As a rule, the complement operator is unnecessary, as can be limited by using other operators
 haalanki, aise nirupan computing prakriya jatil he or iske parinaam ko aise aakaar ke suchakon kii aavashyaktaa pad sakati he jo ghaataanki rup se dogune bade hai
 In this sense, regular expressions can denote well-organized language, precisely the category of language accepted by regular finite automata
 haalanki phir bhi susanhati main ek ullekhneey antar he
 Some categories of well-organized languages can be described by regular finite automata, whose size exponentially increases to the smallest regular expression
 bhashaaen hi yahaan maanak udhaaharan hai
 The Lk character {{0} a, b} whose last letter is equal to ka with all its strings
 ek ore, l 4 ko varnit karne vaale regular oxpraishan ∗ a { \ displaystyle ^{*}a} diya hua he
 This pattern gives the normalization indicator in Lk duusari ore, yah vidit he ki Lk bhashaa ko sweekaar karata hua niatatmak parimit autometon ke paas kai sthitiyon main kam se kam 2k ke hona jaruri he
 Fortunately, more common than regular expressions is simple mapping from non-finite to finite automata, which does not suddenly assume such a large explosive size; This is why nfas are often used as alternative representations of well-organized languages

 Finally, it is worth noting that many regular expression engines in the world apply features that cannot be described in terms of formal language theory by regular expression; See below for more information on this subject
 jaisaa ki udaahranon ko dekhne se pataa chalata he, vibhinn regular oxpraishan usee bhashaa ko abhivyakt kar sakate hai: ritivaad anaavashyak he
 It is possible to write in the algorithm between the given regular expressions to decide whether the mentioned languages are essentially the same
 This reduces each expression to the extent of the minimum deterministic finite state machine and determines whether they are homogeneous equivalents
 is anaavashyaktaa ko kis had tak nikaal diya ja saktaa he? kya ham regular oxpraishan kaa ek rochak subset khoj sakate hai jo puri tarah suchak ho? clin tara or set kaa gathbandhan spashtatah aavashyak he, lekin shaayad ham unke prayog par roak laga sakate hai
 This can turn into a surprisingly difficult problem

 The IEEE POSIX Basic Regular Expression Standard was designed specifically for inverse compatibility with traditional syntax, but it provided a common standard that has been adopted as the default syntax of many Unix regular expression devices, although It still often has some variations or additional features
 aise anek upkaran hai jo cmand line vishyon ke saath ERE vaakya-vinyas ko sahaara dete hai
 In the BRE syntax, most of the letters are taken in a literal sense - they match each other
 The exceptions listed below are called beyond characters or separated by sequences
 udhaaharan: Beyond letters means the opposite of syntax of POSIX extended regular expressions for some letters, avoiding the backslash
 is vaakya-vinyas main hi, ek bekaslash ke kaaran meta kairactor ko shabdic aksharon ke rup main mana jaataa he
 So for example, \ is now and \ { \ } is now {}
 Also, \ n has been omitted for previous references and is included beyond the following letters: udhaaharan: | dog corresponds with "cat" or "dog"
 POSIX vistaarit regular oxpraishan kaa prayog aksar aadhunik Unix prayojyata ke saath cmand line flag -E ko shaamil kar kiya ja saktaa he
 Since many categorized categories of characters are selected local settings, some of the POSIX standard letter categories or categories are shown in the following table: POSIX aksharon kii shreniyon kaa prayog keval koshthak suchakon ke andar hi ho saktaa he
 For example, ab] corresponds only to upper case capital letters and lowercase letters "a" and "b"
 Perl ke regular oxpraishan main, ke saath mail khaataa he or ke saath gathbandhan karata he
 An additional non-posix range understood by some devices is that typically defined by a plus underline underscore
 yah is tathy ko udbhasith karata he ki kai programing bhashaaon main ye hi ve akshar hai jinka prayog pahchaan chihn ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 Editor Vim further identifies the distinction between the Word and Word-head categories
 Since characters in many programming languages that can begin as an identification mark are not the same as those that may be present in other positions
 yah drashtavy he ki POSIX regular oxpraishan maanakon kol kairactor claces duusare regular oxpraishan ke rang main, jo unhen sahyog pradaan karte hue unhen saadharantaya POSIX kairactor claces ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 Character classes with most other regular expression flavors are used to describe POSIX defined parenthesis indicators
 POSIX basic or vistaarit regular oxpraishan maanakon kii tulana main Perl ke paas adhik susangat or samrudh vaakya-vinyas he
 An example of its continuity is that \ always runs separately from non-alphanumeric characters

 Because of its widely suggestive capabilities, many other usability and programming languages have adopted syntax like Perl - for example, Java, javascript, PCRE, Python, Ruby, Microsoft's 
NET Framework, and w3c's XML
 Schema uses all regular expression syntax like Perl
 kuch bhashaaen evam upkaran jaise ki Boost or PHP bahu regular oxpraishan flavor ko sahyog pradaan karte hai
 Perl derivatives do not have uniformity in implementation of regular expressions and some implement only a subset of Perl's attributes

 Simple regular expression is a syntax that can be used in historical versions of computer application programs and can also be supported by some applications within itself
 pichhali anurupata pradaan karne ke uddeshy se ise anuchit samajha gaya he
 In standard expressions standard modifiers are greedy, meaning they match as many times as they can, leaving the rest to be a new match with the regex
 udhaaharan ke liye,regexes ke liye koi nayaa jo kisi ek item ke bich pratham drushtaant khojna chahta he, is udhaaharan main pratik chihnon ke bich paa saktaa he

 jo, pattern ke saath athwa isi ke samaan aana chahega
 haalanki yah pattern vastav main ", " ke badale "" main waapas janaa chahega, jo apekshit tha, kyonki * parimann jo laalchee he -- atah yah yathasambhav adhik se adhik aksharon kaa upbhog input se kar lenaa chahega, evam "january 26>, " ke paas "january 26" kii tulana main adhik akshar honge
 While this problem can be avoided in many ways, modern regular expression tools allow a quantizer to be characterized as sluggish, followed by a question mark after the quantizer, or by using modifiers that reverse the measureer's greed
 gives 
 Indicators first try to match the least, using the sluggish measure
 haalanki purvavarti udhaaharan main sust mail kaa prayog kai melon ke parinaamon main se kisi ek kaa chunaav karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, kuch maamalon main iskaa prayog behatar nishpaadan ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he, jab laalchee milan ko adhik peeche hatane kii jarurat padegi
 Patterns for Chaotic Languages many features derived from modern regular expression collections provide suggestive capabilities that exceed those of well-organized languages
 udhaaharan ke liye, kai karyanvayan up suchakon ke samoohikaran kii anumati pradaan karte hai or usee suchak main mail karaane kii keemat yaad dilaate hai
 This means that a pattern may correspond to repeated words, such as "papa" or "wikiwiki", which in formal language theory is called squares
 in ladiyon ke liye pattern he \ 1
 However, the language of squares is not well-organized
 na hi yah vishay se mukt he
 An unlimited number of back references coincide with the pattern, as is supported by an unlimited number of modern tools, np-complete
 haalanki, kai upkaran, libraries or ingine jo aisi sanrachanaayen uplabdh karaate hai, ab bhi regular oxpraishan shabdaawalee kaa prayog apane patternas ke liye karte hai
 It has named the regular expression vocabulary, which has many different meanings for formal language theory and pattern
 is kaaran, kuch log regex yaa keval pattern shabdaawalee kaa prayog parvarti kii vyakhya main karte hai
 Larry Wall, author of the Perl programming language, writes about the design of Perl 6 in an essay: kam se kam teen alag-alag kalam vidhiyaan kalanvidhi hai, jo nirdhaarit karti hai ki ek diya gaya regular oxpraishan kis prakaar ek string ke saath mail khata he
 Two formal language theories dependent on the oldest and fastest results that accepts the conversion of each non-deterministic finite position machine into a deterministic finite position machine
 DFA kaa spasht rup se nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he or tab iske parinamswaroop input par ek baar main ek pratik chinh par parichaalit hota he
 Creating a DFA for the size of a regular expression at the cost of "O" takes time and memory, but it can only run in o time on a string of n sizes
 ek vaikalpik prayaas NFA ko sidhe anukaran karnaa he, maang karne par anivaary rup se prayek DFA sthiti kaa nirmaan or tab agle kadam par sambhawatah caching ke saath ise baahar nikaal dena
 yah DFA ko antarnihit rakhata he or nirmaan kii ghaataank laagat se bachaa ja saktaa he, lekin chalan laagat o tak bad jaati he
 This explicit step is called the DFA algorithm and the underlying step is called the NFA algorithm
 As both can be seen in different ways in implementing the same DFA, they are also often called algorithms without discrimination
 ye kalan vidhiyaan tej hai lekin samoohikrut upasuchakon ko lautaane ke liye unka prayog sust parimann evam isi prakaar kii visheshtaayen pechida hai
 The third algorithm is to match the input string with the pattern via the back track
 is kalanvidhi ko aamtaur par NFA kaha jaataa he, lekin yah shabdaawalee aspasht he
 Its running time can be exponential, which its simple implementation reveals when matching against indicators such as * b which has both alternation and infinite quantification
 kalanvidhi par jor daalate hai ki sthanapann maamalon kii babbti hui ghaataanki sankhya par vichaar karen
 adhik jatil karyanvayan aksar chihnit or gatisheel karte hai yaa saadhaaran maamalon ko radd kar detii hai, jab unka chalan mand ho jaataa he
 Although back tracking implementations guarantee an exponential in the worst case scenario, they provide much greater flexibility and pointer power
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi bhi karyanvayan jo bakarefrences ke prayog kii anumati detaa he yaa parl dwaara lagu kiye gaye vibhinn ekstensionas ko karyanvit karata he, use back trekking karyanvayan kaa avashya prayog karnaa chahie
 Some implementations provide two of the best algorithms by first running fast DFA to find out if the regular expressions are even slightly matching with the string, and only in this case possibly a dim back tracking match
 regular oxpraishan kaa aarambhik prayog ASCII aksharon ke saath hua
 Many regular expression engines can now work with full Unicode as well

 bharat chhodte samay jain bhikshu becharji ke samaksh hinduon ko maance, sharaab tathaa sankeern vichaardhaara ko tyaagane ke liye apni apni mata ji ko die gayi ek vachan ne unke shahi rajdhani landan main bitaaye gayi samay ko kaaphi prabhavit kiya
 However, Gandhiji also experienced English customs such as going to dance classes for example
 phir bhi vah apni makaan malkin dwaara maance evam patta gobhi ko hajam
nahin kar sake
 He pointed to some vegetarian eateries
 apni mata kii ichchhaaon ke bare main jo kuch unhone padhaa tha use sidhe apnaane kii bajaay unhone bauddhikta se shaakaahaari bhojan kaa apana bhojan sweekaar kiya
 He joined the membership of the vegetarian society and was also selected for its executive committee where he laid the foundation of a local chapter
 baad main unhone sansthaayen gathit karne main mahatvapurn anubhav kaa parichay dete hue ise shrey diya
 Some of the vegetarian people he met were also members of the Theosophical Society
 is socity kii sthapana 1875 main vishwa bandhutv ko prabal karne ke liye kii gayi thi or ise buddha dharm evam sanathan dharm ke sahitya ke adhyayan ke liye samarpit kiya gaya tha
 They inspired Gandhi to read Shrimad Bhagwad Gita
 hindu, isai, buddha, islam or anya dharmon 
ke bare main padhane se pehle gandhi ne dharm main vishesh ruchi nahin dikhaayi
 He returned to India after being called back to the England and Wales Bar Association but did not have much success in advocating in Bombay
 baad main ek hai skool shikshak ke rup main anshkalik naukari kaa prarthana patr asweekaar kar diye jane par unhone jaruratmandon ke liye mukademe kii arjiyaan likhane ke liye rajkot ko hi apana sthaayee mukaam bana liya
 But due to the stupidity of an English officer, he had to leave this business too
 apni aatmakatha main unhone is ghatana kaa varnan apane bade bhai kii ore se paroapkaar kii asafal koshish ke rup main kiya he
 It was for this reason that he accepted the practice of advocating a one-year contract with an Indian firm in 1893 in Natal South Africa, which was then part of the British Empire
 dakshin africa main gandhi ko bharatiyon par bhedbhaav kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 He was initially thrown out of the train for refusing to enter the third class compartment after having a valid first class coach ticket
 itnaa hi nahin paaydaan par shesh yatra karte hue ek european yatri ke andar aane par chaalak kii maar bhi jhelni padi
 He faced many other difficulties in his journey
 africa main kai hotalon ko unke liye varjit kar diya gaya
 Similarly, there was one of many incidents in which a court judge ordered him to take off his turban which he did not believe
 ye sari ghatnaayen gandhi ke jivan main ek mode ban gayi or vidyaman saamaajik anyaay ke prati jaagarukta kaa kaaran baniin tathaa saamaajik sakriyata kii vyakhya karne main madadgaar siddh huin
 In view of the injustice being done to Indians in South Africa, Gandhi raised questions for the honor of his countrymen under the English Empire and for his own position in the country
 1906 main, zulu dakshin africa main nae chunaav kar ke lagu karne ke baad do angrej adhikariyon ko maar daalaa gaya
 In return, the British launched a war against Julu
 gandhi ji ne bharatiyon ko bhartee karne ke liye british adhikariyon ko sakriy rup se prerit kiya
 His argument was that Indians should cooperate in war efforts to legalize their citizenship claims
 tathaapi, angrejon ne apni sena main bharatiyon ko pad dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Despite this, he accepted Gandhiji's proposal that Indians can do voluntary work to bring wounded British soldiers to Stetcher for treatment
 is kor kii bagdor gandhi ne thami
 On 21 July 1906, Gandhiji wrote in the Indian Opinion of the Indian Opinion that a corps has been formed at the behest of the Natal Government by experiment in relation to the operation against 23 Indian residents
 dakshin africa main bhartiya logon se indian opinian main apane cholemon ke madhyam se is yuddh main shaamil hone ke liye aagrah kiya or kaha, yadi sarkaar keval yahi mahasoos karti he ki arakshit bal bekaar ho rahe hai tab ve iskaa upyog karenge or asli ladaai ke liye bharatiyon kaa prashikshan dekar iskaa avasar denge
 In Gandhi's opinion, the draft ordinance of 1906 was like bringing the status of Indians below the level of a resident
 isliye unhone satyagrah, kii tarj par "kafir s " 
kaa udhaaharan dete hue bharatiyon se adhyadesh kaa virodh karne kaa aagrah kiya
 In his words, "even half the castes and Kafirs who are less modern than us have opposed the government
 paas kaa niyam un par bhi lagu hota he kintu ve paas nahin dikhaate hai
 Gandhi returned from South Africa in 1915 to live in India
 unhone bhartiya rashtriya congress ke adhiveshnon par apane vichaar vyakt kiye, lekin unke vichaar bharat ke mukhya muddon, raajnneeti tathaa us samay ke congress dal ke pramukh bhartiya netaa gopal krishna gokhale par hi aadhaarit the jo ek sammanit netaa the
 Gandhi's first major achievement came in 1918 in the Champaran Satyagraha and the Kheda Satyagraha, although the movements of indigo cash-paying food crops were also important, rather than the food crops necessary for his subsistence
 jameendaaron kii takat se daman hue bharatiyon ko nammaatr bharpai bhatta diya gaya jisase ve atyadhik garibi se ghir gaye
 Villages badly dirty and unhealthy; And was bound by liquor, untouchability, and veils
 ab ek vinaashkari akaal ke kaaran shahi kosh kii bharpai ke liye angrejon ne damankaaree kar laga die jinka boj din pratidin badhata hi gaya
 This situation was disappointing
 kheda, gujarat main bhi yahi samasya thi
 Gandhiji built an ashram there where many of his supporters and new voluntary workers were organized
 unhone gaanvon kaa ek vistrut adhyayan or surveykshan kiya jisamen praaniyon par hue atyaachaar ke bhayanak candon kaa lekhajokha rakhaa gaya or isamen logon kii anutpaadakeey saamaanya avasthaa ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Creating confidence in the villagers, he started his work by cleaning the villages under which schools and hospitals were built and the rural leadership was motivated to eliminate many of the social evils mentioned above
 lekin iske pramukh prabhaav us samay dekhne ko mili jab unhen ashaanti failaane ke liye police ne giraftaar kiya or unhen praant chhodane ke liye aadesh diya gaya
 Thousands of people protested and took out rallies outside jails, police stations and courts and demanded Gandhi ji to be released unconditionally
 gandhi ji ne jameendaaron ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan or hadataalon ko kaa netritv kiya jinhone angreji sarkaar ke maargdarshan main us kshetra ke garib kisaanon ko adhik kshatipurti manjuur karne tathaa kheti par niyantran, rajasav main badhotari ko radd karnaa tathaa ise sangrahit karne vaale ek samjhaute par hastakshar kiye
 It was during this struggle that Gandhiji was addressed by the public in the name of Bapu's father and Mahatma
 kheda main sardaar patel ne angrejon ke saath vichaar vimarsh ke liye kisaanon kaa netritv kiya jisamen angrejon ne rajasav sangrahan se mukti dekar sabhi kaidiyon ko reeha kar diya gaya tha
 As a result, Gandhi's fame spread across the country
 gandhi ji ne asahyog, ahimsa tathaa shantipurna pratikaar ko angrejon ke khilaaf shastr ke rup main upyog kiya
 The Jallianwala massacre of Indians by the British forces in Punjab, also known as the Amritsar massacre, caused tremendous shock to the nation, which sparked a flame of anger and violence in the public
 gandhiji ne british raaj tathaa bharatiyon dwaara pratikaratmak ravaiya donon kii kii
 He expressed condolences to the British citizens and victims of the riots and condemned the riots after the initial opposition of the party
 gandhi ji ke bhaavnaatmak bhaashan ke baad apane siddhant kii vakaalat kii ki sabhi hinsa or buraai ko nyyochit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he
 But it was with this massacre and subsequent violence that Gandhiji focused his mind on bringing complete control over the entire government and the Indian government-occupied institutions, which would soon turn into Swaraj or complete personal, spiritual and political freedom
 disambar 1921 main gandhi jo bhartiya rashtriya congress
kaa kaaryakari adhikari niyukt kiya gaya
 Under his leadership, the Congress was organized with a new objective called Swaraj
 pardi main sadsyta sankethik shulk kaa bhugtane par sabhi ke liye khuli thi
 To improve the discipline within it, a Padasopan Samiti was formed to make the party not a single elite organization but to make it a party of the national people
 gandhi ji ne apane ahimsaatmak manch ko swadeshi niti — main shaamil karne ke liye vistaar kiya jisamen videshi vastuon visheshkar angreji vastuon kaa bahishkaar karnaa tha
 His advocacy associated with this was that all Indians should wear handmade khadi by our own people rather than the clothes made by the British
 gandhi ji ne swatantraaa andolan ko sahyog dene ke liepurushon or mahilaon ko pratidin khaadi ke liye soot kaatne main samay bitaane ke liye kaha
 It was a policy of bringing discipline and dedication to overcome reluctance and ambition and to replace them with women at a time when there were many ideas that such activities are not respectable for women
 iske alaava gandhi ji ne britain kii shaikshik sansthaaon tathaa adaalaton kaa bahishkaar or sarkari naukariyon ko chhodane kaa tathaa sarkaar se praapt tamagon or sammaan ko waapas lautaane kaa bhi anurodh kiya
 Non-cooperation got far-reaching appeal and success which increased the enthusiasm and participation of people from all sections of the society
 phir jaise hi yah andolan apane sheersh par pahunchaa vaise farvari 1922 main iskaa ant chauri-chora, uttarapradesh main bhayanak dwesh ke rup main ant hua
 In view of the fear of the movement adopting a stand of violence and considering that it would destroy all its actions, Gandhiji withdrew this movement of widespread non-cooperation
 gandhi par giraftaar kiya gaya 10 march, 1922, ko rajdroh ke liye gandhi ji par mukadmaa chalaaya gaya jisamen unhen chah saal kaid kii sajaa sunaakar gel bhed diya gaya
 From March 18, 1922, he spent only 2 years in prison that he was released in February 1924 for an intestinal operation
 gandhi ji ke ekta vaale vyaktitv ke bina indian neshnal congress uske jail main do saal rahane ke dauraan hi do dalon main bantane lagi jiske ek dal kaa netritv sadan main party kii bhagidaari ke paksh vaale chitt ranjan das tathaa motilal nehru ne kiya to duusare dal kaa netritv iske vipareet chalane vaale chakravarti rajagopalacharya or sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne kiya
 In addition, cooperation between Hindus and Muslims was breaking at the peak of the non-violence movement
 gandhi ji ne is khai ko bahut se sadhano se bharne kaa prayaas kiya jisamen unhone 1924 kii basant main simit safalataa dilaane vaale teen saptaah kaa upwas karnaa bhi shaamil tha
 Gandhi stayed away from active politics and for most of the 1920s, he continued to fill the gap between the Swaraj Party and the Indian National Congress and in addition he waged a movement against untouchability, alcoholism, ignorance and poverty
 unhone pehle 1928 main laute 
ek saal pehle angreji sarkaar ne sar jon simon ke netritv main ek nayaa samvedhanik sudhaar ayog banaaya jisamen ek bhi sadsy bhartiya nahin tha
 This resulted in a boycott by Indian political parties
 disambar 1928 main gandhi ji ne kalakatta main yojit congress ke ek adhiveshan main ek prastaav rakhaa jisamen bhartiya samrajya ko satta pradaan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha athwa aisa na karne ke badale apane uddeshy ke rup main sampurna desh kii aazaadee ke liye asahyog andolan kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar rahen
 Gandhiji not only fueled the ideas of the youth group like Subhash Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru demanding immediate independence but also stopped his own demand for one year instead of two years
 angrejon ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 
no 31 December 1929, the flag of India was hoisted in Lahore
 26 janvari 1930 kaa din lahore main bhartiya swatantraaa diwas ke rup main indian neshnal congress ne manaaya
 The day was also celebrated by almost every Indian organization

 Thousands of Indians participated in this journey towards the sea

 The government, represented by Lord Edward Irwin, decided to hold discussions with Gandhiji

 To end the Civil Disobedience Movement, the British government agreed to release all political prisoners
 is samjhaute ke parinamswaroop gandhi ko bhartiya rashtriya congress ke ekmaatr pratinidhi ke rup main landan main yojit hone vaale golmes sammelan main bhaag lene ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya
 This conference was a great disappointment for Gandhi and the nationalists, because it was focused on Indian prices and Indian minorities rather than transferring power
 iske alaava, lard irvin ke uttaradhikari lard willington, ne rashtravaadiyon ke andolan ko niyantrit evam kuchalane kaa ek nayaa abhiyaan aarambh karadia
 Gandhi was arrested again and the government tried to prevent his followers from being influenced by Gandhi, keeping him completely away from them
 lekin, yah yukti safal nahin thi
 In 1932, through the campaigning of Dr
 Babasaheb Ambedkar, a Dalit leader and scholar scholar, the government approved separate elections to the untouchables under a new constitution
 iske virodh main dalit haton ke virdohi gandhi ji ne sitambar 1932 main chha: din kaa anshan le liya jisane sarkaar ko safaltaapurvak dalit se rajnatik netaa bane palavankar baaluu dwaara kii gai madhyasta vaali ek samaan vyavastha ko apnaane par bal diya
 Untouchables by Gandhi to improve the lives of the campaign was conducted
 gandhi ji ne in achhuton ko harijan kaa naam diya jinhen ve bhagwaan kii santan maanate the
 On 8 May 1933, Gandhiji undertook a 21-day fast of self-purification to help the Harijan movement
 yah nayaa abhiyaan daliton ko pasand nahin aayaa tathaapi ve ek pramukh netaa bane rahe
 Dr
 Ambedkar categorically condemned Gandhiji's use of the word Harijan, that Dalits are socially immature and that Indians belonging to the privileged caste have played a patriarchal role
 ambedkar or uske sahyogi dalon ko bhi mahasoos hua ki gandhi ji daliton ke raajnneetik adhikaron ko kam aank rahe hai
 Even though Gandhiji was born into a Vaishya caste, he insisted that he could raise his voice for Dalits despite a Dalit Masiha like Dr
 Ambedkar
 bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke dinon main hindustan kii saamaajik buraaiyon main main chuaachhut ek pramukh buraai thi jiske ke viruddh mahatma gandhi or unke anuyaayi sangharshrat rahete the
 At that time the entry of Harijans into the major temples of the country was completely restricted
 kerala rajya kaa janapad trishur dakshin bharat kii ek pramukh dharmik nagari he
 There is an iconic temple here, Guruvayur Temple, in which the statue of Lord Guruvayurappan, showing the form of Lord Krishna, is installed
 aazaadee se purv anya mandiron kii bhaanti is mandir main bhi harijanon ke pravesh par purna pratibandh tha
 The pro-gandhi supporter of Kerala, Mr
 Kelappan, raised his voice against this practice under the orders of the Mahatma and finally civil disobedience was started in 1933
 mandir ke trustiyon ko is baat kii taakid kii gayi ki naye varsh kaa pratham diwas arthath 1 janvari 1934 ko antim nishchay diwas ke rup main manaaya jaayegaa or is tithi par unke str se koi nishchay na hone kii sthiti me mahatma gandhi tathaa shri kelppan dwaara aandolankariyon ke paksh main aamaran anshan kiya ja saktaa he
 For this reason, the meeting of the trustees of Guruvayur temple called a meeting and received the opinion of the worshipers of the temple
 baithak me 77 pratishat upasko ke dwaara diye gayi bahumat ke aadhaar par mandir main harijanon ke pravesh ko sweekruti de di gayi or is prakaar 1 janvari 1934 se kerala ke shri guruvayur mandir main kiye gayi nishchay diwas kii safalataa ke rup main harijanon ke pravesh ko saidvantik sweekruti mil gayi

 When the Congress Party chose to contest elections and accepted power under the federal scheme, Gandhiji decided to resign from the membership of the party
 vah party ke is kadam se asahmat nahin the kintu mahasoos karte the ki yadi ve istipha dete hai tab bharatiyon ke saath uski lokapriyata party kii sadsyta ko majboot karne main aasaani pradaan karegi jo ab tak communiston, samaajwaadiyon, vyapaar sanghon, chaatro, dharmik netaaon se lekar vyapaar sanghon or vibhinn awaajon ke bich vidyaman thi
 This will give all of them an opportunity to listen to their own words
 gandhi ji raaj ke liye kisi party kaa netritv karte hue prachaar dwaara koi aisa lakshya siddh nahin karnaa chaahate the jise raaj ke saath asthaayee taur par rajnatik vyavastha ke rup main sweekaar kar liya jaae
 Gandhiji returned to India in 1936 with the Lahore session of the Nehru Presidency and Congress
 haalanki gandhi kii purna ichha thi ki ve aazaadee praapt karne par apana sampurna dhyaan kendrit karen na ki bharat ke bhavishya ke bare main atakalon par
 This did not prevent the Congress from adopting socialism as its objective
 1938 main raashtrapati pad ke liye chune gaye subhash bose ke saath gandhi ji ke matbhed the
 Gandhi's main points in differences with Bose were Bose's lack of commitment to democracy and lack of faith in non-violence
 bose ne gandhi ji kii aalochana ke baavjood bhi duusari baar jeet hasil kii kintu congress ko us samay chhod diya jab sabhi bhartiya netaaon ne gandhi ji dwaara lagu kiye gaye sabhi siddhaton kaa parityag kar diya gaya
 When World War II broke out in 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland
 In the beginning, Gandhi favored non-violent moral support to the efforts of the British, but other Congress leaders opposed the unilateral inclusion in the war without consulting the representatives of the public
 did
 congress ke sabhi chaynit sadasyon ne samuhik taur par apane pad se istipha de diya
 After a long discussion, Gandhi declared that India would not be a party to any war if it fought outside for democratic independence when India itself was denied independence
 jaise jaise yuddh badhata gaya gandhi ji ne aazaadee ke liye apni maang ko angrejon ko bharat chodo aandolan naamak vidheyak dekar teevr kar diya
 This was the most obvious rebellion of Gandhi and the Congress Party which was aimed at expelling the British from the Indian border
 gandhi ji ke duusare number par baithe jawaharlal nehru kii party ke kuch sadasyon tathaa kuch anya rajnatik bhartiya dalon ne aalochana kii jo angrejon ke paksh tathaa vipaksh donon main hi vishwaas rakhte the
 Some believed that opposing the British in their lifetime or in the struggle for death was a mortal task while some believed that Gandhiji was not doing enough
 bharat chodo is sangharsh kaa sarvaadhik shaktishaalee andolan ban gaya jisamen vyapak hinsa or giraftaar hui
 Thousands of freedom fighters were either killed or injured by police bullets and thousands were arrested
 gandhi or unke samarthakon ne spasht kar diya ki vah yuddh ke prayaason kaa samarthan tab tak nahin denge tab tak bharat ko tatkaal aazaadee na de di jaae
 He clarified that this time also this movement will not stop if individual acts of violence are materialized
 unhone kaha ki unke chaaron ore araajaktaa kaa aadesh asli araajaktaa se bhi bura he
 He asked all Congressmen and Indians to maintain discipline for ultimate freedom by doing or die with non-violence
 gandhi ji or congress kaaryakaarani samiti ke sabhi sadasyon ko angrejon dwaara mubani main 9 agast 1942 ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Gandhiji was held captive for two years at Agah Khan palace, Pune
 yahi vah samay tha jab gandhi ji ko unke nijee jivan main do gahare aghat lage
 His 50-year-old secretary Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack 6 days later and his wife Kasturba Gandhi died on 22 February 1944 after Gandhiji spent 18 months in jail
 iske chha: saptaah baad gandhi ji ko bhi malaria kaa bhayankar shikaar hona padaa
 He was released before the end of the war on 6 May 1944 due to his poor health and necessary treatment
 raaj unhen jail main dam todate hue nahin dekhnaa chaahate the jisase desh kaa krodh bad jaae
 Although the Quit India movement was a partial success in its objective, but the stubborn suppression of the movement united India by the end of 1943
 yuddh ke ant main, british ne spasht sanket de diya tha ki santta kaa hastantaran kar use bharatiyon ke haath main somp diya jayega
 At this time Gandhiji stopped the movement, which led to the release of about 100,000 political prisoners including Congress leaders
 gandhi ji ne 1946 main congress ko british kebinet mishan ke prastaav ko thukaraane kaa paraamarsh diya kyoki use muslim bahulata vaale praanton ke liye prastaavit samoohikaran ke prati unka gahan andeh hona tha isliye gandhi ji ne prakaran ko ek vibhaajan ke purvaabhyas ke rup main dekha
 However, for some time, this also became one of the incidents of differences with the Congress with Gandhiji as Nehru and Patel knew that if the Congress did not approve the plan then the control of the government would be passed on to the Muslim League
 1948 ke bich lagbhag 5000 se bhi adhik logon ko hinsa ke dauraan maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 Gandhiji was against any such scheme which divided India into two different countries
 bharat main rahane vaale bahut se hinduon or sikhon evam muslimon kaa baari bahumat desh ke bantwaare ke paksh main tha
 Additionally, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, introduced extensive cooperation in West Punjab, Sindh, North West Frontier Province and East Bengal
 vyapak str par failane vaale hindu muslim ladaai ko rokane ke liye hi congress netaaon ne bantwaare kii is yojana ko apni manjuuri de di thi
 Congress leaders knew that Gandhiji would oppose Partition and it was impossible for the Congress to move forward without his consent, because Gandhi's support in Partarthy and his position throughout India was strong
 gandhi ji ke kareebi sahyogiyon ne bantwaare ko ek sarvottam upaay ke rup main sweekaar kiya or sardaar patel ne gandhi ji ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya ki naagarik ashaanti vaale yuddh ko rokane kaa yahi ek upaay he
 Mazabur Gandhi gave his permission
 unhone uttar bharat ke saath-saath bengal main bhi muslim or hindu samudaay ke netaaon ke saath garm ravaiye ko shant karne ke liye gahan vichaar vimarsh kiya
 Despite the india-pakistan war of 1947, he was harassed when the government decided not to give Rs 55 crore to Pakistan as per the agreement made by the Partition Council
 sardaar patel jaise netaaon ko dar tha ki pakistan is dhan kaa upyog bharat ke khilaaf jang chhedane main kar saktaa he
 When the demand began to arise that all Muslims should be sent to Pakistan and the Muslims and Hindu leaders expressed their dissatisfaction and Gandhi was deeply shocked by the refusal to compromise with each other
 unhone dilli main apana pehla aamaran anshan aarambh kiya jisamen sampradayik hinsa ko sabhi ke liye tatkaal samaapt karne or pakistan ko 55 karod rou0 kaa bhugtan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 Gandhiji feared that instability and insecurity in Pakistan would increase his anger towards India and spread violence on the border
 unhen aage bhi dar tha ki hindu or muslim apni shatruta ko phir se nayaa kar denge or usase naagarik yuddh ho jane kii ashanka ban sakati he
 After a passionate debate with allies who had supported Gandhi ja throughout his life, Gandhiji refused to agree and the government had to stick to its policy and pay Pakistan
 hindu muslim or sikh samudaay ke netaaon ne unhen vishwaas dilaayaa ki ve hinsa ko bhula kar shanti laaenge
 These communities included the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha

 The Manchester Guardian, February 18, 1948, was shown carrying through the streets

 He tried to learn by experimenting on his own mistakes and on his own to achieve this goal
 unhone apni aatmakatha ko satya ke prayog kaa naam diya
 Gandhi said that the most important battle to be fought is to conquer elements like your demons, fear and insecurity
 
gandhi ji ne apane vichaaron ko sabase pehle us samay sankshep main vyakt kiya jab unhone kaha bhagwaan hi satya he baad main unhone apane is kathan ko satya hi bhagwaan he main badal diya
 Thus, Gandhi's philosophy in truth is "god"

 Non-violence, non-violence and non-violence has a long history in Indian religious thought and has many concepts in its Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Jewish and Christian communities
 gandhi ji ne apni aatmakatha da story of maay experiments wyeth truth " main darshan or apane jivan ke maarg kaa varnan kiya he
 He was told to say: jab main niraash hota hum tab main yaad karata hum ki haalanki itihaas satya kaa maarg hota he kintu prem ise sadaiv jeet letaa he
 There have also been atrocities and assassinations here and for some time they seemed invincible but in the end their downfall happens - always consider it
 " mritkon, anaath tathaa begharon ke liye isse kya fark padataa he ki swatantraaa or loktantr ke pavitra naam ke neeche sampoornavaad kaa pagal vinaash chipa he
 One eye for another will make the whole world blind
 marane ke liye mare paas bahut se kaaran he kintu mere paas kisi ko maarane kaa koi bhi kaaran nahin he
 In applying these principles, Gandhiji did not turn away from taking them to the most logical extent to show the world where the government, police and the army also became non-violent
 " for pasifists
" naamak pustak se uddhran liye gaye hai
 The war of science leads a person to dictatorship, pure and simple
 ahimsa kaa vigyaan akele hi kisi vyakti ko shuddh loktantr ke maarg kii ore le ja saktaa he
 The power based on love is a thousand times more permanent than the power produced by the fear of punishment
 yah kahana ninda karne jaisaa hoga ki ki ahimsa kaa abhyaas keval vyaktigat taur par kiya ja saktaa he or vyaktivaadita vaale desh iskaa kabhi bhi abhyaas nahin kar sakate hai
 The closest approach to pure anarchy would be a democracy based on non-violence; xxrep 5 ; any society organized and running based on total non-violence vaala samaaj hoga

 People will help them in every possible way and through mutual cooperation they will easily face any disturbance 


 Violent fights between labor and capital and strikes will be very less and in non-violent states very few because the preponderance of non-violent society The impact of this will be great to honor the key elements in the society
