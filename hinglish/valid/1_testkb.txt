 The tournament began in 1905 at the Weerhausman Cricket Ground
 It was named the Australasian Championships because by 1912 it was organized by both Australia and New Zealand
 The competition was only expanded to include women's tennis in 1922
 Due to the geographical distance separating it from the other tournaments, the top American and European players rarely deigned to travel down to the Antipodes until the end of the 1970s, meaning that the title was almost exclusively won by Australians up until that date
 In 1972, The Australian Tennis Federation decided to change the venue of the event every year, with Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and even New Zealand taking turns to host the tournament
 In 1983, the Australian Open set up home in Kooyong, Melbourne, where it began to earn the respect of the tennis-playing world until its move in 1988 to Flinders Park
 Grass courts made way for hard Rebound Ace surfaces, and in 1997, Flinders Park was renamed Melbourne Park
 Since 1988, the Australian Open is the only Grand Slam tournament to have two courts covered by retractable roofs

 The first action of this action is citric acid, so this process is also called citric acid cycle
 citric amla main 3 carboxylic mulak upasthit rahata he atah ise tri carboxylic cycle yaa tisie chakra bhi kehete hai
 In the cyclic reactions of the Krebs cycle, complete oxidation of pyruvic acid gives out one molecule of carbon dioxide at three places throughout the cycle, that is, three carbon atoms of pyruvic acid leave three molecules as carbon dioxide
 shwasan kriya ke creb chakra ke dauraan pyruvik amla oxeloacetic amla se kriya karata he
 It consists of three co-enzymes
 sarvapratham piruvik amla injim kii upasthiti main oxykrut hokar carbon dioxide tathaa hydrogen main badal jaataa he

 Oxidative respiration does not require oxygen and it occurs in the absence of oxygen
 is kriya main bhojan kaa apurna oxikaran hota he
 Carbon dioxide and lactic acid are formed as a result of this action in animals and in plants carbon dioxide and ethyl alcohol are formed and a very small amount of energy is released
 is prakaar kaa shwasan kuch nimna shrenee ke paudhon, yeast, jeevanu, evam antah paraseete jantuon jaise golkrimi, feetakrimi, monocystis ityadi main hota he
 Under certain circumstances, high-grade animals, plant tissues, seeds, juicy fruits, etc
 also occur in the absence of oxygen

 The organisms that have this respiration are called Nairobes
 oxic shwasan ke samaan hi anaksi shwasan ke prarambh main glicolisis kii kriya hoti he jiske ant main piruvik amla banataa he
 In the further process, there is no complete oxidation of pyruvic acid due to lack of oxygen, so this respiration produces much less energy than oxygen respiration
 paudhon main yah piruvik amla carboxillej injim kii upasthiti main acitaldihide or carbon daai oxide main badal jaati he
 This is then degraded by NADH2 in the presence of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme, and is converted to NAD and ethyl alcohol

 shwasan kii kriya main carbon daai-oxide kaa vah aaytan jo baahar nikalataa he tathaa jitna aaytan oxigen kaa avasorana hota he uske anupaat ko shwasan bhagfal kehete hai
 It is always represented in numbers such as - 6CO2 / 6O2 = 1 Respiratory quotient indicates which type of food is being oxidized in respiration, as this ratio is different in different foods
 shwasan kii kriya main upyog main aane vaale khadyapadaarthon ke aadhaar par iskaa maan ikai, ikai se kam, ikai se adhik hota he
 When the food substance that is oxidized to respiration is carbohydrate, then the value of the respiratory quotient is unit, such as in seeds of germinated wheat
 jab shwasan main upyog hone vaala khadyapadaarth vasa yaa protein ho tab shwasan bhagfal kaa maan ikai se kam hota he
 2C51H98O6 + 145O2 → 102CO2 + 98H2O + Energy shwasan main upyog aane vaala khadyapadaarth jab protein hota he tab shwasan-gunank kaa maan 0
4 se 0
9 tak ho saktaa he
 If we know the value of RQ, then we can guess what kind of food is being reacted in respiration
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya main paudhe prakaash kii upasthiti main vaataavaran se carbon daai-oxide ko grahan karte hai tathaa oxigen gas vaataavaran main mukt karte hai
 It is natural to increase the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere and decrease of carbon dioxide, but in reality it is not so
 shwasan kii kriya main sajiv din or raat har samay oxigen gas grahan karte hai tathaa carbon daai-oxide gas kaa vaataavaran main tyaag karte hai
 In this way, the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide gases in the atmosphere is maintained by respiration
 shwasan ek urja-unmochan prakriya he
 In respiration, food is oxidized, releasing the accumulated energy
 shwasan ke samay mukt urja kaa kuch bhaag koshika ke mitocondria main atipi ke rup main sanchit ho jaati he
 This energy, accumulated in the form of ATP, is used to carry out various biological functions of living organisms in future

 Light is produced from the bodies of some insects and sea animals
 yah prakaash shwasan dwaara utpann urja kaa hi ek roopaantarit rup he
 The body of some marine organisms such as electric ray fish and torpedoes, etc
 generates electric waves for self-defense, it is produced by the conversion of energy generated by electric respiration
 prakaash-sanshleshan evam shwasan kii kriyaayein ek duusare kii poorak evam vipareet hoti hai
 In photosynthesis, the chemical reaction between carbon d-oxide and water results in the formation of glucose and release of oxygen
 shwasan main iske vipareet glucose ke oxikaran ke falswaroop jal tathaa carbon daai-oxide banati hai
 Photosynthesis is a creative activity that results in an increase in the dry weight of living organisms
 shwasan ek nasaatmak kriya he, is kriya ke falswaroop sajiv ke shushk bhaar main kami aati he
 Food is produced by the use of solar energy in photosynthesis, radiation energy is converted into chemical energy
 jabaki shwasan main bhojan ke oxikaran se urja mukt hoti he, bhojan main sanchit rasinic urja kaa prayog sajiv apane vibhinn kaaryon main karata he
 Thus, these two activities complement each other by relying on each other's end products for their raw materials
 sajivon ke sharir main prayek koshika main jaev-rasinic kriyaayein hoti rahati hai
 Daily energy is required to perform these actions
 urja kaa mukhya strot bhojan he
 Solar energy is stored as potential energy in food

 The glucose required for oxidation in respiration is produced between nutrition
 poshan ke liye aavashyak urja, shwasan kriya main utpann urja se praapt hoti he
 In this way, respiration and nutrition are inextricably related to each other
 koshikeey shwasan ke dwaara atipi nirmaan ke liye adhikansh sajiv shwasan kii vaatapekshi vidhi par nirbhar hai parantu kram-vikaas ke dauraan pehle vatanirpekshi shwasan kaa vikaas hua tha

 All in Hindi: abul hasan yaminuddin amir khusro chaudaavin sadi ke lagbhag dilli ke nikat rahane vaale ek pramukh kavi shaayar, gayak or sangeetkaar the
 His family belonged to the court for many generations
 Amir Khusro himself had witnessed the rule of eight sultans
 Amir Khusro was the first Muslim poet to use Hindi words openly
 He was the first person who wrote together in Hindi, Hindu and Persian
 i am credited with the invention of Khadi Boli
 He is known for his riddles and reticence
 sabase pehle unheen ne apni bhashaa ke liye hindai kaa ullekh kiya tha
 He was also a Persian poet
 unako dilli sultanate kaa aashray mila hua tha
 The list of his books is long
 saath hi inkaa itihaas strot rup main mahatva he
 Amir Khusro, son of Turk Saifuddin of the Lachan caste of Central Asia, was born in the town of Patiali in Etah, Uttar Pradesh
 lachan jati ke turk changez khan ke akramanon se peedit hokar balban ke rajyakaal main ‘’sharnaarthi ke rup main bharat main aa based the
 Khusro's mother Balbanke was the daughter of war minister Imadutul Mulk and an Indian Muslim woman
 saat varsh kii avasthaa main khusro ke pita kaa dehant ho gaya
 As a teenager, he started writing poetry and by the age of 20 he became famous as a poet
 khusro main vyavhaarik buddhi kii koi kami nahin thi
 Khusro never disregarded social life
 khusro ne apana sara jivan rajshray main hi bitaayaa
 Even while staying in the court, Khusro always remained a poet, artist, musician and soldier
 sahitya ke atirikt sangeet ke kshetra main bhi khusro kaa mahatvapurn yogadan he i unhone bhartiya or irani raagon kaa sundar mishran kiya or ek naveen raag style imaan, jilf, sajgari aadi ko janm diya i bhartiya gayan main qavvaalior sitar ko inhen kii dein mana jaataa he
 He has also written many puzzles and couplets in Persian and on the lines of the song, including the words of Arabic Ghazal
 inke teen putron main abulahasan sabase bade the - 4 baras kii umr main ve dilli laae gaye
 At the age of 8, he became a disciple of the famous Sufi Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya
 16-17 saal kii umr main ve amiron ke ghar shaayari padhane lage the
 Once in a Mushaira in Delhi, Balban's nephew Sultan Muhammad liked Khusro's poetry and took him with him to Multan
 sultan mohammad khud bhi ek acha shaayar tha - usne khusro ko ek acha ohada diya
 Masnavi was written in which there were 20 thousand lions - remember that at the same time Maulana Rumi, perhaps the best poet of the world, was also writing or had written a masnavi in madhyaturki
 5 saal tak multan main unka jindagi bahut aisho aaraam se guzari
 At the same time, one of the Mongols was invading Punjab
 inako qaid kar heraat le jaaya gaya - mongolon ne sultan mohammad kaa sar kalam kar diya tha
 After two years, he was left seeing his lack of military aspiration and the style of poetry
 phir yo patiyaali pahunche or phir dilli aae
 Told Balban the whole story - Balban too fell ill and then died
 phir kaikubad ke darbar main bhi ye rahe - wo bhi inaki shaayari se bahut prasann rahaa or inhe mulukashuara ghoshit kiya
 At this time Jalaluddin Khilji invaded Delhi and took control of power
 usne bhi inako sthai sthaan diya
 When Khilji's nephew and son-in-law Alauddin captured power by killing 70-year-old Jalaluddin, he kept Amir Khusro in the court
 chittod par chadhaai ke samay bhi amir khusro ne allaudin khilji ko manaa kiya lekin wo nahin mana
 After this Malik Kafur took power from Alauddin Khilji and Mubarak Shah from Malik Kafur

 In ancient times, during the time of Satyuga, a majestic king named Indrasen ruled in a city named Mahishmati following his subjects religiously
 vah raja putr, pautra or dhan aadi se sampann or vishnu kaa param bhakt tha
 One day when the king was sitting happily in his meeting, Maharishi Narada descended from the sky and came to his meeting
 raja unhen dekhte hi haath jodakar khadaa ho gaya or vidhipurvak asana va arghya diya
 Sitting happily, the monk asked the king, o Rajan! Are all your seven parts efficiently? Does your mind live in religion and your mind in Vishnu devotion? Hearing such things of Devarshi Narada, the king said- o Maharishi! By your grace, everyone is proficient in my state and the yagya karmadis are being strengthened here
 aap krupa karke apane aagaman kaa kaaran kahie
 Then the sage started saying that, o Rajan! Listen to my words that surprise you
 main ek samay brahmalok se yamalok ko gaya, vahaan shraddhapurvak yamraj se poojit hokar maine dharmsheel or satyawan dharmraj kii prashansa kii
 In the meeting of the same Yamraj, the great wise and righteous saw your father due to the fast of Ekadashi

 Whoever survives the shraddh of the ancestors, smell it and give it to the cow and worship Lord Rishikesh with all the ingredients like Dhup, Deep, Smell, Flush, Naivedya
 raat main bhagwaan ke nikat jaagran karen
 After this, on the morning of Dwadashi, in the morning, worship God and offer food to Brahmins

 Naradji started saying that, o Rajan! By this method, if you devoid of laziness and observe this fast, then your father will surely go to heaven
 itnaa kahkar naradji antardhyaan ho gaye
 According to Naradji's statement, the king fasting with his binds and slaves caused a wreath from the sky and the father of that king climbed Garuda and went to Vishnulok

 shyaam sundar das jivan ke antim kshan tak sahitya-seva main sakriy rahe
 Just before and after independence, the entire generation of Hindi grew only by sitting on Babuji's shoulders
 samay-samay par vibhinn vishyon par sammelnon main diye jane vaale unke vaktavyon kii sankhya anginat he
 Looking at all this thinking, it becomes clear how they wanted to pursue Hindi literature by connecting it with many subjects
 aaj bhi babuji kii bahut badi dein he paathya-saamagree kii pramanik rachana tathaa adhyayan ke kshetra kaa vivek
 His every minute effort to bring fresh material to the students resulted in his becoming a collector
 aalochana kii jaati he ki isi kaaran unke lekhan main gahraayi or moulikta kaa abhaav hota gaya
 But it remains to be seen that his syncretic intelligence was engrossed in the material collection of many knowledge fields
 yahan tak ki vyaavhaarik-aalochana main bhi babuji ne saamanjasywad kaa saundarya sthapit kiya
 That is why comparison, historical view, interpretation, commentary etc
 entered his criticism
 is tarah hindi main vyaavhaarik-aalochana kaa aarmabhik maarg bhi unhone taiyaar kiya
 His efficient leadership later proved to be a boon for the Hindi-speaking region
 babu shyaam sundar das ne vichaaratmak tathaa bhavatmak donon hi ek prakaar ke niabandh likhe hai
 There is enough variety in the subject of his essays
 unhone bahut se achoote vishyon par bhi lekhnee chalaai kaviyon kii khoj tathaa itihaas sambandhi nibandhon main unki pratibha ke darshan hote hai
 The language of Babu Shyam Sundar Das is pure literary Hindi, in which the corresponding words of Sanskrit are predominant
 bhashaa ke sambandh main unka vichaar tha- 'jab ham videshi bhaavon ke saath videshi shabdon ko grahan karen tab unhen aisa bana len ki unamem se videshipan nikal jaae or ve apane hokar hamaare vyakaran ke niyamon se anushaasit hon
 'therefore, wherever they have used the prevalent words of' Urdu 'in their language, they have removed their character, they have used them by removing the dots under the words pen, drill, law etc
 and changing their pronunciation
 isi prakaar sanskrit ke shabdon kii clishtataa dur kar ke unhen hindi main saral dhang se likhaa he- jaise- kaary ke sthaan par kaary, anjan ke sthaan par anjan
 Babu Shyamsunder Das was of the opinion about the word selection- 'the first place is the words of pure Hindi, behind it the easy and popular words of Sanskrit, behind it the simple and popular words of foreign languages like Persian and behind it the obsolete of Sanskrit
 Let the words be spaced
 farsi aadi videshi bhashaaon ke kathin shabdon kaa prayog kadaapi na ho
 Babu Shyam Sundar Das has written mainly in two types of styles - 1
 vichaaratmak style- vichaaratmak style main vichaaratmak niabandh likhe gaye hai
 The sentences in this style are short and expressive
 bhashaa sabal, saral or pravahamayi he
 For example- 'gopiyo kaa sneh badhaya he
 They are compiled with Krishna in Ras Leela
 anek utsav manaati he
 This behavior of Premmayi gopikas is very delightful
 usamen kahin se aswabhaaviktaa nahin aa saki
 2
 Exploratory Style - The explanatory style is used in exploratory essays
 inamen vaakya apekshaakrit kuch lambey hai
 There is a plethora of corresponding words in the language
 vishay kii gahanta tathaa shushkta ke kaaran yah style main kuch shushk or rahit he
 See an example of this type of style- 'yah jivan-sangram do bhinn sabhyataaon ke sangharshan se or bhi teevr or dukhamay prathit hone laga he
 According to this condition, when literature is generated and encouraging the brain of the society, then only the signs of real progress will be seen and its welfare will give the country the glory of modern times
 babu shyaam sundardaas kii kisi prakaar kii style main alankaaron kii sajaavat nahin pai jaati
 Sayings and idioms have been used sparingly
 apane vichaaron ko bhalee prakaar samajhane ke liye babu shyaam sundar das ne ek hi baat ko 'saransh yah he' 'athwa', 'jaise' aadi shabdon ke saath baar-baar duharaaya he
 In Hindi literature, Babu Shyam Sundar Das has been replaced as his Hindi promoter and Hindi director
 unhone anek moulik granthon kii rachana kii
 Edited many texts
 kaashi nagari-prachaarini sabha kii sthapana main unka pramukh haath tha
 He made Hindi a place in the higher classes of the university with his efforts
 kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay main aane se purv unhone 1900 main hindi sahitya kii samruddhi ke liye nyaayalayon main hindi ke pravesh kaa andolan chalaaya

 Ramchandra Shukla has written in the history of Hindi literature: shyaam sundar das na keval santhaan-nirmaataa the, balki prabandh-kala main bhi bejod the
 He worked determinedly to overcome the shortages of all areas of literature
 bhashaa tatvavetta ke rup main yaa siddhanton ke vyaakhyaata rup main unheen kii uplabdhiyon ke kaaran saahityalochan hindi ke vidhyaarthiyon kaa bahut samay tak kanthhaar bana rahaa
 In his mind, the notion remained that the basis of the theoretical review of Hindi should be made by combining Sanskrit and Western criticism-principles and with a special harmony
 shyaam sundar das se pehle hindi or nagari lipi ke liye vishesh rup se sankatpurna samay tha
 Pratap Narayan Mishra had established meetings for the promotion of Hindi in many places
 aisi hi ek sabha 1884 main ‘hindi uddharini pratinidhi madhya bharat sabha’ ke naam se prayag main pratishthit kii gayi
 Bharatendu Harishchandra also ventured several times for Nagari's entry into government offices, but he could not succeed
 iske baavjood praytn baraabar chalata rahaa
 Due to the court language being Urdu, the number of newly educated Urdu readers was more, due to which the work of publishing Hindi books could not proceed
 is sahitya-sankat ke atirikt nagari kaa pravesh sarkari dacrataron main na hone se nagari jaanane vaali janata ke saamne ghor sankat tha
 In the same period, Kashi Nagari Pracharini Sabha was established in 1893 from the industry of some enthusiastic students, among whom Babu Shyam Sundar Das was the chief
 yahan bhi ramchandra shukla kaa kathan yaad rakhana chahie ki, ‘sach puuchhie to is sabha kii sari samruddhi or kirti babu shyaam sundar das ke tyaag or satat parishram kaa fal he
 They continued to do it from the beginning till the end and kept it ready in many big industries
 iske pratham sabhapati bhaaratendu ke fufere bhai radhakrishna das hue
 The Nagari Prachar movement created new enthusiasm among Hindi-lovers and many people became devoted to the growth of literature

 Based on the postures mentioned together in Panini such as Shataman, Vishnitika and Karshapana, and due to many other reasons, we find this period of Panini very expedient
 ashtaadhi main aath adhyay hai or prayek adhyay main chaar paad hai
 The first second chapters have nouns and definitional formulas and also regulative cases of interrelations between verb and noun words in the sentence, such as atmanapada-parasampad-paisa for verbs, and inflection for nouns, compounding, etc
 tisare, chauthe or paanchaven adhyyon main sab prakaar ke pratyayon kaa vidhaan he
 The third chapter explains the participle words by adding suffixes to metals, and the fourth and fifth chapters describe the detailed interpretation of new noun words by adding suffixes to noun words
 ye pratyay jin arthvishyon ko prakat karte hai unhen vyakaran kii paribhaasha main vritti kehete hai, jaise varsha main honevaale indradhanu ko vaarshik indradhanu kahenge
 The suffix "ik", which expresses this special meaning occurring in the rain, is the copied suffix
 taddhit prakaran main 1,190 sutara hai or kridant prakaran main 631
 In this way, only a little less than half of Ashtadhyayi's 1,821 formulas have been appropriated for the constitution of kriddanta, the corresponding suffixes
 chathe, saatven or aathven adhyyon main un parivartanon kaa ullekh he jo shabd ke aksharon main hote hai
 These changes occur either because of suffixes joining the root word or because of the pact
 dvitv, samprasaran, sandhi, swar, aagam, lop, deergh aadi ke vidhayak sutara chathe adhyay main aae hai
 From the fourth foot of the sixth chapter to the end of the seventh chapter, there is a specific case called Angadhivaar which describes the changes that occur in the root words due to the suffix or in the suffixes due to the root word
 ye parivartan bhi deergh, hrasv, lop, aagam, aadesh, gun, vruddhi aadi ke vidhaan ke rup main hi dekhe jate hai
 In the eighth chapter, there is a special exhortation of bifurcation, plutocracy and shasta and sattvidavana of syntactic words
 ashtaadhi ke atirikt usee se sambandhit ganpaath or dhatupath naamak do prakaran bhi nishchit rup se panini nirmit the
 Their tradition continues till date, although some new words in the Ganpath have also been added to the old lists over time
 vartmaan unadi sutron ke paninikrut hone main andeh he or unhen ashtaadhi ke ganpaath ke samaan abhinn ang nahin mana ja saktaa
 The present Unadi Sutras are the known accounts of Shaktaayana-grammar
 panini ne sanskrit bhashaa ke tatkaaleen swaroop ko parishkrut evam niyamit karne ke uddeshy se bhashaa ke vibhinn avyavon evam ghatakon yatha dhwani-vibhaag, naam, pad, kriya, vaakya, ling ityadi tathaa unke antarsambandhon kaa samavesh ashtaadhi ke 32 padon main, jo aath adhyyon main samaan rup se vibhakt hai, kiya he
 In this important book of grammar, Panini has given a comprehensive and comprehensive discussion of the huge collection of the divisive-dominated Sanskrit language in about 4000 sutras, which are unequally divided in number by eight chapters
 tatkaaleen samaaj main lekhan saamagree kii dushprapyata ko dhyaan main rakhkar panini ne vyakaran ko smritigamya banane ke liye sutara style kii sahaayta lee he
 Again, Panini has used many tools from his predecessor grammar as well as himself, to make the discussion very brief, of which the Shivasutra or Maheshwar Sutras are the most important
 prasiddh he ki maharishi panini ne in sutron ko devadhidev shiv se praapt kiya tha
 Panini composed about 4000 sutras for the interpretation of all the words in the Sanskrit language which are scientifically stored in the eight chapters of Ashtadhyayi
 ye sutara vastav main ganit ke sutron kii bhanti hai
 Just as complex and elaborate mathematical assumptions or principles are easily expressed by formulas, Panini has explained the complex rules of grammar very briefly by formulas
 bhashaa ke samast pahaluon ke vivechan hetu hi unhen 4000 sutron kii rachana kerani padi
 Panini has divided the cases and related sources in Ashtadhyayi in a scientific manner
 panini ne ashtaadhi ko do bhaagon main baanta he: pratham adhyay se lekar aathven adhyay ke pratham paad tak ko sapadasptadhyaayi evam shesh teen padon ko tripadi kaha jaataa he
 Panini has instructed by creating the Pu पूर्वtrasiddhidam Sutra that the rules described in Tripadi are imperfect as compared to the rules considered in Sapadasaptadhyayi
 arthath, yadi dono bhaagon main varnit niyamon ke madhya yadi kabhi virodh ho jaae to purv bhaag kaa niyam hi maanya hoga
 Similarly, in case of opposition in the formulas coming under Sapadasaptadhyayi, the succession of the later formula will be predominant - work on opposition
 in siddhanton ko sthapit karne ke baad, panini ne sarvapratham sangya padon ko paribhaashit kiya he or baad main un sangya padon par aadhaarit vishay kaa vivechan
 Panini has taken several measures to maintain brevity
 isamen sabase mahatvapurn he – vishisht sangyaaon kaa nirmaan
 Panini collected the words / syllables of the language which were frequently required in stating the rules of grammar, and gave them different specific names which are used in different contexts as required by the Ashtadhyayi as nouns
 niyamon ko bataane ke pehle hi panini waisi sangyaaon ko paribhaashit kar dete hai, yatha – maheshwar sutara – 'pratyaahaar, it, ti, nadi, ghu, pad, dhaatu, pratyay, ang, nishtha ityadi
 Some of these have been borrowed by Panini from his predecessor grammars
 lekin adhikansh swayan unke dwaara banaae gaye hai
 The details of these nouns are given further
 vyakaran ke kuch avyavon yatha dhaatu, pratyay, upsarg ke vivechan me, panini ko anek niyamon kii aavashyaktaa padi
 Before the formulation of such rules, Panini mentions those related ingredients at the beginning and that they will have the right to a certain formula
 in avyavon ko ve purv main hi sangya rup main paribhaashit kar chuke hai
 In other words, Panini interprets a particular case in the possession of the basic noun of that case - ie metal, suffix etc
 - so that they do not have to repeat the noun in each sutra again and again
 sankshiptata laane main yah upkaran bahut sahaayak he
 For interpretation of words / terms, Panini has composed six types of sutras based on nature: jo apane gundharm ko duusare sutron par lagu karte hai
 Panini's grammar makes a very precise analysis of the Sanskrit language
 yah us samay kii bolchaal kii maanak bhashaa kaa to varnan karata hi he, iske saath hi vaidic sanskrit or sanskrit ke kshetreey prayogon kaa bhi varnan karata he
 Even Panini has highlighted the socio-linguistic use of the language
 panini kaa vyakaran sampoorn hone ke saath hi itnaa chota he ki log ise yaad karte aaye hai
 Although Panini composed his grammar for Sanskrit, but his tips and tools can be used to analyze grammar in all languages
 ashtaadhi main vaidic sanskrit or panini kii samakaleen shisht bhashaa main prayukt sanskrit kaa sarvangpurn vichaar kiya gaya he
 The grammar of the Vedic language could have been even more perfect
 panini ne apni samakaleen sanskrit bhashaa kaa bahut acha surveykshan kiya tha
 There are three types of special lists in his vocabulary: itihaas kii drushti se or bhi anek prakaar kii saanskrithik saamagree, shabdon or sansthaaon kaa sannivesh sutron main ho gaya he
 From the very beginning with Ashtadhyayi, there was also a lecturer of meanings, due to which one name of Ashtadhyayi, as Patanjali has written, was also Vrittisutra
 or bhi, maathurivriti, punyavritti aadi vrittiyaan thim jinaki parampara main vartmaan kashikavriti he
 Within about two centuries of Ashtadhyayi's work, Katyayan, while conducting a multi-faceted review of the sutras, composed about four millennials who are in sutra style
 vaarthiksutra or kuch vrittisutron ko lekar patanjali ne mahabhashya kaa nirmaan kiya jo panineey sutron par arth, udhaaharan or prakriya kii drushti se sarvopari granth he
 "atha Shabdanushasanam" - This is Mahabhashya's first sentence
 panini, katyayan or patanjali - ye teen vyakaranshastra ke pramukh acharya hai jinhen 'munitray' kaha jaataa he
 Based on Panini's formulas, Bhattojidixit composed Siddhantakamoudi, and his disciple Varadaraja composed the Siddhantakantakomudi on the basis of Siddhantakamudi
