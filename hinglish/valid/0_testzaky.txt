 Many types of beliefs are found in those who believe in the existence of the dead soul

 Some people believe that as a result of the Sunkriti and the evil, the existing order of the creature in addition to the body goes to heaven and hell

 Manusmriti's statement is that if the Savarna and virtuous wife of Ahitagni Dwij dies, then Ahitagni husband can burn her with Yagyapatras with his Shrout and Smarta fire
 iske uparant vah pun: vivaah kar agnihotra armbh kar saktaa he
 Regarding Vishwaroop Ahitagni, he has quoted kathak-shruti saying that if a person keeps the same old auditions after the death of his wife, then those flames are considered impure like the fire which is used for corpse and He has added so much that if Ahtagni's Kshatriya wife dies before him, then his right is also from Shroutagni
 yah siddhanth anya tikaakaron ke mat kaa virdohi he, kintu usne manusmriti main prayukt 'savarna' ko keval udhaaharan swaroop liya he, kyonki aisa na karne se vaakyabhed dosha utpann ho jaayegaa
 Therefore, in addition to Brahmin wife, Kshatriya wife has also been recognized
 kuch smritiyon ne aisa likhaa he ki aahitagni vidhur rup main rahakar bhi apana agnihotra sampadit kar saktaa he or patni kii sone yaa kush kii pratimaa banaakar yagyadi kar saktaa he, jaisaa ki ram ne kiya tha
 When the householder does not remarry after burning his original wife with shrutagnis and does not keep new Vedic fire again, he is burnt with ordinary fire after death
 yadi grihasth pun: vivaah nahin karata he to vah apni mrit patni ke shav ko araniyon se utpann agni main jala saktaa he
 If Ahitagni dies first, her widow is burnt with fire produced from the Aranis
 jab patni kaa dah-karm hota he to 'asmatvambhijatosi' naamak mantra kaa paath nahin hota
 Only the virtuous and virtuous woman's cremation is done by Shrauta or Smarta Agni

 If the Ahitagni falls or commits suicide in some way or dies after fighting with animals or snakes, then its shrines should be thrown into the water, smart fire should be thrown into the crossroads or water, the yagyapatras should be burnt and it should be burnt with ordinary fire

 The Bodhanayanaprimadhyasutra has arranged that there is no cremation of dead children before churikaran, there is no paternity of virgin girls and boys without children
 usne yah bhi vyavastha di he ki bina daant ke bacchon ko 'om' ke saath tathaa daant vaale bacchon ko vyahritiyon ke saath gaada jaataa he
 Mitakshara has given the following rules: 'before naming only burial, no water-slaughter; Burning or burning is an option for three years after naming; From three years to the east of Upanayana, the cremation and tarpan takes place silently; The same rule applies if death has occurred before three years

 Apart from this, its maintenance was also very cheap and easy

 Such words can be easily identified with the Arabic prefix "al"
 13veen shatee kii portugali niti kavita par provensaali kaa bahut prabhaav tha
 Therefore, many proverbial words were used in the language of poetry, but relatively few Provensali words are found in the colloquial language
 portugali shabdaawalee ko sabase adhik samrudh kiya spani or francisi bhashaaon ne
 The Spanish were influenced by their geographical proximity and literary prosperity, especially theatrical literature
 portugal par spain kaa aadhipaty rahanaa bhi prabhaav kaa ek kaaran he
 The French were under the influence, because in the 11th century, the Count of Portugal was Henry of Burgundy, the eminence of the First Dynasty of Portugal
 uske baad 18veen shatee se 20veen shatee ke aarambh tak francisi samskruti ke pravesh ke kaaran francisi bhashaa ne portugali ko prabhavit kiya
 In the modern era, like other languages of Europe, the influence of English can also be seen on Portuguese

 Through the discoveries which started from the 15th century, the Portuguese got in touch with the inhabitants of Africa, Asia and America
 falswaroop anek nae shabd portugali main aa gaye 
 The main characteristics of Portuguese compared to Latina are: portugali main vaakyavinyasaatmak dhvaniprakriya dhyaan dene yogya he : shabdaant main aanevaale 'S' kaa uccharan praaia: 'ship' ke 'sha' ke samaan hota he, kintu jab uske pashchaat or shabd rahete hai tab uskaa uccharan z jaisaa hota he, jaise as main za ; swar ke purv main rahane se tathaa ghosh varna ke purv uskaa uccharan Pleasure ke s jaisaa hota he, kintu aghosh varna ke pare s hi rahata he
 'OS Pis' is pronounced 'that pes' - because p is inferior, 'as artes' is pronounced 'az artes' because 'artes' has a vowel at the beginning
 'OS dentes' kaa uccharan 'os dentess' hota he kyonki 'da' ghosh he
 In addition to the common features of other languages, Navalatini is a feature found in Portuguese that is not found in any other language

 'ai una veragonha noo sabermo escrevre' - It is a matter of shame that we cannot write
 naiyamik kriyaaon main let bhavishya rup bhi hota he jo vyaktivaachak kriya ke saamaanya rup ke samaan hota he
 Like other Navalatinese languages, Portuguese is also different from the point of view that there is still a complete latent period of Latin in it
