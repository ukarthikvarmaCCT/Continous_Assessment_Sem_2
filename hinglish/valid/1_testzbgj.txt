 However, he was facing tough challenges from the Devpal of the Pala empire
 or vah gurjar pratiharon se kalinger kshetra lene me safal rahaa
 After Rambhadra, his son Mihirbhoja or Bhoj i assumed the power of Gurjara Pratihara
 mihirbhoj kaa shasankaal pratihaar samrajya ke liye swarnakaal mana gaya he
 Arab writers describe the period of Mihirbhoja as a prosperous period
 mihirbhoj ke shasankaal me kannauj ke rajya kaa adhik vistaar hua
 His kingdom was spread in the north-west of Satulj, in the north the Himalayan foothills, in the east the western border of the Pala empire, in the south-east the border of Bundelkhand and Vatsa, Saurashtra in the south-west, and most of Rajasthan in the west

 In 1991, Anna Hazare went on hunger strike demanding the removal of some 'corrupt' ministers of the Shiv sena-bjp government in Maharashtra
 ye mantri the- shashikant sutar, mahadev shivankar or baban gholap
 Anna accused him of possessing disproportionate assets
 sarkaar ne unhen manaane kii bahut koshish kii, lekin antat: unhen daagi mantriyon shashikant sutar or mahadev shivankar ko hataanaa hi padaa
 Gholap filed a defamation suit against Anna
 anna apane aarope ke samarthan main nyaayalay main koi sakshya pesh nahin kar paae or unhen teen maheene kii jail ho gai
 The then Chief Minister Manohar Joshi released him after a day's detention
 ek jaanch ayog ne shashikant sutar or mahadev shivankar ko nirdosh bataaya
 But Anna Hazare also accused many Shiv Sena and BJP leaders of indulging in corruption
 1997 main anna hajaare ne soochna kaa adhikaar adhinium ke samarthan main mumbai ke aaazaad maidan se apana abhiyaan shuru kiya
 On 9 August 2003, Anna Hazare sat on fast unto death at Azad Maidan in Mumbai
 12 din tak chale aamaran anshan ke dauraan anna hajaare or soochna kaa adhikaar andolan ko deshvyapee samarthan mila
 Eventually, in 2003, the Maharashtra government had to pass a strong and stringent bill of the Act
 baad main isi andolan ne rashtriya andolan kaa rup le liya
 As a result, on 12 October 2005, the Indian Parliament also passed the Right to Information Act
 agast 2006, main soochna kaa adhikaar adhinium main sanshodhan prastaav ke khilaaf anna ne 11 din tak aamaran anshan kiya, jise deshbhar main samarthan mila
 As a result of this, the government changed the intent of the amendment
 2003 main anna ne congress or ensipi sarkaar ke chaar mantriyon; suresh dada jain, nawab malik, vijay kumaar gavit or padmasingh patil ko bhrasht bataakar unke kilaaf muhim ched di or bhukh hadtaal par baith gaye
 The then Maharashtra government constituted a commission of inquiry thereafter
 nawab malik ne bhi apane pad se tyaagptr de diya
 When the commission framed charges against Suresh Jain, he too had to resign
 dekhen mukhya lekh jan lokapal vidheyak andolan The movement for the creation of the Jan Lokpal Bill began in its all-india form on 5 April 2011 with a hunger strike by social activist Anna Hazare and his comrades at Jantar Mantar, including Magsaysay Award winner Arvind Kejriwal, India's first woman The administrative officer Kiran Bedi, the famous folkloric lawyer Prashant Bhushan, etc
 sanchaar sadhano ke prabhaav ke kaaran is anshan kaa prabhaav samooche bharat main fail gaya or iske samarthan main log sadakon par bhi utarane lage
 He had demanded the Government of India to form a strong anti-corruption Lokpal Bill and had also given a draft of the Lokpal Bill to the Government in accordance with his demand
 kintu manmohan singh ke netritv vaali tatkaaleen sarkaar ne iske prati nakaaratmak ravaiya dikhaaya or isaki upeksha kii
 As a result, his attitude towards the fast started also remained neglected
 lekin is anshan ke andolan kaa rup lene par bharat sarkaar ne aanan-fanan main ek samiti banaakar sambhavit khatre ko taala or 16 agast tak sansad main lokapal vidheyak paarit karaane kii baat sweekaar kar lee
 The bill presented by the government in the monsoon session beginning in August was weak and completely opposite to the Jan Lokpal
 anna hajaare ne iske khilaaf apane purv ghoshit tithi 16 agast se punah anshan par jane kii baat duharai
 On August 16, at seven thirty in the morning, as they were preparing to go on hunger strike, the Delhi Police arrested them from home
 unke team ke anya log bhi giraftaar kar liye gaye
 This news aroused the general public and she took to the streets and started non-violent resistance to this move of the government
 dilli police ne anna ko magistrate ke saamne pesh kiya
 On being released, Anna refused to move out of Delhi to Ralegaon or to fast for 3 days
 unhen 7 dinon ke nyaayik hiraasat main tihaad jail bhej diya gaya
 News of the countrywide protests by evening forced the government to pull back
 dilli police ne anna ko sashart reeha karne kaa aadesh jari kiya
 But Anna was determined to continue the fast
 bina kisi shart ke anshan karne kii anumati tak unhone reeha hone se inkaar kar diya
 Till August 17, there was a demonstration in the country in support of Anna
 dilli main tihaad jail ke baahar hajaaron log deraa daale rahe
 By the evening of 17 August, Delhi Police agreed to allow 7 days of hunger strike at Ramlila Maidan
 magar anna ne 30 dinon se kam anshan karne kii anumati lene se manaa kar diya
 He continued his fast in jail
 anna ko ramlila maidan main 15 din ki anumati mili or 19 agast se anna ram lila maidan main jan lokapal bill ke liye anshan jari rakhane par drudh the
 Till 24 August, there was no agreement with the government on three issues
 anshan ke 10 din ho jane par bhi sarkaar anna kaa anshan samaapat nahin karvaa pai | hajaare ne das din se jari apane anshan ko samaapt karne ke liye saarvajanik taur par teen sharton kaa elaan kiya
 He said that all government employees should be brought under the purview of Lokpal, a citizen charter should be imposed in all government offices and there should be a Lokayukta in all states
 74 varshiya hajaare ne kaha ki agar jan lokapal vidheyak par sansad charchaa karti he or in teen sharton par sadan ke bheetar sahmati ban jaati he to vah apana anshan samaapt kar denge
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, taking the first concrete initiative to break the impasse between the two sides, made an open offer in the Lok Sabha that the Parliament would also consider the Jan Lokpal Bill along with the Bills introduced by others including Aruna Roy and Dr
 Jayaprakash Narayan
 uske baad vichaar vimarsh kaa byora sthaayee samiti ko bheja jayega
 On 25 May 2012, Anna Hazare again conducted a daylong fast on Jantar Mantar with the Jan Lokpal Bill and Whistle Blower Bill
 gandhi kii viraasat unki thati he
 He is ordinary in height
 sir par gandhi topi or badan par khaadi he
 There are thick glasses on the eyes, but they look far away
 iraade fauladi or atal hai
 After Mahatma Gandhi, Anna Hazare has used hunger strike and fast unto death as the most frequent weapon
 iske jariye unhone bhrasht prashasan ko pad chhodane evam sarkaron ko janhitkaari kanoon banane par majaboor kiya he
 Anna Hazare can also be called the Gandhi of the modern era
 anna hajaare ham sabhi ke liye adarsh he
 Anna Hazare considers Gandhiji's village Swarajya as the medium of prosperity in the villages of India
 unka maananaa he ki 'balashaali bharat ke liye gaanvon ko apane pairon par khadaa karnaa hoga
 According to him, the reason for not being equally distributed in the development of the villages was not to keep the villages at the center
 vyakti nirmaan se gram nirmaan or tab swaabhaavik hi desh nirmaan ke gandhiji ke mantra ko unhone hakeekat main utaar kar dikhaaya or ek gaanv se armbh unka yah abhiyaan aaj 85 gaanvon tak safaltaapurvak jari he
 Giving the basic mantra for creation of the person, he has called upon the youth to develop good character, pure ethics, clean life and a sense of sacrifice and imbibed fearlessness and accept the service of common man as an ideal
 hasia kot, garasain tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat gadhwal mandal ke chamoli jile kaa ek gaanv he
 In social contexts, equality means the condition of a society in which all the people of that society have equal rights or prestige
 saamaajik samanta ke liye 'kanoon ke saamne samaan adhikaar' ek nunatam aavashyaktaa he jiske antargat suraksha, matdaan kaa adhikaar, bhaashan kii swatantraaa, ekatra hone kii swatantraaa, sampatti adhikaar, saamaajik vastuon evam sevaaon par samaan pahunch aadi aate hai
 Social equality also includes health equality, economic equality, and other social security
 iske alaava samaan avasar tathaa samaan daayitv bhi iske antargat aata he
 Social equality is the stage of a society under which all the people of that society get equal importance on social basis
 samanta kii avadharana maanakeey raajnneetik siddhant ke marm main nihit he
 This is an idea on the basis of which crores of people have been and will continue to fight against autocratic rulers, unjust social systems and undemocratic rulership or policies for centuries
 is lihaaz se samanta ko sthai or saarvbhaum avadharanaon kii shrenee main rakhaa jaataa he
 a state of relationship between two or more people or groups is one that can be defined as equality
 lekin, ek vichaar ke rup main samanta itani sahaj or saral nahin he, kyonki us sambandh ko paribhaashit karne, uske lakshyon ko nirdhaarit karne or uske ek pahalu ko duusare par praathamikta dene ke ek se adhik tareeke hameshaa uplabdh rahete hai
 Different definitions of the idea of equality emerge when different methods emerge
 pracheen unani sabhyataa se lekar beesvin sadi tak is vichaar kii ruparekha main kai baar jabardast parivartan ho chuke hai
 Many thinkers have contributed to its development and changes in it, including Aristotle, Hobbes, Rousseau, Marx and Tocveil
 samanta kisi had tak aadhunik avadharana he
 Today, human society has not always felt the need for equality between man and man
 pashchimi duniya main raajaaon ko raaj karne kaa daivi adhikaar praapt mana jaataa tha or aisa hi apane-apane kshetron kii had tak samant shrimanton ke sambandh main bhi samajha jaataa tha
 On the other hand, the clergy believed that no one else could be the same as they are omniscient
 unani kaal main samanta sthapit karne kii simit or bahut kamjor koshish hi kii gai
 Eventually, in the seventeenth century, the demand for rights and freedom began to arise in Europe and equality was demanded in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
 aarambh main yah maang vyapaariyon tathaa vyavsaayiyon main se nav-dhanadhyon ne yaa burjua ne kii, jinka kahana tha ki jab samant shrimanton or raajaaon ke saath-saath unke paas bhi sampatti or aarthik rutva he tab unka kanoonee darja unki barabari kaa kyon nahin he
 For example, in Twain's words, the situation in England was of the following manner: ‘chunki asamantaaon main sabase khaas aarthik nahin balki kanoonee asamantaayein thim isliye sampatti kii asamanta nahin balki kanoonee visheshadhikaar par sabase pehle prahaar kiya gaya
 


 The primary goal of the reformers was to achieve legal equality, as it was thought that economic equality would be established automatically to the desired extent after it was achieved
 ’ Similarly, the issue in France was not legal equality, but legal rights, and the struggle for equality distinguished the 'new elite based on property at the level of the old elite based on land
 ’ The eighteenth century primarily voiced legal and political equality, and finally the rise of the new working class in the nineteenth century resulted in a more vigorous demand for social equality
 unnisvin sadi main nirbandh poonjeewaad ke badhate kadam ne ek ore to kuch pariwaron ke liye dhan kaa ambara laga diya lekin saath hi duusari ore baari garibi or aarthik asamanta ko janm diya
 Hence the demand for economic equality arose and this was done by humanists, idealistic socialists and positive liberals
 aarthik samanta kii yah maang nakaaratmak raajnneetik or kanoonee samanta ke liye nahin, balki sakaaratmak samanta ke liye thi or isamen nijee sampatti par ankush, amiron dwaara garibon ke shoshan par roak kaa samavesh tha or iskaa arth tha samaaj kii samgr aarthik vyavastha ke sandarbh main rajya kii sakaaratmak bhoomika
 a very important milestone in the struggle for equality was that of women suffragists in the first half of the twentieth century, whose efforts resulted in the suffrage of women
 usee sadi main britain jaisi samrajyavaadee shaktiyon se mukti praapt karne ke liye bharat jaise upniveshon ke swatantraaa andolan faleebhoot hue, jisase samanta kii yatra ko or bhi gati mili
 The voice of each citizen was considered to be of equal value in the work of royalty in the Greek city-states, such as Athens and Sparta
 arestu ke athenian constitution main un samtamulak sudhaaron ke kai hawaale milte hai jinke aadhaar par loktantric adarsh kii aazamaaish kii ja saki
 The aim of these reforms was to reduce the inequalities in various spheres of social life so that the clans and feudal lords could be loosened on land ownership, power and social pride
 kanoon ke aadhaar par samanta kaa vyavhaar hi vah kasuti tha jiske aadhaar par loktantr ksaa ja saktaa tha
 But in ancient Athens, women, slaves and foreigners were also excluded from this egalitarian realm
 arestu kii rachana politics main is bahirveshan kaa zikr bhi kiya he or use jaays bhi tehraaya he
 Equality for him meant equality of members of the class who were called citizens
 ve nyaay ko keval un logon ke liye uplabdh maanate the jo unki samanta ke daayre main aate the
 For those who were outside it, the situation of asymmetry was justified
 arestu kii buniyadi manyata thi ki prakruti ne logon ko shaasha or shasit main baant kar banaaya he
 To be in the category of ruler, it is essential for a person to be intelligent, reflective and possessing good news
 ve yah bhi maanate the ki yahi gun shaasha ko shasit se alag karte hai
 Criticizing Aristotle's notion of equality, Hobbes conceptualized the Prakrit state in his treatise Leviathan as equating every person under it
 bhale hi koi vyakti shaareerik shakti main yaa koi dimaagi tezi main duusare se kuch behatar ho, par kul mila kar manushyon ke bich aisa koi fark nahin hota jiske aadhaar par ve kisi vishesh laabh kii maang kar saken
 Hobbes argued that one who is weak in terms of body can plan and kill the powerful, and through experience at the level of the brain, each person is endowed with the ability to achieve the same sense of conscience
 isi ke saath manushya main satta hasil karne kii samaan aakanksha bhi hoti he jisase unke bich hode kaa janm hota he or prakritik samanta jokhimagrast ho jaati he
 Hobbes believed that by leaving a part of his power to political authority, only a person can lead a decent and equitable life
 arthath ek nishchit praadhikaar kaa prabhutv hi use puri suraksha kaa aashwaasan de saktaa he
 Hobbes believed that only through the liberation of all types of non-political authorities, including religion, can a person get his natural equality
 ruso bhi apane hisaab se ek prakrut-avasthaa kalpit karte hai
 He has divided it into natural and unnatural, considering heterogeneity rather than equality in his other discourse
 prakritik vishmata keval shaareerik shakti ke kshetra main hoti he
 However, lawmaking and property ownership have given rise to unnatural forms of asymmetry
 darasal, yah vishmata kaa pehla str he jisase garib or amir ke bich kaa fark paidaa hua he
 The second level is the institutional right to punish, leading to inequality of the powerful and the weak
 vishmata kaa aakiri str vaid satta ko svaichhik satta main badalane se paidaa hua he jisase ghulaam or maalik kii shreniyan paidaa hui hai
 Owners of property accumulate power and become owners, and the poor become weak and fall into slavery
 ruso ke mutabik is vishmata kii bhi ek seemaa he
 When an increase in inequality is no longer possible, new revolutions either destroy the rulers or they have to come close to the legitimate institutions of power
 marks ne apana samanta sambandhi vichaar udaarataavaadi samanta kii aalochana ke rup main viksit kiya
 They believed that the capitalist class uses the idea of equality in their own interest
 jis tarah ruso kehete the ki amiron ke jhuthe aashwaasano ke pher main fas kar garib unki satta kaa vaidhikaran karne ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai, usee tarah marks kehete hai ki shaasha varg apni vichaardhaara paidaa karata he taaki aarthik shoshan kii vyavastha jari rakhi ja sake
 There is a kind of division of work within the capitalist class
 ek hissaa poonji kaa swaamitv grahan karata he or doosraa vichaardhaaratmak auzaaron kaa istemaal karte hue samanta or swadhinata ke vichaaron ke zariye bhram kaa maahaul banaaye rakhata he
 According to Marx, in the feudal system, the place of ideas like pride and loyalty was the same place in capitalism as equality and freedom
 in amoort vichaaron kii prabhavakaarita itani adhik he ki kuch samaajawaadee bhi unke changul main fas jate hai
 However, these ideas are hollow and immaterial until they contain a communist vision
 marks ke anusaar shoshankari varg-sambandhon kii samaapti ke bina sthapit nahin kii ja sakati
 For this, he conceptualizes the first socialist phase, which will be based on giving each one according to his labor
 doosraa charan samyavaadee hoga jisamen har ek se uski kshamta ke anusaar or har ek ko uski kshamta ke anusaar dene kaa aadhaar grahan kiya jayega
 Investigating the American democratic revolution, talk of talk equality is a major trend in modern history
 america udhaaharan ke zariye ve samajhnaa chaahate the ki pashchimi samaaj ne samantvaad se loktantr kii taraf kis tarah sankraman kiya he
 They find the answer to the question why is the triumph of equality inevitable in the process? Why will social equality continue to develop? Talkweel says that the feudal system goes on to form a long chain from farmer to king
 par loktantr use tod kar shrunkhlaa kii har kadi ko mukt kar detaa he
 The desire to get out of the clutches of slavery and dependency increases the interest of the people in the idea of equality and thus creates the possibility of a democratic life
 tokvil ke anusaar loktantron main vyakti samanta ko azaadi ke upar bhi praathamikta dete hue uske jhande ko dridhtaa se thame rakhata he
 After these conclusions of the idea of equality, it is necessary to consider the question, what is the difference between equality and equality
 pariksha main baithne vaale har chaatr ko samaan ank nahin diye ja sakate
 Irrespective of family size, each one cannot be allotted same house
 pratibha or kshamta ko darkinar karte hue har vyakti kii aamadani samaan nahin kii ja sakati
 Therefore the appropriate criterion of equality should be something more than symmetry
 lekin, duusari taraf samarupata kaa mahatva nyaaypurna prakriyaaon ke liye ubharta he
 Procedures for bringing equality can be justified only when they are equal for all, such as equality of opportunities, equality of all in the eyes of law, etc
 samanta kii paribhaasha karnaa jaraa kathin he
 It is much more priceless than the idol
 zyaadaatar log ise achetan rup se un bhaavon se jodate hai jo ‘vahi’, ‘ek-jaisaa’, ‘nyyochit’ aadi shabdon se sampreshit hote hai

 Laski says, 'in the whole field of political science, no idea is more difficult than' equality '
 ’ Rousseau distinguished between natural and traditional inequalities
 prakruti-pradutt asamantaayein paaramparik asamantaayein hai
 Socialists and Marxists say that traditional inequalities, especially traditional economic inequalities, have so much power that they cover all natural inequalities
 marks kehete hai: The most influential positive thinker Laski described the following conditions as essential for equality: haal main bryan varnan ne samanta kii ek vyapak avadharana prastut karte hue sujhaayaa he ki samanta main nimnlikhit ghatak avadharanaon kaa samavesh hona chahieh Legal equality means equality before the law and equal protection of the law for all
 avadharana yah he ki sabhi manushya janm se samaan hote hai, isliye kanoon ke saamne samaan haisiyat ke paatr hai
 The law is blind and therefore no one will deal with the person he is dealing with
 vah budhimaan ho yaa murkh, tejasvi ko yaa budhu, nata ho yaa kaddavar, garib ho yaa amir, uske saath kanoon vaisaa hi vyavhaar karegaa jaisaa auron ke saath karegaa
 But there are also remedies
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi balak yaa balika ke saath kisi vayask purush yaa stri jaisaa vyavhaar nahin kiya jayega or balak yaa balika ke saath murauvat kiya jayega
 Political independence basically means universal suffrage and representative government
 saarvajaneen matadhikaar kaa matlab yah he ki sabhi vayaskon ko mat dene kaa adhikaar he or ek vyakti kaa ek hi mat hota he
 Representative government means that everyone has the right to compete in elections without discrimination and stands for election to public service
 lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki sabhi ko mat dene ke liye vivash kiya ja saktaa he or prayek ko apni pasand jaahir kerani he yaa yadi kuch logon ko galat prabhaav daalkar matdaan karne se vimukh kar diya jaataa he yaa chaahe jise mat dene ke liye raji kar liya jaataa he to uske sambandh main rajya kuch khaas nahin kar saktaa or agar zyaadaatar log yaa kaaphi badi sankhya main log matdaan nahin karte or is prakaar sarkaar ke pratinidhik swaroop ko kamjor karte hai to raajnneetik samanta kii shuddh udaaravaadi samaj ke anusaar kisi prakaar kii raajnneetik asamanta kaa aarope bhi nahin lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Merely technical or constitutionally guaranteed political equality also does not mean true political equality, as money power plays a major role in major liberal democracies
 jin logon, samoohon yaa virgon ke paas yah takat hoti he ve agar iskaa istemaal karne ko tatpar rahete hai to unhen apane raajnneetik hiton ko aage badhaane main isse itani zyada madad milti he ki uski kaat karnaa kathin hota he
 Thus the power of money alone usually plays a very important role in controlling the results of elections
 keval ummidavaaron or partiyon dwaara kharch kiya gaya paisa hi nahin balki paise ke sambandh kaa puraa tantra isamen madadgaar hota he
 Publicity media play a huge role in today's liberal democracies, and especially in such democracies that have a large middle class, and although these mediums are considered independent, they cannot in fact be independent, because they For financial survival and prosperity, companies mainly rely on advertisements and for them the business world It is important to be sensitive to political sensibilities and interests and the agenda of companies
 jis had tak prachaar madhyam logon ko prabhavit karte hai us had tak ye kaary-suchiyaan un tak sampreshit ho jaati hai, chaahe yah kaam ve kisi sochi-samajhi yojana ke adheen karte hon yaa yon hi, yaa iske peeche unki majaburi ho yaa na ho
 Thus, the end result of this dissolves the level of level of political equality that would otherwise be practiced
 upar kahi gai baton ke alaava bharat jaise loktantr main shaktishaalee kaaryakari naukarshahiyaan or nyaayik sevaaon ke sadsy hote hai, jinhen raajnneetigyon kii tarah janata nahin chunati or agar log unase tang aa chuke hai to unka koi chunaav nahin hota ki ve unhen nikaal baahar karen
 Due to their educational and family background, members of these groups often come from the upper economic classes and classes and continue to influence policy making relentlessly and strongly
 jaahir he ki ye samooh anyon kii apeksha adhik raajnneetik samanta kaa upbhog karte hai
 For example, when a judge of the Supreme Court prohibits any policy legislation of the government and declares it unlawful, although the composition of that legislation is made by the elected representatives in free and fair elections, whether as illiterate as they are or To be educationally qualified, that is
 vah nyaayadhish kanoonee taur par to nahin lekin vishuddh raajnneetik drushtikon he spashtatah apane anya sah-nagarikon kii apeksha adhik shreshth samanta kii sthiti kaa upbhog kar rahaa hota he
 The notion of economic and social equality means different things to different people
 aarthik samanta se praarambhik udaarvaadiyon kaa taatpary keval yah tha ki har vyakti ko, uski paariwarik yaa aarthik sthiti chaahe jo ho, apana dhandha or pesha chunane kaa adhikaar he or prayek vyakti ko anubandh karne kii swatantraaa he, taaki jahaan tak anubandhatmak dayitvon kaa sambandh he, desh ke har vyakti ke saath samaan vyavhaar ho sake
 Gradually, the situation started to change in the direction of the notion that everyone should have equal opportunity to live as a full human being
 dhire-dhire yah samajha or sweekaar kiya jane laga ki samanta kaa matlab yah hona chahie ki samaaj main koi bhi itnaa garib na ho ki uske paas buniyadi aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke saadhan na hon or maansik tathaa shaareerik vikaas ke liye use praathmik avasar sulabh na hon
 In Rousseau's words, "by equality we should not mean that every person should have equal power and wealth, but it should mean that no citizen should be rich enough to buy others and someone Even a citizen should not be so poor that he is forced to sell
 ’ H

 Laski refined the positive liberal conception of economic equality and the meaning of equality made available everything without which life is meaningless
 unhone kaha ki buniyadi aavashyaktaa kii vastuen to pariman or kism ke kisi bhed ke bina sabhi ke liye sulabh honi chahie
 All humans must have the necessary food and shelter
 unhone buniyadi aavashyaktaaon kii purti ko avasar kii samanta kii purv-shart mana or us aarthik samanta ke liye aarthik asamanta kii ati ko kam karne kii himaayat kii The Marxist view of equality deals with equality, especially economic equality, with property and class exploitation
 sach to yah he ki ruso or kence jaise gaiyr-marxvaadi udaaravaadi chintakon ne bhi samanta or sampatti ke bich ke sambandh kaa nirdesh kiya he
 For example, Kense states: 'it is not easy for societies such as nomads and hunting tribes that have no use of private property to be egalitarian but societies that allow individuals to collect private property are not easy for them
 Happen
 ’ marxvaadi vishleshan main samanta keval virgon yaa varg-vibhajit samaaj ko mitaa kar hi praapt kii ja sakati he or uski purna prapti nijee sampatti ke unmoolan se hi sambhav he
 The Marxist idea is to establish a society in which there will be no private property or economic classes and each will be given what he has to pay according to the principle of 'work according to the qualifications and price as per requirement'
 vitaran kaa kaam rajya kaa he
 Lenin and other Marxists attack the positive liberal notion that economic inequalities can be eradicated by state intervention and that access to the basic necessities of life can be ensured for all, as they believe if private property If not eradicated, exploitation and inequalities will return slowly due to the power of money from the upper classes
 saamaajik samanta kaa matlab he rang, ling, jati, langik pravriti aadi ke aadhaar par bhed -bhav kii anupasthiti, samanta ke kanoonee, raajnneetik or aarthik pahaluon se bhinn, varshon se yah mahasoos kiya jaataa rahaa he ki baaki ke jo bhed-bhav kuch samaajon main hajaaron saal se vidyaman rahe hai unhen raajnneetik or kanoonee adhikaron aarthik vikaas or aarthik asamantaaon ke unmoolan kii teevr pragati ke bal par bhi kamjor karnaa kathin he
 Women obtained the franchise in England in the 1920s
 dakshin africa or sanyukt rajya america ke kuch hisson main chand dashak pehle tak kaalon ko apane hi desh main bahut saare kshetron se alag rakhaa jaataa tha
 Scavengers in many countries are forced to live in isolated dirty places away from society, which is neither political nor economic but a social mindset
 aaj bhi bharat main aise gaanv hai jahaan nichali jatiyon ke logon ke saath upree jati ke log jaanwaron jaisaa vyavhaar karte hai or yadi unamem se koi apni sujh-boojh se dhanwaan yaa shaktishaalee ban jaataa he to bhi uske saath uski jati ke anya logon se bhinn vyavhaar nahin kiya jaataa he
 On the other hand, neo-liberal thinking - especially Milton Friedman and F
A
 The neo-liberal thought propounded by Heck - a very different rant about equality
 vah maanata he ki samanta or swatantraaa multah ek-duusare ke viruddh hai or isliye swatantraaa ke haq main asamanta ko sahan karnaa chahie or aaj duniya bhar main niti-nirdhaaran main - khaastaur se antarrashtriya mudra kosh or vishwa bank ke niti-nirdhaaran main is vichaar kaa jabardast bolbalaa he
 Neo-liberals also believe that tolerating inequality will ultimately prove to be of maximum benefit to the entire economy, as a result of which private economic activity will increase

 It is a symbol of a great woman Savitri's loyalty to God and the great power of husbandry religion
 This fast symbolizes the victory of Savitri over Yamraj
 She carries it
 This fast occurs on the new moon of Jyeshtha month
 In some places it is also celebrated on the full moon day of Jyeshtha month
 It is said that Goddess Savitri got her husband's life back from Yamraj under the Vat tree, since then the worship of the Vat tree started from this day
 If we consider, we get the message of the utility and protection of trees by worshiping the vat
 In Hindu culture, trees are considered like living gods
 In the Matsya Purana, it has been said about the trees that the virtue found on the construction of ten wells is equal to the construction of a pond, The virtue of getting ten lakes is equal to building a lake and the virtue of building ten lakes is equal to that of one virtuous son and the virtue of ten virtuous sons is just by planting a tree
 Trees are nature's boon which gives us life and better health along with greenery and fruit flowers
 It is said that a banyan tree on earth has the powers of all the three deities
 Wave tree is also known for its vastness
 Logically, this tree has been protecting people from the scorching heat of Jyeshtha month
 That is why the tradition of worshiping it became the first month of Jyeshtha month
 Vat tree is also known for its vastness
 Logically speaking, this tree has been protecting people from the scorching heat of Jyeshtha month
 That is why its tradition of worshiping became the first month of Jyeshtha month
 Vat tree is also known for its vastness
 Logically speaking, this tree has been protecting people from the scorching heat of Jyeshtha month

 In the third century AD, this fertile area decreased slightly due to the spread of the desert here
 yarakanda main adhiktar uigur log basate hai
 Cotton, wheat, maize, pomegranate, khubani, akhrot and pear are grown here
 is zile ke unche ilaaqon main yaks or bhed paale jate hai
 There are many valuable minerals under the earth, such as petrol, natural gas, gold, copper, lead and coal
 yarakanda shinjiyang praant ke mahatvapurn or aitihaasik kashgar or khotaan shaharon ke bich sthit he
 Once upon a time traders from Kashmir used to come to Ladakh and Karakoram Pass with goods
 aadhunik yug main china kaa shinjiyang-tibet rajmarg yahan se shuru hokar, aksai chin ke raste se hokar tibet ke lhatse shahar tak jaataa he
 From here, another historic route leads southwest, passing through the city of Tashkurgan, entering the Afghan Walkan Corridor and then passing through the Brogil Pass to the Badakhshan region of Afghanistan
 yarakanda kaa mausam shushk he or kul milakar har varsh sirf 53 millimetre kii barf-barish padati he
 The average temperature in January is −5
5 ° c and 25

 a transformer or transformer is an electrical machine with no moving or rotating components
 vidyut upkarnon main sambhavtah transafarmar sarvaadhik vyapak rup se prayukt vidyut sashitr he
 It transfers electrical energy from one electric circuit to another circuit by means of conductors connected by electric induction
 transfarmar keval prayavarti dhara yaa vibhavaantar ke saath kaary kar saktaa he, ekadish ke saath nahin
 Transformers can be one-phase, three-phase or multi-phase
 yah sabhi vidyut mashiinon main sarvaadhik daksh mashin he
 In the modern era, the transformer has become an integral part of the electrical and electronic industries
 kisi transafarmar main ek, do yaa adhik vinding ho sakati hai
 The number of primary and secondary winding turns of two winding transformers and their potentials has the following relation: is sutara se spasht he ki primary voltata ke diye hue maan ke liye primary evam secondari vinding ke pheron kii sankhya kaa uchit chayan karke ham dwitiyak vinding main icchit vibhavaantar praapt kar sakate hai
 When the voltage of the secondary winding is greater than the voltage of the primary winding, such transformer is called the high transformer
 iske vipareet jab dwitiyak vinding kaa vibhavaantar praathmik vinding ke vibhavaantar se kam hota he to aise parinamitra ko apchaayi parinamitra kehete hai
 The main use of transformer is to convert electric power to high voltage or low voltage
 aisa karne se vidyut urja ke upyog main suvidha or dakshata aati he
