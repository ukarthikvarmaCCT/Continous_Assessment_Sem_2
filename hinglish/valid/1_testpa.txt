 Tattvamasi is one of the four Mahavakyas described in the ancient Hindu scriptures and Upanishads of India, which literally means "he is you"
 xxrep 5 ★ mahavakya he tatvamasi xxrep 5 ★ Tattvamasi means that you are the one
 vah dur nahin he, bahut paas he, paas se bhi zyada paas he
 He is yours
 yah mahavakya he
 The meaning of Mahavakya means that if you hold this one sentence and do some research, then the ultimate state of life becomes available
 isliye isko mahavakya kehete hai
 Then there is no need for any scripture, and there is no need for any Vedas and any Quran and Bible
 tatvamasi paryaapt veda he
 If one recites this one sentence properly, contemplate it, does nididhyasana, does samadhi, then there is no need for any other scripture
 mahavakya kaa arth he: punjeebhoot, jisamen sab aa gaya ho
 This Mahavakya is a formula for spiritual chemistry
 isamen teen baaten kahi hai tat, vah, tvam, tu; donon ek hai — teen baaten hai
 He and you are one, that's all
 lekin sara vedant, sara anubhav rishiyon kaa, in teen main aa jaataa he
 The formulas like this are mathematics - existence, God and you are the inner consciousness, they are not two, they are one
 itnaa hi saar he samast vedon kaa, phir baaki sab failaav he
 Therefore such a sentence is called Mahavakya in the Upanishads
 is tarah ke vaakya purna maun main sune jane chahie
 Therefore, for thousands of years, the sages in India insisted that the supreme pride should not be written
 unka aagrah bada keemtee tha
 But it was impossible to complete
 likhnaa padaa
 For thousands of years, it was insisted that the supreme knowledge should not be written
 bahut log, visheshkar bhashashasthri, linguist sochate hai ki chunki lipi nahin thi, likhane kaa upaay nahin tha, isliye bahut din tak veda or upanishad nahin likhe gaye
 They think wrong
 kyonki jo tatvamasi jaisaa anubhav uplabdh kar sakate the, jo is mahavakya ko anubhav main laa sakate the, ve likhane kii kala na khoj lete, yah asambhav maaloom padataa he
 There was an art of writing, but he was not ready to write
 kyon? kyonki aise mahavakya likh die jaaen, to har koi har kisi haalat main pard letaa he
 And after reading this we get into the illusion that they understood
 ye vaakya kisi vishesh gun, kisi vishesh avasthaa, chitt kii koi vishesh paristhiti main hi sunne yogya hai
 That's when they enter the life
 har kabhi sun lene par khatra he
 There are two dangers, one will be missed, and i will know, and the second danger is that because of this information you rarely prepare to create the mood in which it should have been heard

 We consider the following function sabase pehle ham is falan kaa pratham avkalaj nikaalte hai or usko shunya ke baraabar rakhkar sambhavit ucchisht / nimnisht kaa pataa lagaate hai
 To make sure that x = 0 is superimposed on / low, we assume the second derivative of this function at x = 0 and see if the second derivative is positive or negative at both points
 nimnlikhit falan ko lete hai- Let's find the first derivative of: falan kaa dwitiya avkalaj yah he: Keeping the first derivative zero, the value of x gives the following: x 1 = 1 2 { \ displaystyle x_{1}={ \ sqrt { \ frac {1}{2 xxrep 4 } par falan ke dwitiya avkalaj kaa maan rinatmak he, atah x=x_1 par is falan kaa ucchisht he
 Similarly we see that the value of the second derivative of the function at x 2 = - 1 2 { \ displaystyle x_ {2} = - { \ sqrt { \ frac {1} {2 xxrep 4 } is positive, so the function at x_2 The following is nimnlikhit falan par vichaar karen jiskaa graph saamne diya gaya he- First of all, we find the first derivative of this function and keep it equal to zero and find the possible high / low
 is baat ko sunishchit karne ke liye ki x = 0 par ucchisht / nimnisht he, ham is x=0 par is falan ke dwitiya avkalaj kaa maan nikaalte hai or dekhte hai ki yah dhanatmak he yaa rinatmak
 Therefore, we conclude that this function has neither high nor low

 a synchronous motor or synchronous motor is an alternating current-driven electric motor
 iskaa naam tulyakalika motor yaa sincronas motor is kaaran he kyonki iske roter kii ghurnan gati thik-thik utani hi hoti he jitani stater main nirmit ghurni chumbakeey kshetra kii gati hoti he
 This motor is often not used to rotate a load, but is used to improve the power coefficient
 vishesh sthitiyon main iskaa upyog lod chalaane main bhi kiya jaataa he
 Synchronous speed, jahaan: The main parts of a synchronous motor are the stator and rotor
 isaki stater bhi preran motor ke samaan hi hoti he jis par teen-feji vinding kii gayi hoti he
 The magnetic field is generated either by a permanent magnet on the rotor or by giving DC to the electromagnets built on the rotor
 baahar se is disi ko roter par laane ke liye slip ring kaa prayog karnaa padataa he
 In large motors, a DC generator is placed on the same shaft
 isse praapt disi ko roter par bane vidyutchumbakon ko diya jaataa he
 Depending on the design, the rotor is of two types - tulykaalik motor ko 'over-iksite' karke chalaane par iske dwaara lee gayi dhara iske voltage se agragami hoti he
 On this basis, it can be used to increase the power coefficient
 isaki sabase acchhee baat yah he ki yadi lod kaa shakti-gunank parivartit ho rahaa ho to is motor kii field-viding kii dhara ko parivartit karke iske dwaara lee jane vaali dhara kaa shakti-gunank bhi is prakaar parivartit kiya ja saktaa he ki lod tathaa yah tulykaalik motor kaa sammilit shakti-gunank 1 ho jaay

 Catholicism or Roman Catholicism is a main branch of Christianity whose followers consider the Pope located in the Vatican city of Rome as their bishop
 isai dharm kii duusari mukhya shakha protestant kehalaati he or uske anuyaayi pope ke dharmik netritv ko nahin sweekaarte
 There are even greater differences in religious beliefs between Catholics and Protestants
 roman katholic carch isa ne apane bhavi anuyaayiyon kii shiksha diksha ke liye ek carch kii sthapana kii thi or sant peter ko iskaa adhyaksh niyat kiya tha
 Saint Peter died in Rome, from which the Bishop of Rome began to be considered the head of the Church

 The first oriental churches separated from Rome
 baad main protestant dharm kaa udai hua jiske falswaroop paashchaatya carch ke ek mahatvapurn ansh ne rome ke bishap kaa adhikaar asweekaar kar diya
 Notwithstanding all this, today, more than half of Christians around the world are members of the Roman Catholic Church
 yah carch roman kaha jaataa he kyonki rome ke vatican nagar se iskaa sanchaalan hota he
 The original meaning of Kathlik is broad
 katholic carch kaa daawa he ki vah yugaugantar tak arthath 'sab samay' 'sabhi deshon' ke manushyon ke liye khulaa rahata he or isa dwaara prakat kii gai 'sabhi' dharmik sachchaaiyaan sikhalaataa he

 Catholicism is called "catholicism" in English
 isamen 'ji' ke uccharan or isapar lagi 'o' kii maatra ke uccharan par dhyaan den
 Organized Catholicism is also called "catholic Church" in English
 yah gaur-talab baat he ki yadhyapi "carch" shabd kaa arth "girizaa" hota he, "catholic carch" kaa arth "sampoorn catholic dharmik samudaay" bhi hota he
 Catholics believe that their religious organization continues the custom of the early Christian organization and is its sole heir
 ve maanate hai ki unki prarthana ritiyon main jo roti or madiraa kaa paan kiya jaataa he vah dharmik arth main isa messiah kaa maas or rakt ban jate hai jinhen prarthana karne vaale grahan karte hai
 This is not the case with Protestants
 catholic pope ko isai dharm kaa prithvi par param adhyaksh maanate hai jo ki protestant nahin maanate
 In this religious organization, there is one clergyman above each clergyman and finally the pope is above all others
 catholic mat main padariyon ko vivaah karne kii anumati nahin he or unhen aaajeevan brahmacharya kaa paalan karnaa hota he

 kha devanagari varnmaala kaa ek vyanjan he

 In all languages, it is pronounced as kh, or

 Walnut = Akhot "nonsense" In this example, b removes the underlying schwa for correct pronunciation

 "kha" ke vibhinn roopon ke prakaar hai: Mood stability is a form of psychotherapy that is used to treat mood disorders, which is characterized by acute and sustained mood changes, especially bipolar disorder
 manodasha sthirikari daawa kaa prayog manodasha dwidhruvi vikaar ke ilaaj, avsaad or unmaad ko dabaane ke liye kiya he
 Mood stabilizing drugs are also used in borderline personality disorders and schizoaffective disorders
 "manodasha sthirataa" ek prabhaav kaa varnan he, ek tantra nahin he
 These agents are classified by more precise terminology
 manodasha sthirataa dawaaen saamaanya rup main vargeekrut kiye jaati hai : Several "mood stability" agents are also classified as anticonvulsants
 kabhi kabhi yah shabd "antikanvalgent manodasha sthirikari" kaa varnan ek varg ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 While this group is defined as an effect rather than a mechanism, there is at least a preliminary understanding of the mechanisms of anticonvulsants in the treatment of mood disorders
 gabapaintin dwidhruvi vikaar ke upachaar ke liye epad dwaara anumodith nahin he
 Randomized controlled trials do not describe gabapentin as an effective treatment, but because of its positive but low quality literature review, many psychiatrists prescribe it
 topiramait bhi dwidhruvi vikaar ke liye epad dwaara anumodith nahin he or ek 2006 cocran samiksha dwaara yah nishkarsh nikaala he ki dwidhruvi beemaari ke kisi bhi charan main topiramait ke upyog kii sifarish aparyaapt saboot par aadhaarit he
 Sometimes an antidote in combination with mood stabilization claims, such as lithium, can be used
 sabase manodasha sthirikari agent vishuddh antimenic hai, jo ki unmaad ke upachaar or mood badalane main prabhavi he, lekin avsaad ke upachaar main prabhavi nahin hai
 The principal exceptions to that rule are lamotrigine and lithium carbonate because they are the treatment of both manic and depressive symptoms
 jabaki antimenic agent jaise ki valproic acid yaa carbomazepin avsaad kaa upachaar nahin kar sakate lekin purv do kar sakate hai, dwidhruvi marijon ko unmaad se dur rakhane se or unke manodasha ke parivartan ko rokane se unhen avsaad se dur rakhane main madad mil hai
 Yet during depressive disorder an antidepressant is often prescribed in addition to the claim to achieve depressive mood stability
 pratiyashapak jab khaskar akele liya jaye yaa kabhi kabhi jab manodasha sthirataa praapt karne kii daawa ke saath liya jaataa he tab yah kuch jokhim jaise ki unmaad, maansik or dwidhruvi rogiyon main anya samasyaayein laata he
 The antidepressant utility in the treatment of depression phase bipolar disorder is not clear
 sabase manodasha sthirikari dawa pratiakshepak he, jiske mahatvapurn apwaad main sabase acha or sabase purana lithium he

 paanchavin putali leelavati ne bhi raja bhoj ko vikramaditya ke bare main jo kuch sunaaya usase unki daanveerta hi jhalkati thi
 The story was as follows- hameshaa kii tarah ek din vikramaditya apane darbar main rajkaaj nibata rahe the tabhi ek brahman darbar main aakar unase mila
 He told them that the people of his kingdom would be happy and their fame would spread all around, if they build a palace for themselves in Libra ascendant
 vikram ko uski baat janch gai or unhone ek bade hi bhavy mahal kaa nirmaan karavaaya
 The artisans decorated him completely with gold-silver, diamond-jewels and gem-beads on the instructions of the king
 mahal jab banakar taiyaar hua to uski bhavyata dekhte banati thi
 Vikram along with his relatives and servants went to see him
 unke saath vah brahman bhi tha
 Even the spells that Vikram was enchanted, the Brahmin also kept on opening his mouth
 bina soche uske munh se niklaa-"kaash, is mahal kaa maalik main hota!" vikramaditya ne uski ichha jaanate hi jhat vah bhavy mahal use daan main de diya
 As if the Brahmin's feet were not falling on the ground
 vah bhaagta hua apni patni ko yah samachar sunaane pahunchaa
 Here, the Brahmin saw him coming empty-handed, before he said something, he told him to get the palace studded with diamonds and jewels and jewels
 brahman kii patni kii to khushi kii seemaa na rahi
 She once felt as if her husband had gone mad and was just talking about it, but on her repeated requests, she agreed to walk with him to see the palace
 mahal kii shobhaa dekhakar uski aankhe khuli rah gayi
 They did not know when it was evening when they saw the corner of the fragrance
 thake-maande ve ek shayan-kaksh main jaakar nidhaal ho gaye
 His eyes opened with a voice at midnight
 saare mahal main khushboo faili thi or sara mahak prakaash maan tha
 When he listened carefully, Lakshmi was speaking
 vah kah rahi thi ki unke bhagya se vah yahan ai he or unki koi bhi ichha puri karne ko taiyaar he
 The Brahmin couple was in a bad condition due to fear
 brahmani to behosh hi ho gai
 Lakshmi repeated her statement three times
 lekin brahman ne kuch nahin maanga to cruddh hokar chali gai
 As soon as he left, both the light and the fragrance disappeared
 kaaphi der baad brahmani ko hosh aayaa to usne kaha- "yah mahal zaroor bhutaha he, isliye daan main mila
 Better than this, we have a broken house where we can sleep peacefully
 " brahman ko patni kii baat janch gai
 Shortly after spending the rest of the night, he collected his belongings and returned to the old hut
 brahman apane ghar se sidhaa rajbhavan aayaa or vikramaditya se anurodh karne laga ki ve apana mahal waapas le len
 But how could they accept the donated item
 kaaphi sochane ke baad unhone mahal kaa uchit mulya lagaakar use kareed liya
 The Brahmin happily returned to his home
 brahman se mahal kharidne ke baad raja vikramaditya usamen aakar rahane lage
 Now there was also a court

 When Lakshmi asked him to ask for anything, he said- "by your grace i have everything

 Collaboration means two or more individuals or institutions working together
 sahyog kii prakriya main gyaan kaa barambar tathaa sabhi dishaao main aadan-pradaan hota he
 It is a work of intellect taken towards the attainment of a common goal
 yah jaruri nahin he ki sahyog ke liye netritv kii aavashyak hota he
 But it is not necessary that leadership is also not supported
 sahyog ek dusre ke madhyam se hota he
 Nevertheless, it is very important to have mutual support
 ek dusre ko aage badhaana chahie
 This does not mean that the possibility of mutual cooperation is very high with the cooperation of any organization
 phir bhi paaramparik yaa aarthik sahyog kaa hona bahut myne rakhata he
 The spirit of cooperation should be there in every human being
 or main dusro ke sahyog kar sakun
 With the help of each other, it continues to grow in the life of a country or a human being
 sahyog bhi kai prakaar ke hote hai
 Whether it is economic or technical cooperation, it can be more
 parantu sahyog ek vishisht kaary ke rup main hota he
 Even then, cooperation can be exchanged at home or outside
 parantu yah aavashyak nahin he ki rupaya se hi sahyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Man's cooperation in life is not a duty but it is important to have cooperation in the life style of man
 sahyog kii koi seemaa nirdhaarit nahin hota he jo kabhi bhi kisi vyakti kaa sahyog kiskaa mil sake
 Even then, like a common man, he should cooperate in life
 kisi sanstha ho yaa dharm sthaan ko aap sahyog kar sakate hai
 Whether it is a Hindu religious place or a Muslim religion, you can cooperate in any place or institution or society
 kisi bhi desh ke netaa dusre desh jate hai to vah ek dusre ko aapasi sahyog kii bhaavana banaata he
 And the two countries are seen cooperating
 tab par bhi donon desh ke bich aapasi sahyog kaa hona jaruri hota he
 You can give cooperation in any area
 aarthik ho yaa takneekee evam anya kshetron main aap sahyog kar sakate hai
 Cooperation means can be of any kind
 vikaas ho yaa urja yaa parmaanu or takanic aadi main sahyog ho saktaa he
 And you agree to cooperate with any country in any field
 kyonki sahyog kaa arth hota he
 As long as no country cooperates with each other
 tab tak aage nahin batch saktaa he
 And any country wants cooperation with any country
 tabhi bhi vikaas ho saktaa he
 Whether a leader or an ordinary person, any person wants cooperation
 or bharat ki baat he
 So it is an important thing for India that cooperation should be made for any country
 jivan main kisi se bhi sahyog ho saktaa he
 But it is not necessary to say
 kab kiskaa sahyog kab mil jaayegaa
 Because no one knows who will get whose support
 or har aadmi chaahate hai ki mujhase jitna ho sake sahyog main karne ke liye taiyaar rahata hun
 Cooperation should be the spirit of every man
 ki main sahyog kar sakun
 Because what have you brought in life? yahi aadmi kaa ek mauka miltaa he ki main dusre kaa sahyog kar sakun
 You can support someone, whether yours or a stranger
 isamen kisi pe sahyog karne ke liye dabaab nahin banaaya jaataa he
 Because cooperation is not the pressure of pressure har aadmi ko koi na koi sahyog karata he
 Whether you are a wife or a villager, you definitely cooperate
 yah jaruri nahin he ki aap kaa sahyog gaanv kaa hi log kar sakate hai
 Can be a man from elsewhere
 sahyog hi ek aise shakti pradaan karata he
 Which leads man to the goal
 har aadmi main sahyog kii bhaabana hona chahie
 Man is such a creature
 jo har kisi ko sahyog kar saktaa he
 Because someone gets success with cooperation
 to use hamen sahyog karnaa chahie
 Any kind of cooperation you want to do
 to aap kar sakate hai
 No one is pressured to cooperate
 jo apni shradha ke anusaar aap de sakate hai
 But for any institution, the criteria of your cooperation depends on you
 or main usamen kis tarah kaa bhaagidaari ban sake
 Everyone should have a feeling of cooperation
 kyonki sahyog ek aise baat nahin he
 Which can be done for others
 parantu jab tak kisi bhi sanstha ke rup main kaam karti he
 Every man should cooperate
 sahyog se aadmi kaa manoval badata he
 Work done at the right time is considered good
 sahyog ek dusre ke saath milakar kiya janaa chahie
 But one should work according to his direction
 aaj sahyog ke liye apana kaam karata he
 Cooperation takes place in every village or society
 chahen kisi bhi jati kaa ho saktaa he
 But everyone should cooperate
 or kisi bhi prakaar kaa aap ko sahyog karnaa chahie
 Cooperation is the greatest work for human beings
 jivan ke saare pahalu main hamesh sahyog kaa bahut hi mahatvapurn bhumika hoti he
 Man should cooperate with every harm
 sahyog ek aise kaam ke liye jo dusre ke liye aage aane kaa mauka mil jaataa he
 Cooperation is the only one who supports every country, village, society or any caste class
 aapane dekha hi hoga ki jis tarah kaa uttrakhand main badal fatne se kitne aadmi kaa maut hua he
 In the same way, people are cooperating to bring society forward
 sahyog ek vaise cheez he jo har prakaar se aap sahyog kar sakate hai
 The kind that has happened in Uttarakhand, if you do not cooperate in this, then in whom should you sing
 yah bahut bady nuksaan hua he
 For the country
 is liye sahyog karnaa chahie
 i support a lot for every caste and religion
 gaanv ho yaa shahar kahin par bhi aap kisi prakaar kaa sahyog kar sakate hai
 There is no restriction for cooperation
 kisi bhi desh kaa aadmi koi bhi desh main sahyog kar saktaa he
 In India, we cannot cooperate anywhere in the whole world
 or kisi bhi desh main koi aadmi sahyog karnaa chaahate hai
 So no one can stop that man from cooperating whether the government or the common man cannot do anything
 kisi bhi vyakti ko personal kaam main bandha nahin karnaa chahie
 Every person in the life of an individual takes care of one or the other
 or kisi bhi paristhiti main vah apana kaam karte rahete hai
 This is the reason
 jab logon kii apni bhaavana hoti he ki main dusro kii sahyog kar sakate hai
 So nobody should resist in this
 or jivan main har prakaar kaa kaam karnaa chahie
 Which is beneficial for humans
 vahi karnaa chahie

 'victory Letter' was written by Guru Govind Singh to the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb
 zafarnama, dasam granth kaa ek bhaag he or isaki bhashaa farsi he
 Two papers became world famous in India's glorious history
 pehla patr chhatrapati shivaji dwaara raja jaisingh ko likhaa gaya tathaa doosraa patr guru govind singh dwaara shaasha aurangzeb ko likhaa gaya, jise zafarnama arthath 'vijay patr' kehete hai
 Undoubtedly, this letter of Guru Govind Singh is a wonderful trinity of spirituality, diplomacy and valor

 After the sacrifice of his father Guru Tegh Bahadur and his four sons, after the Battle of Khidrana in 1706 AD, Guru Govind Singh sent a letter to Bhai Daya Singh to the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb
 un dinon aurangzeb dakshin bharat ke ahmednagar main apane jivan kii antim saansen gin rahaa tha
 Bhai Daya Singh reached Ahmadnagar after traveling a long route via Delhi, Agra
 guru govind singh ke is patr se aurangzeb ko uttar bharat, visheshkar punjab kii vaastavik sthiti kaa pataa chalaa
 He understood that he was confused by the misinformation of the Mughal Subedar of Punjab, as well as he felt the valor and prestige of Guru Govind Singh
 aurangzeb ne jabardaar or mohammad yaar manasabadaar ko ek shahi farmaan dekar dilli bheja, jisamen guru govind singh ko kisi bhi prakaar kaa ksht na dene tathaa sammanpurvak laane kaa aadesh tha
 But it was not known to Guru Gobind Singh for a long time whether Bhai Daya Singh succeeded in giving Zafarnama to Aurangzeb in Ahmednagar
 at: ve swayan hi ahmednagar kii ore chal pade
 In October, 1706, he left for South India
 unhone marwar ke maarg se dakshin jane kaa vichaar kiya
 Many kings of Rajasthan welcomed him on the way

 It also includes the account of Aurangzeb's severe defeat by Marathas and Rajputs
 saath hi guru govind singh ne aurangzeb ko yah chetavanee bhi di he ki unhone punjab main uski paraajay kii puri vyavastha kar lee he
 In order to clarify the intention described in Guru Govind Singh's Zafarnama, it would be appropriate to give some of his key positions here
 guru govind singh ne jafarnama kaa prarambh ishwar ke samaran se kiya he
 He has written about himself that 'I have swore to God, which is the inscription of swords, arrows, spears and daggers, and the horses of a galloping horse in the battlefield
 ' unhone aurangzeb ko sambodhit karte hue likhaa, 'uskaa naam lekar, jisane tumhen badshahath di or mujhe dharm kii raksha kii daulat di he, mujhe vah shakti di he ki main dharm kii raksha karun or sachai kaa jhanda ooncha ho
 In this letter, Guru Govind Singh described Aurangzeb as 'sly', 'farebi' and 'makkar'
 saath hi uski ibaadat ko 'dhong' kaha tathaa use apane pita tathaa bhaaiyon kaa hatyara bhi bataaya
 Guru Gobind Singh, while introducing his self-respect and heroism, wrote, "I will put such a fire under your feet that in Punjab it will not even get water to extinguish you and drink you
" v guru govind singh ne aurangzeb ko chunauti dete hue likhaa, 'main is yuddh ke maidan main akelaa aauungaa
 You bring two horsemen with you
 ' phir likhaa, vkya hua agar mere chaar bachche maare gayi, par kundali maare dansane vaala naag abhi baaki he
 ' guru govind singh ne aurangzeb ko itihaas se sikh lene kii salaah dete hue likhaa, 'sikandar or shershah kahaan hai? aaj taimur kahaan he, babar kahaan he, humayun kahaan he, akbar kahaan he?' unhone pun: aurangzeb ko lalkaarte hue likhaa, 'agar kamajoro par julm karata he, unhen sataata he, to kasam he ki ek din aare se chirva duungaa
 With this, Guru Gobind Singh, while clarifying his policy on war and peace, wrote, 'when all efforts have been made, the path of justice is blocked, then it is right to lift the sword and it is right to fight
 ' or ant ke pad main ishwar ke prati purna aasthaa vyakt karte hue unhone likhaa, 'shatru bhale hamase hajaar tarah se shatruta kare, par jinka vishwaas ishwar par he, unka koi bal bhi baankaa nahin kar saktaa
 ' vastut: guru govind singh kaa zafarnama keval ek patr nahin balki ek vir kaa kavy he, jo bhartiya janamanas kii bhaawanaaon kaa dyotak he
 Not many patriots have taken inspiration from this letter from past to present

 His letter is a call to war, not a treaty
 saath hi shanti, dharmaraksha, aasthaa tathaa aatmavishvaas kaa parichaayak he

 The flow of ocean water in a continuous and directed direction is called ocean current
 vastutah mahasagariya dharaaen, mahasaagaron ke andar bahane vaali ushn yaa sheethal nadiyaan hai
 It is often mistaken that water in the oceans remains constant, but in reality it does not happen
 mahaasaagar kaa jal nirantar ek niyamit gati se bahata rahata he or in dhaaraon ke vibhinn rup dekhne ko milte hai
 The major drainage stream and stream current are in the natural stream
 ek stream karant kii kuch simaaen hoti hai, jabaki apvahan dhara karant ke bahaav kii koi vishisht seemaa nahin hoti
 Deserts on Earth are created due to climate change
 ucch daab ke kshetra evam thandi mahasagariya jal dharaaen hi ve prakritik ghatnaayen hai, jinaki kriyaaon ke falswaroop saikadon varshon ke baad registan banate hai
 There are mainly three reasons for the formation of ocean currents - first, the amount of salt in the water changes from one place to another, so the density of ocean water also changes with the location
 dravyon kii prakritik pravriti jisamen ve adhik ghanatv vaale kshetra kii ore agrasar hote hai, ke kaaran dharaaen banati hai
 In the second reason, the rays of the sun do not fall on the surface of the water
 is kaaran jal ke taapmaana main asamanta aa jaati he
 This creates convection currents
 teesraa kaaran sagar kii sataha ke upar bahane vaali tej hawaaen hoti hai
 They also have the ability to produce waves in water
 ye tarangen prithvi kii parikrama se bhi banati hai
 This rotation causes clockwise currents in the northern part of the Earth
 is prakaar mukhya kaarnon main nimna aate hai: Many currents flow on the earth
 in sab main gulf stream sabase mahatvapurn hota he
 The water in this stream becomes blue and warm
 iskaa bahaav mexico kii khadi ke uttar se canada tak hota he
 This is the reason that London and Paris remain less cold while the coastal areas of Norway remain snow free throughout the year
 iske alaava, brazil karant, japan, uttar bumadhya rekha, uttar prashanth mahasagariya tarang aadi vishwa kii pramukh sagari dhaaraon main gine jate hai
 Ocean currents are essential for ocean life
 ye sagariya jeev-jantuon ke liye aahaar kaa mukhya strot hoti hai
 Hot water from ocean waves goes to areas with cold water
 iske vipareet sagariya tarangon kaa asar bhu-taapmaana par bhi padataa he
 Knowledge of surface ocean currents can help control expenditure on shipping to a large extent
 inke kaaran hi eendhan kii khapat par bada prabhaav padataa he, jo vyay or yatra samay main kaaphi kami laata he
 In the olden times, knowledge of ocean currents and wind direction was even more important
 iskaa ek acha udhaaharan agulhas dhara he, jisane kaaran portugali navikon va anveshakon ko kaafii samay tak bharat aane se roke rakhaa
 Even today shipping competitors around the world take advantage of ocean currents
 mahasagariya dharaaen sagariya jivan ke liye bhi mahatvapurn hoti hai
 An example of this is eel fish
 sagariya dhaaraon kaa gyaan sagariya karkat ke adhyayan main bhi sahaayak hota he
 The opposite is also true
 ye dharaaen vishvaparyant taapmaana nishchit karne main bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaati hai
 The currents that bring the warm waters of the northern Andamasagar to northwestern Europe do not allow ice to settle in the coastal areas
 is kaaran vahaan ke pattanon main jalpoton kii awajahi baadhit nahin hoti
 Recently scientists have discovered a powerful water flow in the Indian Ocean region of the Southern Ocean
 ye us tantrajaal kaa ek mahatvapurn bhaag he jo jalwaayu parivartanon ko prabhavit karata he
 The volume of this ocean flow is equal to the volume of water of about forty Amazon rivers
 yah sthaan australia kii rajdhani, perth se 4200 kilometre dakshin-pashchim main sthit he
 According to him, this water current at a depth of three kilometers from the surface of the ocean is an important path in the global trajectory of ocean currents that affect climate changes
 cloud commuting yaa megh sanganana vastav main internet-aadhaarit prakriya or computer aplikeshan kaa istemaal he
 Google Apps is an example of cloud computing that provides business applications online and can be accessed using a web browser
 internet par sarvaron main jaankariyaan sadaa sarvada ke liye bhandaarit rahati hai or ye upayokta ke desktop, notebook, gaming consol ityadi par aavashyaktaanusaar asthai rup se sangrahit rahati hai
 To put it in a slightly extended and simple way, till now the software programs which you had installed locally on your computer and laptop-notebook, will no longer be needed because all these software will now give you access to web services Will mix with you
 web hosting ke kshetra main bhi cloud kaa upyog kar naveenatam prakaar kii web hosting seva cloud hosting prastut kii gai he
 Not only this, through sequences like Google Gear, you will also find many such features offline
 cloud computing computing kii ek style he jisamen gatik rup se parimapya or aksar abhaasi sansadhano ko internet par ek seva ke rup main uplabdh karaayaa jaataa he
 There is no need for users to have knowledge of, expertise in, or control of the technical framework of the "cloud" that helps them
 is avadharana main aamtaur par nimnlikhit ke sangyojan shaamil kiye jate hai: Cloud computing services often make common commercial applications available online and from a web browser, while software and data are stored on the server
 internet ke liye shabd cloud kaa upyog ek roopak ke rup main kiya jaataa he, yah is baat par aadhaarit hota he ki computer network aarekh main internet kaa varnan kaise kiya jaataa he or yah isamen chhipe hue jatil buniyadi saranchana ke liye ek saransh he
 The first academic use of the term was Professor Ramnath K
 This was originally done by Chelappa who defined it as a computing paradigm where the boundaries of computing would be determined by economic logic rather than technical limitations
 cloud computing companiyon ke praudyogiki kharch main kami laata he, kyonki ise sambhddha aplikeshan sadsyta shulk chukaa kar online ke jariye kiraye par liya ja saktaa he
 Cloud computing technology plays an important role in saving time, reducing infrastructure costs, ease of data storage, application management expenses, etc
 cloud computing ke kiraaye kaa model bhi bahut suvidhajanak he
 Even it can be rented for a few hours
 atirikt sthaneey software emypi brouzar ke alaava aavashyak nahin he• upyogkartaaon ko sidhe, badal ke liye paper dastavejon hastantaran kar sakate hai bhautik bhandaaran kii laagat ko kam karne• sahaj yujar interphes kisi ko bhi is pranali kaa upyog karne ke liye Cloud computing can cause confusion with the following
 darasal, kai cloud computing kaa prabhavi istemaalaus of 2009 ke anusaar grids par nirbhar karata he, isaki swytt visheshtaayen hoti hai or bill jaisi upyogitaayen hoti hai-lekin cloud computing kii vistrut hone kii pravriti hoti he jo gridon or upyogitaaon ke dwaara pradaan kii jaati he
 Some successful cloud architectures have little or no centralized infrastructure or billing system, include peer networks such as bittorrent and Skype, or volunteer computing SETI @ home
 iske alaava, kai vishleshak grid praudyogiki or cloud computing ke bich vikasvaadi, vriddhishil maarg par jor dene main ruchi rakhte hai, isaki shuruyaat 1990 main anuprayog seva pradaata ke rup main or saas ke samanaantar hui, aksar ise cloud par anuprayog ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Some people believe that the real difference between these terms is marketing and branding; That is, the development of technology was incremental and the development of marketing was discrete
 cloud computing graahakon kii aam taur par apni bhautik buniyadi saranchana nahin hoti he jo software platform ke liye ek mejabaan kaa kaary kare
 Instead, they avoid spending capital by using rental from a third party provider
 ve ek seva ke rup main sansadhano kaa upbhog karte hai or keval unhi sansadhano ke liye bhugtan karte hai jinka ve upyog karte hai
 Many cloud-computing proposals operate based on the utility computing model, which corresponds to how traditional utility services are consumed, while others bill on a subscription basis
 kai kiraayedaaron ke bich "kharaab ho sakane vaali or amoort" computing kshamta upyogita kii dar main sudhaar kar sakati he, chunki sarvaron ko anaavashyak rup se niskriy nahin choda jaataa he 
 a side effect of this approach is that overall computer usage has increased dramatically, with customers not requiring engineering for peak load limits
 iske atirikt, "ucch gati ke bandwidth main vruddhi" anya citon par kendrikrut dhaanche se samaan pratikriya samay praapt karne ko sambhav banaati he
 Cloud computing users can avoid spending capital on hardware, software and services when they pay the provider only what they are using
 upbhog kaa bill ek upyogita yaa sadsyta ke aadhaar par banaaya jaataa he jisamen aparrant laagat bahut kam hoti he yaa nahin hoti he
 Other advantages of the sharing style approach at the moment are reduced barriers to entry, shared infrastructure and cost management, lower overhead and the achievement of a wider range of applications
 upyogkarta aamtaur par kisi bhi samay anubandh ko samaapt kar sakate hai or sevaao ko aksar vittiya dand ke saath seva str samjhaute ke dwaara cover kiya jaataa he
 According to Nicholas Carr, information technology has a strategic importance, with it being less expensive and standardized, and declining
 unhone tark diya ki cloud computing pratimaan shift 20 veen sadi ke prarambh main vidyut grid ke dwaara vidyut janitr ke visthaapan ke samaan hai
 Although companies may be able to save upfront capital expenditure, they may actually have to pay more for operating expenses and may not be able to save more
 aisi paristhitiyon main jab puunjigat vyay apekshaakrit kam hota he, yaa jahaan sanghathan ke paas parichaalan bajet kii tulana main apni puunji ke bajet ko lekar adhik lacheelaapan hota he, tab cloud model adhik vittiya arth nahin detaa he
 Other factors affecting the scale of any potential cost savings include the effectiveness of the company's data center compared to the cloud vendor, the company's current operating costs, the level of adoption of cloud computing, and the type of performance that the cloud hosts being done
 viemaware, san microsystems, recospes you es, ibiem, amejan, googlegugala, biemasi, microsoft or yahuu kuch pramukh cloud computing seva pradaata hai
 Cloud services are also being adopted by individual users through large enterprises, these enterprises include Wameware, General Electric and Procter & Gamble
 2009 main nae khiladi, jaise ubuntu cloud computing, kii or aakarshan bad rahaa he
 Most cloud computing infrastructure, as of 2009, includes trusted services, delivered through data centers and built at varying levels of virtualization technologies
 sevaayen kahin par bhi sulabh ho sakati hai, jo ki netwarking buniyadi saranchanaaon ko uplabdh karaata he
 Clouds often appear as the only point of accessibility for all computing needs of consumers
 aam taur par vanijyik avasaron se aksar ummid kii jaati he ki ve graahakon kii seva kii gunvattta aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karengi or praroopik rup se slas pesh karengi
 Open standards are complex for the growth of cloud computing and open source software has provided the foundation for many cloud computing edits
 di cloud telephoni se liya gaya ek shabd he
 By the 1990s, data circuits were tightly wired between destinations
 baad main, lambey samay se chali aa rahi telephone companiyon ne data sanchaar ke liye virtual privet network seva kii peshkash karnaa shuru kiya
 Telephone companies were able to offer vpn-based services as a fixed circuit at a low cost with the same guaranteed bandwidth
 kyonki ve upyogita ko santulit karne ke liye trephic ko badal sakati thim, is prakaar se unhone apane samgr network band vidth ko adhik prabhavi tareeke se kaam main liya
 As a result of this arrangement, it was impossible to determine in which way traffic would be diverted
 The term "telecom cloud" was used to describe this type of networking, and cloud computing is conceptually somewhat similar
 cloud computing virtual mashiinon par bahut adhik bharosa karti he, jo upyogkarta kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne ke liye maang par utpann hui hai
 Because these virtual instances are generated on demand, it is impossible to determine how many such vms will run in a given time
 chunki paristhiti kii maang ke anusaar vms ko kisi bhi die gaye computer par utpann kiya ja saktaa he, saath hi ve vishisht sthaan par sthit hote hai, yah sthiti cloud network se adhik milti he
 a common description in a network diagram is the depiction of a cloud
 cloud computing kii buniyadi avadharana 1960 main aayi, jab jon mecokerthi ne raay di ki "computeshan ko kisi din ek saarvajanik upyogita ke rup main sangathit kiy ja saktaa he"; vastav main sarvice beuro ke saath lakshanon kaa saajha karti he jo 1960 main aaye the
 The term cloud had already come into commercial use in the early 1990s, used to refer to asynchronous transfer mode networks
 durbhaagya purna tareeke se shuru hui general magic ne 1995 main kai doorsanchaar company sahyogiyon jaise AT&T, kii bhagidaari main ek kam aayu kaa cloud computing utpaada shuru kiya, ise upabhokta unmukh internet ke lokapriy hone se thik pehle shuru kiya gaya
 By the end of the 21st century, the term "cloud computing" began to appear more widely, although much of the attention at the time was limited to saas
 1999 main, Salesforce
com kii sthapana mark beniof, parkar haris or unke sahyogiyon ke dwaara kii gayi
 They Google and Yahoo! Many of the technologies developed by companies such as IT applied to commercial applications
 unhone apane vaastavik or safal graahakon ke saath saas or "maang par" kii avadharana bhi pradaan kii
 saas ke bare main mahatvapurn baat yah he ki ise simit takneekee sahaayta kii aavashyaktaa ke saath graahakon dwaara anukulit kiya ja saktaa he
 In the early 2000s, Microsoft expanded the concept of saas through the development of web services
 IBM ne 2001 main autonomik computing ghoshnaa patr main in avadharanaon kaa vivaran diya, jisane vishmangi bhandaaran, sarwar, anuprayog, network, suraksha tantra or aise anya tatwon ke saath jatil IT pranali ke prabandhan main unnat automation takneekon jaise swa-niyantran, swa-chikitsa, swa-vinyas or swa-anukulan kaa varnan kiya jinhen ek udhyam main abhaasikrut kiya ja saktaa he
 
 emazone ne nayi cloud saranchana ke parinaam swarup mahatvapurn aantarik prabhavita sudhaar paae jane or dot-kom babal ke baad apane data kendron ke aadhunikeekaran ke dwaara cloud computing ke vikaas main mahatvapurn bhumika nibhaai, iske liye usne ek utility computing aadhaar par 2005 main amejan web sevaao ke madhyam se apane system uplabdh karaaye
 In 2007, Google, IBM, and several universities began large-scale cloud computing research projects, becoming a well-known topic over time and after the term began
 2008 ke madhya tak, cloud computing ko mukhyadhara press main lokapriyata hasil hui or kai sambandhit ghatnayen huin
 In August 2008, Gartner's research observed that "organizations are moving from company-owned hardware and software assets to per-use service-based models" and found that "planned transfers towards cloud computing have resulted in some There will be a lot of growth in IT products in the regions and a lot of decrease in other areas
 " kyonki cloud computing upyogkarta ko apane data ke bhautik bhandaran kii anumati nahin detaa he yah data sangrahan or niyantran kii jimmedaari ko pradaata ke haathon main nahin detaa he
 Cloud computing is criticized for limiting the freedom of the user and making them dependent on the cloud computing provider and according to some critics to only use the same application or service stallmen ke prekshanon ke baad, intranet or pratibandhit citon ko uplabdh karana / unki mejabani karnaa unka rakrakhaav karnaa ek chunauti ban gaya
 The Cloud crosses many boundaries and "may be the ultimate form of globalization
" " phir bhi, yah jatil bhu rajanithik muddon ke liye ek vishay ban jaataa he or ek vishwa stareey bazaar ko sevaao kii delivery karne ke liye pradaata par asankhya viniamak vaataavaran ko santusht karne kaa dabaav ban jaataa he
 This happened in the early days of the Internet, when libertarian thinkers felt that "cyberspace is a distinct place created as its own legal institutions"
 kanoonee vaataavaran ko santulit karne ke prayaason ke baavjood, as of 2009 ke anusaar, pradaata jaise amejan web sevaao ne buniyadi saranchanaaon ko lagu kar ke or graahakon ko "uplabdhta kshetra" kaa chayan karne kii anumati dekar pramukh bazaar uplabdh karaaye
 Nevertheless, the issue of security and privacy in private through the government level remained a trademark
 company ne 2008 main jo "bhatte kaa notice" praapt kiya vah agast main radd ho gaya, jiske parinamswaroop ek saptaah se kam samay main hi trademark aavedan ko aupchaarik rup se asweekrut kar diya gaya
 In September 2008, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued a "notice of Allowance" to CG Active LLC for "cloud OS"
 jaisaa ki is notice ke tahat paribhaashit kiya gaya tha, ek cloud oparating system ek saamaanya oparating system he jo "computer ke andar or web par saftware ke bich sambandh prabandhan karata he," jaise Microsoft Azure 
 In November 2007, the Free Software Foundation issued the Afro General Public License, a version of gplv3 that ran alleged legal defense avenues related to free software design on a network, specifically saas
 Any change requires an application service provider which they do for Afro GPL open source code
 nigam yaa antim upyogkarta jo apane data kii uplabdhi nahin hone kii paristhiti se bachanaa chaahate hai- yaa yahan tak ki data ke kho jane kii paristhiti se bhi bachanaa chaahate hai- unhen praroopik rup se salaah di jaati he ki ve apni sevaao kaa upyog karne se pehle data suraksha par vikreta kii nitiyon kaa anusandhan karen

 In practice, data recovery capabilities can best be determined by experiments; For example, be asked to retrieve old data, note how long it takes, and confirm that the data received for testing matches the original data
 data suraksha ke nirdhaaran or adhik mushkil ho saktaa he, lekin ek drushtikon he aap data ko khud kutlekhith karen
 yadi aap ek bharosemand elgorithm kaa upyog karte hue data ko kutlekhith karen, to, seva pradaata kii suraksha or kutalekhan kii nitiyon par dhyaan na dete hue, data keval dicripshan kunjiyon ke saath sulabh ho jaayegaa
 This, however, gives rise to the problem of managing private keys in the drink-on-demand computing infrastructure
 ek upyogita computing ke aadhaar par mulya nirdhaaran upyog aadhaarit vikalp ke saath kiya jaataa he or kriyanvayan ke liye kam IT kushaltaaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Some people say that, the low cost of computing resources, the IT burden sometimes transfers the cost from in-house to outsource-provider
 iske alaava, laagat main kisi bhi kami ke laabh kaa upyog, sambandhit niyantran main kami, sulabhta or suraksha jokhimon ke liye kiya janaa chahie
 Since the infrastructure is off-site and accessible through the Internet, users can connect from anywhere
 phir bhi, kai pramukh cloud computing sevaaon ne kai samasyaon kaa saamana kiya he or IT or vyaper prabandhak aise samay par kam kar pate hai, jab ve prabhavit hote hai
 Security is often as good or as good as traditional systems, partly because providers are able to dedicate resources to address security issues many customers cannot afford
 Providers are generally logs accessible, but access to audit logs can be difficult or impossible
 "cloud" pradaata ke dwaara niyantrit data ke liye swaamitv, niyantran or sulabhta adhik kathin ho sakati he, thik vaise hi jaise kabhi kabhi vartmaan upyogitaaon ke saath "live" samarthan kii sulabhta praapt karnaa mushkil hota he
 Under the cloud paradigm, the management of sensitive data is placed in the hands of cloud providers and third parties
 ek cloud anuprayog cloud ko software saranchana main prayukt karata he, aksar graahak ke apane computer par anuprayog ko install karne or chalaane kii aavashyaktaa ko kam kar detaa he, is prakaar se software ke rakh rakhaav, chal rahi gatividhiyon or sahare ke boj ko kam karata he
 for example: ek cloud graahak ke paas computer hardware or / yaa computer software hota he jo anuprayog delivery ke liye cloud computing par nirbhar karata he, yaa jo vishesh rup se cloud sevaaon kii delivery ke liye dizin kiya jaataa he or jo, kisi maamle main, iske bina aavashyak rup se anupayogi hota he
 for example: cloud buniyadi saranchana, jaise ek seva ke rup main buniyadi saranchana, computer kii buniyadi saranchana kii delivery he, praroopik rup se ek seva ke rup main, ek platform abhasikaran vaataavaran he
 for example: ek cloud platform, jaise ek seva ke rup main platform, computing platform kii delivery he or / yaa ek seva ke rup main samaadhaan kaa ambaar he, jo iske tahat upasthit hardware or software paraton ke prabandhan or kray kii jatilta or laagat ke bina anuprayog ko lagu karne ko badhaava detii he
 for example: ek cloud seva main "utpaada, sevaayen or samaadhaan shaamil hai jo internet par vaastavik samay main deliver or upbhog kiye jate hai
 " udhaaharan ke liye, web sevaayen jo anya cloud computing avyavon, software, udhaaharan software plus sevaayen, yaa sidhe antim upyogkarta ke liye sulabh ho sakati hai
 Typical examples include: cloud saranchana cloud computing kii delivery main shaamil software system kii system saranchana, hardware or software se bani hoti he, jise ek cloud vaastukar ke dwaara dizin kii jaati he, jo praroopik rup se ek cloud ekikaran ke liye kaam karata he
 It typically includes several cloud components that communicate with each other over application programming interfaces, typically web services
 yah unics darshan se bahut adhik miltaa julata he jisamen bahul program hote hai, jo ek cheez ko acchhee tarah se karte hai or saarvbhaumik interphes par ek saath mil kar kaam karte hai
 Complexity is controlled and the resulting systems are more manageable than monolithic counterparts
