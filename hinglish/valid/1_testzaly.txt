 1526 main, babar ne dilli ke sultaanon main aakhri sultan, ibrahim shah lodi, ko panipat ke pehle yuddh main haraaya

 electrocardiography twachaa ke vidyut chaalkon se ek niyat samay ke liye hryday kii vaidyut gatividhi ko baahar se record kiye jane kii parvaksheeya vyakhya he
 This is a non-proliferative recording generated by an electrocardiographic device

 The ECG works primarily by detecting and expanding subtle electrical changes on the skin at the time the heart muscle is depolarized during each heartbeat
 vishram kii sthiti main, hriday ke prayek mansapeshi koshika kii bahari diwaar, yaa koshika jhilli ke ek sire se duusare sire tak ek aavesh hota he
 Reducing this charge to zero is called depolarization that activates the mechanisms of the cell that cause it to shrink

 3- and 5-lead ecgs have a tendency to be constantly monitored and screened to an appropriate monitoring device, for example during a surgery or while being transported in an ambulance
 Depending on the equipment used, 3- and 5-lead ecgs may or may not have a permanent record

 It is possible to change the output of most ECG devices, but it is standard to show each millivolt as 1 cm on the y axis and every second on the x-axis as 25 mm
 More rapid paper speeds can be used - for example - to determine more nuanced details in the ECG
 paper kii gati 25 mimi / second rakh kar, isiji kaagaj ke ek chote block ko kii gati main 40 milisecond main parivartit hota he
 Five small blocks combine to form one large block, which converts into 200 milliseconds
 isliye, pratisecond paanch bade block hai
 a calibration signal can be included to record simultaneously
 1 milivolt kaa maanak sanket shalaka ko urdhwadhar rup se 1 semi aage khiskaa saktaa he, jo isiji kaagaj par do bade varg hote hai
 a 12-lead ECG will, by definition, represent a small segment of each 12-lead recording
 It is often arranged in a grid consisting of 4 columns and three queues, with the first column being limb leads, the second column being augmented limb leads and the last two columns being chest leads
 aamtaur par is abhivinyas main parivartan karnaa sambhav he isliye yah dekhne ke liye labalon kii jaanch karnaa aavashyak he ki kis lead ko darshaya gaya he
 Typically each column will record the same moment in time for the three leads and then the recording will be moved to the next column which will record the heart beats after that point
 hriday ke taalon ke liye lead ke cholemon ke bich parivartit hona sambhav he
 Depending on the heart rate, each of these segments is small and it can be difficult to analyze any heart rhythms that indicate changes between heart beats
 vishleshan main madad karne ke liye ek yaa do "taal pattee" ko bhi mudrit karnaa aam baat he
 This will usually be Lead II and it indicates the rhythm for the entire time the ECG is recorded
 The term "rhythm bar" can refer to the entire printed record of a continuous inspection system that can represent only one lead and is either It is initiated by the doctor or it begins in response to a danger signal or event
 vidyutahridlekh main "lead" shabd bahut adhik bhram paidaa karata he kyonki iskaa prayog do bhinn baton ko suchit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 According to common language the term lead can be used to denote the electrical cable connecting the electrical conductors with the ECG recorder
 vaise to "baayin bahu vaale lead" ko vidyut chaalak ke rup main ullekh karnaa sweekaarya ho saktaa he jise baayin bahu ke nikat joda janaa chahie
 a standard "12-lead" ECG typically has ten electrical conductors
 vaikalpik rup se lead shabd do vidyut chaalkon ke bich voltata ke antar evam isiji recorder ke dwaara vaastavik rup se utpaadit baat kaa pataa lagane ko suchit kar saktaa he
 Each will have a unique name
 udhaaharan ke liye, "lead I" daayin bahu vaale vidyut chaalak evam baayin bahu vaale electrode ke bich voltata he, jabaki "lead II" daayen limb evam paad ke bich voltata he
 These types of leads form "12-lead" ecgs
 atirikt bhram paidaa karne ke liye aam taur par "limb lead" limb ke saath sanlagn vidyut chaalkon kii bajaay lead I, II evam III se praapt lekhachitreey record ko suchit karata he
 Shorter descent === Determination of electrical conductors === Ten power conductors are used for 12-lead ecgs
 aam taur par vidyut chaalkon main ek chaalak gel hota he, jo ek swayan chipakane vaale pad ke bich main ant:sthapit hota he jisamen cabel ko clip kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes gels also act as adhesive material
 unhen marij ke sharir main nimnaankit tareeke se label evam sthapit kiya jaataa he
 Classical 12-lead ecgs can be expanded in a number of ways as an attempt to improve its microbial ability to identify cardiac arrest, which includes areas that are not typically "seen" well
 Can
 isamen ek rv4 lead shaamil hota he jo V4 ke samatuly mahatv vaale chihnon kaa chaati kii diwaar ke daahine taraf prayog karata he evam chest lead ko peeth par V7, V8 evam V9 ke dwaara failaata he
 In both 5- and 12-lead configurations, leads I, II and III are called limb leads
 in sanketon ko utpann karne vaale vidyut chaalak limb par sthit hote hai - ek prayek bahu par evam ek baanye taang par
 limb lead un binduon kaa nirmaan karte hai jinhen eenthoven ke trikon ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 For example, simplified electromagnetic sensors designed for the purpose of teaching at the high school level are generally limited to three-arm power conductors that serve the same purpose
 lead do prakaar ke hote hai: ekadhruviya or dwidhruvi 
 dwidhruvi lead main ek dhanatmak evam ek rinatmak dhruv hota he
 In a 12-lead ECG, limb leads are bipolar leads
 ekadhruviya lead main bhi do dhruv hote hai, jaise ki voltata kii maap kii jaati he; haalanki, rin dhruv ek sanyukt dhruv jo kai anya vidyut chaalkon ke sanketon kaa bana hua hota he
 In a 12-lead ECG, all but the limb leads are unipolar
 wilson kaa kendriya terminal VW RA; LA; evam LL vidyut chaalkon ko ekasaath, ek saamaanya pratirodh kshamta vaale network ke madhyam se, vidyut chaalkon ko jodakar taiyaar kiya jaataa he jisase ki sampurna nikaay main ausat vibhav aropit kiya ja sake, jo anant main vibhav ke lagbhag hota he
 aavr, avl and avf leads are augmented leads
 unhen usee teen vidyut chaalkon se lead I, II evam III ke rup main liye gaye hai
 However, they view the heart from different angles because the negative power driver for these leads is the conversion of Wilson's central terminal
 yah rin vidyut chaalak ko prabhaavaheen kar detaa he or dhanatmak vidyut chaalkon ko "anveshak vidyut chaalak" banane detaa he
 This is possible because Enthoven's law says that i + + III = 0
 The equation can also be written i + III = II
 It is written as Einthoven completely changed the polarity of Lead II in Einthoven's triangle, perhaps because they wanted to look directly at the QRS assemblies
 wilson ke kendriya terminal ne sanvardhit limb lead avr, avl, avf evam purohrideey lead V1, V2, V3, V4, V5 evam V6 ke vikaas kaa maarg prashast kiya
 The augmented limb leads avr, avl, and avf are expanded in this way because the negative terminal conductor Wilson is not useful when the signal is too small to be centrally located
 lead I,II, evam III ke saath-saath, sanvardhit lead avr, avl, evam avf chah aksheeya sandarbh pranali kaa aadhaar taiyaar karte hai, jiskaa upyog agrapashchaj tal main hriday ke vaidyut aksh kii gananaa karne main kiya jaataa he
 The avr, avl, and avf leads can also be expressed using i and II limb leads: purohrideey lead ke liye vidyut chaalkon ko sidhe chaati par sthapit kiya jaataa he
 Due to their proximity to the heart, they do not require augmentation
 wilson ke kendriya terminal kaa prayog rinatmak vidyut chaalak ke liye kiya jaataa he or in leedon ko ekadhruviya mana jaataa he 
 purohrideey lead hriday kii vaidyut gatividhi ko tathakthith kshaitij tal main dekhte hai
 In the horizontal plane, the electrical axis of the heart is reported as the z axis
 hriday chakra ke ek vishisht isiji anurekhan main ek pi tarang, ek kyuares samshti, ek tii tarang, evam 50 se 75% isiji main saamaanya rup se dikhaai dene vaale you tarang shaamil hote hai
 The baseline voltage of the electrocardiography is called isoelectric line
 aam taur samavidyutvibhav rekha ko tii tarang ke parvarti evam agle pi tarang ke purvavarti anurekhan ke bhaag ke rup main mapa jaataa he
 Originally there were four deviations, but after the mathematical modification introduced by the initial amplifier, five deviations were discovered
 inthoven ne anurekhan kii pahchaan karne ke liye pi, kyuu, aar, es or tii aksharon ko chunaa jise asanshodhit labelayukt e, bi, si or di ke upar adhyaropit kiya gaya
 The interpretation of the ECG relies on the idea that different leads approach the heart from different "perspectives"
 iske do laabh hai
 First, lead showing the problem can be used to predict which region of the heart is affected
 duusare, vidhruvikaran ke tarang kii yatra kii samgr disha kaa bhi anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he jo anya samasyaon ko prakat kar sakate hai
 This is called cardiac axis
 hriday sambandhi aksh kaa nirdhaaran sadish kii avadharana par nirbhar karata he jo vidhruvikaran tarang kii gati kaa varnan karata he
 This vector can then be described in relation to the direction of the considered lead as its components
 ek ghatak lead kii disha main hoga he or ise kyuares samshti ke vyavhaar main prakat kiya jayega evam ek ghatak isse 90 degree par hoga 
 kyuares samshti kaa dhanatmak nival vikshepan yah suzav detaa he ki dhruvikaran kaa tarang hriday se hokar us disha main fail rahaa he jiske kuch ghatak lead kii hi disha main hote hai
 The electrical axis of the heart indicates the general direction of the depolarizing wavelet of the heart in the frontal plane
 ek swasth sanchaalan pranali ke dwaara hriday sambandhi aksh us bhaag se sambandhit hota he jahaan hriday ke mukhya manshapeshi kaa vishaal aakaar sthit hota he
 It is usually the left ventricle with some role of the right ventricle
 aamtaur par yah baanye pair kii disha main daanye kandhe main abhivinyast hota he, jo chah aksheeya sandarbh pranali ke baanye nimna chaturth bhaag ke sangat hota he, haalanki −30° se +90° ko saamaanya mana jaataa he
 If the left ventricle increases in its activity or larger size, it is called the "deviation of the left axis" because the axis quickly shifts to the left more than -30 °, optionally in situations where the right ventricle is strained or enlarged
 Is then the axis turns more than + 90 ° and it is said that "right axis deflection" exists
 hriday ke chaalan pranali ke vikaar mansapeshi ke vishaal aakaar main mahatvapurn parivartan darshaye bina vidyutiya aksh ko baadhit kar sakate hai
 In an adjustment with a right bundle branch block, a deviation of the right or left axis may indicate a bipolar block
 kul baarah lead hote hai, jinamein se prayek vibhinn drushtikon se hriday ke vidyutiya gatividhi kaa record karata he, jo gambhir hriddhamni sambandhi sthanik-araktata yaa chot kii pahchaan karne ke uddeshy se hriday ke vibhinn shaareerik kshetron ko paraspar sambandhit karata he
 The two leads that observe adjacent anatomical regions of the heart are contiguous
 Its relevance lies in determining whether abnormalities in the ECG may indicate true disease or false findings
 iske alaava, koi bhi do purohrideey lead jo ek-duusare ke bagal main sthit hote hai, sate hue maane jate hai
 For example, although V4 is a frontal lead and V5 is a lateral lead, they are contiguous because they are located next to each other
 lead avr baanye nilay kaa koi vishisht drishy nahin prastut karata he
 Rather, it looks from the inner part of the wall to the surface of the right atrium by looking at the right shoulder
 aadhunik isiji monitor sanket prakraman ke liye vividh filter pradaan karte hai
 The most common adjustments are monitor mode and diagnostic mode
 monitor mod main, kam aavriti vaale filter ko yaa to 0
5 hertz yaa 1 hertz par samyojit kiya jaataa he evam ucch aavriti vaale filter ko 40 hertz par samyojit kiya jaataa he
 This dilution limits regular heart rhythm monitoring
 ucch-paas filter asthir aadhaar-rekha ko kam karne main madad karata he evam nimna-paas filter 50 yaa 60 hertz power line vaale shor ko kam karne main madad karata he 
 naidanik mod main, ucch paas filter ko 0
05 hertz par samyojit kiya jaataa he, jo sateek asti khand ko record karne kii anumati pradaan karata he
 The low-pass filter is adjusted at 40, 100, or 150 Hz
 parinamswaroop, isiji kaa monitor mod pradarshan naidaniki mod kii tulana main adhik filter kiya hua hota he, kyonki iskaa pasband adhik patala hota he
 Symptoms commonly reported when using electrocardiography include: iskaa prayog sarvadaihik rog se peedit marijon kaa moolyankan karne or saath hi sangyaaharan ke dauraan nirikshan karne evam gambhir rup se biimaar marijon ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 Electromagnetic diversity is the measure of the magnitude of variation between one ECG wave form and another

 Recent research suggests that often ecg-related variations precede dangerous cardiac dysrhythmias
 bhavishya main, vividhta kii maap evam khoj karne ke liye pratiropneey upkaran kaa program taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he
 These devices can help to effectively remove the malaise by stimulating nerves such as the vagus nerve, giving drugs such as beta blockers, and, if necessary, to deform the heart

 He wrote 唐 手: か ら て in Kanji instead of the currently used 空手: か ら て
 The Tang dynasty of China ended in AD 907
 baad main okinawa main aamtaur par china ko sanderbhit karne ke ek tareeke ke rup main kanji ne iskaa pratinidhitiv kiya
 Thus the term karate was originally a way of expressing "chinese hand", or "martial art of China"
 is par dhyaan dena aavashyak he ki likhe hue shabdon kaa prayog kaa karate ke mul se judaa hona jaruri nahin he
 The original use of "chinese Hand", "tang Hand", "chinese Fist" or "chinese Technique" shows evidence of Chinese influence on Chinese Karate

 The addition of du to the end of the word karate is another indicative development
 du ek pratyay he or iske kai arth hai jisamen sadak, path, maarg or tarika shaamil he
 It is used in many martial arts that survived the feudal culture of Japan during modern times
 This means that these arts are not just a combat system but also include a metaphysics when encouraged as a practice
 is sandarbh main du kaa aam taur par anuwaad "jis tarah" ke rup main he
 Examples are aikido, judo and kendo
 Karatedu is thus little more than emt hand techniques
 yah jis tarah amty hand he

 Dr
 Schiller has proposed a theory called Humanitarianism which should really be considered a branch of consequentialism
 james kii to praaia: sabhi kritiyaan is vichaardhaara par aadhaarit hai
 James was often a staunch opponent of spiritualism, especially Hegelian spiritualism
 unhen prayogpriy evam bahyavastuvaadi amareeki janata kaa vaicharik pratinidhi kahana anuchit na hoga
 When he was engaged in the idea of a criterion of truth that was entirely different from the metaphysical paradigm, he wrote "how do we make our ideas clear" in an American monthly paper called "pupular Science" in January, 1878
 - Read the article and after finding the basic framework of modern consequentialism, he became convinced that this is the criterion of truth or truth
 peers ko, jaisaa swayan unhone hi kaha he, falanumeyapramanyawad kaa sabhanarthvachi "pregametism" shabd or uskaa bhav donon hi germany ke suprasiddh darshanik kaant kii kritiyon se mili the
 But even while showing the antiquity of this ideology, James considers himself especially grateful to Peers and has honored him as a pioneer of modern consequentialism in philosophy
 jo bhi ho, is siddhant ko bal evam prakhyati pradaan karne main swayan james kaa hi naam sarvopar ullekhneey he
 All the well-known texts such as his "principles of Psychology", "miscellaneous Forms of Religious Experience", "consequentialism", "meaning of Truth" and "the Nine World" support this ideology
 unke na keval taarkik vichaar hi kintu manovaigyanik evam tathvik-sabhi prakaar ke vichaar falanumeyapramanyawaadee pravriti ke suspasht pratik hai
 According to James "truth is the name of all things that prove themselves superior in the way of faith, and also for certain specific things"
 sankshep main, "satya vichaar kii prakriya kaa ek yogya yaa uchit upkaran maatr hota he, thik vaise hi jaise "shubh" hamaare vyaavhaarik jivan kaa ek safal saadhan maatr; vah kisi bhi prakaar se laabhprad or, vastut:, antatogatva tathaa sab baton ko dhyaan main rakhane par laabhadaayak he
 "james considers truth to be the cash value of our personal perceptions, not objective facts
 unke anusaar ham swayan apane satyon kaa nirmaan karte hai
 They are not merely reactions of external objects; But the seekers of our purposes are our only faith
 ham un vishwaason ko jo hamen bhavatmak tripti yaa vyaavhaarik safalataa pradaan karte hai satya maanane lagate hai, or iske vipareet parinamawaalon ko asaty
 Therefore, the veracity of our beliefs or thoughts is permissible by their result or result
 uske sthapit hone ke liye samay or anubhav kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Just as we get success in behavior with a belief, so also its truth increases
 hamaare simit anubhav dwaara pramanit hamaari kisi bhi aasthaa ko purnataya satya kahalaane kaa adhikaar nahin, yahan tak ki vigyaan ke tathakthith prakritik niyamon ko bhi purna rup se satya nahin kaha ja saktaa
 We have the right to say as much as possible that as far as our experiences are concerned, they have proved to be true; But this does not prove their eternal truth
 purna satya ke liye purna anubhav, jiskaa hona kabhi sambhav nahin, apekshit he
 Therefore, any truth propounded by humans, whether it is scientific or whether it is scientific or logical, cannot be absolute truth
 jinhen praaia: manushya siddh-satya yaa siddhant sajaate hai unhen falanumeyapramanyawaadee keval upakalpana hi maanate hai
 They strongly criticize rationalist logic and corrupt their principles of justice
 ve maanviya vichaaron ko, buddhivaadee tarkshastriyon kii manyata ke viruddh, sadaiv prayojnatmak maanate hai, ni:swaarth nahin
 The Indian method of testing the truthfulness of knowledge called "tendency, strength and tendencyism", according to which the successor knowledge is considered to be true or false knowledge is inexact or false when it comes into action, resembling this consequential phenomenological method
 parantu, saath hi saath, "tadvati tatprakaarkan gyaanan yathartham" evam tadbhaavvati tatprakaarkan gyaanan bhram:" kahanevaala kattar vastuvaadi nyaayadarshan anurupatavaad kaa samarthak prathit hota he, jab ki james aadi paashchaatya falanumeyapramanyawaadiyon ne uski katu aalochana kii he
 Just as in Satyasatya deliberation, similarly in the interpretation of mental processes or ideas, the consequentialist primevalists give a major place to our practical actions
 unke anusaar, ham na keval apane satyon kaa hi kintu vividh anubhavon kaa bhi nirmaan karte hai
 Our primary or basic experience is like an uninterrupted stream and we divide it into various substances and their interrelationships, inspired by self-interest and self-interest, through our mental actions of analyzing and choosing, etc
 is prakaar, inke manovigyaan or lock aadi ke parmanuwaadi manovigyaan main, jiske anusaar hamaare vichaar praarambhik saral pratyayon ke ek yantric dhang se sangrahit anukram maane jate hai, moulik antar he
 Atomicist psychology is an imitation of the physical science of the same name, which is far from the reality and misleading in the eyes of the consequentialists
 vishwaason yaa vichaaron ke satyatvasatyatv ke pareekshan main falanumeyapramanyawaadee vidhi sweekaar karanevaalon main tatvagyan sambandhi mataiky nahin
 Nevertheless, if any philosophy can be said to be a counterpoint to this ideology, it is the doctrinal principle propounded by Dr
 Schiller in the book "studies in Humanism", supported by Prof
 Dui
 iske anusaar, ham swayan hi sadaiv ek badi had tak or sahi arth main vaastaviktaa kaa nirmaan karte rahete hai, kyonki prayek tathakthi yatharth vastu hamaare tatsambandhi gyaan par ashrith rahati he
 There is no known substance whose form is not determined and created by us, especially by its being known
 parmaarthiktaa kya he yah ham nahin jaanate or na uske vishay main, nishchay rup se, kuch kaha hi ja saktaa he
 But as far as known reality continues to form, because every and every real thing depends on our knowledge
 koi bhi gyaat padaarth aisa nahin hota jiskaa swaroop hamaare dwaara uske gyaat hone se, vishesh rup se, nirdhaarit evam nirmit na hota ho
 We do not know what altruism is, and nothing can be said about it, of course
 parantu jahaan tak gyaat vaastaviktaa kaa sambandh he yah nishchay he ki uskaa swaroop nirman, ek atyant mahatvapurn ansh main, hamaar or hamaare us gyaan ke upar nirbhar rahata he jisapar hamaare prayojanon or swaarthon kii chhap anivaaryat lagi rahati he
 Our facts are those in which their Nirmapika have the power or ability to satisfy our desires
 jis prakaar satya hamaare safal vishwaas hote hai usee prakaar tathy hamaari ichchhaaon ko santushti pradaan karanevaale padaarth hote hai
 In short, successful functional effectiveness in our practical life should be understood, according to these thinkers, as a sign of fact or reality
 bhartiya buddha darshan kii sat kii paribhaasha bhi, jiske anusaar "sat vah he jisamen kisi kaary ko utpann karne kii kshamta ho", falanumeyapramanyawaadee vichaardhaara ke anukool prathit hoti he, kyonki usamen bhi vastuon ke sattvaasatva, astitv, anstitv, ke nirdhaaran main unke kaaryrup fal ko hi nirnaayak mana he
 But in many other philosophical matters, all Buddhist philosophers neither agree with each other nor with the modern philanthropist
 ek maanavtaavaadi darshan hone ke kaaran prayojanavaad sansar evam uski vastuon tathaa kriyaaon ke kaarnon par us gambhirtha se vichaar nahin karata jitna maanav jivan main uski upyogita par vichaar karata he
 In order to protect its existence as an independent philosophy, Purposeism has laid down the following basic principles, considering the reasons of the world and its actions, making human the basis
 atah spasht he ki prayojanavaadee kabhi adarshavaadiyon kaa samarthan karte hai to kabhi prakrutivaadiyon kaa
 In this way, they place themselves between these two 'vados'

 Chandragupta Vikramaditya King of Gupta Dynasty
 chandragupta dwitiya mahaan jinako sanskrit main vikramaditya yaa chandragupta vikramaditya ke naam se janaa jaataa he; gupt vansh ke ek mahaan shaktishaalee samraat the
 His kingdom lasted till 380-412 AD in which the Gupta dynasty attained its peak
 gupt samrajya kaa vah samay bharat kaa svarnim yug bhi kaha jaataa he
 Chandragupta II the Great was the son of his former king Samudragupta the Great
 usne aakraamak vistaar kii niti evam laabhdayak parigrahan niti kaa anusaar karke safalataa praapt kii
 Chandragupta II It is clear from Vikramaditya Samudragupta's epigraphy that many of his sons were grandchildren, but in his last time he appointed Chandragupta as his successor
 chandragupta dwitiya evam parvarti guptasamraaton ke abhilekhon se bhi yahi dhvanit hota he ki samudragupta kii mrityu ke uparaant chandragupta dwitiya hi guptasamrat hue
 But on the contrary, some scholars certify Ramgupta as the successor of Samudragupta on the basis of 'devi Chandragupta' and some other literary and archaeological inscriptions available in part
 ramgupta kii ayogyata kaa laabh uthaakar chandragupta ne uske rajya evam rani donon kaa haran kar liya
 The historicity of Ramgupta is doubtful
 bhilsa aadi se praapt tamra sikkon kaa ramgupta us pradesh kaa koi sthaneey shaasha hi rahaa hoga
 The date of Chandragupta II is determined based on his inscriptions etc
 chandragupta kaa, guptasanwat 61 main utkeern mathura stambhalekh, unke rajya ke paanchaven varsh main likhaaya gaya tha
 As a result, he ascended the Guptas in 61-5 = 56 = 375 AD
 chandragupta dwitiya kii antim gyaat tithi unki rajathamudraon par praapt haati he- guptasanwat 90+ 0= 409- 410 i

 From this one can infer that Chandragupta was probably ruling for the above mentioned year
 iske vipareet kumargupta pratham kii pratham gyaat tithi guptasanwat 96= 415 i
, unke bilsand abhilekh se praapt hoti he
 On this basis, it is estimated that the reign of Chandragupta II may have ended in 413–14 AD
 chandragupta dwitiya ke vibhinn lekhon se gyaat devgupt evam devraj-anya naam prathit hote hai
 Records and Mudra inscriptions give knowledge of his various titles - Maharajadhiraja, Parambhagavat, Srivikram, Narendrachandra, Narendra Singh, Vikramank and Vikramaditya etc

 chandragupta ke sandhivigrahik virasen shaab ke udaygiri guhaalekh se, unka samast prithvi jatine ke uddeshy se vahaan tak aana spasht he
 His long-standing presence in the Malava region is evident from the writings of the Gupta Samvat 82 of the feudatory ruler of Chandragupta, Sanakaniq Maharaj, and the Sanchi Gupta Samvat 93 of a magistrate named Amarkardava, obtained from this place
 sambhavat: chandragupta dwitiya ne shaq rudrasingh tritiy ke viruddh yusanchalan tathaa vijayoparant saurashtra ke shashan ko yaheen se vyavasthit kiya ho
 Chandragupta's Shakavijaya is also estimated from his Rajatamudras
 saurashtra kii shaqmudra parampara ke anukaran main prachlit in mudraon se bhi hota he
 Chandragupta ii's picture, name, Virud and date of Mudrachalana are written on these postures prevalent in imitation of Saukamudra tradition of Saurashtra
 shaq mudraon se gyaat antim tithi 388 i
 prathit hoti he
 In contrast, the first date of Chandragupta known from these coins is Guptasamvat 90+ 0
 falat: anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki chandragupta kii sarashtravijay praaia: 20 varshon ke sudeergh yuddh ke pashchaat 409 i
 ke baad hi kabhi purnroopen safal hui hogi
 Chandragupta's army chief Amarkardava, in his Sanchi inscription, calls himself, many Samaravaptavijayyasupatakas
 in anek samaron ke ullekh se yah bhi anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki chandragupta ne shakayuddh ke atirikt anya yuddh bhi kiye honge
 But in the present situation his discussion is unproven
 dilli main qutubameenar ke parshv main sthit lauhastambh par kinhin chandra kii vijayprashasti utkeern he
 Chandra has been identified with various emperors of ancient India
 kintu praaia: vidvan unki pahchaan chandragupta dwitiya se karte hai
 If this theory is believed to be correct, then it will not be said that the second Chandragupta defeated the enemies who came in the organization of Vanga region and crossed the seven faces of the Indus and won the Vahlikas
