 Migration of birds or migration of birds is a very important part of ornithology
 unka yah pravrajan, rituparivartan ke samaan niyamit or kramik hota he or yug-yug se yah manushyon main utsukata or jigyaasa utpann karata rahaa he, yahan tak ki red indianon ne apane kalendar ke maheenon ke naam pravrajan karanevaali chidiyon ke aagaman par hi rakhaa he
 Landborough Tomson, a recognized scholar of the subject of bird migration, has described the migration as follows: bahut purv aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki jis prakaar kuch stanpayi or urag sharad ritu main thand se bachane ke liye sheetanishkriyata main chale jate hai, usee bhanti ababil, kalvinkak or koyal bhi shitashayan karti hai
 Such a belief had been prevalent since Aristotle's time
 ushnraktata, pankh or udaan kii adbhut shakti ke kaaran chidiyon main sthanparivartan karne kii kshamta kaa vikaas bahut adhik hua he
 Although birds are more tolerant of both extreme cold or extreme heat than other animals, they are forced to migrate when there is a lack of food in the autumn, otherwise they may die
 pravrajan ke dwaara chidiyon ko do pratikul rituon main bhi do anukool kshetra praapt ho jate hai
 In one region they live and breed and in another region go for food and rest
 yah prakruti kaa vidhaan he ki chidiya pravrajan kshetra ke thande bhaag main hi andey detii hai
 Hence their mating area in the Northern Hemisphere is the Arctic North Pole or temperate zone, but in contrast to the Southern Hemisphere, winter habitat is near the equator
 praaia: pravrajan uttar se dakshin kii ore hota he, yadhyapi kuch pravrajan purv se pashchim kii ore bhi hota he
 Migration ranges from a few kilometers to thousands of kilometers, as some birds descend from the higher elevations of the Himalayas to the plains of northern India and some thousands of kilometers to the south
 sabase adhik dur kaa pravrajan uttar dhruviya kurri karti he
 This migration occurs twice every year
 yah arctic ke sheetkaal main dakshin kii ore deshaagaman karti he, sansar ko paar kar dakshin dhruv antarctic main greeshm ritu bitaakar pun: waapas hoti he
 In this way, the journey of one way to and from the journey covers a distance of about 17,742 km
 chidiyon main pravrajan kaa aarambh hone ke sambandh main anek siddhant pratipadit hai
 Sparrows have the following benefits from migration: chidiyon kaa pravrajan pakshi kii ant: or bahya donon hi uttejnaaon par nirbhar karata he
 Experiments reveal that the change in the time period of the external stimuli is prominent; The internal stimulation is produced by hormones produced by the genitals
 pravrajan kaa lakshyasthaan kaise nirdhaarit hota he or chidiyaan is gantavy sthaan kaa rasta kaise maaloom karti hai, inkaa anek prayogon or prekshanon se par bhi abhi tak santoshjanak uttar nahin mil sakaa he
 In the spring, after the autumn, the first return of adult males occurs in the breeding area or summer-dwelling area
 iske baad vayask maadaaen or ant main avyask chidiyaan pahunchati hai
 But in the autumn this sequence is reversed
 pratham avyask pakshi or maadaaen dakshini yatra ke liye prasthaan karti hai or baad main vayask nar
 The journey to the south takes a lot of leisure and stops from place to place
 chote bachche athwa kishor, jinaki umr kuch hi maheenon kii hoti he, kafile kaa pathpradarshan karte hai or vayask baad main unka anusaran karte hai
 How does this happen? There have been many interpretations of this
 unamem se adhik sweekrut mat yah he ki anek pidiyon ke prati varsh pravrajan ke kaaran pakshiyon main anya janmajaat gunon, jaise thik samay par, bina kisi purv anubhav ke, jatiparampara ke anusaar ek vishesh prakaar kaa need nirmaan karnaa he, usee bhanti bina kisi purv anubhav ke pravrajan bhi ek janmajaat gun ho gaya he
 How do birds find the way to remote territories? There are many hypotheses about this, some of which are subtle sensitivity to the magnetism of the Earth, identification by sight of landmarks etc
 kintu purvanubhavvihin kal kii chidiyon main dur gantavy sthaan or uske path ko nirdhaaran ab bhi rahasyamay bana hua he
 Just as a man travels to the faraway and then returns to his home, just as the birds travel thousands of kilometers and spend the autumn in a remote place, not only reach their summer-residence area, but also They also reach the nest
 chidiyon ko challa pehanaane kii vidhi se yah sthapit ho gaya he ki europe main ababil praaia: na keval usee basti main pahunch jaati he, balki usee ghar main jisko chhodkar vah sudur kii yatra par gai thi, pahunch jaati he
 The abbeel covers a distance of 9,677 kilometers in this journey
 yaheen baat anya vaastavik pravrajan karanevaali chidiyon main bhi pai jaati he
 Some known facts published as a result of many years of inspection reveal that the birds not only reach their habitat and old nid, but also return on the exact day they returned in the previous year
 atev jab itani lambii yatra karti hon to ek nishchit samay par lautakar pakshiyon kaa apane ghonsle main upasthit ho janaa or bhi ascharyajanak he
 The position of each autumn bird in the winter in different regions of India varies
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi bhi sthaan ko le len, jaise madhya bharat kaa bhopal kshetra
 Most species of birds, which travel from north or northwest frontier regions in the autumn, to the far south or to Lanka, through that country, go through Bhopal
 in yatriyon main se kuch to peeche rah jate hai or ve sharad ritu bhar bhopal main dekhen ja sakate hai
 We can classify these under the actual autumn, but some remain only for a short time upon the arrival of autumn and do not appear thereafter as they have departed from there to travel further
 ve pun: greeshm ritu ke prarambh main, jab ve uttar kii taraf lautate hote hai, dikhaai padate hai
 They are migrating travelers in autumn and spring
 kuch to sharad ritu main, jab dakshin kii yatra par hote hai, tab to dikhaai padate hai, kintu jab ve vasant main pun: apane nivas kii ore lautate hote hai, tab dikhaai nahin padate, kyonki ve kisi duusare maarg se hokar laut jate hai
 Hence those birds appear in Bhopal in autumn and in spring in some other part
 kuch chidiyaan desh ke andar hi ek bhaag se duusare bhaag main sthanparivartan karti hai, jaise shah bulbul yaa dudhnju, sunaharaa polak or naurang 
 This local migration occurs more in the northern part of the country or in the foothills of the mountains, where seasonal changes are more effective than in the equator
 vaastavik pravrajan karanevaali chidiyon kii bhanti inamen bhi pravrajan kramik or niyamit hota he
 In some parts of the country, some caste arrive in summer, some caste in rain and some caste in autumn
 iske atirikt ek anya prakaar kaa bhi sthanparivartan baraabar hota rahata he, jo aahaar par prabhaav daalanevaali sthaneey paristhitiyon, jaise garmi, sookhaa yaa baadh ityadi, athwa kisi vishesh prakaar ke phool lagane or fal pakane kii ritu, ke kaaran hota he
 At that time sparrows move from one area to another
 kabhi-kabhi asaadhaaran paristhitiyon se baadhya hokar apane upyukt nivasasthaan kii chhodkar bhojan kii talash main chidiyaan kisi anya kshetron main bhi bhraman karti hui pai jaati hai
 Therefore, the population of birds is not constant in any area at any given time, because the arrival and regularization of birds in all the areas is always happening
 himalay ke unche pahaado main rahanevaali chidiyaan jaade main neeche utar aati he or is prakaar tufaani mausam or himrekha se neeche chali aati he
 On the arrival of spring, when the ice begins to thaw and the ice line rises upward, they climb again into the upper reaches of the mountains to lay eggs
 yah kram keval oonchaai main rahanevaale pakshiyon main hi nahin varan neeche rahanevaali chidiyon main bhi chalata rahata he
 In addition to gaining scientific knowledge of sparrows migration, light and inscribed rings of aluminum are worn in the majority of sparrows' feet in Britain and the United States
 yah vidhi america main pakshivalayan athwa pakshipatbandhan kehalaati he
 In addition to the serial number, the address of the place is also mentioned
 chidiyon ko anguthi pahanaakar unka purna vivaran ek pustika main likh kar unhen chhod diya jaataa he
 Now on reaching remote places of these sparrows, their ring is taken off by hitting or trapping them and they are sent to the address from where they flew
 jab kaaphi sankhya main is prakaar kii talika ikatthi ho jaati he tab in talikaon kaa vishleshan karke uske aadhaar par kisi vishesh jati kii chidiya ke pravrajan ke maarg athwa anya kisi samasya kaa hal nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, it has been established with certainty and doubtless as a result of the white buck's burrowing in West Germany and the eastern region that the birds of East Asia travel through the southeastern route to Africa, while the white buck of West Germany The South Western route leads to Africa via Spain
 bikaner main isi prakaar kii anguthidhari chidiyon ke praapt hone se hamen pataa chalaa he ki kuch shwet bak jo hamaare desh main, sharad ritu main, aate hai, ve germany ke hote hai
 In India, this type of advocacy has done very little
 kintu jitna kuch hua he usase praapt suchnaayen bahut hi mahatvapurn or upyogi siddh hui hai
 The speed of migrating birds is different in different birds and this speed depends on many things like wind direction, weather etc
 batakhon or hanson main udaan kii gati 64 se 80 kilometre prati ghante pai gai he or anukool mausam main yah gati 90 se 97 kilometre yaa isse adhik pai gai he
 This speed is 9
5 to 17
7 kilometers per hour in birds flying continuously during the day and night
 nimnlikhit sarini se yah anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki ek baar kii udaan main koun chidiya kitni duuri tay karti he : The Eastern Golden Titibh flies continuously without stopping anywhere and crosses the open sea of 3226
00 km
 yah tittibh sharad ritu main, bharat main bhraman karne aate hai
 It lays eggs in western Alaska and northeastern Sibiria and regularly tours the Hawaiian Islands
 chaha jisaki maadaa keval japan main andey detii he, jaada purvi austrailia or tezmania main vyateet karata he, is prakaar avashya hi 4839
00 kilometre kii duuri bina kahi ruke nirantar udakar paar kar jaataa he
 There are other such birds, which go a long distance without any grain of water
 adhik dur kii yatra karanevaali bhartiya chidiyon main sambhavat: main bhandu teetar he jiskaa andey dene kaa sabase nikatavarti sthaan himalay main hai
 Some pheasants spend part of winter in Nilgiri or other hills in the south and others are not found anywhere
 isse itnaa spasht he ki ye ek udaan main kam se kam 2419
5 kilometre kii duuri avashya hi paar karte hai
 Earlier it was believed that migrating birds fly at very high altitudes, because they have the advantage of determining location, decreasing air flow, etc
 kintu ab yah paaya gaya he ki yadi kisi unchi parvatamala ko paar karnaa nahin hua to vastut: ye pravrajan karanevaali chidiyaan 396
24 meter kii oonchaai par udati hai or birli hi chidiya 914
4 meter kii oonchaai tak kii jaati he
 When the sea has to be crossed or there is no barrier of any kind of tree or mountain, then some birds naturally fly even lower than this
 haan, yadi aavashyaktaa hui to chidiyaan bahut kii adhik oonchaai se bhi ud sakati hai
 There is a mention of flying at altitudes ranging from 3
048 meters to 8229
6000 meters

 The means of transport in the hilly areas are very less
 keval ghaatiyon main kahin sadaken hoti hai, jo praaia: kachi hoti hai or inamen barf ke pighalane or varsha se baadhaayen utpann ho jaati hai
 That is why soldiers in this area have to use special materials and special types of weapons

 yah vichaar karnaa padataa he ki aise sthaan se shatru par pahari kii ore se akraman kiya jaae athwa ghati kii ore se; kyonki jis paksh kaa unchi bhoomi par adhikaar hota he vah neeche kii bhoomi or darron par bhi swadhipaty rakhata he
 Therefore, at such places, it should be a constant effort to take possession of the high land around the pass at the beginning
 akraman kii safalataa ke liye yah aavashyak he ki shatru ko dhokhe main rakhaa jaay
 The attack should happen accidentally and the enemy should not know where the attack will take place

 As a result, there is a greater chance of success

 For defending the roads, a place should be chosen where the natural design and shape of the land help in the rescue
 udaahranarth, aise unche sthaan chunane chahie jahaan se shatru ko aage badhane kaa doosraa maarg na mili
 It should also be kept in mind that the bullet can be shot on other routes of the enemy moving forward

 The enemy can shoot at them
 yadi morche pahaad ke shikhar par banaae jaayan to neeche kii dhaalon par aise kai sthaan hote hai jo dekhbhaal or goli kii maar se bache rahete hai
 At this stage, the enemy can move easily towards the height, the advantage of the fronts on the summit is that they do not fall under the enemy's direct attack and the supporting forces get good cover
 yadi morche pahaad ke peeche kii ore banaae jaayan to shatru kii golabari se yathesht bachaav ho saktaa he, parantu in morchon ke saamne kii dhaalon or neeche ghati ke margon kaa niyantran evam nirikshan karnaa kathin ho jaataa he

 shatru ke aage badhane ke raaston par bhi kai prakaar kii baadhaayen daali ja sakati hai, jaise, nadi naalon ke pul barood lagaakar udaana ityadi
 In defense, tank cannons and other artillery are deployed at such places from where it can hit the terrain from which an attack is expected
 vayuyananashi topakhana oonchaai par lagaana chahie jisase vah chaaron ore bhalee bhanti dekhbhaal or maar kar sake
 Machine guns are very beneficial for hitting tight paths
 sharad ritu main yuddh-pahari kshetra main sharatkaleen yuddh bahut kathin hota he
 In such a severe situation, special trained soldiers are required, who can stay and fight in icy places
 iske atirikt in sainikon ke liye vishesh prakaar kii yudhsaamagree kaa bhi prabandh karnaa padataa he
 Battle with unorganized armies - Sometimes armies have to fight unorganized armies of seditious people in the mountainous region

 Semiconductors are those materials whose electrical conductivity is less than conductors but greater than conductors
 silicon, jarmenium, cadmium sulphide, gallium arsenid ityadi ardhchaalak padaarthon ke kuch udhaaharan hai
 In semiconductors, there is a 'band gap' between the conduction band and the valence band, which varies from 0 to 6 electron-volts
 
 Most semiconductors used to make electronic devices are elements of group IV of the periodic table, compounds of groups III and V, antimonide), or compounds of groups II and VI
 ardhchaalak padaarth ekal crystal ke rup main ho sakate hai yaa bahucristali powder ke rup main ho sakate hai
 At present, organic semiconductors have also been made, which are often multicomponent aromatic compounds

 ardhchalkon main bahut se anya upyogi gun bhi dekhne ko milte hai, jaise kisi ek disha main duusare disha kii apeksha aasaani se dhara pravaah 
 In addition, the conductivity of semiconductors can be reduced or increased by adding a controlled amount of impurities

 aaj jarmenium or silicon ke kudhatu kaa prayog akasar ativegashali yuktiyon ke nirmaan me hota he; ai bi em ese yuktiyon kaa pramukh utpaadak he
 The use of gallium arsenide is also widespread in the manufacture of ultra-efficient devices, but this material does not form wide boules, which makes it expensive to make semiconductor devices from gallium arsenide compared to silicon

 In political science, pragmatism is an influential political theory that opposed values in political studies
 yah raajnneeti ko prakritik vigyaanon ke tarz par samajhnaa chaahati he
 Behavioral scholars saw politics as a system and tried to make it a pure science by emphasizing quantitative analysis rather than qualitative
 america vaigyanik ke anusaar vahyaravaad ko kuch bhi nahi kiya From the second decade of the twentieth century American political science began to develop trends to make political theology more and more scientific
 raajnneeti-vigyaan ke pita samajhe jane vaale charles marium ke netritv main raajnneetik vichaar kaa aitihaasik adhyayan karne ke saath-saath is vidya ko raajnneetik vyavhaar ke vaigyanik adhyayan par aadhaarit karne kii koshishen shuru ho chuki thim
 Its purpose was to make political science serve practical political goals
 marium ke ye sarokaar tees or chalis ke dashak main aaye aarthik-raajnneetik sankat ke kaaran mand ho gayi, lekin inkaa ubhaar ek baar phir pachaas ke dashak main hua
 It has been termed as a pragmatic revolution in politics which profoundly influenced the future of this discipline
the works of David Easton came to the fore saath ke dashak main is vyavhaar ke pramukh pravaktaa ke rup main david easton kii rachanaayen saamne aayin
 The Cold War was at its peak in this period, under the influence of which the urges that viewed politics from a certain value system were devalued
 america vidwaanon ne raajnneeti-vigyaan ko naagarik-shikshan or raajnneetik sudhaaron kaa zariyaa banane ke bajaay vishuddh vigyaan banane kii thaanee
 There was a rational positivism behind his resolve that originated from the womb of sensorialism
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad pachaas or saath ke dashak main nayi peedi ke samaaj-vaigyanikon ne raajnneeti kii samaj banane ke liye aupchaarik sansthaaon kii satta or praadhikaar par vichaar karne yaa raajnneetik vichaaron kaa itihaas khangaalane ke bajaay ‘tathyon ke adhyayan’ par jor dena uchit samajha
 Under this, it has been urged that a scientific study of politics is possible only when models are made to understand politics and society on the basis of facts and figures, while avoiding any kind of policy, personal or institutional trends
 aupchaarik sansthaaon kii jagah matadaataaon, hit- samoohon, raajnneetik dalon or anya raajnneetik karttaaon ke vyavhaar par roshni daali jaae
 Along with this, the modalities of the legal officers, officers and judges sitting in formal posts should be examined
 is vyavahaaravaadi samaaj- vigyaan ne raajnneetik darshan kii upyogita ko ekadam thukraa diya or sabhi tarah ke maanakeey prashnon or vichaar-vimarsh se kinaaraa kar liya
 This vision was taken from many natural sciences
 isi yojana ke tahat narmetive kii jagah imperical vishleshan paddati or anusandhan par jor diya jane laga
 Factual study and deliberation of political behavior and political processes was preferred, survey techniques were adopted, the process of understanding political systems as models began and the formulation of political behavior through analysis of statistics of elections etc
 felt
 vyavahaarwad ke is hastkshep ne raajnneetik- vigyaan main research kaa agenda puri tarah badal daalaa
 American institutions also invested heavily in such research, and pragmatist research was sparked to understand politics all over the world
 dilachasp baat yah he ki jin dinon vyavahaarwad apana dabadabaa bana rahaa tha, samaaj-vigyaan main uski aalochana bhi punap rahi thi
 Since the thirties, there was an influx of such scholars from Germany in America who were not in favor of making social science separate from their normative concerns and making them objective science
 inamen pramukh the levi-stros, erik vojalin, hanna arent, theodor adornon or harbart marcus
 In the field of scholarship, whether left or right, these scholars disagreed with the American attitude which was highly inclined towards scientificism, liberalism and historical progress
 in logon ne vyavahaarwadiyon ke is daawey kaa khandan kiya ki maanakeey aadhaar par viksit hui raajnneetik saidhaantiki kaa zamana ab guzarataa ja rahaa he
 Stross said that it is impossible to make a better understanding of politics due to the positivist attitude inherent in attempts to make politics a new science
 puure pachaas ke dashak main raajnneetik siddhant ko centre bana kar vyavahaarwad or uske aalochakon ke bich bahes chhidi rahi
 As a result, in the sixties the world of political theory was divided into three categories
 ek shrenee main ve siddhantkaar aate the jinaki praathamikta raajnneetik vichaaron ke itihaas ko centre bana kar adhyayan-manan kii thi
 The second category was based on normative political theory and the third category was based on factual empirical knowledge of political
 teesri shrenee ke pramukh hastakshar david easton, karl dush or robert dahl the jinhone jinhone ek ilaake ke tathyon kaa vishleshan karte hue model rache or saamaanya siddhanton kii rachana kar daali
 In the late sixties, pragmatists faced a new round of criticism from many fields
 raajnneeti ke adhyayan ko vishuddh vigyaan bana dene ke agrahon par aarope laga ki unke kaaran us daur ke kai saamaajik or raajnneetik muddon kii samaj viksit nahin ho paayi he
 In light of this criticism Easton rejected behaviorism amendments and called it 'post-behavioral revolution'
 sattar or assi ke dashak main vyavahaarwad kii isi sanshodhit chhavi kaa vikaas hota rahaa jiske tahat vaigyanik paddati or takanic ke saath-saath raajnneeti-vigyaan ke saamaajik or moolyagat dayitvon kaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa gaya
 Criticisms of rational positivism emerged in the seventies itself which influenced the philosophy of sociology
 yahi vah daur tha jisamen yuragan havermas, robert nozic or jon rolls kii rachanaayen prakashit huin jo vyavahaarwad ke bajaay maanakeey raajnneetik siddhant kii kavayad par aadhaarit thim
 Indian sociology also influenced this trend in the sixties and seventies
 vikasshil samaaj adhyayan peeth ke vidwaanon ne is daur main rajani kothaari ke netritv main bhartiya raajnneeti ko samajhane ke liye vichaardhaaratmak rujhaanon se mukt model banane kaa prayaas kiya
 But it soon became clear that in this model of Kothari, the normative dimensions of sociology have been resorted to for evaluating facts along with the empirical urges
 hindi kaa pad vyavahaarwad samaaj-vigyaan ke do padon, bihavrizam or bihaviralizam, ke liye kaam aata he
 Culture-studies have adopted behaviorism from psychology
 vyavahaarwad kii is kism ke anusaar manovigyaan keval tabhi sachhee vaigyaniktaa kaa vaahak ho saktaa he jab vah apane adhyayan kaa aadhaar vyakti kii mansapeshiy or granthimulak anukriyaaon ko banaaye
 Behavioralism in political science is an influential political theory that opposed values in political studies
 vyavahaarwad kii yah kism raajnneeti ko prakritik vigyaanon ke tarz par samajhnaa chaahati he
 Behavioral scholars saw politics as a system and tried to make it a pure science by emphasizing quantitative analysis rather than qualitative
 rochak baat yah he ki bihavrizam ke prachlan ke peeche bhi america vidwaanon kaa haath tha or bihavieriolizam to raajnneeti-vigyaan par america chhap ke rup main janaa hi jaataa he
 The foundation of both disciplines lay in the early twentieth century

 There is a village in Kadap district under the state of Andhra Pradesh in North Rampur
 sanganak dwaara sanchaar ke kai saadhan ho sakate hai
 Some of these are as follows: - ye saamanytah do prakaar se hota he:- Which includes blogs, bills, electronic mailing lists, internet forums, showboxes and wikis
 isamen nimna aate hai:-data conferencing, google wave, instent miseging, lain miseging, toker, video conferencing, wais chat, voip, web chat, web conferencing According to the census of India, this village is located in Tehsil Kant, District Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh
 sambandhit janaganana code: rajya code :09 jila code :135 tehsil code : 00718 The zygote or crustacea is a major division of arthropod fauna in the fauna, which consists of large crabs, prawns, chingats, pruning, mahachingt, khandavar, wood yucca and water animal, etc
, but to look for its smallest organisms, we have to resort to the microscope
 
 kathini kii bhinn-bhinn jatiyon ke aakar prakaar main bahut hi antar hota he jis kaaran isaki sankshipt paribhaasha dena atyant kathin he
 Every symptom of difficulty, especially in its parasites and highly specialized creatures, changes completely in one way or the other
 crusteshia shabd kaa upyog prarambh main un jeevon ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he jinka kavach kathor tathaa namya ho
 In contrast, other creatures are those whose armor is brittle, such as oysters and snails etc
 parantu ab yah gyaat he ki sab sandhipad jeevon kaa bahi:kankal kathor tathaa namya hota he
 For this reason, difficulty is now isolated from other symptoms
 is varg ke jeev praaia: jalanivaasee hote hai or sansar main koi bhi aisa jalashay nahin he jahaan inaki koi na koi jati na pai jaati ho
 Due to this difficult organisms often breathe through the reservoir or skin
 inamen do jodi shringika jaise avyav mukh ke saamne or teen jodi hanu mukh ke peeche hote hai
 The main familiar organisms of the difficult class are the prawns and crabs that humans use in their food form, but far less economic than these are the organisms Aphipadz, Isopidz, etc
, which act as mamers while living in groups in shallow reservoirs
 We do
 in nimna jeevon kaa bhojan duusare jeev tathaa vanaspatiyon kii tyakt vastuen hai or saath hi yah swayan ucch praaniyon, jaise matsay ityadi, kaa bhojan banate hai
 There are also many talapalvic microbes whose groups change the color of the ocean for miles, so that the fishermen get knowledge of proper fisheries
 is prakaar yah matsay kaa bhojan banakar or saath hi machhuon kii sahaayta karke aarthik laabh pahunchaate hai
 The armor of organisms of this class is divided into groups of segments in the same way as other arthropod organisms, but often some of these segments are also unified
 prayek khand kavach anguthi ke samaan hota he, jo apane agle tathaa pichley khand ke saath namya integument se judaa rahata he
 The dorsal band resembling the arc of each segment is called sternum, and both lateral parts of the tergum, which remain as the bandages, are called plura
 prayek khand ke sternam ke saath ek jodi ang jude rahete hai
 The last segment of the body, which has anus, remains limbless and is called a telson
 aadhunik kathini main koi bhi aisa jeev nahin miltaa jisamen prayek khand ek duusare se spashtatya pruthak ho
 For example, the shell of the body of the prawn body is undivided and oblong and is called carapace
 iske khandon kii sankhya kaa anumaan is bhaag ke saath jude avyavon kii sankhya se lagaaya jaataa he
 The number of combined volumes in this section is considered to be at least six, including the nightly sections
 is bhaag ko sir kehete hai
 When more than this section is included in this part, then the components of the subsequent segments are completely separate from the next elements
 sir ke peeche ke khandon ko sharir ke do bhaagon, vaksh tathaa udar main baanta gaya he, jinako unke vibhinn avyav ek duusare se pruthak karte hai
 But in the high tough malaconstraca etc
, the thoracic segments join the head
 tab is sanyukt bhaag ko shirsovaksh ke naam se abhihit karte hai
 In this way, the form of carapace is also found in many different types of difficult organisms
 yah brankiopoda or austracoda main bivalve kavach ke rup main sharir tathaa angon ko purnataya dhake rahata he, siripedia main yah maansal praavaar ke aakaar kaa hota he or ise pusht karne ke liye calsiumyukt patt bhi sthit rahete hai
 These are some of its special forms, but in the carapace of a simple rectangular form, all the sections of the thorax can be included in the head
 kairapes vibhinn kathiniyon main se praaia: sabhi main paaya jaataa he
 Only Anostraca are organisms that do not have carapace
 kathini ke sharir kii samparivartit charam seemaa iske parashrayi tathaa sthagit jeevon main pai jaati he
 Khandavars remain in their old age with their heads and also have a tendency towards radial symmetry due to their postponed life
 parashrayi jeevon main sharirkhand lupt ho gaye hai or sharir kaa aakaar bhi purna rup se parivartit ho gaya he
 An example of this is rhizocephala, in which the symptoms of difficulty, even the symptoms of arthropods, do not appear in old age
 kathini jeev mukhyat: jalanivaasee hai
 For this reason it is estimated that the body of the ancestor of this class was divided into equal segments and each pair had a pair of limbs attached to it
 inkaa prayek avyav prachlan, bhojanprapti, shwasan tathaa gyanagrahan aadi sab kaary saath-saath karata tha
 a similar system of ingredients has been considered in Trilobita, but this subclass has disappeared
 abhi tak adhunik kathini main kisi bhi aise jeev kaa pataa nahin chalaa jiske avyavon main ye chaaron kaary saath hote hon
 Its head parts are suitable for different special functions, but the components of the torso of Branchiopoda are similar and to some extent can be assumed to have all four functions
 anyathaa angon kii visheshta kathini main kai upayon se unnati kar gai he, kyonki yah vidit he ki jo ang kuch kathiniyon main ek kaary karte hai ve hi kisi duusari kathini main uske vipareet koi anya kaary karte hai
 The development within the difficulty is mainly based on the duty control of these organs
 chaahe kathini ke avyav kisi bhi kaary ke liye upyojit hon or unke aakaar main chaahe kitni vibhinnata kyon na ho, inaki banaavat mukhyat: dwishakhi hoti he
 The base circle of each component is diagonal and is called a sympod or protopodite and two branches endopodite and exopotide arise from its upper segment
 is prakaar ke mul aadhaarit avyav ko steenopodium kehete hai
 Such simple bifacial components are the copulatory posture of the copipod, the abdominal organs of Malacostraca, and similar organs are also found in the progenitor ovum, called noplius
 isi prakaar ke avyav duusare kathini jeevon main vishesh kaaryon ke liye vibhinn rup dhaaran kar lete hai
 There are two types of eyes of difficulty, medium and combined eye
 ati saral madhyam netra nopleius or anek vayask kathiniyon main rahete hai, parantu mailocostraca main ye lupt ho jate hai or inamen sanyukt netra hi kaaryshil netra hote hai
 Combined eyes are often a pair, which are the descendants of some organisms and many are in one
 netravrunt ko sir kaa avyav mana gaya he, parantu yah sandehatmak he
 Because, in growth it emerges much later in other organs
 pratham shringikas, jo mukh ke saamne rahati he, duusare khand ke avyav maani gai hai
 It is unicellular in the genus Noplius and all subcastes, except only Malacostraca
 inkaa mukhya kaary samvedak he, parantu anek dimbhon or vayask kathiniyon main ye plavan ke kaary main bhi aati hai or anek nar shringika se maadaa ko pakadte bhi hai
