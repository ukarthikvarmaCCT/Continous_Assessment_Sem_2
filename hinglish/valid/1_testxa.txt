 The heads of such ashrams were called 'patriarchs'
 ramayana kaal main vashishtha kaa brihad ashram tha jahaan raja dilip tapascharya karne gayi the, jahaan vishwamitra ko brahmatv praapt hua tha
 Another famous ashram of this type was that of Bharadwaja Muni in Prayag
 'gurukul' kaa shabdic arth he 'guru kaa parivaar' athwa 'guru kaa vansh'
 But it has been behaving in the sense of education in India for centuries

 In the development of Indian culture, the beliefs of four Purusharthas, four varnas and four ashrams were interdependent for the accomplishment of their objectives, Gurukul was also a great seeker in their success

 But gifts with such financial rewards and other items were given as Dakshina form only after initiation and before starting the Guru Vidyadan neither the visitor would ask for anything from the students nor did he return any student from his door

 While walking, the disciples would give Dakshina to the Guru according to their power, but the poor students were also freed from it

 The state considered it its duty to make all arrangements for the maintenance of the gurus and gurukuls

 raghuvansh kii is katha main atimanviya put chaahe bhale hon, shikshasmbandhi rajkartavyon kaa yah purnroopen dyotak he
 There are many such discussions in the Pali literature, from which it is known that kings like Prasenjit donated many villages to the Vednishnat Brahmins, who used to run gurukuls for distribution of Vedic education
 yah parampara praaia: adhikansh shaskaon ne aage jari rakhi or dakshin bharat ke brahmanon ko daan main diye gaye graamon main chalane vaale gurukulon or unamem padhai janevaali vidyaon ke anek abhilekhon main varnan milte hai

 There were patriarchs in ancient Indian gurukuls

 In the ancient Indian period, Gurukul used to be the principal center of teaching, where Brahmachari Vidyarthi, or Satyavasi Parivrajakas from far and wide went to complete their teachings
 ve gurukul chote athwa bade sabhi prakaar ke hote the
 But all those gurukuls can neither be called universities in modern terminology nor were all their gurus called patriarchs
 smritivachanon ke anusaar It is clear that the Brahmin sage, who nurtured ten thousand sage students by Annaadi, taught them education, it was called the patriarch
 upar uddhrut 'smritah' shabd ke prayog se yah saaf dikhaai detaa he ki kulapati ke is vishishtarthagrahan kii parampara badi puraani thi
 The patriarch simply meant the lord of a clan
 vah kul yaa to ek chota or avibhakt parivaar ho saktaa tha athwa ek bada or kai chote chote pariwaron kaa samaan udgam vanshakul bhi
 The Antivasi student was a member of the patriarch's great school and the responsibility of his mental and intellectual development rested with the patriarch; He was also concerned about the physical health and happiness of the students

 san 1905 ke banaras adhiveshan main is geet ko saraladevi choudharani ne swar diya
 Apart from congress-conventions, there are many examples of the use of this song during the freedom movement
 lala lajpat raay ne lahore se jis 'jarnal' kaa prakaashan shuru kiya tha uskaa naam vande maataram rakhaa
 "vande Mataram" was the last word on the tongue of Matangini Hazra, a civil libertarian who died as a victim of British bullet
 san 1907 main madam bhikhaji kama ne jab germany ke stutgart main tirangaa fahraaya to uske madhya main "vande maataram" hi likhaa hua tha
 The first song "matri-vandana" was Vande Mataram in the banned book "kranti Geetanjali" of martyr Pt Ram Prasad 'bismil' of Kakori published in 1929 from Arya Printing Press, Lahore and Indian Press, Dehradun, in which he only gave two songs of this song He was given the post and after that, in praise of this song, he gave a vocal Urdu ghazal titled Vande Mataram which was the voice of innumerable unidentified men of that period
 Gives expression to
 british kaal main pratibandhit yah pustak ab susampadit hokar pustakaalayon main uplabdh he
 Despite the decisive participation of this song in the freedom struggle, when it came to the selection of the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, a song written and sung by Rabindranath Thakur, was given preference over Vande Mataram
 isaki vajah yahi thi ki kuch musalamaanon ko "vande maataram" gane par aapatti thi, kyonki is geet main devi durga ko raashtra ke rup main dekha gaya he
 Apart from this, he also believed that the Anand Math novel from which this song was taken was written against Muslims
 in aapattiyon ke maddenjar san 1937 main congress ne is vivaad par gaharaa chintan kiya
 The committee constituted under the chairmanship of Jawaharlal Nehru, including Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, found that the first two verses of the song are said to be in praise of the motherland, but later verses mention Hindu deities; Therefore, it was decided that only the first two verses of this song will be used as national songs
 is tarah gurudev rabindra nath thakur ke jan-gana-man adhinaayak jai he ko yathaavat raashtragan hi rahane diya gaya or mohammad ikbaal ke kaumi taraane saare jahaan se acha ke saath bankimachandra chatarji dwaara rachit praarambhik do padon kaa geet vande maataram raashtragit sweekrut hua
 After achieving independence, Dr
 Rajendra Prasad read a statement in the Constituent Assembly on 24 January 1950 regarding the adoption of 'vande Mataram' as a national anthem
 dow rajendra prasad kaa samvidhan sabha ko diya gaya vaktavy is prakaar he) : There are also some controversies about the Anand Math novel, some staunch people consider it anti-muslim
 unka kahana he ki isamen musalamaanon ko videshi or deshadrohi bataaya gaya he
 The song Vande Mataram is also being debated
 is geet ke pehle do band, jo ki praasangik hai, main koi bhi muslim virdohi baat nahin he or na hi kisi devi yaa durga kii aradhana he
 But these people say that- haalaanki aisa nahin he ki bharat ke sabhi musalamaanon ko is par aapatti he yaa sab hindu ise gane par jor dete hai
 It is also worth mentioning that a few years ago, the famous music composer AR Rahman, himself a Muslim, had prepared a music album about Vande Mataram which became very popular
 adhiktar logon kaa maananaa he ki yah vivaad raajnneetik he
 Can anyone be forced to sing a song or not? This question was raised before the Supreme Court in a suit named Bijoy Emmanuel Versace State of Kerala
 is vaad main kuch vidhyaarthiyon ko skool se isaliye nikaal diya gaya tha kyonki unhone raashtra-gaan jan gana man ko gane se manaa kar diya tha
 These students used to stand in honor of the national anthem at school and respected it but did not sing the song
 gane ke liye unhone manaa kar diya tha
 The Supreme Court accepted his plea and asked the school to withdraw him
 sarvocch nyaayalay kaa kahana tha ki yadi koi vyakti raashtragan kaa sammaan to karata he par use gaata nahin he to iskaa matlab yah nahin ki vah iskaa apmaan kar rahaa he
 Therefore, that person cannot be punished or tortured for not singing it
 chunki vande maataram is desh kaa raashtragit he at: isko jabardastee gane ke liye majaboor karne par bhi yahi kanoon va niyam lagu hoga

 The roots of the belief in vampires in Slavic culture are largely based on the spiritual beliefs and customs of Slavic peoples prior to Christianization and their understanding of life after death

 Examples of such beliefs and customs include ancestor worship, house spirits, and beliefs about the soul after death

 Satan and demons performed important functions in pre-industrial Slavic society and were considered to be mutually influential in human life and their jurisdiction
 kuch pretatmaayen udaar or maanviya kaaryon main madadgaar thim jabaki anya pretatmaayen hanikaarak or aksar vinaashkari ho sakati thim
 Examples of such spirits are Domovoi, Rusalka, Villa, Kikimora, Poludnitsa, and Vodyanoy
 in pretatmaon ko bhi purvajon athwa kisi mrit maanav se vyutpann mana jaataa tha
 Such spirits could appear in different sizes at will, even in different animal and human sizes
 Some of these spirits could be involved in abusive activities to harm humans, such as drowning humans, interrupting crop yields or sucking the blood of cattle and sometimes directly harming humans
 Too
 Therefore, the Slavs were obliged to keep the spirits satisfied and satisfied in order to stop the immense potential of eccentric and destructive behavior
 saadhaaran slav vishwaas aatma or sharir ke bich ek buniyadi antar kii ore ingit karata he
 The soul is not considered mortal
 slav maanate the ki mrityu ke baad aatma sharir se baahar chali jaaegi or anant main paralokagaman se purv apane aas-pados or kaary-sthal main 40 dinon tak bhraman karti rahegi
 is kaaran, ghar ke daravajon or khidakiyon ko khulaa chhod dena aavashyak mana jaataa tha taaki aatma apane avkashanusaar aaraam se avaagaman kar sake
 People believed that at this time the soul has the ability to re-enter the dead body
 pehle bataaye pretatmaon ke saamaan, nikalati hui aatma yaa to aashirwad degi yaa phir aane ke in 40 dinon ke dauraan apane parivaar or padosiyon par kahar dha sakati he
 In order to ensure the purity and peace of his soul at the death of a person, more emphasis was placed on proper funeral rites as this soul was separated from his body
 bina baptism bachche kii maut, hinsak athwa akaal mrityu yaa kisi bhayankar paapi kii maut mrityu ke pashchaat aatma ke ashuddh bane rahane ke ye saare aadharbhoot kaaran ho sakate the
 Even if the body is not properly buried, the soul can become impure

 An unclean spirit was so afraid of the Slavic people because they had the ability to take revenge
 mrityu or aatma se sambandhit in gahari uljhi manyataon ne pishaach kii slav avadharana ko avishkrut karne main yogadan diya
 The vampire is the manifestation of the unclean spirit holding the decaying body
 is bina mare hue praani ko tamsik or jiviton ke prati pratishodhi or irshyaalu samajha jaataa he
 To maintain its physical existence, there is always a need for the blood of the living

 Paul Barber, in his book Vampires, Burial and Death, described that belief in vampires was a result of the natural process of death and decay for people in pre-industrial societies

 The corpses swell as gases fill the torso with decay and the increased pressure forces the blood to leak from the mouth and nose
 isi kaaran sharir "gol matol", "acha khaaya piya" or "raktabh" dikhta he -- ye parivartan or bhi adhik ascharyajanak hote the agar vah vyakti apane jivan-kaal main pilaa murajhaayaa hua yaa patala rahaa
 In the case of Arnold Pavol, the body of an old woman dug up from the tomb was described by her neighbors as more chubby and healthy than she had ever been in her life
 The leaking blood created the impression that the corpse was currently busy with vampiric activities
 twachaa kaa kaala padana bhi sadan ke kaaran utpann hua tha
 Flooding will cause bleeding from the body due to stinging of peg in the body and the gases in the body will be forced to come out
 This can produce a groan-like sound when the gases pass through the vocal cords or the remaining ventral air exits through the anus
 peter plogojovitz ke maamle kii aadhikarik report "duusare prachand lakshan jinhen main puure sammaan ke saath samarthan detaa hum" ke bare main charchaa karti he
 After death, fluid from the skin and gums begin to shrink and they begin to shrink
 isse jabade ke saath jakadi hui baalo, nakhunon or daanton kii jaden dikhaai dene lagati hai
 This can lead to the illusion that hair, nails and teeth have been born
 ek nishchit avasthaa main pahunchakar nakhun gir jate hai or twachaa chhilake kii tarah alag ho jaati he, jaisaa ki plogojovitz ke maamle main report main kaha gaya he -- chamadiyaan or nakhunon kii bhitari paraten jo baahar nikal aati hai unhen "nayi twachaa" or "nae nakhun" maan liye jate hai
 It has also been speculated that vampire folklore was influenced by people who were buried alive due to primitive medical knowledge
 kuch maamalon main jisamen logon ne kisi khaas taabut se awaz baahar nikalne kii soochna di, jise baad main khodakar baahar nikaalane par anguliyon ke nakhunon ke nishaan adanr kii ore paae gaye jisase yah jaahir ho rahaa tha ki shikaar bachakar bhaagane kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 In other cases people used to hit their heads, noses or faces and it was evident that they were "feeding"

 An alternative explanation of the sound coming out is the sound of gushing from the distraction of gases due to the natural decomposition of bodies
 avyavasthit evam vikrut makbare ke peeche aisa hi ek or kaaran he, makbare ko lootnaa
 Folkloric vampirism has been linked to sequential deaths from hijackable or mysterious illnesses that often occur in the same family or in the same small community

 Noting that this condition is treated with intravenous blood, he suggested that the intake of large amounts of blood would lead to an increase in blood which would somehow be transported across the abdominal walls into the bloodstream
 Thus the vampires were only suffering from porphyria disease which wanted to reduce the symptoms of their disease by changing blood
 is siddhant ko chikitsa shaastra kii drushti se nakaar diya gaya
 These were based on misconceptions about the disease as a suggestion that sufferers of porphyria disease crave for blood or that consumption of blood may relieve symptoms of porphyria
 isse atirikt, yah dekha gaya ki dolphin kaalpanik pishaachon ko bhul se lokkatha ke pishaachon ke rup main samaj liya tha, jinamein se adhiktar ko unhone paaya ki ve khun nahin pite

 In any case, the dolphins did not move towards widespread publicity of their work
 Despite being rejected by experts, the episode garnered media attention and became a popular modern folk tale
 jalantic ko pashachik lokkatha se joda gaya he
 a neurologist, Dr
 Juan gómez-alonso, at the Zarel Hospital in Vigo, Spain, investigated this possibility in a neuroscience report
 lahasun or roshni ke prati grahanshiltaa ati samvedansheeltaa ke kaaran ho sakati thi, jo jalantic rog kaa hi ek lakshan he
 The disease can also affect parts of the brain, causing disturbances and hypersensitivity to normal sleep patterns
 lokkatha ke anusaar agar koi apana prativimb dekh saktaa he to vah unmatta yaa pagal nahin he 
 bhediye or chamagadad jinhen aksar pishaachon se joda jaataa he, ve jalantic ke vaahak ho sakate hai
 This disease can motivate others to bite through the teeth and can also inflict bloody froth on the mouth
 san 1931 main duswapn par apane prabandh lekh on da nikhmer main welsh ke manovishleshak ernest jones ne yah ullekh kiya ki pishaach anek avchetan prabal preranaon or rakshaatmak pratikriyaaon ke pratik maatr hai
 Love, guilt and hatred are his feelings that fuel the idea of the deceased returning to his grave
 apane priy janon se punarmilan kii kaamana se shok santapt log yah vichaar poshan karte the ki haal main mritak kii bhi aisi hi dharna honi chahie
 This led to the belief that folkloric vampires and ghosts come to visit their relatives, especially their spouses
 However, in some cases where subconscious guilt was associated with the relationship, the desire for reunion was distorted by anxiety
 isse daman kaa janm ho saktaa he jise froid ne vikrut rogajanya ke vikaas ke saath joda tha
 Jones speculated in this case that the original desire for reunion might change drastically: fear replaces desire, sadism replaces love, and an object or loved one takes some unknown power

 Subsequent screenplays featured many variations, some of which focused on vampire hunters such as Blade in the Marvel Comics "blade" films and Buffy the Vampire Slayer
 Buffy, released in 1992, revealed the vampiric character's predecessor on TV with Angel, an extended version of a long-running hit TV series of the same name

 As a result of this increased interest in fiendish screenplays, the vampire character has been introduced in many films such as Underworld and Van Helsing, Russian Night Watch and the TV short series adaptation of Salem's lot, both from 2004
 The series premiere of Blood Ties occurred on Lifetime Television in 2007, featuring the character Henry Fitzroy as the illegitimate son of Henry viii's vampire son in England in modern-day Toronto with a former Toronto female detective

 Even in 1947, India formed the United Nations Palestine Salt Organization, but in 1989 the dispute in Kashmir and the fall of Soviet Union and illegal infiltration of Pakistan changed the political environment and India changed its mindset with relations with Israel
 The emphasis was on strengthening and in 1992 a new era began

 breadman bachapan se hi ballebaaji karne kaa abhyaas karte rahete the
 After this, he himself founded Solo Cricket, in which cricket stumps bat and golf ball are used
 inhone bachapan main bahut cricket khelaa tha or pehla shatak jab 12 saal ke the tab banaaya tha us match main inhone 125 ranon kii pari kheli thi or vah match bovara public skool ke liye khelte hue mitagong hai skool ke saamne khelaa gaya tha l Don Bradman made his Test cricket debut on 30 November 1928 against the England team and played his last Test match against England on 18 August 1948

 modi bharat main ek upnaam hai
 It is commonly found in the north and west Indian states of Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar, Jharkhand and Gujarat
 modi adhiktar baniyaa jati se sambandhit hai
 The common meaning of 'modi' is the seller of pulses, rice, grocer, grocer, grocer
 Bhandari or store-keeper can also be called Modi
 or ‘modikhana’ kaa arth he modi kii dukaan yaa bhandar, pansaari kii dukaan, general store, rashan kii dukaan, kiraanaa store, rasad bhandar, aapurti bhandar
 narendra modi gujarat ke modh-ghanchi samaaj se hai jo paramparaagat rup se vanaspati tel nikaalane or bechney kaa kaam karata rahaa he
 It is a historical fact that in India, family businesses were transformed into castes due to their being engaged in the same business from generation to generation
 aisa prathit hota he ki modi jati kaa namakaran pracheen kaal main moth bechney ke vyavsaay se shuru hua hoga 
 In the world about 10,000 years ago, when our bhil-shikari-nomad people wanted to leave the forests and settle for the first village of human civilization
 kand-mul-fal kaa sangrah or shikaar chhod kar hamaare purakhe krishi karnaa chaah rahe the, kintu unhen ab bhi van main upji vasteen hi khaane ke liye pasand thim
 In such a situation, some people brought the forest produce from the forest and sold it to the people of the village or transacted it
 van-upaj bechney yaa uskaa len-dein karne vaale hi vanaki / vaniye / baniye kehalaae honge 
 In these dynasties, various people must have started specializing in bringing items from the forest
 isi vastu-vishesh main visheshgyata ke kaaran baniyaa jati kii up-jatiyaan bani hongi, jaise bans vaala baansal / bansal, madhu vaala madhukul / mudgal
 Vinay Mothi, who sell or deal with Moth from the forest, will be called Mothi and then Mothi and Modi from Mothi
 pracheen kaal main jab hamaare purakhe nae-nae khaadya padaarthon kii pahchaan or unka namakaran kar rahe the, unhone kand-mul-fal-ann kaa naamkaaran unke swaad, aakaar yaa anya gunon par kiya hoga
 Like Madhur> Matur> Peas
 isi kram jab moth ke paudhe kii khoj hui to purakhon ne paaya ki yah mithi fali manushyon ko bhi pasand he or pashuon ko bha
 Due to the sweetness, it got its name - Mishtha> Moshka> Moshkaq> Mukhushta> Moshkaq> Mothikea> Modike
 Moshth> Moth> Mut / Math
 moth ko bina pakaaye khaaya ja saktaa he kyonki pani main bhigane ke kuch hi der main moth naram or ankurit ho jaataa he
 Therefore, this plant of Indian origin must have been one of the first grains / pulses used in human history
 is prakaar moth kaa naam moth kyon padaa
 Some scholars believe that the word Modi is derived from Modak, hence Modi was a confectioner
 kintu aisa lagata he ki sansar kaa pehla modak banane ke liye moshthak yaa moth kaa prayog kiya gaya hoga
 Hence Modak to Moth
 This imagination is based on the quality of moth that one can eat it without cooking it
 kachi bhigi moth main koi meetha ras mila kar sansar kaa pehla modak bana hoga
 Today not only of moth but modak of moong, urad and gram are very popular
 at: moth se modi, moth se modak; modak se modi nahin
 Among all the castes, only Bani or Modi used to keep accounts of their transactions in books, in these books, accounts of transactions from other Modis were written in different columns
 prayek modi kaa ek alag kollam hota tha
 From here, the column of the table would have been called the item or the Madd

 landau-ramanujan stambhakaramanujan-soldanar Stambhakaramanujan Theta funljarors-ramanujan Tasamkaramanujan Projacutra Theta Functions shrinivas ramanujan iyangar ek mahaan bhartiya ganitagya the
 He is counted among the greatest mathematics thinkers of the modern period
 inhen ganit main koi vishesh prashikshan nahin mila, phir bhi inhone vishleshan evam sankhya siddhant ke kshetron main gahan yogadan die
 With his talent and dedication, he not only made amazing innovations in the field of Mathematics but also gave India an incomparable pride
 ye bachapan se hi vilakshan pratibhavan the
 He learned mathematics by himself and compiled 3,884 theorems of mathematics throughout his life
 inamen se adhikansh prameya sahi siddh kiye ja chuke hai
 He drew many fundamental and unconventional results on the strength of the intuitive knowledge of mathematics and the unique talent of algebraic hypothesis, which inspired research to date, although some of his discoveries have not yet been adopted into the mathematics mainstream
 haal main inke sutron ko crystal-vigyaan main prayukt kiya gaya he
 Ramanujan Journal has been established for the work being done in the areas of mathematics affected by his work
 ramanujan kaa janm 22 disambar1887 ko bharat ke dakshini bhubhag main sthit coimbatore ke erod naamake gaanv main hua tha
 He was born in a traditional Brahmin family
 inaki kii mata kaa naam komaltammal or inke pita kaa naam shrinivas ayyangar tha
 His childhood was spent mainly in Kumbakonam, which is known for its ancient temples
 bachapan main ramanujan kaa bauddhik vikaas saamaanya baalkon jaisaa nahin tha
 He did not even learn to speak until he was three years old
 jab itani badi aayu tak jab ramanujan ne bolnaa aarambh nahin kiya to sabko chintaa hui ki kahin yah gunge to nahin hai
 In later years, when he entered school, he never felt in traditional education
 ramanujan ne das varshon kii aayu main primary pariksha main puure jile main sabase adhik ank praapt kiya or aage kii shiksha ke liye toun hiskool pahunche
 Ramanujan loved asking questions
 unke prashn adhyapakon ko kabhi-kabhi bahut atapate lagate the
 Like - who was the first man in the world? What is the distance between earth and clouds? Ramanujan's behavior was very sweet
 inkaa saamaanya se kuch adhik sthool sharir or jigyaasa se chamakati aakhen inhen ek alag hi pahchaan detii thim
 According to their classmates, their behavior was so gentle that no one could get angry with them
 vidhyalay main inaki pratibha ne duusare vidhyaarthiyon or shikshakon par chhap chhodana aarambh kar diya
 He had studied college level mathematics during his school time
 ek baar inke vidhyalay ke pradhanadhyaapak ne yah bhi kaha tha ki vidhyalay main hone vaali parikshaon ke maapdand ramanujan ke liye lagu nahin hote hai
 After passing the high school examination, he received a Subramanian scholarship for scoring good marks in Mathematics and English and also got admission for further college education
 aage ek pareshaani ai
 Ramanujan's love for mathematics had grown so much that he did not pay attention to other subjects
 yahaan tak kii ve itihaas, jeev vigyaan kii kakshaon main bhi ganit ke prashnon ko hal kiya karte the
 As a result, in the eleventh grade examination, he failed in all subjects except mathematics and as a result he stopped getting scholarship
 ek to ghar kii aarthik sthiti kharaab or upar se chaatravrutti bhi nahin mil rahi thi
 This was a very difficult time for Ramanujan
 ghar kii sthiti sudhaarney ke liye inhone ganit ke kuch tution tathaa khate-bahi kaa kaam bhi kiya
 Sometime later in 1907 Ramanujan again took the private examination of class XII and failed
 or isi ke saath inke paaramparik shiksha kii itishree ho gai
 The five years after leaving school were very frustrating for him
 bharat is samay paratantraa kii bediyon main jakadaaa tha
 There was severe poverty everywhere
 aise samay main ramanujan ke paas na koi naukari thi or na hi kisi santhaan athwa professor ke saath kaam karne kaa mauka
 His unwavering faith in God and deep reverence for mathematics always inspired him to follow the path of duty
 namgiri devi ramanujan ke parivaar kii isht devi thim
 Unwavering faith in him did not let him stay anywhere and he continued to conduct his research of mathematics even under such adverse circumstances
 is samay ramanujan ko tution se kul paanch rupaye masik milte the or isi main guzaara hota tha
 This life span of Ramanujan was full of grief and sorrow
 inhen hameshaa apane bharan-poshan ke liye or apni shiksha ko jari rakhane ke liye idhar udhar bhatakana padaa or anek logon se asafal yachana bhi kerani padi
 In the year 1908, his parents married him to a girl named Janaki
 vivaah ho jane ke baad ab inke liye sab kuch bhul kar ganit main doobana sambhav nahin tha
 Hence, he came to Madras in search of a job
 barahavin kii pariksha uteern na hone kii vajah se inhen naukari nahin mili or unka swasthya bhi buree tarah gir gaya
 Now on the advice of the doctor, he had to return to his home in Kumbakonam
 beemaari se thik hone ke baad ve waapas madras aae or phir se naukari kii talash shuru kar di
 Whenever he met someone, he used to show him a register of his own
 is register main inke dwaara ganit main kiye gaye saare kaary hote the
 At the same time, at the behest of someone, Ramanujan met Mr
 V
 Ramaswamy Iyer, the deputy collector there
 ayyar ganit ke bahut bade vidwaan the
 Here, Mr
 Iyer recognized the talent of Ramanujan and after asking District Magistrate Mr
 Ramchandra Rao, he also arranged a monthly scholarship of Rs
 25 for him
 is vritti par ramanujan ne madras main ek saal rahete hue apana pratham shodhpatr prakashit kiya
 The title of the research paper was "some properties of Bernoulli numbers" and this research paper was published in Journal of Indian Mathematical Society
 yahaan ek saal puraa hone par inhone madras port trust main clerk kii naukari kii
 Fortunately, there was not much work load in this job and here they used to get enough time for their mathematics
 yahaan par ramanujan raat bhar jaag kar nae-nae ganit ke sutara likhaa karte the or phir thodi der tak aaraam kar ke phir daftar ke liye nikal jate the
 Ramanujan used to write mathematics research on slate
 or baad main use ek register main likh lete the
 At night the sleep of other members of the family was disturbed due to the sound of Ramanujan's slate and pillar
 is samay bhartiya or pashchimi rahan sahan main ek badi duuri thi or is vajah se saamanytah bharatiyon ko angrej vaigyanikon ke saamne apane baton ko prastut karne main kaaphi sankoch hota tha
 The situation here was such that research work could not be carried forward without the help of an English mathematician
 is samay ramanujan ke puraane shubhachintak inke kaam aae or in logon ne ramanujan dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon ko landan ke prasiddh ganitagyon ke paas bheja
 But here they did not get any special help but one benefit was that people had come to know Ramanujan a little bit
 isi samay ramanujan ne apane sankhya siddhant ke kuch sutara professor sheshu ayyar ko dikhaae to unka dhyaan landan ke hi professor hardi kii taraf gaya
 Professor Hardy was one of the world's famous mathematicians of the time
 or apane sakht swabhaav or anushaasan priyata ke kaaran jane jate the
 After reading Professor Hardy's research work, Ramanujan said that he has found the answer to the unanswered question of Professor Hardy
 ab ramanujan kaa professor hardi se patravyavhaar aarambh hua
 From here on, a new era in Ramanujan's life began in which Professor Hardy had a very big role
 duusare shabdon main kaha jaae to jis tarah se ek johari heere kii pahchaan karata he or use taraash kar chamakaa detaa he, ramanujan ke jivan main vaisaa hi kuch sthaan professor hardi kaa he
 Professor Hardy was an admirer of Ramanujan's life and philosophy of life
 ramanujan or professor hardi kii yah mitrataa dono hi ke liye laabhprad siddh hui
 In a way, both of them worked complementary to each other
 professor hardi ne us samay ke vibhinn pratibhashali vyaktiyon ko 100 ke paimaane par aanka tha
 He gave 35 marks to most mathematicians and 60 marks to some specific persons
 lekin unhone ramanujan ko 100 main puure 100 ank die the
 Initially, when Ramanujan sent his research work to Professor Hardy, at first he did not even understand
 jab unhone apane mitra ganitagyon se salaah lee to ve is nishkarsh par pahunche ki ramanujan ganit ke kshetra main ek durlabh vyaktitv he or inke dwaara kiye gaye kaary ko thik se samajhane or usamen aage shodh ke liye unhen england aana chahie
 So he invited Ramanujan to come to Cambridge
 kuch vyaktigat kaarnon or dhan kii kami ke kaaran ramanujan ne professor hardi ke cambridge ke aamantran ko asweekaar kar diya
 Professor Hardy was disappointed by this but somehow decided to call Ramanujan there
 isi samay ramanujan ko madras vishvavidhyalay main shodh vritti mil gai thi jisase unka jivan kuch saral ho gaya or unako shodhakarya ke liye puraa samay bhi milane laga tha
 Meanwhile, after a long correspondence, slowly, Professor Hardy agreed Ramanujan to come to Cambridge
 professor hardi ke prayaason se ramanujan ko cambridge jane ke liye aarthik sahaayta bhi mil gai
 Ramanujan had written over 3000 new sources of mathematics in his notebook before leaving for England
 ramanujan ne landan kii dharti par kadam rakhaa
 Professor Hardy had already arranged for him there, so he did not face any particular problem
 england main ramanujan ko bas thodi pareshaani thi or iskaa kaaran tha unka sharmila, shant swabhaav or shuddh satvik jeevancharya
 Throughout his stay in England, he mostly cooked his own food
 england kii is yatra se unke jivan main krantikari parivartan aayaa
 He, along with Professor Hardy, published high-quality research papers
 apane ek vishesh shodh ke kaaran inhen cambridge vishvavidhyalay dwaara bi
e
 kii oopaadhi bhi mili
 But the climate and living style there was not very favorable to him and his health started deteriorating
 doctoron ne ise kshay rog bataaya
 At that time there was no tuberculosis medicine and the patient had to stay in the sanatorium
 ramanujan ko bhi kuch dinon tak vahaan rahanaa padaa
 Even at this time, he used to make new imaginations in the mathematical formulas
 iske baad vahaan ramanujan ko royal socity kaa phelo namit kiya gaya
 At a time when India was living in slavery, it was a great thing for a black person to get membership of the Royal Society
 royal socity ke puure itihaas main inase kam aayu kaa koi sadsy aaj tak nahin hua he
 His well-wishers celebrated and held gatherings all over India
 royal socity kii sadsyta ke baad yah triniti college kii fellowship paane vaale pehle bhartiya bhi bane
 Now it seemed that everything was going to a very good place
 lekin ramanujan kaa swasthya girtaa ja rahaa tha or ant main doctoron kii salaah par unhen waapas bharat lautnaa padaa
 On coming to India, he got a professor job at Madras University
 or ramanujan adhyaapan or shodh kaary main punah ram gaye
 Even after returning to India, health did not support them and the condition was getting serious
 is beemaari kii dasha main bhi inhone mock theta function par ek ucch stareey shodhpatr likhaa
 This function, propounded by Ramanujan, is used not only in mathematics but also in medical science to understand cancer
 inkaa girtaa swasthya sabake liye chintaa kaa vishay ban gaya or yahaan tak kii ab doctoron ne bhijawab de diya tha
 Finally, the moment of Ramanujan's departure arrived
 26 april1920 ke praatah kaal main ve achet ho gaye or dopaher hote hote unhone praan tyaag die
 At this time Ramanujan's age was only 33 years
 inkaa asamay nidhan ganit jagat ke liye apurnty kshati tha
 Whoever heard the news of Ramanujan's death in the whole country and abroad was shocked
 ramanujan or inke dwaara kiye gaye adhikansh kaary abhi bhi vaigyanikon ke liye abujh paheli bane hue hai
 In his journey to surprise the whole world by taking birth in a very common family, he gave India unprecedented glory
 inkaa unka vah purana register jis par ve apane prameya or sutron ko likhaa karte the 1976 main achaanak triniti college ke pustkaalay main mila
 This register of about one hundred pages remains a puzzle for scientists even today
 is register ko baad main ramanujan kii note book ke naam se janaa gaya
 It has also been published by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai
 ramanujan ke shodhon kii tarah unke ganit main kaam karne kii style bhi vicitra thi
 He sometimes woke up in the middle of the night by writing mathematics formulas on the slate and then falling asleep
 is tarah aisa lagata tha ki ve sapane main bhi ganit ke prashn hal kar rahe hon
 Along with Ramanujan's name, his Kuldevi is also taken
 inhone shunya or anant ko hameshaa dhyaan main rakhaa or iske antarsambandhon ko samajhane ke liye ganit ke sutron kaa sahaara liya
 There was a specialty of Ramanujan's work
 pehle ve ganit kaa koi nayaa sutara yaa prameny pehle likh dete the lekin uski upapatti par utana dhyaan nahin dete the
 When asked about this, he used to say that he received this sutra by the grace of Namagiri Devi
 ramanujan kaa aadhyatm ke prati vishwaas itnaa gaharaa tha ki ve apane ganit ke kshetra main kiye gaye kisi bhi kaary ko aadhyatm kaa hi ek ang maanate the
 He not only believed in religion and spirituality but also presented it logically
 ve kehete the ki "mere liye ganit ke us sutara kaa koi matlab nahin he jisase mujhe aadhyatmik vichaar na milte hon
 " ramanujan ne england main paanch varshon tak mukhyatah sankhya siddhanth ke kshetra main kaam kiya
 Ramanujan gave the following formula - is sutara kii visheshta yah he ki yah ganit ke do sabase prasiddh niyatankon kaa sambandh ek anant satat bhinn ke madhyam se vyakt karata he
 He also gave another formula for pie - 'ramanujan sankhya' us prakritik sankhya ko kehete hai jise do alag-alag prakaar se do sankhyaon ke ghanon ke yoga dwaara nirupit kiya ja saktaa he
 Example - 9 3 + 10 3 = 1 3 + 12 3 = 1729 { \ displaystyle 9 ^ {3} + 10 ^ {3} = 1 ^ {3} + 12 ^ {3} = 1729}
 isi prakaar, Hence Ramanujan numbers are 1729, 4104, 20683, 39312, 40033 etc

 a mixed economy is an economy that is a mix of different markets and economic schemes, in which the private sector and the state direct the economy; Or an economy that combines public ownership and private ownership; Or mix of economic interventionism with free markets
 adhikansh mishrit arthvyavastha market arthvyavastha hai jo prabal viniamak nirikshan evam saarvajanik vastuon kaa sarkari praavdhaan ke aadhaar par chalate hai
 In general, mixed economy is characterized by private ownership of the means of production, dominance of markets for economic coordination, profit-making enterprises and accumulation of capital are the most important driving forces of economic activity
 lekin ek mukt bazaar arthvyavastha ke vipareet, sarkaar samaaj kalyaan ko badhaava dene kii hastkshep karne main ek bhoomika nibhaa rahaa he ke saath saath aarthik vivashtaa or vittiya sankat or berogari kii ore poonjeevaad kii pravriti pratikriya karne ke liye dizine kiya gaya rajkoshiya or maudrik nitiyon ke madhyam se arthvyavastha par apratyaksh vyapak aarthik prabhaav bhi kar rahaa he
 As an economic ideal, various political parties such as mixed economies such as the Social Democrats or the Christian Democrats
 aam taur par centre-left or centre-rhit ke logon ke dwaara samarthit hai
 Proponents perceive mixed economies as a compromise between state socialism and free markets, which also have a better effect
 kai arthshaastriyon ne mishrit arthvyavastha kii sankalpana ke vaidhata ko prashn kiya he jab use samaajwaad or poonjeevaad kaa mishran kaha jaataa he
 In his famous work Human Action, Ladwig von Mises had argued that there can never be a mixture of socialism and capitalism — either market logic or economic planning should dominate an economy
 misses ne vistrut kiya ki ek poonjivadi market arthvyavastha kai rajya ran yaa rashtriyakrut udhyamon se nihit he, bhale hi us pradarshan se is baat par savistaar, ek arthvyavastha ko "mishrit " nahin bana saktaa he
 The existence of such organizations cannot change the fundamental characteristics of a market economy
 ye saarvajanik udhyamon abhi bhi bazaar me swaamitv samprabhutaa ke adheen hoga, , bazaar ke madhyam se puunji asabaab praapt karne ke liye laabh ko adhiktam karne kaa prayaas kiya he, or aarthik gananaa ke liye maudrik lekhankan kaa upyog kiya he
 Marxist theorists also dispute the feasibility of a mixed economy as a "middle ground" between socialism and capitalism
 is pariprekshya main, chaahe udhyam swaamitv ho, yaa to mulya or puunji kaa sanchay kii poonjivadi vyavastha se arthvyavastha ko chalaata he yaa conshius yojana or moolyankan kii gaiyr- maudrik roopon antat arthvyavastha ko chalaata he
 They therefore operate on the basis of capital accumulation because the "mixed economies" prevalent in the Western world, post-great Depression, are still functional capitalists
