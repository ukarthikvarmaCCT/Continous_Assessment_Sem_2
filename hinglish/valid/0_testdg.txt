 The force acting towards the center of the path in the perpendicular direction of the instantaneous velocity of a body is called the centripetal force
 abhikendra bal ke kaaran pind vakr-path par gati karti he 
 For example, concentric force is the cause of circular motion
 a = − v 2 r = − v 2 r u ^ r = − ω 2 r { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {a} =-{ \ frac {v^{2}}{r}} \ left=-{ \ frac {v^{2}}{r}}{ \ hat { \ mathbf {u} }}_{r}=- \ omega ^{2} \ mathbf {r} } Where: newton ke gati ke dwitiya niyam ke anusaar yadi kahin koi twaran he to twaran kii disha main bal avashya lag rahaa hoga
 Therefore, if the particle of mass m is moving in a uniform circular motion, the value of the centripetal force acting on it will be given by the following formula: f = − m v 2 r u ^ r = − m ω 2 r { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {F} =-{ \ frac {mv^{2}}{r}}{ \ hat { \ mathbf {u} }}_{r}=-m \ omega ^{2} \ mathbf {r} } Chungthang is a sub-division of North Sikkim district in the state of Sikkim

 naatak kii prishtabhumi patliputra he
 According to Bharata, it is the best example of 'mishra Case' out of ten forms
 ‘mrichhakaticum’ naatak iskaa pramaan he ki antim aadmi ko sahitya main jagah dene kii parampara bharat ko viraasat main mili he jahaan chor, ganika, garib brahman, daasi, nai jaise log dusht raja kii satta palat kar ganraajya sthapit kar antim aadmi se naayakatv ko praapt hote hai

 vah itnaa bada nagar he ki patliputra kaa samvahak uski prasiddhi sunakar basane ko, dhandha praapt karne ko, aata he
 We find a society of Chaturvarnya in it - Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras
 brahmanon kaa mukhya kaam purohitai tha, par ve rajkaaj main bhi dilchaspee lete the
 a very serious thing which is found in this story is that here Brahmins, merchants and inferior people together overthrow the Madanand Kshatriya kingdom
 yah dhyaan dene yogya baat he
 And then it is a matter of thinking that the author of this story is considered to be King Shudraka, who is said to be superior among the Kshatriyas

 isi ke saath aryak kii rajyaprapti kii raajnneetik katha bhi gunthi hui he
 Kritikar has skillfully combined the two stories
 yah naatak mote taur par do hisson main hai- pehla, vasantsena or charudatt kaa prem-prasang tathaa doosraa, rajya vidroh ke saath aryak ko rajpad kii prapti
 First issue: There is a story in this issue that the king's brother-in-law wants to get Vasantasena, the famous courtesan of Ujjayini
 apane do saathiyon ke saath ek andheri raat main vah vasantsena kaa peechha karata he
 The terrified Vasantasena takes Sharan at Charudatta's house
 choron se bachane kii baat kahkar vah apane saare swarna-aabhushan charudatt ke ghar main dharohar ke rup main chhod detii he
 Number two: The conductor, who was previously in the service of Charudatta, loses a lot of money due to gambling addiction
 bachaav ke liye vah vasantsena ke ghar shaaran letaa he, jo apana kangan dekar use rinmukt karti he
 He becomes a Buddhist-monk
 teesraa ank : sharvilak naam kaa brahman vasantsena kii daasi madnika se prem karata he
 To free him from slavery, he breaks into Charudatta's house one night and steals all the gold jewelery kept by Vasantasena
 udhar charudatt kii pativrata patni dhoota apane pati ko lokaninda se bachaane ke liye, churaae gaye aabhushaanon ke badale main apni keemtee ratnavali detii he, charudatt vah ratnavali dekar vidooshak maitrey ko vasantsena ke ghar bhejtaa he
 Fourth issue: Sharvilak arrives at Vasantasena's house to take Madanika free from slavery by taking stolen stolen clothes
 chori kii baat sunakar madnika bahut dukhi hoti he
 In the spirit of correcting this mistake, she convinces Sharvilak that by handing over stolen robes to Vasantasena, he will not remain a thief, nor will there be a loan on the head of Charudutt and he will get Vasantasena's jewelery back, Sharvilak does so
 vah vasantsena se kahata he ki charudatt ne yah sandesh bheja he ki ghar jarjar hone se ham swarnapaatr ko surakshit nahin rakh sakate, atah aap ise apane paas rakhen
 Vasantasena hands Madanika to Sharvilak, asking him to take something in exchange for the message
 isi ank main vidooshak vasantsena se milakar kahata he ki swarnapaatr jue main haar gaye hai isliye yah ratnavali sweekaar karen
 Vasantasena knows the reality, but does nothing
 vah shaam ko charudatt ke ghar aane kaa nishchay karti he
 Fifth issue: This season describes the rainy season
 vasantsena charudatt se milti he or varsha kii jhadi ke kaaran raat usee ke ghar ruk jaati he
 Sixth Point: In the morning, Charudatta goes for a walk in Pushparkandak garden, with the promise of keeping the car ready for Vasantasena so that he can travel to the park there
 yaheen vasantsena charudatt ke putr rohsen ko yah jid karte dekhati he ki vah mitti kii gaadi se nahin swarna-shakatic se khelnaa chahta he
 Vasantasena puts all the clothes in a clay cart and says that to make a gold car from it
 vasantsena charudatt se udyaan main bhent karne nikalati he, par bhul se usee sthaan par khadi shaakaar kii gaadi main baith jaati he
 Meanwhile, Gawale's son Aryak, who breaks the prison and runs out after killing the guard, gets into Chaudutt's vehicle for rescue
 raste main do police ke sipaahi- virak or chandanak vaahan dekhte bhi hai, par unamem se ek aryak ko raksha karne kaa vachan dekar jane detaa he
 Seventh issue: Aryak named Aryak, who believed that King Palak believed in the prophecy of the Siddhas, was imprisoned when he broke the bond and climbed into the car of Charudatta and came in front of Chaudatta in the garden and asked for his protection
 charudatt use surakshit apni gaadi main baahar nikalava detaa he
 Eighth issue: When Vasantasena, who was sitting in a carriage of Shakara by mistake, reaches the garden, he is confronted by the evil Shakar in place of Charudatta
 vasantsena ek baar phir shaakaar ke changul main fas jaati he, shaakaar kaa aagrah na maanane par vah vasantsena kaa galaa ghont detaa he or use mara jaanakar patton se dhak kar chalaa jaataa he
 That is why the conductor, who has become a Buddhist-monk from the gambler, brings life back to Vasantasena, the deceased
 navaan ank : shaakaar charudatt ko vasantsena kii hatya kaa aaropee banaata he
 Controversy goes on in court, Charudatta is unable to prove himself innocent
 dukhi charudatt apane mitra maitrey kii pratiksha karata he, jo vasantsena ke paas un aabhushanon ko lautaane gaya tha jo vasantsena ne rohsen kii mitti kii gaadi ke sthaan par sone kii gaadi bana lene ko de die the
 Maitreya arrives at the same moment with the same ornament
 kintu baatcheet karte hue maitrey se bagal main sanbhale hue ve aabhushan sabake saamne gir padate hai or yah maan liya jaataa he ki aabhushanon ke lobh main charudatt ne hi vasantsena kii hatya kii he
 He is ordered to death and taken to the slaughter
 dasavaan ank : is ank main ek to shaakaar kaa sevak sthvarak charudatt ko nirdosh bataata he, par uskaa koi vishwaas nahin karata
 At the same time, Vasantasena expresses the wickedness of Shakara by coming with a vampire who has become a Buddhist-monk who saves his life and Charudatta is freed from false accusation
 idhar rajya main nae raja aryak kaa aagaman hota he, vah na keval aarope mukt charudatt ko rajya detaa he, balki jhootha aarope lagane ke kaaran shaakaar ko mrityu-dand bhi detaa he
 But Shakar is also forgiven at the behest of Charudatta
 pativrata dhoota charudatt ke liye mrityu-dand kaa samachar sunakar agni-pravesh ko tatpar ho uthati he, charudatt upasthit hokar is dukhad ghatana ko roktaa he
 King Aryak pleases Vasantasena with the title of 'bride'
 bhikshu samvahak ko sab viharon kaa kulapati bana diya jaataa he
 The slave settler is freed from slavery, the chanters who give death penalty are made the chief of the chandalas, even the shakara is given the tribute
 in sukhad ghatnaon ke saath naatak samaapt hota he
 Not only is the story of Mruthaktik very interesting, but the character of the poet's characterization is very high
 yadhyapi isamen pradhan ras vipralambh shringaar he tathaapi hasya, karuna, bhayanak evam vatsalya jaise hridayahari vividh rason kaa sahaj saamanjasy he
 Its value has also been judged very much by Western mystics when tested from the point of view of Greek theater
 isaki bhashaa prasad gun se sampann ho atyant pranjal he
 The philosophy of the various forms of Prakrit is seen in it- In addition to Oriya, Magadhi and Shaurseni, the best examples of Prakrit Maharashtri and Avanti are available here
 grearsan ke anusaar is prakaran main shaakaari vibhaasha main takki praakrit kaa bhi prayog paaya jaataa he
 The poet has given special attention to Madhuri and Arthayavakthi in Shabchayan, due to which the Avanti and Vaidarbhi customs have been completely fulfilled

 This drama holds its special place in Sanskrit literature
 isamen– These are its characteristics
 is naatak kii raajnneetik visheshta yah he ki isamen kshatriya raja bura bataaya gaya he
 gop-putra 'aryak' is a cowherd, whom the poet makes a king
 yadhyapi kavi varnashram ko maanata he, par vah gop ko hi raja banaata he
 It seems that this story is old and possibly this incident is some real event which has remained in the legend
 daspratha ke ladkadhaate samaaj kaa chithran bahut sundar hua he or yah hamen chanakya ke samay main miltaa he, jab ‘arya’ shabd ‘naagarik’ ke rup main prayukt miltaa he
 Some old legend may have descended into this legend in the later period of Chanakya

 Ujjayini's kingdom was different then, Kosala's was different
 yahan bhi ujjayini kaa varnan he

 It is said that Bhasparnit 'charudatta' has been modified by adding a story of a Chaturangi metaphor by a later Shudra poet
 vastut: isaki kathavstu kaa aadhaar brihatkatha or kathasaritsagar main varnit kathaon main miltaa he
 Ujjayini is the center of the story of 'mritchkatik'
 vah itnaa bada nagar he ki patliputra kaa samvahak uski prasiddhi sunakar basane ko, dhandha praapt karne ko, aata he
 At that time he does not call Pataliputra a metropolis
 iskaa matlab he ki us samay patliputra se adhik mahatv ujjayini kaa tha
 Apparently Pataliputra was Pataliputra in Buddha's time, while Mahasen Chand at Ujjayini was a prosperous kingdom of Pradyot
 duusari pracheenta he ki isamen das pratha bahut he
 The slave-maids were freed by giving money
 us samaaj main ganika bhi vadhoo ban jaati thi

 There is a sense of rebellion in him
 atyaachaari ko vah pashu kii tarah maravaata he, stri ko unchaa uthaata tathaa das sthaavarak ko azaad karata he

 swatantraaa ke saath hi 14 agast ko pakistan adhirajya or 15 agast ko bhartiya sangh kii sansthapana kii gai
 In this development, mainly the province of Bengal in British India was divided into East Pakistan and West Bengal state of India and similarly Punjab province of British India was divided into Punjab province of western Pakistan and Punjab state of India
 isi dauraan british bharat main se ceylone or burma ko bhi alag kiya gaya, lekin ise bharat ke vibhaajan main nahin shaamil kiya jaataa he
 Similarly, the partition of Pakistan in 1971 and the establishment of Bangladesh are also not counted in this development
 15 agast 1947 kii aadhi raat ko bharat or pakistan kanoonee taur par do swatantra raashtra bane
 But Pakistan's power conversion rituals were performed in Karachi on 14 August so that the last British Viceroy Louis Mountbatten, both in Karachi and New Delhi could participate in the rituals
 isliye pakistan main swatantraaa diwas 14 agast or bharat main 15 agast ko manaaya jaataa he
 Crores of people were affected by the partition of India
 vibhaajan ke dauraan hui hinsa main kareeb 5 lakh log maare gaye or kareeb 1
45 karod sharnaarthiyon ne apana ghar-baar chhodkar bahumat sampradaay vaale desh main sharan lee
 The British rulers of India always followed the policy of "divide and rule" in India
 unhone bharat ke nagarikon ko sampradaay ke anusaar alag-alag samoohon main baant kar rakhaa
 Some of his policies discriminated against Hindus and some against Muslims
 20veen sadi aate-aate musalmaan hinduon ke bahumat se darane lage or hinduon ko lagane laga ki british sarkaar or bhartiya netaa musalamaanon ko visheshadhikaar dene or hinduon ke prati bhedbhaav karne main lage hai
 Therefore, when the spirit of independence began to emerge in India, the leaders of both sects were competing in controlling the freedom struggle
 san 1906 main dhaka main bahut se musalmaan netaaon ne milakar muslim lig kii sthapana kii
 These leaders were of the view that Muslims had less rights than majority Hindus and that the Indian National Congress represented Hindus
 muslim lig ne alag-alag samay par alag-alag maangen rakhin
 At the conference of the Muslim League in 1930, the famous Urdu poet Muhammad Iqbal raised the demand for a separate state for Muslims for the first time in a speech
 1935 main sindh praant kii vidhaan sabha ne bhi yahi maang uthaai
 Iqbal and Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar asked Muhammad Ali Jinnah to support this demand
 is samay tak jinna hindu-muslim ekta ke paksh main lagate the, lekin dhire-dhire unhone aarope lagaana shuru kar diya ki congressi netaa musalamaanon ke hiton par dhyaan nahin de rahe
 At the 1940 Muslim League Conference in Lahore, Jinnah clearly stated that he wanted two different nations
 hindu mahasabha jaise hindu sanghathan bharat ke bantwaare ke prabal virdohi the, lekin maanate the ki hinduon or musalamaanon main matbhed hai
 In a speech at the conference of Hindu Mahasabha in Allahabad in 1937, Veer Savarkar said - India is not a nation today, there are two nations here - Hindu and Muslim
 congress ke adhiktar netaa panth-nirpeksh the or sampradaay ke aadhaar par bharat kaa vibhaajan karne ke viruddh the
 Mahatma Gandhi believed that Hindus and Muslims could live together and they should live together
 unhone vibhaajan kaa ghor virodh kiya: "meri puri aatma is vichaar ke viruddh vidroh karti he ki hindu or musalmaan do virdohi mat or samskritiyaan hai
 To approve such a doctrine is like rejecting God for me
 " bahut saalon tak gandhi or unke anuyaayiyon ne koshish kii ki musalmaan congress ko chhod kar na jaaen or is prakriya main hindu or musalmaan garam dalon ke netaa unase bahut chidh gaye
 The British plannedly promoted suspicion of both Hindu and Muslim sects
 muslim lig ne agast 1946 main sidhi kaarywahi diwas manaaya or kalakatta main bheeshan dange kiye jisamen kareeb 5000 log maare gayi or bahut se ghayal hue
 In such an environment, all the leaders were under pressure to accept the partition so that the country does not come completely into a state of war
 bharat ke vibhaajan ke dhaanche ko '3 june plan' yaa mountbaton yojana kaa naam diya gaya
 The boundary between India and Pakistan was set by Sir Cyril Radcliffe, a London lawyer
 hindu bahumat vaale ilaake bharat main or muslim bahumat vaale ilaake pakistan main shaamil kiye gaye
 On 18 July 1947, the British Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act which finalized the process of partition
 is samay british bharat main bahut se rajya the jinke raajaaon ke saath british sarkaar ne tarah-tarah ke samjhaute kar rakhe the
 These 565 states were given the freedom to choose who they would like to join India or Pakistan
 adhiktar rajyon ne bahumat dharm ke aadhaar par desh chunaa
 There was a lot of controversy in the integration of the states whose rulers chose the country which suited the majority religion
 vibhaajan ke baad pakistan ko sanyukt raashtra main nae sadsy ke rup main shaamil kiya gaya or bharat ne british bharat kii kursi sanbhali
 The wealth of British India was shared between the two countries but this process began to drag on for too long
 gandhiji ne bharat sarkaar par dabaav daalaa ki vah pakistan ko dhan jaldi bheje jabaki is samay tak bharat or pakistan ke bich yuddh shuru ho chukaa tha or dabaav badhaane ke liye anshan shuru kar diya
 The Indian government had to succumb to this pressure and send money to Pakistan
 22 oktober 1947 ko pakistan ne kashmir par akraman kar diya, usase purv mountbaton ne bharat sarkaar se pakistan sarkaar ko 55 karod rupee kii raashi dene kaa paraamarsh diya tha
 The Union Cabinet decided to postpone giving this amount in view of the attack but at the same time Gandhi started a fast-unto-death to get this amount immediately, as a result of which this amount was given to Pakistan against the interests of India
 nathuram godse ne mahatma gandhi ke is kaam ko unki hatya karne kaa ek kaaran bataaya
 Many scholars believe that the British government did not handle the process of partition properly
 chunki swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa pehle or vibhaajan kii ghoshnaa baad main kii gayi, desh main shanti kaayam rakhane kii jimmevary bharat or pakistan kii nayi sarkaron ke sar par ai
 Nobody thought that many people would go from here
 logon kaa vichaar tha ki donon deshon main alpamat sampradaay ke logon ke liye suraksha kaa intazaam kiya jayega
 But the new governments of the two countries did not have the necessary arrangements to deal with violence and crime
 falswaroop danga fasaad hua or bahut se logon kii jane gayi or bahut se logon ko ghar chhodkar bhaagna padaa
 It is estimated that about 5 to 3 million people died during this period, some in riots and some due to travel difficulties

 In the months following Partition, there was a massive mass transfer between the two new countries
 pakistan main bahut se hinduon or sikhon ko balaat beghar kar diya gaya
 But in India Gandhiji pressurized the Congress and ensured that Muslims could stay in India if they wanted
 seemaa rekhaaen tay hone ke baad lagbhag 1

 According to the displaced census of 1951, 72,26,000 Muslims left India after partition and went to Pakistan and 72,49,000 Hindus and Sikhs left Pakistan
 isamen se 78 pratishat sthanantaran pashchim main, mukhyatya punjab main hua
 The transfer of power to India and Pakistan in August 1947 was the first significant step by Britain towards ending colonial rule, with far-reaching consequences for its international power

 In most of the divisions, the violence took place in this division much more than the violence between different religious communities

 He also divided Ireland, Palestine and Cyprus
 usne in vibhaajanon kaa kaaran yah bataaya ki alag-alag samudaayon ke log ek saath milakar nahin kar sakate
 While these divisions were not only due to religious and racial reasons, it also included the strategic and political interests of Britain, on the basis of which it made its strategy at the time of the pacts and carried out partitions

 Hazrat Umar was born in Mecca

 Umar was one of the famous wrestlers of Mecca, who had a great influence in Mecca
 umr salanaa pahalwani ke muqablon main hissaa lete the
 Initially, Hazrat Umar was a staunch enemy of Islam
 or mohammad sahab ko jaan se maarna chaahate the
 Omar initially used to do fetishism
 umr makka main ek samrudgh parivaar se the, bahut bahadur tathaa diler vyakit the
 Omar did not like Muslims, nor did Muhammad's mission
 parantu paigambar muhammd sahab ek shaam kaabe ke paas jaakar allaah se dua kiya ki allaah umr ko yaa amr abu jahal donon main se jo tujko priy ho hidaayat de
 This prayer was accepted in favor of Omar
 umr ek baar paigambar ke katl ke iraade se nikle the, raste main naeem naam kaa ek shaks mila jisane umr ko bataaya ki unki bahan tathaa unke pati islam laa chuke hai
 Omar got angry and went to the sister's house
 vah donon ghar par kuran pard rahe the
 Umar started asking for the Quran but he refused
 umr krodhit hokar un donon ko maarane lage
 But his sister said we will die but will not leave Islam
 bahan ke chehre se khun tapakataa dekhakar umr ko shame aayi tathaa galati kaa ahsaas hua
 Said that i want to read the Quran, promised not to humiliate it
 jab umr ne kuran padhaa do bole yaqinan ye ishwar kii vaani he kisi manushya kii rachana nahin ho sakati
 In a miracle, Omar accepted the truth of the Quran and went to meet Muhammad
 mohammad sahab ko bahut prasannataa hui jab umr islam main daakhil ho gayi
 Muslims ran a wave of happiness over Omar's bringing Islam
 umr ne elaan kiya ki ab sab milke namaaz kaabe main padhenge jo ki pehle koi kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa tha
 Omar was an enemy of Islam but now he became the protector of Islam
 umr ko islam main dekhakar mohammad sahab ke shatruvon main koharaam much gaya
 Now Islam had got a sharp sword named Umar which made all Mecca tremble

 Medina had become a new center of Islam

 In 624 AD, Muslims had to fight the battle of Badr, in which Hazrat Umar also played an important role
 badr kii jang main musalamaanon kii fatah hui tathaa makka ke musharikon kii haar hui
 a year after the battle of Badr, the Meccans came together to attack Madina, the battle took place near a hill called Uhud
 jang ke shuru main muslim sena baari padi lekin kuch kaarnon vash muslimon kii haar hui
 Some people sparked the rumor that many Muslims were frightened if Muhammad Sahib was martyred, Omar also threw a sword and started saying that it is useless to live now
 kuch derbar pataa chalaa kii ye ek afvaah he to dubaara khadey hue
 After this, they lived together in Khandak's war
 umr ne muslim sena kaa netratv kiya ant main makka bhi fatah ho gaya
 Even after this, many battles had to be faced, Omar led an eye in all those wars
 8 june san 632 ko mohammad sahab duniya ko alavida kah gayi
 Omar and some people did not believe that Muhammad could also have death
 ye khabar sunakar umr apane hosh kho baithe, apni talwaar nikaal lee tathaa jor-jor se kehane lage ki jisane kaha ki nabi kii maut ho gai he main uskaa sar tan se juda kar duungaa
 On this delicate occasion, then Hazrat Abu Bakr gave a Khutba meaning speech to Muslims which is very famous: phir koran kii aayat pard kar sunai: Hearing from Hazrat Abu Bakr, all the people fell on their knees, Umar also fell on his knees and accepted this great sorrow
 jab hazarat abu bakr ko laga ki unka vaqt nazadik he to unhone agle khalipha ke liye hazarat umr ko chunaa
 Omar was well known for his extraordinary will power, intelligence, political, impartiality, justice and care for the poor and underprivileged
 hazarat abu bakr ko puri tarah se umr kii shakti or unako safal hone kii kshamta ke bare main pataa tha
 The succession of Omar was thus not as troublesome as any of the others
 hazarat abu bakr ne apni mrityu ke pehle hi hazarat usmaan ko apni vasiyat likhavai ki umr unke uttaradhikari honge
 Hazrat Abu Bakr died in August 634 AD

 In the culture of the Indian subcontinent, it has been so that if a lion becomes popular, then it becomes involved in folk culture like a motto
 udhaaharan ke liye: Some words regarding sher-o-shayari are prevalent in the Indian subcontinent and Iran, such as: kripaya kuch dhvaniyon ke uccharan par dhyaan dijiye: Hindi shayari for new shayari aarambhvaad - kaary sambandhi nyaayashastra kaa siddhant
 Work is generated due to reasons
 utpatti ke pehle kaary nahin hota
 If the work had been before the origin, production would not have been required
 isi saarvajaneen anubhav ke aadhaar par nyaayashastra main utpann kaary ko utpatti ke pehle asat mana jaataa he
 Many causes come together and begin the construction of some earlier discrete work
 isi asat kaary ke nirmaan ke siddhant ko aarambhvaad kaha jaataa he
 Contrary to this theory, since the work has been considered as the first satta in the Sattva Karyavadi philosophy, there is no beginning of work there
 keval die hue kaary ko spasht kar dena hi kaary kii utpatti hoti he
 This is the reason why the initialism of Sankhya, Vedanta etc

 Therefore, according to justice, work is always new for its own reasons

 The commanding officer said that Nautiyal ji and his family should not be teased at night, but they have to surrender as soon as morning
 The whole family was terrified, Mother locked them in the upper room and locked them from outside and said that she had left at night
 On this too, the tehsildar Chandan Singh climbed the stairs and started shouting, "hamane ab tumhe giraftaar kar diya he, tum samarpan kar do" Ram Prasad ji got very angry at this audacity of the Tehsildar, he kicked the door loudly and broke out the door, grabbed the tehsildar by the throat and threw it down the balcony, the tehsildar fired from below, Ram Prasad ji Also, with his pistol, he fired a fire at the tehsildar, he escaped due to the darkness, the sick child was horrified at the sound of firing and went to the fields of Mandua

 ek aarambhik aadhunik prakaar ke meglev train kaa varnan ji
 aar
 polgreen kii america patent 31,58,765, magnetic system of transportesan main kiya gaya tha
 "maglev" was first used by Canadian Patents and Development Ltd
 in "magnetic Levitation Guidance", a patent in the United States
 "meglev" shabd keval vishesh rup se chumbakeey uttolan evam pranodan ke liye banaae gaye vaahanon ko hi nahin, balki railway system ko bhi sanderbhit karata he
 All operational implementations of maglev technology have minimal overlap with wheeled train technology and are not compatible with conventional rail tracks
 chunki ve maujuuda aadharbhoot sanrachanaon kaa saajha nahin kar sakate hai, isliye in meglev pranaaliyon ko paripurna parivahan pranaaliyon ke rup main hi banaaya janaa chahie
 The applied Levitation SPM maglev system is interoperable with steel rail tracks and it allowed maglev vehicles and conventional trains to run on the same track at the same time
 germany main emeen ne ek meglev system kaa bhi nirmaan kiya jo paaramparik patariyon ke saath kaam karata tha lekin ise kabhi puri tarah se viksit nahin kiya gaya
 There are two particularly notable types of maglev technology: ek or prayogtmak praudyogiki - chumbakeey gatibodhak nilamban he, jiskaa dizine banaaya gaya, jise ganitiya aadhaar par siddh kiya gaya, sahakarmiyon dwaara isaki samiksha kii gai or ekasvadhikaar pradaan kiya gaya, lekin abhi bhi iskaa nirmaan nahin hua he, jo train ko uthaane or ise iske niyat sthaan par sthapit karne ke liye ek steel trek ke paas ek sthaayee chumbak sarini ke aakarshak chumbakeey bal kaa istemaal karti he
 Numerous research has been conducted in other technologies such as repulsive permanent magnets and superconducting magnets
 maujuuda vidyut chumbakeey nilamban pranaaliyon main, train ispaat kii ek patari par uthta he jabaki train se sanlagn vidyut chumbak neeche se patari kii taraf jhuke hue hai
 This system is usually arranged on a series of C-shaped arms and the upper part of the arm is attached to the vehicle and the lower part is attached to the magnet in the inner edge
 patari upree or nichle kinaaron ke bich sthit hoti he
 The magnetic attraction varies with the cube of the distance, so slight changes in the distance between the magnets and the track also produce a much variable force
 bal main kiye gaye ye parivartan gatyaatmak rup se asthir hote hai - yadi anukultam sthiti main halkaa sa bhi vichlan hota he, to isamen vruddhi ho sakati he or trek se ek aparivartansheel duuri ) par ek train ko banaae rakhane ke liye pratipushti niyantran kii jatil pranaaliyon kii jarurat padati he
 a major advantage of suspended maglev systems is that they operate at all speeds, while electromagnetic systems operate at a speed of at least about 30 kmph
 yah ek alag kam gati vaali nilamban pranali kii aavashyaktaa ko samaapt kar detii he or parinamswaroop yah trek leout ko saral bana saktaa he
 The downside of this is that the dynamic instability of the system requires over-tolerance of the track, which can reverse, or eliminate this advantage
 is avadharana kii atyadhik uljhan ke falswaroop lathvet ko is baat kii chintaa thi ki apekshit sahishnutaa vaale ek trek kaa nirmaan karne ke liye chumbakon or patari ke bich ke antaraal ko us sthaan tak badha dena hoga jahaan chumbak anuchit dhang se bade honge
 In practice, this problem was addressed through enhanced performance of feedback systems, which allow the system to run with deeper tolerance
 vidyut gatibodhak nilamban main, patari or train donon ek chumbakeey kshetra par bal lagaate hai or in chumbakeey kshetron ke darmyaan pratikaarak bal kii vajah se train uttolit ho jaataa he
 The magnetic field in the train is generated by either an array of electromagnets or permanent magnets
 taron main ek prerit chumbakeey kshetra yaa trek main anya chaalak pattiyon dwaara trek main pratikaarak bal paidaa hota he
 a major advantage of repulsive maglev systems is that they are inherently stable - a slight contraction in the distance between the track and the magnets generates too much force that forces the magnets back to their original position, while in the distance a slight increase reduces the force and once again the vehicle returns to perfect isolation
 koi pratipushti niyantran jaruri nahin he
 Repulsive systems also have a major downside
 dhimi gati par, in coilon or parinami chumbakeey pravaah main prerit dhara itani bhi adhik nahin hoti he ki vah train ke vajan ko sahaara de sake
 For this reason it is very important to have wheels or some other type of landing gear in the train to support the train till it reaches the speed with the ability to maintain leverage
 chunki train, udhaaharan ke taur par upkaran kii kharabi kii vajah se, kisi bhi sthaan par ruuk saktaa he, isliye sampoorn trek main train kii nimna-gati or ucch-gati donon tarah ke sanchaalan ko sahaara dene kii kshamta honi chahie
 Another downside to this is that the repulsive systems naturally create an area in the track in front and back of the lifting magnets that works against the magnets and produces a kind of stretch position
 yah aam taur par nimna gati vaali pranaaliyon ke liye ek chintaa kaa vishay he, ucchtar gati vaali pranaaliyon main is prabhaav ke liye utana samay nahin nikal paata he jisase yah isaki sampoorn kshamta or anya prakaar ke khinchaav par haaavee ho sake
 The traction force can be used to the advantage of an electromagnetic system, however, because it generates a variable force in the tracks that can be used as a reactionary system to drive the train, with a separate Reaction plates are not needed, as in most linear motor systems
 lathvet ne imperial college kii apni prayogshaala main "pargaman-pravaah" jaisi pranaaliyon ke vikaas kaa netritv kiya
 Alternatively, propulsion coils from the guideway are used to apply force to the magnet of the train and to propel the train forward
 train par bal lagane vaale pranodan coil prabhavi taur par ek raikhik motor hote hai: coilon ke madhyam se pravaahit hone vaali ek parivartansheel dhara ek nirantar parivartaneey chumbakeey kshetra kaa nirmaan karti he jo trek ke saath aage kii taraf badhata rahata he
 The frequency of the variable current is synchronized to match the speed of the train
 train main lagi chumbakon ke bal se nirmit kshetra or lagu kshetra ke bich kaa antarlamb ek aisa bal utpann karata he jo train ko aage kii taraf le jaataa he
 Each implementation of the magnetic levitation principle for train-like travel involves advantages and disadvantages
 pranali kii nihit asthirataa or bahari pranaaliyon dwaara aavashyak nirantar sudhaar kii vajah se kampan ke mudde uth sakate hai
 Neither the Inductrack nor the superconducting EDS have the ability to levitate a stationary vehicle, although the Inductrack provides levitation for a very low speed; These systems require wheels
 iemes pranaliyaan pahiyaa-viheen hoti hai
 The German transrapid, the Japanese HSST and the Korean Rotem EMS maglev levitate, for which the required power is obtained from the guideway using power tracks for the latter two maglevs and without using any wires for the transrapid

 Some systems use tap flux systems, also known as tap current systems, these systems use a coil that is rotated so that it enters two opposing, variable areas

 Some systems propose the use of vacatrain — a blank tube used in a vehicle with maglev technology — to minimize air traction
 isamen gati evam dakshata ko badhaane kii bahut adhik kshamta he, jabaki paaramparik meglev trainon kii adhikansh urja vaayu karshan main nasht ho jaati he
 a potential risk for passengers of trains operating in empty tubes is that passengers face the risk of cabin pressure retraction until tunnel safety monitoring systems re-pressurize the tube in the event of a train malfunction or accident Can
 rand korporation ne ek vaikum tub train kaa dizine taiyaar kiya he jo siddhanthata atlantic yaa america ko 20 minute main paar kar saktaa he
 Energy for maglev trains is used to accelerate the train and can be regained when the train slows down
 iskaa istemaal train ko uttolit karne or train ke sanchalan ko sthir karne ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 The main part of this energy is necessary to force the train through air
 iske alaava kuch urja kaa istemaal air condishning, heating, prakaash vyavastha or anya vividh pranaaliyon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The percentage of electricity used for levitation at very low speeds can be quite significant
 iske alaava bahut kam duriyon ke liye twaran ke liye istemaal hone vaali urja par vichaar kiya ja saktaa tha
 But the power used to overcome air traction increases with the cube of velocity and therefore dominates at high speeds and the track design work for EMS maglev systems is limited to any other than point-by-point services
 Is also challenging for something
 ghumaav saumy hona chahie, jabaki switch bahut lambe hote hai or bijli ke pravaah ke samay ise tuutane se bachaane ke liye isaki dekhbhaal karne kii jarurat he
 An SPM maglev system, in which the vehicle is permanently levitated on tracks, can quickly switch tracks using electronic controls where the track has no moving parts

 Unlike airplanes, maglev trains are powered by electricity and thus do not need to carry fuel
 udaan bharne or neeche utarane ke dauraan hone vaali durghatnaon ke samay vimaan eendhan ek bahut bada khatra ban jaataa he
 In addition, electric trains emit less carbon dioxide, especially when powered by atomic or renewable sources

 Battles against the Chin dynasty lasted until 1234, but seeing the progress of his military campaign, Genghis Khan left the war and returned to his homeland to Mongolia under the supervision of his followers

 Jalaluddin crossed the Indus River to India where he requested help from Sultan Iltutmish of Delhi

 According to Professor A
N
 Upadhyay, their time is first century AD, but there is no definitive evidence about their period
 shravanbelagola ke shilaalekh sankhya 40 ke anusaar inkaa dikshakalin naam 'padmanandi' tha or simandhar swami se unhen divyagyaan praapt hua tha
 Acharya Kundakund took Digambar Muni Diksha at the age of 11
 inke diksha guru kaa naam jinchandra tha
 He was a great scholar of Jainism
 inke dwaara rachit samaysar, niyamsar, pravachan, ashtapahud, or panchastikaay - panch parmagam granth hai

 He has first given a logical rendering of jain-agam-agreed substances
 inke sabhi uplabdh granth praakrit main hai
 It has been his specialty that he has rendered Jainism in the light of his own philosophical ideology, and not only re-discourses of Jain proceeds
 inke vibhinn granthon main gyaan, darshan or charitra kaa nirupan miltaa he
 He wrote independent texts to describe each subject, which is called Pahud
 inke 84 pahudon kaa ullekh jain vaanmay main miltaa he
 Following are his main texts: jain darshan ko unhone ek nai drushti di he
 He is considered to be the exponent of 'transcendental imperialism'
 jain aagmon main dravya or paryaay main bhed or abhed donon mana jaataa he
 But according to them, their distinction is practical, ultimately both are integral
 isi prakaar aatma main varna kaa sadbhaav or asadbhaav donon aagamasammat hai, parantu inke anusaar vyaavhaarik rup main to varna aatma main hai, parmaarthik rup main nahin hai
 He considered the unity of body and soul in practice, but in the determination, he considered the difference between the two
 ve dravya ko satta se abhinn maanate he
 In Vaisesika philosophy, power considers matter to be true due to the general, but they say that in this opinion, matter will become dissatisfied due to separation from power
 at: dravya satta rup hi he or yahi paramtatv he
 Power develops in the form of matter, quality and substance in the country, so everything is a matter of matter

 Regarding the atom, he says that the final component of all the wings is the atom

 The atom was said to be the resultant element containing senses, smell, color and touch and considered to be the origin of earth, water, light and air
 aupnishad or mahayan darshanon main vyavhaar or parmarth athwa pratibhaas or satya kaa bhed mana gaya he
 By considering this distinction, spiritualist philosophers honor an individualism
 jain darshan bhootvaadi he, aadhyatmavaadi nahin
 Nevertheless, he considered a distinction between behavior and determination
 jo saamanyat: dikhaai detaa he vah sarvada satya nahin hota or koi aavashyak nahin ki satya sadaa shuddh rup main gochar ho
 He considered three forms of the soul
 bahya padaarthon main aasakt, deh ko apane se abhinn samajhane vaali moodhaatma bahiraatma he
 When the body becomes aware, it is said that the soul that is moksamarga is the conscience
 dhyanabal se karmmal kaa kshay ho jane par jab aatma shuddh rup praapt kar leti he
 Then it is called God
 isi paramatma ko unhone shiv, brahma, vishnu, buddha aadi kahkar tatkaaleen darshan se apane ko parmarthat: abhinn ghoshit kiya he jo sambhavat: kisi jain acharya ne nahin kiya
 It is his specialty that distinguishes him from the other Jainacharyas and is a reflection of his syncretic tendency
 unhone aatma ko kaary-karan se bhinn maanakar sankhya ke kutasth purush kii kalpana ke saath samanvit kiya parantu aatma ko akarta nahin mana
 In his opinion, the soul is not the agent of non-committal culmination, but it is also considered to be the doer due to its consequential
 aatma gyaan aadi swagat parinaamon kaa to karta he hi
 He said that the element cannot be described with behavior and determination
 tatv pakshaatikrant he
 The creature is in pure form, not impaired
 bandha-abandh se vimukt jeev hi sahaysar or paramatma paramtatv kaha gaya he
 Practices are resolved with determination

 The letters of the alphabet molded from a metal or alloy are called 'type'

 The laws, dimensions and templates of a book or other printed item should be compatible with its subject

 should be suitable in practical manner

 In this field, type arts should be presented to adopt every new ideology like fine arts

 In 1948, a system of separate residence for blacks and whites was implemented by the National Party government in South Africa
 ise hi rangabhed niti yaa aparthit kehete hai
 In the language of Africa, "aparthid" literally means separation or seclusion
 yah niti san 1994 main samaapt kar di gayi
 Nelson Mandela fought a lot against this, for which he was kept in jail for a long time
 dakshin africa main rahane vaale dach mul ke shwet nagarikon kii bhashaa africans main 'aparthid' kaa shabdic arth he, parthaky yaa alahadaapan

 Apartheid then dominated the political, social and economic life of South Africa for the next half century

 Apartheid came to an end in the nineties with the establishment of democratic rule of majority blacks under the leadership of the African National Congress and Nelson Mandela

 It begins with Dutch colonists establishing Cap Town as their refreshment station

 At the same time, Europeans living among the African population of the region began to see themselves as rulers of black Africans
 shaskaon or shasiton ke bich shreshthata or nimnata kaa bhed karne ke liye kaalon ko europiyanon se haath bhar dur rakhane kaa aagrah panapana zaruri tha
 The paradox of the situation was that blacks also had an intimate presence in the lives of white European owners

 Although the apartheid law was enacted in 1948, white governments in South Africa continued to adopt a discriminatory attitude against the Blacks

 But all the facilities were available to a handful of white workers

 On the other hand, Cecil Rhodes, who invested in mining and had been the Prime Minister of Cap Colony and his allies, aimed to expand British influence
 is pratiyogita ke garbh se jo yuddh niklaa use boar waar ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The two sides of this war, which continued from 1899 to 1902, were pro-apartheid Europeans, but black soldiers were being filled as fodder in the cannons of both sides

 In the seventies, liberals working among whites also waged a front against apartheid and young Africans began to show a tendency in favor of an ideology that elevated black consciousness
