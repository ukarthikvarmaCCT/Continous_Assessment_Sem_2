 manushya ko vidhipradutt anek adhikaar praapt hai
 The human race has, from time to time, been evoking many legal measures for the enforcement of those rights
 bharat main vidhik upayon kaa sthool vibhaajan do shreniyon main kiya ja saktaa he - Statutory remedies are provided by the constitution and constitutional measures originate from the constitution
 bhartiya samvidhan kaa tritiy khand samvidhan dwaara shasit prayek vyakti ko kuch adhikaar pradaan karata he
 The state has the power to regulate the consumption of these rights for the welfare of the society
 in sanvaidhanik adhikaron main se anek adhikaar anya likhit samvidhanvaale deshon dwaara bhi sweekrut hai
 But the Constitution of India is unequaled in this subject because the measures for enforcement of these rights are also clearly specified in it
 hamaare samvidhan kii dhara 32 yah udghoshan karti he ki samvidhan ke tritiy khand dwaara pradutt adhikaron ke pravartan ke liye sarvocch nyaayalay ke samaksh nirdhaarit niyamanusaar yachika prastut kii ja sakati he
 Thus this treatment is guaranteed by the Constitution
 ukt dhara kii hi upadhara sarvocch nyaayalay ko yah adhikaar pradaan karti he ki vah adhikaron ke pravartan ke liye bandi pratyakshikaran pradesh, paramadesh, nishedhadesh, adhikarprichha pradesh tathaa utpreshan sahit kisi prakaar kaa pradesh, nirdesh athwa aadesh jari kar saktaa he
 Section 226 of the Constitution empowers the High Court of the state to issue instructions, orders and orders not only for the enforcement of constitutional rights, but also for "any other purpose"
 in upachaaron kaa uddeshy manushya ke vidhik adhikaron ke pravartan ke liye shighrata tathaa mitvyayitapurna upaay pradaan karnaa he jisase ye adhikaar vidhayika tathaa karypalika ke hastkshep se mukt rahen
 The remedial powers of Supreme Court and High Court are not limited to the orders mentioned in Sections 32 and 226 of the Indian Constitution, but they can also issue any orders, instructions and orders as required
 is prakaar ye upachaaratmak pratibandh paryaapt vyapak tathaa aseemit hai
 When such an opportunity is present when the said order is incapable of restoring the rights of the person against the illegal act of the state, the court is also free to revoke any other order
 upyukt maamalon main, yadi nyaayalay uchit samajhe to, vah ghoshnaayen karne ke liye bhi swatantra he
 The Supreme Court can issue orders, directions or orders in the name of any officer within the Indian border
 ucch nyaayalay ke adhikaar uski kshetreey seemaa tak hi simit hai
 Orders or orders issued by the High Court are issued for the enforcement of the fundamental rights of the property or "for any other purpose"
 "anya kisi uddeshy ke liye" is ansh kii vyakhya karte hue sarvocch nyaayalay ne yah nishkarsh nikaala he ki is shakti kaa prayog ucch nyaayalay "anya vidhik adhikaron" ke pravartan ke liye hi kar saktaa he
 Therefore, it is clear that the High Court will probably not exercise its power to enforce any other rights other than the enforcement of constitutional and other legal rights
 falat: naitik adhikaron ke pravartan ke liye nyaayalay is shakti kaa prayog nahin kar saktaa
 Under Section 32 of the Constitution of India, before the Supreme Court, the Court is bound to exercise its power after proving hindrance in the consumption of fundamental rights, while on the other hand the High Court as per Section 226 of the Constitution has its power under its discretion
 Is and on some occasions it is not used

 Although scientific methods have been used in ancient times in Babylonia, Egypt and Greece, and in modern times by Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Bacon, and Decart, in the achievement of systematic knowledge, "objectivism" is generally used only for the philosophy of Kant

 devanagari lipi kii jaden pracheen brahmi parivaar main hai
 The script of some inscriptions from Gujarat, dating back to the first century to the fourth century, very closely correspond to the Nagari script
 7veen shatabdi or uske baad nagari kaa prayog lagaataar dekha ja saktaa he
 There is a difference of opinion about the origin of the word 'nagari'
 kuch log iskaa keval 'nagar kii' yaa 'nagaron main vyavahat' aisa arth karke peechha chhudaate hai
 Many people are of the opinion that the name was derived from the Gujarat Brahmanas
 gujarat ke nagar brahman apni utpatti aadi ke sambandh main skandapurana ke nagar khand kaa pramaan dete hai
 In the Nagar Khand, the Vedaveta of the king of Miraclepur called the Brahmins to settle in his city
 usamen yah bhi varnit he ki ek vishesh ghatana ke kaaran chamatkarpur kaa naam 'nagar' padaa or vahaan jaakar based hue brahmanon kaa naam 'nagar'
 The Nagar Brahmins of Gujarat refer to modern Badnagar as 'city' and their place
 atah nagari aksharon kaa nagar brahmanon se sambandh maan lene par bhi yahi maananaa padataa he ki ye akshar gujarat main vahiin se gaye jahaan se nagar brahman gaye
 On the other hand in Gujarat, many inscriptions, tamrapatras, etc
 between the seventh century have been found in Brahmi and Southern style western script, not in Nagari
 gujarat main sabase purana pramanik lekh, jisamen nagari akshar bhi hai, gurjaravanshi raja jaibhat kaa kalchuri sanwat 456 kaa tamrapatr hai
 Most of this Tamrashasana is in the then script of Gujarat, only the signature of the king is in the script of North India which resembles Nagari
 ek baat or bhi he
 In Gujarat, all the donations received in Northern India i
e
 in the Nagari script are mostly given to Brahmins taken from Kanyakubj, Patali, Pundravardhan etc
 rashtrakut raajaaon ke prabhaav se gujarat main utriy bharat kii lipi vishesh rup se prachlit hui or nagar brahmanon ke dwaara vyabahvat hone ke kaaran vahaan nagari kahalaai
 This script was of Middle Aryavarta, being the most accessible, beautiful and systematic, became the principal script of India
 'nagari lipi' kaa ullekh pracheen granthon main nahin miltaa
 The reason for this is that in ancient times she was called 'brahmi', she had no different name
 yadi 'nagar' yaa 'nagar' brahmanon se 'nagari' kaa sambandh maan liya jaay to aadhik se adhik yahi kahana padegaa ki yah naam gujarat main jaakar pad gaya or kuch dinon tak udhar hi prasiddh rahaa
 In the ancient Buddhist text 'lalitavistar', the names of the 64 scripts that were taught to the Buddha are not named 'nagari script', 'brahmi script'
 'lalitvistar' kaa chini bhashaa main anuwaad i0 sa0 308 main hua tha
 Names of 18 scripts have been given in the 'pannavana' Sutra and 'samavayang Sutra' of the Jains, in which the first name is Bambhi
 unheen ke bhagawatisutra kaa aarambh 'namo bambhie libiye' se hota he
 The earliest mention of Nagari is found in the Jain scripture Nandisutra, which according to Jain scholars dates back to 453 AD
 'nityasodshikarnav' ke bhashya main bhaskaranand 'nagar lipi' kaa ullekh karte hai or likhte hai ki nagar lipi' main 'e' kaa rup trikon he 
 It is evident that in Ashokalpari, the shape of 'A' is a triangle in which the 'A' of today's Nagari is formed by being manipulated
 sheshakrishna naamak pandit ne, jinhen saade saat sau varsh ke lagbhag hue, apbhransh bhashaaon ko ginate hue 'nagar' bhashaa kaa bhi ullekh kiya he
 The oldest script found in India is that of Ashoka, except for the territories across the Sindh river, it is often found in the same form in India
 ashok ke samay se purv ab tak do chote se lekh mili hai
 One of these is inscribed in a single row on a small stone vessel placed inside a Buddhist stupa built by the Shakya castes in a place called 'piprava' in the valley of Napal and just a little behind the Buddha
 is lekh ke aksharon or ashok ke aksharon main koi vishesh antar nahin he
 The difference is so much that they lack Dargh swaraks
 doosraa ajmer se kuch dur badli naamak gram main mila hai mahavir sanwat 84 kaa he
 It is a section of a large article engraved on the column
 usamen 'viraab' main jo deergh 'i' kii maatra he vah ashok ke lekhon kii deergh 'i' kii maatra se bilkul niraali or puraani he
 The script which contains Ashoka's writings is the extracted Brahmi script of ancient Aryans or Brahmins
 jainon ke 'pragyapanaasutra' main likhaa he ki 'ardhamagadhi' bhashaa
 The script in which it is published is the Brahmi script '
 ardhamagadhi bhashaa mathura or patliputra ke bich ke pradesh kii bhashaa he jisase hindi nikali he
 Therefore, the Brahmi script is the script of Middle Aryavarta, which progressively developed the script which was called Nagari at the back
 magadh ke raja adityasena ke samay ke kutil magadhi aksharon main nagari kaa vartmaan rup spasht dikhaai padataa he
 From the ninth and tenth centuries CE, Nagari seems to be in its complete form
 kis prakaar ashoka ke samay ke aksharon se nagari akshar kramshah roopantarit hote hote bane hai yah pandit gaurishankar hirachand ojha ne 'pracheen lipimala' pustak main or ek nakshe ke dwaara spasht dikhaa diya he
 Mr
 Shamshastri has revealed a new theory regarding the origin of Indian script
 unka kahana ki pracheen samay main pratimaa banane ke purv devataaon kii puja kuch sankethik chihnon dwaara hoti thi, jo kai prakaar ke trikon aadi yantron ke madhya main likhe jate the
 These triangular etc
 instruments were called 'devnagar'
 un 'devanagaron' ke madhya main likhe janevaale anek prakaar ke sankethik chihn kalantar main akshar maane jane lage
 From this, these letters were named 'devanagari'

 rashtrakut raja "dantadurg" ke ek tamrapatr ke aadhaar par dakshin main "nagari" kaa prachlan sanwat 675 main tha
 There it was called "nandinagari"
 rajwanshon ke lekhon ke aadhaar par dakshin main 16veen shatee ke baad tak iskaa astitv miltaa he
 Scripts like "kathy", "mahajani", "rajasthani" and "gujarati" developed from Devanagari itself
 pracheen nagari kii purvi shakha se dasvin shatee ke aasapaas "banglaa" kaa aavirbhaav hua
 After the 11th century, "nepali" and the present "bengali", "maithili", and "oriya" scripts evolved from this
 bharatvarsh ke uttar pashchimi bhaagon main i
 8veen shatee tak "kutilalipi" prachlit thi
 Later, around the 10th century AD, "sharda script" developed from "crooked script" itself
 vartmaan kashmiri, taakri usee lipi ke parvarti vikaas hai
 The Southern style scripts derive from a modified version of the ancient Brahmi script found in the writings of the Kshatrapas and Andhravanshi kings, and some of them in the caves of Nasik, Karli, etc
 to the south
 
 This is how the following things emerge - devanagari lipi muslim shashan ke dauraan bhi istemaal hoti rahi he
 Devanagari has been the prevailing ancient script of India
 vibhinn murti-abhilekhon, shikha-lekhon, tamrapatron aadi main bhi devanagari lipi ke sahasraadhik abhilekh prapya hai, jinka kaal khand san 1008 i
 ke aasapaas he
 Earlier, the national word 'satyamev Jayate' is inscribed in the Devanagari script in the lower part of the Dharmachakra of the Ashoka Pillar located in Sarnath
 is stambh kaa nirmaan samraat ashok ne lagbhag 250 i

 Before the arrival of Muslims to India, the Indian language was Hindi and the script Devanagari or its metamorphic form, by which all works were performed
 musalamaanon ke rajtv kaal ke prarambh se samraat akbar ke rajtv kaal ke madhya tak rajasav vibhaag main hindi bhashaa or devanagari lipi kaa prachlan tha
 Despite the ignorance of the Indians' Persian language, the Persian language and its script were used in civil and criminal courts at the time
 yah muslim shaskaon kii maatrubhaasha thi
 After the arrival of Islam in India, Persian became a proud place of Sanskrit
 devanagari lipi main likhit sanskrit bhartiya shishton kii shisht bhashaa or dharmabhasha ke rup main tab kunthit ho gai
 But the Muslim rulers could not completely ignore the Sanskrit language written in the Devanagari script
 mahmud gaznavi ne apane rajya ke sikkon par devanagari lipi main likhit sanskrit bhashaa ko sthaan diya tha
 The court language did not change during Aurangzeb's rule, Hindi language and Devanagari script remained prevalent in the revenue department
 farsi kibale, patte rehanname aadi kaa hindi anuwaad anivaary hi rahaa
 Aurangzeb kingship period This imperative remained safe during Aurangzeb's later Muslim kingship period and British rule
 aurangzeb parvarti kaal main purvakaleen hindi niti main kisi prakaar kaa parivartan nahin hua
 In the latter part of the East India Company rule, the practice of the said Hindi translation was abolished due to the self-determination of the court staff and the British rulers paid attention to it
 farsi kibale, patte, rehanname aadi ke hindi anuwaad kaa unmoolan kisi rajagna ke dwaara nahin, sarkaar kii udaseenta or kachhari ke karmchaariyon ke farsi moh ke kaaran hua
 His selfishness was accumulated in this fascination

 is prakaar ke chaudaa patr rajasthan rajya abhilekhaagaar, bikaner main surakshit hai
 The majority of the handwritten documents in the Devanagari script relating to the statework of the later Mughal emperors are visible in the said archives, whose subjects were law, policy, award, punishment, citation, jagir, title, aid, donation, forgiveness, imprisonment, Gurugovind
 Singh, assumed office, grant, visit of emperor, death notice of emperor Aurangzeb, war army-march, address to officials The command-instruction, transfer-pdsthanpan etc

 Gradually, the Devanagari letters started disappearing due to the fashion of Urdu and Hindi opposition
 adalati or rajkeey kaamkaaj main urdu kaa bolbalaa hone se urdu padhe-likhe logon kii bhashaa banane lagi
 Urdu was widespread by the middle of the nineteenth century

 As is evident from this comment of Balmukundji- us samay anek vichaarak, sahityakar or saamajakarmi hindi or nagari ke samarthan main us samay maidan main utre
 This was a time when the language of Hindi prose could not be refined and refined, that is, no orderliness and certainty of Hindi prose could be created
