 7 Indian states east india company ke sipaahi deshi updravi or east india company ke british sainik bengal presidency ke british naagarik swayamsevak21 riyaasaten Other small states of Nepal's royalty 1857 kaa bhartiya vidroh, jise pratham bhartiya swatantraaa sangram, sipaahi vidroh or bhartiya vidroh ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he british shashan ke viruddh ek sashastr vidroh tha
 This rebellion lasted for two years in different regions of India
 is vidroh kaa aarambh chhavnee kshetron main choti jhadpon tathaa aagjanee se hua tha parantu janvari maas tak isane ek bada rup le liya
 The end of the revolt coincided with the end of the East India Company's rule in India and the British Crown's direct rule over the whole of India began for the next 90 years
 east india company ne robert clive ke netritv main san 1757 main plasi kaa yuddh jeeta
 In the post-war treaty, the British got the right to tax-free trade in Bengal
 san 1764 main baxur kaa yuddh jeetne ke baad angrejon kaa bengal par puri tarah se adhikaar ho gaya
 The victory in these two wars greatly increased the strength of the British and proved their military capability superior to the traditional Indian military capability
 company ne iske baad saare bharat par apana prabhaav failaana aarambh kar diya
 In 1843, the East India Company took possession of the Sindh region after a bloody battle
 san 1839 main maharaja ranjit singh kii mrityu ke baad kamjor hue punjab par angrejon ne apana haath badhaaya or san 1848 main doosraa angrej-sikh yuddh hua
 In 1849, the company also took control of Punjab
 san 1853 main aakhri maratha peshwa baaji raav ke dattak putr naanaa sahib kii padavi chin lee gayi or unka vaarshik kharchaa band kar diya gaya
 Berar in 1854 and Awadh were merged with the Company in 1856
 san 1857 ke vidroh ke vibhinn rajnatik, aarthik, dharmik, sainik tathaa saamaajik kaaran bataaye jate he Many historians believe that there was a belief in the public at that time that the British want to Christianize them by force or deception
 yah puri tarah se galat bhi nahin tha, kuch company adhikari dharm parivartan ke kaary main jute the
 However the company never approved the conversion
 company is baat se avgat thi ki dharm, parmparik bhartiya samaaj main vidroh kaa ek kaaran ban saktaa he
 Earlier, one of the reasons for the decline of the Portuguese from India and Japan in the sixteenth century was that they had tried to force Christianity on the masses
 lord dalhousie kii rajya hadapney kii naati ke antargat anek rajya jaise jhansi, avadh, satara, nagpur or sambalpur ko angreji rajya main mila liya gaya or inke uttaradhikari raja se angreji rajya se pension paane vaale karmchaaree ban gayi
 The royal families, zamindars and armies found themselves unemployed and marginalized
 ye log angrejon ke haathon apni sharmindagi or haar kaa badla lene ke liye taiyaar the
 In the eight years of Lord Dalhousie's rule, the area of one million square miles was taken over by the company
 iske atirikt east india company kii bengal sena main bahut se sipaahi avadh se bhartee hote the, ve avadh main hone vaali ghatnaon se achoote nahin rah sake
 The event, which was spoken in Calcutta by the royal family of Nagpur, was seen as a disrespect to the royal family
 bhartiya, company ke kathor shashan se bhi naaraaz the jo ki teji se fail rahaa tha or pashchimi sabhyta kaa prasar kar rahaa tha
 The British outlawed many of the customs of Hindus and Muslims at that time which were considered antisocial by the British
 isamen sati pratha par roak lagaana shaamil tha
 It is worth noting here that the Sikhs had stopped this long ago and the famous social reformer of Bengal, King Rammohan Roy was campaigning in favor of discontinuing the practice
 in kanoonon ne samaaj ke kuch pakshon mukhyatah bengal main krodh utpann kar diya
 The British abolished child marriage and also prohibited female feticide
 angrejon dwaara thagi kii samaapti bhi kii gai parantu yah sandeh abhi bhi bana hua he ki thag ek dharmik samudaay tha yaa keval saadhaaran dakaiton kaa samudaay
 The British judicial system was considered unjust to Indians
 san 1853 main britain ke pradhanmantri lord abradin ne prashasnic seva ko bharatiyon ke liye khol diya parantu kuch prabud bharatiyon ke hisaab se yah sudhaar paryaapt nahin tha
 The officers of the company were empowered with a number of appeals against Indians in courts
 company bharatiyon par baari kar bhi lagaati thi jise na chukaane kii sthiti main unki sampatti adhigrahit kar lee jaati thi
 Modernization efforts of the company were viewed with suspicion in traditional Indian society
 logo ne mana ki railway jo bambai se sarvapratham chalaa ek daanav he or logo par vipatti laayegaa
 But many historians also believe that these reforms have been exaggerated because the company did not have the means to implement these reforms and their influence away from Calcutta was negligible
 1857 ke vidroh kaa ek pramukh kaaran company dwaara bharatiyon kaa aarthik shoshan bhi tha
 The policies of the company completely ended India's traditional economy
 in nitiyon ke kaaran bahut se kisaan, karigar, shramik or kalakaar kangaal ho gayi
 Along with them the situation of the landlords and big farmers also got worse
 san 1813 main company ne ek tarafa mukt vyapaar kii niti apana lee iske antargat britani vyapaariyon ko aayaat karne kii puri chhot mil gayi, paramparaagat takanic se bani hui bhartiya vasteen iske saamne tik nahin saki or bhartiya shahari hastshilp vyapaar ko acolpaneey kshati hui
 With the arrival of the railway service, small enterprises in the rural areas were also destroyed
 rail seva ne britani vyapaariyon ko dur daraaj ke gaavon tak pahunch de di
 The textile industry suffered the most
 iske saath loha vyapaar, bartan, kaanch, kaagaj, dhaatu, bandook, jahaaj or rangareji ke udyogon ko bhi bahut kshati hui
 In the 18th and 19th centuries, Indian exports came to an end due to import tax and many barriers in Britain and Europe
 parmparik udyogon ke nasht hone or saath saath aadhunik udyogon kaa vikaas na hone kii kaaran yah sthiti or bhi visham ho gayi
 The general public has no means other than farming
 kheti karne vaale kisaano kii haalat bhi kharaab thi
 In the beginning of British rule, the peasants were left at the mercy of the zamindars, who greatly increased the rent and started exploiting the peasants by forced labor and other methods
 company ne kheti ke sudhaar par bahut kam kharch kiya or adhiktar lagaan company ke kharchon ko puraa karne main prayog hota tha
 In the event of crop failure, the moneylenders loaned the farmers more interest and cheated the illiterate farmers in many ways
 britani kanoon vyavastha ke antargat bhoomi hastantaran vaid ho jane ke kaaran kisaanon ko apni bhoomi se bhi haath dhonaa padataa tha
 Due to these problems there was dissatisfaction among every section of the society
 san 1848 or 1856 ke bich lard dalhoji ne doctrin ouf laps ke kanoon ke antargat anek rajyon par adhikaar kar liya
 According to this theory, a state, territory or area of british influence will become subject to the company, if the king of the region dies without permission or the ruler is disqualified in the eyes of the company

 Pneumonia often starts as an upper respiratory tract infection and then moves to the lower respiratory tract
 virus fefdon tak bhinn-bhinn maarg se pahunch sakate hai
 Respiratory syncytial viruses are usually infected when people touch contaminated objects and then their eyes or nostrils
 anya virus janit sankraman tab hote hai jab vaayu main faili sandooshit maheen boonden munh yaa ankhon ke raste shwasan kar lee jaati hai
 Once it reaches the upper airways, the virus makes its way into the lungs, from where the airways, alveoli or lungs enter the cells associated with the pencima
 kuch virus jaise ki chechak yaa herpis cimplex rakt ke madhyam se fefdon tak pahunchate hai
 Cells of varying degrees may die due to lung invasion

 Half of normal people have these small organisms enter during sleep
 jabaki gale main hameshaa bacteria hote hai, sankramak sambhaavnaaon vaale vahaan par keval kuch hi samay tak kuch vishesh paristhitiyon main rah pate hai
 a small amount of this type of bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Ligionella pneumophila, reaches the lungs through contaminated fine droplets circulating in the air
 bacteria rakt dwaara fail sakate hai
 Once they reach the lungs, bacteria can enter the space between the cells and the alveoli, where macrophages and neutrophils attempt to inactivate the bacteria
 neutrophil cytokine mukt karte hai jo pratiraksha tantra ko saamaanya rup se sakriy karata he
 This causes symptoms such as fever, chills, and fatigue caused by common bacterial pneumonia

 Therefore, the leaders of these three countries together called for Panchsheel
 panchasheel ne antarrashtriya sambandhon kii saidhantik va yatharth kaaryvaayiyon main rachanaatmak yogadan kiya
 Former Indian President Narayanan discussed the importance of Panchsheel in this way
 panchasheel kaa aaj bhi baari mahatv he
 It has been the guiding standard for settling relations between countries for a long time
 ek shantipurna duniya kii sthapana karne ke liye panchasheel kaa karyavyan karnaa atyant mahatvapurn he
 It is clear from the history and international reality that Panchsheel's vitality is very strong
 use vyapak janata dwaara sweekaar kiya ja chukaa he
 Countries adopting different social systems accept the ideology of Panchsheel
 logon ne maan liya he ki panchasheel shanti va sahyog ke liye laabhadaayak he or antarrashtriya kanoonon va maapdandon se purna rup se mail khaataa hai
 Changes are happening in today's world
 panchasheel kaa prachaar-prasar aaj kii kuch samasyaon ke hal ke liye bahut laabhadaayak he
 Therefore, Panchsheel is still the basis of a peaceful world order
 us kaa aaj bhi baari arth va mahatv he or bhavishya main bhi rahegaa
 Searching for peace and development is the same desire of the people of the present world
 panchasheel kii shanti va vikaas kii vichaardhaara ne antarrashtriya sambandhon ke swasth vikaas ko aage badhaayaa he or bhavishya main bhi vah ek shantipurna, sthir, nyaaypurna va uchit nayi antarrashtriya vyavastha kii sthapana main ahm bhoomika adaa karegi
 In order to further develop the relationship between the two countries, former Indian President Narayanan in 2000, during a state visit to China, suggested the convening of a forum of eminent personalities from India and China in talks with former Chinese President Chiang Jin Min

 In 2003, Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee visited China and issued a joint manifesto with Chinese Prime Minister One Cha Pao

 In this way, the Government of India, for the first time, openly highlighted its stand on the problem of Tibet through a formal document, which received praise from the Chinese government
 is ke alaava, china va bharat ke bich seemaa samasya bhi lambe arase se ansulajhi rahi he
 To solve this problem, China and India held talks in several phases from December 1981 and achieved some progress among them
 varsh 2003 main purv bhartiya pradhanmantri shri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne china kii safal yatra kii

 Former Chinese Ambassador to India Chyo Kang said, "we should depart from a forward-looking stance towards the problem left behind by history
" china sarkaar ne seemaa samasya ke hal kii sakriy rukh apanaai he
 China hopes that the appropriate and justifiable methods accepted by both should be explored through friendly dialogue, in the spirit of mutual reconciliation and trust
 vishwaas he ki jab donon paksh aapasi vishwaas, sulah va riyaayat dene kii abhilaashaa se prasthaan karenge to china-bharat seemaa samasya ke hal ke tareekon kii khoj kar hi lee jaaegi
 At this time, China and India are engaged in their peaceful development

 There is widespread agreement in both on international affairs

 alag-alag samay par or vibhinn deshon main kaagaj ke kai maanak aakaar die gaye hai, lekin aaj ek vyapak antarrashtriya iesao maanak or uttari america main istemaal kiye jane vaale ek sthaneey maanak kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The paper's international standard is based on ISO 216, the German DIN 476 standard for this
 paper ke sabhi iesao maanak aakaar 2 ke vargamul ke ek pahalu vaale anupaat yaa lagbhag 1:1
4142 par aadhaarit hai
 The basic A0 size of the paper is defined with an area of one square meter
 do ke vargamul ke die gaye pahalu ke anupaat ke saath, iskaa matlab kagaz kaa ek aisa tukdaa he jiskaa lanbaa hissaa ek meter guna do ke vargamul kaa vargamul he or chota hissaa is maan ke vipareet he
 When converted to millimeters, the A0 size of the paper is 841 x 1,189 millimeters
 A1, A2, A3 kii shrinkhalaa or isi tarah ke kagaz ke nirantar aakaaron kii paribhaasha purvavarti kagaz ke aakaar ko lambaai vaale hisse kii ore se aadha karte hue di jaati he
 The most commonly used paper size is A4
 is pranali kaa mukhya laabh isaki scalling he: agar √2 ke pahalu anupaat ke ek shit ko iske sabase chote hisse ke samanaantar do baraabar hisson main baanta jaataa he to donon aadhe-aadhe hisson kaa pahalu anupaat phir se √2 hi hoga
 kisi bhi aakaar ke mude hue brosharon ko iske agle bade aakaar ke shiton kaa upyog kar banaaya ja saktaa he, jaise ki A5 broshar banane ke liye A4 shiton kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 This system allows scaling from one size to another without compromising aspect ratio - as is done by office photocopying machines, ie increasing A4 to A3 or A3 to A4
 Similarly, two sheets of A4 size can be truncated without any kind of cutoff or margin and can be fitted in only one sheet
 vajan kaa hisaab-kitaab lagaana bhi aasaan ho jaataa he: ek 80 gram prati varg meter aakaar ke paper se bane ek maanak A4 shit kaa vajan 5 gram hota he, jisase koi bhi iske vajan - or isse sambandhit dak kii dar - kaa hisaab isamen istemaal kiye gaye shiton kii sankhya kii gananaa kar aasaani se laga saktaa he
 The advantages of basing the size of a paper at an aspect ratio of √2 were already mentioned in 1786 by the German scientist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg
 beesvin sadi kii shuruyaat main dow walter porstman ne lictenberg ke vichaar ko kagaz ke alag-alag aakaaron kii ek samuchit pranali main badal diya
 porstman kii pranali ko 1922 main germany main ek diien maanak ke rup main kaagaj ke anya praroopon kii ek vyapak vividhta ke sthaan par pesh kiya gaya
 In Germany even today, the paper size is called "DIN A4" in everyday use
 diien 476 maanak kaa vistaar jaldi kii anya deshon main ho gaya or dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke chhidane se pehle nimnlikhit deshon ne ise apana liya tha: During World War II this standard was adopted by Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil; And then it spread to other countries: 1975 tak itane adhik deshon ne is german pranali kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar diya tha ki ise ek iesao maanak ke saath-saath sanyukt raashtra ke aadhikarik dastauez ke swaroop main sthapit kar diya gaya
 By 1977, the A4 size had become the standard paper format of 88 countries out of 148
 aaj is maanak ko sanyukt rajya america or canada ko chhodkar duniya ke sabhi deshon ne apana liya he
 American letter formats are still in common use in Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina, Chile and the Philippines, despite their officially adopting the ISO standard
 a shrinkhalaa ke alaava kam istemaal hone vaali ek b shrinkhalaa bhi maujuud he
 Area of B series sheets is the geometric mean of continuous sheets of a series
 isiliye B1 A0 or A1 ke bich kaa aakaar he jiskaa kshetrafal 0
707 varg meter he
 As a result, the width of B0 is one meter and the other sizes of the b series are half, one quarter or other proportion of the width of one meter
 haalanki karyaalay sambandhi kaaryon main aam taur par iskaa upyog kam hota he lekin vishesh avasaron par iskaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Many posters use B-series paper or a close ratio such as 50 cm × 70 cm; The B5 is a relatively common choice for books
 b shrinkhalaa kaa istemaal liphaafon or passporton ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 The c series is used only for envelopes and is defined in ISO 269
 c shrinkhalaa kii shiton kaa kshetrafal usee sankhya kii a or b shrinkhalaa ke shiton ke kshetrafalon kaa jyamitiya madhyamaan he, udhaaharan ke liye, ek C4 shit kaa kshetrafal ek A4 shit or ek B4 shit ke kshetrafalon kaa jyamitiya madhyamaan he
 This means that C4 is slightly larger than A4; And B4 is slightly larger than C4
 iskaa vyaavhaarik upyog yah he ki A4 kaagaj par likhaa ek patr ek C4 lipaphe ke andar feet baithta he or ek C4 lipapha ek B4 lipaphe ke andar feet baithta he
 The following are the tolerances specified in the standard: german maanak DIN 476 1922 main prakashit hua tha or ise a tathaa b aakaaron ke liye mul aakaar mana jaataa he
 It differs from its international successor in two details: DIN 476, A0 se bade formats ke liye ek vistaar pradaan karata he, jise ek prifiks factor se darshaya jaataa he
 It specifically depicts two formats - 2A0 whose area is twice that of A0 and 4A0, whose area is four times that of A0: diien 476, adhik kathor sahishnutaaon ko bhi nirdisht karata he: The Swedish standard SIS 014711 normalized the ISO system by combining the D, E, f and g formats with the system of A, b and c formats
 Its d format sits between a b format and the next larger a format
 
 baaki bache praaroop in sabhi praroopon ke bich is tarah feet baithte hai ki A4, E4, C4, G4, B4, F4, D4, H4, A3 praroopon kaa anukram ek jyamitiya vikaas hota he, jisamen ek aakaar se agle aakaar main ayaamon kaa vikaas 2 ke 1 / 16wein bhaag ke ek pahalu ke aadhaar par hota he
 However, the SIS 014711 standard does not define any size between the d format and the next larger a format

 JIS defines two main ranges of paper sizes
 jeies A-shrinkhalaa iesao A-shrinkhalaa ke samaan he, lekin thode alag bhinnataaon ke saath
 B-shrinkhalaa ke kaagaj kaa kshetrafal isse sambandhit A-aakaar ke kagaz kaa 1
5 guna he, isiliye lambaai kaa anupaat sambandhit A-shrinkhalaa ke kagaz kii lambaai kaa lagbhag 1
22 guna he
 The aspect ratio of the paper is similar to the ratio of A-series paper
 a or b donon shrinkhalaa ke kaagaj japan, taiwan or china main bade paimaane par uplabdh hai or zyaadaatar photocopiyaron ke paas kam se kam A4 or A3, B4 evam B5 main se koi bhi kagaz maujuud he

 The current standard sizes of papers in the US, Canada and Mexico are a subset of the traditional sizes below
 "letters", "legal", "lager" or "tabloid" aakaar dainik gatividhiyon ke liye ab tak aam taur par sabase adhik istemaal kiye jate rahe hai
 The exact dimensions of the "letter" shaped paper are lost in the original traditions and are not well recorded

 That is why Ronald Reagan asked the US government to adopt the regular letter size
 The 8 inch × 10 1⁄2 inch size is still commonly used in spiral-bound notebooks and similar formats

 If the electron is considered to be an orbit in a complete cycle and the energy is constant, the electron will rapidly spiral into the nucleus with the following time: a0 bohar trigya he or r0 shastreey electron trigya he
 If this is true, then all atoms will collapse instantly, although atoms begin to freeze

 Ecological footprint is a measure of human demand on Earth's ecosystems
 yah insaan kii maang kii tulana, prithvi kii paristhitiki ke punarutpaadan karne kii kshamta se karata he
 It refers to the amount of biological productive land and marine area needed to reproduce and absorb the waste consumed by human populations and to make them harmless
 iskaa prayog karte hue yah anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki agar prayek vyakti ek nishchit jivan style apanaae, to maanavtaa kii sahaayta ke liye prithvi ke kitne hisse kii zarurat hogi
 Mankind's total ecological footprint for 2006 was estimated to be 1

 While the term ecological footprint is widely used, its methods of measurement differ
 haalanki gananaa ke maanak ab zyada tulanaatmak or sangat parinaam dene vaale ban kar ubhar rahe hai
 The first academic publication about the ecological footprint was in 1992 by William Rees
 paristhitik padchihn kii avadharana or gananaa kii vidhi 1990-1994 main canada ke vankuvar main british colombia vishvavidhyalay main ris ke paryvekshan main methis vaikaranajel ke phd shodh prabandh main viksit kii gai
 Originally, Wackernagel and Rees called the concept "approved carrying capacity"
 is avadharana ko or sulabh banane ke liye ris ne "paristhitik padchihn" naam ko pesh kiya, jo ek computer takanisian dwaara unke nae computer ke "mej par chote padchihn" kii prashansa se prerit tha
 In early 1996, Wackernagel and Rees published the book Our Ecological Footprint: Reducing Human Impact on the Earth
 paristhitik padchihn vishleshan, prakruti par maanav maang kii tulana, jeevamandal ke sansadhano ke punarutpaada or sevaayen uplabdh karaane kii kshamta se karti he
 It does this using the prevalent technology under which it assesses the biologically productive land and sea area required by mankind to consume resources and the absorption of waste generated by them
 ek surveykshan ke ant main padchihn mulyon ko koyala, bhojan, awaas or samagriyon tathaa sevaaon ke liye vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, saath hi saath prithvi kii kul padchihn sankhya jo upbhog ke us str par vishwa kii jansankhya ko banaaye rakhane ke liye aavashyak he
 This approach can also be applied to an activity such as manufacturing a product or driving a car
 yah sansaadhan lekha, jivan chakra vishleshan ke samaan hi he jisamen urja, jaev eendhan,, nirmaan saamagree, jal or duusare sansadhano ko bhoomi ke samanyikrut maap main parivartit kiya jaataa he, jise 'vaishvik hectare' kaha jaataa he
 Per capita ecological footprint is a means to compare consumption and lifestyle and to check nature's ability to provide this consumption
 yah upkaran, koi desh apni seemaa main uplabdh chizon kaa kis had tak zyada upyog karata he yaa desh kii jivan style kis had tak vaishvik str par anukaraniya hogi iskaa pareekshan kar, rajshasan niti ko suchit kar saktaa he
 The footprint can also be a useful tool for educating people about chargeability and over-consumption aimed at improving individual behavior
 paristhitik padchihn kaa istemaal is baat par tark karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he ki kai vartmaan jivan sheliyaan poshneey nahin hai
 Such global comparisons clearly show irregularities in the use of resources in the early twenty-first century on this planet
 2006 main duniya bhar main ausat prati vyakti jaivik utpaadak kshetra lagbhag 1
8 vaishvik hectare prati vyakti tha
 The US footprint was 9
0 gha per capita and Switzerland's 5
6 gha per capita while China had 1
8 gha per capita
 WWF kaa daawa he ki grah par maanav padchihn jaivakshmata se 20% zyada ho gaya he
 Wackernagel and Rees originally estimated that the biological capacity available to the 6 billion people on Earth at that time was 1
3 hectares per capita, lower than the 1
8 global hectares published for 2006, because neither global hectares nor preliminary studies have shown Bio-productivity of marine areas was included

 Nowadays ecological footprint is widely used as an indicator of environmental sustainability all over the world
 ye puri arthvyavastha ke sansadhano ke upyog ke maapan or prabandhan ke liye bhi istemaal kiye ja sakate hai
 They can also be used to explore the stability of individual lifestyles, goods and services, organizations, industry sectors, neighborhoods, cities, regions and countries

 The National Accounting Committee of the Global Footprint System has also published a research agenda on how to improve this method

 Examples include how to calculate the maritime area, how to account for fossil fuels, how to account for nuclear power, what data sources were used, global numbers or localities when particular areas are taken into account When the numbers should be used, how the area of biodiversity should be included and how imports / exports should be kept accountable

 Computation of ecological footprint for densely populated areas, such as a city or small country with relatively large populations - for example New York and Singapore, respectively - can give rise to the notion of "parasites" about these populations

 Krishna Baldev Vaid, considered among the most important writers in modern prose literature of Hindi, has made an outstanding contribution in the field of drama and translation besides diary writing, story and novel genres

 " vaidji kaa rachana-sansar bahut bada he- vipul or vividh anubhavon se bharaa
 It has many new, unique, exceedingly original and totally fresh uses of language and style for Hindi
 hamaare samay ke ek zaruri or bade lekhakon main se ek vaid ji naitikta, sheel ashleel or bhashaa jaise prashnon ko le kar keval apane chintan hi nahin balki apane samooche lekhan main ek aise murtibhanjak rachanashilpi hai, jo vidhaon kii sarhadon ko behad ytnpurvak todta he
 It is not a chaotic sabotage in the interest of Hindi, a well-thought-out initiative - full of creative self-confidence
 asweekrutiyon kaa khatra uthaa kar bhi jin thode se lekhakon ne apane shilp, kathy or kehane ke andaaz ko har kriti main praayah nayepan se sanvaara he vaison main vaidji bahudhaa apratyaashit dhab-dhang se apni rachanaaon main ek alag vivaadee-swar sa nazar aate hai
 Vinod and Vit, Urdu dialecticality, Anuprasi Chhata, Tuk, consistency within meaninglessness, modernity - all these are found in the language of Vaid Ji
 nirbhik prayog-paryutsukata vaid ji ko manushya ke bheetar ke andheron-ujaalon, jivan-mrityu, sukhon-dukhon, ashankaon, dar, sanshay, anasthaa, ub, uktaahat, vaasanaon, sapanom, ashankaon; sab ke bheetar antarangta jhaankane kaa avkaash detii he
 In search of an unseen light in the darkness of man's soul, he is the only companion of his way - unique and valuable
 hemanth shesh ne unki katha-yatra par jo sampadakeey-tippanee likhi thi, use yahan uddhrut karnaa praasangik hoga-"krishna baldev vaid hindi ke aise aadhunik rachanaakaar hai, videsh main pravaas ke lambe daur ke baavjood jinamein bhashaa or lekhkeey-sanskaar ke bataur ek hindustani kaa hi man bachaa-basaa rahaa he
 In each of his novel-works, if he appears different from the first, even after the unbroken Indian monotony of the price-vision, then it is only a retrospective of his experience and creative-richness that tells us in a new way every time It has an unwavering pledge to bring both our society and our time together in newly identified linguistic relationships
 aashcharya kii baat nahin ki unki adhikansh rachanaaen pashchim ke parivesh lokel or maansikta ko apni sarjanaatmak-prerana nahin maanati, jaisaa kuch suparichit hindi kathakaron ne lagaataar kiya he
 On the contrary, Krishna Baldev Vaid, the conscious middle-class mind of our own country, while deliberately protecting himself from the so-called effects of migration, recreates his own memories, concerns and ironic conditions, which are a changing society and Modern humans are roaming inside
 ye smritiyaan ho sakati hai- uchaat akelepan ke avsaad kii, asuraksha kii bhaavana se upji swaabhaavik hataasha kii, sambandhon kii jatiltaaon or unke khokhalepan kii, vidambnaatmak sthitiyon jujhate stri-purushon kii, uktaahat ke bauddhik-vishleshan kii

 The writer, in whose light of literary explorations and observations, we can see ourselves from such extraordinary angles, which can only be possible through a single composition
 unka lekhan ek chir-visthapit lekhak kii tarkapriyata kaa bhashya he, anyon ke liye asuvidhajanak or rahasyamay, par swayan lekhak ke liye athmiya, janaa-pahachaanaa, antarang bhashaa kaa ghar
 yah kahana paryaapt or sach nahin he ki vaid apni kritiyon main mahaz ek hindustani lekhak hai, balki usase zyada vah ek aise vivekshil aadhunik lekhak hai, jo apni bauddhik-prakharata, dridhtaa or avichlit manyataon ke bal par hindi sahitya ke parichit katha-dhang ko todate, marodate or badalte hai
 His experiment is Ajsara and uninterested in the popular
 vah apni sharton par abhivyakti ke liye sannaddh ek aise lekhak hai, jinke liye agar mahatvapurn he to sirf us lekhkeey-asmita, soch or bhashaai vaiyaktikta kii raksha, jo unhen apane dhang ke 'form' kaa aisa kathashilpi banaati he-jo aalochana ke kisi suvidhajanak-khaanche main nahin antata
 unka sara lekhan sarlikrut vyakhyaaon lokapriy-samiksha dhang ke liye jaise ek chunauti he
 Identification and re-evaluation of the writings of his time like him is necessary
 keval isliye nahin ki aise rachanakaaron par apekshaakrit kam likhaa gaya he or apekshaakrit kam sargarbhit bhi, par isliye bhi ki ek gahari naitik zimmedaari us samskruti-samaaj kii bhi he hi jiske bich rah kar krishna baldev vaid jaise lekhak chupchaap dhang se use lagaataar sampann or samrudh banaate aa rahe hai
 For his role of Hemant Sesha in his story collection 'badchal Beevi Ka Island', see- kavi or ek i-patrika janaki pul ke sampadak prabhaat ranjan ne vaid par jo tippanee likhi thi, vah kuch yon thi-" Coming together at the age of 85, two beautiful books of the stories of famous Hindi writer and novelist Krishna Baldev Vaid, can be said to be pleasant
 sukhad isliye bhi kyonki inamen se ek ‘khaali kitaab kaa jaadu’ unki nai kahaniyon kaa sankalan he
 The second compilation is 'pravas Ganga', which can also be called the collection of their representative stories, but not completely
 These books, published from penguin-yatra Publications, have once again drawn attention to the writings of Krishna Baldev Vaid
 krishna baldev vaid kii hindi katha-sahitya main apni alag li rahi he, isiliye apana alag makaam bhi rahaa he
 In the days when the marking of external reality in Hindi literature was considered to be the biggest formula of being a 'hit' in fiction, at the same time, he wrote a novel like 'his childhood', which undoubtedly gave a different identity to his writing
 Through his writings, he in a way created the antithesis of the mainstream Hindi story being told in which the emphasis is on subtlety rather than grossness
 kahaniyaan unke liye man kii duniya main gahare utarane kaa madhyam he, astitv se jude sawaalon se jujhane kaa, unako samajhane kaa
 nitant saarvajanik hote kathajagat main unki kahaniyon ne niztaa ke us spes kaa nirmaan kiya, jo hindi main ek alag pravriti kii tarah se pahachaani gai
 It is still recognized today
 unki nai kahaniyon ke sangrah ‘khaali kitaab kaa jaadu’ kii baat karen to usamen bhi unki vahi li pahachaani ja sakati he, jisamen chetan ke nahin avchetan ke varnan hai, unki kahaniyon main koi suniyojit kathatmakataa nahin dikhaai detii, balki jahaan kathatmakataa aati he to vah parody kaa shakl le leti he
 His story 'kalingasena and Somprabha's bizarre friendship' compiled in 'pravas Ganga' can be mentioned in this context, which in itself is a rewriting of a story of 'kathasaritsagar'
 punarlekhan ke kram main usamen jo comic kaa put aata he, vah usamen samakaleenta kaa bodh paidaa karata he
 In this writing has created a parody of the narrative tradition on the one hand which he has denied in his writing and on the other hand the modernist importance of being original is broken by rewriting
 kuch bhi moulik nahin hota
 borkhez ne likhaa he ki duniya banane vaale ne jis din duniya banaai thi usee din ek kahani likh di thi, har daur ke lekhak usee kahani ko duharaata rahata he
 No story is original, whatever it is is a copy of the original
 ‘khaali kitaab kaa jaadu’ main kul nau kahaniyaan he or unamem kathanak ko lekar, katha-shilp ko lekar unki vahi prayogshiltaa mukhar dikhaai detii he jise unke lekhan kii pahchaan ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 He is the author of storylessness, not of fiction, but of incidents, not of incidents
 jise hindi kahani kii mukhyadhara kaha jaataa he uskaa spasht nishedh unki kahaniyon main dikhaai detaa he, us samjik yatharthwaad kaa unhone apane lekhan ke madhyam se lagaataar nishedh kiya he, lekin aisa nahin he ki unke lekhan main saamaajikta nahin he
 They are not just made molds, they are typical of life

 ’ yah kahani vidha kaa ek tarah se vistaar he, usko vimarsh ke kareeb dekhne kii ek koshish he

 Rather, he also urges failure to be viewed as a value
 sangrah main ek kahani ‘vifaldaas kaa lakva’ he, jise is sandarbh main dekha-samajha ja saktaa he
