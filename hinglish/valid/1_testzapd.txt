 He spent 26 months in jail during the Quit India Movement
 vah 22 disambar 1970 se 2 june 1971 tathaa 24 june 1977 se 21 april 1979 ke dauraan do baar bihar ke mukhyamantri pad par rahe
 He is called a mass hero

 Socially backward but born in a new caste to achieve the noble goal of service, this great man also lived politics with the spirit of public service
 unki seva bhaavana ke kaaran hi unhen jan nayak kaha jaataa tha, vah sadaa garibon ke haq ke liye ladate rahe
 While the Chief Minister, he gave 27 percent reservation to the backward
 unka jivan logon ke liya adarsh se kam nahin

 Freedom fighter Karpoori Thakur has been an MLA continuously since 1952, but he did not even build a house for himself
 karpuri thakur ne saaf manaa kar diya
 tab ke ek vidhayak ne unase yah bhi kaha tha ki jameen le lijie
anyathaa aap nahin rahiega to aapkaa bal-baccha kahaan rahegaa? karpuri thakur ne kaha ki apane gaanv main rahegaa
 Karpoori Thakur was the Chief Minister of Bihar in 1970-71
 He was to go to a village in Ranchi to see the groom
 Till then Bihar was not partitioned
 Karpoori Thakur did not go by government car and went there by taxi
 The wedding took place in his ancestral village Pitounjia in Samastipur district
 Karpoori Thakur wanted the wedding to be held in the Deoghar temple, but his wife got married in the village on the insistence of him
 Karpoori Thakur had not even invited any member of his cabinet to the wedding, even as he had instructed the officer concerned that no aircraft of the Bihar government, ie, Darbhanga or Saharsa on that day without the permission of the Chief Minister
 Will not land at the airport
 The airports near Pitunjia were there
 Today some of the so-called socialist leaders also make the wedding a 'convention'
 The illustrious officers and businessmen spend crores on the occasions of weddings of the ruling leaders
 patna ke kadam kuan sthit charkha samiti bhawan main, jahaan jepi rahete the,desh bhar se janata party ke bade netaa jute hue the

phir chandrashekhar apni seat se uthe
 unhone apane lambey kurte ko apane donon haathon se pakad kar saamne kii ore failaayaa
 vah baari-baari se vahaan baithe netaaon ke paas jaakar kehane lage ki aap karpuri ji ke kurta fund main daan kiijie
 turant kuch sau rupye ekatra ho gaye
use samet kar chandrashekhar ji ne karpuri ji ko thamaya or kaha ki isse apana kurta-dhoti hi kharidie
 koi doosraa kaam mat kijiega
 chehre par bina koi bhav laae karpuri thakur ne kaha, ‘ise main mukhyamantri raahat kosh main jamaa kara duungaa
’ That is, then Karpoori Thakur of the socialist movement was known for his simplicity and honesty, but few socialist leaders of today? Say less and understand more! karpuri ji kaa vaani par kathor niyantran tha
 He was a skilled artisan of the language
 unka bhaashan aadambar-rahit, ojasvi, utsahvardhak tathaa chintanaparak hota tha
 In order to speak bitter to bitter truths, he used to behave such words and sentences, which the opposition woke up, but could not say that Karpoori ji had insulted him
 unki aawaaj bahut hi khanakdaar or chunauteepurn hoti thi, lekin yah usee had tak satya, sanyam or samvednaa se bhi bharpoor hoti thi
 When someone tried to mislead Karpoori ji, he would get angry and his face would turn red with anger
 aise avasaron par ve kam hi bol pate the, lekin jo nahin bol pate the, vah sab unki ankhon main saaf-saaf jhalkane lagata tha
 Nevertheless, he never violated the Lakshmana lines of etiquette and decorum even in the most difficult of circumstances
 saamaanya, saral or sahaj jeevanstyli ke himachati karpuri thakur ji ko prarambh se hi saamaajik or raajnneetik antarvirodhon se jujhna padaa
 These contradictions were unique and disruptive
 hua yah ki aazaadee milane ke saath hi satta par congress kabiz ho gai
 In Bihar, the Congress was dominated by the upper castes
 ye oonchi jatiyaan satta kaa adhik se adhik swaad chakhne ke liye aapas main ladane lageen
 Instead of the party, vote banks were formed in the name of these castes
 san 1952 ke pratham aam chunaav ke baad congress ke bheetar kii kuch sankhya bahul pichhadi jatiyon ne bhi alag se ek gut bana daalaa, jiskaa naam rakhaa gaya ‘triveni sangh’
 Now this association also joined that Mahantaka
 sheeghra hi iske bure nattejey saamne aane lage
 The black forces of numbers, muscle and money power began to control politics and society
 raajnneetik dalon kaa swaroop badalane laga
 Faithful activists began to fall face down
 karpuri ji ne na keval is paristhiti kaa datakar saamana kiya, balki in pravritiyon kaa jamkar bhandaphod bhi kiya
 Many other evils had arisen within the Congress across the country, hence the slogan of non-congressism under the leadership of Dr
 Ram Manohar Lohia was given in the general election of 1967 to elect him
 congress parajeet hui or bihar main pehali baar gaiyr congressi sarkaar bani
 The participation of common people and backwards increased in power
 karpuri ji us sarkaar main up mukhyamantri bane
 His height grew
 use tab or oonchai mili jab ve 1977 main janata party kii vijay ke baad bihar ke mukhyamantri bane
 What happened was that for the first time in the 1977 elections, the backward class had a decisive edge over political power
 magar prashasan-tantra par unka niyantran nahin tha
 Therefore, the demand for reservation in government jobs started to be loud
 karpuri ji ne mukhyamantri kii haisiyat se ukt maang ko samvidhan sammat maanakar ek formula nirdhaarit kiya or kaafii vichaar-vimarsh ke baad use lagu bhi kar diya
 There was a lot of hue and cry between the parties and the opposition
 alag-alag samoohon ne ek-duusare par jativaadee hone ke aarope bhi lagaae
 But Karpoori ji's personality remained secure
 unka kad or bhi ooncha ho gaya
 Due to his policy and intention, he became the leader of the society
 ve raajnneeti main congress party kii raajnneetik chaalon ko bhi samajhate the or samaajawaadee kheme ke netaaon kii mahatvakankshaon ko bhi
 They used to take a flexible approach to form a government and would form a government by tying up with any party, but if the work was not done as per their wish, they would have broken the alliance
 yahi vajah he ki unke dost or dushman donon ko hi unke raajnneetik faisalon ke bare main anischitata bani rahati thi

 The Nalopakhyana of Mahabharata is the root of this epic
 is granth ke do bhaag hai- purv or uttar
 There are 11-11 cantos in both
 At the end of this book it is not specified that 'the book is finished' - this is why the text is incomplete

 The great poet of this great epic of Brihattrayi, was a great scholar of justice, mimamsa, yogasastra etc
 and was the great Advaita Vedanti of logical method

 The basic premise of this epic is the "nalopakhyana" of "mahabharata"
 mul katha ke mul rup main yathaavashyak parivartan bhi yatra-tatra kiya gaya he
 It seems that the popularity of this mythology has made it a folklore since ancient times

 Shringarparikar's paintings have also added to that expansion

 It seems that the poet's wisdom does not get tired of assessing a presentation one after another by the unprepared

 More than the Magh poet, Shri Harsha has greatly increased it with the addition of poetic performance of poetry, which has greatly increased the poetry of the short story

 They wanted that an international institution was needed to keep the Vienna Agreement permanent and to maintain a stable peace system in Europe
 unki yah dharna thi ki yadi yudhon ke dauraan paraspar sahyog or sadbhaavnaaen ho sakati hai to shaantikaal main bhi yah sambhav he
 Realizing this international responsibility, two schemes were presented - Holy Union, European Joint System

 He considered the French Revolution as inhuman and destructive
 usne ghoshnaa kii ki sabhi raja paraspar ek-duusare ko bandhu samajhen or apni praja ko santan tulya samaj kar us par shashan karen
 This meant that the rulers of Europe should rule religion, justice and prajatlata as the basis
 isliye jaar elexander ne 26 disambar 1815 ko uparokt vichaaron ko ek prastaav ke rup main rakhaa
 Austria and Prasha agreed to this
 britain or pope ko chhodkar sheeghra hi anya deshon ke pratinidhiyon ne bhi is par sahmati pradaan kar di
 Thus on the passing of this resolution an institution called "holy Association" was established
 iske siddhanth nimnlikhit hai- This sacred union could not achieve any special success and achievement in Europe, as none other than Jar Alexander tried for its meaning and success

 Although the goals of this holy union were not evil, it was a failed attempt both as a political instrument and as a diplomatic instrument

 Algebra generally refers to the science in which numbers are represented by letters
 parantu sankriya chihn vahi rahete hai, jinka prayog ankaganit main hota he
 Suppose we want to write that the area of a rectangle is equal to the product of its length and width, then we will represent this fact as follows- bijaganiti ke aadhunik sanketwad kaa vikaas kuch shatabdi purv hi prarambh hua he; parantu samikarnon ke saadhan kii samasya bahut puraani he
 2000 years before Christ, people used to solve equations with speculation
 isa se 300 varsh purv tak hamaare purvaj samikarnon ko shabdon main likhane lage the or jyamiti vidhi dwaara unke hal gyaat kar lete the
 Today, algebra does not consist only of equations, polynomials, continuous fractions, infinite product, number sequences, forms, arithmetic, series etc
 are studied in many cases
 bijganit ko praayah nimnlikhit shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he- In the case of algebra in which undetermined equations are studied, its old name is 'kuttak'

 longinus paramparaagat rup se "kavy main udaatt tatv" naamak kriti kaa rachanaakaar mana jaataa he
 The effects of good writing are discussed in this work
 longinus kaa asli naam gyaat nahin he
 He was a teacher of Greek Kavyalochan
 uskaa kaal pehali se lekar teesri shadi tak hone kaa anumaan he
 Longinus has proposed this theory considering the elements that make poetry better
 ve udaatt ko kavy ko shreshth banane vaala tathaa kavi ko pratishtha dilaane vaala tatv maanate hai
 It is rooted in the dignity of lofty great ideas organized ornamentation plan, aristocratic designation and influence
 ve vagadambar baleyata or bhavanumbar ko udaadtta main baadhak tatv maanate hai
 Just as in Indian poetry, different views have been made about the nature of poetry and its soul, similarly in the field of western criticism, different thinkers have discovered the origin of poetry or literature in different eras
 plato ne anukaran ko sahitya kaa mul tatva mana
 Pallavan Aristotle did this with his vision and accepted Virechan as the object of literature
 isi prakaar lonzinus kaa udaatt siddhanth he
 Through this theory, he has made it clear that no artwork or poetry can be a masterpiece without a sublime element
 shreshth vahi he jisamen rachayita kaa gahan chintan or anubhutiyaan rahati hai
 This feeling of the creator makes the creation great due to its greatness, sublime, grandeur or dignity
 rachana yaa kriti shilp ke dwaara abhivyakti paati he; kintu udaatt rachana kaa lekhak apni rachana main shilp ke soundarya kii adhik chintaa na karke usamen nihit anubhuti ko hi sabal banane kaa ytn karata he
 Acharya Longines, who presents this sublime principle
 inkaa unani bhashaa kaa naam longinus tathaa angreji bhashaa main uccharit 'lonzinus' he
 His work is titled 'perihutsuus', which was translated into English as 'on the Sublime'
 isi ko hindi main udaatt kii sangya di gai
 Its book is the main text of Western literature
 lonzinus ne udaatt kii paribhaasha or uskaa saamaanya parichay jis rup main diya he usase prathit hota he ki unke samay main yah shabd itnaa adhik prachlit ho gaya tha ki unhone iskaa vistrut parichay dene kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin samajhi
 Still, clarifying the nature of the sublime, he said this much- arthath abhivyakti kii vishistataa or shreshthata kaa naam udaatt he
 By aiming at this, Hindi critics have accepted that the lofty element in a composition is expressed by appropriate and dignified word-legislation, a rhetorical scheme of impulse, and composition-legislation
 lonzinus ne kavy ke udaatt ko vaktruta se ekadam bhinn bataaya he, kyonki kavy main shrotaaon par udaatt kaa prabhaav tanmayata ke rup main hota he, pravartan ke rup main nahin
 For this reason, in the sight of Longinus, there is a grand poem which, due to the joyousness, makes us so engrossed and attuned to reach such a high sense where the subject of the light is illuminated like electric light
 is drushti se lonzinus ko anandatirek or vishwanath ke vigalit-vedyantar main bahut kuch samya dekha ja saktaa he
 In the form of the sublime, both the psychological and the behavioral aspects were exposed in Longinus
 isi se unhone ek ore udaatt ke aantarik tattvon kaa ullekh kiya he or duusari ore uske bahya paksh kii bhi vivechna kii he
 What is Sublime Basis? Is it based on the innate talent of the speaker or writer, or can it be considered by the rise of education or dependent on practice? Longinus has followed the Middle Way, considering these questions
 unke vichaar se udaatt na to sarvatha pratibha saapeksh he or na purnatah abhyaas-saapeksh
 In fact, the basis of the sublime is not one aspect, one quality or one tendency of the person but a glimpse of the entire personality behind it
 atah udaatt kaa sristaa udaatt vyaktitv hi ho saktaa he
 Only a person of great genius, high scholar and celebrity can be a sublime or an announcer
 lonzinus ke anusaar - ‘‘udaatt aatma kii mahanata kaa pratibimb he
 True sublime is attainable only in those whose consciousness is sublime and development oriented
 yah sarvatha swaabhaavik he ki jinke mastishk udaatt dharanaon se paripurna he unheen kii vaani se udaatt shabd zankrut ho sakate hai
 '' is prakaar udaatt kaa sambandh keval pratibha, adhyayan or bhashaa ke adhyayan se nahin, apitu vyakti ke samooche vyaktitv se he
 In conclusion uskaa prabhaav kramik nahin, aakasmik hota he or uske alolik alok se katha chamak uthati he
 Although the foundation of the sublime lies in the greatness of the personality of the litterateur, in order to bring the element of sublime into the composition, Loninus has discussed five sources - uparyukt paanchon tattvon main se pratham do janmajaat arthath kavi-pratibha ke ang hai or shesh teen kala sambandhi visheshtaayen hai
 The first place among the sources of the sublime is the importance of thought
 isi ko lonzinus ne shabd-bhed se aatma kii bhavyata bhi kaha he
 His clear statement is - "the soul of the sublime great is echoed
 ’’ yadi aatma kii yah mahatta naiysargik na ho to utkrisht vichaaron dwaara use praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Great words come out of his mouth in which thoughts are deep and deep
 mahaan vichaaron se sampann, atmotthanayukt sahityakar hi udaatt-srijan kar sakate hai
 This is such a concept of Longinus, to which his concept of sublime effect is also connected
 udaatt kaa prabhaav atmatikraman hota he, anunayan nahin
 This belief specializes that soul-order is possible only with the graceful expression of grand and great ideas
 vastutah atmik mahanata udaatt srujana kii pehali shart he, isiilie udaatt kaa prabhaav bhi natikrup se kalyankari hi mana jayega
 Thus the effect of sublime literature should be considered to be good from both moral and artistic point of view
 is drushti se lonzinus or mahakavi milton ek hi str par utarate hai
 According to Milton, to become a great litterateur one should emulate great and highly honorable things
 milton kaa mat he- Manavis easily get this grand voice
 kabhi-kabhi aisa bhi hota he ki pratibhashali kavi apane jivan ke sandhya kaal main ast hote hue surya kii tarah thanda ho jaataa he or uske parvarti kavy main udaatt kii kami dikhaai dene lagati he
 Homer has the same astral-gamini talent in Odissi
 lonzinus kaa kathan he- ‘‘iliyat homer kii tarunai kii rachana hai, kyonki isamen gati or sangharsh kaa prachurya hai
 In contrast, the majority of the Odyssey are narrative, a product of old age
 ’’ hindi main maithilisharan gupt ke ‘vishnu priya’ or ‘ratnavali’ isi prakaar ke kavy hai, jinamein inaki pratibha kaa apakarsh dekha ja saktaa he
 The later poetry of Pant and Bachchan are also examples of this
 lonzinus ne kalakriti main uddaam aavegon kii anivaaryta par bal diya he, kyonki kriti ke mahaan hone ke liye yah aavashyak he ki pathakon ko bhaavnaatmak uttejnaa pradaan kare
 Emotions or grand impulses are those from which the 'soul' starts to rise on its own and then gets filled with joy
 lonzinus ne aavegon ke do varg banaae hai- ek bhavy or doosraa nimna
 High impulses in grand impulses, ie, exalted emotion, compute probability, respect, amazement, gaiety and valor etc
, while low impulses are associated with compassion, grief and fear
 kavy main udaatt bharne ke liye ucch bhavaveshon kaa grahan tathaa nimna bhavaveshon kaa tyaag hona chahie
 Longinus is of the view that the use of ornaments should be done in such a manner that no one should notice that it is ornamentation
 kala jab kaushalpurvak prayukt kii jaati he to vah apane soundarya or chamatkaar ke vinyas ko kho detii he
 Actually do not marvel at the ornamentation, but it should be for joy
 lonzinus ne athishaymulak alankaaron ko udaatt kaa hetu mana he
 According to him, sublime exists in elaborations like elaborations, oaths, questioning, antonyms, defaults, repetition, articulation, accumulation, essence, transformation, synonyms, exaggeration etc
 atah udaatt ke liye alankaaron kaa sahaj or auchitypurna hona anivaary he
 For example abhijaat abhivyakti se lonzinus kaa taatpary kavy bhashaa he
 He has laid special emphasis on language excellence; Because the expression of sublime is through language
 padaavalee kaa vishayanukool, upyukt prabhaav evam sugumphit hona anivaary he, kyonki urjaswit bhashaa ke prayog dwaara rachanaakaar aisi kriti kaa nirmaan kar saktaa he, jiskaa prabhaav durnivaar ho
 Through appropriate and effective vocabulary, the composition incorporates the qualities of grandeur, dignity, ooze, madave, power etc
 and communicates aliveness
 rachana-vidhaan kaa arth he samanjit shabd-yojana yaa ek nishchit kram se shabdon kii yojana
 According to Longinus, the mutual harmony of various elements makes the work dignified
 jaise sharir ke vibhinn avyavon ke swatantra rahane par koi mahatva nahin he, sabase milane par hi sampoorn sharir kii rachana sambhav hoti he, usee prakaar samast tattvon ke sanyog dwaara hi garimamay kriti kii rachana hoti he
 When all the elements of composition are tied together in a series of harmony, then only they become sublime
 anyathaa vah bikhar jaataa he
 Sometimes the harmony of the composition elements supplies the damage that arises from a particular element of the composition and thus this harmony keeps the sublime effect intact
 atah garimamay evam bhavy rachana-vidhaan bhi udaatt-srijan kaa poshak he
 Longinus has also considered the opposing elements of sublime
 unhone baleyata, asanyat vagvistaar, ast-vyast pad-rachana, hin arth vaale shabd, bhavadambar or shabdaadambar, avaanchit sankshiptata, anaavashyak saaj-sajja, sangeet va lay par atyadhik bal aadi ko udaatt kaa virdohi tatva mana he
 Therefore, the best poet should not place them in his composition
 yah style kaa baari dosha he
 'baleya' literally means 'childish'
 bacchon main jaise chapaltaa, sanyamheenata, halkaapan or kshudrata pai jaati he, vaise hi baleyata kaa dosha us style main mana jayega
 In which to perform the eloquence without restraint, the use of words denoting petty meaning and playful or unstable footsteps
 isamen style kritrim ho jaati he
 According to Longinus- bhav kii garima ke abhaav main alankrita or baari shabdon kaa prayog
 Such as the use of the word 'living samadhi' for a small substance like a deer
 vagadambar udaatt atikaraman ke prayaas se utpann hota he
 Where the author behaves like a drunkard, he often expresses unexpected, meaningless and inconsistent impulses, ie impulse to be expressed even when impulse control is required
 aaveg kii abhivyakti bhavadambar ko janm detii he or udaatt kaa hraas karti he
 The exaggerated statement is rhetoric in the fascination of influencing people
 hindi main bihari ke oohatmak dohe isi dosha se grast hai
 For example, Longinus is of the opinion that the use of the words 'eye-eye' or 'eye-virgin' for 'effigy' and 'effigy' for a woman is a mere rhetoric, not a rhetoric of language 
 parvarti samikshakon main higel ne udaatt ke swaroop ko spasht karne ke liye uski tulana soundarya se kii he
 According to him, beauty means harmony
 soundarya main vastu or kala paksh kaa saamanjasy rahata he
 Sublime situation is different from beautiful
 udaatt vah he jahaan uskaa bhav uske rup kii apeksha adhik prashast or vilsht hota he

 For example, Oxfam, like an NGO that deals with poverty alleviation, provides equipment and skills to the needy people to detect food and clean drinking water, while ngos like FFDA examine and document Assist in cases of human rights violations and provide legal assistance to victims of human rights harassment
 afghanistan soochna prabandhan seva jaise sanghathan anya sanghathanon dwaara kshetra main vikaas gatividhiyon ko karyanvit karne ke liye vishisht takanic utpaada tathaa sevaain pradaan karte hai

 They receive public support and voluntary contributions; They often have strong contacts with community groups in developing countries, and they often work in areas where government support is not possible
 ngos are accepted as part of the international relations landscape, and while they affect national and multilateral policy-making, they are mostly directly involved in local actions

 Although the expertise, which is in these employees and volunteers, can be counterbalanced by a variety of factors, the cost of foreigners is usually high, they do not have basic contacts in the country where they are sent and the local Expertise is often underestimated
 sankhya kii drushti se gaiyr sarkari sanghathan kshetra ek mahatvapurn niyokta he

 Although the R2P doctrine has wide relevance, the Canadian government's use of R2P to justify mediation and support in the coup in Haiti has been more controversial in controversies
 R2P ke varshon baad, vishwa sangheey aandolan, ek sanghathan jo "prajatantric antarrashtriya dhaancha, jo vishwa ke nagarikon ke liye jawaab dey he tathaa alag alag sansthaaon main antarrashtriya adhikaar ke vibhaajan" kii sahaayta karata he, ne bachaav kii jimmedaari - naagarik sansthaaon ko shaamil karnaa, ko prarambh kiya he

 The legal form of ngos is diverse and depends on indigenous variations in the laws and practices of each country

 sabhi dhyani, yogi, gyani nahin ho sakate the, at: 'bhaavana' ke liye pratimaa kii kalpana hui
 Having attained time, the mythological Purthadharma made a great contribution to the tradition of iconography

 Autism is a disorder occurring during brain development that affects a person's social behavior and interaction
 hindi main ise 'aatmavimoh' or 'svaparayanata' bhi kehete hai
 The affected person behaves in a limited and repetitive manner, such as repeating the same task over and over
 yah sab bachche ke teen saal hone se pehle hi shuru ho jaataa he
 a set of these symptoms differentiates narcissism from mild narcotic spectrum disorder, such as Asperger's syndrome
 otism ek maansik rog he jiske lakshan janm se hi yaa baalyavastha se nazar aane lagaten hai
 The development of children who have this disease is unusual compared to other children
 otism hone ke koi ek kaaran nahin khoja ja sakaa he
 According to the recommendations, there can be many reasons for autism such as- aatmavimoh kaa ek majboot anuvanshik aadhaar hota he, haalanki aatmavimoh kii anuvanshiki jatil he or yah spasht nahin he ki ASD kaa kaaran bahujine samvaad he yaa durlabh utparivartan 
 In rare cases, narcissism has also been linked to factors that are responsible for birth defects
 anya prastaavit kaarnon me, bachapan ke tike, vivaadaaspad hai or iske koi vaigyanik saboot bhi nahin he
 According to a recent review, two cases per 1000 people are self-reported, while the number is close to 6 / 1000 for ASD
 ausatan ASD kaa purush:mahila anupaat 4,3:1 he
 Cases of narcissism have increased dramatically since 1980, one of the reasons being the growth in the field of medical diagnosis, but whether these cases have actually increased is an unanswered question
 aatmavimoh mastishk ke kai bhaagon ko prabhavit karata he, par iske kaarnon ko dhang se nahin samajha jaataa
 Parents usually recognize its symptoms in the first two years of their child's life
 shuruaati sangyanatmak yaa vyavhaari hastkshep, bacchon ko swayan kii dekhbhaal, saamaajik or baatcheet kaushal ke vikaas main sahaayta kar sakate hai
 There is no cure for it
 bahut kam aatistic bachche hi vayask hone par aatmanirbhar hone main safal ho pate hai
 Nowadays, a self-imposed culture has developed, in which some people believe in treatment and for some people self-immolation is a condition rather than a disorder
 aatmavimoh ko ek lakshan ke bajaay ek vishisht lakshanon ke samooh dwaara behatar samajha ja saktaa he
 Key symptoms include inability to social interaction, inability to communicate, limited hobbies, and repetitive behavior
 anya pahaluon me, jaise khaane kaa ajeeb tarika haalaanki aam he lekin nidaan ke liye aavashyak nahin he
 Social development In addition to being incapable of self-immolation, humans are unable to understand the intentions of other people, so people often do not take them seriously
 saamaajik asamarthataayen bachapan se shuru ho kar vyask hone tak chalati hai
 Autistic children tend to be indifferent to social activities, do not look at people, do not smile, and most commonly do not react: even when they are called
 otistic shishuon kaa vyavhaar to or chaunkaane vaala hota he, wo aankh nahin milaate hai or apni baat kehane ke liye wo aksar duusare vyakti kaa haath choote or hilaate hai
 Children between three and five years of age usually do not display social understanding, do not respond at all to calls, are insensitive to feelings, silent behaviorists and turn to others
 iske baavjood wo apni praathmik dekhbhaal karne vaale vyakti se jude hote he
 Children with narcissism exhibit less attuned protection than normal children, although this symptom disappears in children with high brain development or who have low ASD
 ASD se grasit bade bachche or vyask chehron or bhaawanaaon ko pahchaanane ke pareekshan main bahut bura pradarshan karte hai
 Contrary to popular belief, autistic children do not like to be alone
 dost bananaa or dosti banaae rakhana aatistic bachche ke liye aksar mushkil sabit hota he
 For them, the quality of friendship matters not the number of friends
 ASD se peedit logon ke gusse or hinsa ke bare main kaaphi kisse hai lekin vaigyanik adhyayan bahut kam hai
 These limited statistics show that only children with narcissism are aggressive or aggressive
 dominic at al, ne 67 ASD se grast bacchon ke mata-pita kaa saakshaatkaar liya or nishkarsh nikaala ki, do tihaai bacchon ke jivan main aanse daur aate hai jab unka vyavhaar bahut bura ho jaataa he jabaki ek tihaai bachche aakraamak ho jate hai, aksar bhashaa ko thik se na jaanane vaale bachche nakhrel hote hai
 There are some major differences between normal children and autistic children in childhood, on the basis of which this condition can be identified as- ek tihaai se lekar aadhe otistik vyaktiyon main apane dainik jivan kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke laayak bhashaa bodh tathaa bolne kii kshamta viksit nahin ho paati
 Shortcomings in communication are visible in the first year of life, including late speaking, unusual gestures, sluggish response, and a lack of cohesion in conversations with your foster
