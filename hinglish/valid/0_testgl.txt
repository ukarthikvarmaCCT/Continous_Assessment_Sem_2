 Neurobiological models in the prefrontal cortex revealed two opposite results of emotion

 "homeostatic bhavanaaen" sharir kii aantarik avasthaa dwaara utpann zajbaat hai, jo hamaare vyavhaar ko vyavasthit karte hai
 Thirst, hunger, feeling hot or cold, feeling deprived of sleep, a desire to eat salt and a desire for air are all examples of homeostatic feelings; Each of these is a signal given by the physiological system that says "everything is not right
 piyo / khao / chaaya main jaao / kuch garam pahano / so jaao / namakeen tukdaa chato / saans lo
" isamen se kisi bhi pranali kaa santulan kharaab hone par, ham homeostatic bhaavana kaa anubhav karne lagate hai or yah bhaavana hamen vahi karaati he, jo us pranali kaa santulan banaae rakhane ke liye aavashyak he

 There are some theories that argue that cognitive action - a judgment, evaluation, or thought - is necessary to produce an emotion
 richard loras ke anusaar yah is tathy ko pramanit karne ke liye aavashyak he ki bhaavana kisi chiz ke bare main yaa jaanboojh kar paidaa hoti he
 This type of cognitive activity can be conscious or subconscious and may or may not take the form of a conceptual process

 Physiological changes - Cognitive responses result in biological changes, such as increased heartbeat or a response to pituitary adrenal
 3
 Action - The person experiences the emotion and chooses to react

 a new hybrid theory of the somatic and cognitive theory of emotions is the perceptual theory
 yah siddhant is tark main alag he kii shaareerik pratikriyaayein, bhaawanaaon par kendrit hai, tathaapi ye bhaawanaaon kii sarthakata par jor detii he yaa is vichaar par, ki bhavanaaen kisi chiz ke bare main he jaisaa ki sangyanatmak siddhanton dwaara paaya gaya he
 The new claim of this theory is that imagined cognition is unnecessary for this type of meaning

 In the Canon Bard theory, Walter Breadford argues in contrast to james-lang's effective theory on the physical facts of emotion in the Canon Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear, and Rage

 yah sunakar herodes raja or uske saath sara jerushlem ghabara gaya
 And he gathered all the high priests and scribes of the people and asked them, where should Christ be born? They said to him, in Bethlehem, Judea; Because that's how it is written by the prophet
 ki he baitalaham, jo yahuda ke desh main he, tu kisi reeti se yahuda ke adhikariyon main sab se chota nahin; kyonki tujh main se ek adhipati nikalegaa, jo meri praja israel kii rakhwali karegaa

 or us ne yah kahkar unhen baitalaham bheja, ki jaakar us balak ke vishay main thik thik maaloom karo or jab vah mil jaae to mujhe samachar do taaki main bhi aakar us ko pranaam karun

 And having received a warning in his dream that he should not go back to Herod, he went to his country by another route
 After they left, see, a messenger of God appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, Get up; Take the child and his mother and flee to the land of Egypt; And stay there until i tell you; Because Herod is looking for this child to have him killed
 vah raat hi ko uthakar balak or us kii mata ko lekar misr ko chal diya
 And remained there until Herod died; Because that word that the Lord had said through the prophet that i had called my son from Egypt to be fulfilled
 jab herodes ne yah dekha, ki jyotishiyon ne mere saath thattha kiya he, tab vah krodh se bhar gaya; or logon ko bhejkar jyotishiyon se thik thik puche hue samay ke anusaar baitalaham or uske aas paas ke sab ladakon ko jo do varsh ke, vaa us se chote the, marava daalaa
 Then the word that was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, that a shrill sound was heard in Ramah, weeping and great lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children and did not want to be calm, because they are not

 dharm or jati ke aadhaar par pruthak nirvaachika dene ke prabal virdohi gandhi ne ashanka jataai, ki achhuton ko di gayi pruthak nirvaachika, hindu samaaj ko vibhajit kar degi
 Gandhi felt that the Savarnas should be given some period of their heart-rending to forget untouchability, but this argument was proved wrong when untouchability continued to be practiced by the upper-caste Hindus even decades after the Poona Pact
 1932 main jab britishon ne ambedkar ke vichaaron ke saath sahmati vyakt karte huye achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene kii ghoshnaa kii

 lekin vahiin dalit varg apni duusari vot kaa istemaal karte hue saamaanya varg ke pratinidhi ko chunane se apni bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the Dalit candidate chosen by the Dalits could have kept the problems of Dalits well, but it was not necessary for the non-candidate to try to solve their problems
 gandhi is samay puna kii yeravada jail main the
 As soon as the announcement of the communal award, Gandhi first wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and demanded that it be changed
 lekin jab unako laga ki unki maang par koi amal nahin kiya ja rahaa he to unhone maran vrath rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Then Ambedkar said that "if Gandhi had kept this fast for the freedom of the country, it would have been good, but he has kept this fast in protest against the Dalit people, which is very regrettable
" jabaki bhartiya isaayiyo, musalamaanon or sikhon ko mili isi adhikaar ko lekar gandhi kii ore se koi aapatti nahin ai
 "he also said that Gandhi is not an immortal person
 bharat main na jane kitne aise logon ne janm liya or chale gaye
 Ambedkar said that he cannot renounce the interests of Dalits to save Gandhi's life

 Gandhi's life was in great distress
 or puraa hindu samaaj ambedkar kaa virdohi ban gaya
 Seeing the increasing pressure in the country, Ambedkar reached Yerwada jail at 5 pm on 24 September 1932
 yahaan gandhi or ambedkar ke bich samjhauta hua, jo baad main puna pact ke naam se janaa gaya
 In this agreement, Ambedkar announced to waive the right to separate electorate received by the Dalits in the Communal Award
 lekin iske saath hin communal award se mili 78 arakshit siton kii bajaay puna pact main arakshit siton kii sankhya badha kar 148 karvaa lee
 Along with this, for the untouchables, adequate amount was allocated in education grant in every province and ensured the recruitment of Dalit people without any discrimination from government jobs and in this way Ambedkar saved the life of Mahatma Gandhi
 ambedkar is samjhaute se asamaadhani the, unhone gandhi ke is anshan ko achhuton ko unke raajnneetik adhikaron se vanchit karne or unhen unki maang se peeche hatane ke liye dawaab daalane ke liye gandhi dwaara khelaa gaya ek naatak qaraar diya

59 meters per second
 dhwani ek yantric tarang he
 It requires a medium for transmission

 The transmission of sound in air is in the form of a longitudinal wave
 alag-alag madhyamon main dhwani kaa veg alag-alag hota he
 The formula for velocity of sound in gases is- jahaan Their values at normal temperature and pressure are as follows: adarsh gas sameekaran kaa prayog karne par, Where p is the pressure of the gas, v is the volume of the gas and m is the mass of the gas
 isse dhwani ke veg kaa nimnlikhit sutara praapt hota he- Where ρ is the density of the medium

 Thirdly, they should also have the ability to bear the air pressure at half time
 inhen kaarnon se kaarkaanon kii deevaaren saadhaaran makaanon kii deevaaron se adhik pusht banaai jaati hai
 The floor of the factories should not be very smooth, so that the workers are not afraid of slipping
 vaise bhi, farsh adhik kadaa or drudh hona chahie, jisase mashiinon kii ghadgadaahat tathaa baari saamaan ke boj se kshati na pahunche
 The amount of concrete in cement is increased, or sodium silicate or ironite is used to increase the floor strength
 kaarkaanon main bheetar kii gandi tathaa geeli hawa badalane ke liye hawa baahar phenkanevaale bijli ke pankhe chat ke paas lagaae jate hai

 In addition to this gate, it is necessary to install another gate on the other side to escape in case of fire
 kaarkaane kii mashiinon kii ghadgadaahat ke kaaran bahut adhik shor or aawaaj hoti he, isliye kaarkaane ko basti se alag nagar ke ek kinare par rakhana chahie
 In many factories, the smoke coming out of the chimney is also filled with toxic gas
 inase bachane ke hetu bhi kaarkaane ko aabaadi se hatakar hi bananaa chahie
 When choosing a location for construction of big factories, it should be considered that water and electricity are available in sufficient quantity and conveniently
 iske atirikt gande pani ityadi kii nikasi bhi samuchi or saste upayon se ho sake
 While fixing the location of the factory, it should also be considered that whether the raw material will be available in suitable quantity and the laborers at reasonable price
 jameen ke chunaav ke samay pani tathaa mitti kii jaanch bhi is vichaar se kerani chahie ki pani shuddh he tathaa bhoomi ke neeche kii parat bahut unchi to nahin he or neenv daalane ke liye mitti yathesht drudh he
 Therefore, while choosing the location in addition to the above mentioned things for the construction of the factory, it should also be kept in mind that in future, sufficient land can also be got easily and cheaply for the expansion of the factory
