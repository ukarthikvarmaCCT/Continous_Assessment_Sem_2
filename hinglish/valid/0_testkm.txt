 Although some scholars theorize that there is no discrimination among the Muslim castes like the Hindu castes, Dr
 Ambedkar gave his argument to the contrary that the social evils in the Muslim society were "worse than the Hindu society"
 babasaheb ambedkar bhartiya raajnneeti ke vikhyath vyakti the or bhartiya samvidhan ke mukhya vaastukar hai
 He was bitterly critical of the Muslim caste system and their practices, citing that "these groups have the same social preference within the caste as the Hindus but in many ways are worse than the Hindu castes
" "

 By acting with sodium or zinc in dry ether of alkyl halide, alkil hellide ko jasta-tanba yaa aluminium-paara yugmak or athenul ke saath apchayan se tathaa By heating alkyl halide in closed tubes with hydriodic acid and red phosphorus
 4
 sawatya-senderence vidhi dwaramono hydrik alcohalon ko hydrodic amla se apchayan or asantrupt hydrocarbonon ke hydrogenikaran se bhi paraphins praapt hote hai
 5
 Paraffin is also obtained by dissolution of magnesium alkyl halide by water-diluted mineral acids, alcohols and alkyl halides
 paraphin yogicon kii shrenee main yogicon ke anubhaar jyon jyon badhate hai tyon tyon yogicon ke vishisht gurutv, galnaank or kvathanank bhi badhate jate hai
 The first four compounds of paraffins are gases, followed by 11 compound liquids and all the remaining compounds are solids
 paraphins pani main nahin ghulte, kintu hydraxil rahit vilaayakon main ghul jate hai
 Chemically, they are inactive

 Paraffin wax is not a fixed compound
 yah paraphin shrenee ke santrupt or asantrupt hydrocarbonon kaa mishran hota he
 Between 21 and 60 carbon atoms have been found in hydrocarbons
 pradhanthya narmal or vivvruth shrinkhalaawaale hydrocarbon rahete hai, par sanvruth shrinkhalaawaale hydrocarbon bilkul apvarjit nahin hai
 Petroleum contains up to three percent wax
 ise paraphin mom kehete hai
 Most of the wax gets into "lubricating oil" when petroleum is distilled
 nirvaat main, athwa bhaap kii upasthiti main, aswan se jo asut praapt hota he usamen mom kii maatra 40 se 50 pratishat tak rah sakati he
 Therefore, such distillate is called wax distillate
 dakshin-purv asia ke tel ke asut main 40 pratishat tak mom paaya gaya he, jabaki europe or america ke kachche tel ke asut main 10 pratishat se adhik mom nahin rahata
 There are two main methods of extracting wax from distillate
 ek reeti main mom asut ko paryaapt thandha karte hai, jisase thos mom drav tel se alag ho jaataa he
 Now filter it in the filter press
 filter press kai prakaar ke tathaa kai patton ke hote hai or vibhinn daab par kaary karte hai
 If the amount of wax in the distillate is small then most of the wax is removed at once, otherwise the process has to be repeated several times
 isse kai shrenee ke mom praapt ho sakate hai
 There is some oil left in such wax cake

 For nine years after leaving university, Kant moved to a village called Judskin, 60 miles from Königsberg
 vahaan vah do teen pariwaron main adhyaapan kaary kar apni jeevika chalaata or bhautikashastra tathaa darshan main swadhyay karata rahaa
 In the meantime, many of his articles and epics were published, two of which are "special Considerations on the Approximation of Living Powers" and "general Natural History and Theory of the Akash"

 He had also submitted the necessary arrangements for the degree of "doctor's Legacy" in 1755 AD and the University of Königsberg certified his qualification by granting him the said degree

 Pleased with his nine years of hard work, the university had appointed him a distinguished lecturer, but he did not get paid for this work

 In those days, such salaries were paid only to respectable teachers

 Even after 1796 AD, he was busy studying, thinking and writing, but these eight years of his life were spent in a very pathetic condition
 uski smriti itani ksheen ho gai thi ki use choti-moti baaten bhi likhakar yaad rakhni padati thim

 This mausoleum is now destroyed and from the remains it is known that it was not located in the center

 Along with this, its mosque is also built

 By the 18th century, the local people started growing vegetables in Charbagas here

 Grateful by this, the Maya demon said to Arjuna, "O Kuntinandan! You have protected my life, so you command me, what should i serve you?" Arjuna replied, "I do not favor any vengeance, but if you have a sense of service in you, then you serve Shri Krishna

 ek din duryodhana ne may daanav ke dwaara nirmit rajsabha ko dekhne kii ichha pradarshit kii jise yudhisthir ne saharsha sweekaar kiya
 Duryodhana was surprised to see the sculpture of that house
 may daanav ne us sabha bhawan kaa nirmaan is prakaar se kiya tha ki vahaan par anek prakaar ke bhram utpann ho jate the jaise ki sthal ke sthaan par jal, jal ke sthaan par sthal, dwaar ke sthaan diwaar tathaa diwaar ke sthaan par dwaar drushtigat hota tha
 Duryodhana also got confused in many places of that building and had to be ridiculed, even while ridiculing him, Draupadi said that 'the blind are blind
 ' duryodhana apane uphaas se pehle se hi jala-bhunaa kintu draupadi ke kahe gayi vachan use chubh gayi
 While returning to Hastinapur, Shakuni said to Duryodhana, "nephew! i am deeply saddened by the insult you have suffered in the house of Indraprastha
" tum yadi apane is apmaan kaa pratishodh lenaa chaahate ho to apane pita dhritarashtra se anumati le kar yudhisthir ko dyut-krida ke liye aamantrit kar lo
 Yudhishthira is a lover of gaming, therefore he will definitely come to your invitation and you know that there is no one in Trilok who can conquer me in the dice game
 paase ke daanv main ham pandavon kaa sab kuch jeet kar unhen punah daridr bana denge
 " hastinapur pahunch kar duryodhana sidhe apane pita dhritarashtra ke paas gaya or unhen apane apamaanon ke vishay main vistaarpurvak bataakar apni tathaa mamaa shakuni kii yojana ke vishay main bhi bataaya or yudhisthir ko dyut-krida ke liye aamantrit karne kii anumati maangi
 After taking a little hesitation Dhritarashtra gave his permission to Duryodhana
 yudhisthir ko unke bhaaiyon tathaa draupadi ke saath hastinapur bulavaa liya gaya
 Taking the opportunity, Duryodhana proposed a game-play with Yudhishthira, which Yudhishthira accepted
 paase kaa khel armbh hua
 Mama Shakuni started throwing dice on behalf of Duryodhana
 yudhisthir jo kuch bhi daanv par lagaate the use haar jate the
 After losing all his kingdom, Yudhishthira also staked his brothers and Shakuni slyly won this bet as well
 yah dekh kar bhishma, dron, vidura aadi ne is jue kaa band karaane kaa prayaas kiya kintu asafal rahe
 Now Yudhishthira staked himself on his own and was again defeated by Shakuni's slyness
 raaj-paat tathaa bhaaiyon sahit swayan ko bhi haar jane par yudhisthir kantiheen hokar uthne lage to shakuni ne kaha, "yudhisthir! abhi bhi tum apana sab kuch waapas jeet sakate ho
 Draupadi is still with you left to stake
 yadi tum draupadi ko daanv main laga kar jeet gayi to main tumhaara haara hua sab kuch tumhen lautaa doongaa
 "disappointed in all ways, Yudhishthira now betrayed Draupadi and lost as usual
 apni is vijay ko dekh kar duryodhana unmatta ho uthaa or vidura se bolaa, "draupadi ab hamaari daasi he, aap use tatkaal yahan le aaiye
 " neech duryodhana ke vachan sun kar vidura tilamila kar bole, "dusht! dharmraj yudhisthir kii patni daasi bane, aisa kabhi sambhav nahin ho saktaa
 It seems that your time is near, that is why such words are coming out of your mouth
 " parantu dusht duryodhana ne vidura kii baton kii ore kuch bhi dhyaan nahin diya or draupadi ko sabha main laane ke liye apane ek sevak ko bheja
 The servant went to Draupadi's palace and said, "maharani! Dharmaraja Yudhishthira lost everything while gambling with the Kauravas
 ve apane bhaaiyon ko bhi aapke sahit haar chuke hai, is kaaran duryodhana ne tatkaal aapako sabha bhawan main bulawaaya he
 Draupadi said, "servant! You go and ask the gurus present in the assembly, what should i do in such a situation? ”the servant returned and put the question of Draupadi in the meeting
 us prashn ko sun kar bhishma, dron aadi vruddh evam gurujan sir jhukaaye maun baithe rahe
 Seeing this, Duryodhana gave orders to Durassasan, "dushasanas! You go and bring Draupadi here
 " duryodhana kii ajna paakar duhshasan draupadi ke paas pahunchaa or bolaa, "draupadi! tumhen hamaare maharaj duryodhana ne jue main jeet liya he
 i have come to call you by their command
 " yah sun kar draupadi ne dhire se kaha, "duhshasan! main rajaswala hoon, sabha main jane yogya nahin hoon kyonki is samay mere sharir par ek hi vastra he
 "dushasan said," whether you are menstruating or clothingless, i have no purpose in this
 tumhen maharaj duryodhana kii ajna kaa paalan karnaa hi hoga
 "listening to his words, Draupadi started running towards Gandhari's palace to recite herself, but Dushyasana swung and grabbed her curly hair and dragged her towards the assembly hall
 sabha bhawan tak pahonchte-pahonchte draupadi ke saare kesh bikhar gayi or uske aadhe sharir se vastra bhi hat gayi
 Seeing this plight of his, Draupadi, filled with anger, said in high tones, "hey wicked! Do the shame of these eminent gurus sitting in the assembly
 ek ablaa nari ke upar yah atyaachaar karte huye tuje tanik bhi lajja nahin aati? dhikkaar he tujh par or tere bharatvansh par!" Even after hearing all this, Duryodhana addressed Draupadi as a maid
 draupadi punah boli, "kya vayovruddh bhishma, dron, dhritarashtra, vidura is atyaachaar ko dekh nahin rahe hai? kahan hai mere balavaan pati? unke samaksh ek gidad mujhe apamaanit kar rahaa he
 "the Pandavas were extremely distressed by the words of Draupadi, but they sat down with their heads bowed down in silence
 draupadi phir boli, "sabhaasadon! main aapse poochna chaahati hoon ki dharmraj ko mujhe daanv par lagane kaa kya adhikaar tha?" draupadi kii baat sun kar vikarn uth kar kehane laga, "devi draupadi kaa kathan satya he
 "yudhishthira had no right to stake Draupadi after her brother and herself were defeated because she is the wife of the five brothers and not Yudhishthira alone
 or phir yudhisthir ne shakuni ke uksaane par draupadi ko daanv par lagaaya tha, swechha se nahin
 Therefore, the Kauravas have no right to call Draupadi a slave
 " Karna, the best friend of Duryodhana, listening to the said words of diagonal, said, "diagonal! You are tomorrow's child
" yahan upasthit bhishma, dron, vidura, dhritarashtra jaise gurujan bhi kuch nahin kah paye, kyonki unhen gyaat he ki draupadi ko hamane daanv main jeeta he
 Are you more knowledgeable than all this? Remember that you do not have the right to say anything to the gurus
 " karn kii baton se utsahit hokar duryodhana ne duhshasan se kaha, "duhshasan! tum draupadi ke vastra utaar kar use nirvasna karo
 "on hearing this, Dushasasan started pulling Draupadi's sari
 draupadi apni puri shakti se apni sari ko khinchne se bachaati hui vahaan par upasthit janon se vinati karne lagi, "aap logon ke samaksh mujhe nirvasan kiya ja rahaa he kintu mujhe is sankat se ubaarane vaala koi nahin he
 Damn to your people's clan and self-confidence
 mere pati jo meri is durdasha ko dekh kar bhi chup hai unhen bhi dhikkaar he
 " draupadi kii durdasha dekh kar vidura se rahaa na gaya, ve bol uthe, "dada bhishma! ek nirih ablaa par is tarah atyaachaar ho rahaa he or aap use dekh kar bhi chup hai
 What happened to your power? At this time, the evil spirit Dhritarashtra is also silent
 vah jaanata nahin ki is ablaa par hone vaala atyaachaar uske kul kaa naash kar degaa
 The entire clan of Ravana was destroyed by the insult of one Sita
 " When Vidur saw that his well-intentioned words were not having any effect on anyone, he went away from there, shouting them all
 duhshasan draupadi ke vastra ko khinchne ke apane prayaas main laga hi hua tha
 When Draupadi saw the councilors present there silently, she said in a tearful manner to Shri Krishna, Dwarka, "O Govind! o Murare! o Krishna! i am no longer in this world except you, except for my shame
 ab tumhiin is krishna kii laaj rakho
 " bhaktavatsal shri krishna ne draupadi kii pukaar sun lee
 He left all the work and immediately appeared there invisibly and settled in the sky and started increasing Draupadi's sari
 duhshasan draupadi kii sari ko khinchate jaataa tha or sari thi ki samaapt hone kaa naam hi nahin leti thi
 While dragging the sari, the mishap became disgusting but could not succeed in its work
 ant main lajjit hokar us chupchaap baith janaa padaa
 Now, after seeing the tall pile like that mountain of sari, all the people sitting there started praising Draupadi's pativrat from the free gorge and started denying the misery
 draupadi ke is apmaan ko dekh kar bhimsen kaa sara sharir krodh se jala ja rahaa tha
 He declared, "if the wicked whose hands have dragged Draupadi's hair, if i do not destroy those hands with my mace, then i shall not get salvation
" yadi main uski chaati ko cheer kar uskaa raktpan na kar sakun to main koti janmon tak narak kii vednaa bhugatta rahon
 i am under the control of my brother Dharmaraj Yudhishthira, otherwise i will destroy all the Kauravas like a mosquito and destroy them
 yadi aaj mai swami hota to draupadi ko sparsh karne vaale ko tatkaal yamalok pahunchaa detaa
 " bhimsen ke vachanon ko sun kar bhi anya pandavon tathaa sabhaasadon ko maun dekh kar duryodhana or adhik utsahit hokar bolaa, "draupadi! main tumhen apni maharani bana rahaa hoon
 Come, you sit on my left thigh
 in punsatvaheen pandavon kaa saath chhod do
 "on hearing this, Bhima stood up to fight with his Duryodhana, but Arjuna held him and stopped him
 is par bhim punah duryodhana se bole, "duratma! main bhari sabha main shapath le kar kahata hoon ki yuddh main teri jaangh ko cheer kar na rakh don to meraa naam bhim nahin
 " isi samay sabha main bhayankar apshakun hota dikhaai padaa
 The whole atmosphere was filled with the cry of jackal-dogs
 is utpaat ko dekhakar dhritarashtra or adhik maun na rah sake or bole uthe, "duryodhana! tu durbuddhi ho gaya he
 After all, Draupadi is my son's bride
 use tu bhari sabha main nirvasna kar rahaa he
 "after this he said to Draupadi," Daughter! You are truly a lover
 tum is samay mujhase jo var chaaho maang sakati ho
 "draupadi said," If you are happy then give me this boon that my husband can get freedom from slavery
 " dhritarashtra ne kaha, "devi! main tumhen yah var de rahaa hoon
 The Pandavas are now slavery free
 putree! tum kuch or maanganaa chaaho to vah bhi maang lo
 Draupadi said, "O Tat!" You return the divine chariots and weapons of my husbands
 " dhritarashtra ne kaha, "tathastu"
 The divine chariots and weapons of the Pandavas were returned

 kamaal ataturk urf mustafaa kamaal pasha ko aadhunik turki kaa nirmaataa kaha jaataa he
 The historical work that he did by turning the dice of the imperialist ruler of Turkey, Sultan Abdul Hameed II, to create a wonderful social, political and economic system, proved his name worthwhile
 kamaal pasha kaa janm 19 may san 1881 main salonika ke ek kisaan parivaar main hua tha
 His mother's name was Juvaida and father's Ali Raza
 ali raja salonika ke chungi daftar main clerk the
 His childhood name was Mustafa
 janm ke kuch varsh baad hi pita kii mrityu ho gayi
 Mata Zubaida entered the madrasa for the purpose of getting a religious education, where she got down on killing her after harassing her senior students
 maatr 11 saal kii umr main hi vah itane durdant ho gayi the ki unhen maktab se nikaalnaa padaa
 He was later admitted to the Sainik School in Monastir
 parantu vahaan bhi unka mar mitane vaala ugravadi swabhaav bana rahaa lekin sainya-shiksha main dilchaspee ke kaaran unki padhai badastoor jari rahi, usamen koi vyavdhaan nahin aayaa
 The child Mustafa was fierce but his speed in mathematics was surprising
 adhyaaapak ke blike board par sawaal likhte hi vah use munhajbani hal kar diya karata tha
 Seeing the amazing ability in it, the school's mathematics teacher Captain Mustafa Ufendi changed his name to Kamal
 uske baad hi vah kamaal pasha ke naam se janaa jane laga
 After receiving his initial military education at the primary military school in Monastir at the age of 17, he was sent to the Staff College of Kustuntunia for higher military education
 un dinon kustuntuniya main abdul hamid kii sultanate thi or uske rajiadhipati ko sultan kaha jaataa tha
 There he roamed in bad company along with studies
 kuch kaal tak uddandtapurna jivan bitaane ke baad vah vatan naamak ek gupt krantikari dal ke pehle sadsy bane or thode hi dinon baad uske netaa ho gayi
 The purpose of Vatan was to eradicate the dictatorship of the Sultan on the one hand and foreign intrigues on the other
 ek din dal kii baithak chal rahi thi ki kisi guptchar ne sultan ko khabar de di or sabake sab shadyantrakari afasar giraftaar karke jail bhej diye gayi
 According to the prevailing law, all of them could be given the death penalty, but the ill-fated Sultan feared that rebellion would not erupt in the country, so he decided to grant pardon to all
 is prakaar anya sanikon ke saath kamaal bhi kshamaadaan main chhod diye gayi
 Subsequently, the Sultan sent him to Damascus to suppress the rebellion of the Druze caste
 vahaan kamaal ne kaam to kamaal kaa hi kiya, par swabhaav ke anusaar kustantuniya waapas lautate hi unhone stambul main ek cameraa lekar vatan-o-hurriyat party kaa karyaalay kholkar usamen aazaadee kii gupt sanstha kaa kaary armbh kar diya
 Meanwhile, he came to know that there was going to be an open rebellion against the Sultan in Macedonia
 maukey kii najaakat ko bhaanpate hue kamaal ne sultan kii sena se chuttee le lee or jaafaa, miru va athens hote hue vesh badalakar vidroh ke kendra salonika ja pahunche
 But they were recognized there
 phir vah greece hote hue jaafaa kii ore bhaage
 But by then the order of his arrest had reached there too
 ahamed be naamak ek afasar par kamaal ko pakadaney kaa bhaar tha, par chunki ahamed swayan vatan kaa sadsy tha, isliye usne kamaal ko giraftaar karne ke bajaay gaja morche par bhej diya or yah sultan ko yah report bhej di ki vah chuttee par gayi hi nahin the
 Although Kamal was able to stay in Salonika for a very short time, he understood well that it would be better to make Salonika the center of rebellion, so after a lot of efforts, in 1908 he got Salonika transferred
 yahan anwar ke netritv main do saal pehle hi ekta or pragati samiti ke naam se ek krantikari dal kii sthapana ho chuki thi
 Kamal immediately became its member, but she was not made up of the leaders of the party
 phir bhi ve samiti kaa kaam nirantar karte rahe
 One leader of this party, Niazi, revolted against the Turkish government with only a few hundred men
 yadhyapi thi to yah badi morrkhtaa kii baat, parantu chunki sara desh taiyaar tha, isliye jo sena usase ladane ke liye bheji gayi thi, vah bhi anwar se ja mili
 Thus Anwar cheered in the country
 ab sah sammilit sena rajdhani par akraman karne kii taiyaari kar rahi thi
 The Sultan also made some governance reforms in those days
 phir bhi vidroh kii shaktiyaan apana kaam karti raheen, par jab vidroh safal ho chukaa tab sultan abdul hamid ne sena ke kuch logon ko yathesht ghoose dekar apane saath mila liya, jisase sainikon ne vidroh karke apane afasaron ko maar daalaa or phir ek baar islam, sultan or khaliph kii jai ke naare buland hue
 Anwar was in Berlin these days
 vah jaldi hi laute or unhone abdul hamid ko gaddi se utaar kar anek pratikriyaavaadi netaaon kii phaansi par chadha diya
 In this way administrative power came into the hands of Anwar's revolutionary committee
 aam janata ko digbhramit karne ke liye sultan ke bhanje ko singhaasana par bitha diya gaya
 Here Kamaal Pasha continued to plot against Anwar because in his view Anwar was undoubtedly idealistic but more impractical
 baavjood is sabake anwar ne us samay hone vaale videshi akramanon ko ek ke baad ek lagaataar vifal kiya isse janata main anwar kii khyaati or adhik badi
 Anwar then embarked on the task of making his all-islamic dream come true and the first thing he did for it was to hand over the responsibility of organizing the Turkish army to a German general
 kamaal ne iske viruddh yah kehete hue aandolan prarambh kiya ki yah to turki jati kaa apmaan he
 On this, Kamal was sent to Sofia by making a military ambassador
 isi bich mahayuddh chhid gaya
 Anwar could not succeed in this, but Kamal thwarted the British trick of conquering Kustantunia in a battle, and then his victory continued to prevail
 phir bhi mahayuddh main turki haar gaya
 Working hard day and night, he kept agitating against foreigners
 1920 main sevra kii sandhi kii ghoshnaa hui parantu isaki sharten itani kharaab thim ki kamaal ne fouran hi ek sena taiyaar kar kustuntuniya par akraman kii taiyaari kii
 Meanwhile, Greece attacked Turkey and launched an army at Smyrna which started moving towards the great center of Angara
 ab to kamaal ke liye badi samasya paidaa ho gai, kyonki is yuddh main yadi ve haar jate to aage koi sambhaavna na rahati
 So they fought the war with great preparation, as a result of which the Greek army gradually had to retreat
 is bich france or rus ne bhi kamaal ko gupt rup se sahaayta dena shuru kiya
 In a few days the Greeks were driven out
