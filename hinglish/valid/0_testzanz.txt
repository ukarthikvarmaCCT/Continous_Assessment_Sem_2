 In historical context, the characters of the poem may have been Norse paganism, although the poem was recorded by Christian anglo-saxon who converted widely to anglo-saxon paganism in the 7th century - both anglo-saxon paganism and Norse paganism are cited from European paganism

 In the poem depicting the warrior society, the most important aspect of human relationships existed between the warrior - thean - and his master, a relationship that was based on mutual trust and respect rather than one man's submission to the will of another man
 
 jab ek yoddha apane swami ke prati vafadari kii kasam khaataa he, to vah uske naukar kii bajaay ek svaichhik saathi ban jaataa he, jise apane swami kaa bachaav karne or yuddh main uske ke liye ladane main garv mahasoos hota he
 In return, Swami was expected to take care of his thanqui and award him for his valor

 Unforth was also part of the infantry team, which, throughout the story, does nothing and "usually has a black stain among the heroic saga
" " At the same time, Richard North argues that the Beowulf poet has interpreted Danish myths in a Christian form

 Grendel's mother and Grendel are described as descendants of Cain, a fact that some scholars associate with the Cain tradition
 alan cabanis kaa tark he ki biovulf or bible ke bich kai samanthaayen hai
 He first argued for similarities between Beowulf and Jesus: both are brave and selfless in overcoming their rival demons, and both were kings who sacrificed their lives to save their people
 Second, he argues for portions of The Book of Revelation and the similarities between Grendel and Grendel's mother's house
 teesraa, unhone gaspal of luk main yishu ke shabdon kii tulana kavita ke us bhaag jab biovulf apane dushman anfarth ko maaf kar detaa he, se kii he
 Scholars, however, disagree with the meaning and tendency of the poem: was it a Christian work done in a European pagan context? The question suggests that the work done by Christians by the conversion of European pagan beliefs was a very slow and continuous process lasting many centuries, and the propensity for the message of the poem in the context of religious belief at the time the poem was written remains highly ambiguous

 Were they the prayers of paganists who have continued to use the later appropriated Christian phrases? Or, does the author of the poem portray Beowulf as a Christian hero, symbolically igniting Christian virtues? is par bhi dhyaan diya janaa chahie ki je

 maanav sansaadhan ke sandarbh main kisi karmchaaree ko kisi duusare karmchaaree ke dwaara pratisthapit karne ko shramavart yaa shram-pratisthaapan kehete hai
 An employee may be separated from an organization for several reasons - expulsion, retirement, death, transfer, resignation, etc
 kisi sanghathan kaa shramavart dar ek nishchit samay main us sanghathan ko chhodane vaale karmchaariyon kii sankhya, karmchaariyon kii kul sankhya ke pratishat ke rup main vyakt kii jaati he, arthath There are many reasons for the rise in labor
 mrityu or avkaash prapti iske do prakritik kaarak hai jiske kaaran shramik kaa uske kaary se algaav hota he
 Also, these places are filled soon so that the production process is not interrupted
 shramikon dwaara kaary se aichhik vaapasi doosraa mahatvapurn kaarak he jo ki shramavart ko badhaata he
 It is expressed in two forms, first as resignation and second as work abandonment
 pratham rup main, shramik kaary se tyaag patr dene kii ichha vyakt karata he or kaary ko chhodane ke iraade ko vyakt karne ke liye prabandhak ko vidhiwat soochna detaa he jabaki duusare rup main vah kaary ko bina bataaye hi chhod detaa he
 Several reasons may be responsible for resignation
 udaahranarth - adhik acchhee naukari mil janaa, santhaan kii sharto kaa manjuur na hona, santhaan ke antargat apamaanit kiya janaa, santhaan kaa anupyukt hona, paariwarik maamalon main ulajh janaa ityadi
 The third important factor is removal
 nishkasana ke liye bhi anek kaarak uttaradaayi ho sakate hai
 For example, demonstrating indiscipline, non-performance of work from a qualitative and quantitative point of view, rebellion against the institute, absence without leave for work, etc
 shramavart ke parinaamon ko ham teen bhaagon main vibhajit kar sakate hai
 We can divide the results of labor in three parts
 pratyaksh parinaam : ve parinaam he jinke antargat naye bhartee kiye gayi shramikon k prashikshan hetu vyay kiye gayi kharch ko sammilit kiya jaataa he, saath hi bhartee kiye jaan main hone vaale chote mote kharche bhi aate hai
 Additional expenditure incurred in relocation: The additional expenditure under this is due to lack of skill of newly recruited workers which affects both qualitative and quantitative forms of production
 naye shramikon ko bhartee karne se purv hone vaale atirikt vyay : yah haani isli hoti he kyonki puraane shramikon ke sthaan par naye shramikon ko bhartee karne main bhi samyaantar ho jaataa he
 Over that period, production falls, causing damage to the institution
 shramavart kii ucch dar audyogic sambandhon evam karmchaariyon main sthirataa or bhakthi bhaavana tathaa vishwasaneeyata utpann karne main sahaayak nahin ho sakati
 The ill effects of labor can only be prevented if the data related to it are collected reliably and in their analysis find factors that have been responsible for high rates of labor in changing circumstances
 audyogic drushti se pragatisheel pashchimi deshon main bahirgaman saakshaatkaar shramavart kii daron ko ghataane ke liye ek kargar yantra ke rup main saamne aayaa he
 Under this, a team is appointed by the Department of Personnel, which is constantly working to determine whether the workers' separation from the institution is voluntary or involuntary
 jab bhi koi tyaag patr praapt hota he, tyaag patr dene vaale shramik kaa saakshaatkaar kiya jaataa he or use is baat kii purna swatantraaa di jaati he ki vah bina kisi bhay or sankoch ke apni bhaawanaaon ko vyakt kar sake
 If the worker leaves the work without notice, it is a continuous effort to establish a relationship with him where it can be found and to try to bring to light the facts that led to the labor leaving the work

 yadi maamla chantni yaa barkhaastagi kaa he to is baat kii purna pariksha kii jaati he ki jo bhi kaarywahi kii gai he vah shram vidhaanon evam sthaayee adhyadeshon ke pravidhanon k antargat kii gai he yaa nahin
 Such exit interviews provide managers with special understanding and knowledge about the circumstances and reasons under which workers leave the institution
 is prakaar prabandhak is baat kaa nirnay lene main apane ko sakasham paata he ki uske santhaan main shramavart kii unchi dar kaa kaaran kharaab kaary kii paristhitiyon, yaa anya jagahon par uttam kaary kii prapti, prabandh kii shram niti yaa vyavhaar, shramik kii khud kii galtiyaan yaa duracharan, shramik sangh ke netaaon kaa vyavhaar yaa kaary kii neerasata he; in karkon main se koun se kaarak shramavart kii ucch dar ke liye kitna jimmedaar he, or inako samaapt karne ke liye koun sa nirodhatmak upaay apanaaye ja sakate hai
 To test such exit interviews, managers must be given opportunities within their respective institutions to find out the factors of high labor rates and find preventive measures to eliminate them
 is prakriya ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye malika or shramikon kii sanyukt samitiyon kaa gathan prayek santhaan main kiya janaa chahie
 These committees should have representatives of owners and workers
 saath hi in sabkon is disha main sanyukt prayaas karne chahie
 Generally, all the measures which are related to resignation and expulsion should be adopted to reduce the labor force
 tyaag patron ko kam karne ke liye santhaan ke antargat kaary kii sharto evam dashaon main sudhaar karte hue ve sabhi kaary karne honge jisase ki shramik kaary santosh kii bhaavana kaa anubhav kar saken or kisi bhi str par uske aatm sammaan ko thes na pahunche
 The pay scale that a worker can get outside the institute must be paid that much under the institute
 nishkasana ko kam karne ke liye shramikon main kaary tathaa santhaan ke prati bhakthi bhaavana ko badhaate hue ashasanheenata ko kam karnaa hoga
 For this, managers, inspectors and colleagues should be treated sympathetically with workers
 shramikon ko prabandh main bhaag lene kaa avasar pradaan kiya jaay, saath hi unke dwaara anubhav kii gayi kathinaaiyon ko bhi dur kiya jaay, shramik sanghon kii bahulatata ko kam kiya jaay or shramikon main prajatantric mulyon ko viksit kiya jaay taaki unke apane varg main parsparik sammaan kii vruddhi ho sake
 Measures such as cooperatives should be used
 nipunatapurna bhartee, kaary evam shramik vishleshan aadi adhik kargar siddh ho sakate hai

 In fact, a gas turbine is an internal engine
 isamen ek sabase pehle ek ghurni sampidak hota he, uske baad jvalan kaksh hota he or ant main ek tarabine
 The principle of working a gas turbine is similar to the principle of working a steam power plant
 antar bas itnaa he ki yahan bhaap ke sthaan par hawa kaa upyog hota he
 Air enters the compressor from the atmosphere, where it compresses
 sampidit vaayu ko dahanakaksh main laayaa jaataa he, jisamen eendhan kii sahaayta se vaayu garam kii jaati he
 Hot air comes out of the combustion chamber into the turbine and works through this device
 kaary karne ke baad vaayu baahar nikal jaati he
 Three thermodynamic processes are performed on the gases passing through the ideal gas turbine, these are in teenon ko milakar bresan chakra kehalaata he
 Two combustion systems are used: in do pranaaliyon main sthir daab chakra acha paaya gaya he
 The thermodynamic cycles treated in a gas turbine are: pratham prakaar ke chakra main vayumandal se taaji vaayu sampidak main pravesh karti evam tarabine main kaary karne ke baad vayumandal main hi nishkasit ho jaati he, kintu duusare prakaar ke chakra main baahar se taaji vaayu nahin aati he, varan usee vaayu yaa gas kaa barambar parivahan hota he
 To increase the efficiency of the turbine, various types of equipment are put into practice, the main ones being: sampidak se nikalakar sampidit vaayu isamen ek ore se pravesh karti he evam duusari ore se tarabine dwaara nishkasit gas pravesh karti he
 The gas is hotter than compressed air
 isiliye taap gas se sampeedit vaayu main pravesh karata he tathaa sampidit vaayu or bhi garam ho jaati he
 Overheating of compressed air requires less fuel in the combustion chamber
 isse sampurna sanyantr kii dakshata bad jaati he
 Any reduction in compression work increases the available power, which increases the efficiency of the plant

 These are the following: gas tarabine main do prakaar ke sampidak lagaae jate hai, akshapravaah evam apakedrik
 The behavior of the axis current compressor was very low earlier, but with the development of aerodynamics in the last few years, the design of such compressor has been simplified and its efficiency has also increased
 audyogic gas tarabine main is prakaar ke sampidak kaa adhik vyavhaar hota he, kyonki iske dwaara ucch daab anupaat evam ucch dakshata kii prapti hoti he

 The design of this organ is very delicate and complex
 iske dwaara kaary praapt hota he
 The compressor is driven with the help of a turbine, so that some of the work received in the turbine is spent running the compressor
 isiliye, uplabdh shakti = tarabine dwaara praapt kaary - sampidak main kharch kiya hua kaary The thermal efficiency of a gas turbine depends on the entrainment of the gases working in the turbine
 yah taap jitna adhik hoga dakshata utani hi adhik hogi, kintu gas ke taap ko badhaane ke pehle tarabine ke falkon ke liye vyavahrut saamagree main bhi us taap par kaary karne kii kshamta hoti chahie
 Intensive research has been done in this field and many new materials have been developed
 ye samagriyan ucch taap evam ucch pratibal kii visham avasthaaon main bhi sucharu rup se kaary kar paati hai
 With the development of new new construction materials, another way to increase the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is to cool the hot parts

 Hollow panels have been made and are cooled by compressing air
 is tarah se falkon ke saath hi saath paribhramak bhi thanda hota rahata he
 Gas turbines often contain all types of fuels
 patale tel ko jalaane main koi kathinaayee nahin hoti
 Special type of toiletries are required for burning thick oil, because while burning this type of oil one has to do the following problems- gas tarabine mulchaalak he
 It is a rotary type device, so friction loss is much less than that of backward conductors
 gas tarabine kii yantric dakshata 95 se 97 pratishat tak hoti he, jab kii antardahan ingine kii dakshata 80 se 85 pratishat tak hi ho paati he
 The gas turbine has a good balance, which reduces vibration

 Except electricity generation, it is treated as the basic driver of locomotives, rail engines, motor vehicles, ships, aircraft, etc
 gas tarabine kii ushmiya dakshata ab bhi kam hi hoti he
 Although a number of accessories have been removed to change the direction of movement of the gas turbine device, it is not easily replaceable
 gas tarabine swat:pravarti mulchaalak nahin he
 Apart from this, there is a problem that the efficiency of the gas turbine decreases as the power demand decreases

 Iltumish, not believing these rebel chieftains, formed a group or organization of 40 of his slave chiefs, named as 'turkan-i-chihalgani'
 is sanghathan ko ‘chargaan’ bhi kaha jaataa he
 Pirthu rebellion occurred in Awadh during Iltutmish's time
 1215 se 1217 i

 After this, his son 'hisamuddin Iwaz' succeeded
 usne 'gayasuddin aajim' kii oopaadhi grahan kii tathaa apane naam ke sikke chalaae or khutaba padhwaaya
 In 1225 Iltutmish launched a campaign against the independent ruler 'hisamuddin Iwaz' in Bengal
 ivaaj ne bina yuddh ke hi uski adheenta main shashan karnaa sweekaar kar liya, par iltutamish ke punah dilli lautate hi usne phir se vidroh kar diya
 This time Iltutmish's son Nasiruddin Mahmud almost defeated him in 1226 AD and took control of Lakhnauti
 do varsh ke uparant nasiruddin mahmud kii mrityu ke baad malik ikhtiyaruddin balka khalji ne bengal kii gaddi par adhikaar kar liya
 Iltutmish suppressed this rebellion in 1230 AD

 The Khalifa confirmed Iltutmish in all the territories he had won
 saath hi caliph ne use 'sultan-e-ajam' kii oopaadhi bhi pradaan kii
 After receipt of the certificate, Iltutmish became a legitimate Sultan and the Delhi Sultanate became a legitimate independent state
 is sweekruti se iltutamish ko sultan ke pad ko vanshanugat banane or dilli ke singhaasana par apni santaanon ke adhikaar ko surakshit karne main sahaayta mili
 Iltutmish assumed the title of 'nasir Amir ul Mominin' after getting the title
 iltutamish pehla turk sultan tha, jisane shuddh arabi sikke chalavaaye
 He introduced two important coins 'silver ka taka' and 'jeetal' of 'copper' during the Sultanate period
 iltutamish ne sikkon par taksaal ke naam ankit karwaane kii parampara ko armbh kiya
 On the coins, Iltutmish mentions himself as the representative of the Caliph
 gwalior vijay ke baad iltutamish ne apane sikkon par kuch gauravpurn shabdon ko ankit karavaaya, jaise “shaktishaalee sultan”, “samrajya va dharm kaa surya”, “dharmanishthon ke nayak ke sahaayak”
 Iltutmish introduced the 'iqta system' and shifted the capital from Lahore to Delhi
 bayana par akraman karne ke liye jate samay maarg main iltutamish biimaar ho gaya
 After this, Iltutmish's disease increased
 antatah april 1236 main uski mrityu ho gai
 Iltutmish was the first Sultan who understood and improved the economic importance of the Doab
 razia sultan iltutamish kii putree tathaa bharat kii pehali muslim shasika thi
 In his last days, Iltutmish was concerned about the question of his succession
 iltutamish ke sabase bade putr nasiruddin mahmud kii, jo apane pita ke pratinidhi ke rup main bengal par shashan kar rahaa tha, 1229 i
 ko april main mrityu ho gai
 The remaining surviving sons of the Sultan were not eligible for any form of governance
 at: iltutamish ne apni mrityu shaiyya par se apni putree razia ko apana uttaradhikari niyukt kiya
 Under architecture, Iltutmish completed the construction work of Qutubuddin Aibak
 bharat main sambhavtah pehla mazebara nirmit karwaane kaa shrey bhi iltutamish ko diya jaataa he
 Iltutmish built the Jama Masjid of Badaun and Atarkin's door in Nagaur
 ‘ajmer kii masjid’ kaa nirmaan iltutamish ne hi karavaaya tha
 He established a school in Delhi
 iltutamish kaa mazebara dilli main sthit he, jo ek kakshiya mazebara he
 Until the war of Crimea, there was a war around the Black Sea, in which France, Britain, Sardinia, Turkey fought on one side and Russia on the other
 'kreemia kii ladaai' ko itihaas ke sarvaadhik moorkhtapurna tathaa anirnaayak yudhon main se ek mana jaataa he
 The reason for the war was a feeling of Slavist nationality
 iske atirikt duusare taraf turki ke dharmik atyaachaar bhi kaaran bane, kintu behad khun kharabe ke baad bhi nateeja kuch bhi nahin niklaa
 This war may have been fought without cause, yet its special significance is considered in European history
 un dinon europea deshon main logon kii yah dharna ho gai thi ki rus ke paas itane adhik shastrastra hai ki vah ajey he
 People were terrorized by that
 kustantuniya kii ore rajyavistaar karne kii rus kii niti peter mahan ke samay se hi chali aa rahi thi
 He used to look for some excuse for aspiring for this expansion of his kingdom
 is yuddh ko pehla aisa yuddh mana jaataa he jisamen janata ko pratidin kii ladaai kii khabar mili
 William Russell and Roger Fenton of The Times newspaper described the fight in the letter
 is yuddh kaa sutarapaat ek chote se dharmik vivaad ko lekar hua
 In those days, Palestine was under the Turkish Empire
 1535 i
 main turki ke sultan ne roman isaayiyon ke tirthasthanon kii dekhbhaal france ke sangrakshan main french catholic padariyon ko saunpa tha
 Similarly the religious places of the greek-christian sect located in Turkey were given under the patronage of the Tsar of Russia
 kintu france kii prakhyat rajkranti ke samay france apane uttardaayitv kii ore samuchit dhyaan na de sakaa
 Gradually, the saints of the greek-christian sect became dominant over Latin religions
 1850 i
 main francenaresh napolian tritiy kaa dhyaan latin carch kii ore gaya; usne unke prabandh ko france ke sangrakshan main de dene ke liye turki ko likhaa
 In 1852 AD, he repeated this demand
 kuch hila-hawali karne ke baad turki ke sultan ne france kii is maang ko sweekaar kar liya
 There was no reason for Russia to object to this Turkish work; But he saw it as a good opportunity to seize Turkey
 unani-isai sampradaay kaa paksh lekar jaar ne sultan ko latin dharmik sthalon kaa prabandh unhen lautaa dene ko likhaa
 This made England apprehensive
 use dar laga ki kustutuniya par rus kaa adhikaar ho jane par sthal maarg se bharat ke liye sthaayee khatra utpann ho jayega or yah aisa khatra hoga jiskaa kisi prakaar bhi saamana karnaa uske liye sambhav na hoga
 He stood up to help Turkey against Russia
 france ke liye to rusht hone kaa spasht kaaran tha hi
 Russia is interfering with the right to care for its shrines
 kintu isse bada kaaran yah tha ki jaar nicholas pratham ne france ke nae samrat ko ‘bhai’ sambodhit na kar ‘mitra’ sambodhit kiya tha
 Therefore, seeing the favor of the greek-christian sect of Russia, he saw a threat to his dynasty
 austria ko bhi balcon kii ore roosi badhaav se ghabrahat hui
 Although in 1849, Austria received his ancestral throne with Russian military aid, it did not seem appropriate to accept Russia's gratitude and remain silent on this occasion
 uskaa jhukaav france or england kii ore hone laga
 He turned down Russia's challenge at the behest of the British ambassador
 iskaa jo parinaam hona tha hua
 In July 1853, the Russian army marched and took possession of the provinces of Moldova and Balesia, the territory of Turkey north of the Danube River
 tatkaal england or france kaa sanyukt nausenic bedaa turki kii sahaayta ke liye bosphorus pahunchaa; kintu angareji or francisi yupoton ke dekhte dekhte sinope ke nikat roosi nausena ne turki ke bede ko nasht kar diya
 Then, in early January 1854, a joint fleet of England and France entered Kalasagar and the two countries soon declared war against Russia
 unhone apni rakshaatmak yuddh karne kii yojana banaai
 To protect Kustuntunia, he decided to build fortifications at Gallipoli
 kintu iske purv ki angl-french senaayen kalasagar ke pashchimi tat par varna main ekatra hon, austria ke amaitreepurn rukh ko dekhakar rus ne apni sena ko turki ke adhikrut pradeshon se waapas bula liya
 Thus ended the possibility of an invasion of Turkey by Russia
 falat: england or france kii sthiti visham ho gai
 Violent cholera spread in Varna
 sena vahaan chodi nahin ja sakati thi
 On the other hand, the return of his army to India without fighting was a sign of inferiority of the rulers of both the countries
 at: kuch karne kii dhun main unhone kreemia par akraman karne kaa nishchay kiya
 Russia had a naval base at Sevastopol on its southern coast
 use adhikaar main karnaa unhone apana lakshya banaaya
 The two countries took a harsh decision, but neither of them had any knowledge about the territory of Crimea
 utsaahi france ne jab is kathinaayee kaa anubhav kiya tab usne planchet par napolian mahaan kii aatma ko bulaakar usase salaah lene kii baat kii
 The maps Raffet prepared for Sevastopol and Balaklava were studied; Ranview-expert Gemini was consulted but no encouraging news came out
 asafalataa kii hi sambhaavnaayen jaan padi
 Here the British Cabinet did not see any need for serious thinking
 usne kreemia ke nakshe par saamaanya dhang se drushtipaat kiya or kaha ki topon ke bal par sthaldam degree ke avaruddh kar kreemia ke prayadweep ko mukhya bhubhag se kaat dena koi kathin kaam nahin he
 Till then he did not know that there is no more than two-three feet of water in the sea on either side of the degree of land
 unhone yuddh ke liye aadesh jari kar die
 The armies reached Eupotoria on 14 September
 17 sitambar ko unhone sevastopol kii or badhanaa aarambh kar diya
 On 20 September, he defeated the Russian army, but with no conclusive results
 roosi senapati tadelben ne sevastopol ke durg main ghuskar durg kii raksha kii puri taiyaari kar lee
 The anglo-french army laid siege to the fort
 aage koi karrwai ve kar paaen, iske purv jaada aa gaya; samuchit khanepine, vasradi kii vyavastha ke abhaav main sainik dayaneey sthiti main pad gaye
 The situation of the English army became worse
 jo jahaaj unke lise saamaan laa rahe the ve balklawa ke bandargah main bhayankar samudri tufaan main padakar nasht ho gaye
 By the end of the year, 8,000 soldiers fell ill
 aspataalon kii sthiti beemaari ko ghataane ke bajaay badhaanevaali thi
 Less than half of the men survived
 jab florence nite angel mahila swayansevikaon ko lekar pahaunchi or bimaaron kii sevasushrusha kii vyavastha kii tab kahin sthiti main kuch sudhaar hua
 When winter subsided, another problem arose
 taar ke avishkaar se twarit sampark sthapit karne kii suvidha ho gai
 Therefore, the orders which reached the headquarters of both the countries in ten days, now started arriving in 24 hours
 is suvidha kaa upyog england or france ne alag alag dhang se kiya
 For England, military failure meant nothing more than a rearrangement in the cabinet
 at: yuddh vibhaag ne uskaa upyog keval apane captain jevis ke swasthya ke prati chintaa vyakt karne main kiya
 But for the Emperor of France, defeat was a message of the destruction of the dynasty
 at: ve apane senapati ko danaadan suzav, salaah or aadesh bhejne lage
 As a result, the generals of both the countries were unable to get up from the table and think of anything else due to this kind of exchange of wires
 phir bhi april aate aate un logon ne sevastopol ke ghere kii gati teevr karne kii cheshtaa kii
 In June, the English army attacked Redan and the French army attacked Melekaf but the Russians thwarted both attacks
 kintu jab aangl-french sena ne kinberne par adhikaar kar liya tab rus ne yuddh jari rakhana vyarth samajha
 By this time, the French king Napoleon was also afraid of this war
 vah aage yuddh karne ke paksh main na tha
 But the British, who had failed in the attack of Sevastopol, were upset
 ve yuddh jari rakhana chaahate the kintu akele rus se yuddh kar sakna unke bas kii baat na thi
 The diagnosis occurred in Paris
 is sandhi main anya baton ke atirikt mukhya baat yah thi ki danube nadi main sabhi deshon ke jahaajon ke liye yatayaat khol diya gaya; kalasagar tatasth kshetra ghoshit kiya gaya; prayek desh ke yupoton kaa vahaan aana nishiddh kar diya gaya
 In other words, Russia had to withdraw its warship from Kalasagar; But within fifteen years these things of the treaty became meaningless
 vienna congress ke pashchaat kreemia yuddh europe itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana tha
 As a result of this war, on one side, Russia's Turkish plan failed, on the other hand, Turkey got new life
 italy or germany ke ekikaran rus kii raajnneeti balkan prayadweep ke purna nirmaan evam antarrashtriya raajnneeti par is yuddh kaa gaharaa prabhaav padaa
 There were many reasons for this war
 jo is prakaar he
 Russian policy 19 veen shatabdi main turki samrajya kaa patan hota ja rahaa tha
 Taking advantage of this, various European nations wanted to divide it among themselves
 rus iske liye vishesh prayatnsheel tha
 He began to take a keen interest in Turkey's case
 rus chahta tha
 That Turkey be weakened so that it could expand its empire in the Balkan region
 at: usne balcon prayadweep ke praja ko turki ke khilaaf andolan ke liye bhadakaayaa
 Russia's objective was to end Turkey
 or turki samrajya ke khandhar par k vishaal rusi samrajya kaa mahal khadaa karnaa chahta tha
 Therefore, whenever he got the chance, Russia proposed to split Turkey against the European
 britain kaa swaarth- England was a strong opponent of Russia's ambition
 kyonki bhumadhya sagar main rus kaa pravesh englad ke liye sankat utpann kar saktaa tha
 At the same time, the Indian Empire of England could also be in danger due to Russia's authority over Turkey
 isliye bhartiya samrajya kii suraksha ke liye turki ko rus ke adhikaar main jane se bachaane ke liye uski ahm bhoomika thi
 England never wanted it to expand eastward
 halanki rus ne england ko apni ore milaane kii cheshtaa kii lekin use safalataa nahin mil saki
 Even after various attempts, when England could not be in favor of Russia, he started planning to annex Turkey by the sword
 france kaa swaarth- France was also eyeing Europe's ailing nation Turkey
 lui nepolian yuddh niti ke dwaara france kaa vistaar karnaa chahta tha
 He began to interfere in Turkey's case
 kreemia yuddh kaa shutrapat nepolian ke isi niti ke falswarup hua
 Mohammal Ali's Rebellion and European Nations Intervention in Turkey- mohammad ali mishra kaa governor tha
 Who was the suzerain of the Turkish Empire
 parantu mohammad ali ek swatantra shaasha tha
 Despite Turkey's aid in Greece's freedom struggle, it did not benefit her
 at: vah syria ke viruddh sainik kaarywahi kii
 The Turkish Sultan was terrified at this
 usne rus se sahaayatka praapt kii
 This led to disharmony among the various nations and the leading European countries began to pressurize Turkey to withdraw the Russian army to make a pact with Mohammad Ali
 samjhauta ke falswarup mohammad ali ko syria de diya gaya
 Here, Russia wanted some prize from Turkey in return for his help
 1832 main usne turki ke saath ek sandhi kii jiske dwaara turki par rus kaa prabhaav kaayam ho gaya
 England was alarmed by the incident and called a conference of European states in London
 sabhi rashtron ne ek sandhi patr par hastakshar kiya
 As a result, Russia's influence on Turkey decreased somewhat
 iske pashchaat lagbhag das varshon tak shanti kaayam rahi parantu france main lui nepolian kaa jamaana aayaa to usne rus ke isaai kaa padriyon kaa paksh lekar purvi samasya ko ubhaarna shuru kiya cremia yuddh isaki kaa parinaam tha
 Religious reasons isaai kaa pavitra jerusalem turki samrajya ke adheen tha
 Saints of the Roman and Greek churches lived there
 unke saath turki sultan kaa vyavhaar acha nahin tha at: 1742 ke sandhi ke anusaar roman sanyasi kii raksha kaa bhaar rus par kar diya gaya
 But chaos erupted in France as a result of the French Revolution
 to unani padri ne roman carch par akraman karnaa shuru kiya
 Louis Napoleon began to dedicate the Roman clergy, and Russia began to side with the Greek clergy
 at: purvi samasya bigadane lagi
 Diplomacy tension prevailed in Europe over this problem for three years
 rus europe main kutniti tanaav vyapt rahaa
 Russia wanted to invade Turkey by making religious pretext and seizing its territories
 1853 main rus ne turki par akraman kiya tathaa noladavia or belaysia par adhipaty kar liya
 On Russia, England and France assure Turkey of assistance; Turkey assures Turkey
 On 27 February 1854, England and France jointly warned Russia that Russia should vacate the territory of Turkey
 lekin santosh janak uttar na milane ke kaaran donon ne rus ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di
 This war was the war of Crimea
 jisamen ek ore england, france or turki tathaa dusri rus oly bilkul akelaa tha yah yuddh do varshon tak chalata rahaa
 There was immense loss of money
 rus kii jabardast paraajay hui
 The war ended by the Treaty of Paris in March 1856
 is prakaar yuddh man mistra rashtron kii vijay or rus kii paraajay hui
 On 30 March 1856, the Paris Treaty was signed by representatives from England, France, Austria, Turkey, Servia and Russia
 jiske anusaar kalasagar kii tatasth kshetra ghoshit kiya gaya
 All the rivers were internationalized
 mol divia or bolegia par rus kaa sangrakshan samaapt kar diya gaya
 Servia's independence was guaranteed
 turki ko europe ke raashtra samuh main shaamil kar liya gaya
 And accepted its integrity and independence
 kreemia yuddh europea itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana maani jaati he
 Two types of conceptions have been expressed about this war
 rabart merriott ne ise aadhunik yug kaa purn vyarth yuddh bataaya tha, unhone likhaa he
 "the only perfectly useless modern war that has been waged
" Lord Cromer says the opposite
 ‘yadi kreemia yuddh nahin hota to turki par rus kaa adhipaty kaayam ho jaataa’ da
 em
 kedelvi ne likhaa he
 As a result of the Crimea War, Russia's Turkish plans were halted
 rus kii jabardast paraajay hui
 Turkey got new life under the protection of Europe Napoleon's attack froze
 england kaa rashtriya rin bad gaya or austria ne ek mahaan desh kii shatru mol lee
 Robert Morritt's view seems to be in part excusable
 kreemia yuddh ke pashchaat turki kaa patan avashyabhanvi ho gaya
 Servia was granted independence
 yah anya paradheen deshon ke liye prerana strot sabit hua
 And foreigners became restless for their freedom
 kreemia yuddh kaa pramukh uddeshy rus ko kamjor bananaa tha
 But even this objective could not be successful
 yah sochna ki rus aage chajalkar shant ho jayega galat sabit hua
 As soon as he got the chance, he plunged into the former problem again
 The purpose of the Treaty of Paris was to curb Russian ambitions and to keep Turkey alive, but this could not be an angel either
 at: yah kaha ja saktaa he
 That the war was fought for the purposes for which it was fought
 us drushti se yah vyarth sabit hua
 England or France did not benefit anyone
 parantu itnaa hote hue bhi kreemia yuddh ko purna vyarth yuddh nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In fact its indirect result proved to be far-reaching and important
 ketolavi likhaa he
 "it is indirect results were greater out of the mud of Cremica new Italy way made and less of obviously a new Germany" Indeed, this war had such a definite effect on the events of the 19th century that the importance built in Vienna in 1815
 His foundation was shaken
 turki par prabhaav- As a result of this war, Turkey got new life
 vah europe ke raashtra samuh main shaamil ho gaya
 His integrity and independence were accepted
 rus kaa bhay samaapt ho gaya
 Effect on Russia is yuddh ne rus kii sainik shakti ko aghat pahunchaaya or jaar shahi kii kamajori ko ujagar kar diya
 He had to suffer even more damage, the idea of the historian Hojan
 ‘is rashtriya apmaan main bhavishya kii aashaaen nihit thi
 Just as the army was completely formed after the defeat of the army, so was the reconstruction of Russia, it is an important event of the historian of Russia
 kyonki is paraajay ke baad hi yahan vyapak sudhaar hua parantu kreemia yuddh kaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn parinaam yah hua ki iskaa kustuntuniya par adhikaar karne or kaala sagar ko rusi jhil banane kaa sapana bhang ho gaya
 Impact on England is yuddh main england kaa uddeshy pura ho gaya
 The expansion of Russia was banned but it caused huge loss of money to England and its national tax was given, which made it difficult to implement reform schemes
 france par prabhaav- The pride of France increased considerably in the wake of the war
 yuddh main rus kii paraajay hui
 Napoleon avenged France's defeat with Russia
 italy par prabhaav- This war also had an impact on Italy and Germany
 If this war had not taken place, Italy and Germany would not have been unified, in fact, Italy was greatly benefited by this war
 austria par prabhaav- England and France were unhappy with Austria's adoption of a policy of neutrality
 rus bhi naaraaz ho gaya
 Austria became friendless and no one was left with her
 46 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year of the year 46 BCE or the year before his birth is represented as the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 46 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kali Yuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc
 pakshivigyaan jeevigyaan kii ek shakha he
 This includes topics related to description of birds' external and infrastructure, their classification, expansion and development, their daily routine and direct or indirect economic utility to humans, etc
 pakshiyon kii dincharya ke antargat unke aahaar-vihaar, pravrajan, yaa ek kshetra se duusare kshetra main sthanantaran, anuranjan, need nirmaan, maithun, prajnan, santan kaa laalan paalan ityadi kaa varnan aata he
 Modern photography has helped a lot in the study of birds' routines
 pakshiyon kii boli ke phonograph record bhi ab taiyaar kar liye gaye hai
 The beginning of ornithology is very ancient
 arestu ke lekhon me pakshi sambandhi anek sahi vaigyanik avlokanon kaa ullekh paaya jaataa he
 But the recognition of ornithology as a branch of science is relatively modern
 gharelu chidiyon kii aakarshak sundarataa, aarthik upyogita or chidiyon ke shikaar dwaara manushya kaa manorajan ityadi anke kaarnon se, anya praaniyon kii apeksha, pakshi varg bhalee bhanti vikhyath he or vyavsaayik tathaa shaukia donon hi prakaar ke vaigyanikon ke liye aakarshan kaa vishay rahaa he
 Many scientific discoveries have been made and new knowledge has been received about birds, which have been included in many new booklets related to birds
 yadhyapi ye pustikas purnat: vaigyanik nahin hai, phir bhi inase anek vaigyanik vrittant uplabdh hote hai
 This is the reason that even in those sections of the earth, which are more rugged forests and which have not been thoroughly investigated, very few new species of birds have been detected, because even in those places, most of the birds have been known very long ago
 More search and information has been done
 kintu yahi ke rup main praapt honevaale pakshiyon ke vishay main nahin kyonki pakshiyon ke jeevashm ke vishay main sam samay ascharyajanak khojein hui hai or abhi bahut adhik khoj kii jaati he
 Charles Darwin's theory of evolution has created a great revolution in ornithology and other branches of biology
 jin dinon pranivigyaan ke anya virgon ke visheshgy nai jati ke varnan main vyast rahe, pakshivigyanvetta pakshiyon kii jati ke sookshm antaron kaa pataa lagane main or is baat kii khoj main lage the ki prakruti main nai jati ke jeevon kaa abhyuday kaise hota he
 It is being emphasized nowadays by the study of birds that the new race of beings originates from their geographical isolation and this is the reason why geographical location has been included in the third section of scientific nomenclature of all creatures
 jeevon ke vaigyanik namakaran se, jisase kisi bhi desh or bhashaa ke vaigyanik praaniyon tathaa pakshiyon kii jati ko pahchaan saken, jeevigyaan main bahut badi pragati hui he
 The method of scientific nomenclature of organisms is adopted from the tenth edition of the treatise "sistema nachuri" by the resident Carolus Linnaeus
 is paddati ke anusaar kisi praani ke naam ke do yaa teen khand hote hai
 The first section of the name refers to his lineage, the second section to his caste and the third section to his subcaste, which is based on geographical area or other characteristics
 udaahranarth saadhaaran bhartiya gharelu coy kaa vaigyanik naam saamaanya bhasmachhavi kaak or dakshin bhartiya coy kaa naam dakshin krishna kaak or bhartiya junglee coy kaa naam saamaanya krishna kaak he
 Ornithologists adopted this method of naming from 1910 AD, but the researchers of other animals have started adopting it now
 bhartiya pakshiyon ke vishay main anek vyaktiyon ne achche kaam kiye hai or pustaken likhi hai
 Birds are very important in Indian culture

 In the Rigveda mantra, the metaphor of two supranas sitting on a tree explains the difference between soul and soul
 arthved ke mantra main navadanpati ko chakva danpati ke samaan nishthavan rahane kaa aashirwad diya gaya he
 The Yajurveda Samhita - 'taittiriya' is named after the Tittir bird
 pahari maina tathaa shukon ko unki vaak kshamta ke aadhaar par unhen vaagdevi saraswati ko samarpit kiya gaya he
 Here the Rig Veda mentions 20 birds, the Yajurveda has 60 birds
 yah dhyaan dene yogya he kyonki rugveda kaa rachanakaal lagbhag 4,000 varsh i

 There are microscopic observations on many birds in the Ramayana and Mahabharata, then in the Puranas
 sara samskruti sahitya, praakrit tathaa pali sahitya bhi, pakshiyon ke gyaan se samrudh he
 It is even more commendable that hunting of some special birds has been prohibited in Manusmriti, Parasharsmriti etc
 for the conservation of birds
 kautilya ke arthshaastra main bhi aise hi pakshi-sangrakshan ke samachit nirdesh hai
 All these are the events of the period when in addition to domesticated animals and birds were seen mainly as hunting and food
 charakasamhita kaa sankalan kaal saatvin shatee isha purv he 
 Charaka Samhita, Sangeet Ratna and Bharatamuni's Natyashastra have a subtle description of the characteristics of birds, which are based on scientific method
 kintu iske baad ke uplabdh sahitya se aisa lagata he ki, baad main, sambhavatya barbaron se apni raksha main jujhate bharat main, pakshiyon kaa adhyayan vaigyanik drushti se na kiya ja sakaa
 Yes, in Sanskrit literature, birds are described on the basis of microscopic observation, with very tenderness and affectionate feelings
 mithunarat kronch ke vadh ko dekhakar adikavi valmiki kaa hriyad karun ras se otprot hokar kavita ke rup main bah niklaa tha, ‘‘maa nishad pratishthanam tvam xxrep 4 
 ’’ arthath he nishad tumhen samaaj main pratishtha nahin milegi xxrep 5 
 Yes, Babur, Humayun and Jahangir, who were very Sikar lovers in the Mughal period, made a subtle observation of birds and wrote
 lok sahitya main bhi pakshiyon kaa vishesh sthaan he, kintu hindi sahitya main pakshiyon ke vaigyanik adhyayan tathaa sookshm avlokan kii parampamara kinhi kaarnon se aage nahin badi
 And whatever description of birds, it is mostly on the tied tradition whether the birds are chattak, chakor, papiha, stork, chakravak etc
 or parrot, myna, goose, owl, crow, vulture, ababil, khanjan etc
 kintu iske saath yah dukhad sach he ki aaj saamaanya vidhyaarthee yaa vyakti ko pakshiyon tathaa ped-paudhon kii sahi pahchaan batalaane vaala ruchikar sahitya, hindi main, nahin ke baraabar he
 a variety of methods and tools are used in biology

 The Kashmir dispute has been going on since 1947 between India and Pakistan over the authority over Kashmir
 isko lekar pakistan ne bharat par teen baar hamalaa kiya or tino baar use buree tarah se paraajay mili! 1971 ke yuddh main to bharat ne palatwaar karte hue pakistani sena ko islamabad tak khaded diya tha! or lagbhag aadhe pakistan par kabja kar liya parantu pakistan ke aatmasamarpan ke baad bharat ne udaartaa dikhaate huai jiti hui jameen punah lautaa di! In October 1947, Maharaja Harisingh, the then ruler of Jammu and Kashmir, signed a merger letter for the merger of his princely state with India
 governor general mountbeton ne 27 oktober ko ise manjuuri di
 The blueprint of the merger letter was exactly what the hundreds of other princely states who had joined India used to include their princely states in India
 na isamen koi shart shumaar thi or na hi riyasat ke liye vishesh darje jaisi koi maang
 As soon as this legal document was signed, the entire Jammu and Kashmir, including the illegally occupied area of pakistan, became an integral part of India
 ab ham baat karte hai ki kis tarah aadhe kashmir par kabja kiya gaya
 Here we will talk about Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh
 bharat ke is uttari rajya ke 3 kshetra hai- jammu, kashmir or ladakh
 Unfortunately, Indian politicians declared the region a state without understanding the geographical location of the region, as all three regions were under the same king
 sawaal yah uthta he ki aazaadee ke baad se hi jammu or ladakh bharat ke saath khush hai, lekin kashmir khush kyon nahin?haalanki visheshgy kehete hai ki pakistan kii chaal main philhal 2 fisadi kashmiri hi aae hai baaki sabhi bharat se prem karte hai
 Mehbooba Mufti has said this in one of her interviews
 landan ke researchron dwaara pichley saal rajya ke 6 jilon main karaae gaye survey ke anusaar ek vyakti ne bhi pakistan ke saath khadaa hone kii vakaalat nahin kii, jabaki kashmir main kattarpanthi algaavvaadi samay samay par isaki vakaalat karte rahete hai jab tak kii unako vahaan se aarthik madad milti rahati he
 From there the order comes closed and stoned and that order is served
 aatankwaad, algaavvaad, fasaad or dange- ye 4 shabd hai jinke madhyam se pakistan ne duniya ke kai mulkon ko pareshaan kar rakhaa he
 Especially, India is the most important target for him
 kyon? is ‘kyon’ ke kai jawab hai
 India has no clear policy
 bhartiya rajaneta nirnay lene se bhi darate hai yaa unamem shuturamurg pravriti viksit ho gai he
 Now they can not even think about the battle of r or Par because they keep fighting and making rhetoric all day
 seemaa par sainik mar rahe hai purvottar main jawan shahid ho rahe hai isaki bhartiya rajanetaaon ko koi chintaa nahin
 They also have to do politics on this
 kehete jarur hai ki deshhit ke liye sabhi ekajute hai lekin lagata nahin he
 These are notable: the matter is of Kashmir, then the people of Kashmir on both sides, whether they are Muslims or non-muslims, are leading lives and painful lives
 maje kar rahe hai to algaavvaadi, aatankwaadi or unke aakaa
 Their children roam around the country and abroad and live in all kinds of luxury
 bhartiya kashmir ke halaat to pakistani kashmir se kai guna zyada achche hai
 Many Muslim families from Pakistan occupied Kashmir have come and taken refuge in India
 pakistan ne donon hi taraf ke kashmir ko barbaad karke rakh diya he
 Neither the land nor the Kashmiri Muslims will benefit the land locked Azad country with an area equal to the 10th part of Bhutan
 pakistan or china kaa isse jarur bhala ho jayega or antat: yah hoga ki iske kuch hisse pakistan kha jayega or kuch ko china nigal legaa
 China has swallowed some part
 yah baat kattarpanthi kashmiriyon ko samaj main nahin aati or ve samajhnaa bhi nahin chaahate
 This is history: in 1947, partitioned India became independent
 us daur main bhartiya riyasaton ke vilay kaa kaary chal rahaa tha, jabaki pakistan main kabailiyon ko ekajute kiya ja rahaa tha
 Here the princely states of Junagadh, Kashmir, Hyderabad and Travancore were delaying the merger, while some independent states wanted
 iske chalate in rajyon main asthirataa faili thi
 The problem of merging Kashmir was more complex than the problem of Junagadh and Hyderabad
 kashmir main musalmaan bahusankhyak the lekin panditon kii taadaad bhi kam nahin thi
 The problem was complicated due to the border of Kashmir with Pakistan, so Jinnah immediately started working on a plan to occupy Kashmir
 haalanki bharat or pakistan kaa bantwaaraa ho chukaa tha jisamen kshetron kaa nirdhaaran bhi ho chukaa tha phir bhi jinna ne paristhiti kaa laabh uthaate hue 22 oktober 1947 ko kabaili luteron ke bhesh main pakistani sena ko kashmir main bhej diya
 Rivers of blood were washed away in present-day occupied Kashmir
 is khooni khel ko dekhakar kashmir ke shaasha raja harisingh bhaybheet hokar jammu laut aae
 There he demanded military assistance from India, but it was too late to reach aid
 nehru kii jinna se dosti thi
 They could not think that Jinnah would do something like this
 lekin jinna ne aise kar diya
 At the time of partition of India, the issue of Kashmir remained unresolved due to wavering policy and short-sightedness of the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru
 yadi puraa kashmir pakistan main hota yaa puraa kashmir bharat main hota to shaayad paristhitiyaan kuch or hotin
 But this could not happen, because Kashmir was ruled by King Harisingh and after a long time he decided that Kashmir should be merged with India
 der se kiye gaye is nirnay ke chalate pakistan ne gilgit or baltistan main kabyli bhejkar lagbhag aadhe kashmir par kabja kar liya
 The Indian Army was advancing rapidly, rescuing the Pakistani Army's sixes, reclaiming the Kashmiri territory they had occupied, that on 31st December 1947, Nehruji appealed to the UNO to call on the north-west robbers of Pakistan
 Prevented from invading India
 falswaroop 1 janvari 1949 ko bharat-pakistan ke madhya yuddh-viraam kii ghoshnaa karai gai
 Earlier in 1948, Pakistan disguised its army into Indian Kashmir in the form of tribesmen and tried to capture the entire valley, which failed
 nehruji ke yuano main chale jane ke kaaran yudhviram ho gaya or bhartiya sena ke haath bandha gaye jisase pakistan dwaara kabja kiye gaye shesh kshetra ko bhartiya sena praapt karne main phir kabhi safal na ho saki
 Today, half of the area in Kashmir is the Line of Control and in some areas the international border
 antarrashtriya seemaa se lagaataar firing or ghuspaith hoti rahati he
 After this, Pakistan tried to occupy Kashmir in 1965 with its military force, due to which it had to face mouth
 is yuddh main pakistan kii haar hui
 Stung by the defeat, Pakistan acted to spread hatred towards India and the entire politics of Pakistan became based on Kashmir, that is, if you want power, then talk about seizing Kashmir
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki 1971 main usne phir se kashmir ko kabjane kaa prayaas kiya
 Then the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi fought it out and eventually 1 lakh soldiers of Pakistan Army surrendered to the Army of India and an independent country called 'bangladesh' was born
 indira gandhi ne yahaan ek badi bhul kii
 If she wanted to, the problem of Kashmir would have been solved here forever, but she came under the influence of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and 1 lakh soldiers were released
 is yuddh ke baad pakistan ko samaj main aa gai ki kashmir hathiyaane ke liye aamane-saamne kii ladaai main bharat ko haraa paanaa mushkil hi hoga
 After a humiliating defeat in 1971, soldiers were sworn in to revenge the defeat at the Pakistan Military Academy in Kabul, and preparations for the next war began to be carried out but the situation in Afghanistan began to deteriorate
 1971 se 1988 tak pakistan kii sena or kattarpanthi afghanistan main uljhe rahe
 Here the Pakistan army strengthened itself in guerrilla warfare and learned new methods as options for war
 yahi tareeke ab bharat par aajamaae jane lage
 He first showed Sikhs' dream of 'khalistan' in Pakistani Punjab and helped to set up an organization of armed Sikhs to launch terrorism in Indian Punjab
 pakistan ke is khel main bharat sarkaar ulajhati gai
 The politics of India changed after the assassination of Mrs
 Indira Gandhi on 31 October 1984 as an unfortunate Operation Blue Star in Golden Temple and its revenge action
 ek shaktishaalee netaa kii jagah ek anubhav or vichaarheen netaa rajeev gandhi ne jab desh kii bagdor sanbhali to unke aalochak kehane lage the ki unke paas koi yojana nahin or koi niti bhi nahin he
 Many people rejected what he said during the 1984 riots
 unhone kashmir kii taraf se puri tarah se dhyaan hataakar punjab or srilanka main laga diya
 The road to India changed after Indira Gandhi
 punjab main aatankwaad ke is nae khel ke chalate pakistan kii najar ek baar phir muslim bahul bhartiya kashmir kii ore tik gai
 He started preparing people for terror in Pak occupied Kashmir
 afghanistan kaa anubhav yahaan kaam aane laga tha
 The then President General zia-ul-haq planned a 'war with low intensity' against India in 1988 under the name 'operation Topak'
 is yojana ke tahat bhartiya kashmir ke logon ke man main algaavvaad or bharat ke prati nafrat ke beej bone the or phir unheen ke haathon main hathiyaar thamane the
 After many mouths, Pakistan began to think of a new kind of war against its more powerful enemy in the 90s and eventually called it 'war of Low Intensity'
 darasal, yah gorilla yuddh kaa hi viksit rup he
 Indian politicians knew everything but still they were silent, because they were worried about more votes than India, worried about alliances, worrying about staying in power
 bhartiya rajanetaaon ke is dhulmul ravaiye ke chalate kashmir main ‘oparation topaak’ bagaiyr kisi pareshaani ke chalata rahaa or bhartiya rajaneta shuturamurg banakar satta kaa sukh lete rahe
 Except for Kashmir and the Northeast, Indian politicians kept paying attention everywhere
 ‘oparation topaak’ pehle se duusare or duusare se tisare charan main pahunch gaya
 Now his intention was not only to keep Kashmir disturbed, he started being active in Jammu and Ladakh too
 pakistani sena or iesai ne milakar kashmir main dange karaae or uske baad aatankwaad kaa silsilaa chal padaa
 Increasing the number of mosques in the first phase, evacuating non-muslims and Shias from Kashmir in the second phase and preparing the public for rebellion in the third phase
 ab iskaa chauthaa or antim charan chal rahaa he
 Now Pakistani flags are waved publicly and openly against India, because there are no non-muslim nor Shias in the Kashmir Valley
 kashmir main aatankwaad ke chalate kareeb 7 lakh se adhik kashmiri pandit visthapit ho gaye or ve jammu sahit desh ke anya hisson main jaakar rahane lage
 During this time thousands of Kashmiri Pandits were killed
 haalanki abhi bhi kashmir ghati main lagbhag 3 hajaar kashmiri pandit rahete hai lekin ab ve ghar se kam hi baahar nikal pate hai
 According to former UK Foreign Minister Jack Straw, problems like the Kashmir dispute and the arab-israel conflict are a product of Britain's colonial past

 Sartaj Aziz, the Prime Minister's advisor on Pakistan's foreign affairs and national security, raised the Kashmir dispute as the main issue between the two countries
 pradhan mantri nawaz sharif ne paak adhikrut kashmir kii vidhansabha main ek satr ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha ki jab tak kashmiri janata kii mahatvakankshaon ke anusaar is vivaad kaa hal nahin kiya jaataa, yah kshetra ‘avishvaas or tanaav’ kii giraft main bana rahegaa
 The indo-pakistan War of 1947–1948, sometimes known as the First Kashmir War, was fought between India and Pakistan between the princely state of Kashmir and Jammu from 1947 to 1948
 yah chaar bharat-pakistan yudhon main se pehla tha do nae swatantra raashtra kashmir ko surakshit karne ke prayaas main pakistan ne wajiristaan se adivasee lashkar kaa shubharambh karke aazaadee ke kuch hafton baad pakistan yuddh shuru kar diya tha, jisaki bhavishya main shesh raashi main lataka hua tha
 The inconclusive outcome of the war still affects the geopolitics of both countries

 british cmanderon ke adhikariyon ne shuru main pakistan ke sainikon ko bharat main pravesh ke hawaale se sangharsh main pravesh se inkaar kar diya

 a formal ceasefire was declared at 23:59 on the night of 31 December 1948

 However, most neutral assessments believe that India was the winner of the war as it was able to successfully defend nearly two-thirds of Kashmir, including the Kashmir Valley, Jammu and Ladakh

 jiner diod ek prakaar kaa diod he jo ek saadhaaran diod kii tarah bijli ko aage kii disha main bahane kii hi nahin balki yadi voltage, brakedown voltage se, jise "jiner ni voltage" yaa "jener voltage" bhi kaha jaataa he, zyada hua to ulti disha main bhi bahane kii anumatideta he
 The device is named after Clarence Jenner, who discovered this electrical property
 ek paaramparik thos-avasthaa vaala diod paryaapt bijli kii anumati nahin degaa yadi vah reverse brakedown voltage se neeche reverse-biked he
 When the reverse-biased breakdown voltage increases, a conventional diode is subjected to high power due to avalanche breakdown
 yadi yah vidyut pravaah bahya paripathakaar dwaara simit nahin kiya jaataa, to yah diod sthaayee rup se kshatigrast ho jaataa he
 In the case of a large forward bias, the diode exhibits a drop in voltage due to its junction gap voltage and internal resistance
 voltage kii giravat kii raashi, ardhchaalak padaarth or doping sandratha par nirbhar karti he
 a Zener diode exhibits almost the same properties, except that the device is designed for reduced dissolved voltages, the so-called Zener voltages
 a Zener diode contains a large number of doped pn junctions that allow electrons to tunnel from the combination band of the p-class material to the conduction band of the n-class material
 parmaanu paimaane main, yah tanneling, sangyojan band electron ke khaali chaalan band sthiti main antaran se mail rakhata he; isaki vajah he, in bandon ke bich ghatit baadha or ucch bijli kshetra jo donon taraf ke apekshaakrit ucch str kii doping se prerit hota he
 a reverse-biased Zener diode exhibits a controlled breakdown and allows electricity to keep the voltage across the Zener diode at a Zener voltage
 For example, if a reverse-biased voltage higher than the Zener voltage is used, a The diode whose Zener drop voltage is 3
2V will exhibit a 3
2 v voltage drop
 haalanki, bijli aseemit nahin he, isliye jiner diod ko aamtaur par ek pravardhak charan ke liye ek sandarbh voltage utpann karne yaa kam-bijli anuprayogon ke liye ek voltage stabliser ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 The damping voltage can be controlled quite accurately by the doping process
 jabaki kshamta 0
05% ke bheetar uplabdh he, sabase adhik vyapak rup se istemaal kii jane vaali kshamta 5% or 10% he
 Another mechanism, which produces similar effects, is the avalanche effect, as in avalanche diodes, in fact both types of diodes are created in the same way and both effects are present in such diodes
 5
6 volt tak ke silicon diod main jiner prabhaav ek praadhanya prabhaav he or ek chihnit pratikul taapmaana gunank dikhaata he
 Above 5

6 v diod taapmaana sambandhit mahatvapurn anuprayogon main pasandida ghatak he
 Modern manufacturing techniques have produced devices with a voltage coefficient of negligible temperature below 5
6 V, but the temperature coefficient increases impressively when high voltage devices are encountered
 ek 75V ke diod main 12V ke diod ke gunank se 10 guna zyada he
 All such diodes are commonly marketed under the name of Zener diodes, regardless of their breakdown voltage
 jiner diod kaa vyapak rup se prayog ek circuit main voltage ko niyantrit rakhane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 To reverse-bias the Zener diode when the voltage reaches the reverse breakdown voltage of the diode when it is connected in parallel with the source of a variable voltage
 us bindu se vah voltage ko usee mulya par rakhata he
 The resistor r in this shown circuit provides a voltage drop between UIN and UOUT

 These devices are also encountered, typically in the transistor stage with the base-emitter junction as a series, where selective devices centered at the depolarization / zener point operate the temperature coefficient equilibrium compensation at the PN junction of the transistor

 vastav main bible ishwariya muktividhan ke karyanvayan kaa itihaas he jo old testament main prarambh hokar isa ke dwaara new testament main sampadit hua he
 So, there is a close relationship between the two parts of the Bible
 old testament kii ghatnaon dwaara isa ke jivan kii ghatnaon kii prishthbhumi taiyaar kii gai he
 The New Testament shows how liberation is accomplished by Jesus' personality, miracles, education, death and resurrection; How did Jesus establish the church and how has this church looked at the events of Jesus' life in its early development to see what conclusions have been drawn from them
 bible main prasangvash loukik gyaan vigyaan sambandhi baaten bhi aa gai hai; unpar taatkaalik dharanaon kii puri chhap he kyonki bible unke vishay main shaayad hi koi nirdesh dena chaahati he
 Presenting a divine interpretation of the history of mankind and understanding religion and liberation is the prime objective of the Bible, there can be no confusion in the teaching of the Bible
 usamen anek sthalon par manushyon ke papacharan kaa bhi varnan miltaa he
 Such conduct has not been presented as an exemplary model, but it becomes clear by that how human beings are and how much they need the salvation of God

 The Bible is a compilation of 66 texts in total - there are 39 texts in the Old Testament and 27 texts in the New Testament
 pavitra biblaudio bible pariyojna The first five texts of the New Testament are historical, namely the works of the four disciples of the four Gospels and Acts of the Apostles
 antim granth apokalips kehalaata he
 In this, the gospel writer Saint Yohan portrays in the symbolic style the picture of the future of the church and the end of liberation
 navvidhan ke shesh 21 granth shiksha pradhan hai, arthath sant paal ke 14 patr, santapeter ke do patr, susamachar lekhak sant yohan ke teen patr, sant yaqub or sant juud kaa ek ek patr
 Sant Pal's letters are either written to the residents of a particular place or to a particular person
 ibraniyon ke naam jo patr bible main sammilit hai, inaki pramanikta ke vishay main andeh nahin he kintu sant paal ke vichaaron se prabhavit hote hue bhi inkaa lekhak koi doosraa hi hoga
 Out of the above list of biblical texts, some of the Old Testament texts were not included in the Hebrew Bible, namely Tobias, Yudith, Macabi, Pragya Sirah, and parts of Daniel and Esther

 The Bible is also inspired by God and is also the creation of ordinary human beings; Therefore, it is necessary to take care of this double motherhood in its interpretation
 manushya kii kriti hone ke kaaran anya loukik sahitya kii tarah bible kaa adhyayan kiya janaa chahie; at: From this it becomes clear that in addition to the detailed information of the countries mentioned in the Bible, many ancillary disciplines such as linguistics, history, geography, archeology, comparative study of religions are very important for the biblical lecturer

 This was a caste which was surrounded by ferocious tribes and which itself was no less ferocious

 He himself indulged in his violent attitude, condemning laziness and cruelty towards which the public was naturally oriented
 bible ne abraham sareekhe raktpipasu, bhayankar hinsak raajaaon or asabhy raniyon ke vishay main bhi darshaya he
 It is the code of historical events and dates of the public
 kisi granth kii aprihaary laghu simaaon main yah vastut: ek jaateey itihaas hote hue bhi aashcharyachakit kar denevaale satyon se paripurna hai
 An abrupt change is seen with the end of the ancient religion
 itihaas vahi rahata he kintu uski prakruti badal jaati he
 The terrible God of the Jews is removed, and in the imagination a loving God of the Indian way emerges
 kadachit ek aisi hi pravriti ke pratham dhundle chitra swayan pracheen dharmaniyam ke hridayadesh ke madhya kuch avtaron main, visheshkar isaiyah aadi main paae jate hai
 But in relation to God, it is not a proportional fantasy of Hebrews

 But when Jesus asked him to turn his left cheek in front of the slap on his right cheek, he could not understand such revolutionary philosophy and the rejection of violence
 is prakaar unhone is naveen dharmik dharna ke lekhak ko amaanya ghoshit kar diya or antat: unhen shuli de di
 But on that day, a stream of blood flowed from the cross at a place called Galgotha gave birth to a new religion
 isai jan usko apane liye jaise ek pratik rup main dekhte hai or isa ke vachanon kaa upadesh dete hai
 Thus, patience and love, basically, conquered skin and hatred

 Then the Christians spread all over Rome, equipped with weapons of the cross

 Biblical words partially civilized those uncivilized
 is prakaar carch yaa isai dharm santhaan kam se kam hajaar varshon tak, apni sampurna vyapti ke saath europe ke man par adhikaar kiye rahaa
 Even the simplest ethics or imagination had the impression of Christianity
 kintu vahi carch jo mulat: atyaachaar or daman ke viruddh sangharsh karne ke liye viksit hua tha, ab swayan julm or nirankushta kaa sabase bada vaahak yantra ban gaya
 Again, the Bible came forward to free the public
 yah apane aap main ek virodhabhas he
 When the church was recognized because of its boundless power and the priests obliterated the cross and the Mahanth people began to take undue advantage, the public began to search for divine words again

 But Latin was not the language of the common people, other Christian leaders were greatly irritated by translations of the Bible into languages or slang dialects

 a well-known idiom is not the best medium to incite reverential sentiment and devotion or is not necessarily the supreme communicator of profound truths
 kisi na kisi prakaar carch ke duracharan se hi dharm or dharmik santhaan main nayaa sangharsh aarambh ho gaya
 In this period, as well as the rise of a new power on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean, many Christians rose westward before the rising tide of Islam

 It was a sect that taught the teachings of Jesus Christ in public and opposed the idea of church and monastery
 unka netaa vicliff adbhut saahas or paandityasampann vyakti tha
 He felt that people needed to know the teachings of Jesus for conversion
 iske liye janabhasha main bible kaa anuwaad aavashyak ho gaya
 Thus the new consciousness of that period was echoed in the voice of Wickliffe
 vicliff us samay hua tha jab angreji gadhy main bible ke purna aishwarya or saudarya ko abhivyakt karne kii bahut hi kam shakti thi
 Its own translation is very harsh

 The original version of the Hebrew verse had such a grandeur due to some of its personal characteristics, and much more important than the use was the Hebrew words of the Hebrew Bible, which were easily lost in some ancient translations
 vaakyakhand main sangya kaa ek vishesh sthaan hota he or vibhaktiyon kii aaj jaisi anivaaryta us samay thi bhi nahin, kyonki yah ek mahaan vaastavik kalpana thi jo yahudiyon kii apni thi tathaa shabdon ke prati unka samvedan marmasparshi tha
 Thus some words had strength and intensity only because those words were not applied and were in seed form

 Due to the properties of the content being interesting and short-lived, its stories, narratives, theatrical predictions, hymns, short stories all combined to form a definite shape

 Therefore, if there is a slight error or confusion in understanding them, not only the confusion increases but the whole intention becomes corrupt
 isliye isamen aashcharya nahin ki girjagharon ne anuwaadon ko uchit nahin samajha
 Nevertheless, William Tinden made the first authentic attempt at an English translation of the Bible
 usne mul italeey sanskaran kaa upyog kiya jo pandrahavin shatabdi main italy main taiyaar kiya gaya tha tathaa chaudaavin shatabdi main kiye gaye vicliff ke anuwaad kaa sahaara bhi liya tha
 For translation, he chose the simplest anglo-english words and thus presented his translation by establishing a dialogue with the language of the masses
 tindel ne iraismus or luther or zinvagli ke jurikh sanskaran kaa bhi upyog kiya tha
 Yet Tyndale's spontaneity was associated with strange experiments
 kintu tindel kii bible ke nikat hokar hi kaberdel ek mahaan dharmopadeshak tha
 He has succeeded in managing Tyndale's clarity, but has filled him with eloquence
 isi naate vah gadhy kaa asaadhaaran shilpi siddh ho jaataa he
 After 1611, several efforts were made in this direction after Coverdale

 He also took help from other translations and thus gave his authentic translation a streamlined aesthetic and musical melody Madhuri which is not possible to be found again in the English language
 isse keval yahi bhar nahin hua ki usamen ibrani kaa sahaj saundarya or tathvik shakti akshunn rahi balki uchit shabdon main, use ek "chitratmak" or gitatmak gun praapt ho gaya jo atyuttam angreji pratibha kaa parinaam he
 It has merged into the dialect of the public
 vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki uske 93 shabd angreji ke hai
 His word has never been received or learned, and there is absolutely no accepted word in translation
 aashay kaa spasht hona jaruri bhi tha kyonki ishwari pustak maane jane vaale granth main duruhata kii koi gunjaaysh nahin honi chahie thi
 Although the style needed to be colloquial so that people could understand, yet there was absolutely no place for clairvoyance
 phir, shabdon kaa saral hona bhi jaruri yaa or yatha avasar saundarya tathaa sanyam bhi apekshit tha
 All of these qualities were the preeminence in authentic translation

 As such, the ornate decoration of armor in Germany was an art that was probably brought from Italy around the end of the 15th century, shortly before Etching developed as a print-making technique
 mana jaataa he ki print taiyaar karne main upyog kii jane vaali prakriya ke rup main iskaa avishkaar osberg, germany ke danniel hoper dwaara kiya gaya tha
 Hofer was a craftsman who embellished armor in this way and used this method to print prints using iron plates
 In addition to his print, there are two certified examples of his artwork on the armor: a 1536 shield now present in Real Armeria, Madrid, and a sword housed at the Germanische National Museum in Nuremberg

 Most of his prints were relatively small - up to about six inches or 15 cm in their longest dimension, but packed with detail

 thos hard ground ek sakht momyukt block main aata he
 To use hard ground on this variety, the plate to be carved is placed on a hot plate, a kind of metal working surface that is heated
 plate garm hota he or ground ko haathon se, plate par pighalaate hue ise lagaaya jaataa he
 The ground is spread on the plate by a roller as evenly as possible
 ek baar lagaae jane ke baad eaching plate ko garm-plate se hataa diya jaataa he or ise thandha hone diya jaataa he jo ground ko sakht kar detaa he
 After the ground hardens, the artist ideally "blows" the plate with three beeswax wax tapers so that the flame blackens the ground by placing it on the plate and it is easy to see which part of the plate is exposed
 is
 dhuna karne se na keval plate kaala ho jaataa he balki mom kii thodi maatra bhi isamen mil jaati he
 The artist later scratches the ground using a pointed tool and the metal is exposed
