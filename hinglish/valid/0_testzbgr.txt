 Measuring the humidity of the atmosphere is called hygrometer
 bahut se aise padaarth hai, jaise salphurik amla, calcium chloride, phosforus pentaxide, saadhaaran namak aadi, jo jalawaashp ke shoshak hote hai
 Using these, chemical humidiometers are made, by which the amount of water vapor present in a certain volume of air is determined in grams
 ek bottle main phosforus pentaxide or do teen naliyon main calcium chloride bharkar taul lete hai
 Then, add this bottle to a series of air conditioners
 chooshak chaalu kar dene par jal girtaa he or rikt sthaan main hawa bottle tathaa naliyon ke bheetar se hokar aati he
 The aforesaid chemical substances absorb the water vapor and the dry air gets collected in the sucker
 bottle tathaa naliyaan rasinic padaarthon sahit phir tauli jaati hai
 By subtracting the first weight from it, the amount of water vapor, which was within the collected air, is known
 aise yantra dwaara ardrata kaa pataa badi sookshmata se lagaaya ja saktaa he, parantu parinaam praapt karne main samay lagata he
 Other hygrometers are known as Dine, Daniel or Reno
 inke dwaara ham osank gyaat karte hai
 Then you can find relative humidity by looking at the table of Reno, the value of the vapor pressure at this dew point and the temperature of the air
 inke atirikt vaayu main kisi samay nami kii taatkaalik jaankaree ke liye geele or sookhe balbawale ardrathamapi kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 It is also called a psychrometer
 is upkaran main do samaan tapamapi ek hi takhte par jade rahete hai
 The cloth is wrapped on the bulb of a thermometer, which is always wet
 iske liye kapade kaa ek chor neeche rakhe hue bartan ke pani main duba rahata he
 There is evaporation of cloth water, which depends on the humidity of the air
 jab vaayu main nami kii kami hoti he to vashpibhawan adhik or iskaa mukhya ang ek bal hota he, jo newnaadhik ardrata ke anusaar ghatata-badhata he
 When there is excess of moisture in the air, the evaporation is reduced
 vashpibhawan ke anusaar geele balbawale tapamapi kaa paara neeche utar aata he or donon tapamapiyon ke paathon main antar paaya jaataa he
 This difference in their lessons depends on the amount of air humidity
 yadi vaayu jalawaashp ke santrupt ho to donon tapamapiyon ke paath ek hi rahete hai
 In Reno's table the pressure of water vapor is given to suit this difference at different temperatures, so the values of relative humidity and dew point are obtained by taking the text of both thermometers
 tapamapiyon par vaayu badalati rahe, is uddeshy se kuch cicrometeron ko ek chaal se ghumaane kaa aayojan kiya rahata he
 The plank is rotated four times per second by the motor, so that the air always changes

 In one type of device, both thermometers are held within a double metal tube and the air inside the tube is replaced by a small electric fan
 aisi dohari diwaal kii nalee se vikiranon kaa bhi prabhaav nahin padane paata
 But the humidity value cannot be determined quickly from the above hygrometers
 iske atirikt vaayu main nami kii maatra kshan-kshan par badalati rahati he tathaa hamen kshan prati kshan nami kaa pataa puure din bhar kaa jaananaa aavashyak hota he
 We cannot also study the humidity of the upper part of the atmosphere by the aforesaid instruments
 in uddeshyon kii purti ke liye bal kii lambaai par nami ke prabhaav ko dekhakar sarvapratham di sosyur ne ek ardratadarshak kaa nirmaan kiya
 This hygienist has a clean, clean hair
 bal kaa ek sira dhaatu ke tukade ke baarik chhidr main pench dwaara jakadaaa rahata he
 At the bottom, a strand of hair is wrapped on a pulley
 tab bal ke sire ko ghirani kii baari main pench dwaara jakad diya jaataa he
 a pointer is placed on the pulley axis
 bal kii lambaai badhane par ek kamaani ke kaaran ghirani ek ore or ghatane par duusari ore gumti he or uske saath sanketak vrittakar maapni par chalata he
 The calibration of the scale is done in humidity, hence the percentage of humidity on the scale can be read immediately from the location of the indicator
 isi ke aadhaar par swalekhi ardrathamapi banaae hai, jinke dwaara graph par 24 ghante athwa puure saptaah ke prayek kshan kii ardrata kaa maan ankit kiya jaataa he
 But one hair does not have enough confirmation that graphs can be written with a pointer indicator, especially when such a device is used to study the upper atmosphere in a balloon or plane
 pushtataa ke liye baalo ke guchchhe athwa rassi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 But this decreases the accuracy of the hygrometer
 dekha gaya he ki ghode kaa ek bal manushya ke baalo kii rassi se adhik upyogi hota he
 Therefore they are used, but due to another defect, it cannot be used in cold regions
 taap ghatane se jalawaashp ke prati bal kii chetanta ksheen ho jaati he
 The device is then affected by moisture after a long period of time
 -40° sein
 par to bal bilkul kunthit ho jaataa he
 Now some electrical conductive materials have been detected whose electrical barrier changes due to water vapor
 danmor ne aise ardrathamapi kaa nirmaan upree vayumandal ke adhyayan ke liye kiya he
 It has a thin layer of lithium fluoride whose electrical barrier changes due to water vapor
 yah parat vidyutparipath main lagi rahati he
 The change of the barrier causes the current to decrease, so the humidity can be read at the ruler's scale
 dharamapi ke sanketak ko swalekhi banaakar ardrata kaa maan graph par ankit bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Balloons and airplanes often have similar hygrometers

 yah julian kaaldarshak kaa roopaantaran he
 It was implemented by Pope Gregory
 isse pehle julian kaaldarshak prachlan main tha, lekin usamen anek trutiyaan thim, jinhen gregory kaaldarshak main dur kar diya gaya
 The main unit of Gregorian calendar is day
 365 dinon kaa ek varsh hota he, kintu har chauthaa varsh 366 din kaa hota he jise adhivarsh kehete hai
 The Sun-based almanac is repeated every 146,097 days
 ise 400 varshon main baanta gaya he or yah 20871 saptaah ke baraabar hota he
 In these 400 years, 303 years are common years, consisting of 365 days
 or 97 lip varsh hote hai, jiname 366 din hote hai
 Thus every year has 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes and 12 seconds
 julian calendar main 365 din 6 ghante kaa varsh mana jaataa tha, parantu aisa maanane se prayek varsh kranti-paatik saura varsh se 11 minute 14 second adhik lete hai
 This excess exceeds 3 days in 400 years
 is bhul par sarvapratham rome ke pope gregory ne sookshmtapurvak vichaar kiya
 He calculated in 1582 AD that at the time of the Dharma Sammelan of Nice city, which took place in the year 325 AD, the aforesaid excess has become 10 days, due to which the date was going back 10 days due to not being taken into account
 
 is vichaar se unhone nepulas ke jyotishi elaay sius liliyas ke paraamarsh se 1582 isvi main 5 oktober ko 15 veen oktober nishchit kiya or tab se yah niyam nikaala ki jo shatabdi varsh 4 se puri tarah vibhajit hone kii bajaay yadi 400 se puri tarah vibhajit ho tabhi use adhivarsh mana jaae anyathaa nahin
 Since this new method was started by Pope Gregory, it was called the Gregorian method or the new method
 is paddati ko bhinn-bhinn isai deshon main bhinn-bhinn varshon main sweekaar kiya gaya
 From this it is necessary to keep this in mind while reading the history of these countries
 is naveen paddati ko italy, france, spain or portugal ne 1582 i0 main, prashia, germany ke roman catholic pradesh switzraland, holland or flanders ne 1583 i0 main, poland ne 1586 i0 main, hungary ne 1587 i0 main, germany or netherland ke protestant pradesh tathaa denmark ne 1700 i0 main, british samrajya ne 1752 i0 main, japan ne 1972 i0 main china ne 1912 i0 main, bulgaria ne 1915 i0 main, turki or soviet rus ne 1917 i0 main tathaa yugoslavia or romania ne 1919 i0 main apanaaya
 After 1582 AD, in 1700 AD till 28 February, the date of the new calendar increased from the old calendar by 10 days
 1600 i0 shatabdi varsh hone se chunki 400 se puri tarah vibhajit hota tha atah vah nayi paddati se bhi adhivarsh hi hota
 Therefore, it did not increase by 1 day to differentiate the date
 taatpary yah ki puraane calendar se naye calendar main taarikh badalte hue unheen shatabdi varshon main purvokt 10 din se ek-ek din kramshah badhaayaa jayega jin shatabdi varshon main 400 se puri tarah bhaag nahin lagata
 That is, after 28 February of 1700 AD, 11 days will be added instead of 10 days to make the date of the new calendar
 isi prakaar 1800 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 12 din or 1900 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 13 din jode jaayenge
 Again, this increase will be only 13 days due to being completely divided from 400 to 2000 AD, it will not increase by an additional 1 day

 joseph fritzl kaa maamla april 2008 main prakaash main aayaa
 Elizabeth Fritzl, the daughter of accused Joseph Fritzl, accused her father, Joseph Fritzl, of imprisoning her for 24 years in the basement of his own home and subjecting her to physical, mental and sexual harassment
 uske pita dwaara uske saath banaae gayi aniatik sambandho ke chalate uski 7 santaanen hui or ek garbhpaat

 The other three children were reared by Fritzl and his wife Rosemary
 in teen bacchon ke sambandh main usne ye bahaanaa banaaya kii ye teenon use sadak par pade hue mili
 On August 24, 1984, Elizabeth's father called her for help to put a door in the basement and knocked Ether into a hidden little cellar, and she remained there until the day of her release on April 26, 2008

 Part of the category of buddha dharm bharat kii shraman parampara se niklaa dharm or mahaan darshan he
 Buddhism was founded by Gautama Buddha in the 6th century BCE
 buddha kaa janm 563 isa purv main lumbini, nepal or mahaparinirvana 483 isa purv kushinagar, bharat main hua tha
 In the next five centuries of his Mahaparinirvana, Buddhism spread throughout the Indian subcontinent and in the next two thousand years also spread across the central, eastern and southeastern Jambu continent
 buddha dharm main chaar pramukh sampradaay hai: hinayan, therwaad, mahayan, vajrayan or navyan, parantu buddha dharm ek hi he evam sabhi buddha sampradaay buddha ke siddhanth hi maanate he
 Buddhism is the second largest religion in the world after Christianity, nearly 2 billion people in the world are followers of Buddhism
 kintu, america ke pu research ke anusaar, vishwa main lagbhag 54 karod log buddha dharm ke anuyaayi he, jo duniya kii aabaadi kaa 7% hissaa he
 Pew Research has reported a very small number of Buddhists from China, Japan and Vietnam, although these countries are the top three countries with the highest Buddhist population
 duniya ke 200 se adhik deshon main buddha anuyaayi hai
 But Buddhism is a 'major religion' religion in a total of 18 countries including China, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Mongolia, Tibet, Laos, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, Singapore, South Korea and North Korea
 bharat, nepal, america, australia, indonesia, rus, bruneii, malaysia aadi deshon main bhi lakhon or karodon buddha anuyaayi hai
 Buddha's real name was Siddhartha
 unka janm kapilwastu ke paas lumbini main hua tha
 In this place, Emperor Ashoka built a pillar in the memory of Buddha in the third century BC
 siddharth ke pita shaakyon ke raja shuddhodan the
 According to the traditional tale, Siddhartha's mother Mahamaya died some time after his birth
 kaha jaataa he ki unka naam rakhane ke liye 8 rishiyo ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha, sabhi ne 2 sambhaavnaayen bataai thi, ve ek mahaan raja banenge ve ek sadhu yaa parivrajak banenge
 Hearing this speech, King Shuddhodana tried hard not to allow Siddhartha to become a monk to the extent of his ability
 shaakyon kaa apana ek sangh tha
 At the age of twenty, every Shakya Tarun had to be initiated into Shakya Sangha and become a member of the Sangh
 siddharth gautam jab bees varsh ke huye to unhone bhi shakyasang kii sadsyta grahan kii or shakyasang ke niyamanusaar siddharth ko shakyasang kaa sadsy bane huye aath varsh vyateet ho chuke the
 He was a very devoted and firm member of the Sangh
 sangh ke maamalon main ve bahut ruchi rakhte the
 His conduct as a member of the Sangh was an example and he made himself dear to everyone
 sangh kii sadsyta ke aathven varsh main ek aisi ghatana ghati jo shuddhodan ke parivaar ke liye dukhad ban gayi or siddharth ke jivan main sankatpurna sthiti paidaa ho gayi
 Adjacent to the kingdom of the Shakyas was the kingdom of the Kolis
 rohni nadi donon rajyon kii vibhaajak rekha thi
 Both Shakya and Koli used to irrigate their fields with the waters of the Rohini River
 har fasal par unka aapas main vivaad hota tha ki koun rohinee ke jal kaa pehle or kitna upyog karegaa
 These disputes sometimes turned into fights and battles
 jab siddharth 28 varsh ke the, rohni ke pani ko lekar shakya or coliyon ke naukaron main jhagada hua jisamen donon ore ke log ghayal huye
 On finding out the quarrel, Shakyas and Kolis thought that why should this dispute be resolved by war forever
 shaakyon ke senapati ne coliyon ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke prashn par vichaar karne ke liye shakyasang kaa ek adhiveshan bulaayaa or sangh ke samaksh yuddh kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Siddharth Gautam opposed this proposal and said that war does not solve any question, war will not serve any purpose, it will lead to the planting of another war
 siddharth ne kaha meraa prastaav he ki ham apane main se do aadmi chune or coliyon se bhi do aadmi chunane ko kahen
 Then these four together choose a fifth man
 ye paanchon aadmi milakar jhagade kaa samaadhaan karen
 Siddharth's proposal was invalidated by a majority, and Shakya Senapati's proposal for war was passed by an overwhelming majority
 shakyasang or shakya senapati se vivaad na sulajhane par antatah siddharth ke paas teen vikalp aaye
 Among the three options, he had to choose one option, joining the army, participating in war, agreeing to social boycott of his family and the confiscation of his fields, hanging or accepting expulsion
 unhone teesraa vikalp chunaa or parivrajak banakar desh chhodane ke liye raji ho gaye
 Siddhartha first started finding answers to his questions with the five Brahmins by becoming a Parivrajaka
 ve uchit dhyaan hasil kar paae, parantu unhen apane prashnon ke uttar nahin mili
 Then he tried to do penance
 ve is kaary main bhi ve apane guruon se bhi zyaada, nipun nikle, parantu unhe apane prashnon ke uttar fir bhi nahin mili
 Then he gathered some companions and went on to do more rigorous penance
 aise karte karte chah varsh baad, bina apane prashnon ke uttar paaen, bhukh ke kaaran mrityu ke kareeb se guzare, ve fir kuch or karne ke bare main sochane lage
 At this time, he remembered a moment of his childhood, when his father was starting to prepare the farm
 us samay ve ek anand bhare dhyaan main pad gayi the or unhe aisa mahasoos hua tha ki samay sthir ho gaya he
 Leaving hard austerities, he found an asexual path, which is also called the middle path, because this path is in the midst of both the austerities and the greatness of incontinence
 apane badan main kuch shakti daalane ke liye, unhone ek bakrii-vaale se kuch doodh le liya
 He sat under a peepal tree, promising that he would not rise without knowing the truth
 35 kii umr par, unhone bodhi pai or ve buddha ban gayi
 His first sermon was in Sarnath near Varanasi
 apane baaki ke 45 varsh ke liye, gautam buddha ne ganga nadi ke aas-paas apana dharmopadesh diya, dhanwaan or kangaal logon dono ko
 He also founded a union of two ascetics who continued to spread the sermon of the Buddha
 tripitak buddha dharm kaa mukhya granth he
 It is written in Palibhasha
 yah granth buddha ke parinirvana ke pashchaat buddha ke dwaara diya gaya upadeshau ko sutarabaddh karne kaa sabase vrihad prayaas he
 The sermon of Buddha is presented as a sutra in this book
 sutron ko varg main baandha gaya he
 The wag is included in the body or in the section
 nikaayon ko pitak main ekikrut kiya gaya he
 In this way three Pitakas are formed whose combination is called tri-pitaka
 palibhasha kaa tripitak theravaadi buddha parampara main srilanka, thailand, burma, laos, cambodia, bharat aadi raashtra ke buddha dharm anuyaayi paalna karte he
 Pali's Tipitaka is also translated into Sanskrit, which is called Tripitaka
 sanskrit kaa purna tripitak abhi anuplabdh he
 Presently the surviving tradition of Sanskrit Tripitaka Purpose is available only in the Newar caste of Nepal
 is ke alaava tibet, china, mongolia, japan, korea, vietnam, malaysia, rus aadi desh main sanskrit mul mantra ke saath main sthaneey bhashaa main buddha sahitya parampara paalna karte he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 tathagat buddha ne apane anuyaayion ko chaar aryasaty, ashtangik maarg, das parmita, panchasheel aadi shikshaaon ko pradaan kiye hai
 The first sermon of the Tathagata Buddha, which he had given to some of his sages, was about these four Aryan truths
 buddha ne chaar arya satya bataaye hai
 There is sorrow in this world
 janm main, boode hone main, beemaari main, maut main, priyatam se dur hone main, naapsand chizon ke saath main, chahat ko na paane main, sab main dukh he
 Trishna, or desire, is the cause of sorrow and continues the world with renewed vigor
 trishna se mukti pai ja sakati he
 Salvation from craving can be attained by living according to the ascendant path
 saanchaa:main:ashtangik maarg According to Buddhism, the Arya Ashtanga Path of the Fourth Arya Truth is the way to stop suffering
 gautam buddha kehete the ki chaar arya satya kii satyata kaa nishchay karne ke liye is maarg kaa anusaran karnaa chahie : 1
 Right view: Believing in the Four Noble Truths 2
 Right resolutions: Promising mental and moral development 3
 Right speech: Do not speak harmful things and lie 4
 Right actions: Do not do harmful actions 5
 Right life: Any Do not even directly or indirectly do harmful business 6
 Right efforts: Trying to improve oneself 7
 Right memory: Trying to get mental ability to see with clear knowledge 8
 Yk tombstone: Achieve Nirvana and loss of self kuch log arya ashtaang maarg ko path kii tarah samajhate he, jisamen aage badhane ke liye, pichley ke str ko paanaa aavashyak he
 And people feel that the levels of this passage are found all together
 maarg ko teen hisson main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he : pragna, sheel or samadhi
 Lord Buddha has taught his followers to follow the five Shilohs
 pali main – panatipaata vermani sikkhapadam sammaadiami ! Meaning - i take the instruction to be free from animal violence
 paali main – adinnadana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to keep away from theft
 paali main – kamesoomichhachara vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to desist from adultery
 paali nen – musavada vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to refrain from lying
 paali main – surameray majjapamadthatana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami
 Meaning - i take the education of drinking liquor, raw liquor and abstaining from intoxicants
 gautam buddha se pai gai gyaanata ko bodhi kehalaate he
 It is believed that only after getting Bodhi can be rid of the world
 sari parmitaaon kii nishpatti, chaar arya satyon kii puri samaj or karm ke nirodh se hi bodhi pai ja sakati he
 At this time, greed, guilt, fascination, avidya, craving and belief in the soul all disappear
 bodhi ke teen str hote he shravakbodhi, pratyekbodhi or samyaksambodhi
 Samyakasambodhi is considered the most advanced ideal of Buddhism
 gautam buddha ke mahaparinirvana ke baad, buddha dharm ke alag-alag sampradaay upasthit ho gayi hai, parantu in sab ke bahut se siddhant milte hai
 All Buddhist sects follow the basic principles of the Tathagata Buddha
 prathithyasamutpaada kaa siddhant kahata he ki koi bhi ghatana keval duusari ghatnaon ke kaaran hi ek jatil kaaran-parinaam ke jaal main vidyaman hoti he
 For beings, it means the cycle of infinite worlds according to karma and vipak
 kyonki sab kuch anitya or anaatman hota he, kuch bhi sach main vidyaman nahin he
 Every event is basically zero
 parantu, maanav, jinke paas gyaan kii shakti he, trishna ko, jo dukh kaa kaaran he, tyagkar, trishna main nasht kii hui shakti ko gyaan or dhyaan main badalakar, nirvana paa sakate hai
 Everything in this world is transitory and mortal
 kuch bhi sthaayee nahin
 But there is opposition from Vedic faith
 aatma kaa arth 'mai' hota he
 However, beings are made of body and mind, which do not have stability
 kshan-kshan badlaav hota he
 Therefore, there is no permanent thing called 'I' meaning soul
 jise log aatma samajhate hai, wo chetana kaa avichhinn pravaah he
 The mind has replaced the soul
 buddha ne brahm-jaal suta main sristi kaa nirmaan kaisaa hua, ye bataaya he
 The creation is created and destroyed again and again
 ishwar yaa mahabrahma sristi kaa nirmaan nahi karte kyonki duniya prathithyasamutpaada arthath kaarykaran-bhav ke niyam par chalati he
 According to Lord Buddha, karma is responsible for the grief and happiness of humans, not God or Mahabrahma
 par anya jagah buddha ne sarvocch satya ko avarnaneey kaha he
 Nothingness is the predominant philosophy of the Mahayana Buddhist sect
 vah apane hi sampradaay ke logon ko mahatv dete hai
 Buddhism does not mean pessimism
 dukh kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he, lekin saapekshavaad or yatharthwaad he
 Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are the three triratnas of Buddhism
 bhikshu, bhikshuni, upsakaa or upsika sangh ke chaar avyav hai
 The full observance of the ten parameters is called the Bodhisattva
 bodhisattva jab das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kar lete hai tab "buddha" kehalaate hai
 Becoming a Buddha is the culmination of a Bodhisattva's life
 is pahchaan ko bodhi naam diya gaya he
 Buddha Shakyamuni is said to have only one Buddha - there were many before him and there will be more in the future
 unka kahana tha ki koi bhi buddha ban saktaa he agar vah das parmitaaon kaa purna paalan karte hue bodhisattva praapt kare or bodhisattva ke baad das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kare
 The ultimate goal of Buddhism is the end of suffering from the entire human society
 "main keval ek hi padaarth sikhaata hoon - dukh he, dukh kaa kaaran he, dukh kaa nirodh he, or dukh ke nirodh kaa maarg he" 
 Followers of Buddhism walk on the asexual path and live according to it and try to get rid of ignorance and sorrow and attain nirvana
 buddha dharm main sangh kaa bada sthaan he
 In this religion Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are called 'triratna'
 sangh ke niyam ke bare main gautam buddha ne kaha tha ki chote niyam bhikshugan parivartan kar sakate he
 After their Mahaparinirvan, there was a huge increase in the size of the Sangh
 is vruddhi ke pashchaat vibhinn kshetra, samskruti, saamaajik avasthaa, diksha, aadi ke aadhaar par bhinn log buddha dharm se aabaddh hue or sangh kaa niyam dhire-dhire parivartan hone laga
 At the same time, in the Kalam Sutta of Angushava Nikaya, Buddha has given freedom to practice religion on the basis of his experience
 atah, vinay ke niyam main parimarjan / parivartan, sthaneey saanskrithik / bhashik paksh, vyaktigat dharm kaa swatantrata, dharm ke nishchit paksh main zyada vaa kam jod aadi kaaran se buddha dharm main vibhinn sampradaay vaa sangh main parimarjeet hue
 Presently, the major sect or creed in these sanghas are Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana
 bharat main buddha dharm kaa navyan sampradaay he jo purnat shuddh, maanavtaavaadi or vigyaanvaadee he
 Template: Main: Theravada saanchaa:main:mahayan Template: Main: Vajrayana saanchaa:main:navyan Five main shrines are considered to be main for followers of Lord Buddha around the world: yah sthaan nepal kii tarai main nautanwaan railway stesan se 25 kilometre or gorakhpur-gonda line ke naugarh stesan se kareeb 12 kilometre dur he
 Now a paved road has also been built from Naugarh to Lumbini
 isa purv 563 main rajkumaar siddharth gautam kaa janm yaheen hua tha
 However, most of the ancient viharas of Buddha's time here have been destroyed
 keval samraat ashok kaa ek stambh avshesh ke rup main is baat kii gavaahi detaa he ki bhagwaan buddha kaa janm yahaan hua tha
 Apart from this pillar there is a statue of Buddha in a Samadhi Stupa
 nepal sarkaar ne bhi yahaan par do stupa or banawaye hai
 Even after wandering near various places and various gurus for six years, Buddha did not get the ultimate knowledge anywhere
 iske baad ve gaya pahunche
 In the end, he vowed that until real knowledge is available, he will not rise from under the Peepal tree, even if he dies
 iske baad kareeb chah din tak din raat ek pipal vriksh ke neeche bhukhe-pyaase tap kiya
 Eventually he attained supreme knowledge or wisdom
 siddharth gautam ab buddhatv paakar akaash jaise anant gyani ho chuke the
 Where does the Pipal tree under which he sits, go to the Bodhi tree i
e
 the tree of knowledge
 vahiin gaya ko tak bodhgaya ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 It is six kilometers from Banaras Cantonment station, three and a half kilometers from banaras-city station and Sarnath four kilometers from Sadak Marg
 yah purvottar railway kaa stesan he or banaras se yahaan jane ke liye sawari tanga or rickshaw aadi milte hai
 Sarnath has a Buddhist-hospice
 yah buddha tirth he
 Millions of Buddhist followers and people interested in Buddhism reach here every year
 buddha anuyaayion ke yahaan har saal aane kaa sabase bada kaaran yah he ki bhagwaan buddha ne apana pratham upadesh yaheen diya tha
 Centuries ago, he started the dharma-chakra-praman from this place
 buddha anuyaayi sarnath ke mitti, pathar evam conkaron ko bhi pavitra maanate hai
 Scenic objects of Sarnath include Chaturmukh Singh pillar of Ashoka, ancient temple of Lord Buddha, Dhamek Stupa, Chaukhandi Stupa, etc
 kushinagar buddha anuyaayion kaa bahut bada pavitra tirth sthal he
 Lord Buddha attained Mahaparinirvana in Kushinagar itself
 kushinagar ke sameep hiranyavati nadi ke sameep buddha ne apni aakhri saans lee
 He was cremated near Rambhar Stupa
 uttar pradesh ke jila gorakhpur se 55 kilometre dur kushinagar buddha anuyaayion ke alaava paryaton premiyon ke liye bhi khaas aakarshan kaa centre he
 At the age of 80, a large number of people came to meet Buddha before he left his body
 mana jaataa he ki 120 varshiya brahman subhadr ne buddha ke vachanon se prabhavit hokar sangh se judye kii ichha jataai
 Subhadra is believed to have been the last monk whom the Buddha initiated
 dikshabhumi, nagpur maharashtra rajya ke nagpur shahar main sthit pavitra evam mahatvapurn buddha tirth sthal he
 Buddhism remained in India until the 12th century, after pacifist Buddhism diminished due to violent clashes between Hindus and Muslims, and as Buddhism disappeared from India in the 12th century
 12ve se 20ve shatabdhi tak himalayan pradeshon ke alaava pure bharat main buddha dharm ke anuyaayion kii sankhya bahoot hi kam rahi
 However, Dr
 Babasaheb Ambedkar, a Dalit scholar, initiated Buddhism in the mid-20th century on the day of Ashoka Vijayadashami on October 14, 1956, with his wife, Dr
 Savita Ambedkar himself, and then brought his 5,00,000 Hindu Dalit supporters to Buddhism
 Started religion
 buddha dharm kii diksha dene ke liye babasaheb ne trisharan, panchasheel evam apni 22 pratigyaane apane nav-baudhon ko di
 The next day Babasaheb then made 3,00,000 people Buddhist by giving Dhamma initiation on October 15 in Nagpur, on the third day, on October 16, Babasaheb went to Chandrapur to give initiation, there also he gave initiation of Buddhist Dhamma to 300,000 people
 is tarah sirf teen din main dow babasaheb ambedkar ne 10,00,000 se adhik logon ko buddha dharm kii deeksha dekar vishwa ke baudhon ko jansankhya 10 lakh badhaa di
 It is considered to be the world's largest religious conversion or conversion
 buddha vidwaan, bodhisattva dow babasaheb ambedkar ne bharat main buddha dharm kaa punarutthan kiya

 Stanford science went through three phases of experimental direction during that time
 In the early 1950s, the department remained fixed in the traditional independence and self-directed research mode, eschewing interdisciplinary cooperation and excessive government funding
 In the mid-1950s and mid-1960s, the focus of biological research was shifted between the molecular level
 Then, from the late 1960s onward, Stanford's goal became the pursuit of experimental research and humanistic completion
 Each phase was prevented by major social issues, such as the rise of the Cold War, the introduction of Spatnik, and public concern over the increasing misuse of medicine

 From the 1890s, the university's masters saw its goal as serving the West and accordingly built the school
 At the same time, the perceived exploitation of the West for Eastern interests led to similar efforts of boosters to build a self-sufficient local indigenous industry
 Thus, in the first fifty years of Silicon Valley's development, regionalism helped to connect Stanford's interests with the region's high-tech companies
 During the first half of the 20th century, the West's distinctive regional ethos is a component of Silicon Valley's already prepared environment, a component that future replicators ignore at their peril
