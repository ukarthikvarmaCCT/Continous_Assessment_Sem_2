 paripathon main ghatak do prakaar se jode ja sakate hai:shreneekram or samanantarkram main
 a circuit in which all components are connected in series can be called a parallel circuit and a circuit in which all components are connected in parallel
 shrenee paripath main harek ghatak se samaan dhara pravaahit hoti he, jabaki samanaantar paripath main harek ghatak par samaan voltata uplabdh hoti he
 Each component in the series circuits must operate, otherwise the circuit will break
 shreneekram paripathon main koi bhi ghatak kharaab hone par bhi shesh ghatak kaary karte rahenge, kintu kisi bhi ghatak ko short circuit hone par puraa paripath short-circuit ho saktaa he
 If a resistance of 10 ohms is required at some place in a circuit but it is not available but two resistors of 5–5 ohms are accessible, then they can be added in series
 isi prakaar yadi 20-20 om ke do pratirodh uplabdh hone par unhen samaantarkram main jod dene se 10 om kaa tulya pratirodh praapt ho jaataa he
 Hundreds of bulbs that can bear one and a half to two volts are added to the series and they are illuminated by 230 volts of domestic electricity

 Different types of components in circuits can also be connected in series or in order, for example, to protect a diode, a suitable value is fused in its series; Or a switch is inserted in its hierarchy to turn the fan on / off
 isi tarah kisi vidyut-apaghattiya sandharitra main ulti disha main voltata na lag jaye iske liye uske samaantarkram main ek diod daal diya jaataa he
 If a diode that can carry 2 ampere current can be installed at some place, then putting two ampere current carrying diodes in parallel can also work
 jab vidyut ke do yaa adhik ghatak is prakaar jode jate hai ki sabamein ek hi dhara pravaahit ho to ise shreneekram kehete hai
 That is, all the components connected in the hierarchy have a uniform current at each moment
 kintu un alag-alag ghatakon ke siron ke bich kaa vibhavaantar un ghatakon ke vidyutiya gunon par nirbhar hoti he
 For example, if three resistors of 10 ohm, 20 ohm and 50 ohm are connected in series and a 2 ampere current is flowing in the 10 ohm resistor, then 2 ampere current will be flowing in the resistors of 20 ohm and 50 ohm also
 
 kintu in teenon pratirodhakon ke vibhavaantar alag-alag honge
 Two or more 'double-headed' electrical components connected in parallel order have the same potential difference between the ends of each, but the current flowing through them can be different depending on the resistance, inductance, capacitance and other things of those components

 Since then, modern synthesis has been put forward to explain biological phenomena at the full and integrated scale of the biological hierarchy, from genes to species

 In the light of discoveries made since the beginning of the 21st century and in recent decades, some biologists have argued for an extended evolutionary synthesis, that is, non-genetic inheritance modes, such as epigenetics, ancestral influences, ecological and cultural heritage, And transcendence adhik jaankaree: anuvanshiki, anuvanshiki, anuvanshikta, or pratikriya ke aadarshon kaa parichay The DNA structure bases are in the center, surrounded by phosphate-sugar chains in a double helix

 vanshanukramit gun jin dwaara niyantrit hote hai or jeevon ke jinom ke bheetar jin kaa puraa set isaki ginotip kehalaata he
 The complete set of unique traits that make up the structure and behavior of an organism is called a phenotype
 These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment
 natijatan, ek jeev ke phenotype ke kai pahaluon ko viraasat main nahin miltaa he
 For example, there is an interplay between a person's genotype and sunlight; Thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children
 However, due to differences in genotypic variation some people can tan more easily than others; a striking example, are those who are the inherited qualities of bbinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn
 anuvanshik jaankaree diene ke madhyam se ek peedi se duusare ke paas ja sakate hai, ek anu jo anuvanshik jaankaree ko encode karte hai
 DNA is a long biopolymer composed of four types of bases

 Before the cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the two cells will inherit the DNA sequence as a result

 The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a location
 agar kisi vyakti ke bich ek sthaan par diene anukram bhinn hota he, to is anukram ke vibhinn roopon ko elils kaha jaataa he
 DNA sequences can be altered through mutations, creating new alleles
 yadi ek jin ke bheetar ek utparivartan hota he, to nae elil ko prabhavit kar sakate hai ki jin ke niyantran, jeev ke phenotip ko badalte hai
 However, while in some cases this simple correspondence between alleles and a trait, most traits are more complex and quantitative properties are controlled by loci

 a significant portion of phenotypic variation in the population is due to genotypic variation
 aadhunik vikasvaadi sanshleshan is anuvaanshik vividhta main samay ke saath parivartan ke rup main vikaas ko paribhaashit karata he
 The frequency of a particular allele will become more or less prevalent to other variants of that gene
 jab ek nayaa elil nirdhaaran ke bindu tak pahunch jaataa he to bhinnata gaayab ho jaati he-jab yah yaa to aabaadi se gaayab ho jaati he yaa puraani elil ko puri tarah badal detii he
 Natural selection will only cause growth if there are substantial genetic changes in the population
 mendelion anuvanshiki kii khoj se pehle, ek saamaanya avadharana viraasat ko sammishrit kar rahaa tha
 But with blending inheritance, genetic variation will be rapidly lost, making evolution impossible by natural selection

 Despite the continuous introduction of new variations through mutation and gene flow, most genomes of a species are the same in all individuals of that species
 haalanki, ginotip main apekshaakrit chote antar bhi phenotip main naatakeey antar paidaa kar sakate hai: udhaaharan ke liye, chimpanji or insaan apane jeenomon main se lagbhag 5% main antar karte hai
 Main article: Mutation ek gunasutra ke hisse kaa doharaavamuteshan koshika ke jinom ke diene anukram main parivartan hai
 When mutations occur, they can alter the product of a gene, or prevent the gene from functioning, or have no effect
 udo drosophila melenogaster main padhai ke aadhaar par, yah suzav diya gaya he ki yadi koi jin jin dwaara nirmit protein main parivartan karata he, to yah sambhawatah hanikaarak hoga, inamen se lagbhag 70% muteshan hanikaarak prabhaav padataa he, or shesh tatasth yaa kamjor rup se laabhakaari
 Mutations can involve repeating large sections of a chromosome, which may introduce additional copies of a gene into the genome
 jin kii atirikt pratiyaan viksit karne ke liye nae jeenon ke liye aavashyak kachche maal kaa ek pramukh strot hai
 This is important because most genes evolve from pre-existing genes into gene families, which share common ancestors

 Sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of development
 yah aarekh sex kii dohari laagat ko darshata he
 If each individual were to contribute the same number of offspring, the sexual population remains the same size as each generation, where the reproductive population doubles in size for each generation
 sex kii do guna laagat pehle jon menard smith dwaara varnit thi
 The first cost is that only one of the two sexes may be young in a sexually mature species
 
 The second cost is that anyone who reproduces sexually can only give 50% of the genes to any different offspring, along with every new generation

 It may therefore be a source of diversity that is new to the population or a species
 Gene flow may be due to the movement of individuals between different populations of organisms, as the movement of mice or grasses between inland and coastal populations

 Main article: Natural selection natural sellection ke madhyam se vikaas prakriya he jiske dwaara jansankhya kii lagaataar pidiyon main astitv main vruddhi or prajnan adhik saamaanya ho jate hai
 It is often called the "self-sustaining" mechanism because it is necessary that according to three simple facts: akruti vigyaan, sharir vigyaan or vyavhaar ke sambandh main jeevon kii aabaadi ke bheetar bhinnata maujuud he
 Different traits provide different rates of survival and reproduction
 in lakshanon ko peedi se peedi tak paarit kiya ja saktaa he
 More offspring can be produced than survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction
 natijatan, un gunon ke saath jeevashm jo unhen apane pratidwandviyon par ek laabh de dete hai, unke gunon ko agali peedi tak un gunon ke saath paarit karne kii sambhaavna he jo ek laabh pradaan nahin karte hai
 The main concept of natural selection is the ability to develop an organism
 swasthya ko jivit rahane or punarutpaadan karne kii kshamta ke dwaara mapa jaataa he, jo agali peedi main iske anuvanshik yogadan kaa aakaar nirdhaarit karata he
 However, fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring: fitness is instead indicated by the proportion of later generations that carry the genes of an organism
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi koi jeev acchhee tarah se jivit rah saktaa he or tezi se prajnan kar saktaa he, lekin uske vanshaj bahut chote or jivit rahane ke liye kamjor the, is jeev main bhavishya kii pidiyon main thodaa anuvaanshik yogadan hoga or is prakaar kam fitness hoga
 If alleles increase fitness more than other alleles of that gene, then this allele will become more common within the population with each generation
 in lakshanon ko "ke liye chaynit" kaha jaataa he
 Examples of symptoms that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased fertility
 Conversely, this allele has less beneficial or harmful allyl consequences resulting in reduced fitness - these have been selected against "
 " mahatvapurn baat, elil kii fitness ek nishchit visheshta nahin he; agar paryaavaran main parivartan, pehle tatasth yaa hanikaarak lakshan phydemand ho sakate hai or pehle laabhakaari gun hanikaarak ho jate hai
 However, even if the direction of selection is reversed in this way, symptoms lost in the past may not re-develop into a uniform form
 ek visheshta ke liye aabaadi ke bheetar prakritik chayan, jo vibhinn prakaar ke mulyon jaise oonchai par bhinn ho sakate hai, ko teen alag-alag prakaaron main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he pehla dishaatmak chayan hota he, jo ki samay ke saath ek vishesh gun ke ausat mulya main badlaav hota he- udhaaharan ke liye, jeev dhire-dhire oonche ho jate hai
 Second, disruptive selection is selection for highly trait values and often becomes the most common of the two different values, with selection against the mean value
 yah tab hoga jab yaa to laghu yaa ucch jeevon kaa ek phayda hota he, lekin madhyam oonchai ke nahin hote ant main, chayan ko sthir karne main donon ore donon ore ke charam vishesh gunon ke bich chayan hota he, jo ausat mulya or kam vividhta ke aas-paas bhinnata ko kam karata he
 This, for example, causes organisms to gradually become all the same height
 natural sellection kaa ek vishesh maamla yon chayan hota he, jo kisi bhi gun ke liye chayan hota he jo sambhog kii safalataa ko badhaata he or sambhavit mitron ke jeevon ke aakarshan ko badhaata he
 Characteristics developed through sexual selection are especially prominent among males of many animal species
 yadhyapi kaamuk rup se isht, haalanki bojhil sing, sangat kol, bade sharir ke aakaar or ujjwal rang jaise lakshan aksar prerana ko aakarshith karte hai, jo ki vyaktigat purushon ke astitv se samjhauta karte hai
 This survival loss is balanced by high reproductive success in men who show these difficult-to-fake, sexually selected traits
 natural sellection sabase aam taur par swabhaav ko maapta he jiske khilaaf vyaktiyon or vyaktigat gunon ko jivit rahane kii adhik sambhaavna he
 In this sense "nature" refers to an ecosystem, namely a system in which organisms interact with all other elements in their local environment, both physically and biologically
 paristhitiki tantra ke sansthaapak ujin odum ne ek paristhitiki tantra ko paribhaashit kiya he: "kisi bhi ikai main sabhi jeevon ko shaamil kiya jaataa he

 This broad understanding of nature enables scientists to characterize specific forces that, together, include natural selection
 prakritik chayan sanghathan ke vibhinn staron par kaary kar saktaa he, jaise ki jin, koshika, vyaktigat jeev, jeevon or prajatiyon ke samooh
 Selection can work at multiple levels simultaneously

 vartmaan prajatiyaan vikaas kii prakriya main ek charan hai, unki vividhta ke saath prajati or vilupt hone kii ghatnaon kii lambii shrinkhalaa kaa utpaada he
 The common ancestry of organisms is first inferred from four simple facts about organisms: First, they have geographic distributions that cannot be explained by local adaptation

 But diplomatic history is different from international relations in the sense that under international relations, the relations of two or more states are studied while diplomatic history can be related to the foreign policy of a single state
 rajanyik itihaas kaa jhukaav adhikanshtah rajnay ke itihaas kii ore hota he jabaki antararashtriya sambandh samasamyik ghatnaon par adhik dhyaan detaa he
 Diplomacy is an art which the state of the world adopts to enhance its mutual relations and serve its interests

 yadi rajnay ke saadhan tathaa lakshyon ke bich asangati rahati he to isse desh kamjor hota he, badnaam hota he tathaa uski anterrashtriya pratishtha gir jaati he
 With this view, each state should adopt such means which can create goodwill and trust in other states
 iske liye yah aavashyak he ki rajya apni nitiyon ko spasht rup se samajhaaye, duusare rajyon ke nyyochit daavon ko manyata de tathaa eemaandareepurn vyavhaar kare
 Dishonest and tactful diplomats succeed in short term goals but overall they remain at a loss
 duusare rajyon main unke prati avishvaas paidaa hota he tathaa ve sajag ho jate hai
 Hence the importance of diplomatic methods
 rajnay ke sadhano kaa nirnay lete samay yah dhyaan rakhana chaiye ki iskaa mukhya uddeshy rajya ke pramukh hiton kii raksha karnaa he
 The same purpose is also for the diplomacy of other states

 It is the rule of agreement and bargaining that to get anything one has to pay something
 yah aadan-pradaan rajnay kaa ek vyaavhaarik satya he
 There are also instances in history when a powerful big state forced the other weak state to accept its own arbitrary terms and instead adopted a path of unilateral compulsion by not adopting a process of compromise
 is prakaar laadi gai sharton kaa paalan sambandhit rajya keval tabhi tak karata he jab tak ki vah aisa karne ke liye majaboor ho or avasar pate hi vah unke bhaar se mukt ho jaataa he

 Here we will study the methods of diplomatic conduct adopted in Greece, Rome, Italy, France and India
 rajnay kaa itihaas unani nagar rajyon se prarambh hota he
 Political philosophers like Plato and Aristotle have written enough about the political situation of the city states and their relationship with other states
 unani sabhyataa ke praarambhik charan main nagar rajyon ke rajdooton ko agradoot kaha jaataa tha
 Their work was not limited only to negotiating treaties, but they also used to do the work of governing the state household, setting up the system in meetings and councils and performing religious ceremonies etc
 unani sabhyataa ke vikaas ke saath-saath nagar rajyon ke sambandh jatil evam sparddhapurna ban gayi
 Now for the negotiations, people who are powerful and influential speakers, who have a sharp memory and a loud voice, so that they can present the vision of their city in front of the Lok Sabhas of other city states and can affirm strongly in its favor
 
 rajanyik padon par aise vyakti ko niyukt kiya jane laga jo puratvvetta ek kushal vaktaa, raajnneetik sambandhon kaa vidhyaarthee tathaa manovaigyanik ho
 Reading the descriptions of the famous historian Thucydides, it is known that the statements of the diplomats of that time were sufficiently powerful and long-lived
 isane sparta nivaasiyon kii ek lok sabha kaa vivaran diya he jisamen sahyogiyon evam mitron ko yah tay karne ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya tha ki kya athens rajya ne apni sandhiyon kaa ulanghan kiya he or yadi kiya he to kya iske dand swaroop uske viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di jaye ? is sabha main vaktrutaaon kii samaapti ke baad yuddh kaa prastaav pehle kanth swar se or phir matganana ke aadhaar par paarit ho gaya
 The remarkable thing was that at the same time, the Athens resident delegation had come to Sparta in the context of a trade treaty and was present in the said meeting not being invited
 ise bich-bich main apana mat vyakt karne diya jaataa tha
 When the war resolution was passed, the members of this delegation became citizens of the enemy state, yet they were allowed to remain in Sparta until they had completed their treaty
 unani rajanyajna ye kaary sampann karte the - swagatakartta rajya main sambandhit soochna ekatrit karnaa, lokapriy nagar sabhaaon ke sammukh apane rajya ke hiton ke samarthan main sabhi tareeke apnaanaa, videshi rajya ke sambandh main samayik prativedan taiyaar karnaa, videshi rajya main apane rajya ke nagarikon ke hiton kii raksha karnaa aadi
 At that time, the work done by Thucydides as a diplomat is useful enough for our study
 usne vivaadon ko shantipurvak hal karne ke liye sandhivaarta or sammelanaatmak rajnay ke tareeke apanaaye
 Sparta and Athens were the oldest of the city states
 yahan anya rajyon ke saath sambandhon kii acchhee paramparaayen viksit huin
 Athens was democratic in terms of organization and spirit
 yahan vyapaarik evam samudramargeey sampark kii drushtir se nivaasiyon ko teen bhaagon main vargeekrut kiya gaya-das, videshi niwasakartta or athens ke naagarik
 Its form of contact with other states was democratic

 These city states of Greece gave diplomats many immunities and privileges
 prarambh se hi videsh sambandhon kii rachana main in rajanyikon kaa yogadan na keval mahatvapurn varan vyapak bhi tha
 The mutual relations of the Greek city states gave rise to many customs and principles
 us samay anterrashtriya kanoon apni shishu avasthaa main tha
 Naga states like Athens, Sparta and Thebes developed mutual relations keeping in mind their internal policy, convenience and security related strategy
 aadhunik anterrashtriya sandhiyon ke bich tatkaaleen dharmik or raajnneetik sanghon main dekhe ja sakate he
 At that time, traditions such as the inerrancy of diplomats, the right to asylum, the ceasefire for cremation of the dead and the religious fairs and stopping the tension during play were adopted
 nagar rajyon kii janpriya sabhaaon main videshon se swadansh ke rajdooton dwaara bheje gayi prativednon par aalochanatmak vichaar kiya jaataa tha
 Necessary instructions were given after considering the problems presented by their suggestions

 With a view to regularizing international life, two processes developed by the Greeks are notable - unani nagar rajyon ke rajanyik vyavhaar ko sankshep main nimna prakaar varnit kiya ja saktaa he- Criticizing Greek period diplomacy, it is sometimes said that the Greeks were unfamiliar with the notion of international morality, without which even the best diplomatic device proved to be inactive, on average, the Greeks' loyalty to the city state was so deep that it Other city states considered the residents as potential slaves and the remaining rude as natural slaves
 rajanyik sambandhon kii vibhinn ullekhneey dharanaon ke hote hue bhi unaniyon kaa rajanyik aachaar kai drushtirayon se doshapurn tha- In short, the Greeks had made considerable progress in the field of diplomatic conduct
 roman log unaniyon kii tulana main adhik barbar the
 Therefore, they could not develop international relations
 unaniyon ne sandhi vaarta paddati ko viksit kiya tha or rajanyik prakriya ke madhyam se virodhiyon se sampark sthapit karne main vishwaas vyakt kiya tha, kintu roman logon ne sainik shakti par adhik vishwaas kiya
 He was more a winner than a diplomat
 roman logon ne rajanyik taur-tareekon ke sthaan par sidhi kaarywahi par adhik vishwaas kiya
 In order to maintain their supremacy, they adopted the method that they would favor the weak in times of conflict between two or more nations, as they believed that this policy would allow both sides to be witnesses of Rome's political grace
 kamjor kaa paksh lene se vah to rome ke prabhaav ko maanegaa hi, kintu kamjor kaa paksh lekar jab shaktishaalee ko ukhaad phanka jaayegaa to vah shaktishaalee paksh bhi rome kaa prabhaav maanane ke liye majaboor ho jaayegaa
 The Romans formulated the principle of legalization of war in the field of diplomacy, according to which according to them, the same war was legalized for which a formal declaration was made and for which a religious ceremony was organized by a particular religious teacher
 roman log yuddh or shanti donon hi kaaryon main videshi raajnneetigyon kaa swaagat karte rahe
 They usually called the ambassador Lagetas and sometimes also Fetial
 yah shabd adhikanshah yuddh athwa shaanti ke liye vaartakar ke saath lagaaya jaataa tha
 The Roman Senate regularly sent its country's ambassadors abroad
 roman kanoon rajdooton ko anatikramyata ko manyata detaa tha
 Eminent political thinker Cicero, who came to Rome as a messenger, wrote in this regard, “the ambiguity of ambassadors is both divine and human laws
 ve pavitra or aardayee hai taaki ve anatikramya bane rahen
 It is not only in the Allies but they are also in the enemy's army
 ”under the Roman law, the ambassador's allies were also infatuated
 rajdooton ke patr-vyavhaar or unke liye anivaary vastuon ko anatikramya samajha jaataa tha
 The ambassador had the privilege of trespassing even when he passed through a third state
 rajdoot par kiya gaya koi bhi hamalaa roman antarajartiya kanoon kaa ulanghan mana jaataa tha
 The principle of territoriality was also applicable to the ambassador, meaning that the ambassador was not prosecuted in the state court for breaking any agreement, he was free from local laws
 roman seenet rajdooton ko rajkeey atithiyon jaisaa sammaan detii thi
 The Romans provided the method of a trained 'archivist' in the field of diplomacy
 puralekhpal rajanyik drushtaanton or prakriyaaon main praveen vyakti hote the
 Even today, an important branch of diplomacy is to protect and keep old articles, treaties, records etc
 roman logon ne puralekhagaaron athwa lekhon se sambandhit kaary ko ‘rajanyik vyavhaar’ kii sangya di he
 The method of keeping such articles organized is an important contribution of the Roman people
 roman logaan ne rajyon kii samanta ke siddhanth kaa kabhi aadar nahin kiya
 The reason for this was that the Romanians believed in their best, they did not consider any other state as their counterpart

 The loss of coral reefs, which are predicted to become extinct in the next century, will have huge economic effects, pose a risk to the balance of global biodiversity and increase the risk of food security for millions
 Conservation biology plays an important role in international agreements involving the world's oceans
 These predictions will undoubtedly appear extreme, but it is difficult to imagine how such changes will not come to pass without fundamental changes in human behavior
 Oceans are at risk of acidification due to increased CO 2 levels

 Many conservation biologists, along with graduating science, often receive professional recognition in their careers
 
 There is a movement in conservation biology suggesting that a new type of leadership is needed to make conservation biology a more effective subject which is capable of communicating the entire scope of the problem to the society at large
 andolan ek anukool netritv drushtikon ko prastaavit karata he joki ek anukool prabandhan drushtikon ke samanaantar he

 While most people in the conservation science community "emphasize the importance" of maintaining biodiversity, there is controversy about how to prioritize genes, species, or ecological systems, all of which are components of biodiversity
 While the dominant approach to date has been to focus efforts on endangered species by conserving biodiversity hotspots, some scientists and conservation organizations such as Nature Conservation argue that investing in biodiversity coldspots would be more cost-effective and socially relevant
 unka tark he ki khoj, namakaran or prayek prajati vitaran ke maanchitran kii laagat, ek galat sangrakshan udhyam he
 They argue that it is better to understand the importance of the ecological roles of species

 For example, "44% of all species of vascular plants and 35% of all species of four vertebrate groups are limited to 25 hotspots containing only 1
4% of the Earth's surface
 " Those who argue in favor of establishing priorities for Coldspot state that there are many other measures to consider beyond biodiversity

 The ecological footprint of the society has exceeded the bio-regenerative capacity limits of the planet's ecosystem by about 30 percent, the same percentage of vertebrate populations that have declined from 1970 to 2005
 The ecological credit crunch is a global challenge
 The Living Planet Report 2008 tells us that more than three quarters of the world’s people live in nations that are ecological debtors – their national consumption has outstripped their country’s biocapacity
 Thus, most of us are propping up our current lifestyles, and our economic growth, by drawing upon the ecological capital of other parts of the world
 The inherent natural economy plays an essential role in maintaining humanity, including global ambient chemicals, pollination crops, pest control, soil nutrient rot, purification of our water supply, supply of medicines and health benefits, and unproven quality of life improvement
 Is included
