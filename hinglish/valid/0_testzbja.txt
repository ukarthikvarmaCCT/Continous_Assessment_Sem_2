 In other words, the study of the process of converting 'word' to 'term' is called morphology
 rupavigyaan, bhashavigyaan kaa ek pramukh ang he
 Under this, various parts of the term - basic nature and prefix, suffix, inflection - are analyzed properly, so some Indian philologists have given the term "nature-suffix-idea"

 Various grammatical streams of the language are determined by these related elements
 inase hi bhashaa main ling, vachan, kaarak, purush, kaal, prashn, nishedh aadi kii abhivyakti sambhav hoti he
 According to linguists, all these grammatical streams were used along with the progressive development of the language

 dwinetri ke liye aavashyak yantric angon kaa ansamyak vikaas nahin hua rahata
 Sockets arise after three months
 inke viksit hote hi in kshetron ko sambanddh karne ke liye uddipan kii vyavastha hoti he
 By the method of trial and omission, when the object is brought together on both sockets, the child becomes very clear about the image
 phir drushtkaksh is prakaar abhisthapit hote hai ki prayek gartika drishy padaarth kii ore nideshit ho or baccha donon macula se ek saath pratyakshikaran karnaa sikhta he
 In the latter phase, the images of the two intersections merge to form a vision, and coherence becomes the instinct
 yadi ankhen kisi kaaran se, jaise kisi gartika ke viksit na ho paane yaa bahirakshipeshiyon ke sanstambh ke kaaran, sambhddha na ho paaen to drishy padaarth par donon gartikas ek saath focus nahin ho paatin or baccha do bimbon ko samekit nahin kar paata
 In these situations, the vision is always monogamous and often also reversible, or the object is ambiguous
 dwinetri drushti kaa teesraa kram gaharaai pratyakshkaran, arthath gaharaai kaa bodh, yaa avkaash main teesri vimiti kaa bodh, he
 This condition is caused by psychological and other processes
 donon aankhon ke bich parshviya duuri hoti he, jiske kaaran donon aankhon ke bimb sarvangasam nahin hote, ek aankh kaa bimb bain ore or duusari aankh kaa dahini ore jhukaa hota he
 The essential physical and psychological factors of depth perception occur at birth in humans, or develop soon after birth
 at: yadi aankh or parichaalika peshitantrika kii virachana saamaanya ho, to gaharaai kaa pratyaksh gyaan apane aap hota he
 The movement of the eyes or clarity of vision depends on the clarity of the image on the retina
 iske liye photography ke camere jaisaa netra main prakaashiki se sambandhit ang hota he, jo prakaashiki ke saamaanya niyamon kaa paalan karata he
 Translucent hygroscopy, ophthalmoscope, eye lens and vitreous fluid are the major parts of the optical system of the eye
 aankh kaa sabase bhitari samvedansheel kanchuk, arthath drushtipatal, camere kii photography-pattica ko nirupit karata he
 The suspension muscle keeps the umbilical lens in place by which it attaches to the spinal muscles
 padaarth se aanevaali kirane swachhmandal, netrod tathaa lens se paarit hoti hai or lens dwaara peeche focus ho jaati hai
 The convexity of the lens can be more or less due to automatic adjustment and a clear, real, small and inverted image is formed when the rays are focused on the retina
 drushtipatal main tantrika upakalaon kii parat hoti he, jisamen dand or shanku hote hai
 The cones predominantly converge on the macula and the penile perimeter
 ye atyadhik vibhedit koshikaaye hai or drushti antyang kaa kaam karti hai
 Similar to other sensory nerves, stimulation of these synapses also develops sensory impulses, which pass through the afferent region of the central nervous system to the brain
 pehali vaastavik sanvaahan tantrika koshika, yaa pratham shrenee kaa neuron, bhitari newcleey parat kii dvadhruvi koshika he, jiskaa akshatantu bhitari jalaster main hota he
 The retinal cells of the retina are a second-class neuron, whose processes pass into the layer of nerve fibers and pass through the astigmus, the viscera and the retina to the lateral curvature
 yahan ek nai koshika - teesri shrenee kaa neuron - dwaara aavegon kaa pareshan hota he tathaa ye aaveg akshivikiran dwaara pashchakapaal khand ke valk main, jise drushticendre bhi kehete hai, yatra karata he
 The area of the macula is most important and clear and responsible for sharpness in the entire retina
 drushti kii karyiki yaa jab prakaash drushtipatal par padataa he tab vah kisi samvedi tantrika antang kaa uddipan karata he
 Just as contact with an object from the skin is tactile
 kisi saamaanya tectile antang main upyukt uddipan se honevaale parivartan, samvedi abhivahika tantrikaon se shaareerik aaveg or mastishk main in aavegon kii manovaigyanik vyakhya saral hai
 These processes in the nervous system of vision are very complex and differentiated
 drushtipatal par padanevaala prakaash isamen yantric, prakaash-rasinic or vaidyut anukriyaayein utpann karata he
 In mechanical changes the cones become smaller and the dyes in the hematized cells begin their processes
 shanku or dand main upasthit drushti-neelarun viranjit ho jaataa he or prakaashmaan padaarth kaa ek prakaar kaa photograph, yaa drushtipatalbimb, ban jaat he
 Finally, the electrode of the retina also changes
 prakaash jab drushtipatal kaa uddipan karata he, tab teen prakaar ke samvedan hote hai : prakashasamvedan, varnsamvedan or akritisamvedan
 Illumination is the inherent power through which we can experience all kinds of intensity of light
 shankuon kii apeksha dand nimna dipti ke prati adhik samvedansheel hote hai, jiske kaaran sandhya samay ham dand se dekhte hai
 Nocturnal animal retina has fewer cones, or none at all
 yah duusari antarnihit shakti he, jo hamen bahya jagat ke padaarthon kaa pratyaksh gyaan karaati he
 It has a higher function of cones and is therefore very intense on the macula, where the cones are dense and differentiated
 vah antarnihit shakti he, jisase ham log bhinn bhinn rangon or chhayadhano main bhed kar pate hai
 It is very difficult to properly research this power, because different colors of the spectrum have different colors
 isliye is baadhak kaarak ko drushtipatal kii kayik dashaon, jaise isaki anukulan avasthaa aadi, se jod dena chahie
 These three direct knowledge are not limited to a very small region of central or macular vision
 drushtipatal ke paridhiy bhaagon main bhi ye thode bahut rahete hi hai
 In the eye examination, the sharpness of these three direct knowledge is checked
 rastha kendriya drushti kii tikshnata kii jaanch praaia: snellen ke pareekshan tipon se kii jaati he, jo 60, 36, 24, 18, 12, 9 or 6 meter panktiyaan hoti hai
 The ordinary person should not have difficulty in reading the letters of the six meter line from the beginning to the end, situated at a distance of six meters
 yadi yah duuri kam kerani pade to vyakti kii duuradrushti maani jaati he
 The last two lights are of high importance, as they manipulate the reading of the vision and hence the 100-foot standard distance is preferred
 rogi kii nikat drushti kaa pareekshan bhi aavashyak he
 It is not necessary that one who has normal vision has normal myopia, or that normal myopia's vision is also normal
 jegar nikat-pareekshan tipon se jaanch karke je1, je1 ank die jate hai
 It is like a mountain with a sea of blindness around it
 centrebindu drushtkaksh ko nirupit karata he
 The field is tested with white materials of different shapes and blue, red, yellow, green colors
 budhn tathaa prakashapath ke rogon main kshetra ke pareekshan se nidaan karne main suvidha hoti he
 Generally, the area of blue and yellow colors is 10% less than white and the area of green and red colors is even 10% less
 drushtikshetra kaa pareekshan nimnlikhit do bhaagon main kiya jaataa he : byram ke parde par kendriya kshetra kaa or perimetre par paridhisth kshetra kaa
 Of these, the central region is of greater importance and contains a projection of 30% around the stabilization point
 iskaa pareekshan photometer or abhyanukulnamaapi jaise vishesh upkarnon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 This test should not be done until the person gets used to the darkness by staying in the dark room for at least 20 minutes
 har vyakti kaa prakashbodh duusare se bhinn hota he
 Retinitis pigmentos, vitamin 'A' deficiency, and photophobia are delayed in patients with glaucoma

 Native American tribal tribes were still inhabited in many areas of the western United States in those days, and white American settlers immigrated elsewhere

 These stories often depict the confrontation of these tribes, colonists and government

 Often there was only one policeman appointed by the citizens in every city, whose post was called 'sheriff'
 vastern kahaniyon main aise samaaj kaa chithran kiya jaataa he jahaan kisi kanoonee vyavastha ke bajaay log swayan hi apni jaan, maal or izzat kii rakhwali karte hai
 Some of the themes of these stories that are frequently seen are: - in kahaniyon kaa mukhya nayak aksar apane vafaadaar ghode ke saath yahan-vahaan phirane vaala ek vir purush hota he
 In many stories, the main heroine is an underage woman, who is protected or helped by the protagonist, who eventually falls in love with her

 It was the duty of any samurai to die before his king
 agar koi raja maaraa jaataa to saamuraai kaa farz tha ke uske maarane waalon se badla le
 The situation of the master of the samurai who had died or who had expelled him from his service for some reason was considered extremely shameful and he was never again served by a king
 aise saamuraai ko ronin kehete the
 Ronin wandered from city to city
 kyonki wo jaanbaaj the or ladaai karne main nipun the, isliye kain japani kathaon main darshaya jaataa he ke kisi gaanv yaa stri par atyaachaar ho rahaa he or ek bahadur ronin aakar unki madad karata he
 There is a lot of grunt in such stories because on the one hand Ronin is deeply saddened to hate herself and on the other is her bravery and competence
 thik yahi kashmakash kaa tatv bahut si vastern filmon main bhi apanaaya gaya he
 Often there is some sadistic thing happened to the storyteller, due to which sometimes he has been completely disgraced
