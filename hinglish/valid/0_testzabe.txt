 yah gaanv-gaanv jaakar bhagwaan vishnu ke bhajan evam lok geet gaakar bhiksha magan kar apana jeevanyaapan karte hai
 But it is not necessary that every Vaishnavi sing alms and ask for alms, but only after singing a bowl, he asks for alms

 ajay nadi ke paas kenduli mela lagane kaa ek bahut bada kaaran yah ho saktaa he ki pus sakranti ke din ajay nadi jo katwa, varadaman naam sthaan par bhagirathi nadi main milti he jo ganga nadi kaa hi ek bhaag he kaa pani subah kuch kshanon ke liye ulataa bahata he

 parichay Nutan comics have many characters full of laughter and laughter, in which Chhutki's name comes at the top
 cartoonist praan kii pyaari or chulabuli si pinki kii tarah chhutki apni choti choti par mjedaar kahaniyon se bhartiya comics kii duniya main ek pahchaan banane main kaamyaab huyi thi
 Chhutki's character is that of a small naughty girl, who is always depicted wearing a red frock with yellow big dots
 bhartiya charitra ke hisaab se kaaphi ajeeb tareeke se use blond banaaya gaya he
 Anyway, the character and her stories are very funny
 chhutki kaa charitra dizin kiya tha pammi group ne, jinka naam zyaadaatar pammi bhai ke rup main diya gaya he, baad main dhammi group ne bhi saath main unhen jwine kiya tha
 As far as the stories were concerned, Premnath Sharma ji wrote them
 Chutki's comics used to have many short stories - no definite detail
 chhutki kii pehali prakashit comics kaa naam tha - chhutki List of known published comics - chitrakathao ke aavaran sangrah soon nabhikeey astr yaa parmaanu bam ek visphotak yukti he jisaki vidhvansak shakti kaa aadhaar nabhikeey abhikriya hoti he
 It can be made by nuclear fusion or nuclear fission or by the combination of both these types of nuclear reactions

 Today's nuclear weapon, slightly larger than one thousand kilos, can generate as much energy as it can generate from conventional explosives of several billion kilos

 The most powerful explosive used in World War II was the name 'blockbuster'

 The first atomic bomb, which was 2000 times more powerful than this explosive, was detonated by T
N
 T
 was equivalent to an explosion of 22,000 tons
 ab to pratham parmaanu bam se bahut adhik shaktishaalee parmaanu bam bane hai
 The detonating substance in a nuclear bomb is uranium or plutonium
 uranium yaa plutonium ke parmaanu vikhandan se hi shakti praapt hoti he
 For this, neutrons are struck in the nucleus of the atom
 is prahaar se hi bahut badi maatra main urja praapt hoti he
 This process is called physicist nuclear fission
 parmaanu ke nabhik ke abhyantar main jo neutron hote hai unheen se neutron mukt hote hai
 These neutrons strike other atoms and cause fragmentation again
 ye phir anya parmaanuon kaa vikhandan karte hai
 This is how chain actions begin

 Many isotopes of uranium are known
 saamaanya uranium main 99
3 pratishat you-238 or 0
7 pratishat you-235 rahete hai
 The fragmentation of U-238 is not as easy as the fragmentation of U-235
 you-235 main you-238 kii apeksha teen neutron kam rahete hai
 It is due to this lack of neutrons that fragmentation of U-235 occurs easily

 a nuclear explosion requires critical codes of fissile material
 shrunkhlaa kriya ke chaalu karne ke liye kranthik sanhati nunatam maatra he
 If the amount of fissile material is less than the critical code, then the neutron will only continue to crumble
 maatra ke dhire dhire badhaane se ek samay aisi avasthaa aegi jab kam se kam ek unmukt neutron ek nae parmaanu par prahaar kar uskaa vikhandan kar degaa
 On reaching such a state, the fragmentation process starts running automatically

 Svetlana had decided that her last rites would be performed in accordance with Hindu rituals
 vah brajesh singh ki asthiyaan ganga main bahaane ke liye bharat bhi laai thi
 However, the Soviet leaders tried hard to convince Svetlana not to do so
 kaha jaataa he ki us samay ke soviet pradhanmantri alexi kosigin ne unase kaha tha ki vah jokhim le rahi hai kyonki kattar hinduon main vidhwaaon ko mrit pati ke saath jalaane kii parampara he
 At the insistence, Svetlana reached India

 a volcano is a crack or mouth present on the surface of the Earth that brings out hot lava, gas, ash, etc
 inside the earth
 vastutah yah prithvi kii upree parat main ek vibhang hota he jiske dwaara andar ke padaarth baahar nikalate hai
 The conical topography formed by the deposition of these substances released by volcanoes is called volcanic mountain

 Apart from this, volcanoes are also found at some other sites which are believed to originate from mantle plume and such sites are known as hotspots

 On the other hand, environmental geography studies them as a natural disaster because it causes loss of ecosystems and life and property
 jwalamukhi Geologists are not unanimous about the activity, but if a volcano is currently erupting, or it is expected to burst soon, or if it has signs of activity like gas leaking, smoke or lava, or earthquake, then it Is considered active
 yah ve jwalamukhi hote hai jinke bare main vaigyanikon kii apeksha he ki ve fatenge nahin
 It is estimated that the lava and magma in them are gone and now there is no heat and material left to spew into them
 agar kisi jwalamukhi ke kabhi bhi visphotak prakaar kii sakriyata kii koi bhi ghatana hone kii smriti nahin ho to aksar use mrit samajha jaataa he
 It is difficult for scientists to distinguish between dead and dormant volcanoes, but if a volcano in human memory ever exploded long ago in history, it is considered dormant but not dead
 bahut se aise jwalamukhi hai jinhen fatne ke baad ek or visphot ke liye dabaav banane main lakhon saal guzar jate hai - inhen us dauraan supt mana jaataa he
 For example, the Toba volcano, which erupted nearly 70,000 years ago, killed all humans in the Indian subcontinent and the entire human race was on the verge of extinction, ready to re-erupt every 3,80,000 years
 is udgaar main lava ke saath adhik maatra main gas baahar nikalati he or lava kaa jamaav shanku kii tarah tathaa kabhi-kabhi gumbad yaa tile ke rup main hota he
 That is, those volcanoes whose cavity or mouth are not more than 100 feet in diameter and its shape is round or nearly round, and from which gas lava and fissile substances appear to be much higher in size with greater explosive emission
 Are called volcanoes with central origin
 ye atyadhik vinaashkari hote hai
 Eruptions cause severe earthquakes
 inhen visphot kii tivrata ke aadhaar par punah kai prakaaron main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he: In this type of eruption, the amount of gas with lava is small, which causes the lava to freeze on the ground through the crevices

 The hole in the middle of this mountain is called volcanic hole, mouth or hole
 yah chhidr neeche se ek nalee dwaara judaa rahata he jise jwalamukhi nalee kehete he
 In a recent research, it has been found that the pace of current climate change can be slowed by small volcanic eruptions

 It also presents ways to help in understanding these concepts and thereby gain spiritual realization
 Kabbalah is fully developed within the scope of original Jewish thought and constantly uses classical Jewish sources to explain and demonstrate its esoteric teachings
 These teachings are thus organized by kabbalists both to define meaning within Tanakh and to explain the importance of traditional Rabi literature, their pre-hidden apostolic dimension as well as Jewish religious observance palamira samrajya; angreji: Palmyrene Empire, isvi main syria ek samrajya tha jiske patan kaa karan roman samrajya bana tha

 He is the founder of GNU, besides he also created the Free Software Foundation
 dostollman ne jienyu compiler collection or GNU EMACS bhi viksit kiye hai
 Dr
 Stolman is considered the father of the GNU Public License
 1983 main, dow stollman ne jienyu pariyojna kii sruvaat kii thi
 The goal of the GNU project was to create a Unix-like operating system made entirely of open source
 isi ke saath unhone mukt software andolan kii bhi sruvaat kii
 Stollman has been a key producer and coordinator of the GNU project and has developed parts of the GNU software such as the GNU Compiler Collection, the GNU Debugger, and the GNU Emax Text Editor
 unhone 1985 main mukt software foundation kii sthapana kii thi
 From the mid-90s, Stallman spends most of his time advocating for free software and agitating against software patents, digital rights, and other technical legal systems that take away their freedom from users
 iname software license agreements, non disclozar agreement, acteveshan kees, donglls, copy restriction, proprietary formats or bina sorce code ke binary executables bhi shaamil hai
 It was Dr
 Stallman who put the idea of copyleft in front of the people, using the same principles of copyright, allowing the user to use the software, modify its source code, and distribute that software and its source code
 
 2012 tak inhe 14 anareri doctoret or professorships mili hai
 Stolman was born in 1953 in New York City
 stollman kii mata kaa naam elis lippman, vah peshey se skool shikshika thi, stollman ke pita danniel stollman printing press brokar the
 From childhood, Stallman was very interested in computers
 jab stollman ek pre - tin samar camp main the tab unhone IBM 7094 ke manuels padhe the
 Between 1967 and 1969, Stallman attended a Saturday program for Columbia University high school students
 1967 se 1969 ke bich stollman colombia uniwarsity ke hai skool students ke liye chalaaye jane vaale shanivaar ke program main jate the
 Stolman also served as a Voluntary Laboratory Assistant in the Biology Department at Rockefeller University
 unki ruchi ganit evam physics kii taraf zyaada thi lekin rockfilor uniwarsity main unke shikshak ke anusaar ve achche biologist bhi ban sakate the
 His first experience with computers was at IBM New York Scientific Center when he was in high school
 hai skool ke senior year ke baad unhen 1970 ke greeshm kaal ke liye liya gaya tha taaki vah Fortran language istemaal karke ek newmerical analysis kaa program likhe
 He finished the job in a few weeks, and the rest of the time he wrote a text editor program using the APL language and a preprocessor program using the PL / 1 programming language for which he used an IBM System / 360 machine
 harvard vishvavidhyalay ke first year main, stollman ko unke MATH55 main majboot pradarshan ke liye janaa jaataa tha
 By 1971, by the end of his first year, he had become a programmer at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
 ve haikar community main bhi jane jate the vahaan unhen RMS naam se janaa jaataa tha 
 In 1974, he graduated in Physics from Harvard
 apane grajuation ke baad stollman ne mitgrejueta student ke taur pe jwine join kiya
 He gave up his desire to do his doctorate in physics, after a year, he wanted to concentrate on programming in MIT AI LABORATORY
 1975 main ve MIT main gerri sussamen ke neeche research associat ke taur par kaam kar rahe the
 At that time Stollman published a research paper with Susman, this paper was on AI Truth Maintenance
 iskaa sheershak dependency directed backtracking tha
 This paper was an early work in intelligent backtracking in constraint satisfaction problems
 2003 tak stollman or sussamen dwaara die gaye takanic ko sabase shaktishaalee intelligent backtracking kaa tarika mana jaataa hai
 While working as a hacker at mit's AI Laboratory, Stollman worked on some software projects such as TECO, EMACS for ITS and LISP machine operating systems
 ve leboratory main computer ke simit uplabdhta ke kade aalochak the, us samay leboratory kii funding dephence advanced research project agency se hoti thi
 When mit's Laboratory for Computer Science installed the password control system in 1977, Stallman figured out a way to decrypt the password
 stollman ne sabhi yugeras ko mail bheja jisame unka dicript kiya hua password tha or is mail main unhone yugeras ko apana password badal kar nal string karne kaa suzav diya taaki computer system main phir se anonemas acces suru ho
 About 20% of the users followed him, but in the end the password system remained intact
 kai saal baad stollman ne apane is andolan ko safal bataaya
 At the end of the 70s and the beginning of the 80s, the hacker culture that Stallman lived in began to crumble
 software ko pratidwandiyon ke computaron par chalane se rokane ke liye companiyon ne sorce code dena band kar diya or copirite evam restrictive software licensos kaa istemaal karnaa suru kar diya taaki software ko copy yaa distribute karnaa simit yaa band kiya ja sake
 Such proprietary software existed before, and it was becoming clear that all software in the future would be proprietary software
 stollman ke MIT ke mitra brooster kahel ke anusaar software ke kanoonee charitra main yah badlaav US copirite act of 1976 ke kaaran hua tha
 When Brian Raid introduced software time bombs to control unlicensed access to the scribe markup language and word processing systems, Stallman rated it a "crime against humanity"
 kai varsho baad stollman ne yah safai di kii yujar ke swatantraaa ko rokane vaale karm ko ve aparaadh maanate hai, software ke liye paise lene ko nahin
 In 1980 Stallman and a few other hackers were not allowed to access the source code of the software for the new XEROX 9700 laser printer installed in AI Lab, with Stollman slightly changing the source code of its earlier laser printer
 is parivartan se yah hua tha kii printer driver printing job ke hone par log in kiye hue yujar ko yah massej bhejtaa tha kii "unka job ho chukaa hai " or agar printer main paper jam ho jaataa to yah software sab log in kiye hue yugeras ko isaki jaankaree dete ek massej bhejtaa tha
 It was not possible to add these features to this new printer, which caused a lot of problems for most of the users as the printer was on a different floor than most users
 is anubhav ke baad stollman nishchit ho gaye kii yugeras ko software main koi bhi parivartan karne kii azaadi honi chahie
 Richard Greenblatt was also a hacker in the AI lab and started Lisp Machines, Inc
 to sell Lisp machines
 yah Lisp mashine unhone or tom nite ne AI lab main dizine kiya tha
 Greenblatt had refused to seek external funding
 unka yah maananaa tha kii kuch mashin banaakar bechney se jo munafa hoga use company main phir se nivesh kar company ko or bada kiya ja sakegaa
 In contrast, other hackers thought that the venture capital approach would be better
 kisi agreement par naa pahuchane par vah havers jo venture fundad rasta lenaa chaahate the unhone saath main milakar Symbolics kii sruvaat kii ras noftskar kii madad se jo AI lab main administrator the
 Symbolics recruited all the other hackers, including well-known hacker Bill Gossaper, who left the AI lab
 cimbolics ne MIT ke policys kaa hawala dete hue greenblot ko istipha dene par majaboor kiya
 Both companies made proprietary software, with Stollman believing that LMI did not harm the lab community compared to Symbolics
 1982 se 1983 ke ant tak stollman cimbolics ke programmers ke output ko clon karne kaa kaam kiya karte the taaki cimbolics ko lab ke computaron par ekadhikaar karne se roka ja sake
 According to Stolman, software users should have the freedom to share software, along with that users should have the freedom to study and distribute the software's source code
 unke anusaar swatantraaa samaaj evam yugeras ke liye zaruri hai or yah ek naitik mulya hai
 Stallman quit his MIT job in February 1984 so that he could devote all his time to the GNU project, which he had scouted in September 1983
 sitambar 1983 main stollman ne GNU oparating system ke yojana kii ghosna kai ARPANET meling lists or USENET main kii thi
 Stollman had initiated the project himself, stating that "being an operating system developer i had the right skills for this task
 main yah maanakar to nahin chal saktaa tha kii is kaary main mujhe safalataa milegi, lekin mujhe aisa laga kii mujhe is kaam ke liye chunaa gaya tha
 i decided to make my system compatible with UNIX, so that it is portable and UNIX users can easily adopt it
 " In 1985 Stollman released the GNU Manifesto
 isamen unhone apane GNU naamak free oparating system banane kii ruparekha likhi thi
 It was supposed to be compatible with the GNU operating system UNIX
 yah naam GNU ek ricorsive echronim hai iskaa phul form "GNU is note UNIX" hai
 Soon after, he founded a non-profit organization called Free Software Foundation
 iskaa uddeshy software programmers niyukt karnaa tha or free software movement ko ek kanoonee rup se buniyadi dhaancha uplabdh karwaanaa tha
 Stollman is the chairman of the FSF without pay
 FSF ek 501 nonprofit sanstha hai masachusets main
 Stollman popularized the idea of copyleft
 copileft ek kanoonee kriyavidhi hai jo free software main badlaav or vitaran ke adhikaron ko niyantrit karti hai
 It was first implemented in the GNU Emacs General Public License
 1989 main pehla program mukt GNU general public license jari hua tha
 By then, a lot of the GNU system was ready
 stollman ne kai zaruri software tuls banaaye the, iname text editor ,compiler ,dibgar or ek bild automator shaamil hai
 The component that was left was the colonel
 1990 main GNU ke kuch memberon ne carnaji melone ke maa microkarnal ko GNU hard project main istemaal karnaa suru kiya, hard abhi bhi puri tarah se taiyaar nahin hai
 In 1991, Linus Trovalds created an open source monolithic Linux kernel with the help of gnu's development tools
 trowalds ne ne yah karnal free software license ke tahat release kar diya
 The GNU system and the Linux kernel were created together to create a new free operating system that we know as GNU / LINUX
 lekin aam chalan main GNU / LINUX ko linaks hi kaha jaataa hai
 It is unfair to call this operating system just Linux because it is the GNU system in which Linux kernels are used
 haikar culture main stollman ne POSIX naam or Emacs editor ko prabhavit kiya hai
 The popularity of Emacs in UNIX systems gave a tough competition to vi
 isse editor war suru ho gaya
 Stollman used to say that he considered himself st
ignucius of the Church of Emacs and said "vivivi is the editor of Satan" while "using the free version of vi is not penance"
 1992 main Lucid Inc jo apane khud kaa Emacs bana rahe the, unka stollman ke saath vivaad hua, aakhir main unhone apane software ko xemacs ke rup main fork kiya
 Stollman has written several essays on free software
 ve 1990 ke dasak se hi free software movement ke liye andolan karte rahe hai
 His given title is titled The GNU Project and Free Software Movement, Dangers of Software Patents and Copyright and Society in the Age of Computer Networks
 2006 or 2007 jab 18 mahino tak public kansalatesan chal rahaa tha GNU general public license varshan 3 ko draft karne ke liye, us samay unhone ek chauthaa shirsak jod diya jo prastaavit badlaavon ko vistaar se samajhaati thi
 Stallman's strong advocacy of free software inspired developers to create Virtual Richard m Stallman software
 yah software dibian GNU / LINUX system ke haal ke packages kaa vishleshan karata hai or un packejon ko report karata hai jo saath main non -free tree ban rahe ho
 Stollman does not agree with Debian's definition of free software
 1999 main stollman ne inacychlopedia banane kii baat kii thi jisame log articals banaaenge
 This led to gnupedia, which was later retired to Wikipedia, an emerging free online encyclopedia and Wikipedia was more successful
 stollman puri duniya main safar karte hai or ve free software or GNU project par bhasana dene kam se kam 65 deshon main gaye hai
 Stollman claims that there are many similarities between the Free Software movement and the movement of Mahatma Gandhi
 stollman ne kai baar GNU / LINUX naam ke liye vyavhaar karne kaa aagrah kiya hai us oparating system ke liye jo GNU system or linaks karnal ko saath main jod kar banaaya gaya hai
 Stollman considers this operating system a variant of GNU and tells GNU, the main developer of this operating system
 unke anusaar is software ko ko keval maatr linaks kehane se GNU project kaa darshan or is software ke bich kaa sampark tut jaataa hai
 From the beginning of 2003, they started using the name GNU + Linux so that no one could call it GNU / LINUX or GNU LINUX
 It may be that people mistakenly think that Linux kernels are maintained by GNU project
 stollman julian asanje or edward snowden jaise vishlablowers ke prashanshak hai
 Stolman has pleaded in his email signature after Snowden exposed the PRISM scandal
 yah mail kai meling lists main uplabdh hai
 : iskaa hindi anuwaad is prakaar hai
 Stollman spent much of his life in the political and software movement
 ve maanate hai ki dhan kii bahut kam parvaah karte hai
 Stallman says- "I have always lived in simplicity xxrep 4 
 like a student and i like it because don't do it like money tells me, don't do it"
 1998 tak MIT kaa AI lab jo unka offis tha unka ghar bhi hua karata tha
 He was registered to vote from there
 abhi ve cambridge main ek alag ghar main rahete hai jo MIT se zyaada dur nahin hai
 He does not get any salary for the post of his Research Affiliate in MIT
 1999 main unhone likhaa tha " ek naastik hone ke naate main kisi dharmik guru ko nahin maanata, lekin kabhi kabhi un main se kisi ke bole hue acchhee baat kii prashansa karata hoon"
 Stollman sometimes wears a button that reads "impeach god"
 jab stollman ko poocha gaya ke ve yahudee hai yaa nahin ? tab unka jawaab tha kii be naastik hai lekin yahudee mul ke
 Stollman does not consider Christmas, they celebrate "grav-mass" on 25 December
 yah naam or din sar isac newton par rakhi gayi hai, unka janam puraane calendar ke anusaar 25 disambar ko hua tha
 When asked who they were influenced by, the answer was Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi, Ralph Nadar and Dennis Kusiniyech and with it said - "I am Franklin D
 Rosswalt And I'm also a fan of Winston Churchill, though i criticize some of his work "
 stollman, green party ke samarthak hai or neshnal inishiative prapojal ke samarthak hai
 Stallman instructs not to keep a mobile phone because they believe that mobile phone tracking can cause harmful privacy problems

 France had to accept Germany's authority over the famous fortifications of Metz and Strasbourg

 The people of Paris revolted against Thiers and the House of Representatives, which led to the following: paris ke vidroh kaa kathorta se daman karne ke uparant thiurs ke saamne badi vikat paristhiti utpann hui
 Due to this rebellion, the condition of France became very disconcerting and till now there was an army present in France which was stationed on the part of Germany to obtain war supplies
 us sena ko teen arab rupaya dekar france se nikaala ja saktaa tha
 In such a situation it was not an easy task to get such a huge amount
 thiurs is bheeshan paristhiti se nahin ghabaraaya
 He started receiving money with great enthusiasm and courage

 The current government that was formed under Thiers's leadership was on the basis of republic, he was its president

 On the establishment of peace and order in the country, the imperialists wanted to try to establish the state
 thiurs prarambh main rajasattavadi tha, kintu rajasattavadiyon main itnaa adhik matbhed tha ki thiurs ko baadhya hokar apane vichaaron main parivartan karnaa padaa
 Now he became a supporter of the republic, due to which the royalists turned against him and he started an open movement to establish the state
 thiurs unke is kaary ko sahan nahin kar sakaa
 Therefore, he announced in December 1872 that if there was an attempt to establish a state power in France, there would be a re-revolution in France
 is ghoshnaa kaa spasht parinaam yah hua ki rajasattavadi uske viruddh ho gayi
 He could not get the support of the republicans either, because they considered him a person of very soft views

 After this a new constitution was made for France according to which ganatantr sarkaar ne apni sthiti ko sudrudh karne ke uparant desh kii unnati kii ore vishesh dhyaan diya or usne nimnlikhit sudhaar kiye- The question of the Church was very important before the republican government of France

 It was not only a religious question but also a political question
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki france kaa padri varg rajtantr kaa samarthak tha or ganatantr kaa virdohi tha
 All the movements that took place in support of the monarchy had a direct or indirect hand of the clergy
 is kaaran ganatantr ke samarthakon ne carch ke adhikaron par akraman karnaa aarambh kar diya
 It was only in 1877 that Gamebette made it clear that 'the clergy is a staunch opponent of the Republic
 ' is samay tak france kii samast shiksha par carch kaa adhikaar tha
 Most of the French people were in favor of freeing their children from this education

 At this time, the European political scene was dominated by German Chancellor Bismarck, who followed a policy that France could not have any friends in Europe
 france kii aupniveshik niti ke kaaran uske sambandh great-britain se achche nahin the or bismark ne anya mahatvapurn rajyon ke saath raajnneetik sandhiyaan kar rakhi thim
 By the time Bismarck held the German authority, he was successful in his policy

 The resignation of Bismarck led to the Treaty of France and Russia which became famous in history under the name of 'twilight Treaty'

 Accordingly, it was decided that both would help each other at the time of the attack

 England began to be apprehensive of the growing power of Germany and also felt that it was necessary to befriend a European power

 The functions and services of the bank can be divided into four categories: raashi jamaa karne main bank praaia: teen prakaar ke lekhe kholte hai : chal lekhe, sthir lekhe, bachat lekhe
 Bank deposits have to be paid at any time on the demand of the depositor
 at: ise bank kii 'maang dendaree' bhi kehete hai
 Fixed accounts are credited for a fixed period which cannot be withdrawn before the expiry of the period
 yadi koi jamakarta sthir lekhe main jamaa apni raashi ko avadhi purna hone se purv nikaalnaa chaahe to use raashi par byaaj nahin miltaa
 This type of deposit is called 'call liability'
 tisare prakaar kii jamaa bachat lekhe main kii jaati he
 No amount can be deposited beyond the limit prescribed in Savings Account is prakaar ke lekhe kam ywaale logon kii bachat ko protsaahan dene ke liye khole jate hai
 Sometimes special types of accounts are also opened for special works
 udaahranarth, vivaah ke liye dhanrashi sangrah ke hetu vivaah lekha, shiksha ke liye raashi sangrah karne ke hetu shiksha lekha aadi
 Loans and advances are given by the bank in several forms: bank apane graahakon or anya vishwasaneey vyaktiyon tathaa sansthaaon ko keval vyavsaay evam utpaadan sambandhi kaaryon ke liye rin dete hai
 While giving loan, banks open an article in the name of the borrower and deposit the loan amount in it, due to which the borrower keeps writing the amount from time to time by writing the check as per the requirement
 isse bank ko sakal rinrashi ek saath hi rinayachak ko de dene kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti jisase bank kaa hanibhay kam ho jaataa he
 Loans are sanctioned against personal credit and security of goods
 adhivikarsh dwaara rin dene se bank apane jamakarta ko uske chal tathaa bachat lekhon main jamaa raashi se adhik raashi nikaalane kaa adhikaar de detaa he
 But before obtaining such a right, the customer has to enter into a definite agreement with his bank on the amount of overdraft, its duration, rate of interest, etc
 bank vyavsaayik maal kii jamaanat par tathaa pranapatron or saakhapatron kii saakh par bhi rin dete hai
 Loans are given against the security of goods by keeping them in their godowns or by locking themselves in merchants' warehouses
 par is prakaar rin dene se pehle bank maal ke vaastavik mulya par chhot laga lete hai
 Loans can also be obtained from the bank through deduction of bills
 koi bhi malvikreta apane kharidaar ke naam vinimay bill likhakar usapar uski sweekruti praapt karke kisi bank se us sweekrut bill kii katautee kara letaa he
 On deducting, the bank deducts its commission and pays the balance of the bill to the bill holder and then at the end of the bill period, it gets the full amount from the acceptor of the bill
 is prakaar diya gaya rin praaia: alpakaaleen hota he
 The bank also performs agency work for its customers
 agency sambandhi kriyaayein is prakaar hai : graahakon ke liye bilon, chekon tathaa pranapatron kii raashi vasuul tathaa unki ore se chukaaye janevaale bilon, chekon tath pranapatron kaa bhugtan karnaa, kisi vyakti athwa sanstha ko niyamit rup se ek nishchit raashi bhugtana, beemaa companiyon ko pravyaji kii raashi chukaana, sarkaar kaa graahakon kii ore se iskar chukaana tathaa unki ore se malgujari chukaane kii vyavastha karnaa, company ke anshon par labhaansh tathaa rinpatron par byaaj vasuul karnaa or sarkari sicuritiyon kaa kray-vikray karnaa tathaa unke salaahkaar or pratinidhi kii haisiyat se kaam karnaa
 In banking practice, the relationship between bank and customer can often be expressed in three ways: jab bank main graahak kii raashi jamaa ho, jiskaa bhugtan bank ko graahak ke maangane par karnaa pade to bank graahak kaa dendar ore graahak bank kaa lender hota he
 But sometimes this relationship also turns the opposite
 jab graahak bank se rin le athwa apane lekhe main jamaa raashi se adhik raashi nikaale to bank graahak kaa lender or graahak uskaa dendar ban jaataa he
 In normal practice, the debtor is required to return the amount paid after the expiry of the loan, irrespective of whether the demand is from the creditor or not
 par bank ek aisa dendar hota he jo apane paas jamaa kii hui raashi ko graahak ke maangane par hi lautaata he, anyathaa nahin
 But if the customer is the debtor of the bank, then he has to pay the loan on the demand of the bank after the end of the period and not even after it is asked
 bank dwaara jamaa rup main liye hue rinon ke saath anya saamaanya rinon kii bhanti 'kaal maryaada niyam' lagu nahin hota
 The amount can remain in the customer's account for how long
 bank ek hi graahak ke vibhinn lekhon ko ekatra maanakar apana rin vasuul kar saktaa he par graahak bank main apane vibhinn lekhon ko ekatra maanakar raashi bhugtan karne ke liye bank ko vivash nahin kar saktaa
 The bank receives a title lien from the customer on the amount or securities in the normal transaction
 bank ko graahak kii un sicuritiyon par, raashi par tathaa vastuon par grahanadhikaar praapt hota he jo uske paas kisi vishisht uddeshy ke hetu na ai hon varan banking lenden ke saamaanya kram main praapt hui hon
 The bank can recover its loan if the customer does not repay the loan by selling the goods under the lien
 jis samay bank apane graahak ke aadesh se uske lekhe par sicuritiyon kaa kray vikray karata he, uske lekhe par iskar, bhoomikar, beemaa kii prakhyaji kaa, chanda aadi kii raashi kaa bhugtan karata he to us sthiti main bank graahak ke pratinidhi ke rup main kaam karata he
 As long as the customer's heritage remains with the bank, the bank is called the customer's trustee and the customer's bank's candidate
 pratyaashee ke rup main kaam karte hue bank ko apane pratyaashee ke dwaara jamaa kii hui vastuon ko badi saavdhaanee or suraksha ke saath rakhana aavashyak hota he
 Banks charge some fees from customers for this service
 bank mulat: saakh kaa lenden karte hai-saakh par janata se unki atirek bachat raashi jamaa lete or us jamaa raashi ko anya rinyaachakon ko rin rup main udhaar dete hai
 Thus, in the course of transaction of funds, banks create credit and are called creators of credit
 saakh kii srujankriya main jamaa, katautee tathaa nirgaman ye teen kaary sannihit hote hai
 When a bank approves a loan to a person or an institution, it usually does not provide the loan amount in cash at the same time, but opens and deposits the loan account of the person asking for the loan and the borrower is empowered to make the check as per his requirement
 Continue to withdraw money by writing
 is prakaar ek ore rin sweekrut kiya jaataa he to duusari ore usee rin kii raashi se jamaa bana lee jaati he
 Thus, debt gives rise to deposits
 jab bank apni jamaa raashi main se graahakon ko rin detaa he to us samay jamaa rin kii janmdatri hoti he or jab bank rin sweekrut karne main jamaa kaa nirmaan karte hai, to us samay rin jamaa ke janmdata ban jate hai
 The third method of credit creation is through banknote issuance
 par yah adhikaar keval desh ke kendriya bank ko hi mila hota he
 Each bank is independent in its credit creation policy, even if it has to keep its own credit-building capacity, the cash fund held by central banks, the fund of banks deposited with central banks, metallurgical funds deposited with banks, credit of credit petitioners and The general economic and political situation of the country has to be taken care of
 janata se dhan raashi jamaa karaane main bank do prakaar kaa daayitv apane upar letaa he- maang dendaree, kaal dendaree
 Demand dues are to be paid by the bank at any time on the statutory demand of the depositors and the term dues are usually paid at the end of the specified period
 aisi sthiti main bank apane paas jamaa kul raashi ko rin yaachakon ko udhaar nahin de saktaa kyonki use yah bhay rahata he ki na maaloom kab jamakarta maang karke apni raashi lene aa jaae
 Therefore, before lending, the bank keeps some cash in the fund with it, so that it can meet the demand of the depositors from time to time
 yah raashi bank kaa nakad kosh kehalaata he
 Some banks also keep cash funds with them and deposit them with the central bank so that they can meet the demand of the depositors by giving the amount from there
 nakad kosh bank kii saakh banaae rakhane main sahaayak hota he
 Cash fund is said to be the 'first line of defense' of the bank
 kisi bhi samay nakad kosh kii raashi nimna paristhitiyon par nirbhar hoti he : Statutory decisions, average deposits of depositors, banking habits and tendencies of the people, general nature of customers, local customs and circumstances, arrangement of Mundramandi business conditions or facilities of clearing house in the country
 ukt paristhitiyon ke atirikt nakad kosh kii maatra bank adhikariyon ke purv anubhav, unki doordarshita tathaa us desh kii vyapaarik sthiti par nirbhar hoti he
 The bank receives the interest it receives from the depositors by lending it to others
 is byaaj kii raashi main se kuch bhaag vah jamakartaon ko unki jamaa raashi par byaaj swaroop dekar shesh raashi vah apane paas bachaa letaa he
 The bank is required to carefully appropriate the remaining amount by keeping some part of its gross deposits as cash funds
 bank kii viniyog niti bhinn bhinn deshon main, bhinn bhinn avasaron par or vibhinn bainkon ke saath bhinn bhinn hoti he
 It is necessary for each bank to consider several factors while setting its investment policy
 bank kii raashi kaa viniyog is prakaar ho ki aavashyaktaa hone par use rokad raashi main badalawaaya ja sake, viniojit mooldhan surakshit rahe, viniogon se santoshjanak aay bhi mili, dhanrashi kaa viniyog kisi ek hi udyog vyapaar main na kiya jaae, bank kii raashi kisi vyaktivishesh ko hi rin ke rup main na di jaae, jamaanton kaa bhalee bhanti nirikshan kar liya jaae, jamaanat, jisapar raashi viniojit kii ja rahi he, taral, surakshit or laabhprad ho or yadi kabhi kisi jamaanat main mulya kaa hraas hone lage to rini se turant anya jamaanat lekar us hraas kaa puraa kiya ja sake
 Normally, banks appropriate their funds in two ways: by purchasing items like geodesy, furniture etc
 for conducting business
 isse bank ko koi aay nahin milti
 By giving short term loans, cutting bills and buying and selling securities
 inase bank ko aay hoti or laabh miltaa he
 To make a profit, banks appropriate their funds by giving short-term loans, purchasing and cutting bills, purchasing appropriations and other securities, or accepting loans and advances
 bank dwaara maanya jamaantein achal sampati se sambhddha athwa vaiyaktik ho sakati hai
 The collateral security may be in the form of a charter in respect of goods or goods in addition to the personal credit of the person taking the loan
 isamen saamanyat: teen adhikaar hote hai- swatv grahanadhikaar, praadhi or bandhak
 Under the lien, the bank reserves the right to retain the security held by the borrower if the borrower does not pay the loan
 bank ko is jamaanat ko bechney kaa adhikaar nahin hota or yadi vah aisa karnaa hi chaahe to use nyaayalay se tatsambandhi ajna praapt karnaa aavashyak hota he
 In the period, the ownership of the bail is transferred to the bank's name, but the debtor owns the property
 bandhak ke antargat bank ko jamaanat par grahanadhikaar karne or use uchit soochna dekar bechney kaa bhi adhikaar hota he
 The collateral security consists of commercial goods and merchandise rights, life insurance papers and securities sold on stock exchanges
 saamanyat: bank achal sampatti kii saakh par rin nahin dete
 Individual bail or guarantee can be of two types: for a specific amount, for an entire amount
 vishisht guarantee ke antargat guarantee karanevaala vyakti kisi vishisht evam nishchit raashi kii guarantee kar detaa he
 In addition to the total guarantee, the gross amount of the loan is guaranteed and its liability is for the gross amount
 guarantee likhit athwa maukhik di ja sakati he
 While taking the guarantee, it is necessary for the bank to thoroughly investigate the credit and financial condition of the person making the guarantee, so that there is no possibility of any loss in future
