chaynaatmak visheshxtacompany prayek khando main se alag alag khand kaa aakarshak or upyukt se chunata he is khand main company aakarshak or upyukt se graahakon ko apana lakshya banaata he yah ekam khand se thoda mahangaa hota he kyonki utpaadatak ko graahakon kii pasand ke bare main pataa nahin rahata he
 Full market cover
 This division has different segments for all the product as we can take example of Tata
 It is costlier than other strategies because the producer has to concentrate on all the segmentation
 utpaada visheshgautaais ranneeti main bazaar main bahut se khand hote he jo ek jaisaa hi utpaada bechate he isamen utpaadak ek hi tarah kii soch vichaar rakhane vaale graahakon ko apana lakshya banaata he
 It is cheaper than full market
 bazaar visheshgautaais ranneeti ke upyog sirf vishesh khando main hi graahakon ko lakshya kiya jaataa he isamen utpaadak apane utpaadan ko madhya najar rakhte hue graahakon ko lakshya karata he isamen graahakon kii maango ko nahin balki utpaadan ko najar main rakhte he
 Bin discrimination is targeted
 In its view, the market is a group without any segmentation, so this strategy can be used only by producers with little or no competition for their business
 lakshayikaran kendrityah drushtikon vishesh bazaar aalaa ko chayan karne main kendrit karata he jahaan vipanan prayaso ko bhi lakshith kiya jaataa he aapaki company ek kshetra yaa khand ko samajhane main dhyaan detaa he to utpaadak sirf usee kshetra kii maangen or zarurato ko jaanane main zyada dhyaan de saktaa he
 Multisectoral Targeting This target strategy is used when targeting two or more well-defined divided markets and also helps in the development of different strategies for that segmented market
 mahangachotti companyyaan lakshith vipanan par bahut saare rupee kharch karte he ve aksar praathmik anusaandhan karte he taaki unhen pataa chal sake ki unke utpaada ko koun kharidta he vipanan anusaandhan prabandhak anusaandhan agency ko kiraye par le sakati he taaki wo phone surveykshan kaa sanchaalan kar sake jo lakho ke kharcho kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 TIME TAKES TIME TO IDENTIFY THE CONSUMERED RESEARCH Analyze data and create advertisements to reach them
 Many small companies use the method of market segmentation process to give them the target customer profile that is derived from demographic details
 nazarandaajajab utpaadak apane utpaada ke bazaar ko graahakon kii maango or jaruraton ke hisaab se vibhajit karte he to wo sirf unhi graahakon ko lakshya karata jo uske utpaada kii maang rakhata or baaki ke graahakon ko wo nazarandaaj kar detaa he
 Idea small companies or maybe only less educated people can make their target who are poor but more in the population, they make them their target because they see the strategies of the people who meet their market department, so also the pact
 In low income Ilaco keep their hand so that they can become the cause of this disease in those Illaco
 sthiti nirdhaaran bazaar vibhaajan or lakshya nirdhaaran ke baad aata he, jab utpaadak ko maaloom ho jaataa he ki uski vastuon kii maang kitni or koun karata he? to wo apni vastuon ko usee bazaar main sthit karata he arthath maango or vibhajit ke anusaar sthit kiye jane vaale vastuon yaa utpaada kii prakriya ko sthiti nirdhaaran kehete he
 Attribute positioning or the message that the producer wants to convey to the customer, the message should contain some characteristics of the object or some characteristics of the message object should be clarified
 udhaaharan:dav shampoo iske vigyaapan main utpaadak kahata he ki uske utpaada main ek chauthai nami jo baalo ko mulaayam or reshmi rakhe yah sandesh graahakon ko vah utpaada kharidne ke liye badhaava detaa hai
 Profit status: When the producer advertises for his product, then there is and should be something about the benefit of that product in that advertisement
 udhaaharan:complan iske vigyaapan main iske laabh ke bare main kehete he kii iske seven se aapaki unchai badhegi is vigyaapan ko dekhakar jis kisi kii bhi unchai kam ho wo ise jarur kharidta he

 udhaaharan:fevicol badhi yaa sutaar lakdi jodne ke liye isi kaa zyada upyog karte he kyonki unka maananaa he ki wo utpaada is kaam ke liye sabase acha he
 User status claims to be in the group of users as a good product
 udhaaharan:lekami,agar koi upbhokton kaa samooh lekami kaa utpaada istemaal karata he to wo is utpaada ko acha maanenge or aisi vasteen aise samooh ke graahakon main hi sthit kiya janaa chahie taaki unka utpaada jaldi bik sake
 Competitive situation: The product is better in the customer perspective than other competitors or how competitive the product may be, but the demand for this product will remain the same, that is, no matter how new and good products come in the market, the consumer will not get that old product Would like to buy only
 udahaaran:nokia,pehle log sirf nokia ke phone kharidte the chaahe bazaar main doosraa nayaa phone hi kyon naa aa jaae logon kaa maananaa tha ki yah phone hi sabase acha he
 Product Category Status: Product claims to be the best in a category
 udahaaran: soni jo electronics utpaada main acha mana jaataa haior graahak bhi sabase pehle use hi khareednaa pasand karte he
 Quality and price claim to be good value according to the situation, that is, the price that the customer gives, he gets that type of quality finished product
 udhaaharan: volvo jo keemat zyada jarur letaa he par us badale wo vaisaa mulyavan utpaada detaa he
 The Greek alphabet is a twenty four letter system using which the Greek language is being written since the eighth century BC
 prayek swar evam vyanjan liye pruthak chinh vaali yah pehali evam pracheenatam varnmaala he
 This alphabet originated from the Phoenician alphabet and many of Europe's alphabets originate from it

 After the second century BCE, mathematicians also started using Greek letters to represent numbers
 unani varnon kaa prayog vigyaan ke kai kshetron main kiya jaataa he, jaise bhautikee main tatwon ke naam, sitaron ke naam, birdari evam saathi sampradaay ke naam, ooshna katibandheey chakravaaton ke naam ke liye
 The emergence of the Greek alphabet centuries after the fall of the Mycenaean civilization and after the disuse of the earlier Greek writing system, the Linear b script, in the eighth century BC
 Happened in the middle of rekhiy bi kaa udbhav rekhiy e se hua jo ki minoai sabhyataa dwaara viksit thi, jinaki bhashaa unani se sambandhit nahin thi, parinamswaroop minoai aksharmala unani bhashaa kii dhvaniyon ke lipyantaran hetu adarsh madhyam uplabdh nahin karaatin
 The Greek alphabet prevailing today developed after the Greek dark period, that is, the decline of the Mycenaean civilization and the rise of ancient Greece, which was about 800 BC
 It was the time between the epics of Homer and the beginning of the ancient Olympic Games in 776 BC

 Vowel signs were not originally used in the Semitic alphabet
 purvavarti pashchimi simitic lipi parivaar main, ek avishisht swar ke saath vyanjan hetu ek akshar hameshaa prayukt kiya gaya
 This did not reduce readability as the word in semitic languages is based on triaxial roots that explain meaning only by the presence of consonants and vowels are clarified by context
 vipareet, unani ek bhaaropee bhashaa he atah swar main antar arth main bada antar paidaa karata he
 Therefore, the Greek alphabet divided the letters into two categories - vowels and consonants, where a consonant must be used with a vowel to become an accentable unit

 In Eastern Greek, which lacked complete pronunciation, the semitic glottal consonant / ħ / ka h) was also used for long vowels / ɛː / and finally Ω) The letter began to be used for long / ɔː / 
 The reason for the inclusion of long open letters e and o lies in oral morphological study of the language
 paramparaagat greek main nishchayatmak evam sambhaavnarthak aksharon main spasht bhed tha jo ki ‘ε ) vs

 In other vowels, there is no need for graphic difference between long and heart

 Greek also included three new consonant letters Φ), Χ) and Ψ) which are given at the end of the alphabet according to their development
 ye vyanjan dhvanyatmak aksharon main tulana yogya uccharanon ke abhaav main bane the
 In Western Greek, x was used for / ks / and ψ was used for / kh / - so the Latin letter x is derived from the Western Greek alphabet

 The Greek script underwent parallel changes to the Latin alphabet during the medieval period: while the old forms remained as memorized scripts, the one-inch and ultimately shorter forms became dominant
 At the end of the word, similar to the Latin long and heart s, σ was written similarly ς

 These adopted names had no meaning in Greek except for the address of letters
 However, some of the signs added or added later by the Greeks actually had names and meanings

 namakan prakriya : Majlis Zamindar was born in 1782 in the Gurjar family in village Luharli near Dadri Gautam Budh Nagar
 inkaa puraa naam majalis bhaati tha i ve umrao singh gurjar ke krantikari saathi the Imajalisa jameendaar 1857 kii kranti me ek vir krantikari the 
 And participated in the 1857 revolution with Raja Umrao Singh
 jiske kaaran unhen ring leader act main angrejo ke dwaara bulandashahar kaale aam par faansee par lataka diya gaya tha 
 Along with him, 84 other revolutionaries were also hanged
 majalis jameendaar luhaarli ke bete kaa naam nathua singh bhaati tha 
 Nathua Singh Bhati's son's name was Bhikki Singh Bhati
 ve ek krantikari the or kai baar unhe aazaadee ke liye jail bhi janaa padaa tha 
 He also went to Tihar Jail several times
 bhikki singh bhaati ko 15 agast 1972 me us samay kii pradhanmantri indira gandhi ji ke dwaara tamra patr diya gaya tha 
 And three pensions which were available for the Salt Movement, Azad Hind Fauj, and Satyagraha
 bhikki singh ke teen bete the 
 Mahavir Singh, Randhir Singh, and Sarvajit Singh
 11 sitambar 1803 main angrejo ne dilli par kabja kar liya tha 
 But by 1857, due to the policy of plundering the plunder of the British and their Pitthuos, the prosperous lakhori bricks of all the areas of Bhatner were reduced to four walls
 ek taraf anaaj godamo main padaa sadta tha to duusari taraf anaaj anndaata kahalaane vaale kisaan ke phus ke ghar main bagaiyr anaaj ke chakki par dhul jam jaati 
 The peasant laborer felt that after getting the carrot radish, sweet potato potato greens, etc
, he got the support of life
 haalanki kisaan puri mehnat or lagan se apane kheton main kaam ko anjaam dete the 
 But when it comes time to pick the grain and bring it home
 tabhi lagaan vasuulne aa jate angrejon ke pisthuo ke karinde 
 Whatever grain was left from them, Sud Khor Mahajan would have taken them
 kisaan yaa to fasal pakane se pehle kachche anaaj ke hole karke thodaa bahut kha letaa yaa phir jo anaaj bhuse ke gathe main chupa rah jaataa use hi ghar le aata 
 His bread was also made for several days
 vah bhi ek -ek do - do roti hisson main baant milti baaki sang se pet bharna hota yaa jab koi mehmaan aa jaataa or uske liye roti banati tab uske khaane ke baad bachi rotio ko tukade karke ghar ke baccho ko di jaati 
 For some reason there was no rain and the crop dried up, the crop was ruined or the flood was swept away, then the poor farmer had to fall
 lagaan vasuulne vaale jameendaar ke lathait or mahajan ke lathait bhens or bail khol kar le jate or laathiyaan bechaare par labhaav main padati 
 For this reason the common Indian peasant laborer was more unhappy than the British government and his agents Zamindar and Sud Khor Mahajans
 yahi vajah thi ki jab meerut se kaali palaton main baghawat bhadkee to aam dehati janata khaskar gurjar log bhi shaamil ho gaye 
 At that time, the slogan of independence Jindabad was not invented
 in logon ke bas yahi naare the 
 Overthrow the English government, kill the agents of the government, demolish their kothi bungalow
 jin bahi khaaton main hamaare purvaj tak girvee rakhen pade hai or unke karj kaa sood pidiyon baad taq vasula jaataa he 
 Burn them, it was the anger that these rural laborers brought the peasants up to the jungling jungles of the landlords of the moneylenders
 bhala phoos ke kachche gharon main rahane waalon ke liye kis kaam kii thi ye tamaam chijen lutaa bhi to kya lutaa ? in chizon ko gaav tak laana muft main boj hi maranaa tha 
 One thing worth noting in this war of 1857 is that he was a government official and zamindar at that time
 lekin ek bhi gurjar aisa najar nahin aata jo is aag main na kuuda ho 
 While people of other communities were some here and there
 yahi khami thi ki yah kranti naakaam ho gai 
 Otherwise, many states could be evacuated from the British in such enthusiasm and passion
 jo sahukaar rajavaade yaa east india company ke liye aisi hangaami halaat main apni tijoriyon ke munh khol diya karte the unamem deshbhakti kaa jajba nahin jagaa tha or ek ne bhi krantikariyon kii madad nahin kii thi 
 The names of many Gurjar zamindars who were involved in the war of the revolution of 1857 are present, but here we are referring to the Gurjar Zamidar Majlis ji of Luharli village, who were also among the same kind-hearted zamindars who used to collect rent from farmers
 alaava iske kisaan ke halaat dekhakar us par riyaayat bhi kar diya karte the 
 The Majlis landlords were involved in the war of revolution from day one, but in the mahapanchayat of Til Begampur, when Rao Umrao Singh was chosen as the King of Revolutionary War i
e
 Dadri Bhatner, the Majlis landlord also overthrew the British government
 Swore and formed a jelly army involving young revolutionaries around him was a weapon for revolutionaries and also because it was the same Eye and had come too Jidharr Jelly forces left

 It would have done the same thing given by Rao Umrao's committee
 jelly sena main 18 57 kii kranti kii jang main nihaayat hi ahm role anjaam diya tha
 The revolutionaries were rescued by attacking Bulandshahr's prison
 angreji sarkaar ko pangu bana dena sarkari agent kii kothi or haveliyo ko tabah or barbaad karnaa
 Did gtal from Bulandshahr to Ghaziabad pass the British, that even the British runners would pass through the terror of the jelly army from Secunderabad to Sahukar, from Secunderabad where they were hidden there

 On May 10, the 1857 mass revolution was started from Meerut by Kotwal Dhan Singh Gurjar, whose ladder Dadri had reached Secunderabad and Bulandshahr
 12 may 1857 ko jisame umrao singh gurjar ke saath majalis zamidaar va unke 84 saathiyo ne sikandarabad tehsil par dhaava bol diya tha iora khazaane ko apane kabze me le liya tha jisase angrezi shashan bhadak chukaa tha isaki soochna milte hi city magistrate va sena sikanderabad aa pahuchi i saat din tak krantikari sena angrezi sena se takkar leti rahi i On 19 May 1857, the gallant revolutionary army had to lay down arms in front of the English army and 46 gallant revolutionaries were arrested and arrested
 is krantikari sena me gurjar samaaj ke ahm yogadan ke liye unhe british satta ke coup kaa bhazan bananaa padaa iora gurjar samaaj ke logo ko chun chunakar bandi banaaya jane laga i On 21 May 1857, Umrao Gurjar reached Bulandshahr with his team and attacked the district prison and rescued all his revolutionary companions
 bulandshahr se angrezi shashan samaapt hone ke asaar lagane lage lekin angrezi sena aa jane ke kaaran aisa nahi ho paaya i On 31 1857, a historic war took place on the banks of Hindon River in Ghaziabad district
 jisame mirza mughal rajanihaal singh or validad khan ke saath aasapaas ke gaav vaale bhi apane hathiyaaro ke saath is yuddh me sammillit hue i After heavy losses, the revolutionary army surrendered

 It is the second largest sect of Islam after the Sunni sect, which constitutes only 15% of the entire Muslim population
 san 632 main hazrat mohammad kii mrityu ke pashchaat jin logon ne apni bhaavana se hazarat ali ko apana imam or calipha chunaa wo log shiyane ali kehalaae jo aaj shiya kehalaate hai
 But from Sunot, Sunni do not call them "shia" or "shiyane Ali" but "rafazi"
 is dharmik vichaardhaara ke anusaar hazarat ali, jo mohammad sahab ke chachere bhai or damaad donon the, hi hazrat mohammad sahab ke asli uttaradhikari the or unhen hi pehla caliph bananaa chahie tha
 However this did not happen and he was made Khalifa, ie the head leader, after three more people
 ali or unke baad unke vanshajon ko islam kaa pramukh bananaa chahie tha, aisa vishvas rakhane vaale shiya hai
 Sunni Muslims believe that the first four Caliphs, including Hazrat Ali, were Satapathis, while Shia Muslims believe that the first three Caliphs were non-legitimate heads of Islam and that they start counting the Imams from Hazrat Ali and that the use of the word Khalifa in this count do not do
 sunni muslim ali ko caliph bhi maanate he or unke putr hossain ko maravane vaale caliph yajid ko kai jagahon par pathbhrasht muslim kehete hai
 The majority of the followers of this sect live mainly in Iran, Iraq, Bahrain and Azerbaijan
 iske alaava syria, kuwait, turki, afghanistan, pakistan, oman, yaman tathaa bharat main bhi shiya aabaadi ek pramukh alpsankhyak ke rup main he
 There are three subdivisions of the faith of Shia Islam - Barhwari, Ismaili and Zaidi
 ek mashhoor haddees mankunto maula fa ha ja ali un maula, jo mohammad sahab ne gadir naamak jagah par apane aakhri haj par khutba diya tha, main spasht kah diya tha ki musalmaan samudaay ko samudaay ali ke kahe kaa anusaran karnaa he
 In 632, Muhammad Sahab addressed his companions near Khumm Sarovar in his last hajj
 shiya vishwaas ke anusaar is kitaab main unhone apane damaad ali ko apana vaaris banaaya tha
 Sunnis consider this incident to be praise for Ali and believe that he did not appoint Hazrat Ali as caliph
 isi baat ko lekar dono pakshon main matbhed shuru hota he
 After the Hajj, Muhammad Sahib began to remain ill
 unhone sabhi bade sahaabiyon ko bula kar kaha ki mujhe kalam daavaat de do ki main tumko esa navishta likh don ki tum bhatko nahin to umr ne kaha ki ye hijayaan kah rahe he or nahin dene diya 
 According to Shia history, even when news of Prophet's death was received, he did not come back and started gathering in Sakifa, what should be done now
 jis samay hazarat mohammad kii mrityu hui, ali or unke kuch or mitra mohammad sahab ko dafanaane main lage the, abu baqar madina main jaakar kilaafat ke liye vimarsh kar rahe the
 Many people of Medina agreed to make Abu Bakr a caliph
 shiya manyataon ke anusaar mohammad sahib evam ali ke kabeeley vaale yani bani hashim ali ko hi khalipha bananaa chaahate the
 But there was no solidarity among the Muslims to inherit the largest empire of Islam ever
 kai logon ke anusaar ali, jo mohammad sahab ke chachere bhai the or damaad bhi hi mohammad sahab ke asli vaaris the
 But Abu Bakr was first made Khalifa and after his death Umar was made Khalifa
 isse ali ke samarthak logon main or bhi rosh failaa parantu ali musalamaanon kii bhalaai ke liye chup rahe
 Usman became the third Khalifa after Omar
 parantu inke samay main shiya rafazi baagiyon logon ne misr tathaa iraq va anya sthano se aakar madina main aakar osman ke ghar ko gher liya 40 din tak osman ke ghar ko gheraav kiya ant main osman ko shahid kar daalaa
 When Osman bin Afan was martyred, he was 79 years old, he was stabbed repeatedly in the head, his wife came to save him, he cut his finger, the tigress came to his house from the back side, in the front
 Hussain Ibne Ali and Hasan Ibne Ali, both sons of Hazrat Ali, were guarding! ab phir se calipha kaa pad khaali tha or islamic samrajya bada ho rahaa tha
 No one saw Muslims other than Hazrat Ali, but Ali did not believe in becoming a Khalifa
 kai din shura ke log khalipha ke pad ko na bhar sake
 Finally, when Ali was forced, you said that Ilahi Nizam would work in my Khilafat
 unhen chauthaa khaliph niyukt kiya gaya
 Ali was famous for his justice, when Ali became the Khalifa, the demand of the former Khalifa Usman's revenge and punishment for him started arising, but seeing the situation of the Muslims and Muslims, Ali did not take any action but the people did not When Raas came, he used an army to punish the killers of Osman
 ali ne kaha osman ke katilo ko sajaa zarur milegi, par inka udyeshy kuch or tha to jamal naamak jang hui
 Sometime later, Mu'awiya, the Subedar of Syria, also opposed Ali
 muavia tisare khaliph osman kaa rishtedaar tha or usee osman ke katilo ke sajaa kii maang se sifphine main jang hui jisamen muavia bhi haar gaya
 In 661, Imam Ali was deceitfully martyred in a mosque in Kufa
 iske baad muavia ne apane ko islam kaa caliph ghoshit kar diya
 Proponents of Hazrat Ali and theoretically Muhammad sa Sahib's relatives showed allegiance to his son Hasan, but some left him
 hasan ibne ali ne jang na kii balki maviya ke saath sandhi kar lee
 Actually, in the time of Ali, in the battle of Siffin, Mavia wanted to become Khalifa
 wo syria kaa governor pichle khalifaaon ke kaaran bane the ab wo apni ek badi sena taiyaar kar rahe the ab usne vahi sawaal imam hasan ke saamne rakhaa: yaa to yuddh yaa phir adheenta
 Imam Hasan did not accept subjugation but he did not want to shed the blood of the Muslims, so he stayed away from the war
 ab maavia bhi kisi bhi tarah satta chaahate the to imam hasan se sandhi karne par majaboor ho gaye
 Imam Hassan handed over power to him only on his terms

 redcliff rekha 17 agast 1947 ko bharat vibhaajan ke baad bharat or pakistan ke bich seemaa ban gai
 The line was demarcated by the Boundary Commission headed by Sir Cyril Radcliffe, who was authorized to fairly divide 175,000 square miles of territory among 88 million people

 Similarly, Bengal was divided into East Bengal and West Bengal
 azaadi ke baad, uttar-pashchim seemaant praant ne janamat sangrah ke zarie pakistan main shaamil hone kaa chayan kiya
 The distribution of the population of Punjab was such that there was no such line which could be neatly divided into Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs
 Similarly, no line could satisfy the Muslim League under Jinnah, and the Indian National Congress under the leadership of Nehru and Patel as well as the British
 Furthermore, "partitioning of road and rail communications, irrigation schemes, power systems and tillage areas" was inevitable for any division

 As it happened "in the entire subcontinent, some 140 million people left their homes and by all means possible - via air, rail and roads, in cars and lorries, buses and bullock carts, but mostly on foot - As people set out to seek shelter "
 Many of them were killed by opponents, some died of hunger or fatigue, while others were affected by "dysentery, cholera and all other diseases that afflict malnourished refugees everywhere"
 The death toll is estimated to be between 200,000 and 20 million, with a consensus about a million casualties

 In June 1947, Britain appointed Sir Cyril Radcliffe to chair two border commissions - one for Bengal and one for Punjab - to determine precisely which states to allocate to which country
 ayog ko nirdesh die gaye ki "musalamaanon or gair musalamaanon ke bahumat vaale samipsth kshetron kii jaanch ke aadhaar par, punjab ke do hisson kii simaaon kii hadabandi karen

 Each commission had four representatives - 2 from the Indian National Congress and 2 from the Muslim League
 Given the deadlock between the interests of the two sides and their hostile relationship, the final decision was essentially Radcliffe's
 8 july ko bharat main pahunchane ke baad, redcliff ko seemaa ke bare main faisalaa karne ke liye sirf 5 saptaah die gaye
 Soon he met his college alumnus Mountbatten and traveled to Lahore and Calcutta to meet the members of the commission, especially Nehru from the Congress, and Jinnah, president of the Muslim League
 He objected to the scheduled short time, but the request of all parties was to draw the line with the British withdrawal from India on 15 August
 Mountbatten accepted the post of Viceroy on the condition of an early deadline
 vaapasi se thik kuch din pehle hi nirnay sampann hua, lekin raajnneetik chalbaasiyon ke kaaran, bharat or pakistan ko azaadi manzur karne ke do din baad, yani 17 agast tak ise prakashit nahin kiya gaya
 a businessman, Radcliffe and other commissioners had all the glitter but lacked the knowledge required for this particular task

 " "bahari pratibhaagiyon — udhaaharan ke liye, sanyukt raashtra — kii anupasthiti ne bhi british sarkaar dwaara laaj bachaane kii apni tatpar ichha ko santusht kiya ki use apane hi samrajya main—shashan chalaane—yaa shashan samaapt karne ke liye bahya madad chahie
" The equal representation given to the leaders of the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League seemed to provide balance, rather than create a deadlock
 rishte itane vivaadaaspad ho gaye the ki nyaayadhish "mushkil se ek duusare kii baat ko sahan kar pate the" or kaarysoochiyon main itnaa antar tha ki charchaa kaa koi matlab nahin rah jaataa

 The Punjab Border Commission was to draw a line from the middle of the regional home of the Sikh community
 lord isle british ke prati udhaas the ki samudaay kaa adhik lihaaj na kiya gaya, jo unke shabdon main pratham vishwa yuddh ke dauraan samrajya kii seva main "bhartiya sena main kai hazaar shandaar rangaruton ko bhartee kiya tha
 "however, the Sikhs were fierce in their opposition to any solution that would place their community in a Muslim-ruled state
 In addition, many urged their own sovereign state, which no one agreed to
 sabase ant main, aise samudaay the jinka koi pratinidhitiv nahin tha
 Representatives of the Bengal Border Commission were mainly concerned about who would get Calcutta
 There was no official representation of the Buddhist tribes of the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bengal and they had no information to contend with their position until two days after Partition
 paristhiti ko duhsadhay or atyaavashyak maanate hue, redcliff ne sabhi mushkil nirnay swayan liye
 yah shuruuaat se hi asambhav tha, lekin lagata he redcliff ko khud par koi andeh nahin tha or halaaton ko badalane ke liye koi aadhikarik shikaayat yaa prastaav nahin uthaaya
 Prior to his appointment, Radcliffe had never visited India and did not know anyone there
 british or jhagadne vaale rajanetaaon ke liye, yah kami faaydemand nazar ai; britain ke atirikt, unhen kisi bhi dal ke prati nishpaksh mana gaya
 Only his personal secretary, Christopher Beaumont, was familiar with the administration and life of Punjab
 nishpakshta ke pradarshan ko banaae rakhane ke liye, redcliff ne vysarai mountbeton se bhi apni duuri banaae rakhi
 No amount of knowledge could succeed in creating a line that would avoid collision; Already, "communal riots in Punjab and Bengal faded the British's hopes of a quick and dignified return"
 "the seeds of many postcolonial disorders of South Asia were sown long before, in two centuries of direct and indirect British rule, but, as every book has demonstrated, no part of the complex tragedy of Partition was inevitable
 " If the Commission had been more careful, massive mistakes in partition could have been avoided
 udhaaharan ke liye, aisi kai ghatnaayen hai jahaan seemaa-rekha is prakaar khinchi gai ki gaanv kaa kuch bhaag bharat main or kuch bhaag pakistan main rah gaya
 Since Radcliffe had only a month's time, he ignored the due diligence of the village boundaries
 unki seemaa ghani aabaadi vaale do pradeshon ke bich se jane ke bajaay, thik unke bichon bich se hokar guzari
 aise kai udhaaharan hai jahaan vibhaajan-rekha ek ghar ke bich se guzari jiske kuch kamare ek desh main or duusare anya desh main rah gaye
 Radcliffe justified such careless division with the stereotype that even if they did anything, people would have to suffer
 The thinking behind this justification will never be revealed because Radcliffe "destroyed all the papers before he left India"
 He left on Independence Day itself, before the border awards were distributed
 In his own confession, Radcliffe was particularly impressed by his lack of health and an eagerness to leave India for the Indian climate
 karyanvayan seemaa-rekha khinchne kii prakriya se kuch kam tej nahin thi
 Indian and Pakistani representatives were given two hours to study the copies on August 16, 1947 at 5:00 pm on August 17, before the Radcliffe Award was published
 vivaadon or deree se bachane ke liye vibhaajan gupt rup se kiya gaya tha
 The final awards were ready on 9 August and 12 August, but were not published until two days after the split
 read ke anusaar, kuch paristhitijanya saboot maujuud hai ki nehru or patel ko punjab adhinirnay kii vishaywastu ke bare main agast 9 yaa 10 ko, sambhawatah mountbeton ke madhyam se yaa redcliff ke bhartiya sahaayak sachiv ke zarie gopneey rup se jaankaree di gai thi
 Regardless of how this happened, the award was changed to put the main eastern part of the Sutlej Canal under India's jurisdiction rather than Pakistan
 is kshetra main paanch lakh kii sanyukt jansankhya ke saath do muslim bahul tahseelein thim
 There were two obvious reasons for this change: the area had an army arms depot and it had a river head of a canal irrigating Bikaner, a princely state in the part of India
 isi tarah, yah gyaat nahin he ki kaise redcliff ko chatgaanv pahari ilaaqon ko pakistan ko saunpane ke liye raji kiya gaya
 This was a shock to Patel and Nehru who believed that these areas would be handed over to India as 98% of the people who settled there were non-muslims
 isi tarah, bengal main muslim bahul jile murshidaabad or malda ke nirnay ko bhi gupt rakhaa gaya jahaan ke nivaasiyon ne 17 agast 1947 ko adhinirnay ke saarvajanik prakaashan tak pakistan kaa jhanda fahraaya
 The truth of how these decisions were taken will never be known, because Radcliffe destroyed all records and Mountbatten categorically denied any specific information or favoritism
 vibhaajan ke baad bharat or pakistan kii nai naveli sarkaron par seemaa lagu karne kii sari jimmedaari chhod di gai
 After visiting Lahore in August, Viceroy Mountbatten quickly arranged for the Punjab Border Force to maintain peace around Lahore, but not enough to stop the killing of thousands, of which 77% were rural Were from the area
 kshetra ke aakaar ko dekhte hue, 1 se kam prati varg mile sainik bal kaa hisaab baithta tha
 This was not enough to protect the cities, and the same holds true for the caravan of tens of thousands of refugees leaving their homes in territories known as Pakistan

 Ultimately, border conflicts led to three wars in 1947, 1965 and 1971, as well as dual nuclear weapons tests in May 1998 and the 1999 Kargil conflict
 redcliff rekha ke sambandh main do pramukh vivaad maujuud the, chatgaanv pahari ilaake or gurdaspur jila

 Chittagong Hill areas had a majority non-muslim population of up to 97%, but it was handed over to Pakistan
 chatgaanv hill trects piples association ne bengal seemaa ayog ke samaksh yachika daayar kii, kyonki chatgaanv main adhikash gair musalmaan based the, ve bharat main rahanaa chaahate the
 kyonki unka kisi ne aadhikarik pratinidhitiv nahin kiya tha, is maamle par koi aadhikarik charchaa nahin hui or bharat kii ore kai logon kaa maananaa tha ki CHT bharat ko saunp diya jayega
 On 15 August 1947, many tribes did not know which side of the border they belonged to
 17 agast ko redcliff adhinirnay ke prakaashan ke baad CHT ko pakistan main daal diya gaya
 The logic of putting Chittagong Hill Tracts on the part of Pakistan was that they were inaccessible to India and did so to provide Chittagong with some anti-amphibious areas, major cities and ports; It was also argued that the only access was through Chittagong
 "do din baad, CHTPA ne adhinirnay kaa paalan na karne kaa sankalp kiya or bhartiya jhanda fahraaya gaya
 The Pakistani army dealt with this protest but the problem has not been resolved yet
 " Gurdaspur district was given to India, except for the sub-division of Shakargarh
 gurdaspur jile main aitihaasik islamic shahar devband, barelvi or ahmadiya samudaay ke saanskrithik centre shaamil the
 There was a slight majority of Muslims in Gurdaspur district as the Ahmadiyya community was counted as Muslims, even though Muslim clerics declared them non-muslims; a large number of Ahmadiyas had gathered in this area as their religious center was in Qadi Gurdaspur district
 jile main samagratah musalmaan or gair musalamaanon kaa anupaat kramshah 50
6 or 49
4 tha; shakargarh or gurdaspur prayek tehsil main 51% bahumat tha; batala tehsil main 53% bahumat tha; pathankot tehsil main 67% gair musalamaanon kaa bahumat tha
 In the end, only the Shakargarh tehsil was handed over to Pakistan, leaving a minor majority of non-muslims in the rest of the district
 yah anumaan lagaaya gaya ki use lord mountbeton ke aagrah par saunpa gaya tha, taaki agar kashmir rajya ke shaasha bhartiya sangh main ekikrut karne kaa faisalaa lete hai, to vah bharat ke liye sameep sulabh ho jayega
 maamla chaahe jo bhi ho, pathankot tehsil bharat ko chalaa jaataa or vah purvi punjab ke hoshiyarpur or kangra jilon ke aas-paas ke ilaaqon ke saath sidhe rail maarg se judaa hua tha
 Another point was that Batala and Gurdaspur would provide deterrence for the Sikh holy city of Amritsar, which would otherwise have been surrounded by the Muslim territory of Pakistan
 The last point was presented by Mountbatten and others as a plea to the Border Commission that if the eastern region of the Ravi river is treated as a stretch, which covers most of Amritsar and Gurdaspur districts, it would be non-existent
 Muslims will be a majority in the minority
 Furthermore, by doing so, the majority of the Sikh population will come to the East Punjab part; While doing the opposite, a slight majority will be left in Pakistan and this will increase the number of Sikh refugees
 This was an attempt to pacify the Sikhs, as they had lost several major areas in western Punjab
 badale main redcliff dwaara pakistan ko firozpur or zeera tahseelon ko saunpane kaa prayaas kiya gaya tha
 This was opposed by the Maharaja of Bikaner as the Harike river at the confluence of the Sutlej and Beas was located at Ferozepur from where a canal originated, which was the only source of water for their desert state
 unhone jab mountbeton ko dhamkee di ki ve apana rajya pakistan ko saunp denge yadi firozpur pashchim punjab ko diya gaya, to uske baad hi antim kshan main adhinirnay badal diya gaya or puraa firozpur bharat ke saunp diya gaya
 Another contentious decision in the decisions made by Radcliffe was the division of Malda district in Bengal
 jile main samagratah maamuli muslim bahumat tha, lekin ise vibhajit kiya gaya or malda shahar sahit, iskaa adhikansh hissaa bharat ko mila
 15 agast 1947 ke baad jila 3-4 dinon ke liye purvi pakistan prashasan ke tahat bana rahaa
 yah keval jab adhinirnay ko saarvajanik taur par prakat kiya gaya tab malda main pakistani jhande ko hataa kar bhartiya dhvaj fahraaya gaya
 The entire Khulna district, with a moderate Hindu majority of 52%, was given to East Pakistan in exchange for the much smaller Murshidabad district, with a 70% Muslim majority coming to India
 janamat sangrah ke anusaar assam kaa silahat jila pakistan main shaamil ho gaya

 rutusanhaar mahakavi kalidas kii pratham kavyrachana maani jaati he, jiske chah sargo main greeshm se aarambh kar vasant tak kii chah rituon kaa sundar prakrutichitran prastut kiya gaya he
 The art form of Rituskharana is not as lofty as other works of the great poet, due to which it is suspected to be Kalidasa's work

 Based on the short story of Arjuna's war with Kiratveshi Shiva described in the Mahabharata, the poet has given a captivating description of politics, religion, diplomacy, socialism, war, politics and life

 There are six famous epics of Sanskrit - Brihattrayi and Minatrayi
 kiratarjanuyium, shishupalavdham or naishadhicharitam – brihattrayee kehalaate hai
 Kumarasambhavam, Raghuvansham and Meghdootam - are called miniatures
 kiratarjunium bharavi kii ekmaatr uplabdh kriti he, jisane ek sangopang mahakavy kaa maarg prashast kiya

 There have been at least 37 commentaries of Kiratarajuniyam in Sanskrit, of which the Mallinath commentary is the best

 raajnneeti or vyavhaar-niti main bharavi ke vishesh rujhaan ke chalate yah yuktiyukt hi tha ki ve kiratarjunium kaa kathanak mahabharat se uthaate
 He raised the small theme of acquiring Pashupatastra as a result of Shiva's abject penance by Arjuna for the unfolding of the Pandavas during the exile of the Pandavas from the five chapters of Vanaparva and gave it the form of this epic of eighteen cantos
 jab yudhisthir kauravon ke saath sampann dyutakrida main sab kuch haar gayi to unhen apane bhaaiyon evam draupadi ke saath 13 varsh ke vanvaas par janaa padaa
 Most of his time was spent in dualism
 vanvaas ke kashton se khinn hokar or kauravon dwaara kii gayi sajeesh ko yaad karke draupadi yudhisthir ko aksar prerit karti thim ki ve yuddh kii taiyaari karen or yuddh ke madhyam se kauravon se apana rajpth waapas len
 Bhima also favors Draupadi's talk
 guptchar ke rup main hastinapur bheje gaye ek vanechar se soochna milti he ki duryodhana apane sammilit rajya ke sarvangin vikaas or sudrudhikaran main dattachitt he, kyonki kapat-dyut se hastgat kiye gaye aadhe rajya ke liye use pandavon se ashanka he
 The Pandavas also feel that at the end of the period of exile, half of their kingdom will not be returned without war
 draupadi or bhim yudhisthir ko vanvaas kii avadhi samaapt hone kii pratiksha na kar duryodhana par turant akraman ke liye uksaate hai, lekin adarshavaadi, kshamashil yudhisthir vyavhaar kii maryaada laanghane ko taiyaar nahin
 Vyas, who has come there, advises that the Pandavas should advance their power for future war
 unheen ke dwaara bataae gaye upaay ke anusaar arjuna shastrastra ke liye indra ko tap se prasann karne ke liye ek yaksha ke maargdarshan main himalay-sthit indrakil parvat kii ore chal padate hai
 Indra is present in the guise of an old sage after taking the test by sending apsaras etc
 as a result of austerities done by building an ashram there and illustrating the importance of charitableness, stating the perishable cosmic goal of austerity
 arjuna isaki kaat main kauravon dwaara kiye gaye chal evam anyaay kaa lekha-jokha prastutkar shatru se pratishodh lene kii anivaaryta, saamaajik kartavya-paalan tathaa anyaay ke pratikaar kaa tark dekar indra ko santusht kar dete hai
 As a result, Indra, appearing in his real form, advises Arjuna to do penance for Shiva for mano-fulfillment
 arjuna phir se ghor, niraahaar tapasya main leen ho jate hai
 Arjuna is a stranger to Indrakil, ascetic, jata, Valkal and mrigacharm, but he also has armor in the body, in place of Yajnopavit, there is a Gandhiv bow with a pratchancha, two huge tarakas and a perfect pillar
 use munidharm-virdohi samajhakar vahaan ke anya tapasvi aatankit hai or shankar ke paas nivedan ke liye pahunch jate hai
 In his order, Shiva, disguised as the commander of the local tribal tribe, arrives to Arjuna with the army of his ganas
 tabhi 'mook' naam kaa ek daanav arjuna kii tapasya ko devataaon kaa kaary samajhakar, vishaal shookar kaa sharir dharankar, usko maarane ke liye jhapatata he
 a similar arrow fired simultaneously by both Shiva and Arjuna ends that pig's illusion
 shiv kaa baan to uske sharir ko bedhta hua dharti main dhans jaataa he or arjuna jab apana baan uske sharir se nikaalane jate hai to shiv apane ek gana ko bhejkar vivaad khadaa kara dete hai
 As a result, a war between the two begins
 arjuna ganon kii sena ko to baan-varsha se bhaagane ko majaboor kar dete hai par shiv ke saath hue yuddh main parrast ho jate hai
 Desperate from defeat, Arjuna recognizes Shiva and surrenders, disguised as Kirat-senapati, leading Shiva to appear happy and impart Pashupatastra to him
 is tarah arjuna kaa mantavya puraa hone ke saath mahakavy-vidha ke bhi saare mantavya siddh ho jate hai
 Apart from this extraterrestrial myth of the Kiratha prostitute Shiva, this episode also has its own specific tribal expression, which brings this poetry closer to the current sentiment
 yudhisthir or guptchar bane vanechar ke bich ghatit samvaad main vanechar kii jo atoot swamibhakti, adamya nirbhikta or ucch raajnneetik samaj saamne aati he, vah vanavaasiyon ke prati bharavi kii pakshabharata main andeh kii koi gunjaaish nahin chhodti
 Vancher makes it clear in the beginning- is puure prakaran ke armbh main draupadi kii baton ke samarthan main bhim dwaara yudhisthir ke prati kuchek nitiwachan kahe gayi hai
 One of them is cited below: bharavi apane arth-gaurav ke liye jane jate hai—‘upama kalidassy bharverrthgauravam’
 His wealth is an ingenious language and expressive skills matching this sense of pride
 raajnneeti or vyavhaar-niti sahit jivan ke vividh ayaamon main unki asaadhaaran paith he
 The balance earned by the duality of ideals and attitudes and the excesses of excesses of real life makes his writing 'all-rounder'
 lekin bharavi mulat: jivan kii vidambnaaon or visangatiyon ke kavi hai, unka saamana karte hai or unke khurdure yatharth ke bich sangati bithaane kaa prayaas karte hai
 In the first canto of Kiratarajuniyam, in order for Draupadi and Bhima in the second to provoke Yudhishthira to declare war against Duryodhana, and Yudhishthira rejecting him as unjust, Bharvi provided a very meaningful discussion on the duality between the two ends of politics
 is
 isi tarah gyarahawein sarg main moksh ke sthaan par shakti or prabhutaa ke liye kiye ja rahe arjuna ke tap ko indra dwaara garhit bataae jane par, arjuna ke pratyuttar ke rup main bharavi ne jivan-vyavhaar main anyaay ke pratikaar, loukik safalataa, yash or aatm-sammaan ke mahatv par jo gambheer vichaar die hai ve swasth ihlokik jivan kaa ek santulit adarsh kaa chitra upasthit karte hai
 The linguistic miracle of chitrakavya, which Bhartvi started, owing to his unwavering authority over the language, became the criterion for his later poets and reached the climax in Magh

 In the first canto of Kiratarajuniyam, in order for Draupadi and Bhima in the second to provoke Yudhishthira to declare war against Duryodhana, and Yudhishthira rejecting him as unjust, Bharvi provided a very meaningful discussion on the duality between the two ends of politics
 is
 tisare sarg main vyas kaurav paksh ke bhishma, dron, karn-jaise dhurandharon ko pandavon dwaara ajey bataate hue 13 saal kii avadhi main har tarah se shakti-sanvardhan karne or bhavishya ke avashyambhavi yuddh kii taiyaari ke liye uskaa upyog karne kii salaah dete hai
 For this they inspire Arjuna to please Indra with austerity for high-quality weapons and also leave a Yaksha brought with him which will take Arjuna to a place suitable for Indra's penance
 chauthe sarg main yaksha ke maargdarshan main arjuna kii dwaitvan se himalay tak kii yatra kaa sajiv evam rochak varnan he, jisamen sharad ritu kii thir or sanyat prakruti or uske saath ghule-mili jan-jivan kaa ullas naanaa roopon main tarangit he
 From the journey of Arjuna with the fifth canto Yaksha, Giriraj is enlightened by the vivid, ornamental description of the mountainous region of the Himalayas
 chathe sarg kaa varnya vishay he : arjuna kii aankhon se dekhi indranil kii apratim shobhaa, vahaan pahunchakar arjuna dwaara tap kaa prarambh, prakruti ke vibhinn upaadaanon kaa tap main sahyog, vahaan tainaat vanadevon dwaara amravati pahahunchakar indra ko suchit karnaa, indra dwaara devanganaon ko unke sahchar gandharvon ke saath vahaan jaakar apane haav-bhav or soundarya se arjuna kii tapasya main vighn daalane kaa aadesh dena, taaki unki nishtha kii pariksha ho sake
 In the seventh canto, the Apsaras and their companions Gandharva travel from Amaravati to Indrakil along the banks of the Ganges with special elephants and chariots riding the sky
 indrakil ke paas neeche utarkar ve prithvi-ganga ke ramya tat par apni maaya se gandharva-nagari jaisaa divya shivi bana lete hai
 In the eighth canto, the apsaras leave their camps for forest-hunting
 yahan se shringaar ras kaa rang chadhana shuru hota he, jo isi sarg main varnit jal-krida main gadha hota he or nawein sarg main madh-paan ke saath sampann kaam-keli main apni paraakaashtha par pahunch jaataa he
 The tenth canto is the campaign and failure of Apsaras to grab Arjuna's attention and meditate on him
 gyarahawein sarg main vayovruddh muni ke vesh main indra ke aagaman or unke dwaara tapasya ke sansaarik lakshya kii nissartaa kaa nidarshan he jiske pratyuttar main arjuna loukik jivan ke mulyon, praathamiktaaon kaa apana aakhyaan rachate hai
 At the end of this canto, satisfied with Arjuna's reasoning, Devaraja appears in his form and teaches the worship of Shiva according to his goal
 barahawein sarg main arjuna ghor tapasya armbh kar dete hai jisase ghabaraakar anya sanyasi shankar ke paas ja pahunchate hai
 Shankar meets Arjun disguised as Kirat
 terahaven sarg main arjuna or kiraat rupadhari shiv donon sookar rupadhari par tir se akraman karte hai
 The last five cantos of Kiratarajuniyam are dedicated to the war between Kirataveedhari Shiva and Arjuna with their Ganesha
