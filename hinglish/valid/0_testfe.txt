 But not with superfluity, it is the root cause of the problem rather than the inadequate physical exercise and excessive consumption of carbohydrates and not the product itself
 Many dietetics books have cited beer as having a very high sugar index similar to maltose 110; However, maltose undergoes a process of metabolism by the yeast during fermentation so that most of the water content in the beer, including hop oils and only maltose of the added sugars, remains

 shrimati trini visteern su vibhakta mahapatha
 1-5-7 7
 shriimatii = glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa = with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii = great, city; dasha cha dve = ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani = yojana-s; aayataa = lengthy; triini vistiirnaa = three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles

 In physical cosmology, astronomy and astronomical mechanics, dark energy is an imaginary form of energy that pervades the entire space and has a tendency to increase the rate of expansion of the universe
 gupt urja haal ke un paryvekshanon evam prayogon ko vyakt karne kaa sarvaadhik lokapriy tarika he jiske anusaar brahmand kaa vistaar ek twaransheel dar se hota hua maaloom padataa he
 In the standard model of cosmology, dark energy is currently considered to be 74% of the total energy-mass of the universe
 gupt urja ke do prastaavit rup brahmand sambandhi niyatank, jo antariksh ko samroop se krambaddh karne vaali urja ghanatv kaa sthiraank he or adish kshetra jaise ki saar tatv yaa moduli, jo gatisheel rashiyaan hai jinka urja ghanatv samay evam sthaan main bhinn ho saktaa he
 The contributions of scalar fields that remain constant in space are usually included in cosmological constants
 brahmand sambandhi sthiraank bhautik rup se nirvaat urja ke samakaksh hota he
 Scalar fields that change in space can be difficult to distinguish from cosmological constants because the change can be very slow
 samay ke saath vistaar kii dar main parivartan ko samajhane ke liye brahmad ke vistaar ke ucch-yatharthata maapan ko samajhnaa jaruri he
 In general relativity, the expansion rate is developed to conform to the criterion by the cosmological state equation
 gupt urja kii avasthaa ke sameekaran kaa moolyankan karnaa aaj maapne aaj paryvekshan sambandhi brahmand vigyaan ke sabase bade prayaason main se ek prayaas he
 Adding cosmological constants to the standard FLRW meter system of cosmology produces a LAMDA-CDM model, which has been called the "model standard" of cosmology due to its exact match with observations
 haal ke ek prayaas main gupt urja kaa prayog brahmad ke liye ek chakree model kaa nirmaan karne ke liye ek mahatvapurn ghatak ke rup main kiya gaya he
 In 1998, the supernova cosmology project began in 1999 following the published observations of Type La Supernova by the high-z Supernova research team which suggested that the universe is expanding at an accelerated pace
 tab se, in prekshanon kii pushti kai swatantra sroton se hui he
 Background measurements of cosmic microwaves, gravitational lencing, and the broader structure of the universe, as well as advanced measurements of supernovae, have remained consistent with the lambda-cdm model
 supernova brahmand vigyaan ke liye upyogi hai kyonki ve sampurna brahmad sambandhi duriyon main utkrisht maanak batti hai
 They allow us to measure the expansion history of the universe by looking at the relationship between distance from an object and its displacement towards its long wavelength, which shows how fast it is retreating from us
 habal ke niyam ke anusaar, sambandh mote taur par raikhik hota he
 It is relatively easy to measure displacement toward long wavelengths, but it is more difficult to find the distance from an object
 aamtaur par, khagolvid maanak battiyon: vasteen jinke liye aantarik chamak, nirpeksh pariman, gyaat hota he, kaa upyog karte hai
 It allows the distance of an object to be measured by its actual observed brightness, or apparent magnitude
 tip laa supernova apane charam, evam atyadhik sangat, chamak ke kaaran brahmand sambandhi sampurna duriyon main sarvottam-gyaat maanak batti hai
 Recent observations of supernovae correspond to a universe made up of a mixture of 71
3% dark energy and 27
4% dark matter and baryon-related matter
 gupt urja kaa astitv, chaahe jis rup main ho, antariksh kii maapit jyamiti kaa brahmad ke kul padaarthon ke saath milan ke liye aavashyak he
 More recently, a measurement of the cosmic microwave background in physics with properties different from the direction of measurement by WMAP spacecraft) suggests that the universe is nearly flattened
 brahmad kaa aakaar chapata hone ke liye, brahmad kaa dravyaman / urja ghanatv kuch kranthik ghanatv ke samaan hona chahie
 The total magnitude of matter in the universe, measured by the CMB, is only about 30% of the critical density
 iskaa taatpary shesh 70% ke liye urja ke ek atirikt rup kaa hona he
 The most recent WMAP observations correspond to a universe composed of 74% dark energy, 22% dark matter and 4% ordinary matter
 biihat sanrachana kaa siddhant, jo brahmad main sanrachana ke nirmaan ko nirdhaarit karata he, yah bhi suzav detaa he ki brahmad main padaarth kaa ghanatv kranthik ghanatv kaa keval 30% he
 When photons pass through accelerated cosmic expansions, they generate flattened gravitational potential wells and hills, causing cold spots and hot spots in the CMB aligned with giant supervoids and superclusters

 The nature of this dark energy is a matter of contemplation

 Since it is not very dense — roughly 10–29 grams per cubic centimeter — it is hard to imagine it to be detected in the laboratory
 sirf gupt urja kaa brahmand par itnaa gaharaa prabhaav padataa he, jo brahmad ke ghanatv kaa 74% hota he, kyonki yah anyathaa rikt sthaan ko bharta he
 The two major models are the sky and cosmic constants
 donon modelon main aam visheshta shaamil hai ki gupt urja main rinatmak dawaab hona chahie
 The latent energy would require a negative pressure independent of its true nature to express the acceleration observed in the expansion rate of the universe
 saamaanya saapekshata ke anusaar, ek padaarth ke bheetar daab apane dravyaman ghanatv ke saamaan hi anya vastuon ke liye apane gurutveey aakarshan main yogadan detaa he
 This happens because the physical quantity that causes a substance to produce a gravitational effect is the stress-energy tensor, which is the energy density of a substance and its pressure and thickness

 Actually negative pressure does not affect the gravitational interaction between masses - which remains attractive - but instead it alters the overall evolution of the universe on a cosmological scale, resulting in masses generally present in the universe
 The acceleration of the universe expands despite the attraction between
 gupt urja kii sabase saral vyakhya yah he ki yah maatr "antariksh hone kii laagat" he: arthath, antariksh ke ek pariman main kuch aantarik, moulik urja he
 It is a cosmological constant, sometimes called lamda, after the Greek letter Λ, a symbol that is used to express this sign in mathematical form
 chunki urja or dravyaman e = mc 2 se sambandhit hai, oinstin kaa saamaanya saapekshata kaa siddhant yah bhavishyavaanee karata he ki iskaa ek gurutvkarshan sambandhi prabhaav hoga
 It is sometimes called a vacuum energy because it is the energy density of an empty vacuum

 This is related to the Casimir effect, in which there is a small stretch in regions where real particles are geometrically prevented from developing

 However, particle physics predicts a natural value of 1 in reduced Planck units, a large anomaly that has not yet been understood
 brahmand sambandhi sthiraank main rinatmak dawaab uske urja ghanatv ke baraabar hota he evam isliye brahmad ke vistaar ko teji se badhaata he
 The negative pressure of the constants of the universe can be understood by conventional thermodynamics; To work in the vessel, energy must be wasted from within the vessel
 aaytan dv main parivartan ke liye kiye gaye kaary ko urja main parivartan −p dv ke baraabar hona chahie, jahaan p daab he
 But in fact the amount of energy in the vacuum energy box increases as the volume increases, because the energy is equal to ρv, where ρ is the energy density of the cosmological constant
 isliye, p rinatmak he evam, vastav main, p = −ρ 
 a major problem is that most quantum field theories predict a huge cosmological constant from the energy of a quantum vacuum, of which more than 100 magnitude orders are extremely large
 ise lagbhag radd karne kii aavashyaktaa hogi, lekin vipareet pratik vaale ek vishaal pad dwaara samaan rup se bilkul nahin
 Some supersymmetric theories require a cosmological constant that is actually zero, which is not helpful

 The inclusion of cosmological constants in the standard model poses another problem: that is, the manifestation of solutions with isolation regions of low-density materials
 Asatya also affects the pre-emblem of the pressure assigned to the cosmological constant, which is changed to become attractive by the current negative pressure, when one looks back toward the former universe
 maanak model main brahmad sambandhi sthiraank ko shaamil karne vaale supernova aankade kaa ek vyavasthit, model se swatantra moolyankan yah sanket detaa he ki in aankadon main vyavasthit truti hai
 Supernova figures are not an inescapable evidence for the expansion of a rapidly expanding universe that may be just a spread

 a recent theoretical investigation revealed the cosmological time, date, deviation for a finite interval, ds, related to the observer reaching the cosmological horizon, expressing the physical limit of the observance
 khagoleey prekshanon, vishesh rup se gupt urja kii prakruti se sambandhit, kii sampurna vyakhya ke liye aavashyak yah ek pramukh ghatak he
 The identification of latent energy as a cosmological constant does not appear to be consistent with the data

 Despite its problems, the cosmological constant is in many respects the most economical solution to the problem of cosmic acceleration

 Abstracts differ from cosmological energy in the sense that it can vary in location and time
 ise guchchhedaar evam sanrachana sadrush padaarth nahin banane dene ke liye, kshetra bahut halkaa hona chahie jisase ki iskaa ek vishaal compton tarangadairghy ho
 So far no evidence of the abstract is available, but it has not been ruled out either
 aam taur par yah brahmand sambandhi sthiraank kii tulana main yah brahmad ke vistaar main thode dhime gati vardhan kaa purvanumaan karata he
 Some scientists believe that the best evidence of the abstract will come from violations of Einstein's equivalence principle and the variation of the fundamental constant in space and time
 The scalar field is predicted by standard models and string theory, but a problem akin to the cosmological constant problem arises: the theory of re-normalization predicts that scalar fields must take large masses
 brahmadia sanyog kii samasya yah prashn karata he ki brahmadia twaran kyon shuru hua
 If cosmic acceleration started earlier in the universe, then galaxy-like structures would not have got time to arise and life, at least as much as we know it, would not have got time to exist
 Proponents of human life theory find it helpful to support their argument
 haalanki, saar tatv ke kai modelon main ek tathakthith khoji vyavhaar hota he, jo is samasya kaa hal karata he
 In these models, there is a density in the essence region that closely searches for radiation density until the matter-radiation similarity occurs, which causes the element to behave like dark energy and ultimately dominate the universe

 In 2004, when scientists made the development of dark energy with cosmological data appropriate, they found that the state equation probably crossed the limit of cosmological constants from top to bottom

 Different universe will have different values of vacuum energy and in many or most it will actually be huge
 But it should be small in ours because only in such a universe can we develop observers like us

 It has been argued that compatibility for opposite solutions at times of general relativity requires such a double metric, and that both dark matter and dark energy can be understood in terms of opposite solutions at times of general relativity
 brahmad vigyaniyon kaa anumaan he ki mote taur par twaran 5 arab varsh pehle shuru hua
 Prior to that, it is thought that the expansion was slowing down due to the attractive effect of dark matter and baryons

 In particular, when the volume of the universe doubles, the density of dark matter is halved but the density of dark energy is almost unchanged

 Under this scenario, dark energy would eventually blow up all of the gravitationally bound structures, including galaxies and solar systems, and control the electrical and nuclear forces to blow off the atoms themselves, ultimately leading to the universe's There will be a "big piece"
 On the other hand, latent energy can spread over time, or can also be attractive
 aisi anischitataayen is sambhaavna paidaa karti hai ki gurutvakarshan kaa abhi bhi aadhipaty ho saktaa he or yah ek aisa brahmad taiyaar kar saktaa he jo swayan ko ek "bade charmarhat" main sankuchit kar le

 While these ideas cannot be supported by observations, they cannot be ruled out

 The cosmological constant was first proposed by Einstein as a process of obtaining a permanent solution to the gravitational field equation in which a static universe is created, effectively using latent energy to balance gravity

 The equilibrium is unstable: if the universe expands slowly, the expansion leaves vacuum energy, which produces more expansion

 This transformation is named after the French mathematician Adrien Mari Lajandra

 It can be easily shown that if g is the divergent transformation of f, then the divergence of f, g will be udhaaharan ke liye, falan f = x 2 2 { \ displaystyle f={ \ tfrac {x^{2}}{2}}} tathaa falan g = − p 2 2 { \ displaystyle g=-{ \ tfrac {p^{2}}{2}}} ek duusare ke lajaandra roopaantar hai
 In a particular case, if the function f is a convex function, then its relative transformation ƒ * can be expressed by the following relation- Let f = cx2 defined on R, where c > 0 is a fixed constant
 For x * fixed, the function x * x - f = x * x - cx2 of mold: Mvar has the first derivative x * - 2cx and second derivative −2c; there is one stationary point at x = x * / 2c, which is always a maximum
 Thus, i * = r and Clearly, namely f ** = f
 Let f = x2 for x ∈ i = 
 For x * fixed, x * x - f is continuous on the template: Mvar compact, hence it always takes a finite maximum on it; It follows that i * = R
 The stationary point at x = x * / 2 is in the domain if and only if 4 ≤ x * ≤ 6, otherwise the maximum is taken either at x = 2, or x = 3
 It follows that The function f = cx is convex, for every saanchaa:mvar 
 Clearly x*x − f = x is never bounded from above as a function of saanchaa:mvar, unless x* − c = 0
 Hence f* is defined on I* = {c} and f* = 0
 One may check involutivity: of course x * x - f * is always bounded as a function of x * ∈ {c}, hence i ** = R
 Then, for all mold: Mvar one has and hence f ** = cx = f
 Let be defined on x = Rn, where saanchaa:mvar is a real, positive definite matrix
 Then saanchaa:mvar is convex, and has gradient p - 2ax and Hessian −2A, which is negative; hence the stationary point x = a − 1p / 2 is a maximum

 Previously, computers used relays, delay line memory, or a variety of vacuum tube arrangements to implement "main" memory functions, some with random access and some not
 Coils constructed from vacuum tube triodes and later from discrete transistors were used for relatively small and fast memory such as random-access register banks and registers
 ekikrut rome paripathon ke vikaas se pehle, sthaayee yadrichhik-abhigam memory kaa nirmaan aksar adress visanketakon dwaara sanchalit ardhchaalak diod metrison kaa prayog karke kiya jaataa tha
 Modern types of writeable rams typically store a bit of data either in a flip-flop state such as an aceram, or as a charge in a capacitor such as a DIRAM, EPROM, EEPROM, and Flash
 kuch prakaaron main samta bit yaa truti sudhaar code kaa prayog karke sangrahit data main memory truti kahalaane vaale yadrichhik dosha kaa pataa lagane ke liye or / yaa unhen sudhaarney ke liye circuitary hoti he
 Instead of storing read-only types of RAM, ROM, charge, uses a metal mask to permanently activate / deactivate selected transistors
 chunki esaram or diram donon hi asthir hote hai isliye computer bhandaaran ke anya roopon jaise discs or chumbakeey tepe kaa prayog paaramparik computaron main sthaayee bhandaaran ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Many new products rely instead on flash memory for the maintenance of data when they are not used, such as pdas or small music players
 Some personal computers, such as many fast computers and netbooks, have also replaced magnetic disks with flash drives
 flash memory ke saath, sidhe code nishpaadan kii anumati pradaan karte hue keval nor prakaar yatharth yadrichhik abhigam main sakasham he or isliye aksar rome ke bajaay iskaa prayog kiya jaataa he; kam laagat vaale nand prakaar kaa prayog aam taur par memory cardon or thos-avasthaa vaale drivon main thok bhandaaran ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Like a microprocessor, a memory chip is an integrated circuit composed of millions of transistors and capacitors)
 computer memory ke sabase saamaanya rup, gatisheel yadrichhik abhigam memory ) main memory cell kaa nirmaan karne ke liye ek transister or ek sandharitra ko joda jaataa he jo keval ek bit data ko darshata he
 The capacitor contains a bit of information - a 0 or a 1
 The transistor acts like a switch that allows the control circuitry of the memory chip to read the capacitor or change its state
 kai computer tantron main ek memory padanukram hota he jisamen sipiu register, on-daai esaram druthika, bahya druthika, diram, prishthan pranali or ek hard drive kii abhaasi memory yaa gamagam sthaan shaamil hote hai
 This overall pool of memory may be referred to by many developers as "RAM", even RAM in different subsystems may have completely different access times, violating the basic concept beyond the random access noun
 ek padanukram str jaise diram ke antargat bhi vishesh pankti, kollam, bank, rank, channel, yaa ghatakon ke antavpatrit sanghathan abhigam samay ko parivartaneey bana dete hai haalanki is had tak nahin ki aavarti bhandaaran madhyam yaa tepe parivartaneey ho jaae

 As suggested above, low-volume RAM) is integrated into hard-drives, cd-roms, and many other parts of the computer system, as well as cpus and other ics on the motherboard
 yadi koi computer teevr anuprayog chakra ke dauraan ram par dhimaa ho jaataa he to kai sipiu architekchar or oparating tantra, ek kaary nishpaadan main sakasham ho jate hai jise "gamagaman" ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Swapping uses a paging file that is an area of a hard drive used temporarily as additional working memory
 is kriyavidhi ke nirantar upyog ko thraishing kehete hai or aam taur par yah avaanchhneeya hoti he kyonki yah tantra ke sakal kaary-nishpaadan ko dhimaa kar detii he jiskaa mukhya kaaran yahi he ki ram kii tulana main hard drive adhik dhime hote hai
 Other physical devices that have read-write capability may use "RAM": for example, DVD-RAM
 An indexing method is also named "random access": that's why disk storage is often called "random Access is called " # File and Input / Output, Platform, Standard Edition # Random Access]], indexed file) because the read end can speed up from one part of data to another relatively quickly
 And does not need to read all of the above data
 haalanki, antim "M" mahatvapurn he: "ram" main hota he) hameshaa thos-avasthaa vaale upkaran ko sanderbhit karata he
 RAM is often a shorthand or short text of an online conversation in reference to the computer's main working memory
 software, kisi computer kii ram ke ek hisse kaa "vibhaajan" kar saktaa he or ise ek adhik tej hard drive ke rup main kaary karne kii anumati pradaan karata he jise ram discs kehete hai
 If the memory used is not non-volatile, the data stored in the RAM disk is lost when the computer is turned off
 haalanki, volatile memory apane data ko yathaavat rakh sakati he jab computer band ho jaataa he yadi iske paas ek alag shakti-strot, aam taur par ek bydaree ho
 Sometimes, ROM contents are copied to either ASRAM or DIRAM to achieve a relatively short access time
 The ROM chip is then deactivated when initialized memory locations are changed and installed in the same block of address
 commuter or ambeded pranali donon main is prakriya kaa aam taur par prayog kiya jaataa he jise kabhi-kabhi shadowing bhi kehete hai
 As a general example, typical personal computer bios often have an option called "use shadow bios" or a similar option
 sakriy kiye jane par bios ke rome ke data par aadhaarit prakaarya iske badale diram sthanon kaa upyog karegaa 
 sistar ke aadhaar par iske parinamswaroop kaary-nishpaadan main vruddhi ho bhi sakati he or nahin bhi ho sakati he
 In some systems the benefit may be hypothetical because bios are not used after booting in favor of direct hardware access
 beshak, jab shadowing ko sakriy rahata he tab kuch had tak kam mukt memory uplabdh rahati he
 Many new types of non-volatile RAM are under development which will keep the data safe even after the power supply is shut down

 From the year 1986 to 2000, CPU speed improved at an annual rate of 55% while memory speed improved by only 10%
 in pravritiyon ko dekhte hue yah ummid thi ki memory vilambtaa computer ke kaary-nishpaadan main ek bahut badi rukawat ban jaaegi
 Currently, CPU speed improvements have been greatly reduced, in part due to major physical constraints and in part by the current CPU design already affecting the memory wall in some sense
 intel ne apane platform 2015 pralekhan ) main in kaarnon kaa sankshep main khulaasa kiya he
 "firstly, as the geometry of the chip is reduced and the clock frequencies increase, the leakage of the current transistor is increased resulting in increased power consumption and heat

 The third thing is that traditional serial architectures are becoming less efficient for some applications while the processors are speeding up and at the same time reducing the benefits so that frequency increases can be bought in another way 
 Additionally, to some extent due to the limitation in the means of producing the inductance under solid-state devices, resistance latency in signal transmission) is increasing as the feature sizes become smaller which is putting an additional bottleneck
 Which does not indicate an increase in frequency
 " The RC latency in signal transmission has also been recorded at the end of the path of the clock rate versus IPC: traditional microarchitecture, which estimates an average of 12
5% in annual CPU performance improvement between 2000 and 2014

 But under the Bretton Woods system, the US dollar serves as a reserve currency reserve, so it also forms a part of the nation's official international reserve assets
 1944 se 1968 tak, fedral rigerv system ke madhyam se america dollar sone main parivartaneey tha, lekin 1968 ke baad hi kendriya bank dollar ko sarkari sone ke arakshit bhandar main kar sakaa or 1973 ke baad koi vyakti yaa sanstha arakshit sarkari sone ke bhandar se amareeki dollar ko sone main parivartit nahin kar sakaa
 Since 1973, major currencies have not yet been convertible into gold from government gold reserves
 vyaktiyon or sansthaaon ko ab anya vastuon kii tarah sona bhi nijee bazaaron main hi khareednaa chahie
 Although the USD and other currencies are no longer convertible into gold from government gold reserves, they can still function as official international reserve reserves
 ek lacheela vinimay dar pranali main sarkari antarrashtriya arakshit parisampattiyaan kendriya bank ko gharelu mudra kharidne kii anumati pradaan karti hai, jo kendriya bank ke liye ek deyta mana jaataa he ke rup main vaid mudra kaa mudran karata he
 This action can stabilize the value of the domestic currency
 vinimay dar ko prabhavit karne ke prayaas main duniya bhar main kendriya bainkon ne kabhi kabhi antarrashtriya arakshit nidhiyon kii kharid or bikri main sahyog pradaan kiya he
 As the central bank implements monetary policy, the amount of foreign exchange reserves can change accordingly
 kendriya bank jo ek niyat vinimay dar niti lagu karata use ek aisi sthiti kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he jahaan maang or aapurti mudra kii kam yaa ucch mulya nirdhaaran kii ore pravrutt kar saktaa he 
 ek lacheele vinimay dar ke daur main, ye kaary-pranaliyaan kendriya bank ke samashodhan ke saath videshi mudra kii kharid yaa bikri ke dwaara kisi bhi atirikt maang yaa aapurti ke saath swatah parichaalit hoti hai
 In times of mixed exchange rates, bands or similar changes make it their target) may require the use of non-sterilized or foreign currency exchange operations) to maintain the target exchange rate within a specified timeframe
 videshi mudra aaparishan jo ki anavaruddh hai ve sanchalan main gharelu mudra kii maatra main vistaar yaa sankuchan ke kaaran banenge or isliye maudrik niti or mudrasphiti ko sidhe prabhavit karte hai: ek vinimay dar kaa lakshya mudrasphiti ke lakshya se swatantra nahin rah saktaa
 aise desh jo nishchit vinimay dar lakshith nahin karte unhen asthaayee vinimay dar vaala mana jaataa he or ye bazaar ko hi vinimay dar nirdhaarit karne kii chhot de dete hai; jin deshon ke paas vinimay dar hai, maudrik niti ke anya upkaran aam taur par pasand kiye jate hai or ye videshi mudra vinimay hastkshep ke prakaar or raashi ko simit kar sakate hai
 Even those central banks that strictly limit foreign exchange intervention, while they may often perceive that the money market can be temporary and interfere with short-term counter disruptive activities
 agar maang bad jaati he to ek hi vinimay dar ko banaae rakhane ke liye, kendriya bank adhik gharelu mudra jari kar saktaa he or videshi mudra kharid saktaa he, jisase videshi mudra kii arakshit nidhi kii raashi main vruddhi hogi
 is maamle main, mudra kaa mulya ko neeche hi banaae rakhaa jataa he; chunki nahin he) gharelu mudra kii aapurti badhati rahati he, jisase gharelu mudrasphiti utpann ho sakati he 
 As the amount of foreign reserves available to protect a weak currency is limited, foreign exchange crisis or devaluation may result
 aisi mudra ke liye jisaki maang bahut he or adhik badhati hi jaati he, videshi mudra kaa arakshit bhandar saidhantik rup se lagaataar sanchit kiya ja saktaa he, haalanki ant main gharelu mudra kii aapurti main hui vruddhi se mudrasphiti paidaa ho sakati he or gharelu mudra ke liye maang main kami aa sakati he 
 vyavhaar main, kuch kendriya bank, khule bazaar ke parichaalan ke madhyam se apni mudra kii mulya-vruddhi rokane ke uddeshy se, ek hi samay main paryaapt arakshit bhandar kaa nirmaan kar sakate hai
 In practice, some central banks or currency systems operate at such a simple level and many other factors will affect the end result
 As some effects may take several months or may take years to become apparent, changes in foreign reserve reserves and currency values in the short term can be quite large as different markets react differently to incomplete figures
 aam taur par videshi mudra ke bade arakshit bhandar sarkaar ko adhik anukool aarthik maahaul uplabdh karaane ke liye sarkari vinimay dar main herpher karne kii anumati pradaan karte hai
 In theory, manipulation of foreign currency exchange rates provides stability that provides a gold standard, but in practice this is not the case
 iske alaava, ek desh ke paas jitani adhik se adhik videshi arakshit nidhi hogi, isamen behatar sthiti yahi hogi ki gharelu mudra par satta ke jokhimi hamale se ise bachaana hoga
 It costs to maintain large currency reserves

 Even in the absence of a currency crisis, fluctuations can result in huge losses

 In addition to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the purchasing power of the currency of the administration is reduced due to constant devaluation through inflation
 isliye, ek kendriya bank ko lagaataar iske arakshit bhandar kii maatra badhaane ke liye vinimay dar main herpher par apni prabhusatta banaae rakhni chahie
 Foreign exchange reserves provide a small return of interest
 baharhaal, yah kami mudrasphiti ke kaaran isi avadhi main us mudra kii kray-shakti kii kami se bhi kam ho sakati he, jiske parinamswaroop prabhavi rup main nakaaratmak pratifal paidaa ho sakate hai jise "ardh rajkoshiya laagat" ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In addition, large reserve reserves will be able to be invested in high-income assets
