 Contrary to user claims, spyware manufacturers argue that users have in fact agreed to install
 shairwayre anuprayogon ke bandal ke saath aane vaale spiware kaa varnan antarim-upyogkarta license samjhaute ke kanoonee kalevar kii baarikiyon main kiya ja saktaa he
 Many users habitually ignore these purported contracts, but spyware companies like Claria claim users' consent

 In most common law jurisdictions it has been established that a clickwrap agreement can be a binding contract under certain circumstances
 lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki har ek aisa samjhauta ek anubandh he yaa ki uskaa har shabd pravartaneey he
 The jurisdictions of some states, including Iowa and Washington in the United States, have passed legislation recognizing some forms of spyware as a crime

 june 2002 ko bade web prakashkon ne badi sankhya main vigyapanon kii jagah badal die jane ke liye Claria par mukadmaa kiya, lekin maamla adaalat se baahar nipat gaya
 The courts have not yet decided whether the advertiser is liable for spyware, which displays its advertisements by spyware
 kai maamalon main, aisi companiyaan, jinka vigyaapan spiware pop-ap main dikhaai padataa he, spiware company ke saath sidhe kaarobaar nahin karti hai
 Rather, they enter into an advertising agency agreement with an online subcontractor who receives payment based on the number of times the ad is "shown" or its presence
 kuch pramukh companiyaan, masalan ]] or ]] ne vigyaapan agency ko barkhaast kar diya, jinhone unka vigyaapan spiware main daalaa
 There was a case from both sides
 Since "spyware" has become infamous, some manufacturers have filed suit for libel and defamation whenever their product has been maligned
 In 2003, Garter filed a lawsuit against the website PC Pitstop for calling their program "spyware"
 PC pitstop kaa maamla is sahmati ke saath nipat gaya ki vah spiware shabd kaa upyog nahin karegaa, lekin gator / cleria software dwaara ho rahi haani ke bare main isane bayaan dena jari rakhaa
 natijatan, anya antispiware or antiveyras companiyaan bhi in utpaadon ke liye kai shabd jaise ki "sambhavit avaanchit program" yaa grevare kaa istemaal karne lagi
 To increase the risk of spyware, techniques to deal with it have also been removed
 inamen spiware ko dur karne yaa rokane ke liye dijayil kiye gaye program shaamil hai, saath hi upyogkartaaon ke liye vibhinn tarah ke prayog bhi jo pranali main spiware pravesh kii sambhaavna ko kam karte hai
 Nevertheless, spyware remains a costly problem
 jab badi sankhya main spiware ke khand Windows computer ko sankramati kar dete hai, tab upyogkarta ke paas data ko back-ap lene or prachaalan tantra ko phir se install karne ke sivaay or koi chaara nahin rah jaataa he
 For example, some versions of Vundo cannot completely remove Symantec, Microsoft, PC Tools and others because it indiscriminately infects rootkit, Internet Explorer, and Windows's lsass
exe with file-named dll
 kai programmer or kuch vyapaarik companiyon ne spiware ko dur karne yaa unhen rokane ke liye samarpit utpaada relies kiye hai
 These days, Steve Gibson's optout is the leader in this category
 programmer jaise ki Lavasoft kaa ad-aware SE or patric cola kaa Spybot - Search & Destroy unhen dur karne ke liye bahut hi prabhavi he, isliye dinondin lokapriy ho rahe hai or kuch maamalon main spiware prograamon ke liye avrodh paidaa karte hai
 On 16 December 2004, Microsoft acquired GIANT anti-spyware, renamed it Windows anti-spyware Beta, and released it free to Genuine Windows XP and Windows 2003 users
 2006 main, Microsoft ne beta software kaa naam Windows Defender diya or oktober 2006 main ise nickshulk downlod ke rup main relies kiya gaya tha or Windows Vista ke saath hi saath Windows 7 ke saath maanak ke rup main bhi ise shaamil kiya he
 Major anti-virus companies such as Symantec, mcafee and Sophos came later by adding anti-spyware features to their existing table of anti-virus products
 Initially, anti-virus companies expressed reluctance to add anti-spyware functions, citing a lawsuit by spyware authors against web site authors and programs that described their products as "spyware"
 However, recent versions of the home and business anti-virus products of these major companies have included anti-spyware functions, although they treat the virus differently
 udhaaharan ke liye, Symantec anti virus ke spiware program ko "vistaarit khatre" kii shrenee ke rup main rakhaa gaya he or ab yah isse samyochit sangrakshan kaa prastaav detaa he
 Recently, the anti-virus company]], the manufacturer of AVG anti-virus, acquired the anti-spyware company Evido Networks, re-named their Evido anti-spyware program the AVG anti-virus Professional Edition
 AGV used this product to add integrated anti-spyware solutions to some versions of its AGV anti-virus family of products, and the freeware AGV anti-spyware Free Edition is available for private and non-commercial use
 isse anti-virus companiyon kii spiware or mailaware samaadhaan prastut karne ke prati samarpan kii pravriti kaa pataa chalata he
 Zone Labs, the manufacturer of Zone Alarm firewalls, has also released an anti-spyware program
 anti-spiware program spiware se do tareekon se muqabla kar sakati he: Such programs monitor Windows registration contents, operating system files and installed programs, and remove files and entries that match the list of spyware components
 vaastavik-samay anti-virus suraksha ke saath spiware se vaastavik-samay suraksha abhinn rup se kaam karata he : downlod samay main hi software discs sanchikaon ko scan karata he or gyaat spiware pratinidhi ke ghatakon kii gatividhiyon ko roak detaa he
 In some cases, it also disrupts attempts to install start-up items or modify browser settings
 kyonki broujar ke anuchit laabh uthaane yaa upyogkarta kii truti ke kaaran bahut saare spiware or adware install ho jate hai, sandbox broujar main suraksha software kaa istemaal kisi tarah ke hue nuksaan rokane main madad karne main kargar ho saktaa he
 Earlier versions of anti-spyware programs focused primarily on detection and removal
 javakul software kaa ]], jo vaastavik-samay suraksha dene kaa prastaav denevaalon main pehla he, activex-aadhaarit or anya spiware program ke instolation ko roak diya
 Like most anti-virus software, many anti-spyware / adware tools frequently require an updated database of threats
 chunki nae spiware program relies ho chuke hai, anti-spiware developers unhen dhundhate hai or unka moolyankan karte hai, unhen hastakshar yaa paribhaasha banaate hai, jo software ko spiware kaa pataa lagane or use dur karne kii anumati detaa he
 As a result, the utility of anti-spyware software is limited without a regular source of updates
 kuch dukandaaron ek sadsyta-aadhaarit adhyatan kii seva pradaan karte hai, jabaki anya nickshulk adhyatan uplabdh karaate hai
 Updates can be installed automatically at a set time or before scanning or can be done manually
 sabhi program adhyatan paribhaasha par nirbhar karte hai
 Some programs are partially and some are historically negotiable
 ve kinhin vinyas ke parameter par najar rakhe hue hai or bagaiyr mulyankan yaa sifarish kiye kisi bhi parivartan kii jaankaree upyogkarta ko dete hai
 While they do not depend on updated definitions, which may allow them to catch new spyware, they do not provide guidance
 "maine kya kiya or yah vinyas kya samuchit parivartan karata he?" yah tay karnaa upyogkarta par chhod diya jaataa he
 Windows Defender's Spinet offers a community to share information by trying to dim it, both users who can rely on decisions made by others and analysts who can detect fast-spreading spyware

 ek lokapriy saamaanya spiware dur karne ke liye nipunata kii kisi nishchat maatra ke saath unke dwaara istemaal kiye janevaala kaa upkaran ]] he, jo Windows OS ke kuch kshetron, jahaan spiware aksar hua karte hai, ko scan karata he or manual rup se kaate janevaale item kii suchi pesh karata he
 Since most of the items are valid window files / registered entries, for those who do not have much information in this regard, they are advised to log on and post various anti-spyware sites so that the experts decide what to cut
 spiware program apane aap install ho jane se agar roka yaa iskaa intjaam nahin kiya gaya to yah ise radd karne yaa aninstall se roak saktaa he
 Some programs work in pairs: when an anti-spyware scanner terminates a running process, others reproduce the finished program
 isi tarah kuch spiware panjikrut kunjee kaa pataa lagane kii koshish karegaa or turant unhen phir se jod degaa
 aamtaur par, hathi kism ke spiware ko dur karne kaa kisi anti-spiware program ke paas ek badhia mauka sankramit computer ko sef mod main booting karne kii anumati detaa he
 By cutting the process tree can also work
 spiware kaa ek nayaa kism pranali main antarnihit pranali-vivechanaatmak prakriyaaon ko chhipaae rakhata he or sef mod main bhi start ap karata he, rootkit dekhen
 bagaiyr kisi prakriya ke hataane ke saath ve badi hi kadai se pataa karte hai or dur kar dete hai
 Sometimes they do not leave any mark on the disk
 The use of rootkit technology is growing, just as NTFS is used in alternative data streams
 nae spiware prograamon main jane-maane anti-melware utpaada se nipatane kaa upaay he or yah unhen chalaaye jane yaa install kiye jane or yahaan tak aninstall kiye jane se roak saktaa he
 An example of this is that Gromzone, a new type of malware, uses all three methods
 gupt rakhane ke liye yah vaikalpik data stream kaa prayog karata he
 The rootkit is also hidden from alternative data stream scanners and may actively prevent popular rootkit scanners from running
 vidweshi programmeron ne badi sankhya main dusht anti-spiware prograamon ko relies kar diya or vyapak rup se vitarit bev binar vigyaapan dwaara upyogkartaaon ko jhuthemooth kii chetavanee diya ki unka computer spiware se sankramati ho gaya he or ve aise prograamon ko kharidne kaa nirdesh dete hai jo darasal, spiware ko dur nahin karata he – yaa ulte unke apane bahut saare spiware daal detaa he
 According to recent proliferation of counterfeit and fraudulent anti-virus products can sometimes be a concern
 is tarah ke utpaada khud ko anti-spiware, anti-virus yaa registory clinner ke rup main pesh karte hai or kabhi-kabhi powep kii suvidha upyogkartaaon ko unhen install karne ko protsaahit karte rahete hai
 Such software is called rogue software

 spiware ko rokane ke liye computer upyogkarta ke paas anti spiware prograamon kii alaava kai tarah kii karypranaliyaan hai
 Many system operators install web browsers such as Opera, Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox in addition to IE
 haalanki koi bhi broujar puri tarah sef nahin he, internet explorer iske upyogkartaaon ke liye bahut bada aadhaar hone or isaki bhedyata jaise ki activex ke kaarnon kii vajah isamen spiware sankraman kaa bada khatra hota he
 Some isps - especially colleges and universities - take a different route to block spyware: they block known websites from where spyware is installed, using their network's firewalls and web proxies
 
 31 march 2005 ko carnell vishvavidhyalay ke soochna takanic vibhaag ne ek report relies kiya, jisamen proxi aadhaarit spiware, Marketscore ke ek vishesh khand ke vyavhaar kaa or vishvavidhyalay ne use rokane ke liye kya kadam uthayes iskaa vistaar se vivaran diya gaya tha
 Many other educational institutions also took similar steps
 Spyware programs that redirect network traffic cause technical-assistance problems; Instead of programs that rarely show advertisements or user behavior, it can attract the attention of institutions more quickly
 kuch upyogkarta bahut bade host file ko install karte hai, jo upyogkartaaon ke computer ko spiware se sambandhit web adress se judane se bachaata he
 However, spyware can bypass this type of protection when connecting to a numeric IP address instead of a domain name
 kisi shairwayre program dwaara prastaavit downlod ke jariye spiware install ho ja saktaa he
 Only programs downloaded from reputable source can provide some protection from attack from such source
 haal hi main cnet ne apane downlod nirdeshika kaa purnotthana kiya : isane kaha ki yah keval un file ko hi rakhega jo ad-aware or spiware doctor dwaara nirikshan main paarit kar diya gaya ho
 The first step to remove spyware is to "lockdown" the computer
 aisa vibhinn tareekon se kiya ja saktaa he, jaise anti-virus software kaa upyog karke yaa sidhe-sidhe computer ko internet se kaat kar
 internet ko kaat diya janaa spiware ke niyantrakon ko dur se computer ko niyantrit karne yaa us tak pahunchane se roktaa he
 The second step to remove spyware is to find out its status and remove it manually or through reliable anti-spyware software
 locdown ke dauraan yaa baad main sambhavit khatarnaak website se bachanaa chahie

 The AK 47 is considered to be the world's first and perhaps the best Assault rifle
 iskaa vikaas soviet sangh ke mikhail kalashnicove ne kiya tha, isi kaaran ise kabhi kabhi kalashnicove rifl bhi kaha jaataa he
 During the Second World War, the German Army developed the concept of assault rifle, they saw that most of the encounters were within the range of 300 meters, while the rifles and cartridges which were found in those days were more in terms of such short distance fighting
 was
 is liye sena ne is prakaar kii rifl or kaartoos kii maang kii jisame sabamshin ke gun bhi ho or yah 300 meter ke daayre main kaam karti ho
 As a result, the German Army STG 44 rifle came out, although it was not the first rifle of this type, the Italian Army also sei-rigotti and the Soviet Army's Federov Evamot rifle were of this category
 lekin german sena ne ye rifle bade paimaane pe prayog kii thi jis se unhen inkaa moolyankan karne kaa mauka mil gaya
 The Soviet Army was also influenced by the principles and philosophy of the German Army and started following them after World War II

 The rifle faced a lot of problems in the initial stages of production, the first models it encountered were the receivers of the stamped metal sheet, its guides and ejector trail were also difficult to weld, due to which it got bigger The scale had to be rejected but instead of stopping production, a heavy mechanical receiver was put in it
 It was a costly solution but after doing it the product The speed of the day was increased, then no new mechanical revavers were being installed, only the receivers of the earlier Mosin Nagat rifles were being used, due to this problem, these rifles could not be distributed in mass in the Soviet Army until 1956
 , And during this time only SKS Rifle was given to the army, Once the production problem was resolved, a new model was started to be given to the AKM army
this new model was equipped with a stamped sheet metal receiver
 It also had a hammer marker so that a limited number of rounds could be run while the automatic shot was fired, and the weapon would not suffer any damage, it is also called round redioser
 The new model was 1 / 3 less heavy than the old model
 This model is the most popular today and its production has been the highest till date, although generally this distinction is not known to Kisii
 It is not right to call all rifles AK47
 Some of them are akms, you can differentiate them in the picture given below, the total four differences of AK47 are as follows
 Original model of type 1 a / b AK47, 1b was changed for folding, is ricel kii khasayit he iskaa saral dizin, chota aakaar or bahut kam laagat main badi sankhya main nirmaan karne kii suvidha, isaki kathorta or bharosemandi myth ban chuki he, ise arctic jaisi sardi padane vaale ilaake ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaaya gaya tha isame bahut zyada kachra fasane ke baad bhi ye kaam kar sakati he, lekin iske chalate iske nishane utane achche nahin rah jate he, soviet laal sena ise samooh main prayog karne vaala hathiyaar maanati thi, is kaa saamaanya jivan kaal 20 se 40 saal mana jaataa he jo iske rakrakhaav pe nirbhar karata he, kuch eke 47 ke saath sangeen bhi laagaa ke di jaati he This rifle has an iron gauge on the back for ease of aiming, the front end of the rifle also has a gauge to assist in shooting, after adjusting them the user can easily aim for up to 250 meters
 Its interior parts like gas chamber, bore etc
 are plated with chromium which increases the life of this rifle and does not rust, modern Most of the cartridges of the cartridge contain parts of mercury which help in combating and melting any weapon
 is rifl ko saim automatic or automatic donon tareekon se chalaaya ja saktaa he is gas apretad rifl main rikoil takanic se puraane kartos girte jate ahi or iske jatke se nae kaartoos aa jate he This rifle can be dismantled very easily and you can see the operation and dismantling techniques in the manual given in the context

 The Kathasaritsagar composed by Somdev is the best, big and succulent adaptation of Gunadhya's magnum opus

 are also included in it

 lanbak kaa mul sanskrit rup 'lanbhak' tha
 The attainment of a woman by marriage was called "lambha" and the word Lambakha was used to describe her
 isiilie ratnaprabha lanbak, madanmanchuka lanbak, suryaprabha lanbak aadi alag-alag kathaon ke aadhaar par vibhinn sheershak die gaye honge
 The Kathasaritsagar is based on the multiplied Badkaha which was in the Paisachi language
 somdev ne swayan kathasaritsagar ke aarambh main kaha he : main brihatkatha ke saar kaa sangrah kar rahaa hoon
 Baddakha was composed by Gunadhaya during the reign of the Satavahana kings, whose time is believed to be around the first second century CE

 There were many meaningful boats and shipwrecks on the site and on the waterways
 at: vyapaariyon or unke sahakarmiyon ke manoranjanarth, desh-deshaantar-bhraman main praapt anubhavon ke aadhaar par anek kathaon kii rachana swaabhaavik thi
 Gunadhaya confounded the diverse stories prevalent among the Sarthas, sailors and medieval merchants as Badkhaha, confusing with his prodigious talent
 mul baddkaha ab prapya nahin he, parantu iske jo do roopaantar bane, unamem chaar ab tak praapt hai
 The oldest of these is the Buddhist scripture Shlokasangraha
 yah sanskrit main he or iskaa pranayan, ek mat se, lagbhag isa kii paanchavin shatee main tathaa duusare mat se, aathvin athwa naveen shatee main hua
 Originally it had 28 cantos and 4,539 verses, but now it is fragmented
 iske karta budhswami ne brihatkatha ko guptakaleen swarnyug kii samskruti ke anuroop dhaalane kaa ytn kiya he
 The Brihatkatha considers the Shlokasangraha to be the Nepalese reading of the Vidhana Brihatkha, but only its handwriting is found in Nepal, no other Nepalese influence is visible in it

 It was also composed often or possibly within 100 years of the epic scripture
 vasudev hinddi kaa aadhaar bhi yadhyapi brihatkatha hi he, to bhi granth ke thaat or uddeshy main kaaphi pherbadal kar diya gaya he
 The great story was merely a cosmic tale with narrations of various marriages of Vatsaraja Udayan's son Narvahanadatta, but Vasudeva Hindi incorporates several Jain-related themes, giving him the form of a scripture
 itnaa hi nahin, iskaa nayak narvahandutt na hokar, andhak vrishni vansh ke prasiddh purush vasudev hai
 The word "hindi" means 'tourism' or 'cruises'
 vasudev hindi main 29 lanbak hai or maharashtri praakrit bhashaa main gadhy style ke madhyam se lagbhag 11,000 shloke pramaan kii saamagree main vasudev ke 100 varsh ke paribhraman kaa vrittant he jisamen ve 29 vivaah karte hai
 All in all, it seems that Vasudeva Hindi is a sufficiently ancient adaptation of the legend

 Kshemendra was the Chairman of the assembly of Kashmir Naresh Anant
 unka mul naam vyasadaas tha
 The texts of Ramayanamanjari, Bharatamanjari, Avadanakalpala, Kalavilas, Deshopadesh, Narmamala and Samayamatruka find an excellent form of Kshemendra's genius

 raja, rajya or chhatra kii shakti or samprabhutaa kaa dyotak or kisi apradhi ko uske aparaadh ke nimitt di gayi sajaa ko dand kehete hai
 In another context, one of the four measures of Political Science - Sama, Daam, Dand and Bhed
 dand kaa shabdic arth 'danda' he jisase kisi ko peeta jaataa he
 In the sacramental area, the punishment mainly being held by Brahmachari Vidyarthi can be mentioned
 grihyasutron, smritiyon, unki tikaaon, vrihatsamhita tathaa saadharantaya dharamshastra ke anya granthon main tatsambandhi vishad vivaran milte hai
 Accordingly, when Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas are Sanskrit from Upanayana rites through Yagyavidhi by Acharya in different stages, they are also required to bear benign and observant punishments
 shastragat vidhaan or paramparaagat manyataayen ye hai ki brahman balak keshantaparyant vilvadand, kshatriya balak lalaatparyant palashdand or vaishyabalak nasikaparyant udumbar kaa dand dhaaran karen 
 The term punishment is mainly used in relation to political science and administration
 jiske dwaara aparaadhiyon ko dandit kiya jaay vahi dand he, kintu iskaa prayog hota he rajya or shashan kii seemaa ke bheetar
 When it is used outside the state's border towards any enemy, friend, mediator or indifferent state, it becomes one of the four measures of politics and it means military experiment
 in baton ke vichaar se sambandh rakhanevaala shaastra hota he dandashastra or uski niti hoti he dandniti
 Punishment is the science of government and administration, the basis of which is to follow morality and law, which applies equally to both the punisher and the punisher
 uske bina lokyatra sambhav nahin
 
 kaamandak nitisar or mahabharat kii paribhaasha ke anusaar aparaadhon kaa daman hi dand athwa "niti" kehalaata he
 The person who performs this work means the symbol of this quality is called 'dandi', because of Nayan
 shankaracharya ne kaamandak kii tikaa karte hue manusmriti ko uddhrut kiya he, jahaan yah kaha gaya he ki sampurna lok dand ke bhay ke kaaran hi jagat kaa bhoga sambhav ho paata he
 Clearly, punishment had a great importance in Indian political science which was expressed in both real and symbolic forms
 dand ke bare main manusmriti main bahut baaten kahi gayi hai
 Manu says that the one who is punished is the king, he is the preacher of justice and the ruler of all, he is the surety of the religion of the four varnas and ashrams
 vahi raja va dand praja kaa shashankartta, sab praja kaa rakshak, sote hue prajasth manushyon main jaagta he, isi liye budhimaan log dand hi ko dharm kehete hai
 If the king wears the punishment properly, he makes all the subjects happy and if he is tried without thinking, he kills the king from all sides
 vina dand ke sab varna arthath praja dooshit or sab maryaada chhin-bhinn ho jaati he
 Due to non-compliance of the punishment, all the people can be wrath against the king and the state system
 yah bhi kaha he ki dand bada tejomay he jise avidvan va adharmatma dhaaran nahin kar saktaa
 Then in such a situation, he destroys only the king without punishment and his family
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki jo raja vidya, sushiksha se rahit, vishyon main aasakt va mudh he, vah nyaay se dand ko chalaane main samarth kabhi nahin ho saktaa
 Punishment originated with the origin of statehood
 manusmriti or mahabharat main yah kaha gaya he ki maanav jati kii praarambhik sthiti atyant pavitra swabhaav, dosharahit karm, satvaprakruti or ritu kii thi, jab na to kisi raja kii sthiti thi, na rajya tha, na dand tha, na dandi tha or sabhi log dharm ke dwaara hi ek duusare kii raksha karte the
 But over a period of time, the effect of tamasunas began to increase, human society became disenchanted with its primitive essence nature and fishery justice came into being
 balvan kamajoro ko khaane lage
 In such a situation, the kingdom and the king were born and a punishment was imposed to keep everyone on the right path
 dand rajya shakti kaa pratik hua jo sari prajaaon kaa shaasha, rakshak tathaa sabhi ke sote hue jaaganevaala tha
 Hence punishment was accepted as religion
 isse spasht prathit hota he ki dharm kaa sadhak keval dand hi mana gaya
 The religion which also contains meaning and work, that is, the seeker of Dandh Trivarga was accepted
 adarsh se skhalan ko dur karne ke liye dand kii aavashyaktaa hui
 Punishment as a state power began to circulate in the judicial arena
 uskaa uddeshy tha samaaj or dharm kii manyataon or yathasthiti kii raksha karnaa
 She was known as the status quo religion and there were many types of religion based on differences of caste, caste, ashram, country, time, group, class, family and occupation, etc
 used to have
 dand kaa prayog karanevaala raja bhi yadi dharm kaa ulanghan kare to dand kaa bhaagi hota tha
 There was no religion beyond religion, religion was also the king of kings
 rajya kaa pradhan raja athwa anya koi shakti, yatha ganatantr kaa mukhiya nyaayiky sanghathan kaa pradhan avashya tha, kintu vidhi kaa pradhan vah kabhi nahin ho sakaa or vidhi ke ulanghan karne par dand usapar bhi savaar ho jaataa tha
 This sovereignty of law and punishment in India appears to have developed from the Brahmanical period to the era of Manusmriti and Mahabharata
 aadhunik vidhishastri dand ke chaar siddhanth maanate hai -- The very early stage of society in all countries was symbolic punishment, in which the principle of tooth for eye and tooth for tooth was followed
 vaidic sahitya kii "jeevagrubh" jaisi sangyaayen is baat kii dyotak hen ki bhartiya itihaas ke atyant praarambhik kaal kaa nyaay kathor or pratikaratmak hi tha
 This theory holds that by punishing one criminal severely, other people are afraid of committing a crime
 nishedhaatmak siddhanth kii manyata he ki apradhi ko dand dene se jiske prati aparaadh hua he use uskaa 'badla' mil jaataa he
 This is the worst of all theories because it does not have the welfare of society or the sense of security of society
 teesri avasthaa main dand kaa swaroop pratikaratmak ke badale avarohak ho gaya
 The reason for this was to intervene in the kingdom holding the punishment instead of dealing with the guilty man
 vyaktigat badale kii bhaavana ko samaapt kar rajkeey dand kii mahima ko sthapit karnaa rajya kaa uddeshy or uski badhati hui shakti kaa dyotak ho gaya
 It was now impossible to get revenge in criminal cases, even though it was considered valid to get some revenge on a person convicted by imprisonment etc
 in civil cases
 kintu kathor - kabhi kabhi to atyant krur or asabhy dandon kaa diya janaa praayah niyam sa tha
 If we look at the punishments of the Upanishads, the punishments mentioned in the Buddhist scriptures, the recommendations of handcuffing by economics and its confirmations made by Megasthenes, or the punishments prevailing on both East and West up to the beginning of medieval and somewhat modern times
 If we think about it, we have to say that they were very cruel and barbaric in modern terms
 unka uddeshay tha auron main aparaadh karne ke prati bhay utpann karnaa
 These include mutilation, being burned alive, capital punishment, life imprisonment and punishments full of unbearable torture
 nirodhak dandon main aparaadh ke kaaran athwa uske bhavishya ke karta ko hi usase roak dene kaa upaay kiya jaataa he, jo uski vyaktigat swatantraaa chhinakar sampann hota he
 The Prevention of Jail Legislation of India is in this category
 chauthaa or sarvottam dand kaa prakaar he sudharatmak
 Even in the course of the development of civilization, although all countries have been subjected to severe obstructive punishments against potential culprits and to present fear of punishments, corrective tendencies have sometimes arisen
 pracheen rome main doshi kii swatantraaa kaa haran maatr hi sabase bada dand mana gaya or uske baad koi yatnaa aavashyak nahin samajhi gai 
 In India, Kautilya mentions the imprisonment to make atonement and to purify them by the system of making sense of their sins
 ashok ne bhi apane chaturth stambhalekh main vyavahaarasmta or dandsamta ke saath shuddhacharitra, dharmarat or sadvyavhaari doshiyon ke dandon ko kam karne kaa aadesh diya he
 These things are indicative of the corrective tendency of penal legislation
 smritiyon main dhigdand athwa vagdand kii charchaayen aati hai, jo sarvada kaaydand or vadhadand se pehle aata tha
 It meant that if the work goes on with just social condemnation, then what is the need of harsh torture? One rule was acceptable and that the punishment should be "as it is" and it should be given only when there is an offense
 20veen shatee main dandvidhaan ko sudharatmak swaroop dene ke praytn ho rahe hai
 In 1872, a meeting was held in London to decide an international form of international prison reform and punishment
 baad main tatsambandhi samuhik sanghatan bhi sthapit hue par uske sadsy adhikanshat: europea desh hi rahe
 Gradually, instead of harsh punishments, the moral life of the imprisoned convict was revived
 usamen bhay kii apeksha aashaa adhik rakhi jane lagi he
 In the corrective principle of punishment, it is legislated on the basis of the guilty status, social environment and situation
 dosha ke liye samaaj or vaataavaran ko bhi uttaradaayi mana jaataa he
 Therefore, the use of psychological measures to improve the guilty, its individual level consideration, the system of reforms for the guilty children, industrial education, general education, moral and religious discourse and other well-planned arrangements are made
 bharatvarsh main bhi kuch anya deshon kii tarah karagraston ko bandhanevaale baandhon, sadakon athwa anya nirmaanon main naukari or mazdooree karaane athwa audyogic shikshaaon ke dwaara samajopayogi or parivarasevi banane ke praytn prarambh hai
 It is not impossible that kidnapping of personal liberty should be considered as the greatest punishment in a few centuries and human nature should become so sublime and sacred that punishments like life imprisonment and life imprisonment are not required

 Excavation of the canal began in April 1842
 cotli ne nahar ke nirmaan main prayukt hone vaali eenton ke liye bhatthon kii sthapana kii
 Initially, Cottley faced opposition from the Hindu priests of Haridwar, who thought that capturing the waters of the holy Ganges river would not be right, Cautley pacified them by saying that they would leave a gap in the dam to be built
 With this, the water of the Ganges will flow freely
 iske alaava cotli ne pujaariyon ko khush karne ke liye nadi kinare sthit snaan ghaaton kii marammat karaane kaa vaada bhi kiya
 Cottley also inaugurated the canal construction work with the worship of Lord Ganesha

 Sridharacharya was a great mathematician of ancient India

 Our information about them is very scarce
 unke samay or sthaan ke bare main nishchit rup se kuch bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 But it is estimated that his life span was between 870 AD and 930 AD; They originated in the present Hooghly district; His father's name was Baldevacharya and Mataji's name was Achhoka
 inhone 750 i

 Patigit, Patidan Sar and Trishtika are his available compositions, which are basically related to arithmetic and field behavior
 bhaskaracharya ne bijganit ke ant main - brahmagupta, shridhar or padmanabh ke bijganit ko vistrut or vyapak kaha he - :'brahmahnayashridharapadmanabhabijani yasmadativistrutani'
 From this it appears that Sridhar had also composed a large book on algebra which is no longer available
 bhaskar ne hi apane bijganit main varg samikarnon ke hal ke liye shridhar ke niyam ko uddhrut kiya he - ax2 + bx + c = 0 4a2x2 + 4abx + 4ac = 0 ; 4a2x2 + 4abx + 4ac + b2 = 0 + b2; + 4ac = b2 + 4ac = b2 2 = b2 - 4ac 2 = 2; atah x ke do mul nimnlikhit hai- First root α =) / 2a doosraa mul β = ) / 2a Ie rogi kii seva-shushrusha ko paricharya yaa nursing kehete hai
 The word nurse in English means 'nutrition'
 nurse vah stri hoti he jo shishu kaa poshan karti he; maan bhi ek prakaar se nurse he, vah purush bhi nurse he jo shishuon kii athwa rogi kii dekhbhaal karata he
 Activism is reflected by the word care
 yah upkaar kaa kaam he or aise vyakti ke liye kiya jaataa he jo swayan use apane liye nahin kar saktaa
 Thus care is a profession, but it requires characterful women who are firm in the divine rules and who are firm on the principles of truth and do whatever is appropriate, no matter what the situation, regardless of the outcome
 
 paricharya kaa itihaas vedon ke pracheen kaal se aarambh hota he, jab rugan vyakti kii dekhbhaal tathaa shushrusha kaa kaary samaaj main bade aadar kii drushti se dekha jaataa tha

 Proficient in laying and cleaning, should be prompt, patient, skilled and obedient in the care of the afflicted

 In the modern sense of the responsibility of the physician towards his patient, apart from giving only physical pleasure, medical treatment and treatment, it is also expected that he should have clear knowledge of the disease and how that disease affects a patient
 samay-samay par jo naveen lakshan ubhare unke prati use atyant sajag rahanaa chahie
 He should know what kind of treatment will benefit the patient, and should know clearly what kind of care is required for each patient and how to take care of them

 There are also any number of subdivisions of care, for example, in the hospital, these types of care are made according to medical type - child care, heart care, orthopedic care, caries, pregnancy care, general pharmacological and surgical care, Care of brain diseases, Care of contagious diseases etc
 swasth raashtra ke nirmaan main nurse ko bahut mahatvuparn kaary karnaa padataa he
 Absence of disease is not called health, health is definitely the name of living, that is, a condition in which there is complete physical, mental and social heartlessness
 rogi ko aspataal main swasthyalabh karne ke uparaant pun: pehle jaise asvachh vaataavaran main hi lautaa dena swasth raashtra ke nirmaan kii disha main koi pragati nahin maani ja sakati
 Nurses will have to convey the spirit of quadruple health and they have to understand that if hygiene is maintained then most of the grief will go away automatically
 norsen hi logon ko swasth jivan vyateet karne kaa maarg acchhee tarah bataa sakati hai
 They should educate the patient and his family about those things so that they can keep their door well even after the nurse leaves

 Before birth, at birth, in infancy, childhood and adolescence, wherever and wherever he is, he has to take care of the child at home, at school, in hospital, in the street, in the field

 He has to take the position of teacher, counselor and friend
 balak paricharya kii prayek nurse ko bacchon kii dekhbhaal ke vishesh gyaan or adhik kaushal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he taaki vah unki vaigyanik paricharya kar sake
 The time for the child is most acute when he is brought to the hospital
 vah apni maan ko chhodkar ek nae sansar main pahunchataa he, jahaan vah yah nahin jaanata ki uske saath kya kiya janevaala he
 His resentful mental balance and acute impulses make him more vulnerable to illness
 aisi dasha main aushadhopchaar se bhi badhkar aspataal main uski nijee dekhbhaal kaa mahatv he
 It is the main task of a nurse nurse for the child to get the trust of the child and tell him all things in advance so that he can be prepared for the medical and the work being done by the doctor
 bachche ko pehle se bataae bina hi yadi aakasmik rup se kuch kiya jaataa he to vah nishchay hi uskaa virodh karata he
 a nurse in cardiac care has special responsibilities and is trained in the same way
 hriday ke bahut se rog aarambhik pidaa shant ho jane ke uparaant apane rog ke sambandh main anashyak saavdhaanee nahin baratate
 The nurse who attains the remarkable confidence of the patient and complete dependence on himself, who understands the intentions of the patient's physical postures, who can mold his way of living in such a way that the patient is not troubled, the same nurse proved worthy and successful for cardiac care
 Might be possible
 maansik rogiyon kii sanbhaal ke liye nurse bahut adhik kaushal kii apeksha hoti he
 The nurse has to do her job very carefully among the patients
 uskaa vyavhaar or uski atmiyatapurna dekhbhaal nishchay hi rogi ke liye kisi bhi aushadhi se adhik upyogi hoti he
 The nurse should have every kind of knowledge in relation to the patient and he must know those things properly, which causes the patient's mental balance to deteriorate
 rogiyon ke saath use dhairya, sahanubhuti or kaushal se is prakaar vyavhaar karnaa padataa he, maanon ve uske mitra or priyajan hon, kyonki maansik rogi saadhaaran-si baat se hi udign ho uthte hai or thodi-si bhi udignata chikitsa or upachaar se hue samast laabh ko ek kshan main nasht kar sakati he
 These are some examples of special skills of nurses
 prayek vishesh kshetra main nurse ke kuch vishesh kartavya rahete hai
 He can benefit from nursing only if he has complete knowledge of the situation

 padmavati yaa padmini chittod ke raja ratnasingh kii rani thi
 The historical existence of the name of this Rajput queen is very doubtful, and its historical existence has often been accepted as imaginary by historians
 is naam kaa mukhya strot malik mohammad jaaysi krit 'padmavat' naamak mahakavy he
 All the other historical sources or texts which describe 'padmavati' or 'padmini' are all successors of 'padmavat'
 itihaas granthon main adhiktar 'padmini' naam sweekaar kiya gaya he, jabaki jaaysi ne spasht rup se 'padmavati' naam sweekaar kiya he
 It is clear from Jaisi's description that he also means 'padmini' with the highest rank of women
 jaaysi ne spasht likhaa he ki raja gandharvasen kii solah hajaar padmini raniyaan thim, jinamein sarvshereshth rani champavati thi, jo ki pataraani thi
 Padmavati was born from this Champavati's womb
 is prakaar katha ke praathmik strot main hi spasht rup se 'padmavati' naam hi sweekrut hua he
 According to Jayasi, Padmavati was the daughter of King Gandharvasen of Sinhala Island, and Raja Ratan Sen of Chittor, disguised as a yogi, went there and married her after many years of effort and brought her to Chittor
 vah adwitiya sundari thi or ratansen ke dwaara niraadrit kavi-pandit-tantric raghav chetan ke dwaara uske rup kaa varnan sunakar dilli ke sultan allaudin khilji ne chittorgarh par akraman kar diya tha
 Even after 8 months of war, Alauddin Khilji could not conquer Chittor, then returned and after a second attack, he tricked King Ratansen with deceit and asked for Padmavati as a condition of returning him
 tab padmavati kii ore se bhi chal kaa sahaara liya gaya or gora-badal kii sahaayta se anek veeron ke saath vesh badalakar palakiyon main padmavati kii sakhiyon ke rup main jaakar raja ratansen ko mukt karaayaa gaya
 But as soon as this trick was detected, Alauddin Khilji launched a strong attack, in which almost all the Rajput warriors who went to Delhi were killed
 raja ratansen chittod lautaa parantu yahan aate hi unhen kumbhalaner par akraman karnaa padaa or kumbhalaner ke shaasha devpal ke saath yuddh main devpal maaraa gaya parantu raja ratansen bhi atyadhik ghayal hokar chittod lautaa or swarg sidhaar gaya
 There again Alauddin Khilji was attacked
 rani padmavati anya solah sau striyon ke saath johar karke bhasma ho gayi tathaa kile kaa dwaar khol kar ladate hue saare rajput yoddha maare gayi
 Alauddin Khilji did not find anything other than ashes
 karnal tod ne apane rajasthan ke itihaas main jaaysi ke ukt kathanak main kuch her-pher ke saath praayah usee kahani ko doharaaya he
 Colonel Todd's description has remained historically very low mainly due to writing based on the stories of the Bhatas
 unhone raja ratnasingh yaa ratansen ke badale bhimasi kaa naam diya he or vah bhi vastutah rana nahin balki rana lakhamasi ke chachaa the jo ki lakshmana singh ke bachche hone ke kaaran shashan sambhaal rahe the
 Colonel Tod reckons the beginning of Bhimsingh's rule as Laxman Singh and his patron in 1275 AD; While it is well known that Alauddin Khilji was attacked in 1303 AD
 isi prakaar karnal tod ne padmini ko sinhal dweep ke chouhan vanshi hamir shankh kii ladki batalaaya he
 Except for these changes, the rest of the story is often Padmavat, with exceptions
 14 veen or 16 veen shatabdi ke bich jain granth- nabinandan jenudhar, chitai charitra or rain sehara ne rani padmini kaa ullekh kiya he
 Tejpal Singh Dhama has proved her the princess of Sri Lanka on the basis of texts published from Jaffna in her famous research novel Agni Ki Flames
 inaki kahani jaaysi ke padmavat se thodi alag he
 There has been considerable churn among historians for the attacks of Rani Padmini, Raja Ratnasinh and Alauddin Khilji
 is sandarbh main sarvaadhik uddhrut tathaa pramanbhoot mahamahopadhyaay rhibahadur gaurishankar hirachand ojha kaa mat mana gaya he
 In the context of the story of Padmavat, Ojha ji has clearly written that "in the absence of history, people have considered Padmavat as a historical book, but in reality it is a poetic tale of today's historical novels, whose body is composed on these historical things
 That Ratansen, the king of Chittor, Padmini or Padmavati was his queen and Alauddin was the Sultan of Delhi, who fought with Ratansen and took away the fort of Chittor
 bahudhaa anya sab baaten katha ko rochak banane ke liye kalpit khadi kii gai he; kyonki ratnasingh ek baras bhi rajya karne nahin paaya, aisi dasha main yogi ban kar us kii sinhaladweep tak janaa or vahaan kii rajkumaari ko byaah laana kaise sambhav ho saktaa he
 At that time, the king of Sinhala Dweep should not be Gandharvasen, but the king Kirtinishshank Dev should be Parakramabahu or Bhuvanak Bahu
 sinhaladweep main gandharvasen naam kaa koi raja hi nahin hua
 Kumbhalner was not even inhabited by that time, so how should Devpal be considered the king of there? After fighting for Chittor for 8 years, Alauddin did not return to Delhi disappointed but after fighting for six months, he had taken Chittor, he had climbed Chittor only once, so the story of the second coming is fictitious
 " Thus, it becomes clear that finding historicity in the legend of the epic Padmavat epic is meaningless to a great extent
 kuch naam aitihaasik avashya hai, parantu ghatnaayen adhikanshtah kalpit hi hai
 Some events which are historical are also related to 1531 AD rather than 1303 AD
 isi prakaar karnal tod kaa varnan bhi kaaphi had tak anaitihaasik hi he
 In this context, Ojha ji has a clear statement that "colonel Tod has written this story especially on the basis of the Bhatas of Mewar and the Bhats have taken him from 'padmavat'
 bhaaton kii pustakon main samar singh ke peeche ratnasingh kaa naam na hone se taad ne padmini kaa sambandh bhimsingh se milaayaa or use lakhamasi ke samay kii ghatana maan lee
 According to the statements of such Bhats, Tad also wrote Lakhmsi to be the child and the king of Mewar, but Lakhmsi was neither king of Mewar nor child, but was feudatory of Sisode and had reached old age at that time, because he To pay his salt with seven sons, he was killed while fighting in the battle with Alauddin as the head of Ratnasinha's army, as in Shilale of Kumbhalgarh of Vikram Samvat 1517
 Has been told above
 isi tarah bhimasi lakhamasi kaa chachaa nahin, kintu dada tha, jaisaa ki rana kumbhakarna ke samay ke 'eklingamahatmaya' main paaya jaataa he
 In such a situation, even Tad's statement cannot be credible
 'padmavat', 'tarikh phirishta' or taad ke rajasthan ke lekhon kii yadi koi jad he to keval yahi ki allaudin ne chittod par chadhaai kar chah maas ke ghere ke ananthar use vijay kiya; vahaan kaa raja ratnasingh is ladaai main lakshmanasingh aadi kai saamanto sahit maaraa gaya, uski raani padmini ne kai striyon sahit johar kii agni main pranahuti di; is prakaar chittod par thode-se samay ke liye musalamaanon kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 Everything else is often imagined
 " The majority of the above quoted opinion of Ojha ji has been accepted by almost all historians
 dow0 laal ne bhi apni pustak 'history of the Khaljis, main likhaa he ki kahani ke paramparaagat varnan ko taak par rakhane ke pashchaat nagn satya yah he ki sultan allaudin ne 1303 isvi main chittod par akraman kiya or aath maah ke vikat sangharsh ke pashchaat use adhikrut kar liya
 The brave Rajput warriors stayed in the field fighting the invaders and the brave Rajput women were buried in the flame of Jauhar
 jo striyaan samadhisth huin, unamem sambhawatah ratnasingh kii ek rani bhi thi, jiskaa naam padmini tha
 Apart from these facts, everything else is a literary structure and there is no historical support for it
 isi prakaar kaa mat dow0 es0 el0 nagori evam jithesh nagori kaa bhi he
 It has been considered the first school of Chittor
 kaha jaataa he ki khilji ne kile par apni vijay pataakaa fahraakar vahaan ke 30,000 nagarikon ko maut ke ghat utaara
 Many historians have rejected both Padmini's name and existence; But after enough consideration, many historians like Dr
 Ashirwadi Lal Shrivastava and Dr
 Gopinath Sharma have accepted the existence of Padmini, considering many things in the story as unnatural, as expressed in the above opinion of Ojha ji
 dow0 gopinath sharma ne likhaa he ki "hamaare vichaar se yah maananaa kii padmini kii katha parampara jaaysi ke padmavat se aarambh hoti he vah sarvatha bhram he
 The Chitaicharit, which was written many years before Jayasi, describes the Chittor invasion of Padmini and Alauddin
 hemratan ke gora-badal chaupai main; tathaa labdhoday ke padmini charitra main is katha ko swatantra rup se likhaa gaya he
 


 This story has come in the form of a pure and healthy tradition according to a Rajput system, it is not right to reject it easily
 ho saktaa he ki kai baaten paath bhed se tathaa varnan style se vibhinn rup main prachlit rahi hon, kintu unka aadhaar satya se hatakar nahin dhundha ja saktaa
 The architecture testifies that there are palaces of Padmini in Chittor and that of Padmini Tal which still reminds of that elaborate and controversial woman
 padmini ke sambandh main di gayi sabhi ghatnaayen sambhavtah satya kii kasuti par thik nahin utren, kintu padmini kii vidyamanata, akraman ke samay uski sooyeeboojh, uske dwaara johar vrath kaa netritv aadi ghatnaon kaa ek swatantra mahatv he
 " vastutah allaudin khilji ke akraman evam yuddh kaa pramukh kaaran allaudin kii samrajyavaadee mahatvakanksha evam chittod kii sainik evam vyapaarik upyogita thi
 The trade routes of Gujarat, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh, United Provinces, Sindh etc
 passed through Chittor
 swaabhaavik he ki allaudin khilji jaisaa sultan aise kshetra par avashya adhikaar praapt karnaa chahta
 There is no doubt that Alauddin's main intention for the Chittor invasion was political, but when he came to know about the beauty of Padmini, the desire to take him became more intense

 bharat kaa vibhaajan mountbeton yojana ke aadhaar par nirmit bhartiya swatantraaa adhinium 1947 ke aadhaar par kiya gaya
 It was said in this act that on 15 August 1947, two autonomous investments will be made called the Dominion of India and Pakistan and the British Government will hand over power to them
 swatantraaa ke saath hi 14 agast ko pakistan adhirajya or 15 agast ko bhartiya sangh kii sansthapana kii gai
 In this development, mainly the province of Bengal in British India was divided into East Pakistan and West Bengal state of India and similarly Punjab province of British India was divided into Punjab province of western Pakistan and Punjab state of India
 isi dauraan british bharat main se ceylone or burma ko bhi alag kiya gaya, lekin ise bharat ke vibhaajan main nahin shaamil kiya jaataa he
 Similarly, the partition of Pakistan in 1971 and the establishment of Bangladesh are also not counted in this development
 15 agast 1947 kii aadhi raat ko bharat or pakistan kanoonee taur par do swatantra raashtra bane
 But Pakistan's power conversion rituals were performed in Karachi on 14 August so that the last British Viceroy Louis Mountbatten, both in Karachi and New Delhi could participate in the rituals
 isliye pakistan main swatantraaa diwas 14 agast or bharat main 15 agast ko manaaya jaataa he
 Crores of people were affected by the partition of India
 vibhaajan ke dauraan hui hinsa main kareeb 5 lakh log maare gaye or kareeb 1
45 karod sharnaarthiyon ne apana ghar-baar chhodkar bahumat sampradaay vaale desh main sharan lee
 The British rulers of India always followed the policy of "divide and rule" in India
 unhone bharat ke nagarikon ko sampradaay ke anusaar alag-alag samoohon main baant kar rakhaa
 Some of his policies discriminated against Hindus and some against Muslims
 20veen sadi aate-aate musalmaan hinduon ke bahumat se darane lage or hinduon ko lagane laga ki british sarkaar or bhartiya netaa musalamaanon ko visheshadhikaar dene or hinduon ke prati bhedbhaav karne main lage hai
 Therefore, when the spirit of independence began to emerge in India, the leaders of both sects were competing in controlling the freedom struggle
 san 1906 main dhaka main bahut se musalmaan netaaon ne milakar muslim lig kii sthapana kii
 These leaders were of the view that Muslims had less rights than majority Hindus and that the Indian National Congress represented Hindus
 muslim lig ne alag-alag samay par alag-alag maangen rakhin
 In a speech by the famous Urdu poet Muhammad Iqbal at the conference of the Muslim League in 1930, for the first time raised the demand for a separate state for Muslims
 1935 main sindh praant kii vidhaan sabha ne bhi yahi maang uthaai
 Iqbal and Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar asked Muhammad Ali Jinnah to support this demand
 is samay tak jinna hindu-muslim ekta ke paksh main lagate the, lekin dhire-dhire unhone aarope lagaana shuru kar diya ki congressi netaa musalamaanon ke hiton par dhyaan nahin de rahe
 At the 1940 Muslim League Conference in Lahore, Jinnah clearly stated that he wanted two different nations
 hindu mahasabha jaise hindu sanghathan bharat ke bantwaare ke prabal virdohi the, lekin maanate the ki hinduon or musalamaanon main matbhed hai
 In a speech at the conference of Hindu Mahasabha in Allahabad in 1937, Veer Savarkar said - India is not a nation today, there are two nations here - Hindu and Muslim
 congress ke adhiktar netaa panth-nirpeksh the or sampradaay ke aadhaar par bharat kaa vibhaajan karne ke viruddh the
 Mahatma Gandhi believed that Hindus and Muslims could live together and they should live together
 unhone vibhaajan kaa ghor virodh kiya: "meri puri aatma is vichaar ke viruddh vidroh karti he ki hindu or musalmaan do virdohi mat or samskritiyaan hai
 To approve such a doctrine is like rejecting God for me
 " bahut saalon tak gandhi or unke anuyaayiyon ne koshish kii ki musalmaan congress ko chhod kar na jaaen or is prakriya main hindu or musalmaan garam dalon ke netaa unase bahut chidh gaye
 The British plannedly promoted suspicion of both Hindu and Muslim sects
 muslim lig ne agast 1946 main sidhi kaarywahi diwas manaaya or kalakatta main bheeshan dange kiye jisamen kareeb 5000 log maare gayi or bahut se ghayal hue
 In such an environment, all the leaders were under pressure to accept the partition so that the country does not come completely into a state of war
 bharat ke vibhaajan ke dhaanche ko '3 june plan' yaa mountbaton yojana kaa naam diya gaya
 The boundary between India and Pakistan was set by Sir Cyril Radcliffe, a London lawyer
 hindu bahumat vaale ilaake bharat main or muslim bahumat vaale ilaake pakistan main shaamil kiye gaye
 On 18 July 1947, the British Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act which finalized the process of partition
 is samay british bharat main bahut se rajya the jinke raajaaon ke saath british sarkaar ne tarah-tarah ke samjhaute kar rakhe the
 These 565 states were given the freedom to choose who they would like to join India or Pakistan
 adhiktar rajyon ne bahumat dharm ke aadhaar par desh chunaa
 There was a lot of controversy in the integration of the states whose rulers chose the country which suited the majority religion
 vibhaajan ke baad pakistan ko sanyukt raashtra main nae sadsy ke rup main shaamil kiya gaya or bharat ne british bharat kii kursi sanbhali
 The wealth of British India was shared between the two countries but this process began to drag on for too long
 gandhiji ne bharat sarkaar par dabaav daalaa ki vah pakistan ko dhan jaldi bheje jabaki is samay tak bharat or pakistan ke bich yuddh shuru ho chukaa tha or dabaav badhaane ke liye anshan shuru kar diya
 The Indian government had to succumb to this pressure and send money to Pakistan
 22 oktober 1947 ko pakistan ne kashmir par akraman kar diya, usase purv mountbaton ne bharat sarkaar se pakistan sarkaar ko 55 karod rupee kii raashi dene kaa paraamarsh diya tha
 The Union Cabinet decided to postpone giving this amount in view of the attack but at the same time Gandhi started a fast-unto-death to get this amount immediately, as a result of which this amount was given to Pakistan against the interests of India
 nathuram godse ne mahatma gandhi ke is kaam ko unki hatya karne kaa ek kaaran bataaya
 Many scholars believe that the British government did not handle the process of partition properly
 chunki swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa pehle or vibhaajan kii ghoshnaa baad main kii gayi, desh main shanti kaayam rakhane kii jimmevary bharat or pakistan kii nayi sarkaron ke sar par ai
 Nobody thought that many people would go from here
 logon kaa vichaar tha ki donon deshon main alpamat sampradaay ke logon ke liye suraksha kaa intazaam kiya jayega
 But the new governments of the two countries did not have the necessary arrangements to deal with violence and crime
 falswaroop danga fasaad hua or bahut se logon kii jane gayi or bahut se logon ko ghar chhodkar bhaagna padaa
 It is estimated that about 5 to 3 million people died during this period, some in riots and some due to travel difficulties

 In the months following Partition, there was a massive mass transfer between the two new countries
 pakistan main bahut se hinduon or sikhon ko balaat beghar kar diya gaya
 But in India Gandhiji pressurized the Congress and ensured that Muslims could stay in India if they wanted

 According to the displaced census of 1951, 72,26,000 Muslims left India after partition and went to Pakistan and 72,49,000 Hindus and Sikhs left Pakistan
 isamen se 78 pratishat sthanantaran pashchim main, mukhyatya punjab main hua
 The transfer of power to India and Pakistan in August 1947 was the first significant step by Britain towards ending colonial rule, with far-reaching consequences for its international power
 bharat kaa yah vibhaajan atharahavin sadi main europe, asia, africa or madhya purv main kiye gaye anek vibhaajanon main se ek he
 In most of the divisions, the violence took place in this division much more than the violence between different religious communities

 He also divided Ireland, Palestine and Cyprus
 usne in vibhaajanon kaa kaaran yah bataaya ki alag-alag samudaayon ke log ek saath milakar nahin kar sakate
 While these divisions were not only due to religious and racial reasons, it also included the strategic and political interests of Britain, on the basis of which it made its strategy at the time of the pacts and carried out partitions

 Many writers have written novels and stories on the Partition of India and the riots that have taken place, the main of which are pinjar ko film or tamas ko prasiddh doordarshan dharawahik ke rup main roopantarit kiya gaya he
 Apart from this the hot air, the meaning of Deepa Mahta, Kamal Hasan's Hey Ram are also based on the partition of India

 brahmaji ke putr daksh prajapati kaa vivaah swymbhuv manu kii putree prasuti se hua tha
 Maternity gave birth to sixteen girls out of which a girl named Swaha was married to Agni Dev, a girl named Swadha with Pitrigan, a girl named Sati married to Lord Shankar and the remaining thirteen girls were married to Dharma
 dharm kii patniyon ke naam the- shraddha, maitri, dayaa, shaanti, tushti, pushti, kriya, unnati, buddhi, medha, titiksha, hri or murti
 After Daksha became Prajapati, Brahma gave him a task under which to reconcile Shiva and Shakti
 us samay shiv tathaa shakti donon alag the
 That is why Brahma Ji told Daksh that he meditated and please Shakti Mata and get her as a daughter
 tapasya ke uparaant mata shakti ne daksh se kaha,"main aapaki putree ke rup main janm lekar shambhu kii bharya banungi
 When the virtue of your austerity is diminished and you are disrespected by me, then i will go to my abode with my illusion to dislodge the world
 is prakaar sati ke rup main shakti kaa janm hua
 Prajapati Daksha has three views on the form of being nomadic to Lord Shiva
 ek mat ke anusaar prarambh main brahma ke paanch sir the
 Brahma used to perform Vedpath with his three heads and abused Veda with two heads so that Shiva cut off one of his heads
 brahma daksh ke pita the
 So Daksha became angry and started talking to Shiva for revenge
 lekin yah mat anya pramanik sandarbhon se khandit ho jaataa he
 In the Srimad Bhagavathamaha Purana it is clearly described that Brahma had only four heads at the time of birth
 duusare mat ke anusaar shakti dwaara swayan bhavishyavaanee rup main daksh se swayan ke bhagwaan shiv kii patni hone kii baat kah diye jane ke baavjood daksh shiv ko sati ke anuroop nahin maanate the
 So, when Sati was married, she organized a swayamvara for him and did not call Shiva in it
 phir bhi sati ne 'shivaay namah' kahkar varmala prithvi par daal di or vahaan prakat hokar bhagavan shiv ne varmala grahan karke sati ko apni patni banaakar kailash chale gayi
 Thus Daksha did not like Shiva because of his daughter Sati choosing Shiva as her husband against her will
 teesraa mat sarvaadhik prachlit he
 According to this, on the arrival of Daksha in a yajna of Prajapati, all the gods got up and respected him, but Shiva also remained seated with Brahma ji
 shiv ko apana jamata arthath putr samaan hone ke kaaran unke dwaara khadey hokar aadar nahin diye jane se daksh ne apana apmaan mahasoos kiya or unhone shiv ke prati katuctiyon kaa prayog karte hue ab se unhen yajna main devataaon ke saath bhaag na milane kaa shaap de diya
 Thus both of them became psychotic
 ukt ghatana ke baad prajapati daksh ne apni rajdhani kankhal main ek viraat yajna kaa aayojan kiya, jisamen unhone apane jamata shiv or putree sati ko yajna main aane hetu nimantrit nahin kiya
 Even after Shankar ji's explanation, Sati went without calling her father's yagna
 yajyasthal main daksh prajapati ne sati or shankar ji kaa ghor niraadar kiya
 Unable to bear the insult Sati immediately consumed herself with Yogagni in the sacrificial fire
 sati kii mrityu kaa samachar paakar bhagavan shankar ne virbhadra ko utpann kar uske dwaara us yajna kaa vidhwans kara diya
 Virbhadra also beheaded the head of Daksha Prajapati while giving appropriate punishment to the gods and sages who were opposing and ridiculing Lord Shiva
 baad main brahma ji ke dwaara prarthana kiye jane par bhagavan shankar ne daksh prajapati ko uske sir ke badale main bakre kaa sir pradaan kar uske yajna ko sampann karavaaya
 There are clearly three stages in the development of the story of daksha-yajna-demolition
 is katha ke pratham charan kaa rup mahabharat ke shantiparv main he
 This primary form of the story also supports Daksha's sacrifice performed in Kankhal
 yahan kankhal main yajna hone kaa spasht ullekh to nahin he, parantu gangadwar ke desh main yajna hona ullikhit he or kankhal gangadwar ke antargat hi aata he
 In this story, Yajna of Daksha is destroyed but Sati is not consumed
 vastutah sati kailash par apane pati bhagwaan shankar ke paas hi rahati he or apane pita daksh dwaara unhen nimantran tathaa yajna main bhaag nahin diye jane par atyadhik vyakul rahati he
 Due to his distraction, Shiva generates Veerabhadra from his mouth and he goes with the ganas to destroy the yagna
 parantu, na to virbhadra daksh kaa sir katata he or na hi use bhasma karata he
 Naturally, there is no question of adding a goat's head
 vastutah is katha main 'yajna' kaa sir kaatane arthath puri tarah 'yajna' ko nasht kar dene kii baat kahi gayi he, jise baad kii kathaon main 'daksh' kaa sir kaatane se jod diya gaya
 In this legend Daksha praises Shiva by 1008 names and Lord Shiva is pleased and gives him a boon
 is katha ke vikaas ke duusare charan kaa rup shrimadbhagwat mahapurana se lekar shiv puraana tak main varnit he
 In this, Sati stubbornly indulges in Yajna and gets angry and is consumed by Yogagni
 swaabhaavik he ki jab sati yogagni main bhasma ho jaati he to unki laash kahaan se bachegi ! isliye unki laash lekar shivaji ke bhatakane aadi kaa prashn hi nahin uthta he
 No such indication is found at this stage of the narrative
 is katha main virbhadra shivaji kii jataa se utpann hota he tathaa daksh kaa sir kaat kar jala detaa he
 As a result, the head of the goat is added to it
