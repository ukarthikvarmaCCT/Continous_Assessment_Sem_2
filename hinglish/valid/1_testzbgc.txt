 parsiyon ke itihaas main apni daansheeltaa or prabuddhata ke liye prasiddh "kaimaas' bandhuon ne dadabhai ko apane vyapaar main bhagidaar banane ke liye aamantrit kiya
 Accordingly Dadabhai went to England to establish his office in London and Liverpool
 vidhyalay ke vaataavaran ko chhodkar ekaek vyapaaree dhan janaa ek prakaar kii avnati yaa apwatan samajha ja saktaa he, parantu dada bhai ne is avasar ko england main ucch shiksha ke liye janevaale vidhyaarthiyon kii bhalaai ke liye upyukt samajha
 At the same time, his second objective was to launch a movement for greater Indianisation of government administrative institutions
 jo vidhyaarthee un dinon unke sampark main aae or unase prabhavit hue unamem suprasiddh ferojshah mehta, mohandas karmchand gandhi or mohammad ali jina kaa naam ullekhneey he
 Apart from this, another objective of Dadabhai was also to make the British public aware of the grief of the oppressed Indians from British rule and draw attention to their responsibility to remove them
 un dinon bhartiya civil sevaaon main sammilit hone ke icchhuk abhyarthiyon ke liye sabase kathinaayee kii baat yah thi ki unhen pratikul paristhitiyon main british abhyarthiyon se spardhaa kerani padati thi
 To overcome this inconvenience, Dada Bhai's suggestion was to conduct a civil service examination in England and India simultaneously
 iske liye unhone 1893 tak andolan chalaaya jab ki unhone vahaan loksabhaa main us sadan ke ek sadsy kii haisiyat se adhik sangharsh kiya or sabha ne bharat tathaa england main ek saath pariksha chalaane kaa prastaav sweekaar kar liya
 Other than that in those days, even more serious was the terrible impoverishment of Indians
 haalaanki dadabhai hi pehle vyakti nahin the jinhone iske liye dukh kii abhivyakti kii ho kintu ve pehle vyakti avashya the jinhone uske unmoolan ke liye andolan chalaaya
 He proved with facts and figures that while the Indians were engrossed in poverty, India's administrative service was the most expensive in the world
 sarkari aankade un dinon nahin ke samaan the or jaankaree praapt karne ke liye koi gaiyr sarkari saadhan bhi nahin tha
 After the preliminary survey on the economic condition of Indians, it was concluded that the average annual income of a person in the country was twenty rupees in total
 inhen sab aankadon ke aadhaar par east india association ke saamne unhone "wants and meens aav india' naamak niabandh 27 july 1870 ko padhaa
 By the end of the 19th century, Dadabhai advocated not only before many committees and commissions, but also in front of the British Parliament, to remove the evils committed towards India and keep warning the higher officials equally that if India’s moral and material As the decadence continues, Indians will be forced to boycott not only British goods but also British rule, Ntu it had no effect

 There was no week in which he did not have letters from India and clippings of leaflets in relation to Congress and his letters should not reach the Indian friends
 kisi ne kabhi yah apeksha nahin kii thi ki dadabhai house aav kamans main itani badi halchal paidaa kar denge kintu us sadan main unki gatividhi or sakriyata se aisa prathit hota tha maano ve vahaan kii karypranali aadi se bahut pehle se hi parichit rahe hon
 His speeches were heard with great respect and attention about India's poverty, currency and exchange, the consequences arising from the promotion of opium or alcohol consumption
 apane lambey jivan main dadabhai ne desh kii seva ke liye jo bahut se kaary kiye un sabakaa varnan karnaa sthanbhav ke kaaran yahan sambhav nahin he kintu swashaasan ke liye akhil bhartiya congress ke kalakatta adhiveshan main unke dwaara kii gai maang kii charchaa karnaa aavashyak he
 He gave Swarajya the main position in his speech
 apane bhaashan ke dauraan main unhone kaha, ham koi krupa kii yachana nahin kar rahe hai, hamen to keval nyaay chahie
 In the course of my efforts from the beginning, i have had so many failures that were enough to make a person not only disappointed but also rebellious, but i have not been disappointed and i believe that within a short period of time, when As long as i am alive, a constitution which fulfills the demand for good governance, full of goodwill, truth and honor, will be accepted for India
 unki yah aashaa us samay puri hui jab ve saarvajanik jivan se avkaash grahan kar chuke the
 Congress workers and their friends in the East and West were busy preparing proposals to materialize the constitutional reforms as per the hopes of the new generation of India
 parantu 20 agast 1917 kii ghoshnaa ke do maheene purv dadabhai kii mrityu ho chuki thi
 This declaration paved the way for greater Indian cooperation in administrative services and the development of responsible governance in India under the British Empire respectively

 kshatriya, , kshatra, rajanya - ye chaaron shabd saamanytah hindu samaaj ke dwitiya varna or jati ke arth main vyavahrut hote hai kintu visisth aitihaasik athwa saamaajik prasang main paripashwon se sambandh hone ke kaaran inke apane vishesh arth or dhvaniyaan hai
 The meaning of 'kshetra' was originally 'semen' or 'perforation power'
 kintu baad main yah shabd us varg ko abhihit karne laga jo shastrastron ke dwaara anya varnon kaa parirakshan karata tha
 In the Vedas and Brahmins, the word Kshatriya is used in the sense of Rajvarga, the Jatakas and Ramayana, Mahabharata, the feudal class and many warring people have been captivated by the word Kshatriya
 sanskrit shabd "kshas dasyon ho puraa kshatriya, vaisya va shudra naamak chaar virgon main vibhakt tha
 Some warlike tribes such as Kirat, Dravidu, Gurjar Aabhira, Sabar, Malav, Sivi, Trigartha, Yudhyaya, Khas and Tangan etc
, were scheduled under the Kshatriya class in the memories
 paaramparik rup se shaasha va sainik kshatriya varg kaa hissaa hote the, jinka kaary yuddh kaal main samaaj kii raksha hetu yuddh karnaa va shanti kaal main sushasan pradaan karnaa tha
 The Gujjar Pratihara dynasty kept India from the Arab Humo for 300 years, in the Pali language "khatriya" is synonymous with the word Kshatriya

 kabeeley ke jan va pashudhan kii raksha karnaa rajan kaa kartavya tha
 Rajpurohit used to be an associate of Rajan
 praarambhik daur main alag se koi sena nahin hoti thi parantu kalantar main shaasha va sainikon ke ek pruthak varg kaa udai hua
 At that time there was no system of division among the four varnas of the society
 rugveda ke "purushasukt" main chaar varnon ke puranic itihaas kaa varnan he
 Some scholars consider Purusukta to be illuminated in the Rigveda, which is based more on new arguments than on the basic structure of Vedic literature
 chunki vaidic samaaj ke varnon main sabhi bhartiya jatiyon kaa ullekh nahin he arthath purush sookt ko vanshanugat jati vyavastha kii vakaalat hetu likhaa gaya tha
 The alternative explanation is that apart from Purusukta, the word "shudra" has not been used anywhere else in the Rigveda, so some scholars believe that Purusha Sukta was a combination of the post-rigvedic period, which was an oppressive and exploitative class structure
 Was written to denote and legitimize its existence already
 haalanki, purushasukt main "kshatriya" shabd prayukt nahin hua he, "rajan" shabd hua he, phir bhi vaidic granthawali main yah pehla avasar mana jaataa he jahaan samaaj ke chaaron varna ek samay main va ek saath prayukt huye hai
 The use of the word "rajanya" is presumed to have been used for the king's relations at that time, even though it was established as a distinct section of society
 vaidic kaal ke antim charnon "rajanya" shabd ko "kshatriya" shabd se pratisthapit kar diya gaya, jahaan "rajanya" shabd raja se sambandh hona ingit karata he tathaa "kshatriya" shabd kisi vishesh kshetra par shakti prabhaav yaa niyantran ko
 The word "rajanya" prominently refers to the dominant place under the same lineage while the word "kshatriya" refers to the rule or ruler
 jaisawal kaa tark he ki rugveda main "brahman" shabd bhi durlabh prathit hota he, yah sirf "purushasukt" main hi aayaa he tathaa sambhawatah purohit varg vishesh ke liye nahin prayukt hua he
 On the basis of Panini, Patanjali, Katyayan and Mahabharata, Jaiswal believes that the political class was addressed by the name Rajjani and that Rajajnya was a democratically elected ruler
 loktantrik prakriya se chune huye shaasha jaise ki andhak va vrishni ityadi is sandarbh main udhaaharan maane jate hai
 Ram Sharan Sharma shows how after growing polarization between "rajanya" and "vis", a common head was selected by the various dynasty heads which resulted in differentiation of separate classes like ruling class on one side and "vis" on the other
 Has been done kshatriya shabd kaa udgam "kshatra" se he jiskaa arth loukik praadhikaran or shakti he, iskaa sambandh yuddh main safal netaa se kam tathaa ek kshetra par samprabhutaa kaa daawa karne kii moort shakti par adhik he
 It is a symbol of ownership on the land of the genetic clan
 brahman kaal main kshatriyon kii saamaajik sthiti par matbhed he
 According to "panchvinsh Brahmin", Rajyana has the highest position and Brahmins and Vaishyas are below it
 "shatapath brahman 13

11" ke anusaar rajanya, brahman va vaisya ke baad duusare kram par aate hai
 The Varna sequence in Shatapatha Brahmin is - Brahmin, Vaishya, Rajani and Shudra
 vartmaan brahmanvaadi parampara kaa kram - brahman, kshatriya, vaisya va shudra, dharamshastra kaal ke baad sthir ho gaya
 In the Buddhist period, Kshatriyas were often considered to be excellent classes
 hindu samaaj main brahman va kshatriya ke bich pradhanta ko lekar hameshaa se pratidwand rahaa he, parantu rajput samaaj ko hi ucchtam varna kii manyata praapt he

 This is the first time in the history of Indian film, when a new language has been created for a film
 bharat ke pracheen samrajyon main se ek mahishmati, kii rani shivagaamee, ek vishaal jalprapaat ke nikat kii maand se ek shishu ko god liye baahar aati he
 She boldly kills the soldiers in her pursuit and sacrifices her own life to protect the baby
 ain samay par, sthaneey gramin pani main dubi rani kii upar uthi baanh main shishu ko dekh lete hai or us bachche ko surakshit bachaa lete hai
 In this way the queen merges by drowning in the falling waterfall from the height of the mountain
 sanga evam uske pati us shishu kaa naam shiva rakhte hai or apane balak samaan hi parvarish karte hai
 As time passes, Shiva grows up to be a powerful young man who aspires to climb mountains and tries unsuccessfully at times
 ek roj use jalprapaat main behate hue kisi yuvati kaa mukhauta miltaa he
 Desiring to find the identity of the young woman, he attempts a mountain climb again and eventually succeeds
 jalprapaat ke shikhar par, shiva us mukhute kii maalik avanatika ko khoj nikaalata he, ek vidrohi yoddha jiskaa dal gorilla paddati ke jariye mahishmati samrajya ke raja bhallaal dev / pallavathevan ke viruddh yuddh lard rahaa he
 The goal of the party is to rescue the former queen Devasena, who has been confined in the palace for the last 25 years in the palace
 or yah mahatvapurn jimmevary avanatika ko saunpa gaya he
 Avanatika loves to hear Shiva saying that he has come only for her while climbing all the difficulties of this waterfall
 shiva ab is abhiyaan ko apane jimme lene vachan detaa he or chhipate-chhupate hue mahishmati main pravesh kar devsena ko kaid se mukt karaata he
 Shiva redeems him and escapes with him, but soon the king's royal slave Kattappa, who is known for his excellent battle skills, follows him
 magar ghaat lagaae bhadraa, bhallaal dev kaa putr, achaanak hi shiva ke sar par waar karata he, magar katappa apane shastr gira detaa he jab use maaloom hota he ki shiva asal main mahendra bahubali he, divangat raja amrendra bahubali kaa putr
 Then here the past events of King Amarendra Baahubali which happened in the past are mentioned
 amrendra kii mata kii mrityu uske janm pashchaat hota he, jabaki pita usase kaaphi purv hi guzar chuke hote hai
 Sivagami, with the support of his bodyguard Katappa, takes over the reins of the empire until the new king is elected
 vah amrendra bahubali tathaa bhallaal dev ko samaan rup se parvarish detii he, unhen kala, vigyaan, chal-vidya, raajnneeti or yuddh kala jaise kai vidyaon evam prashikshan main paarangat kiya jaataa he, magar donon main hi samrajya ke shashan kii abhilaashaa bhinn rahati he
 While Amarendra treats Bahubali moderately towards the people, Bhallal Dev is extremely tough and takes every possible ruthlessness to achieve his goal, even he kills Bahubali
 jab mahishmati ko shatru kalaakeyas dwaara yuddh kii chunauti milti he, shivagaamee vachan detii he ki jo koi bhi kalaakeyas ke raja kaa sir katkar laaegaa use nayaa raja bana diya jayega or is tarah donon natinon ke bich barabari se yuddh sadhano kaa bantwaare kaa aadesh diya jaataa he
 But Bhallal Dev's handicapped father, Bijjala Deva, provides more and more fighting tools to Bhallal by deceit

 pichley dashak ke dauraan, vaishvikaran, outsorcing or soochna praudyogiki ne bahut saare sanghathanon jaise del or hevlett packard ko sakasham banaaya, taaki ve safaltaapurvak thos sahyogi aapurti network chalaa saken or jiske tahat harek vishesh vyapaar bhagidaar keval kuch pramukh ranneetik gatividhiyon par dhyaan kendrit kar vyapaar parichaalit kare 
 is antar-sanghathanaatmak aapurti network ko ek nae tarah ke sanghathan ke rup main sweekaar kiya ja saktaa he
 However, with the complex relationships of the players in the region, the network structure is neither employed between the "market" nor the 'hierarchy' categories
 It is not clear what kind of performance impact different supply network structures can have on companies and there is little information about coordination terms and non-trade between sector players
 ek vyavastha ke nazariye se dekha jaae to ek jatil network sanrachana vyaktigat ghatak companiyon main vighatit ho sakati he 
 paramparaagat rup se, companiyaan kshetra ke anya alag-alag khilaadiyon ke aantarik prabandhan ko lekar chintaa kiye bina nivesh or utpaada kii prakriyaaon par aapurti network main ekagrachit hoti hai
 Therefore, the selection of an internal management control structure is known as the effect on local concrete performance
 21 veen sadi main, vyapaarik maahaul main parivartan ne aapurti shrunkhlaa network ke vikaas main yogadan kiya he
 First, the consequences of globalization and the transmissions of multinationals, joint ventures, strategic alliances and business partnerships became known as critical success factors, complementing earlier "on-time", "lean manufacturing" and "fast manufacturing" practices

 In general, such a structure can be defined as "a group of semi-independent organizations, all with their own capabilities, to achieve one or more markets to achieve the group's specific business goal
" For the purpose of providing our service, we are supported by constantly changing business groups "
 aapurti shrunkhlaa ke liye suraksha prabandhan pranali main varnit ISO / IEC 28000 or ISO / IEC 28001 or sambandhit maanak ISO or IEC dwaara sanyukt rup se prakashit kiya gaya he
 Six major activities can be seen in the study of supply chain management development: creation, integration and globalization, specialization phase one and two and SCM 2

 nirmaan yug The term supply chain management was first suggested by an American industry consultant in the early 1980s
 haalanki, 20 veen sadi ke shuruyaat main, vishesh rup se samanukram kii rachana ke saath prabandhan main aapurti shrunkhlaa kii avadharana kaa kaaphi lambey samay se mahatv tha
 Supply chain management is the hallmark of this era, including the need for large-scale change, re-engineering, cost reduction programs, and a broad focus on the Japanese way of management
 2
 samanvay yug This era of supply chain management studies highlighted the development of electronic data interchange systems in the 1960s and was developed through enterprise resource planning systems in the 1990s
 internet aadhaarit sahyogi pranali ke vistaar ke saath yah yug 21veen sadi main vikaas ko barkaraar rakhata he
 This era of supply chain development has been characterized by both increasing value addition and cost reduction through integration
 3
 vaishvikaran yug The third activity of supply chain management development, characterized by a focus on supplier relationships in the global system and the expansion of the supply chain across national boundaries and other continents, can be characterized by the globalization era
 haalanki sanghathanon kii aapurti shrunkhlaa main vaishvik sroton ke upyog kaa peechha kai dashakon tak kiya ja saktaa he, aisa 1980 ke dashak tak nahin tha ki kaaphi sankhya main sanghathanon ne vaishvik strot ko apane mukhya kaarobaar main ekikrut karnaa shuru kar diya ho

 Expertise era - Phase I: outsourced manufacturing and distribution 1990 ke dashak main udyogon ne "mul dakshataon" par dhyaan kendrit karnaa shuru kiya or ek visheshgyata model ko apanaaya
 companiyon ne lamberup ekikaran kaa parityag kar diya, non-kor abhiyaan ko saste main bech diya or un kaaryon ke liye bahari anya companiyon ko theka diya
 isse company kii seemaa ke paar kii aapurti shrunkhlaa kaa vistaar or vishesh aapurti shrunkhlaa prabandhan main bhagidaari ke vitaran dwaara prabandhan kii aavashyaktaaon main badlaav aayaa
 This transaction re-centered the fundamental approach of every respective organization
 oems brands ke maalik ban gaye jinhen unki aapurti ke aadhaar main gahari drishyata kii zarurat padi

 prayek apni anuthi visheshtaon or maang ke saath die gaye bazaar, kshetra, yaa channel ke anusaar vyapaarik saajhedaari ke vaataavaran ke prasaran ke nattejey ke aadhaar par saajhedaaron ke jatthe main badlaav ho saktaa he

 Expertise Era - Phase Two: Supply Chain Management as a Service parivahan dallali, godaam prabandhan or gaiyr parisampatti aadhaarit vaahak ke sutarapaat ke saath aapurti shrunkhlaa main visheshgyata 1980 ke dashak main shuru hui or parivahan evam prachaalan tantra kii aapurti yojana, sahyog, nishpaadan or pradarshan prabandhan jaise pahaluon se aage nikal kar yah paripakv hui
 At any given time, market forces can demand change from any number of these expert participants as suppliers, operating system providers, locations and customers, and as components of a supply chain network
 yah parivartanshiltaa vyapaarik saajheedaaron ke bich prakriyaaon ke vinyas or kaary kii aavak samet jatil zaruuraton jo ki network prabandhan ke liye apane aapmen aavashyak hai, electronic sanchaar ke sansthapana str kii sthapana or prabandhan aapurti shrunkhlaa ke aadharbhoot dhaanche main mahatvapurn prabhaav daalati he
 Supply chain expertise enables companies to improve their efficiency overall, as do external sources of contract manufacturing and distribution; This allows them to focus on their core competencies and in mobilizing a network of specialties, best-in-class partners to contribute to its value chain; Thereby increasing their overall performance and efficiency
 The ability to rapidly acquire and expand sector-specific supply chain expertise without developing and maintaining a completely unique and complex capability in the company is the main reason why supply chain expertise is gaining so much popularity
 aapurti shrunkhlaa samaadhaan ke liye outsource takanic sanchaalan kii shuruyaat 1990 ke dashak ke antim charan main hui or mukhya rup se parivahan tathaa sahyog shreniyon main isane apana jad jamaa liya he

0 aapurti shrunkhlaa sanchaalan main isi bhav ke saath chalata he
 This trail of combining SCM results, processes, practices, equipment and delivery options, and increasing the speed of the supply chain will impact global competition, rapid price fluctuations, rising oil prices, low product durability, expertise k expansion guides off-shoring and shortages of talent to guide companies to reach results as quickly as possible

0 pramanit samaadhaan dizine kaa phayda uthaati he
 This is achieved through this qualification network built with the best kind of supply chain domain expertise, which makes it possible to understand which elements are operational and organizationally important that can produce results and also makes sense
 That is how to govern such elements to get desired results through close interaction
 Finally, solutions have been offered as various options such as not contacting through business process outsourcing, keeping a few connections through a systematic service and software edge a service, and high connectivity to traditional software deployment models
 safal SCM ke liye mukhya aapurti shrunkhlaa prakriyaaon main vyaktigat kaaryon ke prabandhan se ekikrut gatividhiyon main ek badlaav kii aavashyaktaa he
 An example scenario: The purchasing department can place an order when requirements are detected
 graahakon kii maang ke anuroop vipanan vibhaag is maang ko puraa karne kii koshish ke tahat vibhinn vitarakon or khudara vikritaon ke saath sampark karata he
 Only through process integration can the information be distributed between the supply chain partners as a whole
 aapurti shrunkhlaa vyavsaay prakriya kaa ekikaran kharidaar or aapurtikartaaon, sanyukt utpaada vikaas, saamaanya pranaaliyon or saajhe soochna ke bich sahyogaatmak kaary se judaa he
 According to Lumbert and Cooper, integrated supply chain operations require a continuous flow of information
 haalanki, prabandhan is nishkarsh par pahunchataa he ki bahut sari companiyon main, utpaada pravaah ke anukulan ko vyapaar ke liye prakriya drushtikon ko lagu kiye bagaiyr puraa nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The main points of supply chain processes stated by Lambert are as follows: maang prabandhan ke bare main bahut kuch likhaa gaya he
 Best-in-class companies have similar characteristics, which are as follows: a) internal and external collaboration) deadline reduction initiatives) strong feedback from customer and market demand d) customer level forecasting aapurti vyavsaay prakriyaaon kii anya mul samalochanaon ke suzav main lambert dwaara kahi gai prakriyaaon ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he, ve is prakaar hai: Customer relationship management is concerned with the maintenance of the relationship between the organization and its customers
 graahak seva, graahak ke bare main jaankaree kaa strot he
 It provides information to the customer at the right time, along with a time table with an interface from the company's production and distribution operations
 graahak sambandh banane ke liye safal sanghathan nimnlikhit kadam uthaate hai: Strategic plans are drawn up with suppliers to support the management of manufacturing flows and the development of new products
 fermon main, jahaan parichaalan kaa vishwavyaapee vistaar hota he, outsorcing kaa saarvbhaumik aadhaar par prabandhan kiya janaa chahie
 icchit parinaam achche sambandh kii ore ishaara karte hai, jahaan donon pakshon ko laabh hota he or dizine-chakra or utpaada-vikaas ke liye samay main kami kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In addition, electronic data develops communication systems such as Internet chaining to speed up interchange and potential needs
 sansaadhan niyojan, aapurti strot, samjhauta, aadesh niyojan, antargami parivahan, bhandaaran, sambhaal or gunvattta ke aashwaasan, jinamein se kai samay ke maamalon par aapurtikartaaon ke saath samanvay kii jimmedaari, aapurti kii nirantarata, suraksha vyavastha or nae sroton yaa kaaryakramon main anusandhan shaamil hai, se jude bahari aapurtikartaaon se utpaadon or saamagree praapt karne se sambandhit gatividhiyaan shaamil hai
 Here, consumers and suppliers need to be integrated into the product-development process to reduce time to market
 utpaada kaa jivan chakra chota hota he, isliye pratispardhaa main bane rahane ke liye kam se kam samay main upyukt utpaadon ko viksit karnaa or safaltaapurvak bazaar main utaara janaa zaruri he
 According to Lumbert and Cooper, managers of the process of product development and commercialization must do the following: vinirmaan prakriya vitaran, channelon ko pichley purvanumaan ke aadhaar par utpaadan or utpaadon kii aapurti karata he
 Manufacturing processes need to be flexible to market changes and mass customization must be adjusted
 Customer demands are met at just-in-time ie minimum consignment sizes at the right time
 iske alaava, vinirmaan pravaah prakriya main badlaav samay chakra ko kam karne kaa arth graahakon kii maang ko puraa karne main anukriyasheeltaa or dakshata main sudhaar he
 Activities such as storage process work, handling, transportation and maximum flexibility of phased time in geographical coordination of components and goods in construction sites and postponement of final combination in the operation of physical distribution are related to planning, scheduling and supporting construction operations 
 yah taiyaar utpaada / graahakon ko seva pradaan karne se sambandhit he
 In physical distribution, customer marketing is the channel's ultimate goal and product / service availability is an important part of every partner channel's marketing effort
 bhautik vitaran prakriya ke madhyam se bhi graahak seva kaa samay or sthaan vipanan kaa abhinn hissaa ban gaya jisase yah kisi vipanan channel ko apane graahakon ke saath jodta he
 It is not just the outsourcing of the purchase of materials and equipment, but it is also the outsourcing of services which are traditionally provided in-house ie inside a company
 is chalan kaa tark yah he ki mulya shrunkhlaa main company un gatividhiyon par dhyaan adhik degi jahaan ise khaas laabh ho or vah baaki sab kuch outsource karegi
 prachaalan tantra main is tarah kii gatividhi vishesh rup se spasht he, jahaan parivahan, bhandaaran or maal niyantran kaa praavdhaan kaa upatheka badi sankhya main visheshgyon yaa prachaalan tantra bhagidaaron ko de diya jaataa he
 Furthermore, the management and control of this network of partners and suppliers requires a good combination of central and local linkages
 isliye, aapurtikarta ke pradarshan kii nigaraanee or niyantran ke saath ranneetik faisle kendriya rup se lene kii zarurat he or sthaneey str par prachaalan tantra bhagidaaron ke saath dainik sampark, sarvshereshth prabandhan hoga
 Experts found a strong connection between marketing share and profit in the integration of supplier and customers in the largest segment
 company ke pradarshan ke saath aapurtikarta kshamtaaon kaa laabh uthaate hue or graahak sambandhon main ek lambii avadhi ke aapurti shrunkhlaa drushtikon par bal dete hue donon ko hi company yaa form ke pradarshan ke saath joda ja saktaa he
 As the efficiency of the operating system becomes an important factor in creating and maintaining competitive advantage, the estimation of the operating system becomes important day by day as the gap between profit and non-profit operations becomes more narrow

 kerane kansaltents ne kaha ki vyapak pradarshan ke akalan main lagi companiyon ne kul utpaadakta main sudhaar mahasoos kiya
 According to experts, internal measures are usually collected and analyzed by the company, including: graahak ke anubhav jaise upayon or nirdesh chihnon kii "sarvshereshth parampara" ke zarie bahari pradarshan kaa akalan kiya jaataa he or isamen 1) graahak ke anubhav kaa akalan or 2) nirdesh chihnon kii sarvshereshth parampara ko shaamil kiya jaataa hai
 The following are the components of supply chain management 1

 Adaptation is samay aapurti shrunkhlaa prabandhan adhyayan par uplabdh samagriyon main ek kami he: vahaan aapurti shrunkhlaa prabandhan ke astitv or simaaon kii vyakhya ke liye kisi tarah kaa saidhantik aadhaar nahin he
 Some authors such as Halldorson and others
, Ketchen and Hult and Lavassany, et al
 Has tried to provide a theoretical foundation by applying organizational principles to various areas related to chain supply
 in siddhanton main nimnlikhit shaamil hai: Supply chain continuity is a business issue affecting supply chain companies or operating systems networks and is often quantified by comparing SECH ratings
 SECH reating saamaajik, naitik, saanskrithik or swasthya ke padchihnon ke rup main paribhaashit kii jaati he
 Consumers have become more aware of the impact of their shopping environment and companies with ngos toward SECH ratings, systematically, organic process-raised foods, factory anti-labor codes and locally manufactured food items Are setting the agenda for change that supports independent and small business
 kyonki aapurti shrunkhlaa aksar 75% se adhik companiyon ke carbon padchihn kaa lekha-jokha karti he, isliye kai sanghathan rasta talash rahe hai ki kis tarah ise kam kiya jaae taaki unke SECH darje main sudhaar ho sake
 Management components of SCM SCM ghatak, chaar-vargeey sanchaalan ruparekha kaa teesraa tatv hai
 The link between the integration level and the management of the business process is the link between the number and level of work associated with the components in the least order
 
 natijatan, prabandhan ghatakon main or jodne yaa prayek ghatak ke str main vruddhi vyapaar prakriya kadi ke ekikaran ke str ko badha sakate hai
 Material written on business process re-engineering, customer-supplier relationships, and SCM recommend various potential components that must attract managerial attention when managing supply relationships
 lambert or kupar ne nimnlikhit ghatakon kii pahchaan kii he: However, a careful examination of current content will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of what key components of supply chain components should be and the "branches" of previously identified supply chain business processes, that is, suppliers and customers
 An understanding will also be made about what kind of relationships can be associated with the components
 Bowersox and Klaus have stated that the emphasis on cooperation, which represents synergism, leads to the highest level of joint achievement
 ek praathmik str channel bhagidaar ek vyavsaay he jo maal ke swaamitv jimmedaari main bhaag lene yaa vittiya jokhim ke anya pahaluon ko maan lene ko taiyaar hota he, is tareeke se isamen praathmik str ghatak shaamil ho jate hai
 
 a secondary level partner is a business that participates in channel relationships by providing essential services to primary participants
 isamen gaun str ke ghatak bhi shaamil hai, jo praathmik pratibhaagiyon kii sahaayta karte hai
 Third-level channel participants and components support primary-level channel participants and may also include the fundamental branches of secondary-level components
 natijatan, lambert or kupar kii aapurti shrunkhlaa ghatakon kii ruparekha kisi nishkarsh par nahin le jaati ki aapurti shrunkhlaa ghatakon ke praathmik yaa gaun str kya hai 
 vah he, koun-se aapurti shrunkhlaa ghatakon ko praathmik yaa gaun ke rup main dekha janaa chahie, in aapurti shrunkhlaa kii sanrachana ko or adhik vyapak banane ke liye in ghatakon ko kaise taiyaar kiya jaae or ekikrut rup main aapurti shrunkhlaa ko kaise jaancha jaae 
 Reverse supply chain Reverse operating system is the process of return management of goods
 vipareet prachaalan tantra ko "vikray ke pashchaat di janivali graahak sevaaon" ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 In other words, at any time the amount taken from the company's warranty reserve or service operating system budget can be called a reverse operating system operation
 vaishvik aapurti shrunkhlaa maatra or mulya donon ke sambandh main chunauti detii he : Supply and value chain trends nirmaataaon ke liye in pravritiyon ke bahut saare laabh hai, kyonki ve apane utpaadon kii khepon ke bade aakaar bana sakate hai, kam karon or behatar vaataavaran ko sambhav bana sakate hai
 Meanwhile, the identification of problems in supply chain management has become paramount, with the scope of the supply chain going global, and many more challenges to be faced
 This is because with the expansion of the supply chain, it also has a much longer time frame
 iske alaava bahu mudraaen, vibhinn nitiyaan or vibhinn kanoon jaise bahut saare mudde shaamil hai
 The following are the successive problems: 1
 Valuation of them in different currencies and different countries, 2

 Outlining the limits of revivalism, he wrote in one of his articles that- There is nothing exuberant and extravagant in Ranade
 He refused to reap cheap notoriety by playing the part of an extremist
 He refused to mislead people by playing upon and exploiting the patriotic sentiments of the people
 He refused to be a party to methods which are crude, which have volume but no effect, and which are neither fool-proof nor knave-proof, and which break the back even of the most earnest and sincere servants of the country and disable them from further effort
 In short, Ranade was like the wise Captain who knows that his duty is not to play with his ship clever and masterful tricks, just for effect and show in the midst of the ocean, but to take it safely to its appointed port
 In short, Ranade was not a forged bank note and in worshipping him we have no feeling of kneeling before anything that is false
