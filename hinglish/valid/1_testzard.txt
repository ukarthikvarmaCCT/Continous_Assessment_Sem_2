 After his stay in Rome from 1513 to 1516, the French king, Francis I, took him to his country and arranged for him to stay in the coat of Ambaz
 yaheen inaki mrityu hui
 The difference between Leonardo and other European Renaissance artists is that Vinci did not spend time primarily copying artifacts of ancient times
 ve swabhaavat: prakruti ke anany adhyeta the
 In his paintings of life, along with the subtle reality of expressive representations, such a combination of live motion and flow of lines is found as is not found in any earlier painter
 ye pehle chitrakaar the, jinhone is baat kaa anubhav kiya ki sansar ke drishyon main prakaash or chaaya kaa vilaas hi sabase adhik prabhaavshaalee tathaa sundar hota he
 So they gave it proper importance along with color and lines

 There is a similar view in relation to some other idols, but certainly nothing can be said

 puraani metric pranali main kai ikaayiyon ke samooh prayog kiye jate the
 SI was developed in 1960 from the old meter-kilogram-second system, rather than the centimeter-gram-second system, which had many difficulties
 SI pranali sthir nahin rahati, varan isamen nirantar vikaas hote rahete hai, parantu ikaiyaan anterrashtriya samjhauton ke dwaara hi banaai or badali jaati hai
 The system is almost universally applicable and most countries do not even understand the official definitions of other units
 parantu iske apwaad sanyukt rajya america or britain hai, jahaan abhi bhi gaiyr-si ikaayiyon unki puraani pranaliyaan lagu hai
 In India, this system came into force on 1 April 1957
 iske saath hi yahaan nayaa paisa bhi lagu hua, jo ki swayan dashamalav pranali par aadhaarit tha
 Many new naming units came into force in this system
 is pranali main saat mul ikaiyaan or anya kai vyutpann ikaiyaan hai
 Other units are also used with the SI system in some scientific and cultural fields
 SI upsargon ke madhyam se bahut choti or bahut badi matraaon ko vyakt karne main saralata hoti he
 The difference between the definition and implementation of an entity is important
 prayek SI mul ikai kii paribhaasha saavdhaanee purvak banaai gai he taaki vah apurv or adwitiya ho or saath saath ek thos saidhantik aadhaar prastut kare jis par aadhaarit sabase parishuddh or punarutpaadaneey maapan kiye ja saken
 The process of implementing a definition of a unit is one in which that definition, like that unit, establishes the value of its quantity and the uncertainty associated with it; Can be used
 kuch mahatvapurn ikaayiyon kii paribhaashaayen kaise karyanvit kii jaati hai, yah BIPM kii websit par diya gaya haiek SI vyutpann ikai adwitiya rup keval SI mul ikaayiyon ke rup main hi paribhaashit hoti he
 For example, the SI derivative unit of electrical resistance, ohms, is uniquely defined by this relation: ω = m2 kg s − 3 a − 2, which is the result of the definition of the amount of electrical resistance
 vaise koi bhi tarika, jo ki bhautikee ke siddhanton / niyamon se saamanjasy rakhata ho, vah kisi bhi SI ikaayiyon ke karyanvayan hetu prayog ho saktaa he
 The metric system was designed by a group of scientists

 To make this group a rational measurement system; Was unified and authorized by the French Emperor Louis XVI
 francisi kranti ke uparaant nai sarkaar dwaara yah pranali angeekrut kar lee gai thi
 a new decimal meter was also adopted by the National Conference on August 1, 1793, and defined a temporary length as well as other decimal units
 7 april, 1795 ko, gramme evam kilogramme ne puraani shabdaawalee "gravet" evam "grev" kaa sthaan liya
 On December 10, 1799, the metric system was permanently adopted in France
 aaj vishwa bhar main prayog ho rahi metric pranali ne kai badlaav dekhe hai
 It has also superseded many traditional systems
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke bahut baad tak kai bhinn maapan pranaliyaan vishwa bhar main prayukt ho raheen thim
 Many of these systems were different from the metric system, while others were based on either the Imperium system or the American system
 tab yah aavashyaktaa siddh hui ki in sab kaa metrikaran hona chaiye, jisase ek vishwavyaapee maapan pranali banaai ja sake
 Consequently, the ninth General Conference on Weights and Measures was held in 1948 in which the International Committee on Weights and Measures was directed to conduct an international study of the measurement requirements of scientific, technological and teaching committees
 is adhyayan ke parinaamon par aadhaarit, dasvin CGPM ne 1954 main yah nirnay kiya ki chah mul ikaayiyon se ek anterrashtriya pranali vyutapann kii jaae, jo ki yantric evam vidyutchumbakeey matraaon kii saath hi taapmaana evam drushti sambandhi vikiranon kaa maapan uplabdh kara paae
 The six original units approved were meters, kilograms, seconds, amperes, degrees, calvin and candela

 The International Standardization Organization or ISO standard ISO 31 contains recommendations by the International Electrotechnical Commission or IEC for use in electrical applications of the international unit system, of which their standard IEC 60027 is also noteworthy
 vah kaary abhi pragati par he jisase kii donon kaa ekikaran kar ek sanyukt maanak ISO / IEC 8 xxrep 4 0 bane, jise matraaon kii anterrashtriya pranali yaa International System of Quantities kaha jaae
 In the international unit system, there is a group of units, with the same group of prefixes
 SI ikaayiyon ko do upasamoohon main baanta ja saktaa he :- These units as well mul ikai ke gunak banane hetu, SI upsarg ko joda ja saktaa he
 All multiples are absolute numbers of ten
 udhaahrantah kilo-= sahasr yaa hajaar mili-= hajaarwaan bhaag yani ek meter main ek hajaar millimetre hote hai, saath hi ek hajaar meter se ek kilo meter banataa he
 Prefixes cannot be mixed
 ek kilogram kaa das lakhwan bhaag he milligram parantu use ek micro-kilogram nahin kahenge
 To establish a relationship between the units used in different systems, the unit is created from the tradition or basic definition of the unit
 ikaayiyon ke bich antaran hetu antaran karkon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 There are several versions of transfer factors, see for example Appendix B, NIST SP 811
 spacific gravity ko praayah SI ikaayiyon main, yaa pani ke sandarbh main darshit kiya jaataa he
 Because a cube whose size is 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, its volume will be 1000 cm3, which is equal to 1 L; And when filled with water, its weight is 1 kg, hence the specific gravity of water is 1 g / cm3 and it will freeze at 0 ° C

 Template: Ark Sikh Sect sikhon kaa pavitra dharmagranth jise unke paanchaven guru arjunadev ne san 1604 i
 main sangruhit karaayaa tha or jise sikh matanuai 'gurugranth sahib ji' bhi kehete evam guruvat maanakar sammanit kiya karte hai
 Under 'adigranth', apart from the first five gurus of Sikhs, there are the statements of their ninth Guru and 14 'bhagats'
 aisa koi sangrah sambhavat: guru nanakdev ke samay se hi taiyaar kiya jane laga tha or guru amardaas ke putr mohan ke yahan pratham chaar guruon ke patradi surakshit bhi rahe, jinhen paanchaven guru ne unase lekar pun: krambaddh kiya tathaa unamem apni ore kuch 'bhagaton' kii bhi baniyaan sammilit karke sabko bhai gurudas dwaara gurumukhi main lipibaddh kara diya
 Brother Bannon then copied the same and mixed the compositions of some other people which were not approved, but also the works of some others, Govind Singh prepared a third 'beed' in which, along with the works of the ninth Guru, himself
 One of his 'saloks' was also ranked
 uskaa yahi rup aaj bhi vartmaan samajha jaataa he
 It is difficult to say only about a few final compositions when and how they were added
 'granth' kii pratham paanch rachanaayen kramash: 'japunisanu', 'sodaru' mahala1, 'sunibada' mahala1, 'so purakhu', mahala 4 tathaa sohila mahala ke naamon se prasiddh hai or inke ananthar 'sirirag' aadi 31 raagon main vibhakt pad aate hai jinamein pehle sikhaguruon kii rachanaayen unke anusaar sangruhit hai
 The positions of the Bhagats have been kept in their interiors, but somewhere in between, 'barhamasa', 'thinti', 'dinraini', 'ghodiyaan', 'siddha Gosthi', 'karhale', 'birhade', 'sukhmani' etc
 Certain small and big specific compositions have also been added, which illustrate the poetic nature of ordinary folk songs
 un raganusaar krambaddh padon ke ananthar salok sahas kriti, 'gaatha' mahala 5, 'phunhe' mahala 5, chaubolen mahala 5, savaie simukh vaak mahala 5 or mudaavni mahala 5 ko sthaan mila he or sabhi ke ant main ek ragamala bhi de di gai he
 Even in the midst of these works, if 'salok' of Kabir and Sheikh Farid is stored, then elsewhere there are those eulogies created by 11 posts which are said to be in praise of Sikh Gurus and whose number is not even less
 'granth' main sangruhit rachanaayen bhashavavidhya ke kaaran kuch vibhinn lagati hui bhi, adhiktar saamanjasy evam ekarupata ke hi udhaaharan prastut karti hai
 Sometimes Adibranth is also called 'gurubani', but in the eyes of its devotees, it is always a physical guru
 at: guru ke samaan use svachh reshmi vastron main veshtit karke chandani ke neeche kisi unchi gaddi par 'padhraya' jaataa he, usapar chanwar dhalate hai, pushpadi chadhaate hai, uski aarti utaarte hai tathaa uske saamne naha dhokar jate or shraddhapurvak pranaam karte hai

 Suitable times for specific small major compositions such as morning, evening, bedtime are certain and although the subjects of major collected works seem to be mainly related to philosophical principles, spiritual practice and praise, there is no doubt that 'etc

 But these were the days of the state revolution in France and it was the result of the ideas of the revolution that though you had made significant improvements in the imposition of rent after being appointed the chief monopoly of the state in 1768, his post on guillotine in 1793 was his life

 It is the most used system in the world in the field of science and commerce
 puraani metric pranali main kai ikaayiyon ke samooh prayog kiye jate the
 SI was developed in 1960 from the old meter-kilogram-second system, rather than the centimeter-gram-second system, which had many difficulties
 SI pranali sthir nahin rahati, varan isamen nirantar vikaas hote rahete hai, parantu ikaiyaan anterrashtriya samjhauton ke dwaara hi banaai or badali jaati hai
 The system is almost universally applicable and most countries do not even understand the official definitions of other units
 parantu iske apwaad sanyukt rajya america or britain hai, jahaan abhi bhi gaiyr-si ikaayiyon unki puraani pranaliyaan lagu hai
 In India, this system came into force on 1 April 1957
 iske saath hi yahaan nayaa paisa bhi lagu hua, jo ki swayan dashamalav pranali par aadhaarit tha
 Many new naming units came into force in this system
 is pranali main saat mul ikaiyaan or anya kai vyutpann ikaiyaan hai
 Other units are also used with the SI system in some scientific and cultural fields
 SI upsargon ke madhyam se bahut choti or bahut badi matraaon ko vyakt karne main saralata hoti he
 The difference between the definition and implementation of an entity is important
 prayek SI mul ikai kii paribhaasha saavdhaanee purvak banaai gai he taaki vah apurv or adwitiya ho or saath saath ek thos saidhantik aadhaar prastut kare jis par aadhaarit sabase parishuddh or punarutpaadaneey maapan kiye ja saken
 The process of implementing a definition of a unit is one in which that definition, like that unit, establishes the value of its quantity and the uncertainty associated with it; Can be used
 kuch mahatvapurn ikaayiyon kii paribhaashaayen kaise karyanvit kii jaati hai, yah BIPM kii websit par diya gaya haiek SI vyutpann ikai adwitiya rup keval SI mul ikaayiyon ke rup main hi paribhaashit hoti he
 For example, the SI derivative unit of electrical resistance, ohms, is uniquely defined by this relation: ω = m2 kg s − 3 a − 2, which is the result of the definition of the amount of electrical resistance
 vaise koi bhi tarika, jo ki bhautikee ke siddhanton / niyamon se saamanjasy rakhata ho, vah kisi bhi SI ikaayiyon ke karyanvayan hetu prayog ho saktaa he
 The metric system was designed by a group of scientists
 inamen antoni loriat lavashie pramukh the, jinhen aadhunik rasayanashastra kaa janak kaha jaataa he
 To make this group a rational measurement system; Was unified and authorized by the French Emperor Louis XVI
 francisi kranti ke uparaant nai sarkaar dwaara yah pranali angeekrut kar lee gai thi
 a new decimal meter was also adopted by the National Conference on August 1, 1793, and defined a temporary length as well as other decimal units
 7 april, 1795 ko, gramme evam kilogramme ne puraani shabdaawalee "gravet" evam "grev" kaa sthaan liya
 On December 10, 1799, the metric system was permanently adopted in France
 aaj vishwa bhar main prayog ho rahi metric pranali ne kai badlaav dekhe hai
 It has also superseded many traditional systems
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke bahut baad tak kai bhinn maapan pranaliyaan vishwa bhar main prayukt ho raheen thim
 Many of these systems were different from the metric system, while others were based on either the Imperium system or the American system
 tab yah aavashyaktaa siddh hui ki in sab kaa metrikaran hona chaiye, jisase ek vishwavyaapee maapan pranali banaai ja sake
 Consequently, the ninth General Conference on Weights and Measures was held in 1948 in which the International Committee on Weights and Measures was directed to conduct an international study of the measurement requirements of scientific, technological and teaching committees
 is adhyayan ke parinaamon par aadhaarit, dasvin CGPM ne 1954 main yah nirnay kiya ki chah mul ikaayiyon se ek anterrashtriya pranali vyutapann kii jaae, jo ki yantric evam vidyutchumbakeey matraaon kii saath hi taapmaana evam drushti sambandhi vikiranon kaa maapan uplabdh kara paae
 The six original units approved were meters, kilograms, seconds, amperes, degrees, calvin and candela
 1960 main, 11wein CGPM ne is pranali kaa namakaran anterrashtriya ikai pranali yaa International System of Units, sankshep main SI jo multah bana he french se: Le Système international d'unités
 saatvin mul ikai, mol yaa the mole, ko 1971 main 14wein CGPM main joda gaya
 The International Standardization Organization or ISO standard ISO 31 contains recommendations by the International Electrotechnical Commission or IEC for use in electrical applications of the international unit system, of which their standard IEC 60027 is also noteworthy
 vah kaary abhi pragati par he jisase kii donon kaa ekikaran kar ek sanyukt maanak ISO / IEC 8 xxrep 4 0 bane, jise matraaon kii anterrashtriya pranali yaa International System of Quantities kaha jaae
 In the international unit system, there is a group of units, with the same group of prefixes
 SI ikaayiyon ko do upasamoohon main baanta ja saktaa he :- These units as well mul ikai ke gunak banane hetu, SI upsarg ko joda ja saktaa he
 All multiples are absolute numbers of ten
 udhaahrantah kilo-= sahasr yaa hajaar mili-= hajaarwaan bhaag yani ek meter main ek hajaar millimetre hote hai, saath hi ek hajaar meter se ek kilo meter banataa he
 Prefixes cannot be mixed
 ek kilogram kaa das lakhwan bhaag he milligram parantu use ek micro-kilogram nahin kahenge
 To establish a relationship between the units used in different systems, the unit is created from the tradition or basic definition of the unit
 ikaayiyon ke bich antaran hetu antaran karkon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 There are several versions of transfer factors, see for example Appendix B, NIST SP 811
 spacific gravity ko praayah SI ikaayiyon main, yaa pani ke sandarbh main darshit kiya jaataa he
 Because a cube whose size is 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, its volume will be 1000 cm3, which is equal to 1 L; And when filled with water, its weight is 1 kg, hence the specific gravity of water is 1 g / cm3 and it will freeze at 0 ° C
 metric pranali ko arth evam dainik vaanijya saadhan ke rup main vishwavyaapee samarthan mila he
 The reason for this was also to a large extent that many countries did not have the ability to explain many principles in conservative systems

 This also encouraged international trade
 vaigyanik drushtikon se dekhen, to isamen atyadhik badi or atisookshm ikaayiyon ko bhi dashamalav ke prayog se bataaya ja saktaa he
 Many units of daily and scientific experimentation are not derived from the seven basic units

 Some examples include: european sangh ne ek nirdesh diya he jo gaiyr-si chinhit saamaan kii bikri ko 31 disambar 2009 ke baad se pratibandhit karata he
 This applies to all products, attached instructions and papers, packing and advertisements
 lekin 11 sitambar 2007 ko, EU ne ghoshit kiya he, ki britain ko is nirdesh se mukt karte hai or unka imparial pranali abhi bhi aniyat roopen maanya hoga, saath saath main metric pranali ke diya ho to

 dharm kaa arth hota he, dhaaran, arthath jise dhaaran kiya ja sake, dharm ,karm pradhan he
 Religion is what reflects virtues
 dharm ko gun bhi kah sakate hai
 It is worth mentioning here that the meaning of virtue in the word religion is not related to human
 padaarth ke liye bhi dharm shabd prayukt hota he yatha pani kaa dharm he bahna, agni kaa dharm he prakaash, ushma dena or sampark main aane vaali vastu ko jalaana
 From the perspective of generality, calling religion a virtue is absolutely appropriate in the sense of both living and non-living
 dharm saarvbhaumik hota he
 Whether there is a substance or a human, sitting in any corner of the whole earth, the religion of a human or a substance is the same
 uske desh, rang rup kii koi baadha nahin he
 Religion is eternal, that is, in every era, the form of religion remains the same
 dharm kabhi badalata nahin he
 For example, the religion of water, fire etc
 is the same from creation to the present day
 dharm or sampradaay main moolbhoot antar he
 The meaning of religion when it is worthy of being in virtue and life should be the same for every human being
 jab padaarth kaa dharm saarvbhaumik he to maanav jati ke liye bhi to isaki saarvbhaumikta honi chahie
 Therefore, in the context of humans, religion is only human religion
 hindu, muslim, isai, jain yaa buddha aadi dharm na hokar sampradaay yaa samudaay maatr hai
 "sampradaya" is a group of believers of a tradition
 bhartiya samskruti or darshan kii pramukh sankalpana he

 saadhaaran shabdon main dharm ke bahut se arth hai jinamein se kuch ye hai- kartavya, ahimsa, nyaay, sadacharan, sad-gun aadi
 Four Purusharths have been accepted in Sanatan Dharma, of which religion is predominant
 teen anya purusharth ye hai- arth, kaam or moksh
 Gautama Rishi says - 'yato Abhyudyanishreyas Siddhi: s Dharma
 ' Manu has given ten characteristics of human religion: jo apane anukool na ho vaisaa vyavhaar duusare ke saath nahin karnaa chaiye - yah dharm kii kasuti he
 The Hindu community following the above human religion is the oldest among all major communities in the world

 ye duniya kaa teesraa sabase bada samudaay he, par iske zyaadaatar log bharat main hai or vishwa kaa sabase adhik hinduon kaa pratishat nepal main he
 Although many deities are worshiped by the people of this community, it is in fact a monotheistic religion
