 After this, he cursed his wife that Ray misbehaver! You have been lying here in the ashes for thousands of years, suffering only by drinking air
 jab ram is van main pravesh karenge tabhi unki krupa se tera uddhaar hoga
 Only then you will be able to come to me after wearing your former body
 yah kah kar gautam rishi is ashram ko chhodkar himalay par jaakar tapasya karne lage

 vartmaan main anek pariwaron kii dawaayein malaria upachaar main prayog kii jaati hai, jinhen samuhik rup se malaria-rodhi davaayen kaha jaataa he
 Many drugs are used only for resistance or treatment only, while others can be used both ways
 kuch davaayen ek-duusare ke prabhaav ko badhaati hai or inkaa prayog saath main kiya jaataa he
 The most prominent factor in the choice of medicine is that malaria parasites have developed resistance to which drugs in that area
 kunain parivaar kii chloroquin malaria ke liye sabase sasti tathaa prabhavi dawa maani jaati rahi he or iskaa prayog varshon tak bahut kiya gaya
 But recently the parasite has become resistant to it, especially P
 falciparum
 aise paraseete kunain tathaa emodiaqueen ke prati bhi pratirodh viksit kar lete hai
 In areas where the parasite is still sensitive to chloroquine, it is used first
 anya dawaaon main primaquin, hydroxichloroquin, paimaaquin or mefloqueen shaamil hai
 Of these, quinine and primaquine are used only in treatment, while chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and mefloquine are used for both treatment and prevention

 How these drugs work is still unclear, although malarial parasites can also gain resistance against them
 is parivaar main shaamil hai artimicinin, artimither, artisunet, artimenol or artimother 
 Other anti-malarial drugs include progavanil and cyclogvanil of the bivuanide group, folate-inhibiting pyrimithamine, and halofantrin and lumifantrin
 inke atirikt atovakvon, doxiciclin or salfadoxin jaisi davaayen anya bimariyon ke ilaaj ke saath-saath malaria ke ilaaj main bhi istemaal hoti hai
 Many of the above mentioned drugs are such that increase the effect of any other medicine and hence they are used only as drug combinations
 inamen se pramukh hai atovakvon-proguanil, artimither-lumigentrin, artisunet-emodiaqueen, salfadoxin-pyrimithamine or artisunet-salfadoxin-parimithamine 
 It has become easier to develop new drugs nowadays, as P

 However, many physicians believe that serious diseases like malaria should be treated with allopathic medicines, as they are based on scientific research

 Even the advice of the British Homeopathic Association is that homeopathy should not be depended on for the treatment of malaria

 The Muslim government in the subcontinent was over and the Muslims of 1857 had lost their independence due to the extreme revenge of the British
 Since the British had taken the government away from the Muslims and in the Gadar, the Muslims were the only ones, so the British persecuted the Muslims
 Millions of Muslims have also been hanged to death by sympathy and they have been executed and their policies have been subscribed
 It was decided that the business of the Muslims began to be destroyed, that the Muslims who used to live a magnificent ishrat life in the big eleven palaces, the same Muslims were forced to live a life in broken small houses, in the British country, by turning on English education, the Muslims gave their children
 Did not want to teach English education because he did not want non Muslim Muslims to train their children other Are that the British had Mkarana thinking the end of the schools bring Broye car Arabic and Persian Turned on English as well as refused to offer the Friday prayers, so the Muslims boycotted English education which did not give them any government job
 In short, Indian Muslim education, social, political and economic collapse On the other hand, the British were all on seal seal and with it there was a thin opposition and Hindu interests on the formation of the party
 For the British ears Dan Hume formed the All India National Congress which, on seeing it, claimed to be a party of both Hindu and Muslim but in reality it was only the representative party of Hinduism which considered themselves as the British and after the British the Indian Man Hindu Hindus wanted to make Hind their slaves by making the rule, then the Muslims moved to Dhaka in 1906 to protect their rights
 Established India Muslim League
 The collapse was developing politically and economically
 On the other hand, the British were all on seal and with it, for the formation of a thin opposition and a party of Hindu interests, the British ear Dan Hume formed the All India National Congress, which was seen as a party of both Hindu Muslims

 The seventh phase of this rite is Laja Home or Bhawren, or Phere
 praayshchit aahuti ke baad lajahome or yagyagni kii parikrama kamila-jula kram chalata he
 For Lajahome, the girl's brother stands behind with a ball in a plate
 ek mutti khil apni bahin ko de
 The girl hands him over to the groom
 var use aahuti mantra ke saath havan kar de
 Thus, it should be done three times
 kanya teenon baar bhai ke dwaara diye hue khil kaapane pati ko de, vah teenon baar havan main aparn kar de
 In Lajahome, the sister gets a meal from her brother's house, she hands it over to her husband
 kahati he beshak mere vyaktigat upyog ke liepita ke ghar se mujhe kuch mila he, par use main chhipaakar alag se nahin rakhti,aapako saunpti hoon
 No one should feel alienation or a sense of concealment, so the way the husband earns something, he hands it over to the wife, in the same way the wife also hands over her achievements to the husband
 pati sochataa he, ham log haath-pair se jo kamaayenge, usee se apana kaam chalaayenge,kisi ke udaartaapurvak diye hue anudaan ko bina shram kiye khaakar kyon hamkisi ke rini bane
 Therefore the husband does not keep that laja for his dinner, but gives home in the yajna
 jan kalyaan ke liye us padaarth ko vayubhoot banakarsansar ke vayumandal main bikher detaa he
 In this action, the great human ideal is embedded here that the goods of free will either not be accepted or if it is found then it should be spent in the public interest
 log apni-apni nij kii paseene kii kamai par hi guzar-basar karen
 The deceased had the same idealism after the banquet that the boys did not take the money received in succession by the father in his work, but spent it in the maintenance of social service Brahmins or in other virtues
 yahi dahej kesambandh main bhi thik he
 The father's house was generously received, so his feelings are heartbreaking, but you too must have some feelings
 muft kaa maal khate hue kisi kamau manushya kaa gairat aana swaabhaavik he
 It is right for him to think that the money without hard work, given even by the generous spirit of charity, will not digest it, so it is appropriate to sacrifice the gift in the work of Jan Mangal, Paramarthyagya
 isi uddeshyse patni ke bhai ke dwaara diye gayi laja ko vah yajna kaary main laga detaahai
 This is the right use of dowry, it is also a practice that a lot of charity is done on behalf of the bride's side on the occasion of marriage
 acha ho jo kuch mili, vah sabko hidaan kar de
 Not only at the time of marriage, but also on other occasions, if anyone ever gets the same hard work gift from someone, then there should be a policy regarding that we will not become indebted to the hereafter by eating free goods, but by applying such grant in charity, that generous tradition Do not stop in yourself and will further increase public welfare

 yah na hokar ulte jab kanya paksh ko dabaa hua samaj kar use tarah-tarah sesatane or chusane kii yojana banaai jaati he, to yahi samajhnaa chahie ki bhartiyaparamparaayen bilkul ulti ho gayin
 Unrighteousness in place of religion, the kingdom of insecurity prevailed in the place of divinity
 lajahome vatarmaan kaal kii kshudra manyataon ko dhikkaarta he or dahej kesambandh main sahi drushtikon apnaane kii prerana detaa he
 Orbiting the husband and wife of Agni
 baayen se daayen kii ore chalem
 In the first four ceremonies, the girl was ahead and the groom was behind
 chaar parikrama ho jane par ladakaaage ho jaae or ladki peeche
 Parikrama mantra should be uttered at the time of circumambulation, and after completion of the parikrama, each person should worship with the bride-groom Gayatri Mantra, this means - the family will lead the girl in family functions, her counseling will be valued, and she will follow, Because the woman has more experience of those works
 baahar ke kaaryon main varanetritv karata he or nari uskaa anusaran karti he, kyonki vyavsayikkshetron main var kaa anubhav adhik hota he
 In which, the direction of which is less, in another, be careful to increase its information and make it equitable
 bhaavana kshetra main nari aage he, karmkshetra main purush
 Both sides are important in their respective positions
 kul milakar nari kaa vacharsv, pad, gaurav evam vajan bada baithta he
 Therefore, he is given the opportunity to do four rounds and the male has three rounds
 gaurav ke chunaav ke 4 vot kanya ko or 3 vot var ko milte hai
 Therefore, the male has always got the first place
 seetaram, radheshyaam, lakshminarayan,umamahesh aadi yugmon main pehle nari kaa naam he, peeche nar kaa
 The mixed order of Laja Home and Parikrama goes on
 shilarohan ke baad var-vadhookhde-khadey gayatri mantra se ek aahuti samarpit karen
 Now do the ritual with mantra
 vadhoo aage, var peeche chalem
 Upon completion of a circumambulation, make a sacrifice of Paralajahome
 aahuti karke duusari parikrama pehle kii tarah mantrabolate hue karen
 Similarly, do Lajahom's second sacrifice and do the third round and the third round should do the fourth round
 iske baad gayatri mantra kiahuti dete hue teen parikramaayen var ko aage karke parikrama mantra bolte huekarai jaaen
 Realize with a sacrifice that the sacrificial energy is being intensified in the sacrificial energy and conscience outside

 The deep history of Dadra and Nagar Haveli begins with the defeat of the Koli chieftains of the region by the invading Rajput kings
 maraathon ne rajputon ko haraa kar 18veen sadi ke madhya main apana shashan sthapit kiya
 After a long struggle between the Marathas and the Portuguese, on 17 December 1779, the Maratha Peshwa Madhava Rao II handed over revenue of Rs 12,000 to the Portuguese to 79 villages of the region to ensure friendship
 janata dwaara 2 agast,1954 ko mukt karaane tak portugaliyon ne is pradesh par shashan kiya
 From 1954 to 1961, the region functioned almost independently, which was run by the 'independent Dadra and Nagar Haveli administration'
 lekin 11 agast 1961 ko yah pradesh bhartiya sangh main shaamil ho gaya or tab se bharat sarkaar ek centreshasit pradesh ke rup main iskaa prashasan kar rahi he
 Since the liberation of the region from the clutches of Portugal, the 'senior Panchayat' was functioning as a consultative body of administration but it was dissolved in 1989 and at the pan-india level in accordance with the Constitution amendment Dadra and Nagar Haveli District Panchayat and a state council of 11 gram panchayats was formed
 bharat kii 1947 main aazaadee ke baad, portugali praanton main sakriy swatantraaa senaanee tathaa dusre sthanon ke based bharatiyon ne goa, daman, diu, daadaraa evam nagar haveli ke mukti kaa vichaar paala
 Mahatma Gandhi had the same ideology even before India became independent and he also affirmed - "goa cannot be allowed to remain as a separate entity in opposition to the laws of the free state that exists
" jab bharat ne 26 janvari 1950 ko ganatantraa hasil kii tab francisi sarkaar ne bharat ke purvi tat par apni kshetreey sampatti khaali karne kaa nirnay liya parantu portugali sarkaar ne tab bhi bharat main apane jad gadaaye rakhe
 As a result, the freedom movement deepened in Goa, Dadra, Nagar Haveli and other areas
 phir lisbon main ek bhartiya duutavas kholaa gaya taaki goa ke hastantaran par charchaa kii ja sake
 But the Portuguese government not only refused to talk about the liberation of Goa, but they already intensified the repressive measures implemented in the enclaves
 1953 me portugali sarkaar se samjhaute ke liye ek or prayaas kiya gaya - is baar unhen ye bhi aashwaasan dilaayaa gaya ki parikshetron kii saanskrithik pahchaan unke sthanantaran ke baad bhi sangrakshit rahegi or kanoonon va reeti rivaajon ko bhi aparivartit rakhaa jaayegaa
 Nevertheless, they continued to hold their stubbornness as before and even refused to respond to the initiatives taken by India
 falswaroop lisbon main stith bhartiya duutavas ko june 1953 main band kar diya gaya
 Appasaheb Karmalkar - a bank employee of the Government of Goa, took over the reins of the National Liberation Movement Organization to liberate the Portuguese-ruled states
 saath hi saath aaazaad gomantak dal, rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke swayamsevak daadaraa or nagar haveli ko mukt karaane ke liye sashastr hamale kii tayyari kar rahe the
 Wakankar and Kajrekar visited Dadra and Nagar Haveli several times in 1953 to study the topography and to introduce them to local activists and leaders who were agitating for the liberation of Portuguese territory

 The next day, on 29 July, the independent village Panchayat of Naroli was established

 Artism An approach to art based on the 'art for art' recognition, which led to widespread debate in Europe during the 19th century
 kalawaad ko sahitya evam kala ke kshetra main upyogetavaad ke vilom ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 This theory was formulated by Victor Couze in 1818
 iske anusaar kala kaa uddeshy kisi naitik yaa dharmik uddeshy kii prapti nahin balki swany apane purnataa kii talash he
 Art is the carrier of aesthetics, so it should not be judged as a test of utility
 samaaj, niti, dharm, darshan aadi ke niyamon kaa paalan kala kii svachhand tathaa swatah sfoort abhivyakti main baadhak hote hai
 According to Artists, artists are extraterrestrial beings, art objects of art and artistic pleasure are supernatural tasteful and social
 iske vipareet upyogetavaadi kala ko na keval samaaj kii manovritiyaan parivartit karke vaanchit disha kii ore agresharit karne kaa shashakt saadhan maanate hai, apitu use siddhant prachaar kaa sarvottam madhyam bhi bataate hai
 Utilitarians have accused the artisans of being narrow and subjective, saying they are mounted on a pneumatic horse
 kalavaadiyon ne upyogetavaadiyon par sthool saamaajikta kaa agrahi hone kaa laanchhan lagaaya or kaha, unhone hamen swarg dene kaa vachan diya tha, lekin diya he ruganalay
 There is also a third class of thinkers who consider the coordination of the individualism of artism and the socialism of utilitarianism beneficial
 kalavaadi drushtikon kii pratyakshapratyaksh satta europe main plato tathaa arestu se lekar aaj tak kisi na kisi rup main lagaataar milti he
 Plato, in his treatise 'republic', has given a system of nationalizing poets and artists; Because, in his view, the immense influence of imaginative artists and poets was undesirable ethically and socially
 arestu ne yadhyapi apane guru plato kii naitik evam saamaajik dharna kaa khule rup main khandan nahin kiya he, saath hi kala main naitik tatv tathaa upadeshaatmakataa bhi unhen amaanya nahin kiya he, to bhi prasiddh kalasmeekshak bujar ke matanusaar arastu ne hi pehle pahal kalashaastra ne nitishastra ko pruthak kiya or bataaya ki parishkrut anandanubhuti hi kavyakala athwa kala kaa charam lakshya hota he
 The famous thinker of Rome, Cicer, has determined decency and sublime to be the chief productions of art
 longinus ne apni kriti 'periipsus' main kala ko na keval shiksha or manoranjan se bhinn evam shreshth mana he balki use samprerana ke ucch dharaatal par pratishthit karke, uske swatantra moolyankan kaa paraamarsh bhi diya he
 According to Longinus, the main elements of poetry and art are sublime and sublimation of emotion is their main result which is directly related to the person as well as the society
 at: apane vaktavy or pratipaadan main longinus nishchit hi madhyamargi hai
 Dionysis and Demetrius Prabhriti Many other Roman thinkers have laid special emphasis on the stylistic aspect of poetry and art
 europe kii shastreey yaa clasical kala kaa pallavan adhikanshat: isai dharm athwa 'carch' ke sarankshan main hua
 Therefore, between the seventh and the 15th century CE, the Roman art that developed from Egypt to Russia, with Rome as the center, was ethically-religious-values-coordinated as a church dependent, so it was necessary to be objective and didactic and that is why There was only secondary accessory in it
 to bhi aisa nahin he ki ukt kaal kii kala main kalpana tathaa bhaawanaaon ke liye koi chhot thi hi nahin
 In contrast, religiously artists used to create high quality art without any external control or compulsion
 talsty kalavaadi vichaardhaara ke prabal virdohi the
 Their lack of faith towards religion gives rise to artistic ideas and art is neither pleasurable nor beauty
 ve naitikta ke prati atyagrahi the or gandhi ji kii tarahat unka drushtikon sudhaarwadi tha
 Reformism is essentially utilitarianism
 at: talsty ke liye kala nishchit hi ek gaun saadhan maatr rahaa
 The great poet of Italy, Aligiari Dante, again reputed the sublime qualities and grand style in the field of art
 dante kaa prabhaav kuch hi din rahaa
 After this, the classical vision gradually came to be covered with romantic view
 falat: is samay kala sambandhi mulyon main baari parivartan hua
 The 17th century can be said to be quite important from the point of view of art
 iske dauraan france main navyashastravaad kaa udai hua
 But this too was no more than a newer version of medieval thought
 renesaan ke baad europe main madhyakaalin naitik mulyon kaa vighatan hona shuru hua jisase paramparawaadi tathaa swatantramulak vichaaron ke bich asthirataa kaa vaataavaran hi utpann nahin hua balki paraspar takaraav bhi hone laga
 The reason for this was the lack of a strong philosophy at this time
 san 1866 i
 ke lagbhag vividh saahitiyik evam kalasambandhi vaadon ke pravartan main agrahi desh france main 'l aart por l aart' sutarakathan saamne aayaa jiskaa angreji anuwaad 'art for arts sek' he or hindi main jise 'kala kala ke liye' vaakyansh se janaa jaataa he
 It is from here that the artistic ideology can be seen as a direct beginning
 amareeki chitrakaar james abot mecnil hvisler, jo aaajeevan france or england main karyrat rahaa, kalawaad kaa prabal samarthak bana
 It was that Ruskin, a noted English critic at the Grosswainer painting exhibition in 1877 AD, sharply criticized the Whistler's paintings, saying that the Whistler poured colorful cups on the faces of the audience through his paintings
 raskni ke is kathan par adaalat main mukadmaa shuru ho gaya jisamen hvisler ko antat: kshatipurti ke rup main ek fading mila
 Even then, there was debate between Ruskin and Hwisler about the purpose of art
 ruskin kala ko naitikta se alag-thalag bilkul swantatra evam swat:purna maanata tha
 Inspired by this, Hwisler, with all his power, enforced the 'kala Kala K' vote which reached the limits of extremism
 breadle, clive bel, roger faai tathaa george inness ityadi pramukh samalochak kalavaadi vichaardhaara ke prabal poshak the
 Bradley explicitly declared in his treatise 'poetry for Poetry's Sec' that morality is the only external aspect of poetry
 at: kavita kii shreshthata ke liye use anivaary maananaa ekadam besujh hai
 Clive Bell considered the motif in the context of modern painting and in 1914 introduced the theory of 'significant Farm' which was revised by Roger Fi in 1920
 kroche ke abhivyanjanawad se kalawaad ko ek suspasht darshanik aadhaar praapt ho gaya
 On the basis of Kant's founding 'beauty has no external existence', Croche in his treatise called 'la Spirito' has given the power of 'inner wisdom' for aesthetics and states that both aesthetics and beauty are subtle mental pursuits
 
 saath hi varnyavastu tathaa abhivyanjana ke bich tathvik ekta hoti he
 Therefore, it is misleading to look at artisanal and objective aspects
 kroche ke anusaar kala mulat: ek aadhyatmik kriya he, isliye uski drushti main abhivyanjana ke atirikt kala ko koi anya uddeshy athwa prayojan nahin hota
 Not only this, Croche also considered art to be free from moral and academic limitations
 dekha jaae to kroche ke siddhant dwaara ek prakaar se upyogetavaadi manyata kaa khandan ho jaataa he, lekin ukt siddhant kala ke amoort vyapaar par hi lagu hota he, moort par nahin
 Kroche's art theory is not essentially anti-social because even if it is tangible, he does not consider art as social
 friid ke 'swapnavaad' se bhi kalavaadi drushti ko kaaphi bal mila
 In his book 'principles of Literary Criticism', IA Richard's, while denouncing the artistic vision on theoretical grounds, gave great importance to the remittance in poetry process and said that the power of poetry is not different from the rest of the world nor does the feeling of poetry The rest is different from the experience of the world
 is prakaar richards ne kala ke kshetra main upyogetavaad ko pun: pratishtha kii
 The rise of Marxism led to a rapid disintegration of artistic beliefs
 marks ne apane arthshaastra main kala ke prati upyogetavaadi drushtikon apanaaya or kaha ki kala janata ke liye, mukhyat: sainikon or shramikon ke liye hi he
 Stalin considered art and literature in Russia and Mao in China as the main means of propagating politics, and placed a curse on him with power
 maao ne 'prablems ov art and litarechar' sheershak apane paripatr main marks kii uparyukt sthapanaaon ke prati aasthaa vyakt kii he
 Marxist critic Codwell has also termed the artistic ideology as the result of a sickening attitude created by a purely bourgeois view
 marxvaadi kheme main tratski hi ek aisa vyakti he ja kala ke kshetra main raajnneetik party ke hastekshap ko anuchit maanata he
 In his treatise titled 'literature and Revolution', he has clearly stated, there is no need to order the party in the field of art
 yah thik he ki party ke kartavyon main kala kii raksha or uski sahaayta karnaa bhi he, lekin nettrutv us kshetra main aparoksh rup se hi ho saktaa he
 IP here With the study of physiology and psychology presented by scholars like Pavlov, it has finally been decided that art is as useful for the individual and society as other general physical material
 bhartiya sahitya main bhi alankaar, reeti, vakrokti aadi se sambandhit anek aise sampradaay rahe hai jinaki drushti main kalapaksh adhik mahatvapurn tha
 In the modern literature of Hindi, Premchand, Dinkar etc
 were utilitarian, then Prasad adopted a blissful vision which is much closer to artism
 agyeya, mahadevi verma aadi kalavaadi hai to acharya ramchandra shukla, dow hajariprasad dvivedi, doramvilas sharma aadi aalochakon kii drushti vishuddh upyogetavaadi he
 Dr
 Shyamsundardas considers the integrated form of artism and utilitarianism in literature to be the best and the best

 yaugandharayan ko jyotishiyon ke dwaara pataa chalata he ki magadh-naresh kii bahan padmavati kaa vivaah jin naresh se hoga ve chakravarti samraat ho jaayenge
 Yoongandharayana thought that if Padmavati is married to Udayana in any way, Udayan will definitely get his Vatsa kingdom back from Aruni and he will also become Chakravarti emperor
 yaugandharayan maharaj udayan ke vivaah padmavati se karvaa dene kii apni yojana ke vishay main vaasavadatta ko bataaya
 Vasavadata, who wishes her husband all the best, agreed to this marriage
 kintu yaugandharayan bhaleebhanti jaanate the ki udayan apni patni vaasavadatta se aseem prem karte hai or ve apane duusare vivaah ke liye kadaapi raji nahin honge
 Therefore, he made a plan together with Vasavadatta and another minister, Rummavan
 yojana ke anusaar udayan ko rajpariwaar tathaa vishwaasapaatr sahyogiyon ke saath lekar akhet ke liye van main bheja gaya jahaan ve sabhi log shivi main rahane lage
 One day, when Udayan had left for Mrigaya, the camp was set on fire
 udayan ke waapas lautne par rumnvan ne unhen bataaya ki vaasavadatta shivi main lagi aag main fas gayi thim or unhen bachaane ke liye yaugandharayan vahaan ghuse jahaan par donon hi jal mare
 Udayan was deeply saddened by this news, but Rumwan and other Amatya handled him in many ways by giving them solace
 idhar yaugandharayan vaasavadatta ko saath lekar parivrajak ke vesh main magadh raajputree padmavati ke paas pahunch gaye or prachhann vaasavadatta ko padmavati ke paas dharohar ke rup main rakh diya
 Avantika became Padmavati's special grace character
 unhone maharaj udayan kaa gungan kar kar ke padmavati ko unke prati aakarshith kar liya
 Udayan did not want to get a second marriage, but Rummavan persuaded him to get married to Padmavati
 is prakaar udayan kaa vivaah padmavati ke saath ho gaya
 After marriage, Udayan with the help of Magadha-king attacked Aruni and defeated him and took back his kingdom
 ant main atyant naatakeey dhang se yaugandharayan or vaasavadatta ne swayan ko prakat kar diya
 Yoongandharayana pleaded forgiveness for his audacity and audacity

 They keep calling 'ha Vasavadatta', 'ha Vasavadatta' in the dream, at the same time Avantika reaches there

 America's independence war brought a new twist in the history of European colonialism
 usne africa, asia evam latin america ke rajyon kii bhavi swatantraaa ke liye ek paddati taiyaar kar di
 Thus, the result of the war of America was not only that the 13 colonies separated from the mother country, but that the colonies became a laboratory of new political ideas and institutions in a way
 pehali baar 16veen 17veen shatabdi ke europea upniveshwaad or vaanijyawad ko chunauti dekar vijay praapt kii
 The struggle for liberation of the American colonies from the suzerainty of England was different from other conflicts in history

 The American colonies fought against the harsh colonial policy of the Government of England to maintain their independence and independence in practice

 a fierce naval war took place between England and Spain in 1588 AD, in which Spain was defeated and with this established British naval superiority and England established its colonial settlements in America
 1775 i

 These American colonies can be divided geographically into three parts- in upniveshon main 90% angeraj or 10t% dach, german, francisi, portugali aadi the
 In this way, the American colony was part of both the Western world and the New World

 In a way, mixed culture was born here because people from different regions had different means of their own customs, religious beliefs, governance, organization and living

 In other words, it can be said that the American Revolution was the result of multiple economic, political, social and religious powers simultaneously
 america main aakar basane vaale apravasi england ke nagarikon ke apeksha kahin adhik swatantry permi the
 The reason for this was that the society here was far more egalitarian than in Europe
 america samaaj kii khaas visheshta thi-samantvaad evam atoot varg simaaon kii anupasthiti
 The upper class in American society had less political and economic power than in British society

 Immigrants began to work according to British law and the constitution, as they set foot on the new continent
 unki apni raajnneeti sansthaaen thi
 Thus there was a system of self-government in the American colonies from the very beginning, which developed over time

 In addition to assisting in the work of governance there was a legislative house / assembly consisting of representatives elected by the public
 is vidhayak sadan ko kar lagane, adhikariyon kaa vetan tay karne, kanoon nirmaan karne kaa adhikaar tha
 But the governor had full authority to accept or repeal the laws
 is vyavastha se upniveshon kii janata main asantosh upja
 England did not try to curb the independence and self-government of the colonies at the outset because there was a continuous struggle between the monarchy and Parliament in the nearly 85 years from the early 17th century to the "bloodless revolution" in England
 phir jab sarkaar ne vibhinn karon ko lagaakar unhen sakhti se vasuulne kaa prayaas kiya to upniveshon main asantosh panpa or yahi asantosh kranti main badal gaya
 French colonies were spread across North America from Quebec to the Mississippi Valley

 As a result, between 1756-63, there was a seven-year war between the two and England was victorious in this and the British colonies in Canada became British
 is yuddh ke parinamswaroop america main uttar se francisi khatra khatm ho gaya
 Hence the dependence of the colonists on England was ended

 The second effect was that England took control of the vast area in North America from the Mississippi River to the Alagani ranges

 As a result there was conflict
 atah england kii sarkaar ne 1763 main ek shahi ghoshnaa dwaara florida, mississippi aadi pashchimi ke kshetra red indian ke liye surakshit kar diya
 This halted the spread of the colonists to the west and they considered the government of England as their enemy
 iske atirikt saptavarshiya yuddh ke dauraan england ko bahut adhik dhanrashi kharch kerani padi jiske kaaran england ko aarthik samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 British politicians believed that England had spent money to protect the colonies, so the colonies should pay more taxes to England
 yahi vajah he ki pehle se lagu jahajrani kanoon, vyapaarik kanoon, sugar act aadi kadai se lagu kiye gaye
 But the colonists were not ready to pay for that situation
 is prakaar saptavarshiya yuddh ne america swatantraaa sangram ke sutarapaat main mahati bhoomika nibhaai
 The economic exploitation of the colonies by England was the main cause of discontent between the colonies and the homeland
 prachlit vaanijyavaadee siddhanth ke anusaar england upniveshon ke vyapaar par niyantran rakhana chahta tha or unke bazaaron par ekadhikaar rakhana chahta tha
 The system of colonies was based on the principle that "colonies are for the benefit of England"
 england ne apane laabh ko drushtigat rakhte hue kanoon banaae- Navigation law: According to the provision of 1651 AD, trade in the colonies could be done only through ships from England, Ireland or colonies
 iske tahat yah vyavastha kii gai ki england ke liye aavashyak sabhi prakaar ke kachche maal bina england ke bandargahon par laae, upniveshon se duusare sthanon par niryaat nahin kiye jaae
 This benefited England's shipping industry as well as the merchants of England
 Under the law of 1663 it was said that the goods exported from Europe to the American colonies would first be brought to the ports of England
 is kanoon se england ke vyapaariyon tathaa vyapaaree bedo ke maalikon ko america upabhokta kii keemat par laabh hota tha
 These laws were unjust to the colonists
 vyapaarik adhinium : england ne kanoon banaaya ki america main utpaadit vastuon jaise chaaval, loha, lakdi, tambaakoo aadi kaa niryaat keval england ko hi kiya ja saktaa tha
 These rules created great fury in the colonies
 kyonki france evam dach vyapaaree unhen in vastuon ke liye angerajon se adhik mulya dene ko taiyaar the
 Industrial Act: England enacted the law that the industrial goods which were produced in England could not be manufactured by its American colonies
 is prakaar 1689 ke kanoon dwaara upniveshon se oonee maal tathaa 1732 i

 Although the above laws were detrimental to the colonies, the colonies did not oppose them as they were not strictly enforced

 Education and journalism developed along with the stability of life in America which contributed to the development of intellectual consciousness

 Britain tried to raise local taxes by implementing several types of tax laws in the American colony

 a constitutional issue also arose here
 british kaa maananaa tha ki british sansad sarvocch shakti he or vah apane america upnivesh ke maamle main kisi prakaar kaa kanoon paarit kar sakati he
 Whereas, the American colonies believed that the right to tax them lies only in the assemblies of the colonies and not in the British Parliament because they lack representation

 As before, the company's ships were not required to arrive and pay taxes on the ports of England
 is kadam kaa lakshya tha company ko ghate se bachaana tathaa america logon ko chaay uplabdh karana
 But the people of the American colony were unhappy with this monopoly of the company because such a rule was made without the consent of the colonies
 atah upnivesh main is chaay niti kaa jamkar virodh hua or kaha gaya ki “sasti chaay” ke madhyam se england bahari kar lagane ke apane adhikaar ko banaae rakhana chahta tha
 Hence, agitation started against the tea scheme in the whole country

 In American history, this event is called the Boston Tea Party

 Therefore, the British government enacted harsh and oppressive laws to punish the American colonists
 boston bandargah ko band kar diya gaya
 The government of Massachusetts was reorganized and the power of the governor was increased and soldiers were made to live in the city and murder cases were transferred from American courts to England and other colonies

 england dwaara nae upniveshon kii sthapana : 13 america upniveshon ke swatantra ho jane se england ke aupniveshik samrajya ko thes pahunchi
 To regain their lost prestige and secure business interests, colonization was attempted in new territories and it was in this context that British colonies were established in Australia and New Zealand

 england kii aupniveshik niti main parivartan : america upnivesh ke haath se nikal jane se british sarkaar ne yah anubhav kar liya yadi shesh bache hue upniveshon ko apane adheen rakhana he to use aupniveshik shoshan kii niti ko chhodana or or upniveshon kii janata ke adhikaron evam maangon kaa sammaan karnaa hoga
 On the basis of this changed policy, in the 19th and 20th centuries, the British Government established the British Commonwealth of Nations, ie the British Commonwealth

 In fact, the main principles of the French Revolution can be seen in the Native American struggle for freedom, equality and fraternity

 In another way, the impact of the American Revolution can be seen on India
 vastutah america kranti ke anek kaarnon main ek kaaran yahi bhi tha ki british ne america upniveshon ke shashan main prabhavi hastkshep nahin kiya tha
 As a result, the American colonists developed a system of independent consciousness and self-government
 jab british ne vahaan hastkshep kiya to asantosh upja
 Therefore, Britain learned from this situation and continued active intervention in the internal affairs of the Indian colony from the earliest stage and limited the freedom of its inhabitants
 sahaayak sandhi evam vilay kii niti ke madhyam se bharat ke aantarik maamalon main british hastkshep kiya gaya evam foot daalon tathaa shashan karo kii niti apanaakar bhartiya virgon ko alag-alag rakhaa gaya
 In this way, learning from the American conditions, conditions were created in India that divided the people and kept the British Empire's hold on the colonial empire
 is tarah ham kah sakate hai ki america swatantraaa yuddh ne britain ko ek samrajya se to vanchit kar diya lekin ek-duusare samrajya kii neenv ko majboot kar diya
 The American freedom struggle can be seen divided into two phases - the first phase was the period of 1762-72, the period of revolutionary movement and during this period, the voice against colonial exploitation was raised and internal reforms were emphasized within the British Empire itself
 kintu jab yah prayaas vifal ho gaya tab 1772 ke pashchaat doosraa charan aarambh hota he jo swatantraaa-sangram kaa charan rahaa
 At this stage, American leaders not only challenged the right to tax, but declared that the British Empire itself was the main problem and the only way out of it
 is prakaar america swatantraaa sangram kii prakriya kranti se shuru hui or jisaki parinti swadhinata sangram ke rup main hui
 It is called a revolution because in the context of entire modern world history, radical changes were brought about on political, social and ideological aspects

 This class raised its voice against the privileges of the colonial rulers and led the revolution

 In this revolution fought on ideological basis, middle class issues took prominence

 The middle class was the main signer of the Declaration of Independence

 atah Normally, the ratio of energy consumption in a device to the force produced by it can be understood in such a way that if the fuel burns in an inertial engine, it not only generates electricity by running the generator but also in the process Fuel is ignited to run the engine, due to which the heat produced with the engine is also produced as a product, the higher the heat
 Will it reduce the capacity to make electricity

 The carbon cycle is the bio-geochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged with the biosphere, the planetarium, the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, and the Earth's atmosphere
 yah prithvi ke sabase mahatvapurn chakron main ek he or jeevamandal tathaa uske samast jeevon ke saath carbon ke punarnavinikaran or punarupyog ko anumat karata he
 The carbon cycle was initially discovered by Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier, and propounded by Humphrey Davy
 ab ise aam taur par vinimay margon dwaara jude paanch pramukh carbon bhandar ke rup main mana gaya he
 These stores are: carbon ke vaarshik sanchalan, bhandaron ke bich carbon vinimay, vibhinn rasinic, bhautik, bhuvaigyanik or jaivik prakriyaaon kii vajah se hote hai
 The largest active reservoir of carbon is near the sea near the Earth's surface, but the deep-sea portion of this reservoir does not rapidly exchange with the atmosphere
 vaishvik carbon bajet carbon bhandaron ke bich yaa carbon chakra ke ek vishisht chakra ke bich carbon ke vinimay kaa santulan he
 Testing the carbon budget of a reservoir or reservoir can provide information on whether the reservoir or reservoir is acting as a source of carbon dioxide or as a merger trough
 prithvi ke vayumandal main carbon mukhya rup se gasiy carbon dioxide ke rup main maujuud he
 Although it is a small percentage of the atmosphere, it plays an important role in supporting life
 vayumandal main maujuud carbon yukt anya gaisen hai methane or chlorophlorocarbon 
 vriksh prakaash sanshleshan ke dauraan, prakriya main oxigen ko chhodte hue, carbon dioxide ko carbohydrate main badalte hai
 This process occurs more in relatively new forests, where the growth of trees is even more rapid
 iskaa prabhaav vasant ke dauraan pattey nikalate samay parnpaati jangalon main zyaada rahata he
 This is evident in the Keeling curve of measured CO 2 concentrations as an annual signal
 uttari golarddh vasant prabal rahata he, chunki vahaan shitoshna akshansh par dakshini golarddh kii tulana main kaafii zyaada bhoomi he
 Carbon can be released into the atmosphere in several ways: lagbhag 42,000 gigaton carbon jeevamandal main maujuud he
 Carbon is an essential part of life on Earth
 yah sabhi jivit koshikaon kii sanrachana, jaev-rasayan or poshan main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Otherwise, anoxic respiration occurs and releases methane into the surrounding environment, which eventually makes its way into the atmosphere or hydrosphere
 jeevamandal main carbon kaa bhandaaran vibhinn kaal-maanon main asankhya prakriyaaon dwaara prabhavit hota he: jabaki shuddh praathmik utpaadakta dainik or mausami chakra kaa anusaran karti he, carbon vrikshon par saikadon varsh or mitti main hazaron varshon tak sangrahit kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus changes in those long-term carbon pools can affect global climate change
 sagar main lagbhag 36,000 gigaton carbon maujuud he, jisamen adhikansh bicarbonate aayan ke rup main he harrican or tiphone jaise prachand toofaan bahut zyaada carbon dafanaate hai, kyonki ve itnaa zyaada avsaad dur dho daalate hai
 For example, in the July 2008 issue of the journal Geology, a team reported that a lone typhoon in Taiwan buried as much carbon in the ocean — as depression — as all other rains in that country throughout the year
 Inorganic carbon, i
e
 carbon compounds without carbon-carbon or carbon-hydrogen bonds, are important in their reactions underwater
 yah carbon vinimay sagar ke ph ko niyantrit karne ke liye mahatvapurn ho jaataa he or carbon ke strot yaa vilay ke rup main alag bhi ho saktaa he
 Carbon is easily exchanged between the atmosphere and the ocean
 samudri urdhv-pravaahee kshetron main, carbon vayumandal main vimochit hota he
 Conversely, carbon in the downstream regions transfers from the atmosphere to the ocean
 jab CO2 samudr main pravesh karata he, vah silsilewar pratikriyaaon main bhaag letaa he, jo sthaneey rup se santulan main hai: Solution: carbonic amla main roopantaran: First ionization: dwitiya ynikaran: This set of reactions, each with its own equilibrium coefficient, determines the form of inorganic carbon in the oceans
 The experimentally determined coefficients for seawater are functions for the temperature, pressure, and other ions present
 mahaasaagar main santulan prabhaavshaalee rup se bicarbonate kaa paksh lete hai
 Since this ion is three phases away from atmospheric CO2, the storage level of inorganic carbon in the ocean is not a ratio of CO2 to the atmospheric partial pressure per unit
 samudr ke liye kaarak he das: arthath vayumandaleey CO2 main 10% vruddhi ke prati, samudri bhandaaran vruddhi lagbhag 1% hoti he, jahaan vaastavik ghatak sthaneey paristhitiyon par nirbhar hai
 This intermediate factor is often called the "revel factor" after Roger Revell
 mahasaagaron main draveebhoot carbonate, visheshkar sookshm jeevon ke khol ke rup main, thos calcium carbonate, caco3, avakshepit karne ke liye draveebhoot calcium ke saath sanyojit hota he
 When these organisms die, their shells sink and accumulate on the ocean floor
 samay ke saath ye carbonate avsaad chuunaa pathar banaate hai, jo carbon chakra main carbon kaa sabase bada bhandar he
 Fluid calcium in the oceans comes from the chemical weathering of calcium-silicate rocks, when carbonic and other acids in ground water react with calcium-rich minerals to release calcium ions in the solution and new aluminum-rich smooth mineral soils
 And the remains of indestructible mineral matter like crystalline are left behind
