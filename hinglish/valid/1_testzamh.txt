 Also, the situation has become even more suspicious in the various Puranas due to the absence of death in the context of the Satavahanas
 yadhyapi gunadhay dwaara rachit brihad katha ko satvaahan rajya sangrakshan main likhaa hua mana jaataa he tathaapi yah kriti ab mul rup main nahi milti tathaa i par aadhaarit uske baad ke sanskarnon main di gai soochnaaon kii vyavastha vibhinn vidwaanon alag-alag kii he
 Similarly, Lilavati, which is related to the military campaigns and victories of the Satavahana ruler period, cannot be overstated

 There are profound differences among various scholars regarding the emergence of Satavahanas and their original place of residence
 shilaalekh tathaa sikkon main varnit satvaahan or shatakarni shaskaon ko puraanon main andhra, andhra-mrity tathaa andhra jaateey naamon se pukaara gaya he
 On this basis, scholars have reached the decision that Satavahana or Shatakarani kings were equivalent to Andhra
 rapasan, smith tathaa bhandarkar ke anusaar satvaahan shaasha andhra desh se sambandhit the
 About the Andhra people, the Puranas say that they were residents of the ancient Telugu region which was situated in the middle of the Godavari and Krishna river

 But what happened to them after the fall of the Maurya Empire is not known

 Although the historians mentioned above consider Andhra Pradesh as the original abode of the Satavahanas, there are differences among these scholars regarding the center of their power
 jahaan smith shri kakulam ko satvahanon athwa andhron kii rajdhani maanate hai
 But scholars have differences regarding the relationship with Satavahanas
 samvaahan vansh ke shilalekhon main i kaal ke shaskaon ko nirantar rup se satvaahan athwa shatakarni kaha gaya he
 In the literary texts, the term Shali Vahan is also used for them
 parantu is sandarbh main andhra shabd kaa prayog is vansh ke kisi bhi shilaalekh main nahi he
 On the other hand, western India has been considered as their original place of residence on the basis of inscriptions, coins and literary sources
 is tathy kaa pramaan nanaghat tathaa saachin ke aarmabhik shilalekhon se bhi miltaa he
 On this basis, Dr
 Gopalachari has considered the original residence of the Satavahanas of the establishment and its surrounding area

 On this basis, the equivalence and homogeneity of Satavahanas and Andhra is doubtful
 is vishay main vidwaanon ne yah sujhaayaa he ki satvahanon ne apane aarmabhik jivan kii dakkan se shuruyaat kii tathaa kuch hi samay main andhra pradesh ko bhi jeet liya
 Later, when the western and northern regions of the Satavahana kingdom continued to pass through their hands due to suspicion and rich invasions, their power was probably limited to the central region between Godavari and Krishna river i
e
andhra Pradesh and now Satavahanas came to be known as Andhra

 Some scholars have compared him to the Satyaputras mentioned in the inscriptions of Ashoka and some to the Setai described by Pliny

 The proof of this is also found in the Nasik inscription, in which Gautami's son Shri Shatkarni has been decorated as a Brahmin and Khatiyya-swa-man-madan, ie, a man who marshals of Kshatriyas, etc
 isi shilaalekh ke lekhak ne gautamiputra kii tulana parashuram se kii he
 In addition, in the Datrishatputlika also, the Shalivahanas are said to have originated from mixed Brahmin caste and Nagajati
 satvahanon ke kalkram ko lekar vidwaanon main gahare matbhed hai
 The Aitreya Brahmana, which was written in 500 BC, mentions the bandits who were outside the Arya Periphery and who were the descendants of Vishwamitra

 According to Dr
 V
 A
 Smith, Andhra was subordinate at first, but after his death he became independent under the leadership of Simukh and this incident happened in the third century BCE
 is vishay main smith ne puraanon kaa hi aadhaar mana he jinke anusaar andhron ke kul tees shaskaon ne lagbhag 460varshon tak shashan kiya
 Dr
 Gopalachari also accepted this fact by acknowledging that the Satavahana dynasty was founded around 235 AD and its fall in about 255 AD
 kaling ke shaasha kharkhel ke rajyakaal main utkeern hathi gumpha shilaalekh ke aadhaar par rapasan satvaahan vansh kaa armbh 220 i0purv tathaa 211 i0purv ke bich maanate he parantu satvahanon ke yasana kaal ko lekar vibhinn puraanon main bhi mataantar he
 On one hand, where the Matsya Purana states their total Yasan period is 460 years, on the other hand, in Brahmapuran this period is stated to be 456 years

 But this fact is unbelievable because we know very well that the rulers of Sunga and Kanva dynasty never ruled jointly and Vasudeva Kanva, the founder of Kanva dynasty, took over the reins of the reign by killing the last Sunga ruler Devbhuti
 vayupurana ke us vaktavy jiske aadhaar par dobhandarkar ne galat vyakhya kii he, ko doray choudhary ne sahi bhang se paribhaashit kiya he
 According to him, this dirty volume tells this much that when Simuk ended the Kanva dynasty and established the Satavahana dynasty, he also abolished the Sunga rulers who remained after the defeat of the Sunga rulers at the hands of the Kanva dynasty
 
 atev satvaahan shaskaon ne 29 i0purv main kanv vansh kaa ant kar swayan shashan kii bagdor sanbhali
 But notwithstanding all these factors one cannot deny the possibility that Simuk, who ruled for 23 years, would have been enthroned sometime back i
e
 in the middle of the first century BCE
 simuk satvaahan vansh kaa sansthaapak tha tathaa usne 235 i0pus0 se lekar 212i0pus0 tak lagbhag 23 varshon tak shashan kiya
 Although we do not get much information about it, it is known from the Puranas that by destroying the power of the Kanva rulers and suppressing the remaining Sunga chiefs, he laid the foundation of the Satavahana dynasty
 puraanon main use simec ke atirikt shishuk, sindhuk tathaa shiprak aadi naamon se bhi pukaara gaya he
 According to Jain observers, Simuk built Jain and Buddhist temples during his reign, but at the end of his reign, he was stunned and cruel due to which he was removed and murdered
 simuk kii mrityu ke pashchaat uskaa chota bhai kanha rajgaddi par baitha
 During his 18-year tenure, Kanha adopted the policy of empire expansion
 nasik ke shilaalekh se yah pataa chalata he ki kanha ke samay main satvaahan samrajya pashchim main nasik tak fail gaya tha
 After shatkarni-i Kanha, Shatkarni ascended the first throne
 puraanon ke anusaar vah kanha putr tha
 But Dr
 Gopalachari considers Simuk as the father of Shatkarni I
 kuch vidwaanon ne yah mana he ki iskaa shashan kaal maatra do varsh rahaa parantu nilkantha shastri ne uskaa shashan kaal 194 i0pus0 se lekar 185 i0pus0 mana he
 However, it is clear that his reign was not very long
 parantu chota hote hue bhi shatakarni pratham kaa kaarykaal kuch drushtikonon se bada mahatvapurn he
 He was the first among the Satavahana rulers who named him by the word "shatkarni", beloved and popular among the rulers of this dynasty
 nanaghat shilaalekh ke anusaar shatakarni ne apane samrajya kaa khub vistaar kiya tathaa apane kaary kaal main do ashwamegh yajna tathaa ek rajasuy yajna kiya
 From an inscription of her queen Nayanika, we learn that Shatkarni i conquered western Malwa as well as Anup and Vidarbha regions
 yadi shatakarni pratham hi vah shaasha he jiskaa ullekh sanchi stupa ke torana main hua he to yah bhi is baat ko pramanit karata he ki uske samay main madhya bharat satvahanon ke adhikaar main tha
 He became the emperor during his work with his umbrellas and he took the titles like Dakshin Pathapati and the Untamed Chakra etc
 nanaghat lekh tathaa hathi gumpha lekhon main prayukt lipi kii samanta ke aadhaar par hi yah sujhaayaa gaya he ki kadaachit isi shatakarni shaskaon ke shashan kaal ke duusare varsh main kaling ke mahaan shaasha kharkhel ne yuddh kshetra main haraaya tha
 Shatkarni I's wife Nayanika or Naganika was the daughter of a maestro, Tranakairo, of Angiyan clan
 shatakarni pratham kii mrityu ke pashchaat uske do alpavyask putr vedashri tathaa satshri singhaasana par baithe
 But being a minor, the administration took the reins of his mother Nayanika, who ruled with the help of her father
 aisa prathit hota he ki vedashri kii alpaayu main hi mrityu ho gai tathaa satshri ne uske uttaradhikari ke rup main shashan sambhala
 But the Puranas are unanimous that after Satakarni I, a king named Purnotsang sat on the throne Satavahana
 chaahe chaturth satvaahan shaasha kaa naam kuch bhi rahaa ho, yah to nishchit he ki is shaasha ke shashan kaal main hi pushyamitra shunga ne antim maury shaasha brahadrath ko maar kar magadh rajya par adhikaar kar liya tha
 In Matsyapuran, Skandastambhi is mentioned as the fifth ruler of the Satavahana dynasty but most scholars consider this name to be fictitious
 shatakarni dwitiya ne lagbhag 166 i0pus0 se lekar 111 i0pus0 tak shashan kiya
 It was probably the same ruler who is mentioned in the inscriptions Heathigumpha and Bhilsa
 yah prathit hota he ki iske shashan kaal main satvahanon ne purvi malwa ko pushyamitra shunga ke ek uttaradhikari se chin liya
 According to the Puranas, after Shatkarni II, Lambodar ascended the throne
 lambodar ke pashchaat uskaa putr apilak gaddi par baitha
 Appellant who was the eighth Satavahana ruler, the period between these two is considered to be the dark age in the context of Satavahanas in which only the period of Kuntal Shatakarni can be considered as an exception
 kuntal shatakarni, apilak ke pashchaat satvahanon kaa aglaa mahatvapurn shaasha tha
 In the Kamasutra, Vatsyayan mentions Kuntal Shatkarni, writing that he used his fingers as a scissor and that his patrani Malayavati died from the stroke
 kawyaminmasha main rajeshwar ne kuntal shatakarni kaa varnan karte hue kaha he ki usne apane ranivas main rahane vaali apni raniyon ko yah aadesh diya tha ki ve keval praakrit bhashaa kaa prayog karen
 Hall was the next important ruler of the Satavahanas
 yadhyapi usne keval chaar varsh hi shashan kiya tathaapi kuch vishyon uskaa shashan kaal bahut mahatvapurn rahaa
 It is believed that if Shatkarni was the greatest as the first warrior among the early Satavahana rulers, Hall was a pioneer as a peacekeeper

 Legend has it that some military operations were carried out in the eastern Deccan, but due to lack of evidence, most scholars consider it wrong

 He conquered the eastern and Paiyachma Malwa territories by the Satavahanas; Northern Konkan also dominated northern Maharashtra, which was the center of the Satavahana power and extended to southern Banavasi

 Ghoomak's successor was Nahapan, whose information we hold on his majority of coins is the title of king
 vahiin shilalekhon uski oopaadhi kshatrap tathaa mahakshatrap mili
 His inscriptions of Nashik, Karle and Junar; All of the donations made by SK majority coins and his Jamta Shak Ashwadat in northern and southern India testify that the empire of the Kshatra dynasty was very vast at the time of Nahapan and that it had taken away a large territory from the Satavahana rulers

 The Satavahana kings who were defeated at the hands of Nahapan were probably the beautiful Shatakarni, Chakor Shatkarni and Sivasati, whose tenure was very short, but this situation did not last long and as the Satavahana ruler of Gautami son Sri Shatakarni became the new ruler in this quasi-satavahana struggle Turned
 lagbhag aadhi shatabdi kii uthapatak tathaa shaq shaskaon ke haathon manamardan ke baad gautami putr shri shatakarni ke netritv main apni khoi hui pratishtha ko purnsthapit kar liya
 Gautami's son Sri Shatkarni was the greatest ruler of the Satavahana dynasty, who ruled for nearly 25 years, not only restored the lost prestige of his empire but also established a vast empire
 gautami putr ke samay tathaa uski vijayon ke baaren main hamen uski mata gautami balashri ke nasik shilalekhon se sampoorn jaankaree milti he
 Gautamiputra Satkarni is also considered by some experts to be King Shalivahana
 unhone puure bharat ko ekajute kar diya or videshi hamalaavaron ke khilaaf bachaaya
 In this context, we get information from this article that he has made the ego of Kshatriyas honorable
 uskaa varnan shaq, yavan tathaa pehlaav shasaskon ke vinaash karta ke rup main hua he
 His greatest achievement was the defeat of Shaka ruler Nahapan of the Kshatra dynasty and his descendants at his hands

 His war with Nahapan took place in the 17th and 18th years of his reign, and after winning this war, the son of Gagatami abducted, Anoop, Saurashtra, Kukar, Akar and Avanti from being drunk
 in kshetron ke atirikt gautami putr kaa rishik, ayamak, mulak tathaa vidarbha aadi pradeshon par bhi adhipaty tha

 It seems that shortly before his death, the territories won by Gautami's son Shatkarni defeated Nahapan and passed away
 gautami putr se in pradeshon ko chhinane vaale sambhawatah sithian jati ke hi karadaamak vansh ke shaq shaasha the
 We find evidence of this by Talmi from his book describing geography
 aisa hi nishkarsh 150 i0 ke prasiddh rudradaman ke junagarh ke shilaalekh se bhi nikaala ja saktaa he
 This inscription shows that Rudradaman captured all the territories of Gautamiputra Shatkarni, who had been conquered by Nahapan
 aisa prathit hota he ki gautamiputra shatakarni ne karadaamak shakon se vaivaahik sambandh sthapit kar rudradaman dwaara hathiyaae gaye apane kshetron ko surakshit karne kaa prayaas kiya

 George Lukach was born on April 13, 1885, in Budapest, Hungary

 In student life itself, he became inclined towards leftist politics

 Many of his books were also published in the same period as a result of the immense hard work done in this field

 The writings of George Lukach present a fine example of multidisciplinary talent
 darshan or sahitya donon par unhone samaan adhikaar se kalam chalaayi he
 As a litterateur, Lukach has also adopted Marxist ideology and confirmed it with a new interpretation
 "marxvaadi sahitya-chintan ke antargat lukach kaa mahatva yatharthwaad ke pramanik vyaakhyaata ke rup main he
 "his critical writing establishes a harmony between both theoretical and applied fields
 'soul and form', 'the meaning of contemporary realism', 'writer and critic' tathaa 'studies in European realism' jaisi pustakon main unka saidhantik lekhan yatharthwaad kii pramanik vyakhya ke rup main drashtavy he
 While he explained the principles of the novel in a book like 'theory of the Novel', in a book like 'the Historical Novel' he also gave a poignant analysis of the nature of the historical novel

 This unique aesthetic philosopher of Hungary, who is completely inspired by Marxist beliefs, has often been reprimanded by fundamentalist Marxists as revisionist, but so indisputable that the deeper the understanding of literature and art, and the more inaugural of their intimate characteristics, we would have found in the works of Lukach Is not elsewhere

 hibun japani sahitya main ek gadhy kii vidha hai
 It consists of both poetry and prose genres
 hibun ek sankshipt gadhy or hiku kaa sammishran he jo ki ek yatra vivaran ke rup main likhaa jaataa hai
 Matsuo Basho, who was a saint and haiku poet, is the originator of this writing style
 unhone apni yatraaon main kai hibun likhe
 The use and construction of contemporary Haibun is still developing
 saamaanya taur par ek hibun main ek yaa do paragraph hote hai or ek yaa do antalsthapit hiku
 The prose portion is usually written first and abbreviated
 usamen kisi drishy yaa kisi vishesh pal kaa varnan badi varnanaatmakataa se kiya jaataa he
 The haiku associated with him has a direct connection with prose, that is, it completely encapsulates the prose and makes an account of that experience
 gadhy va hiku ke vipareet bhaavon ko ikatthe padhakar pathak ko adhik prabhaavshaalee yaa gaharaai kaa anubhav hota he jo keval gadhy yaa keval hiku padhane se nahin mil paata
 It is necessary that nothing should be said in a straight line, but rather a picture of that moment should be put in front of the reader in such a way that he can understand the experience of the writer with his imagination
 vartmaan kaal, gadhy kii sankshiptata or kam shabdon main vaakya vinyas kaa prayog karnaa aadhunik hibun kii rachana main adhimaanya he
 The author of the Haibun portrays the scene with disharmony, avoiding normality
 gadhy ek dainiki kaa bhaag ho saktaa he
 But it should be read several times with great care and care
 ek uttam hibun main gadhy kaa bhaag hiku ke bare main kuch nahin batalaayegaa balki hiku us anubhav ke paribhaashik pal ko badhaava degaa
 Haiku refrains from nouns, verbs, adjectives and karma used in prose in a slanting relationship with prose

 In relation to this, there was also the belief that they are the offspring of the original inhabitants of the fictional island called "atlantis continent" or "moo" of the Pacific Ocean mentioned in legends
 madhya america kii maaya indian jati or pracheen misr kii sthapatyakala main samta drushtigat hone ke kaaran yah anumaan bhi kiya gaya ki indian misr athwa misr se prabhavit deshon se america aae
 In this context, it is necessary to know that the ancient architecture of Egypt had declined several thousand years before the time when the Mayan Indians started construction of temples

 Upon coming to America from Asia, the ancestors of Indians either completely separated from their native Asian branch or maintained some kind of relationship with it, there is a difference of opinion among scholars on this subject
 is prakaar ke sambandhon ko banaae rakhane main jo bhautik kathinaaiyaan thim unke aadhaar par sahaj hi yah anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki yadi in bhubhaagon main sambandh tha bhi to vah apane vistaar or prabhaav main atyant simit rahaa hoga
 Later, the directions of cultural development that these groups adopted were not influenced by the Brahmo cultures
 nav-prastar-yug kii samskruti kaa vikaas in samoohon ne swatantra rup se kiya

 Diffie - Hellman and RSA algorithms are the first known examples of high quality public key algorithms, as well as the most commonly used

 encripshan ke alaava, saarvjaanik kunjee kryptographi kaa upyog digital hastakshar yojanaon ko kriyanvit karne ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 a digital signature is reminiscent of a simple signature; They both have symptoms such that their production posture is for one user, but it is difficult for another to commit forgery
 digital hastakshar ko hastakshar kiye ja rahe sandesh ke avyav se sthaayee rup se baandha ja saktaa he; fir unhen kisi bhi prayaas ke liye ek dastavej se duusare dastavej tak nahin bheja ja saktaa he
 In digital signature schemes, there are two algorithms; One for a signature in which a secret key is used to process the message and another for verification, in which a public matching key is used with the message to check the validity of the signature
 aar es i or di es i do sabase lokapriy digital hastakshar yojanaayen he
 Digital signatures are central to public key infrastructure activity and many network security schemes (many vpns etc
)
 saarvajanik kunjee elgoridam adhikanshtah "mushkil"samasyaon, aksar sankhya siddhant se samasyaon kii computesnal jatilta par aadhaarit hote hai
 For example, the stiffness of RSA is related to the problems of integer factorization
 jabaki difphi - hellman or di es e asatat laghuganak kii samasya se sambandhit hai
 More recently, elliptic curve cryptography has developed, in which the number of security elliptic curves is based on theoretical problems
 antarnihit samasyaon kii kathinaayee ke kaaran, zyaadaatar saarvajanik kunjee elgoridam main modular gunan or ghatiyakaran jaisi gatividhiyaan shaamil hoti hai
 Which are computationally more expensive than most block ciphers, especially techniques used in block ciphers with typical key sizes

 Similarly, hybrid signature schemes are often used in which a cryptographic hash function is computed and only the resulting hash is digitally signed

 yah ek saamaanya galatafahami he ki har ancripshan paddati ko todaa ja saktaa he
 Claude Shannon proved his World War II work at Bell Laboratories that a time pad cipher is not brittle, stating that basic substances are random and can never be used again and state that All are possible attackers and their length is equal to or greater than the message
 ek samay pad, ke alaava adhikansh sifer broot force hamale ke dwaara paryaapt compyutational prayaas se tode ja sakate hai, lekin jaruri prayaas kii maatra sifer ke upyog ke liye aavashyak prayaas kii tulana main ghaateey rup se kunjee ke aakaar par nirbhar kar sakati he, aisi sthiti main, prabhavi suraksha ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he yadi yah sabit ho jaye ki aavashyak prayaas kisi bhi virdohi kii kshamta ke pare he
 That is, it should be shown that no effective methods can be discovered to break the cipher
 chunki vartmaan main aisi koi pradarshan nahin kiye gaye hai, aaj ke samay main ek samay ped ekmaatr saidhantik atoot sifer he
 There are many varieties of cryptanalysis attacks and can be classified in many ways
 ek saamaanya vibhedan is aadhaar par kiya jaataa he ki ek hamalavar kya jaanata he or koun si kshamtaayen uplabdh hai
 In cipher text sole attack, only cipher text is available to the crypto analyzer
 main, kript vishleshak ke liye sifer text or isse sambandhit plane text uplabdh hote hai ek chaynit plane text hamale main, kript vishleshak ek plane text ko chunata he or isse sambandhit sifer text kaa adhyayan karata he, ; iskaa ek udhaaharan he dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan british ke dwaara prayukt gardening 
 Finally, in a selected cipher text attack, the cryptanalyst is able to select the cipher text and study the associated plaintext
 saath hi aksar aisi galtiyaan hoti hai main se ek ke upyog yaa dizin main; iske kuch aitihaasik udaahranon ke liye dekhen anigma kaa kriptenalysis ) Crypt analysis of symmetric key ciphers typically involves searching for attacks against stream ciphers or block ciphers
 ek kushal sifer ke khilaaf kisi bhi hamale kii tulana main yah adhik prabhavi hota he
 For example, a simple brute force attack against DES requires a known plane text and 2 55 decryptions, it attempts at about half of the possible keys to reach a point where there are better possibilities
 lekin yah paryaapt aashwaasan nahin detaa he; di i es ke khilaaf ek raikhik kript analysis ko 2 43 gyaat plane text or lagbhag 2 43 di i es gatividhiyon kii zarurat hoti he
 This is a good improvement on brute force attacks
 saarvjaanik kunjee elgoritham bhinn samasyaon kii compyutational jatilta par aadhaarit he
 The most famous of these is the integer multiplication clause
 lekin asatat laghuganak kii samasyaayen bhi bahut mahatvapurn hai
 Most public keys use statistical algorithms to effectively solve cryptanalysis, these computational problems, or some of them
 
 For example, the best-known algorithms for solving the elliptic curve based version of discrete logarithms take much longer to solve, compared to the best-known algorithms for multiplication blocks to solve common size problems
 is prakaar se, hamale ke liye pratirodh kii tulya kshamta praapt karne ke liye gunan khand par aadhaarit encripshan takneekon ko dirghavrittiya vakr takanic kii tulana main badi kunjiyon kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 For this reason, public key crypto systems based on elliptical curves have become very popular since the discovery in the mid-1990s
 jab shuddh kript analysis elgoritham kii kamajori kaa upyog karata he, krypto pranali par anya hamale vaastavik upkarnon main elgoritham ke upyog par aadhaarit hote hai or ye said chenal hamale kehalaate hai
 If the amount of time is available to a crypt analyzer and the device encrypts a number of plane text, or it detects an error in a password or PIN character, it uses a timing attack to break a cipher Can, which is resistant to analysis
 ek hamalavar mahatvapurn jaankaree praapt karne ke liye sandesh kii lambaai or praturup kaa bhi adhyayan kar saktaa he; yah treffic vishleshan kehalaata he, or yah ek chetavanee virodh ke liye bahut upyogi ho saktaa he
 Not having good administration of a crypto system, such as the use of very small keys, will weaken any system, whether it has all the other properties and of course, social engineering and other attacks that work with the crypto system, or the They handle the message, ransom, blackmail, espionage, torture xxrep 7

 a particularly important issue is the export of cryptographic software and hardware and cryptography

 The coil oscillates on both sides of its deflection when the current is not flowing through the metal structure
 yah ati sookshmagrahi hota he or kshanik aavesh ko bhi badi sugamawapurv isse ham gyaat kar sakate hai
 These are of two types: attractors and repulsors
 vidyutrodhi taron kii ek sthir kundali se yadi vidyutdhara pravaahit ho, to kundali ke bich main or aasapaas main bhi chumbakeey kshetra utpann hota he
 If a piece of cast iron is hung near this horoscope, it gets attracted towards the coil
 is lohe ke tukade main agar ek sanketak laga ho, to sanketak bhi vikshepit ho jayega
 If there is such a mechanism that it can be brought to equilibrium by applying force opposite to the attraction force on the piece of iron, then the value of the current will be known by the deflection of the indicator
 bahudhaa ek sarpil kamaani dwaara is aakarshanabal kaa virodh kiya jaataa he
 The force of attraction is proportional to the square of the current-value
 isliye sanketak kaa vikshep bhi dhara maan ke varg ke samaanupati hoga
 For this reason, it can also find the value of alternating current
 vidyutarodhi taron ke kai chakkaaron kii sthir kundali ke bich, do naram lohe ke patale chad kundali ke aksh ke samaantar lage hai
 One rod is fixed, the other is connected to an indicator which is mounted on a nail itself

 When measurement does not require much precision and many robust instruments are required, then ammeters and voltmeters based on this principle are used
 bijli gharon main switchboard par narm lohe ke yantron kaa hi prayog adhiktar hota he
 The attraction or repulsion in the induced magnet does not depend on the direction of fluency
 bal dharaman ke varg kaa samaanupati hota he
 Therefore whatever the direction of current flow, the direction of force is same
 inhen kaarnon se ye yantra disht dhara athwa prayavartin dhara donon ko naapane ke prayog main laae jate hai
 Due to the inductance of the coil, they cannot be used in the measurement of high frequency alternating current
