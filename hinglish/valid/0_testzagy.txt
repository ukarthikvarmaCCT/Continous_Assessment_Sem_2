 The diet of squirrels consists mainly of many types of plant food, including almonds, seeds, cones, fruits, fungi and green vegetables

 The living squirrels found at this time are divided into 5 sub-families, which consists of about 50 classes and 280 species
 gilahari kaa sarvaadhik purna jeevashm, hesperopits, chadronian ke samay kaa he or aadhunik udan gilahariyon ke saamaan he
 During the latest Eocene to Myocene, there were many squirrels that cannot be placed under the lineage of any living species today
 At least some of these, possibly the oldest, basel, were a type of "proto-squirrels"
 This type of ancient ancestral distribution and variation indicates that squirrels as a group originated from North America

 tritiy vansh ab tak kaa sabase vishaal vansh he or anya sabhi up pariwaron ko sammilit karata he;iskaa vitaran lagbhag bahudeshiy he
 This supports the hypothesis that the common ancestors of squirrels found through all living and fossils lived in North America, since the same lineage appears to have originated — if, for example, assume that the birth of the squirrels If they were from Eurasia, the clues of their ancient lineages should be found from Africa, but looking at the African squirrels it seems that their The origin is quite modern

 The Schiurinae family includes flying squirrels and schiurini, which among others include American tree squirrels; The Sciurini were often seen as a separate family, but they are now seen as a tribe of the Sciurinae

 Whatever the case, the trifurcation of the main squirrel lineage is very convenient in biophysical and ecological terms, with two of the three subfamilies being roughly the same size, each containing around 70–80 species; The third family is twice the other two families
 skiurine ke antargat vrikshiya gilahariyaan aati hai, jo ki america or kuch seemaa tak uresia se hai
 In tropical Asia on the other hand, Kelosquirinae is the most diverse and includes axillary squirrels, but their formation is quite different and they look more "beautiful", which is probably due to the effect of their extremely colorful rows

 For example, in the primitive-indo-european language, the verb 'milk weed' was called 'dugh-to', but Vedic Sanskrit speakers found it easier to say 'the' / 'd' after 'c' / 'd'
 Hence, the 't' of the last joined to its earlier 'd' and became 'd'
 'dugh-to' badalakar 'dugdh' ho gaya
 This is rarely seen, but an example of this can be seen in a Vedic Sanskrit word
 aadim-hind-europi bhashaa main 'saas' ke liye shabd 'swacru' tha jo badalakar pehle 'swashru' bana
 After that, the first vowel became ‘sh’ by joining the ‘sr’ of the previous part of the word ‘s’ and became ‘shvshru’, the Vedic Sanskrit form of the word
 yah bhi bahut kam dekha jaataa he
 In the primitive-indo-european language, 'kharbosh' was called 'kasso', which means 'brown'

 But the Vedic Sanskrit word became 'shash' instead of 'shas' as the 's' of the end became incorporated into the earlier 'sh' sound

 His experiment to measure the density of the Earth became known as 'cavendish Experiment'
 henry cavendish kaa janm nise main 10 oktober 1731 ko hua tha, jahaan us samay unka parivaar rahata tha
 Her mother was Lady Anne Gray, the fourth daughter of Henry Gray, and her father Lord Charles Cavendish, the third son of William Cavendish
 unke vansh kaa nishaan aath sadiyon baad norman ke samay main mila or baariki se yah great britain ke kai kuleen pariwaron se judaa tha
 Her mother died in 1733, three months after the birth of her second son, Frederick, and shortly before Henry's second birthday
 11 saal kii umr main, henry ne landan ke paas ek nijee skool, haikani academy main bhaag liya
 At the age of 18, he entered the University of Cambridge at St Peter's College, now known as Paterhaus, but left three years later without taking a degree on 23 February 1751
 iske baad vah landan main apane pita ke saath rahete the, jahaan unhone jald hi apana prayogshaala bana liya tha
 Lord Charles lived a life of Cavendish service, first in politics and then increasingly in science, especially at the Royal Society of London
 1758 main vah royal socity kii baithkon ke liye henry ko le gaye or royal socity club ke ratribhoj ke liye bhi le gayi
 In 1760, Henry Cavendish was elected to both of these groups, and then stood in his presence

 In 1773 Henry joined his father as an elected trustee of the British Museum, to which he devoted a good deal of time and effort

 Around the time of his father's death, Cavendish began working closely with Charles Blagden, a consortium that helped Blagden fully enter London's scientific society
 badale main, blagden ne cavendish se thodi duuri par duniya banaaye rakhane main madad kii
 By now Cavendish had not even published books and some papers but, he had gained a lot

 Cavendish is considered one of the so-called pneumatic chemists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, along with, for example, Joseph Priestley, Joseph Black, and Daniel Rutherford
 majboot acid ke saath dhaatuon ke sangyojan se, cavendish hydrogen ne hydrogen banaaya — jise vah "jvalansheel hawa" kaha karte the —acid main dhaatuon main ghulaa denevaala ke dwaara
 Although others, like Robert Boyle, had pre-formed hydrogen gas, Cavendish is usually loaned to recognize its fundamental nature
 iske alaava, acid main kshar bhang dwaara, cavendish ne "nishchit hawa" banaaya, jise unhone anya gaison ke saath, pani ke upar ulate bottle main yaa paare main, ekatrit kiya
 He then measured his solubility and specific gravity in water and noted his combustibility
 is patr ke liye cavendish ko royal socity kaali medal se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 Gas was of increasing importance in the late 18th century in chemistry and became important for the improvement of French Antioch Lavalje of chemistry, generally known as the Chemical Revolution
 1783 main cavendish ne ek kaagaj par eudiometry prakashit kiya
 He described a new eudiameter of his own invention, with which he achieved the best results to date, using what in other hands had been the inexact method of measuring gases by weighing them
 He next published a paper on the production of water by burning flammable air in refined air, later publishing the component of atmospheric air
 cavendish ne nishkarsh nikaala ki sophisticated parishkrut hawa parishkrut pani tha or kaha ki hydrogen yaa to shuddh jvalansheeltaa yaa parishkrut pani tha
 He reported these discoveries to Joseph Priestley, an English pastor and scientist, not later than March 1783, but did not publish them until the following year
 scottish avishkaarak james wat ne 1783 main pani kii sanrachana par ek shodh patr prakashit kiya; cavendish ne prayogon kaa pradarshan pehle kiya thalekin duusari baari main prakashit kiya
 Controversy started about priority
 1785 main cavendish aam hawa kii sanrachana ek jaanch se baahar nikle, or prabhaavshaalee sateek parinaam praapt kiya
 He conducted experiments in hydrogen and combined the simple to air ratios and then exploded with a spark of electricity
 iske alaava, he also described an experiment in which he was able to remove, in modern terminology, both the oxygen and nitrogen gases from a sample of atmospheric air until only a small bubble of uncreated gas was left in the original sample
 Using his observations, Cavendish observed that, when he had determined the amounts of phlogisticated air and dephlogisticated air, there remained a volume of gas amounting to 1 / 120 of the original volume of nitrogen
 By careful measurements he was led to conclude that, "common air consists of one part of dephlogisticated air, mixed with four of phlogisticated "
 In the 1890s two British physicists, William Ramsay and Lord Rayleigh, realized that their newly discovered inert gas, argon, was responsible for Cavendish's problematic residue; he had not made an error
 What he had done was performed rigorous quantitative experiments, using standardized instruments and methods, aimed at reproducible results; taken the mean of the result of several experiments; and identified and allowed for sources of error
 The balance that he used, made by a craftsman named Harrison, was the first of the precision balances of the 18th century, and as accurate as Lavoisier's
 Cavendish worked with his instrument makers, generally improving existing instruments rather than inventing wholly new ones
 Cavendish, as indicated above, used the language of the old phlogiston theory in chemistry
 In 1787 he became one of the earliest outside France to convert to the new antiphlogistic theory of Lavoisier, though he remained skeptical about the nomenclature of the new theory
 He also objected to Lavoisier's identification of heat as having a material or elementary basis
 Working within the framework of Newtonian mechanism, Cavendish had tackled the problem of the nature of heat in the 1760s, explaining heat as the result of the motion of matter
 In 1783 he published a paper on the temperature at which mercury freezes and in that paper made use of the idea of latent heat, although he did not use the term because he believed that it implied acceptance of a material theory of heat
 He made his objections explicit in his 1784 paper on air
 He went on to develop a general theory of heat, and the manuscript of that theory has been persuasively dated to the late 1780s
 His theory was at once mathematical and mechanical; it contained the principle of the conservation of heat and even contained the concept of the mechanical equivalent of heat
 Following his father's death, Henry bought another house in town and also a house in Clapham Common, to the south of London
 The London house contained the bulk of his library, while he kept most of his instruments at Clapham Common, where he carried out most of his experiments
 The most famous of those experiments, published in 1798, was to determine the density of the Earth and became known as the cavendish experiment
 The apparatus cavendish used for weighing the earth was a modification of the torsion balance built by Englishman and geologist John Michell, who died before he could begin the experiment
 The apparatus was sent in crates to cavendish, who completed the experiment in 1797–1798 and published the results
 The experimental apparatus improving of a torsion balance with a pair of 2-inch 1
 61-pound lead spheres suspended from the arm of a torsion balance and two much larger stationary lead balls
 Cavendish intended to measure the force of gravitational attraction between the two
 He noticed that Michell's apparatus would be sensitive to temperature differences and induced air currents so he made modifications by isolating the apparatus in a separate room with external controls and telescopes for making observations
 Using this equipment, Cavendish calculated the attraction between the balls from the period of oscillation of the torsion balance, and then he used this value to calculate the density of the Earth
 Cavendish found that the Earth's average density is 5
48 times greater than that of water
 John Henry Poynting later noted that the data should have led to a value of 5
448, and indeed that is the average value of the twenty-nine determinations Cavendish included in his paper
 What was extraordinary about Cavendish’s experiment was its elimination of every source of error and every factor that could disturb the experiment and its precision in measuring an astonishingly small attraction, a mere 1 / 50,000,000 of the weight of the lead balls
 The result that Cavendish obtained for the density of the Earth is within 1 percent of the currently accepted figure
 Cavendish discovered the correct values for the gravitational constants and the mass of the Earth
 uske parinaamon ke aadhaar par, ek g ke mulya kii gananaa joki 6
754 × 10−11n-m2 / kg2 he, jo aadhunik mulya 6
67428 × 10−11n-m2 / kg2 ke saath kripapurvak tulana karti he
 Books often describe cavendish's work as a measurement of either the gravitational constant or the Earth's mass
 Since these are related to the Earth's density by a trivial web of algebraic relations, none of these sources are wrong, but they do not match the exact word choice of cavendish, and this mistake has been pointed out by several authors
 Cavendish's stated goal was to measure the Earth's density, although his result obviously calculates g in order to do so
 The first time that the constant got this name was in 1873, almost 100 years after the Cavendish experiment, but the constant was in use since the time of Newton
 Cavendish's results obviously also give the Earth’s mass
 Cavendish's electrical and chemical experiments, like those on heat, had begun while he lived with his father in a laboratory in their London house
 Lord Charles Cavendish died in 1783, leaving almost all of his very substantial estate to Henry
 Like his theory of heat, Cavendish's comprehensive theory of electricity was mathematical in form and was based on precise quantitative experiments
 In 1771 he published an early version of his theory, based on an expansive electrical fluid that exerted pressure
 He demonstrated that if the intensity of electric force was inversely proportional to distance, then the electric fluid in excess of that needed for electrical neutrality would lie on the outer surface of an electrified sphere; then he confirmed this experimentally
 Cavendish continued to work on electricity after this initial paper, Cavendish wrote papers on electrical topics for the Royal Society but the bulk of his electrical experiments did not become known until they were collected and published by James Clerk Maxwell a century later, in 1879, long after other scientists had been credited with the same results
 Cavendish’s electrical papers from the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London have been reprinted, together with most of his electrical manuscripts, in The Scientific Papers of the Honourable Henry Cavendish, F
R
S
 
 According to the 1911 edition of Encyclopædia Britannica, among Cavendish's discoveries were the concept of electric potential, an early unit of capacitance, the formula for the capacitance of a plate capacitor, the concept of the dielectric constant of a material, the relationship between electric potential and current, laws for the division of current in parallel circuits, and the inverse square law of variation of electric force with distance, now called Coulomb's Law
 Cavendish died in 1810 and was buried with many of his ancestors in the church that is now Derby Cathedral
 vah darbi main par rahete the sadak ko baad main unka naam diya gaya he
 The University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory was endowed by one of Cavendish's later relatives, William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire
 Cavendish was a shy man who was uncomfortable in society and avoided it when he could
 He conversed little, always dressed in an old-fashioned suit, and developed no known deep personal attachments outside his family
 Cavendish was taciturn and solitary and regarded by many as eccentric
 He only communicated with his female servants by notes
 By one account, Cavendish had a back staircase added to his house in order to avoid encountering his housekeeper because he was especially shy of women
 The contemporary accounts of his personality have led some modern commentators, such as Oliver Sacks, to speculate that he had Asperger syndrome, though he may merely have been anthropophobic
his only social outlet was the Royal Society Club, whose members dined together before weekly meetings
 Cavendish seldom missed these meetings, and was profoundly respected by his contemporaries
 However his shyness made those who "sought his views


 speak as if into vacancy
 If their remarks were


worthy, they might receive a mumbled reply, but more often than not they would hear a peeved squeak and turn to find an actual vacancy and the sight of Cavendish fleeing to find a more peaceful corner"
 Cavendish's religious views were also considered eccentric for his time
 He was considered to be agnostic
 As his biographer, George Wilson, comments, "as to Cavendish's religion, he was nothing at all"
 He also enjoyed collecting fine furniture exemplified by his purchase of a set of "ten inlaid satinwood chairs with matching cabriole legged sofa"
 Because of his asocial and secretive behavior, cavendish often avoided publishing his work, and much of his findings were not even told to his fellow scientists
 In the late nineteenth century, long after his death, James Clerk Maxwell looked through Cavendish's papers and found things for which others had been given credit
 Examples of what was included in cavendish's discoveries or anticipations were Richter's law of reciprocal proportions, Ohm's law, Dalton's law of partial pressures, principles of electrical conductivity, and Charles's law of gases
 a manuscript "heat", tentatively dated between 1783 and 1790, describes a "mechanical theory of heat"
 Hitherto unknown, the manuscript was analyzed in the early 21st century
 Historian of science Russell mccormmach proposed that "heat" is the only 18th century work prefiguring thermodynamics
 Theoretical physicist Dietrich Belitz looked that in this work Cavendish "got the nature of heat essentially right
" As Cavendish performed his famous density of the Earth experiment in an outbuilding in the garden of his Clapham Common estate, his neighbours would point out the building and tell their children that it was where the world was weighed
 In honor of Henry Cavendish's achievements and due to an endowment granted by Henry's relative William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire, the University of Cambridge’s physics laboratory was named the Cavendish Laboratory by James Clerk Maxwell, the first Cavendish Professor of Physics and an admirer of Cavendish's work

 The doctrines propounded by Galileo contradicted religious beliefs, for which Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment for trespassing with divine beliefs

 The scientific study of the results of the interrelations of the sounds of the string, or the string, stretched for the music by the father, was done by his son Galileo

 He found that the laws of nature are influenced by each other's factors and there is a relation between the increase and decrease of one as in the equations of mathematics

 'this great mathematician and scientist only dared to measure the speed of light
 iske liye galileo or unka ek sahaayak andheri raat main kai mile dur sthit do pahaad kii chotiyon par ja baithe
 From where Galileo lit the lantern, after getting his assistant's signal, they were to indicate the light through the lantern and its knock
 duusari pahari par sthit unke sahaayak ko laalaten kaa prakaash dekhakar apane paas rakhi duusari laalaten kaa khatka hataakar punah sanket karnaa tha
 Thus Galileo had to estimate the speed of light by looking at the light shining on the top of the second mountain

 In due course, Albert Einstein, the great scientist who solved the intricate relationship between the speed of light and the relationship of energy, referred to him as 'father of modern science'
 galileo dharmik pravruth ke the parantu puraani dharmik manyataon ko vivekshiltaa or prayog ke madhyam se sidv karnaa chaahate the
 In the year 1609, Galileo discovered a telescope that was invented in Holland, with the help of this telescope, one could study their motion by looking at distant celestial bodies
 galileo ne iskaa vivaran sunakar swayan aisi doorabeen kaa nirmaan kar daalaa jo holland main avishkrut doorabeen se kahin adhik shaktishaalee thi
 Based on this, through his observations and experiments, Galileo found that all the planets, including Earth, revolve around the Sun, contrary to the prevailing beliefs in the universe
 isse purv copernicus ne bhi yah kaha tha ki prithvi samet sabhi grah surya kii parikrama karte he jiske liye unhe carch kaa kopbhaajan bananaa padaa tha
 Now, based on the results based on experimentation and discretion, Galilea found it to be the same
 us samay tak yah sarvamaanya sidwant tha ki brahmand ke kendra main prithvi sthit he tathaa surya or chandramaa sahit sabhi akashiya pind lagaataar prithvi kii parikrama karte he
 This recognition was supported by the religious leaders of Tadsamay
 apane prayogon ke aadhaar par praapt parinaamon ke kaaran galileo ne puraani avadharanaon ke virudv khadey hone kaa nirnay liya
 When Galileo made this doctrine public, the Church considered it his disobedience and for this disobedience Galileo was sentenced to imprisonment on behalf of the Church
 galileo ke dwaara diye gayi vichaar ne tadsamay manushya ke chintan kii disha ke naye rup main swikaarne ko vivash kar diya
 Due to social and religious persecution, he could not stand for long with the theories, contrary to the prevailing beliefs and beliefs
 varsh 1633 main 69 varshiya vrudv galileo ko carch kii ore se yah aadesh diya gaya ki ve saarvajanik taur par maafee maangate huye yah kahen ki dharmik manyataon ke virudv diye gayi unke sidwant unke jivan kii sabase bady bhul thi jiske liye ve sharminda hai
 He did the same, but even after this he was imprisoned

 Thus, it took more than three and a half years for the Church to accept its historical error by ordering a 1633 order regarding Galileo, a great astronomer, mathematician, physicist and philosopher

 mcdonald Politics gateway united kingdom kaa samvidhan un sabhi kanoonon evam siddhanton ke samucchy ko kehete hai jiske antargat united kingdom kaa shashan chalata he
 The constitutions of other countries are fully in writing but the UK has no original constitutional document
 isaliye praayah kaha jaataa he ki euke kaa samvidhan alikhit, akodit he
 But the word 'unwritten' is often misleading because most of the British constitution is written in various forms
 @sureshpatelsa Features of British Constitution: british samvidhan ko ”samvidhanon kii janani” kaha jaataa he kyonki sabase puraane is samvidhan ne baad ke sabhi samvidhanon ke liye maardarshak kaa kaam kiya 
 The first democratic governance system of modern world came into existence in Britain, the monarchy
 kulinavaad se prerit rahe britain main rajtantr ke rahete hue bhi prajatantric sansthaaon or pratinidhik shashan kaa vikaas hua or alikhit british samvidhan par rajtantr, kulinatantr or janatantr teenon kaa asar aayaa 
 The characteristics of the British Constitution can only be understood in these contexts as follows: 1
 alikhit samvidhan: Where the constitution of various progressive countries of the world is written, the British constitution is unwritten
 yahi nahin vahaan sarkari kaam kaaj ke niyam aadi kaa bhi adhikansh bhaag alikhit he 
 In fact, the development of the British constitution progressively coincided with the development of other institutions and was never written down because they did not feel its need
 iske peeche mukhya kaaran unki vyavhaarik or spasht soch he 
 The symbol of the rule of law is that Britons are maintaining this symbol without a written constitution, it is a unique feature
 lekin yah bhi ek tathy he ki likhit nyaayik nirnyon, sansadeey adhiniyamon or shasnadeshon ke rup main samvidhan kaa anshatah lekhikaran bhi ho gaya he 
 This has not been done for the purpose of giving written form to the Constitution
 yahi kaaran he ki british samvidhan ek alikhit dastavej hi he 
 2
 Traditionally gradual development: british samvidhan koi ek din yaa ek varsh main ek sthaan par baithkar nahin banaaya gaya 
 It has developed and is continuously developing from the fifth century to the present day
 is samvidhan ke adhikansh aadharbhoot siddhant yaa tark paramparaon par aadhaarit hai 
 JS Mill has called these traditions "the unwritten proverbs of the constitution"
 yadhyapi ye paramparaayen nyaayalay dwaara pravartaneey nahin he tathaapi vahaan kii shashan pranali main maanviya or paalniy he 
 Their importance lies in the fact that the British Raj system cannot be imagined without them
 jaise: Taj to work in consultation with the Cabinet
 jan pratinidhi sadan ke bahumatadhari dal ke netaa ko taj dwaara pradhanmatri niyukt karnaa 
 The collective and individual responsibility of the Cabinet towards the House of Representatives
 sansadeey adhiniyamon ko taj dwaara sweekruti

 Emery states that "the British constitution is a mixture of law, precedence and tradition
" ” 3
 Difference in theory and practice: britain main samvidhan ke alikhit siddhant prachlit hai lekin vyavhaar main kuch bhinnataayen najar aati hai 
 like: britain vidhi ke shashan ko antim maanata he lekin vahaan prashasnic vidhi kaa prachlan nirantar bad rahaa he 
 There is a parliamentary democracy in principle, but the crown is a hereditary, not a mere elected executive
 munro ke anusaar- ”british samvidhan kii ek adbhut visheshta yah he ki yah jaisaa dikhataa he vaisaa he nahin or jaisaa he, vaisaa dikhataa nahin 
 " 4
 sansadeey prajatantr: The parliamentary form of democracy is the creation of Britain
 british sansadeey vyavastha main: There is a dual executive - a nominal executive as the Taj and a real executive as the Council of Ministers
 taj rajya kaa pramukh he jabaki mantriparishad sarkaar kii pramukh he 
 Here the government emerges from the legislature i
e
 the Council of Ministers and the legislature have homogeneous relations
 janpratinidhi sadan main bahumat praapt dal sarkaar banaata he 
 And the government is responsible to this house
 yah uttardaayitv mantriparishad kaa samuhik or mantriyon kaa vyactik donon prakaar kaa hota he 
 On the advice of the Prime Minister, the Taj can dissolve the lower house
 britain main vishisht kism kaa ganatantr he 
 Because a legitimate monarchy exists in this democratic country
 taj kaa chunaav nahin hota or vah vanshanugat pad he 
 The person on whose head the crown is placed becomes the king
 jaan aag isaliye is ”mukutadhaari” ganatantr kehete hai 
 5
 Parliamentary Supremacy: british rajvyavastha kaa aadhaar he- sansadeey sarvocchata kaa siddhant 
 This means: sansad ko koi bhi kanoon banane, sanshodhit karne yaa nirast karne kaa antim adhikaar he 
 De Lolme says- "the British Parliament can do anything except change a woman from man to man
" ” The British Parliament makes general or specific or constitutional law by the same general procedure
 british kanoonon ko nyaayalay main chunauti nahin di ja sakati he 
 The Taj has to sign parliamentary laws
 bejahot likhte hai- ”yadi sansad ke donon sadan uske mrityu-aadesh ko paarit kar uske paas preshit karen to hamen us par bhi hastakshar karne hi padenge 
 " 6
 vidhi kaa saaman: Britain is world famous for the rule of law because the rule of law started not only from here but in its best sense it is applicable in Britain itself
 vidhi ke shashan kaa arth he – saamaanya kanoon kii sarvocchata 
 In "the Law of Constitutions", Dicey states three meanings of the rule of law: saamaanya kanoon kii sarvocchata: Common law is supreme in the country, which does not have the influence of any arbitrary power
 prayek vyakti keval kanoon dwaara hi shasit he 
 equality before the law: kanoon ke samaksh sab vyakti ek samaan hai chaahe unki saamaajik, aarthik, rajnatik haisiyat kuch bhi ho 
 There is only one law for everyone
 swayan samvidhan kanoon kii dein he: In England, the source of civil rights is common law, which is enforced by judicial decisions
 vahaan vidhaan swayan hi in nirnyon-kanoonon ke parinamswaroop viksit hua he 
 7
 Finesse: britain kaa samvidhan prakruti main lachila he or use aasaani se sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he 
 There is no difference between common law and constitutional law, that is, amendments are made through the same general parliamentary process by which common laws are made
 8
 ekaatmak samvidhan: The British Constitution is a single constitution
 yah na sirf sampurna great britain ke liye ek he, apitu yah ikhari naagarikta, ek hi kanoon aadi ko sunishchit karata he 
 9
 Civil Rights: britain kaa samvidhan nagarikon ko anek adhikaar pradaan karata he jaise daihik swatantraaa, sabha-sammelan kii swatantraaa, shastrdharan karne kii swatantraaa, vichaar abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ityadi 
 10
 Unitary State: britain kaa samvidhan sampurna britain ko sangh ke sthaan par ”ekaatmak rajya” ghoshit karata he 
 In this, the entire power is considered to be vested in the central government and it can form and disband regional units, local government etc
 for its governance convenience
 11
 dwi-daleey raajnneetik vyavastha: Britain has adopted a two-party system in place of multi-party, adopting parliamentary democracy
 yahaan anudaar dal or majdoor dal naamak do dalon kaa astitv he 
 12
 Supplementary Act of the Constitution: britain main likhit samvidhan kaa abhaav hote hue bhi aise adhinium hai jo sanvaidhanik mahatv rakhte hai, jaise habius coppers act stateute of westminster, ministars of crown act, pipuls riprogentation act ityadi
