 In Russia there is the Gelukpa School of Tibetan Buddhism, along with other Tibetan schools of Buddhism primarily as minorities
 haalanki tibeti buddha dharm sabase adhik tibet ke saath judaa hua he, yah mongolia ke madhyam se rus main failaa he
 In the 17th century, Tibetan Buddhism spread from Mongolia in the north to the Buryat communities of the Baikal region
 duusari buddha lahar tibet se sidhe aa gai
 Aimed at weakening the influence of Mongols and Mancharchs in the region, the Tsar awarded them the title of Bandido Khambo Lama on the Priors of Gusinoozersk Datsan to accept them as leaders of Buryati Buddhism
 is prakaar, buryaat parampara mongolian carch ke aadhikarik taur par swatantra hua
 In 1741, Queen Elizabeth issued a decree that recognized the Lamaist faith in Buryatia and authorized the establishment of 11 monasteries with 150 lamas
 rus main yah buddha dharm ke sarkari manyata kii tithi maani jaati he
 Buddhism in russiain the early 17th century, Tibetan Buddhism spread north from Mongolia to Buryat communities of the Baikal region
 The second wave came directly from Tibet
 Aiming for weakening the influence of Mongols and Manchurs in the region, the tsar conferred the title of Bandido Khambo Lama on the priors of Gusinoozersk Datsan to acknowledge them as leaders of Buryat Buddhism
 Thus, the Buryat tradition became officially independent of the Mongolian Church
 In 1741, Empress Elizabeth issued a decree that recognized the Lamaistic belief in Buryatia and authorized sanction of 11 monasteries with 150 lamas on the staff
 This is considered the date of the official recognition of Buddhism in Russia
 There were schools opened at datsans and books printed
 In the 18th century, Tibetan Buddhism from Mongolia reached Turkic population of Tuva, though the first wave of Buddhism had come there from Uigurs in the 9th century
 Like in the Baikal region, it was mainly the Gelug tradition; the Nyingma tradition also spread widely
 The priors of Chadan Khura were given the title of Khambu Lama as leaders of Tuva Buddhism
 Since Tuva, like Mongolia, was under Manchurs’ authority until 1912, the Khambu Lamas of Tuva were subordinate directly to Bogdo Gegens in Urga
 Buddhism in Tuva had significantly closer relations to Mongolia than Buryat Buddhism; besides, it coexisted peacefully with the local tradition of shamanism
 People came to see shamans on certain cases while consulting Buddhist priests on the others
 In the early 17th century, the ancestors of Kalmyks separated from the Oirats of Dzungaria and migrated to the region between the Volga and the Don River, north to the Caspian Sea
 They brought their own tradition of Tibetan Buddhism with them
 Namkhai Guiyatso, the Oirat of Zai Pandita, gave them a great help by developing the kalmyk-oirat written language on the base of the Mongolian alphabet
 The leader of Kalmyk Buddhism was appointed by the Russian tsar and was titled Lama of the Kalmyk People
 His residence being located in Astrakhan, he possessed complete independence from the Mongols, Bandido Khambo Lama of Buryats alike
 Kalmyks received spiritual guidance directly from Tibet, and owing to their natural syncretism, they adopted rites of the Sakya and Kagyu traditions as well as the Gelug one, which was the most widely practiced
 Ivolgin datsan, Buryatia, russiaby 1846, 34 datsans had been built in Buryatia
 With much effort and a lot of expenses, Buryats managed to import a vast number of the sacred books from Tibet, China, and Mongolia, and adopted many living practices of both the dominant Gelug and other schools
 In 1869, Buddhists of Tsugol Datsan began studying indo-tibetan medicine under the guidance of Mongolian lama Choi Manramba; presently such studies were initiated in several other places
 Formation of the basic institutions of higher theological education after the Tibetan pattern had been completed in 1876, when a school of Duinkhor Kalachakra was established at Aginsk Datsan
 Book publishing was developing rapidly
 In 1887, there were already 29 publishing houses, which had produced about 2,000 titles in Tibetan and Mongolian before their destruction in the 1930s
 Kalmyk Buddhism of that period had its own story
 After the Kalmyk Khanate elimination in the end of the 18th century, the ‘steppe of Kalmykia’ became another territory of the tsarist Russia, subjected to the military governor of Astrakhan
 According to the Royal Regulation on Governing Kalmyk People legislated in 1834, the Buddhist church was completely under authority of the tsar administration
 It was not long before the revolution of 1917 when the Buddhist family of Russia accepted Tuvinians of the South Siberia, the only Turkic nation confessing Buddhism
 Many temples there had schools for boys to acquire basic religious literacy
 The higher theological education Tuvinians usually obtained in Mongolia
 For promotion in the development of Russia’s international bonds in the East and particularly for establishing direct ties between the tsarist government and theocratic regimes of Mongolia and Tibet, a Buddhist temple was built in St
 Petersburg, the capital of the Russian Empire
 The works were funded by Dalai Lama and donations raised in Buryatia and Kalmykia
 Bogdo Gegen, the head of Mongolian Buddhists, also contributed a significant sum
 An eminent Buryat lama Agvan Dorjiev was in charge of the temple’s establishment and activities
 By 1935, about one third of Buryat datsans was emptied because the clergy had either fled or been repressed
 a year later, 22 of 29 datsans were closed down under the pretext that they were located near the state border, and lamas were expelled, accused of being 'japanese spies' and 'the people's enemies'
 Similar actions were taking place in Kalmykia, as well as in formally independent Tuva
 Khurul, Kalmykia, russiaduring 1917-1937, 79 temples were closed down in Kalmykia
 Shortly after the revolution of 1917, Chore theological academy was eliminated, the other one lasted until 1933
 None of the novitiates remained in khuruls in 1937 as result of so-called ‘systematic struggling for the young generation’
 Since Kalmyk autonomy was abolished in 1943, and the people were deported to Siberia, the existence of temples and Buddhism in Kalmykia was out of the question
 In Tuva, an 'independent' state since 1921, the church at first remained untouched
 In 1928, the national parliament even legislated Buddhism as a state religion
 Perhaps this provoked the devastation to begin in 1929, which was enforced in 1930 by the Communist Party's special resolution on 'the problem of lamas'
 According to the witnesses, lamas were arrested methodically, the top echelon of the clergy at first, then the next 'layer', and so on to the very last
 In Tuva, like in Kalmykia, temples were burnt to ashes
 But while Kalmyks had at least one building unbroken, the stone Princes’ of Tyumen khurul in Khosheut, only the ruins of walls a meter thick of Chadan Khure were left in Tuva
 It was only in 1948 that a new monastery was built in Ivolga, near ulan-ude, the capital of Buryatia, and one of the buildings of Aginsk Datsan near Chita was re-opened
 With the beginning of perestroika, a great number of Buddhist communities was officially registered under the aegis of the Central Religious Committee of the Buddhists of the USSR
 Restoration of destroyed monasteries started in the Baikal region, Kalmykia, and Tuva, along with building new temples
 St
 Petersburg Datsan was returned to the Buddhist community and renovated
 a Buddhist Institute was opened at Ivolga Datsan
 In Kalmykia 22 temples now
 In Tuve about 16
 In Buryatia more than 30 temples
 Many buddhist center openly in all big city, including Moscow and saint-ptereburg

 The result in all these types of frescoes is more enjoyable especially when the end of that humor completely reverses the target
 tisare prakaar kii shaareerik bhadenti main jis vyakti ke saath vinod kiya jaataa he use puraskaar bhi diya jaataa he jaise, mote vyakti kii god main baraf rakh dene ke pashchaat usapar kisi peya padaarth kii bahumoolya bottle bhi rakh di jaati he or is prakaar drishy main janata ke sahyog kii bhaavana adhik prabal ho jaati he

 There is a philological study composed by Pandit for which he was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award for Gujarati language in 1967
 leth mashin yaa kharad ek masini aujaar he jo aksh ke samamit rachana vaale saamaan banane ke kaam aati he
 In this, the body of metal keeps rotating on an axis and the tools for cutting, piercing and other activities are applied on it and it is given proper shape
 kharad ek aisa yantra he jis par gol anshon ko taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Nothing can be brought into the desired round shape with a hand device
 isliye isko kharad main bandha jaataa he, jo is cheez ko ghumata rahata he
 Then the tool is worked on
 jis mashin se yah sab kaam liya jaataa he usee ko kharad kehete hai
 a simple lathe is shown in the picture
 kharad ke bain ore iskaa shirodand he, jo taiyaar honevaale ang ko pakadaney or ghumaane kaa kaam karata he
 The meridian has a hollow spindle that rotates on two torches
 donon dharukon ke bich main takale par ek pad ghirani hoti he, jisapar praaia: teen pad hote hai, inhen padon se shirodand kii isha kii gati ko badhaayaa or ghataya ja saktaa he
 a similar pulley is also on the axis with which this lathe is driven by the motor
 ghirani ke upar ke patte ko ghirani ke ek pad se sarkaakar duusare pad par laane se kharad kii gati badali jaati he
 On the left edge of the spindle, there are chakras with teeth, which are called teeth
 inke dwaara kharad kii netrubhrami chalaai jaati he
 To cut bangles on a limb, it is necessary to use lead
 or isi se upkaran stambh apane aap chalata he
 The type of bangle to be cut will be used, but the number of bangles per inch will be arranged by denticles
 takale ke daahine kinare par kharad kaa chak hota he
 With this, we catch the thing on which to work
 chak praaia: do prakaar ke hote hai: The posterior instrument is the pillar
 yah stambh upkarnon ko pakadaney or unako thik sthiti main rakhane ke kaam aata he
 It consists of two chakras, which are operated by hand
 ek chakra se stambh ko kharad kii lambaai main chalaaya jaataa he or duusare chakra se upkaran ko kharad kii chaudaai main aage peeche kiya jaataa he
 Therefore the speed of cutting of the tool from the larger wheel and the depth of the cut from the smaller cycle are stabilized
 at: upkaran stambh kaa kaam kisi vastu par thik prakaar kii kaat lagaana he
 On the right side of the lathe there is an appendage, whose job is to aid the corpse; For example, if you have to work on a long object and it is caught only in the wheel, then the object will be bent when it is forced
 isliye aisi vastu ke duusare kinare ke bich chhed banaakar puchhdand ke centre se jamaa dete hai, tab yah vastu is centre par bhi gumti rahati he
 Due to this there is no fear of bending it
 kisi kharad kaa aakaar usapar kaam karanevaale angon ke naam se mana jaataa he
 If we say that the size of the lathe is 12 x 60 inches, it means that the largest function can be tied on this lathe with a diameter of 12 inches and a length of 60 inches
 is prakaar kii kharad ko falki kharad kaha jaataa he
 If more space is left in the lathe under the chuck of the corpus, due to which a work larger than the size of the lathe can be tied on it, it will be called an interval lathe
 kharad par kisi vastu ko baandhane kii teen reetiyaan hai: Binding the object to the centers of the chuck and the trunk is tightened by making holes between the diameters of the two sides of the object, mounting it at the centers of both punches
 yah kasaav puchhdand ke chakra ko ghumaane se hota he
 The tail can be folded back and forth according to the length of work
 kaam ko chak main bandhna or Tie the work on the mouthpiece
 jaisaa kaam hota he, waisi hi reeti kaa upyog hota he
 Due to the spindle hollow, it is convenient to hold long rods
 puchhdand kaa kaam keval kaam ko sanbhale rakhana hi nahin, balki chhed karnaa or bheetar ke vyas ko bada karnaa bhi he
 Many types of work are done on a lathe
 kisi vastu ko gol karnaa or usko ek vishesh vyas kaa bananaa, chuudi kaatna, kisi vastu par dhalaav bananaa, chote chhedon ko bada karnaa, bheetar ke vyas ko badhanaa tathaa isi prakaar ke anya duusare kaam kiye jate hai
 By first cutting deep on the object, it is kept just a little more than the size
 iske pashchaat kam kaat lekar kaam ko uske thik naap par laayaa jaataa he
 There are different tools for each type of chop
 jis prakaar kaa kaam karnaa ho usee prakaar ke upkaran ko kharid main lagaana padataa he
 The tool for cutting bangles is made of the same form as the bangles
 kharaadein kai prakaar kii hoti hai jinako yahan batalaana kathin he, parantu har kharad ke kaam karne kaa niyam vahi he jo upar batalaaya gaya he
 It is very important to keep some things in mind before working on a lathe
 kharad ko chalaane se pehle usko saaf karnaa or uske sab angon ko tel dena laabhadaayak tathaa aavashyak he
 Every part of the lathe works well by giving oil
 jis vastu par kaam ho rahaa he vah kaat lagane se garam ho jaati he
 If it is not frosted, the appliance will also become hot and its edge will be destroyed
 isse dhaatu ko kaatane main kathinaayee hogi or dhaatu bhi thik nahin cat paaegi
 Therefore, along with cutting the metal, oil is also given to it
 ek to yah tel upkaran ke kaam main suvidha karata he or duusare dhaatu ko thandha rakhata he
 This oil is specially made for this purpose
 is kaary ke liye sabun ko pani main gholkar bhi kam main laayaa jaataa he
 It has also been observed that some of the cloth of the worker working on the lathe got stuck in some moving part of the lathe and due to this an accident occurred
 isliye deele kapade pahanakar kharad par kaam karnaa thik nahin he
 It is also necessary to put a restriction on all the parts of the lathe
 dhaatu kaatanevaale sab upkarnon ko tej karte rahane se acha kaam hota he
 By taking fewer deep and short cuts, the metaphor of the work is good
 kuch kaarkaanon main kharaadon ko chalaane ke liye upar kii ore ek dhuree lagaai jaati thi, jisko ingine se chalaaya jaataa tha
 Many pulleys were placed on this axis and a lathe was run from each pulley
 is pranali ke upyog se kai kathinaaiyaan hoti thim, ek to yah ki yadi ek yaa do kharaadein chalaanaa ho to bhi usee shakti kaa ingine chalaanaa padataa tha jo sab kharaadon ko ek saath chalaane ke liye prayukt hota
 This cost more to run the lathes
 duusare, yadi ingine main koi kharabi aa gai to sab kharaadon kaa kaam ruk jaataa tha
 Thirdly, it also led to more accidents
 isliye aajkal is pranali kaa prayog nahin kiya jaataa
 Now with each lathe comes its own motor, which is driven whenever necessary
 is prakaar har kharad kii shakti uske saath alag rahati he

 kyonki yah samooh, kai avasthaaon main bana, isaliye isaki nirmaan-samaapti tithi main kai bhinnataayen hai
 This is because there are many different views of perfection
 udhaahrantah mukhya makbara 1643 main purna hua tha, kintu shesh samooh imaaraten banati raheen
 Similarly, there are also variations in its manufacturing price, as the time gap in fixing its price has made a difference

 It was a unique two-stroke and two silencer motorcycle with all its parts covered
 isaki sabase badi visheshta yah thi ki iske kik starter se hi giyar badalane kaa kaam ho jaataa tha
 Apart from this, its maintenance was also very cheap and easy
 amuman ise kisi motor makenic ke paas le jane kii jarurat hi nahin padati thi

 vikarabad bharat ke telugana rajya kaa ek zila he
 Pangea, Pangea or Pangea, was a vast unified continent that existed during the Paleozoic and Mizozoic eras around 250 million years ago; The present continent has come out of this in its present form
 yah naam alfred vegener ke mahadwipiya pravaah ke siddhant kii vaigyanik charchaa main gadha gaya tha
 In his book, "the Origin of Continents and Oceans", he considered that all continents were part of a vast continent at one time, which he called "the continent", before subsequently disintegrating and flowing to their present places
 panzia shabd 1928 main alfred vegener ke siddhant par charchaa ke liye yojit ek sangoshtee ke dauraan prakaash main aayaa
 a large ocean that surrounded Pangea was named Panthalasa accordingly

 The exact configuration and geodynamics history of Rodinia is not as well understood as that of Panotia and Pangea
 When the fragmentation of Rodinia occurred, it was divided into three pieces: the vast continent of proto-lauresia, the vast continent of proto-gondwana, and relatively Small Congo Cretan
 proto-lauresia and proto-gondwanaland were separated by the proto-tethys Ocean
 proto-loresia ke swayan vibhajit hokar alag-alag hone ke turant baad laurenshia, siberia or baltic mahadwipon kaa nirmaan hua
 Its rift also created two new oceans, the Iapetus Ocean and the Paleocean Ocean
 baltic laurenshia ke purv main or siberia laurenshia ke uttar-purv main sthit tha
 Around 600 ma, most of these oceans came back together to form Panotia, a relatively short giant continent consisting of a large amount of land near the poles and just a relatively small strip connecting the polar oceans near the equator
 isaki utpatti ke keval 60 million varsh ke baad, lagbhag 540 eme, cambrian yug kii shuruyaat ke kareeb panotia phir se vikhandit ho gaya jisase laurenshia, baltic or gondvanaa ke dakshini vishaal mahadweep kaa janm hua
 In the Cambrian period, the independent continent of Laurentia, which became North America, became located on the equator with delimited oceans bounded on three sides: the Panthalassic Ocean to the north and west, the Ipitus Ocean to the south and the Khanty Ocean to the east
 Around 480 MA in the oldest Ordovician, the small continent of Avalonia, a part of land that formed the northeastern United States, Nova Scotia, and England, was liberated from Gondwana and began its journey towards Laurentia
 baltic, laurenshia or evalonia sabhi ordovisian kaal ke ant tak ek saath mil gaye or is tarah ipitas mahaasaagar ke nikat ek chote mahadweep kaa nirmaan hua jise uramerica yaa loresia kaha gaya
 The North Appalachians also originated as a result of the collision
 Siberia is located near Euramerica with the Khanty Ocean between the two continents
 jab ye sabhi ghatnaayen ho rahi thim, gondvanaa dhire-dhire dakshini dhruv kii ore khisak gaya
 This was the first phase of Pangea's origin
 panzia kii utpatti kaa doosraa charan tha gondvanaa ke saath uramerica kii takkar
 silurian kaal tak, 440 eme, baltic ne pehle hi laurenshia se takaraakar uramerica kaa nirmaan kar diya tha
 Avalonia had not yet collided with Laurentia, and a remnant of the Ipitus Ocean, a sea route between them, was still shrinking as Avalonia slowly slid towards Laurentia
 is bich dakshini europe gondvanaa se khandit ho gaya or navgathit rek mahaasaagar ke paar uramerica kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya or devonian main dakshini baltic se takaraa gaya, haalanki yah chota mahadweep pani ke neeche kii ek pattee ke rup main tha
 The Khanty Ocean, a branch of the Ipitus Ocean, was also shrinking from Siberia as an island island that collided with the eastern Baltic
 is dweepiya vrutt ke peeche ek nayaa sagar, ural mahaasaagar maujuud tha
 Towards the end of the Silurian period North and South China moved away from Gondwana and began to move northward across the shrinking proto-tethys Ocean, with the new paleo-tethys Ocean opening at its southern tip
 devonian kaal main gondvanaa swayan uramerica kii ore badhane laga tha jiske kaaran rek mahaasaagar sikud rahaa tha
 In the early Carboniferous era, northwest Africa touched the southeastern coast of Euramerica, starting to form the Appalachian Mountains and the southern parts of the Meseta Mountains
 dakshini america uttar disha main dakshini uramerica kii ore bad gaya tha jabaki gondvanaa ke purvi bhaag bumadhya rekha se dakshini dhruv kii ore badhane lage the
 North China and Southern China were located on independent continents
 chota mahadweep kazakhstania madhya carbonipheras yug main siberia se takaraa gaya tha
 Western Kazakhstania collided with the Baltic at the end of the Carboniferous Era, causing them to cease contact with the Ural Ocean and causing them to originate in the western proto-tethys Ural mountains and the vast continent Lauresia
 This was the last stage of Pangea's origin
 is bich dakshini america dakshini laurenshia se takaraa gaya tha jisase rek mahaasaagar kaa rasta band ho gaya tha or epalachiyans evam auchita parvaton ke sabase dakshini hisse kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 By this time Gondwana was located near the South Pole and glaciers were formed in Antarctica, India, Australia, South Africa, and South America
 uttari china kaa hissaa carbonipheras yug ke ant tak siberia se takaraa gaya tha or is tarah proto-tethis mahaasaagar puri tarah se band ho gaya tha
 At the beginning of the Permian era, the Cimmerian Plate split off from Gondwana and began to move towards Lauresia, creating a new ocean, the Tethys Ocean at its southern tip, and closing the path to the plato-tethys Ocean
 zyaadaatar bhu-bhaag abhi bhi ekikrut hi tha
 In the Triassic period, Pangea moved slightly in the southwest direction
 cimerian plate ab bhi sikudte peleo-tethis ke paar ja rahi thi jo jurassic kaal ke madhya tak jari rahaa
 peleo-tethis pashchim se purv tak band ho gaya tha or is tarah cimerian orogeni kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 Pangea looked like the letter "C" in English, which contained an ocean, the new Tethys Ocean, inside the Sea
 jurassic kaal ke madhya tak panzia main daraar pad gayi thi, iske vikhandan kaa vivaran neeche diya gaya he
 Fossil-evidence of Pangea includes the presence of similar and integral species found on continents that have now gone far
 udhaaharan ke liye, therapcid listrosoras ke jeevashm dakshin africa, bharat or australia main glosopteris flora ke sadasyon ke saath-saath paae jate hai jinka vistaar dhruviya vrutt se lekar bumadhya rekha tak hua hoga, agar mahadweep apni vartmaan sthitiyon main rahe honge; isi tarah mithe pani ke sarisrup mizosoras keval brazil or pashchimi africa ke taton ke sthaneey kshetron main paae jate hai
 Additional evidence of Pangea is found in the geology of the adjacent continents, including the matching of geological trends between the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa
 carbonipheras kaal ke dhruviya barf kii parat ne panzia ke dakshini chor ko dhank liya tha
 Especially glacial collections and structures dating back to the same era are found on many different continents that may have been together in the Pangea continent
 dhruviya vichlan ke spasht margon kaa peleomagnetic adhyayan vishaal-mahadweep ke siddhant kaa bhi samarthan karata he
 Geologists can determine the movement of continental plates by examining the orientation of magnetic minerals in rocks; When rocks are formed, they absorb the magnetic properties of the Earth and indicate in which direction the poles are present relative to the rock
 chunki aavarti dhruvon kii ore chumbakeey dhruvon kaa jhukaav keval kuch hajaar varshon kii avadhi main hota he, ek spasht ausat dhruviya sthiti nirdhaarit karne ke liye kai hajaar varshon ke kai lava se maapan kaa ausat nikaala jaataa he
 Samples of sedimentary rocks and intrusive igneous rocks have a magnetic tilt which is usually an average of these 'similar shifts' in magnetic northward tilt as their magnetic fields do not immediately form as in the frosting lava
 Happens in the case

 The continuity of mountain ranges also provide evidence for Pangea
 iskaa ek udhaaharan epalchian parvat shrinkhalaa he jo purvottar sanyukt rajya america se lekar ireland, britain, greenland or scandinavia ke calladonids tak faili hui he
 Pangea had three major phases of fragmentation
 pehla charan praarambhik-madhya jurassic kaal main shuru hua tha jab panzia purv main tethis mahaasaagar se or pashchim main prashanth mahaasaagar se alag hona shuru hua, jisase antat vishaal mahadwipon loresia or gondvanaa kaa vikaas hua
 The rift that began to form between North America and Africa gave rise to many failed cracks
 a rift resulted in the creation of a new ocean, the North Atlantic Ocean
 atlantic mahaasaagar ek samaan rup se nahin khulaa tha; uttar-madhya atlantic main daraar bananaa shuru hua tha
 The South Atlantic did not open until the Cretaceous
 loresia ne dakshinavart main ghoomana shuru kar diya tha, yah uttar main uttar america evam dakshin main uresia kii ore bad gaya
 The path of the Tethys Ocean was also closed due to the rise of Lauresia in a clockwise direction
 isi bich africa ke duusari taraf purvi africa, antarctic or madagascar ke nikatavarti hashiyon ke saath ek nayaa daraar bhi bananaa shuru ho gaya tha jisase dakshin-pashchimi hind mahaasaagar kii utpatti hui, yah bhi criteshas main khul rahaa tha
 The second important phase of the fragmentation of Pangea began in the early Cretaceous period, when the small giant continent Gondwana split into several continents
 lagbhag 200 eme main simriya mahadweep upar varnit ke anusaar uresia se takaraa gaya 
 haalanki simriya ke takaraane ke saath hi ek sabadakshan kshetra nirmit ho gaya tha
 This subduction zone was called the Tethyan Trench
 yah samudri khai sambhawatah tethian mid-oshan rij ke rup main upashakhit ho gaya tha, yah rij tethis mahaasaagar ke vistaar ke liye jimmedaar tha
 This probably caused the northward movement of Africa, India and Australia
 praarambhik kriteshs kaal main atlantic jo aaj kaa dakshin america or africa he, antat purvi gondvanaa se alag ho gaya tha jisase "dakshin bhartiya mahaasaagar" kaa rasta khul gaya tha
 In the Middle Cretaceous period, Gondwana disintegrated and opened the way to the South Atlantic Ocean as South America began to move away from Africa to the west
 dakshin atlantic ek samaan rup se viksit nahin hua tha; balki yah uttar se dakshin kii ore daraar ke rup main bana tha
 Also Madagascar and India began to break away from the Antarctic at the same time and move northward, opening the way to the Indian Ocean
 madagascar or bharat criteshas kaal ke ant main 100-90 eme main ek duusare se alag ho gaye the
 India continued northward towards Eurasia at a speed of 15 cm per year and closed the Tethys Ocean, while Madagascar stayed there and settled in the African Plate
 newjiland, new calladonia or jeelandia kaa shesh bhaag australia se alag hone laga tha or prashanth kii disha main purv kii ore bad rahaa tha or isane coral sagar or tasman sagar kaa rasta khol diya tha
 The third important and final phase of the fragmentation of Pangea was completed in the early Sinozoic era
 loresia us samay alag hua jab uttar america / greenland uresia se mukt ho gaya or lagbhag 60-55 eme main isane norway ke sagar kaa maarg khol diya
 atlantic or hind mahaasaagar kaa vistaar hona jari rahaa or tethis mahaasaagar kaa maarg band ho gaya
 Meanwhile Australia split from the Antarctic and moved rapidly northward, just as India did more than 40 million years ago and is currently in a collision situation with East Asia
 australia or bharat donon is samay prati varsh 5-6 centimetre kii gati se purvottar disha main bad rahe hai
 The Antarctic has been in or near the South Pole since the origin of Pangea in about 280 MA
 bharat takreeban 35 eme kii shuruyaat main asia se takaraane laga tha jisase himalay kii orogeni kaa nirmaan hua or tethis kaa samudri maarg bhi antat band ho gaya; yah takkar aaj bhi jari he
 The African plate began to change its directions from west to northwest toward Europe and South America began to move northward, separating it from Antarctica and for the first time the entire ocean circulation around the Antarctic
 , Due to which the continent began to cool down rapidly and glaciers were formed
 Other significant events during the Sinozoic era included the opening of the Gulf of California, the rise of the Alps, and the formation of the Japanese sea

 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a novel written in 1865 by British writer Charles Lutwig Dodgson under the surname of Lewis Carroll
 isamen elice naam kii ek ladki kii kahani he jo ek khargosh kii maand main girakar, ajeeb or maanav-sadrush jeevon kii aabaadi vaale ek kalpana lok main pahunch jaati he
 This story is filled with hints of Dodgson's friends
 is kahani ne tark ko jis tareeke se pesh kiya he usne is kahani ko vayaskon ke saath-saath bacchon ke bich bhi sthaayee lokapriyata di
 It is considered one of the best examples of the "literary nonsense" genre, and its narrative path and structure have been quite influential, especially in the fantasy genre
 elice ko us ghatana ke thik teen saal baad 1865 main likhaa gaya tha, jab reverend charles lutwig dodson or reverend robinsan dakworth ne, teen choti ladakiyon ke saath thames nadi main ek naav par saiyr kii: The three girls were daughters of the Chancellor of the University of Oxford and Dean of Christ Church as well as the Headmaster of Westminster School, Henry George Liddell

 It is believed that at Ripon Cathedral, where Carroll's father was a canon, a carving of the griffon and rabbit provided inspiration for the story
 yah safar, oxford ke nikat fauli brij par shuru hua tha or paanch mile dur godsto ke gaanv main samaapt hua
 To spend time, Reverend Dodgson told the girls a story, which, not coincidentally, involves a high-minded girl named Alice who sets off in search of adventure
 ladakiyon ko yah pasand aayaa or elice lidele ne dodson se use uske liye likhane ke liye kaha
 ek lambii deree ke baad - do saal se adhik - unhone antat aisa kiya or 26 navambar 1864 ko elice ko alises adventures under ground kii hastlikhit pandulipi di, jisamen khud dodson ke banaae chitra the
 Martin Gardner, including some, suspects that there was also an earlier version that was later destroyed by Dodgson himself, when he printed a more detailed copy by hand, but there is no known evidence to support it at first sight
 lekin elice ke apni prati praapt karne se pehle hi, dodson iske prakaashan or 15,500 shabdon kii mul kahani ko 27,500 shabdon main vistrut karne kii taiyaari kar rahe the, sabase ullekhneey rup se cheshair cat or mad tii-party ke bare main kadiyon ko jodne se sambadhit

 Of course, the most famous utterance was spoken when the Queen of Hearts shouted "off with every head!" On alice Perhaps Carroll here imprinted a scene from Shakespeare "richard III" when Richard yells "of with his head!", Demanding Lord Hastings' death sentence
 When Alice began to grow tall after eating a cake with the words "eat Me", she says "kurioser and kurioser", a famous line still used today to describe an event with extraordinary surprise
 cheshair cat elice ko pushti detii he "ham sab yahaan pagal hai", ek line jise parinamswaroop kai varshon tak doharaaya gaya
 == Symbolism in the Text == === Mathematics === Since Carroll was a mathematician Christ Church, it was suggested: Citing the book Template: News citing the fact that both this story and "through the Looking Glass" Has many reference and mathematical concepts; Examples include: * In chapter 1, "under the rabbit's den", in the midst of shrinking, Ellis philosophically thinks of her final shape, perhaps "flipping out completely like a candle," "; This idea reflects the concept of boundary
 * adhyay 2 main, "aansu kaa talab" elice guna karne kii koshish karti he lekin kuch ajeeb parinaam nikaalati he:""mujhe dekhne do: chaar baar paanch baarah he or chaar baar chah teraa he or chaar baar saat, oh priy! main is dar se kabhi bees tak nahin pahunch paaungi!"" isse sankhya ke pratinidhitiv kii padtaal kii gai he jiske liye upyog kiya gaya vibhinn aadhaar or sthetiya ank pranali 
 * adhyay 5 main, "caterpillar kii salaah", kabutar kahata he ki choti ladkiyaan saanp kii tarah hai, kyonki choti ladkiyaan or saanp, donon hi andey khate hai
 This common notion of abstraction is widespread in many fields of science, an example of this argument being adopted in mathematics is the substitution of variables
 * adhyay 7 main, "ek pagal chaay party", march hair, mad hatter or dormause, kai udhaaharan dete hai jisamen ek vaakya "A" kaa arth mulya kanvars ke "A" ke baraabar nahin he ; tarkshastra or ganit main, yah ek vyutkram sambandh kii charchaa karnaa he
 * Also in Chapter 7, Ellis ponders what this means when changing seats around the round table makes them initially fall behind
 yah purnank modulo n ke ring par yoga kaa ek nirikshan he
 * The Cheshire Cat fades away until she disappears completely, leaving only her wide laugh, which remains in the air, to Alice's surprise and she says that she smiled a cat without smiling
 Not seen, but never a grin without a cat
 avadharanaon pruthakkaran jab dodson likh rahe the, us vakt ganit par haaavee ho rahaa tha
 Dodgson's depiction of the relationship between cat and grin can be understood as a representation of the basic concept of mathematics and number
 udhaaharan ke liye, do yaa teen seb par vichaar karne ke bajaay koi vyakti aasaani se 'seb' kii avadharana par vichaar kar saktaa he jis par 'do' or 'teen' kii avadharanaen nirbhar lagati hai
 However, a more sophisticated leap is to consider the concept of 'two' and 'three' by themselves, quite like a grin, radically dependent on the cat, conceptually different from its physical goal
 === french bhashaa === kai logon ne yah suzav diya he, martin gardenar or selvin gudekar sahit ki dodson kii french bhashaa main ruchi thi, jinhone kahani main iske bare main sandarbh or shlesh prastut kiye hai
 It is quite likely that they refer to French education, which was part of a Victorian period raising middle-class girls
 udhaaharan ke liye, duusare adhyay main, elice maanati he ki mouse zarur french hoga or usase apane french pustak ke paath kaa pehla vaakya bolti he: "où est ma chatte?" 
 henry beau ke french anuwaad main, elice maanati he ki mouse zarur italvi he or usase italvi main bolti he
 === Classical Languages === In the second chapter, Ellis initially addresses the mouse as "O mouse", the Declaration book based on the noun's own vague memory: "a rat - of a rat - for a rat - a mouse - o Mice! " This corresponds to the traditional order that Byzantine grammarians established for the five distinctions of classical Greek; Due to the lack of Panchami inflection, which is not found in Greek but is found in Latin, the reference is apparently not from the latter as some believe
 === aitihaasik sandarbh === aathven adhyay main, teen card, gulab vriksh par laal gulab chitrakaari kar rahe hai, kyonki unhone galati se ek safed gulab kaa ped laga diya jo queen of hearts ko pasand nahin he
