 The word Sabad or Hindi has been used extensively in the saint literature of Hindi
 badthwaal ne garibadas ke aadhaar par likhaa he ki "shabd, guru kii shiksha, sichan, patola, kuchi, baan, musk, nirbhayavanee, anhad vaani, shabdabrahm or paramatma ke rup main prayukt hua he" "sabad" or "words" are often lyrical
 at: raag raaginiyon main bandhe par "sabad" yaa shabd kehete jate rahe hai
 From siddhas to nirguni, sagunis, saints or devotees of all sects have entered the various raga raginis
 parantu prayek gey pad sabad nahin kaha jaataa
 The feeling of saints is called "sabad"
 kabir kii rachanaaon main "sabad" kaa bahut prayog hua he or bhinn bhinn arthon main hua he
 Hazariprasad Dwivedi has written in his treatise titled "adikal of Hindi literature", collected from a copy written in Samvat 1715 and quoted in Gorakhbani as "sabdi"
 kabir ne sambhavat: vahiin se "sabad" grahan kiya hoga
 " naathon kaa vyapak prabhaav keval unke mat yaa vichaaron tak hi simit nahin rahaa, unki abhivyakti ke vividh prakaaron ne bhi unke parvarti hindi santon ko prabhavit kiya he
 The saints often adopt the style of sentiment prevalent in the public and the language so that their thoughts can be transmitted in it soon
 It was only natural if the Naths took the "sabad" or verse style from the Siddhas and various sect saints from the Naths
 
 nirguni santon ke "saakhi" or "sabad" atyadhik prachlit hue
 Many times these two words were used as synonyms of each other
 badthwaal kaa mat he ki "vishay kii drushti se in donon main bahudhaa kuch antar lakshith hota he
 "sabad" is used for personalization of inner and experience pleasure, and sakhi is used to explain the practical experience to be targeted in daily life
 " iskaa arth yah hua ki "sabad" aatmanubhuti he or saakhi bahyanubhuti
 But this distinction of "sakhi" and "sabad" is not always reflected by the practice of saint
 swayan badthwaal ne bhi ek sthal par sweekaar kiya ki "kabhi kabhi inamen se ek duusare kii jagah bhi vyavahrut hua dekha jaataa he
 "one thing is certain with regard to Sabad that it has been an old practice to say them in raga raginis
 isi se kabari ke "sabad" vishyon ke anusaar vibhajit na hokar raag raaginiyon ke anusaar adhik vibhajit paae jate hai

 Panditji's reasoning power was amazing
 aapse ek baar kisi ne prashn kiya kii hindu itani badi sankhya main muslmaan kaise ho gaye
 Give your seven reasons
 1
 muslmaan akraman main balatpurvak musalmaan banaaya gaya 2
 During the Muslim rule, many reputed Hindus were converted into Muslims by giving them land, land and land
 3
 islamic kaal main urdu, farsi kii shiksha evam sanskrit kii durgati ke kaaran bane 4
 Due to non-remarriage among Hindus and the prohibition of the practice of Sati, Hindu women graced the house of a Muslim and if a Hindu youth had a relationship with a Muslim woman, he was cast out of caste and converted to Muslim
 5
 murtipuja kii kuriti ke kaaran kai hindu vidharmee bane 6
 Muslim prostitutes implicated many Hindus to become Muslims 7
 vaidic dharm kaa prachaar na hone ke kaaran muslmaan bane
 If thought deeply, Panditji has told the Hindus the measures to protect the caste, if the Hindus will improve even if they do not improve now

 Islam believers consider Muhammad Sahib as the last prophet, Mirza proclaimed himself to be Krishna, sometimes Nanak, sometimes Jesus and sometimes the last prophet of Islam, and to beat his new religion, he began to beat the drum of new prophets and Ilhamo
 
 ek udahaaran mirza dwaara likhit pustak “vahi hamaara krishna ” se lete hai is pustak main likhaa hai – usne hinduon kii unnati or sudhar ke liye nishkalanki avatar ko bhej diya hai jo thik us yug main aayaa hai jis yug kii krishna ji ne pahile se soochna de rakhi hai
 The name of that flawless avatar is Mirza Ghulam Ahmed, who has appeared in Kadian district Gurdaspur
 khuda ne unke haath par sahastro nishaan dikhye hai
 Those who lie on them are spared by God
 unki prarthanaae sunata hai or unki sifarish par logo ke cast dur karata hai
 Gives prestige
 aapako chahie kii unki shikshaao ko pard kar nur praapt kare
 yadi koi andeh ho to paramatma se prarthana kare kii he parameshwar? yadi yah vyakti jo teri or se hone kii ghoshnaa karata hai or apane aapako nishkalank avatar kahata hai

par pandit ji apni dhun ke pakke the mirza gulam ahamed kii kothi par kaadiyaan pahunch gaye
 Panditji remained in Qadian for two months but Mirza Ghulam Ahmed could not show any miracle
 is khij se aryasamaj or pandit lekharam ko apana kattar dushman maanakar mirza ne aryasamaj ke viruddh dushprachaar aarambh kar diya
 Mirza printed a book called Brahin Ahmedia by asking for donations
 Pandit ji gave his answer in writing to Takzib Brahin Ahmedia
 mirza ne suramaaye chashme aryaa likhaa jiskaa pandit ji ne uttar nuskhaaye khabte ahmadiya likh kar diya
 mirza ne suramaaye chashme aryaa main yah bhavishyavaanee kari kii ek varsh ke bheetar pandit ji kii maut ho jaaegi

 However, once the detailed information on the murder-suicide became clear, the WWE quickly and quietly began to remove itself from their merchandise and stop mentioning them
 17 july 2007, ko jari kii gai vish vidya report se pataa chalaa ki maut ke samay, nancy ke sharir main teen prakaar ke drug the: ksenaks, hydrocodon, tathaa hydromorphone or teenon hi vifaille str par nahin balki upachaaratmak str par paae gaye
 {0} Xenax { / 0} was found in Daniel's body, which led the chief medical examiner to believe that he was given a sedative before killing him
 benoit ke sharir main ksenaks, hydrocodon or vrishani kaa ek unchaa str paaya gaya, jo ki unke system main hormone ke ek kritrim rup ke kaaran hua
 The chief medical examiner attributed the cause of the testicular level, possibly to Benoit's ongoing treatment for incompleteness caused by previous chemical-specific misuse or testicular deficiency
 No symptoms were found to prove that his body was contributing to Benoit's violent behavior, which resulted in murder-suicide and concluded that no "physical indignation" was involved
 hatya-aatmahatya se pehle, benoit ko avaidh rasaynic vishesh die gaye the, jo farvari 2006 main chal rahe dablyu dablyu i ke tallent vailanes kaarykram ke anuroop nahin tha
 Benoit received nandrolone and anastrozole
 rasaynic vishesh durupyog kii jaanch ke dauraan yah pataa chalaa ki anya pahalawaanon ko bhi rasaynic vishesh die gaye the
 Following the double murder-suicide, former wrestler Christopher Nowinski contacted Chris Benoit's father, Michael Benoit, and said that he would have taken this step because of years of trauma to his son's brain
 pashchim varjeenia vishvavidhyalay main neurosurgery ke pramukh, julian belz ne benoit ke dimag par pareekshan kiye or parinaamon main yah dikhaai diya ki "benoit kaa dimag itani buree tarah se kshatigrast ho gaya hua tha ki vah ek 85 saal ke alzimer ke mariz ke dimag ke jaisaa lagata tha
 "it was reported that he suffered from an advance of insanity, similar to the brains of four retired NFL players who suffered from multiple strokes, drowned in depression, and harmed themselves or others
 belz or unke sahyogiyon ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki punaravarti mastishkaghat paagalpan kii ore le kar ja saktaa he, jo gambhir swabhaavajnya samasyaon main yogadan de saktaa he
 Benoit's father suggested that brain damage may be the leading cause of the crime
 unhone yah bhi pushti kii ki unke bete kaa dah sanskaar chupchaap kiya gaya tha, lekin unki asthiyon ke saath kya kiya gaya yah janata kii jaankaree se baahar he

 asthisushirta yaa osteoporosis haddi kaa ek rog he jisase fracture kaa khatara bad jaataa he
 In osteoporosis, bone mineral density is reduced, bone micro-structures are disintegrated, and the amount and variety of non-stored proteins in bone is altered

 Osteoporosis is most common in post-menopausal women, when it is called post-menopausal osteoporosis, but it can also develop in men and can be caused by specific hormonal disorders and other chronic illnesses in anyone or drugs, especially glucocorticoids
 Can result when the disease is steroid or glucocorticoid-induced osteoporos Number called

 asthishoshak koshikaon dwaara asthi kaa avasorana hota he, jiske baad nai asthi asthikorak koshikaon dwaara jamaa kii jaati he
 The three major mechanisms by which bone weakness develops are insufficient head bone mass, excessive bone absorption, and insufficient formation of new bone during regeneration
 At the core of delicate bone tissue development is the interaction of these three mechanisms
 Hormonal factors specifically determine the rate of bone absorption; Estrogen deficiency increases bone resorption and, at the same time, reduces the deposition of new bone, usually in weight-bearing bones
 is prakriya ko dabaane ke liye apekshit estrogen kii maatra, aam taur par garbhashay or stan granthi ko uttejit karne ke liye apekshit maatra se kam he
 The estrogen receptor of the α-form seems to be very important in the regulation of bone manipulation

 The role of calcitonin, a hormone produced by the thyroid that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not as important as PTH
 asthishoshkon ke sakriyakaran vibhinn aanvik sanketon dwaara niyantrit hai, jinamein se RANKL par sarvaadhik adhyayan kiya gaya he

 RANKL, RANK and OPG are closely related to tumor necrosis factor and its receptors
 Wnt sanketan maarg kii bhoomika ko sweekruti mili he, par acchhee tarah se kam samajha gaya he
 Local production of eicosanoids and interleukin is thought to be involved in controlling bone manipulation and may be the over or under-production factor of these mediators at the core of the development of osteoporosis
 bandhakmay asthi, lambii asthiyon or kasheruk ke chor par sthit spanjanuma asthi he
 The vulvascular bone is the rigid outer shell of the bones and the middle of the long bones
 kyonki asthikorak or asthishoshak, haddiyon kii sataha par nivas karte hai, bandhakmay asthi zyaada sakriy he or asthi ke her-pher or punarpratirupan ke adheen he
 Not only is bone density low, but bone micro-structures are disrupted
 bandhakmay asthi kamazor conticaayen bhang ho jaati hai or kamazor haddiyon se pratisthapit hoti hai
 Common osteoporotic fracture sites, such as the wrist, hip and spinal cord, have a relatively high ratio of vulvar bone to ligamentous bone

 Osteoporosis has no specific symptoms of its own; The main consequence of this is the increased risk of fractures
 osteoporotic fracture un sthitiyon main hote hai, jahaan aam taur par swasth logon kii haddi nahin tuutati he; atah unhen najuk asthi-bhang mana jaataa hai
 Typical delicate fractures occur in the vertebral column, rib, hip, and wrist

 dawa kaa prayog saidhantik rup se parivartaneey he, haalanki kai maamalon main osteoporosis ke jokhim ko badhaane vaali dawaaon kaa upyog aprihaary he
 The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are advanced age and female gender; Estrogen deficiency after menopause correlates with a rapid decrease in bone mineral density, whereas a decrease in testosterone levels in men has a comparable effect
 haalanki osteoporosis sabhi jaateey samoohon ke logon main paaya jaataa he, europea yaa asian mul ke log osteoporosis ke prati pehle se hi pravrutt hai
 People who have a family history of fractures or osteoporosis are at greater risk; The heritability of fractures and low bone mineral density is relatively high, with an expansion ranging from 25 to 80 percent
 osteoporosis ke vikaas se jude kam se kam 30 jin maujuud hai
 People who have already had a fracture are twice as likely to have a fracture again than someone who is same or gay

 Osteoporosis is diagnosed by measuring bone mineral density
 dohari urja eks-re avasoranamapi sarvaadhik prachlit vidhi he
 In addition to detecting abnormal BMD, a diagnosis of osteoporosis requires investigation into potentially variable underlying causes; This can be done with blood tests and X-rays

 Oral bisphosphonates are relatively poorly absorbed and therefore should be taken on an empty stomach, where no food or drink is taken for the next 30 minutes
 It is associated with inflammation of the esophagus and is therefore sometimes tolerated; a weekly or monthly dose reduces the likelihood of esophagitis and is now standardized
 haalanki zolandronet jaise antahshira nuskhon ke saath aantrayik khuraaq maukhik sahishnutaa kii samasyaon kaa parihaar hota he, lekin ye kaarak jabade kaa asthigalan naamak ek durlabh lekin apriy mukh-rog main pradhan rup se antargrast hai
 For this reason, oral bisphosphonate therapy should probably be preferred and now doctors recommend that any curative dental work be done before treatment
 haal hi main, terriparatide ko osteoporosis ke prati prabhavi hona paaya gaya he
 It acts as a parathyroid hormone and stimulates osteoblasts and thus increases their activity
 yah zyaadaatar haddiyon kii kamazori se pusht rogiyon ke liye, visheshtah kam BMD yaa kai fracture ke jokhim kaarak vaale yaa jo maukhik biophasphonet bardaasht nahin kar sakate, istemaal kiya jaataa he

 Studies have noted a slight increase in the risk of venous thrombosis, the cause of which has not been determined
 isse pataa chalata he ki yah alag kaarnon se ghanaastrata ke jokhim se grast rogiyon main kam upyukt ho saktaa he
 The leaching of strontium in place of calcium in the bone matrix indicates a substantial and mismatched increase in bone mineral density measured at DXA, making it difficult to interpret the addition of bone density by this method for patients treated with strontium
 ek sudhaar elgoritham taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Although strontium renalate is effective, its use has not yet been approved in the United States
 tathaapi, america main kai nami vitamin nirmaataaon se stronsium citrate uplabdh he
 Most researchers believe that strontium, regardless of its use, is safe and effective
 rinlate prakaar france ke sarvier company dwaara avishkrut keval ek saadhan he, taaki ve stronsium ke apane sanskaran ko patent kar saken
 Strontium, whatever its form, must be soluble in water and ionized in abdominal acid
 Strontium is then protein-bound to be carried by the intestinal tract into the bloodstream
 sodium alendronet jaisi aushadhiyon ke vipareet, stronsium asthi punahchaalan ko baadhit nahin karata or, vastav main, majboot haddiyon kaa utpaadan ho saktaa he
 Studies have shown that alendronate may also be a factor of bone loss after five years, while strontium continues to form bone from application during life
 stronsium ko aahaar yaa calcium yukt vyanjanon ke saath nahin lenaa chahie, kyonki udagrahan ke dauraan calcium kii pratispardhaa stronsium ke saath hoti he
 Nevertheless, it is important to take calcium, magnesium, and vitamin d in therapeutic amounts daily, but not while taking strontium
 Strongium should be taken empty stomach at night

 aahaar kaa seven badhaane ke liye calcium poorak istemaal kiye ja sakate hai or puure din kai choti kuraaken lene ke madhyam se avasorana anukulit kiya ja saktaa he
 The role of calcium in preventing and treating osteoporosis is unclear - some populations with very low calcium levels also have extremely low bone fracture rates and bone mass in others with high rates of calcium ingested through milk and milk products - The rate of dissolution is high
 osteoporosis ke vikaas main kai anya karkon ke bich khaane main calcium ko ek kaarak banaate hue, protein, namak or vitamin d kaa seven, vyaayaam or surya ke prakaash se sampark jaise anya sabhi kaarak, asthi khanij ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 In 2007, a WHO report stated that eating calcium along with acidic adulteration with diet affected bone weakness
 
 a mid-analysis of randomized controlled trials involving calcium and calcium and vitamin d supported the use of high levels of calcium and vitamin D, although the results varied depending on the criteria used to assess bone health
 a mid-analysis with another study supported significantly better outcomes for patients with best adherence to the treatment protocol
 iske vipareet, calcium purakon main unnat ucch lepoprotein kii saghanta kii pichhali report ke baavjood, kii dar main sambhavit vruddhi pai gai
 If confirmed, this indicates that calcium supplementation in women at low risk of fracture may cause more harm than good

 Although osteoporosis patients have an increased mortality due to fracture complications, most patients die with the disease and not because of it
 kulhon ke facture kii vajah se gatishiltaa main kami or kai jatiltaaon kaa ek atirikt jokhim ho saktaa he
 The 6-month mortality rate after hip fracture makes up about 13
