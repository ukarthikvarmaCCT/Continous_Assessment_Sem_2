 South Africa's flourishing domestic Formula One championship lasted from 1960 to full 1975
 The race cars ahead of the series included recently retired cars from the World Championship, though it also included a select few cars with locally manufactured or modified machines

 The DFV helped the UK make possible the domestic Formula One series between 1978 and 1980
 Like South Africa a decade ago, the game here also included second-hand cars from Lotus and Fittipaldi Automotive, although some cars, such as the March 781, were manufactured specifically for the series

 a Formula One Grand Prix event lasts one weekend
 aajkal yah shuukravaar ko do mukt abhyaas satron or shanivaar ko ek mukt abhyaas satr se shuru hota he
 Additional drivers are allowed to drive on Fridays, but only two cars can be used for each team, requiring a race driver to leave their seat
 antim mukt abhyaas satr ke baad ek qualifing satr kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 This session determines the starting sequence of the race
 khel ke itihaas ke adhikansh hisson tak qualifing satr abhyaas satron se thodaa alag tha; driveron ke paas ek puraa satr hota tha jisamen unhen apana sabase tej samay nirdhaarit karne kii koshish kerani padati thi, kabhi-kabhi prayoson kii ek simit sankhya ke bheetar aisa karnaa padataa tha, prayek driver ke sarvshereshth ekal lap, sabase tej se sabase dhimi gati dwaara nirdhaarit grid kram ke saath unhen aisa karnaa padataa tha
 The grid was limited to the fastest 26 cars and drivers had to lap within 107% of the pole sitter to qualify for the race
 anya formeton main shuukravaar kaa pre-qualifing or ve satr shaamil hai jinamein prayek driver ko keval ek qualifing lap or ek purv nirdhaarit kram main alag se chalaane kii anumati di jaati thi
 The current qualifying system was adopted for the 2006 season
 "nock-out" qualifing ke rup main mashhoor is pratiyogita ko teen avadhi main baanta gaya he
 In each period, in an attempt to overtake the next period, drive the car for the qualifying lap, rotate as many laps as he wishes, and at the end of the period the slowest driver was "fired" and his best lap
 Their grid position was determined on the basis of the rounds
 tisare or antim avadhi main pole sthiti ke liye yogyata praapt karne kii koshish karne ke yogya keval 10 kaaron ke bachane tak kaaron ko isi tarah se nikaala jataa he
 All previous trips are rescheduled for each period and only one driver has the most laps count during that period
 maujuuda niyamon ke tahat sabhi avadhiyon ke liye us avadhi ke ant hone kaa sanket dene vaale rangabirange jhande ke girane se pehle shuru hone vaale kisi bhi nirdhaarit lap ko puraa kiya ja saktaa he or isaki ginati us driver ke sthaan ke rup main hogi or tab bhi yadi ve avadhi ke samaapt hone ke baad samaapti rekha ko paar karte hai
 In the first two periods, cars can use any type of tire they wish, and drivers fired in these periods are allowed to change the tires to their liking before the race
 haalanki antim avadhi main bhaag lene vaale kaaron ko qualifing ke ant main apni pasand ke tair ke saath hi res shuru karnaa chahie 
 2010 se reson ke dauraan phir se eendhan bharne kii anumati na hone se antim satr kaa aayojan kam-eendhan vinyas ke saath kiya jaataa he or yogyata kaa nirdhaaran hone ke baad kaaron main phir se eendhan bharaa jaataa he
 For example, for a grid with 20 cars, all 20 cars are allowed to participate in the first period
 avadhi ke ant main, sabase dhime paanch kaaron ko nikaal diya jaataa he or antim paanch grid sthitiyon ko liya jaataa he
 At the end of the second period five more cars are fired and the next five lowest grid positions are taken and the remaining 15 cars participate
 tisare or antim avadhi main, pole sthiti ke liye shesh 10 kaaren pratispardhaa karti hai or 1 se 10 tak kii grid sthitiyon ko bharti hai
 The knock-out format has undergone minor updates since its inception, such as - adjusting the number of drivers in each period due to changes in the total number of cars entered
 res ek varm-ap lap ke saath shuru hota he, jiske baad kaaron ko aarambhik grid par usee kram main ikaitha kiya jaataa he jis kram main unhone qualifi kiya he
 This lap or round is often referred to as the formation circle, because cars rotate the formation without any fast progress
 Warm up laps provide the driver with an opportunity to track and check the condition of their car, the tires themselves to generate some heat to get the much needed traction and stain crews from the grid to their Provides time to clean you and your equipment
 ek baar sabhi car grid par gathit ho chuke ho, to trek ke upar kii ek prakaash vyavastha res ke shuru hone kaa sanket karti he: ek second ke interval par paanch laal battiyaan prakashit hoti hai; uske baad res ke shuru hone kaa sanket dene ke liye ek anirdisht samay ke baad ve sabhi ek saath bujh jaati hai
 The start process can be stopped if a driver stretches his arms and rests on the grid, signaling
 yadi aisa hota he to prakriya phir se shuru hoti he: grid se hamalavar car ko hataane ke saath ek nayaa gathan chakkar shuru hota he
 The race can be resumed in the event of a serious event or dangerous situations by canceling the original start
 res ko sefti car ke peeche se shuru kiya ja saktaa he yadi adhikariyon ko aisa lagata he ki racing kii shuruyaat bahut zyada bhayanak hoga, jaise yadi trek geela ho
 sefti kar ke peeche se res ke shuru hone par koi gathan chakkar nahin hota he
 Under normal circumstances the winner of the race is the same driver who crosses the finish line first after completing a specified number of rounds followed by 260 km for a distance of approximately 305 km )
 Race officials can already finish the race due to unsafe conditions, such as rain, it should be finished within two hours, although only in case of very bad weather the races are likely to last so long
 driver res ke maarg par sthiti ke liye ek duusare se teji se aage nikal sakate hai or unhen usee kram main 'vargeekrut' kiya jaataa he jis kram main ve res ko puraa karte hai
 If a leader accidentally meets a back marker who has completed a few rounds, the back marker is shown a blue flag and is told that he is obliged to allow the leader to overtake himself
 dhimi car ko 'lapd' kaha jaataa he or, ek baar jab leader res ko puraa kar letaa he, to use 'van lap down' res ko puraa karne vaale ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 a driver can be cycled several times in front of any car
 jo driver, yantric samasyaon, durghatana, yaa kisi anya kaaran se res ko puraa kar paane main asafal ho jaataa he, use res se nikal jane ke liye kaha jaataa he or parinaamon main use 'vargeekrut nahin' kiya jaataa he
 However, if the driver has completed more than 90% of the distance of the race, then he / she will be classified
 puure res bhar main driver tiron ko badalane or nuksaan kii marammat karne ke liye pit stop le sakate hai 
 alag-alag team or driver apane-apan car kii kshamta ko badhaane ke uddeshy se alag-alag pit stop ranneetiyaan apanaate hai
 Combinations of two tires with different durability and adhesion characteristics are available to drivers
 res ke maarg main driveron ko donon kaa istemaal karnaa hota he
 One pair will have a performance advantage over the other and choosing which pair to use is a major strategic decision

 agar barish ke tiron kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, to driveron ko donon shushk tiron main se kisi bhi tair ko istemaal karne ke liye kabhi baadhya nahin kiya jaataa he
 a driver must stop at least once to use both tire pairs; Three pauses are usually taken, although further fixations may need to be taken to correct the damage or, if the weather conditions change
 formula van ke itihaas main res ke formet main thodaa badlaav aayaa he
 The main change revolves around that which is allowed at the pit stop
 grand pricks racing ke shuruaati dinon main, ek driver ko apane team ke saathi ke car main res ko chaalu rakhane kii anumati di jaati thi basharte uski samasya kaa vikaas hua ho; aajkal kaaron ko itnaa dhyanpurvak susajjit kiya jaataa he ki ab aisa hona naammumkin he
 In recent years, attention has been paid to changes in fuel refueling and tire replacement regulations
 2010 ke satr se, phir se eendhan bharne—jise 1994 main phir se shuru kiya gaya tha—kii anumati nahin he, jiskaa uddeshy suraksha ke maamalon ko lekar kam samrik racing ko protsaahit karnaa he
 The rule of both pairs of tires required during the race was implemented in 2007, again to encourage racing on the track

 Several systems have been used since the 1950s to award championship points
 2010 ke anusaar sheersh das kaaron ko ankon se sammanit kiya jaataa he, vijeta ko 25 ank praapt hote hai
 The total number of points gained in each race is added together and the driver and constructor who scores the most points at the end of the season are the world champions
 yadi donon kii ek team ke car ank praapt karke res ko puraa karte hai, to un donon ko constructors championships ank praapt hote hai, jiskaa matlab he ki drivers or constructors championships ke aksar alag-alag parinaam hote hai
 To get points, a driver has to be classified
 thik-thik kaha jaay to vargeekrut hone ke liye driver ko res puraa karne kii jarurat nahin he lekin jeetne vaale driver ke res kii duuri kaa kam se kam 90% puraa karnaa jaruri he
 Therefore, it is possible for a driver to get some points even when he is eliminated from the race before the race ends
 us halaat main jab res ke chakkaron ke 75% se bhi kam duuri tay kii gai ho to driveron or constructaron ko keval aadhe ankon se sammanit kiya jaataa he
 This has happened only five times in the history of the championship, including the last time on the occasion of the 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix when the race was called off after 31 rounds due to torrential rain and the championship winner on at least one occasion
 The decision was made
 ek driver satr ke dauraan team badal saktaa he or pichley team main praapt kisi bhi ank ko apane paas rakh saktaa he
 In 2010, Formula 1 revised its points system and decided to score the first ten drivers instead of eight or six in previous years
 1981 ke baad se formula van ke tiimon ko aisa chasis banane kii jarurat he jisamen ve pratiyogita karte hai or uske baad "team" or "constructor" shabd kamobesh antah parivartaneey ban gaye
 This requirement distinguishes the game from series, such as the indycar series, which allow teams to purchase chassis and "spec series", such as the GP2, which needs to keep all cars in the same specification
 yah prabhavi dhang se privacrs par bhi pratibandh lagaataa he, jo 1970 ke dashak main formula van main bhi bahut aam tha
 The first season of the game 1950 saw eighteen teams competing but due to too much expense many teams exited the competition very soon
 vastav main, formula van ke pehle dashak ke adhikansh samay tak pratispardhi kaaron kaa itnaa zyada abhaav tha ki grid ko bharne ke liye formula tu kaaron ko shaamil kiya gaya
 Ferrari is the only active team that competed in 1950
 praarambhik nirmaataa sahabhaagita "factory team" yaa "works team", jaise - alpha romeo, pheraari, yaa reynolt kii team, ke rup main saamne ai
 vastut: 1980 ke dashak ke shuru tak gaayab hone ke baad, factory kii tiimon ne 1990 or 2000 ke dashakon main vaapasi kii or yaa to apane khud kii tiimon kii sthapana karke yaa maujuuda tiimon ko kharidkar pheraari, jaguaar BMW, reynolt, toyota or honda ke saath grid ke aadhe hisse tak kaa gathan kiya

 Ferrari holds the record for the most constructors' championship wins
 haalaanki 2000 ke dashak ke ant tak factory kii timen ek baar phir se patan ke raste par chalane lage, sirf pheraari, marcedes-benz or reynolt hi 2010 ke championships tak pravishtiyon ko darj karaane main safal hue hai
 Companies, such as Climax, Repco, Cosworth, Hart, Judd and Supertech, which had no direct relationship with the team, often sold engines to teams that could not afford to build them
 praarambhik varshon main swatantra rup se swaamitv vaali formula van timen kabhi-kabhi khud bhi ingine banaati thi, haalanki pramukh car nirmaataaon, jaise - BMW, pheraari, honda, marcedes-benz, reynolt or toyota, kii sahabhaagita main vruddhi hone se yah bahut kam aam ho gaya jinaki badi bajet vaali ingine nijee taur par nirmit injanon ko kam pratispardhi bana detii thim
 Cosworth was the last independent engine supplier, but lost its final customers after the 2006 season
 In early 2007, the manufacturers' sufficient funding and engineering capacity overtook the last independent engine manufacturers
 anumaan he ki pramukh timen keval injanon par prati nirmaataa prati varsh €100 or €200 million ke bich kii raashi kharch kar daalate hai
 In the 2007 season, for the first time since the 1984 rule, two teams used chassis manufactured by other teams
 super aguri ne honda racing RA106 kii ek sanshodhit chasis kaa istemaal karke satr shuru kiya, jabaki scudyria toro roso ne red bul racing RB3 kii ek sanshodhit chasis dwaara istemaal kiya gaya tha) kaa istemaal kiya
 There was nothing to be surprised in this decision as the cost is increasing, the Super Aguri is partially owned by Honda and the Toro Rosso is half owned by Red Bull
 formula van team spiker ne is nirnay ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai or anya tiimon, jaise - maclaren or pheraari, ne aadhikarik taur par is abhiyaan kaa samarthan karne kii pushti kii he
 This use of the chassis of other teams led to the 2006 season being the final season in which the terms "team" and "constructor" were actually interchangeable
 isane 2008 ke satr ke liye F1 ke liye prodrive team ko aakarshith kiya jahaan ise ek graahak car chalaanaa tha
 After not being able to secure a package from mclaren, and after Williams threatened to take legal action against him, Prodrive intended to enter the 2008 season
 ab, lagata he ki 2010 main aupchaarik rup se graahak kaaron par pratibandh lagaaya jayega
 Although teams rarely disclose information about their budgets, it is estimated that the budgets for each of them range from US $ 66 million to US $ 400

 As a result, constructors wishing to enter Formula One often prefer to buy an existing team: Tyr by BAR and Jordan buying by Midland avoid both of these teams from accumulating huge sums and already the team Received a chance to secure the benefits received, such as TV revenue

 Most teams also have an additional driver, whom they bring to race weekends in case the main driver is injured or ill
 sabhi pratiyogiyon ke paas ek FIA super license hona jaruri he
 Each driver is assigned a number
 pichley satr ke champion ko number 1 ke rup main namit kiya jaataa he or saath main uske team-saathi ko number 2 diya jaataa he
 Each team is then ranked according to the position in the Constructors' Championship last season
 number 13 kaa istemaal nahin kiya jaataa he
 There are also some exceptions to this rule, such as in 1993 and 1994, when the current World Drivers' Champion was not competing in Formula One
 is maamle main pichley varsh ke champion ke team ke driveron ko number 0 or 2 die jate hai
 The number 13 has not been used since 1976, before which it was sometimes conferred at the discretion of individual race organizers
 1996 se pehle, keval world championships jeetne vaale driver or uski team aam taur par pichley champion ke saath numberon main pher-badal karte the-shesh ke paas purv varshon ke unke apane number hote the kyonki unhen mul rup se 1974 ke satr ke armbh main nirdhaarit kiya gaya tha
 For many years, for example, Ferrari had the numbers 27 and 28 regardless of their end position at the World Championship

 The British F3 has supplied a number of F1 drivers as well as champions including Nigel Mansell, Ayrton Senna and Mika Häkkinen, who have gone directly from that series to Formula One
 shaayad hi kisi driver ko usase bhi neeche ke str se liya ja saktaa he jaisaa ki 2007 ke world champion kimi racconen ke maamle main hua tha jo formula reynolt se sidhe F1 main chale gaye the

 However, a driver must have a FIA Super License for racing - which ensures that the driver has the requisite skills and therefore will not pose a threat to others
 Some drivers do not have this license when they first sign for an F1 team; Räikkönen was licensed despite only 23 car racing credits

 Other drivers have become pundits of TV coverage, such as Martin Brundle for ITV, Luciano Burti for Globo, Jean Alessi for the Italian national network RAI, and David Colthard for the BBC
 Others, such as Damon Hill and Jackie Stewart, play active roles in motorsport in their respective countries

 Six of the original seven races took place in Europe; The only non-european race that counted like the World Championship in 1950 was the Indianapolis 500, which was later replaced by the United States Grand Prix due to F1's lack of team participation and the need for taxes with specialties different from other races
 F1 championships dhire-dhire anya gaiyr europea deshon main bhi fail gaya
 Argentina hosted the first South American Grand Prix in 1953 and Morocco hosted the first African World Championship race in 1958
 After that, Asia and Oceania also hosted
 The current nineteen races have spread across continents such as Europe, Asia, Oceania, North America and South America

 a typical circuit typically involves a stretch of straight road on which the starting grid is located

 Many other circuits are also fully or partially mounted on public roads, such as spa-francorchamps
 The glamor and history of the Monaco race are the primary reasons why the circuits are still in use because it is believed to have not met the strict safety requirements imposed on other tracks
 teen baar world champion rah chuke nelson picket ne monaco main racing kii vyakhya bade shandaar dhang se nimna rup main kii "yah ek tarah se apane living rup main chaaron taraf cycle kii sawari karne jaisaa tha"
 Circuit designs designed with driver safety in mind are now being refined day by day, a living example being the new Bahrain International Circuit which was incorporated in 2004 and designed by Herman Tilk in a way Like most of the new circuits of F1
 F1 ke nae circuiton main se kai, khaas taur par tilk dwaara dizin kii gaye circuit, kii aalochana main kaha gaya he ki isamen spa-francorchamps or imola jaisi utkrushtataa ke "pravaah" kaa abhaav he
 For the Hockenheim circuit in Germany, for example, many people have resented the design they designed, providing more capacity for the grandstands and eliminating the much longer and dangerous straight path
 Argues that the position of the Hockenheim circuit was elongated, which went directly into the black wooded parts

 3 June 2011 mahaar regiment bhartiya sena kaa ek infantry regiment he
 Although originally it was thought to combine the Mahar soldiers of Maharashtra, it is the only regiment of the Indian Army that is made up of soldiers from all communities and regions of India
 mahaar scouts or unki sena kile main sainikon ke rup main maratha raja shivaji dwaara bhartee kiye gaye the
 They were recruited by the East India Company Company in the sixth part of the Bombay Army to form a large part of the company
 bombay sena unki bahaduree or dhvaj ke prati vafadari ke liye mahaar sainikon isht or isliye bhi kyonki ve angl-maratha yuddh ke dauraan par bharosa kiya ja saktaa he
 They have achieved many successes, including in the Battle of Koregaon, where the Mahar-dominated company troops were defeated under the leadership of a much larger Peshwa Bajirao II
 yah ladaai ek obilisk, koregaanv stambh he, jo bhartiya swatantraaa jab tak mahaar regiment ke shikhar par chapa rup main janaa dwaara manaaya gaya
 The Mahar soldiers of the Bombay Army saw action in the [indian Rebellion of 1857], and joined the two regiments The rebellion under the British war of this regiment is "bolo Hindustan ki Jai"
 vidroh ke baad bhartiya sena ke british adhikariyon, vishesh rup se jo pratham or dwitiya afgaan yuddh main seva kii thi, marshall daud siddhant ke liye mudra dene ke liye shuru kiya
 It was theorized that some Indians were naturally warlike between castes and communities, and more suited to war than others

 The final blow to the Mahar soldiers came in 1892 when it was decided to institute "class regiments" in the Indian Army
 maharon in varg regimenton main shaamil nahin the, or yah adhishuchet kiya gaya tha ki maharon, kuch anya virgon ke saath ke bich, ab bhartiya sena main bhartee ho gaye the
 The Mahar soldiers, who included 104 Viceroy commissioned officers and a host of non-commissioned officers and soldiers, were demobilized
 is ghatana ko ek sarkari ve ek sau se adhik varshon ke liye kaam kiya tha dwaara apni vafadari kii ek vishwasghaat ke rup main maharon ne mana gaya tha
 After the demobilization of the Mahar troops, there were many attempts by the leaders of the Mahar community to persuade the Government to let them serve in the Army once again
 Petitions to this effect were drafted by ex-soldiers such as Gopal Baba Walangkar in 1894, and Shivram Janba Kamble in 1904
 These petitions were supported in principle by the politician and social reformer Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who was opposed to the Martial Races theory
 They were also supported by the Indian National Congress, who were also opposed to the recruiting policies of the Army
 The recruitment policies of the British Indian Army continued until the beginning of the First World War in 1914
 The War forced the Government to begin more broad-based recruiting, and the Mahars were at last allowed to enlist in the Army
 One battalion of Mahar troops, the 111th Mahars was raised in the June 1917
 However, the battalion did not see much service during the War, and in 1920 it was merged with the 71st Punjabis
 Finally, the battalion was disbanded in March 1921, and the Mahars were once again demobilised
 The period between the wars saw increased efforts by the Mahars to persuade the government to let them enlist in the Army
 One proponent of Mahar recruitment was Dr
 BR Ambedkar, whose father, Sub
 Maj
 Ramji Maloji Sakpal had been a soldier in the British Indian Army
 However, the proposed reorganization of the Indian Army that was to occur in the 1930s was postponed because of a lack of funds in the Great Depression
 In 1939, the Second World War broke out, and once again, the Army was forced to overlook its narrow minded recruitment policies in the face of harsh necessity
 In the July 1941, B
 R
 Ambedkar was appointed to the Defence Advisory Committee of the Viceroy's Executive Council
 He used this appointment to exert pressure within the military establishment for a Mahar regiment
 He also appealed to the Mahars to join the Army in large numbers
 In October, the Army gave in, and the 1st Battalion of the Mahar Regiment was raised in Belgaum under Lt
 Col
 HJR Jackson of the 13th Frontier Force Rifles and Sub
 Maj
 Sheikh Hassnuddin
 The 2nd Battalion was raised in Kamptee in June 1942 under Lt
 Col
 JWK Kirwan and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 a cap badge was designed for the Regiment by Capt
 EEL Mortlemans, an officer of 2nd Mahar
 The badge featured the Koregaon Pillar over the word "MAHAR"
 The third battalion, the 25th Mahars, was raised in Belgaum in the August 1942 by Lt
 Col V
 Chambier and Sub
 Maj
 Sardar Bahadur Ladkojirao Bhonsale, and the 3rd Mahars were raised in Nowshera by Lt
 Col
 RND Frier and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 During the War, the 1st and 3rd Mahars served in the north-west Frontier Province, while the 2nd and 25th Battalions were employed on internal security duties within the country
 The 2nd Battalion also saw service in the Burma Campaign as a part of the 23rd Indian Division, where they suffered 5 casualties and had one officer Mentioned in dispatches
 They also served in Iraq after the War as a part of PAIFORCE
 In 1946, the 25th Mahars were disbanded, along with many other garrison battalions of the Indian Army
 Its officers and men were largely absorbed by the other three battalions of the Regiment
 In the October 1946, the Regiment was converted into a Machine Gun Regiment, and the Regimental Centre was established at Kamptee
 Following conversion of the Regiment to a machine-gun regiment, the cap-badge was changed
 The new badge had two crossed Vickers machine guns over the Koregaon Pillar, over a scroll that said "the Mahar MG Regiment"
 The three surviving battalions of the regiment served as a part of the Punjab Boundary Force, and took part in escorting refugees during the Partition of India
 The Border Scouts were an irregular force formed by the people of the border villages in East Punjab during Partition
 Hailing as they did from the erstwhile greater state of East Punjab, the force had people hailing from a greater mix of ethnic, religious and caste backgrounds than was the norm in the Indian Army
 They did some useful work defending villages from attacks during partition, and as a reward, were given a more permanent character as the East Punjab Frontier Scouts in 1948
 They served along the border with Pakistan as border guards, and were regarded as a useful adjunct of the Punjab Armed Police
 The unit was redesignated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Border Scouts in 1951, with recruitment from different North Indian communities
 In 1956, the decision to convert this force into machine-gun regiments was taken, and the three battalions were merged with the Mahar Regiment, the only Indian Machine Gun Regiment in existence at the time
 They joined the Regiment as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions of the Mahar Regiment, and it is to these units that the Regiment traces its mixed-class composition
 The three Battalions style themselves battalions of the Mahar Regiment even today
 The class composition of the Regiment also changed
 While 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 13th battalions were all pure Mahar battalions, the others were mixed classes right down to the smallest sub-unit level
 The conversion training started in November 1963 with 1st Mahar and completed in May 1964 with 10th Mahar
 The year 1965 saw all the battalions of the regiment gearing up for operations
 These included the newly raised 11th and 12th battalions that had the unique composition of Bengalis, Oriyas and Gujratis - the communities that had been stamped as non-martial by the British
 Their entry into the Mahar fraternity added strength to national integration-the distinctive feature which the regiment has always been proud of

 unhone in pahaluon ko vyapaar chakron ke vishleshan main istemaal karte hue dikhaaya ki saamaajik kaarak kis tarah bachat, shram or upbhog ko prabhavit karte hai jisase ant main puri arthvyavastha par asar padataa he
 He developed the sociological theory of economic inertia and growth
 unka kahana tha ki aarthik vruddhi tab tak uplabdh nahin kii ja sakati jab tak kathor parishram karte hue uske aarthik fal bhogane kii ichha ko kuch samay ke liye sthagit na kar diya jaae
 For this, he recommended hard work as well as development of economical and professionalism
 unhone dekha ki aarthik vruddhi hone par ye pravritiyaan naram pad jaati hai or samaaj main adhik sukhdharmita paidaa hoti he
 The betting starts and the race to make money quickly starts
 lekin ek mukaam par upabhokta rin main betahasha badhotaree hone ke kaaran upabhoktaaon kaa vishwaas dagamagane lagata he
 As a result, expenditure is cut and economic growth slows down
 lekin, isi prakriya main bhavishya kii aarthik vruddhi kii buniyaad rakhi jaati he or ek baar phir aage kiye jane vaale nivesh ke liye bachat karne ke rujhaan paidaa hote hai
 Vilfredo Pareto was the child of an Italian father who had to live in exile in Paris due to opposition to the policies of the Italian government
 unke madhyavargeey parivaar ne unki praathmik shiksha kaa acha prabandh kiya or unhen kathor adhyavsaay va sadgipurn jivan jeene ke sanskaar diye
 Returning to Italy in 1858, he obtained an engineering degree
 ejeeniyar kii naukari karne ke dauraan parato ne england or scotland kii kai yatraayen kin or is dauraan unhen british arthvyavastha kaa avlokan karne kaa mauka mila
 He saw how much Britain was benefiting from the free market policy
 ve adam smith socity ke sakriy sadsy ban gayi or loktantr va mukt vyapaar ke samarthan main lekhan karne lage
 Pareto used to sleep less at night
 is samay kaa sadupyog unhone raajnneetik arthshaastra or samajashaastra ke adhyayan main kiya
 After retiring, he took advantage of his engineering training and began to express economic analysis in mathematical forms
 jaldi hi unki khyaati bad gayi or unhen luzaane vishvavidhyalay main leone walrus kii jagah niyukti mil gayi
 Later, Pareto was weakened by the narrowness of mathematical methods and tried to examine economic activities in the mirror of historical and cultural contexts
 apane chachaa se viraasat main praapt sampatti se unhone ek vishaal bangala karidaa jisamen kisi sanyasi kii tarah akele apni paaltu billiyon ke saath rahete hue unhone apana jivan arthshaastra kii samasyaon par gaur karte hue guzaaraa
 Apart from giving mathematical basis to economics, Pareto is also known for his three other contributions
 unhone aamadani vitaran ke niyam kaa vikaas kiya jo aaj bhi unke naam se hi janaa jaataa he
 He diverted the attention of economists from cardinal utility to ordinal utility
 unhone ek aisi pariksha vidhi bhi viksit kii jiske zariye pataa lagaaya ja saktaa tha ki aarthik parinaam sudhaare ja sakate yaa nahin
 It is also known as the theory of optimal conditions propounded by Pareto
 parato ne vibhinn rashtron main aamadani kii vishmataaon kaa adhyayan kiya or dekha ki yah aay-vitaran ek sahaj pattern ke mutabik hota he
 He ranked the families according to their income and then recorded their income and analyzed it
 nateeja yah niklaa ki aay anupaat main yaa ankaganitiya rup se nahin bad rahi he
 From the poorest of the poorest to the richest family, income was seen to increase geometrically
 agar aay ankaganitiya kram se badhati to tisven number kaa parivaar biswein number ke parivaar se bees fisadi zyaada kamata or yahi kram sauven or nabbewein parivaar ke bich praapt hota
 But the geometric rate of income was showing that the family in the thirty-fifth place was earning ten percent more than the family in the twentieth place, while the family in the fifty-fifth place was fifty percent more than the family in the forty-ninth place and the family in the hundredth hundred percent of the family in the ninth place
 Was earning more parato ne america or kai european deshon main aay vitaran par nigaah daali or paaya ki vishmata kii sthiti ek pattern ke rup main takreeban aisi hi he
 So they called it rule
 parato kaa khyaal tha ki vishmata isi tarah jari rahegi kyonki maldaar log apane raajnneetik rutabe kaa faaydaa uthaa kar vitaran ke is pattern ko badalane hi nahin denge
 This rule of Pareto created much controversy, as many socio-political issues were associated with it, which economists generally shied away from considering
 lekin, parato kii is khoj ko aarthik vigyaan main hone vaali ek mahatvapurn pragati kaa darja bhi mila
 Prior to Pareto, no economist had analyzed the statistics of the incomes of many countries of the world
 ordenal upyogita ko cardinal upyogita par praathamikta de kar parato ne arthshaastriyon se aagrah kiya ki ve upabhokta se bahut zyaada apekshaayen na karen
 According to the cardinal utility, the consumer was expected not only to know how to prioritize one item over the other, but also to know what the quantity of that priority would be
 jabaki ordenal upyogita ke usul ke mutabik upabhokta se keval praathamikta dene kii aashaa hi kii jaani chahie thi
 In practice, the difference between cardinal and ordinal utility can be understood as follows: If a consumer prioritizes mango over pineapple, it would be wrong to expect him to know that he considers mango to be 200% more useful than pineapple or One hundred fifty percent
 upabhokta kaa kareed-vyavhaar aisi koi soochna nahin detaa
 The result of Pareto's request was that it was no longer necessary to measure the usefulness of various people
 jeremi bentham or james stuart mil dwaara viksit upyogetavaad kaa darshan main is uljhan se grast tha
 The result of Pareto's formulation was that efforts to create a scale of utility measurement were stopped
 isi tarah antarvaiyaktik sambandhon main bhi upyogita kii tulanaayen karne kaa ravaiya chhod diya gaya
 It is understood that if two people are exchanging two things, then what they get is more useful than what they are giving
 agar aisa na hota to ve yah vinimay karte hi kyon
 Pareto's third contribution came as a theory of optimal conditions
 aarthik maamalon kii anukultam sthiti kii khoj karte samay parato is nattejey par pahunche ki kuch aarthik parinaam kisi bhi tareeke se behatar nahin kiye ja sakate
 If the condition of one person is to be improved, then the condition of another person will have to be reduced
 yani kul mila kar sthiti main koi sudhaar nahin hoga
 Pareto said that two people do any transaction only when both are expected to benefit
 agar laabh kisi ek ko hi hoga to vinimay hoga hi nahin
 In spite of such a situation, if there is pressure to try to redistribute goods, then there will be no improvement in the situation or economic performance
 isliye bazaar main mukt vinimay kii sthiti hi anukultam kahi ja sakati he
 The results of Pareto's theory were inevitable in the policy field
 kalyankari arthshaastra kii pairokari ke liye bhi iskaa istemaal kiya gaya
 According to this, if every person can do better without doing any harm, then economic welfare can be improved
 yah anukultam paristhiti paidaa ho sake isliye laazmi samajha gaya ki upabhoktaaon ke str par jis seemaant dar se upbhog main pratisthaapan ho, usee seemaant dar se utpaadak apane utpaadan main tabdili karen
 According to Pareto only when this happens, the marginal cost of all production processes can be equal to the marginal income
 duusari taraf, tees ke dashak main arthshaastriyon kaa yah khyaal bhi tha ki moolyagat vivek kaa istemaal kiye bina anukoolt ye paristhiti ke is siddhant ke zariye aarthik pradarshan kaa moolyankan kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, he spent a lot of mind on this question and tried to find out if this principle fails to be effective under certain circumstances
 parato ke is usul ko amiron ko tex riyaayaten dene ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he : agar maldaar logon ko ye riyaayaten milengi to ve nivesh zyaada kar sakenge or aarthik oochaal aayega or nattejey ke taur par garibon kii bhi behatari hogi
 In this case it will be labeled as pareto-superior
 agar tex riyaayaton se aarthik oochaal nahin aayaa to rajasav kii bharpai kisi na kisi kii jeb se to kerani hi hogi
 The Maldars will benefit and the common man's pocket will be empty
 yah parato-optimal mana jayega
 Criticizing Pareto Optimal, Amartya Sen has claimed that the results derived from this theory cannot be called value-neutral or scientific
 yah siddhant is purvadharna par aadhaarit he ki agar koi parivartan vyakti ko kushhaal banaata he to isse kul mila kar vah samaaj bhi kushhaal hota he
 This belief cannot be considered correct
 duusare, yah siddhant sabhi paristhitiyon main shreyaskar nahin he
 For example, the situation of famine is by law Pareto Optimal and the redistribution made to save the public from starvation will go against Pareto Optimal

· Meerut District · Mura Abad district · Rampur district · Raebareli district · Lucknow district charvak darshan ek bhautikwaadi naastik darshan he
 It accepts only direct evidence and does not accept this doctrine from the hereafter
 yah darshan vedabaahya bhi kaha jaataa he
 The Vedabya philosophies are six - Charvaka, Madhyamika, Yogachara, Sautrantika, Vaibhashika, and Arhat
 in sabhi main veda se asammat siddhanton kaa pratipaadan he
 Ajit Keshakambali is credited as the precursor of Charvaka, while Jupiter is commonly referred to as the founder of Charvaka or Lokayat philosophy
 charvak, brihaspati sutara ke adhikansh praathmik sahitya gaayab yaa kho gaye hai
 Its teachings have been compiled from historical secondary literature such as the scriptures, sutras, and in Indian epic poetry and from the dialogues and Jain literature of Gautama Buddha
 charvak pracheen bharat ke ek anishvaravaadi or naastik taarkik the
 They are believed to be the disciples of Jupiter, the originator of the atheist
 brihaspati or charvak kab hue iskaa kuch bhi pataa nahin he
 Jupiter is considered by Chanakya in his Arthashastra book to be one of the principal teachers of economics
 charvak kaa naam sunate hi aapako ‘yada jivet sukhan jivet, rin kruthva, ghrutan pivet’ kii yaad aegi
 ‘charvak’ naam ko hi ghrinaaspad gaali kii tarah badal diya gaya he
 It was as if the borrowers, the philanthropists and the fallen people were the only ones who followed this theory
 prachlit dharna yahi he ki charvak shabd kii utpati ‘chaaru’+’vaak’ se hui he
 It is evident that this nomenclature has been made by those opponents of this theory who believed that these people seduced innocent people with sweet things
 charvak siddhanton ke liye buddha pitakon tak main ‘lokayat’ shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jiskaa matlab ‘darshan kii vah pranali he jo jo is lok main vishwaas karti he or swarg, narak athwa mukti kii avadharana main vishwaas nahin rakhti’
 charvak yaa lokayat darshan kaa zikr to mahabharat main bhi miltaa he lekin iskaa koi bhi mul granth uplabdh nahin
 Apparently, as it spoke against the ruling forces of its time, its texts were destroyed and in the popular narrative, the Charvakas were introduced as villains
 sarvadarshansangrah main charvak kaa mat diya hua miltaa he
 It is written in Padmapurana that Jupiter had expressed Vedaviruddha opinion to seduce Asuras
 naastik mat ke sambadh main vishnupurana main likhaa he ki jab dharmabal se daitya bahut prabal hue tab devataaon ne vishnu ke yahan pukaar kii
 Vishnu produced a man named Mayamoh from his body who went on the banks of the Narmada in the form of Digambar and seduced the Asuras and corrupted them in the Dharmargava
 mayamoh ne asuron ko jo upadesh kiya vah sarvadarshansangrah main die hue charvak mat ke shlokon se bilkul miltaa he
 Like, - Mayamoh has said that if the animal killed in the yagna goes to heaven then why does not Yajaman kill his father, etc
 lingapurana main tripuravinaash ke prasang main bhi shivaprerit ek digambar muni dwaara asuron ke isi prakaar bahakaae jane kii katha likhi he jiskaa lakshya jainon par jaan padataa he
 In the Valmiki Ramayana Ayodhya scandal, Maharishi Javali's preaching to Ramachandra to leave Banabas and return to Ayodhya is also found in the opinion of Charvak
 in sab baton se siddh hota he ki naastik mat bahut pracheen he
 It should be understood at the same time that the excess of Vedic rituals had started knocking some people
 charvak ishwar or paralok nahin maanate
 His philosophy is also called Lokayat because of not obeying the hereafter
 sarvadarshansangrah main charvak ke mat se sukh hi is jivan kaa pradhan lakshya he
 There is also sorrow in the world, realizing that those who do not want to enjoy happiness are fools
 machhlee main kaante hote hai to kya isse koi machhlee hi na khaay ? choupaae khet par jaayange, is dar se kya koi khet hi na bove ? ityadi
 Charvaks do not consider the soul as a separate substance
 unke mat se jis prakaar gud, tandul aadi ke sanyog se madh main maadakta utpann ho jaati he usee prakaar prithvi, jal, tej or vaayu in chaar bhuton ke sanyogvishesh se chetanta utpann ho jaati he
 By their analysis or destruction, 'I' means consciousness is also destroyed
 is chetan sharir ke naam ke peeche phir punaragaman aadi nahin hota
 God, otherworldly subjects etc
 are based on conjecture
 par charvak pratyaksh ko chhodkar anumaan ko pramaan main nahin lete
 He argues that inference is dependent on prevalence
 jo gyaan hamen baahar indriyon ke dwaara hota he use bhoot or bhavishya tak badhaakar le jane kaa naam vyaptigyaan he, jo asambhav he
 This knowledge is visible in the mind, it is not a proof because the mind is dependent on the senses for its experience
 yadi kaho ki anumaan ke dwaara vyaptigyaan hota he to itaretarashray dosha aata he, kyonki vyaptigyaan ko lekar hi to anumaan ko siddh kiya chaahate ho
 The idea of charvak should be seen in Sarvadarsanasangraha, sarvadarshanasiromani and jupitersutra
 naishadh ke 17wein sarg main bhi is mat kaa vistrut ullekh he
 Charvak only supports pragmatism, he does not follow the presumptions etc
 uske mat se prithvi jal tej or vaayu ye chaar hi tatv he, jinase sab kuch bana he
 In his opinion, the sky is not the position of the element, it is a body formed by the combination of these four elements, only a special type of combination of them creates consciousness in the body, which people call a soul
 sharir jab vinasht ho jaataa he, to chaitanya bhi khatm ho jaataa he
 In this way, the organism originates from these ghosts and ends as soon as these ghosts are destroyed, it has no importance back and forth
 isaliye jo chetan main deh dikhaai detii he vahi aatma kaa rup he, deh se atirikt aatma hone kaa koi pramaan hi nahin miltaa he
 By the opinion of Charvak, women are called sons and their relatives and the happiness given by them is called happiness
 unka aalingan karnaa hi purusharth he, sansar main khaanaa pinaa or sukh se rahanaa chaiye
 It has been said in this philosophy that: - arth he ki jab tak jeena chaiye sukh se jeena chaiye, agar apane paas saadhan nahin he, to duusare se udhaar lekar mouj karnaa chaiye, shamshaan main sharir ke jalane ke baad sharir ko kisne waapas aate dekha he? According to Charvaka philosophy, these four elements earth, water, light and air are the root causes of creation
 jis prakaar buddha usee prakaar charvak kaa bhi mat he ki akaash naamak koi tatva nahin he
 This is just zero
 apni aanvik avasthaa se sthool avasthaa main aane par uparyukt chaar tatva hi bahya jagat, indriya athwa deh ke rup main drusht hote hai
 Their proof system is the reason behind not obeying the objective power of the sky
 jis prakaar ham gandh, ras, rup or sparsh kaa pratyaksh anubhav karte hue unke samavayiyon kaa bhi tattat indriyon ke dwaara pratyaksh karte hai
 The sky element is not the same
 at: unke mat main akaash naamak tatva he hi nahin
 What is the reason for the four elements? Charvakas do not have the answer to this question
 yah vishwa akasmaat bhinn-bhinn roopon evam bhinn-bhinn matraaon main milane vaale chaar mahabhuton kaa sangrah yaa sanghatt maatr he
 According to the Charvakas, there is no other substance called the Atma from the four mahabhutas
 chaitanya aatma kaa gun he
 Since there is no such thing as a soul, therefore the virtue or religion of the conscious body is proved
 arthath yah sharir hi aatma he
 There are three types of its accomplishment - logic, experience and Ayurveda scripture
 tark se aatma kii siddhi ke liye charvak log kehete hai ki sharir ke rahane par chaitanya rahata he or sharir ke na rahane par chaitanya nahin rahata
 With this unknown contrast, the body itself proves to be the basis of consciousness
 anubhav 'main sthool hoon', 'main durbal hoon', 'main gora hoon', 'main niskriy hoon' ityadi anubhav hamen pag-pag par hota he
 Physical weakness etc
 are the religions of the body and 'I' is also the same
 at: sharir hi aatma he
 In Ayurveda, mixing of good, barley, mahua, etc
 in order of chronological order makes the mixture strong, or a mixture of curd, yellow clay and cow dung produces a scorpion or in betel leaf, catechu, betel nut and lime
 Redness in the mouth is produced by mixing them even if there is no red color, in the same way Chaitanya is produced by the specific combination of quadrilaterals
 kintu in bhuton ke vishisht maatra main mishran kaa kaaran kya he? is prashn kaa uttar charvak ke paas swabhaavvaad ke atirikt kuch nahin he
 In the scriptures of God, justice etc
, God is proved by the presumption or objection
 chunki charvak pratyaksh or keval pratyaksh pramaan ko maanata he at: uske mat main pratyaksh drishyman raja hi ishwar hai vah apane rajya kaa tathaa usamen rahane vaali praja kaa niyanta hota he
 Therefore, he should be considered as God
 prameya arthath vishay kaa yatharth gyaan arthath prama ke liye pramaan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Charvac folk consider only direct evidence
 vishay tathaa indriya ke sannikarsh se utpann gyaan pratyaksh gyaan kehalaata he
 The world theorem is directly visible through our senses
 iske atirikt anya padaarth asat he
 Through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin, the word Gandh Rasa and touch are directly visible to all of us
 jo vastu anubhavgamya nahin hoti uske liye kisi anya pramaan kii aavashyaktaa bhi nahin hoti
 Buddhists, Jainism, non-vedic philosophy and nyaya-vedic, etc
 also consider semi-vedic philosophy inference as proof
 unka kahana he ki samast prameya padaarthon kii satta keval pratyaksh pramaan se siddh nahin kii ja sakati
 But Charvak states that only possibility can be created by inference
 nishchayatmak gyaan pratyaksh se hi hota hai
 Seeing the remote green lush trees, listening to the cacophony of the birds there, we consider the possibility of water there due to the cool breeze from there
 jal kii uplabdhi vahaan jaakar pratyaksh dekhne se hi nishchit hoti he
 Therefore, to generate possibility and to conduct public behavior, inference is necessary but it cannot be proof
 jis vyapti ke aadhaar par anumaan pramaan kii satta maani jaati he vah vyapti ke atirikt kuch nahin he
 It is the nature of fire with dhoom and the smell of smell with flowers
 sukh or dharm kaa du:kha or adharm kaa kaaryakaaran bhav swaabhaavik he
 Just like the sweetness in the word of Kokil and the consternation in the word of crows, it should be understood everywhere
 jahaan tak shabd pramaan kii baat he to vah to ek prakaar se pratyaksh pramaan hi he
 The words of the aggrieved person are directly told to us
 unako sunne se arth gyaan hota he
 This is obvious
 jahaan tak vedon kaa prashn he unke vaakya adrusht or ashrutapurna vishyon kaa varnan karte hai at: unki vishwasaneeyata sandigdh he
 At the same time, Vedas prove their inhumanity by doing disgusting things like Ashwaglagrahna in unrighteousness etc
 and committing abusive acts like eating meat and using meaningless words like Jarbhari Turfari
 uparyukt vivaran se yah spasht ho jaataa he ki charvak log is pratyaksh drishyman deh or jagat ke atirikt kisi anya padaarth ko sweekaar nahin karte
 Those people who consider Purusharthchatashta, called religion, meaning, work and salvation, are considered useful for men, ie human body
 unki drushti main arth or kaam hi param purusharth he
 It is foolish to believe in an object called religion because when there is no other heaven etc
 apart from this world, it is unrestrained to enjoy the fruit of religion in heaven
 pakhand dhurtton ke dwaara kapolkalpit swarg kaa sukh bhogane ke liye yahan yajna aadi karnaa dharm nahin he balki usamen kii jane vaali pashu hinsa aadi ke kaaran vah adharm hi he tathaa havan aadi karnaa tattd vastuon kaa durupyog tathaa vyarth sharir ko ksht dena he isaliye jo kaary sharir ko sukh pahunchaaye usee ko karnaa chaiye
 In which there is satisfaction of the senses, the mind should rejoice
 jinase indriyon kii tripti ho man anandit ho unheen vishyon kaa seven karnaa chaiye
 Religion is not to remove, not kill, kill those elements which are obstructing the senses of the body
 shaareerik maansik ksht sahanaa, vishayanand se man or sharir ko balaat virat karnaa adharm he
 This means that the believer in Vedic and even semi-vedic philosophies, following the ethos described in the Puranas, if the body is a seeker of happiness, they should follow it and if they are obstructed by it, they should be discarded forever
 charvaakon kii moksh kii kalpana bhi unke tatva mimasaa evam gyaan mimasaa ke prabhaav se purna prabhavit he
 As long as there is a body, a man suffers from various kinds of suffering
 yahi narak he
 Freedom from this suffering group is attained when the body becomes conscious, that is, it dies
 yah maranaa hi moksh he kyonki mrit sharir ko kisi bhi ksht kaa anubhav mar jaataa he
 It is salvation to die because the dead body does not experience any suffering
 yadhyapi anya darshanon main aatma ke astitv ko sweekaar karte hue usee ke mukt hone kii charchaa kii gayi he or moksh kaa swaroop bhinn-bhinn darshanon main bhinn-bhinn he, tathaapi charvak unki manyata ko prashray nahin dete
 He neither considers salvation as eternal, neither considers it to be true and chit form, nor does he accept salvation as his position in Sachchidanand form
 charvak darshan vah darshan he jo jan saamaanya main swabhaavat: priy he
 The philosophy whose sentences are charu means interesting is the Charvak philosophy
 sabhi shastreey gambheer vishyon kaa vyaavhaarik evam loukik purv paksh hi charvak darshan he
 Everything we do in the natural form is the basis of the Charvak philosophy
 charvak darshan jivan ke har paksh ko sahaj drushti se dekhtaa he
 This simple vision towards life is Charvak philosophy
 vaastaviktaa to yah he ki, vishwa kaa har maanav jo jivan jeeta he vah charvak darshan hi he
 Such sentences and principles which will be pleasing to everyone, will be a rectangle or special in the world
 sambhavat: yahi kaaran he ki ham charvak darshan ko lokayat darshan ke naam se bhi jaanate hai
 This philosophy is also famous among scholars known as Barhaspatya philosophy
 is naam se yah prathit hota he ki yah darshan brihaspati ke dwaara virachit he
 Brihaspati is recognized as the guru of the gods in Indian society
 parantu bhartiya sahitya main brihaspati ek nahin hai
 It is a very difficult task to decide who is the originator of Charvak philosophy, Jupiter
 anigaras evam loukya rup main do brihaspatiyon kaa samullekh rugveda main praapt hota he
 According to Ashwaghosha, Arghus is the prophet of Jupiter's philosophy
 loukya brihaspati ke mat main sat padaarth kii utpatti asat se maani jaati he
 Similarly, the origin of discrete matter has been assumed from the truth
 jad padaarthon ko hi asat kaha jaataa he
 Conscious substances are called Satas according to this belief
 ek brihaspati kaa nirdesh mahabharat ke van parv main bhi praapt hota he
 This Jupiter takes the form of Venus, to conserve Indra and to destroy the demons, to create anatomism or prapancha science
 is prapanch vigyaan ke falswaroop shubh ko ashubh evam ashubh ko shubh maanate hue daanav veda evam shastron kii aalochana evam ninda main sanlagn ho jate hai
 In another context, there is a description of another Jupiter in the Mahabharata itself, who, together with Shukracharya, composed the discourse
 vibhinn shastron ke aacharyon kii maane to charvak mat darshan kii shrenee main nahin mana ja saktaa kyonki is darshan main maatr madhur vachanon kii aad main vanchanaa kaa hi kaary kiya gaya he
 It is another matter that if he listens to Charvak, he also declares various scholars to be deceptive
 ek aise brihaspati kaa taittareey brahman granth main varnan miltaa he jo gayatri devi ke mastak par aghat karata he gayatri devi ko padam puraana ke anusaar samast vedon kaa mul mana gaya he
 From this point of view it can be considered as the antagonist of Jupiter Veda
 sambhavat: veda kaa virodh prati pad karne ke kaaran is brihaspati ko charvak darshan kaa praneta bhi mana janaa yuktiyukt hoga
 The theme of Jupiter is also found in Vishnu Purana
 brihaspati kii is manyata ke anusaar vaidic karmkand bahuvitt ke vyay evam prayaas se saadhy he
 These Vedic remedies for the seekers of diverse pleasures are the law of some self-centered selfishness
 taarkik brihaspati kaa bhi kahin kahin varnan miltaa he
 They are the followers of the Jupiter Veda, but only support rational rituals
 inaki drushti se tatva nirnay shaastra par aadhaarit avashya hona chahie parantu yah shastreey anusandhan tark poshit hona nitant aavashyak he
 Argumentless thinking can never be meaningful in determining religion
 vatsyayan muni ne apane vishwa prasiddh granth kamasutra main arthshaastra ke rachayita ke rup main brihaspati kaa ullekh kiya he
 According to a formula of economics written by Jupiter, only Lokayata has been recognized as a scripture
 falat: arthshaastra ke praneta brihaspati evam lokayat shaastra ke pravarttak main antar kar paanaa atyant duruh kaary he
 Some critics have considered Jupiter to be the creator of Kamasutra as well as the creator of economics and the creator of Lokayata Shastra
 yadi loukik ichchhaaon ko purna karnaa hi charvak darshan kaa uddeshy he to kaamshaastra ke pravarttak muni vatsyayan hi brihaspati hai, yah maananaa upyukt hi he
 Kautilya has given a comfortable rendering of Lokayat philosophy in economics
 is prakaar arthshaastra ke rachanaakaar kautilya evam lokayat darshan ke praneta brihaspati ek hi hai aisa mana ja saktaa he
 According to the treasurer Hemachandra, the author of Economics, Kamasutra, nyasutra-bhasya, Panchatantra and Chanakya Policy is the same
 itani vivechna ke baad jo brihaspati vaidic vaaiumay main vibhinn prasangon main charchit hai unke yatha kram naam is prakaar spasht hote hai
 In the context of Padma Purana, Angira is the psyche son of Brahma
 angiras brihaspati angira ke putr evam brahma ke pautra hai
 As a result, they are counted among the gods
 is prakaar dev guru brihaspati evam angiras brihaspati main koi bhed nahin mana ja saktaa
 For the preservation of the gods, the preaching of the devas to the asuras by the Guru of the gods has been implied in various worlds, this statement cannot be reliable in the context of Dev Guru Brihaspati
 asur apane guru shukracharya ke rahete devguru ke upadesh ko kyon aadar denge? at: devguru se atirikt koi charvak darshan kaa pravarttak hona apekshit he
 Some critics have categorically acknowledged that Jupiter, the master of Charvaka, the master of heaven Indra, the master of heaven, is not a world-renowned Jupiter
 ye brihaspati kisi rajkul ke guru hai
 From the historical point of view, if Vashistha, Vishwamitra, Dronacharya, etc
, being the master of any Rajkula, is also giving the basis for this belief
 jis prakaar aastik darshanon main shankar darshan shiromani ke rup main sweekrut he usee prakaar naastik darshanon main sabase utkrisht naastik ke rup main shiromani kii tarah charvak darshan kii pratishtha nirvivaad he
 Atheist Shiromani Charwak is also believed to have rejected the supernatural sovereign power of God recognized in one form or another on the basis of faith in the world
 inke matanusaar ishwar naam kii koi vastu sansar main nahin he
 The atheist Shiromani Charwak, who is visible from some external senses, feels the same, accepts his power
 yahi kaaran he ki charvak ke siddhanth main pratyaksh pramaan ko chhod kar koi doosraa pramaan nahin mana gaya he
 The power of the God who has been conceived in other philosophies is not possible through direct evidence
 inke mat se beej se jo ankur kaa pradurbhaav hota he usamen ishwar kii bhoomika ko maananaa anaavashyak evam uphasaaspad hi he
 The origin of sprout is proven to be a natural and natural process of survival by the combination of soil and water
 is swabhaavik kaary ko sampann karne ke liye kisi adrusht kartta kii sweekruti nirarthak he
 If you do not believe in God, how will it be possible to arrange the results of good and inauspicious deeds of living beings? Solving this question, Charvak asks, which system of karma fruit is required? Two types of karma are seen in the world
 ek loukik tathaa doosraa alokik karm
 Are you concerned about the arrangement of the fruits of cosmic actions? If yes, then this concern is unnecessary
 loukik karmon kaa fal vidhaan to lok main sarv maanya raja yaa prashaasak hi karata he
 This proven fact is obvious
 ham dekhte hai ki chaurya karm aadi nishiddh kaary karne vaale ko uske dushkarm kaa samuchit fal, lok siddh raja hi dand ke rup main karagaar aadi main bhej kar detaa he
 In the same way, a person who performs auspicious actions like protecting one's life, etc
, in the form of a reward, the king confirms it with a good means of wealth and honor
 yadi aap alokik karmon ke fal kii vyavastha ke sandarbh main sachint hai to yah chintaa bhi nahin kerani chahie
 Because all these Yajna, Puja, recitation, penance etc
 prescribed in terms of parlokik fruits have been conceived by some rogues with a view to cheating the common man and to maintain their livelihood and stomach
 vastav main agnihotra, teen veda, tridand kaa dhaaran tathaa sharir main jagah jagah bhasma kaa sanlep buddhi evam purusharth hinata ke hi parichaayak hai
 No one has lost sight of these Vedic deeds till date
 yadi vaidic karmon kaa koi fal hota to avashya kisi na kisi ko iskaa pratyaksh aaj tak hua hota
 Therefore, till date no one has the direct experience of these Vedic or Varnashrama-system-related deeds - heaven, salvation, devaloka gaan etc
, so all these Vedic deeds are unfruitful, it is proved to be automatic
 yahan yadi aastik darshan yah kahe ki paralok swarg aadi ko siddh karne vaala vyapaar adrusht yaa dharm evam adharm he jisase swarg kii siddhi hoti he to yah charvak ko sweekaarya nahin he
 Rejecting the supernatural, the Charvak abrogates the role of the unseen in the means of heaven and heaven and thus destroys the core of the believer's philosophy
 yahi kaaran he ki adrusht ke aadhaar par siddh hone vaale swarg aadi paralok ke nirasan ke saath hi is adrusht ke niamak yaa vyavasthaapak ke rup main ishwar kaa bhi niraas charvak mat main anayas hi ho jaataa he
 In Charvak, no living being is different from the body
 sharir hi jeev yaa aatma he
 As a result, when the destruction of the body takes place after the cremation after death, then the creature or soul also perishes
 sharir main jo chaar yaa paanch mahabhuton kaa samavdhaan he, yah samavdhaan hi chaitanya kaa kaaran he
 This belief that this creature goes beyond death after death, it is proved unfounded by accepting the body as conscious or soul
 shastron main paribhaashit moksh rup param purusharth bhi charvak nahin sweekaar karata he
 Salvation of the conscious body is salvation in this opinion
 dharm evam adharm ke na hone se charvak siddhanth main dharm-adharm yaa punya-paap ko, koi adrishy swarg evam narak aadi fal bhi nahin he yah anayas hi siddh ho jaataa he
 In Charvak, how can the sensation of the sensation of the child in childhood be remembered in old age or youth when the body is considered a soul? This is a burning question that arises easily
 yahan yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki baalyavastha kaa sharir, vriddhavastha kaa sharir evam yuvavastha kaa sharir ek hi he
 If the body of the three states were the same, then there would not be such a big difference between the bodies of these three states
 antar se yah spasht siddh hota he ki sharir ke avyav jo maance pind aadi hai inamen vruddhi evam hraas hota he
 And it is only due to these degradation and growth that destruction of the body of childhood and creation of the body of youth is proved
 yadi yah kahen ki yuvavastha ke sharir main yah vahi sharir he, yah vyavhaar hone ke kaaran sharir ko ek maan kar uparyukt samaran ko utpann kiya ja saktaa he, to yah kathan bhi yuktiyukt nahin ho saktaa
 Because this is the same body, this affirmation is due to the similarity of form and shape
 falat: donon avasthaaon ke shariron ko abhinn nahin mana ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, in order to fulfill the memory of the pre-seen childhood period, the birth rites in the body of the Charvak Balakala create new rites like the ones in the body of other youth
 isi prakaar yuvavastha ke sharir main vidyaman sanskaar vriddhavastha ke sharir main apane jaise sanskaar utpann kar dete hai
 The etavata is recollected in the Charvak School without any hindrance from the address of these childhood rites
 antat: charvak darshan main sharir hi aatma he yah sahaj hi siddh hota he
 If the body itself is a soul, then Charvak can be asked that 'mama body' this is my body, how will such a popular behavior be generated? By this behavior it seems that the body is different and the master of the body is someone else, who is a separate soul from the body
 is prashn kaa samaadhaan karte hue charvak kahata he ki jaise daanav vishesh ke sir ko hi raahu kaha gaya he, phir bhi jan-saamaanya 'raahu kaa sir' yah vyavhaar bade hi sahaj rup main karata he, usee prakaar sharir ke hi aatma hone par bhi 'meraa sharir' yah loksiddh vyavhaar uppann ho jaayegaa
 In the Charvakas, the objection of remembrance cannot be dispelled if the senses are destroyed by considering some of the Charvak senses as a soul
 kinhin charvaakon ne praan evam man ko bhi aatma ke rup main mana he
 To prove that the body is a soul, Charvak also presents the context of this Veda for the satisfaction of the believers
 is veda vachan kaa taatpary he ki 'vigyaan se yukt aatma in bhuton se utpann ho kar ant main in bhuton main hi villin ho jaataa he
 It is the merger of the soul with the body in the ghosts and death
 ' This giant Buddha statue is one of the Buddhist pilgrimage and tourist routes in Bodh Gaya, Bihar

 In India, 'darshan' is called the technique by which the element can be interviewed
 'tatv darshan' yaa 'darshan' kaa arth he tatv kaa saakshaatkaar
 Philosophy has been born in India only to eradicate human suffering and / or to conduct elemental interviews

 bhartiya rishion ne jagat ke rahasy ko anek konon se samajhane kii koshish kii he
 About Indian philosophers, TS Eliot had said- bhartiya darshan kis prakaar or kin paristhitiyon main astitv main aayaa, kuch bhi pramanik rup se nahin kaha ja saktaa
 But it is so clear that during the Upanishad period, philosophy started developing as a separate scripture
 tattvon ke anveshan kii pravriti bharatvarsh main us sudur kaal se he, jise ham 'vaidic yug' ke naam se pukaarte hai
 Since the very ancient era of the Rigveda, we have a philosophy of dualistic tendency and dual goals in Indian thought
 pratham pravriti pratibha yaa pragnamulak he tathaa dwitiya pravriti tarkmulak he
 It is only by the power of wisdom that the first tendency works in the deliberation of the elements and the second tendency is able to review the elements with the help of logic
 angreji shabdon main pehali kii ham ‘intutionistic’ kah sakate hai or duusari ko reshanlistic
 There were two types of goals from the beginning itself - the acquisition of wealth and the interview of Brahma
 pragnamulak or tark-mulak pravritiyon ke paraspar sammilan se aatma ke aupnishadishth tatvagyan kaa sfoot aavirbhaav hua
 The knowledge of the Upanishads was emanated in the paradigmatic Vedanta, which proved the unification of the soul and the divine
 bhartiya manishiyon ke urvar mastishk se jis karm, gyaan or bhakthimay tripathga kaa pravaah udbhoot hua, usne dur-dur ke maanvon ke aadhyatmik kalmsh ko dhokar unhenne pavitra, nity-shuddh-buddha or sadaa svachh banaakar maanavtaa ke vikaas main yogadan diya he
 People call this impure stream called Darshan
 anveshakon kaa vichaar he ki is shabd kaa vartmaan arth main sabase pehla prayog vaisheshik darshan main hua
 The word 'darshan', according to Paninian grammar, is derived from affixing lute to 'darshi varshana' dhatu
 atev darshan shabd kaa arth drushti yaa dekhnaa, ‘jiske dwaara dekha jaay’ yaa ‘jisamen dekha jaay’ hoga
 The meaning of the word darshan is not just to see or to see normal
 isiilie panini ne dhatworth main ‘prekshan’ shabd kaa prayog kiya he
 The excellent test, in which observing or contemplating conclusions is taken by philosophy
 is prakaar ke prakrusht ikshan ke saadhan or fal donon kaa naam darshan he
 Where these principles are compiled, those books will also be named Darshan, such as Nyaya Darshan, Vaiseshika Darshan, Mimamsa Darshan, etc
 darshan granthon ko darshanashastra bhi kehete hai
 This scripture is derived from the word 'shasu Anushyau'
 darshanon kaa upadesh vaiyaktik jivan ke sammarjan or parishkaran ke liye hi adhik upyogi he
 Spiritual purity and elevation without darshan is rare
 darshan-shaastra hi hamen pramaan or tark ke sahare andhkaar main dipajyoti pradaan karke hamaara maarg-darshan karne main samarth hota he
 According to the Gita, Karma Kimkarmeti Kavayopatyatra Mohita: The attainment of ultimate goal and effort is possible only through philosophical knowledge, otherwise not
 darshan dwaara vishyon ko ham sankshep main do virgon main rakh sakate hai
 Cosmic and supernatural or physical and spiritual
 darshan yaa to vistrut sristi prapanch ke vishay main siddhanth yaa aatma ke vishay main hamase charchaa karata he
 Thus the subject of philosophy is both inert and conscious
 pracheen rigvaidic kaal se hi darshanon ke mul tattvon ke vishay main kuch na kuch sanket hamaare aarsh sahitya main milte hai
 Below are the first sutras of major philosophies which broadly introduce the subject matter of that philosophy- vedon main jo aadhaar tatva beej rup main bikhare dikhaai padate the, ve brahmanon main aakar kuch ubhare; parantu vahaan karmkand kii lataaon ke pratanon main fasakar bahut adhik nahin bad paye
 These sprouted in the Aranyakas and thrived in the Upanishads
 darshanon kaa vikaas jo hamen upanishdon main hamen drushtigochar hota he, aalochakon ne uskaa shriganesh lagbhag dau sau varsh isa purv sthir kiya he
 It is ancient from Mahatma Buddha
 itnaa hi nahin vidwaanon ne sankhya, yoga or mimasaa ko bhi buddha se pracheen mana he
 It is possible that these philosophies may not have existed at that time, although they were present in some form
 vaisheshikdarshan bhi shaayad buddha se pracheen hi he; kyonki jaisaa aaj ke yug main nyaay or vaisheshik samaan tantra samajhe jate hai, usee prakaar pehle purv mimance or vaisheshik samajhe jate the
 The emergence of Buddhist philosophy is believed to be two hundred years before Christ, but Jain philosophy is also ancient than Buddhist philosophy
 isaki pushti main yah pramaan diya jaataa he ki pracheen jain darshanon main na to buddha darshan or na kisi hindu darshan kaa hi khandan uplabdh hota he
 Mahavir Swami, who is considered the originator of Jainism, was also ancient to Buddha
 atev jain darshan kaa buddha darshan se pracheen hona yuktiyukt anumaan he
 The historical sequence of Indian philosophies is difficult to determine
 in sab bhinn-bhinn darshanon kaa lagbhag saath hi saath samaan rup se pradurbhaav evam vikaas hua he
 Many links have broken up here and there
 at: jo kuch shesh he, usee kaa aadhaar lekar chalanaa he
 In this sequence, even if there is no pure historicity, the series of gradual development has continued from beginning to end
 isliye praayah vidwaanon ne isi kram kaa anusaran kiya he
 Indian philosophy begins with the Vedas
 "veda" bhartiya dharm, darshan, samskruti, sahitya aadi sabhi ke mul strot hai
 Even today Veda-mantras are sung on the occasion of religious and cultural acts
 anek darshan-sampradaay vedon ko apana aadhaar or pramaan maanate hai
 In the modern sense, we cannot call Vedas texts of philosophy
 ve pracheen bharatvasiyon ke sangitamay kavy ke sankalan he
 They include many topics of Indian life of that time
 vedon ke in geeton main anek prakaar ke darshanik vichaar bhi milte hai
 It is from these seeds of contemplation that the Vanarajis of later philosophies have developed
 adhikansh bhartiya darshan vedon ko apana adistrot maanate hai
 These are called "theistic philosophies"
 prasiddh shaddarshan inhen ke antargat hai
 The philosophies which consider themselves independent of the Vedic tradition are also influenced to some extent by the Vedic ideologies
 vedon kaa rachanakaal bahut vivadagrast he
 Western scholars often composed the Rigveda around 1500 BC
 From 2500 BC Till is considered
 iske vipareet bhartiya vidvan jyotish aadi ke pramaanon dwaara rugveda kaa samay 3000 i
pus
 se lekar 75000 varsh i
pus
 tak maanate hai
 It is difficult to estimate the time of these ancient creations based on the known motions of history
 pracheen kaal main itane vishaal or samrudh sahitya ke vikaas main hajaaron varsh lage honge, isamen koi andeh nahin
 The available Vedic literature is a small fraction of the entire Vedic literature
 pracheen yug main rachit samast sahitya sankalit bhi nahin ho sakaa hoga or sankalit sahitya kaa bahut sa bhaag akramanakariyon ne nasht kar diya hoga
 The actual Vedic literature was so vast that it is difficult to imagine its creation
 nihsandeh vah bahut pracheen rahaa hoga
 In connection with the Vedas, it is necessary to clarify that "vedas", like the Quran and the Bible, are not the name of a single book, nor are they creations of any one human being
 "veda" ek sampurna sahitya he jisaki vishaal parampara he or jisamen anek granth sammilit hai
 In the religious tradition, the Vedas are considered to be eternal, unconquerable and divine
 aitihaasik drushtikon se ham unhen rishiyon kii rachana maan sakate hai
 The sages who created the Vedamantras are many
 vaidic sahitya kaa vikaas chaar charnon main hua he
 These Samhita are called Brahmins, Aranyakas and Upanishads
 mantron or stutiyon ke sangrah ko "samhita" kehete hai
 The Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda are the codes of mantras
 inaki bhi anek shakhaayen hai
 The mantras of these Samhita were sung to praise the gods on the occasion of Yajna
 aaj bhi dharmik or saanskrithik krityon ke avasar par inkaa gayan hota he
 The musical hymns of the gods Indra, Agni, Varuna, Surya, Som, Usha etc
 are safe in these Vedamantras
 yajna or devopasana hi vaidic dharm kaa mul rup tha
 The spirit of the Vedas is not sanyasapradhan as in the later philosophies
 vedamantron main jivan ke prati aasthaa tathaa jivan kaa ullas otprot he
 The untruth of the world is not known in the Vedantras
 rugveda main loukik mulyon kaa paryaapt maan he
 Vedic sages pray for food, wealth, children, health, longevity, victory etc
 from the gods
 vedon ke mantra pracheen bharatiyon ke sangitamay lokkavy ke uttam udhaaharan hai
 The prose is predominant in the Brahmin, Aranyaka and Upanishadic texts, though their prose is also rhythmic
 brahman granthon main yagyon kii vidhi, unke prayojan, fal aadi kaa vivechan he
 In the Aranyakantha texts, there is an inclination towards spirituality
 jaisaa ki is naam se hi vidit hota he, ye vanprasthon ke upyog ke granth hai
 The Upanishads are dominated by spiritual thought
 chaaron vedon kii mantrasamhitaon ke brahman, aaranyak or upanishad alag alag milte hai
 Brahmins like Shatapath, Tanday etc
 are famous and important
 aitarey, taittiriya aadi ke naam se aaranyak or upanishad donon milte hai
 Apart from these, ancient Upanishads like Ish, Cane, Kath, Saiv, Mundak, Mandukya etc
 are the archetypes of Indian thought
 upanishdon kaa darshan aadhyatmik he
 The main goal of Upanishads is the cultivation of Brahma
 brahm ko aatma bhi kehete hai
 The "soul" is an indescribable and imperceptible element beyond all the permeable elements of the subject, body, senses, mind, intellect, etc
, which is chitsurapa, infinite and blissful
 sabhi parichchhedon se pare hone ke kaaran vah anant he
 Being uncooperative and one, the soul can form the basis of inner impulse and non-monopoly among humans in the discriminating world
 aatma hi manushya kaa vaastavik swaroop he
 By interviewing him, man becomes free from all the shackles of mind
 advaitabhaav kii purnataa ke liye aatma athwa brahm se jad jagat kii utpatti kaise hoti he, isaki vyakhya ke liye maaya kii anirvachaneey shakti kii kalpana kii gai he
 But spiritual advaitaabha is more important aspect of Vedanta of Upanishads than creationism
 yahi advaitabhaav bhartiya samskruti main otprot he
 This Brahmanism of the Upanishads in the field of philosophy became the basis of the later Vedanta views of Adi Shankara, Ramanujacharya etc
 vedon kaa antim bhaag hone ke kaaran upanishdon ko "vedant" bhi kehete hai
 The opinion of the Upanishads became the basis of Vedanta doctrine and sects later
 upanishdon kii style saral or gambhir he
 Serious elements of experience are expressed in Upanishads in a very simple language
 unako samajhane ke liye anubhav kaa prakaash apekshit he
 Experience of Brahm is the goal of Upanishads
 vah apni sadhana se hi praapt hota he
 Contact with the Guru is more helpful in that
 tap, aachaar aadi sadhana kii bhoomika banaate hai
 Karma is not a seeker of spiritual experience
 karm pradhan vaidic dharm se upanishdon kaa yah matbhed he
 Sannyas, asceticism, yoga, penance, renunciation etc
 have been given great importance in the Upanishads
 inamen shraman parampara ke kathor sanyasawad kii prerana kaa strot dikhaai detaa he
 Tapoist Jainism and Buddhism and Gita's Karmayoga have sprouted in the spiritual land of the Upanishads
 hindu dharm main darshan atyant pracheen parampara rahi he
 In Vedic philosophies, conspiracy is more famous and ancient
 gita kaa karmwaad bhi inke samakaleen he
 The conspiracies are called 'theistic philosophy'
 ve veda kii satta ko maanate hai
 Apart from various types of theistic philosophies in the Hindu philosophical tradition, atheistic and materialistic philosophical traditions have also existed
 maharishi gautam rachit is darshan main padaarthon ke tatvagyan se moksh prapti kaa varnan he
 The philosophy of substances leads to the elimination of false knowledge
 phir ashubh karmo main pravrutt na hona, moh se mukti evam dukhon se nivritti hoti he
 In this, God has been considered as the creator, formless, omnipresent and individual soul apart from the body and nature is unconscious and the cause of creation of the universe and it clearly depicts trivialism
 iske alaava isamen nyaay kii paribhaasha ke anusaar nyaay karne kii paddati tathaa usamen jai-paraajay ke kaarnon kaa spasht nirdesh diya gaya he
 This philosophy composed by Maharishi Kanad describes the true nature of religion
 isamen sansaarik unnati tathaa nishshrey siddhi ke saadhan ko dharm mana gaya he
 Therefore, performing rituals of religion is essential for human welfare
 is darshan main dravya, gun, karm, saamaanya, vishesh or samavaay in chha: padaathon ke sadharmy tathaa vaidharmy ke tatvadhan se moksh prapti maani jaati he
 Religion and lawfulness is a special method of knowledge, without which it is not possible to solve the misconceptions
 iske anusaar chaar pair hone se gaay-bhens ek nahin ho sakate
 Similarly, both Jiva and Brahm are conscious
 kintu is sadharmy se donon ek nahin ho sakate
 Also, this philosophy considers the Vedas to be the ultimate proof of being divine
 is darshan ke rachayita maharishi kapil hai
