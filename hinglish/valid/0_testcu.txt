 rafel par supreme court ke haalia aadesh par bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ko aalochana kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman called a press conference at the BJP headquarters in New Delhi and expressed her opinion on the matter
 nirmala sitaraman ne congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, 'ham sab acchhee tarah se jaanate hai ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne ek jajment kaa ek paragraph bhi nahin padhaa hoga
 But, Rahul's statement that the court has accepted the petition and the court has also said that the watchman is a thief, it falls under the category of contempt of court
 'nirmala sitaraman ne rahul gandhi kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki jo vyakti khud bel par he or raajnneetik maryaada ke har siddhant ko todta he vah aise aarope laga rahaa he jiske bare main court ne kuch kaha hi nahin
 Nirmala Sitharaman said, 'in December 2018, the Supreme Court, in its judgment, denied the irregularities in the Rafale deal process
 adaalat ne us vakt deal ko chunauti dene vaali yachikaayen khaarij kar di thim
 This order of the Supreme Court also mentioned the price of Rafale planes, the process of their purchase
 lekin us aadesh ke baad kuch purv kendriya mantriyon or vakeelon ne kuch dastavejon ke aadhaar par is faisle ke khilaaf punarvichaar yachikaayen daayar kin
 Thereafter, some incorrectly acquired documents were partially published in some newspapers and magazines
 in dastavejon ko aadhaar banaakar yachikakartaon ne supreme court main apil kii jise ab supreme court ne sakshya mana he
 The Supreme Court may consider it to reconsider its decision in December 2018
 punarvichaar yachika par sunwaayee abhi bhavishya main hogi
 If there is a hearing in the Supreme Court, then the documents obtained wrongly will also be seen during the hearing
 court main bas yahi he
 But Congress President Rahul Gandhi's comment on the Supreme Court's decision is objectionable
 'rafel deal par supreme court ke faisle ke baad rahul gandhi ke taatkaalik bayaan kaa bhi zikr kiya
 Rahul Gandhi had said that the Supreme Court has accepted that the watchman has committed theft
 supreme court ne mana he ki rafel maamle main koi na koi bhrashtachar jarur hua he
 The Prime Minister of India has stolen the Air Force money and given it to Anil Ambani
 is par main spasht karnaa chaahati hum ki unhone supreme court kii avmaananaa kii he

 Significantly, the central government has suffered a setback in the Rafael Deal case
 supreme court ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki rafel deal main gopneey dastavejon kii galat tareeke se lee gai photocopi ke aadhaar par punarvichaar yachika par sunwaayee hogi
 In contrast, the Modi government opposed the reconsideration petition, saying that the documents which are being made the basis of the petition, cannot be considered as evidence under Section 123 of the Indian Evidence Act
 supreme court ne centre kii is aapatti par apana faisla 14 march ko surakshit rakh liya tha, lekin 10 april ko court ne kaha ki in dastavejon ko sunwaayee main shaamil kar sakate hai
 In fact, after nominating Amethi, Congress President Rahul Gandhi attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha tha ki supreme court ne bhi ab maan liya he ki rafel deal main ghotaalaa hua tha, vah pradhanmantri ko bhrashtachar par bahes karne kii chunauti dete hai
 Rahul Gandhi said that even the Supreme Court has accepted that the watchman has committed theft

 You can't get luckier!a post shared by Divyanka Tripathi Dahiya (@divyankatripathidahiya) on Aug 7, 2017 at 4:08am PDT Describing Sanskrit as the soul of India, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that if we work to connect the broken links of this ancient language and carry forward the multidisciplinary initiative, then the current knowledge system in Sanskrit and the amazing ability to enrich Indian languages is
 manmohan singh ne kaha, ‘sanskrit ko duniya kii sabase pracheen jeevant bhashaaon main se ek mana jaataa he, lekin is bhashaa ke bare main aisi galat dharna ban gai he ki yah keval dharmik shlokon or ritiyon se judi hui he
 Such a belief is an injustice to the works of Kautilya, Charak, Aryabhatta, Sushruta, Varahamihira, Brahmagupta, Bhaskaracharya and other poets, thinkers, writers and saints, and an injustice to this great language
 ’pandrahawein sanskrit sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha ki sanskrit ne na keval duniya ko kuch mahatvapurn kavy, granth aadi diye hai balki ganit, vanaspati vigyaan, chikitsa, kala or manviki ke kshetra main yah gyaan kaa khajaana he
 Singh said, 'if we take the broken links of this ancient language and take forward the multidisciplinary initiative, Sanskrit has the amazing ability to enrich the current knowledge system and Indian languages
 ’ vasudaiv kutumbakam ke siddhant ko sanskrit kii dein bataate hue pradhanmantri ne kaha ki bharat kii sa5yata kii tarah sanskrit kisi ek jati, dharm yaa sampradaay kii bhashaa nahin he
 Rather, it represents a culture that symbolizes the broad idea of being open, tolerant and embracing everyone above Shudra and racial thinking
 singh ne kaha ki sanskrit bhashaa ko lokapriy banane ke uddeshy se lacheela evam anaupchaarik course pesh kiye gaye hai
 Sanskrit is being taught as a vocational education course through traditional schools so that it can be linked to employment
 unhone kaha ki maukhik vaidic shiksha ko sangrakshit karne or iskaa vikaas karne kaa kaary bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 The Prime Minister said, 'several measures have been taken to encourage the study of Sanskrit language
 sanskrit bhashaa padhaane vaale aadhunik skulon ko vittiya sahaayta pradaan kii ja rahi he
 Voluntary organizations are also being encouraged in this direction
 ’singh ne kaha ki vishvavidhyalayon main sanskrit vibhaagon ko vishvavidhyalay anudaan ayog kii vibhinn yojanaon ke tahat vitt poshan kiya ja rahaa he
 Financial help is also being provided to those who publish newspapers and magazines in Sanskrit language
 aadhunik bhartiya bhashaaon ke shabdkosh ke liye sanskrit par nirbharta ko rekhaankit karte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha ki sanskrit se sambandhit behatar anuwaad tantra or computer saftware taiyaar karne kii jarurat he
 Can you ever set your car on fire by yourself, the question is puzzling
 lekin hakeekat janenge to hairaan rah jaaenge
 To bake political bread, an MNS leader set his own car on fire and created a ruckus in Mumbai on Wednesday
 ensipi or emenes ke bich hui bhidat ke dauraan mumbai kii sadak par ek car jalaai gai thi
 The clash was between NCP and MNS and the poor had to sacrifice the car
 lekin siyasat kii is aag kaa sach jab saamne aayaa to pataa chalaa ki muhabbat or jang kii tarah siyasat main bhi sab kuch mumkin he
 This car belonged to Mustakim Ahmed, a leader of MNS
 is agnikand se ek din pehle hi mustakim sahab ne 35 hajaar rupye main ye car kharidi thi
 And the next day, with full planning, the car was brought to Kurla and set on fire

 Many shocking decisions have been taken regarding the World Cup squad and in this sequence, the Indian team management can try Tamil Nadu all-rounder Vijay Shankar in the fourth position in the upcoming tournament
 isse pehle bhi 2003 vishwa cap main bhartiya team ne diggaj vivies lakshmana kii jagah dinesh karthik ko mauka diya tha, jo spin gendbaaji karne vaale harfanmaulaa khilaadi the
 In the 2011 World Cup in India, Yuvraj Singh played the fifth bowler and managed to take 15 wickets in the tournament

 It may have been exposed in the first three weeks of the Indian Premier League
 vishwa ke liye team kii ghoshnaa 15 se 20 april ke bich ho sakati he
 However, it is learned that the Indian team management is satisfied with Shankar's technique and more importantly, he can withstand the pressure situation
 is number par ballebaaji ke liye shankar ko sabase badi chunauti ambati raidu se milegi
 Rayudu has an average of more than 47 in odis, but he is not in rhythm
 ye bhi padhein- do diggajon ne mana- team india main chauthe number kaa 'sirdard' bhagaayenge pantatim se jude ek sutara ne mangalvaar ko pitiai se kaha, ‘yah saaf he ki raidu ne wellington main 90 ranon kii pari khilne ke baad us tarah kaa pradarshan nahin kiya, jisase un par bharosa kiya ja sake
 If he does well in the IPL, then things may change for him
 lekin unke bare main aam dharna he ki unhone jo bhi badi paariyaan kheli hai unamem zyaadaatar kamjor gendbaaji ke khilaaf hai
 'the advantage with Shankar is that he can hit a big shot at any time and can also bowl at least five overs
 unhone kaha, ‘shankar ko team main shaamil karne ko lekar do tarah se dekha ja saktaa he
 The advantage is that he is capable of rotating strikes and playing big shots
 wellington main unhone dikhaaya ki vah swing gendbaaji kaa bhi achche se saamana kar sakate hai
 The thing that goes against him is that he has played only 9 odis
 ’hardik pandya team main saatven kram par ballebaaji karenge or paanchaven gedbaaj kaa kota unke saath shankar or kedaar jadhav ko puraa karnaa hoga
 Captain Virat Kohli said after the ODI series against Australia, “we have almost decided the team combination

 Mithali has targeted coach Ramesh Powar
 unhone powar par bhedbhaavpurn niti akhriyaar karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 There is also talk of humiliation
 mitali ne dyna edulaji par bhi aarope lagaae hai
 Mithali Raj has written, 'the coach told me not to come on the field for the match against Australia
 match ke baad coach ne kaha- baahar baithkar or team se drop hone ke baad kaisaa mahasoos ho rahaa he
 '35-year-old Mithali has written to the BCCI that Diana Edulji, a member of the Committee of Administrators (COA), has misused her position
 mitali ne kaha, 'dyna edulaji ne mujhe bulaayaa or meri peeth main chura ghonpane vaala kaam kiya or mere saath jo kuch bhi kiya gaya use uchit tehraaya
 'mithali had to get out expensive, Haranmanpreet said - don't regret it
 In a letter to BCCI CEO Rahul Johri and Cricket Operations General Saba Karim, he said,' For the first time in my 20-year-long career, i felt humiliated
 mujhe yah sochane par majaboor hona padaa ki desh ke liye meri sevaaon kii ahmiyat satta main maujuud kuch logon ke liye he bhi yaa nahin yaa ve meraa aatmavishvaas khatm karnaa chaahate hai

 i never thought that she would misuse her position against me
 khaskar tab, jabaki westeindies main jo kuch mere saath hua, main unhen bataa chuki thi
 He said, 'I am deeply saddened by his support for the decision to keep me out of the semi-finals because he knew the reality
 ’powar ke bare main unhone kaha ki aisi kai ghatnaayen huin, jab apamaanit mahasoos kiya
 Mithali said, "if i am sitting around somewhere, he used to go out or see others while batting on the net, but i don't stop when i am batting
" main unase baat karne jaati, to phone dekhne lagate yaa chale jate
 "it was quite humiliating and i could not lose my temper despite seeing that i was being insulted," Mithali said, "I also talked to the team manager when the situation was uncontrollable, But after that the situation got worse
 coach ke liye maano main team main thi hi nahin
 Mithali said Powar asked him not to come on the field in the match against Australia
 mitali ne aage kaha,‘shaam ko team baithak ke baad ramesh ne mere kamare main phone kiya or kaha ki maidan par nahin aana, kyonki vahaan media hoga
 i was shocked at what the media had to deal with by being with my team
 hamaare sabase bade match main mujhe apni team se alag rahane ko kaha gaya
 'it is noteworthy that Indian women's T20 captain Harmanpreet Kaur and ODI captain Mithali Raj have met BCCI officials
 mitali ko tii-20 vishwa cap semifinal main feet hone ke baavjood antim-11 se baahar baitha diya gaya tha
 Harmanpreet Kaur appeared to justify this decision even after India's eight wicket haul in the semi-finals
 is vivaad par donon varisht khilaadi or manager tripti bhattacharya pichley dinon bisisiai siio rahul johri or jiem sabaa kareem se milin
 When Mithali was dismissed, the manager described Harmanpreet as a 'liar', Mithali was out due to a knee injury in the match against Australia in the tournament, but she had played consecutive fifties innings in the two matches played before that
 semifinal match se ek din pehle unhen feet ghoshit kar diya gaya tha
 Despite this, his management decided to retain the last XI which won against Australia by sitting on the bench
