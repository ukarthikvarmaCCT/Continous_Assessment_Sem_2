 Jalal Uddin Mohammad Akbar was the third ruler of the Mughal dynasty of the Timurid lineage
 akbar ko akbar-i-aazam, shahenshaah akbar, mahabali shahenshaah ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Emperor Akbar was the grandson of Zaheeruddin Muhammad Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, and the son of Nasiruddin Humayun and Hamida Bano
 babar kaa vansh taimur or mongol netaa changez khan se sambandhit tha arthath uske vanshaj taimur langs ke khandaan se the or matrupaksh kaa sambandh changez khan se tha
 By the end of Akbar's rule in 1605, the Mughal Empire consisted mostly of northern and central India and was one of the most powerful empires of the time
 baadshahon main akbar hi ek aisa badshaah tha, jise hindu muslim donon virgon kaa baraabar pyaar or sammaan mila
 He established a religion called din-i-ilahi to reduce the distance between hindu-muslim sects
 uskaa darbar sabake liye har samay khulaa rahata tha
 In his court, there were more Hindu chieftains than Muslim chieftains
 akbar ne hinduon par lagane vaala jazia hi nahin samaapt kiya, balki aise anek kaary kiye jinke kaaran hindu or muslim donon uske prashansak bane
 Akbar was sitting on the throne of Delhi after the death of his father Naseeruddin Muhammad Humayun at the age of just thirteen
 apane shashan kaal main usne shaktishaalee pashtun vanshaj shershah suri ke akraman bilkul band karvaa diye the, saath hi panipat ke dwitiya yuddh main navghoshit hindu raja hemu ko parajeet kiya tha
 It took Akbar two decades to form his empire and bring all the regions of northern and central India into unilateral authority
 uskaa prabhaav lagbhag puure bhartiya upmahadweep par tha or is kshetra ke ek bade bhubhag par samraat ke rup main usne shashan kiya
 As emperor, Akbar made diplomatic relations with powerful and majority Hindu Rajput kings and also married them
 akbar ke shashan kaa prabhaav desh kii kala evam samskruti par bhi padaa
 He showed a lot of interest in fine arts such as painting and the walls of his palace were filled with beautiful paintings and samples
 mughal chitrakaari kaa vikaas karne ke saath saath hi usne europea style kaa bhi swaagat kiya
 He was also interested in literature and had got many Sanskrit manuscripts and texts translated into Persian and Persian texts into Sanskrit and Hindi
 anek farsi samskruti se jude chitron ko apane darbar kii deevaaron par bhi banwaaya
 During his early rule, Akbar did not have tolerance towards Hindus, but over time he changed himself and showed great interest in other religions including Hindus
 usne hindu rajput rajkumariyon se vaivaahik sambandh bhi banaaye
 There were many Hindu courtiers, military officers and feudatories in Akbar's court
 usne dharmik charchaaon va vaad-vivaad kaaryakramon kii anokhi shrunkhlaa aarambh kii thi, jisamen muslim aalim logon kii jain, sikh, hindu, charvak, naastik, yahudee, portugali evam catholic isai dharmashastriyon se charchaaen hua karti thim
 He had respect for these religious leaders, which did not affect his personal religious feelings at all
 usne aage chalakar ek naye dharm deen-e-ilaahi kii bhi sthapana kii, jisamen vishwa ke sabhi pradhan dharmon kii nitiyon va shikshaaon kaa samavesh tha
 Unfortunately, this religion ended with the death of Akbar
 itane bade samraat kii mrityu hone par uski antyeshti bina kisi sanskaar ke jaldi hi kar di gayi
 Traditionally, a passage was made by breaking the wall in the fort and his body was quietly buried in the tomb of Sikandra
 akbar kaa janm poornima ke din hua tha isliye unka naam badaruddin mohammad akbar rakhaa gaya tha
 Badr means Full Moon and Akbar was derived from his maternal grandfather Sheikh Ali Akbar Jami
 kaha jaataa he ki kabul par vijay milane ke baad unke pita humayun ne buree nazar se bachane ke liye akbar kii janm tithi evam naam badal die the
 It is also legend that the people of India honored him with the name Akbar for his successful and efficient governance
 arabi bhashaa me akbar shabd kaa arth "mahaan" yaa bada hota he
 Akbar was born on November 23, 1542 in Umerkot, Sindh, the palace of the Rajput ruler Rana Amarsal
 yahaan badshaah humayu apni haal kii vivaahita begum hamida bano begum ke saath sharan liye hue the
 Humayun named this son once in a dream, according to which he was named Jalaluddin Mohammad
 babar kaa vansh taimur or mongol netaa changez khan se tha yani uske vanshaj taimur langs ke khandaan se the or matrupaksh kaa sambandh changez khan se tha
 Thus Akbar's arteries were a mixture of the blood of two of Asia's most famous races, the Turks and the Mongols
 humayun ko pashtun netaa shershah suri ke kaaran faras main agyatavaas bitaana pad rahaa tha
 But he did not take Akbar with him, but left him in Mukundpur, a village in the kingdom of Rewa
 akbar kii vahaan ke rajkumaar ram singh pratham se, jo aage chalakar rivaan kaa raja bana, ke sang gahari mitrataa ho gayi thi
 They grew up together and grew and remained lifelong friends
 kalantar main akbar safaavi samrajya main apane ek chachaa mirza askari ke yahaan rahane laga
 He first stayed in Kandahar for a few days and then in Kabul from 1545
 humayun kii apane chote bhaaiyon se baraabar thani hi rahi isaliye chachaa logon ke yahan akbar kii sthiti bandi se kuch hi acchhee thi
 However, all were well with him and probably loved affectionately too much
 kintu akbar pard likh nahin sakaa vah keval sainya shiksha le sakaa
 He spent a lot of time in games, races and duality, wrestling, etc
, and he was not interested in education
 jab tak akbar aath varsh kaa hua, janm se lekar ab tak uske sabhi varsh baari asthirataa main nikle the jiske kaaran uski shiksha-diksha kaa sahi prabandh nahin ho paaya tha
 Now Humayun's attention also went towards this
 lagbhag navambar, +--9-9 main usne akbar kii shiksha prarambh karne ke liye kabul main ek aayojan kiya
 But on the occasion, Akbar lost the ceremony on the second day
 mullah jaada mullah asamuddin abrahim ko akbar kaa shikshak niyukt kiya gaya
 But Mulla Asmuddin proved incompetent
 tab yah kaary pehle moulana bamjid ko saunpa gaya, magar jab unhen bhi safalataa nahin mili to moulana abdul kaadir ko yah kaam saunpa gaya
 But none of the teachers succeeded in educating Akbar
 asal main, padhane-likhane main akbar kii ruchi nahin thi, uski ruchi kabutar baaji, ghudsawaari or kute paalane main adhik thi
 But he was always interested in learning
 kaha jaataa he, ki jab vah sone jaataa tha, ek vyakti use kuch pard kar sunaata rahta tha
 Over time, Akbar emerged as a mature and discerning ruler with a keen interest in art, architecture, music and literature
 shershah suri ke putr islam shah ke uttaradhikaar ke vivaadon se utpann araajaktaa kaa laabh uthaa kar humayun ne 1555 main dilli par punah adhikaar kar liya
 In this, a good part of his army was the Persian ally Tahmasp I
 iske kuch maah baad hi 48 varsh kii aayu main hi humayun kaa aakasmik nidhan apane pustkaalay kii seedhi se baari nashe kii halaat main girane ke kaaran ho gaya
 Then Akbar's mentor Bairam Khan kept this death hidden for some time in the interest of the empire and prepared Akbar for succession
 14 farvari, 1556 ko akbar kaa rajtilak hua
 All this happened during the ongoing war with Sikander Shah Suri for the return of authority on the throne of Delhi from the Mughal Empire
 13 varshiya akbar kaa kalnaur, punjab main sunahare vastra tathaa ek gahare rang kii pagadi main ek navnirmit manch par rajtilak hua
 This platform remains even today
 use farsi bhashaa main samraat ke liye shabd shahenshaah se pukaara gaya
 Until adulthood, his kingdom remained under the protection of Bairam Khan
 khoye hue rajya ko punah praapt karne ke liye akbar ke pita humayun ke anwarat praytn antat safal hue or vah san 1555 main hindustan pahunch sakaa kintu agle hi varsh san 1556 main rajdhani dilli main uski mrityu ho gai or gurdaspur ke kalnaur naamak sthaan par 14 varsh kii aayu main akbar kaa rajtilak hua
 Bairam Khan, the patron of Akbar, was appointed whose influence remained on him till 1560
 tatkaaleen mughal rajya keval kabul se dilli tak hi failaa hua tha
 Along with this, many problems were also raised
 1563 main shamsuddin atka khan kii hatya par ubhara jan aakrosh, 1564-65 ke bich uzbek vidroh or 1566-67 main mirza bhaaiyon kaa vidroh bhi tha, kintu akbar ne badi kushalta se in samasyaon ko hal kar liya
 He increased his feudal power through his creativity
 isi bich 1566 main maham anka naamak uski dhai ke banawaaye madrase se shahar lautate hue akbar par tir se ek jaanaleva hamalaa hua, jise akbar ne apni furti se bachaa liya, haalanki uski baanh main gaharaa ghaav hua
 After this incident there was some change in Akbar's Prashan style under which he took full reins of governance
 iske fouran baad hi hemu ke netritv main afgaan sena punah sangathit hokar uske sammukh chunauti banakar khadi thi
 In the early period of his rule, Akbar understood that he would not be able to rule peacefully without ending the Suri dynasty
 isliye vah suri vansh ke sabase shaktishaalee shaasha sikandar shah suri par akraman karne punjab chal padaa
 He handed over the rule of Delhi to Mughal commander Tardi Bag Khan
 sikandar shah suri akbar ke liye bahut bada pratirodh sabit nahi hua
 In some regions, his army used to retreat even before Akbar arrived
 akbar kii anupasthiti me hemu vikramaditya ne dilli or agra par akraman kar vijay praapt kii
 On 6 October 1556 Hemu declared himself the Maharaja of India
 isi ke saath dilli me hindu rajya kii punah sthapana hui
 When Akbar got the news of Delhi's defeat, he immediately made an intention to travel to Delhi after consulting Bairam Khan
 akbar ke salaahkaaro ne use kabul kii sharan main jane kii salaah di
 There was a war in Panipat between Akbar and Hemu's army
 yah yuddh panipat kaa dwitiya yuddh ke naam se prasiddh he
 Despite being small in number, Akbar won in this war
 is vijay se akbar ko 1500 hathi mili jo manakot ke hamale main sikandar shah suri ke viruddh kaam aae
 Sikandar Shah Suri surrendered and Akbar surrendered him
 dilli par punah adhikaar jamaane ke baad akbar ne apane rajya kaa vistaar karnaa shuru kiya or malwa ko 1562 main, gujarat ko 1572 main, bengal ko 1574 main, kabul ko 1581 main, kashmir ko 1586 main or khandesh ko 1601 main mogul samrajya ke adheen kar liya
 Akbar appointed one governor each in these states
 akbar yah nahi chahta tha kii mogul samrajya kaa kendra dilli jaise duurastha shahar main ho; isliye usne yah nirnay liya kii mogul rajdhani ko fatehpur sikri le jaaya jaae jo samrajya ke madhya main thi
 Shortly after, Akbar had to be removed from the capital Fatehpur Sikri
 kaha jaataa he ki pani kii kami iskaa pramukh kaaran tha
 After Fatehpur Sikri, Akbar created a mobile court that used to roam across the empire, thus it was possible to pay proper attention to all the corners of the empire
 san 1585 main uttar pashchimi rajya ke sucharu raaj paalan ke liye akbar ne lahore ko rajdhani banaaya
 Before his death, Akbar made Agra the capital back in 1599 and ruled from there till the end
 san 1560 main akbar ne swayan satta sambhaal lee or apane sangrakshak bairam khan ko nikaal baahar kiya
 Now Akbar had power in his hands but also had many difficulties
 jaise - shamsuddin atka khan kii hatya par ubhara jan aakrosh, uzbek vidroh or mirza bhaaiyon kaa vidroh kintu akbar ne badi kushalta se in samasyaon ko hal kar liya
 He increased his feudal power through his creativity
 san 1562 main amer ke shaasha se usne samjhauta kiya - is prakaar rajput raja bhi uski ore ho gayi
 Similarly, he also gave big help to those coming from Iran
 bhartiya musalamaanon ko bhi usne apane kushal vyavhaar se apni ore kar liya
 He gave a unique introduction to religious tolerance - the Jiziya was removed by putting Hindu places of pilgrimage
 isse puure rajyavasiyon ko anubhav ho gaya ki vah ek parivartit niti apnaane main sakasham he
 In addition, he also forcibly stopped the conversion of prisoners of war
 akbar ne apane shasankaal main taanben, chaandi evam sone kii mudraayen prachlit kii
 There was beautiful Islamic printing on the back of these postures
 akbar ne apane kaal kii mudraao main kai badlaav kiye
 He introduced an open mint system in which if any person was able to pay the mint fee, he could change the currency of Akbar from another currency or gold
 akbar chahta tha ki uske puure samrajya main samaan mudra chale
 After the Second War of Panipat, Akbar regained Delhi by killing Hemu
 iske baad usne apane rajya kaa vistaar karnaa shuru kiya or malwa ko 1562 main, gujarat ko 1572 main, bengal ko 1574 main, kabul ko 1581 main, kashmir ko 1586 main or khandesh ko 1601 main mogul samrajya ke adheen kar liya
 Akbar appointed one governor each to handle the administration in these states
 use raaj sanbhaalane ke liye dilli kai sthanon se dur laga or ye prathit hua ki isse prashasan main samasya aa sakati he, atah usne nirnay liya kii mogul rajdhani ko agra ke nikat fatehpur sikri le jaaya jaae jo samrajya ke lagbhag madhya main thi
 Akbar built a new city on an old settled village Sikri which was named Fatehabad or Fatehpur in the joy of his victory i
e
 Fatah
 jaldi hi ise puure vartmaan naam fatehpur sikri se bulaayaa jane laga
 Most of the constructions here are of the 14 years in which Akbar resided here
 shahar main shahi udyaan, aaraamgahen, saamanton va darbariyon ke liye awaas tathaa bacchon ke liye madrase banawaaye gaye
 According to Blair and Bloom, buildings within the city are of two major types - service buildings, such as caravanseri, mint, factories, large markets where vertical constructions of the southwest / north east axis are built and the second royal section, which includes India's largest There are collective mosques, as well as residential and administrative buildings called Daulatkhana
 ye pahari se kuch kone par sthit hai tathaa kibala ke saath ek kone banaati hai
 But this decision was not proved right and after some time Akbar had to be removed from the capital Fatehpur Sikri
 iske peeche pani kii kami pramukh kaaran tha
 After Fatehpur Sikri, Akbar created a mobile court that roamed throughout the empire and thus made it possible to pay proper attention to all the places of the empire
 baad main usne san 1585 main uttar pashchimi bhaag ke liye lahore ko rajdhani banaaya
 Before death, Akbar made the capital back to Agra in 1599 and ruled from there till the end
 agra shahar kaa nayaa naam diya gaya akbarabad jo samrajya kii sabase bada shahar bana
 The main part of the city was situated on the western bank of river Yamuna

 a new sandstone wall was built in 1565 by breaking the old boundary wall of the mortar-built city built by the Lodhi Empire
 angrez itihaaskaar yugal blair evam bloom ke anusaar is laal diwaar ke kaaran hi iskaa naam laal kila padaa
 He further writes that this fort was made somewhat semicircular on the map of the previous fort
 shahar kii ore se ise ek dohari suraksha diwaar ghere he, jiske baahar gahari khai bani he
 This double wall has Delhi Gate in the north and Amar Singh Gate in the south
 ye donon dwaar apane dhanushakar mehrab-rupi aalon va burjon tathaa laal va safed sangmarmar par neeli glemud tilon dwaara alankaran se hi pahachaane jate hai
 The present fort is built by Shah Jahan, grandson of Akbar
 isamen dakshini ore jahangiri mahal or akbar mahal hai
 Raj Bharmal, the Kachhwaha Rajput of Amber, entered Akbar's court shortly after taking over his kingdom
 inhone apni rajkumaari harkhaa bai kaa vivaah akbar se karwaanaa sweekaar kiya
 Jodha Bai shehzade Salim ke janm ke pashchaat called Maryam-uz-zamani
 uski mrityu 1623 main hui thi
 a mosque was built in Lahore in his honor by his son Jahangir
 bhaarmal ko akbar ke darbar main ooncha sthaan mila tha or uske baad uske putr bhagwant das or pautra maansingh bhi darbar ke oonche samant bane rahe
 The episodes of Hindu princesses getting married to Muslim kings took place long before Akbar, but after most marriages the two families did not have good relations and neither did the princesses ever return home
 haalanki akbar ne is maamle ko pichley prakarnon se alag rup diya, jahaan un raniyon ke bhaaiyon yaa pitaaon ko putriyon yaa bahanon ke vivahoparaant akbar ke muslim sasuraal waalon jaisaa hi sammaan mila karata tha, sivaay unke sang khaanaa khaane or prarthana karne ke
 Those Rajputs found good places in Akbar's court
 sabhi ne unhen vaise hi apanaaya tha sivaay kuch roodhiwaadee pariwaron ko chhodkar, jinhone ise apmaan ke rup main dekha tha
 Other Rajpur princely states also formed marital relations with Akbar, but there was no condition for marriage
 do pramukh rajput vansh, mewarh ke shishodiya or ranthambor ke hadha vansh in sambandhon se sadaa hi hatate rahe
 Raja Mansingh, a well-known courtier of Akbar, also took an affidavit from Akbar to Surjan Hodha, a Hadha king, whom Surjan Singh accepted on the condition that he would not marry any of his daughters with Akbar
 antatah koi vaivaahik sambandh nahin hue kintu surjan ko garh-katang kaa adhibhaar saunp kar sammanit kiya gaya
 Many other Rajput feudals also did not like to give daughters of their kings to the Mughals in the name of marriage
 garh sivaan ke rathore kalyandas ne motaa raja raav udaisingh or jahangir ko maarane kii dhamkee bhi di thi, kyonki udaisingh ne apni putree jodhabai kaa vivaah akbar ke putr jahangir se karne kaa nishchay kiya tha
 Akbar, having this knowledge, sent the royal forces to attack Kalyanadasa
 kalyandas us sena ke sang yuddh main kaam aayaa or uski striyon ne johar kar liya
 The political impact of these relations was significant
 haalanki kuch rajput striyon ne akbar ke haram main pravesh lene par islam sweekaar kiya, phir bhi unhen purna dharmik swatantraaa thi, saath hi unke sage-sambandhiyon ko jo hindu hi the; darbar main ucch-sthaan bhi mili the
 Through them, the sound of the masses reached Akbar's court
 darbar ke hindu or muslim darbariyon ke bich sampark badhane se aapasi vichaaron kaa aadan-pradaan hua or donon dharmon main sambhaav kii pragati hui
 This led to the confluence of the two bloods in the next generation, which also promoted harmony between the two sects
 parinamswaroop rajput mughalon ke sarvaadhik shaktishaalee sahaayak bane, rajput sainyadhikariyon ne mughal sena main rahakar anek yuddh kiye tathaa jite
 Among them was the 1572 campaign of Gujarat
 akbar kii dharmik sahishnutaa kii niti ne shahi prashasan main sabhi ke liye naukariyon or rojgaar ke avasar khol diye the
 Due to this, the administration became stronger
 tatkaaleen samaaj main veshyavriti ko samraat kaa sangrakshan pradaan tha
 He had a huge harem in which there were many women
 inamen adhikansh striyon ko balpurvak apahrit karvaa kar vahaan rakhaa hua tha
 Sati was also in full swing at that time
 tab kaha jaataa he ki akbar ke kuch log jis sundar stri ko sati hote dekhte the, balpurvak jaakar sati hone se roak dete va use samraat kii ajna bataate tathaa us stri ko haram main daal diya jaataa tha
 However, the court historians have said this case in some way that the King Salamat thus opposed the practice of Sati and gave protection to those Abla women
 apni jeevani main akbar ne swayan likhaa he– yadi mujhe pehle hi yah budhimatta jaagrit ho jaati to main apni sultanate kii kisi bhi stri kaa apharan kar apane haram main nahin laata
 It is clear from this that he used to kidnap the beauties
 iske alaava apharan na karwaane vaali baat kii nirarthakta bhi is tathy se gyaat hoti he ki na to akbar ke samay main or na hi uske utraadhikario ke samay main haram band hui thi
 According to Ain Akbari, Abdul Qadir Badauni says that wagons, nobles, wives of courtiers or other women whenever they wish to appear in the service of the emperor have to first give notice of their wish and wait for an answer; Those who are considered eligible are allowed to enter the harem
 akbar apni praja ko baadhya kiya karata tha kii vah apane ghar kii striyon kaa nagn pradarshan samuhik rup se yojit kare jise akbar ne khudaaroj naam diya hua tha
 Akbar's only purpose behind this celebration was to choose beauties for his harem
 
 Rani Durgavati of Gondwana also had Akbar's vision
 usne rani ko praapt karne ke liye uske rajya par akraman kar diya
 During the war, Veerangana realized that there was an attempt to capture him rather than kill him, so he committed suicide there
 tab akbar ne uski bahan or putrabadhu ko balpurvak apane haram main daal diya
 Akbar also practiced the practice that his defeated enemies send selected women from his family and hostess to his harem
 1556 main akbar ke gaddi lene ke samay, portugaliyon ne mahadweep ke pashchimi tat par bahut se durg va nirmaaniyan laga lee thim or bade str par us kshetra main nauvahan or sagariya vyapaar niyantrit karne lage the
 Due to this colonialism, all other merchant institutions were taught to remain impatient with the terms of the Portuguese, to which the rulers and traders of that time had begun to object
 mughal samrajya ne akbar ke rajtilak ke baad pehla nishaanaa gujarat ko banaaya or sagar tat par pratham vijay paayi 1572 main, kintu portugaliyon kii shakti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue pehle kuch varshon tak unase maatr faras kii khadi kshetra main yatra karne hetu kartaaz naamak paas liye jate rahe
 At the time of the acquisition of Surat in 1572, the Mughals and the Portuguese first met and the Portuguese perceived the real power of the Mughals and consequently thought it appropriate to act on policy rather than war, and the Portuguese governor, upon Akbar's instructions, gave him a treaty by an ambassador
 Sent proposal akbar ne us kshetra se apane haram ke va anya muslim logon dwaara makka ko haj kii yatra ko surakshit karne kii drushti se prastaav sweekaar kar liya
 In 1573, Akbar issued a decree to the administrative officials of Gujarat, ordering the Portuguese to be allowed to live peacefully in nearby Daman
 iske badale main portugaliyon ne akbar ke parivaar ke liye haj ko jane hetu paas jari kiye the
 In 1576, Akbar sent a large group of Hajis, including several members of his harem, under the leadership of Yahya Saleh to Haj
 ye jattha do poton main surat se jeddah bandargah par 1577 main pahunchaa or makka or madina ko agrasar hua
 Between 1577 and 1580, four more caravans left for Hajj, with which there were gifts for the people of Mecca and Medina and Sadak for the poor
 ye yatri samaaj ke aarthik rup se nichle varg ke the or inke jane se un shaharon par aarthik bhaar badha
 Then the Ottoman administration requested them to return home, on which the women of the harem were not ready
 kaaphi vivaad ke baad unhen vivash hokar lautnaa padhaa
 The Governor of Aden was enraged at the large number of travelers who arrived in 1580 and insulted the Mughals as much as possible while returning
 in prakarnon ke kaaran akbar ko hajiyon kii yatraaon par roak lagaani padi
 After 1584 Akbar planned to ascend the port of Aden, subordinate to the Kingdom of Yemen, with the help of the Portuguese
 portugaliyon se is bare main yojana banane hetu ek mughal doot goa main aktubar 1584 se sthaayee rup se tainaat kiya gaya
 In 1587 a Portuguese contingent also invaded Yemen but suffered defeat by the Ottoman navy
 iske baad mughal-portugali gathbandhan ko bhi dhakka pahunchaa kyonki mughal jagiradaaron dwaara janzira main portugaliyon par lagaataar dabaav daalaa ja rahaa tha
 Akbar was a Muslim, but he also had respect for other religions and sects
 jaise-jaise akbar kii aayu badati gai vaise-vaise uski dharm ke prati ruchi badhane lagi
 He is particularly known for his fondness for Hinduism
 usne apane purvajo se vipareet kai hindu rajkumariyon se shaadi kii
 Apart from this, Akbar also held Hindus in various princely positions in his state, which was not done by any former Muslim ruler
 vah yah jaan gaya tha ki bharat main lambe samay tak raaj karne ke liye use yahan ke mul nivaasiyon ko uchit evam barabari kaa sthaan dena chaiye
 The Jiziya on Hindus was removed by Akbar in 1562, but had to be withdrawn in 1575 due to opposition from Muslim leaders, although he later withdrew policyfully
 jazia kar garib hinduon ko garibi se vivash hokar islam kii sharan lene ke liye lagaaya jaataa tha
 It was not imposed on Muslim people
 is kar ke kaaran bahut si garib hindu jansankhya par boj padataa tha, jisase vivash ho kar ve islam kabool kar liya karte the
 Firoz Shah Tughlaq has described how Islam was spread by Jizya
 akbar dwaara jazia or hindu tirthon par lage kar hataane ke samayik nirnyon kaa hinduon par kuch khaas prabhaav nahin padaa, kyonki isse unhen kuch khaas laabh nahin hua, kyonki ye kuch antaraal baad waapas laga die gaye
 Akbar had converted many Hindus to Islam against his will, in addition to this, he also converted the names of many Hindu pilgrimage places, such as Prayag to Allahabad in 1583
 akbar ke shasankaal main hi uske ek sipahasaalar hossain khan tukriya ne hinduon ko balpurvak bhedbhaav darshak bille unke kandhon or baahon par lagane ko vivash kiya tha
 There is a legend about the Jwalamukhi temple
 yah 1542 se 1605 ke madhya kaa hi hoga tabhi akbar dilli kaa raja tha
 The meditated mother was the ultimate devotee of Jotawali
 ek baar devi ke darshan ke liye vah apane gaanvvaasiyo ke saath jwalaji ke liye niklaa
 When his convoy passed through Delhi, the Mughal Emperor Akbar's soldiers stopped him and presented him in the court of King Akbar
 akbar ne jab dhyanu se poocha ki vah apane gaanvvaasiyon ke saath kahaan ja rahaa he to uttar main dhyanu ne kaha vah jotavaali ke darshano ke liye ja rahe he
 Akbar said what strength does your mother have? And what can she do? Then Dhyanu said that she is going to protect the whole world
 aisa koi bhi kaary nahi he jo vah nahin kar sakati he
 Akbar cut the head of the horse of Dhyanu and said that if your mother has power, then add the head of the horse and make it alive
 yah vachan sunakar dhyanu devi kii stuti karne laga or apana sir kaat kar mata ko bhet ke rup main pradaan kiya
 The head of the horse was joined by the power of mother
 is prakaar akbar ko devi kii shakti kaa ehsaas hua
 Emperor Akbar also offered a gold umbrella in the temple of the goddess
 kintu uske man me abhimaan ho gaya ki wo sone kaa chhatra chadhaane laayaa he, to mata ne uske haath se chhatra ko girava diya or use ek ajeeb dhaatu kaa bana diya jo aaj tak ek rahasy he
 This canopy is still present in the temple
 itihaaskaar dasharath sharma bataate hai, ki ham akbar ko uske darbar ke itihaas or varnanon jaise akbarnama, aadi ke anusaar mahaan kehete hai
 If one looks at other notable works, such as Dalpat Vilas, then it will become clear how abusive Akbar used to treat his Hindu feudatories
 akbar ke navratna raja maansingh dwaara vishwanath mandir ke nirmaan ko akbar kii anumati ke baad kiye jane ke kaaran hinduon ne us mandir main jane kaa bahishkaar kar diya
 The reason was clear, that Raja Mansingh's family had marital relations with Akbar
 akbar ke hindu samant uski anumati ke bagaiyr mandir nirmaan tak nahin kara sakate the
 When King Mansingh started construction of a temple in Bengal without permission, Akbar stopped it when he came to know and in 1595 ordered him to convert it into a mosque
 akbar ke liye aakrosh kii had ek ghatana se pataa chalati he
 Raja Ram, a leader of Hindu peasants, attempted to rob Akbar's tomb, Sikandra, Agra, which was thwarted by the local faujdar, Mir Abul Fazal
 iske kuch hi samay baad 1688 main raja ram sikandra main dobaaraa prakat hua or shysta khan ke aane main vilamb kaa phayda uthaate hue, usne makbare par dobaaraa send lagaai or bahut se bahumoolya saamaan, jaise sone, chaandi, bahumoolya kaaleen, chiraag, ityadi lut liye, tathaa jo le ja nahin sakaa, unhen barbaad kar gaya
 King Rama and his men dug out and burnt the asbestos of Akbar, which was a subject of utter humiliation for the Muslims
 baad ke varshon main akbar ko anya dharmon ke prati bhi aakarshan hua
 Akbar's attachment to Hinduism was not only to solidify the Mughal Empire, but he had a personal interest in Hinduism
 hindu dharm ke alaava akbar ko shiya islam evam isai dharm main bhi ruchi thi
 He once called a Portuguese evangelist from Goa to learn the fundamental principles of Christianity
 akbar ne darbar main ek vishesh jagah banavaai thi jise ibaadat-khaanaa kaha jaataa tha, jahaan vah vibhinn dharmaguruon evam prachaarkon se dharmik charchaaen kiya karata tha
 His exploration of other religions was unbearable for some Muslim fundamentalists
 unhe lagane laga tha ki akbar apane dharm se bhatak rahaa he
 There was some truth in these things as well, Akbar sometimes took some decisions out of orthodox Islam, even in 1582 he started a new sect called din-i-ilahi i
e
 the religion of God
 deen-e-ilaahi naam se akbar ne 1582 main ek nayaa dharm banaaya jisamen sabhi dharmo ke mul tatwon ko daalaa, isame pramukhtah hindu evam islam dharm the
 Apart from these, the basic ideas of Parsi, Jain and Christianity were also included
 haalanki is dharm ke prachaar ke liye usne kuch adhik udyog nahin kiye keval apane vishwast logo ko hi isame sammilit kiya
 It is said that apart from Akbar, only King Birbal was a follower till his death
 dabestan-e-majahab ke anusaar akbar ke pashchaat keval 19 logo ne is dharm ko apanaaya
 Later, Akbar composed a new almanac in which he started a divine era which began on the day of his coronation
 usne tatkaaleen sikkon ke peeche ‘‘allaah-o-akbar’’ likhvaya jo anekaarthi shabd tha
 Akbar literally means "great" and the words "allah-o-akbar" could have two meanings "allah is great" or "akbar is Allah"
 deen-e-ilaahi sahi mino main dharm na hokar ek aachaar samhita ke samaan tha
 In this, indulgence, pride, slander or blaming were forbidden and were called sins
 dayaa, vichaarsheelataa or sanyam iske aadhaar stambh the
 It has been argued that din-i-ilahi's doctrine of having a new religion is a misconception, which was later born out of the mistranslation of Abul Fazl's works by British historians
 haalanki, yah bhi sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki sulah-e-kul kii niti, jisamen deen-i-ilaihi kaa saar tha, akbar ne keval dharmik uddeshyon ke liye nahin balki saamaanya shahi prashasnic niti kaa ek bhaag ke rup main apanaaya tha
 This formed the basis of Akbar's policy of religious sympathy
 1605 main akbar kii maut ke samay unke muslim vishyon main asantosh kaa koi sanket nahin tha, or abdul haq jaise ek dharamshastri kii dharna thi ki nikat sambandh bane rahe
 Despite being illiterate, Akbar had a special love for artists and intellectuals
 uske isi prem ke kaaran akbar ke darbar main nau ati gunwan darbari the jinhen akbar ke navratna ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Akbar's personality has been much talked about
 isliye bhartiya sahitya evam cinema ne akbar se prerit kai paatr rache gaye hai

 Adobe Illustrator was first developed for Apple Macintosh in 1986 as a commercialization of Adobe's internal font development software and postscript file format
 haalanki iske pehle dashak ke dauraan adobi ne mukhya rup se macintosh ke liye elstritor viksit kiya, chhitput rup se yah anya platefarm ko samarthan detaa rahaa
 In the early 1990s, Adobe released versions of Illustrator for NEXT, Silicon Graphics IRIX and Sun Solaris platforms but had to be discontinued due to lackluster market response

 hakim abul kasim firdausi tusi farsi kavi the
 He composed the Shahnama which later became the national epic of Persia
 isamen unhone saatvin sadi main faras par arabi fatah ke pehle ke iran ke bare main likhaa he
 Firdausi was born in 920 AD in a town called Tus in Khorasan
 asadi naamak kavi ne use shiksha di or kavita kii ore prerit kiya
 He gave him a treatise on the mythological kings of Iran, on the basis of which Firdausi composed the Shahnama
 isamen 60,000 sher hai
 He was busy with this great work for 35 years and completed it on 25 February 1010 AD
 is samay vah 85 varsh kaa ho chukaa tha
 He dedicated this poem to Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi who conquered Khorasan in 999 AD
 use keval 20 hajaar dirham pradaan kiye gaye
 Firdausi's body was set on fire
 vah apane desh se hiraat kii ore bhaaga kintu bhaagane se purv ek kavita shahname main jod gaya, jisamen sultan mahmud kii ghor ninda kii gai he
 In the Shahnama, Firdausi praised the legendary emperor of Iran, whose exploits he was greatly influenced by, the elder
 uski kavita se pracheen iran ke prati uskaa prem evam arabon ke prati ghrinaa kaa puraa abhas miltaa he
 In order to possibly satisfy the staunch Muslims, he later wrote Yusuf Zulikha, a masnavi dedicated to the Bavid ruler Bahauddaula and his son Sultanuddaula
 taduparant vah apni mathrubhumi toos laut aayaa or vahiin uski mrityu hui 
 His grave is in the sights of Iran
 kaha jaataa he, jab uskaa janaaza paas ke ek gaanv ke phatak se nikal rahaa tha, ek kaaravaan sultan mahmud ke bheje hue 60,000 dinar lekar pahunchaa jinaki kavi ko aashaa thi
 Firdausi's daughter put all the money in charity
 shahnamaa kii badi hi sundar sachitr hastlipiyaan sansar ke bade bade sangrahalayon main surakshit hai

 taduparant bharat or iran se anek sanskaran prakashit hue
 Its translations have been published in many languages of the world
 kaha jaataa he ki mahmud gazanvi ne firdausi ko yah vachan diya tha ki vah 'shahnamaa' ke har shabd ke liye ek dinar degaa
 After years of hard work, when the 'shahnama' was ready and Firdausi took him to the court of Mahmud Ghaznabi, the emperor paid him a dirham, not a dinar for every word
 kaha jaataa he is par naaraaz hokar firdausi laut gaya or usne ek dirham bhi nahin liya
 This promise was something like that a penny should be given to a poet by paying a rupee per word
 firdausi ne gusse main aakar mahmud gazanabi ke khilaaf kuch panktiyaan likhi
 Those lines were so influential that they spread throughout the empire
 kuch saal baad mahmud gazanvi se uske vishwaasapaatr mantriyon ne nivedan kiya ki firdausi ko usee dar par bhugtan kar diya jaye jo tay kii gayi thi
 When asked about the reason of the emperor, the Prime Minister said that in every corner of the empire we go, we get to hear the lines that Firdausi has written against you and we just bow down in shame
 use nirdhaarit dar par paisa de diya jaayegaa to hamen bada naitik bal milegaa
 The Emperor gave the order
 dinaaron se bhari gaadi jab firdausi ke ghar pahunchi to ghar ke andar se firdausi kaa janaaza nikal rahaa tha
 Firdausi was dead after spending his entire life in poverty, poverty and failure
 kehete hai ki firdausi kii ekmaatr santan uski ladki ne bhi yah dhan lene se inkaar kar diya tha
 In this way the emperor remained a debtor of the poet and still is today
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki aaj firdausi kaa shahnamaa jitna prasiddh he utani hi yaa usase zyada prasiddh ve panktiyaan he jo firdausi ne mahmud gazanabi kii aalochana karte hue likhi thim
 Firdausi's 'shahnama' is not only the history of Iran but the identity of Iranian identity
 usamen pracheen iran kii uplabdhiyon kaa bakhaan he
 Emperors have a history
 pracheen farsi granthon ko nayaa rup dekar unako shaamil kiya gaya he

 No other book has appeared in Iranian literature as often as 'shahnama' has been printed
 firdausi ne rustam or soharaab jaise paatr nirmit kiye hai jo maanav-smriti kaa hissaa ban chuke hai
 There is a beautiful garden around the tomb of Firdausi, as Iranians have done with their great poets

 Although some ancient writers have quoted from Arthashastra in their texts and mentioned Kautilya, this book was lost

 iske pashchaat is granth ke do hastlekh munich librari main praapt hue or ek sambhavat: kalakatta main
 Later several editions of Arthashastra were published by Sham Shastri, Ganapathi Shastri, Yaduvir Shastri etc

 With the publication of the book, there was a stir in India and western countries because it found a description of the wonderful elements of governance in which Indians were considered completely ignorant

 Kautilya's 'arthashastra' is an important work of political principles
 is sambandh main yah prashn uthta he ki kautilya ne apni pustak kaa naam 'arthshaastra' kyon rakhaa? prachinkaal main 'arthshaastra' shabd kaa prayog ek vyapak arth main hota tha
 Under this, the study of political science, theology, economics, law etc
 was originally done
 acharya kautilya kii drushti main raajnneeti shaastra ek swatantra shaastra he or anvikshiki, trayee tathaa vaarta env kanoon aadi uski shakhaayen hai
 The entire society is protected by politics or penal system or only the protected subjects can follow their duties
 us samay arthshaastra ko raajnneeti or prashasan kaa shaastra mana jaataa tha
 There is a context in this connection in the Mahabharata, in which Arjuna is considered an expert on economics
 nishchit rup se kautilya kaa arthshaastra bhi rajshastra ke rup main liya gaya hoga, yon usne arth kii kai vyakhyaayein kii hai
 Kautilya has said - Manushayanam vritirartha, that is to say, the meaning of the livelihood of human beings
 arthshaastra kii vyakhya karte hue usne kaha he—tasya pruthivya laabhpalnopaayah shaastramarth-shastramiti
 Thus, it is also clear that 'economics' includes principles related to both the polity and the economy
 vastutah kautilya 'arthshaastra' ko keval rajvyavastha or arthvyavastha kaa shaastra kahana upyukt nahin hoga
 In fact, it is the scripture related to economy, state, law, social system and religious system
 kautilya ke 'arthshaastra' ke purv or bhi kai arthshaastron kii rachana kii gayi thi, yadhyapi unki pandulipiyaan uplabdh nahin hai
 In India, since ancient times, efforts have been made for the combination and combination of meaning, work and religion and for this there are detailed discussions in the scriptures, memories and Puranas
 kautilya ne bhi 'arthshaastra' main arth, kaam or dharm kii prapti ke upayon kii vyakhya kii he
 In the 'kamasutra' of Vatsyayan, sources have been composed in relation to the meaning, religion and work
