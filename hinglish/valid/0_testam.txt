 Amidst these pressures, Baba promised the government that he would end his agitation on Saturday
 mantri atmamugdh ho gaye, unhone sochaa, haa unhone kar dikhaaya
 But the government's happiness was extinguished when Baba turned back on his promises
 baad main sarkaar ko ehsaas hua ki baba ne unhen hawaaon main yatra bhar kara di thi, lekin tab tak bahut der ho chuki thi
 Nearly 50 thousand people had gathered in Ramlila Maidan, this number was almost half of the people who gathered on Sunday the next day
 tab sarkaar ne plan bi ko saakaar rup diya
 Chidambaram gave orders to the security forces
 lekin iske vipareet kii mahatma gandhi kii tarah baba ramdev aatmasamarpan karen, unhone bachane ke liye shivaji kaa tarika apana liya
 His supporters did the same and 40 people were injured
 yah sarkaar kii ore se duusari sabase badi galati thi
 Baba had become the hero of the country
 sarkaar ko ghabraana nahin chahie tha
 The members of civil society, while showing foresight, kept themselves a little away from Baba Ramdev's movement after Sadhvi Ritbhanra sat on the dais
 ramdev kaa satyagrah anna hajaare ke anshan se alag tha
 This did not come as a natural reaction, but rather its outline had already been prepared
 baba kii maangon kii 'naa khatm hone vaali' ek suchi thi
 
 
 Which was also related to serious issues
 baba kii vaada khilaaphi or civil socity se duuri ne bhi hawa ke ruukh ko baba se dur kar diya tha
 But the government, surrounded by many scams, is constantly seen sitting on a dangerous mouth and it takes action only when its life is lost
 baba kaa vahaan se nikal bhaagane kii koshish bhi bada hi ashobhaneey rahaa
 Due to these headache works, the head of the government will continue to suffer for a long time
 or is kaaran hi bijepi ko bhi apni raajnneeti chamakaane kaa ek or mauka mil gaya he
 Ever since the 2G and Commonwealth Games scandals, the government seems to have failed to run the government completely
 baba maamle kii asafalataa ke baad sarkaar kaa apane aap main niyantran khota ja rahaa he
 Amidst all this, the Congress party itself is asking serious questions to the government
 aankade aaj bhi samprag sarkaar ke saath hai or najadik main usapar koi khatra banataa nahin dikh rahaa he
 But due to the changing developments, Manmohan Singh seems to be a little distant from his post of Prime Minister

 The Center has now taken a U-turn in the Supreme Court after not disclosing privacy as a fundamental right
 centre ne kaha ki privesi ke kuch pahaluon ko moulik adhikaron ke tahat sangrakshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Attorney General KK Venugopal, arguing on behalf of the Center in the confidentiality case, said that some aspects of privacy are protected under fundamental rights while others are only part of the common law

 But privacy does not have the status of a fundamental right
 ’rhite tu privesi ke maamle main varisht vakil kapil sibbal or atorni general keke venugopal ne apni baaten rakhi hai
 Let me tell you that this debate is on the matter of basis
 iske liye ek yachika daakhil kii gai thi, jisamen kaha gaya ki aadhaar se jodi jane vaali skim privesi ke adhikaar kaa hanan karti hai
 KK Venugopal said in the Supreme Court that there are many aspects of Right to Life including right to food, living and employment, but not all of them come under the fundamental authority

 It can be detected only by sitting miles away

 When the state accesses the data, it must be sanctioned by law and must be for a legitimate purpose

 Not joining the Modi cabinet of Janata Dal UK is affecting the politics of Bihar

 Janata Dal u believes that it is not having any effect and in the coming days, the opponents may have to face the face again
 vahiin, vipakshiyon kaa maananaa he ki iskaa bihar kii raajnneeti par gaharaa asar padegaa
 The latest example of this is Congress
 abhi tak congress vidhayak dal main tut hona tay mana ja rahaa tha
 Seeing this danger, Congress President Sonia Gandhi called the leaders of the Congress of Bihar, explained and extinguished and warned
 iske baavjood congress ke vidhayakon par iskaa khaas asar nahin dikhaa
 Because he has seen his future safe in the Janata Dal U, while he knows the meaning of standing with RJD
 kendriya mantrimandal ke is vistaramen janata dal you ko khaas tarjeeh nahin dene ke baad congress ke vidhayak tension main hai
 The steps which were going ahead on their own have stopped at the moment

 According to media reports, two ministers of the Janata Dal u were discussed to join the Union Cabinet, while there was no such proposal

 In such a situation, it is believed that the BJP is trying to strengthen its party by not strengthening its constituents
 congress vidhayakon kii chintaa kaa kaaran yahi he

 In December 1994, when my relationship with him (p
 ve
 Narasimha Rao) had become better together, one day he called me to meet him at his house at 5 Race Course Road
 ve apane swabhaav ke vipareet baichaiyn or pareshaan najar aa rahe the
 He told me, 'I can talk to Sonia Gandhi directly face to face
 lekin main aisa karnaa nahin chahta
 Some of his advisers are filling their ears against me
 main unhen gambhirtha se nahin letaa lekin sonia kaa maamla alag he
 His behavior towards me is affecting my health
 agar ve chaahati hai ki main pad chhod duun to unhen bas kehane bhar kii jarurat he or main vahi karuunga
 i have tried everything possible to fulfill their aspirations and needs
 aap unke saath kaam karte hai or jaanate honge ki sonia kaa mere prati itnaa virodh kyon he
 "as the Vice President of the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust and the Secretary of the Nehru Memorial Fund, my meeting with Sonia Gandhi was limited to conversations related to the activities of these two institutions
 raajnneeti se jude masalon par meri unke saath charchaa virale hi hoti he or yahi baat maine narsingh raav ko bataai
 Yes, i was aware of one thing and that she was not happy with the slow pace of the trial of Rajiv Gandhi's killers
 is par pi
 V
 kaa jawaab tha ki unhone sabhi jaruri kagajaat ke saath pi
 Chidambaram was sent to Sonia
 unhone grih mantri es
 B
 chavaan ko bhi maamle kii taaja sthiti kii jaankaree dene ke liye sonia ke paas bheja tha
 And as Narasimha Rao pointed out, eventually he himself went to Sonia Gandhi with the necessary files and informed her about the legal complexities related to Mudakme, which caused Mudkama to fail
 narsingh raav ke mutabik, sonia ne sari baat suni lekin kaha kuch nahin
 He said, "you know, i have tried to be polite to him
 ham vahi karte hai jo ve chaahati hai
 But they never telephoned me
 nehru fund ke trustiyon ke saath baithak ke baad ek din maine unase kaha ki main 10 janpath par rex phone lagava duungaa taaki ve jab chahen mujhase baat kar saken
 He also agreed
 lekin ghantebhar baad unhone sandesh bhijwaya ki unhen rex phone nahin chahie
 It was like slapping my face
 ” On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Mumbai attacks, Defense Minister AK Antony has said that the terror attack 'reminds' of the unstable neighborhood and hence the need to constantly monitor
 antni ne kaha ki desh sankalp letaa he ki raashtra main kabhi 26 / 11 jaisaa hamalaa dobaaraa nahin hoga
 He said, "mumbai's terrorist attack reminds us of the volatile and dangerous situation of our neighbor, so there is a need to constantly monitor
" ’’ apane sandesh main antni ne kaha ki unki bhavanaaen 26 / 11 hamalon main maare gaye logon or aatankwaadiyon ke saath ladate hue shahid hone vaale surakshakarmiyon ke saath hai
 'anti Romeo Squad' Yes, it was the name that was woven back and forth in the 2017 assembly elections
 2017 ke chunaav main mili baari jeet ke baad is 'anti romeo squad' ko yogi sarkaar ne apana sabase bada trump card bhi banaaya
 But by the year, the anti-romeo squad has been missing from government achievements
 yogi sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon kii fehrist main anti romeo squad ke kaam or aankadon ko jagah nahin mili jabaki isaki jagah encounter squad ke aankadon ne le lee he
 It was made to stop molesting girls and women
 Tell us that soon after Yogi took power, BJP in the state had implemented the promise of making anti-romeo squad
 bijepi ne sankalp patr main mahilaon ke saath chhedhkhani rokane ke liye anti romeo dasta banane kii baat kahi thi
 The police had carried out this campaign outside the park, crowded place and school-college to catch the menace and to stop molesting the girls
 yogi sarkaar ke siyaasi safar kaa aaj ek saal puraa ho gaya he
 The government has presented figures of its achievements
 lekin anti romeo squad kii kahin koi charchaa nahin he
 After a year, now the government claims that a centralized application for anti-romeo squad will be implemented
 anti romeo squad kii jagah encounter ke aankadegauratlab he ki march 2017 ko jab sarkaar bani tab yogi adityanath kii sarkaar ne anti romeo squad ko sabase zyada majboot karne or saarvajanik jagahon par mahilaon ke saath hone vaale chhedchhad ko rokane ke liye iske gathan ko hari jhandi di
 With the number of anti-romeo squads declining by one year, the figures of the encounter have taken place in the achievements of the government
 anti romeo squadpichley saal sarkaar ne har thane main ek sab inspector ke netritv main anti romeo squad banane kaa elaan kiya tha, shuru main chowk-chauraahon or ladakiyon ke skool college ke baahar saadi vardi main yah squad tainaat bhi dikhataa tha lekin lekin din-hafte or maheene bitne ke saath-saath anti romeo squad bhi apni maarak kshamta khota gaya
 The reason was a huge lack of police force
 is anti romeo squad ke tahat har thane main ek sab inspector ke tahat 4 constablon ke saath ek team banaai gai he jo har thana kshetra ke ladakiyon ke skool college ke baahar saadi vardi main nazren banaakar rakhata tha lekin shuruaati kaarywai ke baad ab isaki unit dikhaai nahin detii
 Anti Romeo Squad is alive in papers anti-romeo squad is alive even today and its unit remains in almost all the police stations
 lekin aaj hakeekat he ki kai thanon main iskaa koi namonishaan nahin he
 The reason is the lack of police force
 haalanki anti romeo squad ke naam par moral pulising ko rokane main police prashasan safal rahaa he
 But now these squads are not seen outside colleges, nor do people seem to discuss it
 shuruyaat main anti romeo squad kadai se manchalon or chhedhkhani karne waalon se nipta tha saarvajanik rup se bhi kai log pakade gaye
 Although several incidents of moral policing were also reported, but gradually the anti-romeo squad became just a name and its people were deployed in other police forces and police stations
 pichley kai maheenon se anti romeo squad ke aankade saamne nahin aae hai lekin sarkaar kaa daawa he ki anti romeo squad acha kaam kar rahaa he or jald hi isane kai or badlaav kiye jaaenge
 When the anti-romeo team started working, questions were also raised about the functioning of the police
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki baad main is tarah kii squad kii sakriyata kam dikhi
 But it is not even mentioned in the achievements of the Yogi government
 haryana ke kurushetra jile main ek naaballig ladki kii uske ghar main hi berahami ke saath hatya kar di gai

 Deputy Commissioner of Police Rajnarayan Kaushal said that when the girl returned home, there were no parents in the house
 tabhi ghar main pehle se chhipe ek hamalavar ne penchkas se us par hamalaa kar diya
 Because of which the girl fell on the floor in a bloody and shortly after
 hatya kii vaardaat ko anjaam dekar aaropee maukey se faraar ho gaya
 When the mother returned home, seeing the house, her senses flew away
 soochna milane par police maukey par pahunch gai or ladki laash ko kabje main le liya
 After preliminary investigation by the police, it is feared that it may be a rape case
 police upayukta rajanarayan kaushal ne bataaya ki ladki kaa shav postmortem ke liye bheja gaya he
 After the report of which the rape will be confirmed
 philhal mukadmaa darj kar police maamle kii chaanbin kar rahi he

 yah jaananaa dilachasp he ki chunaav saal main agar rigerv bank ne byaaj daron main katautee kii to us saal satta main rahane vaali party ko jeet mili he
 The Reserve Bank on Thursday cut the repo rate by a quarter of a percent in the first monetary policy review of this financial year
 yah madhyam varg ke liye badi raahat he kyonki makaan, vaahan or audyogic lone saste ho jaaenge
 In the year 2019, the Reserve Bank has cut interest rates twice
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle yah vitt varsh 2019-20 kii pehali samiksha baithak thi or ab chunaav hone tak isamen koi badlaav nahin hona he

 haalanki april kii samiksha kaa sabko intjaar rahata he, kyonki isse hi puure vitt varsh kaa ek tarah kaa rukh tay ho jaataa he
 By the way, the public does not benefit much from the slight reduction in the interest rates of the Reserve Bank, because the banks are hesitant to extend the benefit to the customers
 lekin pichley teen loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon par najar daalane to ek khaas tarah kaa trend najar aata he

 unhone cash rigerv reshyo yani siaraar main bhi koi badlaav nahin kiya
 That year, the Congress-led UPA government lost the election and a new government was formed under Narendra Modi
 2009 kaa natijasaal 2009 main loksabhaa chunaav 16 april se 13 may ke bich hua tha
 The first review of monetary policy was announced by the Reserve Bank on 21 April that year

 Subbarao cut the repo rate by 4% from 5% to 4%
 75 fisadi kar diya tha
 Similarly, the reverse repo rate was also cut by 3%
 25 fisadi kar diya gaya tha
 The UPA government came back to power again in the Lok Sabha elections that year

 paanch sitambar ko shikshak diwas ke maukey par desh bhar main gurujanon or shikshakon ko yaad kiya ja rahaa he
 Teachers are being honored in many places including Delhi, posts are being written on social media remembering their school and college teachers, many are also sharing their teacher's picture
 lekin in sabake bich kai log aise bhi hai jo is vishesh din kaa istemaal shikshakon kii badahaali par dhyaan khinchne ke liye kar rahe hai
 According to the news published in the Hindi newspaper Dainik Jagran, teachers have boycotted Teacher's Day in Uttarakhand's Almora demanding the implementation of a three-tier system
 vahiin bibisi kii report ke mutabik patna main kareeb chaar lakh niojit shikshak maheenon-maheenon se vetan na milane kii shikaayat ko lekar shikshak diwas ke din 'shikshak apmaan diwas' manaa rahe hai
 The English newspaper Indian Express has printed a letter to the President of a contract teacher in its editorial, in which the author has mentioned the circumstances under which a person who dreams of becoming a teacher becomes merely 'ad hoc'
 shikshak diwas ke utsavi maahaul main is tarah kii baaten yakeenan swaad bigaad sakati hai lekin ek din ke liye shikshakon or guruon kii maujuuda halaat se munh pher lene se bhi 
 However, on this day, Hindi satirist Harishankar Parsai wrote an essay titled 'teachers Refuse Honor'
 
 In this article, Parsai writes how on the occasion of September 5, different institutions and clubs etc
 find and honor retired teachers
 is niabandh ke ek sampadit hisse main vah likhte hai 'desh main paanch sitambar ko shikshakon ko sammanit karne kaa fishan chal padaa he
 If the President honors teachers, he also thinks that this program will be good
 akhabaaron main chhapega
 People will know that we know the glory of the Guru and also respect him
 aap samaj lijie ki agar daakuon kaa isi tarah shaan se aatmasamarpan hota rahaa or aisi hi garimapurna filmein banati raheen to aage chalakar daaku samraat maansingh kaa janmdiwas dasyu diwas ke rup main manaaya jayega
 Mansingh was no less qualified and respected than Radhakrishnan in his field
 phir ek 'milavati diwas' hoga, 'kalabazari diwas', 'taskari diwas', 'ghoosekhor diwas' hoga
 Teacher's Day is going on because Dr
 Radhakrishnan was the President
 agar vah sirf mahaan adhyaaapak maatr rahe hote to shikshak diwas nahin manaaya jaataa
 Comments shikshakon kii samasyaon par maano haath rakhte hue isi niabandh ke ek or hisse main parasaai likhte hai 'paanch sitambar shikshakon kaa apmaan diwas he
 Lies, hypocrisy
 garib adhyaaapak kaa uphaas he
 Is a farce
 vetan thik nahin denge
 We will not give good news
 sammaan karke ullu banaaenge
 Teachers of this country should refuse to be honored on 5 September
 log bulaaen to shikshak kah den hamen apana sammaan nahin karwaanaa
 If you force, we will report to the police
 ' Interestingly, this article, written long ago by Parsai, is very relevant in the present era
 desh ke vikaas main shikshakon se judi kai samasyaayein jyon kii tyon hai
 It can only be hoped that this essay written by Parsai will become irrelevant in the coming times, till then falsely 'happy Teachers' Day'
 
 
 hindi akhbaar dainik jaagran main chhapi khabar ke anusaar uttarakhand ke almoda main tristareey vyavastha lagu nahin hone kii maang ko lekar vahaan ke shikshakon ne shikshak diwas kaa bahishkaar kiya he
 At the same time, according to the BBC report, about four lakh employed teachers in Patna are celebrating Teacher's Day on Teachers' Day on the complaint of not getting salary for months
 angreji akhbaar indian express ne apane sampadakeey main ek sanvida shikshak kaa raashtrapati ke naam patr chapa he jisamen lekhak ne un halaat kaa zikr kiya he jiske tahat ek shikshak banane kaa sapana lekar chalaa vyakti mahaz 'aid hoque' banakar rah jaataa he
 In the festive atmosphere of Teacher's Day, such things can certainly spoil the taste, but even for one day, the teachers and gurus turn away from the current situation
 vaise isi din ke liye hindi ke diggaj vyangyakaar harishankar parasaai ne ek niabandh likhaa tha jiskaa sheershak tha 'shikshak sammaan se inkaar karen
 
 ' is lekh main parasaai likhte hai ki kis tarah 5 sitambar ke maukey par alag alag sansthaaen or club aadi ritred shikshakon ko dhund dhundhakar sammanit karte hai
 In an edited part of this essay, he writes, 'the fashion of honoring teachers has begun in the country on 5 September

 Then there will be an 'adulteration day', 'black marketing day', 'smuggling day', 'bribery day'

 The Kejriwal government has not proposed any kind of fund for women security force in the third budget for Delhi

 Also, mohalla guard teams have also been deployed in many areas under the Heapilot project
 ve is baat ko sweekaarte hai ki mahila suraksha force kaa maamla aage nahin bad paaya
 According to Sisodia, the case is related to law and order and police in Delhi
 dilli ke ecocendre shasit pradeshhone ke naate uske paas is tarah ke force gathan ke adhikaar nahin hai
 However, the government is also talking about negotiating with the police on this matter
 itnaa hi nahin sisitivi camere ke project ke liye bhi bajet menkoi prastaavnhin rakhaa gaya he
 At the same time, the budget of Delhi Women's Commission has been increased three times in this budget
 sisodiya ne zikr kiya ki sisitivi camere lagaae ja rahe hai
 Also, work is going on on the project
 lekin is puri bahes main sabase bada sawaal yah he ki kya mahila suraksha force banane par kejariwal sarkaar apane vaade se palat rahi he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious scheme National Health Protection Scheme i
e
 Ayushman Bharat was approved by the Union Cabinet on Wednesday evening
 is yojana kii ghoshnaa is saal ke aam bajet main vitt mantri arun jetali ne kii thi
 This scheme is also called Modicare
 cabinet ne neshnal health mishan ko jari rakhane par bhi sahmati di he
 The scheme will run till 31 March 2020 and the central government will spend Rs 85,217 crore for it
 cabinet kii baithak main sarogesi (regulation) bill main sanshodhano ko bhi manjuuri de di gai
 The bill has been introduced for the purpose of controlling surrogacy
 ayushmaan bharat kii baat karen to is yojana par nigaraanee rakhane ke liye ek athurity banane kaa prastaav bhi he
 The central government will bear 60 per cent of this scheme and the state government 40 per cent
 kya he ayushmaan bharat main khaas?is yojana ke tahat har parivaar ko 5 lakh rupee tak kaa health insurance milegaa
 There is no restriction on the number of family members
 is yojana ke tahat koun se parivaar aaenge, iskaa faisla aarthik aadhaar par hoga
 Families falling under this scheme will get treatment in government and selected private hospitals
 jo parivaar is yojana ke tahat aaenge unhen ilaaj kii suvidha desh bhar main kahin bhi mil sakegi
 What is Ayushman Bharat Scheme? Let us know that in the budget presented this year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had announced the world's largest health plan 'ayushman Bharat', that under this, medical cover of about 5 lakh rupees per year to about 10 crore families

 5 lakh health centers will be opened
 in swasthya kendron ke khole jane kaa phayda aam logon ko fori taur par hoga, kyonki unhen aam bimariyon ke ilaaj ke liye dur nahin janaa hoga or paas ke in kendron se ilaaj kara sakenge

 Until now there was a considerable distance from one health center to another health center in the country, but with the arrival of one and a half lakh new health centers, it would be accessible for sick people to get treatment close to home
 khaskar dur-daraaj or gramin anchalon main rahane vaale logon ke liye
 Their dependence on expensive private hospitals will be reduced
 nae collejon se aaenge nae doctorsone swasthya centre khulenge to doctoron kii jarurat bhi hogi
 In such a situation, the government has made a big plan to overcome the shortage of doctors in the country and for this, 24 district hospitals across the country will be upgraded and converted into medical colleges
 in medical collejon main ilaaj ke saath-saath nae doctors bhi taiyaar kiye jaaenge
 Today, there is a huge difference between doctor and patient in India and the ratio is 1: 1700, while according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 400 patients should have a doctor
 nai yojana ke tahat har 3 sansadeey kshetra yaa phir ek rajya main kam se kam ek medical college khole jaaenge
 At present, 67 thousand MBBS and 31 thousand post graduate doctors pass out from both private and government medical colleges in the country
 aise main kai nae medical college khulne se doctoron kii kami dur hogi or logon ke ilaaj ke liye paryaapt doctor sulabh ho sakenge

 baat 31 may kii he
 Rahul Gandhi along with his party colleagues was planning a tour of some states in eastern India
 usee dauraan unhen dhyaan aayaa ki kerala or assam main agle saal may tak chunaav hone hai
 These are states where Congress is in power
 unhone kamare main maujuud netaaon se kaha ki ve in do rajyon or anya jin rajyon main chunaav hone hai, unke liye ranneeti taiyaar karen
 It had been a month and a half since Rahul returned from his 56-day holiday on 16 April
 in chah hafton main rahul sansad ke andar or baahar narendra modi sarkaar ke sabase mukhar virdohi ke rup main ubhare
 Though he raised issues ranging from net neutrality to middle-class housing concerns and the rights of Dalits, the direction of his attacks has largely revolved around Modi's perceived neglect on farmers' concerns
 acshan se bharpoor in hafton main sarkaar ko gherne kii rahul kii koshishon main se kuch kaa ulataa asar bhi hua
 Like the issue of a food park in his own parliamentary constituency, Amethi
 lekin isse inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki dhire-dhire 'congress kii ore' se ek hawa jor pakadati gai he or congress netaa yah dekhakar josh main aa gaye hai ki party ne mukhya vipakshi dal kii bhoomika ko hasil kar liya he, vah haisiyat jise endie sarkaar ke shuruaati chah maheenon main usne trinmul congress jaisi partiyon ko saunp diya tha
 Randeep Singh Surjewala, in charge of the Communications Cell of the Congress, says, "today, only Rahul Gandhi is the challenger to Narendra Modi
 "party main is baat se koi inkaar nahin karata he
 But his question is that when Rahul prepares a strategy to reverse the electoral fortunes of the Congress, how soon will that moment come
 camel nath jaise party ke diggaj maanate hai ki philhal rahul apana homework kar rahe hai
 He says, "we will see some decisions in the coming months
 " lekin unke aalochak yah sab pehle bhi sun chuke hai
 As one general secretary of the party says, "the reshuffle in the Karnataka cabinet has been hanging for over a year, Rahul has been saying for six months that he needs to take some corrective action in Assam
" kerala main congress mukhyamantri or pradesh congress adhyaksh ke bich banty hui he
 There is no political action at the ground level
 "phir bhi ye netaa tak isse inkaar nahin karte hai ki tarotaaja rahul kii kahi baton or unki padayatraaon se party kii ore dhyaan aakarshith karne main madad mili he
 a two-tier strategy has been used to create this noise
 vaapasi ke baad se 45 dinon main kiye gaye saat rajyon ke daure main rahul ke jabaani hamalon or unki padayatraaon se congress kii ore media ne phir dhyaan dena shuru kar diya he, vahiin 20 sadasyeey soshal media team chupchaap unki bayaanbaji ko madad de rahi he
 As of May 19, the Congress Facebook page has outperformed the BJP in terms of engagement (see graphic)
 congress jahaan twitor par bijepi or modi ke vishaal foloar varg se bahut peechehai, vahiin utyub par (jisamen media brifing or vibhinn netaaon ke bhaashanon ke video niyamit rup se daale ja rahe hai) 25 may tak vah bijepi ke 2
 1 against 32 million viewers
 89 karod darshakon ke saath sattarudh dal ko kadi takkar de rahi he
 Deepender Hooda, the head of the party's social media team, says, "facebook's 'likes' and followers on Twitter can be fake or bought
 lekin utyub video kii angesement dar or video dekha janaa asli he
 "thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor, one of the earliest people to adopt Twitter and a celebrity on the medium, says the media and social media only reflect the ground realities
 kul milakar, sab kuch acha chal rahaa he
 There are some problems though this new style has failed to excite many people
 unhen lagata he ki congress netritv ne chunavi jameen dobaaraa hasil karne main na ke baraabar hi karrwai kii he
 Within a year from now, elections are to be held in six states — Bihar, Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry
 punjab main 2017 main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 But discontent among state units, lack of visible electoral arithmetic in terms of coalition formation and the high command and silence of Rahul on all matters of the state in particular, are the subject of general discussion among Congress supporters in these states
 masalan, bihar main party us janata parivaar ke saath gathbandhan karne kaa faisla kar chuki lagati he, jo swayan dagamagaati haalat main he
 However, a section of the state leadership has opposed it
 yahaan tak ki shuruyaat main rahul bhi aktubar kaa chunaav akele laduya chaahate the, lekin sutron kaa kahana he ki ve ab nitish kumaar or lalu prasad yadav ke saath haath milaane ke vichaar ke liye thode naram ho gaye hai
 The argument given is this: This is the price that the Congress must pay to stop Modi's chariot
 dilli main shikast ke baad bihar main jhatka nishchit rup se modi kii chamak khatm kar degaa or bhavishya main isse congress ko sabase zyada phayda hoga, jo sabase vyaavhaarik akhil bhartiya vikalp he
 The problem is that not everyone agrees
 kai log maanate hai ki congress bihar gathbandhan main kamjor bhagidaar bani rahegi or jaisaa ki ek loksabhaa saansad kehete hai, "argedy or jedy (you) kii chhatrachhaaya main khatm" ho jaaegi
 Sources believe that the possibility of the party returning to power in Assam again is very strong — where the BJP has lost its way after the rapid emergence due to land swap agreement with Bangladesh and the reversal of large dam projects

 iske baavjood, party ke varisht netaaon kaa aarope he ki sangharsh sulajhane ke liye party alaakaman ne koi prayaas nahin kiya he
 Former Union Minister Manish Tiwari says, "crowd mobilization and electoral mathematics both have different mechanisms
 donon aksar ek-duusare ke liye madadgaar nahin hote hai
 While political mobilization should be continued against the NDA, as far as electoral mathematics is concerned, the success of the efforts may be very different unless credible national and state level leaders are brought forward
 "thodaa-sa asantongin rajyon main chunaav hone hai, vahaan vishwasaneey netaaon kii kami bhi ek samasya he, jise in rajyon ke netaa bhi sweekaar karte hai

" aise main agar alaakaman mukhyamantri tarun gogoi ke khilaaf satta virdohi bhaavana ko khatm kar de or andruni kalah se nibat le, to congress aasaani se vaapasi kar sakati he

 Although Chandy has repeatedly complained to both Sonia and Rahul against Sudheeran, it is believed that Rahul is firmly supporting his state president
 punjab main bhi kahani alag nahin he, bhale hi baagi bane purv mukhyamantri amarinder singh der se sulah ke sanket de rahe hai
 It is unlikely that Rahul will sack state party president Pratap Singh Bajwa and accept Amarinder's demand to be given the charge

" philhal, bataaya jaataa he ki rahul party ke sanghathanaatmak chunaavon ke july tak puraa hone kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 His colleagues say that by then, Rahul will have completed his tour of 15 states and would have guessed the broader picture for the party
 agar sutron par yakeen karen to yah rajya str ke nirnay se pehle dilli main sheersh str par bada faisla hoga
 There is a buzz in the Congress that Rahul himself wants to adopt the electoral path to take the top position in the party
 agar yah sach he, to yah agle maah ke ant tak ho jane kii sambhaavna he—or yah pichley 50 saal main party main sabase sahaj satta hastantaran hone kii sambhaavna he, kyonki unke virodh main koi ummidaar hone kii sambhaavna nahin he

 Input - RJ Alok dilli mahila ayog ne placement ke naam par dhokhadhadi karne vaali ek company ke changul se 3 maasoom bacchiyon ko chhudaaya he

 lekin 6 pariwaron se mili shikaayat se pataa chalaa ki ladakiyon ko kamaron me kaid karke rakhaa gaya or or unke saath marpet bhi kii gai he
 In an exclusive conversation with 'aaj Tak', the Chairman of the Commission, Swati Maliwal said that the family called the Delhi Women's Commission on 181 and informed that their sons and daughters had been picked up from Jharkhand by raising a placement company
 3 saal tak placement company ne bacchon kii baatcheet jharkhand main rah rahe parivaar se nahin hone di
 According to Swati Maliwal, following the complaint, the Delhi Commission for Women laid a trap under which the human smuggler was summoned to Akshardham and nabbed and handed over to the police
 haalanki is dhandhe ko chalaane vaali ek mahila giraftaar kar lee gai he lekin uskaa betaa pakad se baahar he
 Currently 3 girls have been released from captivity but 3 girls are still missing
 aage swati maliwal bataati hai ki ladakiyon kii umr behad kam he isliye unki child welfare kamity main peshi ho rahi he
 Surprisingly, the human trafficker has openly threatened the house of these family members
 us shaks ne dhamkee dete hue kaha he ki parivaar ke logon kaa balaatkaar or murder kar duungaa
 The Delhi Commission for Women says that they are issuing notices to the DCP in the entire matter
 isame police se sawaal puch rahe hai ki maanav taskar ko ab tak giraftaar kyon nahi kiya gaya? saath hi ayog se police maang kar rahi he ki exiaar main tamaam dharaaen jodakar maanav taskar kar rahe us shaks kaa naam bhi shaamil kiya jaae, or jharkhand ke is parivaar ko suraksha di jaae
 The commission's Chief Swati Maliwal, in a conversation with Aaj Tak, claimed that there are many placement companies in Delhi which are running indiscriminately without any rules
 yah companiyaan duusare rajyon se 8, 9, 12 or 13 saal kii ladakiyon ko dilli main laakar kaam karvaa rahe hai
 The situation is that these children are not being allowed to talk to their family
 bacchon ko kis tarah pratadit kiya jaataa he, is maamle kii jaanch chal rahi he
 The aggrieved father also expressed his pain that his family was poor, so he had sent his daughter to the city to earn money
 lekin peedit pita ke mutabik 3 saal se na to selary mil rahi he or na hi ladki se baat ho paa rahi he
 The father says that his family is being threatened that if he takes the girl to Jharkhand, he will kill her
 peedit parivaar kii ek mahila ne bataaya ki placement company paise kii laalchee he
 People of the company refused to ask for the children's salary
 na phone number diya jaataa tha or naahi phone par baatcheet karai jaati he
 Three times the family members came to meet the girls but they were not given money, so they had to return to Jharkhand by train without tickets
 mahila ne aage bataaya ki vah apni ankhon se dekh chuki hai ki jo ladki kaam nahi karti use kamare main band karke, tivi kii aawaaj tej karke bahut peeta jaataa he
 The woman from the victim's family made a surprise reveal
 mahila ne bataaya ki ek ladki jharkhand se ai thi uski achaanak tabiyat kharaab hui or pair main sujan aa gai thi
 When the girl's condition became critical, she was taken to a hospital to get her treated
 phir ek din uske parivaar ko phone karke kah diya gaya ki ladki kisi ladke ke saath bhaag gai or baad main ladki kii laash mili thi
 The woman alleges that she is being threatened that if seen in Delhi, she will rape and murder
 dilli mahila ayog sarkaar se maang karegaa kii placement companiyon ke liye sakht kanoon banaae jaaen or jo companiyaan galat kaam kar rahi hai un par kadi karrwai ho
 At the same time, the Commission is also demanding action against those who keep these children in their cells and misbehave with them
