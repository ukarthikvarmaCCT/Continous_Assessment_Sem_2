 is prakaar kii dharti main maujuud pani aksar mitti ke saath milakar use itani sakhti se jamaa detaa he ki mitti bhi cement yaa pathar jaisi kathor ho jaati he
 Places with permafrost are mostly near the poles of the earth, although some high mountain areas are also where permafrost is found
 parmafrost main khudaai karnaa pathar todane kii tarah hota he or iske liye aksar baari auzaaron kii zaroorat hoti he
 Buildings in permafrost areas are very difficult to erect because the heat of these buildings melts over time and weakens the foundation of the building
 is kaaran se yaa to imaarat ke neeche gahare khambe gaadkar use sthir karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he yah phir neeche ke parmafrost ko imaarat kii garmi se bachaane kii zaroorat hoti he

 Gandhiji has described this clever scheme of Macaulay in many of his articles and called this declaration "mischievous"
 yah satya he ki gandhi ji swayan angreji ke prabhavi gyaata tathaa vaktaa the
 Once an English scholar had said that only one and a half people in India know English - one Gandhiji and half Mr
 Jinnah at: bhashaa ke sambandh main gandhi ji ke vichaar raajnneetik athwa bhavuk na hokar atyant santulit tathaa gambhir hai
 Gandhiji's views were clear in the context of the medium of education
 ve angreji bhashaa ko ladane ko vidhyaarthee samaaj ke prati "kapatpurna kriti" samajhate the
 He believed that 90 percent of the people in India study only till the age of fourteen, so the mother tongue should have maximum knowledge
 unhone 1909 i
 main "swarajya" main apane vichaar prakat kiye hai
 According to him, teaching thousands of people English is to enslave them
 gandhi ji videshi madhyam ke katu virdohi the
 He believed that foreign media encourages the tendency of children to put unnecessary pressure, rote and mimic and create a lack of originality in them
 yah desh ke bacchon ko apane hi ghar main videshi bana detaa he
 His statement was that- gandhi ji ke anusaar videshi madhyam kaa rog bina kisi deree ke turant roak dena chahie
 He was of the opinion that no other language can replace the mother tongue
 unke anusaar, "gaay kaa doodh bhi maa kaa doodh nahin ho saktaa
 " gandhiji desh kii ekta ke liye yah aavashyak maanate the ki angreji kaa prabhutv sheeghra samaapt hona chahie
 They considered the logic of unity of the country using English as inane
 sachhee baat to yahi he ki bharat vibhaajan kaa kaary angreji padhe-likhe logon kii hi dein he
 Gandhiji said- "this problem should have been solved in 1938 AD, or it must have been in 1947 AD
 " gandhi ji ne na keval madhyam ke rup main angreji bhashaa kaa mukhar virodh kiya balki rashtrabhasha ke prashn par bhi rashtriya ekta tathaa akhandta ko prakat karne vaale vichaar prakat kiye
 He said, bhagwat puraana hinduon ke attharah puraanon main se ek he
 It is also called Shrimad Bhagavatam or simply Bhagavatam
 iskaa mukhya varnya vishay bhakthi yoga he, jisamen krishna ko sabhi devon kaa dev yaa swayan bhagwaan ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, devotion to Ras Bhava has also been represented in this Purana
 paramparaagat taur par is puraana kaa rachayita veda vyas ko mana jaataa he
 Shrimad Bhagwat is the crown jewel of Indian poetry
 bhagwaan shukdev dwaara maharaj parakshit ko sunaaya gaya bhaktimaarg to maano sopan hi he
 There is fragrance of Shri Krishna-love in each of its verses
 isamen saadhan-gyaan, siddhagyan, saadhan-bhakthi, siddha-bhakthi, maryaada-maarg, anugrah-maarg, dwait, advait samanvay ke saath preranadai vividh upakhyanon kaa adbhut sangrah he
 In the Ashtadash Puranas, Bhagwat is very important and famous Purana
 puraanon kii gananaa main bhagwat ashtum puraana ke rup main parigrihit kiya jaataa he 
 In the Bhagavata Purana, Maharishi Sut Goswami narrates a story to the sadhus presented to him
 sadhu log unase vishnu ke vibhinn avtaron ke bare main prashn poochhate hai
 Sut Goswami says that he had heard this story from another sage Shukdev
 isamen kul baarah sakandh hai
 All incarnations are described in summary form in the first episode
 aajkal 'bhagwat' akhya dhaaran karanevaale do puraana uplabdh hote hai : Therefore, in both these, whose calculation is required in the Purani category? a solution to this question is necessary
 vividh prakaar se samiksha karne par antat: yahi prathit hota he ki shrimadbhagwat ko hi puraana maananaa chahie tathaa devibhagwat ko uppurana kii koti main rakhana uchit he
 There is silence about the form of Shrimad Bhagwat Devi Bhagwat
 parantu devibhagwat 'bhagwat' kii gananaa uppuraanon ke antargat karata he tathaa apane aapako puraanon ke antargat
 The Bhuvanakosh mentioned in the Devi Bhagpanpancham wing literally follows the subject presented in the fifth wing of Srimad Bhagwat
 shribhagwat main bharatvarsh kii mahima ke pratipadak aathon shloke devi bhagwat main aksharsh: usee kram main uddhrut hai 
 The difference in the descriptions of the two is so much that where the Srimad Bhagavat takes a natural medium of prose for the sake of the description of the subject, Devi Bhagwat uses the artificial medium of the verse to demonstrate the uniqueness
 shrimadbhagwat bhakthiras tathaa aadhyatmagyaan kaa samanvay upasthit karata he
 The Bhagavata is considered to be the self-sufficiency of Nigamakalpataru, which has been made amritamay by the natural brahmachari and the great scientist Maharishi Shuk, combined with his melodious speech
 swayan bhagwat main kaha gaya he- 'vidyavatam Bhagwate Examination': Bhagwat is the test of scholarship and for this reason it is also incomparable in terms of commentary
 vibhinn vaishnav sampradaay ke vidwaanon ne apane vishisht mat kii upapatti tathaa paripushti ke nimitt bhagwat ke upar swasiddhantanuai vyakhyaaon kaa pranayan kiya he jinamein kuch tikaakaron kaa yahan sankshipt sanket kiya ja rahaa he: The exact decision of Bhagwat's country has not yet been made
 ekadash skandh main kaveri, tamraparni, kritamala aadi dravidadeshiy nadiyon ke jal pinevaale vyaktiyon ko bhagavan vasudev kaa amalashay bhakt batalaaya gaya he
 It is considered by scholars to be a clear indication of the Alavar of the Tamil country
 bhagwat main dakshin desh ke vaishnav tirthon, nadiyon tathaa parvaton ke vishisht sanket hone se katipay vidvan tamildesh ko iske udai kaa sthaan maanate hai
 There is a substantial difference in the subject of time also
 itnaa nishchit he ki bopadev, mahadev tathaa raja ramchandra ke karnadhipati tathaa mantri, prakhyat dharamshastri hemaadri ne apane 'chaturvarg chintamani' main bhagwat ke anek vachan udhrut kiye hai, bhagwat ke rachayita nahin maane ja sakate
 Shankaracharya's grandfather Guru Gaudapadacharya has quoted two verses of Bhagavat in his 'panchakaranavyakhya', 'jagruhe Paurusam Rupam' and 'shrey: Srutiin Bhakti Mudasya te Vibho' in 'uttaragita Tika'
 isse bhagwat kii rachana saptam shatee se arvachin nahin maani ja sakati
 The following table gives the composition of Bhagavata Purana suggested by some scholars- bhagwat kaa prabhaav madhyayugiya vaishnav sampradaayon ke udai main nitant kriyasheel tha tathaa bharat kii prantiy bhashaaon ke krishna kaavyon ke utthan main vishesh mahatvashaalee tha
 Ashtaghapi, Nimbarki, Radhavallabhi poets of Braj Bhasha took radiance and inspiration from Bhagwat, singing Radha Krishna's leelas in Brajbhasha
 mithila ke vidyapati, bengal ke chandidas, gyaandas tathaa govinddas, assam ke shankardev tathaa madhavdev, utkal ke upendra bhanj tathaa dinkrishnadas, maharashtra ke namdev tathaa madhav pandit, gujarat ke narsi mehta tathaa rajasthan kii mirabai - in sabhi santon tathaa kaviyon ne bhagwat ke rasmay varnan se prerana praapt kar radhakrishna kii kamaneey keli kaa gayan apane vibhinn kaavyon main kiya he
 The influence of Bhagwat on the Vaishnava poets of Tamil, Andhra, Kannada and Malayalam is also less
 bhagwat kaa aadhyatmik drushtikon advaitvaad kaa he tathaa sadhanadrushti bhakthi kii he
 Thus the symmetry of devotion with Advaita is Bhagavata's own peculiarity
 inhen kaarnon se bhagwat valmikiy ramayana tathaa mahabharat ke saath sanskrit kii 'upjivy' kavyatrayee ke antarbhoot mana jaataa he
 Bhagwat has 18 thousand verses, 335 chapters and 12 wings
 iske vibhinn skandhon main vishnu ke leelavataron kaa varnan badi sukumaar bhashaa main kiya gaya he
 But the tenth Skandha is the heart of Bhagwat, giving a detailed account of the fine pastimes of Lord Krishna
 anya puraanon main, jaise vishnupurana, brahmavaivart aadi main bhi krishna kaa charit nibaddh he, parantu dasham skandh main lilapurushottam kaa charit jitani madhur bhashaa, komal padvinyas tathaa bhakthiras se aplut hokar varnit he vah adwitiya he
 Raspanchadhyayi spirituality and literature is a unique object in poetry from a different perspective
 venugit, gopigit,, yugalageet, bhramaragit ne bhagwat ko kavy ke udaatt str par pahunchaa diya he
 Following are the 12 skandas of Bhagwat - bhagwat puraana kaa ek prishth Childhood of lord krishna phuligunth agethi, bhanoli tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke almoda jile kaa ek gaanv he

 The Artesian aquifer is a confined aquifer with underground water whose water flows upstream through a well without being pumped; Such wells are called Artesian wells
 prakritik dabaav kii maatra uchit hone par pani jameen kii sataha tak bhi pahunch saktaa he, aisi sthiti main is kuen ko bahata hua artysian kuan kaha jaataa he
 Aqueous is a layer of soft rock like limestone or sandstone, which absorbs water through the inward passage

 This keeps the pressure high, so when the water finds a way, it overcomes the force of gravity and instead of going down it starts to climb

 Fossil aquifers can also be Artesian if the pressure of the surrounding rocks is high enough

 The Artesian wells are named after Artois, the former province of France, where many Artesian wells were excavated by Carthusian monks from 1126 onwards
 aasapaas artysian kuon kii maujuudagi ke kaaran sanyukt rajya america ke kuch shaharon ko artesia naam se bulaayaa jaataa tha
 Other places with Artesian wells include: kai varshon tak olympia bear artysian kuen se praapt pani se hi banati thi
 The use of water obtained from Artesian was heavily used by the company in its promotion as well
 haalanki vigyapanon main ye kabhi nahin bataaya gaya ki artysian kaa pani kya hota he, hameshaa ye daawa kiya jaataa rahaa ki yah pani artysian kii puranic aabaadi dwaara niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 Once this liquor company was acquired by another large company, the use of Artesian water was stopped and so was the advertising campaign

 If people in a restaurant complain of getting food too late, its managers can form an informal theoretical paradigm, using the concepts of waiters, guests, cooks and tables
 iske baad prabandhak likh sakate hai ki kisi mez par kis samay logon ko bethaaya gaya, kis samay unase waiter dwaara khaane kaa aadesh liye gaye, kis samay yah order waiter dwaara rasoi tak pahunchaae gaye, kis samay khaanaa taiyaar hua or kis samay mehmaanon ko parosa gaya

 a closed watershed or inclusive watershed is a geography called a watershed area in which rain or melting ice water collects and stops at a lake, marshy area or dry area instead of flowing into the sea or ocean through a river
 aam taur par jo bhi pani dharti par barish yaa himpat ke kaaran padataa he wo nadiyon, nehron or jharanon ke dwaara oonche ilaakon se nichle ilaakon kii ore bahata he
 These moving groups of water keep converging with each other until a single big river is formed
 phir yah nadi aage chalakar kisi sagar main mil jaati he
 But in areas which are isolated from the seas due to slopes, mountains or deserts, the water stops at the lowest place
 aise sthanon par yaa to jhilein ban jaati hai yaa dharti pani ko sokh leti he
 Some of the largest lakes in the world have some lakes formed due to such closed watersheds, such as the Aral Sea and the Caspian Sea
 angrezi main band jalsambar ko "endorheik basin" kaha jaataa he
 Geographically it is seen that the closed watershed areas are often also desert areas
 aisa isliye he ke agar pani ek hi sthaan par ikkatha hone se uski maatra badhati hi jaae to antat pani apane or samudr ke bich kii rukawat ko parajeet kar hi detaa he
 Scientists speculate that at some time Krishna Sagar was such a closed watershed lake which broke its boundaries due to rising water and got into the Mediterranean Sea
 khule jalsambharon main jo namak or anya padaarth milte rahete hai ve aage chalakar sagar main bah jate hai
 This does not happen in closed watersheds
 pani main mili namak or anya padaarth in jhiilon yaa shushk kshetron main jaakar jamaa hoten rahete hai
 Hence the closed Jalasambhar lakes become very saline over time
 bharat ke rajasthan rajya main ajmer ke paas sthit sambar jhil thik aise hi band jalsambar kii ek khaari jhil he
 Pollution on such lakes also has a very bad effect because the pollutants continue to collect and grow instead of dispersing into the sea
 apni bhinn bhugolic or mausami paristhitiyon ke kaaran alag mahadwipon main band jalsambharon kii sankhya bhi bhinn he
 About 21% of Australia's area is closed watersheds, while in North America, closed watersheds cover only 5% of the area
 puure vishwa kaa lagbhag 18% jamini kshetrafal band jalsanbharon se grast he
 Closed watersheds with the largest area of the world are found in the interior of Asia
 kuch sookhe kshetron main band jalsambar kaa pani namak or anya lavan to le aata he, lekin garmi or shushkta ke kaaran tezi se vashpit hota rahata he
 At some places, the water flows only in one season or after flowing for some yoga, the geographical conditions change and stop coming
 aise shushk jhil vaale ilaaqon main namak kii moti or sakht parat jamkar ek vistrut samtal maidan bana detii he jo milon-koson tak failaa hota he
 Because such salt fields are perfectly flat and very large, they are used by fast trains to set a speed record
 kabhi-kabhi band jalsambharon kii jhiilon kaa aakaar mausam ke saath badalte pani ke bahaav ke saath-saath badalata rahata he
 These lakes shrink during the dry season and increase due to rains or snowfall
 kabhi-kabhi jab pani kam hota he to ek jhil kai choti jhiilon main bat jaati he or phir barishon ke baad pani badhane par milakar phir ek badi jhil ban jaati he
 If economic growth in an area is accompanied by water-resistant dams or canals for irrigation that reduce the flow of water into closed watershed lakes, these lakes often shrink and become very small
 aisi sthiti main un aabaadiyon par bahut karaab asar padataa he jo apane vyavsaay yaa jivan ke liye in jhiilon par nirbhar hon
 Something similar has happened with the Aral Sea in Central Asia

 Despite Neo's refusal, Trinity returns to the Matrix and ruins the backup plant

 Inside, Neo meets a program architect who is the creator of the Matrix

 The treaty had public and secret terms, which are as follows: saarvajanik sharten: Secret Terms: pashchim europe kshetra main europe mahadweep ke pashchimi raashtra aate hai
 According to another definition prevailing during the Cold War which lasted from 1945-1991, the region of nations affiliated with the West European Union was called West Europe, which is now part of the European Union
 pashchimi europea sangh 1948 ke samay asamyavaadee europea rashtron dwaara sangathit ek surakshatmak sanghathan tha or ye eastern block yaa warsaw sandhi ke viruddh sangathit hua tha
 Western European nations are high-income developed nations, most of which are governed by a democratic government and are also members of NATO and the European Union with a mixed economy

 Most of the nations under "western Europe" in the Cold War period are as follows
 
 According to the 2011 edition of the United Nations Statistics Department publication, the following nine nations are counted in Western Europe, except for the United Nations Regional Group, according to which the term includes North and Southern Europe: katihaar, bihar kaa ek upavibhak

 They also work in vista sensor ek aisa upkaran he jo kisi bhautik raashi ko maapne kaa kaary karata he tathaa ise ek aise sanket main parivartit kar detaa he jise kisi paryvekshak yaa yantra dwaara padhaa ja saktaa he
 For example, a mercury-filled glass thermometer converts the measured temperature to the expansion and contraction of a fluid that can be read on a calibrated glass tube
 ek thermokapal taapmaana ko ek output voltage main parivartit kar detaa he jise ek voltmetre dwaara padhaa ja saktaa he
 In terms of accuracy, all sensors need to be calibrated to known standards
 sensoron kaa upyog rosemara kii vastuon main kiya jaataa he
 Such as - touch-sensitive lift buttons and lamps whose touch to the ground floor makes it dim or fast
 in sensoron ke or bhi anginat anuprayog hai jiske bare main adhikansh log abhi tak parichit nahin hai
 These applications include carts, machines, space technology, medicine, manufacturing and robotics
 ek sensor kii samvedansheeltaa yah suchit karti he ki maapit raashi ke badalane par sensor kaa output kitni baar badalata he
 For example, if the mercury of a thermometer is 1 cm liquefied as a result of a change of 1 ° c in temperature, its sensitivity is 1 cm / ° C
 jo sensor bahut chote parivartanon ko maapte hai, unamem bahut ucch koti kii samvedansheeltaa honi chahie
 The sensors also impact the way they measure; For example, a thermometer used to measure room temperature is cooled by pouring it into a cup filled with a hot fluid while the thermometer is heated by that fluid
 sensoron kii banaavat aisi honi chahie ki un par kam prabhaav pade jis par maapne kaa kaary kiya jaataa he
 This often improves with the shortening of the sensor and other benefits can also come from it
 praudyogic pragati MEMS praudyogiki prayukt microcenseron ke rup main sookshmdarsheey str par adhik se adhik sensoron ke utpaadan ko niyat karata he
 In most cases, a microsensor reaches significantly higher speeds and sensitivity than elliptical approaches
 ek acha sensor nimnlikhit niyamon kaa anusaran karata he: The design of ideal sensors is linear
 aise kisi sensor kaa output sanket maapit gundharm visheshta ke maan ke raikhik rup se samaanupatik hota he
 The sensitivity is then defined as the ratio of the output signal and the measured property characteristic
 udhaahranswaroop, yadi ek sensor taapmaana maapne kaa kaary karata he or iskaa ek voltage output he to samvedansheeltaa ek sthiraank hoti he jisaki ikai he; yah sensor raikhik hota he kyonki sabhi maapan binduon par anupaat sthir hota he
 If the sensor is not ideal then several types of interference can be seen: in sabhi vyutkramon ko paddatibaddh trutiyon yaa kramarahit trutiyon ke rup main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 Methodological errors can sometimes be compensated through some type of calibration policy
 shor ek kramarahit truti he, jaise nispandan, jise sanket prakriya dwaara saadharantaya sensor ke gatyaatmak gatividhi kii keemat par kam kiya ja saktaa he
 The resolution of a sensor is the smallest change that it detects in the amount being measured
 praayah kisi ankiy pradarshan main sabase kam mahatvapurn ank main utaar-chadhaav hoga jo yah suchit karata he ki keval us pariman ke parivartan main hi vibhedan hua he
 Differentiation is related to the accuracy with which measurement is performed
 udhaahranswaroop, ek scanning tanneling jaanch parmaanuon or anuon main vibhedan kar saktaa he
 Biological sensors are found in all living organisms whose implementation is similar to the mechanical devices described
 inamen se adhikansh aisi vishisht koshikaayen hai jo nimna ke prati samvedansheel hai: Artificial sensors that mimic biological sensors using biological sensitive components are called biosensors

 ham jaanate hai ki pratidin nagar evam shaharon se vyarth-jal kii ek bahut badi maatr janit hoti he
 The major component of this waste water is the excreta of man
 nagar ke is vyarth jal ko wahiwamal bhi kehete hai
 It contains large amounts of organic matter and microorganisms which are mostly pathogenic
 wahiwamal kii badi maatr athwa shahari vyarthjal kaa rojaanaa niptaan kaise kiya jaay? ise prakritik jal sroton jaise nadi, jharne main sidhe visarjeet nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Before immersion, sewage is treated in the sewage plant so that it becomes pollution free
 sookshmjeev pratidin vishvabhar main vyarth jal ke lakhon-karodon galen pani ke upachaar main mahatvapurn bhoomika-nibhaate hai
 This system has been used in almost all parts of the world for centuries
 aaj ke din tak koi bhi manushya dwaara taiyaar kii gai praudyogiki wahit mel ke sookshmjivi upachaar ke saamne nahin tik pai
 Due to increasing urbanization, a much larger quantity of sewage is generated than before, hence the number of these treatment plants has not been increased enough to treat such a large quantity of sewage
 isliye apchaarit wahiwamal ko sidhe hi nadiyon main chhod diya jaataa he
 As a result, the number of pollution and water borne diseases is increasing
 vyarth jal kaa upachaar parposhit sookshmjeev se kiya jaataa he jo wahit mel main prakritik rup se vaas karte hai
 This treatment is performed in the following two stages- praathmik upachaar - upachaar ke is charan main wahit mel se bade-chote kanon ko nisyandan tathaa avsaadan dwaara bhautik rup se alag kar diya jaataa hai
 They are separated into different stages
 aarambh main tairte hue kooday-karkat ko anukramik nisyandan dwaara hataa diya jaataa he
 The chitabalukasham is then expelled by sedimentation

 This results in strong vigorous growth of beneficial airborne microorganisms in the form of energy
 vruddhi ke dauraan yah sookshmjeev bahirisrav main upasthit carbonic padaarthon ke pramukh bhaagon kii khapat karata he
 This significantly reduces the BOD of the effusion
 bi o di oxigen kii us maatr ko sanderbhit karata he jo jeevanu dwaara ek litre pani main upasthit carbonic padaarthon kii khapat kar unhen oxikrut kar den
 Sewage is treated until the BOD is reduced
 jal ke ek namoonay main sookshmjiviyon dwaara oxigen ke udgrahan kii dar kaa maapan bi o di pareekshan se kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, the measurement of organic matter present indirectly in water is BOD
 jab vyarth-jal kaa bi o di adhik hoga, tab isaki pradooshan kshamta bhi adhik hogi
 Once the BOD of sewage or waste water is reduced to a sufficient amount, the effluent is sent to the effluent tank where the bacterial herds convert it into sediment
 yah avsaad sakriyit aapank kehalaata he
 The active pumps the small part of the exhaust back into the aeration tank

 This mixture of gases is called biogas
 chunki yah gas jvalansheel hoti hai, is kaaran inkaa prayog urja ke strot ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 The effluent from the secondary treatment plant is usually released into natural sources of water such as rivers, springs
 biogas kai gaison kaa mishran he tathaa sookshmjivi sakriyata dwaara utpann hoti he
 We know that during growth and metabolism, microorganisms produce various types of gaseous products
 jo gas utpann hoti he, vah in sookshmjiviyon dwaara khapat kiye gaye carbonic padaarthon par nirbhar karti he
 CO2 gas is mainly produced in the fermentation of wet flour, cheese manufacturing and production of beverages
 yadhyapi kuch bacteria jo sailulogy padaarthon par avayuviya rup se ugte hai vah CO2 tathaa H2 ke saath-saath badi maatr main methane bhi utpann karte hai
 These bacteria are collectively called methanogens

 The epic text of this epic is Valmikkrit Ramayana
 mahakavy main chaar kand hai
 From the point of view of the story of the story, this epic is divided into 22 circles and is coordinated with the overall characteristics of the epic
 rachana kaa mukhya uddeshy vyakaran evam sahitya ke lakshanon ko lakshya dwaara upasthit karne kaa he
 This epic is divided into four kandas in order to present the symptoms by the target, in which three kandas serve the purpose of the author by using various word forms according to Sanskrit grammar
 madhya main ek cond kavyasaushthav ke katipay angon ko abhilakshith kar rachaa gaya he
 The sequence of composition is such that the first case grammatically stores a wide variety of word forms
 dwitiya cond 'adhikaar cond' he jisamen panineey vyakaran ke katipay vishisht adhikaron main pradarshit niyamon ke anusaar shabdaprayog he
 The third episode has been designed with a view to reflecting literary characteristics, hence Mahakavi has termed this incident as 'prasad Kand'
 is cond main chaar adhikaran hai : pratham adhikaran main shabdalankar evam arthalankar ke lakshya hai
 In the second tribunal, the nature of the virtue has been demonstrated by the target, in the third tribunal, while displaying the nature of emotionality, highlights various elements and measures of politics according to the theme of the plot
 prasann cond kaa chauthaa adhikaran is mahakavy kaa ek vishesh rup he
 It contains such verses that have parallel incorporation of Sanskrit and Prakrit language, the same verse is sub-stitched in Sanskrit, whose verse is also the same form of Prakrit verse and both languages have the same prophetic meaning
 bhashaa sam kaa udhaaharan prastut karata hua yah ansh bhattikavy kii nijee visheshta he
 The last episode again demonstrates the varied word form of the trinity, a complex form of Sanskrit grammar
 yah cond sabase bada he
 Symptomatic, in terms of the division of the Kathaavastu in these four scandals, the first five cantos are described in which the undertaking of Ramjanma, Sita Vivaha, Rama's Vanagman and Sitaharan and Rama's seeding are described respectively

 Thirdly, there are the next four cantos in Prasannakand which include the performance of Sita's cognition, the description of Prabhat in Lanka, the story of Vibhishana's arrival with Rama and the story of the bridge
 antim, tisaint cond agle nau sarg le letaa he jinamein sharbandh se lagaakar raja ramchandra ke ayodhya laut aane tak kaa kathabhag varnit he
 There are 1625 verses in four episodes and 22 sergoes, of which the first verse Mangalacharan is objective and the last verse is of poetry
 1625 padyasankhya ke is mahakavy main adhikansh prayog anushtubh shlokon kaa he jinamein sarg chah, nau tathaa 14 vaan evam 12 vaan

 katipay sameekshak kavi kaa puraa naam bhartruhari maanate hai, parantu yah bhartruhari nishchit hi shatakatray ke nirmaataa athwa vaakyapadiya ke praneta bhartruhari se bhinn hai
 The Bhatti surname is related to Bhartrihari poet Valbhiranesh Sridhar Sen
 mahakavi bhatti kaa samay isvi chhathi shatabdi kaa uttarardh sarvasammat he
 The examples indicated in the Alankara class show that Bhatti and Bhamah are followers of the same tradition
 bhattikavy kii rachana ke purv lagbhag 10 shatabdiyon tak panini kaa ashtaadhi kaa hi gahan pathan-pathan hota aa rahaa tha
 Bhatti's aim was to create a tool that would make Ashtadhyayi's study easier
 aisa unhone pehle se maujuud vyakaran ke bhashyagranthon main die gayi udaahranon ko ramakatha ke saath sambaddh karke kiya
 This led to simplicity and simplicity in learning

 Cargo is usually called transporting goods or products by ship, aircraft, train, van, or truck for commercial gain
 aadhunik samay main, parivahan ke liye bahut lambey-maal dhone vaale intermodal container kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Various types of sea cargo are handled at the port terminals
 hawaii cargo, saamanytah air fret ke naam se janaa jaataa he, yah maal vitaran karne waalon se companiyon dwaara ekatra kiya jaataa he or graahakon ko diya jaataa he
 In 1911 the aircraft first started to be used as mail cargo
 antat nirmaataaon nen anya prakaar ke maal ke liye vimaan kii digining shuru kar di
 There are several large commercial aircraft such as the Boeing 747 and N124 for carrying cargo, with the intention that it can be easily converted into cargo aircraft
 aise vishaal vimaan main tej-loding kii suvidha hoti he jise unit lod divaces kehete hai, yah bahut kuch contenrikrut cargo jahaaj kii tarah hota he
 ulds are in the front of the aircraft
 adhikansh deshon ke paas airlift rasad seva ke liye kai cargo vimaan jaise kii si-17 globamaster III badi sankhya main hai jiskaa upyog ve apni jaruraton ke liye karte hai
 Trains are capable of transporting containers brought by large numbers of ships
 ispaat, lakdi or koyale ke parivahan ke liye trainon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Because they carry a huge amount of material and usually reach the destination directly
 sahi paristhitiyon main, sadak kii tulana main rail dwaara maal parivahan main arth or urja donon kii adhik bachat hoti he, khaskar jab thok maatra main yaa lambii duuri ke liye parivahan kiya ja rahaa ho
 The major disadvantage in rail freight transport is lack of flexibility
 isi kaaran, rail parivahan ne apana kaaphi vyapaar sadak parivahan ke haathon ganvaan diya
 Rail freight is often based on the cost of loading, as it is transferred from one transport to another
 contanikaran paddatiyon ko lakshya kar isaki laagat ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Many governments are currently encouraging consignees to use the train because of the environmental benefits
 parceforce yaa fedex jaisi kai companiyaan, sabhi prakaar ke maal kaa parivahan sadak dwaara karti hai
 Everything from letters to cargo containers at home, these companies deliver very fast, sometimes in a single day
 sadak parivahan kaa shreshth udhaaharan he khaadya padaarth, jaisaa ki supermarketon ko prati din maal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he taaki unki taakon par saamaan bharaa rahe
 Retailers rely on all types of delivery trucks, whether they are large, semi trucks or small delivery vans
 parivahan karne se pehle aamtaur par bhaade ko vibhinn shreniyon main ladaan ke anusaar suniyojit kar liya jaataa he
 The range of an object is determined by: aam taur par parivahan kii vastuon ko gharelu saamaan, express parcel or fret ladaan ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he: Less than truckloads are the first category of cargo freight shipments — representing most of its and most business-to-business shipments
 el tii el shipment ko aksar motor fret bhi kehete hai kyonki isamen adhiktar parivahan kaa kaam motaron vaahakon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Most LTL shipments range from 50 to 7,000 kg to 2

 el tii el ke prayek bhaade kaa ausat 600 kigram or bakse kaa aakaar maanak he
 Long cargo and / or large cargo are subject to extreme length and cubic capacity surcharges
 el tii el main prayukt trailor kii shrenee 28 se 53 feet se ho sakati he
 The freight standard in the city is usually 48 feet
 adhiktar tang or awasaiya vaataavaran main 28 feet trailor kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Typically for a mixed-freight environment, goods are wrapped in boxed, compressed-packaged
 express yaa parcel ke vipareet, el tii el vaahak ko apni swayan kii packaging pradaan kerani chahie, jaisaa ki vaahak kisi bhi packaging kii aapurti yaa sahaayta pradaan nahin karte hai
 However, thongs or other adequate packaging may be required depending on the circumstances
 packaging kii aavashyaktaa or aakaar ke sandarbh main hawaii maal haada bahut kuch el tii el ke samaan he
 However, air screws or air cargo shipments typically require speeds exceeding 800 km or 497 miles per day
 hawaii shipment ko vaahak ke saath sidhe, dallalon ke madhyam se yaa online bazaar sevaaon ke saath book kar sakate hai
 While shipment is faster than standard LTL, air shipment is not always airborne
 sanyukt rajya america main, 7,000 kigram se bade shipment ko vishesh rup se trekklod fret main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 It is more efficient and economical for a large shipment because a larger trailer is typically useful rather than a shared space on a smaller LTL trailer
 sanyukt rajya america main ek lod kiye hue trek kaa kul vajan 36,000 kigram se adhik nahin kar sakate {tathy}
 Under normal circumstances, the weight of long-haul equipment is around 15,000 kg, about 20,000 kg for letting out of freight
 Likewise to limit the load in the available space of a trailer, typically 48 feet or 53 feet long, 2
6 m ॰ wide, 2
7 m ॰ high and 13 ft 6 in
 Or 4
11 m ॰ * high
 jabaki express parcel or el tii el shipment upkaran ke ek tukade par anya shipment ke saath hameshaa antarmishrit hote rahete hai or aam taur par unke parivahan ke dauraan upkarnon ko kai tukdon main punah lod kiya jaataa he, tii el shipment aamtaur par ek trailor par ek hi shipment ke rup main yatra karte hai
 In fact, TL shipments are always delivered to the same trailer on which they were placed
 aksar, ek el tii el vaahak ko ek trekking company ke saath sidhe sampark karne ke bajaay ek haada dalal, online bazaar yaa anya madhyasth kaa upyog karke bachat kaa ehsaas ho saktaa he
 Brokers may receive direct to the market shop and carrier at a lower rate than smaller carriers
 el tii el bazaar main, bichauliye aamtaur par prakashit daron par 50% se 80% chhot praapt karte hai, jahaan ek chote vaahak ko keval 5% se 30% discount kii peshkash kii jaati he
 Intermediaries are licensed by the DOT department and have to provide proof of insurance when requirements arise
 trekklod vaahak aamtaur kilometre yaa prati mile ke dar par charge karte hai
 Rate depends on distance, geographic location of the device, type of equipment, equipment required and service time
 upar varnit el tii el ke samaan hi tii el shipment ko bhi aamtaur par kai tarah ke adhibhaar praapt hote hai
 Compared to the LTL market, there are thousands more smaller carriers in the TL market
 isliye, parivahan madhyasthon yaa dallalon ke istemaal behad aam he
 Another saving method is to go to the carrier's terminals and deliver the goods
 aisa karne se, vaahak kisi bhi prakaar kaa sahaayak shulk, saamaanya shulk liftget, awasaiya sangrah / vitaran yaa soochna / niyuktiyon ke liye shulk le sakate hai, jisase bachaa ja saktaa he
 Carriers or intermediaries can provide origin / or destination details of the nearest shipping terminal with the address and phone number of the consignor
 shipping visheshgy kai vaahak, dallalon or online bazaaron se mili namoonay ke anukool apni seva or laagat tay karte hai
 After receiving rates from various providers, carriers can offer pricing across a wide range
 agar ek vaahak ke paas ek dalal he, to fret farorder yaa anya parivahan madhyasth kaa upyog karata he, yah aam he ki vaahak sangheey oparating praadhikaran kii ek prati praapt karte hai
 Freight brokers and middlemen must also be licensed from the Federal Highway Administration as required by federal law
 anbhavi vaahakon ko bina license vaale dallalon or preshak se bachanaa chahie kyonki agar dalal kanoon ke baahar jaakar koi kaam karte hai jise sangheey aaparating dwaara license praapt nahin hai, to vaahak ko ek samasya kii sthiti main koi suraksha nahin milti he
 In addition, the carrier should normally ask for a copy of the insurance broker's certificate and any specific insurance that applies for shipment
 sarkarein maal ke shipment ke liye bahut chintit rahati hai, kyonki yah suraksha kii drushti se ek desh ke liye jokhim laa saktaa he
 Therefore, many governments have implemented some regulations and enacted regulations administered by the Customs Department, to reduce crime, terrorism and other threats to cargo handling
 ek desh kii simaaon se hokar maal pravesh karata he isi kaaran yah vishesh rup se chintaa kaa vishay he
 The United States is the leader in securing cargo safely

 More than 6 million cargoes enter the ports of the United States every year, after the September 11 terrorist attack, whose safety is specially taken care of

 The entire revolution was the idea and slogan of Jayaprakash Narayan, which he called for the overthrow of Indira Gandhi's power
 lokanayak nen kaha ki sampoorn kranti main saat krantiyaan shaamil he - rajnatik, aarthik, saamaajik, saanskrithik, bauddhik, shaikshanik va aadhyatmik kranti
 There is a complete revolution by including these seven revolutions
 patna ke aitihaasik gandhi maidan main jaiprakash narayan ne sampurna kranti kaa aahwan kiya tha
 Millions of people present on the field had vowed to give up caste, tilak, dowry and discrimination

 The slogan was echoed: sampoorn kranti kii tapish itani bhayanak thi ki kendra main congress ko satta se haath dhonaa pad gaya tha

 Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje or Shambhaji Maratha Emperor and successor of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
 us samay marathaon ke sabase prabal shatru mughal badshaah aurangzeb bijapur or golkunda kaa shashan hindustan se samaapt karne main unki pramukh bhoomika rahi
 Sambhaji Raje was very famous for his bravery
 sambhaji maharaj ne apane kam samay ke shashan kaal main 140 yuddh kiye or isame ek pramukh baat ye thi ki unki sena ek bhi yuddh main parabhoot nahin hui
 Disturbed by his valor, Aurangzeb, the emperor of Delhi, vowed that unless Chhatrapati Sambhaji would be caught, he would not put his kimonsha on his head
 chhatrapati sambhaji nau varsh kii avasthaa main punyashlok chhatrapati shri chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kii prasiddh agra yatra main ve saath gayi the
 Departed from the detention house of Aurangzeb, Sambhaji was awarded the rank of king by the Mughal emperor and Panchajhari Mansab, as a result of the agreement with the Mughals, on the return of Punyashlok Chhatrapati Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to Maharashtra
 aurangabad kii mughal chhavnee main, maratha sena ke saath, uski niyukti hui 
 This job was not acceptable to him while being the son of the reigning king
 kintu hindai swarajya sthapana kii shuru ke din hone ke kaaran or pita punyashlok chhatrapati shri shivaji maharaj ke aadesh ke paalan hetu keval 9 saal ke umr main hi itnaa jimmedaari kaa lekin apmaan janak kaary unhone dhiraj se kiya
 He wrote the three Sanskrit texts Buddhabhushan, Nakhshikh, Nayikabheda and Sathataka in only 14 years of his age
 punyashlok chhatrapati shri shivaji maharaj ke rajbhishek or hindu swarajya ke baad sthapit ashtapradhan mantrimandal main se kuch logon kii raajkaaran ke vajah se yah samvedansheel yuvaraj kaaphi kshatigrast hue the
 Despite being mighty, he was kept away from many battles
 swabhaavat: samvedansheel rahanevaale sambhaji raaje unke pita shivaji maharaj ji ke ajna anusaar mughaalo ko ja mili taaki ve unhe gumraah kar sake
 Because at that time Maratha army had returned from Digvijay in the south direction and they needed time to get excited again
 isaliye mughaalo ko gumraah karane ke liye punyashlok chhatrapati shri shivaji maharaj ji ne hi unhe bhej tha vah ek rajtantr tha
 Later, Chhatrapati Shri Shivaji Maharaj Ji freed him from the Mughals
 magar is prayaas main wo patni rani durgabai or bahen godavari unako apane saath len main asafal rahe
 After the death of Punyashlok Chhatrapati Shivaji Shri Maharaj, some people tried to thrice Anuj Rajaram of Dharmaveer student father Shri Sambhaji Maharaj
 kintu senapati mohite ke rahete yah karsthan naakaamayaab hua or 10 janvari 1681 ko sambhaji maharaj kaa vidhiwat rajbhishek hua
 In the same year, the rebellious son of Aurangzeb, Akbar, fled south and took shelter of Dharmaveer student Sambhaji Maharaj
 akele mogul, portuguese, angrez tathaa anya shatruon ke saath ladane ke saath hi unhen antargat shatruonse bhi ladanaa padaa
 Rajaram Samarthakone, who failed to make Rajaram as Chhatrapati, wrote a letter requesting Aurangzeb's son Akbar to invade the kingdom and make it a mark of the Mughal Empire
 kintu dharmaveer chhatrapati shri sambhaji maharaj ke parakram se parichit or unka ashrith hone ke kaaran akbar ne vah patr chhatrapati sambhaji ko bhej diya
 Enraged by this treason, Chhatrapati Srisambhaji Maharaj gave death sentence to his feudatories
 tathaapi un main se ek balaji aavji naamak samant kii samadhi bhi unhone banaayin jinke maafi kaa patr chhatrapati sambhaji ko un samant ke mrityu pashchaat mila
 In 1683 he defeated the Portuguese
 isi samay vah kisi rajkeey kaaran se sangameshwar main rahe the
 The day he was about to leave for Rayagada, on the same day some gramasthas wanted to accuse him of his problem
 jiske chalate chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj ne apane saath keval 200 sainik rakh ke baaki sena ko raigarh bhej diya
 At the same time, one of his friends, whom he had refused to give, was sent by Mughal chieftain Mukarb Khan with an army of 5000 by secret route
 yah vah rasta tha jo sirf maraathon ko pataa tha
 Therefore Sambhaji Maharaj never felt that the enemy could come from this
 unhone ladane kaa prayaas kiya kintu itani badi fuj ke saamne 200 sainikon kaa pratikaar kaam kar na paaya or apane mitra tathaa ekmaatr salaahkaar kavikalash ke saath vah bandi bana liye gaye 
 Aurangzeb got the tongue of both of them, threw his eyes out
 11 march 1689 hindu navvarsh din ko donon ke sharir ke tukde kar ke aurangzeb ne hatya kar di
 But it is said that before the murder Aurangzeb told Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj that if one of my 4 sons was like you, then the whole of Hindustan would have been merged in the Mughal Sultanate
 jab chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj ke tukde tulapur kii nadi main phenken gaye to us kinare rahane vaale logon ne wo ikaitha kar ke sila ke jod die jis ke uparaant unka vidhipurvak antyasanskaar kiya
 Aurangzeb thought that the Marathi empire would end with the death of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj
 chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj ke hatya kii vajah se saare maratha ek saath aakar ladane lage
 Therefore Aurangzeb had to die in the Deccan itself
 uskaa dakkhan jeetne kaa sapana isi bhoomi main dafan ho gaya
 Despite being such a courageous and good ruler, due to less knowledge, his character is shown as a characterless and addictive king
 yah kaaphi achambhe kii baat he ke chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj ke bare main likhi gayi bate ye unke mrityu ke pashchaat 100 saal guzarane par likhi gayi, sambhaji maharaj or aurangzeb kaa sangharsh satta kaa sangharsh tha
 This sacrifice of Shri Sambhaji Maharaj, Dharmveer student, and the work of tormenting them, the Mughals kept on moving for a month at the behest of Aurangzeb and tortured them all the time and finally killed him by breaking his legs from neck to neck
 Before all this happened, Krurkarma and Dharmandha Aurang had asked them to renounce their Hindu religion and adopt the Muslim religion of the Mughals, but the son of the erstwhile Hindu king Chhatrapati Sri Shivajiraj and keep full devotion and devotion to his Hindu religion
 The decision to not accept Islam at all was told to Aurang
 In this anger, Aurangzeb had beaten him all over the entire month
 This whole month, Shree Shivpratisthan Hindusthan From the name of the organization, in the country of India, where the work of this organization is there, the devotion of this Dharmveer Chhatrapati Shri Sambhajirajen was completely followed
 Is God is sacrificing her It is said
