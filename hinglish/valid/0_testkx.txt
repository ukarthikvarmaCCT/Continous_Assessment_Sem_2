 chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kaa vivaah san 14 may 1640 main saibai nimbalkar ke saath laal mahal, puna main hua tha

 He had started the construction of the fort by bringing Maval youths
 maawalon kaa sahyog shivaji maharaj ke liye baad main utana hi mahatvapurn sabit hua jitna shershah suri ke liye afagaanon kaa saath
 At that time Bijapur was troubled by mutual struggle and Mughal invasion
 bijapur ke sultan adilshaah ne bahut se durgon se apni sena hataakar unhen sthaneey shaskaon yaa samanton ke haath saunp diya tha
 When Adilshah fell ill, anarchy spread in Bijapur and Shivaji Maharaj took advantage of the opportunity and decided to enter Bijapur
 shivaji maharaj ne iske baad ke dinon main bijapur ke durgon par adhikaar karne kii niti apanaai
 The first fort was the fort of Toran
 torana kaa durg puna ke dakshin pashchim main 30 kilometre kii duuri par tha
 Shivaji sent his envoy to Sultan Adilshah and informed him that he was ready to pay better money than the first fortress and handed over this area to him
 unhone adilshaah ke darbariyon ko pehle hi rishwat dekar apane paksh main kar liya tha or apane darbariyon kii salaah ke mutabik adilshaah ne shivaji maharaj ko us durg kaa adhipati bana diya
 Shivaji Maharaj got the work done to repair the deficiencies of the fort with the property found in that fort
 isse koi 10 kilometre dur rajgad kaa durg tha or shivaji maharaj ne is durg par bhi adhikaar kar liya
 When Adilshah got the idea of shivaji Maharaj's policy of expanding this empire, he was upset
 usne shahji raaje ko apane putr ko niyantran main rakhane ko kaha
 Shivaji Maharaj, regardless of his father, took over the management of his father's territory in his hands and stopped regular renting
 rajgad ke baad unhone chaakan ke durg par adhikaar kar liya or uske baad kondana ke durg par
 While taking possession of Kondana, he had to bribe
 usake baad aurangzeb ne mirzaraja jaisingh ko bhejkar 23 kilon par kabja kiya baad main shiji maharaj ke mawala tanaji malusre ne kondhana durg par kabja kiya par us yuddh main vah viragati ko praapt hua uski yaad main kondana par adhikaar karne ke baad uskaa naam singhgarh rakhaa gaya
 Shahaji Raje was given the title of Poona and Soupa and the fortress of Soupa was in the hands of his relative Baji Mohite
 shivaji maharaj ne raat ke samay soopa ke durg par akraman karke durg par adhikaar kar liya or baaji mohite ko shahji raaje ke paas karnataka bhej diya
 Some part of his army also came in the service of Shivaji Maharaj
 isi samay purandar ke kiledaar kii mrityu ho gai or kile ke uttaradhikaar ke liye uske teenon beton main ladaai chhid gai
 Shivaji Maharaj reached Purandar on the invitation of two brothers and, taking recourse to diplomacy, he imprisoned all the brothers
 is tarah purandar ke kile par bhi unka adhikaar sthapit ho gaya
 In the event so far, Shivaji Maharaj did not have to do any war or bloodshed
 1647 isvi tak ve chaakan se lekar nira tak ke bhubhag ke bhi adhipati ban chuke the
 With his increased military power, Shivaji Maharaj planned to enter the plains
 ek ashwarohi sena kaa gathan kar shivaji maharaj ne aabaaji sonder ke netritv main konkan ke viruddh ek sena bheji
 Abaji captured nine other fortifications including Konkan

 All the property looted was kept safe in Raigad
 kalyaan ke governor ko mukt kar shivaji maharaj ne kolaba kii ore rukh kiya or yahan ke pramukhon ko videshiyon ke kilaaf yuddh ke liye uksaaya
 Sultan of Bijapur was already in a rage before Shivaji Maharaj's antics
 usne shivaji maharaj ke pita ko bandi banane kaa aadesh de diya
 Shahaji Raje was in Karnataka at the time and was taken prisoner by a treacherous assistant Baji Ghorpade and brought to Bijapur
 un par yah bhi aarope lagaaya gaya ki unhone qutubashah kii seva praapt karne kii koshish kii thi jo golconda kaa shaasha tha or is kaaran adilshaah kaa shatru
 After the mediation of two chieftains of Bijapur, Shahaji Maharaj was freed on the condition that he would control Shivaji Maharaj
 agle chaar varshon tak shivaji maharaj ne bijipur ke kilaaf koi akraman nahin kiya
 During this time he organized his army
 shahji kii mukti kii sharton ke mutabik shivaji rajane bijapur ke kshetron par akraman to nahin kiya par unhone dakshin-pashchim main apni shakti badhaane kii cheshtaa kii
 But in this order the state of Javali was acting as a hindrance
 yah rajya satara ke sudur uttar pashchim main vama or krishna nadi ke bich main sthit tha
 The king here was Chandrarao More, who received this manor from Shivaji
 shivaji ne more shaasha chandrarav ko swaraj main shamil hone ko kaha par chandrarav bijapur ke sultan ke saath mil gaya
 In 1656, Shivaji attacked Javali with his army
 chandrarav more or uske donon putron ne shivaji ke saath ladaai kii par ant main ve bandi bana liye gaye par chandrarav bhaag gaya
 The local people opposed this act of Shivaji but they succeeded in crushing the rebellion
 isse shivaji ko us durg main sangrahit aath vanshon kii sampatti mil gai
 Apart from this, many Maval soldiers Murarabaji Deshpande also joined Shivaji's army
 shivaji ke bijapur tathaa mughal donon shatru the
 At that time, Shahzada Aurangzeb was the Subedar of Deccan
 isi samay 1 navambar 1656 ko bijapur ke sultan adilshaah kii mrityu ho gai jiske baad bijapur main araajaktaa kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya
 Taking advantage of this situation, Aurangzeb invaded Bijapur and Shivaji attacked him instead of supporting Aurangzeb
 unki sena ne junnar nagar par akraman kar dher sari sampatti ke saath 200 ghode lut liye
 Apart from 700 horses, four elephants from Ahmednagar, they looted the fort of Gunda and Resin
 iske parinamswaroop aurangzeb shivaji se khafaa ho gaya or maitri vaarta samaapt ho gai
 On the orders of Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb made a treaty with Bijapur and at the same time Shah Jahan fell ill
 uske vyaadhigrast hote hi aurangzeb uttar bharat chalaa gaya or vahaan shahjahan ko kaid karne ke baad mughal samrajya kaa shah ban gaya
 Knowing the absence of Aurangzeb in South India and the political situation in Bijapur, Shivaji asked Samarji to attack Janjira
 par zanjeera ke siddiyon ke saath unki ladaai kai dinon tak chali
 After this Shivaji himself invaded Janjira and took control of South Konkan and collected annual tax from the Portuguese of Daman
 kalyaan tathaa bhiwandi par adhikaar karne ke baad vahaan nausainik adda bana liya
 By this time, Shivaji had become the owner of 40 fortifications
 idhar aurangzeb ke agra laut jane ke baad bijapur ke sultan ne bhi raahat kii saans lee
 Now Shivaji was the most powerful enemy of Bijapur
 shahji ko pehle hi apane putr ko niyantran main rakhane ko kaha gaya tha par shahji ne isamen apni asamarthta jaahir kii
 The Sultan of Bijapur sent Abdullah Bhatari against Shivaji to deal with Shivaji
 afajal ne 12 xxrep 4 0 sainikon ke saath 1659 main kooch kiya
 Destroying the temples of Tuljapur, he came to Shiraval, 30 km north of Satara
 par shivaji pratapgarh ke durg par hi rahe
 Afzal Khan sent his envoy Krishnaji Bhaskar for a treaty
 usne uske marfat ye sandesh bhijwaya ki agar shivaji bijapur kii adheenta sweekaar kar le to sultan use un sabhi kshetron kaa adhikaar de denge jo shivaji ke niyantran main hai
 At the same time, Shivaji will receive an honored position in the court of Bijapur
 haalanki shivaji ke mantri or salaahkaar as sandhi ke paksh main the par shivaji ko ye vaarta raas nahin ai
 He gave proper respect to Krishnaji Bhaskar and placed it in his court and sent his messenger Gopinath to Afzal Khan to take stock of the situation
 gopinath or krishnaji bhaskar se shivaji ko aisa laga ki sandhi kaa shadyantra rachakar afjal khan shivaji ko bandi bananaa chahta he
 Therefore, he sent a valuable gift to Afzal Khan in exchange for war and thus persuaded Afzal Khan to negotiate
 sandhi sthal par donon ne apane sainik ghaat lagaakar rakhe the milane ke sthaan par jab donon mili tab afjal khan ne apane katyar se shivaji pe waar kiya bachaav main shivaji ne afjal khan ko apane vastron vaghankho se maar diya 
 After the death of Afzal Khan, Shivaji took control of the fort of Panhala
 iske baad pavangadh or vasantgarh ke durgon par adhikaar karne ke saath hi saath unhone rustam khan ke akraman ko vifal bhi kiya
 With this they also captured Rajapur and Dawul
 ab bijapur main aatank kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya or vahaan ke samanton ne aapasi matbhed bhulaakar shivaji par akraman karne kaa nishchay kiya
 On 2 October 1665, the Bijapuri army captured the Panhala fort
 shivaji sankat main funs chuke the par raatri ke andhkaar kaa laabh uthaakar ve bhaagane main safal rahe
 The Sultan of Bijapur, taking command himself, withdrew his authority over Panhala, Pawangarh, looted Rajapur and killed the head of Shringargarh
 isi samay karnataka main siddijohar ke vidroh ke kaaran bijapur ke sultan ne shivaji ke saath samjhauta kar liya
 Shivaji's father Shahaji acted as a mediator in this treaty
 san 1662 main hui is sandhi ke anusaar shivaji ko bijapur ke sultan dwaara swatantra shaasha kii manyata mili
 According to this treaty, the area ranging from Kalyan in the north to Ponda in the south and from Indapur in the east to Davul in the west came under Shivaji's control
 shivaji kii sena main is samay tak 3 xxrep 4 0 paidal or 1000 ghudsavaar ho gaye the
 After the end of the race to become king in North India, Aurangzeb's attention shifted to the south
 wo shivaji kii badhati prabhutaa se parichit tha or usne shivaji par niyantran rakhane ke udyeshy se apane mamaa shysta khan ko dakshin kaa soobedaar niyukt kiya
 Shaiska Khan took 1,50,000 fos and took control of the fort of Supan and Chakan and reached Poona
 usne 3 saal tak mawal main lutmar ki
 One night Shivaji attacked him with his 350 Mavalos
 shysta to khidki ke raste batch nikalne main kaamyaab rahaa par use isi kram main apni chaar anguliyon se haath dhonaa padaa
 The sons of Shaista Khan, and forty guards and countless soldiers were slaughtered
 is ghatana ke baad aurangzeb ne shysta ko dakkan ke badale bengal kaa soobedaar bana diya or shahjada muajjam shysta kii jagah lene bheja gaya
 This victory increased Shivaji's reputation
 6 saal shaista khan ne apni 15 xxrep 4 0 fuj lekar raja shivaji kaa pura mulukh jalaakar tabah kar diya tha
 Therefore, Shivaji started looting in the Mughal territories to recover his damages
 surat us samay pashchimi vyapaariyon kaa garh tha or hindustani musalamaanon ke liye haj par jane kaa dwaar
 It was a prosperous city and its port was very important
 shivaji ne chaar hajaar kii sena ke saath 1664 main chah dinon tak surat ke dhanadya vyapaariyon ko lutaa
 They did not rob the common man and then returned
 is ghatana kaa zikr dach tathaa angrejon ne apane lekhon main kiya he
 By that time, European traders had settled in India and other Asian countries
 nadir shah ke bharat par akraman karne tak kisi bhi europea shakti ne bhartiya mughal samrajya par akraman karne kii nahin sochi thi
 Disgusted by the loot of Shivaji in Surat, Aurangzeb appointed Gaiyasuddin Khan as a faujdar of Surat in place of Inayat Khan
 or shahjada muajjam tathaa upasenapati raja jaswant singh kii jagah diler khan or raja jaisingh kii niyukti kii gai
 King Jai Singh attacked Shivaji with the support of Sultan of Bijapur, European powers and small feudatories
 is yuddh main shivaji ko haani hone lagi or haar kii sambhaavna ko dekhte hue shivaji ne sandhi kaa prastaav bheja
 According to this treaty in June 1665, Shivaji will give 23 fortifications to the Mughals and thus only 12 fort will be left with him
 in 23 durgon se hone vaali aamadani 4 lakh hun salanaa thi
 The areas of Balaghat and Konkan will be given to Shivaji, but he will have to pay 40 lakh Huns in 13 installments in return
 iske alaava prativarsh 5 lakh hun kaa rajasav bhi ve denge
 Shivaji himself will be free from being in Aurangzeb's court, but his son Shambhaji will have to fight in the Mughal court
 bijapur ke kilaaf shivaji mughalon kaa saath denge
 Shivaji was called to Agra where he felt that he was not getting proper respect
 iske kilaaf unhone apana rosh bhare darbar main dikhaaya or aurangzeb par vishwasghaat kaa aarope lagaaya
 Aurangzeb was angered by this and he saw Shivaji being detained and guarded by 5000 soldiers
 kuch hi dinon baad raja shivaji ko maar daalane kaa iraadaa aurangzeb kaa tha
 But both Shivaji and Sambhaji, with their courage and courage, managed to escape from it
 sambhaaji ko mathura main ek vishwasi brahman ke yahan chhod shivaji maharaj banaras, gayi, puri hote hue sakushal rajgad pahunch gaye 
 This gave the Marathas a new life
 aurangzeb ne jaisingh par shaq karke uski hatya vish dekar karvaa daali
 Shivaji signed a second treaty with the Mughals in 1668 after Jaswant Singh took the initiative
 aurangzeb ne shivaji ko raja kii manyata di
 Shivaji's son Shambhaji received a mansabdari of 5000 and Shivaji was returned to the districts of Poona, Chakan and Soupa
 par, singhgarh or purandar par mughalon kaa adhipaty bana rahaa
 Shivaji looted Surat city for the second time in 1670
 nagar se 132 lakh kii sampatti shivaji ke haath lagi or lautate vakt unhone mughal sena ko surat ke paas phir se haraaya
 By 1674, Shivaji had captured all the territories which had to be given to the Mughals under the Treaty of Purandar
 pashchimi maharashtra main swatantra hindu raashtra kii sthapana ke baad shivaji ne apana rajbhishek karnaa chaha, parantu muslim sainiko ne brahamanon ko dhamkee di ki jo bhi shivaji kaa rajbhishek karegaa unki hatya kar di jaayegi
 jab ye baat shivaji tak pahunchi kii mughal sardaar aise dhamkee de rahe he tab shivaji ne ise ek chunauti ke rup me liya or kaha kii ab wo us rajya ke brahamn se hi abhishek karavaayenge jo mughalon ke adhikaar main he
 shivaji ke nijee sachiv balaji ji ne kaashi main teen duto ko bheja, cunki kaashi mughal samrajya ke adheen tha
 jab duuton ne sandesh diya to kaashi ke brahamn kaaphi prasann huye
 kintu mughal sainiko ko yah baat pataa chal gai tab un brahmano ko pakad liya
 parantu yukti purvak un brahmanon ne mughal sannico ke samaksh un duuton se kaha ki shivaji koun he ham nahin jaanate he
 ve kis vansh se hai ? duuton ko pataa nahin tha isaliye unhone kaha hamen pataa nahin he
 tab mughal sainiko ke sardaar ke samaksh un brahmanon ne kaha ki hamen kahin anyatra janaa he, shivaji kis vansh se hai aapane nahin bataaya at: aise main ham unke rajbhishek kaisekar sakate hai
 ham to tirth yatra par ja rahe hai or kashika koi anya brahman bhi rajbhishek nahin karegaa jab tak raja kaa purna parichay na ho at: aap waapas ja sakate hai
 mughal sardaar ne khush hoke brahmano ko chod diya or duto ko pakad kar aurangzeb ke paas dilli bhejne kii sochi par wo bhi chup ke se nikal bhaage
 waapas laut kar unhone ye baat balaji aav tathaa shivaji ko bataai
 parantu aashcharya janak rup se do din baad vahi brahman apane shishyon ke saath raigarh pahuchen ore shivaji kaa rajbhishek kiya
 After this, the Mughals tried to divide and even after the coronation of Shivaji, threatened the Brahmins of Poona that they should not accept Shivaji as the king
 So that people do not even consider it !! But they did not work
 Shivaji established the Ashtapradhan Mandal
 Apart from the envoys, representatives of various states, foreign traders were also invited to this ceremony
 par unke rajbhishek ke 12 din baad hi unki mata kaa dehanth ho gaya tha is kaaran se 4 oktober 1674 ko duusari baar shivaji ne chhatrapati kii oopaadhi grahan kii
 The ceremony, which took place twice, cost about 50 lakh rupees
 is samaaroh main hindu swaraj kii sthapana kaa udghosh kiya gaya tha
 It was the first Hindu kingdom in the south after the fall of Vijayanagar
 ek swatantra shaasha kii tarah unhone apane naam kaa sikaa chalavaaya
 After this, the Sultan of Bijapur sent two of his commanders against Shivaji for the Konkan victory but they failed
 san 1677-78 main shivaji kaa dhyaan karnataka kii ore gaya
 On April 4, 1680, Shivaji passed away after commanding Konkan in south of Bombay, Belgaum and Dharwad region west of Tungabhadra river, Mysore, Valari, Trichur and Jinji
 teen saptaah kii beemaari ke baad shivaji kii mrityu 3 april 1680 main hui
 At that time, Sambhaji inherited Shivaji's succession
 shivaji ke jyeshtha putr sambhaji the or dusi patni se rajaraam naam ek doosraa putr tha
 At that time Rajaram was only 10 years old, so the Marathas accepted Shambhaji as the king
 us samay aurangzeb raja shivaji kaa dehant dekhakar apni puure bharat par rajya karne ki abhilasha se apni 5,00,000 sena sagar lekar dakshin bharat jeetne niklaa
 Aurangzeb finished Adilshi in 2 days and Qutb Shahi in 1 day
 par raja sambhaji ke netritv main marathao ne 9 saal yuddh karte huye apni swatantrata barkaraar rakhi
 Aurangzeb's son Shahzada Akbar revolted against Aurangzeb
 sambhaji ne usko apane yahan sharan di
 Aurangzeb now vigorously started attacking against Sambhaji
 usne antatah 1689 main sambhaji ke bivi ke sage bhai ne yane ganoji shirke kii mukhabari se sambhaji ko mukarav khan dwaara bandi bana liya
 Aurangzeb misbehaved with Raja Sambhaji and miserably killed him
 apni raja ko aurangzeb ne badasluki or buree haal maaraa hua dekhakar pura maratha swarajya krodhit hua
 He continued his struggle with the Mughals under the leadership of the Third Rajaram with his full strength
 1700 isvi main rajaraam kii mrityu ho gai
 After that Rajaram's wife Tarabai ruled as guardian of 4-year-old son Shivaji II
 aakhirkaar 25 saal maratha swarajya ke yuddh lad ke thake huye aurangzeb kii usee chhatrapati shivaji ke swarajya main dafan huye
 Shivaji is known as a skilled and enlightened emperor
 yadhyapi unako apane bachapan main parmparik shiksha kuch khaas nahin mili thi, par ve bhartiya itihaas or raajnneeti se suparichit the
 He considered Shukracharya and Kautilya to be ideal and resorted to diplomacy many times
 apane samakaleen mughalon kii tarah vah bhi nirankush shaasha the, arthath shashan kii samoochee bagdor raja ke haath main hi thi
 But there was a council of eight ministers called Ashtapradhan to help with his administrative work
 isamen mantriyon ke pradhan ko peshwa kehete the jo raja ke baad sabase pramukh hasti tha
 Amatya used to look after the functions of finance and revenue, then the minister used to take care of the personal diary of the king
 sachiv dafatari kaam karte the jisame shahi muhar lagaana or sandhi patron kaa aalekh taiyaar karnaa shaamil hote the
 Sumant was the foreign minister
 sena ke pradhan ko senapati kehete the
 The head of charity and religious affairs was called Panditrao
 nyaayadhish nyaayik maamalon kaa pradhan tha
 The Maratha Empire was divided into three or four divisions
 prayek praant main ek soobedaar tha jise prantapati kaha jaataa tha
 Each Subedar also had an Ashtapradhan Committee
 kuch praant keval karadaata the or prashasan ke maamle main swatantra
 The judiciary was based on the ancient system
 shukracharya, kautilya or hindu dharamshastron ko aadhaar maanakar nirnay diya jaataa tha
 The Patel of the village used to investigate criminal cases
 rajya kii aay kaa saadhan bhoomikar tha par chouth or sardeshmukhi se bhi rajasav vasula jaataa tha
 'chauth' was a tax levied to guarantee the security of neighboring states
 shivaji apane ko maraathon kaa sardeshmukh kahata the or isi haisiyat se sardeshmukhi kar vasula jaataa tha
 After the coronation, he entrusted the work of one of his ministers to form suitable Sanskrit words for the Persian words used in the government
 ramachandra amaatya ne dhundhiraj naamak vidwaan kii sahaayta se 'rajyavyavahaarkosh' naamak granth nirmit kiya
 This dictionary had Sanskrit words equivalent to 1380 Persian administrative words
 isamen ramachandra ne likhaa he- Shivaji was a devoted Hindu and he was also religious tolerant
 unke samrajya main musalamaanon ko dharmik swatantraaa thi
 Shivaji gave grants for the construction of many mosques
 hindu panditon kii tarah musalmaan santon or fakiron ko bhi sammaan praapt tha
 There were also Muslim soldiers in his army
 shivaji hindu sankruti ko badhaava dete the
 The emphasis was on traditional Hindu values and education
 vah apane abhiyaanon kaa armbh bhi akasar dashahra ke avasar par karte the
 Shivaji Maharaj got Swaraj's education from his father, when the Sultan of Bijapur made Shahji Raje a prisoner, then like an ideal son he made a treaty with the Shah of Bijapur and got Shahji Raje released
 isse unke charitra main ek udaar avyav hojar aata he
 Later, he did not kill his father as other emperors did
 shahji raaje ke marane ke baad hi unhone apana rajbhishek karavaaya hanlanki wo us samay tak apane pita se swatantra hokar ek bade samrajya ke adhipati ho gayi the
 His leadership was accepted by everyone, that is why there was no major incident like internal rebellion during his reign
 vah ek achche senanayake ke saath ek achche kootneetijna bhi the
 In many places he had run away from the war instead of fighting directly
 lekin yahi unki kootneeti thi, jo har baar bade se bade shatru ko maat dene main unka saath detii rahi
 Shivaji Maharaj's diplomacy called "ganimi Kawa", in which a sudden attack on the enemy is defeated by him, is remembered fondly and with no respect

more -OH groups, the compounds formed are called alcohols
 yogic me upasthit -OH samooh kii sankhya ke aadhaar par ise chaar bhaago me baanta gaya he
 It is divided into three parts: - 1
 Primary Alcohol: - When the hydrogen atom is substituted from the primary carbon by the -OH group, the primary alcohol is formed
 jaise :- methenul
 Secondary alcohol: - When the hydrogen atom is substituted from the secondary carbon by the -OH group, the secondary alcohol is formed
 jaise :- 2-propenul tritiyak alcohol :- jab tritiyak carbon se hydrogen parmaanu kaa pratisthaapan -OH samooh dwaara kar diya jaataa he to tritiyak alcohol banataa he
 Such as: - Methyl propane 2-all
 alcohol kaa namakaran :- There are several methods of manufacturing alcohol: - udyog main methil alcohol tathaa ethil alcohol kaa pramukh sthaan he
 Until recently, methyl alcohol in commercial quantities was obtained only by dry distillation of wood
 is vidhi main lakdi ko lohe ke bade-bade bakyantron main, jinamein sheetak lage rahete hai, hawa kii anupasthiti main 500° centegrade par garm karne se nimnlikhit padaarth banate hai : The acid is separated from the pyroliginous acid as calcium acetate; Now the liquid that remains is separated from the lime by dissolving acetone
 is kasht spirit main shuddh methil alcohol 70 se 80% tak hota he
 In this method the expenditure is more and the attainment of alcohol is less
 at: udyog ke liye alcohol sanshleshan vidhi dwaara taiyaar karte hai
 At fifty or more atmospheric pressure, the hydro-gas with an appropriate catalyst at 400 ° C
 But by heating, methyl alcohol is formed
 methil alcohol teevr vishaiylla padaarth he
 Thus, its main purpose is to make ethyl alcohols a must
 laah or rezin ke liye, jinka upyeg varnish tathaa polish ke udyog main hota he yah ek upyukt vileyak he
 By oxidizing it, it is also used more in the manufacture of formaldeamine, artificial colors, medicines and aromatic substances

 In 1894, his father's company could not get a contract to supply for electric lighting in the city of Munich
 jiske kaaran huye nuksaan se unhen apni company bechni pad gai
 In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, where they first settled in Milan and then a few months later in the city of Pavia

 Throughout his lifetime, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles
 unhone 300 se adhik vaigyanik or 150 gaiyr-vaigyanik shodh-patr prakashit kiye
 In his 1965 lecture, Oppenheimer noted that Einstein's early writings had many errors that caused his publication to be delayed by nearly ten years: "a man whose errors took a long time to correct, how much Would be great "

 These four articles have contributed greatly to the foundation of modern physics and changed the thinking of people on space, time and matter
 ye chaar kagajaat hai: In 1900, Einstein's first research paper was on "capillary attraction", presented to Onlen der Physik
 yah 1901 main " "keshikatv ghatana se nishkarsh" sheershak ke saath prakashit kiya gaya
 Two papers published in 1902–1903 attempted to explain atomic phenomena through statistical means

 Einstein concludes that each wave of frequency is associated with a collection of photons of energy
 unhone is bare main or adhik nahin bataaya, kyonki ve aashwast nahin the kii kaise kan, laharo se sambandhit hai
 But he suggested that this hypothesis could be explained by some experimental results, which were later specifically called the photoelectric effect
 1907 main, oinstin ne ek model prastaavit kiya, kii prayek parmaanu, ek jaali sanrachana main swatantra anuroop rup se dolan karata he
 In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently
 Einstein knew that real oscillations have different frequencies but still proposed this theory, because it was a clear demonstration of how quantum mechanics, in conventional mechanics, is associated with specific heat

 International trade is the exchange of capital, goods, and services across international borders or territories
 
 adhikansh deshon main, yah sakal gharelu utpaada ke mahatvapurn ansh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 While international trade has been present for most of its history, its economic, social and political importance has begun to increase in recent centuries
 antarrashtriya vyapaar vyavastha par audyogikaran, unnat parivahan, vaishvikaran, bahurashtriya nigam or bahyasrot se kaarynishpaadan, in sabhi kaa vyapak prabhaav padataa he
 Increasing international trade is important for the continuation of globalization
 antarrashtriya vyapaar ke bina, desh sirf apni khud kii seemaa ke bheetar utpaadit maal or sevaaon tak simit rah jaaenge
 International trade is no different from domestic trade in principle because the motivation and behavior of the parties involved in a trade does not change fundamentally, regardless of whether the trade is cross-border or not
 mukhya antar yah he ki antarrashtriya vyapaar aam taur par gharelu vyapaar se adhik mahangaa he
 The reason for this is that a border usually imposes additional charges such as tariffs, periodic costs due to delays on the border and costs associated with country variations such as language, legal system or culture
 gharelu or antarrashtriya vyapaar ke bich ek or antar yah he ki puunji or shram jaise utpaadan kaarak aam taur par baahar kii tulana main deshon ke bheetar adhik gatisheel hote hai
 Thus international trade is mostly limited to the trade of goods and services and only on a small scale in trade of capital, labor or other factors of production
 In addition, trade in goods and services can act as a substitute for trade in production factors
 utpaadan kaa ek kaarak aayaat karne ke bajaay, ek desh maal aayaat kar saktaa he jo utpaadan ke kaarak kaa gahan istemaal kare or is prakaar sambandhit kaarak ko sammilit kar le
 ek udhaaharan he, china se sanyukt rajya america dwaara shram-pradhan vastuon kaa aayaat
 chini shram kaa aayaat karne ke bajaay america, china se aise maal aayaat kar rahaa he jise chini shram ke istemaal se utpaadit kiya gaya he
 International trade is also a branch of economics, which together with international finance forms the broad branch of international economics
 vyapaar kii paddati kaa purvanumaan lagane or prashulk jaisi vyapaar nitiyon ke prabhaav kaa vishleshan karne ke liye anek alag namoonay prastaavit kiye gaye hai
 The Ricardian model focuses on comparative advantage and is perhaps the most important concept in international trade theory
 ek ricardian model main, desh un chizon ke utpaadan main visheshgyata hasil karte hai jin chizon kaa utpaadan ve acha karte hai
 Unlike other models, the Ricardian framework predicts that countries will specialize instead of producing a wide range of goods
 iske alaava, ricardian model kaarak nidhi par sidhe vichaar nahin karata, jaise desh ke bheetar shram or puunji kii saapeksh maatra
 ricardin model kaa pramukh laabh yah he ki yah deshon ke bich praudyogiki bhinnataaon kii kalpana karata he
 The technology gap is easily incorporated into the Ricardian and ricardo-sraffa models
 ricardian model nimnlikhit anumaan lagaataa he: The Ricardian model makes short-term measurements, so the technology varies internationally
 yah is tathy kaa samarthan karata he ki desh apane tulanaatmak laabh kaa paalan karte hai or visheshgyata ke liye anumati dete hai
 The Ricardian business model was studied by Graham, Jones, Mackenzie and others
 sabhi siddhanton main madhyavarti maal, vasteen or puunjigat maal jaise vyapaarit input maal ko baahar rakhaa gaya
 mckenzie, Jones, and Samuelson emphasized that considerable profits would be lost by the exclusion of intermediate goods from trade
 In a famous comment Mackenzie stated that "the idea of a moment would explain to a person that Lancashire would be unlikely to produce cotton cloth if cotton had to be grown in England
" haal hi main, is siddhant ko vistaarit karte hue isamen vyapaarik madhyavarti maamle ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 Thus the "labor only" assumption was removed from the theory
 is prakaar nayaa ricardian siddhant, jise kabhi-kabhi ricardo-srapha model kaa naam bhi diya jaataa he, saidhantik rup se puunjigat vastuon ko shaamil karata he jaise mashine or samagriyaan, jinka deshon ke bich kaarobaar hota he
 In times of global trade, this assumption is more realistic than the heckscher-olin model, which assumes that capital is stable within the country and not internationally dynamic
 1900 ke dashak ke armbh main, do swedish arthshaastriyon, eli heksher or bertil olin ne kaarak anupaat siddhant naam ke ek antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant kaa srijan kiya
 This theory is also called the heckscher-olin theory
 heksher-olin siddhant is baat par jor detaa he ki deshon ko aise maal kaa utpaadan or niryaat karnaa chahie jise aise sansadhano kii aavashyaktaa ho, jo prachur hon or aise maal kaa aayaat karnaa chahie jise alp-aapurti vaale sansadhano kii aavashyaktaa ho
 This theory differs from the theories of comparative advantage and absolute advantage because these theories focus on the productivity of the production process for a particular commodity
 iske vipareet, heksher-olin siddhant kahata he ki ek desh ko utpaadan or niryaat main un karkon kaa upyog karte hue visheshgy hona chahie jo sabase prachur maatra main hon or isliye saste hon
 un maal kaa utpaadan naa karen, jaisaa ki pehle ke siddhanton ne kaha, jo ve sabase adhik kushalta se utpaadit karte hai
 The Heckscher – Olin model was constructed as an alternative to the Ricardian model of basic comparative advantage
 isaki adhik jatilta ke baavjood yah apane purvanumaanon main adhik sateek sabit nahin hua
 But from a theoretical point of view it provides an elegant solution by incorporating neo-classical value mechanisms into international trade theory

 The HO model makes the following main assumptions: H-O siddhant ke saath samasya yah he ki yah puunjigat vastuon ke vyapaar ko shaamil nahin karata he 
H-O siddhant main, shram or puunji, prayek desh ke liye sthir padaarth hai
 In a modern economy, capital goods are traded internationally
 madhyavarti vastuon ke vyapaar se laabh kaaphi hota hai, jaisaa ki samuelson dwaara bal diya gaya tha 
 Many economists prefer the Heckscher – Olin theory than the Ricardo theory, as it makes less straightforward assumptions
 1953 main, wesile leontiff ne ek adhyayan prakashit kiya, jahaan unhone heksher-olin siddhant kii vaidhata kaa pareekshan kiya
 adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki anya deshon kii tulana main america puunji main adhik prachur tha, isliye america puunji-pradhan maal kaa niryaat kar rahaa tha or shram-pradhan maal kaa aayaat
 leontiff ne paaya ki aayaat kii tulana main america kaa niryaat kam puunji-pradhan tha
 After the Leontief paradox emerged, many researchers tried to save the heckscher-olin theory, either by new methods of measurement, or by new interpretations
 Leamer emphasized that Leontief did not correctly interpret the HO theory and claimed that contradiction did not occur with a correct interpretation

 Estimates of HO are less realistic regarding NS than NN trade
 uttar or dakshin ke bich aay bhinnata hi ek aisi chiz he jisaki teesri duniya ko sabase zyada parvaah hoti he

 This is very unrealistic

 In this model, labor mobility between industries is possible, while capital is stable between industries in the short term

 The specific factor name refers to what is provided, in the short term, specific factors of production such as physical capital are not easily transferable between industries
 siddhant yah suzav detaa he ki agar maal kii keemat main vruddhi hoti he, to us maal ke vishisht sandarbh main utpaadan ke kaarak ke maalikon ko vaastavik rup se acha laabh hoga
 In addition, owners of specific factors of anti-production are likely to have opposing agendas when they seek favors to control labor immigration
 iske vipareet, puunji or shram, donon ke maalikon ko puunji nidhi main vruddhi se vaastavik rup main laabh hota he
 This model is ideal for particular industries

 Under the belief in mercantilism for many centuries, customs were high and many restrictions on international trade in most countries

 Since then this notion has become the dominant thinking among the western countries

 These trade agreements, coupled with unfair trade claims that are not profitable for developing countries, have often led to protests and dissatisfaction
 mukt vyapaar kaa aam taur par, aarthik rup se sarvaadhik majboot deshon dwaara sabase adhik samarthan kiya jaataa he, haalanki ve aksar un udyogon ke liye chaynaatmak sangrakshanvaad main sanlagn hote hai jo ranneetik rup se mahatvapurn hai, jaise america or europe dwaara krishi par lagaaya jane vaala surakshatmak prashulk

 Traditionally agricultural interests generally favor free trade, while manufacturing sectors often support protectionism
 haalanki, haal ke varshon main isamen kuch had tak badlaav aayaa he
 In fact, agricultural groups, particularly in the United States, Europe, and Japan, are primarily responsible for specific regulations in major international trade treaties that allow for more protectionist measures in agriculture than most other goods and services

 Regulation of international trade is done globally through the World Trade Organization and through many other regional arrangements such as MERCOSUR in South America, the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico, and European between 27 independent countries Union
 The 2005 Buenos Aires negotiations on the planned establishment of the Free Trade Area of the Americas were thwarted mainly by opposition from the population of Latin American countries

 Companies trading across international borders face the same risks normally reflected in staunch domestic transactions

 pichley lekh main charchaa kii he ki kaise antarrashtriya kaarobaar kaa samarthan paristhitiki pranaaliyon or vyapaar ke anukool nitiyon kii jarurat he, to ve ubharate bazaaron main safal hone ke liye kar rahe hai
 Of particular importance is the role of governments in deciding whether they will allow international businesses to setup their operations and encourage them to grow and succeed
 aksar, kai deshon kii sarkaron ke liye ek vikalp nahin he lekin antarrashtriya kaarobaar kaa swaagat karne ke rup main ve "nakadi" yaa dollar kii jarurat he, kyonki ve bhi janaa jaataa he
 For example, the difference between exports and imports is known as current account deficit or CAD

 Then, governments can borrow losses at high rates or finance losses through FDI or foreign direct investment and equity flows from fiis or foreign institutional investors to the stock markets
 iske alaava, gharelu udyog kshamtaaon ko ek vishesh kshetra he or na hi visheshgyata he ki kshetra kaa vikaas karne main safal hone ke liye nahin ho saktaa he
 Therefore, FDI becomes necessary for the development of that region
 iske alaava, arthvyavastha ke khulne vishwa vyapaar sanghathan yaa vishwa vyapaar sanghathan, jiskaa matlab he ki aadesh main, anya deshon ko niryaat karne ke liye ubharate bazaar or vikasshil arthvyavasthaaon main kholane ke liye he ki main pravesh ke liye aavashyak he
 For this reason, many governments in developing countries are doing something to encourage and allow foreign investment in international businesses to operate the setup in their respective countries
 haalanki, ek hi sarkaron kii nitiyon ko jari rakhane yaa nahin kaarak he ki sarkaron kii vaicharik tula, raajnneeti kii majaburiyon, or tathy yah he ki videshi nivesh kii yojana banaai arthvyavastha ke rup main shuru kik main safal nahin ho saktaa he shaamil kii ek mejabaan par nirbhar karata he
 The important aspect here is that many governments in emerging economies often welcome international businesses with open arms because of the above reasons
 haalanki, bich main hi prakriya ke madhyam se, unamem se kuch nitigat pakshaaghaat kii vajah se thand pair viksit karne, or karkon se upar soochibaddh he
 It is understandable that allowing international businesses to enter emerging economies needs to be bipartisan meaning that there should be a broad consensus on the issue from all stakeholders
 tabhi to antarrashtriya kaarobaar ubhartee bazaar arthvyavasthaaon main kaamyaab hogi
 In addition, competition for foreign capital is so intense that the process in an adverse economy and therefore, the process must be continued and the reason given incentives affect international businesses

 On the other hand, India and Russia are in the other way of example these countries opened their economies due to compulsions with open arms and then but unsuccessfully around to maintain momentum
 iskaa matlab yah he ki vaishvik arthvyavastha main ekikaran hi hoga jab sudhaaron kii prakriya ko tahe dil se or ruk jaataa he yaa you-turn ke bina kiya jaataa he
