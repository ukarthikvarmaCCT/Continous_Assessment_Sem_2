 unki kalam se bal sahitya kii rachana bhi hui he
 His first song is a poetry collection
 is sangrah main 1924 se 1928 tak ke rachit geet sangrahit hai
 Mahadevi Verma's own statement regarding the content of the neehar is remarkable - "in the time of the creation of the nehra my sensations were filled with the same kind of mixed anguish, like the inexplicable golden usha that appears in the mind of the child and away from the touch of the cloud
 Arises from the first vision of " in geeton main kautuhal mishrit vednaa kii swaabhaavik abhivyakti hui he
 Rashmi is the second collection of poetry by Mahadevi Varma
 isamen 1927 se 1931 tak kii rachanaayen hai
 In this, the contemplation and philosophy of Mahadevi ji seems to be outspoken

 In Rashmi's thinking and philosophy is more clear and mature

 i have songs composed from 1934 to 1936 AD
 in geeton man neeraja ke bhaavon kaa paripakv rup miltaa he
 Here, there is a coordination not only of happiness and sorrow but also of tears and anguish, union and disunity, hope and despair and liberation
 deepashikha main 1936 se 1942 i0 tak ke geet hai
 The main rendition of the songs in this collection is to erase the self and make others happy
 yah mahadevi kii siddhavastha kaa kavy he, jisamen sadhika kii aatma kii deepashikha akampit or achanchal hokar aradhy kii akhand jyoti main villin ho gai he
 i have composed compositions composed in the last days of Mahadevi that will overwhelm and surprise the readers, in the sense that the tone of compassion and compassion in Mahadevi poetry, which has become their identity since then
 'agnirekha` main deepak ko pratik maanakar anek rachanaayen likhi gayi hai
 There are poems on many subjects as well
 deepashikha main mahadevi verma ke geeton kaa adhikarik vishay ‘prem’ he
 But they have found the significance of love more than the jubilant moments of union, in the agony of violence
 saptaparna main mahadevi ne apni saanskrithik chetana ke sahare veda, ramayana, ther gaatha, ashwaghosh, kalidas, bhawabhooti evam jayadev kii kritiyon se tadatmya sthapit karke 39 chaynit mahatvapurn anshon kaa hindi kavyanuwaad is prastut kiya he
 Initially in the 61-page 'apni Baat', he has also presented a deeply researched discussion about this invaluable heritage of Indian Manisha and literature
 ’saptaparna’ ke antargat arshvani, valmiki, thergatha, ashwaghosh, kalidas or bhawabhooti ke baad saatven sopan par mahadevi verma ne jayadev ko pratishthit kiya he
 He has told that Radhakrishna had acquired a reputation as the hero-heroine of Sringa poetry of Sanskrit when Jayadeva emerged
 


mahadevi ji ne ’saptaparna’ main sanskrit or pali sahitya ke chaynit anshon kaa kavyanuwaad prastut karte samay apni drushti bhartiya chintanadhara or saundaryabodh kii parampara ke itihaas par kendrit rakhi he
 This work of his is fully capable of establishing him as a successful creative poet, historian and culture thinker, no doubt
 nihar jivan ke ushakal kii hi rachana he, jisamen satya kuhajaal main chipa rah kar bhi mohak or kutuhalapurna prathit hoti he
 'rashmi' is the creation of the early days of puberty
 jab satya kii kirane aatma main gyaan kii jwaala jagaa detii hai
 'neerja' is a work of adult mental state of the poetess, in which she scatters her Saurabh in her bright path in the bright light of day like Kamalini
 'sandhyagit' main jivan ke sandhyakaal kii karunardrata or vairaygy bhaavana ke saath-saath aatma kii apane aadhyatmik ghar ko laut chalane kii pravriti vartmaan he
 In 'deepshikha', the spirit of Jeevan Deep burning in front of Aaradhya in the calm, snug and zero atmosphere of the night is prominent
 is prakaar unhone apane jivan ke ahoratr ko in paanch pratikatmak sheershakon main vibhakt kar apni jivan sadhana kaa marm spasht kar diya he
 As a result of this solitary practice of anguish, the diversity of subjects in Mahadevi's poetry is very low
 unki kuch hi kavitaayen aisi hai, jinamein rashtriya or saanskrithik udbodhan athwa prakruti kaa swatantra chithran hua he
 Due to the theme and approach being the same in all the remaining poems, his poetry ground could not be expanded
 isse unke kavy ko haani or laabh donon hua he
 The disadvantage is that due to non-change of subject, there is a lot of monotony and mood in all his poetry
 laabh yah hua he ki simit kshetra ke bheetar hi kavyitri ne anubhutiyon ke anekanek ayaamon ko anek drushtikonon se dekh-parakhkar unke sookshmatisookshm bhed-prabhedon ko bimbarup main saamne rakhte hue chitrit kiya he
 In this way, his poetry may not have the expansive vastness and philosophical gravity, but the seriousness and importance of his feelings, the subtlety of the senses, the clarity of the images and the lack of imagination, are sure
 is tarah unke kavy vistaar kaa nahin gaharaai kaa kavy he
 The poems of Mahadevi are not descriptive and chronological
 aantarik sookshm anubhutiyon kii abhivyakti unhone sahaj bhavochhavas ke rup main kii he
 For this reason there is a multiplicity of semiotics and expressiveness in his expression system
 rupakaatmak bimbon or pratikon ke sahare unhone jo mohak chitra upasthit kiye hai, ve unki sookshm drushti or rangamayi kalpana kii shaktimatta kaa parichay dete hai
 He has taken these pictures from his perspective, especially the natural environment, but he took nature very little as a stand
 prakruti unke kavy main sadaiv uddipan, alankaar, pratik or sanket ke rup main hi chitrit hui hai
 For this reason, he has made the most familiar and all-seeing scenes or objects of nature a gift of his poetry
 uske asaadhaaran or alpaparichit drishyon kii ore unka dhyaan nahin gaya he
 Nevertheless, the full or partial images he has depicted by limited natural products give a complete introduction to his pictorial imagination
 isi kalpana ke darshan unke un chitron main bhi hote hai, jo unhone shabdon se nahin, rangon or tulika ke madhyam se nirmit kiye hai
 His paintings have been published with poems in 'deepshikha' and 'yama'
 mahadevi verma ne likhaa he- 'kala ke paras kaa sparsh paa lene vaale kaa kalakaar ke atirikt koi naam nahin, sadhak ke atirikt koi varg nahin, satya ke atirikt koi poonji nahin, bhav-saundarya ke atirikt koi vyapaar nahin or kalyaan ke atirikt koi laabh nahin
 'during the writing period, he remained unanimous and made meaningful things written in the spiritual creation of uninterrupted pace and the practice of a life of karma
 ek mahadevi hi hai jinhone gadhy main bhi kavita ke marm kii anubhuti karai or 'gadhyan kavinaa nikshan vadanti' ukti ko charitaarth kiya he
 The unique thing is that neither he wrote the novel, nor the story, nor the drama is still the best prose
 unke granth lekhan main ek ore rekhachitr, sansmaran yaa phir yatravrit hai to duusari ore sampadakeey, bhoomikaaye, niabandh or abhibhaashan, par sabamein jaise sampurna jivan kaa vaividhya samaaya he
 Without the help of imaginative poetic forms, a creator can earn so much in prose, it can be known only by reading Mahadevi
 hindi sahitya main chandrakantha mani ke samaan dravanshil karun ras kii devi mahadevi verma na keval vishisht kalakaar, kavyitri or gadhy lekhika hai apitu isse aage ek shreshth nibandhkaar bhi hai
 His prose, like poetry, does not take us away from life by forgetting it in beauty, it gives us inspiration to peek into real life by filling our veins with consciousness
 smriti kii rekhaaen or ateet ke chalchitr main nirantar jigyaasa sheel mahadevi ne smriti ke aadhaar par amit rekhaon dwaara atyant sahrudaytapurvak jivan ke vividh roopon ko chitrit kar un paatro ko amar kar diya he
 These include a very strong and compassionate picture of the poor, the poor people of the village, the villagers, the widows, the widows, the remarriages and the abusers due to alleged corruptions and old-marriage
 keval naariyaan hi nahin, upekshit purush varg kaa bhi mahadevi ne sahi chithran kiya he
 The sketches of Rama, Ghisa, Alopi and Badlu etc
 point to his extraordinary humanism
 mahadevi ne adhikansh apane rekhachitron main nimnavargeey paatro kii visheshtaon, durbalataaon or samasyaon kaa chithran kiya he
 Sevak Rama's voracious service, Bhangin Sabia's husband-kindness and long-suffering, Ghisa's unquenchable devotion, saag-bhaji's seller blind Alopi's simple personality, Kumbhakar Badlu and Radhiva's simple marital love, Pahari Ramani Lakshma's unmatched affection for Mahadevi - Emotions, the genius and swami-bhakti of old devotion, the compassionate-touching life story of a Chinese young man, Parvatya Kuli Jangbahadur and his Anuj Coriander Mtta etc
 ranked sketches on a variety of subjects
 sabhi smriti-chitron ko mahadevi ne apane jivan ke bheetar se prastut kiya he, atah yah swaabhaavik hi he ki inamen unke apane jivan kii vividh ghatnaon evam unke charitra ke vibhinn anshon ko sthaan praapt hua he
 He has recorded his feelings as accurately as possible
 yahan yah ullekhneey he ki mahadevi ke rekhachitron main charitra-chithran kaa tatv pramukh rahaa he, kathanak uskaa angeebhoot hokar prakat hua he
 There is also enough inclusion of serious folk in these drawings
 'path ke saathi' main mahadevi ne apane samakaleen rachanakaaron kaa chithran kiya he
 The respect and intimate manner in which he has established the life-philosophy and temperamental greatness of these litterateurs is a great achievement in itself
 'path ke saathi' main sansmaran bhi hai or mahadevi dwaara padhe gaye kaviyon ke jivan prishth bhi
 He has made poetic mention of the closeness, intimacy and influence of litterateurs on the one hand and on the other hand, has tried to test his overall philosophy of life
 'path ke saathi' main kavindra rabindra, dadda, prasad, niraala, pant, subhadrakumari chouhan tathaa siyaaramsharan gupt kii rekhaayen shabd-chitra ke rup main ain hai
 The series 'links' comprise her reflective essays written in relation to social problems, especially the burning questions of the battered woman's life
 rachanaatmak gadhy ke atirikt 'mahadevi kaa vivechanaatmak gadhy' tathaa 'deepashikha', 'vama' or 'aadhunik kavi- mahadevi' kii bhoomikaaon main unki aalochanatmak pratibha ko aasaani se mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he

 durbhiti yaa phobia ek prakaar kaa manovikar he jisamen vyakti ko vishesh vastuon, paristhitiyon yaa kriyaaon se dar lagane lagata he
 That is, there is panic in their presence when those things are not dangerous at that time
 yah ek prakaar kii chintaa kii beemaari he
 In this disease, a person suffering from mild heartburn can have frightening seizures
 durbhiti kii sthiti main vyakti kaa dhyaan kuch ek lakshanon par kendrit ho saktaa he, jaise-dil kaa jor-jor se dhadkna yaa behoshee laganaa
 There are some fears associated with these symptoms like fear of dying, fear of losing control over yourself or going crazy
 is vikaar se rogi adhiktar log apane vikaar par pardaa daale rahete hai
 They think that discussing it will make them laugh
 ve un halaat se bachane kii purajor koshish karte hai jinase unhen phobia kaa daura padataa he
 But this escape attitude dissolves poison in life
 iske baad psycotherapist kii sahaayta se man main baithe phobia ko mitaane kii koshish kii ja sakati he
 In this, measures are suggested to control the apprehension arising in the mind when faced with a phobia-inducing situation
 jaise-jaise rogi kaa aatmavishvaas lautataa jaataa he, vaise-vaise uskaa bhay ghatata jaataa he
 This desensitization therapy causes the patient to live again

 To overcome the fear of speaking in a gathering like social phobia, the situation can be brought under control by overcoming internal anxiety and tension
 beta-bloker davaayen jaise proprenolol or aetenolol or chintanivarak davaayen jaise alprejolom bhi soshal phobia se ubaarane main prabhavi sabit hoti hai
 How is phobia disease different from other fears? Its biggest feature is that the person's anxiety, nervousness and discomfort are not reduced even knowing that the same situation is not dangerous for other people
 yah dar saamne dikhne vaale khatre se bahut zyada hote hai
 The person realizes that his fear has no logical basis, yet he is not able to control it
 is kaaran uski pareshaani or bad jaati he
 Due to this fear, the person tries to run away from those things, people and situations so that they do not have to face that dreadful situation
 dhire-dhire yah dar itnaa bad jaataa he ki vyakti har samay usee ke bare main sochataa rahata he or darataa he ki kahin uskaa saamana na ho jaae
 Due to this, there is a lot of difficulty in his work and normal life
 iske mukhyatah teen prakaar hote he- a person suffering from agoraphobia is nervous about going out of the house, walking to shops or theaters, going to crowds, traveling alone in a train, or going to public places
 yani aisi jagah se jahaan se nikalnaa aasaan na ho, vyakti ko ghabrahat hoti he or usase bachane kaa prayaas karata he
 In social misfortune, it is difficult to talk about any social situation such as speaking or writing in front of people, giving a speech on stage, listening to the telephone, talking to people in a high position
 vishesh phobia main kisi khaas cheez yaa sthiti main dar lagata he
 Fear of altitude, fear of water, oil pelt, fear of cats, dogs, insects etc
 bahut se logon ko dar hota he ki wo bheed main behosh hokar gir jaayenge
 It is found more in puberty and women
 iske kaaran kuch mukhya manovaigyanik kaaran nimnlikhit hai- One of the main reasons for this is considered conditioning
 iskaa matlab he ki yadi kisi saamaanya paristhiti main vyakti ke saath kuch durghatana ghat jaati he to us ghatana ke ghatane ke baad agali baar koi khatra na hone par bhi vyakti ko un paristhitiyon main punah ghabrahat hoti he
 Studies have found that if mothers have this disease, then it is very likely to be found in children because children learn those symptoms
 aatmavishvaas kii kami or aalochana kaa dar bhi kai baar is rog ko janm dete he
 Apart from this, it can also be due to biological or genetic reasons
 iske ilaaj ke liye vibhinn prakaar kii aushadhiyaan uplabdh he jo kaaphi prabhavi he
 However, psychological therapy methods have also been found to be very necessary and beneficial for this
 yahan dhyaan dene kii baat he ki iskaa ilaaj swayan dawaai lekar nahi karnaa chahie kyonki isse samasya bad sakati he

 Most of the bugs are caused by mistakes and errors made by people in the source code of a program or in its design, and some are caused by compilers that create incorrect code
 ek aisa program jisamen badi sankhya main bag paae jate hai or / yaa jo bag isaki kaaryakshmata par buree tarah hastkshep karte hai, unhen buggi kaha jaataa he
 Reports detailing bugs in a program are commonly known as bug reports, fault reports, problem reports, trouble reports, change requests, and the like

 Perhaps someone can inadvertently create an off-by-one error when converting imaginary design to the chosen programming language and thus fail to decorate the last word in the list
 ant main, iske parinaam swaroop bane program ko computer main tip karte samay vah galati se ek '' hona chahie, jiskaa nateeja sambhawatah shabdon ko vipareet varnmaala kram main sajaane ke rup main saamne aa saktaa he
 More complex bugs can arise from unintended contact between different parts of a computer program
 aisa aksar hota he kyonki computer program jatil ho sakate hai--kuch maamalon main lakhon kii sankhya main lambii line ho sakati hai--jinhen aksar ek kaaphi lambey samay main kai logon dwaara program kiya gaya ho saktaa he, isliye aise programmer maansik rup se har sambhav tareeke kaa pataa lagane main asamarth hote hai ki koun ke bhaag sampark kar sakate hai
 Another category of bugs called the race condition occurs either when a process is running in more than one thread or in two or more processes simultaneously and when the correct sequence of execution of critical sequences of code is correct Is not synchronized in a manner
 software udyog ne software lekhan karte hue anjaane main bag ko shaamil kiye jane se programmeron ko bachaane ke tareeke khojane main kaaphi prayaas kiya he
 These include: bag kaa pataa lagaana or use hataanaa yaa "dibging" aksar computer programing kaa ek mahatvapurn bhaag hota he
 An early computer expert, Maurice Wilkes, noted in one of his experiences in the 1940s that much of the rest of his life would be spent investigating the mistakes of his own programs
 As computer programs become more complex, bugs become more common and difficult to remove
 aksar programmer nae code likhane kii tulana main bagon kaa pataa lagane or unhen dur karne main zyada samay lagaate hai or kahin adhik prayaas karte hai
 Software testers are professionals whose main task is to detect bugs or write code that supports testing
 kuch projecton main program viksit karne kii tulana main zyada sansaadhan pareekshan main kharch kiye ja sakate hai
 Generally the most difficult part of debugging is to detect bugs in the source code
 ek baar jab iskaa pataa lag jaataa he to ise thik karnaa aam taur par apekshaakrit aasaan hota he
 There are also programs known as debuggers that help programmers detect bugs by implementing code one by one, monitoring variable values, and other features that understand the behavior of the program
 ek dibgar ke bina program ke karyanvayan kaa pataa lagane yaa maanon ko dikhaane ke liye code ko is tarah joda ja saktaa he ki sandeshon yaa maanon ko ek consol main programing kii bhashaa main printf) ke saath) yaa ek windo main yaa log fil main likhaa ja sake
 However, bug detection is also somewhat of an art with the help of a debugger
 kisi program ke ek section main maujuud kisi bag ke liye ek puri tarah se duusare section main vifaltaa kaa kaaran bananaa asaamaanya nahin he jiske kaaran system ke ek spashtatah asambaddha bhaag main iskaa pataa lagaana vishesh rup se mushkil ho jaataa he
 Sometimes the bug is not a separate defect but rather represents an error of thinking or planning on the part of the programmer
 is tarah kii taarkik trutiyon ke liye program ke us bhaag kii sampurna marammat yaa uske dubaara lekhan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 As part of a code review, if it is shown that some faulty logic exists in its implementation, these errors can often be detected without reproducing any such bugs using a particular type of code
 lekin kahin adhik vishesh rup se kisi bag kaa pataa lagane main pehla charan he ise vishwasaneey tareeke se punah prastut karnaa
 Once the bug has been reintroduced, the programmer can use a debugger or any other tool to monitor the implementation of the program in the defective region and locate the location in which the program deviates from its intended purpose
 has gone
 bag ko punah prastut karnaa aksar aasaan nahin hota he
 Some bugs are caused by program inputs that can be difficult for programmers to reproduce
 thirac-25 vikiran mashin se hui mauton kaa ek kaaran ek bag tha jo keval us samay utpann hua tha jab mashin sanchaalak ne ek upachaar yojana kii pravishti bahut adhik teji se kar di; is kaary ke liye sakasham hone main kai dinon kaa abhyaas karnaa padaa tha, isliye bag pareekshan ke dauraan yaa us samay utpann nahin hua tha jab nirmaataa ne isaki nakal karne kii koshish kii thi
 Other bugs may disappear by running the program through a debugger; These are Heisenbugs
 dibging abhi bhi ek ubaau kaary he jiske liye kaaphi prayaas kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Since the 1990s, there has been renewed interest in developing effective automated collaboration in debugging, especially since the Ariane 5 Flight 501 crash

 As with any creative work, sometimes even a spark of inspiration shows a solution, but this is rare and, by definition, cannot be relied upon
 bag ke liye kakshaen bhi yojit kii jaati hai jinka swayan code se koi matlab nahin hota he
 For example, if one is dependent on a faulty documentation or hardware, the code can be written completely correctly as the documentation says but but the bug actually resides in the documentation or hardware, not the code
 haalanki, system ke anya bhaagon kii bajaay code ko badalanaa aam he, kyonki ise badalane main samay or laagat aam taur par kam lagata he
 There are often workarounds for hardware bugs in contiguous systems, as it is far cheaper to produce a new version of ROM than to rebuild hardware, especially if these are commodity items
 aise gyaat bagon ke saath software kaa jari kiya janaa ek aam baat he jo gaiyr-mahatvapurn maane jate hai arthath jo utpaada ke saath zyaadaatar upyogkartaaon ke mukhya anubhav ko prabhavit nahin karte hai
 Since by definition any number of unknown bugs can exist in software products, an estimate of the number of potential bugs left over from the measurement can be obtained during testing; The longer the product is tested or developed, the more reliable it becomes
 Most large software projects have two lists of "known bugs" - one that the software team is aware of and the other about which users are told
 yah tathyon kaa chipaaya janaa nahin he balki upyogkarta utpaada ke aantarik karypranali par dhyaan nahin dete hai
 The second list gives users information about bugs that have not been resolved in the current release or at all, and a workaround may also be offered
 bagon ko dur nahin kiye jane ke kai kaaran hote hai: Given the above, writing a completely bug-free software with no real complexity is often considered impossible
 is prakaar bagon ko inaki gambhirtha ke aadhaar par vargeekrut kiya jaataa he or kam-tivrata vaale gaiyr-gambhir bagon ko bardaasht kar liya jaataa he kyonki ve adhikansh upyogkartaaon ke liye system ke samuchit sanchaalan ko prabhavit nahin karte hai
 nasa's SATC was successful in reducing the number of errors to less than 0
1 per 1000 lines of code, but this was not considered feasible for any real-world project
