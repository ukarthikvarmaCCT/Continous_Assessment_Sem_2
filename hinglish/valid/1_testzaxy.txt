 Shanti mantras are the mantras of the Vedas that pray for peace
 praaia: hinduon ke dharmik krityon ke armbh or ant main inkaa paath kiya jaataa he
 Shanti Mantras are found in Upanishads, where they are invoked in the beginning of some topics of Upanishads
 They are supposed to calm the mind of reciter and environment around him / her
 Reciting them is also believed to be removing any obstacles for the task being started
 Shanti Mantras always end with three utterances of word "shanti" which means "peace"
 The Reason for uttering three times is for calming and removing obstacles inthree realms which are: "physical" or physics, "divine" or adhidaivik and "internal" or spiritual According to the scriptures of Hinduism sources of obstacles and troubles are in these three realms
 Physical or adhi-bhautika realm can be source of troubles / obstacles coming from external world, such as from wild animals, people, natural calamities etc
 Divine or adhi-daivika realm can be source of troubles / obstacles coming fromextra-sensory world of spirits, ghosts, deities, demigods / angels etc
 Internal or Adhyaatmika realm is source of troubles / obstacles arising out of ones own body and mind, such as pain, diseases, laziness, absent-mindedness etc
 These are called "tapa-traya" or three classes of troubles
when Shanti mantras are recited, obstacles from these realms are believed to bepacified

 This epic is a mixture of art and science, being a mixture of two great traditions of Sanskrit literature - Ramayana and Paninian grammar

 While expressing pride of his own work, Bhatti has said that this composition is not for the readers inferior to the knowledge of grammar

 It is designed to entertain the meritorious scholar, and to make the Subodh student aware of the rigorous rules of grammar in practical method
 bhattikavy kii praudhata ne use kathin hote hue bhi janpriya evam maanya banaaya he
 In the tradition of ancient reading, Bhattikavya is given the same place as the famous Panchamahakaavya

 In Madhyaviyathatuvrati, there is a mention of the commentary on Bhattikavya by Adi Shankara

 There are four episodes in the epic
 kathabhag ke upkathan kii drushti se yah mahakavy 22 sargo main vibhajit he tathaa mahakavy ke sakal lakshanon se samanvit he
 The main purpose of the composition is to present the characteristics of grammar and literature by the target

 a scandal in the middle is characterized by certain organs of poetry
 rachana kaa anukram is prakaar he ki pratham cond vyakarnanusaari vividh shabdarupon ko prakeern rup se sangruhit karata he
 The second scandal is the 'rights scandal', in which word usage is in accordance with the rules displayed in certain specific rights of Paninian grammar
 tritiy cond saahitiyik visheshtaon ko abhilakshith karne kii drushti se rachaa gaya he atev is cond ko mahakavi ne 'prasancand' kii sangya di he
 There are four tribunals in this scandal: The first tribunal has the goals of linguistic and semantic
 dwitiya adhikaran main maadhurya gun ke swaroop kaa pradarshan lakshya dwaara kiya gaya he, tritiy adhikaran main bhaviktv kaa swaroop pradarshan karte hue kathanak ke prasanganusaar raajnneeti ke vividh tatwon evam upayon par prakaash daalaa gaya he
 The fourth tribunal of the Prasanna Kand is a special form of this epic
 isamen aise padyon kii rachana kii gai he jinamein sanskrit tathaa praakrit bhashaa kaa samanaantar samavesh he, vahi padya sanskrit main upanibaddh he jisaki padaavalee praakrit padya kaa bhi yathavat swaroop liye he or donon bhashaa main pratipaadya arth ek hi he
 This part is a personal feature of Bhattikavya, presenting an example of language language

 This scandal is the biggest

 The second episode covers the next four sergoes, describing the coronation of Sugriva's coronation, the discovery of Sita by the monkey Bhatas, the dissolution of the Ashokavatika on his return, and the capture of Maruti and present in the assembly
 tisare, prasancand main agle chaar sarg hai jinamein sita ke abhigyaan kaa pradarshan, lanka main prabhaat kaa varnan, vibhishana kaa ram ke paas aagaman tathaa sethubandh kii katha he
 The last, the third incident takes the next nine cantos, in which the story is told till the return of King Ramachandra to Ayodhya by attaching the sherbandha
 chaaron cond or 22 sargo main 1625 padya hai, jinamein pratham padya mangalacharan vastunirdeshaatmak he tathaa antim padya kavyopsanhaar kaa he

 Apart from these, there is a small use of Prahrishini, Malini, Aupachandasik, Dynastha, Vitaliya, Ashwalalit, Nandan, Prithvi, Ruchira, Narkutak, Tanumadhya, Trotak, Dritavilibad, Pramitakshara, Prahranakalika, Mandakranta, Shardulwikrit and Srabdhara

 According to the prophet himself, Bhattikavya was composed in Balabhi Nagar under the Gurjar country
 bhatti kavi kaa naam "bhartri" shabd kaa apbhransh rup he
 Certain reviewers consider the poet's full name as Bhartrihari, but this Bhartrihari is certainly different from Bhatruhari, the creator of the Shatatraya or the principal of the syntactic
 bhatti upnaam bhartruhari kavi valbhinaresh shridhar sen se sambandhit he
 The time of Mahakavi Bhatti is unanimous in the late sixth century AD
 alankaar varg main nidarshit udaahranon se spasht prathit hota he ki bhatti or bhamah ek hi parampara ke anuyaayi hai
 For nearly 10 centuries before Bhattikavya's composition, Panini's Ashtadhyayi's deep reading was going on

 He did this by associating the examples given in the grammar texts already existing with the Ramakatha

 The influence of Bhattikavya can be seen even in remote Java

 isamen elice naam kii ek ladki kii kahani he jo ek khargosh kii maand main girakar, ajeeb or maanav-sadrush jeevon kii aabaadi vaale ek kalpana lok main pahunch jaati he
 The story is full of hints of Dodgson's friends
 is kahani ne tark ko jis tareeke se pesh kiya he usne is kahani ko vayaskon ke saath-saath bacchon ke bich bhi sthaayee lokapriyata di
 It is considered one of the best examples of the "literary nonsense" genre, and its narrative path and structure have been quite influential, especially in the fantasy genre
 elice ko us ghatana ke thik teen saal baad 1865 main likhaa gaya tha, jab reverend charles lutwig dodson or reverend robinsan dakworth ne, teen choti ladakiyon ke saath thames nadi main ek naav par saiyr kii: Those three girls were the daughters of the Chancellor of the University of Oxford and Dean of Christ Church as well as the Headmaster of Westminster School, Henry George Liddell
 kitaab kaa adhikansh romaanch, oxford or christ carch ke logon, paristhitiyon or imaaraton par aadhaarit or usase prabhavit he, jaise "rabit hole" jo christ carch ke mukhya haul ke peeche kii vaastavik sidhiyon kaa dyotak he
 It is believed that at Ripon Cathedral, where Carroll's father was a canon, a carving of the griffon and rabbit provided inspiration for the story
 yah safar, oxford ke nikat fauli brij par shuru hua tha or paanch mile dur godsto ke gaanv main samaapt hua
 To spend time, Reverend Dodgson told the girls a story, which, not coincidentally, involves a high-minded girl named Alice who sets off in search of adventure
 ladakiyon ko yah pasand aayaa or elice lidele ne dodson se use uske liye likhane ke liye kaha
 ek lambii deree ke baad - do saal se adhik - unhone antat aisa kiya or 26 navambar 1864 ko elice ko alises adventures under ground kii hastlikhit pandulipi di, jisamen khud dodson ke banaae chitra the
 Martin Gardner, including some, suspects that there was also an earlier version that was later destroyed by Dodgson himself, when he printed a more detailed copy by hand, but there is no known evidence to support it at first sight
 lekin elice ke apni prati praapt karne se pehle hi, dodson iske prakaashan or 15,500 shabdon kii mul kahani ko 27,500 shabdon main vistrut karne kii taiyaari kar rahe the, sabase ullekhneey rup se cheshair cat or mad tii-party ke bare main kadiyon ko jodne se sambadhit

 The first publication of 2,000 was halted because Tenniel objected to print quality

 jivit rajhanson ko mugdar kii tarah istemaal kiya ja rahaa tha or hejahogon ko gend banaaya gaya tha or elice kii mulaakaat ek baar phir cheshair cat se ho gayi

 The Queen of Hearts is commonly mistaken for being considered the Red Queen of the sequel to the story, Through the looking-glass, but has no other characteristics than being a queen
 queen of hearts, card pariklpana ke deck kaa ek hissaa he jo pehali pustak main maujuud he, jabaki red queen ek shatranj ke laal tukade kaa pratinidhitiv karti he, chunki shatranj hi agali kadi kaa vishay he
 Due to the mixing of the characters in several adaptations, confusion has arisen

 Of course, Alice Leedel was herself in it, while Carol, or Charles Dodgson, is also copied as the dodo

 a portrait of Tenniel's Through the looking-glass depicts a character referred to as "man in white paper", as a cartoon of Disraeli wearing a paper cap
 The lion and unicorn paintings are also strikingly similar to Tanniel's Gladstone and Disraeli's punch paintings
 hatter ke theophilis carter, ek furniture vikreta jo apane aparamparaagat avishkaar ke liye oxford main janaa jaataa tha, se sambandhit hone kii kaaphi sambhaavna he

 The title, "wonderland", has entered the language and refers to a spectacular fantasy place, or a real-world place with dreamlike features
 This, like other works of "alice", is widely referred to in popular culture
 "down da rabit-hole", "adhyay 1" kaa sheershak, agyaat main ek romaanchakaari yatra par jane ke liye ek lokapriy shabd ban gaya he
 In drug culture, "going down the rabbit-hole" is a metaphor for claiming hallucinations, as Carroll's novel appears to be similar to a drug trip
 "'adhyay 6"' main, cheshair billi kaa gaayab hona, elice ko apni sabase yaadgaar pankti kehane ke liye prerit karata he:"

 Of course, the most famous utterance was spoken when the Queen of Hearts shouted "off with every head!" On alice Perhaps Carroll here imprinted a scene from Shakespeare "richard III" when Richard yells "of with his head!", Demanding Lord Hastings' death sentence
 When Alice began to grow tall after eating a cake with the words "eat Me", she says "kurioser and kurioser", a famous line still used today to describe an event with extraordinary surprise
 cheshair cat elice ko pushti detii he "ham sab yahaan pagal hai", ek line jise parinamswaroop kai varshon tak doharaaya gaya
 == Symbolism in the Text == === Mathematics === Since Carroll was a mathematician Christ Church, it was suggested: Citing the book Template: News citing the fact that both this story and "through the Looking Glass" Has many reference and mathematical concepts; Examples include: * In chapter 1, "under the rabbit's den", in the midst of shrinking, Ellis philosophically thinks of her final shape, perhaps "flipping out completely like a candle," "; This idea reflects the concept of boundary
 * adhyay 2 main, "aansu kaa talab" elice guna karne kii koshish karti he lekin kuch ajeeb parinaam nikaalati he:""mujhe dekhne do: chaar baar paanch baarah he or chaar baar chah teraa he or chaar baar saat, oh priy! main is dar se kabhi bees tak nahin pahunch paaungi!"" isse sankhya ke pratinidhitiv kii padtaal kii gai he jiske liye upyog kiya gaya vibhinn aadhaar or sthetiya ank pranali 
 * adhyay 5 main, "caterpillar kii salaah", kabutar kahata he ki choti ladkiyaan saanp kii tarah hai, kyonki choti ladkiyaan or saanp, donon hi andey khate hai
 This common notion of abstraction is widespread in many fields of science, an example of this argument being adopted in mathematics is the substitution of variables
 * adhyay 7 main, "ek pagal chaay party", march hair, mad hatter or dormause, kai udhaaharan dete hai jisamen ek vaakya "A" kaa arth mulya kanvars ke "A" ke baraabar nahin he ; tarkshastra or ganit main, yah ek vyutkram sambandh kii charchaa karnaa he
 * Also in Chapter 7, Ellis ponders what this means when changing seats around the round table makes them initially fall behind
 yah purnank modulo n ke ring par yoga kaa ek nirikshan he
 * The Cheshire Cat fades away until she disappears completely, leaving only her wide laugh, which remains in the air, to Alice's surprise and she says that she smiled a cat without smiling
 Not seen, but never a grin without a cat
 avadharanaon pruthakkaran jab dodson likh rahe the, us vakt ganit par haaavee ho rahaa tha
 Dodgson's depiction of the relationship between cat and grin can be understood as a representation of the basic concept of mathematics and number
 udhaaharan ke liye, do yaa teen seb par vichaar karne ke bajaay koi vyakti aasaani se 'seb' kii avadharana par vichaar kar saktaa he jis par 'do' or 'teen' kii avadharanaen nirbhar lagati hai
 However, a more sophisticated leap is to consider the concept of 'two' and 'three' by themselves, quite like a grin, radically dependent on the cat, conceptually different from its physical goal
 === french bhashaa === kai logon ne yah suzav diya he, martin gardenar or selvin gudekar sahit ki dodson kii french bhashaa main ruchi thi, jinhone kahani main iske bare main sandarbh or shlesh prastut kiye hai
 It is quite likely that they refer to French education, which was part of a Victorian period raising middle-class girls
 udhaaharan ke liye, duusare adhyay main, elice maanati he ki mouse zarur french hoga or usase apane french pustak ke paath kaa pehla vaakya bolti he: "où est ma chatte?" 
 henry beau ke french anuwaad main, elice maanati he ki mouse zarur italvi he or usase italvi main bolti he
 === Classical Languages === In the second chapter, Ellis initially addresses the mouse as "O mouse", the Declaration book based on the noun's own vague memory: "a rat - of a rat - for a rat - a mouse - o Mice! " This corresponds to the traditional order that Byzantine grammarians established for the five distinctions of classical Greek; Due to the lack of Panchami inflection, which is not found in Greek but is found in Latin, the reference is apparently not from the latter as some believe
 === aitihaasik sandarbh === aathven adhyay main, teen card, gulab vriksh par laal gulab chitrakaari kar rahe hai, kyonki unhone galati se ek safed gulab kaa ped laga diya jo queen of hearts ko pasand nahin he

 Additionally, his lyrical Vita Nyuova, meaning New Life, is a collection of poignant poems, in which he recounts the love story of his beloved Sitrice and the poignant viraha tale on his death in 23 years
 inkaa janm europe main, italy main hua tha
 They were citizens of Florence

 He was born at a time when a revival of medieval ideology and culture was beginning
 raajnneeti ke vichaaron or kala sambandhi manyataon main bhi parivartan ho rahaa tha
 Dante is considered the best poet of Italy, in relation to which the English poet Shelley has said that, dante kaa kavy us sethu ke samaan he jo kaal kii dhara par bana he or pracheen vishwa ko aadhunik vishwa se milaataa he
 Dante wrote his epic in simple colloquial Italian language, not writing in Latin language, and made his mother tongue and popular language proud with his great works

 Dante was not only a poet and thinker, he was also a political leader and administrator
 unhone florence rajya par shashan bhi kiya
 But his art and poetry ideas are found in his work De Vulgari Eloquyo
 ve utkrisht kavita se hi santusht naa hokar yah bhi bataate hai, ki sarvotkrisht kavita kin baton par nirbhar karti he
 He made a revolutionary effort against Greek and Latin traditions by giving subjects like love and folklore the importance of his works
 dante ke vichaar se parishthit saushthavpurn bhashaa, uttam abhivyanjana style tathaa upyukt vishaywastu kaa saamanjasy hone par hi shreshth rachana sambhav ho sakati he
 In this way, Dante has composed his poetry by choosing the best words from the lingua franca and also from the figurative language, except for the words Bhadde and Rustic for best composition
 de valgari elocuo granth kii jorge centsbari ne bhuri-bhuri prashansa kii he
 After Dante, in Italy, such an important poetry thinker did not occur before Croche
 aaligyari daante kii greek tathaa laathini sahitya ke sivaa dharmavigyaan main bhi uski vishesh ruchi thi
 In politics, he was a follower and supporter of the soft party, but when its side was defeated by the revolutionary party of Guelph in 1301, Dante and his comrades had to bear the penalty of exile
 is sajaa ke baad durbhaagya se yadi vah florentine sarkaar ke haath pakad liya jaataa to uske jivit jala die jane tak kii sambhaavna thi
 From this time till death, he wandered from one place to another and from third to third like a pilgrim or almost like a beggar
 in dinon uski sthiti patavarviheen nauka kii tarah ho gai thi
 Stumbling rate upon rate, he experienced with great bitterness how tasteless the bread of another's house was and how much pain he felt in climbing the stairs of a foreign house

 He turned it down and decided to live on his way to the end
 san 1321 main ravenna main uski mrityu hui or vahiin vah dafnaaya gaya
 Ravenna officials are still unwilling to return her body to her native land, who had treated her with such scorn
 daante ke jivan ke saath do striyon ke naam ghanishtha rup se sambanddh hai
 One is Biatris Portinari and the other is Gemya Donati
 pehali uski yuvavastha kii preyasi thi jise usne us sam dekha tha jab vah keval nau varsh kii thi
 Even after Biatrice married Simon de Bardy and died within a short time in 1290, the teeth remained in his affection
 duusari mahila, jemya, uski vivaahita patni thi jiske saath uskaa vivaah san 1277 main hua tha
 She did not support Teeth when he was exiled
 spasht he ki daante uske vyavhaar or rang dhang se santusht na tha or baad main sambhavat: usase ghrinaa bhi karne laga tha
 For the convenience of tooth creations, we can divide it into three parts or periods
 pratham bhaag main ve kritiyaan rakhi ja sakati hai jinamein yauvan kaa utsaah or biatris ke prati uske utkar anuraag kaa dharmik roopantaran drushtigochar hota he
 Its duration can be roughly considered from 1283 to 1290
 is kaal kii sabase mukhya rachana vita nuova he
 The second part begins after the death of Viratris
 iskaa vistaar 1291 se 1313 tak rakhaa ja saktaa he
 During this period, his life was temporarily dominated by despair, sorrow and faith, and his inclination became more and more towards philosophy and science
 vah raajnneetik jhagadon kii katutaa main ek daanv pechon yaa yojanaon main lipt hota gaya
 The main compositions of this period are The Convivio, The Monarchia, The Epicles etc
 samrat henry saptam se daante ne badi badi aashaaq band rakhi thi jinpar uski mrityu ne pani pher diya
 All his plans ended abruptly, but the reward was that he could not defeat him completely
 usne ek baar phir aadhyatmik santulan kii ore kadam badhaayaa
 The ideas and beliefs of youth resurfaced in him and he became even more strongly oriented towards the worship of the Holy Spirit of the late Biatris
 'divine kamedi' kii kitni hi kavitaaon main iske pramaan bikhare pade hai
 This third period of tooth creations can be considered from 1314 to 1321, till the time of his death
 'di vita nuova' ko ham italy ke pratham premakavy kii sangya de sakate hai
 In this, we get a glimpse of the psychological analysis of the said feelings of the poet
 biatris ke pratham darshan ke baad hi kis tarah uske nae jivan kaa aarambh hua, uske hriday main kis tarah kram kram se is nari ke saundarya evam maadhurya kii bhaavana prabalatar haati gai, dhire dhire vah kis tarah uski aashaaon tathaa prem-bhakthi-upasna kaa centre banati gai, usee mrityu par use kitni maansik vednaa or akulata hui or kis prakaar uskaa parthiv prem ant main divya bhakthi ev poojabhaav main parinat hota gaya, isaki manoram jhaanki is kavy main dekhi ja sakati he
 After the death of Biatris, his attention shifted to the idyllic feelings, thoughts and selfishness for a few years, and he began to eat in the midst of disappointments or doubts
 yah ham uski duusari rachana 'conbivon' main dekh sakate hai
 In both these compositions, where and when Biotrice appears to be a statue of a supernatural beauty, and where it looks like a divine shadow from a philosophical or religious point of view, it is unnecessary to discuss it
 itnaa hi kahana alam hoga ki 'vita nuova' saamaanya premgautha na hokar ek ucch satviktaa ev shraddha kii ore kavi kaa maansik unnayan he
 There is no doubt that despite the many contradictions of hope despair, the heart of the tooth seems to be conscious of its recurrence
 vastut: kavy ke antim bhaag se hi abhas milane lagata he ki kavi ke maanas chakshu par us parloukik jagat kii chaaya padani aarambh ho chuki thi jiskaa centrebindu biatris hi thi or jiskaa paripaak uske 'divine kamedi' naamak kavy main hua
 Among the Latina compositions of teeth, 'de Monarchia' is particularly notable
 isamen dikhalaayaa gaya he ki samrajya kii aavashyakt ek tarah se ishvarsamarthit he
 They depict the separate territories of state and church or religious institution and emphasize that the power of the Pope should be confined to religious matters only
 use patrasangrah 'ipicills' main se bhi kai patron main isi aashay ke vichaar prakat kiye gaye hai
 There was a lot of criticism in the opposition in favor of Dante, whose fame was sometimes seen as being smeared
 phir bhi isamen andeh nahin ki vah mahaan kavi tha jisane apane parvarti anek kaviyon tathaa sahityakaron ko vyapak rup se prabhavit kiya
 With the passage of time, many scholars and thinkers have praised him very much, which helps in giving him a very high place among the writers and poets of the world today
