 Political economics, giving information about the division of political and economic power in a society, describes how this distribution of power is having an effect on the developmental and other policies
 isi baat ko is tarah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki raajnneetik arthshaastra un buddhisangat faisalon kaa adhyayan karata he jo raajnneetik or aarthik sansthaaon ke sandarbh main liye jate hai
 In this study, macro-effects are considered in the light of rational grounds
 multah utpaadan evam vyapaar, tathaa inkaa vidhi, pratha, sarkaar se sambandh or rashtriya aay evam smapda ke vitaran ke adhyayan ko 'raajnneetik arthshaastra' kaha gaya tha
 Political economics originated from moral philosophy
 attharahavin shatabdi main iskaa vikaas rajya ke arthtantr yaa polity ke adhyayan ke uddeshy se kiya gaya tha, isi liye iskaa naam 'political economi' padaa
 The discipline of economics in the long run from Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations published in the mid-eighteenth century to John Stuart Mill's Principles of Political Economy and Karl Marx's 'capital: a Critique of Political Economy' published in the nineteenth century It was mainly known as 'political economics'
 darasal, samaaj-vaigyanikon kii manyata thi ki raajnneetik kaarak aarthik parinaamon par anivaary hi nahin balki nirnayakari prabhaav daalate hai
 In the twentieth century, the disciplines of political science and economics continued to separate
 nioclasical arthshaastra ke prabhaav main arthshaastra kii paddatiyaan raajnneeti se apekshaakrit swytt ho kar viksit huin or arthshaastriyon kaa jor upabhoktaaon or companiyon ke upar padane vaale sarkari niyantranon or bazaar ke vikaas kii paristhitiyon par hota chalaa gaya
 For the past few decades, once again talks of the nexus of politics and economics have started happening and the discussion of new political economics has started to be heard
 raajnneetik arthshaastra kaa is naye ubhaar main khaas baat yah he ki yah raajnneeti ke aarthik mahatva ko rekhaankit karne ke liye aadhunik arthshaastra kii parishkrut vishleshnatmak paddatiyon kaa istemaal karata he
 According to historians of economic science, the term political economy was first used in 1615 by Moncretin de Vatville
 frans kaa yah vanikwaadi vidwaan chahta tha ki aarthik vigyaan kii paribhaasha ko un simaaon se baahar nikaala jaae jinamein unani chintakon ne use simit kar diya he
 According to the ancient Greeks, the field of economics was limited to household expenses
 monkretin ne is vichaar main rajya kii sanstha ke ird-gird hone vaale chintan yani raajnneeti ko bhi jod diya
 In 1761 Sir James Stuart was the first English economist to refer to the term in the title of his book 'an Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy'
 adam smith kaa vichaar tha ki raajnneetik arthshaastra kaa kaam janata ko jeevanyaapan ke liye paryaapt aamadani uplabdh karaane kii praavdhaan karnaa he or duusari ore sarkaar ke liye itane rajasav kaa intazaam karnaa he jisase saarvajanik uddeshyon kii purti ho sake
 Karl Marx did the work of giving political economics a broader meaning out of the scope of the definition given by Smith
 unke samakaleen je
es
 mil kii dilchaspee poonjeewaad kii aalochana main nahin thi, lekin unhone mulya, vyapaar, dhan, aabaadi, vetan, aarthik pranali or aarthik niti ke sandarbh main raajnneetik arthshaastra kii vyakhya kii
 But Marx assumed from British political economics that economic exchange can be equitable only when the labor-price imposed by both parties is equal
 lekin, jab ek paksh shram kareedne vaala or doosraa shram bechney vaala hota he to shram kareedne vaala hameshaa hi kisi bhi vinimay main bahut zyaada laabh hasil kar letaa he
 On the basis of this benefit, the capital keeps accumulating progressively with him
 is poonji sanchay ke gahan or doorgaami aarthik-saamaajik falitarth hote hai or iske garbh se prabhutv va adhinsthata kii samjik sanrachanaayen janm leti hai
 Indeed, Aristotle had raised the problem of the confusion Marx was suggesting in his Nicomacian Ethics
 arestu ke is vimarsh main aadhunik raajnneetik arthshaastra ke beej nihit the
 Aristotle said that when two people exchange any two things, one of them is better and one is less
 aise main donon main se kisi ek paksh ko duusare ke mukaable adhik laabh hona laazmi he
 His question was how to equalize the benefits of both, as the inequality of benefits could lead to a heterogeneous society
 arestu ke paas is samasya kaa hal nahin tha
 Marx's era was the era of development of nations, so he concluded that capitalism goes on accumulating wealth on a large scale and reached a point and plays a major role in the development of the nation
 lenin ne marks ke isi vichaar kaa vistaar karte hue dikhaaya ki kis tarah upniveshwaad or samrajyavad ke zariye poonjeewaad apana antarrashtriya vistaar karata he
 By taking advantage of the discussions of Marx and Lenin, economists were able to formulate many kinds of radical assumptions
 unhone yojanapurvak raajnneeti or arthshaastra ko aapas main mila diya, poonjeewaad kii prakruti or raajnneetik dalon ke iraadon kii jaanch kii
 In this context, public production, external influences and monopolies were analyzed
 alag-alag sarkaron dwaara sansadhano kaa bantwaaraa karne kii prakriya kii bhi vyakhya kii gayi
 The leftist aspects of political economics played a major role in the formulation of the concept of a philanthropic state
 pachaas ke dashak main richard em
 titumus ne europe kii zamin par lokopkaaree rajya ko teen modelon main baant kar dekha
 He pointed out that anglo-saxon countries adopt politics of public favor only when the market fails
 yah aanshik kism kaa lok upkaar he
 In countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, the politics of public favor is mixed in economics to improve industrial achievements
 scandivenian deshon main sansthagat punarvitaramkaari model kii tarah lok upkaar kii raajnneeti kii jaati he
 Recently, the philanthropic state has also been interpreted as welfare capitalism
 da thri varlds of welfare capitalizam main gosta asping-anderson ne lokopkaaree rajya kii poonjeewaadi jadon ko spasht karte hue dikhaaya he ki ye model udaarataavaadi, anudaarataavaadi or saamaajik-janavaadee kism ke hai
 Neo-classical economics, which took place in the mid-twentieth century, advocated an economic science independent of the influence of politics as opposed to political economics
 is pravriti ke bolbaale ke daur main sambhavtah joseph shumpiter kii rachana capitalizam, soshalzim and democraisi ek aisi kriti thi jisamen antarnihit tha ki arthshaastra kaa adhyayan raajnneeti ke adhyayan se judaa he
 In the light of market failure, political economics has re-asserted its claim over the past few decades
 iskaa ek bada pramaan us samay mila jab disambar, 2007 main nobel puraskaar lete hue teen arthshaastriyon ne alag-alag bhaashan diye
 The three not only underlined the need for integration of political institutions and economic institutions in their own ways, but also said that this integration has generally taken place
 unka kahana tha ki akhirkaar donon hi kism kii sansthaayen apane-apane kism ke tantron kii numaaindgi karti hai, unke bich paraspar nirbharta he or donon hi parinaam hasil karne main anivaary bhoomika nibhaati hai
 Mayerson said that it is necessary to give importance to economics, but it cannot be cut off from politics
 prayek saamaajik sanstha vibhinn tarah ke protsaahanon ko aarthik or raajnneetik pahaluon se mila kar khadi kii jaati he
 a better social institution is one in which this mixture is done wisely
 tabhi vah galat nirnyon or vibhinn baadhaon se paar paane ke liye sakriy or samanvit prayaas kar paati he
 There is no doubt that the separation of economics and political science has contributed to the development of the field of knowledge
 vidwaanon kii kai pidiyon ne ek- duusare se swatantra or swytt adhyayan karke na jane kitne siddhanton or vichaaron kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 In this process, the subject is redefined in new and better analytical perspectives
 lekin, vyaavhaarik drushtikon se yah algaav kabhi vishuddh aarthiki yaa vishuddh raajnneetik- vigyaan ke vikaas kaa rasta nahin khol paaya
 Now the integration of the two is once again being discussed, although scholars of both disciplines are already working in mutual fields
 yahan tak ki navaudarataavaadi nitiyon main bhi yah nirbharta badi he

 Vikram No
 of Dhang According to the genealogy given in the Khajuraho writings of 1011, Vishvashrukka was a Nripa Nunuk in the lineage of Puranpurush, Jagannirmata, Rishi Marichi, Atri, Muni Chandratreya Bhumijam, whose sons and husbands and grandchildren were Jayashakti and Vijayashakti
 vijay ke baad kramash: raahil, harsh, yashovarman or dhang raja hue
 In fact, this dynasty starts from the Nunuk itself and on the basis of the records and the legends, they have been related to the Gurjar Khajuraho from the beginning
 arab itihaas ke lekhak kamil ne bhi inako "kajurah" main rakhaa he
 To remove the date of Nunuk, the founder of this dynasty from Dhang, if we keep a period of 20-25 years for each generation, then about 120 years before the date of Nunuk, six generations before Dhang i

 devpal se yah murti yashovarman ko mili
 Some scholars consider this to be a sign of the Chandela's victory over the Pratihara king, but the fact is that the title "hayapati" was related only to the Pratihara emperor
 kadachit vah koi sthaneey raja rahaa hoga
 Dhangadeva Gurjar was the most famous and powerful king among the Chandels and ruled for 50 years
 uske lambey rajyakaal main khajuraho ke do prasiddh mandir vishwanath tathaa parswanath bane

 The title of Hammirvarman was probably due to Muslim influence; Other people of the dynasty were also given positions of authority in governance

 Most of the Chandela temples are in Khajuraho
 kuch mahoba main bhi hai
 They were mainly built between the middle of the 10th century and the middle of the 11th century
 ye shaiva, vaishnav or jain teenon hi dharmon ke hai
 The influence of the trends of other areas can also be found in these temples, but primarily the fundamental characteristics of the Chandel artist are seen in them

 Kautilya's 'arthashastra' is an important work of political principles
 is sambandh main yah prashn uthta he ki kautilya ne apni pustak kaa naam 'arthshaastra' kyon rakhaa? prachinkaal main 'arthshaastra' shabd kaa prayog ek vyapak arth main hota tha
 Under this, the study of political science, theology, economics, law etc
 was originally done
 acharya kautilya kii drushti main raajnneeti shaastra ek swatantra shaastra he or anvikshiki, trayee tathaa vaarta env kanoon aadi uski shakhaayen hai
 The entire society is protected by politics or penal system or only the protected subjects can follow their duties
 us samay arthshaastra ko raajnneeti or prashasan kaa shaastra mana jaataa tha
 There is a context in this connection in the Mahabharata, in which Arjuna is considered an expert on economics
 nishchit rup se kautilya kaa arthshaastra bhi rajshastra ke rup main liya gaya hoga, yon usne arth kii kai vyakhyaayein kii hai
 Kautilya has said - Manushayanam vritirartha, that is to say, the meaning of the livelihood of human beings
 arthshaastra kii vyakhya karte hue usne kaha he—tasya pruthivya laabhpalnopaayah shaastramarth-shastramiti
 Thus, it is also clear that 'economics' includes principles related to both the polity and the economy
 vastutah kautilya 'arthshaastra' ko keval rajvyavastha or arthvyavastha kaa shaastra kahana upyukt nahin hoga
 In fact, it is the scripture related to economy, state, law, social system and religious system
 kautilya ke 'arthshaastra' ke purv or bhi kai arthshaastron kii rachana kii gayi thi, yadhyapi unki pandulipiyaan uplabdh nahin hai
 In India, since ancient times, efforts have been made for the combination and combination of meaning, work and religion and for this there are detailed discussions in the scriptures, memories and Puranas
 kautilya ne bhi 'arthshaastra' main arth, kaam or dharm kii prapti ke upayon kii vyakhya kii he
 In the 'kamasutra' of Vatsyayan, sources have been composed in relation to the meaning, religion and work
 apane purv arthshaastron kii rachana kii baat swayan kautilya ne bhi sweekaar kiya he
 In his 'arthashastra' he has mentioned Acharya Vrihaspati, Bharadwaja, Shukracharya, Parashar, Pishun, Vishalaksha etc
 in many references
 kautilya ke purv anek aacharyon ke granthon kaa namakaran dandniti ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 It seems that Kautilya's earlier scriptures were called Dandaniti and were similar to Arthashastra
 parantu jaisaa ki anek vidwaanon ne sweekaar kiya he ki dandniti or arthshaastra donon samroop nahin hai
 U
 N
 According to Ghoshal's statement, Arthashastra is a more comprehensive scripture, whereas Dandaniti is only its branch
 kautilya ke paashchaat likhe gayi shaastra 'nitishastra' ke naam se vikhyath hue, jaise kaamandak nitisar
 By the way, many scholars have considered economics more comprehensive than ethics
 parantu, adhikansh vidwaanon kii raay main nitishastra or arthshaastra donon samroop hai tathaa donon ke vishay kshetra bhi ek hi hai
 Kamandaka himself has considered ethics and economics to be identical
 uparyukt vivechan se yah spasht he ki kautilya ke 'arthshaastra' ke purv or uske baad bhi 'arthshaastra' jaise shastron kii rachana kii gayi
 In this regard, there are a large number of scholars who believe that Kautilya was not the creator of 'arthashastra'
 aise vidwaanon main paashchaatya vidwaanon kii sankhya zyada he
 Stan, Jolly, Winterneese and Keith are exponents of this type of thought

 bhandarkar ne bhi iskaa samarthan kiya he
 Bhandarkar has said that Patanjali did not mention Kautilya in the Mahabhashya
 'arthshaastra' ke rachayita ke rup main kautilya ko nahin manyata denevaalon ne apane mat ke samarthan main nimnlikhit tark prastut kiye hai— It is clearly written at the end of the book- saath hi yah bhi likhaa gaya he: This incident is discussed in Vishnu Purana as follows: ‘nitisar’ ke karta kaamandak ne bhi ghatana kii pushti karte hue likhaa he: It is clear from these quotes that Vishnugupta and Kautilya were the same person
 ‘arthshaastra’ main hi dwitiya adhikaran ke dasham adhyay ke ant main pustak ke rachayita kaa naam ‘kautilya’ bataaya gaya he: By writing 'kautilyan Kritam Shastra' at the beginning of the book and 'iti Kautiliyearthastra' at the end of each chapter, the author has made his' Kautilya name more famous
 jahaan-jahaan anya aacharyon ke mat kaa pratipaadan kiya he, ant main ‘iti kautilya’ arthath kautilya kaa mat he-is tarah kahkar kautilya naam ke liye apana adhik pakshpaat pradarshit kiya he
 But it is absolutely undisputed that Vishnugupta and Kautilya were integral persons
 uttarkalin dandi kavi ne ise acharya vishnugupt naam se yadi kaha he, to banbhatta ne ise hi kautilya naam se pukaara he
 The statement of both is that this Acharya composed 'dandaniti' or 'arthashastra'
 panchatantra main isi acharya kaa naam chanakya diya gaya he, jo arthshaastra kaa rachayita he
 In the poet visakhadatta-praneeth well-known drama Mudrarakshas, chanakya is sometimes referred to as Kautilya and sometimes Vishnugupta
 ‘arthshaastra’ kii rachana ‘shashan-vidhi’ ke rup main pratham maury samraat chandragupta ke liye kii gai
 Therefore, it is appropriate to consider the period of its creation as the period of the emperor Chandragupta

 Seeing the table of contents of economics, it is well proved that it is a mistake to call it the book of economics nowadays
 pratham adhikaran ke prarambh main hi swayan acharya ne ise 'dandniti' naam se suchit kiya he
 Shukracharya has described Dandaniti as such an important discipline that it has assumed the presence of all other disciplines - because according to the dictation of 'shastren Rakshe Deshe Shastraschhinta Pravartate', there can be concern or practice of other scriptures in the country, well protected and protected by weapons
 is
 at: dandniti ko anya sab vidyaon kii aadharbhoot vidya ke rup main sweekaar karnaa aavashyak he or vahi dandniti arthshaastra he
 The term 'dialogue' has been used for what is now called economics, although the term is not entirely indicative of economics
 kautilya ne vaarta ke teen ang kahe hai - krishi, vaanijya tathaa pashu-paalan, jinase praaia: vritti yaa jeevika kaa uparjan kiya jaataa tha
 The scholars of Manu, Yajnavalkya etc
 have also accepted the dialogue of these three parts
 peeche shukracharya ne is vaarta main kuseed ko bhi vritti ke saadhan-rup main sammilit kar diya he
 But economics has been described by all the scholars as politics, politics or governance
 at: ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ ko raajnneeti kii pustak samajhnaa hi thik hoga na ki sampattishastra kii pustak
 By the way, in some cases, the relevant topics of wealth creation, wealth and wealth exchange, wealth division etc
 have also been discussed
 ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ ke pratham adhikaran kaa praarambhik vachan is sambandh main adhik prakaash daalane vaala he: That is, this one economics has been created by taking the summary of all the economics which the ancient masters have written to win the earth and show the ways of rearing
 yah uddhran arthshaastra ke vishay ko jahaan spasht karata he, vahaan is satya ko bhi prakashit karata he ki ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ se purv anek aacharyon ne arthshaastra kii rachanaaen kin, jinka uddeshy prithvi-vijay tathaa uske paalan ke upayon kaa pratipaadan karnaa tha
 Some names of those Acharyas and their sects have been directed in 'kautilya Arthashastra', although their works are not available even today
 ye naam nimnlikhit he: In the tenants of these ten sects of economics, almost everything is known in relation to everyone, but very little introduction is found about Vishalaksha
 in naamon se yah to atyant spasht he ki arthshaastra nitishastra ke prati anek mahaan vichaarkon tathaa darshanikon kaa dhyaan gaya or is vishay par ek ujjwal sahitya kaa nirmaan hua
 Today that literature is lost
 anek videshi akramanon tathaa rajyakrantiyon ke kaaran is sahitya kaa naam-maatr shesh rah gaya he, parantu jitna bhi sahitya avshisht he vah ek vistrut arthshaastreey parampara kaa sanket karata he
 In this Arthashastra, such a system of governance has been enacted in which the king or ruler rules for the welfare of the subjects
 raja swechhachari hokar shashan nahin kar saktaa
 He has to rule over the subjects only after getting the help of the Council of Ministers
 rajya-purohit raja par ankush ke samaan he, jo dharm-maarg se chyut hone par raja kaa niyantran kar saktaa he or use kartavya-paalan ke liye vivash kar saktaa he
 Kautilya, which is the form of an all-round nation, is clear from the following word of 'arthashastra' - arthath-praja ke sukh main raja kaa sukh he, prajake hit main uskaa hit he
 The king has nothing but his own love, the beloved of the people is his favorite
 400 ri0 san ke lagbhag kaamandak ne kautilya ke arthshaastra ke aadhaar par kaamandakeey nitisar naamak 20 sargon main vibhakt kavyarup ek arthshaastra likhaa tha
 It also considers the principles of ethics and foreign policy
 somdev suri kaa nitivakyamrita, hemachandra kaa laghu arthniti, bhoj kaa yuktikalpataru, shukr kaa shukraniti aadi kuch duusare suprasiddh arthshaastra hai, jinako nitishastra ke vyaavhaarik paksh kii vyakhya karne vaale granthon ke antargat bhi gina ja saktaa he

 rasagulla ek bhartiya pakwaan he, jo chhena tathaa chini se banaaya jaataa he
 It is mainly popular in Odisha and West Bengal
 aavashyak saamagree - The main ingredient for making rasgulla is chenna, which we can bring from dairy by calling it fresh chenna or we can make it at home with milk
 yadi hamako chhina ghar par bananaa hai to sabase pehle ham rasagulle banane ke liye chhina banaayege
 Cana to milk to make it out in a heavy bottom pan and heat it
 After boiling the milk, add lemon juice and stir with a spoon
 When the milk bursts completely, the chenna and water starts appearing separately in the milk, then immediately stop the fire
 Strain the chenna into a cloth and pour cold water over it so that the lemon flavor does not remain in the chenna
 Remove excess water by pressing the cloth by hand
 Chena is ready to make rasgulla
 chhina ko badi thali main nikaal lijiye, arorut mila kar chhina ko acchhee tarah mathiye
 chhina ko itnaa mathiye ki vah chikna guthe huye aate kii tarah dikhaai dene lage
 rasagulla banane ke liye chhina taiyaar he
 With this chena, remove the chena little by little
 Make small balls of one-inch to one-inch diameter and keep them in a plate
 Make shells in this way for all rasgullas and cover them with a wet cloth for half an hour
 300 gram chini or 1 litre pani kisi bartan main daal kar garam kijiye
 jab pani khaulane lage to chhene se bane gole pani main daal dijiye
 bartan ko dhak dijiye, in chhina ke golon ko, 20 minutes tak medium aag par ubalane dijiye

 1971 kaa bharat-paak yuddh ke baad bharat ke shimla main ek sandhi par hastakshar hue
 This is called the Simla Agreement
 isamen bharat kii taraf se indira gandhi or pakistan kii taraf se zulfiqaar ali bhutto shaamil the
 The pact was made after the fighting between India and Pakistan in December 1971, in which more than 93000 Pakistan soldiers, led by their Lieutenant General Niazi, surrendered to the Indian Army and the then East Pakistan as Bangladesh
 Salvation was obtained from the rule
 yah samjhauta karne ke liye pakistan ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri zulfiqaar ali bhutto apni putree benazir bhutto ke saath 28 june 1972 ko shimla padhaare
 He was the same Bhutto who had vowed to fight India for a thousand years by eating grass bread
 28 june se 1 july tak donon pakshon main kai daur kii vaarta hui parantu kisi samjhaute par nahin pahunch sake
 Pakistan's fanatics were mainly responsible for this
 tabhi achaanak 2 july ko lunch se pehle hi donon pakshon main samjhauta ho gaya, jabaki bhutto ko usee din waapas janaa tha
 The agreement was signed by Benazir Bhutto on behalf of Pakistan and Indira Gandhi on behalf of India
 yah samajhnaa kathin nahin he ki yah samjhauta karne ke liye bharat ke upar kisi badi videshi takat kaa dabaav tha
 The agreement forced India to abandon all of Pakistan's more than 93,000 war-prisoners and also to return 5600 square miles of land won in the war
 iske badale main bharat ko kya mila yah koi nahin jaanata
 Even the 54 Indian prisoners of war in Pakistan could not take them back to India and they are still waiting to return to their country for 41 years
 apana sab kuch lekar pakistan ne ek thotha-sa aashwaasan bharat ko diya ki bharat or pakistan ke bich kashmir sahit jitne bhi vivaad hai, unka samaadhaan aapasi baatcheet se hi kiya jayega or unhen anterrashtriya manchon par nahin uthaaya jayega
 But this single assurance has also been violated by Pakistan hundreds of times and has raised the Kashmir dispute with international impunity several times on international forums
 vastav main uske liye kisi samjhaute kaa mulya utana bhi nahin he, jitna us kaagaj kaa mulya he, jis par vah samjhauta likhaa gaya he
 In this agreement, it was also decided between India and Pakistan that on 17 December 1971, ie after the surrender of Pakistani forces, the line in which the armies of the two countries were, would be considered as the "line of Actual Control" and either side would be on its side
 Will not try to change or violate this line
 lekin pakistan apane is vachan par bhi tikaa nahin rahaa
 It is well known that in 1999, the Pakistani army deliberately infiltrated Kargil and due to this India had to fight a war in Kargil
 julfikar ali bhutto ne 20 disambar 1971 ko pakistan ke raashtrapati kaa padbhaar sambhala
 He inherited a broken Pakistan
 satta sabhanlate hi bhutto ne yah vaada kiya ki vah sheeghra hi bangladesh ko phir se pakistan main shaamil karvaa lenge
 Many Pakistani army officers were dismissed as responsible for the country's defeat
 kai maheene tak chalane vaali raajnneetik-str kii baatcheet ke baad june 1972 ke ant main shimla main bharat-pakistan shikhar baithak hui
 Indira Gandhi and Bhutto discussed with their high-level ministers and officials all the topics that arose from the 1971 war
 saath hi unhone donon deshon ke anya prashnon par bhi baatcheet kii
 Some of the major topics in these were the exchange of prisoners of war, the question of Pakistan's recognition of Bangladesh, normalization of diplomatic relations between India and Pakistan, resuming trade and establishing the Line of Control in Kashmir
 lambi baatcheet ke baad bhutto is baat ke liye sahamat hue ki bharat-pakistan sambandhon ko keval dwipaksheeya baatcheet se tay kiya jayega
 An agreement at the end of the Simla Agreement was signed by Indira Gandhi and Bhutto
 iske praavdhaan nimntah he - It provided that the two countries would try to end their conflict and dispute and it was promised that work would be done for lasting friendship in the sub-continent
 in uddeshyon ke liye indira gandhi or bhutto ne yah tay kiya ki donon desh sabhi vivaadon or samasyaon ke shantipurna samaadhaan ke liye sidhi baatcheet karenge or kisi bhi sthiti main ekatarfa kaarywahi karke koi parivartan nahin karenge
 They will neither use force against each other, nor violate territorial integrity nor interfere in each other's political freedom
 donon hi sarkarein ek duusare desh ke virudgh prachaar ko rokegi or samaacharon ko protsaahan dengi jinase sambandhon main mitrataa kaa vikaas ho
 To normalize relations between the two countries: All communication relations will be re-established
 2 Traffic facilities will be provided so that the people of the two countries can travel easily and establish close relations
 3
 Trade and economic cooperation as far as possible
 Will be re-established soon 4 In the field of science and culture, mutual exchanges will be encouraged
 sthai shantin ke hit main donon sarkarein is baat ke liye sahamat hui ki 1 bharat or pakistan donon kii senaayen apane-apane pradeshon main waapas chali jaaengi
 2 The two countries recognized the ceasefire line of 17 September 1971 as the Line of Control and 3 it was decided that within twenty days of this agreement the forces would withdraw from their respective borders
 yah tay kiya gaya ki bhavishya main donon sarkaron ke adhyaksh milte rahenge or is bich apane sambandh saamaanya banane ke liye donon deshon ke adhikari baatcheet karte rahenge
 Critics of the Simla Agreement in India said that this agreement was in a way a surrender of India to Pakistan because the territories of Pakistan which were occupied by the Indian armies now had to be abandoned
 parantu shimla samjhaute kaa sabase bada laabh yah hua ki donon deshon ne apane vivaadon ko aapasi baatcheet se nipataane kaa nirnay kiya
 This means that the Kashmir dispute will be resolved through mutual negotiations, not by giving it international form

 vastutah diarectory ke shashan ko samaapt kar nepalian ne satta kii thi or france kii janata ne us parivartan ko sweekaar kiya tha to iskaa kaaran tha vah araajaktaa or avyavashtha se ub chuki thi
 Therefore, it was necessary for Napoleon to establish a well-organized governance and law and order in the interior
 pratham counsal banane ke baad nepolian ne france ke liye ek naveen samvidhan kaa nirmaan kiya jo kranti yug kaa chauthaa samvidhan tha
 Through this, executive power was vested in three counselors
 pradhan counsal ko anya counsalaron se adhik shakti praapt thi
 In fact, the Republic certainly showed in the Constitution, but the entire power of the state was concentrated in the hands of Nepalis
 nepolian ne shashan vyavastha kaa kenndrikaran kiya or departments tathaa district kii sthaneey sarkaron ko samaapt kar prefect evam sab-prefects kii niyukti kii
 Their appointment and the appointment of all the mayors of villages and cities were directly done by the central government
 is prakaar prashasan ke kshetra nepolian ne in adhikariyon par paryaapt niyantran rakh prashasan ko chust-durust banaae rakhaa saath hi yogyata ke aadhaar par inaki niyukti kii
 Napoleon's reforms in administrative areas were in a way anti-revolution because the National Assembly had completely decentralized the administrative structure during the revolution and elected representatives were given the responsibility to govern the country, but the Nepalese gave this arrangement Reversed and reestablished pre-revolution system
 us drushti se vah kranti kaa hantaa tha
 Napoleon tried to revive France from its dismal economic situation
 is kram main usne sarvapratham kar pranali ko sucharu banaaya
 The task of collecting tax was done by the central employees and the recovery started strictly
 usne ghoosekhori, sattebaaji, thekedaari main anuchit munaafe par roak laga di
 He emphasized austerity and imposed many indirect taxes on the French people
 nepolian ne france main vittiya gatividhiyon ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye bank of france kii sthapana kii jo aaj bhi kaayam he
 It also set up a separate fund to repay the national debt
 nepolian ne jahaan tak sambhav hua sena ke kharch kaa boj vijit pradeshon par daalaa or france kii janata ko is boj se mukt rakhane kii koshish kii
 Napoleon also stressed the improvement of agriculture and planned to make the barren and sandy areas fertile
 vyapaar ke vikaas ke liye nepolian ne avaagaman ke sadhano kii taraf paryaapt dhyaan diya
 Arranged for mechanical education for the progress of various types of businesses, roads, canals built
 francisi audyogic vastuon ko lokapriy banane ke liye pradarshnee ke aayojan ko badhaava diya or swadeshi vastuon evam udyogon ko protsaahan diya
 Encouraged construction work to overcome the problem of unemployment
 is tarah nepolian ne france ko jarjar or diwaaliyepan kii sthit se ubaara
 But even in terms of economic reforms, Napoleon's actions appear to be anti-revolution
 krantikaal main pratyaksh karo par bal diya gaya tha jabaki nepolian ne apratyaksh karon par bal dekar puraatan vyavastha ko sthapit karne kii koshish kii
 In the same way, Napoleon displayed an anti-revolutionary mindset by prioritizing the commercialist philosophy
 uskaa maananaa tha ki rajya ko kosh kii suraksha evam vyapaar main santulan laane ke liye sakriy hastkshep karnaa hoga jabaki kranti kaa bal to mukt vyapaar par tha
 The Nepalese wanted citizens who had faith in him and his system
 iske liye usne shiksha ke rashtriya evam dharmanirpeksh swaroop apanaate hue sudhaar kiye
 Organized education at primary, secondary and higher levels
 sarkaar ke dwaara niyukt shikshakon kii sahaayta se chalane vaale in skulon main ek hi paathyakram, ek hi pathyapustaken ek hi vardi rakhi jaati thi
 Napoleon established a university in Paris and taught subjects in Latin, French, science, mathematics, etc
 yah uniwarsity vishvavidhyalay ke saamaanya arth main koi uniwarsity nahin thi varan praathmik se ucchtar shiksha tak kii sabhi sansthaaon ko ekasutra main baandhne vaali ek vyavastha kii
 Its aim was to keep maximum government control over education and to make students loyal to the government
 nepolian ne shodh kaaryon ke liye insticute of france kii sthapana kii
 Napoleon showed no interest in women's education
 unki shiksha kaa bhaar dharmik sansthaaon par chhod diya gaya
 The majority of France's population was under the influence of the Catholic Church
 kranti ke dauraan carch kii shakti ko kamjor kar use rajya ke adheen le aayaa gaya
 Church property was nationalized and clergy were asked to take an oath of loyalty to the state
 isse pope naaraaz hua or aam janata ko virodh karne ke liye uksaaya
 As a result, there was tension between the government and the public
 nepolian ne ise dur karne ke liye 1801 se pope ke saath samjhauta kiya jise konkardet kaha jaataa he
 He had the following provisions
 nepolian kaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn or sthaayee kaary tha- vidhi samhita kaa nirmaan
 In fact, before the revolution, the law and order of France was different and there were so many types of laws that even those who followed the law did not know them and this chaos increased even during the revolution
 nepolian ne is avyavashtha ko dur kiya
 Napoleon himself considered his Code of Law more powerful than his 40 wars
 is code ke dwaara nepolian ne france main sarvlokik kanoon paddati kii sthapana kii
 Under the Civil Code, he strengthened the authority of the head of the family
 striyaan purushon ke adheen rakhi gai or pati kaa kaary patni kii raksha karnaa he
 The divorce method was made difficult
 civil vivaah kii vyavastha bhi is samhita main kii gai
 Thus, by recognizing the practice of civil marriage and divorce, Napoleon practiced in Europe that the work of society could go on without the cooperation of the priests
 is prakaar anya samhitaayein jaise vyapaar sambandhi kanoon samhita, Code of Criminal Proc
 aadi banaae gaye
 The interests of the laborers were ignored in its trading code and the ban on their unions continued
 is drushti se nepolian ne kranti ke aadarshon ke viruddh kaary kiya
 Despite this, the importance of this law code was to provide uniformity of law throughout the country and to simplify the judicial system practically
 jahaan-jahaan nepolian kii senaayen gai yah samhita lagu kii gai or nepolian ke paraajay ke baad bhi barkaraar rahi
 It is a permanent fame of Napoleon
 nepolian ke vidhi samhita main burjua varg ke hiton par zyada jor diya gaya he
 The officer related to land was further strengthened and the protection of personal property was further strengthened and a number of laws were enacted to protect personal property
 tered union bananaa aparaadh ghoshit kiya gaya
 In case of litigation, the owners were asked to accept the claims of the owners in lieu of the arguments of the workers
 naagarik samhita kaa aadhaar saamaajik samta bhi he
 Privilege and feudal rule had no place in the Code
 bade putr ko sampatti kaa uttaradhikari maanane kaa kanoon bhi nahin tha sampatti par sabhi putron ko barabari kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 Napoleon established a new elite in society
 usne aay ke hisaab se oopaadhiyon kaa kram nirdhaarit kiya
 This work of Napoleon was contrary to the ideals of revolution
 europe raajnneetik kshitij par nepolian kaa pradurbhaav ek ghumaketu kii tarah hua or apni prakriya tathaa parishram ke bal par vah sheeghra hi europe kaa bhaagyavidhaataa ban baitha
 In it, everyone was amazed by his amazing military and administrative abilities
 parantu uski shakti kaa stambh jaise baalu kii bhit par khadaa tha
 What collapsed within a few years was virtually the rise and fall of Napoleon like a dazzling meteor
 vah europe ke akaash main sainik safalataa ke bal par chamakta rahaa parantu paraajay ke saath hi uske bhagya kaa sitara dub gaya
 The empire, which was established after hard work, ended on seeing that there were many reasons for its downfall, which are the same
 aseem mahatvakanksha- Napoleon was infinitely ambitious
 aseem mahatvakankshi kisi vyakti ke patan kaa mukhya kaaran sabit hoti he
 The same thing happened with Napoleon
 yuddh main jaise- jaise- uski vijay hoti gai vaise- vaise uski mahatvakanksha badhaata gaya or vah vishwa rajya kii sthapana kaa swapan dekhne laga
 He would not have to see the plight of the downfall if he was satisfied with a little and took care of the conquered empire and spent his time in it
 charitrik durbalata- Napoleon was full of courage, restraint and patience, but in his eyes, hatred was his vengeance and his stigma of forgiveness
 uske charitra kii badi durbalata yah thi ki vah sandhi ko sammanit samjhauta nahin maanata tha
 Friendship of any country was no more than a political necessity for him
 dhire- dhire vah ziddee banataa gaya use yah vishwaas tha ki uskaa prayek kadam thik he
 He could never forget, he began to ignore the advice of others
 falat: uske sachche mitra bhi usase dur hote chale gaye
 Napoleon's system was based on militarism- uski raajnneetik pranali sanyavad par aadhaarit thi jo iske patan kaa pradhan kaaran sabit hua
 He depended on the army in all matters, as a result he was always involved in war
 vah yah bhul gaya ki sainikwaad sirf sankat ke samay hi laabhakaari ho saktaa he
 As long as France was clouded by plagues, the people there supported him
 As soon as the plagues were removed, the people stopped supporting him
 francisi janata kii sahanubhuti or prem kaa khona uske liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Apart from this, the defeated nations became his enemies, who rose up against him as soon as the opportunity arose
 itihaaskaar kabbon ne thik hi likhaa he
 'napoleon's empire flourished in war The war was the basis of his existence and it ended in war itself
 ’ Defective military system prarambh main france kii sena desh prem kii bhaavana se otprot thi
 He used to fight for an ideal and to serve a purpose
 parantu jyon- jyon uske samrajya kaa vistaar hua sena kaa rashtriya rup vidhitat hota gaya
 At first, French troops were included in his army but later German German Purtagali and Dutch soldiers were added to it
 falat: uski sena anek rajyon kii sena ban gai
 There was no ideal and purpose before him
 at: uski sainik shakti kamjor padati gai or yah uske patan kaa mahatvapurn kaaran sabit hua
 Weakness of the Navy nepolian ne sthal sena kaa sanghathan thik se kiya tha kintu uske paas shaktishali nausena kaa abhaav tha, jiske kaaran use england se parajeet hona padaa
 If he had a powerful navy he would not have to be defeated by England
 vijit pradeshon main deshbhakti kaa abhaav- The territories he conquered were not in the hearts of the people, but he had goodwill and love for them
 ve nepolian kii shashan se ghrinaa karte the
 When his power began to weaken, his subordinate states began to strive for their independence
 europea raashtra ne uske khilaaf sangh ke liye chaturth gut kaa nirmaan kiya or isi ke chalate waterlu ke yuddh main use parajeet hona padaa
 Enmity with the pope mahadwipiya vyavastha ke kaaran usne pope ko apana shatru bana liya
 When the Pope refused to accept the same continental system, he took over Rome in April 1808
 or 1809 i
 main pope ko bandi bana liya falat: catholicon ko yah vishwaas ho gaya ki nepolian ne keval rajyon kii swatantraaa nasht karne vaala daanav he
 Otherwise, they also destroy their religion
 audyogic kranti- It is said that he was defeated not in the grounds of Waterloo but in the factories of Manchester and the iron cladding of Barkingdhan
 audyogic kranti ke falswarup england main bade -2 kaarkaane khole gaye or dekhte hi dekhte england samrudh ban gaya
 As a result, he was able to meet his army's modern assassin, which proved fatal to Napoleon
 mahadwipiya vyavastha- The continental system was quite forgotten
 vah england ko sabase bada shatru maanata tha
 England's mainstay of power was naval and worldwide trade and Napoleon could not destroy his naval power, so his trade was tried to strike
 isi uddeshy se usne mahadwipiya vyavastha ko janm diya usne aadesh jari kiya ki koi desh england ke saath vyapaar nahin kar saktaa he
 And neither can use England made
 yah nepolian kii bhayankar bhul thi
 This arrangement trapped him in a trap that was difficult to get out of
 isliye mahadwipiya vyavastha iske patan kaa mukhya kaaran mana jaataa he
 War with the Portuguese purtegal kaa england ke saath vyapaarik sambandh tha kintu nepolian ke dawaab ke kaaran use england se sambandh todna padaa
 This caused considerable damage to Purtigal
 isliye usne phir se england ke saath vyapaarik sambandh kaayam kiya
 Napoleon was enraged and attacked Purtagal
 yah bhi nepolian ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Conflict with Spain nepolian kii teesri bhul spain ke aantarik maamle main hastkshep tha
 Millions of its soldiers were killed
 falat: is yuddh main uski sthiti bilkul kamjor ho gai
 Which encouraged his opponents, when Napoleon made his brother king of Spain, the inhabitants there were not ready to consider that foreigner as king
 unhone nepolian kii sena ko spain se bhaga diya
 Other countries were also encouraged by that rebellion and they also started revolting, which made its fall inevitable
 rus kaa abhiyaan- Napoleon heavily invaded Russia and Russia did not accept its continental system
 isapar nepolian ne rus par akraman kar diya
 In this, however, Moscow was captured but it had to suffer great damage
 uske virodhiyon ne akraman karne kii yojana banaai
 He had to be defeated in this attack
 thakaan- He was tired of being constantly busy in many wars
 50 tourists have written that the entire word for the fall of Napoleon lies in the same word fatigue
 jyon- jyon vah yudadh main ulajhata gaya tyon- 2 uski shakti kamjor padati gai vah thak gaya or uske chalate bhi uskaa patan jaruri ho gaya
 Relative uske patan ke liye uske sage sambadhi bhi kam uttaradaayi nahin the
 However, he used to behave generously towards his relatives
 lekin jab bhi vah sankat main padataa tha to uske sambandhi uski madad nahin karte the
 Organization of quartz nepolian kii kamajori se laabh uthaakar uske shatruon ne chaturth gut kaa nirmaan kiya or mitra rashtron ne use parajeet kiya
 He was captured and sent to Salbai and was made independent ruler there but Napoleon could not stay there for a long time
 He soon returned to France and became the ruler there
 lekin isbaar vah sirf sau dinon tak ke liye samraat rahe
 The Allies were finally defeated in the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815 AD
 vah pakad liya gaya mitra rashtron ne use kaidi ke rup main saint helena naamak tapu par bhej diya jahaan 52 varshon kii aayu main 1821 i
 main uski mrityu ho gai
 Thus, all the above reasons were directly and indirectly responsible for his downfall
 He built his empire through war and it also fell due to the wars
 arthath jin tatwon ne nepolian ke samrajya kaa nirmaan kiya tha unheen tatwon ne uskaa vinaash bhi kar diya

 Its most notable change, as an adaptation of the phonetic Phoenician alphabet, is the inclusion of vowel letters, without which Greek would have been unreadable
 semitic varnmaala main swar chinh multah prayog nahin kiye gaye
 In the preceding Western Semitic script family, a letter was always used for consonants with a nonspecific vowel

 In contrast, Greek is an indo-european language, so the difference in vowel produces a large difference in meaning

 For lexical materials, this would normally be a sufficient feature, but whenever long vowels η and ω come out of the verbal system - and they are ubiquitous like α, ι and υ - they have to be considered graphically
 Two other long vowels derive pictorial distinctions - long closed e and long closed u - both are understood by the picture
