 benign: Hepatocellular adenoma · Cavernous hemangioma Template: Endocrine gland neoplasia dasharath valmiki ramayana ke anusaar ayodhya ke raghuvanshi raja the
 He belonged to the Ikshvaku clan and was the father of Lord Shri Ram, an incarnation of Vishnu
 dasharath ke charitra main adarsh maharaja, putron ko prem karne vaale pita or apane vachanon ke prati purna samarpit vyakti darshaya gaya he
 He had three wives - Kaushalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi
 angadesh ke raja romapad yaa chitrarath kii dattak putree shaanta maharishi rishyashrung kii patni thim
 According to one incident, Shanta was the daughter of Dasaratha and was adopted by Rompad
 dasharath adhed umr tak pahunch gayi the lekin unka vansh samhaalane ke liye unka putr rupi koi vanshaj nahin tha
 He thought of performing Ashwamedha Yagna and Putrakameshti Yagya for son Kamana
 unke ek mantri sumantra ne unhen salaah di ki vah yah yajna apane damaad rishyashrung yaa saadhaaran kii bolchaal main shrungi rishi se karavaayen
 Brahmarshi Vashistha was the total guru of Dasharatha
 vah unke dharm guru bhi the tathaa dharmik mantri bhi
 Only the Dharma Guru had the right to preside over all their religious ceremonies
 atah vashishtha kii ajna lekar dasharath ne shrungi rishi ko yajna kii adhyakshata karne ke liye aamantrit kiya
 The Sringi Rishi completed both the Yajna well and during the Putrakameshti Yajna, a supernatural yagya Purusha or Prajapatya Purush was born out of the Yagya Vedi and by offering Prasad of Naivedya in the Swarnapatra to Dasaratha, he said that by giving this prasad to his wives, he will get the son
 Can
 dasharath is baat se ati prasann huye or unhone apni pattarani kaushalya ko us prasad kaa aadha bhaag khilaa diya
 Dasharatha gave half of the remaining part to his second queen Sumitra
 uske bache huye bhaag kaa aadha hissaa unhone kaikeyi ko diya
 After thinking some, he also gave the remaining eighth part to Sumitra
 sumitra ne pehla bhaag bhi yah jaanakar nahin khaaya tha ki jab tak raja dasharath kaikeyi ko uskaa hissaa nahin de dete tab tak vah apana hissaa nahin khaayegi
 Now Kaikeyi ate his share first and Sumitra then ate his share
 isi kaaran ram, bharat tathaa lakshmana va shatrughna kaa janm hua
 After Rama's marriage to Sita, Dasharatha announced that Rama's coronation would take place immediately
 kaikeyi kii ek kubadi daasi thi manthra jisane kaikeyi ko bachapan se paal-pos kar bada kiya tha or kaikeyi ke vivaah ke baad maano uske dahez main uske saath bheji gai thi
 She was a devious politician
 usne kaikeyi ko mantranaa di ki ram ke rajbhishek se kaikeyi kaa bhala nahin varan anhith hi hone vaala he
 He advised Kaikeyi to ask for his two brides from King Dasaratha
 yah ghatana us samay kii he jab dasharath devon ke saath milakar asuron ke viruddh yuddh kar rahe the
 While chasing the Asuras, his chariot got trapped in the mud of war
 us rath kii sarathi swayan kaikeyi thim
 At the same time, Dasharatha was injured by an enemy running a war and he died
 yadi kaikeyi unke rath ko ranbhumi se dur le jaakar unka upachaar nahin karatin to dasharath kii mrityu nishchit thi
 Dasharatha regained consciousness and requested Kaikeyi to ask for any two brides
 us samay ayodhya samrajya kii paristhitiyaan anukool thim tathaa sabhi sauhardrapurn vaataavaran main ji rahe the atah kaikeyi ne vah var maangane se inkaar kar diya or yah kah kar taal diya ki samay aane par vah yah var maang lengi
 Now that Kaikeyi had come to the disguise of the evil Manthara, he realized that he was going to suffer harm after the coronation of Shri Ram, he thought of going to Kopabhavan
 us kaal main ranivas main ek kopbhavan hota tha jahaan koi bhi rani kisi bhi karanvash kupit hokar apni asahmati vyakt kar sakati thi or raja kaa kartavya hota tha ki use kopbhavan ke praangan main jaakar us rani ko manaanaa padataa tha
 King Dasaratha did the same
 jab kaikeyi ne apane do var maangane kii ichha darshai to kamonmukt raja dasharath raji ho gayi
 It should not be forgotten here that Kaikeyi was the youngest queen of Dasharatha and King Dasaratha himself reached the fourth period
 atah unka kaikeyi ke prati vaasana jaagnaa swaabhaavik tha or us vaasana ke liye jo bhi ban pade vah nibhaane ke liye raja dasharath tatpar rahete the
 Now Kaikeyi asked the king Dasharatha for that two bridesmaids
 ek se swayan ke putr bharat ko ayodhya kii rajgaddi tathaa duusare se ram ko chaudaa varsh kaa vanvaas
 King Dasharatha could not do this
 unhone kaikeyi ko bahut manaane kii koshish kii
 He was also called bad
 lekin jab kaikeyi ne unki ek na maani to vah aahat hokar vahiin kopbhavan main gir gayi
 When Rama came to know about this subject, he himself went near Dasaratha and urged him that he should give Kaikeyi both brides keeping in view the dignity of Raghukul
 unhone hath karke raja ko in baton ke liye manaa liya or sanyasiyon ke vastra pahanakar sita tathaa lakshmana ke saath van kii ore nikal pade
 Dasaratha could not tolerate this shock and gave up his life
 ramayana main dasharath kaa naam iske baad tabhi aayaa he jab ram apane aapako dasharath-putr kahkar yaa to sambodhit karte hai yaa phir apana is sandarbh main parichay dete hai

 In addition, the US NRC and the US Department of Energy have begun research into the sustainability of lightwater reactors that are expected to allow reactor licenses to extend beyond 60 years, with an increase of 20 years, provided that safety is maintained
 To be retained, as non-co2-emission generating capacity by returning reactors "may challenge US energy security, potentially leading to greenhouse gas emissions
" May increase Srgn and power of an imbalance between demand and supply
 " In 2008, the International Atomic Energy Agency forecast that nuclear power capacity could double by 2030, although this would not be sufficient to increase the nuclear share of electricity generation
 jis prakaar kai paramparaagat tapiya urja centre, jeevashm eendhan ke jalane se nikalne vaali taap urja ke dohan se bijli utpann karte hai, vaise hi parmaanu urja sanyantr, aam taur par parmaanu vikhandan ke madhyam se ek parmaanu ke nabhik se nikali urja ko parivartit karte hai
 When a relatively large fissile atomic nucleus absorbs a neutron, fission of that atom often results
 vikhandan, parmaanu ko gatij urja ke saath do yaa do se adhik chote nabhik main vibhajit karata he or gamma vikiran or mukt neutron ko bhi chodta he
 a portion of these neutrons can be absorbed later by another fissile atom and more fission can occur, which will release more neutrons and so on

 Fusion reactors, which may become viable in the future, will reduce or eliminate many of the risks associated with nuclear fission
 ek parmaanu riector, parmaanu urja ke liye jivan chakra kaa hi hissaa he
 This process starts with mining
 Uranium mines are underground, open-pit, or in-situ leach mines
 kisi bhi haalat main, uranium ayask ko nikaala jaataa he, aamtaur par ek sthir or thos rup main parivartit kiya jaataa he, jaise yallokek or phir use kisi prasanskaran suvidha main bheja jaataa he
 Here, the yolkok is converted into uranium hexafluoride, which is then cultured using various techniques

 Fuel rods complete about three operational cycles inside the reactor, typically until about 3% of their uranium is broken down, then sent to a spent fuel pool where the short-lived isotopes generated by fission are destroyed
 ek shitalk talab main lagbhag 5 saal ke baad, kharchit eendhan radiodharmee or tapiya aadhaar par sanbhaalane ke liye paryaapt thanda ho chukaa hota he or use shushk bhandaaran pipon main rakhaa ja saktaa he yaa punah sanvardhit kiya ja saktaa he
 Uranium is a fairly common element found in the earth's crust
 uranium lagbhag utana hi aam he jitna bhu-parpati main tin yaa jarmenium kaa paaya janaa or rajat kii tulana main yah 35 guna aam he
 Uranium is a component of most rocks, dust, and oceans
 yah tathy ki uranium itnaa bikharaa hua he, ek samasya he, kyonki uranium khanan aarthik rup se keval vahiin vyavhaarya he jahaan badi maatra main iskaa sankendran ho
 Nonetheless, the world's currently unexplored uranium resources, which can be economically recovered at a cost of 130 USD / kg, are sufficient to last "at least a century" according to the current rate of consumption
 adhikansh khanijon kii saamaanya tulana main, yah nishchit sansadhano ke ek ucch str ko darshata he
 On the basis of conformance with other metallic minerals, a doubling in price from the current level can be expected to increase the measured resources by tenfold over time
 haalanki, parmaanu urja kii laagat, mukhyatah vidyut centre ke nirmaan main nihit he
 Therefore, fuel's contribution to the total cost of electricity produced is relatively small, so an excessive fuel price increase will have relatively little effect on the final price

 Thorium is 3
5 times more common in uppermost uranium and has different geographical characteristics
 yah kul vyaavhaarik vikhandan-yogya sansaadhan aadhaar ko 450% tak badha degaa
 Unlike the production of U-238 as plutonium, fast breeder reactors are not necessary - this can be satisfactorily edited in more conventional plants
 bharat ne is takanic main jhaankne kii koshish kii he, kyonki iske paas prachur maatra main thorium bhandar hai lekin uranium thodaa hi he
 Advocates of fusion energy commonly propose the use of deuterium or tritium as fuels, both being isotopes of hydrogen and boron and lithium in many current designs
 By assuming a fusion energy output equal to current global production and assuming that it will not increase in the future, the known current lithium reserves will last 3000 years, the lithium of seawater will run 60 million years, and a more complex fusion process that seawater Se uses only deuterium and will have fuel for the next 150 billion years

 The most important waste stream from nuclear power plants is spent nuclear fuel
 It is mainly composed of unchanged uranium as well as significant amounts of transsuranic actinides
 In addition, about 3% of it is a fission product derived from the nuclear reaction
 actenids lambi avadhi kii radiodharmita ke bade hisse ke liye jimmedaar hai, jabaki vikhandan utpaada, alpavadhi kii radiodharmita ke bade hisse ke liye jimmedaar hai
 After a nuclear fuel rod reacts 5 percent inside a nuclear reactor, the rod is no longer fit to be used as fuel
 Today, scientists are figuring out how to make these rods reusable so that waste can be reduced and the remaining actinides can be used as fuel
 ek theth 1000-megawatt parmaanu riector, prati varsh kareeb 20 cubic meter kharchit parmaanu eendhan ko utpann karata he 
 america main sabhi vanijyik parmaanu urja sanyantr dwaara aaj kii taarikh tak utpann kharchit eendhan, ek footbal maidan ko ek meter tak bhar saktaa he
 The spent nuclear fuel is initially very high radioactive and therefore must be handled with utmost care and premeditated manner
 haalanki, hajaaron varshon kii avadhi ke dauraan yah kaaphi kam radiodharmee ho jaataa he
 After 40 years, the radiation flux is 99
9%, lower than the moment the spent fuel is removed from operation, although the spent fuel is still dangerously radioactive
 radiodharmee kshay ke 10,000 varshon ke baad, america paryaavaran sangrakshan agency ke maanakon ke anusaar, kharchit parmaanu eendhan se saarvajanik swasthya or suraksha ko koi khatra nahin hoga
 When first extracted, spent fuel rods are stored in water-protected basins, which are usually on site

 Currently most US nuclear waste is stored at the site where it originates, while suitable permanent disposal methods are being discussed
 yatha 2007, sanyukt rajya america, parmaanu riektaron se nikle 50,000 metric ton se adhik kharchit parmaanu eendhan ko jamaa kar chukaa he
 Permanent underground storage in the US was proposed at the Yucca Mountains nuclear waste reserves, but that project has now been effectively scrapped - the permanent disposal of US high-level waste remains an as-yet unresolved political problem

 phir bhi, actenids ko hataa dene ke baavjood bachaa hua apshisht, kam se kam 300 varshon tak ke liye kaaphi radiodharmee hoga or yadi actenids ko andar hi chhod diya jaataa he to hazaron saal tak ke liye
 Even after removing all actinides and destroying long-lived non-actinides by conversion using fast breeder reactors, it is necessary to keep the waste away from the atmosphere for a hundred years to a few hundred years and therefore Are properly classified as a long-term problem
 up-jokhim riector yaa sanlayan riector bhi kachare ko jamaa kiye jane kii avadhi ko kam kar sakate hai
 It has been argued that the best solution for nuclear waste is temporary storage above ground, as technology is changing rapidly

 According to a 2007 story aired in 60 minutes, nuclear power gives France the cleanest air and the cheapest electricity in all of Europe, compared to any other industrialized country
 France recreates its nuclear waste to reduce its mass and generate more energy
 haalanki lekh jari rahata he, "aaj ham kachare ke contenron ko jamaa rakhte hai kyonki vartmaan main vaigyanikon ko yah nahin pataa he ki vishaaktata ko kaise kam yaa samaapt kiya jaae, lekin shaayad 100 varshon baad vaigyanikon ko pataa hoga

 Coal-fired plants are particularly known to produce toxic and mild radioactive ash due to the concentration of naturally occurring metals and the dim radioactive material emitted from coal
 a recent report by Oak Ridge National Laboratory has concluded that coal energy actually delivers more radioactivity to the atmosphere than nuclear energy operations, and that the population effective dose, equivalent to the radiation of the coal plant, from the ideal operation of the nuclear plant 100 times more
 beshak, koyale kii raakh, parmaanu kachare se kaaphi kam radiodharmee he, lekin raakh vaataavaran main sidhe jaati he, jabaki parmaanu sanyantr, vikiranit riector pot, eendhan chaden or site par kisi bhi radiodharmee apshisht se paryaavaran kii suraksha ke liye parirakshan kaa upyog karte hai
 By reprocessing, potentially 95% of plutonium and uranium from the spent nuclear fuel can be recovered by putting it into mixed oxide fuel
 isse bache hue kachare ke bheetar dirghakaalik radiodharmita main kami hoti he, kyonki yah kaaphi had tak ek alpakaalik vikhandan utpaada he or 90% se adhik ek apni maatra kam kar letaa he
 Reprocessing of civilian fuel from energy reactors is currently done extensively in Britain, France and Russia and will soon be done in China and perhaps also in India, and is being done on a larger scale in Japan
 punarsansaadhan kii purna kshamta ko hasil nahin kiya gaya he kyonki iske liye 0}breader riector kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jo abhi tak vanijyik rup se uplabdh nahin he
 
 France is known as the most successful reprocessor, but it reprocesses only 28% of the currently used annual fuel, 7% within France and the remaining 21% in Russia
 anya deshon ke vipareet, america ne 1976 se 1981 tak, america aprasar niti ke ek hisse ke rup main naagarik punarsansaadhan ko roak diya, kyonki punarsansaadhit saamagree jaise plutonium ko parmaanu hathiyaaron main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he: haalanki, america main punarsansaadhan kii ab anumati he
 Nevertheless, all spent nuclear fuel in the US is currently considered waste
 farvari, 2006 main, ek nai america pahal, vaishvik parmaanu urja bhagidaari kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 It will be an international effort to reprocess fuel in a way that makes nuclear proliferation unviable, while developing countries will have nuclear power available
 uranium sanvardhan, kai ton ke rikt uranium ko utpann karata he, jo U-238 se bana hota he jisamen se, aasaani se vikhandaneey U-235 isotope ko hataa diya gaya hota he
 The U-238 is a rigid metal with many commercial uses - for example, aircraft production, radiation shielding and armor - because it has a higher density than lead
 rikt uranium, hathiyaaron main bhi upyogi he jaise DU penitrater kaa "self shorpen", jisaki vajah he katarani band ke saath fracture kii uranium kii pravriti
 There are also concerns that U-238 may pose a health hazard to groups that are excessively exposed to this material, such as tank crew and citizens who live in areas where DU ammunition a large amount of it has been used in shielding, bombs, missiles, blast heads and bullets
 janvari 2003 main vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne ek report khoj ko jari kiya ki DU yuddh saamagree se sandushan sthaneey kshetra main prabhaav sthal se kuch dasiyon meter tak tha or sthaneey vanaspati or jal kaa sandushan 'behad kam' tha
 The report also states that about 70% of the DU consumed will leave the body after twenty four hours and 90% after a few days
 parmaanu urja sanyantron kaa arthshaastra, mukhya rup se vishaal praarambhik nivesh se prabhavit hota he jo ek sanyantr kaa nirmaan karne ke liye aavashyak he
 In 2009, the cost of a new plant in the US is estimated to be between $ 6 to $ 10 billion

 a prestigious panel formed to study the industry for the 2003 MIT found the following: MIT adhyayan ne parmaanu riector ke jivan ke liye ek 40 varsh kii aadhaar-rekha kaa istemaal kiya
 Many existing plants have been extended beyond this period to operate well and studies have shown that extending the life of the plant to 60 years dramatically reduces its overall cost
 anya urja sroton ke saath tulanaatmak arthshaastra kii upar mukhya lekh main or parmaanu urja bahes main charchaa kii gai he
 It has often been claimed that nuclear centers are not flexible in their production, meaning that other forms of energy will be needed to meet peak demand
 haalanki yah kuch riektaron ke maamle main sach he, yah ab kam se kam kuch aadhunik dizine waalon par lagu nahin hota
 Nuclear plants are extensively used in load rearing mode in France

 parmaanu urja bahes us vivaad ke bare main he jo parmaanu eendhan se bijli paidaa karne ke asainik uddeshyon ke liye parmaanu vikhandan riektaron kii tainaati or upyog ke ird-gird chalata he
 The controversy over nuclear power was at its peak during the 1970s and 1980s, when it "became so severe that technology was unprecedented in history" in some countries
 parmaanu urja ke samarthakon kaa tark he ki parmaanu urja ek samposhneey urja strot he jo videshi tel par nirbharta ko kam karte hue carbon utsarjan ko kam karata he or urja suraksha ko badhaata he
 Proponents claim that nuclear power, unlike the major viable alternative to fossil fuels, does not actually cause any conventional air pollution, such as greenhouse gas and art smoke
 Proponents also believe that nuclear power is the only viable way for most Western countries to achieve energy dependence
 samarthakon kaa daawa he ki kachare ke bhandaaran kaa jokhim chota he or jise nae riektaron main naveenatam praudyogiki ke upyog dwaara aage kam kiya ja saktaa he or pashchimi vishwa main anya prakaar ke pramukh urja sanyantron kii tulana main, parichaalan suraksha itihaas utkrisht rahaa he
 Opponents believe that nuclear power poses a threat to people and the environment

 unka yah bhi tark he ki riector khud atyadhik jatil mashine hai jahaan bahut si baaten galat ho sakati hai yaa kar sakati hai or kai gambhir parmaanu durghatnaayen ho chuki hai
 Critics do not believe that the risk of using nuclear fission as a source of energy can be adjusted through the development of new technology
 unka yah bhi tark he ki jab parmaanu eendhan shrinkhalaa ke sabhi urja-gahan charnon par dhyaan diya jaataa he, uranium khanan se lekar parmaanu kaaryamukti tak, parmaanu urja, ek nimna-carbon vidyut strot nahin he
 Security and economics arguments are used by both sides of the debate

 anya shabdon main isaki samta—purnank kaa gundharm jo uskaa sam athwa visham hone kaa nirdhaaran karata he—sam he
 The easiest way to prove this even number is that zero fits precisely in the definition of "even": it is an absolute multiple of 2, typically a zero of 0 × 2 is obtained
 parinamswaroop shunya main wo sabhi gundharm hai jo ek sam sankhya main paye jate hai: 0, 2 se vibhajya he, 0 ke donon ore visham sankhyaayein hai, 0 ek purnank kaa swayan ke saath yoga he or 0 vastuon ke ek samucchy ko do baraabar samucchyon main vipatit kiya ja saktaa he
 According to the standard definition of "even number", zero is even
 ek sankhya ko "sam" kaha jaataa he yadi yah 2 kii purna gunaj ho
 For example 10 is an even number because is equal to 5 × 2
 isi prakaar shunya bhi 2 kaa purna gunaj he jise 0 × 2, likhaa ja saktaa he atah shunya sam he

 un carbonic abhikriyaaon ko punarvinyas abhikriya kehete hai jinamein kisi anu kaa carbon scallyton badalakar mul anu kaa ek sanrachanaatmak samaavyavi banataa he
 Reconfiguration reactions are a very large class of organic reactions
 praayah koi pratisthapi ek parmaanu se usee anu ke kisi duusare parmaanu par chalaa jaataa he
 In the example below, the substituent r moves from carbon atom 1 to carbon atom 2: antar-anuk punarvinyas bhi hote hai
 Reconstitution of Molecules We are well aware that the molecules of organic compounds are formed by special configuration of carbon, hydrogen and other atoms
 in yogicon ke sutron ko, jinase anuon main parmaanuon ke vinyas kaa dhang maaloom hota he
 Reconfiguration indicates irreversible reactions, in which the structure of the molecule changes
 aise parivartanon main saadhaaran anuon main kuch ansh jaise pani, yaa hydrogen hellide, kaa vilopan bhi sambhav he
 This type of reorientation involves only relatively small changes, such as the formation of a double bound, or the transfer of a double bond and a small change in the carbon register
 alilik yogicon ke pratisthaapan main dwibandh kaa sthanantaran bahudhaa dekhne main aata he
 As far as the reconfiguration of the carbon register is concerned, these are often seen only in high-branch systems
 teen pramukh punarvinyas abhikriyaayein ye hai- a 1,2-rearrangement is an organic reaction where a substituent moves from one atom to another atom in a chemical compound
 In a 1,2 shift the movement involves two adjacent atoms but moves over larger distances are possible
 Examples are the wagner-meerwein rearrangement: and the Beckmann rearrangement: a pericyclic reaction is a type of reaction with multiple carbon-carbon bond making and breaking wherein the transition state of the molecule has a cyclic geometry, and the reaction progresses in a concerted fashion
 Examples are hydride shifts and the Claisen rearrangement: Olefin metathesis is a formal exchange of the alkylidene fragments in two alkenes
 It is a catalytic reaction with carbene, or more accurately, transition metal carbene complex intermediates
 In this example, a vinyl compound is dimerized with the expulsion of ethene

 vitt main, ansh athwa share kaa arth kisi company main bhaag yaa hissaa hota he
 The total ownership of a company is divided into millions of crores of pieces
 swaamitv kaa har ek tukdaa ek share hota he
 The more such pieces, the more shares, the greater the stake in the company
 log is hissedari ko kharid-bech bhi sakate hai
 For this, the stock market remains intact
 bharat main bombai stock exange or neshnal stock exange sabase pramukh share bazaar hai
 Often there are two types of shares: ordinary and preferred shares
 saadhaaran share kisi bhi audyogic upkram main niveshak kii aanshik hissedari kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 The common shareholder gets the dividend from the profits of the company he has invested in
 yadi wo company kisi vajah se band ho rahi he to pehle saare hissedaar jaise ki sarkaar, karmchaaree, karjadaata, prifrential shairdharak ko bhugtan kiya jaataa he
 After this, if the amount is left, the common shareholder is paid
 variya share ke naam se hi prathit hota he ki prifrensh shairdharak company kii praathamikta list main aam shairdharakon se upar hota he
 That is, when it comes to payment in case of dividend or closure of the company, preference shareholders are given priority
 paar vailu kisi share kaa anumaanit maan hota he, yani ki wo keemat jo use jari karne vaali company kii balance shit main darj hoti he
 Companies generally have a cross value of Rs 10 or Rs 100
 lekin companiyaan koi bhi paar vailu tay kar sakati hai lekin vah 10 ke gunak yaa ansh main honi chahie jaise ki 13
5
 The company may change the cross value after the initial issue
 koi company paar vailu se adhik mulya ke share jari kar sakati he, jise premium kaha jaataa he, yadi vah sebi ke laabhpradata maandand yaa laabh dein sakane ke paimaane par khari utarati he
 This means that a company will be able to issue fewer shares to raise the required amount and at the same time its dividend liability or dividend liability will be reduced accordingly
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi company ke shares kii paar vailu 50 rupee hai lekin company sebi ke profitability criteria par khari utarati he isliye wo apane sheyaron ko 75 rupee kii keemat par jari kar sakati he
 That is, it can issue at a premium of Rs 25
 yahan ye dhyaan yogya he ki company apana labhaansh yaa dividend share ke paar yaa phase vailu par ghoshit karti he, chaahe wo share kitne bhi premium par jari kyon naa hua ho
 In the case of an initial public offer, companies decide the share price using one of the following three methods: yani phixd price methd ke anusaar jis mulya par share ofer kiye jate hai use company tay kar detii he
 This work is done before the issue opens
 sheyaron kii maang kitni he iskaa pataa company ko tabhi ho paata he jab ishyu band ho jaataa he
 Shares can also be reported at a premium through this method
 is vidhi main niveshak ko ofer kiye share kaa shuddh mulya kaa anumaan nahin ho paata he
 Instead, the company fixes a nominal price range for the stock
 niveshak apni kshamta ke anusaar alag-alag sheyaron ke liye boli lagaate hai
 These bids can be anything within the fixed price range
 sheyaron ke liye ai boli kii maatra ko dekhte hue share kii keemat tay kii jaati he or jitne bhi niveshkon ne iske liye aavedan kiya hota he unhen isi keemat par share die jate hai, chaahe unhone boli main koi or rakam tay kii ho
 It is prevalent in the economic sector that through the book building method one gets a better share price
 oversbskripshan hone par company greenhouse opshan par bhi ja sakati he
 Often, the majority of daters are sold several times over the IPO set limit of good companies, which means they are oversubscribed
 aise main company greenhouse vikalp kaa prayog bhi kar sakati he
 Through this, the company can issue additional shares so that it meets the demand of investors
 haalaanki oversbskripshan ke anupaat ke bare main company ko apane ofer document main pehle se hi bataanaa aavashyak hota he
 Thus, the shares allocated in these three ways get deposited in the demat account of the investor, institution or company
 vyakti kii chalasampatti do prakaar kii hoti he - bhogadhin vastu or vadprapya swawastu 
 Goods are the property that is in your real personal possession, but the claimed object is the property which is not in your immediate possession

 This right is generally attested by an article, for example - by railway receipt
 pramandal main ek ansh bhi vadprapya swawastu he or anshapatr uskaa pramaan he
 But in India, part is considered as goods
 pramandal adhinium 1956 kii dhara 82 kii paribhaasha main kaha gaya he ki pramandal main kisi vyakti kaa ansh yaa anya nihit swaarth 'chal sampatti' mana jayega
 The definition of goods or goods in the Goods Act includes all types of movable property
 isliye pramandal ke ansh keval vadprapya swawastu hi nahin, apitu vastu yaa maal bhi hai
 The true nature of the numerator cannot be explained easily, because the division is completely different from the group of shareholders who make it
 santhaapit pramandal kii anshpunji kaa hona saarvatrik he, yadhyapi anivaary nahin
 It is also equally universal, not mandatory, that capital be divided into fraction of the nominal value
 vah vyakti jiske paas is prakaar kaa ansh he, anshadhari kehalaata he
 Hence each shareholder has a portion of the capital of the division
 lekin vidhik drushti se anshadhari us udhyam yaa kaarkaane kaa aanshik swami nahin he
 Enterprises are somewhat different from the entire capital of the shareholders
 pramandal kii samast parisampatti ukt susangathit santhaan main nihit he, use banane vaale vyaktiyon main nahin
 In terms of legislation, there are certain rights and vested interests of the shareholders as well as some obligations
 anshadhari kaa hit yaa swaarth mahaj chal sampatti se nahin, varan swayan pramandal se hota he
 This selfishness is of a permanent nature
 ansh pramandal main anshadhari kaa vah hit he jo do drushtiyon se dhan kii rakam ke rup main mapa jaataa he, ek to daayitv or labhaansh kii drushti se, duusare byaaj kii drushti se
 And it also includes contracts contained in the Board's Memorandum
 ansh mudra yaa dhan nahin, apitu mudr ke rup main aankaa gaya vah hit he jisamen vibhinn adhikaar or daayitv jude hue hai
 The share is the existing set of rights or entitlements
 udaahranarth, ansh ke kaaran anshadhari pramandal ke laabhon kaa ek samaanupatik bhaag praapt karne, antarniyamon ke aadhaar par pramandal ke kaarobaar main haath bantaane, kaarobaar kii samaapti par sampatti kaa anupatik bhaag paane tathaa sadsyta ke sabhi anya laabhon kaa adhikari ho jaataa he
 There are also some obligations of share
 udaahranarth - pramandal kii parisamapti par purna mulya kii deyta
 All these rights and obligations are a fundamental element of the regular rights and liabilities shares or shares by the Articles of Association

 These knots are - Blowline, Sheet Band and Clove Hitch
