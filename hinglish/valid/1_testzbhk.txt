 Tanks and motorized units were able to move through this rift without the traditional obstacle of infantry's slow logistics
 In this, in the initial phase of an operation, the Air Force attacked planes standing on the ground, bombing their airstrips
 And while trying to dismantle them face-to-air, trying to gain superiority over the enemy air forces

 However, the Luftwaffe was a broad-based military force with no pressing central principle other than that its resources should be used generally to support national strategy
 It was flexible and it was capable of effectively carrying out both operational-tactical and strategic bombings
 lacheelaapan 1939-1941 ke dauraan looftwafe kii takat thi
 Ironically, from that period onwards it became its weakness
 jabaki mitra rashtron kii vaayu senaaon ne army kii madad paane ke liye gathbandhan kiya tha, looftwafe ne apane sansadhano kaa istemaal kahin adhik saamaanya or oparation sambandhi tareeke se kiya

 The concepts associated with the term blitzkrieg - penetrating deep through armored vehicles, extensive sieges, and joint military strikes - mostly relied on terrain and weather conditions

 Additionally, the unit could be prevented by mud or excessive snow

 It should be noted, however, that the losses in such areas could have been reduced to zero if the enemy would have achieved astonishing success by attacking in these areas
 During the French War, the German Blitzkrieg-style attack on France had to pass through the Ardennes

 The earlier successes of the German Army benefited from the superiority of ground forces, along with ground movements, close air support and air reconnaissance

 Along with those attacks, Maxime Weigand's hedgehog tactics became the mainstay to respond to future blitzkrieg attacks: deep deployment, allowing enemy military barges to evade defensive centers, rely on anti-tank guns, enemy The placement of powerful military hairs in the areas of attack, followed by counter-attack on a broad base to demolish the enemy
 Capturing the "shoulder" of flanks or penetrations was necessary to challenge enemy attacks, and properly mounted cannons on the shoulder could inflict heavy damage on the attackers

 In this way they reduced the combat capability of the German Army, despite the fact that German troops had advanced

 Although the mobile operation proved effective in expedited campaigns against Poland and France, it could not be sustained in Germany in later years
 The strategy based on maneuvers poses a natural danger of its invading military force crossing the supply line limits and can be defeated by a determined enemy who will abandon his territory for some time until his reorganization and rearmament
 Be able and willing, as the Soviet Army did on the Eastern Front
 Tank and vehicle production had been a constant problem for Germany; In fact, at the end of the war many Panzer "divisions" had no more than a few dozen tanks

 Although the Polish campaign used early German tanks, stuka dive-bombers and concentrated military forces, much of the war was a war based on traditional infantry and artillery troops, and most of the Luftwaffe's action was in the form of independent ground operations
 mathew kupar ne likhaa he ki John Ellis explained that 


 there is considerable justice in Matthew Cooper's belief that Panzer divisions were not given a type of tactical mission to identify the official armored blitzkrieg, and that it had almost always been close to a large number of different infantry

 When the German motorized forces faced a counter-attack in Arras, British tanks with heavily armed vehicles created an atmosphere of brief terror in the German high command
 Armored and motorized military forces were intercepted by Hitler outside the Port City of Dunkirk, which were being used to drive out Allied forces

 Overall, the Yellow Operation had achieved far more success than most people expected, despite the fact that the Allied forces had 4,000 armored vehicles and the German Army had a capacity of 2,200 more Allied tank armored vehicles and cannons

 On the ground, four huge Panzer armies surrounded the Soviet military forces, surprising and disorganizing them, after which the patrolling infantry completed the siege and defeated the trapped military forces
 The first year of attack on the Eastern Front can generally be considered the last significant successful mobile operation for the German Army

 By the summer of 1944, the reversal of fortune was complete and Soviet military forces in Operation Bagration imposed a defeat through armored vehicles, infantry and air power, known as deep operations, crushing Germany through a joint strategic attack

 After the Allied landing at Normandy, the German army attempted to crush the landing troops with armored attacks, but failed due to lack of coordination and allied air superiority
 The most notable attempt at using deep penetrating operations in Normandy was at Morten, which eroded the German army's position in the already-formed Falais Pocket and eventually proved to be helpful in demolishing German military forces at Normandy

 There has been a widespread debate over whether or not blitzkrieg existed as a favorable military strategy

 There is disagreement as to whether Germany had prepared its war plan around the Blitzkrieg

 Writing on doctrine and training in the German Army 1919–1939, o'neill said: ekmaatr vichaar: blitcraig kaa viksit hona is kahani ko ullekhneey banaata he
 The German army had a broad understanding of the impact of technology on the battlefield and developed a new form of warfare through which when the time of trial came upon their opponents, they proved their superiority in a disappointing manner
 kuch itihaaskaar yah daawa karte hue isse bhi aage jane ke liye taiyaar the ki blitcraig german sainya baalo kaa sirf ek oparation sambandhi siddhant nahin tha, balki ek samrik avadharana thi jisapar third rash ke netritv ne apni samrik or aarthik yojana kaa aadhaar taiyaar kiya
 Those who had prepared the military plans for the Third Rush and organized its war economy, it seems that they rarely, if ever, used the word blitzkrieg in official documents
 The idea that the German military acted on a "blitzkrieg doctrine" was strongly opposed by Matthew Cooper in the 1970s
 ek blitcraig looftwafe kii avadharana ko 1970 ke dashak ke uttarardh main richard overi dwaara or 1980 ke dashak ke madhya main williamson murre dwaara chunauti di gayi thi
 The thesis that the Third Rush descended into war on the basis of "the economics of the blitzkrieg" was opposed by Richard Overy in the 1980s and was highlighted by historian Rödgens in many, slightly conflicting, meanings, where historians interpreted the term Was used
 abhi tak naa keval ek german blitcraig kii avadharana yaa siddhant kaa bhav, lokapriy chetana or lokapriy sahitya main jivit he, balki yah kai peshewar itihaaskaaron ke saath dridhtaa purvak bana hua he
 Continuing from academic monographs it seems that they intend to dig up the "origin" or "roots" of the blitzkrieg
 apni pustak da blitcraig lijend main german itihaaskaar karl-henge freizer ne "blitcraig" ke "ek vishwavyaapee bhram" ke bhav kaa sandarbh diya he
 Fraser, while agreeing with Overy, Cooper, and others, ruled out the existence of the Blitzkrieg Doctrine, and argues that after the Slyphen plan failed in 1914, the German army came to the conclusion that decisive war action took place at a strategic level Can not be completed
 iskaa matlab yah he ki ek shuruaati vyapak str ke hamale kaa vichaar ek shikast dene vaali karrwai main tabdeel nahin ho saktaa he
 Fraser argues that OKW intended to avoid the concepts of decisive fighting of its predecessors, and it planned for a long decisive war of attrition

 It was only after the war in France that the thinking of the German army overturned the possibility of trying a blitzkrieg method for the Balkan campaign and Operation Barbarossa

 The notion that the Third Rush had developed a blitzkrieg strategy to achieve its overall goals was widely opposed
 itihaaskaaron shimon naveh or richard overi ne is vichaar ko asweekaar kar diya ki blitcraig ek sainya siddhant tha
 Says Naweh, "the main feature of Blitzkrieg's concept was the complete absence of a conducive theory that should have served as a general cognitive basis for the actual action of operations
 naveh ne isaki vyakhya oparation sambandhi khataron ke prati ek aise "taatkaalik samaadhaan" ke rup main kii, jise aakiri palon main ek saath jhonk diya gaya tha
 Richard Overy also rejected the idea that Hitler and the Nazi regime had ever intended a blitzkrieg war
 yah suzav jhootha tha ki german rajya ne apni vyapak ranneeti ko nikat bhavishya main chote-chote abhiyaanon kii ek shrinkhalaa ke rup main chalaane ke liye apni arthvyavastha ko jaanboojhkar suvyavasthit kiya tha
 In fact, Hitler wanted to start an unlimited war at a much later date in 1939
 lekin third rash kii videsh niti ne naaji rajya ko iske puri tarah se taiyaar hone se pehle hi yuddh main utarane ke liye majaboor kar diya tha
 The Blitzkrieg method is not reflected in the conduct of Hitler's and Wehrmacht's plans during the 1930s, but rather the reverse

 haris ne nirdeshit kiya he ki german sena ne blitcraig shabd kaa istemaal kabhi nahin kiya
 It was never used in any German military field manual, either in the Army or the Air Force
 yah sitambar 1939 main times akhbaar ke samvaadadaata dwaara pehali baar saamne aayaa
 Harris also dismissed that the German Army's thinking had developed some kind of blitzkrieg mentality
 apni pustak blitcraig lijend main german itihaaskaar karl-henge freizer bhi blitcraig arthvyavastha or ranneeti ke myth par adam tuze kii, overi kii or naveh kii chintaaon kii charchaa karte hai
 Furthermore Fraser states that surviving German economists and members of the German general staff have denied that Germany had entered the war on the basis of a blitzkrieg strategy
 german hathiyaar udyog 1944 tak puri tarah se taiyaar nahin hua tha or yahi kaaran he ki 1960 ke dashak main kuch itihaaskaaron, vishesh rup se alan milward ne blitcraig arthvyavastha kaa siddhant viksit kiya
 Milward argued that the German rash could not fight a protracted war, so it deliberately avoided using weapons to go deep into the scriptures to go into detail and expedite victory
 Be able to win a series
 Milward spoke of a perceived economy situated between a total war economy and a peacetime economy
 The purpose of the Blitzkrieg economy was to help the German people to enjoy a high-powered lifestyle in a war situation and to take measures to avoid the economic difficulties that occurred during the First World War
 overi kehete hai ki blitcraig ek "anukool sainya or aarthik avadharana ke rup main sabooton kii roshni main bachaav ke liye ek mushkil ranneeti siddh hui he"
 milward kaa siddhant hitler ke or german yojanakaaron ke iraadon ke puri tarah se vipareet tha
 It was his fear of the shadow of 1914 that emerged victorious in the duel of objectives between armament in extension for a short war and deep armament for the possibility of a prolonged battle
 german pratham vishwa yuddh kii truti ke bare main jaanate the or isane apni arthvyavastha ko keval ek chota yuddh ladane ke prati unmukh hone kii avadharana ko asweekaar kar diya tha
 Hitler declared relying on only a surprise victory as "criminal" and stated that "we have to be ready for a long-lasting war with surprise attacks
" 1939-40 kii sardiyon ke dauraan, hitler ne jitne adhik kushal shramikon ko kaarkaanon tak waapas laayaa janaa sambhav tha use laane ke kram main ladaai ladane vaali janashakti kaa aakaar gata diya tha
 It was felt that the decision of the war would be taken in factories, not that it would be a quick-decision panzer operation
 1930 ke samooche dashak main hitler ne punah shastreekaran kaarykram kaa aadesh diya tha jise simit nahin samajha ja saktaa he
 In November 1937, Hitler indicated that most of the armament projects would be completed by 1943–45
 Kriegsmarine's rearmament was to be completed in 1949, the Luftwaffe's rearmament program was to be completed in 1942, with the military being able to carry out strategic bombing using heavy bombers
 motoryukt sainya balon kaa nirmaan evam prashikshan or rail networkon kii puri taiyaari kramshah 1943 or 1944 tak shuru nahin hui hoti
hitler ko in pariyojnaon ke puraa hone tak yuddh se bachane kii jarurat thi
 Hitler's wrong decisions in 1939 forced him to go to war before he would be able to complete the task of rearmament
 yuddh ke baad, albert spear ne bataaya ki german arthvyavastha ne, naagarik se sainya udyog main kshamta ko sthanantarit karne ke liye nahin, balki arthvyavastha ko suvyavasthit karte hue vyapak shastreekaran kaa laabh praapt kiya
 Richard Overy stated that as of 1939, 23 percent of German production was in the military form
 1937-1939 ke bich nivesh puunji kaa 70 pratishat rabar, synthetic eendhan ke vikaas, vimaan or jahaaj nirmaan udyog main chalaa gaya tha
 Herman Göring consistently stated that the task of the four-year plan was to rearm Germany for the entire war
 apane arthshaastriyon ke saath adolf hitler ke patrachaar se bhi yah pataa chalata he ki 1943-1945 main unka iraadaa yuddh main daanv lagaana tha jab madhya europe ke sansadhano ko third rash main lagaaya gaya tha
 The standard of living was not high in the late 1930s
 upabhokta vastuon kii khapat 1928 main 71 pratishat se girakar 1938 main 59 pratishat ho gayi thi
 The demands of the war economy had reduced the amount spent in non-military areas to meet the demand of the armed forces
 9 sitambar ko rash raksha parishad ke pramukh, goring ne yuddh kii avadhi ke liye rashtriya arthvyavastha kii aajeevika or ladane kii shakti ke sampurna "kriyanvayan" ke liye aahvaan kiya
 Overy presents this as evidence that a "blitzkrieg economy" did not exist
 adam tuze overi kaa samarthan karte hai
 Toze explains that the German economy was planning for a long battle
 is yuddh ke liye kiya gaya kharch vyapak tha or isane arthvyavastha ko gambhir sankat main daal diya tha
 The German leadership was less concerned about how the civilian economy and the consumption needs of the citizens would be balanced, but instead the concern was how best to prepare the economy for the entire war
 Once the war had started, Hitler requested his economic experts to give up vigilance and spend all available resources in the war effort
 vistaar kii yojanaon ne keval 1941 main dhire-dhire raftaar pakadi
 tuze is baat par kaayam rahe ki yuddh-purv kii avadhi main vyapak shastreekaran kii yojanaayen spasht rup se dekhi gayi kisi blitcraig arthvyavastha yaa ranneeti kaa sanket nahin detii thi
 One argument is that at the beginning of the war Heer himself was not ready for the blitzkrieg
 blitcraig vidhi ko ek yuva, atyadhik kushal yantricrut sena kii aavashyaktaa thi
 In 1939–40, 45 percent of the army was 40 years old and 50 percent of all soldiers were trained for only a few weeks
 german sena, blitcraig lijend ke suzav ke vipareet puri tarah motoryukt nahin thi
 The German army was able to muster only 120,000 vehicles against the French army's 300,000 vehicles
 british sena ke paas bhi motoryukt balon kaa ek "irshyaa yogya" sainya dal tha
 Thus, the image of the German "blitzkrieg" army was a fictional concoction of propaganda
 pratham vishwa yuddh ke dauraan german sena ne rasad ke liye 1
4 million ghodon kaa istemaal kiya, jabaki 1939-45 ke yuddh main isane 2
7 million ghodon kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Also in 1940, only 10 percent of the army was motorized
 1940 main uplabdh german divijanon kaa aadha hissaa ladaai ke liye taiyaar tha, jo aksar british evam francisi senaaon or 1914 kii german sena kii tulana main kharaab tareeke se susajjit the
 The German Army was semi-modern in the spring of 1940
 ek thodi sankhya main sarvshereshth tareeke se susajjit or "kai dwitiya evam tritiy str ke divijanon dwaara abhijaat varg ke divijanon ko sajaayaa gaya tha
 Ninety percent of the German Army was not a blitzkrieg army, except for some motorized and panzer divisions
 james corum luft wafe or iske blitz craig opareshnon ke bare main ek prachlit myth kii charchaa karte hai ki iske paas aatank paidaa karne vaali bambaari kaa siddhant maujuud tha, jisamen aatmavishvaas ko todane or dushman ko dharashayi karne main madad ke liye nagarikon ko jaan-boojhkar nishaanaa banaaya gaya tha
 After the 1937 bombing of Guernica and the 1940 bombing of Rotterdam, it was generally believed that the terrorist bombing was a part of the Luftwaffe doctrine
 yuddh kaal kii avadhi ke dauraan, looftwafe ke netritv ne aatanki bambaari kii avadharana ko asweekaar kar diya tha or hawaii hathiyaaron ko avarohak opareshnon ke ranbhumi sahyog main istemaal tak simit kar diya tha
 Corum further states; General Walther Weaver compiled a theory identified as The Conduct of the Aerial War
 yah dastauez, jise looftwafe ne apanaaya tha, gulio dohat ke aatanki bambaari ke siddhant ko asweekaar kar diya tha
 Terrorist bombing was considered "counterproductive", which would increase resistance rather than destroy the will of the enemy
 aisi bambaari ke abhiyaanon ko looftwafe ke mukhya opareshnon; dushman se sainya balon ke vidhvansh se alag mana jaataa tha
 The bombings of Guernica, Rotterdam and Warsaw were intended as well-planned missions in support of military operations and not as intended for strategic terrorist attacks

 aisa isliye hua kyonki german vimaan udyog ke paas shighrata se ek lambi-duuri kaa bamavarshak bedaa taiyaar karne ke liye anubhav kii kami thi or kyonki hitler bahut teji se badi baari sankhya main sainya bal taiyaar karne par ade hue the
 It is also significant that Germany's position in Central Europe felt the need to keep a fairly clear distinction between bombers necessary for strategic purposes and just for "planned" purposes in the early stages of a future potential war

 lidele heart ko aksar blitcraig ke vikaas se joda gaya he, haalanki yah ek vivaad kaa maamla he
 In recent years historians have revealed that Liddell Hart has distorted and falsified the facts to show that his ideas were adopted
 yuddh ke baad lidele heart ne apni swayan kii dharanaen thopi hai, ghatana ke baad, yah daawa karte hue ki vermact dwaara prayog kiya gaya mobile tanks yuddh kaushal unke prabhaav kaa nateeja tha, blitcraig swayan ek aadhikarik siddhant nahin he or haal ke samay main itihaaskaar is nattejey par pahunche hai ki yah us tarah se astitv main maujuud nahin tha: This was contrary to a theory
 blitcraig karravaayiyon kii ek sarakati hui chataan se bana tha jise dizin ke jariye kam or kamyaabi ke jariye adhik anjaam diya gaya tha
 In indirect terms - and with some help from Liddell Hart - the intense stream of action was squeezed as if it were not: an operational design
 "herpher or yukti se, lidele heart ne blitcraig ke nirmaan kii vaastavik paristhitiyon ko tod-marod diya tha or unhone isaki jadon ko dhundhala kar diya tha
 Through his non-theoretical idealization of a showy concept, he reinforced the myth of blitzkrieg "
 By retrospectively applying his self-conceptions of mobile warfare skills to the shallow concept of blitzkrieg, he" created a theoretical chaos
 Which took 40 years to clarify
 1950 ke dashak ke shuruaati sahitya ne blitcraig ko ek aitihaasik sainya siddhant main tabdeel kar diya tha, jisamen lidele heart or henge guderian ke hastakshar maujuud the
 The deceitful and "controversial" reports of Liddell Hart's history can be seen in his letters to relatives and colleagues of German generals Eric von Mänstein and Heinz Guderian, as well as Ervin Rommel
 patr ke liye Guderian main heart Liddell par uttararddh, sanskaran kii bamavarsha gadhe khud apane "lagaaya or use majaboor" karne ke liye mul sutara ke rup main yah prachaar

 In 1968, when Liddell Hart was asked a question about this and the discrepancy in the English and German versions of Guderian's memoirs, "he gave an easy, convenient, but very truthful answer
"
 pratham vishwa yuddh ke dauraan, fuller nav-viksit tanks sena ke saath jude ek staff adhikari the
 He later developed plans for extensive, independent tank operations, which he claimed were later studied by the German Army
 vividhtapurna tareeke se yah tark diya gaya tha ki fuller kii yuddh kaal kii yojanaayen or yuddh ke baad kii rachanaaen ek prerana thi, yaa yah ki unka pathak varg chota tha or yuddh ke dauraan hasil kiye gaye german anubhavon ne logon ko zyada aakarshith kiya
 The German people's view of themselves as the losing side of the war can be linked to senior and experienced officers through a thorough review, study and rewriting of all their military doctrines and training manuals
 britain kii pratikriya kahin adhik kamjor thi
 Both Fuller and Liddell Hart were "outsiders": Liddell Hart was unable to serve as an active soldier due to illness, and Fuller's strict personality resulted in his premature retirement in 1933
 isliye british sena ke aadhikarik padanukram ke andar unke vichaaron kaa simit prabhaav padaa tha
 The British War Office had on 1 May 1927 permitted the formation of an experimental mechanized army made up of tanks, loried infantry, self-propelled artillery troops, motorized engineers, but financial constraints prevented this experiment from being extended
 yah tark diya gaya he ki blitcraig nayaa nahin tha
 The Germans did not invent anything like the blitzkrieg in the 1920s and 1930s
 iske bajaay yuddh kii chalyman or kendrit sainya bal kii german avadharana ko prusia ke yudhon or german ekikaran ke yudhon main dekha ja saktaa he
 During the 30-year war, Swedish King Gustav II Adolfus was the first general to implement intense activity, concentrated power and integrated military effort
 The presence of tanks and aircraft in World War i is often seen as a radical change in military affairs), which allowed the German Army to revert to the traditional combat activities used by senior Moltec
 1939 se lagbhag 1942 tak kaa yah tathakthith "blitcraig abhiyaan" us oparation sambandhi sandarbh ke andar acchhee tarah maujuud tha
 At the outbreak of war, the German army did not have any fundamental new doctrine of war called blitzkrieg or anything else

 Harris and Robert M
 Cittino point out that the Germans had always given special priority to short, decisive campaigns
 yah sirf aisa tha ki ve aam taur par pratham vishwa yuddh kii paristhitiyon main chote-kram kii jeet hasil karne kaa prabandhan nahin kar sake
 fark is baat se padaa, pratham vishwa yuddh ke gatirodh ko dwitiya vishwa main jabardast shuruaati oparation sambandhi or ranneetik safalataa main badalanaa, jo yantricrut divijanon kii ek apekshaakrit choti sankhya kii niyukti thi, jisamen sabase mahatvapurn panjar divijanon kii niyukti or ek asaadhaaran shaktishaalee vaayu sena kaa sahyog shaamil tha
 Heinz Guderian is generally credited with formulating a military doctrine that was later interpreted as blitzkrieg
 haal hi main kuch logon ne yah andeh vyakt kiya he ki isamen unka kitna apana siddhant tha
 Following Germany's military reforms in the 1920s, Heinz Guderian emerged as a strong proponent of mechanized military forces
 parivahan sainikon ke nireekshanalay ke andar, guderian or unke sahakarmiyon ne saidhantik or maidani abhyaas kaa kaam apane haath main liya tha
 Guderian claimed that he faced opposition from many officers who had prioritized infantry or doubted the usefulness of the tank
 guderian ne daawa kiya tha ki unamem se ek general staff ke pramukh ladwig bek the, jinpar unhone is uljhan main hone kaa aarope lagaaya tha ki bakhtarband sainya bal nirnaayak hoga yaa nahin
 baad ke itihaaskaaron dwaara is daawey ko vivaadit bataaya gaya he
 For example, James Corum said: guderian ne 1935 se 1938 tak general staff ke pramukh ladwig bek ke liye hardik tiraskaar vyakt kiya tha, jinhen unhone ek aadhunik yantricrut yuddh kaushal ke vichaaron ke liye shatrutapurna bataaya tha: "ve jahaan bhi dikhaai die ek avarohak tatv the
 

 his way of thinking was his exaggerated way of fighting, which he called the delayed rescue
 yah ek behad sakasham general kaa ek ashuddh chithran he jinhone 1933 main army regulation 300 ko likhaa, jo dwitiya vishwa yuddh main german sena kaa praathmik samrik minial tha or jiske nirdesan ke tahat 1935 main pehle teen panjar divijanon ko taiyaar kiya gaya tha, jo us samay apni tarah kaa duniya kaa sabase bada sainya bal tha
 Another misconception raised by Guderian that he was the sole creator of the German strategic and operational system is also misleading
 1922 or 1928 ke bich guderian ne sainya gatividhiyon se sandarbh main mushkil se ek yaa do prishth ke kuch hi aalekh likhe the
 Guderian's Octang Panzer! Had fully relied on other theorists such as Ladwig Ritter von Eymansberger, whose major book, The Tank War, gained a wide readership in the German Army
 ek anya siddhantkaar, ernest volkem kaa bhi guderian dwaara prayog kiya gaya tha or tanks evam sanyukt hathiyaaron kii ranneetiyon par baari maatra main likhaa tha or jise guderian dwaara sweekaar nahin kiya gaya he
 Guderian's leadership was supported, encouraged and institutionalized by his supporters in the Rushwehr General Staff system, which helped the Army achieve greater levels of capability through extensive and systemic maneuver maneuvers in the 1930s
 
 guderian kaa tark he ki tanks yuddh kaa nirnaayak hathiyaar tha
 He wrote, "if the tanks were successful, victory would follow them"
 In an article addressed to critics of tank warfare, he wrote "until our critics prepare for a successful ground attack, in addition to self-genocide, something new and better way to attack a successful country other than self-genocide
 We don't, we have to maintain our belief that tanks - properly implemented, needless to say - are the best for ground attack today Plbd instrument
 pratham vishwa yuddh ke dauraan us tej raftaar se sambodhit karte hue, jise bachaav karne vaale kisi kshetra ko hamalavar dwaara bhed sakane kii tulana main adhik sudrudh bana saken, guderian ne likhaa ki "kyonki rigerv senaaon ko ab motoryukt kiya jayega, nae rakshaatmak morchon kaa nirmaan pehle kii tulana main kahin aasaan ho gaya he; topchi sainikon or paidal sena ke parsparik sahyog kii samay sarini ke aadhaar par akraman ke maukey, ek nattejey ke rup main, pichley yuddh main unki sthiti se aaj kahin halke hai
 He went on to say, "we believe that by attacking with tanks, we can achieve activity at a far higher rate than we have ever achieved and - possibly more important - that once success has been achieved So we can keep moving forward
 iske atirikt guderian ko yah aavashyaktaa mahasoos hui ki sabhi tinkon par ek-ek samrik radio kaa vyapak rup se istemaal kiya jaae jisase ki aapasi-sahyog or cmand kii suvidha hasil karne kii vyavastha kii jaae

 This includes the entirety of the poet's famous works 'aankar haath banate hain' and 'this paper is made for writing the words', so far, there are booklets coming out of the uncultivated - and many unpublished - poems
 ek saghan basaa kavita-sansar pathakon kii yayavari ko aamantrit kar rahaa he 
 On one side of these poems of Gyanendrapati, there is a revolutionary romance arising out of rapid change, class - Yutsu Udughosha, defying the enemies; On the other hand, there is that rare tone of social introspection which does not arise without raising one's soul to the lathe, which is possible only if it is sustained by its moral conscience
 yaheen, chetana pari or banani banerjee se hone vaali avismaraneey mulaakaaten hai 
 The child of a bats that wanders from dawn to night is also the source of this poem-world
 parityakt chijen bhi yahan nirarthak nahi, unamem naye arth ankhuaate he 
 As a matter of fact, reading Gyanendrapati is not just going to pass through the history, but listening to the melodious voice that comes from the clamor of the era is not heard from the history; It is a reading of the perpetuation of the eternal from the language of mortals
 isiilie yahan ek tarah kii angadhata kavy-saushthav kii avidhi thaharti he 
 It is an equitable hand extended towards human beings without the feast of high-profile critics
 ye ve kavitaayen hai jinaki jeevandharmita abujh dhang se maanviya jijeevishaa ko pusht karti he 
 The poet said: Gyanendrapati gyanendrapati hindi ke ek vilakshan kavi-vyaktitv hai, yah tathy ab nirvivaad he 
 The basis of the reputation of Gyanendrapati, who makes the life of poet-work, is not the number of awards and prizes to the institutions and the Mahajans, but the love of poetry-lovers, which his poetry kept on the fronts of life-struggle and 'the danger of expression 'earned by picking up
 ve un thode-se kaviyon main hai, jinke bal par, kavita kii taraf se janata kaa ji uchatane ke baavjood, samakaleen kavita ke sarthak swar kii vishwasaneeyata barkaraar he 
 One of the factors of the immaturity of the poetry of Gyanendrapati is the fact that his roots are deeply rooted in the mind of the world and his vision is world-conscious
 jivan-raag unki kavita main layaatmakataa main dhal jaataa he 
 He is not a poet, but a poet of the free throne Nirala proposed
 unki kavita aadyant chhandik aaveg se otprot he, balki uski sanrachana usee se nirdhaarit hoti he 
 Of course, each time it is an exploration of a new verse which is possible due to the unity of the poet-mind with the matter of life according to the poem's narrative
 hindi kii vishaal bhashik smapda kaa sarthak sandohan bhi unke yahaan khub ban pada he 
 Being limited is not compulsion of his poetry, for him neither untouchable nor indigenous untouchable; His adventurousness of producing new words is known to the extent of being notorious
 gyanendrapati kii kavita ek or to choti-se-choti sachaai ko, halki-se-halki anubhuti ko, sahejane kaa jatan karti he praani-maatr ke harsh-vishaad ko dhaaran karti he; duusari ore janamat bhoomi par dridhtaa se paanv rope satta-chaalit itihaas ke jhuthe sach ke mukaabil hoti he 
 Religious authority or political power - it does not spare anyone
 uski deeth pa santapt bhugol he 
 She recognizes the new pantheons of the empire
 abhaya main pagi hooi karunaa use viraasat main mili he 
 She is the culmination of a great tradition

 Without doubt, our society's time is to see poetry with an eye - a compulsory book for those who want to understand it - not companion! maanav kii chetana yatra main sadiyon se hamaare saath ek durghatana hoti aayi he
 yah durghatana he - hamaara kisi vichaardhaara vishesh ke samarthak ke rup main ubharna

 kavita beshak apane samay se jujhakar hasil kii jaati he, lekin vah us kaal – khand se keelit nahin hoti, uski bhavishyonmukhataa hi uski na murajhaane vaali naveenta kaa baaise hoti he
” The group of humans who claim to have come out of the tamas of the past, digging the earth at their fingertips, when the earth's earth - body trembles with the atomic bomb's underground test - the Gyanendrapati stands up to question the future - “main poochta hoon Is this earth only yours? kya tumhen Going to an earthworm prithvi ko urvar karne main tallin kentue ke paas Should not ask prithvi ke bare main koi bhi ahm faisla lene se pehle ! Who knows, ants are worried more than you about the future of the Earth! meri haisiyat ek kentue kii ho May i have the right to be crushed like an ant meraa maanavadhikaar tumhaare daanavadhikaar ke aage naacheez ! i am right for you chalo, tumhaare hi khet kii – or lo, sachmuch kii – My right on this earth tumse kam to nahin” When the ego of our country, religion, caste and civilization - culture starts speaking in us and we are dying to kill for this reason only then we stop seeing that some of our beloved traditions are dying
 Huh
 Seeing the curtain of "ramlila" from our lives, it fell forever and especially in the era when "ram devotees" were taking out Ramrath with Ramshilas
 The feeling of suffering of the demise of "ramlila" is clearly seen in a few lines of "hey Ram" - “nikal rahaa tha ramrath, desh ko dophaad karata – sa Ramsilas were landing in the villages fluttering their vultures or udhar, andekhee Ramlila was dying gaanv main maheene – bhar dati rahanevaali ramlilaayen xxrep 12

 While working for Mark Aurelio, Fellini also began writing film reviews with a radio metaphor

 But his film Vittelloni in 1953 was heartily received by critics and audiences

 As a screenwriter and film director, Fellini has acted in the following films: felini ne apni sarvatha bhinn film nirmaan style se apane samakalinon ko prabhavit kiya

 francisi kranti france ke itihaas kii rajnatik or saamaajik uthal-puthal evam amul parivartan kii avadhi thi jo 1789 se 1799 tak chali
 Later, Napoleon Bonaparte carried this revolution to some degree by the expansion of the French Empire

 This revolution changed the direction of modern history
 isse vishwa bhar main nirpeksh rajtantr kaa hraas hona shuru hua, naye ganatantr ev udaar prajatantra bane
 In the modern era, the state revolution of France proved to be the most dramatic and complex in which the Western civilization shook Western civilization
 is kranti ne keval france ko hi nahin apitu samast europe ke jan-jivan ko ast-vyast kar diya
 The French Revolution has been called a milestone in the history of the entire world
 is kranti ne anya europea deshon main bhi swatantrata kii lalak kaayam kii or anya desh bhi rajshahi se mukti ke liye sangharsh karne lage
 This created an atmosphere against monarchy and autocracy in Asian countries, including European nations
 france main nirankush rajtantr tha jo rajtv ke daivi siddhanth par aadhaarit tha
 In this the king had unlimited rights and the king was arbitrary
 lui 14wein ke shasankaal main nirankushta apni paraakaashtha par thi
 He said- "I am the state"

 He made excessive centralization of power in favor of monarchy

 In this way he made the monarchy a serious profession

 Despite this, the Palace of Versailles remained a center of luxury
 usne kaha ki mere baad pralay hogi
 Louis was the ruler of the 16th on the eve of the revolution
 vah ek akarmanya or ayogy shaasha tha
 He too exhibited demeanor and autocracy
 usne kaha ki "yah cheez isliye kanoonee he ki yah main chahta hum
 "at the time of resignation of one of his ministers, he said - i wish i could resign

 Which was hereditary

 Thus the system of governance was completely corrupt, autocratic, passive and exploitative
 vyaktigat kanoon or raja kii ichha kaa hi kanoon lagu hota tha
 As a result, there was a lack of uniform law code in the country and prevalence of different laws in different areas
 is avyavasthit or jatil kanoon ke kaaran janata ko apane hi kanoon kaa gyaan nahin tha
 The existence of this disorganized autocratic and sensitive governance system became painful for the people
 in utpeedak raajnneetik paristhitiyon ne kranti kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Regarding France's chaotic situation, u can be said that "there was no question of bad system, there was no system at all
" " The causes of the revolution can also be seen under social conditions
 francisi samaaj visham or vighatit tha
 That society was divided into three classes / states
 pratham stats main padri varg, dwitiya stats main kuleen varg evam tritiy stats main jansadharan shaamil tha
 The clergy and the nobility enjoyed wide privileges while the public was devoid of authority
 kisaanon kii sankhya sarvaadhik thi or inaki dasha nimna or sochneey thi
 The peasants had to pay many taxes to the state, the church and other zamindars and the feudal tyrants had to bear
 ek drushti se kisaanon ke asantosh kaa mukhya kaaran saamanton dwaara die ja rahe ksht evam asuvidhaayen thi or rajtantr is par chuppi saadhe hue tha
 In this way, the peasants had become so grieved that they themselves turned into a revolutionary element and they needed only a sign to make revolution
 madhyam varg main sahukaar vyapaaree, shikshak, vakil, doctor, lekhak, kalakaar, karmchaaree aadi sammilit the
 His economic condition was certainly right, yet he was angry with the political, social and economic conditions of the time
 is varg ko koi raajnneetik adhikaar praapt nahin tha or padri or kuleen varg kaa vyavhaar inke prati acha nahin tha
 For this reason the middle class hated the social superiority of the nobles and was willing to change the political system and get their rights
 yahi kaaran tha ki france kii kranti main unka mukhya yogadan rahaa or unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 There were also some economic complaints from the middle class
 purv ke vaanijya vyapaar ke kaaran is varg ne dhansampatti arjeet kar lee thi kintu ab saamanti vaataavaran main unke vyapaar par kai tarah ke pratibandh lage the jagah-jagah chungi deni padati thi
 They wanted a free environment for their trade business
 iske liye unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 In this way we can say that the French Revolution was the result of the struggle of two conflicting factions of French society
 ek taraf raajnneetik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee or duusari taraf aarthik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee varg the
 To dominate the politics and government of the country, struggle between these two classes was inevitable
 is tarah 1789 kii francisi kranti, francisi samaaj main asamanta ke viruddh sangharsh thi
 The economic condition of France was in trouble

 In fact the royal treasury was emptied due to the extravagance of the kings of France and the frequent wars of Louis the 14th

 An excessive amount of the state was spent on the emperor, empress and his family

 On the other hand the tax system was unsatisfactory

 In this way the state of the treasury had become extremely thoughtful

 The state was burdened with debt

 The country's economic malpractices could be improved by encouraging trade commerce, but the government's commercial policy was so uncontrolled and flawed that it did not make possible the development of production and trade in the state
 lui 16wein ne turgon, nekar jaise vitt salaahkaaron ke madhyam se aarthik sankat ko dur kanane kaa prayaas kiya lekin ye sudhaar prayaas lagu nahin ho sake kyonki visheshadhikaar praapt varg ne apane upar kar lagane kii baat sweekaar nahin kii
 The demand for a meeting of the estate general was eventually called for passing resolutions for the abolition of privilege, and the revolution coincided with the meeting of the estate general in 1789, so the economic plight of the time was considered the most important cause of the French Revolution is
 francisi kranti main darshanikon kii bhoomika ke sandarbh main do mat saamne aate hai-ek, darshanikon ne kranti kii paristhitiyon ko janm dekar kranti ko utpann kiya or doosraa kranti kaa strot to us samay ke rashtriya jivan ke dosha main tathaa sarkaar kii bhuulon main tha or darshanikon ne kranti utpann nahin kii
 It would be desirable to understand the views of those philosophers and their relationship with the revolution before passing judgment on any opinion
 darshanikon ke vichaaron kii lokapriyata kaa nirdhaaran to us samay unke chape lekhon ke sanskarnon or prasar ke aadhaar par dekha janaa chahie
 Montescue in his book 'the Spirit of Laws' contradicted the principles of the king's divine rights and offered not only a critique of French political institutions but also an alternative
 usne likhaa ki francisi sarkaar nirkunsh sarkaar he kyonki france main karypalika, nyaaypalika or vidhayika sambandhi sabhi shaktiyaan ek hi vyakti arthath raja ke haathon main kendrit he isliye france kii janata ko swatantraaa praapt nahin he
 It was in this context that he gave the principle of "separation of power", according to which the three principal organs of governance, the executive, the judiciary and the administrator, were advised to be placed in separate hands
 usne england ke saraakar ko adarsh bataaya kyonki vahaan sanvaidhanik rajtantr tha jisase vahaan nagarikon ko swatantraaa thi
 Thus his ideas that Montescue hurt France's autocratic state system through segregation of power became so popular that six editions were published in three years of 'the Spirit of Lodges'
 yahaan dhyaan rakhane kii baat yah he ki montescue ne na to kranti kii baat kii or na hi rajtantr ko samaapt karne kii usne to sirp nirankush rajtantr ke dosha ko ujagar kiya or sanvaidhanik rajtantr kii baat kii
 Voltaire illustrated the liberal politics, religion and freedom of thought of Britain through his book Letters on English and compared it to the ancient French system and noted the evils and shortcomings prevalent in France
 pratibandhit hone se purv ye pustaken bahut lokapriy hui thi
 "voltaire" wrote against the Church's corrupt pickles, intolerance, injustice, oppression and tyranny

 He wrote that crush the notorious and infamous thing

 Waltair wanted to establish a similar rule in France, in line with the constitutional monarchy of England
 usne kaha ki main sau chuhon ke sthaan par ek singh kaa shashan pasand karata hoon
 Voltaire did not speak of revolution but laid the background for freedom of thought
 usne puraatan francisi vyavastha kii buraaiyon ko ujagar kiya
 He presented to the people the mirror of the erstwhile French society and said that the mirror is called a stain
 ruso ne apni pustak “emily”, “soshal contract”, “rusoni” ke madhyam se manushya kii swatantraaa kii baat kii
 It said that despite being born free of human beings, everyone is chained with chains
 in zanjeeron se mukti paane kaa ek hi tarika he ki ham prakritik aadim avasthaa kii ore laute
 The Russians said that it is the compulsory and universal duty of a state made by collective will to conduct the work considering the whole society as paramount
 jin logon ko karypalika shakti saupin gai he ve janata ke swami nahin uske kaaryakari he, or unka kartavya janata kii ajna kaa paalan karnaa he
 In this way he firmly believed that the paramount power should be in the hands of the public and not in the hands of any individual or institution
 saarvbhaum satta janata kii ichha main nihit he jise “saamaanya ichha” kaha gaya
 The law of the state should be an expression of this common desire, but the nature of the law is no longer such, but it is dependent on the will of the ruler
 ruson ne bhi kranti kii baat nahin kii lekin sabhi vyakti ko swatantra evam samaan mana or francisi kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav usee ke vichaaron se prabhavit the
 Napoleon acknowledged his importance and said that if there had not been the Russians, there would not have been a revolution in France

 The French scholar Didro is credited with compiling the works of the best thinkers of the 18th century and bringing them to the general public

 The French government considered the Daiders to be its greatest enemy and imposed several restrictions on his book

 He argued that only land is the primary source of all wealth

 By the time of the 16th, the French financial system had sunk into debt
 america swatantraaa sangram ne france ke divaaliepan par muhar laga di
 Therefore, in order to overcome the economic distress, the help of economists like Turks, Necker, Cologne took
 colon ne visheshadhikaar praapt kuleen varg par kar lagane kaa suzav diya jise kulinon ne asweekaar kar diya
 The meeting of the States General was finally called

 All classes were excited to hear the news of the meeting of the States General
 kulina ummid thi ki is baithak main ve un visheshadhikaron ko praapt kar sakenge jo lui 14waan ke samay usne chhin liye gaye the
 The people of the middle class believed that they would be able to formulate progressive policies in their favor
 kisaanon ko aashaa thi ki vah saamanti visheshadhikaron ke viruddh aawaaj uthaakar apane adhikaron ko surakshit kar unke shoshan chakra se mukt ho sakenge
 In this way no significant portion of the French population was ready to support the French monarchy
 estats general ke adhiveshan main matadhikaar paddati ke mudde par tritiy state evam anya state ke bich vivaad ho gaya
 Voting was said that each state would be considered to have only one vote
 is prakaar visheshadhikaar praapt varg kaa do tathaa jansadharan kaa ek hi mat hota he
 Representatives of the general public, ie 'third State' opposed this voting system because it would have reduced them to a minority even though they were many
 tritiy state yah chahta tha ki teenon shreniyon ke pratinidhi ek saath baithkar bahumat se nirnay le lekin padri evam kuleen varg alag-alag baithak chaahate the
 Therefore, the Third State boycotted the meeting of the States General and declared itself as a national assembly, representing the entire nation and convened its meeting in the nearby tennis court

 From the point of view of convenience of the study, the revolution can be seen by dividing it into the following four stages
 is charan main paris kii bheed ne bastil ke kile par niyantran sthapit kiya
 This is how the revolution started
 vastutah bastil kaa kila nirankushta evam atyaachaar kaa pratik tha or iske patan se puraatan vyavastha kaa gahari chunauti mili
 The incident also affected the rural areas of France and the villagers set fire to the records of feudal taxes

 So, on 4 August 1789, an overnight session of the National Assembly took place in which all the privileges were abolished by framing laws
 is tarah england or america ko samaapt kar diya gaya
 The important function of the National Assembly was to create a constitution
 atah rashtriya sabha hi samvidhan sabha kahalaayi or 26 agast 1789 ko samvidhan sabha ne maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 The Constituent Assembly declared human rights as its ideals and objectives
 is ghoshnaa main samanta ke siddhanth par bal diya gaya or kaha gaya ki chunki sabhi manushya samaan rup se paidaa hote he atah unhen samaan adhikaar milane chahie
 These rights included freedom, property security and the right to protest against tyranny etc
 is prakaar samvidhan sabha ne aadharbhoot siddhanton, swatantraaa, samanta va janata ke prabhutv kii ghoshnaa kii
 The right to property was repeated in the manifesto
 is adhikaar se kisi ko vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 The National Constituent Assembly seized church property and attempted to reduce the church's control over the public
 is sandarbh main carch ko rajya ke adheen le aayaa gaya or use rome ke pope ke prabhaav se mukt kar rashtriya carch ke rup main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 a "civil Constitution of Clergy" was created to secure the clergy's loyalty to the state
 jiske anusaar padariyon ko rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath leni padati thi or janata ke dwaara unka chunaav hota tha
 The pope and some priests opposed the move
 jin padariyon ne rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath grahan ki ve “jurar” kehalaae jabaki shapath nahin lene vaale “non jurar” kehalaae
 This law created an atmosphere against the revolution because so far the small clergy had supported the revolution
 ab ve isse alag ho gaye or kuch padri desh chhod videshon main chale gaye or vahaan europe main kranti ke viruddh prachaar karne lage
 The National Constituent Assembly prepared a written constitution for France, and this constitution was approved by Louis XVI in 1791
 samvidhan main do baton par bal diya gaya-ek, rajya kii saarvbhaum shakti janata main nihit he or doosraa, shakti kaa pruthakkaran rajya evam janata ke hit main he
 Although the system of governance remained monarchical, the king's powers were limited

 The king did not have the right to make war or treaty with any country

 The citizens were divided into two parts, active and inactive, for the election of members of the administration and the franchise was given only to the active citizens

 The National Assembly changed the administrative structure of France
 pracheen praanto ko khatm karke sampoorn desh ko 83 departmenton main vibhakti kiya gaya
 These departments were divided into Cantan and Comune
 prayek ikaiyon kaa shashan chalaane ke liye nirvachan parishad hoti thi jiskaa chunaav sakriy naagarik karte the
 In this way, the entire state system from the local level to the central level came to the Barja class

 Radicals were also divided into two classes - Jirondist and Jacobian
 isi bich france kii kranti kaa bhay europe ke anya deshon ke bhi failane laga
 The clergy and oligarchs who had fled from France to other regions of Europe spread the spirit against the revolution
 duusari taraf france ke krantikari anya deshon main bhi krantikari siddhanton ko prachaar chaah rahe the
 As a result, other kings of Europe became suspicious
 parinamswaroop krantikari france or europe ke anya deshon kaa aapasi sambandh bigadaa
 Austria, despite the refusal of the revolutionaries, had allowed the refugees of the French monarchy to remain with them
 atah vyavasthapika sabha ne apairal 1792 i
 main austria ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di, kintu france kii sena buree tarah parajeet hui
 The defeat convinced the French people that the king had told Austria all the secrets of France's military power and security
 atah raja ke prati janata kaa ravaiya ugr ho gaya
 In these conditions, in support of the French monarchy, Prasha and Austria declared that the French people should obey the king, otherwise we will take action against them
 is tarah france kii kranti ne europe main yuddh kii sthiti utpann kii
 The announcement made the people of France more enraged and surrounded the king
 raja bhagkar vyavasthapika sabha kii sharan main pahunchaa
 It was now considered that the assembly should be dissolved; a re-election takes place, a new administrative assembly is formed and it gives its decision on the future of monarchy
 isi ke saath vyavasthapika sabha ko samaapt kar diya gaya or vayask matadhikaar ke aadhaar par rashtriya kanveshan kaa gathan hua
 The first session of the National Convention was held on 21 September 1792
 isamen jacobiyan evam jirodist dal pramukh the
 The Jacobians were disciplined and organized
 paris kii bheed par inkaa prabhaav tha
 The main leaders in this were - Dante, Robspier, Heater, etc
 duusari taraf jirondist the- ye shikshit or susanskrit log the
 He had more book knowledge
 faltah ye vyaavhaarik raajnneetijna nahin the
 The prominent leaders were - Isnar, Madame Roland, Brisco etc
 yahaan samajhane kii baat yah he ki donon hi gut ganatantr ke himachati the, videshi shaktiyon ke viruddh yuddh kaa samarthan karte the
 The difference was only in form
 vastutah jirodisto ne france main udaaravaadi sthaan grahan kar liya tha
 He believed that the revolution had gone far ahead and should end
 ve or adhik saamaajik samanta laane ke viruddh the
 He emphasized more on freedom
 udhar jacobiyan log samanta par adhik jor dete the tathaa nimna virgon ke prati sadbhaavpurn ravaiya rakhte the
 The National Convention had three major problems - foreign invasion, the king's presence, and civil war
 sitambar 1792 main francisi sena ne belgium par adhikaar kar liya or dakshin main nise or sevoy bhi uske adhikaar main aa gaye
 Holland, Austria, Prasha and England were terrified by these victories
 krantikariyon ne 1792 main ghoshnaa bhi kar di ki france kaa ganatantr swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kii bhaawanaaon par aadhaarit he or in bhaawanaaon kaa prasar karnaa vah apana kartavya samajhataa he
 France will implement revolutionary principles and seize the property of priests and nobles in the places where it will dominate and whichever country opposes it will be considered as the revolution
 is ghoshnaa se europe ke nirankush rajtantri desh bhaybheet ho gaye or ab france kii kranti france kii na hokar puure europe kii ho gai
 Therefore, the European countries united to stop the spread of revolution and a faction of England, Holland, Austria, Prussia was formed against France
 is gut ne kai jagahon par france ko parajeet kiya
 Consequently, France's defeat in a foreign war became a major problem before the National Convention
 neshnal kanvension ne ek prastaav paarit kar rajtantr ko samaapt kiya or ganatantr kii sthapana kii
 The king was tried for treason and sentenced to death
 raja ke vadh ke prashn par jirondixton kii niti spasht nahin thi
 He was opposed to the monarchy but was referring to the referendum on the question of slaughter
 iske vipareet jacobiyans kaa mat tha ki raja kaa deshadroh siddh ho chukaa he
 Therefore, he should be given death sentence
 atantah 21 janvari 1793 ko lui 16waan faansee par chadha diya gaya
 The National Convention also faced the problem of conflict between the Jacobians and the Zirodists
 vastutah yuddh ke kaaran france aarthik sankat se ghir gaya tha, keemten bad gai thi jisase kanveshan ne raahat dene ke liye vidhaan banaaya, amiron se karj vasuulne kaa niyam banaaya
 These steps were opposed by the Jirandists
 jab jacobio ne paris kii bheed or commune kii sahaayta se kanvension par akraman kar satta par adhikaar kiya or jirondixto ko giraftaar kar aatank ke rajya kii sthapana kii
 With the establishment of the 'state of Terror', France once again fell into disarray
 robspier ke netritv main isaki sthapana kii gai thi
 In this revolutionary, public security was established and anyone who worked against the Jacobs would be punished with death penalty
 robspier ruson kii vichaardhaara se prabhavit tha
 According to which "common desire" is universal desire
 robspier ne satta par niyantran rakhane ke liye virodhiyon ko “gilotin” par chadha diya
 So all the people became suspicious about their lives
 antat july 1794, main robspier kaid kar liya gaya or faansee de di gai isi ke saath aantak ke rajya kii samaapti hui
 The 'state of Thermidorians' was followed by the state of terror
 udaaravaadi thermidorian netaaon ne desh kii satta sanbhali or aantak rajya kii vyavasthaaon ko bhang kiya, jacobiyans ko avaidh ghoshit kiya
 During the rule of terror, control over the price and remuneration imposed was lifted
 jisase keemten punah bad gai, sattebaajon kaa prabhaav bad gaya or pratikriya swaroop vidroh hue lekin in vidronho ko dabaa diya gaya
 Phase III-1794-99 - Rule of "directory" In fact the National Convention formulated a constitution and entrusted the executive responsibility to the 5-member "board of Directors"
 mandal ke sabhi sadasyon ke adhikaar baraabar the
 Each member alternately presided for three months
 prayek varsh ek sadsy kaarykaal samaapt hona tha or uske badale duusare sadsy kii niyukti kii jaani thi
 In this way, the Directory of Rule in France began after the National Convention which lasted from 1795 to 1799
 atan main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar diya
 This directory rule was disorganized, sad
 sanchaalak mandal ko sashastr senaaon ke niyantran evam senadhyakshon kii niyukti, france kii ore se sandhi karne yaa yuddh karne ke adhikaar praapt the
 The main problem before the Board of Directors was the problem of war, on the other hand the members of the directory were inexperienced, inept and corrupt
 atah diarectory ke shashan kaal main tarah-tarah kii gadabadi faili, bekaari badi, vyapaar thapp pad gaya or uski videsh niti bhi kamjor rahi

 is samay hamaare saamne yah prashan uthta he ki 1789 i
 main kranti kaa sutrapat anya europe deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi kyon hui
 a study of European nations of the 18th century showed that the condition of France at that time was worse than that of other Europe nations
 nirankush rajtantr suvidha yukt varg or karon ke asaahneey bhaar se dabaa hua tha
 Ordinary classes were present in almost all European countries
 kuch rajyon kii sthiti to france se bhi adhik vikrut thi prasha, austria or rus aadi france se bhi adhik vikrut the
 French farmers were happier than other European nations
 saadhaaran varg kii sthiti anya europe rajyon main or bhi kharaab thi
 Nevertheless, the revolution took place not in these countries but in France first
 iskaa pramukh kaaran yah tha kii france log apni sthiti ke prati jaagruk the
 It is not a necessary condition for revolution that its explosion takes place in the same countries where people are victims of atrocities, incest and exploitation

 There were many reasons for this revolution which are as follows
 frasisi saamanton kaa badla hua swarup or kisaano kii unnat avasthaa- Such was the reason for the advanced state of French peasants and the changed nature of feudalism
 jiske chalate france main sarv pratham rajyakranti hui
 Farmers in the European country were still in a state of gloom
 parantu france ke kisaan swatantra ho chuke the
 They did not own their own land and own their own land in spite of such convenience and feudal services, they had to pay a large part of their income in the form of feudal tax
 or phir bhi uski sthiti acchhee dhi
 They used to buy some land by saving money and the hunger to buy land was constantly increasing, there was a problem of feudalism and unemployment, so they were thinking of removing the feudal occupations, so they got strength under the leadership of the middle class
 And in 1789 AD they revolted
 france main udaar nirankushta kii parampara kaa abhaav- Other European countries also had autocratic monarchies
 parantu vahaan ke samraaton ne samaynusaar apni nirankushta main kami kar di thi
 King Fredirak of Prasha was the great enlightened administrator of his time
 jiskaa anusaran europe ke anya desh rus germany, italy, spain aadi ne kiya
 In due course of time, he tried as much as possible to improve the economic, physical and other fields
 parantu france main is tarah ki udaar nirankushta kaa abhaav tha
 The kings there were doing nothing for the benefit of the people
 balki adhik tex vasulanaa or janata kaa shoshan karnaa unki niti ban gai thi
 Therefore, the French people were fed up with it, so the people of France wanted to end the autocratic monarchy
 maadyam varg kii jaagarukta- The reason for the first revolution in France was the middle class there
 anya deshon main bhi madhyam varg thi parantu ve france kii tarah saanskriti, dhani evam shikshit nahin the
 He lacked strength
 ve raja ke khilaaf baghawat karne kii soch nahin sakate the
 The middle class people in France were dissatisfied with their emperors for many reasons
 or apni raksha ke liye raaj satta par ankush lagane ke liye utawala ho rahe the
 Other European states lacked this type of situation
 anya deshon main netritv karne vaala koi nahin tha france main jaagruk madhyamvarg taiyaar tha
 Therefore, revolution first took place in France itself
 kulinvarg kii anupayogita- The elite Vigyan was given the first privilege to help the king in running the rule
 or ve janaata kii raksha bhi karte the
 But slowly - 2 started doing this work for the king's employees
 falat: kulinon kii upyogita samaapt ho gai

 Who presented the psychological basis of the revolution
 unhone samaaj main vaypt buraaiyon kii ore logon kaa dhyaan aakrisht karaayaa or muk janata ko vaani di
 Such an attempt was not being made in other countries
 montegu, waltare ruso aadi vichaarkon kaa kaary kshetra france hi tha
 Austria, Prasha and Russia did not have such thinkers
 europe ke anya deshon main logon kaa unki vaastavik sthiti bataane vaala or unamem santosh paidaa karne vaala darshanikon kaa koi varg nahin tha
 This was a major reason for revolution in France itself
 raajnneetik sahabhaagita kaa abhaav- When the middle class became aware in England, they were given the opportunity to participate in the politics of the country
 parantu france ke saath aisi baat nahin thi
 The middle class of France was quite dissatisfied with its emperors
 unki apeksha kii jaati thi
 Despite being educated, they did not have a reputation like the nobles
 unhen france kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar nahin diya jaataa tha
 Therefore, he dissented and raised the slogan of revolution
 ayogy raja tathaa prashasan main bhrashtachar- The political system of France was centralized but the kings were inept
 prashasan main bhrashtachar kaa bolbalaa tha
 In other countries of Europe, autocratic rule was broken but kings were eligible and they had full control over governance
 france kaa madhyam varg is prashasnic bhrashtatar ko mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 And so he was ready to revolt
 rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai- At this time, national sentiment began to rise rapidly in Europe
 sampoorn europe main france hi ek aisa desh tha jahaan ek raashtra bhaavana kaa purnat: abhaav tha
 Due to this, there was a revolution in France for the first time
 america swatantraaa sangram kaa prabhaav- The American War of Independence started in 1766 AD
 gimen america ke logon ne england ke khilaaf vidroh kar kar diya
 The soldiers of France also got an opportunity to participate in this freedom struggle, so they felt that freedom can be achieved through war
 unhone yah bhi anubhav kiya ki swatantraaa so hi sukh kii prapti sambhav he
 On returning to France, he saw that the freedom he fought for in America is the complete lack of freedom in France
 at: ve yahan kii kranti ke liye baichaiyn ho uthe or yuddh ke dwaara swatantraaa praapt karne kii cheshtaa karne lage
 This was not the case in other countries of Europe

 shashan vyavastha kii drushti se bhi france kaa shashan atyadhik suvyavasthit tha
