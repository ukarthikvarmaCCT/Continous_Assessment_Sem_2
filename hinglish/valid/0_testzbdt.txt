 pracheen china main buddha dharm ke pehle kai mahaan rajwanshon kaa dharm prachlit tha
 One of them was the Sha Dynasty, dating back to 2070 BC
 sha vansh se pehle china main teen adhipatiyon or paanch samraaton kaa kaal tha
 The last of the five emperors was Emperor Shun
 shun ne apni gaddi yu mahaan ko saunpi or usee se sha rajvansh satta main aayaa
 It was also called the Shia dynasty followed by the Shang dynasty, which lasted from 1600 BCE to 1046 BCE
 shang rajvansh ke baad china main jhou rajvansh satta main aayaa
 If seen globally, Confucius thought in China during the time of Gautama Buddha, Vedic and Buddha thought in India and Zarathustra ideology in Iran, the rest of the world was almost non-existent except Greece
 na isai dharm tha or na islam
 Before the birth of Jesus Christ, the echo of Buddhism had reached Jerusalem
 china main jhou rajvansh kaa kaal lambey samay tak chalaa
 During these times, Confucian thought and Buddhism developed in China
 baad main tao vaad, mohivaad or nyaayawad bhi khub phala-phula
 But in the midst of all this, Buddhism had its roots and it tied different ideologies of China in one thread
 buddha dharm ke kaaran china main jatigat ekta or shakti kaa vikaas hua
 The spread of this ideology led to the rise of the Chin Dynasty with the abolition of slavery in China
 chhin ke baad haan ne 8veen sadi tak rajya kiya
 In the earlier period of development of all these dynasties and religion and philosophy, China was named Harivarsha
 bhartiya dharmagranthon ke anusaar use harivarsh kaha jaataa tha
 King Agnighra of Jambudeep had 9 sons - Navel, Kimpurush, Harivarsha, Ilavrita, Ramya, Hiranyamay, Kuru, Bhadrashava and Ketumal
 raja agnighra ne un sab putron ko unke naam se prasiddh bhukhand diya
 Harivarsha got part of present-day China, which according to ancient geography was a part or year of the Jambudweep

 Buddhism, however, entered China by 200 BC through monks
 sambhavat: usase purv, lekin raajaaon ke madhyam se yah vyapak paimaane par pehali shatabdi ke aasapaas china kaa rajdharm banane kii sthiti main aa gaya tha
 Gradually Buddhism led to the establishment of national unity in China

 Most of the people of Tai caste, Bulang caste, Achhang caste and Wa caste are also followers of Buddhist religion in Pali language which number more than 1 million
 haan bhashi buddha dharm ke anuyaayi haan jati ke log hai or puure desh main faile hue hai
 At present, there are 28 thousand Buddhist monasteries and more than 16 thousand Buddhist viharas in native China and the number of Buddhist schools and colleges is 33 and the number of religious newspapers and magazines is about 50

 bhavanipur har singh, lalkuan tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke nainital jile kaa ek gaanv he
 a pump is a mechanical device used to push and displace gases and liquids
 duusare shabdon main, pump taral ko kam daab ke sthaan se adhik daab ke sthaan par dhakelne kaa kaam karata he
 Pumps have been used since time immemorial to treat water filled, or flowing, to lift water to a higher level
 aadhunik yug ke vividh kaaryakshetron main naanaa prakaar ke taral padaarthon kaa udanchan karke unhen sthanantarit karne ke liye ek vishesh saadhan kaa anivaaryat: upyog karnaa padataa he, jise pump kehete hai
 The following are the measurement measures and definitions of pumps: sthitik chushanotthapan - koi pump kisi drav ko use praathmik tal se jitna unchaa uthaa saktaa he vah oonchaai us pump kaa chushanotthapan kehalaati he
 It flows from the top floor of the fluid to the midline of the pump's cylinder in the fluid store
 chushan sheersh - jab pump ko uske sthitik chushanotthapan ke tal se neeche lagaaya jaataa he, tab upar bache hue utthapanaansh ke anupaat se chushan nal main taral padaarth kii jo kuch daab hogi vah chushan sheersh kehalaati he
 Static Exhaust Head - The vertical distance of the open mouth of the exhaust tap from the midline of the cylinder to the pump is called the static exhaust head
 gharshan sheersh - taral padaarth ke nishkasana se sambandh rakhanevaale pampiya nalon main jo pravaahajanit dharshan hota he, uske pratirodh samatulyashirsh ko gharshan sheersh kehete hai
 Vegative Heads - The number of vertices required as pressure to maintain the flow of fluid in the drainage tubes is called the peaked head
 sampurna sthitik sheersh - drav sangraahak main drav ke upree tal ke nikaas nal ke munh tak kii sampurna urdhwadhar duuri ko sampurna sthitik sheersh kehete hai
 Composite Head - The difference between the pressure on the suction door and the exit door is called composite head
 jab kisi pump ko lagane kii yojana banaai jaati he tab uparyukt sabhi shirshon kii maatra par vichaar karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Positive displacement pump - The positive displacement pump absorbs a certain amount of fluid and displaces it into the discharge pipe
 kuch dhanatmak visthaapan pump chushan paksh par ek vistaar guha or nirvahan taraf ghatate guha kaa upyog karte hai
 As the cavity expands on the suction side, fluid flows into the pump and the liquid comes out of the cavity where the cavity size is low and the pressure is high
 aaparishan ke prayek chakra me taral ki di gai maatra sthir hoti he
 No fluid can automatically flow from the bottom to the top of the pump until the air or vapor of the fluid is removed from the suction system, so that the inward pressure is reduced from the outside pressure
 chaalu kiye jane par pratyaagaamee pump or ghurni pump swat: aisi paristhiti utpann kar dete hai, kintu apkendri pump aisa nahin kar sakate
 They require that the liquid to be pumped up to their first petal, only then they can accelerate the fluid through centrifugal water and cause it to flow
 isi kaaran unhen dhanatmak udwah par lagaana aavashyak ho jaataa he, lekin aisa karnaa vyavhaar main sadaiv saadhy nahin hota
 Therefore, the applications used to vacuum the air etc
 from their suction tap are called deprecation applications
 kai panpon main is prakaar kii prayuktiyaan usee ke mukhya ang main bani hoti hai
 For this reason they are called self-determination pumps
 kai panpon main ye alag se lagaai jaati athwa kii jaati hai
 In many pumps, this is done with an evaporator and in many with an electrically operated vacuum pump, which is run by leasing from the motor of the same pump
 is prakaar ke nirvatak kaa prayog karte samay pump kii dhuree main kuch antaraal rakhaa jaataa he, kyonki jab tak chushan pranali kii sari hawa nahin nikal jaati tab tak pump ke pakhe ko vyarth hi sookhaa chalanaa padataa he
 These instruments are also of three types, first piston reciprocating, second fixed functional rotary type, which are in the form of separate fans, and third, coil winding fluid, which needs to be filled with some water in their coil before starting
 19veen sadi main bana netherlands se ek deazal pump 'П3' three-cylinder diving pump made in Soviet Union in 1977 gharelu kendriya taapan pump Double pump diophants naamak unani ganitagya ne, jo sambhavat: isa ke pashchaat teesri shatabdi main rahaa, bahut se bahupadiy anirdharya samikarnon kaa adhyayan kiya tathaa purnankon main unke halon ko gyaat kiya
 But in the light of modern facts, there is no message now that Indian mathematicians had done very important work in this field long before Diophants
 diophanteey samasyaon main samikarnon kii sankhya charon kii sankhya se kam hoti he 
 The coefficients of the variables in these equations are integers and the integer values of the variables have to be obtained that satisfy these equations
 isliye un sabhi samikarnon kaa naam diophanteey sameekaran pad gaya jinamein charon ke gunank purnank hote hai
 Mathematical study of diophantic problems is now called diophantic analysis
 itihaas main harek diophanteey sameekaran ek bujuval kii tarah prayog kii jaati rahi hai kintu diophanteey samikarnon kaa saamaanya siddhanth beesvin shatee kii ek badi ganitiya uplabdhi maani jaati he
 The following questions are often considered in diophantic analysis - 800 isapurv se 500 isapurv rachit shulbasutron main diophanteey samikarnon kaa purnank hal miltaa he
 Around 800 BC, Boudhayan obtained the solution of simultaneous diophantic equations as a set of two positive integers
 unhone chaar agyaat raashiyon se yukt yugapat diophanteey samikarnon kaa hal nikaalane kii bhi koshish kii thi
 In 600 BC, Apastamb tried to solve the diophantic equations with 5 unknown sums
 ati pracheen kaal se hi bhartiya ganitagya a x + b y = c { \ displaystyle ax+by=c} prakaar ke samikarnon kaa purnank hal khojane kii disha main karyrat rahe hai
 Although nowadays they are called 'diophantic equations', but long before diophants there is a detailed discussion of such mathematical problems in the Shulbasutras
 shulbasutron kaa kaal 800 isapurv yaa usase bhi pehle he
 Aryabhata has named the solution of such problems as 'kuttak'
 bhaskar ne aryabhatiy kii tikaa main nimnlikhit kuttak diya he- Namely, carry out the integer n { \ displaystyle N} where n = 8 x + 5 = 9 y + 4 = 7 z + 1 { \ displaystyle n = 8x + 5 = 9y + 4 = 7z + 1}
 ise hal karne par n { \ displaystyle N} kaa maan 85 { \ displaystyle 85} aata he
 The word 'kuttak' literally means 'hearer'
 kuttak vidhi vastav main ek punaravarti vidhi he
 At present, this method, with interpretation by Bhaskar in 621 AD, is called 'aryabhata algorithm', which has become the standard method for solving first-degree diophantic equations
 isi prakaar, brahmagupta ne nimnlikhit anirdharya sameekaran ko hal kiya he: There is an entire chapter in Brahmagupta's book titled 'khandakhadyak' called 'kuttakadhyay'

 halanki us samay bharat sarkaar ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki bharat kaa parmaanu kaarykram shantipurna kaaryo ke liye hoga or yah pareekshan bharat ko urja ke kshetra main aatmanirbhar banane ke liye kiya gaya he
 Later on 11 and 13 May 1998, five more underground nuclear tests were conducted and India declared itself a nuclear power country
 is pareekshan ke pratikriya swarup pakistan ne bhi iske turant baad 28 may 1998 ko parmaanu pareekshan kiye
 Pakistan had to face condemnation after declaring itself a nuclear-powered nation when Pakistan's nuclear scientist Abdul Qadir Khan, believed to be the father of the Pakistani nuclear program, sold secret nuclear technology to Libya, Iran and North Korea
 Got busted bharat main 11 va 13 may 98 ko buddha-sthal par rajasthan ke pokharan main do teen parmaanu visphot hone se saare vishwa main tahalaka much gaya tha
 Now India is also rich in nuclear powers
 parikshan ke in dhamaako se sara sansar chakeet rah gaya
 There were also cracks in the houses around the testing site
 kintu raashtra ke is mahaan uplabdhi ke saamne logon ko apane gharo ke tutane se itani chintaa nahin hui jitani prasannataa is mahaan safalataa se hui

 All the countrymen were filled with pride along with the Prime Minister
 in parikshanon kaa asar permanu sampann deshon par bahoot adhik hua
 Countries like USA, Russia, France, Japan and China also threatened not to give financial assistance to India
 kintu bharat in dhamkiyon ke saamne nahin jhukaa
 The main purpose of conducting these tests was to tell the world that they were able to give a face-breaking answer to the strategic competence of the neighboring countries
 apni suraksha ore bachaav karne ke lie ve aatmanirbhar the
 Developed countries opposing these tests in India had forgotten that India had one nuclear test in 1974 and five in 1998
 jab ki iske pehle puure vishwa main 2052 parmaanu pareekshan kiye ja chuke the
 Out of these, America has conducted 1032 such tests since 1945
 is ke atirikt soviet sangh rup ne 715, france ne 210, britain ne 457 or china ne 44 parmaanu pareekshan kiye hai
 It is often said about Pakistan and Israel that they also have the capability of nuclear testing and news of nuclear testing can be received from them at any time
 bharat ke kul paanch mukhya parmaanu pareekshan he
 They can be mainly divided into four categories
 ye chaar tarah ke parmaanu pareekshan kiye hai - vikhandaneey bam yaa fishan divaais bam: yah permanu bam banaaye jane ke liye kiya gaya saamaanya pareekshan tha jisaki kshamta san 1974 main kiye gayi pareekshan ke samaan arthath 15 kilo ton thi
 Low-capacity explosion or low-yielding device: Its capacity is considered below 10 kg Un ie unit limited to kg capacity
 is pareekshan kaa ek uddeshy aanse aankde praapt karnaa tha jis se aage jaakar prayogshaala main computer aadhaarit pareekshan kiye ja saken
 Hydrogen Bomb Examination or Thermo Nuclear Device: It is also known as Super Bomb today
 isaki vinaashak kshamta saamaanya parmaanu bam kii tukna main so se hajaar guna taka adhik he
 Measuring the explosive capacity of a nuclear bomb in kilo tons, while measuring the capacity of a hydrogen bomb in megawatts
 sab kilo ton parikshan bharat me 13 may ko punah do parikshan kiye gayi
 These tests were sub-kiloton or less than one kiloton
 is parikshan ke baad yah daawa kiya gaya he ki in se bharat main computer anukaran ev prayogshaalaon main kiye jane vaale apkrantik parikshan kii kshamta praapt karliche he
 Today there are about 60 thousand nuclear weapons in the world, which will take at least 20 to 25 years to destroy
 nirastrikaran ke falswarup keval 10 hajaar parmaanu hathiyaar hi nasht ho sake
 It is clear from this that the threat of nuclear weapons will remain
 isliye bharat ne apni aatmaraksha ke liye yah prayaas kiya he
 Testing of atomic bombs in India When countries like China and America got hydrogen bombs, they started creating an organization to show bigotry to the world and started opposing the nuclear programs started by other countries
 china ne bharat par dadagiri dikhaani shuru kar di jisase bharat ko bhi hydrogen bam banane kaa dabaav padaa
 Subsequently, India started making atomic bombs under the secret mission and on 11 May 1998 successfully tested the hydrogen bomb in the government of Atal Vihari Vajpayee
 bharat sarkaar ne kisi bhi desh ko is pareekshan kii khabar tak nahin lagane di or jaise hi pareekshan kiya gaya, puri duniya main koharaam much gaya
 At that time, India was also criticized in the same way that North Korea is being today
 united nesan ne bharat par sabhi tarah ke aarthik pratibandh laga die jiskaa khamiyaja atal bihari vaajapeyi ko bhugatna padaa or bharat ke aarthik vikaas ko kaaphi nuksaan hua lekin uskaa phayda yah hua ki china ne ham par dadagiri dikhaani band kar di
 Today, India is developing faster than China
 bharat ke alaava pakistan or israel bhi hydrogen bam rakhane kaa daawa karte hai lekin israel ne aaj tak kisi bhi parmaanu bam kaa pareekshan nahin kiya he or pakistan ke pareekshan main wo dhar nahin thi jo ek hydrogen bam main honi chahie

 The langurs can be divided into groups based on these styles of tail movements
 puraani duniya kaa hanuman langur lagbhag puure bharat main paaya jaataa he, or hindu ise bhagwan hanuman kaa avatar maanate hai
 Philip says that in language and literature, it is synonymous with the monkey Langul with a black mouth and long tail
 praani vigyaan main langur narwanar gana main aata he, pehle iskaa naam pressbites antelis tha or isaki 16 kismon kaa varnan he, kintu lagbhag 2000 ke baad iskaa naam semnopithekas, or isaki zyaadaatar kismon ko prajatiyon main badal diya gaya
 That is, Hanuman Langur or Presbytes, whose tail is being talked about here, is now called Semnopithekus
 is lekh ke pehle bhaag main languron main punch vahan kii chaar mukhya shaileyon kaa varnan, duusare bhaag main hanuman or langur kii punch vahan shaileyon kii tulana, or ant main bandar kii kuch anya prajatiyon kii anokhi poonchhon se parichay he
 There are several types of langurs in India, in which Runwal has described four main styles of tailings in Hanuman langur based on his observations, shown in the attached figure
 uttari bharat kii languron kii lagbhag sari kismen apni punch ko peeth ke upar se sir kii ore le jaakar ek challa banaati hai, tathaa punch kaa aglaa bhaag sharir ke daayin yaa baayin ore girtaa he
 This is the northern style
 iske thik vipareet, dakshin ke languron kii lagbhag sari kismen apni punch ko udgam sthal se upar uthaakar sir se peeche kii ore modakar, aglaa hissaa gira dete hai, jisase punch kii angreji ke ‘S’ akshar kii akruti banati he
 This is the southern style
 apane adhyayanon main runvaal ne paaya ki himalay main langur kii kismen poonch ko peeth ke upar sir kii ore le jaati he, par punch kaa aglaa bhaag peeth se upar rahata he, or challa ek taraf se khulaa hota he
 It is the northern Himalayan style
 bharat ke sudur dakshin or srilanka main languron kii kismen punch ko ko udgam sthal se upar uthaakar lagbhag angreji ke ‘S’ akshar kii akruti main le jaati hai, par punch kaa aglaa hissaa neeche na giraakar, khulaa chhod detii hai
 It is a far southern style
 hanuman langur main punch vahan se judi kuch anya mukhya baaten nimna hai
 Brendan Jones explores the four main styles of tailings in the Hanuman Langur discovered by Runwal in the context of the classification of the Langurs
 unhone vah sari jagah jahaan se runvaal ne langur main punch vahan kii jaankaree ikatthi kii, usko ek gajet kaa rup diya
 Chetan Nag and his companions collected information from the 2009–2010 survey of tailings at Hanuman Langur in the southern part of the Indian peninsula and an assessment of the geographical area of the species of langurs
 langur shabd kii utpatti ko philip langul shabd se jodate hai, or kalantar isamen hanuman jud gaye
 The credit goes to Valmiki Rishi, who cast Hanuman in the Ram Katha
 philip kehete hai langur kai anya roopon main bhi manushyon se judaa he
 For example, the relationship of man to a man of the langur is also recognized by the theory of Charles Darwin, in which the origin of humans is told from apes
 itihaaskaar or vidwaan hanuman ko aadim bharat kaa devtaa maanate hai
 The shape of Hanuman is half human, half animal, so according to these scholars the word vrisha-kapi is also used for Hanuman, which is a sign of Guhamanava
 devi or langurveer ke sambandh kii vivechna karte hue, philip hanuman ko, aam aadmi kii manyataon se jodate hai, jaise bhadaavar main languria ke geet, or punjab ke amritsar main langur nrity
 As soon as the festival of Dussehra in Amritsar, people start coming to Hanuman temple from abroad
 bhaktagan langur kaa rup dhaaran kar, moonh par hanuman kaa mukhauta, haath main gada, lambi punch, nange paanv, uchhal-kud karte, apane nivas sthaan se mandir pahunchakar nrity karte hai
 This program runs for ten days
 langur nrity santan prapti ke liye mannath maangane, or phir santan prapti ke baad, kushi zaahir karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Hanuman as the hero of Ramayana and the hero of Vanarasena became popular as Mahavira in the Jan Manas
 kala or sahitya ne hanuman kaa chithran vividh roopon main hua
 Even English literature was not untouched by this
 rudyard kipoling ne anya jantuon ke saath bandaron or languron kaa apni pustakon main varnan kiya
 The complete book of Freida Hauswirth Das is on the social behavior of the langurs and their relation to humans in the world of Orissa
 octavio paaz ne bhi apni pustak main hanuman ke myth kaa chithran kiya
 Runwal, who studied tail movements in langurs in detail, which was introduced in the first part, identified the aforementioned human-monkey relationships under theology
 is disha main unhone hanuman or langur main punch vahan ke adhyayan se pahal kii
 Runwal studied the pictures of Hanuman in which the tail is clearly visible
 chitrakaaron ne hanuman kii punch ko peeth ke samanaantar angreji ke ‘S’ akshar kii akruti main ukera he
 Runewal writes that perhaps painters are ignorant of the style of tailing in actual langurs
 agar vah jaanate hote to uttar bharat main hanuman kii punch vahan style ko uttari rup main banaate, arthath angreji ke ‘S’ akshar kii akruti main nahin
 Runewal writes that Lenius himself considered the length of the tail an important feature of classification, and named the monkeys of the New World and the Old World in a subgroup named sarcopithesai or tail apes
 kintu kuch bandaron kii prajatiyaan asi bhi hai jinamein punch naam-maatr he, jaise laghu-puchh or japani bandar
 The tail is much longer in most monkeys of the new world, in some it is used to hold the fifth hand, such as the red howler monkey
 laal moonh vaale bandar, jo puraani duniya main rahesus bandar ke naam se jane jate hai, punch choti bhale hi hoti he, kintu vyask nar main yah prabhavi netaa kii pahchaan he
 In this species, Runwal studied tail in many practical situations
 or ek muhaavara dum dabaakar bhaagna, yahan thik baithta he, ek bandar apane se prabhaavshaalee bandar ko aate dekh, dum nichi kar duusari ore chalaa jaataa he
 Lion-tailed monkey, the beautiful monkey of South India, is famous for its tail
 isaki kaali deh or chehre ke chaaron ore bhure-safed baalo kaa prabhamandal ise sher kaa rup banane main sahaayak he
 If this langur is unable to reach it by jumping from one wake to another, then with his tail, he comes back from the path without putting his feet on the ground
 This is because its tail is a kind of attraction

 Lb) in the game of cricket is a method of dismissing a batsman
 ek ampire paristhitiyon kii ek shrinkhalaa ke antargat ek ballebaaj ko elbeadblyoo out qaraar detaa he, jab mukhyatah ballebaaj ke wicket se takaraa sakane vaali gend ballebaaj ke sharir se takaraati he
 The LBW rule was created so that the batsman does not use the body in place of his bat to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket
 elbeadblyoo ko saamanytah is khel ke sabase jatil niyam ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Despite the use of leg in the term leg before wicket, this rule applies even if the ball hits the batsman's other part of the body except for the bat's hand gloves
 elbeadblyoo kaa niyam 1744 tak cricket ke niyamon main shaamil nahin tha
 This rule was first used in 1774, according to which: If the batsman is considered out


 or else the batsman will stick his leg in front of the wicket to stop the ball and stop the ball from hitting the wicket
 jabaki elbeadblyoo niyam ke prayog kii shuruyaat nishchit rup se ballebaaj dwaara gend ko wicket se na takaraane dene ke liye jaanboojh kar taang va pair adaane ke kaaran hui thi, jon nairen jaise shuruaati lekhakon ne jaanboojh kar kiye jane vaale is kaam ke liye tom tailor tathaa joe ring ko jimmedaar mana he
 However, his career began after 1774 and, as Arthur Hegarth points out, "it is now impossible to reconcile these conflicting statements"
 isi vajah se elbeadblyoo ke niyam ko kai varshon tak record nahin kiya gaya tha
 John Toughton was dismissed by John Wells under LBW rule in the match of Surrey v England XI at Moulsey Hurst in August 1795
 hegarth ke anusaar: is match main, pehali baar aisa paaya gaya ki "pagabaadha" ko darj kiya gaya he 
brishar kii mudrit score-pustika main, is match main mi
 je
 tafton ko keval bold qaraar diya gaya he, tathaa note main pagabaadha likhaa gaya he
 In the beginning, when any batsman was out in this manner, it was only written that he was bowled and not pugged
 sankshep main is niyam kaa saar yah he: If the ball hits the batsman who was about to hit the wicket, it is called LBW, unless: dhyaan den: leg said se baahar padane vaali gendon se abhipraay yah he ki gend kaa pachaas pratishat yaa isse adhik hissaa leg stump ke baahar avashya hona chahie
 In addition, the ball hitting the batsman outside the off-stump must have a fifty percent or more hit against the batsman outside the off-stump line
 apni jatiltaaon ke baavjood, kaich evam bold ke pashchaat pagabaadha ) cricket main out karne kaa sabase saamaanya prakaar he
 Following are the conditions for declaring a batsman LBW: in sthitiyon kii vyakhya karne ke teen niyam hai: ke apwaad main ampaire kaa yah nirnay shaamil hota he ki ballebaaj ne gend ko maarane kaa prayaas kiya he athwa nahin
 This rule has been made so that the batsman does not just play the ball outside the off-stump on the pad, which eliminates the possibility of hitting the ball with the bat
 spin gendbaajon ke khilaaf ek aam rakshaatmak ranneeti of stump par gend se bachane ke liye pad kaa istemaal karnaa he, kintu elbeadblyoo niyam kaa matlab he ki unka balla pad ke najadik ho, jisase slip main khadey kshetrarakshakon ko kaich pakadaney kaa mauka mili, yaa unke elbeadblyoo out hone kii sambhaavna bane
 Some reviewers, such as Richie Bainod, have suggested that the LBW rule should be changed in such a way that the batsman can be called out even if he is slightly out of the leg stump, which will help the legspiners and avoid negative pad-play
 elbeadblyoo niyam kii samiksha hameshaa gendbaaj ke chor par khadey ampire dwaara kii jaati he
 If the fielding team believes that a batsman can be out lbw, they should request the umpire for a decision
 gend, jisase ballebaaj tak pahunchane main aadhe second kaa samay lagata he, ke liye sabhi elbeadblyoo sthitiyon kaa moolyankan kiya janaa chahie
 As in other aspects of the rules, the batsman is always given the benefit of any doubt, therefore, if the umpire is not satisfied, the request will be turned down
 For example if the batsman steps one before the ball hits the batsman
 Goes ahead
 ho saktaa he gend aage chal kar wicket se takaraa jaati, kintu ek ampaire ke liye is bare main sunishchit hona bahut mushkil he kyonki ballebaaj kii taang se takaraate samay gend wicket se 1
5-2 meter kii duuri par hogi
 Through television replays it is now easy to tell whether all the conditions of LBW were met and therefore some people complain that an umpire wrongly asked the batsman to continue the game or that he was wrongly Dubbed out
 haalanki ampire dwaara kisi ballebaaj ko out dene se pehle is bare main sunishchit hona chahie ki vah out he ki nahin or chunki unke paas tivi riple jaisi koi suvidha nahin hoti, atah ampire kaa nirnay aamtaur par uchit hota he
 Most players and commentators accept this decision and there is little criticism from umpires
 yakeenan elbeadblyoo kaa nirnay ampiron dwaara kiye jane vaale nirnyon main se sabase kathin he or yah darshakon ke bich tippanee or vivaad kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 In recent years, due to the increasing pressure in cricket and the money at stake, many have been emphasizing the role of cameras in uncertain cases and the use of simulation techniques such as the hawk-eye
 philhal, elbeadblyoo ek aisa nirnay he jo keval maidan par khadey ampaire dwaara liya jaataa he
 However, the wind has changed: In September 2005, the International Cricket Council authorized a test by umpires to aid decision-making through television replays
 
 It is worth noting that if the ball hits the pad first and then hits the bat, the batsman can be declared out lbw but if the batsman hits the ball with the bat and after that the ball hits his pad, The batsman cannot be declared out in that case
 haalanki, donon hi maamalon main, ek ballebaaj dwaara kaich out hone kaa khatra bana rahata he kyonki gend apekshaakrit dhimi gati se uchhal kar najdiki kshetrarakshak dwaara lapki ja sakati he
 If the ball hits the batsman without breaking, then in that case the umpire has to guess the direction of the ball by its speed and bounce, ignoring any possible deviations after the ball has been hit
 haalanki gend wicket se takaraayegi yaa nahin, yah nirdhaarit karne se pehle ampaire gend ke swing yaa pravaah ko dhyaan main rakh saktaa he

 ek galatafahami he ki ballebaaj us sthiti main elbeadblyoo out nahin ho saktaa jab gend leg stump ke baahar tappa khaati he

 "it is worth noting here that, in Rule 36
1, there is no mention of the leg side, nor does it state that such a condition occurs more than once
 Thus a ball that bounces twice may result in lbw
 Even if it is out of the line of a tapped leg stump
 No batsman has been dismissed in this manner in international cricket
 elbeadblyoo ek shabd he jiskaa prayog 21 navambar 1934 ko mericabone cricket club dwaara banaaye gaye pagabaadha niyam main badlaav kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya gaya tha
 It came into existence in England in 1935, but was opposed by higher level officials in Australia where it could not be in force until the 1936 / 1937 season, although in club matches during the 1935 / 1936 season in Australia it was An attempt was made to implement
 is badlaav ke anusaar of stump se baahar tappa padane par bhi elbeadblyoo out ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he yadi wicket se wicket ke bich kii sidhi rekha main ballebaaj ise apane sharir ke kisi hisse se roktaa he
 Earlier, LBW could be dismissed only by the balls falling in the straight line between the bowler's end and the batsman's wickets
 shabd "elbeadblyoo " is tathy ko sanderbhit karata he ki 1935 se 1937 tak vijden dwaara prakashit scorcardon main nae pagabaadha niyam dwaara liye gaye wicket 1935 ke pehle ke niyamon ke viketon se alag darshaae gaye the
 During the 1920s and 1930s the characteristic of first-class cricket was the increasing dominance of the bowlers by the batsmen

 It was clear to the officials that the batsmen who played good pad play like Herbert Sutcliffe and Phil Mead were responsible for the high runs and the increasing number of draw matches
 atah of stump se baahar padane vaali gendon ko pad dwaara rokane se bachaane kaa uddeshy na keval pad play kaa muqabla karnaa tha balki of stump par gend daalane vaale gendbaajon ko puraskrit karke tej "bodiline " gendbaaji ko hatotsahit karnaa bhi tha or isi kaaran of said main aakarshak stroke khilne ko protsaahan mila
 It was heavily scrutinized in 1934 and it was generally agreed that an extension of the LBW rule on the off side could reduce defensive pad play

 jabaki abhaasi shakti keval ek ganitiya raashi he jo lod ke siron ke bich ke voltage or lod se hokar pravaahit dhara maan) ke gunanfal ke baraabar hoti he
 The power coefficient is equal to the cosine of the difference between the voltage and current
 shakti gunak = p / s That is, in order to have good power coefficient it is necessary that the difference between voltage and current is very low
 jab dhara, voltata se peeche hoti he to ise laging power factor kehete hai; jab dhara, voltata se aage hoti he to ise 'leading power-factor' kaha jaataa he
 In industries, the power coefficient is often backward due to induction motors and other inductive loads

 "anusuchit janajati kaa darja hamaara sanvaidhanik or janmasiddh adhikaar he or ham har haal main ise lekar rahenge", isi pran ke saath samaaj ke sabhi virgon ko sakaaratmak va sateek disha main aage aane kaa krantikari aahvaan he, kyonki isi main samaaj or rajya kii bhalaai antarnihit he
 : purvi bharat main sthit chotanagpur kaa pathaar, jiske antargat jharkhand rajya kaa adhiktar hissaa evam urisa, pashchim bengal va chhattisgarh ke kuch bhaag aate hai
 According to the geological study of the rocky crust of Chotanagpur, it has rocks of the ancient Gondwana continent, ie the development of this plateau is very old
 yah dakhkhan pathaar kaa purvottaree khand tha, jo dakhkhan takhte ke saath-saath gondvanaa ke khandit hone par aaj se lagbhag 12 karod saal pehle alag hokar 5 karod varshon tak uttar disha main chalata rahaa or phir uresia se ja takaraayaa
 The Chhotanagpur plateau has been the abode of tribals since the Adi period, where the Kudmi / Kurmi tribes have been living together with tribal communities like Ho, Munda, Santhal, Oraon etc
 magar aaj ke vartmaan paristhiti main totemic kudmi adivasee chautarafa pakshpaat kii nitiyon ke bich pisate apane pahchaan va astitv kii ladaai main jujh rahe hai
 The sad thing is that knowing this agriculturally hard working tribal community has always been neglected
 kudmi adivasee the, hai or rahenge, isamen kahin koi shaq nahin
 But sometimes it is unfortunate to try to prove them to be non-tribals and to try to find small mistakes and to prove them right from the point of view
 kai baar to ye behad niraashajanak hote hai
 Like, Adivasis cultivate only as much as they need, whereas Kudmi produces more than they need to sell in the market, so they are not Adivasis
 ye kaisaa tark he? matlab adivasee vahi, jo sirf apane jarurat ke mutabik hi kaam karte hai, matlab unhen usase adhik kii jarurat hi nahin rahati
 Then there is no need for them to do jobs or to move forward in academic, political, economic or any other way! Save only as much as you need and be happy in that, then they will be called adivasis, is that so? Is this the definition of tribal? Farmers of some Kudmi areas have been producing more paddy and vegetables for some time, but for this, the farmers there have to work hard in the scorching sun, getting wet in the rain, in the scorching cold, with all the weather, Because except they have no choice
 meraa mamaa ghar usee kshetra main hone ke kaaran maine dekha he or bachapan se dekhtaa aa rahaa hum, ki kaise jab naukrishuda log subah ke saat-aath baje tak chaiyn kii neend sote rahete hai, tab wo bhor ke 4 baje se uthakar apane kheton main jaakar kadi mehnat karte hai
 There is a cycle of hard work from production to execution
 samyantaral, badalte parivesh, manhagaai or khaane ke alaave apni anya jaruraton ko puri karne ke saath bacchon ke bhavishya kii chintaa ke liye majaboorivash unhen aisa karnaa padataa he
 In spite of reading and writing according to the population, it is also a big reason for being deprived of jobs and unemployed
 hamaare kshetra main sambhaavna or paristhiti waisi nahin he, isaliye log utani kheti nahin karte or unhen majabuuran factriyon main jaakar mazdooron kaa kaam karnaa padataa he, jahaan kii sthiti gulaami va shoshan ke bich or bhi bhayaavah he
 Sadly, no one can understand their agony, all are driven by unilateral ideology
 "adivasee matlab aadim adhivaasee yani adikaal se nivasarat mulnivaasee, is paribhaasha ko samajhane kii jarurat he
 " kuch log kudamiyon ko muulavaasi kehete hai to kuch sadaan kahkar sambodhit karte hai
 But when, where and how did these two words originate? The term natives did not exist before Jharkhand became a separate state
 jharkhand alag hone ke baad jharkhandiyon ko baanto or raaj karo kii niti va sajeesh ke tahat adivasee or muulavaasi ke rup main baantkar alag kar diya gaya
 According to Sadan, our colleague Dr
 Rakesh Mahato Da, leave this word in Hindi, but it is not found in any language's language
 is shabd kaa pehla upyog yaa khoj bi pi kesari or unke guru ji, jinke netritv main kesari babu ne piechdi kii thi, ne kii
 Kesari ji, by resorting to his Guru ji, wrote a book called "sadan of Jharkhand" and also forced Kudmi to force him into a fictional community called Sadan
 baad main kesari ji ke is koshish ko bir birottam, ranchi express ke sampadak balvir dutt aadi ne sadaan shabd ko sthapit karne main kaaphi madad kii
 Because of this, he got a great opportunity to join the largest tribal community of Jharkhand like Kudmi from tribal and join them
 isse unhen do phayda ho rahaa tha, ek jharkhand main adivasee kii sankhya kam dikhaaya ja saktaa tha or doosraa kudmi ko bahari yaa gaiyr adivasee dikhaane kii chirakanksha kii purti ho rahi thi, saath hi saath nav kalpit tathakthith sadaan samooh ko bada taqatvar or prabhaavshaalee banaaya ja saktaa tha
 Now another new story is being associated with the horse, while the oldest introduction to the horse is to the Jharkhandi tribal community
 kyonki aaryon ke paas ghode the or ghode kii teji ke kaaran hi hadappa mohenjodaro main adivaasiyon ko aaryon se haarana pad tha
 Even today, the tribals at Khelachand Chandi Aradhana offer a mud horse and pray to their worshipers, that the horse on which we suffered defeat at the hands of the Aryans, give us protection from that horse
 phir jharkhandi samaaj ko ghode se aparichit bataanaa ek nayi kahani or nayi sajeesh kii shuruuaat lagati he
 As far as the kudmi farmers are concerned, the farmers have cows, bulls, buffaloes and not horses
 mul baat yah he, ki kudamiyon main likhane waalon kii kami rahane ke kaaran inke bare main jab jise jo man main aayaa bina uchit shodh ke suni sunaayi baton ke aadhaar par likh diya
 Apart from this, where there should be a discussion or mention of the status of the kudumis and the kudami legends and martyrs, it was ignored
 sabase durbhagyapurna baat jo kudamiyon ke saath ghatit hui, wo thi chotanagpur ke kudamiyon ko uttar bharat ke kurmiyon ke saath joda janaa
 All this confusion began with the confusion spread by the 'all India Kurmi Kshatriya Mahasabha' formed in Uttar Pradesh in 1894
 1915 main is sanghathan ne bharat ke sabhi kurmiyon ke liye kshatriya states kii maang kii
 Since the Kurmis of Chotanagpur also used to write Kurmi in English, due to having the same name, they, along with the British, demanded Kshatriya status for them in 1922 and in 1929 and 31, the State Government and Central Government gave memorandum in this regard
 ye maang bahari kurmiyon kii thi, naa ki chotanagpur ke totemic kudmi janajatiyon kii, ye dhyaan dene vaali baat he
 But instead of understanding this deep conspiracy with the Kudmi tribals, all those motivated by prejudice continue to sidestep it
 ech ech rizle ke 'tribs and casts of bengal' main saaf ullekh kiya gaya he, ki chotanagpur ke kudmi bihar ke kurmiyon se alag dravid prajati ke adivasee samudaay ke log hai
 Sir Grierson further clarified this in the 'linguistic Survey of India', that due to the print / prominence mistake, Kudmi of Chotanagpur and Kurmi of Bihar, both of whom were spelled 'KURMI' in English, but here the tribes of Chotanagpur Hard 'R' and Soft 'R' have been used for Kurmis of Bihar
 kumaar suresh singh ne to apane 'pipul of india' ke bihar wolum main 'KUDMI' or 'KURMI' donon ko sepperate chapter dekar puri tarah alag kar diya he
 This proves that the Kurmis of Chhotanagpur are completely different from the Kurmis of the rest of India
 inke bhashaa, samskruti, parampara, reeti rivaajon evam anya kisi bhi prakaar se koi mail nahin he
 The biggest difference is in their being Gustidhari and Gotradhari
 isaliye chotanagpur ke kudamiyon kaa shivaji maharaj or sardaar patel se bhi ek bhartiya ke alaave kisi bhi tarah kaa koi sambandh nahin he, jo baat har kisi ko acchhee tarah se samaj lenaa chaiye
 Later, the word Kurmi for Chudamis of Chotanagpur was improved to Kurmi Mahto and Kurmi / Kudmi by the Government of Jharkhand, although the proposal was of Kudmi / Kurmi, also messed up here
 kudmi adivasee samudaay ko 1950 main bina kisi notiphecshan ke anusuchit janajati kii suchi main shaamil karne se chhod diya gaya, jabaki wo purv kii janaganana main aadim janajati kii suchi main shaamil the, magar 1950 main kyon chhod diya gaya, iske kaaran agyaat hai
 Why was such injustice done to the Kudmi tribe? This was part of a much larger conspiracy, aimed at reducing the population and percentage of tribals and a well-thought-out trick of transferring the lands of the Kudumis
 udhaahranswaroop is shantipriy krushijivi samudaay ko annaipurvak vikaas ke naam par apane jameenon se naanaa prakaar se bedakhal kiya gaya evam yah parampara aaj bhi badastoor jari he
 This eviction has been done in the name of kal-factory, reservoir, underground mining, education-training institute, thermal power institution and metropolitan construction etc
 iskaa jwalanth udhaaharan hai - jamshedpur, bokaro, dhanbad, ranchi, hazaribagh, purulia, rirangpur, rourkela aadi nagaren evam chandil, hirakund, mathan, tilaiya, consavati aadi jalashay tathaa tata, bsail aadi jaise plant, jahaan sabase adhik prabhavit hue hai kudmi samaaj ke log or badale main mila he sirf or sirf visthaapan
 How will the loss of this community in every area in these 67 years be compensated? Since then, the continuous non-violent Kudmi tribal community has been given aja
 Efforts are on to include it in the list
 jane kitne memorondom diye gayi kitne andolan kiye gayi, magar dhokhaa, chal va thagi ke alaave ab tak kuch nahin mila
 People associate it with reservation, but it is not only for reservation, but also to preserve our real identity and preserve our existence
 ye kisi ke haq chhinane ke liye bhi nahin, ye to hamaara sanvaidhanik adhikaar he evam isse kisi kaa haq kisi rup main nahin chhinega, balki adivaasiyon kii shakti or samarthy badhegi va 'chhathvin anusuchee' ke maapdand puure honge
 Many times misunderstandings are spread to create a rift between them for the purpose of not allowing the Kudmi tribals and other tribes to unite
 jaise, anya adivaasiyon se kaha jaataa he, ki ye aapkaa haq chhinana chaahate hai or kudmi adivaasiyon se kehete hai, ye aapako aapkaa haq dena nahin chaahate
 There is a great need to understand the purpose of this conspiracy
 samay samay par kai adivasee buddhijiviyon evam netaaon ne bhi kudamiyon ko anusuchit janajati main shaamil naa karne ko anuchit qaraar diya he or kudmi samudaay ko anusuchit janajati suchi main shaamil karne kii vakaalat kii he, jisamen dow ramadayal munda se lekar dow nirmal minj, shibu sorain, surya singh besara aadi pramukh hai
 The JMM party's menufesto always involved this issue
 jharkhand ke vartmaan siem raghuvar das bhi 2009 lok sabha chunaav ke dauraan ye baat kah chuke hai
 The Arjun Munda government has twice recommended to the Center
 jamshedpur ke divangat saansad shahid sunil mahato, jamshedpur kii purv saansad abha mahato or urisa ke saansad rabindra kumaar jena sansad main aawaaj uthaa chuke hai
 Apart from this, many mlas and mps have periodically spoken in support of it in the Legislative Assembly and Parliament
 magar phir bhi 67 saal biit jane ke baad bhi kudmi samudaay ko ab tak asti suchi main shaamil naa kar isapar sirf raajnneeti karnaa bada hi durbhagyapurna he or sampoorn kudmi samudaay ko uske vaazib haq se maharoom rakhkar unke vishwaas par kutharaghaat he
 Prior to the last Lok Sabha election, Honorable BJP MP Shri Laxman Gilua ji had given a written letter to the Secretary of Kudmi Vikas Morcha, assuring that after becoming MP, the demand for inclusion of the Kudmi community in the list of Scheduled Tribes was appropriate in Parliament Will keep it properly, but even after two years, the Honorable MP has not taken any initiative in this direction, which raises many questions and contradictions in itself
 It opens the polity of their vote politics and clearly exposes the difference between their words and actions
 magar ye anyaay sirf kudmi adivaasiyon ke prati nahin, balki gaur se sochaa or samajha jaay to sampoorn adivasee samudaay ke saath he
 It should be noted that vide notification number 3563-J dated 08 December 1931 issued by the Government of Bihar and Orissa, the notification no
 The tribes registered in 550 have been declared as tribes and exempted from the provisions of the Indian Succession Act 1865 and 1925
 arthath ye sabhi bharat main lagu hindu lau yaa muslim lau ke bajaay adivaasiyon ke apane parmparik saamaajik shashan vyavastha "customri lau" se sanchalit / shasit hote hai, jiske antargat karypalika, nyaaypalika va vyavsthapika teenon shashan tantra antarnihit hai
 Even the "non-government tribals of the Kudmi / Kurmi community of Jharkhand" in the "report of the Committee on Jharkhand Affairs May 1990", presented on 30 March 1992 by the then Minister of State for Home, MM Jacob, in both houses of Parliament
 Has been designated / marked as "
 yahaan ullekh karnaa aavashyak he, ki adivasee to adivasee hi hote hai, sarkari or gaiyr sarkari kaa kya taatpary? sambhavat: kudmi adivasee ko, jo sarkari suchi main shaamil naa hone ke kaaran ukt report main gaiyr sarkari adivasee kaha gaya he
 Kudmi tribes have the same civilization, culture, tradition, customs, lifestyle, food, dress, festivals, festivals, rituals, wedding-marriages, nruta-kaman etc
 as other tribes have 
 chotanagpur ke kudmi / kurmi samudaay or anya janajatiyon main vyaapt samanta nimanlikhit he : 1
) The biggest similarity between the Kudmi community and other tribal communities is their totemic
 prayek janajati yaa adivasee samudaayon kii pahchaan unke totem se hi hota he, jo unke aadi-purakhon ne samaaj ko vargeekrut karne ke liye ped-paudhun, pashu-pakshiyon yaa anya prakritik aadhaarit naamon par rakhaa tha
 For example, as in Santal there are totems like Soren, Murmu, Tudu etc
, in the Kudmi tribe, Naguar, Kaduar, hindir, Bansriar, Kachuar, Kesriar, Banuar, Punarriar, Dungir, Ktir, Dumriar etc
 81 original totems are found
 And some have about 120 totems, including sub-totems
 prayek totem kaa ek totem chinh evam nishedh hota he, jaise - kachuaar totem waalon kaa totem chinh kachua hota he evam ye kachua ko maarthe yaa khate nahin, kahin milane par tel sindur lagaakar waapas pani main chhod dete hai
 In the same way Naguar's snake snake, Kaduar kara etc
 anya janajatiyon kii tarah inamen samaan totem main rishta varjit he
 2
) Like other Manjhi Mahal system of tribal communities, the Kudmi community also has its own social governance system, which is called Mahato Parganait system
 gaanv ke mukhiya ko mahato or pargana ke mukhiya ko parganait kehete hai
 All the problems of any kind of society are executed and handled by the officials of Parganat
 3
) kudmi janajatiyon kii puja paddati bhi anya janajatiyon ke samaan hi he
 These nature worshipers do all their worship by themselves and mass worship is performed by Laya / Pahan / Deuri
 ye devtaa ke rup main niraakaar garaam, dharam, basamaata, baipahaad aadi kii aradhana karte hai or adipurush va adimata ke rup main budahababa or mahama ko apana aradhy maanate hai
 In Santal, Burubonga i
e
 Marangburu, which is known as Kudmi Badupahar, similarly Hatubonga called Garam Thakur, Singbonga i
e
 Dharmesh which is called Surjahi i
e
 Dharam and Sarna Thanh is Jaher Than
 jaherthan main garaam thakur va jaahiramaye ke aradhana main gaanv ke purvajon ko yaad kiya jaataa he va basamaata ke rup main dharti mata kii aradhana kii jaati he
 4
) Each tribal community has its own Kabilawachi language, such as Santali of Santal, Mundari of Munda, Ho Ki Ho, Kuduk of Oraon etc
 usee tarah kudmi samudaay kii bhi apni swytt kabilavachi bhashaa he - kudmali
 5
) The culture of Kudmi tribes is also similar to other tribes, which is completely and purely based on agriculture and nature, which is known as "baraa Masek Tera Parab"
 inamen akhin main hir punaha se lekar sijhaad / pathipuja, sarhul / phulpujas, rahain, maasant parab, chitau parab, gamaha parab, karam, jitia, jilhud, bandana / sohraay or tusu thapana va tusu bhaasaan tak sabhi vishisht aadi samskruti ke parichaayak hai
 All the parabas have a special reason and importance and there is no change or alteration in their date, because it is not based on the date but according to the calculation of the days of the month, such as 'karam' in Bhadar Ekadashi of Shukla Paksha and This is also a sign of their primitiveness
 6
 kudmi adivaasiyon ke reeti-rivaajon main bhi shaadi-byaah jaise maukey par vishisht aadi parampara kaa anupaalan kiya jaataa he, jo kaniya dekha se shuru hokar bar dekha, duir khunda, lagan dharaa, madua baandha, sajani saja, nakh tunga, aam biha, mauha biha, aamakh khia, gad dhaua, saalaa dati, dubhi khia, thubada biha, sinndaradaan, chumaan, bidaai, kenya bhitara, pitar pindha se lekar samadhin dekha tak ke neg main drushtigochar hota he
 The Kudmi tribal community, which has a population of more than two crore in the entire Chotanagpur plateau, has not had a single higher administrative official for more than 50 years and has not held the high positions in other areas and economic, social, educational , Being extremely backward in every level of political shows their 'backwardness'
 iske alaave desh va pradesh ke prati kudmi samudaay ke balidanon or yogadan ko bhuule se bhulaayaa nahin ja saktaa
 But the legendary Amar Shaheed Krantivir Raghunath Mahato of 'chuhad Rebellion', the first movement against the Zamindari / Malgujari system and British rule, was forgotten and no place was given in history, which is extremely regrettable
 iske alaave buli mahato va kanka mohanta jaise kai kudmi vir shahid swatantraaa andolan itihaas ke pannon main gaayab hai
 The contribution and martyrdom of many leaders like the leaders of the Jharkhand movement, Binod Bihari Mahato, Krantidoot Shaktinath Mahato, Messiah Nirmal Mahato and the martyrdom needs to be given due respect
 is tarah se dekha jaay to swabhimani magar bholi-bhali kudmi adivasee samudaay shuru se shadyantra kaa shikaar rahi he va vartmaan halaat main har kshetra main pichhadakar ek dayaneey sthiti main pahunch chuki he
 The sting of governmental neglect is constantly pushing them into the trough
 inke utthan va bahuaiami samasyaon yatha - bhashaai, saanskrithik, saamaajik, paaramparik, aarthik, rajnatik, shaikshanik, rojgaar evam krishi sambandhi ke samaadhaan ke liye evam haq-adhikaar kii raksha ke liye aavashyaktaa he, to sirf raajnneetik soch, purvaagrah va ekatarfa vichaardhaara kii manobhaawanaaon ko tyagkar inke liye nyyochit kadam uthaane kii, jisaki main sabhi mahanubhaavon evam buddhijiviyon se namr nivedan karata hum
