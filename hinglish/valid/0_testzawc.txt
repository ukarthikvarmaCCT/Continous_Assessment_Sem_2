 The decision to partition Bengal was announced on 19 July 1905 by Lord Curzon, the then Viceroy of India

 The partition took effect from 16 October 1905
 itihaas main ise bangbhang ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 It was a part of the British "divide - rule" policy
 at: iske virodh main 1908 i
 main sampoorn desh main `bang-bhang' aandolan shuru ho gaya
 The eastern and western parts of Bengal were reunited in 1911 due to pressure from the Indian people on both sides due to high level political unrest caused by this division
 bengal praant kaa kshetrafal 489,500 varg kilometre or jansankhya 8 karod se zyada thi
 East Bengal was geographically and almost isolated from West Bengal due to less communication means
 1836 main, upree praanton ko ek leftinent governor ke shashan ke antargat kar diya gaya or 1854 main governor general-in-council ko bengal ke pratyaksh prashasan se mukt kar diya gaya
 Assam was separated from Bengal, including Sylhet, in 1874 to form a separate chief-commissioner, and later in 1898 Lushai Hills was also included
 bengal jaise bade or itani adhik aabaadi vaale praant kaa prabandhan bahut kathin tha
 The partition of Bengal was first thought in 1903
 chittagong tathaa dhaka or maimansingh ke jilon ko bengal se alag kar assam praant main milaane ke atirikt prastaav bhi rakhe gaye the
 Similarly, Chota Nagpur was also to be merged with the Central Province
 san 1903 main hi congress kaa bhi 19vaan adhiveshan madras main hua tha
 On the same occasion, its Chairman Mr
 Lalmohan Ghosh, in his address criticized the reactionary policy of the government, reported imminent mutilation on an all-india platform
 unhone kaha ki is prakaar kaa ek shadyantr chal rahaa he
 The government officially published the idea in January of 1904 and in February Lord Curzon made official visits to assess the public opinion on the partition in the eastern districts of Bengal
 unhone pramukh hastiyon ke saath paraamarsh kiya or dhaka, chatgaanv tathaa maimansingh main bhaashan dekar vibhaajan par sarkaar ke rukh ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya
 Henry John Stedman Cotton, who was Chief Commissioner of Assam from 1896 to 1902, opposed the idea
 congress ke agle adhiveshan main sabhapati pad se bolte hue sar henry coton ne bhi yah kaha ki yadi yah bahaanaa he ki itane bade praant ko ek rajyapal sanbhaal nahin saktaa to yaa to bombai or madras kii tarah bengal kaa shashansutra saprishad rajyapal ke sipurd ho yaa banglaa bhashiyon ko alag karke ek praant banaaya jaae
 In those days Bengal province also included Bihar and Orissa
 par british sarkaar ne na to congress kii parvaah kii, na janamat kii
 The then Viceroy and Governor General Lord Curzon tried to convince the people in the Land Holders Association or Zamindar Sabha that vangabhang would only benefit
 vah swayan purv bengal main bhi gaye, par mutthi bhar musalamaanon ke atirikt kisi ne is prastaav kaa samarthan nahin kiya
 The then Nawab of Dhaka, reputed among the Muslims, also opposed it in the first charge
 1905 main 16 oktober ko bharat ke tatkaaleen waisarai lard karjan dwaara bengal kaa vibhaajan kiya gaya
 The division was encouraged for administrative tasks, Bengal being almost as large as France, with a population much larger than France
 aisa sochaa gaya ki purvi kshetra upekshit or uchit rup se shasit nahin tha
 With the division of the province, better administration could be established in the eastern region, so that the people there would ultimately benefit from school and employment opportunities
 haalaanki, vibhaajan kii yojana ke peeche anya uddeshy bhi chhipe the
 Bengali Hindus were pioneers in the political movement for greater participation in governance, so now their position was weakened due to the increase in the dominance of the Muslims in the past
 Both Hindus and Muslims opposed the partition
 After partition, however, an almost anti-british movement prevailed at the national level, including non-violent and violent protests, boycotts and even the assassination of the governor of the new province of West Bengal

 The Nawab of Dhaka had earlier protested, but he became in his favor when he became disenchanted
 sar jojeff bamfield fuller purvavang or assam ke nae leftinant governor bane
 He is said to have said openly in many places that Hindus and Muslims are his two bibis, of which Muslims are his favorites
 is kathan kaa aashay spasht tha
 Vangabhang was not intended to facilitate administration, as it was claimed, but rather had two clear objectives, one to fight a Hindu Muslim and the other to hurt the newly awakened Bengal
 yadi gaharaai se dekha jaae to yaheen se pakistan kaa bijaropan hua
 One of the resolutions passed in the 1906 session of the Muslim League was also that vangabhang is good for Muslims and those who agitate against it do wrong things and they harm Muslims
 baad ko chalakar lig ke 1908 ke adhiveshan main bhi yah prastaav paarit hua ki congress ne vangbhang ke virodh kaa jo prastaav rakhaa he, vah sweekruti ke yogya nahin
 The new province included the hill states of Tripura, Chittagang Mandal, Dhaka and Rajshahi and the Malda district was merged into Assam province

 The new province was named East Bengal and Assam respectively, with Dhaka, the capital of East Bengal, and Chittagong, the subordinate headquarters of Assam
 iskaa kshetrafal 106,540 varg mile tha or jansankhya teen karod das lakh thi, jisame ek karod assi lakh muslim or ek karod bees lakh hindu the
 There was a Legislative Council and a two-member Revenue Board for administration and the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court was not changed
 sarkaar ne ingit kiya ki purvi bengal or assam ke bich ek sahi dhang se nirdhaarit pashchimi seemaa hogi or suparibhaashit bhugolic, nrikul vigyaani, bhashiya evam saamaajik visheshtaayen hongi
 The Government of India publicized its final decision with the accepted resolution of 19 July 1905 and the partition of Bengal came into force from 16 October of the same year
 1911 main radd kiye jane se purv, vibhaajan bamushkil aadhe dashak tak chal paaya tha
 However, the UK policy behind Partition was Divide et Impera, which continued to influence the reorganized province

 Prior to this, many members of both communities advocated national unity for all Bengalis

 Muslims now wanted to make the entire province a part of the Muslim state, Pakistan
 1947 main bengal duusari baar, is baar dharmik aadhaar par, vibhajit hua
 It became East Pakistan
 haalaanki, 1971 main pashchimi pakistani sainya shashan ke saath ek safal mukti yuddh ke baad purvi pakistan bangladesh naam kaa swatantra rajya ban gaya
 There was bloodshed in both the divisions of Bengal
 isane ek bada raajnneetik sankat paidaa kiya
 Muslims in East Bengal believed that a separate region would provide them more opportunities for education, employment, etc
, whereas the people of West Bengal did not like this partition and a large amount of nationalist literature was produced during this time
 bhartiya rashtriya congress dwaara kiye gaye virodh kaa netritv sar henry jon stedman coton ne kiya jo purv main assam ke mukhya ayukta the, parantu karzan adig rahe
 Later, Cotton, now a liberal MP from East Nottingham, successfully campaigned for the removal of Sir Bemfield Fuller, the first lieutenant-governor of East Bengal

 Due to these political protests, both parts of Bengal were reunited in 1911

 This language-related study has been named in Europe with many names and nouns till date
 sarvapratham is adhyayan ko philology shabd ke aage visheshan ke rup main ek shabd joda gaya- tab ise ‘‘comparative philology’’ kah kar pukaara gaya
 Until the nineteenth century, grammar and linguistic studies were often considered to be the same
 atah ise vidwaanon ne 'comparative grammer' naam bhi diya
 In France it was named Langistić
 france main bhashaa sambandhi kaary adhik hone ke kaaran unnisvin sadi main sampoorn europe main hi "linguistique" athwa "linguistics" naam hi prachlit rahaa he
 Apart from this, other names like 'science of Language', 'glutology' etc
 also came in handy to reveal this subject
 aaj in sabhi naamon main se ‘‘linguisticks’’, ‘‘philology’’ maatr hi prayog main laae jate hai
 In addition to all these European names in India, the names which are used in Hindi language are as follows - "bhasha-shastra", "bhasha-tattva", "bhasha-sasti", and "" Comparative linguistics "etc
 in sabhi naamon main se sarv prachlit naam ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’ he
 All the names, ancient and new, appear to be synonymous in these names
 atah yahi naam is shaastra ke liye sarvatha upyukt prathit hota he
 In its present form, linguistics is said to be the brain of Western scholars

 prakaaraantar se yah ek bhashaa-adhyayan sambandhi granth hi he
 In Sanskrit literature, even in philosophical and literary texts, we get indications of language scientific discussions only under the subtle interpretation of the words' meaning ',' rasa ',' bhava ',' language available here and there in Sanskrit literature
 -conceptual material can certainly be called the cornerstone of current linguistics
 aadhunik vishay ke rup main bhashaa-vigyaan kaa sutarapaat europe main san 1786 i0 main sar wiliam jones naamak vidwaan dwaara kiya gaya mana jaataa he
 In the context of the study of Sanskrit language, Sir William Jones had first done a comparative study of Sanskrit, Greek and Latin language and expressed the possibility that at least one of the languages forms the basis of these three languages
 atah in teenon bhashaaon ke bich ek sookshm sambandh sutara avashya vidyaman he
 This type of comparative study of languages became the first step in the field of modern linguistics
 ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’ naam main do padon kaa prayog hua he
 "language" and "science"
 bhashaa-vigyaan ko samajhane se purv in donon shabdon se parichit hona aavashyak prathit hota he
 The word 'bhasha' is derived from the Sanskrit "bhash" metal
 jiskaa arth he-vyakt vaak 
 The word 'science' is formed by applying the prefix 'v' and 'lute' from the 'known' metal
 saamaanya rup se ‘bhashaa’ kaa arth he ‘bol chaal kii bhashaa yaa boli’ tathaa ‘vigyaan’ kaa arth he ‘vishesh gyaan’, kintu ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ shabd main prayukt in donon padon kaa spasht or vyapak arth samaj lene par hi ham is naam kii sargarbhitako jaanane main safal honge
 So, here we try to explain the broad meaning of both these terms
 bhashahmanav ek saamaajik praani he
 The need to convey our feelings and thoughts to each other in the society has been felt since time immemorial
 is prakaar bhashaa kaa astitva maanav samaaj main ati pracheen siddh hota he
 Language serves as an important tool for publishing the entire knowledge of human beings, to know the history of civilization and culture
 hamaare purvapurushon se sabhi saadhaaran or asaadhaaran anubhav ham bhashaa ke madhyam se hi jaan sake hai
 Knowledge from all our scriptures and scriptures is dependent on language
 mahakavi dandi ne apane mahaan granth ‘kavyadarsh’ main bhashaa kii mahatta suchit karte hue likhaa haih- That is, this entire Bhuvan would have become dark, if the word-form light in the world was not the light of language
 spasht hi he ki yah kathan maanav bhashaa ko lakshya karke hi kaha gaya he
 The sounds that animals and birds take shelter to express their expressions may be language for them, but due to being ambiguous to humans, scholars have called it 'latent speech', which is language- Nothing matters from the point of view of science
 kyonki ‘avyakt vaak’ main shabd or arth donon hi aspasht bane rahete hai
 Humans also sometimes use signs of limbs, fidgeting, hand-to-feet, face etc
 to express their feelings, but in spite of being a language, it is not 'express speech'
 maanav bhashaa kii sabase badi visheshta yah hoti he ki vah ‘vyakt vaak’ arthath shabd or arth kii spashtataa liye hue hoti he
 According to Patanjali, the author of Mahabhashya, 'express speech' refers to the descriptive language
 yah satya he ki kabhi-kabhi sanketon or angabhangimaaon kii sahaayta se bhi hamaare bhav or vichaaron kaa preshan badi saralata se ho jaataa he
 In this way, those gestures become symbols of language, but the most appropriate means of expressing human emotion is the descriptive language which has been given the noun of 'express speech'
 is main vibhinn arthon ko prakat karne ke liye kuch nischit uccharit yaa kathith dhvaniyon kaa aashray liya jaataa he
 Therefore, language is called a group of words which are filled with signs of different meanings
 jinke dwaara ham apane manobhaav saralata se dusron ke prati prakat kar sakate hai
 Thus, while defining the language, we can call it a medium adopted to exchange thoughts and expressions in human society, which holds the meaningful basis for the sounds that have been effortlessly ejected from the utterances of humans
 wo dhwani-samooh shabd kaa rup tab lete hai jab ve kisi arth se jud jate hai
 Entire phonology is based on a 'random' relationship with its meaning
 ‘yadrichhik’ kaa arth he purnataya kalpit
 In short, we call that word group pronounced with different meanings expressed in different meanings through which we convey our feelings and thoughts to others
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke adhyayan se hamen anek laabh hote hai, jaise- 1

 bhashaa, lipi aadi main saralata, shuddhta aadi kii drushti se parivartan-parivardhan main sahaayta
 In view of all these benefits, linguistics is considered to be a very useful subject in today's era, and its field of study is constantly developing
 bhashaa ek prakritik vastu he jo maanav ko ishwariya vardaan ke rup main mili hui he
 Language is formed by naturally sounding sounds from the mouth of man
 bhashaa kaa saamaanya gyaan iske bolne or sunne vaale sabhi ko ho jaataa he
 This is called general knowledge of language
 iske aage, bhashaa kab bani, kaise bani ? iskaa praarambhik evam pracheen swaroop kya tha ? isamen kab-kab, kya-kya parivartan hue or un parivartanon ke kya kaaran hai ? athwa kul milakar bhashaa kaise viksit hui ? us vikaas ke kya kaaran hai ? koun si bhashaa kis duusari bhashaa se kitni samanta yaa vishmata rakhti he ? yah sab bhashaa kaa vishesh gyaan yaa ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ kaha jayega
 This particular form of linguistics, ie linguistics, has been considered as an important subject of study today
 bhashaa-vigyaan jab adhyayan ke vishyon main badi-badi kakshaon ke paathyakramon ke antargat sammilit kiya gaya to sarvapratham yah ek swaabhaavik prashn utpann hua ki bhashaa-vigyaan ko kala ke antargat gina jaae yaa vigyaan main
 That is, linguistics is art or science
 adhyayan kii prakriya evam nishkarshon ko lekar nishchay kiya jane laga ki vastutah use bhautik vigyaan, evam rasayan vigyaan aadi kii bhanti vishuddh vigyaan mana jaae athwa chitra, sangeet, murti, kavy aadi kalaon kii bhanti kala ke rup main sweekaar kiya jaae
 Art is related to human beings objects or subjects
 yahi kaaran he ki kala vyakti pradhan yaa purnatah vaiyaktik hoti he
 Apart from being relative, a particular country and period also have an influence on art
 iskaa abhipraay yah he ki kisi kaal main kala ke prati jo mulya rahete hai unamem kaalaantar main naye-naye parivartan upasthit ho jate hai tathaa ve kisi duusare desh main bhi maan liye jaaen, yah bhi aavashyak nahin he
 a person is feeling high artistic expression in an object
 kintu duusare ko vah is prakaar kii na lag rahi ho
 Therefore, the perception of art varies from person to person
 kala kaa sambandh maanav hriday kii ragatmik vritti se hota he
 There is a mixture of aesthetics of the person in it
 kala kaa uddeshy bhi soundaryanubhuti karana, yaa anand pradaan karnaa he, kisi vastu kaa tathvik vishleshan karnaa nahin
 The test of all these characteristics of the nature of art shows that linguistics is not art
 kyonki uskaa sambandh hriday kii sarasata-vritti se na hokar buddhi kii tatvagrahi drushti se hota he
 The aim of linguistics is not to provide beauty or entertainment
 vah to hamaare bauddhik chintan ko prakhar banaata he
 Elemental assessment of the existence of language
 uskaa drushtikon buddhivaadee he
 The findings of linguistics do not change on the basis of any person, nation or period and the basic basis of the study of linguistics, which is language, is not a humanized substance
 atah bhashaa-vigyaan ko ham kala ke kshetra main nahin gin sakate
 The usefulness of linguistics is that it teaches the art of language teaching
 isi kaaran sweet ne vyakaran ko bhashaa ko kala tathaa vigyaan donon kaha he
 Pure pronunciation, effective use of language can be placed in the category of art
 bhashaa-vigyaan ko kala kii seemaa main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa, yah nishchay ho jane par yah prashn uthta he ki kya bhashaa-vigyaan, bhautik-shaastra, rasayan-vigyaan aadi vishyon kii bhanti purnatah vigyaan he ? In the belief of many scholars, linguistics is not a pure science
 unki dharna ke anusaar abhi bhashaa-vigyaan ke sabhi prayog purnataa ko praapt nahin hue hai or uske nishkarshon ko isiilie antim nishkarsh nahin kaha ja saktaa
 At the same time, not all conclusions of linguistics are as universal and eternal as science
 jis prakaar ganit shaastra main 2 + 2 = 4 saarvkalik, vikalparahit nishkarsh he jo sarvatra sweekaar kiya jaataa he, bhashaa-vigyaan ke paas is prakaar ke vikalp-rahit nirvivaad nishkarsh nahin he
 In science, facts are compiled and analyzed, and the laws of sound are mostly non-committal, so according to some scholars, linguistics can be placed between humanities and science
 vichaar karne par ham dekhte hai ki vigyaan kii aaj kii durat pragati main prayek vishesh gyaan apane aagaamee gyaan ke saamne purana or avaigyanik siddh hota ja rahaa he
 In today's era of continual innovators, the scientific view is constantly going from micro to micro and new to new
 aaj ke viksit gyaan-kshetra ko dekhte hue kai vaigyanik manyataayen puraani or feeki pad gai he
 Newton's theory of light is also now being viewed with suspicion
 isse yah siddh hota ho jaataa he ki nutan gyaan ke prakaash main puraatan gyaan bhi vigyaan ke kshetra se baahar kar diya jaataa he
 Therefore, considering it from the point of view of pure knowledge, we find linguistics within the range of science itself
 bhashaa-vigyaan nishchay hi ek vigyaan he jiske antargat ham bhashaa kaa vishesh gyaan praapt karte hai
 It is true that linguistics has not yet been fully developed on a scientific level
 yahi kaaran he ki prasiddh grim-niyam ke aage chal kar grassmaan or varnor ko usamen sudhaar karnaa padaa he
 Prior to the above reforms, the sound rule of Grimm was considered to be the definite rule and even after the reforms it is considered to be the definite rule
 is prakaar naye gyaan ke prakaash main puraane siddhanton kaa khandan hone se vigyaan kaa koi virodh nahin he
 Actually this is pure science
 san 1930 ke baad jahaan varnanaatmak bhashaa-vigyaan ko punah mahatva praapt hua, vahaan tab se lekar aaj tak drut gati main vikaas hua he
 Ever since new tests have started with the help of instruments in the field of sound and the conclusions obtained have started to be completely regular, since then linguistics has gradually started to be considered in the category of science
 vigyaan kii ek badi visheshta he uskaa prayogtmak hona
 After American scholar Baloom Field, American linguists have developed experimental linguistics with great intensity as a new method of linguistics with phonology and morphology etc
 is paddati ke antargat bhashaa-vigyaan prayogshaalaon kaa vishay banataa ja rahaa he or uske liye anek yantron kaa avishkaar ho gaya he
 Seeing this, this subject will definitely be called science, there is no doubt in it at all
 aajkal jabaki samaaj-vigyaan, manovigyaan aadi shastreey vishyon ke liye jahaan vigyaan shabd kaa prayog karne kii parampara chal padi he tab shuddh kaaran-kaary parampara par aadhaarit bhashaa-vigyaan ko vigyaan kahana kisi bhi drushti se anuchit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Dr
 Shyamsunder Das has written in his book Language Secret- mangal dev shastri ke shabdon main- This definition is given in Dr
 Bholanath Tiwari's 'linguistics' text as follows- upar di gai sabhi paribhaashaon par vichaar karne se gyaat hota he ki unamem paraspar koi antar nahin he
 In the definition of Dr
 Shyamsunder Das, where the focus has been on linguistics only, Mangaldev Shastri and Bholanath Tiwari have included the types of study of linguistics in their definitions
 paribhaasha vah acchhee hoti he jo sankshipt ho or spasht ho
 Thus, we can give a new definition of linguistics in this way - "the study by which the study of human languages is subtle and analytical is called linguistics
" ” In other words, linguistics is that in which subtle and extensive scientific study of human languages is done
 bhashaa ke prachlit vartmaan swaroop ko chhod kar shesh sari adhyayan saamagree bhashaa-vigyaan ko sahitya se hi uplabdh hoti he
 If Sanskrit, Greek and Avesta literature were not in front of us today, linguistics would never have been successful in knowing that these three languages originated from any one native language
 isi prakaar adikaal se lekar aadhunik kaal tak kaa hindi sahitya hamaare saamne na hota to bhashaa-vigyaan hindi bhashaa ke aitihaasik vikaas kaa adhyayan kis prakaar kar paata
 Linguistics to study language in any way, he has to take help of literature on foot
 bundelkhand ke natkhat baalkon ke munh se yah sun kar- The grammar says what a problem this is, only the study of ancient literature will tell him that this is the impaired form of the first sutra of Shaktayan, 'un Namah Siddham'
 sahitya bhi bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta se apni anek samasyaon kaa samaadhaan khojane main safal ho jaataa he
 Dr
 Vasudev Sharan Aggarwal has clarified their meanings by linking many words of 'padmavat' with their original forms, validated on the basis of linguistic principles
 saath hi shuddh paath ke nirdhaaran main bhi isse paryaapt sahaayta lee he
 Hence, both literature and linguistics are supportive of each other
 bhashaa hamaare bhaavon-vichaaron arthath man kaa pratibimb hoti he atah bhashaa kii sahaayta se bahut se samasyaon ko suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Economics in particular is completely based on psychology
 vaakya-vigyaan ke adhyayan main bhi manovigyaan se paryaapt sahaayta milti he
 Sometimes psychology also helps us to know the cause of sound changes
 bhashaa kii utpatti tathaa praarambhik rup kii jaankaree main bhi bal-manovigyaan tathaa aviksit logon kaa manovigyaan hamaari sahaayta karata he
 Psychology also has to seek help from linguistics in its medical practice to know the meaning of the patient
 atah bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta se ek manovigyaani rogi kii manogranthiyon kaa pataa lagane main safal ho saktaa he
 Due to the close relationship between linguistics and psychology, a new study method is being developed nowadays called Language Psychology or Psycholinguistics
 bhashaa mukh se nikalne vaali dhwani ko kehete hai atah bhashaa-vigyaan main hawa bheetar se kaise chalati he, swaryantr, swartantri, nasikavivar, kauwa, taalu, daant, jeebh, onth, kanth, moorddha tathaa naak ke kaaran usamen kya parivartan hote hai tathaa kaan dwaara kaise dhwani grahan kii jaati he, in sabakaa adhyayan karnaa padataa he
 Physiology only helps him in this
 likhit bhashaa kaa grahan aankh dwaara hota he or is prakriya kaa adhyayan bhi bhashaa-vigyaan ke antargat hi hota he
 For this also he has to be indebted to physiology
 bhashaa-vigyaan or bhugol kaa bhi-gaharaa sambandh he
 According to some people, the geographical conditions of a place have a profound influence on its language
 kisi sthaan main boli jane vaali bhashaa main vahaan ke ped-paudhe, pakshi, jeev-jantu evam ann aadi ke liye shabd avashya milte hai parantu yadi unamem se kisi kii samaapti ho jaae to uskaa naam vahaan kii bhashaa se bhi juda ho jaataa hai
 The word 'somlata' is not used in our language today
 is lop kaa kaaran sambhavtah bhugolic hi he
 Geographic conditions are also the result of lack of a language spread in a place, less development in language and many dialects in a place
 durgam parvaton par rahane vaali jatiyon kaa paraspar kam sampark hone ke kaaran unki boli prasar nahin kar paati
 The dialect of people living across rivers differs from the common language
 deshon, nagaron, nadiyon tathaa praanton aadi ke naamon kaa bhashaa-vaigyanik adhyayan karne main bhugol badi manoranjak saamagree pradaan karata he
 Even in the field of economics, geography helps linguistics
 ‘ushtr’ kaa arth bhainsa se oont kaise ho gaya tathaa ‘saindhav’ kaa arth ghoda or namak hi kyon hua, aadi samasyaon par vichaar karne main bhi bhugol sahaayta karata he
 language-geography, a branch of linguistics, is just like geography
 isi prakaar kisi sthaan ke pragautihaasik kaal ke bhugol kaa adhyayan karne main bhashaa-vigyaan bhi paryaapt sahaayak hota he
 History is also closely related to linguistics
 itihaas ke teen roopon raajnneetik itihaas, dharmik itihaas, saamaajik itihaas-ko lekar yahan bhashaa-vigyaan se uskaa sambandh dikhalaayaa ja rahaa he- Other areas of knowledge like logic, physics and anthropology also provide great help in the study of linguistics
 manushya main anek prakaar ke andhvishwaas ghar kar lete hai jinka uski bhashaa par prabhaav padataa he
 In Indian society, women take their husbands' names in a twisted way, not outright
 raatri main vishaal keedon kaa naam nahin liya jaataa he
 They name their boy Mange, Chedi, Bechu, Ghurahu, Katwaru Alichar or Lendha, etc
 andhvishwaason ke atirikt anya bahut si saamaajik-manovigyaan se sambaddh gutthiyon ke spashtikaran ke liye maanav-vigyaan kii shakha-prashakhaon kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 In this way, many fields of knowledge- culture-studies, pedagogy, statistics, text-science, etc
 have a deep connection with linguistics
 maanav kii bhashaa kaa jo kshetra he vahi bhashaa-vigyaan kaa kshetra he
 The languages and dialects of civilized and uncivilized humans around the world are studied under linguistics
 is prakaar bhashaa-vigyaan keval sabhy-saahitiyik bhashaaon kaa hi adhyayan nahin karata apitu asabhy-barbar-asaahitiyik boliyon kaa, jo prachlan main nahin he, ateet ke garv main khoi hui hai un bhashaaon kaa bhi adhyayan iske antargat hota he
 Linguistics is divided into language structure and 'study of meaning' from the point of view of subject division
 isamen bhashaa kaa vaigyanik drushtikon se vishleshan or varnan karne ke saath hi vibhinn bhashaaon ke bich tulanaatmak adhyayan bhi kiya jaataa he
 Linguistics has two sides - elemental and applied
 iske atirikt bhashavigyaan kaa gyaan-vigyaan kii anyaanya shakhaon ke saath gaharaa sambandh he
 This has led to the development of various branches of sociolinguistics, psychodynamics, academic linguistics, etc
 bhashavigyaan ke gaun kshetra nimnlikhit hai- Syntax: In language, all thought-exchange is done on the basis of sentences
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke jis vibhaag main is par vichaar kiya jaataa he use vaakya-vichaar yaa vaakya-vigyaan kehete hai
 It has three forms - vaakya-rachana kaa sambandh bolanewaale samaaj ke manovigyaan se hota he
 Therefore this branch of linguistics is very difficult
 rup-vigyaan : vaakya kii rachana padon yaa roopon ke aadhaar par hoti he
 Therefore, the idea of verse or form becomes important after a sentence
 rup-vigyaan ke antargat dhaatu, upsarg, pratyay aadi un sabhi upkarnon par vichaar karnaa padataa he jinase rup banate hai
 Phonology: The base word of form or verse
 shabdon par rachana yaa itihaas in do drushtiyon se vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 The idea of a person or language is also done under it
 kosh-nirmaan tathaa vyutpatti-shaastra shabd-vigyaan ke hi vichaar-kshetra kii seemaa main aate hai
 The cultural history of the speaker can be known on the basis of the word group of the language
 dhwani-vigyaan : shabd kaa aadhaar he dhwani
 Sounds are studied in many ways under phonology
 iske antargat dhwani-shaastra ek alag se upavibhag he jisamen dhwani utpann karne vaale angon-mukh-vivar, nasika-vivar, swar tantri, dhwani yantra ke saath-saath sunne kii prakriya kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 There are two forms of this study - historical and second comparative
 grim niyam kaa sambandh isi se he
 Economics: The outer part of the sentence ends on the sound
 It is the outer body of the language, next to it the field of his soul begins which we call the meaning
 arth-rahit shabd atmarahit sharir kii bhanti vyarth hota he
 Therefore, meaning is an important part of language
 arth-vigyaan main shabdon ke arthon kaa vikaas tathaa uske kaarnon par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 We call any study a scientist when we follow a certain process in it
 bhashaa vigyaan bhi kisi bhashaa ke kaaran-kaaryparak yuktipurna vivechan-vishleshan ke liye kuch nishchit prakriyaaon main bandha kar chalata he
 On the basis of these processes, so far we have received five types of studies of linguistics- saamanyatya bhashaa kaa adhyayan nimnaankit drushtiyon se kiya jaataa he : By descriptive method, the form of one language of the same period is analyzed
 iske liye isamen un siddhanton par prakaash daalaa jaataa, jinke aadhaar par bhashaa-vishesh kii rachanaagat visheshtaon ko spasht kiya ja sake
 It is important to note that in this method language cannot be included in different periods simultaneously, because the analysis of language of every age will have the purpose of separate principles
 panini na keval bharat ke, apitu sansar ke sabase bade bhashavigyaani hai, jinhone varnanaatmak rup main bhashaa kaa vishad evam vyapak adhyayan kiya
 Katyayan and Patanjali also fall in this category
 greek vidwaanon main thraiks, discolas tathaa erodian ne bhi is kshetra main ullekhya kaary kiya tha
 Fully influenced by Panini, Bloomfield paved the way for the development of descriptive linguistics by publishing his book 'language' in 1932 AD
 idhar pashchimi deshon - visheshkar america main varnanaatmak bhashavigyaan kaa aashaatheet vikaas hua he
 The purpose of historical linguistics is to consider changes in different periods in a language and to formulate theories in relation to those changes
 varnanaatmak paddati kaa mul antar yah he ki varnanaatmak paddati jahaan ekakalik he, vahaan aitihaasik paddati dvikalik
 The antiquity of the Sanskrit language attracted the attention of linguists towards the historical method
 'filology' kaa mukhya pratipaadya pracheen granthon kii bhashaaon kaa tulanatamak adhyayan hi tha
 The focus of the scholars was mainly on languages like Sanskrit, German, Greek, Latin
 fredrick ougust woolf ne san 1777 i
 main hi aitihaasik paddati kii ore vidwaanon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya tha
 In fact, to understand the developmental form of any language one has to resort to historical method
 puraani hindi athwa madhyakaalin hindi or aadhunik hindi main kya parivartan hua he, ise aitihaasik paddati dwaara hi spasht kiya ja saktaa he
 Two or more languages are compared by comparative method
 ise mishrit paddati bhi kah sakate hai, kyonki vivarnaatmak paddati tathaa aitihaasik paddati donon kaa aadhaar liya jaataa he
 One has to define a period for description and at least two languages are required for comparison
 is prakaar, tulanaatmak paddati ko varnanaatmak paddati or aitihaasik paddati kaa yoga kaha ja saktaa he
 The comparative method can apply to any two languages
 jaise, bhartiya bhashaaon - bhojpuri aadi main bhi paraspar tulana kii jaati he yaa phir hindi-angareji, hindi-roosi, hindi-farsi kaa bhi tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 That is, there is no territorial limit
 wiliam jones, france bopp, maxmooler, curtius, ougust shlikhar prabhruti vidwaanon ne tulanaatmak bhashavigyaan ke vikaas main mahatvapurn yogadan kiya he
 However, so far there is a great lack of principles in comparative linguistics, on the basis of which the classification of two different languages could not become scientific
 sanrachanaatmak paddati varnanaatmak paddati kii agali kadi he
 This method is getting special publicity in America
 isamen yantric upkarnon ko adhik mahatva diya ja rahaa he, jisase anuwaad karne main vishesh suvidha hogi
 Jaelig Harris developed this method by writing a book titled 'methods in Structural Linguistics'
 vigyaan kii anya shakhaon ke samaan bhashavigyaan ke bhi prayogtmak paksh hai, jinke liye prayog kii pranaaliyon or prayogshaala kii apeksha hoti he
 Phonetic phonology, physical phonology and auditory phonology are studied by various mechanical experiments
 ise praayogic swanvigyaan, yantric swanvigyaan yaa prayogshaala swanvigyaan bhi kehete hai
 In this, from simple equipment like mirrors to the most complex electrical devices are being used

 Daniel Janse and Ida Ward have also done important work on English phonology
 francisi, german or roosi bhashaaon ke swanvigyaan par kaam karne waalon main kramash: armastrong, bithel or boyanas mukhya hai
 Among the people who work on theoretical and applied phonology equally, the following are the main ones: Stetson, Negus Potter, Green and Cop, Martin Juice, Hefner, Maul etc
