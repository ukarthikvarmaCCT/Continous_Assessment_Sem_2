 Over the last four centuries, many interpretations of the opera have been presented
 lekin parampara or anubhav ke aadhaar par yahi mana jaataa he ki opera ganabaddh naatak hota he, jisamen vaartalap ke sthaan par gaaya jaataa he
 The historical reason for this is that until the 16th century it was believed that the play should be in verse

 British ecologist Arthur Tansley later refined the term, describing it as "the whole system 


 not only the organism complex, but also the whole complex of all the physical factors that we call the environment"
 tansle paaritantron ko na keval prakritik ikaiyaan ke rup main, balki "maansik isolats" ke rup main bhi maanate the
 Tansley later defined the spatial extent of ecosystems using the term "ecotope"

 "he made a gesture of walking away from his friend, leaving the king humbly
 jab vah chalane ko hua to raja ne use rukne ko kaha
 Both hesitated and stopped
 vikram ne ek chaaku mangavaya tathaa pairon ke talvon ko khurachne lage
 The skin of the soles descended on the scraper and the lotus signs became clear from inside
 jyotishi ko hatprabh dekh vikram ne kaha- "he jyotishi maharaj, aapke gyaan main koi kami nahin he
 But your knowledge will remain incomplete till you boast your knowledge and keep checking it every now and then
 maine aapaki baaten sun leen thim or main hi jangal main lakadahare ke vesh main aapse mila tha

 isamen kisi achumbakeey padaarth ke urdhwadhar dhaanche par vidyutarodhi taanbe ke taar kii ek vrittakar kundali lagi rahati he
 The horoscope usually consists of 552 rounds, with connective screws after 2, 50 and 500 rounds
 inaki sahaayta se aavashyatanusaar kam yaa adhik chakkaron se kaam le sakate hai
 The circular coil can be rotated around the vertical axis
 kundali ke centre par ek chumbakeey sui urdhwadhar kilak par sadhi rahati he or sui ke lamberup ek aluminium kaa lanbaa sanketak laga rahata he, jo sooyee ke saath saath kshaitij vrittakar scale par ghumta he or chumbakeey sooyee kaa vikshep batalaata he
 The scale is divided into four quadrants and each quartile has signs ranging from 0 degrees to 90 degrees
 jab chumbakeey sooyee chumbakeey yamyottar main hoti he, to sanketak shunya ansh par rahata he
 Before measuring the current, you make the base of the dielectric horizontal and rotate the plane of the coil to the magnetic meridian
 is dasha main chumbakeey sui ke baks ko kundali ke centre par kshaijit sthiti main rakhte hai or yah bhi dekh lete hai ki sanketak ke donon sire 0 degree - 0 degree par sthit he ab dharamapi ke do sanyojak penchon ko us paripath main sambhddha kar dete hai jisamen dhara kaa pravaah hota he
 As the current flows in the vertical coil, a magnetic field is created, which forms a right angled horizontal earth magnetic field
 un donon chumbakeey kshetron ke kaaran chumbakeey sooyee par do vipareet disha main ghumaanevaale balyugma kaary karte hai
 The needle is deflected and stops in such a situation where the rotations of both the balugams are equal
 yadi sooyee kaa vikshep q ho, to dhara kaa maan nimna sutara se gyaat hota he : That is, the current flowing in the currentometer is proportional to the tangent of the deflection angle
 niyatank dharamapi kaa parivartan gunak kehalaata he
 The change multiplier is measured in amperes
 yah us vidyutdhara ke baraabar hota he, jo dharamapi kii sooyee main 45 degree kaa vikshep utpann kar sakati he
 This type of simple tangent dormometer is not sufficiently subtle and accurate
 vishesh rup se dhara ke kaaran chumbakeey kshetra kii tivrata chumbakeey sui ke donon dhruvon par ek si nahin hoti
 This leads to an error in the current, because the formula relies on having the same magnetic field at both poles
 isliye isi siddhant par aadhaarit ek doosraa dharamapi bana, jise helmholts galavenometer kehete hai
 This is not an error in the currentometer and it is much more sensitive than a simple tangentometer
 isamen achumbakeey padaarth ke do urdhwadhar dhaanchon par vrittakar kundaliyaan hoti hai
 The distance between their centers is equal to their radius
 chumbakeey sooyee kaa baks donon kundiliyon ke kshaitij aksh par thik bich main rakhaa jaataa he
 The wires of both the coils are connected in such a way that the magnetic fields produced from both are in the same direction when current flows in them
 aisa hone se chumbakeey sooyee ke paas dharaa se utpann chumbakeey kshetra adhik teevr ho jaataa he or yah bhi siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki is kshetra kii tivrata sooyee ke donon siron par ek si rahati he
 As a result of this change, this thermometer becomes more sensitive and accurate
 dhara naapane ke pehle sooyee ke baks ke samtal ko kshaitij karnaa or urdhwadhar kundaliyon ko chumbakeey yamyottar main karnaa aavashyak he
 After this adjustment, when current flows in the coil of the dielectric and there is an angle deflection in the magnetic needle, the value of the current is known by the following formula: g ko helmholts dharamapi kaa pavirthan gunak kehete hai
 This thermometer is also not sufficiently sensitive
 adhik sookshmagrahi dharamapi banane ke liye ek nayaa siddhant prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 That is, if the effect of the earth magnetic field is reduced on the magnetic needle, then any current will cause the magnetic needle to have greater deflection than before, meaning the device will become more sensitive
 isko asthaitik yugma kaa siddhant kehete hai
 If two nearly equal magnetic rotating magnets are attached to a rigid rod so that they are parallel to each other and their opposite poles are close together, they are called an inertial pair
 is yugma main donon chumbakon ke vipareet dhruv paas paas hote hai, is kaaran parthiv chumbakeey kshetra kaa prabhaav is yugma par bahut kam padataa he
 The coil or coils of the wire are wrapped around a magnet or both magnets in such a way that the currents are exerted on the magnets in the same direction
 is dasha main yadi kundaliyon main nune dhara bhi pravahit ha, ta bha chumbakeey yugma main adhik vikshep hota he
 This type of dielectric is very sensitive
 yadi is chumbakeey yugma ko ek anthnrahit latakan dwaara lataka diya jaae or is latakan main ek chota sa darpan laga diya jaae, to prakaash kiran dwaara ati sakshm vikshep napa ja saktaa he
 The rays of light are reflected from the mirror of the photometer by moving from the lamp and come into focus on a scale by a lens
 jab dhara pravaah ke kaaran chumbakeey yugma main vikshep hota he or darpan kone q dwaara ghumta he, to parvartit prakaash kirne kone 2Q main gumti hai or scale par prakashabindu main sthanantaran ho jaataa he
 By this method, the micro-deflection of the needle can be measured and as a result, the extreme current can be measured with this thermometer
 asthaitik chumbakeey yugma kaa prayog kai prakaar se vibhinn naamon ke dharamapiyon main kiya gaya he
 Calvin Dharmapi, Pashen Dharmapi and Broca Dharmapi are some examples
 in dharamapiyon se 10-12 ampiore tak kii dhara naapi ja sakati he
 a hydrometer is a thermometer, especially an inertometer, is very sensitive, but it is inconvenient to use
 ye asthaayee bhi hote hai
 This is why they are rarely used
 adhiktar chalkundal dharamapi kaa hi upyog hota he, kyonki ye yathesht sookshmagrahi hone ke atirikt, sthaayee, saral tathaa suvidhajanak hote hai

 vikhyath vaigyanik habal ne apane nirikshanon se brahmadavidya kii ek nai prakriya kaa pataa lagaaya
 Hubble tested the light coming from the far-flung sky Ganges and explained that the vibrations of light waves increase as they reach the Earth
 yadi is prakaash kaa varnapat praapt karen to varnapat kaa jhukaav laal rang kii ore adhik hota he
 This process is called the Doppler effect
 dhwani sambandhi dopalar prabhaav se bahut log parichit honge
 When we look at the Doppler effect in the context of light, the light coming from far away has a blue tilt and the light from a distant light source has a tilt to red
 is prakaar habal ke nirikshanon se yah maaloom hua ki akaash gangaaen hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Hubble also stated that their speed of movement away from Earth is proportional to their distance from Earth

 Kalibangan also has brick platforms in the south part of the city which may have been made for the cellars
 is prakaar yah spasht hota he ki kothaar hadappa samskruti ke abhinn ang the

 yahaan ke wanon se inte pakaane or imaarat banane ke liye lakdi bade paimaane par istemaal main laai gai jiske kaaran dhire dhire wanon kaa vistaar simatata gaya
 One of the reasons for the fertility of Indus was the floods coming from the Indus River every year

 An idol depicts a plant growing out of a woman's womb
 vidwaanon ke mat main yah prithvi devi kii pratimaa he or iskaa nikat sambandh paudhon ke janm or vruddhi se rahaa hoga

 lekin pracheen misr kii tarah yahaan kaa samaaj bhi matra pradhan tha ki nahin yah kahana mushkil he

 anek bhashaaon ke gyaata tathaa pragatisheel vichaardhaara ke sahityakar nagarjun ne hindi ke atirikt maithili sanskrit evam bangla main moulik rachanaayen bhi kin tathaa sanskrit, maithili evam bangla se anuwaad kaary bhi kiya
 Nagarjuna, conferred with the Sahitya Akademi Award, wrote in Maithili under the passenger surname and the surname was merged with his original name Vaidyanath Mishra
 nagarjun kaa janm 1911 i0 kii jyeshtha poornima ko vartmaan madhubani jile ke satlakha main hua tha
 This was his infancy
 unka paitruk gaanv vartmaan darbhanga jile kaa tarauni tha
 His father's name was Gokul Mishra and mother's name was Uma Devi
 nagarjun ke bachapan kaa naam 'thakkan misar' tha
 Actually the thing was that Gokul Mishra and Uma Devi had four children continuously and they all died untimely
 santan na jeene ke kaaran gokul mishra ati nirashapurna jivan main rah rahe the
 Uneducated Brahmin Gokul Mishra was naturally loyal to God, but those days he started worshiping his adorable Lord Shankar Lord more and more
 vaidyanath dham jaakar baba vaidyanath kii unhone yathashakti upasna kii or vahaan se lautne ke baad ghar main puja-paath main bhi samay lagane lage
 "then, when the fifth child was born, there was also a fear in the mind that like the four children, this too would be cheated and settled in some time
 atah ise 'thakkan' kaha jane laga
 After a long time, this Thakkan was named and after the grace and blessings of Baba Vaidyanath, this child was named Vaidyanath Mishra
 " Gokul Mishra's financial condition was not good
 ve kaam-dham kuch karte nahin the
 All the land was given on the share and when difficulties arose due to reduced yield, they were tempted to sell the land
 jameen bechakar kai prakaar kii galat aadaten paal rakhi thim
 At the last moment of his life, Gokul Mishra left only three kattas of fertile land and almost the same habitat for his successor, that too with interest
 bahut baad main nagarjun danpati ne use chhudaaya
 In such a family situation, child Vaidyanath Mishra grew up
 chah varsh kii aayu main hi unki mata kaa dehanth ho gaya
 His father used to sit with his only motherless son on his shoulder and used to visit this village - that village
 is prakaar bachapan main hi inhen pita kii laachaari ke kaaran ghoomane kii aadat pad gayi or bade hokar yah ghoomana unke jivan kaa swaabhaavik ang ban gaya
 "the stroller molecule, which entered the body during childhood itself, developed and strengthened like composition and religion
 " The early education of Vaidyanath Mishra started with the help of small principles Kaumudi and Amarkosh in the above family situation
 us jamaane main mithilanchal ke dhani apane yahaan nirdhan medhaavi chaatro ko prashray diya karte the
 At this age, child Vaidyanath saw many villages in Mithilanchal
 baad main vidhivat sanskrit kii padhai banaras jaakar shuru kii
 At the same time, he was influenced by the Arya Samaj and then leaned towards Buddhist philosophy
 un dinon raajnneeti main subhash chandra bose unke priy the
 As a Buddhist he considered Rahul Sankrityayan as the pioneer
 banaras se nikalakar kolkata or phir dakshin bharat ghoomte hue lanka ke vikhyath 'vidyalankar pariven' main jaakar buddha dharm kii diksha lee
 Rahul and Nagarjuna are 'guru Bhai'

 In the middle of 1938, he returned from Lanka
 phir aarambh hua unka ghumkkad jivan
 Along with literary works, Nagarjuna also directly participated in political movements
 swami sahjanand se prabhavit hokar unhone bihar ke kisaan andolan main bhaag liya or maar khaane ke atirikt jail kii sajaa bhi bhugti
 He also participated in the peasant movement of Champaran
 vastutah ve rachanaatmak ke saath-saath sakriy pratirodh main vishwaas rakhte the
 Participating in the JP movement in April 1974, he said, "A public war is going on against the evils of the establishment, in which my participation is not only of speech but of karma, that's why i am on hunger strike today, tomorrow also in jail
" i can go " or sachmuch is andolan ke silsile main apat sthiti se purv hi inhen giraftaar kar liya gaya or phir kaaphi samay jail main rahanaa padaa
 In 1948, for the first time, Nagarjuna suffered from an asthma attack and then he suffered from time to time due to lack of proper treatment
 do putriyon evam chaar putron se bhare-puure parivaar vaale nagarjun kabhi garhasthya dharm thik se nahin nibhaa paye or is bhare-puure parivaar ke paas achal sampatti ke rup main viraasat main mili vahi teen kattha upjau tathaa praayah utani hi vaas-bhoomi rah gayi
 Nagarjuna's real name was Vaidyanath Mishra, but in Hindi literature, he composed compositions in Nagarjuna and Maithili with the traveler surname
 kaashi main rahete hue unhone 'vaideh' upnaam se bhi kavitaayen likhi thim
 In 1936, he took the name 'nagarjuna' in 'vidyalankar Pariven' in Sinhala
 aarambh main unki hindi kavitaayen bhi 'yatri' ke naam se hi chhapi thim
 In fact, after 1941 AD, at the request of some friends, he had decided not to write in Hindi by any name other than Nagarjuna
 nagarjun kii pehali prakashit rachana ek maithili kavita thi jo 1929 i0 main laheriasarai, darbhanga se prakashit 'mithila' naamak patrika main chhapi thi
 His first Hindi work was a poem called 'ram ke Prati' which appeared in the weekly 'vishwabandhu' originating from Lahore in 1934
 nagarjun lagbhag adsath varsh tak rachanakarm se jude rahe
 Poetry, novels, story, memoirs, travelogues, essays, children's literature - he used pen in all genres
 maithili evam sanskrit ke atirikt bangla se bhi ve jude rahe
 Nagarjuna's attachment to Bengali language and literature was there from the very beginning
 kaashi main rahete hue unhone apane chaatr jivan main bangla sahitya ko mul bangla main padhanaa shuru kiya
 Originally writing poetry started in February 1978, and by September 1979, about 50 poems had been written
 kuch rachanaayen banglaa kii patr-patrikaon main bhi chhapin
 Some were published in Hindi short magazines including transliteration and translation
 moulik rachana ke atirikt unhone sanskrit, maithili or bangla se anuwaad kaary bhi kiya
 Kalidas was his most loved poet and 'meghdoot' favorite book
 meghdoot kaa muktchand main anuwaad unhone 1953 i0 main kiya tha
 He had done the praises of Jayadev's 'geet Govind' only in 1948 AD
 vastutah 1944 or 1954 i0 ke bich nagarjun ne anuwaad kaa kaaphi kaam kiya
 a Hindi translation of several novels and stories of the Bengali novelist Sharat Chandra was also published
 kanhaiyalaal maniklal munshi ke upanyaas 'prithveevallabh' kaa gujarati se hindi main anuwaad 1945 i0 main kiya tha
 In 1965, he had praised Vidyapati's hundred songs
 baad main vidyapati ke or geeton kaa bhi unhone anuwaad kiya
 Apart from this, he had also narrated the thirteen stories of Vidyapati's 'purush-exam' which was published in 1964 by the name 'vidyapati's stories'
 aasmaan main chandaa taire -1982 i Military Old Horse - 1997 nagarjun ke kavy main ab tak kii puri bhartiya kavy-parampara hi jeevant rup main upasthit dekhi ja sakati he
 His poet-personality, Kalidas and Vidyapati, many of the classic poets - deep exploration of the world, practical followings of multi-faceted philosophies such as Buddhism and Marxism and above all a deep connection to the problems, concerns and struggles of our time and environment, and deep recognition of folk culture and folklore
 Is made from unka ‘yatripan’ bhartiya maanas evam vishay-vastu ko samgr or sachche rup main samajhane kaa saadhan rahaa he
 Apart from Maithili, Hindi and Sanskrit, knowledge of many languages like Pali, Prakrit, Bangla, Sinhalese, Tibetan etc
 has also been helpful for them in this purpose
 unka gatisheel, sakriy or patibaddh sudeergh jivan unke kavy main jeevant rup se pratidhwanit-pratibimbit he
 Nagarjuna is a modern poet in the true sense of Indian soil
 unhone azaadi ke pehle or baad main bhi kai bade janandolanon main bhaag liya tha
 Between 1939 and 1942, he was imprisoned in Bihar for leading a demonstration by farmers
 azaadi ke baad lambe samay tak wo patrakarita se bhi jude rahe
 These three qualities are not only found in Nagarjuna's personality, but also in his literature
 niraala ke baad nagarjun akele aise kavi hai, jinhone itane chand, itane dhang, itani sheliyaan or itane kavy roopon kaa istemaal kiya he
 He is a unique poet who uses traditional poetic forms with new texts and makes possible new poetic skills
 unke kuch kavy shilpon main taak-jhaank karnaa hamaare liye moolyawaan ho saktaa he
 His manner of expression is oblique, very typical and straightforward
 apni tiryaktaa main ve jitne bejod hai, apni vagmita main ve utane hi vilakshan hai
 There is no impediment in using poetic forms
 unki kavita main ek pramukh style swagat main mukt baatcheet kii style he
 If you borrow the verse from Nagarjuna's poem, then you can say - The seeds are contained in the world of grief
 bhashaa par baba kaa gazab adhikaar he
 There are many levels of their language, from the typical words of the Desi dialect to the Sanskritic classical term
 unhone to hindi ke alaava maithili, bangla or sanskrit main alag se bahut likhaa he
