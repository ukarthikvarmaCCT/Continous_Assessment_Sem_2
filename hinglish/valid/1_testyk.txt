 This term was given by Wiener Norbert to describe the new science of information and control in animals and machines
 Weiner did his initial work on noise
 siburnetics vigyaani gordan pask ne kaha ki truti jo sahaayak tantra ko badhaava detii he, use sahaayak tantra main anurupi avadharanaon ke yugma: vartmaan sthiti or lakshya sthiti, ke bich ek antar ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 He later suggested the error could be seen as an innovation or a paradox dependent on the context and perspective of interaction participants
 Stafford Beer, founder of Management Cybernetics, applied these ideas to his viable system model
 jeev vigyaan main jab jaankaree kii nakal thik prakaar se nahin kii jaati tab aisa kaha jaataa he kii truti hui he
 For example, in asexual reproductive species, it is termed an error if the DNA nucleotides of the parent and child differ
 is arth main truti ko "acchhee" yaa "buree" kii shrenee main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa, haalanki is prakaar kii truti ek jeev ko iske paryaavaran ke liye kam yaa adhik anukulit bana sakati he
 In baseball, the error is determined by the scoring official, when a runner makes a mistake in fielding and it causes an obstacle in the correct game, or the game does not proceed properly
 This is called a physical mistake
 maansik taur par agar galat faisla diya jaataa he to ise truti nahin kaha jaataa
 ek die gaye khel main ek se zyada out hone main asafalataa ko truti nahin kaha jaataa he
 The application of this rule is necessarily subjective
 dak tikat sangrah main, truti ek ek postage stamp main yaa kisi postal steshnari main ho sakati he, yah chapai yaa utpaadan main hui galati hoti he, jisaki vajah se yah saamaanya namoonay se yaa icchit parinaam se alag dikhaai detaa he
 Examples of this are the use of the wrong color in the stamp or the absence of one or more of the desired colors, the vignette being splashed upside down from its frame, forming holes without holes on one or more sides despite the usual stamp, or incorrect Printing on type paper
 Legal errors should always be made and sold inadvertently
 aisi trutiyaan kam yaa durlabh ho sakati hai yaa nahin ho sakati hai
 a mistake in the design of a stamp is called a design error, such as a mistake in the subject, even if there is no mistake in printing or production

 " In numismatics, the term error is used to refer to a coin or a medal that has some error in the casting, a similar error to that seen in postage stamps
 kyonki america taksaal beuro sabhi sambhav trutiyon par najar rakhata he, isliye america sikkon par trutiyaan bahut durlabh hoti hai or aamtaur par bahut kam hoti hai
 Examples of coin-related errors are: the addition of some extra metal to one coin, the coin being sliced, double stamping on a coin when the coin-making machine does the casting of another coin very quickly
 a date mistake in the coin, such as 1942 / 41, is also considered an error
 norman ne tark diya ki kyonki truti aprihaary he, 'diziner' ko truti ke kaaran ko kam se kam karne kaa prayaas karnaa chahie, kisi galat karrwai ko andu karne kaa prayaas karnaa chahie, aise tareeke khojane kii koshish kerani chahie jisase trutiyon ko thik kiya ja sake

 The common concept about reporting error is that first of all, everyone should accept that it is normal to make a mistake and it cannot be used against any one iske alaava, agar adhik trutiyon ko report kiya jaataa he or un par charchaa kii jaati he to ise adhik protsaahit kiya janaa chahie taaki anya galatiyon ko report karke unka samaadhaan kiya ja sake
 Jones states that technological movements have a positive effect on error correction because of better communication
 takneekee sudhaar ek samaan soch ko prerit karte hai or pranaaliyon ko adhik behatar banane ke liye protsaahit karte hai
 Through this, error correction can be maximized

 In mathematics, computer science, telecommunications, and information theory, error correction has a very precise meaning, which is discussed in an article called error detection and modification

 The following were the reasons for the American Civil War- sanyukt rajya america ke uttari rajyon kii sthiti jananaankeey evam aarthik drushti se apekshaakrit majboot thi
 Out of the 34 states of the Union, 23 states were included in the north and 2 / 3 of the total population of the country lived in the north, with a very small number of slaves
 uttari rajyon main udyogon kii pradhanta thi
 In industries, cotton, woolen garments, leather goods etc
 were produced on a large scale
 in kaarkaanon main mazdooron dwaara mashiinon se utpaadan hota tha, atah yahaan gulaamon evam daason kaa vishesh mahatv nahin tha
 On the other hand, the economic life of the southern states of America was based on agriculture and there was not much use of machines in agriculture
 atah in rajyon ke kisaan kheti ke liye gulaamon ke shram par nirbhar the
 In the south, cotton, sugarcane and tobacco were cultivated on a large scale in which slaves worked as laborers
 atah dakshin kaa samaaj purna rup se daason par nirbhar tha
 In this way, the southern state was distinguished from the northern and western parts due to its characteristics, the prevalent slave system and plantation system prevalent there
 dakshini rajya-varjeenia se lekar dakshini carolina hote hue georgia tak ek pattee ke rup main faile the
 Thus, due to economic disparity, there was a big difference in economic life, political ideology and social status of the northern and southern states

 atah unhen yah mahasoos hua ki sangh kaa prayog uttari america ke hiton ke liye kiya ja rahaa he or dakshini rajyon ke prati upeksha kii drushti rakhi ja rahi he
 In the northern states of America, slaves had no decisive role in economic life
 atah unke liye daason kaa mahatv gaun tha duusari taraf america ke dakshini rajyon main das pratha janajivan main ghul chuki thi
 In the southern states, the issue of slavery was always sensitive
 jab kabhi anya rajyon me das pratha par lage pratibandh ko in dakshini, rajyon main lagu karne kii uthi to in rajyon ne ise apni prabhusatta par akraman mana
 In fact, slavery was seen as a stigma on humanity in the northern states and the demand to abolish it was raised
 samachar-patron main madhyam se is das virdohi bhaavana ko ubhaara gaya
 On the other hand the issue of slaves for the southern states was linked to profitability
 unka tark tha ki das pratha main shramik sanghathanon, hadataalon aadi kaa bhay nahin tha tathaa uttari rajyon ke mazdooron kii tulana main ve daason ko adhik suvidha pradaan karte hai
 On the basis of this mindset and arguments, the southern states considered slavery to be necessary
 uttari-america main to das vyapaar samaapt kar diya gaya tha or das pratha uttar main pencilvenia kii dakshini seemaa tak band ho gai thi
 This boundary line was called the "mesum-dixon" boundary
 ab america kaa pashchimi kshetron main vistaar ho rahaa tha or nae-nae kshetra sanyukt rajya america main shaamil kiye ja rahe the
 In such a situation a question arose whether these states should be included as a slave state or as an independent state
 yah mudda isliye bhi mahatvapurn tha kyonki samvidhan main yah sweekaar kiya gaya tha ki sangheey vyavasthapika main daason kii gananaa bhi hoti thi kintu daason kii jansankhya ko 3 / 5 ke ausat main pratinidhitiv diya jaataa tha arthath daason kii jansankhya yadi 500 hogi to use 300 maanakar pratinidhitiv diya jane laga
 Thus, with the increase in the number of slave states, there was a danger of increasing the dominance of slave states in the administration
 isliye naveen rajyon ke vilay ke sandarbh main uttari america use swatantra rajya ke rup main shaamil karnaa chahta tha jabaki dakshini rajya use das rajya ke rup main
 The dispute deepened over the merger of the state of Missouri
 atah 1820 i

 Under this, Missouri was incorporated into the Union as a slave state and it was stated that slavery would not continue in Louisiana, an area north of 36030 'latitude
 iske baad sangh main texas ke vilay kaa prastaav aayaa
 Texas eventually joined the Union in 1845 as a slave state
 phir california ke mudde par vivaad hua or antat california ko 1850 main swatantra rajya ke rup main sammilit kiya gaya
 It was fiercely opposed in the southern states
 ab unhen santusht karne ke liye ek “bhagoda das” kanoon laayaa gaya jiske tahat bhaage hue das ko punah pakadaa ja saktaa tha
 This law was opposed by the northern states as they gave shelter to fugitive slaves
 kintu 1854 main cansus evam nebraska ke vilay ke prashn ne vivaad ko or gaharaa diya
 In fact, these two states were located 30 degrees 30 minutes north and according to the Missouri Accord they were to be included as independent states, but with the effort of a politician named Stephen Douglas, these states were incorporated as slave states
 is tarah rajyon ke vilay ke prashn ne uttari evam dakshini rajyon ke madhya khai ko or chaudaa kar diya
 In 1860, the Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln won and in 1861 he assumed the position of President
 republican party ne das pratha kii aalochana kii thi or yah party swatantra shram vichaardhaara main vishwaas rakhti thi
 Lincoln's victory, therefore, seemed inauspicious to the southern states
 unhen laga ki yah jeet dakshin ke aarthik hiton ke anukool nahin he
 So the first reaction in the southern states was made by the state of Carolina and it announced its separation from the Union
 farvari, 1861 tak mississippi, florida, albama, georgia, lulasiana va texas ne bhi sangh se viched kar jeffrasan davis ko apana raashtrapati niyukt kiya or isi ke saath grihayuddh kii shuruuaat ho gai, jab dakshini carolina se sumter ke kile par bam phenk sangh ke viruddh yuddh ched diya
 The separation of the Union by the Southern States raised an important constitutional question whether the Southern States had the right to secede from the Union? Lincoln, after his election to the presidency, declared unequivocally that the union that was established as the United States of America was unbroken and eternal, that its indefensibility would not be allowed to perish
 america samvidhan nirmaataaon ne kisi rajya ko sangh se pruthak hone kaa adhikaar nahin diya he
 Lincoln declared that "if we can save the union by freeing all slaves, we will do so if we can save the union without freeing slaves, and we will do so if by freeing some slaves and not freeing others If we can save the union, we will do that too
 " is tarah linkan ne sangh ko bachaae rakhane kaa prayaas kiya
 During the war, it did not allow the southern states to have relations with foreign countries through diplomatic skill
 usne senaaon ko sangathit kar dakshin ke sashastr sangharsh kii chunauti ko todaa
 From the very beginning, he said that the main goal of the armies was not to take authority over the southern region, but to expand the armies of the Confederation
 1861 i

 makar sakranti ke din hua tha
 Then it is a strange coincidence that he died on June 14, 1918, on the day of raja-sankranti
 inkaa aavirbhaav hua tha sakranti main or tirbhaav bhi sakranti main
 For this reason, Fakirmohan has become known as "sankranti-purush" in Odia literature-world

 His life was serious with pain and suffering
 parantu dusron ke mukh main unhone aisi hasya-bhangi nikhaar dikhalaayi, jisaki koi tulana nahin

 His Saraswat enterprise continued for the liberation of the farmers from the exploitation of the capitalists

 Artificial intelligence began in the 1950s
 ye sanganak or sanganak prograamon ko unheen tarkon ke aadhaar par chalaane kaa prayaas hota he jiske aadhaar par maanav mastishk chalate hai
 The purpose of artificial intelligence is to be able to decide on its own what the next activity will be
 iske liye sanganak ko alag-alag paristhitiyon ke anusaar apni pratikriya chunane ke liye program kiya jaataa he
 The effort behind this is that the computer can copy the thinking process of human

 AI can be divided into four parts
 1- insaan kii tarah sochna 2- insaan kii tarah vyavhaar karnaa 3- tark evam vichaaro yukt matlab sanvadensheel, budhimaan, tathyon ko samajhnaa evam tark evam vichaaron par apni pratikriya bhi dena
 In this way we can say that by artificially developing a system that can act like a human, can think and give its response

 In recent years, understanding of human thinking is developing so fast that the creation of nature is being challenged in every field

 This marriage was a union of two cultures
 devraj indra naag kanya madhavi par mohit tha tathaa usase vivaah rachaakar nagvansha ko apane saath karnaa chahta tha parantu isamen unako safalataa nahin mili
 This created a dislike for Maharaj Agrasen in his mind and stopped the rain in his kingdom

 On this, Maharaj Agrasen attacked Devraj Indra
 maharaja agrasen ke paas jo naitik bal tha uske saamne devraj indra kii sena nahin tik pai or ghabara kar yuddh se bhaag gaya

 They saw a lioness giving birth to a child in the bush
 maharaja agrasen ke lavalashkar ko dekhakar uske prasav main baandha padi tathaa kuch hi kshachhvako main sinhani ke praan pakheru ud gaye

 maharaja agrasen ji is drishy se kaaphi prabhavit hue tathaa unke dimag main yah baat baith gai ki nishchay hi yah vir bhoomi he or yahaan janm lene vaale log vir, parakramee evam saahsee honge
 Inspired by this inspiration, he decided to establish the capital of his kingdom on this land and named it Agrodhak which is nowadays known as Agroha

 There was no distinction between poor and elevated in the kingdom of Maharaja Agrasen
 apane rajya main har nae aane vaale vyakti ko evam mudra evam eent bhent swaroop dene kii parampara kaayam kii taaki sabhi samaan hokar rahen
 This civilization and culture influenced not only Indian society but also abroad
