 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The Upanishads are important Shruti scriptures of Hinduism
 ye vaidic vaanmay ke abhinn bhaag hai
 It gives a very philosophical and knowledgeable description of the nature and relationship of God, god-brahma and soul
 upanishdon main karmkand ko 'avar' kahkar gyaan ko isliye mahatv diya gaya ki gyaan sthool se sookshm kii ore le jaataa he
 Knowledge of Brahma, Jiva and Jagat is the basic education of Upanishads
 bhagavadgita tathaa brahmasutra upanishdon ke saath milakar veydant kii 'prasthaantrayee' kehalaate hai
 The Upanishads are the basic source of all Indian philosophies, be it Vedanta or Samkhya or Jainism or Buddhism
 upanishdon ko swayan bhi veydant kaha gaya he
 Many philosophers of the world consider the Upanishads to be the best enlightenment
 upanishad bhartiya sabhyataa kii vishwa ko amuly dharohar he
 The main Upanishads are 12 or 13
 harek kisi na kisi veda se judaa hua he
 These are written in Sanskrit
 17ve sadi main daara shikoh ne anek upanishdon kaa farsi main anuwaad karaayaa
 In the 19th century, the German philosophers Schopenhauer and Maxmüller, who showed interest in these texts and translated them, are well known and respected
 upanishad shabd kaa saadhaaran arth he - ‘sameep upaveshan’ yaa 'sameep baithna 
 This word is derived from the prefix 'up', 'ni' and, 'sad' metal
 sad dhaatu ke teen arth hai: vivaran-naash hona; gati-paanaa yaa jaananaa tathaa avsaadan-shithil hona
 In the Upanishads there is a very beautiful and esoteric dialogue between the sage and the disciple that leads the reader to the heart of the Veda
 upanishad bhartiya aadhyatmik chintan ke muladhar he, bhartiya aadhyatmik darshan strot hai
 They are theology
 jigyaasaaon ke rishiyon dwaara khoje hue uttar hai
 They are the essence of the discourses of contemplative sages
 ve kavi-hriday rishiyon kii kavyamay aadhyatmik rachanaayen hai, agyaat kii khoj ke prayaas hai, varnanaatit paramashkti ko shabdon main baandhane kii koshishen hai or us niraakaar, nirvikaar, aseem, apaar ko antardrushti se samajhane or paribhaashit karne kii adamya aakanksha ke lekhabaddh vivaran hai
 The Vedic era was an era of worldly pleasure and consumption
 maanav man kii nishcintata, pavitrataa, bhavukta, bholepan va nishpapata kaa yug tha
 To live life with total carelessness was the love and credit of the people of that period
 prakruti ke vibhinn manohari swaroopon ko dekhakar us samay ke logon ke bhavuk manon main jo udgaar swayansfoort aalokit tarangon ke rup main ubhare un manobhaavon ko unhone prashastiyon, stutiyon, divyagaanon va kavy rachanaaon ke rup main shabdabaddh kiya or ve vaidic richaayen yaa mantra ban gaye
 The minds of those people were filled with worldly joy, were satisfied with prosperity, were overwhelmed by natural divinities
 at: unke geeton main yah kaamana he ki yah anand sadaa bana rahe, badhata rahe or kabhi samaapt na ho
 He wished that we would enjoy this bliss for the entire hundred years and the generations after us should also be satisfied
 yahi nahin kaamana yah bhi kii gai ki is jivan ke samaapt hone par ham swarg main jaaen or is sukh va anand kii nirantarata vahaan bhi bani rahe
 Various rituals were also performed to achieve this purpose and these boons were also sought from them by organizing to please the gods
 jab prakruti karavat leti thi to prakritik vipadaaon kaa saamana hota tha
 Then the rituals to appease and please the imaginary control gods of those plagues, such as Marut, Agni, Rudra, etc
 were performed and they were prayed not to let such plagues come and protect the subjects upon their arrival
 kul milakar vaidic kaal ke logon kaa jivan prafullit, ahladamay, sukhaakankshi, ashaavadi or jijeevishaapurna tha
 There was no shadow of sadness, sin or miserable life in them
 narak va usamen milane vaali yaatnaaon kii kalpana tak nahin kii gai thi
 Karma was considered to be yajna and yajna itself and the concept of attainment of all its pleasures and redress of hazards
 yah jeevanstyli dirghakaal tak chali
 But how long would this go on? ek na ek din to manushya ke anant jigyaasu mastishk main or vartmaan se kabhi santusht na hone vaale man main yah jigyaasa, yah prashn uthanaa hi tha ki prakruti kii is vishaal rangabhumi ke peeche sutaradhar koun he, iskaa sristaa / nirmaataa koun he, iskaa udgam kahan he, ham koun hai, kahan se aae hai, yah sristi antat: kahan jaaegi
 What will happen to us? Shanai: -shanai: These questions sprouted
 or phir shuru hui in sabake uttar khojane kii lalak tathaa jigyaasu man-mastishk kii anant khoj yatra
 It is not that the Vedic sages never thought about soul, rebirth and karmaphalvad
 aisa bhi nahin tha ki is jivan ke bare main unka koi dhyaan na tha
 The sages had also occasionally considered this subject
 iske beej vedon main yatra-tatra milte hai, parantu yah keval vichaar maatr tha
 No worries or fears
 aatma sharir se bhinn tatv he or is jivan kii samaapti ke baad vah paralok ko jaati he is siddhant kaa abhas vaidic richaon main miltaa avashya he parantu sansar main aatma kaa avaagaman kyon hota he, isaki khoj main vaidic rishi pravrutt nahin hue
 Worldly life with all its limitations was the beloved of the Vedic sages
 prey ko chhodkar shrey kii ore badhane kii aturata upanishdon ke samay jaagi, tab moksh ke saamne grahastha jivan nissar ho gaya evam jab log jivan se anand lene ke bajaay usase peeth pherakar sanyas lene lage
 Yes, it also happened that Vedic sages used to calm down by asking 'who created this world?' And 'who is the god whom we worship'? There, the sages of the Upanishads decided some principles regarding the creator and also found out the 'truth' which is the right to worship and worship
 vaidic dharm kaa purana aakhyaan veda or naveen aakhyaan upanishad hai
 'yajna-dharma was performed in the Vedas and people were taught that to be happy, prosperous and successful and victorious in this life, it is necessary to perform sacrifices for the satisfaction and happiness of the gods
 'vishwa kii utpatti kaa sthaan yajna he
 Yajna is the best of all actions
 yajna ke karmfal se swarg kii prapti hoti he
 'these sutras were all around
 duusare, jab brahman granthon ne yajna ko bahut adhik mahatv de diya or purohitwaad tathaa purohiton kii manamaani atyadhik bad gai tab is vyavastha ke viruddh pratikriya hui or virodh kii bhaavana kaa sutarapaat hua
 People started thinking 'what is the real meaning of Yajna?' 'what secret is there within them?' 'what form of religion do they symbolize?' 'will they lead us to the ultimate goal of life?' Thus, too much emphasis on rituals and the tendency of rituals to be presented as the solution to all the problems of life, led the thinking people to rethink about them
 prakruti ke prayek rup main ek niyantrak devtaa kii kalpana karte-karte vaidic arya bahudevvaadi ho gaye the
 Among his deities are Indra, Varuna, Agni, Savita, Som, Ashwini Kumar, Marut, Pushan, Mitra, Pitar, Yama etc
 tab ek bauddhik vyagrata prarambh hui us ek paramashkti ke darshan karne yaa uske vaastavik swaroop ko samajhane kii ki jo sampurna sristi kaa rachayita or in devataaon ke upar kii satta he
 This anxiety paved the way for the Upanishads
 upanishad chintansheel evam kalpashil manishiyon kii darshanik kavy rachanaayen hai
 Where the prose has been written, they are also such words-power, phonetics, love and semantics in the poetry prose that they give an impression of the works of some divine power
 yah sachmuch atyukti nahin he ki unhen 'mantra' yaa 'richa' kaha gaya
 In fact, the Mantra or Richa is related to the Vedas but these nouns are also used here by some scholars to indicate the affinity of the Upanishads
 upanishad apane aasapaas ke drishy sansar ke peeche jhaankane ke praytn hai
 There are no tools available for it and no research and research facilities are possible
 apni manshchetana, maansik anubhuti yaa antardrushti ke aadhaar par hue aadhyatmik sphuran yaa divya prakaash ko hi varnan kaa aadhaar banaaya gaya he
 The Upanishads are diverse chapters of spiritualism written by various inspired sages
 inamen vishwa kii paramsatta ke swaroop, uske avasthaan, vibhinn prakritik shaktiyon ke saath uske sambandh, maanviya aatma main uski ek kiran kii jhalak yaa sookshm pratibimb kii upasthiti aadi ko vibhinn rupakon or pratikon ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 An attempt has been made to present the design through various images and symbols, arising out of deep thinking and self-thinking in relation to the origin of the creation and its creation
 ant main kaha yah gaya ki hamaari shreshth pariklpana ke aadhaar par jo kuch ham samaj sake, vah yah he
 Beyond this, perhaps only the divine knows this secret and 'maybe he does not even know
 ' In short, in the Vedas, efforts were made to understand the nature of the visible and manifest natural powers in this world, to worship them by worshiping them, appeasing them and securing worldly success and prosperity and protection from them
 un tak apni shraddha ko pahunchaane kaa madhyam yagyon ko banaaya gaya tha
 The Upanishads describe the many efforts that were made with the desire to interview the supreme power behind these natural powers or the supreme power of creation
 maanviya kalpana, chintan-kshamta, antardrushti kii kshamta jahaan tak us samay ke darshanikon, manishiyon yaa rishiyon ko pahunchaa sakin unhone pahunchne kaa bharsak praytn kiya
 This was his tenacity
 veda ke chaar bhaag hai - samhita, brahman, aaranyak or upanishad
 The Upanishads depict self and non-self elements which represent the fundamental mysteries of the Vedas
 praaia: upanishad veda ke ant main hi aate hai
 Therefore, they are also known as Vedanta
 vaidic dharm ke moulik siddhanton ko teen pramukh granth pramanit karte hai jo prasthaantrayee ke naam se vikhyath hai, ye hai - upanishad, brahmasutra or shrimadbhagavadgita
 The Upanishads signify Brahmanism
 kehete hai is vidya ke abhyaas se mumukshujan kii avidya nasht ho jaati he ; vah brahm kii prapti kara detii he ; jisase manushyon ke garbhavas aadi sansaarik du:kha sarvatha shithil ho jate hai 
 As a result, the Upanishads are considered to be 'tattva' exponent texts, through practice of which a person is interviewed by Brahma or the Supreme Soul

 Shruti is the supreme text of Veerashaiva religion

 Shaivagam was given to the disciples by the Guru according to the Shravan tradition

 Discussions have been made about their relationship
 shaivagam hi virshaiv dharm ke sarvocch granth hai or agar anya shaiva sahitya or puraano main koi vivaad hota he to shaivagmahi maanya hogi
 Except Shaivagam, all other Veerashaiva scriptures are called departures, because they contain stories that people have memorized and written down from generation to generation
 sabhi prasthaan trya granth shaivagam kii prashansa karte hai
 They have a lower standard from Saivagam, but are easier to read and are read by most Veerashaivas
 pramukh prasthaan trya hai:- aacharyo dwaara rachit shiddhant shikhani, virshaiv puuraan, shivaprakasham, lingapuran or shivlilamrt, shiv gita, vachan sahitya varshabhendra vijay or prabhulinglila, periy puuraan aadi
 This sabhi is in Sanskrit, Kannada, Marathi, Tamil, and Hindu
 bharat desh bada vishaal desh he, lekin uski vishalata or mahanata ko ham tab tak nahin jaan sakate, jabatak ki use dekhen nahin
 This and the way many great men were noticed, but twelve hundred years ago, Jagadguru Renukacharya did a very important work for this

 shaivagam ko shravan parampara ke anusaar guru dwaara shishyon ko diya jaataa tha
 There are four parts in every Saivagam

 Shaivagam is the supreme text of the Veerashaiva religion, and if there is any dispute between other Shaivite literature and poornas, then Shaivagamhi will be valid

 Rama is the seventh incarnation of Vishnu in the ten incarnations of Hinduism
 ram kaa jeevankaal evam parakram maharishi valmiki dwaara rachit sanskrit mahakavy ramayana ke rup main varnit hua he
 Goswami Tulsidas also composed the devotional well-known epic Sri Ramcharitmanas centered on his life
 in donon ke atirikt anya bhartiya bhashaaon main bhi ramayana kii rachanaaen hui hai, jo kaaphi prasiddh bhi hai
 Ram is highly revered and an ideal man, especially in North India
 inhen purushottam shabd se bhi alankrita kiya jaataa he
 Rama was the eldest son of King Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya of Ayodhya
 ram kii patni kaa naam sita tha or inke teen bhai the- lakshmana, bharat or shatrughna
 Hanuman is considered to be the biggest devotee of Lord Rama
 ram ne lanka ke raja ravan kaa vadh kiya
 Rama has a reputation as Maryada Purushottam
 ram ne maryaada ke paalan ke liye rajya, mitra, mata-pita, yahan tak ki patni kaa bhi saath choda
 His family represents the ideal Indian family
 ram raghukul main janme the, jisaki parampara praan jaahun baru bachanu na jaai kii thi
 Sri Ram's father Dasharatha had pledged his step-mother Kaikeyi to fulfill any of his two wishes
 kaikeyi ne daasi manthra ke bahekaave main aakar in varon ke rup main raja dasharath se apane putr bharat ke liye ayodhya kaa rajsinghaasana or ram ke liye chaudaa varsh kaa vanvaas maanga
 Rama happily accepted fourteen years of exile to protect his father's word
 patni sita ne adarsh patni kaa udhaaharan dete hue pati ke saath van janaa uchit samajha
 Bhai Laxman also spent fourteen years in the forest with Rama
 bharat ne nyaay ke liye mata kaa aadesh thukraayaa or bade bhai ram ke paas van jaakar unki charanpaduka le aae
 Then put it on the throne and ruled it
 jab ram vanavaasi the tabhi unki patni sita ko ravan haran kar le gaya
 In the forest, Rama found a friend and devotee like Hanuman who completed all of Rama's work

 Many festivals of Hinduism, such as Dussehra, Ram Navami and Deepawali, are associated with the life story of Rama
 'ram' dhaatu main 'ghan' pratyay ke yoga se 'ram' shabd nishpann hota he
 The meaning of 'rama' metal is related to Raman
 ve pranimaatr ke hriday main 'raman' karte hai, isliye 'ram' hai tathaa bhaktajan unamem 'raman' karte hai, isliye bhi ve 'ram' hai
 In his commentary on 'vishnusahsrnama', Adya Shankaracharya has quoted Padmapuran saying that Yogijans do Ramana in God, so they are 'rama'
 vaidic sahitya main 'ram' kaa ullekh prachlit rup main nahin miltaa he
 The word 'rama' is used only at two places in the Rigveda
 unamem se bhi ek jagah kaale rang ke arth main tathaa shesh ek jagah hi vyakti ke arth main prayog hua he; lekin vahaan bhi unke avtari purush yaa dasharath-putr hone kaa koi sanket nahin he
 Although Neelkanth Chaturdhar has chosen many of the mantras of the Rigveda in his own discretion, he has his own Ramakathapak meaning, but this is his personal belief
 swayan rugveda ke un prakarnon main praapt kisi sanket yaa kisi anya bhashyakaar ke dwaara un mantron kaa ramakthaparak arth siddh nahin ho paaya he
 In the Rigveda, 'ikshvakuh' is used at one place and the word 'dasharatha' is also used at one place
 parantu unke ram se sambaddh hone kaa koi sanket nahin mil paata he
 The word 'rama' is used in Brahmin literature at two sites in Aitareya Brahmana; But there he is called 'ramo Margaveyaah', which according to Acharya Sayan is the son of a woman named 'mrigavu'
 shatapath brahman main ek sthal par 'ram' shabd kaa prayog hua he 
 Here 'rama' is as the Acharya of Yajna and he is called 'rama Aupatapasvini'
 taatpary yah ki prachlit ram kaa avtari rup valmikiy ramayana evam puraanon kii hi dein he
 The following description is available in relation to the birth of Rama in the most authentic scripture Adikavya Valmiki Ramayana related to Ramakatha: xxrep 22 
 chaitre navamike tithu
 
 nakshatreditidaivatye swocchsanstheshu panchasu
 Bhreeshu karkte lagne vakpavatinduna co
 
 That is, in the Navami Tithi of Chaitra month, in Punarvasu Nakshatra, when the five planets are in their high position and the position of Jupiter with the Moon in Cancer Ascendant
 yahan keval brihaspati tathaa chandramaa kii sthiti spasht hoti he
 Jupiter is exalted and the moon is self-possessed
 aage pandrahaven shloke main surya ke ucch hone kaa ullekh he
 In this way, Jupiter and Sun are known to be high
 budh hameshaa surya ke paas hi rahata he
 Therefore, it is impossible for Buddha to be high when the Sun is high
 is prakaar ucch hone ke liye bachate hai shesh teen grah -- mangal, shukr tathaa shani
 For this reason, almost all scholars have considered the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn to be high in the time of Rama's birth
 paramparaagat rup se ram kaa janm treta yug main mana jaataa he
 According to the data available in Hindu theology, especially in mythological literature, a Chaturyugi has 43,20,000 years, of which Kaliyuga has 4,32,000 years and Dwapara 8,64,000 years
 ram kaa janm treta yug main arthath dwapar se pehle hua tha
 Since Kali Yuga has just begun and Rama was born at the end of Treta and the time of his present living on earth with an avatar has traditionally been considered as 11,000 years
 atah dwapar yug ke 8,64,000 varsh + ram kii vartmaanta ke 11,000 varsh + dwapar yug ke ant se abtak beete 5,100 varsh = kul 8,80,100 varsh
 Hence traditionally Rama's birth is considered to be about 8,80,100 years ago
 prakhyat marathi shodhakarta vidwaan dow0 padmakar vishnu vartak ne ek drushti se is samay ko sambhavya mana he
 They say that the height of Vindhyachal and Himalayas at one place in the Valmiki Ramayana is said to be the same
 vindhyachal kii oonchaai 5,000 feet he tathaa yah praayah sthir he, jabaki himalay kii oonchaai vartmaan main 29,029 feet he tathaa yah nirantar vardhansheel he
 The height difference between the two is 24,029 feet
 visheshgyon kii manyata ke anusaar himalay 100 varsho main 3 feet badhata he
 Therefore, it would have taken the Himalayas about 8,01,000 years to grow 24,029 feet
 atah abhi se kareeb 8,01,000 varsh pehle himalay kii oonchaai vindhyachal ke samaan rahi hogi, jiskaa ullekh valmikiy ramayana main vartmaankalik rup main hua he
 In this way Dr
 Vartak finds this time possible from a point of view, but he himself believes that he cannot confirm this time from any other source
 apane suvikhyath granth 'vastav ramayana' main dow0 vartak ne mukhyatah grahagatiyon ke aadhaar par ganit karke valmikiy ramayana main ullikhit grahasthiti ke anusaar ram kii vaastavik janm-tithi 4 disambar 7323 isapurv ko sunishchit kiya he
 According to him, Rama must have been born on this date between 1:30 to 3:00 pm
 dow0 pi0 ve0 vartak ke shodh ke anek varshon ke baad 'ai-sarv' ke ek shodh dal ne 'planetarium gold' software kaa prayog karke shri ram kaa janm 10 janvari 5114 isapurv main siddh kiya
 He believed that the planets had the same position on this date as described in the Valmiki Ramayana
 parantu yah samay kaaphi sandehaaspad ho gaya he
 The 'planetarium Gold' software used by the research team of 'i-serve' is not really capable of doing true planetary mathematics before 3000 BC
 vastutah 2013 isvi se pehle itane pehle kaa grah-ganit karne hetu sakasham software uplabdh hi nahin tha
 Saturn was in Scorpio in the planetary position attained by this calculation, ie it was not in high
 chandramaa punarvasu nakshatra main na hokar pushya ke dwitiya charan main hi tha tathaa tithi bhi ashtami hi thi
 Later in the correct calculation done by ejplde431 software by another expert, the date becomes Navami but Saturn comes in Scorpio and in the fourth phase of Moon Pushya
 atah 10 janvari 5114 isapurv kii tithi vastutah shriram kii janm-tithi siddh nahin ho paati he
 In such a situation, if the date already refined by Dr
 p
v
vartak is certified by the software, then only the real time of Shri Ram will be able to be universally accepted or in case of not being certified, the path of research of new date will be opened
 puraanon main shri ram ke janm ke bare main spasht pramaan milte ki shri ram kaa janm vartmaan uttar pradesh ke faijabad jile ke ayodhya naamak nagar main hua tha

 For this reason, he is known as Maryada Purushottam Rama

 So whenever there is talk of Suraj in India, the example of Ramraj or Ramrajya is given

 The Videha king Janak organized a swayamvar ceremony for the marriage of his daughter Sita
 jahaan bhagwaan shiv kaa ek dhanush tha jisaki pratyancha chadhaane vaale shoorveer se sita kaa vivaah kiya janaa tha
 Many kings Maharaja attended that ceremony

 Hence, he thought of handing over the kingdom to Rama

 At that time Rama's other two brothers Bharata and Shatrughna had gone to their maternal aunt Kaikeya

 If you are the beloved queen of the king then your child should become the king, but King Dasharatha wants Ram to be the king
 ram ke bachapan kii vistaar-purvak vivaran swami tulsidas kii ramcharitamanas ke balkand se milti he
 King Dasharatha had three queens: Kaushalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi
 ram kaushalya ke putr the, sumitra ke do putr, lakshmana or shatrughna the or kaikeyi ke putr bharat the
 With the state rules, only the eldest son of a king is eligible to become a king, so Rama was sure to become the king of Ayodhya
 kaikeyi jinhone do baar dasharath kii jaan bachaai thi or dasharath ne unhen yah var diya tha ki wo jivan ke kisi bhi pal unase do var maang sakati he
 Kaikeyi wanted Rama to be king as Raja becoming king and looking to the future, so he granted Rama 14 years of exile by King Dasharatha and demanded the kingdom of Ayodhya for his son Bharata

 At the time of exile, Ravana killed Sita
 ravan ek rakshas tathaa lanka kaa raja tha
 According to the Ramayana, Sita got distraught after hearing the voice of a deer when Rama, Sita and Lakshmana were in the hut
 vah hiran ravan kaa mamaa marich tha
 He made a golden deer form at the behest of Ravana
 sita use dekh kar mohit ho gai or shriram se us hiran kaa shikaar karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Shri Ram started to fulfill his Indian desire and asked Lakshmana to protect Sita
 Maricha takes Sri Ram too far
 mauka milte hi shriram ne tir chalaaya or hiran bane marich kaa vadh kiya
 While dying, Marich shouted "O Sita! o Laxman!" Made a sound of Sita got worried after hearing that voice and she asked Lakshmana to go to Shri Ram
 Laxman did not want to go, but could not deny his sister-in-law
 lakshmana ne jane se pehle ek rekha khinchi, jo lakshmana rekha ke naam se prasiddh he
 Rama, along with his brother Lakshmana, wandered in search of Sita
 tab ve hanuman or sugriv naamak do vaanron se mili
 Hanuman became the biggest devotee of Rama
 sita ko ko punah praapt karne ke liye bhagwan ram ne hanuman, vibhishana or vanar sena kii madad se raawan ke sabhi bandhu-baandhvon or uske vanshajon ko parajeet kiya tathaa lautate samay vibhishana ko lanka kaa raja banaakar achche shaasha ke liye maargdarshan kiya
