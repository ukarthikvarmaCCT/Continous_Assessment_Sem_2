 Rajendra Prasad has written about his ancestors at the beginning of his autobiography- sanyukt praant main koi jagah amodha naam kii he
 We hear that there is a good settlement of Kayasthas
 bahut din beete vahaan se ek parivaar nikalakar purab chalaa or baliya main jaakar basaa
 After living in Ballia for a long time, a branch of that family went north and started living in Jiradei village of Saran district today
 duusari shakha gaya main jaakar bas gai
 Some people of Jiradei branch also moved to another village a short distance away

 Perhaps my ancestors coming to Jiradei were above me in the seventh or eighth generation

 In fact, there is a long history of thinking related to management
 prabandh ke siddhanton kaa vikaas hua he evam abhi bhi yah prakriya jari he
 While exploring the history of management, many are familiar with the ideologies which have outlined the principles to give direction to managerial behavior
 in vichaardhaaraon ko chah alag-alag charnon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he- The first management ideas were recorded in 3,000-4,000 BC
 misr ke shaasha kyopas ko 2,900 i- pus- main ek pyramid ke nirmaan ke liye 1 lakh aadamiyon kii 20 varsh tak kaary karne kii aavashyaktaa hui
 It was built on 13 acres of land and had a height of 481 meters

 According to Kivandati, even the hammer sound was not heard in the villages around these pyramids
 aise yaadgaar kaary ko bina safal prabandhak siddhanton kaa anusaran kiye puraa karnaa sambhav nahin tha
 This phase is characterized by rational economic thought, scientific management, administrative theory, bureaucratic organization
 vivekshil aarthik vichaar kii dharna thi ki log multah aarthik laabhon se protsaahit hote hai
 Scientific management of lw-taylor and others emphasizes on a best way for production etc
 henry feyol ke samaan vyaktitv vaale prashasnic siddhanthavettaon ne pad evam vyaktiyon ko ek sakasham sanghathan main parivartit karne ke liye sarvottam maarg dhunda
 Theorists of bureaucratic organization, leading Max Weber, discovered a way to eliminate managerial irregularities due to the misuse of rights, leading to the end of effectiveness
 yah audyogic kranti evam utpaadan kii kaarkaana pranali kaa yug tha
 Mass production would not have been possible without following the principles governing organized production
 yah siddhant shram vibhaajan evam vishishtikaran, maanav evam mashin ke bich parsparik sambandh, logon kaa prabandhan aadi par aadhaarit the
 This idea developed between 1920 and 1950
 iskaa maananaa tha ki karmchaaree maatr niyam, adhikaar shrunkhlaa evam aarthik pralobhan ke kaaran hi vivek se kaary nahin karte balki vah saamaajik aavashyaktaaon preranaon evam drushtikon se bhi nirdeshit hote hai
 'harthen' study was done on GECC etc
 yah swabhaavik tha ki audyogic kranti ke praarambhik daur main takanic evam praudyogiki par adhik jor tha
 Focusing on the human element was a distinct aspect of this ideology
 is par dhyaan dena vyaavhaarik vigyaan ke vikaas ke agradoot ke rup main kaary karnaa tha
 Organizational practitioners such as Chris Argeris, Douglas mcgregor, Abraham Maslow, and laderick-herzberg used the knowledge of psychology, sociology, and anthropology to develop this path
 sanghathanaatmak maanavtawaad kaa darshan he jisamen vyaktiyon ko kaary sthal par evam ghar par apni sabhi yogyataon evam rachanaatmak kaushal kaa upyog karnaa hota he
 It emphasizes operation and research using quantum technology to help managers make decisions

 It is clear that the development of the management subject has been very fascinating
 fadrik vincelo tailor evam henry feyol do aitihaasik vyavsaay ke siddhanton se jude rahe hai
 Both of them have contributed heavily in the study of management as a scripture
 el- dablyoo- tailor ek american yantriki ejeeniyar rahaa he jabaki henry feyol ek francisi khadaan ejeeniyar
 While Taylor gave the concept of scientific management, Fayol emphasized administrative principles
 prabandh kaa siddhant nirnay lene evam vyavhaar ke liye vyapak evam saamaanya maardarshak hota he
 For example, assuming a decision is made regarding the promotion of an employee, one manager wants to keep in mind the preference and the other wants to follow the principle of merit
 prabandh ke siddhanton ko khalis vigyaan se bhinn mana ja saktaa he
 The principles of management are not the same as theories of pure science
 kyonki inkaa sambandh maanviya vyavhaar se he isliye inako paristhiti kii maang ke anusaar upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 Human behavior and technology influencing business are never constant
 yah sadaa badalte rahete hai
 For example, in the absence of information and communication technology, a manager can supervise a small workforce spread over a narrow area
 soochna evam sampreshan takanic ke aagaman ne prabandhakon kii puure vishwa main faile vishaal vyavsaayik samrajya ke prabandhan kii yogyata ko badhaayaa he
 Infosys head office in Bangalore can be proud that its seminar room has the largest screen in Asia where its managers can communicate with their employees and customers in any part of the world
 prabandh ke siddhanton kii samaj ko viksit karne ke liye yah jaananaa bhi upyogi rahegaa ki yah siddhant nayaa nahin he
 The principles of management and techniques of management vary
 takanic abhipraay prakriya evam paddatiyon se he
 These are a series of steps to achieve the desired objectives
 siddhant takneekon kaa prayog karne main nirnay lene athwa kaary karne main maargdarshan kaa kaary karte hai
 In the same way, theories should be considered different from values
 mulyon se abhipraay kisi cheez ko sweekaar karne athwa uski ichha rakhane se he
 Values are ethical
 siddhant vyavhaar ke aadharbhoot satya athwa maardarshak hote hai
 Values there are general rules for the behavior of people in a society which are formed by equal behavior while the principles of management are formed by research in working conditions and are of technical nature
 prabandh ke siddhanton ko vyavhaar main laate samay mulyon kii avhelnaa nahin kar sakate kyonki vyavsaay ko samaaj ke prati saamaajik evam naitik uttardayitvon ko nibhaana hota he
 Prakriti means the qualities and characteristics of anything
 siddhant saamaanya aupchaarik kathan hote hai jo kuch paristhitiyon main hi lagu hote hai inkaa vikaas prabandhakon ke avlokan, pareekshan evam vyaktigat anubhav se hota he prabandh ko vigyaan evam kala donon ke rup main viksit karne main unka yogadan is par nirbhar karata he ki unhen kis prakaar se praapt kiya jaataa he tathaa vah prabandhkeey vyavhaar ko kitne prabhavi dhang se samajha sakate hai evam uskaa purvanumaan laga sakate hai
 Developing these principles is science, then their use can be considered as art
 yah siddhant prabandh ko vyavhaarik paksh ke adhyayan evam shaikshanik yogyata ko vishwasaneeyata pradaan karte hai
 Reaching higher positions of management is not due to birth but because of the necessary qualifications
 spasht he ki prabandh peshey ke rup main vikaas ke saath prabandh ke siddhanton ke mahatva main vruddhi hui he
 Principles serve as guidance for action
 yah kaaran evam parinaam main sambandh ko spasht karte hai
 While managing, the functions of management are planning, organization, appointment, direction and control management
 jabaki siddhant in kaaryon ko karte samay prabandhakon ko nirnay lene main sahaayak hote hai
 The following points summarize the nature of the principles of management
 prabandh ke siddhant sabhi prakaar ke sanghathanon main prayukt kiye ja sakate hai
 These organizations can be of professional and non-commercial, small and big, public and private, manufacturing and service sectors
 lekin vah kis seemaa tak prayukt ho sakate hai yah sanghathan kii prakruti, vyavsaayik kaaryon, parichaalan ke paimaane aadi baton par nirbhar karegaa
 For example, for higher productivity, the work should be divided into smaller parts and each employee must be trained for efficiency in their work
 yah siddhant sarkari karyaalayon main vishesh rup se prayukt ho saktaa he jahaan dak athwa villekhon ko praapt karne evam bhejne ke liye daiyanandini preshan rclak, computer main aankadon ko darj karne ke liye aankade pravesh parichaalak, chaparasi, adhikari aadi hote hai
 These principles are also used in limited liability companies, for example production, finance, marketing and R&D
 kaary vibhaajan kii seemaa paristhiti anusaar bhinn ho sakati he
 General guidance principles serve as guidance for the task but these are not ready, hundred percent solutions to all managerial problems
 iskaa kaaran he vaastavik paristhitiyaan badi jatil evam gatisheel hoti hai tathaa yah kai tatwon kaa parinaam hoti hai
 But the importance of principles cannot be underestimated because even the smallest guidelines can be helpful in solving a problem
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi do vibhaagon main koi virodhabhas kii sthiti paidaa hoti he, to isse nipatane ke liye prabandhak sanghathan ke vyapak uddeshyon ko praathamikta de sakate hai
 The principles of management are created only by the experience and intelligence tact and research of all managers
 udhaaharan ke liye sabhi kaa anubhav he ki kisi bhi uddeshy kii prapti ke liye anushaasan anivaary he
 This principle is a part of the principles of management
 duusari ore kaarkaane main kamgaaron kii thakaan kii samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye baari dawaab ko kam karne ke liye bhautik paristhitiyon main sudhaar ke prabhaav kii jaanch hetu pareekshan kiya ja saktaa he
 Principles of elasticity are not inelastic prescriptions that must be followed
 ye lacheele hote hai tathaa paristhiti kii maang ke anusaar prabandhak in main sudhaar kar sakate hai
 Managers have enough leeway to do this, for example, the possession of all rights with one person or their distribution to different people will depend on the situation and circumstances of each enterprise
 vaise prayek siddhant ve hathiyaar hote hai jo alag-alag uddeshyon ko puraa karne ke liye alag-alag hote he tathaa prabandhak ko nirnay lenaa hota he ki kis paristhiti main vah kis siddhant kaa prayog kare
 The principles of management aim to influence human behavior
 isliye prabandh ke siddhant mukhyatah vyaavhaarik prakruti ke hote hai
 This does not mean that these principles are not related to object state and event
 antar keval yah hota he ki kisko kitna mahatva diya ja rahaa he
 The principles help in understanding the mutual relationship between human and material resources to achieve the objectives of the organization
 udhaaharan ke liye kaarkaane kii yojana banaate samay yah dhyaan main rakhaa jayega ki vyavastha ke liye kaary pravaah kaa maal ke pravaah evam maanviya gatividhiyon se milan hona chahie
 The principles of management establish the relationship between cause and consequence so that they can be used in a large number of similar situations
 yah hamen bataate hai ki yadi kisi ek siddhant ko ek paristhiti vishesh main upyog kiya gaya he, to iske kya parinaam ho sakate hai
 The principles of management are less certain because they are mainly used in human behavior
 vaastavik jivan main paristhitiyaan sadaa ek samaan nahin rahati hai
 Therefore, it is difficult to establish the right relationship between the cause and the result
 phir bhi prabandh ke siddhant kuch seemaa tak in sambandhon ko sthapit karne main prabandhakon kii sahaayta karte hai, isiilie ye upyogi hote hai
 In an emergency, it is expected that one responsibility and the other should follow it
 lekin yadi vibhinn prakaar kii parichalanaatmak vishistataa kii paristhiti he jaise koi nayaa kaarkaana lagaana he to nirnay lene main adhik sahyog praapt karnaa uchit rahegaa
 The application of management principles is uncertain or depends on the current circumstances of a particular time
 aavashyaktaanusaar siddhanton ke prayog main parivartan laayaa ja saktaa he
 For example, employees should get fair remuneration, but what is fair will be determined by many elements
 inamen sammilit hai, karmchaariyon kaa yogadan, niyokta kii bhugtan kshamta tathaa jis vyavsaay kaa ham adhyayan kar rahe hai, usamen prachlit mazdooree dar
 After describing the qualities and characteristics contained in the principles of management, it will be easy for you to understand the importance of these principles in making managerial decisions
 lekin isse pehle aap saath main die gaye box main bharat ke ek atyadhik safal vyavsaayee evam biophone ke pramukh kaaryakari adhikari kiran majumdaar shaw ke ‘vastusthiti adhyayan’ ko pard sakate hai
 You will see how the biotechnology field, which very few people knew, was converted into a highly profitable company and earned the name that could be the dream of any person
 prabandh ke siddhanton kaa mahatva unki upyogita ke kaaran he
 It provides useful micro-knowledge of the behavior of management and affects managerial behavior
 prabandhak in siddhanton ko apane daayitv evam uttardayitvon ko puraa karne ke liye upyog main laa sakate hai
 You would believe that every material thing is governed by the underlying principle
 prabandh ke siddhantkaar kaa praytn sadaa nihit siddhanton kii khoj karnaa rahaa he tathaa rahanaa bhi chahie jisase ki inhen doharaai ja rahi paristhitiyon main swabhaavik rup se prabandh ke liye upyog main laayaa ja sake
 The importance of the principles of management can be explained as: prabandh ke siddhant, prabandhakon ko vaastavik duniyavi sthiti main upyogi panth karaate hai
 Adopting these principles will increase knowledge, competence and understanding regarding their managerial position and circumstances
 isse prabandhak apni pichhali bhuulon se kuch sikhega tathaa baar-baar utpann hone vaali samasyaon ko teji se hal kar samay kii bachat karegaa
 Thus the principles of management increase the management capacity
 For example, a manager can leave day-to-day decisions to the subordinates and will himself do specific tasks which will require his own expertise
 iske liye vah adhikaar antaran ke siddhant kaa paalan karegaa
 Both human and physical resources available to the company are limited
 inkaa adhiktam upyog karnaa hota he
 Their maximum use means that the resources are used in such a way that they can get maximum benefit at the least cost
 siddhanton kii sahaayta se prabandhak apane nirnyon evam kaaryon main kaaran evam parinaam ke sambandh kaa purvanumaan laga sakate hai
 This can help prevent mistakes in the policy of taking education
 prabhavi prashasan ke liye prabandhkeey vyavhaar kaa vyaktikaran aavashyak he jisase ki prabandhkeey adhikaron kaa suvidhanusaar upyog kiya ja sake
 The principles of management determine the extent of arbitrariness in management so that the decisions of the managers are free from personal preferences and favoritism
 udhaaharan ke liye, vibhinn vibhaagon ke liye vaarshik bajet ke nirdhaaran main prabandhakon dwaara nirnay unki vyaktigat pansad par nirbhar karne ke sthaan par sanghathan ke uddeshyon ke prati yogadan ke siddhant par aadhaarit hote hai
 Decisions should be based on the facts considered and justified as the stated objectives
 yah samyaanukool, vaastavik evam maapan tathaa moolyankan ke yogya hone chahien
 Management principles should be helpful in making thoughtful decisions
 haan tark par jor dete hai na ki aankh mundakar vishwaas karne par
 The decisions of management, which are taken on the basis of principles, are free from personal hostility and partiality
 yah paristhiti ke tarksangat moolyankan par aadhaarit hote hai

 He is mentioned in many Puranas

 ise desimetre pattee yaa tarang bhi kehete hai kyonki inaki tarang das se ek desimetre kii hoti he

 bharat ke naanaa dharmon main aagam kaa samrajya he
 Jainism has adequate inclusion of Agamapuja even when it is low in quantity
 buddha dharm kaa 'vajrayan' isi paddati kaa prayojak maarg he
 Due to the variation of the deity worshiped in Vedic religion, it has three types: Vaishnava Agam, Shaiva Agam and Shakta Agam
 aagam parampara se aaye hindu dharm ke mahatvapurn granth hai
 These are the complements of the Vedas
 inke vaktaa praayah shivaji hote hai
 This scripture is commonly known as 'tantrashastra'
 nigamagamamoolak bhartiya samskruti kaa aadhaar jis prakaar nigam he, usee prakaar aagam bhi he
 Both are nutritious to each other despite being independent
 nigam karm, gyaan tathaa upasna kaa swaroop batalaata he tathaa aagam inke upaybhoot sadhano kaa varnan karata he
 That is why Vachaspati Mishra has derived the derivation of ‘agam’ in ‘tattvavashardi’ as follows: Agachanti Budhimaoharanti Abhyudayani: Shreyasopaya Yasmatt, Sa Agam:
 aagam kaa mukhya lakshya 'kriya' ke upar he, tathaapi gyaan kaa bhi vivaran yahan kam nahin he
 According to 'varahitantra' the Agama is confluent with these seven traits: Srishti, Pralaya, Devartharna, Sarvashakta, Purana, Shatkarma, Means and Meditation
 'mahanirvana' tantra ke anusaar kaliyug main praani medhya tathaa amedhya ke vichaaron se bahudhaa hin hote hai or inhen ke kalyanarth mahadev ne aagmon kaa upadesh parvati ko swayan diya
 That is why the worship of Agama is considered to be particularly useful and beneficial in Kali Yuga - Kalau Agamasamati:
 vaidic dharm main upasya devtaa kii bhinnata ke kaaran iske teen prakaar he: vaishnav aagam, shaiva aagam tathaa shakt aagam
 Three distinctions are also considered in terms of dvaita, dvaitaadvaita and advaita
 anek aagam vedamulak hai, parantu katipay tantron ke upar bahari prabhaav bhi lakshith hota he
 Especially the influence of China or Tibet on Shakhagam's ethics has been acknowledged in the Puranas
 aagmik puja vishuddh tathaa pavitra bhartiya he
 Ignorance of the mystery of 'panch Makar' is also productive of many illusions about it
 aisa bhi kaha jaataa he ki aagam shaastra kaa gyaan sun kar yaa gurmukh ke dwaara hi paaya ja saktaa he mahadev ke dwaara ye divyagyaan lomash rishi ko praapt hua or phir gurumukh dwaara anya ko The oldest part of Jain literature is called 'agam'
 aagam granth kaaphi pracheen he, tathaa jo sthaan vaidic sahitya kshetra main veda kaa tathaa buddha sahitya main tripitak kaa he, vahi sthaan jain sahitya main aagmon kaa he
 In the Agam texts, there is a compilation of many stories and stories related to the teachings of Mahavira and Jain culture
 ye aagam 46 hai-ang : ayaarang, sooyagdan, thanang, samavayang, bhagwati, nayadhammakaha, uwasgadasa, antgavdasa, anuttarovaviyadasa, panhvagaran, vivagasuy, diththavaay

 Knoll has been considered a competitor to encyclopedic sites such as Wikipedia citizendiam, Scholarpedia, and has been described as a complement to Wikipedia, offering a different format to point towards Wikipedia's many shortcomings

 After the introduction of Knoll's beta, Google's product manager Cedric Dupont reacted to the idea that Google's objective was that Knoll came forward as a "wikipedia killer", stating that "google is therefore very happy That Wikipedia has been so successful

 According to Search Engine Land editor Danny Sullivan, the goal of Google's need to be fair was to simplify the search of Knoll's pages so that search engines don't clash
 "jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy Raised a similar concern: "at the end of the day, there is a fundamental conflict between Google's business and its social concerns

 Ever since its announcement in December 2007, there has been speculation about Google's intentions as an organizer and his status as a creator of content
 Jack Ashkofield of The Guardians argued that "knoll represents an attack on the media industry in general

 Because the class distinguishes the reference plane in two places, the two names are given different names

 And where the object is going down from the surface, it is called descending or south-facing

 The two places where the earth's orbit penetrates the sun path are the equinox of the time of the earth's orbit shells

 worldcat is a union catalog that itemizes the collections of 72,000 libraries in 170 countries and territories which participate in the Online Computer Library Center global cooperative
 It is built and maintained collectively by the participating libraries
 The catalog was created in 1971
 It contains more than 300 million records, representing over 2 billion physical and digital assets in more than 470 languages, as of January 2014
 It is the world's largest bibliographic database
 OCLC makes worldcat itself available free to libraries, but the catalog is the foundation for other fee-based OCLC services
 worldcat was founded by Fred Kilgour in 1967
 In 2003, OCLC began the "open worldcat" pilot program, making abbreviated records from a subset of worldcat available to partner web sites and booksellers, to increase the accessibility of its member libraries' collections
 In 2006, it became possible to search worldcat directly at its website
 In 2007, worldcat Identities began providing pages for 20 million "identities", predominantly authors and persons who are the subjects of published titles
 worldcat operates on a batch processing model rather than a real-time model
 That is, worldcat records are synchronized at intermittent intervals with the underlying library catalogs instead of real-time or every day
 worldcat shows that a particular item is owned by a particular library, but does not provide that library's call number
 It also does not indicate if the item is currently borrowed, lost, undergoing restoration or repair, or moved to storage not directly accessible to patrons
 worldcat also does not show if a library owns multiple copies of a particular title
 As an alternative, worldcat allows participating institutions to add direct links from worldcat to their own catalog entries for a particular item, which enables the user to determine its real-time status
 However, this still requires users to open multiple Web pages, each pointing to a different OPAC with its own distinctive user interface design, until they can locate a catalog entry that shows the item is currently available at a particular library

 This project involves captive training by its human trainers so that tigers can gain from their predatory instincts to breed Bengal tiger cubs
 Once they say that they can sustain themselves in the wild, they will be released, fend for themselves in the forest
 Their instructors, John Varty and Dave Salmoni, have to teach them how to hunt and to chase, the most important thing to associate hunting with food

 Arithmetic has been considered the best science in Sanskrit literature
 lagbhag paanchavin shatabdi main bharat main aryabhatta dwaara ank sangyaaon kaa avishkaar hua tha
 In this way, one, ten, hundred, sahasra etc
 came to be used for measuring numbers
 ganit vishyak vibhinn prashn hal karne ke liye bhartiya vidwaanon ne vargamul, dhanmul or agyaat sankhyaon ko maaloom karne ke dhang nikaale
 The decimal system came into use to express small parts of numbers

 Impressed by the ease of this system, many other countries also adopted it
 belgium ne san 1833 or switzaraland ne san 1891 main is pranali ko apanaaya
 Germany, Holland, Russia and America also had a great impact on this system and these countries also adopted this type of system soon

 In India, there were many different types of measurement and weighing
 prayek praant or mandi main alag alag dhangon se chijen maapi or tauli jaati thim
 It is estimated that there were more than 150 types of weights and different methods of measurement in the country
 in kathinaaiyon se vastuon kaa adanapradaan tathaa unka sahi bhav maaloom karnaa bada kathin ho jaataa tha
 Due to the variation of the measurement weights, there is not even an accurate estimate of the decreasing prices of the items
 isse vyapaar kii bahut kshati haati he or kreta evam vikreta donon ko shankaa rahati he
 The method of bringing uniformity in the methods of measurement of weights was considered many times in India, but only in September, 1956, the Weights and Measures Model Act was passed
 28 disambar 1956 i
 ko usapar raashtrapati kii sweekruti praapt hone par kendriya sarkaar ko dashamik pranali ke baat or maap chalaane kaa adhikaar praapt hua
 By adopting this system, the government got the right to implement the same type of measurement and weighing methods in the whole country
 isse vyapaar or vastuon ke yatayaat main badi sahaayta mili
 The ease of the decimal system also made it easier to calculate and weigh transactions
 is pranali ke anusaar lambaai maapne kii ikai meter he, jo ek gaj se lagbhag teen inch bada hota he
 Similarly, the unit of mass load is kilogram and the unit of scale of liquid material is liter

 Swelling, redness, heat and pain at any place are the main symptoms of dysmenorrhea
 ye sabhi lakshan pradaah main honevaali pratikriya dwaara utpann hote hai
 The sole purpose of inflammation is to rid the body of the stimulant and complete the damage caused by it
 pradaah sharir ke kisi bhi bhaag main ho saktaa he
 Boils, pimples, wounds, pneumonia, swelling, colds, eye soreness, ear flutter, tuberculosis etc
 are all different forms of inflammation
 uttejnaa paidaa karanevaali vastuen sajiv evam nirjeev padaarth, do bhaagon main vibhajit kii ja sakati hai
 There are living organisms, such as microorganisms, parasites, etc
 of the disease and inanimate, physical causes such as heat, cold, electricity, unknown substances, heterogeneous substances, injuries, etc
 and various substances of chemical substances, such as alkalis, acids, etc
, vary from inflammation

 Depending on the amount of the stimulant, the effect of the stimulant on the body and the resistance power of the body

 There are three types of reactions in inflammation: pargilan yaa oothkakshay evam ni:sravan pratikriyaayein ugr pradaah main tathaa oothkakshay or prachurodbhavan dirghakaalik pradaah main pradhanthya hote hai
 In all these reactions, blood and lymph, and various components of connective and sensory tissue participate
 rog ke sookshm jeevanu sharir main pravesh kar shleshmakala par athwa rakt evam lasika kii nalikaaon se hokar, sanyojak or indriya utakon main pradaah kii pratikriya prarambh kar dete hai
 If the germs are in excess, or their toxic strength is high, or the body's resistance is reduced, the inflammation takes a violent form
 ye pratikriyaayein nimnlikhit rup se sampann hoti he: pratham rakt kii sookshm dhamnikaaye kshanik samay ke vaaste sikudti hai
 This causes the flow of blood inside those arteries to intensify, then these arteries widen and the flow of blood slows down inside them
 isse sookshm koshkaon tathaa lasika kii nalikaaon kaa prasar bad jaataa he, jisase pradaah ke upar kii twachaa yaa shleshmakala, laal tathaa garam ho jaati he
 The cells of the wall of these microscopic capillaries increase their number by proliferation and take the shape of amoebae, causing the wall of cells to become rough

 Along with these, red particles of blood also come out at the inflammation

 These white cells converge in the body's environment stimulated by a symbolic expression of a particular substance
 is kriya ko rasayan anuchalan kehete hai
 The fluid in the blood depends on the stimulated power generated by the toxin of the microbes at that inflammatory place, especially on the wall of microscopic cells
 rogaanuon kaa vish oothkakshay milakar sutaramay protein bana lete hai, jo bahukhandee shwet koshikaon ko ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par vividh rakt kan, taral padaarth tathaa oothkakshay sab milakar sujan kaa rup le lete hai
 This swelling pressure in the tissues causes stress on the nerve, which causes pain

 In the beginning of acute inflammation, only the multicellular white cells carry out the bactericidal activity predominantly
 paap utpannkaaree rogaanu in koshikaon ko apni ore adhik maatra main aakarshith karte hai, isaliye is prakaar ke pradaahon main bahukhandee koshikaaye hi adhik maatra main aakarshith karte hai, isaliye is prakaar ke pradaahon main bahukhandee koshikaaye hi adhik maatra main milti hai
 The solids and fluids of the blood and various components of tissue protect the body from its shock by lightening the amount of toxin produced by microbes

 Both actions - first, bacteriophage and second, the exit of the plasma by the blood vessels - lead the body to get rid of the damage caused by microbes
 ye sab vividh kriyaayein rasinic padaartho evam tantrikaon ke protsaahan dwaara sampann hoti hai
 If the number of germs and the stimulating power is not high and the body's resistance is abundant, then the multicellular white cells declare victory over these bacteria and swallow them by bactericidal action
 is kriya main kuch bahukhandee koshikaaye bhi dharashayi ho jaati hai
 These streamlined cells produce a type of protein solvent that dissolves dead tissues, etc
, and takes away the fluid from the inflammation and the white cells and germs from the lymph nodes by the lymph nodes
 yadi rogaanu apane vish dwaara vijayi hote hai, to pradaah sthaan main bahukhandee koshikaaye bahut adhik maatra main dharashayi ho jaati hai or ve pip kaa rup le leti hai
 The inflammation changes from red to yellow
 isi ko pakaa phoda kehete hai
 When the boils are treated by drugs, the germs are destroyed and at the end of the inflammation at that place, the blood and the monolithic cells of the tissues collect, and destroy the germs by swallowing them at a rapid speed
 saath hi saath ye akhandee koshikaaye un dharashayi bahukhandee koshikaon ko bhi nigal jaati hai jo rogaanuon dwaara maar daali gai hai or is prakaar pradaah ke sthaan ke swasth avasthaa main laane kaa praytn nirantar kriyasheel rahata he
 Tissue cells increase their number by proliferation, creating new ones with the help of connective tissue at the location and the place becomes healthy again

 The effect of the stimulating power produced by these microbes takes the form of long lasting inflammation on the body
 is pravaah main ni:sravan kriya bahut kam maatra main hoti he, isaliye isamen bahukhandee koshikaaye bhi vishesh bhaag nahin letin
 In place of them, lymphocytes, plasma cells and non-permanent cells of tissues increase in number by proliferation and collect at the inflammation site

 This is called wound

 Here, mainly the connective tissue participates in wound healing, so the soft and shiny space becomes hard and tissuey after being well after prolonged inflammation

 St
 Kitts and Nevis is theoretically a monarchy, and its ruler of St
 Kitts and Nevis is its head of state, although the ruler-general of St
 Kitts and Nevis, as his representative, exercises all the constitutional powers of the ruler
 
 adhirat yadi stri ho to unhen " saint kits or nevis kii rani" ke naam he sambodhit kiya jaataa he, or ek purush adhirat ko " saint kits or nevis ke raja ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 The historical background of the monarchy in St
 Kitts and Nevis dates back to British colonialism, when Britain expanded its empire in the 18th century and established colonies in various corners of the world
 dhire-dhire in upniveshon ko apni prashasan par samprabhutaa pradaan kar di gai, or westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara in saare rajyon ko rashtramandal ke andar, purnatah samaan pad de diya gaya tha

 in anek rashtron ke chinhatmak samanaantar pramukh hone ke naate, british ekarat swayan ko rashtramandal ke pramukh ke kitaab se bhi nawazte hai
 Although the ruler is usually referred to as the British ruler, in principle, all nations have equal authority over the sovereign, and all countries of the Commonwealth are completely independent and autonomous
 samprabhu ke parivaar ke sabase kareebi sadasyon ke samooh ko kahajata he
 However, there is no firm rule or legislation that regulates which individuals should be placed in this particular group, nor is there any legislation that defines the royalty in detail
 aam taur par britain ke un vyaktiyon ko jinpar hiz / har magesti yaa hiz / har royal hyness kaa sambodhan rakhte hai, ko aam taur par rajpariwaar kaa sadsy mana jaataa he
 Only the sovereign has constitutional duties and positions in the royal family

 But because the British are also the heads of the Church of England, the legislation prohibiting Catholic persons from inheriting throne has been kept in place
 is vidheyak ko 23 april 2013 ko shahi sweekruti mili, tathaa saare rashtramandal pradeshon main sambandhit vithan paarit hone ke pashchaat march 2015 ko yah lagu hua
 No successor of Singhasana can voluntarily renounce his succession

 However, the government bears the charge of the expenses incurred during the visit of the sovereign or royal family
 iske alaava, governor-governor-general ke aadhikarik kharche bhi sarkaar uthaati he
 The ruling queen / king is theoretically vested with the authority of a constitutional ruler, but conventionally all these powers are bound to be exercised only by the Maharajyapala, being the representative of the ruler as per the specifications of Parliament and Government
 atah anya rashtramandal prajabhumiyon ke samaan hi, yah ek sansadeey samrajyata he
 As a parliamentary ruler, all constitutional rights of the ruler are limited to fair and non-political functions, which are in principle the rights of the ruler, but in reality they are exercised only by the governor-general
 jabaki rajnatik-shaktiyon kaa abhyay governor-general dwaara sarkaar or apane mantriyon kii salaah or vinirdeshon par hi karte hai
