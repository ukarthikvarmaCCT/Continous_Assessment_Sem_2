 In the British political concept, the sovereign of Britain is regarded as the human incarnation of the Rajmukut, that is, they are the ultimate source of total authority of the entire state and the whole system, and the British sovereign ultimately has the right to rule over Britain
 atah, nyaayadhish, saansadon tathaa tamaam mantriyon samet, saare sarkari afasaron or karmchaariyon ek aadhikarik niyokta va karyaadhikaar ke ke pradaata bhi samprabhu hi hai

 However, in governing, policy making and administrative decision making, the substantive contribution of the court is minimal and nominal, as the various historical constitutions and conventions make most of the supremacist powers of the ruler from the crown to ministers and officials or other institutions of the crown
 Passes have been delegated
 atah shaskaon dwaara rajmukut ke naam par kiye gaye adhiktar kaary, chaahe shaasha dwaara swayan hi kiye gaye kaary ho, jaise kii maharani kaa abhibhaashan yaa sansad kaa rajkeey udghaatan, saare kaaryo ke nirnay kahin or liye jate hai: The legislative work is done by the Queen Sansad, by the advice and approval of the Parliament, the House of Lords and the House of Commons, while the executive powers are exercised in the name of the Queen by her Majesty's Government

 And the power of the ruler to judge and punish is vested in the judiciary, which is, constitutionally, independent of the government
 vahin carch of england, jisaki pramukh rani he, kii apni swayan kii prashasnic vyavastha he
 Apart from this, other functions of the ruler have also been assigned to various committees and bodies
 jab aavashyak ho, tab, adhirat kaa daayitv he kii ve apni sarkaar kaa netritv karne ke liye ek pradhanmantri kii niyukti karen
 According to the historical tradition of the unwritten constitution, the Prime Minister usually has a net of a majority party in the House of Commons

 In the case of a hung assembly, there is more opportunity to elect the representative of the government at will, using their discretion beyond the superannuation, although in such a situation the leader of the largest party of the House is elected accordingly

 paaramparik taur par, sansad ke satr ko bulaane va bhang karne kaa adhikaar shaasha ke vivek par tha, or shaasha swechha se sabha bulaayaa va bhang kiya karte the
 Therefore, even today, rulers exercise the right to summon and dissolve the Parliament
 2011 main paarit phixd-turm paraliyaments act ne sansad bhang karne ke ashikaar ko khatm kar diya
 However, the ruler still has the right to perform the suntan
 yadi ek alpsankhyak sarkaar, sansad ko bhang kar nae chunaav ghoshit karne kii maang karti he, to shaasha aisi maang ko kaarij karne ke liye purnatah swatantra hai
 Ideally, the ruler can voluntarily demote the prime minister at any time, but in the current state the prime minister is expelled from office only in the event of death, or electoral defeat

 Although in these nations also they have almost the same rank and authority as in Britain, but in those countries, they have no real political or traditional duties, almost all the duties of the ruler as their representative fulfills the General Manager of that country
 
 britain kii sarkaar kaa rashtramandal pradeshon kii sarkaron ke kaary main koi bhi bhoomika yaa hastkshep nahin he
 Commonwealth dimensions other than Britain: Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica, Canada, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, St

 purvatah rashtron ke rashtramandal ke saare desh rashtramandal paribhumi ke hissaa hua karte the, parantu 1950 main bharat ne swatantraaa ke pashchaat swayan ko ganraajya ghoshit kiya, or british rajasatta kii rashtrapramukh ke rup main samprabhutaa ko bhi khatm kar diya
 But India retained the membership of the Commonwealth
 uske baad se, rashtramandal deshon main, british samprabhu ko "rashtramandal ke pramukh" kaa pad bhi diya jaataa he, jo rashtramandal ke sanghathan kaa nammaatr pramukh kaa pad he
 This post has no political meaning
 rashtramandal pradeshon ke bich kaa sambandh is prakaar kaa he kii uttaradhikaar ko anushaasit karne vaale kisi bhi bidhan kaa saare deshon kii ekamat sweekruti aavashyak he
 Succession over the throne is disciplined by various historical constitutions, including the Bill of Rights, 1689, the Act of Settlement, 1701 and the Act of Union, 1707

 After sitting on the throne, a person rules till his death

 act of setlement, 1701, uttaradhikaar ko sofia of hanover, james pratham kii ek potee, ke vaidhik protestant vanshajon tak simit karata he
 Therefore, no Catholic member of the royal family can ever authorize the throne
 ek shaasi shaasha ke nidhan par swayamev hi, rajpth, uske asann vaaris ke paas chalaa jaataa he, atah saidhantik rup se, singhasana ek kshan ke liye bhi khali nahin rahata he
 And the succession is publicly declared by the succession council
 atah angreji parampara ke anusaar shaasha ke uttaradhikaar ko vaid hone ke liye rajbhishek hona aavashyak nahin he
 So the coronation is usually a few months after the succession
 nae shaasha ke rajbhishek kii parampara westminster aibe main cantarbari ke archbishap dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Historically, succession has been disciplined by the doctrine of male-dominant consanguineous primacy, in which sons have been given priority over eldest daughters, and eldest offspring of the same sex are given first priority
 atah uttaradhikari ke ling tathaa dharm kaa uttaradhikaar par mahatvapurn prabhaav padataa he
 At a Commonwealth meeting in 2011, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that all Commonwealth territories had agreed to end the male preference tradition, and also to revoke future rulers from prohibiting Catholics from marrying Catholic individuals
 Everyone's approval was obtained
 parantu kyonki british adhirat carch of england ke pramukh bhi hote hai, atah catholic vyaktiyon ko singhasana uttaradhikrut karne par roak lagane vaale vidhaan ko yathaast rakhaa gaya he
 The bill received royal assent on 23 April 2013, and came into force on March 2015 after the passage of the relevant legislation in all Commonwealth territories

 Spouses of Sovereigns, Disabilities: At least three of the following persons must be confirmed Lord Chancellor, Speaker of the House of Commons, Lord High Advocate, and Protector of the Scrolls
 regency ko puraa karne ke liye, yah bhi ek hi teen vyaktiyon kii ek ghoshnaa kii aavashyaktaa he
 The Regency, when necessary, becomes the Regent following the proper line of succession; Parliamentary voting or some other treatment is needed
 regent, british naagarikta he, or britain kaa nivasee hona
 According to these rules, the only regent was the future George IV, who reigned when his father George III went mad
 haalanki, 1953 main regency ke adhinium kahata he ki agar rani ke uttaradhikari regency kii jarurat he, rajkumaar philip, edinburgh ke duk regent he
 If the Regency Queen is required, the Regent will be next in line to the board

 Advisers of state requirements are doing the same as Regents
 vartmaan main, paanch rajyon ke parshadon: Parliament provides funds for most of the sovereign's government spending through parliamentary grants and public funds, known as the "citizen List"
 tathaa ek vaarshik anudaan, shahi nivaason ke rakrakhaav tathaa rani kii aadhikarik yatraaon ke liye bhi aavantit kii jaati he
 Funds for most expenses, including staff costs, state visits, formal commitments, and official entertainment, are met by the civic list itself
 yah raashi sansad dwaara 10 varshon kii avadhi ke liye nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 By the year 1760, the financial requirements of the ruler were met by hereditary revenue, profits of crown assets
 1760 main raja jorge tritiy ne apane vanshanugat rajwan kaa parityag civil list ke liye karne kii sahmati de di, jo varsh 2012 tak rahaa
 At present, the amount of money received from Mukutia Estates is more than that given to the Civil List or other grants to the Adhrat
 is prakaar 2007-08 ke bich crown esteton ne rajkosh main £200 million kii vruddhi karwaai, jabaki sansad dwaara 40 lakh pound kaa bhugtan kiya gaya tha
 Thus, with a wealth of 7
3 billion pounds, crown assets are one of the largest landowners in Britain, these sari assets are placed under trust and the sovereign cannot deal with them voluntarily
 2012 ke baad se sansadeey anudaan or naagarik suchi ko mila kar ek sankukt samprabhu anudaan se badal diya gaya he
 Like the Mukutiyya estate, the land and properties of the Duchy of Lancaster have been placed under the royal trust
 yah sab shahi bhatte kaa hissaa he
 The revenue generated by this duchy is used for the "personal expenses" of the ruler, which are not borne by the citizen list
 isi prakaar cornwall kii dachi ek kshetra he, jise shaasha ke jyeshtha putr ke vishwash main, unke nijee kharchon hetu, aavantit kii gayi he
 The sovereign is eligible for indirect taxes such as value-added tax, and since 1993 also income tax and capital gains tax
 is sandarbh main, naagarik suchi or sansadeey anudaan ko aay nahin mana jaataa he, kyonki unhi aadhikarik kaaryon ke liye diya jaataa he
 Estimates of the queen's total wealth, depending on whether the personal property is being counted or the property held by the ruler in the trust, may vary considerably
 udhaaharan ke liye, shahi sangrah adhirat kii nijee sampatti nahin he, lekin "crown collection trust", ek charity, dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa he
 Forbes magazine's 2008 estimate listed the Queen's personal assets as $ 650 million, but no official figures are available
 1993 main lord chemberlen ne kaha tha kii press main ghoshit, maharani kii nijee sampatti kaa £100 million kaa anumaan "behad atiranjit tha
 " adhirat kaa landan main aadhikarik nivas buckingham mahal he, jo aadhikarik nivas hone ke alaava adhiktar rajkeey va shahi samarohon kaa bhi mukhya sthal he

 Probably, no other natural event would have generated so much fear, thrill and surprise, nor would it have done even today, as much as the lightning and thunder of the clouds
 anadi kaal se sansar ke praaia: sabhi deshon main yah vishwaas prachlit tha ki tadit ishwar kaa dand he, jiskaa prahaar vah us praani athwa vastu par karata he jiske upar vah kupit ho jaataa he
 The Greeks and Romans considered it to be the execution of the god Jupiter
 aaj bhi bahut se log aisa hi samajhate hai or tadit ke vaigyanik kaaran ko samajhane kii cheshtaa karne ke badale chirposhit andhvishwaas par hi adhik bharosa karte hai
 Many stories told in ancient scriptures emphasize his superstition
 vidyut sambandhi jaankariyon main kuch vruddhi hone par vaigyanikon kii yah dharna bani ki saadhaaran taur par tadit kii ghatana thik usee prakaar kii hoti he jaisaa sanghnitr ko anavisht karte samay uske platon ke bich vaayu main se hokar sphulingon kaa pravaah hota he
 No one had the courage to experiment to confirm this belief; But in the end, inspired by Benjamin Franklin, two French scientists, Dalibard and Delor, decided to carry out the experiment
 unhone dhaatu ke do chad liye
 Dalibard's rod was 40 feet and Delor's rod was 99 feet high
 donon hi chhadon se ve lagbhag dedh inch lambaai tak ke sphulingon kaa visarjan kara sakane main safal hue
 This experiment was very dangerous and later another scientist washed his life while repeating the same experiment
 phir bhi uparyukt prayog se yah nishchay na ho sakaa ki chado main utpann vidyut badalon se hi ai he, kyonki chhadon kii pahunch badalon tak nahin thi
 That's why Benjamin Franklin made his kiteboarding well-known experiment
 usne ek patang udayi or use badalon ke andar tak pahunchaaya
 As soon as the kite is drenched, both the kite and the door get tanned, which shows that both have become electrified
 us door main franklin ne ek chaabi band bhi di thi
 Taking the finger near the key led to the exhalation of the sphincters with the crackling sound of both
 itnaa hi nahin, us chaabi kaa sparsh leden jaar se karakar usne use aaweshit bhi kar liya
 This ensured that clouds also have electricity
 is vidyut ke sphuling rup main visarjan ko hi "tadit' kehete hai
 This immersion can occur between clouds and clouds, or between clouds and earth
 tadit praaia: kapasivarshi meghon main utpann hoti he
 These clouds have very strong upward wind currents, reaching a height of about 40,000 feet
 inamen kuch aisi kriyaayein hoti hai jinke kaaran inamen vidyut aaveshon kii utpatti tathaa viyojan hota rahata he
 For the explanation of these actions, Wilson, Simpson, Sucrez, etc
 have presented their theories, which seem to be conflicting, but all of them tell that the thirst of the thunder is in the clouds and for this, the watercourse existing in those clouds, or Precipitation particles, such as snowflakes, are responsible
 badalon main vidyudvitaran ke sambandh main bhi sabhi ekamat hai ki inke upree str dhanavisht tathaa madhya or nimnastar rinavishti hoten hai
 The division of these charges is also well above the zero degree c temperature levels inside the clouds
 isse yah nishkarsh sahaj hi praapt hota he ki aveshvibhaajan meghon main bananevaale himakanon tathaa urdhvagami pavandhaaraon se hi hota he, jal kii boondon se nahin
 Sometimes, even in low levels, there becomes a center of positive charges
 badalon ke nimna staron par rinvesh utpann ho jane ke kaaran neeche prithvi ke tal par preran dwaara dhanavesh utpann ho jate hai
 As the clouds move forward, these positive charges on the earth also move in the same way
 rinaveshon ke dwaara aakarshith hokar bhootal ke dhanavesh prithvi par khadi suchalak yaa ardhchaalak vastuon par upar tak chadh jate hai
 By this method, when the electrification of the clouds reaches the limit that the voltage gradient between the neighboring charges reaches the fractional value, then the dissolution of the electromagnet is in the form of long sphulings
 ise tadit kehete hai
 The lightning that comes towards the Earth reaches through several stages
 badalon se electranon kaa ek hillol 1 micro second main 50 meter neeche aata he or ruk jaataa he
 After about 50 Ma to 0, the second sequence starts, and in the same way, this wave reaches the earth at the end
 ise pramukh aghat kehete hai
 It takes a total time of 0
002 seconds to reach the Earth from its origin
 uparyukt tathy shonland tathaa unke sahyogiyon dwaara atyant sugrahi camere kii sahaayta se liye gaye photo chitra se prakat hue the
 On the same photo plaque, it was also shown that at the moment of reaching the earth, a very bright light went from the earth towards the clouds in the same order through which the main sequence came
 ise pratigaami apaat kehete hai
 While the average velocity of the principal sequence is 105 m per second, the velocity of the retrograde half is 107 m per second, because its path is already paved due to ionization
 uparyukt pramukh or pratigaami aghaton ke baad bhi kai aghat kramash:- neeche or upar kii ore aate-jate dikhalaai padate hai
 These are called secondary shock
 neeche aanevaale ye dwitiyak aghat pramukh aghat kii bhanti kramon main nahin aate
 CF Wagner and GD mccann have stated that the potential of clouds is often of the order of two million volts
 simpasan or scrage ne prayogon dwaara yah nishkarsh praapt kiya ki 10,000 foot kii oonchaai par sthit badalon ke vibhav kaa praaia: 50 se 100 volt prati senmi0 kii dar se patan hota he
 In the middle of the lightning process, the value of electrification varies from two to fifteen thousand amperes
 is prachand dhara ke kaaran tadit ke path main vidypan vaayu ke anu or parmaanu ynit ho jate hai or prakaash utpann karte hai
 This glow is visible to us as Damini
 yah spasht he ki vaayu se hokar badalon or prithvi ke bich vidyudvisarjan vahiin adhik sambhavya hoga jahaan vidyut ko vaayu kaa pratirodh kam se kam paar karnaa padegaa
 That is why lightning occurs mostly on high towers, tall buildings, solitary trees and flag bearers etc
 One of the reasons for this is that the closer the object is to the cloud, the greater the charge will be generated on it
 iske atirikt sapaat maidan kii apeksha minaaron, vrikshon kii chotiyon aadi ke nukile hone ke kaaran un par vidyut aavesh adhik maatra main ekatra hota he
 Traumatic electronegativity is one-way
 aghat ke lagabhaag paanch microsecond kii avadhi main hi iskaa maan ghaateey kram se badhata hua adhiktam ho jaataa he or lagbhag 25 microsecond ke andar ghatakar aadha maatr rah jaataa he
 This strong current usually lasts 100 microseconds
 iske pashchaat kramash: ghatati hui kuch sahastra ampiore tak pahunch jaati he or kuch sahasrashan second tak aisi hi bani rahati he
 If the stroke does not recur, then this stream becomes less and less
 saamanyatya tadit teen prakaar kii hoti he: Wide lightning occurs over a wide area and its continuous light spreads far enough over the clouds
 dharidaar yaa rekhawarna tadit aksar dikhalaai padati he
 It has one or more luminosities, straight or crooked, visible moving here and there
 isamen vidyudvisarjan badal se badal main, badal se dharti main athwa badal se vayumandal ke bich hota
 This light itself can be of three types: kanduk tadit ek jyotirmaya gend kii bhanti prithvi kii or aati hui dikhalaai padati he
 Its average diameter is 20 cm
 jyon-jyon vah prithvi kii ore agrasar hoti he, iskaa veg ghatata jaataa he
 After appearing for about three to five seconds, she explodes with a very loud sound
 yah bahut hi kam dikhalaai padati he or isaki utpatti kaa kaaran agyaat he
 The lightning barrage system developed by Benjamin Franklin is the best way to protect buildings from the direct trauma of lightning
 lohe kaa ek chad, jiskaa upree sira bhaale kii bhanti nukila hota he or bhawan ke kaaphi upar tak niklaa rahata he, bhawan ke parshv se hota hua bhoomi ke andar kaaphi gaharaai tak gada rahata he
 The lower end is placed in a copper plate in the ground
 yah tadit dand badal main vidyaman tadit ke liye nunatam pratirodh kaa maarg hi nahin prashast karata, pratyut yah bhawan par utpann prerit vidyudaveshon ko tatkaal prithvi ke andar pahunchaa detaa he
 Thus it also significantly reduces the possibility of mutual attraction of charges between clouds and the building
 ateet se hi vidyut jhanjhaaon ke dinon main, navik apane jalayanonke mastulon se is prakaar badalon ke vidyut kaa ksharan dekhte chale aa rahe hai
 This corrosion appears more clear at night
 ise europea navik sant almo kii agni kehete hai
 Many lightning-related experiments are being carried out these days
 ek manoranjak prayog motorcar main ek vyakti ko baitaakar or us motor par kritrim tadit upar se neeche kii ore bhejkar kiya gaya
 Since the electrons present in lightning, due to the same charge, have mutual distraction, they fall apart as they fall on the roof of the motorcar and pass through its walls into the earth below
 isse motor ke andar unki paith na ho saki or vah vyakti sarvatha surakshit rah gaya
 From this experiment, it is decided that in modern metal-framed buildings, whose foundation is very deep, the person sitting is very safe from the lightning strikes
 yadi aise bhawan, athwa taditchaalkayukt bhawan, na mil saken to aise vishaal bhawan main aashray lenaa chahie jo kaaphi vistrut ho
 During a thunderstorm, you should keep yourself away from power, stoves and other conductors of electricity
 baahar rahanewaalon ko pahadiyon ke upar, puaal ityadi ke dher par, ekaaki vrikshon ke neeche, pataakadandon ke paas, athwa kisi prakaar kii dhaatunirmit vastu ke sameep, kabhi na rahanaa chahie, na dhaatu se bani kisi vastu ko hi haath main liye rahanaa chahie
 Living in dense forests or under a sloping hill, it is absolutely safe
 yah aisi vyavastha hoti he jisamen apane upar aropit vibhav ko tatkshan gata dene kaa vishesh gun hota he
 It also prevents an increase in the intensity of the lightning current flowing through it
 isamen saadharantaya ek aantar vyavastha hoti he, jo ek pratirohak se shreneekram main sambhddha hoti he
 Its resistance decreases as the value of the current flowing in it increases
 antar yukti kaa kaary yah hota he ki vah araikhik pratirohak ko prayavarti dhara ke shaktiparipath se sthoolt: pruthak rakhti he

 In the same year he was honored with the Lata Mangeshkar Award by the Government of Madhya Pradesh
 us varsh ke baad se madhyapradesh sarkaar ne "kishor kumaar puraskaar" hindi cinema main yogadan ke liye chaalu kar diya tha
 Kishore Kumar was born on 4 August 1929 in the city of Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh, to a prominent lawyer, Keylal
 kishor kumaar kaa asli naam abhas kumaar ganguli tha
 Kishore Kumar was second among his siblings
 unhone apane jivan ke har kshan main khandwa ko yaad kiya, ve jab bhi kisi saarvajanik manch par yaa kisi samaaroh main apana karykram prastut karte the, shaan se kehete the kishor kumaar khandwe vaale, apni janm bhoomi or mathrubhumi ke prati aisa zazba bahut kam logon main dikhaai detaa he
 Kishore Kumar studied at Christian College, Indore and his habit was to borrow food from the college canteen and feed himself and friends
 vah aisa samay tha jab 10-20 paise kii udhari bhi bahut myne rakhti thi
 On Kishore Kumar, when the canteen's five rupees twelve ana was borrowed and when the owner of the canteen asked him to pay his five rupees twelve, he would sit in the canteen and play a glass and spoon on the table, five rupees twelve ana and sing many tunes
 Used to take out and ignore the canteen
 baad main unhone apane ek geet main is paanch rupaya baarah aana kaa bahut hi khubsuurati se istemaal kiya
 Perhaps very few people will know this real story of the five-rupee twelve-song song
 kishor kumaar ne chaar baar shaadi kii
 His first wife was Bengali singer and actress Ruma Guha Thakurta aka Ruma Ghosh
 unki shaadi 1950 se 1958 tak chali gai 
:53 unki duusari patni abhinetri madhubala thim, jinhone unke gharelu film chalti kaa naam gaadi or jhuumuo sahit kai filmon main unke saath kaam kiya tha
 When Kumar proposed to her, Madhubala was ill and was planning to go to London for treatment
 uske paas ek ventricular ceptal dosha tha, or vah abhi bhi ruma se vivaah kar rahaa tha
 After the divorce, the couple had a civil marriage in 1960 and Kishore Kumar converted to Islam and reportedly changed his name to Karim Abdul
 unke mata-pita ne samaaroh main bhaag lene se inkaar kar diya
 The couple also had a Hindu ceremony to please the parents of the couple, but Madhubala was never accepted as his wife
 unki shaadi ke ek maheene ke bheetar, vah kumaar ghar main tanaav kii vajah se bandra main apane bangale main waapas chali gayi
 They remained married, but under great strain for the rest of Madhubala
 unki shaadi 23 farvari 1969 ko madhubala kii maut ke saath samaapt hui
 Kishore's third marriage was Yogita Bali, and lasted from 1976 to 4 August 1978
 kishor kii shaadi 1980 se unki mrityu tak leena chandaavarkar se hui thi
 They had two sons, Amit Kumar with Ruma, and Sumit Kumar with Leena Chandavarkar
 kishor kumaar kii shuruyaat ek abhinayta ke rup main film shikari se hui
 His elder brother Ashok Kumar played the lead role in this film
 unhen pehali baar gane kaa mauka mila 1948 main bani film ziddee main, jisamen unhone dev anand ke liye gaanaa gaaya
 Kishore Kumar was a huge fan of l Sehgal, so he sang this song in his style
 ziddee kii safalataa ke baavjood unhen na to pahchaan mili or na koi khaas kaam mila
 He acted as a hero in the 1951 film 'andolan' produced by Phani Mazumdar but the film flopped
 1954 main unhone bimal raay kii 'naukari' main ek berojgaar yuvak kii samvedansheel bhoomika nibhaakar apni zabardast abhinay pratibha se bhi parichit kiya
 This was followed by "baap Re Baap" in 1955, "new Delhi" in 1956, "mr
 Meri" and "asha" in 1957, and "chalti Ka Naam Gaadi" in 1958, in which Kishore Kumar shared his two brothers Ashok Kumar and Anoop
 Worked with Kumar and his actress was Madhubala
 yah bhi mjedaar baat he ki kishor kumaar kii shuruyaat kii kai filmon main mohammad rafi ne kishor kumaar ke liye apni aawaaj di thi
 Mohammad Rafi lent his voice to Kishore Kumar in the films 'ragini' and 'mischief' and took only one rupee for remuneration
 kaam ke liye kishor kumaar sabase pehle es di burman ke paas gaye the, jinhone pehle bhi unhen 1950 main bani film "pyaar" main gane kaa mauka diya tha
 SD Burman then gave him a chance to sing a song in the film "bahar"
 kusur aap kaa or yah gaanaa bahut hit hua
 Initially Kishore Kumar was not taken seriously by SD Burman and other composers and they were sung with light-hearted lyrics, but Kishore Kumar made a sad mood in the 1957 film "funtus" by his own songs
 Kishore Kumar's talent was to be reckoned with
 iske baad es di burman ne kishor kumaar ko apane sangeet nirdesan main kai geet gane kaa mauka diya
 Under the music direction of RD Burman, Kishore Kumar played 'munim Ji', 'taxi Driver', 'funtosh', 'nau Do Eleven', 'paying Guest', 'guide', 'jewel Thief', 'prempujari', 'tere' With his magical voice in films like Mere Sapne ', he made the fans of film music crazy
 ek anumaan ke kishor kumaar ne varsh 1940 se varsh 1980 ke bich ke apane kariyar ke dauraan kareeb 574 se adhik gane gaae
 Kishore Kumar sang songs for Hindi as well as films in Tamil, Marathi, Assamese, Gujarati, Kannada, Bhojpuri, Malayalam and Oriya
 kishor kumaar ko aath filmafere puraskaar mili, unako pehla filmafere puraskaar 1969 main aradhana film ke geet rup tera mastaana pyaar meraa divaana ke liye diya gaya tha
 The specialty of Kishore Kumar was that he lent his voice for Dev Anand to Rajesh Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan and his voice was so much like these teenagers as if Kishore himself was present in them
 kishor kumaar ne 81 filmon main abhinay kiya or 18 filmon kaa nirdesan bhi kiya
 In the film 'padosan', he played the role of the cool Maula man in his real life throughout his life
 1975 main desh main apatkaal ke samay ek sarkari samaaroh main bhaag lene se saaf manaa kar dene par tatkaaleen soochna evam prasaaran mantri vidyacharan shukla ne kishor kumaar ke geeton ke akashwani se prasaarit kiye jane par par roak laga di thi or kishor kumaar ke ghar par iskar ke chaape bhi daale gaye
 But Kishore Kumar did not support the Emergency
 yah durbhaagya or shame kii baat he ki kishor kumaar dwaara banaai gai kai filmein iskar vibhaag ne japt kar rakhi he or laavaaris sthiti main vahaan apni durdasha par ansu baha rahi he
 Kishore Kumar started a struggle in the golden period of Indian cinema when his brother Ashok Kumar was established as a successful star
 dilip kumaar, raaj kapur, dev anand, balraj saahani, gurudutt or rahamaan jaise kalakaaron ke saath hi parshvagayan main mohammad rafee, mukesh, talat mahmud or manna de jaise diggaj gayakon kaa bolbalaa tha
 Kishore Kumar was first married to Ruma Devi, but soon the marriage broke up and after this he married Madhubala
 us daur main dilip kumaar jaise safal or shoharat kii bulandiyon par pahunche abhinayta jahaan madhubala jaisi rup sundari kaa dil nahin jeet paae vahi madhubala kishor kumaar kii duusari patni bani
 The two came together in the 1961 film "jhumru"
 yah film kishor kumaar ne hi banaai thi or unhone khud hi iskaa nirdesan kiya tha
 After this, the two worked together in the 1962 film "half Ticket", in which Kishore Kumar presented a different image by doing a memorable comedy
 1976 main unhone yogita bali se shaadi kii magar in donon kaa yah saath maatr kuch maheenon kaa hi rahaa
 After this Yogita Bali married Mithun Chakraborty
 1980 main kishor kumaar ne chauthi shaadi leena chandravarkar se kii jo umr main unke bete amit se do saal badi thim
 Manoj Kumar narrates a memorable anecdote about Kishore Kumar
 ek baar unki film ' upkaar ' ke liye kishor kumaar ko gaanaa gane ke liye aamantrit kiya to vah yah kahkar bhaag khadey hue ki ve to film ke hero ke liye hi gane gaate hai, kisi khalanaayak par filmaaya jane vaala gaanaa nahin ga sakate
 But when this song of 'upkar' 'kasme Vaade Pyaar Wafaa 


' became a hit, Kishore Kumar went to Manoj Kumar and started saying that he missed the opportunity to sing such a good song
 iske saath hi unhone yah sweekaar karne main bhi der nahin kii ki manna de ne jis khubsuurati se is gane ko gaaya he aisa to main kai janmon tak nahin ga sakuunga
 It is good that i did not sing this song, otherwise people would have been deprived of this beautiful voice of Manna Dey in such a good song

 Although there was never a lack of political consciousness in the eastern part, the eastern part could never get proper representation in the power of the country and always remained politically neglected
 isse purvi pakistan ke logon main jabardast naaraazgi thi
 And to take political advantage of this resentment, Bangladesh leader Sheikh mujib-ur-rehman formed Awami League and demanded more autonomy within Pakistan

 Gemology, or crystal science, is the study of the shape, properties and structure of crystals or crystals
 'crystal' greek bhashaa ke shabd crustalos se vyutpann he
 Crustalos originally means "snow", but the term later came to be used for rock crystals, a colorless translucent variety of quartz
 iske vishay main pracheen kaal main logon kii dharna thi ki yah atyadhik thand ke kaaran pani ke jamane se banataa he
 Shanai: Shanai: The word "crystal" came to be used for any mineral, which by nature is surrounded by simple faces
 yah shabd anguthi main jade janevaale ratnon tathaa anya aabhushanon ke liye prayukt nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki unamem jo suvyavasthit samtal falak dikhaai dete hai ve prakritik reeti se nahin bane hai, varan kritrim hai
 These panels are made after cutting and polishing
 sachche crystal ke falak prakritik crystalan ke falswaroop banate hai, crystalan kriya chaahe bhupatal main hui ho yaa prayogshaala main
 In the second stage, matter and atmosphere are prepared by humans for the Kistalan, but the actual creation of the crystal and its specific facets develop without human intervention
 ye falak ek vishesh aantarik parmaanu sanrachana ke falswaroop nirmit hote hai
 The physical properties of crystals depend on this structure
 kaanch ke bane ek kritrim ratna main niyamit aantarik sanrachana nahin hoti he, at: bahya rup main crystal ke samaan hote hue bhi uski gananaa crystal main nahin kii jaati
 Thus, the true identity of a crystal is by the regular configuration of the atoms of its molecules
 crystal ek sam pind he, jo praaia: thos hota he or chaaron ore se chikne samtal falkon se, vishisht siddhanton ke aadhaar par, ghira rahata he
 Its physical properties remain fixed
 iske bahya rup or bhautik gun donon hi niyamit aantarik sanrachana ke bahari parichaayak hai
 Most minerals, which are formed under suitable conditions, are crystals
 kuch aise padaarth hai, jinhen ham taral crystal kehete hai
 Although there is evidence of regular atomic configuration, they are not true solids
 duusari ore kuch aise thos khanij hai, jinamein niyamit parmanviya sanrachana nahin milti
 These are called Ravahin
 kuch crystal bahut hi chote hote hai
 The development of their faces is not clear even with the help of microscope
 inhen gudh crystali kehete hai
 The term crystalline can generally be used for any substance in which atoms are arranged in a regular way, but the term crystal is used for those crystalline materials that are surrounded by flat faces
 crystal kaa aakaar crystalan-samay par nirbhar karata he
 The more slowly the crystallization, the larger the crystals become
 jab cristajan jaldi hota he, tab anuon ko vikaas centre kii ore adhik sankhya main jane kaa avasar nahin miltaa
 Due to this, large crystals are not formed

 In the study of mineralogy, crystalski is important
 bhupatal main paae janevaale khanij praaia: samang crystalia thos hote hai
 Most of these well-developed crystal shapes, which are associated with internal molecular structure, are found
 inamen hira, laal, neelam, pann, pukhraj, amithist aadi ratna khanij vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai
 These crystalline minerals, which do not appear to have crystal figures, are grinded to extract thin fragments and tested by polarization microscope

 This science is equally useful in the study of solid organic and inorganic compounds
 inamen se bahut se yogicon main crystalki akritiyaan banati hai, jo unke pahchaanane main sahaayta detii he
 Crystalline materials that do not show easily recognizable crystal shapes, or that are too small to be studied by crystallometry, are analyzed by X-ray
 is prakaar kuch vidhiyon se praapt photograph ke pratirupon kii, aatanrik crystalia samamiti ke aadhaar par, vyakhya kii jaati he, jisase unhen pahchaanane main laabh uthaaya jaataa he
 a crystal is a regular community composed of the repetition of a unit of a particular gain model

 The study of crystallon is indispensable for metallurgy
 kuch dhaatuen, jaise sona, chaandi or tanba, jo bhupatal main shuddh tatwon ke rup main praapt hoti hai, crystalia swaroop dikhalaati hai, lekin un kuch dhaatuon kii, jo khanijon se nikaali jaati hai, bahya akritiyaan crystalan vidhi ko nahin batalaati
 Structure Christianity methods are used to study the internal structure and symmetry of these metals

 These minerals range in size from very small particles to colloidal measurements and have been divided into three classes
 eks-re vishleshan se gyaat hua he ki ye khanij crystalia hai
 External shapes of many of these crystals have been observed by electron microscope, which has a million times magnification
 sanrachana crystalki kii bahut si vidhiyaan tathakthith drav crystalon, jaise cholesteroil isitate, ammonium oliet aadi, ke adhyayan main safalataa se upyog kii gai hai
 These crystals were considered to be definitely fluid in ancient times
 par ye madhyarupiy avasthaa main thos hi he
 The fluid nature seen in them, or the lack of firmness, is due to the weakness of the forces of the crystal, which are not powerful enough to maintain a certain geometric shape
 crystalki ko sabase pehali mahatvapurn dein denmarkwasi chikitsak nicholas stanon kii he
 In 1669, you told that some angles of a crystal are always equal, no matter how different the shape and size of the faces

 There was no special progress in the field of crystalski in the 18th century
 keval vilaayakon ke, jinamein viley padaarth the, vashpikaran se crystal taiyaar kiye gaye
 These were called 'artificial crystals'

 For other shapes, it is envisaged that they are formed by substitution by the sides and cubic angles of each of the above figures
 rome di l oil kii pehali kriti 1772 i main prakashit hui
 His second detailed edition was printed in 1783 AD
 aapke kaary ke falswaroop antarafalak kone kii sthirataa kaa niyam, jisaki neenv 100 varsh purv stanon dwaara rakhi ja chuki thi, purna rup se sthapit ho gaya
 Although crystallologists were already hypothesizing about the possible internal structure of the crystal, a systematic description of this was first made by Abi Oui in 1784 AD
 crystal kii akruti se sambhddha vidalan kii satahon kaa nirikshan karte samay aapane yah vichaar sthapit kiya ki ek crystal sab se choti sambhav anu ekak kii punrariti se bana he
 The shape of this basic unit was assumed to correspond to the symmetry of that crystal
 isi ekak ke aadhaar par bhinn bhinn swabhaav ke crystalon kii rachana ho sakati thi, yadi chayan kii pragati ke saath saath kuch panktiyaan niyamit rup se chhod di jaatin
 Thus a heterogeneous dodecahedron can be formed from the unit of the cube if the "cube" at the edges is omitted when selecting the cube sample
 yahi ikai ek ashtafalak bana sakati he, yadi konon par se ghanakon kaa chayan chhod diya jaay
 On the basis of the relation of the complete crystal and its fundamental unit, Oui established the rule of "rational exponents", which is the most important law of crystals
 aui kii is khoj kii mahatta kaa anumaan isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unhen crystalki kaa janmdata kaha jaataa he
 In 1830, based on Oui's rule of "rational exponents", Hazel discovered that 32 types of symmetries are possible in solid bodies with flat faces
 aapkaa kaary dirghakaal tak anjaane main hi padaa rahaa
 Independently, Gadolin Fon Lang also came to the same conclusion that Hazel had reached, and he fully established this fact in 1870 AD
 aui kii khoj ke pashchaat crystal kii aantarik sanrachana ke kaary main pragati hoti rahi or yah maan liya gaya ki brihat crystal kii sanrachana crystal kii aanvik ikai yaa bahuanvik ikaayiyon ke crystal dwaara ghire sthaan kii punrariti ke falswaroop hoti he
 The names of Seiber, Dena, Brewster, Delafoss etc
 are notable in this region
 par crystal kii ikaayiyon kii rachana or akruti ke sambandh main koi vishesh pragati nahin hui
 Over the years, many mathematicians and crystallologists have been searching for the different configurations by which crystals from different communities are made up of their unit cells
 is disha main pehali kriti frankenhim kii thi
 They believed that 15 different configurations are possible
 ye vinyas trivimzalak prakruti ke the
 Braves provided strong evidence for Frankenheim's stereoscopes and also showed that two of those 15 configurations are exactly the same
 usne in 14 trivimzalkon ko, jo crystal sanrachana kii neenv hai, saat samudaayon main vibhakt kar diya 
 Brevais also suggested that the geometric arrangement of atoms around the gravitational center of each molecule is the same
 duusare shabdon main, breves ke trivimzalak main prayek bindu kaa paryaavaran prayek duusare bindu ke paryaavaran ke samaan he or yah samaan rup se hi abhivinyast he
 The above point represents the center of gravity of the molecules
 yahi siddhant viner ne bhi swatantra rup se sthapit kiya
 Under the regularity of the arrangement of identical atoms, each such atom comes around which other atoms are arranged in the same manner
 usee varsh jordan ne crystalon kaa sandarbh na dekar, keval ganit ke aadhaar par yah pataa lagaaya ki tathakthith sarvatha sambhaagon kii niyamit aavriti kitne prakaar se sambhav he
 By following Weiner's theory and applying Jordan's method to crystals, Sohnke discovered that 65 points can be arranged in specific ways in the recess, while requiring only the same environment and not the same orientation, as in Bravis' stereoscope
 
 in 65 bindusamudaayon se aisi sanrachanaatmak vyavastha praapt hui jisase keval vibhinn samudaayon ke purnafalkeey varg kii hi nahin, jaisaa ki brevais trivimzalak main bhi thi, varan usase bhi neeche ke bahut se virgon kii samamiti praapt hui
 By incorporating reflection and inversion functions in the stereoscopic, Fedoroff, Schoenfleis, and Barlow studied 195 structural atomology systems independently and in various ways
 is prakaar sab bindu samudaay yaa varg 230 ho gaye
 Now it became possible to understand the symmetry of the lower series
 is prakaar sthapit 32 samamiti varg crystal samamiti ke 32 virgon se, jo ki akritik crystalki main maane jate hai, mail khate hai
 Although the geometrical theory of crystal structure was successfully established at the end of the last century, crystal specialists were unaware of the size, measurement, and nature of the fundamental unit of the crystal
 ikaayiyon ko ab tak aui kaa ghan samaantarfalak, yaa fedoroff kaa samaatanr falak, samajha jaataa tha
 In the idea of pope and hair these multifaceted units are derived from condensed sets of elastic, but incompressible and deformable spheres

 Some scientists thought of using the ordered atoms of the crystal as a proper grating for diffraction of the x ray beam
 is sambandh main pehle prayog unke saathiyon, freedrick or nipping, dwaara kiye gaye
 White x rays were sent in a crystal and were taken on a photographic plate
 is plate ko dhone par ek kendriya kaale hisse ke chaaron ore bahut se kaale dhabbe prakat hue, jo ek niyamit pattern main the
 The study of this type of photograph made it possible to know the structure of relatively simple crystals

 Bragg rotated the cut plates in known directions of the crystals on an X-ray spectrometer, which arranged for using monochromatic radiation

 Some curve lines were obtained when developing the film thus affected
 yahi acks kiran vyatikaran akritiyaan thim
 Schibold devised a method in which the entire crystal is rotated in a main mantle and monochromatic radiation is applied to it
 isamen vivartan jaanane ke liye yaa to ek sapaat yaa ek belanaakaar photographic plate kaam main laai ja sakati he
 By this method the dimensions of the unit cell of the crystal can be precisely measured
 is ghurnan vidhi main wisenvarg ne or sudhaar kiya
 The crystal is oscillated within a small angle range and the cylindrical camera rotates along the crystal in such a way that it stays with it at the time of exposure
 eks kiran vishleshan dwaara gyaat kii gai ikai koshika kii vimayein praaia: sabhi khanijon main crystal konemapi dwaara jane hue akshanupaat se mail khaati hai
 By x-ray analysis, we can fully know the structure of the crystal
 pehle crystal ko uchit trivim varg main rakhaa jaataa he, tatpashchaat uski ikai koshika kii anrtvastu kii jaankaree kii jaati he
 The crystal is surrounded by surfaces from all four sides

 Plaque is generally flat and smooth
 falak ek hi praroop yaa bhinn bhinn praroop ke ho sakate hai
 If all the panels are of the same type and are developed equally, then their geometric shapes are the same
 lekin inhen ek kism ke falkon kii akruti bhinn ho jaati he, yadi ve duusari kism ke falkon ke sangyojan main praapt hote hai
 All panels of the same type are members of a crystal form
 yah rup un falkon kaa jod he jinaki upasthiti us sthiti main crystal samamiti ke liye aavashyak hoti he jab ki unamem se koi ek upasthit ho
 The number of these faces depends on the crystal symmetry
 do sanlagn ko milaanevaali rekha ko crystal kaa kor kehete hai
 The corner where three or more faces meet is called Conia, which many authors call a cube angle
 bahufalak ke samaan crystal main bhi falak sankhya or konia kii sankhya kaa jod kor kii sankhya or do ke jod ke baraabar ho jaataa he
 The angle between the interface elements drawn on two faces in a crystal is called the angle of the interface
 yah baat dhyaan main rakhane kii he ki yah kone falkon ke bich ke vaastavik kone kaa poorak he
 This particular type of interface angle corresponds to the method of measuring angles
 yah ek ore ganitiya pariklan or duusari ore crystal ke falkon ke trivim nirupan or tadnantar goleey trikonmiti dwaara pariklan ke bhi anukool he
 To measure the interface angle of relatively large crystals, a contact crystal angiometer, made by Karangyo in 1870 AD, is used
 crystal main bahut se falak is prakaar vyavasthit ho sakate hai ki unki sataha, jahaan par ki sanlagn jode milte hai, samaantar hon
 The community of such faces is called Mandal
 vah kaalpanik rekha, jo crystal ke centre se hokar guzarati he tathaa jo koron ke samaantar hoti he, mandal aksh kehalaati he or vah samtal, jisamen mandal ke sabhi falkon ke abhilamb padate hai, mandaltal kehalaata he
 Plaques can be of one or several forms
 crystal ko kaagaj par pradarshit karne ke bahut se tareeke hai
 a straightforward and simple method is to draw a similar map of the crystal cores, as they appear from a point at a finite distance just above them
 do samaan drishy bhi pradarshit kiye ja sakate hai, pehla jaisaa ki saamne se dikhaai de or doosraa jaisaa ki dayee ore se dikhaai de
 These three views represent the foundation configuration of engineering, front hoisting and side hoisting respectively
 nirupan kii yah vidhi lambkoniya prakshep kehalaati he
 In gradient interpolation, the crystal is projected over a vertical plane
 isamen crystal ek aise bindu se dekha jaataa he, jo sabase upar ke falak, yaa konia, kii sataha se anant duuri par 9degree 28" tathaa dai ore 18degree 26" par hota he
 The faces of the crystals are arranged according to the symmetry determined schemes
 kuch aadhaar chinhon, kaa jinhen samamiti ke mul avyav kehete hai, adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 These components are as follows: yadi crystal main ek samamiti samtal upasthit he, to vah crystal ko do samroop tathaa baraabar bhaagon main is prakaar vibhajit karata he ki ek hissaa duusare kaa pratibimb hota he
 If the crystal has a symmetric axis, by rotating the crystal on that axis, the whole specified form of the crystal appears more than once, two, three, four times in a whole circle
 is drushti se samamiti aksh ko dvikoniya, trikoniya, chatushkoniya, yaa shatkoniya samamiti aksh kehete hai
 The crystals have to rotate 180 °, 120 °, 90 ° and 60 ° respectively for the above symmetry axes
 shatkoniya samamiti aksh se adhik kii aksheeya samamiti crystalon main sambhav nahin he
 And neither axonal axial symmetry is possible
 yadi crystal main samamiti centre upasthit he, to crystal ke ek bhaag main vidyaman ek konia, ek kor yaa ek falak kii sangat konia, kor yaa falak crystal ke vipareet bhaag main bhi vidyaman hota he
 In order to know the symmetry components and their properties in a crystal, the crystal is imagined free from irregularities resulting from uneven growth of homogeneous faces, as is usually the case in nature
 keval jyamitiya samamiti kii dasha main samamiti centre yaa ek samtal ke vipareet pashrv main vidyaman konia, kor yaa falak, samaan duuri par sthit hone chahie
 In this, the opposite faces are also of the same shape and form
 crystal sanrachanaatmak samamiti main antarafalak kone kii samamiti hi nishchayatmak avyav he, falkon kaa vistaar or akruti prakritik virupan ke kaaran mahatv nahin rakhte hai
 The reason for the deformation in the crystal is the purity of the solvents or the adversity in the growth speed, heat, or compression of the crystal
 yahi tathy crystal ke vishesh rup ko nishchit karte hai
 The particular form of the crystal is the result of the sum of the symptoms present and the relative expansion of the faces of each form
 crystal main vidyaman pradhan falak samashtiyon, athwa crystal main ek yaa do dishaao main adhik vikaas ke kaaran bananevaale prijmiya or sapaat roopon ke liye prayukt shabdon, ke saath ""vishesh rup"" shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Ancient workers made the rule of symmetry by thoroughly studying the characteristics of symmetry of the crystal
 yah sutara yaa niyam is prakaar he : ek crystal ke falak samamiti ke nishchit avyav ke anusaar sthit hote hai
 The position of the faces remains fixed for that crystal and on this depends its external appearance and physical properties
 pehle kaaryakartaaon ne bhi yah gyaat kiya tha ki ek padaarth ke crystal chaahe kitna hi vibhinn rup dikhalaayen, par unke sangat antarfalak kone kii sthirataa kaa mul sutara he
 Crystalline axes are imaginary lines that pass through the center of the crystal
 crystal ke falkon kii sthiti batalaane ke liye in kalpit rekhaon kaa upyog sandarbh akshon ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Generally these axes are main symmetry axes, or parallel to some cores
 crystal ke swabhaav ke aadhaar par teen samamiti samatalon par abhilamb hote hai yaa crystal kii kuch yaa chaar aise aksh maan liye ja sakate hai
 It is not necessary that the axes are equal to each other, or bend equally to each other
 in akshon kii aapekshik lambaaiyon ko hi 'aksheeya anupaat' kehete hai
 They are mostly written by x, y, z
 inamen se y ko hi ikai maanane kii pratha he
 The relative distances at which the crystalline axes of the crystal pane intersect are called the intersecting proportions
 vah falak, jo akshon ko is prakaar katata he ki un duriyon kaa anupaat kramik akshon kii ikaayiyon ke anupaat ke samaan hota he, ekak falak, yaa paramitary samtal kehalaata he
 In order to determine the unit pane, only the most commonly found pane is chosen
 kisi bhi falak kaa aakaar, yaa pravanta unke ikai antarkhandon dwaara batalaai ja sakati he
 If a panel intersects a, b, c on the three axes x, y, z, then their relation can be represented by ax, by, cz according to Vice's method
 vaais kii parameter vidhi ke sthaan par ghaataank vidhi, jise sabase pehle miller ne lokapriy banaaya, adhik prachlit he
 If the inverse or exponent of this method is in fraction, it is used to multiply and convert them into whole numbers
 at: yadi ek falak, x aksh ko ekak duuri se dugane sthaan par or y ko tiguni duuri par, katata he tathaa z ke samaantar he, to iskaa vaais chihn 2 x, 3 y, ¥ z hoga
 Their derivatives will be 1 / 2, 1 / 3 1 / 4
 6 se guna karne par yah 3, 2, 0 ho jayega
 Hence the millerchir of this panel will be written 3, 2, 0 and it will be read three, two, zero
 kabhi-kabhi ise chote koshthak main rakhaa jaataa he, kyonki eks kiran crystalki main bina koshthak ke chinhr rachana-samatalon ke dyotak hote hai
 In the middle brackets, it denotes the entire form of the {3 2 0} pane and in larger brackets it denotes a circle
 crystalki kii sabhi vidhiyon, goniometary pathan, trivimiya prakshep tathaa ganitiya pariklan ke liye milan chihn mahatvapurn he
 It has been known from experience that normally only those panels in a crystal have axial integuments, which are minor, or infinite, of the unit
 isi prakaar miller ghaataank saral parimey sankhya yaa shunya hote hai
 This is called the rational exponential rule
 isamen aise ghaataank jaise 20
5 yaa 1
327 xxrep 5 
 aadi, sambhav nahin he
 To explain different types of crystals, different positions of crystalline axes are imagined to be convenient
 inkaa chah crystal samudaayon main vargeekaran kiya gaya he
 The interpretation of each community depends on the form of the axes
 in chah samudaayon main se paanch main akshon kii sankhya teen teen hai tathaa chathe main upyog ke vichaar se teen kii apeksha chaar aksh adhik suvidhajanak gyaat hue hai
 The diversity of communities depends on the same or uneven bending of the axes and the intersecting proportions being the same or unequal on the different axes of the unit pane
 teenon akshon ko is prakaar abhivinyast kiya jaataa he ki tathakthith l aksh udagr rahata he, r prekshak ke samantaravaale udagr samtal main sthit rahata he or teesraa ya aksh prekshak ke sanmukh rahata he
 The upper, right and front ends of L, r and z respectively are called money and their opposite ends are called debt
 yadi kisi falak dwaara kisi aksh kaa rinbhaag ant:khandit hota he, tab usase sambandhit milatar ghaataank ke upar rin kaa chihr bana diya jaataa he
 In Trinitaksha community, all the three axes, circles are of uneven lengths and are inclined at each other, making oblique angles
 eknataksh samudaay main ya, r, l asmaan hai
 y and l make oblique angles to each other, but r lies perpendicular to the plane in which y and l are
 vishamalambaaksh samudaay main ya, r l asmaan hai, lekin ek duusare par samaan rup se jhuke hue hai
 The hexagonal community consists of three equal horizontal axes Y1, Y2, Y3, which intersect each other at an angle of Rs 60 and the fourth axis l is uneven and perpendicular to the plane of the first three axes
 chatushkoniya samudaay main do samaan kshaitij aksh ya1 or ya2 ek duusare par samakon banaate hai or udagr aksh l asmaan he
 The three axes of the Trismalambaksha community are similar and form a right angle to each other
 ya1, ya2 kshaitij hai or ya3 udagr he
 Such forms are found in different crystals of the same community, which appear to be identical from the point of view of the crystalline axis, but differ on the number of their faces and the symmetry of symmetric elements
 vastav main inamen se kuch purna yaa purnafalkeey rup hai, jinamein us samudaay kii purna samamiti ke liye aavashyak sabhi samtal vidyaman rahete hai
 Some of these forms are partial, such as semicircular and quadrangular figures
 ardhafalakeey akritiyon main usee samudaay kii purnafalkeey akritiyon ke aadhe falak or chaturthanshfalakeey akritiyon main ek chauthai falak vidyaman rahete hai
 Apart from this, there is also another partial form, which is called the Ardhakriti form
 isamen ek purnafalkeey crystal ke aadhe falak crystal ke keval ek hi ore kendrit hote hai, yaa ban jate hai, shesh aadha bhaag yaa to anupasthit rahata he, yaa vahaan par duusare rup kaa aadha bhaag nirupati rahata he
 Associated with any community, these forms are of lower grade symmetry than the full-fledged form of that community
 at: kisi bhi samudaay ke crystal bhinn bhinn samamiti virgon ke antargat aate hai
 Symmetry classes are named based on the most common form of that class
 samamiti ke sabhi sambhavya sanmilan par saidhantik rup se vichaar kar, samamiti ke 32 varg nirdhaarit kiye gaye hai
 Generally only 11 of these are found in minerals, the other 13 are rare in minerals and artificial crystals and the other 6 are found only in artificial crystals
 shesh do or abhi bhi anirupit hai
 The forms are given certain general names based on the positions of the faces associated with the crystalline axes
 pinecoid main unke rachak falak keval ek hi crystalia aksh ko katate hai tathaa donon ke samaatanr hote hai
 The panels of the prism are parallel to the vertical axis and intersect the other two axes
 dom ke falak udagr aksh or ek pashrv aksh ko katate hai tathaa duusare parshv aksh ke samaatanr hote hai
 The panes of the pyramid intersect all axes
 crystal prakruti main saamanyat: nahin dikhaai padate hai or na prayogshaala main hi unka bananaa saral he
 Mostly they are found in aggregates, which are homogeneous, or heterogeneous, in which the sum of different crystals varies
 samaangi samucchy main bahudhaa crystalon kaa samaantar vikaas dikhalaai padataa he, jaise fitkaree, tanba, hematite or him main
 Sometimes the separation is partial, as in the Yamal crystals
 bahuteron main to samaantaran bilkul hi nahin dikhaai detaa
 In these, the crystalline units are disordered and thus form an "irregular set"
 isi prakaar "vishmangi samucchy" main bhi lagbhag purna samaantaran ho saktaa he jhrjaisa samakritik vruddhi ment yaa aanshik samaantaran ho saktaa he, yaa samaantaran kaa purna abhaav ho saktaa he
 Yamal crystals have two or more crystals interconnected in such a way that a part is made up of the reflection of the enclosed part
 aisa prathit hota he ki yamal crystal kaa ek bhaag apni moulik sthiti se aksh ke upar 180rou ghumaya gaya he
 The above-mentioned reflection plane is equally related to both parts of the Yamal crystal, but this plane is not the symmetric plane of either of those two parts
 yahi kalpit samtal yamal samtal or aksh yamal aksh kehalaata he
 These two form right angles at each other
 vah samtal jahaan par do sanlagn bhaag aapas main mili rahete hai sanmilan tal kehalaata he
 In most cases, it is Yamal level
 sansparsh yamalon main ek spasht sanmilan tal hota he, jaise orthoklez spinel or caceterite main
 But no such level is seen in the intrusive Yamal, such as storolite, fluorite and pyrite
 pichley udhaaharan main crystal paraspar antarvenshi hote hai
 Recurring Yamals are formed from three or more crystals
 isi ke antargat aate hai, bahusanshleshi yamal tathaa chakree yugma
 In multispectral Yamal, successive concordance planes are parallel, as in albite, and cyclic pairs do not have parallel surfaces, as in rutile
 chakree yamal ke dwaara nichi shrenee kii samamiti ke crystal kabhi kabhi apekshaakrit unchi shrenee kii samamiti ke crystalon kaa anukaran karte hai
 The reason for the polymerization in crystals is the lack of complete separation of molecules, which is due to the lack of proper time for the molecules in the process of crystallization
 chakree yamalon main yamalan crystalon kii ucch samamiti praapt karne kaa asafal prayaas hi prathit hota he
 The internal molecular arrangement of a crystal depends not only on its external appearance but also on its physical properties
 inamen se kuch gun to crystal kii pratirohak shakti se gyaat hote hai, jab use todaa, khurcha yaa jhukaaya jaataa he
 Other properties of crystals are related to light and heat, and to magnets and electrodes
 gailena, pirit, kailcite tathaa anya bahut se khanijon ke crystal nishchit samtal satahon par se, jo crystal ke sambhavya falak yaa falkon ke samaantar hoti hai, tuutate hai
 This property is called Vidalan
 isse gyaat hota he ki sasanjak bal kuch dishaao main anya dishaao kii apeksha durbal hai
 Crystals that do not have a cleavage surface are fractured
 yah vibhang shankhabh hota he, arthath sataha tuutane par chikani tathaa natodar hoti hai, yaa assam ho sakati he
 Crystals are mostly brittle, meaning they can be broken into small pieces easily, or their powder can be made easily
 crystalia akruti kii dhaatuon main se kuch, jaise sona, chaandi, tanba, aghatvadhry hai, arthath hathode se petakar inaki chadar taiyaar kii ja sakati he
 Some are perforated, ie can be cut into thin sheets, while others are tensile, ie their strings can be pulled
 kuch crystal, jaise chlorite, namya hote he, jabaki anya, jaise abhrak, pratyasth hote hai
 The resistance that a crystal exhibits in the scraper is called its hardness
 bhinn bhinn kathorta ke das prakaar ke crystalon se ek maapak taiyaar kiya gaya he, jisaki sahaayta se crystal kii kathorta kii sankhya batalaai jaati he
 To know the hardness of the crystal on this scale, it is seen that which of the ten scraps the crystal
 sabase komaltam crystal talk kaa tathaa sabase kathor heere kaa he
 The scale has approximately equal intervals up to 9
 hira, jisaki is paimaane par apekshaakrit kathorta 10 he, nirpeksh maap ke hisaab se 42
4 he
 Hence there is a relatively large gap between 9 and 10
 kuch crystalon main dishaao ke saath saath kathorta badalati rahati he
 This is due to the difference in internal molecule
 yah badi rochak baat he ki graphite kii, jiskaa rasinic sanghatan heere ke samaan he, kathorta do se bhi kam he
 a particular type of internal molecular arrangement of crystals is manifested in depositional shapes
 nikshaaran akritiyaan crystal ke falkon par kisi uchit vilaayak kii kriya ke falswaroop nirmit hoti hai
 The symmetry of these shapes corresponds to the molecular structure below
 ye akritiyaan chote-chote gadadhon yaa avanaman ke rup main hoti hai tathaa nishchit jyamitiya akruti kii hoti hai or dhalwaan samatalon se ghiri rahati hai
 Some properties of crystals depend on light
 crystal kii chamak uski sataha se paravartit prakaash kii maatra or gun par hi nirbhar he
 The brightest visible light from the opaque crystals of a metallic compound is called radiant
 yadi yah apekshaakrit kam chamakdaar hai, to ise dhatmik kehete hai
 According to these, for the translucent and non-metallic crystals, the terms Hirakasam and Kachabha are used respectively
 anya saamaanya chamak reshmi, rezini, motiyaa, chikani, yaa dhyutiheen kehalaati he
 The crystal is not always the same in different inverting samples
 ek dhaatu crystal main, jiskaa rang gaharaa hota he, uske kas kaa adhyayan karnaa laabhakaari hota he
 The color of the powder can be seen by rubbing the crystals on the surface of an unbleached sugar clay
 prakaash kii sanchaar karne kii kshamta ke aadhaar par crystal paardarshak, alpapaardarshak tathaa apaardarshak hota he
 Some crystals exhibit polymorphism, ie different colors in different conditions
 aisa bhinn bhinn crystalia dishaao main sanchaarit prakaash ke varanatmak avasorana ke kaaran hota he
 Light gets refracted from the air medium to an opaque crystal, that is, it changes its direction in proportion to the damping velocity
 vaayu tathaa crystal main prakaash ke veg kii nishpatti ko hi crystal kaa apvartanaank kehete hai
 Crystals of gemstone minerals are so much brighter and more attractive due to their higher refractive index
 heere kii chamak uske ucch apvartanaank 2
419, ke hi kaaran he, jabaki fluorite kii kachabh chamak uske nimna apvartanaank, 1
434, kii dyotak he
 The refractive index of water is 1
33 and the refractive index of crown glass is 1
53
 trisamalambaaksh samudaay ke prayek crystal kaa apvartanaank sabhi dishaao main samaan hota he
 Thus, such crystals are isosceles
 anya samudaayon ke crystal vishamdaishik hote hai
 When a ray of light enters an anisotropic crystal it splits into two rays and thus bi-refraction occurs
 donon kirane bhinn bhinn veg se chalati hai tathaa apni yatra kii bhinn bhinn dishaao main bhi ye badalati rahati hai
 Crystals of tetragonal and hexagonal communities do not undergo refraction in one direction, ie in the direction of the vertical crystalline axis
 prakashkeey drushti se aise crystalon ko ekakshiya kaha jaataa he
 There is no refraction in two directions in Vishalambaksha, Ekantaksha and Trinataksha crystals
 at: aise crystalon ko prakaashat: dwi-aksheeya kehete hai
 These two directions, called optical axes, do not match the crystal structural axes, but they lie in a plane with maximum and minimum velocity directions
 adhiktam or nunatam vegavaali dishaao main se ek prakaashiya aksh ke laghukon ko tathaa duusari brihadkon ko ardhit karti he
 Some crystals are inherently fluorescent
 ye pisane par, khurachne par, yaa malane par, yaa laal taap se neeche tak garam karne par andhere main prakaash phekate hai
 These crystals, which begin to glow in darkness upon invagination in invisible radiation, such as ultraviolet light or x rays, or cathode rays, are called fluorescent
 yadi vikiran kaa strot hataane ke baad bhi crystal main chamak bani rahati he, to use sfurdipt crystal kehete hai
 Some crystals, which have higher atomic weight elements, are radioactive
 inkaa badi teji se tathaa ek samgati se vighatan hota rahata he
 Elements, such as radium, uranium, thorium, decompose to refract into helium and lead and emit energy in the form of radiation, which can be conveniently detected by an instrument called the Geiger counter
 vah taap jisapar bhinn bhinn crystal pighalate hai, vistrut seemaa main vichrata hai
 Some crystals are fusible in a flame of flame and some do not melt in it
 aapekshik galaniyata chah khanijon kii galaniyata-maapak ke aadhaar par nishchit kii ja sakati he
 The liquids of these minerals range from 525 ° c to 1,400 ° C, while the heat of a good blow flame goes up to 1,500 ° C
 kuch crystalon main taap parivartan karne par unke vibhinn bhaagon main ek hi saath dhan or rin vidyut utpann ho jaati he
 Even under the influence of compression, money and debt are produced in different layers of the crystal
 inamen se pratham ghatana ko tapavidyut tathaa duusari ghatana ko dabavidyut kehete hai
 It is very interesting that this phenomenon is found only in crystals that fall into symmetry classes that do not have symmetry centers
 quatrge or tourmaileen iske saamaanya udhaaharan he
 In modern times, pressurized crystals are used in radio and acoustics
 ve crystal, jinamein loha hota he, saamanyat: chumbakeey hote hai, kuch bina lohe vaale crystal bhi alp yaa mand chumbakeey hote hai
 Of these, only magnetite and pirotite are attracted by a simple placenta or penal magnet
 inke atirikt bahut se aise crystal hai, jo vidyut chumbak dwaara aakarshith kiye jate hai
 Apart from these, there are many, which are attracted in different order by electromagnet, thus it becomes easy to separate them from each other
 jab ek rasinic padaarth crystal kaa rup dhaaran karata he, tab parmaanu, jisase anu banate hai, tathaa anu ek nishchit praturup main vyavasthit rahete hai
 The crystal structure is usually the identity of the compound
