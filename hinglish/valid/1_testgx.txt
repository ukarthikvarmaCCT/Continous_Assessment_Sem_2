 Now it will bear the responsibility of Grihalakshmi, so her hands are made yellow
 uske mata-pita ne laad-pyaar se paala, uske haathon main koi kathor kattarvy nahin saunpa
 Now he has to prepare his hands to take on many responsibilities of the new creation, so he should be a symbol of Pitavarna mangalik-lakshmi - creative
 pile haath karte hue kanya parivaar ke log us balika ko yahi maun shikshan dete hai ki use aage srijan shakti ke rup main prakat hona he or iske liye in komal haathon ko adhik uttaradaayi, majboot or mangalik bananaa he
 Give both the palms in front of the girl

51 Kanyadaan means the transfer of the responsibilities of the parents over the groom, over the in-laws
 ab tak mata-pita kanya ke bharan-poshan, vikaas, suraksha, sukh-shaanti, anand-ullas aadi kaa prabandh karte the, ab vah prabandh var or uske kutumbiyon ko karnaa hoga
 The girl should not be able to go to the new house and experience the blissfulness, she should not feel lack of affection, cooperation, harmony, she has to take full care of it
 kanyadan sweekaar karte samay-panigrahan kii jimmedaari sweekaar karte samay, var tathaa uske abhibhavakon ko yah baat bhalee prakaar anubhav kar leni chahie ki unhen us uttardaayitv ko puri jimmedaari ke saath nibaahana he
 Kanyadaan does not mean that just as a property is sold or donated to someone, similarly, the girl is also considered as an asset and is given to someone else to use
 har manushya kii ek swatantra satta evam sthiti he
 No human can sell or donate to any human being
 phir chaahe vah pita hi kyon na ho
 The independent existence and right of a person cannot be denied, nor can he be challenged
 ladki ho yaa ladkaa abhibhavakon ko yah adhikaar nahin ki ve unhen bechein yaa daan karen
 If you do this, the fact of the child's independent personality will be denied
 vivaah ubhaypaksheeya samjhauta he, jise var or vadhoo donon hi puri eemaandaaree or nishtha ke saath nirvaah kar safal banaate hai
 If one views someone as a property bought or sold and is treated or treated as animal ownership, it would be to violate the fundamental rights of humanity
 kanyadan kaa yah taatpary kadaapi nahin, uskaa prayojan itnaa hi he ki kanya ke abhibhavak balika ke jivan ko suvyavasthit, suviksit evam sukh-shantimay banane kii jimmedaari ko var tathaa uske abhibhavakon par chhodte hai, jise unhen manoyogpuwork nibaahana chahie
 Upon reaching a foreign home, an inexperienced, young girl who has a raw age has to go through a panicky mood
 isliye is aarmabhik sandhivela main to vishesh rup se var paksh waalon ko yah prayaas karnaa chahie ki har drushti se vadhoo ko adhik sneh, sahyog miltaa rahe
 Even those on the Virgo side should not think that they have given yellow hands to the girl, have donated, now they do not have to do anything or think
 unhen bhi ladki ke bhavishya ko ujjwal banane main yogadan dete rahanaa he
 Action and Emotion- By making the girl's hand yellow with turmeric, the parents speak with determination in their hand, keeping the girl's hand, money and flowers of secret donation and handing those hands to the groom's hands
 vah in haathon ko gambhirtha or jimmedaari ke saath apane haathon ko pakadakar sweekaar-shirodharya karata he
 Realize that while entrusting the bride to the groom, her parents entrust their total authority
 kanya ke kul gotra ab pitru parampara se nahin, pati parampara ke anusaar honge
 Devotees are being empowered to make this emotional effort to the girl and to make her husband accept or fulfill her
 is bhaavana ke saath kanyadan kaa sankalp bolaa jaae
 When the resolution is complete, hand over the girl's hand to the groom

 kanyadan ke samay kuch anshdaan dene kii pratha he
 Some money is given at the time of donating, hiding in the dough
 dahej kaa yahi swaroop he
 While leaving the child's house, her parents give some money as a gift to come to work in case of any need, but it is secret
 abhibhavak or kanya ke bich kaa yah nijee uphaar he
 There is no need for others to know or ask about it
 dahej ke rup main kya diya janaa chahie, is sambandh main sasuraal waalon ko kehane yaa poochne kaa koi adhikaar nahin
 Neither is its performance required, because what the poor and rich give according to their situation should not become a matter of discussion, blasphemy should not be associated with it
 ek-duusare kaa anukaran karne lagen, pratisparddha par utar aaen, to isse anarth hi hoga
 There will be undue pressure on the Virgo side and if the groom does not get more, he will start to feel unhappy
 isliye kanyadan ke saath kuch dhandaan kaa vidhaan to he, par durrdashi rishiyon ne logon kii swatharparata evam dushtataa kii sambhaavna ko dhyaan main rakhte hue yah niyam bana diya he ki jo kuch bhi dahej diya jaae, vah sarvatha gupt ho, us par kisi ko charchaa karne kaa adhikaar na ho
 Normally one rupee in flour is sufficient for this dowry symbol

 Cow is a symbol of purity and altruism
 kanya paksh var ko aisa daan den, jo unhen pavitrataa or parmarth kii prerana dene vaala ho
 If possible, cow can be donated on the occasion of Kanyadaan
 vah kanya ke va uske parivaar ke logon ke swasthya kii drushti se upyukt bhi he
 In today's situation if giving or taking cows is inconvenient, then the donkey practice can be kept alive by paying some money for it
 kriya or bhaavana- kanyadan karne vaale haath main saamagree len
 Feel that in order to make happy life of bride and groom's future life, they are giving the best charity faithfully

27 After the kanyadaan-godan, the Kanyadaata makes a humble appeal of dignity to the groom in witness of the seven men and the Dev Shakti

 The responsibility of the girl is entrusted to the groom
 rishiyon dwaara nidharrit anushaasan vishesh lakshya ke liye hai
 By taking the authority, do not forget that Mayarda and behave arbitrarily
 dharm, arth or kaam kii disha main rishi pranit mayarda kaa ulanghan adhikaar ke nashe main na kiya jaae
 It is requested, which the groom happily accepts
 kanyadan karne vaale apane haath main jal, pushp, akshat len
 Feel that you are giving mayard to the groom
 var mayarda sweekaar karen, uske paalan ke liye dev shaktiyon ke sahyog kii kaamana kare

 As if holding each other and supporting
 kanyadan kii tarah yah var-daan kii kriya to nahin hoti, phir bhi us avasar par var kii bhaavana bhi thik waisi honi chahie, jaisi ki kanya ko apana haath saunpte samay hoti he
 The groom should also feel that he has made this bride the center of his personality, his desire, aspiration and conduct of activities and also handed over his hand
 donon ek duusare ko aage badhaane ke liye ek duusare kaa haath jab bhavanapurvak samaaj ke sammukh pakad len, to samajhnaa chahie ki vivaah kaa prayojan puraa ho gaya
 With the mantra written below, the girl should extend her hand towards the groom, the groom should hold him with his thumb

 Now both are fully tied up with each other
 granthibandhan main dhan, pushp, durva, haridra or akshat yah paanch chijen bhi bandhate hai
 Money is kept because no one will have the right over the money
 jo kamai yaa sampatti hogi, us par donon kii sahmati se yojana evam vyavastha banegi
 Durva means the never-ending love spirit
 durva kaa jivan tatva nasht nahin hota, suukh jane par bhi vah pani daalane par hari ho jaati he
 In the same way, the love and affinity of each other remain in each other's mind
 chandra-chakor kii tarah ek-duusare par apane ko nyochhavar karte rahen
 Believe your pain less and partner's pain increase, take care of partner's happiness more than your happiness

 Haridra means- Arogya, try to develop each other's physical, mental health
 aisa vyavhaar na karen, jisase saathi kaa swasthya kharaab hota ho yaa maansik udvaig paidaa hota ho
 Akshata, reminds us of collective-social miscellaneous responsibilities

 Taking proper care of them all, taking care of them all is a joint duty of the joint husband and wife
 aisa na ho ki ek-duusare ko to prem karen, par parivaar ke logon kii upeksha karne lagen
 Similarly, the responsibility of serving the public mind outside the family also rests on every emotional person
 aisa na ho ki do main se koi kisi ko apane vyaktigat swaarth sahyog tak hi simit kar le, use samaaj seva kii suvidha na de
 Resist the time and money taken in this direction
 akshat isi kaa sanket karata he ki aap donon ek-duusare ke liye hi nahin bane hai, varan samajaseva kaa vrath evam uttardaayitv bhi aap logon ke granthibandhan main ek mahatvapunar lakshya ke rup main vidyaman he
 Flower means to keep laughing and blossoming
 ek-duusare ko sugandhit banane ke liye yash failaane or prashansa karne ke liye tatpar rahen
 No one insults or insults anyone else
 is prakaar durva, pushp, haridra, akshat or paisa in paanchon ko rakhkar donon kaa granthibandhan kiya jaataa he or yah aashaa kii jaati he ki ve jin lakshyon ke saath aapas main bandhe hai, unhen aaajeevan nirantar samaran rakhe rahenge

1 After the atonement sacrifice, a mixed sequence of Lajahom and Yagyagni revolves
 lajahome ke liye kanya kaa bhai ek thali main khil lekar peeche khadaa ho
 Give one of your mutts to your sister
 kanya use var ko saunp de
 The groom should perform Havan with the Ahuti mantra
 is prakaar teen baar kiya jaae
 The girl should give the Kheel given by her brother to her husband thrice, and in the Havan, she should do it three times
 lajahome main bhai ke ghar se ann bahin ko miltaa he, use vah apane pati ko saunp detii he
 She says i have received something from my father's house for my personal use, but i do not keep it separately, i hand it to you
 algaav yaa chhipav kaa bhav koi man main na aae, isliye jis prakaar pati kuch kamai karata he, to patni ko saunpta he, usee prakaar patni bhi apni uplabdhiyon ko pati ke haath main saunpti he
 The husband thinks, we will do our work with whatever we earn from our hands and feet, why should we become indebted to someone by eating generously given grants without doing any labor
 isliye pati us laja ko apane khaane ke liye nahin rakh letaa, varan yajna main home detaa he
 For public welfare, it makes the material airy and disperses it in the atmosphere of the world
 is kriya main yahan mahaan maanviya adarsh sannihit he ki muft kaa maal yaa to sweekaar hi na kiya jaay yaa mili bhi to use lokhit main kharch kar diya jaae
 People should live on their own sweat earnings
 mritak bhoj ke peeche bhi yahi adarshavadita thi ki pita ke dwaara uttaradhikaar main mili hue dhan ko ladke apane kaam main nahin lete the, varan samajasevi brahmanon ke nirvaah main yaa anya punyakaryon main kharch kar daalate the
 The same is true with regard to dowry
 pita ke grih se udaartapuwork mila, so unki bhaavana saraahneey he, par aapaki bhi to kuch bhaavana honi chahie
 It is natural for an earning man to have a free account while eating free goods
 uskaa yah sochna thik hi he ki bina parishram kaa dhan, vah bhi daan kii udaar bhaavana se diya hua use pachega nahin, isliye uphaar ko jan mangal ke kaayr main, parmarth yajna main aahuti kar dena hi uchit he
 For this purpose, he puts Laja given by the wife's brother in the Yajna work
 dahej kaa thik upyog yahi he, pratha bhi he ki vivaah ke avasar par var paksh kii ore se bahut sa daan-punya kiya jaataa he
 Whatever is good, donate it to everyone
 vivaah ke samay hi nahin, anya avasaron par bhi yadi kabhi kisi se kuch aisa hi bina parishram kaa uphaar mili, to uske sambandh main ek niti rahani chahie ki muft kaa maal khaakar ham paralok ke rini na banenge, varan aise anudaan ko parmarth main lagaakar us udaar parampara ko apane main na rokkar aage jan kalyaan ke liye badha denge
 Where there is a difference of ground and sky between the liberal spirit of Indian culture and where today's money lusts demand vampiric dowry which pierces the bowels of the female side
 jisane apane hriday kaa, aatma kaa tukdaa kanya de di, unke prati var paksh kaa rome-rome kritagya hona chahie or yah sochna chahie ki is alokik uphaar ke badale main kis prakaar apni shraddha-sadbhaavna vyakt karen
 Instead of this, when the girl's side is suppressed and it is planned to torture and suck her in various ways, it should be understood that Indian traditions are absolutely nauseated
 dharm ke sthaan par adharm, devatv ke sthaan par asurataa kaa samrajya chaa gaya
 Lajahom defies the petty beliefs of the present period and inspires the right approach to dowry
 agni kii pati-patani parikrama karen
 Walk from left to right
 pehali chaar parikramaon main kanya aage rahe or var peeche
 After four revolutions, the boy is ahead and the girl is behind
 parikrama ke samay parikrama mantra bolaa jaae tathaa har parikrama puri hone par ek-ek aahuti var-vadhoo gayatri mantra se karte chalem, iskaa tatpayar he- ghar-parivaar ke kaaryon main ladki kaa netritv rahegaa, uske paraamarsh ko mahatva diya jayega, var uskaa anusaran karegaa, kyonki un kaamon kaa nari ko anubhav adhik hota he
 The groom leads the outside work and the woman follows him, because the groom has more experience in professional fields
 jisamen jis disha kii jaankaree kam ho, duusare main uski jaankaree badhaakar apane samatuly banane main prayatansheel rahen
 Women are ahead in the field of emotion, men in the field of action
 donon paksh apane-apane sthaan par mahatvapurn hai
 Overall, woman's fame, position, pride and weight are large
 isliye use chaar parikrama karne or nar ko teen parikrama karne kaa avasar diya jaataa he
 In the election of Gaurav, 4 votes go to the girl and 3 votes to the groom
 isliye sadaa nar se pehla sthaan nari ko mila he
 In pairs of Sitaram, Radheshyam, Lakshminarayana, Umamahesh etc
 the name of the woman is first, the male behind
 laja home or parikrama kaa mila-jula kram chalata he
 After the ceremony, the bride and groom dedicate a sacrifice to the Gayatri Mantra
 ab mantra ke saath parikrama karen
 Brides go forward, groom go backward
 ek parikrama puri hone par lajahome kii ek aahuti karen
 Perform a second circumambulation by speaking the mantra as before
 isi prakaar lajahome kii duusari aahuti karke teesri parikrama tathaa teesri aahuti karke chauthi parikrama karen
 After this, giving the sacrifice of Gayatri Mantra, three parikramas should be carried forward by the bride while speaking the parikrama mantra
 aahuti ke saath bhaavana karen ki baahar yagyeey urja tathaa antahkaran main yagyeey bhaavana tivratar ho rahi he
 Realize with circumambulation that by taking the yagya discipline as the center, witnessing the yagnagni and resolving to deliver the ideal couple

3 disha or preranabhanwaren phir lene ke uparant saptapadi kii jaati he
 Seven times, the bride and groom step together step by step like military soldiers
 saat chaaval kii dheri yaa kalava bandhe hue sakore rakh diye jate hai, in lakshya-chihnon ko pair lagaate hue donon ek-ek kadam aage badhate hai, ruk jate hai or phir aglaa kadam badhaate hai
 In this way, seven steps are taken
 prayek kadam ke saath ek-ek mantra bolaa jaataa he
 The first step is taken for food, the second for strength, the third for wealth, the fourth for happiness, the fifth for family, the sixth for rites and the seventh for friendship
 vivaah hone ke uparant pati-patani ko milakar saat kyrkram apnaane padate hai
 Both of them should have a fair and just contribution, its outline is laid down in Saptapadi
 pratham kadam ann vruddhi ke liye he
 Diet should be healthy, gourmetness should not find any place in the house
 rasoi main jo bane, vah aisa ho ki swasthya raksha kaa prayojan puraa kare, bhale hi vah swaadisht na ho
 The successful householder is the one who can produce food, preserve food, make good use of food
 adhik pakaa lenaa, juuthan chhodana, batarn khule rakhkar ann kii chuhon se babardi karana, michar-masala kii bharmaar use tamoguni bana dena, swatchta kaa dhyaan na rakhana, aadi baton se aahaar par bahut kharch karte hue bhi swasthya nasht hota he, isliye daampaty jivan kaa uttardaayitv yah he ki aahaar kii sattviktaa kaa samuchit dhyaan rakhaa jaae
 The second step is to increase physical and mental strength
 vyaayaam, parishram, uchit evam niyamit aahaar-vihaar se sharir kaa bal sthir rahata he
 Study and discussion boost morale
 jin prayatanon se donon prakaar ke bal badhen, donon adhik samarth, swasth evam shashakt bane-uskaa upaay sochate rahanaa chahie
 The third step is for the increase of wealth
 arth vyavastha bajet banaakar chalaai jaae
 Kani Kauri should not be destroyed in waste
 uchit kaaryon main kanjusee na kii jaae- fishan, vyasan, shekhikhori aadi ke liye paisa kharch na karke use paariwarik unnati ke liye sanbhaalkar, bachaakar rakhaa jaae
 Both husband and wife should try to earn
 purush baahar jaakar krishi, vyavsaay, naukari aadi karte hai, to striyaan silaai, dhulaai, safai aadi karke is tarah kii kamai karti hai
 As much as care is taken on procurement, keeping the house economy in mind while keeping the expenses limits is the essential duty of married life
 chauthaa kadam sukh kii vruddhi ke liye he
 Such an atmosphere of relaxation, entertainment, humor, humor and humor should be kept so that even in poverty, the richness should be enjoyed
 donon prasannchitt rahen
 Get into the habit of smiling, cut out laughing life
 chitt ko halakaa rakhen, 'santoshi sadaa sukhi' kii niti apnaayen
 The fifth step is family rearing
 chote bade sabhi ke saath samuchit vyavhaar rakhaa jaae
 Dependent animals and servants should also be considered as a family, do not be negligent in always thinking and doing all these dependents for proper care, safety, progress and happiness
 chatha kadam ritucharya kaa he
 Baby production is a natural instinct, so it is also a place in married life, but in that regard, Mayardas should be followed with full rigor and vigilance, because both the health is expected to be annihilated due to incontinence, even at home
 Brahmacharya should be properly followed
 donon ek duusare kaa bhi sahyogi mitra kii drushti se dekhen, kaamuktha ke sarvanashi prasangon ko jitna sambhav ho, dur rakhaa jaae
 Before producing a child, consider a thousand times whether your situation is worthy of making your child cultured
 us maryaada main santaan utpann karne kii jimmedaari vahan karen
 The seventh step is to keep the friendship stable and increase
 donon is baat par baariki se vichaar karte rahen ki unki ore se koi truti to nahin barti ja rahi he, jiske kaaran saathi ko rusht yaa asantusht hone kaa avasar aae
 Even if the other side is committing some mistake, it should be answered not with harshness, consternation, but with gentleness, with kindness, so that the partner will be inspired to automatically improve by suppressing the greatness
 baahar ke logon ke saath, dushton ke saath dushtataa kii niti kisi had tak apanaai ja sakati he, par atmiyajanon kaa hriday jeetne ke liye udaartaa, seva, saujany, kshamaa jaise shastr kii kaam main laaye jane chahie
 Taking seven steps in the Saptapadi, these seven sutras have to be done Hridayangam
 in aadarshon or siddhanton ko yadi pati-patni dwaara apana liya jaae or usee maarg par chalane ke liye kadam se kadam badhaate hue agrasar hone kii thaan lee jaae, to daampaty jivan kii safalataa main koi sandeh hi nahin rah jaataa
 Stand Kriya and Bhavnavar-bride
 prayek kadam badhaane se pehle dev shaktiyon kii sakshi kaa mantra bolaa jaataa he, us samay var-vadhoo haath jodakar dhyaan karen
 After that, take the first step on speaking the mantra to increase the step
 isi prakaar ek-ek karke saat kadam badhaaye jaaen
 It is to be realized that for the planned and progressive life, Devs are committed to witnessing, the combined benefit of Sankalp and Dev Grace will continue to be available throughout life

 Antioxidants or antibodies are compounds that are mixed with small amounts of other substances to inhibit their reaction with the oxygen of the atmosphere
 in yogicon ko oxikaran nirodhak tathaa sthayeekari bhi kehete hai tathaa sthayeekari bhi kehete hai
 That is, anti-oxidants are molecules that protect other molecules from oxidation or slow down the oxidation process of other molecules
 oxikaran ek prakaar kii rasinic kriya he jiske dwaara kisi padaarth se electron yaa hydrogen oxikaarak agent ko sthanantarit ho jate hai
 Antioxidants are used in medical science and industry
 petrol main pratioxikaarak milaae jate hai
 These antioxidants do not allow the formation of viscosity-causing substances that are harmful to the internal combustion engine
 praayah pratisthapit phenol evam fenilanediamine ke vyutpann is kaam ke liye prayukt hote hai
 Many compounds are automatically oxidized by oxygen in the air when they are kept open
 is rasinic kriya ke falswaroop un padaartho main kuch avaanchhneeya gundharm aa jate hai, jo unako saadhaaran upyog ke liye anupyukt kar dete hai
 Many such changes are realized by ordinary senses
 at: swat: oxikaran dwaara padaartho ke bighad jane tathaa adhik dinon tak surakshit rakhane kaa gyaan manushya ko bahut dinon se tha yadhyapi 'swat: oxikaran' kii kriya kaa purna gyaan kaaphi baad main ho paaya
 The process of automatic oxidation takes place in four terms: praarambhik pad jo bahut hi mand gati se ghatit hota he, Accelerating speed respectively, lagbhag sthaayee gati tathaa Last loss-oriented motion
 pratham pad tathaa duusare pad kii mand gati tak kii jo avadhi hoti he use praren avadhi kehete hai or yah is baat ko pradarshit karata he
 This confirms the oxidation reaction process based on the chain reaction
 swat: oxikaran prakriya main shrunkhalaavahak kaa kaam muktamulak karte hai jo bahut hi sakriy hote hai
 They are formed by breakdown of the weakest carbon – hydrogen bond in the molecule that is self oxidized
 at: is prakaar ke padaarth main aasaani se nikal janevaale ek hydrogen parmaanu kii upasthiti aavashyak he
 In addition, it should also have a binary with which the free radical can be combined
 yadhyapi oxikaran abhikriyaayein jivan ke liye ati mahatvapoornan hai, ve hanikaarak bhi ho sakati hai
 Oxidation reactions can produce free radicals, which initiate chain reactions that damage cells
 pratioxikaarak padaarth swayan in mukt mulkon se oxikrut ho jate hai jisase shrunkhlaa abhikriya ko todane main madad milti he
 Taxes inhibit these chain reactions that occur on cells
 atev praayah antioxident ridusing agents hote hai, jaise thaol, escorbic amla yaa poliphinol aadi
 a complex system of manufacture and collection of various types of antioxidants is found in plants and animals
 inamen glutathion,, vitamin-si, vitamin-i, anzime aadi aate hai
 Inadequate amounts of antioxidants or the destruction of antioxidant enzymes cause oxidative stress that can cause damage or death of cells
 aisa samajha ja rahaa he ki oxikar tanaav hi anekon rogon kaa kaaran he
 Therefore, in pharmacology, antibiotics are intensively studied, especially for trauma and neurodegenerative diseases
 oxikar tanaav rogon kaa kaaran bhi he or parinaam bhi
 Antioxidants are used extensively as a complementary food

 There are three forms of this institution: isaki utpatti samajhane ke liye europe kii tatkaaleen paristhiti ko dhyaan main rakhana aavashyak he
 Officials of the Catholic religion were alert from the very beginning of the proper formulation of their religious beliefs and were able to protect them for centuries by explaining the propagators of misleading doctrines and excluding them from the religion as necessary
 chauthi shatabdi i
 main katholic dharm ko roman samrajya kii ore se manyata mili; baad main vah europe ke adhikansh deshon main bhi rajdharm ke rup main sweekrut hone laga
 Thus, rebellion against the Catholic religion was considered treason
 falswaroop sarkaar katholic dharmavirohi siddhanton kaa prachaar karanevaalon ko nirvaasan, sampatti kii jabti aadi dand diya karti thi
 In the 12th century, social and political unrest began to spread due to the propagation of certain communities, in which the sect called Albigansus was the preacher in the southern parts of France
 un logon kii dharna thi ki samast bhautik jagat kisi dusht purush kii sristi he; maanav sharir bhi dooshit he isliye aatmahatya uchit kintu vivaah bura he kyonki vah shaareerik jivan ko banaae rakhane kaa saadhan he
 Thus, the 'perfect' people of this community followed celibacy, but used to teach their ordinary followers that adultery is better than marriage if one cannot maintain complete restraint

 Towards the end of AD, the institution of Enquisition was established and later it spread to almost all Christian countries

 The accused were requested to abandon their misleading doctrine and repent
 jo log iske liye taiyaar nahin hote the, unako prandand dilaane ke liye sarkaar ke haath saunpa jaataa tha
 According to the barbaric practice of that time, the accused was also tortured by the accused
 abhiyoktaaon ke naam gupt rakhe jate the tathaa apashchattapi doshiyon ko jite ji jala diya jaataa tha
 For these reasons, historians have strongly condemned the Enquisition
 isaki sthapana san 1478 i
 main raja ke anurodh par is uddeshy se hui thi ki gupt musalamaanon tathaa yahudiyon kaa pataa lagaaya jaae
 The thing is that for some seven centuries, Muslim dominance over some regions of Spain and many Christians were predominantly Muslim
 duusari ore, raja ne spain ke yahudiyon ko yah aadesh diya ki isai bano athwa desh chhod do
 In this situation there was doubt about the new Christians of Spain whether they are Muslims or Jews inside

 The weak range of orally active phenoxyethylphenicillin with a narrow range of curable diseases or the spectrum of activity of penicillin led to the discovery of a homologous form of penicillin, to treat a wider range of infections
 6-apie ke algaav, penicillin ke centre ne benzilpenicillin main vibhinn sudhaaron ke saath semisynthetic penicillinon ko taiyaar karne kii anumati di
 The first major development was ampicillin, which provided a wider range of activities than all the original penicillins
 Further development led to the production of beta-lactamase-resistant penicillin, including flucloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and methicillin

 Sultan Ali Khan was a medium-age ex-wrestler, who lived in a small town in Haryana
 akaash oberoi ek "pro tech-down" lig kaa maalik rahata he
 He wants to hire an Indian wrestler to make it very famous
 iske liye vah sultan se baat karata he, lekin sultan saaf saaf manaa kar detaa he
 Akash now talks to his friend Govind to find out the reason for leaving his wrestling
 iske baad govind use aath saal pehle kii kahani bataata he, jab sultan ko arafa se pyaar ho jaataa he
 But Arfa refuses him
 sultan iske baad kai maheene tak bahut mehnat karata he or pahalwani ke ek muqaabale main hissaa letaa he
 Arfa and she get married soon after this competition wins and he becomes a national level wrestler
 kuch samay baad arafa maan banane vaali hoti he or pahalwani chhod detii he
 On the day his baby is about to be born, he goes to another competition and when he comes back, he learns that his child has died due to lack of blood
 uskaa khun o+ hota he, jo sultan kaa bhi hota he
 But due to his absence no other blood donor is found
 is kaaran arafa use hi us bachche ke marane kaa kaaran sochati he
 After this, the Sultan starts depositing money to build a blood bank there alone
 is baat kaa pataa chalate hi akaash sultan ko bolta he ki yadi vah lig main hissaa le letaa he to use uskaa sapana puraa karne ke liye puure paise mil jaayenge
 The Sultan agrees and moves to Delhi with him
 lekin tab tak uskaa sharir besanga or motaa rahata he
 For this reason, he leaves her to Fateh Singh, where he practices for a few weeks
 puri tarah sehatmand hone ke baad pehle hi muqaabale main sultan jeet jaataa he
 But in the semi-finals, he gets hurt very badly and gets hospitalized
 doctor akaash ko kehete hai ki jab tak vah puri tarah thik nahin ho jaataa, use ladaai nahin kerani chahie
 After this Arfa comes to the hospital and asks him to complete this work
 sultan dard ke baad bhi is pratiyogita ko jeet jaataa he or sultan or arafa phir se ek ho jate hai
 The Sultan then builds a blood bank with his prize money
 iske kuch varshon ke baad arafa ek bacchee ko janm detii he
 The project was revealed on youtube on June 2015

 The removal of surface or subsurface water in an area in a natural or artificial way is called drainage
 krishi bhoomi ke utpaadan ko sudhaarney yaa pani kii aapurti ke prabandhan ke liye jal nikasi kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 The drains and drainage systems of the ancient Indus civilization, which developed throughout the civilization and continued to be used in cities, are much more advanced than any contemporary urban locations found in the Middle East and in modern-day Pakistan and India
 Some areas were more effective than others
 hadappa or mohanjo-dado ke pramukh shaharon ke sabhi gharon main pani or naaliyon kii suvidhaayen thi
 Wastewater was drained through covered drains, which remained along major lanes
 1881 ke houseold cychlopedia se This process is best done in the spring or summer, when the ground is dry
 kshetra ke prayek hisse main mukhya naalee banaai jaani chahie jahaan purv main cross cat yaa khuli hui naalee kii aavashyaktaa thi; inaki ausat gaharaai chaar feet honi chahie
 This makes them completely safe from the damage caused by mowing by horses or cattle and being so far away from the small drains that they scrub them closely
 har sthiti main, agar sambhav ho sake to, mukhya naaliyon ke liye pipe turf adhik behatar hai
 If there is good hard soil, one row of pipe turf, if sandy, double row of pipe turf should be given
 yadi pipe turf aasaani se na mili, to avbhumi majboot, kathor mitti hone par ek acchhee veg dren adhik behatar vikalp he; lekin avbhumi keval maamuli rup se aisi hai, to thorn dren, jiske neeche jod hon, phir bhi behatar sabit hogi; or yadi avbhumi bahut retili he to pipon ke alaava kisi or vidhi dwaara khet main sataha ke neeche naaliyaan banane kaa prayaas karnaa vyarth he
 It is necessary to mention here that the size of the main drain should be determined according to the length and slope of the flow and the amount of water flowing into it
 yadhyapi mukhya naaliyon kaa bada hona tathaa adhik sankhya main hona sadaiv surakshit he, kintu laagat ke kaaran aisa shaayad hi kabhi ho paata he
 After making the main drains, if the dunes in the east are not less than 15 feet wide, then make small drains in each bed of the field
 But if this is the case, first level the dunes and make drains in the best direction and at the required distance
 If the water rises well into the bottom of the drains, they should be dug three feet deep and by doing so the field will dry out easily, although they were to be dug separately twenty-five to thirty feet; But if the water does not climb well into the bottom of the drains, a depth of two feet for the pipe drain and two and a half feet for the wedge drain is sufficient
 agar khet ko pehle se samtal kiya gaya ho to kisi bhi haalat main ve or khokhli nahin honi chahie
 However, in this instance, because the top of the drain is submerged in the water, the surface water rises mainly, the drains will need to be built close to each other - such as fifteen to twenty feet
 yadi tile pandraa feet se adhik chaude hai, chaahe ve kitne bhi chaude yaa aniyamit hon, naalee kii sarvottam disha ke rup main hameshaa puraani kyaariyon kii lakiron kaa anusaran karen; or jahaan adhik sankhya main tile ikatthe hon, pipe dren ke liye bees se choubees inch tathaa veg dren ke liye choubees se tees inch kii gaharaai paryaapt hogi
 Special care must be taken when connecting the small and main drains, so that water can get an obstructed and good gradient from the main drains
 jab naaliyon kaa kaam khatm ho jaataa he to tilon ko hal dwaara tod diya jaataa he or jahaan purv main ve atyadhik oonche the, ek doosraa prayaas kiya ja saktaa he, kintu yah behatar hoga ki tilon ko bahut adhik samtal naa kiya jaae, taaki ve thoda bahut apni puraani avasthaa main rah saken, jahaan naaliyaan hai vahaan maidan ke nimnatam str par hone ke kaaran sataha kaa pani naaliyon main upar tak ikaitha hota he or uname dub kar swatantra rup se bahata he
 After doing this in the field, make new mounds across small drains, keep them ten feet wide and then plow the field in the same way as run on dry land
 jal nikasi kii uparokt vidhi se yah spasht he ki khet main mukhya naaliyon kii sankhya, choti naaliyon ke bich aapas kii duuri or maidan par tay kii jane vaali duuri ke anusaar kharch main vividhta hogi
 There are many benefits of creating a drain below the surface, which not only saves the cost of making huge amount of water tunnel annually, cross cutting etc
 but also the land can be conveniently plowed and sown in summer and winter, which That is quite impractical without it; Every variety of crops sown through holes such as beans, potatoes, turnips, etc
 can be cultivated successfully and each variety of green and white crops is less likely to spoil in wet and unpleasant climates
 jahaan kahin bhi pani kaa ek jal strot kisi vishesh sthaan se prakat ho to is musiibat se chhutkaaraa paane kaa sabase surakshit va kargar tarika sataha se neeche aise gaddhon kii khudaai karnaa he jisame ki girane vaala pani ikaitha kiya ja sake or jisame bauchhaar yaa jal strot se nikalne vaali pani kii maatra samaa sake
 After determining the amount of water released, noting the required levels, and clearing the estuary or water-logging route, begin the evacuation near that major estuary and work until it reaches the mouth of the shower, Which will probably yield the required item
 lekin agar yah puri tarah se khatm na ho to mukhya naalee main utani sankhya main shakhaaen daalen jitani pani ko bich main rokane ke liye aavashyak hon or is prakaar shaayad hi niraashaa kaa anubhav hoga
 Drains should rarely be less than three feet deep, twenty or twenty four inches full of stone or wood to make them more useful according to the circumstances
 Previously stated material is best, but in many places these things are not found in sufficient quantity; Therefore the latter material should be resorted to, although it is not more functional or durable
 gaddhon ko khudaai ke saath-saath tivrata se bharna atyant mahatvapurn he kyonki, agar lambey samay tak yah khulaa rah jaae to na keval aas paas kii mitti iske andar giregi balki iske kinare bhi kshatigrast yaa aniyamit ho sakate hai jo baad main puri tarah se thik nahin kiye ja sakate
 sataha kii mitti ke ghulne milane se bachane ke liye saamagree ke upar puaal yaa ghaas yukt mitti daal deni chahie or jahaan bharaav ke liye lakdi kaa prayog kiya gaya ho, vahaan or adhik dhyaan dene kii aavashyaktaa he anyathaa prastaavit sudhaar aasaani se niraashajanak ho sakate hai
 The drainage pit method is very effective if executed carefully
 jab pani ke strot kii uplabdhta ke bare main paryaapt jaankaree milti he, jo ki ek barame kii sahaayta se boring karke aasaani se pataa kii ja sakati he, us sthaan par ek aise aakaar kaa gaddha banaaen jahaan ek vyakti apni seemaa ke bheetar kaam kar sake
 Dig this pit as deep as the source of the water that comes out; And when this depth is attained, which is revealed by the release of water, fill the pit with large stones and take the water through a strong drain to the nearest pit or mouth from where it is carried to the nearest river
 can go
 aadhunik jal nikasi vyavastha main giotextile filter hote hai jo mitti ke baarik kanon ko khud main se guzarane se rokte tathaa naaliyon ko band hone se bachaate hai
 Geotextiles are synthetic fabrics that have been specifically manufactured for civil and environmental engineering applications
 giotextile is tarah se dizin kiye gaye hai ki ye mitti ke baarik kanon ko roak lete hai kintu pani ko guzarane dete hai
 In a typical drainage system they will be laid in a narrow pit which will then be filled with thick granular material: gravel, sea shell, stone or rocks
 The geotextile is then folded on top of the stone and the pit is then filled with soil
 bhoojal giotextile se risataa he or pathar ke andar se muhane kii ore pravaahit hota he
 In high groundwater conditions, a perforated plastic pipe is placed along the drain base to increase the amount of water transported to the drain
 harith naalee Enzyme-based methods can be a safer alternative than chemical means of cleaning the drain and do not harm the environment
 ye saadhan bacteria yaa anzimon kaa prayog karte hai, jo prakritik rup se jaivik apshisht, jaise naaliyon main aksar funsane vaale baalo yaa apshisht khaadya padaarthon, par palate hai
 These small organisms then digest waste and produce beneficial bacteria and enzymes throughout the septic system
 vastav main, naalee saafe karne vaale anzimon kaa prayog mul rup se septic tinkon or mel ko saafe karne main kiya jaataa tha
 Enzyme-based drain cleaners are better for the environment, as they prevent hazardous chemicals from seeping into the soil and spreading into the water
 
 Alternatively, a plastic drainage system prepared from HDPE / HDPE called smartditch, and often containing filters made of geotextile, coconut fiber, and patchwork, may be considered

 Dry areas are cultivated by irrigation and no one would consider the need for drainage
 haalanki, sinchai ke pani main hameshaa khanij or lavan mili hote hai, jo bhaap dwaara vashpit hone se saghan ho kar vishakt str tak pahunch sakate hai
 Control of soil salinity in irrigated land may require excessive water flow and drainage from time to time
