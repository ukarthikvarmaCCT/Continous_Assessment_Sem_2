 There are many concoctions and some believable stories related to the origin of Malvan's name

 bhartiya talwadya, chamada madhe do drum Pakhawaj, Mridang, Khol, Dholak, Nagara, Bongo tabalaa bhartiya sangeet main prayog hone vaala ek talwadya he jo mukhya rup se dakshin asian deshon main bahut prachlit he
 It is in the form of two vertical, cylindrical, leather-plated mouth parts of wood, which are called "right" and "left" according to the tradition of placing them
 yah talwadya hindustani shastreey sangeet main kaaphi mahatvapurn he or atharahavin sadi ke baad se iskaa prayog shashtreey evam up shastreey gayan-vaadan main lagbhag anivaary rup se ho rahaa he
 Apart from this, it has also been used prominently in smooth music and Hindi cinema
 yah baaja bharat, pakistan, nepal, bangladesh, or shri lanka main prachlit he
 Earlier it was used as an instrumental instrument to give a rhythm to singing, playing, dancing etc
, but later many tabla players made it a solo playing medium and also gained considerable fame
 naam tabalaa kii utpatti arabi-farsi mul ke shabd "tabl" se bataayi jaati he
 However, the actual origin of this instrument is disputed - while some scholars consider it to be an evolved form of upward recitation in an ancient Indian tradition, some believe it to be made later than the Pakhawaj, and some also refer to its origin as western Asia
 Huh
 table kaa itihaas sateek taur par namaaloom he or isaki utpatti ke bare main kai upasthapanaayen maujuud hai
 The ideas described in relation to its origin can be divided into two groups: aupniveshik shashan ke dauraan is pariklpana ko kaaphi balpurvak purarsthapit kiya gaya ki table kii mul utpatti muslim senaaon ke saath chalane vaale jode drum se hui he; is sthapana kaa mul arabi ke "tabl" shabd par aadhaarit he jiskaa arth "drum " hota he
 The example of Babur carrying such drums with the army is presented as an example, although these instruments that accompany the Ottoman forces bear no resemblance to the tabla but to the "nakkara"
 duusari sthapana ke mutabiq, allaudin khilji ke samay main, amir khusro ne "awaz baaja" ko kaat kar table kaa rup dene kii baat kahi jaati he
 However, this also does not seem possible because none of the paintings of that time represent any such instrument
 muslim itihaaskaaron ne bhi apane vivaranon main aise kisi vaadyayantra kaa ullekh nahin kiya he
 For example, Abul Faizi has enumerated a long list of instruments in the ain-i-akbari, but the tabla is not mentioned in it
 ek anya tisare matanusaar dilli ke khyaat gayak sadaarang ke shishy or prasiddh pakhaawaj vadak rahamaan khan ke putr, amir khusro ne 1738 i main pakhaawaj se table kaa avishkaar kiya
 Earlier, Khayal used to sing pakhavaj also in singing
 is siddhant main satyata sambhavit he kyonki us samay kii laghu kalakritiyon main table se milte-julate vaadyayantra ke pramaan milte hai
 However, this suggests that the instrument originated in the Indian subcontinent's Muslim communities around Delhi and not from instruments imported from Arab countries
 nil sorrel or pandit ram narayan jaise sangitvid pakhaawaj kaat kar tabalaa banaaye jane kii is kimvadanti main bahut satyata nahin dekhte
 Believers of the theory of Indian origin believe the origin of the tabla in India and say that it only took the Arabic name in the Muslim period
 bhartiya naatyashaastra ke praneta bharat muni ke dwaara urdhvak aalingyak vaadyon ke varnan kii baat kahi jaati he
 In the same way, the genesis of the tabla is told from the pallets called "pushkar", which are carried in the hand
 "pushkar" vaadya ke pramaan chhathvin-saatvin sadi ke mandir utkeernnon main, khaastaur par mukteshwar or bhubaneshwar mandiron main, praapt hote hai
 In these artefacts, the instrumentalist is shown sitting in front of two or three different applauses and he appears to be playing them with his hands and fingers represented
 haalaanki, in nirupanon se yah nahin pataa chalata ki ye vaadyayantra unheen padaarthon se nirmit hai or charmavaadya hi hai, jaisaa kii aadhunik samay kaa tabalaa hota he
 Written evidence of the making of such instruments is available in Sanskrit texts from the materials and the form in which the tabla is made today
 "tabalaa"-jaise vaadyayantra ke nirmaan sambandhi sabase puraani jaankaree sanskrit natya shaastra main milti he
 Details related to playing these rhythms are also found in the Natyashastra
 vahiin, dakshin bhartiya granth, udaahranarth, shilappadikaaram, jisaki rachana pratham shatabdi isvi maani jaati he, lagbhag tees taal vaadyon kaa vivaran detaa he jinamein kuch rassiyon dwaara kase jane vaale or anya shaamil hai, lekin isamen "tabalaa" naamak kisi vaadya kaa vivaran nahin he
 The description of rhythm and rhythm begins with the Vedic literature itself
 do yaa teen angon vaala, doriyon ke sahare lataka kar, haathon se bajaaye jane vaale vaadya yantra "pushkar" ke pramaan paanchavin sadi main hone ke pramaan milte hai jo mrudang ke saath anya talwadyon main gine jate the, haalaanki, tab inhen tabalaa nahin kaha jaataa tha
 The murals of the Ajanta caves dating back to the fifth century represent the upward-facing drums placed on the ground
 baith kaa taal vaadya bajaate hue kalakaaron kaa aisa hi nirupan ellora kii prastar murtiyon main miltaa he, tathaa anya sthalon se bhi
 First-century chinese-tibetan travelers also get a description of the prevalence of small-sized upward drums in India
 jain or buddha granthon, jaise samavysutra, lalitvistaar or sutralankar ityadi main bhi pushkar naamak is talwadya ke vivaran milte hai
 Many Hindu and Jain temples, such as the Eklingji temple in Jaipur, Rajasthan, represent a person playing stone-shaped instruments in stone sculptures
 dakshin main yadav shashan ke samay main bhi aies tarah ke chote talwadyon kaa pramaan miltaa he jab saarangadev sangeet ratnakar kii rachana kar rahe the
 Recent bibliographical claims that tabla is dated to around 1799 are now insignificant, and images from the Bhaje caves attest to the use of such an instrument in ancient India
 jameen par rakh kar bajaaye jane vaale urdhvamukhi vaadyon ke pramaan kai hindu mandiron se praapt hue hai jo 500 ipu ke aasapaas tak ke samay ke hai
 One can take the example of Hoysaleshwara Temple, Karnatakam as evidence of the presence of such instruments in South India, in which a carving depicts a female playing tabla-like instrument in a dance ceremony
 tabalaa, bajaane kii kala ke aadhaar par mrudang or pakhaawaj se alag he
 In this, the artistic speed of the fingers of the hand is more important
 vahiin, pakhaawaj or mrudang panjon kii gati se bajaaye jate hai kyonki inpar aghat kshaitij rup se kiya jaataa he or is prakaar inke bolon main jatilta utani nahin jitani table main pai jaati he
 Hence, the similarity of tabla can be established with the three instruments in phonetic and instrumental studies; The "right", like the pakhawaj, the "left" shaped like the carpenter, the use of a drum-like gum, all three are obtained
 "tabalaa" ke do ang hote hai, arthath isamen do drum hote hai jinka aakaar or akruti ek duusare se kuch bhinnata liye hoti he
 Technically, only the organ played by a straight-handed player, rather than the right hand, is called a tabla
 aam bhashaa main ise daayan yaa dahinaa kehete hai
 It is about 15 cm in diameter and 25 cm in height
 baayen vaale hisse ko kshetra anusaar dagga, duggi athwa dhama bhi kehete hai
 Older images have found the shape of the right and left limbs to be approximately the same and sometimes smaller than the left
 haalaanki, ab bayen kaa aakaar table kii tulana main kaaphi bada hota he
 The right or tabla is often made of wood, while the left is also made of clay or both can be made of brass or flower
 bayen, chaude munh vaala, chamade madha drum hota he jiskaa aakaar lagbhag 20 centimetre vyas vaala or 25 centimetre oonchaai vaala hota he
 Between the cords on the right there are small wooden cylinders, which can be replaced by the hammering of the cords with a hammer
 is kriya ko sur milaanaa kehete hai
 The acoustics of the tabla's sound are matched with the raga's main voice "sa" during singing, which is called the tabla melding on the "plot"
 sitar ke saath, chunki taar vaadya or unchi tikshnata kaa vaadya he, table ko "pancham" par bhi milaayaa jaataa he
 The left is commonly placed in the lower vowel "mandra v" than the tabla
 kalakaar apni hatheli ke pichley hisse ke dabaav dwaara bhi baayen ke suron main maamuli badlaav kar sakate hai
 Due to asymmetry in the size of these two organs, sharp and playful speech - ta, tin, na, etc
 are played on the right and due to the large size of the left, the sound of loud sound, sound, etc
 is played on the left
 isiilie "baayen" ko "base drum" kii tarah prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 The leathers of the tabla also have three parts on the face: table ke prayek hisse ke bichobich ek kaale chakatte ke rup main jo hissaa hota he use "syaahi" kehete hai
 It is a coating made by mixing a variety of things, mainly in rice or wheat starch, which after drying has hardened, refining the natural sound of the tabla leather to give it a tinkling sound
 tabalaa nirmaan kii prakriya ke dauraan syaahi kaa samuchit prayog ek nipunata kii cheez he or is vaadyayantra kii gunvattta kaafii had tak syaahi aropan kii kushalta par nirbhar hoti he
 Some players dry the kneaded dough by sticking it to the duggy, rather than the crotch, although this process has to be done each time, and it is removed by scratching after the tabla is played
 punjab main yah abhi bhi prachlan main he or aise "baayen" ko "dhama" kehete hai
 Tabla lyrics are also called "words", "letters" or "letters"
 ye bol paramparaagat rup se likhe nahin balki guru-shishy parampara main maukhik rup se siikhe sikhaaye jate rahe hai
 That is why there is some variety in their names
 alag-alag kshetra or gharaane ke vaadan main bhi bolon kaa antar aata he

 Below is a brief and generalized description of the "fundamentals of Tabla" written by David Courtney and the lyrics written by Balkrishna Garg: tabalaa vaadan ke kul chah gharaane hai: The promoter of the Delhi gharana was the Maestro reformer and besides the Punjab gharana, the other four gharanas are also considered to be an extension of the Delhi gharana

 Switching times range from tens of nanoseconds to a few hundred microseconds, depending on the device
 MOSFET drain source resistances increase as more current flows through the device
 As frequencies increase the losses increase as well, making bjts more attractive
 Power mosfets can be paralleled in order to increase switching current and therefore overall switching power
 Nominal voltages for MOSFET switching devices range from a few volts to a little over 1000 V, with currents up to about 100 a or so
 Newer devices may have higher operational characteristics
 MOSFET devices are not bi-directional, nor are they reverse voltage blocking
 An example of this new device from ABB shows how this device improves on GTO technology for switching high voltage and high current in power electronics applications
 According to ABB, the IGCT devices are capable of switching in excess of 5000 VAC and 5000 a at very high frequencies, something not possible to do efficiently with GTO devices

 All the seven brothers loved their sister very much
 yahan tak ki ve pehle use khaanaa khilaate or baad main swayan khate the
 Once his sister was visiting her in-laws from her in-laws
 shaam ko bhai jab apana vyapaar-vyavsaay band kar ghar aae to dekha unki bahan bahut vyakul thi
 All the brothers sat down to eat and urged their sister to eat them, but the sister told that today she has a waterless fast of Karva Chauth and that she can eat only by looking at the moon and offering it to her
 chunki chandramaa abhi tak nahin niklaa he, isliye vah bhukh-pyaas se vyakul ho uthi he
 The youngest brother does not see the condition of his sister and he burns a lamp on a peepal tree and puts it in a sieve
 dur se dekhne par vah aisa prathit hota he ki jaise chaturthi kaa chaand udit ho rahaa ho
 After this, the brother tells his sister that the moon has come out, you can have food after offering it to him
 bahan khushi ke maare sidhiyon par chadhakar chaand ko dekhati he, use arghya dekar khaanaa khaane baith jaati he
 When she puts the first piece in the mouth, she sneezes
 doosraa tukdaa daalati he to usamen bal nikal aata he or jaise hi teesraa tukdaa munh main daalane kii koshish karti he to uske pati kii mrityu kaa samachar use miltaa he
 She gets scared
 uski bhabhi use sachai se avgat karaati he ki uske saath aisa kyon hua
 Due to wrong break of fast of Karva Chauth, the gods are angry with him and they have done so
 sachai jaanane ke baad karvaa nishchay karti he ki vah apane pati kaa antim sanskaar nahin hone degi or apane satitv se unhen punerjeevan dilaakar rahegi
 She sits near her husband's body for a whole year
 uski dekhbhaal karti he
 She collects the dull grass that grows on her
 ek saal baad phir karvaa chouth kaa din aata he
 All her sisters keep fast of Karva Chauth
 jab bhabhiyaan usase aashirwad lene aati hai to vah prayek bhabhi se 'yama sooyee le lo, piy sooyee de do, mujhe bhi apni jaisi suhaagin bana do' aisa aagrah karti he, lekin har baar bhabhi use agali bhabhi se aagrah karne kaa kah chali jaati he
 In this way, when the sister-in-law of the sixth number comes, Karva repeats the same thing to her
 yah bhabhi use bataati he ki chunki sabase chote bhai kii vajah se uskaa vrath tutaa tha atah uski patni main hi shakti he ki vah tumhaare pati ko dobaaraa jivit kar sakati he, isliye jab vah aae to tum use pakad lenaa or jab tak vah tumhaare pati ko jinda na kar de, use nahin chhodana
 Having said that she leaves
 sabase ant main choti bhabhi aati he
 Karva urges them to become Suhagin too, but she starts to avoid
 ise dekh karvaa unhen jor se pakad leti he or apane suhaag ko jinda karne ke liye kahati he
 Sister-in-law notices her to get rid of her, smokes, but does not stop getting her done
 ant main uski tapasya ko dekh bhabhi pasij jaati he or apni choti angulii ko chirakar usamen se amrit uske pati ke munh main daal detii he
 Karva's husband immediately wakes up saying Shree ganesh-shriganesh
 is prakaar prabhu krupa se uski choti bhabhi ke madhyam se karvaa ko apana suhaag waapas mil jaataa he
 o Shri Ganesh Maa Gauri, the way Karva has received the gift of Suhagan to you, so all the Suhaginas should get it
 is katha kaa saar yah he ki shakprasthapur vedadharma brahman kii vivaahita putree veeravati ne karvaa chouth kaa vrath kiya tha
 According to the rules, she had to eat after moonrise, but she did not get hungry and got upset
 uske bhaaiyon se apni bahan kii vyakulata dekhi nahin gai or unhone pipal kii aad main aatishbaajee kaa sundar prakaash failaakar chandroday dikhaa diya or veeravati ko bhojan kara diya
 The result was that her husband immediately disappeared
 adheer veeravati ne baarah maheene tak prayek chaturthi ko vrath rakhaa or karvaa chouth ke din uski tapasya se uskaa pati punah praapt ho gaya
 Once upon a time, a proud woman named Karva lived with her husband in a village by the river
 ek din uskaa pati nadi main snaan karne gaya
 While bathing, a manger held her leg there
 vah manushya karvaa-karvaa kah ke apni patni ko pukaarane laga
 Hearing his voice, his wife Karwa ran away and came and tied the manger with raw thread
 magar ko baandhakar yamraj ke yahan pahaunchi or yamraj se kehane lagi- he bhagwan! magar ne mere pati kaa pair pakad liya he
 In the guilt of taking that leg, you take it to hell with your force
 yamraj bole- abhi magar kii aayu shesh he, atah main use nahin maar saktaa
 Asked to get it done, if you do not do this, i will curse you and destroy you
 sunakar yamraj dar gaye or us pativrata karvaa ke saath aakar magar ko yamapuri bhej diya or karvaa ke pati ko dderghaayu di
 Hey mother! Protect your husbands as you protected your husband
 ek baar pandu putr arjuna tapasya karne nilgiri naamak parvat par gaye
 Draupadi was very upset here
 unki koi khabar na milane par unhone krishna bhagwaan kaa dhyaan kiya or apni chintaa vyakt kii
 Lord Krishna said- Bahna, a similar question was once asked by Goddess Parvati to Shankar
 pujan kar chandramaa ko arghya dekar phir bhojan grahan kiya jaataa he
 Karve of gold, silver or clay are exchanged among themselves, which enhances mutual love
 pujan karne ke baad mahilaayein apane saas-sasur evam bado ko pranaam kar unka aashirwad leti hai
 Then Shankarji told Mata Parvati the fast of Karva Chauth
 is vrath ko karne se striyaan apane suhaag kii raksha har aane vaale sankat se vaise hi kar sakati hai jaise ek brahman ne kii thi
 There was a Brahmin in ancient times
 uske chaar ladke evam ek gunavati ladki thi
 Once the girl was in her maternal home, then Karva Chauth had a fast
 usne vrath ko vidhipurvak kiya
 She remained waterless throughout the day
 kuch khaaya-piyaa nahin, par uske chaaron bhai pareshaan the ki bahan ko pyaas lagi hogi, bhukh lagi hogi, par bahan chandroday ke baad hi jal grahan karegi
 The brothers could not keep up, they showed the sister a false moonlight as soon as evening
 ek bhai pipal kii ped par chalni lekar chadh gaya or deepak jalaakar chalni se roshni utpann kar di
 Then the other brother gave a voice to the sister from below- Look sister, the moon has come out, worship and take food
 bahan ne bhojan grahan kiya
 Her husband died after consuming food
 ab vah duhkhi ho vilaap karne lagi, tabhi vahaan se rani indrani nikal rahi thim
 His grief was not seen from them
 brahman kanya ne unke pair pakad liye or apane dukh kaa kaaran poocha, tab indrani ne bataaya- tuune bina chandra darshan kiye karvaa chouth kaa vrath tod diya isliye yah ksht mila
 Now, if you fast for the whole year for the fourth time, your husband will be alive
 usne indrani ke kahe anusaar chouth vrath kiya to punah saubhagyawati ho gai
 Therefore every woman should do this fast for the longevity of her husband
 draupadi ne yah vrath kiya or arjuna sakushal manovanchit fal praapt kar waapas laut aae
 Since then, Hindu women observe the Karva Chauth fast for their unbroken harmony

 unki kritiyon kii suchi nimnlikhit he- Dhumak is a village in Chamoli district of Garhwal division under the state of Uttarakhand in Joshimath tehsil of India
 chakravaat gumti hui vayurashi kaa naam he
 There are two distinctions of a cyclone depending on the region of origin: ushnavalayik chakravaat - ye vayusanghathan yaa tufaan hai, jo ushn katibandh main teevr or anya sthanon par saadhaaran hote hai
 They cause abundant rainfall
 inkaa vyas 50 se lekar 1,000 mile tak kaa tathaa apekshaakrit nimna vayudab vaala kshetra hota he
 They run at speeds ranging from 20 to 30 miles per hour
 inamen vayughurnan 90 se lekar 130 mile prati ghante tak kaa hota he
 They are called Prabhanjan and Chinasagar in the West Indies and tornado in the Philippines and Tornado in the US and Willie Willies in Australia
 ushnavalaypar chakravaat - yah madhya evam ucch akshanshon kaa nimna vayudab vaala tufaan he
 Its velocity spirals from 20 to 30 mph
 praaia: isse himpat evam varsha hoti he
 Both types of cyclones circulate counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere

 This article has been translated from this version of the Wikipedia article Cyclone
 mausam vigyaan main, chakravaat ek aisa band paripatr he jiskaa taral padaarth, prithvi ke samaan ek hi disha main chakkar lagaataa rahata he
 It usually rotates in a spiral shape, clockwise in the northern hemisphere of the earth and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere
 bade chakravaat vaale parisancharan lagbhag hameshaa kam vayumandaleey dabaav ke kshetron par kendrit rahete hai
 The largest low-pressure systems are called core polar cyclones and extra-tropical cyclones that live on a cyanoptic scale
 garm sat chakravaat jaise ushnkaribandheey chakravaat, messosaclones or dhruviya kam chote messoscale ke bheetar rahati hai
 Intertropical cyclones are intermediate in size
 ye chakravaat prithvi ke baahar anya grahon par jaise mangal or varun par bhi dekhe gaye hai
 Cyclogenesis describes the process of cyclone formation and fermentation
 chakravaati anchhatirikt ushn katibandheey chakravaat bade akshanshon vaale taapmaana par tarangon kaa rup dhaaran karte he jinhen baroclinics kshetra kaha jaataa he
 The same region shrinks and changes in the atmosphere when it is closed in the cyclonic circulation or takes a violent form
 baad main yahi chakravaat thande kendron ke rup main ban jate he
 The path of a cyclone flows in polar or tropical regions in a cycle of 2 to 6 days
 mausam alag ghanatv vaali hawaaon ke do bhaagon ko alag karata he or mausamik ghatana chakra main sabase pramukh hota hai
 Fractions of air can vary in temperature or humidity
 majboot thandi hawaaen aamtaur par gambhir mausam main tufaan kii sankeern patteeyon ke rup main, kabhi kabhi prachand rekhaon ke rup main to kabhi sukhi rekhaon ke rup main dikhaai deteen hai
 They form circulation centers in the west and usually move from west to east
 Warm winds remain east of the cyclone center and appear mostly as stratiform
 ye chakravaateey path main dhruv kii ore badhati rahati he
 Closed centers enter the cyclonic life cycle late and wrap up the storm center
 ushnkaribandheey chakravaati ansh ushnkaribandheey chakravaaton ke vikaas kii prakriya kaa varnan karata he
 Tropical cyclone latent heat is driven by latent heat of meaningful thunderstorms and is of hot origin
 chakravaaton sahi paristhitiyon main, antah ushn katibandheey, atirikt katibandheey or ushnkaribandheey charnon ke bich parivartan kar sakate hai
 Warm core cyclones over land take the form of misocyclones and can also cause storm formation
 missosexlones se jalstambh bhi ban sakate hai, lekin zyaadaatar ucch asthirataa or kam urdhwadhar hawa katarani ke vaataavaran se viksit hoti he
 All cyclones have some common structural characteristics
 jaise jo kam dabaav vaale kshetra hote hai, unka kenndra sabase kam vayumandaleey dabaav ke kshetra main sthit hota he or paripakv ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ke mukhya ansh ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Near the center, the shear force pressure and the Coriolis force must be in a balanced ratio, otherwise a change in pressure can cause a cyclone to collapse
 coreolis prabhaav se ek bade chakravaat ke aasapaas kii vaayu kaa pravaah uttari golarddh main dakshinavart disha main or dakshini golarddh main vamavart disha main ghumta he
 Cyclogenesis is caused by the strengthening of the cyclonic circulation that develops in the atmosphere
 sexogenesis, kai vibhinn prakriyaaon ke liye ek chhatrinuma pad he, jinke parinaam se chakravaat kaa vikaas ho saktaa he
 This can occur at various scales
 sooksham paimaane se le kar sankshipt paimaane tak 
attirikt ushnkaribandheey chakravaat thande sat chakravaaton ke rup main parivartit hone se pehle mausam ke agrant main tarangon ke rup main viksit hote he
 Tropical cyclones are latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity and are of warm origin
 messoccchlons bhoomi par sthit garm chakravaaton ke kaaran banate he or tufaan ke gathan kaa kaaran bhi bana sakate hai
 Waterfalls can also be formed from mesocyclones, but they often develop from environments with high instability and low vertical wind shear
 sexogenisis saclosis ke vipareet he, isamen ek vipareet chakravaateey anuroop hota he jo ucch dabaav kshetra kaa gathan karata he -jise antisaclogenesis kaha jataa he
 There are many ways to make a surface low
 talaroop, purv main sthit uttar-dakshin pahaad par sthit kam dabaav vaale sataha ko kam-str parantu adhik dabaav vaali pranali banane par majaboor kar sakate hai
 All the related systems of the mesoscale can also cause the hot core to become inferior
 yah uthal-puthal aage ko ek lahar kii tarah ban jaataa he or shikhar par nimna bana rahata he
 Definitely it will form the following cyclone
 This rotational flow through its trailing pushes the low polar air from the cold front to the equator and the western hot air from the lower polar circle to the warm front
 aamtaur par thanda front, garam front kii tulana main tej gati se chalata he or ucch ghanatv vaali havarashi jo chakravaat se aage hai, ke saath mil jaati he or ucch ghanatv vaali havarashi jo chakravaat ke peeche he vah ek vyapak garm kshetra ko utpann karti he
 At this time a closed amount is formed , pushing the hot air upwards to form a hot trough, which is called a troval
 ushnkaribandheey sexlogenesis ek takneekee shabd he jo vaataavaran main sthit ek ushnkaribandheey tufaan ko viksit karne or majboot karne ke liye prayukt hota he
 The process through which tropical cyclogenesis occurs is different from the decrease in mid-latitude cyclogenesis
 ushnkaribandheey chakravaati ansh, ek garam-sat chakravaat ko viksit karne main sahaayak hota he jo anukool mahatvapurn vaataavaran ke kaaran banataa he
 The six main requirements of tropical cyclogenesis are: sufficiently warm sea surface temperature, atmospheric instability, high humidity in the low to mid-level troposphere, the required Coriolis force, a pre-existent low level or shallow and low vertical shear wind
 Around the world, on average 86 annual tropical storms turn into tropical storms
 in main se 47 tufaan / taqatvar aandhi ban jate hai or 20 gahan ushnkaribandheey chakravaat banate he
 Mesocyclones are formed when the speed of the wind shifts with rapid changes and / or highs, setting a fraction by moving in a drain circle at the bottom of the atmosphere
 ek tufaan kii sanvahani updraft is katarani hawa ko ek golakaar abhivinyas ko upar se ek kinare se uthaata he jiske kaaran sara kaa sara upadraft ek urdhwadhar stambh ke rup main ghumta he
 Mesocyclones are normally relatively localized: they lie between the short scale and the micro scale
 radar imageri in suvidhaon ko pahchaanane ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 The center of the storm is usually calm and is located in one place
 chakravaaton ke chah mukhya prakaar hai: dhruviya chakravaat, dhruviya kam, attirikt ushn katibandheey chakravaat, ant:ushn katibandheey chakravaat, ushnkaribandheey chakravaat or mesosainchlones 
 a polar low is a small-scale, short-lived low-pressure system found on ocean areas in front of the main polar front of both the northern and southern hemispheres
 yah pranali aamtaur par samaanaantar paimaane par kam dikhaai detii he or ek do din se zyada jivit nahin rah sakati he
 They are part of a larger class of mesoscale weather systems
 paaramparik mausam report se dhruviya kam kaa pataa lagaana kathin he or ucch akshansh prakriyaaon, jaise jahajrani, gas or tel platformon ke liye ek khatra hai
 Polar low is also referred to by other terms, such as polar mesoscale vortex, arctic storm, arctic low and cold air pressure
 Usually the term is reserved for more vigorous systems where at least 17 m is near - Surface winds
 1 An extratropical tropical cyclone is an abbreviated scale low-pressure weather system that has neither tropical nor any polar features, associated with a forward and parallel gradient in temperature and snow point, thus called a "baroclinic zone"
 is
 'attirikt ushnkaribandheey' shabd is tathy kaa nirupan karte he ki is prakaar ke chakravaat grah ke katibandhon ke baahar, madhya akshanshon ke bich hote hai
 These systems are reported as 'mid-latitude cyclones' due to their regional formation or post-tropical cyclones, where extra-tropical transition occurs and is often 'low' or 'low' by earlier weather forecasters and the general public
 Pressure 'is described
 ye har rose kii ghatnaayen hai, jo virdohi chakravaaton ke saath, dharti ke adhiktar hisse ke mausam ko banaati hai
 However, extra-tropical cyclones are almost always called baroclinic, as they remain with the western air temperature and snowflake regions and sometimes become barotropic when the temperature distribution near the cyclone is uniform with radius
 is
 ek atirikt ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ek upkatibandheey tufaan main or vahaan se ek antah ushnkaribandheey chakravaat main parinat ho jaataa he agar yah garm pani ke upar rahata he or jo apni mul garmi ko kendriya sanvahan main viksit karata he
 An intramuscular cyclone is a weather system with some characteristics of tropical cyclones and some additional tropical cyclones
 ye bumadhya rekha or 50 wein samanaantar ke bich ban sakate hai
 Since the 1950s, astronomers did not understand whether to call it a tropical cyclone or a more tropical cyclone
 That is why they were called tropical equatorial and semi-tropical, which were also called hybrid cyclones, until 1972, the National Hurricane Center officially recognized this cyclone class
 antah ushn katibandheey chakravaaton ko 2002 se atlantic basin se sarkari ushnkaribandheey chakravaat suchi se naam praapt hone lage
 They have a broad wind pattern, which can hold maximum air that is located farther from the center than tropical cyclones, and is found at temperatures ranging from weak to mid-level
 kyonki ye adhik katibandhon vaale chakravaaton se banate hai, jinka taapmaana anya kati bandhon se thanda hota he, unke gathan ke liye prayukt samudr ke sataha kaa taapmaana ushnkaribandheey chakravaat dahalij kii tulana main teen degree celsius, yaa paanch degree pheranheit se kam hota he jo, 23 degree celsius ke aasapaas hota hai
 This suggests that intertropical cyclones form outside the conventional boundary in stormy weather
 yadhyapi ant:ushnkaribandheey tufaanon main kabhi-kabhaar hi tufaani hawaaon kaa dabaav hota he, ve prakrutit: ushnkaribandheey ho sakate he yadi unke satv garm ho jaaen to 
 a tropical cyclone is a storm system, which is a low pressure center and produces thunderstorms, strong winds and high rainfall
 ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat, tab banataa he jab nam hawa se garmi nikalati he, jiske parinamswaroop nam hawa main nihit bashp jari ho jaataa he
 These are formed by different heat components and are called other cyclonic storms, such as nor'easters, European windstorms, polar less, storm systems
 yah shabd 'ushnkaribandheey' donon bhugolic roopon ko suchit karata he, jo anany rup se globe ke ushnkaribandheey kshetron main paye jate he or samudri hawa, ushnkaribandheey hawa samoohon main banati he
 The term 'cyclone' refers to a cyclonic cyclone by nature, which rotates in the northern hemisphere, in the Uttaravarat and in the southern hemisphere
 sthaan or shakti ke aadhaar par ushnkaribandheey chakravaato ko anya naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he, jaise tufaan, aandhi, ushnkaribandheey tufaan, chakravaati toofaan, ushnkaribandheey dabaav, yaa keval chakravaat
}saamanyatya, ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat ko atlantic basin or prashanth mahaasaagar main tufaan kaha jaataa he
 Although tropical cyclones can produce extremely powerful winds and torrential rains, they are also capable of producing high waves and destructive storms
 ve garm pani ke bade nikaayon par viksit hoti he or jameen ke uppar hilne se unki takat kam ho jati he
 For this reason, tropical storms can cause considerable damage to coastal areas, while inland areas are relatively safe from them
 baari varsha tathaapi, antardeshiy kshetron main baadh kii sthiti utpann karte hai or tufaani tarange samudr tat ke upar vyapak tateey baadh kii sthiti paidaa karte hai
 Although their effects on human populations can be devastating, tropical cyclones can provide relief from drought conditions
 ve katibandhon se garmi or urja ko uthaakar shitoshna akshansh kii ore le jaataa he, jiske kaaran ye vaishvik vaataavaran parisancharan tantra kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa ban jate he
 As a result, tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the Earth's atmosphere, keeping temperatures around the world relatively stable and warm
 kai ushnkaribandheey chakravaat us samay viksit hote hai jab vaataavaran main ek kamjor uthal-puthal ke saath vaataavaran kii sthiti anukool hoti he
 Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics
 ushnkaribandheey pranaliyaan tab bahati hawaaon ke saath shobhamandal main chali jaati he ; yadi sthiti anukool ho to, ushnkaribandh ashaant ho jaataa he or phir vahaan ek centre viksit ho jaataa he
 At the other end of the spectrum, if conditions around the system deteriorate or tropical cyclones make landfall, the system weakens and eventually collapses
 ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat attirikt ushnkaribandheey chakravaat tab ban jaataa he jab vah ucch akshansh kii ore badhata he agar isaki urja kaa mul sankshepan dwaara jari kii gai ho to vah garmi se badal kar hawa raashiyon ke bich vaataavaran main badal jaataa he; ek kriyasheel drushti se kaha ja saktaa he ki, ek ushnkaribandheey chakravaat apane atirikt sankraman ke dauraan ant: ushnkaribandheey nahin banataa 
 Mesocyclone is a vortex of air, contained in a diameter of about 2 km and 10 km closed storm
 hawa uthati he or ek hi urdhwadhar dhuree, ek hi disha main gumti he jaise kisi bhi golarddh main kam dabaav vaali pranali main gumti he
 They are often stormy, meaning they are associated with a localized low pressure area
 is tarah ke tufaano se sataha par prachand hawaaen chalati hai or ole padate hai
 Mensocyclones are often found together with infestations in the upper cell, where they can become blind
 har varsh lagbhag 1700 messosaclones sanyukt rajya america main banate hai, lekin unamem se keval aadhe bhayankar toofaan banate hai
 Cyclones are not unique to the Earth
 varun grah par chote andhere bindu kii tarah chakravaati tufaan ullaspurn grahon par aam hai
 It is also known as the Magician's Eye, as it is one third the diameter of the Great Dark Spot
 isane 'jaadugar kii aankh' kaa naam paaya kyonki yah ek aankh kii tarah lagata he
 This presence is caused by a white cloud in the middle of the magician's eye
 mangal ne bhi tufaani hawaaon kaa pradarshan kiya he
 Jovial storms, such as the Great Red Spot, are commonly mistakenly known as giant storms and cyclonic storms

 The fire of magnetic tunnels is caused by the impact of the ship's magnetic field
 dhvanik surangon kaa fire jahaaj ke nodakon dwaara utpann shorgul se hota he
 Pressurized tunnels fire from pressure waves generated by a ship moving in water
 kuch surangon kaa fire do prabhaavon, jaise 'chumbakeey evam dhvanik' yaa 'dabaav evam chumbakeey', se hota he
 These are called 'joint combinations' and the simultaneous presence of both effects is necessary for firing the tunnel
