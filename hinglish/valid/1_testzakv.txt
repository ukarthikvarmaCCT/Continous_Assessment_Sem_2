 bharat ke mogul samrajya kaa sansthaapak babar timur kaa hi vanshaj tha
 Taimur was born in 1336 in Mavraunnahar, a region between the rivers trans-oxiana, Trans Amu and Sir, in a place called Kesh or shahar-e-sabz
 uske pita ne islam kabool kar liya tha
 Hence, Timur was also a staunch follower of Islam
 vah bahut hi pratibhavan or mahatvakankshi vyakti tha
 Like the great Mongol conqueror Genghis Khan, he also wanted to trample the whole world with his power and, like Alexander, wished for Vishwavijaya
 san 1369 main samarkand ke mongol shaasha ke mar jane par usne samarkand kii gaddi par kabja kar liya or iske baad usne puri shakti ke saath digvijay kaa kaary prarambh kar diya
 He established his military system only on Genghis Khan's method and, like Genghis, he invaded far-off countries with cruelty and ruthlessness and destroyed them
 1380 or 1387 ke bich usne khurasaan, sistan, afghanistan, faras, ajarbaijan or kurdistan aadi par akraman kar unhen adheen kiya
 In 1393 he established suzerainty over Mesopotamia over Baghdad

 Agreed
 murtipuja kaa vidhwans to akraman kaa bahaanaa maatr tha
 In fact, he was attracted by India's gold
 bharat kii mahan samruddhi or vaibhav ke bare main usne bahut kuch baaten sun rakhi thim
 Therefore, to plunder India's wealth, he had planned an attack
 use akraman kaa bahaanaa foundne kii avashyaktaa bhi nahin mahasoos hui
 At that time the Tughluq Sultanate of Delhi was in a miserable state due to the weak successors of Ferozeshah
 bharat kii is raajnneetik durbalata ne taimur ko bharat par akraman karne kaa swayan suavasar pradaan diya
 In early 1398, Timur first sent one of his grandchildren, Pir Mohammed, to attack India
 usne multan par gheraa daalaa or chha: maheene baad usapar adhikaar kar liya
 In April 1398, Timur himself left for India from Samarkand with a heavy army and in September he crossed the Indus, Jhelum and Ravi
 13 oktober ko vah multan se 70 mile uttar-purab main sthit tulumba nagar pahunchaa
 He looted this city and killed many of its inhabitants and enslaved many

 For five days, the whole city was badly looted and its unfortunate inhabitants were slaughtered or imprisoned

 Taimur also took many captive women and craftsmen with him
 bharat se jo karigar vah apane saath le gaya unase usne samarkand main anek imaaraten banavaain, jinamein sabase prasiddh uski swaniyojit jama masjid he
 Timur came to India only for plunder
 uski ichha bharat main rahakar rajya karne kii nahin thi
 So, after staying in Delhi for 15 days, he left for home
 9 janvari 1399 ko usne meerut par chadhaai kii or nagar ko lutaa tathaa nivaasiyon ko katl kiya
 He then reached Haridwar where he defeated two armies of the nearby Hindus
 shivalik pahadiyon se hokar vah 16 janvari ko kangra pahunchaa or usapar kabja kiya
 After this he marched on Jammu
 in sthanon ko bhi lutaa khasota gaya or vahaan ke asankhya nivaasiyon ko katl kiya gaya
 Thus, on 19 March 1399, after extensive damage to India's life, wealth and property, he again crossed the Indus River and returned to his country from Bharatbhoomi
 bharat se lautne ke baad taimur se san 1400 main anatolia par akraman kiya or 1402 main angora ke yuddh main automan turkon ko buree tarah se parajeet kiya

 Then the fort of Bhatner was surrounded
 vahaan ke rajputon ne kuch yuddh ke baad haar maan lee or unhen kshamaadaan de diya gaya
 But he was attacked as soon as he was indiscriminate

 ' dilli ke paas loni hindu nagar tha
 But some Muslims were also prisoners
 taimur ne aadesh diya ki musalamaanon ko chhodkar shesh sabhi hindu bandi islam kii talwaar ke ghat utaar diye jaayen
 By this time, the number of Hindu inmates had reached one lakh
 jab yamuna paar kar dilli par akraman kii taiyaari ho rahi thi uske saath ke amiron ne usase kaha ki in bandiyon ko camp main nahin choda ja saktaa or in islam ke shatruon ko swatantra kar dena bhi yuddh ke niyamon ke viruddh hoga
 Timur writes tughlaq badshaah ko haraakar taimur ne dilli main pravesh kiya
 He came to know that the Hindus have taken refuge in Delhi with their large number of women and children and valuable things while fleeing from the surrounding countryside

 He studied at the University of Turin and the Berlin Observatory
 1859-1860 main unhone pulakovo vedhashala main kaam kiya or baad main brera vedhashala main chalis varshon se upar kaam kiya
 He was also a member of the Kingdom of Italy, a member of Akademia di Linci, The Academia delle Scienze di Torino and The Regio Istithutho Lombardo and is particularly known for his study of Mars
 unki bhatiji, elsa scaparelli, ek prasiddh faishneble vastra-nirmaataa bani
 Sciparelli's contributions also include his telescopic observations about Mars
 apane praarambhik anuvikshan main unhone mangal ke "samudron" or "mahadwipon" ko naam diya
 During the "great opposition" state of the planet in 1877, he noticed dense webs of linear structures on the surface of Mars, which he called "kanali" in Italian, meaning "channels" in English, but incorrectly translated "kanals"
 Has been made
 yadhyapi dwitiya shabd kritrim nirmaan ko suchit karata he, purvavarti shabd yah sanketarth detaa he ki yah bhoomi kaa prakritik vinyas bhi ho saktaa he
 This mistranslation led to various beliefs about life on Mars, as the "canals" of Mars soon became well-known, causing waves of hypothesis, speculation and folklore about the possibility of life on Mars

 But later, with the observation of the Italian astronomer Visonzo Sarulli, the scientists ensured that the famous channels were in fact mere sight
 apni pustak, life on mars main scaparelli likhte hai ki: "ham jin sahi channelon ko jaanate hai, unke bajaay hamen mitti main aise garton kii kalpana kerani chahie, jo adhik gahare naa hon, hajaaron mile sidhi disha main 100, 200 kilo meter yaa adhik chaude hon
 i have already pointed out that in the absence of rainfall on Mars, these channels may have been the main structures through which water can spread to the dry surface of the planet
 " As observer of the solar system's bodies, Schaparelli discovered the asteroid 69 Hesperia on April 26, 1861, while working on the pair constellations and demonstrated that the Percids and Leonids are associated with meteorite comets
 udhaaharan ke liye, unhone sabit kiya ki leonids ulkapaat kaa parikrama-path, dhoomaketu temple-tatal se mail khaataa he
 His observation played a major role in astronomers' hypothesis that meteorites could be comet marks, which later proved to be very accurate

 Unlike later modern astronomers, he understood for the first time that the concentric bodies of Eudoxus of Nidus and Callipus are not to be taken as physical objects, but simply as part of the algorithm of the modern Fourier series

 The names of the rulers of Mithila date back to very ancient times in Indian literary sources

 The ancestry tradition of Janak is given in Valmiki Ramayana
 ramayana main sirdhvaj janak swayan hi apane purvaj raajaaon ke naam dasharath ko bataate hai
 According to Valmiki Ramayana, the following kings ruled Mithila till the Ramayana period
 ramayana kaal tak ke videh vansheey raajaaon ke naam valmikiy ramayana main spashtatya ullikhit rahane ke kaaran puraanon kii apeksha ve naam hi sweekaarya hai, parantu sirdhvaj janak ke baad ke raajaaon ke naam swaabhaavik rup se valmikiy ramayana main na hone ke kaaran puraanon kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 Among them, one of the most ancient Puranas and the basis of the relatively consistent Srivishnupurana is more appropriate

 haalaanki is samay main shashan-pranali ganatantratmak hi thi yaa punah rajtantr kaa udai ho gaya tha, iskaa spasht pramaan uplabdh nahin he
 It is also mentioned that in the modern land known as Darbhanga of Nanpur Pargana, a king named Alark was born and was followed by another king named Bali
 ye raja bali videh raajaaon ke kendriya shashan ke ant se lekar mauryaal tak main yaa phir or baad main vastutah kab hue the, is sambandh main nishchayatmak pramaan kaa abhaav he
 Due to not being mentioned in the mythological and Jataka literature and after the establishment of republican rule, it seems that these kings would have been sacrificed by Mahapadmanand again only after the end of the Republic, that is, in the Mauryan period or later
 vartmaan darbhanga pramandal ke madhubani jile main prasiddh balirajgad isi raja bali kaa rajdhani-sthal rahaa hoga, is baat kii atyadhik sambhaavna he
 The founding of Mauryan antiquities in the excavation here is also an indicator of this

 bhrigu muni ke putr chyavan mahaan tapasvi the
 Once he sat meditating, he spent thousands of years doing penance
 yahan tak ki unke sharir main dimak-mitti chadh gai or lata-patton ne unke sharir ko dhank liya
 At the same time, King Sharyati came to this forest with his four thousand queens and the only beautiful daughter Sukanya
 sukanya apni saheliyon ke saath ghoomte huye dimak-mitti evam lata-patton se dhanke huye tap karte chyavan ke paas pahunch gai
 He saw two round holes appearing in the termite-clay mounds which were actually the eyes of the Chyavan sage
 sukanya ne kautuhalvash un chhidron main kaante gada diye
 As soon as thorns started falling, blood started flowing from those holes
 jise dekhakar sukanya bhaybheet ho chupchaap vahaan se chali gai
 Chyavan Rishi became blind due to thorns in his eyes
 apane andhe ho jane par unhen bada krodh aayaa or unhone tatkaal sharyaati kii sena kaa mel-mutr ruk jane kaa shaap de diya
 King Shariati got very upset with this incident and asked if anyone had given any kind of trouble to the Chyavan Rishi
 Sukanya told all the things to her father on asking him like this
 raja sharyaati ne tatkaal chyavan rishi ke paas pahunch kar kshamayachna kii
 Chyavan Rishi said that Rajan! Your daughter has committed a terrible crime
 yadi tum mere shaap se mukt hona chaahate ho to tumhen apni kanya kaa vivaah mere saath karnaa hoga
 Thus Sukanya was married to the Chyavan Rishi
 sukanya atyant pativrata thi
 Many years were spent serving blind Chyawan Rishi
 hathaat ek din chyavan rishi ke ashram main donon ashwanikumar aa pahunche
 Sukanya gave him due respect and worship
 ashwanikumar bole, "kalyani! ham devataaon ke vaidya hai
 Pleased with your service, we are providing light to your husband's eyes again and giving them puberty
 tum apane pati ko hamaare saath sarovar tak jane ke liye kaho
 "both Ashwani Kumaras took a dip in the lake with the Chyavan Rishi
 dubkee lagaakar nikalate hi chyavan rishi kii ankhen thik ho gayi or ve aswani kumaar jaise hi yuvak ban gayi
 Their appearance, shape, etc
 became exactly like that of Ashwani Kumaras
 unhone sukanya se kaha ki devi! tum hamamen se apane pati ko pahchaan kar use apane ashram le jaao
 On this Sukanya recognized her husband with his sharp intellect and pathetic religion and held her hand
 sukanya kii tej buddhi or pativrat dharm se ashwanikumar atyant prasann huye or un donon ko aashirwad dekar vahaan se chale gayi
 When King Sharyati got the news of Chyavan Rishi's eyes recovering to get new youth, he was very happy and he talked to Chyavan Rishi to meet him and perform Yajna
 chyavan rishi ne unhen yajna kii diksha di
 When Ashwanyakumaras were given a part in that Yajna, then Devraj Indra objected that Ashwanekumar is the physician of the gods, hence he is not eligible to participate in the Yajna
 kintu chyavan rishi indra kii baton ko ansuna kar ashwanikumaron ko somras dene lage
 Enraged by this, Indra struck Vajra at him, but the sage stopped the Vajra with his Tapobal and created a terrible monster
 vah rakshas indra ko nigalane ke liye daud padaa
 Fearing Indra, Ashwanekumar accepted the part of the yagna and Chyavan Rishi consumed the demon and freed Indra from his suffering

 swapn vyakhya sapanom ko arth dene kii prakriya he
 In many ancient societies, such as Egypt and Greece, dreaming was considered to be a supernatural communication or divine intervention that could only be resolved by those with certain powers
 aadhunik samay main, manovigyaan kii vibhinn vichaardhaaraon ne sapanom ke arth ke bare main siddhant prastut kiye hai
 One of the oldest written examples of dream interpretation comes from the epic Epic of Gilgamesh in Babylonia
 gilgamesh ne sapana dekha ki ek kulhada aasmaan se gira tha
 People gathered around him in praise and worship
 gilgamesh ne apni maa ke saamne kulhada phenk diya or phir use patni kii tarah gale se laga liya
 Her mother Ninsun explained the dream
 unhone kaha ki sheeghra hi koi shaktishaalee prakat hoga
 Gilgamesh will struggle with him and try to defeat him, but he will not succeed
 antat ve kareebi dost ban jaaenge or mahaan vasteen hasil karenge
 He added, "you hugged her like a wife, this means that he will never leave you
 That is how your dream is solved
" " haalanki yah udhaaharan bhi sapane ko bhavishyasuchak ke rup main dekhne kii pravriti pradarshit karata he, ninsun kii vyakhya bhi ek samakaleen drushtikon vaali soch rakhti he
 Gendered and aggressive, the ax symbolizes a male who will be aggressive initially but will later turn into a friend
 To embrace an ax is to convert aggression into affection and harmony
 pracheen misr main pujari swapn vyakhyaakaar ke rup main bhi kaam karte the
 Joseph and Daniel are mentioned for interpreting dreams sent by God, and in fact the Bible describes many dream events as supernatural revelations
 hiyeroglifix dwaara sapanom ke chithran evam unki vyakhyaayein spasht hai
 Dreams have been of significant importance in the history of most cultures
 pracheen unani mandiron kaa nirmaan karte the jinhen ve esclapions kehete the or jinamein biimaar logon ko upachaar hetu bheja jaataa tha
 It was believed that the cure would be effected by divine grace by dreaming within the boundaries of the temple
 sapanom ko bhavishyasuchak yaa vishesh mahatva ke shagun bhi mana jaataa tha
 Artemidorus of Daldis in the second century AD wrote a comprehensive treatise titled Onirochritica
 haalanki artemidoras kaa maananaa tha ki sapane bhavishya kii bhavishyavaanee kar sakate the, unhone sapanom ke liye anek samakaleen drushtikonon kaa purvanumaan diya tha
 He thought that the images of a dream could have many meanings and the image could be understood by decoding it in its constituent words
 terianon ke khilaaf yuddh karte samay sikandar ne sapana dekha ki ek aiyash unki dhaal par nrity kar rahaa tha
 Artemidorus writes that this dream was interpreted as: Sator = sa Tirose, predicting that Alexander would be victorious
 frid ne artemidoras ke is udhaaharan ko sweekaar kiya tha jab unhone prastaav kiya ki sapanom kii vyakhya ek chitra paheli kii bhaanti kerani chahie
 Some hadiths in medieval Islamic psychology indicate that dreams have three parts, early Muslim scholars have also distinguished three types of dreams: false dreams, pathological dreams and and true dreams
 Ibn Sirin became famous for his books on dreams, Ta'bir al-ru'ya and Muntakhab al-kalam Fei Tabir al-ehlam
 sapanom kii vyakhya kii reeti se lekar kisi ke sapane main quran kii khaas sura padhane kii vyakhya tak, swapn vyakhya par yah kaary 25 khandon main vibhajit he, ve likhte hai ki aam aadmi ke liye yah mahatvapurn he ki vah ek aalim kii sahaayta le jo saanskrithik sandarbhon tathaa aise kaarnon or vyakhyaaon kii sahi samaj ke saath sapanom kii vyakhya karne main maargdarshan kar sakate hai
 al-kindi also wrote a treatise on dream interpretation called On Sleep and Dreams
 chetana adhyayan main al-farabi ne sapanom par ek granth, on da coj of drims likhaa tha jo usiki pustak book of opinions of da pipal of da idial city ke 24wein adhyay ke rup main shaamil hua tha
 He was the first to distinguish between dream interpretation and the nature and causes of dreams
 da canan of medicine main avisena ne manodasha ke siddhant kaa vistaar bhaavnaatmak pahaluon, maansik kshamta, naitik pravritiyon, aatm-chetana, gatividhiyon tathaa sapanom ko shaamil karne ke liye kiya
 Ibn Khaldun's Muqaddimah states that "confused dreams" are images of imagination which are stored inside by eclipse and after the person is retired from the sense perception, the ability to think works on them
 maanak swapn-vyakhya par 16veen shatabdi main chen shiyuan dwaara sankalit ek paramparaagat chini pustak lofti principles of dream interpritesan he
 Chinese thinkers also raised deep thoughts about dream interpretation, the question of how we know we are dreaming and how we know we are awake
 yah chuang-tju main likhaa he: "ek baar chuang chau ne sapana dekha ki vah ek titali tha
 He flew around happily, quite pleased with the situation he was in and he knew nothing about Chuang Chow
 ab vah jaagaa or paaya ki vah to phir se bilkul chuang chau hi he
 Now Chow dreams that he was a butterfly or does Butterfly now dream that he was Chow? This raises the question of reality monitoring, an extremely interesting topic in modern cognitive neuroscience
 19veen shatabdi ke ant main swapn vyakhya ko manovishleshan ke ek bhaag ke rup main liya gaya tha; sapane kii vidit, prakat vishaywastu kaa vishleshan kiya jaat he to swapndrushtaa ke maanas ke liye uskaa adrishy arth saamne aata he
 One of the original works on this subject is Sigmund Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams
 saanchaa:psychoanalysis It was in his book, The Interpretation of Dreams, first published in 1899, that Sigmund Freud first argued that the subject matter of all dreams is the motivation and the catalyst for dreaming is often the day before the dream
 Can be found in the events of what he called "the remnant of the day"
 In the case of very young children, Freud claimed, it can be easily seen that young children dream of fulfilling the desires that arose in them the previous day
 lekin, vayaskon main sthiti or adhik jatil he, he frid ke siddhant main, sapanom kii tathakthith "prakat vishyawastu" avchetan main upasthit avyakt swapn-vichaaron kaa atyadhik prachhann vyutpaada hone ke saath, vayaskon ke sapane viroopit hote hai
 As a result of this distortion and disguise, the true significance of the dream is hidden: The more the patient of a hysteria perceives their relationship to the symptoms of hysterics and the more important they are, the more the dreamer is not able to identify the true meaning of his dream
 frid ke mul nirupan main avyakt swapn-vichaar kaa "sensor" naamak ek antaratmik bal ke adheen hona varnit kiya gaya tha; tathaapi baad ke varshon main unki adhik parishkrut shabdaawalee main, charchaa paraham tathaa "ahan ke raksha balon ke kaary" ke rup main hoti thi
 He believed that these so-called "barriers" in waking life completely prevent the repressed desires of the subconscious from entering consciousness; Although these desires were able to emerge to some extent in the lower state of sleep, the barriers were still strong enough to produce "a veil of disguise" to hide their true nature
 Freud's view was that dreams are compromises that ensure that sleep is not disturbed by "disguised fulfillment of repressed desires", they are successful in representing the fulfillment of desires that would otherwise cause sleep disturbance to the dreamer
 Can wake up frid kaa utkrisht aarambhik swapn vishleshan "irma kaa injection" haih is swapn main frid kii ek puraani marij dard kii shikaayat karti he
 This dream is portrayed by Freud's colleague injecting Irma without being sterilized
 sapanom kii prakat vishaywastu se avyakt swapn vichaar kaa kutanuwaad karne kii takanic kaa pradarshan karne ke liye iskaa upyog karte hue frid hamen sapanom ke tatwon ke saath saahchary ke panne pradaan karte hai
 Freud described the actual technique of psychoanalytic dream-analysis in the following words: frid ne un virupan prakriyaaon ko soochibaddh kiya jo, unhone daawa kiya ki damit ichchhaaon par kaary karke unhen smarit sapanom main parivartit karti hai: in virupanon ke kaaran sapanom kii prakat vishaywastu vishleshan ke dwaara jane gaye avyakt swapn vichaar se atyant bhinn hoti he- in virupanon ko ulat kar avyakt vishtwastu ko janaa ja saktaa he
 Processes include: samaran rahi prakat vishaywastu ke vibhinn tatwon se kisi prakaar kaa arth yaa kahani banane kii swapndrushtaa kii swaabhaavik pravriti ke parinaam, “madhyamik vistaar” ko bhi isamen joda ja saktaa he
 Was eventually accepted as an exception to this principle
 frid ne suvidit rup se manovashleshik swapn-vyakhya ko "mastishk kii achetan gatividhiyon ke gyaan kii ore shahi sadak" ke rup main varnit kiya tha; haalanki ve jis prakaar is vishay par unke vichaaron ko anuchit dhang se prastut kiya gaya yaa samajha nahin gaya, us par afsos or asantosh prakat karne main sakasham the
 On another occasion, he said that the person who succeeded in identifying the difference between latent and manifest content ?? "may have gone beyond most readers of his book Interpretation of Dreams"
 yadhyapi frid ke siddhant ko sire se hi khaarij na karte hue, karl yung ne sapanom ko atrupt ichchhaaon kaa nirupan maanane vaale frid ke siddhant ko ekatarfa or saral mana 
 yung kaa tark tha ki sapane ke saath saahchary ekatra karne kii frid kii prakriya se swapndrushtaa kii maansik avasthaa main pravesh hoga- ek vyakti kaa kisi vastu ke saath saahchary maansik avasthaa ko ujagar karegaa, jaisaa yung ne prayog dwaara dikhaaya - lokin aavashyak nahin ki swapn ke arth ke paas bhi pahunch paaen
 yung aashwast the ki sapanom kii vyakhya kaa dayera adhik bada tha jo vyaktigat evam samuhik donon sahit sampoorn avchetan kii samruddhi or jatiltaaon ko pratibimbit karata tha
 Yung believed the psyche to be a self-regulated organism in which the lack of conscious tendencies is likely to be met by unconscious tendencies in the unconscious
 yung ne swapn saamagree ke vishleshan hetu do buniyadi drushtikon prastaavit kiye: uddeshyparak or vyaktiparak
 uddeshyparak drushtikon main, sapane main prayek vyakti, jo vah he usee ko sanderbhit karata he: maa maa he, premika premika he, aadi
 In the subjective view, each person in the dream represents one aspect of the dreamer
 yung ne tark diya ki swapndrushtaa ke liye vyaktiparak drushtikon ko sweekaar karnaa or adhik kathin he, lekin sarvaadhik achche swapn-kaary main swapndrushtaa yah pahchaan jayega ki swapn ke paatr swapndrushtaa ke anbhigyaat pahalu kaa pratinidhitiv kar sakate hai
 Thus, if the dreamer is being chased by an insane killer, the dreamer will eventually recognize that it was his own violent impulse
 samshti manochikitsakon ne yah daawa karte hue ki swapn main nirjeev vasteen bhi swapndrushtaa ke pahaluon kaa pratinidhitiv kar sakati hai, vyaktiparak drushtikon ko aage badhaayaa he
 Yung believed that primordial forms such as variance, anima, shadow and other dreams manifest themselves in the form of dream symbols or figures
 aisi akritiyaan ek buudhe aadmi, ek yuva naukaraani yaa ek vishalkay makadi kaa rup le sakati hai, jaisaa maamla ho
 Each represents an unconscious tendency that is primarily hidden from the conscious mind
 yadhyapi ye swapndrushtaa ke maanas ke abhinn bhaag hai, ye prakatikaran mukhyatah swaayat the or swapndrushtaa dwaara inhen bahya vyakti ke rup main samajha gaya tha
 The introduction to the primordials that manifested in the form of these symbols, by directly integrating the individual parts of the psyche and contributing to the process of understanding oneself overall, raises awareness for the unconscious tendencies of the individual, which they paramount Believe it
 yung ne mana ki chetan mastishk dwaara damit saamagree, frid kii abhidharana ke anusaar jo achetan banaati hai, ve unki swayan kii chaaya kii dharna ke sadrush hi he, jo ki apane aap main achetan kaa ek chota sa bhaag he
 Yung blindly warns against telling the meaning of dream symbols without a clear understanding of the customer's personal situation
 unhon swapn pratikon ke liye do drushtikon varnit kiye: karnatmak drushtikon tathaa antim drushtikon
 karnatmak drushtikon main, pratik kuch moulik pravritiyon tak kam ho jate hai
 Thus, a sword is a symbol of a penis, so a snake can also symbolize
 antim drushtikon main swapn vyakhyaakaar poochta he, "yahi pratik kyon or doosraa kyon nahin?" is prakaar, ek ek ling kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaali talwaar kathor, paini, nirjeev or vinaashkari he
 a snake representing a penis is living, dangerous, probably poisonous and disgusting
 antim drushtikon aap ko swapndrushtaa kii pravritiyon ke bare main atirikt baaten bhi bataa detaa he
 Technically, Yung recommends exposing the dream and presenting the essence of all information to the dreamer
 yah vilhem stekal dwaara varnit prakriya kaa ek roopantaran tha, jinhone swapn ko ek samachaarpatr kaa ek lekh samajhane or us par ek sheershak likhane ke rup main samajhane kii sifarish kii thi
 a similar process was described by Harry Stack Sullivan as "dream distillation"
 haalanki yung ne aadyarup pratikon kii saarvbhaumikta ko sweekaar kiya, unhone sanket-chhaviyon kaa ek ke saath ek sanketarth kaa apane arth ke saath sambandh hone ke kaaran is dharna kaa virodh kiya
 His approach was to identify the dynamism and fluidity that existed between symbols and their responsible meaning
 swapn ko kinhin purv nirdhaarit vichaaron ke anuroop dhaalane kii bajaay pratikon kii unke marij ke prati apane mahatva ke liye khoj kii jaani chahie
 This prevents dream analysis from becoming a theoretical and dogmatic exercise, that is, moving away from the patient's own psychological state
 is vichaar kii seva main unhone 'chhavi se chipakane'- marij ke kisi vishesh chhavi ke saath saahchary kii gaharaai se khoj karne ke mahatva par bal diya
 In contrast to Freud's free association he considered it a deviation from the prominence of images
 udhaaharan ke liye ve ise ”sauda teble" ke rup main varnit kiya
 a dreamer can be expected to have some connection with this image, being ignorant of any kind of importance or lack of familiarity can raise doubts in anyone's mind
 yung ek marij se chhavi kii jitna ho sake spasht kalpana karne ko kehete the or phir use us chhavi kaa varnan karne ko kehete, maano vah jaanate hi na hon ki "sauda mej" kya hoti thi
 Yung stressed the importance of context in dream analysis
 yung ne jor dekar kaha ki swapn koi ghumaavdaar peli nahin thi jiske gudh arth ko samajha janaa tha, isliye uske peeche ke sachche karnatmak karkon ko gyaat karnaa chahie
 Dreams were not a lie-catching machine, so as to reveal the deception behind conscious thought processes as well as conscious thought processes
 achetan kii tarah sapanom kii apni hi bhashaa thi
 As a representation of the unconscious, dream images have their own primacy and logic
 yung kaa maananaa tha ki sapanom main aprihaary satya, darshanik ghoshnaaen, bhram, aniyantrit kalpanaaen, yaaden, yojanaayen, tarkahin anubhav, yahaan tak ki doorasamvedneey drishy ho sakate the
 Just as the psyche has an illuminated side that we experience in the conscious state, it also has a dark side which we make dream-like fantasies
 yung ne tark diya ki ham apane chetan anubhav ke mahatv par shaq nahin he karte, tab hamen hamaare achetan jivan ke mulya ke sambandh main purvanumaan nahin lagane chahie
 In 1953, Calvin S
 Hall developed a theory of dreams in which dreaming was also considered a cognitive process
 haul kaa tark tha ki ek swapn keval ek vichaar yaa vichaar shrinkhalaa thi jo sone ke dauraan hui, swapn chhaviyaan vyaktig jab bas ek yaa vichaar he ki neend ke dauraan hui ke bare main sochaa anukram tha or sapana chhaviyon vyaktigat dharanaen kaa drishy pratinidhitiv kar rahe hai ki
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi koi sapana dekhtaa he ki us par mitron ne hamalaa kiya he, yah nitrataa ke dar kaa pratyakshikaran ho saktaa he; ek or adhik jatil udhaaharan he, jisamen ek saanskrithik roopak kii aavashyaktaa he, ki sapane main ek billi is baat kaa pratik he ki use apane antargyaan ke prayog kii aavashyaktaa he
 For English speakers, it has been suggested that a dreamer should recognize that there is "more than one way to skin a cat" or, in other words, more than one way to perform a task
 1970 ke dashak main, en farade tathaa anya ne aap-swayan-karen swapn vyakhya par ek pustak prakashit kar ke tathaa sapanom ko saajha karne or vishleshan karne ke liye samooh bana kar swapn vyakhya ko mukhya dhara main laane main sahaayta kii thi
 Faraday focused on the use of dreams on the conditions in one's life
 udhaaharan ke liye, kuch sapane aage ghatane vaali kisi ghatana kii chetavanee ho sakate hai, jaise pariksha main asafal hone kaa sapana, taiyaari na hone kii thik-thik chetavanee ho sakati he
 Outside of such context, it may be related to failing any other test
 yaa isaki shleshatmak prakruti ho sakati he, jaise koi apane jivan ke kisi pahalu kii jaanch karne main asafal rahaa ho saktaa he
 Faraday wrote that "one thing has emerged strongly from modern research that the vast majority are dreams that seem to reflect things that were already on our minds in the last day or two
" 1980 or 1990 ke dashakon main wales clift or jin dilbi clift ne sapanom main utpann chhaviyon or swapndrushtaa ke jaagrath jivan ke bich sambandh par aage khoj kii
 His books, with particular emphasis on remedialism and health, identified patterns in dreams and identified ways of analyzing dreams to discover life's changes
 do shodhakartaaon ne mana he ki sapane ek jaivik kriya he, jahaan saamagree ko kisi vishleshan yaa vyakhya kii aavashyaktaa nahin he, vah saamagree sharir ke shaareerik kaaryon ke ek swachaalit uttejnaa tathaa sahaj maanviya vyavhaar ko majbootee pradaan karti he
 Hence dreams are part of the strategy of human, animal, survival and development
 professor anti rinonsuo ne apane vichaaron ko bhay purvaabhyas tak simit kar liya tha, jahaan sapane hamaari praathmik aatmaraksha kii sahaj pravritiyon kaa prayog karte hai tathaa unhone is tark ko dridhtaa se kai prakashnon main kaha he
 Keith Stevens has expanded this theory to all human tendencies, including danger to oneself, danger to family members, bonding and reproduction of couples, curiosity and challenges, and campaigns for personal superiority and tribal status
 He has categorized a sample out of 22000 Internet submissions into nine categories and demonstrated universal equality of dream content and trend rehearsal
 yah mana gaya he ki sapane kii kriya swachaalit he, saamagree ke jawaab main, kaary karte hue or sharir rasayan ko uttejit karte hue or tantrika sambandhi gatividhiyaan bhi shaamil hongi yadi paridrishy vaastavik jivan main ghatit hota he, taaki uddeshey kaa prapti ke liye sapane ko yaad rakhane kii jarurat na rahe
 It has been argued that, once a dreamer experienced a threat in a dream, it increased his or her ability to face danger in real life, so such dreams are helpful for survival in both humans and animals
 khatre kaa purvabhaas vishisht ho saktaa he, udhaaharan ke liye, ek junglee kute dwaara hamalaa, lekin yah saamaanya bhi ho saktaa he, us sthiti main sapana dekhte samay khatre ke prati shaareerik pratikriya sakriy or prabalit ho jaati he
 In relation to human reproduction, this theory states that pairing, bonding and mating stimulate the reproduction of the species, emphasizing the dreams of selection to fulfill each individual's ambition to find the best mate and find the optimal genetic mixture
 Encourage theory
 is sandarbh main, swapn kaary nishtha or jivan ke liye sahavaas ke maanviya naitik mulyon ke vipareet hai
 In particular, young women often dream of becoming pregnant and giving birth to children, highly positive dreams that encourage direct reproduction
 prasthiti ke bare main, aisa mana jaataa he ki shreshthata yaa hinata se sambandhit sapane, yaa to safalataa kii sakaaratmak jivan paddati dwaara yaa vifaltaa kii nakaaratmak jivan vidha dwaara swapndrushtaa ke taatkaalik maanviya anukram main apni prasthiti sudhaarney ke nishchay ko utprerit karte hai
 Therefore, it is believed that dreams promote competition and reproductive success of those most suitable for the environment
 ant main, anya sapane aanandadaayak swapn uplabdhiyon yaa nirashapurna baadhaon or avarodhon kii charam simaaon ke madhyam se khoj karne tathaa poochtacha karne ke nishchay ko utprerit karte hai
 The latter dreams promote the resolve that we should not give up in the context of our desires, so that individuals and species can move forward in life
 For a dreaming African reindeer, there may be a green pasture atop the hill, splitting an atom for a human dreamer
 jo log sapanom kii vyakhya ke kaary main "ab or tab yaa aksar" lage rahete hai tathaa ve jo "yada-kada athwa kabhi bhi nahin" lagate, ke lakshanon kii tulana kaa bahut kam kaary hua he
 Early unpublished research by Michael Thalborn suggests that "dream interpreters" score high on magical ideas, imaginary trends and paranormal belief
 yah agyaat bana hua he ki kya yah maapdand ab or tab yaa aksar swapn vyakhya karne vaale swapn vyakhyakaaron ke liye hi tay kiye gaye hai yaa inamen manovishleshak chikitsak bhi shaamil hai

 It is a large island almost in the middle of the lake, which is as big as Singapore in size
 iske chaaron ore jhil kaa pani koi 400 meter gaharaa he
 The Batak tribe lives here
 dweep par paryaton kaa vikaas hua he or tat par kai cottage hai
 By the way most of the island is mountainous
 bharat main 9000 isapurv tak paudhe ugane, fasalein ugane tathaa pashu-paalane or krishi karne kaa kaam shuru ho gaya tha
 Soon the human began to live a systematic life and developed tools and techniques for agriculture
 doharaa monsoon hone ke kaaran ek hi varsh main do fasalein lee jane lageen
 As a result, Indian agricultural products started to reach the world market through the then commercial system
 duusare deshon se bhi kuch fasalein bharat main aayin
 Plants and animals were also worshiped because their importance to life was understood
 bharat main pashaan yug main krishi kaa vikaas kitna or kis prakaar hua tha isaki samprati koi jaankaree nahin he
 But there is abundant evidence of excavation of Sindhundi kadha antiquities that five thousand years ago, agriculture was in a very advanced state and people were paying revenue in the form of food grains, according to the large rooms found in archaeologist Muhanjodado
 We do
 vahaan se utkhanan main mili gehun or jau ke namoonon se us pradesh main un dinon inke boe jane kaa pramaan miltaa he
 The grains of wheat found from there are Triticum compactum or Triticum sphaerococcum
 in dono hi jati ke gehun kii kheti aaj bhi punjab main hoti he
 The barley found here is of the Balgear caste
 usee jati ke jau mishra ke pyramido main bhi milte he
 Cotton, for which Sindh is still known, was produced in abundance in those days
 bharat ke nivasee arya krishikarya se purnataya parichit the, yah vaidic sahitya se spasht parilakshith hota he
 The Rigveda and the Artharvaveda contain several agricultural references, which include the mention of agricultural implements and the introduction of agricultural practice
 rugveda main kshetrapati, sita or shunasir ko lakshyakar rachi gai ek richa he jisase vaidic aaryon ke krishivishyak gyaan kaa bodh hota he- Another Richa shows that at that time barley was plowed with plow - atharvaveda se gyaat hota he ki jau, dhan, daal or til tatkaaleen mukhya shasy the- There is also a hint of manure in the Atharvaveda, which shows that people used fertilizer to produce more food - grihy evam shrout sutron main krishi se sambandhit dharmik krityon kaa vistaar ke saath ullekh hua he
 In this, there is a discussion of the law for the sake of rain, it also mentions how to protect the food grains in the field from mice and birds
 panini kii ashtaadhi main krishi sambandhi anek shabdon kii charchaa he jisase tatkaaleen krishi vyavastha kii jaankaree praapt hoti he
 Agriculture has been a family industry in India since the Rig Vedic period and much still remains its form
 logon ko krishi sambandhi jo anubhav hote rahen hai unhen ve apane bacchon ko bataate rahe hai or unke anubhav logon main prachlit hote rahe
 Those experiences eventually took the form of proverbs and proverbs which are popular among various linguists in the name of some agricultural pundit and the peasants remain on the tongue
 hindi bhashabhashiyon ke bich ye ghaagh or bhaddari ke naam se prasiddh he
 Their experiences have been met in the perspective of modern scientific research
 ishtar babul, asur or sumer kii matrudevi thi
 He was the beauty of love, love, desire, war, political power etc
 gairsami-sumeri sabhyataa ke ur, urukh aadi vividh nagaron main uski puja nana, innanna, nina or anunith naamon se hoti thi
 They had their own diverse temples
 inkaa mahatv anya deviyon kii bhanti apane devpatiyon ke chhayaroop ke kaaran na hokar apana nijee tha or inaki puja apni swatantra shakti ke kaaran hoti thi
 These were initially goddesses of different powers, but later in the akkadi-babuli period, usually two and a half thousand years before Christ, their combined power was named 'ishtar'
 ishtar kaa pracheenatam akkadi rup 'ash dar' tha jo us bhashaa ke abhilekhon main miltaa he
 In Akkadi, the meaning of this was translated and became the same as that of the ancient Sumerii Iannanna or Innini - Goddess of heaven
 ' sumeri sabhyataa main yah matrudevi sarvatha kumari thi
 In Finiki he got his name 'astarte'
 uskaa sambandh venus grah se hone ke kaaran vahi romanon main prem kii devi venus bani
 Thousands of clay, lime clay and stone sculptures of this mother goddess have been found in ancient Babylonia and Assuria, virtually the whole of Iraq, thereby revealing the dominion of that goddess over that region
 rajasthan ke chaaran kaviyon ne apane geeton ke liye jis saahitiyik style kaa prayog kiya he, use dingal yaa dingal kaha jaataa he
 Apart from the Charan poets, other poets like Prithiraj have also composed in Dingle style
 rajasthan ke bhatta kavi "dingal" kaa aashray na lekar "pingal" main rachana karte rahe hai
 Some scholars consider "dingle" and "rajasthani" to be synonymous with each other, but this view is philosophically flawed
 is tarah dalpati vijay, narpathi naalh, bardaai or nallasinh bhaat kii rachanaaon ko bhi "dingal" sahitya main maan lenaa avaigyaniktaa he

 iskaa matlab he ki prayek dharm ke anuyaayiyon ko dharmapalan kii puri swatantraaa he, basharte ve duusare ke dharm main yaa hamaare rajya ke mul siddhanton main hastkshep na karen
 It means that those who are in minority from the point of view of religion should accept this position
 iskaa yah bhi taatpary he ki bahusankhyak log is drushtikon se iskaa puri tarah se mahatv samajhen, kyonki bahusankhyak hone ke naate or duusare kaarnon se bhi unka prabhaav adhik he
