 Earlier there was no special distinction between manual and accounting work
 parantu aaj ke audyogic yug main pustapaalan tathaa lekhankan donon pruthak kaary ho gayi hai
 Generally, the following tasks fall under the areas of manual, accounting and auditing: pustapaalan- jaisaa ki uparyukt bindu se spasht he, pustapaalan jarnal tathaa khatabahi main vyapaarik saudon ke lekhe karne kii kala he
 Any person with the simple ability to keep accounts can do this work with convenience
 yah kaary yantravat likh dena maatr he
 Accounting- According to the above point, the work of the accountant starts after the work of the bookkeeper
 isi kaaran yah kaha jaataa he ki jahaan se pustapaalan samaapt hota he, vahiin se lekhankan prarambh hota he
 In this area, the work of preparing the final accounts and making necessary errors and corrections comes from taking out the balance
 sankshep main, kaary saransh tathaa vishleshan karne kii prakriya he
 Summary means flat and then its analysis is done by preparing the final accounts

 e dablyoo hanson- sampoorn lekhon kii aisi jaanch ko ankekshan kehete he jinase ki un par vishwaas kiya ja sake tathaa unke dwaara bataaye hue vivaranon par bhi vishwaas kiya ja saken
 In conclusion based on the above definitions- ankekshan kisi vyapaarik sanstha kii hisaab-kitaab kii pustakon kii vishisht evam vivechanaatmak jaanch he, jo ek yogya tathaa nishpaksh vyakti dwaara sanstha se praapt pramankon, prapatron soochnaaon tathaa spashtikarnon kii sahaayta se kii jaati he, jisase ki ankekshak ek nishchit samay ke liye banaaye hue hisaab-kitaab ke sambandh main yah report de sake ki, Institution - The audit of any institution can be done
 swatantra vyakti- ankekshan kaary kisi aise vyakti dwaara hona chahie jiskaa vyapaar athwa sanstha se kisi bhi prakaar kaa sambandh na ho
 Only then a fair investigation is possible
 at: vartmaan main chartered lekhapal kii niyukti kii gai hai
 Form of the investigation- The test conducted by the audit does not only reveal the accuracy related to mathematics, but it is an intelligent unbiased test which shows the absolute accuracy of the calculation
 lekha pustaken- ankekshan main lekha-pustakon kii jaanch hoti he
 The auditor does not have to restrict his field of work to only books, but also has to know other statutory books and various facts
 pramank evam prapatr- lekha pustakon kii jaanch pramankon evam prapatron ke aadhaar par kii jaati he, yadi yah uplabdh na hon to inaki pratilipiyon se pushti kii jaati hai
 Information and Explanation - The basis of the inquiry is the evidence itself, but if the auditor is not satisfied with the memorization certificate, then for verification of the transactions one can ask for information and clarification
 budhimattapurna- ankekshan dwaara kii jane vaali jaanch kaa kaary bahut mahatvapurn he at: is kaary main buddhi evam chaturaai kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo is kaary ke anubhav se praapt hoti he
 Purpose of checking- The purpose of checking the books of accounts is to verify the results of the profit and loss account created in a certain period and the assets and obligations shown in the letter on a certain date and give a certificate on satisfaction
 vastav main ankekshak ko antim khaaton kii jaanch par apni raay prakat kerani hoti he
 Regularity - Under the Indian Companies Act, 1956, some important rules should be kept in mind while creating the company's letter and profit and loss account
 at: company ankekshak ko apni report main likhnaa hota he ki chittha niyamaanukool he athwa nahin
 Period- Auditing is generally done for accounts of one financial year or one accounting year
 yadi ek se adhik varsh ke lekhon kaa ankekshan kiya jaataa he to yah jaanch anusandhan kehalaati he
 Result- After checking the articles, a report has to be given regarding its veracity and appropriateness
 yadi ankekshak kisi baat se asantusht he to iskaa varnan spasht rup se apni report main karata he
 As an accounting imperative, accounting in practical terms is essential to keep the business alive and to gain prestige in the society
 iske liye nimnlikhit tark diye ja sakate hai : In today's era, accurate knowledge of profit or loss from a business is not a concept without accounting
 vyavsaayee kii aarthik sthiti suddadh va aarthik saadhan bahut achche hon, to bhi anya vyavsaayee ke mukaable sasti bechney ke falswaroop bikri adhik ho lekin sirf diwaala nikalne par hi use pataa chalegaa ki usne vastu ko laagat se bhi kam main bech diya he
 There are more transactions in the business, especially where the goods are sold more on credit, it is not possible to remember the names of the debtors, so accounting is mandatory
 ek nishchit avadhi kii samaapti par laabh hua athwa haani
 Accounting is mandatory for this
 vyavsaayik lekha-pustaken yadi sucharu tareeke se rakhi jaayen to chaluvarsh kii aay-vyay yaa laabh-haani kii tulana pichley varshon ke laabh-haani se kii ja sakati he
 Through accounting, the trader gets to know his financial position
 kar-nirdhaaran main lekhon kaa bahut mahatv he
 If the accounts are kept according to the rules then these are very helpful
 ek vyapaaree ko kin-kin vyaktiyon ko kul kitna rupaya dena he, yah soochna lekhankan se hi mil sakati he
 More profit can be made by starting unprofitable actions except for non-profitable actions and if there is a deficiency in efficiency then they can be overcome by knowing their reasons
 yah kaary lekhakarm dwaara hi sambhav he
 If proper books of accounts are kept in a business, then the reputation of that business increases
 lekhankan ke nimnlikhit laabh bhi hai : ACCOUNTING LUXURY AS chote vyapaariyon ke liye ise vilasita mana gaya he kyonki inaki simit aavashyaktaaen hoti hai kintu vartmaan samay main yah purna rup se uchit prathit nahin hoti he
 Auditing as Luxury lagaana he phir bhi hisaab-kitaab main chal-kapat chhipe rah jate he, jo ankekshak uchit chaturaai va saavdhaanee ke baavjood nahin pakad saktaa hai
 Hence the audit is meaningless
 uparokt tathyon ke aadhaar par ham kah sakate hai ki chote-chote vyapaar main ankekshan vilasita he lekin sabhi vyavsaayon ke liye ankekshan ko vilasita kahana galat hoga
 Small organizations where there are one or two employees and the owner of accounting is looked after by a sole trader or partner, so auditing is not necessary, but in big business it is profitable and highly necessary, not luxury
 ankekshan kaa vilasita na hona Enhancing the efficiency of the employees - The efficiency of the employee increases as a result of the audit, because they know that an error can be detected by the auditor if the work is not done properly! karmchaariyon kii kaarykushalta main vruddhi-kushal ankekshan ke falswaroop karmchaariyon apane-apane kaary main daksh ho jate hai kyonki ankekshak samay-samay par apni report main tathaa ankekshan ke dauraan bhi kamiyon ko bataata rahata he va maargdarshan bhi karata rahata he
 Increase in efficiency of managers- When the managers know that the auditor will submit their report on the work done by them, which will be acceptable, they will do their work with full sincerity
 vyavsaay ke vikaas main sahaayak- ankekshit hisaab-kitaab par sabhi vishwaas karte hai tathaa isse vyapaar kii khyaati main vruddhi hoti he tathaa sabhi ore se vyavsaay ko suvidhaayen praapt hoti hai jisase vyavsaay kaa vikaas hota hai
 Decision in case of insolvency possible- If the books of accounts are properly conducted and audited, then the court can help in getting the debt relief order
 ho saktaa he iske abhaav main samay adhik lag jaay
 Assistants in future planning - The managers conduct comparative studies on the basis of the final accounts of several years and see how the efficiency can be increased
 plant evam mashin kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi- laagat lekhon ke ankekshan se yah maaloom hota he ki mashiinon kii kitni kaaryakshmata he tathaa kin-kin kaarnon se mashiinon kii purna kaaryakshmata kaa prayog nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Efficiency can be increased by acquiring information about these reasons
 ankekshan kii anivaaryta Auditing affects efficiency, so it cannot be called luxury
 nimnakint dashaon main yah anivaary hai â€“ Thus it would not be completely true to say that accounting is mandatory and auditing is a luxury
 chote vyapaar main kahin-kahin lekhankan bhi vilasita he jabaki bade vyavsaayon ke liye anivaary hi he
 But still accounting and auditing are two sides of a coin
 yadi lekhankan na ho to ankekshan kiskaa hoga
 And if accounting is alone then it does not have the credibility of its veracity
 truti karnaa maanav swabhaav kaa ek bhaag hai ankekshan kaa pramukh uddeshy bhi ashuddhi va gaban kaa pataa lagaana va unhen rokna hota hai
 Checking of preliminary articles, journal checking, checking of cash balances, checking of balances of accounts, checking of account books of subsidiary books, matching of previous year's floor, finding the amount of difference, to check the auditor's errors Can take action etc
 yadi ankekshak apane kaary main itani saavdhaanee, kushalta evam budhimaani kaa prayog kare jitna ki un paristhitiyon main sammav tha or usne purna praytn kiya ho jo ki trutiyon ko dhund nikaalane hetu param aavashyak tha
 If still unable to detect fraud, the auditor cannot be held liable
 ankekshan kaary kaa arth yah kabhi nahin hota 'ki ankekshak ne ashuddhiyon evam gaban kaa beemaa kar liya he, na hi vah is baat kii garanti detaa he ki samast ashuddhiyon evam gaban ko dhund nikaalega
 He is only expected to do his work with due care and cleverness

 To this end, the auditor follows such procedures to assure that the financial statements give a true and fair picture of the financial position and operating results of an enterprise
 ' The auditor, with his professional experience and decision-making ability, sets certain criteria for investigation, while doing so he cannot be expected to work outside his area of competence

 Limitations are as follows: - siddhanth kaa arth ek sarabhoot tathy, ek aadharbhoot niyam se he
 The principles of audit are such important truths that provide knowledge of the objectives of audit and explain the ways in which these can be met

 This process is known as glycolysis

 Instead, synthesized organisms and bacteria form the basis of the food chain
 ] There is a general belief that animals have evolved from a flagellate eukaryote
 unke nikatatam gyaat sajiv sambandhi hai koeno kashabhiki, colerd kashabhiki jinaki aakaariki vishisht spanjon ke koeno cites ke saamaan he
 Molecular studies place animals in a superfamily group, called opisthokonts, which also include animals from the koeno flagellum, fungi and some small parasitic protists
 pehle jeevashm jo jantuon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, lagbhag 610 million varsh purv, purvacambrian kaal ke ant main prakat hue or ye adiakaran yaa vendian biota kehalaate hai
 But these are difficult to relate to later fossils
 Some may represent the predecessors of modern associations, but they may be distinct groups, and it is also possible that they are not actually animals
 unhen chhod kar, adhiktam gyaat jantu sangh, 542 million varsh purv, cambrian yug ke dauraan, swatah hi prakat hue
 It is still disputed whether this phenomenon, called the Cambrian explosion, represents a sharp divergence between different groups or the changes in conditions that made fossilization possible
 haalaanki kuch puratatvigyaani or bhuvaigyanik bataate hai ki jantu pehle soche jane vaale samay se kaaphi pehle prakat hue, sambhawatah 1 billian varsh purv

 Also at the beginning of the Tonian era, stromatolite decreased about 1 billion years ago

 The discovery, which is very similar to these early fossil marks, has its origins in the present-day giant size single-organism Protista organism Gromia sphaerica, doubting their interpretation as evidence of early animal development
 lambey arase pehle se spanj ko anya praarambhik jantuon se bhinn mana jaataa tha
 As noted above, the complex organization found in most other associations is not found in them, their cells are differentiated, but in most cases not organized into separate tissues
 spanj tane rahit hote hai or aam taur par inke chhidron ke madhyam se jal khinch kar bhojan praapt karte hai
 Archaeocyatha, which have a fused skeleton, may represent a sponge or a different association
 haalaanki, 2008 main 21 vanshon main 150 jeenon kaa ek faillo jinomik adhyayan bataata he ki yah tinophora yaa comb jelly he jo kam se kam un 21 sanghon main jantuo kaa aadhaar banaati he
 The authors believe that sponges â€” or at least the sponges they have discovered â€” are not so primitive, but can instead be simplified secondary
 anya sangho main, tinophora or nideria, jinamein samudri anemon, coral or jelifish shaamil hai, trigyat samamit hote hai, inamen ek hi chhidr se yukt pachan kaksh hota he, jo mukh or guda donon kaa kaam karata he
 Both have distinctly differentiated tissues, but are not organized into organs
 inamen keval do mukhya janan str hote hai, bahya tvak str or antah tvak str, jinke bich main keval koshikaayen bikhri hoti hai
 That is why these animals are sometimes called diploblastic
 chote placosoa samaan hai, lekin un main ek sthaayee pachan kaksh nahin hota he
 The remaining animals form a federal group called the bilateria
 adhiktam bhaag ke liye, ve dwiparshv samamit hote hai or aksar ek vishishtikrut sir hota he jo khaadya angon or samvedi angon se yukt hota he
 The body is tripleblastic, that is, all three reproductive layers are fully developed and tissues form differentiated organs
 pachan kaksh main do chhidr hote hai, ek mukh or ek guda, saath hi ek aantarik deh guha bhi hoti he jo ceylom yaa abhaasi deh guha bhi kehalaati he
 There are exceptions to each of these traits, however - adult echinoderms are radially symmetric and have very simplified physiological structures in typical parasitic animals
 anuvanshik adhyayan nen bailetria ke bheetar sambandh ko lekar hamaare gyaan ko kaaphi had tak badal diya he
 Most belong to two main genealogies: Deuterostomes and Protostomes, including Ecdysozoa, Platyzoa, and Lophotrochozoa
 is ke atirikt, dwiparshvasamamit jeevon ke kuch chote samooh hai jo in mukhya samoohon ke samaksh visarit hote hue prathit hote hai
 These include Aesolomorpha, Rhombozoa and Orthonectida
 aisa mana jaataa he ki mixojoa, ek koshikeey paraseete jinhen mul rup se protogon mana jaataa tha, bailetria se hi viksit hue hai
 Deuterostomes differ in many ways from other bilateria, protostomes
 donon hi maamalon main ek puraa pachan path paaya jaataa he
 However, in the protostome, the initial pore develops in the mouth and the anus develops separately
 duterostome main yah ulat he
 In most protostomes, cells normally fill in the inner part of the gastrula and form the middle reproductive level, this is called Schizosillus development, but in the deuterostome it is formed by the intracellular level of innervation, known as entrosylic pouching
 duterostome main adhar ke bajaay prishthiya tantrika rajju hota he or unke bhrun main bhinn prakaar kaa vidalan hota he
 All this suggests that deuterostomes and protostomes are distinctly federal levels
 duterostome ke pramukh sangh hai, ekainodermanta or cordeta
 The former is radially symmetric and is particularly marine, such as starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers
 duusare vaale main mukhya rup se kasheruki jeev hai jinamein ridh kii haddi pai jaati he
 These include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals
 inke atirikt duterostome main hemicordeta or ekon krimi bhi shaamil hai
 Although they are not currently found predominantly, significant fossil evidence relates to them
 chetognetha yaa tir krimi bhi duterostome ho sakate hai, lekin adhik haal hi main kiye gaye adhyayan protostome ke saath inke saannnidhya ko darshaate hai
 Ecdysozoa are protostomes, which have been named on the basis of a characteristic characteristic of growth by moulting or release

 The nematoda or round worm comes in Ekadisozoa, the second largest animal association

 There are many important parasites

 These groups have a truncated body, which is called virtual body cavity
 protostome ke shesh do samooh kabhi kabhi spirila ke saath rakhe jate hai, kyonki donon main bhrun kaa vikaas sarpil vidalan se hota he
 Platyzoa include the association Platyhelminthes, the flattened worm
 mul rup se inhen sabase aadim prakaar ke dwiparshvi mana jaataa tha, lekin ab aisa mana jaataa he ki ve adhik jatil purvajon se viksit hue hai
 This group includes many parasites, such as the fluke and the lace worm
 chapate krimi aguhiy hote hai, inamen deh guha kaa abhaav hota he, jaisaa ki unke nikatatam sambandhi, sookshm jeev gestrotrica main hota he
 Other associations of Platyzoa consist mostly of microscopic and virtual celiac
 sabase pramukh hai rotiphera yaa rotiphers, jo jaleey vaataavaran main saamaanya hai
 These include Acanthocyphaella or sculp-topped worms, Gnathostomulida, Microbenthozoa, and possibly Cyclophora
 in samoohon main jatil jabade hote hai, jinaki vajah se ye gnethiphera kehalaate hai
 Both groups have long been thought to be closely related, as tricophore larvae are found in both, but Annelida was thought to be much closer to Arthropoda
 kyonki ve donon hi khandit hote hai
 It is generally considered convergent evolution, as there are many morphological and genetic differences between the two associations
 lophotrocojoa main nimertia yaa ribbon krimi, sipunkula bhi shaamil hai or kai sangh jinamein mukh ke chaaron ore pakshmabhika kaa ek pankhaa hota he, lofophor kehalaate hai
 These were traditionally grouped with Lofo forites
 lekin ab aisa prathit hota he ki ve peraphilatic hai, kuch nimertia ke najdiki hai ore kuch molska va enelida ke najdiki hai
 These include Brachiopoda or Lemp shells, which are prominent in fossil records, Entroprocata, Phoronida, and possibly Bryozoa or Moss fauna

 Because they are easy to keep and hybridize, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the nematode Canorhabditis elegans have long been widely studied specimen organisms and were among the first life forms to be genetically sequenced
 ise unke jinom kii bahut adhik apachayit avasthaa ke dwaara sahaj banaaya gaya, lekin yahan do dhar kii talwaar kai jino, introns or linkage lost ke saath he, ye ekadsojoa ke jeev saamaanya rup se jantuon kii utpatti ke bare main hamen thoda bahut sikhaa sakate hai
 The extent of this type of evolution within the ultimate association will be revealed through the genome project of Crustaceans, Annelids, and Mollusca, which is currently progressing

 Other modal organisms related to the animal world include the rat and zebrafish
 arastu ne sajiv duniya ko paudhon or jantuon main vibhajit kiya or iske baad kerolas linius ne pehla padanukramit vargeekaran kiya
 Since then, biologists have been emphasizing on the relationship of development and hence these groups have become somewhat restricted

 The remains of this ancient splendor are still present today in places called Angkorvat, Angkorthom
 kamboj kii pracheen dantakthaon ke anusaar is upnivesh kii neenv 'aryadesh' ke raja kambu swayambhuv ne daali thi
 He came to the country of Kambose under the inspiration of Lord Shiva and with the help of the king of the Naga caste settled here, he established a new kingdom in this wild desert which culminated in the lush, beautiful region with the wonderful magic of Nagraj
 kambu ne nagaraj kii kanya meraa se vivaah kar liya or kambuj rajvansh kii neenv daali
 It is also possible that this colony located in Indochina was also related to Indian Kamboj
 teesri shatee i
 main bharat kii uttar-pashchimi seemaa par basanevo murundon kaa ek rajdoot phunaan pahunchaa tha or sambhavat: kamboj ke ghode apane saath vahaan laayaa tha
 The founder of the first historical dynasty of Kamboj was Shrutavarman who liberated the country of Kamboj from Funan
 iske putr shreshthavarman ne apane naam par shreshthpur naamak rajdhani basaai jiske khandhar laos ke watfu pahari ke paas sthit hai
 Thereafter, Bhavavarman, who belonged to both the Funan and Kambose dynasties, started a new dynasty and settled the capital named Bhavpur in his own name
 bhavavarman tathaa iske bhai mahendravarman ke samay se kamboj kaa vikasyug prarambh hota he
 The old kingdom of Funan was now dilapidated and soon merged into this new turbulent empire

 This majestic king extended the boundaries of the kingdom of Kamboj far and wide
 usne bharat or champa ke saath rajanyik sambandh sthapit kiye or ishanpur naam kii ek nai rajdhani kaa nirmaan kiya
 Ishaanavarman married his daughter to Jagadharma, the king of Champa, whose son Prakashadharma became king of Champa after the death of his father
 isse prathit hota he ki champa is samay kamboj ke raajnneetik prabhaav ke antargat tha
 After Ishanavarman, the names of the kambhoj kings are found in Bhavavarman II and Jayavarman I
 jayavarman ke pashchaat 674 i

 Shortly after, the power of Kamboj began to wane and gradually in the 8th century AD, the Kamboj dominance of the Shalendra kings of Java was established over the country
 8veen sadi i

 He probably called Hiranyadas from India and performed tantric activities for the protection of his kingdom
 is vidvan brahman ne devraj naamak sampradaay kii sthapana kii jo sheeghra hi kamboj kaa rajdharm ban gaya
 Jayavarman made his capital in the cities of Kuti, Hariharalaya and Amarendrapur respectively, making it clear that almost all of the territory of present-day Cambodia was under him and the center of the power of the state gradually moved from east to west and finally the territory of Angkor
 Was established in jayavarman dwitiya ko apane samay main kambujrajendra or uski mahraani ko kambujrajalakshmi naam se abhihit kiya jaataa tha
 From this time, foreign authors of Cambodia's ancient name Kambuj or Kambhoj also started using it

 main kamboj kaa raja rajendravarman tha jiske samay ke kai brihad abhilekh sundar sanskrit kavyastylee main likhe milte hai
 The period up to 1001 AD is significant in the history of Kamboj because during this period the borders of Kamboj touched the southern part of China, Laos was under it and its political influence extended to Syria and northern Malaya
 suryavarman pratham ne praaia: samast syam par kamboj kaa aadhipaty sthapit kar diya or dakshin brahmadesh par bhi akraman kiya
 He was a scholar of literature, justice and grammar and, despite being a Buddhist himself, was a lover and protector of Shaivite and Vaishnava religions
 usne rajacin hone ke samay desh main chale hue grihayuddh ko samaapt kar rajya kii sthiti ko pun: sudrudh karne kaa praytn kiya
 After conquering North Champa, Suryavarman made him a proud kingdom of Kamboj but soon had to give up to King Jaihari Varmana of South Champa
 is samay kamboj main grihayudhon or padosi deshon ke saath anban ke kaaran kaaphi ashaanti rahi
 Once again during the reign of Jayavarman VII, the ancient fame of Kamboj began to unfurl
 usne ek vishaal sena banaai jisamen syam or brahmadesh ke sainik bhi sammilit the
 Jayavarman also tried to conquer Anam by invading him, but due to the constant wars, the military power of the Shani Kambos began to decline, even in 1220 AD, the Kambos had to withdraw from Champa

 The city had a high tower and a 110-meter-wide facade
 isaki lambaai saadhe aath mile ke lagbhag thi
 There were five lion gates of the city park, from which five huge Rajpaths used to go inside the city
 ye rajpath, beyon ke virat hindu mandir ke paas milte the, jo nagar ke madhya main sthit tha
 There were 66,625 persons employed in the temple and 3,400 villages had an income for its expenditure
 is samay ke ek abhilekh se gyaat hota he ki kamboj main 789 mandir tathaa 102 chikitsaalay the or 121 vaahni grih the
 After Jayavarman VII, many sites in the history of Kamboj are not very clear
 13veen sadi main kamboj main sudrudh raajnneetik shakti kaa abhaav tha
 According to some historians, Kamboj refused to assume the suzerainty of the Emperor Kuble Khan of China in the last phase of the 13th century

 In the 14th century, new political power was emerging in the neighboring kingdoms of Kamboj and the Thai people of Siamese and Champa were constantly trying to move towards Kamboj
 parinaam yah hua ki kamboj par do ore se baari dabaav padane laga or vah in donon deshon kii chakki ke paaton ke bich pisane laga
 Gradually, the ancient importance of Kamboj was gone and now this country became an ordinary backward state of Indochina

 In the war between Siamese and the French in 1904â€“41, some of the territory of Cambodia was given to Syam, but after the Second World War, in 1945 AD this part was regained
 is samay cambodia main swatantraaa andolan bhi chal rahaa tha jiske parinamswaroop france ne cambodia ko ek nayaa samvidhan pradaan kiya 
 But this did not satisfy the nationalists there and they forced the French to sign a new samanate in 1949, which allowed them to accept Cambodia's independent political power, but still kept the country under the French Union i went

 With their efforts, Cambodia soon became an independent nation and was elected the first Prime Minister of its country
 kamboj vaastavik arth main bhartiya upnivesh tha
 The religion of the residents there, their culture and civilization, literary traditions, architecture and language - all had an indelible mark of Indianness, whose philosophy is still spontaneous to the audience of Cambos

 For example, only a portion of a huge inscription of Rajendravarman is presented here in which Shiva is worshiped: puraane arab paryatakon ne kamboj ko hindu desh ke naam se thik hi abhihit kiya
 The official language of Kambuj was Sanskrit in ancient times, it was gradually replaced by Pali due to the propagation of Buddhism and even today it remains the main language in the religious region

 amla ek rasinic yogic he, jo jal main ghulkar hydrogen aayan detaa he
 Its ph value is less than 7
0
 johans nicholas bronsted or martin lorie dwaara di gai aadhunik paribhaasha ke anusaar, amla vah rasinic yogic he jo pratikaarak yogic ko hydrogen aayan pradaan karata he
 For example, acetic acid and sulfuric acid
 Acids, solids, liquids or gases can be found in any physical state
 ve shuddh rup main yaa ghol ke rup main rah sakate hai
 The substance or compound in which the properties of acids are found are called
 maanav antra main hydrochloric amla kii adhikta se hone vaali beemaari ko amlata yaa acidity kehete hai
 Acids are substances that are sour in taste when dissolved in water, turn a roly made from turmeric to yellow, and their aqueous solution turns blue litmus paper red
 adhikansh dhaatuon par abhikriya karke hydrogen gas utpann karte hai, or ksharak ko udasin kar dete hai
 Fatty bases are those substances whose solution looks smooth, tastes bitter, turns turmeric red and neutralizes acids
 udasin karne kaa arth he aise padaarth kaa bananaa jisamen na amla ke gun hote hai, na ksharak ke
 While studying the properties of oxygen, Lavazi observed that when the elements like carbon, sulfur and phosphorus are burned in oxygen, the oxides made from them form acids with water
 ve is parinaam par pahunche ki amlon main oxygen rahata he or amlon kii amleeyta kaa kaaran oxygen he
 For this reason, this gas was named "oxygen", which means "acidifier" and for this reason, in the German language, Oxygen is called "sire stuff"
 lavaazie ne hi amlon ko do virgon, acarbonic amalon or carbonic amlon main vibhakt kiya tha
 It was seen that oxides of some elements dissolve in water to form not alkalis but alkalis and some acids do not contain oxygen at all
 bertile ne san 1787 main hydrosienic amla, davy ne san 1810-11 main hydrochloric amla or san 1813 main hydrodic amla kaa avishkaar kiya
 There is no oxygen in any of them
 aage chalakar dekha gaya he ki jo padaarth bilkul sookhe hote hai, unamem koi amleey abhikriya nahin hoti
 Then people divided the acids into two classes, one hydro-acid and the other oxy-acid
 peeche san 1815 main davy ne suzav rakhaa ki amlon kii amleeyta oxygen ke kaaran nahin, varan hydrogen ke kaaran he
 Dulang studied oxalic acid in 1815 and came to the conclusion that there is no difference between oxygenated and non-oxygenated acids
 amlon main koi aisa gun nahin he jise ham amlon kaa vishisht lakshan kah saken
 Common properties have been stated above
 amla or dhaatu kii abhikriya main amla ke anu kaa ek, yaa ek se adhik, hydrogen parmaanu dhaatuon, dhaatuon ke oxidon, hydroxidon athwa carboneton se visthapit ho jaataa he
 There are also some acids that are sweet instead of sour
 aisa ek amla amido-fosphrik amla he
 There are some acids which are not alkaline
 kuch aise bhi kshar hai jinka hydrogen dhaatuon se visthapit ho jaataa he
 Alum is not acid
 isamen visthapit honevaala koi hydrogen bhi nahin he
 But it is sour in taste and alkali in action
 yah nile litmus ko laal bhi kar detaa he
 Similarly sodium bisulfide is sour and alkali
 yah nile litmus ko laal karata he
 It also has displacing hydrogen, but it is not acid
 mithen amla nahin he, par iskaa hydrogen jaste se visthapit ho jaataa he or is prakaar zinc diemethil banataa he jo lavan nahin he
 Therefore, no satisfactory definition of acid has yet been given
 aayan siddhant ke aadhaar par yadi ham amlon kii paribhaasha dena chahen to kah sakate hai ki amlon main hydrogen yanon kaa rahanaa atyaavashyak he
 In 1659, Silvian first differentiated into acids and bases
 rule ne san 1774 main ksharak naam us padaarth ko diya jo amlon ke saath milakar lavan banaata he
 Nowadays, bases are those oxygen-rich substances that are supplemented by acids
 kshar dhaatuon, kshariyamruda dhaatuon or anya dhaatuon ke oxide or ve sabhi vastuen ksharak hai jo amlon ke saath milakar lavan banaati hai
 Initially the base was applied only to metals or oxides of metals that were "bases" or bases of salts
 lavenon ke ksharak aavashyak avyav hai
 Bases are actually substances that combine with acids to form salts and water
 udhaahrant:, zinc oxide salphurik amla ke saath milakar zinc sulphate or jal banaata he
 Dahk soda combines with sulfuric acid to form sodium sulfate and water
 dhaatuon ke oxide saamanyat: ksharak hai
 But there are exceptions to this
 ksharakon main dhaatuon ke oxide or hydraksaide hai, par suvidha ke liye tatwon ke kuch aise samooh bhi rakhe gaye hai jo amlon ke saath milakar bina jal bane hi lavan banaate hai
 Among such bases are ammonia, hydroxylamine and phosphine
 drav ammonia ghul jaataa he par phinolfaileen se koi rang nahin detaa
 Thus, to what extent can it be called base, this thing is doubtful
 yadhyapi upar kii ksharak kii paribhaasha badi asantoshprad he, tathaapi isse acchhee paribhaasha nahin di ja saki he
 Base and base are not synonyms
 sab kshar ksharak hai par sab ksharak kshar nahin hai
 Alkali-metal oxides, such as sodium oxide, dissolve in water to form hydroxides
 ye prabal ksharkeey hote hai
 Alkaline soil metal oxides, such as calcium oxides, are soluble in water and less alkaline
 anya dhaatuon ke oxide jal main ghulte nahin or unke hydraksaide paroksh ritiyon se hi banaae jate hai
 Oxides and hydroxides of metals are basic
 kshar dhaatuon ke oxide jal main sheeghra ghul jate hai
 Oxides of some metals are less soluble in water and oxides of some metals are not soluble even in water
 kuch adhaatuon ke hydride, jaise nitrogen or phosphorus ke hydride bhi bhasma hote hai

 Andorra could until 1993 be considered de facto to have been under dual French and Spanish rule due to the lack of clear division of powers while it was ruled by a Spanish bishop and the French president, according to a treaty
 In 1278, the conflict between the French Count and the Catalan bishop was resolved by the signing of a pareage, which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the Count of Foix and the Bishop of La Seu d'urgell
 The pareage, a feudal institution recognizing the principle of equality of rights shared by two rulers, gave the small state its territory and political form
 Today Andorra is a co-principality with the President of France and the Bishop of Urgell, Spain as co- princes, in a duumvirate

 The state has no firm population as its citizens are only granted citizenship for the duration of service in the state

 The age of the mother and the patient's history of previous miscarriages are two major risk factors
 is tarah ke garbhpaat adhiktar bhrun kii avadhi ke dauraan hote hai

 manastaap yaa manoveekshipti yaa psychosis man kii ek apasaamaanya dasha he jisamen man yah tay nahin kar paata ki kya vaastavik he or kya avastavik 
 Some of the symptoms may be- False belief, and hearing such sound or seeing things which are not heard / seen by ordinary people
 anya lakshan hai- baatcheet main ekarupata na hona, kisi paristhiti ke anuroop jo vyavhaar hona chahie usase alag vyavhaar
 Apart from this, the problem of sleeplessness, tendency to stay away from society, lack of motivation, difficulty in doing your daily activities, etc
 are other symptoms
 manoveekshipti or paagalpan donon shabd asaadhaaran manodasha ke bodhak he, parantu jahaan paagalpan ek saadhaaran prayog kaa shabd he, jiskaa kanoonee upyog bhi kiya jaataa he, vahaan manoveekshipti chikitsashastra kaa shabd he jiskaa chikitsa main vishesh arth he
 a mad person often does not care about his body and work
 uski hifaazat duusare logon ko kerani padati he
 Therefore, if he commits a crime, he is not considered a victim of punishment
 isse miltaa-julata, parantu isse pruthak, arth manoveekshipti kaa he
 In a demented person, from simple abnormalities to absolutely insanity-like behaviors are seen
 kuch manoveekshipt vyakti thodi hi chikitsa se achche ho jate hai
 They live in the society and do not harm the society
 unamem aparaadh kii pravriti nahin rahati
 Conversely, some demented individuals have a strong tendency to crime
 ve apane bhitari man main badale kii bhaavana rakhte hai, jise veikshipt vyavhaaron main prakat karte hai
 There are some deranged people who lack the ability to understand the difference between good and bad behavior
 ve hanste-hanste kisi vyakti kaa galaa ghot de sakate hai, par unhen aisa nahin jaan padataa ki unhone koi jaghanya aparaadh kaa daalaa he
 In this way, dementia involves insanity, but not all demented people can be called insane
 maansik chikitsakon ne manoveekshipti ke pradhanat: do prakaar maane hai : ek sharirajnya or doosraa manojnya
 These are called bio- and functional maneuvers
 yah veikshipti paitruk parampara se praapt hoti he
 In many families it is seen from generation to generation
 kabhi kabhi pita kii or kabhi mata kii purv pidiyon main ise paaya jaataa he
 Sometimes psychosis is not present in the immediate earlier generation, but it is found in a distant ancestor
 kisi vishesh prakaar ke rog ke kaaran jin kii vishisht prakaar kii kshati ho jaati he or jab yahi jin phir se nae sharir ke nirmaan kaa kaaran hota he, tab uski kshati is nae praani main vyakt hoti he
 Just as tuberculosis and syphilis continue to be inherited, similarly body-borne psychosis continues to run traditionally
 is prakaar ke rog kii chikitsa ke liye anek vaigyanik khonjen ho rahi hai, parantu unamem paryaapt safalataa abhi tak nahin mili he
 The second type of psychosis is psychodynamic
 yah veikshipti prabal maansik sangharsh se utpann hoti he
 Psychosis is not mandatory in the ancestors of this type of patient
 ise ham manouvaigyanik manoveekshipti kah sakate hai
 The reason for psychological psychosis lies in a man's own life
 kuch logon main janm se hi snaayu kii durbalata hoti he
 This infirmity does not come from the ancestral tradition, but after the child is conceived
 phir vyakti ke bachapan ke sanskaar uske vikaas ke anukool nahin hote, use anek prakaar kii apriy bhavatmak anubhutiyaan hoti hai
 The thing that confirms a person's life is childhood love and encouragement
 iske abhaav main vyakti kaa vyaktitv sugathit or drudh nahin ho paata, atev jab praudh jivan main use bhavatmak ghatnaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, tab vah aatmavishvaas kha detaa he
 Sometimes when pampered in childhood, extraordinary behavior arises in humans
 adhik laad pyaar kii avasthaa main manushya aatmaniyantran kii shakti usee prakaar praapt nahin kar paata jis prakaar vah adhik taadna kii sthiti main durbal man kaa bana rahata he
 When such a person encounters a cruel environment, then a state of psychosis arises in him
 manoveekshipti or sanak main bahut kuch samanta he, parantu donon main bhed bhi he
 As far as their cause is concerned, both of them have the same cause, but both have extraordinary and understandable amounts of behavior
 sanakee manushya ke vishesh vyavhaar hi asaadhaaran hote hai
 Almost all behavior of a deranged person is extraordinary
 vah kabhi kabhi hi saamaanya sthiti main aata he, par sanakee manushya samaaj main apana jivan thik se chalaata rahata he
 Others in the society may call him a freak, a freak, but he does his work mostly properly
 sanakee, athwa unmadagrast, vyakti thode samay hi asaadhaaran rahata he, kintu veikshipti sab samay asaadhaaran rahata he
 The crazy man sometimes gets to know about the paranormal
 vah apane aapako isse mukt karne kii cheshtaa bhi karata he or nirantar praytn karne se vah apni asaadhaaranta se mukt bhi ho jaataa he
 a deranged person does not have this ability
 jivan main vah apane aapako sanbhaal bhi nahin saktaa
 Others have to take care of him
 manoveekshipti kaa praathmik vargeekaran shaareerik or manovaigyanik rup main pehle kiya gaya he, parantu inkaa vargeekaran duusare prakaar se bhi kiya jaataa he
 Some psychics consider themselves very big people
 unhen kabhi vichaar aata he ki ve kisi devi devtaa kii krupa se kuch aisi alokik shaktiyaan praapt kar chuke hai, jisase ve jo bhi ichha karen vahi purna ho jaaegi
 Those who become deranged while doing Yog Sadhana fall in this category
 is prakaar ke manoveekshipt ahamkaari veikshipt yaa sanvibhramvat yaa paranaid kahe jate hai
 Their ego keeps on increasing, but it does not become a reason for their happiness but it becomes a cause of sorrow
 uske man main yah vichaar aata he ki samaaj ke duusare log unke viruddh sadaiv shadyantr karte rahete hai
 Because of this, they are unable to achieve the goal of their greatness
 atev ve apane aas paas ke logon ko shatru ke rup main dekhne lagate hai
 Such people think that there are detectives of some enemy around them, who are trying to bring them down
 ve kabhi kabhi duusare logon par ghaatak prahaar bhi kar dete hai
 According to Dadra Freud, these people have a maladjustment since childhood, which arises due to the affectionate environment of the home and the growth of homosexual love and subsequent suppression
 sanvibhramvat rogi main uchit aatmaheenata kii bhaavana rahati he
 Psychosis is different from paranoia and vice versa
 vishadveikshipti kaa rogi apane aapako sadaa dayaneey avasthaa main sochataa he
 He finds an atmosphere of sorrow all around him
 vah apane jivan ko hi vyarth samajhataa he
 He sees the mere pity of human beings in a pathetic life
 1 In his view, the catastrophe of the world is going to happen very quickly and it is only good for the catastrophe
 vah apane sabhi sambandhiyon or pariwaron kaa nikat bhavishya main nishchit vinaash dekhtaa he
 Where the patient of paranoia is talkative and boastful, there is no want to talk to anyone with an apocryphal
 use kisi se milane julne, khelkud main bhaag lene, kisi sudanr drishy ko dekhne kii ichha hi nahin hoti
 He finds the whole world uninteresting
 vah nahaane dhone, tathaa hajaamat banane ko vyarth samajhataa he
 Even without insisting on the other, he does not even eat
 kabhi kabhi vah upwas kaa itnaa aagrah karata he ki uske munh main nalee daalkar jabardastee doodh pilaayaa jaataa he, taaki vah mar na jaay
 The third type of psychosis is euphoria-sadism-psychosis
 ve baari-baari se ullas or vishaad kii manodasha main rahete hai
 In the state of euphoria, he becomes extremely fickle, runs a lot here, talks to many people, puts in various tasks and laughs a lot
 iske pratikul aacharan vishaad kii avasthaa main hota he
 The mood of these deranged is not so extraordinary that they cannot be treated
 maansik rogon main manodashaon kaa badalte rahanaa, chaahe manodasha kitni hi asaadhaaran kyon na ho, rogi ke liye kalyansuchak he
 Unlike the above three types of moods, there is a complex psychosis called psychodynamics
 is manodasha main manushya ko apane vyaktitv kaa kuch gyaan hi nahin rah jaataa
 There is neither a question of gaiety nor gloom in his life
 atev is manodasha ko doosraa bachapan kaha ja saktaa he
 On coming in this mood, the patient has no power to handle himself
 vah malmutra ke nity kaary bhi nahin kar paata
 He makes excrement on the bed itself
 uske hansane or rone main koi vichaar hi nahin rahata
 No estimate can be made about what time he will do it
 do chaar minute tarkyukt baaten karte hue vah koi aisi baat kah saktaa he jo bilkul anargal ho
 He can strangle the child standing in front of him while laughing
 manoveekshipti ashaant maansik rogon main gini gai he
 Therefore, when someone suffers from any of the above types of psychosis, then it is necessary to keep it in mental hospitals
 chikitsaalay se baahar rahane par manoveekshipti dusron ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to keep them separate from the general public
 chikitsaalayon main inkaa upachaar praaia: neend laanevaali dawaaiyon, athwa behoshee laanevaale injectionon, ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Here, they are being treated by electric shaking for 30-40 years
 in sabhi prakaar ke upachaaron se kuch veikshiptiyon ko laabh hota he, parantu abhi tak manoveekshipti kii koi achook upachaarvidhi khoji nahin ja saki he
 Psychological treatment of psychosis is not possible according to Dr
 Freud's statement
 duusare manovaigyanikon ke anusaar sabhi prakaar kii duusari maansik chikitsaayen safal hone par bhi, bina manovaigyanik upachaar hue rogi ko sthaayee laabh nahin hota
 Therefore, sleep producing and unconsciousness drugs and electric shocks do not provide permanent benefit in psychosis
 inke hone par bhi manovaigyanik upachaar kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Psychological treatment aims at catharsis of proper ill effects and establishment of mental integration
 jeev vigyaan main, dwipad namakaran prajatiyon ke namakaran kii ek aupchaarik pranali he
 a Swedish biologist named Carl Linnaeus first chose to use the naming system of these two names
 unhone iske liye pehla naam vansh kaa or doosraa prajati vishesh kaa vishisht naam ko chunaa tha
 For example, the offspring of a human is Homo while its specific name is Sapiens, thus the binomial or scientific name of the human is Homo sapiens
 roman lipi me likhte samay dono naamon me se vansh ke naam kaa pehla akshar bada hota he jabaki visisth naam kaa pehla akshar chota hi hota he
 If there was no classification of flora and fauna, it would be easy to imagine how complex it would have been to study them today
 aaj jeev vigyaan ho yaa phir vanaspati vigyaan donon hi vishyon main jeevon or vanaspatiyon kaa adhyayan vargeekaran ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Carl Linnaeus was a highly talented scientist of the classification system giving information about species, lineages, scientific names of animals and plants
 aaj jantu vigyaan main jo bhi kuch he, usamen vargeekaran kii adwitiya bhoomika he-iske bina is kshetra main vrahatar gyaan sambhav nahin tha
 The classification system given by Linnaeus proved to be very helpful in the medical world as well and medicalists managed to make many discoveries on the basis of classification of fauna and plants
 aaj ped-paudhon ko samajhane kaa kaam vargeekaran ke jariye hi kiya jaataa he - vargeekaran pranali se hi vanaspatiyon kii prajati, kul or vaigyanik naam ke bare main pataa chalata he

 sicks feet under kii antim shrinkhalaa ke baad, oktober 2005 main, ball ne network kii mul programing ko viksit or nirmit karne ke liye echbio ke saath ek do-varshiya qaraar par hastakshar kiya
 True Blood became the first project of the deal, after Ball's acquaintance with Charlene Harris's Southern Vampire Mystery books
 One day, Ball, who initially turned to Barnes and Noble's pages for a dental appointment, reached the first episode of Harris' series called Dead Antil Dark
 nimnlikhit pravishtiyon ko padhane main unhen bahut majaa aayaa or " drushtikon ko televijan main laane" main unki dilchaspee ho gai
 However, Harris already had two other conversion options for these books
 unhone kaha ki unhone unke saath kaam karne kaa vikalp chunaa he, haalanki, kyonki " sachmuch mujhe 'hasil' kar liya
 Similarly, he persuaded me to go with him
 maine bas yahi mahasoos kiya ki unhen mere dwaara in pustakon ke saath kiye ja rahe kaamon kii samaj thi

 It was decided to start
 tru blad kii emi-manonith sheershak sikvence kaa nirmaan digital kichan naamak ek production studio ne kiya tha jisane sicks feet under ke sheershak sikvence or shotime ke dextor kaa bhi nirmaan kiya tha
 Primarily composed of depictions of the program's Deep South setting, the sequence is performed in "bad Things" by Jess Everett
 ' Reflectively, this sequence around the concept of a "prostitute in the house of prayer" by combining digital images of sex, violence and religion and displaying them from the perspective of "a supernatural, predatory creature looking at mankind from the shadows"
 Elected to build

 Accordingly, several frames of some shots were cut off to create a tense feeling in these movements, while other shots were displayed as normal gradually
 vyaktigat frem ko bhi khun kii buundon ke saath chhalakaaya gaya
 Although the transitions of this sequence were constructed differently, they were constructed with the help of a polaroid transfer technique
 ek shot ke antim frem or duusare shot ke pehle frem ko ek single polaroid photo ke rup main liya gaya tha, jise baad main imlshan or baking main vibhajit kar diya gaya tha
 The emulsion was then filmed for additional separation by chemicals and those shots of this separation were added back to the final edit
