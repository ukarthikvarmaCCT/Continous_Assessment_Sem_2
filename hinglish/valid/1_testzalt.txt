 However, Gambit intervenes in the fight so that Victor escapes
 a scuffle goes on between Logan and Gambit, with Logan defeating Gambit and subduing him

 logaan victor ko ek barbar ladaai main haraa detaa he or lagbhag jaan se maar daalata he lekin jab kaayla use uski maanavtaa kii yaad dilaati he tab vah ruuk jaataa he

 muktak kavy yaa kavita kaa vah prakaar he jisamen prabandhakiyata na ho
 In this, the said matter in one verse does not have any relation or relevance to what is said in the other verse
 kabir evam rahim ke dohe; mirabai ke padya aadi sab muktak rachanaaen hai
 Most of the Muktak Kavyas were composed in the Hindi language
 muktak shabd kaa arth he ‘apane aap main sampoorn’ athwa ‘anya nirpeksh vastu’ hona
 at: muktak kavy kii vah vidha he jisamen katha kaa koi purvapar sambandh nahin hota
 prayek chand apane aap main purnat: swatantra or sampoorn arth dene vaala hota he
 In the Sanskrit poetry tradition, the word Muktak was first introduced by Anandvardhan
 It cannot be assumed that no one had knowledge of this direction of poetry before
 Acharya Dandi was acquainted with the name Muktak not as a right but an undefined poem
 Defining Muktak in 'agnipuran' said that: ”muktakan shloke evaikshchamatkaaraksham: satam” That is, the only one who has the ability to perform miracles is called Muktak
 Rajashekhar has also discussed the name Muktak
 Giving importance to Rasa, Anandvardhan said in relation to Muktak: ”tatra muktakeshu rasabandhabhiniveshin: kave: tadashrayamauchityam” That is, the abhinivesh or prestige of the rasa in Muktakas is the administrator of his bond and it is justified by the poet to take shelter of the same
 hemachandracharya ne muktak shabd ke sthaan par muktkaadi shabd kaa prayog kiya
 unhone uskaa lakshan dandi kii parampara main dete hue kaha ki jo anibaddh hon, ve muktadi hai
 In the modern era, Acharya Ramchandra Shukla of Hindi considered Muktak
 According to him: muktak main prabandh ke samaan ras kii dhara nahin rahati, jisamen katha-prasang kii paristhiti main apane ko bhuulaa hua pathak magn ho jaataa he or hriday main ek sthaayee prabhaav grahan karata he
 isamen to ras ke aise chhinte padate hai, jinamein hriday-kalika thodi der ke liye khil uthati he
 yadi prabandh ek vistrut vanasthali he, to muktak ek chunaa hua guladasta he
 isi se yah samaajon ke liye adhik upyukt hota he
 isamen uttarottar drishyon dwaara sangathit purna jivan yaa uske kisi purna ang kaa pradarshan nahin hota, balki ek romantic khand-drishy is prakaar sahasaa saamne laa diya jaataa he ki pathak yaa shrota kuch kshanon ke liye mantrmugdh sa ho jaataa he
 iske liye kavi ko manoram vastuon or vyapaaron kaa ek chota stavak kalpit karke unhen atyant sankshipt or shashakt bhashaa main pradarshit karnaa padataa he
 Acharya Shukla had said that the free power of language and the power of imagination was necessary for Muktak elsewhere
 Impressed by that, Govind Trigunayat presented the following definition: meri samaj main muktak us rachana ko kehete hai jisamen prabandhatv kaa abhaav hote hue bhi kavi apni kalpana kii samaahaar shakti or bhashaa kii samaaj shakti ke sahare kisi ek romantic drishy, paristhiti, ghatana yaa vastu kaa aisa chitratmak evam bhavpurn varnan prastut karata he, jisase pathakon ko prabandh jaisaa anand aane lagata he
 Actually this definition is flawed
 It is not appropriate to say enjoyment like management
 In such a situation, the following definition of Muktak is also given: muktak kavy kii vah vidha he jisamen katha kaa purvapar sambandh na hote hue bhi twarit gati se saadhaaraneekaran karne kii kshamta hoti he
 In my view, the definition of Acharya Ramchandra Shukla is sufficient
 Ultimately, it can be called a chosen bouquet
