 It is usually not the case that the name of a country should be of the caste settled in that country and the same name should also be of the language used by that caste
 sinhal dweep kii yah visheshta he ki usamen basane vaali jati bhi "sinhal" kehalaati chali ai he or us jati dwaara vyavahrut hone vaali bhashaa bhi "sinhal"
 Like the scripts of many Indian languages, the Sinhala language script is also a modified version of the Brahmi script and as Devanagari is the alphabet of all Indian languages, in addition to the Urdu alphabet, Devanagari is also the alphabet of the Sinhala language
 sinhal bhashaa ko do rup maanya hai - shuddh sinhal tathaa mishrit sinhal Only thirty-two letters are valid for Shudh Sinhala- sinhal ke pracheenatam vyakaran granth sidatsangra ) kaa mat he ki ji tathaa i -- a, tathaa aa kii hi maatra vruddhi vaali matraayen hai
 The present mixed Sinhala has not only enriched its alphabet with the letters of the Pali alphabet, but has also adopted all those which were more in the Sanskrit alphabet

 Eighteen letters are considered "swara" and the remaining thirty-six letters are consonants

 Only ten types of treaties are considered in pure Sinhala
 kintu aadhunik sinhal main sanskrit shabdon kii sandhi athwa sandhichchhed sanskrit vyakaranon ke niyamon ke hi anusaar kiya jaataa he
 The group terms of "monosyllabic" or "anaxaksharas", like Sanskrit, are divided into four parts - Namay, Eminent, Prefix and Nipat
 sinhal main hindi kii hi tarah do vachan hote hai - "ekvachan" tathaa "bahuvachan"
 There is no additional "dualism" like Sanskrit
 is "ekvachan" tathaa "bahuvachan" ke bhed ko sankhya bhed kehete hai
 Just as "hindi" and "sinhala" are equated with "vow", similarly we can say that Hindi and pure Sinhala are also synonymous with "gender"

 These eight types of verbs are considered in Sinhala - sinhal bhashaa bolne-chaalane ke samay hamaari bhojpuri aadi boliyon kii tarah pratyayon kii drushti se bahut hi aasaan he, kintu likhane-padhane main utani hi duruh
 In speech and speech, i go through the verb only, xxwrep 5 go, etc

 The Sinhala language, which is similar to more than one language of North India, has developed from the language of those inscriptions which BC
 Available continuously since the second third century
 bhagwaan buddha ke parinirvana ke do sau varsh baad ashokaputra mahendra sinhal dweep pahunche, to "mahavansh" ke anusaar unhone sinhal dweep ke logon ko dweep bhashaa main hi upadesh diya tha
 The tradition that Mahamati Mahendra brought with him was "oral"
 vah parampara yaa to buddha ke samay kii "magadhi" rahi hogi, yaa unke do sau varsh baad kii koi aisi "praakrit" jise mahendra sthavir swayan bolte rahe honge

 ek uttal chaturbhuj ABCD jisamen bhujaayen a = AB, b = BC, c = CD and d = DA hai, kaa kshetrafal gyaat karne ke liye vibhinn saamaanya sutara hai
 Trigonometric formulas kisi chaturbhuj kaa kshetrafal k { \ displaystyle K}, trikoshmetiya padon main nimna prakaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he- k = 1 2 pq ⋅ sin ⁡ θ, { \ displaystyle k = { \ tfrac {1} {2}} pq \ cdot \ sin \ theta,} jahaan p { \ displaystyle p} or q { \ displaystyle q} vikarnon kii lambaaiyaan hai or unke bich kone θ { \ displaystyle \ theta } he
 The area of a quadrilateral can also be expressed in terms of its diagonals
 k = m n ⋅ sin ⁡ φ, { \ displaystyle K=mn \ cdot \ sin \ varphi ,} Where m { \ displaystyle m} and n { \ displaystyle n} are the lengths of the quadrilateral of the quadrilateral and the angle between them is φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi}

 The formula for another area in the positions of the sides and angles, where the angle c { \ displaystyle C}, the middle of the arms b and c, and the angle a { \ displaystyle A}, is the angle between the arms a and d
 k = 1 2 a d ⋅ sin ⁡ a + 1 2 b c ⋅ sin ⁡ c 
 { \ displaystyle K={ \ tfrac {1}{2}}ad \ cdot \ sin {A}+{ \ tfrac {1}{2}}bc \ cdot \ sin {C}
} For a cyclic quadrilateral, the formula is k = 1 2 sin ⁡ a 
 { \ displaystyle K={ \ tfrac {1}{2}} \ sin {A}
} For a parallelogram, this formula is k = a b ⋅ sin ⁡ a 
 { \ displaystyle K=ab \ cdot \ sin {A}
} Alternatively, we can write the formula of the area in terms of the angle θ between the sides and diagonals of the quadrilateral as follows: k = | tan ⁡ θ | 4 ⋅ | a 2 + c 2 − b 2 − d 2 | 
 { \ displaystyle K={ \ frac {| \ tan \ theta |}{4}} \ cdot \ left|a^{2}+c^{2}-b^{2}-d^{2} \ right|
} For a parallelogram, this formula is k = 1 2 | tan ⁡ θ | ⋅ | a 2 − b 2 | 
 { \ displaystyle K={ \ tfrac {1}{2}}| \ tan \ theta | \ cdot \ left|a^{2}-b^{2} \ right|
} Another formula for the area of a quadrilateral with sides a, b, c, d { \ displaystyle a, b, c, d} is- k = 1 4 − 4 x 2 ) − 4 x 2 ) sin ⁡ φ { \ displaystyle K={ \ tfrac {1}{4}}{ \ sqrt {-4x^{2})-4x^{2})}} \ sin { \ varphi }} Where x { \ displaystyle x} is the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals and φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi} is the angle between the diagonals

 Non trigonometric formulas nimnlikhit donon sutara bhujaaon a, b, c, d, ardhparimaap s tathaa vikarnon p va q ke padon main kshetrafal vyakt karte hai- k = - 1 4, { \ displaystyle k = { \ sqrt {- { \ tfrac {1} {4 xxrep 5 } ,} k = 1 4 4 p 2 q 2 − 2 
 { \ displaystyle K={ \ tfrac {1}{4}}{ \ sqrt {4p^{2}q^{2}- \ left^{2}}}
} The formula for area can also be expressed in terms of diagonals m, n and diagonals p, q - k = 1 2 , { \ displaystyle K={ \ tfrac {1}{2}}{ \ sqrt {}},} k = 1 2 p 2 q 2 - 2
 { \ displaystyle k = { \ tfrac {1} {2}} { \ sqrt {p ^ {2} q ^ {2} - ^ {2}}}
} vastav main, kshetrafal ke liye m, n, p tathaa q main se koi teen maan hi paryaapt hai kyonki kisi chaturbhuj main ye chaaron maan nimna prakaar sambandhit hote hai- p 2 + q 2 = 2 
 { \ displaystyle p^{2}+q^{2}=2
} Therefore, by placing the value of any three in this formula, the value of the fourth variable can be easily obtained
 tab, teen kinhin padon main chaturbhuj ke kshetrafal kaa sutara nimna he- k = 1 2 ⋅, { \ displaystyle k = { \ tfrac {1} {2}} { \ sqrt { \ cdot}},} k = 1 4 ⋅ , { \ displaystyle K={ \ tfrac {1}{4}}{ \ sqrt { \ cdot }},} Vector formula kisi chaturbhuj ABCD kaa kshetrafal, sadishon kaa prayog karke praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Let vector AC and BD are diagonals from a to c and b to d respectively
 tab chaturbhuj kaa kshetrafal nimna hoga: k = 1 2 | AC × BD |, { \ displaystyle k = { \ tfrac {1} {2}} | \ mathbf {AC} \ times \ mathbf {BD} |,} jo sadishon AC or BD ke sadish gunan ke pariman kaa aadha he
 In two-dimensional Euclidean geometry, by expressing vector AC as a free vector in the Cartesian plane and vector BD, it can be written as: k = 1 2 | x 1 y 2 − x 2 y 1 | 
 { \ displaystyle K={ \ tfrac {1}{2}}|x_{1}y_{2}-x_{2}y_{1}|

 { \ displaystyle p^{2}q^{2}=a^{2}c^{2}+b^{2}d^{2}-2abcd \ cos {}
} This relation can be considered as the cosine rule for quadrilaterals
 chakree chaturbhuj main, jahaan a + c = 180°, yah sutara p q = a c + b d { \ displaystyle pq=ac+bd} hota he
 Since cos ≥ −1, it also gives evidence of Ptolemy's inequality

 After the defeat of Napoleon, the entire system of busy Europe and various opposing principles organized a conference in Vienna, the capital of Austria in 1815, in order to compromise it is known as the Vienna Congress
 nepolian ne apni vidhwans kaari yudhon se sampurna europe ko dhwast kar diya
 Therefore, this Congress was organized with the aim of crushing his power

 Congress problem vienna kangras ke saamne anek prakaar kii samasyaayen thi
 The European map underwent considerable changes due to the First Napoleonic Wars
 vienna congress ke samaksh in rajyon kii purnsthapana kaa prashn tha duusari samasya krantikari bhaavana kaa daman- karnaa tha
 The question of the church was also a big problem
 vienna ke sadsy carch ke prabhaav ko phir se sthapit karnaa chaahate the
 The fourth problem was to eliminate the possibility of war so that no powerful person like Napoleon could be born again
 vijit rashtron ko puraskrit karnaa bhi ek anya samasya thi
 Principles and objectives of Vienna Congress- uparyukt samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye vienna congress ke kuch siddhant the jo is prakaar he
 Principle of balance of power iskaa pramukh siddhant shakti santulan tha arthath koi desh itnaa shaktishaalee na ban paae kii vah dusron ke liye khatarnaak ban jaae is liye france par pratibandh lagane ke liye holend sweetsraland, baberia tathaa serdinaya kaa vistaar kiya gaya
 France was surrounded by strong states from all sides
 isi tarah germany ko itnaa shaktishaalee banaaya gaya ki prasha sar nahin uthaa sake
 Austria was established in Italy, thus attempting to establish a balance of power
 taaki sampurna europe main shakti shanti bani rahe
 Principle of validity is siddhant ke aadhaar par 1789 ke europea maanchitr ko aadaar sweekaar kar vibhinn europea rajyon kii seemaa- nirdhaaran kaa praytn kiya gaya
 States like Holland, Purtigal, Naples, and Italy were returned to many old dynasties
 kshati- purti kaa siddhant- According to this theory, the countries which were destroyed by Napoleon and who fought against him
 unki kshati- purti karnaa or unhen puraskrit karnaa sweekaar kiya gaya
 The countries that supported Napoleon
 unhen dand diya gaya gaya tha
 Strengthening Frontier States against France - Its fourth principle should be to strengthen the frontier states against France so that France cannot dissolve international power
 uparyukt siddhanton ke atirikt iske anya siddhant bhi the
 Peace- To maintain the agreement, there must be power behind it
 at: england, austria, rus or prasha ne chatusutreey sandhi kii isi siddhant ke falswarup europea vyavastha kii utpatti hui
 Decision and territorial system of Vienna Congress- isane jo pradeshik vyavastha kii uske nimnlikhit uddeshy the
 Countries that took part in defeating Napoleon should be rewarded and those who were defeated should be punished
 europe main kranti se pehle kii vyavastha lagu kiya jaae
 So that European system can be built and peace and security can be maintained
 nepolayan ne jin rajyon ko france main shaamil kiya tha unhen chin liya gaya
 And the ancient dynasty was reestablished in France
 england ko aupniveshik or vyapaarik laabh hue
 The islands of Malta, Saint, Luciana, Mauritius were given from France to England
 prasha ko bhi laabh hua use uttari sexni, salahapel evam trile ke pradesh die gaye falat: uskaa rajya dugunna bad gaya or dakshini germany main uskaa prabhaav kaayam ho gaya
 Belgium was incorporated into Holland and the British dynasty was re-established there
 austria ko italy ke belaysia tata lombrardi ke pradesh die gaye
 Thus his influence in Central Europe was established and Metternak succeeded in his objective
 rus ko warsaw tathaa vesarevig mila
 As a result, it expanded considerably in Western Europe
 italy ko chote- chote rajyon main baantkar use vahaan ke pracheen shaskaon ko de diya gaya or italy main austria kaa prabhaav sthapit kiya gaya
 Poland ceased to exist
 rus, prasha or austria ne use aapas main baant liya

 Apart from this, the Congress did many other things which made the practice of slavery immoral

 To maintain European peace in the future, an international institution was established called the European system
 vienna congress ke kaaryon kaa mulyankan- The Vienna Congress began with the declaration of high ideals and objectives
 lekin uskaa uddeshy puraa nahin ho sakaa tha
 His manner of functioning was faulty
 sabhi raashtra apni swaarth siddhi main lage the
 Hence, it failed to solve the problems
 vienna sammelan kaa kaarykram swaarth parata par aadhaarit tha
 Its members expected moral principles
 is liye iske nirnay asthaayee anirthak sabit hue
 It did not make any effort in the new construction of Europe to fulfill the wishes of the people and to establish a permanent system
 isane sirf shaktisantulan ke siddhant ke aadhaar par rashtriya seemaa kaa nirdhaaran kiya kiya lekin lokapriy bhaavana ko koi mahatv nadeen diya
 The second allegation is that it left some tasks unfinished and did not address certain problems such as signing a treaty to protect European peace but it could not
 kuch itihaaskaaron ne vienna congress ko pratikrayavaadi kaha he
 There was no cost to the national sentiment for this, it is also alleged that the interests of small nations were neglected to protect the interests of big nations
 uparyukt aaropon ke baavjud yah sweekaar karnaa padegaa ki vienna main raajnneetik sanyam or doordarshta se kaam liya gaya tha
 It did an important work towards the unification of Germany and Italy
 itnaa hi nahin isamen das pratha vayapaarik swatantraaa aadi par bhi vichaar kiya gaya
 It did important work towards destroying the anarchy of the states
 isane antarashtriya samvidhan kaa bhi nirmaan kiya
 As a result of its actions, peace remained in Europe for 40 years
 pehali baar antarrashtriya vishyon par baat- chit karne ke liye baithak bulaai gai thi
 And it organized the European system, we can call it the first international organization
 yah bahut badi uplabdhi thi
 In order to achieve the above objectives and goals, Vienna Congress made some principles which were as follows: england ke aupniveshik samrajya main vruddhi kii gai
 He got the islands of Malta, Eligoland etc
 and the islands of Tobago, Mauritius and St
 Lucia in France and Trinidad regions from Spain
 france kii simaaen vahi nishchit kii gai jo kranti se purv kii thi
 After the Revolution period, all areas were taken away from France
 yuddh harjane ke rup main 70 karod fairunk kii raashi kii maang kii gai
 Powerful nations were created from the border areas of France so that in the future France could not disturb the peace of the continent
 france ke rajsinghaasana par punah burvo vansh ke lui 18wein ko baitha diya gaya
 The Holy Roman Empire existed before Napoleon in Germany
 nepolian ne use samaapt kar rin sangh kaa gathan kiya or vahaan rashtrawaad kaa prasar hua
 The Vienna Congress was determined to stop the spread of this nationality
 atah vahaan ek dhilaa-dhaala sangh banaaya gaya jiskaa adhyaksh austria kaa samraat francis bana
 Austria was given the territories of Venice and Lombardy in Italy
 poland se dakshin valasia bhi praapt hua
 Thus Austria regained lost power and prestige
 italy ko anek chote-chote rajyon main vibhakt kar diya gaya
 Italy became, in Maternick's words, only a geographical expression
 is prakaar italy par austria kaa prabhaav sthapit kiya gaya
 In Vienna Congress, slavery was opposed
 kangeras ne shanti banaae rakhane ke liye ek antarrashtriya sanstha kaa nirmaan kiya jise 'europea vyavastha' kaha ja jaataa he
 For the first time the International Constitution was created
 iske dwaara nadiyon main jahaajon kaa avaagaman, samudr kaa upyog tathaa rashtron ke bich parsparik vyavhaar ke muddon ko vyakhyayit kiya gaya
 The main achievement of the Vienna Congress was that it established peace in Europe for nearly 40 years, which Europeans needed most at that time
 vienna kangeras ne antarrashtriya str par shanti sthapit karne kii koshish kii tathaa europea vyavastha kii sthapana kar pratham antarrashtriya sanghathan kii sthapana kii jisaki aadharshila par aage chalakar rashtrasang va sanyukt rashtrasang kaa nirmaan hua
 France was treated fairly fairly in the Vienna Congress and was represented in the Congress despite being a defeated power, while defeated Germany was not represented in the Treaty of Versailles after World War I, and strict provisions of the treaty were imposed on it
 
 nishkarshtah kah sakate hai ki vienna kangeras ne tatkaalik rup se europe main shanti sthapit kii
 Take positive steps like dealing softly with France

 At that time the British kingdom had reached the Yamuna and the Phulkians, the king of Egypt, began to assume the dominion of the British state
 angrejon ne ranjitsingh ko is kaary se manaa kiya
 Ranjitsingh did not think it right to fight the British and made a pact that we would not extend our kingdom in front of Sutlej
 ranjitsingh ne francisi sainikon ko bulaakar, uski sainik kaman main apni sena ko vilayati dhang par taiyaar kiya
 Now he started attacking the southern, western and northern parts of Punjab and in ten years extended his kingdom to Multan, Peshawar and Kashmir
 ranjitsingh ne peshawar ko apane adhikaar main avashya kar liya tha, kintu us soobe par purna adhikaar karne ke liye use kai varshon tak kadaa sangharsh karnaa padaa tha
 He became the lord of the whole of Punjab; And he did not face the intervention of the British
 parantu jis samay angrejon ne napolian kii senaaon ke viruddh sikhon se sahaayta maangi thi, unhen praapt na hui
 Ranjitsinh changed the kingdom of Peshawar in 1808 AD to the name of his ambitious mother-in-law Sadakore
 kyonki yah angrejon kii agent mahila thi
 Ranjitsingh, after quarreling with his ill-fated mother-in-law, imprisoned him and took control of Hvdni's stronghold

 Therefore, he started preparations silently, yet in 1809 AD, he made a treaty with Lord Minto

 Due to the above treaty, the Afghan state of Punjab and Afghanistan were able to terrorize it to some extent

 On hearing of Shah Mahmud's invasion of Kabul in 1811 AD and knowing that Mahmud intended to attack the ruler of Kashmir, he attacked Kashmir so that it would be possible for Mahmud to return and find his friendship

 Keeping this in mind, the British themselves organized a threesome with Ranjitsinh and Shahshuja

 It is about the year 1812
 punjab par maharaja ranjit singh kaa ecchhatra rajya tha
 At that time, Maharaja Ranjit Singh started a campaign to free Kashmir from the clutches of Atamohammad, the Subedar of Kashmir
 is abhiyaan se bhaybheet hokar atamohammad kashmir chhodkar bhaag gaya
 There was another reason behind the Kashmir campaign
 atamohammad ne mahmud shah dwaara parajeet shahshuja ko shergarh ke kile main kaid kar rakhaa tha
 To get her freed from captivity, her Begum Wafa Begum came to Lahore and prayed to Maharaja Ranjit Singh and said that you kindly release my husband from the captivity of Atma Mohammad, in exchange for this favor, the prized Kohinoor diamond will be presented to you
 shahshuja ke kaid ho jane ke baad vafa begum hi un dinon afghanistan kii shasika thi
 Zaman Shah, the grandson of Ahmad Shah Abdali, who invaded India in the greed to seize this Kohinoor, had his eyes taken out by his brother Mahmud Shah himself in the prison by terrible torture
 jamaan shah ahamed shah abdali ke bete taimur shah kaa betaa tha, jiskaa bhai tha mahmud shah
 Astu, Maharaja Ranjiti Singh himself wanted him to liberate Kashmir from Atamohammad
 at: suyog aane par maharaja ranjit singh ne kashmir ko aaazaad kara liya
 His Diwan Mohkamchand surrounded the fort of Shergarh and released Wafa Begum's husband Shahshuja and brought him to Lahore near Wafa Begum
 rajkumaar khadgasingh ne unhen mubarak haveli main tehraaya
 But Wafa Begum delayed the offering of Kohinoor diamond to Maharaja Ranjit Singh as promised
 yahaan tak ki kai maheene biit gaye
 When the Maharaja asked Shahshuja about the Kohinoor diamond, both he and his begum started making excuses
 jab zyada jor diya gaya to unhone ek nakli hira maharaja ranjit singh ko saunp diya, jo johariyon ke pareekshan kii kasuti par nakli sabit hua
 Ranjit Singh was filled with anger and Mubarak Haveli was surrounded
 do din tak vahaan khaanaa nahin diya gaya
 The first of June 1813 was when Maharaja Ranjit Singh came to Shahshuja and then inquired about Kohinoor
 dhoort shahshuja ne kohinoor apni pagadi main chipa rakhaa tha
 Somehow the Maharaja came to know about this
 at: unhone shahshuja ko kabul kii rajgaddi dilaane ke liye "gurugranth sahab" par haath rakhkar pratigya kii
 Then he changed his turban to Kohinoor to make him a "turban-changing brother"
 parde kii oot main baithi vafa begum maharaja kii chaturaai samaj gayi
 Now Kohinoor had reached Maharaja Ranjit Singh and he was satisfied that he had liberated Kashmir
 unki ichha thi ki ve kohinoor heere ko jagannathpuri ke mandir main pratishthit bhagwaan jagannatha ko arpit karen
 He was famous for offering mana gold to Hindu temples
 kaashi ke vishwanath mandir main bhi unhone akut sona arpit kiya tha
 But his desire to reach Jagannath God could not be fulfilled due to the treasurer of the treasurer Beliram

 The Sikh army was bravely fighting the British in the Ferozepur region

 Due to this, the Sikh army lost even after reaching near Vijay
 angrejon ne sikhon se kohinoor hira le liya
 At the same time, Kashmir and Hazara were also taken away from the Sikhs because the British had fined one and a half crores rupees to the Sikhs, the economically affected Sikhs were able to give only 50 lakh rupees in any way

 India which is India is a union of states sangh rajow ke samjhaute se nahin bana he atah ve sangh se pruthak hone kaa adhikaar bhi nahin rakhte, atah sangh avinashya he Only those states which belong to the Union Center are part of it and not the Union Territory Article 3 states that Parliament has the right to change the name and area of the state, but the Parliament will implement it only by the rules mentioned in the Constitution

 This was amended again in 1986, only by amending this government can make provision of dual citizenship
 moulik adhikaar nagariko ke adhikaar he inako america samvidhan ke bill of rhite se liya gaya he
 The reason for these rights being maulika is- The First Amendment was challenged in Shankari Prasad v
 Union of India suit 1951, when the Supreme Court, interpreting Article 13, gave two legislative powers of Parliament - saamaanya jiskaa prayog se bana act vidhi kahalaayegaa savaidhanik – jiska prayog karne par sanshodhan utpann hogayah shakti nirmaan kaari shakti he tathaa samvidhan nirmaatri sabha ne sansad ko is liye di thi taaki vah samay aane par savidhan m parivartan laa sake
 The first is only a sign of general power and by using it, the Parliament cannot amend the fundamental rights, but in the exercise of the powers of Article 368, the fundamental rights will also be subject to amendment
 yah sthiti golkanath banaam punjab rajya vaad 1967 tak rahi parantu is vaad ke nirnay m supreme court ne moulik adhikaron ko asanshodhaneey bataa diya koi bhi satta yahan tak ki sansad bhi un main sanshodhan nahin kar sakati he yah adhikaar to maatr naveen samvidhan sabha ko hi diya ja saktaa he
 In the decision of this suit, Article 368 was stated to be only constitutional amendment process and not constitutional amendment power, till that time the title of Article 368 was constitution amendment process
 In response to this decision, Parliament passed the 24th Amendment and Article 13 and Article 368 The amended composition of Article 13 declared that the amendment passed by Parliament under Article 368 will not have anything to do with Article 13, similarly the title of Article 368 is amended
 Mr
 process and have the power to Snsd
 anu 368 kaa samavesh kar kaha gaya ki 13va anuchhed main kaha gaya koi shabd anu 368 pe lagu nahin hoga
 The question of the validity of the 24th amendment was raised in the Keshavanand Bharti vs State of Kerala
 In its decision, the Supreme Court declared this amendment valid, and considered the Parliament to be an authority to amend any part of the constitution and the decision of the Golaknath suit Scrapped, but Supreme Court did not consider the parliamentary power to amend, the amendment destroyed the basic structure of the constitution or Cannot be paused even though it is free to amend any Article
 This infrastructure is a judicial invention and not a constitutional term, but the Court has indicated the structure and not a clear description of it in the decisions of subsequent promises
 Get
 ye he 1 Sovereignty of the country 2 Establishment of a welfare state 3 Balance between Directive Principles and Fundamental Rights 4 Cult Absolutism 5 Democratic and Democratic nature 6 Parliamentary democracy 7 Power of judicial review 8 Fair elections 9 Separation of powers 10 Rule of law 11 Supremacy of Constitution 12 In all three parts power balance yah suchi yahi samaapt nahin ho jaati anya lakshan bhi ho sakate he jinka nirdhaaran karne kii shakti sarvocch nyaayalay ke paas he
 The fundamental structure is made up of those parts of the constitution without which the constitution loses its fundamental form
 nav sthapit anu 368 –anu 368 ke antargat kiya gaya koi bhi sanshodhan kisi bhi nyaayalay m kisi bhi aadhaar pe chunauti nahin di ja sakati he
 Article 368 To remove ambiguity, it is declared that there is no restriction on the amending power of Parliament
 minerva mil banaam bharat sangh vaad 1980 is vaad main diye gayi nirnay main sarvocch nyaayalay ne 368, ko radd kar diya kyonki ve samvidhan ke moulik dhaanche kaa ulanghan karte he ve nyaayik punarikshan shakti ko manyata nahin dete he
 It is now a well-established fact that the power of Parliament is not unlimited
 moulik dhaanche ke laabh 1 samvidhan kii sarvocchata banaaye rakhata he2 moulik adhikaron kii garima banaayen rakhata he3 rajya ke teen angon ke madhya santulan banaaye rakhata he4 desh main bhavi sanvaidhanik vikaas ke liye aadhaar pradaan karata he in nirnyaa se utpann prabhaav ke chalate sarvocch nyaayalay ko sansad kaa teesraa sadan kaha jaataa he According to Article 352, when the National Emergency comes into force, Article 358,359 gives the President the right to suspend fundamental rights
 Anu 358 The rights given in the 19th and the same are automatically suspended in case of war or external aggression
 There is no need to order separately
 anu 359 jab rashtriya apatkaal kisi bhi kaaran se lagu ho to raashtrapati ek pruthak ghoshnaa ke madhyam se ek yaa adhik moulik adhikaro ko ninlabit kar saktaa he
 But the rights given in Article 20,21 cannot be withdrawn in any case
 The type of distinction in the provisions of Articles 358 and 359, Article 358 1 The rights of Article 2 will be suspended automatically due to war or external aggression
 The executive of the executive cannot apply until the national emergency is in force
 Article 359 1 a separate order of the President may come into force on the date of emergency for any reason

 For this, he will use the principle of natural justice, thus this process makes the court more powerful
 DU process means that the process is fair, logical, Be just and not prejudiced and free of charge, the Indian constitution only talks about the procedure established by law, but in Maneka Gandhi case, the Supreme Court said that natural justice is enshrined in Article 21 and thus it is due in due process
 According to these principles, no person will be a judge in his own case
 It will not get punishment without hearing
 3 The working establishment will work without any discrimination
 It is said that the act should be supported by logic
 This principle is universal
 According to the Supreme Court, the judiciary is also subject to them
 It is the fundamental right of the individual and private

 — Gives a person the right to practice religion 1 The right to self-consciousness 2 The right to obey, support, and propagate is also rooted in freedom of religion
 Intrinsic consciousness means the right to follow internal consciousness
 This right is uninterrupted when the inner consciousness is external
 When it takes, it also has the right to propagate but the state can also ban this right in the public interest
 The promotion of XOA is for the education of others
 In the case of Stenisal v
 Madhya Pradesh, the propaganda is just the propagation of the forwarding of ideas and its recognition, but the right of conversion is not fundamental

 'shri sammed shikharji' ke rup main charchit is punya kshetra main jain dharm ke 24 main se 20 tirthankarasn ne moksh kii prapti kii
 It was here that Lord Parshvanath, the 23rd Tirthankar also attained nirvana
 mana jaataa he ki 24 main se 20 jain ne par moksh praapt kiya tha
 This mountain, 1,350 meters high, is also the highest place in Jharkhand
 shikharji jain dharm ke anuyaayion ke liye ek mahatavpurn tirth sthal he
 Parasnath mountain is world famous
 yahan har saal lakhon jain dharmavalambiyon aate he, saath-saath anya paryatak bhi parasnath parvat kii vandana karnaa jaruri samajhate hai
 The mountain foothills from Giridih station to Madhuvan are 14 and 18 miles respectively
 pahaad kii chadhaai utraai tathaa yatra kareeb 18 mile kii he
 Sammed Shikhar is a major pilgrimage place for those who believe in Jainism
 yah jain tirthon main sarvshereshth mana jaataa he
 According to Jain scriptures, 20 of the 24 Tirthankaras of Jainism and many saints and sages attained salvation here
 isliye yah 'siddhakshetra' kehalaata he or jain dharm main ise tirthraj arthath 'tirthon kaa raja' kaha jaataa he
 This shrine is located in the Madhuban region in Giridih district of Jharkhand state, India
 yah jain dharm kaa pramukh tirth he
 It is also known as 'parasnath Parvat'
 jain granthon ke anusaar sammed shikhar or ayodhya, in donon kaa astitv sristi ke samanaantar he
 Therefore they are considered to be 'eternal'
 pracheen granthon main yahan par tirthankarasn or tapasvi santon ne kathor tapasya or dhyaan dwaara moksh praapt kiya
 This is the reason that when the Samamed Shikhar pilgrimage starts, every pilgrim's mind is filled with immense reverence, faith, enthusiasm and happiness by remembering the Tirthankaras
 jain dharm shastron main likhaa he ki apane jivan main sammed shikhar tirth kii ek baar bhavpurn yatra karne par mrityu ke baad vyakti ko pashu yoni or narak praapt nahin hota
 It has also been written that a person who comes to the summit shikhar and performs devotion with full mind, emotion and devotion, gets salvation and remains free from the shackles of all birth-karma of this world for the next 49 births
 yah sab tabhi sambhav hota he, jab yahan par sabhi bhakt tirthankarasn ko samaran kar unke dwaara die gaye upadeshon, shikshaaon or siddhanton kaa shuddh aacharan ke saath paalan karen
 Thus this area is considered very sacred
 is kshetra kii pavitrataa or satviktaa ke prabhaav se hi yahan par paae jane vaale sher, baagh aadi junglee pashuon kaa swaabhaavik hinsak vyavhaar nahin dekha jaataa
 For this reason, pilgrims also travel without fear
 sambhavat: isi prabhaav ke kaaran pracheen samay se kai raajaaon, aacharyon, bhattarak, shravakon ne aatm-kalyaan or moksh prapti kii bhaavana se tirthayatra ke liye vishaal samoohon ke saath yahan aakar tirthankarasn kii upasna, dhyaan or kathor tap kiya
 Jain Ethics has described that the first of the 24 Tirthankaras of Jainism, Tirthankara Lord 'adinath' means Lord Rishabhdev on Mount Kailash, 12th Tirthankara Lord Vasupujya on Champapuri, 22nd Tirthankara Lord Neminath on Mount Girnar and 24th and last Tirthankara Lord Mahavira
 Attained salvation in Pavapuri
 shesh 20 tirthankarasn ne sammed shikhar main moksh praapt kiya
 Lord Parshvanath, the 23rd Tirthankara of Jainism, also attained salvation in this pilgrimage through rigorous penance and meditation
