 He was a member of the Banu Hashim clan, a respected branch of the prestigious and influential Qureshi tribe
 According to Islamic books, before the birth of Muhammad, his mother had seen many spasms, in which he was told about his godliness and spiritual significance

 After receiving news of Abdullah's illness by the caravan, Hazrat Abdul Mutallib sent his elder son al-harit to Medina, but after leaving there al-harit learned that his brother had died a month after the illness

 Terminology varies between countries
 udhaaharan ke liye, sanyukt rajya america main ek farm jahaan doodh nikaalane kaa kaam hota he milking parlor ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The historical name of such a building in New Zealand is the Milking Shed - although in recent years, due to progressive changes these buildings have come to be known as Farm Dairy

 Farmers who have contracted the supply of liquid milk for human consumption often manage their herd so that they continue to deliver milk throughout the year or maintain the required minimum milk production
 This is done by mating cows outside of their natural mating time so that when they are in the herd, a cow gives maximum production and this rotation continues throughout the year

 dudharu gaay duhane ke samay main aniyamitata nahin sah paati hai jabatak doodh utpaadan main koi gambhir katautee na ho
 Patti-style sheds - This type of milking facility was first developed after milking in an open paddock
 ek lambii sankeern, patali, ek taraf se jhuki or khuli hui lambii shed kaa nirmaan kiya gaya
 The cows were kept on the open side of the yard and they were made to stand in a strip while milking
 aamtaur par gaayon ko ek shrinkhalaa main niyantrit rakhane ke liye unke peeche ke pairon ko rassi se baandh diya jaataa tha
 The cows could not move much from their place and could not kick the milker when the milk milker sat on a stool and extracted milk in a bucket
 jab prayek gaay se doodh nikaalane kaa kaam samaapt ho jaataa to unhen waapas apni jagah par bhej diya jaataa tha
 In Britain, this type of shed was developed by Rex Patterson, with six mobile standing sheds on which cows would be erected so that shepherds would not have to bend too low
 The milking device was modern-day, a vacuum from a pump, pulsation, claw with pipe, armor and liners that excite and suck milk from the teat causing a vacuum from a claw piece along the pipe
 The milk goes into a churn through the cooler
 jaise hi jhund ke aakaar main vruddhi hoti thi prayek pattee ke saamne ek darwaja sthapit kar diya jaataa tha taaki jaise hi gaay ko duhane kaam puraa ho, pairon main bandhi rassi ko kholkar dur se hi us daravaaje ko kholkar gaay ko baahar charne ke liye bhej diya jaataa tha
 The door used to be locked, the next cow secured in a strip
 jab doodh dene kii mashin kii shuruuaat kii gai to ek jode main gaayon se doodh nikaala jaataa tha tabatak anya ko doodh dene ke liye taiyaar kiya jaataa tha
 At the end of the earlier machine cup was applied to the other cow
 yah bilkul swingover doodh duhane kaa parlor ke samaan tha jiskaa varnan neeche kiya gaya he
 With the increase in the number of herds, instead of increasing the number of strips, milk was easily milked from cows by double doubling the number of cups
 ek shed main ghante bhar main 8 pattiyon ke saath ek vyakti dwaara 50 gaayon ko duh liya jaataa he, baar-baar gaayon ke liye ek hi chuchee cap kaa upyog karne se sankraman, stan kii sujan sanchaarit hone kaa khatra rahata he
 Some farmers have found their own ways to disinfect cows groups
 herringbon milking parlor -herringbon milking shed yaa parlor main, gaay ekal tareeke se pravesh karti hai or unhen galiyare main lagbhag lambavatt khadaa kar doodh duhanevaale apana kaam karte hai than or chuchuk kii dhulaai ke baad or doodh dene kii mashin ke cap ko gaayon ko laga diya jaataa, unke pichley pairon ke peeche se, kaam karne ke kshetra ke donon kinaaron par
 bade herringbon shed main do logon ke saath 600 gaayon se kushaltapurvak doodh nikaala ja saktaa he
 Swingover milking parlor - Swingover parlor is exactly the same as herringbone parlor with only one set of milking cups between two rows of cows, which are shared between the cows, with one side replaced by the other after milking
 It is done
 is pranali kaa laabh yah he ki yah kam mahangaa he, halaki isse 100 gaayon se adhik ke doodh ke liye koshish nahin kii ja sakati lekin yah aadhe gati se adhik behatar rup se sanchalit he
 Rotary Milking Shed - Rotary milking sheds have a rotating wheel with approximately 12 to 100 separate stalls for cows around the outer end
 ek "achche" rotary ke saath ek saath 24-32 stallon ek yaa duhane waalon dwaara sanchalit kiya ja saktaa he
 The cycle is driven by an electric motor and rotates at such a speed that milk is completely released from one cow at a time
 As soon as a stall is empty, a cow steps in from the entrance and starts walking with the wheel
 isprakaar agali gaay agle khaali stall ke taraf chali jaati he
 The operator or milk weaners clean the nipples and attach them to the cup and do any other food or whatever work is necessary
 jabatak doodh nikaala jaataa he gaayen manch par hi rahati hai
 The milker, or an automatic device, removes the cup of the milking machine and holds the cow's back and leaves it at an exit just before the entrance
 rotary pranali ek hajaar gaayon se bhi adhik bade jhund kaa doodh duhane main sakasham he
 Automatic Milking Sheds - Automatic milking or 'robotic milking' sheds can be seen in Australia, New Zealand and many European countries
 Current automatic milking sheds use the voluntary milking method
 isamen gaayon ko swechha se din ho yaa raat ke kisi bhi samay doodh dene ke liye khud ko prastut karte hai, haalanki dohraane kaa daura computer software ke madhyam se kisaan dwaara simit kiya ja saktaa he
 a robot arm cleans the device and the nipple before being used for milking, while the gates move the cow out of the way automatically, during which the farmer does not need to be present
 The entire process is controlled by a computer
 yahaan swat: pranali kaa vivaran diya gaya he- Supplementary Equipment in the Shed - Farmers soon realized that a milking shed was a good supplementary diet for cows that could be fueled by a lack of local diet or 'cows' goodness and production
 prayek puaal ke box ko is prakaar rakhaa jaataa he ki gaay ke aate hi use khaanaa mil jaae taaki duhane ke samay main vah khaati rahe
 ek computer prayek jaanavar ke liye sahi poorak rashan ko pard saktaa he
 In the stalls of a close alternative 'out-of-parlor-feeder', a transponder around the neck of the cow, it was programmed to benefit by providing the main ration for each cow, depending on the age and production capacity of the cow 
 shed ke pravesh dwaar par gaayon ko pakad kar shed main rakhane ke liye shed yard ek mahatvapurn saadhan he
 a powered gate ensures how cows are kept closed
 deyari farm par pani bahut mahatvapurn he: gaayon dinabhar main 20 galen pani pi leti hai or baaki pani kii jarurat shed ko saaf or svachh rakhane ke liye hoti he
 Pumping and reservoir facilities are common in milking locations
 pani ko doodh ke saath garmi hastantaran dwaara garam kiya ja saktaa he
 The milk coming from the cow is transported around the cup by air inlet in a special claw to a storage container near it
 vahaan se yah ek yantric pump dwaara nikaala or garmi excanger dwaara thanda kiya jaataa he doodh ke bade bartan yaa thok tanks main sangrahit kar, aamtaur par prashitit kar sansaadhit kiya jaataa he Subject: aise deshon main, jahaan gaay saal bhar baahar jaakar charati hai vahaan bahut kam apshisht niptaan karnaa padataa he
 The most waste milk is at the milking shed, where animal waste is liquefied and poured with ponds anaerobic bacteria mixed with effluent or with a solid pump
 sansaadhit pani or poshak tatwon ko pump dwaara waapas nikaalkar urvarak ke rup main sinchai ke kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 Surplus animals are converted to sacrificial meat and to other products
 sambaddhit doodh processing kaarkaanon main, aamtaur par dhulaai ke baad bachaa hua ganda pani hi apshisht hota he jise parishkrut karne ke baad jalmaarg main lautaa diya jaataa he
 This is very different from half a century ago when the main products were butter, cheese, and casein, and the rest of the milk was disposed of as waste
 aise kshetron main jahaan gaayon puure varsh bhar rakhe jate hai, apshisht kii samasya bahut jatil hoti he bachi hui khaadya saamagree he or beding apshisht ko bhi sangrahit kar nipataara karnaa padataa he
 The size of this problem can be seen in the standing enclosure where such dairy is run
 kai maamalon main, aadhunik formon main bahut badi maatra main prasanskaran ke liye doodh ko kaarkaane main bheja jaataa he
 Attempting to dispose of huge amounts of milk can be a major disaster if anything goes wrong or something goes wrong with milking, transportation or processing facilities
 agar sadak par tanker palat jaataa he to sadak par bachaav dal ko 20-45 hajaar galen doodh ko niptaana padataa he
 a derailed tanker train can contain 10 times more volume than this
 prashithan ke bina, doodh nasht ho jaataa he or ucch jaev rasinic oxigen kii maang ke kaaran yah vaataavaran ke liye bahut hanikaarak hota he
 a massive power blackout is a disaster for the dairy industry as both milking and processing facilities are affected
 is ke liye, farm aksar mobile janarator kaa upyog kar sakate hai
 Such a situation was encountered during the 2010 Canterbury earthquake
 deyari pradhan kshetron main, doodh kii ek badi maatra ke liye vibhinn tareekon ke niptaan kaa prastaav rakhaa gaya he
 These include feeding area animals, spray irrigation and sacrificial areas
 bhoomi par doodh ko failaane se, yaa kisi chhed main ise daalane se bahut badi samasya kaa saamana karnaa padataa he kyonki doodh ke chacha bhoomi ke chhed ko band kar dete hai or pani mitti ke madhyam se jameen ke andar ja nahin paata he
 It can take a long time to recover from its effects, any land based application must be managed well

 Spontaneous instinct is the natural inclination of a particular behavior]

 Other examples include animal fighting, animal courtship behavior, internal methods of escape, and construction of ghouls

 Instinctual activities - in contrast to learning-based activities that are based on memory and provide individually stored successful responses based on experiences - do not involve any training, are implicit and without any training Be ready for use

 Biological trends are instinctive and biologically motivated behaviors that can be easily learned
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek bachhda ek ghante main hi khadey hona, chalanaa, kudana-phandana tathaa daudna sikh saktaa he
 a biological tendency also means that some individuals may be more susceptible to certain conditions and diseases due to their genetic structure

 In pure manifestations and instincts, their presence in the nervous system can be differentiated; Reflexes are controlled by the spinal or other peripheral ganglia, while the innate instinct is dominated by the brain
 aisi paristhiti jisame do sahaj vrittiyaan ek duusare kii virodhabhasi hon, koi jaanavar visthaapan gatividhiyon kii ore rukh kar saktaa he
 According to a theory of innate instinct, the inherent inclination is stored in DNA and is therefore passed from parents to their children
 sahaj vyavhaar ko pashu jivan main kaaphi vyapak rup se pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 According to Darwin's theory of 'evolution by natural selection', favorable qualities such as innate instinct in animals are selected for superior competition and better rate of survival

 a good example of immediate instinct in certain types of birds is to 'leave a mark'
 This is the same behavior that motivates duckling children to go after the first moving object they encounter, as it is usually their mother
 is avadharana par manovaigyanik conrad laurenj dwaara kaaphi kaam kiya gaya he
 Another important aspect of leaving a mark is sexual selection
 Young birds attach great importance to the qualities of their opposite-sex parent for the choice of preferred mate

 The result may differ in the sense that a finch bird will sing naturally, but will often sing the same songs it has acquired during a sensitive period; This is also the reason for the presence of different regional styles in finch bird songs

 First, phenotypic plasticity enables a person to coordinate with a partially successful mutation, which would otherwise be completely useless for that individual
 yadi yah utparivartan samgr fitness ko badhaata he to yah safal hoga or puri aabaadi main iskaa vistaar hoga
 Phenotypic plasticity generally proves to be quite expensive for a person; Teaching requires time and energy and at times involves dangerous mistakes
 isliye ek doosraa charan bhi he: paryaapt samay pradaan kiye jane par, vikaas plastic prakriya ko hataane ke liye ek anwarat prakriya ko khoj saktaa he
 Thus a behavior that was previously learned later converts to instinctual instinct over time

 The term "innate instinct" has had a long and varied use in psychology
 1870 ke dashak main, wilhem wundt ne pratham manovigyaan prayogshaala kii sthapana kii
 At that time, psychology was originally a branch of philosophy, but behavior began to be increasingly tested within the framework of the scientific method
 haalanki vaigyanik paddati ke upyog ke kaaran shabdon ko kaaphi vishuddh tareeke se paribhaashit kiya jane laga tha, 19 veen shatabdi ke ant tak adhikansh dohraye jane vaale vyavhaar ko sahaj vritti mana jane laga
 At that time, in a survey of literature, a researcher listed 4000 human instincts, that is, every repetitive behavior that someone has named
 jaise-jaise shodh badhati gayi or shabdon ko behatar tareeke se paribhaashit kiya jane laga, maanav vyavhaar ke varnan rup main sahaj vritti kaa istemaal kam maatra main kiya jane laga
 At a conference chaired by Frank Beach, who introduced comparative psychology in 1960, the use of the term was severely limited
 60 or 70 ke dashak ke dauraan, pathyapustakon main maanav vyavhaar ke sandarbh main sahaj vritti kii kuch charchaaon ko abhi bhi shaamil kiya jaataa tha
 By the year 2000, a survey of the 12 best-selling textbooks in introductory psychology had discussed only one reference to innate instinct and one with reference to Sigmund Freud's "id" innate instinct
 kisi bhi dohraye jane vaale vyavhaar ko "sahaj vritti" kaha ja saktaa he, isi shabd ko kisi bhi anya aise vyavhaar ke liye bhi prayukt kiya ja saktaa he jiske liye koi shashakt nihit kaaran maujuud ho
 However, to distinguish between an organism's out-of-control behavior and repetitive behavior, we can turn to the book "instinct" coming out of the 1960 Convention
 sahaj vritti tathaa anya prakaar ke vyavhaaron ke bich bhed karne ke liye kai mandandon ko sthapit kiya gaya tha
 To be considered a natural instinct, a behavior must include - 1) automatic, 2) dominant, 3) appearing at some point in development, 4) triggered by an event in the environment, 5) in each member of the species Visibility, 6) Insensitive, 7) Controlling behavior for which the organism does not require any training
 inamen se ek yaa adhik maapdand kaa abhaav is baat kaa sanket he ki vyavhaar puri tarah se sahaj vritti nahin he
 Spontaneous circles are present in insects and animals, as can be seen in their behavior which cannot be changed by learning
 Psychologists recognize that humans have many biological instincts and behaviors that are easy to learn due to their biological structure, for example walking or talking
 agar in mandandon kaa vishuddh vaigyanik tareeke se prayog kiya jaye, "sahaj vritti" shabd ke prayogon ko maanav vyavhaar ke sandarbh main istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa
 jab mamata, kshetra-aadhipaty, khaanaa, sambhog, aadi jaise shabdon kaa istemaal maanav vyavhaar ke liye kiya jaataa he, to aisa prathit hota he ki ve uparokt mandandon par puri tarah se khare nahin utarate hai
 Unlike human behavior such as hibernation, migration, nesting, mating, etc
, no human behavior meets the necessary criteria
 or pashuon ke sambandh main bhi, kai maamalon main agar sahi shikshan ko prakat hone se roak diya jaye to ye sahaj vritti vaale vyavhaar bhi gaayab ho jate hai, jo yah ingit karata he ki ve shaktishaalee kintu simit jaivik pravritiyaan maatr hai
 In the final analysis, no human innate instinct exists under this definition
 kuch saamaajik tathaa prakritik jaev vigyaniyon ne maanav tathaa pashu saamaajik vyavhaar ko sahaj vritti ke sandarbh main samajhane kii cheshtaa kii he
 Psychoanalysts state that innate instinct refers to human motivational forces, which sometimes appear as a spontaneous life-related instinct or an instinct of death
 prerak shaktiyon shabd ke is prayog ko mukhyatah sahaj pravritiyon shabd se pratisthapit kar diya gaya he
 Human spontaneous instincts can also be seen in automatic actions
 babinsaki riflex jaisi sahaj kriyaaon ko shishuon main dekha ja saktaa he or ve vikaas ke charnon ko ingit karti hai
 These spontaneous actions can be considered purely instinctual as they usually occur without environmental influences or adaptation
 atirikt maanav lakshan jinhen sahaj vritti ke rup main dekha gaya he, is prakaar hai: sona, ghrinaa, cheharaa padhanaa, bhashaa siikhnaa, "ladanaa yaa bhaagna" or "vasheebhoot karnaa yaa hona"
 manushyon tathaa vanar samaajon main kiye gaye kuch prayog bhi is nishkarsh par pahunche hai ki nishpakshta kii bhaavana ko sahaj vritti ke tahat mana ja saktaa he, jahaan manushya tathaa vanar swayan tathaa dusron ke saath kiye gaye pakshpaati vyavhaar ke virodh main swayan ke hiton ko nuksaan pahunchane ke liye bhi tatpar rahete hai
 Many scientists believe that it is a natural instinct for children to put everything in their mouths because by this they tell their immune system about their environment and environment, what to adopt
 anya samajashastriyon kaa tark he ki manushya main koi sahaj vritti nahin hoti he; ve use is rup main paribhaashit karte hai, "ek prajati vishesh ke prayek sadsy main maujuud rahane vaale jatil vyavhaar, jo sahaj hote hai or jinpar kaabo nahin paaya ja saktaa he
 "such sociologists argue that trends like sex and hunger cannot be considered instinctual because they can be controlled
 yah paribhaashik tark jeev vigyaan or samajashaastra kii kai parichayatmak pathyapustakon main maujuud he, lekin abhi bhi isapar garma-garam bahes jari he
 Psychologist Abraham Maslow argues that no innate instinct is present in humans now because we have the ability to overcome them under certain circumstances
 unka maananaa he ki jise ham sahaj vritti kehete hai use aksar sateek tareeke se paribhaashit nahin kiya jaataa or vastav main vah ati shashakt ichha ke sivaa or kuch nahin he
 For Maslow, instinct is one that cannot be controlled and therefore it may have been applied to humans in the past, but today it is not so

 The dragons found in folklore have the properties of all three, providing answers to why dragons with similar characteristics appear in stories from independent cultures of all continents
 anya lekhakon kaa suzav he ki nashili dawaaon ke prabhaav yaa swapn main yah sahaj vritti dragon, sanpon, makadiyon se sambandhit kalpanaaon ko utpann kar sakati he; isi karanvash ye pratik nashili dawaaon kii samskruti main kaaphi prachlit hai
 However, the traditional mainstream interpretation of the dragon's presence in folklore relies on the notion that dinosaur fossil remains gave rise to similar speculation throughout the world, rather than on human instinct

 The plots were fabricated and staged in which one person was confused with the other, events played a coincidence, fiery speeches, the thrill of hanging from the rocks, and they were defended at the last moment, the true hero Victory was shown over the evil villain and all of them were credited with song and music

 After the pulmonary artery exits the right ventricle, it divides into two branches and one branch goes into each pleural
 is dhamni kaa prayojan oxigen lene ke liye rudhir ko phuffus main pahunchaana he
 After going out of the left ventricle of the heart, go first to the right, then backwards, then to the left, where the fourth thorax reaches the left side of the vertebra and goes straight down to the end of the thoracic descending
