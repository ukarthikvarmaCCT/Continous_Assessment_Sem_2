 uskaa mukhya gram dyumat tha kintu vah pratardan, ritudhvaj or kuvalayaashv naamon se bhi vikhyath tha
 In the Universe and Vayu Puranas, Vats is said to be the son of Pratardan, not calling Vatsa and Pratardana as one

 puraani metric pranali main kai ikaayiyon ke samooh prayog kiye jate the
 SI was developed in 1960 from the old meter-kilogram-second system, rather than the centimeter-gram-second system, which had many difficulties
 SI pranali sthir nahin rahati, varan isamen nirantar vikaas hote rahete hai, parantu ikaiyaan anterrashtriya samjhauton ke dwaara hi banaai or badali jaati hai
 The system is almost universally applicable and most countries do not even understand the official definitions of other units
 parantu iske apwaad sanyukt rajya america or britain hai, jahaan abhi bhi gaiyr-si ikaayiyon unki puraani pranaliyaan lagu hai
 In India, this system came into force on 1 April 1957
 iske saath hi yahaan nayaa paisa bhi lagu hua, jo ki swayan dashamalav pranali par aadhaarit tha
 Many new naming units came into force in this system
 is pranali main saat mul ikaiyaan or anya kai vyutpann ikaiyaan hai
 Other units are also used with the SI system in some scientific and cultural fields
 SI upsargon ke madhyam se bahut choti or bahut badi matraaon ko vyakt karne main saralata hoti he
 The difference between the definition and implementation of an entity is important
 prayek SI mul ikai kii paribhaasha saavdhaanee purvak banaai gai he taaki vah apurv or adwitiya ho or saath saath ek thos saidhantik aadhaar prastut kare jis par aadhaarit sabase parishuddh or punarutpaadaneey maapan kiye ja saken
 The process of implementing a definition of a unit is one in which that definition, like that unit, establishes the value of its quantity and the uncertainty associated with it; Can be used
 kuch mahatvapurn ikaayiyon kii paribhaashaayen kaise karyanvit kii jaati hai, yah BIPM kii websit par diya gaya haiek SI vyutpann ikai adwitiya rup keval SI mul ikaayiyon ke rup main hi paribhaashit hoti he
 For example, the SI derivative unit of electrical resistance, ohms, is uniquely defined by this relation: ω = m2 kg s − 3 a − 2, which is the result of the definition of the amount of electrical resistance
 vaise koi bhi tarika, jo ki bhautikee ke siddhanton / niyamon se saamanjasy rakhata ho, vah kisi bhi SI ikaayiyon ke karyanvayan hetu prayog ho saktaa he
 The metric system was designed by a group of scientists
 inamen antoni loriat lavashie pramukh the, jinhen aadhunik rasayanashastra kaa janak kaha jaataa he
 To make this group a rational measurement system; Was unified and authorized by the French Emperor Louis XVI
 francisi kranti ke uparaant nai sarkaar dwaara yah pranali angeekrut kar lee gai thi
 a new decimal meter was also adopted by the National Conference on August 1, 1793, and defined a temporary length as well as other decimal units
 7 april, 1795 ko, gramme evam kilogramme ne puraani shabdaawalee "gravet" evam "grev" kaa sthaan liya
 On December 10, 1799, the metric system was permanently adopted in France
 aaj vishwa bhar main prayog ho rahi metric pranali ne kai badlaav dekhe hai
 It has also superseded many traditional systems
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke bahut baad tak kai bhinn maapan pranaliyaan vishwa bhar main prayukt ho raheen thim
 Many of these systems were different from the metric system, while others were based on either the Imperium system or the American system
 tab yah aavashyaktaa siddh hui ki in sab kaa metrikaran hona chaiye, jisase ek vishwavyaapee maapan pranali banaai ja sake
 Consequently, the ninth General Conference on Weights and Measures was held in 1948 in which the International Committee on Weights and Measures was directed to conduct an international study of the measurement requirements of scientific, technological and teaching committees
 is adhyayan ke parinaamon par aadhaarit, dasvin CGPM ne 1954 main yah nirnay kiya ki chah mul ikaayiyon se ek anterrashtriya pranali vyutapann kii jaae, jo ki yantric evam vidyutchumbakeey matraaon kii saath hi taapmaana evam drushti sambandhi vikiranon kaa maapan uplabdh kara paae
 The six original units approved were meters, kilograms, seconds, amperes, degrees, calvin and candela
 1960 main, 11wein CGPM ne is pranali kaa namakaran anterrashtriya ikai pranali yaa International System of Units, sankshep main SI jo multah bana he french se: Le Système international d'unités
 saatvin mul ikai, mol yaa the mole, ko 1971 main 14wein CGPM main joda gaya
 The International Standardization Organization or ISO standard ISO 31 contains recommendations by the International Electrotechnical Commission or IEC for use in electrical applications of the international unit system, of which their standard IEC 60027 is also noteworthy
 vah kaary abhi pragati par he jisase kii donon kaa ekikaran kar ek sanyukt maanak ISO / IEC 8 xxrep 4 0 bane, jise matraaon kii anterrashtriya pranali yaa International System of Quantities kaha jaae
 In the international unit system, there is a group of units, with the same group of prefixes
 SI ikaayiyon ko do upasamoohon main baanta ja saktaa he :- These units as well mul ikai ke gunak banane hetu, SI upsarg ko joda ja saktaa he
 All multiples are absolute numbers of ten
 udhaahrantah kilo-= sahasr yaa hajaar mili-= hajaarwaan bhaag yani ek meter main ek hajaar millimetre hote hai, saath hi ek hajaar meter se ek kilo meter banataa he
 Prefixes cannot be mixed
 ek kilogram kaa das lakhwan bhaag he milligram parantu use ek micro-kilogram nahin kahenge
 To establish a relationship between the units used in different systems, the unit is created from the tradition or basic definition of the unit
 ikaayiyon ke bich antaran hetu antaran karkon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 There are several versions of transfer factors, see for example Appendix B, NIST SP 811
 spacific gravity ko praayah SI ikaayiyon main, yaa pani ke sandarbh main darshit kiya jaataa he
 Because a cube whose size is 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, its volume will be 1000 cm3, which is equal to 1 L; And when filled with water, its weight is 1 kg, hence the specific gravity of water is 1 g / cm3 and it will freeze at 0 ° C
 metric pranali ko arth evam dainik vaanijya saadhan ke rup main vishwavyaapee samarthan mila he
 The reason for this was also to a large extent that many countries did not have the ability to explain many principles in conservative systems
 saath hi kshetreey badlaavon kaa maanakeekaran kar ek vishwa vyapee pranali, jo sarv maanya ho, bani
 This also encouraged international trade
 vaigyanik drushtikon se dekhen, to isamen atyadhik badi or atisookshm ikaayiyon ko bhi dashamalav ke prayog se bataaya ja saktaa he
 Many units of daily and scientific experimentation are not derived from the seven basic units

 Some examples include: european sangh ne ek nirdesh diya he jo gaiyr-si chinhit saamaan kii bikri ko 31 disambar 2009 ke baad se pratibandhit karata he
 This applies to all products, attached instructions and papers, packing and advertisements
 lekin 11 sitambar 2007 ko, EU ne ghoshit kiya he, ki britain ko is nirdesh se mukt karte hai or unka imparial pranali abhi bhi aniyat roopen maanya hoga, saath saath main metric pranali ke diya ho to

 saanchaa:capitalism Privatization is the event or process of transferring ownership of a business, enterprise, agency or public service from the public sector to the private sector or private non-profit organizations

 In more recent times, Winston Churchill's government privatized the British steel industry in 1950, and the government of West Germany began large-scale privatization in 1961, including selling its majority stake in Volkswagen to small investors
 
 1970 ke dashak main general pinoshe ne chile main mahatvapurn nijeekaran kaarykram lagu kiya tha
 However, privatization gained global momentum in the 1980s under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher in Britain and Ronald Reagan in the United States

 In the 1990s, state-owned enterprises were privatized in Eastern and Central Europe and in the former Soviet Union, in collaboration with the World Bank, the American Agency for International Development, the German Truehand and other governmental and non-governmental organizations
 ek pramukh rup se chal rahe nijeekaran main, jo ki japan dak seva se sambandhit he, main japani dak seva tathaa duniya kaa sabase bada bank shaamil hai
 This privatization began in 2007 under the leadership of Junichiro Koizumi, after several generations of debate
 nijeekaran kii is prakriya ke 2017 tak khatm hone kii aashaa he
 There are mainly four methods of privatization: bikri vidhi kaa chayan puunji bazaar, raajnneetik evam company-vishesh ke karkon par nirbhar karata he
 When capital markets are less developed and income inequality is less, then SIP is more likely
 share nirgam, taralata badha kar tathaa aarthik vikaas dwaara gharelu puunji bazaar ko vistrut or saghan kar sakate hai, kintu yadi aparyaapt rup se viksit hai, to adhik khariddaar milane kathin honge tathaa lenden laagat adhik ho sakati he
 For this reason, many governments choose to be listed in more developed and liquidity markets, for example Euronext, and the London, New York and Hong Kong stock markets
 atyadhik raajnneetik or mudra jokhim se videshi niveshkon ke bhaybheet hone ke parinamswaroop vikasshil deshon main sampada bikri hona adhik aam he
 Voucher privatization has occurred primarily in the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe, such as Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia
 iske atirikt, neeche se nijeekaran sankraman arthvyavasthaaon main aarthik vikaas kii ek mahatvapurn vidhi he / rahi he
 a major advantage of share or asset-sale privatization is that the competition generated by bidders offering the highest value creates income for the state in addition to tax revenue
 duusari taraf, vauchar nijeekaran main, bhagidaari or shaamil kiye jane kii ek vaastavik bhaavana paidaa karte hue aam janata ko sampatti kaa vaastavik hastantaran ho saktaa he
 If the transfer of vouchers is allowed, a voucher market may be created with companies offering to pay for them
 nijeekaran ke samarthakon kaa maananaa he ki nijee bazaar kaarak mukt bazaar pratiyogita ke kaaran sarkaron kii tulana main adhik kushalta se maal athwa seva pradaan kar sakate hai
 It is generally argued that over time this will reduce prices, improve quality, get more choices, reduce corruption, red lace will not be royal and quick delivery will occur
 kai samarthak yah tark nahin dete hai ki har cheez kaa nijeekaran kiya janaa chahie
 According to him, market failure and natural monopolies can be problematic
 haalanki, kuch austrian vichaardhaara ke arthshaastri or arajak-puunjipati chaahate hai ki raksha or vivaad samaadhaan sahit rajya ke har kaary kaa nijeekaran hona chahie
 The basic economic rationale for privatization is that governments have very few incentives to ensure their enterprises run well
 rajya ke ekadhikaar main, tulana kii kami ek samasya he
 With no competitor present to compare, it is very difficult to tell whether the venture is efficient or not
 duusare yah ki centre sarkaar prashasan or matadaata jinhone unhen chunaa he, ko itane saare or alag-alag udhyamon kii kshamta kaa moolyankan karne main kathinaayee hoti he
 a private owner, often with expertise and more knowledge of a certain industrial sector, can evaluate and punish or reward management more efficiently in small numbers of enterprises
 iske atirikt, ek nijee maalik ke vipareet, sarkarein rajasav aparyaapt hone par, karadhaan se yaa keval mudra kaa mudran karke dhan juta sakati hai
 If private and state-owned enterprises compete against each other, state-owned enterprises get loans from the lending market at a cheaper rate than private enterprises, as state-owned enterprises ultimately lag behind state-owned enterprises
 The power of taxation and printing is the strength, giving them an unfair advantage
 rajya ke swaamitv vaali ek alaabhadaayak company kaa nijeekaran karne se, vah company labhotpadak banane ke liye keemten badha sakati he
 However, to meet the deficit from this, the government will not need to invest the money received from taxes in it
 nijeekaran ke samarthak nimnlikhit tark dete hai: Opponents of privatization oppose the claim that the government lacks incentives to run public services well, on the grounds that the government is accountable to the people as representative owners
 yah tark diya gaya he ki jo sarkaar rashtriyakrut udhyamon ko kharaab dhang se chalaaegi vah logon kaa samarthan or mat kho degi, jabaki udhyamon ko acchhee tarah chalaane vaali sarkaron ko logon kaa samarthan or mat milenge
 is prakaar, loktantric sarkaron ke paas bhi, bhavishya ke chunaavon ke dabaav ke kaaran rashtriyakrut companiyon main adhiktam dakshata badhaane ke rup main protsaahan uplabdh hai
 Some opponents of privatization believe that some public goods and services should primarily remain in the hands of the government to ensure that every person in the society has access to them
 Similarly, some private goods and services should remain in the hands of the private sector
 jab sarkaar bade paimaane par samaaj ke liye saarvajanik maal or sevaayen uplabdh karaati he, to ek sakaaratmak bahyata hoti he, jaise raksha or rog niyantran
 prakritik ekadhikaar ke liye apane swabhaav ke kaaran hi ve nishpaksh pratiyogita ke adheen nahin hai or inhen rajya dwaara prashasit karnaa hi behatar he
 Controlling the moral issue in the anti-privatization perspective requires responsible leadership for the social support mission
 bazaar kii parsparik kriyaayein nijee swaarth se nirdeshit hoti hai or ek swasth bazaar main safal pradarshkon ko jitna bazaar sahan kar sake, adhiktam mulya vasuul karne ke liye patibaddh hona chahie
 Opponents of privatization believe that this model is not compatible with government missions for social assistance, whose primary objective is to provide affordable and quality service to society
 kai nijeekaran virodhiyon ne is prakriya main antarnihit bhrashtachar kii pravriti ke khilaaf bhi chetavanee di he
 Many areas that the government can provide are essentially unprofitable, one way private companies can work in them is through contracts or withholding payments
 in maamalon main, ek vishesh pariyojna main nijee form ke pradarshan ko unke pradarshan se hataa diya jayega or gaban or khatarnaak laagat katautee ke upaay karke laabh ko adhiktam kiya ja saktaa he
 In addition, large corporations can pay public relations professionals to convince decision-makers that privatization is a sensible idea
 nigamon ke paas aam taur par nijeekaran virodhiyon kii tulana main kahin adhik visheshgy kathan, vigyaapan, sammelan or anya prachaar hetu sansaadhan hai
 Some would also point out that the privatization of certain functions of the government affects coordination and accuses companies of not being suitable with specific and limited capacity to perform
 yuddh se videern desh ke buniyadi dhaanche ke punarnirmaan main udhaaharan ke liye, ek nijee form, ke liye suraksha pradaan karne ke liye yaa to suraksha kiraaye par leni hoti he jo nishchit rup se simit or unke kaaryon ko jatil banane vaali hogi, athwa sarkaar ke saath samanvay karnaa hota he, jo form or sarkaar ke bich saajha kaman dhaanche kii kami ke kaaran bahut mushkil ho saktaa he
 On the other hand, a government agency has the entire army to call for protection, whose chain of command is clearly defined
 virodhiyon kaa kahana he ki yah ek jhooth daawa he: kitni hi pustakon main sarkari vibhaagon ke bich kamjor sanghathan ke sandarbh hai 
 Although private companies will provide the same good goods or services as the government, opponents of privatization are cautious to hand over public goods, services, and assets entirely to private hands for the following reasons: anya log is par vivaad nahin karte ki acchhee tarah chal rahi laabh-kamaane vaali ikaiyaan, kisi akushal sarkari naukarshahi yaa enjio ke mukaable majboot nigamit sushasan ke saath adhik daksh hoti hai, haalanki vyavhaar main nijeekaran ke kai kriyanvayanon ke parinamswaroop or / yaa aksham yaa bhrasht- laabhke-liye prabandhan ke liye, saarvajanik sampatti kii kodiyon ke bhav bikri hoti he
 a top executive can easily reduce the perceived value of an asset due to information asymmetry
 anumaanit kharch ke lekhankan main teji laakar, anumaanit aay ke lekhankan main deree karke, asthai rup se company kii laabhpradata kamjor dikhaane ke liye tulan-patr se baahar len-dein kar ke, yaa sidhe bhavishya kii aay kaa gambhir rup se roodhiwaadee anumaan prastut karke ek kaaryakari aisa kar saktaa he
 In this way, the news of adverse income will reduce the selling price
 In general there are very few legal hazards when one is 'overly narrow' in accounting and income estimation
 jab ikai ko nijee sanstha dwaara liya jaataa he - ek naatakeey rup se kam keemat par - nae nijee maalik ko sheersh kaaryakari ke bikri mulya ko kam karne ke krity se ek apratyaashit laabh hota he
 Thus tens of billions of dollars are transferred from previous owners to the acquirer
 purv sheersh adhikari ko tab kodiyon ke daam bikri, jo kabhi-kabhi ek-do saal ke kaam ke badale dasiyon yaa saikadon lakh dollar ho sakati he, karne vaale kaam kii adhyakshata karne ke liye golden handshek se puraskrit kiya jaataa he
 Top officials often reap tremendous monetary benefits when a publicly held asset, mutual or non-profit organization is privatized
 kaaryakari is prakriya ko ikai ko vittiya sankat main dikhaa kar, sugam bana dete hai- isse bikri mulya ghat jaataa he or use labharahit bana dete hai, tathaa jisase sarkaar dwaara use bechney kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Ironically, this public perception reinforces the political will to sell public property that private entities operate more efficiently
 punah visham soochna ke kaaran niti nirmaataa or aam janata dekhte hai ki ek sarkari swaamitv vaali company jo ek vittiya aapadaa thi - nijee kshetra dwaara chamatkaarik dhang se kuch hi din main uski kaaya palat hi gai
 In a society with too much corruption, privatization allows the currently ruling government and its supporters to dishonor a large portion of the net present value of the assets owned by the public to brokers of their preferred strengths
 nijeekaran ke bina, bhrasht adhikariyon ko samay ke saath dhire dhire apni bhrasht kamai kii fasal kaatani hoti
 atah ek kushal nijeekaran is par nirbhar karata he ki vartmaan sarkari adhikariyon main bhrashtachar kaa vartmaan str bahut kam ho, kyonki isamen bhrasht raashi ke kahin adhik kushal nishkarshan kii sambhaavna hoti he
 Of course, corrupt governments can efficiently extract corrupt earnings in other ways as well - especially by borrowing wildly into the contracts of their much-loved supporters
 Generations of taxpayers have to repay the debt taken by corrupt transfers decades ago
 jaahir he, is kaa parinaam saarvajanik sampatti kii bikri main ho saktaa he
 


 ant main, janata ek aisi sarkaar ke saath rah jaati he, jo un par baari kar lagaati he or badale main kuch nahin detii
 rin vaapasi antarrashtriya samjhauton or imef jaisi agenciyon dwaara lagu kii jaati he
 Infrastructure and maintenance are sacrificed - over time, the country's economic potential deteriorates further
 sahitya kii samiksha se pataa chalata he ki acchhee tarah se waakif upabhoktaaon ke saath pratispardhi udyog, ke saath nijeekaran kii dakshata main lagaataar sudhaar hota he
 Such efficiency gains mean a one-time increase in GDP, but through improved incentives to innovate and reduce costs, there is also a tendency to increase the rate of economic growth
 jin prakaar ke udyogon par yah saamanytah lagu hoti he unamem shaamil hai vinirmaan or khudara bikri
 yadhyapi aamtaur par in dakshata laabhon ke saath saamaajik laagat bhi sambhddha hai,kai arthshaastriyon kaa tark he ki in se sarkaar ke uchit samarthan dwaara punarvitaran or sambhawatah punarprashikshan ke madhyam se nipta ja saktaa he
 In the natural monopoly and public service sectors, the consequences of privatization are much more mixed, because in liberal economic theory, private monopoly behaves much like the public

di
tii
 yaa anya aushadhiyon kaa prayog chikitsak kii sanmati ke anusaar karen
 To get rid of itching and lice, other things do not benefit as much from the above mentioned medicines
 daad par aisa maraham na lagaana chahie, jo twachaa ko haani pahunchaae
 The disease is more commonly seen in sweaty areas
 is kaaran aise sthanon ko powder dwaara sookhaa rakhana chahie
 Also, ointment and powder should be used continuously for some time even after the curing of ringworm
 is rog ke liye abhi ek aisi aushadhi nikali he jo tikia ke rup main khai jaati he
 It is very beneficial for the disease
 ye rog kabhi kabhi pakanevaali khujali ke rup main hote hai or hamaari twachaa par jo jeevanu mitra ke samaan rahete hai, shatru ho jate hai
 Penicillin and sulfa ointment, such as cibazole, are harmful to kill these bacteria
 twachaa par rahanevaale jeevanu adhiktar apane aap hi twachaa ke rog kaa kaaran ho jate hai, jo phode, fusiyon ke rup main prakat hota he
 All these bacteria are hidden in a hiding place, such as a nose
 is kaaran yah aavashyak he ki chikitsa ke samay inpar bhi dhyaan diya jaay
 In the treatment of these diseases, food and medicine should be used
 jis jagah kii twachaa par ye rog prakat hon uski safai kaa puraa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 For these diseases, an ointment, wherein the doctor mixes zinc oxide, hydamon, iodoxiclavin, etc
, should be applied, and the use of sulfa and antibiotics by mouth, or by injection
 madhumeh ke jeevanu atyadhik hanikaarak hote hai or karbonkal rog paidaa karte hai, jisaki chikitsa samajhadaari ke saath or tatkaal kerani chahie, jisase jivan ko koi haani na ho
 Apart from these, there are some other skin diseases, which are caused by very microorganisms
 inamen se ek rog ko gokharu kehete hai
 It is a contagious disease
 isi prakaar kaa ek or rog he, jise harpyszoster kehete hai
 It is not known why it is called a spider
 isamen sharir par chhaale pad jate hai or dard hota hai
 According to age, pain is experienced, that is, children suffer less and elders more
 ek anya rog harpes labielis or progenitellis bhi hota he
 These include blisters on the lips and penis after fever
 abhi tak in rogon ke vishaanuon ko maarane kii koi upyukt aushadhi gyaat nahin ho saki he
 Skin is an external component of the body
 is kaaran anek vastuon kaa prabhaav isapar padataa he
 This effect makes the skin very soft and sensitive and takes the form of eczema, or dermatitis, or urticaria
 in rogon kii uchit chikitsa ke liye yah jaananaa aavashyak he ki twachaa kis cheez se prabhavit hui he
 In the present period, many things affect the skin, among which the barber razor and the radiant things are the main ones
 twachaa hamaare sharir ke liye darpan ke samaan he, jisapar hansee, prasannataa, du:kha tathaa khinnata kaa prabhaav turant padataa he
 The reason for thirst is mental discomfort and sleeplessness
 twachaa par anya angon ke rog kaa bhi prabhaav padataa he, jaise madhumeh or pilia rogon main sharir par khujali ho jaati he
 The effects of the lack of essential substances in food also manifest as various diseases on the skin
 bhinn bhinn rogon ke liye anek davaayen di jaati hai
 New medicines are used every day
 bhinn bhinn aushadhiyon kaa adhik prayog kane se bhi tvagrog hota he, jise drug rash yaa drug chakatta kehete hai
 Skin diseases can also occur due to less sweating
 isi prakaar charbi kii granthi se bhi rog hote hai
 One of these diseases is called Muhansa, which is often seen in young boys and girls
 vastut: yah rog nahin he
 Due to the functioning of the sex glands at this age, the fat glands automatically produce fat
 jisko muhaanse kaa rog he use meetha, mirch tathaa masala kam khaanaa chahie
 Acne should not be scratched
 twachaa par bal bhi hote hai
 Sometimes the hairs of the head get more breakage
 iske liye sir kii safai or kisi sade tel kaa prayog laabhkar siddh hota he
 Sometimes young boys, the hair of the wood turns white at an early age, due to which they remain unhappy
 parantu abhi tak koi aushadhi aisi gyaat nahin ho pai he jiske prayog se yah rog thik ho sake
 Sometimes there is a possibility of causing great harm by applying Khizab etc
 kabhi kabhi sir yaa dadhi ke bal jagah jagah se ud jate hai
 Perhaps the reason for this is anxiety
 yadi rogi ko vishwaas dilaate rahen ki ude hue bal pun: aa jaayenge, to isse laabh hota he
 It is necessary to describe the skin as well as the nail
 nakhun main bhi twachaa ke samaan daad ho sakati he
 Sometimes nail polish breaks the nails quickly or becomes rough
 iske atirikt chintaa bhi twachaa kaa rog paidaa kar detii he
 The whitening of the skin is called white spots
 abhaagyavash isko kodh samajha jaataa he
 This makes the patient more anxious
 is rog main twachaa ko rooyee se chune se bhi sooyee chhedne jaisi pidaa hone lagati he
 But there is no pain in leprosy
 abhi tak is rog kii koi santoshjanak chikitsa gyaat nahin ho saki he
 Tuberculosis germs in the skin also produce dermatophytosis
 isi prakaar upadansh ke dhabbe bhi twachaa par prakat hote hai
 There are some skin diseases that reappear, such as psoriasis, the exact cause of which is unknown
 lupas arethematosus bhi aisa hi rog he
 If treated properly, most skin diseases are cured
 twachaa ke thode hi rog aise hote hai, jinase mrityu hoti he, jaise penfigus 
 In this disease, there are blisters on the body, mouth and secretions
 bhagyavash is rog main cotircesteroid se ek naveen aashaa utpann ho gai he or rog par bahut kuch aadhipaty paa liya gaya he, kintu rogi ko jivan bhar alp maatra main iskaa prayog karte rahanaa chahie
 Cancer can occur in every part of the body
 twachaa main bhi cancer ho saktaa he
 If the disease is diagnosed early and benefits from surgery, deep x-ray, radium or other treatment, then the age of the patient increases
 manushyon kii anuvanshiki main sarvapratham matruvanshi nari yaa mitocandrial eve us agyaat nari ko kehete hai jo aaj ke vishwa main maujuud saare naariyon ore purushon kii nikatatam sanjhi purvaja thi
 All the human matriarchal groups in the world are the first subdivisions of the child of this mother-woman
 vaigyanik anumaan lagaate hai ke yah nari africa ke mahadweep par aaj se 200,000 saal pehle rahaa karata thi
 It is worth noting that research has shown that the first patriarchal men of modern man caste have lived their lives after about 50,000 to 80,000 years from this woman
 angrezi main "sarvapratham matruvanshi nari" ko "mitocandrial eve", "nikatatam saanjhe purvaj" ko "most risant kaaman ancister", "vansh samooh" ko "hapalogrup", "pitruvansh samooh" ko "waahe chromosome hapalogrup" or "matruvansh samooh" ko "amtidiene hapalogrup" kehete hai
 Markhor is a Pakistani Tandoh that resembles a common goat

 It belongs to the goat limelight · It is known in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and some areas of Kashmir

 It means "a snake-eating mountain animal" in Persian
 vaise yah tandoh or saanp kha nahin saktaa xxrep 4 
 jab ye saap nahin kha saktaa to iskaa naam markhor kyon rakhaa gaya he xxrep 4 ? Nahapan was the majestic king of the Kshatra dynasty of ancient India
 iske shasankaal kaa nirdhaaran vivaadaaspad he
 No date is inscribed on its coins
 kuch abhilekhon se aisa gyaat hota he ki isane kisi agyaat sanwat ke iktalisaven or chhiyalisven varsh main shashan kiya
 According to Dubrell, it is referred to as the Vikrami Samvat
 dineshchandra sarkaar is nahpaan ke abhilekhon ke sanwat kaa prarambh 78 i
 main maanate hai
 Thus, the known dates of Nahapan's reign can be set to 119 AD and 125 AD
 nahpaan ke bahut se chaandi or taanbe ke sikke mili hai
 9270 coins of a Zakheera obtained from Joghalthambi which are of Nahapan were re-typed by Gautamiputra Shatakarni
 isse yah pataa chalata he ki nahpaan gautamiputra shatkarni kaa samakaleen tha
 Drinking was suspicious
 is vansh kaa moolsthaan pashchimottar bharat prathit hota he
 Probably this is the reason for the marking of Kharoshthi letters on the coins of Nahapan
 nahpaan ke purvaj kushaanon, yaa pahalwein ke prantiy shaasha ke rup main pashchim bharat kaa shashan karte the or 'kshatrap' kii oopaadhi dhaaran karte the
 The first known king of the Kshatra dynasty, Bhumik, was merely a satrap and did not bear the title of king
 'raja' kii oopaadhi sarvapratham nahpaan ke hi sikkon par milti he jo usee swantatra satta or rajtv kaa parichaayak he
 The full title of Nahapan was ‘rankhokharatas Khatapas’
 lagbhag 119 i
 se lagbhag 125 i
 ke bich nahpaan ne apane rajya kaa atyadhik vistaar kar liya tha
 His daughter Dakshamitra was married to Dinkasut Ushavdat
 nahpaan kaa jamata ushavadaat nahpaan ke samrajyavistaar or shashansanchaalan main bada sahaayak hua tha
 Nahapan sent him to help the Uttamabhadras against the Malavas
 malwon ko parajeet karke ushavadaat pushkarakshetra tak gaya tha or sambhavat: yahan tak nahpaan kii rajasatta kaa vistaar kiya tha
 a record by Amatya Aryaman of Nahapan gives a good introduction to the kingdom of Nahapan
 is tathaa anya abhilekhon se aisa anumaan hota he ki nahpaan kaa shashan govardhan aahaar, maamaal aahaar, dakshin or uttari gujarat, konkan, bhadaunch se sopaara tak, kayur aahaar, prabhas, dashapur tathaa pushkar kshetron par tha
 From the receipt of records, it appears that the Tapti, Banas and Chambal valleys were also in its sphere of influence
 kintu 125 i
 ke lagbhag nahpaan kaa raajnneetik prabhaav ghatane laga
 From those coins of Joghalthambi which were re-typed by Gautamiputra Shatakarni, it is believed that around 125, that is, of unknown date 46, Nahapan would have been defeated by Gautamiputra Shatakarni
 sambhav he ki nahpaan ke shashan kaa ant bhi isi samay ho gaya ho, kyonki iske baad nahpaan ke astitv kaa koi pramaan nahin miltaa
 This fact is also confirmed by the Nashik inscription of Balashree, mother of Gautamiputra Shatakarni
 is abhilekh ke patrut main kaha gaya he ki ne khakharaaton kii satta kaa vinaash kar diya
 
 isi abhilekh main un praanton kaa bhi ullekh he, jo kabhi nahpaan ke adheen the kintu is vijay ke baad gautamiputra shatkarni ke haathon lage
 Vincent Willem van Go was a highly talented painter of the Netherlands whose impressionist paintings have left an indelible mark on 20th-century modern art

 It is a tailless, compound-delta winged aircraft
 iskaa vikaas 'halkaa yudhak vimaan' yaa naamak kaarykram ke antargat hua he jo 1980 ke dashak main shuru hua tha
 The aircraft was officially named Tejas on 4 May 2003 by the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 yah vimaan puraane pad rahe mig-21 kaa sthaan legaa
 Production of a limited series of Tejas began in 2007

 The Indian Air Force is said to need 200 single-seater and two-seater 20 conversion trainers, while the Indian Navy may order 40 single-seater aircraft instead of its Sea Harrier
 tejas ke nausena sanskaran ke vimaanon ke 2009 tak aasmaan main udaan bharne kii ummid thi
 Recent developments suggest that the aircraft will join the Indian Air Force by the end of 2010 or early 2011

 On 1 July 2016, the first Tejas unit of the Indian Air Force was formed, named 'number 45 Squadron IAF Flying Dragors'
 isamen abhi do vimaan sammilit hai
 The LCA program was launched in 1983 for two primary purposes
 pramukh or sabase spasht lakshya bharat ke puraane padate ja rahe mikoyan-gurevitch mig-21 kii jagah lene vaale vimaan kaa vikaas karnaa tha
 The mig-21 has been the mainstay of the Indian Air Force since the 1970s, but the early examples became around 20 years old in 1983
 "laung turm ri-equipment plan 1981" ke jariye yah darj hua ki 1990 ke dashak ke ant tak mig-21 ke seva jivan kaa ant ho jaayegaa or 1995 tak bhartiya vaayu sena ko apane bal kii anumaanit dhanchaagat jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye 40% vimaanon kii kami padegi
 The other main objective of the LCA program was to act as a carrier for the all-round growth of India's domestic aerospace industry
 1947 main swatantraaa milane ke turant baad, bhartiya netaaon ne vimaanan or anya samrik udyogon main aatmanirbharta kaayam karne kaa ek mahatvakankshi rashtriya lakshya nirdhaarit kiya
 The importance of aerospace "self-reliance" initiatives is not only to build an aircraft, but to enable the local industry to manufacture state of art products and equip them with commercial recognition in the global market
 elsie kaarykram kaa uddeshy aadhunik uddyan praudyogikiyon ke vistrut daayre main bharat ke swadeshi airospes kshamtaaon ko or vistaarit karnaa or samunnat karnaa he
 To better meet these goals, the government has decided to adopt a different approach to management and established the Aeronautical Development Agency in 1984 to manage the LCA program
 haalanki, tejas ko aksar hindustan aironautics limited kaa utpaada kaha jaataa rahaa he, par tejas ke vikaas kii jimmedaari vastav main ada kii he, jo 100 se adhik raksha prayogshaalaon, audyogic sanghathanon or academik sansthaanon kaa ek rashtriya sangh he or hieli jiskaa mukhya thekedaar he
 The NDA formally comes under the aegis of the Defense Research and Development Organization of the Indian Ministry of Defense
 elsie ke liye bharat sarkaar kii "aatmanirbharta" ke lakshya main teen sabase parishkrut or sarvaadhik chunauteepurn pranaliyaan- fli bai vir udaan niyantran pranali, bahu aiami pulse-dopalar radar or after burning terbo fain ingine shaamil hai
 Although India follows a policy of severely restricting foreign participation in the LCA program, only in respect of Hieli's key systems has Ada invited significant foreign technical assistance and consultation
 iske alaava, ingine or radar hi keval pramukh pranaliyaan hai, jinke sambandh main kida ne gambhirtha se videshi upkaran pratisthapann kii baat sochi, haalanki yah shuruaati elsie vimaan ke liye uthaaye gayi antarim upaay the, jisamen deshi sanskaran ke purna vikaas ke liye or adhik samay kii jarurut thi, jaisaa ki elsie kaveri bijli sanyantr ke maamle main hua tha
 With a view to achieving self-sufficiency in the field of aviation technologies, the ambition of the LCA program is highlighted by the fact that only three of the top 35 aviation equipment and line replaceable units include foreign systems
 inamen multi function displage sexent or elbit se, helmet-mounted disple and site signal pranali elvit se or lesar pod kii aapurti rafel dwaara aapurtit kii jaati he
 When the LCA reaches the level of production, even Indian companies will probably start supplying mfds out of these three
 kuch anya mahatvapurn upkarnon ke item kaa aayaat kiya gaya he
 As a result of the ban imposed on India after nuclear weapons tests in May 1998, it was originally planned to import several important items, such as landing gear, despite these being developed indigenously
 elsie ke kaarykram kii shuruyaat main kida dwaara pahchaan kii gai paanch mahatvapurn praudyogikiyon, jinaki "puri tarah se swadeshi "ladaaku vimaan kii sanrachana or nirmaan main bharat sakasham ho saktaa tha, main se do puri tarah safal rahe- samunnat carbon-fibre compojit sanrachanaon va skin kaa vikaas or nirmaan or ek aadhunik "glass cockpit

 In the shadow of the problems that have come in the way of the other three major technology initiatives, most of these achievements have not gone unnoticed
 baharhaal, bharat ke gharelu udyogon kii kamyaabiyon ke parinamswaroop elsie ke 70 pratishat purje bharat main ban rahe hai or aane vaale varshon main aaayaatit upkarnon ke upyog par bharat kii nirbharta dhire-dhire kam ho jaayegi
 In 1955, Hieli took on the challenge of an air staff requirement based on the experience gained from the HT-2 program and the manufacturing capabilities gained from the licensed production of the De Havilland Vampire FB
52 and T
55
 isse kai bhoomikaaon vaale ek ladaaku vimaan kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos hui jo zyada oonchai par avarodhan kar sake or kam duuri par rah kar jamini hamale ke liye upyukt ho
 The ASR also required that the infrastructure be suitable as an advanced trainer and for ship operation optimization, although this option was later abandoned
 parinamswaroop bharat ke pehle gharelu viksit jet ladaaku, sabsonic HF-24 maarut kaa nirmaan hua, jisane sabase pehle june 1961 main udaan bhari
 Marut could not be inducted into the Indian Air Force until 1967 due to problems in developing and acquiring a suitable turbojet engine
 Meanwhile, Hieli gained additional experience developing and testing the Holland Genat F
1, which was under production license from 1962 to 1974, which led to a later improved version of the Genat Mk II Ajit HJT-16 Kiran turbojet trainer
 Developed, which was incorporated into service in 1968
 1969 main, bharat sarkaar ne apni aironautics samiti kii is sifarish ko sweekaar kar liya ki hieli ko ek kshamta sabit kar chuke ingine ke saath unnat praudyogiki vaale ladaaku vimaan sanrachana va viksit karne chahie
 'tactical air saport aircraft` ke aadhaar par ASR chihnit rup main maarut jaisaa hi tha
 Hieli then completed a study of the structure in 1975, but the project could not be completed due to an inability to obtain "capability proven engines" selected from foreign manufacturers
 chunki ajit atake vimaan kaa utpaadan jari he, jisase hieli ke ejiniyaron ke liye sanrachana kaa kaam thodaa hi bachaa, jabaki madhyamik hawaii samarthan or avarodhan kshamta ke saath hawa main shreshthata vaale ladaku vimaan kii bhartiya vaayu sena kii aavashyaktaa adhuri hi rah gai
 In 1983 DRDO received permission to undertake a program for the design and development of a light fighter aircraft and thus only this time a different management approach was adopted
 1984 main, elsie kaarykram prabandhan ke liye aironotical deveopment agency sthapit kii gai
 Ada is an effective "national association", with Hieli being a key partner
 hieli praathmik thekedaar ke rup main kaary karata he or uski elsie kii sanrachana, pranali ekikaran, airfrem vinirmaan, vimaan ko antim rup se taiyaar kar, udaan pareekshan, seva se sambandhit samarthan kaa agrani daayitv he

 elsie ke liye bhartiya vaayu sena ke hawaii karmchaariyon kii oktober 1985 tak puri nahin ho pai thi
 This delay led to the dismantling of the original program and the first flight took place in April 1990 and was taken into service in April 1995, however, this delay could prove to be a boon, as it would have made Ada a national R&D and industrial resource, The recruitment personnel got time to sort out the tasks like creating the infrastructure and to get a clear vision, so that the advanced technologies country Switch to the further development and does not need to be imported
 pariyojna paribhaasha oktober 1987 main shuru hui or 1988 ke sitambar main ise puraa kiya gaya
 Dassault Aviation of France was appointed as an advisor to review the PD and provide advice based on its extensive aviation expertise
 vimaan kii sanrachana or vikaas kii prakriya main PD charan ek praarambhik mahatvapurn tatv he, kyonki isse vistrut sanrachana, vinirmaan drushtikon or rakrakhaav sambandhi aavashyaktaaon ke pramukh tatwon ke parinaam nikle
 iske alaava, isi bindu par samgr kaarykram laagat ko sabase prabhavi dhang se niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 The cost of implementing changes in structure requirements, capabilities and facilities increases rapidly and the graph of development tends to fall down compared to the time of commencement and is likely to cost more time and cost to complete the program
 elsie sanrachana ko 1990 main antim rup diya gaya or "relax static stability" ke saath yah ek chote delta pankh vaali mashin ke rup main tha, jisase ki yuddh kaushal main bhoomika badhaai ja sake
 lagbhag turant baad hi uddyan ke electranik upkarnon or unnat samgr dhaanche jaise kuch nirdisht kaarnon se thodi chintaa hui or bhartiya vaayu sena ko andeh hua ki ek aisi mahatvakankshi pariyojna ke samarthan ke liye bharat ke paas paryaapt buniyadi dhaancha he bhi yaa nahin
 may 1989 main ek sarkari samiksha samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya, jisane ek aam raay yah di ki bharat ke paas pariyojna shuru karne ke liye buniyadi dhaanche, suvidhaon or praudyogiki ke adhiktar kshetron main adhik paryaaptta he
 However, as a step of foresight it was decided that the level of development of full-scale engineering of the program would have to proceed in two stages
 charan-ek "avadharana ke saboot" par dhyaan kendrit karegaa or isamen do praudyogiki pradarshak vimaanon kii sanrachana, vikaas or pareekshan or ek sanrachanaatmak namoona pareekshan airfrem kaa gathan shaamil honge or TD vimaan ke safal pareekshan ke baad hi bharat sarkaar elsie sanrachana ko apana puraa samarthan degi
 iske baad do prototip vaahanon kaa nirmaan or vimaan ke liye aavashyak buniyadi dhaanche or pareekshan suvidhaon kaa nirmaan shuru hoga
 duusare charan main teen or prototip vaahanon kaa nirmaan, ek kathin pareekshan namoona or vibhinn kendron par vikaas va pareekshan kii suvidhaayen behaal karnaa shaamil hoga
 Phase-1 began in 1990 and Hieli began work on technology demonstrations in mid-1991, however, due to the financial crisis, full-scale funding was not authorized until April 1993, resulting in Phase 1 work of FSED Started in June
 pehla praudyogiki pradarshak, TD-1, 17 navambar 1995 ko puraa hua or uske baad 17 navambar 1998 main TD-2 puraa hua, lekin kai sanrachanaatmak chintaaon or udaan niyantran pranali ke vikaas main pareshaani ke kaaran inhen kai saal tak jameen par hi rakhaa gaya
 One of the most ambitious requirements for the LCA was the specification "relax Static Stability"
 Although Dassault proposed an analog FCS system in 1988, Ada believed that digital flight control technology would soon replace it
 General Dynamics debuted on the YF-16, which was the first aircraft in the world to be called slightly unstable from an aerodynamic point of view
 adhiktar vimaanon kii sanrachana sthitik sthirataa ke liye "sakaaratmak" thi, jiskaa matlab he ki niyantran jaankaree ke abhaav main unamem ek str par lautne kii prakritikpravriti va niyantrit udaan hoti he
 But this quality is contrary to the skilled efforts of the pilot
 duusari taraf "nakaaratmak" sthitik sthirataa kii suvidha vaala vimaan apane str va niyantrit udaan se alag hat saktaa he, jab tak payalat lagaataar ise santulit karne kaa prayaas nahin karata, haalanki yah gatishiltaa ko badhaata he, par yah bahut kuch payalat par he ki vah ek yantric udaan niyantran pranali par kitna bharosa karata he
 The development of the FBW flight control system demands extensive knowledge of flight control laws and expensive writing on software codes for flight control computers, as well as knowledge of the need for its integration with flight electronic systems and other electronic systems
 jab elsie kaarykram shuru kiya gaya tha, FBW ek atyaadhunik praudyogiki thi or yah itani samvedansheel thi ki bharat ko koi desh nahin mila, jo ise niryaat karne ke liye taiyaar ho
 isliye, bharat kaa apana sanskaran viksit karne ke liye neshnal aironautics prayogshaala ne 1992 main elsie rashtriya niyantran kanoon team kaa gathan kiya gaya
 Scientists and mathematicians in the CLAW team succeeded in developing their control laws, but could not test them, as India did not have advanced "real time ground stimulators" at the time
 tadnusaar, 1993 main british airospes or lochid martin ko madad ke liye bulaayaa gaya, par vaimaaniki vikaas pratishthan ke liye niyantran kanoonon ko FCS software main code karne kaa prayaas pehle kii gai ummid se zyada bada kaam sabit hua
 Problems with specific control laws were investigated in BAE simulators
 haalanki yah viksit karne kii prakriya main tha, isaki koding ke pragatisheel tatwon ko kramash:ade or hieli main "minibard" or "aayranbird" test ring jaanch kii gai
 The second series of simulations were tested during flight on the F-16 VISTA of the integrated flight control software
 july, 1996 main simmulator, 33 pareekshan udaanen bhari gayi
 haalanki, lochid martin kii bhagidaari 1998 main khatm ho gai, kyonki us saal may main bharat ke duusare ke parmaanu pareekshanon ke jawaab main america ne pratibandh laga diya tha
 The CLAW team at NAL was able to successfully complete the integration of flight control laws indigenously, and FCS Software completed a 50-hour pilot test on the TD-1 without interruption, resulting in early 2001 The aircraft was approved for flight
 janvari 2001 ko elsie kii pehali udaan TD dwaara bengalore ke paas banaaye gayi rashtriya udaan pareekshan centre se hui
 iske baad 1 agast 2003 ko isaki pehali safal supersonic udaan hui
 sitambar 2001 main TD-2 ko apni pehali udaan bharne kaa samay mila, 6 june 2002 tak ise yah mauka nahin mil sakaa
 tejas ] Ada's team chose another indigenous technology sector to be indigenously developed, Tejas' multi-dimensional radar
 prarambh main isaki yojana elsie ke liye arikson microwave system PS-05 / AI / J-band multi function radar ke prayog kii thi jise arikson or pherenti raksha pranali ekikaran dwaara saab JAS-39 gripen ke liye viksit kiya gaya tha
 However, after examining other radars in the 1990s, the DRDO became confident that its indigenous development was possible
 hieli ke hyderabad divijan or LRDE ko sanyukt rup se MMR kaarykram ke netritv ke liye chunaa gaya
 Although it is not clear exactly when the structure work will start, the radar development effort started in 1997
 DRDO kaa centre for airborne studies MMR ke liye pareekshan kaarykram chalaane ke liye jimmedaar he
 Between 1996 and 1997, CABS converted the existing Hieli / HS-748M aerial surveillance post testbed into lca's electronic flight system and radar test bed, dubbed the 'hack' and the only major structural change other than the rotodome assembly Also known as LCA, the nose cone of the LCA was prosecuted according to the MMR
 2002 ke tak MMR ke vikaas main deree or laagat main vruddhi kaa anubhav hona bataaya gaya
 In early 2005, testing was confirmed only for air-to-air 'look up' and 'look down' modes - two very basic modes
 may 2006 main yah khulaasa kiya gaya ki pareekshan vaali kai vidhiyon kaa pradarshan abhi bhi "apekshaaon se kam" he
 As a result, Ada reduced weapons tests during flight with a weapon dropping pod, which is not a primary sensor, postponing several critical tests
 pareekshan report ke anusaar, samasya kii jad radar or LRDE dwaara banaaye gayi unnat signal procesar modul ke bich anukulata gambhir mudda he
 Interim options for acquiring Alta's EL / M-2052 such as 'off the Self' foreign radar are being seriously considered
 prarambh main, prototip vimaan ko general electric F404- GE-F2J3 afterburning terbophan ingine se las karne kaa nirnay liya gaya tha
 Simultaneously, in 1986, a parallel program was launched for the development of an indigenous power plant
 gas terbine anusandhan praadhikaran ke netritv main GTRE GTX-35VS, jiskaa naam "kaveri" rakhaa gaya, ke bare main yah ummid kii gai ki vah puri tarah utpaadit vimaan F404 kii jagah legaa
 However, the progress of the Cauvery development program slowed down due to technical difficulties
 2004 ke madhya main, kaveri rus main oonchai pareekshan main asafal ho gai or ise tejas vimaan ke pehle utpaadan ke rup main pesh karne kii antim ummid samaapt ho gai
 The companies were invited by issuing a tender for further development of Kaveri
 farvari 2006 main kida ne kaveri kii samasyaon ko dur karne ke kaam main takneekee sahaayta ke liye francisi vimaan kaa ingine company snisma se anubandh kiya
 At that time, DRDO hoped to have the Kaveri engine ready for use in Tejas by 2009-10
 kaveri ke vikaas main paidaa ho rahi khaamiyon ko dekhte hue 2003 main ucch gunvattta vaale general electric F404, F404-GE-IN20 injanon ko aath purv utpaadit LSP vimaanon or do nausena prototip ke liye kharidne kaa nirnay kiya gaya
 Ada awarded a US $ 105 million contract to an American General Electric in February 2004 to develop and produce 17-IN20 locomotives, which began supply in 2006
 farvari 2007 main, hieli ne ek atirikt F404- GE-IN20 afterburning terbophan ingine kaa aadesh diya, jisase bhartiya vaayu sena ke liye tejas ladaaku vimaan ke pehle parichaalan squadran ko takat di ja sake
 Prior to the timely order, the F404-GE-IN20 was put on trial as a light combat aircraft and was part of the final evaluation of the test flight until mid-2007
 F404-GE-IN20 ingine ne sthapit kiye jane se pehle 19,000 pound sthapit kiye bina thrust arjeet kiya, 330 ghante kaa twarit mishan pareekshan puraa kiya, jo 1000 ghante kii udaan ke baraabar tha
 The IN20 replaced the F2J3 development engines, which carried 600 flights and used eight engines
 sitambar 2008 main, yah ghoshnaa kii gai ki kaveri tejas ke liye samay par taiyaar nahin ho sakegaa or ek aisa bijli sanyantr chunanaa hoga, jo utpaadan prakriya main ho
 kida ke liye 95 se 100 kiloneuton range vaale adhik shaktishaalee ingine ke liye anurodh prastaav jari karne kii yojana he
 Its potential contenders could be Eurojet EJ200 and General Electric F414
 eurojet EJ200 ke pranodan peshkash ko kaaphi joardaar mana gaya he
 The single crystal turbine blade technology, which was originally refused to Indian scientists, was also offered by Eurojet to India through the EJ200 engine
 may 2009 main yah ghoshnaa kii gai ki vimaan ke liye adhik shaktishaalee ingine hasil karne ke liye 3,300 karod rupye kii ek vaishvik nivida jari kii jaayegi, kyonki maujuuda general electric F404 ingine itnaa takat nahin paidaa karte ki kam se kam hathiyaaron ke bhaar ke saath vimaan hamale karne main sakasham ho
 Eurojet Turbo and American company General Electric will compete to supply 100 engines for LCA
 eurojet EJ200 or GE epa-414 ingine bhartiya vayusena kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karenge kyonki ve 95-100 kiloneuton takat utpann karte hai
 Indian Air Force sources also said that the structure of the airframe would be designed in such a way that heavy engines could be installed, which is expected to take three to four years
 haalanki tejas vimaanon ke shuruuaati batch kam shakti vaale general electric F404 injanon dwaara sanchalit honge, jo 80-85 kiloneuton kii takat utpann karte hai
 In December 1996, the then scientific advisor APJ Abdul Kalam calculated and calculated its unit cost at US $ 2
1 million
 2001 ke ant main kida or elsie kaaryakramon ke nideshak dow kota harinarayan ne elsie kii ikai laagat 17 se 20 lakh america dollar aanki or bataaya ki ek baar utpaadan shuru ho gaya to isaki keemat 15 karod america dollar tak ho sakati he
 However, by 2001 others indicated that LCA would cost US $ 24 million
 vartmaan daron par isaki prati vimaan keemat abhi bhi 21
27 million america dollar he
 Considering the increase in cost, some aviation experts believe that when the aircraft comes out, it can cost US $ 350 million per aircraft
 20 tejas vimaanon ke liye 2,000 karod rupee ke aadesh se ek unit kii kharid keemat prayek ke liye 22
6 million america dollar hogi, jo abdul kalam ke anumaanon ke anuroop hogi
 Tejas will be cheaper than other 4

 times of india ke 3 farvari 2010 kii report ke mutabik bharat sarkaar elsie pariyojna ko jivit rakhane ke liye or 8000 karod rupye degi
 The Indian Navy has cleared the order for six naval LCA
 jis par prati vimaan anumaanit laagat 31
09 karod america dollar aayegi
 The delay in development of LCA was mainly attributed to India's lack of experience in designing sophisticated fighter aircraft structure
 bharat ne pehle 1950 ke dashak ke aakhir main keval duusari peedi ke ladaaku vimaan kaa nirmaan kiya tha
 The leap from the second generation to the 4
5 generation could have been a hindrance

 In an interview on May 1, 2006, Hiali Chairman Ashok Baweja said that the fifth prototype vehicles, trainer prototypes and eight LSP aircraft would be supplied before the end of 2006
 ye vimaan elsie ke liye praarambhik parichaalan manjuuri main teji laane kaa kaam karenge
 It is expected that it will join the Indian Air Force by the end of 2006, as the phase of the structure and development of the LCA system is finally being completed in 2010
 ek prashikshak sanskaran kaa bhi vikaas kiya ja rahaa he or nausena sanskaran kii sanrachana puri ho gai he or iske 2008 main udaan bharne kii ummid he
 The LSP-1 made its first flight only in April 2007, while the trainer prototype is not yet supplied
 bhartiya vayusena ke 20 vimaanon ke aadesh ko 2012 ke baad parichaalan manjuuri paane kii ummid hai
 Tejas is currently undergoing flight tests
 ek baar praarambhik aaparating manjuuri milane ke baad ise simit sankhya main bhartiya vaayu sena main shaamil kiya jayega

 The objectives of this team include overseeing the process of joining the LCA, diagnosing any challenges that may arise and helping to optimize the development process of Tejas' operational use, and with it the creation of principles, training programs, maintenance programs , So that the Indian Air Force can rapidly prepare for the operational service of Tejas
 isse bhartiya vaayu sena kii is ichha kaa khulaasa hota he ki vah elsie ke vikaas main or adhik shaamil hone or saath hi saath naye vimaan ko shaamil karne jaldi main he
 This team is stationed in Bangalore
 hieli ke varisht adhikariyon ne march 2005 main kaha tha ki bhartiya vaayu sena 20 tejas vimaanon ke liye 2,000 karod rupee ke aadesh nirgat karegaa or iske baad or 20 vimaanon kii kharid hogi
 All 40 will be equipped with F404-GE-IN 20 engines

 24 farvari 2010 ko bharat sarkaar dwaara haal hi main jari ek press vijyapti main bataaya gaya ki elsie tejas march 2011 tak bhartiya vaayu sena main shaamil hoga
 In addition to the above contract of 20 LCA, the proposal for purchase of additional 20 LCA final operational clearance configuration is in progress
 elsie ke vinirdesh bhartiya vaayu sena dwaara taiyaar vaayu seva jaruraton ke anusaar hai
 Tejas Mark-2 is also likely to be developed due to the inability of Mark-1 to meet the requirements of the Indian Air Force staff
 bhartiya vaayu sena 2005 main jari kiye ja chuke 40 vimaanon ke aadesh ke alaava kisi bhi mark-1 vimaanon kaa aadesh nahin degi
 jab phir se sanrachana kiye gayi mark-2 viksit honge to 125 vimaanon tak ke ek aadesh par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 According to a spokesperson of the Indian Air Force, the Mark-2 will have more powerful engines, sophisticated aerodynamics and other upgrades to reduce the number of obsolescent devices
 bhartiya nausena ke mark-2 tejas sanskaran ek vimaan vaahak pot se bahut kam samay main udaan bharne or utarane main sakasham honge
 The naval version of the Tejas is expected to be ready soon
 nausena pramukh admiral nirmal verma ne nausena ke apane pehle saptaahik samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha ki 2009 disambar tak DRDO ne aashwaasan diya he ki elsie kaa nausena sanskaran 2013 tak vaahak pareekshan ke liye taiyaar ho jayega or gorshkove / vikramaditya or saath hi bhartiya vimanavahak poton par tainaati ho sakegi
 He said the Navy was conducting a 'conceptual study' for more capable carrier aircraft for the IAC-2
 "nausainik ke elsie sanskaran" kii visheshtaon main se kuch : The Tejas is a jet fighter aircraft with a single engine and various roles, featuring tailless and compound delta wing platforms and with a "relaxed statics stability" structure, which helps increase aircraft maneuvers
 mul rup se isaki seva jamini hamale kii bhoomika ke saath madhyastareey "mook bam" ke rup main hawa main shreshthata sabit karne vaale vimaan ke rup main lene kaa makasad rakhaa gaya, par sanrachana sambandhi najariye main lacheelepan kii vajah se yah hawa se sataha or nauvahan-virdohi hathiyaar ke rup ekikrut ho saktaa he, jisase yah kai tarah kah bhoomika or kai tarah ke mishan puraa karne kii kshamta hasil kar saktaa he
 The structure of the tailless and compound delta planforms is to keep tejas short and light
 is planfarm kaa upyog niyantran sataha jaruraton ko kam se kam rakhata he, vyapak shrenee ke bahari store ke vahan kii ijaajat detaa he or crucifarm sanrachana kii tulana main behatar kareebi muqabla karne, ucch gati or ucch alpha bhoomikaaon kii visheshta vaala hota he
 Wing tunnel test models and complex computational fluid dynamics analysis on a large-scale scale model have minimized the aerodynamic configuration of LCA, allowing it to achieve minimal supersonic drag, low wing loading, and high rates of roll and pitch
 sabhi hathiyaaron ko prayek shakha main ek yaa ek se adhik 4,000 kilo kii kul kshamta ke saath saat hardpaints ke saath dhoya jaataa he : har wing ke tahat teen stesan or ek fuzleg centerline par hota he
 There is also an eighth portside intake trunk under offset station, which can carry a variety of pods and under-fuseleg stations to centerline stations and inboard pairs of wing stations
 tejas main abhinn aantarik eendhan tanks hota he, jo fuzleg or wing main 3,000 kilo eendhan rakh saktaa he or aage fuzleg starboard kii ore ek nishchit infite eendhan bharne vaala phixd upkaran hota he
 Externally inboard and midboard wing stations and centerline fuseleg stations have "weight" hardpoint provisions of up to three 1,200 or five 800-liter fuel tanks
 elsie aluminium-lithium mishra dhaatu, carbon fibre compojit or titanium mishra dhaatu-stells se bana he
 C-FC supplies up to 45% of its airframe as Tejas weight, including a fuselage wing, XI tailfin, rudder, air brakes and landing gear doors
 sabhi dhaatu sanrachana kii tulana main sammishran vaale dhaatuon kaa upyog vimaan ko halkaa or majboot donon banaata he or elsie c-fcs kaa niyojan pratishat apni shrenee ke samakaleen vimaanon main ek sarvocch he
 In addition to making the aircraft very light, there are minimal joints or spikes, which increases the reliability of the aircraft and reduces the possibility of cracks resulting from structural weakness
 elsie ke liye telphin ek akhand madhukosh ke tukade jaisaa he, jo "sabatractive" yaa "didctive" pranali kii tulana main utpaadan laagat ko 80% tak kam kar sakati he
jiskaa shaft ek computarikrut ank niyantrit mashin dwaara titanium mishra dhaatu ke ek block se nikaala jaataa he
 No other manufacturer has succeeded in making the outer wing out of a single piece of metal
 radar ke liye'ek naak' keel ghumaakar jodi jaati he
 The use of alloys in the LCA reduced the total number of devices by 40% compared to the use of metal frames
 In addition, the number of accelerating devices decreased by half from 10,000 in alloy structures whose metal The frame structure was required
 samgr sanrachana se ek or madad mili ki airfrem main 2,000 chhed nahin karne pade
 kul milakar, is vimaan vajan 21% se kam he
 One of these factors can be reduced production costs, an additional benefit - and significant cost savings - realized in the expected time to assemble the small aircraft - seven months for the LCA as against 11 months of an all-metal airframe
 Use tejas ke nausainik sanskaran ke airfrem main naak ke jhukaav ke sambandh main sanshodhan kiya jaayegaa taaki vimaan utaarne ke samay drishy ko or behatar kiya ja sake auraudane ke dauraan gati or badhaane ke liye or wing leading age vortex controlrs kaa upyog kiya jaayegaa
 LEVCON niyantran satahon par kaam karte hai jo wing root leading age se vistaarit hote hai or is tarah elsie ko dhimi gati ke dauraan behatar tareeke se sanchalit kiya ja saktaa he nahin to khinchaav badhane ke kaaran theda baadhit hota he, jaisaa ki delta wing sanrachana main hota he
 An additional benefit is that LEVCON also increases the ability to control at high angles of attack
 nausainik tejas kii ridh vaala hissaa bhi majboot, ek lanbaa or majboot pahiyevaala or deck par gatishiltaa ke liye noj hvil stearing hota he
 The trainer version of the Tejas is of "aerodynamic commonality" with a two-seater naval aircraft structure

 Tejas' aerodynamic configuration is based entirely on the delta-wing layout with shoulder mounted wings
 iske sabhi niyantran satahon jalchaap se sanchalit hai
 The outer edges of its wing are three-section slats, while the inner sections are fitted with additional slats to create a vortex lift in the inner wing and high-energy aerial flow along the tail fin, allowing higher aoa stability
 To be extended and to abort the process of detachment from controlled flight
 The trailing edge of the wing consists of two segments elevating the plane, which controls the pitch and the elevation process
