 kalpana kii maansik prakriya ke atanrgat vastav main do prakaar kii maansik prakriyaayein nihit hai – pratham, vigat samvedansheeltaaon kaa pratismaran, bimbon evam vichaaron ke rup arthath smriti, dwitiya, un pratismrit anubhavon kii ek nae sangyojan main rachana
 But in imagination there is so much combination of both these types of actions that neither they can be studied separately nor can they have different distinct sensations
 isi kaaran kalpana ko ek ucchstareey jatil prakaar kii maansik prakriya kaha jaataa he
 The nature of mental processes of imagination and thinking are so similar that in ordinary language they are sometimes used as synonyms
 samanta kii drushti se, donon hi kriyaaon main vigat anubhavon kaa pratismaran tathaa unak nayaa sangyojan taiyaar karnaa he, evam donon kii kriyaayein vyakti kii asantusht aavashyaktaaon or ichchhaaon kii santushti kaa maarg khojane ke liye utpann hoti hai
 But both have different objectives
 kalpana avastavik, ataarkik evam kaalpanik rachanaatmak hal aavashyaktaaon kii santushti ke liye khojati he, chintan kaa uddeshy hameshaa taarkik evam vaastavik hal khojna he or isiilie ise taarkik kriya ke naam se bhi pukaara jaataa he
 The process of contemplation will not begin until a real problem is present in the path of satisfaction of needs
 lekin kalpana avastavik or kaalpanik samasyaon kii upasthiti se bhi prarambh ho sakati he
 Imagination is also divided into two types
 pratham prakaar kii kalpana ke antargat divaswapn or maansik udaanen aati hai jinaki sahaayta se vyakti ek kaalpanik jagat kaa nirmaan karata he, jo vaastavik jagat kii tulana main uski aavashyaktaaon kii santushti ke liye adhik mahatvapurn ho jaataa he
 All ordinary people benefit from this type of imagination and protect themselves from the mental ill effects of their physical inability
 kintu is prakaar kii kalpana kii barambharataa maansik rogiyon kaa ek pradhan lakshan ban jaati he jiske falswaroop vicitra bhramon kaa nirmaan hota he
 The second type of imagination is called the creative name, under which imaginary flights are counted by which literary, artistic scientists, creative works are made
 sarjanaatmak rachanaayen pratibhashali vyakti hi kar pate hai
 Analyzing creative imagination, the genius Helmholts, Pawnbroker, Graham Wallace, etc
, have described its four stages - preparation, elimination, elimination and quantification
 pratham avasthaa main srujankarta vibhinn tathyon tathaa nirikshanon ko ek ekachitr karke apni samasya or uddeshy kii vaastaviktaa kii pariksha karata he
 In the second stage there is no visible progress, but, in fact, the internal thinking of various subconceptions goes on
 sabase mahatvapurn teesri avasthaa hi he jisamen daivi prerana si praapt hoti he or srijan kaary ho jaataa he
 If this creation work is in the form of a scientific sub-concept, then it has to prove its truth and, if it is a literary or artistic creation work, then it has to be personified with its own publication medium
 manovaigyanik rausaman, manake, tathaa plate or baker, ne anusandhankartaaon evam vaigyanikon se, evam si
 patric mahodaya ne kaviyon evam chitrakaaron se jo tathy praapt kiye hai ve sarjanaatmak kalpana kii in chaaron avasthaaon kaa samarthan karte hai
 There are also two types of theories regarding the physical basis of imagination - first, according to the central theory, which is the ancient theory, imagination is based on complex functions of the brain and is a part of it
 doosraa, prerak yaa paridhi siddhant ke naam se prasiddh he jiske anusaar kalpana chunki ek vyavhaar he isliye iske antargat bhi saadhaaran vyavhaar kii hi bhanti gyanendriyon, mastishk tathaa mansapeshiyon kii shareerik kriyaayein hoti hai
 This theory has been supported by various psychological experiments by Jacobson, Max, Sha, Aserinsky, and Kalaimatman, etc
 and this theory is becoming more valid by the day

 African wild elephants and African bush elephants can mutually breed, although such opportunities are rarely found due to their different settings in the forest

 On the one hand, the trunk of an elephant is so sensitive that even a straw of grass picks up, on the other hand it is so strong that the tree twigs are also uprooted
 adhikansh shaakaahaari pashuon ke daanton kii sanrachana is prakaar kii hoti he ki vah paudhe ke vibhinn bhaagon ko kaat-faad saken
 Whereas, apart from the sick and very young children in elephants, the elephant first tore food from its trunk and then carries that morsel into its mouth
 vah sound ke dwaara ghaas charata he yaa phir upar ped se pattiyaan, fal yaa samoochee shakhayein tod letaa he
 If the food in the tree is beyond the reach of its trunk, then the elephant wraps its trunk in the trunk or branch of the tree and shrugs loudly so that the fruit etc
 drips down or sometimes the entire tree is uprooted
 hathi sound kaa istemaal pani pine ke liye bhi karata he
 The elephant first draws about 14 liters of water in its trunk at once and then pours it into its mouth
 nahaane ke liye bhi hathi isi vidhi kaa istemaal karata he
 After bathing, the elephant sprinkles mud from the trunk in its wet body which after drying takes the form of a crust on its skin and protects it from strong sunlight and parasites

 The relatives will wrap their trunks and greet each other, as humans do with folded hands
 iskaa istemaal vah khel karte hue kushti main, milan se pehle, maan tathaa bachche ke sambandh main tathaa anya kaaryakalapon main bhi karte hai
 a raised trunk may be a warning or a threat, while a trunk lying down with its head can be a sign of surrender
 dushman ko hathi apni sound se lapetakar phenk saktaa he
 The trunk of an elephant has many times more olfactory power than a human being and he finds its food source, friend and foe by raising its trunk up and waving like a right-left marine telescope

 Elephants continue to grow throughout the life of an elephant

 They have 28 teeth throughout their life

 lagbhag ek varsh kii aayu main hathidaant ke agragami doodh ke daant jhad jate hai or hathidaant ugane lag jate hai
 But chewing teeth are about five times the age of an elephant or very rarely six
 ek baar main keval chaar chabane vaale daant, ek-ek donon jabadon ke donon taraf, prayog main laaye jate hai 
 Unlike human teeth, hard teeth do not push the milk teeth upwards
 varan naye daant mukh ke pichley bhaag main ugte hai tathaa puraane daanton ko aage kii taraf dhakelte hai jahaan puraane daant tut-tut kar gir jate hai
 The first group of teeth chewed from birth are present in African elephants
 jab shaavak do varsh kaa hota he to donon jabadon ke donon taraf kaa pehla chabane vaala daant gir jaataa he
 The same process occurs at the age of six with a group of other chewing teeth
 13 se 15 varsh kii aayu tak teesraa daanton kaa samooh bhi jaataa rahata he, tathaa chauthaa samooh 28 varsh kii aayu main jhad jaataa he

 na keval lotna saamaajikaran ke liye ahm he balki mitti dhuparodhak kaa kaam bhi karti he or uski twachaa ko parabangnee kirnon se bachaati he
 Elephant's skin is sensitive despite being harsh
 yadi vah niyamit rup se mitti kaa snaan na kare to uski twachaa ko jalane se, kitdansh se or nami nikal jane se kaafii nuqasaan ho saktaa he
 Rolling in the soil helps the skin to control the body temperature of the elephant
 hathi ko apni twachaa se sharir kii garmi nikaalane main mushkil hoti he, kyonki sharir ke anupaat main twachaa bahut kam hoti he
 The ratio of the weight of an elephant to the surface area of its skin is much greater than that of humans

 Elephant's feet have the same texture as thick pillars or pillars
 hathi ko apni sidhi taangon or bade gaddedaar pairon kii vajah se khadey rahane main mansapeshiyon se kam shakti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 For this reason, elephants can stand for long periods without getting tired
 vastav main, africa haathiyon ko shaayad hi kabhi lete hue dekha jaataa ho, saamanyat: ve biimaar yaa ghayal hone par hi letate he
 In contrast, Asian elephants often like to lie down
 hathi ke pair lagbhag gol hote hai
 African elephants have three nails on each hind leg and four nails on each front foot
 bhartiya haathiyon ke prayek pichley pair par chaar nakhun or prayek saamne ke pair par paanch nakhun hote hai
 Beneath the bones of the foot is a hard, mucous substance that acts as a mattress or shocker
 hathi ke vazan se pair phool jaataa he, lekin vazan hat jane se yah pehle jaisaa ho jaataa he
 For this reason, the elephant easily pulls out its legs, despite being deeply trapped in the wet soil

 kisi nikaay kii kul urja kaa vah bhaag jise upyog main nahin laayaa ja saktaa, us nikaay kii entropy kehalaati he
 The mathematical definition of entropy is given below
 germany ke ganitagya evam bhautikashastri rudolph classias ne 1850 ke dashak main entropy kii sankalpana di or uskaa yah naam diya
 In 1877 Ludwig Boltzmann gave a definition based on probability of entropy
 ooshmaagatiki ushmagatiki ke dwitiya niyam dwaara bhi ek nae sankalpana kaa samavesh hota he
 This is the concept of entropy
 anya sankalpanaaon kii apeksha adhik amoort hone ke kaaran isko samajhnaa bhi adhik kathin he
 The main things about entropy are given below- ooshmaagatikeey rup se vyutkramntic kisi nikaay ke liye entropy main parivartan nimnlikhit sambandh dwaara paribhaashit he- Where t is the absolute temperature of the body, dq is the heat given to the body
 entropy kii yah paribhaasha kabhi-kabhi 'vyashtigat paribhaasha' kehalaati he
 Note that this is the definition of 'change in entropy', not of total entropy
 entropy kii sankalpana bahut upyogi paayi gayi he or isaki kai anya paribhaashaayen or bhi hai
 Later on, the definition of absolute entropy was also based on statistical mechanics or on the third law of thermodynamics
 yadi kisi prakriya main taap aparivartit ho to Using the above definition of entropy and the equation of ideal gas, the following relation can be derived- yaa, Where γ = cpc v { \ displaystyle \ gamma = { \ frac {c_ {p}} {c_ {V}}} \ ,} 1890 se 1900 kii kalavadhi main austria ke bhautikashastri ludwig boltzman or anya vaigyanikon ne sankhyikeey yantriki kaa vikaas kiya
 This greatly influenced the concept of entropy
 entropy or ooshmaagatikeey prayikta main nimnlikhit sambandh diya gaya he- Where s is the entropy, k is the Boltzmann constant, ω is the number of all possible micro-states of the body
