 The Battle of Koregaon was fought on 1 January 1818 at Koregaon Bhima, between the British East India Company and the Peshwa faction of the Maratha Empire
 bajirao dwitiya ke netritv main 28 hajaar maraathon ko pune par akraman karnaa tha
 On the way, he was confronted by a contingent of 800 soldiers going to Pune to strengthen the company's military power
 peshwa ne koregaanv main tainaat is company bal par hamalaa karne ke liye 2 hajaar sainik bheje captain francis stonton ke netritv main company ke sainik lagbhag 12 ghante tak date rahe
 Ultimately, the possibility of the arrival of a large British force led by General Joseph Smith led to the retreat of the Maratha forces
 angrejo kii foot daalo or raaj karo kii niti kaa ye ek or udhaaharan tha
 Company soldiers of Indian origin consisted mainly of the Mahar Regiment soldiers belonging to the Bombay Native Infantry, and hence the Mahars consider this war a heroic episode of their history
 1800 ke dashak tak, maraathon ko ek dhili sahabhaagita main sangathit kiya gaya, jisamen pramukh ghatak pune ke peshwe, gwalior ke sindhiya, indore ke holkar, baroda ke gaekwad or nagpur ke bhosle the
 The British converted and signed peace treaties with these factions, establishing residences on their capitals

 This Treaty of Pune formally ended the Peshwa's suzerainty over other Maratha chiefs, thus officially ending the Maratha Confederacy
 
 iske turant baad, peshwa ne pune main british racidensi ko jala diya, lekin 5 november 1817 ko pune ke paas khadki ke yuddh main parajeet kiya gaya tha
 The Peshwas then fled from Satara, and company forces gained complete control of Pune
 pune ko karnal charles barton barr ke tahat rakhaa gaya tha, jabaki general smith ne ek british sena ke netritv main peshwa ko apanaaya tha
 Smith feared that the Marathas might escape the Konkan and capture the small British contingent there
 isliye, unhone karnal bor ko nirdeshit kiya ki vah konkan ko sena bhej sake, or badale main, aavashyak hone par shirur se sainikon ke liye bulaayen
 Meanwhile, the Peshwa managed to escape beyond Smith's pursuit, but his south advance was forced by the company led by General Theophilus Pritler
 uske baad unhone apane maarg ko badal diya, purvottar kii ore se nasik kii ore uttar-pashchim kii ore jane se purv kii ore agrasar ho gaya
 To realize that General Smith was in a position to stop him, he suddenly went south towards Pune

 The Maratha army ceased firing and left the village by nine o'clock, driven by the fear of approaching the British military forces under General Joseph Smith
 raat main, company ke sainikon ne pani kii aapurti karne main kaamyaab rahe
 The Peshwa remained near Koregaon the next day, but did not make another attack Captain Staunton, who was not aware of General Smith's advance, believed that the Peshwa would attack the Company's troops on the koregaon-pune route

 According to MS Naravane, "the valor shown by a small number of company soldiers against a vast number of Maratha army is rightly considered the most glorious example of valor and patience in the history of company armies
 " Neither side won a decisive victory in the war
 yuddh ke kuch samay baad, mountstuart elfinston ne ise peshwa ke liye "choti si jeet" bataaya
 Nevertheless, the government of the East India Company praised the bravery of its soldiers, who, despite being small in number, persisted

 Lev Trotsky was a Marxist revolutionary and theorist of Russia, a Soviet politician and the founder and first leader of the Red Army
 roosi kranti ke baad hue bheeshan grih yuddh main vijayi rahi laal sena kii kaman trotski ke haath main hi thi
 As a theorist, he contributed to Marxist discourse through the theory of permanent revolution
 iske saath hi trotski ne ek niyam kaa pratipaadan bhi kiya ki poonjeewaad ke vikaas kaa str sabhi jagah ek sa nahin hota jiskaa parinaam pichde deshon main saamaajik or aitihaasik vikaas ke do charnon ke ek saath ghatit ho jane main nikalataa he
 This theoretical achievement of Trotsky in the first decade of the twentieth century amid the ongoing debate among Marxists reinforced the logic of revolutionizing an industrially backward country like Russia
 lenin ke dehanth ke baad trotski ne stallin dwaara pravartit ek desh main samaajwaad kii sthapana ke siddhant kaa virodh kiya, lekin ve party ke bheetar hone vaale sangharsh main akele padate chale gayi
 He was first expelled from the party, and then deported for conspiring against the Soviet state
 nishkasana ke dauraan trotski ne stallin ke netritv main ban rahe soviet sangh kii kadi aalochana karte hue use naukarshah, nirankush or rajkeey poonjeewaadi rajya kii sangya di
 Wandering around the world to escape the Soviet secret police, Trotsky composed classic texts such as 'permanent Revolution', 'revolution Bitred' and 'the History of Russian Revolution' in three volumes
 vishwa-kranti ke apane sapane ko dharti par utaarne ke liye unhone chauthe communist international kii sthapana bhi kii jise koi khaas kamyaabi nahin mili
 During the expulsion, he lost his life at the hands of a Stalin agent in Mexico
 trotski ke anuyaayiyon ne duniya ke kai deshon main choti- choti communist partiyaan bana rakhi hai
 His ideas have been labeled Trotskyism as an alternative to Soviet-style communism
 trotski kaa asli naam lev davidovich bronstin tha
 At an early age he was attracted to Marxism and while doing underground politics adopted the secret name of 'trotsky'
 unke jivan ko teen bhaagon main baant kar dekha ja saktaa he
 The first part is when, like an independent sign of Russian Marxism, he came close to Lenin while participating in the revolutionary movement and then refused to support him
 doosraa hissaa 1917 se shuru ho kar 1923 tak chalaa jab unhone lenin ke saath kandhe se kandhaa mila kar soviet kranti ko agrgati pradaan kii
 After this, the third phase of his life began when he waged a campaign against Stalinism to defend the benefits of the revolution
 bolshevik netaaon main keval trotski hi aise the jinhen lenin kaa pramukh saathi hone ke baavjood unke anuyaayi ke taur par nahin dekha jaataa tha
 In 1903, when the Russian Social People's Labor Party split between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, Trotsky did not support Lenin
 shuruyaat main unhone bolshavism kii yah kah kar ninda kii ki yah to sarvhaara kii nahin balki sarvhaara par taanaashaahee kaa formula he
 At that time he suspected that there were conspiratorial leaders like Lenin Robespierre because of which Russia's socialist movement would be misguided
 us samay trotski kaa vichaar tha ki gupt raajnneetik kaam karne vaali peshewar krantikariyon kii anushaasit party ke haath main kranti kii kaman dene se samaajwaad kaa lakshya nahin hasil kiya ja saktaa
 He was in favor of forming a party of a more democratic and open character
 1905 main ve saint petersburg kii soviet netaa ke rup main ubhare
 This first Soviet of Russia played a major role in the 1905 revolution, and Trotsky considered it a model of authentic democracy
 kranti vifal ho jane ke baad zaarshahi ne unhen giraftaar karke siberia bhej diya
 Trotsky escaped and spent the next decade in Europe
 is dauraan santhnik rup se ve menshavikon ke saath rahe
 When he returned to Russia in 1917, the Zarashahi had collapsed due to the February revolution
 ab ve bolshevikon ke saath aa gayi kyonki unhen laga ki unke or lenin ke vichaaron main kaaphi samanta aa chuki he
 Lenin himself was an admirer of Trotsky's political and theoretical abilities
 bolshevik party main trotski kaa kad teji se badha
 He participated in peace talks with the Germans as the commissioner of foreign affairs
 faujee kamisar ke rup main trotski ne laal sena ke gathan main pramukh bhoomika nibhaai or grih yuddh main uskaa shandaar netritv kiya
 These successes led to Trotsky being viewed as one of Lenin's possible successors
 lenin kii hi tarah trotski ko roosi sarvhaara varg kii rachanaatmak kshamtaaon main gaharaa vishwaas tha
 Based on this belief, he had a special kind of theoretical understanding that came out of the study of world capitalism
 trrotski kaa vichaar tha ki apane pichhadepan se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye kisi desh ko un charnon se kramvaar guzarane kii jarurat nahin hoti jinase viksit desh guzar chuke hote hai
 Symptoms of backwardness emerge along with backwardness in these countries
 is siddhanth ke aadhaar par vishleshan karte hue trotski ne dikhaaya ki rus kaa adhikansh bhaag pichhadaa or aviksit he lekin usamen pashchimi prabhaavon ne bhi ghuspaith kar lee he
 Developed methods of economic production and relations are being adopted in many places
 audyogic vikaas ke in mukaamon ne shahari kendron main ek acha-khaasaa sarvhaara varg or ek pashchimikrut bauddhik abhijan paidaa kar diya he
 As a result, radical forms of political resistance and activism have become prevalent
 chunki udyogikaran upar se thopa gaya he isliye sthaneey poonjipati varg kamjor he, lekin sarvhaara varg majboot he
 The capitalist class is afraid of carrying out a democratic revolution and is unable to fulfill its historical obligation due to its inability, hence this responsibility has fallen on the shoulders of the proletariat
 kisaanon ko apane netritv main lete hue unke saath morcha bana kar majdoor varg ko samantshahi or uske sabhi avasheshon kaa unmoolan karte hue samaajwaad kii taraf badhanaa hoga
 Trotsky called his theory a permanent revolution
 1850 main marks communist lig kii general concil ko sambodhit karte hue is pad kaa istemaal kar chuke the
 According to Trotsky, farmers with a pre-capitalist mindset will not be able to support the workers in this revolutionary process for very long
 unki dilchaspee jameen kaa malikana mil jane tak hi rahegi
 a front made with farmers that paves the way for revolution will prove to be a hindrance in the creation of socialism
 isliye ek desh main, visheshtah rus main, samaajwaad kaa nirmaan tab tak safal nahin ho saktaa jab tak anya deshon main bhi kranti nahin ho jaati
 Therefore, the Russian Revolution should be seen as the initial phase of the world revolution, especially in developed countries
 dilachasp baat yah he ki trotski kii in baton or pratham vishwayuddh ke baad lenin dwaara pratipaadit kai siddhanton main kaafii samanta prathit hoti he
 Some Trotskyists have also alleged that Trotsky's principles were used by Lenin in the 1917 revolution
 yah alag baat he ki khud trotski ne 1917 main lenin kaa netritv sweekaar karne ke baad kabhi aisa nahin kaha
 After Lenin's death, Stalin wrote a paper about the construction of socialism in a country
 is maamle main bukharin jaise siddhantkaar bhi stallin ke saath the
 But Trotsky warned that the implementation of this principle would have disastrous consequences for Russia
 unhone kaha ki kheti ke samuhikeekaran kaa samay abhi nahin aayaa he
 Trotsky was also against limiting the comintern established by Lenin to the tools of Soviet foreign policy
 unka tark tha ki soviet sangh ko udyogikaran or aadhunikeekaran ke raste par jarur chalanaa chahie, par in uplabdhiyon ko samaajwaad kaa paryaay nahin samajha ja saktaa
 Socialism means higher productivity of labor, consequently better standard of living and society like the most developed forms of its capitalism
 yah tabhi ho saktaa he ki jab sarvhaara ke haath main vishwa-arthvyavastha kii bagdor ho
 Trotsky maintained that the Soviet system under Stalin should only be considered transitional
 abhi is baat kii guarantee nahin kii ja sakati ki iskaa vikaas samaajwaad main hoga yaa yah patit ho kar poonjeewaad ke kisi sanskaran main badal jaaegi
 Trotsky believed that the bureaucracy of Russia was taking the form of a new class
 bhale hi soviet samaaj rajkeey poonjeewaad kii sthiti main na pahunchaa ho, lekin uski sthiti mazdooron ke ek kamatar rajya jaisi to he hi
 The special feature of Trotsky's ideas was that he was opposed to the tendencies of seeing Marxism as the infallible medicine of every problem
 isi tarah ve marxvad ke naam par kala-sahitya or gyaan ke vibhinn kshetron ko ek vishesh disha main dhakele jane ke bhi khilaaf the
 Despite his radical views, he could not do a majority of the party in his favor
 party ke bheetar unhen ek aise netaa ke rup main dekha jaataa tha jo sankat aane par to karishmai netritv pradaan kar saktaa he, lekin party ke bheetar hone vaali rosemara kii uthaa-patake se nibatane main dilchaspee nahin rakhata, or jo apni bauddhik chamak-damak main akelaa rahanaa pasand karata he
 When there was no revolution in Europe as Trotsky had hoped, he blamed the Stalinian project of abandoning the goal of world revolution and trying to build socialism in only one country
 trotski ne yah kabhi nahin mana ki stalinkaaleen galatiyon kii jad main party or raajnneeti kaa leninist-bolshevik vichaar he jiske kaaran ek party dwaara sanchalit rajya puure samaaj ko apana taabedaar banane main kaamyaab ho gaya he
 Indeed, Trotsky never reiterated his harsh criticisms of Lenin and Bolshevism from 1903 to 1914, even though he suffered expulsion in the third period of life

" 14 may 2008 ko, america aantarik vibhaag ne dhruviya bhaaluu ko luptpraaya prajati adhinium ke antargat ek luptpraaya prajati ke rup main soochibaddh kiya
 John Phipps, the constatin, was the first to describe the polar bear as a distinct species
 unhone ursus marietimas kaa vaigyanik naam chunaa, jo 'samudri bhaaluu' kaa latin rup he, jo is jaanavar ke deshi awaas se prerit he
 The Inuit designate this animal as Nanuk, in the Chukchi language this bear is Umka

 french main, dhruviya bhaaluu ko avars blonk ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he yaa ours polaire 
 norway prashasit swalbard dweepasmooh main, dhruviya bhaaluu ko Isbjørn kaha jaataa he
 Formerly, polar bears were thought to be in its own genus Thalarctos

 The bear family Ursidae, it is believed, split 38 million years ago from other carnivores

 jeevashm or DNA, donon ke saboot ke anusaar, dhruviya bhaaluu, bhure bhaaluu, ursus arctose se lagbhag 150,000 saal pehle alag ho gaya
 The oldest known fossil of the polar bear is a jawbone between 130,000 and 110,000 years old, which was found on Prince Charles Foreland in 2004
 jeevashm se pataa chalata he ki das se bees hazaar saal pehle ke bich, dhruviya bhaaluu kii dadh bhure bhaaluu ke daanton se kaaphi badal gaya
 The polar bear is thought to have diverged from the brown bear population during a period of glaciation in the Pleistocene

 In addition, polar bears may interact with brown bears for the origin of fertile brown polar hybrid bears, indicating that they have recently separated and are genetically identical
 chunki donon prajatiyon main se koi bhi ek-duusare ke paristhitiki sthaan par zyada din jinda nahin rah saktaa or kyonki unka akruti vigyaan, chayapachay, saamaajik vyavhaar or khan-paan or anya prarupi visheshtaayen alag hai, donon bhaaluon ko aam taur par bhinn prajatiyon ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 When the polar bear was originally documented, two subfamilies were identified: Ursus maritimus maritimus, in 1774 by Coustatin J
 Phipps, Ursus maritimus marinus in 1776 by Peter Cimon Palus
 This distinction has since become invalid

 While their presence at 88 ° north is rare, there is evidence that they extend from the entire Arctic southward to James Bay, Canada

 The global population of polar bears is difficult to estimate because their range has not been fully studied, although biologists estimate there to be around 20,000–25,000 polar bears worldwide

 Subpopulations exhibit seasonal fidelity to particular regions, but DNA studies suggest that they are not reproductively isolated

 The Eurasian population is divided into subpopulations of East Greenland, the Barents Sea, the Kara Sea, the Laptev Sea, the Chukchi Sea, although there is considerable uncertainty about the composition of these populations due to limited mark and recapture data

 Modern methods of tracking polar bear populations have been implemented since the mid-1980s and are expensive to use consistently over large areas
 dhruviya bhaaluu kii sabase sateek ginati karne ke liye aavashyak he, arctic jalwaayu main unhen khojane ke liye helicopter se udaan bharna, bhaaluu ko shant karne ke liye us par trankvilliser dart daagna or uske baad tanging karnaa

 Scientists responded with the possibility that hungry bears might hover around human settlements, leading to the notion that the population is much larger than the actual population
 IUCN kaa dhruviya bhaaluu visheshgy samooh yah vichaar vyakt karata he ki "up-jansankhya ke aakaar ke anumaan yaa sasteneble harvest str ko vaigyanik adhyayanon ke samarthan ke bina puri tarah se paristhitiki ke paaramparik gyaan par aadhaarit nahin karnaa chahie
" Of the 19 recognized polar bear subpopulations, 8 are declining, 3 are stable, 1 is increasing, and 7 do not have enough data available
 dhruviya bhaaluu ko aksar ek samudri stanpayi mana jaataa he kyonki yah varsh ke kai maheene samudr par bitaata he
 Its favorite habitat is the annual sea ice covering the continental submerged ocean and the Arctic Inter-island Islands
 In these areas, known as the "arctic Life Circle", higher biological productivity is found, compared to the deep waters of the high Arctic
 dhruviya bhaaluu main aise kshetron kii ore lagaataar jane kaa jhukaav dekha jaataa he jahaan samudri barf pani se miltaa he, jaise polinya or leeds,, jahaan yah sil kaa shikaar karata he jo uskaa mukhya aahaar he
 Therefore, polar bears are mainly found in the periphery of the polar ice pack, rather than in the polar basin near the North Pole where the density of seals is low
 vaarshik barf main pani ke aise kshetra shaamil hai jo mausam parivartan ke saath varsh bhar prakat or gaayab hote rahete hai
 Seals have to migrate in response to these changes and polar bears are required to chase their prey

 In the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, polar bears return each summer to the north for snow, where snow accumulation occurs throughout the year

 The hollow guard hairs of a polar bear's coat were previously thought to act as fiber optic tubes for conducting light to their dark skin, where they could be absorbed; But this theory has been rejected by recent studies
 yah safed kot aam taur par umr ke saath pilaa ho jaataa he
 When the bear is kept in captivity in a moist, warm environment, the color of the fur may become light green due to the algae growing inside the guard hair

 The polar bear is the most carnivorous member of the bear family, and most of its diet consists of circular and bearded seals
 arctic main lakhon sil kaa awaas he jo us vakt shikaar ban jaati hai jab ve saans lene ke liye barf main chhed kii sataha par aati hai, yaa barf kii sataha par aaraam karne ke liye baahar aati hai
 Polar bears hunt primarily at the interface between snow, water, and wind; They rarely catch seals in open water or on land
 dhruviya bhaaluu kii sabase aam shikaar vidhi ko sthir-shikaar kaha jaataa he: sil ke saans lene ke chhed ko chihnit karne ke liye bhaaluu apni shandaar ghran shakti kaa upyog karata he or sarakate hue chuppi se paas jaakar sil ke dikhne kaa intazaar karata he
 When the seal exhales, the bear sniffs her breath, inserts its front claws into the hole and pulls it out onto the ice
 dhruviya bhaaluu, sil kii khopadi ko katkar or uske sir ko kuchal kar use maar detaa he
 The polar bear also hunts by chasing a seal that rests on the ice: after seeing a seal, it walks for 100 yards and then moves
 agar sil kaa dhyaan nahin jaataa he, to bhaaluu sil ke 30 se 40 feet nazadik tak jaataa he or phir achaanak hamalaa karne ke liye tezi se aage badhata he
 a third method of hunting is to attack the reproductive lair that the female seal makes in the snow
 ek vyapak dantakatha ke anusaar dhruviya bhaaluu, shikaar ke samay apni kaali naak ko apane panjon se dhak lete hai
 This behavior, if it occurs, is rare - although the story exists in native oral history and in the descriptions of early Arctic explorers, there is no record of eyewitness accounts of such behavior in recent decades

 The polar bear is a highly powerful predator
 vah ek vayask walrus ko maar saktaa he, haalanki vah shaayad hi kabhi aisa prayaas karata he kyonki ek walrus kaa vazan bhaaluu ke vazan se doguna ho saktaa he
 Polar bears also hunt beluga whales by attacking the breathing holes
 ye whale, walrus ke samaan aakaar kii hoti hai or unhen vash main karnaa bhaaluu ke liye utana hi mushkil hota he
 Most terrestrial animals in the Arctic can outrun the polar bear as the polar bear's body quickly heats up and most animals in the ocean can swim faster than the bear they encounter

 jab sharad ritu kii shuruyaat or garmi ke dauraan samudri barf anuplabdh rahati he, to kuch aabaadi, vasa bhandar par kai maheene nirbhar rahati he
 Polar bears have also been widely observed consuming a variety of other wild foods, including musk ox, reindeer, birds, eggs, rodents, shellfish, crabs, and other polar bears
 They can also eat plants, including berries, roots, and sea grasses, although none of these are an important part of their diet

 Unlike brown bears, polar bears are not territorial
 haalanki unki chhavi aakraamak bhukkad ke rup main bani hui he, ve saamaanya rup se muthbhed ke maamle main satark rahete hai or ladaai kii bajaay aksar batch kar nikal janaa pasand karte hai
 Bulky polar bears rarely attack humans unless they are severely provoked, while hungry polar bears are highly unpredictable and have been known to kill and occasionally eat humans

 Nevertheless, they have been seen frequently playing together and sleeping intermittently on a few occasions, and polar bear biologist Nikita Osiannikov says the adult male has a "well-developed friendship"
 " shaavak bhi vishesh rup se chanchal hote hai
 Fighting while playing, especially among young males, can be a way of practice for serious competition in life ahead during the season of intercourse

 Adult male bears sometimes kill and eat polar bear cubs, the reason for which is not yet clear
 alaska main, 42% shaavak 12 maheene kii umr tak pahunchate hai, jo 15 saal pehle ke 65% se kam he
 In most areas, lactation of cubs is stopped at the age of two and a half, when the mother chases them away or abandons them

 This was the case with 40% of the cubs in the early 1980s; By the 1990s, however, less than 20% were left at such a young age
 maa ke chale jane ke baad, shaavak bhai / bahan kabhi-kabhi hafton yaa maheenon saath-saath yatra karte hai or bhojan saajha karte hai
 In most areas the female is ready for breeding at the age of four but in the Beaufort Sea areas in five years
 Males typically achieve sexual maturity at six years, but as competition for females is fierce, many males are not able to mate until they are eight or ten years old

 Polar bears sometimes have to deal with various problems of skin diseases that can be caused by a mite or other parasite
 dhruviya bhaaluu shaayad hi kabhi 25 saal se zyada jinda rahete hai
 The oldest recorded wild bear death recorded at the age of 32, while the oldest imprisoned bear was a female who died in 1991 at the age of 43
 The oldest surviving polar bear, Debbie of the Assiniboine Park Zoo, was probably born in December 1966

 Polar bears rarely encounter wolves, although there are two recorded occasions when a herd of wolves killed polar bear cubs
 Polar bears are sometimes the holders of Arctic parasites such as Alaskozetes antarcticus
 dhruviya bhaaluon ne inuit, upic, chukchi, nenet, rusi pomor or anya sahit arctic logon ko lambe samay tak mahatvapurn kaccha maal pradaan kiya he
 Hunters commonly used a team of dogs to confuse bears, allowing them to spear the bear or shoot arrows at close quarters
 pakade gaye jaanavar ke lagbhag sabhi angon kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha
 Fur was used exclusively to sew trousers and was used by Nenet to make outer boots like rubber boots called toboks; Meat was edible despite the risk of trichinosis; Fat was used in foods and as a fuel in lighting for homes with seals and whale fat; Muscles were used to sew clothes; The gallbladder and sometimes the heart were dried and powdered for medicinal purposes; The large canine tooth had great importance as a talisman

 The increase of human population in the Eurasian Arctic in the 16th and 17th centuries, together with the invention and trade of firearms, dramatically increased polar bear hunting
 And since, polar bear fur has always played a marginal commercial role, figures on historical hunting are not solid
 udhaaharan ke liye, yah gyaat he ki 1784 / 1785 kii sardiyon main, pehle hi spitsburgen par roosi pomor ne magdalenefizorden main 150 dhruviya bhaaluu kaa shikaar kiya
