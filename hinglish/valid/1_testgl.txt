 If the attractive stimulus is able to activate a selective part of the brain, then the logic must be completely reversed, that is, selective activation of that part of the brain must produce a stimulus in order to be judged more positively
 It was performed with provocative scenes featuring medium attraction, and was later expanded and repeated to include negative stimuli

 However, there are still many questions that remain unanswered as to what is the better opposite definition of the approach in the prefrontal cortex, moving away, with no response, but strength and resistance or passive outcome without response
 Researches on shame and behavioral barriers have supported the action tendency model
 "homeostatic feelings" are the emotions generated by the internal state of the body, which organize our behavior

 kuch aise siddhant hai jo tark dete hai ki, sangyanatmak kriya - ek nirnay, moolyankan yaa vichaar - kisi bhaavana ko utpann karne ke liye aavashyak he
 According to Richard Laurus it is necessary to validate the fact that emotion arises about something or intentionally
 is prakaar kii sangyanatmak kriya chetan yaa avchetan ho sakati hai tathaa vaicharik prakriya kaa rup le sakati he yaa nahin le sakati he
 Here is an influential theory of Laurus: Emotion is an obstacle that arises in the following order: 1
) Cognitive appraisal — The person makes a rational assessment of the phenomenon that indicates emotion
 2
 shaareerik badlaav - sangyanatmak pratikriyaaon ke falswaroop jaivik badlaav hote hai, jaise, dil kii dhadkan kaa badhanaa yaa pituitary adrinil kii pratikriya
 3
 kriya - vyakti bhaavana ko anubhav karata he or pratikriya chunata he
 For example: Jenny sees a snake
 1
) jeni saanp ko dekhati he, jiske kaaran use dar lagata he 2
) uskaa dil jor se dhadkane lagata he
 Adrilene's blood flow is accelerated
 3
 jeni chillaati he or bhaag jaati he
 Laurus insists that the quality and intensity of emotions are controlled by cognitive responses
 ye pratikriyaayein bachaav ranneeti banaati hai jo vyakti or uske vaataavaran ke badlaav ke anusaar bhaavnaatmak pratikriya banati he
 Some theories related to emotions argue that cognitive action in the form of judgments, evaluations, or thoughts is necessary for emotion to occur

solomon hai 
 iskaa doosraa udhaaharan he, nico frijda dwaara prastaavit ek siddhant jiske anusaar moolyacan kii vajah se pravritiyaan ghatit hoti he
 It has also been suggested that emotions are commonly used as shortcuts for executing information and influencing behavior
 bhaawanaaon ke daihik or sangyanatmak siddhant kaa ek nayaa sankar siddhant avadharanatmak siddhant he
 This theory differs in the argument that bodily reactions are focused on emotions, however it emphasizes the significance of emotions or the idea that emotions are about something as found by cognitive theories
 is siddhant kaa nayaa daawa he ki is prakaar ke arth ke liye kalpana par aadhaarit sangyanaatmakataa anaavashyak he
 Rather, physical changes change themselves according to the meaningful content of emotions due to the change in the action due to some reason

 a sophisticated defense of this view was found in philosopher Jesse Prinz's book Gut Reactions and psychologist James Laird's book Feelings

vaais tathaa rasel kropangeno, ke dwaara viksit siddhant he, jo bhaavnaatmak anubhavon ke kaarnon, sanrachnaao or parinaamon par dhyaan detaa he

 Wise and Daniel J
 Beal in their articles Reflection on Affective Events Theory, which was published in 2005 on Research on Emotion in Published in Organizations

 This is based on the intentions of experiments which suggest that an injection of adrenalin may cause different emotional reactions of individuals despite being in the same mental state
 vyaktiyon kaa duusare vyakti kii sthiti ke anusaar vyakt kii gayi bhaavana ke anuroop gussa yaa prasannataa vyakt karte hue nirikshan kiya gaya
 Thus, the combination of status assessment and the participant taking adrenaline or placebo determined simultaneous responses
 This experiment has been criticized in Jesse Pinz's Gut Reactions

 " unhone yah bhi kaha ki gandhi koi amar vyakti nahin hai
 How many such people were born in India and went away
 ambedkar ne kaha ki gandhi kii jaan bachaane ke liye vah daliton ke hiton kaa tyaag nahin kar sakate
 Now Gandhi's health was continuously deteriorating due to the death fast

 He proposed that the provincial boundaries of Punjab and Bengal should be redrawn to separate Muslim and non-muslim majority parts

 He referred to historical events such as the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire and Czechoslovakia in favor of his view of the communal divide between Hindus and Muslims
 unhone poocha ki kya pakistan kii sthapana ke liye paryaapt kaaran maujuud the? or suzav diya ki hindu or musalamaanon ke bich ke matbhed ek kam kathor kadam se bhi mitaanaa sambhav ho saktaa tha
 He has written that Pakistan should justify its existence
 canada jaise deshon me bhi sampradayik mudde hameshaa se rahe hai par aaj bhi angrej or francisi ek saath rahete hai, to kya hindu or musalmaan bhi saath nahin rah sakate
 He warned that the actual implementation of the solution to create two countries would be extremely difficult
