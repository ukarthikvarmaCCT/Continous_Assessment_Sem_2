 in the case that when power goes out they interfere with the power received by the concerned equipment for a negligible time, so that the work of that device is not interrupted or hindered
 upies kaa upyog computaron, aankada kendra, sanchaar upkarnon, aadi ke saath praaia: kiya jaataa he jahaan ki vidyut jane se koi durghatana ho sakati he; mahatvapurn aankade nasht hone kaa dar ho; vyapaar kaa nuksaan aadi ho saktaa ho
 UPS not only protects the computer from loss in case of over-voltage, but also provides power to the computer for some time after the power supply is gone, allowing users to save their work and keep the computer correct
 Ways to shut down
 yadi computer kii vidyut aapurti ekadam se chali jaae yaa asthir ho jaye to isse hard drive or ram kharaab hone kii sambhaavna rahati he tathaa madraboard bhi khatre main pad saktaa he
 UPS must also have voltage control, so that UPS can protect the computer from this danger
 ye dhyaan rakhana chaiye ki upies ko bahari upkarnon se overlod na karen jaise anaavashyak printer, scinar or fax mashin aadi lagaana
 Never plug the printer into the battery back up system
 isi prakaar upies yaa to ofline prakaar kaa ho saktaa he yaa line-interactive prakaar kaa ho saktaa he
 Offline UPS puts all the load on the battery
 swissover karne kaa rispance time, jise swimming time bhi kehete hai, 2 se 10 minute hota he
 Most switching-mode power supplies have a hold-up time of less than 16 minutes, which is higher than the ups's switching time, which will not cause computer shutdown
 vartmaan main milane vaale adhiktar upies line interective upies hote hai
 They control the input AC power to a limit and the battery is charged with AC power
 itnaa hi nahin, is tarah ke upies chote aakaar ke hote hai or adhiktar utpaadakon ke paas uplabdh hote hai
 Online UPS UPS are comparatively expensive
 is dizin main bydaree inwarter ke dwaara charge hoti he
 Since there is no direct connection to the AC line, it does not affect UPS in the line
 yadi ghar main computer prayog karte hai to iske liye tulanaatmak rup se saste standbai power system kaa prayog karnaa chaiye
 There are many types of UPS
 ek vargeekaran ke anusaar ye sthitik ho sakate hai yaa ghurni 
 UPS in which no rotating machine is used but only real semiconductor devices are called static UPS
 iske vipareet jinamein rotary mashiinon kaa upyog hota he unhen rotary upies kehete hai
 Were upies kii shakti kshamta adhik honi chaiye
 More upss are designed such that the devices connected to them can work up to 10 minutes after the power goes out
 iske liye ve
e
 reating dhyaan rakhni hoti he
 Ampere rating is written on computer / equipment, which can be multiplied by voltage
 aisa upies lenaa chaiye, jisaki ve
e
 reating 20 se 25 pratishat zyada ho
 a 600 volt-ampere rate UPS is enough for most pcs
 zyaadaatar upies byaap time ke aadhaar par liya jaataa he jisase uski puri kshamta kaa gyaan nahin ho paata he
 Battery backup depends entirely on how much energy the connecting device is consuming
 upkaran jitna shaktishaalee hoga, urja kii khapat utani zyada karegaa

 This concept is usually related to computer or information systems
 software ejineering main SDLC avadharana kai prakaar ke software deveopment kaary pranaaliyon ko sahaayta pahunchaati hai
 These systems create the framework for planning and controlling the creation of information systems: software development process

 Any SDLC must be the result of high quality systems that meet or exceed customer expectations, which are completed within time and estimated cost, effectively and smoothly in current and planned information technology infrastructure Works and maintains it are cheap and cost-effective to increase
 computer system bahut jatil ho gaya he or aksar bahu paaramparik system link kii aapurti vibhinn software vikritaon dwaara hoti hai
 To manage this level of complexity, several SDLC models have been created: "waterfall", "fountain", "spiral", "build and Fix", "rapid Phototyping", "incremental" and "synchronize and Stabilize"
 SDLC model ko kushal spectrum ke saath, paraspar prabhavi or parinami paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa hai
 Efficient functionalities such as XP and Scrum focus on underweight processes that allow for rapid changes along the development cycle

 Information systems activities revolve around heavy data processing and number crunching routines
 1980 ke dashak main strecchard systams analysis or dijin methd SDLC main aadhaarit tha
 a systems approach to the analysis and design of SSADM information systems, a UK Government office built for the Government Commercial Office, is associated with the use of technology in government

 System development life cycles follow important steps that are required of the developer such as planning, analysis, design and implementation and are explained in the section below
 kai systams vikaas jivan chakra astitv main hai
 The oldest model, originally thought to be "the systems development life cycle", is the waterfall model, a sequence of steps in which the output of each phase proceeds to the next stage
 ye charan saamanytah usee aadharbhoot kadamon kaa anusaran karti hai lekin kai vibhinn waterfol kaary pranaliyaan qadamon ko alag naam detii hai or kadamon kii sankhya main 4 or 7 ke bich kaa antar hota he
 No system development life cycle model is perfect, but the steps can be quality and divided into different stages
 bhavi pariyojna kaa ucch stareey rup utpann karne or pariyojna kaa lakshya nirdhaarit karne ke liye
 Feasibility studies are sometimes used to present a project to higher management in an effort to obtain funding
 pariyojnaon ko aamtaur par vyavhaaryata ke teen kshetron main moolyankit kiya jaataa he: arth sambandhi, kaary sambandhi or takanic sambandhi
 iske alaava, iskaa prayog prayojna ko patari par rakhane ke sandarbh main or MIS team kii pragati kaa moolyankan karne main bhi hota he
 MIS also complements those steps
 is charan ko vishleshan charan bhi kaha jaataa he
 The purpose of system analysis is to decide where the problem lies in attempting to fix the system
 is charan main system ko vibhinn hisson main todna or sthiti ke vishleshan ke liye aarekh kheenchna shaamil hai
 The purpose of the project is to analyze the segmented tasks that need to be built and to keep the user involved so that definite requirements can be defined
 aavashyak gadering ko kabhi-kabhi vistrut or sahi jaruraton ko praapt karne ke liye graahak ke saath-saath seva pradaataaon ke vyaktigat / team kii zarurat padati he
 The system design describes functions and operations in detail, including table layouts, business rules, process diagrams, and other documentation
 is charan kaa nirgaman naye system ko maapdand ke rup main yaa upsystem ke rup main varnan karegaa
 In the design phase, requirements are taken as their initial input
 in aavashyaktaaon kii pahchaan sweekrut aavashyak dastauez main ho jaati he
 For each requirement, a set of one or more design components will be offered as a result of interviews, workshops and / or ideal efforts
 The design component describes the desired software features in detail and is usually included with functional hierarchy diagrams, table layout diagrams, business rules tables, business process diagrams, ciudocodes, and a complete nostalgic complete data dictionary
 in dijin avyavon ko paryaapt vistaar ke saath software kaa varnan karne ke liye nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he jisamen kushal programmers nunetan atirikt nivesh ke saath software deveopment kar sake
 Modular and subsystems programming code is completed during this phase
 ikai pareekshan or mapank pareekshan is str main developaron ke dwaara kii jaati hai
 This phase is integrated with the next phase in which individual modules will need to be tested before integration of the main project
 software pareekshan main code kaa vibhinn staron par pareekshan hota he
 Unit, system and user acceptance tests are performed multiple times
 yah ek grey aria he kyonki isamen kai vichaar astitv main he ki agar koi punrariti ghatit ho jaae to pareekshan ke charan kya ho or kitni ho
 Recurrence is usually not part of the waterfall model but some occur at this stage
 system ke failaav main vriddhiyon yaa system ke samaapan se pehle parivartan or seva mukt karnaa sammilit he
 Maintenance of the system is an important aspect of SDLC as new changes will be implemented in the organization as the main employee change places; Which will require system modern reasons
 system deveopment life saaikal charan pariyojna gatividhi ke liye programatic guide ke rup main kaam karti he or pariyojna ke vishay se kaam karti he or pariyojna ke vishay se gahare milan karke pariyojnaon ko chalaane kaa lacheela lekin anukool rasta pradaan karti he
 Each of the objectives of the SDLC phase is defined in this department with a summary of the key accomplishments, an explanation of the tasks assigned, and the associated controlled objectives for effective management
 pariyojnaayen karyanvit karne ke saath har SDLC charan ke dauraan niyantran uddeshyon kaa nirmaan or sanchaalan karnaa pariyojna prabandhak ke liye bahut sankatpurna he
 The control objective helps provide a clear statement of the desired or proposed outcome and should be used within the entire SDLC process
 control objactives ko mukhya virgon main samoohikrut kiya ja saktaa he or jaisaa ki chitra main darshaya gaya he, yah SDLC charnon se judaa hua he
 The management and control of any initial SDLC will require every project to list and hold some of the tasks required to build some degree of work constraint structure
 WBS or sabhi programatic saamagree pariyojna notebook ke "project diskripshan" vibhaag main rakhaa janaa chahie
 The WBS format is mostly assigned to the project manager who sets it up in such a way that the project work is best interpreted
 kuch mukhya kshetra hai jo WBS main SDLC niti ke ansh ke rup main zarur varnit kiye jaae
 nimnlikhit aarekh mukhya kshetron kaa varnan karata he jo pariyojna prabandhak dwaara nirmit tareeke main WBS main vyavyachit kii jaayegi
 The work department should identify the main phases and project milestones in a concise manner
 iske atirikt, upari vibhaag ko sampurna vishay kaa avlokan or pariyojna kii samay seemaa pradaan kerani chahie or pariyojna anumodan ke liye aarambhik pariyojna vivaran prayaas kaa bhaag hoga
 The Central Department of WBS is based on seven system development life cycles as a guide to the WBS work development
 WBS tatv milstons se bana hona chahie or "kriyalap" ke virodh main "kaary" or ek nishchit avadhi rahani chahie

 Dardi or Dardic languages are a subdivision of indo-aryan languages, whose most well-known language is Kashmiri
 dardi bhashaayen uttari pakistan, uttar-purvi afghanistan or bharat ke jammu-kashmir rajya main boli jaatin hai
 Among all the Dardi languages, the status of Kashmiri is the highest because it has its own popular literature and also has the honor of being an official language of India
 pakistan ke chitral zile kii khovaar bhashaa, uttari kashmir main boli jane vaali shina bhashaa or afghanistan ke purvi nuristaan, nangarhaar or kunar rajyon main boli jane vaali pashai bhashaa anya mashhoor dardi bhashaayen hai
 There are no two opinions that Sanskrit, Persian, Punjabi, hindi-urdu etc
 have influence on almost all Dardi languages and many of their words are used in Dardi languages
 lekin bahut bhashavaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ke dardi bhashaaon ne bhi gair-dardi hindi-arya bhashaaon par apni chhap chodi he
 It is believed that some dialects of Punjabi, Uttarakhand and some other languages have an influence on Dardi
 haalanki is par vivaad jari he, lekin ek dharna yah bhi he ki pracheen kaal main dardi ek bahut bade kshetra main boli jaati thi jo sindhu nadi ke ird-gird or phir himachal or uttarakhand main failaa hua tha
 There are some special things in Dardi languages that make their identity in the entire indo-aryan language family, such that mahapraan consonants are pronounced like hypnotic consonants
 zyaadaatar hid-arya bhashaaon main mahapraan vyanjanon ko vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjan 'kha' ko munh se vaayu-pravaah se bolaa jaataa he jabaki uske milte hue alpapraan vyanjan 'k' ko bahut kam vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he
 This is not the case in Dardic languages
 in bhashaaon main vaayu-pravaah kii bajaay sur badal ke alpapraan or mahapraan vyanjanon main antar kiya jaataa he
 For example, where the word 'bhoomi' is in Sanskrit, there is 'buum' in the Khovar language, in which the voice goes from thick voice to thin tone
 isi tarah se jahaan hindi main mahapraani 'dha' se 'dhuaan' hota he vahaan pashai main alpapraani 'da' se 'duum' hota he
 In Kashmiri there is 'dod' instead of 'milk' in Sanskrit and 'milk' in Hindi
 pashchimi pahari ore punjabi main bhi isi tarah mahapraan ke sthaan par swar-badlaav dekhne ko miltaa he, jaise kii punjabi main hindi ke 'ghar' kii jagah swar badalata hua shabd 'kar' hota he
 Dardi languages often have syllable shifting, in which a vowel around the letter 'r' of the same word changes its place
 yah dardi bhashaaon main prachinkaal se hota aa rahaa he or gandhar kshetra main samraat ashok ke jamaane kii shilaon main bhi yah dekha ja saktaa he, jo 269 ipu se 231 ipu main khadi kii gai thim
 One title of Emperor Ashoka was 'priyadarshi' - but 'priyadrashi' is often seen on these rocks because of the syllable shifting, 'drisha' of 'darsha' became
 isi tarah in shilaon par 'dharm' ke sthaan par 'dhram' miltaa he
 In modern times, the word 'long' in Sanskrit can be seen in the word 'drig' in Kalash languages
 palula bhashaa main sanskrit kaa 'durbal' badal kar 'druble' ban jaataa he or sanskrit kaa 'bhurj' badal kar 'barhuj' ban jaataa he
 The ‘poor’ of Sanskrit becomes ‘drolid’ of Kashmiri and ‘karma’ becomes ‘kram’ in Kashmiri
 dardi bhashaaon kii yah pravriti punjabi or pashchimi pahari bhashaaon main bhi kuch had tak dekhi ja sakati he
 In Persian, where the tree is called 'dukht', in Punjabi it becomes 'drakht'
 adhiktar hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he
 But in Dardic languages, verb words come in the middle of a sentence
 is maamle main dardi bhashaayen angrezi kii tarah hotin hai
 In the sentences written above, the verb is written in thick letters
 jaisaa kii spasht he, lagbhag sari hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he, lekin dardik is niyam ko bhang karti he or angrezi kii tarah kriya ko sangya ke baad daalati he
 Such languages that are inserted after the verb noun are called "verb second languages"
 avar treez still gro in dehara angrezi bhashaa ke vikhyath sahityakar ruskin bond dwaara rachit ek kahani–sangrah he jiske liye unhen san 1992 main angrezi bhashaa ke liye sahitya academy puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya

 The Genome Project is a scientific project that aims to find out the entire genome sequence of a creature
 jin hamaare jivan kii kunjee he
 We look or do the same way, which fixes the microscopic genes hidden in our body to a large extent
 yahi nahin, jin maanav itihaas or bhavishya kii ore bhi sanket karte hai
 Gene scientists believe that once the structure of all the genes of mankind is detected, then it will be possible to predict all biological events and somatic symptoms of life on the basis of the gene-horoscope of man
 yadhyapi yah koi aasaan kaam nahin he, kyonki maanav sharir main hajaaron lakhon jivit koshiken hotin hai
 This huge group of genes is called a genome
 aaj se lagbhag 136 varsh purv, bohemian bhikshuk grager jon mendal ne matar ke daanon par kiye apane prayogon ko prakashit kiya tha, jisamen anuvaanshiki ke adhyayan kaa ek nayaa yug aarambh hua tha
 From these articles onwards the rules of genetics were made
 unhone isamen ek nayi anuvaanshikeey ikai kaa naam jin rakhaa, tathaa iske pruthak hone ke niyamon kaa gathan kiya
 Thomas Hunt Morgan, doing research on Drosophila in 1910, proved that genes reside in the chromosome, in a straight line, and which genes are in which place on the chromosome can also be detected
 harman mular ne 1926 main khoj kii, ki drosophila ke jin main eksre se anuvaanshikeey parivartan ho jaataa he, jise utparivartan bhi kehete hai
 In 1944, it was proved that DNA is not a protein but a DNA
 san 1953 main watson or crik ne di en e kii sanrachana kaa pataa lagaaya or batya, ki yah do tantuon se bana hua ghumaavdaar seedhinuma, yaa dohari kundalini ke aakaar kaa hota he
 The entire genome of any animal is called a genome
 maanav sharir hajaaron-lakhon jivit koshikaon kaa bana hua he, jinhen ham koshikaon ke naam se jaanate hai
 Each cell is so subtle that we cannot see it only with our eyes
 use dekhne ke liye sookshmdarshi kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 There is a nucleus inside each cell
 prayek kendrak ke andar dhaage ke aakaar kii sanrachanaayen hoti hai, jinhen gunasutra kehete hai
 Each nucleus has 46 chromosomes
 23 gunsutra pita se va 23 mata se aate hai
 These chromosomes are made up of proteins and nucleic acids
 jise di en e kehete hai
 The structural unit of a nucleic acid is a nucleotide
 jab ek koshika kaa vibhaajan hokar do koshikaayen banatin hai, tab unka jinom bhi duguna ho jaataa he
 At the time of cell division, both strands of DNA are isolated and a new complement of each fiber is formed by the rule of nucleotide pairing or base pairing
 atah prayek nayi koshika ke di en e main ek nayaa or ek purana tantu hota he
 The new filament that is formed by following the rule of base pairing is an exact copy of the old filament
 di en e chaar mul beson kaa bana hota he: The a of one fiber connects with the t of the other fiber, and the c of one fiber connects with the g of the other fiber
 ek di en e kaa tantu duusare kaa sampoorak hota he
 Therefore, if the sequence of one fiber is known, the other can be found
 in do tantuon ke bich hydrogen bandha hote hai, jo do beson ko jodate hai
 The specific sequence of different base pairs of DNA is called a gene
 vastutah jin hi anuvaanshikta kii bhautik va kayik ikai he
 This encodes information that directs protin synthesis
 aisa anumaan he, ki lagbhag ek se ded tak jin prayek koshika main hai, jo hamaare sharir ke sabhi kaaryon ko sampann karne main sakasham hai
 But such genes are only about three percent in the cell
