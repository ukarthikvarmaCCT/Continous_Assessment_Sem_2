 colector ne nawabrai ko hidaayat di ki ab ve kuch bhi nahin likhenge, yadi likhaa to jail bhej diya jayega
 By this time Premchand used to write under the name Dhanpat Rai

 This was followed by Premchand's first story collection called soze-watan which was published in 1908
 soje-vatan yani desh kaa dard
 Fueled by patriotism, it was banned by the English government and warned its author not to do such writing in future
 iske kaaran unhen naam badalakar likhnaa padaa
 His first story titled 'premchand' was published in the December 1910 issue of Bada Ghar Ki Beti Zamana magazine
 maranoparant unki kahaniyaan maansarovar naam se 8 khandon main prakashit hui
 The story said that Emperor Premchand said that the litterateur is not the truth behind patriotism and politics, but rather the truth which shows the torch before him
 yah baat unke sahitya main ujagar hui he
 In 1921, he quit his job at the call of Mahatma Gandhi
 kuch maheene maryaada patrika kaa sampadan bhaar sambhala, chah saal tak maadhuri naamak patrika kaa sampadan kiya, 1930 main banaras se apana masik patr hans shuru kiya or 1932 ke aarambh main jaagran naamak ek saptahik or nikaala

 Premchand wrote a total of nearly three hundred stories, about a dozen novels and many articles
 unhone kuch naatak bhi likhe or kuch anuwaad kaary bhi kiya
 Many literary works of Premchand were translated into many languages including English, Russian, German
 godaan unki kaaljayi rachana he
 Kafan is believed to be his final story
 unhone hindi or urdu main puure adhikaar se likhaa
 Most of his compositions originally written in Urdu, but they went first publication was in Hindi
 taintis varshon ke rachanaatmak jivan main ve sahitya kii aisi viraasat saunp gaye jo gunon kii drushti se amuly he or aakaar kii drushti se aseemit
 Premchand's composition and vision came in various literary forms
 bahumukhi pratibha sampann premchand ne upanyaas, kahani, naatak, samiksha, lekh, sampadakeey, sansmaran aadi anek vidhaon main sahitya kii sristi kii
 He was prominently known as a storyteller and during his lifetime he was awarded the title of 'novel Emperor'

 This situation appears equally in both Hindi and Urdu languages
 premchand ke upanyaas na keval hindi upanyaas sahitya main balki sampurna bhartiya sahitya main mile ke pathar hai
 Premchand first begins his novelist in fiction
 unka pehla urdu upanyaas ‘asaraare maaabid urf devsthan rahasy’ urdu saptahik ‘'aawaaj-e-khalq'’ main 8 oktober, 1903 se 1 farvari, 1905 tak dharawahik rup main prakashit hua
 His second novel 'hamkhurma aur Humswab', a Hindi adaptation of which was published in 1907 under the name 'prema'
 chunki premchand mul rup se urdu ke lekhak the or urdu se hindi main aae the, isliye unke sabhi aarambhik upanyaas mul rup se urdu main likhe gaye or baad main unka hindi tarjuma kiya gaya
 He entered the world of Hindi novel from the novel 'sevasadan'
 yah mul rup se unhone 'bajaare-husn' naam se pehle urdu main likhaa lekin iskaa hindi rup 'sevasadan' pehle prakashit karaayaa
 'sevasadan' is the story of a woman becoming a prostitute
 dow ramvilas sharma ke anusaar 'sevasadan' main vyakt mukhya samasya bhartiya nari kii paradheenata he
 After this came his first novel 'premashram' on peasant life
 iskaa masauda bhi pehle urdu main 'goshaae-aafiyat' naam se taiyaar hua tha lekin 'sevasadan' kii bhaanti ise pehle hindi main prakashit karaayaa
 'premashram' is probably the first novel in Hindi written on peasant life

 After this, the journey through 'rangbhoomi', 'rejuvenation', 'nirmala', 'drone', 'karmabhoomi' was completed to 'godan'

 Creating a common peasant hero of the novel was like to change the course of the novel tradition
 samantvaad or poonjeevaad ke chakra main funskar hui kathanayake hori kii mrityu pathakon ke jahan ko jhakzor kar rakh jaati he
 In his previous novels 'premashram' and 'karmabhoomi' on peasant life, while presenting the Premchand reality, he embraces the ideal till the end of the novel
 lekin godaan kaa kaarunik ant is baat kaa gavaah he ki tab tak premchand kaa adarshavaad se mohabhang ho chukaa tha
 This can also be seen in his last period stories
 'mangalsutra' premchand kaa adhuraa upanyaas he
 The original story of Premchand's novels was Indian rural life
 premchand ne hindi upanyaas ko jo oonchaai pradaan kii, vah parvarti upanyaaskaaron ke liye ek chunauti bani rahi

 Popular stories of Premchand ji premchand ne 'sangram', 'karbala' or 'prem kii vedi' naatakon kii rachana kii
 These plays are good at the level of craftsmanship and compassion, but their stories and novels have attained such a height that Premchand did not get much success in the field of drama
 ye naatak vastutah sanvadatmak upanyaas hi ban gaye hai
 Premchand was not only a sensitive storyteller, but also a vigilant citizen and editor
 unhone 'hans', 'maadhuri', 'jaagran' aadi patr-patrikaon kaa sampadan karte hue va tatkaaleen anya sahagaami saahitiyik patrikaon 'chaand', 'maryaada', 'swadesh' aadi main apni saahitiyik va saamaajik chintaaon ko lekhon yaa nibandhon ke madhyam se abhivyakt kiya

 The Hindi translation of 'fasan-e-azad', the Urdu novel of Ratannath Sarshar, by him, 'azad Katha' became very famous
 premachand urdu kaa sanskaar lekar hindi main aae the or hindi ke mahaan lekhak bane

 He established a strong urge for timeliness in literature
 aam aadmi ko unhone apni rachanaaon kaa vishay banaaya or uski samasyaon par khulkar kalam chalaate hue unhen sahitya ke nayakon ke pad par asin kiya
 Before Premchand, Hindi literature was entangled in the stories of the king-queen, the thrill
 premchand ne sahitya ko sachai ke dharaatal par utaara
 He brought out the truth of life and time
 ve sampradayikta, bhrashtachar, jameendaari, karjakhori, garibi, upniveshwaad par aaajeevan likhte rahe
 Most of Premchand's compositions tell the story of his poverty and poverty

 unhone saral, sahaj or aam bol-chaal kii bhashaa kaa upyog kiya or apane pragatisheel vichaaron ko dridhtaa se tark dete hue samaaj ke saamne prastut kiya

 premchand hindi sahitya ke yug pravartak hai
 He started a new tradition of idealistic realism in Hindi story
 itane mahaan rachanaakaar hone ke baavjood premchand kaa jivan aaropon se mukt nahin he
 Kamalkishore Goenka, a scholar of Premchand, in his book 'premchand: New Directions of Study', tried to reduce the importance of his literature by making some allegations on Premchand's life
 premchand par lage mukhya aarope hai- premchand ne apni pehali patni ko bina vajah choda or duusare vivaah ke baad bhi unke anya kisi mahila se sambandh rahe, premchand ne 'jaagran vivaad' main vinodashankar vyas ke saath dhokhaa kiya, premchand ne apni press ke varisht karmchaaree pravasilal verma ke saath dhokhaadhadi kii, premchand kii press main mazdooron ne hadtaal kii, premchand ne apni beti ke biimaar hone par jhaad-phoonk kaa sahaara liya aadi
 These allegations made by Kamalkishore Goenka do bring to us a side of Premchand's life, which reveals his human weaknesses but the evaluation of his extensive literature has no effect on these allegations
 prem chandra ko log aaj unki kaabiliyat kii vajah se yaad karte hai jo vivaadon ko bahut kam jagah detii he
 Premchand is often known as "munshi Premchand"
 premchand ke naam ke saath 'munshi' kab or kaise jud gaya? is vishay main adhikansh log yahi maan lete hai ki prarambh main premchand adhyaaapak rahe
 The teachers were often called Munshi ji at that time
 iske atirikt kaaysthon ke naam ke pehle sammaan swaroop 'munshi' shabd lagane kii parampara rahi he
 Probably, the word Munshi became rigid with the name of Premchand ji
 professor shukdev singh ke anusaar premchand ji ne apane naam ke aage 'munshi' shabd kaa prayog swayan kabhi nahin kiya
 He also believes that the word Munshi is a sign of respect, which fans of Premchand may have once imposed
 yah tathy anumaan par aadhaarit he
 But the authentic reason for adding the Munshi adjective to Premchand's name is that the letter 'hans' used to co-edit Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 jisaki kuch pratiyon par kanhaiyalaal munshi kaa puraa naam na chhapakar maatr 'munshi' chapa rahata tha saath hi premchand kaa naam is prakaar chapa hota tha- 
 Editor Munshi, premchand'hans' editors were Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 parantu kalantar main pathakon ne 'munshi' tathaa 'premchand' ko ek samaj liya or 'premchand'- 'munshi premchand' ban gaye
 It's but natural
 saamaanya pathak praaia: lekhak kii kritiyon ko padhata he, naam kii sookshmata ko nahin dekha karata
 Today, Premchand's ornamentation of Premchand has become so orthodox that it is only by 'munshi' that Premchand's realization is made and by not saying 'munshi', Premchand's name seems incomplete

 He began to portray all the problems of society at that time

 All these subjects later became major discourses of Hindi literature

1750 ko hui| In the chapter "ishwari Singh" of Sir Yadunath Sarkar's 'history of Jaipur' it is described that after the death of Maharaja Sawai Jaisingh in 1743, his eldest son Ishwari Singh took over the reign, which was also recognized by the King of Delhi, Muhammad Shah
 
 vah sthaneey saradaaron kii sahmati se mewar kii rani se janma betaa hi jaipur ke raaj-asana par baithegaa|| mewar kii rani se janma betaa madhosingh tha
 But when Ishwar Singh announced to be the ruler of Jaipur before his intentions were completed, the enraged Madhosingh, together with his maternal uncle, Maharana of Udaipur and the kings of Bunda and Bundi, attacked Jaipur in 1744

 " ek baar phir bhilwara ke kasbe jahajpur ke paas donon bhaaiyon main yuddh hua or march 1747 main ishwari singh kii hi jeet hui
 a year later, in May 1748, the Peshwas of Madhosinh's supporters pressured Ishwari Singh to hand over four / five parganas to Madhosinh
 inkaar kiye jane par san 1748 main madhosingh ne udaipur ke maharana, malharav holkar va kota, bundi, jodhpur or shahpura ke nareshon ke saath mil kar phir jaipur par hamalaa bolaa
 Maharaja Surajmal also reached Jaipur with the help of Ishwari Singh with ten thousand soldiers and in August 1748, Jaipur was again conquered in the battle under the leadership of General Hargovind Natani at Bagru, 20 miles from Jaipur
 " Ishwari Singh had great faith in his other minister Keshavdas Khatri, but he did not like Hargovind Natani with a teary eye
 keshavadas khatri kaa chunki maraathon main bhi sammaan tha or malhaar raav holkar bhi uski baat mana karata tha, rajmahal ke yuddh ke baad hargovind nataani ne raja ko bahakaaya ki keshavadas khatri bheetar se maraathon se mila hua he or jaipur par hamale 'usee kii shah par' hote aa rahe hai, ishwarisingh ne nataani kii is baat par bina pushti yakeen karte hue ek din keshavadas khatri ko vish dilava kar marava daalaa
 After Keshav Das, Hargovind Natani was to be given the post of 'chief Minister', he got it

 Since this tower was built by Maharaja Ishwari Singh, it was named 'isarlat'; But it seems to be more popularly known as 'sargasuli' in the local language due to its seeming 'a tower touching the heavens'

After some time, it is said - when Holkar took the army to Moti Dungri and put it to a halt for the purpose of the invasion, the commander Natani once again falsely convinced the king not to worry at all - "fight the Marathas One lakh Kachwaha soldiers are in my pocket "but after some time he suddenly said to Ishwar Singh -" Kai karun annadata, maharo to khinso hi phatgyo " or ye ahsaas hone par ki ye durbhagyapurna din nikat darbariyon kii maraathon se mili-bhagat se dekhnaa pad rahaa he, ishwarisingh ne "pus dwadashi vikram samvath 1807 ko apni teen pradhan raniyon or ek khaas sevika sahit sarpdansh or vishpan se madhyaraatri main aatmahatya kar lee

 maarg main us shikari pakshi ko ek duusari shikari pakshi mil gaya
 There was war between the two birds

 In the Yamuna, there lived a nymph made of fish due to the curse of Brahma

 On completion of the pregnancy, a Nishad trapped the fish in his net

 We do not have sex

 " is par maharaj prateep bole, "gange! tum meri dahini jaangh par baithi ho
 The wife should be vamangi, right thigh is the symbol of the son, so i accept you as my daughter-in-law
 " yah sun kar ganga vahaan se chali gayi
 Now Maharaja Pratip started doing intense penance to get a son
 unke tap ke falswaroop unhen putr kii prapti hui jiskaa naam unhone shantanu rakhaa
 When Shantanu was young, Maharaja Pratipa went to heaven, ordering him to marry Ganga
 pita ke aadesh kaa paalan karne ke liye shantanu ne ganga ke paas jaakar unase vivaah karne ke liye nivedan kiya
 Ganga said, "rajan! i can marry you, but you have to promise that you will not interfere in any of my work
" " shantanu ne ganga ke kahe anusaar vachan de kar unase vivaah kar liya
 Maharaj Shantanu had eight sons from the Ganga's womb, out of which seven were taken away by Ganga into the Ganges river and due to his promise, Maharaj Shantanu could not speak anything
 jab ganga kaa aathvaan putr hua or vah use bhi nadi main bahaane ke liye le jane lagi to raja shantanu se rahaa na gaya or ve bole, "gange! tumne mere saat putron ko nadi main baha diya kintu apni pratigya ke anusaar maine kuch na kaha
 Now you are going to shed this eighth son of mine too
 main tumse prarthana karata hoon ki krupa karke ise nadi main mat bahaao
 On hearing this, Ganga said, "rajan! You have broken your vow so i can no longer be with you
 " itnaa kah kar ganga apane putr ke saath antardhyaan ho gayi
