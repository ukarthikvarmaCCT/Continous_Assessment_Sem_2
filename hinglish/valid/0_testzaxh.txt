 sabad yaa shabd kaa prayog hindi ke sant-sahitya main bahulata se hua he
 Baratwal has written on the basis of Garibdas that "the word is used as Guru's teaching, Sign, Patola, Kuchi, Baan, Musk, Nirbhayavani, Anhad Vani, Shabdbrahma and Paramatma"
 "sabad" yaa "shabd" praaia: gey hote hai
 Therefore, in raga raginis, we have been saying "sabad" or words on the bandha
 sidhon se lekar nirguni, saguni sabhi sampradaay ke sant athwa bhakton ne vividh raag raaginiyon main padrachana kii he
 But not every lyrical term is called sabd
 santon kii anubhuti "sabad" kehalaati he
 "sabad" has been used a lot in Kabir's compositions and in different ways
 hajariprasad dvivedi ne apane "hindi sahitya kaa adikaal" sheershak granth main likhaa he, sanwat 1715 kii likhi hui ek prati se sangruhit or gorakhbani main uddhrut padon ko "sabdi" kaha gaya he
 Kabir may have assumed "sabad" from there
 " The widespread influence of the Naths was not limited only to their views or ideas, their diverse forms of expression have also influenced their later Hindi saints
 sant to praaia: janata main prachlit bhavaprakash kii style ko or bhashaaroop ko apanaaya karte hai jisase unke vichaar sheeghra hi usamen sancharit ho sakennathon ne sidhon se or vibhinn sampradaayon santon ne naathon se yadi "sabad" yaa pad style grahan kii to yah swaabhaavik hi tha
 "sakhi" and "sabad" of Nirguni saints became highly prevalent
 kai baar ye donon shabd ek duusare ke paryaayavachi banakar bhi vyavahrut hote rahe
 Barathwal is of the opinion that "from the point of view, some difference between these two is often targeted
 "sabad" kaa prayog bhitari tathaa anubhav ahlad ke vyaktikaran ke liye kiya jaataa he or saakhi kaa prayog dainik jivan main lakshith honevaale vyaavhaarik anubhav ko spasht karne main hua karata he
 "this means that" Sabad "is self-realization and Sakhi Bahnubhuti
 parantu sant vaanmay ke anushilan se "saakhi" or "sabad" kaa yah bhed sadaa parilakshith nahin hota
 Barthwal himself also admitted at one point that "sometimes one of these is seen to be in place of the other
 "sabad ke sambandh main ek baat nishchit he ki unhen raag raaginiyon main kehane kii puraani paripati rahi he
 From this, instead of dividing according to the "sabad" themes of Kabri, ragas are found more divided according to Raginis

 Someone once asked you how Hindus became such a large number of Muslims
 apane saat kaaran bataaye
 1
 Accidentally made a Muslim in a Muslim invasion 2
 musalamaani raaj main jar, joru va jameen dekar kai pratishthit hinduo ko muslmaan banaaya gaya 3
 Due to the degradation of Urdu, Persian education and Sanskrit in Islamic period
 4
 hinduon main punarvivaah na hone ke kaaran va sati pratha par roak lagane ke baad hindu aurato ne muslmaan ke ghar kii shobhaa badhai tathaa agar kisi hindu yuvak kaa muslmaan stri se sambandh hua to use jati se nikal kar muslmaan bana diya gaya
 5
 Many Hindus became heretics due to the practice of idolatry 6
 musalamaani veshyyo ne kai hinduon ko fansaa kar muslmaan bana diya 7
 Muslims became Muslims due to non-promotion of Vedic religion
 agar gaharaai se sochaa jaye to pandit ji ne hinduon ko jati raksha ke liye upaay bataa die hai, agar ab bhi nahin sudhare to hindu kab sudharege
 During Panditji's time, a new religion of Islam grew in Kadian, District Gurudaspur Punjab, which was founded by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad
 islam ke maanane vaale mohammad sahib ko aakhri paigambar maanate hai, mirza ne apane aapako kabhi krishna, kabhi nanak, kabhi isa messiah kabhi islam kaa aakhri paigambar ghoshit kar diya tathaa apane naveen mat ko chalane ke liye nai nai bhavishyavaania or ilhamo kaa dhol peetane laga
 One example is taken from the book "that is our Krishna" written by Mirza, in this book - he has sent Nishkalanki avatar for the advancement and improvement of Hindus who have come in the exact era of which Krishna ji had given information from Pahile
 Have given us nishkalank avatar kaa naam mirza gulam ahamed hai jo kaadiyaan jila gurudaspur main prakat hue hai
 God has shown thousands of marks on his hand
 jo log un par imaan let hai unako khuda taala bada nur bakhshata hai
 Hears their prayers and removes the cast of people on their recommendation
 pratishtha detaa hai
 You should get Noor by reading their teachings
 If there is any doubt, then pray to God that God? If this person who declares to be from you and calls himself a clean avatar
 apni ghoshnaa main sachcha hai to uske maanane kii hame shakti pradaan kar or hamaare man ko is par imaan len ko khol de
 pun aap dekhege kii paramatma avashya aapako paroksh nishaanon se uski satyata par nishchay dilavaayega
 to aap satya hriday se meri or prerit ho or apni kathinaaiyon ke liye prarthana karaave allaah taala aapaki kathinaaiyon ko dur karegaa or muraad puri karegaa
 allaah aapke saath ho
 prishth 6,7
8 vahi hamaara krishna
 Pathakagan himself must have understood how Mirza was trying to fool innocent Hindus with his devious policies, but he did not turn his pulse on Pandit Lekhram like Ranveer
 pandit ji satya asaty kaa nirnay karne ke liye mirza ke aage teen prashn rakhe
 1
 First, Mirza ji learns to speak Sanskriti Sanskrit from his Ilhami Khuda and let the two well-qualified scholars of Aryasamaj, Pandit Devdat Shastri and Pandit Shyam ji Krishna Varma, plague the Sanskrit conversation
 2
 6 darshanon main se sirf teen ke aarsh bhashya milte hai
 If Mirza ji asks for the translation of the remaining three, i will accept Mirza's opinion
 3
 mujhe 20 varsh se bavasir kaa rog hai 
 yadi teen maas main mirza apni prarthana shakti se unhen thik kar de to main mirza ke paksh ko sweekaar kar loonga
 Pandit ji continued to write letters to him
 Being fed up, Mirza wrote that why do not we see miracles here? It was thought that neither Panditji's Qadian would come and Bala would be postponed
 But Panditji was firm in his tune and reached Kadian on Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's kothi
 do maas tak pandit ji qadian main rahe par mirza gulam ahamed koi bhi chamatkaar nahin dikhaa sakaa
 With this anger, Mirza started the propaganda against Aryasamaj, considering Aryasamaj and Pandit Lekhram as his arch enemies
 mirza ne brahine ahmadiya naamak pustak chanda maang kar chhapavai
 pandit ji ne uskaa uttar takazeeb brahine ahmadiya likhakar diya
 Mirza wrote the melodious spectacles Arya, which Pandit ji wrote by writing a reply to Khabte Ahmadiya
 Mirza made this prediction in the sunglasses Arya that within a year Panditji will be killed
 This prediction of Mirza turned out to be wrong and Pandit lived till 11 years after this

 On 6 March 1897, Panditji was working on the life character of Swami Dayanand in the house
 tabhi unhone ek angadaai lee ki us dusht ne pandit ji ko chura mar diya or bhaag gaya
 Pandit ji was taken to the hospital where he gave up his life at two o'clock in the night
 Pandit ji was not worried about his life, he was worried about Vedic religion

 khagolashastra main safed bouna yaa white dwarf ek chote taare ko bolaa jaataa he jo "apkrisht electron padaarth" kaa bana ho
 In the "non-electron electron" or "electron generated matter", the electrons separate from their atoms and disperse like a gas and the nucleus floats in it
 safed boune bahut ghaney hote hai - ve prithvi ke jitne chote aakaar main suraj ke jitna dravyaman rakh sakate hai
 It is believed that the stars that do not have enough mass to become neutron stars when they run out of fuel later, they all become white dwarfs

 Osteoporosis or osteoporosis is a bone disease that increases the risk of fractures
 osteoporosis main asthi khanij ghanatv kam ho jaataa he, asthi sookshm-sanrachana vighatit hoti he or asthi main asangrahit protein kii raashi or vividhta parivartit hoti he
 The World Health Organization has defined osteoporosis in women as the bone mineral density 2
5 standard deviations below the maximum bone mass as measured by DXA; The term "establishment of osteoporosis" also includes the presence of delicate fractures
 osteoporosis, mahilaon main rajonivritti ke baad sarvaadhik saamaanya he, jab use rajonivrittottar osteoporosis kehete hai, par yah purushon main bhi viksit ho saktaa he or yah kisi main bhi vishisht hormone sambandhi vikaar tathaa anya dirghakaalik bimariyon ke kaaran yaa aushadhiyon, vishesh rup se glucocorticoid ke parinamswaroop ho saktaa he, jab is beemaari ko steroid yaa glucocorticoid-prerit osteoporosis kaha jaataa he
 Given its effect, the risk of fragile fracture remains, bone weakness can significantly affect life expectancy and quality of life
 osteoporosis ko jivan-style main parivartan or kabhi-kabhi dawaaiyon se roka ja saktaa he; haddiyon kii kamazori vaale logon ke upachaar main donon shaamil ho sakati hai
 Changing lifestyles include exercising and preventing falls; Medicines include calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonate, and many others

 Exercise, with its anabolic effect, can at the same time stop or reverse osteoporosis
 osteoporosis ke sabhi maamalon main antarnihit pranali asthi avasorana or asthi-nirmaan ke bich asantulan he
 The normal bone contains a constant bone reproducibility matrix; At any given point of time, 10% of all bone mass undergoes reproduction
 jaisaa ki 1963 main frost ne pehali baar bataaya, yah prakriya asthi bahukoshikeey ikaayiyon main ghatit hoti he
 Bone is absorbed by osteoblast cells, after which new bone is deposited by osteoblast cells

 The amount of estrogen required to suppress this process is generally lower than the amount expected to stimulate the uterus and mammary gland
 asthi her-pher ke viniman main α-rup kaa estrogen receptor bahut mahatvapurn lagata he
 In bone manipulation, calcium metabolism plays an important role in addition to estrogen, and calcium and vitamin d deficiency leads to bone deposition atrophy; Additionally, the parathyroid glands respond to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone, which increases bone absorption to ensure adequate amounts of calcium in the blood
 asthi nickshepan ko badhaane vaali, thyroid dwaara utpaadit hormone calsitonin kii bhoomika kam spasht he or sambhawatah PTH kii tarah utani mahatvapurn nahin
 Activation of osteoblasts is regulated by various molecular signals, of which RANKL has been the most studied
 yah anu, asthikorak or anya koshikaon dwaara nirmit hota he or RANK ko uttejit karata he
 Osteoprotigerin combines RANKL before it has a chance to bind RANK and therefore suppresses its ability to increase bone absorption
 RANKL, RANK or OPG, tumor parigalan kaarak or uske grahiyon se nikat se jude hue hai
 The role of the Wnt signaling pathway has been accepted, but is poorly understood
 eicosnoid or interlukin ke sthaneey utpaadan ko, asthi her-pher ko niyantrit karne main bhaag lene vaala mana jaataa he or osteoporosis ke vikaas ke mul main in madhyasthon kaa adhik yaa kam utpaadan kaarak ho saktaa he
 The bony bone is the spongy bone located at the end of the long bones and vertebrae
 valkuteey asthi, haddiyon kaa kathor bahari kavach or lambii haddiyon kaa madhya he
 Because osteoblasts and osteoblasts reside on the surface of bones, the ligamentous bone is more active and subject to bone manipulation and regeneration
 na keval asthi ghanatv kam hota he, balki asthi kii sookshm-sanrachana baadhit hoti he
 The ligamentous bone weak bones are dislocated and replaced by weak bones
 aam osteoporotic asthi-bhang jagahen, yatha kalai, kuulhe or ridh kii haddi main valkuteey asthi se bandhakmay asthi kaa anupaat apekshaakrit ucch hota he
 These sites are dependent on the asymptomatic bone for strength, and therefore when the reproduction is unbalanced, rapid regeneration leads to weathering of these sites
 osteoporosis kaa apana koi vishesh lakshan nahin he; iskaa mukhya parinaam, asthi bhang kaa vardhit jokhim he
 Osteoporotic fractures occur in conditions where bone is not broken in healthy people in general; Hence they are considered to be fragile fractures
 vishisht najuk asthi-bhang kasheruki stambh, pasli, kuulhe or kalai main hote hai
 Symptoms of spinal cord depression are sudden back pain, often accompanied by nerve root pain and rarely with spinal compression or caudal cavity syndrome
 Multiple vertebral fractures cause long-term pain due to tingling, loss of height, consequent decrease in mobility
 lambii haddiyon ke asthi-bhang gatishiltaa par teevr kshati pahunchaate hai or shalya-chikitsa kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 Hip fractures in particular typically require immediate surgery, as hip fractures are associated with several serious risks such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary angiography and increased death
 badhati umr se jude girane ke jokhim main kalai, ridh or kuulhe kii haddi tut sakati he
 The risk of falling, respectively, is exacerbated by debilitating eyesight, balance disorder, mobility disorder, dementia, and sarcopenia for any reason

 Removal of obstructions and loose carpets in residential environments can significantly reduce falls
 jo pehle bhi gir chuke hon or jinaki chaal yaa santulan avyavasthit ho, unhen sabase zyada girane kaa khatara he
 Risk factors for osteoporotic fractures can be divided between non-variable and variable
 iske atirikt, aise vishisht rog tathaa vikaar maujuud hai, jinamein osteoporosis ek sweekrut samasya he
 Medication use is theoretically variable, although in many cases the use of drugs that increase the risk of osteoporosis is unavoidable
 osteoporosis ke liye sabase mahatvapurn jokhim kaarak he unnat umr or mahila ling; rajonivritti ke baad estrogen kii kami asthi khanij ghanatv kii teji se kami ke saath sah-sambhddha he, jabaki purushon main testosterone ke str main kami kaa tulanaatmak prabhaav padataa he
 Although osteoporosis occurs in people of all ethnic groups, people of European or Asian descent are already prone to osteoporosis

 There are at least 30 genes associated with the development of osteoporosis
 jin logon ko pehle hi ek fracture hua ho, unhen hamaumr or samalangik kisi vyakti kii tulana main dubaara fracture hone kii sambhaavna duguni hoti he
 Many diseases and disorders have been associated with osteoporosis
 kuch kaa maananaa he ki haddi upaapachay ko prabhavit karne vaali antarnihit vyavastha sidhi he, jabaki dusron ke liye, kaaran kai or agyaat hai
 Some drugs have been linked to increased osteoporosis risk; Classically, only steroids and anticonvulsants are associated, but evidence is emerging regarding other drugs as well
 osteoporosis kaa nidaan asthi khanij ghanatv ko maapne par kiya jaataa he
 Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry is the most popular method
 asaamaanya BMD kaa pataa lagane ke alaava, haddiyon kii kamajori ke nidaan ke liye sambhavit parivartaneey antarnihit kaarnon kii jaanch apekshit he; yah rakt-pareekshan or eks-re ke saath kiya ja saktaa he
 Depending on the likelihood of the original problem, cancer can be examined with bone deflections including multi-marrow, Cushing's disease and other factors mentioned above
 dohari urja eks-re avasoranamapi ko osteoporosis ke nidaan ke liye swarna maanak mana jaataa he
 Osteoporosis is diagnosed when the bone mineral density is less than or equal to 2
5 standard deviations of the young adult reference population
 ise T-score kaha jaataa he
 The World Health Organization has established the following guidelines: jab osteoporotic fracture bhi ho, jise ek khadi oonchai se girane kii vajah se ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he, tab shabd "gambhir yaa sthapit" osteoporosis kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The International Committee on Diagnostic Densitometry recognizes that osteoporosis in men under 50 years of age should not be diagnosed on the basis of density measurement criteria alone
 They also state that for pre-menopausal women, a Z-score should be used instead of a T-score, and that osteoporosis should not be diagnosed in such women as well, based on densification criteria alone

 Clinical prediction rules are available to conduct the selection of women aged 60–64 for screening
 sarvaadhik samvedansheel ranneeti osteoporosis jokhim moolyankan saadhan ho saktaa he
 In relation to the screening of men, a cost-analysis study suggests that the investigation "costs in cases of auto-reported pre-fractures in men 65 years of age and without pre-fractures in men 80 years and older" May be less "
 In addition, in middle-to-adult men, a significant reduction in testosterone levels, say less than 300, may be less expensive to detect
 ling ke aadhaar par osteoporosis kaa ilaaj karne ke liye kai dawaaon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Changes in lifestyle are also an aspect of treatment
 upachaar ke liye bisphosphonet mukhya aushadhiy upaay he
 However, in the 1990s, new drugs such as teriparatide and strontium renalate appeared
 pusht osteoporosis maamle main bisphosphonet dawaaen mahilaon ke upachaar-variyata kram main pratham rahi hai
 Commonly included in the prescription are bisphosphonate according to presently sodium alendronate 10 mg per day or 70 mg once a week, risadronate 5 mg per day or 35 mg once a week and or ibandronate once a month
 2007 nirmaataa-samarthit ek adhyayan kaa bataaya ki kam-prabhaav kulha asthi-bhang se peedit rogiyon main, 5 mg zoladronic amla ke vaarshik aadhaan ne kisi bhi fracture ke khatre ko 35% tak, kasheruki fracture ke khatre ko 3
8% se 1
7% tak or gaiyr-kasheruki fracture ke jokhim ko 10
7% se 7
6% tak kam kiya he
 The study also found mortality benefit after 1
9 years: 9
6% of the study group died due to any cause, indicating 28% mortality benefit
 maukhik bisphosphonet apekshaakrit kam avashoshit hote hai or isliye inhen khaali pet lenaa chahie, jahaan agle 30 minute tak koi bhojan yaa peya naa liya jaae

 Although intermittent doses with intravenous prescriptions such as zolendronate prevent oral tolerance problems, these factors are predominantly involved in a rare but unpleasant oral disease called mandibular osteonecrosis
 is kaaran se, maukhik bisphosphonet chikitsa ko sambhawatah tarjeeh di jaani chahie or ab doctor yah anushansa karte hai ki upachaar se purv hi koi bhi upachaaratmak danta kaary kar lenaa chahie
 Recently, teriparatide has been found to be effective against osteoporosis
 yah paratharid hormone kii tarah kaam karata he or asthikorak uttejit karata he or is prakaar unki gatividhi badhati he
 It is used mostly for patients with osteoporosis, especially those with low BMD or multiple fracture risk factors, or who cannot tolerate oral biophosphonates
 yah kalam jaise ek injection upkaran ke istemaal ke saath dainik injection ke rup main diya jaataa he
 In some countries, teriparatide can be used for treatment only if biophosphonates fail or are prohibited
 purv vikiran chikitsa yaa paget rog vaale mariz yaa yuva marijon ko is dawa se bachanaa chahie
 Oral strontium renalate is an alternative oral treatment, which belongs to a class of drugs that its manufacturer has named "dual action bone agents"
 isane vishesh rup se kasheruki fracture ke nivaaran main apni kshamta sabit kar di he
 Laboratory experiments noted that strontium renalate promotes the proliferation of osteoblasts, as well as restricts the proliferation of osteoblasts
 stronsium rinlate ko har rose 2g maukhik nilamban ke rup main liya jaataa he or kasheruki or hip fracture ko rokane ke liye haddiyon kii kamajori ke upachaar hetu ise license di gai he
 Strongium renlate has a side effect effect compared to bisphosphonate, as it does not produce any type of upper GI adjunctive effect, which is the most common reason for drug withdrawal in osteoporosis

 However, strontium citrate is available from many well-known vitamin manufacturers in the US
 adhikansh shodhakartaaon kaa maananaa he ki stronsium bhale hi kisi rup main prayukt ho, vah surakshit or prabhavi he
 The Rheinlet type is only a tool invented by the French Servier Company to patent its version of strontium
 strontium, chaahe uskaa koi bhi rup ho, pani main ghulne yogya or udar amla main ynit hona chahie
 stronsium ko tab antra nalee se rakt pravaah main vahan ke liye protein-baddh kiya jaataa he
 Unlike drugs such as sodium alendronate, strontium does not inhibit bone reorientation and, in fact, can produce stronger bones
 adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki paanch saal ke baad alendronet asthi kshay kaa kaarak bhi ho saktaa he, jabaki stronsium jivan-kaal ke dauraan prayukti se haddi kaa nirmaan jari rakhata he
 Strontium should not be taken with diet or calcium-rich dishes, as calcium competes with strontium during levitation
 phir bhi, yah zaruri he ki har rose calcium, magnesium or chikitsiya maatra main vitamin di lenaa chahie, lekin stronsium lete samay main nahin
 stronsium ko raat main khaali pet lenaa chahie
 Estrogen replacement treatment is a good treatment for the prevention of osteoporosis, but at this time, unless other indications for its use are available, it is not recommended

 In contrast, despite previous reports of elevated high lipoprotein density in calcium supplements, a possible increase in the rate was found
 yadi pushti ho, yah sanket detaa he ki fracture ke kam jokhim vaali mahilaon main calcium kii poorakta se achche se zyada nuksaan hi ho saktaa he
 Some studies have shown that an overdose of vitamin d reduces bone fractures in the elderly, although the Women's Health Initiative found that although calcium and vitamin d increased bone density by 1%, it increased hip bone -did not affect the atrophy, but increased the formation of kidney stones by 17%
 kai adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki airobics, bhaar sahan or pratirodh abhyaas sabhi rajonivrutottar mahilaon main BMD ko banaae rakh sakate hai yaa badha sakate hai
 Many researchers have tried to indicate which exercises are most effective in improving BMD and other metrics of bone quality, but results have varied
 rajonivrutottar mahilaon main niyamit rup se ek saal ke liye kud abhyaas se BMD or sannikat tibia kii niskriyata ke kshan kii vruddhi prathit hoti he
 Treadmill walking, exercise training, walking, jumping, endurance and strength exercises all resulted in significant increases of L2-L4 BMD in post-menopausal women
 Strength training led to an improvement in BMD of the distal radius and hip, in particular
