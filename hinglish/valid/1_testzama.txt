 ek alumnas yaa alumna ek purv chaatr hota he or visheshtah ek shaikshik santhaan se oopaadhi praapt hota he
 According to the United States Department of Education, the term alumni is used as the convenor of either women's colleges, or women's student groups

 uski praarambhik shiksha apni mata kii dekharekh main hui thi, jo apane samay ke "pavitra maarg" naamak dharmik andolan se bahut prabhavit thi
 Therefore, at an early age, he was interested in righteous conduct, simple, well-organized and professional life
 16 varsh kii aayu main, "collegium fidericaanum" kii shiksha samaapt kar, vah konigsburg ke vishvavidhyalay main pravisht hua, jahaan chah varsh usne bhautikashastra, ganit, darshan evam dharamshastra kaa adhyayan kiya
 For nine years after leaving university, Kant moved to a village called Judskin, 60 miles from Königsberg
 vahaan vah do teen pariwaron main adhyaapan kaary kar apni jeevika chalaata or bhautikashastra tathaa darshan main swadhyay karata rahaa
 In the meantime, many of his articles and epics were published, two of which are "special Considerations on the Approximation of Living Powers" and "general Natural History and Theory of the Akash"

 He had also submitted the necessary arrangements for the degree of "doctor's Legacy" in 1755 AD and the University of Königsberg certified his qualification by granting him the said degree
 kintu uski vyaktigat samasyaon main koi parivartan na hua
 Pleased with his nine years of hard work, the university had appointed him a distinguished lecturer, but he did not get paid for this work

 1766 i
 main use adhyaapan ke saath-saath sahaayak pustkaalay prabandhak bhi niyukt kiya gaya or ab use das pound vaarshik vetan milane laga
 For four years, Kant also worked in this form, but he continued to study, think and write
 "privet dogent" niyukt hone ke baad se 1770i tak uske paanch prakaran granth prakashit hue– The titles of the above texts suggest that the time between 1755 and 1770 AD was the creation of Kant's ideas

 In the same year, he was appointed to the same teacher of logic and philosophy at the University of Königsberg, for which he had to be disappointed 12 years ago
 pehle se ab vah chintamukt bhi ho gaya tha kyonki use 60 pound vaarshik vetan milane laga tha
 In those days, such salaries were paid only to respectable teachers

 Kant earned only 30 pounds from his "critique of Pure Reason"

 Even after 1796 AD, he was busy studying, thinking and writing, but these eight years of his life were spent in a very pathetic condition
 uski smriti itani ksheen ho gai thi ki use choti-moti baaten bhi likhakar yaad rakhni padati thim
 He did not have the power to take care of his own house; He did not marry, but during the teaching period of 42 years, he made a good impression on his colleagues and students

 a German poet named Hyne has spoken in praise of Kant's philosophical life that proves him eccentric, but his ideas have influenced the subsequent philosophy so much that Kant's scholar considers him the originator of a new era in philosophy

 After being arrested by the British Army, he committed suicide before being questioned
 henrik himalar kaa janm munich main ek roman catholic bavarian madhya-vargeey parivaar main hua tha
 His father Joseph Gebhard Himmler was a secondary school teacher and principal of the prestigious Wittelbecker Gymnasium

 He had an older brother, Gebhard Ludwig Himmler, born July 29, 1898; And a younger brother, Ernst Hermann Himmler, who was born on 23 December 1905
 henrik kaa naam unke dharmpita bavaria ke shahi parivaarake prince henrik of bavaria ke naam par padaa tha, jinhen gebhard himalar padhaayaa karte the
 In 1910, Himmler was admitted to the Gymnasium of Landshut, where he studied fine literature

 Throughout his youth from his adult years, Himmler was never comfortable in relationships with women
 himalar kii diariyon se pataa chalata he ki unhen yuddh sambandhi khabaron main bahut zyada dilchaspee thi
 He pleaded with his father to use his royal contacts to get him the post of an officer candidate
 uske mata-pita ne antat baat maan lee or unhen 11veen bavarian regiment se prashikshan lene kii anumati de di
 Since he was not an athletic, he had to struggle a lot during his military training
 The war ended in 1918 with the defeat of Germany, thus ending Himmler's aspirations to become a professional army officer
 1919 se 1922 tak himalar ne munich technisk hokshul se krishi vigyaan kii padhai kii, uske baad kuch dinon tak ek farm main prashikshan lene ke baad ve biimaar pad gayi
 In his diary he claims to be a devout Roman Catholic and has written that he can never leave the Roman Church
 However, he was a member of a fraternity and later joined the Thule Society and felt that both of these relations did not coincide with the principles of the Church
 Biographers define Himmler's theology as Eriosophy, his own Aryan racial superiority and the theological hegemony of Germanic meso-paganism, partly from his own interpretation of the folklore of northern Europe and the mythology of ancient Teutonic tribes

 He wrote that if Germany does not enter the war soon, they will go to another country to request war

 henrik or margaret himalar 1940 main bina talaak liye hi alag ho gayi
 Himmler at that time became friends with Hedwig Potthast, a secretary
 jisane 1941 main apni naukari chhod di or unki shrimati ban gayi
 With this he became the father of two children - a son Helge and a daughter Nanette Dorothia

 At that time, the SS had 280 members and the very large Sturmabteilung was just one elite battalion
 agle saal, himalar ne sanghathan main ek bada vistaar shuru kiya or 1930 main, unhen pronnati dekar eses-gruppenfuharer bana diya gaya 
 By 1933, the SS had 52,000 members
 sanghathan ne sakht sadsyta lagu karte hue yah sunishchit kiya ki sabhi sadsy hitler ke aryan herrenvolk ke hon
 himalar or unke sahyogi reinhard hedrick ne eses ko ese ke niyantran se baahar karne kaa prayaas shuru kiya
 In July 1932, black SS uniforms were replaced by SA brown shirts, and by 1934 enough uniforms were ready for the general use of all
 1933 main, himalar ko padonnati dekar eses-obergruppenfuharer bana diya gaya
 This made him the equivalent of the senior SA commander, who now hated the SS and was jealous of its power
 himalar, harman goring or general varnor won blomberg is baat par sahamat the ki ese or uske netaa ernest roham german sena or naji ke samaksh ek khatra ban rahe hai
 Röhm was of socialist and populist views and believed that the real revolution had not yet begun
 unhone mahasoos kiya ki ese ko desh kaa ekmaatr astradhari sainya dal hona chahie
 For this reason some Nazi, military and political leaders felt that Rohm wanted to overthrow the use of SA
 himalar or goring ke uksaane par, roham ke khatme ke liye hitler sahamat ho gayi
 He entrusted this task to Reinhard Hedrick, Kurt Daluage and Warner Best, who ordered the extermination of Rohm and other senior officials; Also ordered to eliminate some of Hitler's personal enemies, these works were done on 30 June 1934, which is known as Night of the Clove Knife
 agle din, eses ek swatantra sanghathan ban gaya, jo sirf hitler ke prati javabdeh tha or himalar kaa rikhfuharer-eses kaa khitaab eses kaa aupchaarik sarvocch pad ban gaya
 On 20 April 1934, Göring formed a partnership with Himmler and Hedrick
 goring ne gestapo, prashia kii jasusi sanstha, ke praadhikaar kaa sthanantaran kar uskaa jimmaa himalar ko saunp diya, jinhen prashia ke baahar german police kaa pramukh bhi bana diya gaya
 On 22 April 1934, Himmler appointed Hedrick as head of the Gestapo
 hedrick esady ke bhi pramukh bane rahe
 On 17 June 1936, Himmler was made head of the German police after Hitler announced his decision to "consolidate the police control of the Reich"
 paramparaagat rup se, germany main kanoon pravartan ek rajyastareey or sthaneey maamla tha
 In this role, Himmler was nominally subordinate to Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick
 However, the decree effectively merged the police with the SS, making it almost independent of Frick's control
 germany kii sabhi vardidhari kaanoon pravartan agenciyon ke ek nae ordanugspolizi main ek hone se himalar kii takat badhi, is nayi sanstha kaa mukhyalay eses kii ek mukhyalay shakha ban gaya
 Despite his title, Himmler gained only partial control of the uniformed police

 In 1943, when Himmler was appointed interior minister, the transfer of ministerial power was completed

 This merger was never completed within the Reich, Kripo remained mainly under the control of his civil administration and later became a party tool
 Although the occupied territories were not included in the original Reich, Sipo's integration within the ss's command line proved mostly effective
 sitambar 1939 ko, dwitiya yuddh ke aarambh ke baad, himalar ne rikhassikarheitshauptamt kaa gathan kiya, jahaan sipo tathaa shricherheitsdienst hedrick kii kaman ke vibhaag ban gayi
 Himmler oversaw the system of the entire torture camp
 Once World War II began, new detention camps not formally classified as torture camps were established, with no control of Himmler and the SS
 1943 main, stalingrad tabaahi ke parinamswaroop shashan kii lokapriy maukhik aalochana kii aalochana ke prakope ke baad party ne in aalochanaon ko roak paane main gestapo kii vifaltaa par niraashaa jaahir kii, polithische staffeln ke rup main apane raajnneetik police ang kii sthapana kii, is tarah is kshetra main gestapo ke ekadhikaar ko tod diya gaya
 During these years the SS developed its military arm ss-verfügungstruppe, which later developed into the waffen-ss
 naam ke liye himalar ke maatahat hone ke baavjood wafphen-eses ko puri tarah se ek sainya dhaanche main dhaala gaya or veharmat ke samanaantar yuddh prayaas main shaamil hone laayak viksit kiya gaya
 Many contemporary commentators refused to recognize the waffen-ss as a respectable military organization
 isaki ikaiyaan nagarikon or nihathe kaidiyon kii hatya kii kukhyat ghatnaon main shaamil thim
 This was also one of the reasons that the International Military Tribunal declared the SS a criminal organization
 nit of da nives ke baad, eses-totancopaverbande ne germany ke yatnaa shiviron kii sthapana kii or prashasit kiya, 1941 ke baad, poland main sanhaar shivi bhi banaaye
 The SS, through its Intelligence Branch Security Service, began putting Jews, Gypsies, Communists, and other cultural, racial, political or religious individuals whom the Nazis considered either Antarmensch or anti-regime, into concentration camps
 22 march 1933 ko himalar ne dachaau main aise pehle shivi kaa aarambh kiya
 He was the main architect of the Holocaust, he used elements of mysticism and a staunch belief in racist Nazi doctrine to justify the killing of millions
 Himmler had a similar plan for the Poles; The intellectuals were to be killed and they believed that the other Polish people were merely literate to understand the traffic signals
 himalar ke mulaakaat pustika se pataa chalata he ki 18 disambar 1941 ko himalar kii bhent hitler ke saath hui thi
 In the Indraj of that day the question was raised "what should be done with the Jews of Russia?" And then the answer to the question was "als partisanane oszurotan"
 hitler ke bajaay himalar yatnaa shiviron kaa nirikshan kiya karte
 in nirikshanon ke parinamswarup, naajiyon ne hatya kaa ek nayaa or bhi adhik samichin upaay khoj nikaala, jisase gas chambaron kaa istemaal shuru hua
 Himmler wanted a ruling breed of Nordic Aryans in Germany
 ek murgipalak kisaan ke rup main unhone apane anubhav se pashu prajnan ke mul tatv ko siikhaa tha, jise ve maanav jati par prasthaapit karnaa chaahate the
 They believed that they could replace the German population by selective breeding with excellent progeny, which would become completely "nordic" several decades after the war
 4 oktober 1943 ko, himalar ne pojnan shahar main eses kii ek gupt baithak main spasht rup se yahudee janata ke khatme kaa ullekh kiya
 The following is an excerpt from an transcript of an audio recording of speech: i am now referring to the evacuation of the Jews, to the extermination of the Jewish People
 This is something that is easily said: 'the Jewish People will be exterminated', says every Party member, 'this is very obvious, it is in our program — elimination of the Jews, extermination, a small matter
' And then they turn up, the upstanding 80 million Germans, and each one has his decent Jew
 They say the others are all swine, but this particular one is a splendid Jew
 But none has observed it, endured it
 Most of you here know what it means when 100 corpses lie next to each other, when there are 500 or when there are 1,000
 To have endured this and at the same time to have remained a decent person — with exceptions due to human weaknesses — has made us tough, and is a glorious chapter that has not and will not be spoken of
 Because we know how difficult it would be for us if we still had Jews as secret saboteurs, agitators and rabble rousers in every city, what with the bombings, with the burden and with the hardships of the war
 If the Jews were still part of the German nation, we would most likely arrive now at the state we were at in 1916 and '17 
 
 
 
 —heinrich Himmler, 4 October 1943 Bricha Surviving Remnant Displaced persons In 1939 Himmler planned Operation Himmler, controversially it was the first World War II operation in Europe
 1941 main soviet sangh par akraman ke pehle himalar ne apane eses ko "judeo-bolshevvaad" kii takaton ke khilaaf sanhaar yuddh ke liye taiyaar kiya tha
 Himmler was always happy by comparing Nazi Germany and the Middle Ages, comparing the invasion to the Crusade
 They collected volunteers from all over Europe, especially Nordic people who were considered racially closest to the Germans, such as Dens, Norwegians, Swedes and Dutch
 After the invasion, Ukrainians, Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonian volunteers were also reinstated, attracting non-german volunteers by declaring an all-european crusade to protect the traditional values of Old Europe from the "atheist Bolshevik gang"
 hajaaron swechha se bhartee hue or usase bhi kahin zyada log jabariyaa bhartee kiye gayi
 The natives of the Baltic states were ready to act against the Red Army, as the persecution aroused hatred after being annexed by the Soviet Union
 in logon ko jabaran wafphen-eses main bhartee kiya gaya tha, inhen soviet sena ke khilaaf laga diya gaya, tab ye kushi ke saath is kaam main jute gayi
 Western and Nordic Europe found very few people to recruit the waffen-ss, but several waffen-ss army units were established, such as the Vallonian military contingent led by Leon Degrelle, who regained Nazi territory after the war Himmler had plans to become Chancellor of Burgundy
 1942 main, himalar ke daahine haath reinhard hedrick kii praha ke kareeb ek hamale ke baad check vishesh sena ke haathon maare gayi, check sena ko british kufia vibhaag tathaa checkoslov vidrohiyon se sahaayta mil rahi thi

 1943 main, himalar ko us frick kii jagah rikh kaa aantarik mantri niyukt kiya gaya, jiske saath ve ek dashak se bhi adhik samay se sangharshrat the
 For example, Frick had tried to limit the widespread use of "defensive detention" to send people to concentration camps for the purpose of merely confessing to Himmler
 yatnaa shiviron ko frick bhinnmtavalambiyon ko dandit karne ke ek upkaran ke rup main dekha karte, jabaki himalar kii raay main in shiviron ke jariye logon ko aatankit karke naji shashan ko sweekaar karana tha
 Himmler's appointment effectively merged the interior ministry with the SS
 himalar ne apane nae karyaalay kaa istemaal lok seva se party upkaran ke sangyojan ko ulatney main kiya or jila-kshetreey str ke party netaaon ke adhikaron ko chunauti deni shuru kii
 Hitler's personal secretary and party chancellor Martin Bormann's blow to his ambition came as a shock
 khud hitler se bhi ise kuch naaraazgi jhelni padi, jinke naji prashasan kii soch kii ek neenv paaramparik lok seva ke prati lambey samay se ghrinaa rahi
 After becoming the chief of the Reserve Army, Himmler made the situation worse, he transferred policemen to the waffen-ss and tried to use the powers of both the army and the police
 apane satta ke aadhaar ko himalar chunauti dete rahe, lekin borman ne unhen teji se aage badhane kaa mauqaa nahin diya, haalanki virodh shuru hone ke pehle tak shuruyaat main ve chup rahe the
 Then, as Bormann began opposing the plan, Himmler began to be disgraced, especially in the party, whose goliators, ie local leaders, began to see Bormann as their protector
 yah nirdhaarit hua tha ki german sena ke kufia vibhaag ke bade adhikari or khud uske pramukh admiral wilhilm canaaris hitler kii htya kii 20 july 1944 kii sajeesh main shaamil the
 For this reason Hitler decided to dissolve Abwehr and make Himmler's security service the only intelligence service of the Third Reich
 isse himalar kii vyaktigat shakti main vruddhi hui
 The commander-in-chief of the Reserve Army, General Frederick Fromm, was implicated in a conspiracy

 Unfortunately for Himmler, the investigation soon revealed the involvement of SS officers in the conspiracy, including some senior officers who used to follow Borman's struggle against SS at his behest, as very few party workers gave officers Was implicated
 isse bhi adhik mahatvapurn baat yah he ki eses ke kuch varisht adhikari khud himalar ke viruddh shadyantr karne lage, kyonki unka maananaa tha ki borman ke khilaaf satta sangharsh main unki jeet nahin ho sakati
 in dalbadaluon main hedrick ke uttaradhikari rikhsicherheitsahauptamt ke pramukh ernest kaltembrunner or gestapo ke pramukh gruppenfuharer henrikh mular bhi the
 In late 1944, Himmler became the commander-in-chief of the newly formed Army Group Upper Rhine
 rin ke pashchimi tat par alsaas kshetra main aage badhati hui america 7veen army or francisi 1lee army se ladane ke liye is army group kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 The American 7th Army was under the command of General Alexander Patch and the French 1st Army, General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny
 1 janvari 1945 ko, himalar ke army group ne americanyon or francisiyon ko peeche dhakelne ke liye oparation north wind shuru kiya
 In late January, Himmler was moved eastwards after some limited initial success
 24 janvari tak, rakshaatmak hone ke kaaran army group apper rin ko niskriy kar diya gaya
 Operation North Wind officially ended on 25 January
 duusari ore, german sena laal fuj ke vistula-odher aakraamakata ko roak paane main vifal rahi, tab hitler ne himalar ko ek anya navgathit sainya group kaa kaman saunpa, is army group vistula ko berlin kii ore badhati soviet sena ko rokna tha
 Despite the failure of the Army Group Upper Rhine and his complete lack of experience and inability to lead the Army troops, Hitler entrusted Himmler to the Army Group Vistula
 yah niyukti martin borman ke uksaane par hui ho sakati he, taaki pratidwandvi ko badnaam kiya ja sake, yaa phir sainya adhikariyon kii "vifaltaa" par hitler ke badhate gusse kii vajah se hui ho sakati he
 As commander-in-chief of the Army Group Vistula, Himmler established his command center at Schneidemühl
 ve apni vishesh train, sonderzug stearmark, ko apane mukhyalay ke rup main istemaal karte
 train main sirf ek telephone line hone or koi signal vilgan nahin hone ke baavjood himalar ne aisa kiya
 Eager to show his tenacity, Himmler quietly accepted the military officers' quick-attack urge
 oparation jald hi daldal main funs gaya or himalar ne ek niyamit army commander ko barkhaast kar diya or naji henge lammerding ko niyukt kiya
 His headquarters were also forced to retreat to Falconburg
 On 30 January, Himmler issued a brutal order: Todd und Straफेe für Flichtwergesensheit - "death and punishment for those who forget their obligations," to encourage their army
 bigadati sthiti ke kaaran himalar par hitler kaa dabaav badhata gaya; ve sammelnon main anishchayatmak or baichaiyn rahane lage
 Himmler's forces launched Pomeranian aggression in mid-february, under the direction of General Walther Venk, under the tremendous pressure of General Heinz Guderian on Hitler
 march ke aarambh tak, himalar kaa mukhyalay odher nadi ke pashchim le jaaya gaya, haalanki unki sena kaa naam ab bhi vistula ke naam par hi rahaa
 In conferences with Hitler, he continued to support Hitler's policy of increasing the tighter with those who retreated
 13 march ko, himalar ne apane cmand ko chhod diya, ve beemaari kaa daawa karne lage or hohenlichen ke ek aspataal main bhartee ho gayi
 Guderian met him there and took his resignation from the commander-in-chief of the Army Group Vistula and handed it over to Hitler that same night
 20 march ko, himalar ke sthaan par gotthard henriki ko general banaaya gaya
 In the winter of 1944–45, Himmler's waffen-ss had a membership number of 910,000, as well as about two million members of the allgomen-ss
 haalanki, 1945 kii shuruyaat main german jeet par se himalar kaa vishwaas uth gaya, khaskar apane maalisia felics karston or walter shelenberg ke saath baatcheet se
 unhone mahasoos kiya ki agar naji shashan ko bachaana he to iske liye britain or sanyukt rajya america ke saath shanti vaarta jaruri he
 He also believed that Hitler made himself helpless by staying in Berlin to personally defend the capital against the Soviet Union
 isliye unhone danish seemaa ke paas lubek main sweden ke count pholk barnadot se sampark kiya
 He introduced himself as the immediate leader of Germany and told Bernadotte that Hitler would almost certainly die within two days
 unhone barnadot kaha ki ve general dwit ijanhaavar se kahen ki germany pashchim ke saamne aatmasamarpan karnaa chahta he
 Himmler hoped that the British and Americans would fight the Soviet Union along with the remaining Wehrmacht
 barnadot ke anurodh par, himalar ne apana prastaav likhakar diya
 On the evening of 28 April, the BBC broadcast a Reuters news report about Himmler's attempts to negotiate with the Western Allies
 jab hitler ko is samachar ke bare main bataaya gaya to vah gusse se agbabula ho gayi
 a few days ago, Herman Göring sought permission from Hitler to take the lead of the Reich - Hitler's provocation was interpreted as if he was being threatened by a chair or a coup
 haalanki, himalar ne anumati ke liye anurodh karne kii bhi parvaah nahin kii
 Hitler was also severely shocked by this news because he considered Himmler to be his second greatest loyalist after Joseph Goebbels; In fact, Hitler often called Himmler "der true Heinrich"
 shant ho jane ke baad hitler ne apane saath bunker main tab bhi maujuud logon se kaha ki unki jaankaree main himalar kaa yah krity vishwasghaat kaa sabase kharaab udhaaharan he
 In addition to Himmler's betrayal, the news that the Soviet army was only 300 meters from the Chancellory forced Hitler to write his last will and testament
 aatmahatya karne se pehle ke din puraa kar liye vasietname main unhone himalar or goring ko gaddaar ghoshit kiya
 He removed Himmler from all his party and government positions: he was removed from the posts of the reichführer-ss, the chief of the German police, the commissioner of the German Nationhood, the interior minister of the Reich, the Supreme Commander of the Volksström, and the Supreme Commander of the Home Army
 ant main, unhone himalar ko naji party se nishkasit karte hue unki giraftaar kaa aadesh diya
 Himmler's negotiations with Count Bernadotte failed
 iske baad unhone grand admiral karl donitz kii sharan lee, ve tab pion ke paas pashchimi morche par uttari hisse ke sabhi german sena kaa netritv kar rahe the
 Donitz returned Himmler, saying that he had no place in the new German government
 haalanki, baatcheet se baaqi bache yatnaa shiviron se koi 15,000 scandavian kaidiyon kii rihaai sambhav ho paayi
 After this Himmler approached the Americans like a defection, by contacting the headquarters of Eisenhower, claiming to surrender to the Allies of Germany, and conditioned them to be spared
 He asked Eisenhower to make him "police minister" of the Germany government post-war
 He reportedly began to ponder on how he would hold the first meeting with the commander of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Force and salute him or shake hands with him
 ailanhavar ne himalar se kisi prakaar ke samjhaute se inkaar kar diya or saath hi unhen ek bada yuddh apradhi ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Undaunted by his former allies and the search by the Allies, Himmler wandered around Flenberg near the Danish border for several days
 giraftaar se bachane ke liye, unhone khufia sainya police ke sargent-major kaa vesh dhaaran kiya, apana naam henrikh hitjinger rakhaa, apni moonch kaat lee or apni baayin aankh par ek pattee laga lee, is ummid main ki ve bavaria waapas ja paayenge

 His last words were Ich bin Heinrich Himmler! 
 Another statement is that when a British doctor was searching, Himmler had chewed the cyanide pill hidden in his teeth, upon which the doctor shouted, "it has done its job!" Several attempts to rescue Himmler failed
 sheeghra hi baad main, luneburg hith main ek achihnit kabr main himalar kaa shav dafna diya gaya
 The exact location of Himmler's tomb is unknown
 may 2008 ko, ek british police jaanch ne "29 jaalsajiyon kii pahchaan kii jo 2000 ke baad 12 filon main gum thi", jinka istemaal haal main himalar ke shadyantron or anumaanon ko sabit karne main kiya gaya
 The Financial Times report further states "fraudsters are cited as sources by a historian who wrote three books on World War II

 jabaki anya logon kaa maananaa he ki himalar satalobhi the, jo apni shakti or prabhaav badhaane main jute rahe
 According to Robert S
 Wistrick, Himmler's decisive innovation was that he transformed a racial-like question from "a negative view based on anti-semitism" to "an organizational task for the creation of the SS"
 

 yah himalar kaa hi kamaal tha ki kisi paap bodh or jimmedaari ke bina hi ve eses ke dimag main sarvanashi "adarshavaad" bharne main kaamyaab rahe, jisane narsanhaar or kisiike prati kathorta ko ek shahadatki tarah yuktisangat banaaya
 The wartime cartoonist Victor Weisz depicts Himmler as a giant octopus, holding the afflicted nations in its eight arms

" Himmler told his personal masseur Felix Kirsten that he always kept a copy of the Bhagavad-gītā with him, so that it would not give him a sense of sin in implementing the final solution; They felt that they were only doing their duty like the warrior Arjuna, without having any attachment to their actions
 himalar ke vichaar sambhawatah gita kii apni vyakhya se vyutpann jacob vihelm hauer ke vichaaron se prabhavit thi
 In an excerpt from Norman Brooke's book War Cabinet Diaries, Winston Churchill advised Himmler to assassinate him during the war, given his wide share in the war
 brooke ke anusaar, naji netaaon ko prandand die jane kii ek salaah kii pratikriya main, "churchill ne poocha ki kya unhen himalar se baaten kerani chahie or baad main unhen dhakka maar diya jaay, ek baar shanti sharten puri ho jane ke baad
 himalar ke saath german samarpan kii vaarta karne or baad main unki hatya kar daalane kii salaah ko grih karyaalay kaa samarthan praapt hua
 'suzav himalar ke saath german aatmasamarpan ek saude ke liye katautee karne ke liye or phir use hatya Office Home se mulaakaat ke saath samarthan karte hai
 'aisa karne kaa puraa hakdaar he', baithak kii likhit vivarani main kii tippanee darj he
" The main issue of a recent work is that for which he kept competing and to what extent Himmler went to grab Hitler's attention and get respect
 yuddh ke antim dinon kii ghatnaayen, jab unhone hitler ko chhod diya or mitra rashtron ke saath alag se vaarta shuru kii, is sambandh main spashtatah mahatvapurn hai
 Himmler seems to have had a distorted view of how they are viewed by the Allies; He hoped that he would meet American and British leaders and talk with them "like a gentleman"
 antim kshanon main apane viruddh unke pratishodh kii bhaavana ko samaapt karne kii cheshtaa main unhone yahudiyon or mahatvapurn kaidiyon ke dand sthagit rakhe
 unhen giraftaar karne vaale british sainikon ke anusaar, himalar is baat par sahi myne main hairaan the ki unke saath kaidiyon jaisaa vyavhaar kiya jaayegaa
 In 2008, Himmler was dubbed "the greatest massacre of all time" by the German news magazine Der Spiegel, reflecting his role as the architect of the demolition
 jabaki aadhunik germany main unki satat saarvajanik abhigyata pratibimbit ho rahi he, lekin demosida par sankhyikeey shodh darshaate hai ki ye daawey bahut hi adhik atiranjak hai, yahaan tak ki jab unki nijee jimmevary ko hitler or unke anya sahaayakon ke saath samuhik rup se mana jaataa he
 Dates of higher posts 1929 ke baad se hi himalar keval rikhsfuhrer ke apane khitaab se khud kaa ullekh kiya karte the; jo ki 1934 tak unka asli pad nahin tha
 Award eses ke pramukh ke rup main, himalar main ansi adwitiya kshamta thi ki ve anek naji sena, naagarik or raajnneetik padakon se "khud ko puraskrit" karne kii sthiti main the
 However, Himmler's official awards and accolades qualified him primarily for service medals and merit cats, apparently under the scheme
 kai sheersh naji netaaon kii tarah himalar khud ke liye bhavy puraskaar or alankaranon kii zarurat mahasoos nahin karte the, balki in oopaadhiyon ko andolan ke kanishtha sadasyon ke liye bachaakar rakhte, jo aise puraskaron ko ek prerana ke rup main dekha karte the
 For this purpose, Himmler was not awarded the Iron Cross and even the War Merit Cross, while he was almost certain to be awarded for his work as SS and Chief of Police
 himalar ke adhikrut alankaar nimnlikhit hai: Himmler also received many foreign awards from friends of Germany, the most notable among them being the high ranking honors given to Himmler from Romania and Italy
 Himmler was decorated with several German state adornments, the most important being the honors he received from Bavaria, where he had previously served as police chief
 himalar kabhi-kabhaar hi in atirikt padakon ko dhaaran kiya karte the, sirf un aupchaarik sarkari samarohon ko chhodkar jahaan puri vardi main in sabakaa hona jaruri hota

 During this movement, there was tremendous mobilization in Assam's territory to drive outsiders, especially those from Bangladesh

 Assam has a long history of outsiders
 aupniveshik prashasan ne hazaron bihariyon or bengaaliyon ko yahan aakar basane, yahan ke chaay baganon main kaam karne or khaali padi zamin par kheti karne ke liye protsaahit kiya
 At that time, Assam had a very small population
 aise main assam ke bhumipatiyon ne bengali jotdaaron or bihari mazaduron kaa khulkar swaagat kiya
 Between 1939 and 1947, Muslim communal forces also encouraged Bengali Muslims to settle in Assam

 After partition, a large number of Bengali people came from newly created East Pakistan to West Bengal and Tripura as well as Assam

 Most of these returned after the formation of Bangladesh, but around one lakh people remained there
 1971 ke baad bhi bade paimaane par bangladeshiyon kaa assam main aana jari rahaa
 In such a situation, the farmers and natives of Assam started to fear that their property would be taken over by people from Bangladesh
 jansankhya main hone vaale is badlaav ne muulavaasiyon main bhashaai, saanskrithik or raajnneetik asuraksha kii bhaavana paidaa kar di
 This sentimentalized the people of Assam and especially the youth there

 This fear of the people was not completely wrong either

 It is noteworthy that this region underwent a special political renaissance in the nineteenth century and especially after independence, which instilled a sense of pride among the people of Assam for their language, culture, literature, folk art and music
 rajya kii saanskrithik, bhashaai or dharmik vividhta ko dekhte hae yah ek jatil prakriya thi
 Many people who have supported the unified Assamese culture have also been of the view that by giving exclusive rights to tribal areas separately or by building separate states like Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, the central government has built a comprehensive Assamese identity

 ol assam student union or kshetreey raajnneetik, saahitiyik or saanskrithik sanghathanon se milakar bani assam gana sangram parishad ne bahiraagton ke kilaaf andolan ched diya
 Significantly, Asu as a student organization existed since the British era
 us samay uskaa naam tha ahom chaatr sammilan
 But in 1940 the organization split and in 1967 the two factions merged again and the organization was renamed All Assam Students Association
 lekin phir iskaa naam badalakar ol assam student union yaa aasu kar diya gaya
 Hindus, Muslims and many Bengalis speaking Assamese language openly supported the movement launched by Asu
 andolan ke netaaon ne yah daawa kiya ki rajya kii jansankhya kaa 31 se 34 pratishat bhaag baahar se gair-kanoonee rup se aaye logon kaa he
 He asked the Central Government to seal the boundaries here to prevent outsiders from coming to Assam, identify illegal outsiders and remove their names from the voter list and until such time someone in Assam Do not conduct elections
 andolan ne yah maang bhi rakhi ki 1961 ke baad rajya main aane vaale logon ko unke mul rajya main waapas bheja jaae yaa kahin duusari jagah basaaya jaae
 This movement received such strong support that in 1984, elections could not be held in 14 parliamentary constituencies from sixteen parliamentary constituencies
 1979 se 1985 ke bich rajya main raajnneetik asthirataa rahi
 President's rule also came into force
 lagaataar aandolan hote rahe or kai baar in andolanon ne hinsak rup akhriyaar kiya
 a state of unprecedented ethnic violence has arisen in the state
 lambe samay tak samjhauta-vaarta chalane ke baavjood andolan ke netaaon or centre sarkaar ke bich koi sahmati nahin ban saki, kyonki yah bahut hi jatil mudda tha
 It was not easy to decide who is 'outsider' or foreigner and where such people should be sent
 centre sarkaar ne 1983 main assam main vidhansabha chunaav karaane kaa faisalaa kiya
 But organizations associated with the movement boycotted it
 in chunaavon main bahut kam vot daale gayi
 In areas where the Assamese speaking people had a majority, there were less than three percent of the votes
 rajya main adivasee, bhashaai or sampradayik pahachaanon ke naam par jabardast hinsa hui jisamen teen hazaar se bhi zyaada log maare gayi
 The Congress Party government was formed after the elections, but it had no democratic legitimacy
 1983 kii hinsa ke baad donon pakshon main phir se samjhauta-vaarta shuru hui
 On 15 August 1985, an agreement was reached between the Rajiv Gandhi government at the center and the leaders of the movement, known as the Assam Accord
 iske tahat 1951 se 1961 ke bich aaye sabhi logon ko purna naagarikta or vot dene kaa adhikaar dene kaa faisalaa kiya gaya
 Decided that those who came to Assam after 1971 will be sent back
 196 1 se 1971 ke bich aane vaale logon ko vot kaa adhikaar nahin diya gaya, lekin unhen naagarikta ke anya sabhi adhikaar diye gayi
 a package for the economic development of Assam was also announced and it was decided to set up an oil refinery, paper mill and technology institute here
 centre sarkaar ne yah bhi faisalaa kiya ki vah asamiya-bhashi logon ke saanskrithik, saamaajik or bhashaai pahchaan kii suraksha ke liye vishesh kanoon or prashasnic upaay karegi
 Subsequently, the voter list was amended based on this agreement
 vidhansabha ko bhang karke 1985 main hi chunaav karaae gayi, jisamen navgathit assam gana parishad ko bahumat mila
 Party leader Prafulla Kumar Mahant, who was also the president of ASU, became the chief minister
 us samay unki umr keval 32 varsh kii thi
 The Assam Accord brought an end to the long-standing political instability there
 lekin 1985 ke baad bhi yahan ek alag bodo rajya ke liye andolan chalata rahaa
 Similarly, the active, underground and violent movement of ULFA continued with the demand of a separate nation for the Assamese people after separating from India
 assam andolan or assam samjhaute ke anubhav se pataa chalata he ki bahari logon ko gair-kanoonee rup se kahin basane se rokna to aavashyak he, lekin ek baar jo bas gaya use hataanaa ek bahut mushkil kaam he
 Apart from this, the granting of foreign status to people who have settled in the state for the last several generations only on the basis of their religious or linguistic identity encourages a kind of bigotry
 assam andolan ke dauraan bhi rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne ise musalamaanon ke kilaaf abhiyaan kaa rang dene kii koshish kii thi
 It is noteworthy that the issue on which the Assam movement started, the issue and the complaints related to it have not been completely resolved yet
 iske alaava assam ke samaaj main duusari pahachaanon ke prati ashishnutaa kii bhaavana badi he
 This has not only happened in the context of 'muslim Bengalis', but also a kind of bigotry has arisen against the demands of tribal people

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga upanishad hindu dharm ke mahatvapurn shruti dharmagranth hai
 These are integral parts of Vedic hymns
 inamen parameshwar, paramatma-brahm or aatma ke swabhaav or sambandh kaa bahut hi darshanik or gyanpurvak varnan diya gaya he
 In the Upanishads, knowledge was given importance by calling rituals 'inferior' because knowledge leads from gross to subtle
 brahm, jeev or jagat kaa gyaan paanaa upanishdon kii mul shiksha he
 Together with the Bhagavad Gita and the Brahmasutra Upanishads, they are called the 'departures' of Vedanta
 upanishad hi samast bhartiya darshanon ke mul strot hai, chaahe wo veydant ho yaa sankhya yaa jain dharm yaa buddha dharm
 The Upanishads themselves have also been called Vedanta
 duniya ke kai darshanik upanishdon ko sabase behtareen gyaanakosh maanate hai
 The Upanishads are an invaluable asset to the world of Indian civilization
 mukhya upanishad 12 yaa 13 hai
 Each is associated with some Veda
 ye sanskrit main likhe gayi hai
 In the 17th century, Dara Shikoh translated many Upanishads into Persian
 19veen sadi main german tatvaveta shopenhavar or maxmooler ne in granthon main jo ruchi dikhalaakar inke anuwaad kiye vah sarvavidit hai or mananeey hai
 The word Upanishad simply means 'close upavasana' or 'sitting close by'
 yah shabd ‘up’, ‘ni’ upsarg tathaa, ‘sad’ dhaatu se nishpann hua he
 Sad Dhatu has three meanings: the destruction of details; Movement or knowing and sediment-relaxation
 upanishad main rishi or shishy ke bich bahut sundar or good samvaad he jo pathak ko veda ke marm tak pahunchaata he
 The Upanishads are the foundation of Indian spiritual thought, the source of Indian spiritual philosophy
 ve brahmavidya hai
 There are answers discovered by the sages of curiosities
 ve chintansheel rishiyon kii gyancharchaaon kaa saar hai
 They are poetic metaphysical creations of poet-hearted sages, attempts to discover the unknown, attempts to tie the indescribable superpower into words, and are written accounts of that formless, formless, boundless, inexhaustible desire to understand and define the inscrutable 
 vaidic yug sansaarik anand evam upbhog kaa yug tha
 It was an era of the piety, purity, sentimentality, naivete and sinlessness of the human mind
 jivan ko sampurna allhadpan se jeena hi us kaal ke logon kaa prey va shrey tha
 Seeing the various beautiful forms of nature, the emotions that emerged in the passionate minds of the people of that time in the form of spontaneous illumination waves, he termed them as prashas, praises, divine songs and poetic works and became Vedic rites or mantras
 un logon ke man sansaarik anand se bhare the, sampannataa se santusht the, prakritik divyataaon se bhav-vibhor ho uthte the
 Therefore, the desire in his songs is that this joy should always remain, grow and never end
 unhone kaamana kii ki is anand ko ham purna aayu sau varshon tak bhogen or hamaare baad kii peedhiyaan bhi isi prakaar trupt rahen
 Not only this, it was also wished that at the end of this life we should go to heaven and the continuation of this happiness and bliss should remain there too
 is uddeshy kii prapti ke liye vibhinn anushthan bhi kiye gaye or devataaon ko prasann karne ke aayojan karke unase ye vardaan bhi maange gaye
 When nature took a turn, natural calamities were encountered
 tab un vipattiyon kekaalpanik niyantrak devataaon yatha marut, agni, rudra aadi ko tusht va prasann karne ke anushthan kiye jate the or unase prarthana kii jaati thi ki aisi vipattiyon ko aane na den or unke aane par praja kii raksha karen
 Overall, the lives of the people of the Vedic period were cheerful, eloquent, well-meaning, optimistic, and lively
 unamem vishaad, paap yaa kshtmay jivan ke vichaar kii chaaya nahin thi
 Hell and the tortures found in it were not even imagined
 karm ko yajna or yajna ko hi karm mana gaya tha or usee ke sabhi sukhon kii prapti tathaa sankaton kaa nivaaran ho jane kii avadharana thi
 This lifestyle lasted for a long time
 par aisa kab tak chalata
 One day or the other, this curiosity had to arise in the infinitely inquisitive mind of man and never satisfied with the present, who is the creator behind this huge amphitheater of nature, who is its creator / creator, its origin
 Where is it, who are we, where have we come from, where will this creation eventually go
 hamaara kya hoga? shanai:-shanai: ye prashn ankurit hue
 And then began the quest to find answers to all this and the endless search journey of the curious mind-brain
 aisa nahin he ki aatma, punarjanm or karmfalwaad ke vishay main vaidic rishiyon ne kabhi sochaa hi nahin tha
 It was not that he did not care about this life
 rishiyon ne yada-kada is vishay par vichaar kiya bhi tha
 Its seeds are found here and there in the Vedas, but this was just a thought
 koi chintaa yaa bhay nahin
 The soul is a different element than the body, and after the end of this life, it goes to the other world, this principle is definitely found in the Vedic hymns, but the Vedic sages did not appear in the search for why the soul travels in the world
 apni samast simaaon ke saath sansaarik jivan vaidic rishiyon kaa prey tha
 The fear of leaving Preya and moving towards the credit arose at the time of the Upanishads, then the life of life in front of salvation was destroyed and when people instead of enjoying life started turning away from it and taking sannyas
 haan, yah bhi hua ki vaidic rishi jahaan yah puch kar shant ho jate the ki 'yah sristi kisne banaai he?' or 'koun devtaa he jisaki ham upasna karen'? vahaan upanishdon ke rishiyon ne sristi banane vaale ke sambandh main kuch siddhanton kaa nishchay kar diya or us 'sat' kaa bhi pataa paa liya jo puja or upasna kaa vastut: adhikaar he
 Vedas and new narratives of Vedic religion are Upanishads
 'vedon main yajna-dharm kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya or logon ko yah sikh di gai ki is jivan main sukhi, sampann tathaa sarvatra safal va vijayi rahane ke liye aavashyak he ki devataaon kii tushti va prasannataa ke liye yajna kiye jaaen
 Yajna is the place of origin of the world
 sabhi karmon main shreshth karm yajna he
 Heaven is attained by the results of the yajna
 ' ye hi sutara chaaron ore gunjit the
 Secondly, when the Brahmin texts gave great importance to the yajna and the arbitrariness of the priests and the priests increased immensely, then there was a reaction against this system and the spirit of protest was initiated
 log sochane lage ki 'yagyon kaa vaastavik arth kya he?' 'unke bheetar koun sa rahasy he?' 've dharm ke kis rup ke pratik hai?' 'kya ve hamen jivan ke charam lakshya tak pahunchaa denge?' is prakaar, karmkand par bahut adhik jor tathaa karmkandon ko hi jivan kii sabhi samasyaon ke hal ke rup main pratipaadit kiye jane kii pravriti ne vichaarvaan logon ko unke bare main punarvichaar karne ko prerit kiya
 The Vedic Aryans became polytheists while imagining a controlling deity in every form of nature
 unke devataaon main ullekhneey hai- indra, varun, agni, savita, som, ashvinikumar, marut, pushan, mitra, pitar, yama aadi
 Then an intellectual anxiety began to see that one superpower or to understand its true nature, which is the creator of the entire creation and the authority over these gods
 is vyagrata ne upanishad ke chintanon kaa maarg prashast kiya
 The Upanishads are philosophical poetic compositions of contemplative and imaginative mystics
 jahaan gadhy likh gaye hai ve bhi padyamay gadhy-rachanaaon main aisi shabd-shakti, dhvanyaatmakataa, lav evam arthgarbhita he ki ve kisi daivi shakti kii rachanaaon kaa abhas dete hai
 It is not really an exaggeration that he was called 'mantra' or 'richa'
 vastav main mantra yaa richa kaa sambandh veda se he parantu upanishdon kii hamatta darshane ke liye in sangyaaon kaa upyog yahan bhi katipay vidwaanon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The Upanishads are an attempt to peek behind the visible world around them
 iske liye na koi upkaran uplabdh hai or na kisi prakaar kii prayog-anusandhan suvidhaayen sambhav he
 Spiritual pulsation or divine light based on your mindset, mental experience or insight is the basis of the description
 upanishad aadhyaatmavidya ke vividh adhyay hai jo vibhinn ant:prerit rishiyon dwaara likhe gaye hai
 These include various metaphors and symbols describing the nature of the world, its location, its relationship with various natural powers, the glimpse of a ray in the human soul or the presence of a subtle reflection, etc
 sristi ke udgam evam uski rachana ke sambandh main gahan chintan tathaa swayanfoort kalpana se upje roopankan ko vividh bimbon or pratikon ke madhyam se prastut karne kaa praytn kiya gaya he
 In the end it was said that this is what we can understand based on our best hypothesis
 iske aage is rahasy ko shaayad paramatma hi jaanata ho or 'shaayad vah bhi nahin jaanata ho
 ' sankshep main, vedon main is sansar main drishyman evam prakat prakritik shaktiyon ke swaroop ko samajhane, unhen apni kalpanaanusaar vibhinn devataaon kaa jama pahanaakar unki aradhana karne, unhen tusht karne tathaa unase sansaarik safalataa va sampannataa evam suraksha paane ke praytn kiye gaye the
 Yagyas were created to convey their reverence to them
 upanishdon main un anek prayatnon kaa vivaran he jo in prakritik shaktiyon ke peeche kii paramashkti yaa sristi kii sarvocch satta se saakshaatkaar karne kii manokamana ke saath kiye gaye
 He tried his best to reach as far as human imagination, thinking ability, insight ability could reach the philosophers, mystics or sages of that time
 yahi unka tap tha
 The Veda has four parts - Samhita, Brahmin, Aranyaka and Upanishads
 upanishad main aatm or anatm tattvon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he jo veda ke moulik rahasyon kaa pratipaadan karata he
 Often, the Upanishads come at the end of the Veda
 isliye ye veydant ke naam se bhi prakhyat hai
 The three major texts which authenticate the fundamental principles of Vedic religion, which are known by the name of Prasthanatrayi, are the Upanishads, Brahmasutra and Srimadbhagavadgita
 upanishad brahm vidya kaa dyotak he
 It is said that the practice of this knowledge destroys the ignorance of Mummukhujan; She makes Brahma attain; Due to which, the sorrows of human beings etc
, worldly sorrows are completely relaxed

 Hazards are classified by natural or man-made causes
 prakriyaaon kii pahchaan ke uddeshy se sampurna samrik prabandhan kii prakriya ko chaar kshetron main baanta gaya he
 These four areas are generally concerned with risk mitigation, preparing resources to counter the threat, responding to the actual damage caused by the hazard, and limiting further damage and returning to the situation as closely as possible to the event of the threat 
 kshetra saarvajanik or nijee donon main hota he, prakriya ek si sanjhi hoti he lekin dhyaan centre vibhinn hote hai
 The emergency management process is a strategic process rather than a policy process, so it is usually limited to the executive level in the organization
