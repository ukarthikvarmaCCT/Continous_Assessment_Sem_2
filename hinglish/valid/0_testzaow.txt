 Just as chromosomes have been studied in animals, they have also been studied in flora
 adhiktar beej vaale paudhe ubhayalingashrayi hote hai, arthath unamem nar tathaa maadaa ling ek saath hote hai
 Even when chromosomes are counted, gender is only discussed in the context of male-female analysis, because the problem of gender and heredity is not in the botanical world
 kuch jati main nar tathaa maadaa paudhe pruthak hote hai
 x and y chromosomes of such plants have also been detected, such as Ilodia canadensis, Milandrium album etc
 bijwala ek paudha, fregariya ilatior, chidiyon kii bhanti chromosome vaala batalaaya jaataa he
 In some other plants, the male bears two Ys and one x in spite of being heterosexual
 hraas vibhaajan ke samay donon vaai tathaa eks pruthak ho jate hai or do vaai janan koshika se milakar nar tathaa ek eks maadaa bhrun ke rup main parivartit ho jate hai
 Similarly, sex is also determined in other plants
 praaniyon ke sharir main kuch aisi granthiyaan hoti hai jinhen vahinihin yaa ant:sravi kaha jaataa he
 The secretions of these glands, called hormones, have been studied in some developed, especially vertebrate animals
 vanaspatiyon main bhi hormone hote hai yaa nahin, yah vivadagrast vishay he
 Names of glands found in the body of animals are: pituitary, pineal, thyroid gland, parathyroid, thymus, pacius or pancreas, kidney; Gonads, testes in males and ovaries in females
 in grathiyon se nikalne vaale hormonon kaa adhyayan vistaar se kiya gaya he or yah paaya gaya he ki nar praani main purushatv or maadaa main stritv sambandhit gaun langik lakshanon kaa astitv inhen kii kriya par nirbhar karata he
 Genes and chromosomes only determine whether the zygote will be male or female
 vaastavik purushatv or stritv kaa nirdhaaran tathaa uchit disha main unka vikaas vahinihin grathiyon ke sraavon kii sahaayta se hi hota he
 For example, if an embryo is born as a male, then by either dipping the female hormones or castrating it and implanting the ovary glands in its place, it will either become fully female, or develop symptoms of femininity
 
 xxrep 4 = Name - male-female kachua -- eks eks -- eks o Pigeon — x x, or z z — x o, or z w chamagadad -- eks o -- eks eks Rat - x y - x x choupaae -- eks o -- eks eks Sheep - x y - x x chimpaji -- eks vaai -- eks eks Shrimp, oil shank, grasshopper - x o, or x y - x x sanda -- eks eks -- eks o Rooster - x x, or z z - x o or z w khargosh -- eks vaai, yaa eks o -- eks eks Dog - x y - x x bhens -- eks vaai -- eks eks Horse - x y - x x bandar—eks vaai -- eks eks Drosophila - x y - x x vanaspatiyon tathaa jantuon kaa samuchit adhyayan karne par yah paaya gaya he ki ling kaa nirdhaaran nar or maadaa pravritiyon kaa hi ekmaatr parinaam nahin hota
 Male and female determinants are equally developed along with fetal development
 koi praani nar yaa maadaa keval isliye nahin ho jaataa ki uski rachana vishesh sankhya vaale chromosomon dwaara hui hoti he, apitu vah nar yaa maadaa isliye bhi ho jaataa he ki usne maadaa yaa nar nirdharak anya tatwon ko "dabaa" diya
 All hormones are produced in the body, so when the hormones that determine the femininity, or masculinity, are more powerful, then the fetus will move towards the female, or male body and tendencies
 hormonon ke santulan kaa hi yah parinaam hota he ki praani nar yaa maadaa ke rup main janm letaa he
 Kurt Stern has shown that if a woman has three x in place of two X, then she will have more femininity
 kintu aisi stri der main rituvati, atyadhik alpaayu or sarvatha vandhya hogi
 Similarly, Goldschmidt studies a moth named Limatria japonica, stating that 50% of normal males and 50% of endemic females are produced when strong males are conjugated to weak insects
 kintu jab atyadhik shashakt naron kaa nirbal maadaaon se sanyog hota he tab 100% nar keet utpann hote hai

 Cryu also states that the sex of a fetus is determined not only by chromosomes, but also by the interactions of the genes found in them and the genes found in the alingots, such as birds having female heterosexual XY and male homosexual XX
 
 kiton main langik vibhaajan janan grathiyon par nirbhar nahin karata
 Their main demographic characteristics are: male x O, or x Y; Female x x
 phincolor ne san 1923 main kuch nar kiton ke mastak katkar maadaaon par tathaa maadaaon ke mastak naron par laga die
 In these experiments it was found that the insects acted not according to their body but according to the forehead, ie females with male cephalices exhibited sexual traits like males and female cephalic males
 bahut se jantuon ke nar or maadaa ke aakaar evam swaroop main spasht antar hota he
 This is called sexual dimorphism
 yah batalaaya ja chukaa he ki langik vikaas ke tritiy charan main nar maadaa ke bhed prakat hone lag gaye the
 Gradually the ovaries and testes developed and the supporting organs also developed gradually

 As soon as we move towards the higher class, it will be found that the sexes are clearly separated and the composition of male and female body is also different
 langik dvirupata kaa parichit udhaaharan bonelia viridis naamak ek samudri krimi he
 Its female is green and plum-like in shape
 samudr ke tal main pattharon ke neeche yaa unke chhidron main, yah krimi nivas karata he
 While waving his bifurcated shund out there, this creature keeps looking for food
 nar krimi atyant sookshm hota he or jananaangon ke atirikt iske anya sabhi angon kaa hraas ho gaya hota he
 The male worm remains like a philanthropist inside the female's body
 nishechit andashay viksit hokar jal main swatantra rup se tairte hue larva kii bhanti hote hai
 If a larva sits on the seabed, or is unable to reach a female's trough, it develops into a female
 kintu yadi kisi prakaar vah maadaa ke shund main aakarshit hokar pahunch jaataa he, to vah nar ke rup main viksit hota he
 The dwarf male, captive in the female's furrow, fertilizes the ovum, reaching it into the female's reproductive tube by sliding it into the mouth and slowly sliding down from there
 nishechit andashay pun: jal main tyaag die jate hai or swatantra rup se larva kii bhanti tairne lag jate hai
 Similarly, a parasitic crustacea called Sacculina remains dependent on male and female crabs
 giyard tathaa smith ne likhaa he ki is crusteshia kaa sharir kekade ke udar main palata he or kuch bhaag sharir bhedakar baahar bhi nikal aata he
 The crab whose body it penetrates in, suckles its genitals
 iske kaaran vah vandhya ho jaataa he
 Most crabs die, some males become female with female traits, or female crabs become intracellular and produce both testes and ovaries
 ling sahalagnta kaa arth he, langik chromosomon main paae janevaale jeenon ke anusaar lingon main vibhinnata
 The traits or traits that depend on these genes are called gender linkages
 in gunon yaa visheshkon kii pareshan vidhi ko ling sahalgn vanshagati kehete hai, jaise purush main eks vaai tathaa stri main eks eks chromosome hote hai
 If a man is contaminated with a genetic defect, only his sons can inherit that defect, not daughters
 sarvapratham doncaster ne san 1908 main is vishay par prakaash daalaa tha
 He coincided with the female of a moth Abraxas lacticlar to the male of Abraxas grossulariata
 parinamswaroop pratham peedi main sabhi shalab grossulariata varg ke keet paae gaye
 In the second generation, the ratio of Grossulariata and Lacticlar was 3: 1, but all Lacticlar females were found to be female
 isse pataa chalaa ki is praani main nar ek prakaar ke yugmak utpann karata he, kintu maadaa do prakaar ke
 Hence male is homozygous and female is heterozygous
 bravell kehete hai ki eks chromosome main kuch anya prakaar ke anuvanshik kaarak tathaa jin hote hai
 If this theory is correct, then the parents of Samyuktmji parents will move to their heterozygous offspring
 is siddhant ko ling sahalagnta kaha jaataa he, jaise falmakkhi droesophila kii maadaa main do eks tathaa nar main eks vaai chromosome paae jate hai
 Its x chromosomes will have genes from red eyes, or white eyes
 laal aankh vaale jeenon ko prabhavi tathaa shwet ko aprabhavi kehete hai
 Therefore, when white and red-eyed flies conjugate, there are more children with red eyes
 ling sahalgni rogon main haemophilia tathaa rangandhta pramukh rog maane jate hai
 The sperm and egg combine to form a zygote
 khandi bhawan kii prakriya main ek hi nishechit dimb anek khandon main tab tak vibhajit hota rahata he, jab tak vah purna bhrun nahin ban jaataa
 In this process, the chromosomes of the sperm and the chromosomes of the egg continue to split together
 udhaaharan ke liye, purush ke 23 tathaa stri ke 23 chromosome milakar 46 chromosome ho jate he
 At the time of division 23 chromosomes move towards one end and 23 on the other side
 in donon chhoron ko putreekoshika cendrak bhi kehete hai
 Many types of defects can occur in this normal process of division such as 22 chromosomes are left in one center and 24 in the other, or if any other accident happens, it will be called aviation
 is siddhant ke saath brijez kaa naam liya jaataa he
 He studied some mutant creatures in 1916
 inhone paaya ki eks eks eks tathaa eks eks vaai vaale donon praani maadaa the, ekso vaala praani nar, kintu santanotpaadan main aksham tha or ovai vaala praani badha hi nahin
 a creature which had less than one X, it was primary and one which had more X, it was called secondary undeployed

 Scientists believe that the life of a male creature begins in the form of a female, in which x is present
 jab koshika vibhaajan pranrabh hota he
 At that time, the number of chromosomes in one part of the dividing cell increases
 falswaroop ek vibhajit koshika main keval ek vaai hi aa paata he
 Due to the uneven number of chromosomes of this type, the male and female shapes vary
 aise stri-purush vaale praaniyon kii aantarik rachana ke pareekshanon se pataa chalata he ki unke shukranu tathaa dimb jananaang bhi upasthit rahete hai
 This abnormality is found in excess in those in which the effect of hormono is minimal, or not at all
 yahi kaaran he ki kuch pakshiyon ko chhodkar stripurupata anya viksit tathaa ucch praaniyon main nahin pai jaati
 Hermaphroditism - almost all organisms in the world are hermaphroditic
 purushatv tathaa stritv kii disha main kisi praani kaa vikaas kis aadhaar par hota he, is sambandh main sabhi vaigyanik ek mat nahin hai
 Why there is a difference in the number of chromosomes at the time of cell division, or why one of the Wolfie and Miliary vessels is depleted at the time of sex, or by a rule, or quantity, of the masculinity or femininity, why and how Are secreted? Scientists have not been able to give any satisfactory answer to all these questions yet
 at: ham yah maan lenge ki stri yaa purush hona nire sanyog kii baat he
 Each creature has the ability to develop into a male, or female
 ubhalingta iskaa jwalanth udhaaharan he
 There are many types of hermaphroditic, such as animals that self-fertilize, such as hydra, laceworm, flatworm, etc
 There are other animals that depend on each other for fertilization; Such as earthworms, leeches, etc

 Medievalism - This is the situation when a creature is developing towards one sex and suddenly, due to some reason, also takes on the other sex
 manushyon main hijadon kii yahi avasthaa hoti he
 According to genetic science, the reason for such a condition is the presence of three X, or two x chromosomes with a somatic chromosome group
 
 Due to this ratio, the outer shape of flies is a mixture of male and female, although male and female tissues are not found in their body due to reproduction
 ve akruti main yaa to nar hi hongi, yaa maadaa hi
 Such creatures are Vandhyas

 In 1923, Kriu examined some domestic animals and found that they had false median sex, that is, some had very narrow female genitals, some were straight and clear, but unexpectedly long, and some were clearly similar to males, but Was incomplete nullayukta
 kuch main vrushan tathaa dimb granthiyaan bhi upasthit thim
 Some men have been found to have menstruation and some have been weaned

 Many creatures have automatic gender changes, their life cycle is like this: male and bisexual and female
 bonelia, paraseete kekadon, ghoghon, madhumakhiyon, taraminon tathaa pakshiyon main lagic parivartan praaia: hote rahete hai
 Almost all scientists have studied sex change in chickens and found that a rooster was initially female and laid eggs, but ovulation stopped due to ovarian disease
 murgi main dhire dhire murga ke lakshan prakat hone lage or vah murgiyon main garbhaadhan karne lagi
 Kryu states that females have a normal ovum, as well as a small, undeveloped testicle
 dimbashay ke niskriy hote hi vrushan sakriy ho jaataa he
 The same situation occurred for chickens whose ovaries were cut and removed
 choupayon ke judawon main swatantra martin naam se ek asaamaanya ghatana kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 This is an example of the hormone effect
 judawein teen prakaar ke hote hai : donon nar yaa donon maadaa, yaa ek nar or ek maadaa
 In the last type, there is a possibility that in embryonic development, the flow of blood from one body to another body in both the fetuses continues
 aisi dasha main hormonon kaa bhi aadan pradaan chal saktaa he
 The male hormone first develops and leads the twins to masculinity
 maadaa hormone der main viksit hota he or judawon main se ek ko moulik rup se maadaa banaata he
 The female that will be born as a result will have obvious characteristics of male and will be a vagina
 lily ne yah batalaaya he ki choupayon ke judawon main saamaanya raktapravaah hota he or maadaa ko vastav main nar hormonoyukt rakt praapt hota he
 The twins in other animals do not have normal blood flow, so they do not have independent martins
 langik parivartan kaa prabhaav manushyon par bhi dekha jaataa he
 It is often read in newspapers that such a gender change occurred
 san 1935 tathaa 36 ke olympic chapiyanon main do striyaan aisi pai gai jo baad main chalakar purush ho gai
 Before the onset of puberty in humans, if the gonads of a woman and man are cut off, then their sex will be changed, but they will not be fully female, or male, and neither will be able to reproduce
 unke haav-bhav avashya striyochit, yaa purushochit ho jaayenge
 In birds, sex conversion takes place from femininity to masculinity
 is kaa arth he kisi praani varg main nar tathaa maadaa kii utpatti, sthiti tathaa mrityu kii dar
 It is estimated that at least the first child in humans is male
 yuddh ke dinon main bhi adhikansh santaanen nar hoti hai, kyonki prakruti swayan purushon kii kami ko puraa karti he
 The primary sex ratio applies not only to humans, but also to the animal world

 If the chickens are forced to produce children, then the female children will be born more
 gaun linganupaat ke sambandh main kriu ne kuch niyam batalaaye hai : The proportion of animals varies with species, such as the proportion of 100 females to males 103–107, horse 98
6, dog 118
5, quadruped 107
3, sheep 97
7, pig 111

 The relationship with these revolutionary leaders and the actions of the revolutionary party could not be hidden from the eyes of the police
 africa se bhai ji landan chale gaye
 There those days Shri Shyamji Krishna Verma and Vinayak Damodar Savarkar were active in revolutionary works
 bhai ji in donon ke sampark main aaye
 Bhai ji returned to India in 1907
 dayanand vaidic mahavidhyalay main padhaane ke saath-saath ve yuvakon ko kranti ke liye prerit karne ke kaary main sakriy rahe
 He had close contact with Sardar Ajit Singh and Lala Lajpat Rai
 isi dauraan lahore police unke peeche pad gayi
 In 1910, Bhai ji was arrested in Lahore
 kintu sheeghra hi unhen jamaanat par reeha kar diya gaya
 After this, brother went to America
 vahaan unhone pravasi bharatiyon main vaidic dharm kaa prachaar kiya
 There, you met your famous revolutionary Lala Hardayal in Martanak colony
 bharat main kranti karaane ke liye pramukh kaaryakartaaon ke dal ko yahan sanghatit kiya ja rahaa tha
 You also joined this team with the inspiration of Lala Hardayal
 kartaar singh saraaba, vishnu ganesh pingale tathaa anya yuvakon ne unki prerana se apana jivan bharat kii swadhinata ke liye samarpit karne kaa sankalp liya
 Returning to India in 1913, Bhai ji again became active in the work of inspiring the youth in Lahore
 bhai parmanand ne dakshin america ke kai british upniveshon kaa daura kiya or lala hardayal se saan francisco main punah mili
 He was also one of the founders of the Ghadar Party

 The book "tawarikhe-hind" written by Bhai ji and his writings used to inspire the youth for armed revolution
 bharat main kranti karne ke uddeshy se ve bharat laut aaye
 He claimed that five thousand revolutionaries had come to India with him
 gadar kranti ke netaaon main ve bhi the
 He was given the responsibility to lead the revolution in Peshawar
 25 farvari 1915 ko lahore main gadar party ke anya sadasyon ke saath bhai ji ko bhi giraftaar kar liya gaya
 He was sentenced to death by conspiring against the British power in America and England, motivating Kartar Singh Saraba and many other youths for armed revolution, writing offensive literature
 sajaa kaa samachar milte hi deshbhar ke log udign ho uthe
 Finally, the sentence of death sentence of Bhai ji was canceled and he was sent to Andaman in December, 1915 after being sentenced to life imprisonment
 udhar bhai ji jail main amanviya yatnaayen sahan kar rahe the, idhar unki dharmapatni shrimati bhagyasudhi dhanabhav ke baavjood purna swabhimaan or saahas ke saath apane parivaar kaa paalan-poshan kar rahi thim

 He also demanded the release of Bhai Ji
 20 april 1920 ko bhai ji ko kalapani jail se mukt kar diya gaya
 The inhuman torture that Bhai Ji endured in five years in the black dungeon, makes him cry by reading his description in the book "meri Apabiti" written by Bhai Ji
 pro dharmaveer dwaara likhit "krantikari bhai parmanand" granth main bhi in yaatnaaon kaa romaanchakaari varnan diya gaya he
 Freed from jail, Bhai Ji again made Lahore his area of work

 Bhai ji also inspired him to offer sacrifices in the yagya of armed revolution
 bhai ji ne "vir bandaa vairaagi" pustak kii rachana kii, jo puure desh main charchit rahi
 When the Congress and Gandhiji adopted the fatal policy of Muslim appeasement, Bhai ji strongly opposed it
 yahi kaaran he ki ve congress ke aandolanon se dur rahe
 He used to emphasize the importance of Hindu organization everywhere
 bhai ji ne "hindu" patr kaa prakaashan kar desh ko khandit karne ke shadyantron ko ujagar kiya
 Bhai ji had predicted in 1930 itself that the ultimate aim of Muslim leaders is to divide the motherland and create Pakistan
 bhai ji ne yah bhi chetavanee di thi ki congressi netaaon par vishwaas na karo, ye kisi din vishwasghaat kar desh kaa vibhaajan karaayenge

 In 744 the Basmils captured the Goetkurk capital Otugen and King Ozmish Khan
 lekin usee saal uiguron or karluqon ne aapasi santhganth kar lee or milakar basamilon par hamalaa kar diya
 The head of the king of the Basmills was annihilated and the entire tribes were either enslaved or distributed to other tribes or sold to the Chinese

 It is said that the Chinese ambassador then instigated Tengri Bogu's uncle Tun Baga Tarkhan for the rebellion
 usne tengri bogu ko maar daalaa or uske parivarajan or soudai salaahkaaron samet 2,000 logon ko maut ke ghaat utaar diya
 Tun Baga Tarkhan became the new Khan
 usne phir se uttar ke kirghizon par hamale kar ke unhen adheenta swikaarne par majaboor kar diya
 Tun Baga Tarkhan died in 789 and after that the Uyghur Khaganat began to weaken

 Two or three Khaganans came, they saved the empire from ending

 He repulsed the Tibetan attack in 821 and settled trade routes to Sogda

 The Kyrgyzans attacked from the north and burnt the Uygur capital

 Later Muslim historians called the Uygur Khaganat in Turkey the name of 'tokuz Oguz', which means 'nine clan'
 chini strot bhi 'jiu shing' bulaate the jiskaa matlab 'nau naam' he
 It may be a reference to the original nine tribes of Tiale
 lekin yah bhi sambhav he ki 'toquz oguz' sirf tiele yaa uigur hi nahin balki sabhi turkon ke liye ek naam rahaa ho

 shuruaati daur main efil tower ko 20 saal kii avadhi ke liye banaaya gaya tha jise 1909 main nasht karnaa tha
 But during these 20 years, the Eiffel Tower still stands as the pride of Paris due to its usefulness in scientific and technological fields

 yah lekh pashchaatvarti tathaa kam gyaat 'gupt rajvansh' ke bare main he
 For more famous Gupta dynasty, see - Gupta Dynasty samraat adityasena ke apasad evam samraat jivit gupt ke devvarnark ke lekhon se ek anya gupt rajvansh kaa pataa lagata he jo guptavansh ke patan ke pashchaat malwa or magadh main shaasha bana
 The founder of this dynasty was Krishnagupta
 inke kram main sriharshgupt, jivitagupta, kumargupta, damodargupta, mahasengupt, madhavagupt, adityasena, vishnugupt evam jivitagupta is vansh ke shaasha hue
 What this dynasty had to do with the erstwhile Guptas is not certain
 purvakalik gupton se pruthak karne kii drushti se inhen madhavagupt yaa uttarkalin gupt kehete hai
 The origin of this new Gupta dynasty is also disputed
 harshacharit main kumargupta or madhavagupt ko ‘maalav raajputr’ kaha he
 Mahasena Gupta was also supposedly the ruler of Malwa
 adityasena ke purvavarti kisi raja kaa koi lekh magadh pradesh se nahin mila
 Based on the above facts, some scholars have determined the origin of the lineage of Krishnagupta Malwa
 isi aadhaar par inhen malvagupt kehete the
 But most scholars consider them to be the original inhabitants of Magadha
 is vansh ke aarambhik naresh sambhavat: gupt samraaton ke adhinsth samant the
 In the inscription, Krishnagupta is called Nripe and synonymous nouns have also been used for the later rulers of this dynasty
 apane vansh kii swatantra satta sarvapratham is vansh ke kis shaasha ne sthapit kii, yah agyaat he
 The abridged article for Krishnagupta states that he was aristocratic
 unki bhujaaon ne shatruon ke haathiyon kaa shiroched singh kii tarah kiya tathaa apane asankhya shatruon par vijayi hue
 It was probably during Krishnagupta's time that Harivarman founded Maukharivansh in Kannauj
 krushangupta ne sambhavat: apni putree harshgupta kaa vivaah hariwarm ke putr adityavarman se kiya
 Shri Harshagupta, son and successor of Krishnagupta showed his valor in many terrible wars and got victory
 inke uttaradhikari jivitagupta ko apasad lekh main ‘kshitish-chudamani’ kaha gaya he
 People viewed his superhuman work with astonishment
 magadhagupton ke uttarkalin samraaton ke vishay main is prakaar kii koi baat gyaat nahin hoti
 Perhaps Madhavagupta was not even more important from the political point of view, this is why his traditional praise has been given in the articles
 kumargupta ke vishay main paryaapt evam nishchit jaankaree praapt hoti he
 It may have been during his time that the Magadhagupta declared his independent power
 kumargupta ne maukhari naresh ishanvarman ko parajeet kiya
 His success was permanent
 prayag tak kaa pradesh unke adhikaar main tha
 He practiced in Prayag
 unke putr damodargupta ne pun: maukhariyon ko yuddh main parajeet kiya, kintu ve swayan yudhakshetra main veergati ko praapt hue
 During this period, the Magadh daughter also established her authority over Malwa
 damodargupta ke uparaant unke putr mahasengupt shaasha hue
 He married his sister Mahasengupta to Adityavardhan, the son of Rajeshvardhan, the king of Thaneshwar, in order to consolidate his power against the Maukharis
 harshcharit main ullikhit kumargupta evam madhavagupt ke pita malvaraj sambhavat: mahasengupt hi the
 According to the Abroad article, they invaded the region from Lohitya and it is not impossible that they ruled the entire region from Malwa to Bengal for at least some time
 mahasengupt ne magadh gupton kii sthiti ko drudh kiya, kintu sheeghra hi kalchurinaresh shankaragan ne ujjayini par 595 i
 yaa iske kuch pehle adhikaar kar liya
 On the other hand, Mahalak Naresh Sheeladitya of Valabhi also established authority over the Western Malav region
 isi bich kisi samay sambhavat: mahasengupt ke samant shaasha shashaank ne apane ko uttar evam pashchim bengal main swatantra ghoshit kar diya
 Probably Magadha also came out under the authority of Mahasena Gupta
 mahasengupt kaa apana ant aisi sthiti main kyonkar hua, gyaat nahin hota
 But his two sons Kumaragupta and Madhavagupta took refuge in the court of Emperor Prabhakarvardhan at Thaneshwar
 is arajak sthiti main kinhin devgupt ne swayan ko malwa yaa uske kisi pradesh kaa shaasha ghoshit kar diya
 Whether or not this Devagupta had any connection with the Magadha Guptas cannot be said
 harshavardhan ke abhilekhon ke anusaar rajyavardhan ne devgupt kii badhati hui shakti ko niruddh kiya tha
 According to Harshacharit, with the help of Gowdadhip Shashank, Devgupta defeated the Maukhari king and killed him and took Rajyashree captive
 rajyavardhan ne devgupt ko parajeet kiya
 But Devgupta etc
 killed him by conspiracy
 kintu iske baad devgupt bhi parajeet ho gaye or kramash: harshavardhan ne praaia: sampurna uttar bharat main apni satta sthapit kar lee
 The abridged article appears to indicate that Madhavagupta ruled Magadha and often spent his whole life in joy and goodwill
 harsh ne bhi sambhavat: madhavagupt ko purvasambandhi evam mitra hone ke naate magadh kaa praantapati niyukt kiya hoga
 Madhavagupta would have declared his independence only after Harsha's death
 apasad lekh main madhavagupt ko vir, yashasvi or anek shatruon ko parajeet karanevaala kaha gaya he
 His kingdom would have started soon after the death of Harsha and its end may also have come soon
 madhavagupt ke pashchaat unke putr adityasena magadh ke shaasha hue
 Many articles of his time have been received
 unki saarvbhaum sthiti kii parichayika unki ‘maharajaadhiraj’ oopaadhi he
 An article from Deoghar mentions Adityasen's conquest of Chola region and various yagyas performed by him
 unhone teen ashwamedh bhi kiye
 Some other public welfare works of his period are known from the articles
 adityasena ne apni putree kaa vivaah maukhari naresh bhogavarman se kiya or unki pautri, bhogavarman kii putree, vatsadevi kaa vivaah nepal ke raja shivdev ke saath hua
 In some articles in Nepal, Adityasen has been mentioned by mentioning 'magadhhipasya Mahta: Sri Adityasenaraya'
 isse lagata he ki purvi bharat main magadhagupton kaa bada sanman evam dabadabaa tha
 The kingdom of Adityasen came to an end shortly after 672 AD

 Around 680 AD, the Chalukya king Vinayaditya of Vatapi defeated Devagupta
 inhone ‘maharajaadhiraj’ oopaadhi dhaaran kii
 It is clear from the article Devanaravan that after Devagupta his son Vishnugupta became the ruler of Magadha
 maharajaadhiraj oopaadhi inke liye bhi prayukt he
 He must have ruled for at least 17 years because the 17th year of his kingdom is mentioned in one of his articles

 The status of their Vijayaskandhavar is mentioned on the banks of the river Gomti
 isse anumaan hota he ki inhone gomti ke tirastha kisi pradesh par maukhariyon ke viruddh akraman kiya tha
 After Jeevagupta, no ruler of this dynasty is known
 magadh gupton kaa ant bhi agyaat he
 It is known from the Godwho that Yashovarman, the ruler of Kannauj, defeated and killed the ruler of Gaud in the middle of the 8th century
 parajeet gaudadhip ko magadh kaa shaasha bhi kaha he isaliye anumaan he ki yashovarman dwaara parajeet raja sambhavat: jivitagupta hi the
 It is not impossible that the Gaud King defeated Jeevagupta and seized Magadha from him and killed himself in the war against Yashovarman in the situation of Gaur and Magadha

 Seismic codes are building codes that are designed to reduce the loss of life and buildings due to earthquakes

 Landscapes generated during earthquakes create force and deformation in buildings

 Seismic codes help to improve the behavior of buildings so that they are able to withstand the effects of earthquakes and do not cause much loss of life and property

 Highly developed seismic codes have been produced in countries with a history of earthquakes

 However, the key to ensuring seismic safety lies in a robust system that can follow and implement these design code provisions in actual constructions
 bukampi code kisi kshetra vishesh yaa desh ke liye usee ke anuroop hote hai
 They take into account local seismology, acceptable levels of hazard, building designs and materials and methods used in construction

 The first formal seismic code named IS 1893 was published in India in 1962

 maanav ke dukhon kii nivruti ke liye or / yaa tatv saakshaatkaar karaane ke liye hi bharat main darshan kaa janm hua he
 The knot of the heart opens only and mourning and doubt are overcome only when one sees the truth
 manu kaa kathan he ki samyak darshan praapt hone par karm manushya ko bandhan main nahin daal saktaa tathaa jinako samyak drushti nahin he ve hi sansar ke mahamoh or jaal main funs jate hai
 Indian sages have tried to understand the mystery of the world from many angles
 bhartiya darshanikon ke bare main tii es aliot ne kaha tha- How and under what circumstances Indian philosophy came into existence, nothing can be said authentically
 kintu itnaa spasht he ki upanishad kaal main darshan ek pruthak shaastra ke rup main viksit hone laga tha
 The tendency to explore the elements is in India from that remote period, which we call as 'vedic Age'
 rugveda ke atyant pracheen yug se hi bhartiya vichaaron main dwividh pravriti or dwividh lakshya ke darshan hamen hote hai
 The first trend is genius or intelligent and the second trend is rational
 pragna ke bal se hi pehali pravriti tattvon ke vivechan main kritkaarya hoti he or duusari pravriti tark ke sahare tattvon ke samikshan main samarth hoti he
 In English words, we can say the first 'intuitionistic' and the second one is rationalistic
 lakshya bhi armbh se hi do prakaar ke the-dhan kaa uparjan tathaa brahm kaa saakshaatkaar
 The synergistic and rational-minded tendencies led to the emergence of the soul's formal philosophy
 upanishdon ke gyaan kaa paryavsaan aatma or paramatma ke ekikaran ko siddh karne vaale pratibhamulak veydant main hua
 The flow of karma, wisdom and devotional Tripathga that emerged from the fertile brain of Indian mystics, has contributed to the development of humanity by washing away the spiritual culmination of distant human beings by making them pure, continual-pure Buddha and ever-clean
 isi patitapavani dhara ko log darshan ke naam se pukaarte hai
 Inventors think that the first use of the word in its present sense was in Vaiseshika philosophy
 'darshan' shabd panineey vyakaran ke anusaar 'drishir prekshane' dhaatu se lut pratyay karne se nishpann hota he
 Therefore, the word darshan would mean 'to see or be seen' or 'to be seen'
 darshan shabd kaa shabdaarth keval dekhnaa yaa saamaanya dekhnaa hi nahin he
 That is why Panini has used the word 'observation' in Dhatworth
 prakrusht ikshan, jisamen antashvakshuon dwaara dekhnaa yaa manan karke sopapattik nishkarsh nikaalnaa hi darshan kaa abhidhey he
 Darshan is the name of both the means and the fruits of such excellent eating
 jahaan par in siddhanton kaa sankalan ho, un granthon kaa bhi naam darshan hi hoga, jaise-nyaay darshan, vaisheshik darshan, mimasaa darshan aadi-aadi
 Philosophies are also called philosophy
 yah shaastra shabd ‘shasu anushishtau’ se nishpann he
 The teaching of darshan is more useful for the creation and refinement of personal life
 bina darshanon ke aadhyatmik pavitrataa evam unnayan hona durlabh he
 Philosophy is able to guide us by providing light and light in the darkness with the help of proof and logic
 gita ke anusaar king karm kimakarmeti kavyopyatra mohitah param lakshya evam purusharth kii prapti darshanik gyaan se hi sambhav he, anyathaa nahin
 By philosophy we can summarize the subjects into two classes
 loukik or alokik athwa bhautik or aadhyatmik
 Darshan discusses us either about the principle of the elaborate universe, or about the soul
 is prakaar darshan ke vishay jad or chetan donon hi hai
 Since the ancient Rig Vedic period, there are some hints in our literature about the basic elements of philosophy
 neeche pramukh darshanashastron ke pratham sutara diye gayi hai jo mote taur par us darshan kii vishaywastu kaa parichay dete hai- The base elements which were seen scattered in the seed form in the Vedas emerged in the Brahmins; But there, he could not grow much by getting stuck in the copies of the vines of ritual
 aaranyakon main ye ankurit hokar upanishdon main khub pallavit hue
 The development of the philosophies which are visible to us in the Upanishads, the critics have fixed it in about two hundred years BC
 mahatma buddha se yah pracheen hai
 Not only this, scholars have also considered Sankhya, Yoga and Mimamsa as ancient to Buddha
 sambhav he ki ye darshan vartmaan rup main us samay na hon, tathaapi ve kisi rup main avashya vidyaman the
 Vaiseshika Darshan is also probably older than Buddha; Because just as in today's era, justice and Vaiseshika are considered similar systems, similarly earlier meat and Vaiseshika were considered
 buddhadarshan paddati kaa aavirbhaav isa se purv do sau varsh mana jaataa he, parantu jain darshan, buddha darshan se bhi pracheen thahartaa he
 In this confirmation, it is given proof that neither the Buddhist philosophy nor the Hindu philosophy is available in ancient Jain philosophies
 mahavir swami, jo jain sampradaay ke pravartak maane jate hai, ve bhi buddha se pracheen the
 Therefore, it is a reasonable idea for Jain philosophy to be ancient from Buddha philosophy
 bhartiya darshanon kaa aitihaasik kram nishchit karnaa kathin he
 All these different philosophies have evolved and developed almost simultaneously
 idhar-udhar tathaa bich main bhi kai kadiyaan chhin-bhinn ho gai hai
 Therefore, whatever is left, you have to take the basis of that
 is kram main shuddh aitihaasikta na hone par bhi kramik vikaas kii shrinkhalaa aadi se ant tak chalati rahi he
 Therefore, often scholars have followed this sequence
 bhartiya darshan kaa aarambh vedon se hota he
 "vedas" are the basic sources of all of Indian religion, philosophy, culture, literature etc
 aaj bhi dharmik or saanskrithik krityon ke avasar par veda-mantron kaa gayan hota he
 Many philosophical sects consider Vedas as their basis and proof
 aadhunik arth main vedon ko ham darshan ke granth nahin kah sakate
 He is a compilation of musical poems of ancient Indians
 unamem us samay ke bhartiya jivan ke anek vishyon kaa samavesh he
 Many types of philosophical ideas are also found in these songs of Vedas
 chintan ke inhen bijon se uttarkalin darshanon kii vanarajiyaan viksit hui hai
 Most of the Indian philosophies consider the Vedas to be their tributaries
 ye "aastik darshan" kehalaate hai
 Famous conspiracies are under these
 jo darshansampradaay apane ko vaidic parampara se swatantra maanate hai ve bhi kuch seemaa tak vaidic vichaardhaaraon se prabhavit hai
 The creation of the Vedas is very controversial
 praaia: pashchimi vidwaanon ne rugveda kaa rachanakaal 1500 i
pus
 se lekar 2500 i
pus
 tak mana he
 In contrast to the time of the Rigveda, 3000 BC by the evidence of Indian scholar astrology etc
 From 75000 BC Believe it
 itihaas kii vidit gatiyon ke aadhaar par in pracheen rachanaaon ke samay kaa anumaan karnaa kathin he
 It would have taken thousands of years to develop such a huge and rich literature in ancient times, no doubt
 uplabdh vaidic sahitya sampurna vaidic sahitya kaa ek chota sa ansh he
 All the literature composed in the ancient era could not have been compiled and a lot of the collected literature would have been destroyed by the invaders
 vaastavik vaidic sahitya kaa vistaar itnaa adhik tha ki uske rachanakaal kii kalpana karnaa kathin he
 Undoubtedly he must have been very ancient
 vedon ke sambandh main yah spasht karnaa aavashyak he ki quran or bible kii bhanti "veda" kisi ek granth kaa naam nahin he or na ve kisi ek manushya kii rachanaayen hai
 "vedas" is a complete literature which has a huge tradition and contains many texts
 dharmik parampara main vedon ko nity, apaurushey or ishwariya mana jaataa he
 From the historical point of view, we can consider them the creation of sages
 vedamantron ke rachnewale rishi anek hai
 Vedic literature has developed in four stages
 ye samhita, brahman, aaranyak or upanishad kehalaate hai
 The collection of mantras and hymns is called "samhita"
 rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda mantron kii samhitaayein hi hai
 They also have many branches
 in samhitaon ke mantra yajna ke avasar par devataaon kii stuti ke liye gaae jate the
 Even today, they are sung on the occasion of religious and cultural acts
 in vedamantron main indra, agni, varun, surya, som, ushaa aadi devataaon kii sangitamay stutiyaan surakshit hai
 Yajna and Devopasana were the basic forms of Vedic religion
 vedon kii bhaavana uttarkalin darshanon ke samaan sanyasapradhan nahin he
 In the Vedantras, faith in life and the euphoria of life is steeped
 jagat kii asatyata kaa vedamantron main abhas nahin he
 The Rigveda has adequate values of temporal values
 vaidic rishi devataaon se ann, dhan, santan, swasthya, dderghaayu, vijay aadi kii abhyarthna karte hai
 The mantras of the Vedas are excellent examples of the musical folklore of ancient Indians
 brahman, aaranyak or upanishad granthon main gadhy kii pradhanta he, yadhyapi unka yah gadhy bhi layayukt he
 In the Brahmin texts, the method of yajnas, their purpose, fruits etc
 is discussed
 aaranyakagranthon main aadhyatmikta kii ore jhukaav dikhaai detaa he
 As it is known by this name, these are texts of the use of vanaprasthas
 upanishdon main aadhyatmik chintan kii pradhanta he
 The Brahmins, Aranyakas and Upanishads of the four mantras of the Vedas meet separately
 shatapath, tandeya aadi brahman prasiddh or mahatvapurn hai
 Both Aranyak and Upanishads are found in the name of Aitareya, Taittiriya etc
 inke atirikt ish, ken, kath, prashn, mundak, manducya aadi pracheen upanishad bhartiya chintan ke adistrot hai
 The philosophy of the Upanishads is spiritual
 brahm kii sadhana hi upanishdon kaa mukhya lakshya he
 Brahma is also called a soul
 "aatma" vishayjagat, sharir, indriyon, man, buddhi aadi sabhi avgamy tatwon sa pare ek anirvachaneey or atindriya tatv he, jo chitswarup, anant or aanandamay he
 Being beyond all passages, it is infinite
 aparichhann or ek hone ke kaaran aatma bhedamulak jagat main manushyon ke bich aantarik abhed or advait kaa aadhaar ban saktaa he
 The soul is the true nature of man
 uskaa saakshaatkaar karke manushya man ke samast bandhanon se mukt ho jaataa he
 Maya's inexplicable power has been conceived to explain how the root world is born from the soul or Brahman for the fulfillment of monotheism
 kintu sristiwad kii apeksha atmik advaitabhaav upanishdon ke vedant kaa adhik mahatvapurn paksh he
 This monotheism is steeped in Indian culture
 darshan ke kshetra main upanishdon kaa yah brahmavaad aadi shankaracharya, ramanujacharya aadi ke uttarkalin vedant maton kaa aadhaar bana
 Being the last part of the Vedas, the Upanishads are also called "vedanta"
 upanishdon kaa abhimath hi aage chalakar vedant kaa siddhant or sampradaayon kaa aadhaar ban gaya
 The style of the Upanishads is simple and serious
 anubhav ke gambhir tatv atyant saral bhashaa main upanishdon main vyakt hue hai
 To understand them, light of experience is required
 brahm kaa anubhav hi upanishdon kaa lakshya he
 It is only through his practice
 guru kaa sampark usamen adhik sahaayak hota he
 Tenacity, ethics etc
 form the role of cultivation
 karm atmik anubhav kaa sadhak nahin he
 The Upanishads differed from the Karma-dominated Vedic religion
 sanyas, vairaygy, yoga, tap, tyaag aadi ko upanishdon main bahut mahatv diya gaya he
 In these, the source of inspiration of the rigid asceticism of the Shramana tradition appears
 tapowadi jain or buddha mat tathaa gita kaa karmyog upanishdon kii aadhyatmik bhoomi main hi ankurit hue hai
 Darshan has been a very ancient tradition in Hinduism
 vaidic darshanon main shaddarshan adhik prasiddh or pracheen hai
 The Karmaism of the Gita is also contemporary to him
 shaddarshanon ko 'aastik darshan' kaha jaataa he
 They believe in the power of Vedas
 hindu darshanik parampara main vibhinn prakaar ke aastik darshanon ke alaava anishvaravaadi or bhautikwaadi darshanik paramparaayen bhi vidyaman raheen hai
 This philosophy composed by Maharishi Gautama describes the attainment of salvation from the philosophy of substances

 Its main principle is that the origin of Satya is not possible by lack of feeling or discrete
 sat kaarnon se hi sat kaaryo kii utpatti ho sakati he
 Sankhya philosophy considers the creation of nature and the sequence of destruction in particular
 saath hi isamen prakruti ke param sookshm kaaran tathaa uske sahit 24 kaary padaathon kaa spasht varnan kiya gaya he
 Male is considered to be the 25th element, which is not a disorder of nature
 is prakaar prakruti samast kaary padaatho kaa kaaran to he, parantu prakruti kaa kaaran koi nahin he, kyonki uski shaashvat satta he
 Man is the conscious element, then nature is unconscious
 purush prakruti kaa bhokta he, jabaki prakruti swayan bhokti nahin he
 Maharishi Patanjali is the author of this philosophy
 isamen ishwar, jeevatma or prakruti kaa spasht rup se varnan kiya gaya he

 Compound verbs are described in detail
 is siddhant ke anusaar paramatma kaa dhyaan aantarik hota he
 As long as our senses are outward, meditation is never possible
 iske anusaar paramatma ke mukhya naam o3m kaa jaap na karke anya naamon se paramatma kii stuti or upasna apurna hi he
 Mimamsutra is the original book of this philosophy, whose author is Maharishi Jaimini
 is darshan main vaidic yagyon main mantron kaa viniyog tathaa yagyon kii prakriyaaon kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 If the Yoga philosophy suggests a measure of inner purification, then Mimamsa philosophy describes the duties and duties of human life from family life to national life, so that the whole nation can progress
 jis prakaar sampurna karmkand mantron ke viniyog par aadhaarit hai, usee prakaar mimasaa darshan bhi mantron ke viniyog or uske vidhaan kaa samarthan karata he
 Maharishi Jaimini has also considered Veda to be the ultimate proof for religion
 unke anusaar yagyon main mantron ke viniyog, shruti, vaakya, prakaran, sthaan evam samakhya ko moulik aadhaar mana jaataa he
 Vedanta means the ultimate principle of the Vedas
 maharishi vyas dwaara rachit brahmasutra is darshan kaa mul granth he
 This philosophy is also known as Uttar Mimamsa
 is darshan ke anusaar brahm jagat kaa karta-dharta va sanhaar karta hone se jagat kaa nimitt kaaran he
 No factor or integral cause
 brahm sarvajna, sarvashaktimaan, aanandamay, nity, anadi, anantadi gun vishisht shaashvat satta he
 Also, birth and death are devoid of tribulations and also formless
 is darshan ke pratham sutara `athato brahm jigyaasa ́ se hi spasht hota he ki jise jaanane kii ichha he, vah brahm se bhinn he, anyathaa swayan ko hi jaanane kii ichha kaise ho sakati he
 And it is well known that Jeevatma has always been taking measures to get rid of its sufferings
 parantu brahm kaa gun isse bhinn he
 Later, many sects of Vedanta became
 shad darshanon ke alaava lokayat tathaa shaiva evam shakt darshan bhi hindu darshan ke abhinn ang hai
 Being anti-vedic, the Charvak faith is also named in the atheist sects
 bhautikwaadi hone ke kaaran yah aadar na paa sakaa
 Its history and literature are also not available
 "brihaspati sutara" ke naam se ek charvak granth ke uddhran anya darshan granthon main milte hai
 Charvakism is a type of realism and materialism

 The soul, God, heaven etc
 are all imaginary

 He is not reborn
 jeevankaal main yathasambhav sukh kii sadhana karnaa hi jivan kaa lakshya hona chahie
 In the spiritualism and tapoism of the Upanishads, it took the form of a manifest revolution against Vedic rituals
 upanishad kaal main ek ore buddha or jain dharmon kii avaidic paramparaon kaa aavirbhaav hua tathaa duusari ore vaidic darshanon kaa udai hua
 In the two centuries before and after the birth of Christ, parallel streams of many philosophies began to flow on the Indian land of thought
 buddha or jain darshanon kii dharaayen bhi inamen sammilit hai
 Jainism began before Buddhism
 mahavir swami ke purv 23 jain tirthakar ho chuke the
 Mahavir Swami preached Jainism

 The time of both BC Considered to be the sixth century
 inhone vedon se swatantra ek naveen dharmik parampara kaa pravartan kiya
 Jain and Buddhist philosophies are also called "atheist philosophies" due to non-acceptance of Vedas
 inkaa moulik sahitya kramash: mahavir or buddha ke upadeshon ke rup main he jo kramash: praakrit or pali kii lokbhashaon main miltaa he tathaa jiskaa sangrah in mahapurushon ke nirvana ke baad kai sangitiyon main unke anuyaayiyon ke paraamarsh ke dwaara hua
 Both Buddha and Mahavira were princes of the Himalayan region
 yuvavay main hi sanyas lekar unhone apane dharmo kaa upadesh or prachaar kiya
 His renunciation is inspired by the tradition of the Upanishads
 jain or buddha dharmon main tap or tyaag kii mahima bhi upanishdon ke dasharn ke anukool he
 These religions are characterized by non-violence and the importance of ethics and denial of caste discrimination
 ahimsa ke beej bhi upanishdon main vidyaman hai
 Nevertheless, the credit of hoisting the flag of non-violence into the sky of religion will have to be credited to Jain and Buddhist sects

 Being Buddhist, Buddhism was opposed to Vedanta
 is virodh kaa fal yah hua ki buddha dharm ko bharat se nirvasit hona padaa
 But it was propagated in the eastern countries of Asia
 buddha ke anuyaayiyon main matbhed ke kaaran kai sampradaay ban gaye
 According to Siddhantbheda, four philosophies are famous in the Buddhist tradition
 inamen vaibhashik or sautrantik mat hinayan parampara main hai
 This is Southern Buddhism
 iskaa prachaar bhi lanka main he
 Yogachara and secondary schools are in the Mahayana tradition
 yah uttari baudhdhamat he
 These four philosophies emerged in the early words of Christ
 isi samay vaidic parampara main shaddarshanon kaa udai hua
 Thus, the emergence of philosophy cults in Indian tradition has taken place almost simultaneously and they have developed through mutual opposition
 pashchimi darshanon kii bhanti ye darshan purvapar kram main udit nahin hue hai
 Vasubandhu, Kumarlat Maitreya and Nagarjuna were the main teachers of these philosophies
 vaibhashik mat bahya vastuon kii satta tathaa swalakshanon ke rup main unka pratyaksh maanata he
 Hence it is called external positivism or "totalitarianism"
 saitrantik mat ke anusaar padaarthon kaa pratyaksh nahin, anumaan hota he
 Hence it is called externalism
 yogachaar mat ke anusaar bahya padaarthon kii satta nahin
 What we see is just science

 Zero means selfless, unformed, or indescribable
 shoonyavad kaa yah shunya vedant ke brahm ke bahut nikat aa jaataa he
 Arthashastra is one of the major primitive texts that propound Indian political philosophy

 All creatures, whether they are animals or plants, are true models of their ancestors
 vaigyanik bhashaa main ise 'samaan se samaan kii utpati' kaa siddhant kehete hai
 Certain factors are specifically studied under genetics: pratham kaarak anuvanshikta he
 The heredity of an organism is the chemical information received by the germ cells of its parents
 jaise koi praani kis prakaar parivardhit hoga, iskaa nirdhaaran uski anuvanshikta hi karegi
 The second factor is the difference that we can find or find in a creature and its offspring
 praayah sabhi jeev apane mata pita yaa kabhi kabhi baba, daadi yaa unase purvai kii peedi ke lakshan pradarshit karte hai
 It is also possible that some of its traits are completely new
 is prakaar ke parivartanon yaa vibhedon ke anek kaaran hote hai
 The growth and subsequent life of organisms also depends on their environment
 praaniyon ke parivesh atyant jatil hote hai; iske antargat jeev ke ve samast padaarth, bal tathaa anya sajiv praani samahit hai, jo unke jivan ko prabhavit karte rahete hai
 The scientist studies all these factors in one sentence, we can say that genetics is the science under which genetics and their ancestors due to geneticism have studied similarities and differences, reasons for their origin and the possibilities of evolution

 johonsen ne san 1911 main jeevon ke bahya lakshanon tathaa pitraagat lakshanon main bhed sthapit kiya
 The external characteristics of organisms change with their growth, such as adequate physical differentiation of organisms in embryonic, infancy, puberty and old age
 iske vipareet unke pitraagat lakshan yaa visheshtaayen sthir tathaa aparivartansheel hoti hai
 The natural characteristics of any organism and the interactions of the environment result in its growth and development

 All of this is due to genetics, which has proved to be the ultimate beneficiary for human welfare
 anek vaigyanikon kaa mat he ki manushya kaa anuvanshik adhyayan saral kaary nahin he
 The reason for this is stated that the birth of a human child takes about 10 months and it takes at least 20 years to become a full adult
 atah ek do peedi ke hi adhyayan ke liye 20,22 varsho kaa samay lagane ke kaaran manushya kaa anuvanshik adhyayan jatil he
 With this, a man usually produces only one child at a time, which also makes it difficult to study

 Structuralism or structural psychology in psychology is a consciousness theory developed by Wilhelm Wunt and Edward Bradford Tichner

 He started it at Cornell University in the US
 bunt ne 1879 main lipjing vishvavidhyalay main manovigyaan kii pratham prayogshaala kii sthapana kii or manovigyaan ke swaroop ko prayogtmak bana diya
 Boont considered psychology to be a study of conscious cognition, which could be analyzed basically into two elements
 ve do tatv the- sanvaden tathaa bhav
 Boont called Chetan an objective element
 bunt kaa vichaar tha ki prayek bhav kaa adhyayan teen vibhaaon main avasthit kiya ja saktaa he- uttejnaa-shant, tanaav-shithilan tathaa sukhad-dukhad
 This was called the three dimensional theory of sentiment
 tichanar ne bunt kii vichaardhaara ko unnat banaate huye kaha ki chetana ke do nahin teen tatv hote he- sanvaden, pratimaa tathaa anuraag
 Tichner has considered invention a major method of psychology, similar to the Bund
 bunt ne chetana ke tatwon kii do visheshtaayen bataayi thi- gun tathaa tivrata
 Tichner reduced their number to four - quality, intensity, clarity and duration
 tichanar ne dhyaan pratyakshan, saahchary, samvedan aadi kshetron main bhi apana yogadan diya
 According to modern psychologists, the sensations of sleeping consciousness are called dreams
 swapn ke anubhav kii tulana mrigatrushna ke anubhavon se kii gai he
 This is a kind of confusion
 swapn main sabhi vastuon ke abhaav main vibhinn prakaar kii vastuen dikhaai detii hai
 Some of the dreams can be likened to daydreams
 parantu divaswapn main vishesh prakaar ke anubhav karanevaala vyakti jaanata he ki vah amuk prakaar kaa anubhav kar rahaa he
 In the dream state, 99
9% of the experienced people do not know that they are dreaming, but in this world there are some intellectual people whose mind starts thinking more than the capacity which also identify themselves in the dream
 ek prayog ke dauraan kuch vaigyaniko ne bhi mana ki aisa sambhav lekin jab wo swapn main khud ko pahchaan legein to us swapn se baahar aana kaaphi masakkat bharaa hoga or isse kamjor dimag vaale vyakti ke coma main jane ke asaar kaaphi bad jate he aisi ghatana kisi vyakti ke saath hona kisi chamatkaar se kam nahin he
 The events of the dream relate to the present tense
 divaswapn kii ghatnaayen bhootkaal tathaa bhavishyakaal se sambandh rakhti hai
 According to the Indian view, dream is one of the four states of consciousness
 baaki teen avasthaaen jaagrathavastha, sushupti avasthaa or turiya avasthaa hai
 There are many similarities between dream and waking state
 atev jaagrathavastha ke aadhaar par swapn anubhavon ko samajhaayaa jaataa he
 Similarly, experiences of waking state are also explained on the basis of dream experiences
 swapn insaan kii yaadon, bhaawanaao, kalpanaao, soch, vichaaron, ichchhaaon or sabase bada uske dar kaa mila ek praaroop he
 The study of dreams is a new subject for psychology
 saadhaarant: swapn kaa anubhav aisa anubhav he jo hamaare saamaanya tark ke anusaar sarvatha nirarthak dikhaai detaa he
 Therefore, people who discuss the subject of psychological dreams are generally considered as useless people
 pracheen kaal main saadhaaran anpadh log swapn kii charchaa isliye kiya karte the ki ve samajhate the ki swapn ke dwaara is bhavi ghatnaon kaa andaaj laga sakate hai
 This belief remains in the general public even today
 aadhunik vaigyanik chintan is prakaar kii dharna ko niraadhaar maanata he or ise andhvishwaas samajhataa he
 Scientific studies of dreams have tried to find out what kinds of dreams can occur due to the influence of external stimuli
 soe hue kisi manushya ke pair par thandha pani daalane se use praaia: nadi main chalane kaa swapn hota he
 Similarly, due to cold at bedtime, one may dream of bathing or swimming in the river
 sharir par honevaale vibhinn prakaar ke prabhaav bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke swapnon ko utpann karte hai
 Dreams have also been studied from the medical point of view
 saadhaarant: rog kii badi chadhi avasthaa main rogi bhayanak swapn dekhtaa he or jab vah acha hone lagata he to vah swapnon main saumy drishy dekhtaa he
 Psychologists sometimes use hypnosis to study dreams
 vishesh prakaar ke sammohan dekar jab rogi ko sula diya jaataa he to use un sammohanon ke anusaar swapn dikhaai dete hai
 Some psychologists instruct the patient to remember dreams while sleeping
 tab rogi apane swapnon ko nahin bhuulataa
 The mental patient does not remember the dream initially
 aisi rogi ko sammohit karke uske swapn yaad karaae ja sakate hai
 Generally, we see the same things in dreams, whose values are formed on our mind
 ham praaia: dekhte hai ki hamaare swapnon kaa jaagrath avasthaa se koi sambandh nahin hota
 Sometimes we forget the parts of the dream which have special meaning for our life
 aise swapnon ko kushal manovaigyanik sammohan dwaara praapt kar lete hai
 It has been seen that the dreams which a man forgets, bring such things of his life to the consciousness which are extremely unpleasant to him and which are forgotten only for him
 aisi baton ko vishesh prakaar ke sammohan dwaara vyakti ko yaad karaayaa ja saktaa he
 These dreams have special importance in mental medicine
 bhartiya jyotish shaastra ke anusaar jis pahar or paksh main swapn dekha gaya hai uske anusaar hi swapn kaa fal nishchit kiya jaataa hai
 Dr
 Sigmund Freud has made the most important discoveries about dreams
 inhone apane adhyayan se yah nirdhaarit kiya ki manushya ke bhitari man ko jaanane ke liye uske swapnon ko jaananaa nitant aavashyak he
 In his treatise entitled "interpretation of Dreams and Dreams", he tried to explain that dreams which we think as meaningless have special meaning
 inhone swapnon ke sanketon ke arth bataane or unki rachana ko spasht karne kii cheshtaa kii he
 According to his statement, the dream expresses our desires in general or symbolically, which does not satisfy its waking state
 pita kii daant ke dar se jab balak mithai or khilone kharidne kii apni ichha ko prakat nahin karata to uski damit ichha swapn ke dwaara apni tripti paa leti he
 As the age of man increases, his fear of society gets complicated
 is bhay ke kaaran vah apni anuchit ichchhaaon ko na keval dusron se chhipaane kii cheshtaa karata he varan vah swayan se bhi chhipaata he
 According to Dr
 Freud, the human mind has three parts
 pehla bhaag vah he jisamen sabhi icchaayen aakar apni tripti paati hai
 To satisfy them, a man has to work with his willpower
 man kaa yah bhaag chetan man kehalaata he
 This part coordinates the person with the outer world
 manushya ke man kaa doosraa bhaag achetan man kehalaata he
 This part is the shelter of all his pleasures
 isi main uski sabhi damit icchaayen rahati hai
 The third part of his mind is called subconscious mind
 is bhaag main manushya kaa naitik swatv rahata he
 Dr
 Freud has equated moral self with the state's censor department
 jis prakaar rajya kaa censor vibhaag kisi nae samachar ke prakashit hone ke purv uski chaanbin kar letaa he
 In the same way, the sensor present in the subconscious mind of man, ie the moral self, trumps any lust before it is published in the dream
 atyant apriy athwa aniatik swapn dekhne ke pashchaat manushya ko aatmabhatrsana hoti he
 In order to save the dreamer from this self-abnegation, the sensor's department of his mind illuminates the suppressed desire by manipulating many kinds of dreams
 phir jaagrath hone par yahi censor hamen swapn ke us bhaag ko bhulawa detaa he
 Which causes self-immolation
 isi kaaran ham puure swapnon ko hi bhul jate hai
 Dr
 Freud has given special types of meanings to dream symbols
 inamen se adhik pratik jananendriya sambandhi hai
 According to his statement, many fruitless actions occurring in dreams are indicative of movement
 unka kathan he ki manushya kii pradhan vaasana, kamvasana he
 This gives him maximum physical pleasure and this is also the most oppressed in his life
 swapn main adhiktar hamaari damit icchaayen hi chhipakar vibhinn pratikon dwaara prakashit hoti hai
 The most pitying desire is libido
 isliye hamaare adhik swapn usee se sambandh rakhte hai
 In the case of mental patients it is seen that on the one hand his strong libido remains in repressed state and on the other hand it is difficult for him to accept his presence
 isliye hi maansik rogiyon ke swapn na keval jatil hote hai varan ve bhul bhi jate hai
 Dr
 Freud has given five-seven types of dreaming
 unamem se pradhan hai - sankshepan, vistarikaran, bhavantarakaran tathaa naatakeekaran
 According to the abbreviation, a very large context is truncated
 vistarikaran main thik iskaa ulta hota he
 In this, dreaming expresses a little experience in a long dream
 maan lijie kisi vyakti ne kisi party main hamaara apmaan kar diya or iskaa ham badla lenaa chaahate hai
 But our moral dream is against it, then we will see in our dream that the person who has insulted us is lying in many kinds of accidents
 ham uski sahaayta karnaa chaahate hai, parantu paristhitiyon aisi hai jinke kaaran ham uski sahaayta nahin kar pate
 In the state of emotionalization, we do not see our immoral sentiments being published towards such a person, towards whom the revelation of those sentiments creates self-aggression
 kabhi-kabhi kishor balak bhayanak swapn dekhte hai
 In them they find themselves fighting with a demon
 manovishleshan se peeche pataa chalata he ki yah rakshas unka pita, chachaa, bada bhai, adhyaaapak athwa koi anushaasak hi rahata he
 According to the dramatization, when an idea is illuminated in a desire or dream, it mostly takes the support of the vision images
 swapnchetana anek maarmik baton ko ek puri paristhiti chitrit karke dikhaati he
 The dream does not give any education directly
 swapn main jo anek chitron or ghatnaon ke sahare koi bhav vyakt hota he uskaa arth turant lagaana sambhav nahin hota
 Suppose we are alone and we fear that no one can attack us
 yah chota sa bhav anek swapnon ko utpann karata he
 We fall into a situation where we feel safe but we feel betrayed later
 doctor frid kaa kathan he ki swapn ke do rup hote hai - ek prakashit or doosraa aprakashit
 The dream we remember is the illuminated form
 yah rup uparyukt anek prakaar kii tod mode kii rachanaaon or pratikon ke saath hamaari chetana ke samaksh aata he
 The actual form of the dream is that which is achieved through esoteric psychological discovery
 swapn kaa jo arth saamaanya log lagaate hai vah uske vaastavik arth se bahut dur hota he
 This real meaning cannot be applied without dreaming art
 doctor frid ne swapnanubhav ke bare main nimnlikhit baat mahatv kii bataai hai : swapn maansik pratigaman kaa parinaam he
 This regression lasts for a short period
 atev isse vyakti ke maansik vikaas kii kii kshati nahin hoti
 Secondly this regression occurs in the form of acting
 is kaaran isse manushya kii un ichchhaaon kaa rechan ho jaataa he jo bachapan kii avasthaa kii hoti hai
 If a person does not have such dreams, then his mental development stops or he gets some kind of mental disease
 doctor frid ne duusari mahatv kii baat yah bataai he ki swapn nidra kaa vinaashak nahin varan uskaa rakshak he
 The repressed excitement comes out of terrible or aggravating dreams
 swapn maanav shravan kii jatil samasyaon ko hal karne kaa ek maarg he
 Freud stated the third point that the dream is neither a vain mental experience nor the visuals seen in it are meaningless
 apriy swapnon dwaara vyakti ke maansik swasthya kii raksha hoti he
 Studying dreams is absolutely necessary to understand the inner form of the mind
 swapnon ko doctor frid ne manushya ke aantarik man kii kunjee kaha he
 Many suppressed feelings of the patient come to the surface of consciousness due to dream-related interactions and thus their catharsis
 kisi rogi ke anek swapn sunate or unka arth lagaate lagaate rogi kaa rog nasht ho jaataa he
 In the initial stage of mental therapy, the patient often does not remember dreams
 jaise-jaise rogi or chikitsak kii bhavatmak ekta sthapit hoti he vaise-vaise use swapn adhikadhik hone lagate hai tathaa ve adhikadhik spasht bhi hote hai
 The same dream occurs in many ways
 swapn kaa bhav anek prakaar ke swapnon dwaara chikitsak ke samaksh aata he
 Charles Yung has said some things different from Dr
 Freud about the dream
 unke kathananusaar swapn ke pratik sabhi samay ek hi arth nahin rakhte
 To know the true meaning of dreams, it is absolutely necessary to know the dreamer's personality, to understand its special problems and to keep in mind the country, time and circumstances at that time
 ek hi swapn bhinn-bhinn swapndrashtaa ke liye bhinn-bhinn arth rakhata he or ek hi drashtaa ke liye bhinn-bhinn paristhitiyon main bhi uske bhinn-bhinn arth hote hai
 Therefore, until the dreamer himself accepts any meaning, we should not know that the true meaning of the dream will be obtained
 doctor frid kii manyata ke anusaar adhik swapn hamaari kaam vaasana se hi sambandh rakhte hai
 According to Yung, dreams are not only a suppression of a person's personal experience or his selfish desires, but also the spiritual experiences of his most serious mind
 isi ke kaaran manushya apane swapnon ke dwaara jeevanopayogi shiksha bhi praapt kar letaa he
 According to Charles Yung, dreams are not merely a reaction to old experiences, but they are related to the future life of man
 doctor frid saamaanya prakritik jadwaadi karankarya pranali ke anusaar manushya ke man kii sabhi pratikriyaaon ko samajhane kii cheshtaa karte hai
 In contrast to these, doctor Yung proves to be primarily targeted at mental reactions
 jo vaigyanik pranali jad padaarthon ke vyavhaaron ko samajhane ke liye upyukt hoti he vahi pranali chetan kriyaaon ko samajhane main nahin lagaai ja sakati
 All the functions of consciousness are objective
 swapn bhi isi prakaar kaa ek lakshyapurna kaary he jiskaa uddeshy rogi ke bhavi jivan ko neerog athwa safal bananaa he
 According to Yung's statement, a man can know such things by dream, according to which he can save himself from many kinds of accidents and sorrows
 is tathy ko unhone anek drushtaanton ke dwaara samajhaayaa he
 Science of dreams - We dream all night
 divaa swapn bhi aksar log dekhte rahete hai, divaa swapn kalpana kehalaate hai
 The dream seen in the sleep is the dream
 kabhi kabhi kuch kam avadhi ke swapn yaad rahete hai
 In Shruti, the subject of dreams has been discussed from place to place
 vrihadaaranyak upanishad main swapn ke vishay main prasang he, jis prakaar ek raja apane sevak or praja ke saath desh kaa bhraman karata he usee prakaar jeev swapnavastha main praan, shabd, vaani aadi ko lekar is sharir main icchaanusaar vichrata he
 There is a description in the Vrhadaranyaka Upanishad, that in one's own life, the living being sees both the world and the world, and the sorrow experiences both happiness and happiness
 is sthool sharir ko achet karke jeev vaasanamay sharir kii rachana karata he phir lok paralok dekhtaa he

 Trees, feces, urine, women, men, sex, anger, fear etc

 This composition is very mysterious and very bizarre

 In the dream state, both the spirit and the spirit of the soul experience the word touch form juice smell mentally
 taijas sookshm vishyon kaa bhokta he
 Both nature and spirit are impenetrable like the reflection of the sky in the water drop and in the reservoir
 The Yatha Sopanishad says - 'yesh supteshu jagarti kamam kamam purusho nirmanamah': This man who creates many pleasures when everyone is asleep Wakes up on his own
 yahan purush ko kaamanaayon kaa nirmaataa batalaaya he
 Therefore, there is a creation in the dream, is the creation in the dream real? -taatkaalik rup se swapn main hui sristi kaa koi astitv nahin dikhaayi detaa parantu is vishay main meraa nishchit vichaar he ki swapn main jo bhi dekha suna jaataa he use sristi main kisi na kisi jagah kisi na kisi jeev athwa padaarth ke rup main hona nishchit he
 There is a deep connection between the dream and the development of the world, if there is a dream, then there is a world and if there is a creation, there are dreams
 swapn ke shubh–ashubh parinaam-shruti kaa is vishay main nishchat mat he ki swapn bhavishya main hone vaale shubh–ashubh parinaam ke suchak hai

 sushupti vah avasthaa he jab koi swapn bhi nahin rahata
 prashnopenishad bataata he jab udaan vaayu dwaara CNS purna rup se adhikaar kar liya jaataa he tab sushupti avasthaa hoti he
 Vedanta tells that the senses and their subjects do not remain in the sleep period
 There is no attachment in this state, the organism experiences joy here

 Practical powers and dream traps are absorbed in ignorance for their own reasons

 It can have three parts: len-denon ke likhane kii prakriya arthath vyapaarik bhaag jise pustapaalan kaha ja saktaa he
 a creative work can be called a process ie a theoretical part called accounting
 aalochanatmak kaary kii prakriya arthath vivechanaatmak bhaag jise ankekshan kaha ja saktaa he
 Earlier there was no special distinction between manual and accounting work
 parantu aaj ke audyogic yug main pustapaalan tathaa lekhankan donon pruthak kaary ho gayi hai
 Generally, the following tasks fall under the areas of manual, accounting and auditing: pustapaalan- jaisaa ki uparyukt bindu se spasht he, pustapaalan jarnal tathaa khatabahi main vyapaarik saudon ke lekhe karne kii kala he
 Any person with the simple ability to keep accounts can do this work with convenience
 yah kaary yantravat likh dena maatr he
 Accounting- According to the above point, the work of the accountant starts after the work of the bookkeeper
 isi kaaran yah kaha jaataa he ki jahaan se pustapaalan samaapt hota he, vahiin se lekhankan prarambh hota he
 In this area, the work of preparing the final accounts and making necessary errors and corrections comes from taking out the balance
 sankshep main, kaary saransh tathaa vishleshan karne kii prakriya he
 Summary means flat and then its analysis is done by preparing the final accounts
 lekhapal ek sushikshit vyakti hota hai jo pustapaalan ke kaary main bhi chatur hota he

 e dablyoo hanson- sampoorn lekhon kii aisi jaanch ko ankekshan kehete he jinase ki un par vishwaas kiya ja sake tathaa unke dwaara bataaye hue vivaranon par bhi vishwaas kiya ja saken
 In conclusion based on the above definitions- ankekshan kisi vyapaarik sanstha kii hisaab-kitaab kii pustakon kii vishisht evam vivechanaatmak jaanch he, jo ek yogya tathaa nishpaksh vyakti dwaara sanstha se praapt pramankon, prapatron soochnaaon tathaa spashtikarnon kii sahaayta se kii jaati he, jisase ki ankekshak ek nishchit samay ke liye banaaye hue hisaab-kitaab ke sambandh main yah report de sake ki, Institution - The audit of any institution can be done
 swatantra vyakti- ankekshan kaary kisi aise vyakti dwaara hona chahie jiskaa vyapaar athwa sanstha se kisi bhi prakaar kaa sambandh na ho
 Only then a fair investigation is possible
 at: vartmaan main chartered lekhapal kii niyukti kii gai hai
 Form of the investigation- The test conducted by the audit does not only reveal the accuracy related to mathematics, but it is an intelligent unbiased test which shows the absolute accuracy of the calculation
 lekha pustaken- ankekshan main lekha-pustakon kii jaanch hoti he
 The auditor does not have to restrict his field of work to only books, but also has to know other statutory books and various facts
 pramank evam prapatr- lekha pustakon kii jaanch pramankon evam prapatron ke aadhaar par kii jaati he, yadi yah uplabdh na hon to inaki pratilipiyon se pushti kii jaati hai
 Information and Explanation - The basis of the inquiry is the evidence itself, but if the auditor is not satisfied with the memorization certificate, then for verification of the transactions one can ask for information and clarification
 budhimattapurna- ankekshan dwaara kii jane vaali jaanch kaa kaary bahut mahatvapurn he at: is kaary main buddhi evam chaturaai kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo is kaary ke anubhav se praapt hoti he
 Purpose of checking- The purpose of checking the books of accounts is to verify the results of the profit and loss account created in a certain period and the assets and obligations shown in the letter on a certain date and give a certificate on satisfaction
 vastav main ankekshak ko antim khaaton kii jaanch par apni raay prakat kerani hoti he
 Regularity - Under the Indian Companies Act, 1956, some important rules should be kept in mind while creating the company's letter and profit and loss account
 at: company ankekshak ko apni report main likhnaa hota he ki chittha niyamaanukool he athwa nahin
 Period- Auditing is generally done for accounts of one financial year or one accounting year
 yadi ek se adhik varsh ke lekhon kaa ankekshan kiya jaataa he to yah jaanch anusandhan kehalaati he
 Result- After checking the articles, a report has to be given regarding its veracity and appropriateness
 yadi ankekshak kisi baat se asantusht he to iskaa varnan spasht rup se apni report main karata he
 As an accounting imperative, accounting in practical terms is essential to keep the business alive and to gain prestige in the society
 iske liye nimnlikhit tark diye ja sakate hai : In today's era, accurate knowledge of profit or loss from a business is not a concept without accounting
 vyavsaayee kii aarthik sthiti suddadh va aarthik saadhan bahut achche hon, to bhi anya vyavsaayee ke mukaable sasti bechney ke falswaroop bikri adhik ho lekin sirf diwaala nikalne par hi use pataa chalegaa ki usne vastu ko laagat se bhi kam main bech diya he
 There are more transactions in the business, especially where the goods are sold more on credit, it is not possible to remember the names of the debtors, so accounting is mandatory
 ek nishchit avadhi kii samaapti par laabh hua athwa haani
 Accounting is mandatory for this
 vyavsaayik lekha-pustaken yadi sucharu tareeke se rakhi jaayen to chaluvarsh kii aay-vyay yaa laabh-haani kii tulana pichley varshon ke laabh-haani se kii ja sakati he
 Through accounting, the trader gets to know his financial position
 kar-nirdhaaran main lekhon kaa bahut mahatv he
 If the accounts are kept according to the rules then these are very helpful
 ek vyapaaree ko kin-kin vyaktiyon ko kul kitna rupaya dena he, yah soochna lekhankan se hi mil sakati he
 More profit can be made by starting unprofitable actions except for non-profitable actions and if there is a deficiency in efficiency then they can be overcome by knowing their reasons
 yah kaary lekhakarm dwaara hi sambhav he
 If proper books of accounts are kept in a business, then the reputation of that business increases
 lekhankan ke nimnlikhit laabh bhi hai : ACCOUNTING LUXURY AS chote vyapaariyon ke liye ise vilasita mana gaya he kyonki inaki simit aavashyaktaaen hoti hai kintu vartmaan samay main yah purna rup se uchit prathit nahin hoti he
 Auditing as Luxury lagaana he phir bhi hisaab-kitaab main chal-kapat chhipe rah jate he, jo ankekshak uchit chaturaai va saavdhaanee ke baavjood nahin pakad saktaa hai
 Hence the audit is meaningless
 uparokt tathyon ke aadhaar par ham kah sakate hai ki chote-chote vyapaar main ankekshan vilasita he lekin sabhi vyavsaayon ke liye ankekshan ko vilasita kahana galat hoga
 Small organizations where there are one or two employees and the owner of accounting is looked after by a sole trader or partner, so auditing is not necessary, but in big business it is profitable and highly necessary, not luxury
 ankekshan kaa vilasita na hona Enhancing the efficiency of the employees - The efficiency of the employee increases as a result of the audit, because they know that an error can be detected by the auditor if the work is not done properly! karmchaariyon kii kaarykushalta main vruddhi-kushal ankekshan ke falswaroop karmchaariyon apane-apane kaary main daksh ho jate hai kyonki ankekshak samay-samay par apni report main tathaa ankekshan ke dauraan bhi kamiyon ko bataata rahata he va maargdarshan bhi karata rahata he
 Increase in efficiency of managers- When the managers know that the auditor will submit their report on the work done by them, which will be acceptable, they will do their work with full sincerity
 vyavsaay ke vikaas main sahaayak- ankekshit hisaab-kitaab par sabhi vishwaas karte hai tathaa isse vyapaar kii khyaati main vruddhi hoti he tathaa sabhi ore se vyavsaay ko suvidhaayen praapt hoti hai jisase vyavsaay kaa vikaas hota hai
 Decision in case of insolvency possible- If the books of accounts are properly conducted and audited, then the court can help in getting the debt relief order
 ho saktaa he iske abhaav main samay adhik lag jaay
 Assistants in future planning - The managers conduct comparative studies on the basis of the final accounts of several years and see how the efficiency can be increased
 plant evam mashin kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi- laagat lekhon ke ankekshan se yah maaloom hota he ki mashiinon kii kitni kaaryakshmata he tathaa kin-kin kaarnon se mashiinon kii purna kaaryakshmata kaa prayog nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Efficiency can be increased by acquiring information about these reasons
 ankekshan kii anivaaryta Auditing affects efficiency, so it cannot be called luxury
 nimnakint dashaon main yah anivaary hai – Thus it would not be completely true to say that accounting is mandatory and auditing is a luxury
 chote vyapaar main kahin-kahin lekhankan bhi vilasita he jabaki bade vyavsaayon ke liye anivaary hi he
 But still accounting and auditing are two sides of a coin
 yadi lekhankan na ho to ankekshan kiskaa hoga
 And if accounting is alone then it does not have the credibility of its veracity
 truti karnaa maanav swabhaav kaa ek bhaag hai ankekshan kaa pramukh uddeshy bhi ashuddhi va gaban kaa pataa lagaana va unhen rokna hota hai
 Checking of preliminary articles, journal checking, checking of cash balances, checking of balances of accounts, checking of account books of subsidiary books, matching of previous year's floor, finding the amount of difference, to check the auditor's errors Can take action etc
 yadi ankekshak apane kaary main itani saavdhaanee, kushalta evam budhimaani kaa prayog kare jitna ki un paristhitiyon main sammav tha or usne purna praytn kiya ho jo ki trutiyon ko dhund nikaalane hetu param aavashyak tha
 If still unable to detect fraud, the auditor cannot be held liable
 ankekshan kaary kaa arth yah kabhi nahin hota 'ki ankekshak ne ashuddhiyon evam gaban kaa beemaa kar liya he, na hi vah is baat kii garanti detaa he ki samast ashuddhiyon evam gaban ko dhund nikaalega
 He is only expected to do his work with due care and cleverness
 AAS-1 main un aadharbhoot siddhanton ke vishay main bataaya gaya he jo ankekshak ke peshewar dayitvon se sambandhit hai tathaa jinka paalan ankekshan karte samay anivaary he

 This review and evaluation show whether: ankekshan prativedan main vittiya soochnaaon par raay kii spashtatah likhit abhivyakti kaa samavesh hona chahie
 The AAS-2 "objective and Scope of the Audit of Financial Statements" states that the field of the auditor is determined keeping in view the appointment conditions, prevailing statutes, etc
 of the auditor

 To this end, the auditor follows such procedures to assure that the financial statements give a true and fair picture of the financial position and operating results of an enterprise
 ' The auditor, with his professional experience and decision-making ability, sets certain criteria for investigation, while doing so he cannot be expected to work outside his area of competence
 ankekshak apane kaary ko seemaa nirdhaarit kar hi kaary prarambh karata he
 There are two such limits: - Extensive limit, Intensive limit
