 Premchand took literature to the surface of truth
 unhone jivan or kalkhand kii sachai ko panne par utaara
 He continued to write for a lifetime on communalism, corruption, zamindari, indebtedness, poverty, colonialism
 premachand kii zyaadaatar rachanaaen unki hi garibi or dainyata kii kahani kahati he
 It is also not wrong that he was the creator of the common Indian

 Premchand is the era promoter of Hindi literature
 unhone hindi kahani main aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad kii ek nai parampari shuru kii
 Despite being such a great creator, Premchand's life is not free from accusations
 premchand ke adhyeta kamalkishor goyanka ne apni pustak 'premchand : adhyayan kii nai dishaaen' main premchand ke jivan par kuch aarope lagaakar unke sahitya kaa mahatv kam karne kii koshish kii
 The main allegations against Premchand are- Premchand left his first wife without any reason and even after second marriage, he had a relationship with another woman, Premchand cheated Vinodashankar Vyas in 'jagran Brawl', Premchand's senior press Employee Pravasi Lal Verma Frauded, Workers Strike in Premchand's Press, Premchand Supports Flick When His Daughter Sick Took more

 Premchand is often known as "munshi Premchand"
 premchand ke naam ke saath 'munshi' kab or kaise jud gaya? is vishay main adhikansh log yahi maan lete hai ki prarambh main premchand adhyaaapak rahe
 The teachers were often called Munshi ji at that time

 He also believes that the word Munshi is a sign of respect, which fans of Premchand may have once imposed
 yah tathy anumaan par aadhaarit he
 But the authentic reason for adding the Munshi adjective to Premchand's name is that the letter 'hans' used to co-edit Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 jisaki kuch pratiyon par kanhaiyalaal munshi kaa puraa naam na chhapakar maatr 'munshi' chapa rahata tha saath hi premchand kaa naam is prakaar chapa hota tha- 
 Editor Munshi, premchand'hans' editors were Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 parantu kalantar main pathakon ne 'munshi' tathaa 'premchand' ko ek samaj liya or 'premchand'- 'munshi premchand' ban gaye
 It's but natural
 saamaanya pathak praaia: lekhak kii kritiyon ko padhata he, naam kii sookshmata ko nahin dekha karata
 Today, Premchand's ornamentation of Premchand has become so orthodox that it is only by 'munshi' that Premchand's realization is made and by not saying 'munshi', Premchand's name seems incomplete

 is film ko kul chaar filmafere puraskaron se nawaaza gaya tha jinamein se ek filmafere sarvshereshth film puraskaar bhi tha
 The film starts from the present
 kai varsh biit chuke hote hai or ab adhed umr kaa atuly chakravarti urf bhootnath, jo ki ek vaastukar he, apane karmchaariyon ke saath ek haveli ke khandaron ko giraakar ek nayi imaarat kaa nirmaan karne ja rahaa he
 Seeing those blocks, he remembers the old days
 film samay main peeche chali jaati he or bhootnath gaanv se kolkata shahar naukari kii talash main apane munh bole bahanoi ke yahan aata he jo isi haveli ke mulaazimon kii rihaishgaah main rahata he
 This mansion belongs to one of the big zamindars of the city, Chaudhary Khanadan, who had three brothers - elder Babu, middle Babu and younger Babu
 film main pehle se hi bade babu kaa intkaal hua dikhaaya gaya he
 Bhoothnath gets a job in a Mohini sindoor factory that is owned by Subinay Babu, a Brahmo Samaji and a daughter with Jabba
 raat ko jab bhootnath haveli main chal rahe kriyakalapon ko dekhtaa he to achambhe main pad jaataa he
 Every night, the little babu sits in the hall and heads towards the cell of the tawaif
 vah chhipakar haveli main hi chal rahi manjhale babu kii mehafil kaa bhi anand letaa he
 Bhootnath goes to Subinay Babu to fix the advertisement which is printed soon of the factory but Jaba is there who asks Bhoothnath to read the advertisement
 us vigyaapan main aisi chamatkaari baaten likhi hoti hai ki yadi patni yaa premika us sindur ko dhaaran kar apane pati yaa premi ke saamne padati he to pati athwa premi us par mohit ho jaayegaa
 That night Chhoti Babu's servant Bansi comes to Bhootnath and says that the younger daughter-in-law is calling him
 donon chhipakar choti bahu ke kamare main jate hai or choti bahu bhootnath ko sindur kii dibiya thamakar kahati he ki isamen mohini sindur bhar ke laaye taaki vah apane bewafaa pati ko apane vash main kar sake
 Bhootnath is mesmerized by the beauty and anguish of the younger daughter-in-law and becomes a part of her secrets even if she does not want to
 bhootnath agle din mohini sindur kii sachai subinay babu se sunanaa chahta he lekin subinay babu is baat ko taal jate hai
 Still, he is so distraught with the suffering of the younger daughter-in-law that he takes that vermilion to the younger daughter-in-law
 isi bich bhootnath kaa munh bolaa bahanoi ek swatantraaa senaanee nikalataa he jo bich bazaar angrez police par bam kaa hamalaa kar detaa he or uske baad chali goli-baari main bhootnath kii taang zakhmi ho jaati he
 Jabba treats Bhoothnath
 chot thik ho jane ke baad bhootnath ek achche vaastukar kaa sahyogi ban jaataa he or kuch samay ke liye apane kaam main itnaa tallin ho jaataa he ki vah na hi jabaa or na hi choti bahu kii khabar letaa he
 The vermilion given by Bhoothnath to the younger daughter-in-law does not have any effect; however, Chhoti Babu says to the younger daughter-in-law that if he dances with her like a dancer and celebrates all the night, then he is ready to stay in the house
 choti bahu yah chunauti bhi sweekaar kar leti he or apane pati ko ghar main rakhane ke liye sharaab pinaa or tawaayphon ke jaisaa bartaav bhi shuru kar detii he
 The trick succeeds for a few days and Chhote Babu starts spending time with his younger daughter-in-law
 lekin aiyashi ke shikaar chote babu ek din apni priy tawaayph ke kothe main pahonchte hai to pate hai ki unka dushman chheni dutt uske raas main duba he
 Chhani Dutt and his companions make Chhota Babu bloodied and he becomes crippled
 jab kuch samay baad bhootnath waapas aata he to paata he ki choti bahu ko to sharaab kii lat lag gayi he or chote babu aapng pade hai
 When he goes to Jaba, it is learned that Subinay Babu has just passed away and Jaba is a girl from an elite family rather than Mlech and Subinay Babu had stolen Jabba from the village but at the age of one year He was married to the incomparable Chakraborty of the same village
 apane pati ko thik karne kii ummid main choti bahu bhootnath ke saath kisi siddh purush ke ashram kii ore nikalati he
 The middle babu hears all the things that have happened between Bhootnath and the younger daughter-in-law
 unke safar ke bich main hi manjhale babu ke gurge bhootnath ko maar-markar adhamra kar dete hai or choti bahu kaa kahin bhi pataa nahin chalata he
 The film then arrives in the present and Bhootnath's attendants tell him that they have found a grave in the mansion yard
 jab bhootnath vahaan jaakar dekhtaa he to kankal ke baazuu main pahane huye kade se pahchaan jaataa he ki yah shav choti bahu kaa hi he
 Towards the end of the film, Bhoothnath sits in a carriage with a mind in mind, holding a map of the new building in which Jaba is already seated and the coachman Baggi takes the lead
 is film ke sangeetkaar hemanth kumaar hai or geetkaar shakeel badayunni hai

 a spark plug is an electrical device that is mounted on the cylinder head of an internal combustion engine and ignites compressed fuel, such as aerosols, petrol, ethanol, and liquefied petroleum, through an electric spark
 spark plag main ek vidyut-rodhit kendriya electrode hota he jo baahar kii taraf ek atyant vidyut-rodhit taar dwaara ek prajvalan kundali yaa chumbakeey circuit se judaa hota he, jisase vah plag ke aadhaar main sthapit ek terminal ke saath silendar ke andar ek chingaari utpann karata he
 ATN Lenoir had already used an electric spark plug in his first internal combustion engine in 1860 and he is generally credited with the invention of the spark plug
 spark plag ke liye aarambhik patent main shaamil he nicola testla dwaara, fredrick richard sims or robert bosch 
 But the invention of the first commercially viable high-voltage spark plug as part of a magnet-based ignition system by Robert Bosch engineer Gottlob Honold in 1902 enabled the development of an internal combustion engine

 The retrospective internal combustion engine can be divided into two forms, the spark ignition engine that needs a spark plug to start combustion, and the compression ignition engine that compresses the air and then pours the diesel fuel into the hot compressed air mixture
 Is where it automatically ignites

 This plug is connected to a high voltage generated by an ignition coil or magneto
 jab electron taar se pravaahit hote hai, tab kendriya electrode or said electrode ke bich ek voltage antar viksit hota he
 No electricity flows because the fuel and air in the gap is an insulator, but as the voltage rises further, it begins to change the composition of the gases between the electrodes
 ek baar voltage ke gaison kii asanvahak shakti se adhik bad jane se, gaisen ynikrut ban jaati hai
 The ionized gas becomes a conductor and allows electrons to flow through the cracks

 They provide high power supply during the flow process resulting in hot and long duration sparks
 jab electronon kii dhara daraar main pravaahit hoti he, to vah spark channel ke taapmaana ko 60,000 k tak badha detii he
 The rapid heating of the spark channel expands the ionized gas rapidly like a small explosion
 yahi vah "clic" he jise ek chingaari ke saath suna jaataa he, jo bijli chamakane or garaj ke samaan he
 The heat and pressure force the gases to react with each other, and at the end of the spark event a small ball of fire appears in the spark crack when the gases burn by themselves

 Even after the ignition period is over, a small kernel drives the engine, and a larger kernel does this when the period goes forward
 ek spark plag ek khol, visanvahak or kendriya chaalak se bana hota he
 It penetrates into the combustion chamber wall and therefore the combustion chamber must be sealed without disturbances under prolonged and prolonged use against high pressure and temperature
 spark plag ke sheersh par prajvalan pranali se judane ke liye ek terminal hota he
 The exact terminal construction varies depending on the spark plug used
 adhikansh yatri car ke spark plag ke taar plag ke terminal par toote hote hai, lekin kuch taron main sped sambandhak hote hai jinhen ek nat ke neeche plag ke upar baandha jaataa he
 The plugs used for these applications often serve the dual purpose of the terminal end of a thin threaded shaft as a nut so that they can be used as both types of connections
 ye sab spark plag kaa ek aavashyak hissaa hai
 The main part of the insulator is made of ceramic
 iskaa pramukh kaary he kendriya electrode ke liye yantric sahaayta pradaan karnaa or saath hi saath ucch voltage ko visanvahit karnaa
 It also has a secondary role, particularly in modern engines with niche plugs, under which it extends the terminal above the cylinder head to make it more easily accessible

 Obstructed and long passages allow the power to withstand greater resistance near the surface of the spark plug, even in the presence of dust and moisture
 Some modern sparking plugs are not made with ribs
 visanvahak kii achaalak shakti main sudhaar unhen kam mahatvapurn banaata he
 The tip of the insulator, that is, the part from the metal body of the plug to the electrode that enters the combustion chamber, has to withstand high temperatures, creating electrical conduction
 ati-tapit hone se bachane ke liye electrode ko acchhee tapiya chaalakata pradaan kerani chahie
 The ceramics of the main insulator are inadequate and therefore a precipitated aluminum oxide ceramic is used, which is designed to withstand 650 ° c and 60,000 V

 In the late seventies, the development of the engine reached a stage where the 'heat limit' of conventional spark plugs with solid nickel alloy central electrodes was unable to adjust to their demands

 from the point of an edge and not the flat surface
 nukile electrode se electronon ko kheenchna sabase aasaan he lekin ek nukila electrode keval kuch second ke baad hi ghis jaataa he
 Instead, the electrons emit from the sharp edges of the electrode ends; When these edges deteriorate, the spark becomes weaker and less reliable

 Spark plugs are specially designed with a spark gap that can be adjusted by the technician at the time of placement of the spark plug, for which an easy method of sizing to bring or remove the ground electrode near the central electrode

 Gap of spark plugs in automobiles typically ranges between 
035 "-0

 lekin yah ingine par nirbhar kar saktaa he: nae spark plag ve -8 ingine ke liye pehle se hi gap vaale ho sakate hai, jahaan sabhi 8 plag ko bina parivartit kiye sthapit kiya jaataa he; lekin agar 6 silendar ingine main sthapit kiya jaae to sabhi plegon main punah gaping kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 a spark plug gap gauge is a disc with tilted edges, or round wires of exact diameter; The use of a filler gauge with flat blades instead of round wires, as in the distributor point or valve lash, will give incorrect results, due to the size of the spark plug electrode
 The simplest gauge is a collection of keys of different thicknesses that fit the desired gap and the gap is adjusted until the keys are properly seated
 In the case of current engine technology, which includes a universally solid-state ignition system and computerized fuel injection, the used gaps, carburetors, and breaker points are much larger than in the era of distributors to this extent
 That spark plug gauges of that era are so small that they cannot measure the gap of the current car
 gap samaayojan kaaphi mahatvapurn ho saktaa he or agar yah galat hota he to ingine kharaab chalegaa, yaa ekadam hi nahin chalegaa
 ek sankeern gap bahut chota yaa kamjor spark utpann kare jo eendhan-vaayu ke mishran ko prabhavi rup se naa prajvalit kar sake, jabaki ek gap jo bahut chaudaa he vah spark ko shuru hone se hi roak saktaa he
 However, the spark that occasionally fails to ignite the fuel – air mixture may not be seen directly, but will appear as a decrease in engine power and fuel efficiency
 spark plag gap ke saath mukhya mudde hai: a properly gaped plug is wide enough to burn when heated, but not so wide that it is missed at high speeds, causing friction of the cylinder, or rattle in the engine
 plag ke puraane hone ke saath or nok or hook, donon kii dhaatu ke ghisne ke saath, gap chaudaa hone lagata he, isliye anbhavi meconic aksar is gap ko ingine nirmaataa dwaara nirdisht nunatam antaraal par rakhte hai or naa ki nirdisht sweekaarya gap ke bich main, taaki plag badalane ke bich kii avadhi ko adhik se adhik lanbaa kiya ja sake
 On the other hand, since a larger gap gives a more "hot" or "thick" spark and increases the more reliable ignition of the fuel-air mixture, and because a new plug with a pointed edge at the central electrode is compared to the old, worn plug Sparks in a more reliable way, experienced mechanics also believe that the maximum gap specified by the engine manufacturer is the highest that can be used with older plugs
 Will spark reliably; It is therefore possible to set the plug to a greater width to ensure reliable ignition in more high performance applications and to relieve repeated plugging as soon as the tip is broken
 mul spark plag kii dizin par varshon se kiye ja rahe pareekshanon ke tahat behatar prajvalan, lanbaa jivan, yaa donon visheshtaon ko muhaiyyaa karaane kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 Such variations include the use of two, three, or four equally spaced ground electrodes that surround the central electrode
 anya roopon main ek dhanse hue kendriya electrode jo sparkplag dhaage se ghira hota he, jo prabhavi rup se ground electrode ban jaataa he kaa upyog shaamil he
 In addition there is the use of a V-shaped tooth at the tip of the ground electrode
 kai ground electrode aam taur par lanbaa jivan pradaan karte hai, kyonki jab vidyut pravaah kshati kii vajah se spark gap chaudaa hota he, tab spark ek anya kareebi ground electrode ke nazadik jaataa he
 The disadvantage of many ground electrodes is that a shielding effect can occur in the engine combustion chamber causing the flame to be interrupted when the fuel air mixture is ignited

 Hence a new type of "surface discharge" plug was developed for Wankel

 laabh yah he ki plag, tip sil ke bas neeche lagata he jo uske upar se guzarati he, jisase spark ke liye eendhan / hawa mishran sulabh bana rahata he
 The "plug gap" remains the same throughout its life; And the spark route varies continuously

 If the force used to install the plug is not excessive, the washer can be reused at the time the plug is removed and reinstalled, although this practice is not recommended if strictly spoken, and replacement
 Washers are available

 These plugs took more force to install and remove and were easier to break if applied by partially removing the wrench from the axle
 haal hi main, ford fiesta ke kuch prakaaron main or kaa main samaan ceiling vyavastha thi
 The force required to install these plugs seems to be lower than the ones mentioned above and it is extremely important not to over tighten them, as they can be difficult or impossible to remove after tightening

 Ford has issued the TSB several times and reminded technicians to follow only the correct methods of installation
 plag ke threaded bhaag ko head kii motaai ke anusaar kareebi rup se milan kiya janaa chahie
 If a plug goes too far into the combustion chamber, it can hit the piston and damage the engine internally
 kam naatakeey rup se, agar plag ke dhaage dahan chember tak failte hai, to dhaage ke tikhe kinare taap ke bindu strot kaa kaam karte hai jo purv-prajvalan kaa kaaran ban sakate hai; iske alaava, khule dhaage ke bich kaa jamaav plag ko hataane ko mushkil bana saktaa he or hataane kii kriya main aluminium head par dhaage ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 The spread of the tip in the chamber also affects the plug performance, however, the more centrally the spark plug is located, the better the ignition of the air-fuel mixture, although experts believe that the process is actually more More complex and dependent on the size of the combustion chamber
 duusari ore, agar ek ingine "jalataa tel" he, to dahan chember main atirikt tel risaav plag tip ko kharaab kar saktaa he or spark ko roktaa he; aise maamalon main, ingine kii tulana main kam failaav vaala ek saamaanya plag kaa istemaal kiya jayega jo aksar kam kharabi utpann karata he lambe samay tak behatar pradarshan karata he
 In fact, special "anti-dirty" adapters are also sold that fit between the plug and the head and reduce the spread of the plug for just this reason, used in older engines with severe oil combustion problems; This may make the ignition of the air fuel mixture less effective, but in such cases, it is of less importance
 ek spark plag kaa sanchaalan taapmaana, chalate ingine ke bheetar spark plag kii nok kaa vaastavik bhautik taapmaana he
 It is determined by many factors, but mainly by the actual temperature within the combustion chamber
 spark plag ke vaastavik sanchaalan taapmaana or spark voltage ke bich koi sidhaa sambandh nahin he
 The current level of the torque produced by the engine, however, will strongly affect the operating temperature of the spark plug as the maximum temperature and pressure occurs when the engine works close to the peak torque
 visanvahak kaa taapmaana thermal kii sthiti yah karne ke liye dahan kaksh main saamne aa rahaa he lekin thik iske vipareet pratikriya karata he
 If the tip of the spark plug is too hot, it can cause pre-ignition or sometimes detonation / knock and damage

 a spark plug will be called "hot" if it is a better heat insulator and carries more heat to the tip of the spark plug
 ek spark plag ko tab "thanda" kaha jayega agar vah spark plag tip se adhik taap kaa chaalan karata he or tip ke taap ko kam karata he
 a spark plug is "hot" or "cold", this is known as the heat range of the spark plug
 ek spark plag kii taap seemaa ko aamtaur par ek sankhya ke rup main nirdisht kiya jaataa he, jahaan kuch nirmaataa garm plag ke liye arohi number kaa upyog karte hai or anya iskaa vipareet karte hai, thande plag ke liye arohi number kaa upyog
 The heat range of a spark plug is influenced by the construction of the spark plug: the material used, the length of the insulator and the surface area of the plug within the combustion chamber
 For general use, the selection of the spark plug heat range is a balance under which the tip is kept warm in ideal conditions so as not to deteriorate and is kept too cold at maximum power to prevent pre-ignition or engine nailing
 ek hi nirmaataa dwaara banaae gaye "garm" or "thande" spark plag ko agal-bagal rakh kar muyna karne se isamen shaamil siddhant ko spasht rup se samajha ja saktaa he; thande plag main kam paryaapt chini mitti kaa kendriya electrode hota he or khol ke bich kii khai ko bharne visanvahak he, jo gap ko bharti he, jabaki garm plag main zyada ceremic saamagree hoti he, taaki tip, plag ke sharir se pruthak rahe or taap ko behatar barkaraar rakhe
 Heat from the combustion chamber emits through exhaust gases and from the side walls of the cylinder and also from the spark plug itself
 The heat limit of a spark plug only has one minute effect on the combustion chamber and overall engine temperature
 ek thandi plag vastav main ek chalate ingine ke taapmaana ko kam nahin karegaa
 Rather, the main effect of a "hot" or "cold" plug is to affect the temperature of the tip of the spark plug

 a stopped engine will have a different impact on the spark plugs than when running at full throttle
 Spark plug readings are only valid for engines with the most recent operating conditions, and running the engine under different conditions may obscure or erase the previous characteristic marks on the spark plug

 In any event, this is achieved by marking the location of the gap outside the plug, installing, and taking into account the direction of the mark; The plug is then removed and additional washers are added to change the orientation of the tightened plug

 In all societies there is a tradition of mentoring and receiving counseling
 chaahe do vikalpon main ek chayan kii samasya ho, kisi bhi prakaar ke bhram kii sthiti ho, athwa maansik tanaav ho, paraamarsh aavashyak or aprihaary ho jaataa he
 At least two persons are involved in counseling, one being a counselor or consultant and the other receiving counseling
 vyakti apni nijee samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye paraamarsh chahta he
 Personal problems can be physical, mental, occupational and social related, for which he needs a counselor
 paraamarsh multah parsparik hota he
 The basis of this belief is tradition
 vyakti paraamarsh usee se letaa he jisamen uskaa vishwaas hota he or yadi paramarshak sachcha, eemaandaar or sannishth he to vah usee vyakti ko paraamarsh detaa he jise vah samajhataa he ki vah paraamarsh ko sweekaar karegaa or yatha sambhav iskaa paalan karegaa
 EWW Mayes, a noted writer who has made major contributions in the field of professional direction, has written that mentoring is a great art, thus the counselor should consult with great care and caution
 paramarshak ko anbhavi, sudhi, sajag or paripakv hona chahie jiskaa laabh pratyaashee ko mil sake
 In the early days of the formation of society, consultation was neither systematic nor scientific
 isaki koi prakriya nahin thi
 It also had no form
 paramarshak paraamarsh dene ke purv kisi prakaar kii taiyaari bhi nahin karata tha or na kisi nishchit lakshya ko dhyaan main rakh kar paramarshechhu paraamarsh kii aakanksha karata tha
 The format of counseling also changed with the times
 jis prakaar se vibhinn shastron evam vigyaanon, main naveen avadharana, prakriya tathaa vyavastha kaa samavesh hua usee prakaar paraamarsh bhi usase achoota nahin rahaa he
 According to Hermine- Counseling is a psychological relationship in which an applicant receives direct help from a counselor or an opportunity to reduce negative emotions and pave the way for positive growth in personality
 myrs ne likhaa he- paraamarsh se abhipraay do vyaktiyon ke bich sambandh he jisamen ek vyakti duusare vyakti ko ek vishesh prakaar kii sahaayta karata he
 Willie and André said that counseling is a process of mutual learning
 isamen do vyakti sammilit hote he sahaayta praapt karne vaala or doosraa prashikshit vyakti jo pratham vyakti kii sahaayta is prakaar karata he ki uskaa adhiktam vikaas ho saken
 Brewer described counseling as negotiation, discussion and friendly conversation
 paraamarsh kii safalataa isaki moolbhoot avadharana se hi sambandhit he
 AJ Jones has stated the four basic assumptions necessary for its success
