 Critical theory is the ideological community in which a critical review and evaluation of society and culture is made with the knowledge gained from the study of sociology and humanities

 Sociologists associated with the ideology of critical theory are often considered to be Marxists, although they differ from some elements of Marxism and believe that faith in ideologies is the main reason for human liberation
 manorog vigyaan yaa manorog vidya chikitsa kshetra kii ek visheshgyata he jo manovikaron kaa adhyayan karti he
 Psychology is a new science of the modern era
 20veen sadi main hi is vigyaan ke vibhinn angon main mahatv kii khojein hui hai
 Till the 19th century, various types of psychosis were considered diseases that had no relation to the general practitioner
 jatil manovikar kii avasthaa main rogi ko maansik chikitsaalayon main rakh diya jaataa tha, taaki vah samaaj ke duusare logon kaa koi nuksaan na kar sake
 There was no special treatment in these hospitals
 chikitsakon ko vastav main uski chikitsa ke vishay main spasht gyaan hi na tha ki chikitsa kaise kii jaay
 Now the situation has changed
 manovikar vigyaan ko ek andhiyaari kothri nahin maan liya gaya he, jiskaa sambandh thode se manoveekshipt logon se he, varan yah vigyaan itnaa mahatv kaa vishay mana gaya he ki iskaa samuchit gyaan na keval kushal shaareerik chikitsak ko, varan samaaj ke prayek sevak or kaaryakarta, shikshak, samajasudharak tathaa raajnneetik netaa ko bhi hona aavashyak he
 Not only this, every well-educated citizen also needs its knowledge
 yadi koi prabal manovikar man main aa gaya or hamen uskaa gyaan nahin hua, to ham usase mukt hone ke liye kisi visheshgy kii sahaayta bhi na le sakenge
 Any person, who is perfectly healthy and whose wisdom is praised by all people, can become deranged by losing the balance of his mind at any time
 phir vah samaaj ke liye nikamma ho jaataa he
 a person should know such situations so that he does not fall into some kind of extraordinary mental state, that is, he does not suffer from mental illness
 phir maansik chikitsa karaane ke liye bhi manovikar vigyaan main shraddha hona aavashyak he
 Psychological science developed to meet the special needs of humans
 yah 20veen shatabdi kii ek vishesh dein kaa parinaam he
 In this century, there has been an unthinkable increase in the efficiency and happiness of human beings
 uski taarkik shakti or vaigyanik chamatkaar atyadhik bad gaye hai
 Along with this, his mental activities have increased many times already
 yah kori bakawaad nahin hai ki pratibha or paagalpan ek duusare ke poorak hai
 Along with intellectual development, dementia also develops
 vigyaan sukhad samagriyon main vruddhi karata he, to du:khad paristhitiyon kaa bhi srijan karata he
 It creates a new mental confusion as well as a reconciliation of external conditions
 ek ore vigyaan manushya kii suraksha badha detaa he, to duusari ore achintya chintaaon ko bhi utpann kar detaa he
 Therefore, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the 20th century is a century of insanity
 yadi isane veikshiptata ko badhaayaa he, to uske shaman ke vishesh upaay khojna bhi isi kaa kaam he
 As much as the country is progressing in civilization, there are more anti-cancer doctors and hospitals in it
 atev manovikaron ke nivaaran hetu anek prakaar kii manovaigyanik khojein maanavvigyaan ke vibhinn kshetron main ho rahi he
 Before Dr
 Freud, doctors used to use only physical medicines for the treatment of mental diseases
 kuch log in rogon ko shant karne ke liye tantropchaar kaa upyog karte the
 Belief and instruction are the basis of mechanism
 aaj bhi is vidhi kaa upyog gramin ashikshit logon main adhiktar hota he
 The famous Belgian psychologist Dr
 Messmer made extensive use of hypnosis and instruction in the treatment of mental diseases
 isse manojaat shaareerik rogon kaa bhi nivaaran hota tha
 Scholars named Braun Heim and Sharco of France showed the usefulness of Sammohan in monsoon
 rogi apni sanmohit avasthaa main dabi maansik bhaavana ko ugal detaa tha or is prakaar ke rechan se vah rogamukt bhi ho jaataa tha
 Dr
 Emile Couyé of Nenson, France, used instruction in the treatment of mental diseases, but not all these methods led to a special advancement of psychiatry
 iske liye man kaa gambhir prayogtmak adhyayan karnaa aavashyak tha
 This work was done by Dr
 Freud
 ab yah mana jane laga ki man kii vibhinnataaon kaa gyaan kiye bina or unamem chalanevaali prakriyaaon ke jane bina kisi bhi vyakti ko uske manovikar se mukt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 According to Dr
 Freud there are three levels of the mind: conscious, subconscious and unconscious
 man teen prakaar ke kaary bhi karata he : ichchhaaon kaa nirmaan, unka niyantran or unki santushti
 The first work is of the dependent mind, the second work is of the moral mind and the third work is of the ego
 ichchhaaon kaa janm praaia: achetan str par hota he, unka niyantran avchetan par or unki santushti chetan str par hoti he
 Conflict often goes on in the human mind and moral mind
 jab yah sangharsh manushya kii chetana main chalata he, tab vah du:khadaayak chaahe jitna bhi ho par rog kaa kaaran nahin banataa, kintu jab prayatnpurvak kathorta se kisi prabal ichha kaa daman naitik man ke dwaara ho jaataa he, tab sangharsh maansik chetana ke str par na hokar manushya ke achetan man main hone lagata he
 The existence of this struggle is mental disease and freeing the person from this struggle is his mental therapy, which is the goal of psychiatry
 iske liye rogi ko maansik shithilikaran kii avasthaa main laayaa jaataa he or phir use apane apriy athwa aniatik anubhavon ko samaran karne kaa nirdesh diya jaataa he
 For this, some people still use the Sammohan method, but Freud used to psychoanalyze the patient
 is vidhi main rogi ko shant or shithil avasthaa main laakar man main aanevaale sabhi vichaaron or chitron ko kehete jane ke liye kaha jaataa he
 In this way, sometimes the patient tells very unpleasant experiences
 jab ve anubhav puure sajiv ho jate hai or rogi unke anusaar lajja, glani, harsh, vishaad kaa usee prakaar anubhav karata he, jaisaa pehali baar kiya tha, tab uske bhaavon kaa rechan ho jaataa or rog ke anek lakshan samaapt ho jate hai
 The patient does not benefit from blank intellectual memory, but from living memory of old experiences, that is, emotional memory
 jab kisi damit bhav kaa rechna hota he, tab vah pehle pahal maansik chikitsak par hi aropit ho jaataa he
 It is absolutely necessary for the patient to have affection towards the doctor to come out of the feeling
 jab tak rogi or chikitsak main hriday kii ekta nahin hoti, damit ichha avchetana ke str par aati hi nahin
 Then this affection increases day by day
 jaise jaise chikitsak par rogi kii shraddha badhati jaati he, uskaa rog kam hota jaataa he
 While getting rid of his disease, the patient loves the doctor very much
 is pyaar kaa badhanaa or rogamukti ek hi tathy ke do pahalu hai
 Now it is the duty of the physician to turn the impulse of the love of the patient to its proper character, or to use it in some constructive work
 chikitsak rogi ko bhavatmak rachanaavlamban praapt karaane kaa prayaas karata rahata he
 He encourages him to increase his knowledge
 rogi ko rogamukt tabhi samajha ja saktaa he, jab vah na keval rog ke sabhi lakshanon se mukt ho gaya ho, varan use bhavatmak swaavlamban or aatm sujh praapt ho gaye hon
 Psychology is the means to attain this mood
 maansik chikitsavigyaan kii nai khojein manovigyaan ke atirikt duusari dishaao main bhi hui hai
 There are two main among these: maansik rogi ke man main sangharsh chalate rahane ke kaaran vah anidra kaa shikaar ho jaataa he
 Now if such a person is put to sleep in any way, then it is possible that his disease becomes light
 maansik rogi ko do sthalon par sadaa ladate rahanaa padataa he, ek bhitari or duusari bahari
 He has external and internal worries
 iske kaaran vah asaadhaaran rukaawat kaa anubhav karata he
 This causes him to lose sleep
 neend ke kho jane se uski thakaavat or bhi bad jaati he or phir vah paagalpan kii sthiti main aa jaataa he
 If she starts feeling sleepy, then her mental strength will get accumulated and she will be able to solve her external problems
 iske baad uski bhitari samasyaon kii bhayankarta bhi kam ho jaati he
 Therefore, whichever patient can make the patient sleep, it is beneficial for him
 iske liye bhartiya ayuvedic oshadhi sarpgandha he, yaa allopathic vidhi se bani nidra laanevaali tikia hai
 a person suffering from complex mental diseases is sometimes brought to unconscious state
 iske liye use insulin kaa injection diya jaataa he
 After giving it, the patient flings around and expresses physical cramps
 baar baar injection dene par rogi kii tod phod, marpet kii pravriti shant ho jaati he
 His mind is in a state of relaxation
 isse phir rogi swaabhaavik rup se swasthya laabh karata he
 Similar treatment is also done by electric shaking
 inase rogi ko ardhachetan athwa achetan avasthaa main laayaa jaataa he
 His efforts symbolically repel repressed emotions
 jatil rogiyon ke upachaar main praaia: bijli ke jhatkon se hi kaam liya jaataa he
 When they were first used, there was great hope from this treatment method, but all these hopes were not fulfilled
 kuch maansik rogon kii chikitsa prakritik dhang se bhi hoti he
 When the patient abandons his complex work and starts feeling relaxed in nature, then he gets mental equilibrium automatically
 hamaari vartmaan sabhyataa main saamaajik tanaav ke avasar atyadhik bad gaye hai
 When a man abandons his normal routine and starts to give rest to his mind, then he gets well
 da yung ke kathanusaar rog manushya ko aaraam kii aavashyaktaa darshane ke liye aata he
 He teaches her the lesson of subduing her desires
 edward karcenter ke anusaar hamaari vartmaan sabhyataa hi maansik rog he
 It removes us from natural life
 yah hamaari ichchhaaon ko itnaa badha detii he ki unki purti main ham sadaa apane aapako dubo dete hai
 The method by which these vain desires are lacking, is the best remedy for mental health
 atev prakritik jivan maanas-rog-nivaaran kaa uttam upaay he
 Psychological science not only has a place of natural life, but also of religion
 anek maansik vikaar trishna kii vruddhi se or sanyam kii kami se utpann hote hai
 Religion inhibits the growth of craving and increases restraint
 atev vah anek prakaar ke manovikaron ko paidaa hi nahin hone detaa
 Secondly, religion is essentially related to literature and art
 inke dwaara manushya kii nimna koti kii ichchhaaon kaa udasikaran hota rahata he
 Due to this, there is no conflict between these desires and moral intelligence of man and there is no opportunity for the formation of mental glands
 manovikar vigyaan is prakaar hamaari drushti maanav samaaj main prachlit jivan ke un puraane tareekon or mulyon kii ore pher detaa he, jinke hraas ke kaaran manushya ko anek prakaar ke maansik klesh bhogane padate hai
 The social values and culture that will be built with the help of this knowledge will provide permanent health to the life of man
 isi aashaa se is vigyaan kaa vistaar na keval maansik chikitsakon dwaara ho rahaa he, varan sabhi samaaj-kalyaan-chintakon dwaara ho rahaa he
 Psychiatry in India is still in a less developed state
 manorogon ke bare main aam vyakti kii jaankaree galat dharanaon se bhari he
 Even in today's scientific era, ghosts, upper shadows, deities, weather, constellations, luck, fruits of bad deeds etc
 are considered to be the cause of these diseases
 isliye ojha, pujari, maulavee, sadhu, nakli vaidya, neem-hakim, aprashikshit yon-visheshgy ityadi avaigyanik rup se manorog chikitsakon kaa kaary kar rahe hai
 General practitioners and medical specialists are often unable to identify psychiatrists at the right time and send patients to the psychiatrist
 iske kai kaaran hai; jinke pramukh hai : dhan lolupata, aparyaapt jaankaree, aparyaapt prashikshan, manochikitsakon kii kami, garibi, rogi yaa uske rishtedaaron dwaara manorog ko sweekaar na karnaa, aadi
 Newspapers and other media have also failed to give accurate information about the psychiatrists
 parinamswaroop logon main in rogon ke bare main dar va agyanta kii galat dharanaen dur nahin hui hai
 There are only about 4000 psychiatric doctors in India with more than 100 crore population
 yah sankhya bahut kam he
 There are 42 psychiatric hospitals in India with about twenty thousand beds
 haal hi main sabhi sarkari aspataalon main manorog chikitsa pradaan karne kii yojana banaayi gayi he taaki manorogiyon ko saamaanya aspataalon main hi chikitsa pradaan kii ja sake

 It is known that this book was written before the famous playwright Bhavabhuti of the seventh century CE, because Bhavabhuti in his play 'malatimadhava' has given the name 'kamandaki' of Nitiaprayoganipuna a Parivrajika

 He saves the drowning Elizabeth, but Nourinton learns of Jack's reality and arrests him

 The fencing erupts between the two, but eventually Jack is knocked unconscious and imprisoned for hanging

 In the battle, Elizabeth is caught but survives by calling the law of "conversation"
 vah padak ke badale port royal ko bakhshane kaa sauda karti he or captain barbosa ko apana jhootha naam turnar bataati he
 Barbossa agrees, but discovers a flaw in the deal and imprisons Elizabeth, thinking that she is the key to getting rid of the curse

 But Jack escaped after three days and even after ten years he has saved the bullet so that he can land it in Barbossa's chest
 luteron ne azetek kaa sona lutaa diya par baad main unhe us par lage shraap kaa pataa chalaa jo raat ko unhe nar-kankalon main badal detaa tha
 The curse can be broken only after collecting all the coins and putting the blood of every robber on it
 butstap bill, jaik kaa akelaa samarthak, ne ek sikaa apane bete bill ko bhej diya, yah soch kar ki barbosa or uskaa karmidal shraap ke laayak he
 Barbossa then tied Bill with a cannon and threw it into the sea, but he later learned that he would need blood too; And now he is looking for the last remaining turner for the same work
 isla di murta par barbosa yah soch kar ki elizabeth butstap bill kii beti he, aakhri sikke ko uske khun se rang kar sandook main gira detaa he par shraap phir bhi nahin tuutata
 Upon arriving on the island, Will feels that Jack will betray him and he makes Jack unconscious

 Jack deals with Barbossa to exchange Bill Turner's last child in exchange for Pearl

 vil ko isla di murta le jaaya jaataa he jahaan barbosa use markar shraap todne kaa iraadaa bana letaa he
 On the deserted island, Elizabeth discovers how Jack had escaped from there; He was the liquor hideout of the island liquor smugglers and Jack escaped by bargaining with them

 She accepts Nourinton's marriage proposal on the condition that she save Will's life

 He advises him not to break the curse until he and the Dauntless ship of Norinton take over
 jaik kaa plan vifal ho jaataa he jab barbosa apane karmidal ko jalmagn hokar dontles par chadhai karne kaa hukum detaa he
 Elizabeth arrives at the Pearl to rescue Jack's crew, hoping that they will all help him, but he leaves with the Pearl, and Elizabeth leaves alone to help Will

 Seeing Nourinton attacking his ship, he orders his crew to return
 jahaaz par pahunchakar vah shaapit luteron se lad passage he
 On the other hand, Jack shoots Barbossa as he proceeds to kill Elizabeth
 barbosa ko lagata he ki jaik ne goli barabaad kar di par tabhi vil apane khun se sanaa aakhri sikaa sandook main gira kar shraap tod detaa he
 Barbossa is killed as the curse breaks and the robbers who returned to normal at Dauntless surrender
 port royal par jaik ko sazaaye maut di ja rahi hoti he par vil aakar use bachaa letaa he or jald hi dono gher liye jate he
 Seeing this, Norinton reminds Will of his will, to which Will and Elizabeth tell him that it is between him and Jack
 jaik peeche kii ore khadi main gir jaataa he or tair kar nae marammat kiye gaye blike parl par batch nikalataa he
 Will gets an apology and is also allowed to marry Elizabeth
 jaik ke bare main puchhne par naurinton use ek din kii badhat dene kii baat karata he taaki vah waapas use pakadney nikal saken
 Despite Jack's promise to deliver the ship, Anamaria hands him the command of Pearl

 Finally, after the titles, Barbosa's monkey, also named Jack, takes out a coin from the chest and pounces on the camera as a skeleton

 Indian authorities have interpreted the law that a person cannot hold a passport from another country if he has an Indian passport - even in the case of a child who is claimed to be his citizen by another country and such It may be that the laws of that country require that child's passport to travel abroad - and Indian courts have given the car Binding branch has wide discretion
 isliye, bharat kii videshi naagarikta bharat kii purna naagarikta nahin he or is prakaar se yah dohari naagarikta yaa dohari rashtriyata ko asweekaar karata he

 An interesting question is that a person registered as a foreign national of India will lose the right to diplomatic protection of his country while living in India
 Article 4 of the Hague Convention on specific questions related to the conflict of nationality law of 1930 states that " a state cannot provide diplomatic protection to a person against a state whose nationality is also held by such persons
 Depends on the subjects: First, whether the Government of India considers the foreign citizenship of India as true citizenship and on this basis the right of diplomatic protection by another country ceases; and second, whether the individual's own country recognizes it and Accepts India's rejection
 donon hi bindu sandigdh hai
 India does not provide an independent travel document to foreign nationals but instead places a visa in another country's passport
 yadi vyakti keval duusare desh kaa passport rakhane ke liye paatr he parantu bhartiya yatra dastavej ke kisi bhi rup ko nahin rakh saktaa, to is nishkarsh se batch paanaa mushkil he ki vah vyakti rajanyik sangrakshan ke prayojan ke liye anya desh kaa ekmaatr naagarik he
 On obtaining foreign citizenship of India, British citizens cannot register as full British citizens under Section 4B of the British Nationality Act of 1981
 This does not prevent them from obtaining full British citizenship in a different way and it does not revoke their British citizenship if they are already registered under Section 4B

 kuch virus jo saamaanya zukaam ke kaarak hote hai ve mausami hote hai or thande yaa geele mausam ke dauraan inke hone kii aavriti adhik hoti he
 It is believed that this is mainly due to staying indoors for a long time and near the infected person; Especially children who return to school however, it may also be related to changes in the respiratory system that result in mild infections

 veydant gyanayog kii ek shakha he jo vyakti ko gyaan prapti kii disha main utprerit karata he
 Its main source is the Upanishads, which are considered to be the essence of Vedas and Aranyak texts
 upanishad vaidic sahitya kaa antim bhaag he, isiilie isko veydant kehete hai
 The description of rituals and worship is mainly in mantras and Brahmins, knowledge is interpreted in Upanishads
 'veydant' kaa shabdic arth he - 'vedon kaa ant' 
 The three branches of Vedanta that are most well known are: Advaita Vedanta, Specific Advaita and Dvaita
 aadi shankaracharya, ramanuj or shri madhwacharya jinako kramash: in tino shakhaon kaa pravartak mana jaataa he, inke alaava bhi gyanayog kii anya shakhaayen hai
 These branches are known as their promoters, including Bhaskar, Vallabh, Chaitanya, Nimbaraka, Vachaspati Mishra, Sureshwar and Vigyan Bhikshu
 aadhunik kaal main jo pramukh vedanti huye hai unamem ramakrishna paramhans, swami vivekanand, arvind ghosh, swami shivanand raja rammohan roy or raman maharishi ullekhneey hai
 These modern thinkers represent the Advaita Vedanta branch
 duusare vedanto ke pravartakon ne bhi apane vichaaron ko bharat main bhalibhanti prachaarit kiya he parantu bharat ke baahar unhen bahut kam janaa jaataa he
 'vedanta' literally means 'the end of the Vedas'
 armbh main upanishdon ke liye ‘veydant’ shabd kaa prayog hua kintu baad main upanishdon ke siddhanton ko aadhaar maanakar jin vichaaron kaa vikaas hua, unke liye bhi ‘veydant’ shabd kaa prayog hone laga
 Three reasons are often given for the use of the word 'vedanta' for the Upanishads: - acharya udaiveer shastri ke anusaar ‘veydant’ pad kaa taatpary he- It has been said above that the word 'vedanta' was originally used for the Upanishads
 alag-alag samhitaon tathaa unki shakhaon se sambaddh anek upanishad hamen praapt hai
 The main and ancient ones are - Ish, Cane, Kath, Mundak, Mandukya, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Chandogya and Brihadaranyaka
 in upanishdon ke darshanik siddhanton main kaaphi kuch samanta he kintu anek sthanon par virodh bhi prathit hota he
 Over time, the need was felt that unanimous teachings should be compiled by co-ordinating the ideas which seem to be opposing
 isi aavashyaktaa kii purti ke liye baadaraayan vyas ne brahmasutra kii rachana kii jise veydant sutara, sharirakasutra, sharirakamimasaa yaa uttarmimasaa bhi kaha jaataa he
 In it, the principles of the Upanishads have been compiled very briefly, in formulaic form
 atyadhik sankshep hone ke kaaran sutron main apane aap main aspashtataa he or unhen bina bhashya yaa tikaa ke samajhnaa sambhav nahin he
 That is why many commentators tried to clarify their intentions by their respective languages, but they had their own viewpoints in this explanation and that is why they differ enough
 prayek ne yah siddh karne kii cheshtaa kii ki uskaa bhashya hi brahmasutron ke vaastavik arth kaa spashtikaran karata he
 As a result, all the commentators became promoters of the Vedanta sect
 inamen pramukh he shankar kaa advaitvaad, ramanuj kaa vishishtadvaitvaad, madhv kaa dwaitvaad, nimbark kaa dwaitadvaitvaad tathaa vallabh kaa shuddhadvaitvaad
 Within these languages, there was a series of commentaries on these languages and commentaries on these languages
 apane-apane sampradaay ke mat ko pusht karne ke liye anek swatantra granthon kii bhi rachana hui, jinase veydant kaa sahitya atyant vishaal ho gaya
 Historically, for a teacher to become / understand Acharya, he has to write commentaries or commentaries on the books of Vedanta
 in pustakon main teen mahatvapurn pustak shaamil hai upanishad, bhagavad gita or brahmasutra, jinhen prasthaantrayee kehete hai
 Accordingly, Adi Shankaracharya, Ramanuja and Madhvacharya have all given specific compositions on these three important books
 teenon granthon main pragat vichaaron kaa kai tarah se vyaakhyaan kiya ja saktaa he
 For this reason, many opinions regarding Brahm, Jiva and Jagat were presented and in this way many forms of Vedanta were created
 gaudpad tathaa unke anuvarthi aadi shankaracharya brahm ko pradhan maanakar jeev or jagat ko usase abhinn maanate hai
 According to him the element should be devoid of origin and destruction
 nashvan jagat tatvashoonya he, jeev bhi jaisaa dikhaai detaa he vaisaa tatvat: nahin he
 In the awakened and self-awakening, the living organism lives in the world, but in sleep, the living entity remains in a conscious state
 isse siddh hota he ki jeev kaa shuddh rup sushupti jaisaa hona chahie
 The state of sleep is impermanent, so beyond this, Turiyavastha is considered pure form of life
 is avasthaa main nashwar jagat se koi sambandh nahin hota or jeev ko pun: nashwar jagat main pravesh bhi nahin karnaa padataa
 This Turiyavastha derives from practice
 brahm-jeev-jagat main abhed kaa gyaan utpann hone par jagat jeev main tathaa jeev brahm main leen ho jaataa he
 Despite the real imperviousness of the three, the organism considers the world separate from itself due to ignorance
 parantu swapnsansar kii tarah jaagrath sansar bhi jeev kii kalpana he
 The only difference is that the dream is the result of personal imagination, while the awakened experience - the macro - past superconception
 swapnjagat kaa gyaan hone par donon main mithyaatv siddh he
 But like the Buddhists, in Vedanta the creature is not considered false due to being part of the world
 mithyaatv kaa anubhav karanevaala jeev param satya he, use mithyaa maanane par sabhi gyaan ko mithyaa maananaa hoga
 But the form in which an organism behaves in the world is false
 jeev kii turiyavastha bhedagyaan shunya shuddhavastha he
 The relation of the knower-known-knowledge is a false relationship
 inase pare hokar jeev apni shuddh chetnavastha ko praapt hota he
 In this state there is not even a trace of difference because the distinction is in the duality
 isi advait avasthaa ko brahm kehete hai
 The element is infinite, if the second element is also there, then the limit of the first element will be limited and by being limited, that element will be intelligible in which the distinction of knowledge-knowledge-knowledge will be reflected
 anubhav sakshi he ki sabhi gyey vastuen nashwar hai
 Therefore, if we consider the element to be imperishable, then we have to consider it to be invisible, unknowable, pure consciousness
 aise tatv ko maanakar jagat kii anubhuymaan sthiti kaa hamen vivartvaad ke sahaar vyaakhyaan karnaa hoga
 Like the serpent reverberating in the rope, this world is neither true nor discrete
 sat hota to iskaa kabhi naash na hota, asat hota to sukh, du:kha kaa anubhav na hota
 Therefore, the unique unconditional state can be the actual state from the seventh discrete
 upanishdon main neti kahkar isi agyatavastha kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 Ignorance is a form of feeling because it leads to the achievement of the existence of an object, it is a form of absence, because its actual form is nothing
 isi agyaan ko jagat kaa kaaran mana jaataa he
 The exact answer to what ignorance has to do with Brahma is difficult, but Brahma in its pure formless ignorance is not without ignorance, somehow he becomes enlightened by eccentric ignorance to be called a virtuous God and thus the universe becomes active
 ishwar ko apane shuddh rup kaa gyaan hota he parantu jeev ko apane brahmroop kaa gyaan praapt karne ke liye sadhana ke dwaara brahmibhoot hona padataa he
 On hearing the sermon of 'tattvamsi' from the mouth of the Guru, the creature experiences 'aham Brahmasmi'
 us avasthaa main sampurna jagat ko aatmamay tathaa apane main sampoorn jagat ko dekhtaa he kyonki us samay uske ke atirikt koi tatv nahin hota
 This state is called Turiyavastha or Moksha
 ramanujacharya ne shankar mat ke vipareet yah kaha ki ishwar swatantra tatv he parantu jeev bhi satya he, mithyaa nahin
 These creatures are associated with God
 unka yah sambandh bhi agyaan ke kaaran nahin he, vah vaastavik he
 Even if there is salvation, the organism remains independent
 bhautik jagat or jeev alag alag rup se satya hai parantu ishwar kii satyata inaki satyata se vilakshan he
 Brahma is complete, the world is rooted, the creature is surrounded by ignorance and sorrow
 ye teenon milakar ekaakaar ho jate hai kyonki jagat or jeev brahm ke sharir hai or brahm inaki aatma tathaa niyantaa he
 They do not exist apart from Brahma, they are only there to serve Brahma
 is darshan main advait kii jagah bahutv kii kalpana he parantu brahm anek main ekta sthapit karanevaala ek tatv he
 Due to the rendering of the unique Advaha Brahman by the plurality, it is called the Vividhavaita
 vishishtadvait mat main bhedarahit gyaan asambhav mana gaya he
 That is why Shankar's pure Adva Brahm is not acceptable in this view
 brahm savishesh he or uski visheshta isamen he ki usamen sabhi sat gun vidyaman hai
 Therefore, Brahma is actually a physical God
 sabhi vaiyaktik atmaaen satya hai or inhen se brahm kaa sharir nirmit he
 It does not dissolve in Brahman, on salvation
 Their existence remains intact
 is tarah brahm anekta main ekta sthapit karanevaala sutara he
 This Brahm is situated in the causal form with the subtle and spirits in the Holocaust period, but takes a subtle physical form in the universe
 yahi kaary brahm kaha jaataa he
 The Brahman with infinite knowledge and bliss is called Narayana who resides in Baikuntha along with Lakshmi
 bhakthi ke dwaara is narayan ke sameep pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 The best devotion derives from Narayana's offerings and is Bhagavad Gyanamaya
 bhakthi maarg main jati-varna-gat bhed kaa sthaan nahin he
 This is the highway to God for all
 madhv ne dwait veydant kaa prachaar kiya jisamen paanch bhedon ko aadhaar mana jaataa he- jeev ishwar, jeev jeev, jeev jagat, ishwar jagat, jagat jagat
 The distinction among them is proven automatically
 bhed ke bina vastu kii sthiti asambhav he
 The world and creatures are separate from God but controlled by God
 sagun ishwar jagat kaa srashta, paalak or sanhaarak he
 The game of creation runs at the behest of God who is pleased with devotion
 yadhyapi jeev swabhaavat: gyaanamay or aanandamay he parantu sharir, man aadi ke sansarg se ise du:kha bhogana padataa he
 This occurs as a result of contact deeds
 jeev ishvarniyantrit hone par bhi karta or falbhokta he
 Devotion is eternal love in God, through which the creature is freed, situated near God, and has bliss
 bhautik jagat ishwar ke adheen he or ishwar kii ichha se hi sristi or pralay main yah kramash: sthool or sookshm avasthaa main sthit hota he
 Madhva, like Ramanuja, does not consider the creature and the world to be the body of Brahma
 ye swat:sthit tatv hai
 The difference between them is real
 ishwar keval inkaa niyantran karata he
 In this philosophy, Brahmo is the cause of the world, nature is the cause of gratitude
 nimbark kaa darshan ramanuj se atyadhik prabhavit he
 Jeeva is the form of knowledge and knowledge
 jeev or gyaan main dharmi-dharm-bhav-sambadh athwa bhedabhed sambandh mana gaya he
 This is the knower, the doer and the bhakta
