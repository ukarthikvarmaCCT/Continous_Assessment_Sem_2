 There is also evidence to suggest that Techichi may be earlier than Maya
 toltek par aztek dwaara vijay praapt kar lee gai, jinka maananaa tha ki techi main rahasyamay shaktiyaan hoti hai
 In terms of size, the current Chihuahua is much smaller than its ancestors, a change that is thought to have been caused by the introduction of small Chinese dogs, such as the crested Chinese dog, into South America by the Spanish

 Compared to other breeds, the nature of a Chihuahua depends greatly on how the genetic nature of its parents and grandparents was raised and how it has been raised and raised
 a Chihuahua should be chosen with great care , Because the nature of its owner can make a difference in the puppy's nature
 krodhi chihuahua ko hamalaa karne ke liye aasaani se uksaaya ja saktaa he or isliye ve aam taur par chote bacchon vaale gharon ke liye anupyukt hote hai

 " yah nasl kattarapurna ek vishesh maalik ke prati vafaadaar hoti he or kuch maamalon main us vyakti ko lekar vah ati surakshatmak ho jaati he, vishesh rup se anya vyaktiyon yaa pashuon ke aas-paas, lekin kai ke saath bhi jud sakati he
 They are not always friendly with other breeds, and have a "racist" nature, which makes them often prefer to live with other Chihuahua rather than other dogs
 ye lakshan aamtaur par unhen ghar ke liye anupyukt banaate hai jahaan bachche shant or dharyavan nahin hote
 Chihuahua are hungry for meditation, affection, exercise and affection
 ve atikriyasheel ho sakate hai, lekin khush hone ke liye utsuk rahete hai
 He has a reputation as a "yappy" dog, which can be resolved with proper training
 uchit prajnan vaale chihuahua "yappy" nahin hote; AKC maanak "terriar sadrush vyavhaar" kii maang karata he
 This breed requires specialist veterinary care such as childbirth and dental care
 Chihuahua are also sensitive to certain genetic anomalies, which are often neurological, such as seizure and epileptic disorders
 chihuahua or anya toy nasl, kabhi-kabhi dardanaak rog, hydrosephelus ke shikaar hote hai
 It is often diagnosed as having an abnormally large head during the first several months of the puppy's life, but other symptoms are more visible
 Chihuahua puppies that exhibit hydrocephalus usually have spots on the skull plates rather than solid bone and are generally dull and do not develop at the same speed as their siblings
 a true case of hydrocephalus can be diagnosed by a veterinarian, although the prognosis is severe
 chihuahua main molera hota he, yaa unki khopadi main ek naram sthaan hota he or kutton kii ve ekmaatr aisi nasl hai jo adhuri khopadi ke saath paidaa hote hai
 This molera fills with age, but considerable care is required during the first six months until the skull is fully formed
 Some moleras are not completely closed and require extra care to prevent injury
 kai pashuchikitsak, ek nasl ke rup main chihuahua se parichit nahin hai or galati se ek molera ko hydrosifelis samaj baithte hai
 The Chihuahua Club of America has released a statement related to this fatal misdiagnosis
 chihuahua par alpasharkrarktata yaa nune rakt sharkara kaa khatra bhi hota he, ve ekmaatr aise kute hai jinhen madhumeh hota he
 Blood sugar: This is especially dangerous for puppies
 yadi ilaaj na kiya jaae to alpasharkrarktata se coma yaa mrityu falit ho sakati he
 This disease can be fought by feeding continuously
 Chihuahua owners should keep a simple sugar supplement for use in emergencies, such as nutri-cal, caro syrup, or honey
 These supplements can be rubbed on the gums and roof of the mouth to increase the blood sugar level rapidly
 alpasharkrarktata ke lakshan main shaamil he susti, tandra, kam urja, ladkadhaate hue chalanaa, vikendrit drushti or gale kii mansapeshiyon kii anthan 
apni badi, gol, nikali hui ankhon or jameen se apekshaakrit kam unchai kii vajah se chihuahua ko netra sankraman yaa netra chot kaa khatra rahata he
 Care should be taken that a visitor or child does not give anything to his eyes
 ankhon main padane vaali dhul yaa allergy vaale tatwon ko hataane ke liye ankhon main pani aata rahata he
 Daily cleaning will keep the eyes clear and there will be no blurring in the eyes
 chihuahua main kaanpane kii pravriti mili he lekin yah ek swasthya mudda nahin he, balki yah tab hota he jab kutta tanaav main, uttejit hota he yaa use thand lagati he
 One reason for this may be that small dogs have a higher metabolism than larger dogs and therefore they blow heat faster
 is kaaran se chihuahua jab thand main baahar jate hai yaa adhik vaataanukoolit sthanon main jate hai to aksar kot yaa sweater pahante hai
 Chihuahuas often dig and lay in blankets to sleep
 haalanki aankade aksar bhinn paae jate hai, jaisaa ki kisi bhi anya nasl ke saath hota he, ek swasth chihuahua kaa ausat jivan kaal lagbhag 10 varsh se lekar 17 varsh tak hota he
 Chihuahua sometimes conduct electoral feedings and should be considered to provide adequate nutrition
 chihuahua ko yah pratishtha isliye mili kyonki ve din bhar bhojan ke chote tukade khoj lete hai
 Sometimes wet or fresh food imparts the most attractive odor to these frequent eaters
 "jab ve bhukhe hote hai tab ve khate hai" lagu nahin hota kyonki chihuahua alpasharkrarktata ke prati samvedansheel hote hai or yadi bhojan milane main lanbaa antaraal ho to unki sthiti kharaab ho sakati he
 At the same time, it should also be noted that they are not over-fed
 They should not give human food
 unke chote aakaar ke kaaran, thodaa bhi ucch vasa vaala yaa meetha khaadya chihuahua ke vajan ko adhik kar saktaa he
 Overweight Chihuahua is at risk of joint injuries, respiratory obstruction, chronic bronchitis and short life span
 chihuahua ko 'lucsetting patela' naamak ek anuvanshik haalat ke liye bhi janaa jaataa he
 It is a genetic condition that can occur in all dogs, old or young, thin or overweight dogs, especially in younger dogs
 In some dogs, the ridges forming the patellar grooves are not of the correct size and form a shallow groove
 uthle khaanche vaale kute main, patela bagal kii ore ukhd jaataa he, vishesh rup se andar kii ore
 isse pairon main bandhan hone lagata he or chihuahua apane pair ko jameen se upar uthaa kar rakhata he
 When the patella is dislocated from the groove of the femur, it usually does not return to its normal position until the quadriceps muscle relaxes and increases in length
 This is the reason why the affected dog is forced to lift its legs for a few minutes after the initial displacement
 jab mansapeshiyon main sankuchan hota he or patela apni sahi sthiti se ukhd jaataa he, to jod, ukhdi yaa mudi sthiti main rahata he
 Due to the surgical canal of the femur, a knee cap sliding across the femur can cause some pain

 The stories of both of them rekindle the war with the Persians in the battle of Thermopylae

 The filming work is done with the technique of highly superimposition chroma, which is virtually repeated with the help of pictures in the original comics book

 To maintain the excitement of this war, Queen Gorgo tries to get encouragement from the people of Sparta for her husband
 film main kathanaatmak ke taur par sparta sipaahi dilios kii aawaaj lee gai he
 It has become a historical mythological saga with the 300 people, along with various amazing creatures, in the film's narrative style
 film "300" ko bataur paaramparik donon tareekon se sanyukt raashtra ke imax thiyatron main march 09, 2007 or gharelu video ke taur par july 31, 2007 main dividi, blue-re discs evam echdi dividi ke rup main jari kiya gaya
 Despite its mixed response to the film, its original visual effects and style were greatly appreciated, but the overuse of the visual impact was greatly criticized for its lack of characterization and the ancient Persian Persians of Iran for their character being largely racist
 Hui; However, the film won 24th place in the biggest box office history of the century by showing its best appearance at the box office, doing more than $ 450 million business
 film kii agali siquil, 300: rij of en empire, jo miller kii hi aprakashit graphic upanyaas xerqies purvagam par aadhaarit he, ise march 7, 2014 main pradarshit kiya gaya
 In 479 BC, a year after the Battle of Thermopylae, Dilios, an ancient Sparta infantryman, narrates the story of Leonidas i from his childhood to being made king through Sparta customs
 dilios kii kahani jari rahati he, jiske mutabik ek farsi doot sparta kii dahalij par raja xerqies ke hukum se "jameen or pani" kii guzarish karata he, anyathaa inkaar kii surat main use coup kaa bhaajan banane kii dhamkee detaa he; sparta is prayuttar main doot or uske sipaahiyon ko laat markar andhe kune main gira daalata he
 Leonidas then goes to meet the pandas, priests called Effors, in order to explain the strategy that he can repel even the vast army of those Persians from the country border; According to the plan, he would build such a tight corridor wall that the Persians would be trapped by rocks and sea
 afars tab paraamarsh ke liye oracl kii bhavishyavaanee sunate hai, jo apana farmaan detaa he ki carnia ke vakt spartaon kaa yuddh par janaa sahi nahin hoga
 Frustrated and enraged, Leonidas returns, followed by a messenger of Zerkys, who rewards the enforcers for their camaraderie
 haalaanki afars kii ijaajat ke bina bhi apni sparton sipaahiyon ko lamaband karte hue, leonidas unamem chune hue teen sau behtareen sainikon ko bahaane se apana angrakshak bataakar; arcadiens ke raste le chalata he
 Upon reaching Thermopylae, they erect a wall of rocks and heave the corpses of the slain Pharisees among them, this action makes the Persian messenger angry
 unheen main se stelios, naam kaa ek sambhraant sparta sainik, un farsiyon ko seemaa se vaapis jane ko kahata he or xerqies ke naam par isi tarah baanh kaat daalane kii sajaa kii chetavanee detaa he
 Meanwhile, Leonidas meets Affialtis, a disfigured Sparta resident whom his parents had escaped to save him from infant killing according to Sparta's law
 efialtis apane pita kii isi mukti ke liye vah leonidas se fouj main behaal hone kii darkhaast karata he, lekin leonidas use chetata he ki vah farsiyon ke liye kabhi bhi bali kaa shikaar ho saktaa he jiske chalate puri sparta fouj ghir sakati he
 Taking pity on him, Leonidas refuses, seeing his physical disability because he cannot lift his shield as high as he needs; For which there should be a necessary possibility in the creation of military armament, Affialtis is very upset to hear this
 jald hi vah jang shuru ho jaati he jab sparton hathiyaar samarpan se inkaar kar dete hai
 He enjoys the advantage of the tight paths of a single entryway, and by his superior fighting skills, the Spartans would also push back a wave of forces from across the Persians at their own pace
 yuddh ke thamane dauraan, xerqies khud leonidas se milakar aatmasamarpan karne ko kahata he, uski mulk ke prati vafadari ko dekh badale main daulat or takat kaa nyauta dene ko maan jaataa he; leonidas yah peshkash thukraata he or usee ke shoorveer samajhane vaale sipaahiyon ko ghatiya darje kaa bataakar xerqies ko banaavati kahkar khilli udaata hai
 In response, Zerkias sends his advance defenders to fight, who become immortal after nightfall
 haalaanki kuchhek spartaon ke maare jane baad bhi, ve bade parakramee se un amar rakshakon haraa daalate he 
 Then on the second day, Zerkias calls for a new military consignment from Asia and other Persian urban countries, including a war elephant to crush all Sparta in one blow, but all methods fail
 is bich, efialtis us khufia raste kaa bhed xerqies ko bataa detaa he is shart par ki use bhi daulat, aisho-aaraam or ek vardi di jaae
 The arcadians soon discover this betrayal of the apialtis, but the Spartans remain there
 leonidas tab jakhmi lekin anicchhuk dilios ko vaapis sparta jane kaa hukum dete he or yahan ghatit har vaakye ko har kisi se, "vijay gaatha" kii tarah waakif karaane kehete hai
 In Sparta, Queen Gorgo urges the Spartan committee to send additional forces to help those 300 soldiers
 lekin bhrasht raajnneetijna theran, jiske mutabik yah samiti uske hi "haq" main bolegi tathaa yahaan tak kii rani sahiba par laanchhan daalata he, ki apni maang manwaane ke liye vah jismani sambandh se bhi gurej nahin karegi
 Seeing Theran being insulted against him in the current assembly, Gorgo loses his temper and fights in fury, with which Zerkias's gold-clad Ashrafis bag, hidden in his cloak, falls
 is beimaani ke khulaase par, sabhi saansadon kii sarvasammati se atirikt balon ko bhejne kii anumati mil jaati he
 On the third day, the Persian army, following Affialtis, besieges the Sparta, passing through his intelligence paths
 xerqies kaa senapati dubaara unase aatmasamarpan karne kii maang karte hai
 Leonidas almost reveals himself to be kneeling, when Stelios leaps onto his back and kills the commander
 kupit xerqies apane sipaahiyon ko hamale ke liye aadesh detaa he
 Leonidas stands up and throws a spear at Zerkys; Even in this slight lapse, a passing spear bites his face, biting his spear, proving that his so-called "king of the gods" is also mortal
 leonidas or uske bache khuche sparton ladaake bhi antim shaks se ladate hai kii aakhir main sabhi tiron kii bhayankar bauchhaar se maare jate hai
 Dilios returns to Sparta, concluding with the lecture at the assembly
 apane raja kii qurbaani se prerit hokar, unani apni 40,000 vishaal balavaan fouj or 10,000 spartao ke saath un farsiyon se aamane-saamne khadi hoti he
 Later, with his last speech commemorating those 300 men, the new captain of the Sparta army, Dilios, descends to Plattea's field to fight the Persians, and the film ends

 The Arya Samaj asks to worship the true God, this God is omnipresent like air and sky, he does not incarnate, he gives fruits to all human beings according to their order, gives birth next, be focused in any solitude at home
 Can
 iske anusaar dainik yajna karnaa har arya kaa karttavya he

 Maharishi Dayanand has given the essence of all this in Satyarth Prakash
 18 ghante samadhi main rahane vaale yogiraj dayanand ne lagbhag aath hajaar kitabon kaa manthan kar adbhut or krantikari satyarth prakaash kii rachana kii
 The best and personal name of God is Om

 Swamiji was the first great man among the religious leaders of modern India who used the word 'swarajya'
 arya samaaj ne hindu dharm main ek nayi chetana kaa aarambh kiya tha
 Arya Samaj was the most powerful movement in the pre-independence era as a renaissance and revival movement of Hindu society
 yah puure pashchim or uttar bharat main sakriy tha tathaa supt hindu jati ko jaagrit karne main sanlagn tha
 Even Arya Samaj preachers were reaching Fiji, Mauritius, Guyana, Trinidad, South Africa with the aim of organizing Hindus
 arya samaajiyon ne sabase bada kaary jati vyavastha ko todane or sabhi hinduon main samanta kaa bhav jaagrit karne kaa kiya
 The way India was made an economic colony of the British government and later a political colony, it was natural for Indians to react sharply against it
 chunki bharat dhire-dhire pashchimi vichaaron kii ore badhane laga tha, atah pratikriya saamaajik kshetra se aana swaabhaavik kaary thi
 This reaction came in the form of social reform movements that arose in the 19th century
 aise hi samaaj sudhaar andolanon main aryasamaj kaa naam aata he
 The Arya Samaj did its work by internal reforms in the society itself, to throw off foreign gambling
 isane aadhunik bharat main prarambh hue purnajagaran ko nai disha di
 At the same time, it inspired Indians to adopt Indianism, to accept ancient culture as fundamental, to end Western influence with the slogan of Pure Indianism i
e
 'return to the Vedas' and unite all Indians
 19veen shatabdi main bharat main samaaj sudhaar ke andolanon main aryasamaj agrani tha
 Aryasamaj took the first step in the salvation of Harijans, he first understood the need for education of girls
 varna vyavastha ko janmagat na maanakar karmgat siddh karne kaa sehara uske sir he | jatibhed bhav or khanpan ke chhotchhaat or chauke-chuulhe kii baadhaon ko mitaane kaa gaurav usee ko praapt he

 Swamiji's scholarly lectures and miraculous personality turned the youth towards Aryasamaj
 anya samakaleen saamaajik dharmik andolanon kii apeksha aryasamaj sahi artha main adhik rashtravaadi tha
 It was a movement with a more aggressive nature against westernization flourishing in India
 arya samaaj ne apni sthapana se hi saamaajik kuritiyon ke viruddh aandolan kaa shankhanaad kiya, jaise- jativaadee jadmulak samaaj ko todna, mahilaon ke liye samaanadhikaar, balvivaah kaa unmoolan, vidhwaa vivaah kaa samarthan, nimna jatiyon ko saamaajik adhikaar praapt hona aadi
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati made the above social renaissance the main foundation behind the establishment of Arya Samaj
 unka vishwaas tha ki naveen prabud bharat main, navjagrit hote samaaj main, naye bharat kaa nirmaan karnaa he to samaaj ko bandhanmukt karnaa pratham kaary hona chahie
 Despite being a Brahmin himself, Swamiji represented the rebellion of the authority of Brahmins and sharply condemned religious superstitions and rituals
 alpakaal main hi ve bharat ke samaaj sudhaar ke kshetra main naveen gyaan-jyoti ke rup main udayiman hue
 In this he found that the Indian youth is insisting on western imitation
 atah unhonen paashchaatya samskruti par shaktishaalee prahaar kiya or bhartiya gaurav ko sadaiv ooncha kiya
 In general, Swamiji criticized regional sects and other religions as well as highlighting the faults operating in Indian society and Hinduism
 purohitwaad par karaara prahaar karte hue swamiji ne mana tha ki swaarthon or agyani purohiton ne puraanon jaise grantho kaa sahaara lekar hindu dharm kaa bhrasht kiya he
 Swami ji was strongly opposed to idolatry, ritualism, mythology, systemicism as a reformer
 iske liye unhone vedon kaa sahaara lekar vibhinn drushtaant kiye
 With this, he made a wonderful attempt to animate the dormant Indian public
 swami ji ne hinduon ko hin, patit or kaayar hone ke bhav se mukt kiya or unamem utkar aatmavishvaas jaagrit kiya
 Consequently, the society could revolt against the mental slavery of the West with strong confidence and determination
 inhi krantikari vichaaron ke kaaran velentine shirol ne swamiji ko 'indian arnest' kaha
 See, Dayanand Anglo Vedic School, Gurukul Kangri University swami dayanand ke mulmantra tha ki janata kaa vikaas or pragati sunishchit karne or unke astitv kii raksha karne kaa sarvottam saadhan shiksha he
 Aryasamaj worked by tying this mantra in a knot
 aryasamaj ne is tathy ko aatmsaat kar liya tha ki shiksha kii jaden rashtriya bhaavana or parampara main gahari jami honi chaiye
 We inherit an ancient and noble tradition
 hamaari shiksha main bhartiya nitishastra or darshan ko sarvopari sthaan praapt hoga

 Swami Dayanand's mother tongue was Gujarati and he had a good knowledge of Sanskrit, but on the advice of Keshav Chandra Sen, he composed Satyarth Prakash in Hindi
 dayanand ne satyarth prakaash jaisaa krantikari granth hindi main rachakar hindi ko ek pratishtha di
 Aryasamaj called Hindi as 'aryabhasha' and said that knowledge of it is necessary for all Aryasamajis
 dayanand ji vedon kaa kii vyakhya sanskrit ke saath-saath hindi main bhi kii
 Swami Shraddhanand also took the loss and published many letters and magazines in Hindi written in Devanagari script whereas his publication was earlier in Urdu
 aryasamaj hindi ke samvardhan ke maidan main agragami bana
 Hindi language was given priority in hundreds of Gurukuls, DAV schools and colleges and for this work new syllabus books were created through Hindi language at places like Gurukul Kangri and Lahore etc
 whose subjects were science, mathematics, sociology, history etc

 aryasamaj dwaara na keval punjab main hindi bhashaa kaa prachaar kiya gaya apitu sudur dakshin bharat main, assam, burma aadi tak hindi ko pahunchaaya gaya
 Efforts were also made by Swami Shraddhanand to use simple Hindi language in place of difficult language in the court
 arya samaaj kii hindi patrakarita ne desh ko rashtriya samskruti, dharmachintan, swadeshi kaa paath padhaayaa
 Through the Aryasamaj, there was an unprecedented growth of literature, both enlightening and romantic
 swami dayanand patrakarita dwaara dharm prachaar vyapak rup se karnaa chaahate the
 He himself could not get out any letter, but encouraged the Arya Samajis to take out magazines and magazines
 arya samaaj kii vibhinn sansthaaon dwaara prasaarit hone vaali patr-patrikaon main ‘pavamaan’, ‘aatm shuddhi path’, ‘vaidic garjana’, ‘arya sankalp’, ‘vaidic ravi’, ‘vishvajyoti’, ‘satyarth saurabh’, ‘dayanand sandesh’, ‘maharishi dayanand smriti prakaash’, ‘tapobhumi’, ‘nutan nishkaam patrika’, ‘arya prerana’, ‘arya sansar’, ‘sudhaarak’, ‘tankaara samachar’, ‘agnidoot’, ‘arya sevak’, ‘bharatoday’, ‘arya musafir’, ‘arya sandesh’, ‘arya maryaada’, ‘arya jagat’, ‘arya mitra’, ‘arya pratinidhi’, ‘arya maartand’, ‘arya jivan’, ‘paropkaaree’, ‘samvarddhini’ aadi masik, pakshik va vaarshik patrikaayen prakashit ho rahi hai jisase hindi patrakarita ko navy alok mil rahaa he
