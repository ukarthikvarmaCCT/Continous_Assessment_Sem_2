 In the role of his poetry collection Parimal published in 1930, he writes - niraala ne 1920 i0 ke aasapaas se lekhan kaary aarambh kiya
 His first composition was a song written on 'janmabhoomi'
 lambey samay tak niraala kii pratham rachana ke rup main prasiddh 'juhi kii kali' sheershak kavita, jiskaa rachanakaal niraala ne swayan 1916 i0 batalaaya tha, vastutah 1921 i0 ke aasapaas likhi gayi thi tathaa 1922 i0 main pehali baar prakashit hui thi
 Apart from poetry, Nirala has written in a tremendous amount in other genres of narrative and prose
 niraala rachanawali naam se 8 khandon main purv prakashit evam aprakashit sampoorn rachanaaon kaa suniyojit prakaashan The greatest feature of Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala' poetry is the skill of illustration
 aantarik bhav ho yaa bahya jagat ke drishy-rup, sangitatmak dhvaniyaan ho yaa rang or gandh, sajiv charitra hon yaa prakritik drishy, sabhi alag-alag laganevaale tattvon ko ghulaa-milakar niraala aisa jeevant chitra upasthit karte hai ki padhane vaala un chitron ke madhyam se hi niraala ke marm tak pahunch saktaa he
 Nirala's paintings not only contain her emotion, but also her thinking
 isliye unki bahut-si kavitaaon main darshanik gaharaai utpann ho jaati he
 Due to this new illustration skill and philosophical depth, often Nirala's poems become somewhat complicated, which the thinkers accuse them of rigor etc
 as they do not understand
 unke kisaan-bodh ne hi unhen chhayavaad kii bhoomi se aage badhkar yatharthwaad kii nai bhoomi nirmit karne kii prerana di
 Seeing special situations, characters and scenes, recognizing their heart and making those specific objects the subject of illustration is a notable feature of Nirala's realism
 niraala par aadhyatmavaad or rahasyavaad jaisi jivan-vimukh pravritiyon kaa bhi asar he
 Due to this effect, they often dream of conquering miracles and ending conflicts
 niraala kii shakti yah he ki ve chamatkaar ke bharose akarmanya nahin baith jate or sangharsh kii vaastavik chunauti se ankhen nahin churaate
 In some cases, mysticism goes against the unique real life experiences
 har ore prakaash failaa he, jivan alokamay mahaasaagar main dub gaya he, ityadi aisi hi baaten hai
 But this mysticism is not permanent in the sense of the infrequent, it proves to be fleeting
 anek baar niraala shabdon, dhvaniyon aadi ko lekar khilwaad karte hai
 It is difficult to call these players art
 lekin saamanyat: ve in khilvaadon ke madhyam se bade chamatkaarpurn kalatmak prayog karte hai
 The specialty of these experiments is that they are helpful in expressing the subject or emotion more effectively
 niraala ke prayogon main ek vishesh prakaar ke saahas or sajagata ke darshan hote hai
 It is this courage and awareness that makes Nirala different and special among poets of his era

 In eye exercises, looking through the eye, using instruments with a stereoscope is used
 gdfdfg The eyes only accept images of light, but real vision is in the brain
 netrarachana main bataaya ja chukaa he ki drushtipatal ke tantrika reshe drushtitantrika banaate hai
 The retina of the two eyes moves backwards and together make an axillary
 yahan drushtipatal se nasardh ke reshe vipareet disha main cross kar jate hai, kintu shankhardh ke reshe usee ore aage badhate hai
 Thus, the left axis starting from the swastika has the fibers of the two sides of the retina and the right of the southeast in the right
 gartika se aanevaale reshon kaa bhi isi prakaar vitaran hota he
 The axillary travels to two sites, to the appendage, where the centers of vision are reflexed, and to the lateral curviline, from which new recesses begin that form axes in the occipital cortex
 ye reshe aantar samput se hokar guzarate hai
 In this way half the vision is obtained from each occipital segment of the brain
 akshipath main ek tihaai reshe gartika ke hote hai, atev mastishk main bhi gartika se praapt samvednaa ko adhik sthaan miltaa he
 How much area you can see without moving your eyes or head can be marked by the perimeter

 At one time large amounts of hydrogen were produced by the action of steam on hot spongy iron
 aaj hydrogen praapt karne kii sabase sasti vidhi 'jal gas' he
 Hydrogen and carbon monoxide are particularly present in water gas
 jal gas ko thandakar drav main parinat karte hai
 The liquid is then distilled by the distillate
 isse carbon monooxide or nitrogen pehle nikal jate hai or hydrogen shesh rah jaataa he
 Electrical decomposition of water can also provide sufficiently pure hydrogen
 ek kilowat ghantase lagbhag 7 ghan foot hydrogen praapt ho saktaa he
 In some electrolytic formulations such as salt-to-fire soda, a large amount of hydrogen is obtained as a by-product
 hydrogen vaayu yaa oxigen main jalataa he
 The heat of burning is high
 jwaala rangahin hoti he
 By burning it produces water and a small amount of hydrogen peroxide
 hydrogen or oxigen ke mishran main aag lagane yaa vidyut sphuling se bade kadaake ke saath visphot hota he or jal kii boonden banati hai
 Hydrogen is a good reducing agent
 lohe ke morchon ko lohe main or taanbe ke oxide ko taanbe main parinat kar detaa he
 This combined with other elements makes the compound
 chlorine ke saath chloride,, nitrogen ke saath ammonia gandhak ke saath hydrogen sulphide, phosphorus ke saath phosphone ye sabhi dwiangi yogic hai
 These are called hydrides or udzaray
 hydrogen ek vicitra gunavala tatv he
 If it is, it behaves like metals with many compounds on non-metal
 iske parmaanu main keval ek proton or ek electron hote hai
 In normal hydrogen, 0
002 percent has a second hydrogen, which is called heavy hydrogen
 yah saamaanya parmaanu hydrogen se duguna baari hota he
 It is called 'deuterium' and its origin is when hydrogen gets more neutrons and such deuterium is called isotopic of hydrogen
 oxigen ke saath milakar yah baari jal banaata he
 Another isotopic form of hydrogen is also formed
 ise tritium kehete hai or iskaa utpatti hota he jab duterium ko ek adhik neutron milte he
 It is three times heavier than normal hydrogen
 hydrogen ke anu ko jab atyadhik ooshmaa main rakhte hai tab ve parmanuviya hydrogen main viyojit ho jate hai
 The lifetime of such hydrogen depends on the pressure and is very short
 aisa parmanviya hydrogenrasayanat: bada sakriy hota he or saamaanya taap par bhi anek tatwon ke saath sanyukt ho yogic banaata he

 hindu dharm ke deepawali, ganesh chaturthi, holi evam navaratri, islam main id ul-fitr evam id-ul-azaha, buddha dharm main buddha jayanti evam ambedkar jayanti, isaai dharm main christmis evam good friday jaise tyonhaar deshbhar main lokapriy hai
 National holidays that are celebrated in all states and union territories
 bharat main teen rashtriya diwas manaaye jate hai
 These are: hinduon dwaara puure varsh main anek tyoharon manaaye jate hai
 Following is the list of popular festivals: andhra pradesh, bihar, kerala, nagaland, sikkim, tamilnadu, maharashtra, karnataka, uttarakhand or uttar pradesh main do din kaa avkashodisha, assam, madhya pradesh, meghalaya, tamilnadu or tripura main teen din kaa avkashpashchim bengal main 6 din kaa avkashodisha main 11wein din bhashni utchhaav In Assam, West Bengal, Karnataka, Odisha, the day is celebrated for five days in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh for 6 days in Maharashtra

 After the independence of India, the United Provinces came to be known as Uttar Pradesh
 26 janvari 1950 ko sanyukt praant ke pradhan govind vallabh pant rajya ke pehle mukhyamantri bane
 President's rule Indian National Congress Samajwadi Party Bahujan Samaj Party Bharatiya Janata Party Janata Dal Janata Party sajiv koshikaon ke dwaara prakaashiya urja ko rasinic urja main parivartit karne kii kriya ko prakaash sanshleshan kehete he
 Photosynthesis is the process in which plants produce carbon dioxide from the air and water from the ground in the presence of sunlight through their green limbs, such as leaves, to produce complex organic foods such as carbohydrates and exclude oxygen gases
 prakaash sanshleshan kii prakriya main surya ke prakaash kii upasthiti main paudhon kii hari pattiyon kii konshikaon ke andar carbon diaksaide or pani ke sanyog se pehle saadhaaran carbohydrate or baad main jatil kabohydrate kaa nirmaan hota he
 In this process, oxygen and energy-rich carbohydrates, etc
) are produced and the oxygen gas comes out
 jal, carbondioxide, surya kaa prakaash tathaa chlorophyl ko prakaash sanshleshan kaa avyav kehete hai
 Out of this, water and carbon dioxide are called raw materials of photosynthesis
 prakaash sanshleshan kii prakriya sabase mahatvapurn jaivaracinic abhikriyaaon main se ek he
 All the living beings of the world directly or indirectly depend on it
 prakaash sanshveshan karne vaale sajivon ko swaposhi kehete hai
 Light does not participate in the reaction here, rather the presence of light is necessary for this reaction
 is rasinic kriya main carbondioxide ke 6 anuon or jal ke 12 anuon ke bich rasinic kriya hoti he jiske falswaroop glucose ke ek anu, jal ke 6 anu tathaa oksijan ke 6 anu utpann hote hai
 In this activity, the main product is glucose, and oxygen and water are released as a substance
 is pratikriya main utpann jal koshika dwaara avashoshit ho jaataa he or punah jaev-rasinic pratikriyaaon main lag jaataa he
 Free oxygen enters the atmosphere
 is mukt oxigen kaa strot jal ke anu he carbondioxide ke anu nahin
 The reaction converts the sun's radiation energy into chemical energy
 jo glucose ke anuon main sanchit ho jaati he
 In photosynthesis, solar energy of about 100 terawatts per year is tied up as chemical energy into food molecules
 is urja kaa pariman puri maanav sabhyataa ke vaarshik urja kharch se bhi 7 guna adhik he
 This energy is stored here as potential energy
 atah prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya ko urja bandhan kii kriya bhi kehete hai
 Thus photosynthetic organisms convert about 10,00,00,00,000 tonnes of carbon into biomass every year
 bahut pracheen kaal se yah gyaat he ki paudhe apana poshan jadon dwaara praapt karte hai
 In 1772, Stephen Helles stated that the leaves of plants take food from the air and light has some important function in this activity
 pristle ne 1772 main pehle bataaya ki is kriya ke dauraan utpann vaayu main mombatti jalaai jaye to yah jalati rahati he
 If a living mouse is placed in the air generated after burning the candle, it dies
 usne 1775 main punah bataaya ki paudhon dwaara din ke samay main nikali gas oxygen hoti he
 After this, the engine house stated in 1779 that green plants consume co2 in sunlight and remove oxygen
 di
 saasuur ne 1804 main bataaya paudhe din or raat shwasan me to oxijan hi lete he par prakaash sanshleshan ke dauran oxijan mukt karte he
 Therefore, oxygen is used throughout the day, but oxygen is made only by photosynthesis with carbon dioxide
 saas ne 1887 main bataaya ki hare paudhon ke co2 grahan karne tathaa o2 nikaalane se paudhon main starch kaa nirmaan hota he
 The process of photosynthesis occurring in green plants is a very important activity for plants and other living beings
 is kriya main paudhe surya ke prakaashiya urja ko rasinic urja main parivartit kar dete hai tathaa CO2 pani jaise saadhaaran padaarthon se jatil carbon yogic carbohydrates ban jate hai
 It is only through these carbohydrates that humans and living beings get food
 is prakaar paudhe prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya dwaara sampoorn praani jagat ke liye bhojan-vyavastha karte hai
 Various crops are grown to obtain carbohydrates, proteins and vitamins etc
 and all these substances are produced by photosynthesis
 rabad, plastic, tel, celulos evam kai aushadhiyaan bhi paudhon main prakaash sanshleshan kriya main utpann hoti he
 Green trees take carbon dioxide in the process of photosynthesis and remove oxygen, thus purifying the atmosphere
 oxigen sabhi jantuon ko saans lene ke liye ati aavashyak he
 This action is also very important for the protection of the environment
 matsay-paalan ke liye bhi prakaash sanshleshan kaa bahut mahatv he
 When the process of photosynthesis slows down, the amount of carbon dioxide in water increases
 iskaa 5 si0si0 pratilitre se adhik hona matsay paalan hetu hanikaarak he
 Photosynthesis is also helpful in making biofuels
 iske dwaara paudhe saura urja dwaara jaev eendhan kaa utpaadan bhi karte hai
 This biofuel produces a variety of energy sources undergoing various processes
 udhaaharan ke liye pashuon ko chaara, jiske badale hamen gobar praapt hota he, krishi avshesh ke dwaara khaanaa pakaana aadi
 Photosynthesis has great importance in animals other than humans
 maanav apni twachaa main prakaash ke dwaara vitamin di kaa sanshleshan karte hai
 Vitamin d is a fat-soluble chemical, ultraviolet rays are used in its synthesis
 kuch samudri ghonghe apane aahaar ke madhyam se shaiwal aadi paudhon ko grahan karte hai tathaa inamen maujuud chloroplast kaa prayog prakaash-sanshleshan ke liye karte hai
 Photosynthesis and respiration are complementary and opposite to each other
 prakaash-sanshleshan main carbondioxide or jal ke bich rasinic kriya ke falswaroop glucose kaa nirmaan hota he tathaa oxigen mukt hoti he
 Oxidation of glucose in respiration, in turn, results in water and carbon dioxide
