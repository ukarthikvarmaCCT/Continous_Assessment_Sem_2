 yah upanishad sanskrit bhashaa main likhit he
 Its creators are believed to be the sages of the Vedic period but mainly Vedavas ji is considered the author of many Upanishads
 upanishdon ke rachanakaal ke sambandh main vidwaanon kaa ek mat nahin he
 Some Upanishads have been considered as part of the original codes of the Vedas
 ye sarvaadhik pracheen hai
 Some Upanishads are considered portions of 'brahman' and 'aranyak' texts
 inkaa rachanakaal samhitaon ke baad kaa he
 There is no definite opinion about the period of the Upanishads, the period of the general Upanishads is believed to have been composed from 3000 BC to 500 BC upanishdon ke kaal-nirnay ke liye nimna mukhya tathyon ko aadhaar mana gaya he— The composition of the various Upanishads has been considered by the following scholars in the following order: grenadian rajtantr, grenada kii sanvaidhanik rajtantr he
 The Grenada monarchy has the distinction of being the unitary sovereign sovereign of all 15 tribes, including Grenada and the United Kingdom
 vartmaan satta-vidyaman shaasha, 6 farvari varsh 1952 se maharani elizabeth dwitiya hai
 Grenada's political system is based on the Westminster system, as in other Commonwealth countries, in which the position of head of state is nominal, and the real administrative powers are vested at the head of state
 grenada saidhantik rup se ek rajtantr he, or or grenada ke shaasha ke padaadhikari iske rashtrapramukh hote hai, haalaanki shaasha kii sari sanvaidhanik shaktiyon kaa abhyaas, unke pratinidhi ke rup main, grenada ke governor-general karte hai
 If the woman is a woman, she is referred to as "queen of Granada", and a male lady is referred to as "king of Granada"
 grenada main rajtantr kii aitihaasik prishthbhumi, british aupniveshikta main he, jab 18veen sadi main britain ne apane samrajya kaa vistaar kiya or vishwa ke vibhinn konon main apane upnivesh sthapit kiya
 Gradually these colonies were given sovereignty over their administration, and by the Statute of Westminster, 1931 all these states were given full equal status within the Commonwealth
 jo purv upnivesh, british shaasha ko aaj bhi apana shaasha maanate he, un deshon ko rashtramandal prajabhumi yaa rashtramandal pradesh kaha jaataa he
 As the prominent parallel heads of many of these nations, the British academies also find themselves with the title of head of the Commonwealth
 haalanki shaasha ko aam taurapar british shaasha ke naam se hi sambodhit kiya jaataa he, parantu saiddhanthik taur par saare rashtron kaa samprabhu par saamaan adhikaar he, tathaa rashtramandal ke tamaam desh ek-dusre se purnatah swatantra or swytt hai
 The group of members closest to the sovereign's family is called
 haalaanki, aisa koi drudh niyam yaa vidhannheen he, jo yah suniyojit karata ho kii kin vyaktiyon ko is vishesh samooh main rakhaa jaae, naahi koi aisa vidhaan he jo rajpariwaar ko vistrut rup se paribhaashit karata ho
 Generally, individuals from the UK to whom His / Her Majesty or His / Her Royal Highness is referred to are generally considered members of the royal family
 rajpariwaar main keval samprabhu ko hi sanvaidhanik kartavya va pad praapt hai
 The sovereign and his immediate family members carry out various official, ceremonial and representational functions of the country
 rashtramandal pradeshon ke bich kaa sambandh is prakaar kaa he kii uttaradhikaar ko anushaasit karne vaale kisi bhi bidhan kaa saare deshon kii ekamat sweekruti aavashyak he
 This obligation was imposed by the Statute of Westminster, 1931
 singhasana par uttaradhikaar, vibhinn aitihaasik sanvidhion dwaara anushaasit he
 Historically, succession has been disciplined by the doctrine of male-dominant consanguineous primacy, in which sons have been given priority over eldest daughters, and eldest offspring of the same sex are given first priority

 At a Commonwealth meeting in 2011, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that all Commonwealth territories had agreed to end the male preference tradition, and also to revoke future rulers from prohibiting Catholics from marrying Catholic individuals
 Everyone's approval was obtained
 parantu kyonki british adhirat carch of england ke pramukh bhi hote hai, atah catholic vyaktiyon ko singhasana uttaradhikrut karne par roak lagane vaale vidhaan ko yathaast rakhaa gaya he
 The bill received royal assent on 23 April 2013, and came into force on March 2015 after the passage of the relevant legislation in all Commonwealth territories
 singhasana kaa koi uttaradhikari, swechha se apana uttaradhikaar tyaag nahin kar saktaa he
 The Government of Grenada does not provide any financial assistance to support the maintenance of sovereign, royalty or royal residences located outside the country

 Therefore, like other Commonwealth subjects, it is a parliamentary monarchy
 sansadeey shaasha hone ke naate, shaasha ke saare sanvaidhanik adhikaar, nishpaksh tathaa gaiyr-rajnatik kaaryon tak simit hai, jo saiddhanthik taur par shaasha ke adhikaar hai, parantu vaastavik rup se inhen keval governor-general dwaara hi upyog kiya jaataa he

 Political economics, giving information about the division of political and economic power in a society, describes how this distribution of power is having an effect on the developmental and other policies
 isi baat ko is tarah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki raajnneetik arthshaastra un buddhisangat faisalon kaa adhyayan karata he jo raajnneetik or aarthik sansthaaon ke sandarbh main liye jate hai
 In this study, macro-effects are considered in the light of rational grounds
 multah utpaadan evam vyapaar, tathaa inkaa vidhi, pratha, sarkaar se sambandh or rashtriya aay evam smapda ke vitaran ke adhyayan ko 'raajnneetik arthshaastra' kaha gaya tha
 Political economics originated from moral philosophy
 attharahavin shatabdi main iskaa vikaas rajya ke arthtantr yaa polity ke adhyayan ke uddeshy se kiya gaya tha, isi liye iskaa naam 'political economi' padaa
 The discipline of economics in the long run from Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations published in the mid-eighteenth century to John Stuart Mill's Principles of Political Economy and Karl Marx's 'capital: a Critique of Political Economy' published in the nineteenth century It was mainly known as 'political economics'
 darasal, samaaj-vaigyanikon kii manyata thi ki raajnneetik kaarak aarthik parinaamon par anivaary hi nahin balki nirnayakari prabhaav daalate hai
 In the twentieth century, the disciplines of political science and economics continued to separate
 nioclasical arthshaastra ke prabhaav main arthshaastra kii paddatiyaan raajnneeti se apekshaakrit swytt ho kar viksit huin or arthshaastriyon kaa jor upabhoktaaon or companiyon ke upar padane vaale sarkari niyantranon or bazaar ke vikaas kii paristhitiyon par hota chalaa gaya
 For the past few decades, once again talks of the nexus of politics and economics have started happening and the discussion of new political economics has started to be heard
 raajnneetik arthshaastra kaa is naye ubhaar main khaas baat yah he ki yah raajnneeti ke aarthik mahatva ko rekhaankit karne ke liye aadhunik arthshaastra kii parishkrut vishleshnatmak paddatiyon kaa istemaal karata he
 According to historians of economic science, the term political economy was first used in 1615 by Moncretin de Vatville
 frans kaa yah vanikwaadi vidwaan chahta tha ki aarthik vigyaan kii paribhaasha ko un simaaon se baahar nikaala jaae jinamein unani chintakon ne use simit kar diya he
 According to the ancient Greeks, the field of economics was limited to household expenses
 monkretin ne is vichaar main rajya kii sanstha ke ird-gird hone vaale chintan yani raajnneeti ko bhi jod diya
 In 1761 Sir James Stuart was the first English economist to refer to the term in the title of his book 'an Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy'
 adam smith kaa vichaar tha ki raajnneetik arthshaastra kaa kaam janata ko jeevanyaapan ke liye paryaapt aamadani uplabdh karaane kii praavdhaan karnaa he or duusari ore sarkaar ke liye itane rajasav kaa intazaam karnaa he jisase saarvajanik uddeshyon kii purti ho sake
 Karl Marx did the work of giving political economics a broader meaning out of the scope of the definition given by Smith
 unke samakaleen je
es
 mil kii dilchaspee poonjeewaad kii aalochana main nahin thi, lekin unhone mulya, vyapaar, dhan, aabaadi, vetan, aarthik pranali or aarthik niti ke sandarbh main raajnneetik arthshaastra kii vyakhya kii
 But Marx assumed from British political economics that economic exchange can be equitable only when the labor-price imposed by both parties is equal
 lekin, jab ek paksh shram kareedne vaala or doosraa shram bechney vaala hota he to shram kareedne vaala hameshaa hi kisi bhi vinimay main bahut zyaada laabh hasil kar letaa he
 On the basis of this benefit, the capital keeps accumulating progressively with him
 is poonji sanchay ke gahan or doorgaami aarthik-saamaajik falitarth hote hai or iske garbh se prabhutv va adhinsthata kii samjik sanrachanaayen janm leti hai
 Indeed, Aristotle had raised the problem of the confusion Marx was suggesting in his Nicomacian Ethics
 arestu ke is vimarsh main aadhunik raajnneetik arthshaastra ke beej nihit the
 Aristotle said that when two people exchange any two things, one of them is better and one is less
 aise main donon main se kisi ek paksh ko duusare ke mukaable adhik laabh hona laazmi he
 His question was how to equalize the benefits of both, as the inequality of benefits could lead to a heterogeneous society
 arestu ke paas is samasya kaa hal nahin tha
 Marx's era was an era of development of nations, so he concluded that capitalism goes on accumulating wealth on a large scale and reached a point and plays a major role in the development of the nation
 lenin ne marks ke isi vichaar kaa vistaar karte hue dikhaaya ki kis tarah upniveshwaad or samrajyavad ke zariye poonjeewaad apana antarrashtriya vistaar karata he
 By taking advantage of the discussions of Marx and Lenin, economists were able to formulate many kinds of radical assumptions
 unhone yojanapurvak raajnneeti or arthshaastra ko aapas main mila diya, poonjeewaad kii prakruti or raajnneetik dalon ke iraadon kii jaanch kii
 In this context, public production, external influences and monopolies were analyzed
 alag-alag sarkaron dwaara sansadhano kaa bantwaaraa karne kii prakriya kii bhi vyakhya kii gayi
 The leftist aspects of political economics played a major role in the formulation of the concept of a philanthropic state
 pachaas ke dashak main richard em
 titumus ne europe kii zamin par lokopkaaree rajya ko teen modelon main baant kar dekha
 He pointed out that anglo-saxon countries adopt politics of public favor only when the market fails
 yah aanshik kism kaa lok upkaar he
 In countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, the politics of public favor is mixed in economics to improve industrial achievements
 scandivenian deshon main sansthagat punarvitaramkaari model kii tarah lok upkaar kii raajnneeti kii jaati he
 Recently, the philanthropic state has also been interpreted as welfare capitalism
 da thri varlds of welfare capitalizam main gosta asping-anderson ne lokopkaaree rajya kii poonjeewaadi jadon ko spasht karte hue dikhaaya he ki ye model udaarataavaadi, anudaarataavaadi or saamaajik-janavaadee kism ke hai
 Neo-classical economics, which took place in the mid-twentieth century, advocated an economic science independent of the influence of politics as opposed to political economics
 is pravriti ke bolbaale ke daur main sambhavtah joseph shumpiter kii rachana capitalizam, soshalzim and democraisi ek aisi kriti thi jisamen antarnihit tha ki arthshaastra kaa adhyayan raajnneeti ke adhyayan se judaa he
 In the light of market failure, political economics has re-asserted its claim over the past few decades
 iskaa ek bada pramaan us samay mila jab disambar, 2007 main nobel puraskaar lete hue teen arthshaastriyon ne alag-alag bhaashan diye
 The three not only underlined the need for integration of political institutions and economic institutions in their own ways, but also said that this integration has generally taken place
 unka kahana tha ki akhirkaar donon hi kism kii sansthaayen apane-apane kism ke tantron kii numaaindgi karti hai, unke bich paraspar nirbharta he or donon hi parinaam hasil karne main anivaary bhoomika nibhaati hai
 Mayerson said that it is necessary to give importance to economics, but it cannot be cut off from politics
 prayek saamaajik sanstha vibhinn tarah ke protsaahanon ko aarthik or raajnneetik pahaluon se mila kar khadi kii jaati he
 a better social institution is one in which this mixture is done wisely
 tabhi vah galat nirnyon or vibhinn baadhaon se paar paane ke liye sakriy or samanvit prayaas kar paati he
 There is no doubt that the separation of economics and political science has contributed to the development of the field of knowledge
 vidwaanon kii kai pidiyon ne ek- duusare se swatantra or swytt adhyayan karke na jane kitne siddhanton or vichaaron kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 In this process, the subject is redefined in new and better analytical perspectives
 lekin, vyaavhaarik drushtikon se yah algaav kabhi vishuddh aarthiki yaa vishuddh raajnneetik- vigyaan ke vikaas kaa rasta nahin khol paaya
 Now the integration of the two is once again being discussed, although scholars of both disciplines are already working in mutual fields
 yahan tak ki navaudarataavaadi nitiyon main bhi yah nirbharta badi he

 is shaasha ko chouhan vansh kaa udit nakshatra kahana atishyokti nahin hoga
 According to Dr
 Harvilas Sharda, Hammir Dev was the first son of Jaitrasinh and had two brothers, whose names were Suratana Dev and Birama Dev
 doctor dasharath sharma ke anusaar hammir dev jaitrasingh kaa teesraa putr tha vahiin gopinath sharma ke anusaar sabhi putron main yogyatam hone ke kaaran jaitrasingh ko hammir dev atyant priy tha

 ye prithviraj chouhaan ke vanshaj the
 His father's name was Jaitrasingh
 ye itihaas main ‘‘hathi hammir ke naam se prasiddh hue hai
 When Hammir became the ruler of Ranthambore in 1339, a new chapter in the history of Ranthambore begins
 hammir dev ranthambhore ke chouhaan vansh kaa sarvaadhik shaktishaalee evam mahatvapurn shaasha the

 They have become famous in history as "hathi Hammir"
 jab hammir visan 1339 main ranthambhore ke shaasha bane tab ranthambhore ke itihaas kaa ek nayaa adhyay prarambh hota he
 Hammir Dev was the most powerful and important ruler of the Chauhan dynasty of Ranthambore
 inhone apane baahubal se vishaal samrajya sthapit kar liya tha
 Jalaluddin Khilji attacked Ranthambore in 1347 AD
 sabase pehle usne chhangarh par akraman kiya
 The Muslim army took control of this fort after strong resistance
 tatpashchaat muslim sena ranthambhore par akraman karne ke liye aage badi
 He attacked to take over the fort, but the Chauhan heroes, led by Hammir Dev, did so much harm to the Sultan, that he was forced to return to Delhi
 chhangarh par bhi chouhanon ne dubaara adhikaar kar liya
 Two years after this attack, the Muslim army invaded Ranthambore again, but they were defeated this time and returned to Delhi
 visan 1353 main sultan jilaluddin khilji kii hatya karke allaudin khilji dilli kaa sultan bana
 He aspired to bring the whole of India under his rule
 hammir ke netritv main ranthambhore ke chouhanon ne apni shakti ko kaaphi sudrudh bana liya or rajasthan ke vistrut bhubhag par apana shashan sthapit kar liya tha
 Alauddin Khilji did not want to see the increasing power of the Chauhans near Delhi, so a struggle was inevitable
 i

 1299 main allaudin kii sena ne gujarat par akraman kiya tha
 They were bringing a lot of loot money from there to Delhi
 maarg main lut ke dhan ke bantwaare ko lekar kuch senanayakon ne vidroh kar diya tathaa ve vidrohi senanayake raav hammirdev kii sharan main ranthambhore chale gaye
 These commanders were Mir Muhammad Shah and Kamru
 sultan allaudin ne in vidrohiyon ko saunp dene kii maang raav hammir se kii, hammir ne uski yah maang thukraa di
 Rao Hammir, following the principles of Kshatriya religion, did not return the soldiers who came to the asylum
 sharan main aae hue kii raksha karnaa apana karttavya samajha
 Alauddin got angry on this and prepared for war on Ranthambore
 allaudin kii sena ne sarvapratham chhangarh par akraman kiya
 He easily got here
 chhangarh par musalamaanon ne adhikaar kar liya he, yah samachar sunakar hammir ne ranthambhore se sena bheji
 The Chauhan army defeated the Muslim soldiers
 muslim sena parajeet hokar bhaag gai, chouhanon ne unka lutaa hua dhan va astr-shastr lut liye
 In 1358 AD, Alauddin Khilji again attacked the Chauhans
 chhangarh main donon senaaon main bhayankar yuddh hua
 In this war, Hammir himself did not go to war
 vir chouhanon ne veertapurvak yuddh kiya lekin vishaal muslim sena ke saamne kab tak tikte
 In the end, the Sultan took control of Chhangarh
 tatpashchaat muslim sena ranthambhore kii taraf badhane lagi
 The Turkish generals sent information to Hamir Dev, to hand us over to our rebels, whom you have given shelter to
 hamaari sena vaapis dilli laut jaaegi
 But Hammir was firm on his word
 usne sharnaagaton ko saunpane athwa apane rajya se nirvasit karne se spasht manaa kar diya
 The Turkish army laid siege to Ranthambore
 turki sena ne nusrat khan or ulug khan ke netritv main ranthambhore par akraman kiya
 Due to the fort being on a very high mountain, it was very difficult for the enemy to reach it
 muslim sena ne gheraa kada karte hue akraman kiya lekin durg rakshak un par pattharon, baanon kii bauchhaar karte, jisase unki sena kaa kaaphi nuksaan hota tha
 This kind of encirclement of the Muslim army continued for many days
 lekin unka ranthambhore par adhikaar nahin ho sakaa
 Alauddin again sent messengers to Rao Hammir to hand over the rebel soldiers, our army would return to Delhi
 hammir hath purvak apane vachan par drudh tha
 For a long time the circle of the Muslim army continued and the Chauhan army kept on fighting
 allaudin ko ranthambheer par adhikaar karnaa mushkil lag rahaa tha
 He resorted to deceit
 hammir ke paas sandhi kaa prastaav bheja jisko paakar hammir ne apane aadmi sultan ke paas bheje
 Among those men, there was a Surjan Kothari and some crying heroes
 allaudin ne unako lobh laalach dekar apni taraf milaane kaa prayaas kiya
 Some of these secretly turned to the Sultan
 durg kaa dheraa bahut dinon se chal rahaa tha, jisase durg main rasad aadi kii kami ho gai
 The fortress now considered the final decisive war
 rajputon ne kesharia vastra dhaaran karke shaakaa kiya
 The Rajput army opened the fort's doors
 bheeshan yuddh karnaa prarambh kiya
 There was a face-to-face battle on both sides
 ek ore sankhya bal main bahut kam rajput the to duusari ore sultan kii kai guna bady sena, jinke paas paryeti yuddhadi saamagree evam rasad thi
 In front of the might of the Rajputs, the Muslim soldiers could not stand, they ran away leaving the flags of the Muslim soldiers, the Rajputs snatched and the Rajput army returned to the fort
 durg par se raniyon ne musalamaanon ke jhando ko durge kii ore aate dekhakar samajha kii rajput haar gaye atah unhone johar kar apane aapako agni ko samarpit kar diya
 On entering the fort, seeing the flames of Jauhar, Hamir realized his mistake
 usne praayshchit karne hetu kile main sthit shiv mandir par apana mastak kaat kar shankar bhagwaan ke shivlinga par chadhaa diya
 When Alauddin came to know about this incident, he returned and captured the fort
 yah pankti hammir mahakavy main hammir dev chouhan ke bare main likhi gai he is pankti kaa taatpary he ki rajasthan ke ranthambhore samrajya kaa maharaja hammir dev chouhan singh ke samaan gujarata tha arthath usne kabhi chhupakar muqabla nahin kiya wo sher kii bhanti raaj karata tha
 The promise of the word means that King Hammir considered it his first duty to fulfill the promise given to him, and in the same way that the fruit of the Kadali grows once in the same way, in the same way, King Hammir was also angry when he got victory over anger
 
 triya arthath aurat ko shaadi ke vakt ek baar hi tel chadhaane kii rasm hoti he usee prakaar hammir bhi kisi kaary ko baar baar dohraane kii bajaae ek hi baar main puraa karnaa mahatv purna samajhataa tha arthath raja hammir dev chouhan kaa hath uski nidarta kaa pratik rahaa he
 He was the only Chauhan ruler who considered independent rule to be his pride and this self-respect of Hammir Dev Chauhan was heartening to Maharana Pratap and Pratap did not accept the Mughal ruler Akbar's lifetime suzerainty
 doctor dasharath ne mana he ki hammir dev chouhan ke pita maharaja jaitrasingh ne hammir kaa rajarohan san 1282 main apane hi jeevankaal main kar diya tha
 According to the Hammir epic, Hammir was not the eldest son, however he sat on the throne on the Vikram Samvat 1339 in Magh month on Sunday
 vahiin prabandhkosh ke anusaar hammir dev chouhan kaa rajarohan vikram sanwat 1343 ke kareeb bataaya gaya he
 The creation of both the Hammir epic and Prabandhak epics were contemporaries of Hammir Dev, Dasharatha Sharma accepted the coronation of Hammir Dev between 1339 and 1343 and his father Jaitrasinh handled Hammir Dev as a vast empire of the Ranthambore empire
 But Hammir Dev Chauhan's ambitious ruler was not satisfied with this empire
 bharatvarsh ke aitihaasik shaskaon main hammir dev chouhan ko hathiraja hathpati ranpati evam ranpradesh kaa chouhan naam se pahchaan banaai
 The name of the beloved horse of Maharaja Hammir Dev Chauhan was Badal, the name of the queen of Hammir Dev Chauhan was Rangadevi and the name of her daughter was Padmala, which was very dear to Hammir Dev

 In this Prabandhakavya, the character of Hammir Dev, the famous ruler of Ranthambore, is described on the Chappay system of the Veeragatha period
 is main bataaya gaya he ki hammir dev chouhan ne sharnaagat kii raksha ke liye apana sabakuch nyochhavar kar diya
 King Hammir defeated the Delhi ruler Jalaluddin Khilji several times and shattered the teeth of a ruler like Alauddin Khilji
 hammir rasau hammir kii virgthaon ke saath ojasvi bhashaa main bahut acha mahakavy he
 This epic tells that Muhammad Shah was very much in love with the Begum of Alauddin Khilji, the ruler of Mongol Delhi and robbed him of his wealth and fled from there, which Alauddin Khilji wanted to capture

 In Samvat 1902, Chandrashekhar Vajpayee wrote Hammir Hatha Granth

 According to Hammir Rasou, the Ranthambore Empire extended Hammir Dev from Ujjain to Mathura and from Malwa to Arbudachal
 hammir rasau se gyaat hota he ki hammir dev ujjain ko jitkar mahakaleshwar jyotirling main shiv kii puja kii thi evam ajmer ko jitkar pushkar main shahi snaan kiya tha
 Some verses of Hammir Rasou are intended: - kab hath kare alaudi, rantabhanvar garh aahi
 Kabhai Sekh Sarnai is staying, Bahimah Mahim Sahi
 
 Let me think in your mind, the title is not fermented

 In Hammir Hatha Chandrashekhar has shown the reality by following the best system, the poet has put a good effect on this allegiance of being loyal to Hammirsharanatharanagata

 According to Dashrath Sharma, Hammir Chauhan defeated King Jayasimha of Mandalgarh Udaipur and kept him captive in Ranthambore, after that Hammir Dev left him on the point that he would continue to give the Ranthambore empire forever and in the interest of every possible Ranthambore empire
 Will work hammir dev ne vartmaan mount abu ke raja pratapsingh ko parrast karne ke baad maar diya tha

 Analyzing imperialism in his book "imperialism", he said that this is the last and the last floor of the development of capitalism
 usne un paristhitiyon par bhi prakaash daalaa jo samrajyavad ke vinaash ke anivaary bana detii hai
 He made it clear that in the era of imperialism, the speed of economic and political development of capitalism is not same in all countries

 The workers and peasants got rid of the capitalists and the landlords and full equality was established among the inhabitants of the entire country
 navasthapit soviet prajatantr kii raksha ke liye laal sena kaa nirmaan kiya gaya
 Lenin now took up the task of building this first state of the world of workers and peasants
 usne "di emidiat tasks of di soviet government" tathaa "di prole terrian rivaalution and di reniged kautski" naamak pustaken likhin 
 Lenin stated that the dictatorship of the workers is indeed true democracy for the majority of the people
 uskaa mukhya kaam dabaav yaa jor jabardastee nahin varan sanghatnatmak tathaa shikshan sambandhi kaary he
 In 1928-20, three years of military interventions and housewarming of foreign countries, Lenin led the Soviet public to a firm fight against foreign invaders and counter-revolutionaries
 is vyapak ashaanti or grihayuddh ke samay bhi lenin ne yuddh kaal se hui desh kii barbaadi ko dur kar sthiti sudhaarney, vidyutikaran kaa vikaas karne, parivahan ke sadhano ke vistaar or choti choti joton ko milakar sahyog samitiyon ke aadhaar par bade farm sthapit karne kii yojanaayen aarambh kar deen
 He emphasized on reducing the size of government machinery, improving it and reducing expenditure
 usne shikshit or manishi varg se kisaanon, mazdooron ke saath sahyog karte hue nae samaaj ke nirmaankarya main sakriy bhaag lene kaa aagrah liya
 As far as the foreign policy of the Soviet regime is concerned, Lenin unceremoniously tried to maintain peace
 usne kaha ki "hamaari samast niti or prachaar kaa lakshya yah hona chahie ki chaahe kuch bhi ho jaae, hamaare deshavaasiyon ko yuddh kii aag main na jhonka jaae
 We should move towards ending the fight
 " usne samyawad ke shatruon se desh kaa bachaav karne ke liye pratiraksha vyavastha ko sudrudh banane par bal diya or soviet nagarikon se aagrah kiya ki ve "vaastavik" loktantr tathaa samaajwaad ke sthapanarth vishwa ke anya sabhi deshon main rahanevaale shramikon ke saath antarrashtriya bandhutav kii bhaavana badhaane kii ore adhik dhyaan den

 unke shav ko ambam kiya gaya or wo aaj bhi moscow ke red skhware main rakhaa he
 After the death of Lenin, who was counted among the most important and influential figures of the 20th century, his personality had a profound impact on a large section
 saal 1991 main soviet sangh ke bikharane tak unka khaasaa asar jari rahaa
 marxvad-leninavaad ke saath unki vaicharik ahmiyat kaafii rahi or antarrashtriya communist movement main unka khaas sthaan rahaa
 However, he is also considered to be a much controversial and discriminatory leader
 Lenin considers his supporters a champion of socialism and the working class, while critics remember him as the leader of a dictatorial power responsible for political atrocities and mass killings
 leninavaad Lenin's idea was not to enter politics, but he gave birth to Marxist theory, Lenin has been rejected by many countries of the world today, because Lenin's violent theory promotes violence in the world
 lenin ko unke janm rashrt rus ne naakaara he 
 Even today, North Korea is the biggest example of Lenin's violent attitude in many countries
 lenin ko samyavaadee mana jaataa he lekin asal main wo ek hinsak tantra chaahate the
 Many people may agree with Lenin's views
 lekin ab unke hinsak vichaaron se bahut se log asahmat he
 It can be seen in this way that the image of Lenin is being removed from different countries
 rus bhi unako apana prerak nahi maanata he
 a nationalist ideology is required for a nation
 lekin lenin ne yuddh ke samay rasiyaa ke logon se rasiyaa ke viruddh shaastra uthaane kii apil kii jo kisi bhi raashtra ke liye ghotak he 
 Therefore, it would be appropriate to view Lenin as the father of a violent terrorism, not nationalist
 haa ye satya he kii lenin kaa raajnneeti par prabhaav rahaa, lekin usase bada satya ye he kii lenin kii hinsak vichaardhaara ko aaj samaapt kiya ja rahaa he, or raashtra ke uchit shanti or ahimsa kii rashtravaadi vichaardhaara ko apanaaya ja rahaa he
 Which is the best work for any nation

 hindi main naatakon kaa prarambh bharatendu harishchandra se mana jaataa he
 Bharatendu and his contemporary playwrights of that period composed plays for the development of public consciousness, so social problems of that time had a good opportunity to be expressed in plays
 jaisaaki kaha ja chukaa he, hindi main avyavsaayik saahitiyik rangamanch ke nirmaan kaa shriganesh aagaahasan ‘amaanat’ lakhanvi ke ‘inder sabha’ naamak geeti-roopak se mana ja saktaa he
 But the truth is that Inder Sabha was not really a theatrical work
 isamen shaamiyane ke neeche khulaa stage rahata tha
 The audience used to sit like a gimmick on three sides, on one side the seat of King Inder was put on the seat, along with chairs for the fairies
 sazindon ke peeche ek laal rang kaa pardaa lataka diya jaataa tha
 Characters were entered from behind it
 raja inder, pariyaan aadi paatr ek baar aakar vahiin upasthit rahete the
 They did not go back by speaking their dialogues
 us samay natyarangan itnaa lokapriy hua ki amaanat kii ‘inder sabha’ ke anukaran par kai sabhaayen rachi gai, jaise ‘madarilal kii inder sabha’, ‘daryai inder sabha’, ‘hawaii inder sabha’ aadi
 Parsi drama circles also adopted these synagogues and Majlisperistan
 ye rachanaayen naatak nahin thi or na hi inase hindi kaa rangamanch nirmit hua
 That is why Bharatendu Harishchandra used to call them 'natakabhas'
 unhone inaki parody ke rup main ‘bandar sabha’ likhi thi
 Thus, commercial and non-commercial literary efforts of Hindi theater and theatrical work took place before Bharatendu but the real and permanent theater of Hindi could not be built and developed
 san 1850 i
 se san 1868 i
 tak hindi rangamanch kaa udai or prachaar-prasar to hua par uskaa suruchipurna vikaas or sthaayee nirmaan nahin ho sakaa tha
 Apart from Parsi drama circles, some other small commercial circles were formed at different places but there was also a lack of literary interest in them
 vyavsaayik mandaliyon ke praytn main hindi rangamanch kii jo ruparekha bani thi, prachaar or prasar kaa jo kaam hua tha tathaa inke kaaran jo kuch achche naatakkaar hindi ko mili the-us avasar or paristhiti kaa laabh nahin uthaaya ja sakaa tha
 The writing of Bharatendu's play begins with a translation of Bangla's Vidyasundara play
 yadhyapi naatak unke pehle bhi likhe jate rahe kintu niyamit rup se khadiboli main anek naatak likhakar bharatendu ne hi hindi naatak kii neenv ko sudrudh banaaya
 Among the earlier playwrights of Bharatendu, many scholars consider the play 'anand Raghunandan' written in the Brijbhasha of Rewa Naresh Vishwanath Singh and 'nahusha' of Gopalachandra as the first drama in Hindi
 yahan yah jaananaa rochak ho saktaa he ki gopalchandra, bharatendu harishchandra ke pita the
 1868 AD has a great importance in terms of the tradition of Hindi literary theater and theatrical creation
 bharatendu ke naatak-lekhan or manchikaran kaa shriganesh isi varsh hua
 Prior to this, neither a real drama with entry-movement of characters, scene-planning etc
 was composed in Hindi
 bharatendu ke pita gopalchandar chit ‘nahush’ tathaa maharaj vishwanathasingh rachit ‘anandarghunandan’ bhi purna naatak nahin the, na pardon or drishyon aadi kii yojana vaala viksit rangamanch hi nirmit hua tha; natyarangan ke adhiktar prayaas bhi abhi tak mumbai aadi ahindi bhashi kshetron main hi hue the or bhashaa kaa swaroop bhi hindi-urdu kaa mishrit khichdi rup hi tha
 On April 3, 1868, the play 'janaki Mangal', composed by Pt
 Sheetlaprasad Tripathi, was held at the Banaras Theater
 kehete hai ki jis ladke ko lakshmana kaa abhinay part karnaa tha vah achaanak us din biimaar pad gaya
 The problem of Laxman's acting was present and if the youth did not manage the situation on that day, then the drama would have to be postponed
 bharatendu ne ek-dedh ghante main hi na keval lakshmana kii apni bhoomika yaad kar lee apitu puure ‘janaki mangal’ naatak ko hi mastishk main jamaa liya
 Bharatendu did not care for his aristocracy
 un dinon ucch kul ke log abhinay karnaa apni pratishtha ke anukool nahin samajhate the
 Thus, with this play, Bharatendu started taking active part in theater
 isi samay-unhone natya-srijan bhi armbh kiya
 From 1868 AD to 1885 AD, Bhartendu created many plays in the remaining 17 years from his dream and very busy life, acted in many plays himself, built many theater and tried to establish Hindi theater
 yahi nahin, bharatendu ke anek lekhakon or rangakarmiyon ko natya-srijan or abhinay ke liye prerit kiya
 With the industriality and inspiration of Bharatendu, an unofficial literary theater of Hindi was established in many places like Kashi, Prayag, Kanpur etc
 bharatendu ke hi jivan kaal main ye kuch rang-sansthaayen sthapit ho chuki thim : Apart from these, a strong tradition of Hindi theater and theatrical production was built in many places of Uttar Pradesh, Ballia, Dumraon, Lucknow etc
 bharatendu or unke sahyogi lekhakon ne natya-srijan kii prerana kahan-kahan se praapt kii, yah prashn paryaapt mahatva kaa he
 The importance of this question increases even more from this point of view, when we see that the Natya-composition in Hindi was started by Bharatendu's innovative talent
 yadhyapi bharatendu se purv natya-style main kuch srijan-prayaas hue the, par naatak ke vaastavik rup kaa udbhav sarvapratham bharatendu kii hi lekhini se hua
 Astu, when there was a lack of this literary genre in Hindi, where did Bharatendu take the inspiration of theatrical creation? saahitiyik prerana kii khoj kii jaay to kaha ja saktaa he ki bharatendu ne sanskrit tathaa praakrit kii purvavarti bhartiya natya-parampara or banglaa kii samasamyik natyadhara ke saath angreji prabhaav-dhara se prerana lee
 Although we had a rich Natya-tradition of the earlier Sanskrit dramatists like Bhasa, Kalidas, Bhavabhuti, Shudraka etc
, it is a matter of regret that Bhartendu Babu kept that rich Sanskrit drama-tradition in front of him
 praakrit-apbhransh kaal main arthath isa kii 9veen-10 veen shatabdi ke baad sanskrit naatak hrasonmukh ho gaya tha
 In Prakrit and Apabhramsa also, the Natya-creation did not excel like the previous sanskrit-natya literature
 at: bharatendu ke saamne sanskrit-praakrit kii yah purvavarti hraasgami parampara rahi
 Only the compositions of 'anargaraghava', 'balramayan', 'prasannaraghava', respectively of Murari, Rajashekhar, Jayadeva etc
 of Sanskrit became the ideal of Bharatendu and his associate writers
 inamen na kathy- yaa vishay-vastu kaa vah gammbhiry tha, jo kalidas aadi kii amar kritiyon main tha, na un jaisi style-shilp kii shreshthata thi
 This is the reason why the pre-bhartendu Hindi drama was utterly soulless and though Bhartendu tried to innovate and a bit of impetus by giving a glimpse of the topical, social and cultural life in it, in spite of his efforts, the Bhartendu Hindi drama has both vision and craft
 From the time he was lying in infancy, he did not get the special climax
 is prakaar bharatendu harishchandr ke satyaprayatnon se hindi ke saahitiyik rangakarm or natya-lekhan kii drudh parampara chali
 But after the death of Bharatendu in 1885 AD, that enthusiasm became somewhat slow
 19 veen shatee ke antim dashak main phir kuch chhutput prayaas hue
 Many drama circles were established, such as 'sriramalila Natak Mandali' and 'hindi Natya Samiti' of Prayag, 'sri Bharatendu Natak Mandali' and 'kashi Nagari Natak Mandali' set up in Kashi by Bharatenduji's nephews - Srikrishna Chandra and Shri Brajchandra
 ’ in naatak mandaliyon ke praytn se us samay ‘maharana pratap’, ‘satya harishchandr’, ‘mahabharat’, ‘subhadraharan’, ‘bhishmapitamah’, ‘bilva mangal’, ‘sansar swapn’, ‘kaliyug’ aadi anek naatakon kaa abhinay hua
 But even these efforts could not go on for many days
 dhanabhav tathaa sarkari or gaiyr-sarkari protsaahan ke abhaav main saahitiyik rangamanch kii sthapana ke praytn kaalaantar main sab so gaye
 Under these small efforts, the then literary plays were acted and some good theater-oriented literary plays were composed in Hindi
 parsi naatak companiyon ke dushprabhav kaa to yah prayaas acha jawaab tha, kintu yah prayaas tha bahut hi swalp
 Secondly, Hindi theater did not develop much from this literary movement, because this theater was not different from and developed from Parsi theater - the same scheme of curtains, the same arrangement of visuals and music etc

 vaigyanik sadhano se sampann ghoomane vaale rangamanch kaa vikaas 19 veen shatee main nahin ho sakaa tha
 Efforts to set up soundtrack etc
 also could not give any significant sum towards the development of Hindi theater
 haan, inkaa yahi laabh hua kii parsi naatak companiyon ke bhrasht prachaar ko kuch dhakka laga tathaa kuch rangamanchi hindi naatak prakaash main aae
 The advent of cinema in the third decade of the 20th century brought an end to Parsi theater
 par avyavsaayik rangamanch idhar-udhar nae roopon main jivit rahaa
 Now Hindi theater is only in schools and colleges
 yah rangamanch bade naatakon kii apeksha ekankiyon ko adhik apanaakar chalaa
 There are two main reasons for this - one is that the audience of today wants to fulfill their entertainment in the shortest time, second, for the organizers, the performance of big drama also creates a lot of difficulty here, there the performance of Ekanki is simple - Theater , Scenes and legislation are simple in unity, characters are also very less
 at: sabhi shikshalayon, saanskrithik aayojanon aadi main aajkal ekankiyon kaa hi pradarshan hota he
 Dr
 Ram Kumar Verma, Upendranath Ashk, Seth Govind Das, Jagadishchandra Mathur, etc
 Many of our playwrights have composed beautiful acting-useful Ekanki plays and long plays
 prasad ji ne ucchkoti ke saahitiyik naatak rach kar hindi naatak sahitya ko samrudh kiya tha, par anek naatak rangamanch par kuch kathinaayee utpann karte the
 Nevertheless, with some cropping, almost all the plays of Prasad ji were acted on the non-commercial theater of Hindi
 george barnard shaw, ibson aadi paashchaatya naatakakaron ke prabhaav se uparyukt prasadottar aadhunik naatakakaron ne kuch bahut sundar rangamanchi naatakon kii sristi kii
 Many full plays of these playwrights were also screened from theaters
 swatantraaa ke paashchaat hindi rangamanch ke sthaayee nirmaan kii disha main anek sarkari-gaiyr-sarkari praytn hue hai
 Many non-governmental organizations have also received financial support from the government for the establishment of the theater
 purushon ke saath ab striyaan bhi abhinay main bhaag lene lagi hai
 Some good plays in schools and colleges are now performing well
 anek saamaajik-saanskrithik sansthaaon se sambhddha kuch achche sthaayee rangamanch bane hai, jaise theatre centre ke tattwavdhan main dilli, bombai, kalakatta, elahabaad, hyderabad, bangalore, shantiniketan aadi sthanon par sthaayee rangamanch sthapit hai
 The central government is also paying adequate attention to this
 par in sarvabhashayi rangamanchon par hindi bhikhaarini-si hi prathit hoti he
 The Central Government has established the Sangeet Natak Akademi, in which good playwrights and actors are encouraged
 vyavsaayik rangamanch ke nirmaan ke bhi pichley dinon kuch praytn hue hai
 Famous artist Late Prithviraj Kapoor founded Prithvi Theater a few years back
 unhone kai naatak prastut kiye hai, jaise ‘diwaar’, ‘gaddaar’, ‘pathan’, ‘kalakaar’, ‘aahuti’ aadi
 Even after taking a loss of money, this company did a good job enthusiastically
 par itane prayaas par bhi bombai, dilli yaa kisi jagah hindi kaa sthaayee vyavsaayik rangamanch nahin ban sakaa he

 i have benefited from them
 yadi mainen tumhen kisi prakaar se labhanvit kiya ho to tum bhi ise jari rakho
 The devotees again wrote to Swamiji that the word "chinmaya" signifies God, so we started "chinmaya Mission" with the same name
 chinmay mishan kaa mukhya uddeshy yahi he ki sansar ke kisi kshetra ke vyakti ko veydant gyaan pradaan kar use atmonnati karte hue sukh samrudi praapt karne main or samaaj kaa upyogi ang banane main sahaayta karen

 kisi kaary, samjhaute yaa sanvida kii vaidhata kaa arth he ki vah vidhi ke sangat he
 According to the validity method, validity is a relation that involves validity
 purush or santan kaa sambandh, pita tathaa putr yaa putree ke rup main uskaa sambandh, purush or stri ke sambandh par aadhaarit he jinase us santan kii utpatti hoti he
 In all civilized practices, marriage, whatever its form, is an authentic system and has moral and legal approval
 vivaah ke purv kii santanotpatti anumodith nahin hoti or santan ke liye uttaradhikaar se vanchit karanevaali tathaa mata ke liye ninda kii vastu maani jaati he
 Similarly, the children of widows, except posthumous children, are viewed with hatred by the society
 jahaan pati jivit he lekin yadi santan kii utpatti uski mata tathaa duusare purush se anuchit sambandh se hoti he, to vah varnsankar yaa jaraj samajhi jaati he
 Only those offspring, which arise from a legitimate marital relationship, have a legal status and are considered legitimate
 angl vidhi ke antargat, jo bharatvarsh main sweekrut tathaa apanaai gai hai, santan kii vaidhata kaa sarvamaanya pramaan tabhi he jab uski utpatti uski mata tathaa purush ke vaid vivaah se hui jo yaa vivaah ke viched ke uparaant do sau assi din ke bheetar apni mata tathaa pita se uski utpatti hui ho jab tak yah na pramanit ho jaae ki ubhay paksh ke bich uske utpattikaal main kabhi sampark na hua ho
 In order to avoid the practical difficulty of proving validity in each suit, the law provided a simple way to conclude that until proof to the contrary is given, all children born during the time of marriage will be considered valid
 yadi yah siddhaat pratipaadit na hota to samaaj ke liye apane sidhe sade logon kii paitruk utpatti ke sambandh main khoj been karte rahane kii vyarth kii jhanjhat main phase rahane kii sambhaavna thi
 No support of illegality can be accepted except that the husband did not cooperate with the wife
 sahyog kaa abhipraay, vyapak rup se, sambhog ke arth se he
 Thus, no husband can be deprived of his paternal responsibility by not calling himself father or father
 vidhi isamen itani kathor he ki vaivahik kaal main utpann santan ke pitrutv kaa bhaar use vahan karnaa padegaa, bhale hi stri vastav main vishwasghaat kii aparaadhini ho
 Where husband and wife have sexual intercourse, the offspring resulting from it are undisputedly valid
 is vishay main hindu vidhi angl vidhi kaa anusaran karti he
 But the validity under Muslim law is determined in different ways
 islam vidhi yah vyavastha detii he ki vivaah kaal ke chah maah ke bheetar utpann santan avaidh he jabatak ki pita use apni santan na sweekaar kare yaa chah maah ke uparaant utpann santan vaid he basharte ki pita us asweekaar na kare yaa vivahaviched ke uparaant das chandra maason ke bheetar utpann santan sunni vidhi ke antargat vaid he or shiya vidhi ke antargat do chandra varshon ke bheetar tathaa shafi or maaliki vidhi ke antargat chaar varsh ke bheetar tathaa shafi or maaliki vidhi ke antargat chaar varsh ke bheetar kii santan vaid he
 Two reasons are given for the expansion and variation of this subject and duration
 ek to yah ki praarambhik islaami vidhivettaon ko garbhadhaaran yaa garbhadan ke kaal kii apurna jaankaree thi tathaa doosraa tha stri or usase utpann santan kii ayogyata evam pratishtha ke bachaav ke liye maanviya bhaawanaaon kaa aagrah
 Muslim law, where the request
 musalmaan vidhi, jahaan jaankaree na ho yaa sandigdhta vartmaan ho, vahaan pitrutv ke adhikaar ko sweekaar karti he
 The illegitimate son of a Hindu is entitled to subsistence but does not own any part of the property in succession, but if the mother is non-living then her children will also be deprived of the expenses
 avaidh putree apane pita kii sampatti paane kii adhikarini nahin he, yadhyapi vah apni mata kii sampatti kii uttaradhikarini he
 Under the Muslim law, it is arranged in the Sunni system that the illegitimate child is the heir to his father's property
 musalmaan vidhi ke antargat sunni paddati main vah vyavastha he ki avaidh santan apane pita kii sampatti kii uttaradhikarini nahin ho sakati lekin putr yaa putree mata kii uttaradhikarini nahin ho sakati lekin putr yaa putree mata kii uttaradhikarini ho sakati he
 But the Shia method calls the illegitimate child an outsider and does not allow the father or mother to inherit property from anyone
 sabhi paddatiyon main vaid santan apane pita kii sampatti kii uttaradhikarini he or saath hi uske rin ke liye bhi uttaradaayi he
 After the death of the parent, the immediate heir takes possession of the property in his hands and takes it as a trust until the property received by the obituary is paid
 vaiyaktik vidhiyon kaa dhyaan na rakhte hue bharat main bhartiya dand samhita magistrate ko adhikaar detii he ki vah kisi vyakti ko apni santanon ko jitna uchit samajhe utana masik nirvahvyay dene kii ajna de, chaahe ve vaid hon yaa avaidh
 The intent of the method is to prevent children from earning a livelihood through an undesirable route, where the father is indifferent to protection or refuses to pay for maintenance
 yadi koi vyakti aadesh hone par us aadesh kii purti bina paryaapt kaaran ke nahin karata he, to magistrate prayek aise aadesh ke ulanghan ke liye warrant jari kar saktaa he or use kaid kaa dand bhi de saktaa he jo ek maas se adhik kaa na hoga yaa nirvahvyay kii adaayagi yadi isse pehle ho jaae to adaayagi hone tak kaa dand de saktaa he

 Hindi has two genders: feminine and masculine
 sanskrit main teen hote hai: streeling, pulling or napunsakaling
 There are four genders in Burushaski from which the form of nouns is changed: ling ke aadhaar par sangyaaon ko bahuvachan banane ke liye unke ant main alag-alag pratyay jode jate hai: for example: sanskrit kii tarah burushaski main bhi sangyaaon main kaarak rup dekhe ja sakate hai: In Burushaski, body parts and related people cannot be addressed without telling their relationship with their speakers

 When due to proper work, that physical fiber tension becomes relaxed enough, then the basic instinct and the inspiration arising from it are also relaxed

 Sometimes we are caught between plagues on both sides; On one side there is a well, then on the other side there is a ditch

 Often, the duality of inspirations is often of these three types

 isi prakaar prayek sanshayatmak paraspar virdohi ichchhaaon kii samasya main ham ek ko maanakar duusari ko chhod dete hai
 But in the pursuit of valid euphemism, even the most desirous of times take the opportunity and raise their head, increase their remorse and succeed in defeating the intellect of a person in a particular state and even mislead him
 paristhiti ke saath samaayojan to vyakti kii sahaj prakruti he
 He has to react with a favorable and sometimes unfavorable attitude

 But there can also be a difference between immediate and long-term outlook
 yunaan ke prasiddh darshanik sucraat ko vishpan kaa mrityudand bhi ek aisi saamaajik abhiyojan kii ghatana thi, jisapar vartmaan kaal main ubhay paksh se vadavivaad hota he
 From a psychological point of view, the law, rule or action of prosecution is simple
 paristhiti ke mohak tathaa bhayanak anshon ke anumaan se manushya adhik sukhprapti ke nimitt kaary karata he
 But he either becomes indifferent to the continual conflict of the adverse component of the situation, or changes his evaluation and considers it indirectly beneficial
 jab ek gramin yuvak sena main bharti hota he, to use sara din chust varadi vaa baari boot aadi pahanakar rahanaa praaia: khalataa he
 But in a few days, he makes a habit of tolerating envy from him by calling that disguise a sign of military dignity and seeing the feeling of self-respect in him
 is abhiyojan prakriya se manushya dukhaansh ke prati udasin hota he or samay bitne se vah us anivaary du:kha ko bhul bhi jaataa he, yaa use hi sukhad samajhane lagata he
 It is also the rule of the fleshly fibers that they get tired of working continuously

 Eating too many sweets can make the experience of sweetness fade and fade
 dhoop jalaane par uski gandh to kuch samay tak ham anubhav karte hai kintu thodi der main vah sugandh praaia: lupt ho jaati he
 This condition is a sad part of the situation through daily struggle
 kah sakate hai ki is chetanalop dwaara ham shokmukt hokar samaaj ke saath samyojit hote hai
 But these vanishing motives remain secretly in an unknown psyche state and, after getting a fair chance, try to be favored by the pseudo-known mind
