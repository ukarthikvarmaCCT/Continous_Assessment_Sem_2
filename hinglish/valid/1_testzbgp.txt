 Pampé and the Roman government had very few experienced soldiers in Italy, so they vacated Rome and Caesar took possession of the capital without opposition

 The method of suicide is any such method by which one or more people will kill their life on purpose
 aatmahatya ke tareekon ko jivan lila samaapt karne kii do vidhiyon ke anusaar vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he: shaareerik yaa rasinic
 shaareerik vidhi main is krity ko saamanytah shwasan pranali yaa kendriya tantrika tantra ko bebas karke anjaam diya jaataa he, jisamen aam taur par ek yaa adhik mukhya ghatakon ko nasht karnaa shaamil hota he
 The chemical method focuses on inhibiting biologically important processes such as cellular respiration or diffusion capacity
 aatmahatya ke rasinic tareeke is krity ke adrishy sakshya dete hai jabaki shaareerik tareeke pratyaksh sakshya uplabdh karaate hai
 Suicide by bleeding reduces the blood volume and pressure in the body to dangerous levels by shedding too much blood
 aam taur par dhamniyon ko nuksaan pahunchaakar aisa kiya jaataa he
 Carotid, radial, ulnar, or femoral arteries may be targeted for this
 maut sidhe taur par sharir kii raktaalpata ke kaaran yaa hypovolemia ke madhyam se ho sakati he, jisamen parisancharan tantra main rakt kii maatra bahut hi kam ho jane ke parinaam swarup sharir nishpraan ho jaataa he
 Wrist bites are usually due to intentional self-harm rather than attempting suicide

 nirantar khun bahane ke saath hriday atalata kii sambhaavna paidaa ho jaati he kyonki ant main sharir rakt kii kshatipurti karne main asamarth ho jaataa he
 If the bleeding is allowed to continue, it will result in severe hypovolemia, after which the heart vessels will stop functioning, the heart rate will stop and death
 aatmahatya ke asafal prayaas ke maamle main vyakti kii bahari flexr mansapeshiyon ke tendon yaa haath kii mansapeshiyon ko niyantrit karne vaali ulnaar or median tantrikaon main nuksaan kaa anubhav ho saktaa he; in donon ke hi parinaam swaroop peedit vyakti kii samvednaa or / athwa chalane-phirane par niyantran kii kshamta asthaayee yaa sthaayee rup se kam ho sakati he or / athwa sharir main tej dard yaa autonomik dard bhi utpann ho saktaa he
 As in the case of a Class IV bleeding, it is necessary to aggressively regain consciousness to prevent the patient's death; Standard emergency bleeding control measures are necessary for pre-hospital treatment
 dhamni se rakt srav kii pahchaan rakt kii layaaddh dhar se hoti he jiskaa rang chamkila laal hota he
 On the other hand, bleeding from the extremities produces a continuous stream of dark red blood
 dhamni se hone vaale rakt srav ko rokna kahin adhik kathin hota he or isse aam taur par jivan ko adhik khatra rahata he
 Furthermore, bleeding can be controlled by indirect arterial pressure - for example, pressure on the brachial artery can prevent hand bleeding; However, pressure points should be used with caution as insufficient blood flow can cause serious damage to the arms

 doobana aatmahatya ke sabase kam aam tareekon main se ek he, inaki sankhya sanyukt rajya america main aatmahatya ke report kiye gaye sabhi maamalon main 2% se bhi kam hoti he
 Suicide through suffocation is to inhibit your ability to breathe or to restrict oxygen intake while breathing, which causes asphyxia and eventually exits breathing
 is tareeke main ek agsit bag shaamil hota he yaa ek band sthaan main oxigen ke bagaiyr khud ko kaid kar liya jaataa he
 These efforts include the use of depressant so that the user becomes unconscious due to natural panic and lack of oxygen
 ghutan ke jariye aatmahatya karne main saamanytah helium, argon or nitrogen kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 By rapidly inhaling inert gas, the person immediately becomes unconscious and dies within a few minutes
 hypothermia yaa thand se aatmahatya ek dhimi maut he jo kai charnon se hokar guzarati he
 The initial symptoms of hypothermia are mild which gradually takes moderate and severe forms
 isamen kaanpana, unmaad, matibhram samanvay kaa abhaav, garmi mahasoos hona or ant main maut shaamil ho sakati he
 a person's organs stop functioning, although medically brain death may take a long time
 electrocution ke jariye aatmahatya main apane aapako khatm karne ke liye ghaatak bijli ke jatke kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 This causes arrhythmias of the heart which means that there is no contraction of synergies between the various chambers of the heart and blood flow stops completely
 iske alaava vidyut dhara kii maatra ke anusaar sharir jhulas bhi saktaa he
 "the evidence here suggests that electrocution causes severe pain and extreme pain," oonchaai se kudane kaa matlab he unche sthanon se chalaang lagaana, udhaaharan ke liye kisi bahut unchi imaarat kii khidki, balakani yaa chat, unchi chattan, band yaa pul se kud janaa
 Leaping is one of the less common ways of committing suicide in the United States
 honkong main chalaang lagaana aatmahatya karne kaa sabase aam tarika he, 2006 main aatmahatya ke sabhi suchit maamalon main se 52
1% ne yahi tarika apanaaya tha or isse pehle ke saal main bhi aankada yahi tha
 The Center for Suicide Research and Prevention of the University of Hong Kong believes this may be due to the accessible abundance of skyscrapers in Hong Kong
 aatmahatya kaa ek aam tarika he aagneyastra kaa upyog karnaa
 a gunshot is usually aimed at the point-blanc range, often on the head or less commonly inside the mouth, under the chin or in the chest
 sanyukt rajya america main aagneyastra aatmahatya kaa sabase aam tarika he, 2003 main aatmahatya ke sabhi suchit maamalon main 53
7% ne yah tarika apanaaya tha
 When a person is shot, its position will depend on the velocity of the bullet, the energy available in the projectile and the interconnection of the tissue
 ek ucch urja kaa agneyastra or bandook kii nalee kaa sir kii ore upyukt dishaatmak jhukaav kaaphi vidhvansak nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he; kaaphi adhik raktasrav, mastishk ko gambhir kshati ke saath sthaayee rup se aanshik yaa purna bahu-bhagiya utak vidhwans, tantrika kshati or haddiyon ke tukdon ke dimaag main dhansane ke saath spasht rup se khopadi kii haddi kaa tootna; prabhavit hone vaali sambhavi sanrachanaon main antah kapaal, naadiyaan, madhya yaa aatanrik kaan, kapaal tantrika or vahya nalika sanrachanaayen shaamil ho sakati hai
 Low-capacity and low-power weapons are probably not successful in killing the victim despite the appropriate directional tilt of the tube
 aagneyastra ke zariye aatmahatya kaa ek asafal prayaas rogi ke liye gambhir sthaayee dard kii vajah ban saktaa he, saath hi ghati hui sangyanatmak kshamtaayen or peshiy kriyaayein mastishk kii sataha par rakt kaa jamaav, sir main bahari tatwon kaa pravesh, kapaly kosh main gas yaa vayujnya or dimaag or ridh main drav ke risaav kaa bhi kaaran ban saktaa he

 Research from the New England Journal of Medicine and the National Academy of Science found a relationship between domestic firearms ownership and suicide rates, although a study conducted by a researcher found between home ownership and suicide rates between 5–14-year-olds Apart from suicide, no significant correlation was found in statistical terms
 1980 ke dashak or aarambhik 1990 ke dashak main bandook dwaara kishoravastha main aatmahatya main tej badhottaree kii pravriti, saath hi 75 saal or usase zyaada kii umr vaale logon main kul milakar teevr vruddhi dekhi gayi
 Two separate studies conducted in Canada and Australia in relation to more restrictive firearms laws showed that although the stated law led to a decline in suicide by firearms, other methods such as hanging suicide increased
 australiya main to aatmahatya kii kul dar main vruddhi darj kii gayi or aatmahatya ke sambhavi peediton ko madad uplabdh karaane ke vishesh upayon ko lagu karne tak isamen koi kami nahin ai
 Research also indicates that there is no correlation in suicide rates to firearm versus law of keeping guns owned, and studies attempting to link gun ownership to potential victims often show the presence of gun ownership by others

 As with the other four ASD variants, self-expression is similar to AS as a sign and causes a possibility, but its diagnosis is allowed to impair communication and delay cognitive development; Many indications in Rhett syndrome and childhood disorder and self-expression are the same and pervasive developmental disorder is not otherwise specified when diagnosis is not made for a more specific disorder

 People with Asperger Syndrome, unlike self-expression, usually go to others themselves, even if shy and shy
 For example, a person with a PD can speak for a long time on a topic of their choice without recognizing the feelings or reactions of others
 This social clumsiness has been called "active but odd"

 Although no specific gene has yet been identified, there may be a number of reasons for the expression of the autism, with the observed variability in conditions of children suggestive of a genetic related tendency, the disease being the only ones in which families have behavioral relationships
 Symptoms are visible
 Minor difficulties in most research suggest that all autism spectrum disorders have genetic relatedness, but AS may have a stronger genetic component than these

 The biggest difficulty in diagnosing this disease is that it employs a number of different test instruments, such as the Syndrome Diagnostic Scale, Spectrum Screening Questionnaire, Spectrum Quotient, Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test, Gillin Asperger Disorder Scale
 But none shows a clear distinction between asds and ass
 
 Standard diagnostic criteria require repetitive and stereotypical patterns of social interaction and behavioral activities and interests, without significant delay in language or cognitive development

 Renowned composer AR Rahman has composed the background music and soundtrack for the film
 zubaida trayee main samaapan adhyay he jo mummo se shuru hua or saradari begum ke saath jari rahaa
 The film is based on the life of a failed actress Zubeida Begum, who married Hanwant Singh of the princely state of Jodhpur and was the mother of the film's writer
 is film ne hindi main sarvshereshth feechar film ke liye rashtriya film puraskaar jeeta or sarvshereshth abhinetri ke liye karishma kapur ko filmphere aword mila
 Zubaida is the story of Riyaz who discovers to understand his mother
 wo apni maan ko nahin jaanata he, kyonki vah apni maa kii anupasthiti main apni daadi dwaara paala gaya tha
 Her mother's name was Zubaida and she was the only daughter of a filmmaker named Suleman Seth
 zubaida gupt rup se filmon main kaam karti he, lekin jab uske pita ko pataa chalata he to vah uski shaadi mehboob alam se tay kar dete hai
 She gives birth to Riyaz

 Zubaida then meets Maharaja Vijayendra Singh of Fatehpur
 vijayendra pehle hi maharani mandira devi se shaadi kar chukaa he or do bacchon kaa pita he
 Still he is in love with Zubaida and they marry
 lekin unke rishte main nirantar uthal-puthal rahati he
 Riyaz knows through Zubaida's diary that although she loved Vijayendra dearly, she was unable to follow the rigid customs of the palace

 Uday Singh II was the Maharana of Mewar and the founder of the city of Udaipur, which is presently the state of Rajasthan
 ye mewar samrajya ke 53wein shaasha the udaisingh mewar ke shaasha maharana sanga ke chauthe putr the jabaki inaki mata kaa naam bundi kii rani rani karnavati tha
 Uday Singh was born in Chittorgarh in August 1522 and died in 1572, Ratan Singh II was appointed the new ruler, Ratna Singh ruled in 1531 after the death of his father Maharana Sanga
 rana vikramaditya singh ke shasankaal ke dauraan turki ke sultan gujarat ke bahadur shah ne chittorgarh par 1534 main hamalaa kar diya tha is kaaran udaisingh ko bundi bhej diya tha taaki udaisingh surakshit rah sake
 In 1537, Banveer strangled Vikramaditya to death and after that he tried to kill Uday Singh too, but Uday Singh's brother Panna Dhai sacrificed his son Chandan to save Uday Singh, due to which Uday Singh could live
 , Panna Dhai did not inform anyone that the person whom Banveer killed was not Uday Singh but his son Chandan
 iske baad panna dhai bundi main rahane lagi
 But Uday Singh was not allowed to come and meet
 or udaisingh ko khufia tareek se kumbhalgarh main 2 saalon tak rahanaa padaa tha
 After this, Uday Singh was crowned in Kumbhalgarh in 1540 and Rana of Mewar was made
 udaisingh ke sabase bade putr kaa naam maharana pratap tha jabaki pehali patni kaa naam maharani jaivantabai tha
 According to some legends, Uday Singh had a total of 22 wives and 56 sons and 22 daughters
 udaisingh kii duusari patni kaa naam sajja bai solanki tha jinhone shakti singh or vikram singh ko janm diya tha jabaki jagamaal singh ,chandakanvar or maakanwar ko janm dhirabai bhatiyani ne diya tha ,ye udaisingh kii sabase pasandida patni thi
 Apart from these, his fourth wife was Rani Virbai Jhala who gave birth to Jeth Singh

 After the death of thousands of Mewaris, when it felt that the stronghold would no longer survive, Uday Singh left it in the hands of the heroes like Jaimal and Fatta and went to the dense forests of Aravali

 yah lekh maithilisharan gupt kii rachana yashodhara ke vishay main he
 For Yashodhara, wife of Gautama Buddha, see Princess Yashodhara
 maithilisharan gupt dwaara rachit prasiddh prabandh kavy he jiskaa prakaashan san 1933 i
 main hua
 Maithilisharan Gupta wrote this book at the request of his younger brother Siyaramsharan Gupta
 yashodhara mahakavy main gautam buddha ke grih tyaag kii kahani ko kendra main rakhkar yah mahakavy likhaa gaya he
 In this, special importance has been given to the transcendental suffering of Yashodhara, the wife of Gautama Buddha
 yah gadhy-padya mishrit vidha he jise champookavy kaha jaataa he
 The purpose of Yashodhara is the euphemism of Yashodhara's heartfelt grief and the establishment of Vaishnava principles
 amitabh kii abha se chakit bhakton ko adrishy yashodhara kii pidaa kaa, maanviya sambandhon ke amar gayak, maanav-sulabh sahanubhuti ke pratishthapak maithilisharan gupt kii ant:praveshini drushti ne hi sarvapratham saakshaatkaar kiya
 At the same time, through 'yashodhara', on the renunciation, the householder head has the distinction of Vaishnavism

 They get frightened by the scenes of the slightest disease, death, etc

 Yashodhara's periodic viraha is extremely virtuous

 Isar understands but he does not even have the right to die because he is responsible for Rahul's upbringing
 falat: "anchal main doodh" or "aankhon main pani" liye vah jeevanyaapan karti he
 Upon attaining Siddhi, the Buddha returns, everyone welcomes him, but Manini Yashodhara stays in her room
 antat: swayan bhagwaan uske dwaar pahonchte hai or bheekh maangate hai
 Yashodhara gives him his invaluable fund to Rahul and also follows him
 is katha kaa purvarddh evam itihaas prasiddh he par uttararddh kavi kii apni urvar kalpana kii sristi he
 Shringar is the major rasa of 'yashodhara', the only beginning in Shringar

 Besides Shringar, Karun, Shanta and Vatsalya are also available in this place
 prastut kavy main chhayavaadi shilp kaa abhas he
 The utterance has been made miraculous and effective with amazing skills
 yashodhara kii bhashaa shuddh khadiboli he- praudhata, kantimayata or geetikavy ke upyukt mradulata or masrinataa uske vishesh gun hai, is prakaar yashodhara ek utkrisht rachana siddh hoti he
 Only from the point of view of crafts, it is also beautiful than 'saket'
 kavy-rup kii drushti se bhi 'yashodhara' gupt ji ke prabandh-kaushal kaa parichaayak he
 It is poetic - but not communicative
 charitrodghatan par kavi kii drushti kendrit rahane ke kaaran yah naatay-prabandh he, or ek bhaavnamayi nari kaa charitrodghatan hone se isamen pragitatmakataa kaa praadhanya he
 Therefore, 'yashodhara' should be called Pragmatikatya Natya Prabandha, which is an absolutely traditional poetic form
 yashodhara kaa virah atyant darun he or siddhi maarg kii baadha samajhi jane kaa kaaran to uske aatmgaurav ko badi thes lagati he
 But she is not willing to accept femininity as inferior in any way
 vah bhartiya patni he, uskaa ardhangi-bhav sarvatra mukhar he- "usamen meraa bhi kuch hoga jo kuch tum paaoge
 "all in all Yashodhara is the ideal wife, superior mother and self-sufficient woman
 parantu gupt ji ne yathasambhav gautam ke paramparaagat udaatt charitra kii raksha kii he
 Although the poet has rejected his beliefs and principles, in the end he has made 'yashodhara' and 'rahul' a follower to protect his famous form
 prastut kavy main vastu ke sanghatak or vikaas main rahul kaa samdhik mahatva he
 If Rahul had not been in the red lap, then perhaps Yashodhara would have chosen death and then why this 'yashodhara' would have been implemented
 'yashodhara' kavy main rahul kaa manovikas ankit he
 He has amazing charm in childlike efforts
 samay ke saath-saath uski buddhi kaa vikaas bhi hota he, jo uski uktiyon se spasht he
 But all this cannot be said as natural
 kahin kahin to rahul praundhon ke samaan tark, yuktipurvak vaartalap karata he, jo janmajaat pratibhasampann balak ke prasang main bhi nishchay hi atiranjana he
 Yashodhara is a character-oriented poem
 is granth kii rachana kaa uddeshy hi upekshita yashodhara ke charitra ko ubhaarna he
 It is proved from the naming of poetry that Yashodhara is the main character of this poetry
 usee kii karun gaatha ko goonthne ke uddeshy se guptaji ne is kavy kii rachana kii he
 It is known from these lines that- yashodhara ke virahinee rup par bhi kavi ne zyada prakaash daalaa he
 Virhini Gopa sheds tears day and night
 use jaan padataa he ki uskaa janm keval rone ke liye hua he
 The eyes of that immortal life are always full of water, and that is why she gives her husband a look
 rahul ke saamne rone se rahul ko ksht hota he, isiilie vah uske so jane ke baad hi ji bharkar krandan karti he
 In this way, she cuts the night weeping
 uske netron se neend sadaa ke liye vidaa ho gai he
 When Gautama Buddha left, Yashodhara remembers his predecessor and says - unmaad kii sthiti main yashodhara 'jaao mere sir ke bal' kahkar apane edichambi sundar keshon ko kaat daalati he or rahul ko apane bahupash main itane jor se jakad leti he ki uskaa dam ghutane lagata he
 In fact, the unhappiness of separation becomes inevitable when - "I wake up
 " vah apane vanamali ko bulaati he- vah bhi jaldi kyonki use bhay he ki kahin 'aankhon kaa panchi' unke aane se purv hi na ud jaay, kintu gopa ko turant hi bodh hota he ki sneh to jalane ke liye bana he or yah deh sab kuch sahane ke liye bani he
 Yashodhara's tears are so valuable that Shuddhodhana is ready to leave him to 'mukti Mukta'
 virahinee yashodhara vrath rakhti he, fate-puraane vastra pahenti he
 Thus Yashodhara, deprived of royalty, is living only in the concern of Gautama
 'na jane kitni barasaatein biit gai' par gopa ke din nahin phire
 She assesses the value of happiness with heat and cold breath
 use vishwaas he ki uske khalane vaale din avashya cat jaayenge or khilne vaale din avashya aayenge or tab vah ek din prabhu kaa darshan avashya kar paayenge
 That is why she sometimes refuses to let her nayana be in vain because she feels that there is nothing in this cry
 anuraagini ke rup mem yashodhara kaa charitra nikhar uthaa he
 The specialty of her character is that despite being anuragini, she is a human being
 vah apane pati se jitna anuraag rakhti he utana bhi maan rakhti he
 In fact, she is a worshiper of her husband-god like Meera
 vaishnav-bhakthi main maan, darp, upalambh aadi ko mahatvapurn sthaan diya gaya he
 Yashodhara also has a statement- yashodhara kaa janani rup uske anuraagini rup se bhi adhik mukherit he
 The only support for a woman separated from her husband is her son
 yashodhara kii 'malin gooddi kaa laal', 'uske sharir kaa anraag', 'aankhon kaa anjan', 'vipakti kaa sahaara', 'jivan-naiya kaa khivaiyaa', 'dukhini kaa sukh', 'uskaa bhaiya', 'uskaa raja' sabhi kuch rahul he
 If Gautam has snatched up this support of hers, she too would walk through the jungles of the forest like Vaishali, the heroine of Shri Govindavallabh Pant's drama 'varmala'
 iske atirikt use saas-sasur kii samvednaa or sahanubhuti praapt na hoti, to vah kabhi kii kaal ke gaal main samaa gai hoti
 Yashodhara lives because Rahul's weight is on him and his mother-in-law's sympathy is with him
 yashodhara kavy main jis prakaar yashodhara kaa janani rup nikharaa he usee prakaar uskaa maanini rup bhi
 When Lord Buddha came to Magadha after receiving Gyan, Shuddhodhana and Mahaprajavati explain to Yashodhara many times that she should submit to her husband's darshan
 kintu vah iske liye prastut nahin hoti
 She realizes that she has not left her husband
 uske pati hi usase chhipakar ghar se nikal gaye
 So they should come to him only
 jab uske saas sasur usase magadh chalane kaa aagrah karte jate hai to maanini yashodhara aavesh main aakar moorchhit ho jaati hai
 When Gautam Buddha visits Kapilavastu, Manini is now sitting where her loved ones have left her
 vah samajhaati he ki jab unhen isht hoga tab swayan aakar yaa bulaakar ve use apane charnon main sthaan denge
 This is also what happens

 Pepperoni salami is an italian-american spicy food often prepared from cured meats of pigs and cows, but if properly named it can also be made from chicken meat, which will be less expensive
 It is developed from spicy salads of southern Italy, such as the Salicacia Napoletana Picante of Naples or the Spicy Sausages of Sopreseta of Calabria
