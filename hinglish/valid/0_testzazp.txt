 naad kaa shabdic arth he -1
 shabd, dhwani, aawaaj
 According to the acharyas of music, Naad originated from the combination of Akashstha Agni and Marut
 jahaan praan kii sthiti rahati he use brahmagranthi kehete hai
 It is written in Sangeetdarpan that the Chitta Dehaj strikes the fire by being inspired by the soul and Agni inspires the cosmic life

 Along with the development of modern chemical and industrial knowledge, chemical dynamics or 'reaction kinetics' has developed rapidly
 iske falswaroop rasinic pratikriya gativigyaan keval prayogshaalaon main simit na rahakar ab audyogic sanyantr kaa ek ang ban gaya he
 Industrial production is done by many chemical reactions
 at: rasinic udyog main in kriyaaon kaa atyant mahatv hota he
 Establishment and development of chemical industries is not possible in the modern era only with the initial knowledge of chemical activities, especially when there is a strong emphasis on low cost production
 at: aadhunik kaal main pratikriya gativigyaan kaa gahan adhyayan keval prayogshaala kaa vishay na hokar audyogic kshetra kaa pramukh vishay ban gaya he
 The main reason for the growth and development in the field of reaction kinetics is the development of thermodynamics
 mukhya lekh rasinic abhikriya kii dar The change in the quantity of a product in unit time in a chemical reaction is called the rate of that reaction
 rasinic kriya kaa adhyayan do pramukh ritiyon se kiya jaataa he
 In this way, attention is given to the initial and final chemical changes of chemical activity
 is reeti se adhyayan main rasinic kriya kii samyavastha paristhitiyon par tathaa in paristhitiyon ke muulyankan par vishesh dhyaan diya jaataa he
 This method of study is based on fixed and rigorous principles similar to the laws of mathematics
 kisi rasinic kriya kaa is reeti se adhyayan evam vishleshan ooshmaa gativigyaan par aadhaarit hota he
 The second method of studying chemical reactions relates to the other complex aspect of chemical change, in which special emphasis is given to the speed and conditions of the chemical reaction to its initial and final stages
 is adhyayan kaa rasinic udyogon main bahut mahatv hota he tathaa iskaa sambandh kriya kii un asthaayee evam asamyavastha kii paristhitiyon se hota he, jinke madhya hokar rasinic kriya purnataa ko praapt hoti he athwa antim avasthaa tak pahunchati he
 In this way, strict rules like mathematics are not followed literally in the study, but more attention is given to the practical side of the verb
 at: is reeti se adhyayan karne se praapt tathy lagbhag satya hota he tathaa kabhi kabhi maatraatmak na hokar keval gunatmak hota he
 The study of chemical activity in this manner is called action scientific study
 rasinic kriya ke adhyayan kii donon reetiyaan ek duusare se paraspar sambandhit hoti he
 In fact, in the study of chemical action, heat kinetics are similar to the cornerstone, on which action kinetics are similar to the cornerstone, on which action kinetics are built
 kisi rasinic kriya ke prarambh tathaa antim avasthaa tak pahunchne kii gati ke adhyayan main kriya ke praarambhik evam antim avasthaaon kaa gyaan tathaa ek duusare kii saapeksh sthirataa, athwa kriya ke saapeksh santulan ke str kaa gyaan, atyaavashyak hota he
 Through heat kinetics, the conduction potential of chemical action, indicating the nature of the change from one state of the chemical-mechanism to another, can be known and ascertained
 kisi rasinic kriya kii gati ke adhyayan ke purv yah gyaat karnaa aavashyak hota he ki kriya ke liye upyukt paristhiti vidyaman he athwa nahin
 The conduction potential of a chemical action is indicative of the appropriate state of action, but the nature of the amount of conduction potential only tells
 vastav main vyaavhaarik str par vah kriya sambhav he athwa nahin, athwa yadi kriya vastav main ho to uski gati kya hogi, is sambandh main kuch bhi gyaat nahin hota he
 The speed of a chemical change generally depends on two factors
 inamen se pratham kaarak pratyaksh rup se chaalan bal athwa vibhav par tathaa dwitiya kaarak pratilom rup main avrodh par nirbhar karata he
 In the kinetics of chemical reaction, the correlation of the two above mentioned factors is very important
 rasinic-kriya-pranali main rasinic parivartan ke prati avrodh kii prakruti kii maap ko sakriyakaran urja kaha jaataa he
 The activation energy does not depend on the conduction potential of the action, or the energy of the independent action
 parshv chitra main rasinic kriya kii sakriyan urja tathaa chaalan vibhav ke antar ko spasht karne main ek yantric saadrishy kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 The molecules of the mechanism that participate in chemical activity are located at different levels of energy
 saamanyat: taap main vruddhi hone se kriya kii gati teevr ho jaati he
 Similarly in the presence of a catalytic material, the activation energy in the state of action decreases, which increases the speed of action by increasing the reactivity of the molecule
 udaahranarth, hydrogen tathaa oxigen gas kii rasinic kriyapranali main, in donon tatwon ke sanyog se jal kii utpatti kriya ke liye yah aavashyak hota he ki in donon gaison kaa unnayan sankriyan avasthaa main kiya jaay
 The activation-up-gradation of the molecules of hydrogen and oxygen gas can be generated by the reduction of the activation energy by the use of electromagnetic pulsing, or by the use of catalytic material, to generate water from the synthesis of hydrogen and oxygen at normal temperature
 
 sanshleshan kriya ke uparaant jal ke rup main kriyapranali samyavastha ke nimnatar str par sthit hoti he, jo sthaayee paristhiti kaa parichaayak hota he
 In the opposite action of the above mentioned action, that is, in the process of water dissolution, the activation energy, whose volume is equal to the combined energy and conduction energy, is required
 sakriyan urja kii yah maatra uplabdh hone par jal vighatan kii kriya dwaara jal se hydrogen tathaa oxigen gas kaa utpaadan hota he
 Therefore, in the case of suitable action, the action of water production by combining hydrogen and oxygen gas is considered more favorable, while the adverse action of hydrolysis is not favorable in the above situation
 kriyagatiki kaa audyogic upkarnon ke abhikalp evam utpaadan main vishesh mahatv hota he
 Therefore, the experimental material used in instrument design is obtained first by controlled experiments
 niyantrit paristhiti main ye prayog sarvapratham prayogshaala main, taduparant nideshak sanyantr tathaa kabhi kabhi bade aakaar ke audyogic sanyantron main, pareekshan chaalan ke dwaara kiye jate hai
 The experimental material used in the construction of the director plant is collected by preliminary experiments in the laboratory
 kisi rasinic kriya ke gatinirdhaaran main kriya ke vishleshan kaa vishesh mahatv hota he
 The methods of analysis of chemical activity are divided into three major categories
 vishleshan kii pratham reeti main, kriyapranali ke mishran se vibhinn tathaa nishchit samay ke antar par, mishran namoonay ko nikaala jaataa he tathaa is mishran namoonay main or rasinic kriya na ho, athwa kam se kam ho, is hetu ise shighrata se thanda kar liya jaataa he, tathaa kriya ke uparaant praapt honevaale utpaadon kii maatra gyaat kii jaati he
 In the second method of chemical reaction analysis, chemical reaction is initiated simultaneously in several samples of the reaction mixture and at different and fixed times, one mixture sample after the other is cooled, so that the action in that fraction of the action mixture And minimum, and this fraction is chemically analyzed
 vishleshan kii tritiy reeti main kriya mishran se bina mishran namoonay nikaale bhautikeey rasinic ritiyon ke prayog dwaara kriya ke praarambhik padaartho evam kriya ke uparaant nirmit honevaale padaartho kii maatra ko gyaat kiya jaataa he
 In this type of physical chemical methods, light polarimetry is arranged in the following three major forms of colorimetric spectrometry spectrometry
 is prakram vyavastha ko kramash: sthir aaytan, ghaan prakram, pravaah prakram tathaa sthir dabaav ghaan prakram kaha jaataa he
 In the laboratory, experimental material is usually collected by first class process arrangement
 is varg kii prakriya vyavasthaayen, un prakriyaaon ko chhodkar jinamein dabaav main bahut parivartan hota he, jaise gas kii prakriyaaon main hota he, saamanyat: saral evam pratyaksh hoti hai
 In the experiments of the director plant, experimental process material is usually collected from the process arrangement of the second class
 is varg kii prayogvyavastha se praapt saamagree kaa pratyaksh upyog audyogic prakriya paatr ke pravaah prakramon main kiya jaataa he
 The experimental method of third-class process arrangement is very complex, so its use is limited
 is varg kii prakriya vyavastha main prakriya pranali ke aaytan main parivartan ke dwaara sthir dabaav kii avasthaa ko banaae rakhaa jaataa he
 This task is very difficult, especially in those actions in which phase changes occur
 mul rup main rasinic kriyaaon ko do samoohon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 The first group consists of homogeneous verbs, which have only one phase in their system
 duusare samooh kii vishmang kriyaaon main ek se adhik pravasthaon kii upasthiti hoti he
 The whole chemical action is called heterogeneous action due to the inter-level interaction of the catalytic substances and the mechanism of action in the catalytic reactions
 rasinic kriyaaon kaa pravaah athwa dhan prakramon, ke rup main bhi vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 In the flow process, the state of steady state is obtained, so that there is no change in terms of time in the activity of constant volume
 is prakaar ke kriya prakam main kriya ke uparaant nirmit honevaale padaartho kaa pranali main samay ke sandarbh main parivartan hota he
 In the process system, the substances participating in the action are mixed and kept for a certain time to allow the action to take place
 is avadhi ke samaapt hone ke uparaant utpaada padaartho ko pranali se pruthak kiya jaataa he
 Verbs are also classified based on the states in which the action occurs
 samooshmaa kriya main kriya ke falswaroop nishkasit ooshmaa ko hataaya jaataa, athwa ooshmaa avasorana kii avasthaa main ushma pradaay ke dwaara kriya ke taap ko sthir rakhaa jaataa he
 On the other hand, insulating the system can block the transfer of action
 is prakaar kii kriya ko ruddhoshm kriya kaha jaataa he
 There is no change in the volume of the system when a verb is allowed in a rigid verb
 is paristhiti kii kriya ke sthir dabaav kii pravastha main sampann hone par kriya ko sthir dabaav kii kriya kaha jaataa he
 Generally the action of static volume is related to the flow process and the action of constant pressure is related to the flow process
 kriya gativigyaan kii drushti se donon dishaao main honevaali kriyaaon ko utkramntic kriya kaha jaataa he tathaa ek hi disha main hone vaali kriya ko ekadishiya athwa anutkramntic kriya kaha jaataa he
 In the field of heat kinetics, reversible action is analyzed from a different perspective
 ooshmaa gativigyaan ke anusaar pruthak kriyapranali kii sabhi kriyaayein anutkramntic hoti hai
 Therefore, in verb dynamics, reversible action has a completely different meaning from heat kinetics
 band kriyapranali main kriya karanevaale sabhi padaartho ke pruthakkaran se prayek kriya ko saidhantik rup main, kriya gativigyaan se utkramntic kriya banaaya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, every action is initially unidirectional
 vipareet kriya kii paristhiti main kriya ke uparaant praapt honevaale utpaada kii maatra main kami ho jaati he
 Therefore, reversible actions are not allowed to happen as far as possible
 utkramntic kriyaaon main kriya ke uparaant nirmit honevaale utpaada padaartho main se kisi ek ko yadi kriyapranali se hataa diya jaay to utkramntic kriya ekadishiya kriya kii bhanti hone lagati he
 The study of chemical reactions based on heat kinetics makes it clear that the speed of action is proportional to the active concentration of each molecule participating in the action
 yadi kisi a tathaa b naamak padaartho main kriya ho tathaa unke anuon kii sakriy sandratha kramash: a tathaa b or kriya ke uparaant utpaada padaarth r tathaa s ke anuon kii sakriy sandratha kramash: r tathaa s ho to is kriya ko nimnaankit rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : aa + bb rr + ss uparyukt kriya main agragami kriya kii gati nimnaankit hoti he Speed of the leading verb = kf
 ab { \ displaystyle kf
 { \ left ^ {a} \ left ^ {b}}} is sameekaran main kf = kriya gati sthiraank; { \ displaystyle \ left} = kriya mishran main b sanghatak kii sakriya sandratha or a tathaa b kramash: kriya ke a or b sanghatakon ke anuon kii sankhya ko vyakt karte hai
 Speed of opposite action on the above basis = kb
 rs { \ displaystyle kb
 { \ left ^ {r} \ left ^ {s}}}; samyavastha kii paristhiti main agragami tathaa pratigaami kriyaaon kii gati samaan ho jaati he, jisase sampurna kriya kii gati shunya ho jaati he
 So in a situation of equilibrium samyavastha sthiraank : k = kf / kb = r s a b { \ displaystyle ={ \ frac { \ left^{r} \ left^{s}}{ \ left^{a} \ left^{b xxrep 4 } Arrhenius equation, see rasinic kriya main taap anivak gati kii maap hota he
 Therefore, by increasing the temperature of the action, the energy of the activity also increases and with the increase in the energy of the activity, the activity gets faster
 aarinius ke siddhant ke anusaar taap tathaa sakriyan urja ke saath kriyagati main vruddhi kaa nimnaankit sambandh hota he : In this equation, k expresses the action constant, a proportional constant, Ea activation energy, t temperature and r universal gas constant
 kriya main taap ke alp parivartan kii paristhiti main a tathaa Ea praaia: sthiraank hote hai
 In most homogeneous chemical reactions occurring at normal temperatures, 100 c in heat
 With the increase of, the action constant is often doubled
 pravaah prakram kii kriyaaon main kriyapaatr ke aaytan tathaa pradaayagati kaa anupaat sthangati se sambandhit hota he
 The speed of the volume supplied in the verb and the correlation of the volume of the verb is called the position of the verb
 ek saath honevaali anek kriyaayein 3⁄4 kisi rasinic kriya main bhaag lenevaale jab kuch athwa sabhi padaarth ek samay main hi ek se adhik kriya karte hon, to kriya kaa gatik sameekaran atyant jatil ho jaataa he
 Therefore, the point-line method is used in the study of the dynamics of many such actions occurring simultaneously
 is prakaar kii kriyaaon main kriya ke uparaant nirmit honevaale padaartho kii sahakriya ke kaaran nae tathaa atirikt padaartho kaa utpaadan hota he
 The chain of trailing verbs, in which the frequency of the verbs is repeated, is called a series verb
 is prakaar kii shrinkhalabaddh kriyaayein kabhi kabhi bahut lambii hoti hai
 Therefore, the chain actions against negative catalytic substances, or inhibitory substances, are highly sensitive, since the entire chain of thousands of molecules depends on a single molecule
 shrinkhalabaddh kriyaaon kaa saralatam udhaaharan prakaash ke sanyog main hydrogen tathaa chlorine gas kii sanshleshan kriya he, jiske falswaroop hydrogen chloride kaa utpaadan hota he
 In this action, the action is done by a garland of the following actions: Cl2 + prakaash-avasorana --> 2cl Cl + H2 -> hcl + h h + Cl2 --> hcl + Cl Cl + H2 -> hcl + h kriya main prakaash ke avasorana se jaise hi parmanivak chlorine kaa nirmaan hota he, yah hydrogen ke saath kriya karke parmanivak hydrogen kaa utpaadan karata he, jo pun: chlorine ke saath kriya karke parmanivak chlorine ko mukt karata he or is prakaar kriya kaa yah krambaddh vikaas hota rahata he, jisase hydrogen chloride kii maatra main kramash: vruddhi hoti jaati he
 Generally, most heterogeneous activities are found in the area of actions catalyzed by the use of catalysts
 is saamaanya dhaaran main bhi anek apwaad paae jate hai
 Functional substances of different phases are present in the mechanism of many heterosexual activities
 ethilin oxide tathaa jal kii parsparik kriya se ethilin glykol banataa he
 This action is performed as follows: C2H4O + H2O --> C2 H4 2 The above mentioned verb is poisonous verb
 vibhinn pravasthawali vishmang kriyaaon main kriya-gati-vigyaan kaa sanyantr samang kriyaaon kii bhanti keval rasinic karkon par hi nirbhar karata he, varanaa bhautikeey tathaa rasinic donon hi karkon par nirbhar karata he
 Thus diffusion is a very important factor in poisonous actions
 vishmang kriyaaon kaa gati-vigyaan-vishleshan atyant jatil hota he
 Because the functions of all phases have to be analyzed simultaneously, so from the industrial point of view, only empirical methods are used in the analysis of all actions
 kanchanajangha, vishwa kii teesri sabase unchi parvat chotii he, yah sikkim ke uttar pashchim bhaag main nepal kii seemaa par he
 The name Kanchenjunga derives from four words of Tibetan origin, usually spelled kang-chhen-dajo -anga or yang-chhen-djo-riga

 Sigmund Freud was the neurologist of Austria and the founder of psychoanalysis
 sigmund frid kaa janm austria-hungary samrajya ke freeberg shahar main hua
 His parents were Jewish
 frid ke pita oon ke vyapaaree the or mata inke pita kii teesri patni thim
 Freud was the eldest of his seven siblings
 3 saal kii umr main frid ke pita lipjig aa gaye or uske ek saal baad vienna chale gaye, jahaan ve kareeb 80 saalon tak rahe
 Freud did his Doctor of Medicine in 1881 from the University of Vienna
 san 1938 main hitler ke naaji vidroh ke kaaran frid bhagkar landan chale gaye
 He died in London in September 1939
 unnisvin sadi ke armbh ke kuch samay pehle manovigyaan ek swatantra vigyaan ke rup main viksit hua
 Earlier, psychology was studied under philosophy
 us vakt manovigyaan kaa uddeshy vayask maanav kii chetana kaa vishleshan or adhyayan karnaa tha
 Freud opposed this traditional "psychology of consciousness" and proposed many new psychoanalytic concepts on which our modern psychology rests
 frid ke praarambhik jivan ko dekhne par ham pate hai ki armbh se hi unka jhukaav tantrika vigyaan kii ore tha
 Between 1873 and 1881, he got in touch with the then famous neurologist Ernst Brucki
 frid, ernest bruki se prabhavit hue or unki prayogshaala main kaary prarambh kiya
 After publishing several research papers in physiology and neuroscience, Freud separated from Ernst Brookey and started his private business as a physician
 san 1881 main frid ne vienna vishvavidhyalay se em
di kii oopaadhi praapt kii
 Shortly before this, Freud had contact with Joseph Brewer
 frid ne joseph briuvar ke saath shodhpatr "studies in histyria" likhaa
 "studies in hysteria" was based on the analysis of a patient, whose fictitious name was "anna O"
 yah mana jaataa he ki isi shodhpatr main manovishleshanvaad ke beej chhipe hue the
 This research became very famous
 san 1896 main briuvar tathaa frid main peshewar asahmati hui or ve alag ho gayi
 1900 was the most important year in Freud's life
 isi varsh unki bahucharchit pustak "interpratation of dream" kaa prakaashan hua, jo unke or unke rogiyon ke swapnon ke vishleshan ke aadhaar par likhi gai thi
 In this, he told that dreams are a reflection of our unquenchable desires
 is pustak ne unhen prasiddh bana diya
 Many contemporary intellectuals and psychologists were attracted to him
 inamen karl jung, alfred edler, oto rank or sandoor francji ke naam pramukh he
 Freud had a good contact with all these people, but later there were differences and people separated from them
 san 1909 main clark vishwa vidhyalay ke mashhoor manovigyaani ji
es
 haal dwaara frid ko manovishleshan par vyaakhyaan dene kaa nimantran praapt hua, jo unki prasiddhi main mile kaa pathar sabit hua
 isamen frid ke alaava yung, vril, jones, ferenkaji tathaa kai anya mashhoor manovigyaani upasthit the
 Freud soon returned from here, because he did not like the atmosphere of America
 Here Freud was complaining of stomach upset, which he attributed to various American foods
 jung or edler, frid ke manovishleshanvaad ke kai binduon se sahamat the
 But he rejected Freud's excessive emphasis on sex
 isse alag-alag samay main ve donon bhi inase alag ho gaye
 Jung emphasized the interference of cultural heritage in psychoanalysis and Adler emphasized sociality
 yadhyapi yah sahi he kii peshewar sahakarmi unase ek-ek kar alag ho rahe the phir bhi unki prasiddhi ko isse koi fark nahi padaa
 In 1923, cancer was detected in Freud's mouth, due to which he was told to drink more cigars than necessary
 san 1933 main hitler ne germany kii satta par kabza kar liya
 He clearly stated that he has no place in the power for Freud's suit
 hitler ne frid kii sari pustakon or hastlipiyon ko jala diya
 He probably would have behaved even worse, but after political pressure and the intervention of the then American ambassador, Hitler forcefully signed a paper asking Freud not to misbehave with him
 iske baad unhen vienna chhodkar landan jane kaa aadesh diya
 He received a grand reception in London
 unhen turant hi royal socity kaa sadsy bana liya gaya
 Here he published his last book "moses and Monethism"
 frid ne man yaa vyaktitv ke swarup ko gatyaatmak mana he
 According to him personality is the name of our brain and body functions
 frid ke maansik tatv hote hai jo chetan main nahin aa pate yaa sammohan athwa chetana lop kii sthiti main chetan main aate hai
 It contains the wishes related to childhood, sexual desires and mental conflicts, etc
, which the person himself does not even know
 inhen saamanytah vyakti apane pratidin kii jindagi main puraa nahi kar paata or ye vikrut rup dhaaran karke yaa to sapanom ke rup main yaa phir unmaad ke daure ke rup main vyakti ke saamne upasthit hoti hai
 According to Freud, the dynamic side of personality is formed by three stages - idan kii utpati manushya ke janm ke saath hi ho jaati he
 Freud considered it to be the most important part of the personality
 isaki vishaywastu ve icchhaaen hai jo libdo se sambandhit hai or taatkaalik santushti chaahati hai
 The growth of energy is not able to bear it and if it does not get expression properly then it affects the person by wearing a distorted form
 aham frid ke liye swa-chetana kii tarah thi jise usne maanav ke vyavhaar kaa dwitiyak niamak bataaya
 It is an organized part of IDE, its purpose is to pursue the goals of IDE
 para aham ek prakaar kaa vyavhaar pratimaanak hota he, jisase naitik vyavhaar niojit hote hai
 It develops relatively late
 frid ke vyaktitv sambandhi vichaaron ko manolangik vikaas kaa siddhant bhi kaha jaataa he
 Freud divided it into 5 stages - inhi ke aadhaar par usne vivaadaaspad electra or odipus complex kii avadharana di jiske anusaar shishu kii langik shakti prarambh main khud ke liye prabhavi hoti he, jo dhire -dhire duusare vyaktion kii ore unmukh hoti he
 That is why sons are more attracted towards mother and daughter more towards father
 iske kaaran ladakon main mata ke prati prem or pita ke prati pratidwandita utpann hoti he, jise frid dwaara odipus complex kaa naam diya
 This has been a very controversial and popular concept
 frid in sankalpanaaon kii satyata sabit karne ke liye aankade nahi de paae
 un par aalochakon ne yah aarope lagaaya kii unhone apane anubhavon ko in prekshanon ke saath mishrit kiya he or jo kuch bhi unke rogiyon ne kaha us par unhone aankh band kar vishwaas kiya he
 Freud also faced accusations that he was over-imagining psychology and mixing mythological texts, giving sexual needs more space than necessary
 frid ke kaary or un par aadhaarit unki manyataon ke dekhne par ham yah pate hai ki frid ne maanav kii pashavik pravriti par zarurat se adhik bal daalaa tha
 He made it clear that many of the qualities and characteristics of inferior animals are also seen in humans
 unke dwaara paribhaashit mul pravriti kii sankalpana bhi iske antargat aati he
 Freud was of the opinion that no change can be brought about in the nature of an adult person because the foundation of his personality is found in childhood, which cannot be changed in any way
 However, later research has proved that humans are fundamentally future oriented
 ek shaikshik manovigyaani ke samaan frid ke manovigyaan main krambaddhata nahin dikhaai detii parantu unhone manovigyaan ko ek nai paribhaasha di jiske aadhaar par ham aadhunik manovishleshanatmak manovigyaan ko khadaa pate hai or tamaam aalochanaon ke baad bhi asaamaanya manovigyaan or naidanik manovigyaan main frid ke yogadan ko andekha nahi kiya ja sakaata
 The cult of psychoanalysis propounded by Freud was very popular due to its popularity
 Freud wrote several books, among which "inter pretation of Dreams", "group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego", "totem and Taboo" and "civilizations and Its Discontents" are prominent

 vrittasur kaa vadh karne ke kaaran indrako brahmahatya kaa dosha laga or ve is mahadosh kekaaran swarg chhodkar kisi agyaat sthaan menja chupe
 Indrasan could not remain empty, so the gods combined Nahusha, the godly king of the earth, to the post of Indra
 nahush abasamast devtaa, rishi or gandharvon seshakti praapt kar swarg kaa bhoga karne lage
 Suddenly one day his eyes fell on Indra's sadhvi wife Shachi
 shachi ko dekhte hi vekamandh ho uthe or use praapt karne kaa harasambhav praytn karne lage
 When Shachi was aware of Nahusha's evil intentions, she got scared and went to the shelter of dev-guru Brihaspati and said about Nahusha's libido, "O Gurudev! Now only you protect my nature
 ” guru brihaspati ne santvana di, “heindrani! tum chintaa na karo
 Stay here with me, be safe in all ways
 ” In this way, Shachi started living near Gurudev and got Brihaspati to search for Indra
 ant messgnidev ne ek camel kii naal main sookshm rup dharankarke chupe huye indra ko khoj nikaala or unhendevguru brihaspati ke paas le aaye

 In this way, once Indra's conviction of Brahm slaying was redressed, he again became full of power, but due to Nahush being on Indrasana, his full power could not be regained

 modulan ek weveform ke sambandh main duusare weveform se alag karne kii prakriya he
 In telecommunications, modulation is used to send a message, but a composer uses it to separate the volume, timing or timing, and accentuation of an instrument's tone for vocal harmony
 aksar ucch aavruti sinusoid weveform kaa istemaal lo-frequency sanket ke karier sanket ke rup main hota he
 There are three major parameters of a sine wave - its own amplitude, its phase and its frequency, all of these communication signals can be modified based on low frequency to obtain a modulated signal
 jo upkaran adhimishran ko anjaam detaa he modulator kehalaata he or jo upkaran vipareet kriya karata he demodulator kehalaata he
 The device that can do both types of tasks is called a modem
 ankiy adhimishran kaa uddeshy ankiy bit stream ko ek anuroop pasband channel main sthaanantaran karnaa he, udhaahranswaroop; saarvajanik switchd telephone network,, yaa ek simit radio frequency band par sthaanantaran karnaa he
 The purpose of analog modulation is to transfer an analog baseband signal, for example to transfer an audio signal or TV signal to an analog passband channel, another example is to limit the radio frequency band or cable TV network channel
 anuroop or ankiy adhimishran frequency divijan multiplexing, ko aasaan banaata he, jabaki isi ke saath kai lo-paas soochna sanket kaa sthaanantaran ek saajhe bhautik madhyam se alag pasband channelon kaa upyog kar ke jariye hota he
 Digital baseband modulation systems, also called line coding, also aim to transfer a baseband channel over a digital bit stream via a serial bus or wire-connected local area network such as a non-filter-copper wire
 pulse adhimishran pranali kaa uddeshy ek nairoband anuroop sanket ko sthaanantarit karnaa he, udhaahranswarup phone kol kaa wideband besaband channel par aana, yaa kuch yojanaon main beet stream kaa ek duusare ankiy transmishan system main aana
 In analog modulation, the modulation on the analog information signal is continuous
 saamaanya anuroop adhimishran takanic nimna prakaar ke hote hai : In digital modulation, the analog carrier signal is modulated by a digital bit flow
 ankiy adhimishran paddati main ankiy se anuroop roopantaran ho saktaa he or demodyulation yaa ditection main anuroop se ankiy main roopantaran ho saktaa he
 Changes in the carrier signal are chosen from a finite number of m option symbols
 ek saamaanya udhaaharan : ek telephone line ko shravan yogya dhwani ko sthanantarit karne ke liye dizine kiya gaya he, udhaaharan ke liye ek tone ko len, yah ankiy bits nahin he
 This is why computers can connect to the telephone via modems, which represent digital bits by tones, called symbols
 agar vahaan chaar vikalp ke pratik hai, pehla pratik bit seqvence 00 kaa pratinidhitiv kar saktaa he, isi tarah doosraa 01 ko, teesraa 10 or chauthaa 11
 agar kisi modem main 1000 tone prati second vaala sangeet bajataa he, to iskaa pratik dar 1000 pratik / prati second, yaa bod hoga
 chunki is udhaaharan main harek tone do ankiy bits vaala ek massej kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, isliye bit dar pratik dar kaa duguna yani 2000 bits prati second hota he
 According to one definition of a digital signal, the modulated signal is a digital signal, but in another definition, modulation is also called the conversion from digital to analog
 zyaadaatar pathyapustakon main ankiy adhimishran skim ko ankiy transmishan ke rup main, data transmishan kaa hi paryaay maan liya gaya he, bahut kam pathyapustakon main ise anuroop transmishan kaha gaya he
 The most fundamental digital modulation techniques are as follows: QAM main, ek infez sanket or ek kshetrakalan charan aayam ek parimit sankhya main abhivyakt hoti he
 This can be seen as a two-channel system, with each channel using ASK
 parinamswaroop sanket PSK or ASK donon ke sammishran ke baraabar hota he
 In each of the above methods, each phase, frequency or amplitude is dictated by an amazing double beats pattern
 aamtaur par, harek charan frequency yaa aayam kii saamaan sankhya ke beats kaa kutalekhan karti he
 The symbol included in this number of bits is represented by a particular phase
 yadi varnmaala main m = 2 n { \ displaystyle M=2^{N}} vaikalpik pratik ke rup main shaamil he to harek pratik n bits ke sandesh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 If the symbol rate f s { \ displaystyle f_ {S}} is the symbol per second, the data rate is n f s { \ displaystyle Nf_ {S}} beats per second
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek varnmaala jisame 16 vaikalpik pratik hai, harek pratik 4 bits kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Therefore the data rate will be four times the baud rate
 PSK, ASK yaa QAM, jahaan adhimishrit sanket kii carrier frequency sthir he vahaan adhimishran varnmaala aksar aasaani se raashi rekhachitr kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, harek sanket ke liye aayam ke i sanket ko x-axis or q sanket ko y-axis dwaara darshata he
 PSK and ASK using the principle of QAM, but sometimes FSK are also frequently generated and detected
 i or q sanket ko jatil-maan sanket i +jq main joda ja saktaa he
 Consequently the actual value known as the equivalent low-pass signal or the equivalent baseband signal is the complex signal physical value representing the complex value
 modulator dwaara data sanchaarit ke liye upyogi nimnlikhit saamaanya kadam hai : The de-modulator usually performs the following on behalf of the receiver: sabhi ankiy sanchaar vyavastha main yah aam he ki modulator or di-modulator donon kaa dizin ek hi saath kiya janaa chahie
 ankiy adhimishran yojanaayen sambhav hai kyonki preshak-praapak donon pakshon ko pehle se jaankaree honi chahie ki kis tarah data kaa kutalekhan kiya jaae or sanchaar vyavastha kaa kaise pratinidhitiv kiya jaae
 sabhi ankiy sanchaar pranaaliyon main, preshak ke aaparivartak or praapak ke di-modulator donon ko is tarah banaaya jaay ki apane kaam ke alaava ek-duusare kaa bhi kaam kar saken
 In the incompatible modulation method, a receiver does not need the reference clock signal that occurs in the same phase with the sender carrier wave
 In such a case, the modulation moves asynchronously in the signal
 iskaa vipareet anukool adhimishran he
 The most common digital modulation techniques are as follows: MSK or GMSK satat charan adhimishran ke vishesh maamlen hai
 Indeed, the MSK of the subcumbus of CPM is a special case, which is also known as a symbolic-time period of continuous phase frequency-shift keying, which is a rectangular frequency pulse
 OFDM frequency divijan multiplexing par aadhaarit he, lekin iskaa upyog ek ankiy adhimishran yojana ke taur par kiya jaataa he
 The bit stream is divided into several parallel data strings and each stream is transferred to its subcarrier using the traditional digital modulation scheme
 OFDM sanket ek adhimishrit sab-carrier kaa sankshipt rup he
 OFDM is considered as a modulation technique rather than a multidimensional technique, as it transfers a bit stream to a communication channel using a sequence of so-called ofdms
 OFDM kaa vistaar chanelle acces paddati se orthogonal frequency divijan multiple acces or MC-CDMA skim se multi-eusar channel main kiya ja saktaa he, taaki bahut saare upyog kartaaon ko vibhinn sab-carrier yaa kai upyog kartaaon ko code dekar ek hi madhyam kaa upyog karne kii anumati den saken
 The two types of RF power amplifier, the switching expander, are low-cost and use less battery power than the liner amplifier with the same output power

 Differences in scientific classification with the common name of the herb may not be reflected, and some very common names may go to a different plant species group

 Many herbs have shown positive results in animal models or small-scale artificial ambient clinical investigations, but many herbal remedies have also found negative results in many studies
 The quality of tests on herbal remedies is very variable and many of the trials of herbal remedies have been found to be of poor quality, with many trials lacking comment on whether the purpose or intention of the treatment was successful
 The systemic basis or interpretation of some of the randomly conducted double-blind tests, which got the attention of medical publications, was questioned
 isi tarah, medical patrikaon main cheer-faad vaali samiksha prakashit hui, jaise vishesh tarah ke herbal jarnal kii tulana main jarnal of da american medical association ne isaki acchhee tarah se vivechna kii

 Vaidyas criticize mainstream studies on the grounds that they use inadequate amounts of historical use, which are very useful in drug discovery and development in the present and past
 unka kahana he ki chayan ke karkon jaise sarvotkrisht khuraaq, prajati or kataai ke samay or aabaadi ko lakshya banane main parampara maargdarshan kar sakati he
 Doses usually matter for herbal remedies
 While most medicines are rigorously tested to ensure efficacy and safe dosing, there are a few varieties of supplements available for various herbal remedies in the market

 Several methods of standardization of herbs can be applied

 is kaaran, kabhi-kabhi utpaadakon dwaara istemaal karne se pehle apane utpaada kii maatra kaa aankalan karne ke liye varnalekhan kii patali parat kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Another method is to standardize the excellent chemical

 One end of this is that some physicians have a long history of use of conventional treatments and do not require the level of safety testing as parasites or as a single artificially concentrated material

 The legal status of herbal ingredients varies from country to country
 EU main, herbal dawaaen ab european dierective on tradational herbal medicin products ke tahat niyantrit hota he
 In the United States, most herbal remedies are controlled by the Food and Drug Administration as supplements
 is shrenee main padanevaale utpaadon ke nirmaataaon ko unke utpaada kii suraksha or prabhavakaarita ko sabit karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he, haalanki epad kisi utpaada ko bikri se waapas le sakati he to use hanikaarak sabit kiya ja saktaa he
 The National Nutritional Foods Association, the industry's largest trade association, has been running a program to examine the status of their products and factories since 2002, giving member companies the right to display their stamp of approval stamp on their product
 UK main, US kii hi tarah herbal upachaaron ko jo bina nuskhe ke hi kiye jate he ko poorak ke rup main niyantrit kiya gaya he
 However, the herbal remedies that are prescribed and prepared after private consultation by qualified "doctor practitioners" are controlled as medicine
 ek chikitsa vaidya kuch jadi-booti ko, jo bina nuskhe ke upalalabdh nahin he or dawa adhinium ke anusuchee III ke tahat aata he; parchi main likh saktaa he
 The changes in herbal products legislation in the UK in the coming days are meant to ensure the quality of herbal products being used

 Since 2004, the sale of Ephedra as a dietary supplement is prohibited by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States and prohibited under Schedule III in the United Kingdom

 For the Urdu Kavi Sammelan see Mushaira page

 This mode of coordination of entertainment and folk education is really a confluence of literature, culture and language

 Quick comment and poetry by connecting with Peter, along with enlightening the audience, also serves as entertainment

 My Introduction — Anuradha Tripathi kavi sammelan kaa itihaas bahut purana he
 Therefore, it is not possible to know the date of commencement of poets' conferences
 parantu 1920 main pehla vrihad kavi sammelan hua tha jisamen kai kavi or shrota tha
 After that the Kavi Sammelan became an integral part of Indian culture
 aaj bharat hi nahin, varan puure vishwa main kavi sammelnon kaa aayojan bade paimaane par hota he
 In India, since independence, the early days of the 80s can be called the 'golden period' of poet conventions
 80 ke dashak ke uttarardh se 90 ke dashak ke ant tak bharat kaa yuva berojgaare jaisi kai samasyaon main ulajhaa rahaa
 It also influenced poet-conventions and the youth of India kept away from this art
 manoranjan ke nae upkaran jaise television or baad main internet ne sarkas, jaadu ke sho or naatak kii hi tarah kavi sammelnon par bhi baari prabhaav daalaa
 Kavi Sammelan both weakened in terms of numbers and quality
 shrotaaon kii sankhya main bhi baari giravat ai
 The main reason for this was that the youth surrounded by various problems did not return to the poets' conference again
 saath hi un dinon bheed main jamane vaale utkrisht kaviyon kii kami thi
 But as the new millennium began, the youth group, which spent much of its remaining time on the Internet, liked the poet convention
 internet ke madhyam se kai kavitaaon kii video us varg tak pahunchane lagi
 The youth started searching for new videos, uploading them on the Internet, downloading and sharing among themselves
 lagbhag paanch varshon ke bheetar lakhon yuva kavi sammelnon ko pasand karne lage
 This generation's strong return to poet conventions can be gauged from the fact that more than one and a half million people have seen the presentation of a poet on a website called You Tube
 2004 se le kar 2010 tak kaa kaal hindi kavi sammelan kaa doosraa svarnim kaal bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 The rapidly growing number of listeners, the arrival of quality poets and, most of all, the youth's coming back to this art confirms this
 parmparik rup se kavi sammelan saamaajik kaaryakramon, sarkari kaaryakramon, nijee kaaryakramon or gine chune corporate utsavon tak simit the
 But its increasing numbers in educational institutions in the beginning of the twenty-first century are going to affect
 jin shaikshik sansthaaon main kavi-sammelan hote hai, unamem ai ai tii, ai ai em, en ai tii, vishvavidhyalay, ejineering, medical, prabandhan or anya santhaan shaamil hai
 The above information indicates that the poet is changing the form of conventions
 hindi premi puri duniya main hindi kavi sammelan yojit karavaate hai
 No part of the world is untouched by poets' conferences today
 bharat ke baad sabase adhik kavi sammelan yojit karwaane vaale deshon main america, dubai, muscat, singapore, britain ityadi shaamil hai
 Most of these poets gatherings invite famous poets from India
 bharat main varsh bhar kavi sammelan yojit hote rahete hai
 Among the organizers of Kavi Sammelan in India are social institutions, cultural institutions, government institutions, corporate and educational institutions
 puraane samay main saamaajik santhaan sabase zyaada kavi-sammelan karavaate the, lekin is sahastrabdi ke shuruuaat se shaikshik sansthaanon ne sabase zyaada sammelan yojit kiye hai
 There has also been a tremendous change in the manner of organizing poets' conferences
 yahaan tak ki ab kavi sammelan internet par bhi book kiye jate hai
 Not many changes have been seen so far in the traditional form of Kavi Sammelan
 ek parmparik kavi sammelan main alag alag rason ke kuch kavi hote hai or ek sanchaalak hota he
 Although the total number of poets is even 20 or 30, but generally there are 7 to 12 poets in a Poet Conference
 2005 ke aas paas se kavi sammelan ke dhaanche main kuch badlaav dekhne ko mili
 Now solo poets' conferences are also held

 Its order is generally from the junior poet to the senior most poet

 According to another view, the first letter of the Himalayas, "hi" and the last letter "indu" of Indu, these two letters formed the word "hindu" and this land was called Hindusthan
 hindu shabd us samay dharm ke bajaay rashtriyata ke rup main prayukt hota tha
 Since at that time there were only people who believed in Vedic religion in India, but no other religion had emerged till then, so the word "hindu" was used for all Indians
 bharat main keval vaidic dharmavalambiyon ke basane ke kaaran kaalaantar main videshiyon ne is shabd ko dharm ke sandarbh main prayog karnaa shuru kar diya
 Generally, the word Hindu is considered by many analysts to be a term given by foreigners

 rugveda main sapt sindhu kaa ullekh miltaa he - wo bhoomi jahaan arya sabase pehle based the
 According to linguists, the "S" sound of the Hindu Aryan languages is converted to the "H" sound of the Iranian languages

 After this, the Iranians gave the name of Hindus to those living east of the Indus River
 jab arab se muslim hamalavar bharat main aae, to unhone bharat ke mul dharmavalambiyon ko hindu kahana shuru kar diya

 hindu dharm main koi ek akele siddhanton kaa samooh nahin he jise sabhi hinduon ko maananaa zaruri he

 Many beliefs and sects come under it and equal reverence is given to all
 dharmagranth bhi kai hai
 Nevertheless, the main principles, which most Hindus believe, believe in all these: religion, karma, worldly cycle of rebirth, salvation and of course, God
 hindu dharm swarg or narak ko asthaayee maanata he
 According to Hinduism, all beings in the world have a soul
 manushya hi aisa praani he jo is lok main paap or punya, dono karm bhoga saktaa he or moksh praapt kar saktaa he
 There are four main sects in Hinduism: Vaishnavism, Shaiva, Shakta and Smarta
 lekin zyaadaatar hindu swayan ko kisi bhi sampradaay main vargeekrut nahin karte hai
 In ancient times and medieval times, Shaiva, Shakta and Vaishnava used to fight among themselves
 jinhen madhyakaal ke santon ne samanvit karne kii safal koshish kii or sabhi sampradaayon ko paraspar ashrith bataaya
 In short, the main elements of Hinduism are the following: Hinduism - Hinduism - who? - Goshu Bhaktibhavedyasya Pranave ch steadha matih
 punarjanmani vishwaasah sa vai hinduriti smritah
 
 arthath-- gomata main jisaki bhakthi ho, pranav jiskaa poojya mantra ho, punarjanm main jiskaa vishwaas ho--vahi hindu he
 According to Merutantra episode 33, 'hinam Dushyati sa Hindu' means one who considers Hin to be corrupt
 lokmaanya tilak ke anusaar- asindhoh sindhuparyanta yasya bharatbhumika

 yadhyapi kuch log kai samskruti ke mishrit rup ko hi bhartiya samskruti maanate he, jabaki aisa nahin he
 The culture or religion which has not originated and developed on the land of India, how can that religion or culture be Indian
 hindu dharm ke siddhanth ke kuch mukhya bindu: According to Hindu scripture Upanishads, Brahma is the ultimate element
 wo hi jagat kaa saar he, jagat kii aatma he
 He is the basis of the world
 usee se vishwa kii utpatti hoti he or vishwa nasht hone par usee main villin ho jaataa he
 Brahm is one and only one
 wo vishwathit bhi he or vishwa ke pare bhi
 He is the ultimate truth, omnipotent and omniscient
 wo kalathit, nity or shaashvat he
 That is the ultimate knowledge
 brahm ke do rup hai : parabrahm or aparabrahm
 Parbrahma is infinite, eternal and devoid of body
 wo sabhi gunon se bhi pare he, par usamen anant satya, anant chit or anant anand he
 Brahma is not worshiped, because it is beyond worship and indescribable
 uskaa dhyaan kiya jaataa he
 Pranava is the 8 Brahmavakya, which all Hindus consider to be the ultimate holy word
 hindu yah maanate hai ki om kii dhwani puure brahmand main gunj rahi he
 It is heard when deep into meditation
 brahm kii pariklpana veydant darshan kaa kendriya stambh he or hindu dharm kii vishwa ko anupam dein he
 What is the relation between Brahma and God, the thinking of Hindu philosophy is different
 advait veydant ke anusaar jab maanav brahm ko apane man se jaanane kii koshish karata he, tab brahm ishwar ho jaataa he, kyonki maanav maaya naam kii ek jaadui shakti ke vash main rahata he
 That is, when the shadow of Brahma falls in the mirror of Maya, then the image of Brahma is shown to us as God
 ishwar apni isi jaadui shakti "maaya" se vishwa kii sristi karata he or us par shashan karata he
 Although God is with a negative force in this situation, Maya is not able to impress him, just as a magician is not surprised by his own magic
 maaya ishwar kii daasi he, parantu ham jeevon kii swamini he
 Although God is formless, but because of Maya, he can appear to us as many gods
 iske vipareet vaishnav maton or darshanon main mana jaataa he ki ishwar or brahm main koi fark nahin he--or vishnu hi ishwar hai
 According to the Nyaya, Vaishika and Yoga philosophies, God is the supreme and supreme soul, who is enlightened and is the creator and ruler of the world
 jo bhi ho, baaki baaten sabhi hindu maanate hai : ishwar ek or keval ek he
 It is both universal and reliable
 beshak, ishwar sagun he
 He is self-centered and the cause of the world
 wo puja or upasna kaa vishay he
 He is complete, eternal, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent
 wo raag-dwesh se pare he, par apane bhakton se prem karata he or unpar krupa karata he
 Without his will, not even a single leaf can move in this world
 wo vishwa kii naitik vyavastha ko kaayam rakhata he or jeevon ko unke karmon ke anusaar sukh-dukh pradaan karata he
 According to Srimad Bhagavadgita, he comes from time to time in the form of an avatar on the earth after a moral collapse in the world
 ishwar ke anya naam hai : parameshwar, paramatma, vidhaataa, bhagwaan 
 This god is called Musalman Allah, God, Christian God and Jews Yahweh
 hindu dharm main kai devtaa hai, jinako angrezi main galat rup se "gods" kaha jaataa he
 There can be three opinions about who these deities are: ek baat or kahi ja sakati he ki zyaadaatar vaishnav or shaiva darshan pehle do vichaaron ko sammilit rup se maanate hai
 For example, Krishna is considered to be the God under whom all other gods and goddesses are present and at the same time, all the gods and goddesses are considered to be the form of Krishna
 tisare mat ko dharmagranth manyata nahin dete
 Whatever be the thinking, these deities are integral to the colorful Hindu culture
 vaidic kaal ke mukhya dev the-- indra, agni, som, varun, rudra, vishnu, prajapati, savita or deviyaan-- saraswati, usha, prithvi, ityadi 
 Later Hinduism saw new goddesses - Ganesh, Rama, Krishna, Hanuman, Kartikeya, surya-chandra and planets and goddesses like - Durga, Parvati, Lakshmi, Sheetla, Sita, Kali, etc
 ye sabhi devtaa puraanon main ullikhit hai or unki kul sankhya 33 koti bataayi jaati he
 According to the Puranas, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are not ordinary gods, but Mahadev and are members of the Trimurti
 in sabake alaava hindu dharm main gaay ko bhi mata ke rup main puja jaataa he
 It is believed that the cow has a total of 33 Koti Devi gods
 hindu dharm manyataon main paanch pramukh devtaa poojaneey he
 These are different forms and powers of one God
 devataaon ke guru brihaspati maane gaye hai
 According to mythological beliefs, he was the son of Maharishi Angira
 bhagwaan shiv ke kathin tap se unhone devguru kaa pad paaya
 He protected the gods with his knowledge and mantra powers
 shiv krupa se ye guru grah ke rup main bhi poojaneey hai
 Thursday is the special day of worship of Guru Brihaspati Dev
 daanvon ke guru shukracharya maane jate hai
 His father was Maharishi Bhrigu, son of Brahmadev
 shukracharya ne hi shiv kii kathor tapasya kar mrit sanjivani vidya praapt kii, jisase vah mrit sharir main phir se praan phoonk dete the
 By the grace of Brahmadev, he is revered as the planet Venus
 shuukravaar shukr dev kii upasna kaa hi vishesh din he
 According to Hinduism, every conscious creature has an immaterial soul, which is eternal, latent, irrational and devoid of disorder
 hindu dharm ke mutabik manushya main hi nahin, balki har pashu or ped-paudhe, yani ki har jeev main aatma hoti he
 In the Bhagavad Gita, the characteristics of the soul are described by Lord Krishna as follows: kisi bhi janm main apni azaadi se kiye gayi karmon ke mutabik aatma aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 In the cycle of birth and death, the soul occupies itself as the next body without being insulted
 achche karmfal ke prabhaav se manushya kuleen ghar athwa yoni main janm le saktaa he jabaki bure karm karne par nikrusht yoni main janm lenaa padataa he
 The worldly cycle of birth and death ends only when the person gets salvation
 uske baad aatma apane vaastavik sat-chit-anand swabhaav ko sadaa ke liye paa leti he
 The human vagina is the only birth in which a person's deeds, sins and virtuous give fruit, and the attainment of salvation through action is possible
 aatma or punarjanm ke prati yahi dharanaayen buddha dharm or sikh dharm kaa bhi aadhaar he
 The sacred texts of Hinduism are divided into two parts - Shruti and Smriti
 shruti hindu dharm ke sarvocch granth hai, jo purnat: aparivartaneey hai, arthath kisi bhi yug main iname koi badlaav nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Memory texts may change according to country
 shruti ke antargat veda : rugveda, samaveda, yajurveda or atharvaveda brahm sutara va upanishad aate hai
 The Vedas are called Shruti because Hindus believe that these Vedas were recited by the divine to the sages when they were in deep meditation
 vedon ko shravan parampara ke anusaar guru dwaara shishyon ko diya jaataa tha
 Every Veda has four parts - Samhita - Mantra part, Brahmana - Granth - prose part, in which rituals are explained, Aranyak - in which other deep things are explained, Upanishads - In this, Brahma, Atma and their relation are discussed
 is
 agar shruti or smriti main koi vivaad hota he to shruti hi maanya hogi
 Except Shruti, all other Hindu scriptures are called Smriti, because they contain stories that people have memorized and written down from generation to generation
 sabhi smriti granth vedon kii prashansa karte hai
 They have a lower standard than the Vedas, but are easier to read and are read by most Hindus
 pramukh smriti granth hai:- itihaas--ramayana or mahabharat, bhagavad gita, puraana--, manusmriti, dharamshastra or dharmasutra, aagam shaastra
 There are 6 major parts of Indian philosophy - Sankhya philosophy, Yoga, justice, Vaiseshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta
 hindu dharmagranthon ke mutabik devtaa dharm ke to daanav adharm ke pratik hai
 But do you know that in mythological beliefs, the gods and goddesses are said to be the children of the same father, but different mothers
 iske mutabik dev-daanvon ke pita rishi kashyap hai
 At the same time, the name of the mother of the gods is Aditi and the name of the mother of the demons is Diti
 vishwa main adhiktam hindu jansankhya vaale 20 raashtra In ancient times the Aryans worshiped many deities with Vedic mantras and agni-yajna
 arya devataaon kii koi murti yaa mandir nahin banaate the
 The major Aryan deities were: Devaraja Indra, Agni, Soma and Varuna
 unke liye vaidic mantra padhe jate the or agni main ghi, doodh, dahi, jau, ityagi kii aahuti di jaati thi
 Prajapati Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are rarely mentioned at that time
 bharat ek vishaal desh he, lekin uski vishalata or mahanata ko ham tab tak nahin jaan sakate, jab tak ki use dekhen nahin
 This way many great men got attention, but twelve hundred years ago today, Adiguru Shankaracharya did a very important work for it
 unhonen chaaron dishaao main bharat ke chhoron par, chaar peeth sthapit uttar main badrinath ke nikat jyotipeeth, dakshin main rameshwaram ke nikat shringery peeth, purv main jagannathpuri main govardhan peeth or pashchim main dwarikapith
 There is a great devotion among our countrymen towards pilgrimages

 These four shrines are called Char Dham
 logon kii manyata he ki jo in chaaron dham kii yatra kar letaa he, uskaa jivan dhanya ho jaataa he
 Most Hindus are worshiped by idols of God
 unke liye murti ek aasaan sa saadhan he, jisamen ki ek hi niraakaar ishwar ko kisi bhi manachaahe sundar rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Hindus do not actually worship stone and iron, as some people understand
 murtiyan hinduon ke liye ishwar kii bhakthi karne ke liye ek saadhan maatr hai
 The places of worship of Hindus are called temples
 pracheen vaidic kaal main mandir nahin hote the
 The worship was then in place of fire in which a gold idol was installed as a symbol of God
 ek najariye ke mutabik buddha or jain dharmon dwaara buddha or mahavir kii murtiyon or mandiron dwaara puja karne kii vajah se hindu bhi unase prabhavit hokar mandir banane lage
 Every temple is worshiped by one or more deities

 The temples are the best symbols of ancient and medieval Indian art

 khadija ke rishtedaar khajimah ebn haakim ne khadija se kaha ki use mohammad kaa kamishan doguna karnaa hoga
 Khadija sent one of his servants, Maysarah, to assist Muhammad
 lautne par, maysarah ne bataaya ki mohammad ne bade hi pramanikta se vyavsaay kiya he jiske parinamswaroop unhe doguna laabh hua he
 Maysarah also stated that on the return journey, Muhammad sat down to rest under a tree
 tabhi vahaan se guzarate hue ek bhikshu ne maysarah ko bataaya ki, " is ped ke neeche jo baitha he yah koi or nahin he, ek nabi he

 Many wealthy Quraish men had already said yes to Khadija's marriage, but Khadija refused all
 khadija ne ek vishvasu saheli nafisa par, mohammad ko shaadi karne par vichaar poochne kaa jimmaa saunpa
 At first, Muhammad hesitated because he did not have the money to carry out the marriage
 nafisa ne poocha ki kya agar ek aurat jo vivaah ke liye sabhi saadhan jutaaye, to vah shaadi karne par vichaar karegaa
 At this muhammad-khadija agreed to join together, and after this meeting he consulted his uncle
 chachaa ne shaadi ke liye sahmati vyakt kii, or mohammad ke chachaa khadija ke liye ek aupchaarik prastaav rakhane ke liye raji hue
 It is disputed that there was only Hamza bin Abdul Muttalib or only Abu Talib, or both, who went with Muhammad on this task
