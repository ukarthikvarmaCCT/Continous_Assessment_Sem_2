 Ghasiram Kotwal is a Marathi play written by Vijay Tendulkar
 yah brahmanon ke garh puna main rojgaar kii talash main gaye ek hindi bhashi brahman ghasiram ke traasadee kii kahani he
 Humiliated by the Brahmins, Ghasiram deals with his daughter's marriage to the Maratha Peshwa Nana Phadnabis and seeks revenge on the Brahmins by acquiring Poona's Kotwali
 kintu naanaa uski beti kii hatya kar detaa he
 Ghasiram cannot take revenge even after wanting it
 ulte naanaa uski hatya karvaa detaa he
 The original Marathi form of the play was first performed on 16 December 1972 in Poona by the Progressive Dramatic Association at the Bharat Natya Mandir
 nirdeshak the dow jabbaar patel
 'ghasiram Kotwal' is not a historical drama
 vah ek naatak he, sirf naatak !naatak sirf naatak hi hota he
 To say in the context of a literary work that it is historical, or mythological, or social, is meaningless
 samay bahut jaldi saamaajik ko aitihaasik or aitihaasik ko puranic bana detaa he
 Yet the content of this play — raw masala — is chronologically chronologically
 itihaas kaa ksheen-sa aadhaar avashya liya gaya he
 However, the drama has nothing to do with history beyond this
 or yah kaccha masala bhi thik usee tarah itihaas se liya gaya he, jis tarah samasamyik jivan-sthitiyon se bhi liya jaataa he
 Maharashtra was ruled by the Peshwas, Nana Phadnavis was the head of the Peshwa, one was a Ghasiram, a Brahmin, a Maratha chieftain, and all those units in their respective circles, like a wooden stick in the flow of time, sometimes moved away, sometimes
 Sometimes touching each other, sometimes colliding, the untimely flow was flowing
 unka yah kaary-karan uchit tha yaa anuchit yaa unka moolbhoot astitv sarthakatayukta tha athwa nahin, isaki khojbin karnaa itihaas kaa shodh karanevaale vyakti kaa kaam ho saktaa he, naatakkaar kaa nahin
 For this reason, i consider 'ghasiram Kotwal' as an historical drama
 ‘ghasiram kotwaal’ ek kinvadanti, ek janashruti ek dantakatha he
 And the legend has its own structure: when we rekindle our reality with the help of imagination, it becomes a legend
 dantakatha gapp bhi he or dekhne kii drushti ho to ek daahak anubhav bhi
 There is no doubt in this that only the creative experience becomes creative literature
 parantu dantakatha kya hoti he or kisi hoti he, isse zyada mahatva kii baat yah he ki ham use kis tarah lete hai, kyonki tabhi ham apni jaanch-padtaal karte hai
 Obviously this is the most difficult task, that is a deep challenge
 use swikaarna apni sahitya-nishtha kaa parichay dena he
 In my view, 'ghasiram Kotwal' indicates a specific social situation
 vah samaaj-sthiti na puraani he or na nai
 Neither is it tied to any geographical boundary, nor from time itself
 vah sthal-kalathit he, isliye ‘ghasiram’ or ‘naanaa fadanvis’ bhi sthal-kalathit hai
 Societies give birth to them, they will continue to give
 kisi bhi yug kaa naatakkaar unase achoota nahin rah paaegaa
 According to his nature, he will sometimes give a grand and gruesome look to the stage, sometimes he will make a dance-musical and present it
 maine jaan-boojhkar duusari reeti apanaai he
 The flexibility of folklore is noted and most useful for the presentation of the legend
 usamen ek paatr vishisht manovriti kaa pratinidhi banakar ubharta he or vah manovriti ekadam pratyaksh tathaa paripurna or amishrit hoti he
 In spite of the superficiality, she remains equally exposed to the general audience
 iske atirikt uskaa apana ek bhadesapan bhi hota he jo bhashaa or tamaasha ke staron par swayamev avateern hota he
 Why would i leave out this peculiarity of Loknatya? lekin rachanaakaar ko apni rachana ke vishay main zyada nahin bolnaa chahie, rachana swayan bolti he or vahi satya he
 Vijay Tendulkar is naatak main ghasiram or naanaa fadanvis kaa vyakti-sangharsh pramukh hote hue bhi tendulkar ne is sangharsh ke saath-saath apni vishisht style main tatkaaleen saamaajik evam rajnatik sthiti kaa maarmik chithran kiya he
 As a result, the difference of time-settlement on the entire state of the ruling class and the general public does not make much difference
 ghasiram har kaal or samaaj main hote hai or har us kaal or us samaaj main use vaisaa banaanevaale or banaakar mauka taak uski hatya karanevaale naanaa fadanvis bhi hote hi hai-vah baat tendulkar ne apane dhang se pratipaadit kii he
 Nana has used Ghasiram very cunningly
 par jab unka rachaa ‘rakshas’ palatakar unheen ko chunauti dene lagata he to naanaa hi use nasht bhi kar detaa he
 From this point of view, this drama is of Nana Fadnavis, no doubt
 ghasiram ek prakaar se ek prasang maatr he jise tendulkar ne apane vaktavy kii abhivyakti kaa ek nimitt, ek saadhan banaaya he
 The portrayal of Nana Fadnavis and the then decadent society in the drama 'ghasiram Kotwal' has to reveal some truth to Tendulkar about the political and special social conditions which have become eternal
 itihaas ke naanaa fadanvis bauddhik prakharata se tadapati hui shakti ke rup main pratishthit hai
 But in this drama, only Ghasiram Kotwal is surrounded by the limits of his personality, his personality is seen as one, his other dimensions are not revealed
 apratyaksh rup se tendulkar ne iskaa bhi usee tarah upyog kiya he jaisaa lok naatakon main hota he jahaan charitra aamtaur par ek yaa do ayamavaale hi hote hai
 That is why a famous Marathi critic has described the play as being very traditional Indian drama-form epithet
 maine apni prastuti main isi baat ko kendriya sutara ke rup main mana he
 While watching the play, it should be unconsciously descending in the minds of the audience that the whole society is collapsing, it is getting lost
 yah baat apratyaksh nahin honi chahie
 As the composition of this play was completely new to Marathi theater, i was very happy to express its intended meaning in the desired indirect way
 kisi pratishthit naatakkaar ne lokanaty ke swaroop main koi naatak pehle dhaala nahin tha, isliye main lokanataka ke lacheele lochapurna shilpatantra kaa upyog kai prakaar se khulkar kar sakaa
 The imagery of the men’s swinging curtains is wonderful for the theater
 is naatak kii sabase badi yukti bhi yahi he
 Twelve Brahmins handle the narrative as a chorus
 aavashyaktaanusaar taatkaalik ikhari bhoomikaaye bhi nibhaate hai
 This curtain divides into two sections and in a moment, is transformed into many components of society, units
 ghasiram ko kotwaal ke rup main sthapit karanevaala yahi paradaa ghasiram ke vadh ke samay rusht brahmanon ke rup main rangamanch par dikhta he
 The same screen which is sung by Shri Gajraj Nartan, connects his relationship with Lokanatya through ganapati-vandana
 kalakaar or bhoomika ke bich ek sookshm or tar sambandh lokanaty kii visheshta he
 i did not tie my performance to any particular folk style but have mixed use of pure Marathi folk arts like Dashavatar, Bharuad, Khela, Tamasha, Powada, Wadhyamurali, Kirtan etc
 saraswati, lakshmi, ganpati dwaara dashavathari armbh hota he
 i have tried to show the equanimity in these different styles by using the Thal of Aarti of this time only for black vaccines during Kirtan
 brahman-veshdhari kalakaar prekshagrih se hokar rangamanch par aate hai
 In this way, the folklore form of performance becomes more and more communicated to the mental level of the audience due to the intimacy arising
 naatak ke pehle ank kii gati duusare ank kii apeksha dhimi he
 It is only natural to take time to establish a historical person in the external form of folk theater because it is an entirely new experience
 naanaa fadanvis sareekhe itihaas-purush kaa rangamanch par nrity-talbaddh hokar aana marathi darshak ke liye nishchay hi dhakka pahunchaanevaala anubhav tha
 Therefore, the viewer had to be convinced that the character of this play, Nana Phadnavis, is merely a folk character - not the authentic, complete personality of the historical plays
 kuch samikshakon kii drushti main yah baat bahut dhime-dhime sthapit hui
 But i felt that the direction of Ghansiram's use of Nana to get the place of Nana in it and to get the cotwali in it by directing the hollow society, etc
 should have been very detailed
 duusare ank kii gati tej thi
 Ghasiram, the oppressor of Poona's Brahmins, his vengeance, the transformation of Ghasiram into a demon due to that vengeance, etc
 is established by going to the scene of fire test
 naanaa ke vivaah se lekar gauri kii mrityu tak ghasiram bahut baichaiyn he lekin uski bechaini naradham kii he
 He did not want to slay the Brahmins in the cell, but the murder of Naradham Ghasiram is the result of his indirect crime - this contradiction of destiny has been effectively depicted by Tendulkar
 niyati kaa aisa pratishodh anek aitihaasik khalnaayakon ke prasang main miltaa he
 After Ghasiram's assassination, Nana's clever speech is full of levity and diplomacy, producing a unique impression of his dominance and Nana Fadnavis is again at the center of the play
 is naatak kaa angrej paatr ek darshak maatr he
 At the end of the play, he is standing in the lighthouse to the left at the rear post
 neeche ghasiram kii hatya ke baad samuhik utsav ho rahaa he
 This is the premonition of upcoming history of Poona
 yahi angrej ghasiram ke kotwali praapt karne ke samaaroh ke samay bhi ek kone main khadaa hokar uskaa sakshi banataa he
 When i first read this play, it seemed that the play is not visual-oriented, but rather visual-oriented
 mujhe aise hi drishy-bimbon dwaara prabhaav utpann karanevaale naatak kii talash thi
 Secondly, it was in my mind for a long time that the special effect that is produced in the films from three to four distances of distant intermediate and proximal pictures and the craft and tact of their blending should not be on theater as well? This drama proceeds from the sum of many segments like dialogue, dance, music, motion, characters, scenes etc
 in sabko jodanevaala sutara bhi jabardast he
 With all these elements, the play seems to be 'complete', so i tried to make it come true with the imaginary camera in hand
 prakaash-yojana dwaara rangamanch ko vibhajit kar dur or paas ke anek vaanchit prabhaav rangamanch par utpann kiye
 i set the pace and grouping etc
 in paper preparation only
 meri paddati main naatak kii pradarshan-prati ke har prishth par prasang ke rekhachitr pehle se taiyaar rahete hai
 Sixty-sixty-five characters of this drama did not automatically vibrate, but they were fully prepared for this
 in paatro kii gati-style kathputliyon kii tarah apekshit thi
 Ghasiram, which i chose in terms of character, was small in stature
 aasapaas ke ‘prachand’ vyaktiyon main vah bouna hi laganaa bhi chahie tha
 The dance movements were simple and easy but rhythmic
 shastreey nrity kaa prayog is lokanaty main jatil or atiprishkrut laga
 It was necessary to have the unrestrained energy of folk dance in the dance movements
 ghasiram kii nritymay mrityu-maatr ko hi swat: sfoort dhang se prastut kiya gaya
 The strong rhythm of the drum and the drum was further enhanced by Chandavarkarji 1, which increased the intensity of the scene
 naanaa kii nrity-gatiyon main sanyam or prabhutaa kaa put barkaraar tha
 Mulagandji 2 had molded Lavani into a sitting of Lavani, who was a full-fledged Marathi Rangwali

 Only the sundari instrument was an exception there
 naanaa-gauri ke baag ke drishy main or naanaa ke vivaah ke samay sundari alag-alag dhang se bajaai gayi thi
 Chandavarkar ji did not want the organ because the effect of popular music plays would have come in folk music
 naman, laavni, powada, vaadhyamurali, bharud aadi apane prakrut angadh oj ke saath hi gaae gaye
 Chanting was used for the first time on Marathi theater by Chandavarkar
 manushyon ke hilte parade kii gunagunaahat dwaara bhinn-bhinn bhavaveg vyakt kiye gaye
 After Ghasiram's murder, there is celebration and then the curtain of human beings comes to the fore
 katha samaapt ho chuki he, isliye naanaa kii bhoomika karanevaala abhinayta bhi is parade main sammilit ho jaataa he
 Ghasiram is lying dead, but the actor does not get upset due to the rise, so he is allowed to remain in the same place as an exception
 tabhi sutaradhar aage badhkar shri gajraj nartan karain dhrupad ko bhairavi ke karun swar main gaakar us ‘kalakaar’ ko shrridhanjali arpit karata he
 In a way, the complete craft of Loknataka is seen here and the arrival of a ruling person like Nana in the row also signifies special meaning, because as mentioned earlier, the British standing behind is watching all this
 magar lokanaty shilp se bhi adhik naatak kaa yah rup adhik gahare sochane ko vivash karata he
 Ghasiram speaks directly to the audience, to deepen the effect which is contrary to Brecht, because here Ghasiram does not obstruct the narrative, nor does he seek to erase the effect
 yaheen rudh lokanaty se bhinn shilp kaa prayog tendulkar ne kiya he
 Historical authenticity was not urged in costumes, this also influenced the folk style
 rangon kaa chunaav avashya saavdhaanee se kiya gaya jisase samoohan aadi main rang-mishran kii sambhaavna rahe
 The exercise was carried out every day for three-and-a-half months

 It was only through a collaborative effort of a passionate, artist, dance-director, music-director and director that a different performance could be performed

 There is a predominance of devotion in it
 iske do prasang "krishna kii bal-lila' or "bhramar-geetsar' atyadhik mahatvapurn hai
 There are said to be about one lakh posts in Sursagar
 kintu vartmaan sanskarnon main lagbhag paanch hajaar pad hi milte hai
 More than a hundred copies of it have been received at various places, which date from the period 1658 to the nineteenth century, the oldest of them being found safe in the Saraswati store at Nathdwara
 darshanik vichaaron kii drushti se "bhagwat' or "sursagar' main paryaapt antar he
 Dr
 Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, while appreciating Sursagar has written - puraa hastlikhit rup main "sursagar" ke do rup milte hai - "sangrahatmak" or sanskrit bhagwat anusaar "dwadash skandhaatmak"
 Two forms of collective "sursagar" are also seen
 pehla, aapke-gaughat par shrivalbhacharya ke shishy hone par pratham pratham rache gaye bhagavallilatmak pad- "braj bhayu maihair ken put, jab yai baat suni" se prarambh hota he, doosraa-"mathura-janm-lila" se
 


 It is said that there is a separate history of origins development of Ojhal "sursagar" from the Hindi literary history texts, which have not come to light till now and the contemporary devotees of Shri Sur are the creators of the history- "shri Gokulnathji, Srihariraji ji and Shri Nabhadas ji Prabhriti Which is specifically mentioned in at: in purva par ke anek mahatvapurn granthon se janaa jaataa he ki shri sur ne sahasravadhi pad kiye, lakshavadhi pad rache, koi granth nahin rachaa
 Later called anant-sur-padavali Sagar

 They were supposed to compose, so they used to bless themselves by filling the color of fine rasas in the ragas sung from morning to evening
 astu, na unamem apni unmukt kritiyon ko sangrah karne kaa bhav tha or na kai kram dene kii umang
 His task was to sing his Lord's maternal grandfather, Gunuli Garuli Gunavali, to be immersed in his amritopam rasa and to be meticulously different in the pastimes from Baal to Poond state in the Nandalaya of "etechansha Kalpuns: Krishnastu Bhagwan Himself", here all his free compositions Where was the time and place to collect and sort
 kaha jaataa he, shri surdaas "ekadam andhe the," tab apni jab tab kii samast rachanaaon ko kaise ekatra karte? phir bhi surdaas dwaara nity rache or gaaye jane vaale padon kaa lekhan or sankalan avashya hota rahaa hoga
 Otherwise, they would have occupied the original composed and sung verse
 sambhavat: sur ke samakaleen shishy yaa mitra-yadi sur sachmooch andhe the to-un padon ko likhte or sankalit karte rahe honge
 So far, no history of his collection or davadas being combative is fully known

 According to the sect, "no service without kirtans and no kirtan without service", so wherever these funds went, there were also the works of poets of Ashthachap in the form of "kantha" or "granth" and in the form of their compiled- It is also called "nitya Kirtan" and "salotsav"
 sur ke sagar kaa "sangrahatmak" rup shrisur ke sammukh hi sankalit ho chukaa tha
 Its no a written copy of 1630 AD is found in Braj

 On their basis, it can be said that this "dwadash punitive form according to Srimad Bhagwat" of Surya Samudit Sagar was not made before the eighteenth century
 uskaa purvakthith "sangrahatmak" rup is samay tak kaaphi prasar paa chukaa tha
 Also, there was no significant difference between the beauty, the simplicity of this form, and the purity and beauty of the language
 vah sur ke samay jaisi vividh raagamayi thi waisi hi sundar bani rahi, kintu iske is dwadash skandhaatmak roopon main vah baat samuchit rup se nahin rah saki

 Under the influence of extremely strong electric field, the electrons are separated from the gaseous atoms and immediately run towards the material with strong velocity
 tej palaayan ke kram main ve gas ke udasin parmaanuon se takaraate hai or unke ek ek electron ko bhi mukt kar dete hai
 In this way, the electrons that are liberated also run like their liberating electrons with great velocity towards the material, and the flow of these creates cathode rays

 Over a period of time, the knowledge of the emission of alpha rays from radioactive materials was realized and it was found that these rays also attract towards the minuscule
 at: ye bhi canal kirnon kii hi sadrush gunsampann prathit hui
 Hence canal rays and alpha rays were kept in the same class and the rays of this class were called 'dhan Kiran'

 As a result, due to the establishment of foreclosure and civil courts, new revenue policy, policing, development of means of swapping, etc
, the self-reliant life and local autonomy of the villages gradually ended
 parantu aage chalakar angrejon ne bhi yah anubhav kiya ki unki kendrikaran kii niti se shashanbhaar din prati din badhata hi ja rahaa he
 On the other hand, the demand for autonomous governance was also increasing due to national awakening
