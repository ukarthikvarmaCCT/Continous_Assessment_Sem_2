 Over time, as Europe became Christianized and Latin language became a religious language, these languages adopted the Roman script and the use of Rooney scripts decreased
 scandinavia main istemaal hone vaali runi lipiyon ko fuzark kaha jaataa tha kyonki inke pehle chah aksharon kii dhvaniyaan 'fa', 'u', 'ji', 'a', 'r' or 'k' thim
 In this, pay attention to the sound of 'th' as it is slightly different from 'th' without any point

 Members in this list form this forum with members of the East Asia Summit: vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The history of Hinduism is very ancient
 is dharm ko vedakaal se bhi purv kaa mana jaataa he, kyonki vaidic kaal or vedon kii rachana kaa kaal alag-alag mana jaataa he
 The oral tradition continued here for centuries, through which its history and texts continued to move forward
 uske baad ise lipibaddh karne kaa kaal bhi bahut lanbaa rahaa he
 Vedas are the most sacred texts of Hinduism
 vedon kii rachana kisi ek kaal main nahin hui
 Scholars started the creation of Vedas in 2000 BC
 It is assumed from yani yah dhire-dhire rache gaye or antat: pehle veda ko teen bhaagon main sankalit kiya gaya- rugveda, yajurveda or samaveda jise vedatrayee kaha jaataa tha
 It is believed that the split of the Vedas took place during the time of Pururava Rishi before Rama's birth
 baad main atharvaveda kaa sankalan rishi atharva dwaara kiya gaya
 At the same time, according to another belief, during the time of Krishna, Ved Vyas composed and scripted the Vedas

 According to religious literature, there are some other concepts of Hinduism
 ramayana, mahabharat or puraanon main surya or chandravanshi raajaaon kii vansh parampara kaa ullekh uplabdh he
 Apart from this, there is a description of the origin and tradition of many dynasties
 ukt sabhi ko itihaas sammat krambaddh likhnaa bahut hi kathin kaary he, kyonki puraanon main ukt itihaas ko alag-alag tarah se vyakt kiya gaya he jiske kaaran iske sutron main bikharaav or bhram nirmit jaan padataa he, phir bhi dharm ke gyaataaon ke liye yah bhram nahin he
 In fact, Hindus kept their history alive by singing, rote and based on sources
 yahi kaaran rahaa ki vah itihaas dhire-dhire kavyamay or shringaarik hota gaya jise aadhunik log itihaas maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 It was a time when there was no paper and pen
 itihaas likhaa jaataa tha shilaon par, pattharon par or man par
 Before reading the history texts of Hinduism, there is a reference to the tradition of Manus before the tradition of sages and sages, who have been called Kulkars in Jainism
 aise kramash: 14 manu maane gaye hai jinhone samaaj ko sabhy or takneekee sampann banane ke liye athak prayaas kiye
 The name of the first man of the earth was Swayambhu Manu and the first woman was Satarupa, in the Mahabharata, eight manu are mentioned
 is vakt dharti par aathven manu vaiwaswath kii hi santaanen hai
 Eighth Manu was the Matsya avatar of Lord Vishnu at the time of Vaivaswat
 puraanon main hindu itihaas kaa aarambh sristi utpatti se hi mana jaataa he
 To say that this started from here may not be appropriate, yet there is a mention in Hindu history texts Mahabharata and Puranas from Manu to the generation of Lord Krishna
 hindu dharm lagbhag 5000 saal se vyavasthit viksit hua he or saat charnon ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he ki doorabeen ek-duusare main he
 Some Hindutva advocates would believe that Hinduism was revealed to the sages in its entirety by the end of the Ice Age 12,000 years ago
 hindutv ke itihaas main, puranic kathaayen sirf samay-samay par itihaas he, itihaaskaar gananaa nahin kar sakate yaa nahin
 In recent times, Hinduism has been described as an "open source religion", unique in that it has no defined founder or doctrine, and its ideas constantly evolve in response to historical and geographical realities
 yah kai sahaayak nadiyon or shakhaon ke saath ek nadi ke rup main sabase acha varnit he, hindutv shakhaon main se ek he, or vartmaan main bahut shaktishaalee he, kai log swayan ko nadi ke rup main maanate hai
 About 5000 years ago, in the Bronze Age, now called the Harappan Indus Valley Civilization, which is characteristic of brick cities, reached the vast area of the Indus river valley over the Ganges for nearly a thousand years
 samtal in shaharon main, ham un chitron ke saath mitti kii javaanon ko khojate hai jo vartmaan hindu prakruti kii bahut adhik hissaa hai jaise pipel vriksh, bail, swastika, saat daasi, or ek aadmi jo yoga mudra main baitha he
 We do not know much about this stage because language remains to be understood
 3,500 saal pehle, louh yug main, vaidic bhajanon or anushthanon se pataa chalaa ja saktaa he jisamen hadappa ke vichaaron ke nishaan hote hai, lekin ek sthai shahari jivan style kii bajaay ek khanaabadosh or gramin jivan style ke liye dizin kiya gaya he
 Some Hindutva advocates completely disagree and insist that the two stages are actually one
 is charan main, hamen ek vishvadrushti milti he jo bhautik duniya kaa jashn manaati he, jahaan ishwaron ko anushthanon ke saath pesh kiya jaataa he, or swasthya or dhan, samruddhi or shanti pradaan karne ko kaha jaataa he
 This aspect of inviting the gods and receiving favor from them continues to this day, although these rituals vary
 vedon ne sindhu se apper ganga or nichle ganga maidaanon main ek kramik failaav prakat kiya he
 Some Hindutva scholars refute such geographical spread and insist on the subcontinent to have advanced, such as fully developed, homogenous, urban Vedic culture, plastic surgery and even airplanes since ancient times
 tisare charan main 2,500 saal pehle upanishad ke rup main janaa jaataa granthon ke saath, jahaan anushthanon kii tulana main aatmanirikshan or dhyaan par adhik mahatv diya gaya tha, or ham punarjanm, mathvaad, janm or mrityu ke chakra se mukti jaise vichaaron par adhik dhyaan kendrit karte hai
 This phase saw the rise of shamanic traditions such as Buddhism and Jainism, its followers spoke in Pali and Prakrit and also rejected the Vedic form and the Vedic language, Sanskrit
 isamen brahman pujaariyon ne bhi dharm-shastron kii rachana ke madhyam se vaidic vichaaron ko punargathit kiya, kitaaben jo ki shaadi ke madhyam se saamaajik jivan ko viniyamit karne or paarit hone ke anushthan par dhyaan kendrit karti hai, or logon ke dayitvon ko unke purvajon, unki jati or vishwa par nirbhar karata he
 vast
 kai shikshavid vaidic vichaaron ke is sanghathan kaa varnan karne ke liye brahmanwad kaa prayog karte hai or ise ek mul rup se pitrusattatmak or magasivadi bal ke rup main dekhte hai jo samtawadi or shantivaadee mathon ke adeshon ke saath hinsak rup se pratispardhaa karte hai
 Buddhism and Jainism, along with Vedic practices and beliefs, spread from North India to South India, and eventually from the subcontinent to Central Asia and to Southeast Asia
 dakshin main, tamil sangam samskruti kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha, us jaankaree ke bare main jo praarambhik kavitaaon ke sangrah se aate hai, jo vaidic anushthanon ke kuch gyaan or buddha dharm or jain dharm ke gyaan ke saath baad main mahakavyon kaa pataa chalata he
 Some Hindutva scholars say that there was no separate Tamil Sangam culture
 yah puri tarah se viksit, samroop, shahari vaidic samskruti kaa hissaa tha, jahaan sabhi ne sanskrit ko bolaa tha
 The fourth phase saw the rise of writings such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the Purana, which began 2,000 years ago, where stories are used to reconcile the worldview of domestic and world relations and create the now familiar Hindu worldview

 These rocks were formed by sediments deposited by the river in low-lying sites of an earlier large southern peninsula, or in divergent basins that were probably submerged
 gondvanaa kaal main mukhyat: mrittika, shelashila, balua pathar, kankerla mishrapindashm, sakonashm ityadi shilaon kaa nickshepan hua
 Being built in clean water, these rocks lack abundance of clean aquatic and terrestrial organisms and fossils of flora and fossils of oceanic organisms and flora

 Some scholars are of the opinion that this region was not a large plot, but was a group of many landmasses which were related to each other by narrow settlers or landmarks

 These two land blocks have been called 'pangea'

 It is known from the study of the geographical conditions of this period that initially, ie, in the last Carbon Age, the climate of Gondwana region was glacial which is confirmed by the presence of the Boulder folds of this era which are found on all the underlying parts
 bharat kii talcheer, dakshini africa kii dwaika, dakshini-purvi austrailia kii muri tathaa dakshini america kii rio tubaaro samudaayon kii shilaayein inhen boulder tahon par sthit hai

 Buddhism was founded by Gautama Buddha in the 6th century BCE

 In the next five centuries of his Mahaparinirvana, Buddhism spread throughout the Indian subcontinent and in the next two thousand years also spread across the central, eastern and southeastern Jambu continent
 buddha dharm main chaar pramukh sampradaay hai: hinayan, therwaad, mahayan, vajrayan or navyan, parantu buddha dharm ek hi he evam sabhi buddha sampradaay buddha ke siddhanth hi maanate he
 Buddhism is the second largest religion in the world after Christianity, nearly 2 billion people in the world are followers of Buddhism

 Pew Research has reported a very small number of Buddhists from China, Japan and Vietnam, although these countries are the top three countries with the highest Buddhist population
 duniya ke 200 se adhik deshon main buddha anuyaayi hai
 But Buddhism is a 'major religion' religion in a total of 18 countries including China, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Mongolia, Tibet, Laos, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, Singapore, South Korea and North Korea
 bharat, nepal, america, australia, indonesia, rus, bruneii, malaysia aadi deshon main bhi lakhon or karodon buddha anuyaayi hai
 Buddha's real name was Siddhartha
 unka janm kapilwastu ke paas lumbini main hua tha
 In this place, Emperor Ashoka built a pillar in the memory of Buddha in the third century BC
 siddharth ke pita shaakyon ke raja shuddhodan the
 According to the traditional tale, Siddhartha's mother Mahamaya died some time after his birth
 kaha jaataa he ki unka naam rakhane ke liye 8 rishiyo ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha, sabhi ne 2 sambhaavnaayen bataai thi, ve ek mahaan raja banenge ve ek sadhu yaa parivrajak banenge
 Hearing this speech, King Shuddhodana tried hard not to allow Siddhartha to become a monk to the extent of his ability
 shaakyon kaa apana ek sangh tha
 At the age of twenty, every Shakya Tarun had to be initiated into Shakya Sangha and become a member of the Sangh
 siddharth gautam jab bees varsh ke huye to unhone bhi shakyasang kii sadsyta grahan kii or shakyasang ke niyamanusaar siddharth ko shakyasang kaa sadsy bane huye aath varsh vyateet ho chuke the
 He was a very devoted and firm member of the Sangh
 sangh ke maamalon main ve bahut ruchi rakhte the
 His conduct as a member of the Sangh was an example and he made himself dear to everyone
 sangh kii sadsyta ke aathven varsh main ek aisi ghatana ghati jo shuddhodan ke parivaar ke liye dukhad ban gayi or siddharth ke jivan main sankatpurna sthiti paidaa ho gayi
 Adjacent to the kingdom of the Shakyas was the kingdom of the Kolis
 rohni nadi donon rajyon kii vibhaajak rekha thi
 Both Shakya and Koli used to irrigate their fields with the waters of the Rohini River
 har fasal par unka aapas main vivaad hota tha ki koun rohinee ke jal kaa pehle or kitna upyog karegaa
 These disputes sometimes turned into fights and battles
 jab siddharth 28 varsh ke the, rohni ke pani ko lekar shakya or coliyon ke naukaron main jhagada hua jisamen donon ore ke log ghayal huye
 On finding out the quarrel, Shakyas and Kolis thought that why should this dispute be resolved by war forever
 shaakyon ke senapati ne coliyon ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke prashn par vichaar karne ke liye shakyasang kaa ek adhiveshan bulaayaa or sangh ke samaksh yuddh kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Siddharth Gautam opposed this proposal and said that war does not solve any question, war will not serve any purpose, it will lead to the planting of another war
 siddharth ne kaha meraa prastaav he ki ham apane main se do aadmi chune or coliyon se bhi do aadmi chunane ko kahen
 Then these four together choose a fifth man
 ye paanchon aadmi milakar jhagade kaa samaadhaan karen
 Siddharth's proposal was invalidated by a majority, and Shakya Senapati's proposal for war was passed by an overwhelming majority
 shakyasang or shakya senapati se vivaad na sulajhane par antatah siddharth ke paas teen vikalp aaye
 Among the three options, he had to choose one option, joining the army, participating in war, agreeing to social boycott of his family and the confiscation of his fields, hanging or accepting expulsion
 unhone teesraa vikalp chunaa or parivrajak banakar desh chhodane ke liye raji ho gaye
 Siddhartha first started finding answers to his questions with the five Brahmins by becoming a Parivrajaka
 ve uchit dhyaan hasil kar paae, parantu unhen apane prashnon ke uttar nahin mili
 Then he tried to do penance
 ve is kaary main bhi ve apane guruon se bhi zyaada, nipun nikle, parantu unhe apane prashnon ke uttar fir bhi nahin mili
 Then he gathered some companions and went on to do more rigorous penance
 aise karte karte chah varsh baad, bina apane prashnon ke uttar paaen, bhukh ke kaaran mrityu ke kareeb se guzare, ve fir kuch or karne ke bare main sochane lage
 At this time, he remembered a moment of his childhood, when his father was starting to prepare the farm
 us samay ve ek anand bhare dhyaan main pad gayi the or unhe aisa mahasoos hua tha ki samay sthir ho gaya he
 Leaving hard austerities, he found an asexual path, which is also called the middle path, because this path is in the midst of both the austerities and the greatness of incontinence
 apane badan main kuch shakti daalane ke liye, unhone ek bakrii-vaale se kuch doodh le liya
 He sat under a peepal tree, promising that he would not rise without knowing the truth
 35 kii umr par, unhone bodhi pai or ve buddha ban gayi
 His first sermon was in Sarnath near Varanasi
 apane baaki ke 45 varsh ke liye, gautam buddha ne ganga nadi ke aas-paas apana dharmopadesh diya, dhanwaan or kangaal logon dono ko
 He also founded a union of two ascetics who continued to spread the sermon of the Buddha
 tripitak buddha dharm kaa mukhya granth he
 It is written in Palibhasha
 yah granth buddha ke parinirvana ke pashchaat buddha ke dwaara diya gaya upadeshau ko sutarabaddh karne kaa sabase vrihad prayaas he
 The sermon of Buddha is presented as a sutra in this book
 sutron ko varg main baandha gaya he
 The wag is included in the body or in the section
 nikaayon ko pitak main ekikrut kiya gaya he
 In this way three Pitakas are formed whose combination is called tri-pitaka
 palibhasha kaa tripitak theravaadi buddha parampara main srilanka, thailand, burma, laos, cambodia, bharat aadi raashtra ke buddha dharm anuyaayi paalna karte he
 Pali's Tipitaka is also translated into Sanskrit, which is called Tripitaka
 sanskrit kaa purna tripitak abhi anuplabdh he
 Presently the surviving tradition of Sanskrit Tripitaka Purpose is available only in the Newar caste of Nepal
 is ke alaava tibet, china, mongolia, japan, korea, vietnam, malaysia, rus aadi desh main sanskrit mul mantra ke saath main sthaneey bhashaa main buddha sahitya parampara paalna karte he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 tathagat buddha ne apane anuyaayion ko chaar aryasaty, ashtangik maarg, das parmita, panchasheel aadi shikshaaon ko pradaan kiye hai
 The first sermon of the Tathagata Buddha, which he had given to some of his sages, was about these four Aryan truths
 buddha ne chaar arya satya bataaye hai
 There is sorrow in this world
 janm main, boode hone main, beemaari main, maut main, priyatam se dur hone main, naapsand chizon ke saath main, chahat ko na paane main, sab main dukh he
 Trishna, or desire, is the cause of sorrow and continues the world with renewed vigor
 trishna se mukti pai ja sakati he
 Salvation from craving can be attained by living according to the ascendant path
 saanchaa:main:ashtangik maarg According to Buddhism, the Arya Ashtanga Path of the Fourth Arya Truth is the way to stop suffering
 gautam buddha kehete the ki chaar arya satya kii satyata kaa nishchay karne ke liye is maarg kaa anusaran karnaa chahie : 1
 Right view: Believing in the Four Noble Truths 2
 Right resolutions: Promising mental and moral development 3
 Right speech: Do not speak harmful things and lie 4
 Right actions: Do not do harmful actions 5
 Right life: Any Do not even directly or indirectly do harmful business 6
 Right efforts: Trying to improve oneself 7
 Right memory: Trying to get mental ability to see with clear knowledge 8
 Yk tombstone: Achieve Nirvana and loss of self kuch log arya ashtaang maarg ko path kii tarah samajhate he, jisamen aage badhane ke liye, pichley ke str ko paanaa aavashyak he
 And people feel that the levels of this passage are found all together
 maarg ko teen hisson main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he : pragna, sheel or samadhi
 Lord Buddha has taught his followers to follow the five Shilohs
 pali main – panatipaata vermani sikkhapadam sammaadiami ! Meaning - i take the instruction to be free from animal violence
 paali main – adinnadana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to keep away from theft
 paali main – kamesoomichhachara vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to desist from adultery
 paali nen – musavada vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to refrain from lying
 paali main – surameray majjapamadthatana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami
 Meaning - i take the education of drinking liquor, raw liquor and abstaining from intoxicants
 gautam buddha se pai gai gyaanata ko bodhi kehalaate he
 It is believed that only after getting Bodhi can be rid of the world
 sari parmitaaon kii nishpatti, chaar arya satyon kii puri samaj or karm ke nirodh se hi bodhi pai ja sakati he
 At this time, greed, guilt, fascination, avidya, craving and belief in the soul all disappear
 bodhi ke teen str hote he shravakbodhi, pratyekbodhi or samyaksambodhi
 Samyakasambodhi is considered the most advanced ideal of Buddhism
 gautam buddha ke mahaparinirvana ke baad, buddha dharm ke alag-alag sampradaay upasthit ho gayi hai, parantu in sab ke bahut se siddhant milte hai
 All Buddhist sects follow the basic principles of the Tathagata Buddha
 prathithyasamutpaada kaa siddhant kahata he ki koi bhi ghatana keval duusari ghatnaon ke kaaran hi ek jatil kaaran-parinaam ke jaal main vidyaman hoti he
 For beings, it means the cycle of infinite worlds according to karma and vipak
 kyonki sab kuch anitya or anaatman hota he, kuch bhi sach main vidyaman nahin he
 Every event is basically zero
 parantu, maanav, jinke paas gyaan kii shakti he, trishna ko, jo dukh kaa kaaran he, tyagkar, trishna main nasht kii hui shakti ko gyaan or dhyaan main badalakar, nirvana paa sakate hai
 Everything in this world is transitory and mortal
 kuch bhi sthaayee nahin
 But there is opposition from Vedic faith
 aatma kaa arth 'mai' hota he
 However, beings are made of body and mind, which do not have stability
 kshan-kshan badlaav hota he
 Therefore, there is no permanent thing called 'I' meaning soul
 jise log aatma samajhate hai, wo chetana kaa avichhinn pravaah he
 The mind has replaced the soul
 buddha ne brahm-jaal suta main sristi kaa nirmaan kaisaa hua, ye bataaya he
 The creation is created and destroyed again and again
 ishwar yaa mahabrahma sristi kaa nirmaan nahi karte kyonki duniya prathithyasamutpaada arthath kaarykaran-bhav ke niyam par chalati he
 According to Lord Buddha, karma is responsible for the grief and happiness of humans, not God or Mahabrahma
 par anya jagah buddha ne sarvocch satya ko avarnaneey kaha he
 Nothingness is the predominant philosophy of the Mahayana Buddhist sect
 vah apane hi sampradaay ke logon ko mahatv dete hai
 Buddhism does not mean pessimism
 dukh kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he, lekin saapekshavaad or yatharthwaad he
 Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are the three triratnas of Buddhism
 bhikshu, bhikshuni, upsakaa or upsika sangh ke chaar avyav hai
 The full observance of the ten parameters is called the Bodhisattva
 bodhisattva jab das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kar lete hai tab "buddha" kehalaate hai
 Becoming a Buddha is the culmination of a Bodhisattva's life
 is pahchaan ko bodhi naam diya gaya he
 Buddha Shakyamuni is said to have only one Buddha - there were many before him and there will be more in the future
 unka kahana tha ki koi bhi buddha ban saktaa he agar vah das parmitaaon kaa purna paalan karte hue bodhisattva praapt kare or bodhisattva ke baad das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kare
 The ultimate goal of Buddhism is the end of suffering from the entire human society
 "main keval ek hi padaarth sikhaata hoon - dukh he, dukh kaa kaaran he, dukh kaa nirodh he, or dukh ke nirodh kaa maarg he" 
 Followers of Buddhism walk on the asexual path and live according to it and try to get rid of ignorance and sorrow and attain nirvana
 buddha dharm main sangh kaa bada sthaan he
 In this religion Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are called 'triratna'
 sangh ke niyam ke bare main gautam buddha ne kaha tha ki chote niyam bhikshugan parivartan kar sakate he
 After their Mahaparinirvan, there was a huge increase in the size of the Sangh
 is vruddhi ke pashchaat vibhinn kshetra, samskruti, saamaajik avasthaa, diksha, aadi ke aadhaar par bhinn log buddha dharm se aabaddh hue or sangh kaa niyam dhire-dhire parivartan hone laga
 At the same time, in the Kalam Sutta of Angushava Nikaya, Buddha has given freedom to practice religion on the basis of his experience

 This article is about Yashodhara, the work of Maithilisharan Gupta
 gautam buddha kii patni yashodhara ke liye rajkumaari yashodhara dekhen
 Maithili Sharan is a famous poem written by Gupta which was published in 1933 AD
 apane chote bhai siyaaramsharan gupt ke anurodh karne par maithilisharan gupt ne yah pustak likhi thi
 This epic is written in the Yashodhara epic keeping the story of Gautama Buddha's home sacrifice at the center
 isamen gautam buddha kii patni yashodhara kii virahajanya pidaa ko vishesh rup se mahatva diya gaya he
 This prose-verse is a mixed genre called Champukavya
 yashodhara kaa uddeshy he pati-parityakton yashodhara ke hardik du:kha kii vyanjana tathaa vaishnav siddhanton kii sthapana
 Amazed by the aura of Amitabh, the devotees were first interviewed by the pain of the invisible Yashodhara, the immortal singer of human relations, Maithilisharan Gupta, the founder of human-friendly sympathy
 saath hi 'yashodhara' ke madhyam se sanyas par grihasth pradhan vaishnav dharm kii gaurav pratishtha kii he
 == Storyline = Katharambha comes from the disinterested contemplation of Gautama
 jaraa, rog, mrityu aadi ke drishyon se ve bhaybheet ho uthte hai
 To search for the nectar element, Gautama leaves his wife and son asleep and performs 'mahabhinishkramana'
 yashodhara kaa niravadhi virah atyant kaarunik he
 More than the virility of Virh he eats the beloved "to steal
" isar samajhati he parantu use maran kaa bhi adhikaar nahin he, kyonki us par rahul ke paalan-poshan kaa daayitv he
 As a result, she lives by "milk in anchal" and "water in eyes"
 siddhi praapt hone par buddha lautate hai, sab log unka swaagat karte hai parantu maanini yashodhara apane kaksh main rahati hai
 Finally God himself reaches her door and begs
 yashodhara unhen apni amuly nidhi rahul ko de detii he tathaa swayan bhi unka anusaran karti he
 The first half and history of this story is famous but the latter is the creation of the poet's own prolific imagination
 'yashodhara' kaa pramukh ras shringaar he, shringaar main bhi keval vipralambh
 There is a coincidence of coincidence
 shringaar ke atirikt isamen karun, shant evam vatsalya bhi yathasthaan uplabdh hai
 The poetry presented presents an impression of shadowy craft
 ukti ko adbhut kaushal se chamatkrit evam saprabhav banaaya gaya he
 The language of Yashodhara is pure Khadiboli - its softness and masculinity are the special qualities of maturity, creativity and lyricism, thus Yashodhara proves to be an excellent creation
 keval shilp kii drushti se to vah 'saket' se bhi sundar he
 Even from the point of view of poetry, 'yashodhara' is indicative of Gupta's management skills
 yah prabandh-kavy he- lekin samakhyanatmak nahin
 It is theatrical because of the poet's focus on characterization, and there is a predominance of lyricism in the characterization of a dignified woman
 at: 'yashodhara' ko pragitatmakataa natya prabandh kahana chahie, jo ek sarvatha paramparamukt kavy rup he
 Yashodhara's viraha is extremely darun and the reason for being perceived as an obstacle to the path of siddhi seems to hurt his self-respect
 parantu vah naritv ko kisi bhi ansh main hin maanane ko prastut nahin he
 She is the Indian wife, her half-hearted expression is outspoken - "I will have something in it that you will get
 " sab milakar yashodhara adarsh patni, shreshth mata or aatmgaurav sampann nari he
 But Gupta has protected Gautama's traditional sublime character as soon as possible
 yadhyapi kavi ne unke vishwaason evam siddhanton ko amaanya tehraaya he tathaapi unke chirprasiddh rup kii raksha ke liye ant main 'yashodhara' or 'rahul' ko unka anugami bana diya he
 Rahul is of paramount importance in the composition and development of the object in the poetry presented
 yadi rahul sa laal god main na hota to kadaachit yashodhara maran kaa hi varan kar leti or tab is 'yashodhara' kaa pranayan hi kyon hota
 Rahul's mentality is mentioned in 'yashodhara' poetry
 uski balsulabh cheshtaaon main adbhut aakarshan he
 Over time, his intellect also develops, which is evident from his utterances
 parantu yah sab ekadam swaabhaavik nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In some cases, Rahul talks tactfully, like Prudo, which is certainly exaggerated even in the context of a born child
 yashodhara ek charitra pradhan kavy he
 The purpose of the creation of this book is to highlight the character of Upekshita Yashodhara
 kavy ke namakaran se hi siddh ho jaataa he ki yashodhara hi is kavy kii pramukh paatr he
 Gupta intended to compose this poem with the purpose of interpreting his saga
 in panktiyon se is baat kaa gyaat ho jaataa he- The poet has also thrown more light on the Virahini form of Yashodhara
 virahinee gopa raat-din ansu bahaati he
 He realizes that he is born only to cry
 us ablaa jivan kii aankhon main sadaiv pani bharaa rahata he or isiilie vah apane pati ko nayan-nir hi detii he
 Crying in front of Rahul hurts Rahul, that is why he is full of heart and cry after he falls asleep
 is prakaar vah rote-rote raat katati he
 Sleep has gone away from his eyes forever
 gautam buddha ke chale jane par yashodhara apane purvarag ko samaran karti hui kahati he-- In a state of frenzy, Yashodhara cuts off her edgy beautiful hair by saying 'go with my head hair' and grabs Rahul with his arms so loud that he suffocates
 vastav main, viyog kaa dukh jab agrahya ho jaataa he-- "main uth dhaaun
 "she calls her Vanmali- that too soon because she fears that the 'birds of the eyes' might fly away before they come, but Gopa immediately realizes that the affection is made to burn and this body
 Everything is made to endure
 yashodhara ke ansu itane moolyawaan he ki shuddhodhan unhen lekar 'mukti mukta' tak chhodne ko taiyaar he
 Virahini fasts on Yashodhara, wears torn and worn clothes
 is prakaar rajbhog se vanchit yashodhara keval gautam kii chintaa main ji rahi he
 'don't know how many rains have passed' but the days of Gopa did not stop
 vah ooshmaa-si thandi saansen bharti dukh se sukh kaa mulya aankati he
 He is confident that his playing days will be cut and the playing days will come and then he will be able to see the Lord one day
 isiilie vah kabhi-kabhi apane nayan ko vyarth vyakul hone se manaa karti he kyonki use aisa lagata he ki is rone main bhi kuch nahin rakhaa he
 As Anuragini, Yashodhara's character has grown
 uske charitra kii visheshta yah he ki vah anuraagini hote hue bhi maanini he
 She respects her husband as much as she loves him
 vastav main vah mira kii bhanti apane pati-parameshwar kii upasika he
 Maan, darp, upalambha etc
 have been given important place in Vaishnava-bhakti
 yashodhara kaa bhi kathan he-- Yashodhara's mother's form is also more pronounced than her submissive form
 pati se viyukt nari kaa ekmaatr sambal uskaa putr hota he
 Yashodhara's' Malin Goddi ki Lal ',' The body of her body ',' The eyes of Anjan ',' Opposition of oppressions', 'jeeva-naiya ka khiwaiya', 'dukhini's happiness',' Her brother ',' Her king 'everything is Rahul
 yadi gautam ne uske is avlamb ko bhi chhin liya he to vah bhi shri govindvallabh pant ke naatak 'varmala' kii nayika vaishalini kii tarah dar-dar jangalon kii khaak chaanati phirti
 Apart from this, she would not have received the sensation and sympathy of her mother-in-law, she would have been in the cheek of the times
 yashodhara is liye jiti he ki rahul kaa bhaar uske upar he tathaa saas-sasur kii sahanubhuti uske saath he
 In Yashodhara poetry, just as Yashodhara's mother's form has flourished, so too her human form
 jab bhagwaan buddha gyaan praapt karke magadh aae tab shuddhodhan or mahaprajavati yashodhara ko bahutera samajhaate hai ki use apane pati ke darshan ke liye prastut hona chahie
 But she does not offer for this
 vah samajhati he ki usne apane pati kaa saath nahin chhoda he
 Her husband hid from her and left the house
 atah unhen hi uske paas aana chahie
 When her mother-in-law-in-law urges her to go to Magadha, Manini Yashodhara comes in a trance and faints
 jab gautam buddha kapilwastu main padhaarte hai tab maanini ab vahi baithi he jahaan par uske priyatam use chhodkar gaye hai
 She explains that when they are favored, they will come and call themselves and place them at their feet
 hota bhi yahi he
 Gautama Buddha himself has to come to the door of his Manini and say - kavita kosh par maithilisharan gupt rachit "yashodhara" Kaikhusro Dadabhai Sethna a prominent disciple of Sri Aurobindo
 inkaa doosraa naam amal kiran he
