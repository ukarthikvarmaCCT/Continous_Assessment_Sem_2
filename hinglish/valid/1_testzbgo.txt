 ye log gondi bhashaa kii maadiya upbhasha bolte hai
 This tribe dwelling in the uncultivated forests of Abujhmad has preserved its original tradition and culture till date
 maadiya janajati ko mukhyatah do upjatiyon main baanta gaya he - abujh maadiya or baisan horn maadiya
 Abuzh Madia resides in the hilly areas of Abuzhmad and the Baisan Horn Madia in the plains forests bordering the Indravati River
 baisan horn maadiya ko is naam se isiliye pukaara jaataa he, kyonki ve ghotul main or khaas avasaron main naachne ke dauraan baisan yani kii gaur ke singo kaa mukut pahante he
 Their transferred agriculture is called Jhoom
 dono upjatiyo kii samskruti kaafii had tak milti julati he
 Both of them do not like to meet outsiders, but Abuja Madiya is more aggressive in both, he does not miss to attack with arrows when outsiders come to his area
 jabaki baisan horn maadiya bahari logon ke aane par zyaadaatar jangalo main bhaag janaa pasand karte he
 Madiya people are very fond of boozy liquor and masmutia
 'masamutiyaa' chhattisgarh kaa sthaneey shabd he jiskaa matlab bachche kii tarah jaldi naaraaz hona or fir turant use bhul janaa hota he
 Madiya worships the total deity named Kakasar
 acchhee fasal ke liye ye apane devtaa ke sammaan main shandaar nruty karte he
 Their magnificence in music and dance is worth seeing
 ye behad kushal shikari hote he or inke paas gajab kaa saahas hota he
 When attacked, these tigers do not hesitate to take iron from wild buffalo or bear
 ye baagh kaa behad sammaan karte he or anaavashyak kabhi baagh kaa shikaar nahin karte
 If someone goes to their area with the intention of hunting a tiger, the madis do not leave it alive
 maadiya log vachan dene par use nibhaane ke liye tatpar rahete hai
 The Madiya people follow the Ghotul tradition in which all the unmarried boys and girls of the village go to the Ghatul house of the village in the evening
 ghetul main ek sirdaar hota he or ek kotwar yah dono hi pad aam taur par bade kuwanren ladakon ko diya jaataa he
 Sirdar is the head of Ghatul and Kotwar helps him to handle the arrangements there
 sabase pehle saare ladke ghetul main pravesh karte hai uske baad ladkiyaan pravesh karti hai
 Kotwar divides all girls into different boys
 koi bhi joda do yaa teen dino se upar ek saath nahin rahata
 After this, the girls decorate the hair of the boys and massage the hands and freshen them up
 uske baad sabhi ghotul ke baahar naachte hai
 Married women cannot participate in the dance, but married men can take part
 aam taur par ve vaadya bajaate hai
 Every boy in the dance has one hand on the shoulder of a girl and the other on the waist
 yah aag ke charge ore gheraa bana kar naachte hai
 The dance intensifies over time
 nrity ke samay gaaye jane vaale ek geet ke bol kuch is tarah ke hai- As is evident from this song, in the Madiya tribe, the girl has to pay the price for the marriage, in case of not paying the price, the boy has to work for some time at the girl's father, this period is from three to seven years
 Can
 aise vivaah ke tay hone par seva ke pratham varsh jode ko shaareerik sambadh banane kii chhot nahin hoti he, kintu yadi ladki kii sahmati ho to uske baad yah bandhan hat jaataa he
 Marriage is the biggest expense of life among the Madiya people
 vivaah karne ke liye ladki kii keemat dono paksh baith kar tay karte hai
 And the groom has to pay this price

 In Ghotul, young men of old age teach physical education to young men of young age
 yahan par vivaah kii aapasi sahamati ban jane par yuvak yuvatiyon ko shaadi karne ke liye parivaar waalon ko bataanaa hota he
 They often run away to the forest if they are not convinced
 lekin aisi shaadi main bhi keemat to chukaani hi padati he
 Girls do not sleep at night in Abujhmadia Ghotul, but boys stay in Ghotul at night
 lekin bison horn maadiya main ve raat ghotul main hi bitaate he
 Madia women do not sleep with their husbands on the cot and when a man older than age is at home, she does not sit on the cot
 yadi maadiya ko baagh uthaakar le jaay to ve use divine prakope samajhate hai
 This is especially linked to the illicit relationship of the wife
 yadi baagh kam samay main usee maadiya ke duusare jaanavar ko bhi le jaay to vah apni patni par kadi najar rakhana shuru kar detaa he
 Immoral relationships are not tolerated at all in Madiya society
 lekin yadi mahila apane pati se khush naa ho to vah bina kisi virodh ke doosraa pati chun sakati he, basharte vah vyakti pehle ko patni ke upar kharch kii gayi vivaah kii keemat chukaa de
 Polygamy is also allowed in the Madia caste, but it rarely happens due to the huge expenses incurred in marriage
 iname vidhwaa vivaah kii bhi ijaajat he
 After death in the Madia tribe, burial is usually done in the grave, but in some cases the corpse is also burnt

 State Code: 09 District Code: 135 Tehsil Code: 00720 angl vidhi ke sandarbh main suvidhadhikaar kaa arth he - 'ek vyakti kaa duusare kii bhoomi par adhikaar'
 The word 'privilege' appears to be of French or Norman origin
 suvidhadhikaar sambhavat: utana hi pracheen he jitna sampatti kaa adhikaar he
 Its first definition is given in a book called 'termes de Laley'
 hindu or muslim donon kanoonon kii pustakon main suvidhadhikaron kii charchaa milti he parantu british bharat ke nyaayalay inako lagu nahin karte the haalaanki aise vyaktigat kanoonon ko ve lagu kar sakate the jo nyaay, samya or svachh ant:karan ke viruddh nahin the yaa jo roodhi athwa pratha kaa rup dhaaran kar chuke the
 Given the different situation of India, the rules of English law also could not be applied here
 isliye bharat main, shuru-shuru main hi, is vishay par samhitakrit kanoon kii aavashyaktaa anubhav kii gai
 In 1882, the Indian Rights Act was passed
 yah kanoon mukhyat: hwitale stokes ke masaude par aadhaarit tha
 Initially this law was implemented only in Madras, Coorg and Central Provinces but from time to time it was implemented in other areas
 suvidhadhikaar vidheyak paas hone se purv suvidhadhikaar sambandhi kanoon indian limitesan act 1877, main shaamil tha
 The Indian Privileges Bill defines this right as: jis bhoomi ke laabhakaari upyog ke liye yah adhikaar diya jaataa he use suvidhadhikari bhoomi kehete hai -us bhoomi ke swami athwa adhibhokta ko suvidhadhikari swami kehete hai
 The land on which this obligation applies is called the land of the facility and its owner or the owner is the owner of the facility
 'k' naamak ek makaan-maalik ko 'kha' kii bhoomi par jaakar vahaan se apane istemaal ke liye ek sote se pani lene kaa adhikaar he- yah suvidhadhikaar kehalaayegaa
 The privilege can be positive or negative - it can be continuous or intermittent
 suvidhabhaarit bhoomi par kuch karne kaa adhikaar karte rahane kaa adhikaar sakaaratmak suvidhadhikaar he-is par kuch karne se rokane kaa adhikaar athwa roke rahane kaa adhikaar nakaaratmak suvidhadhikaar he
 Constant privilege is one whose consumption or continuous consumption happens without human being doing something like the right to get light
 saviram suvidhadhikaar vah he jiske upyog ke liye manushya kaa sakriy sahyog anivaary he, jaise guzarane ke liye raste kaa upyog
 The jurisdiction can be direct or indirect
 pratyaksh suvidhadhikaar vah he jisamen iske astitv kaa koi dikhaai dene vaala sthaayee chinh ho
 If there is no such visible sign, the privilege will be indirect
 suvidhadhikaar sthaayee ho saktaa he athwa niyatkaalik athwa niyatkaalik badhayukta
 The privilege can only be for a particular place or for a specific time or for a particular purpose
 suvidhadhikaar kii prapti abhivyakt athwa dhvanit anudaan se ho sakati he yaa lambey arse tak iske upyog se ho sakati he; chirbhog se ho sakati he athwa iske roodhi ban jane se ho sakati he
 Where the jurisdiction is necessary, the law accepts a voided jurisdiction, such as the result of exchange or division of a building if it is divided into two or more separate parts and one of these parts is in such a condition that when Till no privilege is given to other parts, till then it cannot be properly utilized, then the law will accept this privilege and it will be Say Iseshadikar
 chirbhog dwaara visheshadhikaar kii sweekruti ke liye yah anivaary he ki pichley bees varsh se bagaiyr kisi baadha ke is adhikaar kaa upyog kiya gaya ho
 If a right has been consumed as a result of the agreement between the facilitator and the facilitator, then it does not get the perpetual privilege
 aisi baadha se jise suvidhadhikari ne ek varsh tak maun sweekruti na di ho yaa aisi baadha se jise suvidhadhikari or suvidhabhaarit ke bich hue samjhaute main sweekaar kiya gaya ho, upbhog kii nirantarata par koi prabhaav nahin padataa or is tarah chirbhog dwaara suvidhadhikaar kii prapti main koi rukaawat nahin padati
 In order to gain the right through conservatism, it is necessary that the stereotype is ancient, consistent and rational
 uskaa nirantar shantipurvak or khuleam upbhog hota rahaa ho
 Except for the privileges arising out of conservative privileges or express grants, the Indian Rights Bill has certain common duties and rights laid down for the rest of the privileges and facility-owned owners, such as the privilege should be exercised by the authority in a manner which is less than that for the convenience-charged owners
 Be less dependent than; If there is any damage to the property, etc
, as a result of the act of consumption of the privilege, the privileges should be replenished as far as possible
 vidheyak ke antargat suvidhadhikari swami se yah adhikaar chin liya gaya he ki vah suvidhadhikari ke raste main daali gai anuchit baadhaon kaa swayan shaman kar de
 Termination of privilege can be on the release or surrender or expiry of the stipulated period
 iske atirikt isse sanlagn samaapti avasthaa ke utpann ho jane par bhi isaki samaapti ho sakati he
 The termination of a requirement entitlement may be terminated by the requirement for which this privilege was granted
 suvidhadhikari sampatti ke laabhakaari upyog ke liye hi suvidhadhikaar diya jaataa he, isliye suvidhabhaarit swami ko ise chaalu rakhane kii maang karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 English law recognizes rights in the occupation class
 bhartiya kanoon main aisa nahin he
 Habitat rights are those associated with participating in the benefits of neighboring lands, such as the right to pasture or the right to hunt or catch fish
 kram-vikaas kisi jaivik aabaadi ke anuvanshik lakshanon ke pidiyon ke saath parivartan ko kehete hai
 Observable traits change due to genetic changes in biological populations
 jaise-jaise genetic vividhta pidiyon ke saath badalati he, prakritik varan se wo lakshan zyada saamaanya ho jate hai jo uttarjivan or prajnan main zyada safalataa pradaan karte hai
 The age of the Earth is about 4

 Evolution does not seek to explain the origin of life
 par kram-vikaas yah samajhaata he ki pracheen saral jivan se aaj kaa jatil jivan kaise viksit hua he
 Seeing the similarities between all the castes of today, it can be said that all the creatures of the earth have a common ancestor
 ise antim saarvjaanik purvaj kehete hai
 All the castes of today have arisen from this through the process of evolution
 sabhi shakson ke paas jeens ke rup main anuvaanshik padaarth hota he
 All the individuals take it from their parents and give it to their children
 santanon ke jeens main thodi bhinnata hoti he
 This is due to mutation and alteration of existing genes during sexual reproduction
 iske kaaran santane mata-pita or ek duusare se thodi bhinn hoti hai
 If those variations are useful, then the chances of survival and reproduction of the offspring are high
 iske kaaran agali peedi ke vibhinn shakhson ke jivit rahane or prajnan karne kii sambhaavna samaan nahin hoti he
 As a result, the traits that make organisms more adapted to their conditions, become more common in the next generations
 ye bhinnataayen dhire-dhire badhati rahati hai
 This process is responsible for the diversity of organisms seen today
 adhikansh genetic utparivartan shakson ko na koi sahaayta pradaan karte hai, na unki dikhaawat ko badalte hai or na hi unhen koi haani pahunchaate hai
 Through genetic drift, these unbiased genetic mutations are only incidentally established in populations and survive for generations
 iske vipareet, prakritik varan ek yadrichhik prakriya nahin he kyonki yah un lakshanon ko bachaati he jo jivit rahane or prajnan karne ke liye jaruri hai
 Natural selection and genetic drift are regular and dynamic parts of life
 arabon varshon main in prakriyaaon ne jivan ke vansh vriksh kii shakhaon kii rachana kii he
 The modern thinking of evolution began with the emergence of the book Charles Darwin's Biology, published in 1859
 iske saath grager mendal dwaara padpon par kiye gaye adhyayan ne anuvaanshiki ko samajhane main madad kii
 The discovery of fossils, advances in population genetics and the global network of scientific research have provided more detailed information on the mechanism of evolution
 vaigyanikon ko ab nayi jatiyon ke udgam kii zyada samaj he or unhone ab prajatikaran kii prakriya kaa avlokan prayogshaala or prakruti main kar liya he
 Evolution is the basic scientific principle that biologists use to understand life
 yah kai vishyon main prayog hota he jaise ayurvigyaan, maanas shaastra, jaev sangrakshan, maanavshaastra, forensik vigyaan, krishi or anya saamaajik-saanskrithik vishay
 The main ideas of evolution are summarized as follows: 19 veen shatabdi main prakritik itihaas ke sangrahalay kaafii lokapriy the
 During this time European explorations and naval expeditions carried the natural scientists and collectors of large museums together
 charles darwin ek graduate the jo prakritik itihaas vigyaan ke vishay main shikshit or prashikshit the
 Natural historians like him used to collect specimens for museums, catalog them, describe and study them
 darwin echemes beagal naamak jahaaj par prakritik vaigyanik kaa kaam kar rahe the
 He was assigned a five-year research trip around the world
 apni yatraaon ke dauraan unhone bahut se jeevon ke namoonay ekatrit kiye or unka nirikshan kiya
 He was particularly interested in the diverse fauna of the coasts of South America and the nearby Galápagos Islands
 darwin ko dur-dur ke sthanon se namoonay ekatrit karne or unka adhyayan karne se vyapak anubhav praapt hua
 From these studies he introduced the idea that every caste evolved from ancestors with similar traits
 1938 main unhone samajhaayaa ki yah ek prakritik prakriya se kaise ho saktaa he
 He named this natural process natural selection
 kisi aabaadi kaa aakaar uske parivesh main maujuud sansadhano kii maatra par nirbhar karata he
 For the population to remain stable for years, it is necessary to balance the population size and available resources
 parivesh jitani santanon ko aashray de saktaa he, us se adhik paidaa hoti hai
 Due to this, not all persons of any generation can survive
 isliye uttarjivan ke liye jaruri sansadhano ke liye hameshaa ek pratyogi sangharsh bana rahata he
 This made Darwin realize that survival does not depend on mere coincidence
 unhen ehsaas hua ki uttarjivan shakson kii bhinnataaon, yaa "lakshanon", par nirbhar karata he
 Some traits aid the survival of individuals and some hinder it
 parivesh ke zyada anukulit shaks apane kam anukulit pratidwandviyon kii tulana main agali peedi ko zyada santaanen dete hai
 Characteristics that hinder survival and reproduction disappear after a few generations
 jo lakshan uttarjivan or prajnan main sahaayta karte hai wo peedi dar peedi jamaa hote rahete hai
 In this way, due to the unequal ability of the person's survival and reproduction, the population changes gradually
 praaniyon or padpon main bhinnataaon ke avlokan prakritik varan ke siddhant kii buniyaad bane
 Darwin observed that orchids and insects have a special partnership that helps in pollination of plants
 unhone dekha ki orchidon main aisi bahut sari sanrachanaayen hoti hai jo kiton ko aakarshith karti hai, taaki pushpon kaa paraag unke sharir main chipak jaae
 In this way the kits carry pollen from a male orchid to a female orchid
 orchidon kii jatil dikhaawat ke baavjood, ye visheshikrut bhaag unheen moolbhoot sanrachanaon se banate hai jinase anya pushp banate hai
 In his book Fertilization of Orchids, Darwin proposes that orchid flowers are more adapted to the environment by the process of natural selection from the existing floral parts
 darwin abhi apane vichaaron par anusandhan or prayog kar hi the ki unhen alfred rasal vailes se ek chitthee mili
 In this letter, Wallace described a theory similar to Darwin's theory
 iske kaaran donon ne in siddhanton kaa sanyukt prakaashan kiya
 Wallace and Darwin both looked at the history of life as a family tree, with the tip of the branch representing today's castes and a common ancestor rather than the branching of the branches
 darwin ne kaha ki jivit chizein rishtedaar hai
 This meant that the whole life originated from a few simple ancestors
 or yah bhi sambhaavna thi ki sabhi jeevon kaa ek hi purvaj ho
 Darwin published his theory of evolution by natural selection in 1859 in his book The Emergence of Animals
 unke siddhant kaa matlab he ki maanav samet sabhi jeev aviraam prakritik prakriyaaon kii upaj hai
 Due to this some religious groups have raised objection to the theory of evolution
 iske vipareet vaigyanik samudaay main 99 pratishat se zyada log is siddhant kaa samarthan karte hai
 Natural selection is often synonymous with survival of the fittest, but this expression originates from Herbert Spencer's book Biology Theory, published in 1864, five years after Darwin's book
 swasthitam kii uttarjivita prakritik varan kii prakriya ko galat dhang se samajhaati he kyonki prakritik varan keval uttarjivan ke bare main nahin he or hameshaa swasthitam hi nahin jivit rahata he
 Darwin's theory of natural selection laid the foundation for the modern theory of evolution
 unke anusandhanon or avlokanon ne dikhaaya ki ek aabaadi ke shaks ek duusare se bhinn hote hai, in bhinnataaon main se kuch bhinnataayen mata-pita se milti hai or prakritik varan in bhinnataaon ko chunata or tyaagta he
 But they could not give a reason for these differences
 apane se pehle ke jeev vaigyanikon kii tarah ve samajhate rahe ki anuvaanshik lakshan upyog yaa anupyog kaa kaaran the, or apane jivan kaal main grahan kiye gaye lakshan apane bacchon ko die ja sakate hai
 He tried to find examples of this
 unhone sochaa ki shuturamurg jaise bade udaan rahit pakshiyon kii taangen zyada chalane ke kaaran peedi dar padhi shaktishaalee hoti rahi hongi, or unke pankh kam udne ke kaaran peedi dar peedi kamazor hote rahe honge
 This misconception was called the "heredity of acquired traits", which was part of the theory "change of castes" proposed by Jean Baptiste Lamarck in 1809
 19 veen shatabdi ke ant main yah siddhant ko lamarkwaad kehalaata tha
 Darwin proposed an unsuccessful theory called pangenesis to explain the heredity of traits acquired over a lifetime
 1880 ke dashak main august visman ke prayogon ne dikhaaya ki apane jivan kaal main grahan kiye gaye lakshan bacchon ko nahin die ja sakate hai
 Due to this, Lamarckism was abandoned in some time
 nae lakshan mata-pita dwaara santanon ko kaise die jate hai, iskaa uttar anuvanshiki par grager mendal ke agrani kaary se mila
 His experiments conducted over several generations of pea plants proved that genetic information is split at the time of formation of sex cells in the mother and father and that information from the mother and father is added at random during fertilization
 isaki tulana taash ke patton se kii ja sakati he jahaan kisi jeev ko aadhe pattey mata se yadrichhik dhang se milte hai or baaki aadhe pita se yadrichhik dhang se
 Mendel called this information factors, but later the name Jean became more prevalent
 jin anuvanshiki kii mul ikai he
 They contain information that directs the physical development and behavior of the organism
 jin diene se banate hai
 DNA is a long molecule made up of small molecules called nucleotides
 anuvaanshik jaankaree diene main newcliotidon kii shrunkhlaa ke rup main sangrahit hoti he
 DNA can be compared to an article in which nucleotides act as characters
 jis prakaar varnon kii shrunkhlaa se ek bana lekh jaankaree ko sangrahit karata he, usee prakaar newcliotidon kii shrunkhlaa se bana diene anuvaanshik jaankaree ko sangrahit karata he
 Genes are instructions made from the letters of the alphabet of DNA
 sabhi jin milakar ek "nirdesh pustika" ke jaise hote hai jisamen ek jeev ko banane or kaam karaane kii sari jaankaree hoti he
 Changing these instructions written in DNA due to mutation increases the genetic variation of the population
 diene keshikaon ke andar chromosomon main hota he
 a random mixture of chromosomes from parents at fertilization gives the offspring a unique combination of genes
 langik janan ke dauraan jeenon kaa yah yadrichhik mishran bhi aabaadi kii genetic bhinnata ko badhata he
 Genetic variation of a population also increases with breeding with another population
 is kaaran aabaadi main wo jin aa sakate hai jo usamen pehle se maujuud nahin the
 Sequence is not a random process
 haalanki diene main utparivartan yadrichhik dhang se hota he, par prakritik varan yadrichhik prakriya nahin he, uttarjivan or prajnan kii sambhaavna parivesh par nirbhar karti he
 The evolution is the result of natural selection over billions of years of flawed copying
 kram-vikaas kaa parinaam bakubi rachaa gaya jeev nahin hota he
 The result of natural selection is adapted organisms of their existing environment
 kram-vikaas kisi param lakshya kii taraf pragati nahin he
 Evolution does not attempt to create more developed, more intelligent or more complex organisms
 udhaaharan ke liye, pissu bichchhu makkhi kehalaae jane vaale ek pankhons vaale jeev ke vanshaj hai, or ajagaron main abhi bhi nanhee sanrachanaayen hoti hai jo unke purvajon ke pichley pairon ke avshesh hai
 Rapid changes in the environment usually lead to extinction of the maximum castes
 prithvi par rahi 99 pratishat se adhik jatiyaan vilupt ho chuki hai
 Five major mass extinctions have occurred since the beginning of life on Earth
 inke kaaran jatiyon kii vividhta main badi or aakasmik giravat hui he
 The most recent of these is the cretaceous-paleogene extinction event, which took place 6
6 million years ago
 genetic drift ek jati kii aabaadiyon main eleelon kii aavruti ke badalane ko kehete hai
 a allele is a variation of a gene
 ye baalo kaa rang, twachaa kaa rang, ankhon kaa rang, rakt prakaar aadi nirdhaarit karte hai
 Genetic drift does not introduce new alleles into the population, but it can reduce genetic diversity by removing any alleles from the population
 genetic drift eleelon ke yadrichhik chayan se hoti he
 Selection is truly random when no external force influences it
 udhaaharan ke liye, samaan maap or bhaar par bhinn rangon ke kanchon se bhare ek apaardarshee thile se kuch kanche nikaalnaa ek yadrichhik chayan he
 Whether or not a person will be able to give their alleles to their children depends on their survival in which coincidence also plays a role
 sanyog ke kaaran aabaadi main alilon kii aavruti ke badalane kii is prakriya ko genetic drift kehete hai
 Genetic drift has a greater impact on small populations than on larger populations
 hardi-venberg niyam kahata he ki hardi-venberg samyavastha main hone vaali ek badi aabaadi main pidiyon ke saath eleelon kii aavruti nahin badalegi
 But it is impossible for a population of sufficient size to reach this system because these five things are necessary to reach this system
 1) aabaadi kaa aakaar anant hona chahie
 2) The mutation rate should be zero percent, because mutation can change alleles or create new alleles
 3) aabaadi se yaa main pravrajan nahin hona chahie, kyonki aabaadi main aane vaale yaa aabaadi ko chhodane vaale shaks eleelon kii aavruti ko badal sakate hai
 4) There should be no selective pressure on the population, that is, the probability of survival or reproduction of a person should not be more than others
 5) samagam puri tarah se yadrichhik hona chahie, jahaan sabhi nar baraabar aakarshak saathi hon
 This ensures truly random adulteration of alleles
 hardi-venberg samyavastha main aabaadi taash ke patton ke ek deck ke anuroop he; deck ko chaahe jitani baar phenta jaae, usamen na koi nayaa patta aayega or na koi patta nikalegaa
 The alleles in the population here have been compared to deck leaves
 aabaadi bottlenake paryaavaran kii ghatnaon ke kaaran kisi jati kii aabaadi ke teji se kam ho jane ko kehete hai
 a truly random population bottlenac does not favor any allele; That is, it is random which person will survive
 ek bottlenake aabaadi kii genetic vividhta ko kam yaa khatm kar saktaa he
 The subsequent genetic drift may further reduce the genetic diversity of the population
 genetic vividhta kii kami aabaadi ko anya chaynaatmak dabaavon ke jokhim main daal sakati he
 An example of a population bottleneck is the "northern Elephant Seaway"
 19 veen ke atyaadhik shikaar ke kaaran uttari eliphant jalavyaghron kii aabaadi tees shakson se kam ho gai thi
 Due to conservation, the population of these has crossed one lakh and is increasing continuously
 par aabaadi bottlenake ke prabhaav saafe dikhaai dete hai
 In the absence of genetic diversity in the population, these aquifers are at great risk from diseases and are very likely to have genetic disorders
 sansthaapak kaa prabhaav tab hota he jab aabaadi kii ek choti toli baaki aabaadi se alag hokar ek nai aabaadi ban jaati he
 Often this is due to geographical isolation
 is nai aabaadi main alilon kii aavruti aksar puraani aabaadi se alag hoti he
 The genetic designs of the next generations will depend on the genetic designs of the founders, which will be different from the older population
 sansthaapak ke prabhaav kaa ek udhaaharan amish logon ke 1744 ke pencilvenia deshaantaran se miltaa he
 The two founders of the Amishite colony of Pennsylvania had recessive alleles of the Ellis – van Kreveld syndrome
 amish logon kii apane samudaay ke baahar shaadi na karne kii pratha ke kai pidiyon tak chalane ke kaaran un main elice–vine creveld sanglakshan kii aavruti baaki aabaadi se kaafii zyada he

 Durga Bhabhi remained active with fellow revolutionaries despite her martyrdom
 9 oktober 1930 ko durga bhabhi ne governor heley par goli chalaa di thi jisamen governor heley to batch gaya lekin sainik adhikari tailor ghayal ho gaya
 Police Commissioner of Mumbai was also shot by Durga Bhabhi, as a result of which the British police fell behind them
 mumbai ke ek flats se durga bhabhi va saathi yashpal ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Durga Bhabhi's job was to bring and carry pistols from Rajasthan for fellow revolutionaries
 chandrashekhar aaazaad ne angrejon se ladate vakt jis pistaul se khud ko goli maari thi use durga bhabhi ne hi laakar unako di thi
 Durga Bhabhi was also with him at that time

 In unicellular beings, the zygote splits itself to produce new offspring, which is usually accomplished by the process of meiosis
 ankiy electronic yaa digital electronics electronics kii ek shakha he jisamen vidyut sanket ankiy hote hai
 Digital signals can be of many types, but binary digital signals are most commonly used
 shunya / ek, on / of, haan / nahin, lo / hai aadi binary sanketon ke kuch udhaaharan hai
 Digital electronic has become very important ever since integrated circuits have emerged and millions of electronic devices are being loaded into a small chip
 aadhunik vyaktigat computer tathaa cell-phone, digital camera aadi digital electronic kii dein hai
 Numerical electronics, or microtubule numerical method, is a system that represents electrical signals as a series of separate strips, rather than as a continuous band of linear levels
 is pattee ke sabhi str sanketon kii ek hi avasthaa ko darshaate hai
 Because of this separation of signs, relatively small changes in the level of linear signal due to the construction tolerance do not leave a separate cover
 jiske parinaam swarup sanketo kii avasthaa ko mahasoos karne vaala paripath inhe nazarandaaj kar detaa he
 In most cases the number of signal states is two and these two states are represented by two voltage levels: one and the other depending on the supply voltage in use
 1 is at high level and 0 is at low level
 aksar ye donon str "lo" or "hai" ke rup main pratinidhitiv karte hai
 The basic advantage of the numerical technique is based on the fact that instead of reproducing a continuous series of signals, it is easier to send the electronic device to a known state of signals such as 0 or 1
 digital electronics aam taur par logic gates ke vrihad sangyojan va bulian tark prakaarya ke saral electronix se banaaya jaataa he
 One of the advantages of using a numerical circuit compared to a linear circuit is that signals are not disrupted due to noise and can be easily sent and displayed

 One hour of music in a CD can be stored as about 60 million binary digits
 ek digital pranali main, ek adhik sateek sanket ke pratinidhitiv ke liye adhik binary ankon kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 However, this process requires more numerical circuits, since each digit is handled by the same type of hardware as a result, creating an easier scalable system

 Although a base station has grid power and can use the required power, a very flexible software radio
 The signaling process used in such new cellular standards can be easily reprogrammed for such base stations

 The senses belong to the world analog and the analog analog quantities from this world
 udhaaharan ke liye prakaash, taapmaana, dhwani, vidyut chaalakata, vidyut or chumbakeey aadhaar analog hai
 The most useful digital systems would be to continuously alter digital signals from analog signals
 yah parimanikaran trutiyon kaa kaaran banataa he
 The quantization error can be reduced if the system stores enough digital data to represent the desired degree of fidelity
 ek nirdhaarit analog sanket ko thik-thik prastut karne ke liye kitni digital data kii aavashyaktaa hoti he uski jaankaree niquist-shannon namoona prameya ek mahatvapurn nirdesh pradaan karata he
 In some systems, if a piece of digital data is lost or misappropriated, the vast amounts of related data can change its meaning completely
 kyonki clif effect ke kaaran, upyogkartaaon ke liye bataanaa mushkil he ki koi vishisht system vifaltaa ke kagaar par sahi tha yaa phir vah asafal hone se pehle bahut adhik shor ko sahan kar saktaa he yaa nahin
 Digital vulnerability can be reduced for robustness by designing a digital system
 udhaaharan ke liye ek parity bit yaa anya truti prabandhan paddati ko signal path main daalaa ja saktaa he
 This method helps the system detect errors and either correct the errors or at least ask for a new copy of the data
 ek state mashin main state transishan logic kaa aprayukt state ko pakadaney or ek riset anukram trigar yaa anya niyamit truti vasuuli ke liye dizin kiya ja saktaa he
 Embedded software design uses immunity aware programming, such as attempting to fill unused program memory with blocking instructions that point to an error recovery program
 is vifaltaa ke khilaaf raksha main madad karata he jo micro controlar anudesh suchak ko bigaad sakate hai, jo anyathaa yadrichhik code ke nishpadit kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 Technologies such as digital memory and transmission system error detection and correction can use additional data to correct any errors in transmission and storage
 duusari ore digital pranali main kuch takneekon kaa istemaal un pranaaliyon ke ekal bit trutiyon ko adhik kamjor banane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 These techniques are acceptable only when the underlying bits are significantly more reliable than those errors are unlikely to occur
 digital circuit analog ghatakon se bana hai
 Its design should ensure that the characteristics of analog components do not dominate the intended digital behavior
 Digital systems must manage noise and time margins, parasitic routing and capacitance, and filter power connections
 kharaab dizin main aantrayik samasya hoti he jaise gliches, gaayab hoti tej pulces jo ki dusron ko nahin lekin kuch logic ko gati pradaan kar sakate hai, "rant pulse" maanya seemaa voltage tak nahin pahunch pate hai yaa anpekshit logic stats kaa sangyojan hote hai
 Since digital circuits are composed of analog components, the digital circuit calculates slower than low-precision, which uses the same space and power

 a logic gate is an arrangement of electrically controlled switches
 ek logic get kaa output ek vidyut pravaah yaa voltage hota he jo adhikansh logic gates par niyantran or use mode saktaa he
 Often logic gates use the lowest number of transistors to reduce their size, power consumption and cost, and increase their reliability
 badi maatra main logic gates banane kaa ekikrut circuit kam se kam mahatvapurn tarika he
 Integrated circuits are typically designed by engineers using electronic design automation software
 digital circuit kaa doosraa rup lukup teble se nirmit hota he 
 Lookup tables can function like logic gates based on machines but can be easily reprogrammed without changing the strings
 iskaa arth yah he ki diziner, aksar taron kii vyavastha ko badale bina hi dizin trutiyon kii marammat kar sakate hai
 Therefore small amounts of product programmable logic devices are often the preferred solution

 Engineers adopt several methods to reduce logic functions, so as to reduce the complexity of the circuit
 jab jatilta kam hoti he tab circuit main trutiyaan or electronics bhi kam hoti hai or isliye ye kam mahange hote hai
 a minimization algorithm like the espresso heuristic logic minimizer is the most widely used simplification within a CAD system although historically binary decision diagrams have used an automated quine-mccluskey algorithm, truth tables, kernog maps, and Boolean algebra
 
 ejeeniyar ke digital circuit ke dizin ke liye pratinidhitiv mahatvapurn hai
 Some analysis methods only work with special representation
 logic geton ke samakaksh set ke saath digital circuit kaa pratinidhitiv shastreey tarika he
 Another approach is to construct a system often equivalent to electronic switches with minimal electronic
 sirf ek truth teble se yukt smriti aasaan tareekon main se ek hota he
 Inputs are inserted at the memory address and the data outputs of the memory become outputs
 swachaalit vishleshan ke liye in prativednon ke paas digital fil swaroop hote hai jise computer program dwaara process kiya ja saktaa he
 Most digital engineers are careful in selecting computer programs with a compatible file format
 prativedan ke liye ejeeniyar digital system ke prakaaron par vichaar karte hai
 Most digital systems are divided into "combinatorial systems" and "sequential systems"
 sangyojan pranali main hameshaa jo input diya jaataa he vahi output vah detaa he
 It basically represents the set of logic processes and which has already been discussed
 anukramik pranali input ke rup main daale gaye output ke saath ek sangyojan pranali he
 This allows the digital machine to operate operationally
 sabase saral anukramik pranali shaayad ek flip flop he, ek yantrawali jo ki ek binary ank yaa "bit" kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Sequential systems are often designed as state machines
 is tareeke se ejeeniyar ek system ke sakal vyavhaar ko dizin kar sakate hai or yahaan tak ki logic prakriyaayon ke vivaran par vichaar kiye bina satat anukaran main bhi iskaa pareekshan kar sakate hai, bina tark kaaryon ke sabhi vivaran par vichaar kiye
 The sequential system is further divided into two subcategories
 jab ek "clock" signal state ko parivartit karata he tab "tulykaalik" anukramik pranali ek hi baar main state ko badal detaa he
 "asynchronous" transmits a sequential system change whenever inputs change
 tulykaalik anukramik system atulykaalik circuit kii visheshta se bana hota he jaise flip flop, jo clock jab parivartan karata he tabhi ye parivartan karata he or jisamen timming margin ko dhyaan se dizin kiya jaataa he
 As usual, a synchronous sequential state machine is a practical way to implement by dividing it into a combinational logic and a set of flip flops called a "state register"
 har baar ek ghadi tik tik kii signal detii he or state register sangyojan logic ke pichley state se utpann pratikriya par kabja kar leti he or state mashin ke sangyojan bhaag main aparivertineeya input ke rup main phir se ise daal detii he
 In combination logic, the fastest clock rate is set by most of the time-consuming logic estimations
 state register sirf ek dwiadhari sankhya kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 If there are too many states in the state machine, the logic process is some combination logic that produces a number of states
 isaki tulana main atulykaalik system kaa dizin bahut kathin hota he kyonki sabhi sambhav samay main bhi sambhavit state kaa vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 According to the most common method of constructing the minimum and maximum time tables, the state is present in it and the circuit is adjusted to minimize the state and to make the circuit go periodically to the corresponding state of all its parts
 Force it
 Without such careful design, it is easy to produce coincidentally asynchronous logic that is "unstable" and is real electronics that has unpredictable consequences because of small changes in the value of electronic devices due to accumulated delays
 kuch circuit sahaj rup se apane dizin main antarnihit atulykaalik rahe hai or is tarah hi vishleshan kiya janaa chahie
 As of 2005 almost all digital machines are synchronous design because synchronous design is very easy to create and verify - currently the software that mimics digital machines does not handle asynchronous design
 However, asynchronous logic is better understood if it can be worked out, because its speed is not arbitrarily limited by the clock speed, instead, it operates normally at the speed allowed by the logic gates from which they are constructed
 has been done
 tej bhaagon ke upyog dwaara ek atulykaalik circuit nirmaan, apratyaksh rup se circuit ko tezi se "daudati" he
 Generally, many digital systems are data flow machines
 aksar inhen tulykaalik register hastantaran logic kaa upyog kar dizin kiya jaataa he or isamen VHDL yaa verilog hardware varnan bhashaaon ke rup main prayog kiya gaya he
 In register transfer logic, binary numbers are stored in groups of flip flops called registers
 prayek register kaa output taron kaa bandal he jise ek "bas" kaha jaataa he jo anya akalan ke liye us nambar ko paas rakhata he
 This assessment is only a part of combination logic
 prayek akalan ke paas ek bas output hota he or ye kai input registeron se judaa ho saktaa he
 Sometimes a register has a multiplexer on its input so that it can store numbers from any one of several buses
 vaikalpik rup se kai chizon ke output ko baphers ke madhyam se joda ja saktaa he jo ek ko chhodkar sabhi upkarnon ke output ko band kar saktaa he
 The sequential state machine controls when new data from each register is accepted from the input
 1980 ke dashak main kuch shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki lagbhag sabhi tulykaalik register-transfar mashiinon ko first-in-first-out tulykaalan logic kaa upyog karke atulykaalik diginon main parivartit kiya ja saktaa tha
 The digital machine, in this scheme, is identified as a set of data flows
 pravaah ke har kadam main, ek atulykaalik "tulykaalan circuit" nirdhaarit karata he jab us step kaa output thos or ek prastut sanket detaa he ki un stejon ko "data ko pakado" jisamen un stejon ke input main prayog hua he
 This requires some relatively simple synchronization circuits

 This micro program is like a player-piano roll
 har talika pravishti yaa sookshm program ke "shabd" state ke har bit ko cmand detii he jo ki computer par niyantran karti he
 The sequencer then counts it and addresses this count in a memory or combinational logic machine that contains the micro-program
 microprogram se bits ankaganitiya logic ikai, memory or computer ke anya bhaagon or swayan microsicyonsar par niyantran karata he
 In this way, the complex task of designing computer control was transformed into a relatively simple collection of logic machines

 Many computers are serving detailed apprenticeships as Architech microprogrammers
 "vishisht computer" aam taur par ek vishesh uddeshy ke sookshm program ke saath ek paaramparik computer hai
 To avoid costly engineering efforts, efforts to design large logic machines have been heavily automated
 computer program ko "electronic dizine swachaalan upkaran" yaa bas "EDA" kaha jaataa he
 a simple Truth table-style description of logic, often optimized with EDA that automatically generates reduced systems of logic gates or smaller lookup tables that still give the desired results
 is prakaar ke software kaa sabase saamaanya udhaaharan aspreso huristic logic minimiser he
 Most practical algorithms for optimizing large logic systems, using algebraic manipulations or binary decision diagrams and experiments with genetic algorithms and thermal optimization, are full of possibilities

 The state table is a piece of text that lists each state with conditions, which control the transition between them and the corresponding output signals
 yah aise computer utpann state mashiinon ke function teble ke liye aam he ki unhen logic minimiraseshan software minilog ke saath anukulit kiya jaae
 Often, real logic systems are designed as a series of sub-projects, which are combined using an "instrument flow"
 upkaran pravaah, aam taur par ek "script" hoti he, ek saral computer bhashaa jo sahi kram main software dizin upkarnon ko lagu kar sakati he
 Equipment flow for large logic systems, such as microprocessors, can be thousands of commands long and combine the work of hundreds of engineers

 Parts of the instrument flow are debugged by verifying the output of the simulated logic against the expected input
 pareekshan upkaran, input or output ke set ke saath computer filon ko lete hai or nakli vyavhaar or apekshit vyavhaar ke bich visangatiyon par prakaash daalate hai
 Once the input data is considered correct, the design itself must still be verified for correctness
 kuch upkaran pravaah, pehle ek dizine ke utpaadan dwaara dizin kii pushti karte hai or phir upkaran pravaah ke liye sangat input data ke utpaadan ke liye dizin kii scanning karte hai
 If the scanned data coincides with the input data, the instrument flow probably introduced no errors
 kaaryaatmak satyaapan data, aam taur par "pareekshan vector" kehalaate hai
 The functional test vector can be preserved and used in the factory to test whether the newly constructed logic works correctly

 These tests generate the vector, by examining the structure of logic and systematically generating tests for specific faults
 is tarah folt kawarej kareeb 100% tak pahunch saktaa he, basharte dizine ko thik tarah se pareekshan yogya banaaya gaya ho 
 Once a design exists and is verified and testable, it often needs to be processed to be product qualified

 kramik scan main, data le jane or baar-baar istemaal naa hone vaale test logic ke bhautik aakaar or kharche ko kam karne ke liye keval ek yaa do taar hote hai
 After all testing, the data bits are in place, the design is reconfigured to "normal mode" and one or more clock pulse is applied, so that faults can be detected and the scan results are captured
 Shift is done in flip-flops in the register and / or in laches

 The minimum practical fanout is around five
 aadhunik electronic logic jo switch ke liye CMOS transistor kaa upyog karte hai, unke paas kareeb pachaas ke aas-paas fainout hote hai or kabhi-kabhi bahut oonche ja sakate hai
 "switching speed" refers to how many times an inverter can change from true to false and back
 tej logic kam samay main adhik kaary ko puraa kar sakate hai
 Digital logic became useful for the first time when the switching speed was above fifty Hz, because it was faster than a team of humans operating mechanical calculators
 aadhunik electronic digital logic niyamit rup se paanch gigahertz par parivartit hote hai or kuch prayogshaala pranali ek terrahertz se adhik par parivartit hoti he
 Design started with Riley
 Relay logic was relatively cheap and reliable but slow
 kabhi-kabhi ek yantric vifaltaa bhi ghatit hoti thi
 Fanouts were typically ten, limited by the resistance of the coils and forming an arc upon contact with high voltage
 baad main, nirvaat tub kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 They were very fast, but produced heat and were unreliable due to the burning of the filaments
 fainout aam taur par paanch se saat the, jo tub ke vidyut se heating dwaara simit the
 In the 1950s, special "computer tubes" were developed with filaments that removed volatile elements like silicon
 ye kai hajaaron ghante tak chalate hai
 The first semiconductor logic family was resistor-transistor logic
 yah tub se hazaar guna adhik vishwasaneey tha, aaraam se chalata tha or kam bijli istemaal karata tha, lekin teenon main se bahut nune fain-in tha
 Diode-transistor logic improved fanout to seven and decreased power
 kuch DTL diginon ne fainout main vruddhi ke liye NPN or PNP transistoron kii paryayakramik paraton ke saath do bijli-aapurti kaa upyog kiya
 The transistor was a great improvement over the transistor logic Inn
 aarambhik upkarnon main, fainout das tak sudhara or baad ke viksit prakaar ne bees tak hasil kiya
 TTL was also fast, with some converts achieving a short time of twenty nanoseconds of switching
 TTL abhi bhi kuch dizin main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Another contender was Emitter Coupled Logic
 yah bahut tej he lekin bahut bijli upyog karata he
 It is now mostly used in radio frequency circuits
 aadhunik ekikrut paripath, zyaadaatar CMOS ke roopantaron kaa upyog karte hai, jo sweekaarya rup se tej, bahut chote or bahut kam bijli kaa prayog karte hai
 Fanouts of forty or more are possible with some speed fines
 gaiyr electronic digital tantra nirmaan sambhav he
 In theory, discrete state representation and any technique capable of representing logic functions can be used to construct mechanical logic
 MIT ke chaatro, arleen gi, edward hardbek, danni hilis, margaret minsaki or bairi or bryan silverman bhai, ne tinkar khilone, string, ek eent or ek teevr pencil se do computer kaa nirmaan kiya
 Tinkertoy Computer is at the Boston Science Museum
 logic get ke hydrolic, viviya or yantric sanskaran maujuud hai or aisi sthitiyon main istemaal kiye jate hai jahaan bijli kaa upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa
 pehle do prakaar ko fludiks ke tahat mana jaataa he
 One use of fluidic logic is in military hardware that is likely to be exposed to an electromagnetic pulse that destroys electrical circuits
 yantric tark aksar aisi washing mashin main un logon ke rup main saste niyantrakon main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Famously, the first computer design by Charles Babbage was designed to use mechanical logic
 yantric logic ko, bahut chote computer main bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he jise naino takanic dwaara banaaya ja saktaa he
 Another example is that if two special enzymes are required to prevent the formation of a particular protein, it is equivalent to a biological "NAND gate"

 Diazo compounds are a type of organic compound consisting of two linked nitrogen atoms as a function group
 iskaa saamaanya sutara R2C=N2 he
 Diazomethane is the simplest diazo-compound
 german rasayanajna peter greece ne 1858 i0 main sarvapratham arometic diazo yogicon kaa pataa lagaaya tha
 He was studying nitrous acid on aromatic primary amino compounds
 unhone dekha ki abhikriya kaa taap yadi shunya sein0 yaa iske aasapaas rakhaa jaay to praathmik amino nitras amla kii saamaanya kriya na hokar ek nayaa yogic banataa he, jo elifatic amino yogicon se nahin banataa
 He dubbed this new compound "diazo" and called this verb diazotization
 is kriya se bane yogicon ko diadonium yogic kaha
 These compounds are similar in some properties to ammonium compounds
 praathmik arometic amin ko kisi khanij amla ke aadhiky main ghulaakar uskaa taap shunya se 50 sein0 kar usamen sodium nitrite kaa vilyan daalane se diazo yogic banataa he, jo jal main viley hota he
 If ethyl alcohol is used in place of water, solid precipitate of diazo compound may be obtained
 jaleey vilyan se ether dwaara bhi thos yogic kaa avakshep praapt ho saktaa he
 Aqueous solution is sufficient to study its reactions
 diazo yogic rangahin thos manibh ke rup main banate hai
 They are very soluble in water, but less soluble in ether and alcohol
 ye bade asthaayee hote hai
 They are blasted very hard by heating or shock
 ammonium lavenon ke samaan hi ye amlon se lavan banaate or dhaatuon ke chlorideon se dwi-lavan banaate hai
 Diazo compounds are chemically very active
 inaki abhikriyaaon se anek prakaar ke yogic taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai
 The most important substances among them are artificial dyes, which are being manufactured on a very large scale today
 inaki abhikriyaaon ko pradarshit karne ke liye neeche, udhaahranswaroop, benzin diadonium chloride le rahe hai : 1
 Boiling it with pure alcohol replaces the diazo group with hydrogen: c6h5n2cl + C2H5OH --> C6H6 + N2 + CH3 CHO 2
 Chlorobanzene is obtained by heating cuprous chloride with a solution in hydrochloric acid
 isi prakaar kuprus bromide or kuprus cynide ke saath upachaar se kramash: bromobanzeen or benzin cynide, praapt hote hai
 This is called the "sandmire reaction"
 taanbe ke churna ke saath upachaar se bhi benzin chloride, bromide or cynide praapt hote hai
 This is called "gatraman reaction"
 3
 pani ke saath garam karne se diazo samooh kaa sthaan hydroxil samooh le letaa he
 Thus phenols can be prepared by this reaction
 c6h5n2cl + HOH --> C6H5OH + N2 + hcl 4
 In the presence of azal aluminum chloride, the reaction with benzene replaces the diazo group with the phenyl group
 c6h5n2cl + C6H6 --> C6H5
C6H5 + N2 + hcl 5
 Treatment of stannous chloride and hydrochloric acid leads to the degradation of the diazo group to form hydrazine compounds
 c6h5n2cl + 4H --> C6H5NH NH2 + hcl 6
 Treatment of diazonium salts in the alkaline state with phenol, or tertiary amine, produces acidic or coaxial yellow, red, or brown pigments
 c6h5n2cl + C6H5OH --> C6H5N2
C6H4
OH + hcl c6h5n2cl + C6H5N2 -> C6H5N2C6H4N2 + hcl uparyukt abhikriyaaon ko yugman abhikriya kehete hai
 Diazotation reactions occur from almost all primary amino compounds of the aromatic category
 arometic diazo yogicon ke sanghatan ke sambandh main blomustrand ne jo sutara prastaavit kiya tha, vah aaj bhi sarvamaanya he
 The formula of benzene diazchloride, in which one nitrogen atom is trivalent and the other atom is a five-adductor, is as follows: elifatic shrenee ke bahut thode diazo yogic hi gyaat hai or vishesh vidhiyon se hi ve teyar hote hai
 In such compounds, diazomethane and diazo acetic esters are of greater importance
