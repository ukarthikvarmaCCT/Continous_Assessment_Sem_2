 Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark was born in Mon Repos on the Greek island of Corfu on 10 June 1921, the only son and fifth and final child of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg
 Philip's four elder sisters were Margarita, Theodora, Cecilie, and Sophie
 He was baptized into the Greek Orthodox Church
 His godparents were Queen Olga of Greece and the Mayor of Corfu
 Shortly after Philip's birth, his maternal grandfather, Prince Louis of Battenberg, then known as Louis Mountbatten, Marquess of Milford Haven, died in London
 Louis was a naturalised British citizen, who, after a career in the Royal Navy, had renounced his German titles and adopted the surname Mountbatten during the First World War
 After visiting London for the memorial, Philip and his mother returned to Greece where Prince Andrew had remained behind to command an army division embroiled in the greco-turkish War 
 The war went badly for Greece, and the Turks made large gains
 On 22 September 1922, Philip's uncle, King Constantine I, was forced to abdicate, and the new military government arrested Prince Andrew, along with others
 The commander of the army, General Georgios Hatzianestis, and five senior politicians were executed
 Prince Andrew's life was believed to be in danger, and Alice was under surveillance
 In December, a revolutionary court banished Prince Andrew from Greece for life
 The British naval vessel HMS Calypso evacuated Prince Andrew's family, with Philip being carried to safety in a cot made from a fruit box
 Philip's family went to France, where they settled in the Paris suburb of saint-cloud in a house lent to them by his aunt, Princess George of Greece and Denmark
 Because he left the country as a baby, he does not have a strong grasp of Greek
 In 1992 Philip said that he "could understand a certain amount of" the language
 Philip was first educated at an American school in Paris run by Donald macjannet, who described Philip as a "rugged, boisterous 


 but always remarkably polite" boy
 In 1928, he was sent to Britain to attend Cheam School, living with his maternal grandmother at Kensington Palace and his uncle, George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven, at Lynden Manor in Bray, Berkshire
 In the next three years, his four sisters married German princes and moved to Germany, his mother was placed in an asylum after being diagnosed with schizophrenia, and his father moved to a small flat in Monte Carlo
 Philip had little contact with his mother for the remainder of his childhood
 In 1933, he was sent to Schule Schloss Salem in Germany, which had the "advantage of saving school fees" Because it was owned by the family of his brother-in-law, Berthold, Margrave of Baden
 With the rise of Nazism in Germany, Salem's Jewish founder, Kurt Hahn, fled persecution and founded Gordonstoun School in Scotland
 After two terms at Salem, Philip moved to Gordonstoun
 In 1937, his sister Cecilie, her husband, her two young sons and her mother-in-law were killed in an air crash at Ostend; Philip, then sixteen years old, attended the funeral in Darmstadt
 The following year, his uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of cancer of the bone marrow
 her two young sons and her mother-in-law were killed in an air crash at Ostend; Philip, then sixteen years old, attended the funeral in Darmstadt
 The following year, his uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of cancer of the bone marrow
 her two young sons and her mother-in-law were killed in an air crash at Ostend; Philip, then sixteen years old, attended the funeral in Darmstadt
 The following year, his uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of cancer of the bone marrow
 After leaving Gordonstoun in 1939, Prince Philip joined the Royal Navy, graduating the next year from the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, as the best cadet in his course
 During the Second World War, he continued to serve in the British forces, while two of his brothers-in-law, Prince Christopher of Hesse and Berthold, Margrave of Baden, fought on the opposing German side
 He was commissioned as a midshipman in January 1940
 Philip spent four months on the battleship HMS Ramillies, protecting convoys of the Australian Expeditionary Force in the Indian Ocean, followed by shorter postings on HMS Kent, on HMS Shropshire and in Ceylon 
 After the invasion of Greece by Italy in October 1940, he was transferred from the Indian Ocean to the battleship HMS Valiant in the Mediterranean Fleet
 Among other engagements, Philip was involved in the Battle of Crete, and was mentioned in despatches for his service during the Battle of Cape Matapan, in which he controlled the battleship's searchlights
 He was also awarded the Greek War Cross of Valor
 Duties of lesser glory included stoking the boilers of the troop transport ship RMS Empress of Russia
 He was promoted to sub-lieutenant after a series of courses at Portsmouth in which he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the qualifying examination
 In June 1942, he was appointed to the v and w class destroyer and flotilla leader, HMS Wallace, which was involved in convoy escort tasks on the east coast of Britain, as well as the allied invasion of Sicily
 Promotion to lieutenant followed on 16 July 1942
 In October of the same year he became first lieutenant of HMS Wallace, at 21 years old one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy
 During the invasion of Sicily, in July 1943, as second in command of HMS Wallace, he saved his ship from a night bomber attack
 He devised a plan to launch a raft with smoke floats that successfully distracted the bombers allowing the ship to slip away unnoticed
 In 1944, he moved on to the new destroyer, HMS Whelp, where he saw service with the British Pacific Fleet in the 27th Destroyer Flotilla
 He was present in Tokyo Bay when the instrument of Japanese surrender was signed
 In January 1946, Philip returned to the United Kingdom on the Whelp, and was posted as an instructor at HMS Royal Arthur, the Petty Officers' School in Corsham, Wiltshire
 In 1939, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth
 During the visit, the Queen and Earl Mountbatten asked Philip to escort the King's two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, who were Philip's third cousins through Queen Victoria, and second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark
 Elizabeth fell in love with Philip and they began to exchange letters when she was thirteen
 Speaking, in the summer of 1946, Philip asked the King for his daughter's hand in marriage
 The King granted his request, provided that any formal engagement be delayed until Elizabeth's twenty-first birthday the following April
 By March 1947, Philip had abandoned his Greek and Danish royal titles, had adopted the surname Mountbatten from his mother's family, and had become a naturalized British subject
 Philip and Elizabeth were married in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey, recorded and broadcast by BBC radio to 200 million people around the world
 However, in post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for any of the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations to be invited to the wedding, including Philip's three surviving sisters, all of whom had married German princes, some of them with Nazi connections
 After their marriage, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh took up residence at Clarence House
 Their first two children were born: Prince Charles in 1948 and Princess Anne in 1950
 Philip returned to the navy after his honeymoon, at first in a desk job at the Admiralty, and later on a staff course at the Naval Staff College, Greenwich
 From 1949, he was stationed in Malta after being posted as the first lieutenant of the destroyer HMS Checkers, the lead ship of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet
 On 16 July 1950, he was promoted lieutenant commander and given command of the frigate HMS Magpie
 He was promoted to commander in 1952, but his active naval career ended in July 1951
 With the King in ill health, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh were both appointed to the Privy Council on 4 November 1951, after a coast-to-coast tour of Canada
 At the end of January 1952, Philip and his wife set out on a tour of the Commonwealth
 On 6 February 1952, when they were in Kenya, Elizabeth's father died and she became queen
 It was Philip who broke the news of her father's death to Elizabeth at Sagana Lodge, and the royal party immediately returned to the United Kingdom
 The accession of Elizabeth to the throne brought up the question of the name of the royal house
 The Duke's uncle, Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, advocated the name House of Mountbatten, as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name on marriage; However, when Queen Mary, Elizabeth's paternal grandmother, heard of this suggestion, she informed the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who herself later advised the Queen to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor
 Churchill's strong personal antipathy to Lord Mountbatten, whom he considered a dangerous and subversive rival who had lost India, may have contributed to this
 The Duke privately complained, "I am nothing but a bloody amoeba
 On 8 February 1960, several years after the death of Queen Mary and the resignation of Churchill, the Queen issued an Order in Council declaring that the surname of male-line descendants of the Duke and the Queen who are not styled as Royal Highness, or titled as Prince or Princess, was to be mountbatten-windsor
 While it seems the Queen had "absolutely set her heart" on such a change and had it in mind for some time, it occurred only eleven days before the birth of Prince Andrew, and only after three months of protracted correspondence between the constitutional expert Edward Iwi and the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan 
 After her accession to the throne, the Queen also announced that the Duke was to have "place, pre-eminence and precedence" next to her "on all occasions and in all meetings, except where otherwise provided by Act of Parliament"
 This meant the Duke took precedence over his son, the Prince of Wales, except, officially, in the British parliament
 In fact, however, he attends Parliament only when escorting the Queen for the annual State Opening of Parliament, where he walks and sits beside her
 Contrary to rumours over the years, the Queen and Duke are said by insiders to have had a strong relationship throughout their marriage, despite the challenges of Elizabeth's reign
 The Queen referred to Prince Philip in a speech on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 as her "constant strength and guide"
 During his wife's Golden Jubilee in 2002, the Duke was commended by the Speaker of the British House of Commons for his role in supporting the Queen during her reign
 The Duke of Edinburgh's time as royal consort exceeds that of any other consort in British history; However, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, who died aged 101, was the consort with the longest lifespan
 In April 2008, Philip was admitted to the King Edward VII Hospital for "assessment and treatment" for a chest infection, though he walked into the hospital unaided and recovered quickly, and was discharged three days later to recuperate at Windsor Castle
 In August, the Evening Standard reported that he was suffering from prostate cancer
 Buckingham Palace, which usually refuses to comment on rumours of ill health, claimed that the report was an invasion of privacy and issued a statement denying the story
 The newspaper retracted the report and admitted it was untrue
 In June 2011, in an interview marking his 90th birthday he said that he would now slow down and reduce his duties, stating that he had "done bit"
 His wife, the Queen, gave him the title Lord High Admiral for his 90th birthday
 While staying at the royal residence at Sandringham, Norfolk, on 23 December 2011, the Duke suffered chest pains and was taken to the cardio-thoracic unit at Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, where he underwent successful coronary angioplasty and stenting
 He was discharged on 27 December
 On 4 June 2012, during the celebrations in honour of his wife's Diamond Jubilee, Philip was taken from Windsor Castle to the King Edward VII Hospital, London, suffering from a bladder infection
 He was released from hospital on 9 June
 After a recurrence of infection in August 2012, while staying at Balmoral Castle, he was admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for five nights as a precautionary measure
 In June 2013, Philip was admitted to the London Clinic for an exploratory operation on his abdomen, spending 11 days in hospital
 On 21 May 2014, the Prince appeared in public with a bandage on his right hand after a "minor procedure" was performed in Buckingham Palace the preceding day
 He is the longest-lived male member of the British royal family
 The record for the longest-lived male descendant of Queen Victoria is currently held by Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg who lived to be 95 years, 6 months and 5 days old
 Prince Philip would surpass this record on 15 December 2016
 Philip played polo until 1971, when he started to compete in carriage driving, a sport which he helped expand; the early rule book was drafted under his supervision
 He was a keen yachts sailor, striking up a friendship in 1949 with Uffa Fox in Cowes
 He and the Queen regularly attended Cowes Week in HMY Britannia
 His first airborne flying lesson took place in 1952; by his 70th birthday he had accrued 5,150 pilot hours
 He was presented with Royal Air Force wings in 1953
 In April 2014, it was reported that an old British Pathe newsreel film had been discovered of Philip's 1962 two-month flying tour of South America
 Filmed sitting alongside Philip at the aircraft's controls was his co-pilot Peter Middleton, the grandfather of the Duke's granddaughter-in-law, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge
 He has painted with oils, and collected artworks, including contemporary cartoons, which hang at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Sandringham House, and Balmoral Castle
 Hugh Casson described Philip's own artwork as "exactly what you'd expect 


 totally direct, no hanging about
 Strong colors, vigorous brushstrokes
" In 1979, when Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were guests of US President Jimmy Carter, Prince Philip was approached by White House butler Lynwood Westray and another unnamed butler
 Westray asked him "your majesty, would you like a cordial?", and Prince Philip responded, "i'll take one if you'll let me serve you"
 "oh my God, this had never happened before," said Westray
 "there we were standing there
 i was holding the glasses and my buddy was holding the liqueurs and we looked at each other, and i said 'if that's the only way you'll have it, we'll go along with it
' And the prince served us what he was having, and the three of us had a drink and a conversation
 It was an honour to let him do it
" Over his sixty years as royal consort, Philip has become famous for making remarks that were often construed as being offensive or stereotypical in nature
 Some of them were immediately interpreted as gaffes; but other awkward observations were construed by apologists as merely odd, off-color, and often funny
 In his own words, comments attributed to Prince Philip have contributed to the perception that he is "a cantankerous old sod"
 The historian David Starkey has described him as a kind of "HRH Victor Meldrew"
 For example, in May 1999 British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying, "no wonder you are deaf listening to this row
" Later Philip wrote, "the story is largely invention
 In a private conversation with British students from Xi'an's North West University, Philip joked, "if you stay here much longer, you'll go slit-eyed
" The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were denied unconcerned
 Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go "round-eyed"
 His comment had no effect on sino-british relations, but it shaped his own reputation

 Philip has been a Freemason since 1953
 Philip has held a number of titles throughout his life
 Originally holding the title and style of a prince of Greece and Denmark, Philip abandoned these royal titles prior to his marriage, and was thereafter created a British duke, among other noble titles
 It was not, however, until the Queen issued Letters Patent in 1957 that Philip was again titled as a prince
 When addressing the Duke of Edinburgh, as with any male member of the royal family except the monarch, the rules of etiquette are to address him the first time as Your Royal Highness, and thereafter as Sir
 The Duke of Edinburgh was appointed by King George VI to the Order of the Garter on 19 November 1947, the eve of his wedding
 Since then, Philip has received 17 different appointments and decorations in the Commonwealth, and 48 from foreign states
 The inhabitants of some villages on the island of Tanna, Vanuatu also worship Prince Philip as a god; the islanders possess portraits of the Duke and hold feasts on his birthday
 Upon his wife's accession to the throne in 1952, the Duke was appointed Admiral of the Sea Cadet Corps, colonel-in-chief of the British Army Cadet Force, and Air commodore-in-chief of the Air Training Corps
 The following year, he was appointed to the equivalent positions in Canada, and made Admiral of the Fleet, Captain General Royal Marines, Field Marshal, and Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom
 Subsequent military appointments were made in New Zealand and Australia
 To celebrate his 90th birthday, the Queen appointed him Lord High Admiral of the Royal Navy and Canada appointed him to the highest ranks available in all three branches of the Canadian Armed Forces
 saanchaa:infobox COA wide Philip is the oldest living great-great-grandchild of Queen Victoria, as well as her oldest living descendant following the death of Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg on 5 May 2012
 Through his descent from the British royal family, he is in the line of succession to the thrones of the 16 Commonwealth realms
 In July 1993, through mitochondrial DNA analysis of a sample of Prince Philip's blood, British scientists were able to confirm the identity of the remains of several members of Empress Alexandra of Russia's family, several decades after their 1918 massacre by the Bolsheviks
 Prince Philip was then one of two living great-grandchildren in the female line of Alexandra's mother Princess Alice of the United Kingdom, the other being his sister Sophie, who died in 2001

 Computer virtualization is concerned with reducing computer resources, such as the process of running two or more logical computer systems on a set of physical hardware
 The concept came into existence in the 1960s with the IBM mainframe operating system, but was commercialized only in the 1990s for x86-compatible computers

 vastav main ye niyam jo bahut varshon pehle banaae gaye the, starit shailavigyaan ke vishay main sampurna vivaran dene main asamarth hai
 The history of the development of the earth is not as simple as the development of man
 prithvi kaa itihaas manushya ke itihaas se kahin zyada ulajhaa hua he
 Time has repeatedly tried to erase old evidence
 samay ke saath saath aagney kriya, kayantaran or shailasamoohon ke sthanantaran ne bhi prithvi ke rup ko badal diya he
 Thus, on the basis of the present evidence and the rules given above, three billion years old history of the earth cannot be written
 prithvi kaa puraatan itihaas jaanane ke liye or bahut si duusari baton kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 The main objective of layered stylists is to analyze, nomenclature, classify and identify the similarities found in rock formations at a place
 usko puraatan jeev, bhugol or jalwaayu kaa bhi vistrut vivaran dena hota he
 The goal of layered rockologists is to present a serial description of all the events that have occurred since the birth of the Earth
 prithvi ke anchal main ek vistrut pradesh nihit he
 Therefore, it is natural that the same conditions will not be found in every part of it
 beete hue yug main bahut se bhoumikeey or vayumandaleey parivartan hue hai
 Due to these reasons, the entire history of the earth is not stored in any region
 prayek mahadweep ke itihaas main bahut si nunataayen hai
 That is why the entire history of the earth is created on the basis of evidence collected from each continent
 kintu yah aisa dhang he jiske upar purna vishwaas nahin kiya ja saktaa or isiilie prithvi ke vibhinn bhaagon main paae janevaale shailasamoohon ke bich bilkul sahi samatulyata sthapit karnaa sambhav nahin he
 In order to overcome these difficulties layered stylists use isotopic terms instead of equivalence which means similarity of arrangement
 puratanyug main jeevon kaa vikaas ekaroopen or samaan nahin tha
 Atmospheric conditions also change the order of biology
 jo jeev samshitoshna jalwaayu main bahutayat se paae jate hai ve ooshna jalwaayu main jivit nahin rah paayenge yaa unki sankhya main baari kami ho jaaegi
 Some of us do not like the desert climate but many people live in this climate
 is prakaar jeevvikas prithvi ke prayek bhaag main ek gati se nahin hua he
 Today, the remains of some organisms found in Australia have been found in the midlife of Europe
 isliye yah kahana uchit na hoga ki in donon ke prithvi par avataran kaa samay ek he
 Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion, whose followers are called Christians
 isai dharm ke anuyaayi isa messiah kii shiksha par chalate hai
 There are many communities among Christians such as Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox, Avanzilak etc
 isai dharm ke anusaar jeev hatya, anaavashyak hare pedo kii kataai ,kisi ko vyarth aghat pahunchaana, vyarth jal bahaanaa, aadi paap he
 The Bible is the scripture of Christianity
 isai akeshwarwadi hai, lekin ve ishwar ko triek ke rup main samajhate hai -- parampita parameshwar, unke putr isa messiah or pavitra aatma
 The Supreme Father is the creator of this world and its ruler
 isa messiah koun the jinhen aaj vishwa ke sabase zyada log puja karte he ? Jesus himself was the angel of God who came into the world incarnate to save all fallen men from sin and death
 parameshwar jo aatma hai ek deh main pragat hue taaki paapi manushyon ko nahin parantu manushyon ke andar ke paapon ko khatm karen
 He was the first God on this earth who took the side of sinners, sick, fools and persecutors and paid the price of sin for himself in return so that human beings could escape
 Jesus Christ is forgiven for our sins, so we get forgiveness from our sins
 yah paapi manushya or pavitra parameshwar ke milan kaa mishan tha jo prabhu yishu ke qurabaani se puraa hua
 Being a divine God, he did not kill sinners but treated sin
 yah baat parameshwar pita kaa manushyon ke prati atoot prem ko pragat karata he
 God, rescuing human beings in the flesh from sin, is an introduction to Jesus Christ
 yishu messiah parameshwar the isi baat par aaj kaa isai dharm kaa aadhaar he
 He himself said i am !!! Jesus Christ was a Jew who was born in Bethlehem, a village in Israel, Israel
 isai maanate hai ki unki mata maaria kuwanri thim
 Jesus came miraculously into His womb by the grace of God the Father
 isa ke bare main yahudee nabiyon ne bhavishyavaanee kii thi ki ek maseehaa janm legaa
 Some people believe that Jesus also came to India
 baad main isa ne israel main yahudiyon ke bich prem kaa sandesh sunaaya or kaha ki wo hi ishwar ke putr hai
 The orthodox Jewish religious leaders erupted on these things, and at their behest, the Roman governor of Israel gave Jesus the crucifixion of death
 isai maanate hai ki iske teen din baad isa kaa punarutthan hua yaa isa punerjeevit ho gayi
 The teachings of Jesus are outlined in the New Testament of the Bible by his disciples
 pavitra aatma triek parameshwar ke tisare vyaktitv hai jinke prabhaav main vyakti apane andar ishwar kaa ahsaas karata he
 They direct the church and followers of Jesus
 isai dharmagranth bible main do bhaag hai
 The first part and the scripture of the Jews are the same
 doosraa bhaag isa ke upadesh, chamatkaar or unke shishyon ke kaam se rishta rakhata he
 The main denominations of Christians are: roman catholic rome ke pope ko sarvocch dharmaguru maanate hai
 Protestants do not believe in a pope and instead have full reverence in the Holy Bible
 madhya yug main janata ke bible padhne ke liye nakal karnaa manaa tha
 Due to which people did not have proper knowledge of Christianity
 kuch bishap or padrione ise sachche christi dharm ke anusaar nahin samajha or bible kaa apni apni bhashaao main bhashaantar karne lage, jise pope kaa virodh tha
 Those bishops and Padreone separated from the pope and established a new sect which is a Protestant
 kopimiism vidya nakal karne kaa adhikaar yaa license ko vishwaas nahin karata
 It begins with a Bible phrase: orthodox rome ke pope ko nahin maanate, par apane-apane rashtriya dharmasangh ke patriark ko maanate hai or paramparawaadi hote hai
