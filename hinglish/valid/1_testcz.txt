In any office, the number of employees who work hard and work from their time can be counted on their fingers
 aise karmchaaree agar mil bhi jaaen to wo offis ke adiyal ravaiye ke chalate tikkar kaam nahin kar pate he
 Learn what those are the five main reasons why good employees quit their jobs
 1
 If the hard-working worker is not encouraged at the right time, then his attitude towards work changes
 thode samay tak to vah puri mehnat se kaam karata he lekin phir halke main lekar bas kaam nipta detaa he
 2
 kai baar offis main karmchaariyon par itnaa kaam daal diya jaataa he ki vah khud ko ek robot samajhane lagate hai
 In this way, no employee can work long hours
 natijan vah company se nikalne ke vikalp talash kar letaa he
 3
 jab karmchaariyon kii lagan ko ecoffihalke main lete hue yah maan letaa he ki ye uskaa kaam he or is baat kii use selary di jaati he
 Always in such an environment it is better to leave the employee job
 4
 When your work in the office starts to be compared to others, you still feel uncomfortable in the office
 5
 The biggest reason for quitting the job is the boss, because often there are bosses who believe in listening to themselves rather than listening

 Several months before the Pulwama attack, Maulana Masood Azhar, the chief of the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammad, was conspiring with the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI to terrorize India from Delhi to Kashmir
 is sajeesh ke liye wo lagaataar jammu kashmir ke naujavaanon ko apni jahrili takareeron ke jariye bharat ke khilaaf bhadkaa bhi rahaa tha
 Recently, the most wanted terrorist of India, Maulana Masood, is telling the Kashmiri youth in one of his audio, 'kashmir youngsters, is the Osman son's martyrdom not enough to make you stand up? india ne aapako ye apshan diya he yaa kufrat kii yaar karo
 Confess slavery or die with greed
 aap ye donon apshan uske munh par maar kar izzat or shahadat ke raste par aa jaaen
 'this is the latest audio of Maulana Masood Azhar from Delhi Police Special Cell and Military Intelligence
 darasal, 24 janvari ko dilli police special cell or miletry intelligence ne dilli se jaish ke aatanki abdul latif gani ko giraftaar kiya tha or gani kii poochtacha ke baad jammu kashmir se hilaal ahamed bhatta ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 It was only after the arrest of these two that the conspiracy of a major attack of Jaish was exposed in Delhi
 giraftaar kiye gaye jaish ke donon hi aatankiyon kii mobile masping main khufia agenciyon ke haath moulana masood ajahar kaa taaja audio or ek video bhi laga tha
 Which revealed that Maulana Masood has been furious after the terrorist Usman was killed by the army in the valley and is plotting a major attack in India
 darasal, moulana jis osman bete kaa zikr apane taaja audio main kar rahaa he, wo koi or nahin balki uskaa apana bhatija hi he
 In the year 2018, the army killed Maulana Masood Azhar's nephew Usman in an operation
 jiske baad se hi moulana badale kii aag main jhulas rahaa tha
 Not only this, Maulana was repeatedly inciting Kashmiri youth against India by citing Usman in his poisonous arguments
 moulana apane audio main bharat ko ukhaad phenkane kii baat kar rahaa he
 By the way, the dream of weakening Maulana India has been under the patronage of Pakistani intelligence agencies for many years
 jo kabhi puraa hone vaala to nahin hi he
 But through his poisonous squabbles, he is encouraging the youth of Kashmir to go to the swamp of Jihad

 bombai hai court ne mangalvaar ko maharashtra sarkaar se sainitory napkin kii keemten ghataane or iske istemaal ke bare main jaagarukta badhaane kaa nirdesh diya he
 The Bombay High Court has asked the state government to give a concession on sanitary napkins
 justise en ech patil or en dablyoo sambrey kii divijan bench ne kaha, yah ek bahut mahatwoopurna mudda he jisase kareeb aadhi aabaadi prabhavit hoti he
 The court said this during the hearing of a PIL
 enjio shetty women welfare foundation ne zyada keemton or jaagarukta kii vajah se 80 pratishat mahilaon tak sainitory napkin naa pahunchane kii baat kehete hue yah janhit yachika daayar kii thi
 The 12 percent GST imposed on sanitary napkins has also been challenged in this PIL
 janhit yachika kii sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne kaha ki sarkaar tay kare ki use sainitory napkin ke istemaal or unki uplabdhta badhaane ke liye kya kadam uthaane hai
 It is a very important issue and affects half the population, the Division Bench said
 justise patil ne maharashtra sarkaar se sawaal kiya ki rajya sarkaar ne sainitory napkin ke istemaal ke bare main jaagarukta badhaane ke liye kya kiya he? justise patil ne aage kaha ki sarkaar kaa pehla kadam jaagarukta badhanaa or doosraa kadam sainitory napkin ko sabsidi vaali keemton par uplabdh karana hona chahie
 The bench also suggested that the state government should issue such guidelines to the gram panchayats so that women members of the panchayats can spread awareness among the girls
 court ne sambandhit vibhaagon ke pradhan sachiv or sachiv ko bhi is mudde par charchaa karne ke nirdesh die
 The court said that it would be better if the Additional Solicitor General helps the court on the matter of GST on sanitary napkins
 court ne rajya sarkaar ko do saptaah ke bheetar vistrut jawaab dene ke liye kaha he
 Ever since the imposition of 12 per cent GST on sanitary napkins, many women's organizations and ngos have put their demands before the government, but despite many promises nothing concrete has been done

 The book claimed that it was here that the meeting was held in the evening in which Vajpayee told the DPT, 'indira did not learn anything from her father Nehru

 'this anecdote has been written by famous TV journalist Vijay Trivedi in his book - Haaron Mein Nahin - An Atal Jeevan saga referring to a friend of Vajpayee
 duniyabar main ek ore jahaan vibhinn tarah kii bimaariyaan har saal lakhon logon kii jaan le leti hai
 At the same time, there are also millions of people who become enemies of their own lives due to any reason and by taking steps like suicide, it gives rise to fresh debate on the structure, thinking and concerns of the society
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan (dablyuechao) ke mutabik vishwa main har saal kareeb 10 lakh log vahya evam aantarik kaarnon ke chalate aatmahatya karte hai
 On average, one death by suicide is attempted every 40 minutes and every three minutes
 logon main aatmahatya kii badhati pravriti par roak lagane or iske prati jaagrukta paidaa karne ke uddeshy se dablyuechao ne vishvabhar main 10 sitambar ko vishwa aatmahatya nishedh diwas kii shuruyaat kii
 The non-government Organization (NGO) Suicide Prohibition International Organization (IASP) plays a key role in this WHO campaign
 varsh 1960 main sthapit is sanghathan main shaamil 50 se adhik deshon ke peshewar or swayamsevak aatmahatya rokthaam ke prayaason main apni sevaayen dete aa rahe hai
 If we talk about India in terms of suicide, then the suicide statistics here are quite predictable
 dablyuechao kii maane to bharat main har saal kareeb ek lakh log aatmahatya karte hai
 According to the WHO, there is obviously a need for a national plan for suicide prevention in India

 68 of these
 7 fisadi logon kii umr 15 se 44 varsh ke bich thi
 According to NCRB data, eight suicides each day in the country were caused by poverty, 73 suicides were due to diseases, nine suicides were declared bankrupt
 iske alaava 82 aatmahatyaayein paariwarik samasyaon ke chalate, 10 aatmahatyaayein prem sambandhon main naakaami kii vajah se, chah pariksha main asafal hone par, saat berogari kii vajah se, 128 aatmahatyaayein 0 se 29 aayu varg ke bich, 119 30 se 44 aayu varg ke bich or 101 aatmahatyaayein 45 varsh umr ke logon ne kii
 There were 69 housewives among the over 125 women who committed suicide while 223 men committed suicide in a single day
 swasthya peshey se jude log aatmahatya ko nitant nijee or jaateey maamla bhi maanate hai
 They hold many personal and social factors responsible for suicidal behavior such as divorce, dowry, love affairs, marital barriers, inappropriate pregnancies, extramarital affairs, domestic strife, debt, poverty, unemployment and educational problems
 maansik swasthya se jude kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki aatmahatya kii pravriti roki nahin ja sakati kyonki aatmahatya kii vajah zyaadaatar saamaajik evam vyakti ke parivesh se judi hoti he jis par vyakti kaa bahut hi kam niyantran hota he
 Researches have also revealed that an alternative solution to the problem is also faced by the person who takes suicidal steps, but the frustrated and frustrated person often forgets to consider suicide a permanent diagnosis of a temporary problem
 bharat ke samaksh jahaan pehle se hi sankramak bimaariyaan, kuposhan, shishu evam matra mrityu dar or anya gambheer swasthya samasyaayein maujuud hai
 In such a situation, suicide is not included in the government's health priority

 Narendra Modi emerged as the hero of the biggest victory in the history of BJP on this day five years ago
 unke sir jeet kaa sehara bandhaa or gujarat ke siem se desh ke piem bane
 From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, BJP had managed to feed lotus
 modi ke satta ke singhaasana par virajman hone ke baad uttar se dakshin or purab se pashchim tak modi lahar ke sahare bijpi ne camel khilaakar puure desh ko bhagava rang main rang diya
 Narendra Modi, who reached Parliament for the first time in 2014, gave the slogan of 'congress Mukt Bharat' as soon as he took over as the Prime Minister
 iske baad beete 5 saalon main bijepi ne piem modi ke netritv main ek ke baad ek chunaav main congress ko kai rajyon main haraaya
 The condition of the 132-year-old Congress, which once ruled the entire country, is today that it has been reduced to just 5 states in the entire country
 aazaadee ke baad se aisa pehali baar he jab congress kii aisi buree haalat hui he
 Explain that after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister in the year 2014, assembly elections were held in 25 states out of which BJP has formed government in 13 states
 pichley 5 saalon main jahaan bijepi-endie 8 rajyon se badhkar 20 rajyon main pahunch gai hai vahiin, congress 14 se ghatakar ab sirf teen rajyon main simat gai he thi
 But in the elections held in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh in 2018, the Congress came back and BJP got defeated
 is tarah se congress kii sarkaron kaa kuch aankada badha
 In the last 5 years, BJP has formed its government in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Manipur, Goa, Gujarat, Himachal, Meghalaya, Tripura, Nagaland
 iske alaava bihar main bijepi ko haar mili thi lekin kareeb dedh saal baad hi uskaa gathbandhan jediu ke saath hua or is tarah bijepi yahaan bhi satta main aa gai
 The BJP emerged as the single largest party in Karnataka, but failed to prove its majority as the government failed
 beete paanch saal main naa sirf bijepi ne congress ko haraaya he balki kshetreey dalon par bhi wo baari padi he
 Even now she is defeating the Left in the north-east
 vahiin kashmir main bhi bijepi ne pidipi ke saath milakar sarkaar banane main kaamyaab rahi thi
 But this alliance broke in Kashmir in 2018
 kabhi puure desh par raaj karne vaali congress kii haalat yah ho gai thi ki sirf 2 rajyon (mizoram,punjab) or ek centre shasit pradesh puducheri kii satta par kabiz thi, lekin disambar 2018 main congress ne jabardast vaapasi kii
 Congress formed governments in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh in the Legislative Assembly of five states, but lost to Mizoram
 is tarah se congress maujuuda samay main congress kii paanch rajyon main sarkaar he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has completed a five-year journey at the Center
 is tarah se narendra modi ke netritv main bijepi apni raajnneetik itihaas main sabase zyada siton par is baar chunavi maidan main utari he
 BJP president Amit Shah has claimed to win over 300 seats

 Nowadays people do not consider the nutrients of the diet in the greed of taste and we are deprived of the nutrition that we get easily, one such nutritional element is bran which is filtered and separated and thrown into the garbage
 It is given that a person who is interested that there is no obstruction in his body should give special importance to bran in his diet, because the remaining portion of the food is taken out Bran is helpful in extracting and does not allow stool to be blocked in the intestines
 Unnatural diet and irregular routines cause intestinal obstruction! This obstruction of feces is called constipation! Due to constipation, rot caused by stool in the intestines is produced due to the formation of gas, gout disorders, such as stomach cramps, diarrhea which is not clear and stomach is heavy, anek rogon ki jad, is kabj ko dur karne main 'chokar kaa prayog' vishesh sahaayak siddh hota he

 Flour Bran Required! If it is not possible at home, then outside the mill, you should grind thick flour and use it without sieving! Knead the dough and make roti after one hour, it makes the grains of bran fluffy and the bread becomes succulent, tasty, the bran softens by soaking water and going into the stomach, it upsets the stomach
 It seems obvious, if it is necessary to sieve the flour, then take the chan and separate it into the flour again after separating the garbage, aajkal kisi bhagyavan vyakti ko hi kabj ki beemaari na hogi varna har stri purush ko apach or kabj ke rogon ne gheraa he, ise log dawaao kaa seven kar kabj ko dur karte rahete he or uske aadi ho jate he ki agar daawa kaa seven na kare to pet saaf nahin hoga, na jane bazaar se videshi cholesterol, pholestrol yukt aataa, pilsbari aataa, lekin chokar yukt aataa sab baazaaroo aate kaa "pita" he, kabj ko jad se samaapt karne ke liye nimnlikhit vidhiyon ke anusaar chokar kaa seven kare ! saath main yogabhyas kaa nit abhyaas karen !

 shairan, jise kairan bhi kehate hai, boune grah yama kaa sab se bada upgrah he
 It was discovered in 1978
 2015 main pluto or shairan kaa adhyayan karne ke liye america sarkaar dwaara ek "new horaedens" naam kaa manushya-rahit antariksh yaan bhejne kii yojana he
 The Sharon is circular and has a diameter of 1,207 km, which is slightly more than half the diameter of Pluto
 uski sataha kaa kul kshetrafal lagbhag 45
8 lakh varg kilometre he
 Where there is frozen ice of nitrogen and methane on the surface of Pluto, there is water on the Sharon instead of it
 pluto par ek patala vayumandal he lekin shairan ke adhyayan se sanket mila he ke usapar koi vayumandal nahin he or uski sataha ke upar sirf khule antariksh kaa vyom he
 Sharon has fewer stones and more snow than Pluto
 shairan ko angrezi main "charon" likhaa jaataa he
 Astronomers differ among themselves as to whether there are different layers of ice and stone inside the Sharon, or that the entire satellite has the same ice and stone mixture
 pluto or shairan kaa ghanatv dekhakar andaja lagaaya jaataa he ke pluto kaa 70% dravyaman pathar he jabaki shairan kaa keval 50-55% pathar he
 This has led some scientists to think that a massive collision of some other object on Pluto caused it to collect the debris above as a satellite
 isliye shairan main pluto kii upree sataha kii barf adhik he or pluto ke andar ke pathar kam
 But this idea raises a doubt - if it had actually happened, an even larger percentage of Sharon should have been made of ice and an even larger percentage of Pluto would have been made of stone
 isliye kuch anya vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ke shairan or pluto shuru se hi alag vastuen thim jo takaraai, lekin phir alag hokar ek-dusre kii parikrama karne lagi
 The combination of Pluto and Sharon is unique in the solar system
 shairan kaa vyas pluto ke aadhe se zyaada he or uskaa dravyaman pluto kaa 11
6% he - jo saura mandal main kisi bhi upgrah-grah kii jodi main sabase adhik he
 For comparison, the diameter of the Earth's moon is about one-fourth that of the Earth and only 1
2% of the Earth's mass
 is kaaran se pluto or shairan kaa mila hua dravyaman kendra kaa bindu pluto ke andar nahin balki in donon ke bich ke khule vyom main padataa he or pluto or shairan donon is bindu kii parikrama karte hai
 If the definitions of astronomy are strictly imposed, then in such a situation, two astronomical objects are called twin planets rather than planetary satellites
 phir bhi aam taur par shairan ko pluto kaa upgrah hi mana jaataa he
