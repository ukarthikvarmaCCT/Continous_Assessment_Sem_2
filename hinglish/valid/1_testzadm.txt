 The Supreme Court of Pakistan, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is the supreme court and is the apex of the judicial system of Pakistan and is the pinnacle of the Pakistani judicial order
 pakistan kii sarvocch nyaayalay, pakistan kanoonee or sanvaidhanik maamalon main faisla karne vaali antim madhyasth bhi he
 The permanent office of the Supreme Court is located in Pakistan's capital Islamabad, while many sub-branches of this court are functioning in important cities of Pakistan where cases are heard
 sarvocch nyaayalay, pakistan ko kai sanvaidhanik va nyaayik vikalp praapt hote hai, jinaki vyakhya pakistan ke samvidhan main kii gai he
 The Supreme Court has established itself even during the tenure of several military governments and unconstitutional dictatorial governments in the country
 saath hi, is adaalat ne sainya shakti par ek vaastavik nireekshak ke rup main swayan ko sthapit kiya he or kai avasaron main sarkaron kii nigaraanee kii he
 This court has appellate authority over all high courts and federal courts
 iske alaava yah kuch prakaar ke maamalon par mul adhikaar bhi rakhata he
 The Supreme Court is made up of a Chief Justice and a set number of senior judges, who are nominated by the President after consulting the Prime Minister
 ek baar niyukt nyaayadhish ko, ek nirdisht avadhi ko puraa karne or uske baad hi ritair hone kii ummid kii jaati he, jab tak ki ve duraachaar ke kaaran sarvocch nyaayik parishad dwaara nilambit nahin kiye jate hai
 The Supreme Court of Pakistan was established by the 1956 Constitution
 isane 1948 main, aadesh dwaara sthapit, sangheey adaalat kaa navaroop tha
 Since its formation in 1956, it has retained its judicial authority and has been successful in asserting its authority even during the tenure of several Saini governments
 1956 ke samvidhan ke anusaar: ucchtam nyaayalay karanchi main sthapit thi, parantu 1949 main ise lahore main punarsthapit kar diya gaya, jahaan yah maujuuda lahore ucch nyaayalay ke bhawan main kaaryshil tha
 In the 1973 Constitution document, the Supreme Court has been set up in Islamabad and it is hoped that the Supreme Court should be established in the capital of the country
 parantu raashi ke abhaav ke kaaran nyaayalay ke bhawan ko us samay islamabad main nahin nirmit kiya ja sakaa tha
 So in 1974 the court was moved from Lahore to Rawalpindi
 1989 main, sarkaar dwaara islamabad main sarvocch nyaayalay ke nae bhawan ke nirmaan ke liye dhanrashi aavantit kii gai
 The construction of the existing building on the Constituency Avenue of Islamabad started only in 1990, but due to the lack of money, only the main building could be constructed by 1993, so further construction was stopped in 1993

 Sections 176 to 190 of the Constitution give several constitutional powers to the Supreme Court, the use of which can control and hinder the President's work independence
 udhaahranswaroop: samvidhan ke anusaar raashtrapati ke paas qaumi asembli ko bhang karne kaa adhikaar he, parantu aise kisi bhi vivaadasper bhangan ko vaiddh yaa avaiddh qaraar dene kaa adhikaar sarvocch nyaayalay ko diya gaya he
 Apart from this, the court has also been empowered to inspect any decision and order taken by the President and declare it as non-constitutional and illegal
 haalaanki ye praavdhaan samvidhan dwaara ankit kiye gaye hai, parantu inhen aamtaur par upyog nahin kiya jaataa he
 But if seen in the context of constitutional history of Pakistan, then such rights have been used on many occasions

 Politics gateway sarvocch nyaayalay, pakistan kii nyaaypalika kaa shikaar bindu he, evam pakistani nyaayik tantra kaa shreshthatam va ucchtam nyaayalay he
 Pakistan has a hierarchical system of judiciary in which there are two classes of courts: shreshthatar nyaaypalika main, ucchtam nyaayalay ke atirikt, sangheey sharia adaalat or paanch prantiy ucch nyaayalayon aate hai, jiske sheersh par supreme court virajman he
 At the lower level of the Supreme Court, there is a High Court constituted for each of the four provinces and the capital city of Islamabad
 pakistan kaa samvidhan, nyaaypalika par samvidhan kii raksha, sangrakshan va bachaav kaa daayitv saunpta he
 Neither the Supreme Court nor the High Court can exercise jurisdiction in respect of tribal areas, unless otherwise provided

 Criminal courts were created under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and civil courts were established by the West Pakistan Civil Courts Ordinance, 1964
 saath hi, rajasav adaalatein bhi hai, jo ki pashchimi pakistan bhu-rajasav adhinium, 1967 ke tahat kaam kar rahe hai
 The decisions taken by all these courts are appeal-bound
 arthath nirnay ko unchi adaalaton main chunauti di ja sakati he
 The supreme court has final jurisdiction in this
 pakistan ke mukhya nyaayadhish, pakistan kii nyaaypalika ke pramukh evam ucchtam nyaayalay ke mukhya nyaayadhish hote hai
 He is the senior-most among the 16 judges of the Supreme Court
 mukhya nyaayadhish pakistan kii nyaayik pranali ke pramukh prashasnic adhikari he evam yah pakistan kaa ucchtam nyaayalay pad he jo sangheey nyaaypalika kii niti nirdhaaran vah ucchtam nyaayalay main nyaayik kaaryon kaa karyanvayan ke liye jimmedaar he

 adaalat kii sunwaayee par adhyakshata karte hue mukhya nyaayadhish ke paas nyaayalay kii niti nirdhaaran ke liye atyant takat he
 At the same time, according to modern tradition, the Chief Justice of Pakistan was the first Chief Justice Sir Abdul Rashid
 maujuuda sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon ke anusaar sarvocch nyaayalay main mukhya nyaayadhish ke atirikt, adhiktam 16 or nyaayadhish rah sakate hai
 The Supreme Court of Pakistan consists of a Chief and 16 other appointed judges
 nyaayadhish ke rup main anubhav ke 5 saal tak yaa vakil ke rup main 15 varshon ke anubhav waal kisi vyakti ko hi sarvocch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish ke pad ke liye aavedan karne kaa adhikaar he
 The President of Pakistan appoints judges of the court from the recommendation made by the Supreme Court to individuals based on their discretion and experience in various fields of law
 supreme court kii siforishein ko raashtrapati par badhyakaari he
 Exercise: As a rule, the most senior judge of the Supreme Court is appointed as the Chief Justice
 prayek nyaayadhish 65 saal kii umr tak pad dhaaran kar sakate hai, jis bich ve jaldi hi istipha dwaara yaa samvidhan ke praavdhaanon ke anusaar pad se hataaya ja saktaa he
 That is, due to physical or mental incapacity or misconduct - the validity of which is determined by the Supreme Judicial Council - any judge can be removed only on the basis of the provisions provided by the Constitution before the term is completed

 The Soviet Union gave its full support to China
 lekin japan sena ne shanghai se china kii sena ko haraane shuru kiya or unki rajdhani bejing par kabja kar liya
 In 1938, China fenced its Yellow River and China got some time to manage but still they could not stop Japan

 Germany and Italy were becoming more powerful in Europe, and in 1938 Germany invaded Austria, yet other European countries did not oppose it
 is baat se utsahit hokar hitler ne sadetenland jo kii checkoslovakia kaa pashchimi hissaa he or jahaan german bhashaa bolne waalon kii zyada taadaat thi vahaan par hamalaa bol diya
 France and England took this lightly and asked Germany where Germany would not attack them anymore
 lekin germany ne is vaade ko nahi nibhaayaa or usne hungary se saath milakar 1939 main puure checkoslovakia par kabja kar liya
 The Danjig city, which was separated from Germany and given to Poland after the First World War, was governed by a world-class organization called the Union of Nations, which was established after the First World War
 is denging shahar par jab hitler ne kabja karne kii sochi to france or germany poland ko apni aazaadee ke liye samarthan dene ko taiyaar ho gaye
 And when Italy attacked Albania, the same support was also given to Romania and Greece

 After France and England assisted Poland, Italy and Germany also entered into a pact of steel with each other
 soviet sangh yah samaj gaya tha kii france or england ko uskaa saath pasand nahi or germany agar us par hamalaa karegaa to bhi france or england us ke saath nahi honge to usne germany ke saath milakar usapar akraman na karne kaa samjhauta par hastakshar kiye or khufia taur par poland or baaki purvi europe ko aapas main baatane kaa hi qaraar shaamil tha
 In September 1939, the Soviet Union drove Japan from its border and at the same time Germany invaded Poland
 france, england or rashtramandal deshon ne bhi germany ke khilaaf hamalaa bol diya parantu yah hamalaa bahut bade paimaane par nahi tha sirf france ne ek chota hamalaa sarland par kiya jo kii germany kaa ek rajya tha
 After the Soviet Union declared a ceasefire with Japan, itself attacked Poland
 oktober 1939 tak poland germany or soviet sangh ke bich vibhajit ho chukaa tha
 During this time, Japan attacked an important Chinese city of Changsha, but China gave them an outing
 poland par hamale ke baad soviet sangh ne apni sena ko baltic deshon kii taraf mode di
 When the Soviet Union invaded Finland in November 1939, the war, known as the Winter War, lasted four months and Finland lost some of its land and signed a Moscow peace agreement with the Soviet Union under which it Freedom will not be taken away, but the land of Finland occupied by the Soviet Union, which had 12 percent population of Finland and its second largest Everyone involved Yworg
 france or england ne soviet sangh ke finland par hamale ko dwitiya vishwa yuddh main shaamil hone kaa bahaanaa banaaya or germany ke saath mil gaye or soviet sangh ko deshon ke sangh se bahaar karne kii koshish kii
 China had an opportunity to stop the effort because it was a member of the Union of Nations
 lekin wo is prastaav main shaamil nahi hua kyonki na to wo soviet sangh se or na hi pashchimi takaton se apane aap ko dur rakhana chahta tha
 The Soviet Union was angered by this and stopped all military aid to China
 june 1940 main soviet sangh ne teenon baltic deshon par kabja kar liya

 mcdonald Template: Multiplex techniques code divijan multiple acces ek channel kaa upyog karne kii vidhi he jiskaa upyog bhinn radio sanchaar praudyogikiyon main kiya jaataa he
 This should not be confused with mobile phone standards called cdmaone and CDMA2000, which use CDMA as an embedded channel access method
 data sanchaar main ek mul avadharana he, bhinn transmitors ko ek saath ek hi sanchaar channel par jaankaree bhejne kii anumati dene kaa vichaar
 yah kai upyogkartaaon ko vibhinn aavritiyon ke ek bandwidth ko share karne kii anumati detaa he
 This concept is called multiplexing
 CDMA sprad-spectrum takanic or ek vishesh koding yojana uplabdh karaata he jo kai upyogkartaaon ko saamaan bhautik channel par bahusanketan kii anumati detaa he
 In contrast, time division divides multiple access access by time, while frequency-division multiple access divides it by frequency
 CDMA "sprad-spectrum" signling kaa ek rup he, chunki modulated coded signal ke paas sancharit ho rahe data kii tulana main adhik ucch data bandwidth hota he
 a form of multiple access problem is a room in which people want to interact with each other
 bhram se bachane ke liye, log bolte samay apni baat main mode le sakate hai, bhinn pichon par bol sakate hai, yaa bhinn bhashaaon main bol sakate hai 
CDMA pichley udhaaharan ke anuroop he, jahaan samaan bhashaa bolne vaale log ek duusare ko samaj sakate hai, lekin duusare logon ko nahin
 isi prakaar, radio CDMA main, upyogkartaaon ke prayek samooh ko ek share kiya gaya gaya code diya jaataa he
 Many codes are on the same channel, but only users associated with a particular code can understand each other
 CDMA ek sprad spectrum multiple acces takanic he
 a spread spectrum technique is a technique that evenly spreads the bandwidth of data for the same power transmitted
 sprad hone vaala code ek kuta-yadrichhik code he jisamen anya sankare pulse code ke vipareet ek sankara aspasht function hota he
 a locally generated code operates at a much faster rate than the data being transmitted in CDMA
 sancharan ke liye data saadhaaran rup se taarkik rup se XOR hota he jo teevr code ke saath judaa hota he
 The figure shows how the spread spectrum signal is produced
 t b { \ displaystyle T_{b}} kii pulse avadhi se yukt data signal XOR he jo t c { \ displaystyle T_{c}} kii pulse avadhi se yukt code signal ke saath sanyojit hota he
 Therefore, the bandwidth of the data signal is 1 / t b { \ displaystyle 1 / T_ {b}} and the bandwidth of the spread spectrum signal is 1 / t c { \ displaystyle 1 / T_ {c}}
 chunki t c { \ displaystyle T_{c}}, t b { \ displaystyle T_{b}} kii tulana main bahut chota he, sprad spetrum signal kii bandwidth mul signal kii bandwidth se bahut badi he
 The ratio t b / t c { \ displaystyle T_ {b} / T_ {c}} is called a spreading factor or processing gain and determines the level of the higher limit of the total number of users automatically supported by a base station
 ek CDMA signal kaa utpaadan In the CDMA system, each user uses a different code to modulate their signals
 signal ko modulate karne ke liye prayukt code kaa chayan, CDMA system ke pradarshan main bahut mahatvapurn he
 The best performance would be when there is a good separation between a desired user's signal and another user's signal
 Segregation of the signals is done by correlating the received signal with the locally generated code of the desired user
 yadi signal vaanchit upyogkarta ke code ke saath match ho jaataa he, to sambandh kaa function ucch hoga or system signal ko nishkarshith kar saktaa he
 If the desired user's code has nothing in common with the signal, the relationship should be as close to zero as possible; This is called cross relationship
 yadi code shunya ke alaava kisi samay ofaset ke signal ke sambandhit he, to jahaan tak ho sake sambandh shunya ke najadik hona chahie
 yah swatah-sambandh kehalaata he or iskaa upyog bahu-path nishkarsh ko asweekrut karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 In general, CDMA belongs to two basic categories: synchronous) and asynchronous)
 tulykaalik CDMA data shrinkhalaaon kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale wechters ke bich orthogonality ke ganitiya gunon kaa upyog karata he
 For example, the binary series "1011" is expressed by a vector
 sadishon ko unka bindu gunanfal lekar guna kiya ja saktaa he, iske liye unke sambandhit ghatakon ke gunanfal kaa yoga kiya jaataa he
 If the point product is zero, the two vector are called orthogonal to each other and v =, the point product u · v = a * c + b * d)
 Some properties of the point product help to understand how W-CDMA works
 yadi sadish a or b orthogonal hai, to In synchronous CDMA, each user uses a code that is orthogonal to another code to modulate its signals
 chaar aapas main orthogonal digital signlon kaa ek udhaaharan chitra main darshaya gaya he
 Orthogonal codes have a cross relation, which is equal to zero; In other words, they do not interfere with each other
 IS-95 64 bit ke maamle main, bhinn upyogkartaaon ko alag karne ke liye signal ko encode karne ke liye walsh kods kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Since each of the 64 Walsh codes are orthogonal to each other, the signals are channelized into 64 orthogonal signals
 nimnlikhit udhaaharan darshata he ki kaise prayek upyogkarta signal ko encode yaa dicode kiya ja saktaa he
 Start with a set of vacators that are orthogonal to each other
 or or jis data ko upyogkarta sancharit karnaa chahta he, vah he, yah se sambandhit hoga, jise iske baad binary main, ,, ) ke rup main nirmit kiya jayega
 For the purposes of this paragraph, we call this constructed vectors transmitted vectors
 prayek preshak ke paas ek alag, adwitiya vactor v hota he, jise samucchy se chunaa gaya hota he, lekin sancharit vactor ke nirmaan kii vidhi samaan hoti he
 Now, due to the physical properties of interference, two signals at the same point are in the same phase, they sum to give twice the amplitude of each signal, but if they are out of phase, they "decrease" and one Give signals that differ by amplitude
 digital rup se, is vyavhaar ko ghatak dar ghatak, sancharan vaikatars ke yoga ke dwaara model kiya ja saktaa he
 If sender is code and data of 0 and sender is code and data of 1 and both senders transmit simultaneously, then this table shows the terms of the coding: kyonki signal0 or signal1 ek hi samay main hawa main sancharit kiye jate hai, ve kaccha signal dene ke liye yoga karte hai: + = This is called the raw signal interference model
 iske baad praptakarta hastkshep praturup ke saath preshak ke code ke sangyojan ke dwaara kisi gyaat preshak ke liye ek signal ko nishkarshith karata he
 The following table explains how it functions and shows that the signals do not interfere with each other
 iske alaava, dicoden ke baad, 0 se bade sabhi maanon ko 1 mana jaataa he, jabaki shunya se neeche ke sabhi maanon ko 0 mana jaataa he
 For example, after decoden, the data is 0, but the recipient considers it
 ham yah bhi vichaar kar sakate hai, ki yadi ek praptakarta ek signal ko dicode karne kii koshish karata he, jab upyogkarta ne koi jaankaree nahin bheji he, to kya hoga
 mana ki signal0 = ko akele preshit kiya jaataa he
 The following table shows the decode on the recipient
 jab praptakarta preshak1 ke code kaa upyog karte hue signal ko dicode karne kaa prayaas karata he, data purnataya shunya he, isliye kros sambandh shunya ke baraabar he or yah spasht he ki preshak1 ne koi data nahin bheja he
 The former example of an orthogonal Walsh sequence describes how 2 users are multiplexed with each other in a synchronous system, a technique commonly called code division multiplexing
 chitra main darshaae gaye 4 walsh anukramon kaa samucchy 4 tak upyogkartaaon ko rakhega or saamaanya rup main, ek nxn walsh metrics kaa upyog multiplex n upyogkartaaon ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Multiplexing requires that all users be coordinated so that each transmits a given sequence v to them, so that they reach the recipient at exactly the same time
 Thus, this technique finds use in a base-to-mobile relationship, where all transmissions originate from the same transmitter and can be fully integrated
 duusari ore, mobile-se-aadhaar link ko purnataya samanvit nahin kiya ja saktaa he, vishesh rup se handset kii gatishiltaa ke kaaran or ise kisi anya drushtikon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Since it is not possible to mathematically construct signature sequences that are orthogonal to the random starting point, unique "pseudorandom" or "pseudo-sound" sequences are used in asynchronous CDMA systems
 ek PN code ek binary anukram he jo yadrichhik prathit hota he lekin ise niyat praptakarta ke dwaara ek nirdhaarit tareeke main punah utpaadit kiya ja saktaa he
 These PN codes are used to encode and decode a user signal in asynchronous CDMA in the same way as orthogonal codes in synchronous CDMA
 These PN sequences are not statistically correlated and the sum of a large number of PN sequences causes multiple access interference, which are estimated by a Gaussian noise process
 If all users achieve the same power capacity, the variance of the MAI increases in direct proportion of users
 duusare shabdon main, tulykaalik CDMA ke vipareet, anya upyogkartaaon ke signal hit ke signal ke shor ke rup main prakat hote hai or upyogkartaaon kii sankhya ke anupaat main vaanchit signal ke saath hastkshep karte hai
 All forms of CDMA use the spread spectrum process advantage to help the receiver partially discriminate against unwanted signals
 nirdisht PN anukram ke saath enkodit kiye gaye signal praapt kiye jate hai, jabaki bhinn kods se yukt signal prakriy laabh ke dwaara kam kii gayi wideband dhwani ke rup main prakat hote hai
 Since each user generates MAI, controlling signal strength is an important issue with CDMA transmitters
 ek CDM, TDMA yaa FDMA praptakarta saidhantik rup se bhinn kods, samay slots, yaa aavruti channel kaa prayog karte hue yadrichhik prabal signlon ko puri tarah se asweekrut kar detaa he
 The reason for this is the orthogonality of these systems
 yah atulykaalik CDMA ke liye sach nahin he; avaanchit signal kii asweekruti keval aanshik hoti he
 If any or all of the unwanted signals are stronger than the desired signal, they will be effective
 isiilie yah kisi bhi atulykaalik CDMA system main saamaanya aavashyaktaa he ki bhinn signal power staron kaa lagbhag milan kiya jaye
cdma cellular main, prayek mobile kii sancharan kshamta ko sakhti se niyantrit karne ke liye base stesan ek teevr band-loop power niyantran yojana kaa prayog karata he
 For further information on this problem, see Nearby problem

 nishchit aavruti spectrum kaa prabhavi praayogic upyog
 The main advantage of asynchronous CDMA over CDM, TDMA and FDMA is that it uses spectrum more effectively in mobile telephony applications
 siddhant main, CDMA, TDMA or FDMA kii samaan spectral kushalta hoti he, lekin praayogic rup se har kisi kii apni chunautiyaan hai- CDMA main maamle main kshamta niyantran, TDMA ke maamle main samay or FDMA ke maamle main aavruti utpaadan / filter
 TDMA systems have to carefully synchronize the transmission time of all users to ensure that they are received in the correct time period and do not cause any interference
 chunki ise ek mobile vaataavaran main puri tarah se niyantrit nahin kiya ja saktaa he, prayek samay slot main ek guard-samay hona chahie, jo upyogkartaaon ke hastkshep kii sambhaavna ko kam kar detaa he, lekin spectrum kii kushalta yaa prabhavita ko kam kar detaa he
 Similarly, FDMA systems must use a guard-band between the forward channels, the reason being the unpredictable Doppler shift of the signal spectrum that arises due to the mobility of the user
 guard-band agragami channel ke hastkshep kii sambhaavna ko kam karegaa, lekin spectrum kii upyogita ko kam karegaa
 2
 Flexible allocation of resources atulykaalik CDMA sansadhano ke lacheele aavanton main ek mukhya laabh prastut karata he, yani sakriy upyogkartaaon ke liye ek PN code kaa aavanton
 In the case of CDM, TDMA and FDMA the number of simultaneous orthogonal codes, time slots, and frequency slots, becomes sequentially stable, so the capacity is limited in terms of the number of users at the same time
 orthogonal code, samay slots yaa aavriti band kii sankhya sthir hoti he, jise CDM, TDMA or FDMA systamon ke liye aavantit kiya jaataa he, yah telephoni kii barsti pravriti or packet band data sancharan ke kaaran aderoutikrut rah jaataa he
 There is no strict limit to the number of users that can be supported in an asynchronous CDMA system, with only one experimental limit governed by the missing bit error probability, since sirs vary greatly by number of users
 ek barsti treffic vaataavaran jaise telephoni main atulykaalik CDMA kaa laabh yah he ki The display is allowed to fluctuate at random, with the average value being determined by the number of times the user is served and the percentage of usability
 maan lijie 2N upyogkarta hai jo keval aadhe samay ke liye baat karte hai, to 2N upyogkartaaon ko samaan ausat bit truti sambhaavna ke saath rakhaa ja saktaa he, jab n upyogkarta puure samay baat karte hai
 The main difference here is that the bit error probability of n users talking all the time is constant, whereas it is a random quantity
 aadhe samay ke liye baat karne vaale 2N upyogkartaaon ke liye
 In other words, asynchronous CDMA is ideally suited for a mobile network, where each of a large number of transmitters generates a relatively small amount of traffic at irregular intervals
 CDM, TDMA or FDMA system barsti treffic ke kaaran aderoutikrut sansadhano ko punah praapt nahin kar sakate, kyonki orthogonal kods, samay slots or aavruti channelon kii sankhya sthir hoti he, jise ek vyaktigat transmeter ko diya ja saktaa he
 For example, if a TDMA system has n time slots and 2N users who talk for half the time, then more than n users will need more than n time slots for half the time
 In addition, it will require significant overhead for orthogonal code, time slot and continuous allocation or de-allocation of frequency channel resources
 yah meh tulana karne par, atulykaalik CDMA transmeter saadhaaran rup se preshan karte hai jab jab unke paas kuch kehane ke liye hota he or hawa main bhejne ke liye hota he, is ke dauraan jab tak ve system se jude rahete hai, samaan PN hastakshar anukram ko banaaye rakhte hai

 Protection of privacy in spread spectrum CDMA due to rail sequence capabilities of PN sequence
 adhikansh modulan yojanayen signal ke bandwidth ko kam karne kii koshish karti hai kyonki bandwidth ek simit strot he
 However, the spread spectrum technique uses a transmission bandwidth, that is, different order of amplitude exceeds the minimum required signal bandwidth
 ise karne kaa ek praarambhik kaaran tha maargdarshan or sanchaar pranaaliyon se yukt sainya anuprayog
 These systems were designed using spread spectrum due to its safety and resistance to jamming
 atulykaalik CDMA ke paas gopneeyata kaa kuch nirmit str hota he kyonki signal ek kuta-yadrichhik code kaa upyog karte hue failata he; is code ke kaaran sprad spectrum signal yadrichhik rup se prakat hote hai yaa unamem dhwani jaise gun hote hai
 a recipient cannot demodulate this transmission without the knowledge used to encode the data
 CDMA jeming ke liye bhi pratirodhi he
 a jamming signal only has a finite range of available capacity to jam the signal
 jaamar yaa to signal kii puri bandwidth main isaki urja ko failaata he yaa puure signal ke kisi bhaag ko jam kar detaa he
 CDMA can effectively negate narrow band interference
 chunki sankare band kaa hastkshep keval sprad spectrum signal ke ek chote bhaag ko prabhavit karata he, ise jaankaree kii adhik kshati ke bina noch filtering ke dwaara aasaani se hataaya ja saktaa he
 Convolution encoding and interleaving can be used to help retrieve lost data
 CDMA signal bahupathiy feding ko bhi rokte hai
 Since the spread spectrum signal has a large bandwidth, only a small part of it passes through the fading due to the multipath at a given time
 sankareband hastkshep kii tarah iske parinamswaroop data kii bahut kam kshati hogi or ise punah praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Another reason CDMA is resistant to multipath interference is because a delayed version of the transmitted code-random code would have weaker connections to the original code-random code and would thus appear to the other user, which would be passed on to the recipient Is neglected
 duusare shabdon main, jab tak bahupathiy channel kam se kam deree kii ek chip ko prerit karata he, bahupathiy signal praptakarta par pahunch jate hai taaki ve nirdhaarit signal se kam se kam ek chip ke dwaara samay main shift ho jate hai
 The correlation properties of the code-random code are such that it causes some delay in the appearance of a multipath unrelated to the fixed signal and thus gets neglected
 kuch CDMA upkaran ek rek praptakarta kaa upyog karte hai, jo system ke pradarshak ko sudhaarney ke liye bahupathiy deree ghatak kaa upyog karata he
 a rake receiver combines information received from multiple connections, each with a different path delay and twisted and generating a stronger version of the signal than an ordinary receiver with a path delay of the dominant signal and a singular connector
 , aavriti punah prayog, ek cellular system ke bheetar anya cell cites par samaan radio channel aavruti ke punah upyog kii kshamta he
 Frequency planning is an important consideration in FDMA and TDMA systems
 vibhinn cell main prayukt aavritiyon ko saavdhaneepurvak niojit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, taaki yah sunishchit kiya ja sake ki bhinn cell se praapt signal ek duusare ke saath hastkshep naa karen
 ek CDMA pranali main samaan aavruti kaa upyog prayek koshika main kiya jaataa he kyonki channleekaran ko kuta-yadrichhik kods kaa upyog karte hue kiya jaataa he
 Reusing the same frequency in every cell eliminates the need for frequency planning in a CDMA system; However, different pseudorandom sequences must be employed to ensure that the signal received from one cell does not correspond to the signal received from a nearby cell
 chunki paas ke cell samaan aavritiyon kaa upyog karte hai, CDMA pranali ke paas soft hendoophs ke pradarshan kii kshamta hoti he
 Soft handoffs allow simultaneous communication with two or more cells
 sarvottam signal gunvattta kaa chayan kiya jaataa he jab tak handoph puraa na ho
 yah anya cellular pranaaliyon main prayukt hard handoph se bhinn he
 In a hard handoff situation, when the mobile telephone turns to a handoff, the signal strength suddenly changes
 iske vipareet, CDMA system soft handoph kaa upyog karata he, jiskaa pataa nahin lagaaya ja saktaa he or yah adhik vishwasaneey ore ucch gunvattta ke signal uplabdh karata he

 The writing of the script was inspired by Paul Schrader Arthur Bremer's diaries and Dostoevsky's Notes from the Underground
 haalanki lekhak ne swayan ko bhi ek prerana ke rup main liya tha
 Prior to writing the script, Shredder was largely a bickle-like figure and isolated
 talaak or ek liv-in premika se saath rishta tut jane ke baad, unhone kai hafte apni car main bithaye

 a review of the film by film critic Stephen Hunter suggested that Bickel was a Vietnam War soldier
 hunter is baat kii or dhyaan dilaate hai ki kis prakaar paatr kii military poshaak or aagneyastron ke aas-paas rahane kii pratikraya ek yuddh kaa sainik hone ke liye anupyukt lagata he
 Hunter's second theory is that Bickel would likely be a lonely man who developed a soldier's personality as part of a multitude of his personal / psychological problems
 film ke ek shuruaati drishy main bikal cab company personal officer ko bataata he ki use marains se sammanpurvak sevamukt kiya gaya tha, haalanki drishy main koi pratyaksh dastaveji vivaran yaa screenple main us jagah kaa koi spashtikaran nahin diya gaya tha
 However, in the opening character introduction, Schrader writes that Bickle "wears a character seed army jacket with" King Kong Company 1968-70 "as a patch, while the date is de-signed to give Bickle just an identity
 Might be possible
 haalanki, ek saakshaatkaar main shreder ne yah pushti kii thi ki unhone bikal ko ek vietnami sainik banane kaa faisla isliye kiya tha kyonki yuddh ke kaaran hui rashtriya durdasha bikal kii peedaadaayak manah sthiti se puri tarah mail khaati thi jisase uske anubhav yuddh ke baad adhik teevr or daraavne ho gaye the
 That is why Bickle drives his taxi somewhere else in the city to vent his hatred

 Is this a fantasy scene? Can Travis survive the shoot out? Are we feeling his dying thoughts? Can this sequence be accepted as a truth? 


 i don't know that the answer to these questions can be found

 Their task is to return India to the Vedas
 ve ishwar ke advait tathaa ajanma satta ko swikarkar krishnadi ke ishwartv ko na maanate hue unhen mahapurush kii sangya dete hai tathaa puranic tathyon ko purnataya nakaarte hai
 However, in the era of Maharishi Dayanand ji, the principles propounded by him, such as the Puranas, are imaginary and unholy, have been refuted
 atah yahan se aaryon ke mat kaa do bhaag ho gaya
 One who believes in both the Puranas and the Vedas and the true form of God, and those who believe only the Vedas and the formless entity

 In the sense of respectable, Arya has been used a lot in Sanskrit literature
 patni pati ko aryaputra kahati thi
 It is customary to call Pitamah as Arya and Pitamahi as Arya
 naitik rup se prakrut aacharan karanevaale ko arya kaha gaya he : Initially "arya" may have been used in the sense of species or varna, later on in Indian history its moral meaning became more prevalent according to which a person of any varna or caste came to be called Arya due to his superiority or gentleness
 
 arya prajati kii adibhumi ke sambandh main abhi tak vidwaanon main bahut matbhed hai
 At the beginning of linguistic studies, the theory of acoustics was often presented as an integral part of language and species, and it was believed that ancestors of speakers of European languages lived in the same place and migrated to different countries
 bhashavaigyanik saakshyon kii apurnataa or anischitata ke kaaran yah adibhumi kabhi madhya asia, kabhi pamir-kashmir, rahi he
 Whereas the Aryan traces left outside India are sometimes found in the grasslands of austria-hungary, sometimes Germany, sometimes sweden-norway and today in South Russia
 bhashaa or prajati anivaary rup se abhinn nahin
 Today, the principle of multiplicity of various branches of Aryans is also becoming prevalent, according to which it is not necessary that all the castes of arya-bhasha-family were of the same anthropomorphism
 bhashaa kaa grahan to sampark or prabhaav se bhi hota aayaa he, kai jatiyon ne to apni mul bhashaa chhodkar vijaateey bhashaa ko purnat: apana liya he
 As far as the origin of Indian Aryans is concerned, there is not a single mention in Indian literature regarding their coming from outside
 kuch logon ne parampara or anushruti ke anusaar madhyadesh tathaa cajungal or himalay tathaa vindhyas ke bich kaa pradesh athwa aryaavart hi aaryon kii adibhumi mana he
 Some scholars have considered Saptasindhu to be the Adi Bhoomi of the Aryans, based only on the Rig Veda, separated from the mythological tradition
 lokmaanya bal gangadhar tilak ne rugveda main varnit deergh ahoratr, pralambit ushaa aadi ke aadhaar par aaryon kii moolbhoomi ko dhruvapradesh main mana tha
 Many European scholars and their followers Indian scholars still consider Indian Aryans as coming from outside
 ab aaryon ke bharat ke baahar se aane kaa siddhanth galat siddh kar diya gaya he
 It is believed that by rendering this theory, the British and Europeans wanted to instill in the Indians the feeling that the Indian people were already slaves
 iske atirikt angrej iske dwaara uttar bharatiyon tathaa dakshin bharatiyon main foot daalana chaahate the
 In this series, the British have told the Shudras to bring their troops from South Africa for their personal service and tact and to fight the Aryans in India! Whereas in reality the Shudras were those people who lived in unprotected state like uneducated and animals in the forests! arya log jagat kii sanathan sthapana ke jaanakar the
 According to him, for the development of love power, omnipresent Narayana or God is real-movable human-animal-insect-kite-monk-sinner, enemy-friend and god and asuras are appearing
 aravind ghosh ke anusaar arya log mitra ki raksha or shatru kaa naash karte the kintu isamen unako aasakti nahin thi
 Everywhere, in all beings, in all things, in deeds, and in seeing God in the fruit, the favored-evil enemy-friend believed in happiness, sorrow and accomplishment-imperfection
 is sambhaav kaa parinaam yah nahin tha ki sab kuch unke liye sukhadaayi or sab karm unke karne yogya the
 Without complete yoga, the duality does not disappear, and very few people get this stage, but Arya education is the property of ordinary Aryans
 The Aryans were conscious of removing the favored means and evil, but were not crushed by the favored means of victory and were not afraid of evil
 mitra ki sahaayta or shatru ki paraajay unki cheshtaa hoti thi lekin ve shatru se dwesh nahin karte the or mitra kaa anyaay bhi sahan nahin karte the
 The Aryans used to kill their own people with the request of duty and also fought for the life of the opposition
 ve paap ko hataane vaale or punya kaa sanchay karne vaale the lekin punya karm main garvit nahin hote the or paap main patit hone par rote nahin the varan sharir kii shuddhi karke atmonnati main sachesht ho jate the
 The Aryans used to make a lot of efforts for the accomplishment of karma and did not desist from failing thousands of times and it was unrighteousness for them to be unhappy
 arya akraman kaa siddhant apane arambhik dinon se hi lagaataar parivartit hote rahaa he
 The theory of Arya-invasion that according to the latest hypothesis, it was not a particular caste but was only a respectable word that was synonymous with the SIR of Anglabhasha
 aaryo ke akraman kii kalpan ke samarthan ke sabhi tathy bhramak siddh ho chuke he

 Sandhya was the psyche daughter of Brahma who became the wife of Maharishi Vasistha in the next life as Arundhati on the strength of penance
 vah tapasya karne ke liye chandrabhag parvat ke brihallohit naamak sarovar ke paas sadguru kii khoj main gum rahi thi
 Seeing the curiosity of Sandhya, Maharishi Vasistha appeared there and asked Sandhya - Kalyani! How are you wandering in this deep forest, whose girl are you and what do you want to do? The evening started saying - God! i have come to this deserted forest to do penance
 ab tak main bahut udvigan ho rahi thi ki kaise tapasya karuun, mujhe tapasya maarg maaloom nahin he
 But now i am very happy to see you
 vasishtha ji ne kaha- tum ekmaatr param jyothiswaroop, dharm, arth, kaam evam moksh ke daata bhagwaan vishnu kii aradhana karke hi apana abhisht praapt kar sakati ho
 In the Suryamandal, by praying the shankha-chakra-gadadhari Vanamali, Lord Vishnu, "namo Vasudevaya", chant this mantra and do penance in silence
 pehle chha: din tak kuch bhi bhojan mat karnaa, keval tisare din raatri main evam chathe din raatri main kuch pattey khaakar jal pi lenaa
 After that, fasting anhydrous for three days and then do not drink water even at night
 bhagwaan tum par prasann honge or sheeghra hi tumhaari abhilaashaa purna karenge
 In this way, by teaching, Maharishi Vasistha became imprisoned and she too began to worship God with great joy knowing the method of penance
 is prakaar baraabar chaar yug tak uski tapasya chalati rahi
 Lord Vishnu appeared in front of his eyes in the form of his spirit
 garudapar savaar apane prabhu kii manohar chhavi dekhakar vah sambhram ke saath uth khadi hui or kya kahoon? kya karuun? is chintaa main pads gayi
 Knowing his desire to praise God, he gave him divine knowledge, divine vision and divine voice
 ab vah bhagwaan kii stuti karne lagi
 While praising she fell at the feet of God
 bhagwaan ko bady dayaa aayi or unhone amritvarshini drushti se use hrisht-pusht kar diya tathaa var maangane ko kaha
 Sandhya said- Lord! If you are happy with me, then please give the first boon that no work disorder arises in the mind of a creature as soon as it is born in the world, the second boon that my virtue should be unbroken and third is that of my godly husband i do not have poor vision anywhere else
 jo purush mujhe sakaam drushti se dekhe vah purushatvheen arthath napunsak ho jaye
 God said that there are four stages - child, virginity, youth and old age
 inamen teesri avasthaa athwa duusari avasthaa ke ant main logon main kaam utpann hoga
 Today by the effect of your austerity, i have made it modest that no creature will be useful as soon as it is born
 triloki main tumhaare satitv kii khyaati hogi ar tumhaare pati ke atirikt jo bhi tumhen sakaam drushti se dekhegaa vah turant napunsak ho jaayga
 Your husband will be very fortunate, ascetic, beautiful, and seven Kalpatakas will live with you
 tumne mujhase jo var maange the ve de diye
 Now i will tell you what is on your mind
 tumne pehle aag main jalakar sharir tyaag karne kii pratigya kii thi so yaheen chandrabhaga nadi ke kinare maharishi medhatithi baarah varsh kaa yajna kar rahe hai, usee main jaakar sheeghra hi apni pratigya puri karo, vahaan aise vesh se jaao ki munilog tumhen dekh na saken
 By my grace you will become the daughter of Agindev
 jise tum pati bananaa chaahati ho, man se uskaa chintan karte-karte apana sharir tyaag karo
 Saying this, God touched Sandya's body with her hands and immediately her body became priest
 iske baad sandhyaa adrishy hokar us yagyamandap main gayi
 At the time, by the grace of God, he had in his mind the preacher of idolized celibacy and penance as a husband, and while contemplating them, he dedicated his priestly body to Agindev
 agindev ne bhagwaan kii ajna se uske sharir ko jalaakar suryamandal main pravisht kar diya
 Surya parted his body and installed it on his chariot to the delight of the gods and fathers
 uske sharir kaa upree bhaag jo din kaa prarambh yani praat:kaal he, uskaa naam praat:sandhyaa or sheshbhag din kaa ant saayam sandhyaa hua or bhagwaan ne uske praan ko divya sharir or ant:karan ko shariri banaakar medhatithi ke yagyeey agin main sthapit kar diya
 After this, at the end of the yagya Medhatithi received a beautiful evening like a gold as a daughter
 us samay yagyeey arghyajal main snaan karakar vatsalya sneh se paripurna or anandit hokar use god main uthaa liya or uskaa naam arundhati rakhaa
 Arundhati grew up in an ashram called Tapasaranya, situated on the Chandrabhaga coast
 paanchaven varsh main padaarpan karne par hi uske sadgunon se sampoorn tapasarany pavitra ho gaya
 One day Arundhati was playing near her father Medhatithi after bathing in the water of Chandrabhaga, Brahma himself came and told his father that now the time has come to teach Arundhati, so keep it with Sati Sadhvi women and get education Want Because girls should not be taught by men
 stri hi striyon ko shiksha de sakati he; kintu tumhaare paas to koi stri nahin he, atev tum apni kanya ko bahula or savitri ke paas rakh do
 Your daughter will soon become a great queen by staying with them
 medhatithi ne unki ajna shirodharya kii or unke jane par arundhati ko lekar suryalok main gayi
 There he saw Padmasnasin Savitridevi situated in Suryamandal
 us samay bahula maanas parvat par ja rahi thi, isaliye savitridevi bhi suryamandal se nikalakar vahiin ke liye chal paddy
 The thing was that everyday Savitri, Gayatri, Bahula, Saraswati and Drupada gathered together and used to conduct religion and pray for public welfare
 maharishi medhatithi ne un maataaon ko pruthak-pruthak pranaam kiya or sabko sambodhan karke kaha ki yah meri yashaswini kanya he
 This is the time for its teaching
 isi se main ise lekar yahan aayaa hoon
 Brahma has given such a command
 ab yah aapke paas hi rahegi
 Mata Savitri and Bahula both of you should teach it such that it is true
 un donon ne kaha- maharshe! bhagwaan vishnu kii krupa se tumhaari kanya pehle se hi sachharitra ho chuki he; kintu brahma kii ajna ke kaaran ham ise apane paas rakh leti hai
 She was the daughter of Brahma in the previous birth
 tumhaare tapobal se or bhagwaan kii krupa se yah tumhaari putree hui he
 Arundhati sometimes went to Savitri's house with Savitri and sometimes went to Indra's house with Bahula
 stridharm kii shiksha praapt karke vah apni shikshika savitri or bahula se bhi shreshth ho gayi
 One day while wandering on the Manas mountain, Arundhati idolized Brahmacharya saw Maharishi Vasistha
 unke mukhmandal se prakaash kii kirane nikal rahi thim
 Arundhati became infatuated with this form
 jaganmata savitri ko is baat kaa pataa laga
 After this Medhatithi requested Maharishi Vasistha to accept this girl as his wife
 vivaah ke avasar par brahma, vishnu aadi ke dwaara snaan karaate samay jo jaldharaayen giri thim, vahi gomti, sarayu, sipra, mahanadi aadi saat nadiyon ke rup main ho gayin, jinke darshan, sparsh, snaan or paan se saare sansar kaa kalyaan hota he
 After the marriage, Vasisthaji went on the plane with her husband to the said place of the gods
 ve jab jahaan jis rup main rahakar tapasya karte hue sansar ke kalyaan main sanlagan rahete hai, tab tahaan unheen ke anuroop vesh main rahakar arundhati unki seva kiya karti hai

 He is seen as the last Prophet of Allah in all the main branches of Islam
 Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam united the Arab State on the basis of al-quran, Sunnah and Hadiths on political and religious lines
 The central religious book of Islam, "al-qur'an", was narrated by Allah, the angel Jibril to Hazrat Muhammad from 610 to 632, which was written for the first time after the death of Hazrat
 Muslims often refer to Muhammad as Prophet Muhammad, or just Prophet
 Rasool refers to Allah, And consider him the best of all prophets
