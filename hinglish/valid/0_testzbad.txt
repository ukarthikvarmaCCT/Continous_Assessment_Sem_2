 The combination of good and errors, as seen everywhere in real life, was beyond the imagination of the storytellers of the time
 upanyaas main pehali baar maanav charitra ke yatharth, vishad evam gahan adhyayan kii sambhaavna dekhne ko mili
 The great English novelist Henry Fielding called his creations a satirical epic written in prose
 unhone upanyaas kii itihaas se tulana karte hue use apekshaakrit adhik mahatvapurn kaha
 Where history is limited to a few specific individuals and important events, novels have the true, eternal and ecological significance of the exhibited life
 sahitya main aaj upanyaas kaa vastut: vahi sthaan he jo pracheen yug main mahakavyon kaa tha
 In terms of broader social depiction, the two have substantial synergy
 lekin jahaan mahakavyon main jivan tathaa vyaktiyon kaa adarshavaadi chitra miltaa he, upanyaas, jaisaa filding kii paribhaasha se spasht he, samaaj kii aalochanatmak vyakhya prastut karata he
 For the novelist, the story is merely a means, not a provable one
 uskaa dhyey pathakon kaa manoranjan maatr bhi nahin
 He is the historian of his era in the true sense, who provides a tableau of the wider social life by using both truth and imagination
 upanyaas ke samanaantar idhar upanyasika naamak naveen gadhy vidha kaa sutarapaat hua he jise laghu upanyaas bhi kaha jaataa he
 From the point of view of the novel, the novel is closer to the story due to the shape and size of the novel
 isamen na to kehani jaisi ekasutrata, saghan bunaavat or prabhavanviti hoti he or na hi upanyaas jaisaa failaav tathaa nirupan vaividhya
 If seen, the novel is the genre between the novel and the story
 banbhatta kii kadambari ko vishwa kaa pratham upanyaas mana ja saktaa he
 Some people consider the novel named "genji's Story" written in 1007 AD in Japanese language as the world's first novel
 ise murasaki shikibu naamak ek mahila ne likhaa tha
 It has 54 chapters and about 1000 pages
 isamen prem or vivek kii khoj main nikle ek rajkumaar kii kahani he
 Europe's first novel is believed to be Cervantes' "don Quixote", a Spanish-language novel
 ise 1605 main likhaa gaya tha
 There are many contenders for being the first English novel
 bahut se vidwaan 1678 main jone bunyaan dwaara likhe gaye “da pilgrims progress” ko pehla angreji upanyaas maanate hai
 According to Acharya Ramchandra Shukla, Examination is the first novel of Guru Hindi
 iske lekhaklala shrinivas das hai
 'story of Devra ni Jethani'
 shraddharam fillori kii bhagyawati ko bhi hindi ke pratham upanyaas hone kaa shrey diya jaataa he
 Indulekha - Creation period, 1889, author Chandu Menon pratap mudaliyaar - rachanakaal 1879, lekhak, mayuram vednaigam pillai Durgeshanandini - Rachnakala, 1865, author, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee yamuna paryaton - rachanakaal, 1857, lekhak, baba padmaji
 It is considered the first novel written in Indian languages
 is tarah ham dekh sakate hai ki bharat kii lagbhag sabhi bhashaaon main upanyaas vidha kaa udbhav lagbhag ek hi samay das-bees varshon ke antaraal main hua
 1077 is a simple year of Gregory calendar
 arthshaastra saamaajik vigyaan kii vah shakha he, jiske antargat vastuon or sevaaon ke utpaadan, vitaran, vinimay or upbhog kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The word 'arthashastra' is derived from the Sanskrit words meaning and treaty of scripture, which literally means 'study of wealth'
 kisi vishay ke sambandh main manushyon ke kaaryo ke krambaddh gyaan ko us vishay kaa shaastra kehete hai, isliye arthshaastra main manushyon ke arthsambandhi kaayon kaa krambaddh gyaan hona aavashyak he
 Economics is also used to understand how the economy works and how the economic relationship of different sections in the society is
 arthshaastreey vivechna kaa prayog samaaj se sambandhit vibhinn kshetron main kiya jaataa he, jaise:- aparaadh, shiksha, parivaar, swasthya, kanoon, raajnneeti, dharm, saamaajik santhaan or yuddh ityadi
 Pro
 According to Samuelsson, british arthshaastri alfred marshall ne is vishay ko paribhaashit karte hue ise ‘manushya jati ke rosemara ke jivan kaa adhyayan’ bataaya he
 Marshall had found that whatever is happening in society, economic powers are behind it
 isiilie saamaj ko samajhane or ise behatar banane ke liye hamen iske arthik aadhaar ko samajhane kii jarurat he
 According to Lionel Robinson the definition of modern economics is as follows- durlabhta kaa arth he ki uplabdh sansaadhan sabhi maangon or zaruraton ko puraa karne main asamarth hai
 Economics is of relevance due to rarity and alternative uses of resources
 atev yah vishay prerakon or sansadhano ke prabhaav main vikalp kaa adhyayan karata he
 In economics, it is natural for economic matters to be predominant
 parantu hamako yah na bhul janaa chahie ki gyaan kaa uddeshy arth praapt karnaa hi nahin he, satya kii khoj dwaara vishwa ke liye kalyaan, sukh or shanti praapt karnaa bhi he
 Economics also tells how happiness and peace can be achieved in the world by the economic efforts of humans
 sab shastron ke samaan arthshaastra kaa uddeshy bhi vishwakalyaan he
 The view of economics is international, although it also takes into account personal and national interests
 yah sambhav he ki is shaastra kaa adhyayan kar kuch vyakti yaa raashtra dhanwaan ho jaaen or adhik dhanwaan hone kii chintaa main duusare vyakti yaa rashtron kaa shoshan karne lagen, jisase vishwa kii shanti bhang ho jaae
 But all these works related to their exploitation cannot be said to be appropriate or appropriate to economics, because economics can only support those works by which the growth of world welfare can be done
 is vivechan se spasht he ki arthshaastra kii saral paribhaasha is prakaar honi chahie-arthshaastra main munshyon ke arthsambandhi sab kaaryo kaa krambaddh adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 His mission is world welfare and his vision is international
 jisamen dhan sambandhit kriyaaon kaa aadhyayan kiya jaataa he, arthshaastra kehalaata he
 The content of economics is indicated by its definition
 arrathshaatra vah vigyaan he jo maanav ke swabhaavik vaikalpik upyog karne vaale sadhano ore unke prayog ke madhya sambandh kaa adhyayan karaata hai
 Economics has theoretical and practical importance
 arthshaastra par likhi gayi pratham pustak kautilya rachit arthshaastra he
 Economics is a very ancient discipline
 chaar upved ati pracheen kaal main banaae gaye the
 The Earth Veda is also considered to be a Upveda in these four Upvedas, but it is no longer available
 vishnupurana main bharat kii pracheen tathaa pradhan 18 vidyaon main arthshaastra bhi pariganit he
 Presumptive and Cautical economics are available at this time
 arthshaastra ke sarvapratham acharya brihaspati the
 His economics is obtained in the form of formulas, but it does not include everything related to economics
 kautilya kaa arthshaastra hi ek aisa granth he jo arthshaastra ke vishay par uplabdh krambaddh granth he, isliye iskaa mahatv sabase adhik he
 Acharya Kautilya is also famous by the name of Chanakya
 ye chandragupta maury ke mahaamantri the
 His book 'arthashastra' is often 2,300 years old in the opinion of the pundits
 acharya kautilya ke matanusaar arthshaastra kaa kshetra prithvi ko praapt karne or uski raksha karne ke upayon kaa vichaar karnaa he
 He has included many things in his economics from initiation of celibacy to conquering countries
 shaharon kaa basaanaa, guptcharon kaa prabandh, sena kii rachana, nyaayalayon kii sthapana, vivaah sambandhi niyam, daybhag, shutraon par chadhaai ke tareeke, kilabandi, sandhiyon ke bhed, vyuharachna ityadi baton kaa vistaarrup se vichaar acharya kautilya apane granth main karte hai
 Authentically, how many things in this book are outside the specified area in the modern period of economics
 usamen raajnneeti, dandniti, samajashaastra, nitishastra ityadi vishyon par bhi vichaar hua he
 The meaning of the four efforts in Indian culture is also included
 jain dharm main aparigrah kaa upadesh kiya gaya he
 Many ancient Sanskrit texts have praised or condemned wealth
 bhartruhari ne kaha he, 'survey guna kanchanam ashrayante' 
 Chanakyasutra says- arthshaastra kaa vartmaan rup main vikaas paashchaatya deshon main hua
 Adam Smith is considered the father of current economics
 aapane 'rashtron kii sampatti' naamak granth likhaa
 It was published in 1776 AD
 isamen unhone yah batalaaya he ki prayek desh ke arthshaastra kaa uddeshy us desh kii sampatti or shakti badhanaa he
 He was followed by Malthus, Ricardo, Mill, Jevons, Kaal Marx, Sizvik, Marshall, Walker, Taussig and Rabins, who wrote beautiful works on economics
 parantu arthshaastra ko ek nishchit rup dene kaa shrey profesar marshall ko praapt he, yadhyapi profesar robins kaa profesar marshall se arthshaastra ke kshetra ke sambandh main matbhed he
 Three parties certainly appear in Western economists regarding the field of economics
 pehla dal professor robins kaa he jo arthshaastra ko keval vigyaan maanakar yah sweekaar nahin karata ki arthshaastra main aisi baton par vichaar kiya jaae jinke dwaara aarthik sudhaaron ke liye maargdarshan ho
 The second team is of Professor Marshall, Professor Pigu, etc
, who accepts economics as a science, recognizes that the main subject of the study of economics is man and considered all the things which are needed for his economic growth
 It is necessary to go
 parantu is dal ke arthshaastri rajiniti se arthshaastra ko alag rakhana chaahate hai
 The third party belongs to socialists similar to Karl Marx, who considers man's labor as the only means of production and seeks the advancement of laborers by destroying capitalists and landlords
 vah mazdooron kaa raaj bhi chahta he
 There is a lot of difference in the three parties regarding the field of economics
 isliye is prashn par vichaar kar lenaa aavashyak he: After World War II, Cold War broke out in USA and Soviet Union
 yah koi yuddh nahin tha parantu isse vishwa do bhaagon main bant gaya
 America, England, Germany, Australia, France, Canada, Spain were side by side during the Cold War
 ye sabhi desh loktantric the or yahan par khuli arthvyavastha kii niti ko apanaaya gaya
 People were open to trade
 share bazaar main paisa lagane kii chhot thi
 Many big companies were formed in these countries
 in companiyon main naye-naye anusandhan hue
 Universities, information technology, engineering industry, banks, etc
 have all grown rapidly
 ye sabhi desh duusare deshon se vyapaar ko badhaava dene kii niti ko sweekaarte the
 All these countries have progressed well since 1945
 duusari taraf rus, china, myanmar, purvi germany sahit kai or desh the jahaan par samaajwaad kii arth niti apanaayi gayi
 Most of the industries here had strict government control
 udyogon se hone vaale laabh par sarkaar kaa adhikaar rahata tha
 Generally these countries did very little trade with other democratic countries
 is tarah kii arth niti ke kaaran yahaan ke udyogon main adhik pratispardhaa nahin hoti thi
 Even ordinary people had no incentive to make profit
 in karanon se in deshon main aarthik vikaas bahut kam hua
 On 3 October-1990, East Germany and West Germany merged
 sanyukt germany ne pragatishilath pashchimi germany kii tarah khuli arthvyavastha or loktantr ko apanaaya
 This was followed by the fragmentation of Soviet Russia in 1991 and the birth of 15 countries including Russia
 rus ne bhi samaajwaad ko chhodkar khuli arthvyavastha ko apanaaya
 China did not abandon socialism completely, but adopted liberal policies from the late 1970s and made great progress in the next 3 years
 checkoslovakia bhi samaajawaadee desh tha
 It fragmented into the Czech Republic and Slovakia on 1-january-1993
 in deshon ne bhi samaajwaad chhod ke loktantr or khuli arthvyavastha ko apanaaya
 The concept of value is central in economics
 isko maapne kaa ek tarika vastu kaa bazaar bhav he
 Adam Smith defined labor as the main source of value
 "mulya ke shram siddhanth" ko karl marks sahit kai arthshaastriyon ne pratipaadit kiya he
 According to this theory, the value of a service or commodity is equal to the labor used in its production
 adhikansh logon kaa maananaa he ki iskaa mulya vastu ke daam nirdhaarit karata he
 This labor theory of price is closely linked to the "production cost theory of value"
 maang aapurti kii sahaayta se purnatah pratispardhi bazaar main beche gayi vastuon keemat or maatra kii vivechna, vyakhya or purvanumaan lagaaya jaataa he
 It is one of the most fundamental forms of economics
 kramash: bade siddhanton or praroopon ke vikaas ke liye iskaa vishad rup se prayog hota he
 Demand is the quantity of a product in a fixed period that a consumer wants to buy at a fixed price and is able to buy
 maang ko saamanytah ek talika yaa graph ke rup main pradarshit karte hai jisamen keemat or icchit maatra kaa sambandh dikhaaya jaataa he
 Supply is the quantity of goods that a producer or seller is ready to sell in the market at a given price in a given time
 aapurti ko saamanytah ek talika yaa graph ke rup main pradarshit karte hai jisamen keemat or aapurti kii maatra kaa sambandh dikhaaya jaataa he
 According to Prof
 Rabins, economics is the science that studies the functions of human beings which are present as the intended object and its finite means, which are used in alternative or at least two ways
 arthshaastra kii is paribhaasha se nimnlikhit baaten spasht hoti hai- Man experiences happiness from the fulfillment of his desires
 isliye prayek manushya apni ichchhaaon ko trupt karnaa chahta he
 The means, liquids, etc
 he possesses for the fulfillment of desires are finite
 vyakti kitna bhi dhanwaan kyon na ho, uske dhan kii maatra avashya parimit rahati he; phir vah is parimit saadhan dravya kaa upyog kai tarah se kar saktaa he
 Therefore, according to the appropriate definition, economics considers all the functions of human beings, which he does by finite means to satisfy his desires
 is prakaar uske upbhog sambandhi sab kaaryo kaa vivechan arthshaastra main kiya janaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Similarly, how the means of purchasing many items in the market of a human being is limited
 is parimit saadhan dwaara vah apni aavashyak vastuen kis prakaar kharidta he, vah koun si vastu kis dar se, kis pariman main, kharidta yaa bechata he, arthath vah vinium kis prakaar karata he, in sab baton kaa vichaar arthshaastra main kiya jaataa he
 When man prepares an object, the means of preparing it remain finite and he can use those means in many ways
 isliye utpati sambandhi sab kaaryo kaa vivechan arthshaastra main hona swaabhaavik he
 Man has many desires to use his time
 parantu samay hameshaa parimit rahata he or uskaa upyog kai tarah se kiya ja saktaa he
 Suppose a person is sleeping, worshiping or playing a game
 profesar robins kii paribhaasha ke anusaar in kaaryon kaa vivechan arthshaastra main hona chahie, kyonki jo samay sone main puja main yaa khel main lagaaya gaya he, vah anya kisi kaary main lagaaya ja saktaa tha
 In any work a human being does, there is a need for time, and the use of this finite means of time must be considered in economics
 profesar robins kii arthshaastra kii paribhaasha itani vyapak he ki iske anusaar manushya ke prayek kaary kaa vivechan, chaahe vah dharmik, raajnneetik yaa saamaajik hi kyon na ho, arthshaastra ke andar aa jaataa he
 By accepting this definition, the explanation of the limitations of economics, politics, theology and sociology is not equal
 professor robins ke anuyaayiyon kaa mat he ki parimit sadhano ke anusaar manushya ke prayek kaary kaa aarthik pahalu rahata he or isi pahalu par arthshaastra main vichaar kiya jaataa he
 They say, if a work is related to the state, then its aspect should be considered in political science and if that work is also related to religion, then that aspect should be considered in theology
 maan len, ek manushya chorbazar main ek vastu ko bahut adhik mulya main bech rahaa he
 Due to finite resources, the work that he is doing and what effect it has on the production or fulfillment of the object, will be considered in economics; What is the duty of the state in relation to the perpetrator will be considered in political science or politics
 yah kaary acha he yaa bura, iskaa vichaar samajashaastra, achaarshastra yaa dharamshastra main hoga
 And, the idea of how to prevent this may not be in any scripture
 kisi bhi kaary kaa keval ek hi pahalu se vichaar karnaa uske uchit adhyayan ke liye kahan tak uchit he, yah vichaarneey he
 The second note to Professor Robbins's definition of economics is that he considers economics only as science
 usamen keval aise niyamon kaa vivechan rahata he jo kisi samay main kaary kaaran kaa sambandh batalaate hai
 These serious questions cannot be considered in what kind of changes should happen in the circumstances and what are the ways of changing the circumstances, because all these works are outside the science
 maane len, kisi samay kisi desh main sharaab pinevaale vyaktiyon kii sankhya bad rahi he
 According to Professor Robbins's definition, the only consideration in economics will be how the increase in the number of drinkers will affect the price of alcohol, the drinkers and alcoholics themselves
 parantu unke arthshaastra main is prashn par vichaar karne ke liye gunjaaish nahin he ki sharaab pinaa acha he yaa bura or sharaab pine kii aadat sarkaar dwaara kaise band kii ja sakati he
 He lacks guidance in economics
 prayek shaastra main maargdarshan uskaa ek mahatvapurn bhaag mana jaataa he or isi bhaag kaa professor robins ke arthshaastra kii paribhaasha main abhaav he
 Due to this deficiency, the study of economics cannot be beneficial to the public
 samaajawaadee chaahate hai ki poonjipatiyon or jameendaaron kaa astitv na rahane paae, sarkaar mazdooron kii ho or desh kii aarthik dasha par sarkaar kaa purna niyantran ho
 They also consider these questions in their economics books about how a labor government should be established
 jameendaaron or poonjipatiyon kaa astitv kaise mitaayaa jaae
 What kind of organization of labor government and how their organization can be done world wide
 is prakaar samaajawaadee lekhak arthshaastra kaa kshetra itnaa vyapak bana dete hai ki usamen raajnneetishastra kii bahut si baaten aa jaati hai
 We should define the field of economics in such a way that it does not include the things of political science or any other scripture
 arthshaastra ke kshetra ke sambandh main professor marshall kii arthshaastra kii paribhaasha par bhi vichaar kar lenaa aavashyak he
 According to Professor Marshall, economics studies the ordinary work related to human life
 vah manushyon ke aise vyaktigat or samjik kaaryon kii jaanch karata he jinka ghanishtha sambandh unke kalyaan ke nimit bhautik saadhan praapt karne or unka upyog karne se rahata he
 Professor Marshall has increased the field of economics by placing the welfare of the municipality in the definition of economics
 parantu is arthshaastri ne bhi arthshaastra ke dhyey ke sambandh main apni pustak main kuch vichaar nahin kiya
 In the present day Western economists have increased the field of economics, but even today, they do not accept the idea of economics in the field of economics
 ab to arthshaastra ko kala kaa rup diya ja rahaa he
 Economic plans are discussed everywhere in the world
 aarthik yojana taiyaar karnaa ek kala he
 No plan can be prepared without a goal
 arthshaastra ko koi bhi sarvasafal nishchit dhyey na hone ke kaaran in yojana taiyaar karanevaalon kaa bhi koi ek dhyey nahin he
 Each scheme assumes a different goal
 arthshaastra main ab deshavaasiyon kii dasha sudhaarney ke tareekon par bhi vichaar kiya jaataa he, parantu is dasha sudhaarney kaa antim lakshya abhi tak nishchit nahin ho paaya he
 In the absence of a well-known goal, there has been so much difference among economists that one opinion of two economists on a subject is difficult
 is matbhinnata ke kaaran arthshaastra ke adhyayan main ek badi baadha upasthit ho gai he
 To overcome this hurdle, Western economists should think seriously about the objective of economics in their texts and should, as far as possible, make a well-known goal of economics early
 sansar main prayek vyakti adhik se adhik sukhi hona or du:kha se bachanaa chahta he
 He knows that happiness is attained when his desire is satisfied and when the desire is not fulfilled, then he experiences sorrow
 dhan dwaara icchit vastu praapt karne main sahaayta milti he
 Therefore, every person tries to get wealth
 vah samajhataa he ki sansar main dhan dwaara hi sukh kii prapti hoti he
 To get maximum happiness, he tries to get more and more wealth
 is dhan ko praapt karne kii chintaa main vah praaia: yah vichaar nahin karata ki dhan kis prakaar se praapt ho rahaa he
 The result of this is that money is also obtained by means of which others are exploited, others are hurt
 is prakaar dhan praapt karne ke anek udhaaharan die ja sakate hai
 The capitalist does not give fair wages to his laborers in the worry of getting more money
 isse mazdooron kii dasha bigadane lagati he
 The shopkeeper destroys the health of his customers by adulterating foods
 chorbazari dwaara anek saral vyakti thage jate hai, mahajan karjadaaron se atyadhik sood lekar or jameendaar kisaanon se atyadhik lagaan lekar asankhya vyaktya ke pariwaron ko barabaad kar dete hai
 It is the unwavering law of nature that what one sows has to be reaped
 dusron kaa shoshan kar yaa du:kha pahunchaakar dhan praapt karanevaale is niyam ko shaayad bhul jate hai
 The wealth that you get by hurting others, you only get sorrow in the end
 usase sukh kii aashaa karnaa vyarth he
 It is true that the desired things can be obtained from the wealth which is obtained by hurting others and by obtaining these things one can get happiness
 parantu yah sukh asthaayee he or ant main dukh kaa kaaran ho jaataa he
 There are many such things in the world, which brings immediate happiness by using it, but in the long run, they get sadness
 udaahranarth maadak vastuon ke seven se tatkaal to sukh miltaa he, paratu jab unki aadat pad jaati he tab unka seven atyadhik maatra main hone lagata he, jiskaa swasthya par bura prabhaav padataa he
 This causes sadness in the end
 dusron ko haani pahunchaakar jo dhan praapt hota he vah nishchit rup se buree aadaton ko badhaata he or kuch samay tak asthaayee sukh dekar vah du:kha badhaane kaa saadhan ban jaataa he
 Money obtained by giving grief to others can never be a seeker of lasting happiness and peace
 sukh do prakaar ke hai
 There are some pleasures which are achieved by hurting others
 inke udhaaharan upar die ja chuke hai
 There are some pleasures which are achieved by making others happy
 ve manushya ke man main shanti utpann karte hai
 The happiness that comes from performing one's duty also gives peace, the labor that one has to do while performing duty, definitely brings some pain, but on completion of the work, that sorrow results in happiness and from that Peace arises in is prakaar kaa sukh bhavishya main du:kha kaa saadhan nahin hota ore is prakaar ke sukh ko anand kehete hai
 When pleasure is attained, then there is no more than just a trace of sorrow
 aisi dasha ko paramanand kehete hai
 Achieving ecstasy is the best goal of every person
 vahi aatmakalyaan kii charam seemaa he
 It is the welfare of every human being in this that he always tries to achieve ecstasy
 vah hameshaa aisa sukh praapt karata rahe jo bhavishya main du:kha kaa kaaran yaa saadhan na ban jaae or vah shanti or santosh kaa anubhav karne lage
 When we bring happiness to others through our efforts and become the means of their welfare, then according to the adamant law of nature, our welfare also starts to increase by these efforts
 aatmakalyaan praapt karne kaa saral upaay dusron ke kalyaan kaa saadhan bananaa he
 Similarly, not to hurt anyone through your actions is the simplest way to avoid your misery
 prayek vyakti ko yah acchhee tarah samaj lenaa chahie ki uskaa sachcha hitsaadhan dusron ke hitsaadhan yaa parmarth dwaara hi siddh ho saktaa he
 It is clear from this that the happiness of others ie Vishwakalyan is the only means of their lasting happiness and peace ie autobiography
 jab prayek vyakti apana kalyaan karne ke liye dusron ke kalyaan kaa hameshaa praytn karne lagegaa tab kisi bhi tarah se swaartho kaa virodh na hoga, sansar main sab prakaar kaa sangharsh dur ho jayega or sarvatra sukh or shanti sthaayee rup se sthapit ho jaaegi
 It is necessary for autism that each person gives as much importance to the selfishness of others as he gives to his selfishness
 jaise vah apane sukhon ko badhaane kaa praytn karata he, vaise hi use dusron ke sukhon ko badhaane kaa bhi praytn karnaa chahie
 The result of this will be that such works will be stopped due to which the suffering of others increases
 isse vishwa ke jeevon main sukh kii nirantar vruddhi hone lagegi or vishwa kaa kalyaan badhate badhate charam seemaa tak pahunch jayega
 Without Vishwakalyan, no person can be autistic
 sachcha aatmakalyaan vishwa kalyaan dwaara hi praapt ho saktaa he
 Autism is the best goal of every person and when economics studies the economic efforts of man, then his aim should also be autism
 parantu, jaisaa upar batalaaya ja chukaa he, sachcha aatmakalyaan vishwa kalyaan dwaara hi praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the aim of economics should be world welfare
 ham yah pehle hi bataa chuke hai ki jab kisi ichha kii purti nahin hoti tab du:kha kaa anubhav hota he
 Therefore, if there is no desire for anything, then there is no opportunity to get sorrow
 kuch sajjanon kaa mat he ki sampurna ichchhaaon kii nivruti dwaara du:kha kaa abhaav or sthaayee sukh tathaa shanti praapt ho sakati he
 Therefore, if seen from this point of view, then lack of all desires should be the aim of economics
 yah thik he ki abhyaas dwaara ichchhaaon kaa niyantran avashya kiya ja saktaa he, parantu aisi dasha praapt kar lenaa jab kisi bhi prakaar kii ichha utpann hi na hone paae, saadhaaran manushya main se ek ke liye bhi vyaavhaarik nahin he
 Astu, the goal of economics is to accept the lack of complete desires for the welfare of only a few people and the public will not benefit anything from it, so it will not be appropriate to accept this goal
 kuch vyakti maanavkalyaan hi arthshaastra kaa dhyey maanate hai
 They do not consider it necessary to take care of the interests of animals and animals
 ve shaayad yah maanate hai ki jeevajantuon or pashu pakshiyon ko ishwar ne manushya ke sukh ke liye hi utpann kiya he
 Therefore, if the desires of human beings can be fulfilled by hurting or killing them, then there should be no objection in making them sad
 kintu dharamshastra or mahatma gandhi kaa to yah mat he ki prayek vyakti ko aisa hi kaary karnaa chahie jisase 'saarvbhaum hit' arthath sab jeevadhariyon kaa hit ho, kisi kii bhi haani na hone paae
 When a person starts treating the interest of every living being as his own, only then he gets permanent happiness and peace
 mahatma gandhi ne is maarg ko 'sarvoday' naam diya he
 It is only through this Sarvodaya Path that every type of conflict in the world can be overcome, exploitation can end and world peace can be established
 sarvoday kaa maarg prayek vyakti kaa kalyaan ore vishwakalyaan kii vruddhi karne kaa uttam saadhan he
 Therefore, according to him, the aim of economics should not be to consider human welfare but only to believe in world welfare
 arthshaastra kii vishay saamagree ke sambandh main aarthik kriyaaon kaa varnan bhi jaruri he
 Earlier, production, consumption, exchange and distribution were considered as the four major parts of economics
 aadhunik arthshaastra main in kriyaaon ko paanch bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he
 On the basis of the purpose of economic activities, in 1933, Regner Frisch first divided economics into two parts
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, videshi vinium, banking aadi samshti arthshaastra ke rup hai
 In short, from the point of view of study, we can put different parts of economics in this way: yah vaiyaktik ikaayiyon kaa adhyayan karata he, jaise vyakti, parivaar, form, udyog, vishesh vastu kaa mulya
 According to Bolding, microeconomics is the study of special firms, special families, individual prices, workers, incomes, individual industries, and specialty goods
 yah seemaant vishleshan ko mahatv detaa he
 Many important topics of modern economic theory such as international trade, foreign exchange, revenue, banking, business cycle, national income and employment theory, economic planning and economic development etc
 are studied under it
 boldig ke shabdon main, samshti arthshaastra, arthshaastra kaa vah bhaag he jo arthshaastra ke bade samoohon or ausaton kaa adhyayan karata he, na ki uski vishesh madon kaa
 He tries to define these groups in a useful way and examines their mutual relations
 sankshep main ye hi arthshaastra ke ang he
 Modern economists after Cannes now discuss various parts of economics by some new names, such as economics of capital, capital formation, labor economics, economics of traffic, monetary economics, canyon economics, economics of underdeveloped countries, economics of development , Comparative economics, international economics etc
 aadhunaki kaal main desh videsh main arthshaastra vishay kii snatakottar shiksha bhi inhen naamon ke prashnpatron ke anusaar di jaati he
 Economic system) is a system under which people earn their livelihood by working in various occupations
 aarthik kriyaaon ko sucharu rup se sanchalit karne ke liye prayek desh alag-alag aarthik pranali apanaataa hai
 Economic systems are mainly divided into three parts
 aadhunik arthik praniliyon main samaajwaad tathaa poonjeevaad kaa sarvaadhik ullekh ho rahaa he
 Every country, whether it works under any economic system, has to face various economic problems like poverty, inequality of wealth and income, unemployment, inflation and recession
 in samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye vah vibhinn nitiyon ko apanaataa he
 The main economic policies are as follows
 bharat kii arthshaastra ko jaanane, samajhane or prayog main laane kii apni vishesh panrapara rahi he
 It is a matter of sorrow that the major works of ancient and new Indian economists have not yet been properly evaluated and our students have been studying only Western economists and their theories
 pracheen kaal ke aarthik vichaaron ko ham vedon, upanishdon, mahakavyon, dharamshastron, grihmasutron, naarad, shukr, vidura ke nitigranthon or sarvaadhik rup se kautilya ke arthshaastra se praapt karte hai
 Among the main Indian economists in modern India - mahatma gandhi dwaara pranit tathaa acharya vinoba bhaave dwaara prayog main laai gai arthshaastra kii yah vichaardhaara ati aadhunik he or bharatiyon kii vishisht dein he
 Under this, there are ideas like Gramswarajya, Swavalamban, use of coexistence and non-violent revolution, which, in Jayaprakash Narayan's words, can bring economic revolution anytime anywhere in the world, not only in India
 inkaa prayog nai shiksha ke saath saath bharat main ho rahaa he
 Modern economics is tied up in more than half of mathematical models, practices, equations and formulas
 purv main sankhyikee kaa prayog arthshaastri aichhik rup se karte the parantu ab vah arthshaastra ke hetu anivaary ho gaya he
 Apart from this, econometrics is also being developed in full in development
 pravagic rup main 'in-put out-put vishleshan' se lekar arthshaastra ne 'game theory' tathaa 'technical flo' tak nikaal daalaa he
 All economists are using mathematical tools to clarify economic principles
 lenior programing' tathaa 'vibhedikikaran prakriya' ke antargat arthshaastri ganitiya drishy prabhaavon ke saath-saath adrishy aarthik prabhaavon ko bhi dikhaane kaa praytn kar rahe hai
 From the small machine of calculation to the largest computer, economists have practical forms of mathematical progress
 sambhavat: agle do teen dashak tak aisi vidhiyaan avishkrut ho jaayengi jinase ganitiya vidhiyon dwaara ati sankshep main keval nishkarsh praapt honge tathaa prakriya kaa koi bhi talmail baithaana aavashyak na hoga
 Nowadays economists are relying most on mathematical economics method
 vyaavhaarik arthshaastra garib evam sadhanrahit deshon kii vyaavhaarik samasyaon ko sulajhaa rahaa he
 The Asian drama by Gunar Cridal is perhaps the largest economical treatise published after Marx's slave capital, which solved the problems of underdeveloped countries

 Under this, current international problems such as planning, capital formation and foreign aid are studied
 arthshaastra kaa mahatv badi teevr gati se badhata ja rahaa he
 According to the United Nations Affake Report, E
, about 1,000 texts or articles on economics are being published every hour in the world
 raajnneeti ke baad lokapriyata main arthshaastra kaa hi sthaan hai
 In fact, economics has to be used for welfare, otherwise one day it will drown everyone by aiming to raise material resources
 santosh kii baat he ki ab arthshaastri is baat ko samajhane lage hai
 The ancient philosophy of India knows from the beginning that mere multiplicity of material means cannot make a person happy
 pro shumpiter ne apane naveenatam lekh arthshaastra kaa bhavishya main sweekaar kiya he ki siddhant rup se aarthik vishleshan chaahe jitani pragati kar le, vyavhaar main use hameshaa shanti, sukh evam kalyaan ke hetu hi kaary karnaa hoga
 If economics can work for the welfare of all human beings, then its future will be bright
 isi kaaran ab arthshaastra par nobel puraskaar bhi diya jane laga he
 The main limitations of economics are as follows: asamiya lipi 'purvi nagari' kaa ek rup he jo asamiya ke saath-saath bangla or vishnupuria manipuri ko likhane ke liye prayog kii jaati he

 In regular expression or regular expression computing, there is a concise, flexible, and convenient way to search or find and replace strings
 udhaaharan ke liye kam khojane par yah camel ko bhi khojega or qamar ko bhi
 Regular expressions are abbreviated as regex or regexp
 regular oxpraishan kaa prayog kai programmen bhashaaon main karnaa sambhav he iske prayog se ek hi line main bahut badi baat kahi yaa likhi ja sakati he jisase program chota or suvachy ho jaataa he
 For those who are not programmers, it is very much used as a 'find and Replace'
 nimnlikhit udhaaharan kuch aisi visheshtaon ko spasht karte hai, jinhen regular oxpraishan main abhivyakt kiya ja sake: Regular expressions can be even more complex than these examples: Regular expressions have been used by many text editors to search for and customize textual patterns based on usability and patterns in the programming of languages
 udhaaharan ke liye, Perl, Ruby or Tcl shashakt regular oxpraishan engine unke vaakya vinyas main bana hua he
 Many of the utilities offered by Unix distributions - editor ed and filter grep - were the first to popularize the concept of regular expressions
 vaakya rachana ke ek udhaaharan ke rup main, regular oxpraishan \ bex kaa prayog "shabd simaaon" ke baad aane vaale "ex " string ke sabhi udaahranon kii khoj ke liye ho saktaa he
 In superficial terminology, \ bex will find its corresponding string "ex" in two possible fields, at the beginning of words and between two characters in a string, one of which is a word character and the other is not a word character
 
 is prakaar, string main "texts for experts", \ bex "exparts" main to "ex " ke saath mail khaataa he, lekin "texts" main mail nahin khaataa 
 Many modern computing systems provide wildcard characters to match filenames to a file system
 yah kai cmand-line shells kii abhyantar kshamta he, jise globing ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Wildcards typically differ from regular expressions in terms of limiting only options
 regular oxpraishan vaakya vinyas kii utpatti main upyogi hai jo pranaaliyon ko ujagar karte hai, jaise ki data satyaapan or kai anya kaaryon ke nishpaadan main
 Regular expressions will be useful for search engines such as Google, Bing or Yahoo! In Search, processing through the entire database will cost more computer resources, considering the complexity and design of the regex
 haalanki kai sthitiyon main system prashaasak rijex aadhaarit aantarik prashnon ko chalaa saktaa he, adhiktar search ingine logon ko rijex kii sahaayta uplabdh nahin karaate
 ek ullekhneey apwaad google code search he
 Regular expression, also often referred to as a pattern, is a pointer that describes in detail a set of strings
 unka upyog aamtaur par tatwon kii suchi banaae bina set ke bare main sankshep main bataane ke liye hota he
 For example, 'set' which consists of three strings "handel", "händel" and "haendel" can be described as h ndel's pattern
 In most formalisms, if a regex matches a particular set, it should be known that there are an infinite number of such indicators
 adhikansh akaarwaad nimnlikhit kriyaaon ke liye regular oxpraishan banaati hai
 "gray" or "gray" matches with | gray
 |grey or gry samroop patterns hai, jo "gray " or "grey " donon hi set ko varnit karte hai
 For example, ab * c matches "ac", "abc", "abbc", "abbbc" and so on
 in banaavaton ko manamaane dhang se jatil suchakon ke gathan ke liye ek saath jod diya ja saktaa he, thik usee tarah jis tarah koi ankaganitiya suchakon kaa gathan sankhyaon evam sankriyaaon +, −, × or ÷ se kar saktaa he
 For example, both Hndel and Hndel are authentic patterns, which match the same folding strings as in the previous example, the previous example being Hndel
 regular oxpraishan ke liye sateek vaakya-vinyas upkarnon or sandarbh ke saath badalte rahete hai; adhik vivaran "vaakya-vinyas" khand main diya gaya he
 The roots of regular expression lie in automata theory and formal language theory, both of which are part of theoretical computer science
 ye kshetra prashikshan computeshan evam aupchaarik bhashaaon ke varnan evam vargeekaran kii paddatiyon ke model hai
 In the 1950s, mathematician Stephen Cole Klein described these models in detail using his mathematical notation, called regular sets

 He later added this capability to the Unix editor ed, which eventually led to the discovery of Grape, a popular search tool for the use of regular expressions
 Over time, Thompson's fundamental version of regular expressions has undergone many changes, with widespread applicability like Unix and Unix, including expr, AWK, Emacs, vi, and lex
 Perl or Tcl regular oxpraishan henry spencer likhit rijex librari se lee gai thim, haalanki Perl ko spencer kii librari main anek nai visheshtaayen jodne ke liye prasaarit kiya gaya
 Philip Hazel developed PCRE, which tries to mimic Perl's regular expression functionality, and is used by many modern tools PHP and Apache HTTP Server

 parinamswaroop ek laghu bhashaa Perl 6 niyam bani, jiskaa prayog Perl 6 grammer ko paribhaashit karne or saath hi saath bhashaa main programmers ke liye upkaran muhaiyaa karaane ke liya hota he
 These rules uphold the features of Perl 5

 bhashaa maanakon main sanrachana kii suspashtataa ke centre main regular oxpraishan hai
 The simple use of the DTD element in group syntax is obvious
 pattern milan: itihaas bhi dekhen Regular expression can be defined as formal language theory
 regular oxpraishan main sthiraank or operators hote hai, jo strings ke sets in seton par kriyashltaaon ko kramshah suchit karte hai
 The following definitions are standard and found in most textbooks of formal language theory
 Given a bounded alphabet Σ, the following constants are defined: nimnlikhit sankriyaayein paribhaashit hai: | denotes α in r and β in S}
 udhaaharan ke liye {"ab", "c"}{"d", "ef"} = {"abd", "abef", "cd", "cef"}
 | s which indicates the alliance of r and S
 udhaaharan ke liye {"ab", "c"}|{"ab", "d", "ef"} = {"ab", "c", "d", "ef"}
 To avoid parentheses, it has been assumed that clean star has the highest priority, followed by a combination and then a set alliance
 If there is no doubt, parentheses may be omitted
 udhaaharan ke liye, c ko abc or a|) ko a|bc* jaisaa bhi likhaa ja saktaa he
 Many textbooks use ∪, +, or ∨ signs for combination instead of perpendicular bars
 udhaaharan: | b * denotes {ε, {0} a, b, bb, bbb, 


}
 |b)* khaali string: {ε, {0}a, b, aa, ab, ba, bb, aaa, 


} samet a or b ke alaava bina pratik chihnon ke sabhi string ke set ko sanketit karata he
 | ε) denotes a set of strings starting with a, then zero or more bs and ending with the option ac: {{0} a, ac, ab, abc, abb, abbc, 


}
 regular oxpraishan kii aupchaarik paribhaasha jaanboojhkar kifayati he or anaavashyak parimank ? se bachane ke liye tathaa +, jise : a+ = aa* or a?= ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 Sometimes the complement operator is added; All sets of strings on Rc σ * that are not in r c are indicated
 niyamtah poorak oparator anaavashyak he, jaisaa ki duusare operataron kaa upyog kar ise simit kiya ja saktaa he
 However, such a formulation computing process is complex and this may require indicators of size that are exponentially twice as large
 is arth main regular oxpraishan suvyavasthit bhashaa ko suchit kar sakate hai, thik-thik bhashaa kii aisi shrenee jo niyamaatmak parimit autometa ke dwaara sweekrut he
 However, there is a notable difference in consistency
 suvyavasthit bhashaaon kii kuch shreniyon ko niyamaatmak parimit autometa dwaara varnit kiya ja saktaa he, jiskaa aakaar ghaataanki rup se sabase chote regular oxpraishan ke samakaksh bad jaataa he
 Languages are the standard example here
 Lk varna {{0}a,b } par jiskaa antim akshar k a kii barabari apane sabhi strings sahit karata he
 On the one hand, the regular expression describing l 4 is given by ∗ a { \ displaystyle ^ {*} a}
 is pattern ko Lk main samanyikaran suchak detaa he On the other hand, it is well known that the transitive finite automaton accepting the Lk language must have at least 2k k in many cases
 bhagyavash, regular oxpraishan se adhik aam aniyatatmak parimit autometa tak saral maanchitran he, jo achaanak itnaa bada visphotak aakaar grahan nahin kar letaa; yahi kaaran he ki nfas ko aksar suvyavasthit bhashaaon ke vaikalpik nirupan ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 nfas are simple transformations of the type-3 grammers of the Chomsky sequence
 ant main, yah dhyaan dene yogya baat he ki vastav jagat main anek regular oxpraishan engine aisi visheshtaon ko lagu karte hai, jise regular oxpraishan ke dwaara aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant ke arth main varnit nahin kiya ja saktaa; is vishay par adhikadhik jaankaree ke liye neeche dekhen
 As seen from the examples, various regular expressions can express the same language: formalism is unnecessary
 kalanvidhi main lekhan sambhav he jo die gaye regular oxpraishan ke madhya yah nirnay karne ke liye ki ullikhit bhashaaen anivaary rup se ek samaan hai ki nahin
 yah prayek abhivyakti ko nunatam niyatatmak parimit sthiti mashin kii had tak kam kar detaa he or nirdhaarit karata he ki kya ve samakritik samakaksh hai yaa nahin
 To what extent can this redundancy be removed? Can we find an interesting subset of regular expressions that are fully suggestive? An alliance of clean stars and sets is obviously necessary, but perhaps we can ban their use
 yah ascharyajanak rup se kathin samasya main badal saktaa he
 Regular expressions are so simple that there is no way to rewrite them in any form
 In the past the lack of self-certification led to the problem of Star Height

 Traditional Unix regular expression syntax did not follow common conventions, but often differed from device to device
 IEEE POSIX basic regular oxpraishan maanak khaskar ulti anukulata ke liye paramparaagat vaakya-vinyas ke saath ise dizine kiya gaya, kintu isane ek saamaanya maanak uplabdh karaayaa jise kai Unix regular oxpraishan upkarnon ke vyatikram vaale vaakya-vinyas ke rup main apana liya gaya he, haalanki isamen ab bhi aksar kuch vividhtaayen athwa atirikt visheshtaayen dikhaai detii hai
 There are several tools that support ERE syntax with command line topics
 BRE vaakya-vinyas main, adhikansh aksharon ko shabdic arth main liya jaataa he -- ve aapas main ek duusare se mail khate hai 
 neeche soochibaddh apwaadon ko aksharon se pare yaa anukramon se alag kaha jaataa he
 Examples: aksharon se pare kaa arth bekaslash se bachakar kuch aksharon ke liye POSIX vistrut regular oxpraishan ke vaakya-vinyas main vipareet he
 In this syntax itself, a backslash causes meta characters to be treated as literal characters
 atah udhaaharan ke liye, \ ab he or \ { \ } ab { }
 saath hi saath, pichley sandarbhon ke liye ko hataa liya gaya he or nimnlikhit aksharon se pare ko shaamil kiya gaya hai: Examples: |dog "cat " yaa "dog " ke saath mail khaataa he
 POSIX extended regular expressions can often be used with modern Unix applicability by including the command line flag -E
 chunki aksharon kii anek vargeekrut shreniyan chune hue sthaneey setting, POSIX maanak aksharon kii kuch shreniyon athwa virgon ko nimna talika main dikhaaya gaya he: POSIX character categories can only be used within parentheses
 udhaaharan ke liye, ab] ucchvarg ke bade aksharon evam chote aksharon "a " or "b " ke saath hi mail khaataa he
 In Perl's regular expression, coincides with and combines with
 ek atirikt gaiyr-posix shrenee ko kuch upkarnon ke dwaara samajha gaya he vah he, jise aamtaur par plus rekhankan underscore ke dwaara paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 This raises the fact that in many programming languages these are the characters that can be used as identification marks
 sampadak Vim aage verde or verde-head shrenee ke bich antar spasht karte hue pahchaan bataate hai 
 chunki kai programing bhashaaon main jo akshar pahchaan chihn ke rup main aarambh kar sakate hai ve unke samaan nahin hai, jo anya sthiti main upasthit ho sakate hai
 It is noted that POSIX regular expression standards call character classes in the color of other regular expressions, which support them, they are commonly referred to as POSIX character classes
 adhikansh anya regular oxpraishan flavors ke saath kairactor claces pad-bandha kaa prayog POSIX nirdhaarit koshthak suchakon kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Perl has a more consistent and rich syntax than POSIX Basic and Extended Regular Expression Standards
 isaki nirantarata kaa ek udhaaharan he ki \ hameshaa gaiyr-varnankit aksharon se alag bhaagta he
 Another example of functionality is possible with Perl, but not with POSIX - the subsequent regular expression concept of sluggish quantification
 vyapak rup se apni suchak kshamta ke kaaran kai anya prayojyata or programing kii bhashaaon ne vaakya-vinyas ko Perl kii hi tarah apana liya he -- udhaaharan ke liye, Java, javascript, PCRE, Python, Ruby, Microsoft's 
NET Framework or w3c's XML Schema sabhi regular oxpraishan vaakya-vinyas kaa prayog Perl kii hi tarah karte hai
 Some languages and tools such as Boost and PHP support multiple regular expression flavors
 Perl vyutpann regular oxpraishan ke karyanvayan main ekarupata nahin he or kuch keval Perl kii visheshtaon ke subset ko hi karyanvit karte hai
 The process of Perl 5
10 has reached Perl corporate syntax extensions with its completeness and breadth - originally from Python, PCRE, 
NET Framework and Java
 saral regular oxpraishan aisa vaakya-vinyas he, jinka prayog computer aplication program ke aitihaasik sanskarnon main kiya ja saktaa he evam apane antargat kuch anuprayogon ke dwaara sahyog bhi paa saktaa he
 It has been deemed inappropriate for the purpose of providing previous conformity
 regular oxpraishan main maanak parimaapak laalchee hai arthath ve jitna mail kha sakate hai adhik se adhik utani baar mail khate hai, baaki ko rijex ke saath koi nayaa mail khaane ke liye chhod dete hai
 For example, someone new to regexes who wants to find the first instance between a single item can find between the symbols in this example
 ek or whale explozan, ko ghatit hua
 


 who would like to come with the pattern or similar
 However this pattern would actually like to go back to "" instead of "", which was expected, because * quantification is greedy - so it would want to consume as many characters as possible from input, and "january 26>, "will have more characters than" January 26 "
 haalanki is samasya ko kai tareekon se taala ja saktaa he, aadhunik regular oxpraishan upkaran ek parimank ko sust ke rup main vaishishty paane kii anumati dete hai parimank ke baad ek prashnchihn lagaakar kiya jaataa he, athwa sanshodhak kaa prayog kar jo parimank ke laalach ko ulat detaa he 
 sust parimank kaa prayog kar suchak sabase pehle kam se kam mail khaane kii koshish karte hai
 Although slack mail is used in the preceding example to select one of the results of multiple matches, in some cases it can also be used for better performance, when greedy matching needs to backfire
 
 avyavasthit bhashaaon ke liye pattern aadhunik regular oxpraishan sangrahon se praapt kai visheshtaayen suchak kshamta pradaan karti he jo suvyavasthit bhashaaon se bhi adhik ho jaati he
 For example, many implementations allow the grouping of subindexers and reminds the value of matching in the same indicator
 iskaa arth yah he ki ek pattern duhraaye gaye shabdon kii ladiyon se mail kha saktaa he, jaise ki "papa " athwa "wikiwiki ", jise aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant main squares kehete hai
 The pattern for these battles is \ 1
 haalanki, squares kii bhashaa suvyavasthit nahin he
 Nor is it free from the subject
 back refrences kii aseemit sankhyaon pattern ke saath mail khaataa, jaise ki aseemit sankhya main aadhunik upkaran dwaara samarthit, en pi-sampoorn he 
 However, many tools, libraries and engines that provide such structures still use regular expression terminology for their patterns
 isane regular oxpraishan shabdaawalee kaa namakaran kiya he, jiske aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant tathaa pattern ke kai bhinn arth hai
 For this reason, some people use regex or simply pattern terminology to interpret the latter
 parl programing bhashaa ke lekhak, laire wal ek niabandh main parl 6 ke dizin ke bare main likhte hai: There are at least three different Kalaan methods, algorithms that determine how a given regular expression matches a string
 sabase puraane or sabase tej parinaam par nirbhar do aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant jo prayek garaniyatatmak parimit sthiti yantra ko niyatatmak parimit sthiti mashin main roopantarit karnaa sweekaar karata he
 DFA can be explicitly constructed and then consequently operates on the input one symbol at a time
 ek regular oxpraishan ke aakaar ke liye DFA kaa nirmaan "O" kii keemat par karne par samay or smriti aa jaati he, lekin yah n aakaar ke string par hi o samay main chal saktaa he
 An alternative effort is to emulate the NFA directly, essentially creating each DFA position on demand and then dropping it out, possibly caching on the next step
 This keeps DFA implicit and the exponential cost of manufacture can be avoided, but the running cost increases to O
 is spasht padakshep ko DFA kalanvidhi kehete hai or antarnihit padakshep ko NFA kalanvidhi
 jaise ki ek samaan DFA ko kriyanvit karne main donon ko bhinn tareekon se dekha ja saktaa he, unhen bhi bina bhed-bhav ke aksar kalanvidhi kehete hai
 These algorithms are fast, but their use for returning grouped subheads is a tricky quantification and complicates similar features
 teesri kalanvidhi back trek ke dwaara pattern ke saath input string ke milan ke liye he
 This algorithm is commonly called NFA, but the terminology is unclear
 iskaa chalan samay ghaataanki ho saktaa he, jiskaa saral karyanvayan yah ujagar karata he ki jab suchakon ke khilaaf milan jaise ki *b jisame prayaavartan or aseemit parimann donon hi hai
 Emphasize the algorithm to consider the increasing exponential number of substitute cases
 More complex implementations often mark and speed up or cancel simple cases when their behavior is slowed
 haalanki back trekking karyanvayan sabase kharaab sthiti main ek ghaataanki guarantee dete hai, ve bahut adhik lacheelaapan or suchak shakti pradaan karte hai
 For example, any implementation that allows the use of backreferences or implements the various extensions implemented by Perl must use a back tracking implementation
 kuch karyanvayan sabase pehle tej DFA ko chalaakar do sabase acchhee kalan vidhiyaan uplabdh karaate hai, yah jaanane ke liye ki regular oxpraishan string ke saath thoda bhi mail khate hai yaa nahin or keval isi sthiti main sambhawatah mand back trekking milan hota he
 Regular expression was used with the letters ASCII

 In most cases there is no difference in what the set of characters is, but in some cases there is a difference when regular expressions have to work on Unicode

 omprakash makhija 1970 ke dashak main mumbai film udyog main ek junior kalakaar he
 He and his friend Pappu are struggling to become the lead artist
 om kii maa, bela makhija, apane bete ko protsaahit karti rahati he
 Om's Dil Ki Dhadakan is the country's most popular film heroine, Shantipriya
 omprakash ko shantipriya ke nikat jane ke do avasar milte hai
 At the premiere of the first film 'dreamgirl', where Om and Pappu cleverly enter
 doosraa film ke set par jahaan om apni jaan par khel kar shanti ko aag se bachaata he
 Since then Om and Shanti become good friends
 ek din om sheersh nirmaataa mukesh mehara ke saath ho rahe shanti ke vivaad ko sun letaa he
 Om is shocked to learn that Shanti is secretly married to Mukesh and is pregnant
 mukesh ada he ki shanti ke saath apane sambandhon ko tabatak gupt rakhega jabatak un donon kii nayi film 'om shanti om' puri nahin ho jaati
 Shanti suspects that Mukesh is planning to marry the daughter of a wealthy businessman
 vah mukesh se apane adhikaron kii maang karti he
 Om's heart breaks after hearing all this
 ek raat, mukesh shanti ko 'om shanti om' film ke set par le jaataa he
 He says that he will stop the film and get married peacefully in front of the whole society
 kintu yah mukesh kii ek chaal nikalati he
 He considers peace to be the reason for his financial loss
 isaliye vah set ko aag lagaakar shanti ko vahaan marane ke liye chhod detaa he
 Om attempts to save Shanti, but Mukesh's guards do not let him do it
 visphot ke kaaran om vahaan se dur girtaa he or ek car ke neeche aa jaataa he
 The owner of that car, Rajesh Kapoor is a famous actor who is taking his pregnant wife Lovely to the hospital for delivery
 rajesh om ko bhi aspataal le jaataa he
 But Om dies
 kuch palon ke baad yah pataa chalata he ki rajesh kapur ke bete kaa janm hua he
 This child is the reincarnation of Omprakash Makhija
 naye jivan main uskaa naam om kapur rakhaa jaataa he
 He becomes a popular movie star "O K" when he is an adult

 One day, Om goes to the place where a set of 'om Shanti Om' caught fire, for shooting a film
 jaale hue set ko dekh kar om kii purvajanm kii yaaden ubharne lagati hai
 Then at a party, Om encounters Mukesh Mehra, who, meanwhile, has become a successful Hollywood filmmaker
 use dekhte hi om ko purvajanm kii sari baaten spasht rup se yaad aa jaati hai
 She then has an emotional reunion with Bella and Pappu
 shanti kii mrityu kaa badla lene ke liye om kapur pappu, bela or anya saathiyon ke saath milakar ek yojana banaata he
 Om decides to Mukesh that they will both produce the film 'om Shanti Om' again
 phir om or uske sahaayak shantipriya kii hamshakl kii talash karte hai
 They find a girl named Sandhya or 'sandi' who is like a Shantipriya and a 'O K' addict
 or phir unki yojana shuru hoti he-- om mukesh ke saath khel kheltaa he
 Sandi comes in front of Mukesh in the form of Shanti
 mukesh sochataa he ki vah shanti kii aatma he or bhaybheet rahane lagata he
 But then one day Mukesh knows that this woman is someone else, not peace
 vah satark ho jaataa he
 Finally, Om and Mukesh scramble on the set
 om kahata he ki vah purvajanm main mukesh dwaara shanti kii hatya kaa gavaah tha
 Mukesh challenges him that no court will believe in the matter of previous birth
 tabhi shanti ke vesh main ek yuvati vahaan aakar kahati he ki set par lage jhumar ke thik neeche hatya kaa subut dabaa hua he-- uskaa sharir, jise mukesh ne jivit hi bhoomi ke neeche dafna diya tha
 She stops Om from attacking Mukesh
 baribharakam jhumar neeche girtaa he or mukesh usase dab jaataa he
 Sandy enters the room with Pappu from the other side
 tab om ko samaj aata he ki subut kii baat bataane vaali sandy nahin, asli shantipriya kii aatma thi, jisane apane hatyare se badla le liya
 The soul of peace, seeing Om with compassion, smiles and disappears

 jelifish ke kai alag rup hai jo scyphosoa, storosoa, cubosoa or hydrosoa sahit vibhinn niderian virgon kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai
 In these groups, jellyfish are also called, respectively, scyphomedusae, storomedusae, cubomedusae and hydromedusae
 sabhi jelifish upsang medusosoa main sannihit hai
 Medusa is another term for jellyfish and is therefore used exclusively for the adult phase of the life-cycle
 jelifish har samudr main, sataha se samudr kii gaharaai tak paae jate hai
 Some hydrozoi jellyfish, or hydromedusae, are also found in fresh water; Freshwater species are one inch in diameter, colorless and do not sting

 These are large, often colorful jellyfish, commonly found in coastal areas around the world
 apane vyapak arth main, shabd jelifish aam taur par sangh tinophora ke sadasyon ko nirdisht karata he
 Although not closely related to the Niderian jellyfish, the tinophore free-swimmers are planktonic carnivores, which are generally transparent or translucent and present in shallow to deep parts of all oceans of the world
 sher ayaal jelifish sarvaadhik vikhyath jelifish hai or vivaadaaspad taur par duniya kaa sabase lanbaa jaanavar he
 Since jellyfish are not actually fish, the term jellyfish is considered a misnomer and American public aquariums have popularized the use of the words jelly or sea jelly instead
 kai anya jelifish ko, jo ek sadi se bhi zyaada samay se aam prachlan main he, utana hi upyogi or suramya maanate hai or jelly se zyaada is shabd ko pasand karte hai
 The term jellyfish is used to denote several different types of niderion, all of which have a basic anatomical appearance resembling an umbrella, including scyphozoi, storozoi, hydrozoi, and cubozoic organisms
 kuch pathyapustaken or website scyphojoi ko "asli jelifish" ke rup main sanderbhit karti hai
 In its widespread use, some scientists, when referring to jellyfish, sometimes include members of the association Tinophora

 "bloom" aam taur par chote kshetra main ekatrit hone vaale jelifish ke bade samooh ke liye prayukt hota he, par jinamein samay ghatak bhi shaamil ho saktaa he, jo mausami badhotaree yaa apeksha se adhik sankhya main hote hai
 Jellyfish "erupt" by their life-cycle nature, often produced by their perpetual polyps upon sunlight and plankton growth, causing them to appear suddenly and often in large numbers, even when the balance of the ecosystem Is made up "jhund" kaa upyog ek prakaar se saath rahane kii sakriy kshamta kaa sanket detaa he, jaise ki orelia, moon jelly kii kuch prajatiyaan pradarshit karti hai
 Many jellyfish have a second part of their life cycle, which is called the polyp phase
 jab ekal nishechit andey se utpann ek polip stolon kahalaane vaale utakon ke reshon dwaara ek-duusare se jude, anek polip gucchh main viksit hote hai, to unhen "sanghajivi" kaha jaataa he
 Some polyps never proliferate and are referred to as "unicorn" subcastes
 jelifish main vishesh pachan, paraasaran-niyantrak, kendriya tantrika, shwasan, yaa raktavahi pranaliyaan nahin hoti hai
 They digest using the gastric-lining of the gastric-vascular cavity, where nutrients are absorbed
 unhen shwasan pranali kii jarurat nahin he kyonki unki twachaa itani patali hoti he ki sharir visaran dwaara oxikaran karata he
 They have limited control over movement, but can move through the contraction-pulsing of their bellied body using a hydrostatic skeleton; Some species actively swim most of the time, while others remain inactive much of the time
 jelifish 90% jal se sanghatit hote hai; unki chhatari kii adhikansh maatra shleshiya saamagree misogliya naamak-jelly-se bani hoti he, jo upakalaa koshikaon kii do paraton dwaara ghiri hoti he, jo ghanti, yaa sharir ke chhatra or upachhatra ko banaate hai
 Jellyfish do not have a brain or central nervous system, but rather a loose network of nerves located in the epidermis, which is called the "neural network"
 ek jelifish apane tantrika jaal ke madhyam se anya jantuon ke sparsh sahit vibhinn uddipano ko jaanata he, jo phir jelifish ke sharir ke ghere main sthit ropalial lapet ke zarie, puure tantrika jaal or vartual tantrika valay ke ird-gird anya tantrika koshikaon ko aaveg prasarit karata he
 Some jellyfish also have eyespots: light-sensitive organs that do not make pictures, but which can detect light and determine the top and bottom of the water surface, reacting to sunlight
 ye aam taur par varnak bindu netrak hote hai, jinaki kuch koshikaayen ranjit hoti hai
 The presence of oceanic eruptions in response to prey availability and increased temperature and sunlight is generally seasonal
 mahaasaagar kii dhaaraon kaa jhukaav jelifish ko bade jhund yaa "prasphuton" main ekatrit karne kii ore hota he, jisamen saikadon yaa hajaaron jelifish rahati hai
 In addition to occasionally being concentrated by ocean currents, eruption can also result in unusually high populations in a few years
 prasphuton nirmaan ek jatil prakriya he jo sagar kii dhaaraon, poshak tatwon, taapmaana, parbhakshan or oxigen sandratha par nirbhar he
 Jellyfish are better able to survive in water with less oxygen than their competitors and thus can thrive on plankton without competition
 jelifish lavniya jal se bhi labhanvit ho sakate hai, chunki lavan jal main adhik iodine hota he, jo polipon ko jelifish main badalane ke liye aavashyak he
 Rising sea temperatures due to climate change may also contribute to jellyfish eruption, as many species of jellyfish are better able to survive in warm waters
 jelifish kaafii bade prasphutnon main rahane kii sambhaavna he or prayek main yah 100, 000 tak pahunch saktaa he
 Apart from the "imprint" in people's memory, there is little data available about changes in the global jellyfish population over time
 vaigyanikon ke paas aitihaasik yaa vartmaan jelifish aabaadi kaa bahut kam parimanatmak data uplabdh he
 Recent speculations about jellyfish populations are based on "past" data
 jelifish prasphuton aavriti main vaishvik vruddhi maanviya prabhaav se utpann ho sakati he
 In some places jellyfish may fill ecological niches that were previously occupied by more aquatic organisms, but noted that this hypothesis lacks supporting data
 jelifish shodhakarta marsh yangabluth aage spasht karte hai ki "jelifish ek hi prakaar ke yuva or vayask machhlee ke shikaar par poshan karte hai, isliye yadi machhlee ko sameekaran se hataa diya jaae, to jelifish dwaara vah jagah lene kii sambhaavna he
 " kuch jelifish aabaadiyaan, jinhone pichley kuch dashakon main spasht vruddhi darshaayi he, anya prakritik vaas se aane vaale "aakraamak" prajati ke hai: udhaaharan main shaamil hai kaala sagar or caspian sagar, baltic sagar, misr or israel ke purvi bumadhya samudr tat or mexico kii khadi kaa america tat
 aakraamak prajati kii aabaadi teji se vistaarit ho sakati hai kyonki unke vikaas ko rokane ke liye aksar nae awaas main koi prakritik shikari maujuud nahin rahete hai
 Such bursts do not necessarily reflect overfishing or other environmental problems
 vardhit poshak tatv, jiskaa shrey krishi bahaav ko diya jaataa he, jelifish ke prachurodbhavan ke purvavritt ke rup main bhi uddhrut kiye gaye hai
 Monty Graham of the Doffin Island Oceanographic Laboratory in Alabama states that "ecological systems, which have high levels of nutrients
 

 sookshm jeevon ke liye poshan pradaan karti hai, jinase jelifish aahaar grahan karte hai
 Water where there is hygiene often results in lower oxygen levels, favoring jellyfish since they can tolerate less oxygenated water than fish
 yah tathy ki jelifish bad rahe hai is baat kaa sanket he ki paristhitiki tantra main kuch ghatit ho rahaa he
 " namibia ke samudri tat se dur sagariya jivan ke namoonay dwaara pataa chalata he ki pichley kuch dashakon main is kshetra main baari machhleemari ke falswaroop, jelifish jaev maatra machhlee se aage nikal gai he
 Areas most seriously affected by jellyfish include the northern Mexico Gulf, about which Graham says "moon jellies have formed a type of synovial mesh that extends from one end of the bay to the other
 " Jellyfish eruption causes problems for mankind
 sabase spasht maanav dank hai or samudr taton par paryaton main giravat aati he
 Other serious symptoms are destruction of fish nets, poisoning or crushing of caught fish, consumption of fish eggs and small fish
 avrodh bhi kai samasyaon ko paidaa karata he jisamen shaamil he parmaanu bijli sanyantr or vilwanikaran sanyantron ko band karnaa, saath hi jahaajon ke injanon main baadha or sabase badi prajati nomura jelifish dwaara naavon ko ulataanaa
 Many jellyfish go through two different life history stages during their life cycle
 pehla polipid charan he, jab jantu poshak sparshakon ke saath ek chote danthal kaa aakaar grahan karata he; yah polip sthanbaddh ho saktaa he, jo bedon yaa naav ke tal jaisi nichali sataha yaa isi tarah ke adhbstar par jeeta he, yaa vah mukt-tairta hua yaa mukt-jivi plavak ke chote tukdon yaa virale hi, machhlee yaa anya aksheruki jeevon se judaa hota he
 The polyp usually has a mouth surrounded by upward tentacles similar to anthozoi as well as small polyps close to the union nideria
 polip ekaaki yaa sanghajivi ho sakate hai or kuch vibhinn tareeqon se alangik taur par, anek polip utpann karte hue prasphutit hote hai
 Many are very small, measured in millimeters
 duusare charan main, chote polip alangik taur par jelifish utpann karte hai, jinamein se prayek medusa ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Small jellyfish swim away from the polyp and then grow and feed on plankton
 medusa main trigyi samamik, chhatari ke aakaar kaa sharir hota he jo ghanti kehalaata he, jo saamanytah shikaar pakadaney vaale ghanti ke kinare ke chote ubhaar jaise-simavarti sparshakon se yukt hota he
 Some species of jellyfish do not have a polyp part in their life cycle, but they pass on to the next generation of jellyfish through the direct development of fertilized eggs from jellyfish
 jelifish ekalingashrayi hai, arthath ve aam taur par nar yaa maadaa hai 
 In most cases, both release sperm and eggs into the surrounding waters, where the eggs are fertilized and mature into a new organism
 kuch prajatiyon main, shukranu maadaa ke munh main tair kar maadaa ke sharir ke bheetar andey nishechit karte hai jahaan ve vikaas ke praarambhik daur main maujuud rahete hai
 In moon jelly, eggs settle in pits of oral arms, which form a temporary children's chamber for developing planula larvae
 nishechan or praarambhik vikaas ke baad, planula naamak kitdimbh rup viksit hota he
 The planula is a small larva surrounded by follicles
 yah thos sataha par jam jaataa he or polip ke rup main viksit hota he
 The polyp is shaped like a cup with a face surrounded by tentacles, which looks like a small ocean
 vruddhi antaraal ke baad, polip prasphutit dwaara alangik rup se prajnan shuru karata he or scyphosoa main yah khandit polip, yaa skyphistoma kehalaata he
 New scyphistomes may arise by proliferation or new immature jellies called ephyra may be formed
 kuch jelifish kii prajatiyaan medusa str se sidhe prasphuton dwaara nae medusa utpann kar sakate hai
 The eruption sites vary by species; Ranges from tentacles, bulbs to manubrium, or hydromedusae
 Some species of Hydromedusae breed by fission
 jelifish kii anya prajatiyaan sabase aam or mahatvapurn shikari jelifish main se hai, jinamein se kuch jelly ke visheshgy hai
 Other predators include tuna, sharks, swordfish, sea turtles and at least one species of Pacific salmon
 Sea birds sometimes pick up symbiotic crusts of jellyfish bells near the sea surface, essentially feeding on these waterfowl or small jellyfish nutrients of crab and prawns
 jelifish kii jivanavadhi aam taur par kuch ghanton se lekar kai maheenon ke bich hoti he
 Life-span and maximum size vary by species
 ek asaamaanya prajati ke 30 varshon ke lambey samay tak rahane kii soochna he
 Turitopsis doherney may be effectively immortalized as another species, T
 nutricula, due to its ability to differentiate between medusa and polyp and thus avoid death
 sabase bade tateey jelifish 2 se 6 maheene tak jivit rahete hai, jis dauraan ve ek yaa do millimetre se badhkar vyas main kai centimetre ho jate hai
 They eat continuously and attain adult size quite rapidly
 vayask aakaar tak pahunchane ke baad, paryaapt bhojan ho to jelifish har din andey dete hai
 In many species, undercurrent is controlled by light, so the entire population lays eggs at the same time of day, often in the morning or evening
 keval rizostome varg se sambandhit scyphoxn ko bhojan ke liye pakadaa jaataa he; 85 prajatiyon main se lagbhag 12 ekatrit kiye jate hai or antarrashtriya bazaaron main beche jate hai
 Most aggregation occurs in Southeast Asia
 rizostome, vishesh rup se china main ropilema esculenium or sanyukt rajya america main stomolofas miligris ko pasand kiya jaataa he kyonki unke bade or adhik kathor sharir kii vajah se tathaa unka vish maanvon ke liye hanikaarak nahin he
 Traditional processing methods performed by the Jellyfish Master include a 20- to 40-day multi-step process, in which after removing the gonads and mucous membranes, the umbrella and oral arms are processed, and compressed, with a mixture of salt and alum
 prasanskaran taralata, durgandh or vikrut karne vaale sookshmjivon ko kam kar detaa he or jelifish ko "kurkura or khasta gathan" utpann karte hue shushk or amleey banaata he
 Jellyfish prepared in this manner maintain 7-10% of their original weight and the processed product contains about 94% water and 6% protein
 tazaa sansaadhit jelifish main safed, malaaidaar rang hota he jo lambey samay tak bhandaaran ke dauraan pile yaa bhure rang main badal jaataa he
 In China, processed jellyfish are soaked overnight in water and desalinated and cooked or eaten raw
 vyanjan ko aksar kaat kar tel, soya sos, sirka or chini se taiyaar kiya jaataa he, yaa subjiyon ke saath salad ke rup main parosa jaataa he
 In Japan, salt-planted jellyfish are washed, sliced into strips and served as an appetizer with vinegar
 vilwanikrut, khaane ke liye taiyaar utpaada bhi uplabdh hai
 To export to Asia by the fisheries, the American cannonball jellyfish, Stomolophus milligris, has been introduced near the South Atlantic coast of the United States and into the Gulf of Mexico
 1961 main, princeton vishvavidhyalay ke osamu shimomura, jab jelifish kii is prajati dwaara jaivpradipti ke kaarak photoprotein par adhyayan kar rahe the, tab unhone bade or prachur hydromedusa equoria victoria se haraa pratideept protein or equorin naamak ek anya jaivpradipt protein ko nikaala
 teen dashak baad, duglas prashar, woods hole samudr-vigyaan santhaan ke ek pasch-doctoret vaigyanik ne GFP ke liye anukram nirdhaaran or jin clon kiya
 Soon Martin Chalfi of Columbia University explored how GFP could be incorporated into other cells or organs as a fluorescent marker of genes
 california vishvavidhyalay, san diego ke roger sian ne baad main GFP kaa rasinic taur par jod-tod kiya taaki marker ke rup main istemaal karne ke liye anya pratidipti rang hasil kar saken
 2008 main, shimomura, chelfi or sian ne GFP par apane kaam ke liye rasayan shaastra main nobel puraskaar jeeta
 Man-made GFP is now commonly used to illuminate which cells or tissues express specific genes
 anuvanshik ejineering takanic pasandida jin kaa GFP jin ke saath sangyojan karata he
 The assembled DNA is then inserted into the cell to produce the cell lineage or the entire animal carrying the gene
 koshika yaa jaanavar main, kritrim jin saamaanya jin ke samaan unheen utakon main or usee samay par janit hota he
 But instead of making normal proteins, the gene forms GFP

 pratidipti yah darshata he ki jin kahaan par vyakt hota he
 Jellyfish are also caught for their collagen, which can be used for a wide variety of applications, including the treatment of rheumatic arthritis
 kai deshon main jelifish ko machhleegharon main pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 Often the tank has a blue background and the animals are illuminated with lateral light, increasing the contrast between the animal and the background
 prakritik paristhitiyon main, kai jelly itane paardarshee hote hai ki ve lagbhag adrishy rahete hai
 Jellyfish are not adapted to closed spaces

 Professional demonstrations feature clear water flow, typically in round tanks, to prevent specimens from being trapped in corners
 montere be aquarium is uddeshy ke liye creicel kaa upyog karata he
 Jellyfish are becoming a popular trend in the domestic aquarium
 ab jelifish aquarium or jivit jelifish online khareednaa sambhav he
 It is also possible to add jellyfish aquariums for personal use
 sabhi jelifish nimatocist kaa upyog karte hue, jise nidocist bhi kaha jaataa he, apane shikaar par dank maarthe hai, joki nidosite kahalaane vaali vishisht koshikaon main sthit dank vaali sanrachana he, jo sabhi nideria kaa lakshan he
 Contact with jellyfish tentacles can cause millions of nematocysts to pierce the skin and inject venom, although the sting of only a few jellyfish species causes adverse reactions in humans
 jab ek nimatocist shikari yaa shikaar ke sampark se prerit hota he, to usamen tezi se 2,000 lbs / varg inch tak dabaav banaata he jab tak ki vah fat nahin jaataa
 nimatocist ke andar ek lans shikaar kii twachaa ko bhedata he or shikaar ke andar zehar bahane lagata he
 Touching or being touched by a jellyfish can be very uncomfortable, sometimes requiring medical help; The effect of sting can range from no effect to extreme pain and death
 jelifish dank ke prati pratikriya kii vyapak vibhinnata ke kaaran, anaavruth twachaa se jelifish ke sampark main na aane main hi budhimaani he
 Even seaside and dying jellyfish can sting when touched
 scyphosoai jelifish dank aksar asuvidhajanak hote he, haalanki aam taur par ye ghaatak nahin he, lekin vikhyath or vishesh rup se vishakt irukandji jaise varg cubosoa kii kuch prajatiyaan, yaa box jelifish ghaatak ho sakate hai
 Stings can cause anaphylaxis, which can lead to death
 isliye, peediton ko tatkaal pani se baahar ho janaa chahie
 Antibiotic ablution is also included in medical care
 gaiyr pechida jelifish dank ke liye praathmik sahaayta ke teen lakshya hai bachaav dal kaa chot se sangrakshan, nimatocist ko niskriy karnaa or rogi se jude sparshakon ko hataanaa
 bachaav-dal ko avarodhi vastra pahananaa chahie, jaise ki panty hoos, geele suut yaa puure sharir ke liye dank-abhedya suut
 nimatocist yaa dank koshikaon ko niskriy karne se or vish antarveshan se bachaav hota he
 Vinegar helps box jellyfish stings, but not Portuguese warrior stings
 ankhon par yaa uske aas-paas ke dank ke liye, ek tauliye ko sirka main bhigoen or ankhon ke aas-paas thapaka lagaaein, lekin ankhon se bachein
 yadi sirka anuplabdh ho, to namak kaa pani bhi upyog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 If there is a sting in the salty water, do not use fresh water, because the tonic changes may release additional toxin
 ghaav ko ragadne yaa alcohoul, spirit, ammonia yaa mutr ke upyog se bachein jo vish chhodane ko protsaahit karte hai
 By clearing jelly, tentacles and moisture from the place, nematocyst stimulation is further reduced
 prabhavit twachaa ko chaaku kii dhar, ustara yaa credit card se shev karne se baaqi nimatocist bhi hat sakate hai
 In addition to first aid, antihistamines such as diphenhydramine can control skin irritation
 twachaa main vish ko dur karne ke liye, dank par paak soda or pani kaa lep lagaaein or kapade se dhaken
 yadi sambhav ho, har 15-20 minute par lep dubaara lagaaein
 inamen se kisi ek kii uplabdhi tak barf zehar ko failane se roak saktaa he
 New discoveries about jellyfish and their popularity as a symbol of marine beauty and tenderness are reflected in television programs such as "jellyfish Innovation", an issue of the National Geographic Channel's documentary series Explorer, featuring scientists from Australia, Research conducted in Hawaii and Japan are included

 Chromosomes or chromosomes are fibrous nodules found in cells of all flora and fauna, which determine and transmit all genetic properties
 prayek prajati main gunasutron kii sankhya nishchit rahati hai
 The number of chromosomes in a human cell is 46, in pairs of 23
 iname se 22 gunasutra nar or maadaa main samaan or apane-apane jode ke samajaat hote he
 These are collectively called homologous chromosomes
 23wein jode ke gunasutra stri or purush main samaan nahin hote jinhe vishamjaat gunasutra kehete he
 In the structure of a chromosome, two substances are specifically incorporated - di en e hi anuvanshik padaarth he
 The structure of the DNA molecule consists of four organic compounds: two purines, two pyrimidines, one sugar-deoxyribose, and phosphoric acid
 purine main adinine or guanin hote he or pirimidine main thymin or cytosin 
 a molecule of DNA has two formulas, which ring around each other in a spiral form
 prayek di en e sutara main ek ke peeche ek chaaron carbonic samaakshar is kram se hote hai-thymin, cytosin, adinin or guanin, evam ve paraspar ek vishesh dhang se jude hote hai
 a unit of these four chambers and their related sugars and phosphoric acid molecule is a tetranucleotid and a DNA molecule is formed of several millennium tetranucleotids
 vibhinn praaniyon ke di en e kii vibhinnata kaa kaaran he - samaakshaaron ke anukram main antar hona
 DNA and a similar nucleic acid RNA combine with ultraviolet in the region of most 2,600 angstroms due to the presence of organic clear
 isi aadhaar par di en e kaa ek koshika sambandhi maatraatmak aagaman kiya jaataa he
 Two special types of centrosomes are found in beings
 ek to kuch deptra insecta main dimbhiy largranthi ke centrakon main paaya jaataa he
 These chromosomes are several hundred times longer and wider than ordinary chromosomes of the same species
 is kaaran inhen mahagunasutra kehete hai
 Their structure appears to be somewhat different from the simple centrosome and semisolid centers
 yahan ek gunasutra ke sthaan par ek anuprastha pankti aisi kanikaon kii hoti he jinamein abhiranjit hote kii yogyata adhik hoti hai
 All the corpuscles of many such transverse rows from one end of the chromosome to the other are identical and the corpuscles of the other rows have characteristics and differences
 in gunasutron ke adhik lambey hone ke kaaran yah samajha jaataa he ki inkaa purna rup se visarpelikaran hota he or kadachit protein kaa kuch badhaav bhi hota hai
 The reason for being wider is that a chromosome synthesizes another nucleus similar to its own
 saadhaaran avasthaa main samasutran ke samay ye donon sutara ek duusare se pruthak ho jate hai, parantu mahagunasutra main yah nahin hota
 The two sutras remain connected to each other
 mahagunasutra kii sankhya saadhaaran gunasutra kii sankhya kii aadhi hoti he, kyonki prayek sutara apane samaan duusare sutara se yugmit ho jaataa he
 This phenomenon is called somatic coupling
 jantuon main vicitra prakaar kaa ek or bhi gunasutra paaya jaataa he
 Its lampbrush is called chromosome
 ye gunasutra aise jantuon ke andon ke centrakon main paae jate hai jinamein andpit kii maatra adhik hoti he, jaise machhlee, ubhaychar, urag, pakshigan ityadi
 The chromosomes are made up of two coupled formulas similar to ordinary diplotene-diakinisis chromosomes
 donon yugmit sutara kuch sthanon par ek duusare se jude hote hai or shesh sthanon par ek duusaren se dur dur rahete hai
 These joints are considered kijma
 prayek sutara par, jisakon chromonima kehete hai, sthaan sthaan par vibhinn parisaan kii kanikas hoti hai jinako chromemrs kehete hai
 Each chromomier has a pair or more lateral clusters attached
 parshvapash bhi chromonima ke sadrush sutara kaa bana hota he, parantu iske chaaron ore rebonuclio-protein kanikas ekatrit ho jaati hai jisase ye sutara mote dikhaai dete hai
 Chromomers also breed with chromonima
 centrekaayen vishesh gunasutra par utpann hoti hai
 In most cells each chromosome has two integral clusters
 paripakv lingakoshikaon main ek kulak rah jaataa he
 Such animals and cells are said to be diploid, but some animals, especially plants, have more than two kulas of chromosomes
 yadi kisi dwiguneet praani ke cendraksutra dugune ho jaae, jisase uski koshikaaye main prayek sutara chaar chaar hon jaise, to aise praani kaa atopoliploid kehete hai
 If the chromosome of a diploid hybrid is doubled, such a creature is called an allopolyploid
 yadi ek dwiguneet praani kaa, jiskicendraksutra k1 k1 kha1 kha1 ga1 ga1 ityadi hai, kisi duusare praani se, jiske gunasutra k2 k2 kha2 kha2 ga2 ga2 ityadi hai, sankaran kiya jaae to uski santan ke gunasutra k1 k2 kha1 kha2 ga1 ga2 ityadi honge
 A1 a2 b1 b2 etc
 will be different from each other and there will not normally be coupling
 yadi is praani ke gunasutra dugune ho jaae to unki koshikaaye main k1 k1 k2 k2; kha1 kha1kha2 kha2; ga1 ga1 ga2 ga2, ityadi gunasutra honge
 This will be called allopolyploid
 poliploid main chaar se adhik kulak bhi ho sakate hai
 It is clear that the autopolyploid will produce quadruplexes in the zygotein state, because each of the four chromosomes of each type is present, and the coupling of the four formulas creates one quadrupole
 koshikavibhaajan ke samay prayek dhruv ko baraabar baraabar sankhya main gunasutra nahin milenge
 Often it happens that three threads reached a pole due to the breakdown of a quadrilateral and only one thread reached its opposite pole
 koshikavibhaajan ke ant par bane hue santati koshikaon main gunasutra yaa to adhik sankhya main honge yaa kam main or aise asantulan kaa parinaam yah hota he ki koshika mar jaati he
 This is why autotetraploids are much less fertile
 autotetraploid paudhe saadhaaran dwiguneet paudhon se bahut bade hote hai tathaa unke beej bhi bahut bade hote hai, jisase urvartaa kam hone par bhi ye gruhasthi ke liye adhik laabhadaayak siddh ho sakate hai
 By providing frost, or with the effect of some alkaloids, plant autopolyploids can be made
 elotetraploid main dasha iske vipareet hoti hai
 If the two primitive parent formulas are completely different from each other, the allopolyploid is functionally diploid and will be completely fertile
 jaise, yadi kisi sankar main k1 k2, kha1 kha2, ga1 ga2 se sutara sarvatha bhinn hon to aisa sankar bandhya hoga, parantu iske gunasutron ke dugune hone se yah avasthaa badal jaaygi

 The first branch of Cubism known as Analytical Cubism left a brief but influential as art movement for a brief period in France between 1907 and 1911
 The movement grew into its second phase under the name of synthetic cubism and played an important role until around 1919, until the Surrealist movement gained popularity
 angreji kala itihaaskaar duglas kupar ne apni moulik pustak da cubist ipak main cubism ke teen charnon kaa varnan kiya he
 According to Cooper, "early Cubism" was when the movement was initially developed in Picasso and Barack's studios, the second stage being called "high cubism", during which Juan Gris emerged as an important exponent and eventually Cooper " Last Cubism "called the last phase of the radical neo-thinker art movement

 prishthbhumi or vastuon kaa samtal dharaatal paraspar anupravesh kar uthlaa aspasht sthaan banaata he jo cubism kii khaas visheshtaon main se ek he
 English art historian, collector and author of The Cubist epuck, Douglas Cooper said of Paul Goguin and Paul Cézanne "both of these artists were particularly influenced by the formation of Cubism and by Picasso's paintings during 1906 to 1907"
 
 Cooper says that Les Demoiselles is often erroneously referred to as the first Cubist painting
 ve bataate hai, Some believe that Cubism's roots were found in two different trends in Cézanne's later works: first to break the dyed surface into smaller multilateral fields of colors, later on this mixed vision given by the telescopic approach
 Emphasis and other cylinders, through an interest in the simplification of natural forms of circles

 The invention of Cubism included the joint effort of Picasso and Barak, residents of Montmare, Paris

 Later Spanish Juan Gris also joined as an active participant in this movement
 After meeting in 1907, Barack and Picasso began work specifically on the development of Cubism
 picasso shuruyaat main vah shakti or prabhaav the jisane baraak ko 1908 tak fowism se alag hone ke liye raji kiya
 The two artists began working together from late 1908 and early 1909 until the First World War broke out in 1914
 andolan tezi se paris or puure europe main fail gaya
 French art critic Louis Vauxelles used the term "cubism" or "bijare cubics" for the first time after seeing a painting made by Barack in 1908
 unhone ise "chote cubs se bharaa hua" ke rup main varnit kiya he, jiske baad jaldi hi is shabd kaa vyapak upyog hone laga, haalanki shuru main in do rachanakaaron ne ise nahin apanaaya tha
 Art historian Ernst Gombrich described Cubism as "the most fundamental attempt to eradicate ambiguity and to force a text of the picture, which is a man-made construction, a tinted canvas"
 cubism maantaparnaase main anek kalakaaron dwaara apanaaya gaya or kala vyapaaree dainiel henry conviller ne ise protsaahit kiya, yah itani jaldi lokapriy ho gaya ki 1911 ke aalochakon dwaara kalakaaron ke ek "cubic skool" kaa zikr kiya jane laga
 However, many artists who considered themselves Cubists went in directions that were quite different from those of Barack and Picasso

 Both Pablo Picasso and Georges Barak, for example as their paintings Picasso's Ma Jolie, and Barack's The Portugese, to supply a tension between the reality outside the picture and the complex thinking on the visual language inside the frame

 Picasso was the chief analytical cubist but Barak was also prominent, who abandoned Fovism to work with Picasso in developing the Cubist dictionary
 synthetic cubism, cubism ke bheetar kaa doosraa mukhya andolan tha jise 1912 or 1919 ke bich picasso, baraak or juaan gris dwaara viksit kiya gaya tha
 Synthetic cubism is characterized to begin by introducing a wide variety of different structures, surfaces, collage elements, paper cols, and many mixed subjects
 yah kala ke kaary main ek mahatvapurn ghatak ke rup main coloz saamagree ko prachlit kiye jane kii shuruuaat thi
 Pablo Picasso's "steel Life with chair-canning", is considered to be the first work of this new style, which includes an oil cloth that covers the entire picture, including the framing of the rope and the subject, on an oval canvas to resemble the chair-canning
 Was printed bain ore upar "jeoyu" akshar hai, jo anek cubist chitron main dikhaai dete hai or "le jarnal " sheershak akhbaar ko sanderbhit karte hai
 Newspaper clippings were a common inclusion, with physical pieces of newspaper, sheet music, and similar items included in the collage

 Picasso and Barak had a friendly competition with each other and the inclusion of characters in tasks could be an extension of their game

 Compared to analytical cubism, less pure synthetic cubism has less planar shifts and less shading that creates flat space

 Various sources take the name of either Picasso's 1909 brass head of a Woman's Ka or the statue of Otto Gutfreund, shown in Prague in 1912, as the first Cubist statue

 It is also said of Wallace Stevens's "thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird" that shows how Cubism's multiple perspectives can be translated into poetry

 Cubism and its tradition, confined to earlier accounts of the history of art far beyond an art movement, have continued to inform the work of many contemporary artists

76175 Mahapura is a historic village in the Sanganer tehsil of Jaipur district, some ten kilometers from the capital of Rajasthan, to commemorate the eminent Maharanja Bishan Singh / Maharaja Vishnusinh with the other four villages, to the eminent scholar like Shivanand Goswami of Jagir
 Was gifted as mahapura anek kaarnon se bharat ke vilakshan graamon main se ek he, kyonki is gaanv ke saath itihaas or samskruti ke kai anjaane pahalu sambaddh hai
 The name of this village has its origin in the ancient Sanskrit texts like muhurta-ratna and sambheda-aryasaptashti which belong to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
 kuch shodhakartaaon kaa abhimath he ki dakshin main bahane vaali vegavati dhawalvarna penna nadi kii smriti main ek 'vishaal' / prasiddh / yaa mahimashali gaanv hone ke naate ise pehle 'mahapura' kaha gaya jo apbhransh upyog main aakar baad main mahapura kaha jane laga
 The first thing in the direction of being a glorious village is that Mahapura has been the work place of many Sanskrit-scholars
 Lakshminarayana's Tantric Deity served by Shivanand Goswami himself is in Mahapura
 ajmer road rashtriya rajmarg sankhya 8 ke najadik aradhya dev kaa pracheen lakshminarayan mandir aasapaas ke nivaasiyon ke liye atoot aasthaa kaa centre he

 After getting a glimpse of the royal style and precious accessories, some of the dreaded dacoits suddenly attacked Shivanandji's convoy
 The bravery and valor of the Bundela heroes eliminated those robbers, but the two Hardaul-chieftains, who were sent by the King of Orchha, received heroism in this violent war en route, with deep wounds
 shivanandji ne sakushal mahapura pahunch kar un divangat veeron ke liye shraadh / tarpan samet vidhivat sabhi karmkand puure kiye or unki smriti ko chirsthai banane ke liye, mahapura or bikaner, donon jagah jahaan vah rahe, hardaul veeron ke chabutare sthapit kiye
 in chabutaron par chaar sau barason tak ghi kaa deepak prayek sanjh goswami-parivaar jalaata rahaa tha
 Even today, in the goswami-kul, especially the Atreya clan, it is the custom to marry and visit the platform of Hardaul on every important auspicious occasion like marriage-marriage, mundan, yajnopavit, mother-child etc

 The villagers and bullock carts of the village used to walk on the raw road after resting and drinking cold water
 On coming on this road it seemed as if we had almost reached the village
 From time to time, one would find someone holding a familiar bicycle in his hand or coming in a bullock cart, who would say 'ram Ram' with great affection
 By the way, whoever was going through it, used to say 'ram Ram' to each other, whether it is known or not
