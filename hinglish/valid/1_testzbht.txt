1644 main aurangzeb kii bahan ek durghatana main jalakar mar gai
 Aurangzeb came to Agra three weeks after the incident, which caused his father Shah Jahan immense anger
 usne aurangzeb ko dakkan ke soobedaar ke ohade se barkhaast kar diya
 Aurangzeb could not come to the court for 7 months
 baad main shahjahan ne use gujarat kaa soobedaar banaaya
 Aurangzeb ruled smoothly and received the title of the same, he was made the governor of Badakhshan and Balkh region
 iske baad use multan or sindh kaa bhi governor banaaya gaya
 During this time he kept fighting with the Persians of Persia for control over Kandahar, but if he got anything other than defeat, it was his father's neglect
 1652 main use dakkan kaa soobedaar fir se banaaya gaya
 He fought against Golconda and Bijapur and at the decisive moment Shah Jahan withdrew the army
 isse aurangzeb ko bahut thes pahaunchi kyonki shahjahan aisa uske bhai daara shikoh ke kehane par kar rahaa tha
 In 1652, Shah Jahan fell ill and it seemed that Shah Jahan would die
 daara shukoh, shah suja or aurangzeb main satta sangharsh chalane laga
 Shah Suza, who had declared himself as the Governor of Bengal, had to go to the Arakan region of Burma, and in 1659 Aurangzeb, after arresting Shah Jahan at the Taj Mahal for the royal treasury, declared himself king
 daara shikoh ko rajdroh ke zurm main phaansi de di gai
 Aurangzeb never spent the royal treasury on his own
 mogul, khaaskar akbar ke baad se, gair-muslimon par udaar rahe the lekin aurangzeb unke thik ulat tha
 Aurangzeb resumed Jiziya, which Akbar had finished
 usne kashmiri brahmanon ko islam qabool karne par majaboor kiya
 The Kashmiri Brahmins sought help from Tegh Bahadur, the ninth Guru of the Sikhs
 teg bahadur ne iskaa virodh kiya to aurangzeb ne unhen faansee par lataka diya
 Sikhs still remember this day in their festivals
 aurangzeb ke shashan kaal main yuddh-vidroh-daman-chadhaai ityadi kaa tantaa laga rahaa
 The number and strength of the Sikhs in the West was increasing
 dakshin main bijapur or golkunda ko antat usne haraa diya par is bich shivaji kii maratha sena ne unako naak main dam kar diya
 Shivaji was arrested by Aurangzeb, but when Shivaji and Sambhaji escaped, it became a matter of great concern for him
 aakhir shivaji maharaja ne aurangzeb ko haraaya or bharat main maratha ne puure desh main apni takat badhai shivaji kii mrityu ke baad bhi maraathon ne aurangzeb ko pareshaan kiya
 Meanwhile, the Rajputs turned against him due to the policy of converting Hindus to Islam and they revolted soon after he died in 1707
 aurangzeb ke prashasan main duusare mughal badshaah se zyada hindu niyukt the or shivaji bhi inamen shaamil the
 It is a well-known fact about Mughal history that in comparison to other kings, Aurangzeb's reign was more part of Hindu administration
 aitihaasik tathy bataate hai ki aurangzeb ke pita shahjahan ke shasankaal main sena ke vibhinn padon, darbar ke duusare ahm padon or vibhinn bhugolic prashasnic ikaayiyon main hinduon kii taadaad 24 fisadi thi jo aurangzeb ke samay main 33 fisadi tak ho gai thi
 In the words of m Athar Ali, this fact is the strongest evidence against the notion that the emperor sided with the Hindu mansabdars
 aurangzeb kii sena main varisht padon par badi sankhya main rajput niyukt the
 Aurangzeb's attack against the Marathas and the Sikhs is viewed through religious spectacles but it is ignored when concluding that the Mughal army was often commanded by a Rajput commander in the war zone
 itihaaskaar yadunath sarkaar likhte hai ki ek samay khud shivaji bhi aurangzeb kii sena main manasabadaar the
 It is said that he was supposed to be the head of the Mughal Sultanate in South India but failed to realize his military prowess, Aurangzeb did not approve this appointment
 aurangzeb pavitra jivan vyateet karata tha
 In his personal life he was an ideal man
 vah un sab durgunon se sarvatra mukt tha, jo asia ke raajaaon main samanytah the
 He lived the Yeti-life
 khaane-pine, vesh-bhusha or jivan kii anya sabhi-suvidhaon main vah sanyam baratata tha
 While busy with the heavy work of administration, he used to take time to earn some money by copying the Quran and sealing the caps to meet his needs
 aurangzeb hi nahin sabhi madhyakaalin bharat ke tamaam muslim baadshahon ke bare main ek baat yah bhi kahi jaati he ki unamem se koi bhartiya nahin tha
 At one level, this is childish and meaningless because the concept of nation did not exist anywhere in 17th century India
 haalanki iske baad bhi yah baat kam se kam aurangzeb ke maamle main lagu nahin hoti
 This Mughal emperor was a staunch upper-class Hindustani
 iskaa sidhaa tark yahi he ki uskaa janm gujarat ke dahod main hua tha or uskaa paalan poshan ucchwargeey hindustani pariwaron ke bacchon kii tarah hi hua
 The Braj language and its literature were always patronized throughout the Mughal period and this tradition continued even during the rule of Aurangzeb
 colombia uniwarsity se judi itihaaskaar ellison bush bataati hai ki aurangzeb ke darbar main braj ko protsaahan dene vaala maahaul tha
 The king's son Azam Shah had a keen interest in Braj poetry
 braj sahitya ke kuch bade naamon jaise mahakavi dev ko usne sangrakshan diya tha
 Vrind, another great poet of the same language, was also employed in Aurangzeb's administration
 mughalkaal main darbar kii aadhikarik lekhan bhashaa farsi thi lekin aurangzeb kaa shashan aane se pehle hi badshaah se lekar darbariyon tak ke bich prachlit bhashaa hindi-urdu ho chuki thi
 This can also be understood from Aurangzeb's letter he wrote to his 47-year-old son Azam Shah
 badshaah ne apane bete ko ek kila bhent kiya tha or is maukey par nagaade bajwane kaa aadesh diya
 In a letter to Azam Shah, Aurangzeb has written that when he was a child, he loved the voice of the drums and often said, 'babaji dhan-dhan!' It can be said from this example that Aurangzeb's son used to talk to his father in the then prevalent Hindi
 samraat aurangzeb ne islam dharm ke mahatv ko sweekaarte hue ‘quran’ ko apane shashan kaa aadhaar banaaya
 He prohibited kalma khudvana on coins, celebrating the festival of nauroz, cultivating hemp, singing and playing etc
 1663 i
 main sati pratha par pratibandh lagaaya
 Charged the pilgrimage tax again
 apane shashan kaal ke 11 varsh main ‘jharokha darshan’, 12wein varsh main ‘tuladaan pratha’ par pratibandh laga diya, 1668 i
 main hindu tyohaaron par pratibandh laga diya
 In 1699 AD, he ordered the destruction of Hindu temples
 bade-bade nagaron main aurangzeb dwaara ‘muhatsib’ ko niyukt kiya gaya
 In 1669, Aurangzeb broke the 'vishwanath Temple' of Benares and the 'keshav Rai Mandir' of Mathura
 usne sharia ke viruddh liye jane vaale lagbhag 80 karon ko samaapt karvaa diya
 These included local taxes called ‘raidari’ and ‘pandari’ also known as ‘abwab’
 aurangzeb ‘daarul herb’ ko ‘daarul islam’ main parivartit karne ko apana mahatvapurn lakshya maanata tha
 In Aurangzeb's time, pilgrims coming to Brij were heavily taxed, Jiziya tax was re-imposed and Hindus were converted to Muslims
 us samay ke kaviyon kii rachanaaon main aurangzeb ke atyaacharon kaa ullekh he
 The Jaziya tax levied by Aurangzeb was at that time
 akbar ne jajia kar ko samaapt kar diya tha, lekin aurangzeb ke samay yah dobaaraa lagu kiya gaya
 Jaziya was different from normal taxes that non-muslims had to pay
 iske teen str the or iskaa nirdhaaran sambandhit vyakti kii aamadani se hota tha
 There were some exceptions to this tax
 garibon, berozegaron or shaareerik rup se ashakt log iske daayre main nahin aate the
 Apart from these, Brahmins and government officials who were at the top of the varna system of Hindus were also out of it
 musalamaanon ke upar lagane vaala aisa hi dharmik kar jakaat tha jo har amir musalmaan ke liye dena zaruri tha 
 Jaziya was certainly a biased tax system on the norms of modern values
 aadhunik raashtra, dharm or jati ke aadhaar par is tarah kaa bhed nahin kar sakate
 That is why when we look at the 17th century system on the scale of modern nations, it may seem very chaotic, but it was not so during Aurangzeb
 us daur main iske duusare udhaaharan bhi milte hai
 As the Marathas evicted the Mughals from a large part of the south
 unki kar vyavastha bhi takreeban isi str kii pakshpaati thi
 They used to collect zakat from Muslims and the Hindu population was out of any such tax system
 aurangzeb ne jitne mandir tudwaaye, usase kahin zyada banawaye the
 According to the famous historian Richard Eaton, demolition of temples was a rare occurrence in the Mughal period and whenever it happened it was political because of it
 iton ke mutabik vahi mandir tode gaye jinamein vidrohiyon ko sharan milti thi yaa jinaki madad se badshaah ke khilaaf sajeesh rachi jaati thi
 At that time there was no religious purpose to break the temple
 is maamle main kukhyat kaha jane vaala aurangzeb bhi sultanate ke isi niyam par chalaa
 Examples of temple demolition during his reign are very rare and there are political reasons at his root
 udhaaharan ke liye aurangzeb ne dakshin bharat main kabhi-bhi mandiron ko nishaanaa nahin banaaya jabaki uske shasankaal main zyaadaatar sena yaheen tainaat thi
 He definitely attacked some temples in North India like Keshav Rai temple in Mathura but the reason was not religious
 mathura ke jaaton ne sultanate ke khilaaf vidroh kiya tha isliye yah hamalaa kiya gaya
 In contrast, Aurangzeb also patronized temples for reasons
 yah uski un hinduon ko bhent thi jo badshaah ke vafaadaar the
 Historian Catherine Butler of King's College, London even says that Aurangzeb had built more temples than he broke
 catherine frank, em athar ali or jilaluddin jaise vidwaan is taraf bhi ishaara karte hai ki aurangzeb ne kai hindu mandiron ko anudaan diya tha jinamein banaras kaa jangam baadi math, chitrakoot kaa balaji mandir, elahabaad kaa someshwar nath mahadev mandir or guwahati kaa umanand mandir sabase jane-pahachaane naam hai
 In the period in the Mughal period, the talk of breaking the temples is so much in vogue, there is no special mention of this in the Hindus
 tark diya ja saktaa he ki us daur main aisa karnaa khatre se khaali nahin rahaa hoga, lekin 18veen shatabdi main jab sultanate khatm ho gai tab bhi is baat kaa kahin zikr nahin miltaa
 In the past, the issue of the demolition of Hindu temples by Mughal rulers became hot in India in the 1980s-90s
 aurangzeb ko kattarpanthi sabit karne kii koshish main ek bada tark yah bhi diya jaataa he ki usne sangeet par pratibandh laga diya tha, lekin yah baat bhi sahi nahin he
 Catherine explains that music was not banned in her court even in the Sultanate
 badshaah ne jis din rajgaddi sanbhali thi, har saal us din utsav main khub naach-gaanaa hota tha
 Some Dhrupadas include the name Aurangzeb, which suggests that music was patronized during his reign
 kuch aitihaasik tathy is baat kii taraf bhi ishaara karte hai ki vah khud sangeet kaa acha jaankaar tha
 In mirat-e-alam, Bakhtawar Khan wrote that the emperor had knowledge like musical legends
 mughal vidwaan fakirullah ne raag darpan naam ke dastavej main aurangzeb ke pasandida gayakon or vaadakon ke naam darj kiye hai
 Aurangzeb was loved by his sons Azam Shah and history tells that Shah had become an accomplished musician during his father's lifetime
 aurangzeb ke shasankaal main sangeet ke phalne-phoolne kii baat karte hue catherine likhti hai, ‘500 saal ke puure mughalkaal kii tulana main aurangzeb ke samay farsi main sangeet par sabase zyada tikaa likhi gayi
 However, it is true that towards the end of his life, Aurangzeb became more religious and kept away from music and music
 lekin upar hamane jin baton kaa zikr kiya he use dekhte hue yah mana ja saktaa he ki usne kabhi apni nijee ichha ko sultanate kii aadhikarik niti nahin banaaya
 In the late Aurangzeb, the Marathas had increased in strength in the south
 unhen dabaane main shahi sena ko safalataa nahin mil rahi thi
 Therefore, in 1683 Aurangzeb himself went south with the army
 vah rajdhani se dur rahata hua, apane shashan−kaal ke lagbhag antim 25 varsh tak usee abhiyaan main rahaa
 After ruling for 50 years, he died in Ahmednagar in the south on 3 March 1707 AD
 daulatabad main sthit fakir buruhanuddin kii qabr ke ahaate main use dafna diya gaya
 His policy created so many opponents, due to which the Mughal Empire itself came to an end

 Blind body BC From the third century BC One of the 18 Dada Bodies that developed in ancient Andhra country between the first century
 aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki uttari bharat se buddha dharm ke loponmukh hone par dakshin se saddharm kaa uddhaar hoga
 Among the bodies at that time, the blind body had a special significance
 iske praamukhya ke kaaran hi is samuhik naam se sammilit hone vaale anya nikaayon kaa naam bhi andhak pad gaya prathit hota he
 By the way, the following bodies are counted under it- vinay main shithil rahane vaale evam arhaton kii aalochana karne vaale bhikshuon ko 'mahasaandhik' kaha gaya tha
 It had special prominence of chaityaists, stupas and samitis
 inke prabhaav main viksit hone vaale andhakon or vapulyawaadiyon kaa vikaas hua
 Many of these ideas and theories were similar
 kathavatthu naamak buddha granth main mahavansh main varnit uparyukt andhak nikaayon or vapulyawaadiyon kii aalochana kii gai he
 The Buddhist Mahayana sect developed around the first century CE, in harmony with these bodies
 andhak nikaayon kaa mukhya centre aadhunik guntur jile kaa vartmaan dharnikot naamak sthaan tha
 At a site in Vinayapitaka, there is a description that Raj's palace became of gold due to the will of Pilindavach
 is prakaar ke chamatkaar ko dekhakar andhakganon ne yah vishwaas kiya ki ichha maatr se sadaiv or sab jagah riddhiyon kii uplabdhi evam prakaash sambhav he
 The blind people who believed in the siddhis believed Buddha to be extraterrestrials and also believed that Buddha did not come to the human world nor did Buddha preach religion
 vapulyawaadiyon se andhakon ke bahut se vichaar milte the jaise kisi vishesh abhipraay se maithun kii anugna
 With this, the importance of blind and malevolent bodies can be judged in terms of Mahayana and later developments

 The most common of these is the piano

 This organ often did not have a keyboard, but rather large buttons and levers that were often operated with the entire hand
 15veen sadi tak lagbhag sabhi keyboard main swaabhaavik se lekar prayek saptak tha
 Clavichord and harpsichord came into existence during the 14th century, of which clavichord probably came first
 18veen sadi main vyapak rup se piano ke adhigrahan karne tak harpsicord or klavicord donon kaaphi saarvajanik or lokapriy the, lekin iske aane ke baad dhire-dhire inaki lokapriyata kam ho gai
 The piano emerged as a revolutionary because a pianist could change the level of sound by changing the energy used in each key
 piano kaa puraa naam "gravicèmbalo con piano e forte" he jiskaa arth "madhur evam teevr ke saath harpsicord" lekin "piano-forte" ke rup main ise laghu kiya ja saktaa he, jiskaa italvi main arth "madhur-teevr" he
 Keyboard devices were additionally developed in the 20th century

 Inexpensive materials such as oak, walnut and soft wood are now used
 piano kii tarah dhwani karne vaale upkaran kii khoj ke kaaphi prayaas kiye gaye lekin iske aakaar or vajan kaa abhaav tha
 Electric pianos and electronic pianos were early efforts which, despite being a useful instrument in their own right, were not successful in reproducing the piano rhythms easily
 vidyut or electronic yantron ko isi avadhi ke dauraan viksit kiya gaya
 The synthesizer developed significantly in the 1960s and has continued since then
 sabase ullekhneey praarambhik synthesiser mung synthesiser he, jisamen analog circuitary kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 At the time, digital syntheses, using real piano samples, became currently common

 This bow consists of contradictory figures such as static-versatility in human work
 isiilie iskaa ek konaa sthirataa kaa or ek konaa chanchalta kaa pratik hota he
 Vasant is a friend of Cupid, so Cupid's bow is made of flowers
 is dhanush kii kaman swar viheen hoti he
 That is, when Cupid leaves the arrow from the command, there is no sound
 iskaa matlab yah arth bhi samajha jaataa he ki kaam main shaleenta jaruri he
 The arrow is the most important weapon of Cupid
 yah jis kisi ko bedhta he uske pehle na to aawaaj karata he or na hi shikaar ko sanbhalane kaa mauka detaa he
 This arrow has three corners in three directions, which are considered as symbols of the three worlds respectively
 inamen ek konaa brahm ke aadhin he jo nirmaan kaa pratik he
 It helps in the creation of the universe
 doosraa konaa vishnu ke aadhin he, jo onkaar yaa udar purti ke liye hota he
 It inspires man to do karma
 kaamdev ke tir kaa teesraa konaa mahesh ke aadhin hota he, jo makaar yaa moksh kaa pratik he
 It tells man the path of liberation
 yani, kaam na sirf sristi ke nirmaan ke liye jaruri he, balki manushya ko karm kaa maarg bataane or ant main moksh pradaan karne kaa rasta sujhata he
 Cupid's bow is aimed at the opposite sex
 isi vipareet lingi aakarshan se bandhakar puri sristi sanchalit hoti he
 One of the goals of Kamadeva is the work itself, which has been considered male, while the other is Rati, known as feminine
 kavach suraksha kaa pratik he
 The form of Cupid is so powerful that if it is not protected, it can bring disruption
 isiilie yah kavach kaamdev kii suraksha se nibaddh he
 That is, safe work is considered necessary for natural behavior, so that social evils and terrible diseases can be kept away
 jab rakshas tarakasur ne atank machaa diya tha tab tarakasur ke vadh ke liye devataayo ne kaamdev se vinati kii ki vah shiv va parvati me prem bana de kyoki tarakasur ko vah vardaan tha ki keval shiv va parvati kaa putr hi tarakasur kaa vadh kar saktaa he
 So Kamdev and Goddess Rati went to Mount Kailash to meditate on Shiva, but due to Kamdev's arrow, Shiva was distracted but Shiva got very angry and Shiva opened his third eye and consumed Kamdev and Rati Even when he was angry at his death, Rati cursed Parvati that no son would be born from Parvati's stomach
 yah shraap sunakar parvati dukhi ho gayi va shiv ne parvati ko samajhakar ki use dukhi nahi hona chaiye tathaa shiv nav parvati se vivaah kiya
 When the gods heard about this curse and about the death of Kamadeva, he became very upset, and the gods gave a boon to Tarakasura with deceit that only Tarakasura could be killed by the son born of Shiva's stomach
 phir shiv ne kaamdev ko zindaa kiya tathaa karthikey ne tarakasur kaa vadh kiya
 a detailed description of Cupid's nayan, eyebrow and forehead is found in the history stories
 unke nayanon ko baan yaa tir kii sangya di gai he
 Physically, the Nayans are considered to be exactly the same as their weapon arrows
 unki bhavon ko kaman kaa sangya di gai he
 They are quiet, but speak their own gestures
 inhen kisi sang yaa sahare kii bhi aavashyakta nahin hoti
 Kamadeva's forehead is similar to that of a bow, which has spasticity inside itself but is completely stable
 maathaa puure sharir kaa sarvocch hissaa he, yah disha nirdesh detaa he
 The elephant is considered the vehicle of Cupid
 vaise kuch shastron main kaamdev ko tote par baithe hue bhi bataaya gaya he, lekin ise mul avadharana main shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 The elephant is the only creature in nature that roams freely in all four directions
 maadak chaal se chalane vaala hathi teen dishaao main dekh saktaa he or peeche kii taraf halki si bhi aahat aane par sanbhal saktaa he
 Elephants can hear from all sides with their ears and can strike with their trunk in all four directions
 thik isi prakaar kaamdev kaa charitra bhi dekhne main aata he
 They roam freely in all four directions and are ready to drop arrows in any direction
 kaamdev kisi bhi tarah ke swar ko turant bhaanpane kaa madda bhi rakhte hai

 spider-woman, also known by its other names spider-gwen or The White Widow, is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics
 jaisan latur or robi rodrigage dwaara nirmit yah charitra pehali baar 2014 main age of spidervars # 2 main "spidervars" comic kahani shrunkhlaa ke ek bhaag ke rup prakashit hui thi, or ise aage chalakar "spidar-gwen" naamak shrunkhlaa main jari rakhaa gaya, jiskaa prakaashan 2015 main prarambh hua tha
 spider-woman is actually a variant of spider-man, and an alternate-universe version of the original Gwen Stacy
 jis brahmand main vah rahati he, use maarval comics main arth-65 kaha jaataa he
 In Earth 65, Gwen Stacey was bitten by a spider in place of Peter Parker, after which she became the Great spider-woman
 spidar-vuman ko apni shaktiyon or kshamtaaon ko baantne ke saath-saath peter ke vyaktitv or sangharshon ke banaaye rakhte hue darshaya gaya he
 Gwen Stacy was a good friend of Peter Parker's college, who was not known to be Spiderman
 gwen ke is charitra kii june 1973 main da amaiging spidar main # 121 main mrityu ho gayi thi
 While writing the "spiderverse" story series, writer Dan Slott first thought of creating Gwen, armed with Spider's powers
 unhone is bare main sampadak nik love ko bataaya, jinhone is charitra ke vikaas kaa jimmaa jaisan latur ko saunpa
 Jason Latur was not at first in favor of reviving Gwen, but eventually agreed, and then gave the character designing work to Robbie Rodriguez
 17 sitambar 2014 ko yah charitra pehali baar age of spidervars # 2 main najar aayaa, or tab se ise spidar-gwen naam se bhi pahachaanaa jaataa he
 Gwen Stacy is a student at Midtown High School who was bitten by a spider, and she became a spider-woman
 gwen stacy ke rup main vah apni saheliyon, mairi jine watasan, betty brant tathaa glori grant ke saath "mairi jine" naam ke ek band main drumer he
 As spider-woman, he first encounters Peter Parker, who becomes a lizard by using a chemical to get his revenge on some people
 gwen use parajeet kar chhod detii he, lekin chemical ke prayog ke kaaran peter kii mrityu ho jaati he
 Gwen's father, George Stacey, an officer in the New York Police Department, sets off to search for Peter's killers
 comic siries main spidar-gwen ke taur par vah kai khalnaayakon se ladati he, jinamein valchar, crevan tathaa harry osborn pramukh hai
 He encounters Matt Murdoch and Frank Castle the most
 apane dushmano ke atirikt vah kai superheroes ke saath bhi kaam karti he, jinamein captain america, read richards or peggi carter mukhya hai
 Baruth de Spinoza was a Dutch philosopher of Jewish descent
 unka parivartit naam 'benedict di spinoja' tha
 He showed remarkable scientific aptitude, but the importance of his works could be realized only after his death
 spinoja kaa janm holland main, yahudee parivaar main, san 1632 main hua tha
 He was reclusive, fearless and uninterested by nature
 apane vishwaason ko tyaagane ke liye unako lobh dikhaaya gaya, unki hatya kaa shadyantr rachaa gaya, unhen yahudee sampradaay se bahishkrut kiya gaya, phir bhi ve adig rahe
 Worldly life seemed to him like an intolerable disease
 at: usase mukti paane tathaa ishwarprapti ke liye ve baichaiyn rahete the
 Spinoza's most famous treatise is his 'ethics'
 kintu iske atirikt bhi unhone saat yaa aath granthon kaa pranayan kiya he
 Principles of Philosophy and Metaphysical Cogitations were published in 1663 and Tractatus Theologico Polyticus in 1670, without his name
 unke teen adhure granthtrectatus polyticas, trectatus di intelectus emagedateon, gramatices lingue hebrasi hai - jo unke mukhya granth athiks ke saath, unki mrityu ke uparaant usee saal 1677 main prakashit hue
 Many days later, another treatise, Tractetus Brevis de Dio, was published in 1858
 spinoja ke jivan tathaa darshan ke vishay main anek granth likhe gaye hai jinaki suchi spinoja in da lite ov vedant main di gai he
 The idea that matter can be a creation of matter, so ideology and expansion are matter, Spinoza protested
 dravya, swayamprakash or swatantra he, uski sristi nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, ideology and expansion, which are created, are not titles but degrees
 spinoja anishvaravaadi is arth main kahe ja sakate hai ki unhone yahudee dharm tathaa isai dharm main prachlit ishwar kii kalpana kaa virodh kiya
 Spinoza's substance or God is nirguna, formless and personless omnipresent
 kisi bhi prakaar ishwar ko vishisht rup dena usko simit karnaa he
 In this sense the God of Spinoza is similar to the Brahman of Advaita Vedanta
 jis prakaar brahm kii do oopaadhiyaan, naam or rup hai, usee prakaar spinoja ke dravya kii do oopaadhiyaan vichaar or vistaar hai
 These are not properties of matter
 brahm ke swaroopalakshan ke samaan dravya ke bhi gun hai jo uske swaroop se hi siddh ho jate hai, jaise uski adwitiyata, swatantraaa, purnataa aadi
 It is more aforementioned to call thought and extension not a virtue, because according to Spinoza they are charged by the intellect to understand the nature of matter
 is prakaar kii anant oopaadhiyaan spinoja ko maanya hai
 These titles of God are also infinite, but the infinitude of God is absolute and the infinity of these titles is relative
 ishwar jagat kaa srashta he, parantu is rup main nahin ki vah apni ichhashakti se sampurna vishwa kii rachana karata he
 To really impose a will in God is to limit it
 parantu iskaa yah arth nahin he ki ishwar swatantra nahin he; uski swatantraaa uski sarvanirpekshata he na ki swantatra ichha isi se spinoja sristi ko saprayojan nahin maanata
 The reason for the god world is in the same sense as the golden ornament or the sky triangle
 parantu iskaa yah arth nahin ki ishwar parivartansheel he
 The world is fictitious, but its basis is true God
 ishwar or jagat vibhinn hai, parantu vibhakt nahin
 Just as God does not have the willpower, in the same way there is no thing called free will in man
 vaastaviktaa yah he ki prayek vichaar kaa kaaran ek anya vichaar hua karata he at: koi bhi vichaar swatantra nahin he
 Also, the physical world is not affected by Spinoza's thinking
 kaary-kaaran-shrunkhlaa alag hai parantu donon ek hi dravya, he at: ve sambandhit maaloom padate hai
 In practice, Spinoza seems deterministic
 unka kahana he ki ichhashakti ke asweekaar karne se hamaare vyavhaar tathaa aachaar par prabhaav nahin padataa at: usase sarshak hona anaavashyak he
 The reality is that if we are determined that the work-cause-chain of the world is independent, then we will have great peace
 manushya tabhi tak ashaant rahata he jab tak uskosh kaary kaaran-shrunkhlaa main parivartan kii aashaa rahati he
 Belief in free will is our bond
 ichaswatantray kaa upyog ichaswatantray ke niraakaran ke liye karnaa chahie
 With the suppression of the will of the independent, the princely instinct and mental disorders are quenched and the mind is capable of divination
 jivan kaa param lakshya ishwar kii prapti he kyoki tabhi nityashubh kii prapti ho sakati he
 The attainment of God comes from loving God, but love does not mean sentimentality but emotionality
 isi se spinoja ne is prem ko bauddhik prem kaha he
 One meaning of divinity is that we do virtue for virtue, because wishing for reward in virtue of virtue is the creation of a bond
 jab hamaara man ishwarmay tathaa hamaara drushtikon nity kaa drushtikon ho jaataa he tab ham ishwar ke saath tadatmya kaa anubhav karte hai tathaa param shanti praapt karte hai
 In Spinoza's view, the virtuous form of God is also important
 jinka bauddhik str nicha he tathaa jinke man main sagun, saakaar ishwar kii kalpana se dharmbhaavna jaagrath hoti he unke liye yah kalpana atyant upyogi he
 It is better to believe in God than to realize God more than not to believe in God
 spinoja kaa vichaar sarvadharmanirpeksh tha, isi se aaj ke yug main logon kii drushti spinoja kii ore baar baar ja rahi he
 The Van der Waals equation is an equation of the state of gases which was introduced in 1877 by Van der Waals
 vaastavik gaisen, adarsh gas sameekaran kaa thik se paalan nahin karatin, jabaki vaan dar vals kaa sameekaran kaaphi seemaa tak vaastavik gaison ke vyavhaar kaa thik se varnan karata he

 gatisberg sambodhan america raashtrapati abraham linkan dwaara diya gaya ek bhaashan he jo america ke itihaas ke sabase yaadgaar bhaashanon main gina jaataa he
 It was read by Lincoln on Thursday, November 19, 1863, on the dedication day of the National Military Church in the city of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, when the American Civil War had ended four-and-a-half months, and the United States had split into two
 puraa bhaashan keval lagbhag do minute kaa tha, lekin usamen maanvon ke saamaan adhikaron or america swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa main uthaae gaye asulon ko unhone nae shabdon main doharaaya
 In English Lincoln said - Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation, so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure
 We are met on a great battle-field of that war
 We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live
 It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this
 But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow this ground
 The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract
 The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here
 It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they fought here have thus far so nobly advanced
 It is rather for us to be dedicated here to the great task remaining before us — that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion — that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, iskaa hindi anuwaad yah he - Today we are fighting a fierce war, to try whether this nation, or any nation which is so imagined and dedicated, can survive
 ham us jang ke ek mahaan yudhsthal2 par khadey hai
 We have come to offer a part of that land for their last sleep, who gave up their lives here so that the nation lives
 yahi thik he or yahi sahi he ke aaj ham aisa karen
 But, in the great minds, we cannot dedicate this land, we cannot make it sacred, we cannot justify virtue
 ve vir purush, jivit or mrit, jo yahan jujhe, isko itnaa pavitra bana chuke hai ki ham main isko kam yaa zyaada karne kii kshamta he hi nahin
 The world will not care much about what we say here today, nor will she remember it for long, but she can never forget what she did
 balki ham zindon par laazim he ke swayan us adhure kaary par samarpit hon jise yahan ladane waalon ne itani shaan se aage badhaayaa - ke un sammanit mriton se us dhyey ke liye arpan kii bhaavana len jis ke liye ve apana sarvasv arpit kar gaye - ke aaj yahan thaan len ke yah marane vaale vyarth nahin mare - ke yah raashtra, ishwar ke adheen, swatantraaa kaa ek nayaa janm legaa - or vah sarkaar jo janata kii ho, janata se ho, janata ke liye ho,3 is duniya se khatm nahin hogi
 Mountain plain island alborz praant iran ke 31 praanton main se ek he
 Its capital is the city called Karaj
 yah iran kii rajdhani tehran se 20 kimi pashchim main alborz parvaton kii nichali pahadiyon main sthit he
 The province was formed on 23 June 2010 by dividing the province of Tehran
 alborz praant main 4 shaharistaan hai - karaj, savozbolag , taaleqaan or nazarabad
 The province is the least populated province of Iran
 karaj shahar kaa ek drishy Imamzadeh Tahir Necropolis in Karaj taaleqaan band Taleqan Lake ek storage aria network ek dhaancha he jo ki remote computer upkarnon ko sarwar se is dhang se jodta he ki system sthaneey oparating system se judaa prathit hota he
 Although the cost and complexity of sans are decreasing, they are not commonly found outside large enterprises
 aitihaasik rup se, data centre pehle "SCSI discs saarini ko dweep bana kar pratyaksh rup se jude hue sangrahan ke rup main badalte hai, jinamein se prayek ek aplicoshan ko samarpit hota he or 'abhaasi hard drive' kii ek sankhya ke rup main dikhaai detaa he
 Basically, SAN connects such storage islands using a high-speed network
 aaparating system ek samarpit bina shering ke - LUNS kaa prayog kar ke apana file system banaate hai jaise ki ve sthaneey rup se swayan ke liye karte hai
 If more than one system tries to share luns, they will interfere with each other's work and corrupt data
 LUN par computaron ke bich data share karne kii kisi bhi yojana ke liye ek unnat samaadhaan kii aavashyaktaa he jaise ki SAN file system yaa clustard computing / gananaa
 Despite these issues, SAN storage capacity helps to increase usage as more than one server collects its personal storage space as a disk table
 SAN ke saamaanya upyogon main vyavhaarik data kaa praavdhaan bhi he jiske liye hard discs tak ucch gati block str tak pahunch aavashyak he jaise ki email sarwar, databes or atyaadhik prayog hone vaale fil sarwar
 Unlike a SAN, network attached storage uses file-based protocols such as NFS or SMB / CIFS where it is clear that storage is in a remote location and the computer requests a portion of the file tightening rather than a disk block
 haal hi main, NAS heads ne SAN sangrahan kaa NAS main roopantaran saral bana diya he
 h NAS or SAN ke bich antar hone ke baavjood, aise samaadhaan bananaa sambhav he jisamen donon takneekein shaamil hon, jaisaa ki chitra main dikhaaya gaya he
 Sharing storage makes store management simple and flexible as it does not have to change the location of wires and storage devices to transfer storage from one server to another
 anya laabhon main sarwar ko SAN se boot karne kii kshamta shaamil he
 This can cause bad servers to be changed quickly and easily as the SAN can be re-organized so the converted server can use the LUN of the server
 is prakriya main aadhe ghante kaa samay lagata he tathaa naye data kendron main teji se lagu kiya ja rahaa he
 Many emerging products are being designed to facilitate this and further increase this momentum
 udhaaharan ke liye, broked, ek risource manager naamak ek aplicoshan prastut karata he jisamen swachaalit dhang se sarwar ko boot of karne kaa praavdhaan he tathaa jisamen vishisht maamle main lod samay minute main mapa jaataa he
 Although this field of technology is still new, many see it as the future of enterprise data centers
 SAN atyaadhik prabhavi dhang se aapadaa prabandhan prakriya ko sakasham karte hai
 The SAN can access a second storage table located in a remote location over a period
 yah sangrahan main badlaav ko sambhav banaata he chaahe ise discs saarini niyantrak, sarwar software yaa visheshgy SAN upkaran dwaara karyanvit kiya jaye
 chunki lambi duuri ke sanchaar ke liye IP WAN sabase sasti vidhi he, atah IP or iscsi protocol ko fibre channel par viksit kiya gaya taaki IP network par SAN kaa vistaar ho sake
 The traditional physical SCSI layer could operate only a few meters away which was not enough to sustain a business in a disaster
 sanyukt rajya america main 11 sitambar ke hamale ke baad is SAN aplicoshan kii maang naatakeey rup se bad gayi he or sarbanes oxle or samaan kanoon se jude viniamak banane kii maang teji se bad rahi he
 The economic mobilization of disk tables has accelerated the development of many features including i / o caching, snapshotting, and volume cloning
 zyaadaatar sangrahan network sarwar tathaa discs drive upkarnon ke bich sanchaar ke liye SCSI protocol kaa prayog karte hai
 They do not use physical low level SCSI, instead new iscsi storage networks are used
 network banane ke liye anya nimna str protocol ke liye ek masping parat kaa prayog kiya jaataa he: The SAN often uses a Fiber Channel fabric topology - a specially designed infrastructure for storage-related communication
 yah NAS main prayukt ucch str protocol kii apeksha adhik tej tathaa vishwasaneey pahunch pradaan karata he
 The cloth is similar to the network segment used in local area networks
 ek vishesh fibre channel SAN kapadaa kai fibre channel swichon kii sankhya se mil kar banataa he
 Nowadays, all major SAN equipment vendors are also offering some form of Fiber Channel routing solution and these solutions are making SAN highly profitable by allowing data to pass through different layers of fabric, without mixing them
 ye samaadhaan mul protocol tattvon kaa prayog karte hai tathaa ucch str par pradarshit dhaanche bilkul bhinn hai
 They often enable mapping of Fiber Channel traffic over IP or SONET / SDH
 SAN fibre channel ke saath shuruuaati samasyaon main ek samasya yah thi ki vibhinn nirmaataaon dwaara nirmit switch or anya hardware puri tarah se anukool nahin the
 Although the original storage protocol FCP was always of very good quality, some programs at higher levels did not work well
 isi tarah, kai host oparating system duusare oparating system ke saath ek hi kapade ke bantwaare par kharaab pratikriya karenge
 Many solutions were introduced to the market before the standards were finalized and vendors have since invented several standards
 badi discs saariniyon kaa network hone ke kaaran SAN kaa mukhya rup se bade paimaane par, ucch pradarshan vaale udhyamon main sangrahan ke kaaryon main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 SAN equipment is relatively expensive and so Fiber Channel host bus adapters are rare in desktop computers
 ISCSI SAN praudyogiki ke dwaara antat saste SAN utpaadan kii ummiden hai, lekin aisa nahin lagata ki is praudyogiki kaa prayog udhyam data centre ke baahar kiya jayega
 desktop graahakon dwaara NAS protocol jaise ki SMB tathaa NFS kaa prayog jari rakhane kii ummid kii jaati he
 An exception to this may be considered remote storage replication
 video sampadan kaary samoohon main atyadhik data sthaanantaran dar kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Outside the enterprise market, this is an area that has benefited immensely from SAN
 prati node bandwidth ke upyog par niyantran, jise kabhi kabhi seva kii gunvattta ke rup main nirdisht kiya jaataa he, video kaary samoohon main vishesh rup se mahatvapurn he kyonki agar aparyaapt khuli bandwidth ho to yah puure network main saafe or praathamikta ke aadhaar par bandwidth kaa upyog sunishchit karata he
 Avid Unity, Apple's XSAN and Tiger Technology Meta SAN are specifically designed for video networks and provide this facility
 ek aisi prakriya jisamen taarkik sangrahan ko bhautik sangrahan se alag kiya jaataa he, sangrahan abhasikaran kehete hai
 Physical storage resources are collected in the storage pool from which logical storage is created
 yah upyogkarta ke data ke bhandaaran ke liye ek taarkik jagah pradaan karti he or vaastavik bhautik sthaan par masping kii prakriya ko paardarshee dhang se sambhalati he
 It is used in modern disk sarees using vendor-owned solutions
 haalanki, iskaa lakshya vibhinn vikritaon ke network par bikhri hui kai discs saariniyon ko ek ekaaki sangrahan upkaran main abhaasi rup se ikaitha karnaa he jiskaa prabandhan samaan rup se kiya ja sake

 Sultan Rahi or Sultan Khan was a Pakistani Punjabi actor from the Sultan of Pakistan film industry
 vah 1996 main goli markar hatya kar di gai thi
 
 duniya un logon se bhari hui he jo bahut hi kam or vinamr prishthbhumi se "vyakti" ban gayi or unke sambandhit kshetra kii duniya par shashan kiya
 If we uncover the pages of film history, we have a long list of such celebrities but among all, Sultan Rahi has a very unique and important place
 unhone camera trollies, boom oparator yaa film studio ke kisi bhi chote kaam ko dhakka karke apana film karier shuru kiya or film nayak ke rup main kala ke pradarshan kii chotii or oonchaaiyon par pahunchaa jo kai pramukh abhinaytaon kaa sapana he
 Sultan Rahi was the Sultan of the film, his name was a guarantee for the success of any film, a necessary name in any film especially in the seventies Punjabi film, mid eighties and nineties, but he always humbled himself Used to present as he used to be during his days of struggle
 sultan raahi ne lagbhag saat sau se adhik filmon main abhinay kiya he ki unke naam ko 'ganis book of world records' main shaamil kiya gaya tha, jo ki sabase zyada feechar filmon main mukhya bhoomika ke rup main abhinay ke liye he
 Sultan Rahi will never be forgotten as a religious, awami, liberal, hard-working and on-earth showcase actor and to revive the initiative here is a tribute to such a dynamic and versatile actor of Pakistan film industry
 1938 main, sena ke ek subedaar major abdul majid ne apane bete ke chehre ko dekhakar aashirwad diya, unhone kalpana kii ki ek din vah logon ko raja ke rup main shashan karegaa taaki unhone ise 'sultan mohammad khan' naam diya
 As a result of this, it was proved that he ruled the film industry of Pakistan not only as a king but also in the hearts of millions of people who understand Urdu and Punjabi languages
 sena main hone ke baad unhen shahar se shahar main tainaat kiya gaya tha lekin adhiktar ve rawalpindi main rahe
 The environment of the house was purely Islamic, being a religious family arranged for Sultan Khan's primary school in Rawalpindi, so this aspect has a major role in the basic composition which was clearly visible and life till his death
 i survived saat saal kii umr main, sultan, courian abdul sattaar kii dekharekh main rawalpindi ke golmandi kshetra ke masjid se quran ke tees sipars ko padhanaa sikhta tha iske alaava, sultan usee masjid main paanch baar aazan kahata tha
 Sultan Khan had two brothers and one sister, the elder brother Sultan died before birth and the second brother was four years old when his sister died after the death of his second son
 parinamswaroop vah apane mata-pita vishesh rup se apane pita kii neeli ankhen thim, jo chaahate the ki sultan ko vaayu sena main shaamil hona chahie
 Despite being very religious and a son of the army, he was very keen on sports so he actively participated in school sports matches as a regular member of the hockey team and in the same regard he also visited Lahore with his mother
 sultan khan kaa pita apane bete ke adhyayan or shiksha ke bare main bahut sakht tha, unhone kabhi bardaasht nahin kiya ki unke bete ne kabhi bhi apane skool varg main se kisi ko kho diya
 But the Sultan was not interested in his education, instead he used to lean towards physical activities like sports, hockey and football
 apane bachapan ke dauraan sultan ko cinema main film dekhne kaa kabhi anubhav nahin tha, lekin jaisaa ki unhone apane saakshaatkaar main kai baar ullekh kiya he ki bachapan se vah ek chupa hua abhinayta tha, isliye skool ke dinon main vah apane saamaanya jivan, kaam or atirikt samay ke dauraan kaam karata tha
 Supporting activities sultan raahi ne do baar shaadi kii, jab vah baagh i jinna main kagij ke phool naamak manch ke naatak main pradarshan kar rahaa tha
 This was his struggling period, so he was facing problems regarding his residence
 apni vittiya sthiti ko samajhane vaale apane sah-kalakaar sohil fajali, jo ek hi manch par khel rahe the, unhen aamantrit kiya or 102-si, model toun, lahore main unke nivas ke liye sultan raahi ko laayaa
 Mr
 Jamil Qureshi who was also a cousin of film journalist and film writer Sohail Fazli was living with him
 kuch samay baad sultan raahi ne ek atirikt ke rup main filmon main kaam karnaa shuru kiya or badale main unhone kuch paise milanaa shuru kar diya
 During this period Sultan Rahi's friend succeeded in getting married in a more humble family after a very simple wedding ceremony
 lekin kuch dinon ke baad, unhone sultan raahi kii vittiya sthiti ke aadhaar par matbhed viksit kiye or kuch maheenon ke baad ve hameshaa ke liye alag ho gaye
 Additional from Hyder Sultan Fighter and then as a side villain Sultan Rahi worked very hard and after playing a side villain role in Jumma Junj Naal, Sultan Rahi was able to get one hundred rupees per shift for fifty rupees, So he started getting enough money to take care of himself and his family
 vah apane purvajon ke shahar rawalpindi main waapas chalaa gaya jahaan unke mata-pita ne unhen apane parivaar ke bich shaadi kar lee, or sultan raahi ko ek aagyaakaari bete kii tarah apni pasand or unki patni ko bina kisi jhijak ke sweekaar kiya
 Finally, he returned to Lahore alone after spending some time
 yahaan lahore main, unki patni ne unke liye ek acchhee kismat laai or unhone filmon main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane kii shuruyaat kii
 On his next visit to Rawalpindi, he brought his wife to Lahore and resided here in Lahore, where God Almighty blessed them both with five children, three sons named Babar Sultan, Tariq Sultan
 , haidar sultan, or samina or sima unki do betiyaan thim haidar sultan apane ekmaatr baccha the jo shobij main shaamil ho gaye the or unke jivan main sultan raahi apane ek film babbra main 1929 main haidar sutalan pesh karne main sakasham the, lekin haidar ne khud ko film abhinayta ke rup main sthapit karne se pehle, sultan raahi kaa dukhad nidhan filmon kii sankhya ko prabhavit karne par prabhavit hue lekin iske saath hi apane kariyar par bhi asar padaa lekin, haidar sultan ko choti screen par dekha jaataa he
 In the later part of his life he moved his family from Pakistan to Chicago, USA for better education of his siblings
 1996 main, vah apane parivaar ko apane id ke saath bitaate the lekin durbhaagya se vah islamabad main visa aupchaariktaaon ke baad lahore lautne ke baad aisa nahin kar paa rahe the, gurjarawala par hatya kar di gai thi
 It is worth mentioning here that the true Sultan of cinema, some schools think that they blame Sultan Rahi
 Gundsa culture, in the name of films on castes and immoral characters, the faults of society were exacerbated and exacerbated by them
 


 Yes this may be true but in our opinion one has to release that the film is a fantasy, when the viewer enters the cinema, he wants the entertainment which is finalized before he enters the cinema ] At the end of the theater and the show, if the film has not come to its standard or expectation, it will never return and if it works it will not only return but will wait fully 
 


 As much, cinema is taken as a magic world, so it should be taken as such
 

 filmon par koi darshanik bahes nahin
 
 If someone has started exploring American culture in the blockbuster film Avatar, you can think about his state of mind
 
 iske darshakon kaa vikalp he ki ve kis cheez ko dekhnaa chaahate hai kuch gambhir naatak, fiction, kamedi, yuddh filmein, science fiction, cartoon anemeshan, desh, couboy western film, har koi apana swaad letaa he, anya ise itnaa beparwaah maan sakate hai, lekin isaki pasand 


 or hamen sammaan or sammaan karnaa chahie
 

 Similarly it also refers to the films of Sultan Rahi and his blooms
 

 lagbhag do dashakon ve is avadhi ke dauraan sabase vyast abhinayta bane, unki filmon ne itane saare record kiye, jisamen vishwa record bhi shaamil he
 

 which means that most of the cinema audiences liked their films, which is why filmmakers produced such films
 kyon? 


 jaahir taur par laabh ke liye
 

 and if it was a profitable venture
 

 jiskaa matlab he ki unki bahumukhi pratibha or gatisheel abhinay 


 bahes ke liye swasth sanket he isliye yadi aisa bura prabhaavshaalee saamaan tha, to raahi ke jivan main ise ujagar karnaa chahie tha
 


 isliye sabhi bhure rang kii chizon ko chhodkar ham maanate hai ki ham un darshakon or sabhi sultan raahi se upar ke chunaavon kaa sammaan karnaa chahie, keval un sabhi ke liye jimmedaar nahin tha
 


 sound plot film ke saath urdu naatak hameshaa apni chhipi hui ichha bani rahi thi, lekin vah ek abhinayta the, isliye unhone abhinay kiya or jo kuch bhi poocha gaya tha vah sarvshereshth pradaan karata he Finally Sultan Khan was surrounded by his hidden desire and moved to Lahore for his passion and he was acting
 ve lahore main ek kapadon or bade sena kii bahut sari mahatvakankshaon or sapanom ke saath aae
 After landing at Lahore railway station, he rented a room in Kachi Abadi behind Malik Studios to become Pakistan's top actor
 purv abhinayta badalaji jo bhi lalpurpur se aae the, vah abhinay ke liye bahut utsuk the or ek atirikt / senaanee ke rup main filmon main pravesh karne main sakasham the
 Sultan and Changeji became friends and remained very good friends throughout their lives
 donon ke paas cycle thi or is chakra par studio main aane ke liye istemaal hota tha
 Finally, through Changeji, in Ashfaq Malik's film Baaghi, which was released on 14 September 1956, Sultan Khan also got into films as an extra
 bhagahi main unka pehla abhinay karier film kii sthiti ke anusaar ek sthitik or chup bhoomika thi, jab olodin ne yasmine ko graminon ke saamne "maut ko dil de do sadaa e dil" ke liye nrity karne ko majaboor kiya, sultan khan un nrity darshakon ke graminon ke bich khadaa tha
 This was the beginning and an actor was born, who played the same silent and steady role in many films like Hatim, Watan, Daku Ki Larki etc
 ant main yah 1960 tha, pehali baar jab unhone es ke liye kuch film samvaad die
 M

 daara ne acha pradarshan kiya or kuch anya film nirdeshkon ne sultan raahi ko bhi chunaa
 On the other hand Aslam Dar started his new project Dil Lagi, which was purely a social romantic film, he then gave a character role to Sultan Rahi but as it was a period of action films, the film distributors suggested and demanded a For the action film Aslam Darato Aslam Dar pends the project of Dil Ki Laji and starts the action film Akhri Chitan, which was the story of two brothers who split Are feeling, had come to Pakistan with them and other Hindus are like he played as Muslim and Hindu characters in a Hindu family Nasrulla Butt and Sultan Rahi respectively grown

 In the end Aslam Parvez decided to make an action Punjabi film so that he formulated the idea of basheera and attempted to include Sawan as Basheera, which was successfully achieved after Khan Chacha, but after his denial, Aslam Dar was finalized to take Sultan Rahi as the protagonist of the film, but after hearing this idea they all became the heroes of Sultan Rahi Were not in favor of lekin asalam daar khud samanabad gaye jahaan un dinon sultan raahi un dinon main rahete the ki unhen yah suchit karne ke liye ki unhone unhen apane vaada ke anusaar film ke nayak ke rup main le liya tha

 antat asalam daar ne khud ko film relies karne kaa faisla kiya, unhone sanbok cinema ko kaam par rakhaa or film jari kii
 Six other films were also released at the same time, but after the first show of the film everyone was talking about Basheera

 The real story of Sultan Rahi began after the success of Iqbal Billi Babal and Aslam Dar's Basheera when an extra / fighter became the lead actor of an emotionally angry man
 Sultan Rahi's inner actors were visible during his struggle days but his dedication And his dedication to acting was not fully revealed
