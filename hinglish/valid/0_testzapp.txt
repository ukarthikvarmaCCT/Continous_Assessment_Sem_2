 In many languages it is also known as Röntgen radiation, which is based on the name of its investigator Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen
 rontjan equalent maanav isaki shastreey maapak ikai he
 In 1895 X-ray was invented by Wilhelm Konrad Runtzen, a professor of physics at the University of Wurtzburg in Germany
 yadi kaanch kii nalika main se vaayu ko pump se kramash: nikaala jaae or usamen ucch vibhav kaa vidyudvisarjan kiya jaae, to daab ke paryaapt alp hone par vaayu swayan prakashit hone lagati he
 While conducting an experimental study of this phenomenon, Rantzen observed that when the air pressure was very low, the rays coming out of the sluice tube gave light to barium platinocyanide and, when the tube was completely covered with black paper Also, the manibh kept nearby keeps on shouting
 at: yah spasht tha ki visarjananalika ke baahar jo kirane aati hai ve kaale kaagaj main se sugamawa se paar ho sakati hai or barium platinosynide ke parade ko dhyutimaan karne kaa vishesh gun in kirnon main he
 Such rays were not yet known in science
 at: in nai avishkrut kirnon kaa naam 'eksrez' rakhaa gaya, kintu rantjan ke sammaan main, visheshat : germany main, in kirnon ko 'rantjan kirane' hi kaha jaataa he
 As soon as Rantzen's invention was published, the attention of the entire scientific world was attracted to X-ray
 apaardarshee thos padaartho main se paar hone kaa eksre kaa gundharm atyant mahatvapurn tha or is gundharm kaa upyog vigyaan ke anek vibhaagon main ho saktaa tha
 Therefore, efforts were made to produce X-rays and study their properties in many physics laboratories
 alp daab par vaayu main jo vidyut visarjan hota he, uske adhyayan kaa aadhunik bhautikee ke vikaas main ek vishesh sthaan he
 If by connecting a long glass tube with a vacuum pump, the inner air flows through a high voltage current, initially, when the pressure is high, no action is seen, but when the air pressure is reduced first Both are electronegative
 daab ko or kam karne par sampurna nalika dhyutimaan ho jaati he
 According to the interpretation of modern physics, the reason is that when electrons get energy and they move with the remaining air molecules while moving at high velocity towards the positive
 sanghaton ke kaaran anuon ke aayan banate hai or jab ye aayan purv avasthaa ko praapt hote hai tab prakaash kaa utsarjan hota he
 Due to the existence of ions, electrophoresis continues in the air
 daab ke atyant alp ho jane par electranon se sanghaat hone ke liye paryaapt anu nahin rahete; at: electron runagra se nikalakar apni sampurna urja se dhanagar se sidhe takaraate hai
 Due to these effects, the intense energy of electrons gets to the atoms of the cation and one result is the production of X-rays
 is paddati se eksre kaa utpaadan karne ke liye nalika main ek kranthik daab kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 If the air pressure is higher than this critical pressure, then there is not enough energy in the electrons to produce the x-ray
 duusari ore, yadi daab is kranthik daab se kam ho to electron utpann hi nahin hote, at: vidyudvisarjan hi band ho jaataa he
 Initially the X-ray was produced using a similar type of aerial and the air pressure was kept at a critical value of this critical pressure
 eksre ke do vishesh gundharm adhik mahatvapurn hai : There are three main methods of intensity measurement
 pratideept parade par eksre se jo dipti aati he uski tivrata-maryaadit dipti tak-eksre kii tivrata kii samaanupati hoti he
 The intensity of the x-ray can be broadly compared by estimating the intensity of fluorescence
 duusari vidhi main photo pattica ke upar eksre kii jo kriya hoti he, uskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The blackness that comes from the X-ray incident on the photo plate depends on the intensity of the X-ray and the time of incidence
 is paddati se do eksre punjon kii tivrataon kii tulana karne ke liye adhik tivrata ke eksre punj se photo pattica par maryaadit sthaan par kisi upyukt kaal tak kriya hone di jaati he or tatpashchaat usee pattica par kuch neeche duusare eksre punj kii kriya kaal t, 2t, 3t aadi tak hone di jaati he
 After developing the plaque, comparing the blackness of the two pictures gives a sense of the relative intensity of the two arms
 tivrathamapan kii teesri reeti adhik prachlit he, kyonki is reeti se tivrata thik thik maapi ja sakati he
 When the x-ray passes through the air, the air becomes electronegative and its conductivity depends on the intensity of the x-ray
 eksre kii kriya se vaayu ke anuon ke electron visthapit hote hai or aayan utpann hote hai
 In the presence of proper electrodepolarization, the electrons that can be obtained from ions can be measured with a sensory electronometer, or with other appropriate sensory devices
 eksre kii tivrata vidyuddhara kii samaanupati hoti he
 More recently, the use of multiplier-illuminant and x-ray sensing spurs has made intensity measurements extremely accessible
 usee prakaar, gaigagunak kii sahaayta se ynikaran kii dhara kaa maapan bhi sugamawa se ho saktaa he
 Therefore, measurement of intensity of X-rays by both these types of devices is more prevalent in present day
 tivrathamapan kii in teenon prachlit ritiyon se do eksre punjon kii tivrataon kii keval tulana hi ho sakati he, nirpeksh tivrata praapt nahin ho sakati
 In fact, we can call the intensity of the X-ray as the energy exerted per second on an area of one square centimeter perpendicular to the x-ray
 is tivrata ko arg prati varg centimetre prati senkad main vyakt karte hai
 In order to measure intensity as energy, the energy of the X-ray is very low because in this way intensely specific instruments are required for intensification
 is reeti se tivrathamapan kaa pratham prayaas terril ne kiya tha
 Subsequently, in 1953, Henderson, BT and Laffan of the University of Illinois in the United States also tried
 ati prachand vidyudvibhav se utpann eksre kii tivrata keval isi reeti se naapi ja sakati he
 Experimental work of physics always requires units and has its shape according to the measured amount
 eksre kii maatra ke ekak ko 'rantjan' kehete hai or vartmaan kaal main ek rantjan kii paribhaasha nimnlikhit prakaar se kii jaati he- Another special feature of X-rays is their solubility
 bhinn bhinn thos pindon kii samaan motaayiyon main se paar hone par eksre kii tivrata main jo kami hoti he vah samaan nahin hoti
 The absorption of X-rays is higher in some solids and less in some substances
 prayog dwaara yah fal praapt hua ki kisi thos vishesh kii bhinn bhinn motaayiyon main se yadi eksre paar jaae, to nirgat eksre ko tivrata, praarambhik tivrata or thos padaarth kii motaai, in teenon main nimnlikhit sameekaran ke anusaar sambandh rahata he : log = - m × thickness --- yahan = eksre kii praarambhik tivrata; i = intensity of x-ray after crossing through solid material; m = ek sthiraank, jisko 'avasorana gunak' kehete hai
 This constant is called that solid's special x-ray-absorption-multiplier
 vastut: yah rekhiy gunak he
 To express it broadly, it is divided into the density of that solid substance and thus the absorption coefficient obtained is called 'code-absorption-factor'
 at: mmass = m / density sanhati-avasorana-gunak kaa vishesh mahatv yah he ki vah avasorak padaarth kaa lakshanik gundharm he
 For example, the linear absorption-multiplier of water and steam is different, because water is liquid and steam is gas
 parantu jal tathaa bhaap kaa eksre sanhati-avasorana-gunank samaan hi hota he, kyonki jal tathaa bhaap ke rasinic sanrachak abhinn hai arthath hydrogen tathaa oxijan
 The variation of the properties of light and x-rays is very clear from the code-absorption-multiplier
 saadhaarant: drav or thos padaarth prakaash ke liye swayan apaardarshee athwa parbhasak hote hai
 Diamond is transparent and graphite opaque to light, but the codon-absorption-coefficient of X-ray remains the same for diamond and graphite, as these two materials are essentially different forms of carbon
 eksre nalika se jo sampurna eksre praapt hote hai, un sabakaa avasorana-gunak mukhyat: vidyudvibhav or avasorak parade kii dhaatu kaa parmaanu-kramank, in donon par nirbhar rahata he
 As the voltage increases, the penetration or hardness of the x-ray produced increases
 sameekaran se yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki kisi ek thos padaarth ke liye avasorana gunak sab motaayiyon ke liye sthir rahegaa
 But in direct use, the low passable portion of radiation received from the x-ray tube is completely absorbed in the first levels of the absorber screen
 keval adhik praveshkshmata ke eksre avasorana parade ke antim staron tak pahunch pate hai
 It is clear that the absorption factor of the x-ray entering the absorption screen is higher than the absorption factor of the x-ray crossing the absorption screen
 jab samast eksre kaa avasorana gunak samaan hota he tab unako samang eksre kehete hai
 Thus the amount of X-rays is measured by their intensity and their characteristic by their absorption-multiplier
 jis padaarth se prakaash aata he us padaarth ko ham dekh sakate hai, kyonki prakaash kirnon kii ek kriya hamaari aankh ke roopaadhar par hoti he
 This type of action is not by X-ray, so X-rays are not visible
 itnaa hi nahin, aankhon par tathaa sharir ke anya angon par eksre kii kriya atyant hanikaarak hoti he
 Due to the action of X-rays on living cells for a sufficient period of time, they are reduced
 eksre sharir ke charm main se saralata se paar ho jate hai or bheetar ke jivit koshaaon par inaki paryaapt kaal tak kriya hone se unke mrit ho jane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Again, X-ray effects are durable; Therefore, X-ray activity continues at different places at the same place of the body, and in some periods, cancer-like refractory diseases occur
 at: eksre kaa upyog karte samay atyant saavdhaanee se kaary karne kii aavashyaktaa rahati he
 Special tools are used to protect the body
 iske atirikt eksre kaa nity upyog karanevaale vartmaan kaal main ek eksre-maatra-maapi apni jeb main rakhte hai, jisase pataa chalata he ki vikiran kii kitni maatra karmchaaree ke upar kaary kar chuki he
 This lethal property of X-rays is also used in other diseases; For example, if harmful pathogens grow in any part of the body, they can be destroyed by using X-rays on them
 eksre kaa ayurvigyaan main, visheshat: shalyakarm main, adhik upyog hota he
 The possibility of this type of use was evident from the time of X-ray's invention
 sharir ke bhinn-bhinn avyavon ke avasorana-gunak vibhinn hote hai; at: sharir ke kisi bhi bhaag main se eksre paar karke photo lene se asthiyaan tathaa anya ghatak pruthak pruthak dikhaai dete hai 
 Therefore, X-ray photographs are very useful before surgery, or to find out what condition the disease is in
 eksre ke utpaadan main pragati hone par unka upyog udyogon main bhi hone laga or vartmaan kaal main dhaatuvigyaan main eksre kaa upyog aavashyak ho gaya he
 Energy is either combined with particles or combined with waves
 kisi udgam se urja kaa visarjan hota ho to is urja kaa astitv saadhaarant: vidyucchambukiy tarangon kii tivrata main, athwa electron, proton, neutron, aayan ityadi kanon kii gatij urja ke rup main, vyakt hota he
 The patterns of wave and particle are different; Therefore, they are usually kept in different categories
 kintu anek prayogon ke falon se yah spasht ho gaya he ki in virgon kaa bandhan tarangon main kanon ke gun hai or, vilomat: kanon main bhi tarangon ke gun hai
 This duality form began with the principle of the heat of the Planck
 eksre ke gun bhi is dwait rup ke apwaad nahin hai
 X-rays have certain properties of waves and certain properties are also of particles
 pehle ham tarangeey gunon par vichaar karenge
 From the fruits of early experiments, it was clear that X-rays and light have properties comparable
 eksre tathaa prakaash kii kirnon kaa dik main saral rekhaon main prachaaran hota he
 Like light, the intensity of an x-ray is also inversely proportional to the square of the distance
 photo pattica par honevaali kriya tathaa gas main kiye gaye ynikaran ke gunon main bhi donon main samya he
 In 1905 AD, by experiment, Marx proved that the velocity of the x-ray is the same as the velocity of light — that is, 3 × 10 ° cm per second
 vaidyut tathaa chumbakeey kshetron main eksre aprabhavit rahete hai
 It was clear from all these properties that X-rays are electromagnetic in nature, not light charged particles
 bhed keval tarangadairghyo main ho saktaa he
 From the experiments of scientists such as Haga, Windt, Walters, Pol, Sommerfeld, etc
, it could be inferred that the wavelength of the x-ray was 1 × 10–8 cm
 Is near kintu pratham nirnayaatmak fal lave, freederish tathaa kniping ke prayogon se praapt hua or eksre kii tarangadairghy pramanit hui
 After this experiment, several attempts were made to clarify the wavelength of the X-ray and to obtain experimental results of other results in relation to it and to obtain experimental results of other dimensions with respect to it
 eksre kaa tarangadairghy prakaash ke tarangadairghy se bahut kam hone ke kaaran jin prayogon dwaara prakaash kaa tarangadairghy saralata se mapa ja saktaa he, vaise prayog eksre ke liye karne main anek kathinaaiyaan upasthit hoti hai
 However, in the present times, experiments like X-ray interference, diffraction, polarization, etc
 have been successful, and the wavelengths of the X-rays have been known to be as high as the optical waves
 jin prayogon se eksre kii tarangaprakruti pramanit hoti he unamem se kuch neeche die ja rahe hai- X-rays are particularly helpful in finding the crystalline structure
 chikitsiya upyogon ke alaava bhi eksre kaa anekon prakaar se upyog kiya jaataa he
 Due to the unique properties of X-rays, they are widely used in many branches of science and in various industries
 udyogon main, visheshat: nirmaan tathaa nirmit padaartho ke gunon ke niyantran main, eksre kaa bahut upyog hota he
 Intrinsic errors of manufactured materials can be easily detected by X-ray photographs

 Each such component is tested with an X-ray and the defective components are discarded
 dhaatu eksre kaa avasorana karte hai, at: dhaatuon ke antarbhaagon kii pariksha ke liye mridu eksre anupyukt hote hai
 Extremely high-voltage X-rays are required for large-sized metallic materials
 dhaatu vigyaan tathaa dhatugaveshna main eksre atyant upyogi hai
 Metals are also crystalline, but their crystals are fine and they are set up in the desired way, so the lave-statue of metals usually has a concentric circle
 prayek vartual ek samaan tivrata kaa hota he, kintu kisi bhautik kriya se kanon ke aakaaron main vruddhi ho jane par in vartualon main bindu bhi aate hai
 Therefore, by X-ray interference, it is known exactly what the particles of metallic particles are and how their shape is like
 is gyaan kaa dhaatuvigyaan main atyant mahatv he
 At the time of making metal materials, heat causes them to become insoluble
 dhaatu ko modane se bhi usamen antarvikruti ho jaati he
 Such distortions can be analyzed by X-ray
 is prakaar vishisht gunon se yukt nirdosh dhaatu praapt karne main eksre kaa vishesh upyog hota he
 Among other uses of X-rays, the X-ray microscope is notable
 eksre ke tarangadairghy prakaash ke tarangadairghyo se sookshm hote hai, at: eksre sookshmdarshi ko prakaash sookshmdarshi se adhik prabhaavshaalee hona chahie
 In 1948, Kirkpatrick's efforts to focus X-rays were partially successful
 is reeti se tathaa anya ritiyon se pratibimb kaa aavardhan karne ke praytn ab praayogic avasthaa paar kar chuke hai or anek nirmaataaon dwaara nirmit kai prakaar ke eksre sookshmdarshi sulabh hai
 Things that cannot be detected with light microscope are easily understood by X-ray microscope

 a social network is a social framework in which nodes are individuals or organizations
 ye node aapas main ek yaa adhik prakaar ke sambandhon se jude hote hai
 Making friends, withdrawing friendships, liking, disliking, following, following off, group or financial transactions and shopping are some of the tasks that are mostly done on social networks
 anekon kshetron main anusandhan se yah baat siddh hui he ki saamaajik network, parivaar se lekar raashtra tak ke anek staron par kaam karata he
 How problems are solved; How institutions are run; Social networks play a very important role in determining the extent to which individuals are successful in achieving their goals

 Kadambari is a great novel of Sanskrit literature
 iske rachanaakaar vanbhatta hai
 It is entitled to be called the world's first novel
 isaki katha sambhavtah gunanty dwaara rachit baddkaha ke raja sumanas kii katha se lee gayi he
 This book could not be completed in the lifetime of Banabhatta
 unki mrityu ke baad unke putr bhushanbhatta ne ise puraa kiya or pita dwaara likhit bhaag kaa naam 'purvabhag' evam swayan dwaara likhit bhaag kaa naam 'uttarbhag' rakhaa
 Where Harshacharitam is ideal for a narrative, there is prose poetry in the form of Kadambari Katha
 baan ke hi shabdon main is katha ne purvavarti do kathaon kaa atikaraman kiya he
 Unavailable Vaidagdhyavilasamuddhaya Dhia nibhitaye-matidvayi katha-kadambari
 sambhavtah ye kathaayen gunanty kii brihatkatha evam subandhu kii vaasavadatta thim
 It seems that Baan died without completing this work, as his son has said: pulind athwa bhushanbhatta ne is katha ko sampoorn kiya
 The story of Kadambari is summarized as follows: isamen ek kaalpanik katha he jisamen chandrapid tathaa pundaree ke teen janmon kaa ullekh he
 According to the narration, Atisha Sundari Chandal brings a parrot named Kanya Vaishampayan to the court of Naresh Shudraka
 yah tota manushya kii boli bolta he
 In the King's q & A, the parrot tells that his mother is dead and that his father was captured by the hunter and took him to the ashram after capturing the disciple of Zabali Muni
 isi ke bich rishi jabali dwaara raja chandrapid tathaa uske mitra vaishampayan kii katha he
 In Ujjayini there was a king named Tarapid who had a wise minister named Shuknas
 raja ko chandrapid naam ke ek putr kii prapti hui or mantri ke putr kaa naam vaishampayan tha
 In the context of Digvijay, Chandraped arrived at a beautiful Achhodasarovar where a beautiful girl named Kumari Mahasweta, waiting for the late lover Pundarik in the untimely, found her
 mahasweta ne apni sakhi kadambari ke vishay main chandrapid ko bataaya or uske kadambari ke paas le gayi
 Kadambari and Chandrapid fell in love with the first darshan
 tabhi chandrapid ke pita ne use vaapis bulaayaa or apni patralekha naam kii paricharika ko kadambari ke paas chhodkar chandrapid waapas aa gaya
 Patralekhaa also pleased Chandrapid by sending Kadambari-related information
 baan kii kriti yahan samaapt ho jaati he
 As far as the plot is concerned, Banabhatta is indebted to Brihatkatha
 somdev dwaara rachit brihatkatha ke sanskrit sanskaran main uplabdh somdev evam kamarandrika kii katha chandrapid evam kadambari kii katha se samya rakhti hai
 But the characterization of Shuknas is the imagination of Vaishampayan and the love story of Mahashweta etc

 Baan is a monarch of Sanskrit-prose
 baan kii kadambari apni adbhut kathavstu, rasaatmakataa tathaa ascharyajanak style ke kaaran sadaa kautuhal kii vastu rahi he
 The extreme splendor of ornate prose, with its entire grandiose possibilities, has appeared in his Kadambari with full vigor

 To make this interesting but annoying prose poem a tradition, its simple and concise adaptations started
 ab tak kadambari ke gadhy or padya main nibaddh 12 saar prakaash main aa chuke hai
 Atul Aishwarya of Sanskrit prose, his subtle influences, the hearty softness and the euphoric consternation with which the skill could be exploited is radiant in Kadambari
 baan kii kala kaa sparsh paakar kadambari chhando-viheen kavita ban gayi he
 The classical pattern of prose that Subandhu had enforced, Baan accepted it, but by incorporating 'poetic beauty' into it, it has given him incomplete balsam
 kala-shilp tathaa bhavasbalata ke manjul mishran ke kaaran hi sanskrit gadhyakaron main baan kaa sthaan sarvopari he
 Rasa-gradation, art-aesthetics, curvilinear expression system, condescending phonology, lamp, metaphor and rhetorical scheme of hypocrisy, intertwined with intertwined syllogism, contradiction and parody, are personal features of the prose of the arrow
 baan ke haath main aakar sanskrit gadhy kavita kii udaatt bhavbhumi ko pahunch gaya he
 But weighed by the mixed rage in Baan's Rasavanti 'kadambari', Weber has compared his prose to Indian Kantar, in which the wanderer has to make his own path by cutting through the axes of grit and grit with the ax of his patience and labor
 
 us par bhi use aprachlit shabdon ke rup main upasthit vanyajeevon kii dahaad kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 This attack by Weber is not entirely unfounded

 In fact, there is no such subject, emotion and expression-type, which the arrow has not invented continuously
 sahruday aalochak ne 'banochishtan jagatsarvam' kah baan kii is uplabdhi kaa abhinandan kiya he
 The complexity and greatness of Kadambari led to the tradition of its simple and concise variations, so that even the common people can appreciate it
 gadhy-padya main nibaddh iske lagbhag 12 saar gyaat athwa uplabdh he
 The available abstracts of Kadambari can be divided into two main classes

 taaja pattey bahut mand hote hai or tode jane or kai hafton tak sukhaye jane tak ve apana puraa swaad viksit nahin kar pate hai
 Many other plants use the term "bay leaf", but not in the context of bay laurel leaves
 These include: be laurel vriksh ko likhit itihaas kii shuruyaat se ugaaya jaataa rahaa he
 Cassia originated in Asia Minor and spread to the Mediterranean and other countries with suitable climates
 tej patta uttari kshetron main nahin ugaaya jaataa he, kyonki ye paudhe thandi jalwaayu main nahin panpate hai
 Turkey is one of the major exporters of bay leaves, although they are also found in areas of France, Belgium, Italy, Russia, Central America, North America and India
 laurel vriksh jisase tej patta praapt kiya jaataa he yunaan or rome main pratikatmak or vastutah donon hi rup se bahut mahatvapurn tha

 tej patta europe or uttari america main paak kriya main sabase vyapak rup se prayog kiye jane vaali jadi bootiyon main se ek he
 If eaten whole, bay leaves are hard and have a strong, bitter taste
 jaisaa kii kai masaalon or swaad main vruddhi karne vaale samagriyon ke saath hota he, tej pattey kii sugandh uske swaad se adhik ullekhneey he
 When dried, its fragrance is herb-like, slightly floral and somewhat like oregano and Jalanim
 micreen, jo kai sugandhit telon kaa ghatak he jinka istemaal parafum banane main kiya jaataa he, use tej pattey se nikaala ja saktaa he
 The bay leaf also contains the aromatic oil eugenol
 tej patta kai europea vyanjanon ko pakaane kii ek visheshta he or saath hi uttari america main bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 They are used in soups, stews, meat, seafood and vegetable dishes
 ye pattiyaan kai shastreey francisi vyanjanon main bhi apana swaad bikherti hai
 These leaves are often used in their full size and removed before serving
 bhartiya or pakistani paakshaalaon main tej pattey kaa upyog aksar biryani or anya masaaledaar vyanjanon main tathaa garam masaale main ek ghatak ke rup main kiya jaataa he - haalanki har roj gharelu rasoi main iskaa istemaal nahin hota
 Bay leaves can be crushed or ground before cooking
 kuchle hue pattey khadey pattey kii tulana main apni vaanchit khushboo ko adhik pradaan karte hai, lekin inhen hataanaa adhik mushkil hota he or isliye inhen aksar ek malamal bag yaa chaay kii thili ke andar istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Grounded leaves can be used in place of standing leaves and do not need to be removed, but are relatively strong due to the increased surface area and the texture may not be desirable in some dishes
 tej patton ko pentry main khaadya keet, mackhiyon or tilchatton ko dur bhagane ke liye bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 It is also true that Romanians keep a dry bay leaf under their pillow on St
 Valentine's Day
 yah mana jaataa tha ki is pattey ke kaaran swapn main upyogkarta kii mulaaqaat apane bhavi pati / patni se hoti he
 In the Middle Ages, bay leaves were thought to be abortifacient and possessed many magical properties

 Bay leaves have many properties that make them useful in treating high blood sugar, migraine headaches, bacterial and fungal infections, and gastric ulcers
 tej pattiyon or jamun ko unke kastyle, vatahar, swedajanak, pachan, mutrvardhak, ubakaai or bhukh badhaanevaale gunon ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Bay leaf oil is used for peeling and spraining

 laurel parivaar ke kuch sadasyon, saath hi asambandhit lekin dekhne main samaan parvatiy laurel or cheri laurel main aise pattey hote hai jo manushyon or pashuon ke liye jahrile hote hai
 While these plants are not sold anywhere for culinary use, their similarity with bay leaves has reinforced the notion that bay leaves should be removed from food after cooking because they are poisonous
 yah sach nahin he - tej pattiyon ko vishakt prabhaav ke bina khaaya ja saktaa he
 However, they remain very stiff even after complete cooking and if swallowed whole or in large pieces can pose a risk of scratching or suffocation in the digestive system
 is prakaar tej pattey ke istemaal vaale adhikansh vyanjanon main khaanaa pakaane kii prakriya ke baad unhen hataa dene kii salaah di jaati he
 In frost-free or mild frost areas, gardeners find that bay laurel plants planted in the ground voluntarily grow giant trees, 38 feet and even taller; But while pruning, the bay laurel tree grows like a small shrub
 be laurel ko contenron main bhi viksit kiya ja saktaa he, jiskaa aakaar ped ke antim aakaar ke rup main uske vikaas ko roktaa he
 New plants are grown by layering, or pen, as it can be difficult to grow from seed
 be ped ko beej se ugaana mushkil hota he, jiskaa aanshik kaaran he beej kaa kam ankuran dar or lambi ankuran avadhi
