 Wallerstein also believes that these three categories of nations are linked with exploitative modes of production through which the transfer of wealth is taking place towards the center states of the periphery

 Some authors, such as Chase and Poon, believe that Wallerstein limited it to only economic factors, while other factors also play an important role

 But if a deep study is made, the roots of the present world system are stronger than in medieval Europe
 uparokt donon hi avasthaaon main adhyayan ke pashchaat ham kah sakate hai ki nirbharta ke siddhanth kii pramukh visheshtaayen nimnlikhit hai - The principle of dependence has been criticized on the following major grounds: uparokt aalochanaon ke baavjood is siddhanth kii upyogita ko bhi nakaara nahin ja saktaa jo nimnlikhit hai- Therefore, it can be concluded that through the principle of dependence, an attempt has been made to study the changed nature of the world system through the relations between the center and the periphery nations

 Although the views of different scholars differ, there seems to be a general consensus on economic factors or capitalism's importance in understanding the international politics

 He died on 8 February 2016 in Mumbai
 dilli main pita murtuza hasan or maan jameel fatima ke ghar teesri santan nen janm liya jiskaa naam bade bhai ke naam ke kaafiye se mila kar muktada hasan rakhaa gaya
 The date of his birth was written on 12 October 1938 in the records of Delhi Corporation
 pita swayan bhi shaayar the
 He spent his childhood in Gwalior where he was educated
 unhone 1958 main gwalior college se snatakottar padhai puri kari
 He started writing from a young age
 nida fazli inkaa lekhan kaa naam he
 Nida means Voice / Voice / Voice
 faazila qashmir ke ek ilaake kaa naam he jahaan se nida ke purakhe aakar dilli main bas gaye the, isliye unhone apane upnaam main fazli joda
 When he was studying, a girl used to sit in front of him, so that he started experiencing an unknown, unabashed relationship
 lekin ek din college ke board par ek notice dikhaa "miss Tondon met with an accident and has expired" 
 Nida was very sad and found that nothing written by him was able to express his grief, nor was he able to write something in the way that he felt that he was hurt
 Let's open the knobs
 ek din subah vah ek mandir ke paas se gujarey jahaan par unhone kisi ko surdaas kaa bhajan madhuban tum kyon rahat hare? birh biyog syam sundar ke thaadhe kyon na jare? gaate suna, jisamen krishna ke mathura se dwarka chale jane par unke viyog main dubi radha or gopiyaan phulwari se puch rahi hoti hai i phulwari, tum hari kyon bani hui ho? krishna ke viyog main tum khadey-khadey kyon nahin jal gayi? vah sun kar nida ko laga ki unke andar dabe hue dukh kii girahen khul rahi he
 Then he also read many other poets like Kabirdas, Tulsidas, Baba Farid etc
 and he found that the simple, unadulterated, two-piece language works of these poets are more effective like Udhur of the Surdas, not mind ten twenty
 ek huto so gayu syam sang, ko aradhai te is
, na ki mirza gaalib kii ebstract bhashaa main "dil-e-nadaan tuje hua kya he?"
 Since then, such simple language has always become his own style

 Wandered in many cities in search of income
 us samay bombay hindi / urdu sahitya kaa kendra tha or vahaan se dharmayug / sarika jaisi lokapriy or sammanit patrikas chhapati thim to 1964 main nida kaam kii talash main vahaan chale gaye or dharmayug, blitz jaisi patrikaon, samachar patron ke liye likhane lage
 His simple and effective writing style soon earned him respect and popularity

 Film producer-director-writer Kamal Amrohi was making the film Razia Sultana, whose songs Jannisar Akhtar was writing, which died suddenly
 jannisar akhtar gwalior se hi the or nida ke lekhan ke bare main jaankaree rakhte the jo unhone shat-pratishat shuddh urdu bolne vaale kamaal amrohi ko bataaya hua tha
 Then Kamal Amrohi approached him and asked him to write the remaining two songs of the film which he wrote
 is prakaar unhone filmi geet lekhan prarambh kiya or uske baad inhone kai hindi filmon ke liye gane likhe
 In his book Mulaqaten, he wrote about many established writers of the time and highlighted the courtesy of Indian writing in which people receive awards and honors based on their contacts with rich and politically empowered people
 iskaa bahut virodh hua or aise kai sthapit lekhakon ne nida kaa bahishkaar kar diya or aise sammelnon main sammilit hone se manaa kar diya jisamen nida ko bulaayaa ja rahaa ho
 When he went to Pakistan, after a mushaira, radical mullahs surrounded him and wrote lions - par apana virodh prakat karte hue unase poocha ki kya nida kisi bachche ko allaah se bada samajhate hai? nida ne uttar diya ki main keval itnaa jaanata hoon ki masjid insaan ke haath banaate hai jabaki bachche ko allaah apane haathon se banaata he

 Psychoanalysis is mainly concerned with the study of human mental actions and behaviors, but it can also be applied to societies

 After Fried, the credit for further development of the theory of psychoanalysis goes to Zac Lanka
 froid ko vishwaas tha ki manushya apni ichchhaaon, yon-kaamanaayon or aavashyaktaaon kii purti main naakaam rahane par hone vaali takaleef ke ehsaas ko dabaata he
 In the process, there is a feeling of guilt towards incomplete desires within him, leading to feelings of frustration, introspection and, after a period, self-inferiority and self-loathing

 This subconscious is not always suppressed and comes across as dreams or spontaneous or rational responses to events

 froid kii vyakhya ke mutabik jivan or jagat ke saath vividh sambandhon main judane ke liye putr or maan ke bich kaa kaalpanik sutara bhang karnaa zaruri he or yah bhoomika pita ke hisse main aati he
 Under the father's intervention, the son has to give up his sexual desire to the mother
 vah dekhtaa he ki pita ke paas shishn he jo maan ke paas nahin he
 He is afraid that if he violates the authority of the father, then he may have to be castrated like the mother

 Maternal menstrual crisis leads the son to abandon the mother

 At the same time, he gave a better explanation of the ego that gave rise to narcissism, while Froyd did not pay much attention to this aspect
 lakaan ne dekha ki froid ke mutabik maatrumanogranthi kaa shikaar hote samay balak bolne kii umr main aa jaataa he
 That is, when the foundation of his subconscious is laying on the basis of primitive self-repression, at that time his steps as a doer fall in the language region
 yahi vah kshan he jab baccha bhashaa ke zariye kaamana ke janm or daman se vaakif hota he

 Seeing himself in the mirror, that is, while interviewing his own image, he realizes his difference with his mother

 This process of moving from fimbralism to symbolism takes place in the order of three decisive moments according to Lankan chah maheene se dedh saal kii aayu ke bich maan bachche ko jab sheesha dikhaati he to vah khud ko alag se pahchaan kar apane ekikrut or pruthak astitv se parichit hota he
 Lankan considers it to be the beginning of the moment of narcissism, that is, the place of the ego's self-immolation is born and the body becomes the target of love
 lekin isi kshan ek or ghatana hoti he
 Finding himself different from mother, he thinks two things
 pehali, yah main hoon or duusari, main maan ke saath ekmec na ho kar anya hoon
 This is where the feeling of strangeness is born
 baccha darpan main apni jis chhavi ko dekhtaa he, vah uski suchak he
 The first image is not his permission but his replacement image
 lakaan bataate hai ki isiilie mirar-image kaa charan ahan ke vikaas kii shuruyaat to banataa he, par yah buniyaad ek aisi samaj par rakhi jaati he jo yatharthamulak nahin hoti
 In the world of psychoanalysis, there is a lot of debate on whether the psychopath's mind can be reached through dialogue
 Is there no resistance to psychiatric inquiries within the psychiatrist? At the center of differences arising in the process of finding answers to these questions are issues related to maternal haemorrhage and infant-sexuality
 manorog ke rup main unmaad ko mahatva dene vaale manovishleshak maatrumanogranthi kii paidaaish ke kshan ko kuch zyaada hi ahmiyat dete hai, jabaki khandit manskta kaa vishleshan karne waalon kii taraf se ise bahut kam praathamikta milti he

 hindi kshetra main communist party ke sansthaapak satyabhakt ji ne apane ek saakshaatkaar main kaha ki ‘desh kii baat’ param deshbhakt sakhaaraam ganesh deuskar likhit bengali bhashaa ke ‘desher katha’ kaa anuwaad tha
 There is no doubt that this book gave us enough inspiration of patriotism in the beginning

 An excerpt from that poem is quoted by Madhav Prasad Mishra at the beginning of the mouthpiece of 'desh Ki Baat', which is as follows: is kavita kaa shesh ansh shri narayan chaturvedi ne apni pustak ‘aadhunik hindi kaa adikaal’ main apni yaaddaasht se uddhrut kiya he

 In the freedom struggle of India, many people took inspiration from the life of Shivaji and sacrificed their body, mind and money for the independence of India
 aaj unki rajaniti ki tarj par nepal va bharat main shivasena naam kaa rajnatik paksh chalaa aa rahaa he
 Shivaji Maharaj was born on 19 February 1630 in the Shivneri fort

 His father was a great knight and his second wife was Tukabai Mohite
 unki mata ji jijabai jadhav kul main utpann asaadhaaran pratibhashali thi or unke pita ek shaktishaalee samant the
 Parents had a great influence on Shivaji Maharaj's character

 They would fret over the misdeeds of the ruling class and become restless

 He gathered and united some faithful friends
 avasthaa badhane ke saath videshi shashan kii bediyaan tod phenkane kaa unka sankalp prabalatar hota gaya
 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was married to Saibai Nimbalkar on 14 May 1640 in Lal Mahal, Poona
 us samay bijapur kaa rajya aapasi sangharsh tathaa videshi akramanakal ke daur se guzar rahaa tha
 Instead of serving the Sultan of such an empire, he started organizing the Mavalas against Bijapur
 mawal pradesh pashchim ghat se judaa he or koi 150 kilometre lambaa or 30 kilometre chaudaa he
 They are considered to be skilled warriors because of leading a struggling life
 is pradesh main maratha or sabhi jati ke log rahete hai
 Shivaji Maharaj took people from all these castes and named them Mavals and organized everyone and became familiar with their state by contacting them
 mawal yuvakon ko laakar unhone durg nirmaan kaa kaary armbh kar diya tha
 The support of the Mavals proved to be as important for Shivaji Maharaj as the latter with the Afghans for Sher Shah Suri
 us samay bijapur aapasi sangharsh tathaa mughalon ke akraman se pareshaan tha
 Sultan of Bijapur, Adilshah, removed his army from many fortifications and handed them over to the local rulers or feudatories
 jab adilshaah biimaar padaa to bijapur main araajaktaa fail gai or shivaji maharaj ne avasar kaa laabh uthaakar bijapur main pravesh kaa nirnay liya
 Shivaji Maharaj adopted the policy of taking control of the fortifications of Bijapur in its later days
 sabase pehla durg tha torana kaa durg
 The fort of Toran was 30 kilometers southwest of Poona
 shivaji ne sultan adilshaah ke paas apana doot bhejkar khabar bhijwai kii ve pehle kiledaar kii tulana main behatar rakam dene ko taiyaar hai or yah kshetra unhen saunp diya jaye
 He had already bribed the court of Adilshah in his favor and according to the advice of his courtiers, Adilshah made Shivaji Maharaj the suzerain of that fort
 us durg main mili sampatti se shivaji maharaj ne durg kii surakshatmak kamiyon kii marammat kaa kaam karavaaya
 Some 10 kilometers away from this was the fort of Rajgarh and Shivaji Maharaj took control of this fort too
 shivaji maharaj kii is samrajya vistaar kii niti kii bhanak jab adilshaah ko mili to vah kshubdh hua
 He asked Shahji Raje to keep his son under control
 shivaji maharaj ne apane pita kii parvaah kiye bina apane pita ke kshetra kaa prabandh apane haathon main le liya or niyamit lagaan band kar diya
 After Rajgarh, he took the fort of Chakan and then the fort of Kondana
 kondana par adhikaar karte samay unhen ghoose deni padi
 After that, Aurangzeb sent Mirzaraja Jai singh and captured 23 forts
 Later Mavala Tanaji Malusare of Shivaji Maharaj captured the Kondhana fort but in that war he received the Virgati, after remembering the right of Kondana in his memory, he was named Sinhagad
 
 shahji raaje ko puna or soopa kii jagiradaari di gai thi or soopa kaa durg unke sambandhi baaji mohite ke haath main thi
 Shivaji Maharaj invaded the fort of Supa at night and took control of the fort and sent Baji Mohite to Shahaji Raje in Karnataka
 uski sena kaa kuch bhaag bhi shivaji maharaj kii seva main aa gaya
 At the same time, the fortress of Purandar died and a fight broke out between his three sons for the succession of the fort
 do bhaaiyon ke nimantran par shivaji maharaj purandar pahunche or kootneeti kaa sahaara lete hue unhone sabhi bhaaiyon ko bandi bana liya
 In this way, his authority was also established on the fort of Purandar
 ab tak kii ghatana main shivaji maharaj ko koi yuddh yaa khunkhraba nahin karnaa padaa tha
 By 1647 AD, he had also become the ruler of the territory from Chakan to Neera
 apni badi sainik shakti ke saath shivaji maharaj ne maidani ilaakon main pravesh karne kii yojana banaai
 Shivaji Maharaj sent an army against the Konkan under the leadership of Abaji Sonder by forming an cavalry army
 aabaaji ne konkan sahit nau anya durgon par adhikaar kar liya
 Apart from this, the fortifications of Tala, Mosmala and Raiti also came under Shivaji Maharaj
 lut kii sari sampatti raigarh main surakshit rakhi gai
 After liberating the governor of Kalyan, Shivaji Maharaj turned to Colaba and incited the chiefs to wage war against foreigners
 bijapur kaa sultan shivaji maharaj kii harkaton se pehle hi aakrosh main tha
 He ordered Shivaji Maharaj's father to be arrested
 shahji raaje us samay karnataka main the or ek vishwasghaatee sahaayak baaji ghorpade dwaara bandi banaakar bijapur laae gaye
 He was also accused that he tried to obtain the service of Qutb Shah who was the ruler of Golconda and hence the enemy of Adilshah
 bijapur ke do saradaaron kii madhyasthata ke baad shahaji maharaj ko is shart par mukt kiya gaya ki ve shivaji maharaj par lagaam kasenge
 For the next four years, Shivaji Maharaj did not launch an attack against Bijipur
 is dauraan unhone apni sena sangathit kii
 Shivaji Rajane did not invade the areas of Bijapur according to the conditions of Salvation of Shahaji, but he tried to increase his power in the south-west
 par is kram main jaavali kaa rajya baadha kaa kaam kar rahaa tha
 The state was located in the far northwest of Satara, between the river Vama and Krishna
 yahan kaa raja chandrarav more tha jisane ye jaagir shivaji se praapt kii thi
 Shivaji asked the More ruler Chandra Rao to join Swaraj but Chandrarao joined with the Sultan of Bijapur
 san 1656 main shivaji ne apni sena lekar jaavali par akraman kar diya
 Chandrarao More and his two sons fought with Shivaji but in the end they were imprisoned but Chandrarao fled
 sthaneey logon ne shivaji ke is krity kaa virodh kiya par ve vidroh ko kuchalane main safal rahe
 With this, Shivaji got the property of eight dynasties stored in that fort
 iske alaava kai mawal sainik murarabaji deshpandey bhi shivaji kii sena main sammilit ho gaye
 Shivaji had both Bijapur and Mughal enemies
 us samay shahzada aurangzeb dakkan kaa soobedaar tha
 At the same time, Sultan Adilshah of Bijapur died on 1 November 1656, after which an atmosphere of chaos arose in Bijapur
 is sthiti kaa laabh uthaakar aurangzeb ne bijapur par akraman kar diya or shivaji ne aurangzeb kaa saath dene kii bajaay usapar dhaava bol diya
 His army attacked Junnar city and looted 200 horses with a lot of wealth
 ahmednagar se 700 ghode, chaar hathi ke alaava unhone gunda tathaa racin ke durg par bhi lutpaat machaai
 As a result, Aurangzeb was upset with Shivaji and the friendship negotiations ended
 shahjahan ke aadesh par aurangzeb ne bijapur ke saath sandhi kar lee or isi samay shahjahan biimaar pad gaya
 Aurangzeb migrated to North India as soon as he was afflicted and became the Shah of the Mughal Empire after imprisoning Shah Jahan there
 dakshin bharat main aurangzeb kii anupasthiti or bijapur kii dawandol raajnneetik sthit ko jaanakar shivaji ne samarji ko zanjeera par akraman karne ko kaha
 But his battle with the Siddis of Janjira lasted for several days
 iske baad shivaji ne khud zanjeera par akraman kiya or dakshin konkan par adhikaar kar liya or daman ke portugaliyon se vaarshik kar ekatra kiya
 After taking over Kalyan and Bhiwandi, they established a naval base there
 is samay tak shivaji 40 durgon ke maalik ban chuke the
 After Aurangzeb returned to Agra, the Sultan of Bijapur also breathed a sigh of relief
 ab shivaji hi bijapur ke sabase prabal shatru rah gaye the
 Shahaji was already asked to keep his son under control but Shahaji showed his inability to do so
 shivaji se nipatane ke liye bijapur ke sultan ne abdullah bhatari ko shivaji ke viruddh bheja
 Afzal traveled in 1659 with 120,000 soldiers
 tulajapur ke mandiron ko nasht karata hua vah satara ke 30 kilometre uttar vaai, shirval ke najadik tak aa gaya
 But Shivaji stayed on the fort of Pratapgarh
 afjal khan ne apane doot krishnaji bhaskar ko sandhi-vaarta ke liye bheja
 He sent a message through him that if Shivaji accepts the subjugation of Bijapur, the Sultan will give him the right to all the areas which are under Shivaji's control
 saath hi shivaji ko bijapur ke darbar main ek sammanit pad praapt hoga
 Though Shivaji's minister and advisor was in favor of As Sandhi, Shivaji did not like these talks
 unhone krishnaji bhaskar ko uchit sammaan dekar apane darbar main rakh liya or apane doot gopinath ko vastusthiti kaa jayja lene afjal khan ke paas bheja
 From Gopinath and Krishnaji Bhaskar, Shivaji felt that Afzal Khan wanted to imprison Shivaji by plotting a treaty
 atah unhone yuddh ke badale afjal khan ko ek bahumoolya uphaar bheja or is tarah afjal khan ko sandhi vaarta ke liye raji kiya
 Both of them had ambushed their soldiers at the place of peace, when the two met at the place of meeting, Afzal Khan attacked Shivaji with his Katiyar, in defense, Shivaji killed Afzal Khan with his clothes
 afjal khan kii mrityu ke baad shivaji ne panhala ke durg par adhikaar kar liya
 After this, along with taking control of the fortifications of Pawangarh and Vasantgarh, he also failed the attack of Rustom Khan
 isse rajapur tathaa daawul par bhi unka kabja ho gaya
 Now an atmosphere of terror had arisen in Bijapur and the feudals there, forgetting mutual differences, decided to attack Shivaji
 2 oktober 1665 ko bijapuri sena ne panhala durg par adhikaar kar liya
 Shivaji was in trouble, but taking advantage of the darkness of the night, he managed to escape
 bijapur ke sultan ne swayan kaman samhaalkar panhala, pavangadh par apana adhikaar waapas le liya, rajapur ko lut liya or shringargarh ke pradhan ko maar daalaa
 At the same time, due to the revolt of Siddijauhar in Karnataka, the Sultan of Bijapur entered into an agreement with Shivaji
 is sandhi main shivaji ke pita shahji ne madhyasthata kaa kaam kiya
 According to this treaty in 1662, Shivaji was recognized as an independent ruler by the Sultan of Bijapur
 isi sandhi ke anusaar uttar main kalyaan se lekar dakshin main ponda tak kaa or purv main indapur se lekar pashchim main daawul tak kaa bhubhag shivaji ke niyantran main aa gaya
 Shivaji's army had by this time 30,000 infantry and 1000 cavalry
 uttar bharat main badshaah banane kii hode khatm hone ke baad aurangzeb kaa dhyaan dakshin kii taraf gaya
 He was aware of Shivaji's growing sovereignty and appointed his maternal uncle Shaista Khan as the Subedar of the South for the purpose of keeping control over Shivaji
 shyska khan apane 1,50,000 phoj lekar soupan or chaakan ke durg par adhikaar kar puna pahunch gaya
 He looted in Maval for 3 years
 ek raat shivaji ne apane 350 mavalo ke saath unpar hamalaa kar diya
 Shaista managed to escape through the window but had to wash her hands with her four fingers in this sequence
 shysta khan ke putr, tathaa chalis rakshakon or anginat sainikon kaa katl kar diya gaya
 After this incident Aurangzeb made Shaista the Subedar of Bengal instead of Deccan and Shahzada Muazzam was sent to replace Shaista
 is jeet se shivaji kii pratishtha main vruddhi hui
 Six years later, Shaista Khan destroyed King Shivaji's entire Mulukh with his 15 xxrep 4 0 army
 is liye us kaa harjaana vasuul karne ke liye shivaji ne mughal kshetron main lutpaat machaana armbh kiya
 Surat was then a stronghold of Western merchants and a gateway for Hindustani Muslims to perform Haj
 yah ek samrudh nagar tha or iskaa bandargah bahut mahatvapurn tha
 Shivaji looted the wealthy merchants of Surat for six days in 1664 with an army of four thousand
 aam aadmi ko unhonen nahin lutaa or phir laut gaye
 The Dutch and the British have mentioned this incident in their articles
 us samay tak europea vyapaariyon ne bharat tathaa anya asian deshon main bas gayi the
 Until Nadir Shah invaded India, no European power thought of attacking the Indian Mughal Empire
 surat main shivaji kii lut se khinn hokar aurangzeb ne inayat khan ke sthaan par gayasuddin khan ko surat kaa faujadaar niyukt kiya
 And Shahzada Muazzam and Deputy General Raja Jaswant Singh were replaced by Diler Khan and Raja Jaisingh
 raja jaisingh ne bijapur ke sultan, europea shaktiyaan tathaa chote samanton kaa sahyog lekar shivaji par akraman kar diya
 In this war, Shivaji started to suffer loss and seeing the possibility of defeat, Shivaji sent a proposal for a treaty
 june 1665 main hui is sandhi ke mutabik shivaji 23 durg mughalon ko de denge or is tarah unke paas keval 12 durg batch jaayenge
 The income from these 23 fortifications was 4 lakh Huns annually
 balaghat or konkan ke kshetra shivaji ko milenge par unhen iske badale main 13 kishton main 40 lakh hun adaa karne honge
 Apart from this, they will also give revenue of 5 lakh Huns every year
 shivaji swayan aurangzeb ke darbar main hone se mukt rahenge par unke putr shambhaji ko mughal darbar main khidamat kerani hogi
 Shivaji will support the Mughals against Bijapur
 shivaji ko agra bulaayaa gaya jahaan unhen laga ki unhen uchit sammaan nahin mil rahaa he
 Against this, he showed his fury in the court and accused Aurangzeb of betrayal
 aurangzeb isse kshubdh hua or usne shivaji ko nazarkaid kar diya or unpar 5000 sainikon ke pehre laga diye
 Aurangzeb intended to kill King Shivaji a few days later
 lekin apane ajod saahas ore yukti ke saath shivaji or sambhaaji donon isse bhaagane main safal rahe
 Shivaji Maharaj went to Banaras after leaving Sambhaji in Mathura with a believing Brahmin, went to Puri and went safely to Rajgarh
 isse maraathon ko navajivan sa mil gaya
 Aurangzeb suspected Jaisingh and got him murdered by poisoning him
 jaswant singh ke dwaara pahal karne ke baad san 1668 main shivaji ne mughalon ke saath duusari baar sandhi kii
 Aurangzeb recognized Shivaji as the king
 shivaji ke putr shambhaji ko 5000 kii manasabadari mili or shivaji ko puna, chaakan or soopa kaa jila lautaa diya gaya
 However, the Mughal suzerainty over Sinhagad and Purandar remained
 san 1670 main surat nagar ko duusari baar shivaji ne lutaa
 Shivaji got the property worth 132 lakhs from the city and while returning he defeated the Mughal army again near Surat
 san 1674 tak shivaji ne un saare pradeshon par adhikaar kar liya tha jo purandar kii sandhi ke antargat unhen mughalon ko dene pade the
 After the establishment of an independent Hindu nation in western Maharashtra, Shivaji wanted to crown his coronation, but Muslim soldiers threatened the Brahmins that whoever crowned Shivaji would be killed
 When this thing reached Shivaji that the Mughal Sardar is making such threats, then Shivaji took it as a challenge and said that now he will get anointed from the Brahmin of that state who is in the authority of the Mughals
 Shivaji's personal secretary Balaji sent three emissaries to Kashi, because Kashi was under the Mughal Empire
 When the messengers gave the message, the Brahmins of Kashi were quite pleased
 But the Mughal soldiers came to know about this and then caught those Brahmins
 But wisely those Brahmins told those messengers in front of the Mughal sannyko that we do not know who Shivaji is
 What line are they from? The messengers did not know that is why they said we do not know
 Then in front of the Sardar of the Mughal soldiers, those Brahmins said that we have to go somewhere else, from which clan Shivaji you have not told, so how can we crown him
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back
 The Mughal Sardar was happy and left the Brahmins and thought of catching the messengers and sending them to Aurangzeb to Delhi, they too escaped silently
 After returning, he told this thing to Balaji Awa and Shivaji
 But surprisingly after two days the same Brahmin reached Raigad with his disciples and crowned Shivaji
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back
 The Mughal Sardar was happy and left the Brahmins and thought of catching the messengers and sending them to Aurangzeb to Delhi, they too escaped silently
 After returning, he told this thing to Balaji Awa and Shivaji
 But surprisingly after two days the same Brahmin reached Raigad with his disciples and crowned Shivaji
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back
 The Mughal Sardar was happy and left the Brahmins and thought of catching the messengers and sending them to Aurangzeb to Delhi, they too escaped silently
 After returning, he told this thing to Balaji Awa and Shivaji
 But surprisingly after two days the same Brahmin reached Raigad with his disciples and crowned Shivaji
 iske baad mughalo ne foot daalane kii koshis kii or shivaji ke rajbhishek ke baad bhi puna ke brahmanon ko dhamkee di kaha ki shivaji ko raja maanane se manaa karo
 taaki praja bhi ise na maane !! lekin unki nahin chali
 shivaji ne ashtapradhan mandal kii sthapana kii
 vibhinn rajyon ke duuton, pratinidhiyon ke alaava videshi vyapaariyon ko bhi is samaaroh main aamantrit kiya gaya
 But 12 days after his coronation, his mother had died, for this reason, on 4 October 1674, Shivaji assumed the title of Chhatrapati for the second time
 do baar hue is samaaroh main lagbhag 50 lakh rupee kharch hue
 The establishment of Hindu Swaraj was announced in this ceremony
 vijaynagar ke patan ke baad dakshin main yah pehla hindu samrajya tha
 Like an independent ruler, he introduced a coin in his name
 iske baad bijapur ke sultan ne konkan vijay ke liye apane do senadhishon ko shivaji ke viruddh bheja par ve asafal rahe
 In 1677–78, Shivaji's attention shifted to Karnataka
 bombay ke dakshin main konkan, tungabhadra nadi ke pashchim main belgaum tathaa dharwar kaa kshetra, mysore, vailari, trichur tathaa zinji par adhikaar karne ke baad 4 april, 1680 ko shivaji kaa dehant ho gaya
 Shivaji died on 3 April 1680 after three weeks of illness
 us samay shivaji ke uttaradhikaar sambhaji ko mili
 Shivaji had the eldest son Sambhaji and a second son named Rajaram from his consort
 us samay rajaraam kii umr maatr 10 varsh thi atah maraathon ne shambhaji ko raja maan liya
 Seeing the demise of Aurangzeb King Shivaji at that time, with the desire to rule his whole India, he went out to conquer South India with his 500,000 army
 aurangzeb ne dakshin main atehi adilshaahi 2 dino main ore qutubashhi 1 hi dino main khatam kar di
 But the Marathas, under the leadership of King Sambhaji, maintained their independence while fighting for 9 years
 aurangzeb ke putr shahjada akbar ne aurangzeb ke kilaaf vidroh kar diya
 Sambhaji gave him shelter in his place
 aurangzeb ne ab phir joardaar tareeke se sambhaji ke kilaaf akraman karnaa shuru kiya
 Finally, in 1689, Sambhaji's wife's brother, Sambhaji, by the mouth of Ganji Shirke, made Sambhaji a prisoner by Mukarav Khan
 aurangzeb ne raja sambhaji se badasluki kii or bura haal kar ke maar diya
 Seeing his king being mistreated by Aurangzeb and badly hit, the Pura Maratha Swarajya became angry
 unhone apni puri takat se teesraa rajaraam ke netritv main mughalon se sangharsh jari rakhaa
 Rajaram died in 1700 AD
 uske baad rajaraam kii patni tarabai 4 varshiya putr shivaji dwitiya kii sangrakshika banakar raaj karti rahi
 Ultimately 25 years of tired Maratha war fighting of the kingdom was buried in the self-rule of Shivaji, the same chhatrapati of Aurangzeb
 shivaji ko ek kushal or prabud samraat ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Although he did not get much traditional education in his childhood, he was familiar with Indian history and politics
 unhone shukracharya tathaa kautilya ko adarsh maanakar kootneeti kaa sahaara lenaa kai baar uchit samajha tha
 Like his contemporary Mughals, he was also an autocratic ruler, that is, the entire reins of governance were in the hands of the king
 par unke prashaskeey kaaryon main madad ke liye aath mantriyon kii ek parishad thi jinhen ashtapradhan kaha jaataa tha
 In this, the head of the ministers was called Peshwa, who was the most prominent figure after the king
 amaatya vitt or rajasav ke kaaryon ko dekhtaa tha to mantri raja kii vyaktigat dainandini kaa khyal rakhaata tha
 The secretaries worked in the office, which included the royal seal and drafting treaty letters
 sumant videsh mantri tha
 The head of the army was called the commander
 daan or dharmik maamalon ke pramukh ko panditrao kehete the
 The judge was the head of judicial affairs
 maratha samrajya teen yaa chaar vibhaagon main vibhakt tha
 Each province had a subedar called the Prantapati
 harek soobedaar ke paas bhi ek ashtapradhan samiti hoti thi
 Some provinces were only taxpayers and independent in terms of administration
 nyaayavyavastha pracheen paddati par aadhaarit thi
 Shukracharya, Kautilya and Hindu theology were judged as the basis
 gaanv ke patel faujadaari mukademon kii jaanch karte the
 The means of income of the state were landless, but revenue was also charged from Chauth and Sardeshmukhi
 'chouth' padosi rajyon kii suraksha kii guarantee ke liye vasule jane vaala kar tha
 Shivaji used to call himself the Sardeshmukh of the Marathas and in this capacity, Sardeshmukhi tax was collected
 rajbhishek ke baad unhone apane ek mantri ko shaskeey upyog main aane vaale farsi shabdon ke liye upyukt sanskrit shabd nirmit karne kaa kaary saunpa
 Ramchandra Amatya, with the help of a scholar named Dhundhiraja, composed a book called 'rajyavarthakosh'
 is kosh main 1380 farsi ke prashasnic shabdon ke tulya sanskrit shabd the
 Ramchandra has written in it- shivaji ek samarpit hindu the tathaa vah dharmik sahishnu bhi the
 Muslims had religious freedom in their empire
 kai masjidon ke nirmaan ke liye shivaji ne anudaan diya
 Like Hindu Pandits, Muslim saints and fakirs were also respected
 unki sena main musalmaan sainik bhi the
 Shivaji used to promote Hindu culture
 parmparik hindu mulyon tathaa shiksha par bal diya jaataa tha
 He also started his campaigns often on the occasion of Dussehra
 shivaji maharaj ko apane pita se swaraj kii shiksha hi mili jab bijapur ke sultan ne shahji raaje ko bandi bana liya to ek adarsh putr kii tarah unhone bijapur ke shah se sandhi kar shahji raaje ko chhudvaa liya
 This brings a generous element to his character
 usek baad unhone pita kii hatya nahin karwaai jaisaa ki anya samraat kiya karte the
 He got his coronation only after the death of Shahaji Raje, although by that time he had become independent of his father and became the ruler of a large empire
 unke netritv ko sab log sweekaar karte the yahi kaaran he ki unke shasankaal main koi aantarik vidroh jaisi pramukh ghatana nahin hui thi
 He was also a good diplomat with a good commander
 kai jagahon par unhone sidhe yuddh ladane kii bajaay yuddh se bhaag liya tha
 But this was his diplomacy, which always supported him in defeating the biggest enemy
 shivaji maharaj kii "ganimi kawa" naamak kootneeti, jisamen shatru par achaanak akraman karke use haraaya jaataa he, vilobhaniyata se or aadarsahit yaad kiya jaataa he
 These lines are famous in Shivaji Maharaj's pride- bharat ke pradhanmantri kaa karyaalay se aashay bharat ke pradhanmantri ke sidhe neeche aane vaale najdiki adhikariyon or karmchaariyon ke samooh se he

 Severe malaria can also lead to unconsciousness or death, the risk of this happening in young children and pregnant women is very high
 atyant gambhir maamalon main mrityu kuch ghanton tak main ho sakati he
 In severe cases, mortality can be as high as 20% even if treated appropriately
 mahamari vaale kshetra me praaia upachaar santoshjanak nahin ho paata, atah mrityu dar kaaphi unchi hoti he or malaria ke prayek 10 marijon main se 1 mrityu ko praapt hota he
 Malaria can cause severe damage to the developing brain of young children

 The extremities twitch awkwardly in the event of excessive damage
 deergh kaal main gambhir malaria se ubre bacchon main akasar alp maansik vikaas dekha jaataa he
 Pregnant women are very attractive to mosquitoes and can result from malaria until pregnancy death, low birth weight and infant death
 mukhyatya yah pi

 vivax bhi aisa kar saktaa he
 P
 vivax and P
 ovale parasites can remain hidden in the liver for years
 atah rakt se rog mit jane par bhi rog se purnataya mukti mil gai he aisa maan lenaa galat he
 Malaria can occur again up to 30 years after infection with P

 Malaria is spread by protozoa parasites of Plasmodium gana
 is gana ke chaar sadsy manushyon ko sankramit karte hai- plasmodium failciparum, plasmodium vivax, plasmodium ovel tathaa plasmodium malarie
 The most dangerous of these is believed to be P
 falciparum, which accounts for 80 percent of malaria cases and 90 percent of deaths
 yah paraseete pakshiyon, rengne vaale jeevon, bandaron, chimpaziyon tathaa chuhon ko bhi sankramit karata he
 Infections in humans are also known by many other types of plasmodium, but are negligible except for P
 naulesi
 pakshiyon main paae jane vaale malaria se murgiyaan mar sakati hai lekin isse murgi-paalkon ko adhik nuksaan hota nahin paaya gaya he
 When the disease reached the Hawaiian Islands with humans, many of the bird species there were destroyed by it because they had no natural resistance against it
 malaria paraseete kii praathmik poshak maadaa anopheleas machhar hoti he, joki malaria kaa sankraman failaane main bhi madad karti he
 Mosquitoes of Anopheles gans are spread all over the world
 keval maadaa machhar khun se poshan leti he, atah yah hi vaahak hoti he naa ki nar
 The female mosquito anopheles bites at night
 shaam hote hi yah shikaar kii talash me nikal padati he tathaa tab tak gumti he jab tak shikaar mil nahin jaataa
 It lays eggs in standing water
 andon or unase nikalne vaale larva donon ko pani kii atyant sakht zarurat hoti he
 Additionally, larvae have to repeatedly come to the surface of the water to breathe
 andey-larva-pupa or phir vayask hone main machhar lagbhag 10-14 din kaa samay lete hai
 Adult mosquitoes thrive on pollen and other sugary foods, but female mosquitoes need blood to lay eggs
 malaria paraseete kaa pehla shikaar tathaa vaahak maadaa anopheleas machhar banati he
 Young mosquitoes take the malaria parasite from its blood upon biting the infected human
 rakt main maujuud paraseete ke jananaanu machhar ke pet main nar or maadaa ke rup main viksit ho jate hai or phir milakar andanu bana lete hai jo machhar kii antadiyon kii diwaar main palane lagate hai
 When they mature, they burst and the spores that come out of it reach the salivary glands of that mosquito
 machhar phir jab swasth manushya ko katata he to twachaa main laar ke saath-saath bijaanu bhi bhej detaa he
 These spores in the human body then germinate to form germs, which then spread the infection further
 iske alaava malaria sankramit rakt ko chadhaane se bhi fail saktaa he, lekin aisa hona bahut asaadhaaran he
 The development of malaria parasites in humans takes place in two stages: first stage in liver and second stage in red blood cells
 jab ek sankramit machhar maanav ko katata he to bijaanu maanav rakt main pravesh kar yakrut main pahonchte hai or sharir main pravesh paane ke 30 minute ke bheetar yakrut kii koshikaon ko sankramit kar dete hai
 Then they start asexual reproduction in the liver
 yah charan 6 se 15 din chalata he
 Thousands of bacteria are formed from this germ which break into their guest cells and enter the blood and start infecting red blood cells
 isse rog kaa doosraa charan shuru hota he
 Some spores of P
 vivax and P
 ovale infect the liver and stop and become inactive as crypts
 ye 6 se 12 maas tak niskriy rah kar phir achaanak anshaanuon ke rup main prakat ho jate hai or rog paidaa kar dete hai
 These parasites keep re-multiplying themselves by entering the red blood cell
 ye valay rup main viksit hokar phir bhojau or phir bahunabhikeey shysont or phir anekon anshaanu bana dete hai
 From time to time, these bacteria break down nutrient cells and infect new red blood cells
 aise kai charan chalate hai
 Fever attacks in malaria cause thousands of bacteria to affect new red blood cells simultaneously
 malaria paraseete apane jivan kaa lagbhag sabhi samay yakrut kii koshikaon yaa laal rakt koshikaon main chupa rahakar bitaata he, isliye maanav sharir ke pratiraksha tantra se bachaa rah jaataa he
 P
 falciparum is another trick to avoid damage to the spleen - it causes a sticky protein to appear on the surface of the red blood cell causing the infected blood cells to stick to the small blood vessels and not reach the spleen
 
 is kaaran raktadhara main keval valay rup hi dikhte hai, anya sabhi vikaas ke charnon main yah choti rakt vahikaaon kii satahon main chipka rahata he
 Due to this stickiness, malaria causes bleeding problems
 yadhyapi sankramit laal rakt koshika kii sataha par pradarshit protein piefiempi1 sharir ke pratiraksha tantra kaa shikaar ban saktaa he, aisa hota nahin he kyonki is protein main vividhta bahut zyada hoti he
 Each parasite has 60 types of it, while all of them can display this protein in myriad forms
 ve baar baar is protein ko badal kar sharir ke pratiraksha tantra se ek kadam aage rahete hai
 Some bacteria turn into male-female genomes and when the mosquito bites, carries them with blood
 yahan ve phir se apana jivan chakra puraa karte hai
 In many malaria-prone areas, every patient with fever is given a presumptive diagnosis of malaria and treatment is started with quinine
 iske saath hi rakt kii patticas bhi bana lee jaati hai, lekin ilaaj shuru karne ke liye iske parinaamon kii pratiksha nahin kii jaati
 This is also done in many areas where facilities for general laboratory tests are not available
 lekin malawi main hua ek adhyayan bataata he ki bukhaar ke saath-saath yadi guda kaa taapmaana, nakhunon main raktaheenata or tilli ke aakaar ko bhi dhyaan main liya jaae to malaria ke anaavashyak upachaar se bahut bachaa ja saktaa he 
 )
 rakt patticoon kaa sookshmdarshi se pareekshan karnaa malaria ke nidaan kaa sabase sasta, acha tathaa bharosemand tarika mana jaataa he
 The specific symptoms of the four malaria parasites can be diagnosed separately by this test
 rakt patticas do tarah se banaai jaati hai - patali or moti
 Thin plaques can better protect the parasite's texture, on the other hand, thicker plaques can allow more blood to be checked in less time and a lower volume of infection can be diagnosed

 malaria ke nidaan ke liye anek antigen-aadhaarit dipstick pareekshan yaa malaria rapid antigen test bhi uplabdh hai
 They require only one drop of blood, and in just 15–20 minutes, the result is not required, laboratory is not required
 ye sookshmdarshi jaanch se thode kamatar maane jate he
 But in areas where microscopic examination facilities are not available or the examiners do not experience the diagnosis of malaria, antigen testing can be done with a drop of blood in the affected area
 sabase pehle in pareekshanon kaa vikaas pi
 failciparum ke kinvak glutamet deehydrogenez ko antigen ke rup main prayog karke kiya gaya
 But soon a test called optimal-it was developed using another enzyme lactate dehydrogenase

 Additionally, P
 falciparum can diagnose up to 0
002 percent of malaria parasites in the parachoc-pf blood based on specific histidine-rich proteins, but does not distinguish between falciparum and non-falciparum malaria
 inke atirikt polimarez shrinkhalaa abhikriya kaa prayog karke or aanvik vidhiyon ke prayog se bhi kuch pareekshan viksit kiye gaye hai, lekin ye abhi kaaphi mahange hai, tathaa keval vishisht prayogshaalaon main hi uplabdh hai
 There is still a need to develop cheap, sensory and simple tests that can be used to diagnose malaria in the region
 gambhir malaria ko africa me praayah pahchaan lene main galati hoti he, jiske chalate anya pranaghatak bimariyon kaa ilaaj bhi nahin ho paata he
 The presence of parasites in the blood can be caused not only by severe malaria, but also by many other deadly diseases
 haal ke adhyayan bataate hai ki malaria-janit moorchha or gaiyr-malaria-janit moorchha main antar karne ke liye malarial retinopathy kisi bhi anya pareekshan se behatar he
 Some cases of malaria are emergencies and it is mandatory to keep the patient under observation until they are completely healthy, but in other types of malaria it is not necessary, treatment can be done in outpatients
 uchit ilaaj hone par marij bilkul thik ho jaataa he
 Some symptoms are treated with normal medicines, along with anti-malarial drugs

 Many drugs are used only for resistance or treatment only, while others can be used both ways
 kuch davaayen ek-duusare ke prabhaav ko badhaati hai or inkaa prayog saath main kiya jaataa he
 Resistant drugs are often used collectively
 kunain par aadhaarit anek aushadhiyon ko malaria kaa acha upachaar samajha jaataa he
 Additionally, drugs such as artemisinin, which are prepared from a plant called Artemisia annua, have been found effective in treating malaria
 kuch anya aushadhiyon kaa prayog bhi malaria ke viruddh safal hua he
 Experimentation on some drugs is in progress
 dawa ke chunaav main sabase pramukh kaarak hota he us kshetra main malaria paraseete kin dawaaon ke prati pratirodh viksit kar chukaa he
 Many medicines which were earlier considered successful against malaria are not considered successful nowadays because malaria parasites have gradually acquired immunity against them
 homeopathy main malaria kaa upachaar uplabdh he, haalanki anek chikitsakon kaa maananaa he ki malaria jaisi gambhir beemaari kaa ilaaj allopathic dawaaon se hi kiya janaa chaiye, kyonki ye vaigyanik shodh par aadhaarit hai
 Even the advice of the British Homeopathic Association is that homeopathy should not be depended on for the treatment of malaria
 ayurveda main malaria ko visham fever kaha jaataa he or iske upachaar ke liye anek aushadhiyaan uplabdh hai
 Although effective treatment of malaria is available today, in many underdeveloped regions of the world, it is either not available in malaria affected areas or is so expensive that the common patient is unable to use it
 malaria kii dawaaon kii badhati maang ko dekhakar anek prabhavit deshon me bade paimaane par nakli dawaaon kaa kaarobaar hota he, jo anek mrityuon kaa kaaran banataa he
 Nowadays companies are trying to tackle this problem by using new techniques
 malaria kaa prasar in karkon par nirbhar karata he- maanav jansankhya kaa ghanatv, machharon kii jansankhya kaa ghanatv, machharon se manushyon tak prasar or manushyon se machharon tak prasar
 If any one of these factors is reduced too much, then malaria can be eradicated from that area
 isiliye malaria prabhavit kshetron me rog kaa prasar rokane hetu dawaaon ke saath-saath machharon kaa unmoolan yaa unase kaatane se bachane ke upaay kiye jate hai
 Many researchers claim that the cost of prevention against malaria treatment will be less in the long run
 1956-1960 ke dashak me vishwa str par malaria unmoolan ke vyapak prayaas kiye gayi 
 But they could not succeed and malaria is still present in Africa at the same level
 machharon ke prajnan sthalon ko nasht karke malaria par bahut niyantran paaya ja saktaa he
 Mosquitoes breed in standing water, such standing water spaces should be covered, dried or drained or oil should be applied on the surface of the water, so that the mosquito larvae cannot breathe
 iske atirikt malaria-prabhavit kshetron main akasar gharon kii deevaaron par kitnashak dawaaon kaa chhidkaav kiya jaataa he
 Mosquitoes of many species digest the human's blood after sitting on the wall
 aise main agar deevaaron par kitnashkon kaa chhidkaav kar diya jaae to diwaar par baithte hi machhar mar jayega, kisi or manushya ko kaatane ke pehle hi

 a lubricant is a material that is applied between two moving surfaces to reduce friction between them, improve efficiency and not wear out quickly
 It may have the function of dissolving or transporting foreign particles and the distribution of heat
 lubricant ke liye ekal sabase bade prayojanon main ek he, motor oil ke rup main, motor vaahanon or vidyut chaalit upkarnon main aantarik dahan ingine kii suraksha
 Typically lubricants contain 90% base oil and less than 10% additives
 kabhi-kabhi base oil ke rup main vanaspati tel yaa hydrogen se yukt polyolefins, aster, silicon, flourocarbon jaise synthetic drav or kai anya synthetic taral padaarthon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Additives cause less friction and wear, increased viscosity, improved viscosity index, resistance to corrosion and oxidation, aging or contamination, etc
 2-saaikal oil jaise lubricant bhi kuch indhanon main milaae jate hai
 Sulfur impurities in fuels provide some lubricating properties, which have to be taken into account when changing to low-sulfur diesel; Biodiesel is a popular diesel fuel additive that provides additional smoothness
 gaiyr-taral lubricanton main shaamil hai greez, powder, nalsaazi main prayukt tefflon tepe, air kushan or anya
 grefite, molybdenum dicelphid, tungston dicelphid jaise sookhe lubricant, taral or tel-aadhaarit lubricanton kii sanchaalan kshamta kii tulana main ucch taapmaana chiknayee pradaan karte hai
 Limited interest has been observed in the low friction properties of solid oxide glaze levels formed at several hundred degrees Celsius in metallic sliding systems, however, their practical use is many years away due to their physically unstable nature
 gharshan or ghisaav kam karne ke liye ek or drushtikon he ball bering, roller bering yaa air bering jaise beringon kaa upyog, jinke liye badale main aantarik chiknayee kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, yaa acustic lubrication ke maamle main, dhwani kaa upyog
 In addition to industrial applications, lubricants are used for many other purposes
 anya upyogon main shaamil hai khaanaa pakaana, maanvon par jaev-chikitsiya prayojan, ultra-sound pareekshan, purushon or mahilaon ke liye aantarik pareekshan or yon prayojanon ke liye vyaktigat lubricant kaa istemaal
 Lubricants perform the following important functions
 aam taur par lubricant ko kisi pranali main gatisheel bhaagon ko alag rakhane ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 This has the advantage of reducing surface labor while reducing friction and heat generation, operating noise and vibration
 lubricant ise kai tareekon se hasil karte hai
 The most common is by the formation of a physical barrier, ie the lubricant separates the moving parts
 ise hydrodinamik lubrication kaha jaataa he
 At high surface pressures or temperatures the fluid layer is very thin and some forces are transmitted to the surfaces through the lubricant
 ise elasto-hydrodinamik lubrication kaha jaataa he
 Lubricant-to-surface friction is generally less than surface-to-surface friction in any system of lubricant
 is prakaar lubricant kaa upyog samgr pranali ke gharshan ko kam kar detaa he
 Low friction has the advantage of low heat generation and low formation of wear particles as well as improved efficiency
 Lubricants may include additives called friction modifiers that chemically bind solid surfaces to reduce surface friction, even when there is insufficient bulk lubricant for hydrodynamic lubrication, e
g
 Protection of valve train in car engine at start-up
 donon gas or taral lubricant taap antarit kar sakate hai
 However, liquid lubricants are more effective due to their high specific heat capacity
 aam taur par taral lubricant pranali ke cooler bhaag se or usamen parichaalit hota he, haalanki lubricant kaa istemaal garm tathaa thande karne ke liye ho saktaa he jab niyantrit taapmaana kii aavashyaktaa ho
 yah parisanchari pravaah kisi niyat samay main ikai main dur jane vaale taap kii maatra bhi nirdhaarit karata he
 High flow systems can carry a lot of heat and also have the added benefit of reducing thermal stress on the lubricant
 is tarah kam laagat vaale taral lubricant kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 The primary drawback is that large flows typically require large caps and large cooling units
 ek gaun dosha yah he ki ucch pravaah pranali jo lubricant ko thermal tanaav se bachaane ke liye pravaah dar par nirbhar karti he, achaanak pranali ke band hone par vipattipurna vifaltaa ke liye atisamvedansheel he
 a typical example is an automotive oil-cooled turbo charger
 terbocharger sanchaalan ke dauraan garm laal ho jate hai or unhen thanda karne vaala tel batch rahata he kyonki pranali main uskaa rahane kaa samay bahut kam he arthath ucch pravaah dar
 yadi pranali ko achaanak band kar diya jaae terbo charger main maujuud tel kaa turant oxikaran hota he or nikshep sahit tel margon ko avaruddh karegaa
 samay ke saath shitalan kam karte hue, ye nikshep tel margon ko puri tarah avaruddh kar sakate hai, jiske parinamswaroop jam beringon ke saath aam taur par terbo charger puri tarah band ho jaataa he
 Non-flowing lubricants such as grease and paste are not effective during heat transfer, although at first they contribute by reducing heat generation
 lubricant sancharan pranaaliyon se aantarik rup se janit malbe or pranali main aane vaale bahya dooshit padaarthon ko dur le jane kaa laabh he, jo filter main pahunchate hai jahaan se unhen hataaya ja saktaa he
 Lubricants for machines that routinely generate debris or contaminants such as automotive engines typically include detergents and dispersed additives to transport and remove debris and contaminants to the filter
 samay ke saath filter bhar jayega or safaai yaa use badalane kii zarurat hogi, atah sifarish kii jaati he ki car main tel badalte samay oil filter bhi badal daalen
 gear box jaisi band pranaaliyon main filter main chumbak anupoorak shaamil ho saktaa he taaki utpann baariq lohe ke chure aakarshith ho jaaen
 It is clear that oil in a communications system can only be as clean as the filter can make it, thus it is unfortunate that no industry standards exist that allow consumers to easily evaluate the filtering ability of various automotive filters
 Can
 Poor filtration specifically reduces the life of the machine as well as disables the system
 hydrolic taral ke rup main gyaat lubricant kaa upyog hydrostatic vidyut sanchaar main kaaryakari taral padaarth ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Hydraulic fluids comprise a large fraction of all lubricants produced worldwide
 swat: sancharan kaa anthan parivartak lubricant ke saath vidyut pareshan ke liye ek or mahatvapurn prayojan he
 Lubricants prevent rubbing by keeping the moving parts separate
 lubricant main ragad-rodhi yaa atyadhik dabaav vaale yojak bhi ho sakate hai jo ragad or shram ke prati unke nishpaadan ko badhaava dete hai
 Generally good quality lubricants are formulated with additives that form chemical bonds with surfaces to prevent corrosion and rusting
 lubricant gatisheel hisson ke bich keshika bal ke zarie nikasi ko gherta he, jisase nikasi band ho jaati he
 This effect can be used to seal pistons and shafts
 romavaasi wagon ke pahiyon ko chikna karne ke liye pashuon kii vasa main duube chithdon kaa istemaal karte the; tathaapi chiknayee kaa vigyaan vastav main keval unnisvin sadi main audyogic kranti ke saath aage badha
 Typically lubricants are made with more base oil and some additives for the required characteristics
 taral lubricanton kii tulana main gasiy lubricant main bahut kam chipchipahat or adhik sampeden hoti he, lekin taral-jhilli siddhant gaison ke samroop lagu hote hai
 Some examples of gaseous lubricants are air, technical gases, steam or liquid-metal vapor
 taral lubricant ke lakshan kai alag tareekon se varnit kiye ja sakate hai
 One of the most common methods is by the type of base oil used
 The following are the most common types
 note: haalanki aam taur par lubricant ek yaa duusare prakaar ke base oil par aadhaarit hai, yah sambhav he ki nishpaadan apekshaaon kii purti ke liye base oil ke mishranon kaa istemaal kiya jaae
 a natural water repellent, lanolin is derived from sheep wool grease and is an alternative to the more common petrochemical-based lubricants
 yah lubricant zang nirodhak bhi he, jo zang, lavan or amlon se raksha karata he
 Water itself can be used, or in combination with any other base oil, as a major component
 saamanytah milling or leath terning jaisi ejineering prakriyaaon main prayukt hota he
 The term is used to describe lubricating base oil derived from crude oil
 american petroleum institute vibhinn prakaar ke lubricant base oil ko nirdisht karata he jinaki nimna rup main pahchaan kii gai he: Such as naphthenics, PAG, esters, etc
 lubricant udyog saamanytah is samooh shabdaawalee ko nimna shaamil karne ke liye vistrut karti he: Can be classified into three categories based on the prevailing structures: ye mukhya rup se paudhon or jaanwaron se praapt triglisride aster hai
 Vegetable derived material is preferred for the use of lubricant base oil
 aam telon main shaamil hai ucch oleik canola tel, arandi kaa tel, palm tel, surajamukhi ke bijon kaa tel, vanaspati se repasid tel or pashu sroton se tol tel

 Under extreme pressure, teflon powder or solid is of no value, as it softens and flows away from the contact area
 tab chini mitti yaa dhaatu yaa mishra dhaatu lubricant kaa upyog kiya janaa chahie
 Graphite, hexagonal boron nitride, molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide are examples of materials that can be used as solid lubricants to much higher temperatures than normal
 kuch aisi saamagree kaa upyog kabhi-kabhi unke karaab oxikaran pratirodh dwaara pratibandhit ho jaataa he 
 Metal alloys, composite and pure metals can be used as grease additives or as a single component of sliding surfaces and bearings
 cadmium or sona, satahon par chadhaane ke liye istemaal hote hai jo unhen acha gharshan pratirodh or sarakan gun pradaan karte hai, sisa, tin, zinc mishra-dhaatu or vibhinn kaansya mishra-dhaatuon kaa upyog phisalane vaale bering ke liye istemaal hota he, yaa unke powder ko keval phisalane vaali satahon ko chikna banane ke liye, yaa greezon main yojak ke rup main prayog main laa sakate hai
 Another phenomenon on which research has been done in high temperature breakdown prevention and lubrication is 'layer climbing'
 It is the generation of a solid oxide layer, which normally accumulates at high temperatures, with metal surfaces sliding against each other to form a crystalline 'layer'
 Friction and wear can be reduced due to the avoidance of metal contact and adhesion by the production of oxides
 prabhavi rup se, is tarah kii sataha swa-chiknayee vaali hoti he
 Since the 'layer' is already an oxide, it can survive at very high temperatures in air or oxidizing environments
 tathaapi, aadhaar dhaatu ke liye zaruri hone kii vajah se ise asuvidha he ki paryaapt oxide malba utpann karne ke liye pehle ise tut-foot se guzaranaa hoga
 a large number of additives are used to provide performance characteristics to the lubricant
 yojakon ke mukhya parivaar hai: Note that many basic chemical compounds that are used as detergents also serve as the purpose of the first seven items in the list
 aam taur par aarthik rup se yaa takneekee rup se sab kaam ke liye ek yojak mishran kaa prayog vyavhaarya nahin he
 Oil has a high content of EP additives for hypoid gear lubrication
 greez lubricant main adhik maatra main grefite, molybdenum salphid, aadi jaise gharshan parivartak thos kan shaamil ho sakate hai
 The global lubricant market typically competes with many manufacturers and vendors
 samagratah pashchimi bazaar ko mandi se lekar samgr maatra kii giravat ke saath paripakv mana ja saktaa he jabaki ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon main majboot vikaas he
 Lubricant marketers generally follow any or many of the following strategies --- when doing business
 lubricant kathith taur par ek nishchit vinirdesh ko puraa karata he
 In the consumer market, this is often supported by a logo, symbol, or words that inform consumers that the lubricant marketer has done independent verification of conformance to the specification

 This interpretation is based on the title and country of the book, and is a clear confusion between the Greek "no place" and "good place"
 "utopie" shabdaansh ou – jiskaa arth he "nahin" or topoj jiskaa arth he sthaan kaa ek yogic he
 But the homophonic prefix eu - meaning "good" is also resonated in the word, with the implication that "good place" as a whole is actually "no place"
 '' The second version of this concept dates back to the 3rd century BC
 The author of the book "sacred History" by Euhemirus is found in Panchia Island

 Their common characteristics: an egalitarian distribution of goods, often with the total elimination of money and citizens doing the same things they enjoy and giving enough time for the promotion of arts and sciences for the good of all - due to These were often absorbed into a larger "utopian socialist" movement

 Another idea that capitalist utopias do not address is the issue of market failure, much more social utopias address the issue of planning failure
 isliye samaajwaad or poonjeevaad ke mishran ko kuch logon dwaara ek adarsh rajya main arthshaastra ke prakaar ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Such an idea, for example, employs small community-owned industries under a market-based format of economics
