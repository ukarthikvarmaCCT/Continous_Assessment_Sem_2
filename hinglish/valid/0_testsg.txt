 unke anusaar drushti, shravan, ghran, sparsh, swaad or mastishk yaa man - ye chha: indriyaan gyaan prapti main sahaayak hoti hai
 Apart from the mind, all other senses depend on the physical components of the eye, ear, vasika, skin and linga respectively for their actions

 Mrs
 Anne Besant has also supported the ideal of celibacy

 The task of education is to impart knowledge of your soul to the child which is more real than the physical body

 Mahatma Gandhi believed that God is the ultimate reality in this world

 The aim of education is to enable children to know God and to recognize 'soul'
 ve dharm ke parimparaagat rup kaa virodh karte the or chaahate the ki balak dharm ke vaastavik swaroop ko samajhen or apane din-pratidin ke jivan main uskaa abhyaas karen
 He has not neglected moral and spiritual education
 maharishi aravind ne hamen alokik mastishk kii bhaavana pradaan kii he jo vartmaan evam sambhavy sthitiyon, `swatantra or sambandhit' tathaa `gyaan or agyaan' ke do goladhon ko milaati he
 This is an idealistic view
 ve mastishk ko chaar tahon--chitt, manas buddhi or satya ke antargyaan se yukt maanate he
 According to him, real education enters the human soul and enables the child to develop his intellectual and moral abilities to the highest extent
 bhartiya shiksha-shastriyon ke vichaar prakrutwad kii bedi main jakade nahin he
 While he has preached to take education from nature and advised to follow the natural laws, he has also pointed to the creator of nature

 Purposeism is a new sect of philosophy that originated from the American way of life
 phir bhi kuch prayojanavaadee pravritiyaan bhartiya vichaarkon ke shiksha sambandhi vichaaron main bhi sugamawapurvak paayi ja sakati hai
 For example, Swami Dayanand was obsessed with the social needs of the country and wanted to create an education plan suited to these needs
 unke shiksha-sambandhi kaarykram main vyakti ke vyaavhaarik anubhav sammilit hai
 Swami Vivekananda supports collective education and says that education should not be neglected by the needs of the general public in the country
 shiksha main jivan ke vyaavhaarik paksh par dhyaan dena aavashyak he
 This education is meaningless, whose goal is not to make children eligible to become useful to society
 shrimati eni besaint hindu samaaj kii tatkaaleen dashaon se prasann nahin thim or unhone samaaj se sudhaar karne hetu apana jivan samarpati kar diya
 He supported the idea that education should be all oriented
 unke anusaar balak main karttavya kii bhaavana utpann kii jaani chahie jisase usamen saamaajik chetana kaa vikaas ho sake or vah apane mata-pita, bahinon or bhaaiyon ke prati apane karttavyon kaa paalan kar sake
 The English version of American Puritanism is commonly called 'humanism' and in a previous chapter we have described that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore was a great humanist
 unhone manushya ko samast vastuon kaa maapdand mana he
 His theory of culture was also human
 tagore ishwar ko bhi maanav maanate the
 Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya was a man of practical intelligence
 jivan ke prati unka vahi maanavtaavaadi drushtikon tha jo ki prayojanavaad kaa aadhaar he
 He was conscious of social needs and wanted to improve the society
 unke anusaar, saamaajik buraaiyon kaa kaaran hindootv ke kuch saanskrithik aadarshon kii avhelnaa thi
 Therefore, he worked for Hinduism and founded the Kashi Hindu University to give practical form to his educational ideas
 mahatma gandhi nissandeh ek adarshavaadi the or `param shakti' main unka drudh vishwaas tha
 But he did not ignore the practical side of life
 unhone apane sampoorn jivan ko satya ke saath ek prayog mana he
 Experiment and experience are fundamental elements of Purposeism
 unhone keval unheen siddhanton kaa samarthan kiya jinako unhone swayan kaaryrup main parinat kiya
 From this point of view he can also be called a Puritanist
 maharishi aravind ghosh saarvbhaumik mastishk main vishwaas karte the or hardik bhav se adarshavaadi the kintu unhone kabhi bhi apane adarshavaad ke vyaavhaarik paksh ko upeksha kii drushti se nahin dekha
 He said that the curriculum should be based on children's interests and should be useful to them in real life
 shiksha-yojana main shikshak kaa sthaan nirdeshak or mitra ke rup main hona chahie
 This idea of his is similar to the ideas of the Purists
 bhartiya rashtriya charitra ke bilkool anukool, samakaleen bhartiya shiksha or shiksha-darshan kii prakruti sanshleshak he
 We are certainly advocates of idealistic philosophy in all fields of education
 kintu yah adarshavaadi drushtikon samay-samay par anek or vividh prakaar ke darshanik vichaaron se prabhavit hua he
 The national character is so quickly changing due to contemporary changes
 vigyaan par aadhaarit aadhunik udyogon ke aagaman or saath main teevr saamaajik parivartanon ke kaaran shaikshik samasyaon main bahut se parivartan hue hai
 But in a changing world, learning only the method of earning a living cannot be the goal of education
 shaikshik uddeshy ke antargat isse adhik apekshaayen hai
 Some people believe that the only way to train children for variable times is to provide them with education that is automatically "developing"
 udaahranarth, divi kaa aadesh he ki manushya ko sadaiv apane parivartansheel vaataavaran ke prati jaagruk tathaa us vaataavaran ke dwaara satat utpann hone vaali samasyaon ke samaadhaan main kriyasheel hona chahie
 There are others who believe that a plan of study designed to be the focal point of fundamental and perpetual truth provides a high degree of stability, a candidate for humanity
 iske atirikt yah maanate hue ki ham vishuddh or drudh adarshavaadi hai, ham bharatvasiyon kaa adarshavaadi siddhanth ek vistrut or sarvyaapee siddhanth he
 Under this, various sects are included and thus this principle has always been praised in a very extreme form
 vah vyakti or samaaj ke aadhyatmik unnayan kaa sabal aadhaar rahaa he
 Practicalism in its extreme form also gives the message of always making progress towards the uncertain direction
 bhartiya shiksha-shastri prayonavadi kii bhanti pragati kaa sandesh to dete hai kintu vyakti va samaaj kii jivan-nauka ko aspasht disha kii ore na sanchalit kar sunishchit disha kii ore sanchalit karne kaa paraamarsh dete hai
 Western realists have given the message of the world to be on a solid and precise plane
 yathartwaadee vichaarak vyaavhaarik jagat kii upeksha sahan nahin karata
 Indian philosophers have also accepted the practical power of the world
 jagat ko maaya maanane vaale acharya shankar ne bhi jagat ko vyaavhaarik drushti se satya mana he
 Indian thinkers believe that despite being proficient in the scriptures, a man separated from behavior is a fool
 haan, yah baat avashya he ki bhartiya shiksha-shastri lokvyavahaar ko nitant satya nahin maanate
 It has power only to a extent
 aadhyatmikta kii keemat chukaa kar loukikta unhen grhya nahin
 The criterion of evaluation of this cosmic world is considered to be spiritual elevation
 at: bhartiya shiksha-shastri yathartwaadee drushtikon apanaakar bhi yatharthwaad kii bhoomi se bahut upar uth jaataa he
 Purposeism is the link between idealism and naturalism
 jo vyakti prakrutivaadee he vah prayojanavaadee athwa adarshavaadi nahin ho saktaa
 But the person who walks on the path to realism has to cross the objectiveism somewhere
 prakrutwad se adarshavaad tak kii duuri tay karne main prayojanavaad maarg main aata hi he
 From this point of view, all Indian academics can be called objectiveists in one form or the other
 mahatma gandhi main to apane sampoorn tatva hai
 In his book, Mahatma Gandhi's Philosophy of Education, the ideas Dr
 MS Patel has expressed about Gandhi are also applicable to other Indian academics to a large extent
 da
 Patel writes first
 "gandhi ji ke darshan kaa saavdhaanee ke saath adhyayan kare par yah spasht ho jaayga ki unke shikshadarshan main prakrutwad, adarshavaad evam prayojanavaad sahaayak hai -- gandhi ji kaa shiksha-darshan paryaapt maatra main prakrutivaadee he
 When it presents a complete description of the child's nature and emphasizes its study
 gandhi ji kaa shiksha-darshan apane sthaapan main prakrutivaadee, apane uddeshy main adarshavaadi or kaary kii yojana tathaa paddati main prayojanavaadee he-- ek shiksha darshanik ke rup main gandhi ji kii mahatta is tathy main he ki unke darshan main prakrutivaadee, adarshavaadi evam prayojanavaadee pravritiyaan pruthak evam swatantra na hokar ek ho gayi hai or unka vikaas ek shiksha-siddhanth ke rup main hua he jo aaj kii aavashyaktaaon ke anukool hoga tathaa manushya kii aatma kii pavithratam aakankshaon ko santusht karegaa

 The term traction has been used here for two different deeds: one for the shallow and repeated weeding or hoofing that is done for the purpose of weeding and the deep plowing that occurs every year This is done so that grass roots and roots etc
 are buried under the ground
 tarkari or phool kii kheti main saadhaarant: jotai kii badi aavashyaktaa rahati he
 In most places in India, it is not desirable to grow grass on the ground in fruit gardens and therefore a little bit of weeding becomes necessary
 isamen koi andeh nahin ki godai yaa khurpiyane kaa pradhan uddeshy avaanchit ghaas paat kaa nirmulan he, isliye yah tabhi karnaa chahie jab ve chote hon or unhone apni jaden gahari na jamaa lee hon
 This traction should be shallow so that roots of flowers, flowers or fruits are not damaged

 At the same time, the fruit horticulture must be plowed at least in the summer and once in the rainy season with a plowing plow
 jotai kis samay kii jaae, yah bhi kuch mahatvapurn he
 If plowing is done on more wet land, it can definitely harm the land
 halki mitti kii apeksha baari mitti main aisi haani adhik hoti he
 In general, plowing is the only good thing that should be done on sufficiently dry land, but the land is not so dry that big chippings will start to crumble
 falon ke udyaan or tarkari ke kheton main bina jote hi vishesh rasinic padaarthon ke chhidkaav se ghaas paat maar daalana bhi upyogi siddh hua he
 If the distance between the plants is right, then a lot of land will be lying in the new fruit garden, which will not be useful for the fruit trees for years
 is bhoomi main sheeghra utpann honevaale fal, jaise papeeta, yaa koi tarkari paidaa kii ja sakati he
 Different types of plants require so many different amounts of water that no comprehensive rules can be made for them
 kitna pani diya jaae or kab diya jaae, yah is par nirbhar he ki koun-sa paudha he or ritu kya he
 It is necessary to water potted plants in the dry season every day
 sabhi padpon ke liye bhoomi ko nirantar nam rahanaa chahie jisase unki baadh na ruke
 Continuous watering is required for proper growth of fruits also
 yah samaran rakhana chahie ki bhoomi main nami maatra itani kam kabhi na ho ki paudhe murjhaa jaaen or phir punap na saken
 Good irrigation is the one in which the water is spoiled in minimum quantity
 yah kharabi kai kaarnon se ho sakati he : upree sataha par se pani ke bah jane se, anaavashyak gaharaai tak ghus jane se, upree sataha se bhaap banakar ud jane se tathaa ghaas-paat dwaara aavashyak pani khich jane se
 It is easy to irrigate the armpits of rows with rows of sidewalks

 The most important thing is to get proper diet of the plants
 fal or tarkari anya fasalon kii apeksha bhoomi se adhik maatra main aahaar grahan karte hai
 Fruiting trees and plants like Tarkari require many types of dietary components for their growth, which are usually present in sufficient quantities for their growth
 parantu koi avyav padap ko kitna mil sakegaa yah kai baton par nirbhar he, jaise vah avyav mitti main kis khanij ke rup main vidyaman he, mitti kaa kitna ansh kalil ke rup main he, mitti main adrrata kitni he or uski amlata kitni he
 Adding nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium to the soil has been found to be useful for most crops, as these elements are extracted in varying amounts by various crops
 isliye yah dekhnaa aavashyak he ki bhoomi ke in tatwon kaa santulan paudhon kii aavashyaktaa ke anusaar hi rahe
 Adding too much of one element can cause a decrease or imbalance in other elements, which can lead to a reduction in yield
 bhartiya bhoomi ke liye khaad ke sabase mahatvapurn ang nitrogen tathaa vanaspatik padaarth hai
 Remember that there is a difference between land and land; Therefore, there is no comprehensive recipe that can be used everywhere in this regard
 nitrogen denevaali kuch vastuen ye hai :- jeevajanik strot : gobar, lid, mutr, kooda karkat aadi kii khaad; khali tathaa hari fasalein jo khaad ke rup main kaam main aa sakati hai, jaise sanai, tinapatiyaa moong, dhencha aadi
 Non-biodegradable sources: Urea, which contains 40 percent nitrogen, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, calcium nitrate and sodium nitrate
 saadhaaran: bhoomi main prati acre 50 se 12 pound tak nitrogen santoshjanak hone kii aashaa kii ja sakati he
 It is possible that phosphorus will remain in sufficient quantity in the soil, but plants may only acquire slowly
 dekha gaya he ki kabhi-kabhi jahaan anya fasalein bahut hi nikammi hoti thim, vahaan falon kaa udyaan bhoomi main bina upar se fasphoras padaarth daale, bahut acchhee tarah phulataa faltaa he, sambhavat: isliye ki fal ke vrikshon ko fasphoras kii aavashyaktaa dhire-dhire hi padati he
 Phosphorus is present in fertilizers and all types of organisms
 parantu fasphorasprad vishesh vastuen ye hai-asthiyon kaa churna, basic slag or super phosphate jiskaa prayog bahutayat se hota he
 It contains 16 to 40 percent phosphorus pentaoxide
 un mittayon main, jo fasphoras ko sthir kar leti hai, pehali baar itnaa fasphorasmay padaarth daalana chahie ki sthir karne par bhi paudhon ke liye kuch fasphoras bachaa rahe, parantu jo mittyaan fasphoras ko sthir nahin karatin unamem adhik maatra main fasphorasmay padaarth nahin daalana chahie, anyathaa santulan bighad jayega or anya avyav kam pad jaayenge
 In a land where the amount of accessible potassium is very small, there is a visible difference in giving potassium, which is evident by the increase in yield
 potashium sulphate tathaa potacium chloride hi saadhaarant: khaad ke liye prayukt hote hai
 Each of these contains about 50 percent potassium oxide
 potacium nitrate main 44 pratishat potacium oxide hota he; saath main 13 pratishat nitrogen bhi rahata he
 Organic fertilizers may also contain 50 percent or more of potassium oxide
 polibhinil acetate ek carbonic yogic he
 Desalination refers to the many processes that extract salt and other minerals from water
 saadharantaya, lavan va khanijon ko hataane kii prakriya bhi vilwanikaran kehalaati he, jaise mrudaa vilwanikaran Desalination is done to convert salt water into fresh water so that it remains suitable for human consumption or irrigation
 Sometimes the salt eaten by this process is formed as a by-product
 iskaa prayog samudri jahaazon or pandubbiyon main kiya jaataa he
 In areas where fresh water availability is limited or is happening, nowadays the focus is on desalination to provide fresh water cheaply
 bade paimaane par diselination ke liye aam taur par adhik maatra main urja ke saath, vishesh buniyadi suvidhaon kii aavashyaktaa padati he, jisase isaki laagat nadiyon athwa bhoomi se praapt taaze jal kii tulana main atyadhik bad jaati he
 The world's largest desalination plant is the Jebel Ali plant in the United Arab Emirates
 yah ek dohare uddeshy vaali ikai he jo multi stage flash aswan kaa prayog karti he or prati varsh 300 million ghan meter pani kaa utpaadan karne main sakasham he
 In comparison, the largest desalination plant in the United States is in Tempa Bay, Florida, and operated by Tempa Bay Water, which began desalination of 34
7 million cubic meters of water per year in December 2007
 tempa be sanyantr, jebel ali diselination plant ke 12 % utpaadan par hi sanchalit ho rahaa he 17 janvari 2008 ko, wal street jarnal ke ek lekh main likhaa tha, "antarrashtriya diselination association ke anusaar, duniya bhar main 13,080 diselination sanyantr prati din 12 billian galen se adhik pani kaa utpaadan karte hai
 " in sanyantron main prayukt hone vaali paaramparik prakriya nirvaat aswan he - anivaary rup se kam vayumandaleey dabaav main pani ko ubaalte hai or is prakaar saamaanya se kahin kam taapmaana praapt hota he
 This is because the fluid boils only when the vapor pressure becomes equal to the surrounding pressure and the vapor pressure increases further with temperature
 is prakaar, kam taapmaana ke kaaran, urja kii bachat kii jaati he
 Multi-stage flash distillation, a leading distillation method, accounted for 85% of the world's total production in 2004
 diselination ke liye pramukh pratispardhi prakriyaayein, reverse osmosis prodyogiki dwaara membrane kaa prayog karti hai
 Membrane processes use semi-impermeable membrane and pressure to remove salt from water

 In places away from the sea, such as New Delhi, or in high places such as Mexico City, higher transportation rates will increase desalination costs
 Desalinated water is also expensive in those places which are away from the sea as well as at altitudes such as Riyadh and Harare
 In many places, the desalination process is more expensive than the transportation cost, so the process will be relatively inexpensive in coastal cities such as Beijing, Bangkok, Zaragoza, Phoenix, and, apparently, Tripoli

 In 1906, your first research paper on light diffraction was published in the Philosophical Journal of London
 uskaa sheershak tha - 'ytaakrit chhidr ke kaaran utpann aseemit vivartan pattiyaan'
 When rays of light pass through an aperture or on the edge of an opaque object and fall on a screen, stripes of sharp or colored light appear on the edge of the rays
 yah ghatana `vivartan' kehalaati he
 Diffraction is a common feature of motion

 bharat main darshanashastra ke dasha or disha ke adhyayan ko ham do bhaagon main vibhakt karke kar sakate hai - Colonial Indian philosophy has been mostly idealistic and suffragistic in its nature
 chunki veydant uskaa mul-strot tha, isliye us kaal kii darshanik punarrachanaon ko 'nav-vedanti' kaha ja saktaa he
 The philosophical tendency of this period can also be seen in response to the criticism of Western thinkers whom Albert Svitzer referred to in his book 'indian Thought and Its Development', saying that Indian philosophy is escapist
 vastutah sweetzar kaa yah drushtikon shoppenhavar jaise vichaarkon kii aupnishadik samaj par adhrith he
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan has given this strong answer in his work 'eastern Religion and Western Thought'
 unke anusaar yah dharna aitihaasik rup se sweekaarya nahin ho sakati ki hindoointan main jivan or jagat ke prati nakaar or niraashaa nihit he, jabaki isai chintan ke swaroop main jivan or jagat ke prati sweekaaryata or ashavad nihit he
 In fact, the real opposition between the two is about religion and the autonomous-humanist view
 1916 main aamalner, maharashtra main shrimant pratap seth ke saujany se indian institute of filosphi kii sthapana hui
 In 1917, the first session of the Indian Philosophical Association was held in Kolhapur and the publication of the magazine 'indian Philosophical Review' was also started
 1925 main indian filosfical congress kii sthapana hui
 It is an organization of philosophers who have been active in the development of Indian philosophical thought through English medium from the colonial era till now
 ye sabhi prayaas aupniveshik yug main bhartiya darshan ko sansthagat swaroop pradaan karne vaale sabit hue
 Shri Arvind, the leading thinker of pre-independence India, was basically a suffragist philosopher and, looking at the Vedic philosophy in an evolutionary format, presented an overall monotheistic philosophy in which both root and conscious have no parallel duality and are equal partners of the same global process
 
 anant ke tark or mayawad ke badale lilawad par aadhaarit unka darshan bhautikwaadiyon dwaara kiye jane vaale sanyas-nishedh or aadhyatmavaadiyon dwaara kiye jane vaale bhautikwaad-nishedh jaisi do atiyon se bachate hue is prithvi par divya jivan ke avataran kaa darshan he
 Through his philosophy, history philosophy, culture philosophy and yogic symposium, he has presented the perception of Indian civilization to the world with a cosmic purpose
 unhen apni darshanik yojana ke yatharth par kitna bharosa rahaa hoga ki unhone bharat kii swadhinata ko bhi ek vaishviya bhavitavyata kii angabhoot ghatana ke rup main dekha
 Apart from Sri Aurobindo, the name of Krishna Chandra Bhattacharya is notable among the prominent pre-independence Indian philosophers
 ve aadhunik bharat ke aise tatvamimasak the jinhone advaithavedant kii punarrachana ko kaant or higel kii vichaar-sarani ke samanaantar duniya ke samaksh rakhaa
 He presented his philosophical reconstruction through essays such as 'concept of Philosophy', 'subject as Freedom' and 'the Concept of Absolute and Its Alternative Farms'
 yadhyapi unhone bhartiya darshan ke lagbhag sabhi sampradaayon par lekhan kiya he lekin jain darshan ke anekaantwaad kii punarvyakhya li se hat kar vishesh mahatva kii he
 He reiterated the importance of polytheism, showing that neither identification nor opposition can be considered as the basis for logical thinking
 vastutah tadatmya or virodh donon hi paraspar viniyojaneey ho sakate hai or donon kii aisi viniyojaneeyata hi vyapak darshanik aadhaar prastut karti he
 Instead of identification and opposition, 'sahaavasthana' is a relatively more basic category of logical thought-array which is seen by Jain philosophers in two forms of 'order and surrender'
 kul mila kar anekantwaad anirvachyata kaa ek vishisht tarkshastra he jo saptabhangi nay ke dwaara satya kii vaikalpikta kaa siddhant prastut karata he
 In the context of India's renaissance, Bhattacharya's lecture titled 'swaraj in Ideas' is also important which he gave in 1929 among the students of Hooghly College, Calcutta
 baad main 1954 main iskaa prakaashan vishwabharati jarnal main hua
 His lecture in itself is like a philosophical manifesto of ideological swaraj
 1984 main pune se prakashit indian filosfical quarterli main unke is vyaakhyaan kaa punarmudran kiya gaya
 Daya Krishna, Rajendra Prasad, Ramchandra Gandhi, S
P
 People like Gautam commented on this lecture
 yadhyapi yah vyaakhyaan unhone angrezi main diya tha lekin vaicharik swaraj ke maatrubhaashiya rajpath ke mahatva or pashchimi vichaaron ke asamikshit pishtapeshan ke dushprinaamon ko unhone bakubi ujagar kiya
 Along with this, he also directed how Indian philosophy can be presented as a universal discipline
 vaicharik swaraj ke aashay ko spasht karte hue unhone kaha ki saanskrithik paradheenata saadharantah achetan prakaar kii hoti he or usamen daastaa prarambh se hi nihit he
 Bhattacharya says: swaraj kii bhartiya avadharana ke sandarbh main bharat ratna se vibhooshit bhagavaandas ke us aalekh kaa zikr karnaa praasangik he jise unhone 1921 ke bombay congress adhiveshan main ek prastaav-patr ke rup main prastut kiya tha
 Although there were differences among intellectuals in the form of Swaraj in those days and to overcome all these, he prepared this offer letter, but the discussion of this article of his is equal in the academic world
 bhagavaandas congress se jude ek bahumanya buddhijivi or thiosophical socity main sakriy the
 According to him, Swaraj is basically a moral suffix and in the sense of order it is self-rule
 jis prakaar ek vyakti main do tarah kii aatma-ek ucchtar or doosraa nimnatar-kaa nivas hota he arthath vyakti divine or pashavik donon hi pravritiyon se sanchalit hota he, usee prakaar kisi samaaj or raashtra kii bhi ucchtar or nimnatar aatma hoti he
 Any government or government can be considered good governance or self-government only when it is governed by a higher soul
 ucchtar aatma se abhiprerit raaj-kaaj or niti hi adhikadhik samanvayakaari ho sakati he
 Its democratic implementation and administration is possible only by the prudent-legislature who can coordinate i and us in every person
 pratispardhaa or paraspar sahyog donon hi aavashyak hai
 This insight of Bhagwandas is indicative of the moral ground of democratic swaraj

 The final work of his lifetime was 'bhagavad Gita as a Philosophy of God Realization'
 maranoparant unki sarvaadhik mahatvapurn kriti 'vedant : da kalmination of thot' sheershak se prakashit hui
 In this treatise he has proved the Brahmasutrakara Badarayana to be a co-ordinating philosopher, that the Vedic vision of 'swarajyam-vairajam' presents a higher ideal than Plato's 'philosophy-king theory'
 ‘swaarajyam-vairajyam’ kii avasthaa ko praapt vyakti hi vastav main devadhidev ananyaadhipati hota he

 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan had a reputation as a 'spokesman for the East and West' among Indian philosophers of the colonial era
 unhone maanav jivan ke sabhi pakshon kii vyakhya nav-vedantvaadi drushti se kii he
 He reinterpreted the philosophy of neo-vedanta in the perspective of theistic global philosophical thinking, that this visible world is an idea of the ultimate truth, but still not an illusion as Advaita has been assuming the traditional thinkers of Vedanta
 vastutah shankar ke mayawad kaa virodh or jagat kii yathatathyata kaa sweekaar aupniveshik yug ke nav-vedanti chintan kii prasthanamoolak visheshta rahi he
 Radhakrishnan has also made a significant contribution in the interpretation of the nature of religious experience and in the field of justification of religion
 purab or pashchim ke madhya darshanik samvaad kii aavashyaktaa ko auchitypurna tehraate hue unhone tulanaatmak darshan ko sadaiv badhaava diya, isiilie unhone hawaii vishvavidhyalay, america main east-west centre kii sthapana main pahalakaari bhoomika nibhaai
 In 'an Idealistic View of Life' he successfully propounded that wisdom cannot know the truth in its entirety
 antahpragna hi maanviya chetana kaa vah aayam he jahaan satya kaa apni sampoornataa main saakshaatkaar hota he
 This transcendental cognition proves religion, policy and omniscient monotheism
 buddhi keval vishleshan main hi vishrant ho jaati he lekin antahpragna apane sanshleshnatmak vyapaar main ek samgr bodh ke saath adarsh jivan kii sambhaavna prastut karti he
 Radhakrishnan has shown the concept of ideal life by applying it to Hindu life-vision
 apni ek duusari kriti 'da hindu vyuu of life' main unhone pashchim ke vipareet is bhartiya satya ko ujagar kiya ki bharat kii saanskrithik-dharmik chetana bahudevvaadi hote hue bhi advaitvaad kii virdohi nahin he
 Although the rational analytical philosophy of navya-vedanta begins with Krishna Chandra Bhattacharya in the colonial era, but the same tradition also comes to Rasbihari Das who pursued it in his own way
 kaant ke paramsat vishyak vishisht sanshaywad or whitehed ke chintan ke prabhaav main vedanti tatvamimasaa kii punarrachana ko unke darshanik chintan kaa sarvaadhik moulik paksh mana ja saktaa he
 His other works include 'the Essential of Advaitis', 'the Philosophy of Whitehead' and 'introduction to Shankar'
 das ke darshanik yogadan ko samajhane ke liye unke prakeern lekhanon kaa sangrah 'rasbihari das : filosfical esez' bahut hi upyogi he
 The name of Jiddu Krishnamurti is particularly notable among twentieth-century philosophers

 In 1950, the Philosophical Congress held its Silver Jubilee Session under the auspices of the Institute of Philosophy
 is avasar par ‘haiz shri arvind rigrauted mayawad?’ par hui mahatvapurn paricharchaa main us samay ke chaar murdhanya adhyetaon ne bhaag liya
 These were Indrasen, NA Nikam, Haridas Chaudhary and G
R
 Malkani
 bhartiya darshan ke bhavi vikaas kii drushti se is paricharchaa ko swatantrypurv bhartiya darshan kaa nichod or new testament jaisaa kaha ja saktaa he
 Indrasen showed in his presentation that in Vedas of Sri Aurobindo the Mayaism of the ancient Vedanta is automatically transformed into authoritarianism and in this way it is automatically contradicted in the philosophy of Sri Aurobindo
 arvind ne apane life divine main ek samgr or mart advait ko upasthaapit kiya he jisamen jad or chetana kaa ekanvayan ghatit hota he
 Based on the logic of Anant, he has proposed that in the development of superman, the unity of virtue and nirgun is attested by the plane of cognition itself
 mysore ke en
e nikam ne shankar ke vivartvaad or arvind ke aavirbhaavvaad main antar kiya
 He said that Arvind takes the meaning of Maya derived from metal in terms of measurement intersection and confusion or deception
 shri arvind ke anusaar vastutah mayawad main maaya shabd duusare arth arthath bhram yaa dhokhaa ke arth main prayukt hua he
 According to Nikam, the role of Moolavidya is the same in the philosophy of divine life of Arvind and in the Mayaism of Advaita Vedanta
 is tarah vastav main shri arvind main do prakaar ke tark kaa aisa dvaidhikaran he ki antatah unke darshan main mayawad anaavruth hi rah jaataa he
 Haridas Chaudhary acknowledges that the nature of the Supreme Being is such that it has a deep spiritual insight with a holiday for Mayism
 atah use antim rup se nirast nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The philosophy of Sri Aurobindo is actually the philosophy of ignorance of the transcendence of Mayavism
 tarksmmat advait vedant ke prabal samarthak ji
 aar
 malkani ne bebaak kaha ki shri arvind mayawad kaa khandan nahin karte hai
 According to him, in the unitary experience, the virtue and the nirguna cannot be coordinated
 swany shankar ke liye or malkani ke liye bhi satta ek or advait hi he
 The logic of the so-called infinite cannot abrogate the law of non-opposition
 vastutah mayawad hi advaitvaad ke sarvatha nirdwandv or susangat swaroop ko prastut karata he jahaan kisi bhi prakaar ke tatvamimasiy dwait ke liye koi avkaash hi nahin he
 This staunch opposition to Malkani is a reflection of Shankar's deep loyalty to monotheism
 'philaasphi of self' or 'metafisics of advait' jaisi kritiyon se unki yah nishtha pramanit bhi hoti he
 Thus, the condition and direction of philosophy in pre-independence India revolved around the philosophical thought called Navvedanta
 bhartiya navajagaran ke agradoot raja rammohan raay, dayanand saraswati, swami vivekanand, bal gangadhar tilak, shri aravind, rabindranath thakur or gandhi ityadi ke haathon vedant hi navvedant ke rup main punarsrujit hokar bhartiya navajagaran or swadhinata andolan ko vaicharik aadhaar pradaan karte hue ‘bhartiya swaraj’ kaa darshan ban kar pratishthit hua
 Academic philosophers of that period made the departure of their Navvedanti philosophy a denial of the Mayanist attitude towards life and the world, acceptance of the preciseness of the world, and Vedanti making a greater leisure for progressive and creative life in the world view
 saath hi saath is kaal ke navvedanti chintan main un saamaajik-saanskrithik vikaron ke prati bhi ek shashakt atmachetana dikhaayi padi jinhen paramparaagat vedant kii adwaiti vishwa-drushti se kadaapi sangat nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 In this way, in pre-independence neo-philosophical thinking, not only the philosophical restructuring of traditional Vedanta, but also an ideological movement to eradicate the latent disorders in Indian culture and society was created
 bhartiya darshan kaa aupniveshik yug kis tarah swatantryottar yug main roopantarit hota he or naye yug main vah kya swaroop grahan karata he, isaki ek jhalak hamen 'contempareri filosphi' naamak granth ke duusare parivarddhit sanskaran main dekhne ko milti he

 home rule aandolan akhil bhartiya home rule lig, ek rashtriya raajnneetik sanghathan tha jisaki sthapana 1916 main bal gangadhar tilak dwaara bharat main swashaasan ke liye rashtriya maang kaa netritv karne ke liye "home rule" ke naam ke saath kii gai thi
 This was done to ensure India attained the status of a Dominion under the British Raj
 us samay british samrajya ke bheetar australia, canada, dakshin africa, newjiland or newfoundland dominian ke rup main sthapit the
 At the start of the First World War, moderates from the Indian National Congress decided to help Britain
 bhartiya rashtriya congress ke is nirnay ke peeche sambhawatah ye kaaran tha ki yadi bharat britain kii sahaayta karegaa to yuddh ke pashchaat britain bharat ko swatantra kar degaa
 But soon the Indian National Congress got the impression that Britain would never do such a thing and hence the Indian leaders became dissatisfied and started looking for another route
 yahi asantushtataa hi home rule aandolan ke janm kaa kaaran bani
 Two Home Rule Leagues were established between 1915 and 1916
 'pune home rule lig' kii sthapana bal gangadhar tilak ne or 'madras home rule lig' kii sthapana ani besent ne kii
 The Home Rule League became a subsidiary of the Indian National Congress
 is aandolan kaa uddeshy swa-rajya kii prapti tha parantu is aandolan main shastron ke prayog kii anumati nahin thi
 Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Annie Besant erected a flag in 1917 during the Home Rule Movement
 is dhvaj par paanch laal or chaar hari tirakshi pattiyaan baniin thi
 Seven stars were also inscribed on it, but this flag did not become very famous among the people
 1920 main, akhil bhartiya home rule lig ne mahatma gandhi ko iske adhyaksh ke rup main nirvaachit kiya
 In one year, this organization merged into the Indian National Congress for a united Indian political front and ended its own existence
 shrimati eni bessent ireland kii rahanevaali thi
 She was the head of the Theosophical Society in India

 is samay ireland main yris netaa redmand ke netritv main homerul lig kii sthapana hui thi jo vaidhanik tathaa shantimay upayon se ireland ke liye homerul tathaa swashaasan praapt karnaa chaahati thi
 When Anne Besant went to England in 1913, the Homerule League of Ireland suggested to her that the Homerul movement should be started to make India independent
 shrimati eni bessent bharat ko usee tarah kaa swaraj dilaanaa chaahati thi, jaisaa ki british samrajya ke duusare upniveshon main tha arthath bharat ko adhirajya sthiti dilaane kii icchhuk thi
 On returning to India for this purpose, he joined the Congress and organized the Homerul movement by uniting liberals and extremists
 homerul aandolan ek vaidhanik aandolan tha
 The main objectives of this movement were: bal gangadhar tilak chah varsh kii lambi sajaa kaatane ke baad 16 june 1914 ko jail se chute
 Most of the time of captivity was spent in Mandalay

 The Indian National Congress was yet to recover from the combined shock of the moderate nationalists' disappointment due to the partition of Surat, the oppressive attacks of the British on the agitators, and the constitutional reforms of 1909
 tilak ne sochaa ki sabase pehle to congress hokar baaki garampanthiyon ko bhi isamen shaamil karavaaya jaae
 Tilak was convinced that the Indian National Congress has become synonymous with the Indian National Movement and no national movement can succeed without its permission
 narampanthiyon ko samajhane-bujhane, unka vishwaas jeetne tathaa bhavishya main angreji hukumat daman kaa rasta na akhriyaar kare, is uddeshy se usne ghoshnaa kii ‘‘main saaf-saaf kahata hoon ki ham log hindustan main prashasan vyavastha kaa sudhaar chaahate hai jaisaa ki ireland main vahaan ke aandolankaaree maang kar rahe hai
 We have no intention of overthrowing the British rule
 is baat ko kehane main mujhe koi hichak nahin ki bharat ke vibhinn bhaagon main jo hinsaatmak ghatnaayen hui hai, na keval meri vichaardhaara ke vipareet he, balki unke kaaran hamaare raajnneetik vikaas kii prakriya bhi dhimi hui he
 He reiterated his loyalty to the British rule and appealed to the Indian public to support the British rule in times of crisis
 narampanthi kheme ke tamaam netaa ab mahasoos karne lage the ki 1907 main surat main jo kuch unhone kiya, vah galat tha
 They were also upset with the stagnation of the Congress
 inhen tilak kii apil bahut bhaayi
 Apart from this, he was under constant pressure from Anne Besant to revive the nationalist political movement in the country
 eni bessent abhi haal hi main congress main shaamil hui thi
 In 1914, she was 66 years old, her political career began in England where she participated in the promotion of freedom thinking, radical reformism, Fabianism and theology
 1893 main ve bharat ai, uddeshy tha thiosaphical socity ke liye kaam karnaa
 He opened his office in Adiyar, a suburb of Madras and in 1907 started promoting Theosophy
 thode samay main hi unhone samarthakon kii ek badi sankhya kar lee
 Including mostly educated individuals from communities that had not yet had a cultural renaissance
 1914 main eni bessent ne apni gatividhiyon kaa dayera badhaane kaa nirnay kiya or ireland kii homerul lig kii tarah bharat main bhi swashaasan kii maang ko lekar aandolan chalaane kii yojana banaai
 They felt that for this it was necessary to seek the permission of the Congress and the cooperation of the extremist agitators
 garampanthiyon kaa sahyog paane ke liye unhen congress main shaamil karnaa jaruri tha
 Anne Besant understood the radical leaders of the Congress to allow Tilak and his extremist allies to join the Congress
 lekin 1914 ke congress adhiveshan ne uski koshishon par pani pher diya
 Ferozeshah Mehta and his moderate supporters of Bombay convinced Gokhale and Bengal moderates to keep the extremists out
 iske baad tilak or eni bessent khud apane boote par raajnneetik aandolan chalaane kaa faisla kiya or saath-hi-saath ve congress par dabaav bhi daalati rahi ki garampanthiyon ko punah apana sadsy bana le
 In early 1915, Anne Besant started the movement through two newspapers 'new India' and 'kaman Veil'
 jansabhaayen tathaa sammelan yojit kiye
 Their demand was that in the way the white people were given the right to form their own government in the white colonies, the people of India should also get the right to self-government
 april 1915 ke baad eni bessent ne or bhi kadaa or jujharu rukh akhriyaar kiya
 Meanwhile, Lokmanya Tilak started his political activities
 lekin ve kaaphi satark the ki congress kaa narampanthi khemaa naaraaz na ho yaa congress ko yah na lage ki tilak kii gatividhiyaan congress kii niti se mail nahin khaati
 His heartfelt desire was to join the Congress in some way
 tilak ne 1915 main puna main apane samarthakon kaa ek sammelan bulaayaa, jisamen yah faisla kiya ki gramin janata ko congress ke uddeshyon or uski gatividhiyon se parichit karaane ke liye ek santhaan kaa gathan kiya jaae
 After this decision, in August and September of the same year, the local organizations formed in different cities of Maharashtra, instead of intensifying political activities, spent all the energy to establish unity in the Congress
 ve baraabar jor dete rahe ki kisi bhi rashtriya aandolan ke liye congress main ekta bahut jaruri he
 Tilak sometimes resorted to intimidation to pressure some moderate Congress conservatives, but was confident that he would convince most moderate leaders to be persuaded
 disambar 1915 main congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan hua or tilak tathaa eni bessent ke prayaason ko safalataa mili
 It was decided to withdraw the extremists into the Congress
 firozshah mehta ke nidhan ke baad bombay ke narampanthiyon kaa virodh beasar sabit hua
 Gokhale had passed away
 garampanthiyon ko congress main laane main to eni bessent safal rahi par homerul lig ke gathan ke apane prastaav par congress or muslim lig kii manjuuri nahin le saki
 But his proposals for campaigning to revive Congress committees at the local level were accepted by the Congress but he knew the character and strength of the Congress of that time
 ve jaanati thi ki congress ne in kaaryakramon ko manjuuri to de di he, lekin vah is par amal nahin karegi
 Therefore, he had also laid down the condition with his proposal that if the Congress does not implement these programs by September 1916, then it will form its own organization
 tilak ko kagrence main waapas aane kaa adhikaar mil gaya tha or unhonen kagrence se kisi tarah kaa vaada bhi nahin kiya tha, isliye unhonen april 1916 main belgaum main hue prantiya sammelan main ‘homerul lig’ ke gathan kii ghoshnaa kii
