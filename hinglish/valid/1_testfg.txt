 The measurement of the ionizing potential of an X-ray is called the unveiling: haalanki padaarth par insheel vikiran kaa prabhaav utpann aavesh kii apeksha unamem jamaa urja kii maatra se bahut kareeb se sambandhit hota he
 The measure of this absorbed energy is called the absorbed quantity: samatuly maatra, maanav utak par vikiran ke jaivik prabhaav kii maap he
 As for X-rays, it is equal to the absorbed volume

 One increasingly common method is the use of photostimulated luminescence), which was introduced by Fuji in the 1980s
 aadhunik aspataalon main photographic plate kii jagah photostimulabl fosfar plate kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 After X-rays flow over the plate, the excited electrons of the phosphor material remain "trapped" in the "color centers" of the crystal lattice until they are excited by a laser beam passing through the plate surface
 During laser excitation, the free light is collected by a photomultiplier tube and the resulting signal is converted into a digital image by computer technology, which gives the process its common name, computerized radiography
 PSP plates can be reused, and do not require any modification to existing X-ray equipment to use them

 For many applications, counters are not sealed but are constantly filled with pure gas, thus reducing contamination or gas decay problems
 inhen "pravaah counter" kaha jaataa he
 Some substances, such as sodium iodide, can "transform" an X-ray photon into a visible photon; An electronic detector can be constructed by adding a photomultiplier
 in detectaron ko "cintilator", filmuscreen yaa "cintilation counter" kehete hai
 The main advantage of using them is that an adequate picture can be obtained even when a very small amount of X-rays are passed on the patient

 Those who know the mysteries of mind science accept that, like exercise, study, art, practice, cultivation is also a capable process, which is fully capable of exposing and enhancing many mysterious abilities of the consciousness field
 saraswati upasna ke sambandh main bhi yahi baat he
 If it is done with the classical method, then it is not less, more successful in developing intellectual ability than other mental remedies
 mandabuddhi logon ke liye gayatri mahashakti kaa saraswati tatva adhik hitkar sidgh hota he
 Saraswati cultivation has special utility for developing intellectual capacity, eliminating the agility and malaise of the mind

 The electrical capacitance of a driver is the measure of the ability of the conductor to collect electrical charge
 jab kisi chaalak ko aavesh diya jaataa he to uskaa vaidyut vibhav aavesh ke anupaat main badhata jaataa he
 If a driver has a v increase in its potential when q is charged, then jahaan c ek niyatank he jiskaa maan chaalak ke aakaar, sameepvarti madhyam tathaa paas main anya chaalkon kii upasthiti par nirbhar karata he
 This constant is called 'electrical capacitance'
 upar ke sameekaran q = CV se Thus, the electrical capacitance of a conductor is the ratio of charge given to the conductor and the increase in the potential of the conductor
 dharita kaa SI maatrak kulam / volt he
 It is called 'ferred' and denotes it with F
 is prakaar, The unit in the capacitance emu is 4 state ferred
 isi prakaar C=q / v se- If v = 1 volt, c = q then the electrical capacitance of a conductor is the amount of charge given to the conductor which changes the voltage of the conductor by one volt
 vaidhut dharita ek adish raashi he
 The value of valid holdings is always positive
 kyoki chaalak par aavesh tathaa iske kaaran vibhav main parivartan ke chinh saamaan hote hai
 The dimensional formula of capacity is - chaalak ke madhyam kaa paravaidyuthank badhane se dharita bhi babbti he
 The holding of a driver does not depend on the following facts: note - yadi sutara c=q / v se v=0 to c=∞ atah dharita anant hogi
 Since the potential of the Earth is 0
 to prithvi kii dharita anant hogi
 Therefore, the earth can store eternal charge
 isi prakaar jab ham kisi chaalak ko aavesh dete he to chaalak ke vibhav kaa aankik maan badhata he
 If the charge is continuously given to the driver, then the driver does not accumulate static energy, that is, the valid insulation capacity is lost
 tathaa aavesh li hone lagata he
 In this case the value of potential is maximum
 ore is prakaar chaalak dwaara aavesh kii ek nishchit maatra kaa sangrah hi sambhav he
 An indirect example of this is that when we put an empty vessel in water, the water in the vessel rises only to a certain amount and the water then starts coming out of the vessel
 ise bartan kii dharita kehete he
 It is expressed in milliliters, liters etc
 jab kisi chaalak ko aavesh diya jaataa he to vah vibhajit rup main diya jaataa he
 Hence, due to the pre-accumulated charge on the conductor, the external repulsion is acted upon against the legitimate repulsion force
 yahi kaary chaalak main vaidhut sthatij urja ke rup main sanchit ho jaataa he
 Which is called the static energy of the conductor
 mana chaalak kii dharita c he prarambh main chaalak par aaveshairi tathaa vibhavaji shunya he
 The charge is given in divided form to the conductor, which also increases the value of potential
 aavesh q dene ke saath va v kaa maan bhi badhata he atah ausat vibhav- By the definition of the potential voltage, the work done with the voltage change when the charge q is given chunki kaary hi chaalak main sthatij urja ke rup main sanchit he to- Putting the values of q and v in the equation from c = q / v- note- prashn-kiya gaya kaary sthatij urja ke rup main kyon sanchit hota he
 How is work related to energy? uttar-kaary karne kii kshamta ko urja kehete he
 And the unit of work and energy is also 4 joules
 yah tatv ganit dwaara pramanit kiya ja saktaa he ki kisi yantra main jitani urja daali jaye utane hi pariman main hamen kaary praapt hota he usase adhik nahin
 This is the law of power
 atah ab yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki kisi bhi kiye kaary dwaara ham kisi yantra main urja utane hi pariman main sanchit kar sakate he
 This can be proved in the modern form by the work-energy theorem
 kisi spring ko sampidit karte samay jo kaary karnaa padhta he vahi kaary us spring main sanchit urja he
 Which is called potential energy
 atah urja kisi kaary dwaara hi janm leti he
 And any work is possible by any energy
 vishesh-1 chaalak ko dhanavesh diya jaye yaa rinavesh, vaidhut sthatij urja sadaiv dhanatmak hoti he
 2 If for two drivers holding c and c - atah adhik dharita ke chaalak kii vaidhut sthatij urja adhik hogi
 Hence the valid position energy of the conductor of lower capacitance will be higher

 In mathematics and computer science, hexadecimal is a positional numeral system that has a radix or base value of 16
 isamen solah alag-alag pratikon kaa istemaal hota he jisamen 0 se 9 tak ke pratik shunya se nau tak ke maanon ko pradarshit karte hai or A, B, C, D, E, f tak ke pratik das se pandrah tak ke maanon ko pradarshit karte hai
 For example, the value of the hexadecimal number 2AF3 is equal to + + + or 10,995 in the decimal number system

 For example, the value of byte can range from 0 to 255 but its values can be more conveniently represented as two hexadecimal digits from 00 to FF
 hexadesimal kaa istemaal aam taur par computer memory adreson ko darshane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 Template: Hexadecimal table In situations where reference is lacking, a hexadecimal number with numbers expressed in other root digits can be ambiguous and misleading
 spasht rup se maanon ko vyakt karne kii kai paddatiyaan prachlit hai
 a numerical subscript can express the root numeral clearly: 15910 is decimal 159; 15916 is hexadecimal 159, which equals 34510
 anya lekhak ek paath sabscript, jaise - 159dashamalav or 159hex, yaa 159d or 159h, kaa istemaal karnaa pasand karte hai
 Linear text systems, such as the systems used in most computer programming environments, have introduced a variety of methods: main upsarg ke rup main # x or # 16r kaa istemaal hota he
 There is no universal tradition of using lowercase or uppercase for letter numerals and each prevails or is preferred in particular environments through community standards or tradition

 hexadesimal pranali main rinatmak sankhyaon ko dashamalav pranali kii tarah hi vyakt kiya ja saktaa he: -42 ko pradarshit karne ke liye –2A or isi tarah anya
 However, some people instead prefer to express the exact bit pattern used in the processor and consider hexadecimal values to be best handled as indicated values only
 is tarah, rinatmak sankhya -42 ko ek 32-bit sipiu register main xxrep 4 f FFD6 ke rup main likhaa ja saktaa he jis prakaar ek 32-bit epapiyu register main C228 xxrep 4 0 ke rup main, yaa ek 64-bit epapiyu register main C045 xxrep 4 0 xxrep 4 0 xxrep 4 0 ke rup main likhaa ja saktaa he 
 Most computers manipulate binary data, but it is difficult for humans to work with countless digits even for a relatively small binary number
 yadhyapi adhikansh insaan aadharank 10 system se parichit he, lekin phir bhi dashamalav kii tulana main hexadesimal main binary kaa naksha bananaa kaaphi aasaan he

 isaki tulana hexadesimal main kiye gaye roopantaran se karen, jahaan chaar ankon vaale prayek samooh par swatantraapurvak vichaar kiya ja saktaa he or pratyaksh rup se roopantarit kiya ja saktaa he: The conversion from hexadecimal to binary is equally direct
 octal pranali ko binary computer data kaa pratyaksh saamana karne vaale logon ke liye ek saadhan ke rup main bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Octal represents data as three bits per character instead of four

 However, to work seriously with data, it may be advisable to work with bitwise operators to a large extent
 strot aadharank main prayek sthaan ko iske sthaan maan kaa hexadesimal pradarshan pradaan karke or uske baad antim pradarshan praapt karne ke liye jod or guna karke bhi roopantaran kaary kiya ja saktaa he
 That is, to convert a B3AD number to a decimal number one can divide this conversion into D, A, 3 and b and then multiply each decimal display by 16p to get the final result, where 'p' Right to left is a favorable position that starts at 0
 is sthiti main hamen 13* + 10* + 3* + 11* praapt hota he jo dashamalav pranali main 45997 ke baraabar he
 Most modern computer systems with a graphical user interface provide a built-in calculator utility that has the ability to perform conversions between different radixes, typically including hexadecimal
 microsoft windos main, calculator utility ko vaigyanik calculator mod main set kiya ja saktaa he, jo mulank 16, 10, 8 or 2 ke bich roopantaran kii anumati detaa he; sabase zyada aam taur par programmeron dwaara prayukt aadharank
 vaigyanik mod main, on-screen sankhyatmak keepad main a se lekar f tak hexadesimal ank shaamil hote hai jo "hex" kaa chayan karne par sakriy ho jate hai
 In hex mode, however, the Windows calculator only supports integers
 jaisaa ki anya sankhyatmak pranaaliyon ke saath hota he, hexadesimal pranali kaa istemaal parimey sankhyaon ko pradarshit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, haalanki aavarti ank aam hote hai kyonki solah main keval ek ekal abhajya gunankhand hota he: Where an overline indicates a recurring pattern
 kisi bhi aadharank ke liye, 0
1 hameshaa uske baraabar hota he jo apni khud kii sankhya pranali main us aadharank maan ke pradarshan se vibhajit hota he: aadharank 3 kii ginati 0, 1, 2, 10 he
 Thus, whether one is divided by two for binary or one for hexadecimal is divided by sixteen, both of these factors are written as 0
1
 chunki mulank 16, ek purna varg he, isliye hexadesimal main vyakt gunan khand kii visham avadhi, aksar dashamalav main vyakt gunan khandon se kahin adhik hoti he or koi chakree sankhya nahin hoti he
 Recurring digits are displayed when the denominator of the lowest terms has a prime factorization not found in the radix; Thus, when using hexadecimal notation, all multiplication clauses with a denominator that are not powers of two are converted into an infinite string of recurring digits
 yah tarksangat sankhyaon ko pradarshit karne ke liye hexadesimal ko dashamalav kii tulana main kam suvidhajanak banaata he kyonki ek bahut bada bhaag parimit pradarshan kii seemaa ke baahar hi rah jaataa he
 All rational numbers that are finitely displayed in hexadecimal are also finitely representable in decimal, duodecimal, and hexadecimal: that is, any hexadecimal number with a finite number of digits has a finite number of digits when it is assigned to those other values
 Is expressed in iske vipareet, keval baad vaale mulaankon main parimit taur par pradarshneey hone vaala ek gunan khand, hexadesimal main parimit taur par pradarshneey hota he
 For example, an infinite recurring display in decimal 0
1 hexadecimal matches 0
1 xxrep 11 9 xxrep 4 
 haalanki, hexadesimal, har main do ke ghaat ke saath gunan khandon ko pradarshit karne ke liye 12 or 60 mulaankon se adhik kushal hota he 
 Perhaps it is easier to show the most widely used power, the power of two, using base 16
 do ke pehle solah ghaaton ko neeche dikhaaya gaya he
 Since the square of four is sixteen, the power of four has a simple relation: do or chaar kaa istemaal karte samay yah tetration ko or zyada aasaan bhi bana detaa he
 32 = 24 = 10 hex, 42 = 216 = 1 xxrep 4 0 hex and 52 = 265536 = hex
 hexadesimal shabd heksa- or -decimal shabdon se milakar bana he jisamen se heksa- shabd ko unani shabd έξ se liya gaya he jiskaa istemaal "chah" ke liye kiya jaataa he or -decimal shabd "dasvaan" ke liye istemaal hone vaale latin shabd se liya gaya he

 hexadesimal kaa istemaal kabhi-kabhi programmer joke main kiya jaataa he kyonki kuch shabdon kaa nirmaan keval hexadesimal ankon kaa istemaal karke hi kiya ja saktaa he
 Some of these words are "dead", "beef", "babe" and "coffee" with appropriate substitutions
 chunki inhen programmer turant pahchaan sakate hai, isliye dibging seoup kabhi-kabhi programmeron ke liye memory ko chaalu karte hai taaki programmeron ko yah dekhne main madad mil sake ki kab koi kaam chaalu nahin hua he
 Some people place an h after the number if they want to show that it is written in hexadecimal
 puraane intel asembli sintex main, aisa kabhi-kabhi hoga he
 An example of this is "CAFEBABE", a magic number of Universal mac-o files and a Java class file structure
 ekal-avasanrachana 32-bit bade-ant vaale maa-o filon ke shuru main jaadui sankhya "FEEDFACE" hoti he

 The history of Malayalam literature is primarily the history of poetry till the last phase of the 19th century

 Its coastal countries are Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Russia, Azerbaijan, Iran
 iskaa uttari bhaag bahut chhichhlaa he jahaan isaki gaharaai 5- 6 meter he, jabaki dakshini bhaag kii ausat gaharaai 1000 meter ke aasapaas he
 The Caspian Sea is also called Qazvin in ancient maps
 iske alaava ise iran main darya-e-maazndraan bhi kehete hai
 Like the Black Sea, it is also a remnant of the historic and extinct Para Tithys Sea, which had become land-locked due to the movements of tectonic layers of the earth about 5
5 million years ago

 In this poem, a fictional controversy of lassi and tea, both popular in North India and Pakistan, is depicted satirically
 kavita ke armbh main lassi apni swayan badhaai karti he or chaay ko bura-bhala kahati he - Color is my v butter class, Roop v is my sweet, Milk-milk mother-in-law, my status is high! i am sitting here, i am very happy, i am a goddess, i am a witch! Get a cold heart meraa rang bhi makkhan jaisaa gora he or meraa rup bhi sachcha he,doodh or malai mere maan-baap hai, meraa darza tujhse ooncha he!jo mujhe manthane baithta he, main uske nyochhavar jaati hoon,madhaani dhol kii tarah khadkati he or mai bartan main gol-gol naachati hoon!mai logon kii sehat banaati hoon or tu unki sehat bigaadti he,mai logon kaa kalejaa thanda karti hoon or tu unka seenaa jalaati he! Here Lassi is saying that when someone churns her in a big pot with Madhani, she falls on it - that is, her splashes happily fall on the churner
 chaay gusse se uttar detii he or apni tulana laila se karti he, jo rang kii kaali thi par behad sundar maani jaati thi or jiskaa majanu divaana tha
 She also taunts Lassi that Lassi is still lying in any vessel, while tea is always placed on the table in a beautiful pot with adornment - meraa husan pchhaane jehde, dil main onade thagganmera rang kalikkhan utte laila vargi laggankajji rao tu kujje andar, tainu kii taqalifaan?je mai sohane mezaan utte rakkhaan pai tasharifaan My beauties are convinced that my color is black and i keep the appearance of Laila, hiding in my pot, why do you feel jealous when i look at beautiful tables? in donon kii tu-tu main-main kaaphi der tak chalati rahati he or phir lassi kahati he kii kyon na doodh ko bulaakar us se faisalaa karavaaya jaae - i am going to make tears, i am not going to do justice mai na to teri kisi gun se parichit hoon or na hi tujhstogar doodh hamaari ladaai kaa faisalaa kare to mujhe manzur he But when milk comes, he gets confused because milk pours in both lassi and tea and he considers both of them as his daughters
 doodh apane aap ko kosta he, ki agar wo swayan acha mata / pita hota to uske bachche aapas main na lard rahe hote or faisalaa karne se inkaar kar detaa he - Kinnu ajj siyani akkhan, kinnu akkhan jalli? Dwaan passe rishta mera, minu khich dowllisaggi jahi matarai hundi, chang hon ja ma-pamera vote ai dowan valle, tackle la tusi aap kise aaj ciyaani boluun or kise aaj murkh kahoon?meraa to donon se hi rishta he, jo mujhe donon taraf khinchataa hedgar mata-pita achche hon, to bachche aapas main sagi or gahari mitrataa rakhte hanmera vot to tum donon ko hi jaataa he, aapas main hi nipataara karo The debate then continues
 ant main lassi chaay ko do took shabdon main kah detii he ke yah desh lassi kaa he or wo yahan kii rani he jabaki chaay paradesi he or thik jis tarah paradesi angrezon ko khaded ke nikaal diya gaya tha, usee tarah ek din chaay ko bhi khaded diya jayega - Mary Chaudhar char-chafer, Thy Manata Thoda i Desan Di sub-rani The camp meri choudhary chaaron taraf he, teri manyata mujhase kahin kam hemai is desh kii rani hoon, tu ek maamuli si paradesan chhokari heis paraaye desh main aakar tu apane aap ko is ghar kii saali bataane lagi?aag maangane ke bahaane ghar main ghusi thi, ab khud ko gharwaali bataane lagi?bhagwaan kare ki tera koi pakkaa bandobast kar dongrezon kii tarah tuje bhi is desh se ukhaad baahar phenk diya jaae Athipothala is a waterfall on the Chandravanka River, a tributary of the Krishna River, in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh state, India

 tufaan fanopi jise philippines main tufaan inde ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, ek bahut nuksaan karne vaala tufaan tha
 It arrived in Taiwan and Southeast China in September 2010
 yah us varsh kaa gyarahavaan ushnkaribandheey tufaan or us ritu kaa chauthaa tufaan tha
 It began to form in the Philippines on 14 September and after that it slowly moved forward over several days
 yah jab uttar purv se uttar main jane laga tha, tab isaki gati 175 kilometre prati ghante thi
 Due to this, for the first time, rain fell on September 19 in Huaylen city of Taiwan
 agast 2009 ke baad yah pehla tufaan tha, jo is dweep se takaraayaa tha
 Then it finally ended in South China on 21 September after raining in the city of Fujian, China
 taiwan or china main iske prabhaav se purv pehla prabhaav dakshin japan main bhi padaa tha
 Due to which Miyako Island also received rainfall
 lekin yah china or taiwan ke muqaabale bahut kam tha
 Funapi caused heavy rainfall in Taiwan and crossed 1,126 millimeters
 1,50,000 logon ko unke gharon se hataaya gaya
 After witnessing the devastating effects of Hurricane Morakot last year, several preparations were made this year
 phir bhi baari barish ke kaaran bhuskhalan, atyadhik maatra main fasal barbaad hue or kai jagah baadh bhi aayaa
 It had the most impact in the city of Kohsiung
 jahaan 506 millimetre barish darj kii gai thi
 Due to this there was a loss of about one hundred crore rupees
 tufaan ke jate samay taiwan main kul paanch log mar gaye or nuksaan kareeb pachaas karod kaa hua tha
 After this, about 2,64,000 people were safely evacuated from their homes in South China
 is jagah main tufaan ne bahut adhik barish karavaaya
 It reached 640 millimeters in Guiyangdong
 fanopi ke kaaran yahan bhuskhalan bhi hua, jiske kaaran 75 logon kii maut ho gai
 Here, sixteen thousand houses were destroyed due to this storm and one and a half lakh acres of crops were also completely destroyed
 is praant main lagbhag pachaas karod kaa nuksaan hua
 The name was released after doing much damage to it
 bhashavigyaan bhashaa ke adhyayan kii vah shakha he jisamen bhashaa kii utpatti, swaroop, vikaas aadi kaa vaigyanik evam vishleshnatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Linguistics scholars are called 'philologists'
 bhashavigyaan, vyakaran se bhinn he
 Functional study of a language is done in grammar while the linguist goes on to do a very comprehensive study of the language
 adhyayan ke anek vishyon main se aajkal bhashaa-vigyaan ko vishesh mahatva diya ja rahaa he
 This language-related study has been named in Europe with many names and nouns till date
 sarvapratham is adhyayan ko philology shabd ke aage visheshan ke rup main ek shabd joda gaya- tab ise ‘‘comparative philology’’ kah kar pukaara gaya
 Until the nineteenth century, grammar and linguistic studies were often considered to be the same
 atah ise vidwaanon ne 'comparative grammer' naam bhi diya
 In France it was named Langistić
 france main bhashaa sambandhi kaary adhik hone ke kaaran unnisvin sadi main sampoorn europe main hi "linguistique" athwa "linguistics" naam hi prachlit rahaa he
 Apart from this, other names like 'science of Language', 'glutology' etc
 also came in handy to reveal this subject
 aaj in sabhi naamon main se ‘‘linguisticks’’, ‘‘philology’’ maatr hi prayog main laae jate hai
 In addition to all these European names in India, the names which are used in Hindi language are as follows - "bhasha-shastra", "bhasha-tattva", "bhasha-sasti", and "" Comparative linguistics "etc
 in sabhi naamon main se sarv prachlit naam ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’ he
 All the names, ancient and new, appear to be synonymous in these names
 atah yahi naam is shaastra ke liye sarvatha upyukt prathit hota he
 In its present form, linguistics is said to be the brain of Western scholars
 ati pracheen kaal se hi bhashaa-sambandhi adhyayan kii pravriti sanskrit-sahitya main pai jaati he
 a subtle discussion on language is available in Vedang called 'shiksha'
 dhvaniyon ke uccharan- avyav, sthaan, praytn aadi kaa in granthon main vistrut varnan uplabdh he
 Scientific analysis can be called scientific study of the language on the subjects' etymology, metal, prefix-suffixes etc
 in 'pratishyakhya' and Nirukta
 bhartruhari ke granth ‘vaakya padiya’ ke antargat ‘shabd’ ke swaroop kaa sookshm, gahan evam vyapak chintan uplabdh hota he
 There the word is envisaged as 'brahman' and its 'letter' is described as a noun
 prakaaraantar se yah ek bhashaa-adhyayan sambandhi granth hi he
 In Sanskrit literature, even in philosophical and literary texts, we get indications of language scientific discussions only under the subtle interpretation of the words' meaning ',' rasa ',' bhava ',' language available here and there in Sanskrit literature
 -conceptual material can certainly be called the cornerstone of current linguistics
 aadhunik vishay ke rup main bhashaa-vigyaan kaa sutarapaat europe main san 1786 i0 main sar wiliam jones naamak vidwaan dwaara kiya gaya mana jaataa he
 In the context of the study of Sanskrit language, Sir William Jones had first done a comparative study of Sanskrit, Greek and Latin language and expressed the possibility that at least one of the languages forms the basis of these three languages
 atah in teenon bhashaaon ke bich ek sookshm sambandh sutara avashya vidyaman he
 This type of comparative study of languages became the first step in the field of modern linguistics
 ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’ naam main do padon kaa prayog hua he
 "language" and "science"
 bhashaa-vigyaan ko samajhane se purv in donon shabdon se parichit hona aavashyak prathit hota he
 The word 'bhasha' is derived from the Sanskrit "bhash" metal
 jiskaa arth he-vyakt vaak 
 The word 'science' is formed by applying the prefix 'v' and 'lute' from the 'known' metal
 saamaanya rup se ‘bhashaa’ kaa arth he ‘bol chaal kii bhashaa yaa boli’ tathaa ‘vigyaan’ kaa arth he ‘vishesh gyaan’, kintu ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ shabd main prayukt in donon padon kaa spasht or vyapak arth samaj lene par hi ham is naam kii sargarbhitako jaanane main safal honge
 So, here we try to explain the broad meaning of both these terms
 bhashahmanav ek saamaajik praani he
 The need to convey our feelings and thoughts to each other in the society has been felt since time immemorial
 is prakaar bhashaa kaa astitva maanav samaaj main ati pracheen siddh hota he
 Language serves as an important tool for publishing the entire knowledge of human beings, to know the history of civilization and culture
 hamaare purvapurushon se sabhi saadhaaran or asaadhaaran anubhav ham bhashaa ke madhyam se hi jaan sake hai
 Knowledge from all our scriptures and scriptures is dependent on language
 mahakavi dandi ne apane mahaan granth ‘kavyadarsh’ main bhashaa kii mahatta suchit karte hue likhaa haih- That is, this entire Bhuvan would have become dark, if the word-form light in the world was not the light of language
 spasht hi he ki yah kathan maanav bhashaa ko lakshya karke hi kaha gaya he
 The sounds that animals and birds take shelter to express their expressions may be language for them, but due to being ambiguous to humans, scholars have called it 'latent speech', which is language- Nothing matters from the point of view of science
 kyonki ‘avyakt vaak’ main shabd or arth donon hi aspasht bane rahete hai
 Humans also sometimes use signs of limbs, fidgeting, hand-to-feet, face etc
 to express their feelings, but in spite of being a language, it is not 'express speech'
 maanav bhashaa kii sabase badi visheshta yah hoti he ki vah ‘vyakt vaak’ arthath shabd or arth kii spashtataa liye hue hoti he
 According to Patanjali, the author of Mahabhashya, 'express speech' refers to the descriptive language
 yah satya he ki kabhi-kabhi sanketon or angabhangimaaon kii sahaayta se bhi hamaare bhav or vichaaron kaa preshan badi saralata se ho jaataa he
 In this way, those gestures become symbols of language, but the most appropriate means of expressing human emotion is the descriptive language which has been given the noun of 'express speech'
 is main vibhinn arthon ko prakat karne ke liye kuch nischit uccharit yaa kathith dhvaniyon kaa aashray liya jaataa he
 Therefore, language is called a group of words which are filled with signs of different meanings
 jinke dwaara ham apane manobhaav saralata se dusron ke prati prakat kar sakate hai
 Thus, while defining the language, we can call it a medium adopted to exchange thoughts and expressions in human society, which holds the meaningful basis for the sounds that have been effortlessly ejected from the utterances of humans
 wo dhwani-samooh shabd kaa rup tab lete hai jab ve kisi arth se jud jate hai
 Entire phonology is based on a 'random' relationship with its meaning
 ‘yadrichhik’ kaa arth he purnataya kalpit
 In short, we call that word group pronounced with different meanings expressed in different meanings through which we convey our feelings and thoughts to others
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke adhyayan se hamen anek laabh hote hai, jaise- 1
 Satisfaction of curiosity or elimination of doubts about your familiar language
 2
 aitihaasik tathaa pragaitihaasik samskruti kaa parichay
 3
 Introduction to mental development of any caste or entire humanity
 4
 pracheen sahitya kaa arth, uccharan evam prayog sambandhi anek samasyaon kaa samaadhaan
 5
 Development of a language for the world
 6
 videshi bhashaaon ko seekhney main sahaayta
 7
 Assistance in the development and manufacture of translation and self-typing and similar machines
 8
 bhashaa, lipi aadi main saralata, shuddhta aadi kii drushti se parivartan-parivardhan main sahaayta
 In view of all these benefits, linguistics is considered to be a very useful subject in today's age and its field of study is constantly developing
 bhashaa ek prakritik vastu he jo maanav ko ishwariya vardaan ke rup main mili hui he
 Language is formed by naturally sounding sounds from the mouth of man
 bhashaa kaa saamaanya gyaan iske bolne or sunne vaale sabhi ko ho jaataa he
 This is called general knowledge of language
 iske aage, bhashaa kab bani, kaise bani ? iskaa praarambhik evam pracheen swaroop kya tha ? isamen kab-kab, kya-kya parivartan hue or un parivartanon ke kya kaaran hai ? athwa kul milakar bhashaa kaise viksit hui ? us vikaas ke kya kaaran hai ? koun si bhashaa kis duusari bhashaa se kitni samanta yaa vishmata rakhti he ? yah sab bhashaa kaa vishesh gyaan yaa ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ kaha jayega
 This particular form of linguistics, ie linguistics, has been considered as an important subject of study today
 bhashaa-vigyaan jab adhyayan ke vishyon main badi-badi kakshaon ke paathyakramon ke antargat sammilit kiya gaya to sarvapratham yah ek swaabhaavik prashn utpann hua ki bhashaa-vigyaan ko kala ke antargat gina jaae yaa vigyaan main
 That is, linguistics is art or science
 adhyayan kii prakriya evam nishkarshon ko lekar nishchay kiya jane laga ki vastutah use bhautik vigyaan, evam rasayan vigyaan aadi kii bhanti vishuddh vigyaan mana jaae athwa chitra, sangeet, murti, kavy aadi kalaon kii bhanti kala ke rup main sweekaar kiya jaae
 Art is related to human beings objects or subjects
 yahi kaaran he ki kala vyakti pradhan yaa purnatah vaiyaktik hoti he
 Apart from being relative, a particular country and period also have an influence on art
 iskaa abhipraay yah he ki kisi kaal main kala ke prati jo mulya rahete hai unamem kaalaantar main naye-naye parivartan upasthit ho jate hai tathaa ve kisi duusare desh main bhi maan liye jaaen, yah bhi aavashyak nahin he
 a person is feeling high artistic expression in an object
 kintu duusare ko vah is prakaar kii na lag rahi ho
 Therefore, the perception of art varies from person to person
 kala kaa sambandh maanav hriday kii ragatmik vritti se hota he
 There is a mixture of aesthetics of the person in it
 kala kaa uddeshy bhi soundaryanubhuti karana, yaa anand pradaan karnaa he, kisi vastu kaa tathvik vishleshan karnaa nahin
 The test of all these characteristics of the nature of art shows that linguistics is not art
 kyonki uskaa sambandh hriday kii sarasata-vritti se na hokar buddhi kii tatvagrahi drushti se hota he
 The aim of linguistics is not to provide beauty or entertainment
 vah to hamaare bauddhik chintan ko prakhar banaata he
 Elemental assessment of the existence of language
 uskaa drushtikon buddhivaadee he
 The findings of linguistics do not change on the basis of any person, nation or period and the basic basis of the study of linguistics, which is language, is not a humanized substance
 atah bhashaa-vigyaan ko ham kala ke kshetra main nahin gin sakate
 The usefulness of linguistics is that it teaches the art of language teaching
 isi kaaran sweet ne vyakaran ko bhashaa ko kala tathaa vigyaan donon kaha he
 Pure pronunciation, effective use of language can be placed in the category of art
 bhashaa-vigyaan ko kala kii seemaa main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa, yah nishchay ho jane par yah prashn uthta he ki kya bhashaa-vigyaan, bhautik-shaastra, rasayan-vigyaan aadi vishyon kii bhanti purnatah vigyaan he ? In the belief of many scholars, linguistics is not a pure science
 unki dharna ke anusaar abhi bhashaa-vigyaan ke sabhi prayog purnataa ko praapt nahin hue hai or uske nishkarshon ko isiilie antim nishkarsh nahin kaha ja saktaa
 At the same time, not all conclusions of linguistics are as universal and eternal as science
 jis prakaar ganit shaastra main 2 + 2 = 4 saarvkalik, vikalparahit nishkarsh he jo sarvatra sweekaar kiya jaataa he, bhashaa-vigyaan ke paas is prakaar ke vikalp-rahit nirvivaad nishkarsh nahin he
 In science, facts are compiled and analyzed, and the laws of sound are mostly non-committal, so according to some scholars, linguistics can be placed between humanities and science
 vichaar karne par ham dekhte hai ki vigyaan kii aaj kii durat pragati main prayek vishesh gyaan apane aagaamee gyaan ke saamne purana or avaigyanik siddh hota ja rahaa he
 In today's era of continual innovators, the scientific view is constantly going from micro to micro and new to new
 aaj ke viksit gyaan-kshetra ko dekhte hue kai vaigyanik manyataayen puraani or feeki pad gai he
 Newton's theory of light is also now being viewed with suspicion
 isse yah siddh hota ho jaataa he ki nutan gyaan ke prakaash main puraatan gyaan bhi vigyaan ke kshetra se baahar kar diya jaataa he
 Therefore, considering it from the point of view of pure knowledge, we find linguistics within the range of science itself
 bhashaa-vigyaan nishchay hi ek vigyaan he jiske antargat ham bhashaa kaa vishesh gyaan praapt karte hai
 It is true that linguistics has not yet been fully developed on a scientific level
 yahi kaaran he ki prasiddh grim-niyam ke aage chal kar grassmaan or varnor ko usamen sudhaar karnaa padaa he
 Prior to the above reforms, the sound rule of Grimm was considered to be the definite rule and even after the reforms it is considered to be the definite rule
 is prakaar naye gyaan ke prakaash main puraane siddhanton kaa khandan hone se vigyaan kaa koi virodh nahin he
 Actually this is pure science
 san 1930 ke baad jahaan varnanaatmak bhashaa-vigyaan ko punah mahatva praapt hua, vahaan tab se lekar aaj tak drut gati main vikaas hua he
 Ever since new tests have started with the help of instruments in the field of sound and the conclusions obtained have started to be completely regular, since then linguistics has gradually started to be considered in the category of science
 vigyaan kii ek badi visheshta he uskaa prayogtmak hona
 After American scholar Baloom Field, American linguists have developed experimental linguistics with great intensity as a new method of linguistics with phonology and morphology etc
 is paddati ke antargat bhashaa-vigyaan prayogshaalaon kaa vishay banataa ja rahaa he or uske liye anek yantron kaa avishkaar ho gaya he
 Seeing this, this subject will definitely be called science, there is no doubt in it at all
 aajkal jabaki samaaj-vigyaan, manovigyaan aadi shastreey vishyon ke liye jahaan vigyaan shabd kaa prayog karne kii parampara chal padi he tab shuddh kaaran-kaary parampara par aadhaarit bhashaa-vigyaan ko vigyaan kahana kisi bhi drushti se anuchit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Dr
 Shyamsunder Das has written in his book Language Secret- mangal dev shastri ke shabdon main- This definition is given in Dr
 Bholanath Tiwari's 'linguistics' text as follows- upar di gai sabhi paribhaashaon par vichaar karne se gyaat hota he ki unamem paraspar koi antar nahin he
 In the definition of Dr
 Shyamsunder Das, where the focus has been on linguistics only, Mangaldev Shastri and Bholanath Tiwari have included the types of study of linguistics in their definitions
 paribhaasha vah acchhee hoti he jo sankshipt ho or spasht ho
 Thus, we can give a new definition of linguistics in this way - "the study by which the study of human languages is subtle and analytical is called linguistics
" ” In other words, linguistics is that in which subtle and extensive scientific study of human languages is done
 bhashaa ke prachlit vartmaan swaroop ko chhod kar shesh sari adhyayan saamagree bhashaa-vigyaan ko sahitya se hi uplabdh hoti he
 If Sanskrit, Greek and Avesta literature were not in front of us today, linguistics would never have been successful in knowing that these three languages originated from any one native language
 isi prakaar adikaal se lekar aadhunik kaal tak kaa hindi sahitya hamaare saamne na hota to bhashaa-vigyaan hindi bhashaa ke aitihaasik vikaas kaa adhyayan kis prakaar kar paata
 Linguistics to study language in any way, he has to take help of literature on foot
 bundelkhand ke natkhat baalkon ke munh se yah sun kar- The grammar says what a problem this is, only the study of ancient literature will tell him that this is the impaired form of the first sutra of Shaktayan, 'un Namah Siddham'
 sahitya bhi bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta se apni anek samasyaon kaa samaadhaan khojane main safal ho jaataa he
 Dr
 Vasudev Sharan Aggarwal has clarified their meanings by linking many words of 'padmavat' with their original forms, validated on the basis of linguistic principles
 saath hi shuddh paath ke nirdhaaran main bhi isse paryaapt sahaayta lee he
 Hence, both literature and linguistics are supportive of each other
 bhashaa hamaare bhaavon-vichaaron arthath man kaa pratibimb hoti he atah bhashaa kii sahaayta se bahut se samasyaon ko suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Economics in particular is completely based on psychology
 vaakya-vigyaan ke adhyayan main bhi manovigyaan se paryaapt sahaayta milti he
 Sometimes psychology also helps us to know the cause of sound changes
 bhashaa kii utpatti tathaa praarambhik rup kii jaankaree main bhi bal-manovigyaan tathaa aviksit logon kaa manovigyaan hamaari sahaayta karata he
 Psychology also has to seek help from linguistics in its medical practice to know the meaning of the patient
 atah bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta se ek manovigyaani rogi kii manogranthiyon kaa pataa lagane main safal ho saktaa he
 Due to the close relationship between linguistics and psychology, a new study method is being developed nowadays called Language Psychology or Psycholinguistics
 bhashaa mukh se nikalne vaali dhwani ko kehete hai atah bhashaa-vigyaan main hawa bheetar se kaise chalati he, swaryantr, swartantri, nasikavivar, kauwa, taalu, daant, jeebh, onth, kanth, moorddha tathaa naak ke kaaran usamen kya parivartan hote hai tathaa kaan dwaara kaise dhwani grahan kii jaati he, in sabakaa adhyayan karnaa padataa he
 Physiology only helps him in this
 likhit bhashaa kaa grahan aankh dwaara hota he or is prakriya kaa adhyayan bhi bhashaa-vigyaan ke antargat hi hota he
 For this also he has to be indebted to physiology
 bhashaa-vigyaan or bhugol kaa bhi-gaharaa sambandh he
 According to some people, the geographical conditions of a place have a profound influence on its language
 kisi sthaan main boli jane vaali bhashaa main vahaan ke ped-paudhe, pakshi, jeev-jantu evam ann aadi ke liye shabd avashya milte hai parantu yadi unamem se kisi kii samaapti ho jaae to uskaa naam vahaan kii bhashaa se bhi juda ho jaataa hai
 The word 'somlata' is not used in our language today
 is lop kaa kaaran sambhavtah bhugolic hi he
 Geographic conditions are also the result of lack of a language spread in a place, less development in language and many dialects in a place
 durgam parvaton par rahane vaali jatiyon kaa paraspar kam sampark hone ke kaaran unki boli prasar nahin kar paati
 The dialect of people living across rivers differs from the common language
 deshon, nagaron, nadiyon tathaa praanton aadi ke naamon kaa bhashaa-vaigyanik adhyayan karne main bhugol badi manoranjak saamagree pradaan karata he
 Even in the field of economics, geography helps linguistics
 ‘ushtr’ kaa arth bhainsa se oont kaise ho gaya tathaa ‘saindhav’ kaa arth ghoda or namak hi kyon hua, aadi samasyaon par vichaar karne main bhi bhugol sahaayta karata he
 language-geography, a branch of linguistics, is just like geography
 isi prakaar kisi sthaan ke pragautihaasik kaal ke bhugol kaa adhyayan karne main bhashaa-vigyaan bhi paryaapt sahaayak hota he
 History is also closely related to linguistics
 itihaas ke teen roopon raajnneetik itihaas, dharmik itihaas, saamaajik itihaas-ko lekar yahan bhashaa-vigyaan se uskaa sambandh dikhalaayaa ja rahaa he- Other areas of knowledge like logic, physics and anthropology also provide great help in the study of linguistics
 manushya main anek prakaar ke andhvishwaas ghar kar lete hai jinka uski bhashaa par prabhaav padataa he
 In Indian society, women take their husbands' names in a twisted way, not outright
 raatri main vishaal keedon kaa naam nahin liya jaataa he
 They name their boy Mange, Chedi, Bechu, Ghurahu, Katwaru Alichar or Lendha, etc
 andhvishwaason ke atirikt anya bahut si saamaajik-manovigyaan se sambaddh gutthiyon ke spashtikaran ke liye maanav-vigyaan kii shakha-prashakhaon kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 In this way, many fields of knowledge- culture-studies, pedagogy, statistics, text-science, etc
 have a deep connection with linguistics
 maanav kii bhashaa kaa jo kshetra he vahi bhashaa-vigyaan kaa kshetra he
 The languages and dialects of civilized and uncivilized humans around the world are studied under linguistics
 is prakaar bhashaa-vigyaan keval sabhy-saahitiyik bhashaaon kaa hi adhyayan nahin karata apitu asabhy-barbar-asaahitiyik boliyon kaa, jo prachlan main nahin he, ateet ke garv main khoi hui hai un bhashaaon kaa bhi adhyayan iske antargat hota he
 Linguistics is divided into language structure and 'study of meaning' from the point of view of subject division
 isamen bhashaa kaa vaigyanik drushtikon se vishleshan or varnan karne ke saath hi vibhinn bhashaaon ke bich tulanaatmak adhyayan bhi kiya jaataa he
 Linguistics has two sides - elemental and applied
 iske atirikt bhashavigyaan kaa gyaan-vigyaan kii anyaanya shakhaon ke saath gaharaa sambandh he
 This has led to the development of various branches of sociolinguistics, psychodynamics, academic linguistics, etc
 bhashavigyaan ke gaun kshetra nimnlikhit hai- Syntax: In language, all thought-exchange is done on the basis of sentences
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke jis vibhaag main is par vichaar kiya jaataa he use vaakya-vichaar yaa vaakya-vigyaan kehete hai
 It has three forms - vaakya-rachana kaa sambandh bolanewaale samaaj ke manovigyaan se hota he
 Therefore this branch of linguistics is very difficult
 rup-vigyaan : vaakya kii rachana padon yaa roopon ke aadhaar par hoti he
 Therefore, the idea of verse or form becomes important after a sentence
 rup-vigyaan ke antargat dhaatu, upsarg, pratyay aadi un sabhi upkarnon par vichaar karnaa padataa he jinase rup banate hai
 Phonology: The base word of form or verse
 shabdon par rachana yaa itihaas in do drushtiyon se vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 The idea of a person or language is also done under it
 kosh-nirmaan tathaa vyutpatti-shaastra shabd-vigyaan ke hi vichaar-kshetra kii seemaa main aate hai
 The cultural history of the speaker can be known on the basis of the word group of the language
 dhwani-vigyaan : shabd kaa aadhaar he dhwani
 Sounds are studied in many ways under phonology
 iske antargat dhwani-shaastra ek alag se upavibhag he jisamen dhwani utpann karne vaale angon-mukh-vivar, nasika-vivar, swar tantri, dhwani yantra ke saath-saath sunne kii prakriya kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 There are two forms of this study - historical and second comparative
 grim niyam kaa sambandh isi se he
 Economics: The outer part of the sentence ends on the sound
 It is the outer body of the language, next to it the field of his soul begins which we call the meaning
 arth-rahit shabd atmarahit sharir kii bhanti vyarth hota he
 Therefore, meaning is an important part of language
 arth-vigyaan main shabdon ke arthon kaa vikaas tathaa uske kaarnon par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 We call any study a scientist when we follow a certain process in it
 bhashaa vigyaan bhi kisi bhashaa ke kaaran-kaaryparak yuktipurna vivechan-vishleshan ke liye kuch nishchit prakriyaaon main bandha kar chalata he
 On the basis of these processes, so far we have received five types of studies of linguistics- saamanyatya bhashaa kaa adhyayan nimnaankit drushtiyon se kiya jaataa he : By descriptive method, the form of one language of the same period is analyzed
 iske liye isamen un siddhanton par prakaash daalaa jaataa, jinke aadhaar par bhashaa-vishesh kii rachanaagat visheshtaon ko spasht kiya ja sake
 It is important to note that in this method language cannot be included in different periods simultaneously, because the analysis of language of every age will have the purpose of separate principles
 panini na keval bharat ke, apitu sansar ke sabase bade bhashavigyaani hai, jinhone varnanaatmak rup main bhashaa kaa vishad evam vyapak adhyayan kiya
 Katyayan and Patanjali also fall in this category
 greek vidwaanon main thraiks, discolas tathaa erodian ne bhi is kshetra main ullekhya kaary kiya tha
 Fully influenced by Panini, Bloomfield paved the way for the development of descriptive linguistics by publishing his book 'language' in 1932 AD
 idhar pashchimi deshon - visheshkar america main varnanaatmak bhashavigyaan kaa aashaatheet vikaas hua he
 The purpose of historical linguistics is to consider changes in different periods in a language and to formulate theories in relation to those changes
 varnanaatmak paddati kaa mul antar yah he ki varnanaatmak paddati jahaan ekakalik he, vahaan aitihaasik paddati dvikalik
 The antiquity of the Sanskrit language attracted the attention of linguists towards the historical method
 'filology' kaa mukhya pratipaadya pracheen granthon kii bhashaaon kaa tulanatamak adhyayan hi tha
 The focus of the scholars was mainly on languages like Sanskrit, German, Greek, Latin
 fredrick ougust woolf ne san 1777 i
 main hi aitihaasik paddati kii ore vidwaanon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya tha
 In fact, to understand the developmental form of any language one has to resort to historical method
 puraani hindi athwa madhyakaalin hindi or aadhunik hindi main kya parivartan hua he, ise aitihaasik paddati dwaara hi spasht kiya ja saktaa he
 Two or more languages are compared by comparative method
 ise mishrit paddati bhi kah sakate hai, kyonki vivarnaatmak paddati tathaa aitihaasik paddati donon kaa aadhaar liya jaataa he
 One has to define a period for description and at least two languages are required for comparison
 is prakaar, tulanaatmak paddati ko varnanaatmak paddati or aitihaasik paddati kaa yoga kaha ja saktaa he
 The comparative method can apply to any two languages
 jaise, bhartiya bhashaaon - bhojpuri aadi main bhi paraspar tulana kii jaati he yaa phir hindi-angareji, hindi-roosi, hindi-farsi kaa bhi tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 That is, there is no territorial limit
 wiliam jones, france bopp, maxmooler, curtius, ougust shlikhar prabhruti vidwaanon ne tulanaatmak bhashavigyaan ke vikaas main mahatvapurn yogadan kiya he
 However, so far there is a great lack of principles in comparative linguistics, on the basis of which the classification of two different languages could not become scientific
 sanrachanaatmak paddati varnanaatmak paddati kii agali kadi he
 This method is getting special publicity in America
 isamen yantric upkarnon ko adhik mahatva diya ja rahaa he, jisase anuwaad karne main vishesh suvidha hogi
 Jaelig Harris developed this method by writing a book titled 'methods in Structural Linguistics'
 vigyaan kii anya shakhaon ke samaan bhashavigyaan ke bhi prayogtmak paksh hai, jinke liye prayog kii pranaaliyon or prayogshaala kii apeksha hoti he
 Phonetic phonology, physical phonology and auditory phonology are studied by various mechanical experiments
 ise praayogic swanvigyaan, yantric swanvigyaan yaa prayogshaala swanvigyaan bhi kehete hai
 In this, from simple equipment like mirrors to the most complex electrical devices are being used
 parinamswaroop bhashavigyaan ke kshetra main ganitagyon, bhautikashastriyon or enginiaron kaa purna sahyog apekshit ho gaya he
 With the help of the artificial palate and artificial palate projectors, the pronunciation space of the unmarked swans is tested by the individual
 kaaymograph swaanon kaa ghoshnatv or pranatv nirdhaaran karne anunasikta or kaalamaatra jaanane ke liye upyogi he
 Laryngeal scope studies the position of the larynx
 endoscope laringoscope kaa hi sudhara rup he
 The waves of the oscillograph imprint the physical appearance of the swans on the screen or on the film with great clarity
 yahi kaam spectograph yaa sonograph dwaara adhik safalataa se kiya jaataa he
 The images that the spectrograph presents can be heard again by pattern playback
 spichstrechar kii sahaayta se ricard kii hui saamagree ko dhimi gati se suna ja saktaa he
 Apart from these, there are other small and large instruments, from which adequate help is being taken in linguistic studies
 francisi bhashavaigyanikon main ruiyo ne swanvigyaan ke prayogon ke vishay main granth likhaa tha
 In London, Prof
 Firth developed a special palate
 swaron ke maapan ke liye jaise swaratrikon yaa chatushkon kii rekhaayen nirdhaarit kii gai hai, vaise hi inhone vyanjanon ke maapan ke liye aadhaar rekhaon kaa nirupan kiya, jinke dwaara uccharan sthanon kaa thik thik varnan kiya ja saktaa he
 Daniel Janse and Ida Ward have also done important work on English phonology
 francisi, german or roosi bhashaaon ke swanvigyaan par kaam karne waalon main kramash: armastrong, bithel or boyanas mukhya hai
 Among the people who work on theoretical and applied phonology equally, the following are the main ones: Stetson, Negus Potter, Green and Cop, Martin Juice, Hefner, Maul etc
 idhar ek nayaa yantric prayaas aarambh hua he jiskaa sambandh shabdaawalee, arthtatv tathaa vyakaranik roopon se he
 The use of electrical computers for mechanical translation is a special feature of the scientific era
