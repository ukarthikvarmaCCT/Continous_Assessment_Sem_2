 Unlawful or Unreasonable - Some officials add a criterion of the definition of terrorism to a "legitimate" government-authorized distinction between demeanor or impersonal action to make it legitimate and other actors, including those individuals and small groups
 The criterion, that terrorism otherwise The use of functions would not be justified as terrorism would not be considered if they were government approved
 If it were a "legitimate" government authorized by example For Rann, a city that is designed to influence civilian support for a reason, firebombing terrorism will not be considered
 This criterion is inherently and problematic because it is not universally accepted: this state Deny the existence of terrorism, whether it can perform the same task or as terrorism, based on whether its sponsorship is known to a "legitimate" government Security can not be; "validity" is kasuti saarvbhaumik sweekaar kiye jate hai nahin he in kaarnon ke liye

 Considerations as acts by states of violence to which states do not meet or sponsor terrorism vary widely
 jab rajyon samoohon kuch aatankwaadi hone dwaara vichaar ke liye dhan uplabdh karaate hai, ve kabhi kabhi hi jaise unhen sweekaar karte hai
 The concept of state terrorism is controversial
 Wars during military action by states are generally not considered terrorism, even when they involve significant civilian casualties

 This involves the use of state resources by employing foreign policies of a state, such as performing acts of state terrorism considered directly by using its military
 Professor of Political Science, Michael Stohl, of London, Germany Examples of bombing and US nuclear destruction include cites Hiroshima during World War II
 He said the use of terror tactics is more common in international relations that the state has been and remains a more likely possibility of terrorism than employer insurgents argue within the international system

 "ve kehete hai ki aatankwaad ke sansthagat rup he ki vishwa yuddh daaloonga nimnlikhit jagah le lee parivartan kaa ek parinaam ke rup main hui bahes he
 In this analysis, the presence of state terrorism as a form of foreign policy was shaped by the presence and use of weapons of mass destruction and shaped the rapidly growing accepted form of behavior of the state to lead such Legitimizing violent behavior of

 pratikriyaaon ko aatankwaad ke daayre main vyapak rahe hai
 They can include re-alignments of the fundamental values of the political spectrum and reassessments
 The word terrorism, implying that it is directed at terrorist actors, has a narrower connotation
 pratikriyaaon ke vishisht prakaar main shaamil hai: Media risk is the primary goal of taking them out of terrorism, to expose issues that would otherwise be ignored by the media
 kuch herpher or shoshan ko media ke liye is par vichaar karen
 Others, expressed by a view of itself, consider terrorism to be a symptom of a highly controlled mass media, which would otherwise not give voice to alternative viewpoints because Paul Watson who "filled you in any other way" i cannot find your information that the controlled media is responsible for terrorism, "he said
 paul watasan kaa sanghathan samudr Shepherd swayan kiya gaya "branded heparisthitiki aatankwaadi ", haalanki yah daawa he ki koi bhi hataahat kaaran nahin he

 hindi vikipedia par vartmaan samay main 11 prabandhak hai
 In the early days of Wikipedia, each member worked as a manager using a single password
 yah password swatantra rup se saunp diya jaataa tha
 The outgoing administratorship of Wikipedia is the result of a code modification that made the process role-based access control instead of using a single password to perform this task
 is karypranali main vyaktigat khate ko kuch vishisht aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne par ek yaa ek saddhik flag diya jaataa he, jo us khatadharak ko samaanya sampadakon se alag kuch upkarnon ko upyog karne kii suvidha detaa he
 During this transition it was emphasized that managers should never develop into a particular subgroup
 balki, prabandhakon ko anya sampadakon kii tarah samudaay kaa ek hissaa hona chahie, iske saath hi jab ye sampadak ke rup main kaary karen to inhen koi vishesh shaktiyaan yaa visheshadhikaar nahin milane chahie
 It has always been assumed that the manager is not a particular part of the society but a member of it
 dekha jaye to vikipedia ke adhiktar prabandhan ke kaary koi bhi kar saktaa he, jinke liye kisi vishisht takneekee upkarnon kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti jo prabandhakon ko die gaye hai
 According to Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales: main yah kahana chahta hoon ki sis-ope bananaa *koi bahut badi baat nahin he*
 i believe that i will give this right to those people who have been active here for some time
 main prabandhak shabd ke hauve ko samaapt karnaa chahta hoon
 It is only technical that someone was selected to do some of the main technical work here, not all
 main nahin chahta ki koi soche kii prabandhak pad koi vishesh tamgaa he
 This whole statement can be interpreted that it is not just a manager as much as it is important to responsibly and correct technical tasks
 vikipedia ke anusaar koi tay niyam nahin he jinase ki koi prabandhak ban saktaa or nahin
 Any manager can apply for the post
 aavedak kaa purv main vikipedia par anubhav ke bajaay yahan us par vishwaas hona adhik aavashyak hoga
 But still the work done by the applicant in the past is important
 har sampadak kii drushti main kisi pratyaashee ke bare main alag-alag vichaar ho sakate he
 Getting their trust is dependent on their thoughts about you
 namakan ke liye nivedan karne se pehle yaa kisi or dwaara kiye gaye aapke namakan ko swikaarne se pehle yah dhyaan de ki pratyaashee ko kam se kam kuch maheene se vikipedia par sakriy hona chahie, yahan ke kaamo se parichit hona chahie ki kya kaise kiya jaataa he
 He should believe in good behavior and the guidelines of Wikipedia policy and gain the trust of society
 yadi aap prabandhak ke sabhi kanoonon or niti nirdeshon se sahamat he to aap apane namakan ke liye nivedan se sambandhit adhik jaankaree ke liye chaoupal par jaaen
 After the nomination, it will be discussed by the society and not by any vote
 lagbhag ek saptaah baad yaa jaise ki prashaasak kii manshaa ho is charchaa ko samaapt kar use par nirnay liya jaayegaa
 If more than 80% of the people in the talks discuss the candidate's support, the administrator nominates him or her as a manager
 dhyaan rakhe kisi vyakti dbaara bhale hi kitne bhi khate vikipedia par ho par unamem se keval ek ko hi prabandhak ke adhikaar die ja sakate he
 Once a manager is created, it can be perpetual until it is removed for any specific reason, which often results in Wikipedia breaking the rules or misusing its rights
 yadi aapako prabandhak bana diya jaataa he to aapako mili nae adhikaron kaa upyog karne main aapako vishesh saavdhaanee baratani chahie
 Specifically erasing articles and pages and banning members according to IP addresses
 aapako apane nae adhikaron kaa kaise upyog karnaa he or kya kare yaa na karen ke liye yah nirdesh dekhen yaa pehle se hi prabandhak pad par karyrat sadasyon se raay len
 Please do not hesitate
 prabandhak ke adhikaron kaa upyog karnaa aap ke swayan ke nirnay par nirbhar karata he or yah seekhney samajhane main bahut samay lag saktaa he ki kis tul ko kaise or kab prayukt kiya jaae or kitne samay ke liye
 Such as securing pages and articles or banning a member
 nae prabandhakon ko paraamarsh diya jaataa he ki vah nae mili pad par dhire-dhire apane kaaryo ko armbh karen, samajhe or aage badhen
 Do not adopt a policy of doing everything together
 yah bhi aashaa kii jaati he ki prabandhak apane khaaton kii suraksha par vishesh dhyaan rakhenge
 Keep the keys of your accounts hard which cannot be broken or thought, and also keep the security of the email address associated with your account secure
 prabandhak ke adhikaron ko vikipedia ke in kaaryo ko karne ke liye vishesh rup se prayukt kiya ja saktaa he: The managers are expected to present an example for everyone and always practice temper and restraint while interacting with others
 prabandhko se yah bhi aashaa kii jaati he kii vah vikipedia ke niyam maane or apane kaaryo ko achche dhang se kare
 Sometimes a mistake can be made, after all the managers are also human beings and sometimes the faults can be forgiven
 haalanki vikipedia ko baari kshati pahunchaane vaale dosha par yaa lagaataar galat nirnay yaa kaary karne par unhen is pad se hataaya bhi ja saktaa he
 Managers and experienced writers should behave in a manner that sets an example for other members
 prabandhakon ko yah dhyaan rakhana chahie kii vikipedia ke ho rahe vikaas ke is tej daur main unke saath yahan or bhi kai prabandhakon va saathi he
 If they feel that they are unable to take a right or just decision on a subject, then they should ask for help from other friends and discuss those topics in the chaupal and the society, it is not that they are making wrong decisions in the course of their decision making
 Take it
 prabandhak apane dwaara kiye gaye prabandhan kaaryon ke liye purnatah uttardaai he
 Such as the use of the rights and tools given to them, by which they can hurt or harm other editors who do not have the same rights as them
 kisi bhi sampadak yaa sadsy ko kisi prabandhak dwaara kiye kaam kii aalochana karne kaa puraa adhikaar he jab tak kii yah sammanjanak dhang se, tameez ke daayre main or dwesh kii bhaavana se otprot hokar na kiya jaae
 It is expected from the managers that they should not reply to such criticism in a wrong way and answer it with full responsibility and well-being and if there is any mistake, take it with a clear mind
 aise prabandhak jinhone kii samaaj kaa apane upar se vishwaas kho diya he va jinke dwaara baar-baar doshapurn vyavhaar hota he unhen is pad se hataaya ja saktaa he
 This is the reason many managers have been removed in the past: agar kisi sadsy ko lagata he kii kisi prabandhak ne uske khilaaf galat nirnay liya he to use us prabandhak se sidhe is masale par shishtachar ke saath baat kerani chahie or is masale ko sulajhane kii koshish kerani chahie
 Avoid using the wrong words in spite or hatred
 haalanki, agar donon pakshon main yah masalaa nahin sulajhe to ise vikipedia:chaoupal main uthaaya ja saktaa he yaa anya prabandhakon se is bare main baat karen
 You can also send email directly to them
 apane prabandhak upkarnon or adhikaron kaa durupyog ek gambhir masalaa he va vikipedia ke niyamon ke viruddh he
 All these rights give a member some importance of the Wikipedia system work and they should not be misused in any case
 har haalat main inkaa soch samaj kar upyog kare, galat upyogon ke kaaran yah waapas bhi liye ja sakate he
 Common situations where you can avoid exercising your managerial rights: prabandhko ko aise maamlo main apane adhikaron ke upyog se bachanaa chahie jinamein wo khud shaamil ho, un par apane adhikaron kaa phayda uthaane kaa aarope lag saktaa he
 In such a situation let someone else take the decision
 agar vikipedia ke kisi niyam main yah likhaa he kii kinhin kaamon main yaa vajahon main prabandhko ko apane adhikaron yaa upkarnon kaa upyog nahin karnaa chahie, to naa hi kare
 In some cases, if used on the basis of exception, then there should be strong reason for it and it would be appropriate to discuss the chaupal before that
 kisi bhi prabandhak ko apane hi jaise saathi prabandhak ke dwaara kiye gaye kaary ko badalanaa yaa uske khilaaf kaarywahi karne se bachanaa chahie
 If necessary, first talk and see what is the real issue
 miljulkar kaary kare
 If a work has been changed or any right has been withdrawn from someone, do not undo it without consensus
 har baar khud nirnay lene se bache va jaruri hone pe anya prabandhko se salaah le va unhen nirnay lene de
 It is not necessary that you can take the right decision in every issue, but someone else can definitely take it
 miljul kar kaary karnaa jaruri he
 It should be kept in mind that if a manager has exercised his rights on a member, article, confirmation, dispute etc
, and if it is proper, subject to practice, and brief, then it is the same articles, confirmation, controversies and May exercise those rights with members again
 It does not matter that he was also involved in the past
 This is because the manager's job is to do such work
 Yes, if he wants, he can soak it under a good habit to do it to another manager, but it is not necessary to do so
 agar maamla purv jaisaa hi he va unhi kaarnon ke vajah se jaach main aayaa he to yah ho saktaa he kii prabandhak kaa nirnay us maamle main pehle jaisaa hi ho
 a manager cannot be considered to have an issue or dispute with a member merely because he had previously issued a warning to him that was due to something he had done that had broken the Wikipedia rule
 In this way, any such article or any action against a member in future cannot be taken in malice or under the charge of "involvement in himself"
 haalaaki phir bhi, agar aisi ummid ho kii yah sab bate uth sakati he, to sabase badia to yah hi rahegaa kii aise maamlo main nirnay koi anya prabandhak leleve, va aap usko yah kaary dedeve
 Provision to remove a member from the post of Manager / Administrator is available in some wikis and not in some wikis
 jaise saadhaaran angreji viki par prashaasak prabandhak ko hataa sakate he is prakaar kuch anya viki pariyojnaon par bhi prabandhak ko hataane ke praavdhaan hai
 In French Wikipedia, managers who have been inactive for more than 6 months have been continuously removed, which is why there is no misuse of accounts of managers by hacking due to promotion of new skilled active members and long absence
 
 As the management name itself makes it clear that managing many important tasks on important occasions, therefore active presence on the wiki of members with management rights is a must
 ab hindi viki par kai sadsytaayen bhi bana di gayi hai jinase kaary vishesh hetu prabandhak bananaa aavashyak bhi nahin rahaa
 Members can get the rights of the manager in which they consider themselves efficient
 haan prabandhak ke kai kaary yaa jo kaary naye sadasyon kii seemaa se baahar hai, ityadi ke liye prabandhan adhikaar hetu samast sadasyon kaa swaagat he
 On the lines of all these wikis, on the Hindi wiki too, administrators can be relieved of posts by the administrators for the following reasons: 
 Often any debate with the managers should be resolved by negotiation and discussion on the chaupal
 par agar yah maamla koi baari galati se yaa prabandhak ke dwaara kiye gaye nuksaan yaa dwesh purna ravaiye se taalluk rakhata ho to is tarah se bhi masalaa suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 In such a case, the work done by a manager can be discussed
 agar kisi sadsy ko pratibandhit kar diya ho to vah kisi anya sadsy ke dwaara yah karvaa saktaa he
 You can talk to the administrator directly on this issue and appeal for immediate help from them
 prabandhko se yah aashaa kii jaati he ki vah apni or vikipedia kii suraksha ko dhyaan main rakhte hue or apane ko die hue vishesh adhikaron kii suraksha ke liye apane vikipedia khato par khaas dhyaan de
 They should choose their strong keys to increase the security of their accounts
 saath hi aise khaaton ke saath jude email paton kii bhi suraksha par dhyaan dena chahie
 Remember that if managers are unable to protect their accounts or because of these reasons there is a threat to the security of Wikipedia, then they can be removed from this post
 aisa nirnay hameshaa ke liye ho saktaa he

 This list is a list of managers who have been active on the Hindi wiki in recent times

 Whenever a manager is active, add his name to this list
 yah suchi sadasyon kii samasyaon ko shighrata se sulajhane ke liye banaayi gayi he
 Please don't take it otherwise is suchi main hindi vikipidia ke purv prabandhakon ko rakhaa gaya he - Most of these members have been relieved of management rights due to prolonged inactivity as per the policies for member rights, the Hindi wiki is thankful to these managers for their support and contribution
 pun: sakriy hone par yah sadsy sadsy adhikaar hetu nitiyon ke anusaar phir se yah adhikaar praapt kar sakate he
 In this list, those managers of Hindi wiki have been misused by their managerial rights, as a result of which they have been suspended from their managerial rights- nirdeshaank: 25°09′N 85°27′E / 25

 Massage and fomentation are harmful

 The clothes they wear and use chemicals should be changed immediately after work, so that the bad effects of those substances on the body do not last long
 aajkal pragatisheel deshon main audyogic sansthaayen in samast baton par puraa puraa dhyaan rakhti hai or is baat par bhi dhyaan detii hai ki kaarkaanon kii twachaa par bura prabhaav na daal saken

 log yah sochate hai ki in rogon ke jeevanuon ko maarane ke liye teevr se teevr aushadhiyon kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 This idea is pure and wrong
 aisa karne se twachaa ko bahut haani pahunchati he
 People should know that all those diseases, in which itching is a common prefix, occur due to different reasons

 yaa anya aushadhiyon kaa prayog chikitsak kii sanmati ke anusaar karen
 To get rid of itching and lice, other things do not benefit as much from the above mentioned medicines
 daad par aisa maraham na lagaana chahie, jo twachaa ko haani pahunchaae
 The disease is more commonly seen in sweaty areas
 is kaaran aise sthanon ko powder dwaara sookhaa rakhana chahie
 Also, ointment and powder should be used continuously for some time even after the curing of ringworm
 is rog ke liye abhi ek aisi aushadhi nikali he jo tikia ke rup main khai jaati he
 It is very beneficial for the disease

 yah rog aise vyaktiyon ko hota he jinamein maansik durbalata hoti he or jiske kaaran ve bahya tathaa samvegatmak paristhitiyon se sahaj hi udwelit ho jate hai
 It has been proved by current research that this mental disease occurs in both men and women
 pracheen tathaa madhyakaalin yug main is rog kaa kaaran bhoot-pret mana jaataa tha
 For its treatment, chandeliers, dirty amulets etc
 were used
 aadhunik kaal main shaarakon, jaine, mottern prince or froid ityadi manovaigyanikon ne iskaa kaaran maansik batalaaya he
 In mania, often the mental disorder changes into a physical disorder
 ribat kaa kathan he ki unmaad main maansik kshobh kii avasthaa shaareerik kriyaaon main prakat hoti he

 frid ne roopaantar unmaad, jisamen maansik viplav shaareerik lakshanon main parivartit ho jaataa he or chintaa unmaad, jisamen keval maansik lakshan hote he, kaa ullekh kiya he
 Froyd's exploration of mania is authentic
 froid ke drushtikon se unmaad ke rog main do baaten pramukhat: milti hai : Mania is often a re-remembering of sexual experiences
 aksar ve hi vyakti unmaad rog ke shikaar hote hai jinaki kaamashkti kaa uchit vikaas nahin ho paata

 Start treatment immediately with the advice of a psychiatrist

 Continuous use of medicines not only cures the present disease, but also reduces the possibility of re-emergence of the disease in future
 bina doctori salaah ke ilaaj band karne par beemaari ke dobaar hone kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Its treatment can go on for a long time, so the medicine should not be increased or decreased without consulting the doctor
 dawa khate hue kuch anaavashyak prabhaavon kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie jaise ki- Do not stop the use of the drug due to these unnecessary effects, as it reduces on its own over time, and common precautions can be taken to prevent them

 manorog, manovigyaan, sthaneey bhashaa or kanoon pravartan main shabd kii kai paribhaashaon ko paaya gaya he
 According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, pedophilia is a paraphilia in which a person becomes imaginative towards emotional and recurrent sexual urges towards young children and after which he either realistically fulfills it or causes distress
 Or mutual problem occurs
 vartmaan DSM-5 masauda ne prastaav naidanik maapdand ke liye hebephilia ko jodne kaa prastaav rakhaa or isiilie iskaa naam badal kar peedohebephilic vikaar rakhaa gaya
 Although the disorder occurs mostly in men, as well as some women in whom the disorder is found, and researchers believe the available estimate of pedophilia is small
 peedophilia ke liye kisi bhi prakaar ke ilaaj ko viksit nahin kiya gaya he
 However, there is some special therapy that can reduce the feeling of sexually abusing children in a person

 In common usage, pedophilia refers to sexual interest in any child or sexually abusing any child, often referred to as "pedophilic behavior"
 udhaaharan ke liye, da american heritage stedmans medical dictionari ne kaha ki, "peedophilia vayaskon kii ore se ek bachche yaa bacchon ke saath yon shoshan karne kaa ek gatividhi yaa kalpana he
 "this common use application also extends to sexual interest and children of younger age or older children are sexually abused
 shodhakarta suzav dete hai ki in galat upyogon se parhez kiya janaa chahie, kyonki jo log bacchon kaa yon shoshan karte hai saamaanya rup se ve maansik vikaar se grasit hote hai, lekin kuch apradhi peedophilia ke maanak nidaan se alag hote hai or naidanik nidaan maanak vayaskta kii aayu par pahunchane se thik purv umr ke bacchon ke saath sambandhit hota he
 Additionally, not all pedophiles actually abuse this type
 peedophilia ko sarvapratham 19 veen sadi ke uttarardh main aupchaarik rup se manyata dete hue naam diya gaya tha
 Significant research has been done in this area since the 1980s
 vartmaan main, peedophilia hone ke sahi kaarnon ko sthapit nahin kiya gaya he
 Research suggests that pedophilia may be correlated with many different neurological abnormalities and often present with other personality disorders and psychiatric malformations
 forencik manovigyaan or kanoon pravartan ke sandarbhon main vyavhaar or prerana ke anusaar peedophyle ke vargeekaran ke liye typology kii vividhta kaa suzav diya gaya he
 The word is derived from the Greek: παιδοφιλία παῖς, which means child and φιλία means "friendly love" or "friendship"
 In modern times, "child love" or "child lover" is used for pedophiles and is widely touted as romantic or sexual attraction
 
 Infantophilia, or napiophilia, is used to refer to sexual interest towards infants and young children
 peedophilia kaa istemaal 13 yaa usase kam umr ke bacchon ke saath vayaskon kii yon ruchi ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Hebephilia is defined primarily for the sexual interest of adults with children ages 11–14
 DSM IV ne nidaan main hebephilia ko suchi main nahin rakhaa he, jabaki ICD-10 peedophilia main hebephilia ko shaamil kiya he
 The term pedophilia erotica was coined in 1886 by the Viennese psychiatrist Richard von krafft-ebing in his Psychopathea Sexualise work
 yah shabd "chaudaa se kam varsh ke vyaktiyon kaa ulanghan" sheershak kii dhara main dikhaai detaa he, jisamen saamanytah bal shoshan aparaadhiyon ke forencik manorog ke pahalu par kendrit hota he
 kraft-ebbing describes several types of offenders, basically dividing them into psychopathological and non-psychopathological and speculating several obvious reasons that could lead to child abuse
 craft-abing ne "manovaigyanik yon vikruti" ke ek prakaar main peedophilia irotica kaa ullekh kiya he
 He wrote that he had faced this only four times in his career and gave a brief description of each case, which has three common characteristics: unhone peedophilia se grasit vayask mahilaon ke kai maamalon kaa ullekh kiya he or samalangik purushon dwaara ladakon ke saath durupyog ko atyant durlabh mana he
 To further clarify this, he indicated that cases of adult men who have some medical or neurological disorder and abuse with children do not have pedophilia and they are monitored by men who are adults and children
 
 unhone isse sambandhit sudopedophilia ko bhi suchi main rakhaa he, jisamen "hastmaithun ke madhyam se ve vyakti jo kamechha ko kho dete hai or baad main apni yon bhukh ke liye bacchon kii ore aakrishth ho jate hai, ise unhone sabase saamaanya lakshan mana he
 In 1908, the Swiss neuroanatomist and psychiatrist Auguste Fourl wrote about the phenomenon, proposing "pterosisi" as "sexual appetite for children"
 craft-abing ke kaam kii tarah phoel ne demenshia or anya jaivik mastishk sharto ke saath vyakti dwaara aakasmik yon shoshan or bacchon ke liye yon or kabhi kabhi vishesh tarjihi kii ichha ke bich antar ko banaaya
 haalanki, craft-abing ke baad main iske dirghasthayee hone or aparivartaneey hone ke vichaar se ve asahmat hue
 The term "pedophilia" for this condition has become generally accepted and seen extensively in the 20th century and found in the popular medical dictionary as the 5th edition of Stedman
 1952 main ise vikaar maansik or sankhyikee minial nidaan ke pehle sanskaran main shaamil kiya gaya
 The "sexual deviation" disorder was listed as a subtype of this version and the subsequent DSM-II classification but did not provide diagnostic criteria
 DSM-III, ko 1980 main prakashit kiya gaya jisamen vikaar kaa sampoorn varnan kiya gaya or nidaan ke disha nirdeshon ko pradaan kiya gaya
 Details were largely retained in the 1987 amendment R, DSM-III-, but provided updated and expanded diagnostic criteria
 kuch chikitsakon ne kuch or virgon ko prastaavit kiya jo ki kuch-kuch yaa peedophilia se bilkul bhinn the, isamen "peedohebephilia", "hebephilia" or "effebophilia" shaamil hai 
 karen franklin jaise anya visheshgy hebephilia ko "pritexual" nidaan ke rup main vargeekrut karte hai jise ek vikaar ke rup main nahin mana chahie
 The ICD-10 defines pedophilia as "sexual preference for children, boys, girls, or both, usually as a young or very young child
" "is pranali ke maapdand ke tahat 16 yaa usase adhik saal ke vyakti iske aadhaar par hota he yadi usase kam se kam paanch saal kam ke bacchon ke liye ek lagaataar yaa prabhavi yon ichha hoti he
 
 maansik vikaar paath avataran ke naidanik or sankhyikee minial ke chauthe sanskaran ne is vikaar ke nidaan main upyog ke liye vishisht mandandon kii ruparekha banaai he
 This includes the presence of imagined, sexual behavior arising out of behavior or solicitation in which sexual activity with a child of a young age lasts for about six months or longer, and for such desires patients suffer from these urges or distress
 maapdand se yah bhi sanket miltaa he ki rogi kaa 16 yaa usase adhik saal hona jaruri he or jis bachein ke baaren main vah sochataa he vah usase se kam se kam 5 saal chota hona chahie, haalanki 12-13 saal ke bachche or bade kishoron ko isse alag karne kii salaah di jaati he
 The diagnosis of the patient is further specified based on the sex of the child, if there are limited functions to impulse or incest and if "attraction" is "special" or "non-special"
 vaastavik peedophilia ko bataane ke liye kai shabdon kaa istemaal kiya gaya he, gaiyr-peedophilic se lekar gaiyr-vishesh apradhi, yaa peedophilic main ruchi aparath ke liye prerana ke anusaar aparaadhiyon ke prakaar ke bich bhed karne ke liye dekha gaya he
 Special pedophilia is sometimes referred to as "real pedophilia"
 ve keval bacchon se aakarshith hote hai
 In some cases they show interest in people of their age and this happens only when they imagine the presence of a child
 gaiyr-vishesh peedophilia ke rogi ko ek gaiyr-peedophilic apradhi ke rup main sanderbhit kiya ja saktaa he, lekin donon shabd hameshaa paryaay nahin hote hai
 Non-specialized pedophilia patients are attracted to both children and adults and have sexual desire by both, although sexual preference may be more present in the other than in one
 chote umr ke yuvaaon ke saath vaastavik yon gatividhi ke liye na to aisidi na hi DSM nidaan maapdand kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It can be diagnosed based on the presence of imagination or sexual urges, even if no such activity has ever happened
 On the other hand, a person who has experienced this and has not felt any kind of distress about his imagination or urges can also be diagnosed
 iske nidaan ke liye yon agrahon kii kriya sex tak simit nahin hoti or kabhi-kabhi abhadra pradarshan, voyoristic yaa froteristic yaa bal pronography ko dekhakar hastmaithun ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Often, context needs to be considered along with an element before clinical judgment in these tasks
 isi tarah, jab rogi adhik umr kaa kishor hota he, umr kaa antar or kathin nirdisht kiya jaataa he or iske bajaay sthiti kaa vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa kii hoti he
 Ego-dystonic sexual orientation includes those who are no doubt aware of their involvement in child sexual abuse but have a distinct desire for psychological and behavioral disorders
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan iske rogiyon ko unke yon unmukhikaran ko badalane ke liye ilaaj kii anumati detaa he
 The DSM IV criterion has been criticized for being more inclusive as well as less inclusive
 haalanki adhikansh shodhakartaaon ne bacchon ke kaami utpeedak ko peedophilia ke rogi se alag kiya he, stadar or elvin tark karte hai ki dsam maandand adhik samaveshi hote hai kyonki bal utpeedan ke sabhi krity nidaan ko nyaaysangat tehraate hai
 a child molestation a satisfies measurement punishments because it involves dealing with sexual activity with young children and criterion b because the person acts on those urges
 iske alaava, ve tark dete hai kii aise vyaktiyon ke maamle main yah kam-samaveshi hota he jo is par kriya nahin karte or isse vyathit nahin hote
 baad ke binduon ko kai anya shodhakartaaon dwaara nirmit kiya gaya jinhone kaha ki yah ek tathakthith "trupt peedophyle" he - ek aisa vyakti jo bachche ke saath yon kriya main lipt hone kii kalpana karata he or hastmaithun karata he, lokin kisi bachche ke saath kabhi sambhog kiya nahin he or jo uske baad rogi vyathit mahasoos nahin karata - peedophilia ke liye DSM-IV-TR maapdand ko puraa nahin karata he, kyonki yah vyakti maapdand bi ko puraa nahin karata he
 a large-scale survey of the use of various classification systems revealed that DSM classification is rarely used
 vivaran ke rup main ek suzav yah diya gaya tha ki kam samagrata ke saath-saath vaidhata, vishwasaneeyata or spashtataa kii kami ke kaaran DSM vargeekaran kii asweekruti kaa netritv kar saktaa he
 Ray Blanchard reviewed his literature for DSM-5, noted the objections and proposed to apply a general solution to the pedophile patient, that is, the difference between paraphilia and paraphilic disorder
 The latter term is proposed to identify a clinical condition that meets both criterion a and B, whereas a person who does not meet criterion b can determine, but cannot be diagnosed Is, since he has paraphilia
 DSM v ke liye maujuuda prastaav bhi peedophilia or hebeplia ke bich ek ekal naye nidaan peedohebephilic vikaar main donon nidaanon ke sangyojan dwaara vartmaan overlap kaa samaadhaan karegaa
 yah nayaa nidaan peedophilia kii ICD-10 paribhaasha ke liye baraabar hoga jisamen pehle se hi praarambhik pubesents shaamil hai
 However, o'donohue has taken the issue in a different direction, suggesting instead that diagnostic criteria alone may be simpler for children to lure if self-reports, laboratory findings, or past behavior To be traced He states that any sexual attraction towards children is pathological and that distress is irrelevant, commenting that "this sexual attraction has significant potential to harm others and is also not in the person's best interests

 In a 1993 review of child sexual abuse, Sharon Arazi and David Finkelhor said that due to undeveloped research related to the field, there is a lack of standardization in the use of the term "pedophilia" among researchers due to "technical problems" 
 unhone do paribhaasha kaa varnan kiya, ek "pratibandhaatmak" rup jo ki majboot or vishesh bacchon main yon ruchi ke saath logon kaa zikr kiya gaya he or ek "samgr" paribhaasha kaa varnan kiya gaya he, is shabd kaa vistaar kiya gaya he or vaise aparaadhiyon ko shaamil kiya gaya he jo anachar sahit ek bachche ke saath yon sampark main lage hai
 He said that he used a broad definition in his critical article so that practical criteria could be easily identified and complex analysis was not required for an individual's intention
 peedophilia kaa varnan yon variyata kaa ek vikaar ke rup main varnan kiya ja saktaa he, samalangik yaa vishamalangik unmukhikaran ke samaan ghatana kaa varnan ho sake kyonki iskaa udai chote umr ke pehle yaa uske dauraan panapata he or kyonki yah samay ke saath sthir hoti he
 However, these observations do not include pedophilia from a group of mental disorders because pedophilic action causes harm
 Sometimes pedophiles help honorary health professionals act by their impulses
 haalanki peedophilia ke hone kaa kaaran abhi tak gyaat nahin he, 2002 main shodhakartaaon ne peedophilia se sambandhit logon kii mastishk sanrachana or or uske kaaryon ke saath ek shrinkhalaa kii report kii: peedophilic purushon main kam buddhi hoti he smriti pareekshan main kam score, gaiyr baane haath ke logon kii adhik sankhya, skool grad main vifaltaa or uparokt aikyuu matbhed, kam shaareerik oonchai, bachapan main sir main choto ke kaaran behoshee kaa saamana karnaa padaa ho, or emarai mastishk sanrachanaon main kai matbhed

 While these results are relevant to prevent child abuse offenders from committing crimes again, there is no empirical suggestion of a cure to cure pedophilia
 Dr
 Fred Berlin, founder of the Sexual Disorder Clinic, Johns Hopkins, believes that pedophilia can be treated successfully if the medical community focuses more on it
 Castration, either physical or chemical, is quite effective in dissociating such sexual impulses when the attacker is driven by libido, which seems to be extremely effective in eliciting it, but this method is not recommended when drive is an expression of anger
 Or the need for power and control
 Chemical and surgical castration has been used in many European countries since World War II, although to a lesser extent, Nazi Germany was also employed to some extent

 haalanki, haalia samay main kanoonee rojgaar-aadhaarit apravasana prakriya main na bhare gayi padon kii sankhya itani adhik ho chuki he or yah prakriya itani adhik pichad gai he ki kuch vishisht deshon ke kushal vyavsaayik aavedakon ko apane green card praapt karne main kai varshon kaa samay lagata he
 Since there is no change in the duration of the H-1B visa, this means that as long as the green card applications of H-1B visa holders are in process, there will be an even greater number of h to remain in valid status
 1B visa holders have to renew their visa in one-year or three-years
 sanyukt rajya america main prativarsh jari kiye jane vaale ech-1bi visa kii sankhya congress ke aadesh se jari kiye jane vaale ek vaarshik cote par nirbhar hoti he

 Those beneficiaries who are currently holding H-1B status or who have held H-1B status at any time during the last six years, are not considered eligible for the annual quota
 This annual quota has a significant impact on the high-tech industry

 san 2000 main, congress ne vishvavidhyalayon or shaskeey anusandhan prayogshaalaon ko diye jane vaale ech-1bi visa ko kota se sthaayee rup se chhot pradaan kii
 During the early years of this quota, access to the number of this quota was really rare in the early 1990s
 haalanki 1990 ke dashak ke madhya tak aate-aate, yah kota prativarsh pehle aao-pehle paao ke aadhaar par bharaa jane laga, jiske parinamswaroop naye ech-1bi visa aavedan asweekrut yaa vilambit hone lage kyonki vaarshik kota pehle hi bhar jaaya karata tha
 In 1998, this quota was first increased to 115,000 and then in 2000, 195,000 visas per year
 jin varshon ke dauraan yah kota 195,000 tha, un varshon ke dauraan is sankhya tak kabhi nahin pahunchaa ja sakaa
 At the end of the temporary increase passed by the Congress in 1999, in FY 2004, the quota was again at 90,000
 tab se, yah kota punah bahut tivrata se prativarsh bharta ja rahaa he, jiske parinamswaroop ech-1bi visa praapt karnaa lagaataar kathin hota ja rahaa he
 In more recent times, the basic quota has been maintained at 65,000, but in addition the U

 vitt-varsh 2008 ke liye, atirikt 20,000 ucch oopaadhidhaariyon ke ech-1bi visa kaa kota 30 april ko puraa ho gaya
 In its annual report on H-1B visas released in November 2006, USCIS stated that it issued 131,000 H-1B visas in FY 2004 and 117,000 visas in FY 2005
 This reduction in data is because the H-1B visa may be exempted from the maximum limit if the employer is a university or a research laboratory
 vitt-varsh 2009 ke liye, yuassiaies ne 8 april 2008 ko ghoshnaa kii ki us varsh ke liye visa kaa puraa kota, 20,000 ucch oopaadhidhaariyon kaa kota or 65,000 kaa buniyadi kota donon, puure ho chuke hai
 USCIS will complete the initial data-entry of all applications received between April 1 and April 7, 2008, before the draw of the lottery
 vitt-varsh 2010 ke liye, yuassiaies ne 21 disambar 2009 ko ghoshnaa kii ki us varsh ke cote ko puraa karne ke liye paryaapt aavedan praapt ho chuke hai
 Trend analysis suggests that the FY 2011 ceiling will be attained sometime between early October and November as the economy picks up and the recession is easing

 Specialty tasks are defined as positions that require theoretical or technical expertise in a specialized field, and are generally interpreted as tasks that require at least a bachelor's degree Be necessary
 Typical H-1B tasks include architects, engineers, computer programmers, accountants, physicians, veterinarians, dentists, registered nurses, business managers, and college professors

 Another serious complaint to critics from the H-1B program is the reduction in pay: some studies have found that H-1B employees are paid significantly less than US employees

 Professor George J
 Harvard from the National Bureau of Economic Research
 a paper presented by Borjas found that "an immigration-induced 10 percent increase in the number of doctoral-educated people leads to a reduction in the salary of competitive employees by about 3 to 4 percent
" " It is expected that the LCA included in the H-1B petition should ensure that H-1B employees are paid according to the salary currently prevailing in the labor market, or the actual average salary of the employer, but evidence Employers do not follow these provisions and pay actual prevailing salary despite the provision of severe penalties for violators

 It has been reported in some recent news reports that the recession that began in 2008 will spoil the H1-B visa situation for both the program's supporters and those opposing it
 The process of obtaining a green card has been so long that during these years of recession it is not uncommon for sponsor companies to fail invisibly, causing H1-B workers to find another sponsor and queue up the green card Be forced to lose your place
 It is possible that an H1-B worker is only one month away from getting a green card, but if he is fired, he will have to leave the country or go to the end of the queue and start the process of getting a green card
 Depending on their nationality and visa category, they may have to wait for another 10 years
