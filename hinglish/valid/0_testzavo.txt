 "chhandas" is a synonym of Veda

 The word verse is also used in the same sense
 padya adhik vyapak arth main prayukt hota he
 In the language, words and words have letters and vowels
 inhen ko ek nishchit vidhaan se suvyavasthit karne par chand kaa naam diya jaataa he
 Chhandashastra is therefore considered to be a very strong scripture because it is based on mathematics
 vastut: dekhne par aisa prathit hota he ki chandashastra kii rachana isaliye kii gai jisase agrim santati iske niyamon ke aadhaar par chhandrachana kar sake
 It is also known from looking at the scriptures of the verses that while on the one hand the Acharya continued to develop the verses through the prasasti, on the other hand, the poets, while changing a few verses on their own behalf, created new verses, which in the texts of the verses of time, Incorporated
 chandashastra kii rachana kab hui, is sambandh main koi nishchit vichaar nahin diya ja saktaa
 Legend has it that Maharishi Valmiki is a primordial poet and his poetry called Ramayana is primordial
 maa nishad pratishtha tvan gam: shashwati samaa: yatkronchamithunadekamvadhi:, kammohitan - yah anushtup chand valmiki ke mukh se niklaa hua pratham chand he jo shok ke kaaran sahasaa shloke ke rup main prakat hua
 If this legend is to be believed, the verses were composed first and the verses came after that
 valmikiy ramayana main anushtup chand kaa prayog adyopant hua hi he, anya upjati aadi kaa bhi prayog prachur maatra main praapt hota he
 Another legend is that the original inventor of the scripture is God
 ek baar garud ne unhen pakad liya
 Sheshi said that we have a unique learning which you should learn, then eat us
 garud ne kaha ki aap bahaane banaate hai or swaraksharth hamen vibhramit kar rahe hai
 Sheshi replied that we do not make untrue speech
 isapar garud ne sweekaar kar liya or shesh unhen chandashastra kaa upadesh karne lage
 Describing the verses of various verses, at the end, the rest stated the rule of "bhujangaprayati", and soon entered the sea
 garud ne isapar kaha ki tumne hamen dhokhaa diya, shesh ne uttar diya ki hamane jane ke purv aapako soochna de di
 The quadrilateral form Bhujangaprayati means Bhujang Prayat verses from four ganas and is used
 is prakaar chandashastra kaa aavirbhaav hua
 It appears from this
 ki chandashastra ek daivi vidya ke rup main prakat hua
 Thus it can also be said that its inventor was Sheshacharya, named Sheshi, who does not have any special knowledge and information about it at this time
 iske pashchaat kaha jaataa he ki shesh ne avatar lekar pingalacharya ke rup main chandsutra kii rachana kii, jo pingalashastra kaha jaataa he
 This book is written in sutra style and is available till this time
 isapar tikaayen tathaa vyakhyaayein ho chuki hai
 This is considered to be the first book of the scriptures
 iske pashchaat is shaastra par sanskrit sahitya main anek granthon kii rachana hui
 The authors of the verses can be divided into two categories: the Acharya category, which gives a classical representation of the verses and the poet category, which presents separate works on the verses
 thode samay ke pashchaat ek lekhak shrenee or prakat hui jinamein aise lekhak aate hai jo chhandon ke niyamadikon kii vivechna apni ore se karte hai kintu udhaaharan duusare ke rache hue tathaa prachlit anshon se uddhrut karte hai
 In Hindi too, many texts have been written on Chhandasastra
 chandashastra main mukhya vivechy vishay do hai : There are mainly two types of verses: jinka prayong vedon main praapt hota he
 These include the four types of vowels, namely "anushtupa", such as Harsva, Long, Plut and Swarna
 vaidic chand apaurushey maane jate hai
 They are used under murder, but in fact the proverbial verses are those verses which are propagated in the general public or community
 ye chand kisi nishchit niyam par aadhaarit na hokar visheshat: taal or lay par hi aadhaarit rahete hai, isaliye inaki rachana saamaanya apathit jan bhi kar lete hai
 Cosmic verses refer to those verses that are composed on the basis of certain rules and which are used by well-versed poets in poetry
 in loukik chhandon ke rachana-vidhi-sambandhi niyam suvyavasthit rup se jis shaastra main rakhe gaye hai use chandashastra kehete hai
 The verses are divided on the basis of characters and quantities
 chand prathmat: do prakaar ke maane gaye he : varnik or maatrik
 The number of circles in these remains fixed
 iske do bhi prakaar hai- ganaatmak or aganaatmak
 The negative verses are also called circles
 inaki rachana teen laghu or deergh ganon se bane hue ganon ke aadhaar par hoti he
 If the arrangement of letters is arranged with the idea of short and long, eight forms are formed
 inhen ko "aath gana" kehete hai inamen bha, na, m, ya shubh gana maane gaye hai or ja, r, sa, t ashubh maane gaye hai
 The use of the first four ganas in the beginning of a sentence is appropriate, the use of the last four is prohibited
 yadi ashubh ganon se prarambh honevaale chand kaa hi prayog karnaa he, devatavachi yaa mangalvaachi varna athwa shabd kaa prayog pratham karnaa chahie - isse gandosh dur ho jaataa he
 These ganas are considered to be mutual friends, enemies and indifferent expressions
 chand ke aadi main do ganon kaa mail mana gaya he
 There is also a rule to consider the characters as short and long
 laghu swar athwa ek matraavaale varna laghu athwa hrasv maane gaye or isamen ek maatra maani gai he
 The short letter preceding the combined letters with long vowels is also considered as long and the letter with the discord and the letter of the verse are long
 aganaatmak varnik vrutt ve hai jinamein ganon kaa vichaar nahin rakhaa jaataa, keval varnon kii nishchit sankhya kaa vichaar rahata he vishesh maatrik chhandon main keval matraaon kaa hi nishchit vichaar rahata he or yah ek vishesh lay athwa gati par aadhaarit rahete hai
 Therefore these verses are rhythmic
 varnik chhandon main varna ganon ke hisaab se rakhe jate hai
 The group of three varnas is called gana
 in ganon ke naam hai: yagan, magan, tagan, ragan, jagan, bhagan, nagan or sagan
 Small alone is called 'L' and Guru is called 'C'
 kis gana main laghu-guru kaa kya kram he, yah jaanane ke liye nimnlikhit sutara sahaayak hota he- Seeing the character of the Gan, in this, add the next two letters together and apply the quantities of Gan in the same order, such as: matraaon main jo akeli maatra he, us ke aadhaar par inhen adilaghu yaa aadiguru kaha gaya he
 In which everyone is a Guru, he is called 'magan' Sarvaguru and all are short, 'nagan' is called Sarvalaghu
 sanskrit main adhiktar varnik chhando kaa hi gyaan karaayaa jaataa he; maatrik chhandon kaa kam
 In Sanskrit its name is 'dohadika' verses
 iske visham charnon main teraa-teraa or sam charnon main gyaarah-gyaarah matraayen hoti hai
 In odd feet etc
 
 There should not be this type of quantity-order and at the end there should be gurus and minor characters
 sam charnon kii tuk aapas main milani chahie
 like: is dohe ko pehali pankti main visham or sam donon charnon par matraachihn laga die hai
 Similarly, in the second line also you can put these signs on both the steps
 atah doha ek ardhasam maatrik chand he
 There are 28 quantities in each stage in Harigitika verses and at the end there should be mini and then Guru Varna
 isamen yeti 16 tathaa 12 matraaon ke baad hoti hai; jaise Each phase in this verse has twenty-six volumes and is followed by 14 and 12 quantities
 jaise: The division of verses is based on different numbers of phantoms of quantities and characters
 is prakaar chand sam, visham, ardhasam hote he
 In even stanzas, the varna varsha remains the same in all four phases of the stanza
 ardhasam main pratham, tritiy or dwitiya tathaa chaturth main varnaswar sankhya samaan rahati he
 The number of letters and vowels in all the four phases of the odd stanza remains uneven
 ye varna paraspar pruthak hote hai varnon or matraaon kii kuch nishchit sankhya ke pashchaat bahusankhyak varnon ou swaron se yukt chand dandak kahe jate he
 Their number is very high
 chando kaa vibhaajan phir anya prakaar se bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Independent verses and mixed verses
 swatantra chand ek hi chand vishesh niyam se rachaa hua rahata he
 There are two types of mixed verses: doha or rola ke milaane se dohe ke chaturth charan kii aavriti uske pratham charan ke aadi main kii jaati he or dohe ke praarambhik kuch shabd role ke ant main rakhe jate hai
 The second type of compound verse is "chappay" in which four stages are given by roll and two are given by Ullala
 isiliye ise shatpadi athwa chappay kaha jaataa he
 From his view, it is known that the development of verses is not only on the basis of prevalence but also on the basis of verses-mixing method by poets
 isi prakaar kuch chand kisi ek chand ke vilom rup ke bhav se aae hai jaise dohe kaa vilom soratha he
 It seems that poets have often made new verses by converting them into two verses or by increasing the volume in the same verse
 yah chand prastaar ke antargat aa saktaa he
 a phase of larger verses, except for short verses, when it cannot be read at once, determines the place where the composition stops
 is viramsthal ko yeti kehete hai
 With the idea of yeti, verses again become of two types - chand main sangeet tatv dwaara laalitya kaa puraa vichaar rakhaa gaya he
 Often all the verses become lyrical in one form or the other
 raag or raagini vaale sabhi pad chhandon main nahin kahe ja sakate
 That is why certain posts are composed under the name "geeti"
 praaia: sangitatmak padon main swar ke aaroh tathaa avaroh main bahudhaa laghu varna ko deergh, deergh ko laghu or alp laghu bhi kar liya jaataa he

 Hepatitis c is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis c virus HCV and affects the liver
 Its infection is often asymptomatic, but once it occurs, long-term infection can rapidly lead to liver damage and further damage that usually manifests after several years
 In some cases, some patients with cirrhosis may develop liver cancer or develop other complications of cirrhosis such as liver cancer and life-threatening esophageal varices and gastric varices

 An estimated 270–300 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C
 Hepatitis c is a completely human disease
 It cannot be obtained from any other animal nor given to them
 Chimpanzees can be infected with this virus in the laboratory, but they do not develop the disease, which has made the experiment more difficult
 There is no vaccine available for Hepatitis C
 The presence of hepatitis c "non-hepatitis") was assumed in the 1970s and finally proven in 1989
 It is one of five hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, E
 teevr hepatitis si echsivi ke saath hone vaale pehle 6 maheenon ke sankraman ko sanderbhit karata he

 Hepatitis c virus is usually detected in the blood approximately one to three weeks after infection by PCR and antibodies to the virus are usually detected between 3 to 15 weeks
 There is maximum variation in natural viral clearance rates, and 10–60% of people with HCV are able to isolate the virus from their bodies during the acute phase, as demonstrated by normalization of liver enzymes and aspartate transaminases) and plasma HCV-RNA clearance
 has gone 
 However, permanent infections are common and most patients develop long-term hepatitis c ie infection lasting longer than 6 months

 Recent data suggest that roughly one-third of untreated patients develop liver cirrhosis in at least 20 years
 In the other one-third of people, cirrhosis develops within 30 years
 The rest of the patients develop so slowly that there is no risk of cirrhosis in their life
 In contrast, the NIH unanimous guideline states that the risk of developing cirrhosis is 3–20 percent over a period of 20 years

 Symptoms of liver disease are usually absent especially until the liver is actually harmed
 However, hepatitis c is a somatic disease and patients may notice a wide difference in clinical performance from the absence of symptoms to the onset of a serious illness
 Pervasive symptoms associated with chronic hepatitis c include fatigue, flu-like symptoms, lump pain, itching, nightmares, loss of appetite, nausea, and depression

 Liver enzyme tests show different elevations of ALT and AST
 From time to time, they can also show normal results
 The results of prothrombin and albumin are usually normal but may be abnormal once cirrhosis occurs
 Elevation levels of liver tests do not coincide with liver damage on biopsy
 Viral genotype and viral load also do not coincide with liver injury
 Liver biopsy is the best test to accurately determine damage and inflammation
 Radiographic studies such as ultrasound or CT scan do not show liver damage if not advanced enough
 However, non-invasive tests such as the fibro test and actitest are coming up to assess liver fibrosis and necrotico-inflammation, respectively
 These tests have been confirmed and have been recommended in Europe

 Although injecting drug use is the most common route of HCV infection, any action or activity or condition in which there is a possibility of blood-to-blood contact may be a potential source of HCV infection
 The virus can be transmitted through sexual contact, but it is rare and usually occurs only when an STD causes lesions to open and hemorrhage and increases the likelihood of more blood contact

 Currently, people who have used or used injections for drugs have an increased risk of Hepatitis C
 It is believed that these people may have used shared needles or other drug paraphernalia, which could be contaminated by hcv-infected blood
 It is estimated that 60% to 80% of intravenous recreational drug users in the United States are suspected to be infected with HCV
 Harm reduction strategies to prevent the spread of Hepatitis c in many countries encouraged education, provision of clean and safe needles and syringes, and safe injection techniques
 Currently the United States has seen a decline in broadcasting through this route, the reasons for which are not yet clear

 People may be exposed to HCV through inadequate or improper medical or dental equipment
 Improperly disinfected devices can carry contaminated blood including needles or syringes, hemodialysis equipment, oral hygiene equipment, and jet air guns
 The risk of HCV iatrogenic can be reduced to zero by diligently using appropriate techniques of punctuality and sterilization and destroying the equipment used

 If proper sterilization techniques are not followed, HCV infected blood can be transmitted from person to person even when tattooing, dyes, stilts, and piercing tools
 Tackling or piercing "underground" or non-professionally before the mid-1980s is of concern because sterile techniques may be inadequate in such settings to prevent the spread of disease; The use of shared tattooing devices increases the risk of HCV exposure
 In fact, this was the reason Pamela Anderson officially had to say: "I shared hepatitis c with my ex-husband Tommy Lee using a single needle for a shared tattoo
" Tommy had the disease and he never told me about it during our marriage
 "the U
S
 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on the subject, "transmission of hepatitis c and other infectious diseases is possible if tattoos are made or body pierced by informal centers or infected equipment
" Despite these risks, HCV infection is difficult to get tattooed in approved facilities

 The anti-hcv virus indicates a risk, but it is not known whether the infection is present
 All people who have been found to have positive anti-hcv should undergo additional testing for the presence of Hepatitis c virus to find out if there is currently an infection
 Polymerase chain reaction PCR, transcription mediated amplification TMA or branched DNA were tested to detect the presence of viruses and the use of molecular nucleic acid testing methods
 All HCV nucleic acid molecular tests not only have the ability to detect whether a virus is present but also have the ability to measure the amount of virus present in the blood viral load)

 Hepatitis c virus causes chronic infection in 50% to 80% of infected persons
 About 50% of these do not respond during treatment
 Long-term HCV carriers have little chance of eradicating the virus
 However, in most patients with chronic hepatitis C, it will not end without treatment

 It is estimated that around 200 million people worldwide are infected with Hepatitis c and more than 3-4 million people are infected with it every year
 There are approximately 35,000 to 185,000 new cases a year in the United States
 It is currently the major cause of cirrhosis and a common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma
 As a result, it has become the leading cause of liver transplantation in the US
 Co-infection of HIV is common in HIV positive population and the rate is also high
 There are 10,000–20,000 deaths from HCV in the United States every year
 This death rate is expected to increase as the number of those who got infected due to transfusion before HCV testing became clear

 The main reason for this is that both viruses are blood borne and exist in the same population
 HCV is the main cause of chronic liver disease in the United States
 Clinical studies have shown that HIV infection is rapidly causing chronic hepatitis c to cirrhosis and liver failure
 It cannot be said that treatment is not an option for people living with co-infection

 In the mid-1970s, Harvey J
, head of the infectious diseases department at the blood transfusion department of the National Institutes of Health
 Alter and his research group proved through their research that most of the post-transfusion hepatitis cases were not caused by hepatitis a or b viruses
 Despite this discovery, international research efforts to identify a virus initially called non-a, non-b hepatitis NAABH failed for the next century
 In 1987, Michael Huffton, qui-lim Chu, and George Quo teamed with Dr
 DW Bradley of the CDC at Chiron Corporation to use molecular cloning to identify unknown organisms
 In 1988, Alter confirmed the presence of the virus in view of its presence in a panel of samples of AANBH
 After the discovery of the virus in April 1989, its new name, Hepatitis c virus, was published in two articles in the journal HCV Science

 Viramidine is an alternative drug in place of ribavirin, which benefits the liver and may be more effective against hepatitis c when given the prescribed dose, which is currently in Phase III of the experimental trial
 It will be used in combination with interferon, as used for ribavirin
 However, this drug is not expected to be effective in strains resistant to ribavirin, which had not previously been used and failed in ribavirin / interferon treatment at the time of infection

 pi shriramakrishnan vartmaan kerala vidhaan sabha ke adhyaksh hai | Open economy is a philosophy of economy
 khuli arthvyavastha ko agar uske shabdic arth se samajhen to iskaa matlab hota he ek aisa desh yaa samaaj jahaan kisi ko kisi se bhi vyapaar karne kii chhot hoti he or aisa bhi nahi ki is vyapaar pe koi sarkari ankush yaa niyantran nahi hota
 But the government makes such policies so that common people can easily start industries and other types of business
 aisi arthvyavastha me vyapaaron ko swatantra rup se phalne-phoolne diya jaataa he
 Government controls are made in such a way that the businesses are prevented from any kind of dishonesty, but the control is not tightened so much that there is inconvenience in the honest business
 khuli arthvyavastha na keval us samaaj ya desh ke andruni vyapaar ke liye hoti he balki bahari vyapaar ko bhi usee drushti se dekha jaataa he
 The idea of open economy is not new in India
 itihaas ko dhyaan se padhane pe pataa he ki aadi kaal se bharat me vyapaar ke liye khuli arthvyavastha kii niti thi
 During the time of Chandragupta Maurya, trade in India came from China and from Europe
 resham maarg antatrashtriya vyapaar me bharat ke yogdan kaa ek udhaaharan he
 During the time of Chandragupta Maurya and Emperor Ashoka, wood was traded
 akbar se samay main bharat me vyapaar kaaphi faltaa-phulataa tha
 The British also came to do business in India
 matlab 1700-1800 me bhi bharat me videshi mul ke vyapaariyon se vyapaar hota tha
 Probably, with the East India Company becoming part of businessmen, there was a belief in Indian society that trade was not supported by more leaders when India became independent in 1947
 bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri pan nehru roosi samaajwaad se kaaphi prabhavit the
 After independence, Nehru tried to establish socialism in India
 shaayad ye bharat kii arthvyavastha ke kshetra me sabase badi bhul thi
 India did not have an open economy from 1947 to 1990
 bharat ne aayaat or niryaat pe kayi tarah ke kar lagaaye jate the
 Due to taxes on exports, the Indian industry did not find cheap goods sold here in the international market
 antar-rashtreey bazaar kii pratispardhaa me bhartiya udyogon ke naa tik paane se bharat peeche rah gaya
 During this time, countries like Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan made their way into the international market
 bharat me aayaat par bhi kaaphi kar lagaaye jate the
 For this reason, foreign industries used to have difficulty in selling their goods in India
 videshon bane samaan bharat me bahut mahange hone kii vajah se bharat me zyaada log kharid nahi pate the
 Those who were born outside of India could not easily reach the people of India
 isse ek taraf to bharat ke naagarik 1947 se 1980'za tak computer, aadhunik ghadiyon, aadhunik telephone, kaaron, ityadi se vanchit rah gayi to duusari taraf bhartiya udyogon ko zaruri takniken nahi mil payi
 Due to non-production of products through international and technical methods, many of India's industries like textiles, agriculture, aviation, manufacturing, etc
 were lagging behind international standards
 bharat kaa growth rate kareeb 3
0% rah gaya or ise vishwa me hindu growth rate se janaa jane laga
 Due to the non-development of India's industries, all the people of India remained below the poverty line
 is dauraan bharat ke moolbhoot dhaanche kaa bahut dhimi gati se vikaas hua
 India's electricity, water, roads, information system, etc
 have been deteriorating
 mudrasphiti kii dar bahut zyaada hone se mahangaai kaphi badhti chali gayi par udyogon kii biimaar haalat ke chalate logo kii aamadani mudrasphiti dar ke baraabar na batch saki
 The problem of balance of payment started in India from 1985
 1991 me chandrasekhar sarkaar ke shashan ke dauraan bharat me belans ouf pement kii samasya ne vikaraal rup dhaaran kiya or bharat kii pehle se charmaraayi hui arthvyavastha ghutno pe aa gayi
 Foreign exchange reserves in India remained at par for only three weeks of imports
 ye ek bahut hi gambheer samasya thi
 During this time the problem had become so serious that India had exhausted the necessary funds to run the country
 bharat sarkaar ne apane swarna bhandar se sona bank off england ke paas girvee rakhane kii taiyaariyaan shuru kar di thi
 The Indian government led by Narsimha Rao decided to undertake large-scale economic reforms in India
 udaarikaran kahlane vaale in sudhaaro ke architect the manmohan singh
 In the coming times, Manmohan Singh started to change India's economy completely
 ye voh samay tha jabaki bharat ne apni arthvyavastha ko khulaa karne kii shuruyaat kii
 The economic reforms done since 1990, from the perspective of most people, gave India the status of a strong economic country in the world
 1990 se 1996 tak manmohan singh bharat ke vitt mantri the

 iske baad 2004 me aadhunik bharat kii arthniti ke rachayita manmohan singh bharat ke pradhanmantri bane or pi chidambram vitt mantri
 In all these years, India grew very fast

 Freedom is the biggest benefit of open economy
 azaadi mukt rup se vyapaar karne kii, unnati karne kii, paisa kamaane kii
 Since the open economy basically promotes industries and trade, in such a society, citizens have many options to purchase the same product
 aise me har udyog pe apane utpaadon ko or behtar or sasta banane kaa ek prakruthik dabaav hota he
 This industry uses new technology
 jisse utpaadon kii gunvattta behtar hoti he
 Since industries are encouraged in such an economy, more and more shops and offices are opened
 isse logon ko zyaada rozgaar ke saadhan milte he
 Everyone enjoys the competition in the market
 naye utpaada banate he
 The quality of old products improves
 logon ko rozgaar milta he
 This also increases competition due to increasing demand of workers in industries
 or sabhi udyog apane karmchariyon ko zyaada tankhwaah de ke virdohi company me jane se rokte he
 Due to this, the purchasing power of people increases
 logo ke paas zyaada paisa aane se unka rahan sahan behtar hota he
 They can live in a big house
 apane bacchon ko behtar skool bhej sakate he or apni paariwarik or saamaajik zimmevaariyon kaa beharti se vahan kar sakate he
 In the open economy, government controls less than many things
 isko nijeekaran bhi kahte he
 Maslan is now widely seen by banks and other financial institutions
 jab koi vittiya santhaan kisi udyog main puunji nivesh karta he to voh ye dekhne ko baadhya hota he ki yah udyog thik se kaam kare
 The financial institution also observes that the industry should not do anything that has some kind of legal problem on it
 khuli arthvyavastha me bazaar swatah hi aise kaam karta he jisaki kii logon ko zarurat he
 If there is a product or service that people need, then the old industrialist or some new entrepreneur starts sending that type of product or service to the people
 aakhir isme utpaadak or utbhogta - dono kaa hi fayda he
 If a product or service is something that people no longer need, then it gradually stops
 agar log kharidene nahi to company ko ghaataa hoga or vah yaa to apana utpaada vakt ke saath badalegi yaa use bananaa band kar degi
 New technologies are developed by the open economy
 bazaar me hone vaali pratispardhaa udyogo ko nayi takneekon ke vikaas ko baadhya karti he
 Since 1990, a lot of industries have grown rapidly in India
 adhikansh logon ke najariye se 1990 se ab tak kiye gayi aarthik sudhaaron ne hi bharat ko duniya main ek shashakt aarthik desh kaa darza dilaayaa

 In the early years of the nineteenth century, Buchanan visited the palace hills
 uske varnan ke anusaar ye pahadiyaan abhedya lagati thim
 This was a dangerous area where very few travelers dared to go
 bukanan jahaan kahin bhi gaya, vahaan usne nivaasiyon ke vyavhaar ko shatrutapurna paaya
 They were apprehensive about the company executives and were not willing to talk to them
 kai udaahranon main to ve apane ghar-baar or gaanv chhodkar bhaag gaye the
 Who are these mountain people? Why was he so suspicious of Buchanan's visit? In Buchanan's magazine we get a glimpse of the pity that these people had in the early years of the nineteenth century
 un sthanon ke bare main usne diary likhi thi, jahaan-jahaan usne bhraman kiya tha, logon se mulaakaat kii thi or unke reeti-rivaajon ko dekha tha
 Looking at the revenue records of the later decades of the eighteenth century, one can understand why these hill people were called 'pahadiya'
 ve rajmahal kii pahadiyon ke ird-gird rahaa karte the
 They used to live with the forest produce and did jhum farming
 ve jangal ke chote-se hisse main jhaadiyon ko katkar or ghaas-foons ko jalaakar jameen saaf kar lete the aarai raakh kii potash se upjaai bani jameen par ye pahadiya log apane khaane ke liye tarah-tarah kii daalen or jowar-bajra uga lete the
 They used to scrape the land a little with their hoe and used to cultivate the cleaned land for a few years, then leave it fallow for a few years and move to a new area so that the lost fertility in that land is again generated
 Used to go
 un jangalon se pahadiya log khaane ke liye mahua ke phul ikattha karte the, bechney ke liye resham ke koya or raal or kathkoyala banane ke liye lakadiyaan ikattha karte the
 The small plants that grew under the trees or the green sheets of grass-straw that were spread on the fallow ground became pastures for animals
 shikariyon, jhum kheti karne waalon, khaadya batorne waalon, kathkoyala banane waalon, resham ke keede paalane waalon ke rup main pahadiya logon kii zindagi is prakaar jangal se ghanishtha rup se judi hui thi
 They lived in their huts amidst tamarind trees and rested in the shade of mango trees
 ve puure pradesh ko apni nijee bhoomi maanate the or yah bhoomi unki pahchaan or jivan kaa aadhaar thi
 They resist the entry of outsiders
 unke mukhiya log apane samooh main ekta banaae rakhte the, aapasi ladaai-jhagade nipta dete the or anya janajatiyon tathaa maidani logon ke saath ladaai chhidane par apni janajati kaa netritv karte the
 By making these hills their base, the hill people used to attack the plains where the farmers settled and did their farming in one place
 pahadiyon dwaara ye akraman zyaadaatar apane aapako vishesh rup se abhaav yaa akaal ke varshon main jivit rakhane ke liye kiye jate the
 At the same time, this attack was also a way to show its strength to the inhabited communities in the plains
 iske alaava, aise akraman bahari logon ke saath apane raajnneetik sambandho banane ke liye bhi kiye jate the
 The zamindars living in the plains often had to lathe these hill heads regularly and buy peace from them
 isi prakaar, vyapaaree log bhi in pahadiyon dwaara niyantrit raaston kaa istemaal karne kii anumati praapt karne hetu unhen kuch pathakar diya karte the
 When such tolling hill heads were found, they used to protect the traders and also assured that no one would rob their goods
 is prakaar kuch le-dekar kii gai shanti sandhi adhik lambey samay tak nahin chali
 It was disbanded in the last decades of the eighteenth century when the boundaries of the area of stable cultivation began to be aggressively extended to eastern India
 angrejon ne jangalon kii kataai-safaai ke kaam ko protsaahit kiya or jameendaaron tathaa jotdaaron ne parati bhoomi ko dhan ke kheton main badal diya
 The expansion of permanent agriculture was necessary for the British because it could increase the sources of revenue, create crops for export and establish a stable, well-organized society
 ve jangalon ko ujaad maanate the or vanavaasiyon ko asabhy, barbar, updravi or krur samajhate the jin par shashan karnaa unke liye kathin tha
 So they realized that by clearing the forests, they would have to set up a permanent farm there and domesticate and civilize the wild people and get rid of hunting and persuade them to take up farming
 jyon-jyon sthaayee kashi kaa vistaar hota gaya, jangalon tathaa charaagahon kaa kshetra sankuchit hota gaya
 This intensified a quarrel between the hill people and the permanent cultivators
 pahari log pehle se adhik niyamit rup se based hue gaanvon par hamale bolne lage or gramvaasiyon se anaaj or pashu chin-jhapat kar le jane lage
 The colonial authorities were excited and tried their best to control these hills but it was not easy for them to do so
 1770 ke dashak main british adhikariyon ne in pahadiyon ko nirmul kar dene kii krur niti apana lee or unka shikaar or sanhaar karne lage
 Subsequently, in the 1780s, Augustus Cleveland, the collector of Bhagalpur, proposed a policy of peace-keeping according to which the hill chiefs were to be given an annual allowance and in return they had to take the responsibility of keeping their men well
 unase yah bhi aashaa kii gai thi ki ve apni bastiyon main vyavastha banaae rakhenge or apane logon ko anushaasan main rakhenge
 But many Pahariya chiefs refused to accept the allowance
 jinhone ise sweekaar kiya unamem se adhikansh apane samudaay main apni satta kho baithe
 With the colonial government becoming salaried, they came to be considered as subordinate employees or paid heads
 jab shanti sthapana ke liye abhiyaan chal rahe the tabhi pahadiya log apane aapako shatrutapurna sanyabalon se bachaane ke liye or bahari logon se ladaai chaalu rakhane ke liye pahaado ke bhitari bhaagon main chale gaye
 So when Buchanan visited the region in the winter of 1810–11, it was only natural that the Paharians would look at Buchanan with suspicion and mistrust
 shanti sthapana ke abhiyaanon ke anubhav or krurtapurna daman kii yaadon ke kaaran unke man main yah dharna ban gai thi ki unke ilaako british logo kii ghuspaith kaa kya asar hone vaala he unhe aise prathit hota tha ki prayek gora aadmi ek aisi shakti kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahaa he jo unase unke jangal or jameen chin kar unki jivan style or jivit rahane ke sadhano ko nasht karne par utaaru hai
 In fact, these days he was getting information about a new threat and that was the arrival of Santhal people
 santhal log vahaan ke jangalon kaa safaaya karte hue, imarti lakdi ko katate hue, jameen jotate hue or chaaval tathaa kapaas ugaate hue us ilaako main badi sankhya main ghuse chale aa rahe the
 As the Santhal settlers had taken possession of the lower hills, the hills had to retreat to the palace hills and inward
 pahadiya log apni jhum kheti ke liye kudaal kaa prayog karte the isliye yadi kudaal ko pahadiya jivan kaa pratik mana jaae to hal ko nae bashindon ;santhalon kii shakti kaa pratinidhi maananaa hoga
 This fight between Hull and Kudal lasted for a long time
 san 1810 ke ant main, bukanan ne ganjuriya pahaad, jo ki rajmahal shrankhlaon kaa ek bhaag tha, ko paar kiya or aage ke chattani pradesh ke bich se nikalakar vah ek gaanv main pahunch gaya
 Although it was an old village, the land around it had just been cleared for farming
 vahaan ke bhudashya kaa dekhakar use pataa chalaa ki ‘maanav shram ke samuchit prayog se’ us kshetra kii to kaaya hi palat gai he
 He wrote, "enough plowing has been done in Ganjuria, which shows how many magnificent areas can be changed
 i think, its beauty and prosperity can be developed like any region of the world
" yahan kii jameen alabatta chattani he lekin bahut hi zyada badhiya he or bukanan ne utani badhiya tambaakoo or sarson or kahin nahin dekhin
 On inquiring, he came to know that the Santhals had increased the boundaries of the agricultural area considerably
 ve is ilaake main 1800 ke aas-paas aae the unhane vahaan rahane vaale pahari logon ko neeche ke dhaalon par bhaga diya, jangalon kaa safaya kiya aarai fir vahaan bas gaye
 The Santhals started coming to Bengal around the 1780s
 jameendaar log kheti ke liye nayi bhoomi taiyaar karne or kheti kaa vistaar karne ke liye unhen bhaade par rakhte the or british adhikariyon ne unhen jangal mahalon main basane kaa nimantran diya
 When the British failed to settle the hills in one place for their permanent agriculture, their attention went towards the Santhals
 pahadiya log jangal kaatane ke liye hal ko haath lagane ko taiyaar nahin the or ab bhi updravi vyavhaar karte the
 Whereas, on the contrary, Santhals appeared to be ideal residents, as they had no hesitation in clearing the forests and plowing the land with full force
 santhalon ko jaminen dekar rajmahal kii talahati main basane ke liye taiyaar kar liya gaya
 By 1832, a large tract of land was demarcated as damin-i-koh
 ise santhalon kii bhoomi ghoshit kar diya gaya
 They had to live within the area, plow by plowing and become permanent farmers
 santhalon ko di jane vaali bhoomi ke anudaan-patr main yah shart thi ki unako di gai bhoomi ke kam-se-kam dasven bhaag ko saafe karke pehle das varshon ke bheetar jotna tha
 The entire area was surveyed and its map drawn
 iske chaaron ore khambe gaadkar isaki parisima nirdhaarit kar di gai or ise maidani ilaake ke sthaayee kashkon kii duniya se or pahadiya logon kii pahadiyon se alag kar diya gaya
 After the demarcation of damin-i-koh, the settlements of the Santhals grew rapidly, the number of Santhal villages which were 40 in 1838 rapidly increased to 1,473 by 1851
 isi avadh main, santhalon kii jansankhya jo keval 3,000 thi, badhkar 82,000 se bhi adhik ho gai
 As the cultivation expanded, so did the revenue amount of the company's vault
 unnisvin shatabdi ke santhal geeton or mithkon main unki yatra ke lambey itihaas kaa baar-baar ullekh kiya gaya he: unamem kaha gaya he ki santhal log apane liye basane yogya sthaan kii khoj main baraabar bina thake chalate hi rahete the
 Now coming here in damin-i-koh, as if his journey had come to a complete halt
 jab santhal rajmahal kii pahadiyon par based to pehle pahadiya logon ne iskaa pratirodh kiya par antatogatva ve in pahadiyon main bheetar kii ore chale jane ke liye majaboor kar die gaye
 They were prevented from coming downstream into the lower hills and valleys and confined to the rocky and more barren areas of the Ei Pari hills and the inner dry parts
 isse unke rahan-sahan tathaa jivan par bura prabhaav padaa or aage chalakar ve garib ho gaye
 Jhoom farming depends on the ability to find new lands and utilize natural fertility of the land
 ab sarvaadhik urvar jaminen unke liye durlabh ho gayi kyonki ve ab damin kaa hissaa ban chuki thim
 Therefore, the Pahadia people could not carry on their farming methods; Jhoom farming successfully
 jab is kshetra ke jangal kheti ke liye saafe kar die gaye to pahadiya shikariyon ko bhi samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In contrast, the Santhal people had abandoned their previous nomadic lives
 ab ve ek jagah bas gaye the or bazaar ke liye kai tarah ke vanijyik fasalon kii kheti karne lage the or vyapaariyon tathaa sahukaaron ke saath len-dein karne lage the
 However, the Santhals soon realized that the land they had started cultivating was getting out of their hands
 santhalon ne jis jameen ko saafe karke kheti shuru kii thi us par sarkaar ;rajya baari kar laga rahi thi, sahuukaar ;diku log bahut oonchi dar par byaaj laga rahe the or karj adaa na kiye jane kii surat main jameen par hi kabja kar rahe the or jameendaar log damin ilaake par apane niyantran kaa daawa kar rahe the
 By the 1850s, the Santhals had begun to realize that the time had come to revolt against landlords, moneylenders and colonial rule, to create an ideal world for themselves, where they ruled
 1855-56 ke santhal vidroh ke baad santhal pargane kaa nirmaan kar diya gaya, jiske liye 5,500 vargamil kaa kshetra bhagalpur or birbhum jilon main se liya gaya
 The colonial Raj hoped that the Santhal people would be satisfied by creating a new pargana for the Santhals and implementing some special laws in it
 vah british east india company kaa ek karmchaaree tha
 His travels were not inspired only by his love of landscapes and the discovery of the unknown
 vah nakshaa navison, surveykshakon, palki uthaane waalon kuliyon aadi ke bade dal ke saath sarvatra yatra karata tha
 His trips were borne by the East India Company because he needed the information that Buchanan anticipated
 bukanan ko yah saafe-saafe hidaayat di jaati thi ki use kya dekhnaa, khojna or likhnaa he
 Whenever he came to a village with an army of his people, he was immediately seen as an agent of the government
 jab company ne apni shakti ko sudrudh bana liya or apane vyavsaay kaa vikaas kar liya to vah un practik sadhano kii khoj main jute gai jin par kabja karke unka manachaaha upyog kar sakati thi
 He surveyed landscapes and revenue sources, conducted search trips and sent his geologists, geographers, botanists and physicians to gather information
 nihsandeh asaadhaaran prekshan shakti kaa bukanan aisa hi ek vyakti tha
 Wherever Buchanan went, he looked carefully at the different levels and layers of stones and rocks and land there

 duusare punik yuddh ke dauraan hui jab roman senaaon ne general marcus cloudius marcelas ke netritv main do saal kii gheraabandi ke baad seracus shahar par kabza kar liya
 According to the popular description given by Plutarch, Archimedes was considering a mathematical figure when the city was captured
 ek roman sainik ne unhen aakar general marcelas se milane kaa aadesh diya, lekin unhone yah kahkar inkaar kar diya ki unhen apni samasya par kaam puraa karnaa he
 This angered the soldier and killed Archimedes with his sword
 plutark archimedes kii mrityu kaa bhi ek vivaran dete hai lesser-known jisamen yah kaha gaya he ki sambhavatya unhen tab maar diya gaya jab ve ek roman sainik ko samarpan karne kaa prayaas kar rahe the
 According to this story, Archimedes was carrying a mathematical device and was killed because the soldier thought it was valuable
 kaha jaataa he ki archimedes kii mrityu se general marcelas bahut krodhit hue, kyonki ve unhen ek amuly vaigyanik sampati maanate the or unhone aadesh die the ki archimedes ko kisi bhi prakaar kaa nuksaan nahin pahunchaaya janaa chahie
 Archimedes' last words were believed to be, "do not disturb my circles", the accounts here refer to the circles of the mathematical picture that Archimedes was studying when the Roman soldier harassed him

 75 BC In, 137 years after his death, the Roman speaker Cicero was serving as treasurer in Sicily
 unhone archimedes ke makbare ke bare main kahaniyaan suni thim, lekin sthaneey logon main se koi bhi isaki sthiti bataane main sakasham nahin tha
 He eventually discovered this mausoleum near the Agrigentine Gate in Syracuse, it was in a very neglected condition and there were many shrubs growing on it
 siciro ne makbare ko saafe kiya or iske upar hui nakkashi ko dekh paae or us par shilaalekh ke rup main upasthit kuch chhandon ko padhaa
 Standard versions of Archimedes's life were written by historians of ancient Rome long after his death

 archimedes ke bare main sabase vyapak rup se gyaat tathy yah bataata he ki kis prakaar se unhone ek aniyamit akruti ke ek vastu ke aaytan ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye vidhi kii khoj kii
 According to Vitruvius, a new crown of a laurel wreath was made for King Hero II and Archimedes was asked to find out whether the crown was made of pure gold or that the unscrupulous goldsmith had added silver to it
 archimedes ko mukut ko nuksaan pahunchaae bina is samasya kaa samaadhaan karnaa tha, isliye vah iske ghanatv kii gananaa karne ke liye ise pighla kar ek niyamit aakaar kii vastu main nahin badal saktaa tha
 While taking a bath, he noticed that when he went inside the tub, the water level in the tub rose and he realized that this effect could be used to determine the volume of the crown
 vyavhaarik prayojanon ke liye pani ko sampidit nahin kiya ja saktaa he, isliye duba hua mukut apane aaytan kii baraabar maatra ke pani ko pratisthapit karegaa
 The density of the crown can be obtained by dividing the weight of the crown by the volume of water replaced
 yadi isamen saste or kam ghanatv vaale dhaatu milaaye gaye hai to iskaa ghanatv sone se kam hoga
 What was then, Archimedes became so excited by his discovery that he forgot to wear clothes and ran in the streets in a naked state shouting "eureka!" sone ke mukut kii kahani archimedes ke gyaat kaaryon main prakat nahin hoti he
 Furthermore, due to the excessive amount of accuracy required in the measurement of water displacement, the feasibility of the method described by it has been questioned
 sambhavat: archimedes ne ek aisa hal diya jo jalsthitiki main archimedes ke siddhant naamak siddhant par lagu hota he, jise ve apane ek granth on floating bodis main varnit karte hai
 According to this theory, an object immersed in a liquid exerts a buoyancy force that is equal to the weight of the liquid it removes
 is siddhant kaa prayog karte hue, sone ke mukut ke ghanatv kii tulana thos sone se karnaa sambhav ho gaya hoga, iske liye pehle mukut ko sone ke ek namoonay ke saath ek paimaane par santulit kiya gaya hoga, phir tantra ko pani main dubaaya gaya hoga
 If the crown was less dense than gold, it would have replaced more water due to its greater volume and thus the buoyancy force applied to it would have been greater than the sample
 utplavakta main yah antar paimaane par dikhaayi diya hoga
 Galileo considered that "archimedes may have used this method, since, to be very precise, it is based on the performance given by Archimedes himself
" " a large part of the work by Archimedes in the field of engineering came from meeting the needs of his own city of Syracuse
 unani lekhak naukratis ke athenus ne varnit kiya ki kaise raja hiron II ne archimedes ko ek vishaal jahaaj, syracusia dizin karne ke liye kaha, jise vilasitapurna yatra karne ke liye, saamaan kii supplai karne ke liye or nausena ke yudhpot ke rup main prayukt kiya ja sake
 Siracusia is believed to have been the largest ship in ancient times

 archimedes ke scru kaa upyog aaj bhi drav or kaneey thos jaise koyala or anaaj ko pump karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Archimedes' screw described by Vitruvius in Roman times was probably an improvement on the screw pump that was used to irrigate the hanging gardens of the Babylonians
 archimedes kaa panja ek hathiyaar he, mana jaataa he ki unhone seracus shahar kii raksha ke liye ise dizin kiya tha
 Also known as "the Ship Shaker", this claw had a crane-like arm from which a large metal hook hung
 jab is panje ko ek akraman karte hue jahaaj par daalaa jaataa tha, bhujaa upar kii ore uthati thi or jahaaj ko ko uthaakar pani se baahar nikaalati thi or sambhawatah ise duba detii thi
 Modern tests have been conducted to investigate the feasibility of this claw, and in 2005 a television documentary titled Super Weapons of the Ancient World created a version of this claw and concluded that it was a working device

 It has been suggested that a large group of layers of heavily polished bronze or copper serve as mirrors, presumably which were used to focus sunlight onto the ship
 isamen paravalay paravarti ke siddhant kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha, jaise saura bhatti main kiya jaataa he
 a trial of Archimedes heat ray was carried out in 1973 by the Greek scientist Lonis Sakkas
 yah prayog athens ke baahar skaramjes nausena base par kiya gaya
 At this time 70 mirrors were used, each was polished with a copper and its size was about 5x3 feet
 The mirrors were placed in the direction of a plywood mock-up of a Roman warship about 160 feet away
 jab darpanon ko thik prakaar se focus kiya gaya, jahaaj kuch hi kshanon main aag kii lapaton main jalane laga
 The plywood was polished with tar paint on the ship, which further contributed to the combustion

 It was also pointed out that because Syracuse is facing the sun to the east, the Roman fleet would have to attack in the morning to collect favorable light from the mirrors
 mithbsters ne yah bhi kaha ki paaramparik hathiyaar, jaise jwalanth tir yaa ek gulel se bheje gaye tir, kam duuri se jahaaj ko jalane kaa adhik aasaan tarika he
 While Archimedes did not discover the lever, he first gave a rigorous description of the theory involved

 Archimedes has also been credited with improving the ability and accuracy of the catapult and invented the odometer during the First Punic War
 odometer ko ek gear se yukt ek gaadi kii pranali ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he, jo har ek mile chalane ke baad ek gend ko ek paatr main daalati he
 Cicero briefly mentions Archimedes in his Dialogue de Rey Publica, in 129 BC after the siege of Syracuse
 a fictional conversation depicted in, c
 212 BC, General Marcus Claudius Marcellus is said to have brought back two systems in Rome, which were used to aid astronomy, the Sun, Moon and the Five Shows the motion of the planets
 siciro usee tarah kii pranali kaa ullekh karte hai jaisi pranali militus ke thels or needs ke yudoxs ke dwaara dizin kii gayi
 According to this dialogue, Marcellus kept one device as his personal loot from Syracuse and donated all the others to the Temple of Virtue in Rome
 siciro ke anusaar marcelas kii pranali ko geiyas salpikas gelis ke dwaara lukias furias philis ko darshaya gaya, jisane ise is prakaar se varnit kiya: It is a description of a planetarium or Orei)
 alegsendriya ke pappas ne kaha ki archimedes ne in nirdisht pranaaliyon ke nirmaan par ek pandulipi likhi he On sphere-making
 Modern studies in this area focus on the antikythera system, another device from ancient times that was probably designed for a similar purpose
 is prakaar kii nirmaanatmak pranali ke liye avakal gearing ke parishkrut gyaan kii aavashyaktaa rahi hogi
 It was once thought to be outside the range of technology available in ancient times, but the discovery of the Antikythera system in 1902 ensured that such devices were known to the ancient Greeks

 yah takanic purnataa kii vidhi kehalaati he or unhone iskaa prayog pai ) ke sannikat maan kaa pataa lagane main kiya
 For this he painted a large polygon outside a vow and a small polygon inside the vow
 jaise jaise bahubhuj kii bhujaaon kii sankhya badhati he, vrath kaa sanniktan adhik sateek ho jaataa he
 When each polygon had 96 sides, they calculated the lengths of their sides and showed that the value of π was between 31⁄7 and 310⁄71, corresponding to its true value of about 3
1416
 unhone yah bhi pramanit kiya ki vraton kaa kshetrafal π or vrath kii trigya ke varg ke gunanfal ke baraabar tha
 In measuring a vow, Archimedes states the square root value of 3 to be greater than 265⁄153 and less than 1351⁄780

 In The Sand Reconnor, Archimedes gave a set of numbers to calculate the number of soil particles present in this universe
 aisa karne main, unhone is dharna ko chunauti di ki mitti ke kanon kii sankhya itani badi he ki isaki gananaa nahin kii ja sakati he
 He wrote: "some people, King Gello, think that the number of soils is infinite in the infinite; and i believe that the soil is not only in Syracuse and the rest of Sicily, but in every region where there is housing or no housing

 The oldest document in which Archimedes works is Archimedes Palimpsest
 In 1906, a Danish professor, John Ludwig Heiberg, visited Constantinople and examined the Gotskin parchment of prayer written in the 13th century AD
 unhone paaya ki yah ek palimpcest tha, ek paathya se yukt ek dastavej jise mitaae gaye puraane kaary ke upar likhaa gaya tha
 To make the palimpsest, the ink on it was scraped off and reused, a common practice in the Middle Ages, as parchment was expensive

 It is exactly like a perfect black body in thermodynamics

 In contrast to electron and neutron contingency pressure, neither the Earth nor the Sun have the required mass and therefore neither the required gravitational force

 a black hole is often defined as an object whose migration velocity is greater than the speed of light
 yah tasvirgunatmak rup se galat he lekin kalenidr kii trigya ke pariman ke kram ko samajhane kaa ek tarika pradaan karti he
 The escape velocity is the minimum speed an object must have so that the object escapes the orbit of a gravitational source before stopping
 prithvi par palaayan veg 11
2 kimi / second ke baraabar he, atah vastu chaahe koi bhi ho, ek goli yaa ek ball, ise prithvi kii sataha par waapas girane se bachane ke liye kam se kam 11
2 kimi / second kii gati se chalanaa hoga
 To calculate the migration velocity in Newtonian mechanics, suppose there is a heavy object whose mass m is centered at the origin
 ek m { \ displaystyle m} dravyaman vaali duusari vastu mul se r { \ displaystyle r} kii duuri par v { \ displaystyle v} gati se shuru hoti he, infinity kii taraf bachakar nikalne kii koshish karti he, iske paas thik utani gatij urja honi chahie taaki vah nakaaratmak gurutvkarshan kii sambhavit urja se paar paa sake, baad main kuch bhi shesh na rahe: Thus, as it gets closer to r = ∞ { \ displaystyle r = \ infty}, its kinetic energy decreases, eventually reaching infinity without any motion
 yah formula critical palaayan veg v { \ displaystyle v} ko m { \ displaystyle M} or r { \ displaystyle r} ke sandarbh main darshata he
 But this formula also says that for each value of v { \ displaystyle v} and m { \ displaystyle M}, r { \ displaystyle r} has a critical value so that v { \ displaystyle v} is a particle of motion
 Only managed to escape: jab veg prakaash kii gati ke baraabar ho, yah ek kaalpanik neutonian dark star kii trigya pradaan karata he, ek neutonian sharir jahaan se prakaash kii gati se chalane vaala koi kan batch nahin saktaa he
 In the trend most commonly used for the value of the radius of a black hole, the radius of the event horizon is equal to this Newtonian value
 saamaanya saapekshata main, antariksh-samay kii vakrit prakruti or vibhinn nirdeshaankon ke chayan kii vajah se r nirdeshaank ko paribhaashit karnaa saral nahin he
 For this result to be true, the value of r must be defined so that r radius in curved space times a surface area of A sphere can still be revealed by this formula a = 4 π r 2 { \ displaystyle a This definition of = 4 \ pi r ^ {2}} r makes sense only if the gravitational field is spherically symmetric, so that there are many jackals on top of one that have a uniform gravitational field
 kisi vastu ke gurutvkarshan kshetra se batch nikalne ke liye palaayan veg uske ghanatv par nirbhar karti he; yah he, uske dravyaman or maatra kaa anupaat
 a black hole is formed when an object becomes so dense that even light cannot escape from it for a particular distance, because the speed of light will be less than the escape velocity of the black hole
 neutonian gurutvkarshan ke vipareet, saamaanya saapekshata main, kalenidr se dur jaataa hua prakaash dhimaa nahin padataa he or vaapis nahin mudata he
 The Schwarzschild radius is still the last distance from which the light can escape to infinity, but the exit light, starting at the Schwarzschild radius, does not return, it remains outside
 schvarjaschild trigya andar, prayek vastu andar kii taraf gati karti he, kisi prakaar centre main kuchle jane hetu
 In general relativity, the mass of the black hole may remain centered on a gravitational singularity), it may be a point, a ring, a light beam, or a sphere; At present, exact information about it is not available
 is singhulerity ke aasapaas ek golakaar seemaa hoti he jise ghatana kshitij kaha jaataa he
 It is the 'returning place' to the event horizon, a boundary beyond which all matter and radiation are drawn towards the singularity within
 kendrastha is singhulerity or ghatana kshitij ke bich kii duuri kalenidr kaa aakaar hoti he or yah ikai main dravyaman ke dugane ke baraabar hoti he jahaan g or c baraabar 1 hai
 The radius of a black hole with a mass equal to the Sun is about 3 km
 isse kai guni adhik duriyon ke liye, kalenidr kii guruttvakarshan shakti samaan dravyaman vaale kisi bhi anya sharir kii guruttvakarshan shakti ke thik baraabar hoti he, bilkul surya ke samaan
 Therefore, if the Sun is converted into a black hole of equal mass, the orbits of the planets will remain unchanged
 kai prakaar ke kalenidr hai, jo unke vishisht aakaar dwaara pahachaane jate hai
 When they form due to the gravitational collapse of a star, they are called stellar black holes
 gallexiyon ke centre main banane vaale kalahidron ke dravyaman saura dravyaman ke kai arab guna ho sakate hai, unhen vishalkay kaala chhidr kaha jaataa he kyonki ve ati vishaal hote hai
 There are also some intermediate black holes between these two scales, whose mass is up to several thousand times the solar mass
 bahut kam dravyaman vaale kalenidr kaa, jinke bare main aisa mana jaataa he ki unka nirmaan brahmand ke shuruaati itihaas main big baing ke dauraan hua hoga, ab bhi astitv bhi ho sakate hai or unhen primoradial kalachhidr kaha jaataa he
 Presently, their existence is not yet certain
 pratyaksh taur par ek kalenidr ko dekh paanaa sambhav nahin he
 However, its presence can be gauged by its gravitational effect on the surrounding environment, particularly by microvasives and active galactic nuclei, where substances falling into nearby black holes overheat and emit large amounts of X-ray radiation Huh
 yah prekshan vidhi khagolavidon ko unke astitv kaa pataa lagane main sakasham banaati he
 Black holes are the only substances that meet these scales and conform to the framework of general relativity
 ek aise baari sharir kii avadharana jisase ki prakaash bhi bachane se asamarth ho ko, bhuvigyaani jon michel dwaara 1783 main henry kavendish ko likhe gayi ek patr main prakat kiya gaya tha or royal socity dwaara prakashit kiya gaya tha: In 1796, mathematician pierre-simon Laplace promoted the idea in the first and second editions of his book Exposition du sistem du Monde
 unnisvin sadi main in "dark stars" par dhyaan nahin diya gaya tha, kyonki tab aisa mana jaataa tha ki prakaash drabyaman rahit tarang he atah gurutv ke prabhaav se mukt he
 Contrary to the modern black hole concept, it was believed that the object behind the horizon could not collapse
 1915 main, albert oinstin ne apane saamaanya saapekshata ke siddhant ko viksit kiya, ve pehle hi yah siddh kar chuke the ki gurutvkarshan prakaash kii gati par vastav main prabhaav daalata he
 a few months later, Karl Schwarzschild gave the solution of the gravitational field of a point mass and a spherical mass, showing that the existence of a black hole is theoretically possible
 schvarjaschild trigya ko ab gaiyr-chakrit blike hole ke ghatana kshitij kii trigya ke rup main janaa jaataa he, lekin is tathy ko us samay nahin samajha ja sakaa tha, udhaaharan ke liye schvarjaschild khud ise bhautik nahin maanate the
 Johannes Droste, a student of Hendrik Lorentz, independently gave a similar solution a few months after Schwarzschild on point mass and wrote extensively more about its properties
 1930 main, khagolvid subramanyan chandrashekhar nen saamaanya saapekshata kaa upyog karte hue yah gananaa kii ki electron-dijanret padaarth vaale ek gaiyr-chakrit sharir kaa saura dravyaman yadi 1
44 se adhik hua to uskaa patan ho jaayegaa
 His argument was opposed by Arthur Eddington, who believed that something would surely prevent this collapse
 edington aanshik rup se sahi the: chandrashekhar seemaa se thoda adhik drabyaman vaala safed bouna sitara patan ke baad neutron taare main parivartit ho jaayegaa
 lekin 1939 main, robert oppenheimer or unke sahyogiyon ne bhavishyavaanee kii ki chandrasekhar dwaara die gaye kaarnon kii vajah se, lagbhag teen se adhik saura drabyaman vaale sitara kaa patan ek blike hole ke rup main ho jaayegaa
 Oppenheimer and his co-authors used the Schwarzschild coordinate system, which produced mathematical specificity at the Schwarzschild radius, in other words, some of the components used in this equation became infinite at the Schwarzschild radius
 iskaa arth yah niklaa gaya ki schvarjaschild trigya ek "bulbule" kii seemaa thi jisamen samay "ruk" jaataa tha
 This is a valid point of view from outside, but not for those who fall inside
 is visheshta ke kaaran, patan ho chuke taron ko kuch samay ke liye "frozen stars " ke naam se janaa gaya, kyonki ek bahari paryvekshak ko taare kii sataha us samay main jami hui dikhaai degaa jis pal main taare kaa patan use schvarjaschild trigya ke andar le ja rahaa hoga
 This is a known feature of modern black holes, but it must be emphasized that the surface light of the frozen star redshifts very quickly and turns the black hole to black very quickly
 kai bhautikavid is vichaar ko sweekaar nahin kar paa rahe the ki schvarjaschild trigya ke bheetar samay ruk jaataa he or 20 varshon tak is bishay par logon ki ruchi nahin rahi thi
 In 1958, David Finkisten introduced the concept of the event horizon by presenting Eddington – Finkelstein coordinates, which enabled him to prove that the Schwarzschild surface r = 2 m is not a specificity but rather serves as an ideal monolithic membrane
 Is: The causal effects can cross it in one direction
 isamen or openhimer ke parinaamon ko koi khaas virodhabhas nahin tha, balki isane ek andar girte hue paryvekshak ke drushtikon ko shaamil karke iskaa vistaar hi kiya
 All theories up to now, including Finkelstein, covered only non-rotating black holes
 1963 main, roy ker ne aavarti blike hole ke liye ekadam sateek samaadhaan khoj liya
 Its rotated singularity was not a dot but a ring
 kuch samay baad, roger penros yah sabit karne main sakasham ho gayi ki singhulerity sabhi blike holon ke andar pai jaati hai
 In 1967, astronomers discovered Pulsar and within a few years were able to prove that the known Pulsars are fast-rotating neutron stars
 us samay tak, neutron taare bhi sirf saidhantik utsukata tak hi simit the
 Hence the discovery of pulsars aroused interest in all those high-density objects whose structure would have been possible by gravitational collapse
 bhautikavid jon whealer ko vyapak rup se 1967 main die gaye apane saarvajanik bhaashan hamaara brahmad: gyaat or agyaat main blike hole shabd ko gadhane kaa shrey diya jaataa he, adhik dushkar "gurutveey rup se purnatah patan ko praapt kar chukaa tara" ke ek vikalp ke rup main
 However, Wheeler insisted that the term was coined by someone else at the conference and he only adopted it as a useful short-word
 yah shabd 1964 main eni aving dwaara AAAS ko likhe ek patr main bhi uddhrut kiya gaya tha: When the entire fuel of a big star is burnt, a huge explosion occurs in it, which is called a supernova
 visphot ke baad jo padaarth bachataa he vah dhire dhire simatana shuru hota he or bahut hi ghaney pind kaa rup le letaa he jise neutron star kehete hai
 If the neutron star is too large, the pressure of gravity will be so low that it will shrink with its own weight and become so dense that a black hole will form and appear as a black hole, a black hole or a black hole
 no hair prameya main kaha gaya he ki, ek baar sthapit ho jane ke baad blike hole ke keval teen swatantra bhautik lakshan hote hai: dravyaman, charge or koniya gati
 If the values of these two black holes have the same values or parameters, then it becomes quite difficult to distinguish between them
 ye lakshan khaas hote hai kyonki ye blike hole ke baahar se dikhaai dete hai
 For example, a charged black hole, like any other charged object, pushes the same charge away, despite the fact that photons, which are responsible for the electrical and magnetic forces, do not escape the internal field
 iskaa kaaran he gous niyam, ek bade sphier se baahar nikalne vaala kul vidyut pravaah hameshaa samaan rahata he or sphier ke bheetar ke kul charge ko maapta he
 When the charge falls into the black hole, electric field lines persist and peek beyond the horizon, and these field lines conserve the total charge of all falling materials
 bijli kshetra line antat blike hole kii sataha par samaan rup se fail jaati hai, sataha par samaan kshetra line ghanatv sthapit karti hai
 In this context, the black hole acts like a common conducting sphere that has a certain resistivity
 isi tarah, blike hole ko samahit kiye hue ek sphere ke kul dravyaman ko gaus niyam ke gurutveey anuroop kaa upyog karke paaya ja saktaa he, blike hole se bahut dur baithe baithe
 Similarly, angular momentum can be measured from far away, by gravitational-magnetic field using frame dragging
 jab blike hole kisi padaarth ko nigalata he, uskaa kshitij gharshan yukt vistrut jhilli kii tarah dolan karata he, ek kshanik pranali, jab tak yah antim avasthaa main sthapit nahin ho jaataa
 This is different from other field theories such as electromagnetism or gauge theory, which never have any friction or resistivity because they are time reversible
 kyonki blike hole antat ek antim avasthaa main keval teen maapdandon ke saath sthapit hota he, praarambhik sthitiyon ke bare main jaankaree ko khone se bachaane kaa koi tarika nahin he: blike hole ke gurutvkarshan or vidyut kshetra uske andar jane vaali chizon ke bare main bahut kam jaankaree pradaan kar pate hai
 Missing information includes everything that cannot be measured at great distances from the black hole horizon, such as the total baryon number, the lepton number, and almost all other preserved pseudo-charges in particle physics
 yahan se karnaa he yah vyavhaar itnaa ajeeb he ki ise 'blike hole jaankaree nuksaan virodhabhas' kaha gaya he
 Traditionally, the disappearance of information in black holes is quite strange, because general relativity is a Lagrangian theory that appears to be time reversible and Hamiltonian from above
 lekin kshitij ke kaaran blike hole samay palatwaan nahin hota he: padaarth isamen ghus sakate hai par nikal nahin sakate
 The reversal of time in a common black hole is called a white hole, although entropy and quantum mechanics show that white holes are similar to black holes
 no-hair prameya hamaare brahmad or usamen shaamil padaarthon kii prakruti ke bare main kuch manyataon banaata he, jabaki anya manyatayen alag nishkarsh pradaan karti hai
 For example, if magnetic single-poles exist, as stated by some theories, magnetic charge would be the fourth parameter of a conventional black hole
 nimnlikhit maamalon ke liye no-hair prameya ke prati-udahaaran gyaat hai: These exceptions are sometimes unstable and sometimes do not lead away from black holes to newly preserved quantum numbers
 hamaare chaar-aiami or lagbhag sapaat brahmand main is prameya ko lagu hona chahie
 The simplest black hole is one that has a mass but has neither charge nor angular momentum
 in blike hole ko schvarjaschild blike hole ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, bhautikavid karl schvarjaschild ke naam par jinhone 1915 main is samaadhaan kii khoj kii thi
 This was the first reliable and accurate solution to be discovered for the Einstein field equation and according to the Birkhoff theorem it is the only vacuum solution that is spherically symmetric
 iskaa matlab yah he ki is tarah ke ek blike hole ke gurutvkarshan kshetra or samaan dravyaman kii kisi bhi anya golakaar vastu ke gurutvkarshan kshetra bich koi drishy antar nahin he
 For the black hole, the popular belief that it "pulls every object in" around itself is true only near its horizon; At a distance, its external gravitational field is essentially the same as that of ordinary heavy bodies
 blike hole ke adhik saamaanya samaadhaan 20 veen sadi ke uttarardh main khoje gayi the
 The Reisner – Nordström metric describes a black hole with electric charge, while the Kerr metric provides a rotating black hole
 kerr -newman metric saamanyatya adhik prachlit sthir blike hole samaadhaan he, jo charge or koniya gati donon kaa varnan karata he
 Although the mass of a black hole can take any positive value, charge and angular momentum are constrained by mass
 prakritik ikaayiyon main, kul charge q { \ displaystyle q \ ,} or kul koniya gati j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} se ummid kii jaati he ki ve nimnlikhit ko santusht karenge For a black hole with mass M
 is asamanta ko bharne vaale blike hole ko extrimal kaha jaataa he
 Solutions of Einstein's equations that violate inequality exist, but do not have horizons
 in samaadhaanon main nagn vishistataa he or inhen abhautik mana jaataa he, kyonki cosmik sensorship pariklpana vaastavik padaarthon ke samgr gurutvkarshan patan kii vajah se is vishistataa ko nakaar detii he
 This is supported by numerical representations
 vidyut chumbakeey bal kii apekshaakrit badi takat ke kaaran, taron ke patan se banane vaale blike hole se apeksha kii jaati he ki ve taron ke neutral charge ko banaaye rakhenge
 Rotation has been considered a common feature of compact objects and it appears that the angular momentum of the binary hole X-ray source GRS 1915 + 105, a candidate for a black hole, is close to its maximum possible value
 blike hole ko saamanytah unke dravyaman ke anusaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, koniya gati j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} se swatantra
 ghatana kshitij trigya, yaa shwarzschild trigya, dwaara nirdhaarit blike hole kaa aakaar dravyaman m { \ displaystyle m \ ,} ke anupaat main hota he, Where rsh { \ displaystyle r_ {sh} \ ,} is the Schwarzschild radius and m ⨀ { \ displaystyle m _ { \ bigodot}} is the mass of the Sun
 is prakaar ek blike hole kaa aakaar or dravyaman saadhaaran rup se sambandhit hote hai, roteshan se swatantra
 According to this criterion, black holes are classified as follows: blike hole kii vishistataa he ghatana kshitij kaa prakat hona; antariksh-samay kii ek seemaa jiske pare ghatnaayen ek bahari paryvekshak ko prabhavit nahin kar sakati hai
 As predicted by general relativity, the presence of mass distorts the space-time in such a way that the paths of the particles lead them to that mass
 blike hole ke ghatana kshitij par yah vikruti itani shaktishaalee ho jaati he ki baahar jane kaa koi maarg bachataa hi nahin he
 Once a particle enters the event horizon, it becomes inevitable to go inside the black hole
 dur khadey ek darshak ke liye, blike hole ke nikat kii ghadiyaan zyada dhire chalati prathit hongi
 Because of this effect, the spectator standing far away will notice that an object falling into a black hole slows down as it approaches its event horizon, seemingly taking infinite time to reach it
 usee samay is vastu kii sabhi kriyaayein dhimi ho jaati hai jiske parinaam swaroop nikalne vaala prakaash adhik laal or maddham prathit hota he, is prabhaav ko gravitational red shift kaha jaataa he
 Finally, the falling object becomes so dim that it stops appearing, at one point just before it reaches the event horizon
 gaiyr-chakrit blike hole ke liye schvarjaschild trigya spherical ghatana kshitij ko seemaa-mukt karti he
 The Schwarzschild radius of an object is proportional to the mass
 chakrit blike hole main vikrut, nonspherical ghatana kshitij hota he
 Since the event horizon is not a physical surface but only a mathematically defined boundary, there is nothing preventing matter or radiation from entering the black hole, only they are prevented from exiting
 blike hole ke liye saamaanya saapekshata dwaara diya gaya varnan ek sanniktan he or aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki kwantum gurutv prabhaav ghatana kshitij ke nikat se mahatvapurn ho jate hai
 This makes the observation of matter near the event horizon of a black hole, the study of general relativity and its proposed extents
 haalaanki blike hole swayan urja vikirit nahin karte hai, ghatana kshitij ke thik baahar se, hawking vikiran ke madhyam se, vidyut-chumbakeey vikiran or padaarth kan vikeern ho sakate hai
 Singularity occurs at the center of the black hole, where there is an infinite density due to the suppression of matter, the gravitational pull is infinitely powerful and there is infinite distortion in space-time
 iskaa matlab ek blike hole kaa dravyaman shunya volum vaale ek kshetra main purnatah sankuchit ho jaataa he
 This zero-volume, infinitely dense region at the center of a black hole is called gravitational singularity
 ek gaiyr-chakrit blike hole kii singhulerity kii lambaai, chaudai or oonchaai shunya hoti he; ek chakrit blike hole kii singhulerity challe ke aakaar kii hoti he or roteshan ke plane main sthit hoti he
 The rings have no thickness so there is no volume
 saamaanya saapekshata main singhulerity kii upasthiti ko saamanytah siddhant ke lagu na hone kaa sanket mana jaataa he
 Although this is expected; This occurs in situations where quantum mechanical effects should have been described, due to extremely high densities and particle interactions
 ab tak kwantum or gurutv ke prabhaav kaa ek hi siddhant main sangyojan karnaa sambhav nahin ho sakaa he
 It is generally expected that the theory of quantum gravity will contain black holes without singularity
 photone sphere shunya motaai vaali ek spherical seemaa he jahaan sphere kii sparsharekha main chalate hue photone ek gol kaksha main funs jaayenge
 For non-recurring black holes, the radius of the photon sphere is 1
5 times the Schwarzschild radius
 ye kakshaen gatisheel rup se asthir hai, isliye koi bhi choti si gadbady bhi samay ke saath badi hoti jaayegi or yaa to use blike hole ke pare phenk degi yaa ghatana kshitij ke bheetar dhakel degi
 Although light can still escape from inside the photon sphere, any light that crosses the photon region from the inside and outward trajectory will be occupied by a black hole
 isliye koi bhi prakaash jo photone sphere ke andar se baahar khadey ek darshak tak pahunchataa he, nishchit rup se photone sphere ke adanr parantu ghatana kshitij ke baahar kii kisi vastu dwaara utsarjit hua hoga
 Other compact objects such as neutron stars may also have photon spheres
 yah tathy is baat par aadhaarit he ki ek vastu kaa gurutv kshetra uske vaastavik aakaar par nirbhar nahin karata, isliye koi vastu jo schvarjaschild trigya ke 1
5 guna se adhik choti ho us, vastu ke drabyaman se sambandhit ek photone sphere vastav main hoga
 The rotating black hole surrounds the ergosphere salt in an inter-time zone in which it is impossible to stand still
 yah frem-dreging naamak ek prakriya kaa parinaam he; saamaanya saapekshata kii bhavishyavaanee he ki koi bhi chakrit drabyaman, swanyam ko ghere hue antariksh samay ko thodaa khinchne kii cheshtaa karegaa
 Any object near the rotating mass will start moving in the direction of the wheel
 ek chakrit blike hole ke liye ghatana kshitij ke paas iskaa prabhaav itnaa majboot ho jaataa he ki kisi vastu ko sthir khadey rahane maatr ke liye iske vipareet disha main prakaash ki gati se bhi tej chalanaa hoga
 The ergosphere of a black hole is surrounded by the following: argosphior ke bheetar, antariksh-samay prakaash se adhik gati se khinchaa jaataa he-- saamaanya saapekshata main bhautik vastuon kaa prakaash se tej gati se chalanaa varjit he, lekin antariksh-samay kshetron ko anumati detaa he ki ve anya antariksh-samay kshetron kii tulana main prakaash se tej chal saken
 Objects and radiation can remain in orbit within the ergosphere without falling into the center
 lekin ve mandara nahin sakate, kyonki iske liye unhen swayan ke antariksh-samay kshetra kii tulana main peeche kii ore prakaash se bhi tej chalane kii aavashyaktaa hogi, jo ek bahari darshak kii tulana main prakaash se tej chal rahe hai
 Objects and radiation can also escape from the ergosphere
 asal main penros prakriya bhavishyavaanee karti he ki vasteen kabhi kabhi agosphior ud kar baahar chali jaayengi, iske liye urja ve blike hole kii kuch urja ko "chura" kar praapt karengi
 If a large part of the total mass of objects escapes in this way, the speed of the black hole will slow down and eventually stop moving
 blike hole kii aakarshak chhavi ke kaaran yah sawaal uthanaa lajimi he ki kya vastav main is prakaar kii vicitra vastuon kaa astitv he, yaa ye oinstin samikarnon ke kaalpanik samaadhaan maatr he
 Einstein himself had the mistaken belief that the formation of black holes is not possible, as he believed that the angular momentum of particles leading to collapse would stabilize their motion
 isaki vajah se saamaanya saapekshata samudaay kai varshon tak iske virdohi parinaamon ko khaarij karata rahaa
 But some of them maintained the belief that black holes actually existed, and by the late 1960s they were able to convince most researchers that the creation of event horizons was indeed possible
 ek baar ek ghatana roger penros ne yah siddh kar diya ki uske bheetar kahin na kahin singulerity kaa nirmaan avashya hoga
 Shortly thereafter, Stephen Hawking demonstrated that syngularity existed in many cosmic solutions of the Big Bang, in the absence of scalar fields and other foreign matter
 kerr samaadhaan, no-hair prameya or blike hole ushmpravagiki ke niyamon ne darshaya ki blike hole ke bhautik lakshan saral hai or aasaani se samajhe ja sakate hai, inhen shodh ke sammanit vishyon kaa darja mil gaya
 It is believed that the primary process of building black holes may have been the gravitational collapse of heavy objects such as stars, but there are many other processes that can lead to the creation of black holes
 gurutveey patan tab hota he jab ek vastu kaa aantarik dabaav uske apane gurutvkarshan kaa virodh karne ke liye aparyaapt ho
 This usually occurs in stars because either the "fuel" is insufficient to maintain its temperature in the stars, or a star that was stationary would receive a lot of extra material but not raise its core temperature
 donon sthitiyon main, taare kaa taapmaana swayan ke vajan tale apane patan ko roak paane ke liye aparyaapt sabit hoga 
 This collapse can be prevented by the mutual pressure of the star components, the material condenses into an attractive dense state
 iskaa parinaam, ek prakaar kaa compact tara
 kis kism kaa compact tara banegaa yah avshesh ke drabyaman par nirbhar karegaa - patan ke kaaran hue parivartanon ke baad bache hue padaarthon nen bahari satahon ko nestnabud kar diya he
 Note that this will be much less than the original star - residues with more than 5 solar masses are produced by stars that must have been greater than 20 before their collapse
 yadi avshesh kaa dravyaman ~ 3-4 saura drabyaman se adhik ho-- kyonki mul tara yaa to bahut baari tha yaa avshesh ne atirikt drabyaman ekatra kar liya he)- neutron kaa apjaatya dabaav bhi patan ko rokane ke liye aparyaapt he
 After this, there is no known process that can stop this collapse and the object will degenerate into a black hole
 baari taron ke is gurutveey patan ko hi adhikansh taarakeey drabyaman vaale blike holon ke gathan ke liye jimmedaar mana jaataa he
 Gravitational collapse requires much higher density
 brahmad ke vartmaan yug main yah ucch ghanatv keval taron main hi milti he, lekin praarambhik brahmad main big baing ke sheeghra baad ghanatv kaaphi adhik hua karte the, ho saktaa he isi ne blike hole ke nirmaan ko sambhav banaaya ho
 High density alone is not sufficient for the creation of a black hole because the uniform distribution of masses will not allow the mass to accumulate
 is ghaney madhyam main pracheen blike holon ke gathan hetu, praarambhik ghantviya gadabadiyon kaa hona aavashyak he jo baad main swayan ke gurutv ke prabhaav main bad saken
 There are wide differences in the size of these disturbances in various models of the early universe
 vibhinn modelon ne blike hole ke nirmaan kaa purvanumaan lagaaya tha, plank dravyaman se lekar saikadon hajaaron saura drabyamanon tak ke
 Therefore, primitive black holes can be the reason for the formation of any type of black hole
 gurutveey patan hi ekmaatr prakriya nahin he jo blike hole kaa nirmaan kar sakati he
 In theory, the creation of black holes is also possible in high-energy collisions that create sufficient densities
 haalaanki, abhi tak, aisi kisi bhi aisi koi ghatana ko pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup main, kan twarak prayogon main drabyaman santulan kii kami ke rup main nahin paaya gaya he
 This implies that there should be a lower limit to the mass of the black hole
