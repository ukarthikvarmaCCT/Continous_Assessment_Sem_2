ek saal pehle angreji sarkaar ne sar jon simon ke netritv main ek nayaa samvedhanik sudhaar ayog banaaya jisamen ek bhi sadsy bhartiya nahin tha
 This resulted in a boycott by Indian political parties
 disambar 1928 main gandhi ji ne kalakatta main yojit congress ke ek adhiveshan main ek prastaav rakhaa jisamen bhartiya samrajya ko satta pradaan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha athwa aisa na karne ke badale apane uddeshy ke rup main sampurna desh kii aazaadee ke liye asahyog andolan kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar rahen
 Gandhiji not only fueled the ideas of the youth group like Subhash Chandra Bose and Jawaharlal Nehru demanding immediate independence but also stopped his own demand for one year instead of two years
 angrejon ne koi jawaab nahin diya

 This conference was a great disappointment for Gandhi and the nationalists, because it was focused on Indian prices and Indian minorities rather than transferring power

 Gandhi was arrested again and the government tried to prevent his followers from being influenced by Gandhi, keeping him completely away from them
 lekin, yah yukti safal nahin thi
 In 1932, through the campaigning of Dr
 Babasaheb Ambedkar, a Dalit leader and scholar scholar, the government approved separate elections to the untouchables under a new constitution
 iske virodh main dalit haton ke virdohi gandhi ji ne sitambar 1932 main chha: din kaa anshan le liya jisane sarkaar ko safaltaapurvak dalit se rajnatik netaa bane palavankar baaluu dwaara kii gai madhyasta vaali ek samaan vyavastha ko apnaane par bal diya
 Untouchables by Gandhi to improve the lives of the campaign was conducted

 On 8 May 1933, Gandhiji undertook a 21-day fast of self-purification to help the Harijan movement
 yah nayaa abhiyaan daliton ko pasand nahin aayaa tathaapi ve ek pramukh netaa bane rahe
 Dr
 Ambedkar categorically condemned Gandhiji's use of the word Harijan, that Dalits are socially immature and that Indians belonging to the privileged caste have played a patriarchal role
 ambedkar or uske sahyogi dalon ko bhi mahasoos hua ki gandhi ji daliton ke raajnneetik adhikaron ko kam aank rahe hai
 Even though Gandhiji was born into a Vaishya caste, he insisted that he could raise his voice for Dalits despite a Dalit Masiha like Dr
 Ambedkar

 There is an iconic temple here, Guruvayur Temple, in which the statue of Lord Guruvayurappan, showing the form of Lord Krishna, is installed
 aazaadee se purv anya mandiron kii bhaanti is mandir main bhi harijanon ke pravesh par purna pratibandh tha
 The pro-gandhi supporter of Kerala, Mr
 Kelappan, raised his voice against this practice under the orders of the Mahatma and finally civil disobedience was started in 1933

 For this reason, the meeting of the trustees of Guruvayur temple called a meeting and received the opinion of the worshipers of the temple

 When the Congress Party chose to contest elections and accepted power under the federal scheme, Gandhiji decided to resign from the membership of the party
 vah party ke is kadam se asahmat nahin the kintu mahasoos karte the ki yadi ve istipha dete hai tab bharatiyon ke saath uski lokapriyata party kii sadsyta ko majboot karne main aasaani pradaan karegi jo ab tak communiston, samaajwaadiyon, vyapaar sanghon, chaatro, dharmik netaaon se lekar vyapaar sanghon or vibhinn awaajon ke bich vidyaman thi
 This will give all of them an opportunity to listen to their own words

 Gandhiji returned to India in 1936 with the Lahore session of the Nehru Presidency and Congress
 haalanki gandhi kii purna ichha thi ki ve aazaadee praapt karne par apana sampurna dhyaan kendrit karen na ki bharat ke bhavishya ke bare main atakalon par
 This did not prevent the Congress from adopting socialism as its objective
 1938 main raashtrapati pad ke liye chune gaye subhash bose ke saath gandhi ji ke matbhed the
 Gandhi's main points in differences with Bose were Bose's lack of commitment to democracy and lack of faith in non-violence

 In the beginning, Gandhi favored non-violent moral support to the efforts of the British, but other Congress leaders opposed the unilateral inclusion in the war without consulting the representatives of the public

 congress ke sabhi chaynit sadasyon ne samuhik taur par apane pad se istipha de diya
 After a long discussion, Gandhi declared that India would not be a party to any war if it fought outside for democratic independence when India itself was denied independence
 jaise jaise yuddh badhata gaya gandhi ji ne aazaadee ke liye apni maang ko angrejon ko bharat chodo aandolan naamak vidheyak dekar teevr kar diya
 This was the most obvious rebellion of Gandhi and the Congress Party which was aimed at expelling the British from the Indian border

 Some believed that opposing the British in their lifetime or in the struggle for death was a mortal task while some believed that Gandhiji was not doing enough
 bharat chodo is sangharsh kaa sarvaadhik shaktishaalee andolan ban gaya jisamen vyapak hinsa or giraftaar hui
 Thousands of freedom fighters were either killed or injured by police bullets and thousands were arrested
 gandhi or unke samarthakon ne spasht kar diya ki vah yuddh ke prayaason kaa samarthan tab tak nahin denge tab tak bharat ko tatkaal aazaadee na de di jaae
 He clarified that this time also this movement will not stop if individual acts of violence are materialized
 unhone kaha ki unke chaaron ore araajaktaa kaa aadesh asli araajaktaa se bhi bura he
 He asked all Congressmen and Indians to maintain discipline for ultimate freedom by doing or die with non-violence

 Gandhiji was held captive for two years at Agah Khan palace, Pune
 yahi vah samay tha jab gandhi ji ko unke nijee jivan main do gahare aghat lage
 His 50-year-old secretary Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack 6 days later and his wife Kasturba Gandhi died on 22 February 1944 after Gandhiji spent 18 months in jail
 iske chha: saptaah baad gandhi ji ko bhi malaria kaa bhayankar shikaar hona padaa
 He was released before the end of the war on 6 May 1944 due to his poor health and necessary treatment

 Although the Quit India movement was a partial success in its objective, but the stubborn suppression of the movement united India by the end of 1943
 yuddh ke ant main, british ne spasht sanket de diya tha ki santta kaa hastantaran kar use bharatiyon ke haath main somp diya jayega
 At this time Gandhiji stopped the movement, which led to the release of about 100,000 political prisoners including Congress leaders
 gandhi ji ne 1946 main congress ko british kebinet mishan ke prastaav ko thukaraane kaa paraamarsh diya kyoki use muslim bahulata vaale praanton ke liye prastaavit samoohikaran ke prati unka gahan andeh hona tha isliye gandhi ji ne prakaran ko ek vibhaajan ke purvaabhyas ke rup main dekha
 However, for some time, this also became one of the incidents of differences with the Congress with Gandhiji as Nehru and Patel knew that if the Congress did not approve the plan then the control of the government would be passed on to the Muslim League
 1948 ke bich lagbhag 5000 se bhi adhik logon ko hinsa ke dauraan maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 Gandhiji was against any such scheme which divided India into two different countries
 bharat main rahane vaale bahut se hinduon or sikhon evam muslimon kaa baari bahumat desh ke bantwaare ke paksh main tha
 Additionally, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, introduced extensive cooperation in West Punjab, Sindh, North West Frontier Province and East Bengal
 vyapak str par failane vaale hindu muslim ladaai ko rokane ke liye hi congress netaaon ne bantwaare kii is yojana ko apni manjuuri de di thi
 Congress leaders knew that Gandhiji would oppose Partition and it was impossible for the Congress to move forward without his consent, because Gandhi's support in Partarthy and his position throughout India was strong
 gandhi ji ke kareebi sahyogiyon ne bantwaare ko ek sarvottam upaay ke rup main sweekaar kiya or sardaar patel ne gandhi ji ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya ki naagarik ashaanti vaale yuddh ko rokane kaa yahi ek upaay he
 Mazabur Gandhi gave his permission
 unhone uttar bharat ke saath-saath bengal main bhi muslim or hindu samudaay ke netaaon ke saath garm ravaiye ko shant karne ke liye gahan vichaar vimarsh kiya
 Despite the india-pakistan war of 1947, he was harassed when the government decided not to give Rs 55 crore to Pakistan as per the agreement made by the Partition Council
 sardaar patel jaise netaaon ko dar tha ki pakistan is dhan kaa upyog bharat ke khilaaf jang chhedane main kar saktaa he
 When the demand arose that all Muslims should be sent to Pakistan and the Muslims and Hindu leaders expressed dissatisfaction on this and Gandhiji was deeply shocked by his refusal to compromise with each other
 unhone dilli main apana pehla aamaran anshan aarambh kiya jisamen sampradayik hinsa ko sabhi ke liye tatkaal samaapt karne or pakistan ko 55 karod rou0 kaa bhugtan karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 Gandhiji feared that instability and insecurity in Pakistan would increase his anger towards India and spread violence on the border
 unhen aage bhi dar tha ki hindu or muslim apni shatruta ko phir se nayaa kar denge or usase naagarik yuddh ho jane kii ashanka ban sakati he
 After a passionate debate with allies who had supported Gandhi ja throughout his life, Gandhiji refused to accept the matter and the government had to stick to its policy and make payments to Pakistan
 hindu muslim or sikh samudaay ke netaaon ne unhen vishwaas dilaayaa ki ve hinsa ko bhula kar shanti laaenge

 He tried to learn by experimenting on his own mistakes and on his own to achieve this goal
 unhone apni aatmakatha ko satya ke prayog kaa naam diya
 Gandhi said that the most important battle to be fought is to conquer elements like your demons, fear and insecurity
 
gandhi ji ne apane vichaaron ko sabase pehle us samay sankshep main vyakt kiya jab unhone kaha bhagwaan hi satya he baad main unhone apane is kathan ko satya hi bhagwaan he main badal diya
 Thus, Gandhi's philosophy in truth is "god"

 Non-violence, non-violence and non-violence has a long history in Indian religious thought and has many concepts in its Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Jewish and Christian communities

 One eye for another will make the whole world blind
 marane ke liye mare paas bahut se kaaran he kintu mere paas kisi ko maarane kaa koi bhi kaaran nahin he
 In applying these principles, Gandhiji did not turn away from taking them to the most logical extent to show the world where the government, police and the army also became non-violent
 " for pasifists
" naamak pustak se uddhran liye gaye hai
 The war of science leads a person to dictatorship, pure and simple

 In an interview given after the war in 1946, he presented an idea even further
 yahudiyon ko apane liye swayan kasaai kaa chaaku de dena chahie tha
 They should have thrown themselves into the sea from sea rocks
 phir bhi gandhi ji ko pataa tha ki is prakaar ke ahimsa ke str ko atoot vishwaas or saahas kii jarurat hogi or iske liye usne mahasoos kar liya tha ki yah har kisi ke paas nahin hota he
 He therefore advised everyone that they do not need to keep non-violence with them, especially when it is used for the protection of cowardice

 Before coming to London to study, Gandhiji had made a promise to his mother Putlibai and his uncle Bechariji Swamy that he would abstain from eating meat, drinking alcohol and from concussion
 unhone apane vaayade rakhane ke liye upwas kiye or aisa karne se saboot kuch aisa mila jo bhojan karne se nahin mil saktaa tha, unhone apane jivan paryant darshan ke liye aadhaar jo praapt kar liya tha

 Josiah Oldfield, the chairman of the London Vegetarian Society
 henry stephen salt|henry stephen salt kii kritiyon ko padhne or prashansha karne ke baad yuva mohandas gandhi shaakaahaari prachaarak se mili or unke saath patrachaar kiya
 Gandhiji spent a lot of time advocating vegetarian food while in London and thereafter
 gandhi ji kaa kahana tha ki shaakaahaari bhojan na keval sharir kii jaruraton ko puraa karata he balki yah aarthik prayojan kii bhi purti karata he jo maance se hoti he or phir bhi maance anaaj, subjiyon or falon se adhik manhagaa hota he
 Apart from this, many Indians who were struggling due to low income, who were seen as vegetarian at that time, it was not only spiritual tradition but also due to practicality
 They avoided eating for too long, and political Fasting as a protest, he refused to eat until his death
 His autobiography notes that being a vegetarian is a celibacy
 His success in total control celibacy without first ladder to re commitment, almost failed

 Gandhiji felt a tremendous crime and he could never forgive himself for this
 This incident in m had a significant impact on Gandhi and he turned to celibacy at the age of 36, while he was married

 Gandhiji believed that if a person is employed in social service, then he should move on to a more ordinary life, which he considered necessary for celibacy
 Their simplicity forced them to abandon the Western lifestyle and they were spreading to South Africa, calling it "bringing themselves to a state of zero", which required unnecessary spending, adopting a simple lifestyle and washing their own clothes
 On one occasion, he also returns the gift provided to the birthmother for his continued service to the Samudayas

 He was knowledgeable of Brahm Gyan and read all the major religions in detail
 unhone hindu dharm ke bare main nimnlikhit baaten kahi hai- Gandhi has also interpreted the Bhagavad Gita in Gujarati
 Mahadev Desai has translated the Gujarati manuscript into English with additional role and description
 It was published in 1946 with the foreword written by Gandhi
 gandhi kaa maananaa tha ki prayek dharm ke mul main satya or prem hota he
 They say that 'see the Quran', 'bible', 'jend-avesta', 'talmud', or 'gita' by any means, we all have one God, and that is the true and loving nature

 25 janvari ko bhi unhone logon ko is ghatana ke sandarbh main asprishyata ko mahapaap maanakar tyaagane kii prerana di tathaa 26 janvari ko madura main vyapaariyon dwaara yojit swaagat samaaroh main unhone kaha ki mujhe to yah vishwaas hota ja rahaa he ki ham par yah vipatti asprishyata ke is mahapaap ke falswaroop hi ai he
 i request you not to laugh at my words and think that i am awakening your instinct of superstition
 main aisa kuch nahin kar rahaa hoon
 


 i may be called superstitious, but what i am feeling in the depths of my heart, i cannot live without telling you
 


 yadi aap bhi meri hi tarah is baat main vishwaas karte hon to aap nirnay karne main tatparta baratenge or yah maanenge ki aaj ham jaisi asprishyata baratate hai waisi asprishyata kaa vidhaan hindu shastron main nahin he
 You will agree with my view that to consider any man untouchable is a terrible sin
 manushya kaa ahankaar hi usase aisa kahata he ki vah anya logon se shreshth he
 Ravindranath Tagore, considering Gandhiji's idea to be indiscriminate by being able to promote superstition, wrote that the definite and only root cause of physical disasters is due to the sum of certain physical facts
 


 hamaare paap athwa trutiyaan chaahe kitni bhi bhayankar kyon na hon inamen itnaa bal nahin he ki sristi ke dhaanche ko tahas-nahas kar saken
 In response to this, Gandhi ji, while clarifying his perspective in detail, wrote that i have a lively belief in the interaction of natural phenomena and human behavior happening in the universe and because of that belief, i have come closer to God, i have humility and i have become more and more ready to present myself to God
 yadi main apane ghor agyaan ke kaaran us vishwaas kaa upyog apane virodhiyon kii ninda karne ke liye karuun to nishchay hi aisa vishwaas patankaaree andhvishwaas ban jaayegaa
 Instead of making an air debate on Gandhiji and making arbitrary conclusions, it is not only an age-old requirement but also a prudence to keep in mind the authenticity of the basis of Gandhiji's beliefs
 saamaanya se vishisht tak -- sabhi sandarbhon main dastaveji rup praapt gandhi ji kaa likhaa-bolaa praayah prayek shabd adhyayan ke liye uplabdh he
 So it is naturally necessary that in view of them, something should be taken to a proper stage
 likhane kii pravriti gandhiji main aarambh se hi thi
 Throughout his life he has written more than Vachik
 chaahe vah tippaniyon ke rup main ho yaa patron ke rup main
 In addition to writing many books, he also took out many magazines and wrote them well
 unke mahatvapurn lekhan kaary ko nimna binduon ke antargat dekha ja saktaa he: Gandhiji was a successful writer
 kai dashakon tak ve anek patron kaa sampadan kar chuke the jisame harijan, indian opinian, yang india aadi sammilit hai
 When he returned to India, he started a monthly magazine called 'navajivan'
 baad main navajivan kaa prakaashan hindi main bhi hua
 Apart from this, he wrote letters to individuals and newspapers almost everyday gandhi ji dwaara moulik rup se likhit pustaken chaar hai-- hind swaraj, dakshin africa ke satyagrah kaa itihaas, satya ke prayog, tathaa gita padaarth kosh sahit sampurna gita kii tikaa
 Gandhiji usually wrote in Gujarati, but translated or got his books translated into Hindi and English as well
 hind swaraj naamak alpakaay granthratna gandhiji ne england se lautate samay kildonon casil naamak jahaaj par gujarati main likhaa tha or unke dakshin africa pahunchne par indian opinian main prakashit hua tha
 The first twelve chapters in the December 11, 1909 issue and the remaining in the December 18, 1909 issue
 pustak rup main iskaa prakaashan pehali baar janvari 1910 main hua tha or bharat main bombay sarkaar dwaara 24 march 1910 ko iske prachaar par pratibandh laga diya gaya tha
 Gandhiji responded to this action of the Bombay Government by publishing an English translation of it
 is pustak ke parishisht-1 main pustak main pratipaadit vishay ke adhik adhyayan ke liye 20 pustakon kii suchi bhi di gayi he jisase gandhiji ke tatkaaleen adhyayan ke vistaar kii ek jhalak bhi milti he
 'history of South Africa's Satyagraha' originally started writing 'south African Satyagrahana History' in Gujarati on 26 November 1923 while he was in Yerwada Jail
 5 farvari 1924 ko reeha hone ke samay tak unhone pratham 30 adhyay likh daale the
 This history was published as an article in the 'navajivan' from 13 April 1924 to 22 November 1925
 pustak ke rup main iske do khand kramshah 1924 or 1925 main chape
 The first edition of the English translation by Valji Desai was published by S
 Ganesan Madras in 1928 and the second and third editions by Navjivan Prakashan Mandir, Ahmedabad in 1950 and 1961, with the required modifications
 aatmakatha ke mul gujarati adhyay dharawahik rup se 'navajivan' ke ankon main prakashit hue the
 It began with the publication of 'preamble' in the issue of 29 November 1925 and its completion from the last chapter titled 'purnahuti' in the 3 February 1929 issue
 gujarati adhyyon ke prakaashan ke saath hi hindi navajivan main unka hindi anuwaad or yang india main unka angreji anuwaad bhi diya jaataa rahaa
 Accordingly, the translation of 'preamble' was published in the 3 December 1925 issue of 'hindi Navajivan'
 hindi anuwaad main aatmakatha kaa pehla khand pustak ke rup main pehali baar sasta sahitya mandal, dilli se san 1928 main prakashit hua tha
 Navjivan Trust, the proprietor of Gandhiji's works, published his Hindi translation on his behalf in 1957
 shrimadbhagavadgita se gandhi ji kaa hardik lagaav praayah aaajeevan rahaa
 His contemplation and writing on the Gita also continued for a long time
 sampoorn gita kaa gujarati anuwaad, prastaavna sahit, unhone june 1929 main puraa kiya tha or 12 march 1930 ko navajivan prakaashan mandir, ahmedabad se 'anasakti yoga' naam se uskaa pustakaakaar prakaashan hua tha
 Its translation into Hindi, Bangla and Marathi was also instant
 angreji anuwaad iske baad janvari 1931 main sampann hua tha tathaa pehle yang india ke ank main prakashit hua tha
 Since the translation of each verse of the Gita was not easily comprehensible to the general readers, Gandhi ji wrote the expressions of each chapter of the Gita in a comprehensible way for the general readers
 yarvada central jail main 1930 or 1932 main prayek saptaah patr ke rup main ye bhav bhi narayandas gandhi ko bheje jate rahe taaki unhen ashram kii prarthana sabhaaon main padhe jaayen
 These were later published in book form named 'geeta-bodh'
 inke atirikt bhi unhone gita par prarthana sabhaaon main anek pravachan diye the
 Gandhiji's association with the Gita was such that despite his very busy life he prepared a syllabus for each verse of the Gita specifying the meaning of the verse as well as his place of use
 in samast samagriyon kaa ekatra prakaashan hi 'gita mata' ke naam se hua he
 The decision of the publication of a Granthamala by the Government of India for the publication of the complete and written literature of Gandhiji has undoubtedly been a historic step in the publishing world
 is granthmala kaa uddeshy gandhi ji ne din-prati-din or varsh-prati-varsh jo kuch kaha or likhaa us sabko ekatra karnaa tha
 Under this decision, the entire Gandhi Vaamya was published with the help of many learned scholars
 yah prakaashan teen bhashaaon main hua
 It has been published for the first time in 100 volumes in English and 98 volumes in revised form
 hindi main 97 khandon main tathaa gujarati main 70 khandon main yah prakashkeey mahakumbh sampann hua he
 Two additional features are also included in the entire Gandhi speech
 ek to yah ki prayek khand ke ant main aksharkram se shabdanukramanika di gayi he jisase adhyayan tathaa vibhinn kaaryvash punarawalokan main atyant suvidha ho gayi he; tathaa duusari yah ki prayek khand ke ant main gandhi ji kaa tareekhwar jivan-vrittant diya gaya he, jisase saraltapurvak ek nazar main gandhiji ke jivan kii sabhi mahatvapurn ghatnaon evam baton kii sankshipt jaankaree uplabdh ho jaati he
 In addition to this, the collection of selected pieces from Gandhiji's entire literature and small booklets focusing on different topics have also been published under different names
 inamen do sanchayan ati prasiddh tathaa atyupayogi rahe hai or in donon kaa prakaashan bhi gandhi ji ke jivan-kaal main hi ho gaya tha: Gandhiji has also interpreted John Ruskin's Unto This Last in Gujarati
 antim niabandh ko unka arthshaastra se sambandhit kaarykram kaha ja saktaa he unhone shaakaahaar, bhojan or swasthya, dharm, saamaajik sudhaar par bhi vistaar se likhaa he
 In 2000, a revised version of Gandhiji's entire work came under controversy as Gandhiji's followers accused the government of including changes for political purposes

 Due to this reason there was a dispute in India at the time of publication of the book, and the Legislative Assembly of Gandhi's home state of Gujarat prohibited the sale of this book through a resolution
 leliveld ke mutabik, unki pustak ke aadhaar par gandhi kii samalangi yaa dwillingi hone ke lagaae ja rahe aankalan galat hai

 In Harijan on 6 October 1946, he wrote about the partition of India to create Pakistan: jaisaa kii muslim lig dwaara prastut kiya gaya gaiyr-islamic he or main ise paapyukt kehane se nahi hichakoongislam maanav jati ke bhaichaare or ekta ke liye khadaa he, na ki maanav parivaar ke eky kaa avrodh karne ke liye
is vajah se jo yah chaahate hai ki bharat do yuddh ke samoohon main badal jaae ve bharat or islam donon ke dushman hai
 They can cut me into pieces but cannot persuade me for something that i think is wrong, we should not give up, despite the fact that we should be able to keep Muslims in captivity of their love
 phir bhi, jaik homer gandhi ke jinna ke saath pakistan ke vishay ko lekar ek lambey patrachaar par dhyaan dete hue kehete hai- "haalaanki gandhi vaiyaktik rup main vibhaajan ke khilaaf the, unhone sahmati kaa suzav diya jiske tahat congress or muslim lig asthaayee sarkaar ke neeche samjhauta karte hue apni aazaadee praapt karen jiske baad vibhaajan ke prashn kaa faisla un jilon ke janamat dwaara hoga jahaan par musalamaanon kii sankhya zyada he

 Gandhi had also expressed his dislike for the partition of Palestine for the creation of Israel by partition at the end of 1930
 26 oktober 1938 ko unhone harijan main kaha tha: i received many letters in which i was asked to declare what i think about the persecution of Jews in Germany and arab-jews
 Not that i will be able to give my thoughts on this difficult question without hesitation
 My sympathies are with the Jews
 main unase dakshin africa se hi najdiki rup se parichit hoon kuch to jivan bhar ke liye mere saathi ban gaye hai
 It was through these friends that i came to know about the harassment that has been happening for a long time
 They have been untouchables of Christianity, but my sympathy does not exonerate me from the need for justice
 The call of a nation to Jews does not attract me much
 Whose approval was given in the Bible and the insistence with which they started wanting Palestine in their return
 kyon nahi ve, prithvi ke dusre logon se prem karte hai, us desh ko apana ghar banaate jahaan par unka janm hua or jahaan par unhone jivicoparjan kiya
 Palestinians belong to the Arabs, in the same way that the British inland and France the French
 It is unfair and inhumane to impose Jews on Arabs, whatever is happening in Palestine today cannot be vindicated by any code of conduct

 To this criticism, Gandhi said, "there was a time when people used to listen to me how the British could be fought without arms because then there were no weapons
" 

par aaj mujhe kaha jaataa he ki meri ahimsa kisi kaam kii nahi kyonki isse hindu-musalamaanon ke dango ko nahi roka ja saktaa isliye aatmaraksha ke liye sashastr ho janaa chahie
" He made his argument in several articles, such as Homer's Jacques's The Gandhi Reader: a Source of His Writings and Life
 In 1938, when "anti-semitism and anti-semitism" was first written, Gandhi described the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 as a satyagraha
 He offered to use the method of non-violence for the hardships faced by Jews in Germany
 What happened agar main ek yahudee hota or germany main janma hota or apana jivicoparjan vahiin se kar rahaa hota to germany ko apana ghar maanata iske vaavjood ki koi sabhy german mujhe dhamkata ki vah mujhe goli maar degaa yaa kisi andhakupakaragaar main fank degaa, main tadipaar or matbhediye aacharan ke adheen hone se inkaar kar doongaa 
 or iske liye main yahudee bhaaiyon kaa intazaar naahe karuunga ki ve aayen or mere vaidhanik pratrodh main mujhase juden, balki mujhe aatmavishvaas hoga ki akhir main sabhi meraa udahaaran maanane ke liye baadhya ho jaayenge
 yahan par jo nuskhaa diya gaya he agar vah ek bhi yahudee yaa saare yahudee sweekaar kar len, to unki sthiti jo aaj he usase badtar nahi hogi
 or agar die gaye peeda ko ve swechhapurvak sah len to vah unhen andruni shakti or anand pradaan karegaa or hitler kii suvichaarit hinsa bhi yahudiyon kii ek saadhaaran nar sanhaar ke rup main nishkarshith ho tathaa yah uske atyaacharon kii ghoshnaa ke khilaaf pehla jawaab hogi
 agar yahudiyon kaa dimag sweyapurvak pidaa sahane ke liye tayar ho, meri kalpana he ki sanhaar kaa din bhi dhanyavad gyaapan or anand ke din main badal jayega jaisaa ki jihova ne gadhaa

 i only request that if one renounces violence from the heart, then in conclusion it will create a power through practice which is due to great sacrifice
 unhone aalochanaon kaa uttar "yahudee mitro ko jawaab" or "yahudee or philistin" main diya yah jaahir karte hue ki "maine hriday se hinsa ke tyaag ke liye kaha jisase nishkarshtah abhyaas se ek shakti srujit karegaa jo ki bade tyaag ki vajah se he
 Gandhi's statement about the imminent sacrifice of Jews attracted criticism from many commentators
 martin bubar, jo kii swayan yahudee rajya ke ek virdohi hai ne gandhi ko 24 farvari, 1939 ko ek tikshn aalochanatmak patr likhaa
 bubar ne dridhtaa ke saath kaha ki angrejon dwaara bhartiya logon ke saath jo vyavhaar kiya gaya vah naajiyon dwaara yahudiyon ke saath kiye gaye vyavhaar se bhinn he, iske alaava jab bhartiya utpedan ke shikaar the, gandhi ne kuch avasaron par bal ke prayog kaa samarthan kiya
 Gandhi referred to the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 within the Satyagraha
 navambar 1938 main uparavit yahudiyon ke naaji utpedan ke liye unhone ahimsa ke upaay ko sujhaayaa: It seems that there is no parallel in the history of German persecution of Jews
 The dictators of yesteryear have never been so mad as Hitler was and they do it with religious fervor that they are presenting a unique religion and war nation in whose name any inhumanity becomes the rule of humanitarianism, And will be awarded in future
 Clearly, the crime committed by an insane but fearless youth will fall upon the entire race with unbelievable ferocity
 If ever there is a just war in the name of humanity, then the war against Germany's brash oppression towards a Puri Kom is complete Can be said to be appropriate
 par main kisi yuddh main vishwaas nahi rakhata
 ise yuddh ke napha-nuksaan ke bare main charchaa mere adhikaar kshetra main nahi he
 But if war cannot be fought against such crime against Jews by Germany, then how can there not be an alliance with Germany, how can there be an alliance between such countries, one of which claims justice and democracy And the other one who has been declared the enemy of both? " gandhi ke dakshin africa ko lekar shuruaati lekh kaaphi vivadaspad hai 7 march, 1908 ko, gandhi ne indian opinian main dakshin africa main unke karagaar jivan ke bare main likhaa "kafir shashan main hi asabhy hai - kaidi ke rup main to or bhi

 "on the subject of immigration in 1903, Gandhi commented that" i believe that as much as they believe in the purity of their caste, we also 


 We believe that the white race in South Africa should be the best caste Should
 "during his time in South Africa, Gandhi repeatedly objected to the social classification of Indians with blacks, which he describes as" undoubtedly complete It is superior to the Kafirs "
 It is worth noting that the Kafir had a different meaning from the one currently being used in Gandhi's time
 These statements of Gandhi gave him an opportunity to accuse some people of being racist

 At the center of chapter one, "gandhi, African-born Indians in colonial status" which is about the relationship between African and Indian communities in "white supremacy" and the policies that led to the partition, he says, "young Gandhi was influenced in 1890 by the divisive ideas that prevailed at that time

 As a response to these two approaches to Gandhi, Bhana and Vahed argue: They want people to justify Gandhi for his political purpose after apartheid in South Africa
 They ignore some of the facts about him, in part because Don't help much; And those who call him only a racist are equally guilty of misrepresentation / are equally guilty of perversion
 " Gandhi was anti-raj in the form where he had a vision of an India that was not under any government
 unka vichaar tha ki ek desh main sachche swashaasan kaa arth he ki pratyak vyakti khud par shashan karata hai tathaa koi aisa rajya nahin jo logon par kanoon lagu kar sake
 On some occasions he has called himself a philosophical anarchist
 In his sense, an independent India exists with thousands of small self-sufficient communities that rule on their own without the hurdle of others
 iskaa yah matlab nahin tha ki britishon dwaara sthapit prashashnik dhaanche ko bharatiyon ko sthanantarit kar dena jiske liye unhone kaha ki hindustan ko ingalistaan bananaa he

 is samay, is tathy se pare ki yah desh ek ghanaa van tha, tathaa isliye sainya abhiyaanon ke liye sarvatha anupyukt tha, british logon ko upree burma ke vishay main bahut kam jaankaree thi; parantu irawadi nadi ke mahaan nadi rajmarg par british steamer kai varshon se rangoon se mandley tak chal rahe the, tathaa yah swaabhaavik hi tha ki british abhiyaan ko sabase tej tathaa santoshjanak rup se jalmaarg se sidhe rajdhani tak le jaaya jaye

 The British post closest to the frontier was in Thayethmyo, and within five days of receiving Thibou's reply, the entire expedition had gathered here by 14 November
 usee din general prendergast ko kaarywahi prarambh karne kaa nirdesh praapt ho gaya
 The Burman king and his country were shocked by the intensity of this attack
 unke paas ekatrit hone tathaa koi pratirodh sangathit karne ke liye samay nahin tha
 They could not create any obstruction by submerging steamers etc
 and on the day of receipt of the order, armed steamers Irrawaddy and Kathleen engulfed the nearby Burman artillery, and the Burman king's steamer and some other barrels, for the same use Was ready, drowned
 16 taarikh ko donon taton par sthit topakhane ko thal akraman dwaara apane kabje main kar liya gaya, burman log chunki iske liye taiyaar nahin the, ve koi koi pratirodh nahin kar paae
 tathaapi 17 navambar ko minhala main, jo ki nadi ke daayen tat par tha, kaaphi maatra main maujuud burman sena ne ek ke pashchaat ek morcha, ek pagoda tathaa minhala ke garh par kabza kar liya
 Under the bombardment from across the river, a brigade of British Indian infantry defeated the Burman, escalating the attack, killing 170 Burman squads, capturing 276 captives and many more attempts to flee
 i drowned in the river and died
 yah abhiyaan agle kuch dinon tak chalata rahaa, nausena palaton tathaa baari topakhane ne ek ke pashchaat ek nyong-you, pakokku tathaa myingyan sthit burman pratiraksha panktiyon ko shant kar diya
 However, some sources say that the Burman resistance was not as intense as Theobo's Defense Minister Kinwon Min Gyi Yoo Koung, who wanted to make a treaty with the British people, asked the Burman forces not to attack the British
 His order was followed by some Burman platoons, but not by all
 iske atirikt british logon ne apane mithyaa prachaar se burman logon ko dhokhaa diya, unhone aisa darshaya jaise ki ve desh par lambe samay tak shashan nahin karnaa chaahate hai, unka uddeshy sirf raja thibow ko rajgaddi se hataanaa tathaa rajkumaar nyong yaan ko nayaa shaasha bana kar rajgaddi par baithaana he
 At that time, the majority of Burmese did not like Thebaw because of its misrule, as well as about a hundred royal princes and princesses who were killed when he was ruling in 1878

 On November 26, when the fleet was approaching the capital Aava, the representative of King Thebaw approached General Prendergast with a proposal of surrender; And on the 27th, when the naval ships were about to reach outside the city and start the attack, the troops received orders to lay down their king's weapon

 In the meantime, however, the surrender of the Burmese king was completed; And on November 28, within a fortnight of the declaration of war, Mandalay had fallen, and King Theobo had been taken captive, each powerful fort on the river, the king's artillery, thousands of rifles, guns, and weapons in his possession

 Burma was annexed by the British on 1 January 1886

 Resistance was broken by collective punishment on the villages
 gaanvon ko jala diya gaya or graminon kii sampatti ko jabt yaa nasht kar diya gaya
 The country was finally brought under control due to the intense retaliation by the British towards the villages supporting the rebels
 british logon ne apana niyantran kachin parvat tathaa chin parvat ke janajati kshetron tak sthapit kar liya
 These governed areas, over which the Burmese also had only nominal control, now also came under British territory

 No description of the Third Burmese War could be complete without the first land expansion in the country
 It was started in the country from Toungue from November 1885, which was the British frontier post in the eastern part of the country

 Bihari Lal or Bihari was a famous poet of the Hindi customs
 biharilal kaa janm sanwat 1595 ke aasapaas gwalior main hua
 He belonged to the Mathur Choubey community
 unke pita kaa naam keshavaray tha
 When Bihari was 8 years old, his father brought him to Orchha and his childhood was spent in Bundelkhand
 inke guru keshavadas the or yuvavastha sasuraal mathura main vyateet hui, jaise kii nimna dohe se prakat he - jaipur-king Sawai Jai Singh was so immersed in the love of his new queen that he did not even leave the palace and paid no attention to the royal palace
 mantri aadi log isse bade chintit the, kintu raja se kuch kehane ko shakti kisi main na thi
 Bihari took this task on himself
 unhone nimnlikhit doha kisi prakaar raja ke paas pahunchaaya - This couplet acted like a mantra on the king
 ve rani ke prem-pash se mukt hokar punah apana raaj-kaaj sanbhaalane lage
 He was so impressed with the poetic efficiency of Bihari that he asked Bihari to create more couplets and pledged to give one Asharfi per couple
 bihari jaipur naresh ke darbar main rahakar kavy-rachana karne lage, vahaan unhen paryaapt dhan or yash mila
 The only creation of Bihari is Satsai
 yah muktak kavy he
 It contains 719 couplets
 katipay dohe sandigdh bhi maane jate hai
 All the couplets are beautiful and admirable, however, when looked at closely, about 200 couplets are very excellent
 'satsai' main brajabhasha kaa prayog hua he
 Braj Bhasha was at that time recognized as a well-known and all-poet-revered poetical language of North India
 iskaa prachaar or prasar itnaa ho chukaa tha ki isamen anekarupata kaa aa janaa sahaj sambhav tha
 Bihari made a successful attempt to keep it with uniformity and kept it in definite literary form
 isse brajabhasha manjkar nikhar uthi
 Satsai can be divided into three main parts - policy-oriented, devotional and spiritual-minded, and aristocratic
 inamen se shringaaraatmak bhaag adhik he
 Kalachamatakara is attained with tact everywhere
 shringaaraatmak bhaag main roopang saundarya, saundaryopkaran, nayak-nayikabhed tathaa haav, bhav, vilaas kaa kathan kiya gaya he
 The hero-heroine is also found mainly in three forms - the protagonist is Krishna and the heroine Radha in the first form
 inkaa chithran karte hue dharmik or darshanik vichaar ko dhyaan main rakhaa gaya he
 Therefore, in this deep sense is the chief, and there is spiritual mystery and religion; In the second form, Radha and Krishna are not explicitly mentioned, but their appearance is illuminated and the idealized images are presented with a bizarre euphemism
 isse isamen loukik vaasana kaa vilaas nahin miltaa
 Loksambhava Nayaka in the third form is a clear picture of the heroine
 isamen bhi kalpana kala kaushal or kavi paramparaagat aadarshon kaa put purna rup main praapt hota he
 The absolute cosmic form is very short and very short
 'satsai' ke muktak dohon ko krambaddh karne ke prayaas kiye gaye hai
 There are 25 types of sequences, out of which 14 types of sequences have been seen, the remaining 11 types of sequences which are in vaccines are not received
 kintu koi nishchit kram nahin diya ja sakaa
 In fact, it seems that these couplets were composed from time to time, then selected and collected and collected
 keval mangalacharnatmak dohon ke vishay main bhi isi se vichaar vaichity he
 If the idea of 'mere Bhav Baad Harau' is the first invocation of this couplet i
e
 only Radhopasaka and if 'mor Mukut Kati Kachhini' - take this couplet, then only a special banakwali Krishnamurti Bihari's idol idol becomes the main - Bihari was actually a Krishnopasak, it is clear
 satsai ke dekhne se spasht hota he ki bihari ke liye kavy main ras or alankaar chaaturya chamatkaar tathaa kathan kaushal donon hi anivaary or aavashyak hai
 In such a way, they can put their couplets in two classes, in one class they will come in couplets which have the preponderance of Rasa Rourkarya and special attention has been given to the spirituality
 alankaar chamatkaar inamen bhi he kintu vishesh pradhan nahin, varan ras pariposhkata or bhavotkarshakta ke liye hi sahaayak rup main yah he
 In the second category, there are couplets which do not give characterization to spirituality, but preeminence is given to ornament miracles and utterances or utterances
 kisi vishesh alankaar ko uktivaichitrya ke saath safalataa se nibaaha gaya he
 In this way, it is to be believed that the miracle of miracle has not been forgotten
 ras ko utkarsh dete hue bhi alankaar kaushal kaa apakarsh bhi nahin hone diya gaya
 Thus it should be said that Bihari Rasalankarasiddha was a poet; Not only niti vishyak dohon main vastut: sarasata rakhana kathin hota he, unamem uktiauchity or vachanavakrata ke saath chaaru chaaturya chamatkaar hi prabhavotpadak or dhyanakarshan main sahaayak hota he
 This is clearly found in the strategic couplets
 phir bhi bihari ne inamen sarasata kaa saraahneey prayaas kiya he
 The same thing also comes in the submission of philosophical principles and religious sentiments because they naturally have their own differences
 phir bhi bihari ne unhen sarasata ke saath prastut karne main safalataa pai he
 Heartfelt expressions of devotion are rarely seen in couplets
 samyavastha vishesh main bihari ke bhavuk hriday main bhakthibhaavna kaa udai hua or uski abhivyakti bhi hui
 In Bihari, there is no predominance of daily sentiment, they pray to God, but not inferiorly
 prabhu kii ichha ko hi mukhya maanakar vinay karte hai
 Bihari has taken inspiration from the liberated compositions of his predecessor Siddha poets, such as Aryasaptashati, Gathasaptashati, Amarukashatak, etc
 - Some of them have been cut and beautiful in the form of expressions, some have been upgraded and some have been kept as they are
 saundarya yah he ki deergh bhaavon ko sankshipt rup main ramyata ke saath apni chhap chhodte hue rakhane kaa safal prayaas kiya gaya he
 Many poets and writers wrote commentaries on 'satsai'
 kul 54 tikaayen mukhya rup se praapt hui hai
 Ratnakar ji's vaccine is in a way the last vaccine, it is very beautiful
 satsai ke anuwaad bhi sanskrit, urdu aadi main hue hai or katipay kaviyon ne satsai ke dohon ko spasht karte hue kundalia aadi chhandon ke dwaara vishishtikrut kiya he
 Bhavasamya is also revealed along with other earlier poets
 kuch tikaayen farsi or sanskrit main likhi gayi hai
 The commentators have also kept the sequence of couplets in Satsai with their own views
 saath hi dohon kii sankhya bhi newnaadhik di he
 It is not entirely certain how many couplets were composed
 sambhav he, jo satsai main aae ve chunakar aae kul dohe 700 se kahin adhik rache gaye honge
 Bihari has composed so many couplets throughout his life, it is not completely valid
 'satsai' par katipay aalochakon ne apni aalochanaayen likhi hai
 It has been criticized since its poetry
 pratham kaviyon ne satsai kii maarmik visheshta ko sankethik rup se suchit karte hue dohe or chand likhe
 Urdu poets did likewise
 yatha : How many such statements are popular
 vistrut rup main satsai par aalochanatmak pustaken bhi idhar kai likhi gai hai
 In addition, many commentaries have also been published in the modern period
 inaki tulana vishesh rup se kaviver dev se kii gai or ek ore dev ko, duusari ore bihari ko badhkar siddh karne kaa praytn kiya gaya
 Two books, 'dev and Bihari' written by Pt
 Krishnavihari Mishra and 'bihari and Dev' by Lala Bhagwadin are notable
 ratnakar ji ke dwaara sampadit 'bihari ratnakar' naamak tikaa or 'kaviver bihari' naamak aalochanatmak vivechan vishesh rup main avlokaneey or pramanik hai
 Shringar is the main theme of Bihari's poetry
 unhone shringaar ke sanyog or viyog donon hi pakshon kaa varnan kiya he
 In the coincidence side, Bihari has very subtle portrayal of gestures and experiences
 usamen badi maarmikata he
 See an example of combination - bihari kaa viyog, varnan bada atishyokti purna he
 That is why she lacks naturalism, depicting the frail heroine's weakness in Virah, making her like a pendulum of a clock - sufi kaviyon kii ahaatmak paddati kaa bhi bihari par paryaapt prabhaav padaa he
 The body of the heroine is so hot due to disconnection, that the rose water poured on it dries up in the middle - bihari multah shringaari kavi hai
 His devotion is towards radha-krishna and that is where it has appeared
 satsai ke aarambh main mangala-charan kaa yah doha radha ke prati unke bhakthi-bhav kaa hi parichaayak he - Bihari has also written couplets of policy and knowledge, but his number is very small
 dhan-sangrah ke sambandh main ek doha dekhie - Bihari has been second to none in the depiction of nature
 shat rituon kaa unhone bada hi sundar varnan kiya he
 See the picture of summer ॠ - bihari gaav waalo ki arsikt kaa uphaas karte hue kehete hai- Bihari had great knowledge of various subjects like astrology, medicine, mathematics, science etc
 atah unhone apane dohon main uskaa khub upyog kiya he
 See this couplet full of mathematical facts - bihari kii bhashaa saahitiyik braj bhashaa he
 In it, the developed form of the moving Braj language of Sur is found
 purvi hindi, bundelkhandi, urdu, farsai aadi ke shabd bhi usamen aae hai, kintu ve latakate nahin hai
 The word selection of Bihari is very beautiful and meaningful
 shabdon kaa prayog bhaavon ke anukool hi hua he or unamem ek bhi shabd bharti kaa prathit nahin hota
 Bihari has also used idioms in some languages in his language
 jaise - There are three types of Bihari style according to the subject yadhyapi bihari ke kavy main shant, hasya, karun aadi rason ke bhi udhaaharan mil jate hai, kintu mukhya ras shringaar hi he
 Bihari has adopted only two verses, Doha and Soratha
 doha chand kii pradhanta he
 Bihari couplets are exquisite Samas-style specimens
 dohe jaise chote chand main kai-kai bhav bhar dena bihari jaise kavi kaa hi kaam tha
 Bihari is very good at showing the craftsmanship of the ornaments
 unke prayek dohe main koi na koi alankaar avashya aa gaya he
 In some couplet, many ornaments have got place simultaneously
 atishyokti, anyokti or sanrupak bihari ke vishesh priy alankaar hai anyokti alankaar kaa ek udhaaharan dekhie - The fame of a poet depends not on the magnitude of the texts composed by him, but on the quality
 bihari ke saath bhi yahi baat he
 The Satasai Granth alone immortalized him in Hindi literature
 shringaar ras ke granthon main bihari satsai ke samaan khyaati kisi ko nahin mili
 There were many commentaries of this book and many poets based their couplets and composed verses like Kavitta, Chappaya, Savaiya etc
 bihari satsai aaj bhi rasik janon kaa kavy-haar bani hui he
 Due to the collective power of imagination and the concurrent power of language, Satsai's couplet implies the filling of the ocean in Gagar
 unke vishay main thik hi kaha gaya he - Due to its poetic qualities, Bihari is counted in the category of Mahakavis even if he did not compose the epic

 The calculating semaphore is not a closed / open flag of a single resource, but a counter to a set of available resources
 iskaa avishkaar edsgar digcastra ne kiya tha
 Semaphore dining philosophers are the classic solution to preventing race conditions in the problem, although they do not prevent resource deadlock
 semfor tak abhigaman nimnlikhit kaaryon ke upyog se hi sambhav he
 Those marked as atomic should not cause disruption, the reasons for this are explained below
 p / / Acquire Resource{wait until s > 0, then s := s-1; / * Testing and decrementing s must be atomic to avoid race conditions* / } v / / Release Resource {s: = s + 1; / * Must be atomic * / } Init {s := v;} Note that the increment of the variable s should not be constrained and the task p should not be interrupted when the value of s is obtained larger than 0
 This is done by using a special instruction, such as test-and-set, or Interruptions can be done by neglecting to prevent other processes from being activated
 ek semafor kaa maan sansaadhan main rikt ikaayiyon kii sankhya ke baraabar hota he
 Task p is busy-waiting or perhaps asleep until a resource is available and then immediately claims a resource
 v iskaa vipareet he; prakriya dwaara sansaadhan kaa prayog purna ho jane par yah keval sansaadhan uplabdh karaata he
 Init is used to provide semaphores only initial values before any request is made
 kaary p tathaa v atomic hone chahie, jiskaa arth yah he ki usee semafor par koi anya kaary karne ke liye kisi bhi prakriya ko un kaaryon ke bich main kabhi bhi roka nahin janaa chahie
 Formal names, p and V, originate from the first letters of Dutch words
 v kaa arth he verhogen, athwa "vruddhi"
p ke liye vibhinn vyakhyaayein deen gayi hai " ke liye passeer, "prayaas" probeer tathaa "pakadana" pakken sahit), lekin vastut: digcastra ne likhaa he ki p se unka aashay nirmit-shabd prolaag tha, jo probeer te verlagen, yaa "prayaas karo-or-ghatao " kaa sankshipt rup he, "
yah bhram is tathy ke kaaran utpann hota he ki dach bhashaa main vruddhi tathaa kami donon ke liye prayog hone vaale shabd v varna se hi shuru hote hai or in shabdon ke purna rup kaa prayog gaiyr-dach-vaktaaon ke liye asambhav rup se bhraamak hoga
 In the programming language ALGOL 68, functions in the Linux kernel and in some English textbooks, p and v are called down and up, respectively
 software ejineering kii paddati main unhen aksar wait tathaa signal, yaa acquire tathaa release, yaa pend tathaa post kaha jaataa he
 In some books these are called procurement and vacate to match the original Dutch initials
 vyast-pratiksha se bachane ke liye semafor main prakriyaaon kii ek sambaddh qatari ho sakati he 
yadi koi prakriya kisi aise semfor par ek p kaary karti he, jiskaa maan shunya he, to is prakriya ko semfor kii kyuu main jod diya jaataa he
 When another process increases the semaphore by performing v and processes are present in Q, one of them is removed from q and its execution resumes
 jab prakriyaaon kii praathamiktaayen bhinn hoti hai, to kyuu ko praathamikta ke kram main rakhaa ja saktaa he, taaki ucchtam praathamikta vaali prakriya ko kyuu se sabase pehle liya jaae
 Admittedly, the 'resources' are public toilet toilets and the 'processes' that seek access to toilets are either those who are standing in a queue waiting for any toilet to be available, or those people Who are already using the toilet
 shauchalay ke baahar baitha vyakti is baat kaa dhyaan rakhata he ki is samay kitne shauchalay uplabdh hai or iske baad kise bheetar janaa chahie
 The number of empty toilets is the semaphore value, which indicates the number of available empty resources
 jab koi prakriya shauchalay kaa abhigaman karnaa chahta he, to semafor use yah batayega ki use qatari main pratiksha kerani hogi yaa vah shauchalay kaa prayog kar saktaa he
 If the toilet is empty, that person gets access and the number of empty toilets is reduced by 1
 This means that the number of vacant toilets is reduced by 1
 yadi rikt shauchalayon kii sankhya 0 he, to vyakti ko tab tak qatari main pratiksha kerani hogi, jab tak ki yah rikt na ho jaae 
ek baar jab vyakti shauchalay kaa prayog kar letaa he, to aglaa vyakti uskaa prayog kar saktaa he
 This means that the number of vacant toilets has now increased by 1
 Now the value of s has grown to 0 and the waiting person can now access the toilet
 uplabdh shauchalayon kii maang karne, rikt shauchalayon kii sankhya ko adhyatan karne tathaa qatari main pratiksha karne kii prakriya ko kisi bhi anya prakriya dwaara baadhit nahin kiya janaa chahie
ise atomic kaary kaha jaataa he
 This queue is a first-in first-out cue, which means that the person standing first in the queue will get the opportunity to use the empty toilet first
 However, if the person standing at any other place in the queue wants to use the toilet immediately
 , The queue can be arranged
 semafor se ek se adhik 'ikai' kii maang karne yaa ise lautaane kii kshamta ke dwaara counting semafor kii avadharana kaa vistaar kiya ja saktaa he
 In fact, the UNIX semaphore works in this way
 sanshodhit p tathaa v kaary is prakaar sanchalit hote hai: p {wait until s> = howmany; s: = s - howmany; / * must be atomic operation * / } V{s:=s + howmany; / *must be atomic* / } To understand why this is better than calling a simplified version of p a 'howmany' bar, consider the following problem
 We assume that you have a collection of n resources, which we can use with a fixed size
 Buffer
 You might want to use a counting semaphore to keep track of the available buffers, which are initialized by N
 When a process wants to allocate a buffer, that semaphore The call and p and receives a buffer
 yadi koi bafer uplabdh na hon, to ek prakriya tab tak pratiksha karti he, jab tak koi anya prakriya kisi bafer ko mukt nahin kar detii or semafor par v ko kol nahin kar leti
 Assume that there are two processes, which are buffers KN, respectively
 a simple implementation would be that the first process would call the simple subtraction conversion of p times k on the semaphore, and the second process would call the simple subtraction conversion of p on the semaphore l times
 However, this method might result in deadlock: Imagine that the operating system allows the first process to be executed
 tab, jab ki pehali prakriya ne keval z babers kaa hi niyantran praapt kiya ho, to duusari prakriya ko kriyanvayan kaa samay dene ke liye oparating system pehali prakriya ko roak detaa he
 The second process starts receiving buffers
 haalanki, jab duusari prakriya babers praapt karti he, to semafor 0 ho jaataa he or duusari prakriya kisi anya prakriya dwaara kuch or babers mukt kiye jane tak nilambit ho jaati he 
antat: oparating system pehali prakriya ko shesh babers, jinaki ise aavashyaktaa he, kii khoj aage badhaane ke liye pun: shuru hone kii anumati detaa he
 Unfortunately, since semaphore is 0, the first process cannot complete this task, so it is also suspended while waiting for more buffers to be freed by another process
 na to pehali or na hi duusari prakriya kaary ko jari rakhane ke liye paryaapt babers praapt kar sakati hai or isliye donon main se koi bhi prakriya sangrah ko koi bafer nahin lautaati
is prakaar, ve ek gatirodh kii sthiti main funs jaati hai
 In the modified version of Semaphore, the first process will call for k buffers, which it will receive by an atomic function, after which NK units will remain in the semaphore
 Then the second process will come, which will reduce the semaphore to NKL and since it is a negative Is the number, so will wait
 When the first process frees the buffers and increases the semaphore, then as soon as the semaphore reaches 0, it means That collection are available in l element, may start another process and can get all the buffers
 is baat par dhyaan diya janaa chahie ki semafor kii gananaa sangrah main uplabdh babers kii sankhya ke baraabar hona aavashyak nahin he
 It is necessary to check the condition S> = 0 twice in p and wait for it to guarantee that the various processes that are added to the semaphore waiting list do not interfere with each other's requests: one process until The semaphore's calculation does not change, unless it is the next process in Q
 In the actual implementation, this task makes the waiting process for the intermediate step as appropriate Without active Unable to add is
 semafor kaa prayog aaj bhi un programing bhashaaon main prachlit he, jo aatanrik rup se sinchroniteeshan ke anya roopon kaa samarthan nahin karatin
ve anek oparating systams main sinchroniteeshan ke praarambhik tantra hai
 However, the development of programming languages tends toward more structured forms of synchronization, such as monitors
 Semaphores, along with their inadequacy to deal with deadlock, do not protect the programmer from mistakes such as re-taking semaphores already taken by a process and forgetting to free semaphores taken
 chunki semafor ke saath ek gananaa judi hoti he, at: unka prayog us samay kiya ja saktaa he, jab anek threads ko saath milakar kisi uddeshy ko praapt karne kii aavashyaktaa ho
is udhaaharan par vichaar karen: In addition to counting semaphores, there is also a "blocking semaphore"
 blocking semafor ek aisa semafor hota he, jise 0 se inishlaise kiya jaataa he
 The effect of this is that any thread that acts p on the semaphore is blocked
 semafor ke prayog ke liye saamanyat: un kaaryon kii anviktaa kii guarantee dene hetu hardware samarthan kii zarurat hoti he, jinhen isaki aavashyaktaa ho
computor kii masini bhashaaen vishishtat: un nirdeshon ko sammilit karti hai, jinhen vishesh rup se semafor kaa dhyaan rakhte hue taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 These special instructions complete a read-change-write cycle in memory, which is not only non-interruptable, but is being performed by any other processor or input / output device at the same location in the memory
 Also removes all functions
 vishesh nirdesh is baat kii guarantee dete hai ki unka prayog karke ek semafor vidhi ekal, atomic kaary main kisi semafor kaa pareekshan va usamen parivartan kar sakati he
 a mutex is a binary semaphore, which typically includes additional features such as proprietary or priority inversion protection

 Aesthetics is the representation of art, culture and nature
 saundaryashastra, darshanashastra kaa ek ang he
 It is also called Soundaryamimansa and Anandamimansa
 soundaryashastra vah shaastra he jisamen kalatmak kritiyon, rachanaaon aadi se abhivyakt hone vaala athwa unamem nihit rahane vaale saundarya kaa tathvik, darshanik or maarmik vivechan hota he
 The main purpose of this is to discuss the nature and nature of the joyful feeling in our mind by looking at a beautiful object and to coordinate it with other sensations of life
 saundaryashastra darshan kii ek shakha he jiske tahat kala, sahitya or sundarata se sambandhit prashnon kaa vivechan kiya jaataa he
 There is a word in the Greek language 'esthetico' which implies the derivation of 'esthetics', for the sense that is received by sense perception apart from the realm of knowledge
 prakruti, kala or sahitya se sambandhit clasical saundaryashastreey drushtikon viksit hua
 This approach keeps the political and contextual dimensions of the work out of the scope of the work, keeping its concern only with the beauty and art form
 lekin kala or sahitya vivechna kii kuch aisi vidhiyaan bhi hai jo kritiyon ke taatpary or unki rachana-prakriya ke saamaajik or aitihaasik pahaluon se samvaad sthapit karti hai
 Marxist aesthetics is one such discourse
 pracheen unani darshan main plato kii rachana hippiaz major main saundarya kii avadharana par charchaa milti he
 Aristotle's thoughts on the sad style of play in his poetics have influenced art-criticism for a long time
 kala or saundarya par hue gair-pashchimi pracheen chintan ke sandarbh main bharat ke naatyashaastra, abhinavgupt ke ras-siddhant or chini vidwaan cheng yin-yuvan kii rachana lee-tai ming-hua chi dwaara prastut anuthe or vistrut vimarshon kaa loha pashchimi jagat main bhi mana jaataa he
 non-western standards for interpreting this tradition of art-practice have not yet been formed, and interpretations made through Western standards have yielded unsatisfactory results

 This resulted in the formulation of the concept of fine arts by theorists
 alexander gottaleeb bomgaarten ne 1750 main esthetica likh kar ek bahes kaa sutarapaat kiya
 Seven years later, the emerging discourse of aesthetics was questioned by David Hume writing 'of the Standard of Tests'

 In this work, Kant insisted on universalizing the criterion of aesthetics
 lekin duusari ore ve kisi bhi tarah ke saarvbhaum saundaryashastra kii sambhaavna par andeh karte hue bhi nazar aaye
 Despite this contradiction, Kant's achievement was that he established some essential dialects to explore art and beauty
 in dvibhajanon main sarvaadhik ullekhneey hai : indriyabodh or tark-buddhi, sarawastu or rup, abhivyakti or abhivyakt, anand or upsanhaar, swatantraaa or aavashyaktaa aadi
 Kant's second achievement was that he distinguished between aesthetic experience and aesthetic experience
 unka kahana tha ki saundaryashastreey vyakhya or uski nishpatti vishleshan ke lakshya ke prati bina kisi vyaavhaarik aasakti ke hi kii jaani chahie
 The nineteenth century can be said to be a century of aesthetics
 kaant kii banaayi gayi zamin par hi baad main german vidwaanon ne saundaryashastra kaa vrihattar darshanik dhaanchaa khadaa kiya
 Hegel in his works Lectures on Esthetics, Schopenhaur in The World as Will and Representation and Nietzsche in Fine Births of Tragedy gave various interpretations of various aspects of Western aesthetics and published new dimensions
 unnisvin sadi ke aakiri daur main angrezi bhashi saundaryashastra main rupvaad kaa ubhaar hua
 Victorian Britain gave the slogan 'for the art of art', among whose spokespersons Oscar Wilde's name is notable
 vishuddh saundaryashastreey anubhav par bal dene vaale rupavaadi drushtikon ne lagbhag sabhi kshetron main aadhunik kala-roopon ko gaharaai se prabhavit kiya
 But the sounds of opposition to this movement were made by the great Russian litterateur Leo Tolstoy, What is Art? And narrated the work of John Dewey, the leading spokesman for American consequentialism, in Art as Experience
 tolstoy kaa tark tha ki jo kala manushyon ke bich naitik anubhutiyon kaa sampreshan nahin kar sakati, vah rupavaadi kasautiyon ke hisaab se kitni bhi mahaan kyon na ho, uski saraahna nahin kii ja sakati
 Divi also protested against art being cut from the structures of experience outside the realm of aesthetics in the name of aesthetics, taking ironics from the question of the role of communication

 Aesthetic theories were further enriched using tools of phenomenology, hermeneutics and Marxism
 1936 main martin haidagar ne ‘da orijan of da work of art’ jaisaa niabandh likhaa jise kala ke darshan kii sarvshereshth rachanaaon main se ek mana jaataa he
 Heidegger claimed in this essay that viewing art work as an object in this world is one of the fundamental semiotic errors of modernity
 hidagar ke mutabik kala to ek naye jagat ke dwaar kholti he, kala ke rup main satya apane-aap main ghatata hi nahin hamaare apane anubhav ke daayre main vastuon ke astitv kaa udghaatan bhi karata he
 In this way, through aesthetics, Heidegger criticized modernity and took on traditional existential epistemology and technological interpretation of things
 beesvin sadi ke madhya tak saundaryashastra kii upyogita par sawaal uthne lage
 In some of his lectures given at the beginning of the century, Edward Bulow had asked the question whether the definitions of art and beauty were eroding the creation-ability of the artist
 ye vyaakhyaan 1957 main chape or saath ke dashak main america kalakaar barnet newman ne elaan kar diya ki saundaryashastra kaa upyog kala ke liye vahi he jo pakshishastra kaa pakshiyon ke liye hai
 That is, an artist ignorant of aesthetics is good

 Pierre Bordeaux not only identified the ideological underpinnings of art under the sociology of culture, but also stated that aesthetics has not been able to establish its own cultural and political roots
 bordiyo ke is vichaar kaa pratwaad adorno kii rachana esthetic thiyari main miltaa he
 Adorno cites the example of twentieth-century non-standard art, saying that art still has the potential to counter ideology
 adorno ke mutabik kala apane samaaj kii upaj zarur hoti he, par uskaa rachana- prakriya main saamaajik niyatatvavaad se swytt kshan bhi nihit hota he
 Therefore, it also gives the artist and his audience or reader an opportunity to think in ways other than those used by the then dominant culture
 kuch marxvaadi vidwaanon ne saundaryashastra kii ek marxvaadi shrenee viksit karne kii koshish bhi kii he
 In view of such efforts from a critical point of view, the leading Marxist literary critic Namwar Singh of Hindi has considered the first example of this as the creation of 'socialist Realism' in the Soviet Union
 unhone kaha he, ‘shaastra banate hi saamaajik yatharth bhi sutarabaddh ho gaya or us yatharth ko abhivyakt karne kii style bhi
 a new formalism got under way, both in composition and in criticism
 jis desh ne samaajawaadee kranti kii, vah sahitya or kala ke kshetra main koi kranti karne se thithak gaya
 Such an insult to reality was not even in the literature before the revolution, and not even in the literature of the nineteenth century Europe when the Bourgeois Revolution gave rise to realism
 haalat bahut kuch hindi kii ritivaadee kahi janevaali sahitya-pravriti kii- si ho gayi, jab alankarishastra ke lakshan granthon ko saamne rakh kar kavitaayen likhi ja rahi thim
 ' namvar singh ne doosraa udhaaharan jorge lukach dwaara rachit saundaryashastra naamak vishaal granth kaa diya he
 He describes it as a monumental attempt by Lukach to finally compile his nearly sixty years of long literature into an orderly scripture, 'this huge text of thousands of pages is still available in the German language and which the Germans would know well, He will be able to say something confident about it
 angrezi main abhi tak uske bare main jo kuch kaha gaya he or uske chhitput anshon se jo abhas mila he uske aadhaar par itnaa to kaha hi ja saktaa he ki isamen samast kalaon ko ‘anukaran’ main nisshesh karne kii asafal cheshtaa kii gayi he
 In this way, when the Marxist Lukach goes on tying all the arts into one scripture, he is ultimately forced to go to Aristotle
 kisi angrezi saptahik ne is granth kii samiksha ke saath ek aisa cartoon chapa tha, jisamen lukach marks kii dadhi ke saath arestu kii shakl- surat or poshaak main pesh aate hai
 Namvar Singh believes that Lukach's parable reveals a weak aspect of this long tradition of Marxist aesthetics
 ve kehete hai ki ‘aksar vah swayan ‘kala’ naamak sanstha ko chunauti dene main chook gaya or kala kii clasiki paribhaasha ko sweekaar kar lene main use koi haani nahin dikhaai padi
 Once these definitions are accepted in the basic form, then with some manipulation, the work of evaluating this poet or work remains; And needless to say that Marxist aesthetics have demonstrated their talent in this field - competing with the biggest thinkers of high culture
 vyakhya or moolyankan kii bhashaa nishchay hi bhautikwaadi bhi he or aitihaasik bhi, lekin kul milakar vah prabhutvshaalee parampara se bahut alag nahin he
