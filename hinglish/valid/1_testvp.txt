'vishnugupt siddhant' naamak inkaa ek jyotish kaa granth bhi miltaa he
 It is said that he also has a book on Ayurveda called 'vaidyajivan'
 nyaay bhashyakaar vatsyayan or chanakya ko koi koi ek hi maanate hai, par yah bhram he jiskaa mul hemchand kaa yah shloke he: Thus the name of Kautilya has been associated with compositions called Dhatukautilya and Rajneeti
 kuch vidwaanon kaa yah maananaa he ki 'arthshaastra' ke alaava yadi kautilya kii anya rachanaaon kaa ullekh miltaa he, to vah kautilya kii sukhtiyon or kathanon kaa sankalan ho saktaa he
 Kautilya did not say anything explicitly about the origin of the state, but a few coincidental observations make it clear that he was in favor of a social settlement in place of the divine doctrine of the state
 hobbs, lock tathaa ruso kii tarah rajya kii utpatti se purv kii prakritik dasha ko vah araajaktaa kii sangya detaa he
 The state was born when, fed up with the law of 'fishery justice', people chose Manu as their king and agreed to give him one-sixth of their agricultural produce and one-tenth of gold
 iske badale main raja ne unki suraksha tathaa kalyaan kaa uttardaayitv sambhaala
 Kautilya is in favor of the monarchy
 kautilya ne paashchaatya raajnneetik chintakon dwaara pratipaadit rajya ke chaar aavashyak tattvon - bhoomi, jansankhya, sarkaar va samprabhutaa kaa vivaran na dekar rajya ke saat tattvon kaa vivechan kiya he
 In this regard, he does not give a definition of the state, but supports the already existing weekly theory
 kautilya ne rajya kii tulana maanav-sharir se kii he tathaa uske savyav rup ko sweekaar kiya he
 All the elements of the state work like organs of the human body inter-related, interdependent and together
 jansankhya main krishakon, udhyamiyon tathaa aarthik utpaadan main yogadan dene vaali praja sammilit he
 People should be loyal, hardworking and obeying the king's orders
 is prakaar kautilya kaa saptang siddhant rajya ke savyav swaroop kaa nirupan karte hue sabhi ango kii mahatvapurn bhoomika par prakaash daalata he
 Although this theory does not match the modern definition of the state, Kautilya's kingdom has all four elements of the modern state
 janapad bhoomi va jansankhya he, amaatya sarkaar kaa bhav he tathaa swami samprabhutta kaa pratik he
 The importance of the fund is in the administration, development and promotion and the army is necessary for internal peacekeeping and external security
 videshi maamalon main mitra mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he, kintu durg kaa sthaan aadhunik yug main suraksha-pratiraksha ke anya upkarnon ne le liya he
 Following the ancient Indian political thought, Kautilya has also made the concept of monarchy the center of his thinking
 vah loukik maamalon main raja kii shakti ko sarvopari maanata he, parantu karttavyon ke maamalon main vah swayan dharm main bandhaa he
 He is not a lecturer of religion, but a protector
 kautilya ne rajya ko apane aap main saadhy maanate hue saamaajik jivan main use sarvocch sthaan diya he
 The interest of the state is paramount for which at times it even outpaces the principles of morality
 kautilya ke anusaar rajya kaa uddeshy keval shaanti-vyavastha tathaa suraksha sthapit karnaa nahin, varan vyakti ke sarvocch vikaas main yogadan dena he
 According to Kautilya the functions of the state are- vahya shatruon tathaa akramanakariyon se rajya ko surakshit rakhana, aantarik vyavastha nyaay kii raksha tathaa daivi vipattiyon- baadh, bukamp, durbhiksh, aag, mahamari, ghaatak jantuon se praja kii raksha raja ke kaary hai
 Varnashrama Dharma has been emphasized under Swadharma
 yadhyapi kautilya manu kii tarah dharm ko sarvopari maanakar rajya ko dharm ke adheen nahin karata, kintu praja dwaara dharm kaa paalan na kiye jane par raja dharm kaa sangrakshan karata he
 The duty of the king is to establish social justice for the general public
 saamaajik vyavastha kaa samuchit sanchaalan tabhi sanmbhav he, jabaki pita-putr, pati-patni, guru-shishy aadi apane dayitvon kaa nirvaah karen
 In the event of divorce, he emphasizes equal rights of men and women
 strivadh tathaa brahman-hatya ko gambheer aparaadh mana gaya he
 The scope of Kautilya's kingdom is very wide
 vah rajya ko maanav ke bahumukhi vikaas kaa daayitv saunpkar use aadhunik yug kaa kalyankari rajya bana detaa he
 He has given many tasks to the state
 jaise- band, talab va sinchai ke anya sadhano kaa nirmaan, khaanon kaa vikaas, banjar bhoomi kii jutai, pashupaalan, vanyavikas aadi
 Apart from these, public entertainment was under the control of the state
 anathon nirdhanon, apango kii sahaayta, stri sammaan kii raksha, punakhravvaah kii vyavastha aadi bhi rajya ke daayitv the
 Thus Kautilya's kingdom is the ubiquitous state
 jan-kalyaan tathaa achche prashasan kii sthapana uskaa lakshya he, jisamen dharm va naitikta kaa prayog ek saadhan ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Kautilya says, ek anya sthaan par usne likhaa he
 In this regard, Salletore's statement is, "the only purpose of the state which has power and authority is to increase the happiness of its subjects
" is prakaar kautilya ne ek kalyankari rajya ke kaaryon ko uchit rup main nirdeshit kiya he
 '' kautilya ne na keval rajya ke aantarik kaary, balki vahya kaaryon kii bhi vistaar se charchaa kii he
 In this regard, he discusses foreign policy, international relations and rules of war and peace
 kootneeti ke sambandhon kaa vishleshan karne hetu usne mandal siddhant pratipaadit kiya he- Kautilya described the policy adopted by various states towards other states in his mandala theory
 pracheen kaal main bharat main anek chote-chote rajyon kaa astitv tha
 Powerful kings expanded their empire by war
 rajya kai baar suraksha kii drushti se anya rajyon main samjhauta bhi karte the
 According to Kautilya, a king who expanded his empire through war and conquest should increase the number of friends of his enemies, so that enemies can be kept under control
 duusari ore nirbal rajyon ko shaktishaalee padosi rajyon se satark rahanaa chahie
 They should form a group or 'mandal' to avoid expansionary policy of powerful states in association with states of equal status
 kautilya kaa mandal siddhant bhugolic aadhaar par yah darshata he ki kis prakaar vijay kii ichha rakhane vaale rajya ke padosi desh uske mitra yaa shatru ho sakate hai
 According to this theory, there is a king in the center of the mandal, who is willing to win other states, it is called "vijigishu"
 ‘‘vijigeeshu’’ ke maarg main aane vaala sabase pehla rajya ‘‘ari’’ tathaa shatru se laga hua rajya ‘‘shatru kaa shatru’’ hota he, atah vah vijigeeshu kaa mitra hota he
 Kautilya has also described "moderate" and "indifferent" states, which, despite being powerful, do not participate in the strategy
 kautilya kaa yah siddhant yatharthwaad par aadhaarit he, jo yudhon ko anterrashtriya sambandhon kii vaastaviktaa maanakar sandhi va samjhaute dwaara shakti-santulan banane par bal detaa he
 Kautilya has described six types of policies for conducting foreign relations - kautilya ke anusaar raja dwaara in nitiyon kaa prayog rajya ke kalyaan kii drushti se hi kiya janaa chahie
 Kautilya described the four principles of diplomacy with respect to the foreign policy of the state
 kautilya ke anusaar pratham do siddhanton kaa prayog nirbal raajaaon dwaara tathaa antim do siddhanton kaa prayog sabal raajaaon dwaara kiya janaa chahie, kintu uskaa yah bhi mat he ki sam daam se, daam bhed se or bhed dand se shreyaskar he
 Punishment should be used as a last resort, because it also causes damage to oneself
 kautilya ne guptcharon ke prakaaron va kaaryon kaa vistaar se varnan kiya he
 The undercover students could have been as homemakers, ascetics, businessmen and poisoners
 rajdoot bhi guptchar kii bhoomika nibhaate the
 Their task was to convey secret information of the country and abroad to the king
 ye janamat kii sthiti kaa aankalan karne, vidrohiyon par niyantran rakhane tathaa shatru rajya ko nasht karne main yogadan dete the
 Kautilya has suggested to keep the spies satisfied by giving them money and honor by the king
 logo ke jivan main mahapurushon ke vichaaro kaa kaaphi prabhaav hota he
 Chanakya's thoughts have also advanced the lives of many people
 chanakya kii kootneeti or iske sidhanto ke bare main kai pustake likhi gayi he
 There is a large section that reads Chanakya's life and follows it
 chanakya ke vichaaro ko anmol kaha jaataa he
 Chanakya's views are well liked by teachers, politicians and business people
 acharya chanakya kaa gauravshaalee vyaktitv ke bare main padhane se nai urja kaa sanchaar hota he
 Kautilya's thoughts are still inspiring
 yah satya he ki kautilya ne raashtra kii raksha ke liye gupt pranidhiyon ke ek vishaal sanghathan kaa varnan kiya he
 For Shatruksha, there is a law for poisonous, miscellaneous, ceremonial use, abhinaya mantra etc
 unethical and inappropriate measures and for the purpose of this great money expenditure and loss of money have also been declared in accordance with the national policy
 ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ main aisi charchaaon ko dekhakar hi mudrarakshaskaar kavi vishakhadutt chanakya ko kutilamati kaha he or banbhatta ne ‘kautilya arthshaastra’ ko ‘nirgun’ tathaa ‘atinrushanspryopadeshm’ kahkar nindit batalaaya he
 In a newly available historical work titled 'manjushree Moolakalp', Kautilya has been portrayed as 'durmati', Krodhan and 'papak', the character of Garha
 praachyavidya ke visheshgy anek aadhunik paashchaatya vidwaanon ne bhi uparyukt aniatik vyavasthaaon ko dekhakar kautilya kii tulana europe ke prasiddh lekhak or raajnneetijna mekiyavali se kii he, jisane apni pustak ‘da prince’ main raja ko lakshya-prapti ke liye uchit anuchit sabhi sadhano kaa aashray lene kaa upadesh diya he
 Western scholars, etc
 Western scholars demonstrate the following similarities between Kautilya and Mekiavali: kautilya tathaa mekiyavali main aisi sadrushta dikhaanaa yuktisangat nahin
 Of course, Kautilya was also a realist like Mekiavali and was not merely a follower of idealism
 parantu yah kahana ki kautilya ne dharm yaa naitikta ko sarvatha tilanjali de di thi, satyata ke vipareet hoga
 Kautilya established itself in the first tribunal of 'arthashastra'; arthath- raja praja ko apane dharm se chyut na hone de
 The king should also conduct his religion
 jo raja apane dharm kaa is bhaanti aacharan karata he, vah is lok or paralok main sukhi rahata he
 In this very first tribunal, emphasis has also been laid by the king on arranging immortals and orders have been given to strengthen varna and ashram system
 yahaan par trayee tathaa vaidic anushthan ko praja ke sangrakshan kaa mul aadhaar batalaaya gaya he
 Kautilya has described the king as the consort of elders from place to place, humble in learning, jitendriya and suppressor of the enemy-conspiracy etc
 aisa raja adharmik athwa atyaachaari banakar kis prakaar praja-peedan kar saktaa he ? iske vipareet raja ko praja ke liye pitru-tulya kaha gaya he, jo apni praja kaa paalan-poshan, sanvardhan, sangrakshan, bharan, shikshan ityadi vaisaa hi karata he jaisaa vah apni santaan kaa karata he
 It is right that Kautilya has also preached to take unethical measures for Shatruksha
 parantu is sambandh main arthshaastra ke nimna vachan ko nahin bhoolanaa chahie: That is, these diplomacy measures should be treated only with irreligious and wicked people, not with religious people
 kautilya kaa rajya-siddhant bhartiya raajnneetik chintan hetu mahatvapurn dein he
 He freed political science from the tendency to lean more towards righteousness
 yadhyapi vah dharm va naitikta kaa virodh nahin karata, kintu usne raajnneeti ko saadhaaran naitikta ke bandhanon se mukt rakhaa he
 From this point of view his ideas appear to be a pre-eminence of the ideas of European philosopher Machiavelli
 is aadhaar par use ‘‘bharat kaa maikayavali’’ bhi kaha jaataa he
 Selitore opines that it would be appropriate to compare Kautilya with Aristotle, as both tend to place more importance on the objectives of the state than on taking power
 yathartwaadee hone ke naate kautilya ne rajya ke vyavhaarik paksh par adhik dhyaan kendrit kiya he
 Although Kautilya's kingdom is supreme, he is not indifferent to public interest
 arjuna bigha main bharat ke bihar rajya ke antargat magadh mandal ke aurangabad jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Palasi is a village in Adilabadu district under the Andhra Pradesh state of India in the Talmadugu division

 While trying to rescue General Bakshi, Brigadier Shekhar Sharma succumbs to a fatal bullet
 apni mrityu par shekhar apane bete major ram prasad sharma ko sweekaar karte hai ki ram unka nazaij baccha he or unki patni or bete ne is bevafaayee ke kaaran kai saal pehle unhen chhod diya tha

 The Agni 6 is a four-stage intercontinental ballistic missile
 isak dizin charan ke puraa hone ke baad ab yah hardware ke vikaas ke charan main he
 Agni-6 is also likely to have several independently targeted re-entry vehicles as well as maneuverable re-entry vehicles

 It will be longer than its predecessor Agni 5 and is expected to fly the missile by 2017

 However, DRDO has completed all calculations and has started engineering
 yah agni mixilon main naveenatam or sabase unnat sanskaran hoga
 According to sources, the Agni 6 missile may have the capability to carry 10 MIRV weapons
 or 8,000 kimi se lekar 12,000 kimi kii ho sakati he
 However, the DRDO has refused to confirm the range of the missile
 diardio ke ek varisht vaigyanik ne yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya ki nai peedi agni-6 missile behad sahaj or aasaani se parivahan yogya hogi or aasaani se tainaat kii ja sakegi
 It will have the capability to launch from submarines and land based launchers
 2009 tak, yah bataaya gaya tha ki bharat sarkaar 10,000 kimi yaa isse adhik seemaa vaali antaramahadwipiya belistic missile ke vikaas par vichaar nahin kar rahi he
 The speculation of a program for a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile was resumed in 2011
 kuch reporton main daawa kiya gaya he ki antaramahadwipiya belistic missile kaa naam pehle se hi "surya" or naam code agni-6 he
 Other reports suggested that New Delhi was not serious about requiring intercontinental ballistics
 bharat sarkaar se anumati ke baad hi diardio bharat ke antaramahadwipiya belistic missile ko viksit karne ke liye ek pariyojna shuru kar saktaa he
 Since India was not a signatory to the missile technology control regime until 27 June 2016
 to bhartiya missile kaarykram antaramahadwipiya belistic missile kshamta ke vikaas ke liye kisi bhi sandhi patibaddhta dwaara simit nahin tha
 Some media reports sometimes reported that India being a non-signatory to the MTCR is a voluntary moratorium on the development of missiles beyond the 5000 km range
 missile praudyogiki niyantran vyavastha 5,000 kimi se pare mixilon ke vikaas se bharat ko nahin roktaa
 The MTCR prevents the transfer of missile technology to a different state so that missile technology proliferation does not increase
 yah sandhi praudyogiki ke hastantaran yaa ghatak ke sambandh main emticiar hastaksharkartaaon or gaiyr-emticiar hastaksharkartaaon ke bich antar nahin karata he

 The same report emphasized Russia's willingness to assist India in "seeker technology"

 Which Russia cannot do so easily
 vah missile praudyogiki niyantran vyavastha kaa ek sadsy desh he
 In response to the doubt, a top DRDO scientist said that India has all the tools and technology needed to develop icbms
 20 june 2011 ko, bhartiya raksha samachar ne10,000 kimi isibiem ke bare main bharat gambhir naamak ek lekh prakashit kiya jisamen kaha gaya he ki bharat apni ranneetik mixilon kii pahunch ko badhaane ke liye gambhirtha se vichaar kar rahaa he or raksha mantralay raksha mahasang ke prastaav par vichaar kar rahaa he ki intercantinental belistic missile 10,000 kilometre dur lakshya ko maarane main sakasham honi chahie
 The creation of an ICBM can have an international impact so the final decision of the proposal will be taken by the Cabinet Committee on Security
 april 2012 main, agni 5 ke safal prakshepan ke baad, saraswat ne khulaasa kiya ki bharat ke paas agni kaarykram ko band karne kii koi yojana nahin he or agni missile kii shrinkhalaa main or adhik mixilo kaa nirmaan ho saktaa hai
 In May 2012, reports confirmed the development of another ICBM Agni 6 missile in the Agni series
 yah kathith tha ki missile 2014 main viksit kii jaaegi or yah 8,000 kimi se lekar 10,000 kilometre tak se bhi lambii range kii ko sakati he
 Agni 6 will be attractive compared to Agni-5 and capable of aiming multiple targets at the same time, capable of carrying at least 10 nuclear warheads
 janvari 2013 main, diardio ke pramukh ve ke saraswavat ne kaha ki agni 5 ke vikaas ke baad, diardio agni 6 kaa vikaas karegi, jisamen kai swatantra lakshyikaran yogya pun: pravesh vaahan kshamta hogi

 While in Nalapat, she sometimes visited the Govindapuram temple there
 vahaan ke isht devtaa krishna hai
 His maternal uncle n Narayana Menon built a small temple along with the Nalapat house

 She used to perpetuate the work called 'devi Mahatmayam'

 There have been a lot of combative writers in all Indian languages along with senior writers like Balamani Amma
 in lekhikaon ke paas sahi muddon kii deshi or jaateey chetana kahin adhik gahari hai
 Amma is considered the best poet among Malayali poets
 ve darshanik tathyon or paariwarik jivan, donon kaa hi bakhubi chithran karti hai
 He has written dramatic dialogues by making mythological characters such as Parashurama, Vishwamitra, Vibhishan and Mahabali etc

 unke pati ne unhen sahitya srijan ke liye paryaapt avasar diya
 For their convenience, along with household chores, separate staff were employed to support the children, so that they could devote full time to writing

 calcutta-vas's experiences greatly influenced his poetic consciousness

 Mahatma Gandhi's influence became unavoidable for him during the independence movement
 unhone khaddar pahani or charkha kata
 


 Amma does not go far for enjoyment and nectar even for paternity, because: Truth is as far away as it is near, tad duré, tadu endike: The poet Manas says - Give me the power to / i enjoy i can also share the portions / others

 a decade later, he stepped out of the boundaries of home and family into the realm of spirituality
 tab tak yah kshetra unke liye aparichit jaisaa tha
 He got his initial knowledge of theosophy from his maternal uncle
 hindu shastron kaa sahaj gyaan unhen pehle se hi tha
 Therefore, the combined form of Theosophy and Hindu Manisha came in the form of his ideas in writing
 ammaa ke do darjan se adhik kavy-sankalan, kai gadhy-sankalan or anuwaad prakashit hue hai
 He started writing poems from a young age
 unki pehali kavita "kuppukai" 1930 main prakashit hui thi
 He was first conferred the "sahitya Kupuna Purasam" by Ram Varma Parikshit Thampuran, former ruler of the Cochin British Raj
 1987 main prakashit "nivedyam" unki kavitaaon kaa charchit sangrah he
 On the death of the poet NNN Menon, a collection of him as a mourning came from the name "lokanthangralil"
 unki kavitaayen darshanik vichaaron evam maanavtaa ke prati agaadh prem kii abhivyakti hoti hai
 He is referred to as "amma" and "dadi" in Malayalam-poetry because of his poetic love for children
 kerala sahitya academy, akhitam achyutan nambuthari main ek yaadgaar vaktavy ke dauraan unhen "maanav mahima ke nabi" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya tha or kavitaaon kii preranastrot kaha gaya tha

 The great work of n ॰ Narayana Menon called Kannuniratrulli Ashrubindu had a profound effect on Amma and helped her become a poetess
 mahakavi ve narayan menon unke mamaa en narayan menon ke samakaleen, maardarshak or ghanishtha mitra the
 Scholars like 'kuttikrishna Marar' and 'mukund Das' also used to come to his house
 ghar main saahitiyik charchaa kaa vaataavaran rahata tha
 She grew up in this environment
 sakshi or aswadika ke rup main ve vahaan upasthit rahati thim
 Mahakavi v Narayana Menon was one of the great poets in Malayalam literature who presented the mental sense of the human as a form of fantasy, which translated the Balmiki Ramayana in 1909
 1910 main "badhirvilapam" naamak vilaapkavy likhaa
 After that he wrote many dramatic expressions - Ganapathi, Bandhanasthanaay Anirudhan, Oru Kattu, Shishyunum Makanum, Magdalan Mari Yama, Achhukanum Makanum Kochusita etc
 san 1924 ke baad rachit sahityamanjariyon main hi vallattol ke deshbhakti se otprot ve kavyasuman khile the jinhone unako rashtrakavi ke pad par asin kiya
 Enre Gurunathan etc
 are highly popular in those expressions

 They did not have the tendency to stand and cry in darkness

 Part of his poetic courtesy can be seen in Amma's compositions
 ammaa kahati hai ki unke mamaa en narayan menon ke paas vishwa sahitya kii kai vishisht kritiyaan thim
 He was related to those works since childhood
 mahakavi rabindranath tagore krit 'di gardenar' or 'victor hugo krit 'las missrbalas' jaisi shreshth kritiyon se ve prabhavit hui thim, jo aage chalakar unki rachanaatmakataa ko dhar dene main sahaayak siddh hua
 Thus Amma has been highly influenced by Rabindranath Tagore, Victor Hugo, N
 Narayana Menon and V
 Narayan Menon in her literary life
 ammaa ne swatantraaa ke pehle kaa bharat bhi dekha or uske baad kaa bhi
 As a result, Amma, known as Vatsalya, Mamta, a poetess of the gentle spirit of humanity, tried to give a vision of the existential havoc, rudan within the then society, to be tested and compassionate, to overcome the darkness
 tees ke dashak kii unki kavitaaon main deshbhakti, gandhi kaa prabhaav or swatantraaa kii chaah spasht parilakshith hoti he
 During the Indian freedom struggle, he wore khaddar and spun spinning in his private life
 san 1929-39 ke bich likhi unki kavitaaon main deshbhakti or swatantraaa kii chaah spasht parilakshith hoti he
 Amma says that Gandhi was like a member of the Nalpat family
 unka agochar saannnidhya unhen unke har kriya-kalap ko prabhavit karata rahaa
 Then he was inspired to stay away from the pompousness
 ve narayan mendemma ke preranastrot Inspirators of Victor Hugoamma rabindranath tagoremma ke preranastrot Inspiration of Mahatma Gandhi apni aatmakathaatmak tippaniyon ke kram main ammaa ne sweekaar kiya he, ki kavy rachana ke kshetra main unke pati ve em nair ne unhen protsaahit kiya
 Their cooperation has received him continuously
 ammaa kahati hai ki- "I was not given a big responsibility in my in-laws' house
 bal-bacchon kii dekhbhaal, seva-tahal karne ke liye maan, daadi or sevikaayen thim
 Cooking is definitely a task, but that work never attracted me

 They used to criticize him

 " ammaa ek sansmaran sunaati hui kahati hai, ki- "there was a controversy over whether Kashmir is a part of India or Pakistan

 Patidev objected that my point of view that emerged in this poem does not seem appropriate for a nationalist

 When i meditated a lot, i understood that his statement was correct

 Since the formation of the LTTE around 1975, he was known as the head of the world's most powerful guerrilla fighters
 18 may 2009 ko srilanka kii sena ne unhen maarane kaa daawa kiya he
 Prabhakaran was born on 26 November 1954 in Velvettithurai, a coastal town in Jaffna Island, Sri Lanka
 vah apane mata-pita kii chauthi or sabase choti santan tha
 Prabhakaran was mediocre in studies
 bachapan main uskaa swabhaav sharmila or kitabon se chipke rahane vaale bachche ke rup main tha
 Velupillai Prabhakaran, who had been a ruthless movement for the last three decades to demand a separate Eelam in Sri Lanka, was a firm fighter, but his opponents saw him as an ambitious who never tolerated dissidents
 'thambi' ke rup main kukhyat prabhakaran ek sarkari adhikari kii chauthi santan tha, jisane bachapan main hi skool chhod diya tha

 In Sri Lanka, Tamil Hindus are a minority and Christians live in the majority

 Imagine how horrifically Tamilo would have been slaughtered
 isi atyaachaar ke virodh main valipilai prabhakaran ne littey {libresan tiger of tamil ilm } kaa nirmaan kiya
 Hindu Tamils survived only two ways, die as a victim of the atrocities of Christians and die the other way, fighting for the sake of self-respect
 hindu tamilo ne doosraa rasta chunaa or prabhakaran kaa saath dete hue shri lanka ke saath yuddh ched diya

 In response to which Prabhakaran kills Rajiv Gandhi
 agar us vakt prabhakaran kaa thoda bhi saath diya gaya hota to aaj hindu tamilo kaa ek alag desh hota or shri lanka se ji hajuri nahin kerani padati
 Because then the country of Tamils would have stood with us
 aaj bhi shri lanka main tamil hinduo ki sthiti dayaneey he
 Thambi sprang up in a small town in the northeastern region of Sri Lanka and introduced the 'tamil New Tiger' in 1972 with a group of young men to meet the demand for a separate 'homeland' for Tamils

 aaj bhi jab main ira ke bare main sochataa hum, to uski surat-shakl se zyada mujhe major solanki, bataraa, doctor or vimal yaad aate hai

 or mere saamne kashmir ke ve drishy aaj bhi gum jate hai jahaan ira ne mujhe yah bataaya tha
 Many times i tried to write this thing, which goes on in my heart, in the form of a story, but despite trying for the last three years, i could not write it
 aaj ise likhane baitha hum tab bhi is baat kaa yakeen nahin he ki ise puraa kar hi paaungaa, kyonki bahut sochane ke baad bhi main kisi nattejey par nahin pahunch sakaa, na main ira ko hi pahchaan sakaa
 It seems that i could do everything for him

 a polythene sheet was lying on everything

 The 'alpine Hotel' looked like a black mountain in a cloud covered with clouds

 suddenly light sparkled and spread out

 Only the feel of that light was enough

 In the same dreamy light, a monotonous shadow slowly emerged from the sleeping sea on the window panes

 The peaks of the steep hills around it were getting cleared up
 andheraa spirit kii tarah anjaane main udata ja rahaa tha
 The light of Ira's room was further cleaned

 That's when Ira made a gesture, but i was standing in a state of disarray 


 i couldn't even know when Ira placed a candle on the window's cornice, the flame of which, her hair shone like a beetle
 
 or ira kuch kshan baad taiyaar hone chali gai thi

 Hearing that, i entered the routie to get ready, after some time the horseman reached up and gave a voice, 'saab, sir!' maine nikalakar uskaa naam yaad karte hue poocha, ‘mamdu, ye badal dekh rahe ho ! aise main kitna thik hoga ?’ poochne ko to main puch gaya par laga ki kahin mamdu ne mausam kharaab ghoshit kar diya to ? main chaah rahaa tha ki mamdu kahe, sahab isse koi farak nahin padataa

 For a moment he looked at his fellow horsemen, recognized the feeling he had in the silence of his twinkling eyes, and thoughtfully said, 'nai Saab, it doesn't matter
 ’ maine apane man kaa utavlaapan chhipate hue usee par ahsaan ladaa, ‘tum kehete ho to thik he chalo !’ 'saab will remain in light rain! You will get rest
 ’ mamdu mere ahsaan ko utaarata hua bistar lapetane ke liye bheetar ghus gaya
 Just then, the boss of Ira's hotel brought tea, and after him, a laborer was approaching the horses, swinging like a bear with a bed of Ira on his back

 As soon as he placed his hands on her shapely silky shoulders, fingers were automatically folded from all around
 or kandhe se kuch neeche peeth par ve swatah sadsi kii tarah band ho jaati thim
 Ira's body shimmered like a wave and the essence of futile salvation came into the eyes and asked, what? And looking into them, questions and answers would come together at the same point

 Some people of the Khalsa Hotel were going along, what happened to them? Ira asked

 a resting place will be found in the guesthouse
 


maine ek raat aadu ke dak bangale main rukne kaa program banaaya he or ek raat liddervat ke dak bangale main, uske baad kolhai ! thik he na ? Arrived somewhere before! Ira said, then my mind broke, you took the bed unnecessarily
 


mere paas sab chizein extra hai
 i had some intention in this matter
 lekin ira ke chehre par kahin bhi sankoch nahin tha
 Don't know why, like ordinary women, there was no movement in such things, as if nothing is inappropriate

 Hearing, i realized my mistake and was hesitant

 She looked as free, free, free from above, perhaps as hesitant as she was from the inside, traditional and gentle

There is no desire to crush them by climbing on these smooth rocks, how can a man be a tilak? She was speaking while sitting in the shikara, jumping the water of the Dal like children, reaching the bottom of it, she would like to pour water

 It is the blame of these cruel eyes to drag the beautiful biography of Ira into Biyawan

 The newly-married couple stood in the dark near the railings or bushes with lights
 meraa man ho rahaa tha ki ira ko lekar udhar railing ke paas chalaa jaaun, jahaan apekshaakrit andhera tha
 i was beginning to feel so close
 ira kaa haath pakadakar main us andheri railing kii ore chal diya tha
 Such places do not even have to show segregation, because in these places the rites also happen
 railing par jhuke-jhuke dal ke pani main roshni ke chamakdaar sanpon ko laharaakar neeche kii ore jate hue dekhakar ira ne poocha tha, tilak, tum kab tak rukoge yahaan ? In Kashmir? i asked clearly, no matter for how long
 ira ne baat aage nahin badhaai
 i felt something bad
 pichley paanch dinon se main isi kashmakash main tha
 Despite such proximity our individual stands stood apart like palm trees; Whenever i used to talk, Ira would tell my old story - it is very dangerous to live in those settlements in Assam 


 i was afraid of standing at the window

 At this time, i was confused by the small question that Ira became silent

 She was staring down Solanki as if a victorious Rajput had returned
 uski yah baat sunakar meraa man hua ki kahuun-acha to main chalata hum
 But i kept staring at Solanki's horse who was still gasping
 solanki ne ghode se kudakar raasein chhodte hue dastaane utaare or overkot kii jeb se pipe nikaalkar tambaaku bharne laga
 While filling the pipe, he said, Our horseman was saying, Sir, it is now plain; Will walk late 


 Then looking at the horse, he said, If you run a horse on this mountainous path, the leg will break clearly 


 It is not the army, but the visitor is the money
 poni shabd par usne jor diya tha or hansaa tha phir pipe jalaate hue bolaa tha, taang kya khur tak nahin tutaa
 Saying this, he hit the horse's ankle with his military boot
 ghode ne chot se tilamila kar teen-chaar baar aise taang uthaai jaise sarakas main salaam kar rahaa ho
 The pipe was not yet burnt, Solanki spoke again while pressing his tobacco, it was only yesterday evening, stayed one night in Chandanwadi
 subah uthakar main bhaag aayaa, khachchar vaala or iskaa maalik peeche aa rahaa he
 Saying this, he stopped the pipe again and while removing a thin stream of smoke from his nostrils, said, "yes, if i say yes, i should go to Kolhai?" And then he gave me a first look
 ira ko meri upasthiti kaa jaisaa aksmaat gyaan hua to ekadam chaunkkar boli, are ye mistar tilak hai or aap major solanki
 Solanki shook and shook hands
 kaaphi jor, usne meraa haath daboch liya tha
 Delivering with great grace, i said, now you are coming from Chandanwadi, you must be tired
 ira kii drushti main sahmati or asahmati donon hi thim ki kash lekar dhuaan ugalate hue solanki ne kaha, nahin, nahin, bilkul nahin
 And the smoke was wrapped around it, as if it had covered transparent plastic wax

 Pranayama = Prana + Dimension
 iskaa kaa shabdic arth he - 'praan ko lambaa karnaa' yaa 'praan ko lambaa karnaa'
 In the Hathayogapradipika it is said- yah bhi kaha gaya he- Pranayama is made up of the sum of two words - the first word is "prana" and the second is "dimension"
 praan kaa arth jo hamen shakti detaa he yaa bal detaa he
 To know the meaning of dimension, it has to be severed because it is made up of the sum of two words
 isamen mul shabd '"yam" ' he 'aa' upsarg laga he
 The meaning of yam is 'motion' and the prefix "aa" is used in the sense of 'inverted', that is, dimension means inversion
 atah pranayam main aayam ko 'ulataa gaman ke arth main prayog kiya gaya he
 Thus Pranayama means' the reverse movement of Prana
 yahan yah dhyaan dene ki baat he ki pranayam praan ke ulataa gaman ke vishesh kriya kii sangya he na ki uskaa parinaam
 That is to say, the word pranayama should indicate the specific action of life
 pranayam ke bare main bahut se rishiyon ne apane-apane dhang se kaha he lekin sabhi ke bhav ek hi he jaise patanjali kaa pranayam sutara evam gita main jisamen patanjali kaa pranayam sutara mahatvapurn mana jaataa he jo is prakaar he- tasmin sati shwasaprashwasayorgativiched:pranayam
 iskaa hindi anuwaad is prakaar hoga- shwaas prashwaas ke gati ko alag karnaa pranayam he
 According to this sutra, for doing pranayama, first of all there should be a proper interpretation of the sutra, but before interpreting the pranayama sutra of Patanjali, we should note that Patanjali compiled the activities and upanayas of yoga in a book called Yogasutra
 Has done and the meaning of the formula is - a certain rule which is mathematic and scientific
 yadi sutara kii sahi vyakhya nahin hui to uttar satya se dur evam parinaam shunya hoga
 If you want to do pranayam according to Patanjali's pranayama sutra, then first of all, his pranayama sutra tasmin sati svasprashapyayogaartivakshya: pranayama॥ There should be a proper interpretation that is scriptural, scientific, logical, and mathematical
 isi vyakhya ke anusaar kriya karnaa hoga
 For this, the words used in the sutra should be understood and the special strategy of breaking the motion given in it has to be known
 iske liye patanjali ke pranayam sutara main prayukt shabdo kaa arth bodh hona chaiye
 Breathing at a slow speed, stopping and exhaling comes in the order of pranayama
 shwaas khinchne ke saath bhaavana karen ki praan shakti, shreshthata shwaas ke dwaara andar khinchi ja rahi he, chhodte samay yah bhaavana karen ki hamaare durgun, dushpravritiyaan, bure vichaar prashwaas ke saath baahar nikal rahe hai
 When we breathe, we do not just draw air, then we pull all the energy of the universe with it
 ab aapako lagegaa kii sirf saans khichne se aisa kaisaa hoga
 The breath that we draw in the lungs is not just breathing, it contains all the energy of the whole universe
 maan lo jo saans aapke puure sharir ko chalaanaa janati he, wo aapke sharir ko durust karne kii bhi takat rakhti he
 Pranayama should be done with the following chant
 bhuh bhuvah swah mahah, janah tapah satyam
 ॐ Tatsviturvarnayanam bhargo devasya dhimhi dhiyo yo na prachodayat
 apojyotirsomritan, brahm bhurbhuvah swah 
 Pranayama has great importance in yoga
 sukhasana, siddhasana, padmasana, vajrasana main baithen
 Fill the long breath in the lungs with the nose, then leave the long breath through the lungs
 Keep the same pressure while breathing and exhale
 hamen hamaari galtiyaan sudharni he, ek to ham puri saans nahin lete; or doosraa hamaari saans pet main chali jaati he
 See there are two ways in our body, one and the other
 Just as the lungs have a system of purifying the air, the stomach does not
 usee ke kaaran hamaare sharir main oxygen kii kami mahasoos hoti he or usee ke kaaran hamaare sharir main rog judate he
 Sit in Sukhasana, Siddhasana, Padmasana, Vajrasana and while throwing the breath out, you have to push the stomach inward, just keep breathing in it
 do sanson ke bich apane aap saans andar chali jaayegi, jaan-boojh kar saans ko andar nahin lenaa he
 Kapal says the front part of the brain, Bhati says Jyoti, Kanti, Tej; By continuously doing Kapalbhati Pranayama, the beauty of the face increases
 kapaalbhaati pranayam dharti kii sanjivani kehalaata he
 While doing Kapalbhati Pranayama one has to focus on the Muladhara Chakra
 isse muladhar chakra jaagrath ho kar kundlini shakti jaagrath hone main madad hoti he
 While doing Kapalabhati Pranayama, it is to think that all the negative elements of our body are going out of the body
 khaanaa mili naa mili magar roj kam se kam 5 minutes kapaalbhaati pranayam karnaa hi he, yah drudh sanklop karnaa he
 Sit in Sukhasana, Siddhasana, Padmasana, Vajrasana
 saans ko puri tarah baahar nikaalane ke baad saans baahar hi roke rakhane ke baad teen bandh lagaate hai
 1) Jalandhar Bandh: - By shrinking the neck completely, keep the chin close to the chest
 2) uddyaan bandh :- pet ko puri tarah andar peeth kii taraf kheenchna he
 3) Basic bandage: - The place of excretion of our feces has to be pulled completely upwards
 sukhasana, siddhasana, padmasana, vajrasana main baithen
 The beginning and the end always have to be done with the left nostril, close the right nostril of the nose and take a long breath from the left, then close the left, exhale long breath from the right one


 Now take a long breath from the right and leave the left one
 


 That is, keep this sequence right-to-left-left, repeat this process for 10-15 minutes
 While breathing, you should concentrate on the command cycle located between the two eyes
 or man hi man main saans lete samay - kaa jaap karte rahanaa chahie
 Our body's 72,72,10,210 micro pulse are purified
 baanyi naadee ko chandra nadee, or baanyi nadee ko surya naadee kehete hai
 The cold air enters from Chandra Nadi and the hot air from Surya Nadi goes inside
 thandi or garam hawa ke upyog se hamaare sharir kaa taapmaana santulit rahata he
 This increases our immune power
 sukhasana, siddhasana, padmasana, vajrasana main baithen
 Close the ears completely with both the thumbs, place two fingers on the forehead and put six fingers on both eyes
 or lambii saans lete hue kanth se bhavaren jaisaa aawaaj nikaalnaa he
 Sir, i have come to the conclusion after continuous practice of the last five years: - If you start breathing in the Anulom Antonym Pranayama, if you start breathing from right nostril and finally from right nostril then anger and irritation persists in the mind! And conversely, if the breath is started from the left nostril and at the end the breath is exhaled from the left nostril then the mind remains calm! sukhasana, siddhasana, padmasana, vajrasana main baithen
 And with the mother-in-law, you have to chant Oum with your mouth
 sukhasana, siddhasana, padmasana, vajrasana main baithen
 And sitting silently in the mind, taking long breaths and chanting Oum
 sukhasana, siddhasana, padmasana, vajrasana main baithen
 It is not like Kapalbhati Pranayama in action, do not breathe out again and again
 saas ko puri tarah baahar nikal ke baad baahar hi roak ke pet ko aage peeche karnaa he
 Sit in Sukhasana, Siddhasana, Padmasana, Vajrasana
 sikude huve gale se saas ko andar lenaa he
 Sit in Sukhasana, Siddhasana, Padmasana, Vajrasana
 jiva taalu ko lagaake dono jabade band karke lenaa or us choti si jagah se si si karat hue hawa ko andar khichna he
 And by closing the mouth, leave the breath out of the nose
 jaise e• si• ke phins hote he, usase e• si• ke kanmpressor par kam dabaav aata he or garam hawa baahar phekane se hamaari kaksha kii hawa thandi ho jaati he
 In the same way, we can reduce the excess heat of our body
 sukhasana, siddhasana, padmasana, vajrasana main baithen
 With the shape of our mouth "0", take out the organism from it, our living will also become "0", the air has to be drawn from the same part
 or munh band karke se saans ko naak se baahar chhod de
 Sit in Sukhasana, Siddhasana, Padmasana, Vajrasana
 hamaare munh kaa " 0 " aakaar karke usase jiva ko baahar nikaalnaa, hamaari jivha bhi " 0 " aakaar kii ho jaayegi, usee bhaag se hawa andar khichni he
 And by closing the mouth, leave the breath out of the nose
 sukhasana, siddhasana, padmasana, vajrasana main baithen
 With the shape of our mouth "0", take out the organism from it, our living will also become "0", the air has to be drawn from the same part
 or munh band karke se saans ko naak se baahar chhod de

 christaani europea "sabhyon" ke anusaar "asabhy" mul nivaasiyon ko "sachche dharm" main dikshit kar sabhy banane kaa ekmaatr maarg unhen das bana lenaa tha or sabhy banane kii is prakriya main sab kuch kshamya tha
 Around 1510, when the first ship laden with African Habshi slaves reached the New World, there was a new turning point in the history of slavery
 mulnivaasee das kabhi kabhi apni vidrohi gatividhiyon ke kaaran shwet mahaprabhuon kaa saradard ban jate the or saath hi spain evam portugal ke raja tathaa dharmaguru bhi un daason ke prati sahishnutaa baratane kii charchaa karne lag jate the
 These new Habshi slaves were more obedient and hard-wired than the indigenous slaves, which was the main reason for these Habsis to cross the seven seas away from their African homeland
 at: habshiyon kii maang badhane lagi
 Slave labor in sugarcane, cotton fields and mines became even more useful than before
 falat: habshiyon kaa aayaat itnaa badha ki sheeghra hi pashchimi dweepasmoohon main unka bahumat ho gaya
 Under the aegis of greedy European powers, there was such fierce competition among the private companies of slave trading that by the early 18th century the Habshi slave trade reached its culmination
 angrej to is kaam main rani elizabeth ke kaal main hi nipun ho chuke the kyonki rele, gilbert, hakins tathaa drek jaise vyakti apharan, luutmaar aadi tareekon se dasavyapaar chalaakar england ko samrudh bana rahe the
 Habshis were taken in return for goods and taken like animals in ships and transported across the Atlantic to America
 vahaan unhen bechakar chini, kapaas, chaaval tathaa sone se laden jahaaj europe lautate the
 In fact slavery is a major basis of England, America and European capitalism
 ek anumaan ke anusaar san 1680-1786 ke bich lakh habshiyon ko atlantik paar le jaaya gaya
 These slaves also had to accept the language and religion of their various European masters as they could only get opportunities to keep their cultural heritage alive in that hell
 aatmahatya yaa palaayan ke alawa mukti ke koi maarg na the
 Habshi Das could not even imagine contact with white women when white masters had sex with Habshi
 kintu varnsankar santaanen kuch apwaadon ko chhodkar daastaa kaa hi str praapt karti thim
 Habshi slaves used to have very pathetic and poor food
 das jhundon ke shwet nireekshak kheton yaa khaanon main kaam karaate samay unpar chabukon kaa khulkar prayog karte the
 Habshi slavery and exorbitant conditions have been of special importance in the history of North America and especially of the United States from the beginning to the present day
 daspratha ke kaaran hi vahaan tambaakoo, kapaas aadi kii krishi main ascharyajanak pragati hui tathaa bhoomi se apratyaashit khanij sampatti nikaali gai; dasavyavastha ne hi sanyukt rajya ko poonjeewaadi tathaa audyogic pragati main vishwa kaa agua banane main sabase adhik sahaayta di he; tathaa daspratha ne hi sanyukt rajya ke raajnneetik itihaas main sabase mahatvapurn prabhaav daalaa he kyonki daastaa ke prashn par ukt raashtra bheeshan grihayuddh se guzarakar vibhajit hote hote bachaa he
 Although slavery was previously declared illegal in the United States, even today the biggest national problem there is the Habshi problem, which is not being fully resolved
 yah unheen habshiyon kii samasya he jinke parvaj shwet mahaprabhuon ke kritadas the
 In the 18th century in the United States, when there was some possibility of rebellions of the Habshi, it was legally forbidden for the Habsis to carry weapons, drum drums and take to the streets at night
 jab virginia main, jo sanyukt rajya main kaale daason kaa pracheenatam tathaa vishaltam centre tha, net turnar naamak das padri ke netritv main ek chota vidroh hua to das rajyon main habshiyon ko padhanaa-likhnaa sikhaanaa bhi avaidhanik ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Apartheid has been the predominant feature of slavery in the United States
 yadhyapi prarambh main daason par bhayaavah atyaachaar hote the or unhen asahneeya ksht uthaane padate the, phir bhi dhire-dhire unke prati adhik udaartaapurna vyavhaar kiya jane laga
 If a slave was tortured and mistreated in Athens, he could demand to be sold to another owner
 uske swami ko yah adhikaar na tha ki jab ichha ho tab uske praan le le
 Even after killing someone in the owner's family, his master did not have this right
 saamanyatya nyaayalay main mukadmaa chalaae bina use prandand nahin diya ja saktaa tha
 It took longer to improve their location in Rome
 vahaan das ke praan le lene kii puri chhot swami ko thi
 He did not have the right to marry
 bahut se daason ko aksar raat main zanjeeron se baandhakar rakhaa jaataa tha
 Gradually, this situation improved slightly
 kuch maalikon ne apane bacchon kii acchhee tarah dekhbhaal karne par daason ko swatantra kar dene kaa aashwaasan dena shu degree kiya or kuch ne unhen nirdhaarit avadhi tak kadi mehnat karne par chhod dene kaa vachan diya
 According to the law, it was allowed to sell children as slaves and anyone was banned from making slaves to pay debts
 pashchim main daspratha unmoolan sambandhi vaataavaran 18veen shatee main banane laga tha
 Man liberty was a major slogan of the American Independence War, and as a result, in the northern states of the United States, by 1804, the French state revolution, which had a strong allegiance to human fundamental rights, is more important in creating an anti-slavery environment
 us mahaan kranti se prerana paakar san 1821 main santo domingo main spain ke viruddh vidroh hua or haiti ke habshi ganraajya kii sthapana hui
 The anti-slavery movement began to prevail in all countries of the American continents
 sanyukt rajya america ke udaaravaadi uttar rajyon main daastaa kaa virodh jitna prabal hota gaya utani hi pratikriyaavaadi dakshin ke das rajyon main daason ke prati kathorta barti jane lagi tathaa yah tanaav itnaa badha ki antat: uttari tathaa dakshini rajyon ke bich grihayuddh chhid gaya
 This war led to the victory of the anti-slave solidarity northern states under the leadership of Abraham Lincoln
 san 1888 ke adhinium ke anusaar sanyukt rajya main daastaa par khadey portugali brazil samrajya kaa patan hua
 Shani: Shani: Slavery began to be eradicated from all countries of the American continent
 1890 main brussels ke 18 deshon ke sammelan main habsh daason ke samudri vyapaar ko avaidhanik ghoshit kiya gaya
 The proposal for complete abolition of all forms of slavery and slavery was signed by all the major countries in the 1919 Saint Germain Conference and under the aegis of the League of Nations of 1926
 british adhikrut pradeshon main san 1833 main daspratha samaapt kar di gai or daason ko mukt karne ke badale main unke maalikon ko do karod pound harajaana diya gaya
 Legislation in other countries ended in these years - India 1846, Sweden 1859, Brazil 1871, African Protected States 1897, 1901, Philippine 1902, Abyssinia 1921
 is prakaar 20veen shatee main praaia: sabhi rashtron ne daastaa ko amanviya tathaa aniatik sanstha maanakar uske unmoolnarth kadam uthaae
 Presumably, except for two exceptions, like the Portuguese colonies of Angola in Africa, there is no institutional existence of the dreaded slave system that has been the mainstay of the prosperity and splendor of today's Western civilization

 Scholars have named the first period of the history of Hindi literature as follows- acharya ramchandra shukla ne is kaal kaa naam virgatha kaal rakhaa he
 Explaining the basis of this nomenclature, he writes- 


 Within the first half-hundred years of this long tradition of time, no particular tendency of creation is decided - all kinds of creations, religion, policy, adornment, heroic They meet in couplets
 is anirdisht lok pravriti ke uparaant jab se musalamaanon kii chadhaaiyon kaa aarambh hota he tab se ham hindi sahitya kii pravriti ek vishesh rup main bandhati hui pate hai
 Rajaashrita poets used to describe the mighty characters or gathas of their inherited kings
 yahi prabandh parampara raso ke naam se paayi jaati he, jise lakshya karke is kaal ko hamane virgatha kaal kaha he
 In this context, they give three reasons - dow grearsan ne hindi sahitya ke itihaas ke pratham kaal ko charankaal naam diya he
 But they have not been able to give any concrete argument in favor of this name
 unhone hindi sahitya ke itihaas kaa prarambh 643 i
 se maani he kintu us samay kii kisi chaaran rachana yaa pravriti kaa ullekh unhone nahin kiya he
 In fact, these types of compositions date back to 1000 CE

 This name is also not acceptable to scholars
 doramkumar verma- inhone hindi sahitya ke praarambhik kaal ko charankaal naam diya he
 Regarding this nomenclature, he says that all the poets of this period were Charan, this fact cannot be denied
