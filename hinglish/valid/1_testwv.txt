 jise 30 sitambar, 2014 ko pradarshit kiya gaya va oktober 2014 main yah bazaar main aayaa
 a glimpse version was already available
 vah sabhi iskaa purna sanskaran bhi downlod ke dwaara le sakate hai
 It is providing free of cost to customers purchasing its earlier operating system 7,8 etc
 gduxng jkl yah windos 7 va 8 ke kuch visheshtaon ke saath-saath kuch nae visheshtaon ko jod kar banaaya gaya he
 It opens more quickly than other operating systems
 isamen kai prakaar kii suvidha nahin hoti he
 For this, you have to download that content from Microsoft website
 yah lagbhag sabhi anuprayog se internet kaa hi upyog karata he
 All its applications, except a few, can be run by the Internet itself
 yani aapako internet kii suvidha leni hi hogi
 If you take service of internet then it keeps downloading many new files like language, font, new version of application etc
 by internet at any time
 is kaaran yah data bahut zyada letaa he
 It has very few applications compared to Windows 7
 jo internet se chalate hai unhen chhod diya jaae to sabhi windos 7 ke hi anuprayog milenge
 The rest of the applications do not work without internet
 iske alaava khel vaale anuprayog main keval ek hi khel he
 While Windows 7 had many game applications
 isamen windos 7 ke kuch upyogi anuprayog ke alaava sabhi anuprayog internet par aadhaarit he
 That too all applications are created by Microsoft and run with the same accounts
 iske lagbhag sabhi nai visheshta keval internet ke dwaara hi upyog kii ja sakati he
 If you do not have internet facility, you cannot use its many features
 isamen yah bevajaah bhi internet letaa rahata he
 Even if you use the Internet, it keeps downloading new files etc
 to keep Windows new
 isamen andar ke kai panno main bhi internet se kai vastu aate rahete hai
 It also shows advertisements in some applications via the Internet
 iske pehle se sthapit har anuprayog main internet kii aavashyaktaa saaf jhalkati he
 The user's image which is also visible while starting it, can also be connected to the Internet
 jahaan fil ko rakhaa jaataa he, vahaan bhi internet ke liye suvidha di gai he
 With which you can insert your file into Microsoft
 isamen yah itane adhik sthaan par he ki koi bhi isamen ja saktaa he
 The most annoying thing is that no application asks for your consent to use the Internet
 yahan tak kii windos ke kai andar ke panne jo windos 7 yaa ekspe aadi main internet nahin lete the
 Now they also use the internet without saying anything
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi aap bhashaa badalane ke panne par jaayenge to yah apane aap hi us bhashaa ke liye font, likhane aadi ke alaava kai baar ek se adhik baar bhi khojataa he, vah bhi bina dikhaaye kii vah internet kaa upyog kar rahaa he
 Apart from this, open many pages, but the application or content associated with that page automatically starts taking internet
 arthath yadi aapke paas internet ke liye nickshulk data he to hi aap internet kaa puraa upyog kar sakate ho yadi data niyat he to isse data hi samaapt ho jaataa he
 Including Cool you will not get any page or facility that does not ask you to use the Internet
 microsoft ne yah saaf kaha he ki isamen vah upyogkarta kii jaankaree lete rahata he
 Even if you want, you can only change the size of the information in it
 isamen microsoft aapke dwaara kharide gaye anuprayog se lekar aap kis kis jagah par jate hai aadi jaankaree bhi letaa rahata he
 This is the main reason for taking internet from it
 yah jaankaree main aapke vyaktigat fil aadi ko bhi apane paas bhejtaa he
 Microsoft has also said that if one does not accept this condition, then one should not use it
 yadi vah iskaa upyog karata he to uskaa arth hota he ki vah hamaare sharton ko maanata he
 Older applications that work well in Windows 7 or XP etc
 do not function properly in this operating system
 iske saath hi kai anuprayog ko sthapit karte samay truti dikhaai detii he or vah sthapit nahin ho pate hai
 Many browsers etc
 appear to be disturbed in the upper part
 iske liye nae brouzar kaa upyog hi karnaa padataa he
 By this it shows Microsoft's store from where you can download new applications
 jisamen nickshulk anuprayog main microsoft dwaara vigyaapan dikhaaya jaataa he or anya anuprayog ke liye aapako paise dene honge
 Content shortages such as Windows 7 had a variety of images and videos
 lekin isamen vah sabhi nahin he
 Apart from this, there is a lack of pictures in its other place as well
 chunki isamen windos 8 ke bhi gun hai is liye iske kai chhavi kaale or safed rang main hi hoti he
 Which can change color according to the subject
 microsoft ke anya pichley sanskaran main jis tarah se kisi bhi anuprayog va vikalp aadi ke liye saral maarg tha
 That kind of route is not in Windows 10
 isamen kai anuprayog ke vikalp windos 7 ke anuprayog kii tarah dikhte hai or kuch windos 10 kii tarah
 There are many ways to get to the same page
 vah bhi alag-alag naamon se is kaaran yah samaj nahin aata kii aap kab kis sthaan par aa gaye ho
 It has all the feature changing pages in very different places
 is kaaran sahi tareeke se upyog karne main pareshaani aati he
 The confusability is increased due to its multiple application having almost the same function
 aap jis bhashaa main windos praapt karoge uske alaava usamen anya bhashaa ke liye samarthan nahin he
 For example, if you can get Windows 10 in English, then you will have to download support for Hindi or other language
 iske aapako koi or bhashaa ke akshar bhi dekhne ke liye font ko downlod karnaa padegaa
 It requires download to write etc
 lekin yadi aap angrezi ke alaava koi or bhashaa main ise praapt karte hai to aapako us bhashaa or angrezi ke liye pehle se samarthan rahegaa
 While such support already exists in the older version

 During this period, social reformers, writers and artists challenged the established traditions related to women, marriage, dowry, caste system and religion
 bengal ke is ghatnakram ne samgr bhartiya aadhuniktaa kii nirmitiyon par amit chhap chodi
 It was during this renaissance that structures of the earliest forms of Indian nationalism emerged
 bengal ke navajagaran kaa vistaar raja rammohan raay se armbh hokar rabindranath thakur tak mana jaataa he
 Historian Sushobhan Sarkar, who conducted a systematic study of this period, writes, 'english rule, capitalist economy and modern western culture had its first impact on Bengal, which led to a renaissance which is commonly known as the Renaissance of Bengal
 kareeb ek sadi tak badalati hui aadhunik duniya ke prati bengal kii sachet jaagrukta shesh bharat ke mukaable aage rahi
 In this context, it can be said that the role played by Bengal in the modern awakening of India can be compared to the role of Italy in the context of European Renaissance
 ’ italvi rinesaan kii hi tarah bengal kaa navajagaran koi janandolan nahin tha
 Its process and spread was limited to Bhadralok
 bhadralok main bhi navajagaran kaa prabhaav adhiktar uske hindu hisse par hi padaa
 Some Muslim personalities also emerged during this period, but the renaissance of Bengal can be partly called the Muslim Renaissance
 mote taur par mana jaataa he ki bengal ke navajagaran kii shuruyaat rammohan raay se hui or rabindranath thakur ke saath uskaa samaapan ho gaya
 The Sushobhan government has tried to divide it into five stages: the first period 1814 to 1833, whose central figure was Raja Rammohan Roy
 1814 main ve kolkata rahane ke liye aaye or 1833 main unka landan main dehanth hua
 The second period goes from his death to the Revolt of 1857
 teesri avadhi 1885 main bhartiya rashtriya congress kii sthapana tak faili hui he
 The fourth period dates back to the partition of Bengal in 1905 and the fifth period from the Swadeshi movement to the non-cooperation movement and the beginning of Mahatma Gandhi's leadership i

 rammohan raay ke bare main ek drushtaant he jise unki shakhsiyat ke roopak kii tarah padhaa ja saktaa he
 He is said to have had two houses
 khan-paan, veshbhusha or rahan-sahan ke lihaaz se ek main kisi victorian jentilmen kii bhanti rahete the or duusare main parmparik bengali brahman kii tarah
 Indeed, the greatest feature of his personality and work was the synthesis of East and West
 lekin, yah drushtaant bhi unke roodhibhanjak vyaktitv ko paribhaashit nahin karata
 In 1820, his work 'percepts of Jesus' was published in which the moral message of Jesus was separated from Christian philosophy and miracle tales
 bengal main sakriy isai padri varg unki is koshish se naaraaz ho gaya
 As a result of his opposition, Rammohun Roy gave more clarity to his views by issuing three appeals to the Christian public
 isi ke saath unhone brahmanical megazin kaa prakaashan karke hindu aastikta ke vaicharik nairantary ko vedon ke hawaale se rekhaankit karne kii cheshtaa bhi kii
 On 20 August 1828, Rammohan formed the 'brahma Sabha' to bring his religious ideas to earth
 is prakriya kaa parinaam 1830 main ek carch kii sthapana ke rup main niklaa or brahm samaaj andolan shuru hua jo lambe samay tak bengali samaaj kii chetana ko prabhavit karata rahaa
 Between 1818 and 1829, Rammohun Roy published three compositions attacking the evil like the practice of sati
 sati pratha ke kilaaf janamat banane or angrezon ko us par pratibandh lagane ke liye manaane kaa shrey unke prayaason ko hi diya jaataa he
 Rammohan played a pioneering role in the spread of modern education and especially female education
 unhen bangla gadhy kaa nirmaataa bhi kaha jaataa he
 Rammohan's efforts faced double opposition in this phase of Bengal Renaissance
 ek taraf unka virodh radhakant deb, gaurikant bhattacharya or bhavani charan banerjee jaise sudhaar virdohi paramparanishth lekhak or vidwaan kar rahe the, vahiin unhen francisi kranti or inglish radicalizam se anupranit aalochana kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa jiskaa netritv ‘yang bengal’ or uske anglo-indine netaa henry vivian derozio ke haathon main tha
 It is a different matter that Derozio's followers were not able to make any lasting impact other than shocking the society with their works and oratory
 lekin, rammohan kii parampara ke aadhaar par samaaj sudhaaron kaa naram kaarykram unki mrityu ke baad bhi jari rahaa
 He was commanded by Devendranath Thakur and Akshay Kumar Dutt

 1873 main vishabruksh ke zariye unhone saamaajik upanyaason kii parampara kaa sutarapaat kiya
 By writing an essay titled 'samya' in 1879, Bankim showed a tendency towards egalitarianism and utopian socialism, but by writing Anandamath in 1882, he was swept away by a wave of patriotic revivalism
 isi rachana main darj ‘vandemataram’ geet bharat ke teen raashtragiton main se ek he
 Along with literary innovation, the Bengali Renaissance also heralded the tradition of contribution to historiography and other fields of sociology
 dharmik sudhaaron or punarutthanavaad ke lihaaz se bhi yah daur khaasaa ghatnaprad tha
 On the one hand, under the leadership of Keshav Chandra Sen, young Brahm was awakening in the Samaj reform movement, on the other hand, the Wahhabi dissent was seething and the footsteps of neo-hinduism were being heard
 isi avadhi main dakshineshwar ke sant ramakrishna paramhans ne apane chumbakeey vyaktitv ke madhyam se sabhi dharmik aasthaaon ko pavitra ghoshit kiya
 Protestant extremism that fueled Christian conversion weakened it and gave little relief to the advocates of the tradition

 a variety of activities were led by Rajnarayan Bose, Navagopal Mitra, Jyotirindranath Thakur and Bhudev Mukherjee, notable for organizing the Hindu fair which has been critical of Kolkata for nearly ten years
 1870 ke baad kii avadhi raajnneetik andolanon kii avadhi thi jisamen surendranath banerjee kaa netritv ubhara jinhen ‘bengal ke betaj ke badshaah’ ke taur par janaa gaya
 Due to the militant cause of Surendranath, the British spoiled his name and also called 'surrender not' Banerjee
 1876 main banerjee ne ‘indine association’ kii sthapana kii jiske 1883 ke rashtriya sammelan main sabhi bharatiyon ke liye ek rashtriya sanghathan banane kaa vichaar paidaa hua
 This resulted in the historic founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885
 bengali buddhijiviyon congress kii gatividhiyon main jam kar bhagidaari kii or 1903 tak congress adhiveshnon kii adhyakshata saat baar unke khate main gayi
 Bengal, along with Maharashtra and Punjab, played a decisive role in the creation of the Congress faction

 However, all these talents faded in front of Rabindranath Tagore's talent

 vidhi yaa kanoon ko vaiyaktik vidhi or pradeshik vidhi - in do pravargon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he
 Personal law refers to a method that is applicable only to a particular individual or class of people, irrespective of where they reside
 yah vidhi pradeshik vidhi se bhinn he jo keval ek nishchit pradesh ke bheetar sab vyaktiyon par samaan rup se lagu hoti he
 That system of personal law was introduced in India by Warren Hastings
 unhone kuch tarah ke divaani maamalon main hinduon ke liye hindu vidhi tathaa musalamaanon ke liye muslim vidhi vihit kii thi
 This system still exists today and Hindu law is applicable to Hindus in matters of marriage, adoption, joint family, debt, partition, right and succession, womanhood, nutrition and religious religions
 east india company dwaara nyaayik adhikaron ke prayog sambandhi pehali vyavastha 1661 main charles dwitiya ke charter dwaara kii gai thi
 The Charter of 1726 established the Mayor’s Courts in all three presidency towns
 in nyaayalayon dwaara jis vidhi ko vyavhaar main laane kaa vichaar tha vah england kii vidhi thi jo deshjon tathaa videshiein donon par samaan rup se lagu hoti thi
 This caused difficulty to the people and the question arose as to whether the behavior method of England should be applied to Indians or not
 1753 ke charter main is baat kii spasht rup se vyavastha kii gai thi ki meyaron ke nyaayalayon ko bharatiyon ke aapasi abhiyogon kii sunwaayee tab tak nahin kerani he jab tak donon paksh apni sahmati se in abhiyogon ko meyaron ke nyaayalayon ke nirnay ke liye prastut na karen
 It has been said by Morley that this is the first reservation of his own laws
 is vyavastha ke siddhant ko warren hestings ne apana liya or 1772 kii yojana main ya vyavastha kii gai ki daay vivaah, jati or anya dharmik prathaon athwa vidhisutron sambandhi sabhi maamalon main, musalamaanon ke liye quran kii vidhi or hinduon ke liye shastron main di gai vidhi kaa sadaa hi avlamban kiya jayega
 The purpose of such a law was to give the people of India an opportunity to be subject to the laws of their ancestors which they were accustomed to and had alliances with
 hestings ko yah vishwaas ho gaya tha ki bahya vaidhik pranali par aadhaarit kisi samhita ko ladane se baari asafalataa kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 The special aspect of this scheme is its limited form
 vaiyaktik vidhi ko keval vishesh vishyon, jaise daay, vivaah, jati or dharmik vidhisutron tak hi simit rakhaa gaya tha
 Apart from this, Hindus and Muslims are divided into different sects and sub-sects
 hindu vibhinn samoohon main, jaise sikh, jain or buddha main bante hue hai
 Shea and Sunni are the two main sects of Muslims
 shia vidhi tathaa sunni vidhi main kaaphi bhinnata he
 As far as the application of his personal law to them was concerned, it was not entirely clear what the status of these different sects would be
 kalantar main aise prashn uthe or unka nipataara keval nyaayalayon dwaara kiya gaya tha
 In the case of King Didar Hussain v
 Queen Juhurunnusa, the Privy Council provided that the Shea people are entitled to receive justice according to their Shea law
 hestings kii 1772 kii vyavastha ko, jisamen hinduon tathaa musalamaanon ke liye vaiyaktik vidhi vihit kii gai thi, keval angrej nyaayadhishon kii sahaayta se kaaryrup dena asambhav ho jaataa kyonki ve bhartiya bhashaaon, bharatiyon ke abhyaason or unki roodhiyon se aparichit the or unhen in vidhiyon kaa koi gyaan nahin tha
 Therefore, Hastings provided these judges with the assistance of Indian law officers, kajis and pundits whose job was to explain the principles of these statutes to those judges
 angrej nyaayadhishon ne un bhartiya vidhi adhikariyon kaa kabhi vishwaas nahin kiya jinke bare main ye samajha jaataa tha ki ve bhrashtachar kar sakate hai or rishwat le sakate hai
 The only option left in this regard was that with the help of experienced and qualified Indian jurists, complete essays of Hindu and Muslim law should be prepared and translated into English
 at: hindu tathaa muslim vidhi ke siddhanton ko sunishchit karne tathaa unki paribhaasha karne ke praytn kiye gaye
 As a result of these efforts, Hellheed's Code on Hindu Law was first prepared
 isi prakaar arabi ke "hidaaya" kaa farsi roopaantar taiyaar kiya
 Similarly, in relation to personal method, many other excellent books composed by famous scholars of English came out
 parantu dand vidhi ke kshetra main koi aarakshan nahin kiye gaye
 In the Muslim Penal Law, which was in force at the time, heavy changes were made and the law remained in force until the Enforcement of Penal Code, 1860 and Penal procedure-code, 1861
 in adhiniumo ne us samay vidyaman dandvidhiyon ko nishprabhavi kar diya or ye adhinium jati, panth or dharm ke bhedbhaav ke bina sabhi par lagu kar die gaye
 Although the laws of Hindus and Muslims were maintained in matters of marriage, adoption, etc
, it was felt that the ancient system of Hindu law was not suited to the changing times
 at: kai aise kanoon banaae gaye jinke dwaara vaiyaktik vidhiyon ko samaaj kii aavashyaktaaon ke anuroop bana diya gaya
 The first important act to amend Hindu law in this regard was the one which provided for the abolition of the practice of "sati"
 striyon kii saamaajik sthiti main sudhaar laane ke liye kai kanoon banaae gaye
 The Hindu Widow Remarriage Act was passed in 1856, which legalized Hindu widow remarriage
 1872 ke vishesh vivaah adhinium ne aise hinduon ko is adhinium ke adheen vivaah karne yogya bana diya jo yah ghoshnaa karen ki ve hindu dharm ko nahin maanate
 In this Act, the Arya Marriage Legalization Act of 1937 provided that all marriages would be valid between such persons who would be Aryasamaji at the time of marriage irrespective of the different castes or different religions before marriage
 in vidhiyon ke dwaara vivaah sambandhi kathor hindu vidhiyon main parivartan kar diya gaya
 In certain circumstances, the Hindu Marriage was given the right to separate residence and nutrition by the Hindu Marriage Separate Residence and Nutrition Rights Act of 1946
 1930 ke hindu vidya abhilabh adhinium main hindu avibhakt parivaar ke ek sadsy ke adhikaron kii us sapatti ke bare main paribhaasha kii gai he jo usne apni vidya ke bal par arjeet kii ho
 Many changes were also made in the area of scope
 hindu daay adhinium dwaara katipay anarh vaarison kaa daay se apvarjan sambandhi hindu purush kii sampada ke liye uttaradhikari ke rup main dur gotreey kii apeksha katipay nikat bandhu ko variyata di jaaegi
 The Hindu Law on Religion, Partition and Right was amended by the Hindu Women's Property Rights Act of 1937 and women were given more rights
 in adhiniyamon ne hindu vidhi kii roodhiwaadee pranali ko anek drushtiyon se prabhavit kiya parantu koi ugr parivartan nahin kiye ja sake
 British administrators were afraid of making changes in personal laws
 unka vichaar tha ki daay, vivaah aadi se sambandhit vidhiyon main hastkshep karne par yah samajha jayega ki deshjon ke dharm main hastkshep kiya ja rahaa he kyonki donon kaa nikat sambandh he or deshjon main isse khij paidaa ho sakati he parantu swatantraprapti ke pashchaat sthiti badal gai
 There were several convincing reasons for the codification of individual statutes
 hindu vidhi par vichaar karne ke liye 1941 main ek samiti niyukt kii gai
 It recommended that the method should be codified in successive stages
 1944 main raav samiti naamak ek anya samiti niyukt kii gai
 This committee submitted its report and presented a draft of the Code
 hindu vidhi vidheyak ko, jo ek lambey arse tak sansad ke samaksh rahaa, kade virodh ke kaaran chhod diya gaya
 Ultimately it was decided that the required legislation be presented in installments
 is prakaar hindu vivaah adhinium 1955 main banaaya gaya tathaa hindu uttaradhikaar adhinium, hindu avyaskta tathaa sangrakshakata adhinium or hindu dattak grahan tathaa poshan adhinium 1956 main paarit kiye gaye
 The Hindu Marriage Act was amended and codified in Hindu law
 iske dwaara vaid hindu vivaah kii sharton tathaa apekshaaon ko bhi saral kar diya gaya he
 By this, bigamy has been made a punishable offense
 daanpaty adhikaron ke pratyaasthaapan, nyaayik pruthakkaran or vivaah tathaa talaak kii naastitvata sambandhi niyam bhi is adhinium dwaara nirdhaarit kiye gaye
 The Hindu Succession Act of 1956 has brought about radical changes in the rules regarding willful succession among Hindus
 is adhinium main daay kii ek samaan pranali kii vyavastha kii gai he or yah mitakshra tathaa daay bhaag dwaara viniyamit vyaktiyon par samaan rup se lagu hoti he
 There are no longer three categories of heirs accepted by Mitakshara, such as Gotraja Sapind, Samododak and Bandhu and three categories of heirs accepted by the dyadhyas such as Sampid, Sakuli and Bandhu
 ab vaarison ko chaar pravargon main vibhakt kiya gaya he jo is prakaar hai Firstly, the property inherits the heirs given in class 1 of the schedule
 or yadi aise koi vaaris na ho to duusare, tisare or chauthe prarg ke vaarison ko milti he
 Now men and women are beginning to be considered equal
 hindu stri dwaara dhrut sampatti uski param sampatti hogi
 The law relating to succession related to women has also been amended by that Act
 hindu dattak grahan tathaa poshan adhinium ke dwaara dattak grahan tathaa poshan kii vidhi ko samhitabaddh kiya gaya he
 According to the previous law, the daughter could not be adopted, but this act provides for the adoption of both boys and girls
 is adhinium dwaara ek hindu stri ko bhi swadhikaar se god lene kaa adhikaar diya gaya he
 Thus we see that the above mentioned laws have drastically changed the orthodox system of Hindu law
 warren hestings kii 1772 kii yojana main daay, vivaah, jati or anya dharmik prathaon sambandhi sabhi maamalon main musalamaanon par quran kii vidhiyon ko lagu karne ke liye vyavastha kii gai thi
 Apart from some changes made by the law, the scheme remains much the same today
 is sambandh main pehla mahatvapurn parivartan 1913 ke vakf adhinium dwaara kiya gaya
 The Sharia Act was passed in 1937
 is adhinium kaa uddeshy yah tha ki sabhi muslim sampradaayon ke liye muslim vidhi ko pun: sthapit kiya jaae

 Traditional fission power is sometimes considered renewable energy, but it is controversial for political reasons as concerns about peak uranium, the disposal of radioactive waste and the risk of accidents, terrorism, or natural disasters are expected
 urja dakshata or navikarniya urja ko akshay urja ke doharith stambh kaha jaataa he
 Some definitions of renewable or sustainable energy are as follows: "urja, jo manushya ke jivan kaal main punah-poorti yogya ho or jo paryaavaran ko koi lambii avadhi kaa nuksaan na panhuchaye
" - jamaica akshay vikaas network By focusing on the potential of the energy source that continues to carry out energy intensive work, renewable energy is separated from other terms used for renewable energy, such as alternative energy and green energy
 jab tak anishchit kaal tak urja strot ke baari maatra main upyog par pratibandh lagaana sambhav na ho, akshay urja kuch maatra main paryaavaran ko pradooshit kar sakati he
 Renewable energy is also different from low carbon energy, which is renewable in the same sense unless it adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere

 Renewable energy technologies inevitably contribute to renewable energy because they typically provide global energy security by reducing dependence on fossil fuels, and the opportunity to reduce greenhouse gases
 antarrashtriya urja agency kahati he ki: First-generation technologies emerged from the industrial revolution at the end of the 19th century and included hydropower, biomass combustion, and geothermal power and heat
 Some of these technologies are still in widespread use
 Second-generation technologies include solar heating and cooling, wind power, modern forms of bioenergy, and solar photovoltaics
 These are now entering markets as a result of research, development and demonstration investments since the 1980s
 The initial investment was prompted by energy security concerns linked to the oil crises of the 1970s but the continuing appeal of these renewables is due, at least in part, to environmental benefits
 Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials
 Third-generation technologies are still under development and include advanced biomass gasification, biorefinery technologies, concentrating solar thermal power, hot dry rock geothermal energy, and ocean energy
 Advances in nanotechnology may also play a major role

 In the United States, the major problem with purchasing green energy through the power grid is that the existing centralized infrastructure that provides electricity to the consumer is not qualified / capable
 is aksham buniyadi suvidha vaale dhaanche ke chalate lagaataar brown out or blike out, ucch CO2 utsarjan, adhik urja laagat, urja gunvattta jaisi samasyaayein upji hai
 In order to expand this new system, increasing demand will be met by investing an additional amount of $ 450 billion in the next 20 years
 Apart from this, this centralized system is now being loaded with the burden of taxes by including renewable energy like wind, solar and geothermal energy
 Renewable resources are often located in remote areas where there is less energy demand due to greater space penetration
 maujuuda buniyadi dhaanche se is urja ko shahari kendron jaise maang vaale kshetron tak sthanantarit karnaa atyaadhik aksham evam kathin kaary hi hoga

 However, several proposals are being made for initiatives to address these distribution problems
 sabase pehle, sanyukt rajya america kaa CO2 utsarjan kam karne ke liye or vaishvik varming kii gati dhimi karne hetu sangrakshan ke madhyam se sabase prabhavi tareeke se prayaas jaruri he
 The current opponents of the American power grid have also advocated decentralization of the grid

 a modern concept for improving our electricity grid is that microwaves are launched directly from satellites in the earth orbit or the moon wherever and wherever they are demanded
 The power generated from solar energy will be achieved on the lunar surface under this system, "the recipient will be a four-tent shaped structure that will work to obtain microwaves and convert them into electricity
" In 2000 NASA said that it is beneficial to work on this technology, but it is not right to say so soon whether it will be cost effective or not

 Those who are not satisfied with the third-party green grid-connected power grid approach can establish their own local-based renewable energy system
 saura se pawan or yahan tak ki kuch prakarnon main sthaneey pen bijli se navikarniya urja vidyut tantra, kai prakaar main se kuch navikarniya urja tantra sthaneey rup se uplabdh he
 Additionally, for those who want to heat or cool their homes with renewable energy, there is a geothermal pump system that uses the static temperature of some of the ground below the ground, which is about 7 -15 ° C
 All this is synonymous with the heat gained by conventional natural gas and petroleum

 In the US, California, Massachusetts, and many other states, a new approach is being adopted in communities for community energy supplies, called community option aggregation, under which municipal funding is relaxed to support this energy, and green funding for development
 Energy is spent on the use of resources
 vyaktiyon ko aamtaur par aashwaasan diya jaataa he ki jis bijli kaa ve upyog kar rahe hai vastav main vah ek harith rang kii urja hi he jo ki unke niyantran ke harith urja strot se nirmit he
 As soon as this system is paid, the owner of renewable / renewable energy can own and manufacture renewable electrical energy, essentially without cost, and sell the surplus product to the local utility center with profit
 akshay / navikarniya urja ke utpaadan ke baad use upyog main laane vaale madhyam main sangrahit kiya jaataa he, yah madhyam swytt upkaran hote he or iske saath hi ise vaahanon par bhi sangrahit kiya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, energy storage is required to provide domestic electricity in remote areas so that it can be used with renewable energy
 In the latter case, the energy generation and consumption mechanisms are usually the executive power systems themselves
 kuch udhaaharan: However, renewable / renewable energy is usually derived from the main electric grid
 iskaa arth yah he ki urja bhandaaran adhiktar upyog main nahin laayaa jaataa kyonki mukhya vidyut grid ko yojit kar us vishisht samay par upbhog kii jane yukt maatra kii hi bijli banaai jaati he
 Energy generation on the main power grid is done in a combination of renewable energy plants as well as other organic fuels such as power plants and nuclear power
 haalanki yah sangyojan he, jo is prakaar kii urja aapurti ke liye aavashyak he, saath hi navikarniya bhi,, sarvottam niraakaran he shakti sanyantron ko charan baddh tareeke se band kiya jaye

 Apart from defeating fossil fuels and nuclear power plants, the other synonym is only to accelerate the distribution and utilization of power from renewable sources
 In this system, re-storage of energy is not necessary
 For example, Trace proposes that it is ready to distribute solar energy from the Sahara to Europe
 europe sahaara or anya deshon ko hawa or sagar se nirmit bijli vitarit kar saktaa he
 In this way, energy can be produced at any time and at any point of the planet because the sun or wind is always present or there is always movement in the ocean's waves and currents
 yah vikalp haalanki alpavadhi main sambhav nahin he, isliye jeevashm eendhan or parmaanu shakti ab bhi urja ke mukhya strot hai mukhya taar bijli net par or ratorat unhen visthapit karnaa sambhav nahin he
 Several large-scale energy storage suggestions regarding grids have been completed
 yah kshamta main sudhaar kar urja ke nuksaan ko kam karata he kintu sthanantaran urja bhandaaran hetu mukhya grid tak ek bahut mahanga samaadhaan he
 Some potential cost can be reduced by using energy storage devices that the consumer buys and not the state
 An example is the car battery used in personal vehicles, which will double as an energy buffer for the power grid
 However, apart from the cost, setting up this type of system would be an extremely complex and difficult process
 In addition, energy storage vessels such as car batteries are also made from materials that are environmentally hazardous
 The combined production of batteries will not be in the interest of the environment even for such a large population
 In addition to car batteries, however, other large-scale energy storage tips have been completed for grids that are less polluting energy carriers

 Estimates for fuel reserves vary widely
 sanlayan janit urja kaa dirghakaalik sthayitv is baat par nirbhar he ki, ek vyaavhaarik or sasti praudyogiki viksit kii ja sakati he yaa nahin
 Proponents like Christine Todd Whitman and Patrick Moore also claim that nuclear power is as environmentally friendly as energy derived from other conventional renewable sources, so it is considered appropriate given the diagnosis of global warming and the growing demand for energy in the world can go
