 Famous by the names Khandoba, Khanderaya, Malhari Martand, etc
, are the deities of the majority of the people of Maharashtra and Karnataka
 unki upasna nimnavargeey samaaj se lekar brahman tak sabhi karte hai
 Khandoba is considered by some to be the avatar of Skanda due to the resemblance of both 'khandoba' and 'skanda' names
 anya log unhen shiv athwa unke bhairav rup kaa avatar bataate hai
 It is said in its evidence that the dog has a place in the Khandoba family and the dog is Bhairava's vehicle
 inke chaar ayudhon main khadg kaa vishesh mahatv he or isi 'khande' ke kaaran inkaa khandoba naam padaa he
 In relation to Khandoba, it is also said that he was originally a historical hero
 unhen kalantar main devtaa maan liya gaya he
 The basis of this imagination is a Kannada text called 'samayya Pariksha'
 khandoba ke sevak ke rup main baadhya or murali kaa ullekh kiya jaataa he
 People say that the name of Khandoba's dog
 murali khandoba kii upasika koi devdasi thi
 In the whole south, there are two classes of worshipers of Khandoba named Baadhya and Murali
 ye log ghoomte phirte hai or bhiksha mangekar khate hai
 In relation to Khandoba, it is also said that the worship of Khandoba came from Karnataka to Maharashtra and Khandoba symbolizes the cultural connection between Maharashtra and Karnataka
 karnataka main khandoba mallari, mallaari martand, mailaar aadi naam se jane jate hai
 His twelve famous places are said to be there
 madras ke upnagar 'mailapur' ke sambandh main kaha jaataa he ki mulat: uskaa naam inhen ke naam par mailarpur tha
 Some Muslims in the south worship him by the name of Mallu Khan

 The story given in relation to them is as follows- krityuga main manichul parvat par dharmaputra saptarshi tap kar rahe the
 There, two demons, Mani and Malla, came and started a disturbance and destroyed the Tapovan of the sage
 tab shokakul rishi indra ke paas gaye
 Indra said that Brahma has given a gift to both the demons to remain immortal
 is kaaran ve unka vadh karne main asamarth hai
 He advised the sage to go to Vishnu
 rishi vishnu ke paas gaye
 When Vishnu also revealed his inability, he came to Shiva
 shiv ne jab rishi kii du:khagaatha suni to ve du:khee hue or unhone mani or mall ke vinaash ke liye martand bhairav kaa rup dhaaran kiya or kartikeya ke netritv main apane saat koti ganon ko lekar manichul parvat par pahunche
 He had a tumultuous war with mani-malla
 ant main martand bhairav ne mani ke vakshasthal ko videern kar diya or vah bhoomi par gir padaa
 Upon falling, he prayed to Shiva to allow him to be near her as a horse
 shiv ne uskaa anurodh sweekaar kar liya
 Similarly, before dying Malla also requested Martand Bhairav that in my name you should be known as Mallari
 tab saptrushi ne bhaymukt hokar martand bhairav se swayambhuling ke rup main prempur main rahane kaa anurodh kiya or unhone unka bhi anurodh maan liya
 Thus the story of Mallari became famous
 mallaari arthath khandoba ko shwet ashv par arudh ankit kiya jaataa he
 The dog lives with them
 unke haath main khadg or trishul hota he

 But now the situation has changed and Dharmamimamsa has to be in the union of science and philosophy

 Where is the source of this type of material? The supreme source of these principles is such a book, which is considered divine knowledge in that sect

 The Pope holds such a position in the Roman Catholic Church
 vivaad ke vishyon par aacharyon kii parishadon ke nishchay bhi pramanik siddhant samajhe jate hai
 The power and nature of God are prominent among the ideas of Dharmamimamsa
 inke atirikt jagat or jeevatma ke swaroop par bhi vichaar hota he
 The main question regarding God is whether he exists as a conscience in the world, or even beyond, above
 jagat ke vishay man poocha jaataa he ki yah ishwar kaa utpaadan he, uskaa udgaar he, yaa nirmaan maatr he
 Productionism, egalitarianism, and constructionism are examined
 jeevatma ke sambandh main, swadhinata or mokshasaadhan chirkaal ke vivaad ke vishay bane rahe hai
 Saint Agastin endorsed earlier determinism and said that no man can be absolved of his deeds, conviction relies on divine compassion

 There is a sage named Parashar
 unke dwaara rachit granthon main 'krushisangrah', 'krishi parashar' evam 'parashar tantra' ke naam ginaae jate hai
 But the basic text of these is 'krishi Parashar'
 is granth ke rachayita parashar muni koun se hai, is vishay par yathesht matbhed he
 Depending on the style of the book, it is not considered written before the 8th century
 'krishi parashar' main krishi par grah nakshatron kaa prabhaav, megh or uski jatiyaan, varshamap, varsha kaa anumaan, vibhinn samayon kii varsha kaa prabhaav, krishi kii dekhbhaal, belon kii suraksha, goparv, gobar kii khaad, hal, jotai, belon ke chunaav, kataai ke samay, ropan, dhaany sangrah aadi vishyon par vichaar prastut kiye gaye hai
 The study of the text shows that Parashar had a rare respect for agriculture
 kisaan kaisaa hona chahie, pashuon ko kaise rakhana chahie, gobar kii khaad kaise taiyaar kerani chahie or kheton main khaad dene se kya laabh hota he, bijon ko kab or kaise surakshit rakhana chahie, ityadi vishyon kaa savistaar varnan is granth main miltaa he
 Regarding the halas, it is given that Isha, Juva, Halasthanu, Niryol, Pashika, Adeshchall, Shahal and Panchni are the eight parts of the plow
 paanch haath kii haris, dhai haath kaa halasthanu, dedh haath kaa for or kaan ke sadrush juva hona chahie
 Juva should be of four hands
 is granth se pataa lagata he ki parashar ke kaal main krishi atyant pusht karm thi
 Krishi Parashar is the most popular book of agriculture in Sanskrit language
 yah maharishi parashar ke dwaara virachit mana jaataa he
 In it, it has been said in the beginning that food is life and force is food
 devtaa, asur, manushya sabhi ann se jivit hai tathaa ann dhaany se utpann hota he or dhaany bina krishi ke nahin hota
 Therefore, all work should be done except agriculture
 krishi ke liye jal kii aavashyaktaa ko dekhte hue tathaa jal ke pramukh saadhan hone ke kaaran vrishti gyaan ko parashar ne pramukhataa di he tathaa isi kram main batalaaya he ki vibhinn grahon kaa varsha par kya prabhaav padataa he jaise ki chandramaa ke sanvatsar kaa raja hone par prithvi dhaany se purna hoti he tathaa shani ke raja hone par varsha mand hoti he
 Similarly, the description of the type of clouds, the description of the symptoms of rainfall in different seasons and the symptoms of drought are also described by Parashar
 saath hi rishi ne krishi karm main niyukt pashuon ke bhi uchit rakrakhaav karne ko kaha he tathaa utana hi krishi karm karneka nirdesh kiya he jisase pashu ko ksht na ho jo pashuon ke prati bhartiya vyavhaar kaa dyotak he
 After this, special attention has also been given to cleanliness of the cowshed
 pashuon ke tyohaaron kaa tathaa hal saamagree kaa bhi varnan rishi ne kiya he
 After this, while describing the time of starting the agricultural work, it is said that in the auspicious time, the plow should be broadcast after worshiping as soon as possible
 iske pashchaat shodhit kiye tathaa sangrakshit hue bijon ko uchit samay main bone kaa nirdesh he saath hi dhaany ko kaatane tathaa usko trinrahit karne kaa varnan he
 Parashar Rishi says that the grain that is not left unadulterated becomes weak
 iske saath hi jalarakshan kaa bhi varnan praapt hota he
 Rishi Parashar, while giving instructions for this, says that water should be conserved on the arrival of autumn and tap water should be planted in the area
 iske saath parashar ne dhaany kaatane se purv pushyayatra kaa vidhaan kiya he jo sabhi vighnon kii shaanti tathaa dhaany kii vruddhi keliye hoti thi
 Thereafter, it has been instructed to cut grain in Poush month

 First in England, in 1811, arrangements were made for the education of Sanskrit language at Oxford University
 iske liye ek kattar isai saamne aayaa
 He was Colonel Joseph Boden, who was a lieutenant-colonel in the East India Company's army in Bombay
 isane avkaash grahan karne ke baad, apni samast sampatti, jo us samay lagbhag pachchisahjaar pound thi, kii vasiyat oxford vishvavidhyalay main sanskrit-professor ke ek pad kii sthapana ke kiye kar di; or vishvavidhyalay ne bhi kritagyata swaroop isna naam 'boden chair of sanskrit rakh diya
 The purpose of the Boden Chair, like the Gurukuls of India, was not merely to teach the Sanskrit language from a literary point of view, but to serve the religious interests of Britain's political and Christian missionaries
 karnal boden ne apni vasiyat, jo ki 15 agast 1811 ko cantarbari, euke ke nyaayalay main registerd kii gai, uske mukhay ansh or uddeshy is prakaar hai: That is, i donate to all my Oxford University

 Thus in 1811, the Sanskrit Chair was established at the University of Oxford, but no person could be found for it at that time

 He came to India as a member of the medical profession, in 1808 and lived here till 1832

 Based on this Sanskrit knowledge, Wilson was made the first Sovereign of the Boden Chair of Sanskrit at Oxford University in 1832
 yahan usne sabase pehle mishnariyon ke liye di religen and philosophical system of di hindooj naamak pustak likhi
 About the purpose of writing this book, he said: arthath yah lekhamala un vyaktiyon kii sahaayta ke liye likhi gai hai jo ki mu dwaara sthapit do saun pound ke puraskaar ke liye pratyaashee hon or jo hindu dharm granthon kaa sarvottam prakaar se khandan kar saken
 In 1860, after Prof
 Wilson's death, the second chairman of the Boden Chair was Mounier Williams
 1819 main bombay main janma maunier ek kattar isai tha
 It was even more committed to destroying Hinduism as he wrote in his book 'A sanskrit-english Dictionary': "in explanation i must draw attention to the fact that i am only the second occupant of the Boden Chair, and that its founder, Col
 Boden, stated most explicitly in his will that the special object of his munificent bequest was to promote the translation of the Scripture in Sanskrit so as to enable his countrymen to procet'd in the conversion of the natives of India to the Christian religion
" "it was on this account that, when my distinguished predecessor and teacher, Professor HH Wilson, was a candidate for the chair in 1832, his lexicographical labors were put forward as his principal claim to election
" "surely it" need not be thought surprising, if following in the footsteps of my venerated master, i have made it the chief aim of my professional life to provide facilities for the translation of the Sacred Scriptures in Sanskrit and for the promotion of a better knowledge of the religions and customs of India, as the best key to a knowledge of the religious needs of our great Eastern Dependency
 My very first public lecture delivered after my election in 1860 was on "the Study of Sanskrit in Relation to Missionary Work in India" 
 That is to say, i would like to draw attention to the fact that i am only the second head of the boden-chair and its founder Colonel Boden has written most clearly in his will that the specific purpose of his will is to translate Sanskrit theology
 So that the people of his country would be able to convert the original inhabitants of India into Christianity

 Certainly, it should not be considered surprising that if following the footsteps of my revered Guruji, i have given the main purpose of my professional life to facilitate the interpretation of the religious texts of Indians in English and the good knowledge of the religions and customs of India

 Walter Cannon and Hans Selaye studied animals to establish an initial scientific basis on the study of stress
 unhone bahari dabaav main pashuon kii shaareerik pratikriyaaon ko mapa jaise garmi or sardi main, lambey samay tak sanyam main or shalyachikitsa kii prakriyaaon main or in adhyayanon se maanav praani ko vagvistaar kiya
 Following the follow-up study of stress in humans, Richard Reh and others believe that the causes of stress differ, can be classified by the magnitude of stress in life and further by the average degree of stress production in life
 Thus, the concept was that stress is traditionally the result of external insults for which the stress experienced is out of control
 haal hi main, jaise bhi ho, yah tark diya gaya ki bahya paristhitiyon se kisi bhi aantarik kshamta main tanaav kaa upaj nahin hota he, balki prabhavit vyakti kis prakaar apane vichaaron, kshamtaaon or samaj se isaki madhyasthata karte hai
 In 1984 Richard Lazarus and Suzanne Fokman suggested that "stress also occurs as a result of imbalance between demand and resources", or "may be caused by pressure greater than one's ability to bear
" " tanaav prabandhan or vikaas ke vichaar par aadhaarit he ki tanaav ek tanavagrast ke liye ek sidhi pratikriya nahin he balki ek sansaadhan he, jisamen tanaav kii pratikriya main sahane kii kshamta, paksh ko badalane kii kshamta or madhyasthata kii anumati se tanaav par niyantran paaya ja saktaa he
 According to the rules, to develop an effective stress management program, it is first necessary to identify the factors centered within the person which intervene and control stress effectively
 According to Lazarus and Fokman's interpretation, tension focuses on the transaction between people and their external environment
 The model conceptualizes stress as how a person evaluates the cause of his stress and overcomes stress through his resources
 model kaa prastaav he ki agar tanaav kaarak - tanaav link tuutata he to ek sambhavit tanaav sakaaratmak yaa chunauti dene ke bajaay ek khatre ke rup main mana jaataa he or agar tanavgrasit ko yah vishwaas he ki tanaav se saamana karne kii ranneetiyon main koi kami nahin he balki paryaapt rup se he, yah jaruri nahin he ki tanaav upasthit sambhavaneey karkon kaa anusaran kare
 model kaa prastaav he ki tanaav ko kam kiya ja saktaa he, tanavgrasit logon kii madad unki tanaav paidaa karne vaale karkon ke prati apni dharna badalane or tanaav se nibatane ke liye, kaushal pradaan karen jisase unke aatmavishvaas main sudhaar ho sake
 The health attainment / natural health model is also based on the idea that stress does not necessarily follow the presence of a potential stress-factor
 vyakti ke moolyankan par dhyaan kendrit karne ke bajaay uski tanaav karkon se muqabla karne kii kushalta par dhyaan dena chahie, swasthya pratiti model ne soch kii prakruti par dhyaan kendrit karte hue kaha ki antat yah ek vyakti ke soch kii prakriya he ki vah sambhavit tanaavpurn bahya paristhitiyon par apni pratikriya byakt karata he
 In this model, the reason for stress is to evaluate oneself at a time when there is a feeling of insecurity and negativity, if in a state with a view of "calm mind", "inner wisdom and common sense," Stress can be felt by evaluating oneself and facing a situation where there is a feeling of insecurity and negativity when the world feels better Go near, maintaining the "calm mind", "inner wisdom" and "common sense"
 is model kaa prastaav he ki tanavagrast vyaktiyon kii madad unke soch kii prakruti ko samaj kar karnaa chaiye - vishesh rup se unhen pahchaan ke liye kshamta pradaan karne kaa jab ve asurakshit soch kii chapet main hon, unhen isse chhudaana he or unhen bal dena ki ve apni prakritik sakaaratmak bhaawanaaon kaa upyog karen - jisase unka tanaav kam ho jayega
 There are many ways to combat stress
 samay prabandhan kii kuch takneeke kisi vyakti ke tanaav ko niyantrit karne main madad kar sakati hai
 When the demand is high in the figure, then some of the demands of others should be "no" to set the limits for learning effective stress management
 The following technique has recently been dubbed the "destressalizer" Journal of the Medical Association of Canada 
 "destraselliser" ek prakriya he jiske dwaara ek vyakti ke tanaav ko dur kiya ja saktaa he
 Stress management techniques will vary according to the theoretical paradigm but may include the following: tanaav ke str ko mapa ja saktaa he
 One way can be used to characterize stressful life events through the use of the Holmes and Reh Strasse scales
 raktchaap or bijli utpann karne vaali twachaa kii pratikriya main parivartan se bhi tanaav pareekshan mapa ja saktaa he or tanaav ke str main badlaav laayaa ja saktaa he
 a digital thermometer can be used to evaluate changes in skin temperature, which can keep the blood from reaching the extremes by indicating the action of a fight or flight response
 tanaav prabandhan se shaareerik or asankramy laabh prabhaav he
 Positive results are reflected using a combination of: non-drug interventions
 karm or uske fal kaa anivaary sambandh he
 The person gets happiness or sorrow in the future according to whatever actions he performs, good and bad
 isi ko karmasiddhant athwa karmwaad kehete hai
 Apart from Charvak, all other Indian philosophies portray karmism in a single voice and consider it highly important for life
 karmwaad kii pratham anubhuti vaidic yajna ke vidhaan main hoti he
 According to Vedic belief, if the Yajna is duly edited, then an invisible power arises from it
 ise adrusht athwa apurv kehete hai
 On this appropriate occasion, the yajna produces the desired fruit
 is prakaar yajna kaa fal manushya ko avashya praapt hota he
 The expression of the relation of this karma and fruit as a universal rule is first found in the principle of the Rit Veda
 rut samast vishwa main vyaapt he tathaa uskaa sanchaalan or niyantran karata he
 This is the basis of the physical and moral system of the world
 devtaa tathaa manushya sabhi iskaa paalan karte hai
 Varun is considered the presiding deity of the Rit
 vah paap karanevaalon ko ghor andhkaar ke gahvar main daalate hai jahaan se unka prayaavartan nahin hota
 Similarly, those who do good deeds get the best happiness
 shatapath brahman ke anusaar mrityu ke uparaant jeev ko do agniyon ke madhya se hokar janaa padataa he
 They burn those who do bad things, but not those who do good
 karm kaa shaashvat tathaa saarvbhaum niyam jagat kii naitik vyavastha kaa aadhaar he
 This is more clearly rendered in the Upanishads
 brihadaaranyak ke anusaar manushya kaa karm hi uske saath jaataa he
 The character and behavior of a soul becomes the same
 chhandogya ke anusaar sundar charitravaale vyakti acchhee yoni praapt karte hai, jaise brahman, kshatriya, vaisya yoni or nindya charitravaale vyakti neech yoniyon main janm lete hai, jaise kute, suar, chandal aadi
 In the Kaushitaki Upanishad, there is a clear mention of Karmaniyam that creatures according to their karma and knowledge take birth in insects, moths, fish, birds, lions, snakes and humans etc
 is prakaar yah spasht ho jaataa he ki jivan main avyavashtha tathaa sanyog ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 The birth of beings, their development, the feeling of their happiness, sorrow etc
, are controlled by karma
 unhen unke karmanusaar fal kii prapti avashya hoti he
 Due to the moral system of life of Karmanium, many problems are also solved from it
 jivan du:khamay he
 It is full of many evils and oddities
 in sabakaa kaaran kya he? bhartiya darshanik nagsen ke anusaar karmon ke antar ke kaaran hi sabhi manushya samaan nahin hote
 Some are older, some are younger, some are healthier, some are patient, some are wealthier and some are poor
 vedant ke anusaar ishwar jeevon ke karmanusaar hi unhen vibhinn fal pradaan karata he
 He has no partiality in it
 isi prakaar anya bhartiya darshan bhi du:kha, asamanta, punarjanm aadi samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karmasiddhant ke dwaara karte hai
 There is a logical difficulty in accepting the essential relation of karma and its fruits
 vah yah he ki karm or uske fal main bahudhaa adhik samay kaa antar dekha jaataa he
 It is also possible that a person has to bear the fruits of deeds done in the present life in his second birth
 is prakaar samay kaa itnaa adhik antar hone ke kaaran karm or fal kaa sambandh kaise sambhav he? bhartiya darshan adrusht, apurv, ashrav tathaa avijipti rup aadi siddhanton ke dwaara is samasya kaa hal prastut karne kaa praytn karte hai
 According to justice, the group of virtue and sin arising from the actions done by the person is called unseen
 yah adrusht aatma ke saath sanyukt rahata he or avasar aane par sukh du:kha aadi falon ko utpann karata he
 According to the Mimansakas, the Yajna etc
 that are performed produce an invisible force in the soul of the Yajnika called Apoorva
 yah apurv aatma main rahata he or kalantar main yajna kaa abhipsit fal utpann karata he
 In Jain philosophy, the relation of karma and fruit is explained by the principle of pudgal karmas in the jiva or the asva of karma pudgal
 isi prakaar buddha darshan ke anusaar praaniyon ke andar ek atyant sookshm or adrishy shakti kaary karti rahati he jise avijipti rup kehete hai
 This produces the result of the auspicious inauspicious deeds done by them
 is prakaar adrusht, apurv, ashrav tathaa avijipti rup tatv karm or fal ke bich sethu kaa kaary karte hai
 Now the question arises whether the principle of karma is opposed to man's freedom of action? Has man been so much bound up with the work done in the previous birth or the earlier work done in this birth that he cannot work independently? Indian philosophy does not accept this view
 unke anusaar manushya karm karne main purna rup se swatantra he
 Earlier deeds can generate special kinds of tendencies in a man, but cannot compel him to do any kind of work
 manushya achche bure jo bhi karm karata he uske liye naitik drushti se vah purna rup se jimmedaar he
 In this way, Karmism or Karmasiddhanta is not even anti-freedom from the determination of man and Kinshastriyatha from his Karmasantantry
 karmaswatantray ke kaaran hi manushya yoga aadi aadhyatmik maaghon kaa anusaran kar karmaniyam kaa ant main atikaraman kar jaataa he or du:kha tathaa janmamaran ke bandhan se sadaa ke liye mukt ho jaataa he

 The joint venture was aimed at the world's best supersonic missiles
 Develop and sell drdo's Dr
 A
 Shivthanu Pillai and npo's Dr
 Herbert Yefremov played an instrumental role in the development of this missile
 The first test of the brahmos missile was carried out on 12 June 2001 from the integrated test site at Chandipur in the Orissa coastal region
 So far several versions of its ramjet technology have been developed
 Based brahmos supersonic missile with 200-300 kg payload can penetrate its targets at a distance of 300 km
 From the ground, the air, the submarines, It can also be launched from anywhere, from the Battle Poto
 The brahmos Cenuvrable version has also been tested so that its route can be changed before it reaches its target after being launched
 There is also a plan to build a sonic missile missile, which will be able to hit its targets at the speed of 7 MAC
 This will have to be done on its own with the aid of Russia, as Russia has signed an international missile technology control treaty, due to which it cannot help other countries in developing a missile with a range of more than 300 km
