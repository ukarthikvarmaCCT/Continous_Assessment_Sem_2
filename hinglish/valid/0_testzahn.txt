 Template: Hindu philosophy Manvantar, according to Hinduism, is the age of the progenitor of humanity
 yah samay maapan kii khagoleey avadhi he
 Manvantara is a Sanskrit word, whose = manu + difference is found on disjuncture
 iskaa arth he manu kii aayu
 Each Manvantara is composed and governed by a particular Manu, who is blessed by Brahma
 manu vishwa kii or sabhi praaniyon kii utpatti karte hai, jo ki unki aayu kii avadhi tak banati or chalati rahati hai, 
 un manu kii matyu ke uparaant brahma fir ek naye manu kii sristi karte hai, jo ki fir se sabhi sristi karte hai
 Along with this, Vishnu also takes the Avatar from time to time, according to its structure and follows it
 inke saath hi ek naye indra or saptarshi bhi niyukt hote hai
 a kalpa is formed by mixing fourteen manu and their manvantara
 yah brahma kaa ek diwas hota he
 It is based on Hindu time cycle and Vedic timeline
 prayek kalp ke ant main pralay aati he, jisamen brahmand kaa sanhaar hota he or vah viraam kii sthiti main aa jaataa he, jis kaal ko brahma kii raatri kehete hai
 After this the creator Brahma starts the creation again, after which the destroyer, Lord Shiva, destroys it
 or yah sab ek antaheen prakriya yaa chakra main hota rahata he
 
 sristi ki kul aayu : 429408 xxrep 4 0 varshaise kul 14 manvantaron me baanta gaya he
 Currently 7th Manvantar i
e
 Vaivaswat Manu is going on
 Before this, 6 manvantaras like Swayambhava, Swarochish, Auttami, Tamas, Raivat, Chakshus have passed, and 7 Savarnas etc
 will be consumed further
 1 manvantar = 71 chaturyugi1 chaturyugi = chaar yug Age of the four Yugas: - Satyuga = 1728000 years Treta Yuga = 1296000 years Dwaparyuga = 864000 years and Kaliyuga = 432000 years Thus total age of 1 Chaturyugi = 1728000 + 1296000 + 864000 + 432000 = 432 xxrep 4 0 years
 1 manvantar = 71 × 432 xxrep 4 0 = 30672 xxrep 4 0 varshachunki ese - ese 6 manvantar biit chuke he 
 isliye 6 manvantar kii kul aayu = 6 × 30672 xxrep 4 0 = 184032 xxrep 4 0 varshavartmaan me 7 wein manvantar ke bhoga me yah 28veen chaturyugi he
 is 28veen chaturyugi me 3 yug arthath satyuga, tretayug, dwapar yug biit chuke he or kaliyug kaa 5115 waan varsh chal rahaa he 
27 chaturyugi kii kul aayu = 27 × 432 xxrep 4 0 = 11664 xxrep 4 0 varsh And total age of 5115 years of Satyuga, Dwapara, Tretayuga and Kali Yuga of 28th Chaturyugi = 1728000 + 1296000 + 864000 + 5115 = 3893115 years
 Thus, the total age of the present age of 28th Chaturyugi till 5115th year = Total age of 27th Chaturyugi + 3893115 = 11664 xxrep 4 0 + 3893115 = 120533115 years Thus total years that have passed = Total age of 6 Manvantara + Total age till 5115th year of Kaliyuga of 28th Chaturyugi of 7th Manvantar = 184032 xxrep 4 0 + 120533115 = 1960853115 years
 So present In 1960853115th year He is walking and has to bear the remaining 2333226885 years which is as follows 


 The remaining age of creation = Total age of creation - 1960853115 = 2333226885 years
 This calculation is based on the role of Rigvedadibhisabha composed by Maharshidayananda

 Tunga River is a river in the state of Karnataka, South India
 is nadi kaa janm gangamoola naam kii jagah par sthit pahaari varahaa parvat ke pashchimi ghaaton par hota he
 From here, this river passes through two districts and the names of these two districts are karnataka-chikmagalur district and Shimoga district
 yah 147 KM lambi he or kudli main bhadraa nadi main jaakar mil jaati he
 After this place, this river is given the joint name Tungabhadra
 tungabhadra purv kii taraf bahati he or andhra pradesh main krishna nadi main mil jaati he
 This river is known for the sweetness of its water and its water is considered the sweetest water in the whole world
 ek viswas he kii "thunga paanaa ganga snaan" jiskaa matlab he kii hame pehle tunga nadi kaa pani pinaa chahie or phir ganga nadi main snaan karnaa chahie
 a dam has been built across this river at Gajanur and a large dam across Tungabhadra at Hospet

 yah mahabharat ke bhishmaparv kaa ang he
 The Gita has 18 chapters and 720 verses
 jaisaa gita ke shankar bhashya main kaha he- tan dharman bhagawata yathopadisht vedavyas: sarvagyobhagavan gitakhyai: saptabhi: shlokashatairu panibandh
 It is known that in the early 20th century, in front of Geeta Press Gorakhpur, there was the same text of Geeta which is available to us today
 20veen sadi ke lagbhag bhishmaparv kaa java kii bhashaa main ek anuwaad hua tha
 Many basics are also safe in it
 shripad krishna belwelkar ke anusaar java ke is pracheen sanskaran main gita ke keval saadhe ikyasi shloke mul sanskrit ke hai
 They also support the current text
 gita kii gananaa prasthaantrayee main kii jaati he, jisamen upanishad or brahmasutra bhi sanmilit hai
 Therefore, according to Indian tradition, the place of Gita is the same as that of Upanishads and Brahmasutras
 gita ke mahatmaya main upanishdon ko gau or gita ko uskaa dugdh kaha gaya he
 This means that the Gita accepts the spirituality of the Upanishads in the Sarvansh
 upanishdon kii anek vidyaayein gita main hai
 For example, Ashwattha lore in relation to the nature of the world, Avyayamusha lore in the context of eternal Ajna Brahma, Aksha Purushu vidha in the matter of Para Prakriti or Jiva, and Ksharapurushu Vidya concerning Apara Prakriti or material world
 is prakaar vedon ke brahmavaad or upanishdon ke aadhyatm, in donon kii vishisht saamagree gita main sannivisht he
 In the words of Pushpika it is called theology
 gita main 'brahmavidya' kaa aashay nivrittiparak gyanmarg se he
 It is called Sankhyamat with which the Nivitvarigi Vibhagya is associated
 lekin gita upanishdon ke mode se aage badhkar us yug kii dein he, jab ek nayaa darshan janm le rahaa tha jo grihasthon ke pravriti dharm ko nivritti maarg ke samakaksh or utana hi faldaayak maanata tha
 The same signifies the word 'yogashastra' in the Pushpika of the Gita
 yahan ‘yogashastre’ kaa abhipraay ni:andeh karmyog se hi he
 Two definitions of yoga are found in the Gita
 ek nivritti maarg kii drushti se jisamen ‘samatvam yoga uchyate’ kaha gaya he arthath gunon ke vaishamy main samyabhav rakhana hi yoga he
 This is the position of Sankhya
 yoga kii duusari paribhaasha he ‘yoga: karmsu kaushalam’ arthath karmon main lage rahane par bhi aise upaay se karm karnaa ki vah bandhan kaa kaaran na ho or karm karanevaala usee asang yaa nirlep sthiti main apane ko rakh sake jo gyanamargiyon ko milti he
 The name of this device is Buddhayog and this is the essence of the Yoga of the Gita
 gita ke duusare adhyay main jo ‘tasya pragnapratishthita’ kii dhun pai jaati he, uskaa abhipraay nirlep karm kii kshamtavali buddhi se hi he
 This was not a situation of attaining renunciation by the renunciation of karma, but a plan to elevate the pre-existing mind to a state of disinterest while performing karma
 yahi gita kaa karmyog he
 Just as in many places in the Mahabharata, so is the interpretation and appreciation of the Sankhya path of Sankhya and the path of Karma
 ek kii ninda or duusare kii prashansa gita kaa abhimath nahin, donon maarg do prakaar kii ru chi rakhanevaale manushyon ke liye hitkar ho sakate hai or hai
 Probably no other book of the world renders the scripture of Karma with this beauty, this subtlety and objectivity
 is drushti se gita adbhut maanviya shaastra he
 Its vision is not one-sided, but all-round
 gita main darshan kaa pratipaadan karte hue bhi jo sahitya kaa anand he vah isaki atirikt visheshta he
 The description of the philosophy through cultured poetry is the personal grief of the Gita, which does not remain without enchanting any heart
 isiilie iskaa naam bhagavadgita padaa, bhagavan kaa gaaya hua gyaan
 The background of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita is the war of Mahabharata
 jis prakaar ek saamaanya manushya apane jivan kii samasyaon main ulajhakar kinkartavyavimudh ho jaataa he or uske pashchaat jivan ke samarangan se palaayan karne kaa man bana letaa he usee prakaar arjuna jo mahabharat kaa mahanayake he apane saamne aane vaali samasyaon se bhaybheet hokar jivan or kshatriya dharm se niraash ho gaya he, arjuna kii tarah hi ham sabhi kabhi-kabhi anishchay kii sthiti main yaa to hataash ho jate hai or yaa phir apni samasyaon se udign hokar kartavya vimukh ho jate hai
 The sages of India, after deep thought, imbibed the knowledge they gave to the Vedas
 inhen vedon kaa antim bhaag upanishad kehalaata he
 The characteristic of human life is the intellectual power acquired by human beings, and the knowledge contained in the Upanishads is not only the highest state of human intelligence but also gives a glimpse of what man can experience beyond the limits of intellect
 gita ke 18 adhyyon main varnit vishyon kii bhi kramprapt sangati he
 The name of the first chapter is Arjunvishad Yoga
 vah gita ke upadesh kaa vilakshan naatakeey rangamanch prastut karata he jisamen shrota or vaktaa donon hi kutuhal shanti ke liye nahin varan jivan kii pragadh samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye pravrutt hote hai
 Shaurya and patience, courage and strength made Arjuna's personality with the impressive amount of these four qualities and above all these four qualities were one and forgiveness, the other is wisdom
 balpradhan kshatradharm se praapt honevaali sthiti main pahunchakar sahasaa arjuna ke chitt par ek duusare hi prakaar ke manobhaav kaa akraman hua, carpanya kaa
 a strange kind of compassion filled his mind and his faint nature vanished
 jis kartavya ke liye vah katibaddh hua tha usase vah vimukh ho gaya
 On looking from above, his arguments in favor of this situation seem to be religious, but he himself has called it Karpanya Dosh and it is believed that due to this cuteness of mind, his natal nature was hurt or destroyed
 vah nirnay nahin kar paa rahaa tha ki yuddh kare athwa vairaygy le le
 What to do, what not to do, was not understood
 is manobhaav kii charam sthiti main pahunchakar usne dhanushbaan ek ore daal diya
 Krishna saw Arjuna's condition that Arjuna's body was fine but before the start of the war, the morale of that wonderful Kshatriya was broken
 bina man ke yah sharir khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Therefore, a guru duty came in front of Krishna
 at: tark se, buddhi se, gyaan se, karm kii charchaa se, vishwa ke swabhaav se, usamen jivan kii sthiti se, donon ke niamak avyay purush ke parichay se or us sarvopari param sattavan brahm ke saakshaat darshan se arjuna ke man kaa uddhaar karnaa, yahi unka lakshya hua
 The subject of this discussion is Gita
 pehle adhyay main saamaanya reeti se bhoomika rup main arjuna ne bhagwaan se apni sthiti kah di
 The second chapter is named Sankhyayoga
 isamen jivan kii do pracheen sanmanit paramparaon kaa tarkon dwaara varnan aayaa he
 Seeing Arjuna weeping in that sorrowful condition, Krishna has brought to his attention that this type of claviness and petty infirmity of heart is not suitable for a hero like Arjun
 krishna ne arjuna kii ab tak di hui sab yuktiyon ko pragnawad kaa jhootha rup kaha
 His trick is that Pragyadarshana essentially accepts all the events and situations of the world from time, karma and nature
 jeena or maranaa, janm lenaa or badhanaa, vishyon kaa aana or janaa
 Experiences of happiness and sorrow, these occur only in the world, this was also called the ancient Acharya synonymism
 kaal kii chakragati in sab sthitiyon ko laati he or le jaati he
 After knowing this nature of life, there is no mourning again
 yahi bhagwaan kaa vyangy he ki pragna ke drushtikon ko maanate hue bhi arjuna is prakaar ke moh main kyon pad gaya he
 An essential part of the above view was the continuity of life and the impermanence of the body
 nity jeev ke liye shok karnaa utana hi vyarth he jitna anitya sharir ko bachaane kii chintaa
 Both of these are unavoidable
 janm or mrityu baari baari se hote hi hai, aisa samajhakar shok karnaa uchit nahin he
 Then another view is of apostasy
 janm se hi prakruti ne sabake liye ek dharm niyat kar diya he
 In it comes the path of life, the periphery of desires, the power of karma
 isse nikal kar nahin bhaaga ja saktaa
 Even if someone runs away, nature again pulls him
 is prakaar kaal kaa parivartan yaa pariman, jeev kii nityata or apana swadharm yaa swabhaav jin yuktiyon se bhagavan, ne arjuna ko samajhaayaa he use unhone sankhya kii buddhi kaha he
 Further, even after Arjuna did not question, he also described the wisdom of the yogamarga
 yah buddhi karm yaa pravriti maarg ke aagrah kii buddhi he isamen karm karte hue karm ke fal kii aasakti se apane ko bachaana aavashyak he
 The biggest fear for the Karmayogi is that he gets trapped in the party of desire for fruit; He should avoid it
 arjuna ko andeh hua ki kya is prakaar kii buddhi praapt karnaa sambhav he
 What would be the situation of a person if he did deeds and no fruit, it was a practical doubt
 usne poocha ki is prakaar kaa drudh pragnawala vyakti jivan kaa vyavhaar kaise karata he? aana, janaa, khaanaa, pinaa, karm karnaa, unamem lipt hokar bhi nirlep kaise rahaa ja saktaa he? krishna ne kitne hi prakaar ke bahya indriyon kii apeksha man ke sanyam kii vyakhya kii he
 Through work, anger, fear, raga, malice, the mild mind is disturbed and the senses are not in control
 indriyajay hi sabase badi aatmajay he
 Even if someone gives up subjects from outside, the inner mind does not agree
 vishyon kaa swaad jab man se jaataa he, tabhi man prafullit, shant or sukhi hota he
 Rivers come in the sea, but he does not give up his dignity
 aise hi sansar main rahete hue, uske vyavhaaron ko sweekaarte hue, anek kaamanaayon kaa pravesh man main hota rahata he
 But those who do not lose their dignity only get peace
 ise pracheen aadhyatm paribhaasha main gita main brahmisthiti kaha he
 Thus, listening to the answer of Sankhya's explanation, in the third chapter called Karmayoga, Arjuna asked a clear question to get deeper into the subject that Sankhya and Yoga do you think well in both these passages and why not say that i am in both of them Whom should i adopt? To this, Krishna replied with the same clearness that there are two loyalties or lifespans in the world - jnana yoga for the Samkhists and karmayoga for the Karmargamis
 yahan koi vyakti karm chhod hi nahin saktaa
 Nature compels a person to perform actions with the effect of all three qualities
 karm se bachnewaalon ke prati ek badi shankaa he, vah yah ki ve upar se to karm chhod baithte hai par man hi man usamen duube rahete hai
 This situation is unbearable and Krishna has called it falsehood in the Gita
 man main karmedriyon ko rokkar karm karnaa hi saral maanviya maarg he
 Krishna even said as a challenge that without karma one cannot get food to eat
 phir krishna ne karm ke vidhaan ko chakra ke rup main upasthit kiya
 Not only are the creations of different persons threaded together on the social plane, but the relationship between man on earth and God of heaven is also dependent on the action cycle
 pratyaksh he ki yahan manushya karm karte hai, krishi karte hai or daivi shaktiyaan vrishti kaa jal bhejti hai
 Both grain and purgenes arise from karma
 ek main maanviya karm, duusare main daivi karm
 Then in favor of Karma, the idea of lok Sangraha has been given, that is, without Karma, the structure of society cannot stand
 jo lok ke netaa hai, janak jaise gyani hai, ve bhi karm main pravriti rakhte hai
 Krishna himself gave his own illustration and said that i am the form of Narayana, there is no work left for me
 phir bhi tandrarahit hokar karm karata hoon or anya log mere maarg par chalate hai
 The difference is that those who are foolish do the work by indulging but the knowledgeable does the work with disrespect
 gita main yaheen ek sabhipraay shabd buddhibhed he
 That is, it is not proper to uproot the people of ordinary understanding who are engaged in karma, because they cannot become knowledgeable, and if their karma is missed, then they will go astray on both sides
 chauthe adhyay main, jiskaa naam gyaan-karm-sanyas-yoga he, yah bataaya gaya he ki gyaan praapt karke karm karte hue bhi karmsanyas kaa fal kis upaay se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In this true Karmayoga is considered to occur in the tradition of the Chakravarti kings
 mandhata, sudarshan aadi anek chakravarti raajaaon ke drushtaant die gaye hai
 This is the famous assurance of the Gita that when there is defamation of religion, then there is an incarnation of God among humans, that is, the power of God is especially tangible
 yaheen par ek vaakya vishesh dhyaan dene yogya he- kshipran hi manushe loke siddhirbhavatee karmaja 
 'karma se siddhi' - There is no more effective sutra in Gitadarshan
 kintu gitatv is sutara main itnaa sudhaar or karata he ki vah karm asang bhav se arthath falasakti se bachakar karnaa chahie
 In the fifth chapter, again she has gone somewhere in the form of tips and perseverance
 isamen karm ke saath jo man kaa sambandh he, uske sanskaar par yaa use vishuddh karne par vishesh dhyaan dilaayaa gaya he
 It has also been said that there is no difference between Sankhya and Yoga by reaching a high level
 kisi ek maarg par thik prakaar se chale to samaan fal praapt hota he
 By surrendering all the deeds of life, a person reaches the pole point of absolute peace and does not indulge in karmic water like a lotus blooming in water
 chatha adhyay aatmasanyam yoga he jiskaa vishay naam se hi prakat he
 The number of subjects is the restraint of the most senses - this is the squeeze of karma and knowledge
 sukh main or dukh main man kii samaan sthiti, ise hi yoga kehete hai
 The noun of the seventh chapter is Jnana Vigyan Yog
 ye pracheen bhartiya darshan kii do paribhaashaayen hai
 Among them, the word science was very important from the Vedic point of view
 sristi ke nanaatv kaa gyaan vigyaan he or nanaatv se ekatv kii ore pragati gyaan he
 Both these views are suitable for humans
 is prasang main vigyaan kii drushti se aparaa or para prakruti ke in do roopon kii jo sunishchit vyakhya yahan gita ne di he, vah avashya dhyaan dene yogya he
 Apara Prakriti has eight elements, Panchabhuta, Mind, Wisdom and Ego
 jis and se maanav kaa janm hota he
 These eight live in it
 kintu yah praakrit sarg he arthath yah jad he
 In this, the consciousness that comes from contact with the efforts of God is called Para Prakriti; He is a living being
 aath tatwon ke saath milakar jivan navaan tatv ho jaataa he
 In this chapter, many forms of God are mentioned, whose further expansion comes in the tenth chapter called Vibhutiog
 yaheen vishesh bhagwati drushti kaa bhi ullekh he jiskaa sutara-vasudev: sarvamiti, sab vasu yaa shariron main ek hi devtatv he, usee kii sangya vishnu he
 But in the people according to their own idi, the same deity is worshiped in many names and forms
 ve sab thik hai
 But it is good that a wise person recognizes the universe which is the highest peak of spiritual science
 aathven adhyay kii sangya akshar brahmyog he
 Akshar Vidya expanded in Upanishads
 gita main us aksharavidya kaa saar kah diya gaya he-akshar brahm paraman, arthath parabrahm kii sangya akshar he
 Spirituality is the name of the combined composition of man, that is, organism and body
 jeevasanyukt bhautik deh kii sangya kshar he or keval shaktitatv kii sangya aadhidaivak he
 The way these three powers work together in the body, the God, and the ghost are called Adhigyas
 gitakar ne do shlokon main in chah paribhaashaon kaa swaroop band diya he
 In the words of Gita, ॐ monosyllable is Brahman
 nawein adhyay ko raajaguhyayog kaha gaya he, arthath yah aadhyatm vidya vidyaraji he or yah guhya gyaan sabamein shreshth he
 The word Raja also had a meaning in mind
 atev man kii divya shaktimayon ko kis prakaar brahmamay banaaya jaay, isaki yukti hi rajvidya he
 In this area, the representation of Brahmanism is predominant, from which the creation of the expressed world is repeated
 veda kaa samast karmkand yajna, amrit, or mrityu, sant or asant, or jitne bhi devi devtaa he, sabakaa paryavsaan brahm main he
 The variety of Devpuja which is popular in the world is also right in its place, this vision of coordination was acceptable to the Bhagwat Acharyas, in fact it was their great power
 isi drushtikon kaa vichaar yaa vyakhya dasven adhyay main pai jaati he
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 iskaa saar yah he ki lok main jitne devtaa hai, sab ek hi bhagwaan, kii vibhutiyaan hai, manushya ke samast gun or avagun bhagwaan kii shakti ke hi rup hai
 Wisdom may be able to explain these liberated gods, but they are there in the world
 koi pipal ko pooj rahaa he
 Some mountain, river or sea, some fish and turtles
 yon kitne devtaa hai, iskaa koi ant nahin
 This abundance of deities is found everywhere in the history of the world
 bhagwaton ne inaki satta ko sweekaarte hue sabko vishnu kaa rup maanakar samanvay kii ek nai drushti pradaan kii
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 jo satv jeev balayukt athwa chamatkarayukt he, vah sab bhagwaan kaa rup he
 Considering this, the mind gets into an uncontrolled state
 11wein adhyay kaa naam vishvaroopadarshan yoga he
 In this, Arjuna saw the world form of God
 viraat rup kaa arth he maanviya dharaatal or paridhi ke upar jo anant vishwa kaa pranavant rachanavidhan he, uskaa saakshaat darshan
 The quadrilateral form of Vishnu is benign on the human plane
 jab arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa viraat rup dekha to uske mastak kaa visphoton hone laga
 'directo na jaane na labhe f shame' These same sentences of panic came out of his mouth and he prayed that the natural condition which God has placed for man is sufficient
 13wein adhyay main ek sidhaa vishay kshetra or kshetrajna kaa vichaar he
 This is the body area, the person who knows it is a field expert
 14wein adhyay kaa naam gunatray vibhaag yoga he
 This subject is a squeeze of all the Vedic, philosophical and mythological metaphysics — there are many interpretations of the three gunas — trios called sattva, raja, tam
 gunon kii samyavastha kaa naam pradhan yaa prakruti he
 a pathless creation is born from the contrast of qualities
 akelaa satv shant swabhaav se nirmal prakaash kii tarah sthir rahata he or akelaa tam bhi jadvat nishcesht rahata he
 But Rajoguna, who is in the middle of the two, drags them to the ground of Chesta
 gati tatv kaa naam hi rajas he
 The name of the 15th chapter is Purushottamayoga
 isamen vishwa kaa ashwatth ke rup main varnan kiya gaya he
 This ashwattha-like world is a great expansion
 desh or kaal main iskaa koi ant nahin he
 But the root or center of it, which is called the upward, is Brahm
 On the one hand, the ultimate glory, which gives rise to the cosmopolitan Ashwattha, is manifested in the form of the Sun and the Moon, on the other hand, it is in a Chaitanya center or Zoological
 Is in the body
 jaisaa gita main spasht kaha he-ahan vaishwanaro bhutva praninaan dehamashrith: 
 There is no more mystery than globalism or pranamayi consciousness
 nar yaa purush teen hai-kshar, akshar or avyay
 The name of the Panchabhutas is Kshar, the name of Prana is Akshar and the noun of Manastattva or Consciousness is indestructible
 inhen teen naron kii ekatra sthiti se maanvi chetana kaa janm hota he use hi rishiyon ne vaishwanar agni kaha he
 In the 16th chapter, the department of Dewasur property is described
 aarambh se hi rigdev main sristi kii kalpana daivi or asuri shaktiyon ke rup main kii gai he
 It is a fantasy of two forms of creation, one good and the other bad
 ek prakaash main, doosraa andhkaar main
 One nectar, the other mortal
 ek satya, doosraa anrut
 The noun of the 17th chapter is Shraddhatraya Vigyan Yoga
 iskaa sambandh sat, raj or tam, in teen gunon se hi he, arthath jisamen jis gun kaa pradurbhaav hota he, uski shraddha yaa jivan kii nishtha waisi hi ban jaati he
 Yagya, penance, charity, deeds are all conducted with three types of devotion
 yahan tak ki aahaar bhi teen prakaar kaa he
 The Gita has explained their differences and characteristics here
 18wein adhyay kii sangya mokshasanyas yoga he
 It contains a summary and epilogue of all the teachings of the Gita
 yahan pun: balpurvak maanav jivan ke liye teen gunon kaa mahatv kaha gaya he
 There is no one among the human beings of the earth and among the gods of heaven who is saved from these three qualities of nature
 manushya ko bahut dekh bhalkar chalanaa aavashyak he jisase vah apni buddhi or vritti ko buraai se bachaa sake or kya kaary he, kya acarya he, isko pahchaan sake
 The intellect which properly recognizes religion and unrighteousness, bondage and salvation, instinct and retirement, is the true wisdom and is the true achievement of man
 is prakaar bhagwaan ne jivan ke liye vyaavhaarik maarg kaa upadesh dekar ant main yah kaha he ki manushya ko chahie ki sansar ke sab vyavhaaron kaa sachai se paalan karte hue, jo akhand chaitanya tatv he, jise ishwar kehete hai, jo prayek praani ke hriddesh yaa centre main virajman he, usamen vishwaas rakhe, uskaa anubhav kare
 He is the entity's power, he is consciousness and he is the source of supreme bliss
 sanskrit sahitya kii parampara main un granthon ko bhashya, kehete hai jo duusare granthon ke arth kii vrihad vyakhya yaa tikaa prastut karte hai
 The Bhagavad Gita is also one of the three texts that had to clarify their perspective in order to establish any new philosophy or any new form of philosophy in the Indian philosophical tradition
 gita par anek achaaryon evam vidwaanon ne tikaayen kii hai
 Their short list according to sects is as follows: inke atirikt maharashtra sant gyandev yaa gyaneshwarkrut bhavarthadipika naam kii tikaa prasiddh he jo gita ke gyaan ko bhavatmak kavyastylee main prakat karti he
 In the present era, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilakkrit Geetarasya Tika, which was first introduced in 1915 with very detailed role and deliberation
 main puna se prakashit hui thi, gita sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhti he
 He has made such a diversion in bringing the original meaning of Gita to scholars, which was not possible till today after Shankaracharya
 vastut: shankaracharya kaa bhashya gita kaa mukhya arth gyanaprak karata he jabaki tilak ne gita ko karm kaa pratipadak shastr siddh kiya he
 Among all the languages available on the Bhagavad Gita, the element of Shri Jayadayal Goindka is the most popular and popular
 iskaa prakaashan gitapress ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Aaj Tak has sold 100 million copies
 shrimadbhagavadgita badalte saamaajik paridrishyon main apni mahatta ko banaae hue hai or isi kaaran takneekee vikaas ne isaki uplabdhta ko badhaayaa he, tathaa adhik bodhgamy banane kaa prayaas kiya he
 In the serial Mahabharata, aired on Doordarshan, Bhagavad Gita was a special attraction, while in the serial Sri Krishna, the Bhagwad Gita was highly researched and shown as a series of episodes
 isaki ek vishesh baat yah rahi ki gita se sambandhit saamaanya manushya ke sandehon ko arjuna ke prashnon ke madhyam se uttarit karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Apart from this, the serial gita-rahasya by Nitish Bhardwaj was completely focused on different dimensions of Gita itself
 internet par bhi aaj anekanek websiten is vishay par bahumadhyamon ke dwaara vishad jaankaree detii hai
 Shrimad Bhagwadgita is currently attracting attention of people not only in India but also abroad with her philosophical approach towards life more than religion
 nishkaam karm kaa gita kaa sandesh prabandhan guruon ko bhi lubhaa rahaa he
 It is included in the most famous books of all religions of the world

 At the time of British rule in India, that part of the Indian product which was not available for public consumption and due to political reasons, which was flowing towards England, in return for which India did not get anything, would get economic drain or money
 -nikkasana was given the name
 dhan kii nikasi kii avadharana vaanijyavaadee soch ke kram main viksit hui
 Many economic historians of the time expressed their views on the principle of money-expulsion
 inamen dada bhai nauroji ne apni pustak “pavarty and anbritish rule in india” main sarvapratham aarthik nikaas kii avadharana prastut kii
 He called the expulsion of money the evil of all evils
 1905 main unhone kaha tha, dhan kaa bahirgaman samast buraaiyon kii jad he or bhartiya nirdhantaa kaa mul kaaran
 Nationalist thinkers like Ramesh Chandra Dutt, Mahadev Govind Ranade and Gopal Krishna Gokhale have also highlighted this process of expulsion of wealth
 inke anusaar sarkaar sinchai yojanaon par kharch karne ke sthaan par ek aise mad main vyay karti he jo pratyaksh rup se samrajyavaadee sarkaar ke hiton se judaa hua he
 The main elements of the economic exit were the salary and allowances of British administrative and military officers, interest on loans taken from abroad by India, goods purchased from UK stores for civil and military departments, payments made to shipping companies and foreign banks
 And insurance dividends
 bhartiya dhan ke nikalakar england jane se bharat main puunji kaa nirmaan evam sangrahan nahin ho sakaa, jabaki isi dhan se england main audyogic vikaas ke saadhan tathaa gati bahut bad gayi
 The dividends that the British economy received from this money were then repatriated to India as capital and thus the exploitation of India continued to grow
 is dhan ke nikaas se bharat main rojgaar tathaa aay kii sambhaavnaaon par atyadhik pratikul prabhaav padaa
 This immense expulsion of wealth was making India weak within itself
 vaanijyavaadee vyavastha ke atanrgat dhan kii nikasi us sthiti ko kaha jaataa he jab pratikul vyapaar santulan ke kaaran kisi desh se sone, chaandi jaisi keemtee dhaatuen desh se baahar chali jaaen
 It is believed that up to 50 years before the Battle of Plassey, the British East India Company brought a precious metal of two crore rupees to India for the purchase of Indian goods
 british sarkaar dwaara company ke is kadam kii aalochana kii gayi thi kintu karnataka yudhon evam plasi tathaa baxur ke yudhon ke pashchaat sthiti main naatakeey pavirthan aayaa
 With the acquisition of the Bengal Diwani British Company, the company resolved its investment problem
 ab aantarik vyapaar se praapt rakam, bengal kii lut se praapt rakam tathaa bengal kii divaani se praapt rakam ke yoga ke ek bhaag kaa nivesh bhartiya vastuon kii kharid ke liye hone laga
 Thus India did not get any economic, material or financial benefit in exchange for what India exported to Britain
 kintu bengal kii divaani se praapt rajasav kaa ek bhaag vastuon ke rup main bharat se britain hastantarit hota rahaa
 This can be called transfer of funds from India in favor of Britain
 yah prakriya 1813 tak chalati rahi, kintu 1813 i0 charter ke tahat company kaa rajasav khaataa tathaa company kaa vyapaarik khaataa alag-alag ho gaya
 Under the charter of 1813, the way of India was opened to British goods and the company's trade monopoly in India was abolished
 ise ek mahatvapurn parivartan ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 The situation was even more worrying when the finished goods exported from India were discouraged by the company in Britain and Europe
 parinaam yah niklaa ki ab company ke samaksh apane share dharakon ko dene ke liye rakam kii samasya utpann ho gai
 Initially, the company attempted to solve this problem by exporting indigo and cotton, but Indian indigo and cotton could not stand up to low-cost finished American products due to products from the Caribbean countries and cheap labor
 atah niryaat agesiyon ko ghaataa uthaanaa pada
 That is why the company emphasized the production of opium in India as an alternative
 phir badi maatra main opium china ko niryaat kii jane lagi
 The export of opium was as deadly for the health of the Chinese people as it was for the occupational health of the company
 opium vyapaar kaa virodh kiye jane par bhi british company ne china par jabaran yah ghaatak jehar thope diya
 The UK would export opium from India to China and instead grow silk and tea and earn profits
 is prakaar, bharat se niryaat to jari rahaa kintu badale main us anupaat main aayaat nahin ho paaya
 This problem persisted even after 1858 AD with its changed form
 1858 i main bharat kaa prashasan british ne apane haathon main le liya
 Under the provisions of this change, the post of Secretary of India was created for the administration of India
 bharat sachiv tathaa uski parishad kaa kharch bhartiya khate main daal diya gaya
 The amount spent in suppressing the rebellion of 1857 AD was also added to the Indian account
 isse bhi adhik dhyaan dene yogya baat yah he ki bhartiya sarkaar ek nishchit rakam prativarsh grih-vyay ke rup main britain bhejti thi
 This amount of expenditure included many items, such as - guaranteed interest on railways, interest on government loans, purchase of military goods made in Britain for India, pension amount of retired British officers from India, etc
 is prakaar grih-vyay kii raashi kii gananaa dhan kii nikasi ke rup main kii jaati thi
 It is noteworthy that in the 19th century, the expenditure of money was not only included in household expenditure, but some other items were also added to it
 udhaaharan ke liye-bharat main karyrat british adhikariyon ke vetan kaa vah bhaag jo vah bharat se bachaakar britain bheja jaataa tha tathaa nijee british vyapaariyon kaa vah munafa jo bharat se britain bheja jaataa tha
 Then, in the 1870s, when the rupee was depreciated in comparison to the British Pond Staling, the actual amount of money withdrawn increased even more than before
 dadabhai nauroji ne 6 kaaran bataae hai jo dhan-nishkasana ke siddhant ke kaaran bane- Nationalist thinkers, while proposing the principle of expulsion of wealth, recognized the contradiction between imperialism and nationalism and thus the concept of economic nationalism was born
 iske dwaara british sarkaar ke saare daavon ko khaarij karne main madad mili, jaise- upyogetavaad, aadhunikaran ke pratik, swarajya, shiksha aadi
 This consciousness of economic nationalism began to emerge in the Swadeshi movement in 1906 when the slogan of boycott of foreign goods and spread of indigenous goods was raised
 dhan ke nishkasana se resham udyog, vyapaar, krishi aadi main nivesh nahin hua
 As a result, the per capita income of the people started decreasing
 akaal kii nirantarata ne inke jivan ko or bhayaavah bana diya
 Thus, relative to other states of Europe, both the standard of living and life expectancy of the people of India decreased and these exploited people later emerged as social bases of Indian nationalism

 In his famous book, he tried to look at the principle of expulsion of wealth from a new angle
 unhone british sarkaar dwaara bhartiya dhan ke lut ke teen charnon main vibhajit karte hue adhyayan kaa prayaas kiya he
 The main objective of the British Government at this stage was to establish a monopoly on Indian trade, to earn maximum profits, to stop the money brought from Britain for Indian trade, and from the Indian money which was robbed of misuse and income or money derived from business monopoly Indian commodities had to be bought and exported
 britain main audyogic kranti ke baad ek naveen raajnneetik evam aarthik paridrishy ubharkar aayaa
 In this scenario, a strong middle class began to emerge in Britain which was born out of the Industrial Revolution

 It was in this context that the Act of 1813 was passed by which the trading monopoly of the East India Company over Indian trade was abolished and Indian trade and commerce were opened to the whole of the British citizens

 The main demand of the economic policy of the British Government during this period was: -
