 Its main purpose is to study the microorganism world
 isamen prakaash ke paravartan, apvartan, vivartan or vidyutchumbakeey vikiran kaa prayog hota he
 This branch of science is mainly used in biology
 vishwa bhar main rogon ke niyantran or nai aushadhiyon kii khoj ke liye microscopy kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 The three popular branches of microscopy include optical, electron and scanning probe microscopy
 microscopy vishay kaa aarambh 17veen shatabdi ke aarambh main hua mana jaataa he
 At the same time when scientists and engineers discovered lenses in physics
 lens ke avishkaar ke baad vastuon ko unke mul aakaar se bada kar dekhnaa sambhav ho paaya
 This made the philosophy of activities of small and other microscopic animals found in water accessible and the scientists got to know new facts about them
 iske baad hi vaigyanikon ko yah bhi gyaat hua ki praani jagat ke bare main apaar sansar unki pratiksha main he va unka gyaan ab tak kitna kam tha
 Visual microscopy is considered to be the earliest birth as a branch of microscopy
 ise prakaash sookshmdarshan bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is used to see the organs of animals
 prakaash sookshmdarshi apekshaakrit mahange kintu behatar upkaran hote hai
 The discovery of electron microscopes in the field of microscopy is considered an extremely important milestone because after its discovery it was possible to see objects several thousand times larger than their actual size
 isaki khoj beesvin shatabdi main hui thi
 Although the electron microscope is costlier than other microscopes and it is not possible for students to use it in the laboratory, the results are much better
 isse praapt chitra ekadam spasht hote hai
 Another technique is used in microscopy, which is considered better than electron microscopy
 isamen haath or salaai ke prayog se vastu kaa kai konon se pareekshan hota he
 Graham Stein first noticed the bacteria in this process
 sookshmdarshiki bhautikee kaa ek abhinn ang he
 Today microscopes are widely used in medicine, biology, phylology, metrology, crystallology and the study of metals and plastics
 aaj sookshmdarshi kaa upyog vastuon ko dekhne ke liye hi nahin hota varan dravyon ke kanon ke maapne, gananaa karne or taulne ke liye bhi iskaa upyog ho rahaa he
 The tendency of man is always to know and see more and more, that is why he wants to solve the mysteries of nature more and more
 hamaari indriyon kii kaary karne kii kshamta simit he or sahi yahi haal hamaari aankh kaa bhi he
 It also has its own limits
 bahut dur kii jo vastu khaali aankh se dikhaai nahin padati vah doordarshee se dekha ja sakati he yaa bahut nikat kii vastu kaa vistrut vivaran sookshmdarshi se adhik spasht dekha ja saktaa he
 Here the progress made in the field of microscopes since 1865 AD is being mentioned here: ekal uttal lens, jise saadhaarant: aavardhan lens kehete hai, saralatam sookshmdarshi kaha ja saktaa he
 It is also called 'JB microscope'
 saral sookshmdarshi ek nishchit duuri par sthit do uttal lenson ke sangyojan se bana hota he
 The lens facing towards the hemisphere is called the visible lens and the lens near the eye is the 'actress lens'
 aise sookshmdarshi kaa drushtikshetra simit hota he
 This needs improvement
 abhinytra lens main ek lens jodne se kshetra bad jaataa he or goleey varnavipathan evam varniya varnavipathan se utpann dosha kam ho jate hai
 Such microscopes are called combined microscopes or light microscopes or conventional optical microscopes
 yadhyapi prakaash ke paravartan, apvartan or rekhiy sancharan ke niyam greek darshanikon ko isa se kuch shatabdiyon purv se hi gyaat the par aapatan kone or apvartan kone ke jya ke niyam kaa avishkaar satrahavin shatabdi ke uttarardh tak nahin hua tha

 The condition of microscopes remained the same until Abe's time
 1870 i
 main aibe ne sookshmdarshi kii sadrudh neenv daali
 He brought out the famous oil immersion technology
 isse sarvotkrisht vaishamy or aavardhan praapt hua
 But as far as the study of parasites was concerned, scientists were still feeling helpless
 1873 i
 main aibe ne anubhav kiya ki sookshmdarshi ko chaahe kitni hi purnataa pradaan karne kaa praytn kiya jaae kisi padaarth main uske kanon kii sookshmata ko ek seemaa tak hi dekha ja saktaa he
 It is impossible to see an atom or molecule only with our eyes because there is a limitation of our eyes seeing microscopic objects
 yah seemaa upkaran kii apurnataa ke kaaran hi nahin parantu prakaash tarangon kii prakruti ke kaaran bhi he jinke prati hamaari aankh samvedansheel he
 If we want to see metals, our biologists have to develop a new type of eye that will receive waves that are thousands of times smaller than the waves that our current normal eyes, or astrology, can perceive
 vastav main kisi vastu main sthit do nikatavarti binduon ko kabhi bhi alag pahachaanaa nahin ja saktaa he yadi us prakaash kaa tarang dairghy jisamen un binduon kaa avlokan kiya jaataa he un binduon ke bich kii duuri ke dugane se adhik na ho
 In this way it limits their disillusionment
 ise vibhedan kii seemaa kehete hai
 In mathematics it is expressed by the following relation
 vibhedan yaa pruthakkaran kii seemaa Where NA is the numerical bisector and NA = sin
 yahan u vastu duuri kaa apvartanaank he
 q is the angle that the rim ray makes along the optical axis
 is prakaar drushti vikiran kaa vichaar karne se alpatam vibhedan duuri 3000 A° ke lagbhag hoti he
 For the smallest ultraviolet and infrared rays, this limit will be around 1500 a ° and 3850 a °, respectively, where 1 a ° = 10-8 cm
 aaie ham apane ko purv ke sookshmdarshikivid ke rup main sochen or un sudhaaron par vichaar karen jo ham us samay karnaa chaahate the
 Generally, we focus our hopes on four things: uparyukt sudhaar yaa kathinaaiyon kaa vastu kii prakruti, pradipti ke prakaar or photography takneekee ne san 1895 main eks kiran kaa avishkaar kiya
 But until 1912, there was no idea of the wave nature of the x ray until Van Lauey proved it
 ab yah aashaa hui ki eks-re sookshmdarshi banaaya ja saktaa he
 So this idea was abandoned at that time

 The wavelength of this radiation is expressed by the following relation
 yahan h plank kaa niyatank he, m electron kaa dravyaman or q veg hai
 Velocity is the function of voltage, which is used to accelerate the electron beam

 Today, electron microscopy has many techniques of its own
 ucch urja electron kii bhanti laghutarangdairghy ke saath-saath eks kirnon main vedhankshmata bahut adhik hoti he or ve kam shighrata se avashoshit bhi hoti hai
 Thus, x rays can be used to determine the internal structure of small opaque objects

 This means that less radiation enters and hence exposures are much larger
 peeche chitra kaa bada vistaar karnaa padataa he jiske liye bahut sookshm kanon kaa paayas aavashyak hota he
 Now let us look at general visible light microscopy
 iske purv ki ham us disha main hua pragati par vichaar-vimarsh kare, hamen un aakankshaon par dhyaan rakhana hoga jo 40 varsh purv sookshmdarshikividon kii thi
 It was not possible to fulfill all the requirements with a single device
 vibhedan kshamta main vruddhi sankhyatmak dwarak ke maan se simit ho jaati he jiskaa maan 1
5 se adhik nahin ho saktaa
 There is also a limit to the increase of the magnification capacity of the system
 yah prayukt leson kii focus duriyon kaa falan he
 Magnification is the inverse function of the focus distance, so the lack of focus distance leads to magnification
 par saath hi kriyaatmak duuri nasht ho jaati he
 Because of such ideas, Birch built reflective microscopes in 1947 in Bristol using mirrors in place of lenses
 siddhantat: parabangnee kiran tak vikiran kaa upyog yahan sambhav ho sakaa
 It has a lower numeric gateway but has the advantage of greater achromaticity and greater functional distance
 chunki quartz 2000 A° tak vikiran kaa avasorana nahin karata isliye us sookshmdarshi se jisamen kwatarj lenson kaa upyog hota he, kam se kam vibhedan duuri 1,000 A° praapt hogi at: is prakaar ke vinyas ke saath parabangnee vikiran ke upyog se 'parabangnee sookshmdarshi' kaa nirmaan hota he
 If an ordinary light microscope is used to collect radiation scattered by small objects, this type of arrangement is called a microscope
 pro jernik ne sookshmdarshi main kala vaishamy pradipti kaa upyog kiya
 This technology was called art contrast microscope
 yah rangahin visheshat: paardarshak padaarthon kii sanrachana dikhaane kii vidhi he
 Differentiation is seen in them due to different structures, such as in the frog's liver
 vaishamy ko sudhaarney ke liye jaivikivid ranjakon kii sahaayta lete hai
 This is usually done with contrasting color filters
 dhruvit prakaash se kuch hi kism ke crystalon kaa vishleshan kiya ja saktaa he par kalavaishamy se sab prakaar ke crystalon kaa adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he
 This technique does not use artificial colors as a stain
 abhiranjan main dosha yah bataaya jaataa he ki yadhyapi abhiranjan jeevon kaa koshikaon ko nasht nahin karata he, tathaapi aisa nahin kaha ja saktaa ki vah jeevon yaa koshikaon ko bilkul prabhavit nahin karata
 The advantage of art-contrast method is that illumination, which is required in every microscope, does not require anything else to see the organism
 kala vaishamy sookshmdarshi main sookshmdarshi saamaanya kism kaa hi rahata he
 There is only this novelty that a new light device is added
 pa ek kaanch kaa plate he jisamen ek valayakaar khaanchaa he
 The plate is coated with a transparent coating of calcium fluoride
 lep kii motaai ek si rahati he
 In vacuum, evaporation is plastered
 lep kii motaai thik itani rahati he ki khaanchaa or plate ke anya bhaag dwaara paarit prakaash ke bich ke samay kaa antar kampan kaa chaturthaansh rahe
 There is a curtain in which there is a annular cut which passes through as much light in the landscape as it would fill in the grooves of the Kalapatta
 vastu dwaara bikharit or vivartit prakaash khaanche dwaara paarit nahin hota or yah prakaash jab pratibimb par pahunchataa he, tab vah strot se sidhe pahunche prakaash se mila hua nahin hota he or vyatikaran chitra banataa he
 This is reflected in the actress
 vastu ke vibhinn ang apvartanaank ke anusaar prakaash main vibhinn kalantar pradarshit karte hai at: abhinytra main dikhaai padane vaala pratibimb vastu kaa apvartanaank chitra hota he
 This microscope became available for use by 1952 AD
 1952 i
 main is uplabdhi ke liye pro jernik ko nobel puraskaar mila
 Dyson solved this problem differently in 1951, which led to the creation of interfacing microscopes that had some superiority over conventional articular microscopes
 isamen vastu kii kaanch ke do ardhrajtit patton ke madhya main dabaa diya jaataa he or use ek vishesh darpan pranali se is prakaar dekha jaataa he ki kuch prakaash abhinaytrak main bina vastu se paarit hue sidhaa chalaa jaae or shesh prakaash vastu se hokar jaae
 The expressed expression thus expresses the refractive index structure of the finge object
 vastut: do prakaar kii yah pradipti dhundli prishthbhumi or kalavaishamy maanav ke liye ek bada mahatv kaa saadhan he
 The blurred background illumination has proven useful in observing extremely fine particles, and art contrast illumination has increased the technical possibility of knowing the minimum change in optical density so that reflection can be easily explained
 ham dekhte hai ki chalis varsh purv ke sookshmdarshividon kii anek aakankshaayen puri ho gai hai
 This is not the end here because there is no end of research and the same is for microscopy and efforts are still being made to increase the above limit of differentiation capacity of magnification capacity
 nae kism ke kaanch or plastic ke upyog se sookshmdarshiki kii takneekee main or bhi pragati hona anivaary he
 From all these microscopes, which have been described, only in detail can be obtained
 sookshmdarshiki kii or shakha he jo badi shandaar or rochak he
 This is the light resolution microscope

 Gayatri Mahamantra is an important mantra of the Vedas, whose importance is considered to be almost equal to 6
 yah yajurveda ke mantra ' bhurbhuvah swah' or rugveda ke chand 3
62
10 ke mail se bana he
 Savitri Dev is worshiped in this mantra, hence it is also called Savitri
 aisa mana jaataa he ki is mantra ke uccharan or ise samajhane se ishwar kii prapti hoti he
 It is also worshiped in the feminine form of Shri Gayatri Devi
 'gayatri' ek chand bhi he jo rugveda ke saat prasiddh chhandon main ek he
 The names of these seven verses are - Gayatri, Ushnik, Anushtupa, Brihati, Virat, Tritupa and Jagati
 gayatri chand main aath-aath aksharon ke teen charan hote hai
 Among the mantras of the Rigveda, Gayatri verses have the highest number except the trinity
 gayatri ke teen pad hote hai 
 Therefore, when the symbol of creation was conceived in the form of verses or speech, then this world was considered the form of Tripada Gayatri
 jab gayatri ke rup main jivan kii pratikatmak vyakhya hone lagi tab gayatri chand kii badhati hui mahita ke anuroop vishesh mantra kii rachana hui, jo is prakaar he: We should imbibe the divine in our soul, sorrowful, joyous, exquisite, glorious, sinful, godlike
 vah paramatma hamaari buddhi ko sanhmaarg main prerit kare
 This mantra is first quoted in the Rigveda
 iske rishi vishwamitra hai or devtaa savita hai
 Though this mantra is only one of the 18 mantras of this sukta of Vishwamitra, but the Rishis had experienced its glory from the beginning in the sense of meaning and among the 10 Sahasra mantras of the entire Rigveda, the most serious euphemism of the meaning of this mantra
 done
 is mantra main 24 akshar hai
 There are three stages of eight letters each
 kintu brahman granthon main or kalantar ke samast sahitya main in aksharon se pehle teen vyahritiyaan or unase purv pranav yaa onkaar ko jodakar mantra kaa puraa swaroop is prakaar sthir hua: This form of the mantra is called Manu by Sapranava, Savyahritika Gayatri and has done the same in chanting
 gayatri tatv kya he or kyon is mantra kii itani mahima he, is prashn kaa samaadhaan aavashyak he
 According to Aarash belief, Gayatri gives a complete explanation of the interrelationship of Virat Vishva on the one hand and human life on the other, Devatattva on the one hand and Ghosts on the other, Mind on the one hand and Prana on the other, Knowledge on one hand and Karma on the other
 is mantra ke devtaa savita hai, savita surya kii sangya he, surya ke naanaa rup hai, unamem savita vah rup he jo samast devon ko prerit karata he
 The awakened mind in the awakening is the great power of man
 jaise savita dev he vaise man bhi dev he 
 Mind is the motivator of life
 man or praan ke is sambandh kii vyakhya gayatri mantra ko isht he
 Savita Mana presides over all actions in the form of life, this truth is evident
 ise hi gayatri ke tisare charan main kaha gaya he
 The interpretation of Brahmanical texts is - Karmāni dhiya:, that is, what we call dhi or intelligence element is not only the thoughts or imagination of the mind, but those thoughts have to be tangible in form
 yahi uski charitarthta he
 But for this powerful power of mind, it is necessary to have strong or strong mind
 us man kaa jo tej karm kii preran ke liye aavashyak he vahi varenya bharg he
 There is no cross of the powers of the mind
 unamem se jitna ansh manushya apane liye sakasham bana paata he, vahiin uske liye us tej kaa varaniya ansh he
 Therefore, the special sound in the prayer of Savita's life is also that Savita or the divine part of the mind is incarnated on the surface of the earth or ghosts and illuminates in the body
 is gayatri mantra main anya kisi prakaar kii kaamana nahin pai jaati
 The only desire here is that the divine power that man has received from God in the form of mind, he should know the same savita and through deeds make him meaningful in this life
 gayatri ke purv main jo teen vyahritiyaan hai, ve bhi sahetuk hai
 Earth is indicative of Prithvi loka, Rigveda, Agni, earthly world and waking state

 dardi yaa dardik bhashaayen hind-arya bhashaaon kii ek upashakha he jisaki sabase jaani-maani bhashaa kashmiri he
 Dardi languages are spoken in northern Pakistan, north-eastern Afghanistan and the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir
 sari dardi bhashaaon main kashmiri kaa hi rutaba sabase unchaa he kyonki iskaa apana prachlit sahitya he or ise bharat kii ek aadhikarik bhashaa hone kaa maan bhi praapt he
 The Khwar language of Chitral district of Pakistan, the Sheena language spoken in northern Kashmir and the Pashai language spoken in eastern Nuristan, Nangarhar and Kuner states of Afghanistan are other famous Dardi languages
 isamen koi do raay nahin hai ki lagbhag sabhi dardi bhashaaon par sanskrit, farsi, punjabi, hindi-urdu ityadi kaa prabhaav padaa he or inke kai shabd dardi bhashaaon main istemaal hote hai
 But many linguists believe that Dardi languages too have left their mark on non-dardi hindi-aryan languages
 yah maananaa he ke punjabi, uttarakhand kii kuch boliyaan or kuch or bhashaaon par dardi kaa prabhaav nazar aata he
 While this continues to be disputed, there is a belief that in ancient times Dardi was spoken over a very large area which was spread around the Indus River and then in Himachal and Uttarakhand
 dardi bhashaaon kii kuch khaas chijen hai jinase samooche hind-arya bhashaa parivaar main unki pahchaan banati he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjanon kaa uccharan alpapraan vyanjanon jaisaa hota he 
 In most hid-aryan languages, aspiration consonants are spoken with airflow, such as the aspirated consonant 'b' is spoken by airflow while its corresponding hypnotic consonant 'a' has very little airflow
 Is spoken with
 aisa dardik bhashaaon main nahin he
 In these languages, the diacritic and mahaprana consonants are distinguished by changing the tone rather than the airflow
 misaal ke taur par jahaan sanskrit main 'bhoomi' shabd he vahaan khovaar bhashaa main 'buum' he jisame awaz mote swar se patale swar kii ore jaati he 
 In the same way, where there is 'smoke' from the great word 'd' in Hindi, there is 'dum' from the short word 'd' in Pashai
 sanskrit ke 'dugdh' ore hindi ke 'doodh' ke sthaan par kashmiri main 'dod' hota he
 In the same way in the western hill and Punjabi, there is a change of tone in place of mahaprana, as in Punjabi, instead of 'home' in Hindi, the vowel is the word 'kara'
 dardi bhashaaon main aksar shabdaansh sthanantaran ho jaataa he, jisame ek hi shabd ke 'r' ke varna ke ird-gird koi swar apane sthaan main pher-badal kar letaa he
 It has been in ancient times in the Dardi languages and can also be seen in the rocks of the era of Emperor Ashoka in Gandhara region, which were erected from 269 BC to 231 BC
 samraat ashok kii ek oopaadhi 'priyadarshi' thi - lekin in shilaon par aksar 'priyadrashi' dekhne ko miltaa he kyonki shabdaansh sthanantaran ke kaaran 'darsh' kaa 'drash' ban gaya
 Similarly, on these rocks, 'dharma' is found in place of 'dharma'
 aadhunik kaal main sanskrit ke 'deergh' shabd kii jhalak kalash bhashaaon ke 'drig' shabd main milti he
 In Palula language, 'weak' in Sanskrit becomes 'drubal' and in Sanskrit 'bhurj' it becomes 'barhuj'
 sanskrit kaa 'daridr' kashmiri kaa 'droled' ban jaataa he or 'karm' kashmiri main 'kram' ban jaataa he
 This trend of Dardi languages can also be seen to some extent in Punjabi and Western Pahari languages
 jahaan farsi main ped ko 'darakht' kehete hai vahaan punjabi main yah 'drakhat' ho jaataa he
 In most indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of a sentence
 lekin dardik bhashaaon main kriya shabd vaakya ke bich main aate hai
 In this case Dardi languages are like English
 upar likhe hue vaakyon main kriya ko gadhe aksharon main likhaa gaya he
 As is clear, in almost all indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of the sentence, but Dardic breaks this rule and puts the verb after the noun, as in English
 aisi bhashaaon ko jo kriya sangya ke baad daalati hon "kriya dwitiya bhashaayen" kaha jaataa he
 After the independence of Belarus from the Soviet Union, it redefined its national symbols before the Soviet era
 isamen laal or shwet pattiyon vaala ek dhvaj, ghode kii peeth par aakarman kii mudra main baitha shoorveer kaa kulchihn shaamil hai
 These national symbols were replaced by Soviet-era signs after the 1995 controversial vote
 raashtragan sahit in do chihnon ko sanvaidhanik rup se belarus ke rashtriya pratikon ke rup main shaamil kiya gaya he
 In the year 1994, Article 19 of the Constitution of Belarus lists the national symbols of the country
 anuchhed 19 ke anusaar: Each national symbol will be further defined by its rule
 rashtriya pratikon kaa upyog prayek pratik se sambandhit niyam main samahit hoga
 In the 1995 referendum, one of the two symbols was chosen as the national flag and has been in use since 7 June 1995
 dhvaj ke mukhya bhaag main laal or hare, do rangon ko prayukt kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, the part worn is embellished in another form
 vartmaan dhvaj 1951 ke dhvaj kaa aadhunikeekaran he jo desh ke soviet sangh ke ganraajya ke rup main tha
 In the Soviet version the hammer and sickle were located in the upper part of the hoist and the ornate colors have been turned upside down

 Despite being replaced, the old Belarus flag is used by opponents of the current Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko

 It was used after independence in 1991 from the Belarusian National Republic and the Soviet Union

 Originally, the classification of animals was called classics or 'taxonomy'
 kintu aajkal ise vyapak arth main prayog kiya jaataa he or jeev-jantuon ke vargeekaran sahit ise gyaan ke vividh kshetron main prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 Therefore, objects and principles can also be classified
 'vargiki' shabd do artho main prayukt hota he - Just as written papers related to different work in offices are kept in separate files, similarly it is necessary for study that animals and plants of different castes are placed in different categories
 is tarah jantuon or padap ke vargeekaran ko vargiki, yaa vargeekaran vigyaan kehete hai
 In English, two terms are used for taxonomy, one is taxonomy and the other is systematics
 texonomi shabd greek shabd "taxis", jiskaa arth he kram se rakhana or "nomos", jiskaa arth he niyam, ke jod se hua he
 Hence the meaning of taxonomy is the rule of keeping order
 san 1813 main candol ne is shabd kaa prayog padap vargeekaran ke liye kiya tha
 Systematics is derived from the word "systema"
 yah latin-greek shabd he
 It was used by early naturalists for the classification system
 karl liniyas ne 1735 i
 main ""systema nachuri"" naamak pustak systematics shabd ke aadhaar par likhi thi
 In the modern era both these terms are used for plant and animal classification
