 haalanki yah isi naam kii shrankhla kaa pehla game he, par isaki ghatnaayen kalkrmanusaar ise duusare number kaa game banaati he
 Its events occur after Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening and before Devil May Cry 2 and Devil May Cry 4
 game kii kahani aadhunik kaal main ek kaalpanik dweep malett par dante va trish ke kirdaaron ke ird-gird ghumti he jo shaitan samrath mundus kaa muqaabala karne ke liye uski khoj main hai
 The story is told primarily through a mix of cutscenes that use the game's engine and several previously rendered full-motion videos
 devil me krai ne video game media main pramukh kawarej praapt kiya, peshewar samikshakon se ucch samgr score or ab tak isaki bees lakh pratiyaan bik chuki hai
 The game has different missions where the player encounters a variety of enemies, solve difficult challenges and solve puzzles to keep the story moving
 khiladi ko uske khilne ke dhang ke anusaar greads milte hai
 "stylish" battles are created when multiple attacks are made simultaneously without stopping and the player's skill is seen accumulating in the miter on the screen
 khiladi jitna ladta he metre utana badhata chalata he
 The miter initially is "dal", then changes to "cool", "bravo", "ausam" and ultimately "stylish"
 chot lagane par metre waapas girnaa shuru ho jaataa he
 The player can retain his style by miter enemies
 khiladi asthaayee taur par khud ko "devil trigar" ki madad se ek shaitan main badal saktaa he jisase khel main uskaa rup badal jaataa he or hatiyaar or takadavar ban jate hai
 It is limited until the Devil Trigger Miter is over and has to be fought as a refill to fill it
 devil me krai main kain paheliyaan he
 Sometimes it is necessary to solve them to move forward in the story
 yah concept capcom ke racidant ivil game se miltaa julata he
 Devil May Cry begins when Trish attacks a mysterious woman in Dante's office
 dante uske waar ko aasaani se jaaya karke use prabhavit kar detaa he or use bataata he ki vah shaitano kaa shikaar karata he unki talash main jinhone uske bhai or mo kaa kun kiya he
 Trish then tells him that the attack was meant to test him and Satan is preparing to return Samantha Mundus, whom Dante considers responsible for his family's death
 phir drushya unke ek vishaal kile main pahunchane se shuru hota he jahaan trish achaanak oonchi divaar phaand kar gaayab ho jaati he
 While investigating the fort, Dante encounters a large number of devilish puppets in the game
 use ek nai "alastor" naam ki talwaar milti he or phir uskaa saamana game ke pehle bos phentom se hota he jo ek vishaal makadi or bichhchhu se bana shaitan he
 This fight goes on like Dante, but again, he repeatedly encounters Phantom in the corridors of the fort
 aage or chanbin karne ke baat dante kaa saamana nilo ellilo naam ke shaitan se hota he jo dante ko apane saahas se prabhavit karata he
 In this battle, Satan wins, but seeing the half-talisman hanging in Dante's neck, he runs away
 khel main aage do baar or shaitan hamalaa karata he or tab dante ko pataa chalata he ki vah shaitan uskaa judwa bhai virgil he
 After Virgil's death, half of his neck amulets are joined by Dante's amulets and the game's default sword, "force Edge", which was the drink of both, translates into its true form "sparda"
 jab dante trish se waapas miltaa he tab trish use dhokaa de detii he or bataati he ki mundus ke liye kaam karti he, par jab uski jaan khatre main pads jaati he tab dante use yah kah kar bachaa kaa letaa he ki uski shkal dante ki mo se milti he or use aagaah karata he ki usase dur rahe
 Later, when he is confronted by Mundus who is about to kill Trish, Dante again saves his life and gets injured in the mutt
 mundus maukey kaa phayda uthaa kar usapar waar karata he par is baar trish bich main aakar waar apane upar le leti he
 Seeing this, Dante emerges completely and turns into a Sparda
 dante or mundus phir ek dusri vaastaviktaa main ladte hai
 Dante wins and returns to his normal form by placing his talisman and sword near Trish's body before leaving
 par isse pehle ki dante vdip se nikle, mundus waapas aakar use gher letaa he
 Then Trish comes and gives power to Dante
 dante mundus ko haraa detaa he jo jate jate waapas laut kar aane ki kasam letaa he
 When Trish tries to apologize to Dante, her tears come out, which Dante tells her that she is no longer a devil, has become a human being because "the devils never cry"
 dante or trish ek plane ke sahare vdip se batch nikalate hai or vdip samandar main samaa jaataa he

 Kamiya was not satisfied with some of the character's scenes and decided to use the dynamic camera system, leaving behind the already developed backdrop of the Resident Evil series

 Despite several attempts, he could not put this Thim in Resident Evil without losing his identity and Mikami asked the staff to develop a new game from it
 kamia ne puri kahani waapas likhi jise shaitanon se bhari duniya main rachaa gaya or hero kaa naam badal kar dante kar diya
 According to the script of most of the characters Sugimura, the character of the parents of Hiro Bhi Hiro was re-cast

 History of ancient Egypt By the late Paleolithic period, the arid climate of North Africa became increasingly hot and dry, forcing the region's population to migrate to the shores of the Nile Valley and nomadic moderns from the late Middle Pleistocene about 120 thousand years ago
 Human hunters began living in the area, the Nile River has been the lifeline of Egypt ever since

 Shri Arvind made an important contribution to the thinking of Indian education

 He believed that human beings can transform their psyche into 'very psyche' and 'very human' while living a physical life and serving other human beings
 shiksha dwaara yah sambhav he
 In today's circumstances, when we are following the materialistic civilization by forgetting our ancient civilization, culture and tradition, the education philosophy of Arvind instructs us in the right direction
 aaj dharmik evam aadhyatmik jagriti kii nitant aavashyaktaa he
 In the words of Shri VR Taneja- rashtriya aandolan main lage hue vidhyaarthiyon ko shaikshik suvidhaayen pradaan karne hetu kalakatta main ek rashtriya mahavidhyalay sthapit kiya gaya
 Shri Arvind was appointed as the Principal of this college at a salary of Rs
 150 per month
 is avasar kaa laabh uthaate hue shri aravind ne 'rashtriya shiksha' kii sankalpana kaa vikaas kiya tathaa apane shiksha-darshan kii aadharshila rakhi
 This college later developed into Jadavpur University
 pradhanacharya kaa kaary karte hue shri aravind apane lekhan tathaa bhaashanon dwaara deshavaasiyon ko prerana dete hue rajnatik gatividhiyon main bhaag lete rahe
 In 1908, Shri Arvind was arrested and kept in jail for participating in the national movement
 un par mukadmaa chalaaya gaya tathaa adaalat main daivayog se unke mukademe kii sunwaayee saishan jaj si pi bichcraft ne kii jo aravind ke ICS ke sahpaathee rah chuke the tathaa aravind kii kushagra buddhi se prabhavit the
 Arvind's lawyer Chittaranjan Das told Judge Beechcraft - "when you are impressed with Arvind's intelligence, how is it possible that Arvind can participate in any conspiracy?" Beach Craft frees Arvind from prison
 jail kii avadhi main shri aravind ne aadhyatmik sadhana kii tathaa unhen ishwariya gyaan praapt hua
 Earlier, when he was in Baroda in 1907, a famous yogi Vishnu Bhaskar came in contact with Lele and started practicing yoga
 jail se mukt hokar ve 4 april 1910 ko pandicherry chale gayi or unhone apana jivan anant satya kii khoj main laga diya
 Through continuous practice, he developed his spiritual philosophical ideology
 shri aravind ke darshan kaa lakshya "udaatt satya kaa gyaan" he jo "samgr jivan-drushti" dwaara praapt hota he
 The overall life-vision develops when a person is absorbed or unified in the Brahman
 ishwar ke prati purna samarpan dwaara maanav `ati maanav' ban jaataa he arthath vah sat, raj va tam kii pravriti se upar uthakar gyani ban jaataa he
 In a superhuman condition, a person considers all beings as his own
 jab vyakti shaareerik, maansik tathaa atmik drushti se ekaakaar ho jaataa he to usamen daivi shakti kaa pradurbhaav hota he
 Arvind has given more emphasis on yoga practice for a holistic view of life
 yoga dwaara maansik shanti evam santosh praapt hota he
 In the view of Arvind, yoga does not mean abandoning life, but faithfully facing the problems and challenges of life, believing in divine power
 aravind kii drushti main yoga kathin asana va pranayam kaa abhyaas karnaa bhi nahin he balki ishwar ke prati nishkaam bhav se aatm samarpan karnaa tathaa maansik shiksha dwaara swayan ko daivi swaroop main parinit karnaa he
 Arvind has clarified the notion of the brain, saying that the mind-level of the brain is the mind, mind, intellect and intuition, which develop gradually
 arntagyaan main vyakti ko agyaan se sandesh praapt hote hai jo brahm gyaan ke armbh kii parichaayak he
 Arvind has given special importance to Arntigyan
 arntagyaan dwaara hi maanavtaa pragati kii vartmaan dasha ko pahaunchi he
 Therefore, Arvind insists that the teacher should not suppress the talent of his disciple by routine work
 vartmaan shiksha paddati se aravind kaa asantosh isi kaaran tha ki unamem vidhyaarthiyon kii pratibha ke vikaas kaa avasar nahin diya jaataa
 The teacher should adopt a liberal approach towards the development of the talent of the students from a psychological point of view
 aravind kii mastishk kii dharna kii parinti `atimanas' kii kalpana va uske astitv main he
 Superman is a higher level of consciousness and a form of divine self-power
 atimanas kii sthiti tak shanai: shanai: pahunchnaa hi shiksha kaa lakshya hona chahie
 According to Arvind, there are three characteristics of Indian talent - enlightenment, prolificness and intelligence
 aravind ne deshavaasiyon main inhen pracheen aadhyatmik shaktiyon ke vikaas karne kaa sandesh dekar bhartiya punarjagran karnaa chaha he
 In the words of Arvind- is prakaar shri aravind ke darshan kii charam parinti unke shaikshik darshan main hoti he
 Every philosopher is ultimately an academician because education is the dynamic side of philosophy
 jaisaa ki abhi ham dekh chuke hai - aravind ke darshan kii charam parinti unke shiksha-darshan main hui he
 He was dissatisfied with the current system of education
 unka kahana tha- This knowledge is only the beginning of new research and future activities
 ve aaj kii shiksha-paddati main bhartiya pratibha kii teen visheshtaon-aadhyatmikta, sarjanaatmakataa tathaa budhimatta- kaa hraas evam patan dekhte the
 He considered the cause of this downfall as sick spirituality
 aravind kii shiksha paddati kii sankalpana- aravind is prakaar kii shikshapaddati chaahate the jo vidhyaarthee ke gyaan-kshetra kaa vistaar kare, jo vidhyaarthiyon kii smriti, nirnayan shakti evam sarjanaatmak kshamta kaa vikaas kare tathaa jiskaa madhyam maatrubhaasha ho
 Shri Arvind was of national views, so he wanted to mold the education system according to Indian tradition
 unhone shiksha dwaara punarjagran kaa sandesh diya tha
 This renaissance should be oriented towards three directions: - pracheen aadhyatm-gyaan kii purnsthapana; Use of this spiritual knowledge in philosophy, literature, art, science and critical knowledge; And vartmaan samasyaon kaa bhartiya aatm-gyaan kii drushti se samaadhaan kii khoj tathaa aadhyatm pradhan samaaj kii sthapana
 According to Shri Arvind "the main goal of education is to be helpful in the all round development of the developing soul and to enable it to be used for higher ideals
 " arvind ke vichaar mahatma gandhi dwaara pratipaadit shiksha ke lakshyon ke samaan hai
 Arvind believed that the aim of education is to awaken a person's belief that he is capable of mental and spiritual vision and that he is coming into a state of supernaturalism
 shiksha dwaara vyakti kii anternihit bauddhik evam naitik kshamtaaon kaa sarvocch vikaas hona chahie
 Arvind believed that human beings are aligned with divine power and the goal of education is to develop this consciousness power
 isiilie ve mastishk ko 'chhathi gyanendriya' maanate the
 The purpose of education should be to teach these six senses to use them properly
 unhone kaha tha ki-"mastishk kaa ucchtam seemaa tak purna prashikshan hona chahie anyathaa balak apurna tathaa ekangi rah jaayegaa
 Therefore, the goal of education is to use superman for the integrated development of human personality
 " Regarding the course of education, Arvind wanted that instead of imparting superficial knowledge of many subjects, students should be studied only in a few selected subjects
 ve bhartiya itihaas evam samskruti ko paathyakram kaa abhinn ang maanate the kyonki unka vichaar tha ki prayek balak main itihaas bodh hota he jo parikthaon, khel va khilaunon ke madhyam se prakat hota he
 Therefore, children should develop interest towards the literature and history of their country
 aravind ke anusaar prayek vyakti main jigyaasa, khoj, vishleshan va sanshleshan karne kii pravriti hoti he
 Therefore, he used to place science in the curriculum
 vigyaan dwaara maanav prakritik vaataavaran ko samajhataa he tathaa usamen vastunisht buddhi ke vikaas hetu anushaasan aata he
 Due to giving primacy to the brain, Arvind also wanted to include the subject of psychology in the curriculum so that a 'holistic life-vision' could be developed
 isi uddeshy se ve paathyakram main darshan evam tarkshastra ko bhi sthaan dete the
 Arvind wanted to develop the child's intellectual development as well as his moral and religious development
 unki dharna thi- "maanav kii maansik pravriti naitik pravriti par aadhaarit he
 Intellectual education, devoid of moral and emotional progress, is harmful to humans
 " naitik shiksha hetu aravind guru kii pracheen bhartiya parampara ke pakshdhar the jisamen guru, shishy kaa mitra, path pradarshak tathaa sahaayak ho saktaa tha
 It is only through discipline that students can build good habits
 naitik "sansuchan vidhi" dwaara di jaani chahie jisamen guru vyaktigat adarsh jivan evam pracheen mahapurushon ke udhaaharan dwaara vidhyaarthiyon ko naitik vikaas hetu utprerit kare
 According to Arvind, teaching is a science through which changes in the behavior of students are inevitable
 unke shabdon main- "vaastavik shikshan kaa pratham siddhanth he ki kuch bhi padhaanaa sambhav nahin arthath baahar se shikshaarthi ke mastishk par koi cheez na thopi jaye
 The learning process should give proper direction to the brain activity of the learner
 " prayek vidhyaarthee ko vyaktigat abhivritti evam yogyata ke anukool shiksha deni chahie
 Students should get opportunities for development according to their tendency ie "swadharma"
 aravind 'maanas' arthath mastishk ko chhathi gyanendriya maanate the jiske vikaas par ve adhik bal dete the
 The developed psyche produces a 'subtle vision' from which an impartial attitude develops
 yoga dwaara 'chitt shuddhi' shikshan kaa lakshya hona chahie
 According to Arvind, the same teacher can do effective teaching which will develop the student through the above method
 shikshit vidhyaarthiyon ko gyanendriyon tathaa mastishk ke sahi upyog dwaara unki paryvekshan, avdhaan, nirnay tathaa samaran shakti kaa vikaas karne main sahaayta kare
 Teaching children to develop insights by developing reasoning power
 aravind shikshak kaa mahatv prakat karte hue kehete the ki- Argon is a chemical element
