aaj kisi vishesh upyog ke liye icchit gunonvali mishradhatuen banaai jaati he
 When metals dissolve in a common solution, such as an acid, they give off their metallic properties and normally form salts, but when melted they dissolve along with their metallic properties
 dhaatuon ke aise thos vilyan ko mishradhatu kehete hai
 Non-metals are also small in many alloys, but the quality of the whole remains metallic
 at: 1939 i0 main america vastu pareekshak parishad ne mishradhatu kii nimnlikhit paribhaasha kii- Initially, the alloy was used most for making coins and ornaments
 taanbe ke sikkon main tanba, tin or jasta kramash: 95 / 4 tathaa 1 pratishat rahete hai
 Until 1920, silver coins in England were made of 'sterling' silver, with silver and copper being 92
5 and 7
5 percent respectively
 america main chaandi ke sabhi sikkon main chaandi or tanba kramash: 90 tathaa 10 pratishat hote hai
 Gold and copper in England's gold coins are 91
67 and 8
33 percent respectively, and gold coins in the United States are 90 percent gold and other metals, especially copper
 platinayam, sona tathaa chaandi ke aabhushanon ke rango main sundarataa laane ke liye unako kathor, majboot tathaa tikaoo banane ke liye, yaa unhen saste mulyon main vikray ke liye duusari dhaatuon ke saath milakar kaam main laate hai
 Determining whether alloys are simple mixtures or chemical compounds is a complex problem
 kuch arthon main ye rasinic yogic hai, kyonki jab sodium saras banaaya jaataa he, tab sodium ke har ek tukade ko paar main daalane se prakaash kii teevr jwaala nikalati he or paara garam ho jaataa he, yah yogic banane kaa lakshan he
 Similarly, when a piece of aluminum metal is added to the melting gold, so much heat is generated that the entire molten metal becomes brighter
 anek mishra dhaatuon kaa rang apane avyav dhaatuon ke rangon se bilkul bhinn hota he
 For example, both silver and zinc are white, but the alloy they make is very beautiful pink
 sona pilaa or aluminium shwet hota he, kintu inaki mishradhatu kaa rang ati chamkila nillohit hota he
 This property also has compounds
 mishradhaatuon ke galnaank nikaalane par gyaat hua he ki mishra dhaatuon kaa vyavhaar do prakaar kaa he: kuch mishradhaatuon kaa galnaank jaise jaise kisi avyav dhaatu kii maatra badalati hai vaise-vaise badalata he, yah mishran kaa gun he or kuch mishradhaatuon kaa galnaank ek sthir taap hota he, jo prakat karata he ki mishradhatuen yogic hai
 The physical and chemical properties of alloys differ from the properties of their constituent metals, and the properties of alloys are by no means comparable to the properties of element metals
 yah bhinnata is kaaran se he ki jab dhaatuon ko ek saath pighalaate hai, tab ve kitne hi antaradhaatuk yogic tathaa thos vilyan banaati hai
 The density of an alloy can be less or greater than the mean density of its constituent metals
 kuch mishradhaatuon kaa rang apni avyav dhaatuon ke rangon se bilkul hi bhinn hota he
 They are harder than their constituent metals, but less flexible and malleable and more brittle
 mishradhaatuon kaa galnaank sarvada adhiktam taap par pighalanevaali avyavdhaatu ke galnaank se bhi kam hota he
 And usually at a minimum temperature the melting element is less than the melting point of the metal
 udaahranarth, ek mishradhatu, jisamen sisa, tin, bismuth tathaa cadmium hai, 75 ̊sein0 par galati he, jab ki nunatam taap par pighalane vaali avyav-dhaatu, tin kaa galnaank 232 ̊ sein0 he
 All these are the properties due to which alloys become more valuable than pure metals and prove more useful in industry
 upar varnit falon dwaara tathaa sookshmdarshi, eks-kiran varnakram maapi, ooshmiya tathaa rasinic vishleshan or duusare bhautik pareekshanon dwaara mishradhaaton ke sanghathan tathaa crystalia rachana ke vistrut adhyayan ke parinamswaroop, mishradhaatuon ko teen shreniyon main rakhaa gaya he
 This division has been done on the basis of how the group of atoms of the constituent metals in the alloys is organized
 ye teen shreniyan nimnlikhit hai: In these types of alloys, when the element metals are molten, they dissolve in each other, but when solid, the crystals of the metals break apart, that is, the metals are insoluble
 is prakaar mishradhatu prayek avyav dhaatu ke shuddh crystal kaa mishran hoti he or thanda karne par koi ek avyav dhaatu thos rup main pruthak ho jaati he
 For example, a liquid alloy consisting of only 10 parts lead and 90 parts tin, when cooled, pure tin crystals are first separated in the same way as pure ice crystals cooled from a dilute solution of sugar
 Are separate jis taap par tin ke crystal pruthak hona prarambh karte he, vah taap shuddh tin ke galnaank se kam hota he
 When the melting point of the tin is dissolved in the lead, the molecular weight of the lead is determined by the same rule by which the molecules of the dissolved substances in the water are removed
 is vidhi se un kai dhaatuon kaa anubhaar nikaala gaya he, jo tanughatvik vilyan main alag parmaanu ke rup main rahati he
 Lead-antimony alloys belong to the mixture category
 antimony bhangur hota he or sisa mulaayam
 The printing metal is a alloy of CC, antimony and a very small amount of tin
 is mishradhatu main antimony kii kathorta to hoti he, kintu yah uski tarah bhangur nahin hoti
 In this type of alloys, the atoms of one element metal fit well in the crystalline structure of the other element metal
 thos vilyan shrenee kii mishradhatuen do bhinn prakaar kii hoti he: Many copper-nickel alloys that have significant use fall under the category of solid solutions
 udaahranarth, ve mishradhatuen jinase nikal ke sikke, rifl kii goliyon kii tapiyaan or ek taar jiskaa vaidyut pratirodh adhik hota he, banataa he
 Many of the Canadian minerals contain copper and nickel sulfides, which are smelted to form an alloy

 This alloy is called monel metal
 yah adhik tanya, lacheelee tathaa sanksharan pratirohak hoti he
 Generally, metals do not form compounds by mixing with each other, but by heat analysis it has been found that metals combine with each other to form a large number of compounds
 in yogicon kaa vargeey naam antaradhaatuk yogic he
 Most compounds of this type form alkali and alkaline clay metals, by combining them with the metals of the odd subclass of the periodic table
 in yogicon main dhaatuen kis maatra main mili hui hai, isko rasinic sutron dwaara darshaate hai
 It is known from the study of these formulas that these types of compounds violate all the laws of valency that are formed by the compounds formed by the combination of metals and non-metals
 udaahranarth, sodium, tin or sisa ke saath rasinic kriya kar nimnlikhit yogic banaata he : Many interstitial compounds are very stable and do not dissolve their constituents in metals even when heated to temperatures higher than their melting point
 ye yogic taral ammonia main ghulte hai or is prakaar se jo vilyan taiyaar hota he, vah vaidyut chaalak hota he
 When they are electrically decomposed, one component metal, which is less positive than the other, accumulates on the positive and the other on the minuscule
 antaradhaatuk yogic kyon banaata he, isaki abhi tak saidhantik vyakhya nahin hui
 Only so far it has been proved that those metals, which have the same properties, do not coincide with each other
 chunki is prakaar kii mishradhatuen kathor, bhangur, bahut hi kam tanyashil tathaa lacheelee hoti hai, at: inamen se keval kuch hi upyogi hai

 baad main, ek antariksh yaan utarataa he or ek unnat jaanch ke liye EVE naamak robot ko tainaat karata he
 WALL-E goes mad in love with EVE, who was instructed to search for signs of plant life

 In the repair ward, WALL-E makes a mistake in inspecting for eve's torture and breaking it in an attempt to liberate him, but his clumsiness is the sole cause of this entire mess and accidentally he is forced into the clutches of a bad robot
 Leaves to roam in; The result was that he was hired to protect the vehicle and EVE was considered a "naughty robot"
 WALL-E kii ashaantikaarak karrwai se naaraaz hokar tathaa paudhe ko usne churaayaa yaa kho diya aisa maan kar, EVE escape pod ke jariye use waapas prithvi main bhejne kaa prayaas karti he
 However, they noticed that Auto's partner GO-4 had stored the missing plant in their pod for planned auto-destruction, launched within WALL-E, though WALL-E damaged the plant Succeeded in getting out from there

 The captain reviews the visual record of the destroyed Earth of EVE and vows to return to restore the planet as it was before
 EVE bhi apana suraksha record dekhati he ki uske band ho jane ke baad WALL-E prithvi ke kathin vaataavaran se ni:swaarth bhav se uski raksha karata he; vah WALL-E ke prem se itani prabhavit hoti he ki use ehsaas hota he ki vah phir se usase prem karne lagati he
 Before the Captain activates the Holo-detector, Auto states that he was given the final instructions to save mankind in space, as the Earth was deemed unfit for habitation at that time
 jab captain apana nirdesh use prithvi waapas lautne ke liye detaa he to auto baghawat karte hue captain ko uske quarter main band kar WALL-E ko bijli kaa jhatka dekar EVE or paudhe ke saath kachare kii pravanika main bhej detaa he
 With the dying WALL-E, EVE realizes that there is only one part available that can protect it on Earth, so WALL-E and EVE run away from the garbage depot to MO and help the plant in Holo-detectors with bad robots By activating the vehicle's hyperjump to return to Earth
 captain apane quarter kii kaid se apane aapako mukt kar letaa he or auto se ladate hue holo sansuchak ko kholta he, captain dwaara ise niskriy karne se pehle auto ne isse WALL-E ko kuchal kar maar daalane ke liye band kar diya tha, kyonki use khulaa rakhane kii koshish karata he
 Freeing WALL-E, EVE puts the plant in the Holo-detector and sends the vehicle back to Earth to take wall-e's body to her home for repair
 EVE safaltaapurvak use phir se sakriy kar detii he, lekin durbhagyavash WALL-E kii samaran-shakti or vyaktitv mit chuki hoti he kyonki vah phir se kachra jamaa karne ke apane mul kaam main lag jaataa he
 Desperate EVE took her in his hands and gave her a kiss, giving him a shock that unexpectedly brought him back to normal, the two robots reunite happily
 WALL-E or EVE maanav or robot ko phir se jodate hai or prithvi ko uski purv sthiti main lautaa laane ke liye ekasaath milakar kaam karne lagate hai or unhen waapas unke ghar laane vaale ankuran ko ropane ke liye uski dekhbhaal karte hai
 While showing gratitude, various forms of art are used to make the Earth green again, starting with Egyptian cave painting hieroglyphics and Greek jug drawings to The Vinci and finally impressionism
 kala se pataa chalata he ki ghaas, paudhon or jaanwaron se puri tarah hare-bhare vishwa ke rup main shahar kaa punarnirmaan ho rahaa he
 Human beings have also returned to their actual body structure
 antim drishy main film main dikhaaya jaataa he ki WALL-E or EVE ek ped ke paas khadey hai, yah vahi ped he jisane prithvi ko phir se basaanaa shuru kiya tha
 BACK ON MO AND WALLY MO just finishes cleaning the floor
wally is fascinated
impishly makes another mark
mo compulsively cleans it
 Can't resist
mo: Wally wipes the bottom of his tread on m-o's face
mo loses it
scrubs his own face
 1994 main andru stanton ne WALL-E kii kalpana apane sahyogi lekhakon jon laster, peet doctor or jo ranft ke saath din ke khaane dauraan kii gayi
 Toy Story was nearing completion and the next project in the minds of the authors - a Bug's Life, Monsters, Inc
 And the idea of fiding Nemo was killing the hawl at lunchtime
 stanton ne poocha, "agar maanavjaati ko prithvi chhodana pad jaae or aakhri robot ko koi band karnaa bhul jaae to kaisaa ho?" twoy story ko aakarshak banane ke liye iske paatro ke nirmaan main varshon maathapai karne vaale stanton ko ek nirjan grah main nipat akele robot ke liye robinsan crusoyi idia prabhaavshaalee tha
 Stanton made WALL-E a garbage collector, since the idea was absolutely clean and because it was a low-level job, he was sympathetic
 stanton ko kaalpanik kachare ke dher kaa kyub bhi bahut pasand aayaa
 He did not find this idea very useless, because it was very childish for him to imagine a disaster like a planet being washed away by garbage
 1995 main do maheene main stanton or peet doctor ne film ko tresh planet sheershak ke tahat viksit kiya, lekin unhen pataa nahin tha ki kahani ko kaise viksit karen or doctor ne monstors ink ke bajaay ise nirdeshit karne ke liye chunaa
 The idea of WALL-E getting a plant comes to Stanton, as his lonely life in a deserted world reminds Stanton of a plant growing on the sidewalk
 isse pehle ki ve anya pariyojnaon par dhyaan dete, stanton or lassetter ko WALL-E ke prem main pad jane kaa vichaar aata he, kyonki akelepan se baahar aane ke liye yah aavashyak kadi thi
 Stanton began writing WALL-E again in 2002 after completing Finding Nemo
 stanton ne patakatha kaa sanrup don o'benon ke alian jaisaa hi rakhaa
 Stanton found that o'bannon had written his screenplay in a way that would remind Haiku, where the scene was narrated through continuous lines of some words
 stanton ne robot ke dialog paaramparik rup main hi likhaa, lekin unhen koshthak main daal diya
 In late 2003, Stanton and a few others produced a story reel of the first twenty minutes of the film
 lassetter or steve jobs prabhavit hue or aadhikarik taur par kaam shuru hua, haalanki jobs ne bataaya ki unhen sheershak pasand nahin aayaa, jisaki vartanee pehle "W
A
L
-E
 " thi
 While wall-e's first act for Stanton was "fail Out of the Sky", although they first wanted EVE to leave the aliens there to explore the Earth, and the film would have been very different
 When the Axiom arrives, WALL-E, like Spartacus, makes robots revolt against the remnants of mankind, these remnants were brutal alien prisons
 a physiologist named James Hicks told Stanton about the concept of attenuation and the impact of prolonged weightlessness on humans living long enough in space
 so, maanav jati ke alian jail main apbhrasht hone main yahi prerana rahi, or planet of da eps kii styl kii samaapti main unke vansh kaa pataa chalata he
 Jails also speak in a gibberish language, but Stanton rejected the idea because he thought that it would make it harder for the audience to understand, and that they could easily deviate from the story
 jail kaa ek shahi parivaar tha, jo yaan ke peeche jhil par bane mahal main ek nrity kii mejabani karata he or is kahani ke avataran main prithvi kii ore lautate samay exiom sikudakar ek gend kii tarah gol ban jaataa he
 Stanton decided it was too bizarre and unattractive and imagined humanity as "big Babies"
 Stanton again developed the figurative theme to stand up and "mature", wishing that wall-e's EVE relationship inspired humanity because he felt that very few films have figured out how to dream Cosmic societies came into existence
 avarohi maanavtaa ke chithran kii prakriya jis tarah se pradarshit kii gayi he vah bahut hi dhimi he
 Stanton first decided to make Gels' nose and ears, so that viewers could recognize him
 Eventually, fingers, legs, clothes, and other features were added until the audience could see themselves in the character, so as to arrive at the fetus-like concept
 film ke baad ke sanskaran main, EVE ke paudhe ko waapas lene ke liye auto docking be aata he
 The film's first cutaway was on Captain, but Stanton thought it would be too early to start moving away from wall-e's point of view
 get smart ko ek shradhanjali ke rup main, auto paudha le jaataa he or yaan ke andar mastishk sadrush ek kamare main jaataa he, jahaan vah varshon se gandagi kaa dher bani prithvi kii saafe-safai kii vistrut yojana ko video main dekhtaa he
 Stanton removed it, so that it remained a mystery as to why the plant was taken away from EVE
 captain naasamajh prathit ho rahaa tha, lekin stanton use nirvirodh dekhnaa chaahate the, anyathaa vah gaiyr-sahanubhutisheel ho jaataa
 pehle captain kis tarah murkh darshaya gaya tha, iskaa ek udhaaharan yah he ki usne apni topi ulti pahan rakhi thi, auto ko chunauti dene se pehle hi usne use thik kiya
 In the sophisticated film, he is wearing a cap in a simple manner, he wears it tightly when his full command is placed on the Axiom
 armbh main, auto dwaara EVE ko bijli ke karant se maar daalaa gaya tha or phir badi shighrata se WALL-E dwaara WALL-A robot ke haathon ijection karke use bachaa liya jaataa he
 He then revives her by replacing her energy unit in a cigarette lighter brought from Earth
 2007 ke ek pareekshan screening ke baad stanton ne ise badal diya, kyonki ve ki WALL-E kii marammat ke baad EVE dwaara captain ke paas paudha laane ke uske nirdesh ko badalte hue dikhaanaa chaahate the or isse ghayal hone ke baavjood holo-detector ko kholane kii koshish main WALL-E or bhi adhik bahadur dikhataa
 stanton wo pal badal dete hai jab palaayan se pehle ek kothri se utpaadit apane paudhe ko prakat karata he, isse EVE khush hoti he or donon prasann hokar yaan ke chaaron ore nrity karne lagate hai
 Stanton felt that at the time of the screening half the audience was convinced that humans would be unable to live on Earth and would die after the end of the film
 Jim Capobianco, the director of the short film Your Friend the Rat, created the ending credits animation, which continued the story — and stylized the various artistic ups and downs throughout history — to remain an optimistic trend
 monstors ink
 ke baad WALL-E sabase jatil pikur production he, kyonki duniya or itihaas ke bare main sampreshit karnaa tha
 While most of Pixar's films were 75,000 storyboards, WALL-E required 125,000
 Production designer Rafal Eggleston wanted the lighting of the first scene of the Earth to be very romantic, while the second scene was a sad and lifeless Axiom
 During the third scene, romantic lighting was gradually introduced into the Axiom environment
 pikur ne tabaahi kii duniya rachane ke liye ke liye cheranobil or sophia shahar kaa adhyayan kiya; kala nirdeshak antony christove bulgaria ke the or unhone sophia main vahaan ke kachare ko ikattha karne kii samasyaon ko yaad kiya
 Eggleston bleached the whitewash on Earth to make WALL-E feel insecure, so that he would need to wear sunglasses to avoid strong sunlight
 High bright light makes the location look more wide
 aspashtataa kii vajah se, cubs ke kachare ke tower bahut bade lagane lagate hai, anyathaa unke aakaar adrusht ho jate 
 prithvi kaa sust pilaa-bhura rang EVE ke aagaman ke saath sookshmata se halkaa gulabi or nila ho jaataa he
 The material stored in the truck in which WALL-E resides when it is seen to EVE, then its accumulated light burns up and creates an inviting atmosphere, like a Christmas tree
 Eggleston tried to avoid yellow and green, so that WALL-E - which had created a yellow color to emulate the tractor - did not mix with the uninhabited earth and the plant became more prominent
 stanton bhi chaahate the ki prakaash vyavastha yathartwaadee dikhe or unhone apane yuvakal kii vigyaan filmon kii yaad taaja kii
 He thought that Pixar used nature lore for underwater scenes for Finding Nemo, so he wanted to use it in space for WALL-E
 apni kuch pasandida kaalpanik vigyaan filmein phir se dekhte samay unhen mahasoos hua ki pikur kii filmein 70 mem filmon jaisi nahin dikhti or iske alaava bairal virupan, lens kaa damakna tathaa kshtdaayi focus bhi unhen khatka
 nirmaataa gym morris ne prakaash vyavastha or vaataavaran par salaah lene ke liye roger dickins or denis muren ko aamantrit kiya
 Muren spent several months with Pixar, while Dickins hosted a talk and was requested to stay two weeks
 stanton ne kaha ki muren ke anubhav live-ection settings main ekikrut computer anemeshan main kaam aaye, jabaki dickins ne unhen camera-kaaryon or prakaash vyavastha main bahut adhik jatilta se bachane ko samajhane main madad kii
 Animators were helped by using 1970s Panavision cameras in such a way that they could understand and not replicate ambiguous backgrounds such as hand work in a digital environment
 WALL-E kii ek tri-aiami pratikruti ke liye pehle prakaash pareekshan main ek imaarat ko shaamil kiya gaya, iske filmakan main 70 mem camere kaa istemaal hua or phir computer main ise dohraane kii koshish kii gayi
 Stanton cited the light lens of Gus Van Sant's films as an influence, as it created each close-up with intimacy
 stanton ne abhaasi camaron ke liye aise konon ko chunaa, jinhen kisi set par filmaate hue koi live-ection film nirmaataa chunaa karata he
 Stanton wanted Axiom's interior to resemble Shanghai and Dubai
 egalstone ne exiom ke liye 1950 or '60s ke dashak kii nasa kii paintings tathaa tumoroland kii kala kii avadharana kaa adhyayan kiya, taaki yug kii ashavad kii bhaavana darshaya ja sake
 Stanton explained that "we probably had a lot in our background here, that we were missing Tomorrowland, which we were promised by Disneyland," and we wanted a "jet pack" experience
 pikur ne dijani krooj line kaa bhi adhyayan kiya or las vegas kii yatra kii, jisase kritrim prakaash vyavastha ko samajhane main madad mili
 Eggleston made Santiago Calatrova's state-of-the-art and relaxing architecture the basis of Axiom's design
 egalstone ne yaan ke bhitari bhaag ko teen khandon main vibhajit kiya; peeche kii kifayati class kii buniyadi banaavat bhure kancreet jaisi, saath hi bnl logo kii graphics laal, nila or safed
 coach class main 'S' aakaar ke living / shouping sthal banaaye gayi, jaisaa ki log baraabar hi dekha karte hai ki "whats around da corner"
 stanton anek rangeen pratik chaahate rahe the, lekin unhone mahasoos kiya ki isse darshakon ko pareshaani hogi, so unhone kam sankhya main bade pratik lagane ke egalstone ke moulik vichaar ke saath jane kaa faisla kiya
 The premier class at the front was designed to be a large Zen-like spa, using only turquoise, cream and yellow-brown color, leading to the captain's warm carpet and wooden chambers and a smooth dark bridge
 kritrim exiom ke saath talmail banaaye rakhane ki liye, camera gatividhi ko steedicam kii tarah model kiya gaya
 Hello, dolly! By deciding to show live action footage from the film, Stanton continued the parable of showing historical, ordinary humans in live action footage, while his bloated lineage was created in the rest of the film through animation
 live ection kaa upyog pikur ke liye ek sopan sabit hua, kyonki stanton apni agali pariyojna jon carter of mars banane kii yojana par kaam kar rahe the
 Storyboarder Derek Thompson noted that the introduction of live action meant that the rest of the film should look more realistic
 egalstone ne kaha ki yadi aitihaasik manushya ko anemated or thodaa-sa haasyaaspad kiya gaya to darshak samaj nahin paaenge ki unka avakraman kitna gambhir he
 Stanton named Fred Willard as the historic By n Large CEO because "I think he is a very friendly and insincere car salesman
" " siio kehete hai "ste da course", jiskaa prayog stanton kiya karte the kyonki unhen lagata ki yah haasyaaspad he
 These shots used industrial lighting and magic for visual effects
 1990 ke dashak ke dauraan WALL-E aviksit hi rah gaya, aanshik rup se isaki vajah yah rahi thi ki laxo junior yaa R2-D2 jaisaa bartaav karanevaale pramukh paatr vaali lambii feechar film ke bare main stanton or pikur puri tarah aashwast nahin the
 Stanton explained that there are two types of robots in cinema: "human beings with metallic skin" like tin humans, or "working machines" like Luxo and R2
 He found the second idea to be "powerful," because it inspires viewers to compare themselves to the characters, just as they do to infants and pets: "you're forced
" 

 aap lagbhag khud ko yah kehane se roak nahin pate hai 'oh, mujhe lagata he ki yah mere jaisaa he! lagata he ki yah bhookha he! mujhe lagata he ki yah baahar ghoomana chahta he
 "he added," We want to convince the audience that they are watching a machine that has life
 " anemetaron ne mashinari ke adhyayan ke liye punarchakran kendron kaa daura kiya, unhone robot dizinron se bhi mulaakaat kii, robot ke adhyayan ke liye ve nasa kii jet proplson prayogshaala gayi, mars rover kii ek recording dekhi, or san francisco police vibhaag se bam kaa pataa lagane vaala robot le aaye
 In their performance, spontaneity was liked, they were made to do a lot of action so that they look like human beings
 stanton chaahate the ki WALL-E ek dibbe jaisaa or EVE andey jaisi lage
 wall-e's Stanton-inspired eyes were inspired by a pair of binoculars, which Stanton realized when he was watching the Oakland Athletics game against the Boston Red Sox, because of the deviation that he "could not see the entire innings
" The director remembered Buster Keaton and decided that the robot would not have a mouth or nose
 stanton ne WALL-E ko adhik sahanubhutisheel banane ke liye ek juum lens kaa prayog kiya
 Ralph Egglestone noted that this feature would cause the animators to overwork and gave the robot a childlike nature
 punarchakran kendron ke dauron ke dauraan kachra kampactaron ke pikur ke adhyayan se uske sharir nirmaan kii prerana mili
 His tank treads were inspired by a wheelchair, which was developed by someone using treads instead of wheels
 anemetars chaahate the ki uski kohni ho, lekin unhone mahasoos kiya ki yah avastavik hoga kyonki apane sharir main sirf kachra bharne ke liye uski dizin kii jaani he
 When they waved and tested him, his hands looked very weak
 anemeshan nideshak anges maclen ne apane pita kii dizin kii hui incjet printers ke aadhaar par suzav diya ki uske sharir ke bagal se uske haathon ko trek se jod diya jaay, taaki unhen idhar-udhar ghumaya ja sake
 This hand design contributed to the creation of the character's condition, so if they wanted to make him appear nervous, they would turn him down
 stanton WALL-E or short circuit ke johny 5 ke bich samanta se tab tak bekhbar rahe, jab tak ki dusron ne unka dhyaan nahin dilaayaa
 Stanton wanted EVE to try the highest level of technology and asked ipod designer Jonathan Ivey to inspect its design
 He was very impressed
 His eyes were drawn like a light-bright toy, but Pixar did not want to make them too soulful, because it could easily make his eyes go into the heart to demonstrate love or something like that
 uski simit dizin ke kaaran anemetaron ko uske saath ek chitrakala jaisaa vyavhaar karnaa padaa, bhav vyakt karne ke liye uski shaareerik mudra par nirbhar hona padaa
 unhone use ek manaati yaa ek safed whale jaisaa paaya kyonki uskaa tairta hua sharir pani ke neeche rahane vaale praani ke sadrush laga
 Auto 2001: a Space Odyssey was a conscious tribute to the HAL 9000 and the use of the Also Sprach Zarathustra to further the skirmish between the captain and Auto further enhanced it
 The way he hangs from a wall, he feels a fear like a spider
 multah, auto kii dizin puri tarah se alag kii gayi thi, EVE jaisaa, lekin mardaana or adhikarpurn; parichaarak roboton ko bhi or adhik aakraamak gashti-boats banaaye gayi
 Most of the robots were built under the build-a-boat program, where various heads, hands and treads were mixed together in over a hundred variations
 manushyon ko unke sthool sharir ke kaaran samudri singh kii tarah banaaya gaya, saath hi shishuon ko bhi
 film nirmaataaon ne gaur kiya ki bacchon kii charbi vayaskon kii tulana main kahin adhik kadi hoti hai or unhone is sanrachana kaa film ke manushyon ke liye nakal kii
 For the animation of his robots, Pixar watched Keaton and Chaplin's films daily for nearly a year, and sometimes Harold Lloyd's films
 Later, the filmmakers learned that all emotions can be communicated silently
 stanton ne kiton ke "great stone phase" kaa drushtaant prastut kiya, taaki aparivartaneey haav-bhav ke liye paatr ko anemated karte samay unamem dridhtaa daali jaay
 inhen phir se dekhne ke baad stanton ne mahasoos kiya ki film nirmaataa- dhwani ke pradurbhaav ke baad se - vivaran sampreshit karne ke liye samvaad par bahut zyada nirbhar kar rahe hai
 The filmmakers gave the name "hall" to the cockroach of WALL-E kept as a pet, in reference to silent filmmaker Hal Roche
 He also watched the films 2001: a Space Odyssey, The Black Stallion and Never Cry Wolf, which had sound but did not rely on dialogue
 stanton ne silent running ke prabhaav ko sweekaar kiya, kyonki iske maun robot R2-D2 ke sadrishon ke agua rahe the, or "hopalace romantic" kii woodi ellen ne bhi WALL-E ko prerit kiya
 Producer Jim Morris recommended Ben Burtt as the sound designer for WALL-E, as Stanton was using R2-D2 as the criteria for robots
 bart ne apana kaam puraa kiya Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith or apni patni se kaha ki ab vah robot par bananevaali filmon ke liye kaam nahin karegaa, lekin unhone WALL-E or isaki dhvaniyon ke pratisthaapan ko "nayaa or romaanchak" bataaya
 He recorded 2500 sounds for the film, which is twice the average volume of a Star Wars film, and a record for his career
 bart ne 2005 main kaam shuru kiya, or do saal tak apni aawaaj ke nispandan ke saath prayog karte rahe
 Burt described the robot's voices as "the universal language of a childlike voice"
 "'oh', 'hamm?', 'hah', tumhen pataa he?" During production, Burt got a chance to see the material used by Jimmy Macdonald, the sound designer for many of Disney's domestic classic films
 bart ne WALL-E main mcdonald kii anek saamagree kaa upyog kiya
 Because Burt was not only adding sound effects during post-production work, but the animators were also always evaluating his new creation, which Burt found an unusual experience
 ve anemetars ke saath milakar kaam kar rahe the, dhwani jodne ke baad ve unhen anemeshan waapas karte, jisase unhen adhik kalpana karne kaa mauka miltaa
 Burt continued to choose scientifically accurate sounds for each character, but if he could not do what would work, then he would choose a dramatic sound like an unrealistic noise
 Understanding the concept of the characters' art, Burt searched for hundreds of sounds, after which he and Stanton would sort out a few for each robot
 bart ne island in da ski dekhte samay ek haath se chalaanevaala vidyut janarator dekha or WALL-E ko aasapaas ghumaane main istemaal ke liye us jaisaa, khulaa hua upkaran ibe ke 1950 se ve kharid laaye
 Burt also used an automobile self-starter for the WALL-E when it starts moving fast, and he used the sound of the car's demolition center to destroy the waste in the body of WALL-E
 
 WALL-E kii bydaree puri tarah richarge ho gayi he, ise suchit karne ke liye mashintosh computer jhankaar kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 For EVE, Burt wanted his humming to be of musical quality
 bart keval bich kii yaa mardaana aawaaj hi nikaal sakate the, so pikur karmchaaree elisa nit ko apni aawaaj dene ke liye kaha gaya taaki bart electronic badlaav laa sake
 Stanton correctly considered the sound effect good enough to give him that role
 bart ne EVE kii udaan ke liye ek das-feet lambey radio-niyantrit jet vimaan kii udaan kii recording kii, or uske plasma top ke liye, bart ne ek seedhi se nagaade kii chadi se ek chust trishanku ko hit kiya
 He described it as a "cousin" to the noise of the Star Wars blaster
 macin tok kaa istemaal kiya gaya kyonki stanton "chaahate the ki auto robot kaa pratimaan bane, bhaavana rahit, ziros and vans, matlabi or bhavashunya stephen hockins jaisi aawaaj mujhe lagata he ki bilkul sahi he
 "to make him feel mechanically, additional sound was added for the character, so that it always looked like he was thinking and calculating
 sigurni vivar ko yaan ke computer kii aawaaj dene kii bhoomika di gayi
 Stanton joked about the role of Weaver, saying, "you know you're going to be a" mother now? " Yan's computer is "mother" in the film Alien
 bart ne 1987 main niagara jalprapaat kaa daura kiya tha or is dauraan unhone hawa kii awaajon kii recording kii thi
 The scene where WALL-E escapes from a falling shopping cart, picking up a canvas bag to record a sandstorm, Burt and his daughter go to a supermarket and put a recorder in their cart 
 unhone use parking ke paas takkar maari or use pahari se neeche girane diya
 To the sound of the recent exodus, he combined the sound of surprise and the sound of handcuffs together
 nemo main safaltaapurvak ek saath kaam karne ke baad thomas newman ek baar phir WALL-E ke liye stanton se aa jude, nemo ne newman ko anemated film main sarvshereshth sangeet ke liye ani award dilaayaa
 He started writing the script in 2005, hoping that starting it earlier would give him more time to appear in the finished film
 However, Newman noted that animation relied so much on timelines that he should have started working earlier when Stanton and Reardon were writing the screenplay
 EVE kaa prakaran oktober 2007 main pehali baar krambaddh vyavasthit kiya gaya
 When she was first flying around the Earth, her episode originally used more orchestral elements and encouraged Newman to make a more feminine voice
 newman ne kaha ki ve kis tarah dhwani ke liye sangeet chaahate rahe, is par stanton ke paas anek vichaar the or ve aam taur par unka anukaran karte kyonki unhone janaa ki ek aanshik mook film ke liye swar lipi kaa kaam mushkil he
 Stanton wanted the entire vocal script to accompany the orchestra, but Newman felt the need to narrow the idea a bit, especially in the riding scenes in the Axiom and here he used electronics
 stanton mul rup se chaahate the ki antariksh ke pehle shots ke samay 1930 kaa francisi swing sangeet bajaayaa jaay, lekin unhone da tripalats of beleville dekha or unhone uski nakal karte lagate dikhnaa nahin chaha
 Then Stanton said hello, doulie! Thinking about the song "put on your Sunday Clothes", he starred as a special collaborator Barnaby Tucker in a 1980 high school production
 stanton ne paaya ki prem kii talash karte do bhole-bhaale yuva ladakon par yah geet he, jo WALL-E kii saahchary kii apni aashaa se miltaa-julata he
 Jim Reardon suggested that WALL-E get the film in the video and Stanton included "it Only Takes a Moment" and clips of the actors in hand, because they wanted to see how WALL-E loved
 Understands and tells EVE about this, also to show the continuation of the scene
 Hello, dolly! The composer Jerry Harman gave permission for the song to be used, without knowing what it was going to use; And when he saw the film, its inclusion was described as "genius"
 sanyogvash, newman ke chachaa linel ne halo, doli! ke liye kaam kiya tha
 Newman traveled to London to compose the song "down to Earth" with Peter Gabriel, one of Stanton's favorite composers
 baad main, newman ne geet rachana ko shaamil karne ke liye kuch film kii swar lipi ko phir se taiyaar kiya, so jab ise dikhaaya jaay tab wo guspaith na lage
 Lewis Armstrong's rendition of "la Vie en Rose" was used for a montage where WALL-E fails to attract eve's attention on Earth
 exiom ke chaaron ore jab donon robot naachte hai, bing crossbi ke "stardst" kaa yah upyog patakatha main nirdisht tha, lekin newman ne chaha ki is drishy kii swar lipi khud hi taiyaar kare
 ek aisa hi bada parivartan us drishy ke liye hua, jisamen EVE ko jagaane ke liye WALL-E vibhinn tareekon se prayaas karata he; multah, iske liye "rendrops keep fouling on maai head" ke vaadya sangeet sanskaran ke saath montaj ko bajaayaa janaa tha, lekin newman khud ko chunauti dena chaah rahe the or unhone is drishy ke liye ek moulik swar lipi taiyaar kii
 Stanton described the subject of the film as "life programming is defeated by irrational love"
 mujhe yah ahsaas tha ki main in do kramadeshit roboton ke jariye yah jataane kii ichha rakhata tha ki ve jivan kaa kya matlab he, ise jaanane kii koshish karen


ve kis tarah banaaye gayi hai, ise jane bina iske viruddh jaakar ve ataarkik prem main pad jate hai
 

I realized that this is a perfect metaphor for real life
 ham jane yaa anjaane jivan se bachane ke liye apni aadaton, apni dincharya or apni leekon main fanse rahete hai
 Try to avoid the disturbed part
 anya logon ke saath rishte banane se bachaa karte hai
 Avoid making contact with the person next to you
 isi kaaran ham sab apane cell phone ke saath guzaara kar sakate hai or ek-duusare ke saath len-dein nahin rakhte
 maine sochaa, 'yahi he film ke puure mudde kaa ek adarsh vistaaran
' main vigyaan ke saath is tarah chalanaa chahta tha ki yah sab taarkik rup se ubhar sake
 Stanton noted that many commentators have emphasized the environmental aspect of manners of humanity, because "that isolation is going to be a cause, indirectly, that everything that is happening in life is bad for humanity or the planet
" " stanton ne kaha ki kaam karne ke prayaas ko dur le jane ke dwaara, sambandhon ko banane ke prayaas kii maanavtaa kii zarurat ko bhi robot dur le ja rahe hai
 Christian journalist Rod Dreher saw technology as a complex villain in the film
 The artificial lifestyles of humans in the Axiom separate them from nature, "making them slaves to both technology and their basic instincts and they lose all that makes them human
" " drehar ne yaan ke saaf-suthere chikne roboton ke saath kathor parishramee, maile-kuchaile WALL-E kii tulana kii
 However, it is not the robots but the humans who made them superfluous, and in the end of gratitude, humans and robots are shown working with each other in the renewal of the Earth
 "WALL-E koi takanic virdohi film nahin he," unhone kaha
 "yah takanic kaa shaitanikaran nahin karata he

 mapevidya yaa maapvigyaan main maapan ke sabhi saidhantik or vyaavhaarik pahaluon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 It is the science of measurement and its applications
 maapvigyaan bhautikee kii vah shakha he jisamen shuddh maap ke bare main hamen gyaan hota he
 In metrology, basically we discuss about the three quantities, that is, mass, length, and time, and with the knowledge of these three quantities, we measure other quantities, such as density, volume, force, and power
 maapvigyaan dwaara aparivartaneey maanakon kaa nirdesh hi nahin miltaa, varan inhen kaayam bhi rakhaa jaataa he
 By these standards, we also measure and compare the properties of objects
 doosraa paksh yah he ki kisi kaarivishesh ko drushti main rakhkar maapvigyaan se aise tareeke praapt hote hai jinase tulanaayen kaaphi ucch str kii shuddhta tak kii ja saken
 In the modern sciences and industries, the above basic comparisons must be very pure
 maap purnataya thik nahin hoti or nishchit rup se usamen kuch na kuch praayogic galati sadaa hi rahati he
 Nowadays the following approximations of accuracy are found in the more fundamental functions of metrology: antarrashtriya adirup kilogram ke do platinum iridium namoonon kii tulana main : 10,00,00,000 main ek bhaag
 Compared to ordinary chemical weights: one part in 10,00,000
 sookshmmapi tula dwaara chote chote bhaaron kii tulana main : 10,00,00,000 main ek bhaag
 Compared to two yards or standard meters: one part per 1,00,00,000
 antya maanak kii rekhamanak se tulana main : 10,00,000 main ek bhaag
 Determination of normal volume and density: one part per 10,000
 antya maanak ke kulak ke anshankan, 1 inch kii lambaai se kam nahin main 10,00,000 main ek bhaag
 0
 xxrep 5 0 5 inches, or 0
0001 millimeters, in full length posts of calibration of marked yards or subdivisions of metal scales
 saadhaarant: prayog main aanevaale maanakon ke liye is vishay ko maap or taul sheershak lekh main dekhen
 Wavelength as a natural standard - subsequent progress has changed our beliefs to a great extent
 sarvapratham, vaigyanik micelson ke prayogon ne ek prakritik maanak, kaa tarangadairdhya, sthapit kiya, jo sarvasammati se maan liya gaya yah maanak kam se kam utani hi ucch str kii shuddhta ke saath punarutpaadaneey he jitani dravyatmak maanakon kii tulanaaon main paaya jaataa he
 But the best feature of this standard is that it is beyond the possibility of long-term variance, whereas all other types of standards are used
 prithvi ke kisi bhi bhaag main ham is prakritik maanak kii sahaayta se dravyatmak maanakon kaa satyaapan kar sakate hai
 If the fluid parameters are to be compared to the prototype meter by sending it to the international central laboratory, then there is a possibility of loss in traffic, but with the help of natural standard we can do this work in our own laboratory
 duusari baat yah he ki is prakaar ke sudhaaron se chapate sironvaale maanakon kaa vikaas hua
 Nowadays such punishments are also attainable, whose ends are completely parallel
 is prakaar ke dandon kii lambaaiyon ko rekhiy maanak se na nikaalkar sidhe prakaashiya vyatikaran se nikaala jaataa he
 Michelson's interferometer was also used to know how many light waves come in a standard meter and what is their number? Michaelsen identified the international meter at 150 centigrade heat and 760 mm 0 atmosphere pressure, which is housed at the International Institute of Measurements and Weights near Paris, in the cadmium red lines
 yah maan 15,53,163
5 he, jo 2 ́106 main ek seemaa tak sahi he
 Subsequent experiments by Fabri Para revealed that this number is 15,53,164
13 in a meter in dry air at 15 ° c and 760 millimeter pressure
 yadi micelson ke prayogen main jalawaashp ke prabhaav ke liye sanshodhan kiya jaay, to yah spasht hota he ki donon ke maan main koi antar nahin he
 There is evidence that the fluid standard yard has probably decreased by 0
0002 inches since its construction, but it has remained unchanged as far as the international prototype meter is concerned
 micelson tathaa fabri paro ke prayogon ne ise siddh bhi kar diya he
 The basis of their comparison was the red line of cadmium
 dravya ke sab sab maanak meter ek mishradhatu ke banaae jate hai, jiske nirmaan main 90% platinum tathaa 10% iridium naamak dhaatu hoti he
 In this type, meters are considered to be most satisfactory for basic standards
 bahut se kaaryon main, jahaan atyant hi yatharth maap kii samasya aa khadi hoti he, vahaan yah aavashyak he ki ham aise dravya kaa vyavhaar karen jiskaa tapiya prasar naam maatr kaa ho
 Such metals have been discovered and one of them is called 'invar'
 yah nikal tathaa ispaat kii mishradhatu he, jisamen 36% nikal rahata he
 The second alloy is labeled stable invar
 isamen thodaa chromium bhi hota he
 This alloy has a much lower spread than ordinary invar, even then it cannot be considered as a constant
 doosraa dravya sangalit silica he, jiskaa prasar gunank bahut hi kam he
 This material increases only 0
4 ́10-6 by one degree Celsius
 sangalit silica kaa maanak meter ek nalee ke aakaar kaa hota he, jiske sire par samaantar patt sanlin hote hai
 On its platinized plane, the lines are carved
 is maanak ke bare main jahaan tak gyaat he, isaki lambaai main koi parivartan nahin hua he
 Since this type of standard is very fragile, it was neither accepted as a fundamental reference standard nor was it practiced in daily work
 keval maapvigyaan prayogshaalaon main ise prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 No natural standard has yet attempted to define a unit code
 ham sabhi laagon ko yah gyaat he ki radio sakriy padaartho kii khoj main pehle sanhati yaa dravyaman padaarth kaa ek aavashyak sthir gun mana jaataa tha
 Changes in the codification or mass standard of weavers are possible only due to abrasion, oxidation and hygienic absorption
 yadi dravyon ke maanakon kaa sangrakshan tathaa upyog uchit saavdhaanee ke saath kiya jaay, to ye kaaphi had tak bhaar kii sthirataa kaa pradarshan karte hai
 The basic weighting standard is made of platinum and iridium alloys
 isi mishradhatu kaa upyog 'rajkeey maanak pound' tathaa 'antarrashtriya aadi praroop kilogram' ke nirmaan main kiya gaya he
 After several years when the various national copies of the kilogram were re-compared, it was found that the level of stability was up to one part in 108
 isse maanakon kii yatharyata hi nahin varan tulanaaon kii purnataa bhi parilakshith hoti he
 a second material, in which a high degree of stability of the cod is found, is called crystal quartz
 isamen trutiyaan ye hai ki iskaa ghanatv apekshaakrit kam he or yah aarta avasorak he
 These standards remove different volumes of air when comparing air codification standards
 at: sanhati ke maanakon kii tulana karne main upree utplavan prabhaav kaa vichaar avashya rakhana chahie
 If the density of the standard is low, the buoyancy modification will be high
 platinum-iridium maanakon kii aapasi tulana main jo shuddhta praapt hoti he, vah is satyansh par aadhrut he ki inkaa ghanatv adhik hi nahin varan bahut paas paas hota he
 Due to this the buoyancy modification is very less
 un bhaaron kii tulana main utplavan sanshodhan ek samasya ke rup main aa khadaa hota he jinke ghanatv main bahut antar hota he jinke, jaise platinum, quartz tathaa pital aadi
 It is necessary to weigh in an airless environment to remove this defect
 pratidin ke vyapaarik kaaryon main taul kaa kaary hawa main hi hota he or utplavan ke kaaran jo antar baaton tathaa maal main hota he, vah vyapaarik drushtikon se naganya he
 The inspectors employ the standard of the weights of brass, which has a density of 8
143, to compare the trade weights
 jab ham vayurahit vaataavaran main taul nahin karte hai, tab bhi dravyaman ke praathmik maanakon kii sahi tulana ke liye tula kii banaavat uttam, prayog kii reeti daksh tathaa satark honi chahie
 To keep the zero plate reading constant, it is necessary to take utmost care in temperature stability
 isaliye jis kaksh main tula rakhi ho usko taap sthaapakiy reeti se niyantrit hona aavashyak he or nireekshak ko taulne kaa kaary kaksh se baahar se karnaa chahie, yaa use kuch duuri se taulnaa chahie
 The use of weights should be done by mechanical control from outside the balance, or by driving with long rods
 tula kii tandi kaa sanchalan yaa to doordarshee se dekhnaa chahie athwa paimaane ke aar paar tandi se lage hue shishe se paravartit hote ek prakashpunj kii maapni par gati se
 The effect of heat is minimal on the bent, so it is necessary that the stem of the invar is brought into practice, but that the inwar is somewhat magnetic
 yadi atyant ucch str kii shuddhta kii aavashyaktaa ho, to yah aavashyak he ki tula kii tandi chumbakeey prabhaav se purnataya prachhann ho or tula ko ek lohe ke baks main rakhaa jaae
 Small weights are used for weighing small quantities and especially in comparison to the densities of gases, which are made of fully reinforced quartz
 is prakaar kii tulaon dwaara 108 main ek bhaag kii shuddhta tak 1 / 10 gram bhi taula ja chukaa he

 bhartiya darshan ke chah prakaaron main se sankhya bhi ek he jo prachinkaal main atyant lokapriy tathaa prathit hua tha
 It is a philosophy with absolutely opposite beliefs from Advaita Vedanta
 isaki sthapana karne vaale mul vyakti kapil kahe jate hai
 The literal meaning of 'sankhya' is 'numerical' or analysis
 isaki sabase pramukh dharna sristi ke prakruti-purush se bani hone kii he, yahan prakruti jad he or purush chetan
 The principles of shiva-shakti of the Shaktas, the energy sources of the Yoga scriptures, are seen in parallel
 bhartiya samskruti main kisi samay sankhya darshan kaa atyant unchaa sthaan tha
 The lofty minds of the country used to think through the method of Samkhya

 In fact, in the Mahabharata, the background of philosophical thought has an important place in numerology

 The influence of Sankhya philosophy is sufficiently existing on the philosophical background propounded in the Gita

 The great quality of this nature-cause-debate of Sankhyacharyas is that the solution of the asymmetry of the world on the basis of the satta, rajas and tamas elements of different religions seems very wise
 kisi loukik samasya ko ishwar kaa niyam na maanakar in prakrutiyon ke talmail bigadane or jeevon ke purusharth na karne ko kaaran bataaya gaya he
 That is, the greatest greatness of Sankhya philosophy is that the origin of creation in it is not considered by God but it has been understood as a developmental process and it is believed that the creation after passing through many stages, in its present form Has been received
 kapilacharya ko kai anishvaravaadi maanate hai par bhagavadagita or satyarthprakash jaise granthon main is dharna kaa nishedh kiya gaya he
 The mainstay of Sankhya philosophy is hospitality
 is siddhanth ke anusaar, bina kaaran ke kaary kii utpatti nahin ho sakati
 As a result, this world has its origin from zero, not from any fundamental entity
 yah siddhanth baudhon ke shoonyavad ke vipareet he
 Work remains in the full cause of its origin
 kaary apane kaaran kaa saar he
 Work and reason are express and latent forms of virtually the same process
 satkaryawad ke do bhed hai- parinamwad tathaa vivartvaad
 Consequentialism implies that reason is transformed into action in real form
 jaise til tel main, doodh dahi main roopantarit hota he

 jaise-rassi main sarp kaa abhas hona
 Sankhya philosophy was very popular and famous in ancient times
 bhartiya samskruti main kisi samay sankhya darshan kaa atyant unchaa sthaan tha
 The lofty minds of the country used to think through the method of Samkhya
 mahabharatakaar ne yahan tak kaha he ki gyaanan c loke yadihasti kinchit sankhyagatan tachch mahanmahatman 
 In fact, in the Mahabharata, the background of philosophical thought has an important place in numerology
 shanti parv ke kai sthalon par sankhya darshan ke vichaaron kaa bade kavyamay or rochak dhang se ullekh kiya gaya he
 The influence of Sankhya philosophy is sufficiently existing on the philosophical background propounded in the Gita
 vastut: sankhya darshan kisi samay atyant lokapriy ho gaya tha
 Whatever may be the reasons for its popularity, but one must have seemed that this philosophy has resolved the contrast seen in life in a beautiful manner by reposing the trinitarian nature as omnipresent
 sankhyacharyon ke is prakruti-kaaran-vaad kaa mahaan gun yah he ki pruthak-pruthak dharm vaale satvon, rajas tathaa tamas tatwon ke aadhaar par jagat ke vaishamy kaa kiya gaya samaadhaan bada nyaayayukt tathaa buddhigamya prathit hota he
 The word "samkhya" is derived by adding the atomic suffix to the word "number" and the etymology of the word number is samachaksham dhatiya khyan darshanya suffix top, according to which it means Samyakti Khyati, Sadhu Darshan or True Knowledge
 sankhyacharyon kii yah samyak khyaati, unka yah satya gyaan vyaktavyakt rup dwividh achit tatv se purush rup chit tatv ko pruthak jaan lene main nihit he
 The man remains virtually untouched even if he appears to be stained in the prapancha from the top
 usamen aasakt yaa lipt dikhaai padane par bhi vastut: anasakt yaa nirlypt rahata he--sankhyacharyon kii yah sabase badi darshanik khoj unheen ke shabdon main satvapurushanyatakhyati, vivek khyaati, vyaktavyaktjvvigyaan, aadi naamon se vyavahrut hoti he
 With this wisdom, people believe in accomplishing the ultimate effort or goal of human life
 is prakaar "sankhya", shabd sankhyacharyon kii sabase badi darshanik khoj kaa vaastavik swaroop prakat karne vaala sankshipt naam he jiske sarvapratham vyaakhyaata hone ke kaaran unki vichaardhaara atyant pracheen kaal main "sankhya" naam se abhihit hui
 The term "samkhya" is also considered to be a fallacy from the word "number"
 mahabharat main sankhya ke vishay main aae hue ek shloke main ye donon hi prakaar ke bhav prakat kiye gaye hai
 It is as follows - Number Prakurvate Chave Prakriti Prakrakshate
 tattwani c chatuvinshad ten sankhya: prakirtita:
 The meaning of this is that the number which preaches the wisdom of nature and man, which imparts the effect of nature and the number which determines the number twenty-four of the elements, are called Sankhya
 kuch logon kii aisi dharna he ki gnanarthak "sankhya" shabd se kii jane vaali gaun sankhya main prakruti evam purush ke vivek gyaan se hi jivan ke param lakshya kaivalya yaa moksh kii siddhi maani gai he, at: us gyaan kii prapti hi mukhya he or is kaaran se usee par sankhya kaa sara bal he
 Sankhya assumes twenty-four elements, it is just a statement of a common fact, hence secondary
 udaiveer shastri ne apane "sankhya darshan kaa itihaas" naamak granth main sankhya shaastra ke kapil dwaara pranit hone main bhagwat 3-25-1 par shridhar swami kii vyakhya ko uddhrut karte hue is prakaar likhaa he- antim shloke kii vyakhya karte hue vyakhyaakaar ne spasht likhaa he- tatwanaa sankhyata ganak: sankhya-pravartak ityarth:
 This makes it certain that this Kapil is the innovator or prophet of Sankhya
 shridhar swami ke ganak: shabd par shastri ji ne neeche die gaye footnot main is prakaar likhaa he- madhya kaal ke kuch vyakhyakaaron ne "sankhya" pad main "sankhya" shabd ko gananaaparak samajhakar is prakaar ke vyaakhyaan kiye hai
 In fact, it means elemental knowledge
 parantu gaharaai se vichaar karne par yah baat utani saamaanya yaa gaun nahin he jitani apatat: prathit hoti he
 It seems that in very early times when the number of elements could not be fixed in the initial stage of philosophical development, then Sankhya first tried the subtle metaphysics of this visible physical world, which in turn resulted in the number of elements present in its origin
 : Was determined twenty four
 inamen bhi pratham tatv jise unhone "prakruti" yaa "pradhan" naam diya, shesh taees kaa mul siddh kiya gaya
 This same element "nature" was considered to be the result of the Chish Purush, resulting in twenty-three different elements respectively and generating the entire root world
 is prakaar tatv sankhya ke nirdhaaran ke peeche sankhyon kii bahut badi bauddhik sadhana chhipi hui prathit hoti he
 After all, how would it have been possible to determine the number of elements through micro-intelligence without thinking and analyzing for a long time? uparyukt vivechan se aisa nishchay hota he ki sankhya darshan kaa "sankhya" naam donon hi prakaaron se uske buddhivaadee tarkpradhan hone kaa suchak he
 Even considering the basic nature of the figures and the Chit Purush both of the basic elements as proven by the Agama or Shruti proof, it is also evident to prove it mainly on the basis of conjecture proof
 aaj kal uplabdh sankhya pravachan sutara evam sankhyakarik, in donon hi moulik sankhya granthon ko dekhne se spasht gyaat hota he ki inamen sankhya ke donon hi moulik tatwon- prakruti evam purush kii satta hetuon ke aadhaar par anumaan dwaara hi siddh kii gai he
 Tips are also given in the man's plurality
 satkaryawad kii sthapana bhi tarkon ke hi aadhaar par kii gai he
 
 is prakaar sankhya shaastra kaa shravan, jo vivek gyaan kaa muladhar he, tark pradhan he
 Contemplation is the contemplation of facts and principles scripted by long-term arguments
 is prakaar jis sankhya yaa vivek gyaan ke kaaran sankhya darshan kaa "sankhya" naam padaa, uskaa vishesh sambandh tark or buddhivaadita se he
 Due to this rationalism, some theories of Sankhya philosophy developed very independently from the Vedic sect in the later period, due to which the Acharyas like Badarayana Vyasa and Shankaracharya refuted it and even said it to the vedic sect
 yah sampradaay apane mul main to avaidic nahin prathit hota or apane parvarti rup main bhi sarvatha avaidic nahin he
 The famous commentator Vigyanbhukta has also considered Sankhya to be the contemplation of Agama or Shruti by the arguments of Satta
 unhone apane sankhya pravachan-sutara-bhashya kii avataranika main yahi baat is prakaar kahi he- jo "akodwitiya:" ityadi purush vishyak veda vachan jeev kaa sara abhiyaan dur karke use mukt karaane ke liye us purush ko sarv prakaar ke vaishamry- rupabhed se rahit bataate hai unheen veda vachanon ke arth ke manan ke liye apekshit sad yuktiyon kaa upadesh karne ke liye sankhyakarta narayanavatar bhagwaan kapil aavirbhoot hue the
 Science is clear from the monk's earlier discourses that he considers Sankhya Shastra as Vedanusari
 unka spasht mat he ki "akodwitiyah" ityadi veda vachanon ke arth kaa hi vah sad yuktiyon evam tarkon dwaara samarthan karata he, uskaa pratipaadan or vivechan karke use bodhgamy banaata he
 Vigyanbhuk has actually expressed his aforesaid opinion by following the earlier tradition prevalent in folk
 atyant pracheen kaal se hi mahabharat, gita, ramayana, smritiyon tathaa puraanon main sarvatra sankhya kaa na keval ucch gyaan ke rup main ullekh bhar hua he, apitu uske siddhanton kaa yatra-tatra vistrut vivaran bhi hua he
 In the Gita too, the trinitarian principle of Sankhya philosophy has been adopted very beautifully
 "trigunatmika prakruti nity parinamini he
 His three qualities always produce some or the other result, man is a non-believer "- this principle of Samkhya has become an essential part of Gita's Nishkam Karmayoga
 isi prakaar anyatra bhi sankhya darshan ke anek siddhant anya darshanon ke siddhanton ke poorak rup se pracheen sanskrit vadmay main drushtigochar hote hai
 From all these things, it seems that this philosophy has been Vedic in its origin, not impersonal, because if the truth were contrary to this, Vedaprana would not have given the above mentioned area for so much propagation of Samkhya in this country
 is anishvarwad, prakruti purush dwaitvaad, parinamwad aadi tathakthith veda viruddh siddhanton ke kaaran vedabaahya kahkar iskaa khandan karne vaale vedant bhashyakaar shankaracharya ko bhi brahmasutra 2
1
3 ke bhashya main likhnaa hi padaa ki "aadhyaatmavishyak anek smritiyon ke hone par bhi sankhya yoga smritiyon ke hi niraakaran main praytn kiya gaya
 Because both of them are famous as the means of ultimate effort in the world, are acclaimed by the saintly great men and consist of "linga", "tatkaranam Sankhya Yogabhishannam Gyatva Deva and Muchyatee Sarvapashai: Ya, etc
 " swayan bhashyakaar ke apane sakshya se bhi spasht he ki unke purvavarti sutarakaar ke samay main bhi anek shisht purush sankhya darshan ko vaidic darshan maanate the tathaa param purusharth kaa saadhan maanakar uskaa anusaran karte the
 Based on all these facts, it is expedient to consider Sankhya philosophy as Vedic
 haan, apane parvarti vikaas main yah avashya hi kuch moolbhoot siddhanton main veda viruddh ho gaya he jaise uttarvarti sankhya vaidic parampara ke viruddh nirishwar he, uski prakruti swatantra rup se swat: samast vishwa kii sristi karti he
 But the origin of this philosophy is found in the oldest Chandogya and Vrhadaranyaka Upanishads
 isi se isaki pracheenta suspasht he
 Only two fundamental texts of this philosophy are available today - the first "samkhya-discourse-sutra" with six chapters and the second "samkhikarika" with seventy kariks
 in do ke atirikt ek atyant laghukaay sutaragranth bhi he jo "tatv samaas" ke naam se prasiddh he
 The rest of the Samkhya Vadmaya is only the commentary and epitope of these three
 inamen sankhya sutron ke upadeshta parampara se kapil muni maane jate hai
 Scholars do not consider the Sankhya-discourse-sutras available for many reasons to be Kapilized
 itani baat avashya hi nishchit he ki in sutron ko kapilopdisht maanane par bhi iske anek sthalon ko swayan sutron ke hi ant:-sakshya ke bal par prakshipt maananaa padegaa
 The numerals are composed by Ishvakrishna, whose time is considered by the majority to be the middle of the third century AD
 vastut: inkaa samay isse paryaapt purv kaa prathit hota he
 There is no scripture of Kapuri's disciple, Asuri, but his famous disciple Acharya Panchshikh, in the form of many sutras quoted in ancient texts like Vyasarit Yogabhasya, etc
, it seems clear that any sutra script by him was famous in ancient times
 anek vidwaanon ke mat se yah prasiddh granth shashthitantr hi tha
 By the opinion of Udayveer Shastri, the conspiracy-related Sankhya-discourse-sutra available in the present times was also known as "shashtitantra" due to the representation of shasthi substances
 unke mat se sambhavat: kapil muni ke prashishy panchashikhacharya ne us par vyakhya likhi thi or vah bhi mulgranth ke hi naam par shashthitantr kahi jaati thi
 According to the opinion of some scholars, "shashthi Tantra" is written of the famous numerical annuity
 jaigishadhya, deval, asit ityadi anya anek pracheen sankhyacharyon ke vishay main aaj kuch vishesh gyaan nahin he
 The outer part of the Sun's spectrum is called Kirit or Corona
 purna suryagrahan ke samay vah shwet varna kaa hota he or shwet daalia ke pushp ke sadrush sundar lagata he
 Kirit is a very wide region and its height above the photosphere is several times the diameter of the Sun
 corona chaand yaa pani kii boondon ke vivartan ke dwaara surya ke chaaron ore banaai gai ek pastil helo ko kehete hai
 It is made by plasma
 aise sirostertus ke rup main badalon main buundon or badal parat swayan ko lagbhag puri tarah se samaan is ghatana ke liye aadesh main ho rahaa hoga
 rang pradarshan kabhi kabhi ke liye aanandadaayak prathit hota he
 The temperature of the corona is millions of degrees
 prithvi se corona sirf purna suryagrahan ke dauraan hi dikhaai detaa he
 The corona is the sun's largest layer
 corona kaa teevr taapmaana abhi tak gyaat nahin ho paaya he
 The solar wind exits the Sun at a speed of about 400 to 700 km per second
 doordarshee kii sahaayta se uskaa vaastavik vistaar gyaat nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki jyon-jyon surya se dur jaaen prakaash kii tivrata shighrata se kam hoti jaati he
 Therefore, after a certain height on the photograph board, the light of the kit cannot be depicted
 radio doordarshee kirit ke vistaar kaa adhik yatharthata se nirdhaaran karne main upyukt siddh hua he
 According to its inspection, the Kirit can be more than ten times the height of the Sun above the photosphere
 kirit ke bahya bhaag radio tarang kirit tak bhejkar paravartit tarang kaa adhyayan kiya jaae
 Hence the utility of radio telescopes is also limited
 ril ne kirit ke adhyayan ko ek vicitra vidhi nikaali he
 Every year in the month of June, one star of the Taurus planetarium comes near Kirit
 jyon-jyon prithvi kii vaarshik gati ke kaaran surya shanai:-shanai: is taare ke sammukh hokar gaman karata he, taare se aanevaali radio tarang kii tivrata kaa satat maapan kiya jaataa he
 This intensity starts to decrease even before the stars reach the visible range of the kirits
 yah dekha gaya he ki vastav main radio tarang kii tivrata main surya ke ardhavyas kii 20 guni duuri par se hi kshinta aane lag jaati he
 Not only this, sometimes the ferocious substance reaches millions of kilometers away and sometimes it reaches the earth and produces a horrific magnetic disturbance and radiant pole pole
 kirit kii seemaa achal nahin apitu suryakalank ke saath parivartit hoti rahati he
 At the maximum stigma, they are almost circular
 It is spread irregularly around it and at the minimum stigma, it becomes more broad in the equatorial plane of the sun
 isse yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki kirit kii akruti surya ke chumbakeey kshetra par nirbhar he
 Continuous radiation is marked in the coronal spectrum, in which some radiant lines are located
 anek varshon tak in rekhaon kaa kaaran gyaat nahin kiya ja sakaa, kyonki unke tarangadairdhya kisi bhi gyaat tatv kii varnakram rekhaon ke tarang-dairghy ke sadrush nahin the
 Hence, the Jyotishis imagined that a new element called 'coronium' is present in Suryakirit
 parantu shanai:-shanai: naveen tatwon kii aavart sarini ke rikt sthaan purna kiye jane lage or yah nishchaypurvak siddh ho gaya he ki coronium koi naveen tatv nahin he, varan koi gyaat tatv hi he jisaki rekhaon ke tarangadaidhyon main kirit kii prastut bhautik avasthaa itnaa parivartan kar detii he ki unka pahchaanana saral nahin
 In 1940, Adlen resolved this question completely
 saidhantik gananaa ke aadhaar par unhone yah siddh kar diya ki kirit ke varnakram kii pramukh rekhaon main se anek rekhaayen loh, nikal or calosium ke atyant ynit parmaanon dwaara utpann hoti hai
 For example, the neutral atom of iron contains 26 electrons and radiates atoms of the green line in the spectrum of Kirit, whose 13 electrons have been ionized
 kirit ke varnakram main upasthit rekhaon kii tivrata main kalankachakr ke saath parivartan hota rahata hai or adhiktam kalank par ve sabase adhik teevr hoti hai
 Similarly, if the intensity of the radiated lines is compared with the various segments of the Sun, then it can be said with certainty that all the lines are the most fierce near the stigmas
 roberts ne suryabimb ke poorviy or pashchimi koron par kirit kii dipti kaa dainik adhyayan kiya, jiske aadhaar par unhone yah siddh kiya ki kirit kii akruti bahut kuch sthaayee he or uske aksheeya ghurnan kaa aavartankaal 26 din he, jo prakashmandal ke ghurnan ke aavartankaal ke lagbhag he
 They were also able to prove that the radiant sections of the crown are centralized over the stigmas
 kalank or kirit ke deeptiman pradeshon kaa yah sambandh mahatvapurn he
 The presence of iron atoms in the kirite, which have 13 electrons ionized, indicates that the heat must be greater than 1 million degrees in the kirite
 is kathan kaa samarthan anek prakaar ke avlokan karte hai, jinamein se surya se aanevaale radio vikiran kii tivrata kaa adhyayan pramukh he
 Kirit, solar flame and the atmosphere being at a higher temperature than the lighthouse present a very odd situation
 yah adhik taap prakashmandal se tapasanvaahan ke kaaran nahin ho saktaa, kyonki ushma ucch taap se nimna taap kii ore gaman karti hai
 The cause of this extreme temperature of Kirit has not yet been conclusively known
 anek jyotishiyon ne samay samay par is vishay par anek prakaar ke vichaar prakat kiye hai, jinamein se mukhya nimnlikhit hai
 Menzle imagined that due to some difference in the Sun, vortices are formed in which the substance of the lower levels of the higher temperature of the Sun reaches its surface and to prevent the loss of heat arising due to expansion at every moment
 The whirlpool material keeps reheating
 yah padaarth vaatimandal main upar uthta rahata he or kuch samay ke pashchaat vah apni ushnata ko kirit main milakar uskaa taap bada detaa hai
 Unsold has proven that in a level near the lighthouse whose temperature ranges from 10,000 degrees to 20,000 degrees, the speed of matter is disturbed and this area of convection arises due to the ionization of hydrogen
 adhikansh jyotirvid is mat se sahamat hai ki yah pradesh shookikaaon evam kanikaon se sambandhit vikshubdh gati kaa udgam he
 According to Tomas and Hautgast, currents of hot gas from inside the Sun enter the Kirit with a velocity greater than the speed of sound and heat it to the observed temperature
 shwarschild ne bhi isi prakaar ke vichaar prakat kiye hai, parantu unka mat he ki ushn gas kii in dhaaraon kaa veg dhwani kii gati se kam hota hai
 It is not impossible that such effects have a very important part in determining the symptoms of kyrit
 olgaven ne yah siddh kiya he ki jab vidyuchhanchari padaarth chumbakeey kshetra main gatiman hota he to vidyucchumbakeey tarangen utpann hoti hai
 The motion of matter existing in the magnetic field of the Sun and stigmas is capable of generating such waves
 olgaven or walen kaa mat he ki jyon-jyon ye tarangen kirit main aage badhati hai unki urja k hraas hota jaataa he or yah urja kirit ko abhisht taap tak tapt karne main samarth hoti hai
 Now-a-days these ideas are being tested in detail and it is anticipated that this type of process may have a hand in the temperature of Kirit
 parantu samprati nishchayatmak rup se yah kahana ki drav-chumbakeey tarangen kirit ko abhisht taap tak tapt kar sakati hai athwa nahin, asambhav he
 Thus, excessive temperature of Kirit is still a mystery
 burushaski ek bhashaa he jo paak-adhikrut kashmir ke gilgit-blatistan kshetra ke uttari bhaagon main burusho samudaay dwaara boli jaati he
 It is a language interlocutor, that is, has no known ethnic affiliation with any other language in the world and is the only known language of its language family

 Hindi has two genders: feminine and masculine
 sanskrit main teen hote hai: streeling, pulling or napunsakaling
 There are four genders in Burushaski from which the form of nouns is changed: ling ke aadhaar par sangyaaon ko bahuvachan banane ke liye unke ant main alag-alag pratyay jode jate hai: for example: sanskrit kii tarah burushaski main bhi sangyaaon main kaarak rup dekhe ja sakate hai: In Burushaski, body parts and related people cannot be addressed without telling their relationship with their speakers
 yani keval "maan" ke liye koi shabd nahin he, balki "meri maan", "teri / tumhaari / aapaki maan" yaa "uski / unki maan" kahana padataa he, jisamen pehle upsarg or phir maan ke liye mul jad he jode jate hai: Burushaski is a dynastic language, meaning numbers are organized in groups of twenty and the word for forty is equivalent to "two-twenty"
