 The term design or design is used in applied arts, engineering, architecture and other similar creative works and fields
 ise kriya ke rup main evam sangya ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Design as a verb refers to the process that is adopted to bring or develop a product, structure, system or goods
 sangya ke rup main dizin shabd do arthon main prayukt hota he- Nowadays processes are also considered to be the result of design
 is arth main prakriya kii dizin kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Many goals are set under the design
 inamen pramukh aavashyaktaayen hai - kaary sambandhi, aakaar va aaytan sambandhi, mulya yaa laagat sambandhi, shakti kii aavashyaktaa sambandhi, rakrakhaav tathaa bigadne par sudhaar sambandhi, vibhinn bhaagon ko aapas main jodne main aasaani sambandhi, nirmaan evam utpaan main saralata aadi
 Design For the achievement of a predetermined goal, it is the 'design' to systematically organize the ideas and all the other related items
 vaastuvid kisi bhawan ke nirmaan kii yojana banaate hue rekhaon kaa vibhinn roopon main ankan kisi ek lakshya kii purti ko sochakar karata he
 The artist also tries to present a special effect or idea in the picture by combining lines
 isi prakaar imarti ejeeniyar kisi imaarat main sunishchit tikaaupan or dridhtaa laane ke liye uski vividh maapon ko niyat karata he
 All things are under design
 vaastuvid kaa kartavya he ki vah aisa vyavhaarya abhiklpana prastut kare jo bhavannirmaan kii lakshyapurti main suvidhajanak evam mitavyayi ho
 At the same time, he should also keep in mind that the size of the building should be compatible with the neighborhood of that area and can also match with the old buildings standing around Eid
 maan lijie, id-gird ke sabhi makaan mehrabadar daravajevaale hai, to unke bich ek sapaat daat ke daron kaa, sade dhang ke samnevaala makaan shobhaa nahin degaa
 Similarly, there are many other things which should be considered keeping in view the lateral environment
 duusari vishesh baat jo vaastuvid ke liye vichaarneey he, vah he bhawan ke bahari aakaar ke vishay main ek sthir mat kaa nirnay
 It should be such that even a person walking on the road should understand the building without asking what it is built for
 jaise, ek kalege ko aspataal sareekha nahin laganaa chahie or na hi aspataal kii akruti kalege sareekhee honi chahie
 The bunk building should look sturdy and safe and the exterior of the playhouse or cinema hall should be adorable
 vaastuvid ko yah sunishchit hona chahie ki usne us puure kshetra kaa bharpoor upyog kiya he jisapar use bhawan nirmit karnaa he
 Artistic designs also include painting of curtains for entertainment or theater, various types of paintings for decoration, making graffiti to express a particular idea
 kalakaar kii khubi isi main he ki vah apni abhiklpana ko yatharth aakaar de
 The painting should symbolize the living expression of the artist's thoughts
 chitra kii aavashyaktaa ke anusaar kalakaar pencil ke rekhachitr, tailchitr, pani ke rangon ke chitra aadi banaae
 The engineer of the buildings has to make his design according to the design of the architect so that the building is strong enough to handle all the loads falling on it
 is drushti se vah nirmaan ke liye vishisht upkarnon kaa chunaav karata he or aise nirmaan padaarth lagane kaa aadesh detaa he jisase imaarat sasti tathaa tikaoo ban sake
 For this, it is also necessary to keep in mind whether the specific materials recommended for manufacture are available in the market, or whether there is a lack of the desired efficiency to implement the suggested specific work styles

 Some of these weights can be calculated finely, but there are many that can only be estimated based on past experiences
 jaise bukamp ke bal ko len---iskaa anumaan bada kathin he or is baat kii koi purvakalpana nahin ho sakati ki bukamp kitne bal kaa or kahan par hoga
 However, luckily, the effect of most moving and fixed weights can be calculated quite accurately

 The forces due to wind and earthquake are ultimately uncertain, but there is usually no loss due to a slight error in their estimation of the quantity

 These facts are placed under the 'safety factor', which is assumed to be 2 to 1 / 2 for steel and 3 to 4 for concrete, timber and other equipment
 surakshagunak ko bhawan par atirikt bhaar ladane kaa bahaanaa nahin bananaa chahie
 This is only for unknown reasons and even to a lesser extent, which can prove to be helpful in the future to bear the brunt of the building, disrepair and weather uncertainties

 This rebellion lasted for two years in different regions of India

 The end of the revolt coincided with the end of the East India Company's rule in India and the British Crown's direct rule over the whole of India began for the next 90 years

 yah puri tarah se galat bhi nahin tha, kuch company adhikari dharm parivartan ke kaary main jute the
 However the company never approved the conversion
 company is baat se avgat thi ki dharm, parmparik bhartiya samaaj main vidroh kaa ek kaaran ban saktaa he
 Earlier, one of the reasons for the decline of the Portuguese from India and Japan in the sixteenth century was that they had tried to force Christianity on the masses

 The British outlawed many of the customs of Hindus and Muslims at that time which were considered antisocial by the British

 It is worth noting here that the Sikhs had stopped this long ago and the famous social reformer of Bengal, King Rammohan Roy was campaigning in favor of discontinuing the practice

 san 1853 main britain ke pradhanmantri lord abradin ne prashasnic seva ko bharatiyon ke liye khol diya parantu kuch prabud bharatiyon ke hisaab se yah sudhaar paryaapt nahin tha
 The officers of the company were empowered with a number of appeals against Indians in courts
 company bharatiyon par baari kar bhi lagaati thi jise na chukaane kii sthiti main unki sampatti adhigrahit kar lee jaati thi
 Modernization efforts of the company were viewed with suspicion in traditional Indian society
 logo ne mana ki railway jo bambai se sarvapratham chalaa ek daanav he or logo par vipatti laayegaa
 But many historians also believe that these reforms have been exaggerated because the company did not have the means to implement these reforms and their influence away from Calcutta was negligible
 1857 ke vidroh kaa ek pramukh kaaran company dwaara bharatiyon kaa aarthik shoshan bhi tha
 The policies of the company completely ended India's traditional economy
 in nitiyon ke kaaran bahut se kisaan, karigar, shramik or kalakaar kangaal ho gayi
 Along with them the situation of the landlords and big farmers also got worse
 san 1813 main company ne ek tarafa mukt vyapaar kii niti apana lee iske antargat britani vyapaariyon ko aayaat karne kii puri chhot mil gayi, paramparaagat takanic se bani hui bhartiya vasteen iske saamne tik nahin saki or bhartiya shahari hastshilp vyapaar ko acolpaneey kshati hui
 With the arrival of the railway service, small enterprises in the rural areas were also destroyed
 rail seva ne britani vyapaariyon ko dur daraaj ke gaavon tak pahunch de di
 The textile industry suffered the most
 iske saath loha vyapaar, bartan, kaanch, kaagaj, dhaatu, bandook, jahaaj or rangareji ke udyogon ko bhi bahut kshati hui
 In the 18th and 19th centuries, Indian exports came to an end due to import tax and many barriers in Britain and Europe
 parmparik udyogon ke nasht hone or saath saath aadhunik udyogon kaa vikaas na hone kii kaaran yah sthiti or bhi visham ho gayi
 The general public has no means other than farming
 kheti karne vaale kisaano kii haalat bhi kharaab thi
 In the beginning of British rule, the peasants were left at the mercy of the zamindars, who greatly increased the rent and started exploiting the peasants by forced labor and other methods
 company ne kheti ke sudhaar par bahut kam kharch kiya or adhiktar lagaan company ke kharchon ko puraa karne main prayog hota tha
 In the event of crop failure, the moneylenders loaned the farmers more interest and cheated the illiterate farmers in many ways
 britani kanoon vyavastha ke antargat bhoomi hastantaran vaid ho jane ke kaaran kisaanon ko apni bhoomi se bhi haath dhonaa padataa tha
 Due to these problems there was dissatisfaction among every section of the society
 san 1848 or 1856 ke bich lard dalhoji ne doctrin ouf laps ke kanoon ke antargat anek rajyon par adhikaar kar liya
 According to this theory, a state, territory or area of british influence will become subject to the company, if the king of the region dies without permission or the ruler is disqualified in the eyes of the company
 is siddhant par kaary karte hue lard dalhoji or uske uttaradhikari lard cannig ne satara,nagpur,jhansi,avadh ko company ke shashan main mila liya
 Political credibility of the company was also questioned due to the treaties and promises made by the company

 The soldiers were originally soldiers of Indian origin who worked in the company's Bengal Army

 This army had more soldiers than the British army
 san 1857 main is sena main 2,57,000 sipaahi the

 parantu bengal presidensi kii sena main bhartee hone vaale sainik mukhyat: avadh or ganga ke maidani ilaako ke bhoomihaar brahman or rajput the
 In the early years of the company, caste privileges and customs were given importance in the Bengal Army, but after 1840, after the coming of modern government in Calcutta, there was a fear of losing the caste among the soldiers
 sena main sipaahiyon ko jati or dharm se sambandhit chinh pahanane se manaa kar diya gaya
 In 1856, under an order, all newly recruited soldiers were made mandatory to work abroad for some time

577 calibar kii bandook thi tathaa puraani or kai dashakon se upyog main laayi ja rahi brown bas ke mukaable main shaktishaalee or achook thi
 The modern system of firing in the new gun was used, but the process of firing in the gun was old
 nayi enfield bandook bharne ke liye kaartoos ko daanton se kaat kar kholana padataa tha or usame bhare hue barud ko bandook kii nalee main bhar kar kaartoos ko daalana padataa tha
 The outer shell of the cartridge contained grease which protected it from water sealing
 sipaahiyon ke bich afawaah fail chuki thi ki kaartoos main lagi hui charbi suar or gaay ke maance se banaayi jaati he
 This was against the religious sentiments of both Hindu and Muslim soldiers
 British officials called it a rumor and suggested that soldiers make new cartridges in which goat or bee fat should be used
 is suzav ne sipaahiyon ke bich faili is afawaah ko or pukhta kar diya
 Another suggestion was that the soldier open the cartridge with his hands instead of cutting through the teeth
 parantu sipaahiyon ne ise ye kehete hue asvikaar kar diya ki ve kabhi bhi nayi kavayad ko bhul sakate hai or daanton se kaartoos ko kaat sakate hai
 The then British Army Chief George Enson, bypassing the advice of his officers, solved the problem arising out of this exercise and new gun

 The General ordered Jamadar Ishwari Prasad to arrest Mangal Pandey but the Zamidar refused

 Mangal Pandey told his comrades to openly rebel but when no one believed, he tried to take his life with his gun

 Mangal Pandey was court martialed on 6 April 1857 and hanged on 8 April

 Artificial intelligence means artificial intelligence developed in an artificial way

 kritrim budhimatta kaa uddeshy hota he ki sanganak apane-aap tay kar paye uski agali gatividhi kya hogi
 For this, the computer is programmed to select its response according to different circumstances
 iske peeche yahi prayaas hota he ki sanganak maanav kii sochane kii prakriya kii nakal kar paye
 a unique example of this is chess
] ye sanganak program maanav mastishk kii lagbhag har chaal kii kaat or apni agali chaal sochane ke liye sanganak ko program kiya hua he

 2
 intelligence - is taatpary he ki sochane, samajhane evam seekhney kii yogyata he

 1- Thinking like a human 2- Behaving like a human 3- Reasoning and thinking means sensitive, intelligent, understanding the facts and also giving feedback on logic and ideas
 is tarah ham kah sakate he kritrim tarah se ek aisa system viksit karnaa jo insaan kii tarah kaary kar sake, soch sake evam apni pratikriya de sake he

 With the progress of science, everything is becoming artificial

 Aircraft on auto pilot mode are operated by the machine
 computaron main dhvaniyaan or awaajon ko pahchaanane kii kshamta hoti he
 But artificial intelligence is also limited in one form, because its power depends on its programming

 Artificial intelligence has greatly facilitated human work

 Whereas after Ishani's father's death, her family becomes poor and she works at one place
 ranvir ishani kaa purana ghar or abhi jis jagah vah kaary karti he vah company kharid letaa he
 Chirag still wants to flee with Ishani after she wins the episode

 On the same day, Ranveer is getting married to his friend Ritika
 lekin reetika ko lagata he ki ranvir ishani ke saath hi shaadi kar ke khush rah saktaa he
 She sends Ishani to her place
 un donon kii shaadi ho jaati he
 Ishani continues to hate Ranveer but also takes care of his family
 chiraag ishani ko ranvir ke khilaaf bhadakaata he
 But when he later learns that Ranveer is innocent, Chirag tries to rape Ishani
 lekin ishani vahaan se bhaag jaati he
 She realizes that she is in love with Ranveer
 chiraag ranvir ko ishani or apni kuch nakli chhavi bhej detaa he
 Seeing this, Ranveer is left with only anger against Ishani
 jabaki ishani ab ranvir se pyaar karne lagati he
 Ranveer, who still loves Ishani, does not believe it and expresses his love
 lekin ishani ke amba or ba un donon ko alag hone ke liye kehete hai
 At her time, Ishani's brother gets married to Ritika
 isi bich chiraag kii hatya ho jaati he
 Ishani feels that this murder is done by Ranveer
 jabaki vah begunaah hota he
 Sharaman refuses to marry Ritika
 kyonki vah pehle se hi kisi or ke bachche kii maan banane vaali hoti he
 Sharman feels that the father of this child is not he but Ranveer
 ranvir or reetika ek saath rahete hai, unke mitra shikhar mehta, ishani kaa prakaran ladata he or jeet jaataa he

 phalguni, mehta ke chat se kud kar mar jaati he
 Ranveer feels that this murder is done by Nirupa
 shikhar is baat ko jaanane kii koshish karata he or vah nirupa kii jasusi karata he
 Then he comes to know that Nirupa is a northerner
 ranvir ishani ko dekh kar khush ho jaataa he
 But Ishani feels that Ranveer has married Ritika
 vah bhi shikhar se shaadi karne ke liye maan jaati he
 Only then does everyone come to know that Ranveer and Ritika are not married
 ranvir apni or reetika kii shaadi bhi usee din rakhata he jab ishani or shikhar kii hoti he
 Ishaani reopens the episode of her mother's murder
 koi ishani kii hatya karne kii koshish karata he
