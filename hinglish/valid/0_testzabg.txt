 However, the authors concluded that some of the hazards, rather than this method, may be due to falsifying factors associated with the first cesarean given notation

 Some hazards are rare and, as with most medical methods, the likelihood of a hazard occurring is due to certain factors, such as when another pregnancy problem exists, when the operation is planned or in an emergency, and where it is Depends on what is being done

 The study, based on the causes of emergency cesarean, found that 66% of cases were in daily shifts between 8 am and 3 pm, with the lowest being between 5 am and 6 am; This led the authors to conclude that the convenience of physicians is the primary cause of "emergency caesarean"

 Royal College of Midwives' deputy secretary-general Louise Silvertone says that not only has tolerance for suffering and disease "significantly reduced" in society, but women also fear fear of suffering and think that if a caesarean If taken, the pain will be less
 Silvertone and the Royal College of Midwives believe - "women have lost confidence in their ability to give birth
" " Silvertone's analysis is controversial among some surgeons
 dow megi blott, jo landan ke ‘uniwarsity college hospital’ main ek prasav salaahkaar hai, tathaa ‘royal college of obstetrician and ginocology’ main sizerian maamle kii pravaktaa hai, kaa maananaa he, 'louis silvertone ke is vichaar ke samarthan ke liye ki, dard ke bhay se mahilaayein sizerian kii dar badha rahi hai, koi sakshya nahin he
 An implication is that caesarean section is a bad thing, but it can be life-saving
 sizerian section kii badhati dar ke liye ek purv kii anudghaatit avadharana janm bhaar tathaa maa ke pedu kaa aakaar he
 It is believed that after the arrival of successful cesarean births in the last 150 years, the mothers of small pelvic and overweight children at birth survived and the population increased due to these reasons
 Such a concept is based on the idea that the c-section rate will continue to rise further due to the slow growth in the gene structure of the population without fear of misconduct, obesity of the mother and suffering from diabetes, and without other comprehensive factors
 kuch maamalon main sizerian section chikitsiya aavashyaktaaon se bhinn anya kaarnon se bhi kiye jate hai
 The reasons for elective cesarean differ, largely due to the difference between hospital or physician-centered reasons and maternal-centered reasons
 chikitsak aadeshit sizerian ke aalochak, is baat se chintit hai ki kuch maamalon main ye isliye sampann kiye jate hai kyonki kisi aspataal ke liye yah laabhakaari hota he, kyonki twarit sizerian, ek lambey yonic janm kii tulana main prasavkarmiyon ke liye adhik suvidhajanak hota he, yaa isliye ki shalya-kriya ek tay samay par kii ja sakati he, jabaki yonic janan main prakruti ke samay par nirbhar hona padataa he or bachche kaa janm anirdhaarit samay main hota he
 
 is sandarbh main, yah yaad rakhane vaali baat he ki kai adhyayanon main yah paaya gaya he ki samay ke baad kii gai shalya-chikitsa adhik jatiltaaon vaali hoti he
 For this reason, if a caesarean is found to be correct for a woman, it should be selectively performed during the daytime surgery period, rather than waiting for an emergency to occur, leading to emergency surgery
 The reason is increased surgical and anesthetic problems
 chikitsak-aadeshit vidhiyon main ek anya kaarak chikitsa duracharan abhiyog kaa dar ho saktaa he
 Italian obstetrician Enrico Jupi, whose medical center 'rome mater Die' had a media attraction for a caesarean section in record numbers, says, "we should not be blamed
 Our methods must be understood
 Many times we doctors But legal action is taken for incidents and complications that are not classified as misdemeanors
 That is why we turned to defensive medicine Not
 jabatak chikitsiya trutiyaan gahari na ho jaaen ham is tareeke se hi aage badhate rahenge
 ham balidani nahin he
 So seeing any danger on a pregnant woman, we recommend it
 " Studies on US women have indicated that white married women who give birth in private hospitals are more likely to have a caesarean section than poor women, even if they are less likely to have complications
 But that is why she gets Caesarean section done

 sizerian section ke dauraan prayukt kshetreey nishchetak dardanivaarakon se bhinn hoti hai, jinka prayog prasav tathaa yonic janan main kiya jaataa he
 Surgical pain is more intense than delivery pain, so it requires more intense nerve blockage
 sizerian janan ke liye aavashyak nishchetak kaa twajeey str bhi prasav ke liye prayukt nishchetak se adhik hota he
 General anesthesia may be necessary due to the special dangers associated with mother and child

 Post-caesarean vaginal births are common these days, but their numbers are shrinking

 The uterus then retains its integrity better and can withstand future childbirth firmly
 prashaadhan ke rup main aadhunik sizerian main chire kaa nishaan "bikni rekha" ke neeche lagaaya jaataa he
 Obstetricians and other caregivers have different opinions about the comparative benefits of vaginal and caesarean section; Some consider it normal, some believe it not
 aadhunik prasav dekhbhaal main jis cheez par jor daalaa janaa chahie, vah yah he ki nirnay, prasav-visheshgy tathaa maa / janm dene vaale saathi ke bich kaa hona chahie, har prakaar ke janan ke khataron tathaa laabhon ke moolyankan ke baad liya janaa chahie
 jaisaa ki sabhi shalya-kriyavidhiyon main hota he, sansuchit sahmati-patr se jude rogi dwaara hastakshrit prapatr shalya-kriya se pehle hi zarur se praapt kar lenaa chahie, matra-vikalp sies ke uchit tathaa vyaavhaarik vikalpon ke kaaran jisamen rogi kii soochnaaon ko abhipramanit kiya gaya ho
 In the United States, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology reformed the guidelines for vaginal births that occurred after pre-caesarean births in 1999 and again in 2004
 These improvements to the guidelines include the following recommendations: kyonki garbhashayi vidar vinaashkari ho saktaa he, VBAC kaa prayaas aise santhaan main kiya janaa chahie jo apaat-seva ke liye uplabdh twarit chikitsakon ke saath apatakaalin sthitiyon se nipatane ke liye sakasham hon
 In some cases this recommendation had a major impact on the vbacs available to mothers giving birth in the US
 For example, a study published in 2006, based on a change in the frequency of VBAC generation in California after this change in guidelines, found that the VBAC rate fell to 13
5%, which was 24 before this change
 % Was located at VBAC
 nai anushansaaon ko kai aspataalon dwaara is prakaar vyakhyayit kiya gaya ki VBAC mahila prasav ke dauraan sizerian shalya-kriya karne hetu chikitsakon kii ek puri team maujuud rahani chahie
 jin aspataalon main vbacs kaa puri tarah se nishedh kiya gaya, unhen 'VBAC pratibandhit' aspataal mana gaya
 In such situations, the giving birth mother is forced to undergo a repeat caesarean, to find an alternative hospital in which the child can be delivered, or to have an out-of-hospital arrangement

 emperor penguin ke prajnan sthal ke faayde hai
 It is on hard ice, so there is no danger of the snow being so soft that it cannot support the herd or the chickens fall into the water before developing a waterproof cover
 yah 300 kimi prati ghante tak kii tej kii gati se bahane vaali barfili hawaaon se bache hue sangrakshit kshetra main he
 At the beginning of the Antarctic summer the breeding site is just a few meters from the water, where penguins can eat and drink
 lekin greeshm ke ant tak prajnan sthal pani or lepard sil jaise shikaariyon se se 100 kimi dur ho jaataa he
 Nevertheless, all penguins that can participate in the progeny process are mostly moving and sometimes trying to reach their breeding sites by plowing
 penguins gambhir kism ke ek patnik jeev hai matlab ek saal ke dauraan ek patnik
 yah vyavharik he - maadaa ekmaatr anda detii he or chuje ke bachane ke liye dono abhibhavakon kaa sahyog jaruri hota he
 After laying the egg, the female has to give it to the male without touching it from the ground
 yadi anda kuch pal bhi khule main rah jaae to bheeshan thand usko nasht kar degi
 The male has to take care of the egg so that the female can go back to the sea to eat and drink, and can also bring back additional food for her chick
 maadaa ne do maah se kuch khaaya nahin hota or jab tak wo santati sthal chhodti he apane bhaar kaa ek tihaai ganvaa chuki hoti he
 And for two months, males keep their priceless eggs rounded together at the feet; Do not let him fall even once
 is samay ye -62 degree celsius ke taapmaana kaa saamana karte hai or unke jal kaa ek maatr saadhan santati sthal par girane vaala paala hota he
 When the chickens come out, the male has very little food to feed them and if the females do not return soon, they have to leave their chickens and go to the sea to eat something themselves
 maadaaon ke lautne tak nar apane vajan ke aadhe rah jate hai or chaar maah se unhone kuch nahin khaaya hota
 The death of a chick is a very tragic event, but then its parents go back to the sea during the breeding season to search for food
 kabhi kabhi ek abhibhavak bachche ko chhod kar ja chuktaa he or ab baccha puri tarah se samudr se duusare abhibhavak ke lautne par nirbhar ho jaataa he, jo use uski anuthi awaz se pahchaan letaa he
 During their journey many guardians kill the hands of predatory animals and their chick is in danger at the Santi site

 jab kisi rasinic abhikriya kii gati kisi padaarth kii upasthiti maatr se batch jaati he to ise utpreran kehete hai
 The substance whose presence increases the reaction speed is called a catalyst
 utprerak abhikriya main bhaag nahin letaa, keval kriya kii gati ko prabhavit karata he
 Catalysts have a huge role in the manufacture of industrially important chemicals, as their use increases the speed of the reaction, which in many ways brings economic benefits and accelerates production
 isaliye utpreran ke kshetra main anusandhan ke liye bahut sa dhan evam maanav shram laga hua he
 First of all in 1835, Bergelyus drew attention to some chemical actions in which the speed of action would be accelerated in the presence of certain external substances, but the external matter did not participate in that activity
 udarharnarth yadi ichu sharkara ko amlon kii upasthiti main garam karen to vah badi shighrata se glucose tathaa fructose main parivartit ho jaati he
 Acid does not participate in this activity
 vah pun: kaam main liya ja saktaa he
 Bergelyus called this action "catalysis" and called those substances "catalysts" in whose presence the action begins to take place
 ostwald ne utprerak padaartho kii paribhaasha is prakaar di he: ""utprerak us padaarth ko kehete hai jo kisi rasinic kriya ke veg ko badal de, parantu swayan kriya ke ant main aparivartit rahata he, at: use pun: kaam main laayaa ja saktaa he
 In most actions, the catalyst increases the reaction speed
 aise utprerakon ko dhanatmak utprerak kehete he; parantu kuch aise bhi utprerak he jo rasinic kriya kii gati ko mand kar dete hai
 Such catalysts are called negative catalysts
 utpreran kii mukhya visheshtaayen nimnlikhit hai: Almost all catalyzed actions can be divided into two parts: isomeric catalytic actions; Activated catalytic actions
 in kriyaaon main utprerak, pratikarmak tathaa pratifal sabhi ek hi avasthaa main upasthit hote hai
 For example, in the conventional method of making sulfuric acid, sulfuric acid is formed by the combination of sulfur dioxide, steam and oxygen and this action is catalyzed by nitric oxide
 is kriya main pratikarmak, utprerak tathaa pratifal isi gasiy avasthaa main rahete hai
 In these activities, catalysts, reagents and byproducts are present in different states
 yatha, ammonia banane kii habar-vidhi main nitrogen tathaa hydrogen kii sanyogkriya kii ferick oxide utprerit karata he
 Hydrogenation of vegetable oils in the presence of micro-nickel is another example of this type of action
 kuch padaarth apni upasthiti se rasinic kriya ke veg par prabhaav nahin daalate, parantu kuch duusare utprerakon kii kriya ko prabhavit karte hai
 Among these substances, which increase the reactivity of catalysts, catalysts and those substances which reduce the reactivity of catalysts are called anti-catalysts or catalytic toxins
 aatm utprerak-kuch pratikriyaayein aisi bhi gyaat hai jinamein pratikraya se hi utpann koi padaarth pratikriya ke liye utprerak kaa kaary karata he
 For example, the acetic acid obtained in the hydrolysis of ethyl acetate catalyzes the action of ester hydrolysis
 yadhyapi utpreran ko samajhane samajhane ke liye bahut pehle se adhyayan hote chale aa rahe hai, tathaapi is vishay main abhi antim nishkarsh nahin niklaa he
 Scientists agree that not all catalysts act according to the same principle
 utpreran kii vyavastha ke liye do siddhant kaam main laae jate hai- madhyavarti yogic siddhant; adhishoshan siddhant
 1
 Intermediate Compound Theory- This is a chemical theory for explaining catalysis
 iske anusaar utprerak pehle pratikarmakon main se ek ke saath kriya karke ek madhyavarti asthaayee yogic banaata he; phir vah madhyavarti asthaayee yogic duusare pratikarmakon se kriya karke pratifal detaa he tathaa utprerak pun: apni purvavastha main aa jaataa he
 Accordingly, the combination of the reagents "a" and "b" is expressed in the presence of catalyst "c" in the following way: kriya ke ant tak yahi kram chalata rahata he
 The explanation of the catalysis of certain actions by intermediate compound theory is straightforward
 parantu adhikansh vishmavayavi kriyaaon tathaa utprerak vardhakon athwa vishon kii kriyaaon ko samajhaana kathin yaa asambhav sa he
 2
 Adsorption theory - This is the physical principle for the interpretation of catalysis
 is siddhant ke anusaar pratikarmak utprerak ke tal par ghaneebhoot ho jate hai
 Thus by increasing the concentration of reagents at the catalyst plane, the velocity of action increases according to the quantity-proportional-law
 ab uparyukt donon siddhanton ko milakar ek nayaa siddhant pratipaadit kiya gaya he
 Accordingly, there are some active centers at the bottom of the catalytic material
 in kendron main anuon yaa parmaanuon ko adhishoshit karne kii kshamta hoti he
 Therefore, due to the dense ghosting of the reagents at the bottom of the metal, the solidity increases, due to which the action is increased, as well as the repellents at these active centers form temporary compounds with them, which according to the intermediate compound theory Let's do the work
 prakinv jatil jaivik padaarth hote hai jo paudhon yaa praaniyon se praapt kiye jate hai
 They have proved to be excellent catalysts in most reactions
 ped paudhon main honevaali lagbhag sabhi kriyaaon main anzime utprerak kaa kaary karte hai
 Apart from this, fermentation also acts as an activity in our body, digestion of specialty food
 or ek or Catalysts have proved very useful in industrial and chemical fields
 nitrogen kaa sthirikaran utprerit kriyaao kaa ek saadhaaran udhaaharan he
 For tree plants, the availability of permanent nitrogen is in the form of nitrate or ammonia
 nitrogen ke ye donon hi rup utprerako kii sahaayta se nirmit hote rahete hai
 During the Second World War, the fuel used in driving motor vehicles in almost all the world was prepared only with the help of catalysts
 utpreran dwaara petroleum se bahut se aise padaarth banaae jate the jo idhan ke rup main kaam main laae jate the
 In addition, catalytic actions have other importance, for example in the manufacture of synthetic rubber from butadiene and styrene, the manufacture of sulfuric acid, and in the manufacture of vegetable ghee by hydrogenation of vegetable oils in the presence of finely fragmented nickel, etc

 Natural selection is the main process of evolution
 charles darwin ne isaki neenv rakhi or iskaa prachaar-prasar kiya
 This mechanism is particularly important because it helps a species to adapt to the environment
 prakritik chayan kaa siddhant isaki vyakhya kar saktaa he ki paryaavaran kis prakaar prajatiyon or jansankhya ke vikaas ko prabhavit karata he taaki wo sabase upyukt lakshanon kaa chayan kar saken
 This is the fundamental aspect of the theory of development
 prakritik chayan kaa arth un gunon se he jo kisi prajati ko bache rahane or prajnan me sahaayta karte hai or isaki aavriti peedi dar peedi badhati rahati he
 This further rationalizes the fact that the holders of these symptoms have more children and can also inherit this property

 According to this theory, the upper layer of the earth, about 80 to 100 km thick, which is called Sthalmandal, and which includes the earth's crust and the upper part of the earth's crust, is broken into several pieces called plates
 ye platen neeche sthit asthenosphere kii ardhapighalit parat par tair raheen hai or saamanyatya lagbhag 10-40 mimi / varsh kii gati se gatisheel hai haalaanki inamen kuch kii gati 160 mimi / varsh bhi he
 The movement of these plates presents an explanation of the origin and mountain formation of the earth's present surface pattern and it has been observed that often earthquakes fall on the boundaries of these plates and volcanoes are also found along these plate boundaries

 There are many variations in the number of small plates, but their number is generally accepted more than 100

 That is, some people believed that the size of the Earth was reduced by contraction after the origin and as a result of this contraction the forces on the surface of the earth are located and the twists are located in the form of mountains

 On the contrary, some believed that the continents have moved horizontally and due to the collision, the force in the upper surface has created mountains

 Later American geographer FB Taylor spoke of a kind of flow of continents by the gravitational force of the moon in 1908–10, and also attributed it to the origin of the Tertiary era mountains
 par unki baat par kisi ne bahut dhyaan nahin diya
 Wagner, who was an archaeologist and archaeologist, proposed the idea that the distribution of climate in ancient times could be interpreted if the continents were to be considered dynamic and he proposed the theory of continental displacement in 1912 which His book, published in 1915, was published in Origins of Continents and Oceans
 wagonar ne hi sabase pehle "mahadwipiya visthaapan" shabd kaa prayog kiyawagonar ke isi siddhanth se aage chalakar plate vivartaniki kaa vikaas sambhav ho paaya haalaanki lagbhag aadhi sadi tak unke vichaaron ko bhi vidwaanon dwaara nakaara jaataa rahaa jab tak 1960 ke dashak main pramaan nahin uplabdh hue

 Normally, rubbing each other using this edge moves in opposite directions, but it is not mandatory, if two plates move in the same direction and their motion is different, they can still form a protective edge by rubbing their edges
 inke sahare transform bhransh paae jate hai
 Since neither the plate nor the destruction is formed, they are called protective / protective edges where the status quo is preserved in the context of construction / destruction

 The tilt of the axis of Mercury is lower than any other planet in the Solar System, but the orbital decentralization is the highest
 budh grah apsur par upsaur kii tulana main surya se kareeb 1

 The Earth of Mercury is lined with craters and looks exactly like our moon, indicating that it has been geologically dead for years
 budh ko prithvi jaise anya grahon ke samaan mausamon kaa koi bhi anubhav nahin he
 It is fastened so its path of rotation is unique in the solar system

 From the Sun's side, in a frame of reference that rotates at an orbital speed, it is seen to rotate only once every two years
 is kaaran budh grah par koi paryvekshak ek diwas harek do varshon kaa dekhegaa
 Since Mercury's orbit lies within the Earth's orbit, it can appear in the Earth's sky in the morning or in the evening, but not at midnight

 If the effect of gravitational compression is divided into factors, then the material the Mercury is made of will be the densest, with an uncoordinated density of 5
3 g / cm3 vs
 4
4 g / cm3 of Earth
 budh kaa ghanatv iske andruni gathan ke vivaran ke anumaan ke liye prayukt ho saktaa he
 The Earth's high density is high due to its strong gravitational compression, especially the core, as opposed to Mercury being very small and its inner regions not as compressed
 isliye, is tarah ke kisi ucch ghanatv ke liye, iskaa kor bada or louh se samrudh avashya hona chahie
 Geologists estimate that Mercury's core occupies about 42% of its volume; This ratio for the Earth is 17%

 antariksh yaan meriner-10 va messanger donon se mili maapnon ne darshaya he ki chumbakeey kshetra kaa aakaar va shakti sthaayee he
 This magnetic field appears to have been generated by a dynamo effect
 is lihaaj se yah prithvi ke chumbakeey kshetra ke samaan he
 This dynamo effect may have been the result of the circulation of the planet's iron-rich liquid core
 vishesh rup se grah kii ucch kakshiya vicendratha dwaara uptann shaktishaalee jwariya prabhaav ne kor ko taral avasthaa main rakhaa hoga jo ki dynamo prabhaav ke liye aavashyak he
 Mercury's magnetic field is powerful enough to bend the solar wind around the planet, creating a magnetosphere
 is grah kaa magnetosphere, yadhyapi prithvi ke bheetar samaa jane jitna chota he, par saura vaayu plasma ko fansane ke liye paryaapt majboot he
 This contributes to the space weathering of the planet's surface

 The main question is that who had the right to own land - the state, the peasant or any middle class, according to the opinion of the scholars, this right was the right in ancient India, which cannot be called the right of self

 But even in this crisis, the rights of the farmers were not fully surrendered
 bharat main angrejon ke aagamankaal se hi jameendaari pratha kaa udai hone laga
 The British rulers believed that they were the owners of the land and the farmers were their subjects, so they made permanent and temporary arrangements with big farmers and kings and landlords
 yadhyapi raajnneetik auchity se prabhavit hokar usne ek ek pargana har kar vasuul karanevaale ijaaredaar ko paanch varsh ke liye patte par de diya
 Thus, the Zamindari system was recognized by the British, although initially it was not their idea to deprive the peasants of their rights, Lord Corn Wallis became the Governor General in 1786, after Warren Hastigze

 The zamindari system emerged in Madras through the auction policy of the British rulers
 gaanvon kii bhoomi kaa vibhaajan kar unhen nilaam kar diya jaataa tha or adhiktam mulya denevaale ko vikray kar diya jaataa tha
 Initially, the settlement in Awadh was done by the cultivator but later it was settled with the landlords due to political reasons

 This is the simplest way to collect unjust amount of money and it is also useful from the point of view of politics because as a result, a powerful and rich section of the government will continue to get help
 is prakaar bharatvarsh ke itihaas main sarvapratham in bandobaston dwaara rajya or krishakon ke bich main jameendaaron kaa varg angrejon kii niti dwaara sthapit hua jiske fal swaroop krishakon ke bhu-sampatti adhikaar, jo anadi kaal se chale aa rahe the, chhin gaye
 This intermediate class became wealthier day by day as the British rulers continued to give more and more of their money as a bait
 in bandobaston main krishakon ke hiton kii ore koi dhyaan nahin diya gaya tha jiske parinamswaroop unka du:kha, apmaan evam daridray din pratidin badhata gaya
 Many times the British rulers also pointed out that the land tenure of the farmers should be protected and their rent should be fixed till the time of settlement
 phir bhi kuch nahin kiya gaya
 The reason for this was that the British rulers believed that when they would be prosperous and satisfied in showing leniency in dealing with the zamindars, they would not persecute their assassins, as a result of which they would also be happy
 parantu yah unki mahaan bhul thi kyonki jameendaaron ne hameshaa hi apane kartavya ke saath vishwasghaat kiya
 Therefore, the British rulers felt that this mistake should be rectified
 falswaroop unhone krishakon kii dasha sudhaarney ke liye bhoomi sambandhi vidhaanon kii vyavastha kii
 This step can be called the first step towards the end of Zamindari system

 But the main purpose of these laws was to facilitate the zamindars in collecting the revenue so that they can give revenue to the state at the right time
 san 1859 i0 main bhoomi sambandhi pehla adhinium paas hua
 This Act was an ideal land-act for all British India, according to which the Act passed in all parts of India and amendments were made from time to time to pacify the disgruntled farmers
 kintu jameendaar phir bhi krishakon ko apane nyaaypurna tathaa anyaaypurna karon ko vasuulne ke liye nichodte rahe jisase kisaanon main ghor asantosh tathaa bechaini failene lagi
 The second phase of the Zamindari system took place from 1930 AD to 1944 AD
 is samay main saare desh main kisaan andolan hone lage
 The seed of these movements was sown by a Kisan Sabha which took place on 11 February 1918 in Allahabad meeting of All India Congress

 As a result, there was a lot of awareness among the rural masses

 Influenced by the peasant movements, new Acts were enacted in the Ryotwadi areas to protect the interests of the farmers

 Therefore, the Indian National Congress has several times announced that the abolition of Zamindari should give a prominent place in the Congress program
 ek kisaan conference taarikh 27,28 april san 1935 i0 ko sardaar patel ke sabhapatitv main elahabaad main hui thi
 He took a major step towards this by passing the proposal for the abolition of Zamindari, in this proposal it was declared that 'the present Zamindari system is completely opposite from the view of Gramakalyan
 yah pratha british shashan ke aagaman main laai gai or isse gramin jivan purnataya tahas nahas ho gaya he’
 But as World War II started in 1939, the entire program of land reform was halted
 yuddh kii samaapti ke baad jameendaari pratha ke ant kaa antim charan aarambh hua jo san 1945 se 1955 tak chalaa
 At the end of the war, the British government decided to elect provincial houses in 1945 under the Government of India Act 1935
 congress ne chunaav main bhaag lene kaa nishchay kiya or disambar 1945 main chunaav ghoshnaptr nikaala
 In this manifesto, regarding the abolition of Zamindari, it was clearly stated that 'the improvement of the land system, which is most needed in India, is related to the removal of the middle class between the farmers and the state
 isliye is madhyavarti varg ke adhikaron kaa uchit pratikar dekar praapt kar liya janaa chahie’
 Economists, politicians and journalists all agreed with this manifesto
 jameendaari pratha bhartiya aarthik vikaas main rukawat daalati thi kyonki bade jameendaar hameshaa pratikriyavaad ke samarthak the
 The 'london Economist' wrote about them that 'most of these' Thackerseys' characters were as lame as' Lord Stein ', lazy like' Jane Austen '' Mr
 Bennet ',' Surtijsquire 'drunk
 bengal land kamishan bhi is nishkarsh par pahunchaa ki ‘san 1793 i0 kaa sthaayee bandobast us samay jin bhi kaarnon se uchit samajha gaya ho, aaj kii paristhiti main anupyukt he or jameendaari pratha main itani buraaiyaan upaj chuki he ki yah ab raashtra ke hit main kisi bhi prakaar upyogi nahin rah gai he
 'in the opinion of Indian and Western economists, the abolition of zamindari is necessary for more agricultural production
 iske atirikt yah pratha sansar ke har bhaag main samyaanukool na hone ke kaaran samaapt ho chuki he
 PS, this practice is more expensive for the state
 sarvopari, yah pratha is samay aisi sthiti par pahunch chuki thi ki yadi iskaa unmoolan na kiya gaya hota to iske kaaran ne keval rashtriya aarthik samasya par hi varan samaaj suraksha par bhi vipatti aa padati
 Therefore, as a result of the success of elections in 1946, when the Congress cabinet was formed in every province, a bill was introduced to abolish the Zamindari system according to the election pledge
 ye vidheyak san 1950 i0 se 1955 i0 tak adhinium banakar chaalu ho gaye jinke parinamswaroop jameendaari pratha kaa bharat main unmoolan ho gaya or krishakon evam rajya ke bich pun: sidhaa sambandh sthapit ho gaya
 The landowners now got back to the farmers which they had been using since time immemorial
 is prakaar jis jameendaari pratha kaa udai hamaare desh main angrejon ke aagaman se hua tha uskaa ant bhi unke shashan ke samaapt hote hi ho gaya
 At the end of this practice, no one mourned at all, because the old theory, according to which the owner of the land used to be an agriculturist, recurred as soon as it was destroyed

 bhartiya film ke itihaas main yah pehali baar hua he, jab kisi film ke liye ek nai bhashaa kaa nirmaan kiya gaya ho
 Queen Shivagami of Mahishmati, one of the ancient kingdoms of India, comes out to adopt a baby from the den near a huge waterfall
 vah badi nidarta se apane peechha karte sipaahiyon ko maar daalati he or shishu kii raksha khatir swayan ke praan balidaan detii he
 At the last moment, the local villagers see the baby in the arm above the queen immersed in water and save the child safely
 is tarah rani parvat kii oonchaai se girte jalprapaat main dub kar villin hoti he
 Sanga and her husband name the baby Shiva and raise their children the same way
 guzarate samay ke saath shiva ek balavaan yuvak ke rup main bada hota he jisaki aakanksha parvat chadhane kii rahati he or kai baar kii vah naakaam praytn karata he
 Every day, he gets a mask of a young woman flowing in a waterfall
 us yuvati kii pahchaan dhundne kii chaah main, vah punah parvat chadhaai kaa prayaas karata he or aakhirkaar vah safal bhi hota he
 At the summit of the falls, Shiva discovers Avantika, the owner of the facade, a rebel warrior whose team is fighting a war against King Bhallal Deva / Pallavathevan of the Mahishmati Empire through guerrilla methods
 dal kaa lakshya he ki ve purv maharani devsena ko chhudaae jinhen rajmahal main gat 25 varshon se zajiron main jakad rakhaa he
 And this important responsibility has been assigned to Avantika
 avanatika ko shiva kii yah baat sun prem hota he ki vah is jalprapaat kii tamaam mushkilon par chadhaai karata hua sirf uske liye aayaa he
 Shiva now pledges to take the responsibility of this campaign and sneak into Mahishmati and free Devasena from captivity
 shiva use chhudaa laata he or saath lekar bhaag nikalataa he magar jald hi raja kaa shahi gulam kattappa, jinhen behtareen yudhkaushal ke liye janaa jaataa he, uske peeche padataa he
 But the ambush Bhadra, son of Bhallal Dev, suddenly strikes Shiva's head, but Katappa drops his weapon when he comes to know that Shiva is actually Mahendra Bahubali, son of the late King Amarendra Bahubali
 phir yahaan bhootkaal main hue raja amrendra bahubali kii vigat ghatnaon kaa ullekh hota he
 Amarendra's mother dies after his birth, while the father passed away long before that
 shivagaamee apane angrakshak katappa ke sahyog se nae raja chune tak samrajya ke shashan kii bagdor sambhalati he
 She raises Amarendra Bahubali and Bhallal Dev equally; she is well-versed in many disciplines and training such as art, science, trickery, politics and martial arts, but both have different ambitions for the rule of the empire
 
 jahaan amrendra bahubali kaa logon ke prati udaaravaadi vyavhaar karte he to bhallaal dev behad kathor hai or apane lakshya prapti ke liye har sambhav nishthurataa baratata he, yahaan tak ki vah bahubali kii hatya bhi kara dete he
 When Mahishmati is challenged to battle by the enemy Kalakeyas, Sivagami vows that whoever beheads the king of the Kalakayas will be made the new king and thus orders for equal sharing of war between the two grandchildren
 is
 lekin bhallaal dev ke apahiz pita, bijjala dev, chal-prapanch dwaara bhallaal ko adhik se adhik yuddh saadhan muhaiyaa karaata he
 In the battle when Mahishmati fails once and realizes his end, Amarendra re-motivates his soldiers to fight against him from the dead and ends the war by crushing the enemies
 magar bhallaal dev pehle hi kalaakeya ke raja kaa vadh kar detaa he, shivagaamee bataur naye shaasha ke rup main amrendra bahubali kaa chayan uske yuddh main shreshthata or netritvta ke faisle par ghoshnaa karti he to bhallaal dev ko uske saahas or parakram ke liye senanayake banaati he
 After these earlier incidents, when questioned about King Amarendra, the emotional Katappa speaks of the death of the king, and Katappa holds himself responsible for his death
