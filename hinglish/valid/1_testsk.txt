 aspirin, jise acetilasalisylic acid, bhi kehete hai, ek salicyllette aushadhi he, jo akasar halke dardon se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye dardanivarak ke rup main, fever kam karne ke liye jvershamak ke rup main or shoth-nirodhi dawa ke rup main prayog main laai jaati he
 Aspirin also has an anti-platelet effect, which arises from the inhibition of thromboxane production, which in normal circumstances binds the molecules of platelets together to form a rash on the bruises within the blood vessels
 chunki plateleton kaa chakatta kaaphi bada hokar rakt-pravaah main us sthaan par yaa aage kahin bhi rukawat paidaa kar saktaa he, isaliye rakt ke thakkon ke vikaas ke adhik jokham vaale logon main aspirin kaa prayog lambey samay ke liye kam maatra main hridayaghat, mastishk-aghat or rakt ke thakkon kii rokthaam ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 It has also been found that a small amount of aspirin immediately after a heart attack can reduce the risk of another heart attack or cardiac tissue death
 aspirin ke, visheshkar adhik maatra main lene par, mukhya avaanchit dushprabhavon main amashay va aanton main chhaale, amashay main raktasrav or kaanon main aawaaj aana shaamil hai
 Due to the risk of Reye's syndrome in children and adolescents, aspirin is no longer used to control flu-like symptoms or symptoms of varicella or other virus diseases
 aspirin nonsteroidel antiinflemetary drugs naamak varg kaa sabase pehla sadsy he, jinamein se sabhi salicyllette nahin hote, haalanki sabhi ke ek samaan prabhaav hote hai or adhikanshtah anzime cychlooxijnez kaa avrodh karte hai
 Today, aspirin is one of the most used drugs in the world, with an estimated intake of 40,000 tonnes per year
 jin deshon main aspirin bear kaa registerd trademark he, vahaan uskaa generik naam acetile seleselic acid he
 a French chemist, Charles Friedrich Gerhardt, first made acetylsalicylic acid in 1853
 vibhinn acid enhydron ke sanshleshan or gunon par uske kaary ke dauraan usne acetile chloride ko salicylic acid ke sodium lavan ke saath mishrit kiya
 a vigorous reaction ensued and the molten compound quickly solidified into a solid
 chunki un dinon main koi rachanaatmak siddhant nahin hua karata tha, isaliye jerheart ne us yogic kaa naam salicylic-acetic enhydride rakhaa
 
 This aspirin production was one of the many reactions Gerhardt did to his paper on anhydrides and did nothing further
 chah varsho ke baad, 1859 main won gilm ne salicylic acid or acetal chloride kii pratikriya dwaara vishleshnatmak rup se shuddh acetilasalicylic acid praapt kii
 In 1869, Schroeder, Prinzahrn and Kraut repeated the syntheses of both Gerhardt and von Gilm, and stated that both of these reactions yield the same compound — acetyl salicylic acid
 unhone pehali baar isaki sahi rachana–phinolic oxygen se jude acetile samooh–ke rup main darshai
 In 1897, scientists at the drug and dye firm Bayer began investigating acetylsalicylic acid as a low-dose replacement for common salicylate drugs in those days
 1899 tak bear ne iskaa naam aspirin rakh diya tha or duniya bhar main vikray karne lagi thi
 The name aspirin is derived from acetyl and spirsour - an old name for salicylic acid
 aspirin kii lokapriyata beesvin shatabdi main 1918 ke spanish flu kii vishwamahamari main iske sambhavit prabhaav ke kaaran bad gai
 But recent research suggests that the high death rate in the 1918 flu was due to aspirin to some extent, because the amount of aspirin used at the time can cause toxicity, fluid in the lungs and in some cases secondary bacterial infections, and fatal
 Might be possible

 The same chemical formula is used in all markets but each has its own packing and physical aspects
 aspirin migraine ke ilaaj ke liye prayukt mukhya aushadhiyon main se ek he, jo 50-60% maamalon main aaraam pahunchaati he
 This new tryptan drug is as effective as sumatriptan and other analgesics such as paracetamol or ibuprofen
 aspirin, paracitamaal or caffeine kaa sanyog or bhi adhik prabhaavshaalee he
 For migraine headaches, this formula works better than taking all three components separately, and even better than ibuprofen and sumatriptan

 In relevant tension headaches, aspirin relieves pain in 60–75% of patients
 is drushti se, amashay va aanton main dushprabhavon kii adhikta ke sivaa, yah paracitamaal ke baraabar he
 Comparative clinical studies found that metamizole and ibuprofen can relieve pain more rapidly than aspirin, but this difference becomes negligible after about 2 hours
 aspirin main 60-130 migra caffeine mila dene par sirdard main dardanivarak asar bad jaataa he
 The combination of aspirin, paracetamol and caffeine is even more effective, but causes more abdominal discomfort, nervousness, and dizziness
 saamanytah aspirin halke, spandanyukt dard main acha kaam karti he
 It is not effective in the pain caused by most muscle spasms, flatulence, gastric dilation and skin irritation
 The most commonly studied pain example is post-surgical pain, such as post-tooth extraction, for which the most permissible amount of aspirin is equal to 1 gram paracetamol, 60 mg codeine, and 5 mg oxycodone
 akele aspirin ke mukaable aspirin or caffeine kaa sanyog dard se adhik raahat pahunchaata he
 Effervescent reduces pain faster than aspirin containing aspirin tablets
 phir bhi, shalyakriya ke baad prayukt dardanivarak ke rup main aspirin ibuprophen se kam asardaar he
 Aspirin causes more stomach and intestinal toxicity than ibuprofen
 aspirin kii adhiktam maatra ibuprophen kii madhyam maatra se kam dardanivarak kshamta rakhti he or yah raahat usase kam der tak bani rahati he
 The combination of aspirin and codeine has slightly more pain relieving capacity than aspirin alone, but clinically this difference does not matter much
 Ibuprofen seems to be at least equal to, or possibly more effective with, this combination
 maahvaaree ke dard ke liye kiye gaye naidanik adhyayanon ke ek vishleshan ke anusaar aspirin plasibo kii apeksha adhik lekin ibuprophen yaa napraksen kii apeksha kam prabhavakaari paaya gaya, haalanki in adhyayanon main aspirin kii adhiktam matraaon kaa prayog kabhi nahin kiya gaya
 The authors found that ibuprofen has the best risk-benefit ratio
 cycle chalaane kii kasarat ke samay aspirin se dard main aaraam nahin aayaa, jabaki ascharyajanak rup se caffeine bahut asardaar thi
 Likewise, aspirin, codeine, or paracetamol were no better than placebo in muscle pain after exercise

 Secondary prevention is related to people already suffering from cardiovascular diseases
 mastishkaghaton or hridayaghaton kii dwitiyak rokthaam ke liye kam maatra main aspirin kii sifarish kii jaati he
 In both men and women diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, aspirin reduces the likelihood of heart attack and stroke resulting from blocked blood flow by up to 20 percent
 iskaa arth hradvahini rogon se pehle se grast logon main aisi ghatnaayen hone kii param dar main 8

 Although aspirin doubles the risk of haemorrhage and other major hemorrhages resulting from hemorrhage, such events are less likely and the effects of aspirin are overall positive
 is tarah dwitiyak rokthaam adhyayanon main aspirin dwaara mrityudar main 10 pratishat tak kami laai gai
 In people who do not suffer from cardiovascular diseases, the benefits of aspirin are not clear
 praathmik rokthaam ke prayogon main aspirin ne hridayaghat or kam raktapravaah se utpann mastishkaghat kii kul ghatnaon main 10 pratishat kii kami laai
 But, since these incidents are rare, the ultimate reduction in their rate was less -0
57% to 0
51% per annum
 In addition, the risks of hemorrhagic stroke and gastric and intestinal bleeding make the benefits of aspirin almost negligible
 is tarah praathmik rokthaam prayogon main aspirin se kul mrityudar main koi kami nahin ai

 Expert institutions differ in their opinion about the use of aspirin for primary prevention
 yues government priventive services task force anumaanit bhavishya ke jokham or rogi kii pasand ke aadhaar par har maamle main vishisht chunaav karne kii sifarish kii he
 On the other hand, the antithrombotic trialist association has argued that such recommendations are inappropriate because the relative risk reduction in primary prevention experiments with aspirin was similar in people with high and low risk and not dependent on blood pressure

 bukhaar or dard ke kam ho jane ke baad aspirin ke ilaaj kii jarurat nahin hoti kyonki yah hriday kii samasyaon or rumetic hriday rog kii ghatnaon ko kam nahin karata he
 In addition, high doses of aspirin cause liver toxicity in approximately 20% of children, who are the majority of patients with rheumatic fever, and increase the risk of Reye's syndrome

 jarnal of clinical aankology main prakashit ek 2010 ke lekh main yah dekha gaya he ki aspirin stan cancer se mrityu ke jokham ko kam kar sakati he
 While this information has been well disseminated by the media, there has been concern over government aspiring and medical groups expressing aspirin as a magic drug
 jin logon ko ibuprophen yaa napraksen se allergy ho, yaa salicyllette ke prati asahyata ho yaa eneidiyon ke prati asahyata ho, unhen aspirin nahin lenaa chaiye or dame yaa eneidi dwaara utpann brankospasm vaale logon ko saavdhaanee baratani chaiye

 People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because aspirin blocks the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid and thus may increase the intensity of these diseases
 sardi yaa influenza ke lakshanon kaa niyantram karne ke liye bacchon yaa kishoron ko aspirin nahin deni chaiye kyonki iskaa sambandh reiz syndrome se joda gaya he
 In some people, aspirin does not have as strong an effect on platelets as others, which is called aspirin resistance or insensitivity

 aspirin kaa prayog jathrantriy raktasrav ke jokham ko badhaata he
 Although enteric-coated formulations of aspirin are advertised to be safe for the stomach, one study found that enteric coating does not reduce this risk
 aspirin ke saath anya eneidiyon ke prayog se bhi yah khatra bad jaataa he
 Use of aspirin with clopidogrel or warfarin also increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding
 aspirin ke ek metabolite, salicyllette kii badi matraaen arakidonic acid or enemdie graahakon ke cascad par kriya ke jariye, kaanon main ghantiyon kii aawaaj utpann kar sakati hai, aisa chuhon par kiye gaye prayogon ke aadhaar par darshaya gaya he
 Reye's syndrome, a serious disease that causes acute brain disorders and fatty liver, can occur by giving aspirin to children and adolescents for fever or other diseases or infections
 1981 se 1997 tak you es centres for disease control and privansion main 18 se kam aayu ke rogiyon main reiz syndrome ke 1207 maamle darj karaae gaye

9% bacchon main, jinke jaanch ke parinaam uplabdh hue, rakt main salicyllette paaya gaya
 When safety measures were taken to prevent it after the association between Reese's syndrome and aspirin was confirmed, aspirin use in children in the United States, as well as Reise's syndrome, decreased significantly
 united kingdom main bhi bacchon main aspirin ke prayog ke bare main chetavanee jari hone ke baad aisi hi kami dekhi gai
 The United States Food and Drugs Administration now recommends that aspirin should not be given to children under 12 for febrile treatment, and the British Metiches and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency recommends that children under 16 be treated without a doctor Aspirin should not be given as advised
 kuch logon main, aspirin ke kaaran allergy pratikriya ke samaan lakshan utpann ho sakate hai jinamein hikez, sujan or sirdard shaamil hai
 This reaction is caused by salicylate intolerance, and the inability to metabolize even a small amount of aspirin, rather than an actual allergy, leading to an overdose in the body
 aspirin kuch logon main angeoedima utpann kar sakati he
 Angioedema occurred 1–6 hours after taking aspirin in some people participating in a study
 lekin akele aspirin lene par in rogiyon main angeoedima nahin hui – angeoedima tab utpann hui jab aspirin kisi anya eneidi dawa ke saath lee gai
 Aspirin increases the risk of fine bleeding in the brain, ie deep rashes 5–10 mm or smaller are seen on an MRI scan

 Aspirin can be prolonged bleeding up to 10 days after surgery
 ek adhyayan main 30 rogiyon ko unki shalyakriya ke baad nigaraanee main rakhaa gaya
 Twenty out of thirty patients had to undergo additional unplanned operations for post-operative bleeding
 In 19 of 20 patients, this bleeding was found to be related to use with aspirin alone or any other NSAID
 duusare aaparishan ke baad thik hone main ausatan 11 din lage
 The dose for fever or joint edema in adults is usually taken four times a day, while historically the maximum daily doses have been used to treat rheumatic fever

 Or the expected benefit of a reduction in stroke in women weighing more than the expected increase in gastrointestinal bleeding
 niyamit kam khuraaq main aspirin kaa prayog karne waalon main hradvahini rog se mrityu kaa jokham 25% kam or kisi bhi kaaran se mrityu kaa jokham 14% kam tha
 Using aspirin in low doses has also been found to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and low doses of aspirin may prove to be effective and safe for patients who require aspirin for long-term prevention
 kawasaki rog se grast bacchon ko aspirin shaareerik vajan ke aadhaar par nishchit khuraaqon main di jaati he, prarambh main do hafton tak din main chaar baar or phir chah se aath hafton tak kam maatra main rojaanaa ek baar di jaati he
 Excessive intake of aspirin may be acute or chronic
 acute vishaaktata main, ek badi khuraaq lee jaati he, jabaki dirghakaalik vishaktata main saamaanya se adhik khuraaq lambey samay tak lee gai hoti hai
 The death rate from acute overdose is 2%
 dirdhakalik overdos aam taur par ghaatak hota he or isaki mrityu dar 25% he
 Chronic overdose is particularly severe in children
 vishaaktata kaa upachaar anekon tareekon se kiya jaataa he, jaise – activated charcol, intravinus dextros or narmal sailine, sodium bicarbonate or dyalisis
 In 1971, British pharmacologist John Robert Wayne, who then worked at the Royal College of Surgeons in London, showed that aspirin reduced the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes
 is khoj ke liye unhen 1982 main physialaji or medicine, donon main nobel puraskaar diya gaya or nisehud se sammanit kiya gaya
 Aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible neutralization of the cyclooxygenase enzyme
 cychlooxijnez kii aavashyaktaa prastaglandin or thrambaksen ke sanshleshan ke liye padati he
 Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent in place of the acetyl group attached to the serine residue in the active site of the PTGS enzyme
 yah baat aspirin ko anya eneseidion se bhinn karti he, jo ki parivartaneey avarohak hote hai
 The use of long-term aspirin in small amounts irreversibly inhibits the production of thromboxane A2 in platelets, causing an inhibitory effect on platelet coagulation
 aspirin kaa yah skandan virdohi gun use hridayaghat kii ghatnaon ko kam karne main upyogi banaata he
 40 mg of aspirin per day can block a large proportion of maximal thromboxane A2 production without affecting the synthesis of prostaglandin I2
 lekin isse adhik avrodh ke liye aspirin kii adhik maatra kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Prostaglandins are endemic hormones produced in the body and have various effects in the body, including sending pain information to the brain, modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation
 thrambaxenon kaa kaary plateleton kii jamaavat karnaa hota he jisase rakt ke thakke banate hai
 Heart attacks are primarily due to blood clots and low dose aspirin is useful for effective medical treatment of heart attacks
 iskaa mukhya dushprabhav yah he ki chunki rakt ke jamane kii kshamta kam ho jaati he, isaliye aspirin ke prayog se atyadhik rakt srav ho saktaa he
 There are at least two different types of cyclooxygenase - PTGS1 and PTGS2
 Aspirin irreversibly inhibits PTGS1 and modulates the enzymatic activity of PTGS2
 saamanytah pitijies2 prastenoidon kaa utpaadan karata he, jo adhikanshtah shothprerak hote hai
 Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, which are mostly anti-inflammatory
 amashyantreey dushprabhavon ko kam karne ke uddeshy se pitijies2 selective avarohak naamak nai eneidi dawaaon kaa vikaas kiya gaya he jo keval pitijies2 kaa avrodh karti hai
 However, many new ones such as Viacs have recently been withdrawn because there has been evidence that PTGS2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack
 yah kaha gaya he ki sharir kii maheen raktanalikaaon kii bhitari parton main maujuud endothelial koshikaayen pitijies2 utpann karti hai or vishesh rup se pitijies2 kaa avrodh karne se prastaglandin ke utpaadan kaa thrambaksen ke mukaable downaregulation ho jaataa he, kyonki plateleton main pitijies1 aprabhavit rahete hai
 This removes the protective anticoagulant effect of PGI2, increasing the risk of thrombus and accompanying heart attacks and other hemorrhagic problems
 chunki plateleton main diene nahin hota he, ve ek baar aspirin dwaara anzime ko aparivartaneey rup se avaruddha kar dene ke baad nae pitijies kaa sanshleshan nahin kar sakate, jo ki aspirin kii parivartaneey avarodhakon kii tulana main mahatvapurn bhinnata he
 Aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional mechanisms
 yah bhitari kala shunya se proton vaahak ke rup main mitrocandrial matrix, jahaan yah ek baar phir ynikrut hokar proton detii he, main waapas prasaarit hokar, cartillej ke mitocandria main oxykaarak phospharilation ko viyugalikrut karti he
 In short, aspirin transports the proteins by buffering them
 jab alpirin kii badi matraaen di jaati hai, to electron transport chen dwaara ooshmaa mukt kiye jane se aspirin vastav main fever utpann karti he, jabaki kam khuraaqon main aspirin bukhaar kam karti he
 In addition, aspirin promotes the formation of no-roots in the body, which have been shown to be independent mechanisms of reducing inflammation in mice
 yah shwet raktakanon ko aapas main chipakane se roktaa he, jo sankraman ke prati rakshaatmak pratikriya main mahatvapurn kadam he
 There is not enough evidence yet to prove that aspirin helps fight infection
 haal main praapt jaankaree ke anusaar aspirin or uske yogic sanketon ko nf-κb ke jariye madulate karte hai
 nf-κb is a transcription factor complex that plays a central role in many biological processes including inflammation
 aspirin hypothalemic-pituitary-adrenal dhuree dwaara asit or cartisal kaa srav karne ke baad vaisopracin ke prabhaavon ko kam or naloxon ke prabhaavon ko badhaati he
 It has been stated that this occurs through an interaction between endogenous prostaglandins and their role in controlling the HPA axis
 salicylic acid ek halkaa amla he or munh se lene ke baad isaki bahut kam maatra kaa amashay main ynikaran hota he
 Acetyl salicylic acid is much less soluble in the acidic state of the stomach, which can delay the absorption of large doses by 8 to 24 hours
 choti aant ke bade hue piech ke alaava, adhik satahi kshetrafal ke kaaran aspirin vahaan teji se avashoshit hoti he, jisase salicyllette adhik maatra main ghulte hai
 Due to solubility, the absorption of aspirin is very slow when taken in high doses and its concentrations in plasma can increase up to 24 hours after its intake
 rakt main salicyllette kaa lagbhag 50-80% protein se judaa hota he jabaki baaki maatra sakriy, ynikrut sthiti main hoti he
 Protein binding is dependent on the concentration
 bandhan ke sthanon ke santrupt ho jane par adhik mukt salicyllette kii uplabdhi or vishaaktata main vrudghi ho jaati he
 The volume of distribution is 0
1 to 0
2 l / kg
 acidosis main salicylleton ke utakon main adhik pravesh ke kaaran vitaran kaa aaytan bad jaataa he
 80% of the dose given for the treatment of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver
 glysine se sandhukt hokar salicyloorik acid banataa he or glucuronic acid se sanyukt hokar salissyle acil or phinalik glakuronide banate hai
 These metabolic pathways have limited capacity
 salicylic acid kii laghu matraaen hydraxilit hokar jentisik acid banaati hai
 With large amounts of salicylate the kinetics is displaced from the first position to the void space, as metabolic pathways are saturated and the drainage from the kidneys increases in importance
 salicyllette gurdon dwaara mukhyatah salicyloorik acid, mukt salicylic acid, salicylic phinol or esile glucuronidon va jantisik acid ke rup main nishkasit hote hai
 When taken in small quantities all routes run by first-rate dynamics and the extracted half-life is about 2 to 4
5 hours
 salicylleton kii badi matraaon ke lene par ardhajivan kaaphi lanbaa ho jaataa he kyonki salicyloorik acid or salicil phinolic glucuronide ke banane se sambandhit jaevparivartan maarg santrupt ho jate hai
 Renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes more important when the metabolic pathways are saturated because it is extremely sensitive to the ph of urine
 mutr ke piech ke 5 se bad kar 8 hone par gurde se nikaas main 10 se 20 guna vruddhi ho jaati he
 In alkalinization of urine this aspect of salicylate exudation is taken advantage of
 yah gyaat he ki aspirin anya aushadhiyon ke saath antarkriya karti he
 For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride increase the narcotic effects of salicylates, and alcohol also increases gastrointestinal bleeding with such drugs
 aspirin rakt main anek dawaaon ko unke bandhak sthanon se visthapit karti he, jinamein madhumeh virdohi dawaaen tolabutamide or chlorpropamide, immunospressent methotroxet, fenitoin, probenacid, valproic acid or sabhi nanstiraodel shothavirohi dawaaen shaamil hai
 Carticosteroids can also reduce aspirin concentrations
 spironolactone kii aushadhik gatividhi ko bhi aspirin lekar kam kiya ja saktaa he or gurdon se srav ke liye aspirin penicillin ji se spardhaa karti he
 Aspirin also hinders the absorption of vitamin C
 pashu aushadhishastra main aspirin kaa prayog, praathmik rup se kutton main dard or jodon ke shoth ke upachaar ke liye kiya jaataa he, haalanki iske liye isaki salaah akasar nahin di jaati he, kyonki in pashuon ke liye kam dushprabhavon vaali nai dawaaen uplabdh hai
 For example, gastrointestinal side effects related to salicylates are particularly common in dogs
 ghodon ko bhi dard se raahat ke liye aspirin di jaati he, haalanki iske thode samay tak hi rahane vaale dardashamak asar ke kaaran aam taur par isaki salaah nahin di jaati he
 Horses are also very sensitive to gastrointestinal side effects
 phir bhi, adhikanshtah laminitis ke maamalon main, skandanvirohi ke rup main iskaa prayog laabhadaayak sabit hua he
 Aspirin should be used in animals only under the supervision of a veterinarian
 aspirin billiyon ko kabhi nahin dena chaiye kyonki unamem glucuronide kanjuget banane kii kshamta nahin hoti, jisase aspirin ke vishakt hone kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Toxicity can be reduced by keeping more time between doses
 aspirin salicylic acid se praapt ek acetile yogic he jo ek safed, crystal jaisaa, halkaa amleey padaarth he jiskaa galnaank 135 °se
 hota he
 Acetyl salicylic acid rapidly decomposes into ammonium acetate or alkali metal solutions of acetates, carbonates, citrates, or hydroxides
 acetile salicylic acid shushk hawa main sthir rahata he, lekin ardrata se sanyog main aane par dhire se caydrlise hokar acetic or salicylic acidon main badal jaataa he
 In solutions with alkalis, hydrolysis occurs rapidly, and the resulting clear solution can be completely acetate and salicylate
 aspirin ke sanshleshan ko estarikaran pratikriya ke choop main vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 a chemical reaction is carried out by adding acetic anhydride, an acidic compound, into salicylic acid, which converts the hydroxyl group of salicylic acid into the acetyl group
 is prakriya se aspirin or acetic acid praapt hote hai jise is pratikriya kaa up-utpaada mana jaataa he
 Small amounts of sulfuric acid are almost always used as catalysts
 yah vidhi aam taur par snaatak shiksha prayogshaalaon main kaam main laai jaati he
 Formulas with a high concentration of aspirin have a vinegar-like odor
 aisa isaliye hota he kyonki aspirin ardra dashaon main hydrlise hokar vighatit ho sakati he, jisase salicylic acid or acetic acid praapt hote hai
 The acidic dissolution constant of acetylsalicylic acid is 3

 bahurupaktaa, yaa kisi padaarth kii ek se adhik crystal rachana banane kii kshamta aushadhik tatwon ke vikaas main mahatvapurn hoti he
 Many medicines are getting controller permission for only one crystal form or polymorphism
 kaaphi samay tak aspirin kii keval ek crystal rachana kii jaankaree thi, haalanki 1960 ke dashak se aise sanket the ki aspirin kaa ek doosraa christelline rup ho saktaa he
 The second crystalline form was discovered in 2005 by Vishweshwar and colleagues, and Bond and others presented fine anatomical details

 The history of Hindi literature written by Acharya Ramchandra Shukla is considered to be the most authentic and systematic history in the written history of Hindi literature so far
 acharya shukla ji ne ise hindi shabdhsagar kii bhoomika ke rup main likhaa tha jise baad main swatantra pustak ke rup main 1929 i0 main prakashit karaayaa gaya
 Shukla ji completed this work of historiography in several stages
 sabase pehle unhone kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay main chaatro ko padhaane hetu sahitya ke itihaas par sankshipt note taiyaar kiya tha
 Shuklji himself has written about this short note, 'in which a crude structure was created to represent the chronology and different branches of composition of the history of Hindi literature by targeting the changing trends of educated people according to the situation
 'isi samay ke aasapaas hindi shabdhsagar kaa kaary purna hua or yah nishchay kiya gaya ki bhoomika ke rup main 'hindi bhashaa kaa vikaas' or 'hindi sahitya kaa vikaas' diya jayega
 Acharya Shukla wrote the development of Hindi literature within a set time
 kahana na hoga ki is kaary main unhone sankshipt note se bharpoor madad lee
 In this way, a raw structure of the history of Hindi literature was ready, but Shukla ji was not completely satisfied with it

 Veterinary linguistics is a practical method of language-teaching that emphasizes on facilitating language by describing the similarities and differences of a language pair
 isiliye ise kabhi-kabhi antaraatmak bhashavigyaan bhi kaha jaataa he
 The emergence of individual linguistics during World War II was aimed at teaching soldiers the languages of the countries where they were going to fight
 bhashavigyaniyon se kaha gaya tha ki ve vahaan kii bhashaaon ko kam se kam samay main seekhney va sikhaane ke liye shikshan-saamagree taiyaar kar uplabdh kar den
 During this period, people speaking languages of many castes in the United States came and settled
 un sab logon ko angreji seekhney or sikhaane kii bhi maang aa gayi thi
 In fulfillment of these two demands, linguists had to study and analyze many different languages as well as build their teaching material
 iske parinamswarup skulon ke paathyakramon kii shikshan-saamagree ko bhi naye sire se nirmit karne kaa vichaar uthaa
 In view of all this, work started to be done on the 'application side of linguistics in linguistics'

 san 1957 main prakashit rabart ledo kii pustak `linguisticks acraasak cultures' vyatireki bhashavigyaan kaa aakaar granth he
 These days, while teaching other languages, linguists realized that the other language learner speaks or writes something that is not in line with the language to be learned
 iske do kaaran ho sakate hai : Either he has learned the rules of that language incorrectly and yaa abhi usne un niyamon par dakshata hasil nahin kii he
 These assumptions gave rise to three ideas-- yadi anya bhashaa shikshan ko sahi disha main or vaigyanik tareekon se sampann karaayaa jaae to seekhney vaala us bhashaa ke niyamon ke anurup bhashaa kaa prayog kar saktaa he
 The errors of learners in other languages indicate that the learner has difficulties in some places
 inhen kathinaaiyon ke sthal yaa samasyamoolak sthal kah sakate hai
 Places of difficulty are often those that are the sites of difference or differences in the learner's mother tongue and the structure of the language taught
 uparyukt vichaaron se vyatireki bhashavigyaan kii sthapanaaon ko bal mila
 Basic foundations of linguistics are: - Explanation of simplicity and difficulty in other language teaching compared to the contrast of the source language and target language of the learner
 anya bhashaa shikshan ke liye sabase adhik prabhavi shikshan-saamagree vah he jo seekhney vaale kii strot bhashaa or lakshya bhashaa kaa samanaantar vaigyanik vyatireki vishleshan tathaa paathyabinduon kaa chayan or anustaran karke taiyaar kii jaati he
 a teacher who has the ability to compare the source language and target of the learner with the scientific method, can better understand the learning problems of the learner and can offer better solution to them
 rabart ledo kii pustak ke prakaashan ke do saal ke baad washington main `centre faar appluid linguisticks aaf da modern lenguez association' kii sthapana kii gayi jisamen angreji ke saath vividh pramukh bhashaaon kii sanrachanaon ke vyatireki vishleshan kii kai `series' nikaali ja rahi he
 Now, apart from America, in the UK and almost all European countries, the study of personality is being presented at many levels
 yahan romania kii pariyojna `romanian-english contreshtu enlysis project' ke aayojakon ne apane jo uddeshy nirdhaarit kiye hai ve drashtavy hai :-- "donon bhashaaon ko dhwani vyavastha, vyakaran, shabdaawalee evam lekhan vyavasthaaon kii tulana prastut karnaa
 The purpose of this comparison is to shed light on the structural similarities and inequalities that exist in both languages that cause psychological confusion in the learner of both languages
 is pariyojna ke nishkarshon ke aadhaar par shikshan-vidhiyon kaa avishkaar or namoonay kii upyogi shikshan-saamagree kaa nirmaan karnaa
 To test the application of these findings in this construction work
 bhavishya main is disha main kaam karne waalon ke liye maargdarshan pradaan karne ke liye yogya saamagree taiyaar karnaa 
" vyatireki bhashavigyaan is kaary main prayatnsheel he ki do bhashaaon kii samakalik sanrachanaon ko is tarah aamane-saamne rakhaa jaae yaa do bhashaaon kii samakalik sanrachanaon kaa is tarah vaishamy prastut kiya jaae ki donon bhashaaon main vidyaman samantaayein or vishamtaayen yaa bhinnataayen spashtat: prakat ho jaaen
 Based on this, the conclusions that will come out can help in estimating the errors that occur while learning the language
 vyatireki vishleshan ke is upaagam ko kaam main laate hue ham is jaankaree se vaaqif ho sakate hai ki amuk bhashaayi prishthbhumi rakhane vaala vyakti kis tarah kii trutiyaan kar saktaa he or un trutiyon ko dur karne yaa kam karne ke sandarbh main kya samaadhaan ho sakate hai
 In this way, testing of theoretically suggested solutions may actually be possible only during classroom teaching
 vastusthiti main ham aksar yah bhi dekhte hai ki ek hi bhashaayi prishthbhumi vaale do chaatro main se ek chaatr ek hi sthal main ek tatva kii jagah kisi ek tatva ko pratisthapit karata he to doosraa chaatr usase bhinn tatva ko
 It is therefore necessary to revise these findings in the classroom
 vyatireki vishleshan ke prastaavak rabart ledo ne apni pustak main thik hi kaha he ki vyatireki vishleshan ke dwaara soochibaddh jo samasyaayen hai ve anumaanit hai
 These certification are done after examination in the context of students' linguistic experiments
 upar hamane dekha he ki vyatireki bhashavigyaan sankar yaa mishra bhashavaigyanik udhyam he jiskaa sambandh bhashavigyaan ke atirikt samaajavigyaan evam manovigyaan se bhi he
 Since contrast analysis is associated with other language learning and linguistics relies on learning processes, linguistics requires psychological basis / or components
 adhigam manovigyaan ke antargat pramukhat: do skool prachaar main hai :-- Behavioral psychology and avyavi yaa sangyanatmak manovigyaan
 In behavioral psychology, learning is related to a combination of two elements: stimulation / arousal and response
 vyavahaaravaadi manovigyaan ke antargat adhigam ke in do tattvon ko tharnadike ne sambhddha siddhant, watasan, powelav aadi ne abhyunukulan siddhant or skinner ne punarbalan siddhant ke pariprekshya main adhyayan prastut kiya
 Psychologists applied it to language learning, elaborating experiments on animals in the context of learning of common, simple and tangible objects, experiences, suffixes and actions
 pariveshgat abhyanukulan se uttejit yaa uddipit hokar vaktaa jo ucchar karata he vah anukriya maani jaaygi
 In other words, the words that a person wishes to express will be referred to as 'U' and allied linguistic signs are called 'A'
 vaktaa kaa `a' shrota
 In the view of linguists, language is a social practice
 yah aadat-niyantrit vyavhaar he jo uddipan or anukriya kii shrinkhalaa kaa pratifalan he
 Language analysis refers to the analysis of the pronunciation of these habit-controlled behaviors
 vyavahaaravaadi manovigyaan ne adhigam ke sambandh main jo sthapanaayen kii hai ve prayogjnya hai or anubhavjanya hai
 Therefore, they are also called experimental or experiential
 inamen siddhant kaa jhukaav anubhavon or prayogon kii vaidhata par nirbhar he
 The linguistic ideology associated with behavioral psychology is called class ideology
 sanrachanaatmak bhashavigyaan isse sambhddha he
 Structural linguists rely on observable linguistic elements to consider empirical testing to be valid
 bhautik tathy yaa satya se viheen koi sanrachana inaki drushti main adhyayan ke liye nirarthak he
 That is why Martin Juss says we have no right to speculate about such inaccessible linguistic units, they are inaccessible
 bhashaa kaa varnan prastut karte samay hamaara dhyaan keval awalokit bhashaayi tathyon par janaa chahie
 This ideology considers the same structure of language: the overhead structure, and not the structure
 yah vichaardhaara bhashaa ko aadat-niyantrit vyavhaar maanati he or uske adhigam ko aadatanirmaan prakriya ke rup main pratipaadit karti he
 Elemental or cognitive psychology represents the theory of insight into learning affixes
 yah adhigam amoort pratyayon se adhik sambandh rakhata he or yah jatil adhigam kehalaata he
 In this learning with a plethora of affective suffixes, the human assimilates the brain by normalizing and differentiating the suffixes / objects with the insight due to their brain surge

 It depicts the biography of Indian emperor Harshavardhana
 aitihaasik kathanak se sambandhit yah sanskrit kaa sabase pracheen granth he
 The cheerful available at this time is divided into eight sorrows
 jisamen se pehle dhai uchhvas baan kii aatmakatha rup main hai
 Then there is a description of the Punyabhuti dynasty of Sthanishwar, in which Harsha's father Prabhakarvardhan was born
 baan ne prabhakarvardhan kii putree rajyashri or kannaujadhipati grahaverma maukhari ke vivaah kaa varnan kiya he
 By sending his eldest son Rajavardhan to kill the Huns, Prabhakarvardhan became feverish
 baan ne uske rog, mrityu, dah-sanskaar evam samragi yashomati ke aatmadah kaa varnan kiya he
 Then, after hearing about the invasion of Kannauj of Gaur and Malava forces and the killing of Graha Varma, Rajyavardhana moved towards Kannauj
 shatruon ne hathiyaar daal die

 rajyavardhan ko shatru shivi main aamantrit kiya gaya or unki nirmam hatya kar di gai
 Harsha vowed to avenge the murder of his brother-in-law and brother and proceeded towards Kannauj
 harsh kii badhati hui sena ke saamne shatru bhaag niklaa
 Hearing this, there was no end to Harsha's astonishment that Rajyashree left from captivity and went towards Vindhyachal
 bahut parishramyukt khoj ke pashchaat harsh ne aatmadah karne ko tatpar rajyashri ko divakar mitra rishi ke ashram ke paas paaya or ganga ke tat par apane shivi main le aayaa
 Here the script ends abruptly
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki baan kaa vichaar harsh ke charitra ko purnroopen likhane kaa nahin tha
 He wanted to write only one part of it because he told his listeners' Harsha's life cannot be described even in hundreds of lives
 yadi aap uskaa ek ansh sunanaa chaahate ho to main taiyaar hoon
 It is also rightly said that 'joyful' is only an incident in Harsha's life because the historical knowledge available from Harsha Charit is very less
 parantu is granth kii samalochna karte hue hamen ise aitihaasik rachana ke rup main nahin dekhnaa chahie
 In fact, it is more appropriate to call it a poem with historical plot

 He has not even given the names of Bhoota Gaur and Malav kings, who represent the masterpiece
 bhoomi ko gaudon se shunya karne ke harsh ke nishchay hone par bhi, baan ne gaudon kii bhavi ghatnaon ko chhod diya he
 Where readers are eager to listen to the result of the discovery of Harsha from Vindhyaparvat, Baan is engaged in making a subtle description of Vindhyaparvata
 astu, baan ne harsh kii prasthaan karti hui sena kaa, rajyasabha kaa, dharmik sampradaayon kaa, graamon kaa sundar chitra prastut kiya he jo ki itihaas kii drushti se bahut mahatvapurn he 1973-11-03 05:45:00 UTC, was an American robotic spacecraft that was launched by NASA on 3 November 1973 to fly through the planets Mercury and Venus

 germany main apane pati ke saath rah rahi subhash kii putree anita bose phalf ko yah vishwaas he ki unke pita kii mrityu taipenh main hi hui thi or rankoji mandir main rakhi asthiyaan unke pita kii hi hai
 On the Mukherjee Commission report, intellectuals argue that Subhash's policy was to befriend the enemy of the enemy

 But some people living in India also believed that Bose disguised in Faizabad as Gumnami Baba lived for a long time and died there

 In Hinduism, when a person dies, after performing the cremation, there is a tradition of immersing his ashes in a holy river or Ganges Sea
 iske saath yah manyata bhi he ki yadi koi hindu kisi aise sthaan par mare jahaan aas paas koi bhartiya nadi na ho to uski asthiyon ko kisi potli main baandhakar yaa to pipal ke vriksh kii kisi shakha par lataka diya jaataa he yaa phir paas ke hi kisi mandir main rakh diya jaataa he
 Then the people of his family flow those ashes into the Ganges or any other holy river as per their convenience
 parantu netaji ke asthi-kalash ke saath aisa bhi nahin hua

 On social media, some intellectuals had suggested that Subhash's ashes kept in the pagoda of Rankoji temple complex should be taken to India from Japan Government and his daughter Anita Faf should be called to India and get the DNA test done
 isse netaji vimaan durghatana main mare athwa nahin mare is vivaad kaa ant ho jaayegaa or hindu parampara ke anusaar pita kii asthiyon ko ganga nadi main visarjeet karne kii unki putree kii ichha bhi puri ho jaayegi

 saath hi sadan se prastaav-sweekrut nishkasana se bhi paatr kii sadsyta samaapt ho jaati he
 After the appointment, the Prime Minister's disqualification, on any of the foregoing qualifications, is proved in a legal court, then the election of that person is declared void, and he is expelled from the post of Prime Minister
 
 pradhanmantri ko pad kii shapath raashtrapati dwaara dilaai jaati he
 For appointment to the post, the prospective officer is required to take two oaths
 ye donon shapath bhartiya samvidhan kii teesri anusuchee main vinirdisht hai, 99, 124, 148, 164, 188 or 219): Types of Pledge or Affirmation: 1 mantripad kii shapath kaa praaroop : 2 Form of Oath of Privacy: saiddhanthik rupatah, padasth pradhanmantri, "raashtrapati ke prasadparyant", apane pad par bana rahata he
 Unlike the President, no time limit has been set for the Prime Minister's term
 atah ek padasth pradhanmantri anishchit kaal tak pradhanmantripad par bana rah saktaa he, basharte ki raashtrapati ko usapar "vishwaas" ho
 The real meaning of this is that a person can hold the post of Prime Minister only as long as the majority in the Lok Sabha is in his favor
 baharhaal, loksabhaa kaa puraa kaarykaal 5 varsh hota he, jiske baad nae chunaav karaaye jate hai, or naveen sabha punah pradhanmantri ke paksh main vishwasamat paarit karti he, yadi nav-nirvaachit sabha pradhanmantri main avishvaas ghoshit kar detii he to phir pradhanmantri kaa kaarykaal samaapt ho jaataa he
 Therefore, it can be said that the Prime Minister has a full term of 5 years, after which he is reviewed again
 baharhaal, pradhanmantri kaa kaarykaal 5 varshon se purv hi samaapt ho saktaa he, yadi kisi karanvash, loksabhaa sarkaar ke virodh main avishvaas mat paarit kare athwa yadi kisi karanvash, pradhanmantri kii sansad kii sadsyta shunaya ghoshit ho jaae to pradhanmantri, kisi bhi samay, apane pad kaa tyaag, raashtrapati ko ek likhit tyaagptr saunp ke kar sakate hai
 Prime Minister Morarji Desai was the first Prime Minister of the country to relinquish his office during his tenure
 pradhanmantri ke kaarykaal par naa hi kisi prakaar kii samay-seemaa he naa koi aayu seemaa nirdisht kii gai he
 India Gateway bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 74 main spasht rup se mantriparishad kii adhyakshata tathaa sanchaalan hetu pradhanmantri kii upasthiti aavashyak maanata he
 In the event of his death or resignation, the entire council has to step down
 vah akele hi mantri parishad kaa gathan karata he
 The President appoints the Minister on his advice only
 mantri gana ke vibhaag kaa nirdhaaran bhi vahi karata he
 The function of the cabinet also does the same
 desh ke prashasan ko nirdesh bhi vahi detaa he
 All policy decisions are taken by him
 raashtrapati tathaa mantri parishad ke madhyasampark sutara bhi vahi he
 He is also the principal spokesman of the Council of Ministers
 vah parishad ke naam se ladi jane vaali sansadeey bahason kaa netritv karata he
 He can participate in any debate being fought in favor of the Council in Parliament
 mantri gana ke madhya samanvay bhi vahi karata he
 He can ask for any information from any ministry
 in sab karnow ke chalate pradhanmantri ko bharat kaa sabase mahatvapurn rajnatik vyaktitv mana jaataa he
 The most important reason for the dominance and importance of the Indian Prime Minister is the executive powers conferred on his office bearers
 samvidhan kaa anuchhed 74 pradhanmantri ke pad ko sthapit karata he, evam yah nirdisht karata he ki ek mantriparishad hogi jiskaa mukhiya pradhanmantri hoga, jo bharat ke raashtrapati ko "salaah or sahaayta" pradaan karenge
 And Article 75 establishes that the appointment of ministers will be done by the President as per the advice of the Prime Minister, and the minister will also be given various assignments as per the advice of the President, Prime Minister
 atah samvidhan yah nirdisht karata he kii, jahaan sanvaidhanik kaaryakari adhikaar bharat ke raashtrapati ke paas he, parantu kyonki in sambandhon main bharat ke raashtrapati keval pradhanmantri kii salaahnusaar kaary karte hai, atah vaastavik rup se, in kaaryakari adhikaron kaa prayog pradhanmantri apni icchaanusaar karte hai
 The constitution establishes by these legislations that as the head of the nation of India, the Prime Minister shall exercise all the executive powers vested indirectly, and will be the head of the entire Council of Ministers and constitution of the Council of Ministers by Article 75, appointment of ministers
 And his assignment has also been left to the will of the Prime Minister, but also the ministers and ministers
 The Constitution, the Prime Minister in relation to schools provides complete freedom
 pradhanmantri, apane mantrimandal main kisi bhi vyakti ko shaamil kar sakate he, nikaal sakate he, niyukt kar sakate hai yaa nilambit karvaa sakate hai
 Since ministers are appointed by the President only on the advice of the Prime Minister, it means that the Council of Ministers is actually created by people of the Prime Minister's choice, in which they can change at any time of their choice
 saath hi mantriyon ko vibhinn kaarybhaar pradaan karnaa bhi purnatah pradhanmantri kii ichha par nirbhar karata he; ve apane mantriyon main se kisi ko bhi koi bhi mantralay yaa kaarybhaar saunp sakati hai, chin sakate hai yaa doosraa koi kaarybhaar / mantralay saunp sakate hai
 In these cases there is no constitutional obligation of any kind to the Prime Minister to consult the ministers concerned, or to obtain their permission
 balki mantriyon va mantralayon ke vishay main purvakthith kisi bhi maamle main sambandhit mantri yaa mantriyon kii salaah yaa anumati praapt karne kii, pradhanmantri par kisi bhi prakaar kii sanvaidhanik baadhyataa nahin he
 They can also ask any minister to resign from the minister any time they want, and if that minister refuses to resign, they can ask the president to suspend him from office
 mantriyon kii niyukti evam mantralayon ke aavnton ke alaava, mantrimandaleey sabhaayen, cabinet kii gatividhiyaan or sarkaar kii nitiyon par bhi pradhanmantri kaa puraa niyantran hota he
 The Prime Minister is the constitutional head and leader of the Council of Ministers
 ve sansad evam anya manchon par mantriparishad kaa pratinidhitiv karte he
 They preside over cabinet meetings, and decide the agenda of these meetings, and other topics of discussion
 balki cabinet baithkon main uthne vaale saare maamle va vishaysoochee, pradhanmantri kii hi sweekruti va sahmati se nirdhaarit kiye jate hai
 It is at the will of the Prime Minister to approve or reject various proposals that arise in cabinet meetings
 haalaanki, charchaa karne or apane nijee suzav va prastaavon ko baithak ke samaksh rakhane kii swatantraaa har mantri ko he, parantu antytah vahi prastaav yaa nirnay liya jaataa he, jisapar pradhanmantri kii sahmati ho or nirnay paarit kiye jane ke pashchaat use puure mantriparishad kaa antim nirnay mana jaataa he, or sabhi mantriyon ko pradhanmantri ke us nirnay ke saath chalanaa hota he
 Therefore, it can be said that as a constitutionally, the Prime Minister has complete control and unchallenged dominance over the Union Cabinet
 niyantran ke maamle main pradhanmantri, mantriparishad kaa sarvesarva hota he, or uske istife se puri sarkaar gir jaati he, arthath saare mantriyon kaa mantritv samaapt ho jaataa he
 Apart from the chairmanship of the Council of Ministers, the Constitution vests another special privilege on the Prime Minister, this privilege being the mid-contact thread between the Council of Ministers and the President
 yah visheshadhikaar keval pradhanmantri ko diya gaya he, jiske madhyam se pradhanmantri samay-samay par, raashtrapati ko mantrisabha main liye jane vaale nirnay or charchaaon se sambandhit jaankaree se raashtrapati ko adhishuchet karaate rahete hai
 No minister other than the Prime Minister can voluntarily reveal to the President any of the subjects discussed in the Council
 yah visheshadhikaar kii mahatv va arth yah he kii mantrimandaleey sabhaaon main charchit vishyon main se kin jaankariyon ko gopneey rakhana he, evam kin jaankariyon ko duniya ke saamne prastut karnaa he, yah tay karne kaa adhikaar bhi pradhanmantri ke paas he
 The Prime Minister works as the Chief Manager of the various organs of the state, whose job is to get all the departments and organs of the state to do the work as they wish
 sarkaar ke vibhinn vibhaagon or mantralayon ke bich samanvay bananaa, or cabinet dwaara liye gaye nirnyon ko karyanvit karwaanaa tathaa vibhinn vibhaagon ko nirdeshit karnaa bhi unka kaam he
 It is also their job to resolve administrative differences between ministries and departments and take final decisions
 sarkari kaaryon ke karyanvayan ke alaava bhi, sarkari tantra par pradhanmantri kaa atyadhik prabhaav or pakad hota he

 These appointments include high-advisors and high officials of government ministries and offices, governors of various states, attorney generals, auditors, overlords of public service commissions, and other members, ambassadors of various countries, consulars, etc

 At the same time it is expected that the Prime Minister will make important bills and announcements taken by the government in the House and the Prime Minister will answer from the ruling side about those important decisions
 loksabhaa adhyaksh kaa chunaav, nirvachan dwaara hota he, atah saadharantah, sabhapati bhi bahumat daal kaa hota he
 Therefore, being the leader of the majority of pulses, through the Speaker, the Prime Minister also has the ability to influence the proceedings of the Lok Sabha in a limited way, as the Chairman is the Speaker of the House, and the Chairman also determines the table of contents in the House
 However, the action of the House cannot be affected to a greater extent
 in kartavyon ke alaava, sansadeey karrwai ko par pradhanmantri kaa sabase mahatvapurn shakti he, loksabhaa satr bulaane or satrant karne kii shakti
 Article 85 of the constitution gives the President of India the right to call and end the session of the Lok Sabha, but in this case the President has to act according to the advice of the Prime Minister
 arthath vaastavikrupe, loksabhaa kaa satr bulaanaa or ant karnaa pradhanmantri ke haathon main hota he
 This right is, undoubtedly, the most important right given in the hands of the Prime Minister, which gives him an opportunity to have limited control not only on his party but also on the activities of the opposition mps
 sarkaar or desh ke netaa hone ke naate, vaishvik manch par bharat kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa pradhanmantri kii sabase mahatvapurn zimmedaariyon main se ek he

 The Ministry of External Affairs of India handles global relations and related matters, for which an independent cabinet minister is also appointed in the name of the foreign minister, but because foreign policies, etc
, the Prime Minister determines, therefore, the Foreign Minister is ultimately decided by the Prime Minister
 Implements the decisions and policies taken
 vibhinn deshon se samrik, aarthik, kootnithik, vanijyik or sansadhanik, ityadi sandhiyaan or samjhaute, tathaa unase judi kootnithik bahes or vaartaon main pradhanmantri kaa kirdaar sabase mahatvapurn hota he, or aisi vaartaon main ve desh kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai

, and stands for India
 antarrashtriya manch par desh kii chhavi banane, or kootnithik vaartaon dwaara desh ke hit kii aapurti karne main pradhanmantri kaa sthaan behad mahatvapurn he
 The Constitution of India, being the head of the national head and all strategic forces, gives the President of India the right to declare war and peace from any other country, but its real authority lies with the Prime Minister, because according to the advice of the Prime Minister in this matter Are bound to work yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke alaava, yuddh kii ranneeti nirdhaarit karnaa tathaa samrik balon ko niyantrit karnaa bhi pradhanmantri dwaara hi hota he tathaa shanti-ghoshnaa karnaa or shanti-samjhauta karnaa bhi pradhanmantri kaa karttavya he

 Due to this emergency, due to the wave of protest against Indira, all the political parties of the opposition unitedly fought against the Congress in the 1977 elections, under the umbrella of the Janata Party, after the conclusion of the Emergency, and Successfully defeated the Congress

 Prime Minister Morarji Desai's government was highly detailed and composed by political parties of many opposing ideologies, which were difficult to unite and maintain consensus and coordination on various political decisions
 antytah dhai varshon ke baad, 28 july 1979 ko morarji ke istife ke saath hi unki sarkaar gir gai
 Thereafter, for a fleeting time, as Deputy Prime Minister in Morarji's government, Chaudhary Charan Singh, with the support of the Congress, proved the majority and took the oath of Prime Minister
 unka kaarykaal keval 5 maheenon tak chalaa
 He too was finding it difficult to coordinate with the constituents, and eventually lost the majority due to withdrawal of Congress support, and he had to resign

 unhone punah nirvachan karavaaya or is baar, congress aitihaasik bahumat praapt kar, vijayi hui
 In the 1984 elections, the Congress easily won 401 seats in the Lok Sabha, which is the highest number of seats received by any party

 in aarthik nitiyon ko, aagaamee sarkaron ne jari rakhaa, or bhartiya arthvyavastha ko vishwa kii sabase gatisheel arthvyavasthaaon main se ek banaaya
 Apart from these economic changes, Narasimha Rao's tenure also saw the demolition of the disputed structure of Ayodhya's Babri masjid-ramjanmabhoomi and the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party as a national level party

 The government of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, elected in 1998, took some very concrete and challenging steps
 may 1998 main sarkaar ke gathan ke ek maheene ke baad, sarkaar ne pokharan main paanch bhutalia parmaanu visphot karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Many Western countries, including the US, imposed economic sanctions on India in protest of these blasts, but due to the support of Russia, France, Gulf countries and some others, this ban of Western countries completely failed

 In February 1999, the two countries signed the Lahore Declaration, declaring both countries to end mutual rivalries, increase trade and use their nuclear capability for peaceful purposes
 17 april 1999 ko jayalalita kii party iedamak ne sarkaar se apana samarthan he diya, or nae chunaavon kii ghoshnaa kerani padi

 Tuman was the first Chanyu of the Shionganu people who had authority over Central Asia and China in ancient times
 uskaa shasankaal 220 isapurv se 209 isapurv anumaanit kiya gaya he
 Historians believe that the name Tumen is derived from the word 'tumen' in the Mongol language, meaning 'ten thousand'
 tuman kaa zikr kuch chini itihaas-granthon main hua he
 It is believed to have been ruler in the region of Inner Mongolia and was subject to the vast Yuzhi people in the region of Gansu and Xinjiang but was attacked by the Chin dynasty of China and driven to the north
 us samay kii pratha ke anusaar usne apane bade putr modu ko ueshi darbar ke paas choda hua tha jis se ukiyon ko vishwaas tha ki tuman un se vafadaari karegaa
 But Tuman was in favor of his younger son and Modu's younger half-brother because he was misled by that son's mother
 modu ne yah baat bhaanp lee
 Tumen suddenly attacked the Yuuzhiis - it is said that he thought they would kill Modu for revenge
 lekin isi bajaae modu himmat se apni jaan bachaakar nikal gaya

 Ammeter or 'ammometer' is a device used to measure the current flowing in a branch of a circuit
 bahut kam maatra vaali dhaaraon ko maapne ke liye prayukt yuktiyonko "milliametre" yaa "micrometre" kehete hai
 The earliest design of Ammeter was the d'arsonle's Dharmapi or the moving horoscope Dharmapi
 san 1820 i
 main ampiore ne avishkaar kiya ki yadi kisi chaalak ko, jisamen vidyutdhara pravaahit ho, chumbakeey kshetra main rakhaa jaae, to usapar ek bal kaary karata he
 The value of this force is equal to the product of the intensity of the magnetic field, the current and the length of the conductor
 is bal kii disha fleming ke baayein haath vaale niyam se gyaat kii jaati he
 Spread the thumb of your left hand, the finger near it and the middle finger of the middle in such a way that all three are perpendicular to each other
 yadi tarjani chumbakeey kshetra kii disha main or madhyamaa vidyutdhara kii disha main sanket karen, to chaalak kii gati anguthe kii disha main hogi
 When electric current flows in a coil placed in a magnetic field, a coaxial force acts on the coil, which it begins to rotate
 is siddhant ko kaam main laakar jo dharamapi banaae gaye, hai unhen chalkundal dharamapi kehete hai
 It consists of a rectangular coil with thin and electrified copper wire
 yah kundali phasphar branj kii bahut patali pattee dwaara ek pench se lataki rahati he, kundali kaa ek sira isi pattee se judaa rahata he or pattee kaa sambandh dharamapi ke e sanyojak pench se hota he
 The leaf also has a circular plane or concave mirror, which rotates along the leaf
 kundali kaa doosraa sira dhaatu kii ek sarpil kamaani se judaa rahata he, jiskaa sambandh duusare sanyojak pench se hota he
 This coil hangs between the poles of a powerful permanent umbilical magnet
 chumbak ke dhruv natodar belanaakaar akruti main kate rahete hai
 a soft iron small cylinder is enclosed in the back of the Dharmapi by a screw inside the coil between the two pole segments
 ye sab vastuen ek achumbakeey baks main band rakhi jaati hai
 Glass is placed in the front of the box, so that the mirror can be measured by deflection lamp and scale method
 jab kundali main vidyut dhara pravaahit hoti he, tab kundali ke do bhujaaon par balyugma kaary karata he or kundali ko uski sthiravastha se ghuma detaa he, jisase phosphor branj kii pattee or neeche kii sarpil kamaani main anthan aa jaati he or e anthan bal yugma kundali par vipareet disha main kaary karne lagata he
 Due to which the horoscope is soon in balance
 yadi kundali kaa vikshep kone tha ho, to dharaman nimna sutara se nikalataa he : That is, the current is proportional to the deflection angle
 ye dharamapi atyant sthaayee or yathesht sugranhak hote hai
 They can measure current up to 10 amperes
 chalkundal dharamapi mukhyatya do prakaar ke hote hai : In this, the coil is wrapped on a metal structure, which causes the coil to deflect quickly as the current flows
 jaise hi kundali gumti he, usamen or uske dhaatu ke dhaanche main bhavar dharaayen utpann hoti hai or kundali ko roak detii hai
 The horoscope does not oscillate, this is why this instrument is called dead-pulse
 dhara ke hatate hi kundali apni purv sthiti main pahunch jaati he
 Therefore, the value of the current can be determined very easily by the knowledge of the position of the coil and the position of the current
 is dharamapi main kundali ek achaalak dhaanche par bandhi rahati he or is kaaran usamen bhavar dhara nahin utpann hoti
 Hence there is very little resistance in the coil deflection
 kundali dhaatu ke dhaanche par aavisht na hone se dhara pravaahit kiye jane par, apni vikshepasthiti ke donon ore dolan karti he
 It is very sensitive and we can determine the transient charge before it is very accessible
 ye do prakaar ke hote hai : aakarshanwale tathaa pratikarshanwale
 If current flows through a stationary coil of insulating wires, a magnetic field is produced in and around the coil
 is kundali ke paas yadi kachche lohe kaa ek tukdaa lataka diya jaae, to vah kundali kii ore aakarshith ho jaataa he
 If this iron piece is fitted with an indicator, the indicator will also be deflected
 yadi koi aisi vyavastha ho ki lohe ke tukade par jo aakarshan bal he uske vipareet bal lagaakar use santulan main laayaa ja sake, to dhara kaa maan sanketak ke vikshep se pataa chal sakegaa
 Often this attraction is opposed by a spiral spring
 aakarshan bal dhara-maan ke varg ke samaanupati hota he
 Therefore the deflection of the indicator will also be proportional to the square of the current value
 isi kaaran yah prayavarti dhara kaa maan bhi gyaat kar saktaa he
 Between the stationary coils of several wheels of insulating wires, two soft iron thin rods are parallel to the axis of the coil
 ek chad to sthir rahata he, doosraa ek sanketak se judaa he jo swayan ek keel par laga he
 The other end of the indicator rotates on a dial
 jab kundali main dhara pravaahat hoti he, tab donon chad ek hi prakaar ke prerit chumbak ho jate hai
 According to magnetic laws they have repulsion and the iron attached to the indicator rotates, causing a deflection in the indicator
 isamen bhi vikshepanakon dharaman ke varg kaa samaanupati hota he
 These instruments are very simple and cheap
 jab naapane main bahut yatharthata kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti or anek pusht yantron kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, tab isi siddhant par bane ameter or voltmapi prayog main laae jate hai
 In power houses, soft iron devices are mostly used on switchboards
 prerit chumbak main aakarshan yaa pratikarshan dharapravaah kii disha par nirbhar nahin hota
 The force is proportional to the square of the torrent
 is kaaran dhara pravaah kii disha kuch bhi ho, bal kii disha ek hi hoti he
 For these reasons, these instruments are used to measure both direct current or reverse current
 kundali ke prerakatv ke kaaran ye ucch aavriti kii prayavartin dhara ke maapnkaarya main nahin prayukt kiye ja sakate
 This type of ammeter depends on the thermal effect of the current
 jab dhara kisi chaalak se pravaahit hoti he, tab vah chaalak tapt ho jaataa he
 The value of the generated heat is proportional to 2 x
 yadi dhara ampiore main or pratirodh om main ho, to The value of heat is proportional to the square of the current, that is, it is not dependent on the direction of current
 isliye aise emeter dishtdhaara athwa prayavarti dhara donon hi ke naapane ke prayog main laae ja sakate hai
 This effect has been used in two ways in the measurement method: pehle prakaar kaa yantra sabase pehle 1883 main major kardyu ne banaaya tha
 hartmann-bron improved it
 taar main dhara bahati he or tapt hone ke kaaran usamen prasar hota he

 It is the third largest planet in the solar system by diameter and the fourth largest planet by mass
 dravyaman main yah prithvi se 14

 On average, it is much less dense than the Earth - because stones and other heavy materials are in greater percentage on Earth, while Arun has more gas
 isiilie prithvi se tiresth guna bada akar rakhane ke baad bhi yah prithvi se keval saadhe chaudaa guna baari he
 Although Arun can also be seen with the eye without binoculars, it is so far away and appears to have so much light that ancient scholars never gave it the status of a planet and considered it a distant flickering star

 In 1845, Urbann Le Verrier began his independent research on the orbit of Uranus
 On 23 September 1846 Johann Gottfried Galle discovered a new planet, later renamed Neptune, close to the position predicted by Le Verriere

 Uranus has an axial inclination of 97
77 degrees, so its rotation is roughly parallel with the axis of the solar system

 Yet Uranus is hotter at its equator than at its poles
 iske liye uttaradaayi antarnihit tantra agyaat he
 The reason for Uranus' unusual axle tilt is also not known with certainty, but as usual speculation is that during the solar system formation, an Earth-sized tributary collided with Uranus and caused this asymmetric orientation
 At the time of Voyager 2's passing in 1986, the south pole of Uranus was almost directly towards the Sun
 grah ke ghurnan kii disha ke maujuud hone ke baavjood, "dakshin" ke rup main pahchaan ke liye iskaa dhruv haal ke antarrashtriya khagoleey sangh dwaara samarthit paribhaasha kaa upyog karata he

 The standard model of the Uranus structure is that the planet is composed of three layers: a rocky core in the center, an icy mantle in the middle, and an outer gaseous rind
 The core is relatively small with an Earth mass of 0
55 and a radius less than the 20% radius of Uranus, the mantle incorporates a large amount of planets with 13
4 Earth masses, while the upper atmosphere is comparatively unrealistic with a weight of 0
5 Earth mass
 And extend at a 20% radius of the last edge of Uranus

 is taral padaarth ke paas ek ucch vidyut chaalakata he, jise kabhi kabhi ek taral-ammonia sagar kehalaata he
 Most structures of Uranus and Neptune are very different from those of Jupiter and Saturn, with gases dominating ice, so their distinct classification as ice demons is upheld

 For example, convection can take place in a group of structurally dissimilar layers, which can impede upward heat transport, making it possible that dual diffusive convection may be a limiting factor

 Voyager's observations showed that Uranus' magnetic field is distinct for two reasons, one because it does not originate from the geometric center of the planet and another because it is tilted at 59 ° from the rotational axis
 vastav main yah chumbakeey dwidhruv grah ke centre se dakshin ghurni dhruv kii ore grahiy vyas ke adhiktam ek tihaai jitna khisak gaya he
 This unexpected geometrical result in the high asymmetric magnetosphere, where the strength of the magnetic field on the surface of the southern hemisphere may be the lowest 0

 The Indian numeral system is the most popular numeral system in the world
 france ke prasiddh ganitagya piyare simon laplas ke anusaar, Devanagari and international forms of Indian numerals are shown below- itihaaskaaron ke anusaar isa purv chauthi shatabdi main bharat main brahmi ankon kaa prachlan tha
 Brahmi numerals have been found in inscriptions found in caves in the Pune and Mumbai regions and in ancient coins found in Uttar Pradesh
 brahmi ankon main dashamalav pranali tathaa shunya kaa prayog nahin hota tha
 According to apocalyptic documents, zero in India, which is the basis of the decimal system, was invented in the first century CE
 kintu bharat main shunya ke avishkaar ke pramanik dastauez paanchavi shatabdi main hi mili hai
 The inscriptions found in Gwalior, dating back to 870 CE, contain signs of zero
 is shilaalekh ko sabhi itihaaskaaron ne ek mat se manyata di he
 With the invention of zero, the practice of the ten digit number system started in India which became the basis of modern number systems prevalent in this world
 isvi san ke saatvin shatabdi main arab ne bhartiya ank pranali kaa abhigrahan kar liya
 Indian numerals in Arabia became known as Gubar numerals and Indian numeral system known as Hindusa numeral system
 hindustan se is ank pranali ke praapt hone ke kaaran hi vahaan ise 'hindusa' naam diya gaya
 According to the chronological account of a scholar named Muhammad ibn Musa al-khwarizmi of Arabia, europe main barahavin shatabdi tak roman ankon kaa prayog hota tha
 The Roman numeral system has only seven digits, expressed by letters
 ye aksharank hai- I, V, X, L, C, d tathaa m 
 Any number is written by subtracting the sum of these digits
 udhaaharan ke liye agar teen likhnaa he to ek kaa chinh teen baar likh diya III
 If eight is to be written, three to the right of five are added by writing the signs of each one and it becomes VIII
 yah pranali itani kathin or uljhi hui he ki jab barahavin shatabdi main europe kaa bhartiya ank pranali se parichay hua to usne use sweekaar hi nahin kiya, apitu ekadam apana liya
 The scientific-industrial revolution that took place in Europe after a few centuries, has contributed to the calculation of Indian numerals
 bharat ne gananaa hetu nau ankon tathaa shunya kaa avishkaar kiya tha
 Not only this, the local value of numbers was also invented in India
 shunya kaa koi maan nahin he kintu use agar ek ank ke dahini ore likh diya jaae to vah das ingit karegaa kyonki ab 1 kaa sthaneey maan das ho gaya
 If one more zero is increased to the right, this number will be hundred
 is tarah ank ke dahini ore likhe jane par moolyaheen shunya, duusare ankon kaa mulya badha detaa he
 In short, the principle of pricing digits by place is called local value
 is pranali se kisi bhi sankhya ko likhnaa bahut aasaan he
 The three hundred forty-four which we write in the Roman system as CCC XL IV, can be written 344 by Indian law
 is madhyam se badi se badi sankhya bina kisi kathinaayee ke sankshep main likhi ja sakati he
 Indian mathematics also invented the decimal system
 bharat main dashamalav ankon kaa sarvapratham prayog aryabhatta pratham dwaara miltaa he
 It is possible that it was invented much earlier
 kint europe main dashamalav ank kaa saamaanya prachaar satrahavin shatabdi main hua, jiskaa gyaan nishchit hi usne bharat se praapt kiya tha
 These Indian mathematical principles were acquired through Europe to Arabia
 arabi bhashaa main in ankon ko hindasa kehete hai
 Hindsa means 'derived from Hind'
 arabi lipi daaen se baayen likhi jaati he, kintu arabi main ank baayen se daayen likhe jate hai
 This is also evidence that Arabic numerals did not originate in the Arab country with the Arabic language, but are imported from outside
 arabon ke madhyam se jab yah bhartiya ank europe pahunche to unh laga ki ye ank mul rup se arabon dwaara hi avishkaar kiye gaye hai
 Therefore, even today, in Europe, the Indian numerals from one to nine and zero are called 'arabic Numericals'

 There was no progress in knowledge science

 But with the establishment of Islam, the Arab Empire expanded to the borders of Spain and North Africa in the west and India in the east
 jo desh parajeet hokar arab samrajya main shaamil hue, unke aarthik prashasan ke liye arabi gananaa-pranali, jo ki atyant praarambhik str kii thi, aparyaapt siddh hui
 Therefore, the Arab rulers were forced to use the numbers of the conquered castes

 The respect that Arab people had for Indian knowledge, science and art at that time, is written in al-zahij's booklet - Fakir assam-sudan al-lah binad: pisa nagar ke leonado ne, jisane kisi moore se hindu ganit siikhaa or san 1202 main liber evaiki naamak pustak likhi, jiskaa sanshodhit sanskaran san 1228 main aayaa
 In this, he explained Hindu numerals and their utility
 alekjad r de viladi or jaan aak heliphaks kii pustakon ne bhi ‘hindu ank pranali’ kaa prasar kiya
 Initially it was opposed, but by the middle of the fifteenth century it was accepted by all the countries of Europe
 anya european deshon ne bhartiya ank pranali ko arab se siikhaa
 Since they got this numeral system from Arabia, they named it 'arabic numeral system'
 itihaas kaa sahi gyaan hone ke baad ab ise 'hindu-arabic ank' yaa 'hindu ankapranali' yaa 'bhartiya ankapranali' kaha jane laga he
 There have been many changes in the sign of the Indian numeral system from time to time and country to country
