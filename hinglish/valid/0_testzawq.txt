 The reason for this difference is that in both the cycles, the month of approximation should be kept at different place
 Additionally, without any calendar changes, the frequency of monthly difference between the two festivals will increase gradually as the difference between the underlying solar years will also increase: the Hebrew calendar's mean mean solar year is 365
2468 days while the Grigorian calendar's 365
2425 Of the day
 In the years 2200–2299, for example, in 4 out of 19 years, Pascha Grigorian would begin one month after Easter
 kyonki aadhunik hebrew calendar main nisaan 15 kabhi somvaar, buudhvaar, yaa shuukravaar ko nahin pad saktaa atah nisaan 15 kaa seder bhi kabhi punya brihaspativaar kii raat ko nahin pad saktaa
 doosraa seder jo kuch yahudee samudaayon main paska kii duusari raat manaaya jaataa he wo brihaspativaar kii raat pad saktaa he
 Because the underlying solar year of the Julian calendar has moved more with the passing centuries than the Grigorian and Hebrew calendars, five of the nineteen years since Julian Easter fall only after Grigorian Easter, the years respectively — 3, 8,11 , 14 and 19
 This means that two of the nineteen years occur only after the Pascha of the Jews, which are the years 8 and 19 in the Christian cycle
 iske alaava, kyonki julian calendar kii chandra aayu ausat chandra maas se 4 se 5 din peeche he, julian easter hameshaa paska kii shuruyaat ke baad padataa he
 The consequent effect of this mistake in the Solar Year and the lunar month of the Julian calendar promotes the many-times but false belief that Easter must always be followed by the Jewish Paschas
 1923 main istanbul main, patriark melatius chaturth kii adhyakshata main purvi roodhiwaadee bishps kaa ek sarvyaapee-roodhiwaadee samaaj mila, jahaan par bishope julian calendar ko sanshodhit karne kii baat se sahamat hue
 is calendar kaa mul swaroop easter kaa nirdhaaran jerushlem ke madhyahn par aadhaarit sateek khagoleey gananaa ke aadhaar par kar saktaa he
 However, all Orthodox Eastern countries who later adopted the revised Julian calendar adopted only the portion of the revised calendar where festivals in the Julian calendar were falling on fixed dates

 Some priests of various faiths advanced the opinion of completely disobeying the position of the moon in determining the date of Easter
 The proposal included that Easter should always be celebrated on the second Sunday of April or Prabhu Prakash and that there would always be seven Sundays between Wednesday when the head was consumed by Christians as a symbol of immortality and repentance
 Even following this belief, Easter date could have been given on the same result with Easter on April 7 only
 in sujhaavon ko zyada samarthan praapt nahin hua or bhavishya main bhi inke apanaae jane kii khaas sambhaavna nahin dikhti

 While the legislation has not been implemented, the Act still exists in the statute book and can be enforced if various Christian churches allow this

 In Eastern Christianity, the spiritual preparation of Pascha begins with a great fast that begins on a pure Monday and lasts for the next 40 days
 The last week of the Great Roza is called the date of the date and ends with Lazarus Saturday
 sandhya vandana jo laazarus shanivaar ko shuru hoti he usee ke saath mahaan roze kaa aadhikarik taur par ant hota he, jabaki vrath aane vaale saptaah ke dauraan bhi jari rahata he

 Pascha-thematic festivities begin as early as midnight, including Paschal-themed midnight worship, Paschai clock, and Paschal-themed divine worship
 Positioning the Paschal-themed divine worship at midnight ensures that no divine worship will take place in the early morning, that is, the time is fixed for the most prestigious "celebration of festivities" in the worship year
 paska se sarv santon ke ravivaar tak kaa aradhana kaal panchashati ke naam se janaa jaataa he

 This puja is known as sunrise worship and often occurs in the outer area of the church, such as an outer cemetery, courtyard, or nearby park

 puure angreji bhashi duniya ke kshetra main easter ek hi tareeke se manaaya jaataa he or iske manaaye jane ke tareeke main bahut maamuli antar paaya jaataa he
 For example, traditionally on Saturday, Easter eggs are spent decorating and Sunday mornings are spent with the children in search of them because by then they are mysteriously hidden in the house and garden
 anya paramparaon main shaamil hai mata pita kaa apane bacchon ko ye bataanaa ki andey or khaane ke duusare saamaan jaise ki chocolate eigs or khargosh or marshmelo chiks aadi easter bani dwaara easter daliya yaa basket main bheje gaye hai or jab bachche so kar uthte hai to unhen ye daliya milti he

 Other religious churches, such as Lutheran, Methodist, and Anglican, continued to follow the tradition of fully observing the entire Church year
 In Lutheran Church, not only were all the days of the Holy Week celebrated, but Christmas, Easter and Pentecost were also celebrated as three days of festivities, including those days as well as the two days that followed
 In other religious reform traditions, things were slightly different
 in chhuttiyon antat behaal ho gayin 
 kuch isai nahin manaate kyonki unka vishwaas he ki ye atal rup se murtipuja or vidharmee butaparasti se jude hue hai
 Their disapproval for these traditions is partly based on their own interpretation of 2 Corinthians 6: 14–16
 iske atirikt, kuch isai jo is avasar kaa jashn manaate hai wo ise "mritotthana ravivaar" kahana pasand karte hai yaa "mritotthana diwas", taaki dharmik utsav ko dharmanirpeksh or easter bani jaise vyavsaayik pahaluon se alag kar ke dekha ja sake
 This is also the view of Jehovah's Witnesses who perform the annual worship at the Mathematical Hour on the basis of the lunar Hebrew calendar commemorating the death of Jesus on the Last Supper or Last Supper and then Nisan 14 that evening
 yah aamtaur gavaahon dwaara sankshep main or saadhaaran rup main " da memorial yani yaadgaar" kaha jaataa he
 Jehovah's Witnesses believe that verses such as Luke 22: 19-20 and 1 Cor 11:26 together indicate a command to remember Jesus' death and do so yearly in the same way as the Jewish annual
 As Paska considers
 mitron ke dharmik samaaj ke sadsy paaramparik taur se easter nahin manaate, unka vishwaas he ki " har din ishwar kaa he" or kisi ek din ko dusre dinon se zyada mahatva dena ye dikhaata he ki ham dusre dinon main gaiyr isai kaary karnaa sweekaarya hoga- unka maananaa he ki har din pavitra he or use aise hi jiya janaa chahie

 Some groups believe that Easter is a festival that is associated with immense happiness: one who more than meets the joy of the day in whose memory this day is celebrated — that is, the miracle of Jesus' resurrection
 In this spirit, the lesson of these Christians is that every day and all Sabbaths should be kept holy according to the lesson of Jesus
 Hebrew Christians, Holy Names and Armstrong Movement Churches generally do not accept Easter and favor Nissan 14 and Christian Paschal compliance
 ye visheshkar un isai samoohon ke liye sach he jo saat dinon ke sabbath ke saath hi nav chandramaa or vaarshik ucch sabbath ko bhi maanate hai
 This point has also been supported in writing by the Colossians: "do not give anyone the right to make a decision about what you eat and drink 


 and the celebration of Nav Chandra and Sabbath
" Is a shadow of things; reality is related to Jesus
 " Critics allege that the system of sacrifice written at the end of the Old Testament and 70 B
C
 In the light of the demolished second temple, such festivals and feasts are meaningless
 television aadi madhyamon se isai dharm kaa prachaar karne vaale laire hach or kai kalvari chapel girijaghar hebrew-isai tareeke apana chuke he, lekin easter ko phir bhi nahin maanate
 Other Seventh-day Sabbatarian groups, such as the Curses of God or the Church of God, celebrate a Christian Pascha that does not have the methods and symbols associated with Western Easter and features many of the Paschas celebrated by Christ in The Last Supper or the Last Supper
 Huh
 aadhunik sanyukt rajya america main, aisi ghatnaayen hui hai jahaan easter or good friday ko janata ke bich vyanjanapurna shabdaawalee ke saath ullikhit kiya gaya he
 Examples include calling "good Friday" in the students' calendar a "spring holiday" so that this day is not associated with a Christian holiday, as well as a day-long state-approved day off
 
 In the United Kingdom, where Good Friday and Easter Monday are still national holidays, many secular events are held during these holidays, but many associated annual events, including the religious meaning behind these days, are not held

 gibs ne schuli shiksha saint joseph marist college se or phir rondebosh main diossan college se praapt kii
 gibs skool main ek pratibhashali khiladi the, jinhone SA skool tiimon main, prantiy rugby, cricket or footbal, sabhi tino khelon main hissaa liya
 Due to his ability to drop stumps, he is considered by some to be the second Jonty Rhodes at the backward point, as well as a report made by Cricinfo in late 2005, showing that the 1999 Cricket World Cup has been one since He is ranked eighth in all-day international cricket in impacting the most run outs by any fielder, as well as the tenth highest success rate
 Su also
 gibs ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki vah shaayad hi kisi match se pehle, net par abhyaas karte hai
 He is said to like to play his natural game in this matter
 gibs ko 1999 ke vishwa cap ke dauraan, australia ke steve wa kaa ek apekshaakrit aasaan kaich chhodane ke liye yaad kiya jaataa he
 He became the first player to score six sixes in an over in one-day international cricket, which he made against the Netherlands in the 2007 Cricket World Cup
 On 8 June 2007, she married Tennielle Pavé in St
 Kitts, but they were soon divorced
 gibs ne apane test kariyar main do dohare shatak banaae he, jo donon hi tulanaatmak pariyan thi
 His first innings in 1999, against New Zealand, was 211 not out at z Stadium
 unki yah pari 468 gendon main puri hui, jabaki unka doosraa doharaa shatak, pakistan ke khilaaf 228 ran, keval 240 gendon main bana
 newlands main kheli gai, is pari main vah grem smith ke saath 368 ranon kii rashtriya record saajhedaari tak pahunche
 He then scored 300 runs at the start of the innings with his captain twice, making it the only pair in the history of Test cricket to have scored 300 runs three times
 unhone jaik kallis ke saath dusre wicket kii saajhedaari main 315* ranon ke saath dakshin africa duusare wicket kaa record bhi banaaya he
 The incident is famous for Gibbs giving up an important catch in the game against Australia during the 1999 World Cup, when he happily tried to throw the ball into the air before he could fully control it
 The player whose catch he dropped was Steve Waugh, who went on to score a century in that match and lead Australia to victory
 The win provided the necessary momentum to the Australian team, which went on to win the tournament
 yah daawa kiya gaya, ke us vakht jaise hi kaich chuta, wa ne gibs se kaha tha kii, "tumse vishwa cap chhot gaya" lekin apni aatmakatha "out of maai comphort zone ", main wa isse inkaar karte hai
 Waugh, however, definitely said that fellow player Shane Warne had tried it out that Gibbs had a habit of immaturely tossing the ball into the air, and instructed his teammates that he would crease Do not leave early if Gibbs is caught by him, as the situation may be similar to what happened to Waugh
 gibs un teen ballebaajon main se ek hai, jinhone ek divasiy cricket itihaas main lagaataar teen pariyon main 100 ran banaae hai
 Others are Saeed Anwar and Zaheer Abbas
 3 oktober 2002, ko potchefstroom main unke 153 ran, jo puri team ke ek saath milakar banaae gaye, aath wicket par kul 301 ranon se bhi zyada the, jis main bangladeshiyon kii nirnaayak haar hui thi
 On October 6, Gibbs got the chance to become the only batsman to score a century in 4 consecutive matches in the second ODI of that series
 South Africa needed 155 runs to win and Gibbs were just three runs short of scoring a century, scoring an unbeaten 97
 When he needed just six runs to win, he was batting on 96 runs, but Alok Kapali bowled a leg-side ball that got four runs and made it almost impossible for Gibbs to score a century
 12 march 2006 main gibs ne australia ke khilaaf paanchaven ODI main sirf 111 gendon par 175 ranon kii vishaal pari kheli, jisane dakshin africa ko jeet dilaai
 boeta dipenar ke 1, nethan braken dwaara out kiye jane ke baad gibs ne grem smith se saath ballebaaji kii
 yah itihaas kaa sabase adhik score khadaa kiye jane vaala ek divasiy antarrashtriya match tha or unki pari ne kai ballebaaji ke record tod die

 sirf 79 gendon par sau ran banane ke alaava, unhone australia ke khilaaf ek divasiy antarrashtriya khel main us vakht kaa sabase tej shatak banaaya
 sabase ahm baat yah thi, ki kisi bhi virdohi team ke khilaaf dakshin africa ballebaaj dwaara banaaya gaya yah sabase tej shatak tha, haalanki usee varsh baad main yah record mark bauchar ne tod diya
 iske alaava, yah kisi bhi dakshin africa ballebaaj kaa ab tak kaa sabase adhik score tha
 He scored 126 runs at the boundaries, more than any batsman so far

 ravi shastri or sar garfield sobers ne pehle yah uplabdhi first-class cricket varg main hasil kii he, lekin test cricket main aaj tak kisi bhi khilaadi ne yah lakshya praapt nahin kiya he
 On doing so, he raised US $ 1 million for "habitat for Humanity Housing" projects, which was part of a competition run by tournament sponsor Jonnie Walker
 sambhaavna he ki unka saint kits or nevis kii naagarikta se sammanit kiya janaa is kaaryvash hua

 On 22 April 2006, Gibbs was paid for his recent poor performance and was not included in the second and third Test matches against the New Zealand cricket team
 He lacked confidence in Test cricket and scored only 2 and 6 runs in the first Test at Centurion Park
 South Africa's chief selector, Aaron Lorgat, said, "we have held a meeting and it has been agreed that a break and a fresh start in the next session will bring them considerable profit
 This was widely seen as a harsh decision
" vah team main waapas madhya kram main aae, lekin unka ranon ke liye sangharsh jari rahaa
 janvari 2007 ko, pakistan ke khilaaf pehle test ke nishkarsh par unhen bina shatak banaae 2 saal se zyada ho gaye
 He was going to come out of this position on several occasions, but was dismissed four times near ninety

 In 2003, Hayes recommended Gibbs as Sean Pollock's successor in captaincy, but now, from this, "his batting average over this period is 25
25, more than 10 runs at an average of 35
87
 is down
 " hes ne mahasoos kiya ke "gibs ateet ke karnamo se dur ho rahe hai or rashtriya sthaan par bane rahane ke liye aavashyak form main nahin khel rahe hai
 However, he said, Gibbs is the only South African player to have scored more than 1,000 runs in the World Cup and out of the remaining twelve, only Sachin Tendulkar is better than him with 57
93 and Sir Vivian Richards averaging 63
31

 Unlike RPC web services, loose coupling is more likely, as the focus is on the "contract" provided by WSDL rather than on the underlying implementation details

 The focus here is on interaction with a stateful resource rather than messages or campaigns
 The rest-based structure can use WSDL to describe SOAP messages over HTTP, which can be applied to SOAP purely as an abbreviation

 She does It has been a matter of discussion that this can hamper the brittleness of the system, as a small change on the server can result in different wsdls and different service interfaces
 Client-side classes that can be generated from WSDL and XSD service descriptions are often associated with a particular version of the SOAP endpoint and can break through endpoint changes or client-side SOAP stack improvements
 a well-designed SOAP endpoint does not suffer from this, but still the problem is that every service's custom interface requires a custom client for each service
 web sevaaon main XML ke sandesh swaroop main or SOAP evam HTTP ke gher or parivahan main upyog ke kaaran web sevaaon ke pradarshan ke bare main chintaa jataai jaati he, lekin ubhartee XML parsing / indexing technologys, jaise kii VTD-XML, XML sambandhit pradarshan muddon par dhyaan rakhane kaa bharosa detii hai| Problems to be addressed with web services can be solved in other ways, both preceding and contemporary measures exist

 For example, the dialing code for Guam is +1 followed by the area code 671 - not +671 or +1671
 Originally larger countries, such as France, were assigned two-digit codes and small countries, such as Iceland, were assigned three-digit codes; however since the 1980s all new assignments have been three-digit regardless of countries’ sizes
 CCITT, the predecessor of the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector, developed the first formal list of telephone country codes
 This list was included in the 1964 CCITT Blue Book, among other international telecommunication recommendations, which would eventually become ITU-T recommendation E
164
 An earlier system of country codes for European use was mentioned in the 1960 CCITT Red Book
 Some of these country codes were retained in the CCITT country code assignments and remain in effect

 hyperthyroidism yaa atigalagranthita vah shabd he jiskaa prayog galagranthi ke bheetar ke atisakriy utakon ke liye kiya jaataa he jisaki vajah se galagranthi hormone kaa aavashyaktaa se adhik utpaadan hone lagata he
 In this way, hyperthyroidism is a cause of thyrotoxicosis, ie the clinical condition of increased thyroid hormone in the blood
 yah gaur karne laayak baat he ki atigalagranthita or thyrotoxicosis samanarthak nahin hai
 For example, thyrotoxicosis may be due to ingestion of its exogenous thyroid hormone or inflammation of the thyroid gland, due to which it begins to secrete its thyroid hormone stores
 The thyroid hormone is important at the cellular level, affecting almost every type of tissue in the body
 jab avatu granthi bahut adhik maatra main hormone banane lagata he to sharir, urja kaa upyog maatra se adhik karne lagata he
 This is called hyper thyroidism or hyperactivity of the intact girth

 yadi avatugranthi sahi tareeke se kaam kare to santoshjanak dar par sharir ke upaapachay ke kaary ke liye aavashyak hormone kii sahi maatra bani rahegi
 As the hormone continues to be used, the thyroid continues to replace it
 avatugranthi, rakt kii dhara main hormone kii maatra ko pituitary granthi ko sanchalit karke niyantrit karata he
 When the pituitary gland, located in the middle of the skull under the brain, detects that the thyroid hormone is deficient or in excess, it adjusts its hormones and tells the thyroid what to do

 avatugranthi jivan bhar rahata he
 With its careful management, people suffering from thyroid gland can live their life in a healthy and normal manner
 atigalagranthita ke kai kaaran hote hai
 Mostly, the entire gland over-produces thyroid hormone
 ise grevs rog kaha jaataa he
 Generally, in rare cases, a single gland is responsible for excess hormone secretion, which is called the "hot" gland
 thyroditis bhi atigalagranthita paidaa kar sakati he
 In many clinical conditions, excess thyroid hormone is produced by the functioning thyroid tissue
 manushyon main iske pramukh kaaran nimnlikhit hai: High blood levels of thyroid hormones can occur for many other reasons: rakt main shlashmik granthi dwaara utpaadit thyroid-uttejan hormone )) ke str ko maapna vishisht rup se sandigdh atigalagranthita kaa praarambhik pareekshan he
 a low level of TSH typically indicates that the mucosa is obstructed or "directed" by the brain to cut stimulation of the thyroid gland, leading to increased levels of T4 and / or T3 in the blood
 It seems to happen
 kabhi-kabhaar hi, ek nimna ti shlashmik kii praathmik vifaltaa, yaa anya beemaari ke kaaran shlashmik ke asthaayee avarodhan ko ingit karata he or isliye T4 or T3 kii jaanch tab bhi naidanik rup se upyogi he
 Measuring specific anti-thyroid-peroxidases such as anti-tsh-receptor antibodies in Graves' disease or per-thyroid-peroxidase in Hashimoto's thyroiditis may also contribute to the diagnosis
 rakt pareekshanon se atigalagranthita ke nidaan kii pushti hoti he, jo thyroid uttejan hormone str main kami or T4 tathaa T3 staron main vruddhi darshata he
 TSH is a hormone made by the mucous gland in the brain, which tells the thyroid gland how much hormone to make
 jab thyroid hormone bahut adhik hota he, tab ti kam ho jaataa he
 Both radioactive iodine ingestion tests and thyroid scans characterize the cause of hyperthyroidism or enable radiologists and doctors to determine the cause of hyperthyroidism
 thyroid granthi dwaara avashoshit iodine kii maatra ko maapne ke liye udgrahan pareekshan ke dauraan khaali pet radiodharmee iodine injection kaa upyog kiya jaataa he yaa munh ke dwaara sharir main daalaa jaataa he
 People suffering from hyperthyroidism consume too much iodine
 udgrahan pareekshan ke silsile main vishisht rup se sanchalit thyroid scan chhaviyaan prastut karata he, jisase granthi kii ati-kriyasheeltaa kii drishy jaanch ho paati he
 Thyroid scintigraphy is a useful test for characterization of this disease resulting from hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis
 yah pareekshan pranali main vishisht rup se ek duusare se jude do pareekshan shaamil hai: ek iodine udgrahan pareekshan or ek gamma camere ke saath ek scan 
 udgrahan pareekshan main radiodharmee iodine kii ek khuraaq, vishisht rup se iodine-123 yaa 123I, ko prabhaav main laana shaamil he, jo thyroid rog ke naidanik adhyayan ke liye iodine kaa sabase upyukt samasthanik he
 I-123 is almost the ideal isotopic of iodine to produce images of thyroid tissue and thyroid cancer mutation

 Some patients may experience mild allergic reaction to clinical radioiodine and may be given antihistamines
 rogi aamtaur par 24 ghante baad radioiodine "udgrahan" kaa str waapas praapt kar letaa he, ise gale main bandhi ek dhaatu shalaka se jude upkaran se mapa jaataa he, jo thyroid se radiodharmita utsarjan ko maapta he
 This test takes 4 minutes, as long as the leverage by machine software is stored
 vishisht rup se, ek scan bhi kiya jaataa he, jahaan gamma camera se visham thyroid granthi kii chhaviyaan lee jaati hai; radiologist uskaa adhyayan karata he or chhaviyon kii jaanch karne ke baad udgrahan % kaa ullekh karte hue ek report taiyaar karata he or apni tippanee detaa he
 Hyperthyroid patients typically "ingest" a higher-than-normal level of radioiodine
 RAI udgrahan kaa saamaanya seemaa 10-30% se hai
 In addition to testing TSH levels, many doctors also test T3, Free T3, T4 and / or Free T4 for more detailed results
 in hormonon ke liye vishisht vayask simaaen hai: ti : 0
45 - 4
50 uiu / emel, T4 free / pratyaksh : 0

 atigalagranthita se grast vyakti aasaani se kai baar T4 or / yaa T3 kii in upree simaaon ko pradarshit kar sakate hai
 See the complete table of common range limits of thyroid function in the thyroid gland article
 hyperthirodism ke kaaran nimnlikhit hai- Large and commonly accepted modalities for the treatment of hyperthyroidism in humans include the initial temporary use of suppressive thyrostatics treatment and possibly later permanent surgery or radioisotopic therapy
 sakriy thyroid kaary ke tahat sabhi raste kaaran ho sakate hai, jinhen aasaani se levothairoxin anupuran se sambhala ja saktaa he
 Thyrosthetics drugs inhibit the production of thyroid hormones, such as carbimazole and methimazole and propylthurasil
 Thyrostatics is believed to inhibit the iodization of thyroglobulin by thyroperoxidase and thereby inhibit the formation of tetra-iodothyronine
 thyroid granthi ke baahar bhi propylathuresil kaam karata he, sakriy rup T3 main T4 ke roopantaran ko roktaa he
 Since thyroid tissue usually contains a large accumulation of thyroid hormones, it takes several weeks for thyrostatics to take effect and the dose often needs to be titrated over a period of months, as well as regular doctor care
 And blood tests have to be done to check the results
 praarambhik upachaar main praayah ek bahut hi ucch khuraaq kii jarurat hoti he, lekin agar lagaataar ek ucch khuraaq kaa istemaal kiya jaataa rahe to rogiyon main avatu-alpakriyata ke lakshan viksit ho sakate hai
 This titer of dose is difficult to perform correctly, and is why the "barrier and substitution" method is sometimes adopted
 baadha va pratisthaapan upachaar main thyroid hormone ko puri tarah se band karne ke liye paryaapt maatra main thyrostetics liye jate hai, marij kaa ilaaj is tarah kiya jaataa he jaise ki use puri avatu-alpakriyata he
 Many of the common symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as palpitations, tremors, and anxiety, are mediated by an increase in beta adrenergic receptors on cell surfaces
 vishisht rup se ucch rakt chaap ke ilaaj main istemaal kiye jane vaale beta blowers is prakaar kii dawa he jo is prabhaav ko pratisantulit kar detii he, dhakdhaki ke samvedan se judi teevr dhadkan ko kam karti he or kampan tathaa vyagrata main kami laati he
 Thus, patients suffering from hyperthyroidism can often get immediate temporary relief, as long as the radioiodine test described above characterizes the hyperthyroidism and then more permanent treatment can begin
 dhyaan den ki ye dawaaen atigalagranthita yaa ilaaj nahin karaane kii vajah se iske dirghakaalik prabhaavon kaa koi ilaaj nahin karatin, balki ye keval sthiti ke lakshanon kaa ilaaj karti hai yaa unhen kam karti he
 Some minimal effects on thyroid hormone production, however, also come from propranolol — which has two roles in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, which is determined by the different isopropyl substances of propranolol
 el-propranolol beta-avarodhan kaa kaaran he, isliye kampan, dhakdhaki, vyagrata or garmi asahansheeltaa jaise atigalagranthita ke saath jude lakshanon kaa upachaar karata he
 D-propranolol inhibits thyroxine deiodinase, thus providing some, albeit minimal, effects by blocking the conversion of T4 into T3
 anya beta blowers kaa istemaal keval atigalagranthita ke saath jude lakshanon ke ilaaj ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Propanolol in the US and metoprolol in the UK are often used to enhance the treatment of hyperthyroid patients
 aakraamak radio samasthanik chikitsa ke kam upyog ke liye samay se pehle surgery ek vikalp he, lekin aise maamalon main tab bhi isaki jarurat padati he, jinamein thyroid granthi badi ho gayi ho or gardan kii banaavat par dabaav kaa kaaran ho, yaa atigalagranthita kaa aadharbhoot kaaran multah cancer-sambandhi ho
 Surgery is not widely used, as the most common forms of hyperthyroidism are most effectively treated by the radioactive iodine method, and as the removal of the parathyroid glands and cutting of the recurrent laryngeal nerve makes it difficult to swallow and cause a large Surgery may even lead to generalized staphylococcal infections
 kuch grevs rog ke marij, tathaapi, is yaa us kaaran se dawaaon ko bardaasht kar sakate hai, ve rogi jinhen iodine se allergy he, yaa jo rogi radioiodine se inkaar karte hai, ve shalya chikitsa kaa vikalp chun sakate hai
 In addition, some surgeons believe that radioiodine treatment is unsafe for patients with abnormally large glands, or whose eyes are out of the cotter; There are fears that too high a dose of radioiodine 131 may increase the patient's symptoms
 iodine-131 radio samasthanik chikitsa main, ati sakriy thyroid granthi ke kaary ko sakhti ke saath rokane yaa ekadam se nasht karne ke liye ek baar ke liye radiodharmee iodine-131 munh ke jariye diya jaataa he 
 apadan kaarak upachaar ke liye is radiodharmee iodine ke samasthanik kaa prayog naidanik radioiodine kii tulana main adhik shaktishaalee hota he, jiskaa jaivik arddh jivan 8-13 ghante hota he
 Iodine-131, which also eliminates beta particles that are far more harmful to tissues in a limited area, has a half-life of about 8 days
 jin rogiyon par pehali khuraaq kaa asar nahin hota, kabhi-kabhi unhen radio iodine kii atirikt, badi khuraaq di jaati he
 In this treatment, iodine-131 is taken up by the active cells in the thyroid and destroys them, making the thyroid gland mostly or completely inactive
 chunki thyroid koshikaon dwaara iodine ko badi saralata se uthaa liya jaataa he or ati-sakriy thyroid koshikaon dwaara or bhi adhik saralata se uthaaya jaataa he, so vinaash sthaneey str par hota he or is chikitsa ke vyapak dushprabhav nahin hote hai
 Radioiodine ablation has been in use for 50 years and the only major reason for not using it is pregnancy and breastfeeding
 Once the thyroid gland is made dormant, replacement hormone therapy can be easily given through the mouth daily to meet the body's requirement of thyroid hormone
 haalanki, ek visham adhyayan kii tippanee he ki atigalagranthita ke liye radioiodine ilaaj ke baad cancer kii ghatnaon main vruddhi dekhi gayi
 The major benefit of radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism is that it has a much higher success rate than drug therapy
 radioiodine kii khuraaq ke chayan or ilaaj kiye ja rahe rog par nirbhar, atigalagranthita ke nishchit samaadhaan kii safalataa dar 75-100% par bhinn ho sakati he
 One major potential side effect of radioiodine in Graves' patients is the development of subcutaneous hyperactivity, which requires daily thyroid hormone treatment
 kabhi-kabhi, kuch rogiyon ko ek se adhik radiodharmee upachaar kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he, yah rog ke prakaar, thyroid ke aakaar or di gayi praarambhik prashasit khuraaq par nirbhar he
 Many patients are saddened at first that they have to take thyroid hormone pill throughout their life
 Nevertheless, thyroid hormones are safe, cheap, and easy to swallow; And hormones are similar to the thyroid and are usually made by the thyroid itself; Generally, this therapy is extremely safe and very tolerable for most patients
 radiodharmee iodine upachaar ke parinamswaroop thyroid utak ke vinaash se, aksar kai dinon se lekar saptahon tak kii ek chalyman avadhi aati he jab radiodharmee iodine upachaar ke baad atigalagranthita ke lakshan vastav main or bighad sakate hai
 This is usually due to the release of thyroid hormone into the blood after radioactive iodine-generated destruction of thyroid cells containing thyroid hormones
 kuch rogiyon main, beta blowers jaise aushadhi upachaar is avadhi main upyogi ho sakate hai
 Many patients are able to tolerate the first few weeks without any problems

 The "abominable Snowman" title was not coined until 1921, the same year Lt
 Col
 Charles howard-bury led the joint "everest Reconnaissance Expedition" of the Alpine Club and Royal Geographical Society, which he wrote in Mount Everest the Reconnaissance, 1921
 In this book, howard-bury includes a description of crossing the "lhaqupa-la" at 21,000 feet where he found a footprint that he felt was "probably the footprint of a larger-than-tall dagger-hunted wolf who It took the form of a double footprint in soft snow, which seemed to have footprints of some barefooted man "
 They also say that their Sherpa pioneers immediately told them that the footprint would definitely belong to a "wild man of snow" that they named "metoh-kangmi"

 Another proof of "metch" as a misnomer is given by Professor David Snelgrove, a Tibetan-language professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, who rejected the term "metch" as an impossible word because " tch "consonant characters cannot be added together in the Tibetan language

 An early record of the reported footprints appeared in Lawrence Waddell's Among the Himalayas in 1889
 Waddell reported the description of a giant apes-like creature leaving a trail given by his pioneer, which Waddell deemed a bear's footprint
 Waddell had heard stories of creatures with two-legged apes, but wrote that none of the many witnesses questioned "could ever give a single authentic account
 In the most extreme investigations, there is always something a similar solution would have come about that someone had heard about
 " The frequency of news increased during the 20th century when Westerners began to try hard to cover many mountains about it and periodically reported sightings of strange creatures or strange footprints
