 This island of Sri Lanka has been a center of Buddhist scholarship and learning since the introduction of Buddhism in the third century BCE in the production of eminent scholars and preservation of the principles of the vast Pali
 apane itihaas main sinhalai raajaaon ne dweep ke buddha sansthaaon ke rakrakhaav or punarutthan main ek pramukh bhoomika nibhaai he
 During the 19th century, Buddhist education and learning was promoted but it took place in a modern Buddhist revival island
 srilanka main 6,000 buddha mathon main lagbhag 15,000 bhikshu evam bhikshuniyaan hai
 According to traditional Sri Lankan chronicles such as the Dipavamsa, Buddhism was introduced into Sri Lanka in the third century BCE after the Third Buddhist Council by Mahinda Bhikkhu, son of Emperor Ashoka, during the reign of Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura
 During this time, a sapling of the Bodhi Tree was brought to Sri Lanka and the first monasteries and Buddhist monuments were established
 Among these, the Isurumuniya and the Vessagiri remain important centers of worship
 He is also credited with the construction of the Pathamaka cetiya, the Jambukola vihāra and the Hatthālhaka vihāra and the refectory
 The Pali Canon, having previously been preserved as an oral tradition, was first committed to writing in Sri Lanka around 30 BCE
 Mahavamsa §29 records that during the rule of the greco-bactrian King Menander I, a Yona head monk named Mahadharmaraksita led 30,000 Buddhist monks from "the Greek city of Alasandra" north of modern Kabul, Afghanistan) to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the Ruwanwelisaya in Anuradhapura, indicating that greco-buddhism contributed to early Sri Lankan Buddhism
 See also the Milinda Panha
 As a result of the work of Buddhaghosa and other compilers such as Dhammapala, Sri Lanka developed a strong tradition of written textual transmission of the Pali Canon
 The compilation of the Atthakatha along with the Nikāyas and other Pitakas were committed to writing for the first time in the Aluvihare Rock Temple during the first century BCE
 Buddhist literature in Sinhalese also thrived and by 410, Sri Lankan monks discussed widely throughout India and Asia introducing their works
 Over much of the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, three subdivisions of Theravāda existed in Sri Lanka, consisting of the monks of the three mahaviharas, Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya, Abhayagiri vihāra and Jetavanaramaya
 The Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya was the first tradition to be established while Abhayagiri vihāra and Jetavanaramaya were established by monks who had broken away from the Maha Viharaya tradition
 According to A
K
 Warder, the Indian Mahīśāsaka established itself in Sri Lanka alongside the Theravadas, into which they were later absorbed
 Northern regions of Sri Lanka also seem to have been ceded to sects from India at certain times
 In the 7th century, Xuanzang wrote of two major divisions of Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka, referring to the Abhayagiri tradition as the "mahayana Sthaviras," and the Mahāvihāra tradition as the "hinayana Sthaviras
" Abhayagiri appears to have been a center for Mahayana and Vajrayana teachings; Xuanzang writes, "the Mahāvihāravāsins reject the Mahāyāna and practice the Hīnayāna, while the Abhayagirivihāravāsins study both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna teachings and propagate the Tripiṭaka
 In the 8th century, both Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism were being practiced in Sri Lanka, and two Indian monks responsible for propagating Vajrayana Buddhism in China, Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra, visited the island during this time
 In Pali commentaries, terms used for the Mahayanins of Abhayagiri were Vaitulya, Vaipulya and Vaidalya
 According to HR Perera, the Theravada commentaries considered them heretical and their doctrines included: In the 5th century, Faxian visited Sri Lanka and lived there for two years with the monks
 Faxian obtained a Sanskrit copy of the Vinaya of the Mahīśāsaka at the Abhayagiri vihāra c
 406
 The Mahīśāsaka Vinaya was then translated into Chinese in 434 by Buddhajiva and Zhu Daosheng
 This translation of the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya remains extant in the Chinese Buddhist canon as Taishō Tripiṭaka 1421
 The 7th century pilgrim Xuanzang first learned for several years at Nalanda and then intended to go to Sri Lanka to seek out further instruction
 However, after meeting Sri Lankan monks in the Chola capital who were refugees, he decided not to visit: From the 5th century to the eleventh century, the island of Sri Lanka saw continuous warfare between local kings, pretenders and foreign invaders such as the South Indian Chola and Pandyan dynasties
 This warfare saw the sacking of viharas and made the situation for difficult for Buddhism
 In 1070, Vijayabahu i of Polonnaruwa conquered the island and set about repairing the monasteries
 The state of Sri Lankan Buddhism was so bad at this time that he could not find five bhikkhus in the whole island to ordain more monks and restore the monastic tradition; therefore, he sent an embassy to Burma, which sent back several eminent elders with Buddhist texts
 The king oversaw the ordination of thousands of monks
 The royal reforming of Sri Lankan Buddhism continued under Parakramabahu I, who restored many stupas and monasteries
 During this period, Sri Lankan Buddhist literature thrived once again and the three greats writers Mahākassapa Thera of Dimbulagala Raja Maha Vihara, Moggallana Thera and Sāriputta Thera compiled Pali commentaries and sub-commentaries
 Parakramabahu II of Dambadeniya was a learned king and wrote several Sinhalese Buddhist texts
 Before the 12th century, more rulers of Sri Lanka gave support and patronage to the Abhayagiris, and travelers such as Faxian saw the Abhayagiris as the main Buddhist tradition in Sri Lanka
 The trend of Abhayagiri being the dominant sect changed in the 12th century, when the Maha Viharaya gained the political support of Parakramabahu I, who completely abolished the Abhayagiri and Jetavanaya traditions
 The monks of these two traditions were then defrocked and given the choice of either returning to the laity permanently or involving reordination under the Maha Viharaya tradition as sāmaṇeras
 Parakkamabāhu also appointed a saṅgharāja "king of the Sangha," a monk who would preside over the Sangha and its ordinations in Sri Lanka with the assistance of two deputies
 Veneration of Avalokiteśvara has continued to the present day in Sri Lanka, where he is called Nātha
 In more recent times, some western-educated Theravādins have attempted to identify Nātha with Maitreya
 However, traditions and basic iconography, including an image of Amitābha on his crown, identify Nātha as Avalokiteśvara
 Early reports by Europeans from the 18th century describe the Buddhist monks of Sri Lanka as being engaged in the recitation of mantras and using Buddhist prayer beads for counting as practiced in Mahayana Buddhism
 Sri Lanka has the longest continuous history of Buddhism of any Buddhist nation, with the Sangha having existed in a largely unbroken lineage since its introduction in the 3rd century BCE
 During periods of decline, the Sri Lankan monastic lineage was revived through contact with Burma and Thailand
 From the 16th century onward, missionaries and Portuguese, Dutch and British colonizers of Sri Lanka have attempted to convert the local population to Christianity
 The wars with the Portuguese and their allies weakened the Sangha
 In 1592, Vimaladharmasuriya i of Kandy sought aid from Burma in order to ordain Buddhist monks on the island as there was hardly a single properly ordained monk left
 From 1612 to 1658, the Dutch and the Portuguese fought over the island with the Sinhalese caught in the middle, the Dutch won and occupied the maritime sections of the island that had been occupied by the Portuguese until 1796 when they surrendered their territories to the British 
 The Dutch were less zealous than the Portuguese in their religious proselytizing, though they are still discriminated against Buddhists which were not allowed to register with the local authorities therefore many Sinhalese pretended to be Protestant
 During this period many religiously inclined Sinhalese rulers of the interior such as Vira Narendra Sinha of Kandy and Sri Vijaya Rajasinha of Kandy continued to patronize Buddhism, restoring temples and monasteries
 In the mid 18th century the higher ordination of Buddhist monks known as upasampada, which was defunct at the time, was revived with the help of Thai Buddhist monks on the initiatives taken by Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero during the reign of king Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe
 In 1813 the American Ceylon Mission was established in Jaffna
 In 1815 a British army captured Kandy and deposed the Sinhalese king ending a line of Buddhist kings lasting 2301 years, they retained Sri Lanka until 1948
 Like the Dutch, the British refused to register unbaptized infants and to accept non-christian marriages
 They also always preferred Christians in government administration
 The British also supported various Christian missionary groups who established schools on the island
 Education in these schools were a requirement for government office
 Missionaries also wrote tracts in Sinhalese attacking Buddhism and Promoting Christianity In the 19th century, a national Buddhist movement began as a response to Christian proselytizing, and was empowered by the results of the Panadura debate between Christian priests and Buddhist monks such as Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera and Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera which was widely seen as a victory for the Buddhists
 In 1880 Henry Steel Olcott arrived in Sri Lanka with Madame Blavatsky of the Theosophical Society; he had been inspired when he read about the Panadura debate and after learning about Buddhism converted to the religion
 Olcott and the Sinhalese Buddhist leaders established the Buddhist Theosophical Society in 1880, with the goal of establishing Buddhist schools 
 The society also had its own publications to promote Buddhism; the Sinhalese newspaper, Sarasavisandarasa, and its English counterpart, The Buddhist
 As a result of their efforts, Vesak became a public holiday, Buddhist registrars of marriage were allowed, and interest in Buddhism increased
 Another important figure in the revival is Anagarika Dharmapala, initially an interpreter for Olcott, who traveled around the island preaching and writing
 After traveling to India, he established the Maha Bodhi Society in 1891 whose goal was to revive Buddhism in India, and restore the ancient Buddhist shrines at Bodh Gaya, Sarnath and Kushinara
 His efforts saw the restoration of these sites and a renewal of interest in Buddhism among some Indians
 The associations of the Buddhist revival also contributed much to the publication of Buddhist texts, and promotion of Buddhist scholarship
 Revivalist Buddhist scholars include Sir D
 B
 Jayatillake, F
 R
 Somnayake, Valisinha Harishchandra and W
 A
 de Silva
 Several Buddhist shrines were also rebuilt
 Buddhist leaders were also active in the movement for Sri Lankan independence
 Since independence, Buddhism has continued to thrive on the island
 Since the Buddhist revival Sri Lanka has also been an important center of Western Buddhist scholarship
 One of the first western bhikkhus, Nyanatiloka Mahathera studied in Sri Lanka, established the Island Hermitage there and ordained several western monks
 Western monks who studied in the island hermitage such as Nanamoli Bhikkhu and Ven
 Nyanaponika were responsible for many important translations of the Pali Canon and other texts on Buddhism in English and German
 a few years after the arrival of Mahinda, Bhikkhuni Sanghamitta, who is also believed to be the daughter of Emperor Ashoka, came to Sri Lanka
 She started the first nun's order in Sri Lanka, but this order of nuns died out in Sri Lanka in the 11th century
 Many women have been ordained in Sri Lanka since 1996
 In 1996 through the efforts of Sakyadhita, an International Buddhist Women Association, Theravada bhikkhuni order was revived, when 11 Sri Lankan women received full ordination in Sarnath, India, in a procedure conducted by Ven 
 Dodangoda Revata Mahāthera and the late Ven
 Mapalagama Vipulasāra Mahāthera of the Mahābodhi Society in India with assistance from monks and nuns of Korean Chogyo order
 Some bhikkhuni ordinations were carried out with the assistance of nuns from the East Asian tradition; others were carried out by the Theravada monk's Order alone
 Since 2005, many ordination ceremonies for women have been organized by the head of the Dambulla chapter of the Siyam Nikaya in Sri Lanka
 The different sects of the Sri Lankan Buddhist clergy are referred to as Nikayas, and three main Nikayas are: Within these three main divisions there are numerous other divisions, some of which are caste based
 There are no doctrinal differences among any of them
 Buddhism in Sri Lanka is predominantly practised by the Sinhalese, however the 2012 Sri Lanka Census revealed a Buddhist population of 22,254, including eleven monks, amongst the Sri Lankan Tamil population, accounting to roughly 1% of all Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka
 In 1988 almost 93% of the Sinhalese speaking population in Sri Lanka were Buddhist
 Buddhism in Sri Lanka is predominantly followed by Sinhalese people, although the 2012 census of Sri Lanka revealed a Buddhist population of 22,254, revealing for about 1% of all Sri Lankan Tamils, among the Sri Lankan Tamil population, including eleven monks

 Freud has mental elements that do not come into consciousness or come into consciousness in the state of hypnosis or consciousness

 These are usually not able to be fulfilled in a person's daily life and they appear in a distorted form, either in the form of dreams or in the form of hysterical seizures
 frid ke anusaar vyaktitv kaa gatyaatmak paksh teen avasthaaon dwaara nirmit hota he - Idi originates with the birth of a human being
 frid ise vyaktitv kaa sabase mahatvapurn hissaa maanata tha
 Its contents are desires that are related to libido and seek immediate satisfaction
 urja kii vruddhi idan nahin sahan kar paata or agar ise sahi dhang se abhivyakti nahi milti tab yah vikrut swarup dhaaran karke vyakti ko prabhavit karata he
 For Freud, self-consciousness was like what he called a secondary regulator of human behavior

 Para ego is a type of behavior model from which ethical behaviors are employed

 Freud's personality ideas are also called the theory of psychological development
 ise frid ne 5 avasthaaon main baanta he - Based on these, he conceptualized the controversial Electra and Oedipus Complex, according to which the sexual power of the infant is initially effective for itself, gradually being oriented towards other people
 isi kaaran putr mata kii ore tathaa putree pita kii ore adhik aakarshith hote hai
 This leads to a love for the mother and rivalry for the father in boys, which Freud named Oedipus Complex
 yah bahut vivaadaaspad or charchit avadharana rahi he
 Freud could not provide figures to prove the truth of these concepts
 He was criticized by critics for mixing his experiences with these observations and blindly believing what his patients said
 frid par yah bhi aarope lage ki vah manovigyaan main zarurat se adhik kalpanashiltaa or mithkeey granthon kaa ghalmail kar rahe hai, yon aavashyaktaaon ko zarurat se adhik sthaan de rahe hai
 Looking at Freud's work and his beliefs based on them, we find that Freud exerted more on human bestial tendencies
 unhone yah spasht kiya ki nimnatar pashuon ke bahut saare gun or visheshtaayen manushyon main bhi dikhaai detii hai
 The concept of basic tendency as defined by him also comes under this
 frid kaa yah mat tha ki vayask vyakti ke swabhaav main kisi prakaar kaa parivartan nahin laayaa ja saktaa kyonki uske vyaktitv kii neenv bachapan main hi pad jaati he, jise kisi bhi tareeke se badla nahi ja saktaa
 haalaanki baad ke shodhon se yah sabit ho chukaa he ki manushya multah bhavishya unmukh hota he
 Like an academic psychologist, Freud's psychology does not see serialization, but he gave psychology a new definition, on the basis of which we find modern psychoanalytic psychology to stand and, despite all the criticisms, Freud's contribution to abnormal psychology and clinical psychology is not ignored

 Shukraniti is a well-known ethics
 isaki rachana karne vaale shukr kaa naam mahabharat main 'shukracharya' ke rup main miltaa he
 Nothing is known about the creator of Shukraniti and his period
 shukraniti main 2000 shloke hai jo iske chauthe adhyay main ullikhit he
 It is also written in it that the king who thinks day and night of this policy is able to carry his kingdom
 isamen kaha gaya he ki teenon lokon main shukraniti ke samaan duusari koi niti nahin he or vyavhaari logon ke liye shukr kii hi niti he, shesh sab 'kuniti' he
 The content of sukraniti is different from that of spiritual policy
 iske chaar adhyyon main se pratham adhyay main raja, uske mahatv or kartavya, saamaajik vyavastha, mantri or yuvaraj sambandhi vishyon kaa vivechan kiya gaya he
 Shukraniti occupies an important place in ancient Indian political thinking
 shukraniti ke rachayita shukracharya kaa naam pracheen bhartiya chintan main sammanit sthaan rakhata he
 In Dandi's 'daskumarcharitam', Shukracharya has been given the first place in the names of political scribes
 shukraniti itnaa prrachin granth hote hue bhi isamen aise anek vishyon kaa vivaran he jo aaj bhi prasangik hai or upyogi bhi he
 Knowledge of the glorious and rich tradition of Shukraniti contemplation
 kautilya ke ‘arthshaastra‘ evam maikiyavali ke ‘da prince‘ ke samaan shukr kii shukraniti main bhi raja ko shashan karnaa sikhaaya gaya he
 Thus, in this the practical side but not the theoretical aspect of politics is more important
 shukr ke anusaar, ‘‘sabhi ashankaon ko tyagkar raja ko aisi niti kaa paalan karnaa chahie jisase shatru ko maaraa ja sake arthath vijay praapt ho‘‘
 According to Shukracharya, he has presented to his disciples the essence of the ethics of Brahma
 shukr niti me chaar mul adhyay he
 In its various editions, the fifth chapter is in the form of 'khil Niti' which is not a part of the original text
 shukracharya ke kaal kaa nirdhaaran atyant kathin kaary he
 Based on its theme and style, it seems to be a post-kautilya work of Arthashastra
 aisa lagata he ki shukr naam vastutah chintan kii ek vishesh parampara ko vyakt karata he, ek vyakti ko nahin
 It is considered as an authentic text as a source of Indian political thought
 yadhyapi shukranitisar ke rachanakaal ke vishay main vidwaanon main matbhed he, kintu praayah sabhi aadhunik vidwaan is par sahamat hai ki yah vedikkaleen rachana nahin he apitu isa ke baad kii kriti he
 According to Kashiprasad Jaiswal, it is an 8th century creation
 iske granthkaar ko isi kaal kaa rajshastri kaha ja saktaa he
 Shukrniti is a book of political nature, basically similar to Kautilya's Arthashastra, in which Venus has accepted four branches of knowledge like the Kautilya and Kamandaka - angikshika, trilogy, dialogue and chastisement
 shukraniti ke tikaakar, bi0ke0 sarkaar ke anusaar, ‘‘dandniti shashan karne tathaa nirdesh dene se sambandhit vidya he
 "it is fair to say that the importance of punishment and policy that Venus has given in various contexts is the importance of politics, ie politics
 dand niti yaa nitishastra ke alaava jitne shaastra hai, ve sampoorn maanav vyavhaar ke simit bhaag se hi sambandhit hote hai, kintu nitishastra sampoorn maanav vyavhaar se sambandhit shaastra he
 Only with the help of this scripture does the king succeed in fulfilling his basic obligations, but the king who abandons the policy and behaves well, suffers and his servants also suffer
 shyaamalaal pande ne shukraniti saar kaa mahatv bataate hue kaha he ki yah pracheen bharat kii dand pradhan vichaardhaara par aadhaarit ekmaatr uplabdh granth he
 According to Shukracharya, ethics can be considered the main reason for religion, meaning, work and the element that ensures salvation
 shukraniti main raajnneetik chintan ke samast mahatvapurn pakshon - darshanik, avadharanatmak, sanrachanaatmak, prakriyaatmak ko paryaapt mahatv ke saath chitrit kiya gaya he
 The subjects of the state, the control of the state, etc
, along with the theoretical aspects, such as punishment and judicial process, administration of the state, security and war of the state, inter-state relations, etc
, such topics which are related to the practical aspects of the state, have been elaborated
 shukraniti main rajya kii utpatti ke siddhanth kaa vistrut vivechan nahin kiya gaya he
 There is only one verse in the entire book which can be considered to be related to the origin of the kingdom
 shukraniti ke pratham adhyay main kaha gaya he, ‘‘praja se apana vaarshik kar vetan ke rup main sweekaar karne se swami ke rup main sthit raja ko brahma ne praja ke paalnarth sevak banaaya he’’
 Thus, where Brahma, by stating the origin of the kingdom, has supported the divine principle of origin of the kingdom, by emphasizing the responsibility of obeying the king as a public servant and has not accepted any kind of divine authority
 shukr ne rajya ko ek anivaary evam swaabhaavik sanstha sweekaar kiya he kyonki is sansar ke abhyuday kaa aadhaar rajya he
 Just as the moon is the reason for the rise of the sea, similarly the state is the root of the rise of the people
 rajya hi nyaay dwaara dharm, arth, kaam kii siddhi karaata he
 Just as the boat is destroyed in the absence of the seafarer, similarly in the absence of the leadership of the king, the people are likely to be destroyed
 shukr ne rajya ko praja kii bhautik suraksha ke liye hi nahin, varan naitik utthan ke liai bhi uttaradaayi mana he
 In ancient Indian thought, the state is defined as the Weekend State, Venus is also no exception
 rajya saat ango se bana saavyavi he, yah swami, amaatya, mitra, kosh, raashtra, durg, sena se bana he
 "these seven constructive elements of the state have swami head, amatya eye, friend karna, kosh mukha, army mana, fort arms and nation legs," says Shukraniti
 ’’ ek anya prasang main rajya kii tulana vriksh se karte huai raja ko is vriksh kaa mul, mantriyon ko skandh, senapati ko shakha, sena ko pallav, praja ko dhul, bhoomi se praapt hone vaale karkon ko fal evam rajya kii bhoomi ko beej kaha gaya hai
 It is noteworthy that while modern political thinkers consider 4 constructive elements of the state - population, land, government and sovereignty, Venus considers 7 constructive elements
 shukraniti main rajya va raashtra ke madhya antar ko spasht karte huai kaha gaya he ki kisi vishisht raashtra par samprabhu kaa niyantran use rajya kaa rup pradaan kar detaa he
 In this way, Shukraniti makes the difference between state and nation as clear as modern political thinkers
 shukraniti main rajya ke kaary kshetra ko atyant vyapak bataaya gaya he
 Venus has mentioned 8 major areas of state duties- rajya ke dayitvon kii is suchi se yah spasht he ki shukr ne rajya ke vistrut kaaryakshetra kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 It has also made it clear that the state should also acquire the necessary means to fulfill its obligations
 shukr ne rajya ke kaaryakshetra main nimnlikhit pramukh kaary sammilit kiye hai :- According to Venus, the fund has fundamental importance for the defense and prosperity of the army and the nation
 kintu raja ko kosh kaa anyaaypurvak sangrah nahin karnaa chahie
 If the king collects more money from the people to fight the crisis, then at the end of the crisis, the subjects should return the money with interest
 shukr ne rajpad ko kendriya mahatv pradaan kiya he, raja kaa pramukh kartavya praja-ranjan he
 Without the king, the subjects are destroyed, just as the boat without the boat is destroyed
 jaisaa ki ullekh kiya gaya he shukr ne raja ko aath devataaon ke ansh se nirmit bataaya he
 Venus is an Indian thinker who has opposed the notion of the king being the direct god
 shukr ne na to raja ko ‘dev‘ sweekaar kiya he or na hi uske daivi adhikaar maane he, parantu uske dayitvon kii divyata kaa spashtikaran avashya hi kiya hen
 Due to the divinity of obligations, even the ruler himself cannot be free from these obligations by his own will
 rajdharm kaa paalan karne se kshudra raja bhi shrenshth ban jaataa he, jabaki iske vipareet aacharan karne se uttam raja bhi kshudra ban jaataa he
 Venus has also given importance to the moral basis in the classification that the king's income should be without suffering for the people and this is only the classification related to the monarchy
 shukr ne yah pratipaadit kiya he ki shashan kaa uttaradhikari rajkul main se hi liya janaa chahie, kintu raja ke jyeshtha putr ko swatah hi shashan kaa uttaradhikari nahin maan lenaa chahie
 It is good to determine the question of succession only when the king is alive
 anek vyaktiyon ke sthaan par ek vyakti ko hi uttaradhikari nishchit karnaa chahie
 Venus has strongly denied the idea of dividing the state to solve the question of succession because the division is expected to be destroyed by the enemy
 uttaradhikaar ke daavedaaron main aise matbhed bhi ho sakate hai jo rajya evam rajkul ke liai vinaash kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 Therefore, a life of royal honor and respect should be arranged for all of them, so that they can remain satisfied
 shukraniti main shaasha ko vyapak shaktiyaan pradaan kii gai he, parantu shaasha se inkaa prayog vidhi evam dharm ke anusaar karne kii apeksha kii gai he
 Venus has suggested three measures to prevent kings from becoming autocratic and arbitrary - shukr ne shaasha se paramparaon, pratishthit saamaajik mulyon aadi kaa niyantran maanane kii apeksha kii he
 The moral measures suggested by Shukraniti Saar can include the teachings of the king, the teachings of policy and philosophy, the parables presented by the king's assistants and advisors, the system of parochial pleasures and sorrows, the king's various duties, the king's routine, etc
 prashasnic kshetra main shashan kii prakrutiyon kaa uchit paraamarsh raja ko nitibhrasht hone se bachaane ke liye aavashyak mana gaya he
 Venus has propounded the need for the ruler's loyalty to the consultants of ministers etc
 for the smooth functioning of the kingdom, as well as requiring the officials appointed to consult him to always give proper advice to the king
 yahan tak ki apatkaal main bhi raja ko swatantra nahin mana he
 He is able to take drastic decisions only with the consent of the parties concerned
 nyaayayik kshetra main udaseenta ke vyavhaar ko shaasha ke ghor naitik aparaadh kii sangya di he, tathaa chetavanee di he ki aisa karne par vah narak main jayega
 For the decisions of judicial lawsuits, there is a definite and fair procedure to be followed by the king
 shukr ne nyaay sabha ke sadasyon kii yogyata va nyaay sadhano kaa vistrut vivaran diya he
 It is clear from the above description that Venus has considered the opposition of the king to be unrighteous, arbitrary and destroying the nation and has considered various ethical measures and statutory measures as well as legislative measures for his control
 mahabharat ke anushaasan parv main bhi dusht raja ko saakshaat kaliyug maanate hue, uske vadh ko uchit mana he
 It is noteworthy that Venus has accepted the system of control or emancipation of the evil and arbitrary king and has not supported his slaughter
 shukraniti saar ke anusaar sabhi vidyaon main ati kushal raja ke liye bhi rajkaarya jaise atikathin kaary ko akele hi karnaa asambhav hota he
 Hence the king should consult his assistants
 shukr ke anusaar jo raja mantri ke munh se kahi gayi hit-ahit kii baton par gaur nahin karata he vah raja hokar bhi vastav main daaku ke samaan keval praja ke dhan ko luutane vaala hi hota he
 Venus has used the word 'nature' for the members of the council of ministers
 altekar ke anusaar, ‘‘shukr kaa mat he ki keval bhojan va vivaah ke avasaron par hi jati kii poochtacha kii jaani chahie, mantriparishad main niyukti ke samay nahin
 Venus has no objection to keeping a military department under the Shudra, if he is qualified and royalist
 ‘‘ vastav main shukr kaa mat pracheen bharat kii udaar parampara ke anuroop he
 Shantiparva has clearly mentioned the appointment of three qualified Shudras in addition to the first three varnas in the mantriparishad
 pratinidhi ko itnaa yogya hona chahiai ki vah desh, kaal va sthaan ke sandarbh main karne yogya evam na karne yogya kaaryo kii pahchaan rakhata ho
 The third member of the Council of Ministers is the head who has the ability to conduct a general inspection of all the functions of governance
 chauthaa sadsy sachiv he, jo apane kaaryon kii drushti se yuddh mantri he
 He has complete knowledge of the army and its functions
 paanchavaa sadsy mantri kaa he, jise aadhunik drushti se videsh mantri yaa pararashtra mantri kah sakate he
 The sixth member is Prudivac, who is the Chief Justice and also the principal political officer of the Department of Justice
 use shastrokt evam lok prachlit aachaar kaa gyaata hona chahie
 The seventh member should be a scholar of the element of religion
 aathven sadsy sumantra ko shukr kaa vitt mantri yaa koshadhyaksh kaha ja saktaa he, jise aay-vyay kii sampoorn jaankaree honi chahie
 The ninth member should be a knower of amatya country and articles
 vah rajya main sthit nagaron, graamon, jangalon kii bhoomi kii maap kaa hisaab rakhata he or inase hone vaali aay kaa bhi vivaran rakhata he
 The last place in the order of priority is that of the messenger
 vah shadgunyamantra kaa gyaata, acha vaktaa, nirbhik, desh va kaal kii sthiti ko samajhane vaala hona chahie
 K
 According to P
 Jaiswal, in the ancient Indian political texts, the functioning of the Council of Ministers has been elaborated only in Shukranitisar
 bi
 ke
 sarkaar ke anusaar is granth main mantri parishad kii kaary pranali ke bare main agralikhit tathyon ko spasht kiya he - Members and assistants of the Council of Ministers together prepare an article on any subject related to their department
 is lekh par sarvapratham raja kii tippanee dwaara iske dosha ko samaapt kiya jaataa he
 After this, all the ministers are consulted, so that coordination and cooperation is maintained in all departments
 is lekh par sabhi mantriyon dwaara apni mudra sahit hastakshar kiye jate he
 Finally, the king revisits and gives his final decision
 is prakaar yah prakriya rajya ke liye laabhadaayak he kyonki raja likhit rup main sabaki raay bhi jaan letaa he evam antim nirnay kaa adhikaar apane paas surakshit rakhata he
 Venus mentions two types of administration - central administration and local administration
 kendriya prashasan main rajbhrityon ke mahatv ko bataate hue shukr ne raja ko paraamarsh diya he ki vah rajya kii unnati ke liye anek gyanvaan evam guni sahaayakon kii niyukti kare
 Venus has mentioned seven types of sevaks and has elaborated on the qualifications related to the appointment of officers, assistants and servants of all classes
 shukr ne sthaneey prashasan ke sanghathan kaa bhi ullekh kiya he, jisamen agralikhit 6 adhikariyon kaa ullekh he - It is imperative for efficient administration that the king keep a close watch on the officers' actions
 shukraniti main kaha gaya he ki yadi sau prajajan kisi adhikari ke viruddh aavedan patr de den, to us adhikari ko padchyut kar dena chahie
 Venus has advised that the king should take away his powers from unjust officials
 niyantran ke liye yah bhi anivaary he ki ek pad par ek vyakti adhik samay tak na rahe
 Appointment of a person to the post should be done only on the basis of merit
 shukraniti main prashasan ke 20 vibhaagon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he- gaj, ashv, swarna, rajat vibhaag aadi
 The post of president of these departments is normally called Karma Secretary, but with this, the noun of the president, husband or suzerain has been used for the post of president
 shukraniti main pratipaadit prashasnic sanghathan bahustareey he
 In addition to organized departments at the central level of administration, Venus has highlighted the organizational structure of local, rural and urban administration
 shukr kaa mat he ki prayek gram or prayek nagar main sahsaadhyaksh gram kaa adhyaksh bhagahaar kii niyukti kii jaani chahie
 The Venus policy has detailed the professional and technical qualifications of personnel employed at all levels of administration
 shukr ne prashasan kii karyaalay paddati main likhit aadesh ko atyadhik mahatv diya he
 According to him, officers or assistants should not do any work without a written decree, because only the written order containing the Rajamudra and signature of the king is the actual king, the person is not the king
 shukr ne raja ke likhit aadesh ko smriti patr ke rup main surakshit rakhane kii pranali ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 Along with this, he has also laid emphasis on preparing daily, monthly, annual and multi-year reports in administration
 prashasan ke kushal sanchaalan ke liye shukr ne soochnaaon kii pratidin prapti par jor diya he
 He is of the opinion that the king should receive information from far-flung territories every day
 shukr ne rajkeey karyaalayon kii suraksha ke liye paharedaaron va rakshakon kii vyavastha ko sweekaar kiya he
 From the point of view of the personnel system, Shukraniti can be considered as a unique text, because the exact, systematic and complete depiction of the various aspects of the personnel system is available in it, it is not found anywhere
 rajya karmchaariyon ke liai aachaar samhita : samast rajkarmchaariyon se aacharan ke saamaanya niyamon ke paalan kii apeksha kii gai he
 Employees following these rules or code of conduct are described as the best personnel in the book
 shukr ke anusaar, bhrity ko swami ke prati tathaa apane seva kaary ke prati puri tarah se samarpit hokar kaary karnaa chahie
 He should courteously inspire the king for good work and should never be merely sycophantic
 karmchaariyon ko kabhi bhi praja se jhuthe vaade nahin karne chahie
 Inappropriate actions such as bribery, gambling, anger, hostility etc
 should be abandoned
 uparyukt gunon ke vipareet kaary karne waalon ko shukr ne nikrusht mana he
 Salary, Pay Scale and Increment: In the principle of pay, both the work and the period have been made the basis, ie, the amount of work done in a certain period is given only on the basis of allowance
 shukr ne raja ko yah paraamarsh diya he ki vah vetan main katautee nahin kare or sadaiv niyat samay par hi vetan de
 It has been clearly proposed in the Shukrniti that the minimum salary of the personnel should be so that the dependents can be easily maintained
 vetanmanon ko shreshth, madhyam, sam va hin main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Venus warns the king that the employees with very low wages get dissatisfied with the rule and start taking interest in other tasks than state work
 atah jaise-jaise bhrity kii yogyata main vruddhi ho, vaise-vaise uske vetan main bhi vruddhi honi chahie, kyonki isse ant main swayan raja kaa hit hota he
 Service Period, Promotion and Degradation: In normal condition, the service period of an employee - 40 years is accepted, but with this, the recruitment should always be held and in the event of demerit, the act should be relieved
 shukraniti main karmchaariyon kii samaybaddh padonnati ke bare main spasht praavdhaan kiya gaya he, jab koi carmik apane anubhav ke aadhaar par apane pad se shreshth hota jaae to use uttarotar shreshth pad par niyukt kiya janaa chahie
 On the contrary, if a chief servant ignores his obligations due to laziness etc
, then he should be made an unreserved servant
 shukr ne bhrityon ke prashikshan kii vyavastha bhi kii he
 Pension, Compensation, Provident Fund and Bonus Arrangement: After completing 40 years in the Raj Seva, money should be given lifetime as pension after retirement
 keval pension hi nahin paariwarik pension kii vyavastha bhi he
 Raj has also accepted the scheme of provident fund for employees
 raja ko carmik ke vetan kii kul raashi kaa 1 / 6 yaa 1 / 4 bhaag katkar apane yahaan jamaa kar lenaa chahie or do yaa teen varsh baad, us jamaa raashi ke aadhe yaa puure bhaag kaa bhugtan carmik ko kar dena chahie
 Rules for rest and leisure: There is a system of 12 hours of daily work for regular workers
 karmchaariyon ko upyukt interval par tathaa vishisht paristhitiyon main kaary se avkaash pradaan kiye jane kii aavashyaktaa vyakt kii gai he evam vistrut niyamon kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 No work will be done by the employees on the day of celebration etc
 yadi koi adhik aavashyak kaary ho to utsav vaale din bhi karaane kii vyavastha kii gai he, parantu shraadh ke din kisi bhi prakaar ke kaary kaa spasht nishedh kiya gaya he
 Arrangements have also been made to provide leave to personnel at fixed intervals every day
 karmchaariyon ke aswasth ho jane par unhen ‘savetan‘ va ardhvethan avkaash kii vyavastha kii gai he
 Every year 15 days paid leave is also provided along with health leave
 kintu jab koi yogya bhrity biimaar ho jaae, uski beemaari kii avadhi kii upeksha karke use sadaiv aadha vetan avashya hi diya janaa chahie
 Thus Shukraniti is such a text of ancient Indian political thought
 jisamen carmik vyavastha kaa itnaa vistrut va vyapak vivaran diya gaya he, tathaa jo karmchaariyon ke hiton par aadhaarit he
 Venus has accepted moral values according to the country, time, position, instead of eternal moral values in social life
 shukr ne pracheen bhartiya parampara ke anusaar samaaj sanghathan kaa pramukh aadhaar varna evam ashram vyavastha ko hi sweekaar kiya he
 But he is not as rigid and very conservative as Manu
 shukr ne saamanytah janm par aadhaarit varna vyavastha ko sweekaara he
 But with this, Varna system is also supported on the basis of karma
 shukr ne brahman, kshatriya, vaisya, shudra- chaaron varnon ke paramparaagat kaaryo kaa ullekh kiya he
 And with this it is said that a person of Brahmin varna should follow the four ashrams called Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha and Sannyas
 kintu anya shesh teen varno dwaara pratham teen ashramon kaa paalan paryaapt hota he
 According to Venus, castes are formed on the basis of occupations, hence it was possible to create many castes
 yah ullekhneey he ki shukr ne manu aadi dharamshastriyon kii tarah saarvajanik jivan main varna evam jati ke mahatv ko badha-chadhaakar prastut nahin kiya he
 He is of the opinion that varna and caste have special importance in practices like marriage and food
 raashtra ke prashasan main shukr ne varna evam jati kii tulana main vyakti ke karm, sheel evam gun ko hi mahatvapurn mana he or raja ko nirdesh diya he ki vah rajkeey adhikariyon evam bhrityon kii niyukti main vyakti ke karm, sheel evam gun ko hi aadhaar banaae
 Venus has not demonstrated the superior superiority of Brahmins or inferiority of Shudras
 is drushti se dandshastri shukr kii samaaj vyavastha manu se adhik udaar, yathartwaadee evam vyaavhaarik he
 Following the ancient Indian tradition, Venus has imposed two controls on the king's right to levy taxes
 raja brahma dwaara niyukt aisa praja sevak he, jo praja se kar ke rup main apana vetan praapt karata he, atah praja paalan ke karttavya kii purti ke liye hi raja ko kar lagane kaa adhikaar hota he
 The king should follow the rules of memory for tax assessment, the king does not have the right to determine or collect arbitrary tax
 rajya ke strot ke rup main kar kaa swaroop aisa hona chahie kii ped se fal tod liya jaae kintu ped, pattiyon,tahaniyon ko nuksaan naa pahunche| raja ko mali ke rup main fal kaa upyog kar beej ko punah ropit kar dena chahie| There are two types of taxation system in Shukraniti essence - sthaneey kar pranali National Tax System
 shukracharya ne sthaneey aavashkataaon kii purti ke liye sthaneey karadhaan ke siddhanth ko sweekaara he jaise-nagar ke grihon kii rakshak police kaa bharan-poshan grihasthon se praapt vetan se kiya janaa chahie
 This includes all taxes other than local
 isamen do kaalon ke prasang main kar niti ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 General tax policy saamanyakalin niti :- saamaanya kaal main shukr ne praja kii aarthik kshamta ko dhyaan main rakhkar kar lagane kaa nirdesh diya he
 He opines that the fee should be taken in such a quantity that the taxpayer's original capital does not end
 raja ko bhaag ke sangrah main mali kii pravriti kaa anukaran karnaa chahie
 The tax should be taken in such a way that it is in the interest of both the king and the subjects, the tax should not be taken unjustly and unjustly; on doing so, the king is destroyed
 jo raja apane kosh main vruddhi chahta he, use praja paalan kaa daayitv avashya hi puraa karnaa chahie
 In times of crisis, the king has the right to increase the amount of tax and also to impose taxes on tax-free items in general
 isiilie shukr ne saamanyakaal main tirthasthan va devsthan ko karmukt mana he, kintu sankatkaal main nahin
 Venus has accepted the system of taxation as well as taxation in terms of economic development of the people
 gharelu upbhog hetu kharide jane vaale dhaany evam vastra, kutumb-paalan hetu dudharu pashu ko pashu kar se mukti, vyapaar main haani uthaane vaala saudagar, tirth snaan va dev sthaan nae udyog lagane yaa nae krishi kaary main jab tak duguna laabh-praapt na ho jaae is niti se shukr kii lok kalyankari niti kaa gyaan praapt hota he
 It is a tax levied on agricultural produce
 bhaag kii vasuuli ke liye 3 pramukh aadhaaron kaa ullekh kiya gaya he - According to Venus, one can recover the inheritance with the help of a rich man, with the help of an act called Grampal or with the help of an officer called Matharhar
 shukr ne bhartiya parampara ke anusaar anaaj yaa nakad ke rup main kar lene kaa ullekh kiya he
 When the farmer submits the part, he should be given a government printed part
 shulk : shukr ke anusaar raja ko us kreta yaa vikreta se shulk praapt karnaa chahie, jo aarthik len dein main laabh kii sthiti main ho shulk kii vasuuli main chal kapat nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Size-tax: In ancient India, the tax levied on mineral production was called and taxed as a commodity
 shukr ke anusaar raja utpaadan par hone vaale vyay ko katkar, khan se utpann hone vaali dhaatuon-swarna, rajat, tamba aadi par alag-alag dar se yah kar praapt karata tha
 The more expensive the metal, the higher the size and tax was
 trin kaashthadi par kar : eendhan ke liye jangal se lakdi ekatrit karne waalon par, yah kar vastu ke rup main liya jaataa tha
 Animal tax: Animal husbandry was a major occupation in ancient India, so there was a tradition of taxing it
 bakrii, bhed, gaay, bhens, aadi sabhi par kar lagaaya jaataa tha
 The rate varied
 byaaj kar : raja ko sahuukaar kii byaaj kaa 32waan hissaa kar ke rup me praapt karne kaa adhikaar tha
 Tax on residential and commercial land: There should be the same rate of tax on this land as fixed for agricultural land
 yatri kar : manu ne jalmaarg par, jabaki shukr ne thalmaarg par kar kaa ullekh kiya he
 Arrangements have been made to collect taxes from passengers for road safety, repair and cleaning
 hastshilpiyon va kalakaaron par kar : shukr ke anusaar kaarigaron va shilpiyon se ek paksh main ek din nickshulk kaary karaayaa janaa chahie
 It is clear from the above discussion of the prohibitive and positive rules laid down in Shukraniti in relation to the tax system that the tax system of the state has been provided in accordance with the expectations of the 'public welfare state'
 shukr ne nyaay kaary ke mahatv ko sweekaar karte hue raja ke 8 pradhan karttavyon main dusht-nigrah ko shaamil kiya he
 This judicial process helps the subjects to practice religion
 raja kaa karttavya he ki vah mukademon kaa uchit prakaar se nirnay kare or is bare main sattapurvak prajajan se apane nirnay kaa paalan karwaae
 Venus has not given a detailed explanation of the conceptual aspect of justice, as is available in Kautilya's Arthashastra and Manusmriti
 nyaay ke sansthagat or prakriyaatmak paksh kaa shukr ne vistrut vivaran diya he
 The rights and responsibilities of the parties related to the organization of judiciary, judicial process and litigations have been discussed in detail
 shukr dwaara nyaayik prakriya ke antargat raja evam sabha kaa ullekh kiya gaya he tathaa vishesh prasangon main sahaayta karne ke liye ‘juri‘ kaa bhi ullekh kiya gaya he
 In Shukraniti, the king has been considered as the main deciding or supreme authority of the entire judicial system, but it has been made clear that the king is only the formal head of the judiciary
 shukr ne raja se shastron ke anuroop nyaayik kaaryon ko bhalee bhaanti dekhne kii apeksha kii gai he
 The king has also mentioned the serious consequences of taking decisions without the consent of the councilors alone
 sabha - shukr ne rajya ke kendriya nyaayalay ko sabha yaa nyaayasabha kaha he
 The gathering is a place where the temporal conduct and interests of a person are examined according to the law of memory
 shukr ne aise das sadhano kaa ullekh kiya he, jinaki madad se sabha nyaay-kaary ko bhalee bhaanti main samarth hoti he
 These ten tools are- shukr ke anusaar, sabha main pratham sthaan raja kaa hota he, jo sabha kaa sabhapatitv karata he
 The king can appoint his representative in the assembly, which Venus has called pradevivaka, which besides the assembly is also a member of the Council of Ministers
 shukr ne brahman varna ko praathamikta dene ke saath hi sabhi jatiyon se sabha ke sadsy bananaa sweekaar kiya he
 Ambika Prasad Vajpayee has said, "venus has given a special principle in relation to the councilors
 jin logon kaa vivaad ho unhi ke vyavsaay se sabhasad banaae jaae, jaise- kisaanon ke vivaad main kisaan kyonki vahi apane vyavsaay ke niyamon ke vishay main adhik acchhee tarah jaanate hai
 "this description of Shukraniti makes his judicial system more liberal, rational and realistic
" mukhya nyaayadhish : raja ke baad yahi sarvocch nyaayik padaadhikari mana gaya he
 According to Venus, such a person should be appointed on this post
 jiskaa vidhi-shaastra kaa gyaan atyant vyapak va vishesh ho tathaa jisaki nishpakshta va nishtha andeh se pare ho
 Personnel and resources of the court: Court should provide proper number of employees and resources, otherwise the court cannot do its work smoothly
 atah shukr kaa mat he ki vahi nyaayasabha pavitra hoti he, jisamen mukademen ke nirnay ke liye aavashyak samast saadhan uplabdh ho
 The arbitrary behavior of judges has been prohibited in Shukraniti
 unke liye kuch niyamon kii vyavastha kii gai he
 The king should carry out his duty of justice properly and while doing justice, following the traditions of different castes, categories and clans, should decide and follow the religion
 sabhaasadon ko sabha main satya avashya kahana chahie
 At the time of the judicial process, the king or judge must conduct respectfully to the plaintiff
 vyavhaar : saral shabdon main vyavhaar kaa arth he- 'nyaayalay main chalane vaale mukademe kii nyaayik prakriya'
 It is through this judicial process that it is known who is a criminal and who is innocent
 vyavhaar ke charan : shukr ne mukademe kii nyaayik prakriya ke chaar charan sweekaar kiye he
 Any litigation begins with a written or oral statement of the antecedent as to whether a lawsuit is made
 iske baad doosraa charan pratipaksh prarambh hota he
 Now the court questions and questions both the plaintiff and the defendant
 yadi nyaayalay yah anubhav karata he ki vastav main kanoon kii drushti se koi mukadmaa banataa he, to mukadmaa apane tritiy charan arthath kriyaapad main pravesh karata he
 Otherwise it ends in the second foot
 kriya paad ke antargat mukademe main prastut vibhinn pramaanon kii kadi jaanch kii jaati he or mukademen main nihit satya va asaty kii jaankaree praapt kii jaati he
 Venus has given two basic types of all evidences - shukr ne daivi pramaan ko maanush pramaan se kam mahatvapurn mana he or isliai kisi bhi prakaar ke maanush pramaan ke abhaav main devi pramaan ko uchit bataaya he
 The fourth and final phase of the judicial process is the decision footing
 shukr ne 6 prakaar ke nirnay bataae he - According to Venus, with the announcement of the decision, a winning letter should be given to the winner
 ise ek kanoonee dastavej ke rup main bhi manyata pradaan kii he
 Both the plaintiff and the defendant must appear in the court
 shukr ne apane purvavartiyon ke vipareet nai vyavasthaaon jaise-punarvichaar sammaan, jamaanat or niyogi kaa bhi ullekh kiya he
 According to Venus, the Niyogi should have knowledge of the law and he should charge according to the rules
 shukr ne aparaadh ke das prakaaron kaa ullekh kiya he- inamen rajagna kaa ulanghan, stri kii hatya, chori karnaa aadi sammilit he
 In fact, these 10 crimes are crimes against the state, society, morality and religion
 shukr ne dandaneey aparaadhon main 50 prakaar ke chhalon kaa ullekh kiya he
 Venus considered these crimes committed against the king
 shukr ne sabhi prakaar ke aparaadhon ko chaar mul virgo main baanta he - Physical crime is committed by body, speech by speech, mental crime by mind and worldly crime by association or cooperation with someone
 shukr kaa mat he ki prayek aparaadh kii guruta evam laghutaa ko jaanakar hi apradhi ko dandit kiya janaa chahie
 a detailed classification of the categories of crimes has been made in Shukraniti, which expresses the systematic, practical and scientific view of Shukraniti concerning crimes
 shukraniti main saamaajik, aarthik, naitik, rajnatik, va prashasnic samast prakaar ke aparaadhon ko mahatv pradaan karte hue unke pratikaar kii apeksha kii gai he
 In Shukraniti, there is a provision of not giving life sentence and justification for providing punishment for killing only for a serious crime like treason
 pracheen bhartiya parampara main ‘dand‘ shabd ke anek arth he
 Here Venus has two meanings of punishment - yadhyapi anyatra shukr ne dand kaa arth sena, yuddh evam nyaay vyavastha ko bhi sweekaar kiya he, vastav main dand janata ko bure aacharan se mukti dilaataa he
 The punished policy of the king proves all works and punishment is the ultimate protector of religions
 shukr ne manu va yajyavlky ke samaan hi nyaayik prashasan yaa aparaadh unmoolan ke sandarbh main dand ke agralikhit chaar prakaar sweekaar kiye he - According to Venus, it is advisable to only give a good man or a middle man a speech or a dhikand, they do not have a corrective effect on the unhappy men, so this punishment is not for them
 shukr ne aparaadh va dand ke parsparik sambandh ko sweekaar kiya he
 The king who acts after taking care of this relationship of crime and punishment, is satisfied by the people
 keval apradhi hi dandaneey he
 Immortal is always indomitable
 dand kii maatra, aparaadh ke anusaar hi honi chahie
 He cannot be punished arbitrarily
 raja ko dand dene main atyadhik kathor nahin hona chahie
 Venus has arranged different punishments for the same type of crime for superior, middle, and half-male men, which makes the asymmetric side of Venus's punishment policy clear
 parantu shukr ne aise aparaadhon kaa bhi ullekh kiya he, jinamein dand sabko samaan diya jaataa he, jaise- rajdroh
 It is noteworthy that Venus has adopted a more egalitarian system in the field of punishment than Manu
 aadhunik dand siddhanth kii drushti se yah kaha ja saktaa he ki shukr ne pratikaratmak dand siddhanth ko sweekaar nahin kiya he parantu shukraniti main avarohak, nirodhak or sudharatmak dand siddhanton ko avashya hi sweekaar kiya gaya he
 Venus, under the tradition of ancient Indian Acharyas, has given a detailed discussion of 'per-nation relations' i
e
 their state and the mutual relations of other states
 adhyayan kii drushti se ham in vichaaron ko do pramukh bhaagon main vibhajit kar sakate he - Venus did not mention the divisional principle similar to Kautilya, but has accepted the existence of four types of states
 shukr ne rajyon ke vargeekaran kaa aadhaar unki bhugolic sthiti ko nahin mana he apitu vijigishu raja evam anya rajyon ke bich unke rajait kii sthiti ko mana he
 Venus has given enough importance to the Rajhit and Shakti elements in the operation of the Parashtra policy
 unke anusaar prayek raja apane rajait ko hi saadhy maanata he or jab vijigishu raja anya rajyon ke sandarbh main apni shakti ke anusaar niti ke upayon evam shadgun mantra ke sadhano kaa kushaltam prayog karata hai to use safalataa milti he
 According to Venus, just as the serpent, elephant and lion are administered by the king, similarly, the king should make friends and foes as his captive by appropriate measures
 shukr ne niti ke chaar paramparaagat upayon kaa hi ullekh kiya he - Content policy can only be used against both friend and foe
 shanti va maitri kii niti se jahaan mitrataa adhik majboot hoti he
 At the same time, help and cooperation towards the enemy king is also certain
 shatru ke prati saamaniti kaa prayog donon rajyon kii aapasi suraksha main abhivruddhi karnaa he
 Donation policy is also used towards both enemy and friend
 mitra raja se yah kahana ki meri sabhi vastuen, yahan tak ki jivan bhi, tumhaara he, mitra ke prati daan niti kehalaati hai
 Giving direct money to the enemy king is called a donation policy towards him
 bhed niti ke prayog ko shukr ne mitra ke viruddh anuchit mana he, kintu kuch sthitiyon main uchit bhi mana he
 Three types of discrimination policy can be used against the enemy king - isamen atirikt bhed ke dwaara shatru raja va uski rajbhakt praja ke madhya matbhed utpann karaae ja sakate he
 Punishment can also be used against both friends and enemies
 mitra raja ko yah chetavanee dena ki vah yadi manamaana vyavhaar karegaa to main tumhaara mitra nahin rahoonga- dand niti he
 Whereas to show the faults of enemy king, destroy money, suffer in war, it is punishable
 yadyapi shukr dwaara mitra raajaaon ke prati bhed va dand niti ko aniatik kaha ja saktaa he, lekin yah unki yathartwaadee niti he
 According to Venus, the king should use these four policy measures after careful consideration
 shukr ne atyant prabal shatru ke liye sam or daan kaa, apane se adhik balavaan ke liye sam or bhed kaa, apane baraabar shakti vaale ke liye bhed or dand kaa prayog uchit mana he
 This means - a specific concept with 6 properties
 yadhyapi kautilya ke samaan shukr ne in gunon kaa vistaar se vivechan nahin kiya he
 Its 6 properties are as follows- sandhi :- shukr ne sandhi ko aisa saadhan mana he, jiske dwaara shaktishaalee shatru se hinabal raja kii mitrataa hoti he arthath hinabal raja ko suraksha praapt hoti he
 Underlining the importance of the treaty, he said, "just as no one can cut or uproot a group of bamboos surrounded by thick thorns, in the same way no one can defeat a king, even with a mulch
 
 ’’ shukr ekmaatr aise pracheen acharya he, jo apane hit kii purti ke liye anarya raja se bhi sandhi ko bhi uchit maanate he
 Deity: Deity means the end of the policy of peace and cooperation between kings and the beginning of tension and conflict
 jis kaary dwaara shatru ko peedit kiya jaae or adheen kiya jaae, use vigrah kehete he
 In fact, the Deity is such a policy, by which the powerful king, by suffering the weak king, forces him to walk according to himself, without direct war
 yahi kaaran he ki budhimaan raja ko sandhi se bandhe hue shatru kaa bhi vishwaas nahin karnaa chahie
 Giving the example of Vritrasura-slaughter by Indra, Venus has said that Indra also did this by making a pact with a pledge not to reprimand
 kintu shukr ne balavaan shatru se vigrah kaa nishedh kiya he
 In the end, Venus has considered the Deity justified when there is no option left for defense
 yaan :- jab apane icchit hit kii prapti ke liye shatru raja kaa naash aavashyak hota he or is uddeshy se us par akraman kiya jaataa he, tab ise yaan kehete he
 The negative objective of the vehicle is to destroy the enemy
 kintu sakaaratmak uddeshy he, aarthik sainik, va raajnneetik laabh kii prapti
 Only the powerful king should use the vehicle against the weak king
 asana :- jahaan anya aacharyo ne asana kaa arth - shatru raja ke prati upeksha tatasthta evam niskriyata kii niti mana he
 Venus has considered it a military siege of the enemy king's fort or city, which, while protecting itself, forces the enemy to contact on its own terms
 asana dwaara shatru raja kii rasad pankti nasht kar di jaati he
 Internal dissatisfaction arises on enemy side due to lack of war material and food items etc
 or tab vah shatru raja vivash hokar adheenta sweekaar kar letaa he
 Shelter: - When a weak king's kingdom is destroyed by a powerful enemy king or there is a crisis of such defeat, the weak king should take shelter of another powerful king for his protection, which can increase his power
 dwaidhi bhav :- iskaa shabdic arth he ek hi samay main do bhaavon kaa paaya janaa jo prakat rup main dikhaaya jaataa he
 In secret, it is treated exactly opposite
 prakat rup main mitrataa evam gupt rup main shatruta isaki visheshta he
 In the operation of the army, Venus has also mentioned the double sentiment
 sena ko anek tukadiyon main baantkar shatru ko prakat rup main apane sainik bal ke bare main rakhana dwaidhi bhav he
 Venus has mentioned four major institutional tools for practical operation - doot : doot ko shukr ne mantriparishad ke 10 sadasyon main bhi sthaan diya he
 He does the work related to diplomacy and foreign policy
 vah raja kaa aisa bhramanshil pratinidhi he jo anya raajaaon se samvaad sthapit karata he
 Therefore, he should be skilled in speech art, who understands the state of the country and time, understands the heart's feelings of others and has a fearless nature
 guptchar : shukraniti main arthshaastra ke samaan guptchar kii vyavastha kaa vyapak ullekh nahin kiya gaya he
 There is also silence about the types of intelligence, intelligence administration is the main means of protecting the king and the state from external and internal enemies
 guptchar kaa kaary he- raja ke shatru sevakon va praja ke vyavhaar ko jaananaa va uski jaankaree raja ko dena
 The king should also test his veracity and punish untrue detectives
 sena : shukr ke anusaar sena vyaktiyon, pashuon aadi kaa samooh he, jo astr, shastr se susajjit hoti he
 Due to the army, the destruction of the enemy is possible and there is an increase of treasury, state and might
 shukr ne sainik anushaasan va acharsanhita par bhi vichaar kiya he
 The king should always make such an effort that there is no difference in his army, whereas there must be a difference in the enemy army
 yuddh main vijay praapt hon par sainikon ko bhi laabh milanaa chahie or unhen lut ke maal main bhagidaar banaakar santusht rakhana chahie
 War: Venus has acknowledged the need for war to protect against external challenges and to expand her kingdom
 sabhi raja rajya vistaar kii kaamana rakhte he
 Therefore, they also have mutual enmity
 shukr ke anusaar jab niti ke vibhinn upaay evam shadgun mantra se bhi safalataa nahin mili, tab antim saadhan ke rup main yuddh ko apnaanaa chahie
 Shukraniti is probably the only text in ancient Indian texts, in which war is defined
 shukr ke anusaar, paraspar shatru bhav rakhte hue do raajaaon kaa astr-shastr kaa prayog karnaa yuddh he
 Venus mentions two types of war, based on the observance and violation of moral rules in war
 dharm yuddh, evam kutayudh
 Venus has given details of the moral rules of the crusade
 kintu unhone manu kii tarah kutayudh par dharm yuddh kii shreshthata kaa samarthan nahin kiya he
 Venus clearly states that a religious war or a code war in which the enemy is destroyed is justified
 vastav main shukr ne yathartwaadee drushtikon apanaate hue dharm yuddh par kuta yuddh ko variyata di he
 Venus did not consider war to be a sinful and heinous act, but mentioned that a Kshatriya gets good results when he dies in war
 kshatriya ke liye yuddh ko pavitra kartavya maanane kaa aagrah shukr kii is apeksha ko vyakt karata he ki vah avasar aane par yuddh se palaayan na karen
 Dealing with the defeated side: Venus has advised the victorious king not to take malicious actions against the victorious kingdom and its subjects after victory in the war
 unhone vijayi raja ko vijit rajya kii praja ko prasann rakhane kaa nirdesh diya he
 Venus has expected the victorious king to conquer the enemy and collect taxes from him, according to circumstances, to occupy half of the enemy's kingdom or the entire kingdom
 uske pashchaat shatru kii praja ko har prakaar se prasann rakhe tathaa apni praja kii bhaanti hi uskaa paalan kare
 Venus has also advised the king to remove the ministerial council functioning in the conquered state and appoint a new ministerial council that is loyal to him
 yadi vah parajeet raja kaa rajya chin le to use, jaagir aadi jeevika ke liye pradaan kare
 The conquering king should not rule arbitrarily in the won state
 uski putravat raksha karte hue use prasann rakhaa janaa chahie or use apana bana lenaa chahie
 In fact, there is a sense in this description of Venus that the religious moral and social values of the subjects and society of the defeated state should be protected and the subjects should also be followed
 manu multah dharamshastreey vichaarak he, kautilya arthshaastreey vichaarak he, jabaki shukr raajnneetik vichaarak hai
 That is why they have a special place and importance in ancient Indian political thought
 altekar kaa mat he, ‘‘shukraniti main prashasnic mahatv kii aisi anek suchnaaain milti he, jo arthshaastra sahit anya kisi granth main uplabdh nahin he
 It is true that Venus did not elaborate on the theoretical aspects of the state, but in ancient India there was a tradition to throw light on the practical side
 adhyayan kii suvidha ke liye shukr ke yogadan ko nimnlikhit binduon ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he - Recognition of Dandaniti as the most prominent discipline: Venus, following the Dandaniti Classical Oceanic Sampradaya, has demonstrated the superiority of practical and temporal knowledge over theoretical and theological knowledge
 dandniti ke prayog se raja ko sabhi falon kii siddhi hoti he, yahaan tak ki vah satyuga kii sthapana bhi kar saktaa he
 Rendering a liberal and practical socio-political system: Venus has recognized the varna system as the basis of social organization
 kintu unhone karmanusaar varna vyavastha kii dharna kaa samarthan kiya he
 Thus Venus has tried to ignore the selfishness and inefficiency inherent in the Varna system based on birth and has given the idea of re-creation of Varna system on the basis of karma, merit and talent
 varna evam jati kaa mahatv vivaah evam bhojan saamudayik jivan main hota he
 In public and political work like national administration, merit and expertise based on working and quality is more important than varna and caste
 manu kii tulana main shukr ke vichaar paryaapt udaar hai or us saamaajik parivartan kii ore sanket karte he jo unke yug main janm le rahaa tha
 Implicit theory of the state: Following the Indian tradition, the notion of 'weekend State' is accepted
 unhone rajya ke saaton angon kii tulana maanav sharir ke ango se kii he
 Venus has also given the name of tree to the state, this description of Venus is important in terms of explaining the intangible structure like state
 rajyon kaa vargeekaran : shukranitisar aisa ekmaatr pracheen bhartiya granth he, jisane ek sunishchit aadhaar par rajtantreey rajya ke vibhinn prakaaron kaa ullekh kiya he
 This classification also points towards the imperial imperialist system of governance of ancient India
 rajpad par yathartwaadee dhang se vichaar : shukr ne manu ke samaan raja ko 'nar dev' nahin mana he
 Venus has a clear view that even after all the dignity of the Rajapada, the king is basically a servant of the people and in this form has given him the right to receive tax
 shukr ne praja paalan ko raja kaa aadharbhoot kartavya mana he
 Development of Ancient Council of Ministers: Shukraniti is the only text which clearly shows the order of preference of ministers, difference in salary, office etc
 shukr ne hi sarvapratham mantriparishad kii vibhageeya paddati, mantriyon ke vibhaag parivartan, mantralayon ke sanghathan aadi kaa ullekh kiya he
 Venus has also first made a clear mention of the definite and written functioning of the council of ministers
 kosh, arth-vyavastha evam prajahitkaari rajya : yah ullekhneey he ki kaal-saapeksh, adarsh kosh kii dharna kaa ullekh keval shukr ne hi kiya he
 This fund should be so rich that even if the tax is not collected, it will be able to protect the subjects and the army for 20 years
 shukr ekmaatr aise rajshastri he, jinhone rajya kii aay-vyay kii vaarshik yojana kaa ullekh kiya he
 Compared to Acharyas etc
 Manu, Kautilya, expenditure details of Venus are more clear, definite and fixed
 shukr ne apane vyay ke vivaran main jan kalyaan evam samaaj kalyaan par bhi bal diya he
 Description of developed administrative system: The administrative system of Venus is more complex and developed than Manusmriti
 isamen likhit karyaalay paddati, rajasevakon kii aachaar samhita, nunatam evam adhiktam vetan ke siddhanth aadi kaa bhi ullekh kiya gaya he
 Venus has also mentioned the rules of service period, promotion, demotion, training, uniforms etc
 of personnel
 shukr ne prashasan kii is carmik vyavastha ke antargat kuch aisi vyavasthaaon kaa bhi ullekh kiya he jo aadhunik prashasnic vyavasthaaon ke paryaapt nikat prathit hoti hai
 He has also mentioned general rest, leave, health leave, retirement including pension, family pension, provident fund, bonus etc
 nyaay prashasan kaa shreshth vivaran : yadhyapi shukr ne nyaay prashasan main dharamshastreey parampara kaa anukaran kiya he, kintu iske saath hi unhonen nyaay prashasan main kuch nae tatwon kaa ullekh kiya he
 Membership for the judicial assembly includes not only the essentiality of Brahmin varna, the jury system, summons, bail, appeals and reconsideration, Niyogi etc
 par-raashtra sambandhon kii saiddhanthik evam yathartwaadee vivechna : jahaan is kshetra main manu adarshavaadi adhik hai, vahiin shukr ne yathartwaadee sambandhon kaa pramukh aadhaar hi rajyon kii aapasi avishwasaneeyata ko sweekaar kiya he
 He has given the elements of state interest and power a major place in the conduct of foreign policy, which is similar to the modern period
 yadhyapi shukr ne parajeet raja evam parajeet pradesh ke adarshavaadi paksh kaa samarthan kiya he kintu aise vyavhaar kaa antim uddeshy yathartwaadee hi he
 Such a policy provides stability to the victorious king's victory over the defeated side
 shukr ne rajya evam raashtra ke madhya bhed ko spasht kiya he tathaa yah spasht kiya he ki raashtra sampradaay kaa niyantran hi use rajya kaa swaroop pradaan karata he
 Thus Venus has given a detailed description of the political system found under the monarchical system of governance of his era
 benny prasad kaa mat he ki shukranitisar pracheen hindu samaajik va raajnneetik parampara main likhaa gaya aisa atyant mahatvapurn granth he, jisane sabhi vishyon ko sparsh kiya he or unhen sanvaara va samrudh bhi kiya he
 According to Altekar, "this is a very important book for the scholars of ancient Indian politics
 iske saath hi bhartiya chintan parampara main unka vishisht sthaan he
 '' aplikeshan software yaa anuprayog software, jo keval app bhi kehalaata he, kisi vishisht kaary ke liye prayukt computer software kehalaata he
 It is different from system software

 Thus Jhalawar was the last princely state created by the British in Rajasthan

 Sri Krishna Bhatt Kavikalanidhi, a contemporary of Sawai Jai Singh, hailed from the courts of Bundi and Jaipur, was a great poet of andhra-tailang-bhatt, Sanskrit and Braj Bhasha
 "savai jaisingh dwitiya ne apane samay main jin vidwatpariwaron ko baahar se laa kar apane rajya main jaagir tathaa sangrakshan diya unamem andhra pradesh se aayaa yah tailang brahman parivaar pramukh sthaan rakhata he
 Kavikalanidhi Srikrishnabhatta was born in this family, who made the state proud by composing many texts like 'ishwar Vilas', 'padyamuktavali', 'raghav Geet' etc
 inhone savai jaisingh se sammaan praapt kiya tha, ashwamedh yajna main bhaag liya tha, jaipur ko basate hue dekha tha or uskaa ek aitihaasik mahakavy main varnan kiya tha
 This erudite scholar of devarshi-kul had gained enough fame, prosperity and honor during his life time due to his talent
 " Bhatt Mathuranath Shastri recalled his ancestor Kavikalanidhi in Soratha verses in the Sanskrit verse, in these words - Tulsi-sur-vihari-krishnabhatta-bharvi-mukhah
 bhashakavitaakaari-kavyah kasy na sambhta:
 
 " is parivaar ke uttar bharat main pravajan kaa itihaas bada dilachasp he jiskaa abhilekh isi vansh ke vidwaanon ne "kulprabandh" naamak sanskrit kavy main abhilikhit bhi kar diya he
 Most of the scholars of South India came to North India as companions of the whole of India or pilgrimage by Acharyas such as Shankaracharya or Vallabhacharya, some of whom had the kings of the princely states influenced by their valor to be their guru or Rajpandit
 Accepted and settled there

 Gradually, they adopted Hindi or North Indian languages as their mother tongue

 Reva Naresh Gopal Singh, impressed by the valor of Bavi Ji Dixit's great-grandson Mandal Dixit, made him a Rajguru and gave it to the village Jagir called Divarikhiya
 uske baad se unka avatank devarshi ban gaya
 In Andhra families, the practice has been to name your village at the beginning of its name - like 'sarvepalli Radhakrishnan'
 " Bhattji's family Reinva Naresh, also known as 'bandhav-naresh', lived for a few years under the umbrella and from there Bundi Rajasthan settled because Raja of Bundi was also a virtue of Vaidusya
 jab bundi rajpariwaar kaa sambandh rinva main hua to vahaan ke kuch raaj panditon ko jaagiren de kar unhone bundi main laa basaaya
 Sri Krishna Bhatt Kavikalanidhi was the Rajpandit of the Bundi kingdom under the rule of Budhi's King Budhsinh, who was the brother-in-law of Sawai Jai Singh
 "vah veda, puraana, darshan, vyakaran, sangeet aadi shastron ke maanya vidwaan to the hi, sanskrit, praakrit or brajabhasha ke ek apratim vaktaa or kavi bhi the- savai jaisingh inase itane prabhavit hue ki unase kisi bhi keemat par amer aa jane kaa anurodh kiya

 In his scholarly tradition, scholars like Dwarkanath Bhatt, Jagdish Bhatt, Vasudev Bhatt, Mandan Bhatt, Devarshi Ramanath Shastri, Bhatt Mathuranath Shastri, Devarshi Kalanath Shastri have illuminated the Sanskrit world with their creative features and enormous literature surgeons
 devarshi shrikrishna bhatta ji ko ‘kaviklanidhi’ tathaa ‘ramrasacharya’ kii oopaadhi pradaan karke sammanit kiya gaya tha
 Maharaja Jai singh had honored him with the adornment of 'kavikalanidhi', impressed by his wonderful Vaidusya on the Vedas and his unique ability to perform poetry in Sanskrit, Prakrit and Brajbhasha
 swayan savai jaisingh ne hi unhen ‘ramrasacharya’ kii padavi se bhi sammanit kiya tha, jiske sandarbh main ek rochak prasang kaa vivaran miltaa he
 During one of the courts, Maharaja Jai singh asked the councilors that as the description of Shri Krishna's Rasleela is received, is there any mention of the episode of Shri Ram's Raslila like that? There was silence in the whole court
 tabhi shrikrishna bhatta ji khadey hue or unhone kaha ki aisi ek pustak kaashi main uplabdh he
 The king asked him to bring this book within two months
 shrikrishna bhatta ji yah jaanate the ki vastav main aisi koi pustak kahin thi hi nahin, jab ki unhone aisi pustak ke kaashi main hone kii baat kah di thi
 He himself started writing poetry on Rama-rasa and within two months he prepared a book called 'ramarasa' in Brajbhasha which was equivalent to Ramayana
 samay seemaa ke andar pustak paakar or yah jaan kar ki yah kavy swayan kaviklanidhi shrikrishna bhatta ne hi likhaa he, kavita-kala-marmajna maharaja atyant prasann hue or unhone bhattaji ko “ramrasacharya” kii padavi or vipul dhanrashi dekar sammanit kiya
