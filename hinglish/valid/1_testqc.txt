 barason ke adhyayan ke baad jab 1916 main albert oinstin ne is siddhant kii ghoshnaa kii to vigyaan kii duniya main tahalaka much gaya or dhai-sau saal se qaayam ijak newton dwaara 1687 main ghoshit brahmand kaa nazariyaa hameshaa ke liye ulat diya gaya
 It had such a profound effect on physics that people began to describe modern physics as a subject different from classical physics and Albert Einstein came to be considered the father of modern physics
 dik sanskrit kaa shabd he jiskaa arth he ird-gird kii jagah
 It is called "space" in English
 manushya dik ke teen pahaluon ko bhaap sakane kii kshamta rakhte hai- upar-neeche, aage-peeche or daayen-baayein
 In ordinary life, humans do not see any change in problems
 newton kii bhautikee kahati thi ki agar antariksh main do vastuen ek-duusare se ek kilometre dur hai or un donon main se koi bhi na hile, to ve ek-duusare se ek kilometre dur hi rahengi
 Our ordinary life also shows us this
 lekin inastin ne kaha ki aisa nahin he
 The problem may worsen and shrink
 aisa bhi sambhav he ki jo do vastuen ek-duusare se ek kilometre dur hai ve swayan na hilen, lekin unke bich kaa dik kuch paristhitiyon ke kaaran fail kar sava kilometre ho jaae yaa sikud ke pauna kilometre ho jaae
 In Newton's classical physics, it was said that the speed of time is the same everywhere in the universe
 agar aap ek jagah tik kar baithe hai or aapkaa koi mitra prakaash se aadhi gati kii raftaar par das saal kaa safar tay kare to, us safar ke baad, aapke bhi das saal guzar chuke honge or aapke dost ke bhi
 But Einstein also said that this belief is wrong
 jab koi chiz gati se chalati he, uske liye samay dhire ho jaataa he or vah jitna tej chalati he, samay utana hi dhire ho jaataa he
 If your friend returned by traveling at half the speed of light for ten years according to his own, then ten years would have passed but eleven and a half years would have passed
 inastin ne saapekshata siddhant main dikhaaya ki vastav main dik ke teen or kaal kaa ek milakar brahmand main chaar pahaluon vaala dik-kaal he jisame sari vasteen or urjaayen sthit hotin hai
 This problem is not permanent - neither problem occurs without any change and it is not necessary that the flow of time is the same for every thing
 dik-kaal ko prabhavit kar ke use maroda, khinchaa or sikoda ja saktaa he or aisa hi brahmand main hota he
 The concept of time travel has been created through this principle
 dik-kaal main badlaav har vastu or har raftaar paidaa karti he lekin badi vasteen or prakaash ke sameep kii raftaarein adhik badlaav paidaa karti hai
 Humans are so small and their speed is so slow that they do not see the effects of the theory of relativity in their lives, but when they study more things in the universe, they find signs of relativity in many places
 jab vastu kaa veg prakaash ke veg kaa 5% bhi ho jaae, to saapekshata ke siddhanth ke chinh hame dikhaai dene lagate he
 Newton believed that every object had a force to pull towards itself, which he called gravity
 prithvi jaisi badi chiz main yah gurutvkarshan bahut adhik hota he, jisase ham prithvi se chipke rahete hai or anayas hi ud kar antariksh main nahin chale jate
 But Newton could not explain how the force of gravity actually works and why
 inastin ne kaha ki aapekshikta ke siddhanth ke anusaar yah vichaar ki bhautik vastuen ek doosar ko aakarshith karti hai, ek bhram he, jo prakruti sambandhi galat yantrik dharanaon ke kaaran paidaa hua he
 He said that the earth is large and because of that the time period around him has turned and folded over itself
 ham is khiche-mude dik-kaal main rahete hai or is mudan kii vajah se prithvi ke qareeb dhakele jate hai
 This can be compared to a sheet whose four corners have been pulled by four people
 ab is chadar ke bich main ek baari gola rakh diya jaae, to chadar bich se baith jaaegi, yani uske soot main bich main mudan paidaa ho jaaegi
 Now if we place a light ball on the corner of the sheet, it will roll towards the big circle
 inastin ne kaha ki koi anaadi aadmi yah dekh kar kah saktaa he ki choti gend ko bade gole ne khinchaa isliye gend uske paas gai
 But the real reason was that the ball wanted to go towards the ground and the shell created such a twist in the sheet that the ball went to him
 isi tarah se unhone kaha ki yah ek mithyaa he ki gurutvkarshan kisi aakarshan kii vajah se hota he
 The real reason for gravity is that every object which is moving in space, comes under the influence of such a problem of difficulty and starts moving towards something bigger
 vastut: gurutvkarshan jadta kaa ek bhaag maatr he, taare or grahon kii gatividhiyaan, unke swabhaavgat jadtv se utpann hotin hai or unka maarg dik-kaal-satati ke vrittiya tatwon par nirbhar karata he
 Just as there is a magnetic field around the magnet, the celestial object scatters a field in the sky around it
 jis tarah chumbakeey kshetra main ek lohe ke tukade kii gatividhi kshetra kii banaavat se nirdeshit hoti he usee tarah gurutveey kshetra main kisi vastu kaa maarg us kshetra kii jyamithik avasthaa se nirdhaarit hota he
 Einstein's law of gravitation gives information about the regional elements of the time constant
 mukhyat: is niyam kaa ek bhaag gurutvkarshanjanya vastu ke chaaron ore ke kshetra ke dhaanche se sambandh vyakt karata he
 a great proof of Einstein's spreading theory came from seeing the effect of gravity on light
 newton kii bhautikee main siddhant tha ki do vasteen ek-duusare ko donon ke dravyaman ke anusaar khinchati hai
 But there is no mass of light, that is, zero
 to newton ke mutabiq jis chiz kaa koi dravyaman yaa vazan hi nahin uskaa kisi duusari vastu ke gurutvkarshan se khichne kaa sawaal hi nahin banataa chaahe duusari vastu kitni bhi badi kyon na ho
 Light always moves in a straight line
 lekin agar inastin sahi he or kisi badi vastu kii vajah se dik hi mud jaae, to roshni bhi dik ke mudane ke saath mud jaani chahie
 That is, large objects located in the universe should act as lenses - just as the lens of glasses, binoculars or microscope turns light, the stars and planets should also bend
 1924 main ek orest khwolson naam ke roosi bhautikavigyaani ne inastin ke saapekshata siddhant ko samajhakar bhavishyavaanee kii ki aise gurutvkarshak lens brahmand main zarur honge
 Fifty-five years later, this was first noticed in 1979 when two images were seen, instead of one, of an object called twin quasars
 uske baad kaafii dur-daraaj vastuon kii aisi chhaviyaan dekhi ja chuki hai jinamein un vastuon or prithvi ke bich koi bahut badi anya vastu rakhi ho jo pehali vastu se aa rahi prakaash kii kirnon par lenson kaa kaam kare or uski chhavi ko yaa to marod de yaa aasmaan main uski ek se zyaada chhavi dikhaae
 Kafan is a Kathasangraha composed by Premchand
 isamen premchand kii antim kahani kafan ke saath anya 13 kahaniyaan sankalit hai
 Each story included in the book exposes the various perspectives of the human mind, multiple ends of consciousness, social evils and various dimensions of economic oppression with complete artistry
 kafan kahani premchand kii anya kahaniyon se ekadam bhinn he
 His world is completely untouched by his story-world, so it becomes an enigma for those familiar with his stories, imposing a mark on the preconceived notion about Premchand
 yah mulyon ke khandar hi kahani he
 All the issues of modernity are found in it
 yah to aadhuniktaa bodh kii pehali kahani he
 That is why some scholars call it progressivist, so Dr
 Indranath Madan says - The truth which the story reveals does not match the fact of life
 kafan premchand kii jindagi ke us bindu se judi hui kahani he jiske aage koi bindu nahin hota
 According to Dr
 Bachchan Singh - It proved to be not only the shroud of his life but also his accumulated ideals, values, beliefs and beliefs
 jab ki doparamanand shrivastav kaa kahana he ki


 kafan hindi kii sarvapratham nayi kahani he, vah purnatah aadhunik he kyonki usamen na to premchand kaa janaa-pahachaanaa aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad he, na kathanak sambandhi purvavarti dharna he, na gadhe-gadhaaye instrumental jaise paatr hai, na koi parinti, na charamasima, na chhichhli bhavukta or atiranjana or na koi sidhaa sampreshya vastu
 He is a concrete example of the changed outlook of the writer and the changed structure of the story
 iskaa prarambh is prakaar hota he- jhonpade ke dwaar par baap or betaa donon ek buje hue alaav ke saamne chupchaap baithe hue hai or andar bete kii jawan bivi budhiya prasav vednaa pachhad kha rahi thi
 Occasionally, there was such a heart-pounding sound from his mouth that both of them would take hold
 jaadon kii raat thi, prakruti sannaate main dubi hui, sara gaanv andhkaar main lay ho gaya tha
 When Nisang says with a sense that if she does not survive, Madhav angrily answers that if he wants to die then why not die soon - what will he do even after seeing it
 lagata he jaise kahani ke prarambh main hi bade sankethik dhang se premchand ishaara kar rahe hai or bhav kaa andhkaar main lay ho janaa maano poonjeewaadi vyavastha kaa hi pragadh hota hua andhera he jo saare maanviya mulyon, sadbhaav or atmiyata ko rondtha hua nirmam bhav se badhata ja rahaa he
 This woman had given the house an arrangement, by grinding or peeling the grass, she has been looking after both of these non-costs
 or aaj ye donon intjaar main he ki vah mar jaye, to aaraam se soye
 For the father-son who lives on sky, roasted potatoes cost more than that dying woman
 unamem koi bhi is dar se use dekhne nahin janaa chahta ki uske jane par doosraa aadmi saare aalu kha jaayegaa
 The fast they are eating hot potatoes without worrying about burning the pudding and palate makes it easy to estimate their lethal poverty
 yah visangati kahani kii sampurna sanrachana ke saath vidambnaatmak dhang se judi hui he
 Ghisu remembers Thakur's procession of twenty years ago - chutney, raita, three types of dried greens, a roasted tarkari, curd, chutney, sweets
 ab kya bataaun ki us bhoj main kya swaad mila
 


 People ate like this, no water was drunk from anyone
 


 This description is not only very attractive in its details but also makes the textual sensation towards food sharp
 iske baad premchand likhte hai- or budhiya abhi karaah rahi thi
 Thus the description of Thakur's procession helps to solidify inhumanity
 kafan ek aisi saamaajik vyavastha kii kahani he jo shram ke prati aadmi main hatotsaah paidaa karti he kyonki us shram kii koi sarthakata use nahin dikhaayi detii he
 Because in a society in which the condition of day-to-day workers was not much better than their condition and those who knew how to benefit from the weaknesses of the farmers were much more prosperous than the farmers, there was this kind of attitude Being born was not surprising
 


 phir bhi use taksin to thi hi ki agar vah fatehaal he to kam se kam use kisaanon kii-si ji-tod mehnat to nahin kerani padati
 Others do not benefit from his simplicity and carelessness
 bees saal tak yah vyavastha aadmi ko bhar pet bhojan ke bina rakhti he isliye aavashyak nahin ki apane parivaar ke hi ek sadsy ke marane-jeene se zyada chintaa unhen apane pet bharne kii hoti he
 When the woman dies, the shroud of the shuffle begins to change their destiny, at the hand of the shroud, both of them become unanimous that the corpse will be up at night
 raat ko kafan koun dekhtaa he? kafan laash ke saath jal hi to jaataa he
 And then without taking that mild shroud, these people spend the money of that shroud on liquor, betel nut, chutney, pickle and churches
 apane bhojan kii tripti se hi donon budhiya kii sadgati kii kalpana kar lete hai-hamaari aatma prasann ho rahi he to kya use sukh nahin milegaa
 Will definitely get from you
 bhagwaan tum antaryami ho
 Take him to city of god
 apni aatma kii prasannataa pehle jaruri he, sansar or bhagwaan kii prasannataa kii koi jarurat he bhi to baad main
 Gheesu is more intelligent according to his age
 use maaloom he ki log kafan kii vyavastha karenge-bhale hi is baar rupaya unke haath main na aave
nashe kii haalat main madhav jab patni ke athaah dukh bhogane kii sochakar rone lagata he to ghisu use chup karaata he-hamaare paramparaagat gyaan ke sahare ki mar kar vah mukt ho gayi he
 And is left out of this mess
 nashe main naachte-gaate, uchhalte-kudate, sabhi ore se bekhbar or madamast, ve vahiin gir kar dher ho jate hai
 The Janata Dal is a political party in India
 is raajnneetik dal kii upasthiti mukhya rup se bihar or jharkhand main he
 
 The Janata Dal was formed on 30 October 2003 after the merger of Janata Dal's Sharad Yadav faction, Lokshakti Party and Samata Party
 jedy ab bhartiya janata party ke netritv main gathit rashtriya loktantric gathbandhan kaa ghatak dal he
 In the 1999 general election, a Janata Dal faction led by then Karnataka Chief Minister JH Patel supported the National Democratic Alliance
 iske baad janata dal do hisson main bant gaya
 The first faction separated Khid as Janata Dal under the leadership of HD Deve Gowda while the second faction came into existence under the leadership of Sharad Yadav
 baad main janata dal kaa sharad yadav gut, lokshakti party or samta party paas aae or 30 oktober 2003 ko aapas main vilay kar janata dal naam se ek nai party kaa gathan kiya
 The election symbol of this party was arrow and the flag was registered in green-white color
 baad ke dinon main jediu rashtriya loktantric gathbandhan main shaamil ho gai jiske baad jediu or bijepi gathbandhan ne 2005 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav main rashtriya janata dal ke netritv main sanyukt pargatisheel gathbandhan kii sarkaar ko haraa diya
 a new government was formed in Bihar under the leadership of Nitish Kumar
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main is gathbandhan ko bihar main 32 siten mili
 In which BJP got success in 12 seats while JDU won 20 seats
 to vahiin 2010 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav main jediu ko 115 siten or bijepi ko 91 siten praapt huin
 Thus, both parties won a total of 206 seats in the 243-member Bihar Assembly and once again the government was formed under the leadership of Nitish Kumar
 2014 ke aam chunaav main bijepi dwaara narendra modi ko chunaav prachaar cameti kaa pramukh banaae jane ke virodh main jediu ne bihar main bijepi ke saath 17 saal puraane apane gathbandhan ko samaapt kar diya
 After this Sharad Yadav left the post of NDA convenor
 lok sabha chunaav manen jediu ne bhartiya communist party ke saath milakar chunaav ladaa lekin use us chunaav main bihar kii kul chalis lok sabha siton main se sirf do siton par hi safalataa mil pai
 So there BJP and its allies got success in 32 seats
 lok sabha chunaav main mili asafalataa ke baad nitish kumaar ne mukhyamantri ke pad se tyaagptr de diya or jithan ram maanjhi nae mukhyamantri bane
 When BJP demanded this government to prove majority in the House, RJD supported JDU and saved this government from falling
 14 april 2015 ko jediu, rashtriya janata dal, samaajawaadee party, samaajawaadee janata party or indian neshnal lokdal ke netaaon ne ghoshnaa kii ki wo samprag se baahar janata parivaar gathjod banaakar bijepi kaa virodh karenge
 But the Samajwadi Party denied the alliance with the seat synergy
 2014 ke loksabhaa main mili asafalataa ke baad jediu or argedy kareeb aae 2015 ke bihar vidhansabha chunaav main jediu, argedy or congress ne milakar endie ke khilaaf mahagathbandhan kaa elaan kiya
 The alliance won 178 seats in the election and Nitish Kumar once again took charge as the Chief Minister of Bihar
 26 july 2017 ko nitish kumaar ne bihar ke mukhyamantri ke pad se istipha dete hue 20 maheene puraane mahagathbandhan ke ant kaa elaan kar diya
 The next day, he took oath as Chief Minister of Bihar again with the support of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 28 july 2017 ko bihar kii endie sarkaar ne bidhan sabha main 108 ke mukaable 131 voton ke jariye apana bahumat siddh kar liya

e
 from 1929 to 1948 and death remained the same time after Friday
 hamaare visheshgy itihaas ausajya ne maadar millat ko kaayade ajam ke ghar kii dekhbhaal karne vaali bahan ko lekar bahut buland sthaan diya he lekin unhone sthapana pakistan or khaskar 1965 ke baad ke raajnneetik nakshe par jo ascharyajanak prabhaav chode hai unki taraf adhik dhyaan nahin
 It is a worthwhile thing that in the life of quaid-e-azam, Mater Millat his Hummer uh should live effectively for 19 years i
e
 from 1929 to 1948 and death remained the same time after Friday i
e
 from 1946 to 1967 but in this second phase his own Individuals emerged in such a way and their thoughts and roles came out in such a way that they were able to play the life of quaid-e-azam to save the democratic and transparent political values
 Credit can be given that had forgotten ruler
 is silsile main maadar millat ne jin aara jataai unase samakaleen raajnneetishastra or maamalon par unki zahani pakad naa yogya vishwaas had tak or majboot najar aati he
 In response to the criticism of Job Khan on the occasion of the Presidential election of 1965, Mather Milat himself said that Job can be an expert in military affairs, but political understanding and i have got quaid-e-azam directly and this is an area in which Amar absolutely no longitude is
 1965 ke baad utpann hone vaali ghatnaon madarmalat ke is bayaan kii pushti karne ke liye kaaphi hai
 Some of the dangers identified repeatedly by Mather Miltat, for example, are: madarmalat ne noi anya rashtriya or antarrashtriya maamalon ke barse main sahebaan satta or janata koane vaale khataron se aagaah karne vaale jo vivaran die vah unki dur ras nigahon or raajnneetik doordarshee kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 If we would have listened to Ni Maadar Milat's vision and organized to avoid the dangers that were clearly watching, we would not have been in the grip of radical political, economic and social outlays that would make our nation night and The day is facing up and it seems certain that the Dalkhrash incident site of East Pakistan would not have been developing
 maadar millat raajnneetik jivan chaahe unhone jis andaaz se raat or din bitaye or raashtra or musalamaanon ke liye jo balidaan karen unke andar nishchay ek adarsh bhoomika ke puure karkon hai
 Five of these factors are particularly notable: First: she was an ideal Garillo woman
 vyarth kharachi se puraa parhez or saral lekin aavashyak asishon or suvidhaon se bharpoor ghar 'kaayade ajam ke liye bhojan or aaraam kaa ek pranali alaav kaat' saitiya chahal pahal or malakatyon ke bheed ke ba vajood par aaraam maahaul 'kaayade ajam apni gir mayon ke ant main jab ghar lautate to apane swaagat ke liye ek khandaan or shaadaan bahan ko maujuud pate
 This was the satisfying and peaceful Indigenous atmosphere in which, despite his illness, quaid-e-azam was able to achieve the full success and movement of Pakistan with a needle
 do: maadar millat jivan se ek mahatvapurn sabak yah miltaa he ki mahilaon ko pro feshnal shiksha aa rasta honachahe taaki vah aarthik rup se aatmanirbhar hai or rashtriya aay main bhi vruddhi kar saken
 Mather Millat received a crush on the dentist and spent many years working on it and giving free treatment to the poor during this period
 swayamsevak: madarmalat apane jivan kaa lagbhag hissaa beshumaar saamaajik or rafahi santhaan sir sati keval or unki pragati or vikaas main daame, orame 'sakhane madad kii lekar kashmiri apravasiyon ke liye sevaaon naa yogya fra mosh hai
 Fourth: The most important achievement of Madar Miltat is to make Pakistan walk on the path of democracy
 She participated in the 1965 presidential election by refreshing memories of the movement Pakistan's public substance and the feelings of a juggling and passion between East and West Pakistan
 Made aware haalanki unhen dhaandhlee se haraaya gaya lekin iskaa nateeja kuch saalon ke andar ayyub khan kii sainya shaasha ke ant ke rup main niklaa
 The message for the women of Pakistan in the political struggle is that it should not be related to political science

 It is the duty of women and especially girls to study the hyatt and services of the dear sister of quaid-e-azam and inculcate within them at least the qualities mentioned above
 inhen visheshtaon kii badaulat mahilaon raashtra vikaas or nirmaan main bharpoor andaaz main yogadan kar sakati hai
 Madre Irani a study of some new Afroz views: Madre Milat's Hyatt and Services shows that Pakistan had a clear idea about the construction and development and development policies of society
 jaisaa ki pehle bhi kaha gaya he unhen keval ek gharelu mahila samajhnaa sahi nahin hoga
 She lived for 19 years after the death of quaid-e-azam and offered her prayers with Tawatur about the political, economic, social and educational problems of the country

 quaid-e-azam was not present to guide these thoughts and statements
 maadar millat apane liye pustaken biniya or adhyayan kii behad shaukeen thim or vibhinn maamalon main swatantra dhang se sochati thim
 No analytics writing has been seen yet about his thoughts and opinions
 yahan namoonay ke rup main unke chaar bayanon darj kiye jate hai jo samasyaon kii fikri pakad kaa pataa chalata he: Islamic teachings: At this time the world is going through a strange phase and it is difficult to say what will be the result of the struggle
 At this time, the biggest problem that has been a pain for the whole world is that how did noi become a human being and established equality and equality 





 kashmir: tab pakistan ko vibhinn muddon kaa saamana he or yah siddh amar he ki inamen kashmir sabase mahatvapurn he
 From the point of view, Kashmir holds the life and soul of Pakistan
 aarthik lihaaz se kashmir hamaari marafi samay strot he
 Pakistan's big rivers would pass through the border of the same state and enter Pakistan and give it to our well-being, without it Pakistan's time would be in danger
 agar khuda na kare ham kashmir se vanchit hone par prakruti kii di gai nemat pad kaa bada hissaa hamase chhin jayega
 Kashmir is the main point of our trouble
 agar dushman kashmir sundarat ghati or pahaado main morcha banane kaa mauka mil jaae to phir yah atal amar he ki hamaare maamalon main hastkshep or custom chalaane kii koshish karegaa
 So in order to make ourselves a strong and truly powerful nation, it is very important that Pakistan should not be caught in the grip of such enemy activities
 In this context, our first duty of Kashmir becomes
 aantarik sthirataa: aaj sthiti kya he? aantarik rup se ham uddeshy prakriya ke gathbandhan se vanchit hai bahari taur par hamen vah sammaan or aadar nahin jiske ham yogya hai
 You wonder nafs and think on who is his responsibility, certainly you do not present the hurdles that were presented before the freedom compared to the two great powerful, because it is because you have failed to produce the leadership that has so far Support of ideas and equality from Delhi? What is the reason that you have understood the meaning of freedom as comfort and ease rather than hard work and struggle? Is it because of your Enemies are given the opportunity he was creating chaos Sfon of retrievable in disguise friends Krenaor Pakistan came into existence Smjrjh you Bhkaaajn these ideas
 ye aise prashn hai jinka uttar khud aap ko dena chahie
 Nowadays big things are happening here on foreign policy and foreign affairs, but i am of the opinion that the truth is very little interference in these things
 sabase swaagat he ki ham sthiti ko sadhaarein, agrahako mat ko raajnneetik or aarthik sthirataa praapt ho jaae to use videsh bhi sammaan naseeb hoti he
 His foreign policy may or may not be liked by anyone but is seen with respect

 Dulah is a poet of recital
 ramchandra shukla ne inkaa kavitaakaal sanwat 1804 se san

 The discovery of the Nagri Prapharini Sabha has revealed that the only available Alankar Granth, 'kavikul Kanthabharan' is composed in 1807
 'shivsingh saroj' ke parishisht bhaag ke kaviyon ke jeevancharitra main granthgat samay kaa khandan karte hue kaha gaya he, 'inkaa janm san
 1803 galat hai
 Because the birth of his father Kavindra is given in 1804 in this book

 'these things are based on conjecture only

 He was the grandson of poet Kalidas Trivedi and son of Udayanath Trivedi 'kavindra'
 'kavikul kanthabharan' ke atirikt inkaa koi doosraa kavyagranth nahin miltaa; thodi si footkal kavitaayen hi milti hai, jo inaki kisi kavita-pustak kii avshesh hongi
 His Kavikul Kantabharan has been composed for ornamentation
 jis prakaar sanskrit main alankaar ke navabhyasiyon ke liye appay dikshit kaa 'kuvalayanand' sarvottam mana jaataa rahaa he, usee prakaar hindi main maharaj jaswant singh kaa 'bhashaabhushan' or kaviver matiram kaa 'lalit lalaam' ye donon pustaken samaadrut rahi hai
 Following the method of Kuvalayananda, in Bhasha Bhushan, examples are given in half of the couplets and examples in half
 matiram or dulah kii paddati usase bhinn he
 Dulah gave the signs and examples of ornamentation in a single verse but chose large verses like Kavitta and Savaiya for him
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki adhik avkaash mil jane ke kaaran lakshan or udhaaharan ko samajhane ke liye dohe kii apeksha adhik suvidha ho gai or bade chhandon ke naadasaundarya ke kaaran unhen yaad karne kii kathinaayee bhi jaati rahi
 In Hindi Acharyas, they are definitely influenced by the poetess of Mahakavi Keshavdas, but Kuvalayananda's influence on them is more visible
 kuvalayanand main kul 123 alankaar gruhit hue hai
 115 figures of speech are described in 'kavikul Kanthabharan'
 kuvalayanand kii hi bhanti isamen bhi shabdalankaron kaa ullekh nahin hua he
 They take special care to distinguish the ornaments
 is granth ke aarambh main dulah ne isaki visheshta or isaki rachana kaa uddeshy spasht kiya he
 According to the larger history of Hindi literature, certain other literary facts have been derived from his couplet, 'dulah has indicated the three classes of literatures of this era using the words' Satakavi', 'kartar' and 'alankriti'
 satkavi se anek angon kaa ekatra vivechan karanevaale aacharyon das, dev aadi; karta se reeti ke aashray se varnan karanevaale kavi matiram, bhushan aadi tathaa alankriti se alankaar vishay ke gyaata or lekhak jasamvat singh, dulah aadi kaa arth liya ja saktaa he
 ' hindi ke alankarik acharya anshat: brajabhasha kii adhyakshata or anshat: dohe jaise chote chand ke chunaav ke kaaran alankaar ke bhedon kaa antar spasht nahin kar sake hai
 But Dulah adopted the best method for this, that he gave examples of all the distinctions of a figure in a single sentence
 kahin kahin adhyetaon ke liye kathinaayee vahaan upasthit ho jaati he jahaan unhone ek hi chand ke aadhe bhaag main ek alankaar kaa lakshan tathaa udhaaharan or aadhe bhaag main duusare kaa lakshan tathaa udhaaharan rakh diya he; kintu kul milakar reetikalin alankaar granthon main sabhi drushtiyon se yah pustak adwitiya he
 Although his footbal verses are found only 15-20, however, some people count them in the category of Dev, Padmakar and Matiram due to the seriousness of the expressions, the elegance of the imagination and the intensity of the language
