 Overloading water helps suppress depression
 falat: uttarottar varsha rituon main aae hue avsaad pehle aae hue avsaadon se ekadam mishrit nahin hote, apitu pruthak pruthak starikaon main sanchit hote hai
 This action is called leveling
 pratyek starika kii motaai ek varsha ritu main aae hue avsaad kii maatra par nirbhar hogi
 On average it ranges from 2 to 4 millimeters
 yadi avsaad kaa nickshepan kai varshon tak satat hota rahe, to spashtatya patali patali starikaon main sthaan par kuch mote staron main avsaad sanchit hoga or in staron kii motaai avsaad aane kii gati evam us avadhi par nirbhar hogi jisamen avsaad kaa nickshepan aviraam hota rahe
 The velocity of drift and the stability of direction also have an effect on the arrangement of particles of sediment accumulated in levels
 maheen mitti or maheen baaluu ke kan jal main bahut der tak nilambit rahete hai or bahut hi shanai: shanai: tah main baithte hai
 Their deposition also occurs in relatively deep water, where the edge is completely relaxed
 aisi avasthaa main kanon ke sanchit hone kii vyavastha nirantar ek si bani rahati he or str suvyavasthti or niyamit banate hai
 The particles get enough time to freeze and the levels continue to be parallel to the sea
 iske vipareet moti baaluu or bajri ityadi ke sanchit hone kaa sthaan apekshaakrit chhichhlaa hota he
 In such places the speed of the torrent is often variable, sometimes slow and sometimes rapid
 mand avasthaa main sanchit avsaad kaa upree bhaag, teevr gati kii avasthaa main aparidit hokar bahane lagata he or jahaan dhar mand ho vahaan pun: nickshepan ho jaataa he
 Thus the deposited material is not parallel to the first layer
 iske atirikt chhichley pani main, jahaan in mote kanon kaa nickshepan hota he, bahudhaa dhar kii disha bhi badalati rahati he
 This change happens due to tides and strong wind etc
 at: dhar kii disha ke saath saath avsaadeey staron kii disha bhi sthaniyat: badalati rahati he
 Thus the levels of sedimentary rocks accumulated in shallow water are often not parallel to each other, whose angles may vary from place to place
 is ghatana ko abhaasi sanstaran kehete hai
 Sometimes there is a situation in depression areas that the imprint of water waves also gets printed in the depressive levels
 chhichley pradeshon main, vishashakar jowarbhatantar katibandh main, tarangon kaa veg itnaa adhik haata he ki vahaan nickshepit baaluu or mitti unke sanketon par naachati phirti hai or bahudhaa unhen bhi tarang rup de detii hai
 Before the arrival of new depression, if this ripple sand gets an opportunity to dry up and get some strength, then this wave form remains safe
 bhaate kii avasthaa main avsaad ko sookhne evam ddadh ho jane kaa avasar bahudhaa mil jaataa he
 Similarly, the footprints of crabs, insects, and other animals can also be protected in the depression accumulated in the tidal zone
 kabhi kabhi varshajal kii boondon se bane aghatchinh bhi in avsaadon main surakshit ho jate hai
 After the death of various types of flaky animals living in the sea, their scales start accumulating in the sea
 tarangon ke pravaah se bahudhaa ye shalk idhar udhar ludhakte rahete hai, jisase kalantar main ve tuutakar chur ho jate hai or nadi dwaara laai hui baaluu or mitti main mil jate hai
 Most of the flakes are made of calcium carbonate and thus calcium solids, sand and clay are formed
 shuddh mitti, athwa baaluu, ke str keval unheen sthanon main sanchit ho pate hai jahaan shalkadhari jeev praaia: anupasthit hon
 Sometimes the flakes are buried in depression before they break down and in that state they become safe as they are
 is prakaar surakshit shalkon ko jeevashm kehete hai
 In the deepest parts of the sea, where the sand and mud depressions brought by the river do not reach, a pure depression of the powder of shields is deposited, the amount of which can become very abundant over time
 is prakaar baaluu ke str chhichley pani main, mitti ke str apekshaakrit kuch gahare pani main or chooneydaar avsaad ke shail adhik gahare samudri bhaagon main sanchit hote hai
 In arid and temperate countries, watering occurs in abundance
 in pradeshon main yadi koi aisi jhil ho jisamen nadiyon evam varshavah dwaara laae hue jalan kii maatra bhaap banakar ud janevaale jal kii apeksha kam ho, to vah jhil shanai: shanai: sookhne lagati he or kalantar main purnataya vinasht ho ja sakati he
 Generally, some salts dissolve in the water and rainwater of the rivers
 at: jhil main nadiyon dwaara nity prati nayaa lavan padaarth aata rahata he
 The water evaporates due to the heat, but the salt is left behind
 at: jhil kaa pani uttarottar adhik lavniya athwa khaaraa hota jaataa he
 Over time, the salt may accumulate in such a large amount that the lake water becomes saturated with it
 isse adhik vaashpan se lavan avakshipt hone lagegaa, jisase avsaad lavniya ho jayega
 If the amount of sediment brought by rivers at the time of precipitation of salt is very low, pure salt levels can usually precipitate
 tibet kii anekon jhilein is kriya kii udhaaharan hai
 There is very little rainfall, due to which the lakes are getting progressively drier and the saline levels are precipitating in their layers
 pakistan ke sault ranj parvat main, khevda ke pradesh main sandha namak tathaa jipsom ke nikshep isi prakaar kisi pracheen sagar kii shakha ke sookhne se bane honge
 Similarly, due to the action of various natural agents, the erosion and erosion of the geomorphic rocks is being sustained and the depression arising from it is finally accumulating in the trough of the sea
 jyon jyon avsaad ke staron main vruddhi hoti he, nichevale staron ke upar nae aae hue padaarth kii daab badhati jaati he
 Often the pressure of sedimentary levels of 300 m thick is 80 kg per square centimeter
 at: keval 60 meter mute staron ke sanchit hone par, sabase neeche ke staron par praaia: 13 kilogram prati varg centimetre kii daab padane lagegi
 The water pressure of the reservoir is also not reduced
 prati ek meter pani kii daab 100 gram prati varg centimetre hoti he
 Due to the effect of all these pressures, the properties of depression come close together and intertwine with each other
 inke bich kaa pani nikal jaataa he or ve shushkpraay ho jate hai
 Thin, thin membranes of water can still stick to the particles and their stress helps to keep the particles interconnected
 jalaashyon athwa aantarbhom jal main saadharantaya kuch na kuch lavan villin hote hai1 jab yah jal risataa hua avsaad main se bahata he, to kuch vibhinn kaarnon se isamen kaa kuch lavan avsaad ke kanon ke bich main avakshepit hokar, uske mukt kanon ko aapas main ddadh rup se sanyojit kar detaa he or avsaad kathor, subaddh pashaan main parivartit ho jaataa he
 Calcium carbonate, iron oxide, and silica are particularly notable among the salts used in combination
 inamen se silica kaa bandhan sabase suddadh hota he
 The type of stone formed in this way will depend on the substance of depression
 yatha baaluu ke avsaad se bana shail athwa shell, batiyon ke samooh ke sangyojan se sangutikashm ityadi banenge
 If there is a little sand in the soil, sandy rocks etc
 will form
 samudr vaa anya jalaashyon main avsaad staron athwa pararto main shanai: shanai: sanchit hota he
 The particles of depression are compressed due to their compression due to pressure and with the help of some salts and other bases
 is kriya main bhi avsaad kaa starabhav bana rahata he
 Due to depression, they are also called sedimentary rocks
 avsaadeey shail padaarth samudr athwa anya jalaashyon kii tah main bahut kaal tak sanchit hota rahata he
 In due course of time, due to the effect of a circle etc
, it can rise from the bottom of the ocean, take the form of a mountain and become part of the continent
 yah ek pralayakari parivartan hota he
 This causes the sedimentary material to form the backdrop of the action of the natural agents and, under their influence, decaying again gives rise to new depressions, which begin to deposit at the bottom of the then ocean
 is prakaar bhuprishth kaa padaarth ninratar ek avsaadeey chakra main bhaag letaa rahata he
 At the end of each cycle, the ocean and continents are reestablished and new land and water bodies are formed in them

 Thousands of devotees throng to it
 saakshyon ke anusaar yah mela chandel shaasha parimardidev ke samay armbh hua tha, jo aaj tak lagata aa rahaa he
 The first mention of this Kalinjar festival is found in the drama metaphor Shatakam composed by Parimardev's minister and playwright Vatsaraj
 unke shasankaal main har varsh mantri vatsaraj ke do naatakon kaa manchan isi mahotsav ke avasar par kiya jaataa tha
 Later, during the time of Madanavarman, the dance programs of a dancer named Padmavati are also mentioned in the history of Kalinjar
 uskaa nrity us samay mahotsav kaa mukhya aakarshan hua karata tha
 This tradition has been going on for a thousand years even today as a Katki fair, in which millions of people from different regions come here and bathe in various ponds and get a reward by seeing Neelkantheshwar Mahadev

 The Kartik, or Katki Mela, on the banks of the Ganges River in Bithoor on the day of Kartik Purnima, is famous all over North India since ancient times
 kanpur shahar se 15 kilometre dur ganga tat par sthit bithur vaise to har saal dharmik lihaaj se shraddhaluon ke aakarshan kaa centre rahata he, lekin karthik poornima ke din yahaan bada mela lagata he
 The battle of Naulakha defeat started in the fair lasting three days here, which later became a silent witness to the historical battle between the Chandela dynasty of Mahoba
 jambudweep ke arntagat bharatkhand ke aryaavart pradesh main maa ganga or yamuna jaisi paavan nadiyon ke doaab main sthit bithur kaa karthik mela ek aitihaasik yuddh kaa bhi gavaah he
 It is said that in the second half of the 12th century, during the Kartik Purnima, the Maharaja of all fours started preparing for the Bithur Fair, then Karinga, the son of Raja Jambhi of Mandavgarh, also went to the fair of Bithoor
 tab uski bahan ne manuhaarpurn vaani main usase kaha ki bhai hamaare liye meley se koi anmol vastu jarur le aana
 Karinga, with a promise to his sister, traveled with his small army to the Bithoor fair
 bithur ke kataki meley main mahoba ke chandel raja parmardi dev kii rani malana devi bhi apni bahan ke saath ai thi
 The boundary of Bithoor was then five kos

 The sons of these Daksharaj were Alha and Udal
 dakshraj kii patni devladevi ko uski choti bahan malanadevi ne naulakha haar uphaar main diya tha
 Wearing the same necklace, Devla Devi came to the fair on Kartik Purnima of Bithoor
 malanadevi ke gale main haar dekhakar karinga kaa man dol gaya usne rani kii sena par hamalaa bol diya
 When he snatches the queen's necklace, then Talan Syed of Banarasgaon, Gorakhpur, hearing the noise, challenged his soldiers, the soldiers drove Karinga
 rani ne syed ko apana dharm bhai bana liya
 Humiliated Karinga again stormed into Daspur at night and snatched the queen's necklace

 In Buddhism, the state of 'fullness' or exaltation of certain qualities is called Paramita or Parami
 buddha dharm main in gunon kaa vikaas pavitrataa kii prapti, karm ko pavitra karne aadi ke liye kii jaati he taaki sadhak anavaruddh jivan jite hue bhi gyaan kii prapti kar sake
 The word 'paramita' is derived from 'param'
 chah parmita : mahayan granthon main chah parmita kii gananaa milti he- The following four Paramitas are also counted in the Dasabhumikasutra - das parmita : therwaad granthon main das parmita varnit hai- a load hanging from a peg is called a pendulum, which can swing freely back and forth
 jhula iskaa ek vyaavhaarik udhaaharan he
 The pendulum oscillates and returns again after any point, it is called its 'periodic'
 yadi lolak kaa aayam kam ho to iskaa aavartkaal aayam par nirbhar nahin karata balki keval lolak kii lambaai or gurutvajanit twaran ke sthaneey maan par nirbhar hota he
 The periodicity of the pendulum also does not depend on the mass of the pendulum
 jahaan l lolak kii lambaai he, tathaa g us sthaan par gurutvajanit twaran kaa maan he
 It is clear from this formula that if the amplitude is low, the periodicity will be the same for different dimensions
 lolak ke is gun ko 'samakalikta' kehete hai
 Due to its quality, pendulum is used in timeliness

 One of the earliest mentions of Brahma with Vishnu and Shiva is in the fifth text of the Maitrayani Upanishad, written in the first millennium BCE
 brahma kaa ullekh pehle kutchyna stotra kehalaae jane vaale chand 5
1 main he
 Then verse 5
2 explains this
 sarveshwaravaadi kutchyna stotra kahata he ki hamaari aatma brahman he or yah param satya yaa ishwar sabhi praaniyon ke bheetar maujuud he
 It equates the soul with Brahma and his other manifestations in this way: You are Brahma, you are Vishnu, you are Rudra, you are Agni, Varuna, Vayu, Indra, you are all
 chand 5
2 main vishnu or shiv kii tulana gun kii sankalpana se kii gai he
 It states that the qualities, psyche and innate tendencies described in the text occur in all beings
 maitri upanishad kaa yah adhyay daawa karata he ki brahmand andhkaar se ubhara he
 What first emerged as an impulse but later changed into purity and goodness
 phir yah brahma kii tulana rajas se is prakaar karata he: Then the part of it that is tamas is Rudra, the students of sacred knowledge
 uskaa wo bhaag jo rajas he, he pavitra gyaan ke vidhyaarthiyon, brahma he
 The part of it that is Sattva is Vishnu, the students of sacred knowledge
 vastav main wo ek tha, wo teen ban gaya, aath, gyaarah, baarah or asankhya ban gaya
 It came inside everyone, he became the master of it all
 yahi aatma he, bheetar or baahar, haan bheetar or baahar
 Although the Maitri Upanishad compares Brahma to an element of the virtue principle of Hinduism, it does not call them part of the trinity
 trimurti kaa ullekh baad ke puranic sahitya main miltaa he
 Many times in the Bhagavata Purana it is said that Brahma is the one who emerges from the "ocean of causes"
 
 yah puraana kahata he ki jis kshan samay or brahmand kaa janm hua tha, usee kshan brahma hari kii naabhi se nikle ek camel ke pushp se ubhare the
 This Purana states that Brahma is in sleep, committing mistake and he was temporarily incapable of creating the universe
 jab ve apni bhranti or nidra se avgat hue to unhone ek tapasvi kii tarah tapasya kii, hari ko apane hriday main apana liya, phir unhen brahmand ke aarambh or ant kaa gyaan ho gaya, or phir unki rachanaatmak shaktiyaan punerjeevit ho gayi
 The Bhagavata Purana states that after this he created a variety of dazzling creatures by combining nature and man
 bhagwat puraana maaya ke srijan ko bhi brahma kaa kaam bataata he
 He created it only for creation
 maaya se sab kuch achchhai or buraai, padaarth or aadhyatm, aarambh or ant se rang gaya

 Belief in Islamic theology refers to a believer's belief in the spiritual aspects of Islamic theology
 isaki sabase saral paribhaasha vishwaas ke chah lekhon main vishwaas he, jise "arkan al-imaan" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 It means faith in the six themes of Islam's faith
 imaan shabd quran or haddees-e-jibril donon main chitrit kiya gaya he
 According to the Quran, Imaan must be accompanied by religious deeds and the two together are necessary for entry into heaven
 jibril kii haddees main, islamic dharm ke ayaamon kaa nirmaan yah teen karte hai "islam" "ihasaan" or "imaan"
 Within and outside Islam, religion is discussed for faith and purpose, and the relative importance of both cannot be forgotten
 kai vidwaanon kaa tark he ki ek hi strot or jagah se vishwaas or hetu donon utpann hote hai isliye donon ko saamanjasypurna hona chahie
 In Arabic, Iman, the pronunciation means "faith"
 yah kriya sangya he, آمن, matlab kisi chiz main vishvas rakhana
 In the Hadith, Muhammad Sahib defined as "the meaning of Iman - wisdom in the heart, voice on the tongue, and activity in the hands and feet"
 vishwaas ek bharosa he sachai par jo vaastavik he
 When people believe, they attach themselves to that truth
 sachai jaananaa hi kaaphi nahin he, dil use maananaa bhi chahie, jeebh dwaara vyakt kii jaani chahie jo buddhi kii abhivyakti he or ant main unke aatmavishvaas ko pratibimbit karne ke liye us kaa amal karnaa bhi zaruri he
 Hamiduddin Farahi, in his tafsir, explaining the meaning of Iman, wrote: vishwaas aam taur par vishwaas ke chah lekhon kaa upyog karke ullikhit he: The first of these is mentioned by the Qur'an and the first five by Muhammad, while a doctrine of belief in Allah - the good and the bad of God-ordered destiny - refers to all six in the following way in the Hadith of Gabriel: mohammad se bhi ek or samaan varnan he: "ibn Abbas narrated that Malak Jibril once asked the Prophet:" Tell me what is Iman? "the Prophet replied:" Iman is to believe in Allah, on the Day of Judgment, on His Malaika, books and prophets, And to believe in life after death, and to believe in heaven and hell, and on the establishment of the Mizan which is to weigh our karma, and believe in destiny, on its good and evil
 jibril ne phir un se poocha: "yadi main yah sab karata hum to main imaan ke saath rahoonga?" paigambar ne kaha: " jab aapane yah sab kiya he, to aap imaan main honge
 " yah bhi mana jaataa he ki aavashyak imaan main pehle 3 chize hoti hai 
 In the Quran, one of the 10 virtues is Imaan which one gets due to becoming the recipient of Allah's mercy and reward
 quran kahata he ki vishwaas allaah ke samaran ke saath bad saktaa he
 The Quran also says that in this world there should be nothing but faith that is dear to Momin
 mohammad ne kaha he ki; usne vishwaas kii mithaas praapt kii jo allaah ko ishwar islam ko dharm or mohammad ko paigambar ke rup main sweekaar kiya
 He also said that no one can be a true believer until he loves the Prophet more than his children, parents and relatives
 ek or udhaaharan main, unhone tippanee kii he ki yah allaah or mohammad ke saath prem karne ke baad hi ek vyakti vishwaas ke asli swaad se avgat ho saktaa he
 Amin Ahsan Islahi, one of the Quran's emissaries, has clarified the nature meaning of this love: 

prem keval kisi kii patni, bacchon or anya rishtedaaron ke liye swaabhaavik rup se bhavuk pyaar kaa sanket nahin detaa he, balki yah kuch drushtikon or buddhi or siddhanton ke aadhaar par prem ko bhi sanderbhit karata he
 It is because of this love that a person, in every sphere of life, gives priority to this attitude and principle
 agar vyakti apanai patni, bacchon or rishtedaaron kii maang is drushtikon kii maangon se juujhati he, to vah bina kisi hichkhichahat ke is kaa paalan karata he, isi imaani prem ke kaaran uski patni or bacchon kii ichchhaaon or unke parivaar or kabeeley kii maangon ko kam kar detaa he
 Both Islahi and Maududi have speculated that the Quran's comparison of a good word and a bad word in chapter 14 is actually a comparison of faith and unbelief
 is prakaar, quran prabhavi rup se ek ped par vishwaas kii tulana kar rahaa he jisaki jaden mitti main gahari hai or akaash kii vishalata main shakhaaen faili hui hai
 There is also the subject of a prayer made by Iman Muhammad to Allah: he allaah! maine apane aap ko thukraayaa he or khud ko aap ke hawaale saunp diya he, or main ne aapaki badhaai pahchaan kar pehle aapke sharan main aagaya hoon, aap se bhaag kar kahin bhi sharan milane vaala nahin he
 If you are with anyone then prabhu! maine aapaki pustak main vishwaas kiya he jise aapane prakat kiya he or paigambar main vishwaas kiya he jise aapane paigambaron ke rup main bheja he
 Imam al-behiqi has compiled in his book Shu'ab al-iman that there are 77 branches of faith
 isamen, vah imaan ke aavashyak gunon ko samajhaate huve kurani aaayaaton or nabi kii hadison kaa ullekh kiya he, jo vishvas ko darshaate hai
 The following hadith is based on Muhammad Sahib: abu huraira ne suna he ki paigambar ne kaha tha: "imaan main 70 se adhik shakhaaen hai
 The most excellent of these branches is to read "la Ilaha Ilallah", and the shortest branch is to remove the obstacle read in the way
 or haya imaan kii ek mahatvapurn shakha he
 " islam main, yah aavashyak he ki vishwaas or karmon ke bich sadbhaav or samanvay maujuud ho
 Farahi has explained this aspect in his tafsir in the following way: vishwaas ke baad quran main dharmik karmon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he 


 vishwaas ke maamle main, isaki vyakhya kii aavashyaktaa spasht he: vishwaas kii jagah dil or buddhi he
 In matters of intelligence and heart, not only can a person deceive others but sometimes he himself can be deceived
 vah khud ko ek mumin maanata he jabaki vastav main vah nahin he
 For this reason, it requires two evidences: a person's words and a person's deeds
 chunki shabd asaty ho sakate hai, isliye ek vyakti jo keval shabdon ke madhyam se vishwaas kaa daawa karata he use muman ke rup main nahin mana jaataa he or ise aavashyak samajha jaataa tha ki ek vyakti ke karm bhi uske vishwaas kii gavaahi den
 Thus the Quran said: o you believe with the tongue! Trust through your actions
 islam main tark or vishwaas ke bich sambandh sadiyon se faili ek jatil bahes he
 Ismail Raji al-farooqi explains on this subject: gaiyr-musalmaan islam ke siddhanton kaa virodh kar sakate hai
 However, they should be aware that Islam does not offer its doctrines specifically to those who believe or want to believe
 islam is ko tarksangat rup se, tarksangat rup se pesh karata karata he
 It introduces us to the necessary grounds with logical and consistent arguments
 vyaktigat swaad, yaa vyaktiparak anubhav ke saapeksh aadhaar par asahmat hona hamaare liye vaid nahin he
 In linguistics, the study of sign processes, or expression and communication, signs and symbols is called signology
 ise aam taur par nimnlikhit teen shakhaon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he: Semiotics is often seen with important anthropological dimensions; For example, Umberto Eco proposes that every cultural phenomenon can be studied as communication
 tathaapi, kuch lakshanshasthri vigyaan ke taarkik ayaamon par dhyaan kendrit karte hai
 They also investigate fields related to natural science — such as how organisms can predict and adapt to their symbolic karma status in the world
 In general, semiotic theories take signs or signaling systems as their objective of study: the communication of information in living beings is covered in biosemiotics or zoologics
 vaakya-vigyaan lakshaniki kii shakha he, jo sanketon or pratikon kii aupchaarik visheshtaon ke saath sambandh rakhti he
 Actually, syntax "deals with the rules that govern how words are combined to form phrases and sentences
" Charles Morris states that semantics is concerned with the relation of signs to their instructions and the relationships they can or do represent with objects; And utilitarianism deals with the biotic aspects of semiotics, that is, all psychological, biological or social phenomena that occur in the action of signs
 shabd, jise angrezi main semeiotics likhaa jaataa he, pehali baar henry stabs dwaara sanketon ke pratipaadan se sambandhit chikitsa vigyaan kii shakha ko nirupit karne ke sunishchit arth main prayukt hua tha
 John Locke used the words semeiotike and semeiotics in book 4, chapter 21 of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding
 isamen ve bataate hai ki kaise vigyaan ko teen bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he: Locke then elaborates on this third category of nature, naming it Σημειωτικη and explaining it as the "principle of signs" in the following words: unnisvin sadi main, charles sanders piers ne paribhaashit kiya, jise unhone "semiotic" kaha jo "sanketon kaa ardh-aavashyak, yaa aupchaarik siddhant he", jiskaa saar he "


 dwaara prayukt sabhi sanketon ke varna kya hone chahie, jise buddhi anubhav dwaara seekhney main sakasham hai" or jo sanket or sanket prakriya ke anusaar darshanik tark kaa anusaran karata he
 Charles Morris followed Pierce in using the term "semiotic" and expanded it from human communication to animal learning and use of signs
 tathaapi ferdinand de loshuar ne lakshan-vigyaan ke andar atyadhik mahatvapurn kshetra par gaur karte hue use saamaajik vigyaan se sambandhit paaya: Symptoms classify signals and signaling systems according to their mode of communication
 This process of meaningfulness relies on the use of codes used by humans to form words that may be individual vowels or letters, bodily actions to denote by their organisms or emotions, or commonly worn clothing
 kisi vastu ke sandarbh ke liye shabd gadhane hetu, samudaay dwaara apni bhashaa main ek saamaanya arth ko sweekrut karnaa hoga

 kuta samskruti ke mulyon kaa bhi pratinidhitiv karte hai or jivan ke har pahalu ko arth ke nae rang jodne main sakasham hai
 To clarify the relationship between symptomatology and communication studies, communication is defined as the process of transferring data from source to recipient
 isliye, sampreshan ke vichaarak kuta, madhyam or sandarbh ke aadhaar par aaveshtit jaiviki, manovigyaan or yantriki ko spasht karne ke liye modelon kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Both subjects also believe that the technical process cannot be separated from the fact that the recipient has to decode the data, ie being able to interpret the data by identifying it as the main one
 iskaa matlab he ki lakshanikta or sampreshan ke bich anivarytah paraspar vyapan he
 In fact, many concepts are shared, although the emphasis is different in each area
 messejas and minings: en introdection tu semiotics, marcel danesi sujhata he ki lakshanshastriyon kii praathamiktaayen, mahatv kaa adhyayan pehle or sampreshan baad main rahi hai
 Extremist vision was introduced by jean-jacques Nataíz, who considered the theoretical study of communication irrelevant to the application of semiotics as a musicologist
 lakshanikta bhashaa-vigyaan se is arth main alag he ki vah sanket kii paribhaasha ko samanyikrut karata he taaki sanketon ko kisi bhi madhyam main yaa samvedi reeti main sammilit kiya ja sake
 is prakaar yah sanket pranaaliyon or sanket sambandhon kii vyapaktaa ko badhaata he or bhashaa kii paribhaasha ko uskaa sarvaadhik vistrut alankaarik yaa lakshanik arth pradaan karata he
 Pierce's definition for the term "semiotic" as a study of the essential characteristics of signs, includes the effect of distinguishing it from linguistics as a study of contingent features acquired by the world's languages in the course of human development
 sambhawatah lakshan-vigyaan or bhashaa ke darshan ke bich bhed karnaa adhik kathin he
 In a sense, it is actually more of a difference between traditions than a difference of subjects
 vibhinn lekhakon ne khud ko "bhashaa kaa darshanik" yaa "lakshanshasthri" naam diya he
 This difference does not correspond to the separation of analytical and continental philosophy
 nazadik se dekhne par, vishyon ke sambandh main kuch matbhed paaya ja saktaa he
 Philosophy of language tends to pay more attention to natural languages or languages in general, while semiotics is more concerned with non-linguistic significance
 bhashaa ke darshan kaa bhashaa-vigyaan ke saath bhi ek majboot rishta he, jabaki sanketikta katipay manviki or saanskrithik nrivigyaan ke nikat he
 Semiosis or semeiosis is a process that derives meaning from any organism's apprehension about the world through signs
 sanketon kaa mahatv or sarthakata ko darshan or manovigyaan ke samast itihaas main manyata mili he
 Both Plato and Aristotle explore the relationship between signs and the relationship of the world, and Augustine considers the nature of the sign within the traditional system
 in siddhanton kaa pashchimi darshan par sthai prabhaav padaa, visheshkar shaikshik darshan ke madhyam se
 haal hi main, ambarto iko ne apane semiotics and filosphi of language main tark diya he ki lakshanik siddhant adhikansh, sambhawatah sabhi pramukh vichaarkon ke kaaryon main nihit he
 Early thinkers in this field include Charles W
 Morris Max Black considers Bertrand Russell's work preliminary
 lakshanikta ke anuprayogon main shaamil hai: Semiotics is only slowly establishing itself as an honorable subject
 kuch deshon main, uski bhoomika keval saahitiyik aalochana or drishy or shravy madhyamon tak hi simit he, lekin yah sankeern sankendran saamaajik or raajnneetik balon ke vyapak saamaanya adhyayan tak vistrut ho saktaa he ki kaise aadhunik samskruti ke antargat sakriy sthiti ko aakaar diya ja saktaa he
 In the current era of mass communication, issues of technology determinism assume new importance in the selection of media and the design of communication strategies
 arth ke vibhinn str or kabhi-kabhi chhipe prayojanon ko prakat karne ke liye lakshanik tareekon ke upyog ne kuch ko marxvaadi, nashwadi aadi ke rup main vishay ke tatwon ko naarkeey rup dene ko uksaaya he 
 Research has been published in dedicated journals such as Sign System Studies, founded by Juri Lotman and published by Tartu University Press; Semiotica, founded by Thomas A
 Sebeok and published by Mouton de Gruyter; Zeitschrift fur Semiotic; European Journal of Semiotics; Versus and others; Accepted articles in magazines of the American Journal of Semiotics and other subjects, especially magazines oriented towards philosophy and cultural criticism
 lakshanikta ne kai up-kshetron ko utpann kiye hai, jinamein nimnlikhit shaamil hai, par ye itane tak hi simit nahin he: Pictorial semiotics is intimately associated with art history and theory
 tathaapi, yah donon se kam se kam ek moulik tareeke se aage bad gai he
 While the history of art has limited its visual analysis to the small number of paintings that qualify as "artistic creations", pictorial semiotics has generally focused on the characterization of the paintings
 kala ke is paaramparik itihaas or siddhant se-or saath hi, lakshanik vishleshan kii anya pramukh dhaaraon se hatakar-sachitr lakshanikta ke liye vistrut vividhta kii sambhaavnaaon ko mauqaa miltaa he
 Some influences have been derived from event-action analysis, cognitive psychology, structural and cognitive linguistics and visual anthropology / sociology
 lakshanik siddhant ko varnit karne ke liye aahaar ek manapsand paaramparik vishay rahaa he, kyonki vah atyant sulabh he or ausat vyakti ke jivan se aasaani se joda ja saktaa he
 Semiotics is the study of signaling processes when it operates individually or in groups and how these signaling processes provide insight into circulating and understanding meaning
 aahaar ko isliye lakshanik kaha he kyonki taiyaar ho jane par uskaa arth badal jaataa he
 The comparison of the diet eaten by a wild animal to that of a corpse to represent a cultural dish clearly changes meaning when compared to a diet prepared by humans in the kitchen
 khaadya padaarth ko kuch saamaajik sanket-paddatiyon kaa pratik bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 "if food is treated as a gesture, the message it encodes will be found in the pattern of expressive social relationships
 The different hierarchies of message hierarchy, inclusion and exclusion, boundaries and boundaries transcend -day is about "
 aahaar is baat kaa lihaaj kiye bina hi lakshanik he ki use kaise taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Whether food is prepared with full precision in a good dining restaurant, or picked up from a pile of garbage, broken, swallowed, or eaten by a wild animal can still always be interpreted on this basis How a particular diet was prepared and in what context it was served
 vartmaan anusandhan ne paaya ki, jaise-jaise shakhaaen viksit hoti hai or adhik antarrashtriya ho jaati hai, unke pratik-chihn adhik pratikatmak or kam pratishthit ho jate hai
 The prestige and symbolism of a sign depends on cultural conventions and are related to each other on that basis
 yadi saanskrithik pratha kaa sanket par atyadhik prabhaav he, to sanket adhik pratikatmak mulya hasil karte hai
