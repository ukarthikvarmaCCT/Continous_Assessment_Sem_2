 Wilson is known as an academic scholar, administrator, historian, jurist and politician who explained the functions of public administration
 woodro wilson kaa janm 28 disambar 1856 ko america ke varjeenia praant main hua tha
 He graduated from Princeton University in 1879, studying politics, administration and law
 princeton vishvavidhyalay se hi 1886 main wilson ne piech
 di
 kii oopaadhi praapt kii
 His first work was published by the Congress Government in 1884
 wilson 1886 se lekar 1902 tak raajnneeti vigyaan ke professor rahe
 During the period from 1902 to 1910, he held the post of President of Princeton University
 wilson ko 1910 main new jersey rajya kaa governor chunaa gaya
 In 1912 Wilson was elected the 28th President of the United States
 ve 8 varshon tak america ke raashtrapati ke pad rahane ke baad sevanivrutt ho gayi
 In 1919 Wilson received the Nobel Prize for Peace
 1924 main mastishk aghat se unka nidhan ho gaya
 Woodrow Wilson would not have even dreamed that he would one day become President of the United States
 bahut kam aise log hai jo is pad par raajnneetik aparipakvatapurna vyaktitv se pahunche honge
 But after becoming President no one would have acted with as much perseverance, prudence, nation-building efficiency and duty-devotion as Wilson, the Messiah of Peace
 ek bhavishyadrushtataa or adarshavaadi hote hue bhi vah linkan ke baad sabase acha adhik yathartwaadee or nipun raajnneetik netaa tha
 But no one knew in 1913 that Wilson would become a great man
 koi nahin jaanata tha ki wilson dwaara sanyukt rajya america ko pratham vishwayuddh main bhaag na lene ke sabhi prayatnon ke baavjood bhi us raashtra ko yuddh main nirnaayak bhaag lenaa hoga
 Nobody knew that he would go beyond the Atlantic to try to give permanent peace to the world, and his efforts would be destroyed at the altar of selfishness and domestic petty opposition by some European politicians
 kisi america raashtrapati ne apane hi aadarshon evam yojanaon ko apane hi logon dwaara nirdayatapurvak nirast evam parajeet hote hue nahin dekha hoga
 Wilson was a professor of political science
 atev vah chintak tha
 He wrote extensive texts on American administration
 uskaa vichaar tha ki karypalika evam vyavasthapika main shakti ke bantwaare se shashan main saamanjasy nahin ho paaya
 Therefore, he wished that the American President should be as powerful as the Prime Minister of England
 jab vah raashtrapati bana to usne nihsandeh apane vichaaron ko karyanvit kar raashtrapati kii shashan kaa shaktishaalee kendra-bindu banaaya
 There was bold boldness in it, a senseless sincerity
 uskaa vishwaas tha ki satvik kaaryon kii sadaiv vijay hogi or satya ke pratinidhiyon ko asaty, avivek evam aadambar se samjhauta nahin karnaa chaiye
 In the early years of his reign, he attracted the attention of the entire public
 usne sampoorn rashtriya jivan main samarpan, tyaag evam naitikta kii bhaavana ko prerit kiya
 But he became so proud of himself for his sattvikta and purposes that he started thinking that those who opposed him were opposing God
 usamen linkan kii vinamrata kaa abhaav tha
 In his election campaign, he gave the slogan of Progressivism, abandoning the conservative views of the past
 raashtrapati banane ke baad usne apane vyaktitv main samjhautavaadi jivan grahan nahin kiya, haalanki raashtrapati pad ke namakan ke liye usne us bryan kii bhi bahut prashansa kii thi jiske sambandh main uski dharna yah thi ki ‘use kachare main phank dena chahie
 In fact, his personality was a combination of many qualities
 vah khushaamad pasandagi kii evam vinamr ghoosekhori kii kala se parichit tha, lekin saath hi vah gahari naitikta, dayaa evam samvedansheel vritti kaa bhi tha
 He used to identify good and bad
 usamen ‘purv vimaan’, plato ke ‘darshanik raja’ evam maikiyavali ke ‘rajkumaar’ ke tattvon kaa samavesh tha
 Like Lincoln, he proved worthy of his responsibility over time
 wilson shaanti ke rajnay main vishwaas karata tha, matbhedon ko vaarta ke rajnay dwaara sulajhane kaa pakshdhar tha
 He was idealistic
 jab duusari baar vah raashtrapati chunaa gaya tab use is baat kii gambheer chintaa thi ki vishwa kii tanaavpurn sthiti ko dekhte hue america ko tatasthta ke paaydaan par nahin rakhaa ja saktaa tha
 Wilson was an advocate of peace
 vah acchhee tarah jaanata tha ki vishwa yuddh main america pradesh se amarikiyon kii vichaardhaara, darshan evam sahitya par yupriyata kaa baari prabhaav padegaa
 Wilson presented the American proposals for peace, which were rejected by the European powers
 america ne tatasthta kii ghoshnaa kii
 On 4 September 1914, in his diplomatic reference to the Congress, Wilson said- "this situation is not created by us but it is in front of us
" yah hamen pratyaksh rup se prabhavit karti he maano ham un paristhitiyon ke bhagidaar hai jinhone ise janm diya he
 We will pay for it even though we have not intentionally given birth to it
 “ america mahayuddh se achoota nahin rah saktaa tha phir bhi 1914 main koi america nahin jaanata tha ki unhen yuddh main sanlagn hona padegaa
 When Germany's u-boats started an uncontrolled war, America, the last powerful neutral country against Germany, entered the war
 wilson ne 2 april 1917 ko congress ko apana prasiddh sandesh bheja, jisamen usne apane desh ko salaah di ki yah yuddh main pravesh kare or vishwa ko loktantreey shaktiyon kii raksha kare
 In the said message, he said, "we will definitely fight for the principles we want from the heart
 ham loktantr kii raksha karenge
 We will protect the rights of those who respect a just authority and thus want some rights in their governance by remaining disciplined
 ham sabhi chote deshon or rashtron ke adhikaron or swatantrataaon kii aavashyak raksha karenge
 We would like to ensure that free people throughout the world have just and free freedom, so that peace and security can be maintained in all countries and thus the whole world will be free
 aaj america ke saubhaahgya se vah din aa gaya he jabaki hamaare naagarik apana rakt or apni shakti un siddhanton kii raksharth vyay karenge jinke aadhaar par america kaa janm hua tha, jinke aadhaar par america ko sukh or samruddhi praapt hui thi tathaa vah amuly shaanti praapt hui jise vah atyant mahatv kii drushti se dekhtaa aayaa he
 " shantipriy wilson vivash tha
 It was a matter of great importance for America's future that he had found such a person as President who transformed the basis of this war into a 'noun of salvation and reform'
 17 janvari 1917 ke bhaashan kaa ek ansh uski sampoorn maanavtaa ke prati samvedansheel vichaaron ko abhivyakt karata he-”bina kisi paksh kii vijay ke shaanti, prayek jati ke liye aatm-nirnay kaa siddhanth, samuhik, swatantrata, astr-shastron kaa parisemen, uljhane vaali sandhiyon kaa unmoolan tathaa akraman kii roak ke liye samuhik sangrakshan kii vyavastha
 "on April 2, Wilson appeared in front of the nation's highest representative congress and asked for permission to declare war
 ”is mahaan shantipurna janata ko yuddh kii ore-jo sabase adhik bhayanak or vidhvansak yuddh he
 
taking is a terrible thing
 sabhyataa swayan bhi sankat ke palade main jhul rahi he kintu nyaay shaanti kii apeksha moolyawaan he ore ham aisi vastuon ke liye ladenge jo hamen atyadhik priy rahi hai
 For democracy, for the rights of the people who believe in the rule that they should be heard in their own government, for the rights and freedom of the small nations, for the rule of the world by the organizations that bring peace to all nations and Provide security and finally the world can become independent
 aise hi lok kaary ko apana jivan or apana sarvasv samarpit kar sakate hai
 With the campaign that the day has come, America's placenta blood and power should be spent for the principles that have given her birth and peace, which she has protected, that is, if God is pleased Can't do anything else
 “ After the war, whether Wilson had suffered defeat and whether it was bitterly criticized by nominal realists, his speech was a turning point in American history and politics
 unke hriday se nikalne vaale shabd itane maarmik the ki sara raashtra uski aawaaj par taanaashaahee par prajatantra kii barbarta par sabhyataa kii vijay ke liye yuddh main kud padaa
 In the countries across the seas, he not only appeared as a unique great man, but also came to be recognized as the leader of a powerful nation, who descended to protect a peaceful, pleasant and orderly life in the world
 nevins evam comajor ke shabdon main- ” 'shakti adhikadhik shakti, shakti bina kisi rukaawat yaa seemaa ke' yah vachan rashtradhyaksh wilson ne diya tha or raashtra hathvadita ko thopane main safalataa praapt kii
 Immediately worked to fulfill this promise
 iske purv kii kisi sarkaar ne yuddh main isse adhik budhimaani ore kaaryakshmata nahin dikhalaai thi
 Even before this, the Americans did not show such vigor, resourcefulness and invented intelligence
 “ ‘bina vijay kii shanti’ yuddh kaa naaraa ban gaya tha
 After the cease-fire treaty, Wilson, who did not listen to the advice of his secretary, reached the Paris Peace Conference in December 1918, he was welcomed as the 'messiah of Peace'
 europe main us samay yah bhaavana vidyaman thi ki keval wilson hi aisa vyakti he jo vibhinn rashtron ke raag-dwesh or unki irshyaa-bhaavana se upar uthaa hua evam maanavtaa kaa rakshak he
 Therefore, when this philosopher king took the booklet of his principles in his hand, armed with military power, came to set the terms of the treaty, the people of Europe opened his heart in his honor
 sabhi deshon main uskaa abhootpurv swaagat hua
 When he reached Paris, the French were delighted to see him
 sadakon par apaar jan-samooh ne uski stuti kii or akhabaaron ne uske gungan kiye
 In fact, everyone's eyes were on him
 vijayi nyaay kii, vijit dayaa kii or saamaanya jan-shakti kii aashaa karte the
 Wilson came to this conference as a lamp of peace
 vah nahin chahta tha ki paris sammelan 1815 ke vienna congress jaise nihit swaarthon kaa garh ban jaye
 But he could not guess that the conquering nations had a vestige of selfishness and if he had taken into account other facts, he would have escaped the trap or deception in which he himself got badly entangled due to his idealism
 uske pavitra uddeshy vijeta rashtron kii satta-pipaasa ke aage bhasmasaat ho gayi
 Wilson presented his ideas as the famous 14 sutras
 uske 14 sutron main pratham sutara yahi tha ki shaanti ke samjhaute saarvajanik rup se kiye jaayengen, koi gupt samjhauta nahin hoga
 These principles were also appreciated by the politicians of the Allies
 unke paas yudhottar samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye uparokt siddhanton ke atirikt or kya tha ? or parajeet rashtron ne bhi in siddhanton ke prati apni sahmati prakat kii parantu aadarshon evam siddhanton kii antatah shakti-poojak rashtron ke saamne kuch na chal saki
 The conference was also dominated by nationalist ideas, personal interests, which were predominant in the Vienna Congress
 france kaa klemency or england kaa loyad donon ne hi wilson par apni hathvadita ko thopane main safalataa praapt kii
 RB Mobat wrote in 'european Diplomacy' that "clemenceau used to repeat this sentence in the morning - i will support the establishment of the League of Nations"
 “ kintu italy ke orlando se jab ek baar poocha gaya ki rashtrasang ke bare main aapkaa kya mat he to uttar diya tha ki ”ham nihsandeh rashtrasang kii sthapana kaa swaagat karenge kintu fum kaa prashn tay kiya janaa chaiye
 "wilson was alone in the entire conference
 vienna congress ke pashchaat europe main is prakaar itane vishaal paimaane par vishwa str kaa koi sammelan nahin hua tha
 This former professor of political philosophy at Princeton was a talented orator and idealist thinker
 vah kathor vishwaason kaa vyakti tha jisamen raajnneetik doordarshita to ucch koti kii thi, lekin itani kootnithik yogyata nahin thi ki vah anya pratinidhiyon ko parajeet rashtron ke saath udaar vyavhaar ke liye taiyaar kar sake
 In the words of Stanard Baker, "whoever saw him working, never dared to dare to blasphemy before Wilson or behind his back
" “ wilson kaa yah vishwaas tha ki rashtrasang kii sthapana se hi maanav jati kii raksha ho sakati he, atah vah ise sab shaanti-sandhiyon kaa anivaary ang bananaa chahta tha
 But he was not mentally as sharp as Lloyd George and Clemenceau and relied exclusively on his pre-determined ideas, so he proved to be a novice in the field of diplomacy and political bargaining
 uske adarshavaad or rashtrasang kii sthapana ke atyadhik utsaah kaa duusare deshon ne puraa laabh uthaaya
 For other nations to accept the creation of the League of Nations, Wilson was willing to give up everything, even for the League of Nations he agreed to disregard many of the principles of his 14 sources
 paal bardsal ke kathananusaar vah kshatipurti kii samasya ke atirikt anya sabhi prashnon par britain, france or japan se rashtrasang ke naam par praayah apni adhikansh baaten manwaane main safal hua
 The Chinese state should have been found by the Chinese people on the basis of Wilson's theory of self-determination, but Wilson decided to give it to Japan with the desire to get the support of other superpowers to establish the League of Nations
 yah nirnay swayammev wilson dwaara apane siddhanton par kutharaghaat tha
 Nevertheless, if a little leniency was dealt to the defeated at the Paris Conference, it was because of Wilson
 isamen koi sandeh nahin tha ki yadi wilson sammelan main na hota to loyad jorge or klemenso na jane kya se kya kar dete
 Wilson continued to curb his infinite aspirations
 yadi wilson na hota to france germany kaa namonishaan mitaakar hi dam letaa
 Wilson had two objectives
 pratham nyaaypurna samjhauta jiske anusaar aatm-nirnay ke siddhanth par rashtron kii simaaon kaa nirdhaaran ho taaki paraspar shaanti sthapit ho sake
 Second, the establishment of the League of Nations
 pehle uddeshy main vah safal nahin hua kyonki jo shaanti kii gai vah thopi hui shaanti thi na ki aatm-nirnay ke aadhaar par yaa samjhauta-vaarta kii shaanti
 But he succeeded in the second objective
 rashtron ke sangh kaa vichaar moulik nahin tha or kai deshon main kai logon ne is vichaar ko spasht karne main yogadan diya tha, kintu jis rashtrasang kii antim rup se sthapana kii gai thi vah wilson kii hi sristi thi or uske aadarshon kaa mandir tha
 Some scholars think that Wilson himself made a huge mistake by coming to Paris
 yadi vah washington main rah kar hi american pratinidhiyon ko aadesh detaa rahata to bahut sambhav tha ki uskaa prabhaav adhik vyapak hota, par wilson ko sarvaadhik chintaa rashtrasang kii thi or uski abhilaashaa thi ki vishwa sanstha ke vidhaan kaa nirmaan vah swayan kare
 In fact, it was very unfortunate that while his presence at the conference was not beneficial to the conference itself, he could not even keep contact with the American public while away from his country, which resulted in the United Nations being nurtured by his own country
 Only rejected
 american seenet ne wilson ke rashtrasang kii sadsyta ke prastaav ko nahin mana
 In the 1918 congressional elections, the anti-wilson Republican Party won a majority in both houses of Congress, and the Senate revoked the League's consent to accept the Treaty of Legislature and Versailles
 yah maanavtaa ke ek mahaan paigambar kaa dukhamay paraabhav tha
 Woodrow Wilson believed that public administration should separate from politics
 unhen saamaanya taur par prashasan or raajnneeti main vibhaajan ko rekhaankit karne ke kaaran yaad kiya jaataa he
 According to Wilson, the composition of a constitution is easy but it is difficult to implement it
 unhone kriyanvayan ke kshetra ke adhyayan par vishesh bal diya
 In his essay Study of Administration, Wilson, while discussing the interrelationships of politics and administration, wrote that administration is outside the domain of politics

 khushbir singh 'shaad', bharat se urdu bhashaa ke ek shaayar hai
 Seven of his ghazal books have been published simultaneously in Devanagari and Urdu
 rezang laa bharat ke jammu or kashmir rajya ke laddakh kshetra main chushul ghati ke dakshinpurv main us ghati main pravesh karne vaala ek pahari darra he
 It is 2
7 km long and 1
8 km wide and has an average elevation of 16,000 feet
 1962 ke bharat-china yuddh main rezang laa kumaun regiment ke 13 kumaun daste kaa antim morcha tha
 The squad was led by Major Shaitan Singh, who received the Param Vir Chakra posthumously for his valor
 yahan bhartiya or chini balon ke bich muthbhed main 123 sainikon ke bhartiya daste main se 109 ne apni jane di thim
 For this, a memorial has been built in Rewari village of Haryana from where many soldiers of this squad came
 is smarak par darj he kii isi ladaai main 1,700 chini sainik maare gaye the
 There is also a war memorial on Rezang La on which commemorates that encounter with an excerpt from Thomas Babington Macaulay's poem "horacio": jab jaev praudyogiki kaa upyog prakritik paryaavaran ke adhyayan ke liye yaa main kiya jaataa he, to use paryaavarniya jaev-praudyogiki kehete hai
 The use of biotechnology for commercial use and use can also be considered as environmental biotechnology
 paryaavarniya jaev-praudyogiki hetu antarrashtriya sosayadi ne paryaavarniya jaev-praudyogiki kii vyakhya is prakaar kii he, "dooshit vaataavaran ko thik karne or paryaavaran-anukool prakriyaaon ke liye jaivik tantron kaa vikaas, upyog tathaa viniman"
 Environmental biotechnology can normally be described as "under processes benefiting from the integrated cycle of renewable energy, foods and nutrients by vegetation, bacteria, fauna, fungi and algae
" Optimum use of nature for manufacturing, where the waste material of each process becomes the food of another process
 ieeestidi ke madhyam se vigyaan ne, kam paimaane vaale krishi paristhitik krishi tantron or praudyogiki main vikaas kii apil kii he taaki khaadya suraksha, jalwaayu parivartan upshman, jalwaayu parivartan anukulan evam sahasrabdi vikaas lakshyon, aadi kii prapti ho sake
 It has been observed that environmental biotechnology has played an important role in ecological agriculture as a zero-yield agricultural produce and most importantly through the implementation of 15 million biogas chemical plants
 ek aise vaataavaran par vichaar karen jisame ek vishesh prakaar kaa pradooshan adhiktam he
 Let us consider the waste material from a starch industry which has been mixed in a local pond or lake such as a water log
 ham starch ke vishalkay sangrah dekhte hai jo itani aasaani se sookshm jeevon dwaara nichle padaarthon main nahin badale jate, kuch ek apwaad chhod kar
 ham pradooshit sthal se kuch sookshm jeevon ko pruthak kar unke jinom jaise ki, dwibhajit prajnan athwa utpatti jaise kisi mahatvapurn badlaav ke liye scan karte hai
 After that the change in the jeans is known / understood
 yah isliye karte hai taaki pataa lagaaya ja sake ki pruthak kiye hue jeev ne, starch ko nichle padaarthon main parivartit karne hetu swayan ko anya sookshm jeevon kii tulana main behatar swaroop main badla athwa nahin
 In this way, the resulting genes are cloned into micro-organisms, which become industrially important and are used in economically more important processes such as the pharmaceutical industry, yeast / booms, etc
 isi tarah kii paristhitiyon kaa udhaaharan diya ja saktaa he- mahasaagaron ke jal par tel chhalak jane par safai anivaary ho jaati he, tel kuen, tel sthanantaran main upyogi pipelinon aadi kii tarah tel samrudh vaataavaran se pruthak kiye gaye sookshm jeevon main yah yogyata paayi gayi ki, ve tel ko nichle padaarth main badal athwa use urja strot ke rup main prayukt karne hetu tabdeel kar sakate hai
 In this way they can be used as a remedy when oil spills
 ab ek or udhaaharan diya ja sakegaa- sookshm jeev jinhen kitnashak se prachur mitti se alag kiya jaataa he, unamem yah kshamta hoti he ki, ve urja strot ke rup main kitnashkon ko upyog main laaye jane laayak rup main tabdeel kar sakate hai or isliye jaivik khaad main milaane par, ve krishi ke manch par kitnashak kii badhati vishaaktata ke str ko kaabo main karne vaale utkrisht upaay sabit hote hai
 But the opposite argument may be that the newly introduced microorganisms should not create an imbalance in the environment
 vah vishisht paryaavaran, jisame ham naveen khoje gaye jeev ko padaarpit karne ja rahe hai, usamen astitv rakhane vaale jeevon ke bich ke aapasi sadbhaav ke swaroop main badlaav ho saktaa he, evam ham logon kaa atyant saavdhaan rahanaa anivaary he taaki paryaavaran main aapasi sambandhon ke astitv main dakhal na ho
 An analysis of both these advantages and disadvantages will pave the way for an immediate version of environmental biotechnology
 antat, vah paryaavaran hi he jise surakshit rakhane main ham prayasarat hai

 idli kaa dakshin bhartiya khanpan main lanbaa itihaas he
 It is mentioned in the Kannada document of Sivakoti Acharya in 920, and it is revealed that this dish was made only by fermentation of ground solution of urad dal
 chavundaray-dwitiya, pracheenatam kannada vishwakosh lokopcar ke rachayita san
1025 main varnan karte hai: idli banane kii vidhi
 After soaking the black urad dal in buttermilk, grind it finely and mix the water and spices of dahi
 phir use bhaap main pakaa len
 Kannada king and Giani Someshwar III ruled in present day Karnataka
 usne bhi apane banaae vishwakosh main idli ko sthaan diya he
 This fund was created in 1130 AD under the name Manasollas
 isamen chaaval ko milaane kaa koi gyaat itihaas satrahavin shatabdi tak nahin miltaa he
 It would have been discovered later, that mixing of rice speeds up the fermentation process
 haalanki tab ke bataae kuch samagri ansh badal gaye hai, phir bhi paak vidhi vahi he
 
 daal chaaval kii idli banane ke liye, daal chaaval ko bhigo kar pis kar mishran taiyaar karnaa hoga or us mishran ko farmant bhi karnaa hoga, idli acchhee tarah se spanji tabhi banegi jab mishran acchhee tarah se farmant hua hoga, isaliye sabase pehle mishran taiyaar karnaa hoga
 If you want to make idli on Sunday, then people living in hot state must soak lentils on Saturday, but those living in cold state will have to soak lentils on Friday, because fermentation is late in the cold
 
 urad kii daal or chaaval ko saaf kijiye, dhoiye or alag alag 4 ghante yaa raat bhar ke liye pani main bhigo dijiye
 urad daal se atirikt pani nikaal dijiye or kam pani kaa prayog karte huye ek dam baarik pis lijiye, chaaval se bhi atirikt pani nikaal dijiye or kam pani kaa prayog karte huye thodaa sa motaa pisiye, dono ko milaaiye tathaa itnaa gadha ghol taiyaar kijiye ki chamache se giraane par ek dam dhar ke rup main nahi girnaa chaiye
 To ferment the mixture, add salt and baking soda as per taste, cover it and keep it in a warm place for 12-14 hours, the fermented mixture doubles as before
 idli banane ke liye mishran taiyaar he
 Stir the mixture with a spoon, if it seems too thick then add some water
 If you have a traditional idli dish, then it is very good
 
 nahin to aap idli mekar or pressure cooker main bhi idli bana sakate hai

 Froyd's exploration of mania is authentic
 froid ke drushtikon se unmaad ke rog main do baaten pramukhat: milti hai : Mania is often a re-remembering of sexual experiences
 aksar ve hi vyakti unmaad rog ke shikaar hote hai jinaki kaamashkti kaa uchit vikaas nahin ho paata
 In fact, there is a considerable similarity between the actions of the patient of mania and the actions of hypnosis and orgasm
 vikrut kambhaav hone ke kaaran jab unmaad ke rogi se kuch poocha jaataa he to vah yahi kahata he : ""main nahin jaanata, mujhe aisi kuch baaten samaran nahin hai"" - iskaa arth yah he ki vah kuch kahana nahin chahta kyonki isse uske agyaat achetan man main padi bhavangranthi ko thes pahunchati he

 jiske ghar yaa aasapaas koi unmaad kaa rogi ho to Brajbuli is the name of the poetic language which the devout poets from the eastern regions of North India, namely, Mithila, Bengal, Assam and Orissa have predominantly used to describe Krishna's pastimes
 nepal main bhi brajabuli main likhe kuch kavy tathaa naatakagranth mili hai
 This poetic language has been used for centuries
 isvi san kii 15veen shatabdi se lekar 19veen shatabdi tak is kavyabhasha main likhe pad milte hai
 Although there has been a long tradition of "brajbuli literature", the use of the term "brajbuli" is found in the 19th century AD
 is shabd kaa prayog abhi tak keval bengali kavi ishwarchandra gupt kii rachana main hi mila he
 There is a lot of disagreement among scholars regarding the etymology of the word "brajbuli" and the origin of the Brajbuli language
 yahan ek baat ko spasht kar dena aavashyak he ki brajabuli, brajabhasha nahin he
 Both of them have different characteristics of grammar, in terms of linguistics it is accepted that Brajbuli is related to Brajbhasha
 brajabuli ke padon main brajabhasha ke shabdon kaa prayog adhik dekhne ko miltaa he
 Brajbuli originated from Avhath

 But it should not be forgotten here that along with the development of Apabhramsa, the dialects of different regions were also developing and later on, literature was also composed in those dialects

 With regard to the etymology of the word "brajbuli" some have speculated that "brajavali Boli" was translated into "brajali Buli" and "brajali Buli" became "brajbuli"
 yah clisht kalpana he
 In fact, it seems more logical that Krishna's pastimes are described in this language, hence the association of Krishna's pastimes with "braj", this language would have been deemed "brajboli" which became "brajbuli" due to the uniqueness of Bengali's pronunciation

 Infesura discusses that, in 1492, when Pope Innocent VIII went into deep unconsciousness, the blood of three boys was poured into the dying Pope's body at the suggestion of a physician
 The boys were ten years old and were pledged to give one gold coin to each of them
 haalanki, na keval pope mar gaya, balki uske teen bachche bhi mar gaye
 Some writers accuse Infesura of being anti-papal and its description is not correct

 The first fully documented human transfusion was performed on June 15, 1967 by Dr
 Jean Baptiste Denis, the renowned physician of Emperor Louis XIV of France
 unhone ek bhend kaa raktaadhan ek 15 varsh ke ladke main kiya, jo raktaadhan ke baad jivit batch gaya
 Dennis also murders a laborer and he too survives

 lekin moroy kii patni ko uski maut kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 Although it was later determined that Morroy actually died of arsenic poisoning, Dennis's experiments with animal blood sparked a heated controversy in France
 Eventually, in 1670, the process was banned

 Karl Landsteiner's work made the determination of blood groups possible and thus paved the way for safely implementing blood transfusions
 For this discovery, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine in 1930

 Following the Bogdanov sample, the Soviet Union established a national system of blood banks in the 1930s
 News of the Soviet experience reached the United States, where in 1937, Bernard Fantus, director of medical medicine at the Cooke County Hospital in Chicago, founded the first hospital, the Blood Bank, in the United States
 At the time of establishing a hospital laboratory that preserved and deposited donor's blood, Fantas introduced the term "blood bank"

 Globalization involves greater interaction and interdependence between different nations of the global economy kaarobaari maahaul ke karkon or balon vyapaar par prabhaav ke liye bahut kuch he
 Common effects and effects of such changes in business and industry are explained below: nai niti ke baad bhartiya companiyon ke aantarik bazaar se pratispardhaa or bahurashtriya companiyon se pratispardhaa kaa matlab he jo sabhi daur pratispardhaa kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Companies were able to adopt the latest technology and do what a large number of resources could do to survive and face competition
 kai companiyon ne pratispardhaa kaa saamana karnaa he or bazaar main chhodana padaa nahin kar sakaa

 Hinduism recognizes the incarnation of various deities
 praayah vishnu ke das avatar maane gayi hai jinhen dashavathar kehete hai
 Similarly, many incarnations of Shiva and other deities have also been considered
 bhagwaan vishnu hindu tridevon main se ek hai
 According to the plan of creation, after the creation of the universe, they preserve it until its dissolution
 bhagwaan vishnu ke das avtaron ko sanyukt rup se 'dashavathar' kaha jaataa he
 When human is lost in the morass of injustice and unrighteousness, then Lord Vishnu incarnates to show him the right path
 shrimadbhagavadgita main shrikrishna ke dwaara kaha gaya he : That is, whenever the loss of religion and the rise of unrighteousness, then i arise in different ages for the sacrifice of gentlemen and the destruction of the wicked
 bhagwaan vishnu ke das avatar hai : The first three incarnations, namely Matsya, Kurma and Varaha incarnated in the first Mahayuga

 The above list of Dashavatara is generally accepted in the Hindu scriptures, but there are some differences among the different texts
 udhaaharan ke liye, kuch dharmik samoohon kii manyata ke anusaar krishna hi paramatma hai or dashavathar krishna ke hi das avatar hai; atah unki suchi main krishna nahin balki unke sthaan par balram hote hai
 Some consider Balarama as an avatar, not Buddha
 saamanytah balram ko adishesh kaa avatar mana jaataa he
 In other ideas about Dashavatar, some people try to rationalize the order of incarnations, linking them to the theory of evolutionary Darwin
 is vichaar ke anusaar avatar jalchar se bhoomivas kii ore badhate kram main hai; phir aadhe jaanavar se viksit maanav tak vikaas kaa kram chalate gaya he
 Thus Dashavatara is like a symbol or metaphor of gradual development

 hindu yah maanate hai ki om kii dhwani puure brahmand main gunj rahi he
 It is heard when deep into meditation
 brahm kii pariklpana veydant darshan kaa kendriya stambh he or hindu dharm kii vishwa ko anupam dein he
 What is the relation between Brahma and God, the thinking of Hindu philosophy is different
 advait veydant ke anusaar jab maanav brahm ko apane man se jaanane kii koshish karata he, tab brahm ishwar ho jaataa he, kyonki maanav maaya naam kii ek jaadui shakti ke vash main rahata he
 That is, when the shadow of Brahma falls in the mirror of Maya, then the image of Brahma is shown to us as God
 ishwar apni isi jaadui shakti "maaya" se vishwa kii sristi karata he or us par shashan karata he
 Although God is with a negative force in this situation, Maya is not able to impress him, just as a magician is not surprised by his own magic
 maaya ishwar kii daasi he, parantu ham jeevon kii swamini he
 Although God is formless, but because of Maya, he can appear to us as many gods
 iske vipareet vaishnav maton or darshanon main mana jaataa he ki ishwar or brahm main koi fark nahin he--or vishnu hi ishwar hai
 According to the Nyaya, Vaishika and Yoga philosophies, God is the supreme and supreme soul, who is enlightened and is the creator and ruler of the world
 jo bhi ho, baaki baaten sabhi hindu maanate hai : ishwar ek or keval ek he
 It is both universal and reliable
 beshak, ishwar sagun he
 He is self-centered and the cause of the world
 wo puja or upasna kaa vishay he
 He is complete, eternal, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent
 wo raag-dwesh se pare he, par apane bhakton se prem karata he or unpar krupa karata he
 Without his will, not even a single leaf can move in this world
 wo vishwa kii naitik vyavastha ko kaayam rakhata he or jeevon ko unke karmon ke anusaar sukh-dukh pradaan karata he
 According to Srimad Bhagavadgita, he comes from time to time in the form of an avatar on the earth after a moral collapse in the world
 ishwar ke anya naam hai : parameshwar, paramatma, vidhaataa, bhagwaan 
 This god is called Musalman Allah, God, Christian God and Jews Yahweh
 hindu dharm main kai devtaa hai, jinako angrezi main galat rup se "gods" kaha jaataa he
 There can be three opinions about who these deities are: ek baat or kahi ja sakati he ki zyaadaatar vaishnav or shaiva darshan pehle do vichaaron ko sammilit rup se maanate hai
 For example, Krishna is considered to be the God under whom all other gods and goddesses are present and at the same time, all the gods and goddesses are considered to be the form of Krishna
 tisare mat ko dharmagranth manyata nahin dete
 Whatever be the thinking, these deities are integral to the colorful Hindu culture
 vaidic kaal ke mukhya dev the-- indra, agni, som, varun, rudra, vishnu, prajapati, savita or deviyaan-- saraswati, usha, prithvi, ityadi 
 Later Hinduism saw new goddesses - Ganesh, Rama, Krishna, Hanuman, Kartikeya, surya-chandra and planets and goddesses like - Durga, Parvati, Lakshmi, Sheetla, Sita, Kali, etc

 It is believed that the cow has a total of 33 Koti Devi gods
