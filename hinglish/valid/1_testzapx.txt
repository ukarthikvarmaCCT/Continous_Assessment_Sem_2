 "malanishia" kaa naam unani bhashaa ke do shabdon ko jodne se aata he - "melas" yani "kaala" or "nisos" yani "dweep"
 Therefore, the name "malanisia" means "black Island", which is a gesture towards the black skin of the human beings living on these islands

 The joint between the bones of the shoulder makes the shoulder joint the major joint of the shoulder - glenohumeral joint According to human anatomy, the shoulder joint consists of the parts of the body where the humerus connects to the scapula
 kandhaa jod ke kshetra main sanrachnaao kaa samooh he
 There are two types of cartilage in the joint
 pehali prakaar kii upasthi hoti he safed upasthi jo haddiyon kii simaaon par hoti he 
 ye haddiyon ko ek duusare par phisalane or khisakane detii he
 When this type of cartilage starts to rub, the joint becomes painful and stiff
 kandhe main dusre prakaar kii upasthi hoti he lebrm, jo sandhi upasthi se saaf taur par alag hoti he
 This cartilage sphere is more fibrous and rigid than the cartilage present at the ends of the socket joint
 iske alaava yah upasthi gartika jahaan judti he uske upar bhi pai jaati he
 Shoulder should be flexible for movement in hands and arms and also strong for movements like lifting, pulling and pushing
 Between these two tasks, there can be many types of shoulder problems that do not occur in other joints like buttocks
 kandhe main teen tarah ke jod hote he- glenoheumoral, asankut tathaa jatruk sambandhi or sternolaivicular
 The glenohumeral joint is the major joint of the shoulder, usually referred to as the shoulder joint
 yah ek gola or gartika jod he jo bhujaa ko gol ghumaane or andar or bahar chalaane main upyogi he
 It is formed by the joint between the apex of the humerus and the lateral scapula
 The shoulder sphere is the rounded, medial anterior surface of the humerus and the socket is made of glenoid fossa, which is a bowl-like part of the lateral scapula
 khaat or kandhe va sharir ke bich ke apekshkrit deele sanyojanon ke khokalepan ke kaaran bhujaa main bhayankar chanchalta hoti he jiske kaaran dusre jodo kii apeksha yahan aasaani se visthaapan ho jaataa he
 The capsule is a soft tissue envelope that surrounds the glenohumeral joint and also connects the scapula, humerus, and biceps
 yah ek patali, naram shlesh jhilli se rekhaankit he
 This conduit is strengthened by the coracohumeral nerve which connects the coracoid process of the scapula to the humerus large gland
 teen anya prakaar ke snaayu bhi hote he jo pragandika kii choti granthika ko parshvik kandhe kii haddi se jodate he or jinhen samuhik taur par glenoheumoral snaayu kaha jaataa he
 One type of muscle is called semicircular humeri, which is a slant between the back side of the tuberculum minus and the mesus of the humerus
 yah pattee samput jod kii sabase mahatvapurn or majboot snaayu he
 Sternoclavicular is found at the medial ends of the Hansuli with the uppermost part of the meubrium or sternum
 hansli trikonie or gol hoti he or menubrim uttal hoti he, va ye donon haddiyaan sandhiyon main vibhajit he
 The joint has a tight joint and a complete arthropod cycle that preserves the stability of the joint
 kastoklavicular snaayu gati par pramukh bandhan he, isiilie, jod ko pramukh rup se sthirataa detaa he
 The fibrocartilaginous cycle presented at the joint widens the range of motion
 sternokalavicular visthaapan durlabh he, haalaanki pratyaksha aghaat se kshati ho sakati he
 The shoulder muscles and its joints allow it to move at a remarkable range of motion, making it the most playful joint of the human body
 kandhaa kheenchna, samipakarsh, ghurnan, dhad ke aage-peeche kii taraf uthaanaa or sagital tal se puure 360 ghumana jaise kaary kar saktaa he
 Thus the shoulder becomes extremely unstable by the terrible range of motion and becomes more oriented by displacement and injury
 nimnlikhit main kandhe kii cheshtaa ke liye prayukt vibhinn shabd he
 The muscles that are responsible for the shoulder movement are connected to the humerus, scapula and clavicle
 jo maspesziyaan kandhe ko gherti hai ve kandhe kii kapalika or bagal ko banaati hai
 The muscle cuff that rotates the limb is an anatomical term used to refer to a group of muscles and their tedons that reduce the stability of the shoulder
 yah tendon or maspeshiyaan jo pragandika ke sar ko vivar ke glenoid main pakad ke rakhata he
 The two film pouch-like structures called the tendon allow the movement of the movement between the bone, the tendon and the muscle to be relaxed
 ye ghoomane vaali peshi kaph ko echromin ke asthivat chaap se bachaate he
 To understand the normal and pathologic function of the shoulder, it is necessary to know the force of the glenohumeral joint
 yah asthibhang ke upachaar or jod ko badalane ke liye surgery kaa aadhaar banaata he, stharikaran or dizine ropan ko opetimise karne or kandhe ke eneletic or biochemical modles kii jaanch karne or sudharne ke liye

 sanskrit nitikthaon main panchatantr kaa pehla sthaan mana jaataa he
 Although the book is no longer in its original form, its composition has been set around the third century BCE, based on available translations
 is granth ke rachayita pan vishnu sharma he
 Based on the available evidence, it can be said that when the work of this book was completed, he was about 80 years old
 panchatantr ko paanch tantron main baanta gaya he: Introducing the principles of psychology, practicality and governance, these stories present all the subjects in a very interesting way and at the same time try to teach a lesson
 panchatantr kii kai kahaniyon main manushya-paatro ke alaava kai baar pashu-pakshiyon ko bhi katha kaa paatr banaaya gaya he tathaa unase kai shikshaprad baaten kahalwane kii koshish kii gai he
 Panchatantra stories are very lively
 iname lokvyavahaar ko bahut saral tareeke se samajhaayaa gaya he
 Many people consider this book to be a powerful means of developing leadership
 is pustak kii mahatta isi se pratipaadit hoti hati he ki iskaa anuwaad vishwa kii lagbhag har bhashaa main ho chukaa he
 Panchatantra holds the first place in the fables
 panchatantr hi hitopadesh kii rachana kaa aadhaar he
 Narayan Pandit himself has accepted- vibhinn uplabdh anuwaadon ke aadhaar par isaki rachana teesri shatabdi ke aas-paas nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 In which period Panchatantra was composed, it cannot be said with certainty that the original copy of Panchatantra is not available yet
 kuch vidwaanon ne panchatantra ke rachayita evam panchatantra kii bhashaa style keadhar iske rachanakaal ke vishay main apane mat prastut kiye he
 According to Mahamahopadhyay Pt Sadasiva Shastri, the creator of Panchatantra was Vishnusharma and Vishnusharma was another name for Chanakya
 atah panchatantra kii rachana chandragupta maury ke samay main hi hui he or iskaa rachana kaal 300 i
pus
 mana ja saktaa he
 But westerners and some Indian scholars do not believe this, they say that Chanakya's second name was Vishnugupta, not Vishnusharma, and from the point of view of the available Panchatantra language, it seems to be a Gupta period
 mahamahopadhyaay pan durgaaprasad sharma ne vishnusharma kaa samay ashtamashtak ke madhya bhaag main mana he kyonki panchatantra ke pratham tantra main aathvin shatabdi ke damodar gupt dwaara rachit kuttinimat kii fparyghkah swastaranamya ityadi aryaa dekhi jaati he, atah yadi vishnusharma panchatantra ke rachayita the to ve ashtum shatak main hue honge
 But the composition of Panchatantra can not be considered in the eighth century only on the basis of the said verse, because this verse can also be projected in some version
 hartel or dow kith, isaki rachana 200 i
pus
 ke baad maanane ke paksh main he
 The influence of Chanakya's Arthashastra is also visible in the Panchatantra, on its basis also it can be said that the time of Chanakya is about the fourth century BCE, so the Panchatantra must have been composed before the third century
 is prakaar panchatantra kaa rachanakaal vishyak koi bhi mat purnataya sarvasammat nahin he
 Variant - Four versions of Panchatantra are available - pratham sanskaran mulgranth kaa pahalavi anuwaad he jo ab sirian evam arabi anuwaadon ke rup main praapt hota he
 The Panchatantra appears in the multiplied 'brihatkatha' as the second edition
 ‘brihatkatha kii rachana pashachi bhashaa main hui thi kintu iskaa mularoop nasht ho gaya he or kshemendrakrut ‘brihatkatha manjari' tathaa somdev likhit ‘kathasaritsagar’ usee ke anuwaad hai
 The third edition contains a collection of Tantrayakhika and related Jain stories
 ‘tantrakhyayika’ ko sarvaadhik pracheen mana jaataa he
 Its original place is Kashmir
 prasiddh german vidvan dow hartel ne atyant shram ke saath iske pramanik sanskaran ko khoj nikaala tha
 According to him, 'tantrayakhya' or Tantrakhya is the root of Panchatantra
 yahi aadhunik yug kaa prachlit ‘panchatantra’ he
 The fourth version is the origin of the southern 'panchatantra' and is represented by Nepalese 'panchatantra' and 'hitopadesh'
 is prakaar ‘panchatantra’ ek granth na hokar ek vishaal sahitya kaa pratinidhi he
 Panchatantra also has an important place in world literature
 iskaa kai videshi bhashaaon main anuwaad ho chukaa he
 In these translations, the translation of the Pahlavi language named 'kartakadmanak' is considered to be the oldest translation
 winternitz ke anusaar german sahitya par panchatantra kaa adhik prabhaav dekha jaataa he
 Similarly, the basis of the stories of Greek Greek and Arabian Nights of Arabia etc
 is the basis of Panchatantra
 aisa mana jaataa he ki panchatantra kaa lagbhag 50 vividh bhashaaon main ab tak anuwaad ho chukaa he or iske lagbhag 200 sanskaran bhi ho chuke he
 This is a sign of its popularity
 panchatantra main paanch tantra yaa vibhaag he
 The department has been called a system because it has given the methods of ethical governance
 ye tantra hai- mitrabhed, mitrasamprapti, kakolukkium, labdhpranash evam aparikshitkaarak
 In short, the content of these systems is as follows: nitikthaon main ek mukhya katha hoti he or usko pusht karne ke liye anek gaun kathaayen hoti hai usee prakaar ‘mitrabhed’ naamak is pratham tantra main angikatha ke purv dakshin main mahilaropya ke raja amarshakti kii katha di gai he jisamen yah bataaya gaya he ki ve apane murkh putron ke liye kaaran chintit the or isliye ve vishnusharma naamak vidvan ko apane putron ko shikshit karne ke saunp dete he or vishnusharma unhen chah maas main hi kathaon ke madhyam se sushikshit karne main safal hote hai
 Thereafter, in the Angi-tale of the part called Mitrabheda, a wicked jackal describes the enmity of a bull named Sanjeevak with a lion named Pinglak whom Singh had saved from objections and even resisted his two ministers - Karkat and Damanak

 is tantra main anek prakaar kii shikshaayen di gai he jaise ki dhairya se vyakti kathin se kathin paristhiti kaa bhi saamana kar saktaa he atah praarabdh ke bighad jane par bhi dhairya kaa tyaag nahin karnaa chahie- In this system, how much happiness and joy one gets from the attainment of a friend is told through the story of Kapotaraj Chitragriva
 vipatti main mitra hi sahaayta karata he- It has been said that coming to a friend's house gives more happiness than heaven
 is prakaar is tantra kaa upadesh yah he ki upyogi mitra hi banane chahie jis prakaar kaua, kachua, hiran or chuha mitrataa ke bal par hi sukhi rahe
 In it, narrating war and treaty, the story of the cavities of owls being burned by crows is told
 isamen yah bataaya gaya he ki swarthsiddhi ke liye shatru ko bhi mitra bana lenaa chahie or baad main dhekha dekar use nasht kar dena chahie
 In this system, the crow befriends the owl and later sets the owl's fortress on fire
 isliye shatruon se saavdhan rahanaa chahie kyonki jo manushya aalasy main padakar svachhndata se badhate hue shatru or rog kii upeksha karata he- uske rokane kii cheshtaa nahin karata vah kramshah usee se maaraa jaataa he- This system has the main story of apes and crocodiles, and other interlude stories
 in kathaon main yah bataaya gaya he ki labdh arthath abhisht kii prapti hote hote kaise rah gai arthath nasht ho gai
 It teaches through the legend of apes and crocodiles that the wise man wins with his wisdom and the fool is deprived of what is in his hands
 panchatantra ke is antim tantra arthath bhaag main visheshrup se vichaar purvak suparikshit kaary karne kii niti par bal diya he kyonki acchhee tarah vichaar kiye bina evam bhaleebhanti dekhe sune bina kisi kaary ko karne vaale vyakti ko kaary main safalataa praapt nahin hoti apitu jivan main anek kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Therefore, one should not blindfold
 is tantra kii mukhya katha main bina soche samajhe andhanukaran karne vaale ek nai kii katha he jisko manibhadra naam ke seth kaa anukaran karjain-sanyasiyon ke vadh ke dosha par nyaayadhishon dwaara mrityudand diya gaya
 Therefore, one should not act unfairly like a barber without being tested
 isamen yah bhi bataaya he ki puri jaankaree ke bina bhi koi kaary nahin karnaa chahie kyonki baad main pachhataanaa padataa he jaise ki brahman patnine bina kuch dekhe khun se lathpath nevale ko yah sochakar maar diya ki is ne mere putr ko kha liya he vastutah nevale ne to saanp se bachche kii raksha karne ke liye saanp ko maaraa tha jisase uskaa mukh khun se sanaa hua tha
 That's why it was said- is prakaar panchatantra ek upadeshparak rachana he
 In this, the author has shown his practical skills, political intelligence and knowledge
 niti-kathaon ke manwetar paatr praayah do prakaar ke hote hai, sajiv praani tathaa achetan padaarth

 Jarasandha was the king of the kingdom of Mahabharata, Magadha
 vah bahut hi shaktishaalee raja tha or uskaa sapana chakravati samraat banane kaa tha
 Although he was a powerful king, he was very cruel
 ajey ho k apana sapana puraa karne ke liye usne bahut se raajaaon ko apane karagaar main bandi banaakar rakhaa tha
 He was the father-in-law and supreme friend of Yaduvanshi Naresh Kansa of Mathura
 Both his daughters Asit and Pramit were married to Kansa
 shrikrishna se kansa vadh kaa pratishodh lene ke liye usne 17 baar mathura par chadhaai kii lekin har baar use asafal hona padaa
 Jarasandha was Sri Krishna's ultimate enemy and a warrior
 jaraasandh ke pita the magadhanaresh maharaj brihadrath or unki do patraniyaan thi
 He wanted both of them to be the same
 bahut samay vyateet ho gaya or ve buudhe ho chale the, lekin unki koi santan nahin thi
 Then once he heard that the sage Chandkaushik was in his kingdom and he is sitting under a mango tree
 yah sunate hi rajan ashapurna hokar rishi se milane chal die
 Reaching the sage, he told the sage his sorrow
 raja kaa vrutant sunakar rishi ko dayaa aa gai or unhone naresh ko ek aam diya or kaha kii ise apni rani ko khilaa dena
 But since he had two wives and loved them equally, he fed them to their two queens in equal pieces of that mango
 isse dono raniyon ko aadhe-aadhe putr hue
 In fear, they threw both of them into the forest
 tabhi vahaan se jaraa naamak ek rakshasi bhi ja rahi thi
 He saw those two carcasses of meat and he took the right carcass in the right hand and the left carcass in the left hand, adding both the pieces
 judate hi us balak ne bahut jor kii garjana kii jisase bhaybheet hokar jaraa rakshasi bhaag gai or rajbhavan main donon raniyon kii chaati se dudh utar aayaa
 That's why his name was Jarasandha
 is prakaar jaraasandh kaa janm hua
 After the completion of the construction of Indraprastha city, one day Narada Muni conveyed his father's message to Maharaja Yudhishthira that he should perform Rajasuya Yajna
 is vishay par maharaj ne shrikrishna se baat kii to unhone bhi yudhisthir ko rajasuya yajna karne ke liye protsaahit kiya, lekin maharaj yudhisthir ke chakravarti samraat banane ke maarg main keval ek roda tha, magadh naresh jaraasandh, jise parrast kiye bina vah samraat nahin ban sakate the or naa hi use ranbhumi me parrast kiya ja saktaa tha
 To solve this problem, along with Shri Krishna, Bhima and Arjuna, they disguised themselves as Brahmins and headed towards Magadha
 vahaan pahunch kar jaraasandh ne unhen brahman samajhakar kuch maang lene ke liye kaha lakin us samay brahman bheshadhari shrikrishna ne kaha kii abhi unke dono mitron kaa maun vrath he jo ardh raatri main samaapt hoga
 Then Jarasandha promised to come only at midnight and put him in the Brahmin room
 tab ardharatri main vah aayaa lekin use un teenon par kuch andeh hua kii ve brahman nahin he kayoki ve sharir se kshatriya jaise lag rahe the usne apane andeh ko prakat kiya or unhe unke vaastavik rup main aane ko kaha evm unhe pahchaan liya
 Then he got angry after hearing the goodness of Shri Krishna and asked him to take whatever he wanted and go away from here
 tab unhone brahman bhesh main hi jaraasandh ko mallayuddh karne ke liye kaha or phir apana vaastavik parichay diya
 Jarasamgh was a brave warrior, so he chose Bhima for the Malla war
 tab agle usne bhim ke saath mallbhumi main mall yuddh kiya
 This war lasted for about 28 days but he would rejoin each time Bhimsen broke it in two
 is par shrikrishna ne ghaas kii ek tandi kii sahaayta se bhim ko sanket kiya kii is baar vah uske tukade kar ke donon tukade alag-alag disha main phenke
 Then Bhima did the same and thus Jarasandha was killed
 tab uskaa vadh karke un teenon ne uske bandigrih main band sabhi 86 raajaaon ko mukt kiya or shrikrishna ne jaraasandh ke putr sahadev ko raja banaaya
 Sahadeva later supported Pandavas in the Mahabharata war
 vande maataram This song, composed in the Sanskrit Bangla mixed language by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, was published in 1882 as an underlying song in his novel Anand Math
 is upanyaas main yah geet bhavanand naam ke sanyasi dwaara gaaya gaya he
 Its tune was composed by Yadunath Bhattacharya
 san 2003 main, bibisi world sarvice dwaara yojit ek antararashtriya surveykshan main, jisamen us samay tak ke sabase mashhoor das geeton kaa chayan karne ke liye duniya bhar se lagbhag 7,000 geeton ko chunaa gaya tha or bi0bi0si0 ke anusaar 155 deshon / dweep ke logon ne isamen matdaan kiya tha usamen vande maataram sheersh ke 10 geeton main duusare sthaan par tha
 If Bengali language is kept in mind, its title should be "bande Mataram" and not "vande Mataram"
 chunki hindi va sanskrit bhashaa main 'vande' shabd hi sahi he, lekin yah geet mularoop main bangla lipi main likhaa gaya tha or chunki bangla lipi main va akshar he hi nahin at: bande maataram sheershak se hi bankim chandra chattopadhyaay ne ise likhaa tha

 Despite the decisive participation of this song in the freedom struggle, when it came to the selection of the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, a song written and sung by Rabindranath Thakur, was given preference over Vande Mataram

 The Seven Bridges of Königsberg is a historically famous puzzle of mathematics
 san 1736 main leonard oiller ne dikhaaya ki iskaa koi hal nahin he or saath-si-saath sansthiti or graph siddhanth ke kshetron kii niv rakhi
 In the state of Prussia there was a town named Königsberg on both sides of the Pregel River
 nadi ke bich main do dweep the jo ek-duusare se or mukhyabhumi se saat pulon ke dwaara jude hue the
 The riddle was: can a path be found in which one and only one of each bridge passes? Bridges in Paheli were the only way to cross the river and it was forbidden to return halfway to any bridge
 na hi kisi pul par do baar jane kii anumati thi
 Oiler showed that there is no solution to this puzzle, that is, there is no route that takes one and only one on each bridge
 oiller ne sabase pehle to yah kaha ki is paheli main keval pulon kaa hi mahatv he
 Apart from them, the other routes in the city, it does not matter
 is se vah shahar ke uljhe hue naqshe kii bajaay ek saral lakiron vaala graph prayog kar paaya
 This graph clarified the essence of the puzzle
 → → Its ridges were bridges and other points in its city point
 ab prashan sidhaa tha: kya kisi bhi ek bindu se shuru hokar koi aisa maarg liya ja saktaa he jo har lakeer par keval ek hi baar guzarataa ho? oiller ne dekha ki kisi bhi maarg ke shuru or ant ke binduon ko chhodkar, har bich ke bindu main ek lakeer se pravesh or duusari lakeer se nikaas karnaa hoga
 That is, if every bridge is allowed to go only once, then at any point there should be bridges of number of multiples of zero, two or two
 parantu dekha ja saktaa he ki paheli ke har bindu par visham sankhya ke pul hai 
 This directly means that the path this puzzle is seeking cannot be made
 oiller kii is paheli ko samajhane kii vidhi bahut prabhaavshaalee rahi
 It became clear that there is a class of mathematics and geometry questions in which it is not necessary to understand the shapes without making any changes

 In vitro fertilization) is the process in which egg cells are fertilized by sperms outside the uterus, ie in vitro
 jab sahaayta-praapt prajnan takanic kii anya paddatiyaan asafal ho jaati hai, to ivief bandhyataa kaa ek pramukh upachaar hota he
 In this process, the ovarian process is controlled by hormones and the ovaries are extracted from the woman's ovaries and fertilized by sperm in a liquid medium
 iske baad safal garbhaadhan ko sthapit karne ke uddeshy se is nishechit andanu ko rogi ke garbhashay main sthanantarit kar diya jaataa he
 The first successful "test tube baby", Louis Browne, was born in 1978
 usase pehle australian foxton skool ke shodhakartaaon ne 1973 main ek asthaayee jaev-rasinic garbhaadhan kii or 1976 main stepto or edwards ne ek bahigarbhaashayik garbhaadhan kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The Latin origin word in vitro, meaning within the glass, was used because the early biological experiments that took place to promote the tissues of living beings outside the body of the animal were all used in glassware
 , Eg, were made in beakers, test tubes, or petri dishes
 aaj kritrim pariveshi shabd kaa upyog aisi kisi bhi jeevvaigyanik prakriya ke liye kiya jaataa he jo us jeev se baahar kii jaati he jiske bheetar vah saamanytah ghatati he
 This is different from the in vivo process, in which tissue resides within the organism in which it is commonly found

 However, artificial ambient fertilization is usually performed in shallow containers called petri dishes
 haalanki autologus endometrial koculture naamak ivief paddati asal main carbonic padaarthon par sampann kii jaati he, lekin use bhi kritrim pariveshi kaha jaataa he
 This is done when the parents are facing infertility problems or they want more than one infant
 It is considered the most effective technique of artificial insemination in women
 aamtaur par iskaa prayog tab karte hai jab mahila kii andwahi naliyaan band hone hai yaa jab mard bahut kam shukranu paidaa kar paata he
 In this process, many times, eggs donated by others, donated semen or already frozen mbarayas are also used
 daan main die gaye andon kaa prayog un striyon ke liye kiya jaataa he he jo ki anda utpann nahin kar paatin
 Similarly, the eggs or semen donated in charity are also sometimes used for women who have a congenital disease in which the child is also afraid of getting it

 The success rate of technology varies and also depends on many other things
 takanic kii safalataa dar ko prabhavit karne vaali chizon main shaamil he - The process was first used in the world by Patrick Stapo and Robert Edwards in the United Kingdom
 unke is prakriya se janme bachche kaa naam louis brown tha jiskaa janm 25 july, 1978 ko manchester main hua tha
 This process was used by Dr
 Subhash Mukhopadhyay for the first time in India

 Currently IVF has a number of technologies in operation including ICSI, ZIFT, GIFT and PGD
 isiesai kaa prayog us sthiti main kiya jaataa he jab andon kii sankhya kam hoti he yaa phir shukranu, andanu se kriya karne laayak behatar avasthaa main nahin hote
 In this, the sperms are injected directly into the ovaries by the micromanipulation technique
 jedft main mahila ke andanuon ko nikaal kar unhen nishechit kar mahila ke garbhashay main sthapit karne ke bajaae uske fallopin tachub main sthapit kiya jaataa he
 The process of IVF is completed in the form of superovulation, egg retrieval, fertilization, and embryo transfer
 iskaa prayog ve mahilaayein bhi kar sakati hai jinamein rajonivritti ho chuki he or fallopian tub band ho cheke hai
 Thus, this facility proves to be a boon
 jed ai epa tii bhi ai ve epa ke sadrush hota he
 The quotation is done in the laboratory
 tab ati sadhy bhrun ko garbhashay kii apeksha fallopian tub main daal diya jaataa he
 Under GIFT, eggs and semen are transferred to the oviduct tube of the woman
 urvaran mahila ke sharir main hi hota he
 In ICSI, only one sperm is injected into the fertilized egg
 tab bhrun ko garbhashay yaa andwahi tub main transfer kiya jaataa he
 It is used for couples who have severe semen disease
 kabhi kabhi iskaa upyog aayu main bade dampatiyon ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he yaa jinka ai ve epa kaa prayaas asafal rahaa ho
 IVF can be used to treat infertility in women due to problems with the fallopian tubes, as fertilization is difficult within the body in such situations
 yah vidhi purush bandhyataa main bhi sahaayak ho sakati he, jahaan shukranuon kii gunvattta main kharabi ho
 or aise maamalon main intracitoplasmik sperm injection kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he, jahaan ek shukranu koshika ko sidhe dimb koshika main inject kiya jaataa he
 This method is used when sperm have problems entering the ovum, and in these situations the sperm of the partner or donor can also be used
 isiesai kaa upyog tab bhi kiya jaataa he jab shukranuon kii sankhya bahut kam ho
 isiesai kii safalataa kii dar ivief nishechan kii safalataa kii dar ke baraabar hoti he
 It is easy to say that the success of IVF simply requires a healthy egg, fertilized sperm and a uterus to conceive
 lekin is prakriya kii ucch laagat ke kaaran aam taur par ivief kaa prayaas anya saare saste vikalpon ke vifal hone ke baad hi kiya jaataa he
 It can also be done for egg donation or substitute motherhood where the woman providing the egg is not the woman who will complete the pregnancy period
 This means that IVF can be used for women who have undergone menopause
 daan kii gai dimbanujanakoshika ek crucible main nishechit kii ja sakati he
 If fertilization is successful, the zygote or fertilization is transferred to the uterus, within which it develops into an embryo
 anuvaanshik vikaron kii gaiyr-maujuudagi kii pushti karne ke liye preimplantesan genetic diagnosis ke saath bhi ivief kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 a similar but more general test has been developed called preimplantation genetic haplotyping
 upachaar chakra aam taur par masik dharm ke tisare din aarambh kiye jate hai or inamen dembugranthiyon ke ekaadhik putakon ke vikaas kaa uddipan karne ke liye prajnanshkti kii aushadhiyon kii niyamit khuraaq shaamil hoti he
 Injectable gonadotropins are used in most patients under intensive monitoring
 aisi monitering main samay samay par estradeol staron ko dekha jaataa he or gayanacologic ultrasonographi ke zarie putakon kii badhat dekhi jaati he
 Injections will usually be required for about 10 days
 During this cycle, natural ovulation is usually prevented with the use of gnrh agonists that begin before or during stimulation, or with the use of gnrh antagonists that are used only during the last days of stimulation; Both factors block the natural overgrowth of luteinizing hormones, and the physician can initiate the process of ovulation with the help of drugs, usually injectable human coronary gonadotropins
 jab yah tay kiya jaataa he putakeey paripakvata upyukt he, to human korionic gonedotropins diya jaataa he
 This factor, acting as an analogue of luteinizing hormone, caused ovulation to occur 42 hours after injection, but a recovery process commenced just before that to receive the ovarian cells from the ovary
 ek transvazinal takanic kii sahaayta se rogi se dimb punah praapt kiye jate hai jisamen ek ultrasound chalit sui yoni kii diwaar ko bhed kar dimb grathiyon tak pahunchati he
 The needle can be suctioned by this needle and this follicular fluid is sent to the IVF laboratory to identify the eggs
 aam taur par das se tees dimb nikaale jate hai
 This recovery process takes about 20 minutes and is usually done under conscious mitigation or general anesthesia
 prayogshaala main, pahachaane gaye dimbon se unke ird gird kii koshikaayen nikaal kar dimbon ko nishechan ke liye taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 To select eggs with optimum opportunities for successful conception, oocyte selection can be done before fertilization
 is bich, veery ko nishechan hetu taiyaar karne ke liye usamen se niskriy koshikaon or veery drav ko nikaal diya jaataa he
 This process is called sperm secretion
 yadi veery kisi shukranu daandaata dwaara uplabdh karaayaa gaya he, to aam taur par use upachaar ke liye taiyaar karne ke baad jamaaya or roganurahit kiya jayega or upyog ke liye taiyaar karne hetu use pighalaaya jayega
 The sperm and the egg are incubated in a culture medium at a ratio of 75,000: 1 for about 18 hours
 adhikansh sthitiyon main, is samay tak andanu nishechit ho jaataa he or nishechit andanu do proneuclius dikhaata he
 a sperm can be injected directly into the egg using some conditions, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection) in low sperm count or motility
 nishechit andanu ko vishesh vikaas madhyam main rakh kar lagbhag 48 ghanton ke liye chhod diya jaataa he jab tak ki andanu main chah se aath koshikaayen na ho jaaen
 In the Gammit introphallopian transfer method, the eggs are removed from the woman's body and placed in one of the fallopian tubes of the woman along with the male's sperm
 isse stri ke sharir ke bheetar nishechan kii prakriya sampann hoti he
 Therefore, this diversity is actually in vivo fertilization, not artificial inertial fertilization
 aam taur par bhrun ko punah prapti ke baad 6-8 koshika kii avasthaa main pahunchane tak sanvardhit kiya jaataa he
 Although in many Canadian, American and Australian programs, embryos are housed in a long culture system and transfer is performed about five days after retrieval at the blastocyst stage, especially if there are still many high quality embryos available on the third day
 It has been observed that blastocyst phase transfers result in higher conception rates
 europe main 2 dinon ke baad sthanantaran aam baat he
 Embryos can be cultured in artificial culture medium or in autologous endometrial coculture
 kritrim sanvardhan madhyam main, yaa to sari avadhi main ek hi sanvardhan madhyam ho saktaa he, yaa ek kramik pranali kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he, jisamen bhrun ko alag-alag madhyamon main kramik rup se rakhaa jaataa he
 For example, while culturing in the blastocyst stage, culturing can be done in one medium for up to 3 days and then another medium can be used
 madhyam blastocyst charan main maanav bhrun ke liye ekal yaa kramik donon samaan rup se prabhavi hote hai
 The artificial embryo culture medium basically contains glucose, pyruvate, and energetic ingredients, but the addition of amino acids, nucleotides, vitamins, and cholesterol makes the fetal development process even better
 dimbanujanakoshika or bhrun kii gunvattta parakhane ke liye prayogshaalaon ne grading kii vidhiyaan viksit kii hai
 To optimize conception rates, there is strong evidence that the morphological scoring system is the best solution for embryo selection
 haalanki yadi marfological rup se samaan gunvattta vaale bhrunon ke bich chayan karnaa ho, to ghulansheel echele-ji kii maujuudagi ko doosraa parameter mana ja saktaa he
 Also, two-pronuclear zygotes passing through 1PN or 3PN states) generally develop in embryos of lower quality than zygotes living 2PN continuously
 garbhaadhan kii sambhaavnaaon ko anukulit karne vaale pareekshanon ke alaava, anuvaanshik rup se milane vaale rogon se bachane ke liye preimplantesan genetic diagnosis ) yaa screening kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Embryos are classified by embryologists based on the number of cells, the symmetry of growth, and the magnitude of fragmentation
 hastantarit kii jane vaali sankhya uplabdh sankhya, stri kii aayu or anya swasthya sambandhi or naidanik karkon par nirbhar hoti he
 In countries such as Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, a maximum of two embryos are usually transferred, except in exceptional circumstances
 euke main or ) niyamon ke anusaar, 40 varsh se adhik aayu kii mahila ke sharir main adhiktam teen bhrun hastantarit kiye ja sakate hai, jabaki uese main vyaktigat prajnankshmata nidaan ke aadhaar par yuva mahilaon main kai bhrun hastantarit kiye ja sakate hai
 The effort of most clinics and national regulatory bodies is to minimize the risk of conceiving with more than one infant
 Embryos chosen as the "best" are transferred to the patient's uterus by a thin, plastic tube leading to the patient's vagina and cervix
 aropan or garbhaadhan kii sambhaavnaaon ko behatar karne ke liye garbhashay main kai bhrun pravisht karaae ja sakate hai
 The success rate of conception is called conception rate
 ivief kii sthiti main yah sabhi prayaason kaa vah pratishat hota he jiske falswaroop garbhaadhan hota he, jiskaa arth aam taur par upachaar chakron se hota he jinamein dimb punah praapt karke unhen kritrim pariveshi nishechan kiya jaataa he
 "pregnancy" data may be indicative of a positive pregnancy test and not necessarily a "viable conception", which indicates the fetal beats
 jin garbhaadhanon ke falswaroop jivit shishu janm hota he, unhen jivit janm dar kehete hai
 Nowadays in most cases a distinction is made between single and twin or more than one conception, because more than one, especially more than twin, pregnancies should be avoided as they carry many risks for the mother and the fetus
 unnat takanic kii madad se kuch varsh pehle kii tulana main aaj garbhaadhan kii daren kaafii behatar ho gai hai
 In 2006, the average rate of conception in Canadian clinics was found to be 35%
 frans main ek shodh main yah anumaan lagaaya gaya ki ivief upachaar aarambh karne vaale rogiyon main 66% rogiyon ko antat shishu prapti hui upachaar ke dauraan or 26% ko ivief upachaar band karne ke baad)
 ivief upachaar band karne ke baad shishu janm mukhyatah dattak lene ke kaaran yaa sahaj garbhaadhan ke kaaran hua
 The live birth rate is the percentage of all IVF cycles that result in infant birth and this rate is equal to the conception rate adjusted for miscarriage and stillbirth
 yah pratishat safal garbhaadhanon ke liye hai, janme shishuon kii sankhya chaahe jo bhi ho, kyonki ivief chakron main adhikansh judawaan or usase adhik shishuon kaa janm dekha gaya he
 In 2006 Canadian clinics found a rapid birth rate of 27%
 yuva rogiyon main janm daren thodi adhik thim, jinamein 21 yaa usase kam aayu ke liye safalataa kii dar 35
3% thi, jo ki moolyankit samoohon main sabase yuva samooh tha
 Older patients also had lower success rates and were declining with age, with a 37
4% rate of patients at age 27
4%, and the highest age group among the rated groups, with no live births in the age group over 48 
 kuch clinicon main ye daren adhik thim, lekin yah tay karnaa asambhav he ki aisa ucchtar takanic yaa rogi ke chayan ke kaaran hua tha, kyonki sabase mushkil rogiyon ko manaa karke yaa unhen dimbanujanakoshika daata chakra main shaamil karke safalataa kii daron ko kritrim rup se badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology) has not included the donor eggs of the fresh embryo cycle
 The 2008 success rate for US clinics summarized the prospective mother's age-to-live birth rate with a peak at 41
3% per given cycle
 And 47
3% fetal transfer for patients under 35 years of age
