 jodhabai shehzade Salim ke janm ke pashchaat mariyam-uz-jamaani kahalaayi
 He died in 1623
 uske putr jahangir dwaara uske sammaan main lahore main ek masjid banavaayi gai thi
 Bharamal was elevated to the court of Akbar and after that his sons Bhagwant Das and grandson Mansingh also remained elevated feudatories of the court
 hindu rajkumariyon ko muslim raajaaon se vivaah main sambandh banane ke prakaran akbar ke samay se purv kaaphi hue the, kintu adhikansh vivaahon ke baad donon pariwaron ke aapasi sambandh achche nahin rahe or na hi rajkumariyaan kabhi waapas laut kar ghar aayin
 Akbar, however, distinguished the case from previous episodes, where brothers or fathers of those queens enjoyed the same respect as daughters or sisters after Akbar's Muslim in-laws, except for eating and praying with them
 un rajputon ko akbar ke darbar main achche sthaan mili the
 All were adopted by him except a few conservative families who saw it as an insult
 anya rajpur rajavaadon ne bhi akbar ke sang vaivaahik sambandh banaaye the, kintu vivaah sambandh banane kii koi shart nahin thi
 The two major Rajput dynasties, the Shishodia of Mewar and the Hodha dynasty of Ranthambhore, always shied away from these relations
 akbar ke ek prasiddh darbari raja maansingh ne akbar kii ore se ek hadha raja surjan hadha ke paas ek sambandh prastaav bhi lekar gayi, jise surjan singh ne is shart par sweekaarya kiya ki ve apni kisi putree kaa vivaah akbar ke sang nahin karenge
 Ultimately, no marital relations took place, but Surjan was honored by handing over the bastion of garh-katang
 anya kai rajput saamanton ko bhi apane raajaaon kaa putriyon ko mughalon ko vivaah ke naam par dena acha nahin lagata tha
 Rathore Kalyanadas of Garh Siwan also threatened to kill Mota Raja Rao Uday Singh and Jahangir, as Uday Singh decided to marry his daughter Jodha Bai to Akbar's son Jahangir
 akbar ne ye gyaan hone par shahi phujon ko kalyandas par akraman hetu bhej diya
 Kalyanadasa worked in the war with that army and his women committed jauhar
 in sambandhon kaa raajnneetik prabhaav mahatvapurn tha
 Although some Rajput women accepted Islam on Akbar's entry into the harem, they had full religious freedom, as well as their relatives who were Hindus; High-places were also found in the court
 inke dwaara jansadharan kii dhwani akbar ke darbar tak pahunchaa karti thi
 Due to increasing interaction between the Hindu and Muslim courtiers of the court, exchange of ideas and possible progress in both religions
 isse agali peedi main donon rakton kaa sangam tha jisane donon sampradaayon ke bich sauhaard ko bhi badhaava diya
 As a result, the Rajputs became the most powerful assistants of the Mughals, the Rajput generals stayed in the Mughal army and won many wars
 inamen gujarat kaa 1572 kaa abhiyaan bhi tha
 Akbar's policy of religious tolerance opened up jobs and employment opportunities for all in the royal administration
 iske kaaran prashasan or bhi drudh hota chalaa gaya
 In the erstwhile society, prostitution was patronized by the emperor
 uski ek bahut badi haram thi jisame bahut si striyaan thim
 Most of the women were abducted and kept there
 us samay main sati pratha bhi joro par thi
 Then it is said that some of the people of Akbar, who saw the beautiful woman being Sati, would forcefully stop being Sati and tell the Emperor's orders and put the woman in the harem
 haalanki is prakaran ko darbari itihaaskaaron ne kuch is dhang se kaha he ki is prakaar badshaah salaamat ne sati pratha kaa virodh kiya va un ablaa striyon ko sangrakshan diya
 In his biography, Akbar himself has written - If i had got this intelligence already, i would not kidnap any women of my sultanate in my harem
 is baat se yah to spasht hi ho jaataa he ki vah sundariyon kaa apharan karwaata tha
 Apart from this, the futility of the matter of not kidnapping is also known from the fact that the harem was closed neither in Akbar's time nor in his time
 aaine akabari ke anusaar abdul kaadir badayunni kehete hai ki begmein, kuleen, darbario kii patniyaan athwa anya striyaan jab kabhi badshaah kii seva main pesh hone kii ichha karti hai to unhen pehle apane ichha kii soochna dekar uttar kii pratiksha kerani padati he; jinhen yadi yogya samajha jaataa he to haram main pravesh kii anumati di jaati he
 Akbar used to force his subjects to collectively organize naked performances of the women of his house, which Akbar named Khudroz
 is utsav ke peeche akbar kaa ekmaatr udeshy sundariyon ko apane haram ke liye chunanaa tha
 
 gondvanaa kii rani durgavati par bhi akbar kii kudrushti thi
 He invaded his kingdom to obtain the queen
 yuddh ke dauraan virangana ne anubhav kiya ki use maarane kii nahin varan bandi banane kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he, to usne vahiin aatmahatya kar lee
 Akbar then forced his sister and son-in-law into his harem
 akbar ne yah pratha bhi chalaai thi ki uske parajeet shatru apane parivaar evam paricharika varg main se chuni hui mahilayen uske haram main bheje
 At the time of Akbar's accession in 1556, the Portuguese had built a number of fortifications and constructions on the west coast of the continent and largely controlled shipping and maritime trade in that region
 is upniveshwaad ke chalate anya sabhi vyapaaree sansthaaon ko portugaliyon kii sharton ke adheen hi rahanaa padhata tha, jis par us samay ke shaskaon va vyapaariyon ko aapatti hone lageen thim
 The Mughal Empire made Gujarat the first target after Akbar's coronation and won the first victory on the sea coast in 1572, but keeping in view the power of the Portuguese, for the first few years he only took a pass called Kartaz to travel in the Persian Gulf region
 Kept going 1572 main surat ke adhigrahan ke samay mughalon or portugaliyon kii pratham bhent hui or portugaliyon ko mughalon kii asli shakti kaa anumaan hua or faltah unhone yuddh ke bajaay niti se kaam lenaa uchit samajha va portugali rajyapal ne akbar ke nirdesh par use ek rajdoot ke dwaara sandhi prastaav bheja
 Akbar accepted the proposal of his harem and other Muslim people from that area with a view to securing Hajj's visit to Mecca
 1573 main akbar ne apane gujarat ke prashasnic adhikariyon ko ek farmaan jari kiya, jisamen nikatavartti daman main portugaliyon ko shanti se rahane diye jane kaa aadesh diya tha
 In return, the Portuguese issued passes for the family of Akbar to go to Haj
 1576 main main akbar ne yahya saleh ke netritv main apane haram ke anek sadasyon sahit hajiyon kaa ek bada jattha haj ko bheja
 The batch arrived in two ships from Surat at Jeddah port in 1577 and proceeded to Mecca and Medina
 1577 se 1580 ke bich chaar or kaaravaan haj ko ravaanaa hua, jinke saath makka va madina ke logon ke liye bhenten va garibon ke liye sadake the
 These travelers belonged to the economically lower class of society and their departure increased the economic burden on those cities
 tab turk prashasan ne inase ghar laut jane kaa nivedan kiya, jis par haram kii striyaan taiyaar na huin
 After much controversy, he was forced to read his return
 adan ke rajyapal ko 1580 main aaye yatriyon kii badi sankhya dekhakar badha rosh hua or usne lautate hue mughalon kaa yathasambhav apmaan bhi kiya
 Due to these cases, Akbar had to stop the visits of the Hajis
 1584 ke baad akbar ne yaman ke samrajya ke adhinsth adan ke bandargah par portugaliyon kii madad se chadhaai karne kii yojana banaayi
 a Mughal envoy was permanently stationed in Goa from October 1584 to form a plan in this regard from the Portuguese
 1587 main ek portugali tukdi ne yaman par akraman bhi kiya kintu turk nausena dwaara haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 After this, the mughal-portuguese alliance also got a shock as the Portuguese were being continuously pressurized in Janjira by the Mughal Jagirdars
 akbar ek musalmaan tha, par duusare dharm evam sampradaayon ke liye bhi uske man main aadar tha
 As the age of Akbar changed, so did his interest in religion
 use visheshkar hindu dharm ke prati apane lagaav ke liye janaa jaataa hai
 He married many Hindu princesses, unlike his ancestors
 iske alaava akbar ne apane rajya main hinduo ko vibhinn rajasi padon par bhi asin kiya jo ki kisi bhi bhootpurv muslim shaasha ne nahi kiya tha
 He had come to know that in order to rule India for a long time, he should give proper and equal place to the original inhabitants here
 hinduon par lage jazia 1562 main akbar ne hataa diya, kintu 1575 main muslim netaaon ke virodh ke kaaran waapas lagaana padaa, haalanki usne baad main nitipurvak waapas hataa liya
 Jiziya tax was imposed on poor Hindus to take refuge in Islam after being forced out of poverty
 yah muslim logon par nahin lagaaya jaataa tha
 Due to this tax, many poor Hindu population was burdened, due to which they used to convert to Islam
 firoz shah tughlaq ne bataaya he, ki kaise jazia dwaara islam kaa prasar hua tha
 Akbar's occasional decision to lift the tax on Jaziya and Hindu pilgrimage had little effect on the Hindus, as it did not benefit them much, as they were withdrawn after some interval
 akbar ne bahut se hinduon ko unki ichha ke viruddh bhi islam grahan karavaaya tha iske alaava usne bahut se hindu tirth sthanon ke naam bhi islamic kiye, jaise 1583 main prayag ko elahabaad kiya gaya
 It was during the reign of Akbar that one of his warriors, Hussain Khan Tukriya, forced the Hindus to force discriminatory spectators on their shoulders and arms
 jwalamukhi mandir ke sambandh main ek katha kaaphi prachlit he
 It would be between 1542 and 1605 only when Akbar was the king of Delhi
 dhyanubhakt mata jotavaali kaa param bhakt tha
 Once he went out to Jwalaji along with his villagers to see the goddess
 jab uskaa kafila dilli se gujara to mughal badshaah akbar ke sipaahiyon ne use roak liya or raja akbar ke darbar main pesh kiya
 When Akbar asked Dhyanu where he was going with his villagers, Dhyanu replied that he was going to visit Jotwali
 akbar ne kaha teri maa main kya shakti he ? or vah kya-kya kar sakati he ? tab dhyanu ne kaha vah to puure sansar kii raksha karne vaali hai
 There is nothing that she cannot do
 akbar ne dhyanu ke ghode kaa sar katwa diya or kaha ki agar teri maa main shakti he to ghode ke sar ko jodakar use jivit kar den
 Hearing this word, Dhyanu started praising Goddess and cut off her head and offered it to Mata as a gift
 mata kii shakti se ghode kaa sar jud gaya
 Thus Akbar realized the power of the goddess
 badshaah akbar ne devi ke mandir main sone kaa chhatra bhi chadhaaya
 But he was proud in his mind that he brought the umbrella of gold, then the mother dropped the umbrella from his hand and made it of a strange metal which is a mystery till date
 yah chhatra aaj bhi mandir main maujuud he
 Historian Dasharatha Sharma says that we call Akbar great according to the history and narratives of his court such as Akbarnama, etc
 yadi koi anya ullekhneey kaaryon kii ore dekhe, jaise dalpat vilaas, tab spasht ho jayega ki akbar apane hindu saamanton se kitna abhadra vyavhaar kiya karata tha
 Hindus boycotted the temple because of Akbar's Navratna king Mansingh's construction of Vishwanath Temple after Akbar's permission
 kaaran saaf tha, ki raja maansingh ke parivaar ke akbar se vaivaahik sambandh the
 The Hindu feudatories of Akbar could not get the temple built without his permission
 bengal main raja maansingh ne ek mandir kaa nirmaan bina anumati ke aarambh kiya, to akbar ne pataa chalane par use rukvaa diya or 1595 main use masjid main badalane ke aadesh die
 The extent of outrage for Akbar is revealed by an incident
 hindu kisaanon ke ek netaa raja ram ne akbar ke makbare, sikandra, agra ko luutane kaa prayaas kiya, jise sthaneey faujadaar, mir abul fazal ne asafal kar diya
 Shortly thereafter, Raja Ram reappeared at Sikandra in 1688 and taking advantage of the delay in the arrival of Shaista Khan, he made a dent in the tomb and looted many valuable things, such as gold, silver, precious carpets, lamps, etc
 And those who could not take them were ruined
 raja ram or uske aadamiyon ne akbar kii asthiyon ko khod kar nikaal liya evam jala kar bhasma kar diya, jo ki muslimon ke liye ghor apmaan kaa vishay tha
 In later years, Akbar was also attracted towards other religions
 akbar kaa hindu dharm ke prati lagaav keval mogul samrajya ko thos banane ke hi liye nahi tha varan uski hindu dharm main vyaktigat ruchi thi
 Apart from Hinduism, Akbar was also interested in Shia Islam and Christianity
 isai dharm ke moolbhoot siddhant jaanane ke liye usne ek baar ek portugali isai dharm prachaarak ko goa se bula bheja tha
 Akbar had built a special place in the court called ibadat-khana, where he used to have religious discussions with various religious leaders and preachers
 uskaa yah duusare dharmon kaa anveshan kuch muslim kattarpanthi logon ke liye asahneeya tha
 He began to feel that Akbar was deviating from his religion
 in baton main kuch sachai bhi thi, akbar ne kai baar rudhivaadee islam se hat kar bhi kuch faisle liye, yahan tak ki 1582 main usne ek naye sampradaay kii hi shuruyaat kar di jise deen-e-ilaahi yani ishwar kaa dharm kaha gaya
 Akbar created a new religion called din-i-ilahi in 1582, in which the core elements of all religions were inserted, mainly Hindu and Islam religions
 inke alaava parsi, jain evam isai dharm ke mul vichaaron ko bhi sammilit kiya
 However, he did not do much industry for the promotion of this religion, but only included his trusted people in it
 kaha jaataa hai ki akbar ke alaava keval raja birbal hi mrityu tak is ke anuyaayi the
 According to dabestan-e-mazhab, only 19 people adopted this religion after Akbar
 kalantar main akbar ne ek nae panchang kii rachana kii jisame ki usne ek ishwariya samvath ko armbh kiya jo uske hi rajbhishek ke din se prarambh hota tha
 He wrote "allah-o-akbar" on the back of the coins which was the word Anakarthi
 akbar kaa shabdic arth he "mahaan" or ‘‘allaah-o-akbar’’ shabd ke do arth ho sakate the "allaah mahaan hai " yaa "akbar hi allaah hai"
 din-e-ilahi was, in true sense, a religion rather than a code of conduct
 isame bhoga, ghamand, ninda karnaa yaa dosha lagaana varjit the evam inhe paap kaha gaya
 Kindness, thoughtfulness and moderation were its pillars
 yah tark diya gaya he ki deen-e-ilaihi kaa ek nayaa dharm hone kaa siddhant galat dharna he, jo ki baad main british itihaaskaaron dwaara abul fazal ke kaaryon ke galat anuwaad ke kaaran paidaa hua tha
 However, it is also accepted that the policy of sulah-i-kul, which had the essence of din-i-ilahi, was adopted by Akbar not just for religious purposes but as a part of the general imperial administrative policy
 isane akbar kii dharmik sahanubhuti kii niti kaa aadhaar banaaya
 At the time of Akbar's death in 1605 there was no sign of dissatisfaction among his Muslim subjects, and a theologian like Abdul Haq had the impression that close relations remained
 nirakshar hote hui bhi akbar ko kalakaaron evam buddhijivio se vishesh prem tha
 Due to this love of his, there were nine very quality courtiers in Akbar's court which is also known as Akbar's Navratna
 akbar kaa vyaktitv bahucharchit rahaa he
 Therefore, Indian literature and cinema have created many characters inspired by Akbar

 Except for the hieroglyphs of the Indus Valley, Kharoshthi is one of the two oldest scripts in India
 yah daayen se baayein ko likhi jaati thi
 Emperor Ashoka has written the inscriptions of Shahbazgarhi and Mansehra in Kharoshthi script itself
 iske prachlan kii desh or kaalparak seemayen brahmi kii apeksha sankuchit raheen or bina kisi pratinidhi lipi ko janm die hi desh se iskaa lop bhi ho gaya
 The existence of another sophisticated script like Brahmi or the natural tendency to write from left to right of the country may have been the reason for the extinction of this script
 prarambh main iske padhane kaa prayaas karanevaale europea vidwaanon ne ise bactrean, indo-bactro-pali yaa ariuno-pali jaise naam die the
 The name Kharoshthi is in the list of 64 scripts mentioned in Lalitavistar
 iske naam kii vyutpatti ke sambandh main anek mat hai jinamein sarvaadhik maanya prajluski kaa he
 According to him, the basic of Kharoshthi is Kharpost
 post irani bhashaa kaa vah shabd he jiskaa arth 'khaal' hota he
 In Mahamayuri, Kharposta is the name of a corporator from northwest India
 chini parampara ke anusaar iskaa avishkaar rishi kharoshth ne kiya tha
 Whatever the derivation of the name of the script, there is no doubt that in this country it came from the northwest and, for some time, except Ashoka, used only by foreign princes in their own sphere of influence, ended with them
 kharoshtee lipi ke udhaaharan prastarshilpon, dhaatunirmit patron, bhaandon, sikkon, murtiyon tathaa bhurjpatr aadi par uplabdh hue hai
 The earliest accounts of Kharoshthi have been found from Taxila and around Char, but its main area was North Western India and Eastern Afghanistan
 mathura se bhi kuch kharoshtee abhilekh praapt hue hai
 Apart from these, the letters or words written in Kharoshthi have also been found from Siddapur in South India, Ujjain and Mysore
 mukhya seemaa ke uttar evam uttar purvi pradeshon se bhi kharoshtee lekhonvaale sikke, murtiyan tathaa kharoshtee main likhe hue pracheen granth uplabdh hue hai
 BC From the fourth to the third century CE, Kharoshthi was prevalent in northwestern India up to Mathura
 kushanyug ke baad is lipi kaa bharat se baahar chini turkistan main pravesh hua or kam se kam ek shatabdi vah vahaan jivit rahi
 The most popular opinion regarding the emergence of Kharoshthi is that the Hakhamani rulers had to adopt the Armaei script used in Assuria and Babylon for governance purposes, and with its rule, it entered northwest India
 aavashyaktavash kuch bharatiyon ko ise siikhnaa padaa, kintu baad main brahmi ke siddhanton ke aadhaar par isamen parivartan hue or is prakaar kharoshtee kaa janm hua
 Its promotion mainly in the territory occupied by Iran of India, the use of ancient Persian scripts and the scriptural words derived from it in the records of Ashoka, the absence of ellipses, the existence of Kharoshthi letters with Brahmi letters on Iranian hurt coins and some of the Kharoshthi characters
 Equivalence with armae varna and the emergence of armae varna from many are nutrients of this belief

 Its characteristics and the cursive nature of varnas prove that it was the script of clerks and merchants etc
 But the manuscript obtained from Khotan written in Khoshasti also proves the existence of a second sophisticated form, which was used in the writing of scriptures

 The method of making alcohol, alcoholic beverages and fuel containing alcohol is called alcoholism
 kinvan kii kriya dwaara sookshmjeev jaise kavak, sharkara ko alcohol main parivartit karte hai, isi siddhanth kaa prayog madhkaran main kiya jaataa he
 Alcoholism has a long history
 aadhunik yug main sookshmjaiviki kii takneeko ne ise ek labhjanak auddogik vyavsaay kaa rup de diya he
 The specialty of alcoholic drinks depends not only on the raw materials in use, but also on the taste and flavor of the preparation
 prayek sura kii apni visheshta hoti he or isamen upasthit alcodaul kii maatra utani mahatvapurn nahin hoti jitna uskaa swaad, suvaas tathaa anya "nijee visheshtaayen"
 Alcohol has been used as a stimulant drink since ancient times
 aswan kii kriya apekshaakrit baad main apanaai gai, parantu uske bahut pehle se fal, eekh, tad aadi ke kinvit rason kaa upyog uttejk tathaa swasthyavardhak peya ke rup main hota tha
 In India too, these types of beverages were used in the ancient times in the form of somaras, madhviras, aromatic juices etc
 bharat main vividh prakaar kii jadi bootiyon ke nishkarsh se sanmishrit sura kaa upyog aushadh ke rup main hota tha tathaa aaj bhi puraane granthon main is prakaar kii sanmishrit suraaon ko taiyaar karne ke anek nuskhe milte hai
 These were mainly produced by ascetics, doctors and alchemists and special skills were adopted in the selection of herbs, herbs, fruits and other plant materials used
 inase sambandhit baton ko praaia: gupt rakhaa jaataa tha
 These drinks were of special taste, taste and quality and India was a leader in this world among other countries of the world
 sura ke is gun ke kaaran europe main asut sura ko "jivan jal" kaa naam diya gaya, kyonki un logon main dhire dhire yah vishwaas fail gaya ki isamen jeevanaraksha ke tatv upasthit hai
 Distilled alcoholic beverages are of two types: first are drinks that are obtained directly by distillation
 is varg ke peya madhkaran udyog main adhik mahatvapurn hai
 The second class consists of beverages that have one or more ingredients mixed in the original distillate to bring some special and desirable characteristics to the ultimately obtained sura
 sura main alcodaul kaa sandarbh ethil alcodaul se hota he, yadhyapi sabhi apitu sura main alp maatra main ucchtar alcodaul bhi upasthit hota he
 Alcohol used in industrial use is produced from sugars, or substances that can be converted into sugars, such as starch
 alcoholyukt peya tathaa asut sura ke utpaadan main kramash: falon tathaa eekh ke ras kaa tathaa anaaj kaa upyog hota he
 Beer, whiskey etc
 are produced from grains
 brandi, angoor tathaa ram, eekh ke ras se taiyaar kii jaati he
 The raw material that is used for the amount of alcohol in sura, is often the reason for the characterization of the endogenous and flavor properties of the finally prepared sura
 purnat: shuddh kii hui udasin sura ethil alcodaul hoti he
 It can be obtained from any of the above written raw materials by distillation at 190 ° proof, or above
 aswan ke uparaant praapt asut ke pruf ko praaia: kam kiya jaataa he
 The concentration of alcoholic beverages is often expressed in "degree proof" or simply "proof"
 america kii paribhaasha ke anusaar pruf spirit us alcoholyukt drav ko kehete hai, jisamen 60 degree fahrenheit taap par 0
7939 vishisht gurutv kaa alcodaul, drav ke aaytan ke aadhe pariman main, upasthit ho
 In other words, the number of proofs is twice the volume of the alcohol volume
 britain main pruf spirit us alcoholyukt drav ko kehete hai jiskaa bhaar 51 degree fahrenheit taap par samaan aaytan ke asut jal ke bhaar kaa 92 / 93 ho
 There are two types of Sura: Riju Distilled Sura and Madhvira and Cordial
 ruju asut sura --isamen hviski, brandi, ram tathaa jin pramukh hai
 The fermented distillate of powdered grains, or a mixture of several types of grains, is called whiskey
 hviski ke utpaadan main jis anaaj kaa adhiktam upyog hua ho, usee anaaj ke naam par hviski kaa naam pradaan kiya jaataa he, jaise gehun kii hviski, malt hviski aadi
 Malt whiskey is prepared using fermented barley
 hsviki do prakaar kii hoti he amishrit hviski tathaa vishesh gunayukt sanmishrit hviski 
 Generally distilled from the fermented juices of fruits are called brandy
 yadi kisi falvishesh kaa ullekh nahin kiya gaya ho, to brandi kaa aashay angoor ke ras se praapt asut sura se hota he
 Brandy has a lot of characteristics of the fruit from which it is prepared
 eekh tathaa eekh ke sire ke kinvit asut ko ram kaha jaataa he
 Gin is produced by distillation of juniper berry aquaths and other solaric herbs
 madhvira -- ruju asut sura ke atirikt anya sura main madhvira tathaa cordial pramukh hai
 These contain 2
5 per cent sugar or glucose in addition to the amount of alcohol
 inkaa utpaadan udasin aasav, brandi, ram, jin, athwa anya asut sura ko falon, falon ke nishkarshan tathaa anya sourabhik or teevr suvaasavale padaarthon ke mishran se hota he
 The production of sura from starchy substances first involves converting starch into sugar
 parivartan kii yah kriya malt main upasthit diastess anzim dwaara sampann kii jaati he
 Almost all grains can be converted into malt form, but in normal state malt refers to sprouted barley
 malt kii kriya kaa uddeshy anaaj main anzim kaa vikaas karnaa hota he
 Malt not only converts the starch into sugars, but ultimately gives the sura its flavor and flavor
 malt kii utpatti kii ritiyon kii visheshta se scoch hviski kii visheshta maani jaati he
 Sura is produced from grains in five stages
 in kramon ko kramash: peesna, paak, sharkrakaran, avamishran tathaa kinvan kaha jaataa he
 Grinding grain is first order
 isamen chakkiyon main anaaj kaa baarik churna taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 This powder should neither be too thick nor too fine, because in both the stages there is difficulty in the methods of production and there is a hindrance in the recovery of sub-species
 anaaj kaa churna kaa adhikansh 10-30 akshi kii jaali se nikal sakane yogya hona chahie
 The second is the cooking sequence, in which the powder of the grain is mixed with water and mixed by the wilodakas
 is kriya main praaia: 56 pound anaaj se praapt churna ke liye 14 galen ke hisaab se mridu jal milaayaa jaataa he
 Samanging is done in very large tanks
 in tankiyon main vilodak lage rahete hai tathaa inhen garam karne ke liye inamen bhaap kii nalikaay hoti he
 In the culinary process, a mixture of cereal powder and water is heated
 garam karne kii avadhi main vilodakon ko nirantar chalaate rahanaa padataa he
 Due to the process of baking, starch of grain powder is cooked with water and made into paste
 kinvan kii kriya main anaaj ke churna kii apeksha lei kaa sharkrakaran sheeghra hota he
 Cooking is done in two ways: Firstly, baking is done for 30 to 60 minutes at 100 degree centigrade temperature in normal open air tanks
 yah reeti audyogikaran ke is yug main puraani ho chuki he
 Nowadays, most modern and other methods are used, in which time is saved
 is reeti main paak kii kriya band tankiyon main adhik taap par tathaa adhik hawa ke dabaav main kii jaati he
 The short time for the action is usually only five minutes
 kuch anaaj vishesh, jaise rai, ke upyog main paak kii kriya apekshaakrit kam taap par karnaa aavyak hota he, kyonki ucch taap par pakaane se taiyaar honevaali sura kaa swaad aruchikar hota he
 Samang lei is immediately cooled to 62 degree centigrade temperature after this process in the use of both baking methods
 thandha karne ke liye paak kii tankiyon main pani kii nalikaay lagi rahati hai
 In the third order, the starch of grains is sugared as lei
 is kriya se starch maltos main parivartit ho jaataa he
 This process is initiated by adding some quantity of powdered malt to the lei at 60 degree centigrade
 kriya ke samay lei tathaa malt ke mishran ko samang banaae rakhane ke liye, viloukon ko nirantar chalate rahanaa padataa he
 This process of sugarisation is stopped after 20 to 60 minutes
 is avadhi main lei main upasthit starch kaa 30 se 70 prati shat bhaag maltos main tathaa shesh bhaag kaa dextrin ke adhikansh kaa sharkara main parivartan ho jaataa he
 Maltose is mixed in the fourth order after the action of sugaring
 is kriya main sharkrakaran ke uparaant praapt dravya ko kinvan ke liye taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, the liquid is first cooled to the fermentation temperature and its concentration is brought to a certain extent by adding water, or the remaining liquid after the recovery of alcohol by distillation
 is kriya ko avamishran kaha jaataa he tathaa iskaa uddeshy kinvan ke liye drav ke taap tathaa sandratha ko nishchit str tak laana hota he, jisase kinvan niyantrit avasthaa main sampann kiya ja sake
 The fifth and final process of fermentation is most important in alcoholism
 kinvan kii kriya sharkara ko alcodaul main parivartit karti he
 This action is carried out by an enzyme complex called the enzyme enzyme
 alcodaul yukt peya ke utpaadan main praaia: khamir athwa secaromisij jati ke yeast kaa prayog hota he
 Zymez can also be obtained from other microbes
 secaromysis jati kaa yeast maltos ke drav main saralata se ugta he or sheeghra hi mukulan ke dwaara sanvardhan karata he
 Among the many species of Saccharomyces, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the most commonly used in the controlled fermentation of alcohols, although other variants are sometimes used
 kinvan kii kriya ek jatil prakram he
 In this, the exhaust of the gas of organic matter and heat is generated
 saadhaaran rup main ek anu glucose se kinvan ke prakram ke uparaant do anu ethil alcodaul tathaa do anu carbon dioxide praapt hote hai
 But the process of fermentation is not so simple and in addition to the above mentioned process there are many lateral processes, from which many minor products are obtained in small quantities
 parshv prakram prayog main aanevaale maltos drav kii saranchana yast tathaa kinvan kii paristhitiyon par bahut kuch nirbhar karti he
 These secondary sub-castes have a wide influence in alcoholization and provide flavor and flavor in the prepared sura
 gaun utpaada anek prakaar ke aldihide, aster, ucchtar alcodaul tathaa vasa amla ke rup main hote hai
 Higher alcohols are also named fusel oils
 taiyaar honevaali asut sura main gaun utpaadon kaa samuhik rup main saprajati bhi kaha jaataa he
 The fermentation process begins with the insertion of two to three percent of the mature yeast into the maltose liquid
 yah kriya do se chaar dinon main teen vishesh pravasthaon main purna hoti he
 In the first phase, yeast cells are cultured, in the second phase there is the main fermentation of maltose and other sugars, and in the third phase dextrin present with maltose is fermented into fermentable sugars and thereafter in completely ethyl alcohol
 duusari pravastha main teevr prakram hota he, jisame drav se dioxide gas ati sheeghra gati se nikalati he or drav ubalata sa maaloom padane lagata he, saath hi taap kii vruddhi hoti he
 Therefore, the fermentation fluid has to be kept cold
 taap ke prati yeast atyant sugrahi hota he
 Therefore, during the fermentation process, the temperature is carefully controlled between 82 ° to 86 ° F
 yeast ke taiyaar karne kii reeti maltos drav ko taiyaar karne ke samaan he
 The only difference is that the amount of water in it is less and hence water is added less in powdered powder
 yeast ke churna tathaa pani ke sandra mishran kaa, lactic amla bacteria se 20 ghante ke kinvan se, amleekaran kiya jaataa he
 Per 100 gallons of this acidified yeast fluid, 10 to 30 gallons of pre-sorted yeast are added by mixing
 kinvan kii kriya ke uparaant drav main alcodaul vaanchhneeya gaun utpaada, anaaj ke churna se shesh thos kan, khanij lavan, tathaa anya kinvan ke utpaada, jaise glishraal, lactic amla, saxinic amla, tarterik amla tathaa vasa amla, upasthit hote hai
 By the action of distillation, alcohol and other desired secondary products are separated from them
 aswan kii kriya ek, athwa do, asawanon dwaara sampann hoti he tathaa avaanchit tatwon ko sura se rahit karne ke liye bhinn bhinn aswan stambh evam bahukksheeya parishodhan stambh kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The basic action of distillation was done in antiquity in ancient times
 inamen ek bade ghat main alcoholyukt drav ko bharaa jaataa tha or ghat ke upar se nalikaaon dwaara alcodaul kaa vaashp ek anya paatr main sanghanit kiya jaataa tha
 This type of arrangement is called retort distillation
 ghat bhabhake se praapt pratham aswan kaa asut ashuddh hota he tathaa isamen alcodaul kii maatra 40 se 50 pruf hoti he
 Light saura obtained in this way is re-distilled two or three times, which gives concentric sura
 ye bhabhake praaia: taanbe ke bane hote hai or inhen pratyaksh athwa apratyaksh rup se garam kiya jaataa he
 Now-a-days improved Ghat Bhabhas are used in the production of whiskey and brandy
 ab ghat bhabhakon ke uparaant santat bhabhakon kaa upyog hone laga he
 In these, a continuous flow of hot fluid is made and perforated plates are placed in the oven
 garmi se platon ke upar alcodaul kaa vaashp banataa he or asut kaa pun: aswan hota rahata he
 The heated fluid going down the plates in the bhabhake is re-evaporated and the thickened liquid and sediment collected at the bottom of the bhabhake is removed from the bottom
 aajkal ke aadhunik bhabhakon main suvidhajanak or upyogi anek sudhaar kiye gaye hai, jinke kaaran aswan kii kriya na keval mitavyayi ho gai he, varan sabhi staron par kriya ko saraltapurvak niyantrit kiya ja sakaa he
 The characteristics of the Sura obtained from it can be changed at will
 madhkaran se sura ke atirikt upyogi upjaat bhi praapt kiye jate he
 The fluid left after the distillation of the sura, from which alcohol and other volatiles have been separated, is called Bhabhaka fluid
 bhabhake jal main anek padaarth vilyan main athwa nilamban kii avasthaa main upasthit hote hai
 Riboflavin and other components of the vitamin B-complex have been obtained from this fluid
 is drav kaa upyog pashuon ke bhojan sanmishranon main hota he

 ye vaanijya or vyavsaay se sambandhit hai
 The word Baniya is thought to be derived from the Sanskrit word commerce
 saamanyat: paisa udhaar dene waalon tathaa masaale evam aushadhi vanaspati, anaaj evam tel ke vyapaariyon kaa bhartiya jati, mukhyat: uttari or pashchimi bharat main pai jaati hai, haalaaki sankeern arth main kai vyapaaree samudaay banie nahin hai or vilomat: kuch banie vyapaaree nahin hai

, are considered members of the Vaishya varna in Indian society's enviable system
 dharmik arthon main ve saamanyat: vaishnav yaa jain hote hai Words like Pan, Panya, Pani have come up in the later Vedic period mentions

 The hatred of the Aryans towards the businessmen was natural
 arya aagatuk the or paniyon kaa pradhan vyavsaay vyapaar or len-dein tha
 Vanik is also born from the word panik or phanik
 aaryon ne paniyon kaa ullekh alag alag sandarbhon main kiya he magar har baar unke vyapaar patu hone kaa sanket zarur miltaa he
 The word commerce for trade is also prevalent in Hindi

 It is made from vanija which means merchant, businessman or Tularashi
 gauratlab he ki vyapaaree har kaam taul kar hi karata he
 The word Vanij is derived from Pan + igy according to Apte Kosh
 isse hi bana he “vaanijya” or “vanik” jo kaarobaari, vyapaaree athwa vaisya samudaay ke liye khub istemaal hota he
 Consider the similarity of the mercantile with the mercury

 Hakim Abul Qasim Firdausi was a Persian Persian poet

 In it, he wrote about Iran before Arabic Fatah on Persia in the seventh century

 main khurasaan ke toos naamak kasbe main hua
 a poet named Asadi taught him and inspired him towards poetry
 usne iran ke puranic raajaaon ke sambandh main use ek granth diya jiske aadhaar par firdausi ne shahname kii rachana kii
 It has 60,000 lions
 vah 35 varsh tak is mahaan kaary main vyast rahaa or 25 farvari 1010 i
 ko ise puraa kiya
 He was 85 at this time
 usne yah kavy sultan mahmud gazanvi ko samarpit kiya jisane 999 i
 main khurasaan vijay kar liya tha
 He was given only 20 thousand dirhams
 firdausi ke tan badan main aag lag gai
 He ran away from his country towards Hirat, but before fleeing, he added a poem to the Shahnama, which strongly condemns Sultan Mahmud
 shahname main firdausi ne iran ke puranic baadshahon kii, jinke karnaamon se vah atyadhik prabhavit tha, badi kii prashansa kii he
 His poetry reveals his love for ancient Iran and hatred for the Arabs
 sabhavat: kattar musalamaanon ko santusht karne ke liye usne baad main yusuf julykha naamak masanvi likhi jise bavahid shaasha bahauddaula tathaa uske putr sultanuddaula ko samarpit kiya
 He then returned to his homeland Tus and died there
 uski qabr iran ke darshneey sthanon main he
 It is said that as his janaza was leaving the gate of a nearby village, a caravan arrived with 60,000 dinars sent by Sultan Mahmud, whose poet had hoped

 Mahmud Ghaznavi is said to have pledged to Firdausi that he would give a dinar for every word of 'shahnama'
 varshon kii mehnat ke baad jab 'shahnamaa' taiyaar ho gaya or firdausi use lekar mahmud gazanabi ke darbar main gaya to samraat ne use prayek shabd ke liye ek dinar nahin balki ek dirham kaa bhugtan kara diya
 It is said that angry at this, Firdausi returned and did not even take a dirham
 yah vaayada kilaafi kuch aisi thi jaise kisi kavi ke prati shabd ek rupee dene kaa vachan dekar prati shabd ek paisa diya jaye
 Firdausi angrily wrote a few lines against Mahmud Ghaznabi
 ve panktiyaan itani prabhaavshaalee thi ki puure samrajya main fail gayin
 a few years later, his trusted ministers requested Mahmud Ghaznavi that Firdausi be paid at the same rate that was fixed
 samraat ke kaaran poochne par pradhanmantri ne kaha ki ham log samrajya ke jis kone main jate hai hamen ve panktiyaan sunne ko milti hai jo firdausi ne aapke viruddh likhi hai or hamaara sirf shame se jhuk jaataa he
 If he is given money at the prescribed rate, then we will get a lot of moral strength
 ' samraat ne aadesh de diya
 When a car full of dinars reached Firdausi's house, Firdausi's funeral was coming out from inside the house
 puri umr garibi, tangi or mufalisi main kaatane ke baad firdausi mar chukaa tha
 It is said that his girl, the only child of Firdausi, refused to take this paddy
 is tarah samraat kavi kaa karjadaar rahaa or aaj bhi he
 Perhaps this is the reason why Firdausi's Shahnama is as famous today or more famous as the lines that Firdausi wrote while criticizing Mahmud Ghaznabi
 firdausi kaa 'shahnamaa' darasal iran kaa itihaas hi nahin irani asmita kii pahchaan he
 It describes the achievements of ancient Iran
 samraaton kaa itihaas he
 The ancient Persian texts have been incorporated and given a new look
 myth or itihaas ke sammishran se ek adbhut prabhaav utpann hua he

 irani sahitya main 'shahnamaa' jitani tarah se jitani baar chapa he utana or koi pustak nahin chhapi he

 kautilya kaa 'arthshaastra' raajnneetik siddhanton kii ek mahatvapurn kriti he
 In this connection, the question arises why Kautilya named his book 'arthashastra'? In ancient times the term 'arthashastra' was used in a broader sense
 iske antagart multah raajnneetishastra, dharamshastra, arthshaastra, kanoon aadi kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa tha
 In the view of Acharya Kautilya, political science is an independent science and its branches are investigation, trilogy and dialogue and law
 sampoorn samaaj kii raksha raajnneeti yaa dand vyavastha se hoti he yaa rakshit praja hi apane-apane karttavya kaa paalan kar sakati he
 At that time economics was considered the scripture of politics and administration
 mahabharat main is sambandh main ek prasang he, jisamen arjuna ko arthshaastra kaa visheshgy mana gaya he
 Certainly, Kautilya's Arthashastra would also have been taken as a form of Rajashastra, as he has given many interpretations of the meaning
 kautilya ne kaha he— manuyana vrutirarthah arthath manushyon kii jeevika ko 'arth' kehete hai
 Explaining the Arthashastra, he has said - Tasya Prithivya Gnanapalanopaya: Shastra marth-shastramiti
 is prakaar yah bhi spasht he ki 'arthshaastra' ke antargat rajvyavastha or arthvyavastha donon se sambandhit siddhanton kaa samavesh he
 In fact, it would not be appropriate to call Kautilya 'arthashastra' only a scripture of polity and economy
 vastav main, yah arthvyavastha, rajvyastha, vidhi vyavastha, samaaj vyavastha or dharm vyavastha se sambandhit shaastra he
 Many other Arthasastras were composed before Kautilya's 'arthashastra', although his manuscripts are not available
 bharat main pracheen kaal se hi arth, kaam or dharm ke sanyog or sammilan ke liye prayaas kiye jate rahe hai or uske liye shastron, smritiyon or puraanon main vishad charchaayen kii gayi hai
 Kautilya has also explained the meaning of 'arthashastra', measures of attainment of Artha, Kama and Dharma
 vatsyayan ke 'kamasutra' main bhi arth, dharm or kaam ke sambandh main sutron kii rachana kii gayi he
