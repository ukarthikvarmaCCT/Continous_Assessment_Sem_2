 tatvamasi bharat ke puraatan hindu shastron va upanishdon main varnit chaar mahavakyon main se ek he, jiskaa shabdic arth he - "vah tum hi ho"
 xxrep 5 ★ Mahavakya is Tattvamasi xxrep 5 ★ tatvamasi kaa arth he, vah tu hi he
 He is not far, very close, more than near
 tera hona hi vahi he
 This is Mahavakya
 mahavakya kaa arth hota he ki agar is ek vaakya ko bhi pakad kar koi puraa anusandhan kar le, to jivan kii param sthiti ko uplabdh ho jaae
 Therefore it is called Mahavakya
 phir kisi shaastra kii koi bhi jarurat nahin he, or kisi veda or kisi quran or bible kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Tattvamasi is sufficient Veda
 is ek vaakya kaa koi thik se shravan kar le, manan kar le, nididhyasana kar le, samadhi kar le, to kisi or shaastra kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Mahavakya means: capitalized, in which everything has come
 yah mahavakya aadhyatmik chemistry kaa formula he
 There are three things said in this, that, that, you, you; Both are one - there are three things
 vah or tu ek hai, bas itnaa hi yah sutara he
 But all the Vedanta, all the experience of sages, comes in these three
 yah jo ganit jaisaa sutara he vah – astitv, paramatma or tu vah jo bheetar chhipi chetana he vah, ye do nahin hai, ye ek hai
 This is the essence of all Vedas, then everything else is spread
 isliye is tarah ke vaakya ko upanishdon main mahavakya kaha gaya he
 Such sentences should be heard in complete silence
 isliye hajaaron saal tak bharat main rishiyon kaa aagrah rahaa ki jo param shaan he, vah likhaa na jaae
 His request was very valuable
 lekin use puraa karnaa asambhav tha
 Had to write hajaaron saal tak yah aagrah rahaa ki jo param gyaan he, vah likhaa na jaae
 Many people, especially philologists, linguists think that since there was no script, there was no way to write, so Vedas and Upanishads were not written for a long time
 ve galat sochate hai
 Because those who could provide an experience like Tattvamsi, who could experience this Mahavakya, would not have discovered the art of writing, it seems impossible
 likhane kii kala to thi, lekin ve likhane ko raji nahin the
 Why? Because if such Mahavakyas are written, then everyone reads in every condition
 or padh kar is bhranti main pad jaataa he ki samaj gaye
 These sentences are listenable only under a particular quality, a particular state, a particular state of mind
 tabhi ye praanon main pravesh karte hai
 There is danger every time you listen
 khatre do hai ek to yah yaad ho jayega, or lagegaa maine jaan liya, or doosraa khatra yah he ki is jaankaree ke kaaran aap shaayad hi kabhi us manahosthiti ko banane kii taiyaari karen, jisamen ise suna janaa chahie tha

 Herbert Yefremov played an instrumental role in the development of this missile
 The first test of the brahmos missile was carried out on 12 June 2001 from the integrated test site at Chandipur in the Orissa coastal region
 So far several versions of its ramjet technology have been developed
 Based brahmos supersonic missile with 200-300 kg payload can penetrate its targets at a distance of 300 km
 From the ground, the air, the submarines, It can also be launched from anywhere, from the Battle Poto
 The brahmos Cenuvrable version has also been tested so that its route can be changed before it reaches its target after being launched
 There is also a plan to build a sonic missile missile, which will be able to hit its targets at the speed of 7 MAC
 This will have to be done on its own with the aid of Russia, as Russia has signed an international missile technology control treaty, due to which it cannot help other countries in developing a missile with a range of more than 300 km

 Old history samakaleen itihaas The history of South Sudan includes the history of the present South Sudan region and its inhabitants
 dakshin sudan 2011 main sudan ganraajya se alag hokar ek desh bana
 Geographically, no region of South Sudan is part of the Sudan region and constitutes itself as part of sub-saharan Africa
 aadhunik shabdaawalee main isamen purvi sudani savana kshetra ke bhaag bhi shaamil hai
 Its inclusion in "sudan" was attributed to the expansion of the Osmani Empire in the 19th century, and the subsequent inclusion of Mahdia Sudan, anglo-egyptian Sudan and the Republic of Sudan from 1885 to 2011
 dakshin sudan main nilo-sahaara bhashiyon kii bahulata he or nizer-congou bhashi alpsankhyak hai
 Historically, the present-day South Sudan center was dominated by a majority of Sudan speakers, but the presence of the Nilot tribe has also been considered since prehistoric times
 chaudaavin sadi ke samakaleen samay main makuria or alodiya isai nubian samrajya ke vighatan ke baad se hi nilotic log dhire-dhire is kshetra main badhane lag gayi
 Until about 1500 South Sudan was mostly controlled by speakers of Central Sudanic languages
 Linguistic evidence shows that over time Nilotic speakers, such as the Dinka, Shilluk, and Luo, took over
 These groups who currently live around the Sudd marshlands migrated down Southward from Northern and Central Sudan around the time of the collapse of Nubia and the strives that ensued among the many people who were ruled by the Kings of Nubia
 Archaeological evidence shows that a culture based on transhumant cattle raising has been present in that area since 3000 BCE, and the Nilotic culture in that area may thus be continuous to that date
 Archaeological evidence as well as the physical evidence in the livlihood of the Nilotes including their dome-shaped houses and tukuls shows that they may have made an enormous contribution to the governance and wealth of the Nubia Kingdom before and during the 25th Dynasty
 a few Central Sudanic groups remain such as the Mari and the Moru
 The Nilotic expansion seems to have begun in the 14th century
 This coincides with the collapse of the Christian Nubian kingdoms of Makuria and Alodia and the penetration of Arab traders into central Sudan
 From the Arabs the South Sudanese may have obtained new breeds of hump-less cattle
 Archaeologist Roland Oliver notes that the period also shows an Iron Age beginning among the Nilotics
 These factors may explain how the Nilotic speakers expanded to dominate the region
 One theory is that it was pressure from the Shilluk that drove the Funj people north, who would establish the Sultanate of sennar
the Dinka remained in the Sudd area, maintaining their transhumance economy
 The Shilluk spread east to the banks of the white Nile by the 16th century under the legendary leadership of Nyikang, who is said to have the Shilluk c
1490 to c
1517
 The Shilluk gained control of the west bank of the river as far north as Kosti in Sudan
 There they established an economy based on cattle raising, cereal farming, and fishing, with small villages located along the length of the river
 The Shilluk developed an intensive system of agriculture, and the Shilluk lands in the 17th century had a population density similar to that of the Egyptian Nile lands
 While the Dinka were protected and isolated from their neighbours, the Shilluk were more involved in international affairs
 The Shilluk controlled the west bank of the White Nile, but the other side was controlled by the Funj Sultanate, and there were regular conflict between the two
 The Shilluk had the ability to quickly raid outside areas by war canoe, and had control of the waters of the Nile
 The Funj had a standing army of armoured cavalry, and this force allowed them to dominated the plains of the sahel
 Shilluk traditions tell of King Odak Ocollo who ruled c
 1630 and led them in a three decade war with Sennar over control of the White Nile trade routes
 The Shilluk allied with the Sultanate of Darfur and the Kingdom of Takali against the Funj, but the capitulation of Takali ended the war in the Funj's favor
 In the later 17th century the Shilluk and Funj allied against the Jieng, a group of Dinka who rose to power in the border area between the Funj and Shilluk
 The Shilluk political structure gradually centralized under the a king or reth
 The most important is Reth Tugo who ruled c
 1690 to 1710 and established the Shilluk capital of Fashoda
 The same period saw the gradual collapse of the Funj sultanate, leaving the Shilluk in complete control of the White Nile and its trade routes
 The non-nilotic Azande people, who entered southern Sudan in the 16th century, established the region's largest state
 The Azande are the third largest nationality in Southern Sudan
 They are found in maridi,iba, yambio<nzara,ezon, Tambura and Nagere Counties in the tropical rain forest belt of western Equatoria and Bahr el Ghazal
 In the 18th century, the Avungara people entered and quickly imposed their authority over the Azande
 Avungara power remained largely unchallenged until the arrival of the British at the end of the 19th century
 Geographical barriers protected the southerners from Islam's advance, enabling them to retain their social and cultural heritage and their political and religious institutions
 The Dinka people were especially secure in the Sudd marshlands, which protected them from outside interference, and allowed them to remain secure without a large armed forces
 The Shilluk, Azande, and Bari people had more regular conflicts with neighboring states
 In 1821 the Sennar Sultanate to the north collapsed in the face of an invasion by Egypt under the Muhammad Ali Dynasty
 After consolidating their control over northern Sudan, the Egyptian forces began to foray south
 In 1827 Ali Khurshid Pasha led a force through the Dinka lands and in 1830 led an expedition to the junction of the White Nile and the Sobat
 The most successful missions were led by Admiral Salim Qabudan who between 1839 and 1842 sailed the White Nile, reaching as far south as modern Juba
 The Egyptian forces attempted to set up forts and garrisons in the region, but disease and defection forced their quick abandonment
 While claimed by the Khedives of Egypt, they had no real authority over the region
 In 1851, under pressure from foreign powers, the government of Egypt opened the region to European merchants and missionaries
 The Europeans found a large supply of ivory, but found the local Bari had little interest in anything they were selling
 As a result the merchants often turned to force, seizing the ivory, even this proved not to be economical and the merchant ventures had little success
 Christian missionaries also established posts in the region, with the Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Central Africa, covering the region
 The missionaries also had little impact on the region in the early 19th century
 The lack of formal authority was filled in the 1850s by a set of powerful merchant princes
 In the east Muhammad Ahmad al-aqqad controlled much land, but the most powerful was al-zubayr Rahma Mansur who came to control the Bahr el Ghazal and other parts of South Sudan
 al-zubayr was a merchant from Khartoum, who hired his own private army and marched south
 He set up a network of trading forts known as zaribas through the region, and from these forts controlled local trade
 The most valuable commodity was ivory
 In previous centuries Sudanese merchants had not placed a high price on ivory, but the period of Egyptian rule coincided with a great increase in global demand as middle class Americans and Europeans began to purchase pianos and billiard balls
 To manage the trade al-zubayr needed labor, and thus also began to capture a significant number of slaves
 To his mercenary force, he also conscripted a large slave army
 Due to trade disputes with the Sultanate of Darfur al-zubayr went to war against that kingdom and in 1874 defeated their forces and killed Ibrahim, the last Fur Sultan
 The Khedive of Egypt, Isma'il Pasha, was concerned over the growing power al-zubayr, and established the province of Equatoria and planned to colonized the area
 Isma'il hired the British explorer Samuel Baker in 1869 to govern the area, and supplied him with soldiers and generous financing, but Baker was unable to extend Egyptian power over the area
 To dispose of al-zubayr, Isma'il dispatched the mercenary leader Muhammed al-bulalwi and promised him the governorship of Bahr el Ghazal, if he defeated al-zubayr
 Instead al-zubayr routed the invaders and killed al-bulalwi
 In 1873 Isma'il thus agreed to appoint al-zubayr as governor
 Isma'il was still threatened by al-zubayr and his independent base of power
 The British media was also filled with stories about al-zubayr the "slaver King
" In 1874 Charles George Gordon was appointed governor of Equatoria
 In 1877 al-zubayr travelled to Cairo to ask for the governoship of Darfur as well, but was placed under house arrest by Is'mail
 Gordon defeated al-zubayr's son, ending the merchants' control of the region
 Despite this, Gordon still failed to exert authority over any territory in the region beyond the lands immediately around his few forts
 In 1878, Gordon was replaced by Emin Pasha
 The Mahdist Revolt did not spread south to the non-muslim region, but cut off the South Sudan from Egypt, leaving Emin Pasha isolated and without resources
 He was rescued in a mission led by Henry Morton Stanley
 Equatoria ceased to exist as an Egyptian outpost in 1889
 Important settlements in Equatoria included Lado, Gondokoro, Dufile and Wadelai
 In 1947, British hopes to join the southern part of Sudan with Uganda were dashed by the Juba Conference, to unify northern and southern Sudan
 The region has been negatively affected by two civil wars since Sudanese independence, resulting in serious neglect, lack of infrastructural development, and major destruction and displacement
 More than 2
5 million people have been killed, and more than five million have become externally displaced while others have been internally displaced, becoming refugees as a result of the civil war and war-related effects
 In 1955, one year before Sudan achieved independence, the First Sudanese Civil War started, with aims of achieving representation and more regional autonomy
 For seventeen years, the Sudanese government fought the Anyanya rebel army
 In 1971, former army Lt
 Joseph Lagu gathered all the guerilla bands under his South Sudan Liberation Movement 
 This was the first time in the history of the war that the separatist movement had a unified command structure to fulfill the objectives of secession and the formation of an independent state in South Sudan
 It was also the first organization that could claim to speak for, and negotiate on behalf of, the entire south
 Mediation between the World Council of Churches and the All Africa Conference of Churches eventually led to the signing of the Addis Ababa Agreement in 1972, which established the Southern Sudan Autonomous Region
 In 1983, President of Sudan Gaafar Nimeiry declared all Sudan an Islamic state under Shari'a law, including the non-islamic majority southern region
 The Southern Sudan Autonomous Region was abolished on 5 june 1983, ending the Addis Ababa Agreement
 In direct response to this, the Sudan People's Liberation Army / Movement was formed under the leadership of John Garang, and the Second Sudanese Civil War erupted
 Several factions split from the SPLA often along ethnic lines and were funded and armed by Khartoum, with the most notable being the spla-nasir in 1991 led by Riek Machar
 As a result of the infighting, more southerners died at each other's hands than were killed by northerners during the war
 In the Bor massacre in 1991, an estimated 2000 civilians were killed by spla-nasir and armed Nuer civilians and another estimated 25,000 died from the resulting famine in the following years
 This war lasted for twenty-two years, becoming the longest civil war in Africa
 In 2005, Comprehensive Peace Agreement, mediated by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, as well as igad-partners, a consortium of donor countries, was signed in Nairobi and autonomous Government of Southern Sudan was formed
 This agreement lasted until 2011, when South Sudan declared independence
 From 9–15 January 2011 people from South Sudan voted on whether they should break away from Sudan and declare independence
 On 30 January 2011, the results had shown that 98
83% of the population had voted for independence from Sudan
 At midnight on 9 july 2011, South Sudan became an independent country under the name Republic of South Sudan
 On 14 july 2011, South Sudan became the 193rd member state of the United Nations
 On 28 july 2011, South Sudan joined the African Union as its 54th member state
 Certain disputes still remain with Sudan, such as sharing of the oil revenues, as an estimated 80% of the oil in both Sudans is from South Sudan, which would represent amazing economic potential for one of the world's most deprived areas
 The region of Abyei still remains disputed and a separate referendum is due to be held in Abyei on whether they want to join North or South Sudan
 South Sudan is currently at war with at least seven armed groups
 According to UN figures, the various conflicts affect nine of its ten states, with tens of thousands displaced
 The fighters accuse the government of plotting to stay in power indefinitely, not fairly representing and supporting all tribal groups while neglecting development in rural areas
 Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army also operates in a wide area that includes South Sudan
 In the SPLA / M's attempt to disarm rebellions among the Shilluk and Murle, they burned scores of villages, raped hundreds of women and girls and killed an untold number of civilians
 Civilians alleging torture claim fingernails been torn out, burning plastic bags dripped on children to make their parents hand over weapons and villagers burned alive in their huts if rebels were suspected of spending the night there
 In May 2011, the SPLA allegedly set fire to over 7,000 homes in Unity State
 The UN reports many of these violations and the frustrated director of one Juba-based international aid agency calls them "human rights abuses off the Richter scale"
 In 2010, the CIA issued a warning that "over the next five years, 


 a new mass killing or genocide is most likely to occur in southern Sudan
" Inter-ethnic fighting intensified in 2011 in Jonglei state between the Nuer White Army of the Lou Nuer and the Murle
 The White Army warned it would also fight South Sudanese and UN forces
 The White Army released a statement, to "wipe out the entire Murle tribe on the face of the earth as the only solution to guarantee long-term security of Nuer's cattle
" Activists, including Minority Rights Group International, warn of genocide in the current Jonglei conflict
 In March 2012, the Sudanese Air Force bombed areas of the South Sudanese state of Unity, near the border of the Sudanese province of South Kordofan
 South Sudanese forces responded by seizing the Heglig oil field on April 10
 Sudanese troops launched a counter offensive and forced the South Sudanese Army to withdraw nine days later
 On 20 april South Sudan announced it had begun a phased withdrawal from Heglig, while Sudan claimed it took it by force
 Afterwards, Sudanese president Omar al-bashir held a victory rally in Khartoum
 On 22 April more fighting broke out on the border as Sudanese soldiers backed by tanks and artillery launched three waves of attacks six miles deep inside South Sudan
 At least one South Sudanese soldier was killed and two wounded in the attack
 The two parties recommenced negotiations in June 2012 under mediation by the African Union's envoy Thabo Mbeki
 On 27 September Sudanese President Omar al-bashir and South Sudanese President Salva Kiir signed eight agreements in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which led the way to resume important oil exports and create a six-mile demilitarized zone along their border
 The agreements allows for the return of 350,000 barrels of South Sudanese oil to the world market
 In addition, the agreements include an understanding on the parameters to follow in regards to demarcating their border, an economic-cooperation agreement and a deal to protect each other's citizens
 Certain issues remain unsolved and future talks are scheduled to resolve them
 At the same time as the ongoing general debate of the sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly on the same day, South Sudan was scheduled to speak
 In mid-march 2013, both countries began to withdraw their forces from the border area in a bit to creating a demilitarised buffer zone and resume South Sudanese oil production for export through Sudan
 In early April South Sudanese oil started to flow through pipelines in Sudan again
 Though Sudanese President Omar al-bashir threatened to cut oil transit through his country from South Sudan, South Sudanese President Salvar Kiir accused him of mobilising for war and said that he would not go to war over the oil transit issue
 On 6 June 2011 armed conflict broke out between the forces of Northern and Southern Sudan, ahead of the scheduled independence of the South on 9 July
 This followed an agreement for both sides to withdraw from Abyei
 By late June, several international interlocutors including the United Nations advanced a proposal to base 4,200 Ethiopian soldiers in Abyei to serve as peacekeepers
 President Salva Kiir alleged that on 14 December 2013, a faction of the Sudan People's Liberation Army loyal to former vice president Riek Machar attempted a coup d'état and that the attempt was put down the next day
 However, fighting has continued
 Machar denied trying to start a coup and called for Kiir to resign
 At least 500 were reported to have died and over 400 injured
 There are reports of people fleeing clashes in Bor, the capital of Jonglei state
