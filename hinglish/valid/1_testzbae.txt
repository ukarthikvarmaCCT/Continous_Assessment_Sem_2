 In its early times, medicine was studied in the same way as a branch of biology
 baad main 'sharir rachana' tathaa 'sharir kriya vigyaan' aadi ko iskaa aadhaar banaaya gaya
 The birth of medicine in India was several thousand years BC
 It was initially studied as a branch of biology, and anatomy and physiology were made the basis of it
 sharir main honevaali kriyaaon ke gyaan se pataa laga ki unka rup bahut kuch rasinic he or ye ghatnaayen raasaanik kriyaaon ke fal hai
 As soon as the discovery took place, the chemical form of the events of the body came out
 is prakaar rasayan vigyaan kaa itnaa mahatv badha ki vah ayurvigyaan kii ek pruthak shakha ban gaya, jiskaa naam jeevarsayan rakhaa gaya
 By this, not only the form of physical events became clear, but also the origin of diseases and methods of resistance came out
 saath hi bhautik vigyaan ne bhi shaareerik ghatnaon ko bhalee bhanti samajhane main bahut sahaayta di
 It is known that many events happen according to physical rules
 ab jeevarsayan kii bhanti jeevbhautikee bhi ayurvigyaan kaa ek ang ban gai he or usase bhi rogon kii utpatti ko samajhane main tathaa unka pratirodh karne main bahut sahaayta mili he

 Many kinds of experimental methods and instruments, which have been made from time to time, have been very helpful in acquiring a subtle knowledge of the body, physical phenomena and internal functions related to the disease

 Day by day, the doctor has to depend on laboratories and equipment and this dependency is increasing progressively
 prayek shiksha kaa dhyey manushya kaa maansik vikaas hota he, jisase usamen tark karke samajhane or tadnusaar apane bhaavon ko prakat karne tathaa karyanvit karne kii shakti utpann ho jaay
 This is also the aim of medical education
 iske liye sab ayurvigyaan ke vidhyaarthiyon main vidhyaarthee ko upasnaatak ke rup main paanch varsh bitaane padate hai
 In medical colleges, students are admitted on the basis of studying the basic sciences and getting higher secondary education

 Thereafter, he can join a department to get a diploma or degree in postgraduate teaching

 The aim of every teacher and student of medical schools should also be that he should try to advance the art of this antidote by searching for new anti-inflammatory items
 itnaa hi nahin, shikshakon kaa jeevanalakshya yah bhi hona chahie ki vah aise anveshak utpann karen

 bharat kaa vibhaajan mountbeton yojana ke aadhaar par nirmit bhartiya swatantraaa adhinium 1947 ke aadhaar par kiya gaya
 It was said in this act that on 15 August 1947, two autonomous investments will be made called the Dominion of India and Pakistan and the British Government will hand over power to them
 swatantraaa ke saath hi 14 agast ko pakistan adhirajya or 15 agast ko bhartiya sangh kii sansthapana kii gai
 In this development, mainly the province of Bengal in British India was divided into East Pakistan and West Bengal state of India and similarly Punjab province of British India was divided into Punjab province of western Pakistan and Punjab state of India
 isi dauraan british bharat main se ceylone or burma ko bhi alag kiya gaya, lekin ise bharat ke vibhaajan main nahin shaamil kiya jaataa he
 Similarly, the partition of Pakistan in 1971 and the establishment of Bangladesh are also not counted in this development
 15 agast 1947 kii aadhi raat ko bharat or pakistan kanoonee taur par do swatantra raashtra bane
 But Pakistan's power conversion rituals were performed in Karachi on 14 August so that the last British Viceroy Louis Mountbatten, both in Karachi and New Delhi could participate in the rituals
 isliye pakistan main swatantraaa diwas 14 agast or bharat main 15 agast ko manaaya jaataa he
 Crores of people were affected by the partition of India
 vibhaajan ke dauraan hui hinsa main kareeb 5 lakh log maare gaye or kareeb 1
45 karod sharnaarthiyon ne apana ghar-baar chhodkar bahumat sampradaay vaale desh main sharan lee
 The British rulers of India always followed the policy of "divide and rule" in India
 unhone bharat ke nagarikon ko sampradaay ke anusaar alag-alag samoohon main baant kar rakhaa
 Some of his policies discriminated against Hindus and some against Muslims
 20veen sadi aate-aate musalmaan hinduon ke bahumat se darane lage or hinduon ko lagane laga ki british sarkaar or bhartiya netaa musalamaanon ko visheshadhikaar dene or hinduon ke prati bhedbhaav karne main lage hai
 Therefore, when the spirit of independence began to emerge in India, the leaders of both sects were competing in controlling the freedom struggle
 san 1906 main dhaka main bahut se musalmaan netaaon ne milakar muslim lig kii sthapana kii
 These leaders were of the view that Muslims had less rights than majority Hindus and that the Indian National Congress represented Hindus
 muslim lig ne alag-alag samay par alag-alag maangen rakhin
 In a speech by the famous Urdu poet Muhammad Iqbal at the conference of the Muslim League in 1930, for the first time raised the demand for a separate state for Muslims
 1935 main sindh praant kii vidhaan sabha ne bhi yahi maang uthaai
 Iqbal and Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar asked Muhammad Ali Jinnah to support this demand
 is samay tak jinna hindu-muslim ekta ke paksh main lagate the, lekin dhire-dhire unhone aarope lagaana shuru kar diya ki congressi netaa musalamaanon ke hiton par dhyaan nahin de rahe
 At the 1940 Muslim League Conference in Lahore, Jinnah clearly stated that he wanted two different nations
 hindu mahasabha jaise hindu sanghathan bharat ke bantwaare ke prabal virdohi the, lekin maanate the ki hinduon or musalamaanon main matbhed hai
 In a speech at the conference of Hindu Mahasabha in Allahabad in 1937, Veer Savarkar said - India is not a nation today, there are two nations here - Hindu and Muslim
 congress ke adhiktar netaa panth-nirpeksh the or sampradaay ke aadhaar par bharat kaa vibhaajan karne ke viruddh the
 Mahatma Gandhi believed that Hindus and Muslims could live together and they should live together
 unhone vibhaajan kaa ghor virodh kiya: "meri puri aatma is vichaar ke viruddh vidroh karti he ki hindu or musalmaan do virdohi mat or samskritiyaan hai
 To approve such a doctrine is like rejecting God for me
 " bahut saalon tak gandhi or unke anuyaayiyon ne koshish kii ki musalmaan congress ko chhod kar na jaaen or is prakriya main hindu or musalmaan garam dalon ke netaa unase bahut chidh gaye
 The British plannedly promoted suspicion of both Hindu and Muslim sects
 muslim lig ne agast 1946 main sidhi kaarywahi diwas manaaya or kalakatta main bheeshan dange kiye jisamen kareeb 5000 log maare gayi or bahut se ghayal hue
 In such an environment, all the leaders were under pressure to accept the partition so that the country does not come completely into a state of war
 bharat ke vibhaajan ke dhaanche ko '3 june plan' yaa mountbaton yojana kaa naam diya gaya
 The boundary between India and Pakistan was set by Sir Cyril Radcliffe, a London lawyer
 hindu bahumat vaale ilaake bharat main or muslim bahumat vaale ilaake pakistan main shaamil kiye gaye
 On 18 July 1947, the British Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act which finalized the process of partition
 is samay british bharat main bahut se rajya the jinke raajaaon ke saath british sarkaar ne tarah-tarah ke samjhaute kar rakhe the
 These 565 states were given the freedom to choose who they would like to join India or Pakistan
 adhiktar rajyon ne bahumat dharm ke aadhaar par desh chunaa
 There was a lot of controversy in the integration of the states whose rulers chose the country which suited the majority religion
 vibhaajan ke baad pakistan ko sanyukt raashtra main nae sadsy ke rup main shaamil kiya gaya or bharat ne british bharat kii kursi sanbhali
 The wealth of British India was shared between the two countries but this process began to drag on for too long
 gandhiji ne bharat sarkaar par dabaav daalaa ki vah pakistan ko dhan jaldi bheje jabaki is samay tak bharat or pakistan ke bich yuddh shuru ho chukaa tha or dabaav badhaane ke liye anshan shuru kar diya
 The Indian government had to succumb to this pressure and send money to Pakistan
 22 oktober 1947 ko pakistan ne kashmir par akraman kar diya, usase purv mountbaton ne bharat sarkaar se pakistan sarkaar ko 55 karod rupee kii raashi dene kaa paraamarsh diya tha
 The Union Cabinet decided to postpone giving this amount in view of the attack but at the same time Gandhi started a fast-unto-death to get this amount immediately, as a result of which this amount was given to Pakistan against the interests of India
 nathuram godse ne mahatma gandhi ke is kaam ko unki hatya karne kaa ek kaaran bataaya
 Many scholars believe that the British government did not handle the process of partition properly
 chunki swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa pehle or vibhaajan kii ghoshnaa baad main kii gayi, desh main shanti kaayam rakhane kii jimmevary bharat or pakistan kii nayi sarkaron ke sar par ai
 Nobody thought that many people would go from here

 But the new governments of the two countries did not have the necessary arrangements to deal with violence and crime
 falswaroop danga fasaad hua or bahut se logon kii jane gayi or bahut se logon ko ghar chhodkar bhaagna padaa
 It is estimated that about 5 to 3 million people died during this period, some in riots and some due to travel difficulties

 In the months following Partition, there was a massive mass transfer between the two new countries
 pakistan main bahut se hinduon or sikhon ko balaat beghar kar diya gaya
 But in India Gandhiji pressurized the Congress and ensured that Muslims could stay in India if they wanted

 According to the displaced census of 1951, 72,26,000 Muslims left India after partition and went to Pakistan and 72,49,000 Hindus and Sikhs left Pakistan
 isamen se 78 pratishat sthanantaran pashchim main, mukhyatya punjab main hua
 The transfer of power to India and Pakistan in August 1947 was the first significant step by Britain towards ending colonial rule, with far-reaching consequences for its international power

 He also divided Ireland, Palestine and Cyprus

 While these divisions were not only due to religious and racial reasons, it also included the strategic and political interests of Britain, on the basis of which it made its strategy at the time of the pacts and carried out partitions

 Many writers have written novels and stories on the Partition of India and the riots that have taken place, the main of which are pinjar ko film or tamas ko prasiddh doordarshan dharawahik ke rup main roopantarit kiya gaya he

 Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which first emerged in publication in 1887
 vah british lekhak or chikitsak sar arthur conan doyal kii upaj he
 a talented "consultant detective" of London, Holmes is noted for his intellectual acumen and his clever observation, permissive reasoning and efficient use of conclusions to solve difficult cases
 conan doyal ne chaar upanyaas or chappan laghu kathaayen likhi hai jisamen homes ko chitrit kiya gaya he
 The first two stories appeared in the Beatons' Christmas Annals in 1887 and the Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890 respectively
 The character's popularity increased immensely with the introduction of the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine in 1891
 baad main 1927 tak laghu kathaon kii shrinkhalaa or do dharawahik upanyaas prakashit hue

 All four stories are narrated by Holmes' friend and biographer, Dr
 John H
 Watson, two stories narrated by Holmes himself and two others by a third person
 do kahaniyon main homes, watasan ko apni smriti se mukhya kahani sunaate hai, jabaki watasan frem kahani kaa varnan karte hai
 Conan Doyle stated that Holmes' character was inspired by Dr
 Joseph Bell, for whom Doyle worked at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary as a clerk
 homes kii tarah, bel chote-chote nirikshanon se bade nishkarsh nikaalane ke liye jane jate the
 Michael Harrison has argued in a 1971 article Ellery Queens Mystery Magazine that the character was inspired by Wendell Scherr, a "consulting detective" in a murder case that allegedly overshadowed newspaper headlines in England in 1882 
 dow watasan dwaara darj saahasik karnaamon ke baahar sherl homes kii jeevani ke bare main spasht jaankaree bahut kam he or conan doyal kii mul kahaniyon main bhi nahin he; phir bhi, uske praarambhik jivan kii praasangik jaankaree or vistrut parivaar se is jasoos ke jivan kaa ek kaakaa taiyaar hota he
 Holmes's birth in the story His Last Bow is estimated around 1854; Generally, the date is quoted as 6 January
 homes kahata he ki jab vah snaatak-purv kaksha main tha, tab usne pehali baar anumiti vidhi viksit kii

 Her initial cases, which she carried out as an amateur, came through fellow students at her university
 homes ke anusaar, apane ek sahpaathee ke pita se mulaaqaat ne use jasusi ko ek peshey ke rup main lene ke liye prerit kiya or usne vishvavidhyalay kaary ke baad chah saal ek paraamarsh jasoos ke rup main bitaye, jab tak ki vittiya kathinaaiyon ne use watasan ko apane kamare ke sangi ke rup main lene ke liye vivash na kar diya, jis bindu par kahaniyon kaa varnan shuru hota he
 Since 1881, the description is that 221B Baker Street, London, was the home of Holmes from where he runs his own private detective agency
 221B satraa kadam upar ek flats he jise ek puraani pandulipi main sadak kaa "upree chor" kaha gaya he
 By the time Dr
 Watson arrived, Holmes worked alone, rarely employing agents from a small section of the city, with a large number of informants and a group of market children whom he called the Baker Street Irregulars
 irregulars teen kahaniyon main dikhaai dete hai, "da sin of da four", "a study in skarlet" or "da adventure of da crucked main"
 Holmes's family is rarely described
 kahaniyon main uske mata-pita kii charchaa nahin he or vah keval itnaa kahata he ki uske purvaj "gramin sardaar" the
 In "the Adventure of the Greek Interpreter", Holmes claims that his great-uncle was the French artist Vernet
 uskaa ek bada bhai he, microft, ek sarkari adhikari, jo teen kahaniyon main prakat hota he; kai anya kahaniyon main uskaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 Mycroft has a unique position in the administrative service as an on-the-go database of all aspects of memory or government policies
 bataaya gaya he ki avlokan or anumiti ke maamle main microft kii kshamta sherl se kahin zyaada he
 However, he lacks the energy and passion of Sherlock and loves to spend his leisurely time at the Diogenes Club, which has been called "a club of London's most non-sociable people"
 homes ke anya bhai-bahan hai yaa nahin yah spasht nahin he
 In "the Adventure of the Copper Beaches", Holmes says, "I confess that this is not the situation in which i would like to see my sister", which makes some people anticipate her existence
 lekin aisa vah ek maamle main ek mahila ko, apni bahan jaisi maan kar chetavanee dene ke liye kahata he, isliye yah keval ek alankarik bhashaa ho sakati he
 Holmes shares most of his business time with his good friend and chronological recorder, Watson, who lived with Holmes briefly before his marriage in 1887 and again after his wife's death; Her house, her landlady, is maintained by Mrs
 Hudson
 homes ke jivan main watasan kii do bhoomikaayen hai
 First, he gives practical help in conducting his affairs; He is the right-hand man of the detective, who works in various forms of investigator, bluffer, associate and messenger
 duusari, vah homes kaa itihaaskaar he 
 homes kii zyaadaatar kahaniyaan ghatnatmak kathan hai, jo jasoos ke sarvaadhik dilachasp maamalon ke saransh ke rup main watasan ke drushtikon se likhi gai hai
 Holmes has often been referred to Watson's writings as sensational and populist, suggesting that the articles do not present unbiased and accurate reports of pure calculative "science" of his art
 phir bhi, watasan ke saath homes kii dosti nihsandeh uskaa sabase mahatvapurn rishta he
 In many stories, Holmes' affection for Watson â often hidden behind his cold, intellectual outward appearance â is exposed
 "da adventure of da thri garidebs main, ek khalanaayak ke saath takaraav main watasan ghayal ho jaataa he; haalanki goli kaa ghaav "bahut satahi" siddh hota he, watasan homes kii pratikriya se aahlaadit ho jaataa he: In total, Holmes has been described as working actively for twenty-three years, during which Watson wrote seventeen of his cases
 homes 1903-04 main ritair hokar sasex douns ke ek madhumakhi farm main chalaa jaataa he jahaan vah madhumakhi paalan ke shauk ko apane praathmik vyavsaay ke rup main letaa he or antat "practical hand book of bi culture, wyeth sam obsarveshns apon da segrigeshan of da queen" pesh karata he
 Only one case, described by Holmes himself and which he was investigating as an amateur, occurs during the detective's retirement
 homes ne aadaton or jivan-style ke maamle main khud ko "fakkad" ke rup main varnit kiya he
 According to Watson, Holmes is an eccentric who has no connection with contemporary standards of cleanliness or orderliness
 ek praarambhik kahani main, watasan, homes kaa is prakaar varnan karata he: What others find to be chaos is what Holmes sees as a repository of useful information
 kahaniyon main homes, betaratib kaagazaat or kalakritiyon ke apane bikhare jaal main dubkee laga kar bilkul vishisht dastauez yaa anya koi vastu jisaki use talash he, khoj nikaalata he
 In terms of personal hygiene, by contrast, Holmes is described in "the Hound of the Baskervilles" as a "cat-like" lover of personal cleanliness
 kisi bhi rup main yah uske peshey ke nitant vyaavhaarik anugaman main baadha utpann karata hua prathit nahin hota, tathaapi; homes kii pehali kahani,"a study in skarlet" main uske haath acid ke daag se gande ho gaye hai, jabaki baad main homes apane hi khun kii buundon kaa upyog rasinic prayog ke liye karata he
 Watson often marks Holmes's uncertain eating habits
 gahan bauddhik gatividhi ke samay jasoos dwaara aksar khud ko bhookha rakhane kaa varnan he, jaisaa ki da adventure of da norwood builder" ke dauraan, jahaan watasan ke anusaar: Holmes's historian does not mind his habit of using pipes, or his relatively little use of cigarettes and cigars
 Nor does Watson condemn Holmes's readiness to turn a truth or break a law where he believes Is that it is morally justified
 homes ko ek deshbhakt ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya he, jo kai kahaniyon main rashtriya suraksha ke maamalon main sarkaar kii taraf se kaam kar rahaa he
 He also serves as a counter-intelligence in His Last Bow which is located at the beginning of WWI
 shooting abhyaas ke rup main, jasoos ne apane baker street thikaane kii diwaar ko apni pistaul kii goliyon se banaae "VR" ke nishaan se sajaayaa he
 Holmes's pride sometimes takes the form of pride; Although with justification; He enjoys pleasing police inspectors with his excellent conclusions
 use prasiddhi kii ichha nahin he or vah aam taur par apane kaary ke liye police ko saarvajanik rup se shrey lene kii anumati dekar santusht rahata he
 It is often that when Watson publishes his stories, Holmes's role in the case becomes clear
 homes ke aacharan ko tatasth or thanda prastut kiya gaya he
 Yet in the midst of an adventure, with remarkable passion, Holmes can show the sparkle
 uski pravriti main pradarshnakarita he or ek apradhi ko pakadaney or uski kalai kholane ke liye vah vyapak jaal taiyaar karata he, aksar watasan yaa scotland yard nirikshakon main se ek ko prabhavit karne ke liye
 Holmes occasionally uses drugs, especially when there is a shortage of excitatory cases
 vah cocaine kaa aadi he, jise ek saat pratishat ke ghol main ek vishesh sui ke prayog se jise vah ek chamade ke khol main rakhata he, chubhota he
 Holmes also uses opium occasionally, but expresses his disapproval when he visits an opium base
 19veen sadi ke uttarardh main sabhi teen, england main jaays the
 By showing no medical objection to Holmes' drug use, Dr
 Watson depicts the Victorian medical fanatic
 naitik rup se, vah apane dost kii aadat kii, ise jasoos kii "ekmaatr buraai" bataate hue ninda karte hai or homes ke maansik swasthya or utkrisht buddhi par iske sambhavit asar ko lekar chintaa vyakt karte hai
 In later narratives, Watson claims to have removed Holmes from drugs
 phir bhi, uske chikitsak mitra ke anusaar, homes ek nashedi bana rahata he jisaki aadat "mari nahin, balkee keval so rahi thi
 " haalanki shuru main use 221B baker street main apane aaramdaayak nivas ke kiraye ko saajha karne ke liye watasan kii jarurat rahati he, "da adventure of da daaing detective" main watasan khulaasa karte hai, jab homes akelaa rahata tha tab "mujhe koi andeh nahin he ki ghar ko shaayad us keemat par kharida gaya hoga jo homes apane kamare ke liye bhugtan karata he," yah ingit karte hue ki usne apane vyavhaar se ek acchhee aay utpann kii, haalanki yah thik se kabhi nahin pataa chalaa ki vah apni sevaaon ke liye kitna shulk letaa he
 He says in "the Problem of Thor Bridge" that "my professional fee is at a certain level
 main unhen badalata nahin hum, sirf jab main unhen puri tarah maaf kar detaa hum 


 " This is stated in a context when a customer offered him twice his fee; However, it is possible that wealthy clients provide Holmes with much higher remuneration than his standard fee: In "the Adventure of the Final Problem", Holmes states that the government of France and the royal residence of Scandinavia gave him sufficient money for his services
 So that he can retire comfortably, while Watson in "the Adventure of Black Peter" indicates that Holmes refuses to help the rich and powerful He would have paid taxes if he did not like their case, whereas he devoted a whole week's time to the affairs of highly polite customers
 "a cese of aaidentity" main homes, watasan ko yah bhi bataata he ki "a scandle in bohemia" ke baad, bohemia ke raja ne use ek sunaharaa sunghni dibba diya or dach shahi parivaar se use ek shandaar anguthi mili; "da adventure of da bruce- partington plance" main homes ko ek panna nirmit taai-pin maharani victoria se praapt hota he
 Other mementoes of Holmes' cases are a gold guinea from Irene Adler and a signed thank-you letter from the President of France and the Legion of Honor The Adventure of the Golden pins-nez "the Adventure of the" for capturing an assassin named Huert "holmes rubs his hands with glee" at the Primary School when the Duke of Holderness writes to Zodiac, which also surprises Watson and then Che
 The pats, saying that "I am a poor man," an event that could be dismissed as a tendency toward ironic humor that Holmes
 nishchit rup se, apane karier ke dauraan homes ne sabase shaktishaalee raajaaon or europe kii sarkaron or vibhinn amir kulinon or udyogpatiyon donon ke liye kaam kiya or garib sahukaaron or samaaj ke nichle paaydaan kii vinamr adhyapikaon dwaara salaah ke liye bhi usase sampark kiya gaya
 Holmes, for his expenses, charges money from customers and can claim any reward offered to solve the problem: he says in "the Adventure of the Speckled Band" that Miss Stoner could pay the expenses she incurred
 And requests that "the red-headed League" bank compensate for the expenses incurred on the case
 "holmes has his wealthy banker client to pay the costs incurred in retrieving the stolen gems in The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet, and he also claims the reward that banker announced for the finder Was
 homes ko prabhavit karne vaali ekmaatr mahila thi ireni edler, jo homes dwaara hameshaa "vah aurat" ke rup main sambodhit kii gai
 Holmes himself is not quoted using the term directly â even though he takes his real name several times in other cases
 edler un chand mahilaon main se ek he jo homes kii tamaam kahaniyon main uddhrut kii gayi hai, haalanki vah vastav main keval ek hi kahani, "a scandle in bohemia" main vyaktigat rup se upasthit hoti he
 In one story, "the Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton" becomes Holmes' match for the wedding, but only with the desire to gather information for his case
 He shows a clear interest in the way a lot of attractive female clients get in the way
 ,
 Holmes essentially "showed no further interest in her client when she moved out of the center of one of her problems
" " homes ne unke yauvan, saundarya or urja ko kisi bhi romani hit se alag, anupranit karne vaala paaya
 Such episodes reflect Holmes' fascination, yet there is no sign of any serious or long-term attachment, except in the case of Adler
 watasan ne likhaa he ki homes ko "mahilaon se ghrinaa" he lekin " saath anugrah paane kaa ek vicitra tarika he" homes kahata he,"main stri jati kaa purna man se prashansak nahin hum"; vastav main vah paata he "mahilaon kii manshaa

 " mahilaon ke saath homes ke sambandh kaa ek or dilachasp pahalu yah he ki unki sangat se use jo anand praapt hota he uskaa strot unke dwaara laai gai samasyaayein hai
 In Sign of the Four, Watson cites Holmes as "a human being, a calculating machine," and Holmes is quoted as saying, "it is most important, to make his decisions by personal qualities Should not be allowed to be prejudiced
 a client is just one unit for me - a factor in the problem
 Emotional qualities are opposed to clear logic
 main aapako vishwaas dilaataa hum ki aaj tak jis aurat ko sabase aakarshak aurat maine paaya use beemaa ke paise ke liye teen chote bacchon ko jehar dene ke jurm main faansee par lataka diya gaya
 

 "it refers to Holmes' reluctance to make connections with women in general and with the client in particular, as Watson said" Sometimes you see a positive inhumanity in you
 " "da adventure of da davills foot" ke ant main homes kahata he:"maine kabhi pyaar nahin kiya watasan, par agar main karata or yadi us aurat kaa jise main pyaar karata, uskaa ant aisa hota, to shaayad main apane swechhachari sher ke shikari kii tarah vyavhaar karata

" da sin of da four main ek baar phir watasan, homes ko yah kehete hue uddhrut karata he,"main unhen bahut zyada nahin bataaungaa

" watasan likhata he ki jab ki vah unhen naapsand or un par avishvaas karata he, phir bhi vah ek "udaar virdohi" he
 Holmes's primary intellectual investigative method is the permissible logic of solving a crime "with a drop of water", he writes, "that a logical person can guess the probability of the Atlantic or Niagara without seeing one or hearing the other
" Holmes's stories often begin with a display of the courageous talent of his "permissiveness"
 yah tarkikon or tark main ruchi rakhane waalon ke liye thodaa ruchikar he ki ve vishleshan karne kaa prayaas karen ki apni anumiti ke dauraan homes kya kar rahaa he
 Homogeneous permission appears to be constructed from conclusions that are primarily based on either straightforward, plausible principles that are the result of cautious inductive studies such as Holmes's study of various types of cigar ashes or the best explanation Is the conclusion
 homes ke sidhe-sapaat vyaavhaarik siddhanton kaa swarup aam taur par,"agar 'p', to 'q', hota he jahaan 'p' drishyman saboot he or 'q' vah he jo saboot ingit karata he
 But there are intermediate principles as well, as can be seen in the following example
 "a scandle in bohemia" main homes anumiti karata he ki watasan haal hi main bahut bhigaa hua tha or uski "jo naukaraani ladki thi vah bahut hi foohad or laaparvaah thi"
jab vismit hokar watasan poochta he ki homes yah baat kaise jaanata he to homes jawaab detaa he: In this case, Holmes used several associated theories: spasht dhang se aise siddhant lagu karke homes yah anumaan lagane main sakasham he ki: "the edges of Watson's shoes are strewn with parallel erosion"; From "watson's maid is clumsy and careless"; And "watson has been very wet lately and went out in dirty weather
 " Permissive arguments enable Holmes to effectively disclose a stranger's occupation, such as a retired sergeant of the Marines in a Study in Scarlett; The former carpenter of a ship in the Red-headed League who became a Mahajan; And a billiard-marker and an artillery retired NCO in The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter
 Similarly, by studying inanimate objects, Holmes is able to draw surprisingly detailed conclusions about their owners, including Watson's pocket-watch in The Sign of the Four, as well as other stories containing a cap, a pipe, And a stick
 ek baar usne dher saare saboot jamaa kiye or sambhav vyakhyaaon kii anumiti kii or ek samaadhaan prastut karne ke liye homes us ek vyakhya kii taraf badhata he jo is maamle ke sabhi tathyon se mail khaati he
 As Holmes tells Watson, "when you have removed the impossible, whatever is left, however unlikely, must be true
" homes abhinay or chhadam vesh banane main gahari ruchi pradarshit karata he
 In many stories, he bears such a natural disguise to gather evidence that even Watson does not catch him, as in "the Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton", in The Man with the Twisted Lip and a Scandal in Bohemia
 In other exploits, Holmes pretends to be injured or sick to make his case effective, or to blame those involved, such as "the Adventure of the Dying Detect The Tiv "
 pistaul homes or watasan apane saath pistaul rakhte hai; watasan ke maamle main aksar uski puraani sarvice revolver
 However, Watson only discusses the use of these weapons on seven occasions
 ' chadi ek sajjan vyakti ke rup main homes, aksar ek lakdi yaa chadi lekar chalata he
 He is described by Watson as an expert in wooden swords and twice uses his wand as a weapon
 talwaar a study in skarlet main watasan homes ko talwarbazi main visheshgy varnit karata he-yadhyapi kisi bhi kahani main homes ne talwaar kaa prayog nahin kiya he
 It is discussed in "gloria Scott" that Holmes practiced the sword
 chaabuk kai kahaniyon main homes ek chaabuk se las dikhataa he
 He uses it in The Adventure of the Speckled Band to kill a poisonous snake and comes close to killing a thug in a Case of Identity
 "da red-heded lig" main ek "chaabuk" ke prayog se homes, jon clay ke haathon se ek pistaul gira detaa he
 Boxing Holmes is described as a formidable fighter with bare fingers
 da sin of da four main, homes apana parichay ek peshewar mukkebaaz ko is rup main detaa he: On several occasions in the stories, Holmes became embroiled in a clandestine battle with his emerging rivals, where he was essentially the winner
 In "gloria Scott" it is reiterated that Holmes is trained as a boxer
 marshall art da adventure of da empti house main homes watasan ko bataata he ki marshall art kaa istemaal karke kaise usne professor moriarti ko kaabo main kiya or apane virdohi ko rhishenbakh jalprapaat par aisa pataka ki uski mrityu ho gai
 He states that "however, i have some knowledge, of the Japanese system of baritsu, ka or wrestling, which has proved very useful to me at times
 " "baritsu" naam, vaastavik-jivan ke marshall art bartitsu ke liye ek sandarbh prathit hota he
 In the very first story a Study in Scarlet, something about Holmes's background is given
 1881 ke purvardh main, use rasayan vigyaan ke ek swatantra chaatr ke rup main pesh kiya gaya he jisaki kai vividh jigyaasu ruchiyan hai, jisamen se lagbhag sabhi ekanishtha hokar use aparaadhon ko sulajhane main behatar banane ke rup main prakat huin

homes vaigyanik tareeke kaa kadai se paalan karata he or tarkon or prekshan or anumiti kii shakti par jor detaa he
 In a Study in Scarlett, Holmes claims that he does not know that the Earth revolves around the Sun, since such information is irrelevant to his work
 pratyaksh rup se watasan se yah tathy sunne ke baad, vah kahata he ki vah turant use bhuulane kii koshish karegaa
 vah kahata he ki uskaa maananaa he ki jaankaree ko sangrahit karne ke liye mastishk kii ek simit kshamta he or isliye nirarthak baaten seekhney se uski upyogi chijen seekhney kii kshamta keval kam hi hogi
dow watasan baad main homes kii kshamta kaa akalan is prakaar karata he: Even at the end of a Study in Scarlet, it is shown that Holmes knows Latin and that there is no need for translation of the original Roman proverbs, although the direct utility of language knowledge for espionage work is doubtful
 baad kii kathaayen bhi suchi kaa khandan karti hai
 Despite the possible ignorance of Holmes's politics, in "A Scandal in Bohemia" he immediately realizes the true identity of the so-called "count von Krum"
 gaiyr-sansanikhej sahitya ke sambandh main, uskaa bhaashan bible, shakespeare, yahaan tak ki goethe ke sandarbhon se paripurna he
 In addition, in The Adventure of the bruce-partington Plans, Watson informs that in November 1895, "holmes immerses himself in a monopoly he took from the Polyteous Mottes of Lasas" - a highly esoteric field, for which Holmes Will have to unravel his memory with a vast store of information, which has nothing to do with the fight of crime - such a broad knowledge that his disobedience has to be Year is considered "final word" on
 baad kii kathaayen is dharna kaa khandan karatin hai ki homes tab tak kuch jaanane kaa icchhuk nahin he jab tak ki vah uske vyavsaay ke liye avilamb praasangik naa ho; da vaili of fier ke duusare adhyay main, homes to balki ghoshnaa kar detaa he ki "sabhi gyaan jasoos ke liye upyogi hota he" or da adventure of da loyns main ke ant main vah apane aap ko "vicitra dharnashakti vaali smriti kaa ek sarv-vishay pathak" ke rup main paribhaashit karata he
 " homes ek sakasham kuta visheshgy bhi he
 He addresses Watson, "I am quite familiar with all forms of code writing, and i am the author of a trivial discourse on the subject, in which i am analyzing a hundred and sixty different words
" One such scheme is solved in The Adventure of the Dancing Men using frequency analysis
 bhautik saboot kaa homes kaa vishleshan vaigyanik or sateek, donon he
 His methods include the use of latent prints such as footprints and hoof prints and cycle tracks to identify action at a crime scene, the use of tobacco ashes and cigarette turrets to identify criminals, a fraud bust
 To compare type letters, use gunpowder residue to expose two murderers ", compare bullets obtained from two crime sites and Even the earliest use of fingerprints
 In a Scandal in Bohemia, Holmes also demonstrates his knowledge of psychology, where he lures Irene Adler into cheating him about the picture hiding, which rests on this "premise
" That an unmarried woman would want her most precious thing in the event of a fire while a married woman would pounce on her child
 In the first story, a Study in Scarlet, apane jivan kii uttejnaa ke baavjood homes sevanivrutt hokar madhumakhi paalan karne sasex downs chale jate hai or is vishay par ek pustak likhte hai,"practical hand book of bi culture, wyeth sam obsarveshns apon da segrigeshan of da queen

 Although Sherlock Holmes is not the original novel Detective, his name has become a quote
 uski kahaniyon main kai jasusi kahani alankaar shaamil hai jaise, vafaadaar lekin kam budhimaan sahaayak, ek bhoomika jiske liye dow watasan adarsh ban gaya he
 Sherlock Holmes has sometimes been used in scientific literature
 redford uski prabuddhata par vichaar karte hai
 Using Conan Doyle's stories as data, Redford estimates Sherlock Holmes' IQ in three different ways and concludes that his intelligence is indeed very high
 snidar 19veen sadi ke madhya or uttarardh ke vigyaan or aparaadhashastra ke prakaash main homes ke tareekon kii jaanch karte hai

 They throw light on aspects of Doyle's books that are currently favorable about expertise, aspects that are inconceivable and aspects that suggest further research
 conan doyal dwaara likhit chappan laghu kathaayen or chaar upanyaas homian dwaara kanoon kahi gai hai
 Early scholars of this law include Ronald Knox of Britain and Christopher Morley of New York
 shradhanjali swaroop, kam athwa adhik maatra main lekhakon ne sherl homes, conan doyal, yaa kahaniyon ke paatro se kai pop samskruti sandarbh nirmit kiye hai
 Such cues serve to develop a plot, increase the intellectual level of the part or treat it as an Easter egg for an observant audience
 kuch to mukhar rahe hai jinhone homes ko ek naveen setting main ek charitra ke rup main prastut kiya, yaa thodaa adhik sookshm sanket, jaise kii ek apartment sankhya 221B main rahete hue ek taarkik charitra kaa nirmaan

 The simplest reference is often to give anyone who does any kind of espionage work, wearing a hunting hat and cloak
 Another rich area in terms of pop culture is the ancestry and descendants of Holmes, but really the writer's imagination is the only limit

 Holmes's fan period from 1891 to 1894 â the time between Holmes's disappearance and possible death in The Adventure of the Final Problem and then the reappearance in "the Adventure of the Adventure of the Empty Houseâ" "as mentioned
 haalanki yah ullekhneey he, ki baad main ek kahani ke 1892 main ghatit hone kaa varnan he
 Conan Doyle wrote the first set of stories over the course of a decade
 Desiring to devote more time to his historical novels, he killed Holmes in "the Final Problem", published in 1893
 Facing eight years of public pressure After doing so, the author wrote The Hound of the Baskervilles, published in 1901, vaguely establishing it before Holmes' "death"
 Although the public was pleased with the story, she was not satisfied with a posthumous Holmes and so Conan Doyle revived Holmes after two years

 Some authors have given other explanations for the interval

" In his memoirs Conan Doyle quotes a reader who declared the earlier stories to be superior to the latter, for the reason that Holmes may have been killed when he went to the Raishenbach falls, rather than ever before
 Not the same
 Holmes's differences between pre and post-interval rather actually led to speculation among those who played "the Great Game"
 In more fictional theories, Mark Bourne's story "the Case of the Detectives Smile" was published in the poetry compilation Sherlock Holmes in Orbit, which estimates that one of the places Holmes visited during his hiatus was Alice's Wonderland
 While living there, he solved a case of stolen samosas and his experiences there contributed to the extermination of his cocaine addiction

 Such as Andorra, Inland - Finland, Monaco, Svalbard - Norway, Kosovo - Serbia, Vatican City, Palestinian Territory and Hong Kong which is the exclusive administrative region in China, and many others
 Andorra could until 1993 be considered de facto to have been under dual French and Spanish rule due to the lack of clear division of powers while it was ruled by a Spanish bishop and the French president, according to a treaty
 In 1278, the conflict between the French Count and the Catalan bishop was resolved by the signing of a pareage, which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the Count of Foix and the Bishop of La Seu d'urgell 
 The pareage, a feudal institution recognizing the principle of equality of rights shared by two rulers, gave the small state its territory and political form
today Andorra is a co-principality with the President of France and the Bishop of Urgell, Spain as co-princes, in a duumvirate
 The Treaty of Kiel in 1814 terminated the danish-norwegian union
 Norway came under the rule of the King of Sweden, but the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland remained as possessions of Denmark
 Until the 1911 constitution, the princes of Monaco were absolute rulers
 In July 1918, a treaty was signed providing for limited French protection over Monaco
 The treaty, part of the Treaty of Versailles, established that Monegasque international policy would be aligned with French political, military, and economic interests
 France has in many ways still control over the state
the executive branch consists of a Minister of State, who presides over a four-member Council of Government 
 The minister of state is a French citizen appointed by the prince from among candidates proposed by the French government
in 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco clarified that if there are no heirs to carry on the dynasty, the principality will remain an independent nation rather than revert to France
 Monaco's military defence, however, is still the responsibility of France
 The Vatican City state came into existence by virtue of the Lateran Treaty in 1929, which spoke of it as a new creation, and not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States that had previously encompassed central Italy
 Of which, most were absorbed into the Kingdom of Italy in 1860, and the city of Rome with a small area close to it, ten years later in 1870
 The state has no firm population as its citizens are only granted citizenship for the duration of service in the state
 Those without dual citizenship will then get Italian citizenship

 kharvel jain dharm kaa anuyaayi tha or sambhavtah uske samay main kaling kii bahusankhyak janata bhi vardhaman mahavir ke dharm ko apana chuki thi
 According to the inscription of Hathigumpha, the first fifteen years of Kharavela's life were spent in the study of learning
 is kaal main usne dharm, arth, shashan, mudrapaddati, kaanoon, shastrasanchalan aadi kii shiksha praapt kii

 magadh ke jis raja ko kharvel ne apane charnon par girane ke liye vivash kiya tha, anek itihaaskaaron ke anusaar uskaa naam bahestimit tha
 He has also tried to read the name of this king in the Hathigumpha inscription
 par sab vidwaan is paath se sahamat nahin hai
 Mr
 Jaiswal, assuming the name of the king of Magadha as mentioned in the Hathigumpha inscription, is arguably synonymous with Pushyamitra Sunga and it is believed that Kalingaraja Kharavel attacked and defeated Sungavanshi Pushyamitra
 par anek aitihaasik hathigumpha main aaye naam ko na bahestimit sweekaar karne ko udyat hai or na hi pushyamitra ke saath milaane ko
 But there is no doubt that according to the Hathigumpha inscription, Kharavela had also conquered Magadha by invading Uttarapath and forced the king there to bow before him

 hindi kii praarambhik patrikaon main "saraswati" ke saath hi "maadhuri" kii gananaa hoti he
 Amritlal Nagar has also written in my favorite stories that his first story was printed in Madhuri in 1934
 Aukat mean Pluto to organize the influence of the planet, mobilize, form cooperatives, do good work, radio, television, nuclear power, radio operator, social worker, X-ray work in medical field, body by machines To investigate, work as a nuclear security expert, perform pipe fitting work, analyze planet origins, work as policemen, Great reformer, television mechanic, radar mechanic, searching for machines, spying, working together, feeding and handling a large group, giving the right path to confused people who work on power Not visible, knowing those secrets, identifying magnetic power, knowledge of radio frequency and organic coiling, radio tuning and Received, the work of handling large projects, vartmaan main mobile companiyaan, satellite companiyaan, or bady companiyon ke rup main bharat kii tri jaisi companiyaan pluto ke kaaran hi fal phul rahi hai
 The effect of Pluto is personally found in the brain to collect those sensations and to use them when needed, which has never been seen, but felt, the way electric energy flows in an electric wire
 , But it can be used, but cannot be seen, water can be seen in the chemical, but sweet or salty secret hidden inside the water
 Quoti cannot be seen, can be felt
 pluto se shaktivaan vyakti bhautikta main usee prakaar se hota he, jaise ek bijli kaa transfaramar, bady shakti ke rup main vah gyaarah hajaar volt kii vidyut shakti apane andar samahit karata he, or jarurat ke mutabik aage bhi detaa he lekin jamaa karte vakt or dete vakt vah garm jarur hota he, usee prakaar se pluto se shaktivaan vyakti apni saadhnaaon se apni shikshaaon se apane maansik or shaareerik prayogon se apane yogabal se apane tapabal se shaktiyon ko apane main ekatrit karata he or unka prayog jarurat ke vakt karata he lekin is jamaa karne or dene ke vakt uske andar jo taap utpann hota he, vahi vyakti kaa ahankaar yaa igo kehalaata he
 Similarly, when a person accumulates the power inside him, which is necessary for a very large group, such as knowledge of a teacher, research of a scientist, etc
 pluto vyakti ke andar un shaktiyon ko bhi detaa he jinke dwaara vah aage kii santati ko utpann karata he, pluto kii shreshthatam mahatta athmiya shaktiyon ko praapt kar lenaa, sabase kharaab mahatta oonche vichaaron or shaktiyon ko neeche giraanaa, jaise ek sadhak apni shaktiyon ko pehle to jamaa kar letaa he, lekin moh yaa lobh ke vasheebhoot hokar logon ko galat raay dekar yaa parashakti ko dhan ke rup main taulne par us shreshth shakti ko giraane kii koshish karata he, or kuch hi dinon ke andar kanoon yaa kisi sirafire vyakti ke dwaara badnaam kar diya jaataa he, arthath oonchi friquency ko neeche giraane kaa kaam karnaa, or pluto kii mahaan vichaar shrankhla vaala jataka intaraashtriya paalan poshan kii bhaavana rakhata he
 Pluto of the first house gives great wishes to the person, gives bravery, keeps himself weighty in the environment around him, and keeps himself with will power, any wrong feeling enters the mind As soon as the electric shock breaks, the reason for handling others becomes a will of life, it is difficult to experience others only after experiencing them
 The idea is to create ideas from thought and edit other thoughts, to feel a magnetic force inside you that you call yourself to others by yourself, having difficulty understanding by other people that this problem What is it, to consider yourself alone all the time, to have gentleness inside you, to have the power to understand within yourself, as well as to constantly fight within yourself for what is Believe it or not, apane andar ek bhayankar krodh ko paanaa jab kisi anuchit baat kaa anuchit tareeke se prayog kiya jaay, jaise bijli ke galat prayog ke dwaara yaa short circuit ke dwaara haal hota he, yaa galat tareeke se prayog karne se saamne vaala koi bhi kyon na ho yaa to samaapt kar dena yaa, khud samaapt ho janaa, athwa kamjor sthiti kii pojisan main usee tarah se fuj ho janaa jis prakaar se ek bomb yaa bijli kaa main switch, para shaktiyon ko parakhane kii shakti rakhana, maansik rup se dono ankhon ke bich main bina kuch soche dhyaan rakhane par ajeeb se hai sparking jaise prakaash ko dekhnaa, parashaktiyon se sambandh sthapit karnaa, or man chaahi jaankaree lenaa, dhyaan samadhi ke dwaara radio friquency kii tarah se dur kii chizon kaa anubhav karnaa, kshamaa kar dena or bhul janaa, adhikta se kaaran ke upar vichaar nahin karnaa, chaahe vah vasvik kaaran ho yaa chitrit kiya gaya ho, har vastu ko shaktivaan karne kii koshish karnaa chaahe vah mitti kaa dhela hi kyon na ho, samay aane par jab khud ke dwaara kisi kaa man aahat hota ho to apane ko halkaa sa lacheela bana lenaa, aadi pluto ke pehle ghar main hone par prabhaav dekhe jate he
 When Pluto is in the second house, the person has bitter experience in terms of money, whatever mental decisions he makes, they are completely risky
 jis prakaar se ek bijli kaa ejeeniyar dhan kamaane ke liye bijli main haath to daalata he, lekin uske paas do hi maarg hote hai, yaa to bijli ke upkaran yaa bijli kii line ko thik karne ke baad moti rakam praapt kar lenaa yaa fir jokhim uthaakar apane sharir kii kshati uthaa lenaa, is bhav kaa pluto dhairya ke saath kaam karne kii salaah detaa he, apane andar shakti rakhane kii salaah detaa he, un shaktiyon ke andar gyaan kii shakti, jo purna shiksha kii taraf ishaara karti hai, is bhav kaa pluto maansik, shaareerik or bhautikta main jo bekaar kii shaktiyaan punap rahi hoti he, unako samaapt karne kii himmat detaa he, saath hi atyaadhik dhani banane, apane ko sabhrant tareeke se jeene, aadhuniktaa kii chaah rakhane, kaa maanas bhi duusare bhav kaa pluto detaa he
 a person also sees the imprecise reason of money coming and going in his life, he never cares about how much has come and how much has gone, because there is no raw material in the production of ideas, the closure of a path
 Already, the second way is prepared on the psyche of the person, just as Graham Bell had the mindset of building a telephone before the work of the old-fashioned runner was stopped
 Was, and before the telephones had gone, the way of the mobile was made, Pluto of the second sense with which it is connected, leave the front but it does not leave, just as the electric socket assumes, the plug Even if it is removed, but the Sakit will remain there, a person with second-rate Pluto should use his prosperity in conjunction with others, otherwise people will leave him alone
 Let's jis tareeke se bijli main athaah shakti to hoti he, lekin vah apane dwaara apane ko sambhaal nahin sakati he, use sanbhaalane ke liye dusron kii hi jarurat padati he
 The person with the third Pluto can have an unstable, mind-boggling heart, saying everything in a static form, or eating a presenter after presenting evidence of everything for a physical reason
 jo bhi log or ghatnayen vyakti ke jivan main aati he, unako sahi rup main bakhaan karnaa, jo bhi kaaran or saamne vaale kii tasviir hoti he, use guide kii tarah se bakhaan karnaa bhi mukhya mana ja saktaa he
 Due to the effect presented in the person, he is able to understand every man's talk and work, just as an engineer understands the machine only after knowing about it, similarly the third Pluto person will understand the reason
 He only discusses it
 vyakti kii isi kaaran se jigyaasa itani batch jaati he ki vah har kshetra main apni aadat ke anusaar jaankaree or vidya ko siikhnaa chahta he, or jo bhi dekhtaa he yaa sikhta he, use hi hoobahoo bakhaan karne ke koshish karata he
 It is a habit of a person to do research on a subject, to make figures after research, to do the work of solving puzzles, to be very attracted towards brain games
 jis kaam main jasusi jaisi bate hotin hai unako kehane or karne main aksar is prakaar ke log apane ko maahir bana lete he, or khel bhi jasusi ke khelte he
 This type of person keeps searching for something, so that he finds something for his life, searching for means of life, and also tries to find the area in which his life can start again, Or any new element can be included in the thought
 jhallahat or dimagi rup se bhanabhanane kii aadat tab or us vyakti ke andar paidaa ho jaati he jab jis baat ko khojane ke baad yaa khojate samay athwa kisi kaam ko karte vakt koi rukaawat uske saamne aa jaati he
 That person should forget all this at that time, he needs to use himself to write something well, write something so that people can understand his language and work, as soon as he does this work, his mind is less tense or fretful
 It will be done
 And what will be written will be used to clean the thoughts of that person out of the dirt, and when someone tries to write something, some new ideas will definitely come out in that writing
 Is, and once if the thoughts and attitudes that were already in place have changed in some way, or have been hidden for some reason, then you will end them forever, as if that idea and reason has been given forever, Just as a file is hidden in a computer, and cannot be found after searching, due to the fret the person talks about creating another program or file after delating it
 is bhav kaa pluto apane ko sabake saamne dikhaane ke andar ek nambar kaa kaam karata he, apni chhavi ko yaa tasviir ko bahut hi umdaa tareeke se pesh karata he, vyakti ke andar antar gyaan kii bahut adhik maatra hoti he, or vah apane antargyaan ke dwaara prayek vastu ko jaanane kii himmat rakhata he, or is prakaar kaa vyakti hameshaa gharelu vaataavarna main nivas karnaa pasand karata he, us vyakti ke paas jo shakti hoti he, us antargyaan vaali shakti ke kaaran use apane aasapaas vaale logon se kaafii ladai kerani padati he, jaise us vyakti kii ichha apane ghar main patalun pahinaney kii hoti he, or us ghar main dhoti pahini jaati he, to uski vah ichha uske liye apane hi ghar main pareshaani kaa kaaran ban jaati he
 Just as the daughters of old thought people of the village come into the homes, and they start wearing jeans and pants, leaving the cloak of the saree or rural environment, then those jeans and pants cause trouble for them and even while being in trouble, The spirit of it presents to them
 vyakti ke mata pita yaa uske saas sasur kaa dakhal yaa to uske liye bahut badhia rahata he, yaa fir uski shaareerik yaa maansik beemaari kaa kaaran ban jaataa he
 Pluto of this price can be matched with an electric oil filled transformer, if it is filled with oil according to time and weather and the amount of electricity that is coming and used in less quantity, then the oil is not hot
 , And if somehow the oil is adulterated, or the supply is reduced then the experiment is increased, then the transformer will be heated or boil the oil out and c It will end by being silent, or it will gradually eliminate itself like a TB disease
 paidaa karne vaale mata pita bhi is kaaran ko paidaa kar sakate he, or jivan saathi ke mata pita bhi is prakaar kaa vyavhaar kar sakate he, paidaa karne vaale mata pita to transfaramar main aane vaali bijli kii supplai kii tarah se hote he, or sasuraal vaale mata pita transfaramar se lee jane vaali supplai kii tarah se hote hai
 The people of Pluto of this house always work continuously at their place of birth, whether it is in the form of studies or from childhood, they should be entrusted with the work of responsibilities
 And may be a region to flourish
 paanchaven bhav ke pluto ke dwaara jataka ke andar bina kaam aane vaali aadaten or yogyatayen hoti he, mahaan kaaryakshmata or apane khud ke dwaara bakhaanne kii aadat adhik tar is prakaar ke jaatakon main paayi jaati he, bachche ek mashin kii bhaanti ban jate he, jis prakaar se vyakti apane bachche ko ek batan kii bhaanti bana letaa he, uske kehete hi kaam hona chaiye, use bachche kii maansikta se koi lenaa dena nahin hota he, vah to keval use prayog karnaa jaanata he
 a person who has a mechanic idea does not understand his children, and children do not understand the native, in his eyes, the same studies are useful for those who can show their influence in an interview, but those things do not matter to him
 It is that which itself is surrounded by things that someone has made towards her, as the mother's mother thought, she also considers her family like a machine, and that too the price In addition to the love of her family, she considers her intelligence to measure by material wealth
 is bhav ke pluto vaale jataka sambhog ko adhik prayog karne ke chakkar main kitne hi kritrim upayon kaa prayog karte he, ve apni kaam shakti ko badhaane ke liye vibhinn tareekon kaa prayog karte he, jinke andar kamottejak drashya, kamottejak awaajen, ashleel filmein, ashleel gane, aadhi mukhya hote hai, aage chal kar yahi aadaten unke sharir ko rogon se ladne main asamarth kar detii he, or jataka ek mashin ke andar hi apni jivan lila ko samaapt kar letaa he
 a person with this sense of Pluto has the ability to transmit to the place of work and within the work, such a person has a feeling, that he should always be involved in the prestige of the work place, whatever he does, he Everyone's eyesight, there is a feeling inside the person that whoever works under him can work according to the way he wants, whether he works in the work place Whether it is formed or the constituted society of his own family, there is a feeling in the person that he should not let anything bother him and also make him work according to his own
 vyakti ke andar kaafii lambe samay tak kaary karne kii bhaavana hoti he, vah bina kisi rukaawat ke saadhaaran aadmi se adhik kaam kar saktaa he, vyakti ke andar kathinaaiyon se ladne kii prabal bhaavana hoti he, or vah un kaamon ko karnaa pasamd karata he jo ki duusare nahin kar pate hai, yaa fir jo kiye jane vaale ko karne main ghabadate he, jasusi or khojbin karne main majaa aata he, saath jo gahari kathinaayee main duube hue log hote hai, unase baat karne or us gahari kathinaayee ko dur karne ke upapay khojane ke liye lambe samay tak kaam karne kii bhaavana hoti he, un kathinaaiyon ko ek vyora bana kar or tareeke se dur karne main unako bahut anand aata he, samadhi lagaana or meditesan ke prati acha lagaav hota he, atmaaon se sampark kaa khud saadhan ban jate hai, or jo kaam kathin hote hai unako apane saath kaam karne waalon ke sanidh main bhi chup chaap kaam karte rahete he, infekson kii bimaariyaan jaldi gher leti he, adhik baithak ke kaaran pet ke pachan tantra par bura asar padataa he
 To control and get the right to feel with force, to understand their inheritance towards these things is found in such kind of natives, they are able to give their life partner and partner work to work completely according to themselves and You want to force yourself to join yes, they do not fully know the art of working in collaboration, by those who are partners and partners Su is chosen, he should walk according to his opinion, this is the reason why there is a shortage for his life partner to ever walk evenly, Pluto is considered to be the planet of lightning, the switch to use electricity It is used, the native of Pluto in the seventh house considers his life partner and common friend as the switch of power, they turn it off whenever they want and whenever they want, the life partner also gives his power Process is used in the same way, usee prakaar se jab saatven bhav ke pluto vaala jataka jab lagaataar apni hi chalaane ke liye saamne vaale ko majaboor kar detaa he, to jivan saathi yaa saajhedaar yaa to kuch samay ke liye chup hokar apana sab kuch band karke baith jaataa he, yaa fir is prakaar ke vyakti ko apni kamajori or shakti ke pradarshan ke kaaran pareshaan kar detaa he
 This type of person has a habit of generating power in others, they suddenly know the art of generating good or bad power in others, they can also give praise to the front for generating these powers
 And can even provoke him so badly by abusing him that he will take off to die, that is why he either becomes very famous in the society, or is infamous again
 Let's go
 is bhav ke pluto vaala vyakti ek bahut hi vyavsaayik sulajhaa hua dimag rakhata he
 The brain has an amazing power to analyze
 parashaktiyon ke prabhaav ke kaaran is prakaar kaa vyakti raakh se sona nikaalane kii himmat rakhata he, jo bhi is prakaar ke vyakti ke saamne hota he, uske prati jaraa si der main is tarah kaa vyakti uskaa bhootkaal vartmaan kaal or bhavishya ke prati kathan karne kii himmat rakhata he, jyotish, hast rekha, dev sadhana, puja paath aadi ke dwaara lagaataar shaktiyon ko jaagrit karne kii adbhut kshamta hoti he, vyakti ke dwaara bhoot pret or adrshay shaktiyon ke prati rujhaan se aas paas ke log use galat najar se dekhne lagate he, or jis prakaar se bijli ke taar ko chune se log darate he, usee prakaar se is prakaar ke vyakti se log darane lagate he, jivan saathi or saajhedaar ke dwaara bhautik padaarthon or ghar main yaa apane kaary sthaan main svachlit sadhano ke prati adhik kharch karne se pareshaania paidaa ho jaati he
 Lack of accumulated funds and difficulty in saving through bank etc
 are also seen in such kind of natives, such natives keep searching for the meaning of life, and what happens after death, their cause and action of redress Most of the time they waste their time in understanding, what they get, they are not able to show it directly to others in any way and people consider them foolish, their Igyasa that the universe affects the lives of people with type
 is pravriti ke kaaran ve apane andar ke bare main adhik jaan jate hai, apni suraksha ke prai is prakaar kaa jataka kaafii samvedansheel ho jaataa he
 This type of person is aware of how positive effects are given to people, so those who know such a person, they can benefit from it
 adhiktar maamalon main is prakaar ke jataka apni kameksha kii adhikta ke kaaran kamottejnaa ke samay kritrim sadhano kaa prayog karte he, or apane andar kii takat ko samaapt kar lete he, jisase hone vaali santan yaa to kaamyaab nahin hoti yaa fir apane liye takat jutaney or apane ko samaajik taur par ooncha dikhaane ke liye galat sadhano kaa prayog karnaa shurukar detii he
 The native of this house knows the art of keeping his curiosity towards the mantras, mantras and tantras, mantras, knowing the samadhi state andsuch natives also know to visit the universe or desired places inside DhÄ«, after sleeping they dream different types of dreams in their dream state, and they also remember them well, they are any god and power
 See the effect of light as a bright light, that is why they are particularly interested in religion and religious fields, they can show the reasons of religion and religion in the world
 They resort to resources like video, audio, etc
, the person always has a mental desire that what happened, why and how it happened, always the person's thoughts should be successful, this type of person should never consider himself Even sometimes it is in danger, its cause is mainly visible when the person starts believing himself to be God, and whatever those around him tell or advise
 Do not then denying them is also considered one of the main reasons, This type of person seeks truth in the same way that a hungry person seeks food, because of the desire to know everything, such a person sometimes rears a very large Tenson, with the help of parapsychological powers
 Because of seeing the inner thoughts in the form of awakened thoughts by taking them and samadhi etc
, such a person believes that he too has seen God, he Tells Rishtis that the day and night he saw God in his dream and what he has said is going to be fulfilled, even physically these types of people are very keen on sky travel, jobs in air travel And parasuting is also very good for them, jumping from high places with physical means, performing tricks is also their habit, whenever such people do intensive study, is bhav kaa pluto jataka ke carrier ko andekhi takatein prabhavit karti he, asaamjik tatv sidhe tareeke se kaam or vyaktitv ko prabhavit karte he, logo ke dwaara jo raajnneeti khud vyakti ke prati kii jaatin hai, unase use bachanaa chaiye or khud ke vichaar or kaaryon ko mahatv diya janaa chaiye, jo bhi khud kii aukaat he usee par bharosha nahin karne se log use manachaahe tareeke se prayog karne kii koshish karte he
 Whenever this type of person tries to move forward, people come in the middle and give their opinion, and whatever he wants to do or tries to promote his name or business in the world, he should somehow Is stopped
 is prakaar kii ghatnaye jab vyakti ke jivan main aati he to use takat kii jarurat padati he yah takat usee prakaar se use chaiye hoti he, jis prakaar ek bydaree ko prayog karne ke baad use richarge karne kii padati he, is takat ko vah samaaj ke prati hi kharch karnaa chahta he, use apane liye kuch bhi prayog karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin padataa he, or jab bhi vah apni takaton ko samaaj ke liye kharch karata he to samaaj keval use buraai hi detaa he, or jis raste se vah apane ko bahut aage badhaane kii koshish karata he vahi rasta use nicha dikhaa detaa he, is prakaar ke vyakti kii aadat kuch karne or kuch dikhaane kii hoti he, aksar unhi kaamon ke andar uskaa man lagata he, jise shuru se ant tak koi samaj nahin paata he, vah jo kar rahaa hota he vah saamne nahin hota he, jo or jo ho rahaa hota he vah vastav main nahin hota
 Whatever kind of work is done by the people, there is a feeling inside the person as to why and for what they are doing that work, and why they are doing it only for personal benefit
 is bhav ke pluto vaale vyakti ko apane doston ke bharose kii bahut hi aavashyakta hoti he, kuch dost is bhav ke pluto vaale vyakti ko apane aadesh se chalaane kii koshish karte he, yaa vyakti apane aap hi doston ke ishaare par chalane kii koshish karata he, vah apane mata pita or parivaar ko bhul jaataa he, or jo bhe dost kehete hai unhi par vishwaas karne ke kaaran apane khud ke logon se apana vishwaas hataa letaa he, dosti kii bhaavana is prakaar ke vyakti ke andar kaafii seemaa tak bhari hoti he
 When filled with material substances, friends consider the person to be charismatic, and use physical substances fiercely, along with the support of a similar person in case of destruction or deterioration of some kind of material, Life gets promoted in the same way how many friends come and go from life, there is no stable friend, all this is considered to be the effect of Pluto of this sentiment
 Interpretation can

 Mulla ji refused to plead as a government lawyer
 atev adaalat ne bismil kii 18 july 1927 ko di gayi swayan vakaalat karne kii arji khaarij kar di
 He then presented a 76-page argumentative written debate, on which the judges expressed doubt that Bismil had written it by some jurist rather than himself
 antatogatva unheen lakshmishankar mishra ko bahes karne kii ijaajat di gayi jinhen lene se bismil ne manaa kar diya tha

 After this, a delegation of five persons led by Madan Mohan Malaviya went to Shimla and met the Viceroy again and prayed that as these four accused have given a written undertaking to the government that in future They will not participate in the activity and they have expressed remorse on their actions, so the decision of the High Court can be reconsidered
 But the Viceroy refused them outright
