sharir ke shesh bhaag main lagbhag 12 khand hote hai, jinamein se pratham teen khandon main prayek par ek jodi taange hoti hai
 Fourth and the sections behind them are also without legs
 kintu inke parivardhan main rukaawat aa jaati he or ye bahut hi chote rah jate hai
 In this way, the ovum of this six-legged ileus becomes a long adult at the end, which has many segments and many legs in the body
 yadi is dimbh kii pratham teen jodi ke pashchaatwali taangon ke parivardhan main adhik rukaawat ho or dimbh ke sharir ke lagbhag 12 khand praudhavastha main drudh rahen to yah jeev keet ke aakaar kaa hoga, jisamen pratham teen jodi taangon ke pechhevali taange yaa to itani ksheen hongi ki keval unke avshesh hi honge yaa ve sarvatha lupt hongi
 It is very interesting that in fact there are pests in which even the remains of the legs are present on the abdomen, such as Campodia, Japix and Matilis
 in kiton ke paksh nahin hote or inamen ve rachanaaen vartmaan rahati hai jo anya kiton main lupt ho gai hai, jaise janangranthiyon kaa khandibhavan
 Therefore, in the development of insects, these insects should understand the mid stage condition of the eggs and other insects born in the brain of Miriapoda
 anya anek tarkon se bhi yah anumodith hota he ki miriapoda kii tarah kii akritiyon se hi kiton kii utpatti hui he
 It is highly likely that myriapoda are the ancestors of insects in all those long-bodied and tangled organisms, because they contain many of the same creations, for example, malpigian tubules and tracheal tubules
 kintu iskaa bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki kiton kii utpatti praudh miriapoda se nahin ho sakati thi, kyonki inamen bahut si visheshtaayen or vilakshantaayen hai
 The Aperigota subclass is a group of mostly diverse insects and only the Thysanurae ganas of that subclass are probably close to the main category of growth of Terrigote insects
 aisa tark dwaara siddh kiya gaya he ki aptarigota ke shesh teen ganon ko keet maananaa hi nahin chahie
 However, there does not seem to be any satisfactory reason to separate these three ganas from this subclass, although there is no doubt that they exhibit unique compositions, for example the pests of Collenbola gana have only nine segments
 protura gana ke kiton main enamorphosis hota he, diplura, gana ke kiton main alakshanik trekial tantra paaya jaataa he, diplura or colembala kii shringikaaon ke kashabh main peshiyaan hoti hai
 The subclass Terrigota is divided into two parts - exopterigota and endopterigota
 exopterigota ganon ke affimeroptera or odoneta main paraspar nikat sambandh he, kyonki ye donon hi peliapteron, gana hai
 Blatteria, Mantodia, Isoptera, Joreptra, Gyloblatodia, Rhe Jupaj, Phaseamidea, Plicoptera, Dermaptera and Ambioptera r Jupaxica orthopteraid belong to the community, if considered from the body theory of modern insects
 nimnlikhit lakshanon ke kaaran ye sab gun ek samudaay banaate hai-aparivartit mukhbhaag, pashchapaksh main vishaal anelle lob udar ke pasch sire par ek jodi sarasai, aganit mailipagian nalikaayeor pratiprishth tantric tantu main kai ek pruthak-pruthak gucchhikaayen
 Of these Ganas, Blatteria and Mantodia have a very close relationship, placing them both together under Dictyoptera
 exopterigota ke shesh gana, jinke naam hai socoptera, mellophayga, simonculeta, matkunagan or jhallaripaksh, matkunaganik samudaay ke antargat aate hai
 The characteristics of the Mtkunganik community are as follows: special types of mandibulate or sucking mouth, anel lobes not found in the posterior side, lack of sarsai
 malepigian nalikaaon kii sankhya bahut thodi hoti he or pratiprishth tantriktantu kii gucchhikaaye lagbhag ekatribhoot ho jaati he
 There are no clear distinctions between the rheumatic and the mitochondrial communities, as the side veins in the Joraptera are somewhat weakened, the number of mallepigian tubules is even smaller, and the neoplasms are also slightly dilated
 socoptera or mellophayga main spasht sambandh prathit hota he, kyonki donon main vilakshan prakaar kaa hypofarics hota he
 Probably Cyphonculata is closely related to Malophaga
 inase ve keval anek bahya or aantarik rachanaaon tathaa prakruti main hi saadrishy nahin rakhte, apitu shwasaradhran kii rachana or andey se bachche nikalne kii vidhi main bhi saadrishy he
 Now the question arises as to why both lice of lice are not considered under the same gana
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki donon ganon ke mukhbhaagon main itnaa adhik antar hota he
 That it is often considered appropriate to keep them separately in different ganas
 indopterigot kiton ke vishay main dhyaan de to kalapaksh, strepciptera or kanchukpaksh ko anya ganon ke saath rakhane main atyadhik kathinata upasthit hoti he, at: inke atirikt shesh sab gana panorapid samudaay ke antargat rakhe gaye hai
 The panorepid community is centralized on the mykaptera with the laminae neuroptera and forms a few distinct microbial branches
 aisa adhik sambhav he ki micoptera ke nimnasth sadasyon se ek ore dwipaksh or duusari ore shalki paksh or lomapaksh kii utpatti hui ho
 The adults of Siphonaptera are very different in composition, but its ovum bipedal subgroups do not differ from some of the Poles of the nematosera, and if the genus Siphonaptera did not originate from the primordial bipedes, it would have at least been from the Panorapid community
 kalapaksh, kanchukpaksh or strepciptera ke vishay main bhi kuch kathinata prathit hoti he
 The subalpine of the acupuncture is conspicuous in the ovum of the symphyta and the ovum of the panorepid insects, as well as the origin of the vein on the sides of the symphyta appears to be from the megalopteran pattern, without difficulty
 in do kaarnon se aisa bhi kaha jaataa he ki kalapaksh ke purvaj tathaa jaalpaksh or anya panorapid ganon ke purvaj ek hi the
 There is a view of the Kunchuk side that they originated in a different way from other Indopterigot
 kintu kuch lekhakon kaa aisa anumaan he ki kanchukpaksh kii utpatti jaalpaksheeya akritiwale purvajon se hui
 Strepsiptera are often thought to be related to the ejaculate, but some authors determine their relationship to the appendage
 keet The insect keet The insect keet The insect upbhasha kisi bhashaa ke aise vishesh rup ko bolte hai jise us bhashaa ke bolne vaale logon main ek bhinn samudaay prayog karata ho
 Often called 'sub-languages' are regional types of a language, for example Chhattisgarhi, Harayanvi, Marwari, Brajbhasha and Khadiboli are some of the regional dialects of Hindi
 lekin kabhi-kabhi kisi samjik varg dwaara prayog hone vaali bhashaa kii qism ko bhi 'upbhasha' kah diya jaataa he
 Sometimes the dialect is also called dialect, although the term is also used for standard languages
 koi upbhasha apane vyakaran, shabdaawalee, lahaze or uccharan se jaani jaati he
 For example, there is a difference of words and grammar in standard Hindi and the standing words of Ruhelkhand: isi tarah saadhaaran punjabi bhashaa or punjabi kii hindko upbhasha main antar dekhe ja sakate hai: There is a statement of linguistics that 'sub-language with military and naval language is called language', that is, if the speakers of a language are successful in creating their own state or empire, then give it the status of a 'standard language' and related to it Other dialects appear to be the dialects of that standard language
 isi prakriya se maanak hindi ek bhashaa maani jaati he jabaki brajabhasha ek upbhasha kehalaati he
 a dialect is often called when: chimbel bharat ke goa rajya ke uttar goa jile main sthit ek janaganana nagar he
 As of 2001 India census, Chimbel has a population of 11,983
 kul jansankhya main purush 51%, or mahilaayein 49% hai
 It has an average literacy rate of 61%, higher than the national literacy rate of 59
5%, of which the male literacy rate is 67% and the female literacy rate is 54%
 14% log 0-6 varsh ayuvarg ke hai
 The word 'jyotish' means - Jyoti, ie, Prakashpanj, related thoughts
 ati pracheen kaal se hi isse us vidya kaa bodh hota rahaa he, jiskaa sambandh khagoleey pindon, arthath grahanakshatron, ke vivechan se he
 In this, the position of celestial bodies, their dynamics and their physical composition is considered
 atipracheen kaal main maanav kaa dhyaan in akashiya pindon kii ore gaya or usne sheeghra hi yah samaj liya ki grahanakshatron kii sthiti se vah dik, desh tathaa kaal kaa gyaan praapt kar saktaa he
 First of all, he turned his attention to the Sun and the Moon and also to the constellations he knew to be stable and against which he could measure the movements of the Sun and the Moon
 visheshtya usne un kshetrapunjon kaa adhyayan kiya jo surya tathaa chandramaa drishy kakshaon ke aasapaas the
 After 27 parts of Sun's visible orbit, he was named Ashwini, Bharani etc
 and after 12 parts of thirty parts of the same, put his zodiac sign Aries, Taurus etc
 raashichakr kaa adhyayan karte samay usne kuch aise pind jo dekhne main to tara sareekhe lagate the, kintu ve taron ke saapeksh purv kii taraf chalate dikhaai padate the
 He named them planets
 prithvi ko sthir mana tathaa surya, chandra sahit paanch chakshu drishy grahon, mangal, budh, brihaspati, shukr tathaa shani kaa gyaan praapt kiya
 From this, seven Vars of the week were named and that Panchagapadhathi was born which is still going on
 itnaa gyaan vishwa ke kuch deshon, visheshtya bharat tathaa greece ke nivaasiyon ko isa kii pehali athwa duusari shatabdi tak ho chukaa tha
 Due to the lack of perforation instruments and religious conventions, it could not progress
 aadhunik jyotish kaa janm koparnicus kii suryakendrik pranali ke siddhant, gallilyyon ke doordarshee, kepler ke anubhoot gatiniyamon tathaa newton ke vyapak gurutvkarshan siddhanton se hua
 From the point of view of theory, we can divide astrology into three parts: iske dwaara kisi bhi khagoleey pind kii bhumisthit drashtaa ke saapeksh sthiti ko gyaat kiya jaataa he
 For this, we imagine a seismically stable astrophysicist
 prithvi ke aksh ko yadi apni disha main badha diya jaay to vah jahaan par khagol main lagegaa use khagoleey dhruv kahenge
 That circle of astronomy, which will pass through the celestial pole and meridians, will be called post-meridian circle
 yadi shirobindu se yamyottar vrutt ke 90o ke chaap donon ore kaat len to un binduon se janevaale khagol ke vrutt ko khagoleey kshithijavrutt tathaa yamyottar vrutt ke us sampaat bindu ko, jo khagoleey dhruv kii ore he, uttarbindu tathaa duusari ore ke sampatbindu ko dakshinbindu kahenge
 If an arc of celestial circle is cut from the celestial pole at 90o on either side of the meridian, it is called the celestial equator
 surya kii drishy kaksha athwa prithvi kii vaastavik kaksha ko krantivrutt kehete hai
 Makes an angle of 23o 28 'from the ecliptic and the celestial equator
 krantivrutt tathaa khagoleey vishuvadvrutt ke sampaat ko vishuvabindu kehete hai
 The equinox at which the sun appears on March 21
 use vasantvishuv kehete hai
 The position of any celestial body is known from its coordinates
 nirdeshaankon ke liye ek mul bindu, khagol kaa vah brihadavrutt jisapar vah bindu he, brihadvrutt kaa dhruv, tathaa nirdeshaank kii dhan, rin dishaao kaa gyaan aavashyak he
 Suppose we have to find the regulator of a star
 yadi yamyottaravritt tathaa khagoleey vishuvadvrutt ke upar abhisht taragamee ek samakonvrutt khinche, to is vrutt par yamyottar tathaa vishuvadvrutt ke sapaat se pashchim kii ore dhan disha maanane par jitna chaap kaa ansh hoga vah uskaa hora kone tathaa samakon vrutt ke mul se abhisht tara tak samakoniya vrutt ke chaap ko kranti kahenge
 If the revolution is towards the celestial pole, money will be otherwise debt
 yadi basantvishuv ko mulbindu maane or khagoleey dhruv se vishuvadvrutt par samakon vrutt khinchen to vishuvabindu se samakonvrutt ke mul tak, ghadi kii sooyee kii ulti disha main, jitne chaap ke ansh honge unhen vishuvaansh kahenge
 The position of the celestial body is also known by equinox and revolution
 yah nirdeshaank paddati bahut mahatvapurn he
 If you draw a right angled circle on the celestial body favored by the meridians, then the distance from the north point to the celestial body in the clockwise direction and the distance of the equator of the right angle will be azimuth and the distance from the horizon of the arc of the right angled circle to the celestial body
 yadi tara ke upar krantivrutt ke dhruv se ek samakonvrutt khinche to vah jahaan krantivruth se lagegaa yahan tak vasantsampaat se lekar ghadi kii sooyee kii viruddh disha main krantivrutt ke chaap ke anshon kaa bhogaansh tathaa katanbindu se tara tak samakonvrutt ke chaap ke anshon ko vikshep kahenge
 This money direction will be like a revolution
 yadi vishuvasampaat ke sthaan par akashganga ke vishuvad tathaa khagoleey vishuvad kaa sampatbindu len tathaa krantivrutt ke dhruv ke sthaan par akashganga ke vishuvadvrutt kaa dhruv len to hamen akashgangeey bhogaansh tathaa vikshep praapt honge
 If Vasantvishuv is considered stable, then the time of the sun's arrival from the spring point is called the sidereal year
 yah 365
25636 din kaa hota he
 Due to the axis of the Earth moving equatorward, it retreats about 50
2 per year
 surya ke chal vishuvasampaat kii ek parikrama ke samay ko sayan varsh kehete hai
 It is 365
2422 days long
 vaastavik surya kii gati ek si nahin dikhalaai detii
 Therefore, for the census, the astrology-mean-sun is imagined at a speed in the equinox
 uske ek yamyottar gaman se duusare yamyottar gaman ko madhya-surya-din kehete hai
 This is the time our watches give
 vastavasurya tathaa jyotish-madhya-surya ke horakon ke antar ko kalsamikar kehete hai
 Due to atmospheric oscillations, appendages, seismic parallaxes, and aeons and oscillation speeds, the sky is visible to us from the space available by mathematics somewhat
 at: vaastavik sthiti kaa gyaan karne ke liye hamen usamen upyukt sanshodhan karne padate hai
 In kinetic astrology, we gain knowledge of the movements, orbits, etc
 of celestial bodies using Newton's extensive gravitational theory
 isamen ham saapeksh sanshodhan kar dete hai
 It has been successfully used in solar systems, paired stars, and polythene systems
 bhautik jyotish main ham akashiya pindon kii bhautik sthitiyon kaa gyaan praapt karte hai
 Our main instruments for this are spectroscope, photometer, and radio telescope
 varnakram vishleshan se ham akashiya pind ke vayumandal, taapmaana, multatv aadi kaa gyaan praapt karte hai
 We usually divide celestial bodies into three parts: surya tathaa uske parivaar ke sadsy, Stars and akashgangaayen The Sun is our nearest star
 yah gaison se bana gola he, jiskaa vyas 13,93,000 kilometre he
 Its mean diameter is 31 '59
3 0

 Where there are sun rays, there is a lot of brilliance
 surya kaa vayumandal utkraman parat se prarambh hota he
 It should be considered part of the Sun's actual atmosphere
 yah sainkadon mile ghanaa he tathaa iskaa taap prakashmandal se kam he
 It is rich in hydrogen and helium, small amounts of silicon, oxygen and other familiar gases will also be found
 utkraman paraton ke upar varnmandal he
 It is visible only on the occasion of complete eclipse
 iskaa vistaar 6,000 mile tak he
 It contains calcium, hydrogen and helium
 iskaa vista ekarup nahin he
 There are some important shapes of the Sun in the alphabet, one of which is the flames of a flying fire, which is called a solar flame
 kabhi kabhi ye surya ke prakashmandal se hajaaron mile upar uthi dikhaai detii hai
 On the occasion of a full eclipse, when the image of the Sun is completely covered by the Moon, then the very bright light visible above the spectrum is called Suryakirit
 jo khagoleey pind surya kii parikrama karte hai ve saura parivaar ke sadsy hai
 These include planets, satellites, asteroids, orbits and meteors
 ve khagoleey laghu thos pind jo kisi taare kii, visheshtya surya kii, parikrama karte hai grah hai
 The planets of the solar family are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Guru Shani, Varuni and Varuna
 inamen budh, shukr, prithvi, mangal tathaa yama chote hai tathaa guru, vaaruni or varun vishaal hai
 The orbits of Mercury and Venus fall within the Earth's orbit relative to the Sun
 at: inhen antargrah kehete hai
 The rest are extraterrestrials
 grah aisi dirghavrittakar kakshaon main bhraman karte hai, jinaki ek naabhi main surya he
 The simple line going from both the nerves to the circumference is called the long axis and the perpendicular part of the perpendicular line from the center of the ellipse to the long axis
 dirghavritt paridhi kaa vah bindu jo ravi ke nikat deergh aksh par sthit he use ravinich, tathaa jo bindu deergh aksh ke duusari ore he use suryocch kehete hai
 The long axis has sunrise and Ravinech positions, so it is called the lowermost line
 ravinich se naabhi sthit surya par paridhi kaa kone konikantar kehalaata he
 The orbital period relative to the planet's Ravinech or Sunrise is called Variksha
 grahon kii kakshaayen krantivrutt ke dharaatal main nahin hai, kintu usase jhuki hui hai
 The orbit of the planet and the endpoint of the eclipse is called the path
 jahaan se grah krantivrutt se upar kii ore jaataa he vah bindu arohpaat kehalaata he tathaa doosraa aavrohpaat
 To know the position of the planet in the sky, we need to know the long axis of the planet, eccentricity, the orbit from the orbit, direction, direction of the sun and position of the sun
 grahon main ghurnan tathaa parikraman kii do prakaar kii gatiyaan pai jaati hai
 One is that they revolve around the Sun in their orbit, this is called their rotation
 jab koi grah kisi taare ke saapeksh surya kii parikrama karata he, to use uskaa nakshatra kaal kehete hai
 The period of rotation of the planet with respect to the Earth is called Samyuti Kaal
 prithvi ke nivaasiyon ko bahirgrah to prithvi kii parikrama karte dikhalaai dete hai, kintu antargrah surya se purv tathaa pashchim dolan karte dikhalaai dete hai
 This is due to the special status of their classes
 prithvi ke saapeksh antargrah kii surya se charamkoniya duuri ko charam vitan kehete hai
 When the ingress is in the simple line joining the sun and the earth, it is called the exclusion of the planet, and when the simple line joining the sun and the earth passes through the center of the sun, it is called Bahiruti
 bahirgrah ko prithvi se milaanevaali rekha jab surya main se hokar jaati he, to use sanyuti tathaa jab grah prithvi or surya ko milaanevaali rekha ke bich main rahata he to use grah kii viyuti kehete hai
 The time from one joint of the planet to the other is called the joint
 This is the time of exterminations, relative to the Earth, the period of rotation of the zodiac
 antargrah praaia: prithvi kii parikrama kaal main hi raashichakr kii parikrama karte hai
 In their orbits, the direction of motion seems to be the same, and the movements of the inguinal asymmetry seem to move in the opposite direction to the Earth during the adjacent period of the outward phase
 is kaaran ye hamen raashichakr main pashchim kii ore jate dikhalaai dete hai
 This is the curve of the planets
 grahon kii, vakrgati praapt karne ke kuch samay purv, prithvi ke saapeksh gati sthir ho jaati he
 This makes the planets seem stable
 antaryuti athwa viyuti ke samay main grah kii vakr gati parmadhik hoti he1 uske kuch kaal baad yah kam hone lagati he, phir grah sthir prathit hokar ruju gati se chalate lagata he
 The illuminated parts of the intuitions continue to be less and more illuminated like the moon and receive these arts
 inke aakaaron ke ati chota hone ke kaaran bina yantra ke inaki kalaayen dikhalaai nahin padatin
 The arts of extraterrestrials are always seminal
 jas prakaar grah surya ke gurutvkarshan ke kaaran surya kii parikrama karte hai, usee prakaar upgrah grahon kii parikrama karte hai
 It is clear from the law of broad gravity that their mass quantities are less than their planets
 prithvi ke upgrah kaa chandramaa kehete hai
 The Moon has a lot to do with our lives
 dharmik krityon ke liye abhi bahut se deshon main chandra maason kaa vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 The Moon was considered a planet in ancient times
 prithvi ke atirikt mangal ke do, guru ke 12, shani ke 9, vaaruni ke 5, tathaa varun ke 2 upgrah hai
 Mercury, Venus and Yama do not have any satellite 1 jab chandramaa prithvi or surya ke bich main aa jaataa he to amavasya ke din prithvi par drishy surya kaa bhaag usase dhak jaataa he
 This is called solar eclipse
 isi prakaar jab poornima kii raat main chandramaa prithvi kii chaaya main pravisht hokar prakashahin ho jaataa he to use chandragrahan karte hai
 Eclipses of Sun and Moon are very famous
 surya ke grahanon se surya ke vayumandal tathaa kirit kii prakruti ke adhyayan main bahut sahaayta milti he
 The velocity of light was first determined by studying the eclipses of the Guru's satellites
 chandramaa dwaara taaraon ke dhake jane ko taraprachhaadan kehete hai ! Bode had given the following rules to find the distances of planets from the Sun in astrological unit - du 0
4 + 0
3 ́ 2na, jahaan na = - ¥, 0,1,2,3,4, xxrep 8 
 isse budh kii duuri 0
4, shukr kii duuri = 0
7, prithvi kii duuri --1
0 tathaa mangal kii duuri 1
6 praapt hui
 Even this is usually fine, but the distance of the Guru does not fit with this rule
 parantu yadi ham bich main kisi or grah kii kalpana kar len, to shesh grahon kii dooriyaan is niyam se thik baith jaati hai
 That is why astrologers started exploring other planets between Mars and Guru's orbit
 isse unhen bahut se kshudragrah mili
 The first asteroid Sito was invented in January 1801 AD by Italian astrologer Piazzi
 san 1950 main kshudragrahon kii sankhya 1,600 tak pahunch gai thi
 It is estimated that their number will be 100,000
 ye ati nune ghanatvvaali dravyamatra ke bane akashiya pind hai, jo surya ke sameep aane par surya se vipareet disha main bahut dur tak puchh jaise apane bhaag ko prakashit karte hai
 Their size is mainly divided into two parts
 golakaar ghaney prakashit bhaag ko sir tathaa halake prakashit bhaag ko puchh kehete hai
 They have a nucleus in the head
 ye surya ke niyantran main shankav margon main jate hai
 Some of these orbits appear to be parabolic and hyperbolic, which seems to have made them a member of the solar family, perhaps because of their fascination
 bahut se dhoomaketu dirghavrittakar kakshaon main niyatkaal main parikraman karte hai
 Among these, the comet of Hali is famous
 dhoomaketuon kii gati par guru kaa atyadhik prabhaav padataa he
 Due to this, their class changes
 pracheen kaal main dhoomaketu kaa dikhaai padana anisht kaa suchak mana jaataa tha
 Often during the night, some bright substances are seen coming from the earth with extreme speed
 inhen tara kaa tootna yaa ulkapaat kehete hai
 Meteors are visible to us only when they penetrate the Earth's atmosphere with extreme force
 inkaa veg 11 se lekar 62 kilometre prati second tak rahata he
 When they are within a distance of 100 and 120 km from our surface, we are first seen and become invisible when we reach a distance of 50 or 60 kilometers
 vastut: prithvi ke ghaney vayumandal main ativeg se ghusane par inke dravya main aag utpann ho jaati he or ye jal jaati hai
 Their quantity is very small
 kabhi kabhi ulkaaye jab prithvi par girti hai to bade bade gaddhe bana detii hai
 If our atmosphere does not protect us, the meteorite will cause a lot of damage to the Earth and us
 ye garam gaison se swayamprakashit khagoleey pind hai, jo apane dravya ko nijee gurutvkarshan se sambhddha rakhte hai
 Groups of stars take a special shape, these are called constellations
 krantivrutt ke kshetra ke taramandalon ko raashi kehete hai, jo mesh, vrish, mithun aadi 12 hai
 Some part of Sarpadhar is between Scorpio and Sagittarius
 krantivrutt tathaa khagoleey dhruv ke bich 21 tathaa sarpdhar ke shesh bhaag or krantivrutt tathaa dakshini khagoleey dhruv ke bich 47 taramandal hai
 In the international system, some of their names are based on Greek mythology and some have Arabic names
 nakshatron ke ashvini, bharni, mrigashira aadi ke bhartiya naam bhi puranakthaon se sambhddha hai
 The Greek alphabet is used to indicate the order of the brightness of stars in zodiac signs
 jis taramandal main taron kii sankhya varnmaala ke aksharon se adhik hoti he, unki chamak ke kram ko ankon dwaara bhi vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Each record is 2
5 times brighter than its next
 kantimaan jitna kam hoga utana hi taron kii saapeksh chamak 2
5 guna bad jaaegi
 In this way, the ratio of brightness of the stars of 1 to 6 will be 100: 40: 16: 6
3: 2
5: 1
 taron ke rang se unke taap kaa gyaan hota he
 Color is also detected by looking without a machine, but for subtle knowledge, color-coated coating plates, films and spectral photography are used
 keval aankh se drishy taron kii sankhya lagbhag 6,500 he
 Of these, about 20 stars are of 1 to 1
5 strength, 50 stars are second, 150 stars are third, 500 stars are fourth, 1,500 stars are fifth and rest are in sixth
 keval aankh se, chathe kantimaan se kam chamkile taare nahin dekhe ja sakate
 With the help of a 200-inch diameter telescope, stars up to the 23rd can be seen
 ab tak bade doordarshiyon dwaara dekhe gaye hamaari akashganga ke taron kii sankhya 1011 he
 Divide the motions of the stars into two parts
 ek to vah, jisase hamaare dekhne kii disha main aage peeche hatate hai, duusari vah, jisase taare atidurvarti taron ke saapeksh kisi disha main hatate dikhaai dete hai

 90% of patients die in it
 is rog kii pahchaan sarvapratham san 1976 main ibola nadi ke paas sthit ek gaanv main kii gai thi
 This is why it was named Ebola
 ibola ek aisa rog he jo marij ke sampark main aane se failata he

 These are the following: is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Swine influenza ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 Pig influenza is an infectious disease caused by the holder of one of several unique species of microbe named "swine influenza virus"
 2009 main sanchaar madhyam ne isko swine flukaha jo ek nai nasl a / H1N1 pandemic virus se hota he, vaise hi jaise isse pehle 'bird flu' hua tha jis flu ne haal hi main asian-vanshavali HPAI H5N1 naam ke virus se hota he jo kai deshon main sthaneey junglee pakshiyon ke kai prajatiyon main paaya jaataa he, se hota tha
 a swine influenza virus that is commonly the host virus found in pigs
 varsh 2009 ke anusaar SIV bhed main influenza c virus or upbhed influenza a virus jo H1N1, H1N2, H3N1, H3N2, H2N3, ke rup main mana jaataa he, se hota he
 Swine flu is common in pig populations worldwide
 boar influenza aam taur par suaron se manushyon main nahin failata he or aksar maanav influenza kaa kaaran nahin hota he, tathaa aksar iske falswaroop rakt main keval antibody hi paidaa hote hai
 If the meat of the animal is cooked properly, there is no risk of infection
 yadi sankraman ke kaaran maanav influenza hota he to use junotic boar flu kehete hai
 People who work with pigs and live with them are more at risk of swine flu
 20veen shatabdi ke madhya main, influenza upabhedon kii pahchaan sambhav ho sakaa, jo manushya ke liye sancharan ke sahi nidaan kii jaankaree detaa he
 Since then, fifty transmission confirmations have been recorded
 is tarah kii nasal ek manushya se dusre manushya main bahut kam hi pravesh karata he
 Symptoms of swine flu in humans are basically symptoms of influenza or influenza-like symptoms, such as chills, fever, sore throat, muscle aches, severe headache, cough, weakness, and general discomfort
 Pigs can also be infected with human influenza, and this was thought to occur during the 1918 flu pandemic
 maanav main yah 2009 kaa boar flu ek nai nasal kii influenza a ke kaaran hui he jo boar influenza ke jeenon se miltijulati he
 The origin of this new breed is unknown
 haalanki, vishwa pashu swasthya sanghathan ke report ke anusaar is tarah kaa flu siiron main alag nahin he
 It can be transmitted from human to human and may show common signs of influenza
 influenza virus kii teen jatiyaan jo manushya flu kaa kaaran ho sakati hai, un main se do siiron main influenza kaa kaaran he, influenz virus a in main aam he or influenza virus c durlabh he
 Influenza virus has not yet been reported in b pigs
 influenz virus a or influenza virus c main manushya or siiron main paae jane vaale bhed alag-alag hai
 Due to classification, the boundaries between jeans, pigs, birds and human species continue to be crossed
 influenza c virus, manushya or boar ko sankramit karata he par pakshiyon ko sankramit nahin karata he
 In the past there was an infection between pigs and humans
 udhaaharan ke liye, influenza c japan or california main bacchon ke bich paaya gaya
 apni simit vaahak seemaa ke kaaran or influenza c main anuvanshik vividhta kii kami ke kaaran, yah influenza maanav main mahamariyon ke rup main dikhaai nahin detaa
 Pig influenza is caused by influenza a and strains H1N1, H1N2, H3N1, H3N2, and H2N3
 siiron main, teen influenza a virus upbhed ke rup main vishvabhar main dikhaai detaa he
 In the United States prior to the year 1998, the H1N1 strain was particularly prevalent among pigs, and in late 1998, in August, the H3N2 strains were found isolated in pigs
 As of the year 2004, H3N2 viruses were isolated in the United States and Turkey with three types of taxonomy and were found in human, pig and avian lineages
 yadhyapi sanyukt rajya america main siiron main koun se virus sanchaarit ho rahe hai isko nirdhaarit karne vaali koi pranali nahin he par anaupchaarik rup se ek rashtriya niyantran pranali he, jo vishwa niyantran network kaa ek hissaa he
 Veterinarian, Tracy mcnamara, has established a national disease control system at the zoo as they keep active control of the disease at the zoo and many exotic animals live extensively there
 kai prajatiyaan kisi bhi sangheey agenciyon ke radar se neeche hoti hai, haalanki ve maanav beemaari failane ke kaarnon kaa jaldi pataa lagane main mahatvapurn ho sakati he
 Pig influenza was first known as a human-related influenza, which was discovered during the flu pandemic of 1918 when pigs, like humans, fell ill like humans
 At first this influenza virus started appearing as a disease of pigs from the year 1930 onwards
 In the next 60 years, swine influenza was only H1N1
 phir, teen alag alag upbhed varsh 1997 or 2002 ke bich paae gaye jo teen nayi jatiyon or paanch alag genes main uttar america ke siiron ke bich main influenza ke rup main ubhare
 1997-1998 main, H3N2 jatiyaan ubhari
 ye vanshaanu, jo maanav, boar or avian virus ke vargeekaran ke kaaran bane or uttar america main boar influenza kaa ek bada kaaran ho gaye hai
 The classification of H1N1 and H3N2 produced H1N2
 varsh 1999 main canada main H4N6 jatiyaan pakshiyon kii seemaa se paar hokar suaron kii seemaa main chali gayi jo ek hi prakaar main nihit thim
 The H1N1 type of swine flu is of the lineage of the 1918 flu pandemic
 siiron main bhi dikhaai dene vaala yah virus varsh 1918 main bhi 20 veen sadi ke maanav ke madhyam se dikhaai dene laga jo saamaanya mausami influenza main dikhaai detaa he
 Although it is not broadcast live directly from humans to pigs, only 12 cases have appeared in the US since 2005
 However, strains of this influenza seen in pigs later disappeared from human populations where they could contain the influenza virus, which later came to infect them when the human disease capacity decreased
 suar flu, ek vyapak vitaran ke saath-saath simit vitaran ke rup main maanav main junosis ke rup main kai baar suchit kiya gaya he
 This outbreak is common in pigs and causes significant economic losses in the industry which is primarily considered as a feat and an extension of the market
 udhaaharan ke liye, yah rog british maance udyog ke liye 65 karod pound salanaa kharch karwaati he
 The flu epidemic of 1918 appeared as H1N1 and swine influenza
 yah junosis suaron se manushyon ko yaa manushya se siiron ko hoti dikhaai detii he
 Although there was no evidence in which direction this virus is transferred, according to the evidence obtained, the disease has come from humans in pigs
 udhaaharan ke rup main, swine influenza varsh 1918 main nae rog ke rup main janaa gaya jab yah influenza manushya main paaya gaya
 haalanki vanshanuvishlation se yah pataa chalata he ki haal kii influenza jatiyaan maanav, pakshiyon or siiron main dekhne ko mili jo varsh 1918 main yah vargeekaran kisi standhari jeev ke dwaara hota hua paaya gaya
 varsh 1918 tak iskaa sahi pataa nahin chalaa
 On February 5, 1976, Fort Dix, a man in the US Army, said he felt tired and weak
 vah baad main mar gaya or baad main uske chaar saathi sainik aspataal main bhartee hue
 uski maut ke do hafte baad swasthya adhikariyon ne yah bataaya ki uski maut kaa kaaran boar kii ek nai nasl flu he
 This species was considered a variant of H1N1 called a / New Jersey / 1976
 It was discovered until 19 January and 9 February and did not spread again after Fort Dix
 yah nayi jati varsh 1918 kii flu mahamari se sambandhit jati kii tarah dikhaai detii he
 In addition, this surveillance detected another caste specific in America
 a / Victoria / 75 spread and caused illness and persisted until March
 Public health officials were alerted and then decided to prevent another major pandemic and urged President Gerald Ford to give the vaccine to all people in the United Nations
 yah tikaakaran kaarykram jansampark samasyaon or deriyon ke kaaran samay par nahin ho paae
 1 oktober 1976 ko, tikaakaran kaarykram shuru hua or 11 oktober tak, lagbhag 40 karod log, yaa aabaadi kaa lagbhag 24% ne boar flu se bachaav praapt kiya
 On the same day, three senior citizens died after receiving the swine flu vaccine and there the media tried to link those deaths to vaccination, although they found no positive evidence for this
 According to science writer Patrick Di Justo, by the time the truth was discovered that the deaths had no connection with the vaccine - it was too late
 "sarkaar ne lambey samay tak shookar flu ke bare main dar tha - to ab ve boar flu ke tikaakaran ke bare main darane lage
" is kaarykram ke liye yah ek bahut bada jhatka tha
 According to reports, people who received swine flu vaccine were found to have guillain-barré syndrome, a type of neuromuscular disorder
 yah syndrome aadhunik influenza tike kaa ek durlabh nakaaratmak asar tha jo prati das lakh logon main se ek maamla is ghatana kaa hota tha
 As a result, De Justo wrote that "the public gave up trusting in government-run health programs that killed older people and crippled young people
" By the end of 1976, at least 33% of the population received vaccines
 Had done rashtriya influenza tikaakaran kaarykram 16 disambar tak samaapt kar diya gaya
 In total, there were 500 cases of guillain-barré syndrome, out of which 25 people died of lung complications
 dow pi
 habar ke anusaar, varsh 1976 kaa yah tikaa ek tarah ke rog-nidaan tikaakaran ke kaaran utpann hua
 Other influenza vaccines have not been linked to GBS
 Those who had a history of GBS were already alerted
 pratirakshan kaarykram main bhaag lene vaale ek bhagidaar ke dwaara yah mana gaya ki is rog se zyada america vaasiyon ko is tike ne maar daalaa
 In September 1988, a swine flu virus killed one woman and infected others
 32-year-old Barbara Ann Wieners was eight months pregnant when she and her husband, Ed, went to Walworth County at a county fair named Wisconsin and fell ill
 barbara aath din baad, neumonia se maari gayi
 The only pathogen identified within it was the swine influenza virus of the H1N1 species
 doctoron ke parishram se use prerit kiya gaya or marane se pehle usne ek swasth beti ko janam diya
 uskaa pati baad main thik hua
 ILI was widely found in all the pigs displayed at the boar fair
 Out of 25 boar exhibitors, 76% of boar exhibitors who were in the age group of 9 to 19 found positive SIV antibody
 But none of this group had any serious illness
 atirikt adhyayan se yah pataa chalaa ki jo rogi swasthya karmiyon ke sampark main the unamem halkaa influenza viksit hua, vaise hi jaise boar ke pratipind ke saath bimariyon kaa sankraman hota he
 However, there was no community outbreak
 varsh 1998 main, boar flu chaar america rajyon main paae gaye
 Within a year, it spread among pig populations across the United States
 Scientists believe that the virus originated from pigs which appear as flu strains from birds and humans
 isse yah pataa chalaa ki boar ek crucible ke rup main ubhar kar aate hai jahaan nae influenza virus alag upabhedon se jeenon ke vargeekaran ke parinaam ke rup main vibhinn jatiyon main dikhaai dete hai
 On 20 August 2007, officials of the Department of Agriculture investigated the outbreak in Nueva Esija and Central Luzon, Philippines
 Death rate due to swine flu is less than 10%, unless there are complications such as hog cholera
 27 july 2007 ko, philippine rashtriya maance nirikshan seva ne boar haija ke prati "red alert" kii ghoshnaa kii, jahaan metro manila ke saath-saath bulaakaan or pumpanga ke pichhawade boar farm se yah rog lujon ke paanch praanton main fail gaya, jabaki yah swine flu ke liye nakaartmak siddh hua tha
 The 2009 flu outbreak was thought to be a new strain of the strain H1N1 that had not previously been reported in pigs
 april ke uttarardh main margaret chaan, vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke mahanideshak, ne "antarrashtriya chintaa kii ek saarvajanik swasthya apaat sthiti", kii ghoshnaa dablyuechao kii nai antarrashtriya swasthya viniyamon ke anusaar di jab H1N1 virus ke pratham maamle ke bare main sanyukt rajya america ko soochna mili
iske tahat, 2 may 2009 ko, jab mexico main iske failane kii soochna mili to yah paaya gaya ki isaki kadi alberta, canada, ke ek farm main dikhaai di
 in siiron, ne is nayi nasal ko ek majdoor se praapt kiya lagata he jo haal hi main mexico se lautaa tha or jisame influenza ke lakshan dikhaai dene lage the
 These are possible cases, which are pending confirmation in the laboratory
 yah nayi nasal kii influenza a tarah ke virus vargeekaran dwaara chaar tarah kii jatiyon se H1N1 ke upbhed se yukt hokar varnit kiye gaye hai, inamen se ek manushya se, ek pakshiyon se or do boar se aaye hai
 } Further analysis revealed that it consisted of two types of species found in pigs
 haalanki shuruaati reporton main is nayi jati ko boar influenza kaha gaya par uskaa mul abhi bhi agyaat he
 Many countries have taken several precautionary measures to treat the disease as a possibility of a global pandemic
 mrityu dar ko drushti main rakhte hue swine flu kii tulana kai anya suar flu influenza virus se kii gayi he
 "in America it seems that out of every 1000 people who get infected, 40 people have to go to hospital and one person dies
 is baat kaa bhi dar he ki boar flu sardiyon ke maheenon main ek pramukh vaishvik mahamari ban jaayegi or isliye kai desh tikaakaran abhiyaan kii yojana bana rahe hai
 Influenzae are common in pigs because more than half of the breeding pigs of pigs in the United Nations have been exposed to the virus
 is vishaanu ke antibody anya deshon main bhi aam hai
 The main cause of transmission is through direct contact between infected and uninfected animals
 ye sampark visheshkar pashu parivahan ke dauraan aam hai
 Intensive farming can also increase the risk of transmission because the pigs are very close to each other
 virus kaa sidhaa hastantaran shaayad yaa to siiron ke naak se yaa sookhe shleshm ke madhyam dwaara hota he
 Airborne infection also occurs when these pigs either cough or sneeze
 yah virus aamtaur par ek jhund ke madhyam se kuch hi dinon main bahut jaldi failata he
 Infection can also be from other wild animals
 kuch hi dinon ke bheetar sabhi siiron se sankraman failata he
 This infection can also be caused by wild boar, or wild animals that spread the disease from the farm
 jo log kukkut or siiron ke saath kaam karte hai, ve in ke gahan jokhim main aate hai
 Such people are at risk of zoonotic infection which is found in virus animals
 iske kaaran ek aabaadi ise ban sakati he jisame manushya iske vaahak ho sakate hai or inamen junosis or vargeekaran sambhav ho saktaa he
 Vaccination of these employees against influenza and surveillance against the new influenza species may be a good measure of public health
 varsh 2004 main lova vishvavidhyalay main, jo log swine ke saath kaam karte hai, ne shookar se influenza kaa manushya main sthaanantaran, par ek choti si nigaraanee adhyayan main pralekhith kiya
 The study has formed the basis, among others, that swine is a public health monitoring center for people whose jobs are based on pigs
 anya vyavsaay jinamein yah sankraman adhik hota he, ve hai, pashu chikitsak or maance prasanskaran kaaryakarta, haalanki in donon samoohon ke liye sankraman kaa khatra farm ke mazdooron se kam hota he
 Pigs are unusual because they can be infected with three different species of influenza strains: pigs, birds and humans
 This makes pigs to be carriers of the influenza virus where gene exchange as well as producing new and dangerous species 
 avian influenza virus H3N2 china ke suaron main sthanikmaari vaale he or in kii pahchaan vietnam ke siiron main bhi kii gai he, jiske kaaran nae upabhedon ke udbhav kii ashanka bad jaati he
 H3N2 evolved from antigenic to H2N2
 agast 2004 main, shodhakartaaon ne chinamen siiron main H5N1 ko paaya
 These H5N1 infections can be quite common: a survey of 10 healthy pigs revealed that the H5N1 virus was contained in a sample of five pigs when a bird flu was detected at a poultry farm in West Java
 indonesian sarkaar ko is kshetra main isi tarah ke parinaam mili
 is kshetra ke baahar 150 siiron par kiye gaye atirikt pareekshan nakaaratmak rahe
 Influenza infection in pigs causes fever, lethargy, sneezing, coughing, difficulty breathing and loss of appetite
 kuch maamalon main sankraman se garbhpaat bhi ho jaataa he
 Although mortality is generally low, viruses reduce weight as well as growth, causing economic losses to farmers
 sankramit siiron ke sharir kaa vajan 3 se 4 hafton kii avadhi main 12 pound se adhik kam ho jaataa he
 Direct infection of swine flu virus from pigs to humans can only occasionally be possible
 According to medical literature reports, 50 cases have been received till date from the first case registered in the year 1958, out of which six have died
 chah logon main se ek garbhvatee thi, ek ko khun kaa cancer tha, ek hodgkin kaa rogi tha or do swasth bataaye jate hai
 Although this is a low number of infections, the exact rate of infection is not known, as in most cases only very mild disease can occur, which will neither be reported or will ever be diagnosed
 centre rog niyantran or rokthaam, ke anusaar maanav main boar flu 2009 ke "H1N1 virus" influenza or influenza ke samaan beemaari kii tarah hi lagata he
 These symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, chills and fatigue
 varsh 2009 ke prakope main zyaadaatar rogiyon ko dast or ulti hote dikhaai die hai
 The 2009 H1N1 virus is not zoonotic swine flu, as it is not transmitted from swine to man, person to person
 kyonki ye lakshan boar flu ke liye vishisht nahin hai
 a differential diagnosis of probable swine flu is that swine flu should show symptoms in a person that are due to that person's recent history
 udhaaharan ke liye, 2009 main sanyukt rajya main boar flu failane ke dauraan sidisi ne chikitsakon se kaha ki ve "boar flu se peedit logon ko jinamein fever ke saath-saath gambhir saans kii beemaari kii pushti hui he, ve jo swine flu ke vyaktiyon se sampark praapt kar chuke hai, jo sanyukt raashtra ke un paanch rajyon main the jahaan se swine flu se log grast hue hai, jo biimaar hone se 7 din pehle mexico main nivas kar rahe the, par vichaar karne ko kaha he"
 swine flu kii pushti ke liye prayogshaala pareekshan kii aavashyaktaa he Prevention of swine influenza has three components: prevention of swine, prevention of transmission to humans and prevention of its spread among humans
 siiron ke bich main influenza ke prasar ko rokane ke tareeke hai - prabandhan kii suvidha, jhund kaa prabandhan or tikaakaran
 kyonki adhiktar beemaari or maut boar flu se jude anya rogazanqon dwaara hoti he, tikaakaran par nirbhar niyantran aparyaapt ho sakati hai
 In recent decades it has been difficult to control swine influenza by vaccination, with the emergence of the virus making conventional vaccination inconsistent
 maanak vanijyik boar flu tikon ke sankraman ko niyantrit karne main prabhavi hote hai, jab virus upbhed mahatvapurn sangrakshan ke liye paryaapt he or vishisht virus ke dwaara banaayi gayi davaaiyaan jatil maamalon main prayog kii jaati hai
 Vaccines designed for SIV control and prevention are used for SIV vaccination in swine firms that are commercially available in the United States
 haal hi main jo 97 H3N2 pruthak rakhe gayi virason kaa jaanch kiya gaya to yah paaya gaya ki unamem se 41 virus shaktisaali hai or inamen teen virdohi pratikriyaayein hai
 The protective potential of influenza vaccines depends largely on the close association between the vaccine virus and the pandemic virus, with the ineffective H3N2 variants located in the SIV suggesting that current commercial vaccines cannot effectively protect pigs from H3N2 infection viruses
 sanyukt rajya krishi vibhaag ke shodhakartaaon kaa kahana he ki jab tak suar tikaakaran se boar biimaar hote rahenge tab tak yah sankraman rukta nahin he
 Facility management includes controlling the virus existing in the environment as well as creating an insect-resistant environment
 yah virus do saptaah se zyada jivit koshikaon ke baahar ji nahin saktaa he, lekin thand main, keitanurahit vaataavaran main yah sust pad jaataa he
 Herd management does not mean the inclusion of pigs carrying influenza in the herd that have been exposed to the virus
 yah virus swasth siiron main 3 maheene tak rahata he or in main se prakope ke samay baraamad kiya ja saktaa he
 Carrier pigs are usually responsible for introducing SIV into uninfected herds or in the country so that new animals are kept separately from them
 After its spread, disease outbreaks power in infected pigs decreases, so its outbreak increases
 suar influenza, maanav influenza or avian influenza donon upabhedon se ho saktaa he, ye in pratijani ke vaahak ho jate hai jo ek nae influenza kii jati ko paidaa kar sakate hai
 The transfer from pigs to humans occurs mainly in farms where farmers are in close contact with pigs
 yadhyapi boar influenza kii jatiyaan aamtaur par manushyon ko sankramit karne main sakasham nahin he par yah kabhi-kabhi sambhav ho jaataa he, isliye kisaanon or pashu chikitsakon ko chehre par mukhauta daal kar sankramit pashuon se nipatna chahie
 boar par tikon kaa upyog, sankraman ko rokane ke liye, maanav main prasaaran hone se bachane kii ek pramukh vidhi he
 Risk factors that contribute to infection from swine to humans are smoking and non-wearing of gloves when working with animals
 manushyon ke bich sankraman, khansane yaa chheenkne or logon dwaara vishaanu yukt vastuon ko chune se or phir apni naak yaa munh ko chune se failata he
 Swine flu cannot be spread by pork products, as viruses are not transmitted through food
 manushya main swine flu pehle paanch din ke dauraan zyada sankramit hote hai, haalanki kuch log, adhiktar bacchon main, yah sankraman das din ke liye bhi rah saktaa he
 For diagnosis, samples can be collected and sent for analysis within the first five days
 manushyon ke bich main is vishaanu ke prasar ko rokane ke liye influenza ke khilaaf maanak sankraman ke niyantran kaa prayog bhi kar sakate hai
 When going to public places, soap and water should be used with alcohol mixed hand-washing
 To prevent infection, all items in the house have to be disinfected, which may be possible with a thin chlorine bleach
 haalanki yah trisanyojak influenza tikaa nae 2009 H1N1 jati ke khilaaf sangrakshan pradaan karne ke liye, sakasham nahin he
 Vaccines are being developed against the new breed and they will be ready by June 2009
 visheshgyon kii raay he ki haath kii dhulaai se viral sankraman kaa rokthaam hota he, jisame saadhaaran influenza or boar flu virus bhi sammilit hai
 Influenza is spread by coughing or sneezing, but according to the evidence obtained, tiny droplets form the virus on the table, on the telephone and other surfaces and are passed through the fingers to the mouth, nose, or eyes
 madh yukt fom yaa jail se haath dhone se virus or jeevanu nasht ho jate hai

 He wrote the history of Sultans of the Nizamshahi dynasty named 'burhan-i-masir'
 is pustak ko 'tabatbai' ne tatkaaleen sultan 'burhan nizaamshaah dwitiya' ko samarpit kiya
 Agriculture is the main occupation of the surrounding areas, but food shortage is a permanent problem due to the extremely unreliable rainfall conditions
 bajra, gehun or kapaas is kshetra kii pramukh shushk fasalen hai, jabaki ganna sabase mahatvapurn sichint fasal he
 Sugar processing and cotton ginning and knotting are the main industries

 It is also a commercial center

 Became the first sugar factory in Ahmednagar
 yaha kynetic jaisi companiyon ke sanyantr hai
 Nagapur is a large industrial area in the city
 shahar main jese centre sthapit kshretra he
 The city of Ahmednagar has a very bright future in front of business and economy
 aakhirkaar, yah ek prasiddh tathy he ki shahar main aarthik vikaas ke liye atyadhik apratyaashit kshamta he
 Ahmednagar district already has the highest number of sugar cooperative factories in Maharashtra, which is the main driver of the economic development of many towns and villages, along with the city of Ahmednagar in Ahmednagar district
 yah vinirmaan or seva kshetra he ki ahmednagar aane vaale dashakon main apni aarthik vruddhi ko lekar utsukata se dekh rahe hai
 The Government of Maharashtra and the local administrators of Ahmednagar are fully aware that the development of these two areas is very important to make Ahmednagar an economically powerful player and to compensate for the low economic growth generated by the less agricultural sector
 vinirmaan paksh par, ahmednagar pehle hi ek badi pragati kar chukaa he
 The vast MIDC area located on the outskirts of Ahmednagar city is already home to over 200 industries including 42 large scale industries
 san pharmaceuticals limited, larsan and tubro limited, crompton greeves limited or kynetic ejineering jaisi prashansit bhartiya companiyaan limited emidisi kshetra main apane kaarkaanon he

 It is estimated that more than 1 lakh people of Ahmednagar city are employed in various industries located in MIDC and other areas of Ahmednagar city
 haalanki, ahmadagar kii audyogic kshetra main sabhy safalataa seva kshetra main iske kam pradarshan se kaaphi baadhit he
 In fact, apart from a few banks, finance companies and software companies Ahmednagar have nothing to show in front of the services sector

 The failure of Ahmednagar in the service sector can also be mainly due to lack of necessary skills and apathy of administration
 ahmednagar kaa krishi kshetra hameshaa laabhadaayak rahaa he
 This is due to the fact that the entire Ahmednagar district comes under dry area
 or isliye sabhi krishi bhoomi, jo mukhya rup se ahmednagar ke aas-paas ke kasbon / gaanvon main kendrit hai, aaj bhi durlabh khaadya anaaj utpaadan kaa utpaadan jari rakhte hai
 With little or no help from the agricultural sector, it is sufficient to conclude that Ahmednagar's economic fortunes are heavily dependent on decades of revival of its service sector and further development of the manufacturing sector

 thermal pradooshan kisi bhi prakaar ke pradooshan kii prakriya ko kaha jaayegaa jisase vyapak rup main pani ke prakritik taapmaana main badlaav hota ho

 Another cause of thermal pollution is caused by the reservoir pond / tank draining too much cold water into the warm rivers
 taapmaana ke aadhiky ke kaaran ghulansheel oxigen kii maatra kii kami pani main hoti he
 It is important to note that even if the temperature changes by only two degrees Celsius, it can have wide-ranging effects on the metabolism of bacteria and other cellular biologic effects

 Industrial wastes The main causes of thermal pollution by industrial sources in the United States are power plants, petroleum purifiers, pulp and paper mills, chemical plants, steel mills, and ores
 in sroton dwaara visarjeet ushni jal ko niyantrit karne main shaamil hai: Some facilities, which are done by cooling process at one time, are not able to reduce the heat of the water completely
 shahari bahaav garmiyon ke mausam main, shahari bahaavon ke chote jal sroton par mahatvapurn prabhaav pad saktaa he, kyonki pani, bahut garm ho gaye parking ke sthalon, sadakon or rahgeeron ke liye chalane vaale jagahon se hokar bahata he
 In physics and chemistry, plasma is a partially ionized gas, in which a certain proportion of electrons are independent, rather than bound to an atom or molecule

 The properties of plasma are quite opposite from those of solid, liquid or gas and are therefore considered to be a different state of matter
 plasma aamtaur par, ek tatasth-gas ke badalon kaa rup le letaa he, jaise sitaron main
 Plasma, like gas, has no fixed size or fixed volume until it is locked in a vessel, but unlike gas, under the influence of a magnetic field it forms structures such as a filament, mass, or double layer
 plasma kii pahchaan sabase pehle ek crukes nalee main 1879 me sar wiliam crukes dwaara kii gai thi unhone ise “chamakate padaarth” kaa naam diya tha
 The nature of the crux tube "cathode ray" was subsequently identified in 1897 by the British physicist Sir JJ Thomson
 1928 main irving langmuir ne ise plasma naam diya, shaayad isane unhen rakt plavika kii yaad dilaai thi

 He was born in the Baralas Turk dynasty
 uskaa pita turgai baralas turkon kaa netaa tha
 Babur was the descendant of Timur, the founder of the Mughal Empire of India
 taimur kaa janm san 1336 main trans-oxiana, trans aamu or sar nadiyon ke bich kaa pradesh, mavarounnahar, main kesh yaa shahar-e-sabj naamak sthaan main hua tha
 His father had converted to Islam

 He was a very talented and ambitious person
 mahan mongol vijeta changez khan kii tarah vah bhi samast sansar ko apni shakti se rond daalana chahta tha or sikandar kii tarah vishwavijay kii kaamana rakhata tha
 After the Mongol ruler of Samarkand died in 1369, he took over the throne of Samarkand and after that he started the work of Digvijay with full power
 changez khan kii paddati par hi usne apni sainik vyavastha kaayam kii or changez kii tarah hi usne krurta or nishthurataa ke saath dur-dur ke deshon par akraman kar unhen tahas nahas kiya
 Between 1380 and 1387, he attacked and subjugated Khorasan, Seistan, Afghanistan, Persia, Azerbaijan and Kurdistan
 1393 main usne baghdad ko lekar mesopotamia par aadhipaty sthapit kiya
 Encouraged by these victories, he now decided to attack India

 He did not even feel the need to find an excuse for the attack
 us samay dilli kii tugluk sultanate firozshah ke nirbal uttaradhikariyon ke kaaran shochaneey avasthaa main thi
 This political weakness of India gave Timur an opportunity to invade India
 1398 ke prarambh main taimur ne pehle apane ek pote pir mohammad ko bharat par akraman ke liye ravaanaa kiya
 He besieged Multan and captured it six months later
 april 1398 main taimur swayan ek baari sena lekar samarkand se bharat ke liye ravaanaa hua or sitambar main usne sindhu, jhelum tathaa raavi ko paar kiya

 yahan par usne ek lakh hindu kaidiyon ko katl karavaaya
 Nirmal Tughlaq Sultan Mahmud near Panipat fought Timur on 17 December with a huge army of 10,000 foot cavalry and 120 elephants, but was defeated badly
 bhaybheet hokar tughlaq sultan mahmud gujarat kii taraf chalaa gaya or uskaa vajeer mallu ikbaal bhagkar baran main ja chipa
 The next day Timur entered the city of Delhi
 paanch dinon tak sara shahar buree tarah se lutaa-khasota gaya or uske abhaage nivaasiyon ko bebhaav katl kiya gaya yaa bandi banaaya gaya
 The wealth of Delhi, accumulated over generations, was looted and taken to Samarkand
 anek bandi banaai gai auraton or shilpiyon ko bhi taimur apane saath le gaya
 The artisans he took with him from India built many buildings in Samarkand, the most famous of which is his self-employed Jama Masjid
 taimur bharat main keval lut ke liye aayaa tha
 He did not wish to rule in India
 at: 15 din dilli main rukne ke baad vah swadesh ke liye ravaanaa ho gaya
 On 9 January 1399 he marched on Meerut and looted the city and slaughtered the inhabitants
 iske baad vah haridwar pahunchaa jahaan usne aas paas kii hinduon kii do senaaon ko haraaya

 After his return from India, Timur invaded Anatolia in 1400 and badly defeated the Ottoman Turks in the Battle of Angora in 1402
 san 1405 main jab vah china kii vijay kii yojana banane main laga tha, uski mrityu ho gai
 Timur Lung wanted to be the second Genghis Khan
 vah changez kaa vanshaj hone kaa daawa karata tha, lekin asal main vah turk tha
 He was lame, hence called 'timur Lung'
 vah apane baap ke baad san 1369 i
 main samarkand kaa shaasha bana
 Only then did he begin his journey of conquest and cruelty
 vah bahut bada sipahsalaar tha, lekin puraa vahashi bhi tha
 The Mongols of Central Asia had become Muslims in the meantime and Timur himself was also a Muslim
 lekin musalamaanon se paala padane par vah unke saath jaraa bhi mulymit nahin baratata tha
 Wherever he reached, he spread havoc and catastrophe and complete trouble
 nar-mundon ke bade-bade dher lagavane main use khaas majaa aata tha
 From Delhi in the east to asia-kochak in the west, he killed millions of people and got their severed heads fixed in the form of stupas
 1399 i
 main taimur kaa bharat par bhayanak akraman hua
 In his biography 'tujukhe Timuri' he starts with this verse of the Quran, 'O Prophet, fight the infidels and those who do not bring faith and persecute them
 ' vah aage bharat par apane akraman kaa kaaran bataate hue likhata he- The fort of Kator was attacked on the border of Kashmir
 usne tamaam purushon ko katl or striyon or bacchon ko kaid karne kaa aadesh diya
 Then ordered to erect the towers of the heads of those obstinate Kafirs
 phir bhatner ke durg par gheraa daalaa gaya
 The Rajputs there gave up after some war and were granted pardon
 kintu unke asavadhan hote hi un par akraman kar diya gaya
 Timur writes in his biography that in a short time all the people of the fort were taken away by the sword
 ghante bhar main 10,000 logon ke sir kaate gayi
 The sword of Islam bathed in the blood of the infidels
 unke sarosaman, khajaane or anaaj ko bhi, jo varshon se durg main ikattha kiya gaya tha, mere sipaahiyon ne lut liya
 Set the houses on fire and put them to ashes
 imaaraton or durg ko bhoomisaat kar diya gaya
 The second city was Sarsuti which was attacked
 'sabhi kafir hindu katl kar diye gayi
 Their women and children and property became ours
 taimur ne jab jaaton ke pradesh main pravesh kiya
 He ordered his army to 'kill whoever gets found
 ' or phir sena ke saamne jo bhi gram yaa nagar aayaa, use lutaa gaya
 Men were slaughtered and some people, women and children were taken captive
 ' Loni was a Hindu city near Delhi
 kintu kuch musalmaan bhi bandiyon main the
 Timur ordered that all the Hindu captives, except Muslims, be taken off the sword of Islam
 is samay tak uske paas hindu bandiyon kii sankhya ek lakh ho gayi thi
 While preparing to invade Delhi after crossing the Yamuna, the rich men told him that these prisoners could not be released in the camp and freeing the enemies of Islam would also be against the rules of war
 taimur likhata he- Timur entered Delhi defeating Tughlaq emperor
 use pataa laga ki aas-paas ke dehaton se bhagkar hinduon ne badi sankhya main apane stri-bacchon tathaa moolyawaan vastuon ke saath dilli main sharan lee hui hai
 He ordered his soldiers to hold these Hindus with their property

 At the same time, the house's sister Dalbir Kaur searches for her, her husband and Sarabjit's wife, but they do not find any whereabouts, due to this, they report the missing reports but this and the police also does not pay much attention

 yah ek aisa kaanoon he jo ek vyakti ko sarkaar main do nirvaachit pad rakhane se roktaa he
 The statute was retroactively applied to Stalin's case which was widely seen as a move aimed at removing him from the post of Mayor of Chennai
 haalaanki madras ucch nyaayalay ne is kaanoon ko yah kehete hue aprabhavi qaraar diya tha ki vaidhanik nikaayon ko purvyaapee rup se logon ke "moulik adhikaron" ko prabhavit karne vaale kanoon banane se "roka" nahin gaya tha
 The court, however, held that under the Madras City Municipal Corporation Act, 1919, a person cannot be the Mayor for two consecutive terms although unlike Stalin, the earlier Mayor was not directly elected
 stallin ne sarvocch nyaayalay main apil nahin kii
 Since his first arrest in 1975, Stalin has been arrested several times on various public issues under the MISA, which is very close to the Terrorism and Hooligan Act, and has been given severe corporal punishment in the past

 haalaanki yah giraftaar 2001 main hui thi, adaalat main aarope patr chaar saal baad 2005 main daayar kiya gaya tha
 In Tamil Nadu, Stalin played an important role in campaigning in the 2009 general election and ultimately the victory of the dmk-alliance-united Progressive Alliance

 Waiko, who left the DMK, has been the most outspoken and some political observers see this as a move to shore up Vaiko as he was seen as a threat to Stalin
 haalaanki diemke ke sutron or jin logon ne 70 or 80 ke dashak kii raajnneetik uthal-puthal ko dekha he ve iskaa khandan karte hai or kehete hai ki stallin apni swayan kii yogyata ke aadhaar par aage aaye hai
