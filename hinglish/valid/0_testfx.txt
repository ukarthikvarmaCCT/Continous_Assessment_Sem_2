 Digital electronics or digital electronics is a branch of electronics in which electrical signals are numeric
 ankiy sanket bahut tarah ke ho sakate hai kintu binary digital sanket sabase adhik upyog main aate hai
 Zero / one, on / off, yes / no, low / high etc
 are some examples of binary signals
 jabase ekikrut paripathon kaa pradurbhaav hua he or ek choti si chip main lakhon karondon electronic yuktiyaan bhari jane lageen hai tab se digital electronic bahut mahatvapurn ho gayi he
 Modern personal computers and cell phones, digital cameras etc
 are the product of digital electronics
 ankiy electronic, yaa sookshmadvik aankik paddati aisi pranali he jo vidyut sanketon ko, rekhiy str ke ek nirantar pattiyon ke bajaae ek alag alag pattiyon kii shrinkhalaa ke rup main darshaati he
 All levels in this stripe indicate the same state of signals
 sanketo kii is pruthakta kii vajah se nirmaan sahansheeltaa ke kaadan rekhiy sanketo ke str main aaye apekshaakrit chote badlaav alag aavaran nahin chhodte he
 As a result, the circuit sensing the state of the signals ignores them
 zyaadaatar maamalon main sanketo kii avasthaa kii sankhya do hoti he or in do avasthaaon ko do voltage staron dwaara darshaya jaataa he: prayog main aapurti voltage ke aadhaar par ek va doosraa | 1 ucch str par hota he va 0 nimna str par
 Often these two levels are represented as "low" and "high"
 aankik takanic kaa mul laabh is tathy par aadhaarit he ki sanketo kii ek satat shrinkhalaa ko punarutpaadit karne ke bajaae, electronic upkaran ko sanketo kii 0 yaa 1 jaise kisi gyaat avasthaa main bhejnaa zyada aasaan hota he
 Digital electronics are generally made up of large combinations of logic gates and simple electronics of Boolean logic functions
 rekhiy paripath kii tulana main aankik paripath ko istemaal karne kii vajah iskaa ek laabh yah he ki shor ke kaaran sanketo kaa vighatan nahin hota he va unhen aasaani se bheja or darshaya ja saktaa he
 For example, a signal of a long sound made in the order of 1 and 0 can be reconstructed without error provided that the noise produced during the making of the signal is not so much that 1 and 0 cannot be detected
 
 sidi main ek ghante ke sangeet ko kareeb 60 lakh dwiadhari ankon ke rup main sangrahit kiya ja saktaa he
 In a digital system, more binary digits can be used to represent a more accurate signal
 haalanki is prakriya ke liye isamen adhik aankik paripath kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, chunki prayek ank ek hi prakaar ke hardware dwaara sambhala jaataa he natijatan ek aasaan maapneey tantra kaa nirmaan ho jaataa he
 An analog system requires a basic improvement in additional resolution linearity and a basic improvement in the noise characteristics of each phase of the signal chain
 computer niyantrit digital system ko software dwaara niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he jo ki hardware ko badale bina nae function ko jodne kii anumati detaa he
 And often this can be done outside the factory with the updated product software
 jisase utpaada ke dizin kii trutiyon ko graahak ke haath main utpaada ke aane ke baad sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he
 Storage of information can be done easily in digital system as compared to analog
 digital system kaa shor pratiraksha vighatan ke bina data ko sangrahit or punah praapt karne kii anumati detaa he
 In an analog system, noise from old and discarded information is stored
 ek digital pranali main jab tak kul shorgul ek nishchit str se neeche he, jaankaree ko puri tarah se punah praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In some cases digital circuits use more energy than analog circuits to do similar work and thus heat is generated
 portable yaa bydaree chaalit pranaaliyon main yah digital pranali ke upyog ko simit kar sakati he
 Battery-powered cellular telephones, for example, often use a low-power analog forearm to amplify and establish radio signals from the base station
 haalanki ek base stesan ke paas grid kii shakti hoti he or apekshit vidyut kaa prayog kar sakati he, lekin bahut lacheele software radio main
 is tarah ke base steshnon ke liye aasaani se nae cellular maanakon main prayukt sanket prakriya ko aasaani se riprogram kiya ja saktaa he
 Digital circuits are sometimes very expensive, especially in small quantities
 sanvedya jagat enlog ke hai or is jagat se sanket enlog matraaen hai
 For example light, temperature, sound, electrical conductivity, electrical and magnetic bases are analogs
 sabase upyogi digital system nirantar analog sanketon se digital sanketon ko alag karne ke liye badalanaa hoga
 This causes quantization errors
 agar system vaanchit degree kii vishwastata ke pratinidhitiv karne ke liye paryaapt digital data kaa bhandaaran karata he to parimanikaran truti ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 The Nyquist – Shannon sampling theorem provides an important directive of how much digital data is required to accurately represent a defined analog signal
 kuch pranaaliyon main yadi digital data kaa ek bhaag lupt ho jaae yaa galat tareeke se vyavahrut hon, to sambandhit data ke vishaal khandon kaa arth puri tarah se badal saktaa he
 Because of the clef effect, it is difficult for users to tell if a specific system was right on the verge of failure or whether it can tolerate too much noise before it fails
 digital bhangshiltaa ko ek digital pranali ke roopankan dwaara majbootee ke liye kam kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, a parity bit or other error handling method can be inserted into the signal path
 yah paddati system ko, truti kaa pataa lagane main madad karti he or yaa to trutiyon ko sahi karti he yaa phir kam se kam data kii ek nai pratilipi ke liye puuchhati he
 State transition logic in a state machine can be designed to hold unused state and trigger a reset sequence or other routine error recovery
 ambeded software dizin immunity aware programing kaa prayog karata he, jaise avrodh nirdesh ke saath aprayukt kaarykram smriti ke rup main bharne kaa prayaas karata he jo truti ke punah prapti kaarykram kii ore sanket detaa he
 This helps protect against failures that can cause the microcontroller instruction to spoil the indicator, which might otherwise lead to the execution of random code
 digital smriti or sanchaaran pranali truti kaa pataa lagane or sudhaar jaise takneekon kaa istemaal sanchaaran or storage main kisi bhi truti ke sudhaar ke liye atirikt data kaa prayog kar sakate hai
 On the other hand in digital systems some techniques are used to make those systems' single bit errors more vulnerable
 ye takanic tabhi sweekaarya hote hai jab antarnihit bits un trutiyon ke nahin hone kii sambhaavna se kaaphi vishwasaneey hote hai
 Digital circuits are composed of analog components
 iske dizin se sunishchit hona chahie ki analog ghatakon ke lakshan icchit digital vyavhaar par haaavee naa hon
 digital system ko shorgul or samay margin, paraseete anugam or capcitance or filter bijli conection kaa prabandhan karnaa chahie
 Poor design leads to intermittent problems such as glitches, vanishing fast pulses that may trigger some logic but not others, "runt pulses" not reaching valid threshold voltages or a combination of unexpected logic states
 jab se digital circuit analog ghatakon se bana hai digital circuit lo-prisishan se bhi dhire gananaa karata he jo ek samaan spes or shakti kaa prayog karata he
 However the digital circuit will be able to assess repeatedly due to its high noise immunity
 On the other hand, analog circuits in high precision domains need more power and digital equivalent area
 ek digital circuit kaa nirmaan aksar logic gates kahe jane vaale chote se electronic circuit se kiya jaataa he
 Each logic gate represents the processes of Boolean logic
 logic get vidyut niyantrit switch kii ek vyavastha hoti he
 The output of a logic gate is an electric current or voltage that can control and bend most logic gates
 aksar logic gates unke aakaar, bijli kii khapat or laagat ko kam karne or unki vishwasaneeyata kii vruddhi karne ke liye sabase kam sankhya main transistor kaa upyog karata he
 Integrated circuits are the least important method of making large amounts of logic gates
 aam taur par ejiniyaron dwaara electronic dizin swachaalan software kaa upyog kar ekikrut circuit kaa dizin kiya hota he 
 Another form of digital circuit consists of lookup tables
 lukup talika, mashiinon par aadhaarit logic geton kii tarah hi kaary kar sakati hai lekin aasaani se taron ko badale bina hi riprogram kar sakati hai
 This means that designers can often repair design errors without changing the wiring arrangement
 isliye choti maatra main utpaada programeble logic divaais aksar adhimaanya samaadhaan kar rahe hai
 They are typically designed by engineers using electronic design automation software
 jab sanskaran madhyam se bade hote hai or tark dhime ho sakate hai yaa jatil elgoritham yaa anukram shaamil kiye jate hai, tab aksar ambeded pranali banane ke liye ek chota-se microcontrolar ko program kiya jaataa he
 These are usually programmed by software engineers
 jab keval ek digital circuit kii aavashyaktaa ho or isaki dizin puri tarah se customiod ho, tab fectory production line controlar ke liye paaramparik samaadhaan programeble logic controlar yaa PLC he
 These are typically programmed by electricians using logic ladders
 logic kriyaaon ko kam karne ke liye ejeeniyar kai tareekon ko apanaate hai, taaki circuit kii jatilta ko kam kiya ja sake
 When complexity is low, circuit errors and electronics are also less and hence they are less expensive
 ek CAD pranali ke bheetar aspreso hiuristic logic minumaizar kii tarah ek nunatam elgorithm sabase vyapak rup se istemaal kiya gaya sarleekaran he haalanki aitihaasik rup se dwiadhari nirnay rekhachitr ek swachaalit quine-mccluskey elgorithm, truth teble, karnog maanchitr or bulian bijganit kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 Representations are important for the design of an engineer's digital circuit
 kuch vishleshan vidhiyaan keval vishesh pratinidhitiv ke saath kaam karti hai
 Representation of digital circuits with an equivalent set of logic gates is a classical method
 praayah kam se kam electronic ke saath electronic swichon ke samakaksh pranali kaa nirmaan ek doosraa tarika he 
 One of the easiest ways is to have a memory with only one table
 memory ke pate par input daale jate hai or memory ke data autput, autput ban jate hai
 These reports have digital file formats for automatic analysis that can be processed by computer programs
 adhikansh digital ejeeniyar anukool fil swaroop ke saath computer program ke chayan main saavdhaanee baratate hai
 Engineers consider the types of digital systems for reporting
 adhikansh digital system "sangyojan system" or "anukramik system" main vibhajit ho jate hai
 The input that is given in a combination system always gives the same output
 yah mul rup se logic prakriya ke set kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or jisaki charchaa pehle hi kii ja chuki he
 a sequential system is a combinatorial system with outputs inserted as inputs
 isse digital mashin opershan kaa kram se sanchaalan karata he
 The simplest sequential system is probably a flip flop, a mechanism that represents a binary digit or "bit"
 anukramik pranali ko aksar state mashin ke rup main dizin kiya jaataa he
 In this way engineers can design the aggregate behavior of a system and even test it in continuous simulation without considering the details of the logic processes without considering all the details of the logic functions
 anukramik system iske atirikt do upashreniyon main vibhajit hota he
 When a "clock" signal changes the state, the "synchronous" sequential system changes the state at once
 jab bhi input badalte hai "atulykaalik" anukramik pranali parivartan ko prasaarit karata he
 Synchronous sequential systems are characterized by asynchronous circuits such as flip flops, which make these changes only when the clock changes and in which the timing margin is carefully designed
 hameshaa kii tarah ek tulykaalik anukramik state mashin ko ek sangyojan logic main vibhajit karke lagu karne kaa vyaavhaarik tarika hota he or flip flop ke set ko "state register" kaha jaataa he
 Each time a clock gives a ticking signal and the state register captures the response generated from the previous state of the combinational logic and re-inserts it as the invariant input to the combinational part of the state machine
 sangyojan logic main samay ke khapat vaale adhikansh logic akalan dwaara ghadi kii sabase tej dar set hoti he
 The state register represents just one binary number
 agar state mashin main state bahut zyada hai to logic prakriya kuch sangyojan logic hote hai jo kai sankhya main state kaa utpaadan karti hai
 In comparison, the design of asynchronous systems is very difficult because the possible state must be considered at all possible times
 nunatam or adhiktam samay ke teble ke nirmaan ke sabase saamaanya vidhi ke anusaar isamen saare state vidyaman ho or vaise state ke minimise ke liye circuit ko samyojit kiya jaataa he or jo iske sabhi hisson ke susangat state main samay-samay par jane ke liye circuit ko baadhya kare
 aise saavdhaan dizin ke bina sanyogvash atulykaalik logic kaa utpaadan karnaa aasaan he jo "asthir" he or vaastavik electronics he jisamen apratyaashit parinaam hote hai kyonki electronic upkarnon ke mulyon main chote badlaavon kii vajah se sanchit vilamb hota he
 Some circuits are inherently asynchronous in their design and should be analyzed as such
 2005 ke rup main lagbhag sabhi digital mashine tulykaalik dizin hote hai kyonki tulykaalik dizin ko bananaa or satyapit karnaa bahut aasaan he-vartmaan main digital mashiinon kii nakal karne vaale softver, atulykaalik dizin ko nahin sambhalate
 tathaapi, atulykaalik tark ko behatar samajha jaataa he, yadi usase kaam nikaala ja sake to, kyonki uski gati ghadi dwaara manamaane dhang se gati simit nahin he, bajaay, yah un logic geton dwaara anumat gati par saamaanya rup se chalati he, jinase inkaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 Constructing an asynchronous circuit using fast parts indirectly "runs" the circuit faster
 aam taur par, kai digital system, data pravaah mashine hai
 Often they are designed using synchronous register transfer logic and have been used as VHDL or Verilog hardware description languages
 register hastantaran logic main dwiadhari sankhya flip flop ke samoohon main sangrahit hai jise register kaha jaataa tha
 The output of each register is a bundle of wires called a "bus" that passes that number for other estimation
 yah akalan keval sangyojan logic kaa ek bhaag he
 Each estimation has a bus output and can be connected to multiple input registers
 kabhi-kabhi ek register ke paas inke input par bahusanketak hota he jisase yah kai bason main se kisi ek se nambar ko store kar saktaa he
 Alternatively the output of several things can be connected via buffers which can turn off the output of all devices except one
 input se prayek register ke naye data ko sweekaar karne par anukramik state mashin niyantran karata he
 In the 1980s some researchers found that almost all synchronous register-transfer machines could be converted to asynchronous designs using first-in-first-out synchronization logic
 is yojana main digital mashin, ek data pravaah ke ek set ke rup main pahachaani jaati he
 At each step of the flow, an asynchronous "synchronization circuit" determines when the output of that step is solid and gives a presented signal to "hold the data" to the stages in which the inputs to those stages are used
 iske liye kuch apekshaakrit saral tulykaalan circuit kii aavashyaktaa he
 The most general-purpose transfer-logic machine is a computer
 yah multah ek swat: binary abekas he
 The control unit of a computer is typically designed as a micro program run by a microsensor
 yah micro program ek player-piano role kii tarah hoti he
 Each table commands every bit of entry or "word" state of the micro program that controls the computer
 anukramak phir use ginati karata he or memory yaa sangyojan logic mashin main yah ginati sambodhit karata he jisamen micro program samahit hota he
 The bits from the microprogram control the arithmetic logic unit, memory and other parts of the computer, and the microservices itself
 is tarah computer ke niyantran kii digining ke jatil kaary ko apekshaakrit kaaphi saral logic mashiinon ke sangrah ke saral kaaryon main parivartit kar diya gaya
 Computer architecture is a specialized engineering activity that tries to classify registers, assessment logic, buses, and other parts of a computer in some way for the best purpose
 computer vaastukar ne laagat kam karne or gati ko teevr karne or computer programing trutiyon kii pratiraksha ke liye computer ke dizin main vrihad maatra main suprayog ko lagaaya he
 And its simple purpose is to reduce power in a fast battery powered computer system
 kai computer architech microprogrammers ke rup main vistrut prashikshuta kii seva de rahe hai
 "typical computers" are typically a traditional computer with a special purpose micro program
 mahange ejineering prayaason se bachane ke liye, badi logic mashiinon ke dizine banane ke prayaas kaaphi kuch swachaalit kar die gaye hai
 Computer programs are called "electronic design automation devices" or simply "EDA"
 logic kaa, saral truth teble-style kaa vivaran, aksar EDA ke saath ishtatam kiya jaataa he jo logic get kii ghatit pranaaliyon ko swatah utpaadit karata he yaa chote lukup teble ko, jo abhi bhi vaanchit parinaam dete hai
 The most common example of this type of software is the espresso heuristic logic minimizer
 vishaal logic pranaliyon ke anukulan ke liye adhikansh vyaavhaarik elgoridam, bijiy jodtod yaa dwiadhari nirnay aarekh kaa upyog karte hai or anuvanshik kalan vidhi or tapiya anukulan ke saath prayog, sambhaavna se bhare hai
 To automate costly engineering processes, some edas can take state tables that describe a state machine and can produce a truth table or a function table for a mixed part of a state machine
 state teble paath kaa ek tukdaa he jo prayek state ko paristhitiyon ke saath soochibaddh karata he, jo unke or sambandhit utpaadan sanketon ke bich sankraman ko niyantrit karata he
 It is common for function tables of such computer generated state machines to be optimized with the logic minimization software Minelog
 aksar, vaastavik logic pranaliyaan, up-pariyojnaon kii ek shrinkhalaa ke rup main dizin kii gai hoti hai, jinhen ek "upkaran pravaah" ke upyog se sanyojit kiya jaataa he
 The tool flow is usually a "script", a simple computer language that can implement software design tools in the correct order
 bade logic system ke liye upkaran pravaah, jaise microprocesar, hajaaron cmand lambey ho sakate hai or saikadon ejiniyaron ke kaam ko sanyojit karte hai
 Writing and debugging equipment flow is an established engineering specialty in companies producing digital design
 upkaran pravaah aam taur par ek vistrut computer fil yaa filon ke set main mit jaataa he jo yah varnan karata he ki kaise logic kaa bhautik rup se nirmaan karen
 This often includes transistor and wire drawing instructions on an integrated circuit or printed circuit board
 upkaran pravaah ke hisson ko, apekshit input ke khilaaf nakli logic ke output kii pushti karne ke dwaara dibag kiya jaataa he
 Testing equipment takes computer files with a set of inputs and outputs and highlights discrepancies between simulated behavior and expected behavior
 ek baar input data ko sahi maanane ke baad, khud dizine ko abhi bhi shuddhta ke liye satyapit kiya janaa chahie
 Some instrument flows confirm the design first by producing a design and then scanning the design to produce input data relevant to the instrument flow
 yadi scan kiya hua data, input data ke saath mail khaataa he, to upkaran pravaah ne shaayad koi trutiyaan pesh nahin kii
 Functional validation data, usually called "test vectors"
 kaaryaatmak pareekshan vector ko sangrakshit kiya ja saktaa he or kaarkaane main yah pareekshan karne ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he ki navnirmit logic sahi dhang se kaam karata he yaa nahin
 Functional test patterns, however, do not discover common construction mistakes
 Production tests, often designed by software tools, are called "test pattern generators"
 logic kii sanrachana kii jaanch or vyavasthit dhang se vishesh dosha ke liye test janit kar, ye pareekshan vector ko utpann karte hai
 In this way fault coverage can reach around 100%, provided the design is properly testable
 ek baar koi dizine maujuud he or satyapit or pareekshan yogya he, to ise utpaadit yogya hone ke liye aksar sansaadhit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In modern integrated circuits, the wavelength of light used to illuminate photoresistance has smaller characteristics
 utpaadakta software, expozar mask main mukt-paripath ko samaapt karne ke liye hastkshep pattern jodate hai or mask ke rizolution or contrast main vruddhi karte hai
 a large logic machine can have an astronomical number of possible states
 jaahir he, kaarkaane main, har state kaa pareekshan avyaavhaarik he agar har state ke pareekshan main ek microsecond lagata he or brahmad ke shuru hone se hi microsecond kii sankhya se kahin adhik state hai
 Unfortunately, this ridiculous case is typical
 saubhaahgya se, badi logic mashiinon ko lagbhag hameshaa chote logic mashiinon ke sangyojan ke rup main taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 To save time, small sub-machines are isolated by permanently installed "design for Test" circuitry and tested independently
 "scan dizin" naam kii ek aam pareekshan yojana, test bits ko kramik rup se ek yaa ek se adhik "scan chen" naam ke kramik shift register ke madhyam se hataati he
 In sequential scans, there are only one or two wires to carry the data and reduce the physical size and expenses of the frequently used test logic
 saare pareekshan ke baad, data bits jagah par hai, dizine ko "saamaanya mod" ke liye rikanfigure kiya jaataa he or ek yaa ek se adhik clock pulse ko lagu kiya jaataa hai, taaki dosha kaa pataa lag sake or pareekshan ke parinaam kaa pragrahan scan shift register main flip-flop main or / yaa leches main kiya jaataa he
 Finally, the test result is shifted to the block boundary and the forecast is compared against the "good machine" result
 ek board test paryaavaran main samanaantar testing ke kram ko, ek maanak "JTAG" ke saath aupchaarik rup diya gaya he 
 Another common test scheme provides a test mode that forces parts of the logic machine to enter a "probe cycle"

 The practicality of a system of digital logic determines many things
 fainout, gati, kam laagat or vishwasaneeyata kaa ek adarsh sangyojan praapt karne ke liye, ejiniyaron ne kai electronic upkarnon kaa nirikshan kiya
 The cost of a logic gate is significant
 1930 ke dashak main, praarambhik digital logic system, telephone riley se banaae jate the kyonki ye saste or apekshaakrit vishwasaneey the
 After that, engineers always used the cheapest available electronic switch, which could still meet the requirements

 With the increase of integrated circuits, reducing the absolute number of chips used introduced another way of saving costs
 ek diziner kaa lakshya sirf aasaan circuit bananaa nahin he, balki ghatak kii ginati kam rakhana he
 Sometimes this results in a slightly more complex design with respect to the underlying digital logic, but still reduces the number of components, board size, and even power consumption

 He was scheduled to retire in 1995
 vah bhartiya sena kaa ekmaatr adhyaksh hai jo apane kaarykaal main main mrityu ko praapt hue 
 In his honor, General BC Joshi Army Public School was established in 1993 in Pithoragarh, Uttarakhand
 zabt yaa zabti madhyakaal main bharat main bhoomi rajasav ke nirdhaaran kii ek paddati jo maap par aadhaarit thi
 It was prevalent in India at the time of the Suras and the Mughals
 saadhaanat: zabt, parantu kabhi-kabhi zabti tathaa jareeb yaa 'amal-e-jareeb' kehalaati thi
 According to Abul Fazl, Sur Raja Sher Shah and Islam Shah were the promoters of this method
 isaki jo pramukh visheshta thi, anya paddatiyon se bhinn, jo maap par aadhaarit thi arthath 'kanakut' prati bigha fasalon kii dar purv se hi nirdhaarit ho jaati thi na ki fasal kii kataai ke samay
 The actual land was 1 / 3 of the rate of revenue, and this rule was applied to revenue received on measured land
 vah rajasav pehle jins main hi liya jaataa tha, taduparant tatkaaleen mulyon ke aadhaar par nakad main parivartit kar diya jaataa tha
 Change was indeed a source of corruption and inefficiency
 astu, akbar ne bhoomi rajasav ko nakad main hi nirdhaarit karaayaa
 After a detailed inspection of the yield and prevailing price rates of the then ten years, the cash land revenue per bigha was determined in each region for different crops
 zabt main bhoomi rajasav, boi hui araaji dastur se guna karke nakad nirdhaarit hota tha
 The rituals, which used to change from time to time, often applied without looking at rates of yield and prices per year
 daivi vipatti padane par maang main katautee, bina dastur main parivartan ke aapattigrast kshetra ko araaji main se ghataakar kiya jaataa tha
 It seems that in reality, the land was not metered every year, but only by voluntarily changing the numbers of earlier years
 paimaaish keval tabhi hoti thi jab kisaan athwa adhikari pehle kii paimaaish se santusht na ho, agar vah vartmaan upaj par aadhaarit na rahi ho 
 Sher Shah implemented the confiscation system throughout his empire except Multan and perhaps Bengal
 akbar ke adheen jabt kshetra kaa or adhik vikaas hua, yadhyapi isamen sandeh he ki dilli or praanton ke baahar vistrut khetihar bhoomi kii naap tathaa nirdhaaran hua ho
 The seizure method did not decline in the 17th century, contrary to Moreland's ideology
 vastav main, iskaa murshid kuli khan ke dwaara dakshin ke mughal praanton main adhik vistaar hua tha
 In the provinces of northern India also, the area of measurement extended under Aurangzeb, much more than the area written in Ain Akbari
 mughal samrajya ke patan ke saath yah paddati, jisko kendrit shashan ke liye badhaava diya gaya tha, yaa to tyaag di gai yaa parivartit kar di gai
 But till some time ago, in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh there was a practice of 'confiscation rent', which was collected in cash on the basis of Araji on some crops
 thailacin aadhunik yug kaa sabase bada gyaat maansaahaari dhaniprani tha
 It is also called Tasmanian Lion due to the stripes on its back
 kuch log is tasmanian bhediya bhi bulaate hai
 It was native to the mainland of Australia, the island of Tasmania and New Guinea but is believed to have become extinct in the 20th century
 yah apane 'thailecnidaaye' naamak jeevvaigyanik kul kii aakhri jivit jati thi kyonki anya sabhi jatiyaan madhyanutan yug, yani aaj se 50 lakh varsh purv, ke ant tak pehle hi vilupt ho chuki thim
 By the time Europeans settled in the Australian mainland in the 18th and 19th centuries, Thylacine was either extinct there or on the verge of extinction
 lekin mukhyabhumi se hatakar tasmania ke dweep par yah tasmenian devil jaise anya jatiyon kii tarah jivit tha
 When the European people camped there too, government rewards were given for killing it
 dhire-dhire yah khatm hone laga
 In 1936, the last known Thylacine died in the Zoo of Hobart, the capital of Tasmania, and the species became extinct
 isaki vilupti ke kai kaaran bataaye jate hai jinamein maanvon dwaara shikaar, bimaari kaa failana, tasmania main kutton kaa aa janaa or thailacin ke junglee nivas sthanon main insaanon kaa aa dhamkna shaamil hai
 After much investigation in January 2013, scientists attributed human activities to its extinction

 ankiy electronic yaa digital electronics electronics kii ek shakha he jisamen vidyut sanket ankiy hote hai
 Digital signals can be of many types, but binary digital signals are most commonly used
 shunya / ek, on / of, haan / nahin, lo / hai aadi binary sanketon ke kuch udhaaharan hai
 Digital electronic has become very important ever since integrated circuits have emerged and millions of electronic devices are being loaded into a small chip
 aadhunik vyaktigat computer tathaa cell-phone, digital camera aadi digital electronic kii dein hai
 Numerical electronics, or microtubule numerical method, is a system that represents electrical signals as a series of separate strips, rather than as a continuous band of linear levels
 is pattee ke sabhi str sanketon kii ek hi avasthaa ko darshaate hai
 Because of this separation of signs, relatively small changes in the level of linear signal due to the construction tolerance do not leave a separate cover
 jiske parinaam swarup sanketo kii avasthaa ko mahasoos karne vaala paripath inhe nazarandaaj kar detaa he
 In most cases the number of signal states is two and these two states are represented by two voltage levels: one and the other depending on the supply voltage in use
 1 is at high level and 0 is at low level
 aksar ye donon str "lo" or "hai" ke rup main pratinidhitiv karte hai
 The basic advantage of the numerical technique is based on the fact that instead of reproducing a continuous series of signals, it is easier to send the electronic device to a known state of signals such as 0 or 1
 digital electronics aam taur par logic gates ke vrihad sangyojan va bulian tark prakaarya ke saral electronix se banaaya jaataa he
 One of the advantages of using a numerical circuit compared to a linear circuit is that signals are not disrupted due to noise and can be easily sent and displayed
 udhaaharan ke liye, 1 or 0 ke kram main banaaye huye lambe aawaaj ke ek sanket ko truti ke bina punahnirmaan kiya ja saktaa he basharte sanket banane ke dauraan paidaa hua shor itnaa na ho kii uski vajah se 1 va 0 ko pahachaanaa hi na ja sake
 One hour of music in a CD can be stored as about 60 million binary digits
 ek digital pranali main, ek adhik sateek sanket ke pratinidhitiv ke liye adhik binary ankon kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 However, this process requires more numerical circuits, since each digit is handled by the same type of hardware as a result, creating an easier scalable system
 ek analog system main atirikt rezlushan raikhiktaa main buniyadi sudhaar or sanket shrinkhalaa ke prayek charan ke shor ke abhilakshan main buniyadi sudhaar kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Computer controlled digital systems can be controlled by software that allows the addition of new functions without changing the hardware
 or aksar ise adhyatan utpaada ke software ke dwaara kaarkaane ke baahar kiya ja saktaa he
 Whereby product design errors can be rectified after the product arrives in the customer's hands
 soochna kaa bhandaaran analog kii tulana main digital pranali main aasaani se kar sakate hai
 The noise immunity of digital systems allows data to be stored and retrieved without disruption
 ek analog system main, puraane or chhijan se shor sangruhit soochna ko nasht karata he
 In a digital system, as long as the total noise is below a certain level, the information can be completely retrieved
 kuch maamalon main digital circuit, ek jaise kaam karne ke liye enlog circuit se zyada urja kaa upyog karti he or is tarah taap utpann hota he
 In portable or battery-powered systems it may limit the use of digital systems
 udhaaharan ke liye bydaree sanchalit celular telephone aksar ek kam shakti ke analog agrasira ke istemaal se base stesan se radio signal badhaane or sangati bithaane ke liye karti he
 Although a base station has grid power and can use the required power, a very flexible software radio
 The signaling process used in such new cellular standards can be easily reprogrammed for such base stations
 digital circuit kabhi-kabhi bahut mahange hote he khaskar choti maatra main
 The senses belong to the world analog and the analog analog quantities from this world
 udhaaharan ke liye prakaash, taapmaana, dhwani, vidyut chaalakata, vidyut or chumbakeey aadhaar analog hai
 The most useful digital systems would be to continuously alter digital signals from analog signals
 yah parimanikaran trutiyon kaa kaaran banataa he
 The quantization error can be reduced if the system stores enough digital data to represent the desired degree of fidelity
 ek nirdhaarit analog sanket ko thik-thik prastut karne ke liye kitni digital data kii aavashyaktaa hoti he uski jaankaree niquist-shannon namoona prameya ek mahatvapurn nirdesh pradaan karata he
 In some systems, if a piece of digital data is lost or misappropriated, the vast amounts of related data can change its meaning completely
 kyonki clif effect ke kaaran, upyogkartaaon ke liye bataanaa mushkil he ki koi vishisht system vifaltaa ke kagaar par sahi tha yaa phir vah asafal hone se pehle bahut adhik shor ko sahan kar saktaa he yaa nahin
 Digital vulnerability can be reduced for robustness by designing a digital system
 udhaaharan ke liye ek parity bit yaa anya truti prabandhan paddati ko signal path main daalaa ja saktaa he
 This method helps the system detect errors and either correct the errors or at least ask for a new copy of the data
 ek state mashin main state transishan logic kaa aprayukt state ko pakadaney or ek riset anukram trigar yaa anya niyamit truti vasuuli ke liye dizin kiya ja saktaa he
 Embedded software design uses immunity aware programming, such as attempting to fill unused program memory with blocking instructions that point to an error recovery program
 is vifaltaa ke khilaaf raksha main madad karata he jo micro controlar anudesh suchak ko bigaad sakate hai, jo anyathaa yadrichhik code ke nishpadit kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 Technologies such as digital memory and transmission system error detection and correction can use additional data to correct any errors in transmission and storage
 duusari ore digital pranali main kuch takneekon kaa istemaal un pranaaliyon ke ekal bit trutiyon ko adhik kamjor banane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 These techniques are acceptable only when the underlying bits are significantly more reliable than those errors are unlikely to occur
 digital circuit analog ghatakon se bana hai
 Its design should ensure that the characteristics of analog components do not dominate the intended digital behavior
 Digital systems must manage noise and time margins, parasitic routing and capacitance, and filter power connections
 kharaab dizin main aantrayik samasya hoti he jaise gliches, gaayab hoti tej pulces jo ki dusron ko nahin lekin kuch logic ko gati pradaan kar sakate hai, "rant pulse" maanya seemaa voltage tak nahin pahunch pate hai yaa anpekshit logic stats kaa sangyojan hote hai
 Since digital circuits are composed of analog components, the digital circuit calculates slower than low-precision, which uses the same space and power
 haalanki digital circuit iske ucch shor unmukti ke kaaran baar-baar akalan kar paaegaa
 duusari ore, ucch parishuddhta domen main analog circuit ko adhik shakti or digital samakaksh kshetra kii aavashyaktaa he
 a digital circuit is often constructed from a small electronic circuit called logic gates
 prayek logic get boolian logic ke prakriyaayon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 a logic gate is an arrangement of electrically controlled switches
 ek logic get kaa output ek vidyut pravaah yaa voltage hota he jo adhikansh logic gates par niyantran or use mode saktaa he
 Often logic gates use the lowest number of transistors to reduce their size, power consumption and cost, and increase their reliability
 badi maatra main logic gates banane kaa ekikrut circuit kam se kam mahatvapurn tarika he
 Integrated circuits are typically designed by engineers using electronic design automation software
 digital circuit kaa doosraa rup lukup teble se nirmit hota he 
 Lookup tables can function like logic gates based on machines but can be easily reprogrammed without changing the strings
 iskaa arth yah he ki diziner, aksar taron kii vyavastha ko badale bina hi dizin trutiyon kii marammat kar sakate hai
 Therefore small amounts of product programmable logic devices are often the preferred solution
 ve aam taur par ejiniyaron dwaara electronic dizin swachaalan software kaa upyog kar dizin kiya jaataa he 
 When versions are medium to large and logic can be slow or complex algorithms or sequences are included, a small microcontroller is often programmed to create embedded systems
 ye aam taur par software ejiniyaron dwaara program kiye hote hai
 When only a digital circuit is required and its design is completely customized, the traditional solution for a factory production line controller is a programmable logic controller or PLC
 ye aam taur par electrician dwaara logic leader kaa upyog karte hue program kiye gaye hai
 Engineers adopt several methods to reduce logic functions, so as to reduce the complexity of the circuit
 jab jatilta kam hoti he tab circuit main trutiyaan or electronics bhi kam hoti hai or isliye ye kam mahange hote hai
 a minimization algorithm like the espresso heuristic logic minimizer is the most widely used simplification within a CAD system although historically binary decision diagrams have used an automated quine-mccluskey algorithm, truth tables, kernog maps, and Boolean algebra
 
 ejeeniyar ke digital circuit ke dizin ke liye pratinidhitiv mahatvapurn hai
 Some analysis methods only work with special representation
 logic geton ke samakaksh set ke saath digital circuit kaa pratinidhitiv shastreey tarika he
 Another approach is to construct a system often equivalent to electronic switches with minimal electronic
 sirf ek truth teble se yukt smriti aasaan tareekon main se ek hota he
 Inputs are inserted at the memory address and the data outputs of the memory become outputs
 swachaalit vishleshan ke liye in prativednon ke paas digital fil swaroop hote hai jise computer program dwaara process kiya ja saktaa he
 Most digital engineers are careful in selecting computer programs with a compatible file format
 prativedan ke liye ejeeniyar digital system ke prakaaron par vichaar karte hai
 Most digital systems are divided into "combinatorial systems" and "sequential systems"
 sangyojan pranali main hameshaa jo input diya jaataa he vahi output vah detaa he
 It basically represents the set of logic processes and which has already been discussed
 anukramik pranali input ke rup main daale gaye output ke saath ek sangyojan pranali he
 This allows the digital machine to operate operationally
 sabase saral anukramik pranali shaayad ek flip flop he, ek yantrawali jo ki ek binary ank yaa "bit" kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Sequential systems are often designed as state machines
 is tareeke se ejeeniyar ek system ke sakal vyavhaar ko dizin kar sakate hai or yahaan tak ki logic prakriyaayon ke vivaran par vichaar kiye bina satat anukaran main bhi iskaa pareekshan kar sakate hai, bina tark kaaryon ke sabhi vivaran par vichaar kiye
 The sequential system is further divided into two subcategories
 jab ek "clock" signal state ko parivartit karata he tab "tulykaalik" anukramik pranali ek hi baar main state ko badal detaa he
 "asynchronous" transmits a sequential system change whenever inputs change
 tulykaalik anukramik system atulykaalik circuit kii visheshta se bana hota he jaise flip flop, jo clock jab parivartan karata he tabhi ye parivartan karata he or jisamen timming margin ko dhyaan se dizin kiya jaataa he
 As usual, a synchronous sequential state machine is a practical way to implement by dividing it into a combinational logic and a set of flip flops called a "state register"
 har baar ek ghadi tik tik kii signal detii he or state register sangyojan logic ke pichley state se utpann pratikriya par kabja kar leti he or state mashin ke sangyojan bhaag main aparivertineeya input ke rup main phir se ise daal detii he
 In combination logic, the fastest clock rate is set by most of the time-consuming logic estimations
 state register sirf ek dwiadhari sankhya kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 If there are too many states in the state machine, the logic process is some combination logic that produces a number of states
 isaki tulana main atulykaalik system kaa dizin bahut kathin hota he kyonki sabhi sambhav samay main bhi sambhavit state kaa vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 According to the most common method of constructing the minimum and maximum time tables, the state is present in it and the circuit is adjusted to minimize the state and to make the circuit go periodically to the corresponding state of all its parts
 Force it
 Without such careful design, it is easy to produce coincidentally asynchronous logic that is "unstable" and is real electronics that has unpredictable consequences because of small changes in the value of electronic devices due to accumulated delays
 kuch circuit sahaj rup se apane dizin main antarnihit atulykaalik rahe hai or is tarah hi vishleshan kiya janaa chahie
 As of 2005 almost all digital machines are synchronous design because synchronous design is very easy to create and verify - currently the software that mimics digital machines does not handle asynchronous design
 However, asynchronous logic is better understood if it can be worked out, because its speed is not arbitrarily limited by the clock speed, instead, it operates normally at the speed allowed by the logic gates from which they are constructed
 has been done
 tej bhaagon ke upyog dwaara ek atulykaalik circuit nirmaan, apratyaksh rup se circuit ko tezi se "daudati" he
 Generally, many digital systems are data flow machines
 aksar inhen tulykaalik register hastantaran logic kaa upyog kar dizin kiya jaataa he or isamen VHDL yaa verilog hardware varnan bhashaaon ke rup main prayog kiya gaya he
 In register transfer logic, binary numbers are stored in groups of flip flops called registers
 prayek register kaa output taron kaa bandal he jise ek "bas" kaha jaataa he jo anya akalan ke liye us nambar ko paas rakhata he
 This assessment is only a part of combination logic
 prayek akalan ke paas ek bas output hota he or ye kai input registeron se judaa ho saktaa he
 Sometimes a register has a multiplexer on its input so that it can store numbers from any one of several buses
 vaikalpik rup se kai chizon ke output ko baphers ke madhyam se joda ja saktaa he jo ek ko chhodkar sabhi upkarnon ke output ko band kar saktaa he
 The sequential state machine controls when new data from each register is accepted from the input
 1980 ke dashak main kuch shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki lagbhag sabhi tulykaalik register-transfar mashiinon ko first-in-first-out tulykaalan logic kaa upyog karke atulykaalik diginon main parivartit kiya ja saktaa tha
 The digital machine, in this scheme, is identified as a set of data flows
 pravaah ke har kadam main, ek atulykaalik "tulykaalan circuit" nirdhaarit karata he jab us step kaa output thos or ek prastut sanket detaa he ki un stejon ko "data ko pakado" jisamen un stejon ke input main prayog hua he
 This requires some relatively simple synchronization circuits
 sabase saamaanya-uddeshy transfar-logic mashin ek computer he
 It is basically an automatic binary abacus
 aam taur par computer kii niyantran ikai kaa dizin ek micro program ke rup main kiya gaya he jise ek microsikvencer dwaara chalaaya jaataa he
 This micro program is like a player-piano roll
 har talika pravishti yaa sookshm program ke "shabd" state ke har bit ko cmand detii he jo ki computer par niyantran karti he
 The sequencer then counts it and addresses this count in a memory or combinational logic machine that contains the micro-program
 microprogram se bits ankaganitiya logic ikai, memory or computer ke anya bhaagon or swayan microsicyonsar par niyantran karata he
 In this way, the complex task of designing computer control was transformed into a relatively simple collection of logic machines
 computer architekchar ek vishesh ejineering gatividhi he jo register, akalan logic, bason or computer ke anya bhaagon ko kuch prayojan ke liye sabase achche tareekon se shreneebaddh karne kii koshish karata he

 Many computers are serving detailed apprenticeships as Architech microprogrammers
 "vishisht computer" aam taur par ek vishesh uddeshy ke sookshm program ke saath ek paaramparik computer hai
 To avoid costly engineering efforts, efforts to design large logic machines have been heavily automated
 computer program ko "electronic dizine swachaalan upkaran" yaa bas "EDA" kaha jaataa he
 a simple Truth table-style description of logic, often optimized with EDA that automatically generates reduced systems of logic gates or smaller lookup tables that still give the desired results
 is prakaar ke software kaa sabase saamaanya udhaaharan aspreso huristic logic minimiser he
 Most practical algorithms for optimizing large logic systems, using algebraic manipulations or binary decision diagrams and experiments with genetic algorithms and thermal optimization, are full of possibilities
 mahangi ejineering prakriyaaon ko swachaalit karne ke liye, kuch EDA state teble le sakate hai jo state mashin kaa varnan karte hai or ek state mashin ke mishrit bhaag ke liye ek truth teble yaa ek function teble kaa utpaadan kar sakate hai
 The state table is a piece of text that lists each state with conditions, which control the transition between them and the corresponding output signals
 yah aise computer utpann state mashiinon ke function teble ke liye aam he ki unhen logic minimiraseshan software minilog ke saath anukulit kiya jaae
 Often, real logic systems are designed as a series of sub-projects, which are combined using an "instrument flow"
 upkaran pravaah, aam taur par ek "script" hoti he, ek saral computer bhashaa jo sahi kram main software dizin upkarnon ko lagu kar sakati he
 Equipment flow for large logic systems, such as microprocessors, can be thousands of commands long and combine the work of hundreds of engineers
 upkaran pravaah kaa lekhan or dibging, digital dizin kaa utpaadan karne vaali companiyon main ek sthapit ejineering visheshta he
 The tool flow is usually erased into a detailed computer file or set of files that describes how to physically construct the logic
 isamen aksar ek ekikrut paripath yaa mudrit circuit board par transistor or taar khinchne ke nirdesh shaamil hote hai
 Parts of the instrument flow are debugged by verifying the output of the simulated logic against the expected input
 pareekshan upkaran, input or output ke set ke saath computer filon ko lete hai or nakli vyavhaar or apekshit vyavhaar ke bich visangatiyon par prakaash daalate hai
 Once the input data is considered correct, the design itself must still be verified for correctness
 kuch upkaran pravaah, pehle ek dizine ke utpaadan dwaara dizin kii pushti karte hai or phir upkaran pravaah ke liye sangat input data ke utpaadan ke liye dizin kii scanning karte hai
 If the scanned data coincides with the input data, the instrument flow probably introduced no errors
 kaaryaatmak satyaapan data, aam taur par "pareekshan vector" kehalaate hai
 The functional test vector can be preserved and used in the factory to test whether the newly constructed logic works correctly
 haalanki, kaaryaatmak pareekshan pattern, aam nirmaan galatiyon kii khoj nahin karte

 These tests generate the vector, by examining the structure of logic and systematically generating tests for specific faults
 is tarah folt kawarej kareeb 100% tak pahunch saktaa he, basharte dizine ko thik tarah se pareekshan yogya banaaya gaya ho 
 Once a design exists and is verified and testable, it often needs to be processed to be product qualified
 aadhunik ekikrut paripath main, photopratirodh ko ujagar karne ke liye prayukt prakaash kii tarang dairdhya se choti visheshtaayen hai
 Productivity software adds interference patterns to expose free-circuits in the exposure mask and increases the resolution and contrast of the mask
 ek badi logic mashin main sambhav state kii ek khagoleey sankhya ho sakati he
 Apparently, in the factory, testing every state is impractical if testing every state takes one microsecond and there are more states than the number of microseconds since the universe began
 durbhaagya se, yah haasyaaspad lagane vaala maamla vishisht he
 Fortunately, large logic machines are almost always produced in conjunction with small logic machines
 samay bachaane ke liye, chote up mashiinon ko, sthaayee rup se sthapit "dizine for test" circuitary dwaara pruthak kiya jaataa he or swatantra rup se jaanch kii jaati he
 a common test scheme, called "scan design", removes test bits sequentially through a sequential shift register named one or more "scan chains" 
 kramik scan main, data le jane or baar-baar istemaal naa hone vaale test logic ke bhautik aakaar or kharche ko kam karne ke liye keval ek yaa do taar hote hai
 After all testing, the data bits are in place, the design is reconfigured to "normal mode" and one or more clock pulse is applied, so that faults can be detected and the scan results are captured
 Shift is done in flip-flops in the register and / or in laches
 ant main, pareekshan ke parinaam ko block seemaa main sthanantarit kar diya jaataa he or purvanumaan "good mashin" nattejey ke prati tulana kii jaati he

 To achieve an ideal combination of fanout, speed, low cost, and reliability, engineers inspected several electronic devices
 ek logic get kii laagat mahatvapurn hoti he
 In the 1930s, early digital logic systems were made from telephone relays because they were cheap and relatively reliable
 uske baad, ejiniyaron ne hameshaa sabase sasta uplabdh electronic switch upyog kiya, jo abhi bhi aavashyaktaaon ko puraa kar saktaa he
 The early integrated circuits were a joyous coincidence

 For example, in some logic families, NAND gates are the simplest digital gates to be built
 anya sabhi logic vaali karrwai NAND get dwaara karyanvit kii ja sakati hai
 If a circuit already requires one NAND gate and a single chip typically holds four NAND gates, the rest of the gate can be used to implement other logic operations such as logical end

 Modern transistor integrated circuit logic gates have approximately one trillion-hour mtbfs), and they are needed because they have a lot of logic gates
 fainout yah varnan karata he ki ek ekal logic output se kitne logic input niyantrit kiye ja sakate hai
 The minimum practical fanout is around five
 aadhunik electronic logic jo switch ke liye CMOS transistor kaa upyog karte hai, unke paas kareeb pachaas ke aas-paas fainout hote hai or kabhi-kabhi bahut oonche ja sakate hai
 "switching speed" refers to how many times an inverter can change from true to false and back
 tej logic kam samay main adhik kaary ko puraa kar sakate hai
 Digital logic became useful for the first time when the switching speed was above fifty Hz, because it was faster than a team of humans operating mechanical calculators
 aadhunik electronic digital logic niyamit rup se paanch gigahertz par parivartit hote hai or kuch prayogshaala pranali ek terrahertz se adhik par parivartit hoti he
 Design started with Riley
 Relay logic was relatively cheap and reliable but slow
 kabhi-kabhi ek yantric vifaltaa bhi ghatit hoti thi
 Fanouts were typically ten, limited by the resistance of the coils and forming an arc upon contact with high voltage
 baad main, nirvaat tub kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 They were very fast, but produced heat and were unreliable due to the burning of the filaments
 fainout aam taur par paanch se saat the, jo tub ke vidyut se heating dwaara simit the
 In the 1950s, special "computer tubes" were developed with filaments that removed volatile elements like silicon
 ye kai hajaaron ghante tak chalate hai
 The first semiconductor logic family was resistor-transistor logic
 yah tub se hazaar guna adhik vishwasaneey tha, aaraam se chalata tha or kam bijli istemaal karata tha, lekin teenon main se bahut nune fain-in tha
 Diode-transistor logic improved fanout to seven and decreased power
 kuch DTL diginon ne fainout main vruddhi ke liye NPN or PNP transistoron kii paryayakramik paraton ke saath do bijli-aapurti kaa upyog kiya
 The transistor was a great improvement over the transistor logic Inn
 aarambhik upkarnon main, fainout das tak sudhara or baad ke viksit prakaar ne bees tak hasil kiya
 TTL was also fast, with some converts achieving a short time of twenty nanoseconds of switching
 TTL abhi bhi kuch dizin main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Another contender was Emitter Coupled Logic
 yah bahut tej he lekin bahut bijli upyog karata he
 It is now mostly used in radio frequency circuits
 aadhunik ekikrut paripath, zyaadaatar CMOS ke roopantaron kaa upyog karte hai, jo sweekaarya rup se tej, bahut chote or bahut kam bijli kaa prayog karte hai
 Fanouts of forty or more are possible with some speed fines
 gaiyr electronic digital tantra nirmaan sambhav he
 In theory, discrete state representation and any technique capable of representing logic functions can be used to construct mechanical logic
 MIT ke chaatro, arleen gi, edward hardbek, danni hilis, margaret minsaki or bairi or bryan silverman bhai, ne tinkar khilone, string, ek eent or ek teevr pencil se do computer kaa nirmaan kiya
 Tinkertoy Computer is at the Boston Science Museum
 logic get ke hydrolic, viviya or yantric sanskaran maujuud hai or aisi sthitiyon main istemaal kiye jate hai jahaan bijli kaa upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa
 pehle do prakaar ko fludiks ke tahat mana jaataa he
 One use of fluidic logic is in military hardware that is likely to be exposed to an electromagnetic pulse that destroys electrical circuits
 yantric tark aksar aisi washing mashin main un logon ke rup main saste niyantrakon main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Famously, the first computer design by Charles Babbage was designed to use mechanical logic
 yantric logic ko, bahut chote computer main bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he jise naino takanic dwaara banaaya ja saktaa he
 Another example is that if two special enzymes are required to prevent the formation of a particular protein, it is equivalent to a biological "NAND gate"
 souparkanductivity kii khoj, rapid ekal flux kwantum ke vikaas circuit praudyogiki ko sambhav kar pai he joki transistor ke bajaay josephson jankshan kaa upyog karata he
 Recently, an attempt was made to construct a pure optical computing system, which is capable of processing digital information using nonlinear optical elements

 Aryabhata was a great astrologer and mathematician of ancient India
 inhone aryabhatiy granth kii rachana kii jisamen jyotishshastra ke anek siddhanton kaa pratipaadan he
 In the same book, he has written his birthplace Kusumpur and the birth term Saka Samvat 398
 bihar main vartmaan patna kaa pracheen naam kusumpur tha lekin aryabhat kaa kusumpur dakshin main tha, yah ab lagbhag siddh ho chukaa he
 According to another belief, he was born in the Ashmak country of Maharashtra
 unke vaigyanik kaaryon kaa samaadar rajdhani main hi ho saktaa tha
 Therefore, after a long journey, he completed his compositions in Rajsanidhi, located in Kusumpur near modern Patna
 yadhyapi aryabhat ke janm ke varsh kaa aryabhatiy main spasht ullekh he, unke janm ke vaastavik sthaan ke bare main vivaad he
 Some believe that they were born in the region between Narmada and Godavari, known as Ashmaka and they identify Ashmaka from central India, which includes Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, although the early Buddhist text called Ashmaka to the south , As Dakshinapath or Deccan, while other texts describe that the people of Ashmaka must have fought Alexander, according to Ashmaka should be further to the north
 ek taaja adhyayan ke anusaar aryabhat, kerala ke chamravattam ke nivasee the
 According to the study, Asmaka was a Jain region which was spread around Shravanabelagol and got its name Asmaka due to its stone pillars
 chamravattam is jain basti kaa hissaa tha, iskaa pramaan he bhartapuzha nadi jiskaa naam jainon ke puranic raja bharata ke naam par rakhaa gaya he
 Aryabhata also mentions King Bharata while defining the Yugas - the fifth verse of the Dasgeetika describes the time passed by the time of King Bharata
 un dinon main kusumpura main ek prasiddh vishvavidhyalay tha jahaan jainon kaa nirnaayak prabhaav tha or aryabhat kaa kaam is prakaar kusumpura pahunch sakaa or use pasand bhi kiya gaya
 However, it is fairly certain that at some point he went to Kusumpura for higher education and also lived there for some time
 bhaskar i ne kusumpura kii pahchaan patliputra ke rup main kii he
 He used to live there during the last days of the Gupta Empire
