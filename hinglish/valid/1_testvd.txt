 Man must have invented the first weapons with his experiences and intelligence
 ende yaa lathi kaa vikaas barchaa, gada, talwaar, ballab or aadhunik sangeen main hua
 Similarly, simple stone throwing was developed in spear, bow-arrow or archery, catapult, ball, bullet and modern nuclear bomb

 Probably the art of making shields by trapping leather in wooden poles will be very old
 kalantar main kavach or aadhunik yug main aakar kavachayaan kaa avishkaar hua
 It has been seen that whenever humans created the means of destruction, along with that, the means of defense also developed
 ayudhon kaa vargeekaran saadhaarant: unke prayog, vidhi ore visheshtaon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 According to them, the classification of weapons from stone age to the invention of gunpowder is as follows: shastr ve hathiyaar he jo phenke nahin jate
 The following weapons are under their subclassification: kaatanevaale shastr; jaise talwaar, parashu aadi; Barking weapons, such as barkha, trident, etc
; kund shastr, jaise gada
 Weapons are weapons that are thrown
 inke antargat ye astr hai : According to archaeologists, the knowledge of man increased with time and he thoughtfully started making stones and wooden weapons at will
 phir inhen shastron ko ghiskar sapaat, sudaul, teevr or chamkila bananaa aarambh kiya
 The main weapons of this period were stone axes, mace and knives
 sahasron varsh baad usne dhanush or bhaale kaa bhi nirmaan kiya
 Around 4,000 years BC By the time man had found the address of the metal
 taanbe or raange ko milakar usne kaansa bananaa janaa ore tab dhire-dhire pathar ke shastron kaa sthaan kaanse ke shastron ne le liya
 Weapons of this period, especially of the bow, arrow, spear, knife, spear, ax and mace, and only the shield of bronze are found in defensive tools
 kaanse kaa sthaan praaia: 1000 i
pus
 main lohe ne liya
 In the Vedic period the classification of astrasastras was as follows: amukta - ve shastr jo phenke nahin jate the
 Mukta - The weapons that were thrown
 inke bhi do prakaar the- muktam-mukt - The weapon used both by throwing or throwing
 muktsannivritti - ve shastr jo phenkakar lautaae ja sakate the
 Firearms are also mentioned, but not more clearly
 shastron kaa vargeekaran kai tarah se kar sakate hai
 Some scholars have given the following 3 characteristics of weapons - prasiddh sainya vichaarak je epa si fuller ne hathiyaaron main nimnlikhit visheshtaon kaa hona anivaary bataaya he- In addition to the above qualities, it is also necessary to have the following qualities in the best weapons - sharir ke vibhinn angon kii raksha kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 For example, leather and armor for the body, head for head and neck for neck etc
 europe main bhi isi prakaar ke shastr banate the
 The 12th-century armor was made by kneading small pieces of iron
 jirahabakhtar sundar or suvidhajanak avashya tha, par baari shastron kii chot se purnataya raksha nahin kar saktaa tha
 Hence from the 13th century AD, iron sheet coverings were made in Europe and they were worn over the mesh
 yoddha ab sir se paanv tak pattakvach se dhakaa rahata tha
 The joints in these armors were maintained for easy movement of body components
 peeche ashv ke liye bhi liye bhi aisa hi kavach banane laga
 The trap was also made for both horse and man
 savaar or ashv ke kavach kaa bhaar 200 se 300 pound tak hota tha
 The power of weapons also increased in the 13th century
 angrejon kaa lanbaa dhanush itnaa shaktishaalee hota tha ki usase chalaaya baan saadhaaran kavchon ko bhed detaa tha
 This bow was six feet long and its six foot arrow could shoot up to 250 yards easily
 isi prakaar switzaraland kaa 'hellbird kulhada' tha
 Its shaft was eight feet and along with the ax, it also had a serpentine fork to pull the spear and rider into it
 daksh ladaaka isaki chot se achche kavach ko bhi kaat saktaa tha
 The invention of gunpowder gave such power in the hands of man that changed the design of war
 yah nishchit he ki 14veen shatabdi ke aarambh main aagneyastra ban chuke the
 The first firearms were cannons
 yah mukhyat: do prakaar kii banaai gai - ek choti nalwali or duusari lambii naliwali 
 These cannons were first made of copper and bronze and then made of iron
 15veen shatabdi main topein 30 inch paridhi kii hoti thim or 1,200 se 1,500 pound bhaar ke pathar ke gole chalaati thim
 Modern howitzers and heavy fieldguns are developed forms of mortar and bombard
 isi shatabdi ke ant tak choti haath kii topein baniin
 They were replaced by hand guns in the early 15th century
 isi kaa vikaas dhire-dhire musket, machalock, flintlock or aadhunik rifl main hua
 The efforts of making rapid-firing guns and the use of this connection started from the 16th century and this led to the first successful machine gun in 1884
 aaj kii mashinagan ek minute main kai sau goliyaan tak chalaa sakati he
 Other important weapons were also invented in the 14th to 16th centuries, such as hand bombs, bronze explosive shells, pistols, dahk shells, etc
 shastron kaa adhik vikaas aadhunik kaal main hua
 By the 16th century, firearms had become so influential that man's defensive armor was in vain
 san 1915 kaa manushya aagneyastra ke saamne asahaay rahaa, parantu isi varsh pratham kavachayaan kaa nirmaan hua
 Man could now escape from the attack of light firearms by sitting in this car made of thick sheets of steel
 bandook, rifl or topon ke kaarykaran kaa siddhant ek hi he
 The gunpowder is kept in a strongly closed vessel on three sides and after that the vessel is temporarily sealed from the fourth side by placing a pellet, bullet or shot
 phir barood main kisi yukti se aag laga di jaati he
 The gunpowder is immediately burnt and converted into gases
 atyant kam sthaan main utpann hone ke kaaran ye gaisen bahut sampidit rahati hai
 Therefore, they press the pellets, pellets or shells very forcefully
 gola jab tak yantra ke naal main chalata rahata he tab tak usapar daab padati rahati he or uskaa veg badhata rahata he
 Thus a lot of velocity is produced in it
 naal ke kaaran uski disha bhi nirdhaarit ho jaati he; isliye naal ko ghuma firaakar gole ko icchaanusaar lakshya par maaraa ja saktaa he
 There is definite evidence of the use of cannon in Europe from 1313 AD
 bharat main babar ne panipat kii ladaai main topon kaa pehle-pehle prayog kiya
 The first cannons were made of bronze and were molded
 parantu aisi topein paryaapt pusht nahin hoti thim
 They used to burst by putting more ammo in them
 is dosha ko dur karne ke liye unke upar lohe ke challe tapt karke khub kasakar chadha die jate the
 When frost, such rings shrink and hold the inner cord very firmly, just as the wheel mounted on top of the bullock cart is pressed
 adhik pushtataa ke liye challe chadhaane ke pehle naal par lambaai ke anudish bhi lohe kii chaden ek duusari se sataakar rakh di jaati thim
 a famous cannon of the time is Mons Meg, which is now placed on the fortress of Edinburgh to adorn
 iske baad lagbhag 200 varshon tak top banane main koi vishesh unnati nahin hui
 In this era, the cluster of drains was smooth
 parantu lagbhag san 1520 main germany ke ek top banaanevaale ne sanchhidr main sarpilaakaar khaanche bananaa aarambh kiya
 This cannon consisted of longitudinal "shells" instead of circular shells
 sanchhidr main sarpilaakaar khaanchon ke kaaran prakshipt pind veg se naachne lagata he
 Thus the dancing object deviates much less from resistance to air and consequently falls more truthfully at the target
 1855 i
 main lard armastrang ne pitwaan lohe kii top kaa nirmaan kiya, jisamen pehle kii topon kii tarah munh kii ore se barood aadi bhari jane ke badale peeche kii ore se dhakkan hataakar yah sab saamagree bhari jaati thi
 40 pounds of it were filled in it
 saadhaaran topon main prakshipt bade veg se nikalataa he or top kii naal ko bahut unchi disha main nahin laayaa ja saktaa he
 On the other hand, small cannon guns are light and there is not much velocity in the projectile coming out of them, but they have the quality that the projectile falls very high up and down and hence it can kill the enemy hiding behind the wall, hill etc
 inhen morter kehete hai
 a cannon of mid-size is called a howitzer
 jaise-jaise topon ke banane main unnati hui vaise-vaise mortaron or houvitzron ke banane main bhi unnati hui
 In almost all countries, there was an advance in the manufacture of guns in the same way, because there was equal competition
 jab koi ek desh aadhik baari, adhik shaktishaalee yaa adhik furti se gola daagnevaali top banaata to baat bahut dinon tak chhipi na rahati or pratidwandvi deshon kii cheshtaa hoti ki usase bhi acchhee top banaai jaay
 In 1898, the French made a cannon that was to guide the guns that were made after that
 usase nikle prakshipt kaa veg adhik tha; uskaa aropan saraahneey tha; daagne par purnataya sthir rahata tha, kyonki aropan main aise daine lage the jo bhoomi main dhansakar top ko kisi dish main hilne na dete the
 All cannons retreat when fired
 is dhakke ke veg ko ghataane ke liye dravon kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 Its projections were made of thin walls
 inamen se prayek kii tol lagbhag 12 pound thi or usamen lagbhag saadhe teen pound ucch visphoti barood rahati thi
 There was also a cap containing special chemicals in the projectile, which caused the projectile to explode upon reaching the target and the pieces used to injure the enemy far and wide
 yah diwaar ke peeche chhipe sainikon ko bhi maar sakati he
 In the First World War, the Germans built a cannon called 'big Bertha', from which they started shelling 75 miles from Paris
 is top main koi nayaa siddhant nahin tha
 The cannon was only sufficiently large and athletic
 parantu hawaii jahaajon tathaa anya naveen yantron ke avishkaar se aisi topein ab luptpraaya ho gai hai
 The fireballs follow the same principle on which the ammunition arrows left on Deepawali
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke antim varsh main agnibaan bahut kaaryakari siddh hue
 There were 30 fireballs three-three inches in diameter and each one was filled with explosives called chordite
 prayek ke sir kaa bhaar 29 pound tha
 Each fire could go from 3,900 to 8,000 yards when fired
 prayek bijli ke switch se daaga jaataa tha
 These switches could either be arranged in such a way that the fireballs keep dropping automatically for half a second or as many fireballs or total fireballs at the same time
 ucch visphotak ke is ekaek dhamaake se shatru kii sena ko baari kshati pahunchati thi or vah atyant bhaybheet ho jaaya karti thi
 At the end of the Second World War, Germany created fireplaces with no human operator and far reaching names, named V-S and V-2
 dekhne main ve-ek vayuyan ke samaan hota tha
 It contained 130 gallons of petrol and the machine used to weigh about one ton
 udate samay iskaa veg 350 mile prati ghanta ho jaataa tha or chalane main yah bhayanak dhwani utpann karata tha
 a picture of V-2 is shown together
 isamen alcohol or drav oxygen kaa prayog hota tha
 Each arrow contained about three tons of alcohol and five tons of liquid oxygen
 iskaa mahattam veg lagbhag 3,000 mile prati ghanta tha
 The device was shaped like a cigar and about a tonne without fuel load
 vayuyan itane veg se chalate rahete hai ki unako top se maar giraanaa kathin hi hota tha, parantu amareeki vaigyanikon ne radar or vayuyanaghatak topon kaa aisa sambandh joda ki top apane aap vayuyan par sadhi rahati thi
 This was the victory over flying bombs of 1944, as these radar cannons killed about 70 percent of such bombs
 ye kai prakaar ke hote hai
 Some of the major bombs used in today's war are the following: 1
 vikhandak bam 2
 vidhvansak bam 3
 agnibam 4
 rasinic bam 5
 jeevanu bam 6
 vikiran bam Fragment bomb - It contains explosive material inside a special type of metal hollow vessel
 jab yah vayuyan athwa raaket se giraane par prithvi se takaraata he to dhamaake ke saath fat jaataa he or iske tukdon se log ghayal hote hai
 Sometimes it explodes in the air at some height above the earth when it is dropped from the plane
 in bamon kaa kul bhaar 2 ki
gra
 se lekar 50 ki
gra
 tak hota he
 These bombs are usually dropped over large areas
 vidhvansak bam - iskaa bhaar 50 ki
gra
 se lekar 1,000 ki
gra
 tak hota he
 It is filled with ordinary explosives
 agni bam - ye ghani aabaadeewale shaharon tathaa bade-bade kaarkaanon par giraae jate hai jinase ve jalakar nasht ho jate hai
 In it, the incendiary material is filled with a special kind of glowing pulp
 aag lagane ke liye phosforus, nepalm or thermite electron jaise rasinic yogic prayukt kiye jate hai or tab inke naam prayukt padaarth ke anusaar bhi ho jate hai
 Chemical bomb - This is a type of balloon with a thin wall
 yah vifailli vastuon se bharaa hua hota he
 If this bomb explodes in the air above the ground or something above the ground, toxic substances, gases, liquid or solid, whatever comes out of the shell, disintegrate into the ground or air and in a few moments the cloud surrounding the blast site She takes the form
 jeevanu bam - iskaa bhaar lagbhag 75 kri
gra
 tak hota he
 It consists of several chambers
 prayek kaksh main jeevanu, rogagrast keede athwa juen bhare hote hai
 When the bomb is dropped, the fuse in it rises and at the same time the covering of its chambers, which is occupied, opens with shock and the spread of disease-causing bacteria spread in the air
 yadi is bam ke khol kaa dhakkan jameen se 30 foot par khul jaataa he to ye jeevanu lagbhag 400 varg meter main fail jate hai
 In the area where bacterial bombs are dropped, humans, animals, animals and trees etc
 can all fall victim to disease because the whole environment gets contaminated
 vikiran bam - yah rasinic bam kii tarah hota he lekin iskaa khol kuch patala rahata he
 Inside it is filled with radium-explosive material
 visphot hone par ye padaarth dhul kii tarah hawa main mil jate hai jisase vahaan kii hawa radiumdharmi padaarthon se sandooshit ho jaati he
 In this way, the people there suffer from radioactive radiogenic diseases
 ye parmaanu bam evam hydrogen bam se bhi adhik bhayanak siddh hue hai
 These are the weapons that do not cause any explosion when dropped
 jeevanu astr main rog failaanevaale jeevanu hote hai or jis yuddh main ye istemaal kiye jate hai vah bahut bibhats evam sanhaarak hota he
 In the First World War, 51,259 American soldiers died on the battlefield, but after that the number of people who died of bacterial disease was 51,447
 pracheen kaal main log rogi ke shav ko dushmano ke ghere main daal dete the taaki unki mrityu jeevanuon ke madhyam se hone lage
 They are used as weapons in war and are of many types
 ye manushyon, pashuon tathaa paudhon main sankramak rog failaate hai
 They are used to reduce the enemy's ability to fight
 ye jeevanu uchit vaataavaran paane par bahut kam samay main lakhon sainikon ko rogagrast kar dete hai
 Many types of bacteria are used as a war weapon and each type of bacteria spreads different types of infectious diseases
 rog failaanevaale jeevanuon ke liye jin vibhinn sadhano kaa upyog sambhav he unamem se kuch sadhano ke naam nimnlikhit hai : Once released, these microorganisms are dispersed in the air and spread over thousands of miles along the air
 udaahranarth basilai ko airosol ke dwaara samudratat se 240 kimi kii lambaai main chhod diya jaae to ye apane aap 1,30,800 varg kimi bhubhag main fail jaayenge
 Thus, these bacteria spread diseases in that area
 aisa paaya gaya he ki astron ke hamale se maranevaale sainikon kii apeksha in rogaanuon ke sankraman se maranevaale sainikon kii sankhya adhik hoti he
 The immense ability to breed bacteria makes bacterial weapons more deadly
 yadi ye jeevanu ek baar jate hai to inhen nasht karnaa aasaan nahin hota
 These bacteria do not have any specific color, taste and smell
 in visheshtaon ke kaaran jeevanu astron kaa mahatv din-prati-din badhata ja rahaa he
 Sarada Devi was the spiritual companion of Guru Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the famous saint of India, Swami Vivekananda
 ramakrishna sangh main ve 'shrimaan' ke naam se parichit hai
 Sarada Devi was born on 22 December 1853 in a poor Brahmin family of a village called Jayarambati in Bengal province
 unke pita ramachandra mukhopadhyaay or mata shyamasundari devi kathor parishramee, satyanishth evam bhagavad parayan the
 He was married to Sri Ramakrishna when he was only 6 years old
 jab ramakrishna ke saath vivaah hetu koi yogya kanya nahin mil rahi thi tab thakur ne saamne se jayrambati main pataa lagane ke liye kaha tha or kaha tha ki is kanya kaa janm mere liye hi hua he
 Normally, marriage is done for Karma Prajottapati, but the marriage relationship of Sharada Devi and Ramakrishna was supernatural
 ramakrishna dev hameshaa sharada devi ko maan ke rup main hi dekhte the
 One day, to know the state of mind of Ramakrishna Dev, Mother Sharda asked him: 'tell me, who am i to you?' Ramakrishna replied without delay, that the mother who is sitting in the black idol, the mother is serving me as you
 ' unke vivaah sambandh main vishay vaasana ko koi sthaan nahin tha
 His devotees believe that Mother Sharda and Ramakrishna Dev were associates of each other for many births
 atharah varsh kii umr main ve apane pati ramakrishna se milane dakshineshwar pahaunchi
 Ramakrishna had spent more than twelve years in this difficult spiritual practice and attained the highest level of self-realization
 unhone bade pyaar se sarada devi kaa swaagat kar unhe sahaj rup se grahan kiya or gruhasthi ke saath saath aadhyatmik jivan vyateet karne kii shiksha bhi di
 Sarada Devi started fulfilling her daily duties while leading a holy life and receiving spiritual education like Ramakrishna's disciple
 ramakrishna sarada ko jaganmata ke rup main dekhte the
 On the night of Falaharini Kali Puja in 1872 AD, he worshiped Sarada as Jaganmata
 dakshineshwar main aanevaale shishy bhakton ko sarada devi apane bacchon ke rup main dekhati thim or unki bacchon ke samaan dekhbhaal karti thim
 Sarada Devi's day used to start at 3:00 am
 gangasnan ke baad ve jap or dhyaan karti thim
 Ramakrishna taught him divine mantras and also gave the necessary information to initiate people and guide them in spiritual life
 sarada devi ko shri ramakrishna kii pratham shishyaa ke rup main dekha jaataa hai
 Apart from the time given to her meditation, she used to spend the rest of the time preparing food for Ramakrishna and devotees
 1886 i
 main ramakrishna ke dehant ke baad sarada devi tirth darshan karne chali gayin
 After returning from there, she came to live in Kamarpukur

 After coming to Calcutta, she was revered as Sangh Mata among all the devotees and she gave protection and abbey as a mother to all
 anek bhakton ko diksha dekar unhen aadhyatmik maarg main prashast kiya
 In the early years, Swami Yogananda took responsibility for his service
 swami saradanand ne unke rahane ke liye kalakatta main udbhodan bhawan kaa nirmaan karavaaya
 His health deteriorated due to hard work and frequent malaria infections
 21 july 1920 ko shri maan sarada devi ne nashwar sharir kaa tyaag kiya
 a grand temple has been constructed at his mausoleum at Belur Math
 sarada devi ne koi kitaab nahin likhi unke bol swami nikhilanand or swami tapasyanand ne record kiye the
 The spiritual knowledge of Sarada Devi was very high

 He was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 2004 for his critique of Indian culture o Bhagavad Gita composed by him
 barood ek visphotak rasinic mishran he
 It is also called gun powder or black powder due to its dark color
 barood gandhak, koyala evam shora kaa mishran hota he or yah maanav itihaas kaa sarvapratham nirmit visphotak tha
 Gunpowder is used in firearms as fireworks and propellants
 barood chingaari paakar teji se jalataa he jisase baari maatra main gas evam garam thos paidaa hota he
 In modern times, gunpowder is known as a "weak explosive" because it produces non-extensible waves when exploded, not altitudinal waves
 isaliye barood ke jalane se utpann gaise itnaa hi daab paidaa kar paati hai jo goli ko aage phenkane main sahaayak hoti he kintu bandook kii nalee ko kshati nahin pahunchaa paati
 Use of gunpowder is not suitable for demolition of a rock or breaking a fort, but "TNT" etc
 are good for them
 vartmaan samay main barood ke maanak mishran main 75% shora, 15% komal lakdi kaa koyala tathaa 10% gandhak hota he
 It is not known exactly when it was invented, but it appears that the Chinese had knowledge of gunpowder in the BC era

 Its use in projectile throwing in weapons of the late 13th century is traced

 These machines were run by horses or water
 inke sthaan par baad main stampig mashin kaa upyog shuru hua, par yah niraapad nahin tha
 The powders that were made earlier were made by mixing the powders of the three ingredients
 aise chure ko topon main bhalee bhanti na to bahut ksaa ja saktaa tha ore na dhilaa hi choda ja saktaa tha
 To overcome this difficulty, in the 15th century, there was an attempt to obtain the shred in granular form
 chure main alcohal, yaa mutr, milakar use daanedaar banaaya jaataa tha
 The urine of the alcoholic was considered best for this
 isse bane dane adhik shaktishaalee hote the
 The grains were of different sizes and were used to separate them
 bade dane topon main or chote dane banduukon main istemaal hote the
 There was a special improvement in getting the ingredients in pure form and making them ammo and granulating them
 acha koyala bhi ab banane laga tha
 It was called brown or cocoa coal and was made from grain straw called rye
 par etdarth puaal ko puraa puraa tapate nahin the
 The following were the proportions of ingredients in general ammo
 shora 75 pratishat, koyala 15 pratishat or gandhak 10 pratishat
 In the new mixture, their relative amounts were 80, 16, 3 respectively and one part was also water
 aisa barood bahut safal siddh hua
 In the use of a stamping machine, as stated above, there was a fear of danger
 iske sthaan main chakra yaa hvil mil kaa prayog sharu hua
 Nowadays, only the advanced form of Chakra or wheel mill is used

 This method is called the Balennal method
 sabhi pandav sab prakaar kii vidyaon main praveen the
 The Pandavas conquered all directions and Yudhishthira began to rule
 mayanirmit sabhabhavan main anek vaichitrya the
 When Duryodhana was roaming there, he got water on the spot several times, the water on the site, the door in the wall and the wall in the door was confused
 kahin vah seedhi main samtal kii bhranti hone ke kaaran gir gaya or kahin pani ko sthal samaj pani main bhig gaya
 In addition to Yudhishthira, the other four Pandavas started laughing when he fell in such a step
 duryodhana parihaaspriy nahin tha
 So, water got jealous, jealousy etc
 rajasuya yajna main raja anek prakaar kii bhent lekar aaye the
 In the Dwijs, the chief Kunind gave a conch shell to Dharmaraja, who himself would ring at the offering
 uski dhwani se vahaan upasthit sabhi raja tejohin tathaa murchhit ho gayi, maatr dhridhyumna, pandav, saatyaki tathaa aathven shrikrishna dhairyapurvak khadey rahe
 When Duryodhana etc
 became unconscious, Pandavas etc
 started laughing loudly and Arjuna, being very happy, surrendered five hundred bulls to a Brahmin
 yudhisthir ne vah shankh arjuna ko bhentswaroop de diya
 Duryodhana was irritated by many incidents and so while going to Hastinapur, he thought of a trick to beat the Pandavas with Mama Shakuni and accept his glory Shakuni was adept at Dutikrida - Yudhishthira must have a hobby but did not know how to play
 at un sabane milakar dhritarashtra ko manaa liya
 On opposing Vidur, Dhritarashtra also asked him to go to Indraprastha and invite Yudhishthira, and also said that he should not tell the Pandavas about his plan
 vidura unka sandesh lekar pandavon ko aamantrit kar aaye
 Upon reaching the Pandavas in Hastinapur, Vidur informed them of the whole plan in solitude, however Yudhishthira accepted the challenge and after losing all the individual claims at Dutikrida, he lost the brothers to himself, and finally to Draupadi
 vidura ne kaha ki apane-apko daanv par haarane ke baad yudhisthir draupadi ko daanv par lagane ke adhikari nahin rah jate, kintu dhritarashtra ne pratikaami naamak sevak ko draupadi ko vahaan le aane ke liye bheja
 Draupadi asked her the same question as to which Dharmaputra lost the first bet - his own or that of Draupadi
 duryondhan ne cruddh hokar du:shashan se kaha ki vah draupadi ko sabhabhavan main lekar aaye
 Yudhishthira secretly sent a trusted servant to Draupadi saying that though he is a menstruator and in a robe, he got up and walked in the same way, reaching in front of the worshiping class in the assembly, in that condition, in the condition of the sins of Duryodhana etc
 Would be enough to express
 draupadi sabha main pahunchi to du:shashan ne use stri varg kii ore nahin jane diya tathaa uske bal khinchakar kaha- 'hamane tuje jue main jeeta he
 Therefore, you will keep you in your maids
 ' draupadi ne samast kuruvanshiyon ke shaury, dharm tathaa niti ko lalakaara or shrikrishna ko man-hi-man samaran kar apni lajja kii raksha ke liye prarthana kii
 All remained silent, but Duryodhana's younger brother Vikarna took the side of Draupadi, saying that the loser Yudhishthira could not keep him at stake but no one listened to him
 karn ke uksaane se du:shashan ne draupadi ko nirvastra karne kii cheshtaa kii
 While Draupadi looked at the Pandavas while mourning, Bhima told Yudhishthira that he wanted to burn his hands, from whom he had gambled
 arjuna ne use shant kiya
 Bhima swore that he would drink the blood of the breast of sorrow and destroy Duryodhana's thigh with his mace
 draupadi ne vikat vipatti main shrikrishna kaa samaran kiya
 By the grace of Sri Krishna, many clothes appeared there, which kept Draupadi covered, consequently, while pulling her clothes off, the misery did not make her naked
 sabha main baar-baar kaary ke anauchity athwa auchity par vivaad chhid jaataa tha
 Duryodhana left the decision on Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadev to see the Pandavas silently, 'draupadi ki, loser stakes' is right or wrong
 arjuna tathaa bhim ne kaha ki jo vyakti swayan ko daanv main haraa chukaa he, vah kisi anya vastu ko daanv par rakh hi nahin saktaa
 Dhritarashtra, recognizing the pulse of the gathering, rebuffed Duryodhana and asked Draupadi to ask for three brides
 draupadi ne pehle var se yudhisthir kii dasabhaav se mukti maangi taaki bhavishya main uskaa putr prativindhyas das putr na kehalaae
 Bhima, Arjuna Nakula and Sahadeva from the second groom, with weapons and chariot, sought freedom from slavery
 teesraa var maangane ke liye vah taiyaar hi nahin hui, kyonki uske anusaar kshatriya striyon do var maangane kii hi adhikarini hoti hai
 Dhritarashtra asked him to forget his entire past and maintain his affection, as well as allow him to go to Khandav forest and enjoy his kingdom
 dhritarashtra ne unke khandavavan jane se purv, duryodhana kii prerana se, unhen ek baar phir se jua khilne kii ajna di
 It was decided that only one bet would be placed
 pandav athwa dhritarashtra putron main se jo bhi haar jaayenge, ve mrigcharm dhaaran kar baarah varsh vanvaas karenge or ek varsh agyatavaas main rahenge
 If he is recognized in that one year, then he will have to suffer twelve years of exile
 bhishma, vidura, dron aadi ke rokane par bhi dyutakrida hui jisamen pandav haar gayi, chali shakuni jeet gaya
 Before the exodus, the Pandavas took an oath that they would breathe peace by destroying all enemies

 Dengue fever is an infection caused by the dengue virus
 dengue kaa ilaaj samay par karnaa bahut jaruri hota hai
 machhar dengue virus ko sancharit karte hai
 Dengue fever is also known as "bone fracture", because it can cause so much pain to the people who have broken their bones
 dengue bukaar ke kuch lakshanon main bukhaar; sirdard; twachaa par chechak jaise laal chakatte tathaa mansapeshiyon or jodon main dard shaamil hai
 In some people, dengue fever can occur in one or two forms that can be life-threatening
 pehla, dengue rakthasravi bukaar he, jiske kaaran rakt vahikaaon, main raktasrav yaa risaav hota he tathaa rakt platelets kaa str kam hota he
 The second is dengue shock syndrome, which leads to dangerously low blood pressure
 dengue virus chaar bhinn-bhinn prakaaron ke hote hai
 If a person gets an infection from one of these types of viruses, then usually he is protected from that type of dengue virus throughout his life
 halanki baaki ke teen prakaaron se vah kuch samay ke liye hi surakshit rahata he
 If he is infected with one of these three types of virus, then he is more likely to have serious problems
 logon ko dengue virus se bachaane ke liye koi vaxin uplabdh nahin he
 There are some measures that should be taken to save people from dengue fever
 log apane ko machharon se bachaa sakate hai tathaa unase kaate jane kii sankhya ko simit kar sakate hai
 Scientists say that mosquitoes can grow and shrink
 yadi kisi ko dengue bukaar ho jaay to vah aamtaur par apni beemaari ke kam yaa simit hone tak paryaapt taral pikar thik ho saktaa he
 If the person's condition is more serious, he may need intravenous or blood transfusion
 1960 se, kaaphi log dengue bukaar se peedit ho rahe hai
 The disease has become a worldwide problem since World War II
 yah 110 deshon main aam he
 Each year around 50–100 million people suffer from dengue fever
 virus kaa pratyaksh upachaar karne ke liye log vaxin tathaa dawaaon par kaam kar rahe hai
 People also take many different measures to get rid of mosquitoes
 dengue bukaar kaa pehla varnan 1779 main likhaa gaya tha
 In the early 20th century, scientists learned that the disease is caused by the dengue virus and it is transmitted through mosquitoes
 dengue ko kai varshon purv sabase pehle likhaa gaya tha
 The Jin Encyclopedia of Chinese Medicine speaks of a person who may have had dengue
 kitaab ek "jal jehar " rog ke bare main bataata he jiskaa sambandh udne vaale kiton se tha
 Written documents from the 17th century also discuss an epidemic that may be dengue
 sabase adhik sambhavit dengue mahamari kii aarambhik report 1779 tathaa 1780 kii he
 These reports speak of an epidemic that engulfed Asia, Africa and North America
 us samay se 1940 tak bahut sari mahamariyaan nahin hui
 In 1906, scientists proved that people were getting infected with "aedes" mosquitoes
 1907 main vaigyanikon ne darshaya ki dengue kaa kaaran virus he
 This was only the second disease that was shown to be caused by the virus
 jon bartan clayland tathaa joseph franklin siller dengue ke virus kaa adhyayan karte rahe or virus ke vistaar ke aadhaar kaa pataa lagaaya
 Dengue started spreading more rapidly after the second world war
 mana gaya ki yuddh ne paryaavaran ko kai tareeko se badla
 Different types of dengue spread to new areas
 logo ko pehali baar rakthasravi dengue bukhaar hona shuru hua
 This horrific type of Daegu was first reported in the Philippines in 1953
 1970 ke aate-aate rakthasravi dengue bukhaar bacchon main mrityu kaa pramukh kaaran ban gaya
 It started happening in the Pacific region and also in America
 rakthasravi dengue bukhaar tathaa dengue shock syndrome sabase pehle madhya tathaa dakshin america main 1981 main report kiya gaya
 At this time healthcare professionals noticed that those who had been affected by the type 1 dengue virus were being affected by the type 2 dengue virus after a few years
 yah spasht nahin he ki shabd "dengue" kahaan se aayaa
 Some people believe that the word came from the Swahili phrase ka-dinga pepo
 yah vaakyansh buree atmaaon se hone vaali beemaari ke bare main bataata he
 The Swahili word dinga is believed to be derived from the Spanish word dengue
 is shabd kaa arth he "saavdhaan"
 The term may have been used to refer to a person who suffers from bone pain of dengue fever; That pain would force the person to walk with caution
 halanki, yah bhi sambhav he ki spani shabd swahili bhashaa se aayaa ho, na ki jaisaa upar bataaya gaya he
 Others believe that the name "dengue" came from the West Indies
 west indies main, dengue se peedit gulam "e dendi" kii tarah khadey hone vaale or chalane vaale kahe jate the or isi kaaran se beemaari ko bhi "dendi fever" kaha jaataa tha
 The name "bone-breaking fever" was first used by the United States "founding father" Benjamin Rush, a physician
 1789 main rash ne "haddi-tod bukhaar " naam kaa upyog ek report main kiya jo 1780 main philadelphia main huye dengue ke prakope par thi
 In the report, Rush used the more formal name "billius Remitting Fever"
 shabd "dengue bukhaar" 1828 tak aam taur par upyog main nahin tha
 Earlier, different people used different names for the disease
 udhaaharan ke liye dengue ko "brikeheart fever" tathaa "laa dengue" bhi kaha jaataa tha
 Several names were used for complex dengue: for example "infectus thrombocytopenic purpura", "philippine", "thai" and "singapore hemorrhagic fever"
 dongu kaa pratham mahamari roopen hamalaa ek saath asia, africa, uttari america me ek saath 1780 ke lagbhag hua tha, is rog ko 1779 me pahachaanaa tathaa naam diya gaya tha
 In the 1950s, it started spreading in this continuous epidemic in Southeast Asia and by 1975, dengue hemorrhage fever has become the leading cause of child death in these countries
 1990 ke dashak tak dengue malaria ke pashchaat machharon dwaara failane vaala doosraa sabase bada rog ban gaya jisase saal bhar me 4 karod log sankramit hote he vahiin dengue hamerej fever ke bhi hajaaron maamle saamne aate he
 In February 2002, when dengue spread in Rio de Janeiro, 1 million people were hit by it, due to which 16 people died
 march 2008 tak bhi is shahar me dasha bahut acchhee nahin thi keval 3 maheene main 23,555 maamle or 30 maute hui thi
 There is a big outbreak of dengue in about five to six years, because the annual cycle that comes with this disease gives resistance to the patients for some time, as in cases of chikungunya
 jab yah pratirodh kshamta samaapt ho jaati he to log rog ke prati phir se samvedansheel ho jate he, phir dengue ke chaar prakaar ke virus hote he, iske alaava naye log jansankhya me janm yaa pravaas ke jariye jud jate he
 There is ample evidence that SB Halstead has proved by a study that dengue haemorrhagic fever is more common in patients who suffer from secondary infections than those with primary infection
 yadhpi is dharna ko thik se samajha nahin ja sakaa he keval kuch model he jo iske bare me mat vyakt karte he, is dasha ko paramsankraman kii dasha kehete he
 Every year 4000-5000 cases of this disease occur in Singapore, however the common belief is that many cases remain hidden
 dengue ke lakshan dengue virus se sankramit lagbhag 80% logon main koi lakshan nahin hote hai yaa behad halke lakshan hote hai
 About 5% of the infected people become seriously ill
 in logon kii ek choti sankhya main, beemaari jivan ke liye khatarnaak hoti he
 Symptoms occur in a person 3 to 14 days after suffering from dengue virus
 lakshan aksar 4 se 7 dinon ke baad hi dikhte hai
 In this way, if a person returns from an area where dengue is common and he or she has fever or other symptoms 14 days after his or her return, then he / she may not have dengue
 aksar jab bacchon ko dengue bukaar hota he to unke lakshan aam sardi-zukaam yaa antrashoth ) hote hai
 However, children are more likely to develop serious problems with dengue fever
 dengue bukaar ke aise adarsh lakshan kam hote hai jo achaanak shuru ho jate hai jaise sirdard ; chakatte tathaa mansapeshiyon or jodon main dard
 The disease's nickname "bone fracture" refers to how severe this pain can be
 dengue bukaar teen charnon In the fever phase, a person usually has high fever
 bukaar aksar 40 degree celsius hota he
 The person may have general pain and headache
 yah charan aamtaur par 2 se 7 din tak chalata he
 About 50 to 80% of the people who have symptoms in this stage have rashes
 pehle yaa duusare din, chakatte laal twachaa jaise dikh sakate hai
 In the later days of the disease, rashes may look like smallpox
 chote laal daag twachaa par ubhar sakate hai
 These stains do not remove on pressing the skin
 ye laal daag tuuti keshikaon ke kaaran banate hai
 The person may have mild bleeding from the mouth and nose through the mucous membrane
 bukaar apane aap kam hone lagata he tathaa ek yaa do dinon ke liye waapas hone lagata he
 However, this pattern varies among different people
 kuch logon main, ucch bukaar ke jane ke baad beemaari gambhir charan main pravesh kar jaati he
 The severe phase lasts from one to two days
 is charan ke dauraan, chaati tathaa pet main taral kaa nirmaan ho saktaa he, aisa isaliye kyonki rakt nalikaaon main risaav hota he
 Fluid is formed and it circulates throughout the body
 iskaa arth he ki mahatvapurn angon ko unki aavashyaktaa ke anusaar aam taur par rakt nahin miltaa he
 For this reason, organs are unable to function normally
 vyakti ko atyadhik raktasrav bhi ho saktaa he 
 Less than 5% of people with dengue experience circulatory shock, dengue stroke syndrome and dengue hemorrhagic fever
 yadi kisi vyakti ko pehle kisi duusare prakaar kaa dengue hua ho to usko aisi gambhir samasyaayein hone kii sambhaavnaaen adhik hoti hai
 In the rectification phase, the fluid that leaks out of the blood vessels is incorporated back into the bloodstream
 sudhaar charan 2 se 3 dinon tak chalata he
 The person often becomes much better during this phase
 halanki, unako gambhir khujalaahat tathaa dhimi hriday gati kii shikaayat ho sakati he
 During this phase, the person may go into a liquid overload state
 yadi yah dimag ko prabhavit karata he to, yah chetana ke str main parivartan yaa daure jaisi sthiti laa saktaa he 
 Sometimes dengue can affect other mechanisms of our body
 kisi vyakti main keval lakshan ho sakate hai yaa adarsh dengue lakshan bhi saath main ho sakate hai
 The level of consciousness may decrease in 0
5–6% of cases
 aisa tab ho saktaa he jab dengue virus mastishk main sankraman paidaa karata he
 This can happen even when vital organs are not functioning properly
 anya snayutantr sambandhi vikaar un logon main darj kiye gayi hai jinako dengue bukaar hota he
 For example, dengue can cause transverse myelitis and guillian-barre syndrome
 halanki aisa lagbhag nahin hota he, lekin dengue dil kaa sankraman tathaa gambhir jigar kii vifaltaa paidaa kar saktaa he
 Dengue fever is caused by dengue virus
 vah vaigyanik pranali jisamen virus kaa vargeekaran tathaa namakaran kiya jaataa he uske antargat dengue virus "flaviviriday" parivaar tathaa "flaviviras" jin kaa hissaa he
 Other viruses also belong to this family and can cause diseases in humans
 udhaaharan ke liye, pit-fever virus, west nile virus, saint louis anseflitis virus, japani anseflitis virus, tik- janit anseflitis virus, kyasanur jangal rog virus tathaa omsk rakthasravi bukaar, sabhi "flaviviriday" parivaar se sambandhit hai
 
 Most of these viruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks
 dengue virus, adhiktar adies machharon dwaara sancharit hota he, vishesh rup se adies aegypti prakaar ke machhar se
 These mosquitoes usually occur at altitudes less than 1000 m, at 350 north and 350 south latitudes
 yah adhiktar din ke samay katate hai
 a single bite can also infect humans
 kabhi-kabhaar machharon ko bhi maanvon se dengue mil saktaa he
 If a female mosquito bites an infected person, the mosquito can get the dengue virus
 sabase pehle virus un koshikaon main rahata he jo machhar ke pet main hoti hai
 After about 8 to 10 days, the virus gets infected by the salivary glands of the mosquito that make up the saliva
 iskaa arth he machhar dwaara banaayi gayi laar dengue ke virus se sankramit hoti he
 Therefore, when mosquitoes bite a human, their infected saliva can infect a human
 virus un sankramit machharon ke liye koi samasya paidaa nahin karte dikhte hai, jo apane puure jivan bhar sankramit rahenge
 It is most likely that the Aedes aegypti mosquito spreads dengue
 aisa isaliye ki kyonki ye maanvon ke sabase adhik nazadik rahete hai or jaanwaron kii bajaay maanvon par jite hai
 It prefers to lay eggs in vessels containing man-made water
 dengue sankramit rakt utpaadon tathaa ang daan dwaara fail saktaa he
 If a person infected with dengue donates blood or organ, which is given to another person, this person may get dengue from the blood or organ donated
 kuch deshon jaise singapore main dengue aam he
 In these countries, 1
6 to 6 out of 10,000 blood transfusions spread dengue
 garbhavastha ke dauraan yaa bachche ko janm dete samay dengue virus maan se bachche main bhi fail saktaa he
 Dengue usually does not spread in any other way
 dengue se peedit vayaskon se adhik shishuon tathaa bacchon main beemaari kii gambhirtha hone kii adhik sambhaavna hoti he
 Children are more likely to become seriously ill if they are well nourished
 mahilaon kii apeksha purushon main gambhir beemaari kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he
 Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma
 jab machhar kisi vyakti ko katata he to isaki laar maanav kii twachaa main pravesh kar jaati he
 If the mosquito has dengue, the virus is in its saliva
 isaliye jab machhar kisi vyakti ko katata he to virus machhar kii laar ke saath vyakti kii twachaa main pravisht ho jaataa he
 The virus attaches to the white blood cells of the person and enters them
 jab shwet rakt kanikaayen sharir main idhar-udhar jaati hai to virus purnutpaadan karata he
 White blood cells react through a variety of signaling proteins such as interleukins, interferons, and tumor necrosis factors
 in protein ke kaaran dengue ke saath bukhaar, flu jaise lakshan tathaa gambhir dard paidaa hote hai
 If a person has severe infections then the virus grows more rapidly in his body
 kyonki virus kii sankhya bahut adhik he isaliye ye kai or angon ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Blood escapes from the walls of small blood capillaries into the body's coters
 is kaaran se rakt keshikaon main kam rakt kaa pravaah hota he
 a person's blood pressure falls so low that the heart is not able to supply enough blood to vital organs
 saath hi, asthi majja paryaapt platelets kaa nirmaan nahin kar paati he, jo rakt kaa thakka banane ke liye jaruri he
 Without adequate platelets, the person is quite likely to have bleeding problems
 raktasrav, dengue ke kaaran paidaa hone vaali mukhya jatilta he
 Health care professionals usually diagnose dengue by examining the infected person and seeing that his symptoms resemble dengue
 swasthya seva peshewar, is prakaar se dengue kaa nidaan karne main un kshetron main vishesh rup se sakasham ho sakate hai jahaan par yah aam taur par hota he
 However, when dengue is in its early stages, it is difficult to distinguish it from other viral infections
 kisi vyakti ko sambhawatah dengue tab ho saktaa he jab usko bukhaar ho tathaa nimna main se do lakshan holematlee or ulti; laal chakatte; saamaanya dard ; shwet rakt kanikaon ko kii kam sankhya; yaa sakaaratmak turnicket pareekshan
 Any warning sign and fever in areas where this disease is common is a sign that a person has dengue
 chetavanee chihn aam taur par dengue ke gambhir hone ke pehle dikhne lagate hai
 Tourniquet testing is sufficient when no laboratory tests can be performed
 turnicket pareekshan main swasthya seva peshewar raktchaap naapane vaale upkaran kaa patta vyakti kii bahon ke chaaron ore 5 minute tak baandhta he
 If the person sees red spots on the person's skin, then the healthcare professional counts them
 dhabbon kii sankhya jitani adhik hogi vyakti ko dengue bukhaar hone kii sambhaavna utani adhik hogi
 Differentiating between chikungunya and dengue fever can be difficult
 chikangunia ek aisa viral sankraman he jisamen dengue jaise samaan lakshan hote hai tathaa yah bhi vishwa ke unhi hisson main hota he
 Symptoms of dengue may be other diseases such as malaria, leptopirosis, typhoid fever and meningococcal disease
 aksar, kisi vyakti main dengue kaa nidaan hone ke pehle, uske swasthya seva peshewar is baat ko sunishchit karne ke liye ki vah vyakti inamen se kisi ek paristhiti se peedit na ho, kuch pareekshan karenge
 When a person has dengue, the first change can be seen in a laboratory test of a small number of white blood cells
 kam platelets sankhya tathaa chayapachay amlaraktata bhi dengue ke lakshan hai
 If the person has severe dengue then there will be other changes that can be seen by studying blood
 gambhir dengue ke kaaran rakt dhaaraon se taral kaa risaav ho saktaa he
 This can cause hemoconcentration
 yah rakt main albumin ke str ko bhi kam karata he
 Occasionally severe dengue also produces more pleural effusion or ascites
 yadi isaki maatra paryaapt ho to swasthya seva peshewar ise rogi ke pareekshan ke samay dekh saktaa he
 a healthcare professional may already notice dengue shock syndrome if he or she can use medical ultrasound to look for fluid within the body
 lekin bahut saare aise kshetron main jahaan par dengue aam he, adhiktar swasthya seva peshewaron tathaa chikitsaalayon main ultrasound mashine nahin hoti hai
 In 2009, the World Health Organization classified or divided dengue fever into two types: simple and severe
 iske pehle 1997 main WHO ne rog ko avibhedit tathaa dengue bukhaar main baanta tha
 The WHO decided that this old method of dividing dengue fever needed to be simplified
 isane yah bhi tay kiya ki purana tarika kaaphi simit tha: isamen ve sabhi tareeke shaamil nahin the jinase dengue apane ko prastut kar saktaa tha
 Although the method of dengue classification was officially changed, the old classification is still used
 WHO kii puraani paddati main dengue rakthasravi bukhaar ko chaar charnon main vibhakt kiya gaya tha, jinako grad I–IV kaha jaataa tha: Dengue fever can be diagnosed by laboratory testing of microbiology
 kuch bhinn pareekshan bhi kiye ja sakate hai
 a test in the culture of the cells isolates the dengue virus
 ek anya pareekshan virus se neucleic amlon kii pahchaan karata he, jisamen polimress chen riection kahi jane vaali takanic kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 a third test identifies the virus's antigen
 ek anya pareekshan rakt main unpratirakshiyon kii pahchaan karata he jo dengue virus se sharir ko ladane kii kshamta dete hai
 Virus isolation and nucleic acid detection tests are better than antigen detection
 halanki in pareekshanon kii laagat adhik hoti he, isaliye ye adhik sthanon par uplabdh nahin hai
 All these tests can be negative when dengue disease is in its early stages
 pratirakshi pareekshan ke alaava ye prayogshaala pareekshan keval beemaari ke gambhir charan ke dauraan dengue bukhaar ke nidaan main sahaayak ho sakate hai
 However, immunological tests can confirm that a person is in a later stage of dengue infection
 sharir pratirakshiyon kaa nirmaan karata he jo vishisht rup se 5 se 7 dinon baad dengue virus se ladate hai
 No vaccine has yet been approved to protect people from dengue virus
 sankraman ko rokane ke liye vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne machharon kii jansankhya ko niyantrit karne tathaa logon ko machharon ke kaate jane se bachaane kaa suzav diya he
 The WHO has suggested a program for prevention of dengue which consists of 5 different parts: machharon ko niyantrit karne tathaa logon ko isse kaate jane se bachaane ke liye WHO kuch vishisht suzav bhi detaa he
 The best way to control the "aedes aegypti" mosquito is to get rid of its habitats
 logon ko pani ke khule paatro ko khaali rakhana chaiye 
 Pesticides or biological control agents can also be used to control mosquitoes in these areas
 vaigyanikon kaa yah maananaa he ki organophosphate yaa pirethyroid insecteside kaa chhidkaav koi sahaayta nahin karata he
 Stagnant water should be eliminated because it attracts mosquitoes and also because bacteria can be born in this stagnant water causing health problems
 machharon ke kaatane se bachane ke liye log aise kapade pahan sakate hai jo puri tarah se unki twachaa ko junk kar rakhen
 They can use insecticides, which will keep mosquitoes away
 log, aaraam karte samay masahari kaa bhi upyog kar sakate hai
 There is no vaccine present in the market at this time, although the experiments in Thailand have been largely successful
 dengue se bachaav kaa sabase prabhavi tarika machharon kii aabaadi pe kaabo karnaa he is ke liye yaa to larva pe niyantran karnaa hota he yaa vayask machharon kii aabaadi par
 Aedes mosquitoes breed in artificial water storage containers such as tires, bottles, coolers, bouquets
 These vessels should be emptied frequently
 This is considered the best method of larval control
 vayask machharon ko kaabo me karne hetu kitnashak dhuna kisi seemaa tak prabhavi ho sakate he, machharon ko kaatane se roak dena bhi ek tarika he kintu is prajati ke machhar din me katate he jisase maamla gambhir ban jaataa he
 a new method is to put an aquatic insect called Mesosaclopus that is a larval eater into stagnant water such as gambusia fish as an effective remedy against malaria
 yah behad prabhavi, sasta tathaa paryaavaran mitra vidhi he iske viruddh machhar kabhi pratirohak kshamta hasil nahin kar sakate he kintu is hetu saamudayik bhagidaari sakriy rup se chahie
 Mosquito nets, repellent, covering the body, and staying away from the affected areas
 pit fever kii vaikaseen ek sambandhit flavivyras ke viruddh he use dengue ke viruddh parivartit rup main prayog karne kii salaah di jaati he kintu is sambandh me koi vistrut adhyayan nahin kiya gaya he
 In 2006, a scientific group from Argentina discovered the breeding method of the virus, which is expected to find an effective drug against it
 dengue bukhaar ke liye koi vishisht upachaar nahin he
 Depending on the symptoms, there are different treatments for different people
 kuch log gharon par maatr taral pikar behatar ho sakate hai, jiske saath unke swasthya seva peshewar najdiki rup se unke swasthya kii nigaraanee karke yah sunishchit kar sakate hai ki ve behatar ho rahe hon
 Some others may require intravenous or blood transfusion
 yadi kisi vyakti kii pehle se jatil swasthya sthiti kii samasya he to, swasthya seva peshewar us vyakti ko aspataal main bhartee karne kaa nirnay le sakate hai
 When a person needs intravenous fluid, usually they may need it for a day or two
 swasthya seva peshewar taral kii maatra ko badhayega jisase ki vyakti mutr kii ek tay maatra nirgat kar sake
 The amount of fluid can also be increased so that a person's hematocrit and vital signs can return to normal
 raktasrav ke jokhim ke kaaran swasthya seva peshewar, nasogastric intubeshan, antahpeshiy injection tathaa dhamniyon main panchar karnaa jaisi aakraamak chikitsa prakriyaaon se bachate hai
 Acetaminophen can be given for fever and pain
 sujan-rodhi dawa kaa ek prakaar jise NSAID kehete hai, prayog nahin kii jaani chaiye kyonki raktasrav hone kii kaaphi sambhaavna hoti he
 If the vital signs of the person do not change or become normal and if the number of red blood cells in their blood is decreasing, then blood transfusion should be started early
 jab rakt aadhaan kii aavashyaktaa ho to vyakti ko sampurna rakt yaa pack kii gayi laal rakt kanikaon ko diya janaa chaiye
 Platelets and freshly frozen plasma are generally not recommended
 jab vyakti dengue ke sudhaar vaale charan main hota he to aam taur par use or antah shira dravya nahin diye jate hai jisase ki uske sharir main taral kii maatra adhik na ho
 If there is an excess of liquor but the vital signs of that person are fixed, then it is enough to stop giving more money
 yadi vyakti rog kii jatil avasthaa main na ho to, use furosemide jaise loop mutrvardhak diye ja sakate hai
 This will help in removing excess fluid from the blood circulation of that person
 dengue se peedit adhiktar log thik ho jate hai or unako baad main kisi tarah kii koi samasya nahin hoti he
 1 to 5% of people infected with dengue die due to lack of treatment
 achche upachaar ke baavjood 1% se kam logon kii mrityu ho jaati he
 However, 26% of people suffering from severe dengue die
 dengue 110 se adhik deshon main aam he
 Each year, 50 to 100 million people around the world are affected by it
 prayek varsh, puri duniya ke iske chalate aadhe million log aspataal main bhartee hote hai tathaa lagbhag 12,500 se 25,000 logon kii mrityu ho jaati he
 Dengue is the most common viral disease spread by arthropods

 Dr
 Bholanath Tiwari has put the sound changes in the following sections based on the form- dhwani parivartan aitihaasik or bhugolic donon kaarnon se hota he
 The formation of the word 'fire' from 'fire' will be called sound change

 Like 'brahmin' pronunciation of 'brahmin'
 isi prakaar apane aas-paas kii dhvaniyon ke kaaran bhi kori dhwani prayog main aate-aate parivartit ho jaati he
 For example, if there is a Ghosh dish around a dishonor dish, it becomes Ghosh
 jaise 'kankan' kaa 'kangan' yaa 'shaak' kaa 'saag'
 Similarly, due to similarity with some other words, the sounds of some words are changed due to their being spoken like them
 jaise- sanskrit kaa 'ekadash' shabd 'dwadash' ke saadrishy par 'ekadash' ke rup main bolaa jane laga
 In addition to these historical changes, there are also sound changes due to the interaction of languages
 ek bhashaa ke kuch shabd jab duusari bhashaa main apanaae jate hai to unamem dhwani parivartan hota he
 For example, 'mumbai' is the corresponding form of Marathi
 jiskaa hindi main parivartit tadbhav rup 'bombari' or angreji main 'bambe' he
 This sound change is due to language differences or geographical changes
 bhugolic vistaar ke kaaran bhi dhwani parivartan hota he
 Changing the area changes the language
 jis bhashaa kaa bhugolic vistaar hota he uski dhvaniyon ke uccharan main desh-bhed se bhi anek parivartan hote hai
 These changes of sound change can be called alternative forms of the same sound form

 There was so much competition to advertise it that sometimes for six months all the advertising time was sold out
 hawamahal vividh bharti ke shuruuaati kaaryakramon main se ek rahaa he

 bharat kaa angreji naam 'india' kii utpatti sindhu shabd se hui he jo unaniyon dwaara chauthi shatee isha purv se prachlan main he
 The name India derives from the 9th century in Old English and the 17th century in modern English
 bharat ko bharatvarsh 'jambudweep', bharatkhand, aryaavart, hindustan, hind aadi anya naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 According to Jainism, this country was named Bharatvarsha after the first Chakravarti Emperor Bharat Chakravarti, son of Lord Rishabhdev, son of Nabhiraj
 hindu granth, skandh puraana ke anusaar: "rishabhdev nabhiraj ke putr the, rishabh ke putr bharat the, or inke hi naam par is desh kaa naam "bharatvarsh" padaa"| Lagadha Rishi is the pioneer of Vedang astrology, the book of Vedic astrology
 inkaa kaal 1350 i pus mana jaataa he
 The time of ritual of Vedic Yajnas was used to use this book
 ise bharat main ganitiya khagolashastra par aadya kaary mana jaataa he
 a major innovation of Lagadha Rishi is the use of the date as a standard time unit
 antarrashtriya sambandh vibhinn deshon ke bich sambandhon kaa adhyayan he, saath hi saath samprabhu rajyon, antar-sarkari sanghathanon, antarrashtriya gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon, gaiyr-sarkari sanghathanon or bahurashtriya companiyon kii bhoomika kaa bhi adhyayan he
 International relations is also sometimes referred to as 'international study'), although the two terms are not entirely synonymous
 saadhaaran shabdon main 'antarrashtriya raajnneeti' kaa arth he 'rajyon ke madhya raajnneeti karnaa'
 If we study the meaning of 'politics' three major elements emerge - the existence of groups; Consent between groups; And fulfill their interests by groups
 is aashay ko yadi antarrashtriya str par akalan karen to ye teen tatv mukhya rup se - rajyon kaa astitv; rajyon ke bich sangharsh; tathaa apane rashtrahiton kii purti hetu shakti kaa prayog
 Therefore, international politics is to study the actions under which states struggle on the basis of power to fulfill their national interests
 is sandarbh main rashtriya hit antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke pramukh lakshya hote hai; sangharsh iskaa disha nirdesh tay karti he; tathaa shakti is uddeshy prapti kaa pramukh saadhan mana jaataa he
 But we can consider the above definition as traditional, because today 'international politics' has been replaced by the broader concept 'international relations'
 iske antargat rajyon ke paraspar sangharsh ke saath-saath sahyogaatmak pahaluon ko bhi ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke antargat adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Apart from this, apart from 'states', many other factors have now become the subject area of international politics
 atah iske antargat aaj vyakti, sanstha, sanghathan va kai anya gaiyr-rajya ikaiyaan bhi sammilit ho gai hai
 Its present base and subject area has taken a very wide form today
 in sabhi vishyon par charchaa se pehle alag-alag vidwaanon dwaara di gai nimna paribhaashaon kii samiksha karnaa ati anivaary ho jaataa he- The scope of these definitions is very limited, because basically 'states' have been considered as factors of international politics
 yah antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop tak hi simit he
 Mainly hannes j
 Margenthau, Harald Sprout, Bon Dyk, Thompson, etc
 are its main supporters, which is clear from their definitions- naveen paribhaashaon main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vyapak swaroop antarrashtriya sambandhon kii charchaa kii gai he
 In addition to the state, new factors of international politics such as international organizations, longitude groups, ngos, international institutions, some individuals etc
 have also been included
 iske atirikt isamen sangharsh ke saath-saath sahyog tathaa raajnneeti ke saath-saath pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup main ise prabhavit karne vaale arthath, saanskrithik, dharmik, saamaajik, vigyaan evam takniki aadi pahaluon kaa bhi ullekh kiya gaya he
 The following definitions of various authors reveal this meaning very clearly
 is prakaar antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop prarambh se vartmaan tak bahut vyapak ho jaataa he
 It has included the study of various world units and organizations along with nation states today
 parantu in sabhi parivartanon ke baad bhi in adhyayanon kaa kendra bindu aaj bhi raashtra rajya hi he
 Based on the above definitions, the following conclusions about the nature of international politics emerge
 atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop parivartansheel he
 Whenever the environment, factors and developments of international politics will change, changes in methods and approaches to study it are also inevitable
 iske atirikt, yah parivartan sthai na hokar nirantar he
 Along with this, it is very complex due to various factors, levels, dimensions, etc
 Therefore, a smooth, rational, comprehensive approach is required for its smooth study
 jaisaa uparyukt paribhaashaon evam swaroop se gyaat he ki antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa vishay kshetra badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Today its subject area has become quite extensive, under which the following things are studied: atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa vishay kshetra aaj bahut vyapak va jatil hone ke saath-saath vikaas kii ore agrasar he
 Under this, the study of various traditional factors as well as non-traditional factors is also becoming important
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas kaa itihaas zyada pracheen nahin he, balki yah vishay beesvin shatabdi kii upaj he
 Clearly, its history begins with the establishment of the international Woodrow Wilson Chair in Welles University in 1919
 is peeth par pratham asin hone vaale prasiddh itihaaskaar professor aloard jimrn the tathaa baad main anya pramukh viddhan jinhone is peeth ko sushobhit kiya unamem se pramukh the - si

 At the same time similar arrangements were seen in other universities and institutes
 atah pichhali ek shatabdi ke is vishay ke itihaas par drushtipaat karen to is vishay main aaye utaar-chadhaav ke saath-saath iske ek swytt vishay main sthapit hone ke bare main jaankaree milti he
 Multidimensional changes in this subject have helped to enhance, coordinate and develop the content on the one hand, and on the other hand by rendering various theories, it has helped in understanding many complex problems and aspects
 kenneth thampsan ne san 1962 ke 'rivyuu of politics' main prakashit apane lekh main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke itihaas ko chaar bhaagon main baanta he, jiske aadhaar par is vishay kaa suspasht evam sunishchit adhyayan sambhav ho saktaa he
 These four stages of development can also include the fifth phase of the post-cold War era
 inkaa vistrut varnan nimna prakaar se he- Before the First World War, only scholars of history, law, political science, philosophy etc
 considered different aspects of international politics
 mukhya rup se itihaaskaar hi iskaa adhyayan rajanyik itihaas tathaa anya deshon ke saath sambandhon ke itihaas ke rup main karte the
 Under this, there was an account of the work done by diplomats and foreign ministers
 atah ise kootnithik itihaas kii sangya bhi di jaati he
 According to EH Kar, before World War I, the relation of war was understood only to the soldiers and its equivalent international politics was related to diplomats
 iske atirikt, prajatantric deshon main bhi paramparaagat rup se videsh niti ko dalgat raajnneeti se alag rakhaa jaataa tha tathaa chune hue ang bhi apane aapako videshi mantralay par ankush rakhane main asamarth mahasoos karte the
 Prior to 1919, there were several major reasons for apathy towards the subject - First, till this time it was believed that war and alliance among states were as natural as poverty and unemployment
 atah yuddh, videsh niti evam rajyon ke madhya paraspar sambandhon ko roak paanaa maanviya samarthy ke vash se baahar mana jaataa tha
 Second, before World War I, wars were not so fierce
 tritiy, sanchaar sadhano ke abhaav main antarrashtriya raajnneeti kuch gine chune rajyon tak hi simit thi
 Thus the biggest shortcoming of the study of international politics in this era was the development of general interests
 is kaal main keval rajanyik itihaas kaa varnanaatmak adhyayan maatra hi hua
 As a result, it helped to understand neither the current nor future international politics
 is yug kii maatra uplabdhi 1919 main wales vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan ke peeth kii sthapana rahi
 In the period between the two world wars, two parallel currents developed
 jinamein se pratham ke antargat purv aitihaasikta ke prati prabhutv ko chhodkar samayik ghatnaon / samasyao ke adhyayan par adhik bal diya jane laga
 Along with this, an attempt has also been made to combine historical political studies with the current political contexts
 aitihaasik prabhaav ke kam hone ke baad bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan hetu ek samgr drushtikon kaa abhaav abhi bhi bana rahaa
 During this period, a lot of emphasis was placed on the study of the present, but the importance of the mutual relationship between the present and the past is still not recognized
 iske atirikt, na hi yudhottar raajnneetik samasyaon ko ateet kii tulaneey samasyaon ke saath rakhkar dekhne kaa prayaas hi kiya gaya
 Perhaps this is why even in this era two fundamental deficiencies were clearly revealed
 pratham, pehle charan kii hi bhaanti is kaal main bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti main saarvbhaumik siddhanth kaa vikaas nahin ho sakaa
 Second, even today the study of international politics could not become more explicit and rational
 is prakaar is charan main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan main bal dene kii sthiti main badlaav ke atirikt bahut zyada parivartan dekhne ko nahin mila tathaa na hi is vishay ke spasht rup se swatantra anushaasan banane kii pushti hui
 The third phase of the development of international politics was also a period between two world wars parallel to the second phase
 ise sudhaarwad kaa yug isliye kaha jaataa he ki isamen rajyon dwaara raashtra sangh kii sthapana ke kadhyam se antarrashtriya raajnneeti main sudhaar kii kalpana kii gai
 In this era, there was mainly institutional development
 is kaal ke vidwaanon, rajanyikon, rajanetaaon va chintakon kaa maananaa tha ki yadi antarrashtriya sansthaaon kaa vikaas ho jaataa he to vishwa samudaay ke sammukh upasthit yuddh va shanti kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan sambhav ho sakegaa
 For this purpose some legal and ethical approaches were structured which had the following main grounds
 inhen aadarshik evam naitik mulyon par bal dete hue antarrashtriya sanghathan kii pariklpana kii gai
 After its establishment, it was believed that the struggle to make peace between the states in international relations is over
 nai vyavastha ke antargat shakti santulan kaa koi sthaan nahin hoga
 Now the states will settle their disputes through the Union
 atah is yug main na keval yuddh va shaanti kii samasyaon kaa vivechan kiya, apitu iske doorgaami sudhaaron ke bare main bhi sochaa gaya
 Hence, the main points of the study were also to change the nature of international politics through legal problems and development of organizations
 antatah is kaal main bhavatmak, kalpanasheel va naitik sudhaarwad par adhik bal diya gaya he
 But there was always a question mark on the significance of these approaches between the World Wars
 raashtra sangh kii pratham ek dashak kii gatividhiyon se jahaan aashaa kii kiran dikhaai di, vahiin duusare dashak kii yarthathwaadee sthiti ne is dharna ko bilkul samaapt kar diya
 Non-cooperation and factionalism among the big powers gave rise to a power struggle system instead of establishing peace
 japan ne manchuriya par hamale karke jahaan shanti ko bhang kar diya vahiin italy, germany va rus ne bhi vivaadaaspad sthitiyon main na keval raashtra sangh kii sadsyta hi chodi, balki dwitiya vishwayuddh ke prarambh hone kii prakriya ko or teevr bana diya
 In this way, the world system could not run with peace, morality and law, then the realist approach was strengthened as an alternative approach due to writers like EH Kar, Shumbha, Quincy Right
 is charan main antarrashtriya raajnneeti main moolbhoot parivartanon se na keval isaki vishaywastu vyapak hui balki isamen bahut jatiltaayen bhi paidaa ho gai
 Changes in the nature of politics and the rise of new states during the Cold War era changed the entire international environment
 parinamswaroop naye upagamon, ayaamon, sansthaaon va pravritiyon kaa sarjan hua jinke madhyam se antarrashtriya sambandhon kaa adhyayan sunishchit ho gaya
 The failures of the ideal, institutional, ethical, legal and reformist streams of the earlier stages led to the development of new approaches
 yah nayaa upagam tha-yatharthwaad
 Although EH Karr, Schwarzenberger, Quincy Right, Shubhan etc
 developed this approach, but Hanes J
 Margenthau presented it as a general principle
 is siddhanth ke anusaar rajya hameshaa apane hiton kii purti hetu sangharshrat rahete hai
 Therefore, to understand international politics, it is very important to understand the various aspects of this power struggle
 yathartwaadee drushtikon ke saath antarrashtriya sansthaaon ke sunishchit va suspasht vikaas ke rup main antarrashtriya sanghathan kii bhi utpatti hui
 Now the form of this organization emerged as an important political organization rather than an idealistic and reformist
 iske antargat maanavjaati ko yuddh kii vibheeshikaa se bachaane ke saath-saath rajyon ke madhya sangharsh ke koun-koun se kaaran hai? vishvashanti hetu khatre ke koun-koun se kaarak hai? shanti kii sthapana kaise ho sakati he? shastron kii hode ko kaise roka ja saktaa he? aadi kai prakaar ke prashnon kaa samaadhaan dhundne ke prayaas bhi kiye gaye
 Along with the above two trends, the origin of behaviorism was also an important achievement of this era
 vyavahaaravaadi drushtikon ke madhyam se ”vyavastha siddhanth“ kii utpatti kar antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Under this approach, it is considered necessary to study three major factors for the study of states
 ye kaarak the- The main force of the above trends has been to promote the ideology of international politics
 atah is yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke saarvbhaumik siddhanton kaa pratipaadan karnaa ati mahatvapurn kaary rahaa he
 As a result of this process of theory formation, many partial theories like - realism, theory of balance, communication theory, sports theory, bargaining theory, peace research approach, system theory, world order model etc
 were created
 in siddhanton ke pratipaadan ke baavjood is yug main kisi ek saarvbhaumik va saamaanya siddhanth kaa abhaav abhi bhi bana rahaa
 In the 1990s, Jayant Bandhopadhyay, in his book - General Theory of International Relations - has tried to overcome the shortcomings of Martin Kaplan's administrative theory, but he is still in a period of debate
 atah saiddhantikaran ke mukhya daur ke baavjood shityudh kaaleen yug apni vaicharik sankeernata va algaav ke kaaran kisi ek saamaanya siddhanth ke pratipaadan se vanchit rahaa
 In the post-cold War era, all nations started joining together under one economic system
 isiilie ab vaishvikaran, udaarikaran, mukt bazaar vyavastha aadi kaa daur prarambh ho gaya
 In this context, not only the importance of economic issues increased, but the importance of international politics also increased
 aaj rashtriyata evam antarrashtriyata kaa vibhed samaapt ho gaya iske atirikt, ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii vishay suchi main kaaphi naveen vishyon kaa samavesh ho gaya jo rashtriya na rahakar ab maanavjaati kii samasyaon ke rup main ubhar kar aaye
 Among the major problems of the current world, terrorism, environment, depletion of ozone layer, trafficking of drugs and drugs, human rights abuses etc
, major issues have emerged which have become mandatory to solve at international level rather than at national level or regional level
 
 saiddhanthik str par bhi 1945 se 1991 tak ke saarvbhaumik siddhanth kii sthapana ke prayaas ko dhakka laga
 Priorities in this context of international politics have now changed
 uttar-aadhuniktawaad main ab saarvbhaumik siddhanton kii sarthakata par prashn chihn lag rahe hai
 The influence of historical context and ancient environment is also being denied
 ab swatantra mudde adhik mahatvapurn ho gaye hai
 Great principles have become secondary
 nae sandarbh main aanshik shodh adhik mahatvapurn ban gai he
 For example, with more emphasis on the topics of feminism, human rights, environment etc
, thinking has also started
 atah shityudhottar yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop, vishay suchi evam vishay kshetra purna rup se parivartit ho gaye hai
 Now too much emphasis is not being laid on the general theoretical establishment
 isiilie is badale hue parivesh main antarrashtriya raajnneeti mahatvapurn hi nahin, apitu swaittata kii ore agrasar prathit ho rahi he
 And there are optimistic signs for the subject's autonomy
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ne na keval antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko moolbhoot rup main prabhavit kiya apitu kai mahatvapurn muddon kii abhivyakti bhi kii
 Changes in the factors of international politics, broadening of factors, rendering of new principles etc
 Apart from many topics, the entire environment of international politics has changed itself
 jahaan ek ore saiddhanthik str par yatharthwaad va adarshavaad ke vaad-vivaad tathaa pracheen va vaigyaniktaa par vaad-vivaad ho rahaa he, vahiin duusari ore vyavhaarik str par antarrashtriya sambandh vishay ke praaroop ke bare main vivaadaaspad prashn uth rahe the ki - kya antarrashtriya sambandh ek swytt vishay he yaa nahin? yadhyapi aaj adhiktar vishvavidhyalayon main snaatak va snatakottar staron par tathaa shodh hetu yah ek swytt vishay ke rup main padhaayaa ja rahaa he, tathaapi ise saamaajik vigyaan ke anya vishyon ke samakaksh manyata nahin mili he
 It has so much happened that in developed countries, it is being taught as a completely autonomous subject in many universities
 bharat jaise vikasshil deshon main bhi sudhaar hua he
 Initially here 'indian School of International Relations, New Delhi' which later on autonomously functions as the School of International Relations at Jawaharlal Nehru University
 iske atirikt kai anya vishvavidhyalayon jaise jadavapur vishvavidhyalay, kalakatta, goa vishvavidhyalay aadi main bhi ab ise swytt vishay kaa darja mila he
 Before studying international relations as an autonomous subject, it is necessary to clarify one thing that when we study the question of autonomy of this subject, 'international politics' and international relations are not considered as separate subjects
 yah isliye kiya gaya he ki donon hi vishyon ko abhi swytt anushaasan na maanakar raajnneetishastra vishay ke ek up-anushaasan ke rup main hi manyata praapt he
 Secondly, the distinction is so subtle that this subject can be resolved after authenticating the autonomy of the discipline
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko swytt vishay maanane ke sandarbh main teen pruthak-pruthak vichaar die gaye hai jo nimna prakaar se hai - According to scholars who consider this subject as autonomous, it should be considered as an autonomous subject given the content and discipline related content of international politics

 These scholars have certified it as an autonomous subject on the following grounds: jo vidwaan antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko ek swytt vishay nahin maanate unka maananaa yah he ki is vishay main aisi koi vilakshan vastu nahin he ki ise adhyayan hetu swytt mana jaae
 He has supported his point on the basis of the following arguments- kuch vidwaan uparyukt donon prakaar kii bahes ko nirarthak maanate hai
 They believe that both of the above arguments can be better understood through the development in international politics
 atah 20veen shatabdi main, or visheshkar 1945 ke baad, ke vikaas kii samiksha ati anivaary he
 If we study deeply the question of autonomy of international politics, then it is known that two fundamental problems have to be faced in this context
 ek to antarrashtriya sambandh ke swaroop, vishaywastu va adhyayan ke tareekon main prabhavi parivartan aaye hai
 Second, at the same time, the problem has increased further due to the complexities of political science and the development of undefined boundaries
 lekin 1919 se aaj tak ke antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas par nazar daalen to spasht hota he ki isaki uplabdhiyaan ise swaittata dilaane main kaaphi sahaayak siddh hongi
 Since 1919, especially in America, many scholars have tried to make this subject more and more scientific
 iske vishay vastu, tareekon evam siddhanth ko suspasht karne ke prayaas bhi hue hai
 These authors mainly include Paul, Rines, Bern, James Bright, Hubert, Givens, Raymond Wull, Parker, Moon, Shubhan, Alford Jimene, E

 Several scholars in America, mainly Maranthau, Richard Snyder, Martin Kaplan, Carl W
 Doyce, Charles mcclelland, have made specific contributions in this regard
 iske atirikt viksit va vikasshil donon deshon ke adhyayan par bal diya he
