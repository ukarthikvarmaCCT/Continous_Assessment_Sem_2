 On 17 December 2009, Australia vs West Indies, in the third Test match, Chris Gayle scored the fifth fastest century in the history of Test matches
 He scored a century in just 70 balls
 haalanki, uske kuch hi samay baad unhen 102 ran par khaarij kar diya gaya
 There was a stir of runs in this performance thanks to some big sixes
 One of these six hit a terrible hit on the roof of the Lily Marsh stand, which was estimated to be about 140 meters long by the circleer Eian Hiely

 In the 2009 World Twenty20 semi-final match against Sri Lanka, he became the first international player to hold his bat during the entire innings in this format of the game
 In April 2008, Gayle was auctioned by the Kolkata Knight Riders special selling rights of the Indian Premier League, but was unable to participate in the opening games due to his tour to Sri Lanka in the Caribbean
 When he finally joined the team, he could not play due to a back ache that arose during his tour
 Later, he left for a home series against Australia and left to join the West Indies team and therefore did not play at all in the inaugural edition of the IPL
 1 july 2009 ko, gail ne big bash naamak ek australian gharelu twanti-20 toornament ke liye western australia varirs ke saath 2009-10 sizan ke liye sin kiya
 His potential salute partnership with Adam Gilchrist would be disastrous for his opponents

 However, Gayle scored 88 to win the match in the first official match of the 2009 Twenty20 and a surprise win over Australia
 ek shant, dhairypurna cricketer ke rup main dekhe jane ke baavjood, gail kuch vivaadon main shaamil hai
 In 2005, Gayle was involved in a dispute between the West Indies Cricket Board and several players over sponsorship issues
 cabel and wireles, jo west indies cricket kaa praayojan karata tha; uske saath in khilaadiyon kaa vyaktigat praayojan sauda tha
 However, since the West Indies were recently sponsored by cable and wireless rival Digicel, the West Indies Cricket Board demanded that players give up their cable and wireless deal
 When the players refused to leave it, the West Indies Cricket Board excluded him from the first Test match against South Africa
 Gayle later ended his deal with Cable and Wireless and rejoined the team for the second Test
 2006 main newjiland ke khilaaf ek test match ke dauraan un par cricket kii bhaavana ke vipareet vyavhaar karne kaa aarope lagaaya gaya, magar baad main paaya gaya ki vah doshi nahin the
 Later that year, during the October Champions Trophy in India, he was fined 30 per cent of his match fees due to recurring verbal conversations with Australian batsman Michael Clarke
 He also publicly criticized the West Indies Cricket Board during a tour of England in 2007, which led to an official reprimand and warning
 2009 ke prarambh main west indies ke england daure ke dauraan bhi gail kii aalochana kii gai, jaha unhone kaha ki kuch dabaavon ke chalate vah ab west indies kii captaini nahin karnaa chaahate or bhavishya main yadi twanti-20 test cricket kii jagah le letaa he to vah "itane dukhi nahin honge"
 west indies se viv richards or gairi sobers donon ne gail kii tippaniyon kii aalochana kii, jaisaa ki unke virdohi andrew straas ne bhi kiya
 Gayle later stated that his statement was cited out of context, according to West Indies Cricket Board Chairman, Julian Hunt
 england ke daure main west indies kii haar ke nishkarsh par maaikel atharton ke saath ek saakshaatkaar main gail ne kaha ki vah captaini se istipha nahin de rahe

 Zionism or totalism is the philosophical, religious or spiritual idea that the soul is not only in humans but also in all animals, flora, rocks, natural phenomena
 isse bhi aage jaakar kabhi-kabhi shabdon, naamon, upamaaon, rupakon aadi main bhi aatma ke astitv kii baat kahi jaati he
 The philosophy of totalitarianism is found mainly in tribal societies, but it is also found in some sects of Shinto and Hindus
 aatma, jeevatma yaa jeev ke vishay main manushyon main praaia: teen prakaar ke vishwaas yaa vichaar prachlit rahe hai
 Some people, like the followers of Charvak, believe nothing independent of bodies or separate beings or spirits
 unke anusaar chetana jad mastishk kii kriyaaon ke parinamswaroop usee prakaar utpann ho jaati he jis prakaar ki yakrut se pitt; vah kisi jeev yaa aatma naamak abhautik tatv yaa padaarth kaa gun yaa swaroop nahin
 Against this, in the view of some people, consciousness does not originate from material elements, but from physical substances, it is the quality of a unique soul or creature
 udhaaharan ke liye, jain vichaarkon ne jeevon ke swatantra astitv ko sweekaar karte hue jeev kii paribhaasha "chetnalakshano jeev:" in shabdon main kii he
 But not everyone who accepts the power of soul or organism is of a single opinion
 unhen sthool rup se do virgon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 One is that only those who accept the existence of the soul only in humans and some high-ranking animals and secondly, not only in humans and animals, but also in insects, moths and plants, which others consider to be the root
 Believe in the existence of soul or organism
 maanvon ke isi prakaar ke vishwaas yaa vichaar ko sarvatmavaad naam diya jaataa he
 In logical language, animism is the principle according to which even the so-called root substances accept the existence of a non-physical element or power called soul or spirit and it is considered not only the basis of intellectual life of intellectual beings but also of physical or material actions
 
 jaisaa kathopanishad "yonimanye prapadyante shariratvaay dehin: sthanumanyenusyati yathakarm yathashrutam" ke is shruti se evam shrimadbhagwat ke "andeshu peshish tarushvanishchiteshu praano hi jeevamupadhavati tatra tatra " is shloke se tathaa shri umaswami ke tatwarthadhigmasutra ke "vanaspatyantanamekam" is vaakya se vidit hota he, bhartiya aastik vichaarak tathaa jain darshanik donon hi vanaspati aadi sthavar tathaa pruthivi aadi jangam jad padaarthon main bhi aatma kaa astitv maanate rahe hai
 Hence, he can be called a proponent of totalitarian thought
 vastut: vriksh, grah, upgrahadi achetan padaartho main bhi aatma yaa jeev kii satta par aasthaa rakhanevaale vyakti ab bhi sansar ke gayana aadi anek deshon main paae jate hai jo praaia: na keval pretatmaon kii, visheshtya apane mrit purvajon kii, apitu aisi atmaaon kii bhi puja karte hai jinhen ve yaa to kisi bhi sharir yaa vastu vishesh se sambandhit nahin samajhate yaa phir prakritik padaarthon ke adhishthata athwa abhimaani devataaon ke rup main sweekaar karte hai
 Most thinkers of the modern era understand the fundamental belief not only of multi-theism but also of the virtuous monotheism of good human beings and count it in the religion or philosophy of uncivilized or half-castes
 unke anusaar sarvatmavaad maanav kii ek avaigyanik aasthaa maatr he
 They consider it an intellectual attempt to explain the facts of the world; But only initial or immature efforts

 "bluetooth is defined as a layer protocol architecture that includes the core protocol, cable replacement protocol, telephony control protocol, and adoption protocol
 sabhi Bluetooth stack ke liye anivaary protocol hai: LMP, L2CAP or SDP
 iske atirikt, ye protocol lagbhag saarvbhaumik samarthit hai: HCI or RFCOMM
 Used to control the radio link between two devices
 niyantrak par lagu kiya gaya
 Used for multidimensional multi-logical combinations using different high level protocols between two devices
 on-air provides partitioning and reintegration of packets
 mul mod main L2CAP, 64kb tak kaa ek pelod vinyas ke saath, difolt MTU ke rup main 672 bite ke saath or anivaary nunatam samarthit MTU ke rup main 48 bite ke packet pradaan karata he
 In retransmission and flow control mode, L2CAP can be created by editing the recirculation and CRC probes for reliable or timed data per channel
 Bluetooth kor vinirdesan parishisht 1, do atirikt L2CAP mod kor vinirdesan main jodta he
 These modes effectively oppose the original recirculation and flow control modes: inamen se kisi bhi mod main vishwasaneeyata vaikalpik or / yaa Bluetooth BDR / EDR vaayu antarafalak kii nichali parat dwaara punarsancharan kii sankhya ke vinyas or flush timeout dwaara atirikt guarantee yukt he
 Proper serialization is guaranteed by the lower level
 keval ERTM yaa SM main vinyast L2CAP channel AMP taarkik link par sanchalit kiye ja sakate hai
 It is used to allow devices to find each other's supported services and what criteria to use to connect to them
 udhaaharan ke liye, jab ek mobile phone ko Bluetooth hedset ke saath joda jaataa he, to SDP kaa prayog yah nishchit karne ke liye hoga ki koun si Bluetooth ruparekhaayen hedset dwaara samarthit hai or protocol bahusanketak yojana ko uname se prayek ke saath judane kii zarurat he
 Each service is identified by a global peer identifier, an abbreviated form UUID assigned with government services
 mejabaan stack or niyantrak ke bich manakikrut sanchaar
yah maanak mejabaan stack yaa niyantrak IC ko nunatam anukulan ke saath adla-badali karne kii anumati detaa he
 The HCI transport layer standard is multiple and each uses a different hardware interface to transfer the same commands, events, and data packets
 sabase adhik istemaal hota he USB or UART kaa
 In a Bluetooth device with simple functionality, the host stack and controller can be implemented on the same microprocessor
 is maamle main HCI vaikalpik he, haalanki aksar ek aantarik software antarafalak ke rup main lagu kiya jaataa he
 Radio frequency communication is a cable replacement protocol used to create a virtual serial data stream
 RFCOMM dwiadhari data parivahan ke liye pradaan karata he or Bluetooth aadharband parat ke upar EIA-232 niyantran sanket kii barabari karata he
 RFCOMM provides the user with a simple reliable data flow similar to TCP
 yah pratyaksh rup se kai telephoni sambandhit ruparekha dwaara AT adeshon ke liye ek vaahak ke taur par prayog kiya jaataa he saath hi saath Bluetooth par OBEX ke liye ek parivahan parat ke rup main bhi
 Many Bluetooth specifications use RFCOMM due to its extensive support and publicly available apis on most operating systems
 iske atirikt, anuprayog jo samvaad ke liye kramik port kaa upyog karte the, RFCOMM kaa upyog karne ke liye tunrat parivartit kiye ja sakate hai
 BNEP is used to transfer data to another protocol stack through an L2CAP channel
 iskaa mukhya uddeshy nijee kshetra netwarking ruparekha main IP packet kaa sancharan he
 BNEP performs the same function with SNAP in wireless lans
 remote control ruparekha dwaara AV / c adeshon ko ek L2CAP channel par sthaanantarit karne ke liye prayukt
ek sterio hedset par sangeet niyantran batan is protocol kaa upyog sangeet vaadya ko niyantrit karne ke liye karte hai
 It is used by the Advanced Audio Distribution Framework to send music to a stereo headset over an L2CAP channel
 drishy vitaran ruparekha dwaara upyog kii sambhaavna
 Telephony Control protocol-binary is a bit-oriented protocol that defines the call control signal between Bluetooth devices to establish voice and data calls
 iske atirikt, "TCS BIN gatishiltaa prabandhan prakriya ko Bluetooth TCS upkarnon ke samooh ko sanbhaalane ke liye paribhaashit karata he
 " TCS-BIN sirf betaar telephoni ruparekha dwaara hi upyog kiya jaataa he, jo paripalkon ko aakarshith karne main vifal rahaa he
 Thus, it is of historical importance only
 dattak protocol anya maanak-nirmaataa sanghathanon dwaara paribhaashit kiya gaya he or Bluetooth ko, keval jab aavashyaktaa ho, protocol nirmaan karne kii anumati dete hue, Bluetooth ke protocol stack main shaamil kiya gaya he
 Adoption protocols include: ek swami Bluetooth upkaran, betaar prayokta samooh main saat upkarnon ke saath baatcheet kar saktaa he
 This network cluster of up to eight devices is called a piconet
 ek piconut ek tadarth computer network he, jo Bluetooth takanic protocol kaa upyog karte hue ek swami upkaran ko saat sakriy upkarnon tak ke saath sambandh rakhane kii anumati detaa he
 Up to 255 devices can remain inactive or standing which the master device can bring to active state at any time
 die gaye kisi bhi samay main, data swami or ek anya upkaran ke bich sthanantarit kiya ja saktaa he, haalanki vah upkaran bhoomikaaon main parivartan kar saktaa he or gulam kisi bhi samay swami ban saktaa he
 The master rapidly moves from one instrument to another in a round-robin fashion
 Bluetooth vinirdesan kuch upkarnon ke ek hi saath ek piconut main swami or duusare main gulam kii bhoomika adaa kar ke ek sethu ke rup main kaary karte hue, ek scaternet banane ke liye do yaa do se adhik piconut ko ek saath jodne kii anumati detaa he
 There are several USB Bluetooth adapters available, some of which also include the irda adapter
 sirf Bluetooth gananaakaar or ek kam shaktishaalee Bluetooth radio avatar dete hue, isse puraane Bluetooth anukulak main haalanki sirf simit sevaayen hai
 Such devices can link computers to Bluetooth, but they do not offer much like the services of modern adapters
 Bluetooth system main teen prakaar ke truti sudhaar lagu kiye gaye hai, Any Bluetooth device will transmit the following information on demand: koi bhi upkaran sangyojan ke liye anya upkaran kii jaanch kar saktaa he or kisi bhi upkaran ko aisi jaanch kaa uttar dene ke liye sanrachit kiya ja saktaa he
 However, if the device attempting the combination knows the address of the other device, it always responds directly to the connection request and transmits the information displayed above, if requested
 ek upkaran kii sevaaon ke prayog ko jodi yaa uske swami kii sweekruti kii zarurat pad sakati he, par apane aap main sangyojan kisi bhi upkaran dwaara shuru kiya ja saktaa he or jab tak vah pahunch ke baahar nahin ho jaataa, bana rah saktaa he
 Some devices can connect with one device at a time, and a combination of them prevents them from connecting to another device and joining the probe until they are separated from the other device
 prayek upkaran kaa ek anupam 48-bit pataa he
 However these addresses are not usually shown in the test
 Instead, friendly Bluetooth names, which can be set by the user, are used
 yugal upkarnon kii suchi main or jab ek anya upyogkarta upkarnon ke liye jaanch karata he to yah naam prakat hota he
 Most phones' Bluetooth names are based on the manufacturer and model of the phone by default
 zyaadaatar phone or laptop keval Bluetooth naam darshaate hai or sudur upkarnon kii atirikt jaankaree praapt karne ke liye vishesh kaaryakramon kii aavashyaktaa he
 This can be confusing, for example, many phones named T610 may be in range
 upkarnon kii jodiyaan, link kunjee ke naam se saajha rahasy rach kar rishta sthapit kar sakati hai, is prakriya ko yugman ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 If a link key is stored by both devices, they are called strings
 ek upkaran jo sirf anubaddh upkaran ke saath baatcheet karnaa chahta he vah duusare upkaran kii pahchaan ko kuta lekhan ke aadhaar par pramanit kar saktaa he or is prakaar vah sunishchit kar saktaa he ki yah vahi upkaran he jiske saath usne pehle jodi banaai thi
 Once a link key is generated, an authenticated ACL link between devices can be encoded so that the data that they exchanged over air waves is protected against eavesdropping
 link kunjiyaan kisi bhi samay donon upkarnon dwaara mitaai ja sakati hai, donon main se kisi bhi upkaran dwaara yadi yah kiya jaataa he to yah nihsandeh upkarnon ke bich ke jod ko samaapt kar degaa; to yah sambhav he ki ek upkaran link kunji ko surakshit rakhe magar is baat kaa gyaan naa ho ki vah link kunjee se jude upkaran se ab aabaddh nahin he
 Bluetooth services usually require encryption or authentication, although pairing is required before allowing the remote device to use the given service
 kuch sevaayen, jaise object push profil, kutalekhan yaa pramanikaran kii spasht rup se zarurat naa padane kaa chunaav karti hai taaki yugman is seva ke prayog se jude maamalon main upyogkarta ke anubhav ke saath hastkshep nahin kare
 The pairing mechanisms have changed significantly since the introduction of secure normal pairing in Bluetooth 2

 yugman tantra ko nimnlikhit sankshepit karata he: SSP is considered easy for the following reasons: link kunjee ko upkaran file pranali par sangrakshit karnaa chahie or naa ki Bluetooth chip par hi
kai Bluetooth chip nirmaataa link kunjee ko upkaran par sangrakshit karne kii anumati dete hai; phir bhi yadi upkaran hataae jane yogya he to iskaa matlab yah he ki link kunjee bhi upkaran ke saath chalanshil hogi
 This protocol operates in the license-free ISM band at 2
4–2
4835 ghz
 anya protocol ke saath jo 2
45 ghz band kaa upyog karte hai, hastkshep se bachane ke liye Bluetooth protocol, band ko 79 channelon main vibhajit karata he or channel ko prati second main 1600 baar parivartit karata he
 Implementation with versions 1

 Technically, version 2
0 devices have a higher energy consumption but effectively reduce transmission times by three times faster than 1
x devices by half the energy consumption
 Bluetooth, SAFER+ block bijlekh par aadhaarit custom kalanvidhi ke saath gopneeyata, pramanikaran or kunjee vyutpatti aujaar kriyanvit karata he
 In Bluetooth, key generation is usually based on a Bluetooth PIN, which must be entered on both devices
 yah prakriya sanshodhit kii ja sakati he agar donon main se ek upkaran main ek nirdisht PIN ho yugman ke dauraan, E22 elgorithm kaa upyog kar ke ek prarambhikaran kunjee yaa swami kunjee utpann hoti he
 The E0 stream cipher is used for encrypting packets, providing confidentiality, and is based on a shared cryptographic secret, ie a pre-generated link key or owner key
 ve kunjiyaan jo air interphes maarg se data ke anuvarthi kutalekhan ke liye prayukt hoti hai, Bluetooth pin, jo ek yaa donon upkarnon main darj kiya gaya he, par nirbhar karti hai
 An overview of Bluetooth vulnerabilities exploits has been published by Andreas Becker
 sitambar 2008 main rashtriya maanak or praudyogiki santhaan ne Bluetooth suraksha par ek guide prakashit kii, jo Bluetooth kii suraksha kshamtaaon or Bluetooth takneekon ko prabhavi dhang se praapt karne ke liye sanghathanon ke liye sandarbh ke rup main kaam karegi
 Although Bluetooth has its advantages, it is vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, eavesdropping, middle-of-the-person attacks, message modification, and resource misappropriation
 upyogkarta / sanghathanon ko apane jokhim uthaane ke str kaa moolyankan zarur karnaa chahie or suraksha ko Bluetooth upkarnon ke jivan chakra main shaamil karnaa chahie
 The NIST documentation includes a list of security checks, including guidelines, and recommendations for the creation and protection of secure Bluetooth piconets, headsets, and smart card readers, to help reduce risks
 ek upyogkarta dwaara duusare bekhbar upyogkarta ko Bluetooth betaar takanic ke madhyam se ek chitra yaa ek sandesh bhejne ko bluejekking kehete hai
 Common applications include short messages
 bluejaik main upkaran se kisi data kaa mitna yaa parivartit hona shaamil nahin he
 In 2001, Jacobson and Vatsel of Bell Laboratories discovered a flaw in Bluetooth's pairing protocol and also identified weaknesses in the coding scheme
 november 2003 main, AL digital Ltd
 ke ben or adam lorie ne khoja ki Bluetooth suraksha main gambhir khami vyaktigat aankado kaa khulaasa kar sakati he
 However, it should be noted that the reported security problems were related to some poor implementation of Bluetooth rather than protocol

 a new attack called Bluebug was used for this experiment
 Bluetooth sanchaar kii suraksha par uthaai gai chintaaon main se yah ek he
 The first alleged virus to spread among mobile phones using Bluetooth appeared on Symbian OS in 2004
 This virus was first defined by Kaspersky Lab and requires the user to confirm the installation of unknown software before its spread
 yah virus "29A" naam ke ek virus lekhak samooh dwaara ek avadharana-kaa-saboot likhaa gaya or ise virus virdohi samoohon ko bheja gaya
 Therefore, it should be considered a potential threat to Bluetooth or Symbian OS security as this virus never spread outside the system

 In establishing contact, the attacker must be able to obtain information from the victim
 ek Bluetooth upkaran ke khilaaf koi hamalaa tab tak nahin kiya ja saktaa jab tak ki hamalavar ko Bluetooth kaa pataa or sanchaarit kiye jane vaale channel ki jaankaree na ho
 In January 2005, a mobile malfunctioning bug known as LASCO
A began targeting mobile phones from Bluetooth-enabled devices using Symbian OS to extend themselves and spread to other devices

 april 2005 main, cambridge vishvavidhyalay ke suraksha shodhakartaaon ne vanijyik Bluetooth upkarnon ke madhya PIN aadhaarit yugman ke khilaaf niskriy hamalon ke vaastavik kriyanvayan ke apane nirnyon ko prakashit kiya or ye pusht kiya ki hamale vyaavhaarik rup se tej hai or Bluetooth samroop kunjee sthapana vidhi kamazor he
 To remedy this weakness, they started an implementation that showed that strong, homogeneous critical installation is possible for certain classes of devices, such as mobile phones
 Bluetooth link ke liye pin praapt karne ke liye niskriy or sakriy donon vidhiyon kaa varnan karte hue june 2005 main yaniv shaked or avishai wool ne ek paper prakashit kiya
 Passive attack allows a suitably armed attacker to eavesdrop on communication and parody if the attacker was present during the initial pairing
 yah sakriy vidhi, swami or gulam ko yugman prakriya ko dohraane ke liye ek vishesh rup se nirmit sandesh jo protocol main ek khaas bindu par daalaa janaa chahie, kaa upyog karti he
 After that, the first method can be used for PIN penetration

 In practice, the term "cell culture" refers to the cultivation of cells that are derived from multicellular eukaryotes, especially from animal cells
 However, plants, fungi and germs also grow, including viruses, bacteria and protists
 The historical development and methods of cell culture are closely related to tissue culture and organ culture
 pashu koshika sanvardhan, madhya 1900 main ek aam prayogshaala takanic ban gai, lekin mul utak strot se alag kii gai sajiv koshika pankti ko banaae rakhane kii avadharana kaa avishkaar 19veen sadi main hua

 Alternative strategies include importing blood from countries where there is minimal risk of BSE / TSE, such as Australia and New Zealand and the use of pure nutrient extract extracted from the serum in place of complete animal serum for cell culture
 plating ghanatv kuch prakaar ke koshika ke liye ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 For example, a low-density plating granulosa induces cells to produce estrogen, while a higher plating density displays them as progesterone producing theca lutein cells
 koshika ko nilamban yaa anubaddh sanvardhanon main viksit kiya ja saktaa he
 Some cells naturally remain in suspension without attaching to the surface, such as those cells present in the bloodstream

 Some players, such as jazz fusion bassist Jaco Pastorius, are known to have traction near the bridge, where the string is the most tight, while other bassists prefer to traction on the loose part of the string near the fingerprint
 kai besavadak dabl base kii dhvaniyon kaa anukaran karne ke liye anguuthe se tantriyon kaa karshan karte hai or "thampi" swar utpann karne ke liye hatheli se tantri ko mook karte hai
 The late Monk Montgomery and Bruce Palmer used the thumb

 Contrary to its name, it was not used to give the thumb a rest, but rather as a support for the thumb during traction of the strings
 1970 ke dashakon ke modelon main thambrest tantriyon ke upar le jaaya gaya tha or 1980 ke dashak main hataa hi diya diya
 The slap and pop method, or "thumb style", is most associated with funk and produces vocal and shock tones by thrashing, thumping or slapping on the string with the thumb or snapping through the forefinger or middle
 besavadak teevr aghati prabhaav ke liye aksar baayen haath se mook kiye gaye "mrit swaron" kaa slap or pop ke bich main antarveshan karte hai or swar ko slap yaa pop kiye jane ke baad frating hand se "haimer on", "pul of" yaa ek baayen haath ke glissando ke dwaara anya swar utpann kiye jate hai

 pick ko aamtaur par anguuthe or tarjani se pakadaa jaataa he kalai kii upar-neeche gati ke saath pluking kii jaati he
 Many types of pick are available, but due to the thick and heavy strings of the electric bass, bassists prefer to use the heavier pick than the pick used for electric guitars
 pick ke liye vibhinn samagriyon jaise plastic, nylon or felt jo sabhi bhinn bhinn swar utpann karte hai, kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Felt pick is used to simulate a fingerstyle tone

 On the other hand, the resonant resonance of the corresponding string may be needed for a song, such as a song-song
 In these cases, a bassist can harmonically fret related vocals
 udhaaharan ke liye, jabaki ek nirantar "epa" bajaayaa jaataa he, neeche ek epa sargam ek piano khilaadi dwaara bajaayaa ja rahaa he, ek besavadak is sur ke neeche 'si' or neeche 'epa' ko pakad saktaa he jisase unke guneet swaron kii anukanpi dhwani nikalati he

 For fretless basses, players can use this style of vibrato or they can replay between the tone and a slightly lower pitch
 jabaki prakampan zyaadaatar "roke gaye" swaron- arthath ve swar jinhen angulipatal par dabaaya gaya he- khuli tantriyon ko bhi tantri ko nat ke peeche dabaa kar prakampit kiya ja saktaa he
 Also, the fretting hand can be used to "bend" a pluck or picketed tone upward
 ek vipareet prabhaav "bend down" utpann karne ke liye, plak yaa pick karne se pehle tantri ko oonchi tarata tak dhakela jaataa he or tab bajane ke baad ise niyamit tarata tak girane diya jaataa he

 Jazz bassists use Pizzicato, a subtle form of the fretting hand, by plucking a very brief particle tone from the fretting hand onto the opening string just before the plucking hand is played
 jab ek tantri par teji se hamering kii jaati he, swar ko ek tril main lambey samay tak vilambit kiya ja saktaa he
 In two-hand tapping styles, bassists use both hands to quickly press and hold the strings on the screen
 is takanic main, dhwani utpann karne ke liye tantri ke pluking yaa picking kii bajaay tantri ko fret yaa fretboard se takaraakar dhwani utpann kii jaati he

 When a gas is lit, according to Kirkhhoff's theory, it radiates only the light of particular characters, not radiating white light
 in varnon ko gas ke lakshanik varna kehete hai
 Which characters will appear in these colors, if they emit white light from the radiant gas in that physical state, then the spectrum of white light does not become black, but the characteristic characters of the gas are absent in it

 The light that comes from celestial bodies is produced in its internal parts, yet nothing can be said about the composition of those parts with the help of spectroscopy
 vah to keval in pindon ko ghere hue gasmandal ke vishay main hi soochna dene main samarth he
 As a result, to know about the composition and physical state of the internal parts of these bodies, different means are needed from spectral spectra

 Kirkhhoff and Belfur and Stuart have proved that if the energy of a body does not change, each character has its radiation and absorption volumes in a particular ratio
 krishna shabd kaa pind ke drishy rang se koi sambandh nahin he
 Theoretical, or experimental, studies of such bodies have proved that the intensity of each color is fixed at a particular temperature
 plank ne ooshmaagatiki ke aadhaar par ek sutara kaa pratipaadan kiya he, jo yah bataata he ki ooshmaa gatikeey samya kii avasthaa main adarsh krishna pind ke amuk varna ke vikiran kii amuk tivrata hoti he
 The diagram above shows the relationship between wavelength and radiation intensity
 pind ke die hue taap ke liye vakr or tarangadaidhray ke aksh ke madhya main simit kshetrafal us sampurna urja ko nishchit karata he jiskaa vikiran tara akaash main prati kshan kar rahaa he
 It is also clear from these curves that along with the change in temperature of the body there is also a change in the wavelength of maximum intensity
 vastut: jyon jyon pind ke taap main vruddhi hoti jaati he, mahattam tivrata kaa tarangadaidhray ghatata jaataa he, arthath vah varnakram main drishy bhaag kii ore hatataa jaataa he
 According to Planck's rule for the ideal Krishna body, the formula for revealing the relation of heat and maximum intensity of wavelength is easily determined
 at: taare ke prabhavi taap ko nishchit karne ke liye pehle uske varnakram ke adhyayan se mahattam tivrata ke vikiran kaa tarangadaidhray gyaat kiya jaataa he
 The effective temperature of the star is actually the temperature of that ideal Krishna body whose maximum intensity of radiation is in the same wavelength as that of the star

 In the last century, many astrologers tried to classify stars with the idea of alphabetical order, but the prevailing classification was done in the first years of the current century by Professor Mickering, Mrs
 Fleming and Kumari Kennan at the Harvard Wageshala
 is vargeekaran main kuch aksharon kaa prayog kiya gaya he, jinke varan kaa suvidha ke atirikt or koi vishesh vaigyanik aadhaar nahin he
 The main classes of this classification are marked with O, B, A, F, C, a and M
 For convenience, each of these classes is divided into ten subclasses
 vyavhaar main taare ke varg kaa nishchay uske varncrampatt kii pramukh avasorana rekhaon kii tivrata ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he, jo taap evam daab donon par nirbhar karti hai
 Therefore, the effect of temperature and pressure is considered in the classification in such a way that most of the stars can be divided into two main categories: massive stars and vamana stars and then the intensity of absorption lines in each range varies so regularly that the given intensities For the class of stars, consequently its effective temperature, can be decided exclusively

 Surya is a member of Vamana category
 nimnaankit sarini main in virgon se sangat vaaman shrenee ke taron ke liye prabhavi taap evam varncrampatt kii vishetaayen di gai he: Later on, in order to include the nonspecific observed strings in the classification, at the beginning of this classification, the sum of squares and at the end, n and r were used, and the resulting classification is as follows: varnakramiki ke saadhan ne yah bhi prakat kiya ki bahut se taare, jo bade se bade doordarshee dwaara liye gaye photographon main akele dikhaai dete hai, vastav main do taare hai, jo apane gurutvakentre kii parikrama karte rahete hai
 These stars are called spectral coupler stars

 This is called the Geman effect
 babakaak ne kuch taron ke varncrampatton main is prabhaav ko vidyaman paaya, jiske aadhaar par usne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki in taron main surya kii bhanti chumbakeey kshetra vidyaman he
 The space between the stars is not completely lacking in substance
 vahaan atyant visarit dhuli tathaa pindkhand vidyaman hai
 For example, in the galaxy, about 25 nodules of radius 10–5 cm per cubic cm are found, one hydrogen atom per cubic cm, and 10–5 cm per cubic km
 is prakaar is sthaan main sthit padaarth kaa ghanatv lagbhag 3n10-24 gram prati ghan senmi0 he
 The density of matter in the star gases is almost the same
 yah kathan akashganga ke anya bhaagon ke vishay main satya nahin he
 It is now known with certainty that the density is different in different parts of each nebula
 taare ke bheetar ke padaarth kii pravriti gas ke ghaney meghon ke rup main vidyaman hone kii pai jaati he
 The mass of these clouds is similar to the beam of stars and sometimes the mass of massive constellations
 yah megh apane peeche sthit taron ke prakaash kaa avasorana hi nahin, varan uskaa prakirnan bhi karte hai, jisase taare kaa prakaash rakt varna kaa abhasith hone lagata he; udaahranarth, prithvi ke vayumandal ke anu sandhya samay surya ke prakaash kaa prakirnan kar surya ko rakt varna pradaan karte hai
 It is only by studying the quantity of this scattering that the determination of the mass of the bodies present in matter within the star is determined
 jaisaa pehle likhaa ja chukaa he, taron ke aantarik sanghatan ko jaanane kaa koi bhautik saadhan uplabdh nahin he
 Hence mathematical means have to be used to study this composition
 awalokit saamagree tathaa bhautik siddhanton ke anukool taron ke aantarik bhaag ke saral praturup kii kalpana kii jaati he or phir is praturup ke bhautik lakshna ganit kii reeti se nishchit kiye hote hai
 If these signs are similar to the star-illuminated signs, then it is concluded that there are similar physical states in the interior of the star as in the model
 aise kitne hi pratirupon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he
 As a result, proper knowledge of the composition of the interior of the stars has been obtained
