 magadan oblast rus ke siberia kshetra ke sudur purv main sthit rus kaa ek sangheey khand he jo us desh kii shashan pranali main oblast kaa darja rakhata he
 Its capital is the city of Magadan

 To the east it is neutral with the Sea of okhotsk

 Here gold, silver, tin and tungsten were found in the earth and in the decades of 1930–1940, food was made to remove them and the government of Soviet Union dictator Joseph Stalin built the slave laborers' camps and roads here

 Many Siberian tribal communities were originally inhabited here, such as the Aven, Koryak, Yupik, Chukchi, Oroch, Chuwai, and Itelmen, either from hunting fish in the Okhotsk Sea or reindeer-rearing in the Valley of the Colima River Used to live with audyogikaran se inaki mul jivan-pranali chhin-binn ho gai lekin sarkari sahaayta se yah apane nirvaah karte rahe
 After the collapse of the Soviet Union, this resort was closed, and now many people in these communities are unemployed and poor

 Any word can be spoken by breaking it into fractions and syllables are the parts of the word that cannot be made any shorter, otherwise the sounds of the word are changed
 udhaahrantah 'achaanak' shabd ke teen shabdaansh hai - 'a', 'chaa' or 'nak'
 If 'a-cha-nak' is spoken intermittently, the three syllables of the word can be seen fragmentarily but the pronunciation of the word seems to be correct
 agar 'nak' ko aage todaa jaae to shabd kii dhvaniyaan galat ho jaatin hai - 'a-chaa-na-k'
 is shabd ko 'a-chaan-k' bhi nahin bolaa jaataa kyonki is se bhi uccharan galat ho jaataa he
 Some short words have the same syllable, such as 'in', 'ear', 'hand', 'walk' and 'ja'
 Some words have two syllables, such as 'walker', food, handkerchief and vegetable
 kuch main teen yaa us se bhi adhik shabdaansh hote hai, jaise 'mahatvapurn' or 'antarrashtriya' 
 The word Akshar means - 'which cannot happen, nor can be destroyed'
 iskaa prayog pehle 'vaani' yaa 'vaak' ke liye evam shabdaansh ke liye hota tha
 The letter continued to be used for 'varna' as well
 yahi kaaran he ki lipi sanketon dwaara vyakt varnon ke liye bhi aaj 'akshar' shabd kaa prayog saamaanya jan karte hai
 Scientific study of the language has given the letter the meaning of English 'syllable', in which vowels, vowels and consonants, including vowels or consonant sounds with reminders, are considered
 ek hi aghat yaa bal main boli jane vaali dhwani yaa dhwani samudaay kii ikai ko akshar kaha jaataa he
 The basis of unit separation is the vowel or vowel consonant
 vyanjan dhwani kisi uccharan main swar kaa purv yaa par ang banakar hi aati he
 Astu, the vowel in the letter is the spine
 akshar se swar ko na to pruthak hi kiya ja saktaa he or na bina swar yaa swararat vyanjan ke akshar kaa nirmaan hi sambhav he
 If the consonant is like a pearl in pronunciation, the vowel is like a thread
 yadi swar shashakt samraat he to vyanjan ashakt raja
 It is on this basis that a letter is often considered synonymous with vowels, but it is not so, yet vowels have great importance in letter formation
 katipay bhashaaon main vyanjan dhvaniyaan bhi akshar nirmaan main sahaayak siddh hoti hai
 In English, consonant sounds like Na, Su and l are also pronounced vowrat and help in syllable formation like vowel sounds
 angreji silabal ke liye hindi main akshar shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Dr
 Ramvilas Sharma has used the word 'swarik' for syllable
 
 Since the word alphabet has been used for many meanings in the history of language and grammar, its use in the meaning of syllable leads to the possibility of confusion
 shabd ke uccharan main jis dhwani par shikharata yaa ucchata hoti he vahi akshar yaa silabal hota he, jaise haath main aa dhwani par
 This word has a letter
 'akalpit' shabd main teen akshar hai - a, kal, pit ; aazaadee main teen - aa ja di; arthath shabd main jahaan jahaan swar ke uccharan kii pruthakta pai jaae vahaan-vahaan akshar kii pruthakta hoti he
 When considered from the point of view of sound production, the unit of pleural circulation is called syllable or vocal, which has the same sound
 sharir rachana kii drushti se akshar yaa swarik ko phuffus spandan bhi kah sakate hai, jiskaa uccharan dhwani tantra main avarodhan hota he
 When the component is highest in the movement letter at the time of pronunciation of the sound block or the lowest sound group, then that sound is alphabetic
 swar dhvaniyaan bahudhaa aksharvat uccharit hoti he evam vyanjan dhvaniyaan kvachit
 The absolutely separate unit of lexical pronunciation is called a letter, as kisi shabd main aksharon kii sankhya is baat par katai nirbhar nahin karti ki usamen kitni dhvaniyaan hai, balki is baat par ki shabd kaa uccharan kitne aghat yaa jatke main hota he arthath shabd main kitni avyavhit dhwani ikaiyaan hai
 In addition to the head sound used in the letter, the remaining sounds are called ‘aksharang’ or ‘gahvar sound’
 udhaaharan ke liye 'chaar' main ek akshar he jisamen aa sheersh dhwani tathaa c evam r gahvar dhvaniyaan hai
 In any syllable there is a 'syllabus center', which is always the vowel character and other characters are found around it which can be consonants and also vowels
 The syllable center of the syllable 'ear' is the vowel of 'aa', from which the letters 'a' and 'n' come later

 So they named these particles ATOMS which is inspired by a Greek word ATOMOS which means inseparable
 By the end of the 19th century, however, scientists had come to know that ATOMS is not the original particle of the phenomenon, but rather the organization of even smaller particles

 These experiments also led to the development of nuclear weapons
 Between 1950 and 1960, many different particles were discovered in different experiments, also known as particle zoo, after the term particle zoo became a standard model in 1970
 In this standard model, almost all the particles were defined by some basic particles

 In the Korampurana, Vishnu in his Kachhapavatar described the four goals of life with the sages
 devraj indra ke shaury ko dekh rishi durvasa nen unhen parijaat pushp kii maala bhent kii parantu indra nen ise grahan na karte hue airavat ko pahana diya or airavat nen use bhoomi par phenk diya, durvasa ne isse krodhit hokar devataaon ko shraap de diya, inke devataaon par abhishaap ke kaaran, devataaon ne apni shakti kho di
 Frustrated with this, he reached Brahma for guidance
 unhone devataaon ko bhagwaan vishnu se sampark karne ko kaha
 Vishnu advised them to churn the Ksheer Samudra which would yield nectar
 is amrit ko pine se devon kii shakti waapas aa jaaegi ar ve sadaa ke liye amar ho jaayenge
 This huge work could only be done with the help of Mandar Parvat and Vasuki, where the mountain was used as a stick of Mathini and Vasuki as a rope
 is kaary ke liye asuron kaa bhi sahaara avashyak tha or iske kaaran sabhi devtaa aatankit ho gaye
 But Vishnu explained to them and the Asuras agreed to help the Devas at the behest of them, in the greed of nectar
 ve samudr kaa manthan karne lage, jahaan ek taraf asur the or dusri taraf dev the
 But due to this churn, a deadly poison started coming out which caused suffocation and threatened the whole world
 lekin bhagwaan mahadev bachaav ke liye aae or us zehar kaa seven kiya or apane kanth main use barkaraar rakhaa jisase unka nilkanth naam padaa
 The churning continued but the mountain began to sink slowly
 tabhi bhagwaan vishnu ne kurm avatar main avateern hue ek vishaal kachhue kaa avatar liya taaki apane peet kar pahaad ko uthaa saken
 The diameter of that turtle's back was 100,000 joints

 In this way, Kurma incarnation of God took place

 Chandragupta is the leading drama of the famous Hindi playwright Jaishankar Prasad
 isamen videshiyon se bharat kaa sangharsh or us sangharsh main bharat kii vijay kii theme uthaayi gayi he
 Prasad ji had a deep anguish about India's slavery
 is aitihaasik prasang ke madhyam se unhone apane isi vishwaas ko vaani di he
 In terms of craft, its speed is relatively relaxed
 isaki katha main vah sanghathan, santulan or ekthanta nahin he, jo ‘skandagupt’ main he
 The division of points and scenes is also inconsistent
 charitron kaa vikaas bhi thik tarah se nahin ho paaya he
 Nevertheless, 'chandragupta' is one of the best dramatics of Hindi, Prasadji's talent has covered its flaws
 ‘chandragupta’, jai shankar prasad ji dwaara likhit naatak he jo hindi-sahitya ke kshetra main bahut hi nami-giraami pustak he
 This play tells the story of the rise of 'chandragupta Maurya', the founder of the Maurya Empire, in a dramatic form
 yah naatak ‘chandragupta maury’ ke utthan ke saath-saath us samay ke mahashaktishaalee rajya ‘magadh’ ke raja ‘dhananand’ ke patan kii kahani bhi kahata he
 The play also tells the story of vengeance and faith of 'chanakya'
 yah naatak raajnneeti, kootneeti, shadyantra, ghaat-aghat-pratighaat, dwesh, ghrinaa, mahatvakanksha, balidaan or raashtra-prem kii kahani bhi kahata he
 The play also tells the story of greed, diplomacy and fear of the Greek cosmopolitan Alexander or Alexander or Alexander
 yah naatak prem or prem ke liye die gaye balidaan kii kahani bhi kahata he
 This play also tells the story of national unity proved by renunciation and renunciation
 ‘chandragupta’ or ‘chanakya’ ke upar kai videshi or deshi lekhakon ne bahut kuch likhaa he
 Different types of stories and different types of niches emanating from them are enough to create confusion in the mind
 lekin, yah naatak sabhi pustakon se kuch bhinn he
 Important advice for the readers who want to read this play is that it must read its role before the play
 jai shankar prasad ji ne is naatak kii bhoomika likhane ke liye jis prakaar kaa shodh kiya he vah kaabiletarif he jabaki mujhe lagata he kii tarif ke liye shabd hi nahin he
 He has presented various activities from the birth of Chandragupta to his coronation separately, picking up important points from the books of almost all the native and foreign writers
 is naatak kii bhoomika hi apane aap main shodh-patr se kam nahin he
 The postmortem of history which he has mentioned in his role by studying books written by all the indigenous and foreign historians, giving references to all and mentioning all kinds of phenomena related to 'chandragupta', will not be seen anywhere else
 
 naatak kaa prastutikaran evam usame prayog kii gayi saral hindi bhashaa is naatak ko pathneey banaati he
 At the same time, there are many songs in the middle of the drama that are always willing to settle in your heart
 prayek paatr kaa saundarya evam charitra chithran karne main ve safal rahe hai
 Also, by threading the events into a single thread, the play has become exciting to read
 meri ichha he kii kabhi bhavishya main main iskaa natya-manchan bhi dekh sakun taaki ise puri tarah se ji sakun
 There is much to learn in this drama and role
 bhoomika aapke dimag ke upar jami sabhi prakaar ke dhul ko hataane main madad karti he jo ‘chandragupta evam chanakya’ ke upar aadhaarit kai pustakon ko padhne se aa gaye the
 Bhoomika is a mixture made on this subject in a way that one becomes conscious after drinking or after reading it
 vahin naatak main manushya ke vibhinn roopon ko dekhakar ham bahut kuch sikh jate hai
 We can easily see many of Chanakya's policies in the play and get education
 jai shankar prasad kii yah rachana sahi myne main ek gyanavardhak evam manoranjak pustak he jise sabhi varg ke pathakon ko jarur padhnaa chahie
 Marathon is a long distance running event with an official distance of 42
195 km, which is usually run as a road race
 yah daud unani sainik fidipidis kii ek harkare ke taur par marathon ke yuddh se athens tak kii daud kii yaad main sthapit kii gai thi
 There is doubt in the truth of this legend, especially contradiction found in the account of Herodotus
 1896 ke olympic khel main marathon ek nayab daud thi, haalaanki duuri kaa maanakeekaran 1921 tak hi ho paaya
 500 marathons are held every year all over the world, most of them are amateur runners
 bade marathonon main dasiyon hazaron dhaavak bhi ho sakate hai
 The marathon name comes from the legend of a Greek runner named Phaedippidis

 Samosata's Lucian also tells the same story, but the runner's name is Philippidis
 is kinvadanti kii sachai vivaadaaspad he
 The Greek historian Herodotus, the principal source of the greek-persian wars, describes Phaedippidis as a hawker who carried a message of help to Sparta and back to Athens, a distance of more than 240 kilometers unilaterally
 kuch herrodotus pandulipiyon main athens se sparta ke bich daudane vaale dhaavak kaa naam philippidis diya gaya he
 Herodotus does not describe c Harkare sent from Marathon to Athens, and states that the main part of Athens' army immediately returned to Athens after the war was won by the Persian navy for fear of attacking Athens and They were back the same day
 1879 main, robert browning ne fidipidis naamak ek kavita likhi thi
 
 Browning's poetry and its narrative saga became part of nineteenth-century culture and accepted as a historical legend
 penteliko parvat marathon or athens ke bich main he, arthath yadi fedipidis yuddh ke baad vastav main dauda tha, to use pahaad ke kinare se nikalnaa hota - uttar athwa dakshin se
 The route to the south is more natural and the modern athens-marathon highway is also here, it runs along the coast south of Marathon Bay, climbs short but long and heads west and finishes east of Athens, It emerges from between the mountains of Heimatus and Panteli and then takes Athens with a slight slope
 yah rasta lagbhag 42 kilometre he or aadhunik yug main yahi is daud kii maanak lambaai he
 But some suggestions are that Fedepidis may have taken another route - climbing the Dionysos Pass westward between the eastern and northern climbs of the Penteli Mountains, taking the slope directly south to Athens

 When the idea of the modern Olympics became a reality in the late 19th century, the organizers were looking for ways to popularize it through the glory of ancient Greece to make it popular
 marathon daud yojit karne kaa vichaar mishael breyal se aayaa jo ki ise 1896 main athens ke pratham aadhunik olympic khel main shaamil karnaa chaahate the
 The idea received strong support from the Greeks and the founder of the modern Olympics, Pierre de Kubertin
 unaniyon ne pratiyogiyon ko chunane ke liye 10 march 1896 ko ek daud yojit kii jise chaarilaos vaasilacos ne 3 ghante 18 minute main puri kar ke jeeta 
 The winner of the first Olympic marathon was Spiridon "spiros" Luis, a Greek cousin
 unhone 10 april 1896 ko yah duuri 2 ghante 58 minute or 50 sekhind main puri kii
 The race was for men only
 mahilaon kaa marathon 1984 greeshm olympic main shuru hua or isamen vijeta thim sanyukt rajya kii jone benoit, unhone yah duuri 2 ghante 24 minute 52 sekhind main puri kii
 Since the inception of the modern Games, it has been the tradition that the men's Olympic Marathon is the final game and ends just before or during the closing ceremony at the Olympic Stadium
 2004 ke greeshm olympic main marathon se athens tak daud hui or iskaa ant 1896 greeshm olympic ke sthal panathinaco stadium main hua

 Olympic Marathon Length shuru main marathon kii lambai natthi nahin kii gai kyonki sabhi dhaavak usee raste par dauden yahi zyaada zaruri tha
 Some of the earlier Olympic Games had marathon races of no fixed distance, but about 40 kilometers, which is the length of the long flat route from Marathon to Athens
 har daud kii apni apni lambaai hoti thi
 In May 1921, the International Professional Athletic Association set the standard marathon length as 42
195 km

 The same arbitrary distance applied for the marathon of London's 1908 Summer Olympics

 In November 1907, a road map of the same length appeared in newspapers, starting at the Windsor Fort and ending at the White City Stadium in Sheppards Bush, London

 So it was decided that the distance to the stadium would be 26 miles and then a rounding of the track entering from the royal entrance would end the race on the royal balcony

 The start of the actual Olympic marathon began with King Edward viii's private eastern platform at the Windsor Fort in Ley so that the general public would not be interrupted at the start of the race
 wales kii rajkumaari tech kii mairi or unke bachche, windsar great park ke duusare chor par fragamor main apane ghar se savaar ho ke daud kii sharuaat dekhne aae
 Shortly before the start of the game it was realized that the royal entrance could not be made a marathon entrance - it was elevated so that royal riders could easily get off their trains and it did not open on the way to the run, so The second entrance was chosen which was on the other corner of the royal box
 franko british pradarshnee maidan ke thik baahar ek vishesh rasta banaaya gaya taaki stadium tak kii duuri 26 mile rahe

 aitihaasik polytechnic marathon 1996 main band kar diya gaya tha
 The Ultimate Guide to International Marathons, written by Denis Crathern and Rich Hanna, calls the Stockholm Marathon the world's best marathon
 World records were not officially recognized by the ieeef until January 1, 2004; previously, the best times for the marathon were referred to as the 'world best'
 Courses must conform to ieeef standards for a record to be recognized
 However, marathon routes still vary greatly in elevation, course, and surface, making exact comparisons impossible
 Typically, the fastest times are set over relatively flat courses near sea level, during good weather conditions and with the assistance of pacesetters
 The world record time for men over the distance is 2 hours 3 minutes and 59 seconds, set in the Berlin Marathon by Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia on September 28, 2008, an improvement of 51 minutes and 19 seconds since Johnny Hayes' gold medal performance at the 1908 Summer Olympics
 Gebrselassie's world record represents an average pace of under 2:57 per kilometre, average speed of over 20
4 km / h
 The world record for women was set by Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain in the London Marathon on April 13, 2003, in 2 hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds
 This time was set using male pacesetters; the fastest time by a woman without using a male pacesetter was also set by Paula Radcliffe, again during the London Marathon, with a time of 2 hours 17 minutes and 42 seconds, on April 17, 2005
 ieeeff ke aankadon ke anusaar, ye purush va mahilaayein marathon duuri main das sabase adhik tej hai
 Most participants do not run a marathon to win
 More important for most runners is their personal finish time and their placement within their specific gender and age group, though some runners just want to finish
 Strategies for completing a marathon include running the whole distance and a run-walk strategy
 In 2005, the average marathon time in the US was 4 hours 32 minutes 8 seconds for men, 5 hours 6 minutes 8 seconds for women
 Another goal people can aim for is to break certain time barriers
 For example, recreational first-timers often try to run the marathon under four hours; more competitive runners may attempt to finish under three hours
 Other benchmarks are the qualifying times for major marathons
 The Boston Marathon, the oldest marathon in the United States, requires a qualifying time for all non-professional runners
 The New York City marathon also requires a qualifying time for guaranteed entry, at a pace slightly faster than Boston's
 a qualifying time is also needed for Washington d
c
's National Marathon
 However, unlike Boston, where the qualifying times serve to attract a more talented field and limit participation, the National Marathon is motivated more by the need to reopen city streets in a limited amount of time
 Long running is an important thing in marathon training
 shaukia dhaavak aamtaur par adhiktam 20 mile daudane kii koshish karte hai or puure hafte main kuch 40 mile daudane kii koshish karte hai, lekin vastav main abhyaas karne vaale aksar aisa nahin karte hai

 Most male elite marathon runners will have weekly mileages of over 100 miles
 Many training programs last a minimum of five or six months, with a gradual increase in the distance run and finally a little decrease for recovery
 The decrease, commonly called the taper, should last a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of three weeks, according to most trainers
 For beginners wishing to merely finish a marathon, a minimum of 4 months of running 4 days a week is recommended
 Many trainers recommend a weekly increase in mileage of no more than 10%
 It is also often advised to maintain a consistent running program for six weeks or so before beginning a marathon training program to allow the body to adapt to the new stresses
 The marathon training program itself would suppose variation between the hard and the easy training, with a periodization of the general plan
 Training programs may be found at Runner's World, Hal Higdon, Jeff Galloway, Boston Athletic Association and from numerous other sources
 Overtraining is a condition that results from not getting enough rest to allow the body to recover from stressful training
 It can result in lowered endurance and speed and place a runner at a greater risk of injury
 During the last two or three weeks before the marathon, runners will typically reduce their weekly training, gradually, by as much as 50% -75% of previous peak volume, and take at least a couple of days of complete rest to allow their bodies to recover from any strong effort
 The last long training run might be expected no later than two weeks prior to the event
 This is a phase of training known as tapering
 Many marathon runners also "carbo-load" during the week before the marathon to allow their bodies to store more glycogen
 Immediately before the race, many runners will refrain from eating solid food to avoid digestive problems
 They will also ensure that they are fully hydrated beforehand
 Light stretching before the race is believed by many to help keep muscles limber
 Some runners will wear an ice vest before the race to reduce their core temperature so as to avoid overheating later in the race
 Coaches recommend trying to maintain as steady a pace as possible when running a marathon
 Some advise novice runners to start out slower than their average goal pace to save energy for the second half of the race
 As an example, the first five to eight miles might be run at a pace 15–20 seconds per mile slower than the target pace for later
 Typically, there is a maximum allowed time of about six hours after which the marathon route is closed, although some larger marathons keep the course open considerably longer 
 Modern marathons such as New York, Chicago, London and Berlin have tens of thousands of runners and millions of spectators
 Common courtesy for other runners becomes necessary when running in a densely packed crowd
 Those employing a walk / run strategy or who are simply walking are encouraged to stay to one side, leaving the middle of the street for faster runners
 Runners in groups are encouraged not to block the entire street, preventing other runners from passing them
 Two or three runners abreast is recommended
 Large groups may consider single or double files
 Many marathons around the world have a time limit by which all runners must have crossed the finish line
 Anyone slower than that will be picked up by the sweeper bus
 In many cases the marathon event organization is required to re-open the roads to the public so that traffic can return to normal
 Refusing to get on the bus could cause traffic hazards and would embarrass the organization
 While drinking fluids during the race is important for all runners, in some cases too much drinking can also be dangerous
 Drinking more than one loses during a race can decrease the concentration of sodium in the blood, which may result in vomiting, seizures, coma and even death
 Eating salt packets during a race mitigates this problem
 The International Marathon Medical Directors Association issued a warning in 2001 that urged runners only to drink when they are thirsty, rather than "drinking ahead of their thirst
" Women are more prone to hyponatremia than men
 a study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 13% of runners completed the 2002 Boston Marathon had hyponatremia
 a 4+ hour runner can drink about 4-6 fluid ounces every 20–30 minutes without fear of hyponatremia
 Consuming sports drinks or salty snacks will also reduce the risk
 a patient suffering hyponatremia can be given a small volume of a concentrated salt solution intravenously to raise sodium concentrations in blood
 Some runners weigh themselves before running and write the results on their bibs
 If anything goes wrong, first aid workers can use the weight information to tell if the patient had consumed too much water
 Carbohydrates that a person eats are converted by the liver and muscles into glycogen for storage
 Glycogen burns rapidly to provide quick energy
 Runners can store about 8 MJ or 2,000 kcal worth of glycogen in their bodies, enough for about 30 km / 18–20 miles of running
 Many runners report that running becomes noticeably more difficult at that point
 When glycogen runs low, the body must then burn stored fat for energy, which does not burn as readily
 When this happens, the runner will experience dramatic fatigue and is said to "hit the wall"
 The aim of training for the marathon, according to many coaches, is to maximize the limited glycogen available so that the fatigue of the "wall" is not as dramatic
 Carbohydrate-based "energy" gels are used by runners to avoid or reduce the effect of "hitting the wall", as they provide easy to digest energy during the run
 Energy gels usually contain varying amounts of sodium and potassium and some also contain caffeine
 They need to be consumed with a certain amount of water
 Recommendations for how often to take an energy gel during the race range widely
 Alternatives to gels are solid candy, cookies, other forms of concentrated sugars, or any food high in simple carbohydrates which can be digested easily by the individual runner
 Many runners experiment with consuming energy supplements during training runs to determine what works best for them
 Consumption of food while running sometimes makes the runner sick
 Runners are advised not to ingest a new food or medicine just prior to or during a race
 It's also important to refrain from taking any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory class of pain relievers, as these drugs change the way the kidneys regulate their blood flow and may lead to severe kidney problems, especially in cases involving moderate to severe dehydration
 Marathon participation may result in various medical, musculoskeletal, and dermatological complaints
 Delayed onset muscle soreness is a common condition affecting runners during the first week following a marathon
 Various types of mild exercise or massage have been recommended to alleviate pain secondary to DOMS
 Dermatological issues frequently include "jogger's nipple", "jogger's toe", and blisters
 The immune system is impressive suppressed for a short time
 Changes to the blood chemistry may lead physicians to mistakenly diagnose heart malfunction
 After long training runs and the marathon itself, consuming carbohydrates to replace glycogen stores and protein to aid muscle recovery is commonly recommended
 In addition, soaking the lower half of the body for 20 minutes or so in cold or ice water may force blood through the leg muscles to speed recovery
 a study published in 1996 found that the risk of having a fatal heart attack during, or in the period 24 hours after a marathon, was approximately 1 in 50,000 over an athlete's racing career — which the authors characterized as an "extremely small" risk
 The paper went on to say that since the risk was so small, cardiac screening programs for marathons were not warranted
 However, this study was not an attempt to assess the overall benefit or risk to cardiac health of marathon running
 In 2006, a study of 60 non-elite marathon participants tested runners for certain proteins which indicate heart damage or dysfunction after they had completed the marathon, and gave them ultrasound scans before and after the race
 The study revealed that, in that sample of 60 people, runners who had done less than 35 miles per week training before the race were most likely to show some heart damage or dysfunction, while runners who had done more than 45 miles per week training beforehand showed few or no heart problems
 In 2007, Ryan Shay, a 28 year-old elite long-distance runner, died after collapsing early in the US Olympic marathon trials
 His death was reported as probably due to a pre-existing heart abnormality
 As marathon running has become more popular, some athletes have undertaken to complete goals involving the running of a series of marathons
 In the United States, a popular goal is to run a marathon in each state plus Washington, DC
 Over 350 individuals have completed this circuit once and some have done it eight times
 In 2004, Chuck Bryant of Miami, Florida, who lost his right leg below the knee, became the first amputee to finish this circuit
 Bryant has completed a total of 59 marathons on his prosthesis
 Twenty-seven people have run a marathon on each of the seven continents, and 31 people have run a marathon in each of the Canadian provinces
 In 1980, in what was termed the Marathon of Hope, Terry Fox, who had lost a leg to cancer and so ran with an artificial leg, attained 5,373 km of his proposed cross-canada cancer fundraising run, thus improving an average of over 37 Kilometers, close to the planned marathon distance, for each of 143 consecutive days
 On February 8, 2009, John Wallace claimed to become the first person to run marathons in 100 different countries
 However, some of his runs were not official races but individual runs over the marathon distance; furthermore some of his 'countries' are not independent
 Previously, Wally Herman had run marathons in 99 different countries
 In 2003 British adventurer Sir Ranulph Fiennes completed seven marathons on seven continents in seven days
 He completed this feat despite suffering from a heart attack and undergoing a double heart bypass operation just four months before
 On December 14, 2008, 64-year old Larry Macon set a record by running 105 marathons in a single calendar year
 On September 15, 2009, comedian Eddie Izzard, at the age of 47, completed his 43rd marathon in 51 days which had taken him around the United Kingdom
 This feat was completed to boost donations to the UK charity Sport Relief
 Before starting his running, Eddie trained for just seven weeks 
 In Europe a goal among some people is to run the greatest number of marathon races overall in one's lifetime
 There is something called the 100-club, for example
 To qualify one must have run 100 races
 Other goals are to attempt to run marathons on a series of consecutive weekends, or to run the most marathons during a particular year or the most in a lifetime
 a pioneer in running multiple marathons was Sy Mah of Toledo, Ohio, who ran 524 before he died in 1988
 John Bozung, a runner based in the Utah area, claims to have the current "unofficial" record for having run 258 marathons in 170 consecutive months as of November 2007
 As of June 30, 2007, Horst Preisler of Germany had successfully completed 1214 marathons plus 347 ultramarathons, a total of 1561 events at marathon distance or longer
 Sigrid Eichner, Christian Hottas and hans-joachim Meyer have also all completed over 1000 marathons each
 Norm Frank of the United States is credited with 945 marathons
 In 2010, Stefaan Engels, a Belgian, set out to run a marathon every day of the year
 Although he finished some with a handbike, due to an injury, he broke the current record of Akinori Kusuda, from Japan, who ran 52 marathons in 52 days
 Engels ran and biked 233 marathons in the first 233 days
 Some runners compete to run the same marathons for the most consecutive years
 For example, Johnny Kelley completed 61 Boston Marathons
 Four runners, dubbed the "ground pounders", have completed all 32 US Marine Corps Marathons
 Another mention for most consecutive marathons is Jerald Fenske, who has completed every Paavo Nurmi Marathon he has entered since his first in 1978 at age 17, a total of 33 consecutive finishes through 2010
 Template: Athletics events mithila pracheen bharat main ek rajya tha
 It is believed that it is the present-day Terai region of North Bihar and Nepal which was known as Mithila
 mithila kii lokshruti kai sadiyon se chali aa rahi he jo apni bauddhik parampara ke liye bharat or bharat ke baahar jaani jaati rahi he
 Maithili is the main language of this region
 hindu dharmik granthon main sabase pehle iskaa sanket shatapath brahman main tathaa spasht ullekh valmikiy ramayana main miltaa he
 Mithila is mentioned in Mahabharata, Ramayana, Purana and Jain and Buddhist texts
 puranic ullekhon ke anusaar is kshetra kaa sarvaadhik pracheen naam mithila hi praapt hota he; saath hi videh naam se bhi ise sambodhit kiya gaya he
 The name arrowhead proves to be much later according to the mentions received
 videh or mithila namakaran kaa sarvaadhik pracheen sambandh shatapath brahman main ullikhit videgh maathav se judata he
 The early times of Mithila settling are indicated in the above story
 videgh maathav tathaa uske purohit gotam rahuugan saraswati nadi ke tir se purv kii ore chale the
 In front of them, fire was running after the water of the global rivers
 sadanira nadi ko agni sukha nahin sake or videgh maathav dwaara yah puche jane par ki ab meraa nivas kahan ho, agni ne uttar diya ki is nadi ke purv kii ore tumhaara nivas ho
 It is clearly mentioned in the Shatapatha Brahmin that earlier Brahmins did not cross this river and the land here was not fertile
 usamen daldal bahut tha kyonki agni vaishwanar ne uskaa aswadan nahin kiya tha
 But now it is very fertile because the Brahmins have sacrificed it and offered it to the fire
 gandki nadi ke bare main yah bhi ullekh he ki garmi ke baad ke dinon main bhi, arthath kaaphi garmi ke dinon main bhi, yah nadi khub bahati he
 Videha seems to be related to the word Videgh and Mithila with the word Mathav
 shatapath main hi gandaki nadi ke bare main ullekh karte hue spasht rup se videh shabd kaa bhi ullekh hua he
 There it has been said that till now this river is the boundary between Kosala and Vidah countries; And this land has been called the child of Mathav
 valmikiy ramayana tathaa vibhinn puraanon main mithila naam kaa sambandh raja nimi ke putr mithi se joda gaya he
 There is a legend everywhere in these texts with minimal differences that Mithi was born from the churning of Nimi's dead body
 valmikiy ramayana main mithi ke vanshaj ke maithil kahalaane kaa ullekh hua he jabaki puranic granthon main mithi ke dwaara hi mithila ke basaaye jane kii baat spasht rup se kahi gayi he
 In many texts, it is said in many texts that his name was born because of his birth, he was called Vaideh because of his birth from Videha father and his name became Mithi due to his birth from churning
 is prakaar unheen ke naam se unke dwaara shasit pradesh kaa naam videh tathaa mithila mana gaya he
 In the Mahabharata, the name of the state has been called 'mithila' and its rulers have been called 'videha dynasty'
 vrihadvishnupurana ke mithila-mahatmaya main mithila evam tirbhukti donon naam kahe gayi hai
 Due to being situated on the arrow of Mithila and many rivers in the name of Mithi, the name of arrow has been considered because of the enjoyment of arrows
 is granth main ganga se lekar himalay ke bich sthit mithila main mukhya 15 nadiyon kii sthiti maani gayi he tathaa unke naam bhi ginaye gayi hai
 Explaining the significance of Mithila, the mithila-mahatmya section of the Old Age Purana states that there is the ultimate sacred arrowhead consisting of 15 rivers between the Ganges and the Himalayas
 yah tirbhukti mithila sita kaa nimicanan he, gyaan kaa kshetra he or krupa kaa peeth he
 Know that this birthplace Mithila is sinless and innocent
 yah ram ko anand dene vaali tathaa mangaladaayini he
 Prayag etc
 is going to give merit in pilgrimage places but is not able to get Rama; But this Mithila is definitely special in all kinds of appeasing Rama
 jaise saket nagari sansar ke kaaran swaroop he vaise hi yah mithila samast anand kaa kaaran swaroop he
 Therefore Maharsighans reside here for the worship of Rama leaving all the parigras
 shrisavitri tathaa shrigauri jaisi dev-shaktiyon ne yahi janm grahan kiya
 This Mithila is the birthplace of Sarveshwareshwari Sreesita ji herself, who will give all the accomplishments by diligently dwelling
 mahabharat main magadh ke baad mithila kii sthiti maani gayi he
 Describing the Magadha Yatra of Sri Krishna, Arjuna and Bhima, it is mentioned that after crossing the Saryu river, crossing eastern Kosala region and then crossing Mahashon, Gandaki and Sadaniira to Mithila
 punah ganga tathaa mahashon ko paar karke magadh main jane kii baat kahi gayi he
 It seems clear from this that at that time Mithila's position in the north of Magadha has been considered
 vajji pradesh mithila ke antargat hi samavisht tha
 Even in this mention of the Mahabharata, the border area of mithila is indicated elsewhere as far as Gandaki in the west and Ganga in the south
 vrihadvishnupurana main mithila kii seemaa kaa spasht ullekh karte hue kaha gaya he ki- That is, there are 24 yojana starting from Kosi in the east to Gandaki in the west and 16 Yojana extending from the Ganges River in the south to the Himalayan forest in the north
 mahakavi chandaa jha ne uparyukt shloke kaa hi maithili roopantaran karte hue mithila kii seemaa bataate hue likhaa he ki Thus, under the mentioned border, the districts of Bihar, presently in western Champaran, East Champaran, Shivhar, Sitamarhi, Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Samastipur, Begusarai, Darbhanga, Madhubani, Supaul, Madhepura, Saharsa and Khagaria district The entire area and partial area of bhagalpur district comes
 yah seemaa pracheen ullekhon ke anusaar he sambhawatah kosi kii atyadhik prasiddhi tathaa aniyantrit failaav ke kaaran bhi purvi seemaa kosi ko mana gaya he
 There has been no fixed route to Kosi before the dam was built
 purvi bihar ke sabhi kshetron se praayah kosi bahi he
 Therefore, the whole of eastern Bihar has been a natural part of Mithilanchal before the commencement of West ie West Bengal from Mahananda River
 vrihadvishnupurana main ganga tathaa himalay ke bich sthit mithila ke antargat mukhya 15 nadiyon kii sthiti bataayi gayi he
 Their names are as follows: - ye sab apekshaakrit tatkaaleen badi nadiyon ke naam hai; parantu inke atirikt bhi mithilanchal main anek choti-choti nadiyaan pracheen samay se aaj tak anwarat pravaahit hai or mithila ke 'tirbhukti' naam ko sarthak kar rahi hai
 Apart from being a special place related to shriram-sita, Mithila Devadhidev has been particularly famous as a place of worship of Mahadev
 vrihad vishnupurana ke anusaar yahan ke antarvarti pramukh shivlingon ke naam is prakaar hai:- The names of Sinhasevara Mahadev and Kameshwar Linga have been taken with utmost reverence, mentioning the bordering Shivalingas in the sequence of Mithila Parikrama
 is prakaar yahan ekadash shivlingon ke naam pariganit kiye gayi hai
 In the past, it has been said that after paying obeisance to Sinhasevara Mahadev, starting the circumambulation and going back to Simhaeshwar Mahadev and completing the rules and going home
 • janakapur Ghoghia is a village in Almora district of Kumaon division under the Uttarakhand state of India in Dwarahat tehsil
 jyamiti yaa rekhganit ganit kii teen vishaal shakhaon main se ek he
 In this, the properties, measurements and relative position of the points, lines, planks and solids are studied in their space
 jyamiti, gyaan kii sabase pracheen shakhaon main se ek he
 Geometry is that branch of mathematics in which the study of points, lines, curves, planes, etc
, is studied
 bhoomi ke naap sambandhi kaaryon se is vigyaan kii utpatti hui, isaliye is ganit ko bhumiti bhi kehete hai
 Initially this study was limited to the properties of lines and areas surrounded by lines, due to which geometry is also named Geometry
 bharat main yagyavediyon ke nirmaan kaary main ganitagyon kaa dhyaan jyamiti ke adhyayan kii or aakrisht kiya, unke adhyayan main kshetrasmiti kaa put adhik tha
 Historians believe that Indians knew such relationships as 32 + 42 = 52, 1,000 years before Christ, but they did not study such relationships in any other way except for some similar small equations
 isa se lagbhag 600 varsh purv rome ke ganitagya pithagoras ne is sambandh kaa bade tarkpurna dhang se adhyayan kiya or yah bataaya ki ek samakon tribhuj main karn par kaa varg anya bhujaaon ke upar virgon ke yogafal ke baraabar hota he
 Although the study of geometry started almost simultaneously in all the old civilized countries, such as Egypt, Babylonia, China, India and Greece, but no other country has progressed as much in this science as Greece
 isa se lagbhag 300 varsh purv yunaan ke ek ganitaj euclid ne us samay tak jitne tathy gyaat the un sabko bade tarkpurna dhang se krambaddh kiya
 He tried to prove other facts on the basis of known facts
 is prakaar tathyon ko krambaddh karne par vah kuch aise praarambhik tathyon par pahunchaa jinako siddh karnaa kathin he
 Well they seem very clear
 ye tathy itane saral hai ki euclid ne inhen swayansiddh maan liya or inhen swayan tathy kaha he
 The proof of theorems of geometry is dependent on these facts
 ve tathy nimnlikhit hai : 1
 Those things, which are equal to the same thing, are also equal among themselves
 2
 yadi baraabar vastuon main baraabar vastuen jod di jaayan to yogafal baraabar hote hai
 3
 If equal items are subtracted from equal items then the remainder are equal
 4
 baraabar vastuon ke samaan gune baraabar hote hai
 5
 If two lines intersect the third line and the sum of the inner angles of one side is less than two right angles, then where the joint is less, the two lines will meet at a point when extended
 6
 isi prakaar rachanakaarya main bhi ek rachana se duusari rachana kar sakate hai, parantu ant main kuch aisi rachanaaon par pahonchte hai jinka prayog duusare prayogon par nirbhar nahin karata
 These compositions can also be taken forward by considering themselves
 ve Apart from these, they do not accept any other facts without proving them
 uparyukt paanch swayan tathyon main se chaar to itane saral tathaa sapsht hai ki inhen siddh karnaa apane haath ko apana siddh karne ke baraabar he, parantu paanchavaan swayantathy swayansiddh sa prathit nahin hota
 Mathematicians objected to this fact as axiomatic and tried hard to prove it
 inhen yatnon ke falswaroop bade bade avishkaar hue
 Similarly, new geographical terms are mentioned in geometry
 ek shabd kii paribhaasha duusare shabdon kii paribhaasha par nirbhar karti he
 Finally, let us see that these definitions are based on the definitions of point, line and plane
 euclid ke anusaar samtal vah he jisamen lambaai chaudaai ho, parantu motaai na ho
 Many people are skeptical of this definition as well, but a little reflection will make it clear that the definition is correct
 udaahranarth, yadi kaanch ke ek baratan main do aise taral padaarth bhar die jaayan jo aapas main na milte ho to jab ve sthir ho jaayan tab ham dekhgen ki ek tal donon padaarthon ko alag karata he
 It does not have thickness
 yadi hoti to donon taralon ke bich aisa sthaan hota jisamen na neeche kaa padaarth hota na upar kaa, parantu aisa asambhav he
 This example would have made it clear that the floor does not have thickness
 isamen keval lambaai or chaudaai hi hoti he
 Similarly, looking at the shade of a flat wall in the sun, we can say that the line does not have width
 rekha tal main sthit he, at: tal kii motaai rekha kii motaai hui
 Therefore the line has neither thickness nor width, only length
 rekhaayen ek bindu par milti hai to rekha kii chaudaai bindu kii lambaai hui, arthath bindu main na lambaai hoti he, na chaudaai, motaai
 There is only space
 sabhi is baat se parichit honge ki jyamiti main tribhuj, varg, vrutt, shanku, belan ityadi ke gunon kaa adhyayan hota he1 puraane samay main kuch prashnon ne ganitagyon ko kaaphi uljhaae rakhaa
 The solutions to those questions gave a lot of thought, there is no doubt in this, like making a cube whose cube is twice the given cube
 us samay rachana kaa arth patari or parkaar kii sahaayta se hi rachana karnaa samajha jaataa tha
 The second question was to make a square whose area is equal to the area of the given circle
 teesraa prashn tha ki ek die hue kone ko teen baraabar bhaagon main baantna
 This work is impossible with track and compass, but can be done by other means
 in prashnon ne shatabdiyon tak ganitagyon ko vyast rakhaa
 Mathematics was greatly benefited by his deliberations, no doubt
 ek shanku ko kisi samtal se kaatane se jo dirghavritt, paravalay, tathaa atiparavalay vakr banate hai unke gunon kaa bhi unaniyon ne adhyayan kiya
 These studies may have helped Kaplan in finding his rules
 15veen shatabdi tak jyamiti main praaia: naap sambandhi gunon kaa hi adhyayan hota tha, parantu uske baad aise gunon kaa bhi adhyayan hua jo naap par nirbhar nahin karte; jaise yadi do tribhujon ke sheershabindu ek teen bindugami rekha par hon to sangat bhujaayen ek rekha par milengi
 This goal attracted the attention of mathematicians to another type of geometry called projectional geometry
 yadi ham kisi drishy ke chitra par dhyaan den to anubhav karte hai ki use dekhakar drishy kaa puraa gyaan ho jaataa he
 But in the picture, the circle is not a circle, neither all the parallel lines are parallel, neither the right angle is the right angle, but sometimes the right angle is seen to be a right angle, sometimes more angle; Nevertheless, there are some such qualities in the scene that even after changing the shapes, they get complete knowledge from the picture
 ye gun nishchar kehalaate hai
 Similar properties are studied in projectional geometry
 maan len, ek bindu ba or ek chaturbhuj k kha ga gha diya hua he
 If the lines joining each point of the quadrilateral are drawn from point b and extend them and then cut these lines from a plane, a drawing will be made on this plane
 vah is chaturbhuj kaa prakshep tathaa yah prayog bindu ba ke saapeksh roopantaran kehalaayegaa
 Similarly, by taking a second point, you can also interpolate this interpolation relative to it
 jo gun nahin badalte unhen prakshep dwaara kisi saral bahubhuj main badalakar adhyayan karte hai
 These properties will also be good for the original polygon
 saath hi kai roopantaran milakar ek roopantaran prayog ke samaan hote hai
 The study of these experiments is also a part of this geometry
 yadi kisi gole yaa vrutt kaa centre k ho tathaa trigya tra ho or yadi kisi bindu ba kii centre k se duuri r ho or yadi r' duuri par rekha k ba main ba' doosraa bindu ho, jahaan r1 tra2 to ba ke kisi bindupath ke sangat ba' kaa bhi path hoga
 The path of b is called the inverse of the path of B
 prayek kshetra pratilomon kaa adhyayan hi is shakha kaa dhyey he
 The 5th axiomatic fact of Euclid has been given above
 ise swayansiddh maanane ke liye ganitagya kabhi taiyaar nahin hue, balki unhone ise siddh karne ke bade bade ytn kiye; parantu kaai santoshjanak uttar nahin mila
 Mathematics developed a lot as a result of research and a geometry was invented which created a complete revolution in geometry
 euclid ne samtal par hi sab vivechan kiye, parantu ab har prakaar ke talon par alag alag vivechnaayen hoti hai
 Its interpretation is difficult, so for this, the readers should look at the special books on this subject
 17veen shatabdi ke madhya main francisi ganitagya decort ne jyamiti main bijganit kaa prayog kar ise bahut shaktishaalee bana diya
 He first took two cutting lines, called axes
 kisi bindu kii in rekhaon ke samaantar naapi hui duuri do sankhyaon ya r se uskaa sthaan nishchay kiya
 These lines are called the coordinates of the point
 in nirdeshaankon kii sahaayta se prayek jyamitiya tathy ko bijaganitiya sameekaran dwaara pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 This geometry developed in many directions
 pehali dasha main to jyamiti kaa vyapak rup saamne aayaa, jaise ek ghaat kaa sameekaran ek saral rekha pradarshit karata he
 Similarly, the equation of two powers represents a conic
 isi prakaar teen, chaar or ucchtar ghaaton ke samikarnon kaa adhyayan hone laga or unke sangat vakron ke gunon kaa vivechan pehle se bahut saral ho gaya
 It became possible to study not only the curves of the floor but also the curves of the recess
 iske liye ek bindugami teen samatalon se kisi bindu kii duriyon ya r l na uskaa sthaan nishchit karte hai or prayek bindupath ko ya, r, l main ek sameekaran dwaara pradarshit karte hai
 By considering these equations, the properties of the planes and curves are easily studied
 duusari disha main rachana sambandhi prashnon kaa hal tathaa kriyaayein bahut saral ho gayi
 These verbs depend only on the solution of some equations, in which very broad questions are easily solved; For example, if the line intersects a curve = o, the solution of both these equations will determine the location of their intersection points
 yadi in samikarnon ke mul vaastavik hai, to rekha vakr ko katati he
 If equal, the line touches the curve
 yadi kaalpanik hai to rekha vakr ko nahin katati, parantu ham yah kah sakate hai ki rekha vakr ko sadaiv do binduon par kaategi, chaahe bindu vaastavik yaa sampati hon, athwa kaalpanik hon
 Similarly, facts can be given in a very broad form, which was not possible in ordinary geometry
 teesri disha main nirdeshaank jyamiti ne vimiti ko vyapak kiya
 Two numbers are Y, r in two dimensions and three numbers determine the position of a point in three dimensions
 ab ganitagyon ke saamne yah prashn uthaa ki chaar sankhyaayein ya, r, l, va yaa paanch sankhyaayein ya, r, l, va, ha kya pradarshit karengi
 Mathematicians thought very easily in their minds that abstract four numbers would determine the position of a point in four dimensions and five numbers in five dimensions
 is prakaar unhone sa vimitiyon kaa vichaar bhi acchhee tarah soch liya
 He does not mean whether there is any example of him in the earthly world
 instine ne avashya is vichaar kaa apane saapeksh siddhant main upyog kiya or vimiti ke vichaar kaa spashtikaran kiya
 Now use this idea of high dimensionality to solve some difficult problems in untapped mathematics
 jaise kisi chal taral padaarth ke bhinn bhinn kanon kaa sthaan, saat sankhyaon se pradarshit karte hai
 They are A, B, C, its initial position, and three velocities, which are parallel to Y, R, l axis, and time, this can be solved by considering the question of seven dimensions
 chauthi disha main nirdeshaank jyamiti ne sankhyaon kaa vyapkikaran kiya or kaalpanik sankhyaon kaa aavirbhaav hua
 Concepts such as hypothetical points and imaginary curves, etc
, made geometry very important, which further helped in generalization, such as the conic circle going from two imaginary points at infinity, etc
 iske atirikt jyamiti kaa vivechan bhinn bhinn prakaar ke nirdeshaankon kii sahaayta se hone laga, jaise samghaateey nirdeshaank, trikoniya nirdeshaank, sparsheey nirdeshaank ityadi
 Almost 50 years after the use of coordinates, calculus was also used in geometry
 is prayog ne jyamiti main nai nai vichaardhaaraen utpann kin
 These are called differential geometry

 In January – February 1948 Osman Khadera was attacked in the fierce attacks of both Novashera and Jhangar, both in highly strategic locations in Jammu and Kashmir
 During the defense of Nowshera against overwhelming odds, about the number of Pakistanis on the number and casualties given to the Indian Army around 2000, while the Indian Army suffered only 33 dead and 102 wounded
 Her defense earned her the nickname Lion of Novashera
 The Pakistani forces then announced an amount of Rs 50,000 for his head
 Unaffected by applause and congratulations, Osman continued to sleep laid on the floor on a mat as he vowed that he would not sleep on a bed until he recaptured back to Jhangar, where he was Late 1947
