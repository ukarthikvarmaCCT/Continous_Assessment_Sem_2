 The Corporate Bodies Authority File or GKD is a German authority control for the organization of corporation names from catalogs
 It is mainly used for documentation in libraries
 Like the Subject Headings Authority File and the Name Authority File, the GKD is looked after and updated by the German National Library, the Bavarian State Library, the Berlin State Library and, since 1997, the Austrian National Library, several library networks taking part
 The responsible editor is the State Library in Berlin
 The Common Corporate File was created in the 1970s from the catalog data of the Journal Database
 In April 2004 it contained more than 915,000 records
 Since April 2012 GKD, SWD and PND are part of the Integrated Authority File 
 As with the SWD and PND, the "rules for Alphabetical Cataloging" are used
 They stipulate, amongst other things, what counts as a corporation
 These include, inter alia, local authorities and associations such as firms and clubs, but also congresses and exhibitions
 In addition to names of individual corporations, GKD data files contain links to parent bodies as well as earlier and later names
 GKD records are uniquely identified by an ID number, the GKD number
 The GKD number consists of digits, the last being a check digit, which can also be 'X'
 The number ranges are divided into quotas by library network, so that, for newer records, it can be determined in which network they were created
 The GKD, like the PND and SWD, is available to information systems in libraries and other areas via the DDB file on a standard CD-ROM or through a Z39
50 interface - but usually only for a fee
 For access to authority records, there is a separate Machine Exchange Format for Libraries or MAB GKD
 Previously microfiches were used 
 The search for individual corporations enabled by the GKD is part of many catalogs
 a link to the name authorities of the Library of Congress is provided
 a link to Wikipedia is still in the planning stage
 The example is not given directly in internal PICA + or MAB format
 GKD records can refer to one another using "earlier / later name" and "belonging to" fields

 The end of the revolt coincided with the end of the East India Company's rule in India and the British Crown's direct rule over the whole of India began for the next 90 years

 In the post-war treaty, the British got the right to tax-free trade in Bengal
 san 1764 main baxur kaa yuddh jeetne ke baad angrejon kaa bengal par puri tarah se adhikaar ho gaya
 The victory in these two wars greatly increased the strength of the British and proved their military capability superior to the traditional Indian military capability
 company ne iske baad saare bharat par apana prabhaav failaana aarambh kar diya
 In 1843, the East India Company took possession of the Sindh region after a bloody battle
 san 1839 main maharaja ranjit singh kii mrityu ke baad kamjor hue punjab par angrejon ne apana haath badhaaya or san 1848 main doosraa angrej-sikh yuddh hua

 san 1857 ke vidroh ke vibhinn rajnatik, aarthik, dharmik, sainik tathaa saamaajik kaaran bataaye jate he Many historians believe that there was a belief in the public at that time that the British want to Christianize them by force or deception
 yah puri tarah se galat bhi nahin tha, kuch company adhikari dharm parivartan ke kaary main jute the
 However the company never approved the conversion
 company is baat se avgat thi ki dharm, parmparik bhartiya samaaj main vidroh kaa ek kaaran ban saktaa he
 Earlier, one of the reasons for the decline of the Portuguese from India and Japan in the sixteenth century was that they had tried to force Christianity on the masses
 lord dalhousie kii rajya hadapney kii naati ke antargat anek rajya jaise jhansi, avadh, satara, nagpur or sambalpur ko angreji rajya main mila liya gaya or inke uttaradhikari raja se angreji rajya se pension paane vaale karmchaaree ban gayi
 The royal families, zamindars and armies found themselves unemployed and marginalized
 ye log angrejon ke haathon apni sharmindagi or haar kaa badla lene ke liye taiyaar the
 In the eight years of Lord Dalhousie's rule, the area of one million square miles was taken over by the company

 bhartiya, company ke kathor shashan se bhi naaraaz the jo ki teji se fail rahaa tha or pashchimi sabhyta kaa prasar kar rahaa tha
 The British outlawed many of the customs of Hindus and Muslims at that time which were considered antisocial by the British
 isamen sati pratha par roak lagaana shaamil tha
 It is worth noting here that the Sikhs had stopped this long ago and the famous social reformer of Bengal, King Rammohan Roy was campaigning in favor of discontinuing the practice
 in kanoonon ne samaaj ke kuch pakshon mukhyatah bengal main krodh utpann kar diya
 The British abolished child marriage and also prohibited female feticide
 angrejon dwaara thagi kii samaapti bhi kii gai parantu yah sandeh abhi bhi bana hua he ki thag ek dharmik samudaay tha yaa keval saadhaaran dakaiton kaa samudaay
 The British judicial system was considered unjust to Indians
 san 1853 main britain ke pradhanmantri lord abradin ne prashasnic seva ko bharatiyon ke liye khol diya parantu kuch prabud bharatiyon ke hisaab se yah sudhaar paryaapt nahin tha
 The officers of the company were empowered with a number of appeals against Indians in courts
 company bharatiyon par baari kar bhi lagaati thi jise na chukaane kii sthiti main unki sampatti adhigrahit kar lee jaati thi
 Modernization efforts of the company were viewed with suspicion in traditional Indian society
 logo ne mana ki railway jo bambai se sarvapratham chalaa ek daanav he or logo par vipatti laayegaa
 But many historians also believe that these reforms have been exaggerated because the company did not have the means to implement these reforms and their influence away from Calcutta was negligible
 1857 ke vidroh kaa ek pramukh kaaran company dwaara bharatiyon kaa aarthik shoshan bhi tha
 The policies of the company completely ended India's traditional economy
 in nitiyon ke kaaran bahut se kisaan, karigar, shramik or kalakaar kangaal ho gayi
 Along with them the situation of the landlords and big farmers also got worse
 san 1813 main company ne ek tarafa mukt vyapaar kii niti apana lee iske antargat britani vyapaariyon ko aayaat karne kii puri chhot mil gayi, paramparaagat takanic se bani hui bhartiya vasteen iske saamne tik nahin saki or bhartiya shahari hastshilp vyapaar ko acolpaneey kshati hui
 With the arrival of the railway service, small enterprises in the rural areas were also destroyed
 rail seva ne britani vyapaariyon ko dur daraaj ke gaavon tak pahunch de di
 The textile industry suffered the most
 iske saath loha vyapaar, bartan, kaanch, kaagaj, dhaatu, bandook, jahaaj or rangareji ke udyogon ko bhi bahut kshati hui
 In the 18th and 19th centuries, Indian exports came to an end due to import tax and many barriers in Britain and Europe
 parmparik udyogon ke nasht hone or saath saath aadhunik udyogon kaa vikaas na hone kii kaaran yah sthiti or bhi visham ho gayi
 The general public has no means other than farming
 kheti karne vaale kisaano kii haalat bhi kharaab thi

 "according to his disciples, even on the last day of life, on the 4th of July 1902, he did not change his meditation routine and meditated for two to three hours in the morning and meditated on his Brahmarandhra and took Mahasamadhi
 belur main ganga tat par chandan kii chita par unki antyeshti kii gayi

 Swami Vivekananda Macaulay was opposed to the English education system prevalent at that time, because the purpose of this education was only to increase the number of babus
 vah aisi shiksha chaahate the jisase balak kaa sarvangin vikaas ho sake
 The aim of a child's education is to make him self-sufficient and stand on his feet
 swami vivekananda ne prachlit shiksha ko 'nishedhaatmak shiksha' kii sangya dete hue kaha he ki aap us vyakti ko shikshit maanate hai jisane kuch parikshaayen uteern kar lee hon tathaa jo achche bhaashan de saktaa ho, par vaastaviktaa yah he ki jo shiksha jansadharan ko jivan sangharsh ke liye taiyaar nahin karti, jo charitra nirmaan nahin karti, jo samaaj seva kii bhaavana viksit nahin karti tathaa jo sher jaisaa saahas paidaa nahin kar sakati, aisi shiksha se kya laabh? Therefore, Swamiji was not in favor of theoretical education, he considered practical education useful to the person
 vyakti kii shiksha hi use bhavishya ke liye taiyaar karti he, isliye shiksha main un tatwon kaa hona aavashyak he, jo uske bhavishya ke liye mahatvapurn ho
 In the words of Swami Vivekananda , swami ji shiksha dwaara loukik evam parloukik donon jivan ke liye taiyaar karnaa chaahate hai
 In relation to education from a secular point of view, he has said that 'we need such education, which constitutes character, increases the strength of the mind, develops the intellect and makes the person self-reliant
 ' parloukik drushti se unhone kaha he ki 'shiksha manushya kii anternihit purnataa kii abhivyakti he
 ' swami vivekananda ke shiksha darshan ke aadharbhoot siddhanth nimnlikhit hai – 1
 Education should be such that the physical, mental and spiritual development of the child can be done
 2
 shiksha aisi ho jisase balak ke charitra kaa nirmaan ho, man kaa vikaas ho, buddhi viksit ho tathaa balak aatmanirbhan bane
 3
 Both boys and girls should be given equal education
 4
 dharmik shiksha, pustakon dwaara na dekar aacharan evam sanskaron dwaara deni chahie
 5
 Both temporal and otherworldly subjects should be given place in the syllabus
 6

 7

 8

 kai antarrashtriya sanghathanon or rashtramandal deshon main bade paimaane par iskaa istemaal ek dwitiya bhashaa or adhikarik bhashaa ke rup main hota he
 Historically, the English language has its origins in several dialects, now called Old English, introduced by the anglo-saxon people who settled in England since the early 5th century
 viking hamalaavaron kii pracheen norse bhashaa kaa angreji bhashaa par gaharaa prabhaav padaa he

 vahaan se aadhunik angreji kaa vikaas hua or abhi bhi isamen anek bhashaaon se videshi shabdon ko apnaane or saath hi saath nae shabdon ko gadhane kii prakriya nirantar jari he
 The formation of a large number of English words, especially technical words, is based on the roots of ancient Greek and Latin
 aadhunik angreji, jisko kabhi - kabhi pratham vaishvik saamaanya bhashaa ke taur par bhi varnit kiya jaataa he,sanchaar, vigyaan, vyapaar, vimaanan, manoranjan, radio or kootneeti ke kshetron kii pramukh antarrashtriya bhashaa he
 Its expansion beyond the British Isles began with the development of the British Empire and by the end of the 19th century its reach had become truly global
 yah sanyukt rajya america kii pramukh bhashaa he
 Since the Second World War, the recognition of America as a global superpower and its increasing economic and cultural influence has brought significant momentum in the spread of the English language

 According to linguists such as David Crystal, an effect of the widespread spread of English, as has happened with other global languages, appears to reduce the diversity of vernacular languages in many parts of the world, particularly The effect is seen in Australasia and North America, and its enormous impact continues to play an important role in language attrition
 isi prakaar aitihaasi bhashavid, jo kii bhashaa parivartan kii jatilta or gatishiltaa se avgat hai, angreji bhashaa dwaara alag bhashaaon ke ek nae parivaar kaa nirmaan karne kii isaki aseem sambhaavnaaon ke prati hameshaa avgat rahete hai
 According to these linguists, the reason for this is the huge size of the English language and the spread of communities using it and its natural internal diversity, such as its creoles and pizzins 
o english ek west jarmenic bhashaa he jisaki utpatti anglo-fritian or loar sexn boliyon se hui he
 These dialects were brought to Britain in the 5th century by German nomads and Roman auxiliary armies from various parts of present-day northwestern Germany and northern Netherlands
 in jarmenic janajatiyon main se ek thi engles, jo sambhawatah angton se aaye the

 haalaanki boli main sarvaadhik mahatvapurn parivartan 1066 ke norman akraman ke pashchaat hi aaye, parantu bhashaa ne apane naam ko banaaye rakhaa or norman akraman purv kii boli ko ab puraani angreji kaha jaataa he
 Initially Old English was a group of diverse dialects that reflected the diversity of the anglo-saxon states of Great Britain
 inamen se ek boli, let west sexn, antat apana varchasv sthapit karne main safal hui
 mul puraani angrezi bhashaa phir akraman kii do laharon se prabhavit hui
 pehla jarmenic parivaar ke uttari jarmenic shakha ke bhashaa bolne waalon dwaara tha; unhone 8 veen or 9 veen sadi main british dwipon ke kuch hisson ko jitkar upnivesh bana diya
 doosraa 11 veen sadi ke normans the, jo kii puraani norman bhashaa bolte the or isaki anglo-norman namak ek angreji kism kaa vikaas kiya
 The English became somewhat "mixed" due to these two attacks
 scandinaviens ke saath sahanivaas ke parinamswaroop angreji bhashaa ke anglo-frisian kor kaa shabdic anupuran hua; baad ke norman kabje ke parinamswaroop bhashaa ke germanik kor kaa sundarikaran hua, isamen romance bhashaaon se kai sundar shabdon ko samavisht kiya gaya
 This Norman influence entered English mainly through the courts and the government
 is prakaar, angreji ek "udhaar" kii bhashaa ke rup main viksit hui jisamen lacheelaapan or ek vishaal shabdaawalee thi
 The rise and expansion of the British Empire as well as the emergence of the United States as a great power resulted in the spread of English throughout the world
 paanchavin or chhathi sadi main britain ke dwipon par uttar kii ore se angel or sexn qabeelon ne hamalaa kiya tha or unhone keltic bhashaayen bolne vaale sthaneey logon ko scotland, ireland or wales kii ore dhakel diya tha
 Attacks of Vikings and Norse tribes from the north also began in the eighth and ninth centuries, and thus the region of present-day England became a country of many language speakers and many old words found new meanings
 jaise – dream kaa arth us samay tak anand lenaa tha lekin uttar ke vikings ne ise sapane kaa arth de diya
 Similarly, the word skirt also came here with the northern attackers
 lekin iskaa rup badal kar shart ho gaya
 Later both the words started to be used in different meanings and are happening till date
 san 500 se lekar 1100 tak ke kaal ko puraani angrezi kaa daur kaha jaataa he
 In 1066, the Duke of Normandy invaded England and conquered the anglo-saxon tribes here

 This period of English continued from 1100 to 1500 and this period of English expansion is called medieval English
 kaanoon or aparaadh-dand se sambandh rakhane vaale bahut se angrezi shabd isi kaal main prachlit hue
 Chaucer's poetry in English literature is said to be an important example of this language
 san 1500 ke baad angrezi kaa aadhunik kaal aarambh hota he jisamen unani bhashaa ke kuch shabdon ne milanaa aarambh kiya
 This period begins in the name of a litterateur like Shakespeare and lasts till 1800

 angreji bhashaa indo-europea bhashaa parivaar ke germanik shakha ke pashchimi up-shakha kii sadsy he
 The only surviving relatives of English have two names, either Scots, spoken mainly in Scotland or parts of Northern Ireland, or Frisian
 Since Scots linguists see either a separate language or a group of dialects of English, Frisian is often said to be the closest relative of English than Scots
 inke baad anya jarmenic bhashaaon kaa number aata he jinka naata thodaa dur kaa he, ve hai, pashchimi europea bhashaayen or uttari jarmenic bhashaayen or farois
 scots or sambhawatah frisian ke apwaad ke sivaa inamen se kisi bhi bhashaa kaa angreji ke saath parsparik mail nahin baithta he
 The reason for this is the difference in word storage, syntax, semantics and phonetic knowledge
 anya jarmenic bhashaaon ke saath angreji ke shabd bhandaran main antar kaa mukhya kaaran angreji main badi maatra main latin shabdon kaa upyog he or french ) german or angreji kaa vaakyavinyas bhi angreji se kaaphi alag he, vaakyon ko banane ke liye alag niyam hai 
 shabdaarth vigyaan angreji or uske sambandhiyon ke bich juthi dostiyon kaa kaaran he
 Differences in phonics also blur basically related words, and sometimes both phonetics and semantics are different
 1500 sau se zyada varshon se angreji main yogic shabdon ke nirmaan or maujuuda shabdon main sudhaar kii kriya apane alag andaaj main, germanik bhashaaon se pruthak, chal rahi he
 For example, abstract nouns can be formed by adding suffixes like -hood, -ship, -dom, -ness to native words in English
 lagbhag sabhi jarmenic bhashaaon main in sabhi ke sajaateey pratyay maujuud hai lekin unke upyog bhinn ho gaye hai, jaise kii german "free-hit" banaam angreji "free-dam" An English speaker can also read many French words easily because there is a large amount of adjustment of French and Norman words in English
 yah samaayojan norman vijay ke baad anglo-norman bhashaa se or baad kii sadiyon main sidhe french bhashaa se shabdon ko uthaane ke kaaran he
 As a result, a large part of the English vocabulary comes from the French language, with some minor spelling differences and differences in the meanings of so-called false friends
 The English pronunciation of most French single words is fully Englishized and follows a specific English method of emphasis

 british samrajya ke vistaar or dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad se america ke prabhutv ke kaaran duniya bhar main angreji kaa prasar hua
 This global spread led to the development of many English dialects and English-based Creole languages and pejins
 angreji kii do shikshit sthaneey boliyon ko duniya ke adhikansh hisson main ek maanak ke taur par sweekrut kiya jaataa he- ek shikshit dakshini british par aadhaarit he or duusari shikshit madhyapashchimi american par aadhaarit he
 The former is sometimes called BBC English, a clan noted for its inclination towards "received pronunciation"; It follows the Cambridge model
 yah model europe, africa bhartiya upmahadweep or anya kshetron jo kii yaa to british rashtramandal se prabhavit hai yaa phir america ke saath pahachanakrut hone ke unicchuk hai, main anya bhashaaon ko bolne waalon ko angreji sikhaane ke liye ek maanak ke taur par kaam karti he
 The latter dialect, General American, extends to most of the United States and Canada
 yah america mahadwipon or america ke nikat sambandh main rahe athwa uski ichha rakhane vaale kshetron ke liye ek model ke taur par istemaal hoti he
 Apart from these two major dialects, there are several varieties of English, most of which include several sub-types, such as Cockney, Scouse and Geordie under British English; Newfoundland English under Canadian English; And African American Local English and South American English under American English
 English is a multi-centric language and does not have a central language authority like the 'acedimia francai' of France; Therefore, no one type is considered "right" or "wrong"

 Due to the widespread use of English as a second language, there are different types of accents of its speakers, which reveal the local dialect or language of the speaker
 kshetreey lahazon kii adhik vishisht visheshtaon ke liye 'angreji ke kshetreey lahazon' ko dekhen or kshetreey boliyon kii adhik vishisht visheshtaon ke liye angreji bhashaa kii boliyon kii soochi ko dekhen

 Variations in grammar and vocabulary were found throughout the country during the survey of English dialects, but most of the variations have been eliminated due to a process of attrition of word storage

 udahaaran ke taur par, aashcharya athwa vyangy vyakt karnaa, yaa ek vaktavy ko prashn main badalanaa
 In English, intonation patterns occur on a group of words known as tone groups, tone units, intonation groups, or sense groups
 tone samoohon ko ek hi saans main kaha jaataa he, is kaaran se inaki lambaai simit rahati he
 These are on average five words long and are finished in about two seconds
 udhaaharan ke liye : English is a very spoken language
 shabdon or vaakyon, donon ke kuch shabdaanshon ko uccharan ke samay apekshaakrit adhik mahatva / jor miltaa he jabaki anya ko nahin
 pehle prakaar ke shabdaanshon ko axcentuated / stressd kaha jaataa he or baad waalon ko anexentuated / anstroped 
 Thus each tone group in a sentence can be divided into syllables which will be either stressed or unstressed
 The stressed syllable is called the nuclear syllable
 udhaaharan ke liye: Was the best thing you could have done! ' yahaan saare shabdaansh anstroped hai, sivaay best or dan ke, jo kii stressd hai
 The emphasis on BEST is slightly higher, hence the nuclear syllable
 newclear shabdaansh vaktaa ke mukhya bindu kaa varnan karata he
 for example: yah bhi It can also be used to express emotion: newclear shabdaanshon ko zyada unche swar main bolaa jaataa he or inako bolne ke lahaze main ek vishisht badlaav hota he
 The most common variations of this tone are the raising of the voice and lowering of the voice, although the falling voice and the falling sound are also used occasionally
 anya bhashaaon kii apeksha angreji bhashaa main aawaaj ko unchaa or nicha karne kaa mahatva kahin adhik he
 Speaking in a low voice indicates certainty and speaking in a loud voice indicates uncertainty
 This can have a significant impact on meaning, especially in showing positive or negative attitudes; Speaking in a low voice means your "point of view" and a rising voice means "point of view"
 haan / nahin vaale prashnon kii chadhati hui aawaaj ke peeche bhi yahi he
 for example: swar prayek kshetra main bhinn bhinn hote hai
 Where symbols are visual in pairs, the first corresponds to the common American pronunciation of American English, the second corresponds to the received pronunciation of British English
 yah angreji vyanjan pranali he jo antarrashtriya dhvanyatmak varnmaala se pratikon kaa prayog kar rahi he

 These words include basic pronouns such as "I, from the Old English word ic, m, numbers", duo, tris), common family relationships such as mother, father, brother, sister etc
, many animal names and many common Activities jarmenic shabd angreji ke latin shabdon se zyada chote hote hai or saamaanya bolchaal main inkaa upyog zyada aam he
 It includes almost all the basic pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, denotative verbs etc
 that make up the basic syntax and grammar of English
 lambe latin shabdon ko aksar zyada alankrita or shikshit mana jaataa he
 However, excessive use of Latin words is considered to be an attempt to show off or hide the issue

 This essay is considered an important review of the English language

 kuch maamalon main, ek jarmenic vyutpann shabd, ek latin vyutpann shabd or samaan latin shabd se vyutpann ek french shabd main se chayan karne kaa vikalp rahata he

 Most Latin words are commonly used in formal speech or writing, such as a court or an encyclopedic article
 However, there are other Latin words that are commonly used in general colloquial and do not appear to be too formal; These words are primarily for concepts that no Germanic word has survived

 The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition contains more than 6 million definitions, following the overall policy: It embraces not only the standard language of literature and conversation, whether current at the moment, or obsolete, or archaic, but also the main technical vocabulary, and a large measure of dialectal usage and slang 
 The editors of Webster's third new international dictionary, without layoffs, estimate this number to be much higher in his preface
 aisa anumaan he kii lagbhag 25,000 shabd har saal bhashaa main judate hai
 One consequence of the French influence is that the English vocabulary has been somewhat divided into Germanic and Latin words
 angreji ke 1000 sabase aam shabdon main se 83% or 100 sabase aam main se puure 100 jarmenic hai
 Conversely, most of the more advanced words in subjects like science, philosophy, mathematics come from Latin or Greek

 The spelling system, or orthography, is multi-layered

 There is often a considerable difference in the pronunciation and spelling of words
 haalaanki akshar or dhwani algaav main mail nahin khate hai, phir bhi shabd sanrachana, dhwani or lahazon ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaaye gaye vartanee niyam 75% vishwasaneey hai
 Some phonetic spelling advocates claim that English is more than 80% phonetic

 The result of this complex orthographic history is that reading can be a challenging task
 greek, french or spanish or kai anya bhashaaon kii tulana main, ek chaatr ko angreji pathan kaa paarangat banane main zyada vakt lagata he
 Only consonant letters are pronounced in a relatively regular way: adhikansh jarmenic bhashaaon ke vipareet, angreji main dyacritics, sivaay videshi udharshabdon ke, lagbhag nahin ke baraabar hai or do swaron ke uccharan ko ek dhwani kii bajaay pruthak darshane ke liye diarisis nishaan ke asaamaanya upyog main

 Eg, maté, from Spanish yerba mate) duniya bhar ke shikshit angreji vaktaaon dwaara lagbhag saarvbhaumik rup se sweekrut bhashaa ke ek sanskaran ko aupchaarik likhit angreji kaha jaataa he
 Its written type remains the same almost everywhere, in contrast to which the English language differs according to dialects, accents, types of slang, local and regional expressions
 bhashaa ke aupchaarik likhit sanskaran main sthaneey bhinnataayen kaaphi simit hai
 The scope of this variation is limited to the spelling differences of British and American English
 angreji pathan ko asana karne ke liye iske kuch sarlikrut sanskaran bhi maujuud hai
 One of these is Basic English, formed by Charles K
 Ogden with limited words and describes it in his book Basic English: a General Introduction with Rules and Grammar
 yah bhashaa angreji ke ek sarlikrut sanskaran par aadhaarit he
 Ogden said that it would take seven years to learn English, seven months for Esperanto and only seven days for basic English
 Companies that require complex books for international use, as well as schools that teach people basic English in a short period of time, can use Basic English
 ogden ne basic english main aisa koi shabd nahin daalaa jise kuch anya shabdon ke saath bolaa ja sake or anya bhashaaon ke vaktaaon ke liye bhi ye shabd kaam karen, is baat kaa bhi usne khyaal rakhaa

 But as a mother tongue, Hindi and Chinese language has surpassed English
 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200~350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 To worship the son Ratna, he worshiped Shiva and Bhagwati Durga located in Mahishmati Puri

 The astrologers named the son Madansen in naming it
 bhagwaan shiv evam maan durga kii krupa se raja virasen ko putr ratna kii prapti hui
 Inspired by this devotion, the temple of Mother Bamleshwari was built in Kamakhya city
 maan bamleshwari ko jagadamba jisamen bhagwaan shiv arthath maheshwar kii shakti vidyaman he, ke rup me janaa jane laga
 King Madansen was a public servant ruler
 unke putr hue raja kamsen jinke naam par kamakhya nagari kaa naam kamavati puri rakhaa gaya
 Kamakandala and Madhavanal's love story is also an important part of Dongargarh's fame
 kamakandala, raja kamsen ke raaj darbar me nartki thi
 The same Madhavanal used to be an accomplished musician
 ek baar raja ke darbar me kamakandala ke nrity kaa aayojan hua parantu taal evam sur bigadne se madhavanal ne kamakandala ke pair ke ek paayal me nag na hona va mridang bajaane vaale kaa angutha nakli arthath mom kaa hona jaisi truti nikaali
 King Kamsen was very impressed by this and handed over his beads to him and asked him to dance in honor of Madhavanal
 kamakandala ke nrity se prabhavit hokar madhavanal ne raja kamsen kii di hui motiyo kii maala kamakandala ko bhet kar di
 This enraged the king
 unhone madhavanal ko rajya se nikaal diya lekin madhavanal rajya se baahar na jaakar dongargarh kii pahario kii gupha me chhip gaya
 Incidentally, the love had sprouted between Kamakandla and Madhavanal
 kamalandala apni saheli madhavi ke saath chhipakar madhavanal se milane jaaya karti thi
 On the other hand, King Kamsen Kaputra Madanaditya's father was of an atheist nature and contrary to nature
 vah kamakandala ko man hi man chahta tha or use paanaa chahta tha
 Fearing Madanaditya, Kamakandala began to pretend to love him
 ek din madhavanal raatri me kamakandala se milane uske ghar par tha ki usee vakt madanaditya apane sipaahiyo ke saath kamakandala se milane chalaa gaya
 Seeing this, Madhavanal left the path towards the cave
 ghar ke andar awaaje aane kii baat poochhne par kamakandala ne deevaaron se akele me baat karne kii baat kahi
 Madanaditya was not satisfied with this and asked his soldiers to keep an eye on the house and went towards the palace
 ek raatri pahario se veena kii aawaaj sun va kamakandala ko pahari kii taraf jate dekh madanaditya raste me baithkar uski pratiksha karne laga parantu kamakandala duusare raste se apane ghar laut gai
 Madanaditya arrested Kamakandla at her house when she suspected him
 is par kamakandala or madhavanal madhavi ke madhyam se patr vyavhaar karne lage kintu madanaditya ne madhavi ko ek roj patr le jate pakad liya
 Madhavi spurned all the truth due to the temptation of fear and money
 madanaditya ne kamakandala ko rajdroh ke aarope me bandi banaaya uur madhavanal ko pakadney sipaahiyo ko bheja
 Seeing the soldiers coming, Madhavanal ran out of the hill and reached Ujjain
 us samay ujjain me raja vikramaditya kaa shashan tha jo bahut hi pratapi or dayavan raja the
 Hearing the sad story of Madhavanal, thinking of helping Madhavanal, his army attacked Kamakhya city
 kai dino ke ghanghor yudhd ke baad vikramaditya vijayi hue evam madanaditya, madhavanal ke hatho maaraa gaya
 The magnificent Kamakhya city was completely destroyed due to the fierce war
 chaaro ore shesh dongar hi bache rahe tathaa is prakaar dungrajya nagar prishtbhumi taiyaar hui
 After the war, when Vikramaditya spread the false information that Madhavanal Veergati was received in the war to take the test of Kamakandala and Madhavanal, Kamakandala jumped into the rhythm and died
 vah talab aaj bhi kamakandala ke naam se vikhyath he
 On the other hand, Madhavanal also gave up his life due to the self-immolation of Kamakandala
 apana prayojan sidhd hote naa dekh raja vikramaditya ne maan bamleshwari devi kii aradhana kii or atantah pranotsarg karne ko tatpar ho gayi
 The goddess then appeared and prevented her devotee from suicide

 If m { \ displaystyle m} is odd and m <n { \ displaystyle m <n}, then we take s m - s n <am { \ displaystyle S_ {m} -S_ {n} <a_ {m}} as follows Let's know: chunki a n { \ displaystyle a_{n}} ekadishtatah hrasman he atah pad − { \ displaystyle -} rinatmak he
