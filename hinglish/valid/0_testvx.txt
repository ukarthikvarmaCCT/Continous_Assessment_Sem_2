 vibhinn bhashaaon main iske kai naam hai
 Arrowroot in Hindi, bilayati tikhur, arrowroot in Marathi, oraroot in Bengali, tawaksheer, tawkhar in Gujarati, arrowroot; Arroot in English is called West Indian arroot
 ararut athwa ararot ek prakaar kaa starch yaa mand he jo kuch paudhon kii kandil jadon se praapt hota he
 Among them, the common plant named Marentsi clan is the main one
 yah dirghajivi shaakeey paudha he jo mukhyat: ushn deshon main paaya jaataa he
 Food is stored in its roots as starch

 Poet Trilochan is considered to be the major signature of the progressive poetry of Hindi literature
 ve aadhunik hindi kavita kii pragatisheel trayee ke teen stambhon main se ek the
 The other two Satyambhas of this trilogy were Nagarjuna and Shamsher Bahadur Singh
 uttar pradesh ke sultanpur jile ke katgharaa chiraani pattee main jagardev singh ke ghar 20 agast 1917 ko janme trilochan shastri kaa mul naam vasudev singh tha
 He received his MA from Kashi Hindu University
 He received the title of Shastri in English and Sanskrit from Lahore
 uttar pradesh ke sultanpur jile ke chote se gaanv se banaras vishvavidhyalay tak apane safar main unhone darjanon pustaken likhin or hindi sahitya ko samrudh kiya
 Shastri was a staunch opponent of marketism
 haalanki unhone hindi main prayogdharmita kaa samarthan kiya
 He said, the more uses the language has, the richer it will be
 shastri ne hameshaa hi navasrujan ko badhaava diya
 He was a catalyst for new writers
 sagar ke muktibodh srajan peeth par bhi ve kuch saal rahe
 He died on 9 December 2007 in Ghaziabad
 trilochan shastri hindi ke atirikt arabi or farsi bhashaaon ke nishnaat gyaata maane jate the
 He has also been very active in the field of journalism
 unhone prabhakar, vanar, hans, aaj, samaaj jaisi patr-patrikaon kaa sampadan kiya
 Trilochan Shastri was also the National President of Jan Sanskriti Manch from 1995 to 2001
 iske alaava varanasi ke gyanmandal prakaashan sanstha main bhi kaam karte rahe or hindi va urdu ke kai shabdkoshon kii yojana se bhi jude rahe
 He is known as the master of Hindi sonnets
 unhone is chand ko bhartiya parivesh main dhaala or lagbhag 550 sonet kii rachana kii
 Apart from this, he also enriched Hindi literature with story, songs, ghazals and criticism
 unka pehla kavita sangrah dharti 1945 main prakashit hua tha
 Rose and Bulbul, i am the poet of that district and their famous poetry collection on the fresh day of summer
 digant or dharti jaisi rachanaaon ko kalambaddh karne vaale trilochan shastri ke 17 kavita sangrah prakashit hue
 Trilochan left a distinct mark in language style and content
 trilochan ne vahi likhaa jo kamazor ke paksh main tha
 He was a distant voice of the toiling and downtrodden society
 unki kavita bharat ke gram or dehaat samaaj ke us nimna varg ko sambodhit thi jo kahin dabaa tha kahi jag rahaa tha kahin sankoch main padaa tha
 i am a poet of the district who is hungry, hungry, ignorant i am not aware that art does not know what it is, it does not believe trilochan ne lok bhashaa avadhi or pracheen sanskrit se prerana lee, isliye unki vishistataa hindi kavita kii paramparaagat dhara se judi hui he
 The funny thing is that due to being so closely associated with his tradition, he had the beauty and taste of modernity
 pragatisheel dhara ke kavi hone ke kaaran trilochan marxvaadi chetana se sampann kavi the, lekin is chetana kaa upyog unhone apane dhang se kiya
 His poems apparently do not speak of the Left ideology in the same way as the poems of Nagarjuna or Kedarnath Agarwal
 trilochan ke bheetar vichaaron ko lekar koi badbolapan bhi nahin tha
 a belief floated everywhere in his writing that only the public would play the revolutionary role of change
 vaise to unhone geet, ghazal, sonet, kundaliyaan, barbai, mukt chand jaise kavita ke tamaam madhyamon main likhaa, lekin sonet ke kaaran vah zyada jane gaye
 He was the son of Sonnet in modern Hindi poetry
 hindi main sonet ko vijaateey mana jaataa tha
 But Trilochan Indianised it
 iske liye unhone rola chand ko aadhaar banaaya tathaa bolchaal kii bhashaa or lay kaa prayog karte hue chatushpadi ko lokrang main rangane kaa kaam kiya
 The compositions he composed in this verse were probably not done by poets like Spencer, Milton, and Shakespeare
 sonet ke jitne bhi rup-bhed sahitya main kiye gaye hai, un sabhi ko trilochan ne aajamaaya
 Trilochan Shastri was awarded the Shalaka Samman by the Hindi Academy in 1989–90
 hindi sahitya main utkrisht yogadan ke liye unhe 'shastri' or 'sahitya ratna' jaise oopaadhiyon se sammanit kiya ja chukaa he
 He also received the Sahitya Akademi Award for the day of Taape in 1982
 iske alaava unhen uttar pradesh hindi samiti puraskaar, hindi santhaan sammaan, maithilisharan gupt sammaan, shalaka sammaan, bhavani prasad mishra rashtriya puraskaar, sulabh sahitya academy sammaan, bhartiya bhashaa parishad sammaan aadi se bhi sammanit kiya gaya tha

 Their worship leads to increase in tenacity, sacrifice, quietness, virtue, self-control

 With the grace of Goddess Brahmacharini, she attains perfection and victory everywhere

 In this period, an attempt was made to establish a system based on communist ideals
 yuddh samyawad ke tahat bhoomi, kisaanon or jameendaaron se chhinakar rajya kii ghoshit kar di gai or phir usko kisaanon main baant diya gaya
 The government adopted a policy of forcibly taking grain from the farmers, the farmer was obliged to give the entire production to the government, except his edible grains

 Thus private trade also stopped
 banking pranali bhi avyavasthit ho gai, kyaaki sarkaar ne vastu vinium pranali par bal diya
 Similarly, the system of war communism was run with terror and arbitrariness
 is shashan vyavastha main roosi janata ko mili kashton se rus main asantosh vyaapt tha jo ek ke baad ek kai krishak vidrohon ke rup main saamne aayaa
 Not only this, the navalists also revolted

 Therefore, Lenin, realizing the seriousness of the situation, brought a new economic policy in place of the warring communism to remove the causes of dissatisfaction and economic reconstruction of Russia
 videshi hamalon or bhitari shadyantron ke kaaran rus ko bade jabardast aarthik sankat kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In 1917, Lenin nationalized all the means of production, but in many industries, production began to decrease rather than increase, agricultural production was reduced to half and there was a huge shortage of essential commodities
 in bheeshan paristhitiyon se nipatane ke liye lenin ne 1921 i
 main ek nai aarthik niti apanaai jise 'nai aarthik niti' kaha jaataa he
 This economic policy was in agreement with Marxist principles because the position of capitalists was also preserved in it
 bolshevik sarkaar ne nai aarthik niti main rashtrikaran ke saath-saath poonjivadi vyavastha ko bhi prashray diya
 Those small factories in which less than twenty laborers worked were allowed to remain in the hands of their owners and the capitalists were also given freedom to sell their produce
 niti ke parinamswaroop rus ke udyog dhandhon kaa kayakalp hua or utpaadan bhi badha
 The compulsory recovery of their surplus produce from the farmers was stopped and agricultural production was taxed instead

 The Achollers considered it a surrender of the Bolshevik government to the capitalist
 yah baat satya he ki nai aarthik niti yuddhrat samyawad kii niti se bhinn thi kyonki isse antargat kuch anshon main poonjivadi vyavastha ko sweekaar kiya gaya tha
 But Lenin did not consider it a surrender of the Bolshevik government to capitalism
 uski drushti se nai aarthik niti bolshevik rajya kii shakti or raajnneetik namaneeyata kaa lakshan maatr thi
 In fact Lenin was a firm Marxist and was adopting this realistic policy
 usne mahasoos kiya tha ki samyawad ko bachaane or shaktishaalee dhang se aage badhaane keliye thodaa sa poonjeevaad ko apnaanaa padegaa
 In this context, Lenin said, "to take two steps forward, steps must be taken
" " arthath do kadam aage badhkar ek kadam peeche hatana ek tareeke se ek kadam aage rahane ke baraabar he
 His idea was that when the economic system improves, the government will re-establish a communist system and this was also seen during the time of Stalin
 nai aarthik niti kaa uddeshy shramik varg or krishakon ke aarthik sahyog ko sudrudh bananaa, nagaron tathaa graamon ke samast shramjivi varg ko desh kii arthvyavastha kaa vikaas karne ke liye protsaahit karnaa tathaa arthvyavastha ke pramukh tantron kaa shashan ke adhikaar main rakhte hue aanshik rup main poonjivadi vyavastha ko kaary karne kii anumati dena tha
 The "new economic policy" brought stability to the economic sphere, strengthening the currency pattern, agricultural production and industrial production
 is tarah rus kaa aarthik vikaas hua
 In this regard, David Thomson wrote that one of the most dramatic and far-reaching effects of this policy was that the reconstruction of Russia was possible as a result of economic policy
 lenin ne aarthik niti ke sandarbh main jo baaten kahi bhi vah sahi sabit hui, ki rus jab aarthik rup se sakasham ho jayega to samyavaadee vyavastha purnatah shashakt tareeke se sthapit ho jaaegi
 The Bolshevik Party abandoned it after Lenin's death after 1925 and implemented stricter communist policies

 Legal awareness or legal literacy is intended to empower the public by familiarizing them with the general matters related to law
 vidhik jaagrukta se vidhik samskruti ko badhaava miltaa he, kanoonon ke nirmaan main logon kii bhagidaari badhati he or kanoon ke shashan kii sthapana kii disha main pragati hoti he
 Earlier, being 'legally literate' meant 'ability to write / read legal documents, opinions, judgments, laws etc
'
 kintu ab iskaa arth kanoon se sambandhit itani kshamta se he jo kisi kanoonee samaaj main arthpurna jivan jeene ke liye jaruri ho
 Some of the disadvantages due to legal illiteracy- vastav main vaadakari ko yogya nyaayadhishon, susajjit nyaay kakshon, vidwaan adhivaktaa samudaay evam nyaayik mimasha se koi sarokaar nahin hota he, balki uski sthiti ek biimaar vyakti kii tarah hoti he jo sheeghra se sheeghra is beemaari se nidaan paanaa chahta he
 The legal saying is that ignorance of the law is not a defense
 arthath jaise hi koi kanoon prabhaav main aata he, yah avadharana sthapit ho jaati he ki prayek sambandhit jan ko is kanoon kii jaankaree he, jabaki vyavhaarik pahalu bhinn he
 For example, it has become common to have an unknown vehicle accident on the roads

 But ever since X-rays, anesthesia, and armaments have progressed, these disciplines have become a specialized department of surgery and now the deformities of bone and organs are corrected with large or small armaments
 na keval yahi, apitu viklang shishuon ore un baalkon ke, jinke ang tede-medhe ho jate hai yaa janm se hi purnataya viksit nahin hote, angon ko thik karke upyogi bananaa, upyogi kaamon ko karne uskaa pun:sthaapan karnaa, jisase vah samaaj kaa upyogi ang ban sake or apana jivicoparjan kar sake, ye sab aayojan or praytn is vidya ke dhyey hai
 Fracture, dislocation and other deformities are treated with these two actions
 hastsaadhan kaa arth he toote hue yaa apane sthaan se hate hue bhaagon ko haathon dwaara hilaa dulaakar unako swaabhaavik sthiti main le aana
 Stabilization means immovable parts by bringing them to their place so that they cannot be removed again
 pehle lakdi yaa khapachi yaa lohe ke kankal tathaa anya isi prakaar kii vastuon se sthirikaran kiya jaataa tha, kintu ab plaster ov paris kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jo pani main saanakar chop dene par pathar ke samaan kadaa ho jaataa he

 When the third Kunwar Rawatsinhji ruled in Bhiligarh, his son and Kunwar Vejalsinghji's best friend of Bhiligadh invited Rajavi Punjaji Chavane of Gujarat to extend his kingdom, then Vejalsinghji came to Gujarat with his army and joined the Chavada dynasty with Garh Manasa, Garh Varsora and Garh Dangarwada
 The dynasty ruled and fought with them and won between Punjaji and Vejalsinghji
 According to a treaty, in order to give a stronghold to Dabhi Rajputs, in the end, at the Dangarwa, Vejalsinghji laid the foundation of the royalty along with fourteen villages of Dabhi dynasty
 haraa gandhak bacteria yaa chlorobiasi avikalpi avayujeevi prakaashahari bacteria kaa ek jeevvaigyanik kul he
 These, together with Ignavibacteriaceae, define a biological association called total chlorobi
 hare gandhak bacteria agatisheel or anoxijani prakashasanshleshan main sakasham swaposhi hote hai
 In this clan, only one species, chloroherpetone thalasium, is in motion
 jahaan paudhe prakashasanshleshan main oxigen aayan ko electron daata ke rup main prayog karte hai, vahaan hare gandhak bacteria gandhak aayan kaa prayog karte hai
 It is often found in deep sea areas where sunlight reaches a small amount
 likene nimna shrenee kii aisi choti vanaspatiyon kaa ek samooh he, jo vibhinn prakaar ke aadhaaron par uge hue paae jate hai
 The leaves and bark of trees, ancient walls, ground, rocks and rocks are the main ones in these grounds
 yadhyapi ye adhiktar dhaval rang ke hote hai, tathaapi laal, naarangi, bangnee, nile evam bhure tathaa anya chittkarshak rangon ke likene bhi paae jate hai
 Their growth is slow and there is a considerable variation in their size and shape
 in paudhon kaa vanaspatik sharir ek thelas hota he, jo purnataya jad, pattee or shakharahit heta he
 The community of lichens can be mainly divided into three types of bags: kuch chapata or uthaa hua; Like the leaf, in which both the upper and the inner surface are clear enough and dhwaja kii bhanti, jo urdhwadhar disha main vyavasthit hota he
 These three types of classes are called Perpetual, Pernil, and Xupil lichen respectively
 parptimay likene chapate or patale hote hai tathaa vriksh kii chaal, yaa shilaon se chipke hue ugte hai
 Most of them have some part inside the base and they look like brown stripes and dots on the base
 inaki vibhinn jatiyaan aadhaar ke rang se milti hai, at: ye chattan ke samaan hi dikhaai detii he
 Pernyl lichen are like twisted leaves, which have mounts
 ye patale patale mulabhaason kii sahaayta se shilaon, yaa shakhaon se chipke rahete hai
 Radixes originate from their lower surface
 kshupil likene atyadhik vibhajit belanaakaar tathaa feete kii bhanti hote hai, jo apane ad: str se aadhaarik bhaag dwaara dhwaja kii bhanti jude hote hai
 All lichens are adipose, not parasitic
 ye apane parposhi par keval sahare ke liye hi ashrith hote hai
 In fact lichen is a duplex plant composed of two completely different flora
 in vanaspatiyon main se ek he shaiwal or doosraa he kavak, kintu in donon main itnaa nikatatam saahchary hota he ki inase bana likene ek hi paudha prathit hota he
 This association mostly consists of fungi, which cover like a bag over the algae organ and is responsible for the shape of the thallus
 donon vanaspatiyon kii mishrit vruddhi se hi likene ko ek vishesh aakaar or aantar sanrachana praapt hoti he, jisase likene kai kul or jatiyon main vibhakt ho jate hai
 About 400 descendants and 15,000 species are known
 likene kaa mukhya bhaag kavak tantuon se hi nirmit hota he, jo reshon kii ek jaali sa bana hota he
 This lattice is often the botanical part of the fungi of Ascomycetes class
 kuch main kavak basidiomicitis varg kaa bhi hota he
 The upper layer of lichen consists of chlorophyceae, or blue-green vegetation, mixed with these fungal fibers, belongs to the mixophysi class
 yah nile, yaa hare rang kii vanaspati eckoshik tathaa bahukoshik tantuvat hoti he
 These flora contain croococcus, cytonema or nostock etc
 kavak ke bhaag or swaroop ke anusaar likene ko do virgon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he : Ascolycanese - The fungal part of this is the unit of the class of Ascomycetes
 basidiolaikenez - isamen kavak bhaag basidiomicitis varg kaa ekak hota he
 Ascolycane can then be divided into two parts on the same plaque designation: the palindromy, which contains the perithecium and the pectoralis, the resulting portion of which is the pectoral apothecium
 adhikansh parnil likene kii aantarik sanrachana nimnlikhit chaar utakon main vibhakt hoti he : Vulcuts, which are often made of vertical armor formulas that do not have spaces in between, or if they are, are filled with synovial material
 shaiwal str thik valkut ke neeche hota he
 In this, green cells of algae are found in entangled fungal formulas
 is str ko kanistar bhi kehete hai
 The medulla is below the algae layer and is made up of loose and entangled fungal formulas
 ad: valkut, ghaney kavak sutron se nirmit hota he or yah sabase neeche kaa str hota he
 Radixes are produced from the lower surface of the sub-vulcanum
 ye thelas ko aadhaar se jodne kaa kaam dete hai tathaa khanij lavan or jal kaa sanvaahan karte hai
 The fulvous lichen does not have a semi-vulcanus, and most of the saccule lichen sacs have an outcrop, with the algae level below it and a median axis below it
 likene ke bheetar nihit shaiwal adhikanshat: bahari ugnevaale shaiwalon se abhinn hote hai
 Their cells contain green color, with the help of which they make food, but as long as the algae are part of the lichen, they do not form the reproduction
 kavak koshikaon main bhi vruddhi kii gati kam hoti he
 These fungi become unfit for independent living
 likene vishwa bhar main faile hue hai
 Most of these are able to survive even in extreme extremes of temperature and long-term, so they are found abundantly in areas where other vegetation cannot grow
 ye samudri tal se adhik oonchaai par ushn pradesh, dhruv pradesh, registan evam jal sthanon par paae jate hai
 Rarely lichen are found under water, of which the algae called Hydrotheria venosa is the most bizarre
 adhik thandi jalwaayu main likene shailarohi ban jate hai, arthath apana jivan chattaanon, yaa shilaon par vyateet karte hai
 But in the equatorial regions, they remain vulcanic, that is, they have bark of tree trunk and branches
 kuch likene sthalarohi or kuch samudr main bhi hote hai
 Small communities are found in their large classes, whose division depends on the nature of the bark, the nature of the soil, the characteristics of the rock and the temperature, humidity and exposure
 kuch likene upjau bhoomi par ugte hai, jahaan anya vanaspatiyaan bhi prachur maatra main hoti hai
 But they never grow near big cities, because the smoke of factories and other gases etc
 around cities are fatal for them
 ye vaayu kii swatchta par vishesh nirbhar karte hai
 Only in clean air can there be a significant increase of lichen
 yadhyapi likene ke ugane ke liye prakaash aavashyak he, tathaapi kuch jatiyaan aise sthanon main bhi ug sakati hai jahaan purnataya andhkaar hota he, jaise phisia bscura 
 The color of the thallus depends on the intensity of the light rays
 likene ke thelas ke sookhne par shaiwal koshikaon kaa haraa rang kavak sutron se chhipe rahane ke kaaran aspasht ho jaataa he
 The color of humid lichen is green, because the light is transmitted by the fibers inside it, making the green color of the algae clear
 kai laikenon kaa rang vishesh chittkarshak hota he
 These colors are due to various organic acids, which help to hang the lichens but at the same time make them unattractive to eat
 jab sarvapratham likene kii vanavat or sanrachana kii khoj kii gai tab in shaiwal koshikaon kii upasthiti ek paheli thi, kyonki ye shesh thelas se bahut bhinn thim
 Some students of lichen, considering these green objects as an integral part of the lichen plant, have expressed the idea that they originated from colorless fungal fibers
 kuch visheshgyon ne inhen prajnan kaa ang mana he tathaa kuch ne inhen bhojan banane ke angon ke rup main sweekaar kiya he
 Schwedner first presented evidence that this green vegetation is algae that have been stained and parasitized by fungal fibers
 is siddhant kii pariksha upyukt shaiwal tathaa kavak ko milakar likene kaa sanshleshan hone par kii gai
 If both parts of the lichen are separated, the algae organ can live independently, but the fungal organ cannot survive when depopulated
 jab yah purnataya siddh kar liya gaya ki likene kaa sharir do vanaspatiyon se bana he, jo kramash: shaiwal or kavak hai, tab likene ke visheshgyon kaa dhyaan in donon bhaagon ke sabandh kii ore aakarshith hua jiske liye vidwaanon ne alag alag naam or vyoraa diya he
 Some compare lichen to a facultative, in which an algae is related to a fungus
 is prakaar ke sambandh se donon ko hi paraspar laabh pahunchataa he tathaa is prakaar ke jivan ko sahjinan kehete hai
 In this, each part performs some physical works that can benefit the other
 shaiwal ang apane hare rang ke padaarthon kii upasthiti se bhojan banane kaa sampurna kaary karata he
 The fungus is completely incapable of doing this task and the fungus also receives food that is made by the algae organ
 duusari ore kavak bhaag ke mulabhas, khanij lavan or jal pravaahit karne ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai tathaa kavak hi shaiwal bhaag kii adhik shushkta, nami, thand or taap se raksha bhi karte hai
 According to the views of some botanists, it is harmful for one, despite having a mutual benefit relationship
 kuch vidwaanon ke matanusaar yah parjivita kaa udhaaharan he, jisamen shaiwal bhaag kavak ke dwaara peedit hota he
 Any isolated portion of lichen can grow freely in the proper environment
 kuch likene janan ke liye ek vishesh prakaar ke ang banaate hai, jinhen psoridia kehete hai
 These are small segments of the thallus, in which one or two algae cells are covered by fungal fibers
 yah paitruk thailason se tuutane ke pashchaat vaayu, varsha yaa jantuon dwaara uchit vaataavaran main pahunchakar naveen paudhe banaate hai

 tyagaraj bhaktimargi kavi evam karnataka sangeet ke mahaan sangitajna the
 He enriched art along with society and literature
 ve bahumukhi pratibha ke dhani the
 He composed hundreds of devotional songs which were in praise of Lord Rama and his best songs Pancharatna are often sung in religious events
 thanjavur jile ke tiruvarur main chaar may 1767 ko paidaa hue tyagaraj kii maa kaa naam sitamma or pita kaa rambrahmam tha
 He says in one of his works - "sitamma Mayamma Sri Ramudu Ma Tandri"
 iske geet ke jariye shaayad vah do baaten kahana chaahate hai
 On the one hand, he tells about the real parents, on the other hand he shows his faith towards Lord Rama
 ek achche susanskrit parivaar main paidaa hue or paley bade tyagaraj prakand vidwaan or kavi the
 He was a scholar of Sanskrit astrology and his mother tongue Telugu
 tyagaraj ke liye sangeet ishwar se saakshaatkaar kaa maarg tha or unke sangeet main bhakthi bhav vishesh rup se ubhar kar saamne aayaa he
 His attachment to music was from childhood
 kam umr main hi vah venkatarmanaiya ke shishy ban gaye or kishoravastha main hi unhone pehle geet 'namo namo raghav' kii rachana kii
 Tyagaraja's compositions, which have contributed to the development of South Indian classical music, are very popular even today and he is very well sung in religious events and programs organized in honor of Tyagaraja 
 tyagaraj ne muttuswami dikshit or shyamasasthri ke saath karnataka sangeet ko nayi disha di or unke yogadan ko dekhte hue unhen trimurti kii sangya di gayi
 The Thanjavur king was greatly influenced by his musical talent and also invited him to join the court
 lekin prabhu kii upasna main duube tyagaraj ne unke aakarshak prastaav ko asweekaar kar diya
 He rejected the king's proposal and wrote the famous work 'nidhi Chal Sukham' ie whether wealth can bring happiness
 kaha jaataa he ki tyagaraj ke bhai ne bhagwaan ram kii vah murti paas hi kaveri nadi main phenk di thi jisaki vah archana karte the
 Tyagaraja could not tolerate the separation from his isht and left the house
 is kram main unhone dakshin bharat ke lagbhag sabhi pramukh mandiron kii yatra kii or un mandiron ke devataaon kii stuti main geet banaae
 Tyagaraja wrote two plays in Telugu, Prahlad Bhakti Vijay and Nauka Charitam, besides producing about 600 works
 prahlaad bhakthi vijay jahaan paanch drishyon main 45 kritiyon kaa naatak he vahiin nauka charitam ekanki he or isamen 21 kritiyaan hai
 Tyagaraja's scholarship is reflected in his every work, although the Pancharatna work is said to be his best work
 sainkadon geeton ke alaava unhone utsav sampradaay kirtanam or divyanam kirtanam kii bhi rachanaaen kii
 He also composed songs in Sanskrit although most of his songs are in Telugu
 tyagaraj kii rachanaaon ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki unamem sab kuch apane sarvshereshth rup main he
 No part of it is unnecessary whether it is music or lyrics
 iske alaava usamen pravaah bhi aisa he jo sangeet pemiyon ko apni ore khinch letaa he
 Spiritually he was among those who did not care about anything in front of devotion
 unhen sirf sangeet evam bhakthi se lagaav tha or ye donon unke liye paryaayavachi the
 No moment of his life was different from Rama

 In the midst of his devotion, he took samadhi on 6 January 1847
 santasahitya kaa is lekh main arth he- vah sahitya jo nirguniye bhakton dwaara rachaa jaae
 It is not necessary that the saint should be called the one who is a worshiper of Nirguna Brahma
 iske antargat lokmagalavidhayi sabhi satpurush aa jate hai, kintu aadhunik katipay sahityakaron ne nirguniye bhakton ko hi "sant" kii abhidha de di or ab yah shabd usee varg main chal padaa he
 The word "saint" is the plural form of the first of the Sanskrit "sat", which means gentleman and religious person
 hindi main sadhu purushon ke liye yah shabd vyavhaar main aayaa
 The old poets like Kabir, Surdas, Goswami Tulsidas etc
 have used this word in the meaning of sage and philanthropist, masculine, and have given its symptoms
 lokopkaaree sant ke liye yah aavashyak nahin ki yah shastrajna tathaa bhashavid ho
 His public interest is the only criterion of his saintliness
 hindi sahityakaron main jo "nirguniye sant" hue unamem adhikansh anpadh kinwa alpashikshit hi the
 Due to not having the basis of classical knowledge, such people were forced to say the same about their experience
 at: inke simit anubhav main bahut si aisi baaten ho sakati hai, jo shastron ke pratikul thahren
 Being sainted, these saints have given importance to the subject and not the language
 inaki bhashaa praaia: angadh or pancharangi ho gai he
 If the importance of expressions in poetry is given importance, then because of the simple and simple expression of true and honest feelings, many of these saints' multifarious compositions can be considered as the right to get a place in the best quality poetry
 paramparaposhit prayek daan kaa aankh muundakar ve samarthan nahin karte
 The shape of his thinking is universalism
 ye maanav maanav main kisi prakaar kaa antar nahin maanate
 They say that no person is born with special features due to his clan
 inaki drushti main vaishishty do baton ko lekar maananaa chahie : abhimaantyagapurvak paroapkaar yaa lokseva tathaa ishwarbhakti
 Thus, in the field of independent thinking, these saints gave birth to an ideological revolution
 nirguniye santon kii vaani maanavkalyaan kii drushti se jis prakaar ke dharmik vichaaron evam anubhutiyon kaa prakaashan karti hai vaise vichaaron evam anubhatiyon ko puraani hindi main bahut pehle se sthaan milane laga tha
 In the ninth century of Vikrama, the works of Buddhist Siddhas presented the epithet of communal thoughts and practices related to Vajrayana and Sahajayana, as well as the repudiation of other sects
 uske ananthar nathpanthi yogiyon tathaa jain muniyon kii jo baniyaan milti hai, unamem bhi yahi bhaavana kaam karti dikhaai padati he
 The Buddhists did not have a place of God or God, the Nathpanthis revered divinity in their words
 in sabhi rachanaaon main niti ko pramukh sthaan praapt he
 They are seen preaching to people from place to place
 puraani hindi ke baad jab hindi kaa vikaas hua tab usapar bhi purvavarti sahitya kaa prabhaav anivaaryat: padaa
 That is why most of the compositions found in couplets in Hindi are preachy and ethical
 un dohon main katipay aise bhi he jinamein kavy kii aatma jhalkati si dikhaai pad jaati he
 But this cannot be called poetry
 pandrahavi shatee vikrami ke uttarardh se santaparampara kaa udbhav maananaa chahie
 Among the saints of these saints, the voice of ideology was predominant in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries of Ramanuja, Ninevark and Madhva Vikram, the principal Acharyas of Vaishnavism
 inke madhyam se bhakthi kii ek vegavati dhara kaa udbhav hua
 The commentaries presented by these Acharyas on the departed trait is their major contribution in the development of devotion
 gorakhnath se chamatkarapradhan yogamarg ke prachaar se bhakthi ke maarg main kuch baadha avashya upasthit hui thi, jisaki ore goswami tulsidas ne sanket bhi kiya he : However, it continued to develop
 usee ke parinamswaroop utkal main sant jayadev, maharashtra main warkari sampradaay ke prasiddh sant [[namdev tathaa gyanedav, pashchim main sant sadhana tathaa benny or kashmir main sant laldev kaa udbhav hua
 These saints were followed by the birth of the famous saint Ramanand, whose teachings had a wide impact on the masses
 yah itihassiddh satya he ki jab kisi viksit vichaardhaara kaa pravaah avaruddh karke ek duusari vichaardhaara kaa samarthan evam prachaar kiya jaataa he tab uske siddhanton ke yuktiyukt khandan ke saath uski katipay lokapriy evam lokopayogi visheshtaon ko athmiya bhi bana liya jaataa he
 Jagadguru Shankar, Raghavanand, Ramanuja, Ramanand etc
 have all had this vision
 srisampradaay par nathpanth kaa prabhaav pad chukaa tha, vah udaarataavaadi ho gaya tha
 Swami Ramanand's vision became even more liberal as a result of widespread public opinion
 isiilie unke pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh shishyon main julahe, raidas, nai, dom aadi sabhi kaa samavesh dekha jaataa he
 In this period, Satyabhiniveeshi devotees or sages also accepted the truth and attacked the untouchables
 pracheen kaal ke dharm kii jo pratik pradhan paddati chali aa rahi thi, saamaanya janata ko, uskaa bodh na hone ke kaaran, kabir jaise santon ke vyangyapradhan pratyakshparak vaagban aakarshak prathit hue
 Many of these saints understood the etishri of his sakatavya in extracting a new "creed" from his name
 unki samuhik maanavtaavaadi drushti sankeernata ke ghere main ja padi
 Thus from the sixteenth century to the nineteenth century the Nana Panth came into existence one after the other
 sikhon ke aadi yug nanakdev ne nanakpanth, dadu dayaal ne dadupanth, kabirdaas ne kabirpanth, baawari ne baawaripanth, haridas ne niranjani sampradaay or malukadas ne malukapanth ko janm diya
 Later, Baba Lalji sect, Dhani sect, Saath sect, Dharniswari sect, Dariyadasi sect, Dariyapat, Shivnarayani sect, Garibpant, Ramasnehi sect, etc
 are credited to the saints who took the fast of Satyadarshan and philanthropists
 And later embraced parochialism
 jo sant nirgun brahm kii upasna kaa upadesh dete hue ram, krishna aadi ko saadhaaran manushya ke rup main dekhne ke agrahi the ve swayan hi apane aapako ram, krishna kii bhanti pujane lage
 The sampradayas created many different types of fables to prove their Adi Guru to be God or divine
 yahi kaaran he ki un sabhi nirguniye santon ke vrutt apane panth yaa sampradaay kii pitari main hi band hokar rah gaye
 Here, ever since the research work has gained strength in literature, they are discussed in certain pages of literature, they have no contact with the general public
 in sampradaayon main do ek sampradaay aise bhi dekh pade, jinhone apane jivan main bhakthi ko gaun kintu karm ko pradhanta di
 The Satnami sects raised the flag of rebellion against the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb
 nanakpanth ke nawein guru shri govind singh ne apane sampradaay ko sena ke rup main parinam kar diya tha
 Later in this saint tradition, Radhaswami sect came into existence
 yah santaparampara raja rammohan raay, swami dayanand saraswati, swami ramtirth, tak chali ai he
 Mahatma Gandhi can be called the last link of this tradition
 jaisaa pehle kaha ja chukaa he, in sampradaayon or panthon ke bahusankhyak aadi guru ashikshit hi the
 Hence, they used to express their thoughts and feelings in verbal form
 shishymandal unhen yaad kar liya karata tha
 Later, the same preaching statements were transcribed by the disciples and became his scripture
 in kathanon evam vachanon ke sangrah main kahin kahin uttam or saamaanya kavy kii baangi bhi mil jaati he
 Therefore, there are certain saints among these poetical saints who, despite being mainly saints, are also poets, many of them have tried to overcome the lack of their classical education through polytheism, also in the field of philosophy, literature
 Not in the area
 inamen bahuton kaa sahitya ke swaroop se parichay tak nahin tha kintu unki anubhati kii tivrata kisi bhi bhavuk ke chitt ko prakrisht kar sati he
 Kabir is prominent among such saints
 hindu tathaa muslim donon kii dharmik paramparaon evam rudhigat katipay manyataon par, bina doordarshitapurvak vichaar ki, unhone jo vyangyatmak prahaar kiye or apane ko sabhi rishiyon muniyon se achaarvan evam sachharitra ghoshit kiya, uske prabhaav se samaaj kaa nimnavarg aprabhavit na rah sakaa evam aadhunik videshi sabhyataa main dikshit evam bhartiya sabhyataa tathaa samskruti se paranmukh katipay janon ko usamen sachhee maanavtaa kaa sandesh sunne ko mila
 Rabindranath Thakur presented an English translation of Kabir's Banias in harmony with Brahmasamaji ideas and was also influenced by his life
 kabir kii rachana mukhyat: saakhiyon or pardon main hui hai
 In this, his experiences have come in sharp form
 santaparampara main hindi ke pehle santasahityabhrashta jayadev hai
 These are different from Geetovindakar Jaidev
 sadhana, trilochan, namdev, sen bhai, raidas, peepa, dhanna, nanakdev, amardaas, dharmadas, dadudayaal, bashana ji, baawari sahiba, garibadas, sundardaas, dariyaadas, dariyaa sahab, sahjo bai aadi is parampara ke pramukh sant hai
 Santwani's specialty is that everywhere supports humanism
