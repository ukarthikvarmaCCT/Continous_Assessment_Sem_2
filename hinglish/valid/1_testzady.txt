 Avogadro's law is a law related to gas, named after Amadeo Avogadro
 ise "avogadro kii pariklpana" evam "avogadro kaa siddhanth" ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 In 1811, Avogadro presented this hypothesis, which is as follows - san 1811 i
 main italy ke rasayanajna aavogadro ne anu or parmaanu main bhed spasht karte hue bataaya ki parmaanu kisi tatv kaa vah sookshmatam kan he jo rasinic kriya main bhaag letaa he or iskaa swatantra astitv ho bhi saktaa he or nahin bhi
 a molecule is the smallest particle of matter that has all the properties of the substance and its independent existence is possible
 aavogadro ne hi sarvapratham kaha ki gaison main keval anuon kaa swatantra astitv sambhav he na ki parmaanuon kaa, isiilie gas ke aaytan ko usamen upasthit anuon se vyakt karnaa chahie
 On this basis Avogadro has expressed the following relationship: prarambh main is sambandh ko aavogadro kii pariklpana kaha gaya tha lekin baad main jab prayogon dwaara iskaa pareekshan kiya gaya to ise aavogadro kaa siddhant kaha jane laga
 And now it is called 'law of Avogadro'
 parmaanu siddhant ke sanshodhan main tathaa gelusa ke niyam kii vyakhya karne main is niyam kaa uyapyog hua he
 This rule is used in deriving atomicity of elemental gases, in determining the molecular weight, in relation to the mass volume of gases, and in the analysis of gases
 aavogadro kii sankhya-kisi bhi gas ke ek gram anu bhaar main anuon kii sankhya samaan hoti he
 This number is called Avogadro's number
 vibhinn vidhiyon se iskaa maan 6
02x1023 nishchit kiya gaya he
 Avogadro's number is one of the five world constants
 ise roman akshar en se nirupit karte hai
 The same volume of hydrogen and nitrogen will have the same number of molecules if they are kept at the same temperature and pressure and are behaving like ideal gas
 vyavhaar main vaastavik gaison ke liye yah niyam purnat: satya nahin he balki "lagbhag satya" he
 Where: avogadro ke niyam kaa sabase mahatvapurn nishkarsh yah he ki adarsh gas niyatank kaa maan sabhi gaison ke liye samaan hota he
 Ie kaa maan sabhi gaison ke liye samaan he, chaahe unke anon kaa aakaar athwa dravyaman kuch bhi ho
 here: kisi adarsh gas kaa ek mol maanak taap va daab par 22
4 litre sthaan gherta he
 This volume is often called the molar volume of an ideal gas

 kalawaad ko sahitya evam kala ke kshetra main upyogetavaad ke vilom ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 This theory was formulated by Victor Couze in 1818
 iske anusaar kala kaa uddeshy kisi naitik yaa dharmik uddeshy kii prapti nahin balki swany apane purnataa kii talash he
 Art is the carrier of aesthetics, so it should not be judged as a test of utility
 samaaj, niti, dharm, darshan aadi ke niyamon kaa paalan kala kii svachhand tathaa swatah sfoort abhivyakti main baadhak hote hai
 According to Artists, artists are extraterrestrial beings, art objects of art and artistic pleasure are supernatural tasteful and social
 iske vipareet upyogetavaadi kala ko na keval samaaj kii manovritiyaan parivartit karke vaanchit disha kii ore agresharit karne kaa shashakt saadhan maanate hai, apitu use siddhant prachaar kaa sarvottam madhyam bhi bataate hai
 Utilitarians have accused the artisans of being narrow and subjective, saying they are mounted on a pneumatic horse
 kalavaadiyon ne upyogetavaadiyon par sthool saamaajikta kaa agrahi hone kaa laanchhan lagaaya or kaha, unhone hamen swarg dene kaa vachan diya tha, lekin diya he ruganalay
 There is also a third class of thinkers who consider the coordination of the individualism of artism and the socialism of utilitarianism beneficial
 kalavaadi drushtikon kii pratyakshapratyaksh satta europe main plato tathaa arestu se lekar aaj tak kisi na kisi rup main lagaataar milti he
 Plato, in his treatise 'republic', has given a system of nationalizing poets and artists; Because, in his view, the immense influence of imaginative artists and poets was undesirable ethically and socially
 arestu ne yadhyapi apane guru plato kii naitik evam saamaajik dharna kaa khule rup main khandan nahin kiya he, saath hi kala main naitik tatv tathaa upadeshaatmakataa bhi unhen amaanya nahin kiya he, to bhi prasiddh kalasmeekshak bujar ke matanusaar arastu ne hi pehle pahal kalashaastra ne nitishastra ko pruthak kiya or bataaya ki parishkrut anandanubhuti hi kavyakala athwa kala kaa charam lakshya hota he
 The famous thinker of Rome, Cicer, has determined decency and sublime to be the chief productions of art
 longinus ne apni kriti 'periipsus' main kala ko na keval shiksha or manoranjan se bhinn evam shreshth mana he balki use samprerana ke ucch dharaatal par pratishthit karke, uske swatantra moolyankan kaa paraamarsh bhi diya he
 According to Longinus, the main elements of poetry and art are sublime and sublimation of emotion is their main result which is directly related to the person as well as the society
 at: apane vaktavy or pratipaadan main longinus nishchit hi madhyamargi hai
 Dionysis and Demetrius Prabhriti Many other Roman thinkers have laid special emphasis on the stylistic aspect of poetry and art
 europe kii shastreey yaa clasical kala kaa pallavan adhikanshat: isai dharm athwa 'carch' ke sarankshan main hua
 Therefore, between the seventh and the 15th century CE, the Roman art that developed from Egypt to Russia, with Rome as the center, was ethically-religious-values-coordinated as a church dependent, so it was necessary to be objective and didactic and that is why There was only secondary accessory in it
 to bhi aisa nahin he ki ukt kaal kii kala main kalpana tathaa bhaawanaaon ke liye koi chhot thi hi nahin
 In contrast, religiously artists used to create high quality art without any external control or compulsion
 talsty kalavaadi vichaardhaara ke prabal virdohi the
 Their lack of faith towards religion gives rise to artistic ideas and art is neither pleasurable nor beauty
 ve naitikta ke prati atyagrahi the or gandhi ji kii tarahat unka drushtikon sudhaarwadi tha
 Reformism is essentially utilitarianism
 at: talsty ke liye kala nishchit hi ek gaun saadhan maatr rahaa
 The great poet of Italy, Aligiari Dante, again reputed the sublime qualities and grand style in the field of art
 dante kaa prabhaav kuch hi din rahaa
 After this, the classical vision gradually came to be covered with romantic view
 falat: is samay kala sambandhi mulyon main baari parivartan hua
 The 17th century can be said to be quite important from the point of view of art
 iske dauraan france main navyashastravaad kaa udai hua
 But this too was no more than a newer version of medieval thought
 renesaan ke baad europe main madhyakaalin naitik mulyon kaa vighatan hona shuru hua jisase paramparawaadi tathaa swatantramulak vichaaron ke bich asthirataa kaa vaataavaran hi utpann nahin hua balki paraspar takaraav bhi hone laga
 The reason for this was the lack of a strong philosophy at this time
 san 1866 i
 ke lagbhag vividh saahitiyik evam kalasambandhi vaadon ke pravartan main agrahi desh france main 'l aart por l aart' sutarakathan saamne aayaa jiskaa angreji anuwaad 'art for arts sek' he or hindi main jise 'kala kala ke liye' vaakyansh se janaa jaataa he
 It is from here that the artistic ideology can be seen as a direct beginning
 amareeki chitrakaar james abot mecnil hvisler, jo aaajeevan france or england main karyrat rahaa, kalawaad kaa prabal samarthak bana
 It was that Ruskin, a noted English critic at the Grosswainer painting exhibition in 1877 AD, sharply criticized the Whistler's paintings, saying that the Whistler poured colorful cups on the faces of the audience through his paintings
 raskni ke is kathan par adaalat main mukadmaa shuru ho gaya jisamen hvisler ko antat: kshatipurti ke rup main ek fading mila
 Even then, there was debate between Ruskin and Hwisler about the purpose of art
 ruskin kala ko naitikta se alag-thalag bilkul swantatra evam swat:purna maanata tha
 Inspired by this, Hwisler, with all his power, enforced the 'kala Kala K' vote which reached the limits of extremism
 breadle, clive bel, roger faai tathaa george inness ityadi pramukh samalochak kalavaadi vichaardhaara ke prabal poshak the
 Bradley explicitly declared in his treatise 'poetry for Poetry's Sec' that morality is the only external aspect of poetry
 at: kavita kii shreshthata ke liye use anivaary maananaa ekadam besujh hai
 Clive Bell considered the motif in the context of modern painting and in 1914 introduced the theory of 'significant Farm' which was revised by Roger Fi in 1920
 kroche ke abhivyanjanawad se kalawaad ko ek suspasht darshanik aadhaar praapt ho gaya
 On the basis of Kant's founding 'beauty has no external existence', Croche in his treatise called 'la Spirito' has given the power of 'inner wisdom' for aesthetics and states that both aesthetics and beauty are subtle mental pursuits
 
 saath hi varnyavastu tathaa abhivyanjana ke bich tathvik ekta hoti he
 Therefore, it is misleading to look at artisanal and objective aspects
 kroche ke anusaar kala mulat: ek aadhyatmik kriya he, isliye uski drushti main abhivyanjana ke atirikt kala ko koi anya uddeshy athwa prayojan nahin hota
 Not only this, Croche also considered art to be free from moral and academic limitations
 dekha jaae to kroche ke siddhant dwaara ek prakaar se upyogetavaadi manyata kaa khandan ho jaataa he, lekin ukt siddhant kala ke amoort vyapaar par hi lagu hota he, moort par nahin
 Kroche's art theory is not essentially anti-social because even if it is tangible, he does not consider art as social
 friid ke 'swapnavaad' se bhi kalavaadi drushti ko kaaphi bal mila
 In his book 'principles of Literary Criticism', IA Richard's, while denouncing the artistic vision on theoretical grounds, gave great importance to the remittance in poetry process and said that the power of poetry is not different from the rest of the world nor does the feeling of poetry The rest is different from the experience of the world
 is prakaar richards ne kala ke kshetra main upyogetavaad ko pun: pratishtha kii
 The rise of Marxism led to a rapid disintegration of artistic beliefs
 marks ne apane arthshaastra main kala ke prati upyogetavaadi drushtikon apanaaya or kaha ki kala janata ke liye, mukhyat: sainikon or shramikon ke liye hi he
 Stalin considered art and literature in Russia and Mao in China as the main means of propagating politics, and placed a curse on him with power
 maao ne 'prablems ov art and litarechar' sheershak apane paripatr main marks kii uparyukt sthapanaaon ke prati aasthaa vyakt kii he
 Marxist critic Codwell has also termed the artistic ideology as the result of a sickening attitude created by a purely bourgeois view
 marxvaadi kheme main tratski hi ek aisa vyakti he ja kala ke kshetra main raajnneetik party ke hastekshap ko anuchit maanata he
 In his treatise titled 'literature and Revolution', he has clearly stated, there is no need to order the party in the field of art
 yah thik he ki party ke kartavyon main kala kii raksha or uski sahaayta karnaa bhi he, lekin nettrutv us kshetra main aparoksh rup se hi ho saktaa he
 IP here With the study of physiology and psychology presented by scholars like Pavlov, it has finally been decided that art is as useful for the individual and society as other general physical material
 bhartiya sahitya main bhi alankaar, reeti, vakrokti aadi se sambandhit anek aise sampradaay rahe hai jinaki drushti main kalapaksh adhik mahatvapurn tha

 Ludwig Wittgenstein was the philosopher of Austria
 unhone tarkshastra, ganit kaa darshan, man kaa darshan, evam bhashaa ke darshan par mukhyatah kaary kiya
 He is counted among the greatest philosophers of the twentieth century
 unke jite ji ek hi pustak prakashit ho pai - Tractatus logico-philosophicus
 Philosophical Investigations became quite popular in later published books
 vitgenshtin cambridge vishvavidhyalay ke professor rahe hai
 Wittgenstein's father Karl was a Jew who later adopted the Protestant religion
 vitganstin kaa sabase bada yogadan bhashaa ko darshanik paripekshya main rakhane kaa he
 When anyone mentions philosophy in linguistics today, Wittgenstein's name is automatically remembered
 vitganstin ke lekhan se kaaphi tark-vitark upja he, yahan tak ki kai baar vitganstin ke kaam ko darshanavipareet bhi kaha gaya he, kintu aisa kahana isaliye galat hoga ki vitganstin se pehle bhi tarkshastriyon ne bhashaa ke taarkik vishleshan par jor daalaa tha
 Wittgenstein's Guru Bertrand is contributing heavily to give logic a proper place in philosophy
 vitganstin kaa darshanik jivan kaaphi dilachasp he kyonki unhone apane baad ke kaaryon main apane puraane kaaryon kaa khandan kiya he
 In his earlier books, Wittgenstein appears to state the importance of language for truth, but in his last book, "philosophical Investigations", Wittgenstein describes the prevalence of language in bias
 vitganstin kaa ye nishkarsh darshanik jagat ke liye nutan or mahatvapurn siddh hua
 In a way, Wittgenstein conceived the idea that language does not describe truth but construct truth
 samast paashchaatya darshan bhashaa main hi nihit he, kintu bhashaa hamen satya kaa ek rup hi pradarshit karti he, vah satya jo ham apni manyata yaa anubhav se nirmit karte hai
 Wittgenstein repeatedly mentions a language play, in which participants create and use language to express the truth
 is krida ke madhyam se vitgenstin bhashaa se vivirat tathyon va satya main antar bataate hai
 In his negative book "philosophical Investigations" he states that "most of the times when we talk about the" meaning "of a word, we only talk about the use of that word in one language"

 Under sociolinguistics, the impact of society on language and language on society is studied
 yah bhashavaigyanik adhyayan kaa vah kshetra he jo bhashaa or samaaj ke bich paye janevaale har prakaar ke sambandhon kaa adhyayan vishleshan karata he
 That is, Sociolinguistics is that which studies all aspects and contexts of the structure and use of language which are related to social and cultural functions, hence the linguistic identity of different social classes within its field of study, social attitude towards language and All references to language studies like aptitude, social styles of language, social basis of multilingualism, language planning etc
 They come, who are related to social institution
 samajabhashavigyaan main saamaajik pratik, sampreshan, shabdic ghatana, sampoornabhasha, vaartalap tathaa bhoomika aadhaarit hoti he
 The name 'lebav' is the most prominent among those who pursue the philosophy of Sociolinguistics
 yah varg maanata he ki bhashaa or samaaj ke sambandho ko bhashavigyaan ke apane sandarbh se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Language itself is a social object, so social elements are intrinsic in its basic nature
 ye hi tatv bhashaa ko vishamarupi or vikalpanyukt banaate hai
 The study of these alternatives in language practice reveals the true nature of language
 lebaav kaa yah kathan he ki samajabhashavigyaan aisi koi alag vidha nahin maani ja sakati, kyonki samajabhashavigyaan hi to vaastavik bhashavigyaan he
 The social linguistics that is discussed today is neither the result of mere mixing of sociology and linguistics nor is it a co-concept of social system and linguistic system, assuming that language is a relative symbolism of society
 And at the core of this symbol, social elements are contained, we ask for any one person - aap idhar aaie
 So speak to another person - tu idhar aa
 When we say to a respected doctor or professor - kripaya bataaie ki xxrep 4 
 While speaking to a washerman or cobbler - tu yah bataa ki


 Similarly, using the plural from your parents or grandfather maternal grandfather speaks- aap yahan baithen
 While using the singular when talking to younger sons and daughters or grandchildren, say- tu yahan baith, yaa phir tum yahan baitho
 The determinant behind the use of one of you, you, or one of them or the selection of another in singular or plural is the social perception of language use
 samajabhashavigyaan kii yah manyata he ki bhashaa ko is saamaajik bodh athwa uske saamaajik prayojan se alag kar dekhnaa asangat he
 Therefore, he does not consider language as a system of pure linguistic symbols, as a class of theoretical linguists accept
 vah ek varg sweekaar karata he
 He defines language as a subsystem of social symbols
 is prakaar ham dekhte he ki samajabhasha main samaaj dwaara jahaan nirvaadh gati se bolta he vah kabhi bhashaa kaa dhyaan na dekar vah sampreshan par vishesh dhyaan dete hue mukh sukh kaa suvidha dena chahta he
 In linguistics, it is called sociolinguistics
 ek tazaa bhashaai anumaan ke mutabiq duniya main ek vaqt kul chah hazaar aath sau nau bhashaayen boli jaati thim lekin unki sankhya tezi se kam ho rahi he
 Because 90 percent of the languages are such that the number of speakers is less than one lakh
 537 bhashaayen aisi bhi hai jinke bolne vaale pachaas se bhi kam rah gaye hai lekin zyaada afsosna haalat un 46 bhashaaon kii he jo aane vaale chand saalon main khatm hone vaali hai kyonki unke baalane vaala sirf ek-ek hi insaan baaqi rah gaya he
 The Mandarin language spoken in China is considered to be the largest language in the world in terms of population while the English language is second
 hindi or urdu ko agar ek bhashaa mana jaae to aabaadi ke lihaaz se wo vishwa kii teesri badi bhashaa he lekin agar hindi ko alag bhashaa ke taur par dekha jaae to duniya bhar kii zabaanon kii suchi main uskaa number chatha banataa he
 Bangla is at number five and Urdu goes to number 22
 iske alaava arabi or hasapanvi bhi duniya kii badi bhashaaon main shaamil he lekin angrezi kaa maamla sabase alag he
 As the mother tongue of only 32 million people in the world is English, which is in abundance in USA, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand
 lekin duniya bhar ke deshon main anya 35 karod log aise hai jo angrezi ko ek sampark bhashaa ke taur par istemaal karte hai yani apni matra bhashaa ke saath-saath ve angrezi bhi usee suvidha or raftaar se bol lete hai
 Apart from them, there are ten to fifteen crore people who have learned English for their needs but now the number of people who are neither mother language nor contact language is increasing rapidly
 However, education, employment or only intellectual He has mastered English for the purpose of expanding knowledge
 radio, tivi, film or khaastaur par internet kaa istemaal badhane ke saath-saath angrezi kaa istemaal bhi badhata ja rahaa he
 To fully understand the nature of English as a language, it is important to know some basic principles of linguistics
 masalan hamen maaloom hona chahie ki duniya bhar kii bhashaayen kin samoohon main banti hai or kisi bhi bhashaa ke samajhane ke liye uski utpatti jaananaa zaruri he
