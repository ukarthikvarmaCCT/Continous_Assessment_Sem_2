 The English language is written in Roman script
 yah ek pashchim jarmenic bhashaa he jisaki utpatti anglo-sexn england main hui thi
 As a result of the military, scientific, political, economic, and cultural influences of the United States in the first half of the 19th century and the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries of the British Empire, it has become a common language in many parts of the world
 kai antarrashtriya sanghathanon or rashtramandal deshon main bade paimaane par iskaa istemaal ek dwitiya bhashaa or adhikarik bhashaa ke rup main hota he
 Historically, the English language has its origins in several dialects, now called Old English, introduced by the anglo-saxon people who settled in England since the early 5th century
 viking hamalaavaron kii pracheen norse bhashaa kaa angreji bhashaa par gaharaa prabhaav padaa he
 After the Norman Conquest, Old English developed into Middle English, for which Norman vocabulary and spelling rules were heavily used
 vahaan se aadhunik angreji kaa vikaas hua or abhi bhi isamen anek bhashaaon se videshi shabdon ko apnaane or saath hi saath nae shabdon ko gadhane kii prakriya nirantar jari he
 The formation of a large number of English words, especially technical words, is based on the roots of ancient Greek and Latin
 aadhunik angreji, jisko kabhi - kabhi pratham vaishvik saamaanya bhashaa ke taur par bhi varnit kiya jaataa he,sanchaar, vigyaan, vyapaar, vimaanan, manoranjan, radio or kootneeti ke kshetron kii pramukh antarrashtriya bhashaa he
 Its expansion beyond the British Isles began with the development of the British Empire and by the end of the 19th century its reach had become truly global
 yah sanyukt rajya america kii pramukh bhashaa he
 Since the Second World War, the recognition of America as a global superpower and its increasing economic and cultural influence has brought significant momentum in the spread of the English language

 According to linguists such as David Crystal, an effect of the widespread spread of English, as has happened with other global languages, appears to reduce the diversity of vernacular languages in many parts of the world, particularly The effect is seen in Australasia and North America, and its enormous impact continues to play an important role in language attrition

 These dialects were brought to Britain in the 5th century by German nomads and Roman auxiliary armies from various parts of present-day northwestern Germany and northern Netherlands

 Bead has written that his entire country, except his old land, had come to Britain

 Initially Old English was a group of diverse dialects that reflected the diversity of the anglo-saxon states of Great Britain

 doosraa 11 veen sadi ke normans the, jo kii puraani norman bhashaa bolte the or isaki anglo-norman namak ek angreji kism kaa vikaas kiya
 The English became somewhat "mixed" due to these two attacks

 This Norman influence entered English mainly through the courts and the government
 is prakaar, angreji ek "udhaar" kii bhashaa ke rup main viksit hui jisamen lacheelaapan or ek vishaal shabdaawalee thi
 The rise and expansion of the British Empire as well as the emergence of the United States as a great power resulted in the spread of English throughout the world

 Attacks of Vikings and Norse tribes from the north also began in the eighth and ninth centuries, and thus the region of present-day England became a country of many language speakers and many old words found new meanings
 jaise – dream kaa arth us samay tak anand lenaa tha lekin uttar ke vikings ne ise sapane kaa arth de diya
 Similarly, the word skirt also came here with the northern attackers
 lekin iskaa rup badal kar shart ho gaya
 Later both the words started to be used in different meanings and are happening till date

 Since Scots linguists see either a separate language or a group of dialects of English, Frisian is often said to be the closest relative of English than Scots

 scots or sambhawatah frisian ke apwaad ke sivaa inamen se kisi bhi bhashaa kaa angreji ke saath parsparik mail nahin baithta he
 The reason for this is the difference in word storage, syntax, semantics and phonetic knowledge
 anya jarmenic bhashaaon ke saath angreji ke shabd bhandaran main antar kaa mukhya kaaran angreji main badi maatra main latin shabdon kaa upyog he or french ) german or angreji kaa vaakyavinyas bhi angreji se kaaphi alag he, vaakyon ko banane ke liye alag niyam hai

 Differences in phonics also blur basically related words, and sometimes both phonetics and semantics are different
 1500 sau se zyada varshon se angreji main yogic shabdon ke nirmaan or maujuuda shabdon main sudhaar kii kriya apane alag andaaj main, germanik bhashaaon se pruthak, chal rahi he
 For example, abstract nouns can be formed by adding suffixes like -hood, -ship, -dom, -ness to native words in English
 lagbhag sabhi jarmenic bhashaaon main in sabhi ke sajaateey pratyay maujuud hai lekin unke upyog bhinn ho gaye hai, jaise kii german "free-hit" banaam angreji "free-dam" An English speaker can also read many French words easily because there is a large amount of adjustment of French and Norman words in English
 yah samaayojan norman vijay ke baad anglo-norman bhashaa se or baad kii sadiyon main sidhe french bhashaa se shabdon ko uthaane ke kaaran he
 As a result, a large part of the English vocabulary comes from the French language, with some minor spelling differences and differences in the meanings of so-called false friends
 The English pronunciation of most French single words is fully Englishized and follows a specific English method of emphasis

 The former is sometimes called BBC English, a clan noted for its inclination towards "received pronunciation"; It follows the Cambridge model

 Apart from these two major dialects, there are several varieties of English, most of which include several sub-types, such as Cockney, Scouse and Geordie under British English; Newfoundland English under Canadian English; And African American Local English and South American English under American English
 English is a multi-centric language and does not have a central language authority like the 'acedimia francai' of France; Therefore, no one type is considered "right" or "wrong"

 paaramparik prakaaron ke uccharan, vyakaran or shabd bhandar angreji kii anya kismon se bhinn, kabhi kabhaar baari maatra main, hai
 Due to the widespread use of English as a second language, there are different types of accents of its speakers, which reveal the local dialect or language of the speaker
 kshetreey lahazon kii adhik vishisht visheshtaon ke liye 'angreji ke kshetreey lahazon' ko dekhen or kshetreey boliyon kii adhik vishisht visheshtaon ke liye angreji bhashaa kii boliyon kii soochi ko dekhen

 udahaaran ke taur par, aashcharya athwa vyangy vyakt karnaa, yaa ek vaktavy ko prashn main badalanaa
 In English, intonation patterns occur on a group of words known as tone groups, tone units, intonation groups, or sense groups
 tone samoohon ko ek hi saans main kaha jaataa he, is kaaran se inaki lambaai simit rahati he
 These are on average five words long and are finished in about two seconds
 udhaaharan ke liye : English is a very spoken language
 shabdon or vaakyon, donon ke kuch shabdaanshon ko uccharan ke samay apekshaakrit adhik mahatva / jor miltaa he jabaki anya ko nahin
 pehle prakaar ke shabdaanshon ko axcentuated / stressd kaha jaataa he or baad waalon ko anexentuated / anstroped 
 Thus each tone group in a sentence can be divided into syllables which will be either stressed or unstressed
 The stressed syllable is called the nuclear syllable
 udhaaharan ke liye: Was the best thing you could have done! ' yahaan saare shabdaansh anstroped hai, sivaay best or dan ke, jo kii stressd hai
 The emphasis on BEST is slightly higher, hence the nuclear syllable
 newclear shabdaansh vaktaa ke mukhya bindu kaa varnan karata he
 for example: yah bhi It can also be used to express emotion: newclear shabdaanshon ko zyada unche swar main bolaa jaataa he or inako bolne ke lahaze main ek vishisht badlaav hota he
 The most common variations of this tone are the raising of the voice and lowering of the voice, although the falling voice and the falling sound are also used occasionally
 anya bhashaaon kii apeksha angreji bhashaa main aawaaj ko unchaa or nicha karne kaa mahatva kahin adhik he
 Speaking in a low voice indicates certainty and speaking in a loud voice indicates uncertainty
 This can have a significant impact on meaning, especially in showing positive or negative attitudes; Speaking in a low voice means your "point of view" and a rising voice means "point of view"
 haan / nahin vaale prashnon kii chadhati hui aawaaj ke peeche bhi yahi he
 for example: swar prayek kshetra main bhinn bhinn hote hai
 Where symbols are visual in pairs, the first corresponds to the common American pronunciation of American English, the second corresponds to the received pronunciation of British English

, many animal names and many common Activities jarmenic shabd angreji ke latin shabdon se zyada chote hote hai or saamaanya bolchaal main inkaa upyog zyada aam he
 It includes almost all the basic pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, denotative verbs etc
 that make up the basic syntax and grammar of English
 lambe latin shabdon ko aksar zyada alankrita or shikshit mana jaataa he
 However, excessive use of Latin words is considered to be an attempt to show off or hide the issue

 This essay is considered an important review of the English language

 kuch maamalon main, ek jarmenic vyutpann shabd, ek latin vyutpann shabd or samaan latin shabd se vyutpann ek french shabd main se chayan karne kaa vikalp rahata he
 These synonyms, incorporating diverse meanings and nuances, help the speakers to express nuances and differences of views

 Most Latin words are commonly used in formal speech or writing, such as a court or an encyclopedic article
 However, there are other Latin words that are commonly used in general colloquial and do not appear to be too formal; These words are primarily for concepts that no Germanic word has survived

 The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition contains more than 6 million definitions, following the overall policy: It embraces not only the standard language of literature and conversation, whether current at the moment, or obsolete, or archaic, but also the main technical vocabulary, and a large measure of dialectal usage and slang 
 The editors of Webster's third new international dictionary, without layoffs, estimate this number to be much higher in his preface
 aisa anumaan he kii lagbhag 25,000 shabd har saal bhashaa main judate hai
 One consequence of the French influence is that the English vocabulary has been somewhat divided into Germanic and Latin words
 angreji ke 1000 sabase aam shabdon main se 83% or 100 sabase aam main se puure 100 jarmenic hai
 Conversely, most of the more advanced words in subjects like science, philosophy, mathematics come from Latin or Greek

 The spelling system, or orthography, is multi-layered
 isamen sthaneey jarmenic pranali ke upar french, greek or latin vartanee ke tatv shaamil hai; bhashaa ke dhwani vigyaan se yah kaaphi hat gaya he
 There is often a considerable difference in the pronunciation and spelling of words

 Some phonetic spelling advocates claim that English is more than 80% phonetic

 The result of this complex orthographic history is that reading can be a challenging task
 greek, french or spanish or kai anya bhashaaon kii tulana main, ek chaatr ko angreji pathan kaa paarangat banane main zyada vakt lagata he
 Only consonant letters are pronounced in a relatively regular way: adhikansh jarmenic bhashaaon ke vipareet, angreji main dyacritics, sivaay videshi udharshabdon ke, lagbhag nahin ke baraabar hai or do swaron ke uccharan ko ek dhwani kii bajaay pruthak darshane ke liye diarisis nishaan ke asaamaanya upyog main

 Its written type remains the same almost everywhere, in contrast to which the English language differs according to dialects, accents, types of slang, local and regional expressions
 bhashaa ke aupchaarik likhit sanskaran main sthaneey bhinnataayen kaaphi simit hai
 The scope of this variation is limited to the spelling differences of British and American English
 angreji pathan ko asana karne ke liye iske kuch sarlikrut sanskaran bhi maujuud hai
 One of these is Basic English, formed by Charles K
 Ogden with limited words and describes it in his book Basic English: a General Introduction with Rules and Grammar
 yah bhashaa angreji ke ek sarlikrut sanskaran par aadhaarit he
 Ogden said that it would take seven years to learn English, seven months for Esperanto and only seven days for basic English
 Companies that require complex books for international use, as well as schools that teach people basic English in a short period of time, can use Basic English
 ogden ne basic english main aisa koi shabd nahin daalaa jise kuch anya shabdon ke saath bolaa ja sake or anya bhashaaon ke vaktaaon ke liye bhi ye shabd kaam karen, is baat kaa bhi usne khyaal rakhaa

 For example, the word close may be used in the phrase "close the door" but "do not go close to the landing gear"
 angrezon ne duniya ke anek deshon ko raajnneetik rup se apana upnivesh banaaya
 Along with this, they also imposed English cleverly on those countries

 british counsil jaisi santhaayen is angrezi ke prasar ke liye tarah-tarah ke dushprachaar evam gupt abhiyaan karti rahati hai
 But as a mother tongue, Hindi and Chinese language has surpassed English
 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200~350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 After that, there was a continuous war for twelve days among the Devas and Demons to take control of the Amrit Kalash

 The Gregorian calendar {gregorian calendar} is a calendar used almost everywhere in the world
 yah julian kaaldarshak kaa roopaantaran he
 It was implemented by Pope Gregory
 isse pehle julian kaaldarshak prachlan main tha, lekin usamen anek trutiyaan thim, jinhen gregory kaaldarshak main dur kar diya gaya
 The main unit of Gregorian calendar is day
 365 dinon kaa ek varsh hota he, kintu har chauthaa varsh 366 din kaa hota he jise adhivarsh kehete hai
 The Sun-based almanac is repeated every 146,097 days
 ise 400 varshon main baanta gaya he or yah 20871 saptaah ke baraabar hota he
 In these 400 years, 303 years are common years, consisting of 365 days
 or 97 lip varsh hote hai, jiname 366 din hote hai
 Thus every year has 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes and 12 seconds
 julian calendar main 365 din 6 ghante kaa varsh mana jaataa tha, parantu aisa maanane se prayek varsh kranti-paatik saura varsh se 11 minute 14 second adhik lete hai
 This excess exceeds 3 days in 400 years
 is bhul par sarvapratham rome ke pope gregory ne sookshmtapurvak vichaar kiya
 He calculated in 1582 AD that at the time of the Dharma Sammelan of Nice city, which took place in the year 325 AD, the aforesaid excess has become 10 days, due to which the date was going back 10 days due to not being taken into account
 
 is vichaar se unhone nepulas ke jyotishi elaay sius liliyas ke paraamarsh se 1582 isvi main 5 oktober ko 15 veen oktober nishchit kiya or tab se yah niyam nikaala ki jo shatabdi varsh 4 se puri tarah vibhajit hone kii bajaay yadi 400 se puri tarah vibhajit ho tabhi use adhivarsh mana jaae anyathaa nahin
 Since this new method was started by Pope Gregory, it was called the Gregorian method or the new method
 is paddati ko bhinn-bhinn isai deshon main bhinn-bhinn varshon main sweekaar kiya gaya
 From this it is necessary to keep this in mind while reading the history of these countries
 is naveen paddati ko italy, france, spain or portugal ne 1582 i0 main, prashia, germany ke roman catholic pradesh switzraland, holland or flanders ne 1583 i0 main, poland ne 1586 i0 main, hungary ne 1587 i0 main, germany or netherland ke protestant pradesh tathaa denmark ne 1700 i0 main, british samrajya ne 1752 i0 main, japan ne 1972 i0 main china ne 1912 i0 main, bulgaria ne 1915 i0 main, turki or soviet rus ne 1917 i0 main tathaa yugoslavia or romania ne 1919 i0 main apanaaya
 After 1582 AD, in 1700 AD till 28 February, the date of the new calendar increased from the old calendar by 10 days
 1600 i0 shatabdi varsh hone se chunki 400 se puri tarah vibhajit hota tha atah vah nayi paddati se bhi adhivarsh hi hota
 Therefore, it did not increase by 1 day to differentiate the date
 taatpary yah ki puraane calendar se naye calendar main taarikh badalte hue unheen shatabdi varshon main purvokt 10 din se ek-ek din kramshah badhaayaa jayega jin shatabdi varshon main 400 se puri tarah bhaag nahin lagata
 That is, after 28 February of 1700 AD, 11 days will be added instead of 10 days to make the date of the new calendar
 isi prakaar 1800 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 12 din or 1900 i0 kii 28 farvari ke baad 13 din jode jaayenge
 Again, this increase will be only 13 days due to being completely divided from 400 to 2000 AD, it will not increase by an additional 1 day

 Simurga or Anqa was the name of a giant flying female creature in Iran's ancient mythology known for its kindness, generosity and wisdom
 iske pankhons se har rog or chot thik ho jaati thi or iske prabhaav se bhoomi, jal, akaash or praani-jagat main shaanti failati thi
 This bird was considered by the Turkish people of Central Asia and also in some parts of India
 simurg ko 'simurv', 'semurg', 'samarook' or 'samran' jaise naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Note the pronunciation of the letter 'G' in 'simurgh' as it is slightly different from 'c' without any point

 iske naam ko lekar aadhunik-farsi jaanane waalon main yah galat bhram bhi paidaa ho jaataa he ki iskaa 'tees' kii sankhya se kuch sambandh he, haalanki mul naam kaa aisa koi arth nahin tha
 In modern Persian language 'C' means 'thirty'
 is se yah dharna bhi paidaa ho gai he ki iske tees rang the yaa iskaa akar tees pakshiyon ke baraabar tha
 In ancient mythology, Simurg was said to purify the land and the sky and make it fertile

 The series was published by DC Comics during 1986 and 1987 and was later republished in a compiled graphic novel
 wachamen kii utpatti moore dwaara DC ko saunpi ek prastaavit kahani se hui, jisamen super hero paatr the, jise company ne charlton comics se hasil kiya
 Since Moore's proposed story would make many characters unusable for future stories, managing editor Dick Giordano persuaded the author to create original characters instead
 moore ne kahani kaa upyog samakaleen chintaaon ko pratibimbit karne or superhiro avadharana kii vivechna ke saadhan ke rup main kiya
 Watchmen take place on an alternate history Earth, where superheroes emerge in the 1940s and 1960s to help America win the Vietnam War

 The story focuses on the personal development and conflict of the main characters, when the investigation into the murder of a government-sponsored superhero drags them out of retirement and eventually confronts them with an intrigue, where they have to avert a nuclear war that would leave millions May be the cause of death
 rachanaatmak rup se, wachamen kaa centre bindu uski sanrachana he
 Gibbons used a nine-panel grid layout throughout the series and added recurring symbols, such as a blood-stained smiley
 Only the last issue shows complementary fictional documents, which combine the series' back story and the episode is intertwined with another comic tale of a fictional pirate named Tales of the Black Freighter, which a character reads
 is graphic upanyaas main kaal, samay or kathanak badalte rahete hai, jo ise ek vaastavik tedha-medhaa vrittant sabit karata he
 Watchmen has received critical acclaim in both comics and mainstream newspapers, and critics consider it a seminal work of the graphic novel medium

 "I suppose i was just thinking, 'that'd be a good way to start a comic book: have a famous super-hero found dead
' As the mystery unraveled, we would be led deeper and deeper into the real heart of this super-hero's world, and show a reality that was very different to the general public image of the super-hero
 " 1985 main, DC comics ne charlton comics se paatro kii ek shrenee kaa adhigrahan kiya
 During that period, writer Alan Moore thought of writing a story presenting out-of-the-box superheroes, as he did in his Miracleman series in the 1980s
 moore kaa tark tha ki MLJ comics ke mity crusyder aisi pariyojna ke liye uplabdh ho sakate hai, isliye unhone ek rahasyatmak hatya ke kathanak ke bare main sochaa, jo ek bandargah par da shield kii laash milane ke saath shuru hota he
 The author felt that the group of characters they eventually used did not matter, as long as readers recognized them "so it would be shocking and surprising when you look at the reality of these characters
" Moore used this premise and created a proposal titled Who Killed the Peacemakers, introducing Charlton characters and unsolicited proposals to DC managing editor Dick Giordano
 Giordano accepted the proposal, but the editor opposed the idea of using Charlton characters for the story
 moore ne kaha, "DC ko ehsaas hua ki unke mahange paatr yaa to ant main mar jaaenge yaa bekaar ho jaaenge
" iske bajaay, jiordno ne moore ko mul paatro ko pesh karne ke liye unhen apane prastutikaran par dubaara kaary karne ke liye manaaya
 shuruuaat main moore kaa vishwaas tha ki moulik paatr pathakon ke liye bhavuk goonj pradaan nahin kar paaenge, lekin baad main unka man badal gaya
 He said, "ultimately, i realized that if i write alternative characters just a little bit, so that they sound familiar in some ways, some of their specific aspects bring back the echo of a normal superhero or make the reader feel familiar, So it can be successful
 " Illustrator Dave Gibbons, who had been with Moore in previous projects, found out that the writer was working on a limited series
 chitrakaar ne kaha ki ve bhi isamen shaamil hona chaahate hai, to moore ne unhen kahani kii ruparekha bheji
 gibans ne jiordno se kaha ki ve is shrinkhalaa ko chitrit karnaa chaahate hai, jise moore ne prastaavit kiya he or moore ne manzuri de di
 gibans ne pariyojna main rangakaar jon higgins ko shaamil kiya, kyonki unki 'asaamaanya' style unhen pasand thi; higgins chitrakaar ke nazadik hi rahete the, jisase donon ko "bas sagar ke paar bhejne ke bajaay, aapas main kuch maanviya sampark or charchaa karne main suvidha hui"
 is pariyojna ke sampadak ke rup main len wain isamen shaamil ho gaye, jabaki jiordno isaki nigaraanee par rahe
 wain or jiordno, donon peeche hat gaye or "unke raste se baahar nikal gaye", jiordno ne baad main kaha, "kiske bas kii baat ki alan moore ko sampadit kare?" After approval to further work on the project, Moore and Gibbons spent a day at Gibbons' home to discuss the creation of the characters, the decor and effects of the story's surroundings
 The pair were particularly influenced by Superman's absurd parody of a "superduperman"; Moore said, "we wanted to take Superduperman 180 degrees - dramatic rather than comedy
" Moore and Gibbons envisioned a story that would "take the familiar superhero of old fashion into a completely new realm"; The author stated that he intended "to create a superhero Moby Dick; something that has the same weight, same density
 The author fixed the names and descriptions of the characters, but left their extraneous features to Gibbons
 Gibbons
 Did not design those characters after deliberation, but "at random times 


 probably spent two or three weeks just sketching
" yadi aap ek topi bana sakate hai, to aapane rorak ko bana liya, aap sirf uske chehre ke liye ek aakaar banaate hai or us par kuch kaale chhinte daal dete hai or aapkaa kaam ho gaya
 " moore ne kaaphi pehle shrinkhalaa likhni shuru kii, taaki prakaashan main vilamb se bachaa ja sake, jaisaa ki DC simit shrinkhalaa 3000 kemlot ke maamle main hua tha
 While writing the screenplay for the first issue, Moore stated that he felt "I had enough screenplay for only six digits
 ham 12 ke liye anubandhit the!" unka samaadhaan tha un ankon main pher-badal karnaa, jo sampoorn shrinkhalaa ke kathanak se sambandhit paatro kii utpatti se jude the
 Moore wrote a fairly detailed screenplay for Gibbons' work
 Gibbons recalls that "for the first issue of Watchmen, he sent a scripted, i think, 101 pages of single space where there was no gaps between each panel description or, virtually, even between pages
" " patakatha praapt karne par, kalakaar ko prayek prishth ko kramvaar sankhyabaddh karnaa padaa,"kyonki maan lijiye yadi main unhen farsh par gira detaa hum, to unhen waapas sahi kram main rakhane main mujhe do din lag jaaenge" or aksharon or shot vivaranon ko spasht karne ke liye ek hiliter kalam kaa istemaal kiya; unhone kaha,"isse pehle ki aap vastav main kagaz par kalam chalaaen, isamen aapako kaaphi prabandhan kii jarurat hoti he" moore kii vistrut patakatha ke baavjood, unke panel vivaran aksar is note ke saath samaapt hote, "yadi yah aapke kaam nahin aae, to jaisaa thik samajhen vaisaa kijiye"; phir bhi gibans ne moore ke nirdeshon par kaam kiya
 Gibbons had a lot of freedom to develop Watchmen scenes and often added background details, which Moore accepted much later
 Moore occasionally contacted fellow comics writer Neil Guyman for answers and quotes for research questions to include in the issue
 apane iraadon ke baavjood, moore ne navambar 1986 main sweekaar kiya ki deree kii sambhaavnaaen hai or kaha ki jab ank # 5 jari ho chukaa tha, tab bhi ve ank nau likhane main vyast the
 Gibbons said that a major factor in the delay was Moore's screenplay meeting "in installments"
 gibans ne kaha ki team kii gati chauthe ank ke aas-paas dhimi ho gai; us samay ke baad se donon ne apana kaam shuru kiya "bas ek baar main kai prishth
 mujhe alan se patakatha ke teen prishth praapt hote or main unhen bana letaa or phir ant main use phone karata or kahata 'fid me! or vah phir se do yaa teen prishth bhej detaa yaa shaayad ek yaa kabhi-kabhi chah prishth bhi
 jaise-jaise rachanaakaar samay-seemaa puri karte gaye, moore ek taxi driver bhaade par lete or 50 mile kii duuri tay karte hue gibans ko patakatha saunpte
 baad main ankon par kalakaar ne samay bachaane ke liye patni or bete se pannon par panel grid banavaane kii madad lee
 moore ne 'ozemendius' ke ek varnan ko chota bhi kar diya kyonki gibans us samvaad ko ek prishth main sankshipt karne main asamarth the, jahaan ozemendius, rorak dwaara ek gupt hamale ko roktaa he
 In the final moments of the project, Moore realized that the story contained similarities from "the Architects of Fear," an episode of the television series The Outer Limits
 lekhak or wain ne kahani ke ant ko badalane par bahes kii; moore jeet gaye, lekin shrinkhalaa ke antim ank main dharawahik kaa hawala dete hue use sweekaar kiya

 After identifying the comedian's back face as Blake, a costumed hero employed by the US government, Rorschach thinks he has figured out a plot to end the costumed consorts and warns four of his retired comrades Gives Out: Daniel Dreiberg, the superpowered and emotionally abusive doctor Manhattan and his girlfriend Laurie Zaspezi and A

 aisa karke ve maanavtaa ko rajnatik sankat main daal dete hai, jiske tahat kathith america kamazori ko bhunaate hue soviet sangh afghanistan par hamalaa kar detaa he
 Rorschach's paranoid beliefs appear to be true when Adrian Wett narrowly escapes in an assassination attempt and Rorschach himself is convicted for the murder of Moloch, The Mystic, a former general secretary
 apane sambandh main upekshit or ab sarkaar dwaara sharnaagat ke taur par nahin rakhe gaye, zasapeji, dreberg ke saath rahata he; ve apni poshaakon ko dhaaran karte hai or jaise-jaise ek-duusare ke kareeb aate hai or phir se nigaraanee kaa kaam shuru karte hai
 When Dreiberg begins to believe certain aspects of Rorschach's conspiracy theory, the pair take upon themselves the responsibility of getting him out of prison
 doctor manahattan, apane nijee itihaas par waapas dekhne ke baad maanviya maamalon ke saath apni bhagidaari ke bhagya ko zasapeji ke haathon main saunp dete hai
 They teleport him to Mars for emotional investment in the case
 bahes ke dauraan, zasapeji is tathy ke saath saamanjasy baitaane ke liye majaboor hui ki blake, jisane ek baar uski maa kaa yon shoshan karne kii koshish kii thi, vastav main uskaa jaivik pita he
 This discovery, reflecting the complexity of human emotions, rekindles Doctor Manhattan's interest in humanity

 The evidence seems to be behind Adrian Vet's plan
 rorak apni patrika main wet ke bare main apane shaq ko likhte hai or ise neuyork main ek chota dakshinpanthi akhbaar, new frontiars main ko bhej dete hai
 The pair then face Watt on his Antarctic retreat
 wet bataata he ki uski yojana america or soviet sangh ke bich sambhavit parmaanu yuddh se maanavtaa ko bachaane kii he jiske tahat vah neuyork shahar main ek jhootha videshi akraman karegaa, jisamen shahar kii aadhi aabaadi kaa vinaash ho jayega

 Finding his argument harsh and disgusting, Dreiberg and Rorschach try to stop him, but see that Watt has already executed his plan
 jab doctor manahattan or zasapeji prithvi par waapas aate hai, to unka saamana neuyork city main samuhik vinaash or vyapak mauton se hota he
 Doctor Manhattan notices that their abilities are limited by the Antarctic-originated tachyon and the pair teleport there
 ve wet ke shaamil hone kaa pataa lagaate hai or uske saamne jate hai
 Watt shows the news broadcast confirming the end of global hostilities and mutual cooperation against a new threat, inspired by this, almost everyone present there agrees that it will be in the best interest of the world to conceal the truth of Vat from the public To be kept united
 Rorschach denies the agreement and, intent on leaving the truth, leaves
 waapas lautate vakt uskaa saamana manahattan se hota he
 Rorschach tells him that Manhattan must kill him in order to stop him from breaking up with Wet and his actions, and in response, Manhattan vaporizes him
 iske baad manahattan taal main bhatakta he or uski mulaaqaat wet se hoti he, jo manahattan se poochta he ki kya usne ant main sahi kaam kiya
 In response, Manhattan says "nothing ever ends" before moving to a different galaxy from Earth
 Dreiberg and Zaspezi go underground with a new identity and their romance continues

 The series concludes with the young man heading to a pile of rejected productions, on top of which Rorschach's magazine is kept

 Moore did not believe in the notion of "overturning morality" down readers' throats and trying to show the hero in an ambivalent light
 moore ne kaha, "darasal ham in logon ko, massa or sab dikhaanaa chaahate the
 Wanted to show that even the worst of them had something good for them and even the best of them had their flaws

 The character appears in previews throughout the story, and aspects of his personality are revealed to other characters

 Moore and Gibbons saw The Comedian as "a kind of Gordon Liddy character, just too big, tough guy"
 Richard Reynolds described The Comedian as "capable of a deeper insight into the role of a hero with a brutal, eccentric and nihilistic but costumed hero"

 However, the author felt that instead of manipulating Captain Atom, he could do more with Manhattan "like a quantum superhero"

 Moore incorporated color into the story and Gibbons stated that the rest of the color scheme of the comics made Manhattan unique
 Moore recalled that he was skeptical about whether DC would allow the creators to portray the character as completely naked, which partially affected the portrayal of the character
 manahattan kii nagnata ke chithran main gibans ruchikar hona chaahate the, sampoorn agr bhaag kii prastuti ke samay dhyaan se chayan karte hue or use "kamatar" jananaang dete hue - ek shastreey murtikla kii tarah - to isse shuruuaat main pathak kaa dhyaan is par nahin jayega
 Daniel Dreiberg / The Night Owl II: a retired superhero who uses owl-themed devices
 nit oul blue bital ke ted cord sanskaran par aadhaarit tha
 Just as Ted Cord was a predecessor, Moore also included a former adventurer in Watchmen, using the name "night Owl", retired crime fighter Hollis Mason
 While Moore made character notes for Gibbons to work, the painter provided the name Hollis Mason and a costume design he had made when he was twelve years old

 mana jaataa he ki wet is grah par sabase hoshiyaar aadmi he
 Ozimandius is directly based on Peter Cannon, Thunderbolt, who Moore praised for making full use of his brain capacity as well as having complete physical and mental control
 richard renolds ne kaha ki "duniya kii madad" karne kii pahal kar ke, wet ne ek aisa lakshan dikhaaya, jo saamaanya rup se superhiro kahaniyon main khalanaayak main parilakshith hota he or ek arth main vah shrinkhalaa kaa 'khalanaayak' he
 Gibbons said "one of the worst of his sins is to see humanity with a low vision, hating the rest of humanity
" " Walter Kovacs / Rorschach: a sentinel, who wears a white mask with constantly changing symmetrical ink spots, continues to fight against crime despite his robbery status
 moore ne kaha ki ve "is adarsh steve ditco charitra ko banane kii koshish kar rahe the - koi aisa jiskaa naam mazedaar ho, jiskaa upnaam 'K' se shuru hota ho, jiskaa ek ajeeb tarah se dizin kiya hua mukhauta ho"
 moore ne rorak ko, ditco kii rachana mr
a par aadhaarit kiya; ditco ke charlton charitra da queshchan ne bhi rorak ke nirmaan main ek khaake ke rup main kaary kiya
 Comics historian Bradford W
 Wright explained the world perception of the character as "a black-and-white set of values that take many shapes but are never found in a gray mixture, similar to the ink stain test of his name
" Rorschach sees existence as random, and according to Wright, this approach frees the character "to pursue his will on a 'morally vacant world'"
 moore ne kaha ki unhen rorak kii mrityu kaa chauthe ank tak abhas nahin tha, jab unhone mahasoos kiya ki samjhauta se unke inkaar se ve kahani ko jivit nahin rakh paaenge
 Laurie Zaspezi / Silk Spector II: Sally Jupiter's daughter with whom she has a strained relationship and The Comedian
 moore or gibans ne comics madhyam ke anuthe gunon ko pradarshit karne or isaki vishesh shaktiyon ko ujagar karne ke liye wachamen dizine kiya
 In a 1986 interview, Moore stated, "I want to try to find areas where comics have succeeded and where no other media has been able to function" and emphasize the differences between comics and film Let's emphasize this
 Moore stated that Watchmen was made "to read four or five times," under which there were some links and hints that were only apparent to the reader after reading several times
 dev gibans likhte hai ki, " yah aage badha, wachamen, kahani se zyaada, kehane ke dhang par kendrit ho gaya
 The main thrust of the story is essentially what it calls a megafin, a gimmick 


 so the plot isn't really that impressive
 

 yah vastutah wachamen ke bare main sabase dilachasp baat nahin he
 As we got closer to narrating the story, the real creativity started from there
 gibans ne kaha ki unhone jaanboojh kar wachamen ke drishy swaroop kaa nirmaan kiya, taaki prayek prishth ko us vishesh shrinkhalaa ke hisse ke rup main pahachaanaa ja sake or "kisi anya comic pustak ke nahin"
 unhone comics main saamanytah dekhe jane vaale paatro se alag chitrit karne ke liye thos prayaas kiya
 The painter John Higgins used a template that was "mind-blowing" and preferred secondary colors
 Moore said that he "always liked John's colors, but always associated with him as an airbrush painter", who Moore was not fond of, Higgins later decided to dabble with European-style
 moore ne kaha ki kalakaar ne prakaash or sookshm rang parivartan par vishesh dhyaan diya; ank chah main, higgins ne "garmjoshi or umang vaale" rangon se shuru kiya or is puure ank main kahani ko syah or dhoomil bhav dene ke liye, dhire-dhire rangon ko gaharaa karte gaye
 Structurally, Watchmen deviated from the rules of comics books of the time in some aspects, particularly in terms of panel layouts and colors
 Instead of variously sized panels, the creators divided each page into nine panel grids
 gibans ne iske "adhikaar" ke kaaran nau panel grid pranali ko pasand kiya
 Moore accepted the use of the nine-panel grid format, which, according to Gibbons, "gave him a level of control over narrative reading that he did not have before"
 "there was such an element of motion and visual impact that they could now anticipate and use it for dramatic effect
 " da comics jarnal ke bhob stewart ne 1987 main gibans se ullekh kiya ki pej le-out EC comics kii yaad dilaataa he, khud kala ke alaava, jisamen stewart ko vishesh rup se jon sevarin kii pratidhwani mahasoos hui
 gibans sahamat the ki EC style ke le-out kii gunj "ek bahut hi jaan boojhkar kii jane vaali baat thi", haalanki unki prerana harvey kurtzaman the, lekin ise shrinkhalaa ko ek anoothaa rup dene ke liye kaaphi badal diya gaya
 The front page of each issue serves as the first panel for the story
 gibans ne kaha, "wachamen kaa mukh-prishth yatharth duniya main he or bahut asli dikhataa he, lekin yah ek comics pustak main badalane laga, ek duusare aayam kaa pravesh-dwaar
" mukh-prishthon ko chlose-aps ke rup main taiyaar kiya gaya tha, jo bina insaani tatwon kii maujuudagi ke, ek ekal vistaar par dhyaan kendrit karata he
 On several occasions the creators experimented with the content lay-out of the points
 gibans ne "fwerphul cymmetry" sheershak ke ank paanch ko banaaya, to pehla prishth, antim ko pratibimbit karata he, centre sprad se pehle ek duusare ko pratibimbit karte nimna panne le-out main samamit hai
 At the end of each issue are supplementary passages written by Moore

 unhone shrinkhalaa kii prishthkatha bharne ke liye atirikt prishthon ke upyog kaa faisla kiya
 Moore said, "by the time we got to the # 3, # 4 or so forth, we thought the book looked good without the letter pages
 yah ek comics kii kitaab kii tarah kam hi lag rahi thi, isliye ham isi par tike rahe
 Watchmen presents the story in a story as Tales of the Black Frater, a fictional comic book whose scenes appear in points three, five, eight, ten and eleven
 kaalpanik comic kahani, "marund", neuyork shahar main ek yuvak dwaara padhi jaati he
 Moore and Gibbons envisioned a pirate comic, arguing that since Watchmen characters experience superheroes in real life, "they probably have little interest in superhero comics
 " gibans ne ek samudri daaku vishay kaa suzav diya or moore aanshik rup se isse sahamat hue, kyonki ve "bertolt bract kaa bada prashansak hai": bract ke thripeni opera se Seeräuberjenny geet sun kar da blike frater ishaara samajhataa he
 Moore theorized that since superheroes exist and exist as an "object of fear, hatred, and reproach, the major superheroes in comic books quickly went beyond popularity, as we have suggested
" khaas kar, lokapriyata ke shikhar par ek ke hote hue, bhayanak, vaigyanik or chori kii sheliyaan, vishesh rup se pramukh ban gai
 Moore felt that "the imagination of the entire pirate genre is so rich and dark that it gave a perfect answer to the contemporary world of Watchmen
" The author expanded on this premise, so that its presentation would add subtext and metaphor to the story
 a supplemental article detailing the fictional history of Tales of the Black Frater at the end of issue five, credits real-life artist Joe Orlando as a major contributor to the series
 moore ne orlando ko chunaa, kyonki unhone mahasoos kiya ki agar samudri daaku kathaayen wachamen brahmad main lokapriy hotin, to DC sampadak julius shwartz ne company main samudri daaku comic pustak kii ore aakarshith karne ke liye chitrakaar ko lubhaane kii koshish kii hogi

 When he finally returns home, he realizes that the Black Frater contingent has been captured, kills an innocent couple and then attacks his own wife as a pirate in their dark home
 apane kiye krity kaa ehsaas hone ke baad, vah samudr tat par lautataa he, jahaan vah paata he ki blike frator shahar kaa daawa karne nahin aayaa tha, balki vah us par daawa karne aayaa tha
 He swims in the sea and boarded the ship
 richard renold ke anusaar, navik "uske mishan ke mahatv kii vadoh se ek ke baad ek avrodh hataane ke liye majaboor hota he
 "like Watt, he hopes to avert disaster by using the dead bodies of his former comrades as a means to reach his goal"
 Moore said that the story of the Black Frater was particularly "the story of Adrian Vet
" The saying ends and that it can also be used as an answer to other parts of the story, such as the capture of Rorschach and Dr
 Manhattan's self-exile to Mars
 moore ne wachamen kii avadharana ke dauraan apane mukhya prabhaavon main wiliam es baro kaa naam liya
 In Burrow's only comic strip, "the Unspeakable Mr
 Heart", published in the British underground magazine Cyclops, he praised Barrow's "frequent use of symbols that were full of meaning"
 Not every interpersonal relationship in the series was planned by Moore, who remarked that "there are some things put out by Dave that i only noticed when i read it for the sixth or seventh time," while other "things 


 came there unknowingly
" 
 " ek khun se sanaa hua smaili cheharaa kahani main ek aavarti chhavi he, jo kai roopon main dikhaai detaa he
 In The System of Comics, Thierry Gronstein mentions the symbol as a recurring motif, presenting key parts of Watchmen, creating rhyme and notable configurations ", especially in the first and last pages of the series
 Gronstein calls it a form of the ring, which appears throughout the story as a "geometric recurrent shape" and in its symbolic Because of the meaning
 Gibbons created a smiley-faced badge to "brighten" the overall design as an element of The Comedian's costume, and later splashed blood to indicate his blood
 Gibbons Said creator, seeing its resemblance to the clock ticking until midnight, began to regard the blood-stained smiley face as "a symbol for the whole series"
 Scientific took inspiration from the trials, ankhon par khun ke chhidkaav ke saath hi chehre kaa arth ek hi samay main badal kar pehle ank ke mukhaprishth ke liye, maanav vivaranon se bachate hue swaabhaavik or saadhaaran ban gaya
 Although most of the calls to the central image were deliberately created, others were coincidental
 moore ne khaas taur se ullekh kiya ki "spark hidrent par chote plag, yadi aap unhen ulta karenge, to aapako ek chota smaili cheharaa dikhegaa"
 Other symbols, images, and signs that appeared several times throughout the series often emerged unexpectedly
 Moore pointed out that "all the talk with Watchmen has been with these small cohesiveness emerging everywhere"
 Gibbons found that an unexpected subject was opposed to the mundane and romantic, citing isolated sex scenes between Night Owl and Silk Spector on her couch and then on Night Owl's airship in the high sky
 In a book on the trough and stones of Mars, Gibbons saw the galley trough, which resembled a delighted face, on which he worked in an issue
 moore ne kaha, "hamane dekha ki aisi bahut-si chizein khud-ba-khud jaise jaadu kii tarah panpane lageen", vishesh rup se ek avasar kaa hawala dete hue, jahaan unhone ek taala company kaa namakaran karne kaa faisla kiya "gordian note lock company"
 The initial premise for the series was to test what superheroes would be like in "a believable, real world"
 As the story became more complex, Moore stated that Watchmen became "about power and the idea of superman representation within society"
 shrinkhalaa kaa sheershak is sawaal "wachamen koun dekhtaa he?" ko sanderbhit karata he, haalanki moore ne ameging heroj ke saath 1986 ke ek saakshaatkaar main kaha ki unhen nahin pataa ki us vaakya kii utpatti kahaan hui
 saakshaatkaar padhane ke baad, lekhak harlan ellison ne moore ko bataaya ki yah vaakya roman vyangyakaar juvenal dwaara uthaaye gaye "quis custodiet ipsos custodes?" sawaal kaa anuwaad he
 Moore commented in 1987, "in the context of Watchmen, it fits perfectly
 ve hamaare liye nigaraanee kar rahe hai, unke liye koun nigaraanee kar rahaa he? wachamen ke graphitti hardcover kii bhoomika main lekhak ne kaha ki shrinkhalaa likhte samay, superhiro kii apni puraani yaadon se vah khud ko ubaar sakaa or balki vaastavik manushyon main uski ruchi paidaa ho gai
 Bradford Wright described Watchmen as "moore's obituary for the concept of hero in general and superhero in particular"
 kahani ko ek samakaleen saamaajik sandarbh main rakhte hue rhite ne likhaa ki wachamen ke paatr, moore kii "un logon ko chetavanee the, jo duniya ke bhagya kii raksha ke liye 'hero' or netaaon par bharosa karte hai
 "he went on to believe that believing in such arachnids / personalities means leaving personal responsibility to" Reigns, Thatchers and other 'watchmen' of the world who supposedly protect us and perhaps the planet in the process
 "
 Moore specifically stated in 1986 that he was writing to Watchmen to be" anti-americanism, not anti-reaganism ", especially considering that b "there is no fear of Reagan in some part of America at this moment
 unhen lagata he ki ve abhedya rahe hai
 "while Moore wanted to write about" the politics of power "and the period of" anxiety "he lived in, he cited the reason why the story was composed in an alternate reality that he worried if he saw a leader Attacked, whose readers are fans, they would like "change
" Moore said in 1986 that he was "deliberately trying to do something that would make people feel uncomfortable
" wachamen ko aise bindu ke rup main hawala dete hue jahaan comic pustak kaa madhyam "apni simaaon se upar uthaa", ine thomson ne apane niabandh "decnstructing da hero" main likhaa ki "apane nayakon ko nayak kii thik avdhaaran kaa vikhandan karne ke liye viksit kiya or is tarah hamen zamin par gire thikaron ke vibhinn konon se iske mahatv par chintan karne ke liye protsaahit karte hue" kahani ne yah kaary puraa kiya
 Thomson stated that almost all the protagonists in Watchmen share a pernicious form, and Moore presented the form as a "straight, simple truth" to "dissect the ideal motivation of the future hero, namely , To provide a secular liberation and thus achieve a mortal immortality "
 He wrote that the story "develops its heroes so that we are asked if we really will not live better without heroes
" Thomson went on to say that the fragmentation of the protagonist concept by the story "suggests that the time for the protagonists may have passed now", which, according to them, distinguishes "this postmodern work" from the fragmentation of the protagonist in the existentialist movement
 
 richard renolds kehete hai ki kahani main bina kisi mahakhlanaayak ke wachamen ke superhiro "apekshaakrit adhik amoort saamaajik or naitik sarokaaron" kaa saamana karne ke liye majaboor hote hai", unhone aage kahaan ki yah, is vidha kii saamaanya varnanaatmak apekshaaon se superhiro kii avadharana ko hataa detaa he
 Reynolds concludes that the ironic self-awareness of the genre of the series "characterizes Watchmen as either the last in major superhero lessons or the first in a new maturity of genre"
 jyoff clok ne "vikhandan" shabd se parhez karte hue wachamen kii vyakhya "ek sanshodhanatmak superhiro aakhyaan" ke rup main karnaa pasand kiya

 Keep it

 Gibbons said that while readers were "left with the idea that this is a serious and unpleasant thing", he said the series "is as much a celebration of superheroes as anything else
" " jab moore or gibans ne wachamen kaa pehla ank DC ko pesh kiya to unke saathi dang rah gaye
 Gibbons recalls, "the one who really gripped it was Howard Chekin, who didn't praise easily, and he said, 'dave what you've done on Watchmen is absolutely' a '"
 " 1986 main bolte hue, moore ne kaha ki "DC ne hamen har tarah se samarthan diya

 ' kahani ke swaamitv ko lekar asahmati ne antat alan moore ko DC comics ke saath sambandh todane ke liye baadhya kiya
 Moore and Gibbons had a repatriation clause in the contract for Watchmen due to their desire not to work under the rent-for-work arrangement
 1985 san diego comic-con par bolte hue moore ne kaha "jis tarah se yah kaam karata he, agar main ise samajhataa hum, to yah aisa he ki jab se DC iskaa prakaashan kar rahe hai ve iske maalik hai or phir yah dev or mere paas waapas aata he, taaki ham us slorpi cap se paise bana saken

 On the other hand, if the characters have exceeded their natural lifespans and DC doesn't want anything to do with them, then after a year they will meet us and we can do what we want to do with them, making me fully Am happy with moore ne kaha ki unhone wachamen ke liye anubandh main bhashaa ke kaaran or kalakaar david loyad ke saath unke ve for vendata shrinkhalaa ke liye 1989 main DC chhod diya

 Since 1986, when producers Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver obtained the film rights to the series for 20th Century Fox, there have been several attempts to produce a film version of Watchmen
 fox ne alan moore se unki kahani par aadhaarit ek patakatha likhane ko kaha, lekin unhone manaa kar diya, to studio ne chalchitr ke kathanak likhanewaale sam ham ko soochibaddh kiya
 Hamm took advantage of this opportunity, rewriting the "more manageable" conclusion, incorporating Watchman's complicated ending with a murder and a time paradox
 Fox put the project into turnaround in 1991, and the project went to Warner Bros
, where Terry Gilliam directed and Charles Macione joined in rewriting it
 He used the Rorschach character's diary for a backdrop and restored scenes from the comic book that Haim had removed
 ghilium or silver film ke liye keval $25 milian hi ikattha kar paae kyonki unki pichhali filmein bajet se zyada ho gai thim
 Gilliam abandoned the project because he decided that Watchmen could not be filmed
 "making two or two-and-a-half-hour films short was something i felt was like removing the essence of Watchmen," he said
 "warner Bros
 After the project was rejected by Gordon, Gordon invited Gilliam back to conduct the film independently

 In July 2004, it was announced that Watchmen would be produced by Paramount Pictures and they added Darren Aronofsky to direct Hayter's screenplay
 Producers Gordon and Levine were involved in a partnership with Aronofsky's production partner, Eric Watson
 Paul Greengrass replaced Aronofsky when he left it to focus on The Fountain
 Ultimately, Paramount hired Watchmen to turnaround
 aktubar 2005 main, gordon or levin, film ko phir se vahaan viksit karne ke liye, warner bros se mili
 300 par jaik snidar ke kaam se prabhavit hokar warner bros ne wachamen ke roopantaran ko nirdeshit karne ke liye unase sampark kiya
 Screenwriter Alex Tse took his favorite elements from Hatter's screenplay, but returned it to the original setting of Watchmen's Cold War
 Like his approach in 300, Snyder used the comic book as a narrative board
 unhone ladaai ke drishyon ko badhaayaa or film ko adhik samayik banane ke liye urja sansadhano ke bare main ek up kathanak joda
 haalanki unka comic main kirdaaron ke swaroop ke saath eemaandaar rahane kaa iraadaa tha, sneader chaahate the ki nit oul thoda or daraavna dikhe or ozimndius ke kavach ko 1997 kii superhiro film bitman and robin ke rabad mansapeshiyon ke suut kii parody bana diya

 While 20th Century Fox filed a lawsuit to block the film's release, the studio eventually settled and Fox received one percent from the worldwide proceeds of the film and its sequels and byproducts, with an upfront payment

 Dave Gibbons became a consultant on Snyder's film, but Moore refused to add his name to any film adaptation of his work
 Moore stated that he is not interested in seeing Snyder's conversion; He told Entertainment Weekly in 2008, "we've done a few things in Watchmen that only work in a comic and were actually designed to show things other media can't show"
 While Moore believes that David Hatter's screenplay was "as close to Watchmen as i can imagine," he firmly stated that if the film was made, he had no intention of watching it
 jari hone ke baad se, wachamen ko comic pustak ke madhyam main ek moulik kaary ke rup main saraahna praapt hui he
 In Art of the Comic Book: An Aesthetic History, Robert Harvey writes that Moore and Gibbons, through Watchmen, "demonstrated a never-before-seen genre of narration to tell a sophisticated story that was only in comics Can be composed "
 In his review of the collection's Absolute Edition, Dave Itzkopf of The New York Times wrote that Watchmen's dark legacy, "one that Moore almost never intended, whose DNA is encoded in progressively black ink and tarnished plots, Contemporary superheroes have become an essential element of comic book "," a domain that he has largely handed over to writers and artists who have been ruthless
 Yath shares his fascination but is not interested in his results, his eagerness to break old boundaries, but not in search of new boundaries
 " in 1999, The Comics Journal placed Watchmen at number 91 on its list of the top 100 comics of the 20th century English language

" In 2009, Brain Scan Studios released Watchmensch, which serves as a parody of the series, "the comics industry, the movies they create and the producers / creators who crush on it"
 Valerie d'orezio of Occasional Superheroine elaborates on this detail, noting that although she usually flaunts comic book parody, Watchmance differs in that it is actually "watchmen creator Alan Moore and DC Comic Between, there is a metaphor about the rift - and, broadly, a musing on the issue of the creator's authority "and he further calls it" the fictional story of the comic book industry " said
 She further praises Swedish artist Simone Rörmüller for capturing the artistic style of Dave Gibbons, whom "the reader may forget for a moment that he is reading a parody

 a black hole is often defined as an object whose migration velocity is greater than the speed of light
 yah tasvirgunatmak rup se galat he lekin kalenidr kii trigya ke pariman ke kram ko samajhane kaa ek tarika pradaan karti he
 The escape velocity is the minimum speed an object must have so that the object escapes the orbit of a gravitational source before stopping
 prithvi par palaayan veg 11

2 kimi / second kii gati se chalanaa hoga
 To calculate the migration velocity in Newtonian mechanics, suppose there is a heavy object whose mass m is centered at the origin
 ek m { \ displaystyle m} dravyaman vaali duusari vastu mul se r { \ displaystyle r} kii duuri par v { \ displaystyle v} gati se shuru hoti he, infinity kii taraf bachakar nikalne kii koshish karti he, iske paas thik utani gatij urja honi chahie taaki vah nakaaratmak gurutvkarshan kii sambhavit urja se paar paa sake, baad main kuch bhi shesh na rahe: Thus, as it gets closer to r = ∞ { \ displaystyle r = \ infty}, its kinetic energy decreases, eventually reaching infinity without any motion
 yah formula critical palaayan veg v { \ displaystyle v} ko m { \ displaystyle M} or r { \ displaystyle r} ke sandarbh main darshata he
 But this formula also says that for each value of v { \ displaystyle v} and m { \ displaystyle M}, r { \ displaystyle r} has a critical value so that v { \ displaystyle v} is a particle of motion
 Only managed to escape: jab veg prakaash kii gati ke baraabar ho, yah ek kaalpanik neutonian dark star kii trigya pradaan karata he, ek neutonian sharir jahaan se prakaash kii gati se chalane vaala koi kan batch nahin saktaa he
 In the trend most commonly used for the value of the radius of a black hole, the radius of the event horizon is equal to this Newtonian value
 saamaanya saapekshata main, antariksh-samay kii vakrit prakruti or vibhinn nirdeshaankon ke chayan kii vajah se r nirdeshaank ko paribhaashit karnaa saral nahin he
 For this result to be true, the value of r must be defined so that r radius in curved space times a surface area of A sphere can still be revealed by this formula a = 4 π r 2 { \ displaystyle a This definition of = 4 \ pi r ^ {2}} r makes sense only if the gravitational field is spherically symmetric, so that there are many jackals on top of one that have a uniform gravitational field
 kisi vastu ke gurutvkarshan kshetra se batch nikalne ke liye palaayan veg uske ghanatv par nirbhar karti he; yah he, uske dravyaman or maatra kaa anupaat
 a black hole is formed when an object becomes so dense that even light cannot escape from it for a particular distance, because the speed of light will be less than the escape velocity of the black hole
 neutonian gurutvkarshan ke vipareet, saamaanya saapekshata main, kalenidr se dur jaataa hua prakaash dhimaa nahin padataa he or vaapis nahin mudata he
 The Schwarzschild radius is still the last distance from which the light can escape to infinity, but the exit light, starting at the Schwarzschild radius, does not return, it remains outside
 schvarjaschild trigya andar, prayek vastu andar kii taraf gati karti he, kisi prakaar centre main kuchle jane hetu
 In general relativity, the mass of the black hole may remain centered on a gravitational singularity), it may be a point, a ring, a light beam, or a sphere; At present, exact information about it is not available
 is singhulerity ke aasapaas ek golakaar seemaa hoti he jise ghatana kshitij kaha jaataa he
 It is the 'returning place' to the event horizon, a boundary beyond which all matter and radiation are drawn towards the singularity within
 kendrastha is singhulerity or ghatana kshitij ke bich kii duuri kalenidr kaa aakaar hoti he or yah ikai main dravyaman ke dugane ke baraabar hoti he jahaan g or c baraabar 1 hai
 The radius of a black hole with a mass equal to the Sun is about 3 km

 Therefore, if the Sun is converted into a black hole of equal mass, the orbits of the planets will remain unchanged
 kai prakaar ke kalenidr hai, jo unke vishisht aakaar dwaara pahachaane jate hai
 When they form due to the gravitational collapse of a star, they are called stellar black holes
 gallexiyon ke centre main banane vaale kalahidron ke dravyaman saura dravyaman ke kai arab guna ho sakate hai, unhen vishalkay kaala chhidr kaha jaataa he kyonki ve ati vishaal hote hai
 There are also some intermediate black holes between these two scales, whose mass is up to several thousand times the solar mass
 bahut kam dravyaman vaale kalenidr kaa, jinke bare main aisa mana jaataa he ki unka nirmaan brahmand ke shuruaati itihaas main big baing ke dauraan hua hoga, ab bhi astitv bhi ho sakate hai or unhen primoradial kalachhidr kaha jaataa he
 Presently, their existence is not yet certain
 pratyaksh taur par ek kalenidr ko dekh paanaa sambhav nahin he
 However, its presence can be gauged by its gravitational effect on the surrounding environment, particularly by microvasives and active galactic nuclei, where substances falling into nearby black holes overheat and emit large amounts of X-ray radiation Huh
 yah prekshan vidhi khagolavidon ko unke astitv kaa pataa lagane main sakasham banaati he
 Black holes are the only substances that meet these scales and conform to the framework of general relativity
 ek aise baari sharir kii avadharana jisase ki prakaash bhi bachane se asamarth ho ko, bhuvigyaani jon michel dwaara 1783 main henry kavendish ko likhe gayi ek patr main prakat kiya gaya tha or royal socity dwaara prakashit kiya gaya tha: In 1796, mathematician pierre-simon Laplace promoted the idea in the first and second editions of his book Exposition du sistem du Monde
 unnisvin sadi main in "dark stars" par dhyaan nahin diya gaya tha, kyonki tab aisa mana jaataa tha ki prakaash drabyaman rahit tarang he atah gurutv ke prabhaav se mukt he
 Contrary to the modern black hole concept, it was believed that the object behind the horizon could not collapse
 1915 main, albert oinstin ne apane saamaanya saapekshata ke siddhant ko viksit kiya, ve pehle hi yah siddh kar chuke the ki gurutvkarshan prakaash kii gati par vastav main prabhaav daalata he
 a few months later, Karl Schwarzschild gave the solution of the gravitational field of a point mass and a spherical mass, showing that the existence of a black hole is theoretically possible
 schvarjaschild trigya ko ab gaiyr-chakrit blike hole ke ghatana kshitij kii trigya ke rup main janaa jaataa he, lekin is tathy ko us samay nahin samajha ja sakaa tha, udhaaharan ke liye schvarjaschild khud ise bhautik nahin maanate the
 Johannes Droste, a student of Hendrik Lorentz, independently gave a similar solution a few months after Schwarzschild on point mass and wrote extensively more about its properties
 1930 main, khagolvid subramanyan chandrashekhar nen saamaanya saapekshata kaa upyog karte hue yah gananaa kii ki electron-dijanret padaarth vaale ek gaiyr-chakrit sharir kaa saura dravyaman yadi 1
44 se adhik hua to uskaa patan ho jaayegaa
 His argument was opposed by Arthur Eddington, who believed that something would surely prevent this collapse
 edington aanshik rup se sahi the: chandrashekhar seemaa se thoda adhik drabyaman vaala safed bouna sitara patan ke baad neutron taare main parivartit ho jaayegaa
 lekin 1939 main, robert oppenheimer or unke sahyogiyon ne bhavishyavaanee kii ki chandrasekhar dwaara die gaye kaarnon kii vajah se, lagbhag teen se adhik saura drabyaman vaale sitara kaa patan ek blike hole ke rup main ho jaayegaa
 Oppenheimer and his co-authors used the Schwarzschild coordinate system, which produced mathematical specificity at the Schwarzschild radius, in other words, some of the components used in this equation became infinite at the Schwarzschild radius
 iskaa arth yah niklaa gaya ki schvarjaschild trigya ek "bulbule" kii seemaa thi jisamen samay "ruk" jaataa tha
 This is a valid point of view from outside, but not for those who fall inside
 is visheshta ke kaaran, patan ho chuke taron ko kuch samay ke liye "frozen stars " ke naam se janaa gaya, kyonki ek bahari paryvekshak ko taare kii sataha us samay main jami hui dikhaai degaa jis pal main taare kaa patan use schvarjaschild trigya ke andar le ja rahaa hoga
 This is a known feature of modern black holes, but it must be emphasized that the surface light of the frozen star redshifts very quickly and turns the black hole to black very quickly
 kai bhautikavid is vichaar ko sweekaar nahin kar paa rahe the ki schvarjaschild trigya ke bheetar samay ruk jaataa he or 20 varshon tak is bishay par logon ki ruchi nahin rahi thi
 In 1958, David Finkisten introduced the concept of the event horizon by presenting Eddington – Finkelstein coordinates, which enabled him to prove that the Schwarzschild surface r = 2 m is not a specificity but rather serves as an ideal monolithic membrane
 Is: The causal effects can cross it in one direction
 isamen or openhimer ke parinaamon ko koi khaas virodhabhas nahin tha, balki isane ek andar girte hue paryvekshak ke drushtikon ko shaamil karke iskaa vistaar hi kiya
 All theories up to now, including Finkelstein, covered only non-rotating black holes
 1963 main, roy ker ne aavarti blike hole ke liye ekadam sateek samaadhaan khoj liya
 Its rotated singularity was not a dot but a ring
 kuch samay baad, roger penros yah sabit karne main sakasham ho gayi ki singhulerity sabhi blike holon ke andar pai jaati hai
 In 1967, astronomers discovered Pulsar and within a few years were able to prove that the known Pulsars are fast-rotating neutron stars
 us samay tak, neutron taare bhi sirf saidhantik utsukata tak hi simit the
 Hence the discovery of pulsars aroused interest in all those high-density objects whose structure would have been possible by gravitational collapse
 bhautikavid jon whealer ko vyapak rup se 1967 main die gaye apane saarvajanik bhaashan hamaara brahmad: gyaat or agyaat main blike hole shabd ko gadhane kaa shrey diya jaataa he, adhik dushkar "gurutveey rup se purnatah patan ko praapt kar chukaa tara" ke ek vikalp ke rup main
 However, Wheeler insisted that the term was coined by someone else at the conference and he only adopted it as a useful short-word
 yah shabd 1964 main eni aving dwaara AAAS ko likhe ek patr main bhi uddhrut kiya gaya tha: When the entire fuel of a big star is burnt, a huge explosion occurs in it, which is called a supernova
 visphot ke baad jo padaarth bachataa he vah dhire dhire simatana shuru hota he or bahut hi ghaney pind kaa rup le letaa he jise neutron star kehete hai
 If the neutron star is too large, the pressure of gravity will be so low that it will shrink with its own weight and become so dense that a black hole will form and appear as a black hole, a black hole or a black hole
 no hair prameya main kaha gaya he ki, ek baar sthapit ho jane ke baad blike hole ke keval teen swatantra bhautik lakshan hote hai: dravyaman, charge or koniya gati
 If the values of these two black holes have the same values or parameters, then it becomes quite difficult to distinguish between them
 ye lakshan khaas hote hai kyonki ye blike hole ke baahar se dikhaai dete hai
 For example, a charged black hole, like any other charged object, pushes the same charge away, despite the fact that photons, which are responsible for the electrical and magnetic forces, do not escape the internal field
 iskaa kaaran he gous niyam, ek bade sphier se baahar nikalne vaala kul vidyut pravaah hameshaa samaan rahata he or sphier ke bheetar ke kul charge ko maapta he
 When the charge falls into the black hole, electric field lines persist and peek beyond the horizon, and these field lines conserve the total charge of all falling materials
 bijli kshetra line antat blike hole kii sataha par samaan rup se fail jaati hai, sataha par samaan kshetra line ghanatv sthapit karti hai
 In this context, the black hole acts like a common conducting sphere that has a certain resistivity
 isi tarah, blike hole ko samahit kiye hue ek sphere ke kul dravyaman ko gaus niyam ke gurutveey anuroop kaa upyog karke paaya ja saktaa he, blike hole se bahut dur baithe baithe
 Similarly, angular momentum can be measured from far away, by gravitational-magnetic field using frame dragging
 jab blike hole kisi padaarth ko nigalata he, uskaa kshitij gharshan yukt vistrut jhilli kii tarah dolan karata he, ek kshanik pranali, jab tak yah antim avasthaa main sthapit nahin ho jaataa
 This is different from other field theories such as electromagnetism or gauge theory, which never have any friction or resistivity because they are time reversible
 kyonki blike hole antat ek antim avasthaa main keval teen maapdandon ke saath sthapit hota he, praarambhik sthitiyon ke bare main jaankaree ko khone se bachaane kaa koi tarika nahin he: blike hole ke gurutvkarshan or vidyut kshetra uske andar jane vaali chizon ke bare main bahut kam jaankaree pradaan kar pate hai
 Missing information includes everything that cannot be measured at great distances from the black hole horizon, such as the total baryon number, the lepton number, and almost all other preserved pseudo-charges in particle physics
 yahan se karnaa he yah vyavhaar itnaa ajeeb he ki ise 'blike hole jaankaree nuksaan virodhabhas' kaha gaya he
 Traditionally, the disappearance of information in black holes is quite strange, because general relativity is a Lagrangian theory that appears to be time reversible and Hamiltonian from above
 lekin kshitij ke kaaran blike hole samay palatwaan nahin hota he: padaarth isamen ghus sakate hai par nikal nahin sakate
 The reversal of time in a common black hole is called a white hole, although entropy and quantum mechanics show that white holes are similar to black holes
 no-hair prameya hamaare brahmad or usamen shaamil padaarthon kii prakruti ke bare main kuch manyataon banaata he, jabaki anya manyatayen alag nishkarsh pradaan karti hai
 For example, if magnetic single-poles exist, as stated by some theories, magnetic charge would be the fourth parameter of a conventional black hole
 nimnlikhit maamalon ke liye no-hair prameya ke prati-udahaaran gyaat hai: These exceptions are sometimes unstable and sometimes do not lead away from black holes to newly preserved quantum numbers
 hamaare chaar-aiami or lagbhag sapaat brahmand main is prameya ko lagu hona chahie
 The simplest black hole is one that has a mass but has neither charge nor angular momentum
 in blike hole ko schvarjaschild blike hole ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, bhautikavid karl schvarjaschild ke naam par jinhone 1915 main is samaadhaan kii khoj kii thi
 This was the first reliable and accurate solution to be discovered for the Einstein field equation and according to the Birkhoff theorem it is the only vacuum solution that is spherically symmetric
 iskaa matlab yah he ki is tarah ke ek blike hole ke gurutvkarshan kshetra or samaan dravyaman kii kisi bhi anya golakaar vastu ke gurutvkarshan kshetra bich koi drishy antar nahin he
 For the black hole, the popular belief that it "pulls every object in" around itself is true only near its horizon; At a distance, its external gravitational field is essentially the same as that of ordinary heavy bodies
 blike hole ke adhik saamaanya samaadhaan 20 veen sadi ke uttarardh main khoje gayi the
 The Reisner – Nordström metric describes a black hole with electric charge, while the Kerr metric provides a rotating black hole
 kerr -newman metric saamanyatya adhik prachlit sthir blike hole samaadhaan he, jo charge or koniya gati donon kaa varnan karata he
 Although the mass of a black hole can take any positive value, charge and angular momentum are constrained by mass
 prakritik ikaayiyon main, kul charge q { \ displaystyle q \ ,} or kul koniya gati j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} se ummid kii jaati he ki ve nimnlikhit ko santusht karenge For a black hole with mass M
 is asamanta ko bharne vaale blike hole ko extrimal kaha jaataa he
 Solutions of Einstein's equations that violate inequality exist, but do not have horizons
 in samaadhaanon main nagn vishistataa he or inhen abhautik mana jaataa he, kyonki cosmik sensorship pariklpana vaastavik padaarthon ke samgr gurutvkarshan patan kii vajah se is vishistataa ko nakaar detii he
 This is supported by numerical representations
 vidyut chumbakeey bal kii apekshaakrit badi takat ke kaaran, taron ke patan se banane vaale blike hole se apeksha kii jaati he ki ve taron ke neutral charge ko banaaye rakhenge
 Rotation has been considered a common feature of compact objects and it appears that the angular momentum of the binary hole X-ray source GRS 1915 + 105, a candidate for a black hole, is close to its maximum possible value
 blike hole ko saamanytah unke dravyaman ke anusaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, koniya gati j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} se swatantra
 ghatana kshitij trigya, yaa shwarzschild trigya, dwaara nirdhaarit blike hole kaa aakaar dravyaman m { \ displaystyle m \ ,} ke anupaat main hota he, Where rsh { \ displaystyle r_ {sh} \ ,} is the Schwarzschild radius and m ⨀ { \ displaystyle m _ { \ bigodot}} is the mass of the Sun
 is prakaar ek blike hole kaa aakaar or dravyaman saadhaaran rup se sambandhit hote hai, roteshan se swatantra
 According to this criterion, black holes are classified as follows: blike hole kii vishistataa he ghatana kshitij kaa prakat hona; antariksh-samay kii ek seemaa jiske pare ghatnaayen ek bahari paryvekshak ko prabhavit nahin kar sakati hai
 As predicted by general relativity, the presence of mass distorts the space-time in such a way that the paths of the particles lead them to that mass
 blike hole ke ghatana kshitij par yah vikruti itani shaktishaalee ho jaati he ki baahar jane kaa koi maarg bachataa hi nahin he
