 brahmahatya ke bhay se ek baar jab indra jalgarbha main chhipe hue the to devataaon ne nahush ko indrapad de diya
 When Nahusha looked at Shachi, by the order of Jupiter, he worshiped Bhuvaneshwari and got abbey from him
 phir shachi ne maansarovar jaakar chhipe hue indra se apni sari katha kahi
 On Indra's advice, Shachi said to Nahusha, "if i come in a palanquin placed on the shoulder of the Saptarshi, i will go with you
" ' nahush ne aisa hi kiya
 Seeing the sages moving slowly, he ordered 'snake Snake' Finally Nahusha had to become a snake due to the curse of the sages

 There would be satsang overnight near the station, everyone would return to their respective places in the morning
 satsangke liye aajkalaki tarah na to manch banataa tha na prachaar hota tha
 In Kolkata, satsang used to be held only on the shop seats

 At first, the site near the fort behind the Eden Gardens of Kolkata was chosen, but the satsang could not be done properly there

 The influence of Shri Sethji's satsangas in Kolkata led to a growing group of seekers and everyone needed a Gita for health, but the Gita of pure text and true meaning was not being accessible

 It is not just the press to publish gitapress books, but the life-changing Gita, which has been blessed by the voice of God, has changed from being a preaching place to a holy place
 bhagwaan shastronmen swayan iskaa udghosh kiye hai ki jahaan mere namka samaran, prachaar, bhajan-kirthan ityadi hota he us stando main kabhi nahin tyaagta
 Along with the propagation of Geetaji, Sethji used to keep doing satsang for the attainment of God
 unhen ek shantipriy sthalki aavashyaktaa mahasoos hui jahaan kolahal na ho, pavitra bhoomi ho, saadhan-bhajanke liye ati aavashyak saamagree uplabdh ho
 To fulfill this requirement, Uttarakhand's Holy Bhoomipar visited Sethji around 1918 to perform Satsang
 vahaan gangapar bhagwati gangaake tatpar vatvriksh or vartmaan gitabhavankaa sthaan sethjico param shantidaayak laga
 It is heard that in the place of Vatavriksha, Swami Ramathirtha also did penance

 dhire-dhire satsangi bhaaiyonke rahaneke liye pakke makaan banane lage
 Today Bhagavatkripaas has become a well-organized and splendid building with more than 1,000 rooms and separate places for Satsang, bhajan-kirtan

 People come here and sit in the picturesque environment of Ganga ji and do Bhagavat thinking and satsang

 She was a fan of the Indian varna system
 parantu unke saamne samasya thi ki ise vyavhaarik kaise banaaya jaay taaki saamaajik tanaav kam ho
 He believed that there should be proper management of education
 shiksha main dharmik shiksha kaa samavesh ho
 To give such education, he founded the Central Hindu School in Varanasi in 1898
 saamaajik buraaiyon jaise bal vivaah, jati vyavastha, vidhwaa vivaah, videsh yatra aadi ko dur karne ke liye unhone 'bros of sarvice' naamak sanstha kaa sanghathan kiya

 Dr
 Annie Besant believed that it is not possible to solve all these difficulties without political freedom
 dow ani bessent swabhaavat: dharmik pravriti kii mahila thim
 The foundation of his political thought was his spiritual and moral values
 unka vichaar tha ki achchhai ke maarg kaa nirdhaaran bina aadhyatm ke sambhav nahin
 To achieve a welfare life, human desires should be subject to divine will
 raashtra kaa nirmaan evam vikaas tabhi sambhav he jab us desh ke vibhinn dharmon, manyataon evam samskritiyon main ekta sthapit ho
 Knowledge of true religion is attained only by spiritual consciousness
 unke in vichaaron ko mahatma gandhi ne bhi sweekaar kiya
 The nature of civilization and culture of ancient India was spiritual
 yahi aadhyatmikta us samay ke bharatiyon kii nidhi thi
 The aim of Dr
 Besant was to remove the distortions in Hindu society and its spirituality
 unhone bhartiya punarjanm main vishwaas karnaa shuru kiya
 She was convinced that she was a Hindu in a previous life
 vah dharm or vigyaan main koi bhed nahin maanati thim
 He had full faith in religious tolerance
 unhone bhartiya dharm kaa gambheer adhyayan kiya
 His translation of the Bhagavad Gita 'that's on the study of the Bhagavad Gita' is a proof that he had deep faith in Hindu religion and philosophy
 ve kaha karti thim ki hindu dharm main itane sampradaayon kaa hona is baat kaa pramaan he ki isamen swatantra bauddhik vikaas ko protsaahan diya jaataa he
 She believed that India only had the ability to guide the world
 ve bharat ke sadiyon se andh vishwaason se grast maanav ko mukt karnaa chaahati thim
 Dr
 Besant saw the ideal of service to the poor in socialism
 garibi dur karne ke liye unka vishwaas tha ki audyogikaran ho
 He saw that the woman had no freedom
 ve log bhoga kii vastu samajhi jaati thim
 Dr
 Besant's heart was moved by this sad state
 unhone nari suraksha kaa prashn uthaaya or jor dekar kaha ki samaaj main sarvangin vikaas ke liye nari adhikaron ko surakshit karnaa aavashyak he
 Dr
 Besant was an advocate of the ancient religion based varna system
 varna vyavastha kaa mukhya uddeshy kaary vibhaajan tha jiske anusaar samaaj kaa prayek vyakti apane kaaryon ko karne kii yogyata dwaara brahman, kshatriya, vaisya evam shudra kaa sthaan praapt karata tha
 She used to say that according to Mahabharata, a Brahmin has the qualities of a Shudra and is a Shudra
 shudra main agar brahman ke gun hai to vah brahman samajha jaayga
 Traveling abroad was considered irreligious at that time
 unhone bataaya ki pracheen aitihaasik tathyon se pataa chalata he ki shyaam, java, sumatra, kamboj, lanka, tibet tathaa china aadi deshon main hindu rajya ke chihn paye gayi hai
 Hence, foreign travel of Hindus is certified
 unhone videsh yatra ko protsaahan diye jane kaa samarthan kiya
 According to him, uplifting the nation with the combination of spiritual intelligence and physical strength has been the specialty of ancient India
 ve vidhwaa vivaah ko dharm maanati thim
 He believed that except adult widows, adolescent and youth widows should marry to prevent social evil
 ve antarjaatiy vivaahon ko bhi dharm sammat maanati thim
 She considered polygamy as an insult to women's pride and a curse of society
 kisi bhi desh ke nirmaan main prabud varg kii bhoomika mahatvapurn hoti he
 This enlightened class is a product of that country's education
 at: shiksha vyavastha ko ve atyadhik mahatv detii thim
 He insisted that religious and moral education should be compulsorily taught in education courses and to be based on ancient Indian ideals
 unki dharna thi ki prayek bhartiya ko sanskrit tathaa angreji donon kaa gyaan hona chaiye
 From 1913 to 1919 she was one of the leading personalities in Indian political life
 sitambar 1916 main unhone homerul lig kii sthapana kii or swarajya ke adarsh ko lokapriy banane ke liye prachaar kiya kintu 1919 ke baad ve akeli pad gayi
 The immediate reason for this was his dispute with Bal Gangadhar Tilak
 jab gandhi ji ne apana satyagrah aandolan prarambh kiya to vah bhartiya raajnneeti kii mukhya dhara se or bhi pruthak ho gai
 It is a matter of great misfortune that Annie Besant condemned Gandhiji's non-cooperation movement in a very unsympathetic language, describing his movement as revolutionary, anarchist, and a movement that exudes hatred and violence
 gandhi ke darshan evam netritv ko unhone swatantraaa ke maarg main sabase badi baadha bataaya tha
 He described Gandhiji as an obscure swaraj watcher and a mystic politician
 unhen is baat se sandeh tha ki gandhi ji sachche hriday se pashchaatap, upwas, tapasya aadi main vishwaas karte hai
 He warned the people of the country that if the Gandhian system was adopted, the country would again fall into the ravine of anarchy

 The Constitution of the new republic in India was launched on 26 January 1950 and for the first time in its long history, India became a full parliamentary democracy with a modern institutional structure
 26 navambar, 1949 ko bhartiya samvidhan sabha dwaara nirmit ‘bharat kaa samvidhan’ ke purv british sansad dwaara kai aise adhinium / charter paarit kiye gayi the, jinhen bhartiya samvidhan kaa aadhaar kaha ja saktaa he
 The rule of Bengal was vested in the Governor General and the four-member Council
 is parishad main nirnay bahumat dwaara liye jane kii bhi vyavastha kii gayi
 By this act, Warren Hastings was appointed to the Board of Administrators as Governor General and Clavering, Monson, Barwell and Pflip Francis were appointed as members of the Council
 in sabhi kaa kaarykaal paanch varsh kaa tha tathaa nideshak board kii sifarish par keval british samraat dwaara hi inhen hataaya ja saktaa tha
 Thus by the Act of 1773, the British Parliament interfered and controlled the affairs of the company in India, and for the first time a written constitution was introduced for the governance of the company
 is adhinium ke dwaara kalakatta kii sarkaar ko bengal, bihar or urisa ke liye bhi vidhi banane kaa adhikaar pradaan kiya gaya
 The Act was passed with the objective of establishing maximum control over the company and to save the falling credit of the company in India
 is adhinium ke dwaara governor general ko vishesh paristhitiyon main apni parishad ke nirnyon ko radd karne tathaa apane nirnay lagu karne kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 The Governor General also got the powers of Chief Commander
 company ke kaaryon evam sanghathan main sudhaar ke liye yah charter paarit kiya gaya
 The major feature of this charter was that it included all the important provisions of the earlier Acts
 is adhinium kii pramukh visheshtaayen nimna thim The Charter Act of 1813 was passed by the British Parliament due to the abolition of the company's monopoly, the demand for religious facilities in India by Christian missionaries, Lord Wellesley's aggressive policy in India, and the company's perceived economic condition
 ise pramukh praavdhaan nimna theah After the Act of 1813, the empire of the company in India increased considerably and the dominion of the British was established in Maharashtra, Central India, Punjab, Sindh, Gwalior, Indore etc
 isi prabhutv ko sthayitv pradaan karne ke liye 1833 kaa charter adhinium paarit kiya gaya
 Its main provisions were: is adhinium dwaara bharat main kendrikaran kaa prarambh kiya gaya, jiskaa sabase prabal pramaan vidhiyon ko samhitabaddh karne ke liye ek ayog kaa gathan tha
 Lord Macaulay was appointed the first chairman of this commission
 1853 kaa rajptr bhartiya shashan ke itihaas main antim charter act tha
 The Act was mainly based on the demand of the Indians to end the rule of the company and the report of the then Governor General Lord Dalhousie
 isaki pramukh visheshtaayen nimna thim Constitutional development during the Crown's reign 1853 kii charter main company ko shashan ke liye chunki kisi nishchit avadhi ke liye praadhikrut nahin kiya gaya tha, isliye kisi bhi samay satta kaa hastantaran british crown ko sansad ke dwaara hastantarit kiya ja saktaa tha
 The Ghadar of 1857 exposed unsatisfactory policies of governance, which gave Parliament an excuse to depose the company
 samrajya kii suraksha ke liye british sansad ne kai adhinium paarit kiye jo bhartiya prashasan kaa aadhaar bane
 The major provisions of the Act of 1858 were: 1 navambar, 1858 ko britain kii maharani victoria ne bharat ke sambandh main ek mahatvapurn nitigat ghoshnaa kii
 Important points of this announcement were: 1861 kaa bhartiya parishad adhinium bharat ke sanvaidhanik itihaas main ek mahatvapurn or ugantkaari ghatana he
 This is important for two main reasons
 ek to yah ki isane governor general ko apni vistaarit parishad main bhartiya janata ke pratinidhiyon ko namjad karke unhen vidhaayi kaary se sambhddha karne kaa adhikaar diya
 Secondly, it decentralized the legislative powers of the Governor General's Council, ie the governments of Bombay and Madras were also given legislative powers
 is adhinium kii anya mahatvapurn baaten nimna thim Following works were done under this Act: 1861 ke antargat gaiyr-sarkari sadsy yaa to bade jameendaar hote the yaa avkaash praapt adhikari yaa bharat ke raaj pariwaron ke sadsy
 This did not confirm the common aspiration of representation

 The Government of India has also been demanding from the European traders more independence from the India office in England
 sar jorge chijani kii adhyakshata main ek cameti bani jiske sujhaavon kaa samavesh 1892 ke adhinium main kiya gaya

 Apart from this the representation of classes was also biased

 main nayaa adhinium paarit kiya gaya jise bhartiya parishad adhinium 1909 or ‘marle-minto sudhaar’ ke naam se janaa gaya
 The major provisions of this Act were as follows: is adhinium kii sabase badi truti yah thi ki pruthak athwa sampradayik aadhaar par nirvachan kii paddati lagu kii gayi
 Apart from this, the election method adopted was so obscure that the system of public representation became a process of filtering out of many kinds of filters

 On 20 August 1917, the then Secretary of State for India, Mottegu made a landmark statement in the House of Commons, stating Britain's intention: isi ghoshnaa ko karyanvit karne ke liye ‘montford report-1918’ prakashit kii gayi, jo 1919 ke adhinium kaa aadhaar bana
 Important changes were made in the then Indian constitutional system by this act: 1919 ke adhinium main anek khamiyaan thim
 It did not meet the demand of responsible government
