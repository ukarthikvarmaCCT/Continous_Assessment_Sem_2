 kalhan kashmiri itihaaskaar tathaa vishwavikhyath granth rajtarangini ke rachayita the
 Kalhan was the forefather of Kanaka, the son of Mahampati Champaka of Maharaja Harshadeva of Kashmir
 mankhak ne shrikanthcharit main kalyaan naam ke isi kavi kii praudhata ko saraahaa he or ise mahaamantri alakadatt ke prashray main "bahukthakeliparishramanirankush' ghoshit kiya he
 In fact, Kalhan was a remarkable poet
 uski "saraswati' ragadwesh se alep rahakar "bhutarthchitran' ke saath hi saath "ramyanirmaan' main bhi nipun thi; tabhi to beete hue kaal ko "pratyaksh' banane main use saras safalataa mili he
 He has made an elegant effort to escape the 'wicked Vaidushya' and made a conscious use of his talent by bowing to the innate pride of "kavikarma"
 itihaas or kavy ke sangam par usne apane "prabandh' ko shant ras kaa "murdhabhishek' diya he or apane pathaakon ko rajtarangini kii amand rasadhara kaa aswadan karne ko aamantrit kiya he
 The truth is that Kalhan has given a new genre to Indian literature by making "history" the subject of poetry and has touched the depths of human nature along with the vast expansion of national life
 shant ras ke aseem parawar main shringaar, vir, raudra, adbhut, vibhats or karun aadi sabhi ras hiloren lete dikhaae gaye hai; or bich-bich main hasya or vyang ke jo chhite udate rahete hai ve bhi bahut mahatvapurn hai
 After Kshemendra, only Kalhan has given a chance to fulfill a huge shortage of Sanskrit literature by tightening satire on contemporary society
 itihaaskaar ke naate ni:andeh kalhan kii apni seemayen hai, visheshkar praarambhik vanshawaliyon or kalganana ke bare main
 His means were also limited
 par khed kii baat he ki apni vivashtaa se satark rahane ke bajaae usne kuch lokprachlit andhvishwaason ko atyuktiyukt manyata di, jaise ranaditya ke 300 varsh lambey shashan kii uphasya anushruti ko
 But it is also no less commendable that from the last part of the fourth wave till its time i
e
 from 3886 cosmic doubt to 4225 flame doubt, its census and history material is detailed and reliable
 apane purvavarti "suriyon' ke 11 granthon or "nilamat' ke atirikt usne pracheen raajaaon ke "pratishthashasan', "vaastushasan', "prashastipatt', "shaastra', bhagnavshesh, sikke or lokshruti aadi puratathvik sadhano se yathesht laabh uthaane kaa gaveshnatmak prayaas kiya he; or sabase badi baat yah ki apane yug kii avasthaaon or vyavasthaaon kaa nikat se adhyayan karte hue bhi vah apni tikaa tippanee main belaag he
 Moreover, in his depiction of his patron Maharaj Jai Singh, he has also introduced unique neutrality
 usee ke shabdon main "purvaparanusndhan' or "anirshya vivek' ke bina gundosh kaa nirnay samichin nahin ho saktaa
 Possibly, this is why Kalhan has not only drawn the political framework, but also presented the glimpses of the social and cultural environment; And Saras has used discretion in the characterization
 maatrugupta or pravarasen, narendraprabha or pratapaditya tathaa anangalekha, khankh or durlbhavardhan athwa chandrapid or chamaar ke prasangon main maanav manovigyaan ke manoram chitra jhilamilaate hai
 Apart from this, there are also indicative signs of bright progress of human nature and sickening tendencies in floods, fires, famines and epidemics etc
 and religious, social and cultural disturbances
 kalhan kaa drushthikon bahut udaar tha; maheshwar hote hue bhi usne buddha darshan kii udaatt paramparaon ko saraahaa he or paakhandee tantrikon ko aade haathon liya he
 Like a true patriot, he has veiled the evils of his countrymen and, like a true gentleman, risen above the boundaries of the country, greeting and rendering Satya, Shiva and Sundar
 samooche pracheen bhartiya itihaas main jo ek maatr vaigyanik itihaas prastut karne kaa praytn hua he vah he kalhan kii rajtarangini
 Despite some of his weaknesses, Kalhan's outlook is often similar to that of today's historian
 swayan to vah samasamyik sthaneey purvagrahon ke upar uth hi gaya he, saath hi ghatnaon ke varnan main atyant samichin anupaat rakhaa he
 The brevity of the description is commendable

 Is such a disgust towards the king a normal thing? aadi-dravid bhashaa dravidiyan bhashaaon kaa aadi rup tha
 Adi languages are, by definition, envisaged languages, which have been reconstructed by linguists and hence historical records of any accustomed language are not available
 proto-dravidiyan ke maamle main bhi kuch aisa hi he
 Due to the lack of comparative linguistic research in Dravidian languages, more details about the grammar, era, or place of proto-dravidian are not known
 aisa mana jaataa he ki 500 isa purv ke aas paas proto-uttari dravidiyan, proto-kendriya dravidiyan or proto-dakshini dravidiyan ke bich vibhedan hua
 However some linguists argue that the degree of differentiation between its subclasses indicates an early division
 vid shabd vigyaan kaa shabd kosh sabhi dravid bhashaaon kii ekmaatr pustak he, isamen proto-dravidiyan shabdon kii ek suchi he, jinke bare main isse zyada koi spashtikaran uplabdh nahin he; isliye ek pratibhashali bhashavid ke liye proto-dravidiyan kaaphi sambhaavnaaen prastut karti he
 Here we will discuss the intuitive features of the reconstructed proto-dravidian language
 swar : proto dravidiyan main paanch laghu or paanch deergh swar hai: *a, *ā, *i, *ī, *u, *ū, *e, *ē, *o, *ō 
 anukram *ai or *au ko *ay or *av mana jaataa he
 Cuisine: Proto Dravidian is reconstructed with the following consonants: vatsarya band dhwani*ṯ kai putree bhashaaon main vatsarya tril ke rup main viksit hota he
 The / r / off sound is still found in Kota and Toda
 The original closed sound is still found in repetition in Malayalam
 Old Tamil has a clearly pronounced vowel like other closed sounds
 anya shabdon main, *ṯ bina spasht swar ke antim shabd ke rup main viksit nahin hui 
 The rhinoceros nasal developed in * ṅ Proto Dravidian before * k
 Hence it is not considered a distinct pronunciation in the Adya Dravidian
 haalanki, mul anukram *ṅk se *ṅ ke sarleekaran ke kaaran malayalam, gondi, konda or pengo bhashaaon main iske uccharan kii sthiti abhi bhi bani hui he

 Dravidian languages have been found mainly in southern India since the beginning of the Common Era

 The similarity of Dravidian languages with Brahui, a language spoken in Balochistan, Pakistan — which was once a part of the Indus Valley — is evident
 iravatham mahadevan jinhen tamil or sanskrit donon bhashaaon kaa gyaan he, ne kai dashakon tak ivisi lipi par adhyayan kiya, unhone 1998 main ek saakshaatkaar main kaha ki ivisi lipi kaa arth ab tak spasht nahin hua he
 According to Michael Vitzel, there are not many Dravidian words even in the early stages of the Vedas, even it can be said that the influence of the Dravidians increased rapidly in the post-rigvedic period
 Professor Vitzel in the essay "substrate Languages in Old indo-aryan" states, "because we cannot recognize the Dravidian influence on early rvs, it means that the language of the pre-rigvedic Indus civilization, at least in the punjab-austro- It was of Asiatic nature
 vitazel rugveda main koi purna austro-aciatic shabd dekh na sakaa or uski pathan shastreey vaadon se nahin kiya gaya he

 Although the advocacy of the apocalyptic part of any religion falls in the field of 'apologetics', but in the religious literature tradition the term has been used only in support of Catholic principles

 Since it is known from Tibetan historical sources that Shantarakshita's life was mid-8th century, and Haribhadra Pal was a contemporary of King Dharmapala, it appears that Sarhapada's life must have been late 8th or early 9th century

 This is the one Kalpasutra, whose complete Kalp-tradition with Shrouta, Griha, Dharma and Shulbasutra is available; But whether all of them have the same factor is difficult to say
 mahamahopadyay pandurang vaaman kane ke matanusaar grihyasutra or dharmasutra in donon ke praneta ek hi hai
 Smritichandrika considers both of them to be a masterpiece

 The formulas obtainable in this are lax and obscure and their style appears to be close to the style of Brahmins
 aapstamb dharmasutra ke samay vishay main buhler kaa kathan he ki iskaa samay isa se 150–200 varsh yaa isse bhi purv maananaa uchit he, kintu mahamahopadyay kane ne 700–300 i

 * It is clear from this that Mimamsa Shastra was fully developed during the time of Apastamb
 aapstamb dharmasutra main dharm kii vyakhya ke antargat pratham vivechy vishay varna hi he
