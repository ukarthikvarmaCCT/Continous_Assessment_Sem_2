 i believe that there is nothing wrong in the Gita
 iske alaava gita vedon ke khilaaf nahin he
 There is no other scriptural evidence except the Vedas - to propagate this truth, Swamiji started visiting the whole country and wherever he went, the pandits and scholars of the ancient tradition gave up on him
 sanskrit bhashaa kaa unhen agaadh gyaan tha
 He was fluent in Sanskrit
 saath hi ve prachand taarkik the
 He studied the Christian and Muslim scriptures thoroughly
 atev akele hi unhone teen-teen morchon par sangharsh aarambh kar diya

 dayanand ne buddhivaad kii jo mashaal jalaayee thi, uskaa koi jawaab nahin tha
 Neither Muslims nor Christians, nor Hindu scholars and scholars who follow the Puranas could answer what they were saying

 Swamiji strongly contradicted the evils prevalent in the prevailing religions, whether it was Sanatan Dharma or Islam or Christianity

 Unlike his contemporary reformers, Swamiji's opinion was not limited to the educated class but the Arya Samaj also attracted the ordinary masses of Aryavarta

 But this society was a Mumbai version of Brahmo society

 Swamiji came to Indraprastha after returning from Mumbai

 Very few people are aware of his remarkable role in the efforts made for national independence
 vastusthiti yah he ki paradheen aryaavart main yah kehane kaa saahas sambhavat: sarvapratham swami dayanand saraswati ne hi kiya tha ki "aryaavart, aryavartiyon kaa he"
 The entire plan of our First Independence Summer, 1857 revolution was also prepared under Swamiji's leadership and he was also its principal architect
 ve apane pravachanon main shrotaaon ko praaia: rashtrawaad kaa upadesh dete or desh ke liye mar mitane kii bhaavana bharte the
 In 1855, when the Kumbh Mela was held in Haridwar, Swamiji traveled from Abu Mountains to Haridwar to join it
 raste main unhone sthaan-sthaan par pravachan kiye tathaa deshavaasiyon kii nabj tatoli
 He realized that people are now fed up with the tyrannical rule of the British and are eager to fight for the independence of the country
 swami dayanand saraswati ne haridwar pahunch kar vahaan ek pahari ke ekaant sthaan par apana deraa jamaaya
 While there, he met five such people who later became the masters of the revolution of 1857
 ye paanch vyakti the naanaa sahib, ajimullah khan, bala sahab, tathya tope tathaa babu kunwar singh
 The negotiations went on for a long time and it was here that it was decided to prepare the ground for armed revolution against the Firangi government and then on a certain day, the trumpet of revolution would be played together in the whole country
 jansadharan tathaa aryavartiya sainikon main is kranti kii aawaaj ko pahunchane ke liye 'roti tathaa camel' kii bhi yojana yaheen taiyaar kii gai

 After his departure, Swamiji established contact with some of his trusted ascetics and formed a secret organization
 is sanghathan kaa mukhyalay indraprastha main mahrauli sthit yogamaya mandir main banaaya gaya
 This headquarters played a notable role in the freedom struggle
 swami ji ke netritv main saadhuon ne bhi sampoorn desh main kranti kaa alakh jagaaya
 He used to carry the messages of revolutionaries from one place to another, encouraging them and if necessary, he himself would take up arms and fight with the British
 san 1857 kii kranti kii sampoorn avadhi main rashtriya netaa, swami dayanand saraswati ke nirantar sampark main rahe
 Even Swami was not disappointed at the failure of freedom struggle
 unhen to is baat kaa pehle se hi abhas tha ki keval ek baar praytn karne se hi swatantrata praapt nahin ho sakati
 For this, a long process of struggle will have to be carried out
 haridwar main hi 1855 kii baithak main babu kunwar singh ne jab apane is sangharsh main safalataa kii sambhaavna ke bare main swami ji se poocha to unka bebaak uttar tha "swatantrata sangharsh kabhi asafal nahin hota
 India has gradually become a revolution in a hundred years
 ab isko swatantra hone main bhi ek sau varsh lag jaaenge
 Many precious lives will be sacrificed in the attainment of this freedom
 " swami ji kii yah bhavishyavaanee kitni sahi nikali, ise baad kii ghatnaon ne pramanit kar diya
 After the failure of freedom struggle, when Tatya Tope, Nana Saheb and other national leaders met Swamiji, he also advised them not to get discouraged and wait for the right time
 1857 kii kranti ke do varsh baad swami ji ne swami virajanand ko apana guru banaaya or unase diksha lee
 Staying in Swami Virjanand's ashram, he studied the Vedas, meditated on them and after that, according to the instructions of his Guru, he started propagating Vedic knowledge
 isi uddeshy kii prapti ke liye unhone arya samaaj kii bhi sthapana kii or uske madhyam se samaaj-sudhaar ke anek kaary kiye
 He campaigned strongly against untouchability, sati, child marriage, male sacrifice, religious parochialism and superstitions and he supported widow marriage, religious generosity and mutual brotherhood
 in sabake saath swami ji logon main deshbhakti kii bhaavana bharne se bhi kabhi nahin chookte the
 In the beginning, many people put various obstacles in Swami ji's social reform work and opposed them
 dhire-dhire unke tark logon kii samaj main aane lage or virodh kam hua
 His popularity continued to grow
 isse angrej adhikariyon ke man main yah ichha uthi ki agar inhen angreji sarkaar ke paksh main kar liya jaae to sahaj hi unke madhyam se jansadharan main angrejon ko lokapriy banaaya ja saktaa he
 Earlier, the British officers had likewise joined some other sermons and religious officials by giving different kinds of temptation
 unhone swami dayanand saraswati ko bhi unheen ke samaan samajha
 Accordingly, Swamiji was met through the then Governor General Lord Northbrook through a Christian priest
 yah mulaakaat march 1873 main kalakatta main hui
 After some formal talk here and there, Lord Northbrook humbly put his point before Swamiji - "in the beginning of your lecture, you will be able to pray for the welfare of the English government in the God you pray
 " Swami ji readily understood everything by listening to the Governor General
 unhen angreji sarkaar kii buddhi par taras bhi aayaa, jo unhen thik tarah nahin samaj saki
 He boldly and firmly replied to the Governor General- governor general ko swami ji se is prakaar ke tikhe uttar kii aashaa nahin thi
 The meeting was terminated immediately and Swamiji returned from there
 iske uparant sarkaar ke guptchar vibhaag kii swami ji par tathaa unki sanstha arya-samaaj par gahari drushti rahi
 Records of each of his movements and every word he spoke began to be kept
 aam janata par unke prabhaav se sarkaar ko ahsaas hone laga ki yah baagi fakir or aryasamaj kisi bhi din sarkaar ke liye khatra ban sakate hai
 Therefore, various types of conspiracies were started to eliminate Swamiji
 swami ji kii mrityu jin paristhitiyon main hui, usase bhi yahi abhas miltaa he ki usamen nishchit hi agreji sarkaar kaa koi shadyantr tha
 Swami ji died on October 30, 1883, at dusk on the day of Deepawali
 un dinon ve jodhpur naresh maharaj jaswant singh ke nimantran par jodhpur gayi hue the
 His frequent discourses were there
 yadakada maharaj jaswant singh bhi unke charnon main baithkar vahaan unke pravachan sunate
 Two or four times Swamiji also went to the state palaces
 vahaan par unhone nanheen naamak veshya kaa anaavashyak hastkshep or maharaj jaswant singh par uskaa atyadhik prabhaav dekha
 Swamiji felt it very bad
 unhone maharaj ko is bare main samajhaayaa to unhone vinamrata se unki baat sweekaar kar lee or nanheen se sambandh tod liye
 This led to a lot of opposition against the little Swamiji
 usne swami ji ke rasoie kaliya urf jagannatha ko apni taraf mila kar unke doodh main pisa hua kaanch dalava diya
 Shortly afterwards Swami came to confess his crime and apologized for it
 udaar-hriday swami ji ne use raah-kharch or jivan-yaapan ke liye paanch sau rupye dekar vahaan se vidaa kar diya taaki police use pareshaan na kare
 Later, when Swamiji was admitted to the hospital in Jodhpur, the concerned doctor also remained under suspicion
 us par aarope tha ki vah aushadhi ke naam par swami ji ko halkaa vish pilaataa rahaa
 Later, when Swamiji's health started deteriorating, he was brought to the hospital in Ajmer
 magar tab tak kaaphi vilamb ho chukaa tha
 Swamiji could not be saved
 is sampoorn ghatnakram main ashanka yahi he ki veshya ko ubhaarne tathaa chikitsak ko bargalane kaa kaary angreji sarkaar ke ishaare par kisi angrej adhikari ne hi kiya
 Otherwise it was not possible for an ordinary prostitute to do such a conspiracy against a well-known and popular person like Swami Dayanand Saraswati only on his own
 bina kisi protsaahan or sangrakshan ke chikitsak bhi aisa dussahas nahin kar saktaa tha
 The body of Swami Dayanand ji, the pioneer of Swadharma, Swabhasa, Swarashtra, self-culture and indigenous promotion, merged into Panchatatva on the day of Diwali in 1883 and he left behind a principle, Krishnamanto Vishwamaryam - that is, make the whole world the best human
 unke antim shabd the - "prabhu! tuune acchhee lila kii
 May your wish be fulfilled
 " Swami Dayanand Saraswati wrote many religious and social books during his lifetime

 bacteria janit mastishk fever main, bacteria do mukhya margon se mastishk aavaran tak pahunchataa he: rakt pravaah dwaara yaa mastishk aavaran ke saath nesal cavity yaa twachaa ke sidhe sampark dwaara
 In most cases, meningitis attacks the mucous surfaces such as the nasal cavity through the bloodstream through living organisms
 yah aksar virus dwaara hone vaale sankramanon ke baad hota he jo shleshm sataha dwaara pradaan kiye jane vaali baadha ko tod detaa he
 Once bacteria are involved in the bloodstream, the subarachnoid enters the space in places where the blood â brain barrier is weak â such as the choroid plexus

 When the components of bacterial infected cell membranes are identified by the immune cells of the brain, they react by releasing large amounts of hormone-like cytokine that employ other immune cells and provoke other tissues to participate in the immune response
 
 rakt-mastishk baadha pargamya ho jaati he, jiske kaaran "vaisogenic" cerebraille edima ho jaataa he
 Large amounts of white blood cells enter the CSF, causing inflammation of the brain lining and causing "interstitial" edema
 iske atirikt, rakt keshikaon kii deevaaren apane aap sooj jaati he, jisase rakt kaa pravaah kam ho jaataa he or ek tisare tarah kaa edima "cytotoxic" edima ho jaataa he
 All three types of cerebral edema cause increased intracranial pressure; With which, severe infection also suffers from decreased blood pressure, which means that it becomes difficult for the blood to enter the brain, as a result of which the brain cells lack oxygen and enter the apatosis stage
 manyata yah he ki antibiotics upar bataayi gayi prakriya ko, bacteria sambandhit koshika jhilli utpaadon kii maatra ko badha kar, shuruyaat main or kharaab kar saktaa he
 Specific treatments such as the use of corticosteroids are targeted at discouraging the immune system's response to this type of event
 mastishk fever se peedit kisi vyakti main, rakt pareekshan un chihnon kaa pataa lagane ke liye kiye jate hai jo vruddhi or rakt cultureki jaankaree dete hai
 The most important test to identify meningitis is the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture
 halanki lumber panchar tab pratidisht ho jaataa he jab mastishk main koi pind upasthit ho yaa antahkapaly dabaav badha hua ho kyonki iske kaaran mastishk herniation hone kii sambhaavna hoti he
 If a person has a nodal or enlarged ICP, a CT or MRI scan is recommended before a lumbar puncture
 yah sabhi vayask maamalon ke 45% maamalon par lagu hota he
 If a CT or MRI is required before LP or if LP proves difficult, professional guidelines suggest antibiotics should be given to delay treatment, especially if it is more than 30 minutes
 aksar CT yaa MRI scan, baad kii avasthaa main kiye jate hai jisase ki mastishk fever kii jatiltaaon kaa aankalan kiya ja sake
 Blood electrolytes may be important in severe forms of meningitis; for example hypnotemia is a common bacterial meningitis due to a combination of several factors including dehydration, improper excretion of antidiuretic hormone, or additional active intravenous fluid administration
 aam taur par ek vyakti ko ek karavat main lita kar, cerebral taral ekatra karne ke liye local anaesthesia laga kar or dural sac main ek sui daal kar lumber panchar kiya jaataa he
 When this is achieved, csf's "opening pressure" is measured using a manometer
 daab aam taur par 6 or 18 cm jal ke bich hota he; bacteria janit mastishk fever main daab aam taur par badha hota he
 In cryptococcal meningitis, there is a significant increase in intracranial pressure
 taral kaa aarambhik swaroop sankraman kii prakruti kaa sanket sabit ho saktaa he: dhundhala CSF sanket karata he ki protein, safed va laal rakt koshikaon or / yaa bacteria kaa str ooncha he or isaliye isamen bacteria janit mastishk fever ho saktaa he
 CSF samples are tested for the presence and type of white blood cells, red blood cells, protein content and glucose levels
 namoonay kii gram staning bacteria janit mastishk fever main bacteria pradarshit kar saktaa he, lekin bacteria kii anupasthiti bacteria janit mastishk fever kii sambhaavna ko nishkasit nahin karti he kyonki ve sirf 60% maamalon main dikhte hai; yadi namoona liye jane ke pehle antibiotics diye gayi the to yah aankada 20% tak or kam ho jaataa he
 Gram staining is also less reliable in infections such as listeriosis
 microbiological culture kaa namoona adhik samvedansheel hota he lekin parinaam uplabdh hone main 48 ghante tak kaa samay lagata he
 The more present type of blood cells indicate whether meningitis is bacterial or virus-induced, although it is not always a reliable indicator at the onset of the disease
 kam saamaanya maamalon main snophil prabalata duusare kaarnon ke saath paraseete yaa funfoond ke kaaran hone kaa suzav detii he
 Excess of glucose in CSF is generally 40% higher than in blood
 bacteria janit mastishk fever main yah aam taur par kam hoti he; CSF kaa glucose str is kaaran rakt sharkara se vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 a ratio of â¤0
4 may indicate bacterial meningitis; Glucose levels in CSF in neonates are generally high and a ratio below 0
6 is considered abnormal
 CSF main lactate bacteria janit mastishk fever ke hone kii sambhaavna ke ucch str ko darshata he, thik aise hi shwet rakt koshikaon kii ucch sankhya bhi
 If the lactate levels are less than 35 mg / dl and the person has not taken any antibiotics before, this reduces the likelihood of bacterial meningitis
 mastishk jwaron ke vibhinn prakaar kii pruthak pahchaan karne ke liye anya vishesh pareekshan upyog kiye ja sakate hai
 The latex agglutination test may be positive in meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilis influenzae, Escherichia coli and Group b streptococci; Regular use of this is not encouraged because it causes very little change in treatment but can be used when other tests are unable to diagnose
 isi prakaar limulus liset pareekshan gram-nakaaratmak bacteria janit mastishk fever main sakaaratmak ho saktaa he, lekin yah tab tak simit rup se upyogi hota he jab tak ki anya pareekshan sahaayak na rahe ho
 Polymerase chain reaction is a technique used to amplify small traces of bacterial DNA to identify the presence of bacterial or virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid; It is a high-sensitivity and specific test because it requires the amount of DNA traces of the infecting agent
 yah bacteria janit mastishk fever main bacteria kii pahchaan kar saktaa he or virus janit mastishk fever ke vibhinn maamalon main antar pataa karne ke liye sahaayak ho saktaa he
 Serology may be useful in viral meningitis
 yadi tubarkalos mastishk fever kaa andeh ho to, namoonay ko zeel nelson stenjiski samvedansheeltaa nimna he or tuberculosis culture, jisamen adhik samay lagata he; PCR kaa upyog bad rahaa he
 Cryptococcal meningitis can be diagnosed at low cost using the Indian Ink stain on CSF; However, testing for cryptococcal antigens in blood or CSF is more sensitive, especially in people with AIDS
 jahaan par antibiotics lene ke baad mastishk fever ke lakshan hote hai, "aanshik rup se upachaarit mastishk fever", ek nidanatmak va upachaaratmak kathinaayee he
 When this happens, CSF findings may resemble those of viral meningitis, but antibiotic treatment needs to be continued as long as definite symptoms of the virus cause
 mastishk fever kaa nidaan mrityu ke baad ho saktaa he
 Post-mortem findings typically indicate an increased inflammation of the arachnoid, the layers of the mater and the brain covering
 neutrophil granulokite, craniel nerve or ridh ke saath cerebrospinal taral or mastishk ke aadhaar kii ore bad jate hai, jo ki pas dwaara ghire ho sakate hai â isi prakaar maningiel keshikaayen bhi
 For some causes of meningitis, protection may be provided through long-term vaccination or in the short term by antibiotics
 kuch vyavhaar janit upaay bhi prabhavi ho sakate hai
 Bacterial and virus-induced meningitis is contagious, although neither is as contagious as common colds or flu
 chumban, chhikane yaa kisi ke khansane se hone vaale shwasan srav se nikali buundon ke madhyam se dono rogon kaa sankraman ho saktaa he lekin mastishk fever se peedit vyakti dwaara chodi gayi hawa ke madhyam se aisa nahin ho saktaa he

 Its two methods are prevalent - universal, that is, by applying it to the palms and soles, and by applying it to the localized, diseased part

 This firm rule applies only to the universal use of magnets, while in the case of endemic use, more attention is given to disease infection, pain, swelling etc
 uttam parinaam hasil karne ke liye jab rog athwa uskaa prasar sharir ke upree bhaag arthath naabhi se upar ho to chumbakon ko hatheliyon par lagaaya jaataa he, jabaki sharir ke nichle bhaagon arthath naabhi se neeche vidyaman rogon main chumbakon ko talvon main lagaaya jaataa he
 In this, magnets are placed in places that are diseased, such as the knees and feet, painful vertebrae, eyes, nose, etc

 To get the best results, when the disease or its spread is above the upper part of the body ie the navel, the magnets are applied to the palms, while in the diseases of lower parts of the body, ie below the navel, the magnets are applied to the soles
 is prayog vidhi main chumbakon ko un sthanon par lagaaya jaataa he, jo rogagrast hote hai, jaise- ghutana or pair, dardanaak kasheruka, aankh, naak aadi
 According to the intensity and form of the disease, one, two and even three magnets can be used
 udaahranarth- ghutane tathaa gardan ke tej dard main do chumbakon ko alag-alag ghutanon par tathaa tisare chumbak ko gardan kii dardanaak kasheruka par lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The method of this experiment is also useful in the case of endemic disease infection
 anguthe main tej dard hone jaisi kuch avasthaaon main kabhi-kabhi donon chumbakon ke dhruvon ke bich angutha rakhane se turant aaraam miltaa he
 It is beneficial for males and females of all ages
 chumbakon ke madhyam se ilaaj itnaa sidhaa-sada he ki yah kisi bhi samay, kisi bhi sthaan par or sharir ke kisi bhi ang par aajamaaya ja saktaa he
 Men or women, young or old, all can benefit from it

 Whether the pain is due to any reason, the magnet has the virtue of reducing it, rather than ending it

 For this reason, magnets have an effect on all diseases, pain goes away and disorders of body functions are cured
 chumbak kaa aakaar or dizin is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki use sharir ke kis bhaag par lagaana he
 There are some parts of the body, where large size magnets cannot be installed, small magnets will not work properly on some parts
 udhaaharan ke liye agar aankh par chumbak lagaana ho to chote aakaar kaa gol chumbak hona chahie, jo band aankh ke upar aa jaae
 On the other hand, if there is pain or swelling in most parts of the body, then a large size magnet will be applied
 isliye ek hi aakaar-prakaar ke chumbak kaa prayog sharir ke vibhinn bhaagon par nahin ho saktaa
 The same thing applies to the power of magnets
 sharir ke kuch komal ang jaise mastishk, aankh or hriday jahaan adhik shakti vaale chumbak nahin lagane chahie or na madhyam shakti ke chumbak adhik der tak lagane chahie
 Conversely, low-power magnets will not suffice for diseases of stiff and large muscles or bones, such as those of the hips, thighs, knees, or ankles
 na keval sthaneey rogon, balki saare sharir ke liye chumbakon ke chunaav main in baton kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 It is necessary that the patient does not have contact with the ground or any iron item while taking treatment
 atah lohe kii kursi yaa palang varjit he, jabaki lakdi kii kursi yaa palang adarsh he
 The position of the magnets should be such that the North Pole is towards North and South Pole should be towards South
 isse chumbak kaa kshetra prithvi ke chumbakeey kshetra ke samanaantar rahegaa or chumbak adhik prabhaavshaalee banenge
 If two different poles of two magnets are being used at the same time, then the patient should face towards the west, so that the right part of his body is towards the north and the left side is towards the south
 aisa upyukt mana gaya he ki chumbakon kaa sthanik athwa sarvadaihik prayog 10 minute se 30 minute tak samichin rahata he
 For chronic rheumatoid arthritis in adults, the use of magnets for the first one week should be only for 10 minutes and this period should be gradually increased to 30 minutes
 anya kai rogavasthaon main bhi tadnusaar samay badhaayaa janaa chahie
 The more powerful magnets should be reduced accordingly
 jab mastishk jaise komalangon par chumbak kaa prayog karnaa ho, to yah acchhee tarah samaj len ki isamen shaktishaalee chumbak nahin lagaae jate
 Magnet should never be used for more than 10 minutes

 In the year 1952, British engineer Sir Christopher Cockerell, experimenting with the motor of a vacuum cleaner and two small cylindrical compartments, proved for the first time that a vehicle with an air cushion hurled air through an engine

 Tapasya tapa originally meant light or ignition which was evident in the sun or fire
 kintu dhire-dhire uskaa ek roodharth viksit ho gaya or kisi uddeshy vishesh kii prapti athwa atmik or shaareerik anushaasan ke liye uthaae janevaale daihik ksht ko tap kaha jane laga
 In fact, the development of the spirit of asceticism was the result of the development of the doctrine of the four Purusartho and the four Ashramas
 ye sabhi vichaar uttar vaidic yug kii hi dein hai or yadi rugveda main tapas kaa koi vishesh ullekh na mili to isamen aashcharya nahin
 Yes, that form of tapas, which is tantric and guhyak and whose purpose is to harm another or to protect oneself from the attack of another, the Shudra must be affected by the non-aryan elements
 mulat: moksh kii prapti kaa icchhuk sanyasi hi tapascharya main rat hua
 His discussions begin in Brahmins and Upanishads and attainment of Brahm becomes his objective
 sarvaswatyag uske liye aavashyak mana gaya or yah samajha jane laga ki sansar main avaagaman ke bandhanon se mukt hone ke liye vairaygy hi nahin naitik jivan bhi aavashyak he
 Therefore, not only the renunciation of all the comforts of life, the body also started burning or tormenting it in many ways
 kuch videshi vidvan tapasya main nihit vichaaron ko arya or vaidic na maanakar avaidic adivaasiyon kii dein maanate hai
 But this does not seem right
 anarya or avaidic tatv dhire-dhire vaidic samaaj ke shudra varg main samahit ho gaye, jinhen tapasya kaa adhikaar pracheen dharm or samaaj ke netaaon ne diya hi nahin
 Even ascetic Shudras like Shambuk, who were doing the opposite, were punished
 yadi tapas kii vichaardhaara kaa prarambh un anarya tatwon se hua hota to yah paristhiti asambhav hoti
 a variety of forms and forms of austerity were considered due to differences in motives
 vidyadhyaayi brahmacharee, putrakalatra, dhansampatti tathaa aihik sukhon ke icchhuk grihasth, paramatma kii prapti, brahm se leen or mokshalabh kii ichha se prerit sanyasi manobhilashit var athwa stri chaahanewaale vyakti, bhagwaan main leen bhakt evam devidevataaon kii krupa chaahanewaale sarsaadhaaran stripurush, swadharm or saadhaaran dharm kaa paalan karne vaale saadhaaran jan aadi anek prakaar ke log bhinn bhinn roopon main tapas kaa sinddhant maanate or uskaa prayog karte
 The center of asceticism was to torment the body
 uske jitne hi bahuvidh rup hue athwa kathorta badi, tapas kaa utana hi charmotkarsh mana gaya
 The ordinary ascetic was limited only to the practice of vatkÄlÄdÄ ,Ä, bhÄtÄ«à¥à¤¯à¤¾Äya, snacking, jÄtÄgÄdÄ, à¤¨a, nÄ ,hÄdhÄ à¤µà¥a, vedocharan, yajnÄkÄvikÄ à¤à¤°a, and kindness, but in the hot summer heat, panchagni, revelation in the rain, jalÄnivÄsa in winter, or living in wet clothes, Three times bathing, Kandamulashan, begging, abstaining from the habitation and giving up all the comforts of the body and giving it trouble, is a symptom of penance Did not know shiv ko praapt karne ke liye parvati kii tapasya iskaa pramukh udhaaharan he
 Not only this, with one posture, namely - holding hands, walking or wearing other metaphors of the same kind - maintaining it for a few days or a lifetime, Tama's climax started to be considered
 aaj bhi aise anek tapasvi or hathyogi bharatvarsh ke sabhi konon, visheshat: tirthon, ashramon, nadi ke kinaaron or parvaton kii kandaraon main milenge
 The general public and sometimes the intelligent but also faithful and respectable society, have been respecting such ascetics and have also believed in emanating any superhuman or spiritual power
 kintu samalochak buddhi se yukt buddhijivi varg ne usapar kitni aasthaa rakhi he yah kah sakna kathin he
 The people of Western countries recognize that the Pauravayas have an infinite capacity to absorb suffering and physical heat and try to rise above or avoid it by torturing themselves in retaliation for subjugation, material tyranny and injustice
 shopenhaar ke man se isi kaaran purv ke deshon main ek nirashavad or dukhwad kaa janm hua, jiske parilakshan the sansar kaa tyaag, sanyas, sadhu jivan, sharir ko ksht dena or ichchhaaon ke daman kii aprakritik or amanovaigyanik pravriti
 But it seems that these thinkers do not pay as much attention to the prophetic psychological and pure physical analysis behind the accomplishment of meaning in the goals of Indian life, as in the sense of self-reliant salvation and its attainment
 isi drushti se tap kaa jo saamaajik vishleshan manusmriti main miltaa he vah chintya he
 Accordingly, the tenacity theology of the Chaturvarnayas is prescribed by their karma, such as the attainment of knowledge through Brahman, the protection of society through Kshatriya, agriculture, cow protection and commerce through Vaishya and service of the two-nation through Shudra
 saamaajik dashti se yah swadharm- apane kartavyon kaa paalan - hi sabamein mahatvapurn tap tha
 In the Bhagavad Gita, the philosophical aspect of asceticism and asceticism is seen as the best and its physical, speech and mental and satvic, majestic and tamasic forms are described
 shaareerik tap dev, dwij, guru or ahimsa main nihit hota he, vaachik tap anudvegkar vaani, satya or priybhaashan tathaa swadhyay se hota he or maansik tap man kii prasannataa, saumyata, aatmanigrah or bhavasanshuddhi se siddh hota he
 Along with this, there is a perfect sattvik which is done devotionally with the desire of fruit
 iske vipareet satkar, maan or puja ke liye dambhpurvak kiya janevaala rajas tap athwa mudhatavash apane ko anek ksht dekar duusare ko ksht pahunchaane ke liye jo bhi tap kiya jaataa he, vah adarsh nahin
 It is clear that in Indian asceticism, attainment of eternal values of life has been given the highest position and Nishkam Karma is considered to be its greatest path

 Similarly, a situation occurs twice a year when the earth is neither inclined towards the sun nor the other side of the sun, but in the middle
 is sthiti ko vishuv yaa equinox kaha jaataa he
 On both these dates, the length of day and night are almost equal
 yadi do log bumadhya rekha se samaan duuri par khadey hon to unhen din or raat kii lambaai baraabar mahasoos hogi
 At the beginning of the Gregorian year, the sun is in the southern hemisphere and from there the northern hemisphere

 In view of this definition in relation to the rise and setting or orbiting of the Sun on the Earth, equinox is the time in the orbit of a planet, in which the Sun in the orbit and specific position of the planet passes directly above the equator

 At equinox, the sun is directly in the equator
 iskaa arth yah he ki yadi koi vyakti bumadhya rekha par khadaa ho to surya use sidhe apane sir ke upar dikhaai degaa
 It also means that half the planet is fully illuminated and at this time the day and night are almost equal

 Once in the evening, Sayaji Idar Naresh Rao was seated in Kalyanmal Ji's office, suddenly Sayaji became stable and rubbed both hands vigorously
 saanyaji kii is vicitra kriya ko dekh raja sahit sabha achambhit rah gayi
 After some time, Sayaji stopped rubbing his hands and separated both hands, then both hands had turned black and hands had become blisters
 in hatho ko dekhakar raja or praja or zyada achambhit hue
 When Rana ji was unable to do so, he asked Sayaji, what were you doing with a stunned shock that caused your palms to turn black and blisters, please tell us Kaviraj
 tab saanyaji bole he ravji isamen aashcharya kii koi baat nahin, dwarika main shri ranchod raay kii aarti utaarte samay pujari ke haath main pakadi aarti kii baati se gire tinke ke kaaran ranchod raay ke vaagho main aag lag gai to is ghatana se mujh sevak ko drushtigochar hone se donon hatho se ragad kar aag bujhane se mere haath kaale hue or chhaale pade
 If Ranaji did not believe this statement, the next day sent his confidant Rathod Chandaji to Dwarka to find out the truth of this incident
 chandaji ne dwarika pahunchate hi bhagwaan ke darshan kiye or jis kaam se aaye uskaa pataa lagane hetu pujari se mili or poocha ki pujari ji gat margshirsh maas kii sudi gyaras kii shaam ko ranchod raay ji ke mandir main koi ghatana ghati? tab pujari bolaa main to kya puraa shahar jaanata he ki aarti kii baati se gire tinke ke kaaran ranchod raay ko nae dhaaran karwaae kapado main aag lag gai or us aag ko saanyaji ne andar aakar bujhaai thi
 Hearing this, Chandoji said that Sayaji was here that day? Then Guglia Maharaj said, why are you wondering that Sayaji was here that day? Not only that, he is always present here at evening time
 yah baat sunakar chandoji ko or zyada aashcharya hua ki eader kii sabha main baithkar dusre rup main aag bujhaai wo to thik he magar hameshaa yahan hajir hote he yah to nai ghatana hui
 In the evening, it was the time of Aarti, as the sound of the whalers started coming, Chandaji started turning his eyes and staring that today i saw Sayaji, saw Saiyaji holding a gold stick behind the credibility of the door of Dwarkadhish
 aarti puri hui, saanyaji ne sone kii jari dwarkadhish ke saamne rakhi ranchhodji ne apane haath lambey kar jari me se jalpan kiya
 Seeing this direct evidence, Chandoji started believing that Sayaji, sitting in the eider, had extinguished the burning wagons of Thakurji

too much and i don't tell you that i have excavated treasures and neither am i a gab and i say that i am an angel And i do not say to those who are guilty in your eyes that God will not do well with them, i know very well about the hearts of those people and if i say this then i too No one is guilty, those people started saying, "noah, you have feuds and many more quarrels with us, then you are true, then you used to threaten us, but you have to give me noah
 Can't beat him like that and if i want, then i will take care of you
 If God accepts you to be misguided, then nothing can work for me
 Gar and by the Koran that same side you go back to say You have said that if i have fabricated it, then i will bear the burden of my crime and i am the only one who is guilty and i have been sent to Noah that he has been given the faith Now if no one will believe in your religion, then you do not take the pleasure of their dignity and make a cauldron by our rubbish and our orders and about those who have persecuted
 Do not recommend me because these people will surely be drowned and Noah started to make a shirt and whenever the people of his community passed by him, Noah used to be prancing about them, saying that if you are a prankster at this time, the way you Laugh at us, we will laugh at you one time and you will get to know very quickly which one is destined to make him feel angry and one is a dummy azazi nazi It happens even when our order came and started cheering from Tannur We ordered two of every kind of life, take two and take all the people and people who have come to faith and sit in the cauldron in addition to the reality that has already been ordered and few people have faith in them
 And Noah said Bismillah Mazariha Mursaha get on board in Ksheti
 Blessing my family is a big calf and i think that those people were taken in the waves of the mountains
 Is going on and Noah gave voice to his son who was in a cot when he was separated from me, take my gazelle in our shoes and i am not with the infidels, so i still hold the support of a mountain that will save me from water
 Noah said that today there is no one to save himself from the wonders of God, but God is the one who will be rewarded, and suddenly there was a pleasure between the two sons and he was drowned and ordered that the land be Receiving water to absorbing and AI was overcast cease and declining water and work has been all And Ksheti who went to the same place and was told that the oppressed people were away and was going on, then Noah called his family and my God is not in it because my son is involved in my environment and you promised
 Was that i will save your ehl) and it is not that your promise is true and you are a greater prince than all the rulers, God has given you, Noah, he certainly does not join you
 No, it is a cruel illusion Noah has demanded that i take refuge from you in my family to request something that i do not know, and if you are ordered by me, Noah is safe from our side and i am in love with them
 Get down from those who are on you and those who are with you, not some of them and some people who we will deaf after a few days, then from our side they will get painful relief
 Huà¤chega These Chand Khbre of Ghab cause through the same style on your side You are not aware of what he has, nor do you have patience, it is not that the last is for the abstinence and the common man has his brother Hood told him from his community that my work is good for him
 Except you are not your lover, you are just a little iftera, my people do not understand that, and my people ask for blessings from your family and then pray for her If you stop yourself, then it will rain down on you from the sky, the happy sister will not do it and will not increase your poetry even more, and do not turn her face to face as a criminal, people say that you have not come to us with any argument and your By saying this, you are not going to leave your Gods, nor are we going to believe you, we just say that who among our Gods has made you a fool Hki do things Hud Beshk replied i am witness to God and you also witness Be that you make a love of God except God, in this i am a bishop, so all of you crave with me and do not give me any time, i do not care if i only trust God who is my God and my God And all the people who are walking on the ground are on top of it, it is not only that my family is on the straight path but also if you stay away from its command
 i have assured you that i was sent to you by order, and my family will kill you other than you, and you cannot spoil anything in it, it is not that my family is able to observe everything and When our order arrived, we gave Hood and those who had brought with him his kindness and saved us from our strict surprise
 We belong to the man who refused the verses of his family and his Disobey the prophets and keep following the orders of every government and even in this world, curse was put behind them and even on the Day of Judgment, the people refused their family
 See, the people of Hood are lying and the community has He said to his brother-in-law Saleh, "oh my country, i pray you only God, no one is your lover except him
 He created you from the ground and settled you in it Do not ask for blessings from him and then pray for him in the desert and listen to everyone and pray that he says, âsaleh, before that we had our hopes before you, so now what did you expect our father grandfather to do?â We stop you from that and we are lying in such a way that you have surprised us, Saleh replied, Aye my law Well, if i am on the plea of my family and she has given me If i disobey myself, but if i disobey him, then who will help me - then you will not increase anything except for the loss, my demon is a camel of God, there is a chance for you, then leave it to God Eat in the ground and do not hurt him, then you will be taken aback immediately, but those people cut off his brush, then Saleh said, well, for three days, their own d i have the promise of peace that is never false, then when our command came, we saved Saleh and the people who had faith in him from his kindness and saved us from the day's weather, not that it is your family
 It is very ghalib and the people who had been tortured were taken away by a strict Chighad, then they got stuck in their houses and died so that Goya never settled in them
 Mr
 Keep listening not look Khume Thamud the Nafrmani their Lord and were The community has been abused and brought the good news to Ibrahim sent to us and he saluted and replied to the salute
 Then Ibrahim brought a calf to roast
 When he saw that his hands did not move towards him, he was disoriented and He was afraid and said, "you are not scared, we have been sent to the Lot of Lot, and Abraham's wife stood up, she was laughing, so we gave the good news of the birth of Isaac
" After Mr
 and Isaac, she started saying that now i am going to be a child, i am old and my parents are old too
 It is a wonderful thing that the angel said that you wonder about the nature of God
 Bet on you, God bless you and it is not worth it that he is an able-bodied old man
 When the fear of Ibrahim continued and the good news came to him, then we were told by Lot
 Desperate Ibrahim Burdbar was a soft-hearted person who started fighting in Ray Do not shy away from the fact that the order of your family has come and it is not sure that they are going to get such a surprise which cannot be avoided in any way and when our sent angels come to Lot, they are ready to think He became upset with his arrival and started saying that this is a day of severe trouble and his people came running to him and these people used to do bad things for him
 Lot saw him coming and said o my daughters, the daughters of these marriages marry them, they are justified and more clean for you, so do not be afraid of God and do not make me feel good about my guest, are any of you not a wise man? i know very well that we do not have any help with your girls and you know very well what we want, Lot said, i wish i had a fight against you Oti or i could take refuge in a fortified castle, he said Frishte a Lot We These people sent to you by your lover, the promise is just in the morning, is it not so early in the morning, when our command came, we reversed and made the top part of it down and on it we broke the corrugated stones, on which your family was He was a resident of the city and that settlement was not far from the oppressors and we sent his brother Uyab as a prophet to the Madayans
 o Lord, worship me, God is not God except you, and do not make any difference in size and weight, i am looking at you happily and i scare you with the wonder of the day that will surround and Keep my mass and scales full with justice and do not give the people their things and do not spread the ruins in the ground
 If you are a real mom, then the God of your habit Te said good and i do not have Nigehban He said people Ai Yuab Does your namaz teach you that we should leave those whose parents our grandfathers used to do or we can do whatever we want in our goods, you are just a savage and intelligent
 i am on the plea from the side and he has given me a livelihood and i do not want to stop you from doing whatever you want to do against me
 i do not want to become anyone except for you and i cannot believe anyone except myself, i have believed in it and i look forward to it and i do not commit such a crime against you Give the same trouble as Noah or Hood or Saleh were to you, and the same trouble will come upon you, and Lot's work is not far from you and you will ask for blessings from your family
 Don't forget me, my lover is very kind of love and those people Saying Aube, what you say is often not understood by us and it is not that we consider you very weak among our people and if you did not have a tribe, we would have communicated to you and you So we can not be wrong in any way
 Ayub said, my community, is the pressure of my clan greater than you and you have put yourself behind for yourself? The teacher is my family in the courtyard of your house and you do my work in my place, i also do something, you will soon know that the one who is in danger is going to make you angry and who is a liar, you should also be a monkey
 i am also waiting with you and when our order came, we saved Uyib and the people who brought him with his kindness and those who did not Victimization did they put replaced by a scream, then all that all their homes He was left stunned that Goya had never settled in those settlements
 Hear that the same way Madhun was also smitten and unhappy, we sent Moses to Pharaoh and his friend by pleading his blessings and rage
 He obeyed the decree again, although the decree of the revival was not thought out, he would go ahead of his demise on the Day of Judgment and take them to hell and throw them How many people were removed, and the shame was also put behind them and what a bad reward they got even on the Day of Judgment
 These are the conditions of the few settlements that we tell you, the hawk is the one and the hawk Was destroyed and we did not persecute them in any way, but those people persecuted themselves then when the order of your family came, it could not be used They used to call themselves except God, and those Mabuds did nothing but chant Not only did they benefit, but due to their ambition, the wonder came and with the help of the people of the settlements, when your family catches hold in the sky, then its grip is like this, the grip is so painful, it is not that for the person who has the surprise
 i am afraid that there is a sign that this will be the day that all the people will be deposited and this will be the day that all will be present and we are just a Muayyun issue We are delaying it till the day he arrives, then no one can talk to anyone without a command, then some people will be angry with them and some people will be angry and those who are upset will be shocked and Those who cry and scream will always be there as long as they are in the sky and on the ground, but when your family wants, no matter what your family wants, you will do whatever you want
 People are good, they will be in good condition as long as there is sky and land, they are always there
 But when your family wants it, it will be a fortune that will never be desired, then these people do not fall in love with whom you pray
 The portion will be reduced without any reason, and if we have given the book to Moses, then quarrels were put in it and if there was not already any order from your family, it would be in their favor
 The decision would have been assured and these people too are deeply involved in this behalf and it is not only that your family will give a lot of revenge to their people, who are very aware of their misdeeds, as they have commanded you
 You and the people who have been with you, justify your steps and do not do anything, whatever you do is definitely watching and the people who have They have persecuted above, do not have Mael on their side and otherwise even the fire will come to you and Apart from God and people are not even your guardians, then no one will help you and recite the Namaz on both sides of the day and some nights
 The truth is that sins are removed and for those who remember this, they are the advice and dignity and you Be patient because God does not destroy the souls of those who do good things, then why did some people who have passed before you not have such wisdom who have fallen on the ground Prevented the spread of de but very few and they were from the same people whom we rescued from the wonders and those who disobeyed after them and who were given to them and these people were criminals and your family is so Never was it that the settlements would be forcibly destroyed and the people there are noble practices, and if your family wanted it, it would have made all the people unhappy, they did not want this same people
 Esha put forth to one another will, but the mercy of your Lord to Frmaa and so He created those people
 The order of your family is very fulfilled that we will surely fill the soul with all the jinn and men, and in the condition of the prophets, we tell you all those things that we can strengthen your heart
 Will give and in those cases you have also received the advice and remembrance for the right and the promise and tell those who do not believe that you will eat instead Implement, we also do something, you also wait, we are anxious and all the sky and the rich things of the land are special, and every work towards it comes back again and again you pray the same and trust in it And what you guys do is not completely oblivious, but the hood is over We make statements by which we will strengthen your heart and in those cases, you have also received a lot of advice and remembrance for your rights and responsibilities and tell those who do not believe that you do something yourself, we also do something for you

 This theory evolved from the concept of continental displacement, envisaged in the first decade of the twentieth century, when new evidence was discovered in the 1960s that strengthened the concept of continents being dynamic rather than static
 in saakshyon main sabase mahatvapurn hai purachumbakatv se sambandhit sakshya jinase sagar nital prasaran kii pushti hui
 The discovery of Sagar Nittal Varshan by Harry Hayes is believed to be the beginning of the rendering of this theory and scholars like Wilson, Morgan, mckenzie, Oliver, Parker etc
 contributed to its promotion by providing evidence in its favor

 These plates are floating on the semicircular layer of the asthenosphere at the bottom and are generally moving at a speed of about 10â40 mm / yr, although some have a velocity of 160 mm / yr

 In plate tectonics, the word tectonics is derived from the Greek language ÏÎµÎºÏÎ¿Î½Î¹ÎºÏÏ meaning to relate to construction

 According to this theory, the lithosphere, located as the upper layer of the earth, consisting of the crust and some part of the upper mantle, is divided into several pieces called plates

 Apart from this, there are some medium and small size plates

 In the context of mountain construction, two views were first prevalent, by vertical movement and horizontal movement

 The concept was first propagated in Europe by Austrian Edward Swoos
 iske vipareet kuch kaa maananaa tha ki mahadwipon kaa kshaitij sthantharan hua he or inke takaraane se upree sataha main bal pad jane se parvaton kaa nirmaan hua he
 The first challenge to contractionists was when the resolution of horizontal transfers of continents was resolved 
 shuruuaati solahavin sadi main hi vidwaanon ne atlantic mahaasaagar ke donon kinaaron kii ek duusare se samanta ko chihnit kiya tha
 The English philosopher Francis Bacon first marked this resemblance with the study of exact maps, with the cartographer Abraham Ortelius saying in 1596 that the Americas broke apart from Europe and Africa, and the German theologian Theodor Lilienthal's statement of Ortelius in 1756 Attempted to confirm on the basis of a biblical statement

 Wagner was the first to use the term "continental displacement", following the same principle of Wagner that the development of plate tectonics was possible, although his ideas were also rejected by scholars for nearly half a century until evidence was available in the 1960s
 
 or mahadwipiya visthaapan Due to the mobility of the plates, there are three types of edges or borders: is prakaar ke kinaaron ke sahare do platen ek duusare kii ore gati karti hai or takaraakar unamem se baari plate halaki plate ke neeche kshepit hoti he
 This part, which is twisted downward, goes deep and melts and converts into magma due to the excess of heat and pressure
 jis gaharaai par yah ghatana hoti he use kshepan mandal yaa beniof zone kehete hai
 With the help of such edges, due to pressure of the landowners, they turn and form mountains
 neeche jaakar pighla padaarth megma plum ke rup main upar uth kar jwalamukhiyata bhi utpann karata he
 Where two plates move opposite to each other, that is, they move away from each other, magma rises up from the bottom to form a new plate

 Rift valleys are formed when this shore lies on a continent
 nayi plate ke nirmaan ke kaaran ise rachanaatmak kinaaraa bhi kehete hai
 The protective edge is the one with which the two platens are moving, rubbing each other, that is, neither descending nor converging
 saamanytah is kinare ke sahare ek duusare ko ragadate huye vipareet dishaao main gatisheel hoti hai kintu yah anivaary nahin he, yadi do platen ek hi disha main gatisheel hon or unki gati alag-alag ho tab bhi unke kinare ragadate huye sangrakshi kinaaraa bana sakate hai
 Transform faults are found on their support

 Plate tectonics theory offers the newest explanation of the construction of fine mountains
 udhaaharan ke liye alpine parvat tantra ke parvaton kii utpatti kii vyakhya ko prastut kiya ja saktaa he
 According to this theory it is believed that the series of mountains on the northern and southern sides of the Mediterranean Sea are the result of tectonic events in the Tertiary era in which they were formed by compression between the African and European plates of sediments deposited in the Tethys Sea
