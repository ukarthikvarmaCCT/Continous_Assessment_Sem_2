 Some water is mixed into the atmosphere in vapor form, some is pulled from the ground by some vegetation and converted to vapor by exposure to air
 prithvi ke antstal main pravisht jal kaa kuch ansh stroton dwaara prakat hokar nadi, naalon yaa anya neeche sthalon par pravaahit yaa sankalit hone lagata he
 When the amount of water increases greatly due to some reason, then the river, rivulets flow in the form of flood or rise and sometimes cause great damage
 vaise to pani kaa bahaav prakruti ke akatya niyamon ke antargat hota he, kintu prayek sthal kii bhoomi kii ruparekha, vanaspati, abahava or manushya dwaara banaae hue sadhano ke kaaran, pani ke bahaav main bahut parivartan ho jaataa he
 If there is a stop at some place, due to that stop, the velocity of the flow of water is necessary
 isiliye pani kii vegavati dhara ke sampark main badi badi chattaane bhi dhire dhire ghul jaati hai
 For this reason, new land is created from the sand brought by rivers at the mouths of rivers, which is called delta
 vastav main prithvi par bade bade maidan, jaise uttari bharat main ganga or sindhu ke vishaal maidan, himalay se laai hui ret ke bane hue hai
 It would have taken crores of thousands of years in this design

 Many layers of water are also located in the earth's surface
 kahin kahin jal prithvi tal ke sameep miltaa he or kahin par adhik gaharaai main
 Hydrology in this area is related to geology

 Sometimes water enters the womb of the earth and stays there for thousands of years in the same condition
 kuch jalarashi dhire dhire samudr kii ore bhugarbha main pravaahit hoti rahati he
 The progress of hydrology in this direction is very limited
 pravaahit jal kaa maapan bhi jalavigyaan kaa ek vishesh ang he
 It is especially used in hydroelectric, watermill etc
 in the means of land irrigation
 aajkal ke yug main to bahut se kaarkaanon main bhi jal kaa prayog thandak pahunchaane athwa jal dwaara chaalit mashiinon ko chalaane ke liye hota he
 Therefore, it is mandatory to have different types of water treatment methods
 badi nadiyon main jab baadh aati he, us samay jalamaapan ek samasya ban jaataa he, kyonki nadiyon ke tal main ret or mitti bhi jal ke saath bahati chalati he
 By the way, many instruments have been made for the purpose of hydration, such as dharvegometer etc
, instruments are placed in place to measure the water received by the rain, so that it can be estimated that how much water is received by the rain, how much rivers get into the sea It goes on, how much it enters the ground and turns into some vapor

 Its action is dependent on the voyeurism
 hamaari aankh ke krishnapatal par kisi vastu kaa pratibimb vastu ko hataa lene ke lagbhag 1 / 16 second se lekar 1 / 10 second baad tak bana rahata he
 a simple stratoscope consists of a circular letter or circle, in which holes are formed in one or two three circular rows at equal distances near the turn
 vrittakar patr ko ek chaal se ghumaya jaataa he or chhidron ke sameep aankh vrittakar patr ko ek chaal se ghumaya jaataa he or chhidron ke sameep aankh lagaakar gatiman vastu kaa nirikshan kiya jaataa he
 The object is visible only when the hole is exposed to the object
 yadi kisi aavritidarshi ko aisi gati se ghumaya jaae ki mashin kii prayek aavriti main mashin kaa vahi bhaag ghoomte patr ke ek chhidr ke saamne baraabar aata rahe to drushtisthaapakatv ke kaaran chalati hui mashin hamen sthir, kintu saamaanya prakaash main dhundhlee, dikhaai padegi
 The machine must remain in very bright light for clear inspection
 yadi ekasmaan teevr prakaash ke badale mashin ko prakaash main rahanaa chahie
 If the machine is illuminated by intense light instead of uniform fast light, and if the frequency of the fire is high enough that one of the sparks falls on exactly one of the revolutions on the machine, then the machine will look stable
 is aayojan se mashin ke kisi bhaag ke kisi bhaag ko photo liya ja saktaa he, uskaa nirikshan kiya ja saktaa he or mashin kaa koniya veg gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 The frequency number of a oscillating object, such as a staggered oscillator, can also be derived
 aavritidarshi aa ko vidyut motor mo dwaara ghumaya jaataa he
 The number of revolutions of the frequency can be corrected by increasing the speed of the motor at will and the value of the revolver can be determined from the counter mounted on the axis of the motor
 doordarshee du aavritidarshi ke chhidr par sadha rahata he
 Between this telescope and the magnifier, the electrometer is placed in a horizontal position, in which one leaf of aluminum is placed on both arms of the tuner

 In this way the hole between the leaves opens and closes in a second as often as the vocal frequency
 iske baad aavritidarshi ko chalaakar swaritra ko vidyut dwaara dolit karte hai
 Due to the effect of electricity, oscillation of the oscillator remains permanent
 doordarshee main aavritidarshi ke chhidr pehle dhundhale, phir motor kii gati badhane ke saath falkar purna vrittakar ho jate hai
 As the speed increases, the holes are clearly visible
 yah tabhi sambhav hota he jab swaritra ke dolankaal main aavritidarshi kaa ek chhidr nikatavarti duusare chhidr ke sthaan par ghumkar aa jaataa he
 If the speed of the cycle is reduced a little, then the holes appear to be moving slowly backwards and if the speed is increased a little, then the holes seem to move slowly in the forward direction
 jab chhidr spasht sthir dikhaai padate hai to aavritidarshi kii bhramansankhya dekhakar swaritra kii aavritisankhya gyaat kii ja sakati he
 If there are a number of holes on the circle of the circle and the circle rotates in one second, then the frequency of the oscillator is less
 aavritidarshi kii gati isaki thik duni athwa tiguni, chauguni ityadi hone par bhi chhidr isi prakaar sthir dikhaai padate hai
 For this reason, the speed of the oscillator in the experiment is initially increased slowly by keeping it low

 If f make only one round in the same direction in one second and according to the picture, if the first glow is on circle 1, then the two points of this circle will appear just below each other
 duusari damak ke pahonchte hi vrutt 1 ke sthaan par vrutt 2 aa jayega or bindu dakshinavart disha main mude jaan padenge
 As soon as the third moment comes, circle 3 will come in place of circle 1 and the points will appear more bent
 vrutt sab ek samaan hai or sab baari se sthaan 1 par aate hai, jahaan prakaash kii damaken padati hai
 Therefore, the circles will appear stationary and their inner points rotate clockwise
 patr c ke centre ke sameep teen khaanedaar vrutt banaae gaye hai, jinamein ekantar kram se safed kaale khaane bane hue hai
 The intermediate circle has 13 white and 13 black fields
 bhitari vrutt main 12 safed or 12 kaale khaane hai or bahari vrutt main prayek prakaar ke 14 aise khaane hai
 At the equilibrium of the relative speeds of both the letters f and a, that the circles of the circumference seem to be constant, the middle circle in these three central column circles will appear to be stationary, outer clockwise and inner counterclockwise

 Due to the geographical distance separating it from the other tournaments, the top American and European players rarely deigned to travel down to the Antipodes until the end of the 1970s, meaning that the title was almost exclusively won by Australians up until that date
 In 1972, The Australian Tennis Federation decided to change the venue of the event every year, with Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and even New Zealand taking turns to host the tournament
 In 1983, the Australian Open set up home in Kooyong, Melbourne, where it began to earn the respect of the tennis-playing world until its move in 1988 to Flinders Park
 Grass courts made way for hard rebound ace surfaces, and in 1997, Flinders Park was renamed Melbourne Park

 Although the earthquake does not occur much in the Caribbean zone, the reason for the earthquake here is the strike slip fault
 isamen prithvi ke crust ke do bade khand aapas main ek duusare ko aage-peeche dhakelte hai
 For this reason, due to slipping several times, one of the crusts of earth becomes upward
 bhucamp tab aata he jab dharti kii jatil paraten, jo ek duusare ke saath satee hoti hai, dhime-dhime hilti hai
 The Haiti's earthquake-prone Caribbean and North American plates move each other in an east-west direction

 This was particularly stimulated by the immediate court culture and Sanskrit literature
 sanskrit sahityashastra ke katipay anshon ne use shastreey anushaasan kii ore pravrutt kiya
 In Hindi, the word 'riti' or 'poetry' was used for poetry
 isliye kavyashastrabaddh saamaanya srujanpravriti or ras, alankaar aadi ke nirupak bahusankhyak lakshangranthon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue is samay ke kavy ko 'reetikavy' kaha gaya
 The clearest signs of the old tradition of the poetic nature of this poetry are found in the adhikavya of Sanskrit, Prakrit, Apabhransh, Persian and Hindi, and the sringari tendencies of Krishnakavya
 is kaal main kai kavi aise hue hai jo acharya bhi the or jinhone vividh kavyangon ke lakshan dene vaale granth bhi likhe
 Shringar dominated in this era

 Most of the poets of Reetikal were courtiers
 keshavadas, pratap singh, bihari, matiram, bhushan, chintamani, dev, bhikharidas, raghunatha, benny, gang, tikaaram, gwaal, chandrasekhar bajpei, harnaam, kulapati mishra, nevaaj, surati mishra, kavindra udaynath, rishinath, ratan kavi, benny bandijan, benny praveen, brahmadatt, thakur bundelkhandi, bodha, gumaan mishra aadi or anek kavi to raja hi the, jaise- maharaj jaswant singh, bhagawant raay khichi, bhupati, rasanidhi, maharaj vishwanath, dwijadev 
 Ritikavya's work was started by a Sanskritist
 ye the acharya keshavadas, jinaki sarvaprasiddh rachanaayen kavipriya, rasikapriya or ramchandrika hai
 In Kavipriya, the ornamentation and rasikapriya have the illustrative representation of rasa
 lakshan dohon main or udhaaharan kavittasavaie main hai
 This tradition of symptoms-goal-texts developed in Ritikavya
 ramchandrika keshav kaa prabandhkavy he jisamen bhakthi kii tanmayata ke sthaan par ek sajag kalakaar kii prakhar kalachetana prasphutit hui
 Several decades after Keshava, from the Chintamani to the eighteenth century, the Ajastra source of ritualism flowed in Hindi, with a very artistic expression of the delightful aspects of male-female-life and the Saras sensitivities of it
 reetikaal ke kavi raajaaon or raison ke aashray main rahete the
 There was a natural atmosphere of entertainment and artistry
 bauddhik anand kaa mukhya saadhan vahaan uktivaichitraya samajha jaataa tha
 Literature written in such an environment was mostly erotic and artistic
 par isi samay prem ke svachhand gayak bhi hue jinhone prem kii gaharaaiyon kaa sparsh kiya he
 Both in terms of quantity and poetry, this period's poetic euphemism of male-female love and beauty is important
 is samay virakavy bhi likhaa gaya
 The disturbance of the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb's clash with staunch communalism and aggressive politics led to the creation of Virakavya by some poets during this period
 aise kaviyon main bhushan pramukh hai jinhone reetistylee ko apanaate hue bhi veeron ke parakram kaa ojasvi varnan kiya
 At this time poetry related to policy, quietness and devotion was also written
 anek prabandhkavy bhi nirmit hue
 In this research work, non-modern compositions and anthropologies of this time are being found in abundance
 isliye reetikalin kavy ko nitant ekangi or ekarup samajhnaa uchit nahin he
 All the tendencies of the earlier periods are active in poetry of this time
 yah pradhan dhara shringaarakavy kii he jo is samay kii kavyasampatti kaa vaastavik nidarshak maani jaati rahi he
 Shringari poetry is divided into three sections
 pehla varg reetibaddh kaviyon kaa he jiske pratinidhi keshav, chintamani, bhikharidas, dev, matiram or padmakar aadi hai
 These poets have given artistic signs of love and beauty to the poetess by giving signs of rasa, ornamentation and heroine in couplets
 sanskrit sahityashastra main nirupit shastreey charchaa kaa anusaran maatr inamen adhik he
 But some have also shown some originality, such as Bhikharidas's representation of Hindi verses
 doosraa varg ritisiddh kaviyon kaa he
 These poets did not depict the symptoms, only based their poetry on them
 bihari inamen sarvshereshth hai, jinhone dohon main apni "satsai' prastut kii
 Extremely expressive aesthetics with different postures and unique expressions of love are found in his poetry
 tisare varg main ghanaanand, bodha, dwijadev thakur aadi reetimukt kavi aate hai jinhone svachhand prem kii abhivyakti kii he
 His compositions have a very impressive euphemism of intensity and intensity of love
 reetikavy mukhyat: maansal shringaar kaa kavy he
 It has a beautiful opening to the delightful sides of male and female life
 adhik kavy muktak style main he, par prabandhkavy bhi hai
 In these two hundred years, Shringarakavya had an extraordinary rise
 par dhire dhire reeti kii jakad badhati gai or hindi kavy kaa bhavakshetra sankeern hota gaya
 By coming to the modern era, the attention of writers was particularly attracted to these two shortcomings

 praayah sab kaviyon ne braj-bhashaa ko apanaaya he
 Less well-written independent poetry, Rasa, Alankar et cetera while writing the characteristics of Kavyangas as an example - especially as an example of adornments and stimuli - Saras compositions were written in this era
 bhushan kavi ne vir ras kii rachanaaen bhi deen
 The art-side was more prosperous than the sentiment
 shabd-shakti par vishesh dhyaan nahin diya gaya, na naatayashastra kaa vivechan kiya gaya
 The subjects became hesitant and originality began to decline
 is samay anek kavi hue— keshav, chintamani, dev, bihari, matiram, bhushan, ghanaanand, padmakar aadi
 Of these, Keshav, Bihari and Bhushan can be considered as the representative poets of this era
 bihari ne dohon kii sambhaavnaaon ko purna rup se viksit kar diya
 You can be considered a representative poet of rituals
 is kaal ke kaviyon ko teen shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he- Custom poet reetimukt kavi Well-known poet vidwaanon kaa yah bhi mat ha ki is kaal ke kaviyon ne kavy main maryaada kaa purna paalan kiya he

 It would also be interesting for a person to know that the writings related to Buddha's teachings were called Kanjur while the writings related to the teachings of Indian saints and scholars were called Tanjur

 Many of these important sections are kept in this institution
 agar boudhd dharm or iske darshan par najar daali jaae or vivaranon par gaur kiya jaae to tibeti sahitya kaa ek bada hissaa dharm se sambandhit hoga
 On the other hand, despite having fewer books on secular subjects, these are no less important for the scholars and intellectuals of today's modern era

 In France, "la Nouvelle Manga" has evolved into a form of bande desine designed to be influenced by the Japanese manga style
 sanyukt rajya america main, log maanga jaisi comics ko amerimanga, world maanga athwa mul rup se angreji bhashaa main maanga kahkar sanderbhit karte hai
 The Japanese word manga literally translates to "piquant picture"

 Their views differ in the relative importance they attribute to the role of post-world War II versus pre-war cultural and historical events, Meiji and pre-meiji Japanese culture and art
 ek drishy america dwaara japan ke kabje ke baad or uske dauraan hone vaali ghatnaon par jor detaa he or is baat par vishesh bal detaa he ki manga shashakt tareeke se america ke saanskrithik prabhaavon ko pradarshit karata he, jisame U
S kamiks or america televijan, film or cartoon se chitra or vishay-vastu ko sammilit kiya gaya he
 Alternatively, other authors such as Frédéric L
 Skodt, Kinko Lato, and Adam L
 Karna emphasize the continuity of Japanese culture and aesthetic traditions central to the history of manga
 aadhunik manga kii utpatti ke adhigrahan or main uttar-adhigrahan ke bich hui, jab pehle se sanyavad or ati rashtravaadi japan ne raajnneetik or aarthik buniyadi dhaanche kaa punarnirmaan kiya
 The period saw a burst of artistic creativity, involving sought-after artists such as Osamu Tezuka and Machiko Hasegawa

 is varg main hegio moto, riyoko ikeda, yumico oshima,kiko takemia or rayoko yamagishi shaamil the or unhone maanga main mahila kalakaaron kii pehali badi pravishti chihnit kii thi
 After this, for young women and girl readers, mainly manga women artists will draw shojo
 In the coming decades, the development of shोजjo manga continues in a stylistic manner while synchronously distinct but overlapping subgenres are emerging
 pramukh upasheliyon main romance, superhiroins, "ledis komix" shaamil hai
 The modern shोजjo manga romance portrays love as a major theme embodied in an emotionally intense narrative of self-realization
 superhiroins ke saath, shojo maanga ne noko takeuchee kii prity soljar celler moon jaisi relies dekhi he, jo antarrashtriya str par maanga or aneme praaroop donon main lokapriy ho gayi thi
 The class of girls working together has also become popular under this style

 vidhishastra yaa nyaayashastra, vidhi kaa siddhanth, adhyayan va darshan hai
 This includes all legal principles that make laws
 vidhishastra ke vidwaan, jinhen jurist yaa vidhik siddhantavaadi bhi kaha jaataa hai, vidhi, vidhik karann, vidhik pranali or vidhik sansthaaon ke prakruti kii gahari samaj praapt kar paane kii aashaa rakhte hai
 Jurisprudence as a science of law, is a special kind of research about law
 saadhaaran arth main samast vaidhanik siddhant vidhishastra main antarnihit hai
 Jurisprudence "jurisprudence" ie Juris = Legislation, Prudence = Knowledge
 is arth main kanoon kii sari pustaken vidhishastra kii pustaken hai
 In this context, the only meaning of the law is the general law of the country, which is completely separate from the rules, which are called law because of their resemblance to law
 yadi ham vigyaan shabd kaa prayog iske adhik se adhik vyapak rup main kare jisamen bauddhik anusandhan ke kisi bhi vishay kaa gyaan ho jaae to ham kah sakate hai ki vidhishastra desh ke saadhaaran kanoon kaa vigyaan he
 The oldest Indian jurisprudence is present in many texts of theology, such as Bodhoyan's theology
 vidhi main maanav ko bhaavnaatmak sambal pradaan karne va prakruti dwaara pradutt sukh-suvidhaon ke samyak upbhog hetu samaan adhikaar he
 This method, protected in human interest by law, is called "natural law"
 alpian -"daivi or maanviya vastuon kaa gyaan, uchit evam anuchit vastuon kaa vigyaan" Jurisprudence is divided into three branches - vaidhanik abhidarshan kaa uddeshy he kisi prastaavit vidhi kii pranali ke tathy ko, chaahe vah vartmaan ho athwa bhootkaal main iskaa astitv rahaa ho, upasthit karnaa
 The purpose of statutory history is to present the historical process by which a law system has developed or occurred
 vidhinirmaan ke siddhant kaa uddeshy he kanoon ko upasthit karnaa-vah kanoon nahin jo vartmaan he yaa bhootkaal main tha, balki vah kanoon jo desh, kaal, paatr ke anusaar hona uchit he
 Jurisprudence does not expect the present or past of any legal system, it is related to its ideal future
 vidhishastra siddhanth ke teen ang hote hai- vishleshnatmak vidhishastra, aitihaasik vidhishastra, evam naitik vidhishastra
 The analytical branch consists of philosophical or general ideas of systematic legal theory; The historical branch contains the philosophical or general part of the legal history; The moral branch contains philosophical principles of legislation
 kintu ye teenon shakhaayen paraspar sambhddha hai
 Therefore, separating them from each other cannot consider them
 dekhen, vishleshnatmak vidhishastra The purpose of analytical jurisprudence is - 'analysis of fundamental principles of legislation'
 inke aitihaasik udgam, vikaas, naitik bhav athwa manyata par is prasang main vichaar aavashyak hota he
 The following topics are covered under this- mulat: vidhaan ke saadhaaran siddhanton ke udgam evam unke vikaas se sambhddha he
 The sources by which the ordinary legislation of the country is affected are also within its limits
 anya shabdon main, yah vidhaan ke mul siddhant evam unki paddati kii bhaavana kaa itihaas he
 Ethical jurisprudence treats the law in terms of moral seriousness and its completeness
 kanoon kii pranali ke bauddhik tatv athwa iske aitihaasik vikaas se ise koi prayojan nahin he
 The purpose of the legislation and to what extent and in what form it is fulfilled, this is its subject
 saadhaarant: iskaa lakshya evam uddeshy kisi raajnneetik ferme ke antargat rajya kii bhautik shakti dwaara nyaay kaa paalan karne main he
 Hence, moral jurisprudence looks at how far the principle of justice is related to legislation
 yah naitik evam vaidhanik darshan kaa milanbindu he
 Justice in its general form is related to morality or moral philosophy
 apane vishesh rup main nyaay, desh ke kanoon kii antim shrunkhlaa ke rup main vaidhanik darshan kii us shakha se sambhddha he, jise naitik vidhishastra kehete hai
 General within its periphery: The following topics fall under- dekhen, tulanaatmak vidhishastra In different countries of the world, jurisprudence has been defined in some different forms
 germany ke vidhaan main vidhishastra kanoon kaa motamoti vah paryaay he, jiskaa lakshya vaigyanik adhyayan hota he
 In the French legislation, this gives a sense of jurisdiction of the court, which distorts and develops the "code" of the law
 angreji evam amareeki vidhaan main sannihit hai
 Sanatana is based on theology in Indian legislation
 "dharm" kii paribhaasha nimnlikhit rup main kii gai he- That is, Vedas, Smriti, Virtue and Suniti are the origin of religion
 "dharm" vyapak shabd he
 From religious, moral, social and legal point of view, it is a collection of duties and responsibilities of man
 dharmik evam dharm nirpeksh bhaavana ke bich vibhaajan rekha sthapit nahin kii ja sakati, kyonki kitne hi vishay aise hai jo dharmik evam sansaarik donon hai
 The eternal religion of India is not based on the order of the king or ruler
 isaki manyata isi main antarnihit he
 Smritiks and their ancestors have stated that “dharma is the gift of God
 yah raajaaon kaa raja he
 No one is more powerful than this
 isaki sahaayta se shaktiheen bhi shaktishaalee se apana adhikaar le sakate hai
 The king is not the creator of justice, only its foster
 " According to the theory of jurist Austin Kinwa Bentham, most of Sanatana Dharma will be embedded in morality, because this "religion" is not the order of a king or sovereign ruler
 yah satya he ki smriti apane tain kanoon nahin he, kyonki ise na to vyavasthapika sabha ne banaaya or na rajya ne ghoshit kiya
 But it was valid on the principle of Jas Receptum, that is, society had accepted it
 at: ek mat ke anusaar smriti ke kanoon kaa udgam samaaj hi he
 a part of it is moral order, the source of which is considered natural and the relic is tradition and virtue
 smritikaron ke vyaktitv evam sammaan tathaa suniti par aadhaarit hone ke kaaran smriti ke vachanon kii manyata hi inke vaidhanik vyadesh kaa praadhikaar he
 When the authentic version of Kautilya's Arthashastra was published, a controversy arose whether the legislative legislation in India was at any time more valid than the law declared by theology
 kautilya ne kaha he ki vidhaan chaar stambhon par aadhaarit he- Of these, the latter basis is more powerful than the preceding basis, but it is worth remembering that no fundamental order or practice alleged in theology by the royal edict was violated
 kautilya ne bhi saidhantik rup main yah sweekaar kiya tha ki rajanirmit vidhaan dharamshastra kii paridhi se baahar nahin he
 See, Legal Sociology 19veen shatabdi ke aarambh main francisi darshanik august kont ne soshiyalogy shabd kaa namakaran kiya
 Sociology is largely a study of society
 samajashastri ke adhyayan main vidhaan bhi sammilit he kintu uskaa drushtikon se bhinn he
 The lawyer, as advocate or adjudicator, sees the rules that the general public should emulate
 samajashastravetta yah dekhtaa he ki ye niyam kya hai
 To some extent both can follow, because in reality these rules are indicative of the desired character
 kintu samajashastravetta ko vaastavik charitra main adhik utsukata rahati he, vaanchit charitra ke vichaar main nahin
 Statutory sociology is also called criminology
 yah aparaadhon ke kaaran, aparaadhiyon ke charitra, vibhinn prakaar ke dandon kaa aparaadhiyon par prabhaav - visheshat: kahan tak dandon se aparaadh ke ghatane par prabhaav padataa he - in sab kaa adhyayan karata he
 This facilitates the reform of the law
 samand ke anusaar vidhishastra ke adhyayan kii apni abhyaantarik ruchi he jiske kaaran isaki tulana kisi gambhir gyaan kii shakha se kii ja sakati he
 In fact there is a natural attraction of inference and theory
 vidhishastrik anusandhan vidhik, raajnneetik, saamaajik aadi vichaaron ko prabhavit karte hai atev vidhishastra kaa adhyayan mahatvapurn he
 The study of jurisprudence increases the intensity of contemplation of human beings
 diase ke anusaar yah vidhi-vetta ko siddhanth or jivan prakaash laan kaa suavasar detaa he kyonki yah saamaajik vigyaan ke sambandh main maanav vichaaron par vichaar karata he
 Logical analysis of legal concepts leads to the development of logical method of legalists
 isse vidhivetta kii vyavsaayik praroopvaad kii buraai ko dur kiya ja saktaa he
 Dias believed that by developing life in the legal system, it gives inspiration to the genius of the scholar
 je ji philimor ne spasht kiya he ki vidhishastra kaa vigyaan itnaa ucch stareey he ki iskaa gyaan iske adhyeta ko gyanpurn avadharanaon or manovegon, jo maanav paristhitiyon main utpann sabhi apekshaaon main lagu ho sake, ke saath jivan main pravesh karaata he
 Laski evaluates the importance of jurisprudence and calls it the 'eye of the Law'
 vidhi kii badhati gutthiyon evam maanav sambandhon kii jatiltaaon ke niraakaran kaa rasta vidhishastra ke adhyayan main paaya ja saktaa he
 That is why it has been considered the grammar of the method
 aniruddh prasad ke anusaar vidhishastra kaa jaagruk adhyayan saamaajik samasyaon ke samaadhaan evam nyaay kii sarthakata ko avashyabhavi karata he
 The current jail reform, the expectation of human behavior with prisoners, the right to live with human dignity, social action litigation, and the investigation of public interest promises have arisen from the new legislative approach
 isi prakaar paryaavaran sudhaar vidhi, garibon k liye muft kanoonee sahaayta aadi vidhishastra or anya saamaajik vigyaanon kii antarvidya gyaan ke aadan-pradaan tathaa parsparik prabhaavon kii dein he
 Jurisprudence not only teaches the theoretical basis of the basic concepts of various branches of law, but also provides knowledge of their interrelationships
 vidhishastra keval vidhik pranali ke madhyam se nyaay prashasit hi nahin karata varan naveen siddhanton, vichaaron evam anya marga kii khoj ke madhyam se nyaaypurna samaaj kii sthapana main sahaayak hota he
 In the end, jurisprudence gives us a sense of the study, research and inference whose primary goal is the question of the commoner 


 "what is law"? Has to be answered
 vidhivetta kii drushti main kanoon un prabhaavon kii samshti he, jinke dwaara nyaayalayon main nirnay die jate hai
 The first goal of the law is to eliminate social conflicts, although all kinds of conflicts do not fall within this limit
 vidhivetta rasko pound ke anusaar kanoon kaa kaary yah he ki vah logon ke parsparik haq kaa santulan kare, jisase prayek vyakti ko adhiktam mili evam samaaj ke hit ke liye use nunatam tyaag karnaa pade
 Interspecies is an organism that inhabits the body or cells of another organism in a symbiotic relationship
 yah aavashyak nahin he ki yah sambandh parsparik rup se laabhadaayak ho
 An example of this is bacteria that live in the gastrointestinal tract of humans
 yah bacteria maanav dwaara khaaye gayi bhojan ke pachan main sahaayak hote hai or swayan is bhojan se inkaa poshan hota he

 dwitara yaa dwisangi tara do taron kaa ek mandal hota he jisamen donon taare apane saanjhe dravyaman centre kii parikrama karte hai
 In the gates, the more illuminating star is called the main star and the less illuminating star is called the main star or the "companion star"
 kabhi-kabhi dwitara or doharaa tara kaa ek hi arth niklaa jaataa he, lekin in donon main bhinnataayen hai
 Double stars are two stars that appear to be collected from the earth

 Which of these positions is in a double star can be checked by measuring parallax
 angrezi main "dwitare" ko "binary star" or "dohare taare" ko "dabl star" kaha jaataa he

 There is a punishment for a team fielding in a game called Noble or no-ball cricket, which is mainly due to the bowler not throwing the ball as per the rules

 iskaa arth yah hua ki no-ball ke aage vaali gend par ballebaaj, out hone ke bhay ke bina kisi bhi prakaar gend ko khel saktaa he
 No-ball is not uncommon and such bowling is seen due to shorter format games and long run-up mainly by fast bowlers
 kuch prakaar kii no-ball khatarnaak tathaa anuchit maani jaati hai
 If such a ball is thrown, the bowler can be suspended immediately with the bowling
 no-ball vibhinn kaarnon se ho sakati he
 This is mainly due to the bowler breaking one of the following rules
