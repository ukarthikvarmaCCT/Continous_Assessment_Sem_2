 ab tak paryaavaran sangrakshan ke liye paryaavarnavaad, harith raajnneeti, paryaavarniya nariwad pramukh avadharana rahe he, jo ek samaajik aandolan ke rup main prakritik sansadhano, paryaavaran sangrakshan, evam paristhitikeey pranaaliyon kii raksha ke liye, jisamen paryaavaran ke prati samaajik shiksha, paryaavaran sakriyata ke madhyam se paryaavarniya raajnneetik prakriya ko prabhavit kiya jaataa he or paryaavarniya maanako ko apane avadharanaon main nirdhaarit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Green politics is an environmental revolution, while environmental politics is the exploitation of resources in the name of allied development and the development of the environment as a priority
 paryaavaran raajnneeti ek naveen avadharana ke rup main he, jisamen raajnneeti ko mahatv diya jaataa he or paryaavaran ko jaan boojhkar najar andaaj kiya jaataa hai
 Environmental politics is a political trick in which politics is a way through which the environmental resources of different nations are obtained and there is a way to exploit them
 paryaavarniya raajnneeti ek poonjeewaadi vikasvaadi raajnneetik kii namoona he jisamen vikaas ke naam par sansadhano kii lut machaaya hua he
 Environmental politics is the robbery of natural resources in the name of development, in which only politics is given importance, the environment which gets burnt
 aaj nahin ho rahaa he vaigyanikon ke chetavanee ke baavjood paryaavaran sangrakshan jo vikaas kii bhet chadh rahi he
 And the political gains which are actually linked to the economic gains that all nations are competing to get, and the politics of this profit has stole from taking any historical responsibility for the protection of the environment, its time bound responsibility
 
 paryaavarni raajnneeti vikaas ke naam par aisa praturup he jisamen sansadhano ko puunji samajhataa he or prakritik smapda ko ‘‘camodity’’ ke rup main liya jaataa he
 And sees water, forest, land and minerals converted into market value because the character of the state is the defining direction of political economy
 paryaavarniya raajnneeti jo ki vikaas ke naam par upabhoktavaadi, bazaarvaadi or suvidhapurti ban chukaa he
 It seeks to link every item of resources with global capitalism
 paryaavarniya raajnneeti vikaas kaa vah praturup he jo ki shuddh ‘‘upyogetavaad’’ par aadhaarit hote he or sachmuch main yah ek aisi vidanmbana he ki yah sab kuch desh ke aadhunikeekaran, rashtranirmaan, bahumukhi vikaas or sakal gharelu utpaadan main vruddhi ke naam par kiya ja rahaa he

 Actually, i believe that this three slogan or principle of developed, developing, underdeveloped is in fact completely wrong
 main iskaa virodh karata hoon
 These are the three slogans of development, the trick that the nation considers itself to be developed is that they have made this mistake
 agar poonji ekatra karnaa, infrestrarcchar khadaa karnaa, udyog sthapit karke, adhik utpaadan karnaa, suvidhaon ko hi badhanaa, sansadhano kaa dohan karnaa, sansadhano ke rup main istemaal karnaa hi viksit raashtra kaa paimaana he, to apane hi pair par kulhadi maarna he

 The reason for this is that even on important environmental issues such as environmental protection, carbon emissions, climate change, various nations see profit and loss during the agreements and here the creation is on the verge of destruction, these nations are lying in profit and loss
 
 aaj paryaavaran sangrakshan ke naam par yaa jalwaayu parivartan, jaev vividyata, carbon katautee, ke naam par kai sanndhi, samjhauta, protocol, sammelan hue he yaa ho rahe he, koi thos nateeja nahin aa rahaa he, keval ve log meeting main eating karte he
 Environmental protection is not only for the benefit of the nation but is still relevant in the solution of every problem of the nation and environmentalism which has taken the form of a social movement today

 Due to deep concern with the science of environment, environmentalists are also called circumstantialists and environmentalism is termed as ecological science, because under this movement, the emphasis is on maintaining greenery in the environment, hence the politics inspired by it is green revolution or green
 Politics is called noun
 kuch desh jaise newjiland, pashchimi germany or britain main green party banaaye gayi hai is aandolan ko kaayam karne ke liye par zyada safalataa hasil nahin hue he
 Early signs of the environment are found in EF Shumaker's work "papusam" jiske antargat audyogikeekaran samaaj kii samiksha prastut kii gai thi

 main har prakaar kii hinsa kaa virdohi hoon or maanata hoon ki vaicharik shakti khatm hone par hi insaan hinsa, shakti kaa prayog karata he
 i do not believe that the way terrorism is defined today, it threatens the country or the world

 Who will liberate them from the terror that is wreaking havoc on them day by day? Today, this is the reason why citizens and states are coming face to face in water, forest, land battles, which we call Naxalites

 There is a big discussion of climate change around the world, the capitalist country is trying to sell the carbon that they produce to poor countries

 Along with the industrial revolution, modern environmental problems also arose in Europe
 paryaavarnavaad audyogikaran ke pratikriya ke rup main ek aandolan he
 So far for the protection of the environment which are concepts such as environmentalism, green politics, environmental feminism, as well as various protocols for environmental protection among different nations, treaty on nuclear testing, biodiversity, solutions to climate change problems Efforts are on for kyota protocol ke alaava ab tak koi thos parinaam nahin niklaa he
 The politics of development ignored environmental protection and as a result development has become a crisis
 jise ‘‘vikaas sankat’’ kaha ja saktaa hai
 You can distribute the land in the name of development, but cannot distribute the sky, we have to do such development in which nature is also saved and development should also be done
 paryaavarniya nariwad - paryaavarniya nariwad ne mahila ko prakruti ke saath jodne kaa prayaas kiya he
 It is known that since ancient times in the society the men have been responsible for the exploitation of women
 isi tarah purush varg ne paryaavaran sansaadhan kaa atidohan kar paryaavaran ko vinaash ke kagaar par pahunchaa diya he
 Therefore, the credit of the suppression of both women and nature is jointly with the men

 Environmentalists like Vandana Siva and Plywood Edina Merchant believe that there is a similarity between nature and woman as both nourish
 prakruti or mahila donaan main chakri prakriya hoti he tathaa donaan hi shoshan ke shikaar he
 This class also believes that the exploitation of nature affects women the most because it is more dependent on nature
 
 Therefore, the worst effect of messing with nature is on women only because women are close to nature

 nar kii sahaayak granthiyaan ek drav padaarth utsarjit karti hai jo shukranuon main mishrit ho jaataa he
 Sometimes the spermatozoa become a globular packet, which secrete the supporting glands of the female, called the spermatheca, together the eggs, or affix the leaves or eggs to other objects
 kabhi kabhi is srav se andon ko rakhane ke liye thili bhi ban jaati he, jaise telchatta main
 These Barre glands produce toxin, which enters the body of the victim at the time of stinging
 andsansechan donon lingon ke sanyog par nirbhar he
 In some pests it can occur many times in life
 yah saadhaaran rup se maithun or shukran dwaara andey ke sansechan par nirbhar karata he
 Most insects lay eggs, which eventually give birth to children, but some insects give birth to eggs or nymphs in place of eggs
 aise kiton ko jarayuj kehete hai, jaise druuka or glocina Some insects do not impregnate eggs with sperm
 is prakaar kaa janan anishekajanan kehalaata he
 In some castes, this is a unique and sometimes occurring phenomenon, and in some moths, both males and females are produced from undigested eggs
 saamaajik madhumakhiyon main anishekajanan bahudhaa hota he, kintu asansechit andon se keval nar hi utpann hote hai
 In some stick pests, the majority of females are produced from undigested eggs and very few males
 safilaies main naron kii utpatti sambhavat: hoti hi nahin, is kaaran sansechan ho hi nahin saktaa
 As a result there is only parthenogenesis
 drumayuka main chakree anishekajanan hota he, arthath asansechit or sansechit andon main utpaadan niyamanusaar kram se hota rahata he
 In some species, insectivores also breed
 is ghatana ko peedogensis kehete hai
 The eggs of the mister insect produce other eggs and thus continue to be produced for several generations
 iske pashchaat inamen se kuch dimbh parivardhit hokar praudh nar or maadaa ban jate hai, jo paraspar maithun ke pashchaat dimbh utpann karte hai
 Production starts again as before these eggs
 bahubhrunata kaa arth he
 More than one insect is produced from an egg
 is prakaar kaa utpaadan parashrayi kalapakshon main paaya jaataa he
 Two eggs are produced from some eggs of the platigester hemellis, but each egg of a parasitic calcid produces about one thousand eggs
 kuch kiton main maithun keval ek hi baar hota he
 Thereafter one dies, as in the pests of Ephemeroptera
 madhumakhi kii rani yadhyapi kai varsh tak jivit rahati he, tathaapi maithun keval ek hi baar karti he or ek hi baar main itani paryaapt maatra main shukranu pahunch jate hai ki jivan bhar iske andon kaa sansechan karte rahete hai
 The male dies shortly after copulation
 bahut se kiton ke nar jivan main kai baar pruthak-pruthak maadaaon se maithun karte hai or bahut se kanchukapakshon ke nar or maadaa donon barbar maithun karte hai
 Eggs are usually very small
 phir bhi andey ko dekh kar yah batalaana praaia: sambhav hota he ki andey se kis prakaar kaa keet nikalegaa
 Often this is very important, because it can predict the harmful condition of harmful insects
 isliye andon ke aakaar, rup or rang tathaa andey rakhane ke sthaan or vidhi kaa dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he
 Eggs can be flat, cauliflower, spherical, conical and wide
 andey kaa upree aavaran purna rup se chikna yaa vibhinn prakaar ke chinhnonvala hota he
 Eggs are laid separately or in communities
 telchatte ke andey dimbhakoshth ke bheetar rahete hai
 Eggs from aquatic insects are covered with a sticky paste
 andey main vruddhi karte hue bhrun ke poshan ke liye paryaapt maatra main bhojan, jo yoke kehalaata he, paaya jaataa he
 Eggplantation occurs in various ways
 andey aise sthanon par rakhe jate hai, jahaan utpann honevaali santan kii tatkaaleen aavashyaktaayen purna ho saken
 Females of some castes fly low, dropping their eggs randomly
 bahut se shalbhon kii maadaaen, jinke dimbh ghaas yaa uski jad khate he, udate samay apane andey ghaas par giraati chali jaati hai
 Eggs are usually laid on such plants, entered into the tissue of the plants, which eat the eggs, as in some types of locusts
 kuch keet apane andey mitti main rakhte hai
 The insects of the parasitic castes lay their eggs above or within the nutrients that nourish their offspring
 vibhinn jatiyon kii maadaaon ke andon kii sankhya vibhinn hoti he
 The females of some castes of Drumayuka lay only one large egg during the winter
 gharelu makkhi apane jivan main 2,000 se adhik andey rakhti he
 The termite queen has the highest egg-laying power
 yah prati second ek anda de sakati he or apane chah se baarah varsh tak ke jivan main 10,00,000 andey detii he
 Addition begins after the impregnation of the egg
 prarambh main do staravaala mul patta yaa germ band banataa he, jo anuprastha rekhaon dwaara bees andon main vibhakt ho jaataa he
 The next six segments form the head, the latter three segments the chest and the remaining segments together with the telsen
 pratham khand or telson ke atirikt prayek khand main ek joda bhruneey avyav viksit ho jaataa he
 The first pair of components belong to the second block and form the rings
 dwitiya jodi bahut hi choti or kshanik hoti he
 The components of the third, fourth and fifth pair develop into mandibles, maxillae, and labium
 inke peeche vaale teen jodi avyav kuch bade tathaa spasht hote hai
 It is the anterior of the legs
 udar ke avyavon kii antim jodi sarasai ban jaati hai kintu shesh sab jodiyaan dimbh nikalne se purv hi praaia: nasht ho jaati he
 Breaking the egg - When the embryo has fully developed and is ready to hatch, the hatchet comes out by removing the pre-made cap with its thorns that break the egg
 kuch kiton main aarambh main bhrun vaayu nigalkar apana vistaar itnaa badha lete hai ki shukti tut jaati he
 Her muscles help the child to get out
 andey se nikalne ke pashchaat hi vruddhi aarambh hoti he
 The increase in size of insect from birth to adulthood is very surprising
 praudh keet kii taul janm hone ke samay kii taul se 1,000 se 70,000 guna tak ho sakati he
 Such a growth cannot take place within a shell whose expansion cannot be increased
 at: khol kaa tootna ati aavashyak he
 This is possible only with the fall of the snakeskin
 jeern bahyatvak ko kentul kehete hai
 Before the rupture of a chronic ectoderm, cells within the epidermis within it emit a new ectoderm
 tatpashchaat inamen se kuch vishesh prakaar kii koshikaon se, jo kentul granthiyaan kehalaati hai, ek drav padaarth nikalataa he
 This fluid substance dissolves the inner layer of the old exterior and separates it from the new external, making it soft and itself becomes a finer membrane between the old and new exterior
 aise samay main keet main vruddhi ho jaati he
 The shape of the insect after the fall of the snake is called instar
 jab keet andey se nikalataa he to pratham instar hota he, pratham kentul patan ke pashchaat keet dwitiya instar hota he, antim inastar purna keet yaa praudh keet kehalaata he
 In most insects, the shape and form of the egg that comes out of the egg is very different from the adult insect
 bahut se kiton main dimbh kii akruti or rup main praudh banane tak anek parivartan aa jate hai
 These types of changes are called transformations
 jin kiton main roopantaran nahin hota unhen roopantaranhin kehete hai
 An example of this is Leha
 adhiktar kiton main roopatanran hota he or aise keet metabola kehalaate hai
 There are two types of functional obsolescence found in insects
 ye ninf or dimbh kehalaate hai
 Nymph is called a late stage insect which is more advanced when it hatches
 ninf kaa purna keet se yah bhed hota he ki isamen paksh tathaa bahya jananendriyaan viksit nahin hoti
 They reside on the site and the sides develop externally
 ninf se purna keet tak kii vruddhi kramik hoti he or pupa nahin banataa he
 The incomplete transformation of this type of transformation and the insect community is called hemimetabola, such as a reed petal
 dimbh us apraudh avasthaa ke keet se bahut bhinn hota he
 No external sign of the sides is found in it
 dimbh ko purna keet banane se pehle pupa bananaa padataa he
 This type of change is called complete conversion, such as in a domestic fly
 atyalp kiton main upariparivardhan hota he
 In these poles, excessive changes in ovum state are also found
 inamen chaar yaa isse adhik spasht instar hote hai
 There is also a lot of difference in their life and behavior
 is prakaar ke parivartan ko hyper roopantaran kehete hai, jaisaa cantharis main
 Regulation of conversion to insects is related to two hormones - the decaying hormone and the infancy hormone
 kentul-patan-kaarak hormone praaia: vakshiya granthi utsarjit karata he
 This makes the derm of the hormone moth
 praudh main vakshiya granthi lupt ho jaati he, isaliye kentulapatan bhi samaapt ho jaataa he
 If the thoracic gland of nymph is deposited in the adult, then the adult will also start to ejaculate
 shishav hormone karpora alata utsarjit karte hai
 This hormone suppresses the symptoms of adulthood and helps in rapidly eradicating the symptoms of nymphs
 roopantaran ke samay vakshiya granthi kii kriyasheeltaa bad jaati he or iske hormone kaa prabhaav itnaa paryaapt hota he ki shishav hormonon ke prabhaav ko kuchal detaa he or is prakaar roopantaran ho jaataa he
 Needs are fluent and very active
 inke shwasaradhran band hote he
 Respiration occurs by the reservoir
 ye campodiiform hote hai, arthath taange bhalee-bhanti viksit or sharir chauras hota he
 Ovum holometabolus and hypermetabolus is an inhomogeneous condition of insects
 dimbh jab andey se nikalate he, tab bhinn-bhinn jatiyon ke anusaar unke parivardhan kii dashaayen bhinn-bhinn ho sakati hai
 Their condition depends to some extent on the amount of yoke, which is present in the egg for their growth
 praaia: aisa dekha gaya he ki jab andey main yoke kii maatra kam hoti he, tab andey se nikalate samay dimbh adhik apurna hota he
 There are four types of ovum, protopods are found in the GV appendages on the ovum, because their eggs have a small amount of yoke
 ye dimbh lagbhag bhruneey avasthaa main hi hote hai
 It is possible to survive because they live either in the eggs of other insects or within their bodies, where they get highly nutritious food to grow
 inke udar main khand yaa kisi prakaar ke avyav nahin paae jate hai
 Polypods or erusiform columns also have clear segments in the body and components on the abdomen
 shringikas or vidyaman hoti hai, kintu choti hoti hai
 They live near their food and are lazy for this reason
 aise dimbh illi kehalaate hai or titliyon, shalbhon tathaa safilaise main paae jate hai
 The thoracic components of oligopod eggs are well developed, but no other components are found in the abdomen other than the caudal component
 ye maansaahaari hote hai or shikaar kii khoj main ghoomte phirte hai
 Due to these active lives, their eyes and other senses develop well
 ye dimbh sthal par rahane vaale kanchukapakshon or jaalpakshon main paae jate hai
 The apodus ovum consists of a worm shape
 inaki taange bahut choti hoti hai yaa purnataya lupt ho jaati hai
 They are found in many community insects, such as domestic fly's eggs
 dimbh avasthaa ke ant ke nikat keet roopaantar kii taiyaari karata he or nishchit roopaantar hone ke purv kii dasha main aa jaataa he
 In this case the insect stops eating
 sharir bahut sikud jaataa he or uskaa rang nasht ho jaataa he
 After the prupupa condition, the body shape of the insect changes
 bhavishya main hone vaale praudh ke netra or taangon ke bahya vikson ke chihn pratham baar drushtigochar hote hai
 Often a Koya is formed at this stage
 dwipakshon main isi avasthaa main pupa kaa khol banataa he
 In the condition of pupa, the insect rests
 isi avasthaa main paksh tathaa anya avyav apane adhicharm kii theliyon se baahar nikal aate hai or pratyaksh ho jate hai
 The internal senses are reconstructed according to the needs of the future pests
 praathmik prakaar kaa pupa decticas pupa kehalaata he
 Its components do not stick to its body, but it can move
 machhar ke pupa jalawaasi hai or chapaltaa se tairte rahete hai
 The sides and legs of the obtect ie, the poached pupa, stick to the body
 inamen pragati nahin hoti
 These types of punas are mostly found in moths
 coarctate pupa main dimbh kii antim kentul kaa patan nahin hota he, kintu yahi kentul kadi banakar pupa ke baahar puparium ban jaati he
 This type of pupa is found in domestic fly
 puparium se nikalate samay keet apane khol kaa vibhinn prakaar se todate he
 Chew-eating insects come out of their jaws by muttering their puparium
 chuskar bhojan karanevaale keet ek taral padaarth kaa utsarjan karte hai, jo koya ke resham ko ek ore se komal kar detaa he or is kaaran sahaj main hi tut jaataa he
 Some scales have thorns on the sides, from which they form cracks in the puparium
 kuch dwipakshon ke sir par ek thili hoti hai, jisamen vaayu bharkar ve puparium ke sire ko dabaate hai
 In this way, this end breaks and the fly comes out
 puparium se nikalate samay keet sabase pehle apane avyavon ko baahar nikaalata he
 At this time, its legs shrink, then creep, it rests in whatever condition it finds closest to it
 pakshon main sharir ke raktapravaah se or peshiyon ke sikudne tathaa failane se paksh bhi shighrata se fail jate hai
 Shortly after leaving the puparium, the insect begins to fly
 purnakit kaa parivardhan apurna roopantaranwale kiton main purnakit ke parivardhan main parivartan kramik or rnivighn hote hai
 They are both external and internal
 rnif kii indriyaan purnakit kii indriyon main parivartit ho jaati he
 Apart from the increase in its size, there are very few other changes
 purna roopantaranwale kiton main dimbhon kii indriyaan or utak pupa kii avasthaa main vibhinn maatra main vilay ho jate hai
 This method is called histolysis
 saath hi saath unke sthaan main praudh kii indriyaan ban jaati hai
 This production of new tissues is called histogenesis
 donon prakaar ke parivartan indriyon kii avicchinnata ko nasht kiye bina hi saath-saath hote rahete hai
 In fact, the making of a full-blown starts in the ovum itself
 sabase pehle purnakit kii kalikas banati hai
 These buds reconstruct all the parts of the future insect that will need it, and also make all those senses which are not found in the egg
 dypaj arthath vruddhi kii roak-anukool paristhitiyon main bahut se kiton kaa parivardhan rnivighn hota rahata he
 In the meantime, if any adverse conditions occur, such as low temperature; So the additions stop for some time, but as soon as the situation improves, the additions begin immediately
 kintu bahut se aise keet bhi hai jinamein bahya dashaayen to anukool prathit hoti he
 But due to certain circumstances, the addition stops
 vruddhi kii yah rukaawat kuch saptahon se lekar kai varshon tak kii ho sakati he
 In insects of different castes, this period is often different and thus changes are delayed
 kintu ant main yah rukawat jeev ne itihaas kii kisi ek nishchit avasthaa main hi hoti he
 This stage can be of the egg, of the incomplete insect, or of the adult, and depends on the species of the insect
 resham k krimi shalab, bambiks morai jo andey sharad ri tu main detaa he unamem dypose hota he
 As long as they are not kept at their centigrade before giving warmth, these eggs do not come off
 samshitoshna or sheethal deshon ke kiton ke jeevanchakra main sheetkaal main sheetanishkriyata pai jaati he
 These days the insect remains lax
 ayanvrutt ke deshon main, jahaan kii jalwaayu sadaa ushn or nam hoti he, kiton ke jeevachakra main sheetanishkriyata praaia: nahin pai jaati or ek peedi ke pashchaat duusari peedi krmanusaar aa jaati he
 Shalabh, which penetrates the root of the reed in Indian moths, becomes dormant in the first week of December and begins to be pupa in March
 pepilio demoliyas naamak titali pupa avasthaa main or pit barre praudhavastha main sheetanishkriy hote hai
 The life cycle of periodical cicida, which is found in North America, takes from thirteen to seventeen years to complete, but there are many drumuca that have a generation complete in about a week
 sabase chota jeevanchakra nanhen nanhen calcid naamak kalapaksh ke kiton kaa hota he
 The eggs of these insects are like parasites within the eggs of other insects and their life cycle is completed in only seven days
 bahut se keet sangitajna hote hai
 Moths are speechless, so their music is musical instrument
 ye keval praudhavastha main hi apana vaadya jaanate he
 Often, the male insect probably produces music to attract the female
 inke vaadya adhiktar dhol ke aakaar ke hote he, arthath in vaadyon main ek jhilli hoti he jisamen teevr kampan hone se dhwani utpann hoti he
 There are two methods of generating vibration
 ek bhaag ko duusare bhaag par ragadkar jo dhwani utpann kii jaati he
 Can compare it to the sound emanating from Bella
 duusari vidhi main keet kii peshiyon kaa sankochan vimochan hota he
 These muscles are attached to the membrane and hence the membrane also vibrates
 is prakaar se dhwani utpann karne kaa manushya ke paas koi saadhan nahin he
 Jhingur, katydid, grasshopper and cicada are members of the famous choir of insects
 jheengur, katedid or tidde ek hi gana ke antargat aate hai
 On one front side of the beetles and catechids, there is a plank similar to the sand, which rubs the part of the other forearm which becomes thicker towards the edge
 katedid main reti baayein paksh par hoti he
 Some beetles use their right-sided sand
 tidde ke pakshon par daate hote hai or pichhali taangon par bheetar kii ore tej kinaaraa hota he
 There is an oval hole on the back of the cicada on both sides behind the sides, on which a membrane remains
 is prakaar ek dhol sa ban jaataa he
 On this membrane, the inner muscles are attached, which produces vibration in it
 dhol main tiliyaan hoti he
 The number of these matchsticks varies among different castes
 machhar do prakaar kaa gaan karte hai, jo premgaan or laalsagon kehalaate hai
 a female gives a message to other females by lusting that she has found a prey to suck blood and they can suck blood there
 premgaan nar ko maithun karne ke liye aakarshith karata he
 The life of a large number of insects depends on flora
 lagbhag prayek prakaar kaa paudha or uskaa prayek bhaag kisi na kisi jati ke keet kaa bhojan ban jaataa he
 It is estimated that about fifty percent of insects do their subsistence from plants
 tiddiyaan or tidde khule main rahakar lagbhag prayek paudha kha jate hai
 Many species of moths, ovaries, saucers and thorns also eat almost every part of the plant, either in the open or hiding it
 ye pattey, stambh, jad tathaa kashtha ke bheetar rahakar bhi apana bhojan paa jaati hai
 Jhalaripaksha, Drumayuka and other makuna of plants suck the juice by piercing it
 bahut se shalab, madhumakhiyaan tathaa inke sambandhi pushpasrav chuusate hai
 Some insects transform the tissue of plants into a strange type of composition, which is called thrush
 in rachanaaon main keet ke dimbhon ko aashray tathaa bhojan miltaa he
 Each plant nurtures many species of insects
 do sau jati ke keet makai par, chaar sau jati ke seb par tathaa ek sau pachaas se adhik jatiyon ke keet chid ke vriksh par nirvaah karte paae gaye hai
 Often, insects of different species are found on different parts of the tree and thus to some extent remain from competition
 bahut se keet apana purna jivan ek hi paudhe par vyateet karte hai
 Insects that live inside the leaves, holes inside the plants, and insect-forming insects live their lives in this way
 inkaa paudhon main pravesh karnaa paudhe kii vishesh dasha par nirbhar rahata he
 Many pests attack many plants, or plants of several species of the same class
 saadharantaya prayek jati ke keet kaa paudha nirdhaarit rahata he, tathaa anek keet nirdhaarit jati ke paudhon ke atirikt kisi anya paudhe ko nahin khate, chaahe unki mrityu bhale hi ho jaae
 Many pests and plants are interrelated
 aise keet paraag or makrand praapt karne ke liye pushpon par jate hai
 While receiving these items, they wreath in ignorance
 pushpon se bhojan praapt karne vaale kiton main praaia: vishesh prakaar kii rachanaayen pai jaati hai
 These compositions help in sucking up Makarandaka from very deep mukarandakoshas
 karmkaari madhumakhiyon main paraag ko ekatra karne ke liye pichhali taangon par paraag daliyaan hoti hai
 The flowers also have color and aroma to attract pests
 kuch pushpon kii rachana aisi hoti he ki keet bina paraag ekatra kiye makrand praapt kar hi nahin saktaa or jab vah duusare pushp par jaataa he to pushp kii rachana ke kaaran iske vartikagra par paraag giraae bina makrandkosh tak pahunch hi nahin saktaa
 Yucca flower and yucca shalabh are very beautiful examples of this
 jo keet vanaspati nahin khate, ve ucchhisht vastuon, anya kiton yaa anya jeevon ko apana bhojan banaate hai
 The cleaning insects live their lives on other abandoned items like garbage, etc
 sadi gali vanaspatiyon se bahut se kanchukpaksh, makkhiyaan tathaa anya keet aashray tathaa bhojan pate hai
 Dung, rotting carcasses of animals and their remains become food of some insect
 kiton kii ye kritiyaan manushya ke liye bahut laabhadaayak hai
 a dietary is a creature that subsists on other organisms, is a carnivore, is in search of its prey and eats it when it is found
 is prakaar kaa vyavhaar vibhinn virgon ke kiton main paaya jaataa he
 Their prey is any other insect, or invertebrate
 aise jivan ke kaaran in kiton kii taangon, mukh bhaagon or samvedak indriyon main bahut se parivartan ho jate hai
 In the behavior of some such insects, obvious changes are also visible
 kuch keet apni taangon kaa apane shikaar ko pakadaney tathaa bhakshan karte samay thaamne ke liye upyog karte hai
 Huntsman kites use their three pairs of legs, and only watery legs and mantids are used in this work
 is kaaran inaki taangon main parivartan paaya jaataa he
 The jaws of the disticus are pointed and forward to catch their prey
 vyadhapatang ke ninf kaa oshth anya kiton ke pakadaney ke liye vishesh akruti kaa ban jaataa he
 The combined eyes of these insects are particularly developed
 kuch apahari kiton kii taange daudane ke liye upyukt hoti hai or kuch tivrata se ud sakate hai
 Many cripples lay their eggs in contact with their prey, such as the lady-bird beetle lays its eggs near Drumayuca
 anek apahari apane shikaar kii pratiksha main chhipe baithe rahete hai or jaise hi unka shikaar unki pahunch main aata he, us par ekbargi jhapata maarthe hai, jaise mantis main apane ko gupt rakhane ke liye pattee jaisaa rang hota he
 Some of the waterway poles make a pit to catch their prey, ants
 paraseete ve keet hai jo anya jeevon par nirvaah to karte hai, kintu unka vadh kiye bina hi unase bhojan praapt karte hai or praaia: ek hi poshak par nirbhar rahete hai
 They often lay their eggs on their nutritious body
 paraseete keet do prakaar ke hote hai-ek jo kasheru k dandiyon par or duusare jo anya kiton tathaa unke sambandhiyon par jivit rahete hai
 The first class insects are the genus Anoplura, Malophaga and Cyphonaptera and belong to the Hippobosidae lineage
 ye paraseete apane poshak kii tulana main bahut chote hote hai
 The power to bear them develops in the nutrient and due to this their effect is not fatal
 inamen se adhiktar pahya paraseete hai or poshak ke sharir par rahete hai
 Apart from Cyphonaptera, the body of others is flattened from the top down and they stick to the body of the nutrient
 inke pairon par poshak ko pakade rahane ke liye hook hote hai tathaa netra ksheen yaa lupt ho jate hai
 The sides are also often lacking and even if they are, they are very small
 kiton ke paraseete ine gine hi hai
 Apart from Strepsiptus gana, the bee lice, breula, are only other examples
 ardh paraseete kaa vyavhaar apahari or paraseete ke madhya kaa sa hota he
 Initially it remains like a parasite, that is, it does not destroy the nutrient's much-needed senses, but later it behaves like a parasitic and it devours its nutrient
 yah praaia: apane andey poshak ke sharir ke upar yaa bheetar rakhata he
 Its eggs stick to the nutrient permanently and get their food from inside or outside the nutrient body
 adhiktar ye keet dwipaksh vansh kii texnidi or kalapaksh ke paracitica varg main hi paae jate hai
 Their adults are functional and not parasitic
 ardhparasite kaa aakaar poshak ke aakaar kii tulana main bada hota he or yah apane vyavhaar se poshak ko praaia: sadaa hi nasht kar detaa he
 Nutrients are mostly other pests, whose parasites are invaded by eggs or other unhygienic conditions
 praudh keet par kabhi bhi akraman nahin hota
 Pests of the Tachinidi lineage live within the nutrient, but lay the eggs above the nutrient, or away from the nutrient
 bahut se parashrayi kalapaksh bahya parashriton kii bhanti rahete hai, kintu adhiktar aantarik parashrayi hai or apane andey poshak kii twachaa ke bheetar pravisht kar dete hai
 The most important thing in semi-parasites is found in their respiratory system, especially in internal parasites, which respire the oxygen found in their nutrient blood
 kintu kuch aantarik ardhparasite aise bhi hai
 Which receive oxygen directly from the atmosphere
 kuch keet duusare kiton kaa to bhakshan nahin karte, kintu unki ekatra kii hui saamagree ko kha jate hai
 Such pests are called Inquiline
 ye keet saamaajik kiton ke ghoslon main bahutayat se paae jate hai
 a very well known example of this is the wax moth, which lives in the honeycomb and destroys the hive
 volucila naamak chakkar khaanevaali makkhi bhin-bhinaanevaali mackhiyon or barron ke chhatton main rahakar ucchhisht carbonic makkhi padaarthon ko khaati hai
 The insect called atelura lives in ants and when an ant starts giving its inverted food to another ant, it drinks it
 kuch aise bhi keet hai jo apane poshakon ko, unke saath rahane ke badale main, laabh pahanchaate hai
 Some snakebites find shelter and food in the ants of the ants and in turn release secretions from their body, which these ants are very eager to get
 is sambandh kii antim shrenee yah hai kii chitiyaan srav ke badale main atithi kanchukpaksh ko vastut: bhojan detii hai
 This is a beautiful example of mutual benefit
 adhiktar kiton kii prakruti akele hi rahane kii hoti he, kintu kuch jatiyon ke keet niyat paristhiti main apni mandali bana lete hai
 In winter, when the temperature drops very low, domestic flies often gather together
 kuch illiyaan yuthchari hai or ek saath janmi hui sab illiyaan ek hi jaale main ek saath-saath rahati hai, kintu aisi mandaliyaan bhojan samaapt hote hi teetar bitar ho jaati hai or prayek illi swatantra rahane lagati he
 Many insects, compelled by many circumstances, gather to spend summers, to become pupas, and to pass cold
 inamen se ek paristhiti he surakshit sthaan kii khoj
 Due to the nature of living in the circle of insects, they are probably protected from parasitic and parasitic enemies and from adverse conditions
 bhramanakari kanchukapakshon kii jhundon main rahane or kriyasheel hone ke kaaran kuch raksha ho jaati he
 Locusts and butterflies become gregarious during migration
 helictus naamak ekaaki makshika bhoomi main bani hui surang ke mukh ke chaaron or nanhen-nanhen kamare banaati hai
 They keep food and eggs in these rooms, after which they keep protecting them
 yah us samay tak jivit bhi rah jaati hai jab tak andon se makshikaaye nikal na aaen
 That insect, which takes care of its offspring at least early in their life, can be said to be the first class of social life
 bhinn-bhinn virgon ke samjik kiton main bhinn-bhinn vilakshantaayen drushtigochar hoti hai, kintu inaki prayek mandali kaa sabase mahatvapurn lakshan yah hai ki ek hi kutub hota he, jisamen ek nar, ek maadaa or unki santan, yaa ek ganbhat maadaa or uski santan, arthath kam se kam do peediyaan ek hi sthaan par hi mil julkar rahati hai
 Real social life is found in jumbo, bees, ants and termites
 
 There is another type of symbiosis in which an insect sticks to the body of another insect
 jin kiton ke sharir par chipakate hai ve praaia: bade hote hai, kintu chota keet unako khaataa nahin hai, arthath koi haani nahin pahunchaata
 The triangulins of the Miloidei dynasty carry the ovum in their mosses on their bodies
 vahaan ye dimbh unki santan ko kha jate he

 kiton kii ek badi sankhya jal main rahati he
 They mostly live in fresh water, some are also found in saltwater and sea
 in kiton ke bahut se lakshan upyogi hote hai
 The smooth and shining body of many accents reduces water blockage while swimming
 bahut se kiton main jalpravaah main bahane se bachane ke liye vishesh prakaar ke saadhan paae jate hai, jaise kaali mackhiyon ke dimbh resham ke dhaagon ko atkaaye rakhte hai
 The oily secretion comes out from the glands found around the esophagus in the mosquito poles
 iske kaaran in sthanon ke bahyatvak main jalasantrasic gun aa jaataa he or vahaan jal thahar nahin paata
 Therefore, respiration continues uninterrupted
 kuch kiton, jaise paudura acvatika main aise bal hote hai jinke kaaran bahyatvak jalasantrasic ho jaataa he
 Due to this property, water cannot enter the respiratory tract
 inamen bhojan praapt karne ke liye bhi vishesh saadhan hote hai, yatha-odineta ke ninfon main labium kaa ghunghat ek jaal kaa kaary karata he
 Mosquito ovaries have vibrating burruses in their mouths that produce waves in the water and thus the microtubules of food reach their esophagus
 dietiscus kii pichhali taange patavaar ke aakar kii ho jaati hai
 Notonecta and Dietiscus run both of their hulls together while swimming, but Hydrophilus runs his last leg shift
 jirinus naamak kanchukpaksh madhya or pasch taangon se, jinamein bahut parivartan aa jaataa he, tivrata se chakkar lagaate hue ghumta or tairta he
 The eggs of some flies and mosquitoes float by the dominant industry of abdominal muscles
 bahut chote chote polinima naamak kalapaksh, jo jalawaasi kiton ke andon main parashrayi hote hai, apane pakshon kii sahaayta se jal main tairte hai
 The respiratory system of aquatic insects undergoes many changes
 ye trekkia, jalashvasanika yaa rakt jalashwasanika dwaara shwasan karte hai
 Some insects store the air near them and use it when they are immersed in water
 dwipakshon ke corthre naamak keet ke paardarshee dimbh kaa trekkia tantra saim ke aakaar kii do jodi thili si ban jaati he
 These bags act as buoyancy senses
 yah dimbh in theliyon kaa pariman kisi agyaat vidhi se pavirtit k saktaa he or is prakaar jal kii jis gaharaai main chaahe usee ke anusaar aapekshik guru tv utpann kar paata he
 Pests are found all over the world, from the snowy polar parts to the equatorial, warming regions near the equator
 inkaa vitaran anya sab sthaliy jeevon kaa tulana main sabase adhik vistrut he
 They are found in almost all places where vegetation can grow, that is, wherever they can get food
 kiton or anya jeevon kaa bhojan vanaspatiyaan hai
 Paksha is a composition of great importance
 pakshon ke kaaran kiton main athulit vitaransamarthy aa jaataa he, jo anya sthaliy jeevon main nahin paaya jaataa
 The power of distribution gives each species of insects the freedom to survive the intense competition and the impact of rigorous election, which results in excessive congestion in the finite area, but there are many insects whose distribution is limited
 saare sansar main manushyon ke gharon main paae janevaale kiton main telchatta, chaaval kaa suundwala keet, daalon ke keet aadi prasiddh he
 Apart from these, gram flour, potato moth, sweet potato dill and cabbage moth are also found all over the world
 isi prakaar aise bhi bahut se keet hai jo kisi vishesh pradesh yaa desh main hi paae jate hai
 Such distribution depends on many circumstances
 bhojanprapti or prakritik dashaaen nihsandeh bahut adhik prabhaavshaalee paristhitiyaan hai
 Waterborne pests cannot live where there is no water
 vrikshon kii chaal main rahane vaale keet un sthanon main nahin paae ja sakate jahaan vriksh hi na ho
 Natural barriers, such as high mountains, sea and desert, do not allow pests to be distributed from one country to another
 kuch keet, jaise safilise, bandgobhi kii titali aadi samshitoshna katibandh main hi paae jate hai
 Fruit flies, paddy pests etc
 are found only in the epoch
 kuch kiton main jaise tiddiyon or kuch titliyon main, kabhi-kabhi pravajan kii pravriti hoti he or ye sudur deshon tak pahanch jate hai
 But the modern distribution of many insects cannot be interpreted on the basis of the modern state of the earth and climate and therefore often has to resort to geological changes
 spring tail naamak keet newjiland or chile main paaya jaataa he
 From this, it can be inferred that the atactic continent was spread between these two countries at some time, because this insect is so soft and unbiased that it cannot be distributed in any other way
 spring tail kaa anya kiton kii tulana main sabase adhik vistrut vitaran he or is kaaran isane apane ko in vibhinn paristhitiyon ke anukool bana liya he
 Ants are also distributed in almost the same way and they have adapted themselves to different circumstances
 da biar, ne san 1954-55 main yah batalaaya ki miriapoda ke jo dimbh dimbhavstha main janan kar saken unako hi kiton kaa purvaj maananaa chahie
 To prove this, it is important to compare the adult of insects and some of the bones of Miriapoda, for example, that of Aeulus, a millipede
 aiulas kaa dimbh jab andey se nikalataa he, iskaa sir utane hi khandon kaa bana maaloom hota he jitne khandon kaa kiton kaa sir
 The rest of the body consists of about 12 segments, of which the first three segments each have a pair of legs
 chauthaa tathaa inke pechhevaale khand bhi bina taangon ke nahin hote
 But their growth is hindered and they remain very small
 is prakaar yah chah taangon vaala aiulas kaa dimbh ant main lanbaa praudh ban jaataa he, jiske sharir main bahut se khand or bahut si taange hoti he
 If the growth of the legs after the first three pairs of this egg is more hindered and about 12 sections of the body of the egg persist in adulthood, then this organism will be insect-shaped, with the legs behind the first three pairs of legs being either so weak
 That only their remains will be or they will be completely lost
 yah baat bahut hi rochak he ki vastav main aise keet hai jinamein udar par bhi taangon ke avshesh vartmaan hote hai, jaise campodia, jepix or machilis 
 These insects do not have favors, and they contain compositions that have disappeared from other insects, such as gonation of the gonads
 isliye kiton ke vikaas main in kiton ko miriapoda ke dimbhavstha main janane vaale dimbhon or anya kiton kii madhyavaali dasha kaa samajhnaa chahie
 It is also approved by many other arguments that insects originated from figures like Miriyapoda
 atyadhik sambhaavna yah he ki un sab lambey sharir or tongowale jeevon main miriapoda hi kiton ke purvaj hai, kyonki in main kai rachanaayen ek-si hoti hai udaahranarth, malepigian nalikaay or trekial nalikaay
 But it should also be noted that the insects could not have originated from the adult myriapoda, as they have many characteristics and characteristics
 epterigota upvarg adhiktar vividh prakaar ke kiton kaa ek samooh he or us upvarg kaa keval thisaneura gana hi terrigot kiton kii vikasawali mukhya shrenee ke sambhavat: sameep he
 It has been proved by logic that the remaining three gonas of Apertigota should not be considered insects
 kintu aisa koi santoshjanak kaaran prathit nahin hota he, jisase in teenon ganon ko is upvarg se pruthak kar diya jaae, yadhyapi isamen koi andeh nahin ki ye vilakshan rachanaayen pradarshit karte hai, udaahranarth colembola gana ke kiton main keval nau khand hi hote hai
 Anemorphosis occurs in the pests of the protura gana, the diplora, asymptomatic tracheal system found in the pests of gana, the muscles in the flagellum of the genus Dipura and colombala
 upvarg terrigota do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya gaya he-exopterigota or endopterigota 
 Exopterigota Ganes have a close relationship between Epimeraptra and Odoneta, as they are both palaepteron, Ganes
 yadi aadhunik kiton ke sharir ke siddhant se vichaar kiya jaay to blatteria, mantodia, isoptera, joreptra, gailoblattodia, ri jupaj, phesemida, plicoptera, dermaptra or ambioptra ri jupakshika orthoptred, samudaay ke antargat aate hai
 All of these properties form a community due to the following characteristics — unchanged mouthpiece, a pair of mustard on the posterior end of the giant anel lobe in the posterior, numberless malipagian tubules and several distinct tufts in the peritoneal nerve
 in ganon main se blatteria or mantodia main bahut adhik nikat sambandh hone ke kaaran in donon ko saath-saath dicteoptera ke antargat rakhte hai
 The remaining ganas of Exopterigota, namely Socoptera, Malophaga, Cyphanculata, Matkungana and Jallaripaksha, belong to the Matkunganik community
 matkunaganik samudaay ke lakshan is prakaar he: vishesh prakaar ke mandibulate yaa chusanevaale mukhbhaag hote hai, pashchapaksh main anelle lob nahin paaya jaataa, sarasai kaa abhaav hota he
 The number of malpigian tubules is very small, and the peritoneal nerves become almost collected
 ri jupakshik or matkunaganik samudaayon main spasht bhed nahin hai, kyonki joreptra main pakshon kii shirayen kuch ksheen ho jaati he, mailipigiyan nalikaaon kii sankhya bhi kam hoti he or tantrikatantu kii gucchhikaaye bhi kuch kuch ekatribhoot ho jaati he
 There seems to be a clear relationship between Socoptera and Malophaga, as both have eccentric types of hypopharyx
 sambhavat: simonculeta mellophayga se nikat sambandh rakhte hai
 With them, they not only have an analogy in many external and internal creations and nature, but there is also an analogy in the composition of the breath and the process of hatching
 ab prashn yah uthta he ki junon ke donon ganon ko ek hi gana ke antargat kyon nahin mana jaataa
 The reason for this is that there is so much difference between the faces of the two ganas
 ki inkaa pruthak pruthak ganon main rakhana hi praaia: uchit samajha jaataa he
 Considering Indopterygote pests, there is an extreme difficulty in keeping Kalapaksa, Strepsiptera and Kanchukapaksa with other Ganas, hence the rest of them are kept under Panorpid community
 panorapid samudaay jaalpaksh neuroptra ke saath micoptera par kendribhoot he or kuch kuch pruthak kintu sambandhi shakha banaata he
 It is more likely that the lower members of the Mikaptera originated on the one side as the bipartite and on the other side the Salki Paksha and Lomapaksha
 cyphonaptera ke praudhon kii rachana bahut bhinn hoti hai, kintu iske dimbh dwipaksh ke upagan nimetocera ke kuch dimbhon se bhinn nahin hote or yadi cyphonaptera kii utpatti aadi dwipakshon se na hui ho to kam se kam panorapid samudaay se to hui hi hogi
 There also seems to be some difficulty in the subject of acupuncture, ejaculate and strepsiptera
 kalapaksh ke upagan simphyta ke dimbh or panorapid kiton ke dimbhon main sadashya he, saath hi saath simphyta ke pakshon kii shira kii utpatti bina kisi kathinata ke, megacoptaran pattern se prathit hoti he
 For these two reasons, it is also said that the ancestors of Kalapaksha and ancestors of jalapaksha and other panorpid villages were the same
 kanchuk paksh ke vishay main aisa vichaar he ki inaki utpatti anya indopterigot se bhinn rup main hui
 But some authors speculate that the origin of the Kanchukapaksha originated from the ancestors with a nettle shape
 strepciptera praaia: kanchukpaksh se sambandhit samajhe jate hai, kintu kuch lekhak inkaa sambandh kalapaksh ke nirdhaarit karte hai
