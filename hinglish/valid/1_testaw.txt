 Ashwin, who took two wickets in the first session, said, 'I don't think there is a psychological bottleneck in our bowling unit
 aisa do test maichon hua he, pehle sidney or ab yahaan edilade main
 We now have to get two wickets early tomorrow morning
 ’ aswin kaa maananaa he ki bharat duusare satr main ran pravaah nahin roak paaya jisase vah pehla din apane naam karne main asafal rahaa

 The firing broke out in the marriage hall
 With the help of afra-tafri CCTV, the entire case was investigated
 Despite all the strictures in Punjab, the cases of firing in weddings are not being called
 aisa hi ek maamla punjab ke ludhiana shahar se aayaa he, jahaan ek shaadi main maamuli vivaad ke baad goliyaan chal gayi, jisamen do logon kii maut ho gai or ek ghayal ho gaya

 vahiin agar koi chupa kar hathiyaar le aata he to aise main wo kuch nahin kar sakate
 In this case, Punjab Police Investigating Officer Devendra Pal Singh said that the incident is being investigated and the entire case is being investigated with the help of CCTV

 Where the river inside the village is ready to enter in a macabre form

 vajah sirf ek he ki agar pani or tej hua to kisi tarah bhaag kar puure gaanv ko sachet karnaa hoga

 But Lalu Yadav asked the Hathi Bharatiya Janata Party that who is the candidate for your Chief Minister's post, you should mention his name, if you are not telling then it means that your party does not have any candidate

 vah iskaa naam bataa sakati thi or shahar ke duusare hisson se alag ise pahchaan sakati thi
 But until then, it was almost impossible to convince him that all such settlements are part of a city called Delhi, or that both Delhi and Calcutta are part of one country named India
 meri beti ko, pehali baar, bharat kya he, yah tab samaj main aayaa, jab usne skool jaakar nakshaa dekhnaa siikhaa
 Seeing the size of India on the world map, she recognized her country
 ham sabane shaayad isi tarah bharat ko pahchaanana siikhaa tha - ensiiarti kii kitabon main chape nakshon se
 Gradually we also learned to recognize other symbols of the nation - the flag, coins, and other things that we were taught in school
 
 
 
 And after that we learned books, official history
 akbar acha tha, aurangzeb bura
 Prithviraj Chauhan and Shivaji were great
 gandhiji ne ahimsa se azaadi dilaai
 In geography we learned unity in diversity, different languages, culture and dress of different states of India
 mujhe yaad he, bachapan kaa homework, jisamen mohalle kii steshnari shop se kharide hue chart katkar notebook main chipkaana padataa tha
 The chart featured 'typical' photographs of India's famous monuments, freedom fighters, religions and states
 aaj bhi main apni aankh band karke yaad karun to us 'tipical' bengali or tamil aadmi ke, gokhale or tilak ke, akbar or shivaji ke, jantar-mantar or sanchi ke stupa ke haath se banaae chitron ke prints ko dekh saktaa hum
 My understanding of nationalism was made from these pictures and symbols
 tees saal baad meri beti ke dimag main rashtrawaad kaa idia aisi hi 'tipical' tasveeron or chihnon se thos aakaar le rahaa he
 The nationalism of all of us is formed by such symbols, pictures, maps, names
 saath-saath rashtrawaad kii samaj un chizon se bhi hoti he, jo hamase alag hai, jaise duusare deshon kii bhashaaon ke naam, unka khan-paan, unki poshaak, unke sikke
 These are all different types of symbols and symbols, which explain our own and strangers to us

 He was preparing a symbol or symbol for a Pakistani man who was asking for his 'national' cuisine
 biryani kaa yahi pratik tha, jise phir pakistan ko chihnit karne ke liye tab istemaal kiya gaya, jab coast guard ke ek diiji bike loshaali ne kaha ki vah chaahate the ki pakistani boat uda di jaae, kyonki 'ham unhen biryani parosna nahin chaahate the
 
 
 'and that is why VHP said Ved Pratap Vedic's meeting with Hafiz Saeed that' eating biryani with Saeed 'is not patriotic
 aisi baaten biryani shabd ko ek chihn main badal detii hai, jisamen ek khaane kii chiz ko pakistan or aatankwaad kaa pratik bana diya jaataa he, lekin nishane par na pakistan he, na aatankwaad
 The real target is at home - so-called biryani eaters - Indian Muslims
 baar-baar biryani or aatankwaad ko saath jodakar bolte hue biryani ko ek bhayaavah shabd main badal diya ja rahaa he, or shabd ke uccharan se ek chhavi saamne aa rahi he, ek kattar aadmi, jo dharm ke liye desh ke saath gaddari kar saktaa he
 All those people, who are arguing that Nikam corrected by creating the story of Biryani, whether unsolicited, are creating the same image
 hamen in chhaviyon se saavdhaan rahane kii zarurat he, kyonki agar hamane unhen apane rozmarra kii bhashaa ke arthon ko badalane diya, to ek din vah hamaare rashtrawaad kii samaj ko bhi badal sakati he
 This is the matter of February 7, 2009
 colombo ke taj samudr ke swimming pool lounj main ek pareshanhal ladkaa idhar se udhar chakkar kaat rahaa tha jabaki bhartiya team ke duusare sadsy chandani ke ujaale main nahaye khush dikh rahe the
 Although the team had won the series 4–0, there was one match left and everything was yet to start for Ravindra Jadeja
 aise main unki bechaini samaj main aane vaali thi
 Fellow players Suresh Raina, Praveen Kumar and Rohit Sharma confided their problem: "there is some problem with its shoes, only then there is a little trouble
" ’’ unhen vaise bhi team india ke ek bade juute main paanv daalane the
 a promising player from the 2008 Under-19 World Cup winning team had to take a quantum leap towards meeting the lack of a reliable all-rounder in the Indian team
 apane pehle match main aathven number par utarkar jadeja ne naabad 60 ran banaae magar ve ek aise ballebaaj ke rup main prabhavit karne main naakaam rahe jo gendbaaji bhi kar saktaa ho
 In September 2011, after nine months of distance from international cricket, Jadeja was once again new, a bowler who could bat well
 or ab gendbaaj jadeja ne isisi kii van de ranking main agast se ab tak number ek rank par kabiz rahakar bharat ko gauravanvit kiya he
 He is only the fourth Indian to reach the peak after Maninder Singh, Kapil Dev and Anil Kumble
 disambar 2012 ke baad se jadeja kaa iconami rate ascharyajanak rup se 3
 Has been 78
 unhone 22 maichon main 38 wicket liye hai, jinamein se 12 to england kii pichon par lekar unhone bharat ko champions trophy jitaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 In such a situation, it is not surprising that captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is among his favorite players
 jadeja main kuch to khaas he
 He has many nicknames like Revdi, Jaddu, Bapu
 ghode, kabutar, khargosh, machhlee or kute paalane kaa shauk, apni muunchon, raajapootaana vanshavali or duusari keemtee chizon par itaraane kii chaah
 For all these reasons, Jadeja is a character with immense potential, either inside or outside the field
 unki kahani gudadi se laal banane tak kii daastaan he
 Inspiring mother, a one-year ban in IPL due to childish inadequacies for extra money and selling at a tremendous price of $ 6 million at a player auction soon after, can be written a bestseller book on Jadeja's life
 pair main goli lag jane ke kaaran pita aniruddh singh jadeja sena main naukari ke kaabil nahin rah gaye or unhen ek nijee suraksha agency main naukari karne ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 Nevertheless, he continued to dream of seeing the son in army uniform
 par junior jadeja ne goli chalaane kii bajaay balla ghumaakar goli kii tarah gend udaana zyada pasand kiya
 Although the income of a security worker or wife Lataben's nurse's income was not enough for the son's need for English bats and the education of two daughters, the parents realized their happiness in the son's happiness
 jadeja apni maa ke zyada kareeb the, jo unke liye lunch pack karne tathaa unhen match khilne le jane ke alaava unki sabase badi fain bhi thim
 The disaster broke out in 2005 when the mother died due to a severe burn in a kitchen accident
 jadeja ne cricket kariyar khatm samaj liya
 But elder sister Naina took over the responsibility of mother as a nurse
 tab tak ek ubharate cricketer ke rup main unki khyaati jamnagar jile kii seemaa paar kar chuki thi
 He was counted among the probables of India's Under-19 team
 ek baar 2010 main aisa bhi mauka aayaa jab ve baayen haath kii spin gendbaaji chhodie kii sochane lage
 That year, in a T20 World Cup match, Australian openers Shane Watson and David Warner hit six consecutive sixes in their two overs
 bhartiya team main unki jagah khatre main padane lagi
 He made up his mind to focus on batting in the middle order
 2011 ke vishwacap se pehle team se baahar baithe jadeja ko saurashtra ke coach debu mitra ne rasta dikhaaya
 Mitra recalls, "I told him that bowling would help in his return to the Indian team
" ’’ jadeja ne gendbaaji nikhaarane ke liye akele wicket par ghanton gendbaaji karte hue kadi mehnat kii
 In Jadeja's own words, "I felt that i just had to complete the over, keeping the line, length right
" mujhe pataa tha ki gend ko ghuma sakane kii kaabiliyat mujhamen he
 i can also change the flight if the pitch is favorable or if there is a chance
 main shiddat se ek aisa gendbaaj bananaa chahta tha jo das over kaa apana kota puraa kar sake
 i am an all-rounder and sometimes there can be confusion as to what to focus attention on
 magar prectis ke vakt mujhe spasht pataa hota he
 i divide my time into two parts and focus on one at a time
 gendbaaji karte samay main pramukh gendbaaj hota hoon or ballebaaji karte samay khud ko mukhya ballebaaj samajhataa hum
 "maninder Singh, who was the first Indian bowler to reach the top in the order of preference, says," Jadeja the world's No
1 bowler? Many people ask questions
 par aapako yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki unhone ise kar dikhaaya he
 They have not tried to do anything unique and they know their strengths and weaknesses exactly
 test maichon main vishwa stareey gendbaaj ke rup main ve mujhe santusht nahin kar paae hai, lekin acchhee spin gendbaaji kii apni kaabiliyat ke bare main unhone mujhe galat bhi sabit kiya he
 "jadeja's greatest examination is going to happen soon
" dakshin africa ke sambhavit daure main yaa phir newjiland main
 Jadeja's utility in limited overs cricket is well-known on many fronts but he still has to prove his credibility in domestic cricket as he is the only Indian to score three triple centuries in first-class matches
 unki isi uplabdhi ne unhen is khaas shrenee main laa diya or sar donald breadman kii tarah unhen ‘‘sar jadeja’’ kaa khitaab dilvaaya
 Today, he is going to advertise many brands and because of his choice and different interests, he is said to be the next big name of the advertising industry
 rajkot ke bahari ilaake ke 8 acre ke apane vishaal farmahouse main ve amaruud, aam, moongfalee or kapaas ugaate hai
 He loves his glasses and shoes and is very cautious in his clothing
 kesar or ganga naam ke apane ghodon par ve kisi ganwai yuvak ke bhades vaale aakarshan ke saath sawari karte hai
 Then, to check the speed of his black Hayabusa or white A4 Audi car, he transforms himself into a racer boy
 phir bhi apane chashmon or bikes ke saath ve koi anokhaa stant nahin karte
 He describes his comparison with South star Rajinikanth as a mockery of teammates
 kuch chijen sirf rajnikant hi kar sakate hai
 For the rest? Sir Ravindra Jadeja exists! srinagar main shuukravaar ko algaavvaadi netaa yaccin malik ko giraftaar liya gaya

 Conflict continued in the area

 Retail inflation during November in the country 4

 The central government expected retail inflation to be around the 4 per cent figure in November

 Inflation rate in the month of October 58 fisadi kii tulana main november ke ye aankade kendra sarkaar ke liye raahat bhare nahin hai

 Industrial production growth rate decreased to 2 in October

 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat is currently in Ranchi, the capital of Jharkhand
 vah yahaan mangalvaar se teen divasiy daure par pahunche hai
 During this time he guided the new volunteers along with the organization officials
 ranchi mahanagar ke prachaarkon se sangh pramukh ne kaha ki ve shakhaon kaa vistaar karen
 So that the organization can become stronger
 sangh pramukh ne mahatvakanksha khatir sangh ke najadik aane vaale logon ko bhi sandesh diya ki aise log sanghathan main nahin tik sakate
 Those who work for the organization, society and country with a dedicated spirit can stay here
 sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne baithak ke dauraan sangh ke swayamsevakon ko ek prachaar kii jindagi kii mushkilon se avgat karaayaa
 Said that to become a preacher one has to sacrifice a lot
 sadhana kerani padati he
 One has to work for the country by being dedicated
 nae swayamsevakon ko khaas hidayatsangh pramukh mohan bhagwat sabase zyada nae swayamsevakon ko lekar gambhir rahe
 For the first time, the association gives the responsibility of extension to those who become full-time volunteers
 sutara bataate hai ki centre or zyaadaatar rajyon main bijepi ke satta main hone ke kaaran sangh ko yah chintaa rahati he ki kahin sangh ke nae swayamsevak apni mul jimmedaariyon se bhatakkar raajnneetik na ho jaaen
 So Sangh chief Mohan Bhagat told the senior officials in the meeting that before examining the responsibility, they should investigate thoroughly how the background of that volunteer is
 prachaar se bachein, garima banaae rakhenarees pramukh mohan bhagwat ne sangh ke swayamsevakon ko atmprachaar se bachane kii salaah di
 He also advised them to avoid selfie etc
 during the events with a leader or a senior RSS functionary
 kaha ki ek swayamsevak kii apni garima hoti he
 Seriousness is the strength of the volunteer
 unhone sangh ke varisht padaadhikariyon se kaha ki ve apane kanishton se khulkar samvaad karen
 Troubleshoot every issue of junior campaigners
 samvaad se hi nae vichaar saamne aate hai
 The Sangh chief suggested the volunteers to work towards bringing social change
 hyderabad main dalit chaatr kii aatmahatya ke maamle main ek or tathy saamne aayaa he
 The Ministry of Human Resources wrote four letters to the Vice Chancellor of the University after the letter of Union Labor Minister Bandaru Dattatreya
 aaj tak ke paas ye chaaron chitthiyaan hai
 The ministry has also mentioned Dattatreya's letter in these letters
 iske baad dattatreya par sawaal uthanaa lajimi he
 a case of abetment of suicide has been registered against him
 in chitthiyon ke baad hi rohit ko hostel se nikaala gaya tha
 See the letters written in the infographic
 
 
 kendriya mantri bandaru dattatreya ne 17 agast 2015 main kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti irani ko chitthee likhi thi
 The letter was written after an alleged altercation with ABVP President Sushil Kumar during a demonstration by members of the Ambedkar Students Association
 vishvavidhyalay ko bataaya tha- raashtra virdohi raajnneeti kaa addachitthee main kendriya mantri ne likhaa tha ki campsjativaadee or raashtra virdohi raajnneeti kaa addabnata ja rahaa he
 When Yakub Memon was hanged, students of Ambedkar Students Association protested by demonstrating
 dattatreya kii chitthee par karrwai karte hue HRD mantralay ne vishvavidhyalay ko ek panel banane kaa aadesh diya tha, jisamen kuch chaatro ko suspend karne kaa faisla liya gaya tha
 However, the VC withdrew the decision after the students protested
 kehete hai duniya main kahin bhi jaao, kisi bhi desh main, kisi bhi praant main, cheharaa mohara badalata jaataa he, bhashaaen paramparaayen badalati jaati hai, lekin insaan vahi rahata he
 Feel the same pleasure, sorrow, love and hate
 ek jaisi hi icchhaaen, ek shant behatar jivan kii hasarat
 i also believed in going to Tibet
 tibet ke andar se kahin zyada baahar se tibet ke bare main khabaren aati rahi hai jinhen sun, dekh, pard ham is jagah ke bare main apni dharanaen banaate rahe hai
 Yes me too tibet jaaoongi kabhi ye sochaa zarur tha, lekin ye un ichchhaaon kii tarah hi tha jinke bare main ham ye bhi sochate hai ki ye to kabhi hone vaala nahin
 And you will get to report there, i never even thought of it in my dream
 dilli ke chini duutavas ke adhikariyon se jab bhi baatcheet hui tibet kaa zikr zarur aayaa or har baar unhone ye hi kaha ki aap khud jaakar dekhen
 What we generally think of Tibet is a very beautiful place
 do, china ne is par kabza kiya he or tibetiyon kii haalat behad kharaab he
 In many places Buddhist monks have burnt themselves, in protest
 teen, aise halaat main 14wein dalai lamas ko tibet chhod bharat main sharan leni padi
 Tibet's exiled government runs in Dharamshala
 lekin bharat ab tibet ko china kaa hissaa maanata he
 When we got permission to go to Tibet, all these things were in mind and we asked many times if there was any restriction on reporting of anything, the answer did not come
 aap samaj sakate hai ki mere man main kitni tarah kii baaten gum rahi hongin kyonki jab tak main or mere sahyogi umashankar singh beijing jane vaale hawaii jahaaz main baith nahin gaye
 i could not believe that we would be able to go to Tibet
 agle din beijing se chaar ghante kii udaan ke baad ham tibet kii dharti par the
 Even though the checking at the airport was overwhelming, the crowd of people who saw it was telling that either the preconceived assumptions were wrong or the situation had changed
 beijing kii dilli jaisi garmi or umas ham dekh chuke the or chini logon kaa tantaa samaj main aa rahaa tha
 Europeans were also in good numbers
 aksar kisi bhi jagah ke halaat saamaanya hone kaa barometer hota he, sailaaniyon kaa aana
 Lahsa had been constantly listening to, even studying, before leaving, but our first stop was Shannon Prefecture
 jis chiz main antar kaa sabase pehle ehsaas hota he wo he, sadakon kii haalat
 Gleaming sunshine and gleaming clear good roads
 man main chalata rahaa ki apane desh main isi ek chiz ko dekh-dekh kar ham kitna kudhate, chidhate, pakate rahete hai
 Well we went to a village first in Shanan
 tibet kii jansankhya kam he, isliye aisa nahin he ki har jagah bheed nazar aati he, lekin jaisaa hamaare yahan choti jagahon main hota he, camera kautuhal jagaata hi he
 There was a language problem, but not a feeling
 vaise hi umrdaraj mahilaayein, hansati hui, kuch cheharaa chhipaati huin, kuch camere kii nazar se bhaag nikalati huin
 At the same time, men look at some skeptics, some seriously and some children
 alag tha, agar kuch to gaanv − ghar bade salike se banaae hue khubasurat, tibeti tareeke se banaae hue
 But then the mind said - the Chinese are calling it a model village
 kam se kam itnaa to hona hi tha
 What is it not that this was my first trip to Tibet, so this duality was constantly in my mind whether to obey what is in front or find those who have been listening till now
 aage kii yatra main wo gaanv bhi dikhaa jo itnaa samrudh nahin laga, lekin chini adhikari saaf taur par maan rahe the ki abhi ek tihaai prifecture hi is tarz par banaaya ja sakaa he
 Saw many things besides this
 hastshilp centre jo dekhne main to zaraa sa tha, lekin vahaan kii chizon ko jo keemat milti he, sun kar to main chakra gai
 Comparisons were going on in the mind that what would have happened if such marketing was given such preference
 tibeti chikitsa paddati par abhi bhi vahaan ke 90 fisadi log bharosa karte hai or vaise hi aspataal banwaaya gaya he, paise die gaye hai
 Been looking at Tibet, but the context was like a common citizen of India thinking its own merit
 shanan se lhasa tak kaa safar bhi ankhen kholane vaala tha
 The Brahmaputra River on one side, the high mountains on the other side and the cursory road in the middle - sometimes under open sky, sometimes through the tunnels in the middle of the mountain
 is vishaal nadi ko naman to kiya, par ye bhi sochaa ki aapako bhi saadh hi liya chiniyon ne
 What is more, if not taken care of, despite the challenges faced by nature, the network of trains and roads
 agar aap ye maanate hai ki china ne tibet par apni pakad majboot karne ke liye ye jaal bichaaya he, to ye bhi maananaa hoga ki iske liye paisa pani kii tarah bahaya gaya he or inkaa phayda tibetiyon ko bhi he
 Every picture has two sides
 ham haftebhar pehle hi khule lhasa−shigatse railway line par bhi pahunche
 The 251-km long train line is part of the chinghai-tibet railway line
 abhi vaise to yahan se ek hi train chalati he
 The morning runs from here and in the evening returns from there
 lekin, intazaam aise kii agar sawari sau guna bad bhi jaae to shaayad hi koi dikkat hogi
 Despite all this, one thing that i found very interesting is that this story of infrastructure development does not seem to end here
 jaisaa haal kaamanwealth games ke vakt dilli kaa dikhataa tha, vaisaa hi nazaaraa har jagah dikhataa rahaa or imaaraten or sadaken banati ja rahi hai
 We also questioned the Chinese authorities on this
 poocha ki is tarah kaa nirmaan kya paryaavaran ke liye khatarnaak nahin
 But it turned out that environmental proofs are quite difficult to construct at this place
 tab bhi hairat to hoti he
 On the other side is Lhasa, whose story is completely different
 ek tourist spot sa hi he
 Initiative on the streets
 or shotone festival yani dahi ke tyohaar ke kaaran bhi bazaaron main kaaphi gahamagahami thi
 Before proceeding further, let me tell you that if anyone can compete with Indians in the bargain, then they are Chinese
 is shahar main potalaa pales jo raajnneeti satta kaa centre hua karata tha or jahaan chathe ko chhod kar 13wein tak sabhi dalai lamas dafan hai yaa norbulika jo ek vishalkay baag he or jahaan par 14wein dalai lamas kaa samar pales yaa greeshm nivas
 All have been opened to the common people
 sailaaniyon ke liye ye aakarshan kaa centre to hai hi, tibet ke aam logon ke liye ye aasthaa kaa centre bhi hai
 Even if the eyes shrug something, it does not come on the tongue
 puri azaadi he, yahan aakar dandavat karne kii, agarbatti dikhaane kii or is azaadi se shaayad kuch sukun he, ghaavon par kuch maraham bhi laga he
 And perhaps this is also China's intention
 ek do log tuuti phooti hindi main hamase puch bhi lete hai india or shakl par ek muskaan aa jaati he
 His also ours
 kehane ko or bhi bahut kuch he
 But all those pictures in our special program
 duniya kii chat se

 ? is disheartening
 Why not the Govt wake up by down-sizing the cabinet / their perks / salary? The Indian Army, recognized worldwide for its dedication & utmost professionalism, should be given its due
 Reason of downsizing should be based on facts & figures & should not be arbitrary ?


proud of our Armed Forces, one of the top five larger armies of the world
 
 
 Recent news of downsizing our great Indian Army on the name of “cost Cutting” is not desirable but rather objectionable

 gotascari ke aarope or marpet kii ghatnaon ke baad se rajya main govansh ke kray-vikray kaa silsilaa thapp pad gaya tha
 This caused resentment among the cattle farmers and they were demanding a policy

 The Shiv Sena has once again attacked the BJP for building the Ram temple in Ayodhya
 shivasena pramukhuddhav thakrene bijepi ko 'kumbhakarna' bataate hue kaha ki use (bijepi ko) uthakavyodhyaamein ram mandir banane kii jarurat he
 Uddhav Thackeray said that those who came to power with the name Ram have been sleeping for the last 4 years
 unhone kaha ki bijepi satta kaa laabh uthaa rahi he, jabaki bhagwaan ab bhi nirvaasan main rah rahe hai
 Now every Hindu is saying 'first temple then government
 'thakare ne kaha ki jab babari masjid dhahaai gai thi, tab tatkaaleen pradhanmantri narsimha raav ne kaha tha ki uttar pradesh kii sarkaar or bijepi ne vishwasghaat kiya he
 Now 25 years have passed and we have been cheated by not having built the Ram temple till now
 har chunaav main ram mandir kaa vachan diya gaya, lekin ram mandir waalon kii satta centre or uttar pradesh main aane ke baavjood ram mandir kaa nirmaan nahin ho paaya
 Lord Ramchandra became a forest dweller in his own Ayodhya
 uddhav ne kaha ki jo log ayodhya se shivasena ke conection ke bare main puch rahe hai wo itihaas ko bhul chuke hai
 When the Shiv Sainiks demolished the dome of the Babri Masjid and Tabashivasena Pramukh proudly said that the doers are Shiv Sainiks
 2019 se pehle ram mandir nirmaan kaa shubharambh karounhone kaha ki babari girane ke baad bhiram mandirka nirmaan nahin hua, yah ram or hindutv kaa apmaan he
 He said that the excuse of the court is to pretend that the construction of the Ram temple is not the court, but today's government will do, because you asked for votes in the name of Ram, so before 2019, take out an ordinance and directly start the construction of Ram temple
 edilade main pakistan ke khilaaf bharat ne 76 ranon kii badi jeet darj kii
 With this, Team India retained the record of winning all matches in the Cricket World Cup so far over the neighboring country
 pakistan ke khilaaf bharat kii jeet kaa 'sixsar'is match main bharat ne har department main pakistan ko maat diya
 The bowling was said to be the strong side of Pakistan, but Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina and Shikhar Dhawan took the news for it
 pehle toss jitkar ballebaaji karte hue 300 kaa aankada chuaa
 After this, the bowlers under the leadership of Mohammad Shami never gave the Pakistani team a chance to compete in the match
 world cap main paak ke khilaaf yah jeet kaa sixsar he
 Let's look at the main 6 reasons
 
 
 1
 Pakistan Copacistan had not defeated India in the World Cup till date
 iskaa dabaav paak team ke khilaadiyon par puure match main dikhaa
 Be it bowling or batting, the Pakistani team did not have an edge in the game due to pressure
 isaki shuruyaat toss se ho gai thi
 As Dhoni won the toss and decided to bat first on a flat pitch, Pakistan came under complete pressure
 bhartiya ballebaajon ne bhi aatmavishvaas bharaa khel dikhaaya
 Initially withstood the pressure of the big match and attacked the Pakistani team as soon as they came into the rhythm
 haalanki bhartiya pari ke ant main pakistani gendbaaji lay main jarur dikhi, par yah match jitaane ke liye naakaafi tha
 Something similar was the batting
 301 ranon ke vishalkay lakshya ke saamne paak ballebaaj khulkar khel nahin paa rahe the
 The main reason for this was the accurate bowling of the Indian bowlers
 boleron ne pakistan ko ek-ek ran ke liye tarasaaya
 The result was that his batsmen kept throwing wickets under pressure
 CWC15 indvspak: mahamukaable kaa record book2
 Virat Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan and Suresh Rainacohli's form is poor, don't know
 
 
 shikhar dhawan ko team main kyon rakhte hai? suresh raina to bas ipel main chalate hai
 All these criticisms were answered in a single match
 kohli ne shatkeey pari khel bhartiya cricket phans ke dil ko thandak pahunchaai
 Dhawan told why he is important for the team with his innings
 or raina ne ek baar bataa diya ki unka balla kuch dinon se khamosh tha, par ve ballebaaji karnaa bhuule nahin he
 This trio made a tremendous dent in Pakistan's bowling
 teenon ne milakar bhartiya team ke score main 254 ran kaa yogadan kiya
 After falling for the first wicket for 34 runs, Kohli first managed the innings with Dhawan, followed by a quick run in partnership with Raina
 Ind vs Pak: viraat kohli ne todaa sachin kaa record3
 Speed showed Dum The pace bowlers whose performance on the tour of Australia most disappointed the Indian cricket fans, they were seen in another color against Pakistan
 maidan par aisa jaadu bikheraa ki bowling card kaa najaara hi badal gaya
 Mohammed Shami went ahead and took responsibility and Umesh Yadav and Mohit Sharma also supported him a lot
 mohammad shami ne apane 9 over main sirf 35 ran kharchakar 4 wicket jatke
 Mohit Sharma also turned out to be a miser
 unhone 9 over main sirf 35 ran kharchakar 2 wicket jatke
 And Umesh Yadav broke the back of Pakistani middle order batting by taking two wickets in the same over
 4
 a team like Mahendra Singh Dhoni's leader
 ye kahawat dhoni par khub feet baithti he
 Captain Cool also looked aggressive in the match against Pakistan
 unki ranneeti spasht thi
 Knowing that our bowling is weak, they decided to bat first
 yani ballebaajon par bharosa to dikhaaya hi, saath main gendbaajon ko badi bhoomika nibhaane ke liye jimmedaari saunp di
 Never let the match get out of my hand
 pakistani ballebaaji jaise hi dabaav main aae, unhone gendbaaji kram main lagaataar badlaav karte hue pressure banaae rakhaa
 At the same time, Dhoni did tremendous keeping behind the wicket
 5
 Ashwin and Jadeja pair went, r Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja may have taken fewer wickets in this match than the fast bowlers, but their bowling was seen to sharpen, which the team needed
 donon gendbaajon ne bhale hi kul 18 over main 2 wicket ke nuksaan par 97 ran die hon, par middle over main inaki gendbaaji ne hi jabardast kamaal kiya
 While Ashwin bowled 3 maidens from his 8 overs, Harris dismissed Sohail and broke a dangerous partnership
 jadeja ne umr akmal jaise dhakad ballebaaj ko shunya ke score par chalata kiya
 6
 pakistan kii ballebajipich sapaat thi, isliye ran to bananaa pehle se tay tha
 The Pakistani bowlers may have got a lot of runs in the beginning, but they got their team back strongly by dismissing five Indian batsmen for just 27 runs in the last five overs
 aise main daaromadar puri tarah se ballebaajon par tha
 But the lack of experience or the pressure of a big match, the Pakistani batting looked completely inferior
 younis khan jo ab tak middle order main pakistan ke liye ranon kaa ambara laga chuke hai, unka opening karnaa chaunkaane vaala faisla tha
 Apart from this, no batsman wanted to play at the crease
 agar boundry se ran nahin ban rahe hai, to single-dabl par jor diya jaae
 This lesson of cricket was completely forgotten by Pakistani batting
 misbah ko chhod diya jaae, to ek bhi ballebaaj khud ko applai karata nahin dikhaa
 Champion teams take the match to the last over while chasing big scores, but looking at the Pakistani batting it seems that they are not ready for it
 ji haa, aakhirkaar tay ho gaya ki upi main congress kii naiyya paar lagane ke liye uskaa turup kaa ikkaa yani priyanka gandhi wadra siyaasi maidan main hongi
 Also, under a special strategy, his glimpse will be seen in the program related to Indira Gandhi
 aakhir khud priyanka ko indira kii chhavi main dikhnaa pasand he or congressiyon ko unamem indira kii chhavi dikhti he
 Why did Priyanka not miss Indira's 100th birth anniversary? sutron kii maane to priyanka kaa focus puri tarah sirf indira or upi par he
 That is why she will be seen alongside Sonia and Rahul in Indira's birth centenary on 21 November
 indira kii tarah hair style rakhane vaali priyanka kii koshish rahegi ki us din unamem log indira kii jhalak dekhen, usee andaaj main priyanka kaa paridhaan bhi hoga
 After all, the program will take place in the same Anand Bhawan, where little Indira was born
 pike or aaazaad kii koshish laai rangadrasal, congress ke ranneetikaar pike priyanka ko siem ummidavaar bananaa chaahate the, lekin jabgandhi parivaarane inkaar kar diya, tab jaakar pike lagaataar priyanka ko raibareli or amethi ke baahar prachaar karne ke liye manaate rahe
 As soon as he became in charge of UP Congress, the workers of UP Congress demanded Ghulam Nabi Azad to bring Priyanka
 jiske baad aaazaad ne priyanka se baat kii or 'aaj tak' ko bataaya tha ki priyanka amethi-raibareli se baahar nikalakar prachaar karne kii baat par sakaaratmak hai
 By the way, Priyanka herself has already said that when the children grow up, they will think of entering politics and recently they had assumed that now the children have grown up
 ishaare to rahul kii devaria se dilli kii yatra main hi milane lage thepahale aaazaad kaa kahana ki priyanka kaa rukh sakaaratmak he
 Then the big proof came when the leaders of UP Congress got permission to put up the posters of Priyanka Gandhi, that too outside Rae Bareli Amethi
 haa, ye shart jarur thi ki poster main priyanka kaa photo akele nahin hoga or rahul se bada nahin hoga
 5 steps which show that Bhoomikasonia will remain as Rahul's associate and Priyanka herself is taking care that her role should be that of Rahul's associate
 aakhir sabhi ko ehsaas he ki priyanka kaa aana kahin rahul kii chamak par chot naa kar de
 After all, the family has decided that after Sonia, the party's command will remain in Rahul's hands
 1
 Therefore, a condition was placed on Priyanka's poster
 2
 Priyanka also stayed away from all events in Indira's birth centenary in Delhi
 3
 a meeting of the Congress Working Committee was requested to make Rahul the president
 4
 Rahul's Kisan Yatra in UP was organized on a large scale
 5
 In Delhi, the news of meeting only the leaders associated with UP was made public, while Priyanka remains active on all the big issues behind the scenes
 priyanka ke chunavi kaaryakramon kaa elaanupi congress kii prachaar samiti ke pramukh sanjay singh aurapradesh adhyaksh raaj babbar kemutabik abhi priyanka ji ne puure upi main prachaar karne par hami bhari he
 Now his schedule will be made, his role will be final, which will be prepared by the time the election is announced and it will be duly announced after the announcement of the election
 lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab congress ko priyanka ke aane par khojna hoga, jab virdohi puuchhenge ki kya rahul upi main flop ho gaye, jo priyanka ko laana pad rahaa he
 In Gujarat, a temple has introduced a unique solution to solve the difficulties of students who are worried about the 10th and 12th examinations
 yahaan panchmahal jile main sthit kshtbhanjan mandir chaatro kii pareshaani hal karne ke liye ek kalam de rahaa he

 The picture of this pamphlet has become viral on social media these days, where many people are jokingly saying that what is needed to be read now, just play-kudo and Bapuji's pen is there to pass the exam '

 gurugram main cricket ko lekar ek samudaay ke ek hi parivaar kii pitayee ke maamle main gurugram police ab tak ek hi aaropee ko giraftaar kar pai he
 In such a situation, the victim's family is feeling insecure
 vahiin, aropiyon ke gaanvvaalon kaa daawa he ki pehle unke ladakon ko peeta gaya uske baad hi maamle ne tool pakadaa
 Police have so far arrested only one accused, Mahesh, in the case of assault on Sajid's family in Bhondsi area of gurugram on the day of Holi
 shajid ke ghar ke baahar police kii suraksha he lekin phir bhi parivaar khud ko asurakshit mahusas kar rahaa he
 The family says that this house is their dream home
 ise banane main na sirf unki sari jodi hui kamai lag gai balki kai lakh rupee udhaar lene pade
 But seeing what happened on Thursday, they feel that they will have to leave this place
 is maamle main peedit parivaar police kii karrwai par sawaal uthaa rahaa he
 The victim's family says the attackers were so fierce that they attacked what they saw
 ek maasoom bacchee jo dar kar aalmaari main chhip gai, use bhi aalmaari se nikaal kar peeta
 Not only this, Danistha, the family girl who made the video, says that if she does not know that its video is being made, then what would she have done
 video banane vaali ladki kaa kahana he ki unhen jaise hi ye pataa chalaa ki is hamale kaa video banaaya ja rahaa he to wo usapar bhi hamalaa karne ke firaaq main the lekin ladki kisi tarah se batch gai
 The victim's family says that the video of the assault clearly shows how the mob is killing women, people at home, stoning and vandalizing, injuring 15 people including 5 children, not this video If it were, the truth might not have been revealed
 parivaar apil kiya he ki is maamle ko jaateey rang na den
 At the same time, Badan Singh, the head of the village of Nayagaon, who is accused of assault, says that the boys of his village were beaten first in a cricket quarrel, after which the case caught fire
 gaanvvaalon kaa kahana he ki ye cricket ko lekar jhagada he, ise jaateey rang na diya jaae
 We are fully cooperating in police investigation
 unke mutabik duusare paksh ke logon ko ghar chhodane kii koi jarurat nahin
 We are all living in peace
 maa-baap kii jimmedaari ko acchhee tarah nibhaa paanaa sambhavat: is duniya kaa sabase kathin kaam he
 Along with giving a good training to the child, it is also the responsibility of the parents to make him a good person
 aise main kai aise padaav aate hai jab maa-baap ko bachche ke prati sakht hona padataa he
 Many times children feel that their parents are their biggest enemy and sometimes parents also feel that their children do not care about them at all
 ye ek mushkil daur hota he jise kaaphi sooyeeboojh se niptaya ja saktaa he
 Parents never want their child to do anything due to which they have to repent in the future, so they often become strict about some things
 bachche ko pyaar dene ke saath hi unke saath sakht hona bhi bahut jaruri he lekin kuch baaten aisi bhi hoti hai jinhen kabhi bhi bachche se nahin kahana chahie
 1
 jab main tumhaare jitna tha to tumse lakh guna adhik jimmedaar thaapane aap se apane bachche kii tulana karnaa bahut galat baat he
 It is not right to compare your child to talk
 isse uskaa manobal to kam hoga
 You will start seeing him as your biggest enemy
 2
 Every decision of yours is wrong, it is right to interrupt your child on his mistakes but never tell him that whatever he does or does is wrong
 isse wo aapse baaten chhipaane lagegaa yaa phir jhooth bolnaa shuru kar degaa
 3
 tum apane bhai-bahan jaise kyon nahin ho?bachche kii tulana usee ke chote yaa bade bhai-bahan se karnaa sahi nahin he
 By doing this, the child will start considering his own siblings as his enemies
 4
 Leave me alone don't even say this to the child by mistake
 aapke aisa kehane par wo khud ko upekshit mahasoos kar saktaa he yaa ye bhi ho saktaa he ki wo depressant main chalaa jaae
 He may feel that no one is going to listen to him
 5
 We had to be ashamed of you because this sentence you said can hurt your child's self-esteem
 wo depressant main bhi ja saktaa he
 6
 apane doston kaa saath chhod dohar bachche ke liye uske dost bahut khaas hote hai
 In such a situation, if you tell a child that his friends are bad and he should stop living with them, then this can make your child sad
