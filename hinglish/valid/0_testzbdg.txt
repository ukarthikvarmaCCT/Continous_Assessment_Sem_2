 Contrary to its colloquial meaning, 'investment' in GDP does not mean the purchase of financial products
 vittiya utpaadon ke kray ko 'bachat' ke rup main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, nivesh ke rup main nahin
 The distinction is clear: if money is converted into goods or services, it is investment; But, if you buy a bond or a share of a stock, this transfer payment is set aside from GDP
 to stock or band paroksh rup se GDP ko prabhavit karte hai
 Although such purchases are commonly called investments, from a total economic point of view it is simply an exchange of contracts and not a part of actual production or GDP
 isamen koi hastantaran bhugtan jaise saamaajik suraksha yaa berogari ke laabh shaamil nahin hai
 Examples of C, I, g and NX: If you spend money to renovate your hotel, so that rates of occupancy increase, it is a private investment, but if you buy shares in a consortium to do the same It is a saving
 GDP ke maapan ke dauraan pehle vaala kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, baad vaale kaa nahin
 But, when the union makes its own spending on renewal, this expenditure will be included in GDP
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ek hotel nijee ghar he, tab navinikaran vyay ko upbhog mana jayega, lekin yadi ek sarkari agency hotel ko naagarik sevaao ke ek karyaalay main badal rahi he, to navinikaran vyay ko saarvjaanik kshetra vyay kaa ek bhaag mana jayega
 If the renewal involves the purchase of a chandelier from abroad, the expenditure is also calculated as an increase in imports, so that the value of NX falls and total GDP is affected by purchasing
 yadi ek gharelu nirmaataa ko ek videshi hotel ke liye jhumar banane ke liye bhugtan kiya jaataa he, to sthiti vipareet hogi or bhugtan kii gananaa NX main kii jaaegi 
 phir se, GDP vyay ke madhyam se utpaadan kaa maapan karata he; yadi utpann jhumar ko domestic rup se karidaa gaya he, to ise GDP aankadon main shaamil kiya gaya hoga, jab ek upabhokta yaa vyaper ke dwaara ise karidaa gaya he, lekin kyonki iskaa niryaat kiya gaya tha to gharelu rup se utpann raashi ko dene ke liye gharelu rup se upbhog kii gai raashi ko "thik" karnaa jaruri he

 vaastavik GDP vruddhi kii gananaa karne se arthshaastriyon ko yah nirdhaarit karne main madad milti he ki mudra kii kray kshamta main parivartan se aprabhavit rahete hue, utpaadan kam hua he yaa badhaa he
 Another way to measure GDP is to measure the total income payable in GDP income accounts
 is sthiti main, kabhi kabhi sakal gharelu utpaada ke bajaay sakal gharelu aay kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 By this, the same figures should be obtained which are obtained in the above expenditure method
 = GDP 
 vyavhaar main, haalanki, jab rashtriya sankhyikeey agenciyon ne report di to maapan truti kii vajah se donon aankadon kaa maapan halkaa sa alag paaya gaya
 Using the income approach, the formula for measured GDP is called GDP, which is: isamen aksar adhikansh chote vyavsaay shaamil hai
 The sum total of COE, GOS and GMI is called total factor income and it calculates the value of GDP at factor values
 buniyadi keemton or antim keemton ke bich kaa antar kul kar or sabsidiyaan hai jinhen sarkaar ne utpaadan par lagu kiya he yaa bhugtan kiya he
 So adding subsidy-free tax on imports and production converts GDP to GDP at factor cost
 ek anya sutara is prakaar se likhaa ja saktaa he: : Where r = rent i = interest p = profit SA = statistical adjustment w = wages GDP ko sakal rashtriya utpaada, ke vipareet mana ja saktaa he, jiskaa upyog sanyukt rajya america ne 1992 tak apane rashtriya khaaton main kiya
 The difference is that GNP consists of net foreign income rather than net exports and imports

 It is the market value of the total out put generated in a nation in a year
 GDP is baat par dhyaan detaa he ki out put kahan utpann ho rahaa he, is baat par nahin ki ise koun utpann kar rahaa he
 GDP measures all domestic products irrespective of their nationality of production units
 iske vipareet, GNP ek kshetra kii 'rashtriyata' ke dwaara utpann out put ke maan kaa maapan karata he
 GNP pays attention to who owns the production
 udhaaharan ke liye, sanyukt rajya america main, GNP america companiyon dwaara utpaadit out put ke maan kaa maapan karata he chaahe ye companiyaan kahin par bhi sthit hon

 adhik jaankaree ke liye dekhen rashtriya aay or utpaadan ke maapan Per capita GDP is not a measure of standard of living in an economy
 haalanki, aksar ise is prakaar ke sanketak ke rup main prayukt kiya jaataa he, is tark par ki sabhi naagarik apane desh ke bade hue aarthik utpaadan kaa laabh praapt karenge
 Similarly, GDP is not a measure of personal income per capita
 ek desh ke adhikansh nagarikon kii aay main kami aane par yaa an-anupaatik rup se parivartan hone par bhi GDP main vruddhi ho sakati he
 For example, in the US between 1990 and 2006, the income of individual workers in private industries and services increased by 0
5% per year, while GDP increased by 3
6% per year during the same period
 jivan str ke ek sanketak ke rup main prati vyakti GDP kaa pramukh laabh he ki ise baar baar, lagaataar or vyapak rup se mapa jaataa he; baar baar kaa arth he ki adhikansh desh GDP par jaankaree tremasik aadhaar par uplabdh karaate hai, vyapak rup se arthath isamen GDP kaa kuch maap duniya ke har desh ke liye praayogic rup se uplabdh hota he or lagaataar arthath GDP ke bheetar prayukt takneekee paribhaashaayen, deshon ke bich tulanaatmak rup se sthir rahati hai or isliye yah vishwaas bana rahata he ki prayek desh main samaan maapan kiya ja rahaa he
 a major disadvantage of using GDP as an indicator of standard of living is that it is not strictly a measure of standard of living
 GDP ek desh main aarthik gatividhi ke kisi vishisht prakaar kaa maapan karata he
 According to the definition of GDP, it is not necessary to measure the standard of living
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek charam udhaaharan main, ek desh jisane apane 100 pratishat utpaadan kaa niryaat kiya or kuch bhi aayaat nahin kiya to bhi uskaa GDP ucch hoga, lekin jivan str bahut hi nimna hoga
 The use of GDP does not argue that it is a good indicator of standard of living, but is instead that living standards tend to rise in the event that GDP per capita rises
 yah GDP ko jivan str ke pratyaksh maap ke bajaay use iskaa pratinidhi banataa he
 Per capita GDP can be seen as a representative of labor productivity
 jaise jaise shramikon kii utpaadakta badhati he, karmchaariyon ko unke liye adhik mazdooree dekar pratispardhaa kerani chahie
 Conversely, if productivity is low, wages must be reduced or businesses will not be able to make a profit

 is kaaran se, aam taur par kai deshon kii tulana karne vaale arthshaastri kai prakaar kii vastuon se yukt tokari kaa prayog karte hai
 This type of adjustment for an exchange rate is controversial because it is difficult to find comparable baskets of goods to compare purchasing capacity in countries

 In reality, however, building this pyramid will divert real wealth from wealth-producing activities, By which the production of property will be transferred

 Despite being the master of these two major advocates of the Marxist historiography tradition, Basham himself was not a supporter of this tradition

 vaigyanik nazariye se bhediya canidaye pashu parivaar kaa sabase bade sharir vaala sadsy he
 Once upon a time, wolves were found all over Eurasia, North Africa and North America, but with the increase in the population of humans, now their area has reduced much earlier
 jab bhediyon or kutton par anuvaanshiki adhyayan kiya gaya to paaya gaya ke kutton kii nasl bhediyon se hi nikali hui hai, yani dasiyon hazaar varsh pehle pracheen manushyon ne kuch bhediyon ko paaltu bana liya tha jinase kutton ke vansh kii shuruyaat hui
 The wolves live in the families of a male and a female in which they also bear children
 yah bhi dekha gaya he ke kabhi-kabhi bhediyon ke kisi parivaar ke nar-maadaa kisi anya bhediyon ke anaath bacchon ko bhi sharan dekar unhen paalane lagate hai
 The method of hunting wolves is social - they do not hunt alone, but form gangs and hunt for grazing animals like deer-cow
 bhediye apane kshetra main shikhar ke shikari hote hai jinhen manushyon or sharon ko chhodkar or kisi se chunauti nahin hoti
 The concept of time-space or space-time was given by Albert Einstein in his theory of relativity
 According to him, like the three directions, time is also a dimension and in physics it should be seen as four dimensions simultaneously
 unhone kaha ki vastav main brahmand kii sabhi chizein is chaar-aiami dik-kaal main rahati hai
 He also said that sometimes situations arise when different objects experience different experiences in all these dimensions
 dik or kaal kaa sambadh hamaare nity vyavhaar main itnaa adhik aata he ki inke vishay main kuch adhuri si kintu drudh dharanaayen hamaare man main bachapan se hi hona swaabhaavik he
 Poets have narrated serious, vast and beautiful fantasies of problems and periods
 darshan main or paashchaatya manovigyaan main bhi inke vishay main puraatan kaal se soch vichaar hota aa rahaa he
 In Kanad's Vaishika philosophy, the concepts of sky, trouble and time are explained and their properties are also described
 indriyajanya anubhavon se jo gyaan miltaa he usamen dik or kaal kaa sambandh avashya hi hota he
 If the reality of this knowledge is understood, then problems and times cannot be separated from reality
 prayek darshanik sampradaay ne vastaviktaa, dik or kaal, inke paraspar sambandhon kii apni apni dharanaayen di hai, jinamein aikamaty nahin he
 Problems and periods are also related indirectly in mathematics
 at: pratishthit bhautikee kaa vikaas inhen dharanaon par nirbhar rahaa
 When some of the experimental fruits of physics appeared to be inconsistent with these assumptions, then these ideas began to deviate, and Relativism established a new form of problem and time, which has been proved and consequently unanimous by many experiments
 dik tathaa kaal kaa yah nayaa swaroop keval bhinn hi nahin varan samajhane main bhi atyant kathin he, kyonki iske pratipaadan main vishisht ganit kaa upyog aavashyak hota he
 Therefore, where problem and time relationship comes, it will be easier to clarify first from macro point of view, then from micro point of view and finally from physics point of view
 indriyajanya anubhavon se jo dik ke gunon kaa pratyay aata he, usase dik ke vibhinn prakaar maane ja sakate hai
 Perceptions are formed on the intelligence of experiences, and perceptions are formed
 is prakaar swanubhav se dik kii jo dharna banati he use "swa-dik' athwa "vyaktigat dik' kaha jaataa he
 In sensory experiences, many experiences are the same for all individuals, and the phenomenon that such experiences meet is called "real"
 vastav ghatnaon ke samudaayon se "vaastaviktaa' kii dharna banati he
 The senses give experiences of sight, touch, sound, taste and smell, but these experiences are always worthy of faith, it is not so
 prakashkeey sambhram to suprasiddh hai hi
 Even tactile behavior seems to be frequent, as the lair between two teeth is shorter than the tongue
 praaia: aisa hi prakaar sab tarah ke indriyajanya anubhavon kaa hota he
 Therefore, the perception of personal problems from these imperfect experiences is illusory
 maapndand tathaa anya uchit yantron kii sahaayta se indriyon kii maryaadit graahakta badhaai ja sakati he or is prakaar anek ghatnaon kaa bhramanirasan ho saktaa he
 The perception of a problem by measuring in experiments is called a "physical problem"
 maapan ke liye maapndand kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 There are four types of problems related to problems and by considering these four types practical problems of problems are formed
 kisi vastu ke sthal kaa nirdesh jab vahaan kahkar kiya jaataa he, tab dik ke ek swaroop kii kalpana aati he or iskaa arth yah bhi mana jaataa he ki dik kaa astitv swatantra he
 The direction of the site of an object is shown in the "relative position" of the problem when it is "relative" to the other object
 dik kaa teesraa swaroop vastuon ke "aakaar' se miltaa he, jisase dik kii vibhajyata kii bhi kalpana kii ja sakati he
 Looking up at the sky shows the fourth form of the "vastness" of the problem
 in chaar prakaar ke swaroopon se hi praaia: dik ke sambadh main vyaavhaarik dharanaayen banati hai or dik ke gun bhi suchit hote hai
 If the sensory experiences gained from the events are discussed, they have two types
 ghatnaon ke sthanbhed se dik kii kalpana hoti he or unke kram-bhed se kaal kii kalpana hoti he
 Thus problems and periods enter our ideology suspiciously
 dik jaisaa hi kaal bhi vyaktigat hota he or prayek vyakti kii kalganana swatantra tathaa swecch hoti he
 Not only this, there is also a change in the calculation of this self-time and it depends on the health, condition, etc
 conditions of the person, for example, if a person is engrossed in any work, then the time is cut fast
 at: vyaktigat athwa swa-kaal vishwaas yogya nahin rahata
 The period measured by a natural event - day and night - will not be personal and will be the same for all people
 at: aise kaal ko saarvajanik kaal kaha jaataa he
 There are macro divisions of day and night
 inke chote vibhaag kiye jaaen to vyavhaar main kaalamaapan ke liye ve adhik upyukt hote hai
 Hence Prahar, Ghatika, Pal Vipal or Hour, Minute, Second etc
 departments were done
 saamanyat: kaal kaa maapan ghadi se hota he
 Like problems, four forms of time also appear in practice
 kisi ghatana athwa anubhav se "kab?' prashn upasthit hota he or iskaa dik vishyak "kahan' se samya he
 From this imagination, the existence of Kaal is considered independent
 kisi ghatana ke kaal ke saapeksh duusari ghatana kaa varnan karte samay kaal kaa saapeksh swaroop dikhaai detaa he
 The form of time that appears between the two events is similar to the size of the problem
 vaise hi kaal ke anadi, anant ityadi visheshnon se kaal kii vishalata dikhaai dati he
 If we consider the four forms of problems and times, or qualities, then our perceptions about them are called "self" or "personal" or "psychological" problems and periods
 dik tathaa kaal kii dharanaon ko nishchit rup dene ke liye unka maapan karne ke saadhan aavashyak hote hai
 Penalties, tools and instruments of hard materials are used to measure problems
 in upkarnon se lambaai, kone, kshetrafal, aaytan ityadi vastuon ke gunon ke maapan hote he
 The assumptions of the time point, line, plane, etc
 of these measurements are made
 jab anek punraritiyon se ye dharanaayen drudh ho jaati hai, tab bindu, rekha, samtal ityadi kaa sthaan moulik hota he or bhautik vastuen in dharanaon se dur ho jaati hai
 Now the similarity of these assumptions and the fundamental assumptions of Euclide geometry will be clear
 drudh vastuon ko samavisht karke dik ke, athwa vastuon ke, maapan se dik kii jo dharna hoti he use jyamitiya athwa eucalidia dik kaha jaataa he
 It is clear that the properties that are perceived by this notion of problem depend only on the definitions, axioms and imaginations of Euclidean geometry
 dik kii hamaari vyaavhaarik dharna or maapan se nishchit kii hui yah jyamitiya dharna, kramash: hamaari sthool drushti or sookshm drushti ke swaroop hai
 Although this notion of fixed problems on Euclide geometry may seem natural, it needs to be analyzed
 eucalidia jyamiti main kuch paribhaashaayen tathaa kuch swayansiddh tathy die hue hai or inkaa taarkik drushti se vikaas kiya gaya he
 These assumptions are only imaginary and independent
 thodaa hi vichaar karne par yah spasht hoga ki eucalidia jyamiti kaa vyavhaar kii vastuon se koi bhi vaastavik sambandh nahin he
 While developing their original fantasies, they had a mutually rational relationship and created an "imaginary" mathematics, which was the basic objective of this geometry
 is uddeshy main yah jyamiti atyant hi safal rahi
 To make this geometry even more "practical", the definition of "ideal object" is that the difference of its two points remains the same under any circumstance
 maapan dand athwa anya aujaaron kaa upyog isi visheshta par nirbhar karata he
 In fact, by incorporating this "ideal hard object", the form of Euclidean geometry changes and we can now understand it as a department of physics
 kintu vyavhaar main eucalidia jyamiti kaa yah parivartan is drushti se nahin dekha jaataa
 When measuring, the principles of Euclidean geometry for measuring practical objects appear to be accurate
 isliye eucalidia jyamiti ko "vaastavik' samajha jane laga
 From the point of view of practical experience and Euclidean geometry, Newton certainly introduced his problems and conceptions of time and the development of iconic physics often depended on these concepts until the beginning of the present century
 newton ne dik ko swatantra satta samajhakar uske gun bhi die
 According to Newton, the properties of a problem are the same in all directions and at all points, that is, the problem is equidistant, equal and similar
 at: padaarthon ke gun dik main sabhi sthanon par samaan hi hote hai
 The problem is infinite and in Newton's problem is uninterrupted by length, time and speed
 kaal ke vishay main bhi newton ne apni dharna di he or yah dharna bhi us samay ke bhautikee ke vikaas ke anusaar hi thi
 According to Newton, Kaal is also an independent entity
 kaal kaa vishesh gun yah he ki vah samaan gati se satat or sarvatra "bahata' he or kisi bhi paristhiti kaa uske upar koi bhi parinaam nahin hota
 Time is also infinite
 saransh main, newton ke anusaar dik tathaa kaal donon hi swatantra or nirpeksh sattayen hoti hai
 The mechanics of Newton etc
 depended on these assumptions
 yantriki main gati or twaran, in donon ke liye dik or kaal ko nishchit rup dena aavashyak tha or us samay to in dharanaon main koi bhi truti dikhaai nahin detii thi
 Likewise, Newton had such an influence in physics that it was not possible to show doubt on these assumptions
 bolai, lobaatchevsky, riman ityadi ganitagyon ne yah siddh kiya ki eucalidia jyamiti ke kuch swayantathyon main uchit parivartan karne par aeuclidia jyamitiyon kaa nirmaan ho saktaa he
 Although many theories of euclideal geometries differ from theories of euclideal geometry, they are not disqualified
 visheshat: riman ke aeuclidia jyamiti se yah spasht hua ki eucalidia jyamiti hi keval moulik nahin he
 Although euclideal geometries are difficult to visualize, their results are extremely interesting and appropriate due to the logic

 Due to the migration of people of different provinces, religions and castes to Delhi, Delhi was urbanized and a mixed culture was also born here
 aaj dilli bharat kaa ek pramukh rajnatik, saanskrithik evam vanijyik kendra he
 There is no definite reference to how the city was named "delhi", but it is widely believed that it is related to an ancient king "dhillu"
 kuch itihaaskaaron kaa yah maananaa he ki yah dehali kaa ek vikrut rup he, jiskaa hindustani main arth hota he 'choukhat', jo ki is nagar ke sambhavtah sindhu-ganga samabhumi ke pravesh-dwaar hone kaa suchak he
 According to another estimate, the initial name of this city was "dhilika"
 hindi / praakrit "dhili" bhi is kshetra ke liye prayog kiya jaataa tha
 The earliest mention of Delhi is found in the Maha Purana called Mahabharata where it is mentioned as ancient Indraprastha
 indraprastha mahabharat kaal me pandavon kii rajdhani thi
 The first evidence that has been found archaeologically suggests that two thousand years before Christ, humans lived in and around Delhi

 Sambhaji Maharaj waged 140 wars during his short reign and one of the main things in this was that his army was not defeated in a single battle
 unke parakram kii vajah se pareshaan ho kar dilli ke badshaah aurangzeb ne kasam khaayi thi ke jab tak chhatrapati sambhaji pakde nahin jaayenge, wo apana kimonsh sar par nahin chadhayega
 Chhatrapati Sambhaji, at the age of nine years, had accompanied Punishashlok Chhatrapati Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the famous Agra visit
 aurangzeb ke bandigrih se nikal, punyashlok chhatrapati shri chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ke maharashtra waapas lautne par, mughalon se samjhaute ke falswaroop, sambhaji mughal samrat dwaara raja ke pad tathaa panchhajari mansab se vibhooshit hue
 He was appointed to the Mughal cantonment of Aurangabad, along with the Maratha army
 yugpravartak raja ke putr rahete unako yah naukari maanya nahin thi
 But being at the very beginning of the establishment of Hindu Swarajya, and obeying the order of Father Punyashlok Chhatrapati Shri Shivaji Maharaj, he did so much responsibility at the age of 9 but insulting work with patience
 unhone apane umr ke keval 14 saal main unhone buddhabhushan, nakhsikh, nayikabhed tathaa saatshatak yah teen sanskrit granth likhe the
 This sensitive crown prince was greatly damaged by the coronation of Punyashlok Chhatrapati Shri Shivaji Maharaj and some of the people in the Ashtapradhan cabinet established after Hindu Swarajya
 parakramee hone ke baavjood unhen anek ladaayeeyonse dur rakhaa gaya
 By nature, Sambhaji Raje, who was sensitive, could go to the Mughals as per the orders of his father Shivaji Maharaj ji so that he could mislead them
 kyun ki usee samay maratha sena dakshin disha ke digvijay se lauti thi or unhe phir se josh main aane ke liye samay chaiye tha
 Therefore, Punishashlok Chatrapati Shri Shivaji Maharaj ji had sent him to mislead the Mughals, it was a monarchy
 baad main chhatrapati shri shivaji maharaj ji ne hi unhe mughaalo se mukt kiya
 But in this effort, he failed to take his wife Rani Durgabai and Bahin Godavari with him
 punyashlok chhatrapati shivaji shri maharaj kii mrityu ke baad kuch logon ne dharmaveer chaatrapati shri sambhaji maharaj ke anuj rajaraam ko singhasanacin karne kaa praytn kiya
 However, this place failed due to the commander Mohite and on 10 January 1681 Sambhaji Maharaj was duly crowned
 isi varsh aurangzeb ke vidrohi putr akbar ne dakshin bhaag kar dharmaveer chaatrapati shri sambhaji maharaj kaa aashray grahan kiya
 In addition to fighting with the Mughals, the Portuguese, the English and other enemies alone, they also had to fight the enemies under them
 rajaraam ko chhatrapati banane main asafal rahane vaale rajaraam samarthakone aurangzeb ke putr akbar se rajya par akraman kar ke use mogul samrajya kaa ankit banane kii guzarish karne vaala patr likhaa
 But due to the greatness of Dharmaveer Chhatrapati Shri Sambhaji Maharaj and his dependents Akbar sent the letter to Chhatrapati Sambhaji
 is rajdroh se krodhit chhatrapati srisambhaji maharaj ne apane saamanto ko mrityudand diya
 However, he also built the Samadhi of a Samant named Balaji Awaji, whose letter of apology was received by Chhatrapati Sambhaji after the death of those feudal lords
 1683 main usne portugaliyon ko parajeet kiya
 At the same time, he stayed at Sangameshwar for some state reason
 jis din wo raigarh ke liye prasthaan karne vaale the usee din kuch gramastho ne apni samasya unhen arjeet kerani chaahi
 Due to which Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj kept the remaining army with only 200 soldiers and sent the army to Rayagada
 usee vakt unke ek fitur jinako unhone vatandaaree dene se inkaar kiya tha, mogul sardaar mukarab khan ke saath gupt raste se 5000 ke fuj ke saath vahaan pahunche
 This was the path that only the Marathas knew
 isliye sambhaji maharaj ko kabhi nahin laga tha ke shatru is or se aa sakegaa
 He tried to fight, but in the face of such a large army, the retaliation of 200 soldiers could not work and he was taken captive with his friend and sole advisor Kavikalash

 When the pieces of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj were thrown into the river of Tulapur, the people living on that shore gathered them together and added them to the sila, after which they were ceremonially endowed
 aurangzeb ne sochaa tha kii marathi samrajya chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj ke mrityu pashchaat khatm ho jayega
 Due to the murder of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, all the Marathas came together and started fighting

 Based on learning activity or ABL describes a range of educational approaches to teaching
 isaki mukhya parisar prayogon or gatividhiyon ke bare main kuch haath kar rahi he par aadhaarit hona chahie ki seekhney kii aavashyaktaa shaamil hai
 The idea of activity-based learning is rooted in the common belief that children are passive recipients of information rather than active learners
 bachche ko apane swayan ke dwaara pataa lagane kaa avasar pradaan kiya he or ek ishtatam seekhney ke maahaul pradaan kii jaati he to seekhney khushhaal or lambey samay se sthaayee ho jaataa he
 Activity-based learning started sometime around World War II in 1944, when a British man, Dawood Horsbergh, came to India and finally decided to settle there
 unhone kaha ki ek abhinav vichaarak or karishmai netaa the
 He started teaching at Rishi Valley School
 unhone kaha ki british council main shaamil ho gaye or kai varshon ke liye chennai or bangalore main kaam kiya
 After his voluntary retirement he located a site in Kolar district and opened his school, Neel Bagh
 nil baag horseburgh kaa ek abhinav vichaar par aadhaarit he or suniyojit adhigam saamagree shikshan main apni rachanaatmak tareekon ke liye janaa jaataa tha
 With his wife Doreen and his son Nicholas, Horsbergh developed a diverse curriculum involving music, carpentry, sewing, masonry, horticulture, as well as general school subjects, English, mathematics, Sanskrit, and Telugu
 ye shaikshanik saamagree ko vyavasthit namoonay or chitra or hasya kii ek samayik sparsh ke saath, yojana banaai gai
 Later Horsbergh built a grand library in Neil Boy that was accessible to teachers and students
 horseburgh kii is pahal ko baad main abl main agrani he or mile ke pathar main se ek sabit hui thi
 In modern times the ABL was pursued in the Chennai Corporation schools, since 2003, as an effort to provide special schools for children who were freed from bonded labor
 abl ke darshan yah aasapaas ke vaataavaran ke dwaara shuru kii or yah jaanane ke liye ishtatam ke avasar uplabdh karaane se prerit he jab seekhney sabase acha ho saktaa he ki aam dharna main apni purvavritt paata he
 a fearless and freedom to express environment always calls for the best learning outcomes

 The syllabus under the system is divided into smaller units, attractive design study cards for English, Tamil, Mathematics, Science and Social Sciences comprising each a group of self study material
 ek bachche ke card ke ek samooh ke puraa hone par, vah ek mile kaa pathar puraa karata he
 Each milestone includes activities to do a sentence form math and science, or to understand a concept, play, sing, draw, and teach a letter or a word
 bachche ko keval ek vishay main sabhi mile ke pathar ko puraa karne ke baad ek pariksha card tak le jaataa he
 One day if a child is absent, he
 He missed out on what he did
 Continuing from where he left, unlike the old system where the children had to learn on their own
 buddha dharm ke mahayan sampradaay ke anusaar amitabh buddha vartmaan jagat ke abhibhavak tathaa adhishwar buddha kaa naam he
 'amitabh' is the chief Buddha whose Mahayana is recognized in the 'holy Land' branch practiced in Japan and China
 inhen tibet main prachlit vajrayan shakha main bhi mana jaataa he
 According to religious texts, Amitabha Buddha was a Bodhisattva named 'dharmakara' in his countless past lives who did such good work that the wealth of his virtues is infinite
 'amitabh' shabd 'amit' or 'aabh / abha' ko jodakar bana he or iskaa arth he 'anant prakaash'
 It is the intention of this sect that five meditative Buddhas arise through the five actions of meditation of Swayambhu Adibuddha
 unheen main anyatam dhyani buddha amitabh hai
 The names of other meditative Buddhas are Berochan, Akshobhya, Ratnasambhava and Amoghasiddhi
 adibuddha ke samaan inke bhi mandir nepal main uplabdh hai
 According to Buddhists, three worlds have been destroyed and nowadays the fourth world is going on
 amitabh hi is vartmaan jagat ke vishisht buddha hai jo iske adhipati tathaa vijeta maane gaye hai
 'amitabh' literally means 'god endowed with eternal light'
 unke dwaara adhishthit swarglok pashchim main mana jaataa he jise 'sukhavati' ke naam se pukaarte hai

 There is mainly residence of Bodhisattvas, however the power of certain arhats is also considered there

 They automatically see the magnificent body of Lord Buddha with their eyes
 sukhavati anshwar lok nahin he, kyonki vahaan ke nivasee jeev agrim janm main buddharup se utpann hote hai
 In this way, Amitabh's paradise is not just a bhogbhoomi, but it is a joyous teaching center where the creature makes atonement for his sins and makes himself virtuous
 japan main amitabh japani naam 'amido' se vikhyath hai
 The descriptive Sanskrit treatise of the aforesaid heaven is famous by the name 'sukhavati array', two versions of which are found nowadays
