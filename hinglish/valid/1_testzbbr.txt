 Development in the software sector started in India from the '70s

 Fees and taxes on software and hardware payments in India after 1990
 karon ko kam karnaa shuru kar diya
 Software parks were built across the country

 Gradually India's software exports went up
 bhartiya software companiyo ne vishwa bhar me kaaphi naam kamaaya
 These companies gave jobs to the students who came out of many colleges
 shuru me bharat vishwa ko sasta software dene ke liye mashhuur hua
 Gradually, due to inter-national competition, the quality of these companies also improved and they started getting more business than before
 galat nahin hoga agar ye kaha jaye ki software udyog hi vah uddyog he jisaki safalta baad me duusare udyogon me bhi dikhne lagi
 In the '90s a number of multi-national companies also started their offices in India

 From the outside, deductive and inductive methods are in opposite directions, but from the inside they create a deeply dialectical unity that promotes rapid development of the entire system of scientific knowledge
 iske saath hi aagamanaatmak paddati kii simaaon ko, unke parinamswaroop praapt gyaan kii samasyamoolak prakruti ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana chaiye
 The drawback of the arrival method is that it cannot take into account the process of development of the object under study, whereas incorporation is structured according to the historical stages of the conversion of the object under consideration
 isi tarah nigamanaatmak paddati kii bhi apni kamajoriyaan he ki vah buniyadi saamaanya aadharikaon kii kul taadaad tathaa un aadharikaon kii satyata ko pramanit karne kii aakshamata se simit hota he
 The real process of cognition consists of unity of arrival and incorporation
 yah ekta in donon paddatiyon ke faaydon ko istemaal karnaa sambhav bana detii he, isse ek kii kaami kaa asar duusari ke gun se dur ho jaataa he
 Arrival is essentially complemented by incorporation and includes elements of incorporation
 yah vichaaradhin vastuon main ek samaan lakshanon ko sahi-sahi darshane tak hi simit nahin hota, balki unke bich se moolbhoot tatwon ko alag karata he tathaa unke parsparik sanyojanon va sambandhon ko prakat karata he, jo nigaman ke kuch tatwon ke bina asambhav he
 On the other hand, incorporation cannot be converted into a system of reasoning without taking into account the truth and rationality of the initial bases, which is something that is ensured by incorporating elements of arrival
 aagaman or nigaman kii paddatiyon ke upyog kii aavashyaktaa vahaan par hoti he, jahaan praapt soochna ke aadhaar par anumaan lagaakar gyaan hasil kiya jaataa he
 Adept in the use of these methods, on the one hand, helps in the generalization of the facts of events and daily practical work of events, on the other hand, to find concrete solutions to practical problems based on common tasks and propositions
 shikshashastreey aagaman va nigaman kii vidhiyon ke kushal upyog se shiksha tathaa kaam main bahut vyaavhaarik sahaayta milti he
 The pedagogical use of arrival and incorporation differs from the corresponding methods of acquiring projected knowledge in that it aims not to draw conclusions from the foundations, but to move from one unit of knowledge to another, revealing a variety of concepts and propositions
 adhyayan kii hui saamagree ko vyavasthit karne main use aagamanaatmak dhang se bhi pesh kiya ja saktaa he or nigamanaatmak dhang se bhi
 If that material is organized and presented as a transition from different facts to general propositions, then the method used is inductive, and if the presentation of the problem begins with general propositions and later transitions to different facts If done, the methodology used is deductive
 lagbhag sabhi samasyaon ko aagamanaatmak or nigamanaatmak, donon hi tareeqon se pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 The method is generally chosen according to the goals of the presentation, the characteristics of the problem itself, and the characteristics of the people to whom that problem is to be presented
 samasya ko pesh karne kii ek suprachlit, aasaani se samaj main aanevaali vidhi aagaman kii sahaayta se uplabdh hoti he, jabaki pesh kii janevaali prasthaapanaaon ke parishuddh pramaan ke liye nigaman kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Both these methods should be used in the study of dialectical materialism, giving preference to each subject, which enables the learner to understand the contents of the problem more thoroughly and make practical use of the knowledge gained
 saamaanya se visisth kii ore jane ko nigamanaatmak prakriya kaha jaataa he
 As a good example of this, we can see silosism, where the problem is solved by taking the basis of some general rules and using them in special circumstances
