 Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark was born in Mon Repos on the Greek island of Corfu on 10 June 1921, the only son and fifth and final child of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg
 Philip's four elder sisters were Margarita, Theodora, Cecilie, and Sophie
 He was baptized into the Greek Orthodox Church
 His godparents were Queen Olga of Greece and the Mayor of Corfu
 Shortly after Philip's birth, his maternal grandfather, Prince Louis of Battenberg, then known as Louis Mountbatten, Marquess of Milford Haven, died in London
 Louis was a naturalised British citizen, who, after a career in the Royal Navy, had renounced his German titles and adopted the surname Mountbatten during the First World War
 After visiting London for the memorial, Philip and his mother returned to Greece where Prince Andrew had remained behind to command an army division embroiled in the greco-turkish War 
 The war went badly for Greece, and the Turks made large gains
 On 22 September 1922, Philip's uncle, King Constantine I, was forced to abdicate, and the new military government arrested Prince Andrew, along with others
 The commander of the army, General Georgios Hatzianestis, and five senior politicians were executed
 Prince Andrew's life was believed to be in danger, and Alice was under surveillance
 In December, a revolutionary court banished Prince Andrew from Greece for life
 The British naval vessel HMS Calypso evacuated Prince Andrew's family, with Philip being carried to safety in a cot made from a fruit box
 Philip's family went to France, where they settled in the Paris suburb of saint-cloud in a house lent to them by his aunt, Princess George of Greece and Denmark
 Because he left the country as a baby, he does not have a strong grasp of Greek
 In 1992 Philip said that he "could understand a certain amount of" the language
 Philip was first educated at an American school in Paris run by Donald macjannet, who described Philip as a "rugged, boisterous 


 but always remarkably polite" boy
 In 1928, he was sent to Britain to attend Cheam School, living with his maternal grandmother at Kensington Palace and his uncle, George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven, at Lynden Manor in Bray, Berkshire
 In the next three years, his four sisters married German princes and moved to Germany, his mother was placed in an asylum after being diagnosed with schizophrenia, and his father moved to a small flat in Monte Carlo
 Philip had little contact with his mother for the remainder of his childhood
 In 1933, he was sent to Schule Schloss Salem in Germany, which had the "advantage of saving school fees" Because it was owned by the family of his brother-in-law, Berthold, Margrave of Baden
 With the rise of Nazism in Germany, Salem's Jewish founder, Kurt Hahn, fled persecution and founded Gordonstoun School in Scotland
 After two terms at Salem, Philip moved to Gordonstoun
 In 1937, his sister Cecilie, her husband, her two young sons and her mother-in-law were killed in an air crash at Ostend; Philip, then sixteen years old, attended the funeral in Darmstadt
 The following year, his uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of cancer of the bone marrow
 her two young sons and her mother-in-law were killed in an air crash at Ostend; Philip, then sixteen years old, attended the funeral in Darmstadt
 The following year, his uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of cancer of the bone marrow
 her two young sons and her mother-in-law were killed in an air crash at Ostend; Philip, then sixteen years old, attended the funeral in Darmstadt
 The following year, his uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of cancer of the bone marrow
 After leaving Gordonstoun in 1939, Prince Philip joined the Royal Navy, graduating the next year from the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, as the best cadet in his course
 During the Second World War, he continued to serve in the British forces, while two of his brothers-in-law, Prince Christopher of Hesse and Berthold, Margrave of Baden, fought on the opposing German side
 He was commissioned as a midshipman in January 1940
 Philip spent four months on the battleship HMS Ramillies, protecting convoys of the Australian Expeditionary Force in the Indian Ocean, followed by shorter postings on HMS Kent, on HMS Shropshire and in Ceylon 
 After the invasion of Greece by Italy in October 1940, he was transferred from the Indian Ocean to the battleship HMS Valiant in the Mediterranean Fleet
 Among other engagements, Philip was involved in the Battle of Crete, and was mentioned in despatches for his service during the Battle of Cape Matapan, in which he controlled the battleship's searchlights
 He was also awarded the Greek War Cross of Valor
 Duties of lesser glory included stoking the boilers of the troop transport ship RMS Empress of Russia
 He was promoted to sub-lieutenant after a series of courses at Portsmouth in which he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the qualifying examination
 In June 1942, he was appointed to the v and w class destroyer and flotilla leader, HMS Wallace, which was involved in convoy escort tasks on the east coast of Britain, as well as the allied invasion of Sicily
 Promotion to lieutenant followed on 16 July 1942
 In October of the same year he became first lieutenant of HMS Wallace, at 21 years old one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy
 During the invasion of Sicily, in July 1943, as second in command of HMS Wallace, he saved his ship from a night bomber attack
 He devised a plan to launch a raft with smoke floats that successfully distracted the bombers allowing the ship to slip away unnoticed
 In 1944, he moved on to the new destroyer, HMS Whelp, where he saw service with the British Pacific Fleet in the 27th Destroyer Flotilla
 He was present in Tokyo Bay when the instrument of Japanese surrender was signed
 In January 1946, Philip returned to the United Kingdom on the Whelp, and was posted as an instructor at HMS Royal Arthur, the Petty Officers' School in Corsham, Wiltshire
 In 1939, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth
 During the visit, the Queen and Earl Mountbatten asked Philip to escort the King's two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, who were Philip's third cousins through Queen Victoria, and second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark
 Elizabeth fell in love with Philip and they began to exchange letters when she was thirteen
 Speaking, in the summer of 1946, Philip asked the King for his daughter's hand in marriage
 The King granted his request, provided that any formal engagement be delayed until Elizabeth's twenty-first birthday the following April
 By March 1947, Philip had abandoned his Greek and Danish royal titles, had adopted the surname Mountbatten from his mother's family, and had become a naturalized British subject
 Philip and Elizabeth were married in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey, recorded and broadcast by BBC radio to 200 million people around the world
 However, in post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for any of the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations to be invited to the wedding, including Philip's three surviving sisters, all of whom had married German princes, some of them with Nazi connections
 After their marriage, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh took up residence at Clarence House
 Their first two children were born: Prince Charles in 1948 and Princess Anne in 1950
 Philip returned to the navy after his honeymoon, at first in a desk job at the Admiralty, and later on a staff course at the Naval Staff College, Greenwich
 From 1949, he was stationed in Malta after being posted as the first lieutenant of the destroyer HMS Checkers, the lead ship of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet
 On 16 July 1950, he was promoted lieutenant commander and given command of the frigate HMS Magpie
 He was promoted to commander in 1952, but his active naval career ended in July 1951
 With the King in ill health, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh were both appointed to the Privy Council on 4 November 1951, after a coast-to-coast tour of Canada
 At the end of January 1952, Philip and his wife set out on a tour of the Commonwealth
 On 6 February 1952, when they were in Kenya, Elizabeth's father died and she became queen
 It was Philip who broke the news of her father's death to Elizabeth at Sagana Lodge, and the royal party immediately returned to the United Kingdom
 The accession of Elizabeth to the throne brought up the question of the name of the royal house
 The Duke's uncle, Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, advocated the name House of Mountbatten, as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name on marriage; However, when Queen Mary, Elizabeth's paternal grandmother, heard of this suggestion, she informed the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who herself later advised the Queen to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor
 Churchill's strong personal antipathy to Lord Mountbatten, whom he considered a dangerous and subversive rival who had lost India, may have contributed to this
 The Duke privately complained, "I am nothing but a bloody amoeba
 On 8 February 1960, several years after the death of Queen Mary and the resignation of Churchill, the Queen issued an Order in Council declaring that the surname of male-line descendants of the Duke and the Queen who are not styled as Royal Highness, or titled as Prince or Princess, was to be mountbatten-windsor
 While it seems the Queen had "absolutely set her heart" on such a change and had it in mind for some time, it occurred only eleven days before the birth of Prince Andrew, and only after three months of protracted correspondence between the constitutional expert Edward Iwi and the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan 
 After her accession to the throne, the Queen also announced that the Duke was to have "place, pre-eminence and precedence" next to her "on all occasions and in all meetings, except where otherwise provided by Act of Parliament"
 This meant the Duke took precedence over his son, the Prince of Wales, except, officially, in the British parliament
 In fact, however, he attends Parliament only when escorting the Queen for the annual State Opening of Parliament, where he walks and sits beside her
 Contrary to rumours over the years, the Queen and Duke are said by insiders to have had a strong relationship throughout their marriage, despite the challenges of Elizabeth's reign
 The Queen referred to Prince Philip in a speech on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 as her "constant strength and guide"
 During his wife's Golden Jubilee in 2002, the Duke was commended by the Speaker of the British House of Commons for his role in supporting the Queen during her reign
 The Duke of Edinburgh's time as royal consort exceeds that of any other consort in British history; However, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, who died aged 101, was the consort with the longest lifespan
 In April 2008, Philip was admitted to the King Edward VII Hospital for "assessment and treatment" for a chest infection, though he walked into the hospital unaided and recovered quickly, and was discharged three days later to recuperate at Windsor Castle
 In August, the Evening Standard reported that he was suffering from prostate cancer
 Buckingham Palace, which usually refuses to comment on rumours of ill health, claimed that the report was an invasion of privacy and issued a statement denying the story
 The newspaper retracted the report and admitted it was untrue
 In June 2011, in an interview marking his 90th birthday he said that he would now slow down and reduce his duties, stating that he had "done bit"
 His wife, the Queen, gave him the title Lord High Admiral for his 90th birthday
 While staying at the royal residence at Sandringham, Norfolk, on 23 December 2011, the Duke suffered chest pains and was taken to the cardio-thoracic unit at Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, where he underwent successful coronary angioplasty and stenting
 He was discharged on 27 December
 On 4 June 2012, during the celebrations in honour of his wife's Diamond Jubilee, Philip was taken from Windsor Castle to the King Edward VII Hospital, London, suffering from a bladder infection
 He was released from hospital on 9 June
 After a recurrence of infection in August 2012, while staying at Balmoral Castle, he was admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for five nights as a precautionary measure
 In June 2013, Philip was admitted to the London Clinic for an exploratory operation on his abdomen, spending 11 days in hospital
 On 21 May 2014, the Prince appeared in public with a bandage on his right hand after a "minor procedure" was performed in Buckingham Palace the preceding day
 He is the longest-lived male member of the British royal family
 The record for the longest-lived male descendant of Queen Victoria is currently held by Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg who lived to be 95 years, 6 months and 5 days old
 Prince Philip would surpass this record on 15 December 2016
 Philip played polo until 1971, when he started to compete in carriage driving, a sport which he helped expand; the early rule book was drafted under his supervision
 He was a keen yachts sailor, striking up a friendship in 1949 with Uffa Fox in Cowes
 He and the Queen regularly attended Cowes Week in HMY Britannia
 His first airborne flying lesson took place in 1952; by his 70th birthday he had accrued 5,150 pilot hours
 He was presented with Royal Air Force wings in 1953
 In April 2014, it was reported that an old British Pathe newsreel film had been discovered of Philip's 1962 two-month flying tour of South America
 Filmed sitting alongside Philip at the aircraft's controls was his co-pilot Peter Middleton, the grandfather of the Duke's granddaughter-in-law, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge
 He has painted with oils, and collected artworks, including contemporary cartoons, which hang at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Sandringham House, and Balmoral Castle
 Hugh Casson described Philip's own artwork as "exactly what you'd expect 


 totally direct, no hanging about
 Strong colors, vigorous brushstrokes
" In 1979, when Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were guests of US President Jimmy Carter, Prince Philip was approached by White House butler Lynwood Westray and another unnamed butler
 Westray asked him "your majesty, would you like a cordial?", and Prince Philip responded, "i'll take one if you'll let me serve you"
 "oh my God, this had never happened before," said Westray
 "there we were standing there
 i was holding the glasses and my buddy was holding the liqueurs and we looked at each other, and i said 'if that's the only way you'll have it, we'll go along with it
' And the prince served us what he was having, and the three of us had a drink and a conversation
 It was an honour to let him do it
" Over his sixty years as royal consort, Philip has become famous for making remarks that were often construed as being offensive or stereotypical in nature
 Some of them were immediately interpreted as gaffes; but other awkward observations were construed by apologists as merely odd, off-color, and often funny
 In his own words, comments attributed to Prince Philip have contributed to the perception that he is "a cantankerous old sod"
 The historian David Starkey has described him as a kind of "HRH Victor Meldrew"
 For example, in May 1999 British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying, "no wonder you are deaf listening to this row
" Later Philip wrote, "the story is largely invention
 In a private conversation with British students from Xi'an's North West University, Philip joked, "if you stay here much longer, you'll go slit-eyed
" The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were denied unconcerned
 Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go "round-eyed"
 His comment had no effect on sino-british relations, but it shaped his own reputation

 Philip has been a Freemason since 1953
 Philip has held a number of titles throughout his life
 Originally holding the title and style of a prince of Greece and Denmark, Philip abandoned these royal titles prior to his marriage, and was thereafter created a British duke, among other noble titles
 It was not, however, until the Queen issued Letters Patent in 1957 that Philip was again titled as a prince
 When addressing the Duke of Edinburgh, as with any male member of the royal family except the monarch, the rules of etiquette are to address him the first time as Your Royal Highness, and thereafter as Sir
 The Duke of Edinburgh was appointed by King George VI to the Order of the Garter on 19 November 1947, the eve of his wedding
 Since then, Philip has received 17 different appointments and decorations in the Commonwealth, and 48 from foreign states
 The inhabitants of some villages on the island of Tanna, Vanuatu also worship Prince Philip as a god; the islanders possess portraits of the Duke and hold feasts on his birthday
 Upon his wife's accession to the throne in 1952, the Duke was appointed Admiral of the Sea Cadet Corps, colonel-in-chief of the British Army Cadet Force, and Air commodore-in-chief of the Air Training Corps
 The following year, he was appointed to the equivalent positions in Canada, and made Admiral of the Fleet, Captain General Royal Marines, Field Marshal, and Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom
 Subsequent military appointments were made in New Zealand and Australia
 To celebrate his 90th birthday, the Queen appointed him Lord High Admiral of the Royal Navy and Canada appointed him to the highest ranks available in all three branches of the Canadian Armed Forces
 saanchaa:infobox COA wide Philip is the oldest living great-great-grandchild of Queen Victoria, as well as her oldest living descendant following the death of Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg on 5 May 2012
 Through his descent from the British royal family, he is in the line of succession to the thrones of the 16 Commonwealth realms
 In July 1993, through mitochondrial DNA analysis of a sample of Prince Philip's blood, British scientists were able to confirm the identity of the remains of several members of Empress Alexandra of Russia's family, several decades after their 1918 massacre by the Bolsheviks
 Prince Philip was then one of two living great-grandchildren in the female line of Alexandra's mother Princess Alice of the United Kingdom, the other being his sister Sophie, who died in 2001

 Contao is the tool to build a free website
 jo piechapi par aadhaarit he
 It is mainly available in the German language
 granthsuchee se taatpary angreji shabd 'bibliography' se he, jo bahut hi vyapak he tathaa jisaki kisi ek nishchit paribhaasha ke sambandh main vidwaanon main matbhed he
 In 1961, the conference of 'ifla' was held in Paris in collaboration with UNESCO, the question of definition of this word was also considered and by consensus the following definition of the word was finally accepted: 'iffla' dwaara sweekrut ukt paribhaasha main mukhya teen arth shaamil kiye gaye hai : Under this, every type of study of the book in its external form, which leads to knowledge of the history, construction, etc
 of the book, is included
 is prakaar kaagaj kii nirmanvidhi, mudrankala kaa itihaasavikas, chitron ke mudran kii vividh paddatiyaan, granth ke nirmaankaal main kii janevaali vividhi kriyaayein aadi sabhi baaten 'granthsuchee' shabd ke antargat aa jaati hai
 The bibliography is actually a form of catalog, but the two words are not synonymous
 soochiptr se kisi ek pustkaalay yaa sangrahalay main uplabdh sahitya kaa gyaan hota he
 The catalog can be only a list of texts published by a publisher and a list of texts sold by a bookseller
 soochiptr main jo granth sammilit kiye jate hai, unka nunatam vivaran, de dena hi paryaapt samajha jaataa he
 With this only knowledge of the existence of a scripture is available
 soochiptr taiyaar karne kii vidhi bhi saral he
 It is either prepared by looking at the texts or with the help of another catalog
 kabhi kabhi soochiptr taiyaar karne main duusare pustakaalayon tathaa vidwaanon kii sahaayta bhi lee jaati he
 From the description of the texts given in the catalog, a person cannot ascertain under what circumstances a book was printed and if any changes, revisions were made in later editions of that book, then why? granthsuchee kaa kshetra bhi yadhyapi kuch anshon tak simit rahata he, tathaapi uski seemaa ek ore yadi nunatam ho sakati he to duusari ore ati vistrut bhi
 Under the bibliography, a list of texts related to a single author, publisher, printer, subject, period or country can be taken
 yadi kisi pustkaalay main uplabdh kisi ek lekhak, prakaashak, mudrak, vishay, kaal yaa desh se sambandhit granthon; yaa anya prakaar kii granth sadrush saamagree, yatha sabhi prakaar kaa prakashit aprakashit sahitya, panflate, patrapatrikas, samachaarpatr or unamem chhapi rachanaaon ke 'riprint', nakshe, chitra, microfils saamagree, hastlikhit granth aadi kii suchi kisi vishesh uddeshy evam kram se taiyaar kii jaay to use granthsuchee kaha jaayga
 It will not be irrelevant to take an example to make it more clear
 nagariprachaarini sabha, kaashi, ke aryabhasha pustkaalay main uplabdh sabhi granthon kii suchi ko 'aryabhasha pustkaalay kaa soochiptr' kaha jaayga
 If a list of all the texts related to and written by Premchand is available there, it will be considered as 'bibliography of Premchand', although it can also be called 'catalog of Premchand Krit and literature related to Premchand' in Aryabhasa library
 granthsuchee kisi na kisi prakaar kii seemaa se pratibandhit rahati he
 This range can be very wide and very small
 yadi ukt udhaaharan main premchand dwaara likhit tathaa unase sambandhit keval usee sahitya kii suchi taiyaar kii jaae jo kisi ek nishchit avadhi main prakashit hua ho, yatha 1920 se 1930 ke bich, to yah granthsuchee 'premchand' vishay tak to simit he hi, ek nishchit kaal se bhi simit he
 This bibliography, if one wishes, can also be limited to 'premchand's Story Literature: 1920- 1930'
 iske vipareet yadi koi chaahe to sansar kii sabhi bhashaaon main anuvaadit or prakashit premchand krit or unase sambandhit sampurna sahitya ko bhi sammilit kar saktaa he
 In such a situation the limit of bibliography will be greatly increased
 kehane kaa mantavya yahi he ki granthsuchee hameshaa kisi na kisi disha tak simit rahati he, par iske vipareet soochiptr kaa kisi ek vishay, kaal yaa sthaan tak simit hona aavashyak nahin
 The bibliography is also limited in its purpose as compared to the catalog
 vishay evam uddeshy ke anusaar hi granthsuchee main granthon kaa kram rahata he tathaa granthsuchee kii ek mukhya visheshta yah bhi hoti he ki apni nirdhaarit seemaa main vah sarvangasampurna hoti he yadhyapi aajkal kuch nae evam kathin vishyon ke liye keval chune hue sahitya kii granthsuchee bhi sankalit kii jane lagi he
 The second major difference between a bibliography and a catalog is that the library is used primarily by library members or researchers to obtain the required texts or to obtain the necessary briefs in relation to them
 iske vipareet granthsuchee kaa upyog kisi ek nishchit evam simit uddeshy ke liye hi kiya jaataa he
 The name of the author generally and its date of publication can be known in relation to a book, but from the description given in the bibliography, all kinds of possible possible details, such as the author, name, value, number of pages, publisher, publication and Date, size type, version, any important facts related to publication and other similar details are also available
 granthsuchee kai prakaar kii ho sakati he, par iske mukhya rup nimna likhit hai : That is, a list of all the literature published in a country
 is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki kisi desh main prakashit sampurna sahitya us desh kii janata ko bina kisi aapatti ke sulabh hona chahie
 No person or institution can buy all published literature
 at: yah sahitya kisi aisi jagah surakshit rakhaa janaa chahie jahaan sabhi log samaan rup se uskaa upyog kar saken
 This work is possible only by the government of the country
 isi uddeshy se sansar ke praaia: sabhi deshon main rashtriya pustkaalay sthapit kiye gaye hai
 But only this problem is not solved
 pustkaalay main kya kya sahitya sangrahit kiya gaya he, tathaa koi granth he yaa nahin, yah jaanane kaa koi saadhan hue bina pustkaalay kaa puraa puraa upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Secondly, the culture of any country is not so rich that it continues to thrive without taking anything from other countries
 aajkal jab ki vigyaan evam maanavtaa kii drushti se samast vishwa kaa ek sutara main aabaddh hona aavashyak samajha jane laga he, anusandhankartaaon ke liye bhi yah aavashyak ho gaya he ki ve duusare deshon main hui tathaa ho rahi pragati se avgat rahen
 Therefore, it becomes the duty of the government of every country to present a means by which not only the people of the country but also the foreigners also get information about the published literature in the country
 rashtriya granthsuchee isi uddeshy kii purti karti he
 The national bibliography gives details of all the texts of all types and all subjects published in a country
 yah suchi praaia: deshavishesh ke rashtriya pustkaalay main sangrahit sahitya ke aadhaar par taiyaar kii jaati he
 So far, no national bibliography has been prepared in any country, which contains the details of the entire literature published in that country
 rashtriya granthsuchee vastut: isi sadi kii dein he
 Even in a country like Britain, there was no national bibliography before 1950
 vahaan 1950 se british neshnal bibliography kaa prakaashan aarambh hua
 This list is prepared on the basis of the texts received under the copyright law in the National Library - Library of the British Museum
 bharat main 1958 kaa varsh granthsuchee kii drushti se atyant hi mahatvapurn mana janaa chahie jabaki vahaan rashtriya pustkaalay granthsuchee kaa prakaashan aarambh hua
 This list keeps a description of all the texts of all languages obtained under the copyright law in the National Library of India, but it is unfortunate for Hindi and other Indian languages that this list is published only in Roman script
 is prakaar 1958 tathaa uske baad bharat main prakashit sabhi bhartiya bhashaaon ke sahitya kii samasya to bahut kuch hal ho chuki he, par 1958 se purv bharat main prakashit sahitya kii koi bhi granthsuchee abhi tak na to uplabdh he or na tatsambandhi kaai yojana hi vichaaradhin he
 But India should be proud that the publication of national bibliography has started here, while in many countries no national bibliography has been published yet
 yahan ke rashtriya pustakaalayon ke soochiptr kaa upyog keval ve hi log kar sakate hai jo swayan pustkaalay ja saken
 Apart from this, the only other solution is to get information about a bibliography by correspondence
 par ab unesco ke prabhaav evam sahyog se kuch deshon main rashtriya granthsuchee ke prakaashan kii yojanaayen vichaaradhin hai or aashaa kii ja rahi he ki aagaamee do dashakon tak praaia: sabhi deshon main rashtriya granthsuchee prakashit hone lagegi
 In the context of the national bibliography, it is natural to pay attention to the world bibliography
 vishwa granthsuchee ke liye vishwa main 18veen sadi se hi samay samay par anek praytn kiye gaye, par koi bhi praytn safal na ho sakaa
 Keeping in mind the world bibliography, the Royal Society of Britain first started publishing a catalog of scientific literature, but soon this effort had to be postponed
 iske baad ukt soochiptr ke poorak ke rup main rvagyanik sahitya kaa antarrashtriya soochiptr kii yojana bani
 This plan also could run only for some time
 ukt donon yojanaon kii asafalataa se vishwa granthsuchee se sambandhit anek samasyaon kaa pataa chalaa jinaki ore vidwaanon kaa dhyaan saadhaarant: nahin gaya tha
 Despite these two schemes, the Royal Society continues to do something in this area
 koi bhi pustkaalay kitna hi adhik dhan vyay kyon na kare, sabhi deshan kaa sampurna prakashit sahitya vah nahin kharid saktaa
 Anthony Panizzi, the librarian of the British Museum, wanted to keep in this library the best books published in all the countries of the world
 isi uddeshy se unhone vishwa kii sabhi bhashaaon ke shreshth sahitya ko praapt karne kaa praytn kiya par kai kaarnon se ve apane prayatnon main safal na ho sake
 The Library of Congress of America, which is considered to be the largest library in the world, cannot be called a world library
 par vishwa ke bade pustakaalayon ke soochiptr bahut kuch anshon main 'vishwa granthsuchee' kii kami kii purti kar dete hai kyonki in pustakaalayon main vishwa ke sabhi deshon main prakashit upyogi evam mahatvapurn granthon kaa sangrah karne kaa praytn prarambh se hi kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The importance of world bibliography in the modern era can only be gauged from the fact that almost every department and branch of UNESCO is involved in some way in the development of bibliography and to prepare bibliography of various subjects and solve the problems related to them
 UNESCO has set up different committees for this
 vishwa main granthsuchee kii vartmaan sthiti main sudhaar ke uddeshy se 1950 main paris main unesco ke tatwadhan main jo antarrashtriya kanference hui thi, uske sadsy sarvasammati se is nishkarsh par pahunche the ki rashtriya str par prayek desh main 'granthsuchee centre' sthapit kiya janaa chahie, jahaan granthsuchee se sambandhit vividh aavashyak kaary kiye ja saken
 Later, with the help of these centers, the national bibliography can also be published there
 rashtriya str par sthapit ye granthsuchee centre vishwa granthsuchee ke liye neenv ke samaan upyogi honge
 Catalogs can also take the form of a bibliography to some extent
 yadi kisi pustkaalay main uplabdh keval kisi ek nishchit vishay ke granthon kaa soochiptr taiyaar kiya jaay to use kuch anshon tak granthsuchee ke rup main upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 The contents of most of the famous and large libraries subsequently acquire the importance of the subject bibliography
 soochipatron main shaamil kiye gaye granthon kii visheshta praaia: yah nahin hoti ki ve kisi lekhakavishesh kii kritiyaan hote hai, yaa isaliye ki sabhi granth kisi ek vishay se sambandhit hote hai, yadhyapi kuch soochipatron ke sambandh main uparyukt donon yaa koi ek baat sahi bhi ho sakati he
 But the specialty of those texts is that they are published by any one publisher, received at a bookseller's shop or they are in the collection of a library
 par bade pustakaalayon ke soochiptr kaa mahatv granthsuchee ke samaan hota he
 For this reason, the lists of the British Museum Library of Britain, the Library of Congress of America and the 'bibliotheque National' of France are counted in the bibliographic category
 inke sankalan kaa mukhya uddeshy tathaa inamen shaamil granthon kii mukhya samanta keval yah hoti he ki ve kisi ek vishay se sambhddha hote hai
 This bibliography can be in contemporary texts like other types of bibliographies and also in earlier texts
 yah vishad bhi ho sakati he yaa keval chune hue sahitya kii bhi, isi prakaar usamen shaamil granthon ke vivaran ke saath tippanee bhi ho sakati he tathaa nahin bhi
 It can also be published in the prescribed time in the form of a magazine, as a small booklet and also as an independent book
 vishvavidhyalayon kii pathyapustakon tathaa vaigyanik granthon ke kuch parichchhedon ke ant main or kuch mahatvapurn anusandhanatmak granthon ke ant main kabhi kabhi swatantra adhyay yaa parishisht ke rup main lekhak 'sahaayak granthsuchee', 'anya sahitya', 'pathneey sahitya' yaa upyogi sahitya, aadi sheershak dekar kuch granthon kii suchi dete hai
 Supporting bibliographies are sometimes given at the end of important articles published in some paperbooks
 isi prakaar vishvakoshon evam shodh lekhon ke ant main sankshipt granthsuchee di hoti he
 These too should be considered as a form of bibliography
 vishwa ke sabhi deshon main prakashit granthon kii nirantar vruddhi ke saath hi saath lekhak tathaa vishay granthsuchee kii aavashyaktaa bhi badhati jaati he
 The bibliography of almost all famous authors has been published in Western countries
 kuch lekhakon kii to kai granthsuchiyaan alag alag uddeshy se prakashit hui hai
 But the problem is not solved only with the publication of the bibliography
 kis kis lekhak kii tathaa kis kis vishay kii evam kis prakaar kii granthsuchiyaan uplabdh hai, yah jaanane ke liye jab tak koi saadhan na hon, tab tak uplabdh granthsuchiyon kaa puraa puraa upyog nahin kiya ja saktaa
 For this purpose, the compilation of 'bibliographies' has now attracted the attention of Western scholars and many small big 'bibliographies' have been published in European languages
 is sambandh main theodor westerman dwaara sankalit 'e world bibliography ov bibliography' mukhya rup se ullekhneey he
 In this huge book, 84, 403 bibliographies published in the languages of the world give a detailed description
 isi sadi ke aarambh main granthsuchee kaa yah nayaa rup prakaash main aayaa he
 In this way, there is a detailed introduction to published unpublished important literature of a subject
 hindi main bhi is prakaar kii ek granthsuchee prakashit ho chuki he
 In addition to the above mentioned types of bibliography, there are some other types of which are the main indexes and abstracts
 kisi bhi granthsuchee ke sankalan main sarvaadhik mahatvapurn evam aavashyak baat yah he ki uskaa uddeshy spasht hona chahie
 The order of the texts to be included in the bibliography depends on its purpose
 kisi bhi granthsuchee main shaamil kiye janevaale granth nimnlikhit kramon main se kisi bhi kram main rakhe ja sakate hai : Alphabetical order
 lekhak ke namaanusaar, granth ke namaanusaar, vishay ke namanusar yaa prakaashan sthaan ke namaanusaar
 Chronology, vargeekrut, Geographical order granthon ke prakaranusaar
 If the purpose of the bibliography is only to give a description of each book, then it would be appropriate to keep the names of all the authors in alphabetical order
 yadi granthsuchee kaa uddeshy kisi vishay ke itihaas kaa vikaas batalaana yaa kisi prasiddh lekhak ke sahityavikas kaa parichay dena he to sabhi granth kalkram arrangement se rakhe jane chahie
 If readers are to be guided in relation to useful and important texts, this can be done by giving subject indexes in alphabetical order at the end of the bibliography and if the purpose of the bibliography is to tell only which texts have been written on the subject so far
 If and what part is still lacking, then on the basis of any classification method, the entire literature can be put in classified order
 isi prakaar yadi granthsuchee main shaamil kiye janevaale granthon kaa mahatv kisi sthaan yaa bhugolic kshetra ke kaaran he to sabhi sahitya bhugolic kram main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Like bibliography, this meaning is also used in a limited area
 yah arth vastut: mashin yug se purv tathaa mashin yug ke aarambh main prakashit granthon ke liye hi mukhya rup se prayukt hota he
 In modern times, scientific instruments have developed so much, and so much progress has also been made in the field of printing that millions of copies of a single book can be printed without any manual labor, at the same time It is also unlikely that there will be any difference between these copies
 at: aadhunik kaal main mudrit granthon ke 'varnan' kaa to koi prashn hi nahin uthta
 Granthavarna refers not to the content of the book but to the various forms of the external form of the book, its construction and existence
 mashin yug se purv jab granth haath se likhe jate the, is baat kii apeksha hi nahin kii ja sakati thi ki ek hi granth kii koi bhi do pratiyaan prayek prakaar se samaan hogi
 Moreover, their paper could not be even the same, then there was even more inequality in handwriting, painting, paragraphs, 'proof' inaccuracies, margin, etc
 mudrankala ke avishkaar ke lagbhag 100 varshon yaa isse kuch adhik samay baad tak bhi mudrankala kaa vikaas acchhee tarah nahin ho paaya tha
 Even at this time, most of the printing related work was done by manpower
 at: yah swaabhaavik tha ki ek hi granth kii do pratiyon main kuch na kuch antar ho
 Looking at the printed texts of that period, it is found that there is a surprising disparity in composing, makeup, proof, decoration of forms, etc
 in two copies of the same text at the same time and simultaneously
 aadhunik kaal main, jabaki pracheen kaal ke hastlikhit granthon or mudrankala ke avishkaar ke praanrabhik varshon main mudrit granthon ke sangrah kii ore kalaparkhiyon evam saahitiyik sansthaaon kaa dhyaan aakrisht hua he tathaa hastlikhit granthon ke sangraahak unchi unchi keemton par prasiddh lekhakon kii pandulipiyaan or unki pustakon ke praarambhik sanskaran ekatrit karne lage hai, unki suvidha ke liye yah aavashyak ho gaya he ki aisi granthsuchiyaan taiyaar kii jaayan jinamein mul varnan ho
 By looking at this description, the difference between the original and the fake copy can be easily made and the art collectors can not be cheated by cheaters and fraudsters
 kehane kii aavashyaktaa nahin ki paashchaatya deshon main anek dhokhebaajon ne prasiddh lekhakon kii pandulipiyon kii hoobahoo nakal kar tathaa unke granthon ke 'jaali pratham sanskaran' taiyaar kar lakhon-karodon rupye kamaaye hai
 Later on being informed of the situation, the collectors have to leave their hands
 kalapremiyon evam sangraahakon ko jaalsaajon se bachaane ke liye granthsuchee main jo varnan diya jaataa he vah apane aapmen purna tathaa kisi granth kii pahchaan ke liye paryaapt hota he
 For the description of Western texts, the scholars have accepted some special methods of scripture
 granthavarnan vastut: ek prakaar kii sankethik bhashaa he jise keval anbhavi hi samaj saktaa he
 There are different methods and rules for handwritten texts and printed texts
 isi prakaar granthsuchee ke uddeshy ke anusaar granthavarnan bhi kam yaa adhik diya jaataa he
 If the purpose of a bibliography is to prepare only a 'list', then necessary brief description of the texts to be included in the list is given, but if the purpose of the bibliography is to give a detailed introduction of the texts, then from the first page to the last page of the book Full description of, full description of pictures, the main salient features of each page, if the margin, order of paragraphs, composition The number of lines in each page, if there are more or less lines in a page, information about it, description of a line if it starts at a particular place, etc
 
 yadi kisi pracheen granth kii do pratiyaan uplabdh hon to unki bhautik banaavat kii aapas main tulana kii jaati he or yadi unamem koi antar ho tois tathy kaa ullekh 'granthavarnan' main kar is ore sangraahakon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya jaataa he
 The difference between two copies of a single text does not mean that one copy is fake
 donon pratiyon main antar hone par bhi donon hi pratiyaan asli ho sakati hai, kyonki unamem antar hone ke anek sambhavit kaaran ho sakate hai
 In the context of bibliography, one has to consider these reasons in detail and reach a conclusion
 granth kii suchi main is prakaar kaa jo vistrut granthavarnan diya jaataa hai usase kalapremiyon, sangraahakon evam pustakalayadhyakshon ko to suvidha hoti hi he par uskaa upyog yaheen par samaapt nahin ho jaataa
 Literary terms also have some significance of the texts
 granth tathaa isi prakaar kii anya saamagree, jiske dwaara vichaaron ko vyakt kiya jaataa he, praaia: rachayita ke vichaaron kaa sahi praturup nahin hoti
 Sometimes it happens that the writer is unable to find the right words to express his thoughts properly and sometimes he uses such words which mean something else in the view of the reader or listener
 is sambandh main ek anya tathy kii ore bhi dhyaan dena aavashyak he
 If the author himself prints his book or makes handwritten copies of it, then there is often no possibility of any kind of confusion or use of the wrong word, but the situation is different
 lekhak kii kalam evam mastishk se prasut koi granth jab mudrit rup main saamne aata he to uske us rup ke liye lekhak nahin varan kai anya vyakti jimmedaar hote hai
 The literary knowledge of these people is usually zero and they are often ignorant of the subject of which they are preparing
 aisi sthiti main lekhak ke saath puraa puraa nyaay nahin ho paata
 Apart from this, it is sometimes seen that what the writer writes in his original copy, when seen in printed form, its meaning seems to change
 yadi lekhak swayan pruf padhane main kaaphi saavdhaanee rakhkar us sambhaavna ko bahut kuch kam kar de tathaa is prakaar apane vichaaron ko vyakt karne ke madhyam par thodaa bahut niyantran kar le, to bhi yah niyantran sampurna rup se 'trutiheen' hone kaa koi pramaan nahin
 The fact is that the author does not do everything by himself
 swayan pruf padhane ke baad bhi use baad kii kriyaaon ke liye dusron par nirbhar rahanaa padataa he
 Therefore, 'error is due to human', on the basis of this theory, it can be said that there is a possibility of any mistake by other persons even after the writer is very careful
 kai prasiddh lekhakon ne sweekaar kiya he ki unke granth bhautik rup main thik vahi nahin hai jaisi unhone kalpana kii thi
 Therefore, to remove the difference between imagination and reality, a scripture is required
 yathatathy granthavarnan saahitiyik samiksha ke liye sethu ke samaan he
 Before evaluating the subject matter of a book, the reviewer needs to be convinced that the copy of the book he is using for review has been prepared on the basis of the author's original text
 yadi aisa nahin he to use granth ke sabhi sanskarnon kii pratiyaan dekhakar unka aapas main sambandh sthapit karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Because the history of which book is actually an important part of the literature history of its author
 sameekshak kaa granth ke paath kaa itihaas gyaat hona isaliye bhi aavashyak he ki vah us sanskaran kii pahchaan kar sake jo lekhak kii mul pandulipi ke adhiktam nikat ho yaa jisamen lekhak ne swayan koi sanshodhan kiya ho
 The reviewer should also know what new material was added to the text later or excerpts from it, changes, additions made by the author himself or with his permission or by the printer, publisher or any other person
 by
 kisi granth ke sabhi sanskarnon kii tithiyaan tathaa unka kram bhi sameekshak ko gyaat hona chahie
 It is clear that it is not the task of the reviewer to obtain or prepare all such details
 uskaa kaary to keval granthvishesh kii vishaywastu kaa adhyayan kar uske gundosh kii parakh karnaa he
 Therefore, it is necessary to give bibliography in the bibliography to help the reviewer
 3- granth kaa bhautik padaarth ke rup main adhyayan, jaisaa prarambh main kaha gaya he, is arth ke antargat un sabhi vidhiyon evam vastuon kaa adhyayan evam itihaas aata he jo kisi granth ke nirmaan main sahaayak hote hai
 Here the text of the text does not mean anything, the skilled bibliographer only looks at how this text came to be and all the prescribed valid methods of the creation of the text are used or not
 vyapak rup main is adhyayan ke antargat kaagaj nirmaan kii vidhi, vividh prakaar ke kaagajon main antar, tathaa unke gundosh, vividh mudran paddatiyaan tathaa unki visheshtaayen, mudran paddati ke antargat aanevaali vividh kriyaayein, tip ke nirmaan kii vidhi, mudranyantron kii karypranani, jild bandhaai ke vividh rup aadi prayek baat par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 Looking at the above three meanings, it is clear that the first two meanings are complementary because the Grathavanavarna is given in the bibliography itself and there is no difference between the bibliography and the catalog in the absence of description
 tisare arth ke sabandh main vidwaanon ne samay samay par pratwaad uthaae hai or prashn kiya he ki granthsuchee ke sankalankarta ko mudrankala kaa gyaan hona aavashyak nahin
 But when modern scholars have accepted that no person can do bibliography without knowledge of printing
 vastut: granthsuchee ukt teenon arthon kaa samanvay he
 The bibliography is the same in which the bibliography is given according to a certain system
 prasiddh vidvan dow greg ke matanusaar granthsuchee se taatpary granth kaa bhautik rup main adhyayan he, uski vishaywastu se yahan koi sambandh nahin
 Similarly, listing only the list of texts by the opinion of the famous American scholar Dr
 Boers will be called indexing, but if the texts in that list are described as physical material, then it is called 'scientific and methodical bibliography' in the true sense
 should go
 dow boars to ek kadam or aage badhkar aisi granthsuchee ko vishleshnatmak granthsuchee banane ke paksh main he
 They believe that the description of a book is given in the bibliography, its purpose is to find the 'ideal copy' of that book
 adarsh prati se unka abhipraay vah prati nahin he jisamen koi dosha na ho, varan vah prati he jo mudrak ke yahan prarambh main nikali ho, bhale hi usamen paath sambandhi kitni hi ashuddhiyaan kyon na hon
 To get such a perfect copy of 'ideal copy', it is necessary to have a detailed knowledge of the art of printing
 granthavarnan main un sab kriyaaon kaa ullekh kiya jaataa he jo kisi granth ke nirmaankaal main prayukt kii gai hon
 Knowledge of printing activities is helpful not only from the point of view of the original text of a book, but also to know the history of that book
 mudrankala kaa gyaan hone par ek hi granth ke vividh sanskarnon ko dekhakar us granth kaa puraa itihaas batalaaya ja saktaa he
 Physiologically microscopic study of a text is helpful in solving controversial questions related to its text
 iske saath hi saath kabhi kabhi vah aisi baton kii ore bhi dhyaan aakarshith karata he jinpar vidwaanon kaa dhyaan pehle na gaya ho
 It is not only important from the scientific point of view, it cannot be denied from the point of view of research as well
 dow grag ke shabdon main yadi sahitya shabd ko uske simit arth main na lekar vistrut arth main len to granth varnan ko sahitya kaa vyakaran kahana chahie
 Overseas Hindi writer in America
 1696 gregory calendar kaa ek adhivarsh he
 Harish Chandra Mehra was the first winner of India's National Bravery Award at the age of 14
 rashtriya veerta puraskaar kii shuruyaat harish chandra kii veerta ko dekhakar hi armbh kii gayi thi

 It also once referred to the planet Venus in the morning, which is now known as a planet
 tarik kaa matlab sapane main ek aagatuk he
 In Arabic literature, the use of the word appears in many places including most notably the Quran, where Tariq referred to the brilliant stars at night

 The word archaeological excavation has two meanings
 utkhanan ke prayog main bahut si vishisht takneekein uplabdh hai, tathaa inamen se prayek khudaai ke apane gun hai, tathaa inase puratatvvid kii style kaa pataa chalata he
 Due to resources and other practical issues, archaeologists are unable to excavate as and when they want
 These constraints mean that excavations at several known sites have been deliberately abandoned
 iskaa uddeshy inhen aane vaali pidiyon ke liye surakshit rakhane ke saath-saath inke dwaara iske aas-paas rahane vaale samudaayon ke liye inaki bhoomika bhi he
 In some cases, it is also hoped that with the improvement of technology, they will be helped in retesting later and the results will be more beneficial
 kisi puratathvik sthal par khudaai tathaa praapt kalakritiyon kii recording ko hi utkhanan kehete hai
 The presence or absence of archaeological remains can be described with high probability by remote sensing, for example radars that can be seen underground
 vastav main, puratathvik sthal ke vikaas ke vishay main upree jaankaree to in tareekon se praapt ho sakati he parantu sookshm visheshtaon ko jaanane ke liye barame ke uchit upyog ke saath kiye gaye utkhanan kii hi aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Excavation techniques have been developing since the time of finding the treasure, while investigators used to try to find out the full impact of human activities on a site, as well as the landscape in other places as well
 It is located, there was also an attempt to know the relationship with him
 iskaa itihaas khajaanon tathaa kalakritiyon kii ek aparipakv khoj se prarambh hota he jo "durlabh kalakriti" kii shrenee main aate the

 The way its writing is done nowadays is 4 millennium BC
 Did not even exist, a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilizations began writing only after this

 The aristocracy's own interest and view of the world was often quite different from that of ordinary people
 saamaanya logon ke pratinidhiyon dwaara kiye gaye lekhan ke pustakaalayon main rakhe jane tathaa aane vaali pidiyon ke liye surakshit kiye jane kii sambhaavnaaen bahut hi kam thim
 Thus, written records demonstrate the biases, imagination, cultural values and potential fraud of limited individuals, which were only a small fraction of large populations
 isliye, likhit record par ekmaatr strot ke rup main bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The record obtained in the form of material is close to making a fair representation of society, although it is dependent on its inaccuracies such as bias in sampling and differential preservation

 Many people associate archeology with the receipt of such aesthetic, religious, political, or economic funds, and not as a reconstruction of earlier societies

 Stratification is the highest and basic concept in archeology, particularly excavation
 yah superpozishan ke niyam par aadhaarit he
 When archaeological remains are below the surface of the ground, identifying the context of each is necessary for the archaeologist to decide about the archaeological site, as well as the nature and date of the site
 is
 koun se sandarbh maujuud hai or ve kaise banaaye gaye, yah jaanne kaa prayaas karnaa puratatvavid kii bhoomika hoti he
 Archaeological stratification or sequence is the active superposition of the stratigraphy or unit of reference
 puraatatv main, puratathvik sthal kii khoj mahatvapurn hoti he
 More clearly, an archaeological reference is a phenomenon from time to time that has been preserved in the archaeological record
 bhootkaal main gadde athwa khai ko kaatna ek sandarbh he, jabaki saamagree bharna doosraa sandarbh he
 Several references will be called showing many fillings in the section
 Structural features, natural deposits and burial of corpses will also be references
 kisi sthal ko in buniyadi, asatat ikaayiyon main vargeekrut karne se puratatvvid gatividhiyon ke kalkram ko bana sakate hai tathaa inkaa varnan or vyakhya kii ja sakati he
 Stratification relationships are relationships that are established between time-based archaeological sites, in a chronological sequence of their formation
 ek udhaaharan kisi khai tathaa us khai ko waapas bharne kaa ho saktaa he
 In terms of "filling" and "cutting" the trench will come later in the order "to be filled", for example it must be cut before the trench is filled
 ek sambandh yah he ki anukram main baad main aane vaale ko "ucch " sanderbhit kiya jaataa he tathaa anukram main pehle aane vaale ko "nimna " sanderbhit kiya jaataa he, haalanki shabd ucch athwa nimna kaa arth yah nahin he sandarbh bhautik rup se ooncha athwa nicha ho
 This higher and lower thinking may be more useful as a Harris matrix, which is a two-dimensional representation of the construction in the location and time of a site
 aadhunik puraatatv main kisi puratathvik sthal ko samajhane ke liye sandarbhon ko samoohon main baant kar unke sambandhon ke aadhaar par us samooh ko bada karte jane kii prakriya apanaai jaati he
 The terminology of the names of these large groups varies depending on different occupations, but some terms such as interface, sub-group, group and land use etc
 are commonly used
 up-samooh kaa ek udhaaharan dafan main prayukt teen sandarbhon se samajha ja saktaa he; kabr kaa aakaar, mrit sharir tathaa us sharir ke upar punah bhari gayi mitti
 is prakaar up-samooh anya up-samoohon ke saath stareekrut sambandhon ke aadhaar par ekatrit hokar samoohon kii rachana karte hai jo ki isi prakaar "charan" banaati he
 a sub-group burial-action may form a cemetery by forming a larger group with another sub-group burial-action, or may also form a burial-group that is later used as a building, such as a church " Phase "
 ek yaa adhik sandarbhon kaa ek kam sakhti se kiya gaya samooh kabhi-kabhi feechar bhi kehalaata he
 The phase is the most easily understood grouping of the common man, as it refers to the almost contemporary archaeological horizon, indicating "what you would have seen if you had gone back at a specific time"
 a phase is often, but not always, related to an occupational level identity, an "ancient plane", which existed some time ago
 charan kii vyakhya kaa nirmaan stareekrut vyakhya or utkhanan kaa pehla lakshya hota he
 Digging "in phase" is different from phasing
 puratathvik sthal kii charanbaddhata kaa arth sthal ko utkhanan athwa utkhanan-pashchaat samakaleen kshitijon main baantne se hota he jabaki "charan main khudaai" purartathvik avasheshon ko stareekrut rup se aise hataanaa hota he jisase ki ve sandarbh na hatane paayen jo ki samayik rup se iske purv ke hon athwa "anukram main neeche kii ore hon" isse pehle ki anya sandarbh jo ki starikaran sambandh main iske baad aate hai jaisaa ki superimpozishan ke niyam main kaha gaya he
 In practice the process of interpretation will continue with the excavation strategy at the archaeological site so that "phasing" can be carried out during excavation as far as possible, and is considered a good practice
 utkhanan ke prarambh main mashin dwaara upree mitti ke dher ko hataaya janaa sammilit hota he
 This material is tested through a metal detector so that any material left aside from the mistake can be discovered, but if it has not remained untouched since its abandonment, it will find a layer of modern materials in which archaeological interest Will be lacking gramin kshetron main sthit koi feechar sataha ke neeche dikhaai pad jaataa he parantu shahari kshetron main maanviya nikshep kii ek moti part ho sakati he, tathaa prarambh main sabase upree sandarbh hi pradarshit hoga tathaa ise anya sandarbhon se alag karke dekhnaa hoga
 a strategy for sampling references and features is created in which a decision is made about the complete excavation or partial excavation of each feature
 utkhanan kaa variyata praapt lakshya yah hota he ki sabhi puratathvik nikshepon tathaa feechar ko unke nirmaan ke ulate kram main hataaya jaye tathaa kalanukramik record athwa "anukram" ke rup main haris matrix banaayin jaae
 is haris matrix kaa prayog gyaan kii satat badhati hui ikaayiyon kii vyakhya tathaa inhen jodne main kiya jaataa he
 Stratified removal from the archaeological site is very important to understand the chronology of events here
 haalanki ise aisa sochaa janaa ki "puratathvik nikshep apane aane ke vipareet kram main sthal se jane chahie"
 aamtaur par ek grid banaayi jaati he jisamen sthal ko 5 meter ke virgon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he taaki feechar tathaa sandarbhon ko sampoorn sthal ke naqshe main sahi rup se sthanit kiya ja sake
 This grid is usually included in a national geometric database, such as the UK Ordnance Survey
 shahari kshetron ke puraatatv main yah grid ekal sandarbh recording ke karyanvan main amuly ho jaati he
 The single reference recording was developed by the London Museum in the 1970s and has since become the basic recording system in many parts of the world, particularly suited to the complexities and stratification of archeology in urban areas
 prayek utkhanit sandarbh ko ek "sandarbh sankhya" di jaati he tathaa isko prakaar ke aadhaar par sandarbh shit par likh liya jaataa he tathaa sambhawatah ise sampoorn yojana athwa khaanon par bana liya jaataa he
 References can be photographed on the basis of time constraints and importance, but in this case the purpose of photography is the classification of references and its relation to other references
 prayek sandarbh kii praptiyon ko unke sandarbh sankhya tathaa sthal kii code sankhya ke saath thilon main rakhaa jaataa he taaki baad main utkhanan pashchaat prati sandarbh main iskaa prayog kiya ja sake
 The height of the main parts of the reference from sea level, for example the difference between the upper and lower part of the wall, is removed and recorded in the plan sections and reference sheets
 oonchaaiyon kaa record gande sthal athwa sampoorn stesan ke saath darj kiya jaataa he tathaa isko sait asthaayee benchmark ke saapeksh dekha jaataa he
 Sometimes samples collected from references are also taken so that they can be subsequently analyzed for environmental analysis or scientific calculation
 apane mul arth main stareekrut utkhanan kii shreshth parampara main ek chakree prakriya sammilit he jisamen isamen sthal kii sataha par "punah khurpy chalaanaa" kiya jaataa he tathaa aise sandarbhon tathaa kagaaron ko pruthak kiya jaataa he jinhen apni purnataa athwa kisi anya sandarbh ke bhaag ke rup main hi samajha ja saktaa he After this initial process of defining the context, the context is evaluated in relation to the detailed information of the site in order to examine the need to divide the site in stages, after which it is removed and recorded in various ways
 is
 aksar, vyaavhaarik drushtikon yaa truti ke kaaran, sandarbh kii kagaaron ko paribhaashit karne kii prakriya kaa paalan nahin kiya ja paata he tathaa sandarbh ko anukram ke bina athwa gaiyr-stareekrut dhang se nikaal liya jaataa he
 This is called "stepless digging"
 yah acchhee pratha nahin he
 After removing the reference, and if feasible, removing the set of references for the feature, the process of "digging apart" is repeated until the man-made remains from that archaeological site are completely Do not be removed, and the site should not be completely naturalized
 utkhanan kii prakriya ko purnataya kai prakaar se praapt kiya ja saktaa he tathaa yah avasheshon ke prakaar tathaa samay seemaa par nirbhar karata he
 Mainly the remains are picked up with the help of trouvels and mattock and carried out in carts or buckets
 kai anya upkarnon kaa prayog, jinamein patali tauliya, jaise plaster lif tauliya tathaa kai shreniyon ke brush sammilit hai, najuk vastuon jaise ki maanav asthi tathaa sadi hui lakdi ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Some basic guidelines for removing material from the archaeological record are followed
 utkhanan kii aan trutiyaan do buniyadi shreniyon main rakhi ja sakati hai or inamen se kisi ek kaa hona lagbhag nishchit hi hota he kyonki utkhanan ek aisi dhwanskaari prakriya he jo soochna ko record karne ke saath hi use nasht bhi karti jaati he tathaa galatiyon kaa sudhaar aasaani se nahin ho paata he
 Over-harvesting indicates loss of information while under-cutting indicates false information
 kisi puratatvavid kii ek bhoomika mithyaa soochna se bachanaa tathaa soochna kii haani ko kam se kam karnaa bhi hoti he
 The objects and artefacts which are still remaining in the archaeological records have been extracted mainly by hand and through observation during the excavation of the relevant reference
 upyuktata or samay seemaa ke aadhaar par anya kai takneekein bhi uplabdh hai
 The method of filtering and flotation is used to maximize the excavation of small objects, such as small shards of clay vessels or flint pieces
 In research-based excavation, where there is a lot of time, the use of filtering method is quite popular
 cement mishrik tathaa vrahat str par chaanane kii prakriya main bhi kuch had tak safalataa mili he
 References from belche and mattock can be quickly removed by this method, yet it has a high rate of excavation
 spoil ko belche dwaara mishrik main daalaa jaataa he or ghol taiyaar karne ke liye isamen pani milaayaa jaataa he, jise phir ek jalidaar chaanane ke madhyam se udel diya jaataa he
 Flotation is a process of digging that is performed by putting the spoils on the surface of the water and separating the floating objects in the seated spoils, a particularly suitable method for retrieving environmental data, such as seeds and Small bones
 Not all items are extracted during excavation, and some are extracted, especially after excavation, on the basis of samples taken during excavation, especially after the flotation is performed
 utkhanan ke dauraan vastuon ko nikaalane main visheshgy kii bhoomika pramukh hoti he jo sandarbh ke vishay main puratetvik abhilekhon se sambandhit sthaan ke kalankan ke vishay main jaankaree detaa he
 By this, the re-deposition of the remains of the obtained objects with reference to the higher order, can give advance information about the possible discoveries that result from it
 sthaan kaa kalankan pushtikaran prakriya kaa or utkhanan ke dauraan puratetvik sthal kii charanbaddhata par kaaryaatmak avadharana kii vaidhata ke moolyankan kaa ek hissaa hota he
 For example, the discovery of an irregular medieval earthen pot in a supposedly ironic groove would naturally alter the ideas of the correct plan of excavation at that site and the misconception about the nature of the interpolation that could lead to losing Would secure a lot of information, which would have been destroyed by the excavation, and as a result, after the excavation, the expert had That the possibility of getting any other information from the site is also limited
 Or irregular information may show errors in excavation as "undercutting"
 kalankan paddati kuch had tak uchit utkhanan par nirbhar karti he or is prakaar yah donon prakriyaayein paraspar ek duusare par nirbhar karti hai
 There is a steady increase in the use of excavator, especially in excavation done by the developer, mainly due to time pressure
 yah vivaad kaa vishay he kyonki inke prayog ke falswaroop kisi puratetvik sthal par puratetvik kram kis prakaar darj kiye jate hai is sambandh main parinaamon main antar avashya hi kam ho jaataa he
 The machines are mainly used to remove modern load and control spoils
 british puraatatva main khudaai karanevaale yantron kii ore kabhi-kabhi "da big yelo trowell" ke upnaam se bhi sanket kiya jaataa he
 a group of archaeological excavators usually works for an inspector who is accountable to the site director or project manager
 puratetvik sthal kii vyakhya or antim report taiyaar karne ke liye ant main vah hi uttaradaayi hoga
 Most excavations are eventually published in commercial papers, although this process takes several years
 yah prakriya utkhanan ke baad hoti he or anginat anya visheshgyon ko viksit karti he
 There are many nebulae available when piercing the stars, from which we have come to know that many of them are clouds of gas or dust
 taron ke varnakram kii rakhaaon main bhi saamaanya varnakram se kuch bhinkataayen hoti hai, jiskaa kaaran taramdhyavarti gas yaa dhul samajha gaya he
 This starred gas or dust is going to give rise to our star systems
 jab tak vishwa main ye padaarth vidyaman rahenge, nae taron tathaa tarapranaliyon kaa janm hota rahegaa
 Their basic element is usually hydrogen
 in meghon kaa vyas 10 parsek yaa usase kam hota he
 The total mass of gas or dust in the world is estimated to be 20 billion times the mass of the Sun
 adhikansh taare mukhya kram ke hai, jinamein surya ek he
 Most stars are blurred in these stars as well
 in taron ke mul tatv praaia: ek se rahete hai
 Due to the decrease or decrease in the amount of material, their location is marked down or up in the main sequence curve

 Apart from this, there are classes of demons and super stars
 madhyavarti varg bhi shupalabdh hote hai
 Such as Upadanava and Upavaman etc
 in vargikarnon kaa taron ke vikaas se ghanishtha sambandh he
 Hydrogen occupies the first place among the basic elements of most stars and second in helium, but other basic elements are also present in the stars
 sabhi taron main in tatwon kaa vibhaajan ek sa nahin is
 isliye inke sanghatan main bhi antar dikhalaai detaa he
 The basic elements of main-order stars contain 70–90 percent and the helium content of 10–30 percent
 dhaatu tatv dwitiya population ke taron main naganya tathaa pratham population ke taron main teen pratishat tak rahete hai
 The stars derive molecular energy mainly from the carbon cycle or protein through the methods of proton reaction
 is prakriya main taron ke hydrogen ke kan helium main vikhandit hote rahete hai
 After this, the stars get heat from shrinkage
 sankochan se jab bhitari taap atyadhik bad jaataa he tab helium ke anuon main bhi anvik abhikriya prarambh ho jaati he
 Also, stars get energy for a long time
 is prakriya ke anusaar taron ke jivan kaa mukhya aadhaar unamem uplabdh hydrogen kaa bhandar hi he
 The energy transmission of stars is proportional to the cube of their mass, which results in the lifetime of stars with greater mass being shorter than the life of stars with less mass
 lagbhag 50-60 varsh pehle taron ke satat prakaash kaa kaaran keval sankochan vidhi hi samajha jaataa tha
 Sir Narman Lacair presented the theory of the development of stars on this basis
 is siddhant ke anusaar taare praarambhik avasthaa main vishaal tathaa thande kalpit kiye gaye, jo sankochan dwaara taap ke badhane se varnakram ke upar kii ore badhate gaye tathaa phir thande hote hue laal rangavaale vaaman banakar, bilkul thande hokar lupt ho gaye
 Till that time, astrologers did not study Danavakara and Vamnaraka stars
 iske pashrchatvikasavagad kaa prasiddh siddhant henry noris rasel ne 1913 i
 main prastut kiya
 It was envisaged that the stars evolved from red-colored red stars, which gradually become blue dark stars and fall down the main sequence and become lightless
 yah siddhant lagbhag 20 varsh tak prachlit rahaa
 Meanwhile, due to knowledge of atomic energy, the place of shrinkage got molecular reaction
 vartmaan kaal main taron ke vikaas ke sambandh main adhikansh jyotishiyon kii dharna he ki taron kaa praarambhik vikaas mukhya kram ke taare ke rup main hota he
 For some time, stars of low mass content move along the main sequence
 tatpashrchaat apni hydrogen dravya maatra kaa adhik upbhog karne lagate hai tathaa inkaa taap or aakaar badhane lagata he
 Then they leave the main sequence and move counterclockwise, from the right side of the curve, quickly upward
 adhik dravya maatra ke taare dakshinavart se neeche kii ore aane lagate hai
 Their hydrogen reserves are exhausted until they reach the peak
 phir ve thande hone lagate tathaa mukhya kram kii ore badhane lagate hai
 At this time due to the onset of inhibition, the molecular reaction in their helium stores also starts
 inke centre sthit helium main anvik abhikriya tibr hoti he tathaa inke bheetar dabaav main gadabadi aa jaati he
 Probably due to this, rotations cause shrinkage and transmission and thus take the form of movements
 jab ye sab prakaar ke anvik urja sroton kaa upbhog kar lete hai to ye sankochan se kuch der tak jivit rahete hai
 The stars of this stage are white Vamana
 inke sabhi dravyanu vikrut avasthaa main hote hai tathaa namikon se atyasanas hone se inkaa ghanatv Greatly increases
 taron ke jivan kii yah antimasana avasthaa hoti he
 The stars do not face death without opposition
 at:antim rup se bujhane se purv inamen bhayanak visphot hota he tathaa taare, navtaron ke rup main kshanik ujwal jivan dhaaran kar sadaa, ke liye jyotiheen ho jate hai
 The theory of distorted gases suggests that only those stars can become whitewashed, with a volume of about 1
4 times the mass of the Sun
 bahut se taron kii dravya maatra is seemaa se kam baithti he
 More stars of this quantity can become whitewashed only when they lose some of their liquid content
 aise taare atinav taare hi dekhe gaye hai, jo visphot se apni dravya maatra kho dete hai
 With this analysis, they should be very perfect, but they do not have the same velocity as the Population II and in some celestial stars dikhalaai pade hai, jo apekshaakrit naveen he
 In this way, the stage of development of whitewashed taro seems mysterious
 yadi ham taron ke vikaas ke liye unke vyaktigat swaroop ko na lekar, unke samuhik swaroop par vichaar karen, to hamen population pratham tathaa population dwitiya ke virgon kaa vishrleshan karnaa padegaa
 These are the two extreme stages of development
 population dwitiya main na to atidanavaakar taare hai, na gas, na dhul, na teevr ghurnan
 Population first has dust, gas, bright stars and rapid rotation
 ye taare sarpil bhujaaon main uplabdh hote hai
 This means that the power of the Navnirman of Population II is over and Population i is still in the initial stage of development
 akashgangeey punjon kaa vikaas gas meghon se hota he
 The inner molecules of the gas cloud are subjected to upheaval
 anuon ke is sangharsh ke kaaran isame kabhi-kabhi bhaag ghurnan ke kaaran atidaavnaakaar taare ban jaaenge, kintu kam dravya maatra ke tukade atyadhik honge, jo mukhya kram ke taare banenge
 The superstitious material parts will become sky-high
 purnat: vidyaman taare population dwitiya ke sadsy ban jaaenge
 We can also know the system of evolution of stars by the evolution of galaxies
 sarvapratham aniyamit akashgangaon kaa vikaas hota he
 When they start rotating around an axis, the gas dust that has not yet become a star begins to gather around the perpendicular plane on their axis
 jab tak gas kaa dhul uplabdh rahati he, nae taare janm lekar population pratham ke sadsy banate rahete hai tathaa puraane taare gunon main population dwitiya ke taron jaise hote jate hai
 These galaxies become elliptical when the gas or dust dissipates
 choti akashgangaayen kadachitkabhi bhi sarpil nahin hotin
 Large galaxies produce spiral arms by rotation
 ghurnan kii tivrata ke kaaran sarpil akashgangaayen bhi jo population dwitiya kii sadsy hai
 They gradually lose their spiral arms and their final form is elliptical
 mukhya kram ke taron main ghurnanaatmak gati rahati he
 At the time of shrinkage in its development stage it is rapid ghurnanaatmak gati praapt kar lete hai or inke kuch bhaag inase pruthakhokar nae taare ban jate hai
 Perhaps this is the reason why we get double stars in large amounts
 mukhya kram ke jin taron kii ghurnanaatmak gati kam hoti he, ve dhul yaa gas ke kanon se apane aakaar ko badhaakar daanavaakar taron kaa rup le lete hai
 Perhaps this is why their atmosphere is much wider
 taron ke vikaas ke sabhi siddhant abhi parokshnavastha main hai
 Further tests and research are being done about them

 Ajanta Caves There are about 29 rock-cut Buddhist caves located in Maharashtra, India, which belong to the 2nd century BCE
 yahan buddha dharm se sambandhit chithran evam shilpkaaree ke utkrisht namoonay milte hai
 Live illustrations are also available with them
 yah guphaayen ajanta naamak gaanv ke sannikat hi sthit he, jo ki maharashtra ke aurangabad jile main he
 Ajanta Caves have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983
 " According to "national Geographic": The flow of faith was such that almost all Buddhist temples, including Ajanta for centuries, seem to have been built under the rule and shelter of Hindu kings
 guphaayen ek ghaney jangal se ghiri, ashv naal aakaar ghati main ajanta gaanv se 31⁄2 kimi dur bani he
 The village is 106 km away from Aurangabad city of Maharashtra
 iskaa nikatatam kasbaa he jalgaam, jo 60 kimi dur he, bhusaval 70 kimi dur he
 In the foothills of this valley, the hill stream Vaghur flows
 yahan kul 29 guphaayen hai, jo ki nadi dwaara nirmit ek prapaat ke dakshin main sthit he
 Their elevation from the river ranges from 35 to 110 feet
 ajanta kaa math jaisaa samooh he, jisamen kai vihaar evam chaityas grih hai, jo ki do charnon main bane hai
 The first phase is mistakenly called the Hinayana phase, which is related to the Hinayana faith of Buddhism
 vastutah hinayan sthaviravaad ke liye ek shabd he, jisamen buddha kii moort rup se koi nishedh nahin he
 Ajanta's cave numbers 9, 10, 12, 13 15A were discovered at this stage
 in khudaayiyon main buddha ko stupa yaa math rup main darshit kiya gaya he
 Second phase excavations were discovered after nearly three centuries of stability
 is charan ko bhi galat rup main mahayan charan 9 buddha dharm kaa doosraa bada dhada, jo ki kamatar kattar he, evam buddha ko sidhe gaay aadi rup main chitron yaa shilpon main darshit karne kii anumati detaa he
 ) Many people call this phase Vakataka phase
 yah vatsagulm shakha ke shasit vansh vaakatak ke naam par he
 The construction date of this second phase is disputed among many academics
 haal ke varshon main kuch bahumat ke sanket ise paanchavin shatabdi main maanane lage hai
 According to Walter M
 Spink, an Ajanta expert, the Mahayan caves were built between 462–480 AD
 mahayan charan kii guphaayen sankhya hai 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, evam 29
 Cave number 8 was considered a cave of Hinayana phase for a long time, but at present it has been declared as Mahayan on the basis of facts
 mahayan, hinayan charan main do chaityagrih mili the, jo gupha sankhya 9 va 10 main the
 The cave numbers of this phase are 12, 13, 15 viharas
 mahayan charan main teen chaityas grih the jo sankhya 19, 26, 29 main the
 From the very beginning, the last cave was uninhabited
 anya sabhi mili guphaayen 1-3, 5-8, 11, 14-18, 20-25, va 27-28 vihaar hai
 The viharas found in the excavation are of several sizes, the largest being 52 feet, almost all square
 inke rup main bhi bhinnata he
 Many are simple, many are ornate, some are made of pavilions, and many are not
 sabhi viharon main ek aavashyak ghatak he— ek vrahat haul cameraa
 Among the Vakataka stages, many have not had holy places, because they were made only for religious gatherings and accommodation; Later holy places were added to them
 phir to yah ek maanak ban gaya
 The statue of Buddha in a central hall in this sacred place was often seated in the dharma-chakra-pramana posture
 jin gufaaon main naveenatam visheshtaayen hai, vahaan kinare kii deevaaron, dwaar mandapon par or praangan main gaun pavitra sthal bhi bane dikhte hai
 The walls of many viharas are decorated with carvings
 deevaaron or chhaton par bhitti chithran kiya hua he
 With the difference in Buddhist thought in the first century, Buddha was given the status of a deity and worshiped him
 parinamtah buddha ko puja-archana kaa kendra banaaya gaya; jisase mahayan kii utpatti hui
 In the past, academics divided the caves into three groups, but were rejected due to evidence and research
 us siddhanth ke anusaar 200 i purv se 200 i tak ek samooh, dwitiya samooh chhathi shatabdi kaa or tritiy samooh saatvin shatabdi kaa mana jaataa tha
 The expression cave temple used by the anglo-indians for the viharas was considered inappropriate
 ajanta ek prakaar kaa mahavidhyalay math tha
 Hiuen Tsang states that Dinnag, a famous Buddhist philosopher, philosopher who was the author of several texts on logic, lived here
 yah abhi anya saakshyon se pramanit hona shesh he
 At its peak, the Viharas had the ability to accommodate hundreds
 yahan shikshak or chaatr ek saath rahete the
 It is very sad that no cave of Vakataka stage is complete
 yah is kaaran hua ki shaasha vaakatak vansh ekaek shaktiviheen ho gaya, jisase uski praja bhi sankat main aa gayi
 Due to this, all activities were interrupted and stopped suddenly
 yah samay ajanta kaa antim kaal rahaa
 This is a first step and has no meaning in the sequence of other caves
 yah ashwanal aakaar kii dhaal par purvi ore se pratham gupha he
 According to Spink one of the last caves built at this site is towards the end of the Vakataka phase
 haalaanki koi shilalekhith sakshya upasthit nahin hai; phir bhi yah mana jaataa he ki vaakatak raja harisena is uttam sangrakshit gupha ke sangrakshak rahe hon
 The main reason for this is that Harisena was not initially involved in the protection of Ajanta, but could not stay away from them for a long time, because this site was full of activities during his reign and his Buddhist subjects were given this sacred work of that Hindu king
 Could be happy to shelter
 yahan darshit kai vishay rajsik hai
 This cave has very elaborate carving work, which also has many highly embossed crafts
 yahan buddha ke jivan se sambandhit kai ghatnaayen ankit hai, saath hi anek alankaran namoonay bhi hai
 Its two-storied gate-pavilion, which was visible until the nineteenth century, is now extinct
 is gupha ke aage ek khulaa sthaan tha, jiske donon ore khambhedaar galiyare the
 Its level was relatively high
 iske dwaar mandap ke donon ore kothiyaan hai
 The absence of the pillared cells at the end suggests that this pavilion was not built with the last phase of Ajanta, when the pillared cells had become a regular part
 porch kaa adhikansh kshetra kabhi muraal se bharaa rahaa hoga, jiske kai avshesh abhi bhi shesh hai
 There are three gateways here, one central and two sideways
 in dwarpathon ke bich do vargakar khidkiyaan taraashi hui he, jinase antas ujjwalit hota tha
 Each wall of the hall is about 40 feet long and 20 feet high
 baarah stambh andar ek vargakar coloned banaate hai jo chat ko sahaara dete hai, saath hi deevaaron ke saath-saath ek galiyara-sa banaate hai
 a gargantuan image is carved on the back wall, in which the Buddha is shown seated in his dharma-chakra-vimana posture
 peeche, baayin evam daayin diwaar main chaar-chaar kamare bane hai
 These walls are full of paintings, which are in a perfect state of preservation
 darshit drishy adhiktar upadeshon, dharmik evam alankaran ke hai
 Their subjects are related to Jataka tales, life of Gautama Buddha, etc
 gupha sankhya 1 se lagi gupha san 2, deevaaron, chhaton evam stambhon par sangrakshit apni chitrakaari ke liye prasiddh he
 It looks very beautiful and looks almost similar to the cave number, but is in a far better state of conservation
 is gupha main do dwaar-mandap hai, jo ki sankhya 1 se bahut alag he
 Rather, the carving of the panels also looks different from that
 is gupha ko sahaara diye do achche khaase mote stambh hai, jo ki baari nakkashi se alankrita hai
 Yes, it definitely resembles the first cave in size, shape and land plan
 saamne kaa porch donon ore stambhon se yukt prakoshthon se yukt he
 Formerly, rooms made up of vacant spaces were necessary when the latter required space, as the latter increased the need for more accommodation
 sabhi baad kii vaakatak nirmaanon main, porch ke ant main prakoshth aavashyak ang ban gayi
 Mural paintings on its roofs and walls have been published in sufficient quantity
 inamen buddha ke janm se purv bodhisattva rup ke anya janmon kii kathaayen hai
 There is a doorway between the back walls of the porch, which leads to the hall
 dwaar ke donon ore vargakar chaudee khidkiyaan hai jo prachur prakaash uplabdh karaati hai; jisase sundarata evam sammiti laati hai

 Kashyapa Rishi is the main sage among the ancient Vedic sages, once mentioned in the ेदgveda
 anya samhitaon main bhi yah naam bahuprayukt he
 He has always been described as very religious and mystical and has been said to be very ancient
 aitarey brahman ke anusaar unhone 'vishwakarmbhauvan' naamak raja kaa abhishek karaayaa tha
 Aitareya Brahmins have told about the relationship of Kashyapas to Janamejaya
 shatapath brahman main prajapati ko kashyap kaha gaya he: In the Mahabharata and Puranas, the description of the origin and lineage of the Asuras states that one of the six Manas sons of Brahma was 'marichi' who, by his will, gave birth to a Prajapati son named Kashyapa
 kashyap ne daksh prajapati kii 17 putriyon se vivaah kiya
 Following is the description of the child born to these daughters of Daksha: bhagwat puraana, markendeya puraana ke anusaar kashyap kii baarah bharyaayein thim
 Their names are: Aditi, Danu, Vinata, Aartha, Kadru, Sursha, Khasha, Surbhi, Tamra, Krodhavasha, Ira and Muni all created
 kashyap ek gotra kaa bhi naam he
 It is a very broad tribe
 jiskaa gotra nahin miltaa uske liye kashyap gotra kii kalpana kar lee jaati he, kyonki ek parampara ke anusaar sabhi jeevadhariyon kii utpatti kashyap se hui
 Once conquered the whole earth, Parashuram donated it to Kashyapa Muni
 kashyap muni ne kaha-'ab tum mere desh main mat raho
 Therefore, following the Guru's orders, Parashurama resolved not to stay on the earth at night
 ve prati raatri main man ke samaan teevr gamanshakti se mahendra parvat par jane lage
 Daksha Prajapati had two daughters in the Satyuga - Kadru and Vinata
 un donon kaa vivaah maharishi kashyap ke saath hua
 Once pleased, Kashyap asked both of them to ask for the desired groom
 kadru ne samaan parakramee ek sahastra naag-putr maange tathaa vinata ne uske putron se adhik tejasvi do putr maange
 Later, both received one thousand and two eggs respectively
 500 varsh baad kadru ke andon ke naag prakat hue
 Vinata jealously broke one of her eggs on her own
 usamen se ek aviksit balak niklaa jiskaa urdhvabhag ban chukaa tha, adhobhaag kaa vikaas nahin hua thaan usne cruddh hokar maa ko 500 varsh tak kadru kii daasi rahane kaa shaap diya tathaa kaha ki yadi doosraa anda samay se purv nahin phoda to vah purnaviksit balak maa ko daasitv se mukt karegaa
 The first child became Arun and became the charioteer of the sun in the sky and the second child became Garuda and flew into the sky
 vinata tathaa kadru ek baar kahin baahar ghoomane gayin
 Seeing a horse named Uchhashrava there, they both got the condition that anyone who misrepresented her color would become the maid of the other
 agle din ghode kaa rang dekhne kii baat rahi
 Vinata had described his color as white and Kadru had described his color as white, but the tail as black
 kadru ke man main kapat tha
 On his way home, he ordered his sons to wear black hair on his tail so that he would emerge victorious
 jin sarpon ne uskaa aadesh nahin mana, unhen usne shaap diya ki ve janamejay ke yajna main bhasma ho jaayen
 While approving this curse, Brahma called Kashyapa and said - 'the number of snakes you have produced has increased a lot
 tumhaari patni ne unhen shaap dekar acha hi kiya, at: tum usase rusht mat hona
 By saying this, Brahma gave Kashyapa the knowledge to remove the poison of snakes
 vinata tathaa kadru jab ucchashrava ko dekhne agle din gayin tab uski poonch kaale naagon se dhaki rahane ke kaaran kaali jaan pad rahi thi
 Vinata was very sad and took the place of Kadru's maid
 garud ne sarpon se poocha ki koun-sa aisa kaary he jisko karne se uski mata ko daasitv se chhutkaaraa mil jaayegaa? uske naag bhaaiyon ne amrit laakar dene ke liye kaha
 Garuda departs in search of nectar
 usko samast devataaon se yuddh karnaa padaa
 Being the most powerful, Garuda defeated everyone
 tadnantar ve amrit ke paas pahunchaa
 Taking a very subtle form, he crossed the cycle running continuously near Amritghat
 vahaan do sarp paharaa de rahe the
 After killing both of them, he picked up Amritghat and took it away
 usne swayan amrit kaa paan nahin kiya tha, yah dekhakar vishnu ne uske nirlypt bhav par prasann hokar use vardaan diya ki kah bina amrit piiye bhi ajar-amar hoga tathaa vishnu-dhwaja par uskaa sthaan rahegaa
 Garuda also accepted to be the vehicle of Vishnu
 maarg main indra mili
 Indra asked for the nectar and said that if the snakes drank it, they would be extremely hurt
 garud ne indra ko bataaya ki vah kisi uddeshy se amrit le ja rahaa he
 When he puts the elixir somewhere, Indra takes it
 indra ne prasann hokar garud ko vardaan diya ki sarp uski bhojan saamagree honge
 Later Garuda reached his mother
 usne sarpon ko soochna di ki vah amrit le aayaa he
 Release the snake plea from slavery and take a bath
 usne kushasan par amrit-kalash rakh diyaan jab tak sarp snaan karke laute, indra ne amrit chura liya tha
 The snakes licked Kusha itself, causing two parts of their tongue, so they started to be called Dwijivah
 indra ko blakhilya maharishiyon se bahut irshyaa thi
 Unhappy, Balkhilya gave part of his penance to Kashyapa Muni and asked him to destroy the item of Indra
 kashyap ne suparna tathaa kadru se vivaah kiya
 After both of them conceived, they went away by asking them to stay in the house with virtue
 unke jane ke baad donon patniyaan rishiyon ke yagyon main jane lageen
 They used to contaminate the future even when both the sages refused
