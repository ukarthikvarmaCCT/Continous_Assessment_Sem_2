 Physicists often use it to check the validity of an equation etc

 Initially dimensional analysis was used in the problems of mechanics, but nowadays it is being used in all kinds of physics and engineering problems

 The entire physical quantities are divided into two classes: yantric samasyaon main teen spasht praathmik raashiyon, lambaai, dravyaman, tathaa samay, ko manyata mili thi
 But if we also use them for magnetic, electrical and thermal quantities, then we have to forcefully include two other zodiac signs

 Later, the ultimate temperature and light intensity were also accepted as the basic unit
 udhaaharan ke liye, bal kii vimaa m l T-2, ooshmaa chaalakata kii vimaa l m T-3 q-1 or dharita kii vimaa Q2 T2 M-1 L-2 hai
 The unit method is used in actual use: kuch yantric raashiyon kii vimayein tathaa maatrak neeche kii sarini main die gayi hai
 The form of an equation does not depend on the fundamental units of measurement, then it is called dimensionally homogeneous

 The first step of dimensional analysis of a question decides the variables in the question

 We then compute the complete set of non-discrete products of the given variable-set and write a general relationship between them

 They are among the greatest rulers of Ranthambore

 Hammir Dev is considered to be the most powerful and talented ruler of the Ranthambore Empire of Rajasthan
 is shaasha ko chouhan vansh kaa udit nakshatra kahana atishyokti nahin hoga
 According to Dr
 Harvilas Sharda, Hammir Dev was the first son of Jaitrasinh and had two brothers, whose names were Suratana Dev and Birama Dev
 doctor dasharath sharma ke anusaar hammir dev jaitrasingh kaa teesraa putr tha vahiin gopinath sharma ke anusaar sabhi putron main yogyatam hone ke kaaran jaitrasingh ko hammir dev atyant priy tha
 Hammir Dev's father's name was Jaitrasinh Chauhan and mother's name was Hira Devi

 Rao Hammir Dev Chauhan Ranthambore was the ruler of Ranthabhwar
 ye prithviraj chouhaan ke vanshaj the
 His father's name was Jaitrasingh
 ye itihaas main ‘‘hathi hammir ke naam se prasiddh hue hai
 When Hammir became the ruler of Ranthambore in 1339, a new chapter in the history of Ranthambore begins
 hammir dev ranthambhore ke chouhaan vansh kaa sarvaadhik shaktishaalee evam mahatvapurn shaasha the
 He established a vast empire with his muscle power

 He was a descendant of Prithviraj Chauhan

 They have become famous in history as "hathi Hammir"
 jab hammir visan 1339 main ranthambhore ke shaasha bane tab ranthambhore ke itihaas kaa ek nayaa adhyay prarambh hota he
 Hammir Dev was the most powerful and important ruler of the Chauhan dynasty of Ranthambore
 inhone apane baahubal se vishaal samrajya sthapit kar liya tha
 Jalaluddin Khilji attacked Ranthambore in 1347 AD
 sabase pehle usne chhangarh par akraman kiya
 The Muslim army took control of this fort after strong resistance
 tatpashchaat muslim sena ranthambhore par akraman karne ke liye aage badi
 He attacked to take over the fort, but the Chauhan heroes, led by Hammir Dev, did so much harm to the Sultan, that he was forced to return to Delhi
 chhangarh par bhi chouhanon ne dubaara adhikaar kar liya
 Two years after this attack, the Muslim army invaded Ranthambore again, but they were defeated this time and returned to Delhi
 visan 1353 main sultan jilaluddin khilji kii hatya karke allaudin khilji dilli kaa sultan bana
 He aspired to bring the whole of India under his rule
 hammir ke netritv main ranthambhore ke chouhanon ne apni shakti ko kaaphi sudrudh bana liya or rajasthan ke vistrut bhubhag par apana shashan sthapit kar liya tha
 Alauddin Khilji did not want to see the increasing power of the Chauhans near Delhi, so a struggle was inevitable
 i

 1299 main allaudin kii sena ne gujarat par akraman kiya tha
 They were bringing a lot of loot money from there to Delhi
 maarg main lut ke dhan ke bantwaare ko lekar kuch senanayakon ne vidroh kar diya tathaa ve vidrohi senanayake raav hammirdev kii sharan main ranthambhore chale gaye
 These commanders were Mir Muhammad Shah and Kamru
 sultan allaudin ne in vidrohiyon ko saunp dene kii maang raav hammir se kii, hammir ne uski yah maang thukraa di
 Rao Hammir, following the principles of Kshatriya religion, did not return the soldiers who came to the asylum
 sharan main aae hue kii raksha karnaa apana karttavya samajha
 Alauddin got angry on this and prepared for war on Ranthambore
 allaudin kii sena ne sarvapratham chhangarh par akraman kiya
 He easily got here
 chhangarh par musalamaanon ne adhikaar kar liya he, yah samachar sunakar hammir ne ranthambhore se sena bheji
 The Chauhan army defeated the Muslim soldiers
 muslim sena parajeet hokar bhaag gai, chouhanon ne unka lutaa hua dhan va astr-shastr lut liye
 In 1358 AD, Alauddin Khilji again attacked the Chauhans
 chhangarh main donon senaaon main bhayankar yuddh hua
 In this war, Hammir himself did not go to war
 vir chouhanon ne veertapurvak yuddh kiya lekin vishaal muslim sena ke saamne kab tak tikte
 In the end, the Sultan took control of Chhangarh
 tatpashchaat muslim sena ranthambhore kii taraf badhane lagi
 The Turkish generals sent information to Hamir Dev, to hand us over to our rebels, whom you have given shelter to
 hamaari sena vaapis dilli laut jaaegi
 But Hammir was firm on his word
 usne sharnaagaton ko saunpane athwa apane rajya se nirvasit karne se spasht manaa kar diya
 The Turkish army laid siege to Ranthambore
 turki sena ne nusrat khan or ulug khan ke netritv main ranthambhore par akraman kiya
 Due to the fort being on a very high mountain, it was very difficult for the enemy to reach it
 muslim sena ne gheraa kada karte hue akraman kiya lekin durg rakshak un par pattharon, baanon kii bauchhaar karte, jisase unki sena kaa kaaphi nuksaan hota tha
 This kind of encirclement of the Muslim army continued for many days
 lekin unka ranthambhore par adhikaar nahin ho sakaa
 Alauddin again sent messengers to Rao Hammir to hand over the rebel soldiers, our army would return to Delhi
 hammir hath purvak apane vachan par drudh tha
 For a long time the circle of the Muslim army continued and the Chauhan army kept on fighting
 allaudin ko ranthambheer par adhikaar karnaa mushkil lag rahaa tha
 He resorted to deceit
 hammir ke paas sandhi kaa prastaav bheja jisko paakar hammir ne apane aadmi sultan ke paas bheje
 Among those men, there was a Surjan Kothari and some crying heroes
 allaudin ne unako lobh laalach dekar apni taraf milaane kaa prayaas kiya
 Some of these secretly turned to the Sultan
 durg kaa dheraa bahut dinon se chal rahaa tha, jisase durg main rasad aadi kii kami ho gai
 The fortress now considered the final decisive war
 rajputon ne kesharia vastra dhaaran karke shaakaa kiya
 The Rajput army opened the fort's doors
 bheeshan yuddh karnaa prarambh kiya
 There was a face-to-face battle on both sides
 ek ore sankhya bal main bahut kam rajput the to duusari ore sultan kii kai guna bady sena, jinke paas paryeti yuddhadi saamagree evam rasad thi
 In front of the might of the Rajputs, the Muslim soldiers could not stand, they ran away leaving the flags of the Muslim soldiers, the Rajputs snatched and the Rajput army returned to the fort
 durg par se raniyon ne musalamaanon ke jhando ko durge kii ore aate dekhakar samajha kii rajput haar gaye atah unhone johar kar apane aapako agni ko samarpit kar diya
 On entering the fort, seeing the flames of Jauhar, Hamir realized his mistake
 usne praayshchit karne hetu kile main sthit shiv mandir par apana mastak kaat kar shankar bhagwaan ke shivlinga par chadhaa diya
 When Alauddin came to know about this incident, he returned and captured the fort
 yah pankti hammir mahakavy main hammir dev chouhan ke bare main likhi gai he is pankti kaa taatpary he ki rajasthan ke ranthambhore samrajya kaa maharaja hammir dev chouhan singh ke samaan gujarata tha arthath usne kabhi chhupakar muqabla nahin kiya wo sher kii bhanti raaj karata tha
 The promise of the word means that King Hammir considered it his first duty to fulfill the promise given to him, and in the same way that the fruit of the Kadali grows once in the same way, in the same way, King Hammir was also angry when he got victory over anger
 
 triya arthath aurat ko shaadi ke vakt ek baar hi tel chadhaane kii rasm hoti he usee prakaar hammir bhi kisi kaary ko baar baar dohraane kii bajaae ek hi baar main puraa karnaa mahatv purna samajhataa tha arthath raja hammir dev chouhan kaa hath uski nidarta kaa pratik rahaa he
 He was the only Chauhan ruler who considered independent rule to be his pride and this self-respect of Hammir Dev Chauhan was heartening to Maharana Pratap and Pratap did not accept the Mughal ruler Akbar's lifetime suzerainty
 doctor dasharath ne mana he ki hammir dev chouhan ke pita maharaja jaitrasingh ne hammir kaa rajarohan san 1282 main apane hi jeevankaal main kar diya tha
 According to the Hammir epic, Hammir was not the eldest son, however he sat on the throne on the Vikram Samvat 1339 in Magh month on Sunday
 vahiin prabandhkosh ke anusaar hammir dev chouhan kaa rajarohan vikram sanwat 1343 ke kareeb bataaya gaya he
 The creation of both the Hammir epic and Prabandhak epics were contemporaries of Hammir Dev, Dasharatha Sharma accepted the coronation of Hammir Dev between 1339 and 1343 and his father Jaitrasinh handled Hammir Dev as a vast empire of the Ranthambore empire
 But Hammir Dev Chauhan's ambitious ruler was not satisfied with this empire
 bharatvarsh ke aitihaasik shaskaon main hammir dev chouhan ko hathiraja hathpati ranpati evam ranpradesh kaa chouhan naam se pahchaan banaai
 The name of the beloved horse of Maharaja Hammir Dev Chauhan was Badal, the name of the queen of Hammir Dev Chauhan was Rangadevi and the name of her daughter was Padmala, which was very dear to Hammir Dev

 The creator of the Hammir epic was Nayanchandra Suri, this epic describes in detail the empire of Hammir Dev Chauhan, the great ruler of Ranthambore

 Nayanchandra Suri has also briefly described Jaitrasinh and the earlier Ranthambore rulers in this epic

 In this Prabandhakavya, the character of Hammir Dev, the famous ruler of Ranthambore, is described on the Chappay system of the Veeragatha period
 is main bataaya gaya he ki hammir dev chouhan ne sharnaagat kii raksha ke liye apana sabakuch nyochhavar kar diya
 King Hammir defeated the Delhi ruler Jalaluddin Khilji several times and shattered the teeth of a ruler like Alauddin Khilji
 hammir rasau hammir kii virgthaon ke saath ojasvi bhashaa main bahut acha mahakavy he
 This epic tells that Muhammad Shah was very much in love with the Begum of Alauddin Khilji, the ruler of Mongol Delhi and robbed him of his wealth and fled from there, which Alauddin Khilji wanted to capture

 In Samvat 1902, Chandrashekhar Vajpayee wrote Hammir Hatha Granth

 According to Hammir Rasou, the Ranthambore Empire extended Hammir Dev from Ujjain to Mathura and from Malwa to Arbudachal
 hammir rasau se gyaat hota he ki hammir dev ujjain ko jitkar mahakaleshwar jyotirling main shiv kii puja kii thi evam ajmer ko jitkar pushkar main shahi snaan kiya tha
 Some verses of Hammir Rasou are intended: - kab hath kare alaudi, rantabhanvar garh aahi
 Kabhai Sekh Sarnai is staying, Bahimah Mahim Sahi
 
 Let me think in your mind, the title is not fermented

 According to Dashrath Sharma, Hammir Chauhan defeated King Jayasimha of Mandalgarh Udaipur and kept him captive in Ranthambore, after that Hammir Dev left him on the point that he would continue to give the Ranthambore empire forever and in the interest of every possible Ranthambore empire
 Will work hammir dev ne vartmaan mount abu ke raja pratapsingh ko parrast karne ke baad maar diya tha
 Prominent victories of Hammir Dev include: - is prakaar doctor gopinath sharma ne hammir dev chouhan ko saulah nrip mardaani evam dow dasharath sharma ne saulah vijay kaa karn kahkar pukaara he
 The kingdom where Hammir Dev invaded became part of the Ranthambore empire and perhaps this is the reason why Hammir Dev Chauhan started going to the stubborn emperor of India

 Sometimes it is also called 'astrophysics' although it is a major branch of astrophysics in which stars are studied
 prakruti ke rahasyon ko samajhane k utkar ichha se perit hokar manushya ne akashiya pandon kaa adhyayan prarambh kiya
 He obtained as much information about them as could be obtained with the help of eyes only; For example, he began to understand the daily and annual movements of the earth and the physical events associated with it, the arts of the moon and the lunar month, the movements of the planets, etc
 parantu jab tak surya, chandramaa tathaa grahon ko bimb or taron ko prakashabindu samajha jaataa rahaa, inke vishay main adhik na janaa ja sakaa
 The Italian astrologer Galileo Galilei used the telescope for the first time in 1612 in the study of the sky; But until the advancement of the telescope was made, there was no use of any more important information other than the study of the planets
 jyon jyon doordarshee kii rachana main sudhaar hota gaya, jyotish sambandhi anusandhan main uski upyogita badhati gai, parantu khagolbhautikee kaa prarambh to 19veen shatabdi ke dwitiya chaturthaansh main hua, jab surya tathaa anya taron ke prakaash ke adhyayan main germany ke bhautikavid, gustaf robert kirkhhof, dwaara pratipaadit varnakramiki ke siddhanton kaa upyog prarambh hua
 Photography helped immensely in the development of this instrument, because with its help, the spectrographs became available for comparative study permanently
 isi prakashmiti or varnakram kii rekhaon kii tivrata naapane ke sadhano ne varnakramiki dwaara kiye gaye adhyayan main sahyogi banakar, khagoleey pindon kii bhautik avasthaa ke vishay main amuly soochna pradaan kii
 When a gas is lit, according to Kirkhhoff's theory, it radiates only the light of particular characters, not radiating white light
 in varnon ko gas ke lakshanik varna kehete hai
 Which characters will appear in these colors, if they emit white light from the radiant gas in that physical state, then the spectrum of white light does not become black, but the characteristic characters of the gas are absent in it
 iske atirikt yadi shwet prakaash ke udgam kaa taap gas ke taap se unchaa ho, to varncrampatt main gas ke lakshanik varno ke sthaan main kaali rekhaayen, jinhen fronhophar rekhaayen kehete hai, prakat hoti hai
 Based on the study of these black lines, it can be said that in which gas the white light has reached the spectroscope and its gas atoms are in what physical state
 kirkhhof ne is siddhant kaa pratipaadan prayogon ke aadhaar par kiya tha
 But later, with the help of knowledge of atomic structure and quantum theory, the laws of spectroscopy could be theoretically presented
 uparyukt kathan se yah spasht he ki khagolbhautikee ke adhyayan main varnakramiki ke saadhan kii upyogita kii ek swaabhaavik seemaa he
 This is because the spectrograph can give information about the physical state of matter only when the substance is in the form of radiant gas
 at: is saadhan se yah nahin janaa ja sakegaa ki prakaash ke path main sthit pindkhand kin padaarthon ke bane hue hai tathaa unki bhautik avasthaa kya he
 The light that comes from celestial bodies is produced in its internal parts, yet nothing can be said about the composition of those parts with the help of spectroscopy
 vah to keval in pindon ko ghere hue gasmandal ke vishay main hi soochna dene main samarth he
 As a result, to know about the composition and physical state of the internal parts of these bodies, different means are needed from spectral spectra
 in sadhano kaa varnan aage kiya jayega
 In consideration of the means of study, the Tarapind can be divided into two main parts: the inner part and the gasosphere
 varnakram ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par taron ke vishay main anek tathy gyaat kiye ja chuke hai jinamein se pramukh nimnlikhit he: The Sun and other stars are huge spherical bodies of radiant gas, whose surface parts, called dorsal, have thousands of degrees
 prishth se jyon jyon taare ke centre kii ore badhen, taap me main vruddhi hoti jaati he; yahan tak ki kendriya taap kai lakh paaya jaataa he
 The prayek taare kaa aantarik bhaag gasmandal se ghira hua he
 The elements that have been identified in these gasmands are also found on earth
 iskaa arth yah kadaapi nahin ki yahan par prithvi par paae janevaale tatwon se bhinn anya tatv nahin honge
 In fact there are such Fraunhofer lines in the spectrum of stars which are different from the lines of any element found on earth
 taron ke gas mandal main mukhya rup se hydrogen, helium, carbon, loha aadi upasthit hote hai
 The Indian astrologer, Meghnad Saha, gave his famous thermodynamic formula in 1922, with the help of which the fact of the spectrum strip can be understood
 england ke prasiddh jyotishi adington ke shabdon main saaha sutara, doordarshee ke pashchaat, jyotish main sabase adhik mahatvapurn avishkaar he
 Effective temperature is determined by studying the continuous spectrum of stars
 anveshan main yah kalpana kii jaati he ki tara ek adarsh krishna pind he, jiskaa taatpary yah he ki uskaa prishth is prakaar sangathit he ki vah un sab vikiranon kaa, jo usapar nipaat karte hai, purna rup seavasoshana kar letaa he
 Kirkhhoff and Belfur and Stuart have proved that if the energy of a body does not change, each character has its radiation and absorption volumes in a particular ratio
 krishna shabd kaa pind ke drishy rang se koi sambandh nahin he
 Theoretical, or experimental, studies of such bodies have proved that the intensity of each color is fixed at a particular temperature
 plank ne ooshmaagatiki ke aadhaar par ek sutara kaa pratipaadan kiya he, jo yah bataata he ki ooshmaa gatikeey samya kii avasthaa main adarsh krishna pind ke amuk varna ke vikiran kii amuk tivrata hoti he
 The diagram above shows the relationship between wavelength and radiation intensity
 pind ke die hue taap ke liye vakr or tarangadaidhray ke aksh ke madhya main simit kshetrafal us sampurna urja ko nishchit karata he jiskaa vikiran tara akaash main prati kshan kar rahaa he
 It is also clear from these curves that along with the change in temperature of the body there is also a change in the wavelength of maximum intensity
 vastut: jyon jyon pind ke taap main vruddhi hoti jaati he, mahattam tivrata kaa tarangadaidhray ghatata jaataa he, arthath vah varnakram main drishy bhaag kii ore hatataa jaataa he
 According to Planck's rule for the ideal Krishna body, the formula for revealing the relation of heat and maximum intensity of wavelength is easily determined
 at: taare ke prabhavi taap ko nishchit karne ke liye pehle uske varnakram ke adhyayan se mahattam tivrata ke vikiran kaa tarangadaidhray gyaat kiya jaataa he
 The effective temperature of the star is actually the temperature of that ideal Krishna body whose maximum intensity of radiation is in the same wavelength as that of the star
 taron ke varnakram lekhon main badi bhinnata pai jaati he, parantu phir bhi yadi mukhya mukhya fronhophar rekhaon par hi dhyaan den to in varncrampatton ko kuch virgon ko kuch virgon main baanta ja saktaa he
 In the last century, many astrologers tried to classify stars with the idea of alphabetical order, but the prevailing classification was done in the first years of the current century by Professor Mickering, Mrs
 Fleming and Kumari Kennan at the Harvard Wageshala
 is vargeekaran main kuch aksharon kaa prayog kiya gaya he, jinke varan kaa suvidha ke atirikt or koi vishesh vaigyanik aadhaar nahin he
 The main classes of this classification are marked with O, B, A, F, C, a and M
 For convenience, each of these classes is divided into ten subclasses
 vyavhaar main taare ke varg kaa nishchay uske varncrampatt kii pramukh avasorana rekhaon kii tivrata ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he, jo taap evam daab donon par nirbhar karti hai
 Therefore, the effect of temperature and pressure is considered in the classification in such a way that most of the stars can be divided into two main categories: massive stars and vamana stars and then the intensity of absorption lines in each range varies so regularly that the given intensities For the class of stars, consequently its effective temperature, can be decided exclusively
 diye hue varg ke vishaal taare kaa taap usee varg ke vaaman taare ke taap kii apeksha kam hota he
 Surya is a member of Vamana category
 nimnaankit sarini main in virgon se sangat vaaman shrenee ke taron ke liye prabhavi taap evam varncrampatt kii vishetaayen di gai he: Later on, in order to include the nonspecific observed strings in the classification, at the beginning of this classification, the sum of squares and at the end, n and r were used, and the resulting classification is as follows: varnakramiki ke saadhan ne yah bhi prakat kiya ki bahut se taare, jo bade se bade doordarshee dwaara liye gaye photographon main akele dikhaai dete hai, vastav main do taare hai, jo apane gurutvakentre kii parikrama karte rahete hai
 These stars are called spectral coupler stars
 chumbakeey kshetra main sthit deeptiman gas kii varnakram rekhaayen saadhaaran dasha main vikirit rekhaon kii apeksha adhik vistrut hoti hai tathaa prayek do main or kabhi kabhi adhik uparekhaon main khandit ho jaati he
 This is called the Geman effect
 babakaak ne kuch taron ke varncrampatton main is prabhaav ko vidyaman paaya, jiske aadhaar par usne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki in taron main surya kii bhanti chumbakeey kshetra vidyaman he
 The space between the stars is not completely lacking in substance
 vahaan atyant visarit dhuli tathaa pindkhand vidyaman hai
 For example, in the galaxy, about 25 nodules of radius 10–5 cm per cubic cm are found, one hydrogen atom per cubic cm, and 10–5 cm per cubic km
 is prakaar is sthaan main sthit padaarth kaa ghanatv lagbhag 3n10-24 gram prati ghan senmi0 he
 The density of matter in the star gases is almost the same
 yah kathan akashganga ke anya bhaagon ke vishay main satya nahin he
 It is now known with certainty that the density is different in different parts of each nebula
 taare ke bheetar ke padaarth kii pravriti gas ke ghaney meghon ke rup main vidyaman hone kii pai jaati he
 The mass of these clouds is similar to the beam of stars and sometimes the mass of massive constellations
 yah megh apane peeche sthit taron ke prakaash kaa avasorana hi nahin, varan uskaa prakirnan bhi karte hai, jisase taare kaa prakaash rakt varna kaa abhasith hone lagata he; udaahranarth, prithvi ke vayumandal ke anu sandhya samay surya ke prakaash kaa prakirnan kar surya ko rakt varna pradaan karte hai
 It is only by studying the quantity of this scattering that the determination of the mass of the bodies present in matter within the star is determined
 jaisaa pehle likhaa ja chukaa he, taron ke aantarik sanghatan ko jaanane kaa koi bhautik saadhan uplabdh nahin he
 Hence mathematical means have to be used to study this composition
 awalokit saamagree tathaa bhautik siddhanton ke anukool taron ke aantarik bhaag ke saral praturup kii kalpana kii jaati he or phir is praturup ke bhautik lakshna ganit kii reeti se nishchit kiye hote hai
 If these signs are similar to the star-illuminated signs, then it is concluded that there are similar physical states in the interior of the star as in the model
 aise kitne hi pratirupon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he
 As a result, proper knowledge of the composition of the interior of the stars has been obtained
 kuch prakaar ke taron kaa punj or unke ardhavyas gyaat hai
 Apart from this, each star has an essential characteristic that it continuously radiates energy everywhere in the sky
 urja ke vikiran kii dar, jise taare kii jyoti kehete hai, taare kaa utana hi mahatvapurn lakshan he jitne uske punj or ardhavyas
 If an outline of the stars and their radii is drawn, it becomes clear that the stars can be divided into approximately three parts
 taron ke punj or jyotishyon kaa rekhachitr bhi is kathan kaa samarthan karata he
 For most stars, their light rotates according to the power of about 3
5 degrees of the beam
 in taron ke samooh ko mukhya shrenee kehete hai
 The stars which are different from this category are of two types: White Vamana and Trumpler Stars
 trumpler taron kii jyoti unke punj ke anupaat main vicharan karti he
 If one compares the stars and radii of the white and vamana of the main class of the same beam, it is found that the white aeration is much less vibrant than the main star and the radius is also much less
 at: shwet vaaman kaa padaarth atyant ghan hona chahie
 The second-lure is considered representative of the white-vamana category
 iskaa madhya ghanatv lagbhag 6
8 jr104 gram prati ghan senmi0 he
 Here, if you compare the stars of the main range of the same effective heat and the lights of white Vamana, then the white Vamana is much less vibrant than the stars of the main range
 ye bhinnataayen taron ke aantarik sanghatan kii bhinnata kii dyotak hai
 St James's House is a Grade II listed building in Monmouth, Monmouthshire, Wales
 yah aitihaasik saint james squaire main madhyakaalin nagar deevaaron ke bheetar maujuud he
 While the house has an attractive 18th-century abduction at the present time, this house was originally born as a burgess house

 Archaeological excavations at St James's Square in the year 2010 show the evidence of the settlement of the medieval period in the city of Monmouth for the first time
 saint james house ke haal hi ke nivaasiyon main monmouth skool ke boarding chaatr shaamil hai
 St
 James House is located at the eastern end of Whitecross Street, where the road ends at the roundabout that surrounds the triangular St
 James Square
 imaarat chauraahey kii uttari disha main sthit he, jahaan 2009 main puratathvik khudaai kii gai thi
 In some modern-day maps, the eastern side of Whitecross Street, which ends at an intersection with Monk Street at the roundabout that surrounds St
 James's Square, is also referred to as part of St
 James' Square, Thus some buildings on Whitecross Street have two addresses
 isi prakaar saint james house ke bhi do pate hai: 10 saint james squaire or 10 whitecross street
 St
 James House was granted the status of Grade II Class building on 27 June 1952
 teen manjila is imaarat pe atharahavin sadi kaa agavada he
 Its outer part is made of red bricks
 neeche kii manjilon kii be khidkiyaan ytaakar he jabaki sabase upar kii manzil kii vargakar
 The one exception is on the first floor where one of the middle windows is longer and rounded than the rest of the windows
 daravaaje ke upar phanlit he
 a little seventeenth century plaster work is done inside the house
 vidyut motor ek vidyutyantric mashin he jo vidyut urja ko yantric urja main badalati he; arthath ise upyukt vidyut strot se jodne par yah ghoomane lagati he jisase isse judi mashin yaa yantra bhi ghoomane lagati he
 That is, it works the opposite of an electric generator which produces electrical energy by taking mechanical energy
 kuch motaren alag-alag paristhitiyon main motor yaa janarator dono kii tarah bhi kaam karti hai
 Electric motors are means of converting electrical energy into mechanical energy
 vidyut motor audyogic pragati kaa mahatvapurn suchak he
 It is a very simple and very useful machine
 udyogon main shaayad hi koi aisa prayojan ho jiske liye upyukt vidyut motor kaa chayan na kiya ja sake
 The basic purpose of electric motors is to generate relative speed between the stator and the rotor by generating electromagnetic force / force
 is prakaar vidyut motor, vidyut urja lekar yantric kaary karti he
 The Lorenz force exerted on the current drivers of the winding of the motor is expressed by the following equation: motor dwaara utpann yantric shakti Pem nimnlikhit sameekaran se di jaati he- Where the angular speed of the shaft should be in radians per second and t newton-meter
 raikhik motaron ke liye, Where f is in newtons and velocity v is in meters per second
 vidyut motor udyogon main ek adarsh pradhan chaalak he
 Most machines are powered by electric motors
 iskaa mukhya kaaran yah he ki vidyut motaron kii dakshata duusare chaalkon kii tulana main unchi hoti he
 Also, his performance is often better than them
 vidyut motor pravartan tathaa niyantran ke drushtikon se bhi adarsh he
 Driving, or stopping the motor, and changing the speed can be done more easily than other drivers
 iskaa duurastha niyantran bhi ho saktaa he
 Electric motors have become so popular due to the ease of control
 vidyut motor anek kaaryon main prayukt ho sakate hai
 They can run large machines of several hundred horsepower and machines ranging from the smallest to horsepower
 udyogon ke atirikt ye krishi main bhi, kheton ke jotane, bone tathaa kaatane kii mashiinon ko or sinchai ke pampon ko chalaane ke liye, prayukt hote hai
 Machines of refrigeration, washing and other works are also run in these houses
 vidyut motor bhinn-bhinn prayojanon ke liye bhinn bhinn prayojanon ke liye bhinn bhinn prarupon ke bane hai
 They have simple controllers, from which many types of work can be taken
 sambharan ke anusaar paramparaagat rup se motor do prakaar ke ginaye jate rahe hai ham ynha sansofhan dekhnege- dishtdhaara motor evam prayavarti dhara motor 
 There are many types of both, according to their specific characteristics
 kintu samay ke saath yah vargeekaran kamjor pad gaya he kyonki universal motor e
si
 se bhi chal sakati he
 The development of power electronics has now turned the commutator out of the motors
 motaron kaa doosraa vargeekaran sincronas or acincronas ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 This is to some extent a more rational classification
 sincronas mashiinon kaa roter usee koniya chaal se chakkar katata he jis gati se us motor kii prayavarti dhara ke kaaran utpann chumbakeey kshetra gati karata he
 But in contrast the rotor of asynchronous motors rotates at a lower speed
 preran motor iskaa pramukh udhaaharan he
 Some of the major motors are as follows: disi motaren vahaan adhik upyogi hoti hai jahaan chaal-niyantran bahut mahatv rakhata he
 This is because their speed control can be done very easily
 yah vastav main cerise disi motor he jo asi evam disi dono se chalaayi ja sakati he
 The motor of the mixer used in homes is a universal motor
 iske atirikt railgadee kaa ingine khinchne ke liye univershal motor kaa hi upyog kiya jaataa he kyonki inaki chaal ke saath balaghurna ke badalane kaa sambandh is kaam ke liye bahut upyukt he
 This motor produces a lot of acceleration at low speeds, while the speed generated by it increases with increasing speed
 sabase-saamaanya prayavarti dhara motor preran motor he, jo preran ke siddhant par kaary karata he
 This motor is most commonly used due to which it is called the workhorse of industries
 isamen ghisne vaala koi avyav nahin he jisase yah bina marammat ke bahut dino tak chal saktaa he
 Most motors used in homes for general tasks and low power are single-phase induction motors, also known as fractional horsepower motors
 udhaaharan ke liye pankhons, dhulaai kii mashiinon ke motor aadi
 Reverse current motors also have field coils and armatures similar to direct current motors, but in some different form
 inamen do mukhya bhaag hote hai : ek to stater, jo sthir rahata he or doosraa roter ko ghumta he
 Reverse current motors are also of different types
 teen feji sincronas motor bahut kam upyog main aati he
 One of its main uses is to improve the power coefficient
 yah apane-aap start nahin hoti evam chalaanaa armbh karne ke liye kuch atirikt vyavastha kerani padati he
 But synchronous generators or alternators are used a lot and most of the world's electrical power is being generated by alternators
 yah motor kii laagat jyada nahin hoti he
 These days are being used in high speed trains
 aajkal inkaa upyog sthiti niyantran evam chaal-niyantran ke liye bahut hota he
 It is very easy to control them with the help of numerical bodies; Such as with the help of a microcontroller
 yadi chaal vyavasthaapan kaaphi vistrut paraas main karnaa ho, to shraag motor bahut upyukt hote hai
 In many places, operating characteristics of direct current, range motor is desirable
 isaki vyavastha karne ke liye prayavarti dhara motaron main bhi praytn kiya gaya he
 The alternating current range motor and the interchangeable motor provide similar characteristic features
 tulykaalik motor keval tulykaalik chaal par hi prachaalan kar sakate hai
 Therefore, where uniformity is required, these are ideal
 jis prakaar disht dhara janitr evam motor, vastut: ek hi mashin hai or donon ko kisi bhi rup main prayog karnaa sambhav he
 Similarly, synchronous motor is also, in fact, the form of alternating current generator, commonly called alternator, and it is possible to use both in any form
 iske prachaalan ke liye iske stater main prayavarti dhara sancharan tathaa roter main disht dhara uttejk donon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Use of these motors is somewhat limited
 disht dhara uttejan ke liye prayavartit kii bhanti hi inamen bhi ek uttejan ke liye prayavartit kii bhanti hi inamen bhi ek uttejk kii vyavastha hoti he
 The main advantage of these motors is that the power factor can also be increased by increasing the excitation
 at: visheshtya un udyogon main jahaan bahut se preran motor hone ke kaaran, athwa kisi or kaaran, se shaktigunank bahut kam ho jaataa he, vahaan tulykaalik motaron kii vyavastha kar shaktigunank ko sudhara ja saktaa he
 In many places these motors are used only for power factor correction
 aisi dasha main inhen tulykaalik sandharitra kaha jaataa he
 In many places only one-way feeding is available
 vahaan ekakaleey motor prayog kiye jate hai
 Single-phase induction motors are very popular for small machines and household works
 bijli ke pankhons main bhi ekakaleey motor prayukt hote hai
 Similarly, single-motor motors are predominant in the washing machines, refrigerators and sewing machines etc
 ekakaleey motaron kii mukhya kathinaayee inke aarambh karne main hoti hai
 Some kind of art diversion is necessary to get started
 kala vipatan saadharantaya ek sahaayak kundali dwaara kiya jaataa he, jiske aripath main ek sandharitra diya hota he, jo sahaayak kundalan kii dhara ko mukhya kundalan kii dhara se lagbhag 10 vidyut degree visthapit kar detaa he
 This may cause the creation of rotational magnetic fields and the motor starts moving
 sandharitra ke paripath main rahane se motor kaa prachaalan shaktigunank bhi sudhar jaataa he
 Many small motors are universal and can be used in both direct current and alternating current
 vastut: ye shrenee motor hote hai, jinka prachaalan disht dhara evam prayavarti dhara donon main hi prayukt kiye ja sakate hai
 In fact, these are class motors, which can operate both in direct current and alternating current, but they can be made in very small sizes and are used only in certain applications
 metron tathaa duusare ukaranon main tathaa jahaan kisi vidyut raashi kaa maapan karnaa ho vahaan atyant chote aakaar ke motor prayukt hote hai
 Many small motors are also used for remote control, or for opening valves, etc
 motor kaa upree aavaran vibhinn paristhitiyon ke anusaar banaaya jaataa he
 Some motors are open type, in which their inner parts are visible in front, but in such motors there is a fear of getting dust
 atev ye khule sthanon main nahin prayukt kiye ja sakate
 But natural ventilation is good in such motors
 atev ye shighrata se garam nahin hone pate
 For this reason such motors are of relatively high capacity according to size
 jahaan motor ko khule sthanon main prachaalan karnaa padataa he vahaan dhul mitti ityadi kaa dar ho saktaa he, at: purnataya aavruth motor prayukt kiye jate hai
 The main difficulty in such motors is ventilation
 inkaa aavaran bhi aisa banaaya jaataa he ki vah adhiktam ooshmaa vistarit kar sake
 At the same time, there is a system of a fan mounted on the same tree, which can enter the ventilation air inside the motor and expand the heat produced in it
 adhikansh prayojanon ke liye ardh-paribaddh motor santoshjanak hote hai, jinamein motor ke drushtigochar honevaale bhaag jaali dwaara dhake rahete hai
 Thus, there are benefits of both the above types
 vishesh paristhitiyon ke liye vishesh prakaar ke aavaran banaae jate hai, jaise khaanon ke andar athwa visphotak vaataavaran main purnataya jwalarahit motor prayukt kiye jate hai
 Similarly some motors are made to work under water and their cover is designed to work and their cover is designed in such a way that water cannot get inside the motor
 or bhi bahut si vibhinn paristhitiyon main vibhinn prakaar ke aavaran banaae jate hai
 Many motors are attached directly to the load and in many cases they are attached by bar, gear or chain
 gear se chaalak evam chaalit mashiinon main lagbhag sthir chaal anupaat poshit kiya ja saktaa he or gear kram badalakar vibhinn chaalen bhi praapt kii ja sakati hai
 The machine can also be placed far enough away from the motor to transmit power through the strip, and can also run a common isha to which other machines are associated
 bade bade kaarkaanon main saadharantaya yahi vinyas hota he
 The main limitation to the capacity of motors is the increase of heat
 taap ke badhane par kshat hone kaa bhi bhay rahata he, tathaa haniyon ke bad jane se motor kii dakshata bhi kam ho jaati he
 Thus the motor cannot operate continuously
 adhikansh motor ek vishisht taap vruddhi ke liye kshamit hote hai, jo vidyutarodhi ke varg par nirbhar karata he
 Many motors are of "continuous capacity", which means that they can sustain a constant load, to a specific limit without heating
 bahut se motor keval alp kaal ke liye hi purna bhaar par prachaalan karte hai or baaki samay bahut kam bhaar par rahete hai athwa band rahete hai
 If the operation is fixed, low-capacity motors for such purposes only operate at full load for short periods of time and remain at or off load for the rest of the time
 yadi prachaalankram nishchit ho, to aise prayojanon ke liye kam kshamta kii motaren prayog kii ja sakati hai, jinka prachaalan tathaa kshamta alp samay ke liye hi nirdhaarit hoti he
 Maharishi Bhrigu was born in 5000 BC in brahmaloka-susha Nagar
 inke pardada kaa naam marichi rishi tha
 Grandfather's name was Kashyapa Rishi, grandmother's name was Aditi
 inke pita prachetha-vidhaataa jo brahmalok ke raja banane ke baad prajapita brahma kahalaaye
 His parents were the eldest son of aditi-kashyap
 maharishi bhriguji kii mata kaa naam virani devi tha
 They were two brothers siblings from their parents
 aapke bade bhai kaa naam angira rishi tha
 Whose sons were Brihaspati who is known as the priest-goddess of the gods
 maharishi bhrigu dwaara rachit jyotish granth ‘bhrigu samhita’ ke locarpan evam ganga sarayu nadiyon ke sangam ke avasar par jeevandaayini ganga nadi ke sangrakshan or yaajik parampara se maharishi bhrigu ne apane shishy darder ke sammaan main dadri mela prarambh kiya
 The mention of two wives of Maharishi Bhrigu is found in the Aarash texts
 inaki pehali patni daityon ke adhipati hiranyakashyap kii putree divya thi
 From whom your two sons were born kavya-venus and tvashta-vishwakarma respectively
 sushanagar main paidaa hue maharishi bhrigu ke donon putr vilakshan pratibha ke dhani the
 Elder sons kavya-venus were astrologers, masters of astrology, sacrificial rituals
 maatrikul main aapako acharya kii oopaadhi mili
 He became famous in the world as Shukracharya
 duusare putr twashta-vishwakarma vaastu ke nipun shilpkaar hue
 You were known as 'maya' in the matriarch monster
 apni paarangat shilp dakshata se ye bhi jagadkhyat hue
 Maharishi Bhrigu's second wife was Poulami, daughter of the sage Pulom Rishi
 inase bhi do putron chyavan or richik paidaa hue
 The elder son Chyavan was married by Muniver to Sukanya, the daughter of King Sharyati of Gujarat Bharaonch
 bhargav chyavan or sukanya ke vivaah ke saath hi bhargavon kaa himalay ke dakshin padaarpan hua
 Chyavan Rishi became the king of the Gulf of Khambhat and the region came to be known as bhrigukchha-bhrigu Kshetra
 aaj bhi bhadauch main narmada ke tat par bhrigu mandir bana he
 Maharishi Bhrigu married his second son, Ritchik, along with Satyavati, daughter of Kanyakubjapati Kaushik King Gadhi, by giving one thousand Shyamakarna horses in dowry
 ab bhargav richik bhi himalay ke dakshin gadhipuri aa gayi
 Many of the plot of Maharishi Bhrigu's arrival in this liberated area are found in the scriptures
 puranic, aitihaasik aakhyaanon ke anusaar brahma-prachetha putr bhrigu dwaara himalay ke dakshin daitya, daanav or maanav jatiyon ke raajaaon ke saath vaivaahik sambandh sthapit kar meljol badhaane se himalay ke uttar kii dev, gandharv, yaksha jatiyon ke nrivanshon main aakrosh punap rahaa tha
 All the people were blaming Vishnu, the youngest brother of Brahma, the patron of the gods
 duusare barhon adityon main bhargavon kaa prabhutv badhata ja rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, the great demon Hiranyakashyap of Maharishi Bhrigu invaded the kingdoms north of the Himalayas
 jisase maharishi bhrigu ke parivaar main vivaad hone laga
 Maharishi Bhrigu was taking the side of his brother by saying that extending the state boundary is the king's religion
 is vivaad main vishnu ji ne unki pehali patni, hiranyakashyap kii putree divya devi ko maar daalaa
 Due to this, Maharishi Bhrigu gave a kick to Shri Vishnu
 is vivaad kaa nipataara maharishi bhrigu ke pardada or vishnu ji ke dada marichi muni ne is nirnay ke saath kiya ki bhrigu himalay ke dakshin jaakar rahe
 Devganas will bear the responsibility of upbringing with respect to the sons born to their Divya Devi
 parivaar kii pratishtha-maryaada kii raksha ke liye bhrigu ji ko yah bhi aadesh mila ki vah shri hari vishnu kii aalochana nahin karenge
 In this way, Maharishi Bhrigu came to Gadhipuri with his second son Paulmi from Sushanagar to his younger son Ritchik
 maharishi bhrigu ke is kshetra main aane doosraa aakhyaan kuch dharmik granthon, puraanon main miltaa he
 Maharishi Bhrigu is the son of pracheta-brahma, according to the narratives scattered in the sections of Vishnu Purana, Agni Purana, Srimad Bhagavata, the fourth wing of Goddess Bhagavata, he was married to Khyati, daughter of Daksha Prajapati
 jinase inke do putr kavy-shukr or twashta tathaa ek putree ‘shri’ lakshmi kaa janm hua
 His daughter 'sri' was married to Shri Hari Vishnu
 daityon ke saath ho rahe devasur sangram main maharishi bhrigu kii patni khyaati jo yogashakti sampann tejasvi mahila thi
 She brought the dead soldiers of the army of demons alive with her power
 jisase naaraaz hokar srihari vishnu ne shukracharya kii mata, bhriguji kii patni khyaati kaa sir apane sudarshan chakra se kaat diya
 On knowing about the murder of his wife, Maharishi Bhrigu curses Lord Vishnu that you will have to be born again and again from the stomach of a woman
 uske baad maharishi apni patni khyaati ko apane yogabal se jivit kar ganga tat par aa jate hai, tamasa nadi kii sristi karte hai
 According to the legend of the epilogue section of the Padma Purana, in the yagna taking place at Mandarachal, there was a dispute among sages and sages who appointed Maharishi Bhrigu as the tester to test the gods
 tridevon kii pariksha lene ke kram main maharishi bhrigu sabase pehle bhagwaan shankar ke kailash pahuche us samay bhagwaan shankar apni patni sati ke saath vihaar kar rahe the
 Nandi etc
 Rudras stopped Maharishi at the entrance
 inke dwaara bhagwaan shankar se milane kii hath karne par rudraganon ne maharishi ko apamaanit bhi kar diya
 The enraged Maharishi Bhrigu declared Lord Shankar as Tamoguni and cursed him to be worshiped in the linga
 yahan se maharishi bhrigu brahmalok brahmaji ke paas pahunche
 Brahma was staying in his court
 sabhi devgan unke samaksh baithe hue the
 Brahmaji did not even ask Bhrigu to sit
 tab maharishi bhrigu ne brahmaji ko rajoguni ghoshit karte hue apoojya hone kaa shaap diya
 Maharishi Vishnulok walked in disgusted with the insults and insults found in Kailash and Brahmaloka
 bhagwaan srihari vishnu ksheer sagar main sarpakar sundar nauka par apni patni lakshmi-shri ke saath vihaar kar rahe the
 At that time Shri Vishnu ji was sleeping
 maharishi bhriguji ko laga ki hamen aata dekh vishnu sone kaa naatak kar rahe hai
 He struck his right leg on the chest of Shri Vishnu
 maharishi ke is ashisht aacharan par vishnupriya lakshmi jo srihari ke charan dabaa rahi thi, kupit ho uthi
 But Shrivishnu ji grabbed Maharishi's leg and said Bhagavan! My hard chest did not hurt your soft phase
 maharishi bhrigu lajjit bhi hue or prasann bhi, unhone srihari vishnu ko tridevon main shreshth satoguni ghoshit kar diya
 In this examination of the trinity, where a great learning is hidden
 vahiin ek bahut badi kootneeti bhi chhipi thi
 This incident created a proverb
 kshamaa badan ko chahie, chhotan ko utpaat
 Ka Hari Gaya, as Bhrigu Kari Kata
 
 The diplomacy in this event was that all the castes under the leadership of Shri Hari Vishnu were progressing to become civilized, cultured by being the organization of ethnics of the north of the Himalayas
 vahi himalay ke dakshin kaa nrivansh samudaay jinhen daitya-daanav, marut-rudra aadi naamon se janaa jaataa tha
 Even after being diligent, she was leading an unorganized, unruly life
 ye jatiyaan rudra shankar ko hi apana nayak-devtaa maanati thi
 Used to worship him only
 himalay ke dakshin main devkul nayak vishnu ko pratishthapit karne ke liye maharishi bhrigu hi sabase upyukt madhyam the
 He had a wife from Daityakul, another from the demon clan, and his sons Shukracharyas, tvashta-maya-vishwakarma and Chyavan in Bhrigukchha and Ritik in Gadhipuri were highly respected
 is tridev pariksha ke baad himalay ke dakshin main srihari vishnu kii pratishtha sthapit hone lagi
 Especially in the consecration of kings, taking the name of Shri Vishnu was considered to be a blessing and recognition of the Gods of the Himalayas
 puraanon main varnit aakhyaan ke anusaar tridevon kii pariksha main vishnu vaksh par pad prahaar karne vaale maharishi bhrigu ko dandacharya marichi rishi ne dand diya
 For which Bhriguji got a blanket in a dry bamboo stick and the deer fell from your waist
 vahi aap vishnu sahastra naam kaa jap karenge tab aapke is paap kaa mochan hoga
 While walking from Mandarachal, when Maharishi Bhrigu reached the Ganga coast of the liberated area, his deer fell and the rod exploded into a stick
 jahaan unhone tapasya karnaa prarambh kar diya
 In the course of time, this land came to be known as Bhrigukshetra in the name of Maharishi
 maharishi bhrigu jivan se jude aitihaasik, puranic or dharmik sabhi pakshon par prakaash daalane ke peeche meraa sidhaa mantavy he ki pathak swavivek kaa prayog kar saken
 The descriptions of our mystics are abundant in our religious texts, but with the same abundance, imaginary incidents have also been added to it
 unke jivan ko mahimamandit karne ke liye hamaare patuvidwaan unki aitihaasikta se khilwaad kiye hai, jiske kaaran vaishvik str par anek baar apmanjanak sthiti utpann ho jaati he
 Maharishi Bhrigu cleaned the forests here after coming to this land
 yahan maatr pashuon ke akhet par jivan yaapan kar rahe jansamanya ko kheti karnaa sikhaaya
 Here he established the Gurukul and taught the people to read and write
 us kalkhand main is bhu-bhaag ko narbhakshi maanvon kaa nivas mana jaataa tha
 The task of making them cultured, cultured human beings was done by Maharishi
 maharishi bhrigu ke pariwarik jivan se aparichit jan bhi maharishi dwaara pranit jyotish-khagol ke mahaan granth bhrigu samhita ke bare main jaanate he
 Many books with this name still appear to be sold here from literature vendors
 maharishi ne bhrigu samhita granth kii rachana apni dirghakaalin nivas kii karm bhoomi vimukt bhoomi baliya main hi kiya tha
 There are two things to note in this context
 pehali baat yah he ki apni janmabhumi brahmalok main nivas kaal main unka jivan jhanjhawaton se bharaa hua tha
 Maharishi, distressed by the death of his wife Divya Devi and expelled from the land of birth after the examination of the trinity, had the opportunity to live peacefully at the same time when he came to the liberated land
 bhrigukachha gujarat main pahuchane ke samay tak unki khyaati chaturdik fail chuki thi
 Because by that time, his Bhrigu Samhita had also gained fame and his Aryavart had also come to know about the confluence of ganga-sarayu by his disciple Dardar in Bhrigukshtra
 aakhyaanon ke anusaar khambhat kii khadi main maharishi ke pahuchane par unka rajasi abhinandan kiya gaya tha, tathaa vaidic vidwaan brahmanon ne swastivachan karte hue unhe atmagyaani jyotish ke prakand pandit ke rup main unki abhyarthna kii thi
 This proves that the Bhrigu Samhita was composed by Maharishi after his expulsion from Sushanagar and before going to Bhrigukchha in Gujarat
 maharishi kii is samhita dwaara kisi bhi jataka ke teen janmon kaa fal nikaala ja saktaa he
 Predictions of life and agriculture were also predicted through this scientific treatise of Vedic mathematics based on the planets and constellations like Sun, Moon, Mars, Buddha, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, etc
, which control this universe
 maharishi ke kalkhand main kaagaj or chapai kii suvidha uplabdh nahin thi
 Richa was memorized and its practical information was given to the disciples through the Shalakaas
 kaalaantar main jab likhane kii vidha viksit hui or uske sansaadhan masi bhojaptr taadptr aadi kaa vikaas hua, tab kuch vidwaanon ne in richaon ko lipibaddh karne kaa kaam kiya

 Uttararamacharitam is a famous Sanskrit play by Mahakavi Bhavabhuti, in seven points of which is the story of Rama's north life
 bhawabhooti ek safal naatakkaar hai
 In Uttararamacharitam, he has selected a history related to such a hero who is the soul of Indian culture
 is kathanak kaa aakarshan bharat ke saath saath videshi janamanas main bhi sadaa se rahaa he or rahegaa
 With his writing tact, the poet removed the flaw of the character of abandonment of Rama's wife forever
 saath hi sita ko vanvaas dene vaale ram kaa rudan dikhaakar kavi ne sita ke apamaanit tathaa dukh bhare hriday ko bahut shant kiya hai
 In literature, where there is a law for the predominance of Shringar or Veer Ras in plays, the same Bhavabhuti brought a unique revolution in the Natyajatas, by writing Karun Ras Pradhan plays opposite him
 bhawabhooti to yahon tak kehete hai ki karun hi ekmaatr ras he
 The same compassion is expressed in other forms through distinction
 vivaah se purv nayak nayika kaa shringaar varnan to praayah sabhi kaviyon ne safalataa ke saath kiya he parantu bhawabhooti ne daampaty prem kaa jaisaa ujjwal evam vishad chitra khinchaa he vaisaa anyatra dularbh he
 The Uttararamcharitam composed in seven digits is the best drama of Bhavabhuti
 isamen raamarajyamishek ke pashchaat jivan kaa lokottar charit varnit he jo mahaviracharit kaa hi uttar bhaag mana jaataa he
 
 sanskrit natyasahitya main maryadapurshottam shri ramachandra ke paavan charitra se sambaddh anek naatak he kintu unamem bhawabhooti kaa uttarram charitam apana ek alag hi vaishishty rakhata he
 In poetry poetry where Shringar or Veer Rasa predominates in plays, Bhavabhuti has created an incomparable revolution in theatrical world by creating Karun Rasa-based drama opposite him
 uttarramcharitam main prem kaa jaisaa shuddh rup dekhne ko miltaa he vaisaa anya kaviyon kii krittiyon main durlabh he
 Through this drama, the poet has presented the ideal form of the king, who is the idol of selfishness and sacrifice, and Prajranjan is the main religion
 praja sukh ke liye pranpriya patni kaa bhi tyaag karne main jise koi hichak nahin he
 In this play, more than the description of the soft and sweet form of nature, its serious and severe form has been described which are unique and embellished
 vastav main yah naatak anya naatakon kii tulana main niraala hi he
 That is why it has a special place in the Sanskrit theater world
 saar rup main yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki vishwaas kii mahima main, prem kii pavitrataa main, bhaawanaaon kii tarangakreeda main, bhashaa ke gambheery main or hriday ke mahatmaya main uttarramcharitam shreshth evam athulaneey naatak he
 Rama abandons Sita despite not wanting due to massacre
 sitatyag ke baad virahi ram kii dasha kaa tritiy ank main karun chitra prastut kiya gaya he, jo kavy kii drushti se is naatak kii jaan he
 Bhavabhuti has inscribed the ideal form of romantic love in this voyeur
 komal evam kathor bhaavon kii ruchir vyanjana, romantic or bhayaavah prakruti chitron kaa kushal ankan is naatak kii visheshtaayen hai
 The dynamics of dramatic trade in Uttararamcharit is relaxed and it is more reflective of poetry and lyrical drama than drama drama
 bhawabhooti kii bhavukta or paandityapurna style kaa charam paripaak is kriti main purnat: lakshith hota he

 The set of gross works related to dictionary formation is called koshakarma or lexicography
 vishyon kii drushti se shabdkoshon ke varg yaa vibhaag bananaa kathin he
 Different Kokhars used to create such subjects according to their understanding
 unka na to koi nishchit kram hota tha or na ho hi saktaa tha
 So people often had to memorize the entire dictionary
 isi kaaran paashchaatya deshon main shabdkosh aksharkram se banane lage
 There was no need to rote such a dictionary and he could use it as and when required
 aajkal praaia: sabhi deshon or sabhi bhashaaon main kosh ke kshetra me isi kram ko prayog hone laga he : jo jigyaasu kii drushti se sabase adhik subhite kaa hota hai
 That's why alphabet is often used in all types of thesaurus
 yon to kosh ke anek prakaar hote hai, par arth ke vichaar se ve do bhaagon main baante ja sakate hai
 One is those in which meanings and interpretations of the words of a language are in the same language and other in which the meanings of the words of one language are given in another language or languages
 vishay ke vichaar se kosh anek prakaar ke ho sakate hai, jaise-ganit kosh, vidhik kosh, vaidyak kosh, sahitya kosh aadi
 Such dictionaries are often counted in terms such as agricultural terminology, philosophical terminology, geographical terminology etc
 inke sivaa kuch vishisht kaviyon, boliyon aadi ke bhi alag alag kosh hote hai, jaise-tulsi kosh, sur kosh, avadhi kosh, brajabhasha kosh aadi
 The main symbols, topics or words that contain thesaurus or tables in important texts of a particular subject are called successive metaphorical index, subject index or concordance
 koshrachana ek kala he
 Knowledge of this art can be obtained by studying the dictionaries of the most advanced languages of the present era with a subtle view
 achche or pramanik koshon kaa sampadan tab tak keval vidwata ke bal par nahin ho saktaa, jab tak koshrachana kii kala kaa bhi puraa puraa gyaan na ho or is kala kaa gyaan koshon ke jivanavyapee adhyayan se hi ho saktaa he
 All types of thesaurus are made only for the fulfillment of a particular purpose and the need of a particular area
 at: koshrachana main mukhyat: isi uddeshy yaa aavashyaktaa kaa dhyaan rakhana padataa hai
 Secondly, one has to keep in mind that his entire body is balanced in all respects; It is not that an organ grows more than it needs or justification, and someone seems to be weak or inferior in comparison
 shabdon kaa vivechan bhi or us vivechan ke angon kaa kram bhi sadaa ek sa rahanaa chahie
 Words also have castes or classes, so all the words of a caste or class should have the same interpretation
 yadi pramanik granthon athwa lekhakon ke udhaaharan liye jaae, to unka utana hi ansh lenaa chahie, jitne main aashay spasht ho sake or jigyaasu kaa samaadhaan ho jaae
 Good dictionaries also contain terminology for all types of fields and subjects
 isaliye sampadak kaa adhik se adhik vishyon kaa saamaanya gyaan yaa bodh hona chahie
 When needed, it is necessary to seek help from a good and authentic book of an unknown or new subject or even from a good writer
 koshrachana ke kaary main drushti bahut vyapak rakhana chahie or vritti madhukaari honi chahie
 The vision should be so sharp and subtle that it can easily make sense of Neer Ksheer and by finding old errors, faults, mistakes, etc
, it can be easily corrected and corrected
 koshkar main pakshpaat yaa rogadwesh naam ko bhi nahin rahanaa chahie
 Its sole purpose should be to serve language and literature
 koshon main pradhanta arthon or vivechanon kii hi hoti he, at: unamem kahin vyapti yaa ativyapti nahin rahani chahie
 All things should be brief, nappy and moderate as much as possible
 kosh main adhik se adhik or thos jaankaree kam se kam shabdon main prastut karke hi jaani chahie
 There is no place in the dictionary for unnecessary or recruitment matters
 shabdon ke kuch rup to maanak hote hai or bahut se rup sthanik yaa prantiy hote hai
 The spatial or provincial words of which the standard forms are received should be interpreted within the same standard words and their standard or provincial forms should be mere reference to their standard forms
 isse bahut bada laabh yah hota he ki anya bhashaa-bhashiyon ko sahaj main shabdon ke maanak rup kaa pataa chal jaataa he or bhashaa kaa maanak rup sthir hone main sahaayta milti he-aparichiton ke dwaara bhashaa kaa rup sahasaa bigadane nahin paata
 The same thing should be done with regard to Sanskrit words which have many synonyms
 jaise camel, nadi, parvat, samudr aadi
 While giving their synonyms in front of words, it should also be kept in mind that only those synonyms should be given the exact meaning or measure of the original word
 jin paryaayon ke kaaran kuch bhi bhram utpann ho saktaa ho, un paryaayon kaa aise prasangon main parityag karnaa hi shreyaskar hoga
 Recently, Webster's New World Dictionary has set a new model in front of lexicographers, which is very useful and useful for dictionaries, because they are very useful and useful
 usamen anek shabdon ke antargat unase milte julate paryaayon ke sookshm antar bhi dikhalaae gaye hai, yatha - feare ke antargat dred, friete, elarm, disme, teror or painic ke sookshm antar bhi batala die gaye hai
 It has been done in such a way that the work of the lexicon is not finished by conveying the meaning of the words, but even beyond this, its job is to tell people the correct use of the words
 hamaare yahan aise saikadon hajaaron shabd milenge, jinke parsparik sookshm antar batalaaye ja sakate hai or is prakaar jigyaasuon ko shabdon par nae dhang se vichaar karne kaa abhyaas karaayaa ja saktaa he
 There is another new and useful practice in recent good and big English dictionaries, which can be particularly useful for Indian language dictionaries
 praaia: sabhi bhashaaon main bahut se aise yogic shabd hote hai jo upsarg lagaakar bana liye jate hai
 Junior to Junior, Causal to Indeterminate, Expected to Unexpected, Necessary to Unnecessary, Minister to Deputy Minister, Committee to Subcommittee, Adherence to Compliance, Excursion from Cruise, Reaction to Karma, Legislation from Legislation etc
 upsargon ke yoga se bananevaale aise shabdon kii sankhya bahut adhik hoti he
 Such words are divided into two classes or can be divided
 ek to aise shabd jinke shabd purv pad tathaa uttar pad mil kar bhi kisi nae yaa vishisht arth se yukt nahin hote or isi liye saadhaaran shabdon ke antargat rahete hai
 Such words and their meanings greatly increase the level of the dictionary
 is prakaar ke vyarth vistaar se bachane ke liye webster ke nae koshon main yah nai paddati apanaai gai he ki unhen swatantra shabd nahin maanate or isi liye unke arth bhi nahin liye gaye hai
 At the end of the page, a list of such words is given below a line, as-un-destined, un-disturbed, un-free, un-hurt, un-invoked etc
 haan, inke vipareet duusare varg ke kuch aise shabd avashya hote hai jinamein upsargon ke yoga se kuch nae arth nikalate hai
 As in the adjective form, the form of Achcha is hairless, but in noun form it is also a name for the planet Ketu
 anagaar kaa arth bina ghar-barwaala to he hi, par sangya rup main vah sanyasi kaa bhi vaachak he
 Therefore it is necessary to take such words
 jin shabdon ke arth purvpad or utaarpad ke yoga se swat: nasht ho jate hon, unhen koshon main arthsahit lenaa vyarth hi samajha jane laga he
 Therefore, it would be sufficient to just give a list of such words in the page
 haan, jin yogic shabdon main donon padon ke yoga se koi nayaa or vishesh arth nikalataa ho, unhen yathasthaan arthsahit lenaa to aavashyak he hi
 The method of our old Sanskrit dictionary has been that the words formed by the sum of ati, prati, etc
 are given together under the same title under their former term
 hindi ke kuch koshon ne bhi is pratha kaa anukaran kiya he
 Although this method is rational from the point of view of Sanskrit grammar, even in Sanskrit dictionaries, it does not appear to be fully followed
 isamen sthaan kii kuch bachat avashya hoti he, par asaadhaaran pathakon ke liye shabd dhoondhna bahut kathin ho jaataa he
 Sometimes it is difficult to find words from this method even for people who are very familiar with its rules and principles
 prayek bhashaa main kuch shabd aise hote hai jo alag alag arthon ke vichaar se avyay, kriyavisheshan, visheshan, pratyay sangya aadi bhi hote hai or alag alag mulon se bhi vyutpann hote hen, yatha hindi ko aan shabd sangya bhi he, visheshan bhi or pratyay bhi
 In its noun form, it is derived from a few different origins in many of its meanings
 aise shabd aadhunik or shreshth angareji koshon main alag or swatantra shabd maane jate hai or unke alag alag sheershak rakhkar unka vivechan kiya jaataa he, yatha-angareji main waayiz visheshan bhi he, sangya bhi or pratyay bhi or teenon roopon main uske sheershak alag alag rakhe gaye hai
 If they are also followed in the lexicons of Indian languages, it will be very good in many respects

 sanhedrin trial of jesus ke aadhyatmik vivaranon ke anusaar yishu kaa crucification sambhawatah kisi shuukravaar ko kiya gaya tha
 The approximate year of Good Friday according to two different classes is AD 33, while Isaac Newton calculated that year to be basically AD 34, based on the difference between the Bible and the Julian calendar and the size of the moon

 "the High Priest convicts Jesus of blasphemy and sentenced Jesus to death at the Sanhedrin hearing in the case of Jesus with unanimous consent
