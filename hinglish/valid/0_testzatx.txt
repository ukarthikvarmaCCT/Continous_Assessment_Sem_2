 Justin Henin is a Belgian professional female tennis player
 From 2002 to 2007, he was named Justin Henin Harden
 varsh 2007 main unke vivaah sabandh viched ke baad unka naam phir se justin henin ho gaya | justin kaa janm 1 june 1982 ko belgium ke lij shahar main hua tha
 He returned to professional tennis again in September 2009, after his sudden retirement on 14 May 2008
 justin ne ab tak 41 WTA ekal kitaab jite hai | iske atirikt unhone saat grend slam mukaable jite hai, jiname chaar french open, ek amareeki open or ek australian open shaamil hai | justin ne varsh 2004 kaa olympic swarna padak bhi jeeta he | a code of conduct is a group of social behavior, rules and responsibilities prescribed for an individual, party or organization
 ke santhanam kii adhyakshata main gathit bhrashtachar nirodhak samiti kii siforeeshon ke aadhaar par lok sevaaon main satyanishtha banaae rakhane kii drushti se sarkari karmchaariyon ke aacharan niyamon ko sanshodhit kiya gaya or kendra sarkaar ke karmchaariyon ke liye aachaar samhita banaate hue kendriya civil sevaayen niyamavali, 1964 adhishuchet kii gai thi
 The bilingual version of the Central Civil Service Rules, 1964 was published in 1986 and no version has been published since then
 isi bich niyamon ke kai upbandh sanshodhit kiye gaye hai or anek spashtikaran bhi jari kiye gaye hai
 Following are the rules of conduct related to public servants in India: - sthanapann maatrutiv yaa 'sarogsi' ek aisa kaary he jisame nari apni garbhavastha kisi or anurvar dampati ke liye leti he
 In the present era, the use of this reaction has been quite famous
 sambhavit sarogat mataao; antararashtriya maang or chikitsa kii sulabh uplabdhiyon ne hi is kshetra ko sweekaarya or prasiddh banaaya he
 The surrogacy process has also received considerable hits in the media
 anginat agenciyaan tathaa clinico ne is prakriya ko prajnan karne ke liye kholaa he
 Thus, the fertility factor has become quite jealous
 kabhi kabhi, sarogsi ko jivan bitaane kaa tarika mana gaya he
 Although, in general, surrogacy has also become a way of life
 sarogat maatrutiv kaa abhyaas ek lambaa itihaas rahaa he or ise kai samskritiyon main sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The story between Ibrahim, Sarah, and Hagar, and the story of Rachel and the servant in the book, "old Testament", establish that substitute motherhood was accepted in Jewish society
 haalanki, europea samskritiyon main sarogsi nihsandeh abhyaas kiya gaya he parantu ateet main ise saamaajik or kanoonee niyamon ke tahat aupchaarik rup se sweekaar nahin kiya gaya tha
 In traditional societies, the surrogate mother gives her child as 'charity' but in Western societies the surrogate mother 'removes' her child
 kai samajo main sarogsi, dosti or sajjanta ke rup main bhi dekhne ko miltaa he
 Surrogacy was informally present in Australia until the last century
 austrilia ke pehle sarogsi kaa maamla 1988 main hua tha
 Alice Kirkman, the first EVF baby to be born by this process, was born on 23 May 1988 in Melbourne
 haal hi me, march 1996 main austrilia ke 'pehla kanoonee vyavastha' kaa soochna mili thi
 At that time, a woman allowed her brother and sister-in-law's genetic embryo to grow in her womb vessel
 is maamla ko, austrilian kapital teritori kanoon ke tahat main aage badhane diya gaya
 With the birth of this child, there was a storm of media interest and questions related to surrogacy
 bhartiya samaaj serogesi ko asweekaar karata he 
 Because someone else's child thrives in someone else's womb
 bhartiya samaaj ke anusaar stri tathaa purush tabhi sambhog kar sakate he jab ve pati patni ho 
 Apart from husband, women cannot take semen of any other person and cannot become pregnant with anyone else
 bhartiya samaaj ke anusaar yadi kisi danpati ko santan kii prapti nahi ho rahi ho to unhen baccha god le lenaa chahie 
 reproductive-technology-bill / article5380425
ece as ART Regulation draft bill], it is not yet passed
 is bill dwaara sthanapann maatratv ke saare pramaan patron ko kanoonee niyamon ke anusaar swikrat kiya gaya he
 The contracts of surrogacy process can be treated as equivalent to other contracts by the Indian Contract Act
 akele janak yaa mata-pita or saroget maan saare nirgamanon tathaa samasyaon par ek anubdhan banaate hue is prakriya ko kanoon ke madhyam se pravartaneey banaaya he
 The surrogate mother must be 21-35 years of age and she will not be allowed to undergo [transfer] more than 3 times for the same couple
 yadi saroget vivaahit ho to pati ke sahamati anivaary he taaki bhavishya main vaivaahik vivaadon ko taal saken
 The surrogate should be screened for sexually transmitted diseases and should receive blood transfusion in the last 6 months as it can cause adverse effects on mother and baby during pregnancy
 saroget maan kii chikitsa kaa beemaa, garbhavastha tathaa bachche kii janm se sambhandhit or anya uchit kharch sahit kharchon, mata-pita dwaara vahan kii janaa chahie
 a life insurance cover for a surrogate mother should be included
 saroget maan ko bacchon par kisi bhi abhibhavik adhikaar nahin hona chahie or bachche ke janm pramaan patr par saroget maan kii naam nahin hona chahie taaki bhavishya main janm adhikaar main koi kanoonee kalah na ho
 The parent is obliged by law to accept the child's custody
 atyant gupt hameshaa banaae rakhaa janaa chahie or daata ke niztaa ke adhikaar kii raksha kii jaani chahie
 Christianity is not unanimous in his opinion of the surrogate mother
 catholic jirah ek bachche kii haq nahin balki ek uphaar mana jaataa he or 'ek maance' siddant ke anusaar sarogsi asweekaarya he
 Surrogacy related questions in Protestant denominations are low deductions and fees
 protestant carch ise udaar drushti se dekha jaataa he
 Conservative rabbis have been considered surrogacy process, mere disrespect and degrading
 yah saroget maan tathaa mata-pita ke bich kaa anternirhit asantulan tathaa aarthik matbhed ko prakashit karata he
 But to overcome the suffering of barrenness of people, they sometimes accept it
 islam viddhanon sharia kanoon ke nazaraiye se sarogsi prakriya ko asweekaar karte hue kahata he ki paidaa honevaamle bachche ko nyaaypurv vansh nahin mil saktaa he kyoki tisare vyakti ke kul bhi jude he
 This process has been favored by Mussalmano for development
 hindu dharm vishesh paristhitiyon main banjarapan or kritrim garbhadaan ko anubhuti deti he
 And in this, we use the sperm of the father so that the child has his own pet
 bauddha dharm is prakriya ko sweekaar nahi kiya he kyoki baudd dharm main man jaataa he ki yadi santanotpatti na ho to anaath bachche ko god lenaa chahie

 aitarey upanishad ek shukla rigvedic upanishad he
 Under the Rigvedic Aitareya Aranyaka, the chapters 4, 5 and 6
 of the Second Aranyaka are named Aitareopanishad
 yah upanishad brahmavidyapradhan he
 The commentary written by Lord Shankaracharya on this is very important
 iske upodghaat-bhashya main unhone moksh ke hetu kaa nirnay karte hue karm or karmsamucchit gyanaka niraakaran kar keval gyanako hi uskaa ekmaatr saadhan batalaata he
 Then, he has decided the right to knowledge and with a big ceremony, dismantling the right of rituals, he has appointed the monk as his officer
 vahaan ve kehete hai ki ‘grihasthashram’ apane grihavisheshke parigrah kaa naam he or yah kaamanaayon ke rahete hue hi ho saktaa he tathaa gyani main kaamanaayon kaa sarvatha abhaav hota he
 Therefore, if someone becomes enlightened in the house of labor due to any kind of Chitta-purification, then even if he is unhappy, due to the lack of accession of his home-state, he will automatically get alms
 acharya kaa mat he ki ‘yavajjivamagnihotran juhoti’ aadi shrutiyaan keval agyaniyon ke liye hai, bodhvan ke liye is prakaar kii koi vidhi nahin kii ja sakati
 In this way, by showing the imperative of Parivrajya for the scholar, they also make their imperative for the curious
 iske liye unhone ‘shaanton dant uparatastitikshuh’ ‘atyashramibhyah paraman pavitran provach samyagrushisanghajushtam’ ‘karmana na prajaya dhanen tyagenaike amritatvamanshuh’ aadi shruti or ‘gyatva naishkarmyamacharet’ ‘brahmashramapade vaset’ aadi smritiyon ko uddhrut kiya he
 Even for Brahmajigyanasu Brahmachari, while doing the Chaturthashrama, Acharya says that it cannot be suspected that he does not have the right to retire without retiring the debtors; Because it is not possible to be indebted before accepting home labor
 atah acharya kaa siddhanth he ki jise aatmatatvaki jigyaasa he or jo saadhy-sadhnarup anitya sansar se mukti hona chahta he, vah kisi bhi ashram main ho, use sansar grahan karnaa hi chaiye
 The main basis of this principle is two
 atah gyanopayogini saadhan-sampatti ko uparjan karnaa tathaa kaamanaayon kaa abhaav-ye hi grihatyag ke mukhya hetu hai
 Those who live in the house can become rich in shammaadi and the Bodhwans, who do not have the right to remain in their home, can do enlightenment and protect knowledge even while living at home
 ve swaroop se sanyasi na honaper bhi vastutah sanyasadharmasmpann hone ke kaaran acharya ke mat kaa hi anusaran karne vaale hai
 In reality
 is upanishad main teen adhyay hai
 Among them, the first chapter has three sections and the second and third chapters have only one section each
 pratham adhyay main yah batalaya gaya he ki sristi ke armbh main keval ek aatma hi tha, uske atirikt or kuch nahin tha usne lok-rachana ke liye ikshan kiya or keval sakalp se ambh, marichi or mar teen lokonki rachana kii
 Creating them, he thought of creating a lokpalok for him, and enlivened him by creating a male
 paramatma ke sankalp se hi us virat purush indriya golak or indriyaadhishthata dev utpann ho gayi
 When he came to this Mahasamudra, the god of sensuality, God made him hungry and thirsty
 tab unhone prarthana kii ki hamen koi bhi aisa aaytan pradaan kiya jaay jisamen sthit hokar ham ann-bhakshan kar saken
 God presented Gauka's body to him, but he rejected it by saying 'this is not enough for us'
 tatpashchaat ghode kaa sharir laayaa gaya kintu vah bhi asweekrut hua
 In the end, God brought the human body to them
 use dekhakar sabhi devataaon ne ek swar main unka anumodan kiya or ve sab paramatma kii ajna se uske bhinn-bhinn avyavon main vaak, praan, chakshu aadi rupase sthati ho gayi
 Then food was made for them
 ann dekhakar bhaagane laga
 The gods wanted to receive him for different reasons due to speech, life, and hearing; But they did not succeed in it
 ant main unhone use apandwar grahan kar liya
 In this way, after all this creation happened, God thought that now i too should enter it; Because without me this whole travesty is irrational
 atah vah us purush kii moordhasimako videernkar uske dwaara usamen pravesh kiya kar gaya
 In this way, when attained, he becomes identified with the ghosts
 peeche jab gurukripaase bodh honaper use apane sarvavyaapak shuddh swaroop kaa saakshaatkaar hota he to use ‘idam’- is tarah aparokshrup se dekhne ke kaaran uski ‘indra’ sangya ho jaati he
 In this way, the creation that has been told since the entrance of the divine to the divine, is what Vidyaranyaswamy has called God creation
 eekshanadipraveshaantah sansar ishkalpitah
 Many strange things are seen in this story
 yon to maaya main koi bhi baat kutuhljanak nahin hua karti; tathaapi acharya kaa to kathan he ki yah keval arthwaad he
 It is intended to enlighten
 yah keval aatma ke adwitiyatv kaa bodh karaane ke liye hi kahi gayi he; kyonki samast sansar atmaaka hi sankalp honeke kaaran aatmaswaroop hi he
 In the beginning of the second spirituality, by doing the same way, the linguist has given a very beautiful and reasonable discussion of the spirituality
 is adhyay main atmagyaan ke hetubhoot vairaygy kii siddhike liye jeev kii teen avasthaaon kaa, jinhen pratham adhyayame ‘aavasth’’ namase kaha he, varnan kiya gaya he
 Three births of creatures are considered - ‘aatma vai putranamsi’ is shruti ke anusaar pita or putr kaa abhed he; isiliye pita ke punarjanm ko bhi putraka tritiy janm batalaaya gaya he
 The sage Vamdev told the experience of his many births while he was in the womb and it was said that i have been imprisoned in hundreds of bodies like iron fortresses; But now, having attained enlightenment, i have come out after piercing them like a chyen bird
 aisa gyaan hone ke kaaran hi vamdev rishi dehpaat ke anantar amar pad ko praapt ho gayi the
 Therefore, the soul is the only means to achieve immortality from ghosts and senses etc
 is prakaar dwitiya adhyayame atmagyaan ko parampad-praptika ekmaatr saadhan batalaakar tisare adhyayame usee kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 There it has been told that the heart mind, cognition, ignorance, science, intelligence, vision, dhrita, mati, manisha, juti, smriti, sankalpa, kratu, asu kama and tame - all these are names of wisdom
 yah pragyan hi brahma, indra, prajapati, samast devgan, paschmahabhoot tathaa udijj, swedaj andj or jarayuj aadi sab prakaar jeev-jantu hai
 This is the elephant, horse, man and the whole real world
 is prakaar yah sara sansar pragyanamen sthiti he, pragnanse hi prerit honevaala he or swayan bhi pragnanswaroop hi he, tathaa pragyan hi brahm he
 One who knows in this way becomes immortal by reversing from this world and reaching all the desires in that God

 Among these, Karporamanjari is the quintessential and adult work

 Abhinavagupta, the commentator of the Natyashastra, first defined Sattaka and placed it near the 'natika'

 Sattakas are often named after their heroines
 vaidic sahitya kaa yah mahatvapurn shabd rugveda kii samhita main geet yaa mantra ke arth main prayukt hua he

 The power of words made from the word saga is a list of its multiple uses

 Rijugath is meant purely for the recital of mantras and Gathin is meant only in the sense of a singer

 12) in teenon shabdon ke arth ke vishay main vidwaanon main matbhed he
 The commentator Sayan equates these three words with certain mantras of the Atharvaveda
 atharvaveda ke 20wein cond, 127wein sookt kaa 12vaan mantra gaatha; isi sookt kaa 1-3 mantra narashansi tathaa 4-6 mantra raibhi batalaaya gaya he
 Doctor Oldenburg considers this equation to be faulty in the view of the Rigveda, but in the view of Dr
 Bloomfield, this equation has been accepted in the Rakha Samhita
 brahman samhita ke anushilan se gaatha ke lakshan or swaroop par paryaapt prakaash padataa he
 In the eyes of Aitareya Brahmana, the saga deals with human beings in a variety of mantras, while Ritch belongs to Dev
 arthath gaatha maanviya hone se or rich daivi hone se paraspar bhinn tathaa pruthak mantra he
 This fact is confirmed by the word Shatagatham used for the Shun: Shep narrative, as Shun: Shep was a human being by being the son of a sage Ajigarta, whose story is given in many Suktas in the Rigveda
 in sookhton ke mantron kii sankhya sau ke aasapaas he isaliye aitarey brahman kii drushti main gaatha shabd manushya tathaa manuyochit vishyon ke dyotak mantra ke liye spashtat: prayukt hua he
 Aitareya considers the Aranyaka saga to be a type of different and separate mantra from Ritch and Kumbya which gives sufficient indication of the saga being composed
 varnya vishay kii drushti se gaathaayen, yadhyapi dharm se sambhddha vishyon kii abhivyakti ke kaaran dharmik hi hai, parantu vedon ke saanskarik sahitya main rich yajush tathaa saaman kii tulana main avaidic kahi gai hai arthath is yug main ye mantra nahin maani jaatin
 The Maitrayani Samhita states that the saga provides joy at the time of marriage and many gathas have been given in the Grihyasutras which were sung on Veena on the auspicious occasion of marriage
 aitarey brahman ke andra mahabhishek ke prasang main yajna main vishaal daan denevaale tathaa vishisht purohiton ke dwaara abhishikt kiye jane vaale prasiddh raajaaon kii stuti main anek pracheen gaathaayen uddhrut kii gai hai jo puraanon ke tattat, prasang main bhi uplabdh hoti hai
 The Satapatha Brahmin also has such donative stories safe
 pichley yug main gaatha tathaa narashansi richaayen praaia: samanarthak hi maani jane lageen, parantu mulat: donon main parthaky he
 The saga is the general designation of lyrical mantras under which it is perfectly justifiable to assume the presence of Narasanshi
 is tathy kii pushti aitarey aaranyak ke sayan bhashya se hoti he
 Sayan has given an example of the saga of Pratahr Anatrante Vdanti here in the morning, which is clearly not Narasanshi
 gaatha kii bhashaa vaidic mantron kii bhashaa se bhinn he
 There is a complete absence of odd grammatical forms of Veda and the simplification of verses is expressly expressed
 gaathaon ke katipay udaahranon se yah spasht ho jaataa he : This mantra has come under the famous Kutap Sukta, but its style and type of theme are proving it saga
 aitarey brahman main raja dushyant ke putr bharat se sambhddha gaatha main : Here, despite being named as Shloka, it is in the ancient saga which goes on to the Puranas derived from the tradition
 aisi kitni hi gaathaayen brahman granthon main udadhrut kii gai he
 In Jainism and Buddhism, Padya Gatha is also famous for presenting the findings of the teachings of Mahavira and Gautama Buddha
 jain gaathaayen ardhamagadhi main tathaa buddha gaathaayen pali bhashaa main hai
 We cannot deprive them of the pride of being the mouth-watering words of those great men
 tathagat kii aisi hi upadeshmayi gaathaon kaa lokapriy sangrah dhammapad he tathaa jaatakon kii katha kaa saar prastut karanevaali gaathaayen praaia: prayek jataka ke ant main uplabdh hoti hi hai
 Like the Sanskrit Arya, the saga in Pali and Prakrit also signifies a specific verse
 thergatha tathaa therigatha kii gaathaon main ham sansar ke bhoga vilaas kaa parityag kar sannyast jivan bitaanevaale theron tathaa theriyon kii maarmik anubhutiyon kaa sankalan pate hai
 The recent Gaha Sattasai Prakrit has a very fine Manjul and Saras collection of books, but the relationship of the saga is also very intimate in the Avesta treatise of the Parsis

 The main features of Mahasanagakas are: 1980 ke antim dashak main bharat ko america ne cre super computer dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 The intention of America to maintain its dominance was believed to be because it was a period when the technological revolution had started in India and China
 aise main, america nahin chahta tha ki vishwa main koi duusari shakti takanic ke maamle main uske mukaable main khadi ho
 Since rocket launch using supercomputers facilitates calculations at the time of a nuclear explosion, the US was also afraid that it would give India a new look to its nuclear power propagation program

 NOW LET'S MOVE AHEAD & KNOW MORE ABOUT THE EULER'S FORMULA
 LETS KNOW ABOUT ITS HISTORY AS MENTIONED BELOW :-euler's formula was proven for the first time by Roger Cotes in 1714 in the form 
 It was Euler who published the equation in its current form in 1748, basing his proof on the infinite series of both sides being equal
 Neither of these men saw the geometrical interpretation of the formula: the view of complex numbers as points in the complex plane arose only some 50 years later 
 Euler considered it natural to introduce students to complex numbers much earlier than we do today
 In his elementary algebra text book, Elements of Algebra, he introduces these numbers almost at once and then uses them in a natural way throughout
 This formula can be interpreted as saying that the function eix traces out the unit circle in the complex number plane as x ranges through the real numbers
 Here, x is the angle that a line connecting the origin with a point on the unit circle makes with the positive real axis, measured counter clockwise and in radians
 The original proof is based on the Taylor series expansions of the exponential function ez and of sin x and cos x for real numbers x 
 In fact, the same proof shows that Euler's formula is even valid for all complex numbers z
 a point in the complex plane can be represented by a complex number written incartesian coordinates
 Euler's formula provides a means of conversion between cartesian coordinates and polar coordinates
 The polar form reduces the number of terms from two to one, which simplifies the mathematics when used in multiplication or powers of complex numbers
 Any complex number z = x + iy can be written as where φ { \ displaystyle \ phi \ ,} is the argument of z — ie, the angle between the x axis and the vector z measured counterclockwise and in radians — which is defined up to addition of 2π
 Now, taking this derived formula, we can use Euler's formula to define the logarithm of a complex number
 To do this, we also use the definition of the logarithm that and that both valid for any complex numbers a and b
 Therefore, one can write: for any z ≠ 0 { \ displaystyle z eq 0} 
 Taking the logarithm of both sides shows that: and in fact this can be used as the definition for the complex logarithm
 The logarithm of a complex number is thus a multi-valued function, because φ { \ displaystyle \ phi \ ,} is multi-valued
 Finally, the other exponential law which can be seen to hold for all integers k, together with Euler's formula, implies several trigonometric identities as well as de Moivre's formula
 Euler's formula provides a powerful connection between analysis and trigonometry, and provides an interpretation of the sine and cosine functions as weighted sums of the exponential function: The two equations above can be derived by adding or subtracting Euler's formulas: and solving for either cosine or sine
 These formulas can even serve as the definition of the trigonometric functions for complex arguments x
 For example, letting x = iy, we have: Complex exponentials can simplify trigonometry, because they are easier to manipulate than their sinusoidal components
 One technique is simply to convert sinusoids into equivalent expressions in terms of exponentials
 After the manipulations, the simplified result is still real-valued
 For example: Another technique is to represent the sinusoids in terms of the real part of a more complex expression, and perform the manipulations on the complex expression
 For example: This formula is used for recursive generation of a sinusoid at intervals of x radians
 In differential equations, the function eix is often used to simplify derivations, even if the final answer is a real function involving sine and cosine
 Euler's identity is an easy consequence of Euler's formula
 In electrical engineering and other fields, signals that vary periodically over time are often described as a combination of sine and cosine functions, and these are more conveniently expressed as the real part of exponential functions with imaginary exponents, using Euler's formula
 Also, phasor analysis of circuits can include Euler's formula to represent the impedance of a capacitor or an inductor
 In general, raising e to a positive integer exponent has a simple interpretation in terms of repeated multiplication of e
 Raising e to zero or a negative integer exponent can be understood as repeated division
 a rational number exponent can be defined by radicals of e, and an irrational number exponent can be defined by finding rational-number exponents that are arbitrarily close to the irrational-number exponent, in a limit process
 However, to define and understand a complex number exponent of e, a different type of generalization is required for the concept of exponentiation
 In fact, several definitions are possible
 All of them can be proven to be well-defined and equivalent, although the proofs are not included in this article
 It is well-known that, for any real x, the following series is equal to ex: 
 This invites the following definition of ez for complex z: This can be proven to be well-defined; in particular, the series converges for any z
 a simple-to-state, equivalent definition is that ez, for complex z, is the analytic continuation of the function ex for real x
 This can be proven to be well-defined; in particular, it yields a single-valued function on the complex plane
 It is well-known that, for any real x, the following limit is equal to ex: This motivates the following definition of ez for complex z: For real x, the function f = ex is well-known to be the unique real function satisfying the differential equation: for all x
 This motivates a definition of f=ez for complex z as the function that satisfies the differential equation: for all complex z, where the derivative in f 'is defined in the sense of a complex derivative
 This can be proven to yield a unique function which is well-defined everywhere on the complex plane
 We would expect the function ez to have the following properties: It turns out that this uniquely specifies a function on the complex plane
 Various proofs of this formula are possible
 The first proof below starts with the "taylor series definition" of ez, while the other two use the "differential equation definition" of ez 
 Here is a proof of Euler's formula using Taylor series expansionsas well as basic facts about the powers of i: and so on
 The functions ex, cos x and sin x of the variable x can be expressed using their Taylor expansions around zero: For complex z we define each of these functions by the above series, replacing the real variable x with the complex variable z
 This is possible because the radius of convergence of each series is infinite
 We then find that The rearrangement of terms is justified because each series is absolutely convergent
 Taking z = x to be a real number gives the original identity as Euler discovered it
 Define the function ƒ, of real variable x, as The derivative of ƒ, according to the product rule, is: Therefore, ƒ must be a constant function in x
 Because ƒ is known, the constant that ƒ equals for all real x is also known
 Thus, Multiplying both sides by eix and using it follows that Q
E
D
 Define the function g by Considering that i is constant, the first and second derivatives of g are because i 2 = −1 by definition
 From this the following 2nd-order linear ordinary differential equation is constructed: or Being a 2nd-order differential equation, there are two linearly independent solutions that satisfy it: Both cos and sin are real functions in which the 2nd derivative is identical to the negative of that function
 Any linear combination of solutions to a homogeneous differential equation is also a solution
 Then, in general, the solution to the differential equation is for any constants a and B
 But not all values of these two constants satisfy the known initial conditions for g: However these same initial conditions are resulting in and, finally, QED nepal ke sagarmaatha praant kaa jila jiske uttari chor par vishwa kaa sabase unchaa parvat mount everest sthit he

 Now the question arises that what is the mechanism of different processes of memory? In 1968, to explain the above processes of memory, Atkinson and Siffrin presented an explanation of the multi-layered collection of memory
 is paribhaasha ke anusaar smriti ke teen mukhya sangrah hote hai
 Our senses take the task of taking any information from the environment and passing it to the brain
 baad me us soochna ke aadhaar par mastishk dwaara ek nishkarsh nikaala jaataa he
 We can take the example of cold or heat sensation by seeing, hearing or skin
 koi bhi vaataavaraniya uddipan jaise prakaash yaa dhwani sabase pehle apane sambandhit gyanendriya me bahut hi kam samay ke liye kutabaddh rup main sangrahit hota he
 This storage is for a short time
 drushti ke liye isaki seemaa 0
5 second or shravan ke liye isaki samay seemaa 2 second ke aasapaas hoti he
 After this time limit, this stored memory is lost
 andrik str par suchanaaen abhi praarambhik hoti hai or inase koi nishkarsh nahin nikaal sakate
 Their brain has yet to be combined and scoured
 gyanendriyon dwaara praapt suchanaaen jab hamaare dhyaan main aati hai to ve alpakaaleen smriti kaa bhaag banati hai
 It is worth mentioning here that all the information at the sensory level which we do not pay attention to, ends
 keval vahiin suchanaaen jin par ham ekagra hote he ve alpakaaleen smritiyaan banati hai
 Short-term memory is also called functional memory
 is prakaar kii smriti kaa sarvshereshth udhaaharan hamaare dwaara koi phone number yaad karnaa he
 When we look at a number and dial it, there are two things
 sabase pehle ham nabar ko dekhte hai or use kuch ek baar doharaa ke yaad karte hai phir number dial karne ke baad saamanytah use bhul jate hai
 Hence two conclusions can be drawn regarding this type of memory
 pratham, alpakaaleen smriti kii kshamta bahut kam hoti he dwitiya, is prakaar kii smriti main agar ekaagratha main thodi bhi kami se hamaara dhyaan bant jaae to smriti shesh nahin rah jaati
 In the example of phone, if there is any other thing between remembering and dialing the number, then we will not remember the number
 vaigyanikon ne pataa lagaaya he ki is prakaar kii smriti main soochna kaa kul sangrahan 20 se 30 second tak hi hota he
 But if the information is repeated, this time can be more than 20 to 30 seconds
 or agar baar-baar dhyaan se doharaaen to yah soochna dirghakaalin smriti main parivartit ho jaati he
 As is clear from the name itself, long-term memories are permanent
 ham is smriti kaa upyog bahut tareeko se karte hai
 What did we eat for breakfast this morning? Who came to our house the day before yesterday? What clothes did those people wear? Where and how did we celebrate our last birthday? From how we ride a bicycle to solve a crossword puzzle, this memory supports us in all these activities
 is prakaar kii smriti sabase adhik vividh hoti he or hamaari bhaawanaaon, anubhavon tathaa gyaan ityadi in sabhi rupo main parilakshith hoti he
 Short-term memory information becomes a long-term memory after repeated repetitions
 is smriti kaa kshay nahin hota lekin isamen parivartan ho saktaa he
 Till now, the mechanism of memory was being talked about
 yah prashn abhi baaki he ki hamaara mastishk in soochnaaon ko kaise sangrahit karata he or tantrika tantra kii koun-koun si gatividhiyaan iske liye uttardaai hoti hai
