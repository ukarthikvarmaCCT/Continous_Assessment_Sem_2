 It is one of several species originally described as Felis leo in his work Sistema Naturi by Linnaeus in the eighteenth century
 The genealogical component of its scientific designation, Panthera leo, is often thought to be derived from the Greek words pan - ") and ther"), but may be a folk noun

 Traditionally, twelve subspecies of lions have recently been identified, of which the largest is Barbary lion
 in up prajatiyon ko vibhedit karne vaale mukhya antar he sthiti, ayaal kii upasthiti, aakaar or vitaran
 Because these traits are very insignificant and reflect high individual resolution, most of these forms are debatable and possibly invalid; In addition, they often rely on zooids of unknown origin with "salient but unusual" morphological features

 Lions are known to breed with tigers leading to the creation of hybrids known as ligers or tigons
 unhone tendue ke saath prajnan ke dwaara leopon, or jaguaar ke saath prajnan ke dwaara jegalyan bhi banaaye hai
 Maroji is a spotted lion or a natural leopon, while the Congolese spotted lion is a complex lion-jaguar-leopard hybrid called lizagulep
 aise sankar saamanytah kisi samay par chidyaghar main prajnan karwaae jate the, lekin ab jatiyon or up prajatiyon ke sangrakshan par jor die jane ke kaaran yah prakriya hatosahit ho gayi he
 Hybrids are still bred in zoos and private animal bird collections in China

 They acquire the physical and practical properties of both male and female parent species
 Male ligers are impotent, but female ligers are often reproducible

 a less common tigon is a hybrid between a lioness and a male tiger
 singh sabhi feline main se sabase lambaa he or saath hi baagh ke baad doosraa sabase baari phelline he
 With powerful legs, a strong jaw, and 8 cm long canine teeth, the lion can also drag and kill large prey

 However, due to the variation of skull in the two species, generally only the lower jaw structure can be used as a reliable indicator of species
 singh ke rangon main bhi bahut bhinnata milti he, yah baf se lekar, pilaa, laal, yaa gaharaa bhura ho saktaa he
 The lower parts are generally light colored and the tail bunch is black
 singh ke shaavak apane sharir par bhure dhabbon ke saath paidaa hote hai, yah tendue se miltaa julata lakshan he
 Although as lions begin to become adult, these spots fade, discolored spots can be seen, especially in the female, later on the lower parts and legs
 singh billi parivaar kaa ek maatr sadsy he jo spasht langik dvirupata pradarshit karata he- arthath, nar or maadaa vibhedit rup se alag dikhaai dete hai
 For example, the lioness, which plays the role of a hunter, lacks a thick cumbersome mane like a male

 This symptom hinders a male's ability to hide himself during hunting and generates a lot of heat while running
 nar ke ayaal kaa rang kesari se lekar kaala tak hota he, saamanyatya yah rang uski aayu ke badhane ke saath gaharaa hota jaataa he
 The body weight of an adult lion is generally 150–250 kg for a male and 120–182 kg for a female
 novel or jackson report ke anusaar nar kaa vajan 181 kilogram or maadaa kaa vajan 126 kilogram hota he; mount kenya ke paas ek nar kaa vajan 272 kilogram paaya gaya

 The captive lions are of a larger size than the wild lions — the heaviest lion ever recorded in the record is a Simba salt a male lion, weighing 375 kg, kept at the Colchester Zoo in England in 1970
 sabase vishisht visheshta jo nar or maadaa donon main pai jaati he vah yah he, ki donon main poonch ek baalo ke guchchhe main samaapt hoti he, is guchchhe main ek kathor "spine " yaa "spor" hota he jo lagbhag 5 millimetre lambaa hota he, jo aapas main sangalit ho gayi puchh asthi ke antim bhaag se banataa he
 The lion is the only felid in which a tufted tail is found — the functions of this spine and bunch are unknown
 janm ke samay anupasthit yah guchha lagbhag 51⁄2 maah kii aayu main viksit hota he or 7 maah kii aayu par aasaani se pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 The mane of an adult male lion is unique among cats, being the most distinguishing characteristic of this species
 yah singh ko bada dikhaata he, ek shandaar rup detaa he; yah anya singhon or prajati ke mukhya pratispardhi, africa ke spoted hyena, ke saath mukaable ke dauraan singh kii madad karata he, ayaal kii upasthiti, anupasthiti, rang or aakaar, anuvanshik saranchana, langik paripakvata, jalwaayu or testosterone ke nirmaan se sambandhit hota he; thamb rul ke anusaar ayaal jitani gahari or ghani hoti he, singh utana hi swasth hota he
 The lioness gives preference to the male whose mane is more dense and deep when choosing his sexual partner
 tanzania main anusandhan bhi bataata he ki nar-nar sambandh main ayaal kii lambaai ladai main safalataa ke signal detii he
 Deep-manicured animals have a high reproductive age and increase the chances of survival of their offspring, although they suffer a lot during the hottest months of the year
 do yaa teen naron se yukt ek samooh main aisi sambhaavna hoti he ki maadaa us nar ke saath sakriyata se sambhog karnaa chaahati he jisaki ayaal adhik ghani hoti he
 Scientists once said that the specific status of some subspecies can be understood by morphology, including mane size

 haalanki anusandhan bataate hai ki paryaavarniya kaarak jaise parivesh kaa taapmaana ayaal ke aakaar or rang ko prabhavit karte hai
 Zoos in European and North America are more densely manic due to cold ambient temperatures
 is prakaar se ayaal up prajati kii pahchaan kaa upyukt markar nahin he
 Although males of the Asian subspecies are reflected by the rare mane compared to the average African lion, the maneless male lion has been found in Senegal and Savo East National Parks in Kenya, and Timbawati's original white male lion was also maneless
 kastrated singh kii ayaal nunatam hoti he
 Sometimes there is an absence of a mane in the population of interbreed lions; This inbreeding also causes a decrease in fertility
 kai singhniyon main ek raf hoti he jo vishesh sthitiyon main spasht ho sakati he
 It is sometimes indicated in sculptures, paintings, especially ancient artwork and is mistaken for a man's mane
 yah ek ayaal se alag hoti he, haalanki yah jabade kii rekha par kaan ke neeche pai jaati he, iske bal kii lambaai kam hoti he or is par jaldi se dhyaan nahin jaataa he, jabaki ek ayaal nar ke kaanon ke upar tak faili hoti he, aksar unki bahari rekha ko puri tarah se dhak detii he
 The extinct European cave lion cave paintings depict animals without mane, or only a hint of mane, indicating that they were more or less mane; However, females hunting for a group have been the main subject of the paintings — since they are depicted in a hunting-related group — so these pictures are not sufficient to decide that males were mannered
 chitra bataate hai ki vilupt prajatiya samakaleen singhon kii tarah samaan saamaajik sanghathan or shikaar kii ranneetiyon kaa prayog karti thim
 The white lion is not a distinct subspecies, but a genetic condition, a distinctive form of leukism, that causes yellowishness in color that gives a white tiger-like color; This condition is similar to militarization, which is the cause of black panthers
 ve albinos nahin hote hai, unki aankhon or twachaa main saamaanya abhiranjan hota he, safed transwaal singh kabhi kabhi purvi dakshini africa main kruger rashtriya udyaan or paas hi ke timbavathi nijee khel rigerv main saamne aaye, lekin saamanyatya unhen kaid main rakhaa jaataa he, jahaan prajnak soch samaj kar unka chayan karte hai
 An unusual cream-colored covering on their body is caused by an ineffective gene

 Sighting was first reported in the early 1900s and continued to occur randomly for nearly 50 years, when in 1975 the waste of the white lion cub was found in the Timbavati Game Reserve
 singh apana adhikansh samay aaraam karte hue bitaate hai or ek din main lagbhag 20 ghanton ke liye niskriy rahete hai, yadhyapi singh kisi bhi samay sakriy ho sakate hai, aam taur par unki gatividhiyaan sanjh ke baad tivratam ho jaati hai jab ve ikatthe hote hai, samooh banaate hai or mel tyaag karte hai
 Sudden intermittent activities occur during the night until dawn when hunted frequently
 ve ausatan ek din main do ghante chalane main or 50 minute khaane main vyay karte hai
 Lion hunters are carnivores that express two types of social organization
 kuch nivasee hote hai jo pride naamak samooh main rahete hai
 The pride usually consists of about five or six related females, their cubs of both sexes and one or two males who form a relationship with an adult female
 Males associated with a pride typically have up to two, but can also increase to four and decrease again over time
 nar shaavak paripakv ho jane par apni maa ke pride ko chhod dete hai
 The second organizational behavior is called nomads, which are widely spread over a range and move around randomly, they may live alone or in pairs, pairs of related males are more commonly seen that differ from their original pride
 Have become
 dhyaan den ki ek singh apni jivan style ko badal saktaa he; khanaabadosh nivasee ban sakate hai or iskaa vipareet bhi sambhav he
 Males have to go through this lifestyle and some are never able to join any pride
 If a female becomes nomadic, it is more difficult for her to join a new pride, because females in a pride are related and reject most attempts by an unrelated female to join their group
 ek pride ke dwaara gheraa jane vaala kshetra pride kshetra kehalaata he, jabaki ek khanaabadosh kaa kshetra range kehalaata he
 Males belonging to a pride, preferring to live in frontier places, patrolling their territory
 singhniyon main samaajwaad - kisi bhi billi jati main sabase spasht- kyon viksit hua, yah ek vivaad kaa vishay he
 There seems to be an obvious reason for increased success in hunting, but it is not more definite on investigation: hunting together leads to success in the process, but at the same time it is certain that non-hunting members per member Calories reduce the amount of ingestion, although some play a role in picking up cubs, which can be left alone for this extended time period
 pride ke sadsy niyamit rup se shikaar main samaan bhoomika nibhaate rahete hai
 Hunters' health is the primary requirement for the survival of the pride and they are the first to consume it after being taken to the site
 anya laabhon main shaamil hai, sambhav parijan chayan, chhoton kii suraksha, kshetra kaa rakh rakhaav or vyaktigat rup se chot or bhukh ke viruddh sunishchitata
 The lioness does most of the hunting for its pride, as it is more small, agile and agile than the male, does not even have a heavy and distinct mane that overheats during fatigue
 They work in collaboration with the group to chase and successfully pull their prey
 yadhyapi, yadi shikaar paas main he to, ek baar jab sinhani safal ho jaati he or kha leti he, nar main mrit par haaavee ho jane kii pravriti hoti he
 They share more food with cubs than with lionesses, but rarely share food they have killed
 chote shikaar ko shikaar ke sthaan par hi kha liya jaataa he, ise shikari aapas main baant lete hai; jab shikaar bada ho to ise aksar ghaseet kar pride kshetra main laayaa jaataa he

 Furthermore, the synchronization of births has the advantage that the cubs remain approximately the same size in the end and thus their chances of survival are nearly equal
 yadi ek sinhani duusari sinhani ke do maah baad bacchon ko janm detii he, For example, younger cubs are much younger than their older brothers, and large cubs often dominate them at feeding time — resulting in starvation deaths among younger cubs

 This list is of cities in countries of Asia: - saanchaa:mahadweep anusaar sheharsaanchaa:asia ke vishay a computer virus or computer virus is a computer program that can duplicate itself and infect a computer without the user's permission, and the user is not even aware of it
 vibhinn prakaar ke mailaware or adware programs ke sandarbh main bhi "virus" shabd kaa upyog saamaanya rup se hota he, haalaanki yah kabhi-kabhi galati se bhi hota he
 The original virus can make changes in duplicates, or the duplicates themselves can make changes, as in a transformed virus
 ek virus ek computer se duusare computer main tabhi fail saktaa he jab iskaa host ek asankramit computer main laayaa jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye ek upyogkarta ke dwaara ise ek network yaa internet par bhejne se, yaa ise hathaaye jane yogya madhyam jaise flopy discs, CD, yaa USB drive par laane se
 isi ke saath virus ek aise sanchika tantra yaa jaal sanchika pramali par sankramit sanchikaon ke dwaara duusare computaron par fail saktaa he jo duusare computaron par bhi khul sakati hon
kabhi kabhi computer kaa keedaa or trogen horces ke liye bhi bhram purvak virus shabd kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 a worm can spread itself to other computers, it does not need to be transferred as a fortune to the host, and a Trojan horse is a file that appears to be harmless
 kide or trogen horse ek commuter system ke aankadon, kaaryaatmak pradarshan, yaa kaary nishpaadan ke dauraan netwarking ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 In general, a worm does not actually harm the system's hardware or software, whereas a Trojan payload, at least in theory, is capable of causing any type of damage during execution
 jab program nahin chal rahaa he tab kuch bhi nahin dikhaai detaa he lekin jaise hi sankramit code chalata he, trogen horse pravesh kar jaataa he
 This is why it is very difficult for people to find viruses and other malware and hence they have to use spyware programs and registration procedures
 aajkal adhikansh vyaktigat computer internet or lokar aria network se jude hai or local aria network, dooshit code ko failaane kii prakriya ko suvidhajanak banaata he
 Today's virus can also take advantage of network services such as the World Wide Web, e-mail, instant messaging and file sharing systems to help spread viruses and insects
 iske alaava, kuch strot ek vaikalpik shabdaawalee kaa upyog karte hai, jisamen ek virus swa-anulipi karne vaale mailaware kaa ek rup hota he
 Some malware is programmed to damage the computer by destroying destructive programs, deleting files, or re-formatting the hard disk
 anya mailaware program kisi kshati ke liye nahin banaaye jate hai, lekin saadhaaran rup se apane aap ko anulipit kar lete hai oe shaayad koi text, video, yaa audio sandesh ke dwaara apni upasthiti ko darshaate hai
 Even these less ominous malware programs can cause problems for the computer user
 
ve aamtaur par vaid kaaryakramon ke dwaara prayog kii jane vaali computer kii smriti ko apane niyantran main le lete hai
 As a result, they often cause erratic behavior and damage the system
 iske atirikt, bahut se mailaware bag se grast hote hai, or ye bag system ko nuksaan panhucha sakate hai yaa data kshati kaa kaaran ho sakate hai
 Many CID programs are programs that are downloaded by the user and pop up each time
 iske parinaam swarup computer kii gati bahut kam ho jaati he lekin ise dhundhana or samasya ko rokna bahut hi kathin hota he
 The earliest virus creeper was discovered on Arpanet, which first appeared on the Internet in the early 1970s
 yah TENEX oparating system ke dwaara failaa or yah computer ko niyantrit or sankramit karne ke liye kisi bhi jude modem kaa upyog kar saktaa tha
 It can display the message "I am the creeper; catch me if you can"
 It was rumored that the Reaper program, which appears shortly after and made copies of the creeper and deleted them, may have been written in a letter of regret by the creator of the creeper
 ek aam dharna he ki ek program jo "rothar j "kehalaata tha vah "in di wild " prakat hone vaala pehla computer virus tha —yah ek computer ke baahar yaa prayogshaala main banaaya gaya, lekin yah daawa galat tha
 See the timeline of well-known computer viruses and insects for other recent viruses
 But it was the first virus to infect computers "at home"
 1982 main richard scranta, ke dwaara likhaa gaya, isane khud ko appal DOS 3
3 oparating system ke saath jod liya or flopy discs ke dwaara failaa
multah yah virus ek hai skool ke chaatr ke dwaara nirmit ek majaak tha or ise ek khel ke rup main flopy discs par daal diya gaya
 On its 50th use, the Elk Cloner virus became active, infecting the computer, and it displayed a short poem "elk Cloner: The program with a personality"
 In The Wild the first PC virus was a boot sector virus that Called Brain Brain), it was created by Farooq Alvi Brothers in 1986, and operated outside Lahore, Pakistan
 inhone is kathith virus ko unke dwaara banaaye gaye software kii pratiyon ki chori rokane ke liye banaaya
yadhyapi, vishleshkon ne daawa kiya ki Ashar virus jo, brain kii ek prajati he, sambhawatah virus ke andar code ke aadhaar par ise purv dinaankit karata he
 Before computer networks became widespread, most viruses spread to removable mediums, especially floppy disks
 shuruaati dinon main nijee computer, ke kai upyogkartaaon ke bich niyamit rup se jaankaree or prograamon kaa vinimay fluopiyon ke dwaara hota tha
 Many viruses spread from infected programs on these disks, while some installed themselves in the boot area of the disk, ensuring that when the user boots the computer from the disk, it will run unintentionally
 KPC first tried to boot from the floppy if any floppy remained in the drive
 jab tak flopi kaa upyog kam nahin ho gaya tab tak yah sarvaadhik safal sankraman ranneeti thi, in the wild boot kshetra ke virason ko bananaa sabase aasaan tha
 Traditional computer viruses emerged in the 1980s, due to increased use of personal computers and as a result increased use of BBS and modems, and software exchanges
 bulatin board software ke aadan pradaan ne pratyaksh rup se trogen horse programs ko failaayaa or virus lokapriy vyavsaayik software ko sankramit karne ke liye banaaye jate the
 Shareware and bootlegs were common carriers for BBS viruses
 hobists ke "piret seen" main jo khudara software, kii avaidh pratiyon kaa vyaek virus ek sankramit mashin par sabhi samparkon ko twarit sandesh ke rup main ek web pataa link bhej saktaa he
 If the recipient thinks that the link is from a friend, they follow the link on the website, the virus present on the site may be able to infect this new computer and start spreading
 virus parivaar kii sabase nai prajati he kros sait patakatha virus
yah virus anusandhan se ubhara or 2005 main iskaa academik rup se pradarshan hua
 The virus is transmitted using cross-site scripting
 2005 ke baad se in the wild, kros sait patakatha virason ke bahut se udahaaran rahe hai, sabase ullekhneey prabhavit saiten hai mispes or yahuu
 To replicate itself, a virus must have permission to execute code and write to memory
 For this reason, many viruses attach themselves to executable files that may be part of the appropriate program
 yadi ek upyog karta ek sankramit program ko shuru karne kii koshish karata he to, aisa ho saktaa he kii pehle virus kaa code nishpadit ho
 viruson ko do prakaar main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he, unke vyavhaar ke aadhaar par or unke nishpaadan ke aadhaar par
anivaasee virus tunrat anya poshiyon ko khojate hai jinhen sankramit kiya ja saktaa he, in lakshyon ko sankramit karte hai or antat niyantran ko anuprayog program par sthanantarit kar dete hai jise unhone sankramit kiya he
 Resident viruses do not look for Poshi when they begin
 iske bajaay, ek nivasee virus apane aap ko nishpaadan par smriti main lod kar letaa he or niyantran ko poshi program par sthanantarit kar detaa he
 The virus remains active in the background and infects new hosts when these files are accessed by other programs or by the operating system itself
 aisa mana jaataa he ki anivaasee virus ek khojak modul or ek pratikruti modul se yukt hota he
 The Finder module is responsible for finding new files for transition
 har nai nishpaadan yogya fil ke liye khojak modul akraman kar detaa he, yah fil ko sankramit karne ke liye anulipi modul ko bulaata he
 a resident virus has a duplication module similar to the duplication module employed by a non-resident virus
 yadhyapi yah modul khojak modul ke dwaara nahin bulaayaa jaataa he
 Instead, the virus loads the duplication module into memory when it is executed and ensures that this module executes each time the operating system performs a certain operation
 udhaaharan ke liye, har baar jab oparating system ek sanchika ko nishpadit karata he, anulipi modul ko bulaayaa ja saktaa he
 In this case, the virus infects every appropriate program to be executed on the computer
 kabhi kabhi nivasee virus ko aage do shreniyon main upavibhajit kiya jaataa he ek teevr sankramak or duusare dhimen sankramak
teevr sankramak ko is prakaar se banaaya gaya he ki jitani adhik sanchikaon ko ho sake sankramit kar sake
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek teevr sankramak akses ho sakane vaali har sambhav poshi sanchika ko sankramit karata he
 This is a particular problem for anti-virus softwares, as a virus scanner will access every possible host file when it performs a comprehensive system scan
 yadi virus scanner is baat kaa dhyaan nahin rakh paata ki aisa ek virus smriti main upasthit he, virus scanner par peeche se waar karata he or is prakaar se scan ho rahi sabhi sanchikaon ko sankramit kar detaa he
 Acute infectives rely on rapid infection rates for their spread
 is vidhi kaa nuksaan yah he ki kai sanchikaon ko sankramit karne se pataa lagane kii sambhaavna adhik ho jaati he, kyon ki virus computer ko dhimaa kar detaa he yaa kai sandigdh kriyaaon ko karata he jo virus virdohi software ke dwaara dekhi ja sakati hai
 The second and slower infectives are made in such a way that they infect the host un-covered
 udhaaharan ke liye, kuch dhime sankramak sanchikaon ko keval tabhi sankramit karte hai jab unako copy kiya ja rahaa he
 They are not easy to detect due to the limited function of slow infectives: they do not slow down the computer too much, but frequently shock anti-virus softwares that can be detected by the suspicious behavior of the programs
 dhime sankramak bahut adhik safal prathit nahin hote hai, Viruses have targeted different types of transmission media
 yah suchi khatm nahin ho sakati he: pdfs, such as HTML, may be associated with malicious code
 kuch virus lekhakon ne jo likhaa he uskaa koi mahatva nahin he
 PNG at the end of the EXE extension, hoping that the user would stop at the type of the trusted file, would not notice that the computer would start with the final file type
 Trojan Horse) view upyogkarta ke dwaara pataa lagane se bachane ke liye, kuch wiras vibhinn prakaar ke chal karte hai
 Some older viruses, especially on the MS-DOS platform, ensure that when the file is infected by the virus, the date that the host file is "last modified" remains
 yadhyapi yah drushtikon virus virdohi software ko murkh nahin banataa he, vishesh rup se wo jo sanchika parivartan par chakree atirek kii jaanch ki dinaankon ko banaaye rakhata he
 Some viruses can infect files without increasing their size and damaging the files
 ve aisa nishpaadan yogya sanchikaon ke aprayukt kshetron main adhilekhan ke dwaara karte hai
 This is called cavity virus
 udhaaharan ke liye kii CIH virus, yaa cheranobil virus, portable nishpaadan yogya sanchikaon ko sankramit karata he
 Because there were many free spaces in those files, the virus, which was 1 KB in length, did not get attached to the file size
 Some viruses do not allow themselves to be exposed to the anti-virus software before it is detected
 Because computers and operating systems are becoming more developed and complex, there is a need to upgrade or replace old concealing technologies
 ek computer ko virus se surakshit rakhane ki maang yah ho sakati he ki sanchika tantra har prakaar ke sanchika acces ke liye vistrut or spasht anumati kii or palaayan kar jaae
 a virus needs to be infected to spread further for a virus
 kuch maamalon main, ek poshi ko sankramit karnaa ek kharaab vichaar ho saktaa he udhaaharan ke liye, kai virus virdohi program apane code kii akhandta kii jaanch karte hai
 Therefore infection of such programs will increase the possibility that the virus has been detected
 is kaaran se, kuch virus un prograamon ko sankramit nahin karte hai jo virus virdohi software kaa hissaa he
 Another type of virus that the virus sometimes tries to avoid is bait files
 Bat files are files created specifically by anti-virus software or anti-virus professionals themselves to be infected by a virus
 
 in sanchikaon ko bhinn kaarnon se banaaya ja saktaa he, ye sabhi virus kaa pataa lagane se sambandhit hai
 Since bat files are used to detect viruses or make probes possible, the infection cannot be taken advantage of by the virus
 aam taur par virus aam taur par aisa virus prograamon se batch kar aisa karte hai, jaise choti program sanchikaaye yaa program jinamein ' kooda nirdesh ' ke vishisht praturup hon
batting ko mushkil banane ke liye ek sambandhit ranneeti he viral sankraman
kabhi kabhi, viral sankramak ek poshi sanchika ko sankramit nahin karte hai jo anya sthitiyon main sankraman ke liye upyukt ummidavaar ho saktaa he
 For example, a virus may decide on a random basis whether to infect a file or not, or a virus can infect host files on particular days of the week
 kuch virus oparating system se anurodh karke virus virdohi software ko dhokhaa dene ki koshish karte hai
 The anti-virus software requests to read the file and the request goes to the virus instead of the OS, thus a virus hides itself
 ab virus virdohi software kii sanchika ke asankramit sanskaran par lot jaataa he, jisase ki aisa prathit hota he ki sanchika " svachh " he
 Modern anti-virus software has several techniques for detecting the theft of viruses
 chori ko rokane kii keval ek vishwasaneey vidhi he ek aise madhyam se boot karnaa jo svachh ho
 Most anti-virus programs try to find virus patterns within simple programs, this is called the signature of the so-called virus
 hastakshar ek lakshanik bit praturup he, jo ek vishesh virus yaa virus parivaar kaa ek bhaag he
 If a virus scanner discovers such a pattern in a file, it notifies the user that the file is infected
 upyogkarta phir is sanchika ko nasht kar sakate hai, yaa sankramit sanchika ko " shuddh " yaa " thik "kar sakate hai
 Some viruses use techniques that not only make it difficult to detect by signature, but also impossible
 ye virus prayek sankraman par apana code badal lete hai
 That is, each infected file contains a different species of virus
 virus ke kutalekhan ke liye ek or adhik unnat vidhi he saral ancripshan kaa upyog
is maamle main, virus ek chote se decrypting modul or virus ke code ki ek ancrypted copy se yukt hota he
 If the virus is encrypted with a different key for each infected file, then only part of the virus remains static is the decrypting module, which will be attached to the end of it
 In this case, a virus scanner will use the signature directly of the virus
 Cannot detect, but it can still detect decrypting modules, which can still indirectly detect possible viruses
 chunki ye sankramit poshi par sangrahit kunjia hongi, vastav main antim virus ko vicode karnaa puri tarah se sambhav he, lekin isaki shaayad zarurat nahin he, chunki swayan sanshodhit code itnaa durlabh he ki iske kaaran se virus scanner kam se kam sandigdh sanchika ko ankit kar saktaa he
 An older but compact, encryption involves a static virus that xoring each byte, so that the operation is repeated only for decryption
 This is ambiguous code that modifies itself, so many virus definitions include an encryption / decryption signature
 Could be part
 bahurupi code pehali takanic thi jo virus scanner ke liye ek gambhir khatra bani
 niyamit ancrypted virus kii tarah, ek bahurupi virus apane ancrypted code ke saath sanchikaon ko sankramit karata he, jo ek dicripshan modul ke dwaara dicode kar diya jaataa he
 In the case of polymorphic viruses, this decryption module is also modified on each infection
 isliye thik prakaar se likhe gaye bahurupi virus main aise koi bhaag nahin hai jo sankramanon main samaan hon, yah hastakshar kaa upyog karke iskaa pataa lagaana mushkil banaata he
 Anti-virus software can detect it by decrypting using a competitor, or by statistical replication analysis of the encrypted virus body
 bahurupi code ko sakasham karne ke liye, virus ke paas iske ancrypted sharir main kahin par ek bahurupi ingine hona chahie 
is tarah ke ingine kaise kaam karte he is par takneekee vistaar ke liye bahurupi code dekhen
kuch virus bahurupi code ko is prakaar se kaam main lete hai ki yah mukhya rup se virus ke utparivartan kii dar ko baadhya karata he
 For example, a virus is programmed to mutate only in a short period of time, or it can be programmed to infect a file that already contains duplicate viruses, So it can avoid mutation
 The advantage of using slower polymorphic code is that it makes it difficult for the anti-virus professional to obtain a representative sample of the virus, because BAT files that are infected once they run are typically identical to the virus
 Will be the sample
 This will increase the likelihood that the probe performed by the virus scanner will be unreliable and it may be that some instances of the virus may not be able to detect the probe
 anukaran ke dwaara jaanch se bachane ke liye kuch virus har baar jab ek nae nishpadanyogy ko sankramit karte hai tab apane aap ko punarlikhit kar lete hai
 Viruses that use such technology are called metamorphic ones

 udhaaharan ke liye, W32 / Simile main samooh bhashaa code kii 14000 se adhik rekhyen hoti hai, jinamein se 90% roopantarit ingine kaa hissaa he
 Just as genetic diversity in a population decreases, it reduces the chance of a single disease, similarly the diversity of software systems on a network also limits the destructive potential of the virus
 yah 1990 main vishesh vichaar kaa vishay ban gaya jab microsoft ne desktop oparating system or karyaalay suite main bazaar main prabhutv praapt kar liya
 Users of Microsoft software and Internet Explorer) are particularly vulnerable to the spread of viruses

 Windows and Unix have the same scripting capabilities, but while Unix naturally prevents normal users from having access to make changes for the operating system environment, older copies of Windows such as Windows 95 and 98 do not
 In 1997, When a virus called "bliss" was released for Linux - major anti-virus vendors issued a warning to fix Unix-like systems
 Are solid, can become susceptible to viruses like
 bliss virus ko virason kaa lakshanik mana ja saktaa he--unics pranaaliyon par --keedon ke vipareet
bliss kii zarurat he ki upyogkarta ise spasht rup se chalaata he or yah keval aise prograamon ko sankramit kar saktaa he jo upyogkarta ke dwaara sanshodhit kiye ja sakate hai
 Unlike Windows users, most Unix users do not log in as an administrator user except by installing software: even if a user runs a virus it cannot harm the operating system
 bliss virus kabhi bhi vyapak nahin hua or mukhya rup se anusandhan ke liye utsukata kaa vishay bana rahaa

 Since software is often designed with a security mechanism to prevent unauthorized use of the system source, many viruses help spread software bugs in a system or application
 software vikaas ranneetiyaan jo badi sankhya main bag kaa utpaadan karti hai, saamaanya rup se sakasham dohan bhi utpann karti he
 Many users install anti-virus software, which detects or destroys known viruses after a computer download or after the executable has run
 aise do saamaanya tareeke hai jinhen ek virus virdohi software anuprayog virus kii jaanch karne ke liye kaam main letaa he
 The first and most common method of virus detection is to use a list of signature definitions of viruses
 It works by comparing the components of the computer's memory and the boot sector) and files stored on permanent or temporary drives and comparing these files The "signature" of known viruses is against the database
 jaanch kii is vidhi kaa nuksaan yah he ki upyog karta keval virus se surakshit rahata he jo apni pichhali paribhaasha kaa adhyatan karata rahata he
 The second method is the approximate algorithm in which viruses are based on normal behavior
 is vidhi main virason kaa pataa lagane ki kshamta hoti he jiske liye abhi bhi virus virdohi companiyon ko hastakshar bananaa he
 Some anti-virus programs are able to scan open files as well as e-mails sent and received 'on the fly' in a similar way
 ise "on-access scanning"kehete hai
 Anti-virus software does not change the ability of POSHI software to transmit viruses
 upyogkarta ko ptch suraksha chhidr ke liye apane software niyamit rup se adhyatan karne chahie
anti virus software ko bhi niyamit rup se adhyatan kiye jane kii aavashyaktaa he taaki aadhunik khataron ko roka ja sake
koi bhi vyakti bhinn media par data ke niyamit rup se byaap se virus ke dwaara kii gai kshati ko kam kar saktaa he, inhen yaa to system se asambaddha, rakhaa jaataa he, yaa anya kaarnon jaise bhinn sanchika pranaaliyon kaa upyog ke liye ise nahin kholaa ja saktaa yaa keval read-only rakhaa jaataa he
 In this way, if data is lost through a virus, anyone can resume using backup
 yadi optical media jaise sidi or dividi par ek byaap satr band ho gaya he, yah read-only ban jaataa he or ab virus se sankramit nahin ho saktaa he
 Likewise, an operating system on a bootable can be used to start a computer if the installed operating system usage is down
 anya vidhi he bhinn sanchika tantron par bhinn aaparating system kaa upyog
ek virus kii donon ko prabhavit karne kii sambhaavna nahin hoti he
 Data backup can also be performed on different file systems
 udhaaharan ke liye, linaks ko NTFS vibhaajan par likhane ke liye vishesh software kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, isliye yadi koi software ko install nahin karata he or ek NTFS vibhaajan par ek byaap karne ke liye MS vindos ke alag installation kaa upyog karata he, byaap ko lines ke kisi bhi varjan se surakshit hona chahie
isi tarah, MS vindos sanchika system jaise ext3, ko nahin pard saktaa he, isliye yadi koi saamanyatya MS vindos kaa upyog karata he, ek linaks installation kaa upyog karte hue ek ext3 vibhaajan par byaap banaaya ja saktaa he
 Once a computer is compromised by a virus, it is generally unsafe to continue to use the same computer without fully installing the operating system again
 lekin, kai vikalp hai jo computer main virus ke aane ke baad upasthit hote hai
 These actions depend on the severity of the type of virus
 Windows Me, Windows XP and Windows Vista par ek sambhaavna he ek aujaar jo system ristor ke naam se janaa jaataa he jo ki pichley check bindu ke liye registry or jatil tantra sanchika ko ristor kar ke rakhata he
 Often a virus hangs on to a system and after booting again, the system's restore point will have a problem from the same day
 The work has been done to restore point since the last days, now the virus will store stored files Can not infect
 phir bhi kuch virus, system ke ristor ko or anya mahatvapurn aujaaron jaise task menager or cmand prompt ko niskriy kar dete hai
 An example of a virus that does this is ciadoor
 Administrators have options to disable such tools from limited users for different reasons
 virus aisa karne ke liye registry main sanshodhan karata he, keval us samay aisa nahin hota he jab prashaasak computer ko niyantrit kar rahaa ho, yah sab upyogkartaaon ko aujaaron ko acces karne se roktaa he
 When an infected tool is activated it gives a message "task manager has been disabled by your administrator
 "yahan tak kii yadi upyogkarta jo program kholane kii koshish kar rahaa he vah prashaasak he
 Users who are running the Microsoft operating system can visit Microsoft's website to run a free scan if they have their 20-digit registration number
 oparating system ko punah install karnaa virus hataane kaa ek alag tarika he
 This usually involves re-formatting the OS partition and installing the OS through its original means
 yaa ek saafe bedap chhavi ke saath vibhaajan kii kalpana kii ja sakati he yaa Acronis ke saath liya gaya) 
is vidhi kaa laabh yah he kii yah karne main saral he, kai virus virdohi scan ko chalaane kii tulana main yah tej hota he or kisi bhi mailaware ko dur karne kii guarantee detaa he
 Downsides include reinstalling all other software and operating systems
 upyogkarta data ko ek live sidi ko boot karke yaa hard drive ko kisi duusare computer main rakhkar or us computer ke oparating system se boot karke bek ap kiya ja saktaa he
 Wbfz yah varsh kii aakhri grand slam tennis pratiyogita he jo america main neuyork shahar yojit kii jaati he
 The tournament was first played in the United States in 1881 in Newport in the month of August
 iskaa aayojan 1918 tak newport main hi hua
 The Challenge Round was removed in 1911
 amareeki federation se jude club ke sadsy hi is spardhaa main bhaag le sakate the
 The women's singles were first played in Philadelphia in 1887
 1919 main is pratiyogita kaa sthaan badalakar forest hill west said tennis club,neuyork kar diya gaya
 Until 1974, the competition was held on grass, between 1975 and 1977 the competition took place on clay courts
 1970 main yah pratiyogita open ho gai
 This competition was the first major competition to adopt a tie-break
 The US Open moved for the final time in 1978, with the Flushing Meadows stadium, in the Queens district of New York, having the honour of hosting the fourth and final Grand Slam event of the year since then
 The clay courts have been replaced by Decoturf hard court surfaces
 The US Open has the largest center court in the world, with room for 23,000 spectators in the Arthur Ashe Stadium, opened in 1997
 In 1999, the old center court was renovated and renamed the Louis Armstrong Stadium
 prithvi ke sataha ke kisi bhaag ke sthanon, nagaron, deshon, parvat, nadi aadi kii sthiti ko paimaane kii sahaayta se kaagaj par laghu rup main bananaa maanchitran kehalaata hai
 a map is made up of two words, value and picture, which means a picture or value is represented by a picture
 jis prakaar ek sookshmdarshi kisi choti vastu ko bada karke dikhaata he, uske vipareet maanchitr kisi bade bhubhag ko chote rup main prastut karte hai jisase ek najar main bhugolic jaankaree or unke antarsambandhon kii jaankaree mil sake
 a map is also called a map
 aajkal maanchitr keval dharti, yaa dharti kii sataha, yaa kisi vaastavik vastu tak hi simit nahin hai
 For example, a surface map of the moon or Mars can be made; An idea or concept can be mapped; Brain mapping is being done
 maanchitr kisi chauras sataha par nishchit maan yaa paimaane or akshansh evam deshaantar rekhaon ke jaal ke prakshep ke anusaar prithvi yaa anya grah, upgrah, athwa uske kisi bhaag kii seemayen tathaa tannihit vishisht vyaavhaarik, yaa sankethik, chihnon dwaara chithran yaa parilekhan maanchitr kehalaata he
 So, often a map is a small representative drawing of a large area, in which each point marked is the corresponding point on the map area
 is prakaar maanchitr tathaa maanchitrit kshetra main sthitik yaa sthanik samyaktaa sthapit ho jaati he
 Every picture, sign or figure used to display a geography or object on the map gives a sense of a specific position and due to its prevalence and usage, these stereotypes have become a universally accepted international legislation
 is prakaar ke chihnon ke upyog se kisi bhi bhashaa ke ankit maanchitr, bina us bhashaa ke gyaan ke bhi grahya evam pathneey ho jate hai
 Lines, words, signs, etc
 are used by various methods for the purpose of special purpose, which increases the accessibility and usefulness of the map
 maanchitr nirmaan ke kala main pichley kuch dashakon main, visheshkar dwitiya mahayuddh kaal tathaa parvarti kaal main prachur pragati hui he or samprati kam se kam shabdaalekh ke saath maanchitr main vibhinn prakaar ke tathyon kaa samyak parilekhan sambhav ho gaya he
 How many facts can be properly included in a map, it depends on the scale, projection and legal ability of the cartographer and artistic sense etc
 maanchitr vastut: trivim bhootal kaa dwivim chitra prastut karata he
 The map displays the form of an area as it appears from above
 at: prayek maanchitr main dwivim sthititathya, arthath vastu kii lambaai, chaudaai chitrit hoti he, na ki oonchaai yaa gaharaai
 For example, usually the mountains, houses or trees on the ground are not able to see the height of the plants on the map, nor the depth of the oceans etc
, but the block diagram and the relief model etc
 to display the stereoscopic pattern of the present land shape is excessive
 Are being built with success
 hindi kaa shabd 'maanchitr' 'maan' tathaa 'chitra' do shabdon kaa samasik rup he, jisase maan yaa maap ke anusaar chitra chitrit karne kaa spasht bodh hota he
 In this way, it is more scientific and meaningful than the map word in English which itself is made from the word Mappa in Latin language
 maanchitr ke saath hi chart evam plan shabdon kaa upyog hota he
 The word chart is derived from the French word cart, which used to refer to the terms chart and map, but now 'chart' is used to mark oceanic or atmospheric routes or water or air waves and their paths
 Holds for samudr par jahaajon ke tathaa vayumandal main vayuyanon main maarg chart par pradarshit kiye jate hen
 There is a practical difference between the map and the plan
 plan, saadharantaya uddeshy vishesh ke liye apekshaakrit chote bhaag ko thik thik maapkar taiyaar kiye gaye chitra ko kehete hai
 For example, a building plan is prepared by a building-building-art expert, in which not only its outer boundary, but also the special features of the rooms, doors, windows, etc
 are mentioned
 plan, maanchitr kii apeksha adhik bade paimaane par taiyaar kiye jate hai
 Maps are of many types and are useful in many ways
 prati ikai sthaan kaa maanchitr kisi anya prakaar ke varna yaa aalekhan kii apeksha adhik tathyasoochak evam samaveshi hota he
 Even in thousands of words, the fact that cannot be accurately described and given knowledge, can be given a scientific map with the help of a small facility
 isaliye aajkal sabhi prakaar ke gyaan vigyaan aadi sambandhi vastusthiti ke bodh ke liye maanchitron tathaa samantabodhi akritiyon, chitron aadi kaa adhikadhik upyog ho rahaa he
 There is a close relationship between geography and maps
 bhugol kaa adhyayan or adhyaapan donon maanchitr ke bina adhure tathaa asambhav se lagate hai
 Proper and intuitive knowledge of the position, extent or distribution of various facts and mutual static relations is obtained through the map
 udhaahranswaroop, yadi hamen deshavishesh yaa uske vibhinn prashasnic vibhaagon kii kul jansankhya kaa gyaan ho, to bhi us gyaan se hamen jansankhya ke vaastavik vitaran kaa bodh nahin ho paata, kintu usee gyaan ko maanchitr par ankit karne par na keval vitaran kaa pratyut kshetreey yaa sthaneey jansankulata ke vibhinn pariman bhi spasht gyaan sahaj hi ho jaataa he
 Therefore, through the map, as much knowledge of the earth's conditions can be obtained by the bird's eyesight, it is not possible by book or any other means
 bhugol main vastusthiti ke vitaran kaa vishesh adhyayan hota he, isaliye maanchitr ko adhikadhik mahatv pradaan kiya jaataa he
 In military science, the map is given due importance
 prashasnic kaaryon tathaa yojanaon main bhi maanchitr atyupayogi siddh hue hai
 Not only for the demarcation of nations or states or various administrative departments and subdivisions, a map of the distribution of the various natural and human resources of each section is also necessary for smooth administration
 yojana sambandhi kaaryon ke liye vibhinn maanviya tathaa prakritik sansadhano ke vitaran kaa gyaan bhi aavashyak he, jiske aadhaar par santulit tathaa vaigyanik rup se or pradeshik yaa kshetreey drushti se aarthik samunnati ke liye yojanaayen banaai jaaen
 In addition, the map is the best tool for understanding the ecological relationships and dependence of various natural components
 udhaahranswaroop, jalwaayu ke vibhinn avyavon, taap, ardrata, vrishti, aadi kaa sambandh mitti, vanaspatik tathaa jaivik prakaaron se maanchitr dwaara prakat kiya ja saktaa he or us sankalit chitra kaa sambandh jansankhya ke vitaran se sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 Military operations, tourism, traffic, trade, occupation, etc
, are of high importance in all fields
 20veen sadi ke uttarardh main jab manushya mahasaagaron ke tal tathaa antariksh ke grah upgrahon tak apni satta sthapit karne main safaltaapurvak sachesht hai, na keval prithvi ke hi pratyut anya grah upgrahon ke maanchitr taiyaar karne kii aavashyaktaa bad gai he
 The maps do not display any real facts on the ground floor, only by marking the position of the Earth's corresponding point on paper or other plane
 is satya kaa gyaan na hone se bhranti utpann hoti he
 The maps are flat, but the Earth or other planetary satellite, or any part thereof, is a sphere, that is, part of a sphere, but the sphere cannot be revealed exactly on the plane, so in this attempt the shape of the different parts of the map Deformation occurs
 prakshep ke dwaara vibhinn prakaar se akshansh evam deshaantar rekhaon kaa jaal taiyaar kar maanchitr banaaya jaataa he 
 Therefore, for the reading of the map, it is necessary to have knowledge of the relative position, direction, distance and extent etc
 of different parts of the earth
 maanchitr ke sambandh main do baaten aavashyak hai : Reading of the map, that is, gaining knowledge of the facts on the map about the Earth, and maanchitr kii rachana, jiske antargat, maanchitr taiyaar karne kii vidhiyon ko siikhnaa tathaa aankadon, maapak, prakshep, vyaavhaarik evam sankethik chihnon, rangon aadi kaa gyaan praapt karnaa aata he
 There are many types of maps and we can classify them in many ways: 1
 saadhaaran maanchitr 2
 Typical toxicological map
 saadhaaran maanchitr main maanchitr kshetra kii sabhi saadhaaran prakritik evam saanskrithik sthitiyon kaa samavesh rahata he, jaise parvat, nadi, prashasnic vibhaag, nagar, parivahan ke saadhan aadi
 Specific toxicological maps contain objective-specific facts such as population distribution maps or crops distribution maps
 ek hi maanchitr par bahut se yaa samast tathyon kaa pradarshan ek to asambhav he, duusare usase vibhinn tathyon ke vitaran, vistaar yaa saapekshik mahatv aadi ke vishay main bhrantiyaan ho jaati he, at: vibhinn tathyon kii kshetreey saapekshikta ke gyaan ke liye ek hi paimaane par taiyaar kiye gaye vibhinn vishyatmak maanchitron kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan aasaani se kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, distribution maps of rainfall, temperature, soil, vegetation, crops, and population at the same scale of an area, prepared separately, can be easily studied in comparative terms
 maanchitron ko paimaane tathaa uddeshy ke samavisht tathyon kii drushti se is prakaar vargeekrut kar sakate he: A
 Bhukar or Patwari Map - Such a map contains the detailed inclusion of land ownership, agricultural areas, buildings and other property
 prashasan dwaara vyaktigat bhoomi kar, aay kar, bhawan kar aadi, vasuul karne main isse suvidha milti he
 The maps of our villages are usually 16 inches, but sometimes 32 inches and 64 inches remain on a per mile scale
 kha
 bhu-akruti maanchitr - ye maanchitr shuddh surveykshan vidhiyon dwaara thik thik surveykshan karke taiyaar kiye jate hai
 Such are the maps of the Survey Department of India
 inamen dharaatal par ke mahatvapurn prakritik tathy, jaise parvat, pathaar, ucchavachan, nadi, vanaspati aadi tathaa saanskrithik, arthath maanav dwaara nirmit vastuen, jaise bhawan, gram, nagar, parivahan ke saadhan, aadi pradarshit kiye jate hai
 Usually they are measured as one inch equal to one mile, but there are also maps of 1 / 2 inch or 1 / 4 inch equal to one mile
 videshi maanchitron ke paimaane bhi bhinn bhinn hote hai
 Most European countries have different 1: 25,000 or 1: 1,00,000 or multiples of the geographic maps
 sanyukt rajya main 1:62,500 yaa 1:1,25,000, ke dyotak bhinn par bhu-akruti maanchitr bane hai
 With the adoption of the metric system, survey maps of India are also being changed on a scale varying from 1: 50,000
 1:10,00,000 ke maanchitr bhi isi prakaar ke hai, jinhen antarrashtriya maanchitr kehete hai
 C
 Diwari Maps - Their scale is smaller than geomorphic maps
 isamen bhi pramukh prakritik tathaa manavnirmit nirmaanon kaa aalekh rahata he or isaliye inkaa adhikansh upyog kakshaon main adhyayan adhyaapan ke liye hota he
 D
 Atlas Mapography - These maps are drawn on a relatively small scale and, like the Diwali maps, include various natural and man-made constructions
 chota paimaana hone ke kaaran praaia: pramukh prashaanik khandon evam vibhaagon ne bhi rashtriya yaa pradeshik atlas taiyaar kiye hai or kar rahe hai
 In India also, the Central Government has prepared an important national atlas scheme, which is centered at Calcutta and which is running successfully in the management of geographers
 uddeshy evam tathy ke anusaar bhi maanchitron ke anek prakaar hote hai
 Such maps are named according to the particular features which are included in them; For example, a map showing the position of planetary satellites and space is called an 'astrological map', but when a number of facts are displayed and there is a subjective association, the original subject is named; For example, when heat, wind, water or snow or meteorological elements coexist in a map, it is called a weather map
 kuch pramukh tathyaatmak maanchitr nimna hai : 1
 Astrology Map; 2
 ucchavachan maanchitr; 3
 Geological map: It includes geological conditions, rocks, minerals and soil etc
 and their expansion etc
; 4
 samudr kii gaharaai maapan maanchitr : inamen samudron, mahasaagaron yaa badi jhilonsh aadi kii samudr tal se gaharaai tathaa unke vital kii unchaai nichaai pradarshit kii jaati he; 5

 Soldier Map - These contain facts of military importance
 maanchitr main shabdon dwaara kam se kam vastusthiti yaa tathy kaa aalekh hota he or unke sthaan par vividh vidhiyon kaa upyog hota he
 Those various methods and symbols can be collectively labeled as the language of the map
 is bhashaa ke nimnlikhit pramukh tatv hai: In the map, the earth or its segment is displayed in a small form
 at: prithvi tathaa maanchitr ke madhya jo anupatik sambandh hota he, use paimaane dwaara pradarshit karte hai
 There are two types of scale: long and short
 deergh paimaane main do binduon ke madhya kii duuri apekshaakrit adhik hogi
 Therefore, a long scale map will cover less area than a small scale map, but it will clearly include more facts
 chote paimaane main do binduon kii duuri samipatar hogi or apekshaakrit kam yaa pramukh tathyon kaa hi samakan aise maanchitron main sambhav he
 The choice of scale depends on the following: the total area of the mapped area, the extent of the paper, the number of facts to be marked, and the purpose of the map
 paimaana prayek maanchitr par avashya ankit rahanaa chahie
 Scales are displayed with three methods, but not all methods are shown on each map: a
 By or by simple description, such as 4 inches = 1 mile; B
 By line, c
 By the ratio denominator or representative fraction, dyotak bhinn paimaane kaa sabase bada laabh yah he ki isse agyaat bhashaa ke maanchitr par ankit do binduon kii duuri or prithvi ke anupatik sambandh ko gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 The scale of simple description can be changed to divergent fraction and the divergent fraction to the scale of simple description
 maanchitr par adhikadhik evam vividh prakaar ke chihnon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jinka ham do bhaagon main varnan kar sakate hai
 Symbolic or symbolic symbols are those which are often used by different individuals to represent different facts
 ye chihn rekha, bindu, vrutt, varg, tribhuj aadi, vibhinn jyamitiya akritiyon athwa pratikatmak aksharo dwaara dikhalaae jate hai Stereotypes are also indicative, but at the international level, they are traditionally recognized and use the special mark for facts
 udhaahranswaroop, pakki sadak ko har desh ke dharatleey maanchitr par do samaantar rekhaon dwaara tathaa kachi sadak ko do samaantar tuuti rekhaon dwaara dikhalaate hai
 This increases the accessibility and usefulness of maps at the international level

 a network of latitude and longitude lines drawn from east to west and north to south pure, exactly the right distance, is necessary to determine the position of a place on the maps
 yadi kisi sthaan vishesh kii sthiti 50° 25' 252 uthho acco tathaa70° 25' 152 puchho desho par he, to bhugolic jaal kii sahaayta sugamawa se isaki sthiti kaa nirdhaaran ho saktaa he
 All these lines are a circle or part of a circle and the fraction is divided into minutes and seconds
 deshaantar rekhaayen uttari dhruv se dakshini dhruv tak khinchi rahati hai or is prakaar ardhvrutt hoti hai
 To determine the international time, the longitude line passing through the observatory at the Greinich location near London is called the principal longitude line
 issesh purv kii deshaantar rankhaayen purv deshaantar tathaa pashchim kii deshaantar rekhaayen pashchimi deshaantar rekhaayen kehalaati he
 The same line of 180 ° east or 180 ° west longitude is called the international date line, where the timetable of the east and western hemispheres is determined
 akshansh rekhaayen uttari tathaa dakshini dhruvon se samaan duuri par prithvi ke chaaron ore khichin jaati he or vrutt banaati he
 Their middle line is called the equator or equator, which is drawn at 0 ° 0 '0' and which divides the earth into two northern and southern halves

 To make a map, it is absolutely necessary to make a network of latitude and longitude lines based on the projection drawn on some method
 prakshepon kaa chunaav maanchitr ke prayojan par nirbhar karata he, jainse shuddh kshetrafal, shuddh disha athwa shuddh aakaar aadi vaanchhneeya tatwon main se kisi ek par ek maanchitr main vishesh dhyaan diya jaataa he
 These three properties are not found in one map interpolation
 prithvi kaa aakaar lagbhag goleey he
 Spheres of different dimensions have been used in different countries for determinations
 bhartiya maanchitron ke liye sweekrut golabh 'everest golabh' he
 Map projection is the method of representing the curved surface of the Earth on a flat surface by the representation of terrestrial reference lines on paper
 saamaanya rup se ye aakshaansh kii samaantar rekhaayen or deshaantar kii rekhaayen hai
 These are imaginary, but accurate mathematical lines of surface
 yah to prakat hi he ki bhumandal, jiskaa aakaar lagbhag goleey he, samtal prishth par thik thik nirupit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Therefore, projection is taken to represent the curved surface of the earth on flat paper
 uddeshy ke anusaar truti or vikruti ko icchit ansh tak simit yaa dur hataa diya jaataa he
 To maintain the shape it is necessary to take care of two things: ise samarupi prakshep kehete hai
 Homogeneous conical projections with appropriate manipulations are used for standard maps of the Survey of India
 maanchitr main bhu-akruti ke vibhinn swaroopon evam akritiyon ko dikhaanaa kathin kaary he
 The height of the landform means the height of the land from the sea level
 jahaan bhoomi samudratal se nichi he vahaan nichaai rinatmak chihn dwaara dikhaai jaati he evam oonchaai yaa nichaai foot yaa meter main dikhaai jaati he
 There are several methods of showing the landscape on the map: isamen kai vidhiyaan apanaai jaati he: rekhaachhadan vidhi -- is vidhi dwaara bahut patali patali choti rekhaon kii sahaayta se jalpravaah yaa dhaal kii disha dikhalaate hai
 The more sloping areas are represented by relatively thick and close-drawn lines
 maidaanon athwa pathaar ke samtal bhaagon ko shwet chhod dete hai
 The thickness of the lines is determined on the basis of mathematics for proper performance, but is often drawn on the basis of experience
 at: isse dhalkram kaa saadhaaran gyaan ho jaataa he, parantu bhu-akruti thik thik spasht nahin ho paati he or maanchitr main darshaae gaye pahari kshetron main itani adhik rekhaayen ho jaati hai ki bhu-akruti ke anya roopon kaa gyaan nahin ho saktaa
 It also takes more time to draw lines, so its use is decreasing
 adhik urdhwadhar paimaane par khinchi samocch rekhaon ke bich bich main chhichhli ghaatiyon, choti tekri aadi ke pradarshan main iskaa upyog hota he
 This includes vertical illumination and oblique illumination methods

 trikoshmetiya stesan - isamen trikoniya surveykshan dwaara nishchit kiye gaye steshnon ko unki unchaai ke saath dikhalaate hai, jaise d 200
 Contour lines - These are fictitious lines, drawn at equal distances on the map, joining places of equal height from the sea level
 ye adhik shuddh hoti he or inke vibhinn swaroopon se bhu-akritiyon kaa samuchit gyaan ho jaataa he
 Segmented line method - The lines are similar to contour lines, but they are shown between the contour lines by broken lines to show smaller geo-shapes as needed
 aajkal bhu-akruti ko dikhalaane ke liye kai vidhiyon ko saath saath upyog main laate hai, udhaahranswaroop samocch rekhaayen tathaa haishyur, samocch rekhaayen, haishyur tathaa sthanik unchaaiyaan samocch rekhaayen, khandit rekhaayen tathaa sthanik unchaaiyaan, samochcharekhaayen tathaa parvatiy chaaya vidhi or samocch rekhaayen tathaa starvarn
 The composition of maps and various related tools, knowledge and study of their principles and methods is called cartography
 In addition to the map, a variety of other tools are also made for displaying facts, such as relief models, ballasts, manracks, etc
 surveykshan kii upyukt vidhiyon se vibhinn surveykshan khandon kaa photo lekar kaali chhap taiyaar kii jaati he
 These are compiled by separate maps
 in sankalnon ke banane main bahut saavdhaanee baratani chahie, taaki surveykshanon kii parishuddhta bani rahe
 The black print is added to the map interpolation on which the trigonometric structure is inscribed
 yah isliye ki surveykshan kaa prayek bhaag thik maanchitrit sthitiyon main jam jaae
 The compilation is thus photographed in one-and-a-half times the size of the final publication and a collection of blue impressions is obtained on a fine sketch
 parivardhan kaa kaaran yah he ki antim prakaashan main rekhakriti kii spashtataa or sundarataa main vruddhi ho
 Due to the complexity of the details in the map, various natural and artificial shapes are presented in bright colors in terms of precision
 moulik rup se jalakritiyon ke liye nila, pahari tathaa marusthal ke liye bhura yaa usase miltaa julata, vanaspati ke liye haraa, krishi kshetra ke liye pilaa, sadak or bastiyon ke liye laal, pahari akruti or anya vivaranon, jaise strot, railway aadi ke liye kaale rang kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Use other colors for ancillary subjects like border strip, water etc
 achche rekhankan ke liye teen neeli chhap chahie
 a blueprint is used to draw the contour line of the hill and the desert

 main dehradun main ek or mudranalay chaalu hua
 The printing and selling of maps in the Office of the secretary-general had made rapid progress and from 1868, the printing of maps stopped in England
 tab se litho mudran pragati kar rahaa he or ab to vah ek vaigyanik vidhi ke rup main viksit ho gaya he
 Zinc plates are used in this method, which allows rotary offset machines to print thousands of copies per hour
 purvavarti paragraphon main varnit vidhi se shuddh rekhan dwaara praapt teen mul rekhachitron kaa sahi paimaane par photo liya jaataa he or kaach ke platon par 'geeli plate' vidhi dwaara unke negative taiyaar kiye jate hai
 The second copy is obtained by the 'churna method' from the negative of the third pure lined original, which contains the remaining details
 saar rup main is vidhi se vilag rang negative praapt karne ke liye sasta pratikrut negative praapt kiya jaataa he
 On one of the three negatives prepared by this method, all the details are engraved with the photopec, which are to be shown in blue and red color, leaving only those details to be printed in black
 isi prakaar anya do negativon par keval ve hi vivaran rahane dete hai jinhen kramash: nile or laal main prastut karnaa hota he or anya vivaranon ko alepit kar diya jaataa he
 The results of these three negatives are transferred to zinc plates
 ye plate kramash: kaale, laal or nile vivaran ke liye chapai ke plate ho jate hai
 Before starting printing, it is necessary to completely correct the errors that have been ingrained in the various processes carried out for the preparation of the zinc plate
 iske liye pramank mashin par ek pruf prati samay rangon main taiyaar kii jaati he
 Once the plates are certified, they are placed in printing machines
 aajkal kai prakaar kii aadhunik chapai mashine upyog main hai, kintu aadhunik chapai ke anivaary yantra 'swachaalit bharan' or 'rabar ofaset' hai
 In other words, paper filling in the machine is done with the instrument's own fill
