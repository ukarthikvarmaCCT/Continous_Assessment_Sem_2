 Due to the huge increase in population and erosion of cultivated land, now the production of rice / paddy has reduced and the need of Majuli itself is also not being met
 majuli dweep asamiya nav-vaishnav samskruti kaa kendra rahaa he
 The neo-vaishnavite ideology was started around the 15th century by the Assamese saint great man Srimanta Shankardev and his disciple Madhavdev
 in mahaan santon dwaara nirmit kai satr abhi bhi astitv main hai or asamiya samskruti kaa ang bane hue hai
 During his stay in Majuli, Srimanta Sankardev stayed here for a few months in a place called Belaguri in West Majuli
 isi sthaan par do mahaan santon, shrimant shankardev or madhavdev kaa mahamilan hua tha
 This historical meeting has great significance because after this a session of “manichachan Sanjog” was established in Belaguri
 haalanki yah satr ab astitv main nahin he
 Sixty-five sessions were established in Majuli after this session
 assam main kul 665 mul satron main se 65 majuli main sthit the
 Of the original sixty-five located in Majuli, only twenty-two exist now
 kuch satr bhukataav ke chalate villin ho gaye or kuch satr sahi parichaalan ke abhaav main nahin rahe
 The major sessions of Majuli which are still in existence are the following: ye satr “bargit”, ‘’matiakhaara’’, satreey nrity jaise- jhumora nrity, chali nrity, natua nrity, nande bhringi, sutaradhar, ojhapalli, apsara nrity, satreey krishna nrity, dashavathar nrity aadi ke sangrakshak sthal hai
 All these were promulgated by Srimanta Sankardev
 kamalabari satr Southbound session dakshinpaat satr main puja uni-session jorhat shahar se maatr 20 kilometre kii duuri par sthit majuli dweep, ek prakritik or saanskrithik viraasat sthal ke rup main mana jaataa he
 The Vaishnava sessions of Majuli have been a very good medium for propagating the socio-cultural principles of the state
 yahan 16veen shatabdi ke baad se bane anek satr dekhe ja sakate he
 In these sessions, tourists can see the extensive collection of ancient Assamese artifacts, weapons, utensils, textiles, jewelery and handicrafts and feel the heritage of Assam
 in satron main vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai- kamalabari satr, uttar kamalabari satr, samaguri satr, garmudh satr, ouniati satr, benguenaati satr, dakshinpaat satr ityadi
 In November, there is a 3-day Raas Utsav which is visited by people from far and wide
 saal bhar yahan rang birange saanskrithik kaarykram yojit hote rahete hai jo paryatakon ko bahut bhaate hai
 People of different tribes live here
 unke gaanvo main samay bitaakar unhen or unki samskruti ko janaa ja saktaa he
 Their food habits, the art of living in difficult circumstances, etc
 can be understood

 Tourists also enjoy this festival quite a lot
 is ke alaava, yahan mukhute, mitti ke bartan, muga resham kii bunai jaise hastshilp or hathkargha utpaadon ko dekha yaa karidaa ja saktaa he
 People come from all over the world to see and study its natural beauty and biodiversity
 yahan anek prajatiyon ke durlabh or luptpraaya pravasi pakshiyon kaa avaagaman chalata rahata he
 These include migratory birds such as pelican, Siberian cranes and Greater Adjutant cranes
 in pakshiyon ko dekhne ke liye november se march ke bich kaa samay sabase uttam hota hai
 There are three such spots from where these birds can be seen - the southeast area of majuli Island, the southwestern area of majuli Island and the northern part of Majuli Island
 majuli main saal ke kisi bhi vaqt bhraman kiya ja saktaa he
 During the rainy season, 50-70% of the island is flooded, but ironically it is easier to travel by boat at this time of the year
 prakritik sundarata bhi isi samay apane charam par hoti he
 Infrastructure for tourism in Majuli has not been developed
 yahan koi bhi bada nagar he na hi yahan koi achche hotel hai
 The largest cities are Kamlabari and Garamudh
 yahan kuch madhya nimna str ke hotel zarur hai
 There are some guest houses of Assam government like "circuit House", "inspection Bungalows" but they are limited in number and away from the reach of common tourist
 yahan assam paryaton vibhaag kaa "prasanti tourist loj" bhi he, parantu yah bhi simit sankhya main hi touriston ko rakh saktaa he
 Some "sessions" provide rooms for tourists
 iske liye pehle se hi satr parichaalak se sampark karnaa aavashyak he
 Such rooms are available in Natun Kamlabari, North Kamlabari, Auniati, Bhogpur and Dakshinpat sessions, for specific information for Majuli tourism, you can contact in the following places- majuli assam ke vidhansabha samshti ke 99 number nirvachan kshetra ke antargat aata he

 jeevashmiki yaa jeevashm vigyaan yaa palantology, bhoumiki kii vah shakha he jiskaa sambandh bhoumikeey yugon ke un praaniyon or padpon ke avasheshon se he jo ab bhuparpati ke shailon main hi paae jate hai
 Tweb Hoeffel and Auck, giving a definition of fossilism, wrote: Paleontology is the science that explains the life of past geological ages revealed by the primitive plants and the putrid remains of animals
 is prakaar yah spasht he ki jeevashm vigyaan adikalin jeevajantuon kaa, une ashmibhoot avasheshon ke aadhaar par adhyayan karata he
 The word fossil itself indicates that there is a study of Jiva + Ashram
 angreji kaa Palaentology shabd bhi Palaios = pracheen + Onto = jeev ke adhyayan kaa nirdesh karata he
 The study of paleontology is a new branch of biology and it has developed over the last 200 years
 vigyaan kii is shakha ke vikaas ke bahut pehle se adimanav kii jaankaree main yah tha ki kuch prakaar ke shailon main ek vicitra prakaar ke avshesh paae jate hai jo samudri jeevon ke anuroop hote hai
 In the absence of knowledge, he first considered these relics as not having biological origin, but the contents of the humor of nature, which became due to some power inside the earth
 parantu shanai:-shanai: gyaan kii vruddhi ke saath saath manushya ko is disha main bhi apane vichaaron ko badalanaa padaa or usne yah pataa laga liya ki shailon main paae janevaale avasheshon ke praani kisi na kisi samay main jeevat jeev the or vah sthaan jahaan par ham aaj in jeevashmon ko pate hai bhoumikeey yugon main samudr ke garbh main tha
 By 1820, only 127 herbaceous flora and 2,100 animals were detected, which by 1840 had increased to 2,050 and 24,300 respectively
 tab se ab tak in sankhyaon main abhootpurv vruddhi hui he
 It is not possible under human capacity that all the world's sources of fossils are discovered
 duusare, prithvi par jeevon kii utpatti arabon varsh purv se hi hoti ai he
 Third, the geographical shape of the world as it is seen today, was not there in those days
 jeev jantu ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par chale jaaya karte the
 Therefore, the knowledge that we may or may have gained from their vulgar samples is different, or will be
 ant main yah kabhi sambhav nahin he ki jitne bhi jeevajantu itihaas ke us andhkaar yug main upasthit the, un sabakaa ashmikaran ho hi gaya ho
 There are some conditions of vulgarization, due to which the dead bodies of the fauna are vulgarized
 sabhi jeevon kaa ashmikaran na to aavyashyak hi he, na hi sambhav he
 For this reason too, it is difficult to write a series history of the life of the primitive creatures
 ab tak jitne bhi jeevashmiya pramaan hamen praapt ho chuke hai, unke aadhaar par jeevon ke kramik vikaas par acha khaasaa prakaash padataa he
 The study of fossils gives us an idea of the organisms which are now either extinct, or their present form has changed enough
 jeevashm pracheen jeevon ke ve avshesh hai, jo shilakhandon yaa anya sthanon par pathar jaise ho gaye hai
 Some such remains of creatures have also been found, which are in their original form rather than preserved
 himsagariya kshetron main praapt maimathon tathaa anya jantuon ke mrit sharir rus tathaa england or america ke sangrahalayon main surakshit hai
 Fossils also resemble, in modular form, the shape of modern organisms
 jeevashm keval avsaadee shilakhandon main hi mila karte hai
 After the death of many types of animals, the depression that accumulates on their dead bodies after death, they become fossils only over time
 kuch jeevashm to itane purna hai ki unki anvikshikeey pariksha karne par jeevon kii koshika tak kii rachanaayen spasht dikh padati hai
 It is not necessary to get obscene evidence of the living as its living body
 unke shavon main sadandh, oxikaran, hinsak jeevon dwaara vikrut kar dene, sheet, varsha, dhoop aadi ke kaaran vikaar utpann ho jaataa he
 Some animals, whose bodies are made up of inorganic materials such as calcium carbonate, silica, etc
, have relatively little effect on the disorder
 aise jeevon ke jeevashm bahut kam sankhya main uplabdh hai
 Even those that are available are incomplete to compare with modern living organisms
 jeevon kii ek anya visheshta yah bhi he ki ek prakaar ke jeevashm kuch vishesh prakaar ke shilakhandon main hi milte hai
 From these rocks, knowledge of the environment of the entire life of fossils is obtained
 jeevashmon se yah bhi maaloom hota he ki jeev kaise sthaan par rahaa karata tha or kya khaataa-peetaa tha
 They also throw light on the then geographical conditions

 Especially in the far north polar region of Siberia, almost complete life has been found

 Generally, the hard parts of the body of the animals - bones, teeth, shell etc
 - are restored

 Over time, they become so rigid that if the upper shell is broken, then an image-like replica goes inside

 These footprints do not only know the composition and shape of the soles of the feet of the animals, but also the direction of their movement

 Their chemical study gives knowledge of the diet of those animals
 kuch samudri machhliyon tathaa anya jantuon kii annanali main duusari choti machhliyaan yaa keede makode, pashupakshi, adhpake maance aadi bhi paae gaye hai
 These fossils should be considered as the past, because they provide evidence of the state of the Earth millions of millions of years ago

 Some of its major utilities are: kalanukramik -jeevashmon main utkeern athwa sampurna yaa apurna rup main praapt pramaanon ke aadhaar par pracheen bhugarbhik avasthaa kaa pataa chalata he
 Fossils are of great help in determining a geologic period

 His appearance was great, it has made a difference

 Therefore, it is difficult to determine their antiquity with mineral-rich rocks
 kintu unke bich praapt jeevashmon ke avsaadon kaa adhyayan karne par yah kaary saral ho jaataa he
 Some fossils have been referred to as instructional fossils on the basis that they prove that certain animals or vegetation originated or may have occurred only in geological times
 aadim parivesh -jeevon ke jivan ke liye, chaahe ve vanaspatiyaan ho, chaahe jaanavar, vishesh prakaar ke bhugolic vaataavaran hi upyukt hote hai
 In other words, we can say that animals of a particular kind survive in a particular environment
 jeevashmon se pataa chalata he ki tatkaaleen jeev jantuon ke jeevanyaapan ke liye kis prakaar kaa bhugolic vaataavaran tha
 Fossils also give a glimpse of how these animals died or at what place at which stage
 iske saath hi pracheen bhoomi, sagar, jalashay aadi kii seemaa tathaa vistaar, jantuon or pakshiyon ke parvrajan aadi par bhi jeevashm prachur prakaash daalate hai
 The result of the study of these fossils is that the composition of ancient geographical maps can be simple and accessible
 jeevashmon dwaara prakat bhugolic parivesh ke adhyayan ke liye ab ek naveen vigyaan kaa janm ho chukaa he, jise purabhugol kehete hai
 Ancient Ecology - Living beings need a wide variety of environments to survive
 kuch jeev anya jeevon ke sharir ke upar yaa bheetar rahakar jeevanyaapan karte hai; inhen paraseete yaa parashrayi kehete hai
 Some organisms spend their lives in close contact with or engaging with other organisms

 Evolution of organisms - Charitable evidence is one of the corroborative evidence or arguments that his supporters present to confirm Darwin's theory of evolution of organisms

 Similarly, solutions to many other problems related to growth have been fossilized
 jeevashm vigyaan kai shakhaon main vibhakt kiya gaya he
 From the convenience point of view, it has now become a rule that when we use the word 'fossilology', we only mean the study of fossils of invertebrates
 jeevashmiki kii jis shakha ke antargat kasheruk jeevashmon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he use kasheruki jeevashm vigyaan kehete hai
 Plant fossils are studied under a different branch called phytosemiology
 aadhunik samay main jeevashmiki kii kuch anya pramukh shakhaon kaa bhi vikaas hua he, jinke adhyayan kaa kshetra kramash: ati laghu jeev or jeevashm maanav hai
 The field of paleontology is very wide and its limits cannot be determined definitively
 yadi saidhantik drushti se dekha jaae, to jeevashmiki kaa abhyuday prithvi par jeev ke pradurbhaav ke saath saath prarambh ho jaataa he, parantu bhoumikeey aadhaar par keval itnaa hi kaha saktaa he ki prithvi par sampurna jeev ke itihaas ke aadhe, yaa usase bhi kam ke, jeevon ke abhilekh hamen milte hai
 The beginning of fossil scientific investigations can be done from the oldest attainable fossils whose biological properties can be described on biological basis
 jeevashmiki kaa bhoumiki, visheshkar starit-shail-bhoumiki, se ati ghanishtha sambandh he
 Remnants of past living creatures are found in layered rocks
 in shailon ke nirmaan ke vishay main or unka anukram sthapit karne main unamem paae janevaale jeevashm bahut sahaayak siddh hue hai
 Actually layered-shell-geology without fossils is, in a way, practical paleontology
 jeevashmiki kaa jaiviki ke saath ghanishtha sambandh he
 Current biology and plants are studied under biology, while in biology, organisms and plants of geological ages that once lived and are now available only as fossils are studied
 lekin jeevashmiki ko jaiviki kii ek shakha nahin mana ja saktaa he, kyonki jeevashmiki ke adhyayan kii saamagree or uske sangrah kaa dhang jaiviki ke adhyayan kii saamagree or uske sangrah ke dhang se sarvatha bhinn hai
 Determining where fossilology can be separated from biology is often impossible
 parantu mote taur se jeevashm kaa ant or jaiviki kaa prarambh atyant-nutan yug or aadhunik yug ke sandhisthan se le sakate hai
 In this way, there are many and different types of fauna remains found between the indeterminate and suspicious pre-cambrian prehistoric animals and plants and between the present and certain types of organisms and plants, which throw light on the organism
 bhuparpati ke avsaadee shailon main milanevaale ye jeevashm hi, jeevashmiki ke adhyayan ke aadhaar hai
 Biologists are very interested in paleontology because it is closely related to a subject like biology
 praaniyon or padpon kii jatiyon kaa itihaas athwa jativrutt, starit shailon ke anukramit staron se praapt kiye jeevashmon ke adhyayan ke aadhaar par adhik vishwaspurvak anurekhit kiya ja saktaa he
 However, due to incomplete record of organisms, the tracing of their genealogies is highly hindered, as only a few of the animals and plants found in the geological ages and most of them in incomplete condition are found reflected in these rocks
 abhilekh kii is apurnataa ke baavjood anek jeevavarg main, jab unka anurekhan shailon ke ek str se duusare str main kiya jaataa he tab, shanai: shanai: parivartan hone lagate hai
 When the patterns of fossils are collected from different indexed levels, the two distinctly visible species are directly related to the interstitial fossils and the fossils of intermediate levels ranging from the lowest found species to the highest
 Changes in the life of animals can be seen
 jeevashmon se jativrutt kaa pataa lagane ke liye, stareey reeti ke atirikt sharir tathaa vyativrutt kii tulanaatmak ritiyon kaa bhi prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Hence, fossilism confirms the notion that biology developed as a result of changes occurring gradually
 is baat ke bataane kaa bhi pramaan he ki jeev vikaas niyatvikasiya tha
 This is to say that the biologic changes in the class of certain organisms occurred in a certain direction till ages and apart from this, the associated classes which are of the same ancestral origin, without being influenced by each other and external conditions, are similar in their evolution
 Stages or similar states, indicating that the direction of development in the various classes of organisms, By Vj is determined by paternal qualities
 jivit padpon or praaniyon kaa eckoshika andey se le karke antim dasha tak vikaas kii sampurna avasthaaon kaa anurekhan karnaa, bhraumiki or jeevaritti ke antargat aata he
 The evolution of the species of plants and animals of a class is almost the same, at least in its early stages, and the entire embryos within a class have so much homogeneity in one state until another that they cannot be separated
 is tathy ne un aakaaron main atyadhik bandhutav pragat kiya he, jo praudhavastha main ek duusare se atyadhik bhinn hote hai
 The reality of this is seen in vertebrates, whose embryos can be separated from each other with great difficulty in the initial stages and which very slowly bear the characteristic figures of their class or body
 in bhruneey anveshanon ke parinaamon kaa jeevashmiki ke saath vishesh sambandh he
 There are many fossils in the information that show signs of embryonic, or at least, fleshy, or adolescent, compared to modern organisms related to themselves
 isprakaar ke aadim awa bhruneey prakaaron ke udhaaharan kasherukon main vishesh karke dekhne ko milte hai, kyonki inamen kankal jivan ke ati praarambhik kaal hi main ashmibhoot ho jate hai
 Therefore, the late stages of modern organisms can be directly compared with adult fossils
 jeevashmon ko nishchit naam dena jeevashm vigyaani ke liye isliye mahatv kaa he ki jeevashmon main vah adhik yatharth vibhed kar sake
 The nomenclature of fossils is generally based on the same principles on which creatures
 pranijagat anek sanghon main vibhakt he or prayek sangh anek virgon, ganon, kulon, vanshon or jatiyon main vibhakt he
 There are many types of fossils
 yadi anveshak kisi jati ke jeevashm ke ek praturup ke aadhaar par us sampurna jati kaa varnan karata he, to vah jeevashm praturup us jati kaa naam praroop kehalaata he
 If the investigator takes the help of other fossil specimens to determine the name of one, these additional specimens are called paratypes
 yadi anveshak bina namprarup kaa nishchay kiye hi kai anya jeevashm namoonon kii sahaayta letaa he, to in jeevashm namoonon ko sahpraroop kehete hai
 If the fossil form of a caste is chosen after the initial description of that caste, then the fossil type is called the lectotype
 jis prakaar ek jati ke varnan ke liye jeevashm namoonay hote hai usee prakaar ek vansh ke varnan ke liye praroop jati athwa samajini jeevashm hote hai
 If an investigator describes a new lineage based on a particular race, then that caste becomes a genholotype for that lineage
 yadi anveshak nae vansh ke varnan main aisi jatiyon kii suchi de detaa he jinako vah yah samajhataa he ki ve nae vansh ke antargat aate hai, to in sab jatiyon ko jenocentip kehete hai
 Many of the genosyntypes can be sorted later by the ADI investigator or later by another investigator
 bhoumikeey kaal paanch brihat bhaagon main banta hua he
 These are respectively inamen orkiyozoik mahakalp sabase pracheen he
 The division of these five mahakalpas of the geological period is mainly based on the fossils of animals and plants found in these mahakalpas
 inamen se orkiyozoik mahakalp jeevashoonya tha
 There were no animals and plants of any kind in this great cycle
 at: is kaal ke shailon main hamako kisi bhi prakaar ke jeevashm nahin milte hai
 In Pragjivik Mahakalpa, very simple organisms like protozoa came into existence
 parantu in saadhaaran jeevon main kisi bhi prakaar ke kade bhaag ke abhaav ke kaaran ve shailon main parirakshit na ho sake
 Therefore, fossils are not found even in the rocks of Pragjivan Mahakalpa
 anya teenon mahakalp, arthath purajivi mahakalp madhyajivi mahakalp or nutanjivi mahakalp jeevashmamay hai
 All the divisions from small to large that come under these great concepts are based solely on the fossils of the organisms found in that period
 at: ham dekhte hai ki starit shailavigyaani kaa kaam bina jeevashm vigyaan kii sahaayta ke nahin chal saktaa
 This is why paleontology is called the backbone of layered rock science
 mote taur par jeevashm vigyaan ke adhaar par nimnlikhi chaar mukhya praani tathaa padap jaateey mahakalp sthapit kiye ja sakate hai : Former archaeological Mahakalpa - This includes Cambrian, Ordovision and Silurian kalpa
 uttar purajivi mahakalp - iske antargat deoni, carboni or parmian kalp aaten hai
 Intermediate survival nutanjeev mahakalp - abhinav kaal bhi iske antargat he
 Representative fossils of almost all major invertebrates are found in the Cambrian strata, and some of them, such as the trilobite, were more developed than they were in the Adicambrian period
 at: yah dhaaran ki cambrian staron main paae janevaale sab virgon ke purvaj cambrian purv kaal main paae jate the, bilkul uchit he, yadhyapi unke avshesh cambrian purv shailon main nahin milte
 It is conceivable that all kinds of beings lived in the pre-cambrian seas, but they were all Komalangi ancestors, who have not left any signs of their existence
 chunki sab prakaar ke praani pratyaksh athwa apratyaksh rup se paudhon par nirbhar rahete hai or paudhon main hi keval acarbonic khaadya padaarth ke paripachan kii shakti hoti he, at: yah bhi dharna uchit prathit hoti he ki cambrian purv kaal main paudhe astitv main the
 But it is surprising that the remains of plants have not been found in the levels of the archaeological Mahakalpa
 purvapurajivi mahakalp ke pranijagat ke mukhya lakshanon kaa sankshipt varnan is prakaar he : This was the era of Matsya and Parnaung similar plant plants, called Teridosperms
 inke saath goniotites, spiriferid bahupad or ryugos pravaal paae jate the
 The intergalactic Mahakalpa is called the kalpa of reptiles and ammonities
 inke saath belemnoities brackeopoda main rinkonilids or pravaalon kii bhi pradhanta thi
 This kalpa was the period of mammals, birds, foraminifers and angiosperms
 praani or padpon ke aadhaar par ham nutanjeev mahakalp ko aadhunik samay se pruthak nahin rakh sakate
 After the sequence of complete rocks was well established and the fossils found in them were identified, it was found that there was gradual progress in the development of organisms
 ati saadhaaran prakaar ke jeev sabase pehle prakat hue, jo sabase pracheen avsaadee shailon main paae jate hai or inke uparaant jatiltar jeev kramash: taruntar shailon main aate gaye
 Thus representatives of entire invertebrate associations, which are preserved in fossil form, are found in Cambrian rocks, but the organisms found under each association were often similar in their composition and showed very little change
 aakaareeya aadhaar par ham unhen alpaviksit vansh kah sakate hai, parantu baad ke yugon main paae janevaale sanghon me se prayek sangh main milanevaale jeevon kii rachana adhik bhinn thi or is tathy kii pushti kisi seemaa tak vanshon kii sankhya main vruddhi se ho jaati he
 The vertebrates are the Cyclosotomata class, considered primitive classes based on composition, which first emerged and were followed by fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, respectively, and these classes appeared in the same order as expected from their creation

 The study of the development of the horse is a good example for rendering biologic theory
 vah sampurna saamagree jis par ghode ke vikaas kaa itihaas aadhaarit he, uttari america ke tritiyak shailon se praapt kii gai he
 The main directions of its development are: aakaar main vruddhi, gati main vruddhi, sir or greeva main vruddhi
 The oldest fossil of the horse is the Eohypus, which has been found in the lower Eocene rocks and was in shape from cat to fox
 madhya iosin kaa ghoda orohipus ke naam se janaa jaataa he, jo aakaar main iohipus se kuch hi bada tha
 Answer: The horse of the Eocene is called Ephippus, the subject of which is not fully known
 mesohipus ke naam se prachlit ghoda, nimnatar or madhya oligosin shailon main miltaa he
 It was equal to, or somewhat smaller than, a lamb in size 
 myohipus, jo uttar oligosin or nimnatar myosin yug main paaya jaataa tha, bhed se kuch hi bade aakaar kaa tha
 Parahippus was very abundant in the lower Myocene age
 madhya myosin kaa ghoda, mericups kehalaata tha
 Which was similar to Parahippus itself
 plyosin yug kaa ghoda, plyohipus aakaar main gadhe ke baraabar tha, par tritiyak yug main milanevaala ghada vartmaan kaal main paae janevaale ghode ke baraabar tha

 After Premchand, the people who worked to advance literature with social concerns and progressive values include from Yashpal to Muktibodh
 premchand kaa janm 31 july 1880 ko varanasi ke nikat lamahi gaanv main hua tha
 His mother's name was Anandi Devi and father Munshi Ajayabarya was a postman in Lamhi
 unki shiksha kaa aarambh urdu, farsi se hua or jeevanyaapan kaa adhyaapan se padhane kaa shauk unhen bachapan se hi lag gaya

 His early life was a struggle because his mother died at the age of seven and his father died at the age of fourteen
 unka pehla vivaah un dinon kii parampara ke anusaar pandrah saal kii umr main hua jo safal nahin rahaa
 He was influenced by the Arya Samaj, which was a major religious and social movement at that time
 unhone vidhwaa-vivaah kaa samarthan kiya or 1906 main doosraa vivaah apni pragatisheel parampara ke anuroop bal-vidhwaa shivarani devi se kiya
 They had three children - Sripat Rai, Amrit Rai and Kamala Devi Srivastava
 1910 main unki rachana soje-vatan ke liye hamirpur ke jila colector ne talab kiya or un par janata ko bhadakaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 All copies of Soje-watan were confiscated and destroyed
 colector ne nawabrai ko hidaayat di ki ab ve kuch bhi nahin likhenge, yadi likhaa to jail bhej diya jayega
 By this time Premchand used to write under the name Dhanpat Rai
 urdu main prakashit hone vaali zamana patrika ke sampadak or unke ajij dost munshi dayanarayan nigam ne unhen premchand naam se likhane kii salaah di
 After this, he started writing in the name of Premchand

 "much of the discussion of Indian literature that emerged from prominence later, whether it is Dalit literature or women's literature, has its roots somewhere deep in Premchand's literature
 " premchand ke lekh 'pehali rachana' ke anusaar unki pehali rachana apane mamaa par likhaa vyangy thi, jo ab anuplabdh he
 His first available writing is his Urdu novel Asrar Maabid
 premchand kaa doosraa upanyaas 'hamakhurma va hamsawab' jiskaa hindi roopantaran 'prema' naam se 1907 main prakashit hua
 This was followed by Premchand's first story collection called soze-watan which was published in 1908
 soje-vatan yani desh kaa dard
 Fueled by patriotism, it was banned by the English government and warned its author not to do such writing in future
 iske kaaran unhen naam badalakar likhnaa padaa
 His first story titled 'premchand' was published in the December 1910 issue of Bada Ghar Ki Beti Zamana magazine
 maranoparant unki kahaniyaan maansarovar naam se 8 khandon main prakashit hui
 The story said that Emperor Premchand said that the litterateur is not the truth behind patriotism and politics, but rather the truth which shows the torch before him
 yah baat unke sahitya main ujagar hui he
 In 1921, he quit his job at the call of Mahatma Gandhi
 kuch maheene maryaada patrika kaa sampadan bhaar sambhala, chah saal tak maadhuri naamak patrika kaa sampadan kiya, 1930 main banaras se apana masik patr hans shuru kiya or 1932 ke aarambh main jaagran naamak ek saptahik or nikaala
 He presided over the conference of the All India Progressive Writers Association in 1936 in Lucknow

 Wrote the story of a film titled Mazdoor, released in 1934, and without completing the year-long period of contract, escaped to Benares, leaving two months' salary because he did not like the air and water of the film world in Bombay and more
 unhone mul rup se hindi main 1915 se kahaniyaan likhnaa or 1918 se upanyaas likhnaa shuru kiya
 Premchand wrote a total of nearly three hundred stories, about a dozen novels and many articles
 unhone kuch naatak bhi likhe or kuch anuwaad kaary bhi kiya
 Many literary works of Premchand were translated into many languages including English, Russian, German
 godaan unki kaaljayi rachana he
 Kafan is believed to be his final story
 unhone hindi or urdu main puure adhikaar se likhaa
 Most of his compositions originally written in Urdu, but they went first publication was in Hindi
 taintis varshon ke rachanaatmak jivan main ve sahitya kii aisi viraasat saunp gaye jo gunon kii drushti se amuly he or aakaar kii drushti se aseemit
 Premchand's composition and vision came in various literary forms
 bahumukhi pratibha sampann premchand ne upanyaas, kahani, naatak, samiksha, lekh, sampadakeey, sansmaran aadi anek vidhaon main sahitya kii sristi kii
 He was prominently known as a storyteller and during his lifetime he was awarded the title of 'novel Emperor'
 unhone kul 15 upanyaas, 300 se kuch adhik kahaniyaan, 3 naatak, 10 anuwaad, 7 bal-pustaken tathaa hajaaron prishthon ke lekh, sampadakeey, bhaashan, bhoomika, patr aadi kii rachana kii lekin jo yash or pratishtha unhen upanyaas or kahaniyon se praapt hui, vah anya vidhaon se praapt na ho saki
 This situation appears equally in both Hindi and Urdu languages
 premchand ke upanyaas na keval hindi upanyaas sahitya main balki sampurna bhartiya sahitya main mile ke pathar hai
 Premchand first begins his novelist in fiction
 unka pehla urdu upanyaas ‘asaraare maaabid urf devsthan rahasy’ urdu saptahik ‘'aawaaj-e-khalq'’ main 8 oktober, 1903 se 1 farvari, 1905 tak dharawahik rup main prakashit hua
 His second novel 'hamkhurma aur Humswab', a Hindi adaptation of which was published in 1907 under the name 'prema'
 chunki premchand mul rup se urdu ke lekhak the or urdu se hindi main aae the, isliye unke sabhi aarambhik upanyaas mul rup se urdu main likhe gaye or baad main unka hindi tarjuma kiya gaya
 He entered the world of Hindi novel from the novel 'sevasadan'
 yah mul rup se unhone 'bajaare-husn' naam se pehle urdu main likhaa lekin iskaa hindi rup 'sevasadan' pehle prakashit karaayaa
 'sevasadan' is the story of a woman becoming a prostitute
 dow ramvilas sharma ke anusaar 'sevasadan' main vyakt mukhya samasya bhartiya nari kii paradheenata he
 After this came his first novel 'premashram' on peasant life
 iskaa masauda bhi pehle urdu main 'goshaae-aafiyat' naam se taiyaar hua tha lekin 'sevasadan' kii bhaanti ise pehle hindi main prakashit karaayaa
 'premashram' is probably the first novel in Hindi written on peasant life
 yah avadh ke kisaan andolanon ke daur main likhaa gaya
 After this, the journey through 'rangbhoomi', 'rejuvenation', 'nirmala', 'drone', 'karmabhoomi' was completed to 'godan'
 rangabhumi main premchand ek andhe bhikhaari surdaas ko katha kaa nayak banaakar hindi katha sahitya main krantikari badlaav kaa sutarapaat kar chuke the
 Godan has an important place not only in Hindi literature but also in world literature
 isamen premchand kii sahitya sambandhi vichaardhaara 'aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad' se 'aalochanatmak yatharthwaad' tak kii purnataa praapt karti he
 Creating a common peasant hero of the novel was like to change the course of the novel tradition
 samantvaad or poonjeevaad ke chakra main funskar hui kathanayake hori kii mrityu pathakon ke jahan ko jhakzor kar rakh jaati he
 In his previous novels 'premashram' and 'karmabhoomi' on peasant life, while presenting the Premchand reality, he embraces the ideal till the end of the novel
 lekin godaan kaa kaarunik ant is baat kaa gavaah he ki tab tak premchand kaa adarshavaad se mohabhang ho chukaa tha
 This can also be seen in his last period stories
 'mangalsutra' premchand kaa adhuraa upanyaas he
 The original story of Premchand's novels was Indian rural life
 premchand ne hindi upanyaas ko jo oonchaai pradaan kii, vah parvarti upanyaaskaaron ke liye ek chunauti bani rahi
 Premchand's novels were translated into many languages of India and the world, especially his most popular novel Godan
 inaki adhiktar kahaniyon main nimna va madhyam varg kaa chithran he

 Popular stories of Premchand ji premchand ne 'sangram', 'karbala' or 'prem kii vedi' naatakon kii rachana kii
 These plays are good at the level of craftsmanship and compassion, but their stories and novels have attained such a height that Premchand did not get much success in the field of drama
 ye naatak vastutah sanvadatmak upanyaas hi ban gaye hai
 Premchand was not only a sensitive storyteller, but also a vigilant citizen and editor
 unhone 'hans', 'maadhuri', 'jaagran' aadi patr-patrikaon kaa sampadan karte hue va tatkaaleen anya sahagaami saahitiyik patrikaon 'chaand', 'maryaada', 'swadesh' aadi main apni saahitiyik va saamaajik chintaaon ko lekhon yaa nibandhon ke madhyam se abhivyakt kiya

 The Hindi translation of 'fasan-e-azad', the Urdu novel of Ratannath Sarshar, by him, 'azad Katha' became very famous
 premachand urdu kaa sanskaar lekar hindi main aae the or hindi ke mahaan lekhak bane
 Gave Hindi its special idiom and openness

 He established a strong urge for timeliness in literature
 aam aadmi ko unhone apni rachanaaon kaa vishay banaaya or uski samasyaon par khulkar kalam chalaate hue unhen sahitya ke nayakon ke pad par asin kiya
 Before Premchand, Hindi literature was entangled in the stories of the king-queen, the thrill
 premchand ne sahitya ko sachai ke dharaatal par utaara
 He brought out the truth of life and time
 ve sampradayikta, bhrashtachar, jameendaari, karjakhori, garibi, upniveshwaad par aaajeevan likhte rahe
 Most of Premchand's compositions tell the story of his poverty and poverty
 ye bhi galat nahin he ki ve aam bhartiya ke rachanaakaar the
 He became a hero in his creations, which Indian society deemed untouchable and disgusting
 unhone saral, sahaj or aam bol-chaal kii bhashaa kaa upyog kiya or apane pragatisheel vichaaron ko dridhtaa se tark dete hue samaaj ke saamne prastut kiya
 Presiding over the first conference of the Progressive Writers Association in 1936, he said that the writer is progressive by nature and he who is not, is not a writer
 premchand hindi sahitya ke yug pravartak hai
 He started a new tradition of idealistic realism in Hindi story
 itane mahaan rachanaakaar hone ke baavjood premchand kaa jivan aaropon se mukt nahin he
 Kamalkishore Goenka, a scholar of Premchand, in his book 'premchand: New Directions of Study', tried to reduce the importance of his literature by making some allegations on Premchand's life
 premchand par lage mukhya aarope hai- premchand ne apni pehali patni ko bina vajah choda or duusare vivaah ke baad bhi unke anya kisi mahila se sambandh rahe, premchand ne 'jaagran vivaad' main vinodashankar vyas ke saath dhokhaa kiya, premchand ne apni press ke varisht karmchaaree pravasilal verma ke saath dhokhaadhadi kii, premchand kii press main mazdooron ne hadtaal kii, premchand ne apni beti ke biimaar hone par jhaad-phoonk kaa sahaara liya aadi
 These allegations made by Kamalkishore Goenka do bring to us a side of Premchand's life, which reveals his human weaknesses but the evaluation of his extensive literature has no effect on these allegations
 premchand ko praayah "munshi premchand" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 When and how did 'munshi' become associated with Premchand's name? Most of the people in this subject believe that Premchand was a teacher in the beginning
 adhyapakon ko praaia: us samay munshi ji kaha jaataa tha
 Apart from this, there has been a tradition of putting the word 'munshi' as a form of honor before the names of Kayasthas
 sambhavat: premchand ji ke naam ke saath munshi shabd judakar rudh ho gaya
 According to Professor Shukdev Singh, Premchand never used the word 'munshi' himself in front of his name
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki munshi shabd sammaan suchak he, jise premchand ke prashansakon ne kabhi laga diya hoga
 This fact is based on conjecture
 lekin premchand ke naam ke saath munshi visheshan judane kaa pramanik kaaran yah he ki 'hans' naamak patr premchand evam 'kanhaiyalaal munshi' ke sah sampadan main nikalataa tha
 On some copies of which Kanhaiyalal Munshi's full name was not printed, but 'munshi' was printed and also Premchand's name was printed in this way
 sampadakmunshi, premchand'hans ke sampadak premchand tathaa kanhaiyalaal munshi the
 But over time, the readers accepted 'munshi' and 'premchand' as one and became 'premchand' - 'munshi Premchand'
 yah swaabhaavik bhi he
 The general reader often reads the author's works, not seeing the subtlety of the name
 aaj premchand kaa munshi alankaran itnaa rudh ho gaya he ki maatr 'munshi' se hi premchand kaa bodh ho jaataa he tathaa 'munshi' na kehane se premchand kaa naam adhuraa-adhuraa sa lagata he
 Premchand did many experiments to reach the pinnacle of his art
 jis yug main premchand ne kalam uthaai thi, us samay unke peeche aisi koi thos viraasat nahin thi or na hi vichaar or pragatishiltaa kaa koi model hi unke saamne tha sivaay bangla sahitya ke
 At that time Bankim was Babu, Sharat Chandra and in addition there were Russian writers like Tolstoy
 lekin hote-hote unhone godaan jaise kaaljayi upanyaas kii rachana kii jo ki ek aadhunik clasik mana jaataa he
 He coined and shaped things himself
 jab bharat kaa swatantraaa andolan chal rahaa tha tab unhone katha sahitya dwaara hindi or urdu donon bhashaaon ko jo abhivyakti di usne siyaasi sargarmi ko, josh ko or andolan ko sabhi ko ubhaara or use taaqatvar banaaya or isse unka lekhan bhi taaqatvar hota gaya
 Premchand can certainly be called the first progressive writer of Hindi in this sense
 1936 main unhone pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke pehle sammelan ko sabhapati ke rup main sambodhan kiya tha
 His speech became the basis of the manifesto of the progressive movement
 premchand ne hindi main kahani kii ek parampara ko janm diya or ek puri peedi unke kadamon par aage badi, 50-60 ke dashak main renu, nagarjun auki inke baad shrinath singh ne gramin parivesh kii kahaniyaan likhi hai, wo ek tarah se premchand kii parampara ke taratamya main aati hai
 Premchand was a revolutionary creator, he saw not only patriotism but also many evil practices prevalent in the society and put them before the people through the story
 unhone us samay ke samaaj kii jo bhi samasyaayen thim un sabhi ko chitrit karne kii shuruyaat kar di thi
 Dalits also come in it, women also
 ye sabhi vishay aage chalakar hindi sahitya ke bade vimarsh bane

 iske baad beringia or asia ke bich bhi ek barf kii diwaar khadi hone se beringia par chand hazaar maanav lagbhag 5,000 saalon tak anya maanvon se bina sampark ke himyug ke bhayankar prakope se bache rahe
 About 16,500 years ago, Himanias started melting and they entered North America
 lagbhag usee samay ke aasapaas beringia bhi pani main doobane laga or aaj se qareeb 6,000 varsh pehle tak taton ke rup vaise ho gaye jaise ki aadhunik yug main dekhe jate hai
 Berinjia was about 4,000 km long and 1,600 km wide
 yah aadhunik siberia kii lenaa nadi se lekar canada kii maikenzi nadi tak pahunchataa tha
 Its area was so large that according to some geologists it was less of a ground bridge and more of a subcontinent
 maimathon ke avasheshon kii haddiyon main maujuud colejan par anusandhan karke vaigyanikon ne yah mat diya he ki pashchimi beringia purvi beringia se zayaada shushk or thanda tha or isliye purvi beringia main praaniyon or paudhon kii adhik samruddhi or vividhta thi
 Berinjia was a large area and most of it was free from Himanias and many animals lived on its steppe-like area
 isliye kuch hazaar maanav bhi yahan rah paae
 It is believed that it lived in Berinjia for 5–17 thousand years and had no contact with other human societies
 kuch itihaaskaaron kaa sochna he ki ek jamaane main beringian maanvon kii pashanyugiya samskruti puure beringia main purv main siberia ke premorye kshetra se lekar pashchim main alaska tak or dakshin main hokkaido tak faili hui thi
 No remains of Berinjians have been found as this entire subcontinent is now submerged under the ocean

 It lived a hunter-gatherer biography and would live on average less than 40 years old
 garmiyon main badi taadaad main machhar or anya keet unhen pareshaan karte honge, jaisaa ki siberia main bhi dekha jaataa he
 When the weather changed and their terrain sank, the Berinjians were forced to migrate to North America, they would have had to learn to live afresh in America's separate ab-o-hawa
 2005 main hue ek anuvaanshiki anusandhan se sanket miltaa he ki shaayad 80 se bhi kam beringiaayiyon kaa vansh aadhunik kaal tak chal paaya he, yani anya sabhi kisi-na-kisi musiibat main padakar bina aage vansh chalaae hi khatm ho gaye
 Animals such as camel, mammoth, American lion, horse, deer, sheep, wolf and steppe buffalo were inhabited on Berinjia
 uttar america main hathi, baldaar ganda or singh ab vilupt hai lekin ve isi jamini pul ke zariye asia se vahaan pahunche
 It is also known from the study that the camel origin actually started in North America and the camel passed through Berinjia and reached other parts of Asia and the world
 itihaaskaar andaaza lagate hai ki beringia main maimath jaise bhimkaay jaanwaron ke bich rahakar beringian maanav unke shikaar main maahir ho gaye the
 Later, when it spread to Alaska and other parts of North America, there he continued to hunt these large animals on a large scale with his mastery

 Respiratory syncytial viruses are usually infected when people touch contaminated objects and then their eyes or nostrils
 anya virus janit sankraman tab hote hai jab vaayu main faili sandooshit maheen boonden munh yaa ankhon ke raste shwasan kar lee jaati hai
 Once it reaches the upper airways, the virus makes its way into the lungs, from where the airways, alveoli or lungs enter the cells associated with the pencima
 kuch virus jaise ki chechak yaa herpis cimplex rakt ke madhyam se fefdon tak pahunchate hai
 Cells of varying degrees may die due to lung invasion
 jab pratiraksha tantra is sankraman par pratikriya detaa he to fefdon ko or adhik kshati ho sakati he
 White blood cells, mainly single nuclear cells, primarily cause inflammation
 saath hi fefdon ko kshati bhi pahunchaati hai, bahut se virus isi samay anya angon ko prabhavit kar sakate hai or is prakaar anya shaareerik kriyaaon ko bhi baadhit karte hai
 Viruses make the body more susceptible to bacterial infections; In this way, bacterial pneumonia can lead to co-morbid conditions
 adhiktar bacteria gale yaa naak main rahane vaale jeevon ke pravesh se fefdon main shaamil ho jate hai
 Half of normal people have these small organisms enter during sleep
 jabaki gale main hameshaa bacteria hote hai, sankramak sambhaavnaaon vaale vahaan par keval kuch hi samay tak kuch vishesh paristhitiyon main rah pate hai
 a small amount of this type of bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Ligionella pneumophila, reaches the lungs through contaminated fine droplets circulating in the air
 bacteria rakt dwaara fail sakate hai
 Once they reach the lungs, bacteria can enter the space between the cells and the alveoli, where macrophages and neutrophils attempt to inactivate the bacteria
 neutrophil cytokine mukt karte hai jo pratiraksha tantra ko saamaanya rup se sakriy karata he
 This causes symptoms such as fever, chills, and fatigue caused by common bacterial pneumonia
 neutrophil, bacteria or aasapaas kii rakt vahikaaon se taral alvioli main bhar jaataa he jiske kaaran seene ke eks-re main samekan dikhataa he
 Pneumonia is usually diagnosed by a combination of physical signs and chest X-rays

 Under this agreement, the Dalit class was given the right to two votes in a separate electorate, considering the demand for political representation raised by Ambedkar
 iske antargat ek vot se dalit apana pratinidhi chun sakate the va duusari vot se saamaanya varg kaa pratinidhi chunane kii aazaadee thi
 Thus the Dalit representative was to be elected only by the vote of the Dalits

 But at the same time, the Dalit class could play its role by using its second vote, choosing the representative of the general class

 How many such people were born in India and went away
 ambedkar ne kaha ki gandhi kii jaan bachaane ke liye vah daliton ke hiton kaa tyaag nahin kar sakate
