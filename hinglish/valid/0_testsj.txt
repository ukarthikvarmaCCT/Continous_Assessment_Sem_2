 qutubuddin aibak madhya kaaleen bharat main ek shaasha, dilli sultanate kaa pehla sultan evam gulam vansh kaa sthaapak tha
 He ruled for only four years
 vah ek bahut hi pratibhashali sainik tha jo das banakar pehle gori samrajya ke sultan mohammad gori ke sainya abhiyaanon kaa sahaayak bana or phir dilli kaa sultan
 Qutub al-din was a resident of Turkistan and his parents were Turks

 The merchant then sold it to Qazi Fakhruddin Abdul Aziz Kufi of Nishapur
 abdul ajeez ne balak qutub ko apane putr ke saath sainya or dharmik prashikshan diya
 But after Abdul Aziz's death, his sons sold him again and he was eventually bought by Muhammad Ghori
 mohammad gori ne qutubuddin aibak ke saahas, kartavyanishtha tathaa swamibhakti se prabhavit hokar use shahi astabal kaa adhyaksh niyukt kar diya
 It was a respected position and he had the opportunity to participate in military operations

 Happy with this, Ghori appointed him as the Subedar of these areas

 First, in 1192, he suppressed rebellions in Ajmer and Meerut and rose to power in Delhi
 dilli ke paas indraprastha ko apana kendra banaakar usne bharat ke vijay kii niti apanaayi
 Earlier, the dominance and rule of any Muslim ruler over India did not last so long
 jat saradaaron ne haansi ke kile ko gher kar turk kiledaar malik nasiruddin ke liye sankat utpann kar diya tha par aibak ne jaaton ko parajeet kar haansi ke durg par punah adhikaar kar liya
 In 1194, he suppressed the second rebellion of Ajmer and supported his master in the battle of Sathachandavar of Jaichand, the ruler of Kannauj
 1195 isvi main usne koil ko jeet liya
 In 1196, the Medes of Ajmer organized a third rebellion in which Bhimdev, the ruler of Gujarat, had his hand

 All of them were experienced and qualified and were planning to inherit themselves
 gori ne aibak ko malik kii oopaadhi di thi par use sabhi saradaaron kaa pramukh banane kaa nirnay nahin liya tha
 Aibak's claim to the throne was weak but he worked efficiently under adverse conditions and eventually became the lord of Delhi's power
 gori kii mrityu ke baad 24 june 1206 ko qutubuddin kaa rajarohan hua par usne sultan kii oopaadhi dhaaran nahin kii
 The reason was that other slave chieftains Yaldauz and Kubacha were jealous of him
 unhone masood ko apane paksh main kar aibak ke liye visham paristhiti paidaa kar di thi
 Although the Turks trampled the region up to Bengal, their supremacy was doubtful
 rajput bhi vidroh karte rahete the par iske baavjood aibak ne in sabakaa datakar saamana kiya
 After the death of Bakhtiyar Khilji, Alimardan had declared independence and refused to assume ownership of Aibak

 aisa bachaav maanya nahin hota ki yuddhrat sarkaar kinwa uske kisi commander ke aadesh se kisi ne koi aparaadh kiya

 In such a situation, such work is not often taken in war crime

 The Nuremberg Court rejected the defense presented by the Natsi authorities - 'following the high command order' - for deliberately committing non-violent crimes, such as the elimination of Jews locked up in the gas chamber, civilian ruthless murder, etc
 The said defense cannot be considered for reducing the rigors of punishment

 On the same principle, in 1946, the US Military Commission punished the Japanese commander Yamashti for the excesses committed by the Japanese troops in the Philippine during the Second World War, although he said in his defense that he did not control his troops due to traffic disruption Could keep yadi vijit desh ke nivasee vijetaon se loha len to unki sthiti sainik jaisi nahin maani jaaygi
 But according to the tradition of international legislation, the enemy party has the right to punish them as 'war criminals'

 He foretells that the end of the celestial kingdom is certain, and after that there will be a dark era of thirty thousand years in which humans will have a great plight
 lekin vah yah bhi bhavishyavaanee karata he ki yadi kuch qadam uthaaye gaye to is andhkaar kaal ko keval ek hazaar saal tak simit rakhaa ja saktaa he, jiske baad ek doosraa samrajya uthegaa or suvyavastha laaegaa
 For this, it becomes two separate entities at the "two ends" of the galaxy

 Harry Soldan gives a spiritual speech which shows that the future can be told using mathematics
 samraat ke jasoos or gunde foran salden ke peeche lag jate hai jis se use or uski dorce vanbili naamak stri saathi ko chhupana padataa he
 Chatter Hamin, an assistant of Salden, hides them by moving them from place to place on the tractor
 salden ko apane nae ganit par khud adhik bharosa nahin he lekin chatter hammin usapar ise viksit karne par jor daalata he
 After getting introduced to different cultures located on this planet, Salden decides that by making them the basis material, psycho-history will be developed
 yah upanyaas "forvad da foundation" ke naam se chapa tha
 Eighty years have passed since, and Harry Soldan has developed his new psychology-history considerably
 uski khyaati bahut bad jaati he or use samraat ke mantri kaa ohada diya jaataa he
 In this book, Salden loses all his close associates, including his wife, Doors Vanbilli
 umr dhalane ke saath uskaa swasthya bhi karaab hone lagata he
 He instructs his granddaughter Vonda to start another institution
 "foundation" naamak upanyaas main harry salden par samrajya ke kilaaf deshadroh karne kaa muqaddama chalaaya ja rahaa he
 He says that his science is telling that the empire will fall and then either humans have to live in darkness for thirty thousand years or else, if all human knowledge is preserved in an "enlightened encyclopedia", then dark- Periods can be limited to only one thousand years
 harry salden se pind chhudaane ke liye use ek dur-daraaj ke terminus naamak grah par apana gyaanakosh banane ke liye ek sanstha banane kii anumati di jaati he
 Harry Saldon goes there with his enlightenment-workers
 saath-hi-saath vah chupchaap akashganga ke "dusre chor" par duusari sanstha bhi shuru kar detaa he
 On reaching the planet Terminus, the knowledge-workers fall into confusion
 unke ird-gird chaar shaktishaalee grah hai jo unhen daraate-dhamkaate hai
 Gyan Koshis have no means except their wisdom
 terminus kii rajdhani kaa mahayor, jiskaa naam salvedor hardin he, in grahon ko aapas main bhidaakar terminus kii swatantraaa banaae rakhane kii tarqeeb banataa he or isamen kaamyaab rahata he
 The empire gradually grows tired and scientific progress stops, while progress continues at the terminus
 terminus main bane upkaran samrajya main bane upkarnon se chote lekin adhik shaktishaalee hote hai, chaahe vah hathiyaar hon chaahe rozmarra ke istemaal kii chizein
 Terminus increases trade relations with the planets around them and finally gets control of them on the strength of its superior science
 terminus ke vyapaaree hi uski shakti ko failaane kaa kaam karte hai
 a businessman named Hobar Mallo becomes so powerful that he becomes the mayor of Terminus and spreads the power of the foundation to even more planets
 "foundation and almpaire" naamak upanyaas main samraat foundation ko ek khatare ke rup main dekhne lagata he
 He orders his army to attack him
 samraat kii sena shaktishaalee he, lekin ab foundation kaa vigyaan itnaa tarakkee kar chukaa he ki uski sena choti hone ke baavjood bhi vah samrajya ko haraa detaa he
 In the meantime, a man named "mule" emerges, whom Harry Soldan had never imagined
 isamen logon kii bhaawanaaon ko badalane kii adbhut shakti he or iske prayog se yah foundation ke bahari grahon par qabza karnaa shuru kar detaa he
 When a planet has to be conquered, first it goes there with its army and spreads fear among its citizens and then senses a sense of loyalty to itself
 chaar saadhaaran log - toran dairal, uski patni betaa dairal, publing miss or ek magniphiko naam kaa sadakchhaap masakara - milakar duusari sanstha ko khojane lagate hai
 He hopes that the mule can be defeated with the help of another institution because it is said that the emphasis of the second institution was on exposing the mental powers
 yah chaar log kisi tarah samrajya kii rajdhani, trenter, ke mukhya pustkaalay main jaakar duusari santhaan ke ate-pate kii chaanbin karne lagate hai
 At first, Abling Miss understands that it has been said, but as soon as it starts telling the three of them where it is located, the son shoots a gun at him and kills him
 phir vah yah ghoshnaa karti he ki use publing miss ko maarane kaa khed he lekin vah samaj gai he ki magniphiko hi khachchar he or vah bhi duusari sanstha ko khoj rahaa he
 If the abling miss had given her address, the mule would have also known and attacked her
 magniphiko qabool kar letaa he ki vahi khachchar he
 Torna Darrell and son Darrel leave, he goes away and tries to find another institution on his own
 "duusari sanstha" naam ke upanyaas main khachchar duusari sanstha ko dhund nikaalane ke qareeb aa pahunchaa he
 People from other organizations come out to deal with him and it is known that he is the most intelligent man in the entire galaxy
 yahan pehali sanstha duniyaadaari kii chizon par jor lagaati he vahaan duusari sanstha buddhi ke vikaas par jor detii he
 With the help of its most intelligent people, another organization overcomes the mule
 uski aakraamak maansikta ko badalakar ek shantipriy maansikta di jaati he
 Leaving the idea of defeating another entity, he returns to rule his planets peacefully
 duusari sanstha kii shaktiyon ko dekhakar pehali sanstha ko bahut jalan hoti he
 She is determined to destroy him
 vah unhen dhund nikaalane kii bahut koshish karte hai kyonki harry salden ke kathan kii vah "akashganga ke dusre chor par he" kaa thik matlab nikaal paanaa kathin he
 Then they find that the galaxy is round, so the other end will be at the terminus, running from the terminus
 vah ek yantra kaa nirmaan karte hai jis se duusari sanstha ke teevrbuddhiyon ko atyant dard hota he
 With his use, he gains a group of 50 sharpshooters who are killed
 pehali sanstha ke log kush ho jate hai ki unhone duusari sanstha ko khatm kar diya
 In fact, the other organization has given martyrdom of 50 people for its rescue and remains intact
 "foundation kaa kinaaraa" naam ke upanyaas main foundation ke mahayor harala brano ko shaq hone lagata he ki duusari sanstha vastav main khatm nahin hui thi
 She dispatches a military officer named Golan Treviz, a scholar named Yanov Pelorat, and other companions on a search for another institution
 palorat se baatcheet karne par trevies ko lagane lagata he ki duusari sanstha prithvi naamak grah par he
 It is told in the book that people have almost forgotten the earth and many people understand that there is no such planet
 kisi bhi gyaanakosh main prithvi shaamil nahin he or uskaa zikr keval mithy-kathaon main miltaa
 Treviz feels that the earth is being deliberately hidden
 isi dauraan duusari sanstha ke grah par store gandibal naam ke pramukh shahari ko ek saadhaaran vyakti miltaa he jisaki buddhi main kuch parivartan kiye jane ke halake chihn hai
 This change has been done so cleanly that it is beyond the capacity of another institution
 gandibal samaj jaataa he ki akashganga main koi vyakti yaa taaqat aisi he jo duusari sanstha ke liye baari pad sakati he
 He was already castigated on Trevize because Treviz often spoke against another institution
 ab vah trevies kaa peechha karne kaa faisla karata he kyonki use lagata he ki duusari sanstha ko khojate-khojate trevies zarur is nayi chuphi hui taaqat ko bhi dhund nikaalega
 In their quest, Treviz and Palaurat find a planet named Gaia, on which resounding people reside
 yahan sab praani or vastuen ek dusre se chetana or buddhi jode hue hai
 Chasing them, Branno and Gendible also reach there separately
 gaaya par trevies ko maanav ke bhavishya ke liye teen raston main se ek ko chunane par majaboor kiya jaataa he: pehali sanstha kii vijay or uski vyavastha par aadhaarit samrajya, duusari sanstha kii vijay or usapar aadhaarit buddhi-niyantran ke dwaara chalaaya jane vaala samrajya, yaa phir puri akashganga kii buddhiyon ko gaaya se jodakar ek vishaal akashgangeey chetana kaa janm
 Trevise chooses the third Rasta
 uske chunaav ke baad, gaaya kii vishaal chetana brano kii buddhi main parivartan kar detii he jis se brano samajhane lagati he ki pehali sanstha vijayi he
 Gendible is also changed so that the other institution is victorious and returns to its planet
 trevies ko swayan bhi thik se pataa nahin hota kii usne gaaya ko kyon chunaa
 At the beginning of the novel titled "foundation and Earth", Trevi's is exploring Earth
 uske saath palorat he or ek gaaya kii nivasee blissnobiarlla bhi hai
 Treviz finds addresses for three locations in the galaxy, but his vehicle's computer does not know of any planet located there
 pehle sthaan par use orora naamak grah miltaa he jahaan khandhar to hai lekin koi manushya nahin
 At another place, a planet named Malpomania is found
 yahan koi manushya nahin he or iskaa mausam bahut bighad chukaa he
 Here, there is only one moss living with carbon dioxide which immediately spreads on their vehicle
 kisi tarah us kaai ko khatm karke vah tisare sthaan par jate hai jahaan unke solaria naam kaa grah miltaa he
 There lives a small community of sharpies
 jab inamen se ek trevies or uske saathiyon ke liye khatara ban jaataa he to bliss gaaya kii shaktiyon ke istemaal se use maar daalati he
 Then it is known that a child has been orphaned by its death, which will also be killed by convention
 trevies or uske saathi bachche ko saath lekar solaria se batch nikalate hai

 The principles propounded in the Upanishads are so conflicting and scattered that it is difficult to draw a philosophical view of a type from them
 vedant sutara 'samanvay' ke siddhant kaa sahaara lekar upanishdon main ek darshanik drushti kaa pratipaadan karata he
 But these formulas themselves are so brief that it is difficult to extract meaning from them without interpretation
 inaki sankshiptata ke kaaran inpar kai vyakhyaayein likhi gai jo paraspar virdohi drushti se vedant kaa pratipaadan karti he
 All the departures of Vedanta consider these sutras as their proof

 jo mukhya rup se dakshin asia ke uttar-pashchimi kshetron main, jo aaj tak uttar purv afghanistan ,pakistan ke uttar-pashchim or uttar bharat main faili he
 Along with the ancient civilizations of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of the three earliest chronologies of the civilizations of the ancient world, and of these three, the most widespread and most discussed
 sammanit patrika nechar main prakashit shodh ke anusaar yah sabhyataa kam se kam 8000 varsh puraani he
 It is also known as the Harappan civilization and the 'indus-saraswati civilization'
 iskaa vikaas sindhu or ghaghghar / hakadaa ke kinare hua
 Mohenjodaro, Kalibanga, Lothal, Dholavira, Rakhigarhi and Harappa were its major centers
 disambar 2014 main bhirdana ko sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa ab tak kaa khoja gaya sabase pracheen nagar mana gaya he
 Archaeologists and historians based on the excavations in the British period have estimated that it was a highly developed civilization and these cities have been inhabited and destroyed many times

 In 1856 Cunningham surveyed about this civilization
 1856 main karachi se lahore ke madhya railway line ke nirmaan ke dauraan bartan bandhuon dwaara hadappa sthal kii soochna sarkaar ko di
 In this sequence, in 1861, under the direction of Alexander Cunningham, the Archaeological Department of India was established

 Fleet wrote an article about this old civilization
 1921 main dayaram saahani ne hadappa kaa utkhanan kiya
 Thus this civilization was named Harappan civilization and Dayaram Sahni was considered its explorer
 yah sabhyataa sindhu nadi ghati main faili hui thi isliye iskaa naam sindhu ghati sabhyataa rakhaa gaya
 Due to the rise of cities for the first time, it is also called the first urbanization
 pratham baar kaansya ke prayog ke kaaran ise kaansya sabhyataa bhi kaha jaataa he
 1400 centers of Indus Valley Civilization have been discovered, of which 925 centers are in India
 80 pratishat sthal saraswati nadi or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke aas-paas he
 So far only 3 percent of the total discoveries have been excavated
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa kshetra atyant vyapak tha
 Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro have provided evidence of this civilization
 atah vidwaanon ne ise sindhu ghati kii sabhyataa kaa naam diya, kyonki yah kshetra sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra main aate hai, par baad main ropar, lothal, kalibanga, vanamali, rangapore aadi kshetron main bhi is sabhyataa ke avshesh mili jo sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra se baahar the
 Therefore, many historians consider it more appropriate to name this civilization as "harappan civilization", being the main center of this civilization
 bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag ke mahanideshak jon marshall ne 1924 main sindhu sabhyataa ke bare main teen mahatvapurn granth likhe
 The area of this civilization was many times larger and larger than the area of all ancient civilizations of the world

 Subsequently, it expanded in the south and east direction
 is prakaar hadappa samskruti ke antargat punjab, sindh or baluchistan ke bhaag hi nahin, balki gujarat, rajasthan, haryana or pashchimi uttar pradesh ke seemaant bhaag bhi the
 Its spread ranged from Rahmandheri in the north to Daimabad in the south and Sutkagandor of Makran beach in Balochistan in the west to Meerut and Kurukshetra in the northeast
 praarambhik vistaar jo praapt tha usamen sampoorn kshetra tribhujaakar tha is tarah yah kshetra aadhunik pakistan se to bada he hi, pracheen misr or mesopotamia se bhi bada he
 In the third and second millennium BC, the area of any civilization throughout the world was not larger than the Harappan culture
 ab tak bhartiya upmahadweep main is samskruti ke kul 1000sthalon kaa pataa chal chukaa he
 Some of these are in the initial stage, some are in the mature stage and some are in the later stage

 The specialty of these two is to be a city fortress
 uttar hadappa avasthaa gujarat ke kathiyawad prayadweep main rangpur or rosedi sthalon par bhi pai gai he
 Charles Mann first came to know of this civilization in 1826
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke pramukh shahar teen deshon main is prakaar he:- The various cities of India have the following cities of the Indus Valley Civilization: - is sabhyataa kii sabase vishesh baat thi yahaan kii viksit nagar nirmaan yojana
 Both Harappa and Mohan Joddo had their fortifications where the family of the ruling class lived
 prayek nagar main durg ke baahar ek usase nimna str kaa shahar tha jahaan eenton ke makaanon main saamaanya log rahete the
 The special thing about these city buildings was that they were configured like traps
 yani sadake ek duusare ko samakon par katati thim or nagar anek ytaakar khandon main vibhakt ho jaataa tha
 This was applicable to all Indus settlements whether they were small or big
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado ke bhawan bade hote the
 The monuments there are proof that the rulers there were the ultimate skilled in labor mobilization and tax collection
 eenton kii badi-badi imaarat dekh kar saamaanya logon ko bhi yah lagegaa ki ye shaasha kitne pratapi or pratishthavan the
 By far the most famous site of Mohan Jodaro is the huge public bath, whose reservoir is in the mound of the fort
 yah into ke sthapaty kaa ek sundar udhaaharan he
 It is 11
88 meters long, 7
01 meters wide and 2
43 meters deep
 dono siron par tal tak jane kii seedhiyaan lagi hai
 There are change rooms next to the clothes
 snanagar kaa farsh paki eenton kaa bana he
 There is a big well in the nearby room whose water was taken out and put in hose
 hauz ke kone main ek nirgam he jisase pani bahakar naale main jaataa tha
 It is believed that this huge bath will be built for the religious bath which has traditionally been necessary for religious work in India
 mohan jodado kii sabase bada sanrachana he - anaaj rakhane kaa kothaar, jo 45
71 meter lanbaa or 15
23 meter chaudaa he
 Six rooms have been found in the fort of Harappa, which stand in two rows on a platform of bricks
 har ek kothaar 15
23 me
 lanbaa tathaa 6
09 me
 chaudaa he or nadi ke kinare se kuch ek meter kii duuri par he
 The floor area of these twelve units is about 838
125 square meters
 Which is almost as much as that of Mohan Jodro's storeroom
 hadappa ke kothaaron ke dakshin main khulaa farsh he or isapar do kataron main eent ke vrittakar chabutare bane hue hai
 Wheat and barley grains have been found in the cracks of the floor
 isse prathit hota he ki in chabutaron par fasal kii dawni hoti thi
 Two-room barracks have also been found in Harappa which were probably meant for laborers to live
 kalibangan main bhi nagar ke dakshin bhaag main eenton ke chabutare bane hai jo shaayad kothaaron ke liye bane honge
 Thus it is clear that Kothar was an integral part of the Harappan culture
 hadappa samskruti ke nagaron main eent kaa istemaal ek vishesh baat he, kyonki isi samay ke misr ke bhawanon main dhoop main sukhi eent kaa hi prayog hua tha
 The use of concrete bricks is found in contemporary Mesopatamia, but not on such a scale as in the Indus Valley Civilization
 mohan jodado kii jal nikaas pranali adbhut thi
 Almost every big or small house in every city had a courtyard and bath
 kalibangan ke anek gharon main apane-apane kuen the
 The water of the houses flowed to the streets where peacocks were made under them
 aksar ye moriyaan eenton or pathar kii silliyon se dhakin hoti thim
 In these peacocks of roads, softeners were also made
 sadakon or moriyon ke avshesh banaavali main bhi mili hai
 The economy of the Indus civilization was agrarian, but trade and animal husbandry were also in vogue
 aaj ke mukaable sindhu pradesh purv main bahut upjau tha
 In the fourth century BC, a historian of Sikandar said that Sindh was counted in the fertile regions of this country
 purv kaal main prakritik vanaspati bahut thim jiske kaaran yahaan acchhee varsha hoti thi
 The wood was used extensively for cooking bricks and building from the forests here, due to which the expansion of forests was gradually reduced
 sindhu kii urvartaa kaa ek kaaran sindhu nadi se prativarsh aane vaali baadh bhi thi
 a paved brick wall to protect the village indicates that floods used to come every year
 yahaan ke log baadh ke utar jane ke baad november ke maheene main baadh vaale maidaanon main beej bo dete the or agali baadh ke aane se pehle april ke maheene main gehun or jau kii fasal kaat lete the
 No shovel or fall has been found here, but from the prakrit-harappan civilization of Kalibangan, we have the impression that plows were plowed in Rajasthan during this period
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log genhu, jau, rai, matar, jowar aadi anaaj paidaa karte the
 They produced two varieties of wheat
 banaavali main mila jau unnat kism kaa he
 Apart from this, they also produced sesame and mustard
 sabase pehle kapaas bhi yaheen paidaa kii gai
 In the name of this, the people of Greece started saying this sign
 hadappa yonto ek krishi pradhan samskruti thi par yahaan ke log pashupaalan bhi karte the
 Bull-cow, buffalo, goat, sheep and boar were reared
 harappai logon ko hathi tathaa gande kaa gyaan tha
 Many businesses were prevalent in the cities here

 It was also exported abroad
 johari kaa kaam bhi unnat avasthaa main tha
 The work of making bead and amulets was also popular, yet no iron item has been found
 atah siddh hota he ki inhen lohe kaa gyaan nahin tha
 People here used to trade stones, metal scales etc
 among themselves
 ek bade bhubhag main dher sari sil, ekarup lipi or manakikrut maap taul ke pramaan mili hai
 He was familiar with the wheel and probably used a vehicle similar to today's aces
 ye afghanistan or iran se vyapaar karte the
 They established a commercial colony in northern Afghanistan that facilitated trade
 bahut si harappai sil mesopotamia main mili hai jinase lagata he ki mesopotamia se bhi unka vyapaar sambandh tha
 Evidences of trade with Meluha have been found in the records of Mesopotamia, as well as two intermediate trade centers - Dalmun and Maken
 dilamun kii pahchaan shaayad faras kii khadi ke bahrain ke kii ja sakati he
 It is clear that Harappa's developed city building system, the existence of large public baths and the trade relations with foreign countries would not have happened without any big political power, but there is no concrete evidence of how the rulers here were and what was the form of governance
 
 lekin nagar vyavastha ko dekhakar lagata he ki koi nagar nigam jaisi sthaneey swashaasan vaali sanstha thi
 Female statues of burnt clay have been found in Harappa in large numbers
 ek murti main stri ke garbh se nikalataa ek paudha dikhaaya gaya he
 According to scholars, it is a statue of the earth goddess and it must have been closely related to the birth and growth of plants
 isliye maaloom hota he ki yahaan ke log dharti ko urvartaa kii devi samajhate the or isaki puja usee tarah karte the jis tarah misr ke log nil nadi kii devi isis kii
 But like ancient Egypt, it is difficult to say whether the society here was also mother-dominated
 kuch vaidic sookhton main prithvi mata kii stuti he, dholavira ke durg main ek kuan mila he isamen neeche kii taraf jaati seedhiyaan he or usamen ek khidki thi jaha deepak jalaane ke saboot milte he
 The water of Saraswati river used to come in that well, so perhaps the people of Indus Valley used to worship Saraswati through that well
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nagaron main ek sil paaya jaataa he jisamen ek yogi kaa chitra he 3 yaa 4 mukh vaala, kai vidwaan maanate he ki yah yogi shiv he
 Mewar, which was once in the range of Indus Valley Civilization, is still worshiped here, Eklinganath ji, the incarnation of Shiva with four faces
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log apane shavon ko jalaayaa karte the, mohan jodado or hadappa jaise nagaron kii aabaadi kareeb 50 hazaar thi par phir bhi vahaan se keval 100 ke aasapaas hi kabre mili he jo is baat kii or ishaara karata he ve shav jalaate the
 Havan blunts have been found at Lothal, Kalibanga etc
, which is a proof of their being Vedic
 yahan swaastik ke chitra bhi mili he
 Some scholars believe that Hinduism was the original religion of Dravida and that Shiva was the god of Dravida whom the Aryans adopted
 kuch jain or buddha vidwaan yah bhi maanate he ki sindhu ghati sabhyataa jain yaa buddha dharm ke the, par mukhyadhara ke itihaaskaaron ne yah baat nakaar di or iske adhik pramaan bhi nahin he
 Archaeologists have found the remains of many temples in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia but no temple has been found in the Indus Valley till date, Marshall etc
 Many historians believe that the people of Indus Valley used to worship in their homes, fields or river banks, but Till date, only the Brihatnasan or the huge bathhouse is such a monument which is considered a place of worship
 jaise aaj hindu ganga main nahaane jate he vaise hi saindhav log yahan nahaakar pavitra hua karte the

 There is a feeling that this civilization was in its last phase decadent
 is samay makaanon main puraani eenton ke prayog kii jaankaree milti he
 Scholars do not agree on the reasons for its destruction
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke avsaan ke peeche vibhinn tark diye jate hai jaise: akraman, jalwaayu parivartan evam paristhitik asantulan, barh tathaa bhu-tathvik parivartan, mahamari, aarthik kaaran
 It seems that there was not a single reason for the decline of this civilization, but because of a combination of different reasons

 The city and drainage system in Mohenjo Daro seems less likely to have an epidemic

 ek lambii vikaas prakriya ke baad 2006 me windos vista kii wolum licencing hui or 2007 main ise upabhoktaaon ke liye jari kiya gaya tha
 It added a lot of new features, and was also available in many different versions, but it faced criticism in many cases, including its weak performance capability, the use of new uacs, and its stringent licensing agreements

 VAT, unlike sales tax, is neutral with respect to the number of routes between the producer and the end consumer; Where sales tax is levied on the total price at each stage, the result is a step
 waite ek apratyaksh kar he, is rup main ki kar ko aise kisi se ekatra kiya jaataa he jo kar kaa puraa kharch nahin uthaata
 Maurice Louré, the joint director of the French tax authority, Direction générale des impôts was the first to introduce VAT on 10 April 1954, although the concept was proposed in 1918 by German industrialist Dr
 Wilhelm von Siemens
 shuru main bade paimaane ke kaarobaaron par lakshyit, samay ke saath sabhi vyavsaayik kshetron ko shaamil karne ke liye iskaa vistaar kiya gaya
 In France, it is the most important source of finance for the country, contributing 52% of the country's revenue
 utpaadon or sevaaon ke nijee antim upabhokta, kharid par waite ko vasuul nahin sakate, lekin udyog un maal or sevaaon par jinhen ve aage kii aapurti yaa seva pradaan karne ke liye kharidte hai, jise sidhe yaa paroksh rup se antim upyogkarta ko bechaa jayega, waite ko vasuul sakate hai
 In this way, the total tax levied at each level in the economic chain of supply is a constant fraction of the value that a business adds to its products and much of the cost of tax collection is borne by the business rather than the state
 waite kaa avishkaar isliye kiya gaya kyonki bahut adhik bikri karon or shulkon ne dhokhadhadi or taskari ko protsaahit kiya
 Critics say this leads to an inconsistent tax burden on middle-class and low-income households
 mulya yojit kar, utpaadan ke har charan main yojit mulya par kar laga kar bikri kar ke sopan asar se bachaata he
 Value-added taxation is being preferred worldwide instead of the traditional sales tax
 siddhant rup main, mulya yojit kar un sabhi vanijyik gatividhiyon par lagu hote hai jisamen maal kaa utpaadan or vitaran tathaa sevaaon kaa praavdhaan shaamil hota he
 In each transaction of a business, VAT is evaluated and collected on the value added to the goods

 In many developing countries like India, sales tax / VAT is an important revenue source as high unemployment and low per capita income make other income sources inadequate
 haalanki, kai up-rashtriya sarkaron dwaara iskaa virodh hota he chunki isse unke dwaara ekatrit kul rajasav sangrah main kami hoti he saath hi saath swaittata kaa kuch nuksaan bhi hota he
 Sales taxes are usually levied only on final sales to consumers: because of reimbursement, VAT has the same overall economic impact on final prices
 mukhya antar, sirf atirikt lekhankan kaa he jise un logon dwaara karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo aapurti shrinkhalaa ke bich main aate hai, waite kii is kami ko, utpaadan shrinkhalaa ke prayek sadsy par, unki or graahakon kii is shrinkhalaa main sthiti ko dhyaan naa dekar or unki sthiti kii jaanch karne or pramanit karne ke prayaas ko khatm kar, samaan kar ke prayog dwaara santulit kiya jaataa he
 When there is some exemption in the VAT system, if any, as with GST in New Zealand, it becomes even easier to pay VAT
 ek saamaanya aarthik vichaar yah he ki yadi bikri kar 10% se adhik ho jaataa he to log bade paimaane par karapavanchan gatividhiyon main lipt ho jate hai 
 The total VAT rate, on the other hand, may exceed 10% without extensive evasion due to innovative collection systems
 tathaapi, kyonki apane sangrah kii vishesh vyavastha ke kaaran, waite kaaphi aasaani se vishisht dhokhadhadi kaa nishaanaa ban jaati he jaise carozal frod jo rajyon ke liye kar aamadani main kami ke maamle main bahut mahangaa ho saktaa he
 The standard method for applying VAT is the principle that a business retains a percentage of the product minus the price previously paid
 yadi waite dar 10% he, to ek santare kaa ras nirmaataa prati galen keemat £5 ke 10% ko santare ke kisaan dwaara purv main bhugtan kiye gaye kar se gata kar degaa 
 In this example, the orange juice producer would have a £ 0
30 tax liability

 Behind this simple principle are variations in its implementation, as discussed in the next section
 sangrah kii paddati se, waite lekha aadhaarit yaa bijak aadhaarit ho saktaa he
 Under the invoice method of collection, each seller imposes a VAT rate on their product and gives the buyer a special invoice indicating the amount of tax levied
 kharidaar jo apni bikri par waite ke daayre main hai, in bijkon kaa prayog waite kii apni dendaree ke prati ek credit praapt karne ke liye karte hai
 The difference between the tax shown on the invoice passed and the invoice received is then passed on to the government
 lekha aadhaarit tareeke main, aisa koi vishesh bijak prayog nahin kiya jaataa he
 Instead, the tax is calculated at the value added, which is measured as a difference between revenue and allowable purchases
 adhikansh deshon main aaj bijak vidhi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, ekmaatr apwaad he japan jahaan lekha paddati kaa upyog karata he
 By the time of collection, VAT can be either accrual or cash based
 nakad aadhaarit lekhankan, lekhankan kaa ek bahut hi saral rup he
 When a payment is received for the sale of an item or service, an accumulation is made and the revenue is recorded at the date of receipt of the funds - no matter when the sale was made
 check tab likhe jate hai jab bill dene ke liye dhan uplabdh ho or vyay ko check kii taarikh main darj kiya jaataa he - isaki bina parvaah kiye ki kharch kab kiya gaya
 The primary focus is on the amount of cash in the bank and the secondary focus is on ensuring that all bills have been paid
 rajasav ko us samay avadhi ke saath jab unhen arjeet kiya gaya, tulana karne main adhik prayaas nahin kiya jaataa, yaa kharchon ko us avadhi se milan karne main jab unhen vyay kiya gaya
 Accrual based accounting matches the revenue from the period when they were earned and the expenses for the period when they were incurred
 haalanki yah nakadi aadhaarit lekhankan se zyada jatil he, yah aapke vyavsaay ke bare main adhik jaankaree pradaan karata he
 The accrual basis enables you to track receivables and payables
 prodbhavan aadhaar aapako unhen kamaane main kiye gaye vyay ke liye rajasav ke milan main madad karata he, aapako or adhik sarthak vittiya report detaa he
 Consider the manufacture and sale of any item, which we would call a widget in this case
 ek 10% bikri kar ke saath: Hence the consumer paid 10% extra as compared to the zero tax scheme and the government collected this amount
 khudara vikreta ne tex main sidhe kuch nahin khoyaa or khudara vikritaon ko atirikt kagaji karrwai kerani hoti he taaki unke dwaara ikattha kiye gaye bikri kar ko sahi dhang se sarkaar tak pahunchaaya ja sake
 Suppliers and manufacturers have the administrative burden of supplying the right certificate and checking that their customers are not consumers
 10% waite ke saath: That is, the consumer paid 10% extra as compared to the zero tax scheme and the government collected this amount in taxation
 kaarobaar ne kar main sidhe kuch nahin khoyaa
 They do not require a request for a certificate from buyers who are not end users, but they will have to do additional accounting so that they can correctly differentiate between the government, what they collected from VAT and what they spent in VAT
 Can give dhyaan den ki prayek maamle main pradutt waite, laabh yaa yojit mulya ke 10% ke baraabar he
 The advantage of the VAT system over the sales tax system is that the industry cannot hide consumption, proving that it is not a consumer
 uparokt udhaaharan main, hamane mana ki kar kii shuruuaat se pehle or baad main vijet kii utani hi sankhya main nirmaan hua or bikri hui
 This is not true in real life
 aapurti or maang ke mul tatv sujhaate hai ki koi bhi kar kisi ke liye lenden kii keemat ko badha detaa he, chaahe vah kreta ho yaa vikreta
 keemat main badhotaree se yaa to maang vakr baayi taraf jaataa he, yaa aapurti vakr upar kii taraf
 donon hi kaaryaatmak rup se baraabar hai
 As a result, the quantity of goods purchased decreases and / or the price it is sold increases
 upar ke udhaaharan main aapurti or maang kaa yah badlaav shaamil nahin he, saralata ke liye or kyonki ye prabhaav har prakaar kii vastu ke liye bhinn hai
 The above example assumes that the tax is non-distortable
 baaki sabhi karon kii tarah, ek waite, iske bina hota, ise viroopit karata he
 Because the price for someone increases, the quantity of goods decreases
 tadnusaar, kuch log adhik dwaara badtar ho jate hai jahaan sarkaar kar kii aay se behatar ho jaati he
 That is, the supply and demand change leads to a far greater loss than the tax benefits
 ise dedwet haani ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Income lost by the economy is higher than government income; Tax is disabled
 sarkaar kii aay kii puri raashi ho saktaa he ek dedwet draig naa ho, agar kar rajasav ko laabhadaayak kharch ke liye istemaal kiya jaay yaa sakaaratmak bahyata ho - duusare shabdon main, sarkarein bas kar aay kaa upbhog karne kii bajaay kahin adhik kuch kar saktin hai
 While distortions occur, consumption taxes, such as VAT, are often considered better because they distort incentives to investment, saving and working less than most other forms of taxation - in other words, rather than producing a VAT Discourages consumption
 upar chitra main, The "value added tax" has been criticized since its burden depends on consumers of personal end products and is therefore a regressive tax, although it should be understood that all company taxes ultimately arrive as a tax on consumers
 bachaav pakshon kaa daawa he ki aay ke madhyam se karadhaan ko nikaal dena ek manamaana maanak he or mulya yojit kar vastav main ek anupatik kar he or isamen adhik aamadani vaale log adhik bhugtan karte hai usee dar par jis par ve khapat adhik karte hai
 Both measurements make VAT more regressive than making it a progressive income tax
 ek waite pranali kaa prabhavi pratigaami gun, bad bhi saktaa he kyonki maal ke vibhinn virgon par alag-alag daron se kar lagaae jate hai
 Therefore VAT is mostly a flat tax and in practice can be regressive
 ek mulya yojit kar se praapt rajasav aksar apeksha se kam hote hai kyonki ve kathin hai or unka prabandhan or sangrah karnaa mahangaa hota he
 In many countries, where collection of personal income tax and corporate profit tax has historically been weak, VAT collection has been more successful than other taxes
 waite kai kshetradhikaron main or adhik mahatvapurn ho gaya he chunki vyapaar udaarikaran ke kaaran tarriff str duniya bhar main gira he or anivaary rup se waite ne khoye hue tarriff rajasav ko pratisthapit kiya he
 The distortion of cost and value-added tax is less than the high import duty of economic inefficiencies and enforcement issues, it is disputed, but by principle value-added taxes are far more effective
 kuch udyogon main waite kaa adhik parihaar paaya jaataa he, vishesh rup se jahaan nakad lenden prabal hota he or ise badhaava dene ke liye waite kii aalochana kii ja sakati he
 From the government's point of view, however, VAT may be better because it can hold at least some value additions
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek badhai nakadi ke liye ek grihaswami ko, jo aamtaur par ek input waite kaa waapas daawa nahin kar saktaa, sevaayen uplabdh kara saktaa he 
 Therefore the homeowner will incur lower costs and the carpenter may avoid other taxes
 sarkaar ko, tathaapi, abhi bhi kai anya input ke liye jo badhai ko bechaa gaya he waite praapt hoga or badhai in input par waite ko punah praapt karne main asamarth hoga
 While the total income will be lower than that of full compliance, it will not be less than the income under the other probable taxation system

 The national VAT law of each member country must comply with the provisions of the EU VAT law described in Directive 2006 / 112 / EC
 yah directive EU waite ke buniyadi dhaanche ko spasht karata he, par sadsy deshon ko waite kanoon ke kriyanvayan main thode lacheelepan kii anumati detaa he
 For example, in different member states of the European Union, different rates of VAT have been allowed
 lekin nirdesh 2006 / 112 ke anusaar sadsy deshon main waite kii maanak dar kam se kam 15% honi chahie or ek yaa do ghatit daren 5% se kam nahin honi chahie
 In some Member States, there is a 0% VAT rate on certain supplies - these Member States may have accepted this as part of the EU Assessment Treaty

 VAT that is levied by a business and paid by its customers is called "output VAT"
 praapt aapurtiyon par ek vyavsaay dwaara anya vyavsaayon ko diya jane vaala waite "input waite" kehalaata he, 
 Typically an industry can recover input VAT to the extent that the input VAT can be declined at its taxable output
 input waite ko output waite ke vipareet sthapit karke vasula jaataa he jiske liye vyavsaay kaa sarkaar ke khate main hona aavashyaktaa he, yaa, agar vahaan ek aadhiky he, to sarkaar se ek chukauti kaa daawa karte hue
 According to the VAT Directive, some goods and services should be exempt from VAT and some other goods and services should be exempt from VAT but the option of VAT on those supplies should be subject to an EU member state

 The standard rate of VAT in Finland is 22%, but in July 2010 it will be increased by one percent to 23%, with all other VAT rates, except the zero rate
 Additionally, two reduced rates are in use: 17%, which is applicable to food and animal food and 8% which is the entry fee for passenger transport services, cinema performances, physical exercise services, books, pharmaceuticals, vocational, cultural and entertainment programs and Apply to facilities

 On the other hand, the introduction of VAT would result in a revenue deficit for states and a reduction in their autonomy with greater centralization
 " chanchal kumaar sharma jor dekar kehete hai: "raajnneetik majaburiyon ne sarkaar ko waite kaa ek asangat model pesh karne ke liye prerit kiya" 'bhartiya waite pranali apurna' he, is had tak ki yah 'waite ke mul siddhanton ke khilaaf jaati he'
