 The French Revolution was a period of political and social upheaval and radical changes in the history of France that lasted from 1789 to 1799
 baad main, nepolian bonapart ne francisi samrajya ke vistaar dwaara kuch ansh tak is kranti ko aage badhaayaa
 As a result of the revolution, the king was removed from the throne, a republic was established, bloody conflicts took place, and finally the dictatorship of Napoleon was established, which spread many values of this revolution in and outside Western Europe
 is kranti ne aadhunik itihaas kii disha badal di
 This led to the decline of the absolute monarchy around the world, new republics and liberal democracies
 aadhunik yug main jin mahaparivartanon ne paashchaatya sabhyataa ko hilaa diya usamen france kii rajyakranti sarvaadhik naatakeey or jatil sabit hui
 This revolution disrupted the life of not only France but the whole of Europe

 This revolution also led to freedom in other European countries and other countries also started fighting for freedom from the monarchy
 isane europea rashtron sahit asian deshon main rajshahi or nirankushta ke khilaaf vaataavaran taiyaar kiya
 France had an autocratic monarchy based on the divine principle of kingship
 isamen raja ko aseemit adhikaar praapt the or raja swechhachari tha
 In the reign of Louis the 14th, autocracy was at its zenith
 usne kaha- "main hi rajya hoon"
 He made laws against his will
 usne shakti kaa atyadhik kendriyakaran rajtantr ke paksh main kar diya
 France expanded by diplomacy and military prowess
 is tarah usne rajtantr ko gambhir pesha banaaya
 The governance that Louis 14th centralized required a worthy king, but his successors Louis 15th and Louis 16th were completely inept
 lui 15waan atyant vilaasi, adoordarshee or niskriy shaasha tha
 Participated in Austria's succession war and the Seven Year War caused great damage to the country's economic condition
 iske baavjood bhi varsay kaa mahal vilasita kaa kendra bana rahaa

 He was an indolent and unworthy ruler
 usne bhi swechhachaarit or nirankushta kaa pradarshan kiya
 He said that "this thing is legal because i want it
" " apane ek mantri ke tyaagptr ke samay usne kaha ki-kaash! main bhi tyaagptr de paata
 His wife Mary Antoniet had a great influence on him
 vah phijulkharchi karti thi
 He had no understanding of the troubles of the common man
 ek baar jab logon kaa juluus roti kii maang kar rahaa tha to usne salaah di ki yadi roti uplabdh nahin he to log kek kyon nahin khate
 In this way the governance system of the country was completely dependent on bureaucracy
 jo vanshanugat thi
 There were no rules for their recruitment and training and there was no institution that could control these bureaucrats
 is tarah shashan pranali puri tarah bhrasht, nirankush, niskriy or shoshankari thi
 The law of personal law and the will of the king applied
 faltah desh main ek samaan kanoon samhita kaa abhaav tathaa vibhinn kshetron main vibhinn kanoonon kaa prachlan tha
 Due to this chaotic and complicated law, the public did not have knowledge of their own law
 is avyavasthit nirankush tathaa samvedansheel shashan tantra kaa astitv janata ke liye kshtdaayi ban gaya
 These oppressive political circumstances gave way to revolution
 france kii arajakpurna sthiti ke baaren main you kaha ja saktaa he ki "buree vyavastha kaa to koi prashn nahin, koi vyavastha hi nahin thi
 " kranti ke kaarnon ko saamaajik paristhitiyon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 French society was heterogeneous and disintegrated
 vah samaaj teen virgon / stats main vibhakt tha
 The clergy in the first states, the nobility in the second states and the general public in the third states
 padri evam kuleen varg ko vyapak visheshadhikaar praapt tha jabaki jansadharan adhikaar viheen tha
 The number of farmers was the highest and their condition was low and thoughtful
 kisaanon ko rajya, carch tathaa anya jamidaaron ko anek prakaar ke kar dene padate the or saamanti atyaachaari ko sahanaa padataa tha
 In a sense, the main reason for the dissatisfaction of the farmers was the hardships and inconveniences being given by the feudal lords and the monarchy was silent on it
 is tarah kisaan itane duhkhi ho chuke the ki ve swayan hi ek krantikari tatv ke rup main parinat ho gaye or unhen kranti karne ke liye maatr ek sanket kii aavashyaktaa thi
 The middle class consisted of moneylender merchants, teachers, lawyers, doctors, writers, artists, employees etc
 unki aarthik dasha main avashya thik thi phir bhi ve tatkaaleen raajnneetik, saamaajik or aarthik paristhitiyon ke prati acroshit the
 This class had no political authority and the behavior of the clergy and the nobility was not good towards them
 is kaaran madhyavarg kulinon ke saamaajik shreshthata se ghrinaa rakhte tha or raajnneetik vyavastha main parivartan kar apane adhikaron ko praapt karne ke icchhuk tha
 This was the reason that he was the main contributor to the French Revolution and he led the revolution
 madhyavarg ke kuch aarthik shikaayatein bhi thi
 Due to the erstwhile commerce trade, this class had acquired wealth, but now in the feudal environment, there were many restrictions on their trade and had to pay tax in place
 ve apane vyapaar vyavsaay ke liye unmukt vaataavaran chaahate the
 For this, he led the revolution
 is tarah ham kah sakate hai ki france kii kranti francisi samaaj ke do paraspar virdohi guton ke sangharsh kaa parinaam thi
 On the one hand there were influential groups from the political point of view and on the other side from the economic point of view
 desh kii raajnneeti or sarkaar par prabhutv kaayam karne ke liye in donon virgon main sangharsh anivaary tha
 Thus the French Revolution of 1789 was a struggle against inequality in French society
 france kii aarthik avasthaa sankatagrast thi
 The state was on the verge of bankruptcy
 vastutah france ke raajaaon kii phijulkharchi tathaa lui 14wein ke lagaataar yudhon ke kaaran shahi kosh khaali ho gaya tha
 After his death, Louis 15th participated in the Austrian succession war and the Seven Year War, which further increased the burden on the treasury and eventually Louis 16th made France's economic condition worse by participating in the American War of Independence
 samraat, samraji or unke parivaar par rajya kii atyadhik raashi kharch kii jaati thi
 The palace of Versailles became a means of looting the treasury
 duusari taraf kar pranali asantoshjanak thi
 Due to privileges, the rich class was exempt from tax and the poor farmer who was economically poor was the only taxpayer
 is tarah rajkosh kii sthiti atyant sochneey ho gai thi
 In France, the government fixed income according to expenditure rather than spending according to income
 rajya rin ke boj tale dabta gaya
 Whether France was unable to pay the interest of the principal money means that the state had reached a state of bankruptcy
 desh kii aarthik durvyavastha ko vyapaar vaanijya ko protsaahan dekar sudhara ja saktaa tha parantu sarkaar kii vaanijya niti itani aniyantrit evam doshapurn thi ki usase rajya main utpaadan evam vyapaar kaa vikaas sambhav nahin tha
 Louis 16th tried to overcome the economic crisis through financial advisors like the Turks, Necker but these reform efforts could not be implemented because the privileged class did not accept the taxation on themselves
 antat visheshadhikaar unmoolan ke prastaavon ko paarit karne ke liye estate general kii baithak bulaane kii maang kii gai or 1789 i

 In the context of the role of philosophers in the French Revolution, two opinions emerge - one, the philosophers created the revolution by giving rise to the circumstances of the revolution and secondly the source of the revolution was in the faults of the national life of that time and in the mistakes of the government and The philosophers did not produce a revolution
 kisi bhi mat par nirnay dene ke purv un darshanikon ke vichaaron or kranti ke saath unke sambandhon ko samajhnaa vaanchhneeya hoga
 The determination of the popularity of the ideas of philosophers should be seen on the basis of the volumes and prevalence of the articles printed at that time
 montescue ne apni pustak 'da spirit of loj' main raja ke daivi adhikaron ke siddhanton kaa khandan kiya or francisi raajnneetik sansthaaon kii aalochana hi nahin ki varan vikalp bhi prastut kiya
 He wrote that the French government is an autocratic government because in France all the powers related to executive, judiciary and legislature are concentrated in the hands of one person ie the king, so the French people do not have freedom
 isi sadanrbh main usne “shakti ke pruthakkaran” kaa siddhanth diya jiske anusaar shashan ke teen pramukh ang-karypalika, nyaaypalik or vyavasthapika ko alag-alag haathon main rakhane kii salaah di
 He described the Government of England as ideal because there was a constitutional monarchy whereby the citizens were at liberty there
 is prakaar montescue ne shakti ke pruthakkaran ke madhyam se france kii nirankush raaj vyavastha par chot kii uske ye vichaar itane lokapriy hue ki 'da spirit of laaj' ke teen varshon main chah sanskaran prakashit hue
 It is to be noted here that Montescue neither talked of revolution nor the abolition of the monarchy, he just exposed the faults of autocratic monarchy and talked about constitutional monarchy
 waltare ne apni pustakon ke letters on inglish madhyam se britain kii udaar raajnneeti, dharm or vichaar swatantraaa kaa vishad chithran kiya tathaa puraatan francisi vyavastha se uski tulana kii or france main vyaapt buraaiyon evam kamiyon kaa ullekh kiya
 These books became very popular before being banned
 “waltare” ne carch ke bhrasht achaaran, ashishnutaa, anyaay, daman or atyaachaar ke virodh main likhaa
 Pointing fingers at the corruption of the church, he wrote that there is no Christian left because there was only one Christian and he was crucified
 usne likhaa ki kukhyat evam badnaam cheez ko kuchal do
 This was clearly an attack on the tyrannical monarchy of France and the tyranny of the Church
 waltare england ke sanvaidhanik rajtantr ke anuroop hi france main bhi vaisaa hi shashan sthapit karnaa chahta tha
 He said that i prefer the rule of one lion in place of hundred mice
 waltare ne kranti kii baat nahin kii lekin vichaar swatantraaa kii prishthbhumi taiyaar kii
 He exposed the evils of the ancient French system
 usne logon ke samaksh tatkaaleen francisi samaaj kaa aaina prastut kiya or yah bataaya ki aaina main daag kaha he
 Russo talked about the freedom of man through his book "emily", "social Contract", "rusoni"
 isane kaha ki manushya swatantrat paidaa hote hue bhi sarvatra zanjeeron se jakadaaa hua
 The only way to get rid of these chains is to return to the natural primitive state
 ruson ne kaha ki samuhik ichha se bane rajya kaa yah anivaary tathaa saarvbhaum kartavya he ki vah saare samaaj ko sarvopari maanate hue kaary ko sanchalit karen
 The people who have been entrusted with executive power are the executive, not the owner of the people, and their duty is to obey the orders of the people
 is tarah uskaa drudh vishwaas tha ki sarvopari satta janata ke haath main honi chahie kisi kisi ek vyakti yaa sanstha ke haath main nahin
 Sovereign power is rooted in the will of the people which is called "common will"
 rajya ke kanoon ko isi saamaanya ichha kii abhivyakti honi chahie lekin kanoon kaa swaroop aisa nahin rah gaya he, balki yah shaasha kii ichha par nirbhar rahane laga he
 The Russians also did not talk of revolution but considered all people as free and equal and the slogans of the French Revolution were influenced by his ideas of freedom, equality and fraternity
 nepolian ne uske mahatv ko sweekaar karte hue kaha ki yadi ruson nahin hota to france main kranti nahin hoti
 The popularity of the Russian social contract can be gauged from the fact that 13 editions were published in a year
 18veen shatabdi ke shreshth vichaarkon kii rachanaaon ko sankalit kar aam janata tak pahunchane kaa shrey francisi vidwaan didaro ko diya jaataa he isane ek gyaan kosh kaa prakaashan kiya
 In this, evils of governance, corruption of the church and inequality prevailing in every field were highlighted
 france kii sarkaar ne didaron ko apana ghor shatru mana or uski pustak par anek pratibandh lagaae
 a section of thinkers was focused on the economic disorder and analysis prevailing in France at this time
 in arthshaastriyon ko “phisyokrat” ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Prominent among them were the Turgans, the Quessanes, the Mirabs, etc
 quesane mukt vyapaar kaa samarthak tha
 Complete freedom of commercial production and distribution and was opposed to octroi and other taxes
 uskaa tark tha ki keval bhoomi sari sampatti kaa mul strot he
 Therefore, tax should be levied only on land, not on merchants and artisans
 lui 16wein ke kaal tak aate-aate france kii vittiya vyavastha rinon main dub chuki thim
 The American War of Independence stamped on the bankruptcy of France
 atah aarthik duravastha ko dur karne ke kram main turgon, nekar, colon jaise arthshaastriyon kii madad lee
 Cologne suggested taxing the privileged oligarchy which the nobles rejected
 antat stasts general kii baithak bulaai gai
 This meeting was taking place 175 years after 1789
 stats general kii baithak kaa samachar sunakar sabhi varg utsahit the
 The nobles hoped that in this meeting they would be able to obtain the privileges which were taken away at the time of Louis 14th
 madhyavarg ke logon kaa manaan tha ki ve apane paksh main pragatisheel nitiyon kaa nirdhaaran karvaa sakenge
 The farmers hoped that by raising their voice against feudal privileges, they would be able to secure their rights and be free from their exploitation cycle
 is tarah francisi rajtantr kaa samarthan karne ke liye francisi jansankhya kaa koi mahatvapurn bhaag taiyaar nahin tha
 In the session of the Estates General, there was a dispute between the third state and other states on the issue of voting system
 matdaan ke bare main kaha gaya ki prayek state kaa ek hi mat mana jayega
 In this way, the privileged class has two and the public has only one opinion
 jansadharan ke pratinidhiyon ne arthath 'tritiy state' ne is matdaan pranali kaa virodh kiya kyonki isse ve bahut main hote hue bhi alpamat main aa jate
 The third state wanted the representatives of the three categories to sit together and decide by majority, but the clergy and the elite wanted separate meetings
 atah tritiy state ne stats general kii baithak kaa bahishkaar kar apane ko samast raashtra kaa pratinidhi maanate hue rashtriya sabha ke rup main ghoshit kar diya or paas ke tennis court main apni sabha bulaai
 The French Revolution reached its end through various stages
 adhyayan kii suvidha kii drushti se kranti ko nimnlikhit chaar charnon main baantkar dekha ja saktaa he
 At this stage the Parisian mob established control of the Bastille fort
 is tarah kranti kii shuruuaat hui
 In fact, the Bastille fort was a symbol of tyranny and tyranny and its fall posed a deep challenge to the archaic system
 is ghatana kaa prabhaav france ke gramin kshetron main bhi padaa or graminon ne saamanti karon ke abhilekhon ko aag laga di
 These proceedings of the public also had a profound impact on the National Assembly
 atah 4 agast 1789 jo raat bhar kaa rashtriya sabha kaa adhiveshan chalaa jisamen kanoon nirmit karke sabhi visheshadhikaron ko samaapt kar diya
 Thus England and America were abolished
 rashtriya sabha kaa mahatvapurn kaary tha- ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan karnaa
 Therefore, the National Assembly was called the Constituent Assembly and on 26 August 1789, the Constituent Assembly declared human rights
 samvidhan sabha ne apane aadarshon tathaa uddeshyon ke rup main maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 This declaration emphasized the principle of equality and it was said that since all human beings are born equal, they should get equal rights
 in adhikaron main swatantraaa, sampatti suraksha tathaa atyaachaar ke virodh kaa adhikaar aadi shaamil the
 In this way, the Constituent Assembly declared the fundamental principles, freedom, equality and dominance of the people
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko ghoshnaa patr main baar-baar duharaaya gaya
 No one could be denied this right
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne carch kii sampatti ko jabt kar liya or janata par carch ke niyantran ko kam karne kaa prayaas kiya
 In this context, the Church was brought under the Kingdom and was transformed from the influence of the Pope of Rome into a National Church
 rajya ke prati padariyon kii vafadari surakshit karne ke liye "civil constichution of cllerji" banaaya gaya
 According to which the priests had to take an oath of allegiance to the state and they were elected by the public
 pope or kuch padariyon ne is kadam kaa virodh kiya
 The clergy who swore allegiance to the state were called "jurors" while those who did not take the oath were called "non-jurors"
 is kanoon se kranti ke viruddh ek maahaul nirmit hone laga kyonki abhi tak chote padariyon ne kranti kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Now they broke away from it and some clergy left the country and went abroad and started campaigning against the revolution in Europe there
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne france ke liye likhit sanvadhin taiyaar kiya or is samvidhan ko 1791 main lui solahaven ne apni sweekruti de di
 The Constitution emphasizes two things - one, the sovereign power of the state is vested in the people and second, the separation of power is in the interest of the state and the people
 yadhyapi shashan pranali rajtantratmak bani raheen parantu raja ke adhikaron ko simit kiya gaya
 He is no longer a lawmaker
 raja ko kisi desh se yuddh yaa sandhi karne kaa adhikaar nahin tha
 The authority to legislate was given to an assembly and its members numbered 745
 vyavasthapika ke sadasyon ke nirvachan ke liye nagarikon ko sakriy or nishkray do bhaagon main vibhakt kar diya gaya or matadhikaar keval sakriy nagarikon ko diya gaya
 Active citizens were those over the age of 25 who paid the state direct tax equal to three days' income while inactive citizens were those who were poor
 rashtriya sabha ne france kii prashasnic sanrachana main parivartan kiya
 The entire country was divided into 83 departments by abolishing the ancient provinces
 in departmenton ko Cantan or Comune main baanta gaya
 There was an Election Council to run the rule of each of the units, which were elected by active citizens
 is tarah sthaneey str se lekar kendriya str tak sari rajya vyavastha bargea varg main aa gai
 After the dissolution of the National Assembly, in 1791 AD, a 745-member administrative body came into existence
 is vyavasthapika sabha main adhyaksh ke daahine haath kii ore baithne vaale 'dakshinpanthi' kehalaae
 These people were orthodox and supportive of the monarchy, while those on the left were called 'leftists' and this group was of the original changeists who were radical and revolutionary
 radicals bhi do virgon main bante the- jirondist or doosraa jacobiyan
 Meanwhile, the fear of the French Revolution started spreading to other countries of Europe
 jo padri evam kuleen varg france se bhaag europe ke anya kshetron ke chale gaye the unhone kranti ke viruddh bhaavana failaai
 On the other hand, French revolutionaries wanted to propagate revolutionary principles in other countries as well
 faltah europe ke anya raja shankit hue
 As a result, the relations between revolutionary France and other countries of Europe deteriorated
 austria ne krantikariyon ke manaa karne par bhi france ke rajtantr ke samarthak sharnaarthiyon ko apane yahaan rahane diya tha
 Therefore, in April 1792, the Legislative Assembly declared war against Austria, but the French army was badly defeated
 is paraajay se france kii janata ko vishwaas ho gaya ki raja ne austria ko france kii sainya shakti or suraksha ke saare bhed bataa die hai
 Hence the public's attitude towards the king became fierce
 in sthitiyon main francisi rajtantr ke samarthan main prasha or austria ne ghoshnaa kii ki france kii janata raja kii ajna kaa paalan kare anyathaa ham unke viruddh kaarywahi karenge
 In this way the French Revolution created a war situation in Europe
 is ghoshnaa se france kii janata or ugr ho gai or usne raja ko gher liya
 The king escaped and took refuge in the assembly
 ab yah vichaar kiya jane laga ki vyavasthapika sabha bhang kii jaae; punah chunaav ho, nayi vyavasthapika sabha bane or vah rajtantr ke bhavishya par apana nirnay de
 With this, the assembly was abolished and a national convention was formed on the basis of adult suffrage
 21 sintabar 1792 ko neshnal kanveshan kaa pratham adhiveshan hua
 The Jacobian and Jirodist parties were prominent in this
 jacobiyan anushaasit or sangathit the
 He had influence on the Parisian crowd
 isamen pramukh netaa the- dante, robspier, heater aadi
 On the other side there were jirondists - these were educated and cultured people
 inhen kitaabi gyaan adhik tha
 As a result, they were not practical politicians
 pramukh netaa the- isnar, madam rolland, briso aadi
 It is to be understood here that both factions were advocates of the Republic, supporting the war against foreign powers
 antar keval swaroop kaa tha
 In fact, Jirodisto took a liberal position in France
 unka maananaa tha kii kranti bahut aage ja chuki he or uskaa ant hona chahie
 They were against bringing more social equality
 ve swatantraaa par adhik jor dete the
 On the other hand, the Jacobians emphasized more on equality and had a harmonious attitude towards the lower classes
 neshnal kanvension ke saamne teen pramukh samasyaayein thi- videshi akraman, raja kii maujuudagi or grihayuddh
 In September 1792, the French army occupied Belgium and in the south Nees and Savoy also came under its control
 in vijayon se holland, austria, prasha or england ghabara gaye
 The revolutionaries also declared in 1792 that the Republic of France was based on feelings of freedom, equality and fraternity, and it was their duty to spread these feelings
 france jin jagahon par aadhipatay kaayam karegaa vahaan krantikari siddhanton ko lagu karegaa or padariyon or kulinon kii sampatti chin legaa or jo bhi desh iskaa virodh karegaa use kranti kaa shutra samaj jayega
 The autocratic monarchy countries of Europe were frightened by this announcement and now the revolution of France turned to the whole of Europe, not France
 atah europea desh kranti ke prasar ko rokane ke liye ekajute ho gaye or england, holland, austria, prasha ke ek gut kaa france ke viruddh nirmaan hua
 This group defeated France in many places
 faltah videshi yuddh main france kii paraajay neshnal kanveshan ke samaksh ek mukhya samasya ban gai
 The National Convention passed a resolution that abolished the monarchy and established the republic
 raja par deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya gaya or mrityudand kii sajaa di gai
 The policy of the Jirendistas on the question of the slaughter of the king was not clear
 ve rajtantr ke virdohi to the lekin vadh ke prashn par janamat sangrah kii baat kar rahe the
 In contrast, the Jacobians believed that the king's treason had been proved
 atah use mrityudand diya janaa chahie
 Finally, on 16 January 1793, Louis 16th was hanged
 neshnal kanvension ko jacobiyan or jirodishton ke bich sangharsh kii samasya kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa
 In fact, France was beset by an economic crisis due to war, with prices soaring that the Convention enacted legislation to provide relief, a rule to collect debt from the rich
 in kadamon kaa jirondixton ne virodh kiya
 When Jacobio invaded the Convention with the help of the Paris mob and the commune, he took power and arrested Jirondisto and established a state of terror
 'aatank ke rajya' kii sthapana ke saath hi france ek baar punah avyavashtha kaa shikaar hua
 It was founded under the leadership of Robspier
 isamen krantikari, jansuraksha kii sthapana kii gai thi or jo koi jaikabins ke viruddh kaam karata use mrityudand kii sajaa di jaati
 Robespierre was influenced by the ideology of the Russians
 jiske anusaar “saamaanya ichha” hi saarvbhaumik ichha he
 Robespierre put opponents on the "guillotine" to control power
 atah sabhi vyakti apane jivan ko lekar sashankit ho uthe
 Finally in July 1794, Robespierre was imprisoned and hanged, ending the reign of Terror
 aantak ke rajya ke baad 'thermidorian kii pratikriya' hui
 Liberal Thermidorian leaders took over the power of the country and dissolved the militant state systems, declaring the Jacobians illegal
 aantak ke shashan ke dauraan lagaae gaye mulya tathaa paarishramik par se niyantran uthaa liya gaya
 Due to which the prices rose again, the influence of speculators increased and the rebellions in response, but these rebels were suppressed
 tritiy charan-1794-99 -“diarectory” kaa shashan vastutah neshnal kanvension ne ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan kar karypalika kaa uttardaayitv 5 sadasyeey “nideshak mandal” ko saunpa
 The rights of all the members of the board were equal
 prayek sadsy baari-baari se teen maheene ke liye adhyaksh hua karte the
 Each year a member term was to end and another member was to be appointed instead
 is tarah neshnal kanvension ke baad france main diarectory kaa shashan shuru hua jo 1795 se 1799 tak chalaa
 Hence, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule
 diarectory kaa yah shashan avyavasthit, dukhamay rahaa
 The Board of Directors was empowered to control the Armed Forces and to appoint Chiefs of Army, to make treaties or to wage war on behalf of France
 sanchaalak mandal ke saamne sabase pramukh samasya thi yuddh kii samasya, duusari taraf diarectory ke sadsy anubhavheen, ayogy tathaa bhrasht the
 Therefore, during the rule of the directory, various kinds of disturbances spread, unemployment increased, trade was halted and its foreign policy was also weak
 aisi sthiti main france kii janata ek aise shaasha kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kar rahi thi jo desh ke andar or baahar shanti sthapit kar sake tathaa videshi shaktiyon ko parrast kar sake
 During this period Napoleon established the honor of France by military victories and eventually ended the rule of the Directory and established control of power
 1799 main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kiya or france kaa pratham counsal bana or 1804 i
 main usne apane ko samraat ghoshit kar diya or is tarah nepolian ke taanaashaahee samrajyavaadee shashan kii shuruuaat hui
 France is the only country in Europe that has ensured the collapse of the archaic system through revolution
 is kranti kaa prabhaav europe tak hi simit na rahaa
 It affected the whole world
 kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kaa prasar puure europe main hua
 On the one hand, while it gave opportunity to new powers like nationalism, democraticism to flourish, on the other hand it also laid the foundation of modern dictatorship and militarism
 francisi kranti ke prabhaavon ko nimna binduon ke tahat samajha ja saktaa haih The nature of the French Revolution needs to be understood in light of the ideals of the revolution, the leadership of the revolution, the progress of the revolution, the changes brought during the revolution and the effects on the world
 is drushti se kranti ek aisi kranti thi jiskaa prarambh to kuleen varg ne kiya, phir aage chalakar iskaa netritv madhyavarg ke haathon main aayaa
 It remained under the influence of revolutionary elements for some time and ended with a military dictator
 is tarah francisi kranti us vishaal nadi kii tarah jo ucch parvat shikhar se prarambh hokar maarg main anek chote-mote parvaton ko laanghti hui kabhi teevr gati se, to mand gati se pravaahman rahi
 The French Revolution of 1789 can be seen as a bourgeois revolution
 kranti ke pratham charan main netritv tritiy state ke burjuai tatwon ke haathon main tha
 The middle class leadership should also formulate some principles keeping in mind personal property
 vastutah samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa to kar di gai kintu saamanti adhikaron ko yun hi nahin chhod diya gaya, balki bhumipatiyon kii kshatipurti karne ke baad hi kisaan kisi uttardaayitv se mukt ho sakate the
 Middle class influence can be seen in the Declaration of Human Rights
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko manushya ke naiysargik adhikaron kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya jo burjua hiton ke sangrakshan se sambandhit he
 Similarly, adult suffrage was talked about, but in the Constitution the word "citizen" was used in a very narrow sense
 naagarik ko sakriy va niskriy nagarikon main vibhajit kiya gaya
 Active citizens were those who paid at least three days' income as direct taxes and only had the right to vote
 pratinidhi hone ke liye bhi sampatti kii yogyata ko aadhaar banaaya gaya or yah dhani log hi raajnneetik kriyakalapon main bhaag le sakate the or iskaa matlab tha ki dhani log madhyavarg se jude the
 In this way, the French Revolution destroyed the discrimination based on birth, but was replaced by the new feudalism based on wealth instead of ancient feudalism
 kranti ke dauraan krantikariyon ne nirankush sarkaar dwaara liye gaye rinon kii baat to kii kintu un rinon ko maaf karne kii baat kisi ne nahin kii
 The reason was that this loan was given to the government by the bourgeoisie
 isi prakaar sarkaar ne carch kii sampatti ko to jabt kiya parantu use bhoomihinon ko nahin baanta gaya
 The lands were sold at the highest prices and the middle class had the ability to buy this land
 francisi kranti ne mazdooron ke hiton ko najrandaaj kiya or shramik andolan ko hatotsahit kiya
 The working class played an important role during the revolution, but the bourgeois leadership did not approve of its growing position
 atah neshnal asembli ne nirankush rajtantr yug main nirmit kanoonon ko punah lagu kar diya
 Due to which all trade union related works were banned and guilds were declared illegal
 neshnal essembali main burjuaon kii pradhanta thi or usamen jirondist or jacobiyan bhi burjua varg se sambandhit the
 Although the Jacobians spoke of the interests of the proletariat, the establishment of a state of terror kept bourgeois interests above and army's help was taken to suppress the workers' reactions
 diarectory ke shashan main bhi madhyavargeey hiton ko pramukhataa di gai
 All members of the bicameral legislature that the governing board created were middle-class intellectuals
 nepolian ke sudhaaron par bhi burjuai prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 He protected the right to property in his code of law, preserving bourgeois interests, giving relatively broad rights to the nobles and the middle class benefited from its commercial and commercial reforms
 is tarah kranti ke swaroop main madhyavargeey tatv dikhaai dete hai
 But from the analysis of the entire revolution and its impact, it is clear that in the revolution there was co-existence of farmers, laborers, women with middle class elements
 is tareeke se yah maatr madhyavargeey kranti nahin thi apitu ek lokapriy kranti ke rup main ise dekha ja saktaa he
 The French Revolution took on a worldwide character
 krantikariyon ne 1789 main manushya tathaa naagarik adhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii, jiske tahat kaha gaya ki janm se samaan paidaa hone ke kaaran sabhi manushyon ko samaan adhikaar milanaa chahie or yah sabhi deshon ke liye sabhi manushyon ke liye, sabhi samay ke liye or udhaaharan swaroop sari duniya ke liye hai
 This declaration was made not just for France but for the good of all people everywhere who wanted to be independent and to be free from the burden of autocratic monarchy and feudal privileges
 neshnal essembali dwaara 1792 i
 main compene naamak angeraj nayak ko francisi naagarik kii oopaadhi di gai or use neshnal kanvension kaa pratinidh bhi chunaa gaya
 Similarly, during the revolution, the idea was to expand the revolution to other countries of Europe to keep it stable and strong
 isamen ek aise yuddh kii kalpana kii gai jisamen francisi senaayen padosi deshon main pravesh kar vahaan ke sthaneey krantikariyon se milakar rajtantr ko apdasth kar ganatantron kii sthapana karti he
 The French Revolution was not just a national event, but the whole Europe resonated with the principles - slogans of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke prabhaav itane doorgaami rahe ki samast europe isse aachhadit hua
 It was said in this context that "if France has a cold, then all of Europe sneezes
" ” The French Revolution was not as well planned as the Russian Revolution
 vastutah roosi kranti bolshevikon dwaara suniyojit thi or uskaa uddeshy satta hasil kar sarvhaara kaa shashan sthapit karnaa tha lekin francisi kranti shuru se ant tak ghatnaon or paristhitiyon kaa shikaar raheen or ghatnaayen is tarah se nahin ghati jis tarah se krantikariyon ne chaha balki ghatnaon ne krantikariyon ko apana rasta badalane ke liye majaboor kiya
 If the other states had accepted the third state in the meeting of the States General, the trend of revolution would have been second
 isi prakaar aatank kaa rajya or diarectory ke shashan bhi suniyojit dhang se nahin chale
 From this point of view this revolution was chaotic
 francisi kranti ke mul main tatkaaleen francisi samaaj kii duravastha bhi ek mahatvapurn kaarak thi
 The whole society was divided into privileged and unprivileged classes
 krishakon kii sthiti karon ke boj se kharaab thi to duusari taraf unhen saamanton ke atyaachaar tathaa carch ke hastkshep se bhi shoshan kaa shikaar hona padataa tha
 These conditions led the revolution and the revolutionaries raised their voice against this inequality and gave the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke dauraan hi samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa hui, visheshadhikaron ko khatm kiya gaya
 The general public had participated in the French Revolution, but by ignoring their interests, the revolution took the form of totalitarianism in which the principles and wishes of any one person dominated
 vastutah kranti ke dauraan robspier ke netritv main ek taanaashaahee sarkaar yaa adhinayakatantr kii sthapana hui thi or aage chalakar nepalian ne bhi adhinayakatantr kii sthapana kii
 The French Revolution was a strong reaction against all the distortions, inconsistencies and fundamental faults prevailing in the ancient system
 kranti ne nirankush rajtantr asamanta par aadhaarit francisi samaaj, vilasitapurna padri varg tathaa aarthik diwaaliyepan ke sankat se jujh rahe kushasan kaa ant kar france main prajatantric shashan pranali kaa maarg prashast kiya
 From this point of view, it can be seen as a progressive revolution
 itnaa hi nahin maanavdhikaron kii ghoshnaa swatantraaa, samanta va bandhutav ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ko avgat karaayaa parinamswaroop vishwa ke kai deshon main raajnneetik adhikaron kii maang ko lekar janandolan hone lage
 The spirit of unification of Italy and Germany was encouraged
 dharm or raajnneeti ke pruthakkaran kaa mudda pehali baar is kranti ke dauraan uthaa
 State and politics were separated from religion
 vishwa itihaas main france kii rajya kranti ko vishisht mahatv praapt he yah maanav itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana maani jaati he
 In this, not only France, but also brought a priceless change in the life of Europe, in this, by destroying the feudal system that had been prevailing in the past, it gave way to modern democratic system
 rajtantr kii nirankushta samaapt hui or loktantric vaataavarna main logon ne chaiyn kii saans lee
 At this time, the question arises in front of us why the revolution in 1789 AD was not in other European countries but in France first
 18 veen shatabdi ke europe rashtron kaa adhyayan karne se gyaat hota he ki us samay france kii jo sthiti thi usase bhi badtar anya europe rashtron kii thi
 The autocratic monarchy was weighed down by the class with ease and the unbearable burden of taxes
 saadhaaran varg praaia: sabhi europe deshon main maujud the
 The condition of some states was more distorted than France, Prasha, Austria and Russia etc
 were also more distorted than France
 francisi krishak anya europe rashtron kii apeksha khushaal the
 The condition of the ordinary class was worse in other European states
 phir bhi kranti in deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi hui
 The main reason for this was that the French people were aware of their situation
 kranti ke liye yah koi aavashyak shart nahin ki iskaa visphot usee deshon main ho jahaan ke log atyaachaar, anachar or shoshan ke shikaar ho
 Revolution can also happen in a rich and advanced country
 basharte uske nivasee yah mahasus kare ki unke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 The people of France were realizing this injustice
 or se dur karnaa chaahati thi
 Many philosophers and writers were born there who drew the attention of people to these sufferings through their writings, in spite of the worsening situation of other European countries, there was first a revolution against Louis Solven in France
 is kranti ke anek kaaran the jo is prakaar he
 Changed form of French feudalism and improved status of farmers francisi kisaanon kii unnat avasthaa or samantvaad kaa badla hua swarup aisa kaaran tha
 This led to the first state revolution in France
 europea desh ke kisaan abhi udaasi kii sthiti main the
 But the French peasants had become independent
 unke paas apni jameen apana makaan itani suvidha ke baavjud samant kar evam samant sevaaon kaa ant nahin hua tha unhen apni aamadani kaa bahut bada hissaa samant kar ke rup main chukaana padataa tha
 And still his position is good
 ve paise bachaakar kuch na- kuch jameen kharid liya karte the jameen kharidne kii bhukh nirantar badhati ja rahi thi isamen samant kar va berogari baadhak the at: ve samant peshon ko hataane kii baat soch rahe the at: madhyam varg ke netritv main unhe bal mila or 1789 i
 main unhone vidroh kar diya
 Lack of tradition of liberal autocracy in France- anya europea deshon main bhi nirankush rajtantr tha
 But the emperors there had reduced their autocracy over time
 prasha kaa raja fredirak apane samay kaa mahaan prabud prashaasak tha
 Other countries of Europe followed by Russia, Italy, Spain etc
 unhone samaynusaar jaataa kii aarthik bhautik tathaa anya kshetron main unnat karne kaa yatha sambhav prayaas kiya
 But France lacked such liberal autocracy
 vahaan ke raja janata kii bhalaai ke liye kuch nahin kar rahe the
 Rather, it became his policy to collect more taxes and exploit the public
 isliye france kii janata isse ub gai thi isliye france kii janata nirankush rajtantr ko samaapt karnaa chaahati thi
 Awareness of medium france main hi sarvapratham kranti hone kaa kaaran vahaan kaa madhyamvarg tha
 Other countries also had a middle class but they were not as cultural, rich and educated as in France
 unamem shakti kaa abhaav tha
 They could not think of rebelling against the king
 france main madhyam varg ke log anek kaaran se apane samraaton se asantusht the
 And for his own defense, Raj was desperate to curb power
 anya europea rajyon main is tarah kii sthiti kaa abhaav tha
 There was no one to lead in other countries, there was a ready middle class in France
 at: sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Usefulness of noble class kuleen vahg ko pahase visheshadhikaar is liye diya gaya tha ki ve shashan chalaane main raja kii madad kare
 And they also used to protect Janata
 parantu dhire – 2 yah kaary raja ke karmchaaree karne laga
 As a result, the usefulness of the nobility ended
 phir bhi iske visheshadhikaar main kisi prakaar kii katautee nahin kii gai
 Hence the peasants and middle class people started hating the Kulinwarg
 anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 There still remained the father of the nobility
 darshanikon kaa prabhaav- In the 18th century, there was a chaotic movement throughout Europe
 darshanik, vichaarak, vaagyanik sabhi deshon main viddhman the
 But the main among them were the French thinkers
 jinhone kranti kaa manovaigyanik aadhaar prastut kiya
 He drew the attention of the people to the evils in the society and gave a voice to the people
 is tarah kaa prayaas anya deshon main nahin kiya ja rahaa tha
 France was the only field of thinkers like Montague, Voltaire Russo
 austria, prasha or rus main is tarah ke vichaarak nahin the
 In other countries of Europe, there was no class of philosophers who gave their real status and created satisfaction in them
 france main hi kranti hone kaa yah ek pramukh kaaran tha
 Lack of political participation england main jab madhyam varg ne jaagarukta ai to use desh kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar diya gaya
 But this was not the case with France
 france kaa madhyam varg apane samraaton se kaaphi asantusht tha
 They were expected
 shikshit hone ke baavjood unhen kulinon kii tarah pratishtha uplabdh nahin thi
 They were not given the opportunity to participate in French politics
 isliye unhone asantusht hokar kranti kaa naaraa buland kiya
 Ineligible king and corruption in administration- france kii rajanithik vyavastha kendrikrut thi lekin raja ayogy the
 The administration was dominated by corruption
 europe ke anya deshon main nirankush shashan totha parantu raja yogya the or shashan par unka purn niyantran tha
 The middle class of France was feeling this administrative corruption
 tathaa isliye vah vidroh karne ke liye taiyaar tha
 Rise of national spirit is samay europe main teji se rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai hone laga
 France was the only country in entire Europe where there was a complete lack of a national spirit
 iske chalate bhi sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Effect of American freedom struggle- 1766 i
 main american swatantraaa sangram prarambh hua
 The American people revolted against England
 france ke sainikon ko bhi is swatantraaa sangram main bhaag lene kaa avasar mila at: unhone yah mahasus kiya ki yuddh ke dwaara swatantraaa prapti kii ja sakati he
 He also realized that freedom is possible only through freedom
 france lautne par unhone dekha kii jis swatantraaa ko liye unhonen america main yuddh kiya usee swatantraaa kaa france main purnat: abhaav he
 Hence, he became restless for the revolution here and tried to get freedom through war
 europe ke anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 Superiority of French Civilization france main hi kranti hone kaa ek vishisht kaaran yah tha ki yahan kii sabhyataa or saanskriti anya europe kii sabhyataa or saanskriti anya europe rashtron kii apeksha adhik samrudh or vaibhav purna thi
 Even in terms of governance, the rule of France was highly organized
 france sampoorn europe sabhyataa or saanskriti kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 Paris is considered the largest center of literature and thought in all of Europe
 france janamat anya europe rajyon kii apeksha adhik jaagrit or aalochanatmak tha
 As a result of all these reasons, in 1789 AD, there was revolution in France and not in other European states
 is lekh kii saamagree sammilit hui he britnica vishwakosh ekadashwein sanskaran se, ek prakaashan, jo ki jan saamaanya hetu pradarshit he

 Apart from this, this reaction has great importance in forming heterogeneous atoms with carbon like carbon-phosphorus, carbon-tin, carbon-silicon, carbon-boron etc
 grignard abhikriya main alkil- yaa aril manganecium hellide newcliophite ke rup main kaam karte hai or dhruviya bandhon main maujuud electrophylic carbon parmaanuon par akraman karke carbon-carbon bandha banaate hai
 These alkyls or aryl magnesium halide compounds have been named Grignard reagents, given their functionalities and usefulness in synthesis

 The first organic compounds of zinc were invented by scientist Edward Frankland in 1849, and 50 years later, in 1899, Barbier demonstrated the usefulness of magnesium metal in place of zinc in synthesis activities

 This action can be expressed, for example, by the following equation: Magnesium turnings placed on a flask
 Covered with THF and a small piece of iodine added
 a solution of alkyl bromide was added while heating
 After completion of the addition, the mixture was heated for a while
 Formation of the Grignard reagent had completed
 a small amount of magnesium still remained in the flask
 The Grignard reagent thus prepared was cooled to 0 ° c before the addition of carbonyl compound
 The solution became cloudy since the Grignard reagent precipitated out
 a solution of carbonyl compound was added to the Grignard reagent
 The solution was warmed to room temperature
 The reaction was complete

 In ancient times there were no universities in the recognized sense in the countries of Europe, although there were many important schools, such as the philosophical schools of Athens, or the schools of literature and customs of Rome, which were higher education institutions

 But when Ishwar Singh announced to be the ruler of Jaipur before his intentions were completed, the enraged Madhosingh, together with his maternal uncle, Maharana of Udaipur and the kings of Bunda and Bundi, attacked Jaipur in 1744

 Maharaja Surajmal also reached Jaipur with the help of Ishwari Singh with ten thousand soldiers and in August 1748, Jaipur was again conquered in the battle under the leadership of General Hargovind Natani at Bagru, 20 miles from Jaipur
 " Ishwari Singh had great faith in his other minister Keshavdas Khatri, but he did not like Hargovind Natani with a teary eye
 keshavadas khatri kaa chunki maraathon main bhi sammaan tha or malhaar raav holkar bhi uski baat mana karata tha, rajmahal ke yuddh ke baad hargovind nataani ne raja ko bahakaaya ki keshavadas khatri bheetar se maraathon se mila hua he or jaipur par hamale 'usee kii shah par' hote aa rahe hai, ishwarisingh ne nataani kii is baat par bina pushti yakeen karte hue ek din keshavadas khatri ko vish dilava kar marava daalaa

 Madhuresh is famous mainly in the field of Hindi literature as a narrator
 aarambh se hi hindi kahani evam hindi upanyaas donon kii samiksha se jude madhuresh ke lekhan kii mukhya visheshta praayah unka santulit drushtikon, vivaad-rahit vishleshan tathaa sahaj sampreshnty style rahi he
 In relatively later writings, he has moved away from story-review to some controversial writing
 moulik lekhan ke atirikt unke dwaara sampadit pustakon kii bhi ek lambi shrunkhlaa maujuud he
 Ramprakash Shankadhar is the original name of Madhuresh, who has been active in Hindi fiction review for almost five decades
 unka janm 10 janvari, 1939 i0 ko bareli main ek nimna-madhyavitt parivaar main hua
 All his studies were done there
 bareli college, bareli se angreji or hindi main em0e0 karne ke atirikt unhone pi-ech0di0 kii oopaadhi bhi praapt kii
 He chose the field of teaching for livelihood
 kuch varsh angreji padhaane ke baad unhone lagbhag tees varsh shivnarayan das post graduate college, badaayun ke hindi vibhaag main adhyaapan kiya
 Retired on June 30, 1999, and is fully active in literature
 armbh main unke kuch lekh angreji main bhi prakashit hue
 Many of his works have also been translated into various Indian languages
 madhuresh ke aalochanatmak lekhan kii shuruyaat san 1962 se hui
 The first critical commentary, 'yashpal: a Symbol of a Balanced Review', appeared in the 'lehar' of the year 62
 swayan madhuresh ji ke shabdon main meri us tippanee ne mere liye sabase bada kaam yah kiya ki kaaphi kuch mujhe yashpal kaa ek sambhavit pramanik or vishwasaneey bhashyakaar bana diya
 Although Madhuresh has done considerable labor and impetuous work in critiquing both the story and the novel, he has been more recognized as a story-critic
 kareeb do darjan moulik tathaa ek darjan se adhik sampadit --gunatmak evam maatraatmak donon drushtiyon se samrudh-- pustakon ke lekhak-sampadak madhuresh kii kritiyon main unki do pustakon hindi kahani : asmita kii talash, tathaa nayi kahani : punarvichaar kii sthiti 'ridh' kii tarah he tathaa ye donon pustaken unke yash kaa aadhaar bhi hai --samarthy evam seemaa donon ke liye
 Often away from controversies, he acted almost like a seeker in favor of the spontaneous public awareness of literature against the personal prejudices and mutual distractions of literature, through the sincere deliberation of stories and novels and considering the narrators-critics
 Have had a long struggle with haalaanki is kram main da0 ramvilas sharma ke prati vaicharik asahmati ke mudde tathaa da0 sharma dwaara upekshit sahityakaron par kaaphi had tak kendrit ho jane se kuch unke apane aagrah bhi prabal hokar unhen apane ko 'holtimer kahani-sameekshak' maanane ke baavjood apane mul aalochanatmak kaary kahani-aalochana se dur karte hai or sakriyata ke baavjood unhone samakaleen kahaniyon par 1996 ke baad praayah kuch khaas nahin likhaa
 If they had really focused on story-criticism, then the story-criticism of Hindi would have been quite rich
 'aalochana sadaiv ek sambhaavna he' main sankalit ravibhushan ji kaa brihat aalekh madhuresh ke lekhan kii samarthy evam seemaa donon kaa suchintit evam santulit vishleshan he
 Ravibhushan ji's conclusion at the end of the said article is visible - he has studied the stories more extensively than any narrator
 unke lekhan se unka shram jhaankata he
 They are less staggered
 unki kathalochana ko pustak-samikshaon ne prabhavit kiya he
 They are constantly active
 unki upeksha nahin kii ja sakati
 As far as his critical-vision is concerned, he is open, liberal and balanced
 divaana mujh sa nahin 1990 main bani hindi bhashaa kii premakahani film he
 The film stars Aamir Khan and Madhuri Dixit in the lead roles
 ajay sharma ek photographer hai
 Anita is a model and they both work for the same agency

 us samay bijapur kaa rajya aapasi sangharsh tathaa videshi akramanakal ke daur se guzar rahaa tha
 Instead of serving the Sultan of such an empire, he started organizing the Mavalas against Bijapur
 mawal pradesh pashchim ghat se judaa he or koi 150 kilometre lambaa or 30 kilometre chaudaa he
 They are considered to be skilled warriors because of leading a struggling life
 is pradesh main maratha or sabhi jati ke log rahete hai
 Shivaji Maharaj took people from all these castes and named them Mavals and organized everyone and became familiar with their state by contacting them
 mawal yuvakon ko laakar unhone durg nirmaan kaa kaary armbh kar diya tha
 The support of the Mavals proved to be as important for Shivaji Maharaj as the latter with the Afghans for Sher Shah Suri
 us samay bijapur aapasi sangharsh tathaa mughalon ke akraman se pareshaan tha
 Sultan of Bijapur, Adilshah, removed his army from many fortifications and handed them over to the local rulers or feudatories
 jab adilshaah biimaar padaa to bijapur main araajaktaa fail gai or shivaji maharaj ne avasar kaa laabh uthaakar bijapur main pravesh kaa nirnay liya
 Shivaji Maharaj adopted the policy of taking control of the fortifications of Bijapur in its later days
 sabase pehla durg tha torana kaa durg
 The fort of Toran was 30 kilometers southwest of Poona
 shivaji ne sultan adilshaah ke paas apana doot bhejkar khabar bhijwai kii ve pehle kiledaar kii tulana main behatar rakam dene ko taiyaar hai or yah kshetra unhen saunp diya jaye
 He had already bribed the court of Adilshah in his favor and according to the advice of his courtiers, Adilshah made Shivaji Maharaj the suzerain of that fort
 us durg main mili sampatti se shivaji maharaj ne durg kii surakshatmak kamiyon kii marammat kaa kaam karavaaya
 Some 10 kilometers away from this was the fort of Rajgarh and Shivaji Maharaj took control of this fort too

 He asked Shahji Raje to keep his son under control
 shivaji maharaj ne apane pita kii parvaah kiye bina apane pita ke kshetra kaa prabandh apane haathon main le liya or niyamit lagaan band kar diya
 After Rajgarh, he took the fort of Chakan and then the fort of Kondana
 kondana par adhikaar karte samay unhen ghoose deni padi
 After that, Aurangzeb sent Mirzaraja Jai singh and captured 23 forts
 Later Mavala Tanaji Malusare of Shivaji Maharaj captured the Kondhana fort but in that war he received the Virgati, after remembering the right of Kondana in his memory, he was named Sinhagad
 
 shahji raaje ko puna or soopa kii jagiradaari di gai thi or soopa kaa durg unke sambandhi baaji mohite ke haath main thi
 Shivaji Maharaj invaded the fort of Supa at night and took control of the fort and sent Baji Mohite to Shahaji Raje in Karnataka
 uski sena kaa kuch bhaag bhi shivaji maharaj kii seva main aa gaya
 At the same time, the fortress of Purandar died and a fight broke out between his three sons for the succession of the fort
 do bhaaiyon ke nimantran par shivaji maharaj purandar pahunche or kootneeti kaa sahaara lete hue unhone sabhi bhaaiyon ko bandi bana liya
 In this way, his authority was also established on the fort of Purandar
 ab tak kii ghatana main shivaji maharaj ko koi yuddh yaa khunkhraba nahin karnaa padaa tha
 By 1647 AD, he had also become the ruler of the territory from Chakan to Neera
 apni badi sainik shakti ke saath shivaji maharaj ne maidani ilaakon main pravesh karne kii yojana banaai
 Shivaji Maharaj sent an army against the Konkan under the leadership of Abaji Sonder by forming an cavalry army

 Apart from this, the fortifications of Tala, Mosmala and Raiti also came under Shivaji Maharaj

 After liberating the governor of Kalyan, Shivaji Maharaj turned to Colaba and incited the chiefs to wage war against foreigners
 bijapur kaa sultan shivaji maharaj kii harkaton se pehle hi aakrosh main tha
 He ordered Shivaji Maharaj's father to be arrested
 shahji raaje us samay karnataka main the or ek vishwasghaatee sahaayak baaji ghorpade dwaara bandi banaakar bijapur laae gaye
 He was also accused that he tried to obtain the service of Qutb Shah who was the ruler of Golconda and hence the enemy of Adilshah
 bijapur ke do saradaaron kii madhyasthata ke baad shahaji maharaj ko is shart par mukt kiya gaya ki ve shivaji maharaj par lagaam kasenge
 For the next four years, Shivaji Maharaj did not launch an attack against Bijipur
 is dauraan unhone apni sena sangathit kii
 Shivaji Rajane did not invade the areas of Bijapur according to the conditions of Salvation of Shahaji, but he tried to increase his power in the south-west
 par is kram main jaavali kaa rajya baadha kaa kaam kar rahaa tha
 The state was located in the far northwest of Satara, between the river Vama and Krishna
 yahan kaa raja chandrarav more tha jisane ye jaagir shivaji se praapt kii thi
 Shivaji asked the More ruler Chandra Rao to join Swaraj but Chandrarao joined with the Sultan of Bijapur
 san 1656 main shivaji ne apni sena lekar jaavali par akraman kar diya
 Chandrarao More and his two sons fought with Shivaji but in the end they were imprisoned but Chandrarao fled
 sthaneey logon ne shivaji ke is krity kaa virodh kiya par ve vidroh ko kuchalane main safal rahe
 With this, Shivaji got the property of eight dynasties stored in that fort
 iske alaava kai mawal sainik murarabaji deshpandey bhi shivaji kii sena main sammilit ho gaye
 Shivaji had both Bijapur and Mughal enemies
 us samay shahzada aurangzeb dakkan kaa soobedaar tha
 At the same time, Sultan Adilshah of Bijapur died on 1 November 1656, after which an atmosphere of chaos arose in Bijapur
 is sthiti kaa laabh uthaakar aurangzeb ne bijapur par akraman kar diya or shivaji ne aurangzeb kaa saath dene kii bajaay usapar dhaava bol diya
 His army attacked Junnar city and looted 200 horses with a lot of wealth
 ahmednagar se 700 ghode, chaar hathi ke alaava unhone gunda tathaa racin ke durg par bhi lutpaat machaai
 As a result, Aurangzeb was upset with Shivaji and the friendship negotiations ended
 shahjahan ke aadesh par aurangzeb ne bijapur ke saath sandhi kar lee or isi samay shahjahan biimaar pad gaya
 Aurangzeb migrated to North India as soon as he was afflicted and became the Shah of the Mughal Empire after imprisoning Shah Jahan there
 dakshin bharat main aurangzeb kii anupasthiti or bijapur kii dawandol raajnneetik sthit ko jaanakar shivaji ne samarji ko zanjeera par akraman karne ko kaha
 But his battle with the Siddis of Janjira lasted for several days
 iske baad shivaji ne khud zanjeera par akraman kiya or dakshin konkan par adhikaar kar liya or daman ke portugaliyon se vaarshik kar ekatra kiya
 After taking over Kalyan and Bhiwandi, they established a naval base there
 is samay tak shivaji 40 durgon ke maalik ban chuke the
 After Aurangzeb returned to Agra, the Sultan of Bijapur also breathed a sigh of relief
 ab shivaji hi bijapur ke sabase prabal shatru rah gaye the
 Shahaji was already asked to keep his son under control but Shahaji showed his inability to do so
 shivaji se nipatane ke liye bijapur ke sultan ne abdullah bhatari ko shivaji ke viruddh bheja
 Afzal traveled in 1659 with 120,000 soldiers
 tulajapur ke mandiron ko nasht karata hua vah satara ke 30 kilometre uttar vaai, shirval ke najadik tak aa gaya
 But Shivaji stayed on the fort of Pratapgarh
 afjal khan ne apane doot krishnaji bhaskar ko sandhi-vaarta ke liye bheja
 He sent a message through him that if Shivaji accepts the subjugation of Bijapur, the Sultan will give him the right to all the areas which are under Shivaji's control
 saath hi shivaji ko bijapur ke darbar main ek sammanit pad praapt hoga
 Though Shivaji's minister and advisor was in favor of As Sandhi, Shivaji did not like these talks
 unhone krishnaji bhaskar ko uchit sammaan dekar apane darbar main rakh liya or apane doot gopinath ko vastusthiti kaa jayja lene afjal khan ke paas bheja
 From Gopinath and Krishnaji Bhaskar, Shivaji felt that Afzal Khan wanted to imprison Shivaji by plotting a treaty
 atah unhone yuddh ke badale afjal khan ko ek bahumoolya uphaar bheja or is tarah afjal khan ko sandhi vaarta ke liye raji kiya
 Both of them had ambushed their soldiers at the place of peace, when the two met at the place of meeting, Afzal Khan attacked Shivaji with his Katiyar, in defense, Shivaji killed Afzal Khan with his clothes
 afjal khan kii mrityu ke baad shivaji ne panhala ke durg par adhikaar kar liya
 After this, along with taking control of the fortifications of Pawangarh and Vasantgarh, he also failed the attack of Rustom Khan
 isse rajapur tathaa daawul par bhi unka kabja ho gaya
 Now an atmosphere of terror had arisen in Bijapur and the feudals there, forgetting mutual differences, decided to attack Shivaji
 2 oktober 1665 ko bijapuri sena ne panhala durg par adhikaar kar liya
 Shivaji was in trouble, but taking advantage of the darkness of the night, he managed to escape
 bijapur ke sultan ne swayan kaman samhaalkar panhala, pavangadh par apana adhikaar waapas le liya, rajapur ko lut liya or shringargarh ke pradhan ko maar daalaa
 At the same time, due to the revolt of Siddijauhar in Karnataka, the Sultan of Bijapur entered into an agreement with Shivaji
 is sandhi main shivaji ke pita shahji ne madhyasthata kaa kaam kiya
 According to this treaty in 1662, Shivaji was recognized as an independent ruler by the Sultan of Bijapur
 isi sandhi ke anusaar uttar main kalyaan se lekar dakshin main ponda tak kaa or purv main indapur se lekar pashchim main daawul tak kaa bhubhag shivaji ke niyantran main aa gaya
 Shivaji's army had by this time 30,000 infantry and 1000 cavalry
 uttar bharat main badshaah banane kii hode khatm hone ke baad aurangzeb kaa dhyaan dakshin kii taraf gaya
 He was aware of Shivaji's growing sovereignty and appointed his maternal uncle Shaista Khan as the Subedar of the South for the purpose of keeping control over Shivaji
 shyska khan apane 1,50,000 phoj lekar soupan or chaakan ke durg par adhikaar kar puna pahunch gaya
 He looted in Maval for 3 years
 ek raat shivaji ne apane 350 mavalo ke saath unpar hamalaa kar diya
 Shaista managed to escape through the window but had to wash her hands with her four fingers in this sequence
 shysta khan ke putr, tathaa chalis rakshakon or anginat sainikon kaa katl kar diya gaya
 After this incident Aurangzeb made Shaista the Subedar of Bengal instead of Deccan and Shahzada Muazzam was sent to replace Shaista
 is jeet se shivaji kii pratishtha main vruddhi hui
 Six years later, Shaista Khan destroyed King Shivaji's entire Mulukh with his 15 xxrep 4 0 army
 is liye us kaa harjaana vasuul karne ke liye shivaji ne mughal kshetron main lutpaat machaana armbh kiya
 Surat was then a stronghold of Western merchants and a gateway for Hindustani Muslims to perform Haj
 yah ek samrudh nagar tha or iskaa bandargah bahut mahatvapurn tha
 Shivaji looted the wealthy merchants of Surat for six days in 1664 with an army of four thousand
 aam aadmi ko unhonen nahin lutaa or phir laut gaye
 The Dutch and the British have mentioned this incident in their articles
 us samay tak europea vyapaariyon ne bharat tathaa anya asian deshon main bas gayi the
 Until Nadir Shah invaded India, no European power thought of attacking the Indian Mughal Empire
 surat main shivaji kii lut se khinn hokar aurangzeb ne inayat khan ke sthaan par gayasuddin khan ko surat kaa faujadaar niyukt kiya
 And Shahzada Muazzam and Deputy General Raja Jaswant Singh were replaced by Diler Khan and Raja Jaisingh
 raja jaisingh ne bijapur ke sultan, europea shaktiyaan tathaa chote samanton kaa sahyog lekar shivaji par akraman kar diya
 In this war, Shivaji started to suffer loss and seeing the possibility of defeat, Shivaji sent a proposal for a treaty
 june 1665 main hui is sandhi ke mutabik shivaji 23 durg mughalon ko de denge or is tarah unke paas keval 12 durg batch jaayenge
 The income from these 23 fortifications was 4 lakh Huns annually
 balaghat or konkan ke kshetra shivaji ko milenge par unhen iske badale main 13 kishton main 40 lakh hun adaa karne honge
 Apart from this, they will also give revenue of 5 lakh Huns every year
 shivaji swayan aurangzeb ke darbar main hone se mukt rahenge par unke putr shambhaji ko mughal darbar main khidamat kerani hogi
 Shivaji will support the Mughals against Bijapur
 shivaji ko agra bulaayaa gaya jahaan unhen laga ki unhen uchit sammaan nahin mil rahaa he
 Against this, he showed his fury in the court and accused Aurangzeb of betrayal
 aurangzeb isse kshubdh hua or usne shivaji ko nazarkaid kar diya or unpar 5000 sainikon ke pehre laga diye
 Aurangzeb intended to kill King Shivaji a few days later
 lekin apane ajod saahas ore yukti ke saath shivaji or sambhaaji donon isse bhaagane main safal rahe
 Shivaji Maharaj went to Banaras after leaving Sambhaji in Mathura with a believing Brahmin, went to Puri and went safely to Rajgarh
 isse maraathon ko navajivan sa mil gaya
 Aurangzeb suspected Jaisingh and got him murdered by poisoning him
 jaswant singh ke dwaara pahal karne ke baad san 1668 main shivaji ne mughalon ke saath duusari baar sandhi kii
 Aurangzeb recognized Shivaji as the king
 shivaji ke putr shambhaji ko 5000 kii manasabadari mili or shivaji ko puna, chaakan or soopa kaa jila lautaa diya gaya
 However, the Mughal suzerainty over Sinhagad and Purandar remained
 san 1670 main surat nagar ko duusari baar shivaji ne lutaa
 Shivaji got the property worth 132 lakhs from the city and while returning he defeated the Mughal army again near Surat
 san 1674 tak shivaji ne un saare pradeshon par adhikaar kar liya tha jo purandar kii sandhi ke antargat unhen mughalon ko dene pade the
 After the establishment of an independent Hindu nation in western Maharashtra, Shivaji wanted to crown his coronation, but Muslim soldiers threatened the Brahmins that whoever crowned Shivaji would be killed
 When this thing reached Shivaji that the Mughal Sardar is making such threats, then Shivaji took it as a challenge and said that now he will get anointed from the Brahmin of that state who is in the authority of the Mughals
 Shivaji's personal secretary Balaji sent three emissaries to Kashi, because Kashi was under the Mughal Empire
 When the messengers gave the message, the Brahmins of Kashi were quite pleased
 But the Mughal soldiers came to know about this and then caught those Brahmins
 But wisely those Brahmins told those messengers in front of the Mughal sannyko that we do not know who Shivaji is
 What line are they from? The messengers did not know that is why they said we do not know
 Then in front of the Sardar of the Mughal soldiers, those Brahmins said that we have to go somewhere else, from which clan Shivaji you have not told, so how can we crown him
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back
 The Mughal Sardar was happy and left the Brahmins and thought of catching the messengers and sending them to Aurangzeb to Delhi, they too escaped silently
 After returning, he told this thing to Balaji Awa and Shivaji
 But surprisingly after two days the same Brahmin reached Raigad with his disciples and crowned Shivaji
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back
 The Mughal Sardar was happy and left the Brahmins and thought of catching the messengers and sending them to Aurangzeb to Delhi, they too escaped silently
 After returning, he told this thing to Balaji Awa and Shivaji
 But surprisingly after two days the same Brahmin reached Raigad with his disciples and crowned Shivaji
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back
 The Mughal Sardar was happy and left the Brahmins and thought of catching the messengers and sending them to Aurangzeb to Delhi, they too escaped silently
 After returning, he told this thing to Balaji Awa and Shivaji
 But surprisingly after two days the same Brahmin reached Raigad with his disciples and crowned Shivaji
 iske baad mughalo ne foot daalane kii koshis kii or shivaji ke rajbhishek ke baad bhi puna ke brahmanon ko dhamkee di kaha ki shivaji ko raja maanane se manaa karo

 shivaji ne ashtapradhan mandal kii sthapana kii
 vibhinn rajyon ke duuton, pratinidhiyon ke alaava videshi vyapaariyon ko bhi is samaaroh main aamantrit kiya gaya
 But 12 days after his coronation, his mother had died, for this reason, on 4 October 1674, Shivaji assumed the title of Chhatrapati for the second time
 do baar hue is samaaroh main lagbhag 50 lakh rupee kharch hue
 The establishment of Hindu Swaraj was announced in this ceremony
 vijaynagar ke patan ke baad dakshin main yah pehla hindu samrajya tha
 Like an independent ruler, he introduced a coin in his name
 iske baad bijapur ke sultan ne konkan vijay ke liye apane do senadhishon ko shivaji ke viruddh bheja par ve asafal rahe
 In 1677–78, Shivaji's attention shifted to Karnataka

 Shivaji died on 3 April 1680 after three weeks of illness
 us samay shivaji ke uttaradhikaar sambhaji ko mili
 Shivaji had the eldest son Sambhaji and a second son named Rajaram from his consort
 us samay rajaraam kii umr maatr 10 varsh thi atah maraathon ne shambhaji ko raja maan liya
 Seeing the demise of Aurangzeb King Shivaji at that time, with the desire to rule his whole India, he went out to conquer South India with his 500,000 army
 aurangzeb ne dakshin main atehi adilshaahi 2 dino main ore qutubashhi 1 hi dino main khatam kar di
 But the Marathas, under the leadership of King Sambhaji, maintained their independence while fighting for 9 years
 aurangzeb ke putr shahjada akbar ne aurangzeb ke kilaaf vidroh kar diya
 Sambhaji gave him shelter in his place
 aurangzeb ne ab phir joardaar tareeke se sambhaji ke kilaaf akraman karnaa shuru kiya
 Finally, in 1689, Sambhaji's wife's brother, Sambhaji, by the mouth of Ganji Shirke, made Sambhaji a prisoner by Mukarav Khan
 aurangzeb ne raja sambhaji se badasluki kii or bura haal kar ke maar diya
 Seeing his king being mistreated by Aurangzeb and badly hit, the Pura Maratha Swarajya became angry
 unhone apni puri takat se teesraa rajaraam ke netritv main mughalon se sangharsh jari rakhaa
 Rajaram died in 1700 AD
 uske baad rajaraam kii patni tarabai 4 varshiya putr shivaji dwitiya kii sangrakshika banakar raaj karti rahi
 Ultimately 25 years of tired Maratha war fighting of the kingdom was buried in the self-rule of Shivaji, the same chhatrapati of Aurangzeb
 shivaji ko ek kushal or prabud samraat ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Although he did not get much traditional education in his childhood, he was familiar with Indian history and politics
 unhone shukracharya tathaa kautilya ko adarsh maanakar kootneeti kaa sahaara lenaa kai baar uchit samajha tha
 Like his contemporary Mughals, he was also an autocratic ruler, that is, the entire reins of governance were in the hands of the king
 par unke prashaskeey kaaryon main madad ke liye aath mantriyon kii ek parishad thi jinhen ashtapradhan kaha jaataa tha
 In this, the head of the ministers was called Peshwa, who was the most prominent figure after the king

 Shivaji used to call himself the Sardeshmukh of the Marathas and in this capacity, Sardeshmukhi tax was collected
 rajbhishek ke baad unhone apane ek mantri ko shaskeey upyog main aane vaale farsi shabdon ke liye upyukt sanskrit shabd nirmit karne kaa kaary saunpa
 Ramchandra Amatya, with the help of a scholar named Dhundhiraja, composed a book called 'rajyavarthakosh'
 is kosh main 1380 farsi ke prashasnic shabdon ke tulya sanskrit shabd the
 Ramchandra has written in it- shivaji ek samarpit hindu the tathaa vah dharmik sahishnu bhi the
 Muslims had religious freedom in their empire
 kai masjidon ke nirmaan ke liye shivaji ne anudaan diya
 Like Hindu Pandits, Muslim saints and fakirs were also respected
 unki sena main musalmaan sainik bhi the
 Shivaji used to promote Hindu culture
 parmparik hindu mulyon tathaa shiksha par bal diya jaataa tha
 He also started his campaigns often on the occasion of Dussehra

 inkaa prakope sardiyon main aam he, jabaki jaade ke ant or basant ke prarambh main inaki sankhya adhiktam str par dekhi jaati he
 Binded animals are about 2 times more susceptible to infection than animals that are kept independently
 jab pashuon main atyadhik atikaraman se unke saamaanya vyavhaar main parivartan ho jaataa he, to rokthaam ke sarthak prayaas kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Magnet therapy is a medical practice
 isaki do paddatiyaan prachlit hai- sarvadaihik arthath hatheliyon va talvon par lagane se tathaa sthanik arthath rogagrast bhaag par lagane se
 According to this, based on the electrical correlation of the body by taking a pair of North Pole and South Pole magnets, the North Pole magnet is usually used on the right side, forward and northern parts of the body, while the South Pole magnet
 It is used on the left parts of the body, on the back and on the lower parts
 yah atal niyam chumbakon ke sarvadaihik prayog par hi lagu hota he, jabaki sthanik prayog kii avasthaa main rog sankraman, dard, sujan aadi par adhik dhyaan diya jaataa he
 To get the best results, when the disease or its spread is above the upper part of the body ie the navel, the magnets are applied to the palms, while in the diseases of lower parts of the body, ie below the navel, the magnets are applied to the soles
 isamen chumbakon ko un sthanon par lagaaya jaataa he, jo rogagrast hote hai, jaise- ghutana or pair, dardanaak kasheruka, aankh, naak aadi
 According to the intensity and form of the disease, one, two and even three magnets can be used
 jaise ghutane tathaa gardan ke tej dard main do chumbakon ko alag-alag ghutanon par tathaa tisare chumbak ko gardan kii dardanaak kasheruka par lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The method of this experiment is also useful in the case of endemic disease infection
 anguthe main tej dard hone jaisi kuch avasthaaon main kabhi-kabhi donon chumbakon ke dhruvon ke bich angutha rakhane se turant aaraam miltaa he
 Mainly, two methods of magnetic therapy are prevalent - 1
 Applying the universal means on the palms and soles and 2
 Applying on the local area ie the diseased part
 inkaa varnan yahan diya ja rahaa he - According to this method, a pair of magnets filled with the North Pole and South Dhruva is taken
 sharir ke vidyutiya sahasambandh ke aadhaar par saamanyatya uttari dhruv vaale chumbak kaa prayog sharir ke daayen bhaagon par, aage kii ore va uttari bhaagon par kiya jaataa he, jabaki dakshini dhruv vaale chumbak kaa prayog sharir ke baayein bhaagon par, peeth par tathaa nichle bhaagon par kiya jaataa he
 This firm rule applies only to the universal use of magnets, while in the case of endemic use, more attention is given to disease infection, pain, swelling etc
 uttam parinaam hasil karne ke liye jab rog athwa uskaa prasar sharir ke upree bhaag arthath naabhi se upar ho to chumbakon ko hatheliyon par lagaaya jaataa he, jabaki sharir ke nichle bhaagon arthath naabhi se neeche vidyaman rogon main chumbakon ko talvon main lagaaya jaataa he
 In this method of application, magnets are placed in places that are diseased, such as the knees and feet, painful vertebrae, eyes, nose, etc
 inamen rog kii tivrata tathaa rup ke anusaar ek, do or yahan tak ki teen chumbakon kaa prayog bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, in severe pain of knee and neck, two magnets can be applied on different knees and third magnet can be applied on painful vertebrae of neck
 is prayog vidhi kii upyogita sthanik rog sankraman kii avasthaa main bhi hoti he
 In some situations like severe pain in the thumb, sometimes keeping the thumb between the poles of both magnets gives instant relief
 yah har aayu ke nar-naariyon ke liye gunakari he
 Treatment through magnets is so simple that it can be tried at any time, anywhere and on any part of the body
 purush ho yaa stri, jawan ho yaa boodha, sabhi isse labhanvit ho sakate hai
 The magnetism improves blood circulation; If the magnet is in contact with the body for some time, heat is produced in the body, all its functions are improved and blood circulation increases
 is kaaran saare sharir ko shakti milti he, rog dur hone main sahaayta milti he, thakaavat or durbalata dur hoti he, jisase rogi sheeghra swasthya laabh karata he or sharir ke prayek ang kii pidaa or sujan bhi dur ho jaati he
 In some cases, this method is so powerful and its effect is so rapid that it is often enough to eliminate the disease forever
 kai maamalon main duusari baar chumbak lagane kii aavashyaktaa hi nahin padati
 Such as in tooth aches and sprains etc
 pehle se taiyaari jaruri nahin ek hi chumbak kaa anek vyakti upyog kar sakate hai
 They do not need to be cleaned, washed, or sterilized
 yadhyapi twachaa ke sankramak rog kii chikitsa main jis chumbak kaa upyog hua ho, uski safai kerani padati he
 If you have used a thin cloth cover then there is no question of cleaning the magnet, just cleaning the cloth is sufficient
 isaki lat nahin padati chumbak ke upachaar kii aadat nahin padati or uskaa upyog achaanak band kar diya jaae to bhi koi mushkil khadi nahin hoti
 Magnet pulls the pain from the body
 Every disease must have some kind of pain
 pidaa chaahe kisi kaaran se ho, chumbak main use ghataane, balki samaapt tak karne kaa gun he
 With his help, all body functions become normal
 isi kaaran sabhi rogon par chumbakon kaa prabhaav padataa he, pidaa dur ho jaati he or sharir kii kriyaaon ke vikaar thik ho jate hai
 The size and design of the magnet will depend on which part of the body it is mounted on
 sharir ke kuch ang aise hai, jahaan bade aakaar ke chumbak nahin lag sakate, kuch angon par chote chumbak thik se kaam nahin karenge
 For example, if a magnet is to be applied to the eye, it should be a small size circular magnet, which comes over the closed eye
 duusari ore agar sharir ke adhiktar bhaagon main pidaa yaa sujan he to bade aakaar kaa chumbak lagegaa
 Therefore, the same size-type magnet cannot be used on different parts of the body
 chumbakon kii shakti par bhi yahi baat lagu hoti he
 Some soft parts of the body such as brain, eye and heart should not be fitted with high power magnets nor should medium power magnets be installed for a long time
 iske vipareet kam shakti vaale chumbak kadi or bade aakaar kii mansapeshiyon yaa haddiyon ke rogon ke liye kaaphi nahin honge, jaise ki kulhon, janghaaon, ghutanon yaa ediyon kii hoti hai
 These things should be kept in mind in the choice of magnets not only for local diseases but also for the whole body
 upachaar lete samay jameen athwa kisi lohe kii vastu se rogi kaa sampark na ho, yah aavashyak he
 So an iron chair or bed is forbidden, while a wooden chair or bed is ideal
 chumbakon kii sthiti is prakaar rahani chahie ki uttari dhruv uttar disha kii ore tathaa dakshini dhruv dakshin disha kii ore rahe
 This will keep the magnetic field parallel to the Earth's magnetic field and make the magnet more effective
 yadi do chumbakon ke do alag-alag dhruvon kaa prayog ek hi samay kiya ja rahaa ho to rogi kaa munh pashchim kii ore hona chahie, jisase ki uske sharir kaa dahinaa bhaag uttar kii ore tathaa baayan bhaag dakshin kii ore rahe
 It is considered appropriate that spatial or general use of magnets is expedient from 10 minutes to 30 minutes
 vayaskon ke jeern amwati sandhishoth main pehle ek saptaah tak chumbakon kaa prayog keval 10 minute tak karnaa chahie or is avadhi ko dhire-dhire 30 minute tak badha dena chahie
 In many other diseases also the time should be extended accordingly
 adhik shaktishaalee chumbakon par tadnusaar gata deni chahie
 When using magnets on the Komlang like brain, it is well understood that powerful magnets are not used in it
 chumbak kaa prayog 10 minute se adhik kabhi na kiya jaae
 However, in relation to the period, its discretion is considered to be the best
 chumbak chikitsa kaa koi pratiprabhav nahin hota
 Still, do not worry if you feel symptoms of heaviness, vertigo, vomiting, saliva dripping etc
 aise kisi lakshan ko twarit dur karnaa jaruri ho to jaste yaa tambe kii ek pattee par donon haath 20-25 minute tak rakhen
 In the condition of inflammation of the vertebral neuralgia of the knees and neck, the use of magnets on the knees for 10 minutes in the morning and the last parts of the neck and pain for 10 minutes in the evening, but in these conditions the use of magnets should be from 10 minutes
 Should not be more
 gharelu nuskhe jaan-jahaan yun rahen swasth yon samasyaayen sehat samachar jadi-bootiyaan chikitsa paddatiyaan aahaar ayurveda 1) Time of magnet use chumbakon kaa prayog karne ke liye kisi samay vishesh niyam kaa paalan karnaa jaruri nahin hota, lekin uchit rahata he yadi inkaa prayog praatavkalin shouch evam snaan aadi se nivrutt hokar athwa shaam ko rogi kii suvidhanusaar kiya jaae
 Utmost care should be taken in determining the time to use and use magnets
 anubhav bataata he ki kasheruka sandhishoth, janu sandhishoth tathaa qamar dard jaisi kuch rogavasthaayen shaareerik shram evam din kaa kaam khatm karne par shaam ko badhate hai
 Therefore, in such diseases, when magnets are used in the evening, then there is a lot of relief
 iske vipareet dast, kabjiyat tathaa badi aanton ke pradaah main chumbakon kaa prayog subah ke samay karnaa chahie
 According to Ayurveda, cough is said to be the main cause of diseases like cough, colds, colds, inflammation of respiratory tracts, pyorrhea and they increase in the morning
 pitt, amlata evam ruddhavaat jaise vaat sambandhi rog shaam ko badhate hai
 If we follow this principle, then in case of chest diseases and phlegm, magnets should be used in the morning
 yadi jigar vikaar jaise pittajnak rog hon, to chumbakon kaa prayog dopaher baad kiya janaa chahie tathaa jab pet yaa aanton ke andar hawa banati ho to chumbakon kaa prayog shaam ko kiya janaa chahie
 Every prudent magnet doctor should take all these facts into consideration when scheduling the use of magnets to his patient
 1
 chumbakon kaa prayog karte samay athwa uske turant baad icecream jaisi kisi thandi khaane-pine kii cheez kaa seven nahin kiya janaa chahie, anyathaa ve utakon par chumbakon ke prabhaav ko anaavashyak rup se kam kar dengi
 2
 Do not take magnetic treatment for two hours after meals, taking this treatment immediately after meals is likely to cause vomiting
 bhojan ke baad rakt paribhraman pet ke avyavon kii ore vishesh hota he, usamen vyavdhaan daalana uchit nahin he
 3
 Powerful magnets should not be used on pregnant women, as this sometimes leads to miscarriage
 aavashyaktaa ho to madhyam shakti tathaa alp shakti chumbakon kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he, lekin unhen garbhashay se dur rakhana chahie
 4
 Following the instructions given in the chapter on 'magnetic Water', the quantity of magnetic water should not be increased normally, otherwise it sometimes increases the body's activity and creates an uncomfortable situation
 bacchon ko chumbakeey jal dene par iskaa vishesh dhyaan rakhana chahie
 5
 Do not let the opposing poles of powerful magnets come in contact with each other
 kabhi aksmaat angulii bich main aa jaae to kuchal jane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Also, sticking magnets are difficult to separate
 6
 upachaar ke samay sharir se gahanaa yaa aisi vastuon ko hataa dena chahie jo chumbakatv kaa shoshan kar lete hai
 Some electrical appliances and watches can also be destroyed by the impact of magnets if they are not kept away from the magnets
 atah chumbakon ko inase dur rakhana chahie
 7
 When magnets are not used, the holder should be kept on top of them and handled well
 unhen jameen par nahin giraanaa chahie, kyonki aisi asaavadhaaniyon se chumbakon kii shakti mand pad jaati he tathaa anaavashyak rup se unke punarchumbakan kii aavashyaktaa pad jaati he
 Similarly, children should not be allowed to play with magnets
 8
 shaktishaalee chumbak lagane ke do ghante baad tak nahaana nahin chahie
 For this reason, it has been said that magnetic therapy should be done after bath in the morning
 9
 chumbakon ko yathasambhav lohe ke dibbe yaa almaari main na rakhen, lakdi kii peti yaa aisa hi koi saadhan pasand karen
 10
 Make sure that the magnets do not touch the water, otherwise they get rusty
 isi prakaar sharir ke jis hisse kaa upachaar karnaa ho, use pasinarahit karnaa na bhoolen
 11
 While treating dermatitis, do not keep the magnets in direct contact with the skin and keep a thin cloth in the middle
 12
 upachaar ke samay sharir par chumbakon kaa dabaav padana aavashyak nahin he, kintu ve sthir rahen yahi dekhnaa he
 In some instances, treatment is also given by rotating magnets
 13
 bade shaktishaalee chumbakon kaa upachaar din main ek yaa do baar liya ja saktaa he, chote alpasakti chumbakon ko sharir ke hisse ke saath puure din belt ke rup main baandhakar yaa tepe se chipkaakar bhi rakhaa ja saktaa he

 ozon hraas yaa ozon avakshay do alag lekin sambandhit prekshanon kaa varnan karata he; 1970 ke dashak ke baad se prithvi ke samtapmandal main ozon kii kul maatra main prati dashak lagbhag chaar pratishat kii dhimi lekin sthir kami aa rahi he;or samaan avadhi ke dauraan prithvi ke dhruviya kshetron ke upar samtapmandal kii ozon main adhik lekin mausami kami aa rahi he
 The latter phenomenon is commonly known as the ozone hole
 is jane maane santaap mandaleey ozon riktikaran ke alaava, kshobh mandaleey ozon riktikaran kii ghatnaayen bhi pai gai hai, jo basant ritu ke dauraan dhruviya kshetron kii sataha ke paas hota he
 The detailed mechanism by which polar ozone holes differ from mid-latitude depletion, but the most important process in both trends is the decomposition of ozone by atomic chlorine and bromine
 The main source of these halogen atoms in the stratosphere is the light decomposition of chloro-fluoro-carbon compounds, these compounds are commonly called phreon, as well as the light decomposition of bromo-fluoro-carbon compounds called halons
 in yogikon kaa samtapmandal main sthanantaran sataha par utsarjit hone ke baad hota he
 The ozone depletion mechanism also increases as cfcs and halons increase
 siefasi or anya kaarak padaarth saamanyatya ozon-riktikaran padaarth kehalaate hai
 Since the ozone layer prevents the most harmful UVB wavelengths of ultraviolet light from entering the Earth's atmosphere, ozone depletion remains a concern throughout the world for the same reason, the Montreal Protocol has been adopted, according to which CF The production of c and halon and other ozone depletion chemicals such as carbon tetra chloride and tri chloro ethane have been banned
 aisa andeh he ki kai prakaar ke jaivik parinaam jaise twachaa cancer main vruddhi, podhon kii kshati, samudr ke prakaash kshetra main plancton kii aabaadi main kami, ozon riktikaran ke kaaran badi hui parabengani kirnon kii vajah se hai
 Ozone degradation occurs due to ultraviolet rays
 oxigen ke teenon apper rup ozon-oxigen chakra main shaamil hai:oxigen parmaanu, oxigen gas or ozon gas 
 Ozone is formed in the stratosphere when oxygen molecules decompose by absorbing an ultraviolet photon of wavelength smaller than 240 nm
 yah oxigen ke do parmaanuon kaa nirmaan karata he
 Now atomic oxygen combines with O2 to form O3
 ozon anu 310 or 200 nm, ke bich ke yuvi prakaash ko avashoshit kar letaa he, jisase ozon vibhajit hokar ek oxigen parmaanu or ek O2 anu banaata he
 Now the oxygen atom combines with the oxygen molecule to form the ozone molecule again
 yah ek satat prakriya he jo tab khatm hoti he jab ek oxigen parmaanu ek ozon anu ke saath "punarsanyojit " hokar do O2 anu bana letaa he
 o + O3 → 2 O2 samtapmandal main ozon kii kul maatra kaa nirdhaaran prakaash rasaynic utpaadan or punarsangyojan ke bich ek santulan ke dwaara hota he
 Ozone can be destroyed by a number of free radical catalysts, the most important of which are hydroxyl radicals, nitric oxide radicals and atomic chlorine and bromine
 in sab ke prakritik or kritrim donon prakaar ke strot hai;vartmaan samay main, OH or NO kaa adhikansh bhaag
 samtapmandal main isaki prakritik utpatti hoti he lekin maanav kii kriyavidhiyon ke falswaroop oxigen chlorine or bromine main naatakeey rup se ucch vruddhi hui he
 cfcl3 + hν → cfcl2 + Cl ab chlorine or bromine ke parmaanu ozon ke anuon ko kai apghatni chakron ke dwaara nasht kar dete hai
 In the simplest example of such a cycle, a chlorine atom reacts with an ozone molecule, taking one of its oxygen atoms to form clo and releasing one oxygen molecule
 chlorine monooxide ozon ke duusare anu ke saath kriya karke ek anya chlorine parmaanu or do oxigen anu bana detii he
 The chemical reaction for this gas phase action is as follows: Cl + O3 → clo + O2 clo + O3 → Cl + 2 O2 samgr prabhaav ozon kii maatra main kami kaa kaaran ban jaataa he
 More complex systems have been discovered that lead to ozone destruction in the lower stratosphere
 ekmaatr chlorine parmaanu do saal tak ozon ko lagaataar nasht kar saktaa he
 In this reaction it can be removed from the cycle by forming species such as hydrogen chloride and chlorine nitrate
 ek parmaanu ke aadhaar par ozon ko nasht karne main bromine chlorine kii tulana main adhik prabhavi he
 But there is currently a small amount of bromine in the atmosphere
 iske parinamswaroop, samgr ozon riktikaran main chlorine or bromine donon mahatvapurn yogadan dete hai
 Laboratory studies show that fluorine and iodine atoms participate in homologous decomposition cycles
 haalanki, prithvi ke vayumandal main, fluorine ke parmaanu teji se jal or methen ke saath kriya karke prabal bandhan se yukt HF banaate hai
 Whereas organic molecules containing iodine react so rapidly in the lower atmosphere that they do not reach the stratosphere in sufficient quantities
 iske alaava, maatr ek chlorine parmaanu 1 xxrep 5 0 ozon anuon ke saath pratikriya karne main sakasham he
 This fact and the annual amount of free chlorine in the atmosphere by chloro-fluoro carbon demonstrate how dangerous cfcs are to the environment
 in ozon riktikaran rasayanon main ek kunjee anu daai chlorine peroxide ke apghaton par nayaa anusandhan, dhruviya ozon riktikaran ke vartmaan vaataavaran modelon kii purnataa par prashn uthaata he
 In particular, chemists at nasa's Jet Engine Laboratory in Pasadena, California, found in 2007 that heating in the stratosphere
 The spectrum and intensity of radiation present produce a state that is insufficient for the rate of chemical decomposition required to release chlorine radicals, this volume of chlorine radicals is necessary to elucidate the observed rates of depletion of ozone depletion

 Most of the apparent decrease in ozone has occurred in the lower stratosphere
 haalaanki, ozon main chhed ko in staron main ozon kii sandrata main ai kami ke rup main nahin napa jaataa he lekin bhoomi kii sataha ke ek bindu ke upar kul kollam ozon main kami ke dwaara ise napa jaataa he

 a 70% reduction in the ozone column was observed in Antarctica in the spring and was first reported in 1985, which is still ongoing

 Ozone holes occur during the Antarctic spring, from September to early December, as strong westerly winds begin to flow across the continent and form an atmospheric container
 is dhruviya bhavar ke bheetar nichali samtap mandaleey ozon kaa 50% se adhik bhaag antarctic vasant ritu ke dauraan nasht ho jaataa he
 As mentioned above, the overall cause of ozone depletion is the presence of chlorine-rich source gases
 In the presence of UV light, these gases decompose and release chlorine atoms, which cause ozone destruction

 Most of the destroyed ozone occurs in the lower stratosphere, in contrast to very little ozone depletion through homogeneous gas phase reactions, which occur initially in the upper stratosphere
 vasant ke ant ke paas garmi dene vaala taapmaana madhya disambar main bhavar ko tod detaa he
 When heated, ozone-rich air flows through lower latitudes, pscs are destroyed, the ozone depletion process stops, the ozone hole is filled
 haalaanki antarctic ozon hole kaa vaishvik ozon ko kam karne main bahut kam prabhaav hota he, yah prati dashak 4% hone kaa anumaan he, chhed ne bahut adhik ruchi paidaa kii he kyon ki: Since the ozone layer absorbs the sun's UVB, the ozone layer depletion can increase the level of surface UVB, causing damage, increasing the likelihood of skin cancer
 yah montrial protocol kaa kaaran tha
 Although ozone depletion of the stratosphere is related to CFC, there is sufficient reason to believe that ozone depletion will increase surface UVB, there is no direct evidence linking ozone depletion to increased skin cancer in humans

 Ozone, which is a minority component in the Earth's atmosphere, is responsible for most of the absorption of UVB radiation
 UVB vikiran kii maatra jo ozon parat main se hokar guzarati he, parat kii dhaalu path motaai / ghanatv ke saath ghaateey rup se kam ho jaati he
 a fact related to this is that the decrease in ozone in the atmosphere will be responsible for the significant increase in UVB levels near the surface

 The main public concern about the ozone hole is the effect of surface UV on human health
 In most places, so far, ozone depletion is only a few percent, with no direct evidence of health damage found in most latitudes
 ozon hole main ucch str kii kami duniya bhar main aam he, prabhaav adhik naatakeey ho sakate hai
 The ozone hole over Antarctica has become so large in some instances that it has reached the southern parts of Australia and New Zealand, according to environmentalists that the increase in surface UV may be significant

 The relationship between malignant melanoma and ultraviolet irradiation is not yet well known, but it appears that both UVB and UVA are involved
 Experiments on fish show that 90 to 95% of malignant melanomas are caused by UVA and visible radiation
 jabaki oposum par kiye gaye prayog UVB kii adhik bhoomika darshaate hai
 Because of this uncertainty, it is difficult to predict what effect ozone depletion has on the occurrence of melanoma
