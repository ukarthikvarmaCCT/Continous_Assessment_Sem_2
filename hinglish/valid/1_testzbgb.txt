 According to this rule, vidyutchumbakeey preran ke siddhanth kii khoj maaikel farade ne san 1831 main kii, or joseph henry ne bhi usee varsh swatantra rup se is siddhanth kii khoj kii
 Faraday presented this rule mathematically as follows - jahaan Lange's law applies to the direction of the force generated
 sankshep main lange kaa niyam yahi kahata he ki utpann vidyutvahak bal kii disha aisi hoti he jo utpann karne vaale kaaran kaa virodh kar sake
 The minus sign in the above formula indicates this
 vastav main 'farade kaa niyam' kai charnon main viksit hone ke baad apane vartmaan rup main aayaa he
 According to Faraday's law of induction introduced in 1831, the potential produced in a closed circuit is proportional to the number of magnetic flux lines crossing that circuit
 farade ne yah niyam maukhik rup se diya tha or isamen 'chumbakeey flux rekhaon kii sankhya' kii baat thi jis pariklpana ko usne hi viksit kiya tha
 For this reason, his concept could not be spread in the academic world
 1845 main jaakar newman ne is niyam ko ganitiya rup main likhaa- Where φ b { \ displaystyle \ Phi _ {B}} is a magnetic flux which is defined as follows- yahan tal s { \ displaystyle S} koi bhi tal he jiske kinare par uparokt band paripath sthit he
 Using the definition of potential, the following equations can be written as- jahaan e paripath ke kisi bindu par vidyut kshetra he
 You can also write Faraday's law using the Stokes theorem as follows: yahan prayukt rin chihn henrik lange kaa moulik yogadan he
 Lange stated that if the circuit is closed, the direction of current generated in the circuit is such that it opposes the reason for which it is generated

 In each war, the states that fight against each other are called "warring" states
 jo rajya kisi ore se nahin ladate athwa yuddh main koi bhaag nahin lete, ve tatasth rajya kahe jate hai
 Thus neutrality is the feeling of being neutral or neutral, which the third states not involved in the war hold towards the warring states and the warring states give their recognition to this sentiment
 nishpakshta athwa tatasthta kaa yah bhav tatasth rajyon or yuddhrat rajyon ke bich kuch kartavyon or kuch adhikaron kii sristi karata he
 Neutrality was not practiced in the ancient era
 un dinon yadi koi yuddh chhidata tha to yuddhrat donon rajyon ke atirikt anya tisare rajyon ko is baat kaa chunaav karnaa padataa tha ki ve in do main se kis paksh main sammilit hon
 They used to become friends of one and sutru of the other
 madhyakaalin yug main koi bhi rajya is prakaar kii ghoshnaa kar saktaa tha ki vah yuddhrat do pakshon main se kisi ek hi paksh kii sahaayta kar saktaa tha
 Neutrality gained place as an institution in international legislation in the 17th century, although it was still in its infancy and needed a long period of time to achieve its present form
 18veen shatabdi main pahunchakar hi saidhantik evam vyaavhaarik, donon roopon main yah baat maanya ho saki ki tatasth rajyon kaa yah kartavya he ki ve tatasth yaa nishpaksh rahen or yuddhrat rajyon kaa yah kartavya he ki ve tatasth rajyon ke adhikarashetra kaa sanman karen
 The First World War started in 1914
 us samay kai rajyon ne yah ghoshnaa kii ki ve tatasth rahengen
 The United States was among the states to make such a declaration
 parantu oktober, 1916 main america bhi yuddh main sammilit ho gaya
 At the end of the war the League of Nations ended the traditional law of neutrality
 ukt anubandh kii dhara 10 ke anusaar rashtrasang ke sadasyon ne sabhi sadsy rajyon kii kshetreey athwa pradeshik akhandta or raajnneetik swatantraaa kaa aadar karnaa sweekaar kiya
 When the Second World War broke out in September 1939, the traditional rule of neutrality was temporarily revived
 sanyukt rajya america tathaa kai anya deshon ne pun: aisi ghoshnaa kii ki ve is yuddh main tatasth rahenge
 Germany violated the neutrality of most of these states
 apane tatasthtakaal main bhi america ne udharpatta kanoon banaakar mitra shaktiyon ko is bahaane sahaayta pradaan kii ki in deshon kii suraksha swayan america kii suraksha ke liye aavashyak he
 The question has been disputed as to whether such conduct was appropriate in the days when America was predominantly neutral? dwitiya vishwayuddh kii samaapti ke uparaant san 1945 main jab sanyukt rashtrasang kaa adhikaarptr sweekrut hua to usne vaidhanik rup main tatasthta kaa ant kar diya
 There is no system of separate statutory existence of such states in that charter
 uske anusaar koi bhi rajya aise kisi yuddh main swechhaya tatasth nahin rah saktaa jiske sambandh main suraksha parishad ne kisi vishesh rajya ko shanti bhang karne kaa athwa agrakraman karne kaa apradhi paaya he or jiske liye sanyukt rashtrasang ne apane sadsy rashtron kaa aavahan kiya he ki ve ukt rajya ke viruddh sainik karwai karen
 Perpetual Neutrality - Perpetual or perpetual neutrality is the neutrality of states which are accepted by special treaties such as the neutrality of Switzerland
 swechhaprerit or paramparaagat tatasthta - yadi koi rajya swechha se tatasth rahata he or kisi sandhi dwaara apane ko tatasth nahin banaata, to uski tatasthta swechhaprerit tatasthta he
 On the other hand, if a state makes such a treaty that it will remain neutral when war breaks out, then its neutrality will be called traditional or practical neutrality
 sashastr tatasthta- yadi koi yuddhrat rajya kisi tatasth ke adhikarashetra kaa upyog karne kaa praytn karata he or vah tatasth rajya apni tatasthta kii raksha ke liye sainik kaarywahi karata he to aisi tatasthta kii raksha ke liye sainik karwai karata he to aisi tatasthta "sashastr tatasthta" kahi jaaygi
 The neutrality of Belgium, Holland and Switzerland at the time of World War II likewise armed neutrality
 kaaran, us samay ye rajya apni senaaon ko yuddh ke liye satat prastut rakhte the
 Total and Constitutional Neutrality - Neutrality of a state that is supposed to be "sovereign neutrality" remains neutral, but directly or indirectly provides some kind of assistance to one of the two warring parties
 duusari or, un rajyon kii tatasthta "sampurna tatasthta" maani jaaygi jo kisi bhi yuddhrat rajya ko kisi bhi prakaar kii koi sahaayta pradaan nahin karte
 1
 To have a sense of fairness against the warring states
 2
 tatasth rajya ke vyapaariyon dwaara nakebandi or varjit maal ke avaagaman sambandhi niyamon ko bhang karne par koi yuddhrat rajya unhen dand dene ke apane adhikaar kaa prayog kare to usamen apni sammati pradaan karnaa
 1
 To treat the coastal states in accordance with the sense of fairness
 2 shatrurajya ke prati tatasth rajyon ke vyapaar-vaanijya sambandhi athwa anya jo sambandh hon, unhe na dabaanaa
 If a warring state tries to break the neutrality of a neutral state, then that neutral state can always take up arms for its defense and its use of this force will not be considered an act of enmity
 kisi bhi tatasth rajya ko, apane pradesh ke bheetar se hokar kisi bhi yuddhrat rajya ko apni sena, yudhsaamagree athwa anya rasad aadi nikaal le jane kii, anumati nahin deni chahie
 But he can allow the warships of the warring states from his coastal region to pass through there
 in yupoton ko vahaan se hokar nikal jane de saktaa he
 He does not need to boycott these warships from their ports
 kintu is prakaar tatasth rajyon se hokar nikalate samay yuddhrat rajya ke yupoton ko aisa koi shatru kaary nahin karnaa chahie jisase shatru rajya ke yuddh poton ko koi haani pahunche
 Warring states should not take aggressive action against the enemy state by making the coast of neutral states or their own ports
 yuddhrat rajya ke sainik tatasth rajya ke adhikarashetra se hokar nikal jane kii cheshtaa karen to unhe balpurvak peeche hataa dena chahie
 If they are able to enter the jurisdiction of the neutral state, then the neutral state should keep their weapons under house arrest
 jahaan tak yudhbandiyon kaa prashn he, kisi bhi tatasth rajya main pravesh karte hi, apane vahaan pravesh karne ke kaaran hi ve mukt jo jate hai
 But it is the duty of the neutral state not to allow them to go to their army and work again
 tatasthta ke ulanghan antarrashtriya aparaadh maane jate hai, phir iske niyamon kaa ulanghan chaahe koi tatasth rajya kisi yuddhrat rajya ke viruddh kare, chaahe koi yuddhrat rajya kisi tatasth rajya ke viruddh kare
 These violations should be immediately remedied
 jis paksh par atyaachaar kiya gaya ho, vah atyaachaari paksh se kshatipurti kii maang kar saktaa he
 The aggrieved state can also wage war against the tyrannical state
 tatasth rajya kii sampatti par balaat adhikaar kar lene ke sambandh main jo kanoon he, uske aaj ke prachlit arth ke anusaar, kisi bhi yuddhrat rajya ko akraman athwa suraksha ke liye aavashyak hone par tatasth rajya kii sampatti kaa upyog karne athwa use nasht kar dene kaa adhikaar praapt he
 This right can also be exercised within the jurisdiction of a neutral state, can also be exercised under enemy territory and within the open sea
 yuddhrat rajya kisi tatasth rajya ko koi seva karne ke liye baadhya nahin kar saktaa, yon swechha se vah koi seva kar de to duusari baat he
 If the warring state uses the neutral state's property or destroys it, the warring state must compensate it

 India, which has a substantial Tamil population in South India, was facing the prospect of a Tamil retaliation at home, so it spoke to the Sri Lankan government about stopping the invasion to arrive at a political solution
 haalanki, bhartiya ke prayaason ko ansuna kar diya gaya tha
 In addition, given the increasing participation of Pakistani advisors, it was necessary for the Indian interest to organize a show of force

 29 july 1987 bharat-srilanka samjhaute par hastakshar ne shri lankai naagarik yuddh par ek asthaayee viraam laga diya
 Under the terms of the agreement, Colombo agreed to transfer power to the provinces, with Sri Lankan troops in the north withdrawing their barracks, disarming the Tamil rebels

 This was a good plan on paper

 War-hardened commandos were selected for the operation

 But soon the LTTE fighters and shooters, sitting on the tree, started raining bullets on the commandos

 On 21 May 1991, LTTE assassinated Rajiv Gandhi for his role in sending the IPKF to Sri Lanka
 IPKF kaa praathmik prabhaav yah rahaa he ki isane bharat kii aatankwaad virdohi takneekon or sainya siddhanton ko aakaar pradaan kiya he

 These allegations led to fierce protests and public outrage within India and Sri Lanka, particularly in Tamil Nadu where the IPKF was seen as an invading and gloomy force
 bhartiya sena ko srilanka ke purvottar praant main pravaas ke dauraan naagarik hatyakand, asvaichhik gaayab hone or balaatkaar main lipt hone ke liye aropit kiya gaya
 Incidents include complicity, such as the Valvettiturai massacre, in which 50 Tamils were killed by the Indian Peace Keeping Force on 2, 3 and 4 August 1989 in Valvettiturai, Jaffna

 Although in today's era we are creating a feeling of unity, unity and love in the whole world, but in the period when Britain ruled India, many myths arose from the translation of Vedas by some Anglo translators
 yah koi dosha nahin balki sonchi samajhi sajeesh thi
 His main task was to hollow out India and convert Hindus to Christians
 un angl anuvaadakon kaa kahana tha, "arya videshi hai
 He came to India and killed, tortured and ruled the people living here

 "but the historians of the same period proved that it is only a myth and there is not even a lot of truth in it and the ancestors of Hadappa Mohenjo Daro were also Aryans

 Some patriots like Bal Gangadhar Tilak also came to these British talks and started writing in a utopatang manner

 This omnipotent text of Vedic Age is also known as 'vedatrayi'
 pehle yah veda granth ek hi tha jiskaa naam yajurveda tha- ekaivasid yajurveda chaturdhah vyabhajat punah vahi yajurveda punah rik-yajus-saamah ke rup me prasiddh hua jisase vah 'trayee' kahalaaya | baad main veda ko padhanaa bahut kathin prathit hone laga, isliye usee ek veda ke teen yaa chaar vibhaag kiye gaye
 Then he came to be known as Vedatrayi in the form of Rigyajusam or Chaturveda as Rigyjusamatharva after a long time
 mantron kaa prakaar or aashay yani arth ke aadhaar par vargeekaran kiya gaya
 Its basis is as follows - vaidic parampara do prakaar ke he - brahm parampara or aditya parampara
 The Vedatrayi tradition of both traditions was famous in ancient times
 vishwa main shabd-prayog kii teen sheliyaan hoti he: padya, gadhy or gaan
 There are three such divisions 'verse, prose and song' of Vedas mantras - padya main akshar-sankhya tathaa paad evam viraam kaa nishchit niyam hota he
 Therefore, the noun of fixed letter-number and Ved-mantras with foot and punctuation is 'rik'
 jin mantron main chand ke niyamanusaar akshar-sankhya tathaa paad evam viraam rishidrisht nahin he, ve gadyatmak mantra 'yajuh' kehalaate hai or jitne mantra ganaatmak hai, ve mantra ‘'sam'’ kehalaate hai
 On the basis of these three types of word-publishing-styles, the word 'trilogy' is also used for Veda in scripture and folk
 yajurveda gadhysangrah he, at: is yajurveda main jo rugveda ke chandobaddh mantra hai, unako bhi yajurveda padhane ke samay gadhy jaisaa hi padhaa jaataa he
 The said four divisions of the Vedas were not separate before the end of Dwaparyuga
 us samay to rik, yajuh or sam - in teen shabd-shaileonme sangrahatmak ek vishisht adhyayaneey shabd-raashi hi veda kehalaati thi
 Atharva also became attached to Veda's counterpart after that, then in place of 'trilogy' he started being called 'chaturveda'
 When the Guru was angry, Yajnavalkya, who received all the Vedas from Aditya, said in his memory after Vedatrayi and in front of Puranas, including Atharva, Veda s Tharvapuranani eti
 vartmaan kaal main veda chaar hai- lekin pehle ye ek hi the
 In the present tense, the Vedas are considered four
 parantu in chaaron ko milakar ek hi 'veda granth' samajha jaataa tha
 Significantly, despite the trilogy, the Veda was one, then it was divided into four parts
 sunne se failane or peedi-dar-peedi yaad rakhane ke kaaran vaa srishtikarta brahmaji bhi apaurushey vanike rupame praapt karne ke kaaran shruti, swatah pramaan ke kaaran amnaay, purush bhinn ishvarkrut hone se apaurushey ityadi naam vedon ke hai
 Hearing and remembering Gurmukh in the order of reading and reciting the Veda is of great importance in terms of the preservation and success of the Veda
 isi kaaran veda ko ‘'shruti'’ bhi kehete hai
 The Veda is conserved through diligent practice, hence the name "amnaya"
 vedon kii raksharth maharishiyon ne asht vikrutiyonki rachana kii he -jataa maala shikha rekha dhwajo dando ratho ghanah | ashtau vikrutyah prokto krampurva maharaayah || jiske falswarup pracheen kalke tarah aaj bhi hrasv, deergh,plutt or udaatt,anudaatt swarit adike anurup mantroccharan hota he
 Accordingly, the classification of the Vedic word-zodiac of each branch - each Veda mentioned above has four parts
 pehle bhaag mantrabhag ke alaava anya teen bhagako veda na maanane vaale bhi hai lekin aisa vichaar tarkpurna siddh hote nahin dekha gaya hai
 In the eternal Vedic tradition, mantra, Brahmin, Aranyaka and Upanishad are the four components of the same Veda
 kul milakar vedake bhaag ye hai :- Despite the above four sections being Vedas, some people consider only 'samhita' as Vedas
 dwaparayug kii samaapti ke samay shrikrishnadwaipayan vedavyas ji ne yagyanushthan ke upyog ko drushtigat rakhkar us ek veda ke chaar vibhaag kar diye or in chaaron vibhaagon kii shiksha chaar shishyon ko di
 These four divisions are famous as Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda
 pel, vaishampayan, jaimini or sumantu naamak -chaar shishyon ko kramshah rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda kii shiksha di
 These four disciples taught Shakal etc
 to their different disciples
 in shishyon ke dwaara apane-apane adheen vedon ke prachaar va sangrakshan ke kaaran ve vaidic granth,charan ,shakha, pratishakha or anushaakha ke madhyam se bahut rupame vistaarit hogaye | unheen prachaarak rishiyon ke naam se prasiddh hai
 The aforementioned four disciples started as many disciples as they were called Charanasamuh
 Each stage has many branches in us
 or isi tarah pratishakha,anushaakha aadi ban gaye
 Several branches of the Vedas, that is, the method of lecture, have been described
 rishi patanjali ke mahabhashya ke anusaar rugveda kii 21, yajurveda kii 101, samaveda kii 1001, arthvveda kii 9 is prakaar 1131 shakhaaen hai parantu aaj 12 shakhaaen hi mul granthon main uplabdh hai
 The Vedic words of each branch of the Veda are available in four parts: 1
 Samhita 2
 Brahmin 3
 Aranyaka 4
 Upanishads
 kuch log inamen samhita ko hi veda maanate hai
 The remaining three parts are considered as the interpretation texts of the Vedas
 alag shakhaon main mul samhita to vahi rahati hai lekin aaranyak or brahman granthon main antar aa jaataa he
 Upanishad is also found in many mantras, as in the Shuklayujurveda mantrabhag, the Isavasopanishad
 In the old times, there were as many branches as there were mantras, Brahmins, Aranyakas and Upanishads
 Babajud of such branches is also found in texts of only 9 branches today
 anya shakhaonme kisiike mantra,kisiike brahman,kisiike aaranyak or kisiike upanishad hi paaya jaataa he
 Not only this, even more branches are found in Upanishads, only then more Upanishads are found
 vaidic rishiyu ne vedon ko janakalyanme pravrutt paaya
 The word Veda is formed by applying the suffix h to vid dhatu
 sanskrit grathon main vid gyane or vid laabhe jaise visheshnon se vid dhaatu se gyaan or laabh ke arth kaa bodh hota he
 The subjects of Vedas depend on their interpretation - topics like Agni, Yajna, Surya, Indra, Soma, Brahma, mana-atma, Jagatna, the qualities of substances, religion, couplets, meditation-yoga, Pran recurrently
 yajna main devtaa, dravya, uddeshy,or vidhi aadi viniyukt hote hai
 According to the texts, their description is as follows - rugveda ko chaaron vedon main sabase pracheen mana jaataa he

 Each class has some mantras

 This Veda has two distinctions - Krishna Yajurveda and Shukla Yajurveda
 krishna yajurveda kaa sankalan maharishi veda vyas ne kiya he
 Its other name is also Taittiriya Samhita
 isamen mantra or brahman bhaag mishrit hai
 Shukla Yajurveda - It was given by Surya as a sermon to Yajnavalkya
 isamen 15 shakhaaen thim parantu vartmaan main madhyandin ko jise vaajasaneyi bhi kehete hai praapt hai
 It has 40 chapters, 303 anuvakas and 1975 mantras
 antim chalisvaan adhyay eshavasyopanishad he
 This is the lyrical book
 isamen gaan vidya kaa bhandar he, yah bhartiya sangeet kaa mul he

 It can also be called the originator of worship

 Some people also find mantra-tantra in it
 yah veda jahaan brahm gyaan kaa upadesh karata he, vahiin moksh kaa upaay bhi bataata he
 It is also called Brahma Veda
 isamen mukhya rup main atharvan or angiras rishiyon ke mantra hone ke kaaran atharv angiras bhi kehete hai
 It is divided into 20 kandas
 prayek kand main kai-kai sutara hai or sutron main mantra hai
 There are a total of 5977 mantras in this Veda
 isaki aajkal do shakhaaen shounik evam pippalad hi uplabdh hai
 The scholar of the Atharvaveda is the author of the four Vedas
 yajna main rugveda kaa hota devon kaa aahnan karata he, samaveda kaa udgaata samgaan karata he, yajurveda kaa adhvaryu dev:kotikarm kaa vitan karata he tathaa atharvaveda kaa brahm puure yajna karm par niyantran rakhata he
 Ayurveda, Dhanurveda, Gandharva Veda and Sthapatya Veda - These have been told by the Upveda Katyayana of the four Vedas respectively
 vedon ke sarvangin anushilan ke liye shiksha, kalp, vyakaran, nirukt, chand or jyotish ke granth hai jinhen 6 ang kehete hai
 Pratipadasutra, Anupada, Chandobhasha, Dharmashastra, Justice and Vaiseshika - These 6 views are also available
 upangon ke vishay is prakaar hai - In the Veda samhita, there are signs of chanting their high, medium, or slow musical vowels by placing standing and horizontal lines in the mantras
 inako udaatt, anudaatt fir swaarit ke naam se abhihit kiya gaya he
 These vowels have been in vogue since ancient times and Mahamuni Patanjali has included his main cardinal rules in his great language
 swaron ko adhik yaa nune rup se bole jane ke kaaran inke bhi do-do bhed ho jate hai
 Such as udatta-udattar, anuadatta-anudattar, swarika-swarittodatta
 inke alaave ek or swar mana gaya he - shruti - isamen teenon swaron kaa milan ho jaataa he
 Thus the total number of vowels becomes 7
 in saat swaron main bhi aapas main milane se swaron main bhed ho jaataa he jiske liye swar chihnon main kuch parivartan ho jaataa he
 Although many methods are used in the marking and typing of these vowels and there is not a single mode common in publisher-commentators, in most places a horizontal line below the letter for the approved and a vertical line above the letter for the vocal
 Is the rule
 udaatt kaa apana koi chihn nahin he
 Due to this problem in marking, many writer-publishers do not use vowel signs at all
 vaidic mantron main prayukt chand kai prakaar ke hai jinamein mukhya hai- According to this, the ritual of Vedokta Yajna is considered to be the main use of the words of Veda
 sristi ke armbh se hi yajna karne main saadharantaya mantroccharan kii style, mantrakshar evam karm-vidhi main vividhta rahi he
 It is due to this diversity that the branches of the Vedas have expanded
 yatha-rugveda kii 21 shakha, yajurveda kii 101 shakha, samaveda kii 1000 shakha or atharvaveda kii 9 shakha- is prakaar kul 1,131 shakhaayen hai
 This number is also mentioned by Maharishi Patanjali in his great language
 uparyukt 1,131 shakhaon main se vartmaan main keval 12 shakhaayen hi mul granthon main uplabdh haih- Out of the above 12 branches, only 6 branches have the learning style - Shakal, Taittariya, Madhyandini, Karma, Kauthum and Shaunak Shakha
 yah kahana bhi anupyukt nahin hoga ki anya shakhaon ke kuch or bhi granth uplabdh hai, kintu unase shakha kaa puraa parichay nahin mil saktaa evam bahut-si shakhaon ke to naam bhi uplabdh nahin hai
 As mentioned above, understanding of many words of Vedas has not been as simple
 vedunkaa vaastavik arth samajhane ke liye inke bhitarase hi vedangunka avishkaar kiya gaya | isaki vajah inamen varnit arthon ko janaa nahi ja saktaa | sabase adhik vivaad-vaarta ishwar ke swaroop, yani ekmaatr yaa anek devon ke sadrishy ko lekar hua he
 The real meaning of Vedoun can be done only by those who know the education - Kalpa, Grammar, Nirukta, Chanda and Astrology
 europe ke sanskrit vidwaanon kii vyakhya bhi hind-arya jati ke siddhant se prerit rahi he
 In the ancient times itself, many such opinions appeared, challenging their power, which are still called religious views but are different in many ways
 inkaa mukhya antar neeche spasht kiya gaya he
 Among them, who are guided by the Vedas, shakhas, and Kalpasutra, who believe in a unique universe, believe in the Vedas by not engaging in any one god, they believe in the Vedic Sanatana Varnashrama religion, they consider Vedon as Sarvopari
 iske alaava alag alag vichaar rakhanevaale or pruthak pruthak devtaa maanane vaale kuch sampradaay ye hai-: The topics which have been disputed are given below
 yajna:yajna ke vartmaan rup ke mahatv ko lekar kai vidwaanon, maton or bhashkaron main virodhabhash he
 The use of fire in the yajna has been so much similar to the ancient Parsi worship method and scholars have been interested in the immense importance of havan
 devtaa:dev shabd kaa lekar hi kai vidwaanon main asahmati rahi he
 The Vedokta Nirguna - formless and saguna - in many faiths who believe in the last aspect of the form, consider it to be a great person with special powers as a great man and worship them in idol, while many others call them the names of God
 paroapkaar karne vaali vastuen, vidwaan log or maargdarshan karne vaale mantron ko dev kaha gaya he
 For example, by not understanding the meaning of the word fire, first of all, that is to say, God
 devtaa shavd kaa arth divya, yani parameshwar kii shakti se purna mana jaataa he - jaise prithvi aadi
 Mahadev, in this view, calls God because he is the Lord of the Gods
 isi tarah sarvatra vyapak ishwar vishnu or satya hone ke kaaran brahma kehalaata he
 In this way, Brahma, Vishnu and Mahadev are not names of any character but names of God
 vyakaran or niruktake valpar hi vaidic or loukik shabdonke arth nirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 In the absence of this, they sit in the waste of meaning
 isi praakar ganesh, prajapati, devi, buddha, lakshmi ityadi parameshwar ke hi naam hai
 The Vedadi scriptures belong to the same God
 jaisaa kii upanishadonme kaha gaya he- eko dev sarvbhooteshu guiah sarvyaapee sarvabhootantaraatma | kuch log ishwarke sagun- nirgun swarupame jhagadte rahete he
 Some of them do idolatry and there are people who are against idolatry and consider God as the only truth, paramount
 ashwamedh:ashwamedh se hinsa or bali kaa vichaar aata he
 This is surprising to many Hindus as purists have been avoiding violence in many places
 kaiyon kaa maananaa he ki medh shabd main adhwaran kaa bhi prayog hua he jiskaa arth he ahimsa
 Therefore, there must have been some other meaning of merit
 isi prakaar ashv shabd kaa arth ghoda na rahakar shakti rahaa hoga
 According to Shri Ram Sharma Acharya languages, the word Ashwa means power, the word Gau means nutrition
 isse ashwamedh kaa arth ghode kaa bali se itar hoti prathit hoti he
 Som: Some people consider it to be wine, but according to many translations it was made by code-grinding
 atah ye sharaab jaisaa koi peya nahin lagata
 But its true form has not been determined

 Nature decorates itself every second
 ham is pratipal honevaale parivartan ko usee tarah nahin dekh sakate jis tarah ham ek gulab ke phool main or duusare main koi antar nahin kar sakate
 We can easily identify this distinction only in familiar objects
 parichit vastuon main hi ham is bhed kii pahchaan aasaani se kar sakate hai
 It is a flaw of our vision that our eyes cannot detect subtle differences and subtle changes of nature
 manushya-charitra ko parakhnaa bhi bada kathin kaary he, kintu asambhav nahin he
 Tough it is not only because it has a mixture of diverse elements but also because it keeps on changing with the trauma of new situations
 vah chetan vastu he
 Change is his nature
 prayogshaala kii pareekshan nalee main rakhkar uskaa vishleshan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 His analysis has been trying for centuries

 Today's psychologists are also engaged in this
 phir bhi yah nahin kah sakate ki manushya-charitra kaa koi bhi santoshjanak vishleshan ho sakaa he
 Every child is like a rough stone, in which the beautiful idol is hidden, which the eye of the craftsman can see
 vah use taraash kar sundar murti main badal saktaa he
 Because the idol is already present in the stone, the craftsman simply shoves the useless stone in which the idol is covered, and the beautiful idol is revealed

 As a child develops, he imbibes the style of the society or community in which he grows up, leaving a deep impression on the personality
 ‘charitra’ shabd manushya ke sampoorn vyaktitv ko prakat karata he
 The word 'recognize yourself' has the same meaning as 'recognize your character'
 upanishdon ne jab kaha tha : ‘aatma vaare shrotvyo mantavyo nididhyasitavyah; nanyatosti vijanat:,’ tab isi durbodh manushya-charitra ko pahchaanane kii prerana kii thi
 Socrates, the great philosopher of Greece, also cried and said: Identify yourself! vigyaan ne manushya-sharir ko pahchaanane main bahut safalataa pai he
 But his internal laboratory remains a mystery
 is diwaar ke andar kii mashinari kis tarah kaam karti he, is prashn kaa uttar abhi tak aspasht kuhare main chipa hua he
 What we know is only an estimate of our intelligence
 pramanik rup se ham yah nahin kah sakate ki yahi sach he; itnaa hi kehete hai ki isse adhik spasht uttar hamen apane prashn kaa nahin mil sakaa he
 As soon as we have a desire to identify ourselves, we try to know what we are different from other humans
 bhed jaanane kii yah khoj hamen pehle yah jaanane ko vivash karti he ki kin baton main ham dusron ke samaan hai
 Without knowledge of commonalities, there can be no knowledge of differences or of its special character
 manovigyaan ne yah pataa lagaaya he ki prayek manushya kuch pravritiyon ke saath janm letaa he
 These natural, birth-born trends are the first motivators of man
 manushya hone ke naate prayek manushya ko in pravritiyon kii paridhi main hi apana kaaryakshetra simit rakhana padataa he
 What is the true form of these trends, how many are they in numbers, how is their balance, these secrets are not fully clear yet
 phir bhi kuch praathmik pravritiyon kaa naam pramanik rup se liya ja saktaa he
 Some of them are: darana, hansanaa, apni raksha karnaa, nai baaten jaanane kii koshish karnaa, dusron se milanaa-julna, apane ko mahatva main laana, sangrah karnaa, pet bharne ke liye koshish karnaa, bhinn yoni se bhoga kii ichha—in pravritiyon kii vaigyanik paribhaasha karnaa bada kathin kaam he
 There are many of these which are also found in animals, but there are some emotional trends which are not there in animals
 ve keval maanviya pravritiyaan he
 Collecting, bringing importance to oneself, feeling contentment in creative work, showing kindness, compassion, etc
 are some of the emotions that only humans have
 beej-rup main ye pravritiyaan manushya ke swabhaav main sadaa rahati he
 Yet man is not its slave
 apni buddhi se vah in pravritiyon kii aisi vyavastha kar letaa he ki uske vyaktitv ko unnat banane main ye pravritiyaan sahaayak ho saken
 Man's character is formed in the making of this system
 yahi charitra-nirmaan kii bhoomika he
 Compressing their natural tendencies so that they do not suppress their work power, they are helpful in driving them on the path of welfare, this is the ideal system and this is the preamble of character-building
 isi vyavastha kaa naam yoga he
 This balance has been called 'equanimity' by our scriptures
 yahi yoga he-‘samatvam yoga uchyate’ yahi vah yoga he jis ‘yoga: karmsu kaushalm’ kaha he
 This skill of balancing trends is the skill that gives success in every task of life
 isi sambuddhi vyakti ke liye gita main kaha he : Man has to strike this balance himself
 isiilie ham kehete hai ki manushya apane bhagya kaa swayan swami he
 He makes his own character
 charitra kisi ko uttaradhikaar main nahin miltaa
 We can learn some practical things from our parents, but we create our own character
 kabhi-kabhi mata-pita or putr ke charitra main samanta nazar aati hai, vah bhi uttaradhikaar main nahin, balki paristhitiyon-vash putr main aa jaati he
 No child is born with good or bad character
 haa, vah acchhee-buree paristhitiyon main avashya paidaa hota he, jo uske charitra-nirmaan main bhala-bura asar daalati hai
 Many times a single incident affects a man's life so much that his character is reversed
 jivan ke prati uskaa drushtikon hi badal jaataa he
 a gust of despair makes him forever pessimistic, or a work of sudden hopeful sympathy makes him forever young and benevolent
 vahi hamaari prakruti ban jaati he
 Therefore, it would be right to say that circumstances do not make our character, but our mental reactions towards them, it is from which our character becomes
 prayek manushya ke man main ek hi ghatana ke prati juda-juda pratikriya hoti he
 Many young people living together go through similar situations; But each person sees those situations differently; He has different reactions in his mind
 yahi pratikriyaayein hamen apane jivan kaa drushtikon banane main sahaayak hoti hai
 The manifest form of these reactions is what we bring to work in that situation
 ek bhikhaari ko dekhakar ek ke man main dayaa, jaagrit hui, duusare ke man main ghrinaa
 The person will give him money, the other will abuse him, or move away from himself
 kintu yaheen tak is pratikriya kaa prabhaav nahin hoga
 This is the external form of that reaction
 uskaa prabhaav donon ke man par bhi juda-juda hoga
 Character is formed by the effects of these routine
 yahi charitra banane kii prakriya he
 In the same process, some people become skeptical, some confident and some enjoy luxuries in physical enjoyment; Some become ascetic who hold firm to moral principles, others become impatient and others who wish for profit immediately can patiently wait for the outcome of the work
 yah prakriya bachapan se hi shuru hoti he
 From the third year of life, the child starts making his character
 sab bachche juda-juda paristhitiyon main rahete hai
 There is a lot to be learned from parents of different characters in making sense of those situations
 apane adhyapakon se yaa sangi-saathiyon se bhi sikhte hai
 But whatever they see or hear, not everyone can receive anything
 vah sab itnaa paraspar-virdohi hota he ki use grahan karnaa sambhav nahin hota
 He has to make the selection before consuming it
 swayan nirnay karnaa hota he ki koun-se gun grahya hai or koun-se tyajya
 This right of choice also gives the child the right to self-determination
 isliye ham kehete hai ki ham paristhitiyon ke das nahin he, balki un paristhitiyon ke prati hamaari maansik pratikriya hi hamaare charitra kaa nirmaan karti he
 When our decisive consciousness becomes fully aware and recognizes our moral ideals, we do not care for the circumstances at all
 aatm-nirnay kaa yah adhikaar ishwar ne har manushya ko diya he
 We have to make the final decision ourselves
 ham apane maalik aap hai; apana charitra swayan banaate hai
 Otherwise, there should be no struggle in life; Circumstances make our character itself, our life becomes a slave to external events like a puppet
 saubhaahgya se aisa nahin he
 Man himself is his master
 apana charitra vah swayan banaata he
 For character-building, he needs to use the power of self-determination, not to make situations favorable or strong
 kintu aatmanirnay kii shakti kaa prayog tabhi hoga, yadi ham aatma ko is yogya rakhane kaa ytn karte rahenge ki vah nirnay kar sake
 The right of decision can be exercised only if the powers acting under it are in its control
 shaasha apane nirnay kaa prayog tabhi kar saktaa he, yadi apni praja uske vash main ho
 Similarly, if our natural instincts are under our control, then only we will be able to make self-determination
 ek bhi pravriti vidrohi ho jaae, swatantra vihaar shuru kar de to hamaari sampoorn naitik vyavastha bhang ho jaaegi
 Therefore our natural instincts are the biggest enemy of our character
 unhen vash main kiye bina charitra-nirmaan kaa kaary prarambh nahin ho saktaa
 Before starting a moral life, we have to take their reins in our hands
 unhen vyavastha main laana hoga
 It does not mean that those tendencies have to be killed
 unhen maarna na to sambhav hi he or na hamaare jivan ke liye abhisht hi
 We have to change their direction and put them into creative works
 ve pravritiyaan us jaldhara kii tarah hai jise niyantran main laakar khet seenche ja sakate hai, vidyut bhi paidaa kii ja sakati he or jo aniyantrit rahakar bade-bade nagaron ko bhi barabaad kar sakati he
 The restraint of these tendencies is the basis of character
 sanyam ke bina manushya shuddh vichaar nahin kar saktaa, pragnavan nahin ban saktaa
 It has been said in the Gita that the instincts of the senses are under their control - that one's wisdom is respected
 pragna to sabhi manushyon main he
 Man's gift is the gift of wisdom
 kintu pratishthitprajna yaa sthitprajna vahi hoga jisaki pravritiyaan uske vash main hongi
 Such strong wisdom is the right to self-determination
 yahi pragna he jo paristhitiyon kii daastaa sweekaar na karke manushya kaa charitra banaati he
 One whose wisdom will not be able to subdue natural tendencies and subjectivities, he can never become a true personality
 yah baat samaran rakhni chahie ki ham buddhi ke bal par hi pravritiyon kaa sanyam kar sakate hai
 When the storm of instincts comes in the sea of life, only the mast of intellect surpasses us
 vishyon ko maine aandhi kaha he, inamen aandhi kaa veg he or inako kaabo karnaa bada kathin he—isiilie yah kaha he
 Otherwise, they do not have a transient moment of storm
 pravritiyon ke rup main ye vishay sadaa manushya main rahete hai
 In the same way as a wind, a thunderstorm resides in the sky
 vahi pawan jab kuch akashi tattvon ke vishesh sammilan ke kaaran teevr ho jaataa he, to aandhi ban jaataa he
 Our tendencies are also intensified by intense mixing of emotions, intense lusts are formed
 unka purna daman nahin ho saktaa
 They can be instilled in the welfare directions by the intellect, they can be controlled
 sanyam shabd jitna saadhaaran ho gaya he use kriyaatmak safalataa dena utana hi kathin kaam he
 There are reasons for this difficulty
 sabase mukhya kaaran yah he ki jin pravritiyon ko ham sanyat karnaa chaahate hai ve hamaari swaabhaavik pravritiyaan he
 He was born when we were born
 ham unamem anayas pravrutt hote hai
 So they are very simple
 iske atirikt unka astitv hamaare liye aavashyak bhi he
 Without those tendencies we cannot attempt anything
 unke bina ham nishkarm ho jaaenge; nishkarm hi nahin, ham asurakshit bhi ho jaaenge
 Every natural tendency is the message of this protection and inspiration
 udhaaharan ke liye bhay kii bhaavana ko lijie
 We are afraid only when we find ourselves unable to fight against any adverse powerful person or situation
 us samay bhay kii bhaavana hriday main jaagti he or hamen kaise bhi ho, bhagkar chhipakar yaa kisi bhi chal-bal dwaara apni raksha karne ko prerit karti he
 If we do not take any kind of escape like this, then wash your hands or get into some trouble
 bhay hamen aanevaale vinaash se saavdhaan karata he
 Fear only tells us to change this path and take a new path
 ham kuch der ke liye saham jate hai
 Immediately, people get the support of a new path and escape from the causes of fear
 unhen apni paristhiti kii kathinaaiyon kaa nayaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 Thinking calmly on those new difficulties and think of new solutions
 at: bhay ke hitkaari prabhaav se ham inkaar nahin kar sakate hai
 But considering this effect as temporary, it is only appropriate to give it momentary importance
 yadi yah bhay hamaare swabhaav main aa jaae to ham sadaa asafal hone kii bhaavana se grast ho jaaenge
 Fear should be a reflection of momentary failure and the inspiration for a new industry
 nai prerana se man main nayaa utsaah paidaa hoga
 Just as the lion retreats and attacks, man bends down to leap high, similarly after taking new vigor and new signal from fear, when he resolves to make new effort, then fear will run away
 nirantar asafalataa or pratikultaaon se yuddh karne kii ashktata hamaare bhay ko sthaayee bana detii he
 Then we start to be afraid of even the smallest adversity
 agyaanavash ham in bhayprad paristhitiyon ko or bhi vishaal rup dete jate hai
 Our ignorance becomes the companion of our fears, who do not know the scientific reason for the lightning in the clouds, they imagine that two supernatural demons are fighting with giant mace in the sky
 bijli kaa bhay unke liye ajey ho jaataa he
 By assuming the battles of ghosts of many natural phenomena, we always practice the practice of being fearful
 suryagrahan, chandragrahan, pucchaltaara, mahamari aadi bhautik ghatnaayen bhayanak maani jaati thim
 Since science has proved that these events are not destructive to humans, many fears of the world have been resolved
 kintu jin vaigyanikon ne manushya ko in mithyaa bhayon se chhutkaaraa dene kaa ytn kiya tha unhen mrityu-dand tak diya gaya tha
 The thing is that this feeling of fear motivates man to have faith in some supernatural powers
 shraddha main anand he
 The same joy comes in reverence for the things that create fear
 isliye hamen apana bhay bhi anandaprad ho jaataa he
 These feelings of human beings that make him weak, when he becomes auspicious, then it should be understood that our disease has become incurable if not incurable
 bhay se bachane ke upaay sochane ke sthaan par manushya jab bhay kii puja shuru kar de to bhay se mukti kii aashaa bahut kam rah jaati he
 At that time the tendency of fear engulfs the human being
 hamaara dhyey yah he ki manushya bhay kii pravriti ko vash main karen, na ki vah uskaa gulam ban jaae
 How man becomes a slave to the instinct of fear is also a psychological study
 agar ek pagal kutta aapkaa peechha karata he to nishchay hi aapako us kute se dar lagane lagata he or aapako usase darane kii aadat bhi pad jaati he
 This habit is rational
 iskaa itnaa hi matlab he ki aapako pagal kute ko kaabo main karne kaa upaay maaloom nahin he
 But when you start getting fear from other dogs too, then understand that the habit of fear has started to subdue you
 jab tak aapako duusare kutton ke pagal hone kaa nishchay na ho tab tak aapako bhayaatur nahin hona chahie
 But it has been seen that the weak hearted men start to fear all the dogs after being afraid of the mad dog
 yah dar badhata-badhata yahaan tak pahunch jaataa he ki use chaupaye se dar laganaa shuru ho jaataa he
 If this fear is not tamed, then it starts to feel fear from everything related to the dreaded thing
 mere ek mitra kaa ek baar andhere kamare main kisi chiz se sir takaraa gaya
 After that, they started to fear not only that thing but also from the darkness
 bhayaavah vastu ke saath uski yaad dilaanevaali har chiz se dar lagane lagata he
 This area of fear increases greatly and its effect also becomes permanent on the human character
 durbhaagya se yadi use bhayjanak anek paristhitiyon main se ek saath guzarana padataa he to vah sadaa ke liye bhaybheet ho jaataa he; jivan kaa har kshan mrityu kaa sandesh detaa he; hawa kii madhur maramar main tufaan kaa bhayankar garjan sunai dene lagata he or patton ke hilne main pralay ke tandav kaa drishy dikhaai detaa he
 He is always gloomy
 aisa vyakti jivan main kabhi safal nahin hota
 For scripture, the scriptures have been pleaded: yah prarthana hi manushya ko abhaydaan nahin de sakati
 God has already given man the means to overcome fear
 jis tarah manushya main pratikulata se darane kii pravriti he, usee tarah pratikultaaon se yuddh karne kii or apni pratishtha rakhane kii pravriti bhi he
 By awakening these tendencies, when a man resolves to conquer fear, he himself becomes fearless
 manushya kii ek pravriti duusari pravriti kaa santulan karti rahati he
 Just as the instincts are natural, the equilibrium is also a natural process
 prakritik avasthaa main yah kaary swayan hota rahata he
 But our life does not go through natural states only
 vigyaan kii krupa se hamaara jivan pratidin aprakritik or visham hota jaataa he
 Our situations keep getting unusual
 hamaara jivan adhik saahasik or vegvan hota jaataa he
 The struggle went on ascending
 jivit rahane ke liye bhi hamen jaan ladaakar koshish kerani padati he
 Only the powerful win in the competition of living
 yogyatam ko hi jeene kaa adhikaar he
 1 - Every ordinary person is afraid of life from this establishment
 yah bhay hamaari nas-nas main samaa gaya he
 Talad is a village in Almora district of Kumaon division under the state of Uttarakhand in Someshwar tehsil of India
 vishwaas badhata hi gaya shivamangala singh suman kii rachana he

 Drama - Prakriti Purusha Kalidas is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Black hole ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 In general relativity, a black hole or a black hole or a Krishna vivar is such an astronomical object with such a powerful gravitational field that nothing can escape the light, including the stretch
 kalenidr ke chaaron ore ghatana kshitij naamak ek seemaa hoti he jisamen vastuen gir to sakati hai parantu baahar kuch nahin aa saktaa
 It is called "black" because it absorbs all the light falling on it and does not reflect anything
 yah ooshmaagatiki main thik ek adarsh krishnika kii tarah he
 Quantum analysis of the black hole shows that they contain temperature and Hawking radiation
 apane adrishy bhitari bhaag ke baavjood, ek kalachhidr anya padaarthon ke saath antah-kriya ke madhyam se apni upasthiti prakat kar saktaa he
 For example, black holes can be detected by the motion of a group of stars orbiting a part of the space that appears empty
 vaikalpik rup se, ek saathi taare dwaara aap apekshaakrit chote kalenidr main gas giraate hue dekh sakate hai
 This gas spirals inwards, heating up to very high temperatures and emits large amounts of radiation that can be detected by telescopes located on Earth or orbiting the Earth
 is tarah ke avlokanon ke parinaam swaroop yah vaigyanik sarv-sammati ubhar kar saamne ai he ki, unke swayan na dikhne ke baavjood, hamaare brahmad main kalenidr astitv rakhte he
 By these methods, scientists have discovered that a radio source called Dhanu a *, located in the center of our galaxy, Kshirmarg, has a giant black hole whose mass is 43 million times the mass of our sun
 saidhantik rup se, kisi bhi maatra kaa padaarth ek kalachhidr ban saktaa he, yadi vah itani jagah ke bheetar sankuchit ho jaay jisaki trigya apni samatuly schvarsscield trigya ke baraabar ho
 Accordingly, the mass of our Sun is 3 km
 m Radius of the earth and 9 mm of the earth It can turn into black hole when inside
 vyaavhaarik rup main electron or neutron aapjatya dabaav ke vipareet na to prithvi or na hi suraj main aavashyak dravyaman he or isliye na hi aavashyak gurutvkarshan bal he
 The minimum mass required for a star to be able to recover from these pressures and to be more compressed is the extent proposed by Tolman - Oppenheimer - Volkoff, which is about three solar masses
 ek kalenidr ko aksar ek aisi vastu rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jiskaa palaayan veg prakaash kii gati se adhik ho
 This picture is qualitatively incorrect but provides a way of understanding the order of magnitude of the radius of the black hole
 palaayan veg vah nunatam gati he jo ek vastu main honi chahie taaki vah vastu rukne se pehle kisi guruttvakarshan strot kii kaksha se bachakar nikal jaye
 The escape velocity on Earth is equal to 11
2 km / s, so no matter what the object is, a bullet or a ball, it must move at least 11
2 km / s to avoid falling back to the surface of the Earth
 neutonian yantriki main palaayan veg kii gananaa hetu, maaniye ki ek baari vastu he jiskaa dravyaman m mul par kendrit he
 a second object with a m { \ displaystyle m} mass starts at a v { \ displaystyle v} speed at a distance of r { \ displaystyle r} from the origin, tries to escape towards the infinity, with exactly the same kinetic energy
 Should be so that it can overcome the potential energy of negative gravity, leaving nothing later: is prakaar, yah jaise jaise r = ∞ { \ displaystyle r= \ infty } ke kareeb aati jaati he vaise vaise isaki gatij urja kam hoti jaati he, antat yah bina kisi gati ke ananthata par pahunch jaati he
 This formula represents the critical migration velocity v { \ displaystyle v} in terms of m { \ displaystyle M} and r { \ displaystyle r}
 lekin yah formula yah bhi kahata he ki v { \ displaystyle v} or m { \ displaystyle M} kii prayek value ke liye, r { \ displaystyle r} kii ek critical value hoti he taaki v { \ displaystyle v} gati vaala ek kan bhaagane maatr main safal rahe: When the velocity is equal to the speed of light, it provides the radius of an imaginary Newtonian dark star, a Newtonian body from which no particle moving at the speed of light can escape
 ek kalenidr kii trigya kii value ke liye sarvaadhik prayukt chalan main, ghatana kshitij kii trigya is neutonian value ke baraabar hoti he
 In general relativity, it is not easy to define r coordinates because of the curved nature of space-time and the selection of different coordinates
 is parinaam ke satya hone ke liye, r kii value ko is prakaar paribhaashit karnaa chahie taaki vakrit antariksh samay main r trigya ek sphier ke a satahi kshetra ko abhi bhi is formula dwaara prakat kiya ja sake a = 4 π r 2 { \ displaystyle A=4 \ pi r^{2}} r kii is paribhaasha se koi arth tabhi nikalataa he jab gurutvkarshan kshetra spherickli samamit ho, taaki vahaan ek ke upar ek kai siyaar hon jinpar ekasmaan gurutvkarshan kshetra ho
 The escape velocity depends on the density of an object to escape its gravitational field; This is the ratio of its mass to volume
 ek kalachhidr tab banataa he jab koi vastu itani ghani ho jaye ki kisi khaas duuri tak prakaash bhi usase bachakar na jane paye, kyonki prakaash kii gati kalenidr ke palaayan veg se kam hogi
 Unlike Newtonian gravity, in general relativity, the light moving away from the black hole does not slow down and turn back
 schvarjaschild trigya abhi bhi vah antim duuri he jahaan se prakaash anantta ke liye batch saktaa he, lekin schvarjaschild trigya se shuru hokar baahar nikalne vaala prakaash waapas nahin aata he, vah baahar hi rahata he
 Inside the Schwarzschild radius, each object moves inwards, somehow to be crushed in the center
 saamaanya saapekshata main, kalachhidr kaa dravyaman kisi gurutveey apurvata) par kendrit rah saktaa he, yah ek bindu, ek challa, ek prakaash kiran, yaa ek sphier ho saktaa he; vartmaan main iske vishay main thik thik jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 There is a circular border around this singularity called the event horizon
 yah ghatana kshitij ko 'waapas lautne kaa sthaan' hota he, ek seemaa jiske pare saare padaarth or vikiran bheetar singhulerity kii taraf khinche chale aate hai
 Centrally, the distance between this singularity and the event horizon is the size of the black hole and is equal to twice the mass in the unit where g and c are equal to 1
 surya ke baraabar dravyaman vaale kalenidr kii trigya lagbhag 3 kimi hoti he
 For distances many times greater than this, the gravitational power of the black hole is exactly equal to the gravitational power of any other body of equal mass, just like the Sun
 isliye yadi surya ko samaan dravyaman vaale ek kalenidr ke parivartit kar diya jaye, grahon kii kakshaen aparivartit rahengi
 There are several types of black holes, which are identified by their specific size
 jab ve ek tara ke gurutvkarshan patan ke kaaran banate hai, unhen taarakeey kalachhidr kaha jaataa he
 The mass of black holes formed at the center of galaxies can be several billion times the solar mass, they are called giant black holes because they are very large
 in donon paimaanon ke bich main kuch madhyavarti kalenidr bhi hote hai jinke dravyaman saura dravyaman ke kai hajaar gune tak hote hai
 Very low-mass black holes that are thought to have formed during the Big Bang in the early history of the universe may still exist and are called primordial black holes
 vartmaan main unka astitv abhi nishchit nahin he
 It is not possible to see a black hole directly
 haalaanki, aasapaas ke paryaavaran par uske guruttviya prabhaav dwaara uski upasthiti kaa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he, khaas kar microkvasar or sakriya gallexic nabhikon dwaara, jahaan paas ke kalenidr main girane vaale padaarth ati garam ho jate hai or eks-re vikiran kii badi maatra chhodte hai
 This observation method enables astronomers to ascertain their existence
 kalenidr ekmaatr aise padaarth hai jo in paimaanon par khare utarate hai or saamaanya saapekshata ke dhaanche ke anuroop hote hai
 The concept of a heavy body so incapable of escaping even light was revealed in a letter written by geologist John Michel to Henry Cavendish in 1783 and published by the Royal Society: 1796 main, ganitagya pierre-simon laplas ne apni kitaab exposishan du system du monde ke pehle or duusare sanskaran main isi vichaar ko badhaava diya tha 
 These "dark stars" were ignored in the nineteenth century, because then it was believed that light was a massless wave and therefore free from the effects of gravity
 aadhunik blike hole avadharana ke vipareet, aisa mana jaataa tha ki kshitij ke peeche kii vastu kaa patan nahin ho saktaa he
 In 1915, Albert Einstein developed his general theory of relativity, he had already proved that gravity actually affects the speed of light
 kuch maheene baad, karl schvarjaschild ne ek bindu drabyaman or ek golakaar dravyaman ke gurutvkarshan kshetra kaa samaadhaan diya, yah dikhaate hue ki ek blike hole kaa astitv siddhanthata sambhav he
 The Schwarzschild radius is now known as the radius of the event horizon of non-rotating black holes, but this fact was not understood at the time, for example Schwarzschild himself did not consider it physical
 johanise droste nen, hendrick lorentz ke ek chaatr, swatantra rup se bindu dravyaman par schvarjaschild ke kuch maheenon ke baad aisa hi samaadhaan diya or iske gunon ke bare main bade paimaane par or adhik likhaa
 In 1930, astronomer Subramanian Chandrasekhar, using general relativity, calculated that the solar mass of a non-rotating body containing electron-generated matter would collapse if it exceeded 1
44
 unke tark kaa arthur edington dwaara virodh kiya gaya tha, jinka vishwaas tha ki koi vastu nishchit rup se is patan ko rokegi
 Eddington was partially right: a slightly dwarf white dwarf star above the Chandrasekhar range would transform into a neutron star after its collapse
 But in 1939, Robert Oppenheimer and his colleagues predicted that due to the reasons given by Chandrasekhar, a star with more than three solar masses would collapse into a black hole
 oppenheimer or unke sah lekhakon ne shwarzschild nirdeshaank pranali kaa upyog kiya, jisane shwarzschild trigya par ganitiya vishistataa ko utpaadit kiya, duusare shabdon main, is sameekaran main istamaal kiye gaye kuch ghatak shwarzschild trigya par anant ho jate the
 This implies that the Schwarzschild radius was the boundary of a "bubble" in which time "stopped"
 yah baahar se dekhne waalon ke liye ek vaid bindu he, lekin andar girane waalon ke liye nahin
 Because of this feature, collapsed stars have been known as "frozen stars" for some time, as an external observer will see the star's surface frozen at the moment the star's collapse falls within the Schwarzschild radius
 Must be taking yah aadhunik blike holon kaa ek gyaat lakshan he, lekin is baat par bal diya janaa chahie ki jame hue taare kii sataha kaa prakaash bahut jaldi redshifted ho jaataa he or blike hole ko bahut jaldi kaale rang kaa bana detaa he
 Many physicists were unable to accept the idea that time halts within the Schwarzschild radius and that people had no interest in the subject for 20 years
 1958 main, david phinkeistein ne edington-phinkelsten nirdeshaank prastut karte hue ghatana kshitij kii avadharana pesh kii, jisane unhen yah sabit karne main sakasham kiya ki schvarjaschild sataha r= 2 m ek vishistataa nahin he balki yah ek adarsh ekaladisha jhilli ke rup main kaary karata he: karnatmak prabhaav ise ek hi disha main paar kar sakate hai
 There was no significant contradiction in this and Oppenheimer's results, but it expanded it by adding a falling observer's viewpoint
 finkelstin samet, abhi tak ke saare siddhant keval gaiyr-chakrit blike holon ko cover karte the
 In 1963, Roy Kerr found the perfect solution for recurring black holes
 isaki chakrit singhulerity ek bindu nahin balki ek challa thi
 After some time, Roger Penrose is able to prove that singularity is found within all black holes
 1967 main, khagolavidon ne pulsar kii khoj kii or kuch varshon ke bheetar yah sabit karne main sakasham ho gayi ki gyaat pulsar, teji se chakrit neutron taare hi hai
 By that time, neutron stars were also confined to theoretical curiosity only
 isliye pulsar kii khoj ne un sabhi ati ghanatv vaali vastuon ke prati ruchi ko jaagrit kiya jinaki sanrachana gurutveey patan se hona sambhav hua hoga
 Physicist John Wheeler is widely credited with coining the term black hole in his public speech Our Universe: Known and Unknown in 1967, more cumulatively as an alternative to the "star that has gravitationally fallen to full collapse"
 in the form of
 haalanki, whealer ne jor diya tha ki sammelan main yah shabd kisi or ne gadha tha or unhone isko keval ek upyogi laghu-shabd ke rup main apanaaya
 The term was also cited in a letter to AAAS by Anne Ewing in 1964: jab kisi bade taare kaa puraa kaa puraa eendhan jal jaataa he to usamen ek jabardast visphot hota he jise supernova kehete hai
 The substance that survives after the explosion slowly starts to shrink and takes the form of a very dense mass called a neutron star
 agar neutron star bahut vishaal he to gurutvkarshan kaa dabaav itnaa hoga ki vah apane hi boj se simatata chalaa jayega or itnaa ghanaa ho jayega ki blike hole ban jayega or shyaam vivar, krishna gart yaa blike hole ke rup main dikhaai degaa
 The No Hair Theorem states that, once established, a black hole has only three independent physical characteristics: mass, charge, and angular momentum
 kinhin do blike hole kii in visheshtaon yaa parameter kii value yadi samaan ho to unke bich bhed karnaa kaaphi dushkar ho jaataa he
 These characteristics are special because they are visible from outside the black hole
 udhaaharan ke liye, anya kisi chargekrit vastu kii hi tarah ek chargekrit blike hole bhi samaan charge ko dur dhakelta he, is tathy ke baavjood bhi ki vidyut or chumbakeey balon ke liye jimmedaar kan photauns, aatanrik kshetra se bachakar nikal nahin pate hai
 The reason for this is the Gauss law, the total electric current exiting a large sphere is always the same and measures the total charge within the sphere
 jab charge blike hole main girtaa he, vidyut kshetra line bani rahati hai or kshitij se baahar kii or jhaankati rahati hai or ye kshetra line girane vaale sabhi padaarthon ke kul charge ko sangrakshit karti hai
 Electric field lines eventually spread uniformly across the surface of the black hole, establishing uniform field line density on the surface
 is sandarbh main blike hole ek aam condkating sphier kii tarah kaam karata he jisaki ek nishchit rasistivity hoti he
 Similarly, the total mass of a sphere containing a black hole can be found using the gravitational analog of the Gauss law, sitting far away from the black hole
 isi tarah, koniya gati ko bahut dur se, guruttviya-chumbakeey kshetra dwaara frem dreging kaa upyog karke mapa ja saktaa he
 When a black hole swallows a substance, its horizon oscillates like a wide membrane with friction, a transient system, until it is finally established
 yah vidyut-chumbakatv yaa gej siddhant jaise anya kshetra siddhant se alag he, jinamein kabhi bhi koi gharshan yaa rasistivity nahin hoti kyonki ve samay palatwaan hote hai
 Because a black hole eventually sets up in a final state with only three parameters, there is no way to avoid losing information about the initial conditions: very little about the gravity and electric field of the black hole
 Be able to provide information lupt jaankaree main ve sabhi chijen shaamil hai jinhen blike hole kshitij se bahut duuri se mapa nahin ja saktaa he, jaise kii, kul beryon number, laptone number, tathaa kan bhautikee ke lagbhag sabhi anya sangrakshit sudo-charge
 From here on, this behavior is so strange that it has been called the 'black hole information loss paradox'
 paaramparik rup se bhi blike hole main jaankaree kaa lupt hona kaaphi ajeeb he, kyonki saamaanya saapekshata ek lagrengian siddhant he jo upar upar se time reversible or hamiltonian prathit hota he
 But the black hole is not reversible due to the horizon: matter can penetrate into it but cannot escape
 ek aam blike hole main samay ke palatney ko white hole kaha gaya he, haalaanki entropy or kwantum makenix yah darshaate hai ki white hole blike hole ke samaan hi hai
 The no-hair theorem makes some assumptions about the nature of our universe and the substances involved, while other assumptions provide different conclusions
 udahaaran ke liye, yadi chumbakeey ekal-dhruvon kaa astitv he, jaisaa ki kuch siddhanton dwaara kaha gaya he, chumbakeey charge ek parmparik blike hole kaa chauthaa maapdand hoga
 Examples of the no-hair theorem are known for the following cases: ye apwaad kabhi kabhi asthir hote hai or kabhi kabhi blike hole se dur nai sangrakshit kwantum sankhyaon tak nahin le jate hai
 This theorem must apply in our four-dimensional and almost flat universe
 saralatam blike hole vah he jiskaa drabyaman he lekin na to charge he or na hi koniya gati
 These black holes are also known as Schwarzschild black holes, named after the physicist Karl Schwarzschild who discovered this solution in 1915
 yah oinstin kshetra sameekaran ke liye khoja jane vaala pehla vishwasaneey or sateek samaadhaan tha or birkhophf prameya ke anusaar yah ekmaatr nirvaat samaadhaan he jo spherickli cymetric he
 This means that there is no visible difference between the gravitational field of such a black hole and the gravitational field of any other spherical object of equal mass
 blike hole ke liye yah lokapriy dharna kii yah apane chaaron ore "prayek vastu ko andar khinchataa rahata he" keval iske kshitij ke paas hi satya baithti he; duuri par, iskaa bahari gurutvkarshan kshetra anivaary rup se saadhaaran baari pindon kii tarah kaa hi hota he
 More common solutions to black holes were discovered in the late 20th century
 reissner-nordastrom metric vidyut charge vaale blike hole kaa varnan karata he, jabaki kerr metric ek chakrit blike hole pradaan karata he
 The Kerr – Newman metric is generally the more prevalent stationary black hole solution, which describes both charge and angular momentum
 haalanki ek blike hole kaa dravyaman koi bhi positive mulya le saktaa he, charge or koniya gati dravyaman dwaara baadhya hote hai
 In natural units, the total charge q { \ displaystyle q \ ,} and the total angular momentum j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} are expected to satisfy the following m dravyaman vaale ek blike hole ke liye
 The black hole that fills this disparity is called extreme
 asamanta kaa ulanghan karne vaale oinstin ke samikarnon ke samaadhaanon kaa astitv he, lekin unamem kshitij nahin he
 These solutions have naked specificity and are considered immaterial, because the cosmic censorship hypothesis rejects this specificity because of the overall gravitational collapse of real substances
 yah sankhyatmak anukritiyon dwaara samarthit he
 Due to the relatively large force of the electromagnetic force, black holes formed by the collapse of stars are expected to retain the neutral charge of the stars
 chakran ko compact vastuon kaa ek saamaanya gun mana gaya he or aisa prathit hota he ki blike hole ke pratyaashee binary X-ray source GRS 1915+105 kii koniya gati apane adhiktam sambhav value ke kareeb he
 Black holes are generally classified according to their mass, independent of the angular momentum j { \ displaystyle j \ ,}
 The size of a black hole determined by the event horizon radius, or the Schwarzschild radius, is proportional to the mass m { \ displaystyle m \ ,}, jahaan r s h { \ displaystyle r_{sh} \ ,} schvarjaschild trigya he or m ⨀ { \ displaystyle M_{ \ bigodot }} surya kaa dravyaman he
 Thus the size and mass of a black hole are simply related, independent of rotation
 is kasuti ke anusaar, blike holon ko is prakaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he: The characteristic of a black hole is the appearance of the event horizon; a space of time beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer
 jaisaa ki saamaanya saapekshata ne bhavishyavaanee kii thi, dravyaman kii upasthiti antariksh-samay ko is prakaar vikrut kar detii he ki kanon ke maarg unhen us dravyaman kii taraf le jate hai
 This deformation becomes so powerful on the incident horizon of the black hole that there is no way to go out
 ek baar koi kan ghatana kshitij ke andar aa jaye, uskaa blike hole ke bheetar janaa avashyambhavi ho jaataa he
 For a spectator standing far away, the clocks near the black hole would seem to move more slowly
 is prabhaav ke kaaran, dur khadaa darshak yah dekhegaa ki blike hole main girane vaali koi vastu uske ghatana kshitij ke nikat aane par dhimi ho jaati he, us tak pahunchne ke liye anant samay leti hui prathit hoti he
 At the same time all the actions of this object slow down, resulting in the light appearing more red and dim, this effect is called gravitational red shift
 ant main, girane vaali vastu itani maddham ho jaati he ki dikhaai dena band ho jaati he, ek bindu par ghatana kshitij par pahunchne se thik pehle
 The Schwarzschild radius limits non-spherical event horizons for non-rotating black holes
 ek vastu kii schvarjaschild trigya dravyaman ke anupaat main hoti he
 Circled black holes have a distorted, nonspherical event horizon
 chunki ghatana kshitij ek bhautik sataha nahin he balki keval ek ganitiya paribhaashit seemaa he, padaarth yaa vikiran ko blike hole main pravesh karne se rokane vaala kuch bhi nahin he, keval baahar nikalne se inako roka jaataa he
 The description given by general relativity for black holes is an approximation and it is expected that quantum gravity effects become important from near the event horizon
 yah, blike hole ke ghatana kshitij ke nikat padaarth ke prekshan ko, saamaanya saapekshata or uske prastaavit vistaaron ke adhyayan ko sambhav banaata he
 Although black holes themselves do not radiate energy, electromagnetic radiation and matter particles can radiate from outside the event horizon, via Hawking radiation
 singhulerity blike hole ke centre main hoti he, jahaan padaarth main dabane ke kaaran anant ghanatv ho jaataa he, gurutvkarshan khinchaav anant shaktishaalee hota he or antariksh-samay main anant vikruti hoti he
 This means the mass of a black hole is completely compressed into a region with zero volume
 blike hole ke centre main is shunya-aaytan, anant rup se saghan kshetra ko gurutveey singhulerity kaha jaataa he
 The singularity of a non-rotating black hole is zero in length, width, and height; The singularity of a rotating black hole is ring-shaped and is located on the plane of rotation
 challe main koi motaai nahin hoti isliye koi aaytan nahin hota
 The presence of singularity in general relativity is generally considered an indication of the principle not being applied
 haalaanki yah apekshit he; yah aisi paristhiti main ghatit hota he jahaan kwantum yantric prabhaavon ko inkaa varnan karnaa chahie tha, ati ucch ghanatv or kan sahabhaagitaaon ke kaaran
 Until now it has not been possible to combine the effects of quantum and gravity in one theory
 aam taur par ummid kii jaati he ki kwantum gurutv ke siddhant main singulerity rahit blike hole honge
 The photon sphere is a spherical boundary of zero thickness where the photons will be trapped in a circular orbit, moving along the tangent of the sphere
 anavarti blike hole ke liye, photone sphere kii trigya schvarjaschild trigya kii 1
5 guna hoti he
 These orbits are dynamically unstable, so any small disturbance will also grow larger over time and either throw it beyond the black hole or push it within the event horizon
 haalaanki prakaash abhi bhi photone sphere ke andar se batch saktaa he, koi prakaash jo andar kii or jaati prakshepan path se photone kshetra ko paar karti he us par blike hole kaa kabja ho jaayegaa
 Therefore any light that reaches an audience standing outside from inside the photon sphere must have been emitted by an object outside the photon sphere but beyond the event horizon
 neutron taron jaisi anya compact vastuon main bhi photone sphere ho sakate hai
 This is based on the fact that the gravitational field of an object does not depend on its actual size, so an object that is smaller than 1
5 times the Schwarzschild radius would actually have a photon sphere corresponding to the object's mass
 chakrit blike hole chaaron taraf se argosphior namak ek antariksh-samay kshetra se ghira hota he jisamen sthir khada hona asambhav he
 This is the result of a process called frame-dragging; General relativity predicts that any rotating mass will try to stretch the space-time around itself
 chakrit drabyaman ke paas kii koi bhi vastu chakra kii disha main ghoomana shuru kar degi
 For a rotating black hole, its impact becomes so strong near the event horizon that an object would have to move faster than the speed of light in the opposite direction just to stand still
 ek blike hole kaa argosphior nimnlikhit se ghira hota he: Within the ergosphere, space-time is drawn at a greater speed than light - in general relativity physical objects are forbidden to move faster than light, but space-time zones allow them to be compared to other space-time regions i can walk faster than light
 vasteen or vikiran, centre main gire bina argosphior ke bheetar kaksha main rah sakati hai
 But they cannot hover, because this would require them to travel faster than light backwards, compared to their own space-time zone, which is moving faster than light compared to an outside viewer
 vasteen or vikiran bhi argosphior se batch kar nikal sakate hai
 In fact, the Penrose process predicts that objects will sometimes fly out of the agosphere, for this they will gain energy by "stealing" some of the black hole's energy
 agar vastuon ke kul drabyaman kaa bada bhaag is tarah batch nikalataa he, blike hole kii ghoomane kii gati or dhimi pad jaayegi or antat shaayad ghoomana band bhi ho jaye | The fascinating image of the black hole is bound to raise the question of whether such bizarre objects actually exist, or are they merely imaginary solutions to the Einstein equations
 oinstin kii swayan kr yah galat dharna thi ki blike holon kaa nirmaan sambhav nahin he, kyonki unka vishwaas tha ki patan kii ore agrasar kanon kii koniya gati unki chaal ko sthirataa pradaan karegi
 Because of this, the general relativity community continued to dismiss its opposing results for many years
 lekin unamem se kuch is vishwaas par kaayam rahe ki blike hole kaa astitv vastav main he, or 1960 ke dashak ke ant tak ve adhikansh shodhakartaaon ko yah vishwaas dilaane main safal rahe ki ghatana kshitij kaa nirmaan vaaki main sambhav he
 Once upon a time, Roger Penrose proved that there must be some form of syngularity within him
 iske kuch hi samay pashchaat, stephen hawking ne yah darshaya ki big baing ke kai brahmadia samaadhaanon main singulerity kaa astitv he, scaler kshetron or anya videshi padaarthon kii anupasthiti main 
 The Kerr solution, the no-hair theorem, and the laws of black hole thermodynamics showed that the physical characteristics of a black hole are simple and easily understandable, making them respected research subjects
 aisa mana jaataa he ki blike holon ke nirmaan kii praathmik prakriya taron jaisi baari vastuon kaa guruttviya patan rahi hogi, lekin kai anya prakriyaayein bhi hai jo blike hole ke nirmaan kii taraf le ja sakati hai
 Gravitational collapse occurs when the internal pressure of an object is insufficient to resist its own gravity
 taron main yah aamtaur par isliye hota he kyonki yaa to taron main apane taapmaana ko banaae rakhane ke liye "eendhan" aparyaapt he, yaa ek tara jo sthir tha use dher saare atirikt padaarth mili parantu uske crod kaa taapmaana nahin badhaa
 In both cases, star temperature would prove insufficient to prevent its collapse under its own weight
 is patan ko taare ke ghatakon ke aapjatya dabaav dwaara roka ja saktaa he, padaarth ek aakarshak ghani avasthaa main sanghanit ho jaataa he
 The result is a type of compact star
 What type of compact star will form will depend on the mass of the residue - the residuals have decimated the outer surfaces after the changes caused by the collapse
 note karen ki yah mul taare se kaaphi kam hoga- 5 se adhik saura drabyaman vaale avasheshon kaa utpaadan aise taron se hota he jinka dravyaman patan se pehle 20 se adhik rahaa hoga
 If the mass of the residue exceeds ~ 3-4 solar masses - because the original star was either too heavy or the residue has collected additional mass) - the neutron's inelastic pressure is also insufficient to prevent collapse
 iske baad aisi koi gyaat prakriya nahin he jo is patan ko roak sake or vastu patit ho kar blike hole main tabdeel ho jaayegi
 This gravitational collapse of heavy stars is attributed to the formation of most stellar mass black holes
 gurutveey patan ke liye bahut adhik ghanatv kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In the current age of the universe, this high density is found only in stars, but in the early universe the density was much higher soon after the Big Bang, which may have made the creation of black holes possible
 ucch ghanatv akele ek blike hole ke nirmaan ke liye paryaapt nahin he kyonki drabyaman kaa samaan vitaran, drabyaman ko ikattha hone kii anumati nahin degaa
 For the formation of ancient black holes in this dense medium, it is necessary to have initial cubic disturbances that can later grow under the influence of their own gravity
 praarambhik brahmad ke vibhinn modelon main in gadbadiyon ke aakaar ke bare main vyapak matbhed he
 Various models predicted the creation of black holes, ranging from Planck masses to hundreds of thousands of solar masses
 atah aadim blike hole kisi bhi prakaar ke blike hole ke nirmaan kaa kaaran ho sakate hai
 Gravitational collapse is not the only process that can create a black hole
 siddhant rup main, blike hole kaa nirmaan ucch urja takkaron main bhi sambhav he jo paryaapt ghanatv paidaa karti hai
 However, so far, no such phenomenon has been detected, either directly or indirectly, as a lack of oscillating equilibrium in particle accelerator experiments
 iskaa arth yah nikalataa he ki blike hole ke dravyaman ke liye ek nichali seemaa honi chahie
 Theoretically, this limit should be around the Planck mass, where it is expected that quantum effects would prove the theory of general relativity to be false
 is kaaran prithvi yaa uske aas paas blike hole ke nirmaan kii sambhaavna ko bilkul nakaara ja saktaa he
 However, some developments in quantum gravity suggest that the limit of this bond may be considerably lower
 udahaaran ke liye, kuch brinworld paridrishy plank dravyaman ko kaaphi neeche rakhte hai, shaayad 1 tev / c2 itnaa neeche tak
 This may allow the creation of microscopic black holes in high-energy collisions or large Hadron colliders of the CERN
 haalaanki ye saare siddhant kaaphi kaalpanik hai or kai vaigyaniko kaa mat he ki in prakriyaaon main blike hole kaa nirmaan sambhav nahin he
 Black holes, once formed, continue to develop by absorption of additional substances
 saare blike hole antartaarkeey dhul or sarvyaapee vikiran ko lagaataar avashoshit karte rahenge, lekin inamen se kisi bhi prakriya kaa ek taarakeey blike hole ke dravyaman par koi khaas prabhaav nahin padataa he
 More significant contributions occur when a black hole is formed in a binary star system
 nirmaan ke baad blike hole apane saathi se kaaphi maatra main padaarth avashoshit kar saktaa he
 Extremely large contributions occur when a black hole merges with other stars or compact objects
 adhikansh akashgangaon ke centre main sthit ati vishalkay blike holon kaa nirmaan sambhawatah kai choti vastuon ke vilay ke dwaara hua hoga
 The same process has also been proposed to form some intermediate-mass black holes
 jaise jaise ek vastu ghatana kshitij kii taraf babbti he, kshitij phoolnaa aarambh kar detaa he or lapak kar usko nigal letaa he
 Shortly thereafter, the expansion of the radius is evenly distributed throughout the hole
 1974 main, stephen hawking ne dikhaaya ki blike hole puri tarah se kaale nahin hai, balki ye thodi maatra main tapiya vikiran bhi nikaalte hai
 They found this result using quantum field theory in a stable black hole background
 unke samikarnon kaa parinaam yah he ki ek blike hole ko kanon ko ek adarsh blike body spectrum main chhodana chahie
 This effect became known as Hawking radiation
 hawking parinaam ke baad se, kaiyon nen vibhinn tareekon ke madhyam se is prabhaav ko satyapit kiya he
 If this theory of black hole radiation is correct, then it is expected that the black holes will remove the thermal beam of radiation and this will cause the mass to decay, since according to the theory of relativity, the mass is just the high condensed energy
 Over time, black holes will shrink and fly in the air
 is kiranpunj kaa taapmaana blike hole ke satahi gurutvkarshanake anupatik rahata he, jo badale main dravyaman ke liye vipareet rup main anupaatik rahata he
 Hence larger black holes emit less radiation than smaller black holes
 5 saura drabyaman vaale ek taarakeey blike hole kaa hawking taapmaana kareeb 12 nanokelvins hota he
 This is much lower than the 2
7K produced by the space micro-wave background
 taarakeey dravyaman vaale blike hole hawking vikiran ke madhyam se jitna drabyaman chhodte hai usase adhik dravyaman ve cosmik microwave prishthbhumi se praapt kar lete hai, atah ve sikudne kii bajaay failte jate hai
 To achieve Hawking temperatures higher than 2
7 K, a black hole would have to be lighter than the Moon
 duusari taraf yadi ek blike hole bahut chota he, ummid kii jaati he ki uskaa vikiran kaa prabhaav bahut shaktishaalee ho jaayegaa
 a black hole that is even heavier than humans will vanish in a moment
 ek car ke vajan vaala blike hole ko vashpit hone ke liye maatr ek nanosecond kaa samay hi lagegaa, is dauraan kuch kshanon ke liye isaki chamak surya se 200 guna se bhi adhik ho jaayegi
 Light black holes are expected to evaporate even faster, for example a black hole with 1 tev / c 2 mass will take less than 10–88 seconds to completely disappear
 beshak, itane chote blike hole ke liye kwantum gurutv prabhaav se ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane kii ummid kii jaati he or yahan tak ki – haalaanki kwantum gurutv main hue haal ke vikaas is ore koi sanket nahin karte hai – parikaalpanik taur par aise chote blike hole sthir honge
 The presence of most accretion disks and gas jets is not a clear evidence of the presence of stellar mass black holes, as other more massless and very dense objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs can cause and create accretion disks and gas currents
 The behavior is the same as that around a black hole
 lekin ve aksar khagolavidon kii yah batalaakar madad kar sakati hai ki kis jagah blike hole kii talash faldaayi siddh ho sakati he
 But on the other hand, supermassive accretion disks and gas currents can be a good proof of the presence of a highly soluble black hole, because as far as we know, only one black hole can be the cause of these phenomena
 sthir eks-re or gamma kiran utsarjan bhi kisi blike hole kii maujuudagi sabit nahin karte hai, lekin khagolavidon ko yah bataa sakate hai ki kahan khoj karnaa faldaayi hoga- or inaki ye khubi hoti he ki ve kaaphi aasaani se nabulai or gas ke badalon se nikal pate hai
 But powerful, irregular X-rays, gamma rays and other electromagnetic radiation can help prove that that massive, super-dense object is not a black hole, so that the "black hole hunter" is focused on another object Can do
 neutron taron or anya ati saghan taron par satahen hoti hai or padaarthon kaa prakaash kii gati ke ek ucch pratishat par sataha ke saath takaraav, aniyamit antaraalon par vikiran kii gahan lapaton kaa utsarjan karata he
 The black hole has no solid surface, so the absence of intense flames of radiation at irregular intervals around a very densely compact object indicates that there may be a good chance of a black hole
 gahan parantu ek hi baar gamma kiran kaa nikalnaa kisi "nae" blike hole ke janm kaa sanket ho saktaa he, kyonki khagol-bhautikavidon kaa vichaar he ki grbs kaa kaaran yaa to kisi vishaal taare kaa gurutveey patan he athwa neutron taron ke bich takaraav, or in donon ghatnaon main blike hole kaa srijan karne hetu paryaapt drabyaman or dabaav shaamil hota he
 But it appears that a collision between a neutron star and a black hole can also produce a GRB, so a GRB is not evidence that a "new" black hole has formed
 sabhi gyaat GRB hamaari apni akashganga ke baahar se aate hai or adhikansh arabon prakaash varshon kii dur se aate hai isliye inase jude blike hole vastav main arabon varsh puraane hai
 Some space-physicists believe that some super bright X-ray sources may be the accretion disks of intermediate-mass black holes
 aisa mana jaataa he ki kasaar atyadhik drabyaman vaale blike hole kii abhivruddhi discs hai, kyonki ab tak gyaat koi bhi vastu itani shaktishaalee nahin he jo itnaa shaktishaalee utsarzan kar sake
 Quasars produce powerful emissions throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, including UV, X-rays and gamma-rays, and are also visible from a considerable distance due to their high brightness
 5 se 25 pratishat ke bich kasaar "radio laud" hote hai, yah sangya inke shaktishaalee radio utsarjan ke kaaran he
 a gravitational lens is formed when rays of light coming from a far away bright source are "twisted" around a giant object, between the viewer and the source object
 This process is known as gravitational lensing and is one of the predictions of general relativity theory
 is siddhant ke anusaar, drabyaman gurutvkarshan kshetron ko banane ke liye antariksh-samay ko "samete" rahata he or isliye parinamswaroop prakaash ko mode detaa he
 The image of the source behind the lens can appear to an observer as multiple images
 yadi strot, baari lencing vastu or paryvekshak ek sidhi rekha main hon, strot baari vastu ke peeche ek challe ke rup main dikhaai degaa
 Gravitational lensing can also be caused by objects other than black holes, because any very powerful gravitational field has the ability to bend light rays
 in bahu chhaviyon vaale prabhaavon main se kuch, sambhawatah sudur sthit akashgangaon ke kaaran nirmit hote hai
 Objects orbiting a black hole continue to explore the gravitational field surrounding the central object
 1970 ke dashak main khoja gaya, ek purana udhaaharan he, ek prasiddh eksre strot signs X-1 ke liye jimmedaar kalpit blike hole ke ird-gird parikrama karti abhivruddhi discs
 Although the matter itself cannot be seen directly, the flickering of the x-ray continues in milliseconds, as expected just before accretion from a hot mass-like material orbiting around a black hole of about ten solar masses
 Is performed
 eksre spectrum us vishisht aakaar ko darshata he jisaki apeksha us discs se kii jaati he jisamen aurbiting relativistic padaarth hon, ek louh rekha ke saath or jise ~6
4 kev par utsarjit kiya gaya ho, tathaa laal or nile kii taraf chaudaa kiya gaya ho
 Another example is the S2 star which is seen orbiting the celestial center
 yah tara ~ 3
5 × 106 saura drabyaman vaale blike hole se kai prakaash ghanton kii duuri par he, isliye isaki parikraman gati ko ankit kiya ja saktaa he
 Nothing is visible in the center of the supervised orbit, as would be expected from a black object
 ardh-aavadhik dolan kaa istamaal blike hole ke dravyaman kaa nirdhaaran karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 This technique uses the relationship between the black hole and the inner part of its surrounding disks, where the gas continues to rotate inward before reaching the event horizon
 jaise hi gas kaa patan bheetar kii ore hota he, yah eksre vikiran prasaarit karata he jisaki tivrata ek nishchit kram se kam-zyada hoti rahati he or jo ek niyamit antaraal par khud ko doharaata rahata he
 This indicator is called half-period oscillation or QPO
 ek QPO kii aavriti blike hole ke dravyaman par nirbhar karti he; chote blike hole main ghatana kshitij nikat hi sthit hota he, isliye QPO kii aavriti ucch hoti he
 For black holes with greater mass, the event horizon is farther outward, so the QPO frequency is lower
 ab yah vyapak rup se sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki prayek akashganga ke, yaa lagbhag prayek, centre main ek ati vishalkay blike hole hota he
 The close correlation between the mass of this black hole and the rise of the host galaxy indicates that there is a deep correlation between the formation of the galaxy and the black hole
 dashakon tak, khagolavidon ne "sakriy akashganga" shabd kaa istemaal aisi akashgangaon kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya jinamein asaamaanya visheshtaayen hoti thi, jaise ki asaamaanya varnakrameey rekha utsarjan or ati shaktishaalee radio utsarjan
 However, theoretical and observational studies show that the galactic nuclei active in these galaxies may contain supermassive black holes
 in AGN ke modelon main ek kendriya blike hole hota he jo ki suraj se lakhon yaa arabon guna adhik baari ho saktaa he; ek gas or dhul kii discs jise abhivruddhi discs kehete hai; or do dharaaen jo abhivruddhi discs ke lambavat hoti hai
 Although it is expected that supermassive black holes will be found in almost all agns, the nuclei of only a few galaxies have been carefully studied in an effort to both identify and measure the actual mass of central supermassive black hole candidates
 Can be done
 aisi kuch ullekhneey akashgangaon ke udhaaharan hai, andromeda akashganga, M32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, or sombrero akashganga
 Astronomers believe that a supermassive black hole is located in the center of our own galaxy, in an area called Segitarius a *, because: 2002 main, habbal antarikshawya doorabeen ne jo avlokan prastut kiya ve sanket karte hai ki M15 or G1 naamak golakaar samoohon main madhyavarti-dravyaman vaale blike hole ke hone kii sambhaavna he
 This interpretation is based on the size and duration of the orbit of stars in spherical clusters
 lekin habbal saboot nirnaayak nahin he, kyonki neutron taron kaa ek samooh is tarah ke avlokanon kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Until recent discoveries, many astronomers thought that complex gravitational interactions in spherical clusters would expel newly formed black holes
 november 2004 main, khagolavidon kii ek team ne hamaari akashganga ke pratham or purnatah satyapit madhyavarti-dravyaman vaale blike hole kii khoj kii soochna di, jo segiterius A* se 3 prakaash varsh dur parikrama kar rahaa he
 This black hole, with a mass of 1300 solar masses, is in the middle of a group of seven stars, possibly a remnant of a massive star cluster that has fallen from the center of the Ganges
 yah avlokan is baat kii pushti karata he ki ati vishalkay blike hole aasapaas ke chote blike holon or taron ke avasorana dwaara apni vruddhi karte he
 In January 2007, researchers at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom reported the discovery of a black hole, possibly containing 10 solar masses and located in a galaxy called NGC 4472, at a distance of about 55 million light years
 hamaari akashganga main kai sambhavit taarakeey-dravyaman vaale blike hole shaamil hai, jo sagiterius A* kshetra ke ati vishalkay blike hole kii tulana main hamase adhik najadik hai
 All of these candidates are members of X-ray binary systems in which a more dense object draws substances from its partner through an accretion disk
 in jodon main blike hole teen se lekar ek darjan se zyada saura dravyamanon ke ho sakate hai
 The hitherto observable stellar mass black hole, Messia is a member of the binary system located in 33 galaxies
 siddhanthata ek blike hole ke liye koi nunatam aakaar tay nahin he
 Once they are created, they have the properties of black holes
 stephen hawking ne pratipaadit kiya ki atipraarambhik blike hole vashpit ho kar or bhi sookshm ho sakate hai, arthath sookshm blike hole
 The Fermi gamma-ray Space Telescope is being proposed for the discovery of a supermassive black hole that evaporates, which was launched on 11 June 2008
 haalaanki, agar sookshm blike hole kaa nirmaan duusare tareekon se ho saktaa he, jaise ki antarikshawya kiran ke prabhaav se yaa coliders main, iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki unhen nishchit rup se vashpit ho janaa chahie
 The formation of analogs of black holes in particle accelerators on Earth is reported
 ye blike hole anuroop gurutveey blike hole ke samaan nahin hote hai, lekin gurutv pramaatra siddhanton kii jaanch ke liye ye mahatvapurn hai
 They behave like black holes, which have nothing to do with gravity and the quantum theory of gravity, in line with the theory of strong nuclear power
 ve samaan hai kyonki donon string siddhant dwaara varnit kiye jate hai
 Therefore, the formation and dissolution of fire spheres in quark gluons plasma can be explained in the language of black holes
 rileytivistik haivi aayan colider main aag kaa gola parighatna blike hole ke kaaphi nikat kaa anuroop he or is anuroop kaa upyog karke iske kai bhautik gunon kii bhavishyavaanee sahi dhang kii ja sakati he
 a fireball, however, is not a gravitational object

 For a more in-depth discussion, see: Particle collision protection in the Large Hadron Collider
 saamaanya saapekshata main aise vinyas kii sambhaavna kaa varnan kiya gaya he jisamen do blike hole ek duusare se jude hue hai
 Such a configuration is usually called a wormhole
 varmholon ne kalpit vigyaan kathaon ke lekhakon ko prerit kiya he kyonki ve ati lambi duuri kii yatraaon ko shighrata se tay karne kaa saadhan pradaan karte hai, time travel bhi
 In practice, such configurations are almost impossible in astrophysics, as no known process seems to allow the creation of these objects
 1971 main, stephen hawking ne dikhaaya ki paaramparik blike hole ke kisi bhi sangrah ke ghatana kshitij ke kul kshetra ko kam nahin kiya ja saktaa he, bhale hi ve aapas main takaraa kar ek duusare ko nigal len, arthath vilay ho jaae
 This is remarkably similar to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, where the field plays the role of entropy
 aisa mana jaataa tha ki shunya taapmaana hone kii vajah se blike hole kii entropy shunya hogi
 If this were the case, the entry of entropy-rich matter into the black hole would have violated the second law of thermodynamics, resulting in a decrease in the total entropy of the universe
 isliye, jacob bekensten ne prastaav rakhaa ki ek blike hole kii ek entropy chahie or ise ghatana kshitij kaa anupaatik hona chahie
 Since black holes traditionally do not emit radiation, the thermodynamic approach seems to be consistent, as zero temperature means infinite changes in entropy by any sum of heat, which means infinite entropy
 haalaanki, 1974 main, hawking ne ghatana kshitij ke paas pramaatra kshetra siddhant ko vakrit antariksh-samay par lagu kiya or paaya ki blike hole hawking vikiran chhodte hai, jo ek tarah kaa tapiya vikiran he or unru prabhaav se sambaddh he, jiskaa arth yah niklaa ki unamem ek saakaratmak taapmaana nihit he
 This reinforced the simulation between black hole dynamics and thermodynamics: using the first law of black hole mechanics, it can be concluded that the entropy of a non-rotating black hole will be one-fourth of the area of its event horizon 
 yah ek saarvbhaumik parinaam he or ise sampoorn brahmadia kshitij par lagu kiya ja saktaa he, jaise kii di citter antariksh kshetra main
 Later it was suggested that a black hole is an object with maximum entropy, that is, the maximum possible entropy of a single region of space would be the entropy of the largest black hole that can be contained in that region
 isaki vajah se holographic siddhant kii utpatti hui
 Hawking radiation refers to the specific temperature of a black hole, which can be calculated from its entropy
 taapmaana jitna giregaa, blike hole utana hi vishaal hota jaayegaa: jitani adhik urja avashoshit karegaa, utana hi adhik adhik thanda hota jaayegaa
 a black hole with approximately the mass of the planet Mercury has a temperature in equilibrium with celestial micro-wave radiation
 isse adhik baari hone par, ek blike hole prishthbhumi vikiran se adhik thanda ho jayega or yah hawking vikiran ke madhyam se utsarjit urja kii tulana main, prishthbhumi se zyada teji se urja praapt karegaa, isse bhi adhik thanda ho jaayegaa
 However, in a less massive black hole this effect would indicate that the mass of the black hole evaporates slowly over time, while the black hole will continue to heat up while doing so
 haalaanki ye prabhaav un blike hole ke liye naganya hai jo antarikshawya rup se gathit hone ke liye paryaapt rup se baari hai, ve kaalpanik chote blike hole ke liye badi teji se mahatvapurn ho jaayenge, jahaan pramaatra-yantric prabhaav haaavee hon
 In fact, small black holes will probably evaporate at a rapid rate and eventually disappear with an explosion of radiation
 haalanki saamaanya saapekshata kaa upyog kisi blike hole kii entropy kii gananaa hetu kiya ja saktaa he, yah sthiti siddhanthata santushti dene vaala nahin he
 In statistical mechanics, entropy is understood as the calculation of the number of microscopic configurations of a system that have similar microscopic properties
 lekin ek pramaatra gurutv ke santoshjanak siddhant ke bina, blike hole ke liye is prakaar kii gananaa karnaa sambhav nahin he
 However, little hope has been aroused by string theory, according to which the microscopic amount of freedom of a black hole is D-branes
 pradaan kiye gayi charge or urja dwaara di-brans kii avasthaaon kii gananaa karke, kuch khaas ati samamit blike hole ke utkram maap ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Extending the field of validity of these calculations is an ongoing area of research

 Traditionally, the laws of physics will remain the same, move forward or backward

 The Louville theorem describes the conservation of the phase space volume, which can be understood as "conservation of information", so there is a problem in established physics as well
 kwantum yantriki main, yah kendrikaran naamak ek mahatvapurn gun ke saath mail khaati he, jiskaa sambandh prayikta ke sangrakshan ke saath he 
 However, black holes can violate this rule
 sthapit saamaanya saapekshata ke antargat yah sthiti sookshm kintu spasht he: sthapit no-hair prameya ke kaaran, yah kabhi nirdhaarit nahin kiya ja saktaa ki blike hole ke andar kya gaya? haalaanki, baahar se dekhne par, jaankaree vastav main kabhi nasht nahin hoti he, kyonki blike hole main girte hue padaarth ko ghatana kshitij tak pahunchne main anant samay lagata he
 It is necessary to emphasize that the equations of general relativity do in fact follow t-symmetry and that the fact that the above argument comes from the application of general relativity should be a bit cautious
 yah is tathy kii vajah se he ki time-cymetric siddhant dwaara time-reversal-acemmetric nishkarsh tak pahunchaana sambhav nahin he, jo is maamle main saamaanya saapekshata he
 Rindler coordinates, which are applied near the event horizon for an external viewer, are T-symmetric, so the existence of something like an "invariant" process can be ruled out
 yah sambhav he ki "virodhabhas" time-samamit siddhant par time-asamamit seemaa ko lagu karne kaa parinaam he, yah isko loshmit virodhabhas kaa ek prakaar banataa he
 Considerations of quantum gravity, on the other hand, suggest that there may only be a finite finite inverse measurement that will be related to the space near the horizon: but the change in the horizon's entropy and the Hawking radiation's entropy measure are sufficient Happens to contain all the transverse measurements of matter and energy that are falling into a black hole
 haalaanki kai bhautikeevidon kii yah chintaa he ki yah abhi bhi thik prakaar se samajha nahin ja sakaa he
 In particular, at a quantum level, the quantum state of Hawking radiation is determined only by what has previously fallen into the black hole; And the history of what had fallen into a black hole is determined solely by the quantum state of black hole and radiation
 yahi niyatatvvaad or kendrikaran kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 For a long time Stephen Hawking defied the idea, insisting on his original 1975 position that Hawking radiation is completely thermal, therefore completely disorganized, with no information of the material previously ingested by the black hole
 ; He argued that this information has been omitted
 haalaanki, 21 july 2004 main, unhone nayaa tark prastut kiya, apane pichley tark ke vipareet
 In this new calculation, the entropy measurement corresponding to the black hole passes out to the Hawking radiation
 haalaanki, ise siddhant main samaj paanaa bhi mushkil he, jab tak blike hole apana vashpikaran puraa na kar le
 Until then, it is impossible to establish a 1: 1 approach to Hawking radiation information and the initial state of the system
 ek baar jab blike hole puri tarah vashpit ho jaye, unki pahchaan kii ja sakati he or unamem hua kendrikaran sangrakshit rahata he
 By the time Hawking completed his calculations, it was quite clear by the ads / CFT relationship that black holes decay in a unitary way
 kyonki gej siddhanton main aag ke gole, jo hawking vikiran ke anuroop hai, nishchit rup se ekaatmak hai
 Hawking's new calculations have not been evaluated by the expert scientific community, because their methods are unintentional and of questionable conformity
 lekin khud hawking ne isapar paryaapt vishwaas jataate hue 1997 main caltech bhautikavid jon preskill ke saath lagaai gayi shart ke liye bhugtan kiya, jisamen media ko kaaphi ruchi rahi thi
 Leonard Saskind and Nobel Prize winner Gerard t Huft have suggested that the three-dimensional space around the black hole can be fully characterized by a two-dimensional behavior of the event horizon
 ve isapar vishwaas karte hai kyonki yah blike hole jaankaree-lop virodhabhas kaa samaadhaan kar saktaa he
 This idea has been adapted under string theory, and is known as holographic theory

 But gradually, the experience of pledging in business relations and the need to give legal recognition to it, along with the decline of values and morals, the society has experienced this and that is why the pledge in moral and spiritual terms has become secondary, following the statutory recognized business utterances Importance gained prominence

 kintu vartmaan sanvida kaa swaroop usase bhinn he, yadhyapi uske vikaas kii kadi unase bhi jodi ja sakati he
 The current contract is characterized by its legal validity
 vah prayek vachan athwa qaraar jo kanoon dwaara pravartaneey ho athwa jiskaa kanoon dwaara paalan karaayaa ja sake, sanvida he
 In ancient times, this legal recognition was not a special force but the emphasis was that if any formality was reduced from its formalities then the contract would not be completed
 yadhyapi apane vibhinn roopon main sanvida kaa prachlan samaaj ke vyavsaayik sambandhon main tha parantu "sanvida" shabd kaa anveshan bahut baad main hua
 The word contract is very broad
 sanvida ke hi ang vikray, rin, bandhak, nikshep, saajhedaari, abhikartrutv, vivaah aadi bhi hai
 But in its present form the contract has assumed new legal meaning
 bharatvarsh main iskaa adhinium san 1872 i

 Therefore, Indian courts are now bound to follow this written law in the case of contract

 apane vartmaan rup main sanvida ek vidhik vachan yaa kanoon dwaara pravartaneey qaraar he
 It has two essential elements - qaraar or Quality of making it effective by law
 jab kam se kam do vyakti kisi kaary ke karne athwa usase virat rahane ke sambandh main ekamat hote hai to use qaraar kaha jaataa he
 The agreement requires at least two parties
 yadi "a" na "ba" se prastaav kiya ki "ba" "a" kaa ek chitra bana de to vah "ba" ko is kaary hetu paanch sau rupe degaa
 This is proposed by "A"
 yadi "ba" yah sweekaar kar le ki paanch saura rupe main vah "a" ke liye uskaa chitra bana degaa to yah ek aisa qaraar hua jo kanoon dwaara pravartaneey he or use prabhavakaari banaaya ja saktaa he
 That is, a person cannot make an agreement alone, it is necessary for the agreement to have the mental unity of the common side on the matters related to the agreement
 taatpary yah he ki qaraar sambandhi prayek baat ke sambandh main ubhay paksh uskaa ek hi arth samajhen
 It should not happen that one side understands one meaning and the other side understands the other meaning
 "a" ke paas do motorcarein hai, ek ford or duusari shevarlyt
 He wants to sell his Ford car for five thousand
 usne apni us car ko bechney kaa prastaav "ba" se kiya
 But "B", considering it a "chevrolet" car, agreed to buy it
 yah qaraar nahin hoga kyonki "a" or "ba" main motorcar ke sambandh main maansik ekaatmakataa nahin hui
 "A" from Motorcar understood Ford Motorcar and "B" as Chevrolet Car
 uparyukt kathan se spasht he ki prastaav hi sweekruti ke uparant qaraar banataa he
 There are different types of proposals but generally they are classified into five categories: 1
 vishisht prastaav, jab koi prastaav nishchit vyakti yaa vyaktiyon se kiya jaataa he, tab use vishisht prastaav kehete hai
 Since the offer is made to a certain person or persons, the person accepting it will be called the acceptor
 isamen sweekruti kii soochna swikarta dwaara prastaavak ko dena aavashyak he
 2
 a general proposal is a proposal that is not made by a certain person or persons, but a person of the world can accept it
 isi liye vishisht prastaav kii bhanti isamen sweekruti kii soochna kaa prastaavak ko diya janaa anivaary nahin hota
 Approval of this proposal is considered to be the only thing that is revealed and desired in the proposal
 3
 spasht prastaav ve prastaav he jo maukhik yaa likhit rup main hri parantu spashtat: hri kiye jaaen
 4
 Indicative proposals These proposals are made not by words but by actions
 yatriyon ko ek sthaan se duusare sthaan ko tikat ke badale le jane kaa prastaav, railgadee ko stesan par aana hi he
 It is also an example of a general proposition because its acceptor is not predetermined
 5
 anwarat prastaav is prastaav main nishchit dar se 5000 man gehun kii aapurti kaa prastaav
 Even after acceptance of this proposal, one party cannot be compelled to buy whole wheat immediately or the other party will sell it
 prastaav kii hi bhanti or uske anuroop sweekruti kii koi vishesh vidhi yaa pranali nirdhaarit karata he, vahaan sweekruti kaa us vidhi yaa pranali nirdhaarit karata he, vahaan sweekruti kaa us vidhi yaa pranali dwaara sweekruti na ho to prastaavak ko usee pranali dwaara sweekruti dene par bal dena chahie
 But where there is no mention of any system or specific method of acceptance, acceptance can be done by any reasonable, relevant and appropriate system
 sweekruti bhi spasht arthath shabdon dwaara ho sakati he athwa sankethik rup main kaary dwaara
 The acceptance of the company's proposal by work is the seating of the passenger on the train going to the destination with the ticket
 keval maansik sweekruti maatr sweekruti nahin samajhi ja sakati
 Its expression in words or by action is also necessary
 prastaav main nirdisht kaaryon kaa karnaa bhi katipay prastaavon kii sweekruti maani jaati he
 But it is necessary that the acceptor knows the conditions of the proposer before doing this work
 yadi swikarta prastaav kii bina jaankaree ke hi vah kaary karata he jo prastaav main nirdisht he, to vah prastaav kii sweekruti nahin mana ja saktaa
 a person Goridutt sent his bookkeeper Lalman to search for his nephew
 lalman ke jane ke uparant gauridatt ne apane bhattije ko khoj laanevaale ke liye 501 rupe puraskaar kii ghoshnaa kii
 Lalman discovered the nephew of Munim Gauridutt and demanded the award
 nirnay yah hua ki chunki lalman ko ladke kii khoj ke purv puraskaar kii shart kii soochna nahin thi, na puraskaar prapti kii baat hi gyaat thi, at: khoe hue ladke ko khoj laane kaa lalman kaa kaary gauridatt ke prastaav kii sweekruti nahin mana ja saktaa Accepting the profit arising from the proposal is also considered to be acceptance of the offer in appropriate conditions
 varanasi se prayag kii bas main baithkar janaa hi bas maalik ke prastaav kii sweekruti he or swikarta bas kaa kiraaya dene ko baadhya he
 Approval should be in the case of the proposal being upheld
 yadi prastaav nishprabhav ho chukaa he yaa prastaavak dwaara khandit kiya yaa waapas liya ja chukaa he to sweekruti bhi nirarthak or prabhaavaheen hogi
 The information of the proposer is required to be accepted by the acceptor and the acceptance of the offer to the proposer
 prastaav kii soochna jab us vyakti ko praapt ho jaae jiske prati prastaav kiya jaataa he tab prastaav kaa sanvahan yaa sanchaar purna samajha he
 "A" sent the letter "B" in his watch 150) by offering to sell "B"
 jyonhi "k" kaa patr "kha" ko praapt hoga, "k" ke prastaav kaa sanvahan purna ho jayega
 Separation is separate for acceptance
 jab swikarta apni sweekruti prastaavak ke paas is prakaar preshit kar de ki uskaa waapas lenaa swikarta ke vash main na rahe, to prastaavak ke viruddh sweekruti prastaavak ke paas pahunch jaae
 In the above example, convection of your acceptance by "B" will be deemed complete but not against the acceptor
 swikarta ke viruddh sweekruti ke viruddh sweekruti kaa sanvahan tab purna hoga jab swikti prastaavak ke paas pahunch jaae
 In the above example, the acceptance of "B" by the letter "B" will be banned against the proposer named "A" but not against the acceptor "B"
 "kha" ke viruddh sanvahan kii purnataa tab hogi jab uski sweekruti kaa patr "k" ko praapt ho jaae
 When the proposer and the acceptor are present in front of each other, there is no complication in the convection, but when both are in two places, the medium of convection is by post or letter
 uparyukt kathan se yah spasht he ki prastaav kaa patr prastaavak dwaara chode jate hi vah purna nahin hota varan swikarta ke paas pahunchan par hi purna hota he
 This also leads to the conclusion that there is no complication in convection if the offeror and the acceptor are present before each other, but until the acceptor leaves their acceptance letter in the post because then the withdrawal of acceptance is outside the confessor's authority
 goes
 swikarta dwaara sweekrutipatr dak main chhodte har prastaav prastaavak ke viruddh purna ho jaataa he
 It has been said above that acceptance is complete against the acceptor when the proposer receives it
 prastaavak ko praapt hone ke purv swikarta apni sweekrutipatr daakkhaane main chode jate ho swikarta ke viruddh bhi purna ho jaataa he
 Acceptance is also effective if it arrives late or gets lost on the way, as it is believed that inadvertence or mistake of the Department of Posts does not justify any effect on the parties to the contract
 parantu yadi sanvahan ke liye patr dak main na daalkar postman ko de diya jaae to yah paryaapt sanvahan nahin kyonki prayek vyakti ke patr ko lekar dak main chhodana postman ke kartavyon main sammilit nahin he
 According to Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act 1872, all such agreements are considered contracts which qaraar karne yogya pakshon kii Be done with independent consent, jinka pratifal or uddeshy vaid ho or jo The Act should not have been declared by the said Act
 isi dhara main yah bhi spasht kar diya gaya he ki uparyukt paribhaasha kaa prabhaav aise kisi kanoon par nahin padegaa, By which a contract must be written, or with the testimony of registered witnesses
 aise sabhi vyakti sanvida karne yogya maane jate hai jo vyask hon, swasth mastishkvaale hon or kisi kanoon dwaara sanvida karne ke ayogy na tehraae gaye hon

 If the deformity is temporary in the person with deformed heart, or if the deformity is temporary in the person with brain, the brain is deformed and sometimes healthy, then such a person is not in the deformal but is a worthy party to the contract in the time of recovery of the brain
 1 The right of the offender to contract at the time of imprisonment is suspended but for the purpose of imprisonment or forgiveness Shchat her ability to contract is retrieving
 diwalia ghoshit vyakti bhi sanvida karne kii yogyata se vanchit mana jaataa he
 a key requirement of the contract is to have independent consent of the parties to the contract
 yadi sahmati swatantra nahin he to sanvida usase prabhavit hogi
 Consent is considered independent when it 1
 balpravartan yaa traas, 2
 unwanted effects, 3
 chhalkapat, 4
 Has not been influenced or received by a misleading statement, or fallacy
 balpravartan yaa traas kii paribhaasha bhartiya sanvida adhinium kii dhara main di gai he
 According to him, there are four forms of force or tragedy: bhartiya dand vidhaan dwaara varjit or dandaneey kaary karnaa yaa Threatening to do, whether or not the place where this act is done or not, kisi bhi vyakti kii sampatti avaidh rup se roak rakhana; athwa Threatening to stop
 is balpravartan yaa traas kaa uddeshy kisi vyakti ko sanvida kaa paksh bananaa hi hona chahie
 The definition of undue influence is given in Section 16 of the Contracts Act
 uske anusaar vah sanvida avaanchit prabhaav dwaara prerit kahi jaati he jiske pakshon ke sambandh aise hon ki ek paksh duusare paksh kii ichha se apni us vishisht sthiti kaa prayog kare
 The relationship between parents and children, guardians and parents, lawyers and clients, doctors and patients, gurus and disciples, etc
 are similar in that the first party inspires the other's wishes because of their specific relationship
 avaanchit prabhaav siddh karne ke liye yah bhi siddh karnaa aavashyak he ki vastut: vishisht sthitiwale paksh ke duusare paksh par apni vishesh sthiti kaa prayog apane anuchit laabh ke liye kiya
 If this is not proved, a contract will not be deemed to be affected or abandoned by undue influence only because of the specific situation
 yah sanvida adhinium kii dhara 17 main varnit he
 According to him, the following actions shall be called fraud in order to induce the other party or his agent to cheat or trick or join the contract by any party of the contract or by his agent or by his agent: k) kisi asaty baat ko, jisaki satyata main use vishwaas na ho, tathy batalaana, B) to hide a fact which he does not know or believe; ga) aisa vachan dena jise puraa karne kii ichha na ho; D) to do or be dissuaded from an act which the law specifically declares as treachery; ng) dhokhaa dene laayak anya kaary karnaa
 In relation to the agreement, it has been said that there is a need to have a mental consensus between the parties
 bhranti isi se sambandhit dosha he
 In this, one side understands an object or thing and the other side understands the other thing or thing
 falswaroop upree dhang se dekhne main to sanvida kaa nirmaan prathit hota he parantu bhranti ke kaaran vastut: koi sanvida hoti nahin he
 There are many types of these misconceptions
 vishaysaamagree ke sambandh main bhranti kaa udhaaharan purvaprasang main shevarlyt or ford motor kaaron ke dwaara diya gaya he
 Similarly, there is confusion in the identity of the parties to the contract
 "k" ne jise "kha" samajhakar sanvida kii yadi vah vastut: "kha" nahin varan "ga" tha to yah paksh kii pahchaan kii bhranti he
 The nature or meaning of the contract can also be confused
 agar kisi baad kaa ek paksh baad main avasar lene kaa aavedan patr bataakar kisi sandhipatr par duusare paksh kaa hastakshar kara letaa he to duusare paksh ko sanvida ke rup yaa prakruti ke vishay main bhranti hoti he
 In such a case, the signature maker's mind is not with his signature
 prasanvida ke liye pratifal ek aavashyak tatv he
 There can be no covenant without consideration; And even if it is, it is disarmed or illegal
 pratifal bhi vaid hona chahie
 For example "A", "B" are charged Rs 5000 for killing "S"
 And "B" pledge to kill
 yahan yah sanvida ni:satv he kyonki iskaa pratifal hatya kanoon dwaara varjit he
 Thus the following types of returns are invalid - 1
 aise pratifal jo kanoon varjit hai
 If any consideration is explicitly or symbolically forbidden by law, then the covenant made on the basis of it is void
 yah uparyukt udhaaharan se spasht ho jayega
 2
 If there is any consideration which disrupts or nullifies any arrangement of an act, then that consideration shall be deemed to be invalid
 3
 jo pratifal kapatpurna hote hai, ve avaidh samajhe jate hai
 4
 The reward by which a person's body or property is damaged is illegal
 udhaaharan ke liye a ek samachaarpatr ke sampadak ko paanch sau rupaya dene kaa vachan detaa he yadi sampadak ba ke sambandh main apmanjanak vivaran chaape
 The reward here is illegal because it hurts B's reputation
 5
 aise pratifal jo aniatik hote hai, avaidh hai
 6
 Returns against public policy are illegal, such as trading with the enemy
 lokseva ko haani pahunchaane kii pravriti rakhanevaali sanvida, dandaneey aparaadhon se sambandhit mukademon kaa galaa ghotanevaali sanvida ni:satv hoti he
 Contracts tending to misuse statutory action, such a contract is against morality, or a trade contract or someone who is against morality, or a trade contract or a contract to prevent an individual from marrying, etc
 also against public policy And are non-existent
 uddeshy evam pratifal main se ek kaa bhi avaidh hona sanvida ko ni:satv kar detaa he
 If the purpose of the contract is partially invalid, the contract becomes void even if its illegal share can be separated from the valid part
 yadi pratifal yaa uddeshy kaa avaidh ansh vaid ansh se alag kiya ja sake to vaid ansh pravartaneey hoga or avaidh ansh ni:satv hoga
 Eg "B" pledged to give "A" 2000 rupees by a covenant, out of which Rs 1500 was an old loan and Rs 500 was a loss in gambling
 isamen vaid bhaag kaa avaidh bhaag se pruthak kiya ja saktaa he; atev yah pratigyaptr 1500 rupye ke liye maanya hoga kintu 500) ke liye ni:satv hoga
