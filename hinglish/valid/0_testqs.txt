 The first and last commentators unequivocally consider Ruyak or Ruchak, the author of the Alankarasarvasva; There is no reference to Mankhak as an ornamental, except for a passage in the well-known tradition of rhetoric from Shobhakar to Panditraj Jagannath
 pracheen pandulipiyon kii pushpikas ruyyak ko sarvasv kaa lekhak ghoshit karti hai
 The internal evidence also proves the same, however, the Samudrabandha has considered the ornamentation of everything as a work of Mankhak
 sambhav he, sandhivigrahik mankhak ne apane guru ke granth kaa sampadan sanshodhan kiya ho jisase sudur dakshin main uske krititv kii bhrant parampara chal padi ho
 Ruyak's theory for the department in the word, meaning and ambiguity of ornaments is of dependence
 jo alankaar jis par ashrith hota he vah uskaa alankaar hota he
 The existence or absence of a word is not a regulator of the Decking Department

 is vargeekaran ko sarvaadhik vyavasthit tathaa vaigyanik mana jaataa he
 Before this, virtually no rhetoric had adopted the system of systematic classification with respect to any base
 pratiti kaa paurvapary tathaa alankaar lakshanon kaa paraspar sadharmy vaidharmy ek varg main aanevaale alankaaron ke kram ke niamak tatv he
 Sangopang epistemology of ornaments, not only its relation to phonation theory, but also Mahimbhatt's anti-sound theory, the interpretation of permissivism and the re-establishment of phonology is also the principal work of the ryukas
 vyaktivivek vyaakhyaan yaa 'vichaar' main mahimbhatt ke mat kaa vivechan karte hue yah siddh kiya he ki anumaanprakriya main dhvanimarg ko yaa anumiti main vyangyarth saundarya ko nahin bandha ja saktaa
 In the preface of Alankarasarvasva, Ruyak has made it clear that in the rhetoric of Bhamah, Uddhata, Rudrat etc
 and the seeds of sound in the ritualism of Vamana, it is clear that in the curiosities of Bhattnayaka's spirit and Bhoga the sound of Kuntaka and sound in Mahimabhatta's 'conjecture' The implication of is not possible

 jalsambar yaa droni us bhugolic kshetra ko kehete hai jahaan varsha athwa pighalati barf kaa pani nadiyon, nehron or naalon se bah kar ek hi sthaan par ekatrit ho jaataa he
 From that place, water either flows into the same big river by draining it from the watershed area, or it is found in a lake, ocean, ocean or marshy area
 is sandarbh main kabhi-kabhi jalavibhaajak shabd kaa bhi prayog hota he kyonki bhinn-bhinn jalsambar kisi bhi vistrut kshetra ko alag-alag jal mandalon main vibhajit karte hai
 The watershed may be open or closed
 band jalsambharon main pani kisi sarovar yaa sookhe sarovar main ja kar ruk jaataa he
 The closed watersheds which are in dry places often come in water to evaporate from the heat to steam or the earth absorbs it
 padosi jalsambar aksar pahaado, parvaton yaa dharti kii bhinn dhalaanon ke kaaran ek-dusre se vibhajit hote hai
 Geographically, watersheds act as a funnel because they collect water over a wide area and carry it to a water-absorbing location within the same river, reservoir, swamp, or earth
 angrezi main "jalsambar" ko "watershad" yaa "cachament", "jalavibhaajak" ko "drenez divide" or "droni" ko "basin" kaha jaataa he

 lekin saath hi pitru shatru bhi
shani grah ke sambandh me anek bhrantiyaan or is liye use maarak, ashubh or dukh kaarak mana jaataa he
 Western astrologers also consider him to be a painter
 lekin shani utana ashubh or maarak nahi he, jitna use mana jaataa he
 Therefore he is not an enemy, friend
 moksh ko dene vaala ek maatr shani grah hi he
 The truth is that Saturn creates balance in nature, and does fair justice to every living being
 jo log anuchit vishmata or aswabhaavik samta ko aashray dete hai, shani keval unhi ko dandint karte hai

 dharmagrantho ke anusaar surya kii patni sangya kii chaaya ke garbh se shani dev kaa janm hua, jab shani dev chaaya ke garbh main the tab chaaya bhagwaan shankar kii bhakthi main itani dhyaan magn thi kii usne apane khaane pine tak shudh nahin thi jiskaa prabhaav uske putr par padaa or uskaa varna shyaam ho gaya !shani ke shyamvarn ko dekhakar surya ne apni patni chaaya par aarope lagaaya kii shani meraa putr nahin hai ! tabhi se shani apane pita se shatru bhav rakhte the ! shani dev ne apni sadhana tapasya dwaara shivaji ko prasann kar apane pita surya kii bhanti shakti praapt kii or shivaji ne shani dev ko vardaan maangane ko kaha, tab shani dev ne prarthana kii ki yugon yugon main meri mata chaaya kii paraajay hoti rahi hai, mere pita pita surya dwaara anek baar apamaanit kiya gaya hai ! atah mata kii ikcha hai ki meraa putr apane pita se mere apmaan kaa badla le or unase bhi zyada shaktishaalee bane ! tab bhagwaan shankar ne vardaan dete hue kaha ki navagrahon main tumhaara sarvshereshth sthaan hoga ! maanav to kya devtaa bhi tumhare naam se bhaybheet rahenge ! adhik jaankaree ke liye dekhe link shani We get many stories in the Puranas regarding Shani
 mata ke chal ke kaaran pita ne use shaap diya
pita arthath surya ne kaha,"aap krurtapurna drishti dekhne vaale mandagami grah ho jaye"
yah bhi aakhyaan miltaa he ki shani ke prakope se hi apane rajya ko ghor durbhiksh se bachaane ke liye raja dasharath unase muqabla karne pahunche to unka purusharth dekh kar shani ne unase vardaan maangane ke liye kaha
raja dasharath ne vidhivat stuti kar use prasann kiya
 The Padma Purana has a detailed description of this episode
 brahmavaivart puraana main shani ne jagat janani parvati ko bataaya he ki main sau janmo tak jataka kii kerani kaa fal bhugtan karata hoon
ek baar jab vishnupriya lakshmi ne shani se puunchhaa ki tum kyon jaatakon ko dhan haani karte ho, kyon sabhi tumhaare prabhaav se pratadit rahete hai, to shani maharaj ne uttar diya,"mateshwari, usame meraa koi dosha nahi he, parampita paramatma ne mujhe tino lokon kaa nyaayadhish niyukt kiya hua he, isaliye jo bhi tino lokon ke andar anyaay karata he, use dand dena meraa kaam he"
ek aakhyaan or miltaa he, ki kis prakaar se rishi agast ne jab shani dev se prarthana kii thi, to unhone rakshason se unako mukti dilwaai thi
 Whoever did injustice, he punished them, even if it was Lord Shiva's Ardhangini Sati, who, after taking the form of Sita, lied to Baba Bhole Nath, and in consequence he was sacrificed in the sacrifice of his own father
 Shani Dev forced to die by burning in the pool, or Raja Harishchandra, whose pride of donating had to be sold in the seventh market and even to keep the crematorium Take the Padi, or King Nal and Damayanti, for the punishment of their frivolous sins, they have to wander from rate to rate, and the fished fish swim away in the water, then whatever manna, covenant, by ordinary man Karmana is sinned, whether it is done in the know or unknown, it will have to suffer
 matsay puraana main mahatma shani dev kaa sharir indra kanti kii neelmani jaisi he, ve giddh par savaar he, haath me dhanush baan he ek haath se var mudra bhi he,shani dev kaa vikaraal rup bhayaavah bhi he
 Shani is always a destroyer for sinners
 pashchim ke sahitya me bhi anek aakhyaan milte hai,shani dev ke anek mandir hai,bharat main bhi shani dev ke anek mandir hai, jaise shinganapur, vrundavan ke kokila van,gwalior ke shanishcharaaji,dilli tathaa anek shaharon me maharaj shani ke mandir hai

 At the time of birth in the 12th house of the horoscope, Saturn tells the story of what will be the ups and downs in the life of the native, according to his speed and the emotions given to the native
 shani mand he or shani hi thandak dene vaala he,surya naam ujaalaa to shani naam andheraa, pehle bhav me apana sthaan banane kaa kaaran he ki shani apane gochar kii gati or apni dasha me shok paidaa karegaa,jeev ke andar shok kaa dukh milte hi vah aage peeche sab kuch bhul kar keval andhere me hi khoyaa rahata he
 Saturn becomes the object of witchcraft, when Saturn gives its momentum in the first house, the first house is the only one, when the darkness starts hiding, the light is recognized and when the position is hidden then the shadow of Saturn Only darkness can be considered
 andhere ke kai rup hote hai, ek andheraa vah hota he jiske kaaran kuch bhi dikhaai nahi detaa he, yah ankhon kaa andheraa mana jaataa he, ek andheraa samajhane kaa bhi hota he, saamne kuch hota he, or samajha kuch jaataa he, ek andheraa buraaiyon kaa hota he, vyakti yaa jeev kii sabhi achchhaaiyaan buraaiyon ke andar chupane kaa kaaran bhi shani kaa diya gaya andheraa hi mana jaataa he, naam kaa andheraa bhe hota he, kisi ko pataa hi nahi hota he, ki koun he or kahaan se aayaa he, koun maan he or koun baap he, aadi ke dwaara kisi bhi rup me chhupav bhi shani ke kaaran hi mana jaataa he, vyakti chaalaaki kaa putala ban jaataa he pratham bhav ke shani ke dwaara
shani apane sthaan se pratham bhav ke andar sthiti rakh kar tisare bhav ko dekhtaa he, teesraa bhav apane se chote bhai bahino kaa bhi hota he, apni andaruni takat kaa bhi hota he, parakram kaa bhi hota he, jo kuch bhi ham dusron se kehete he, kisi bhi saadhan se, kisi bhi tarah se shani ke kaaran apni baat ko sampreshit karne me kathinaayee aati he, jo kaha jaataa he vah saamne vaale ko yaa to samaj me nahi aata he, or aata bhi he to ek bhayanak andheraa hone ke kaaran vah kahi gayi baat ko na samajhane ke kaaran kuch kaa kuch samaj letaa he, parinaam ke andar fal bhi jo chaiye vah nahi miltaa he, aksar dekha jaataa he ki jiske pratham bhav me shani hota he, uskaa jivan saathi jor jor se bolnaa chaalu kar detaa he, uskaa kaaran uske dwaara jor jor se bolne kii aadat nahi, pratham bhav kaa shani sunne ke andar kami kar detaa he, or saamne vaale ko jor se bolne par hi yaa to sunaayi detaa he, yaa vah kuch kaa kuch samaj letaa he, isi liye jivan saathi ke saath kuch sunne or kuch samajhane ke kaaran maansik naa samajhi kaa parinaam sambandhon me kaduvaahat ghul jaati he, or sambandh tut jate hai
 From its first house, the tenth eye directly looks at the spirit of karma, this is also the spirit of karma
 jataka ko karm karne or karm ko samajhane me kaafii kathinaayee kaa saamana karnaa pasta he, jab kisi prakaar se karm ko nahi samajha jaataa he to jo bhi kiya jaataa he vah karm na hokar ek bhaar swaroop hi samajha jaataa he, yahi baat pita ke prati maan lee jaati he,pita ke prati shani apni sift ke anusaar andhera detaa he, or us andhere ke kaaran pita ne putr ke prati kya kiya he, samaj nahi hone ke kaaran pita putr main anban bhi bani rahati he,putr kaa lagan yaa pratham bhav kaa shani mata ke chauthe bhav me chalaa jaataa he, or mata ko jo kaam nahi karne chaiye ve usko karne passage hai, kathin or ek seemaa me rahakar mata ke dwaara kaam karne ke kaaran uskaa jivan ek ghere main bandhaa sa rah jaataa he, or vah apni shariri sift ko us prakaar se prayog nahi kar paati he jis prakaar se ek saadhaaran aadmi apni jindagi ko jeena chahta he
 The second house is the sense of material wealth, by physical wealth means, rupee, money, gold, silver, diamond, pearl, jewelry, etc
 When Shani Dev is in the second house, he also keeps his dark towards his family members, Only by getting family members to fight, quarrel etc
, they distance themselves from their own family, in the matter of money, it is not known how much came and how much was spent, how much did it come from, the second feeling is the sense of speaking, whatever It is talked about, He does not know what has been said, can also be abusive and cold talk also, cold talk means negative thing, be asked to do any thing, nor should it come out in the north
 Also, the fourth house is also related to the mother, house, and vehicle, the fourth house is also known for its pleasures, in the second Saturn, nothing is seen except the traveling work and sleeping in the house
 doosraa shani sidhe rup me aathven bhav ko dekhtaa he, aathva bhav shamshani takaton kii taraf rujhaan badhaa detaa he, vyakti bhoot,pret,jinn or pishachi shaktiyon ko apnaane main apana man laga detaa he, shamshani sadhana ke kaaran uskaa khan paan bhi shamshani ho jaataa he,sharaab,kebab or bhoot ke bhojan main uski ruchi batch jaati he
 Second Saturn also sees the eleventh house, the eleventh house darkens its faith towards immovable property, darkens the mind towards friends and elder brothers and sisters
 ve kuch karnaa chaahate hai lekin vyakti ke dimag main kuch or hi samaj me aata he
 The third sense is of might, of the courage and courage of the person, wherever the person lives, of his neighbors
 in sabake kaarnon ke andar tisare bhav se shani pancham bhav ko bhi dekhtaa he, jiname shiksha,santan or turat aane vaale dhano ko bhi janaa jaataa he, mitron kii sahabhaagita or bhabhi kaa bhav bhi paanchavaa bhav mana jaataa he, pita kii mrityu kaa or dada ke bade bhai kaa bhav bhi paanchavaa he
 Apart from this, the third Shani also hurts the ninth house, in which knowledge of religion, social behavior, old customs and family practice etc
 is also hurt
 makaan or aaraam karne vaale sthano ke prati yah shani apni andhere vaali niti ko pratipaadit karata he
 This Saturn tortures Nanihal family
 chauthe bhav kaa mukhya prabhaav vyakti ke liye kaafii ksht dene vaala hota he, mata, man, makaan, or pani vaale saadhan, tathaa sharir kaa pani is shani ke prabhaav se gandala jaataa he, aaajeevan kshtdhene vaala hone se puraano me is shani vaale vyakti kaa jivan nark may hi bataaya jaataa he
 If this Saturn is of Libra, Capricorn, Aquarius or Pisces, then there is some reduction in sufferings in its fruit
 is bhav me shani ke hone ke kaaran vyakti ko mantra vetta bana detaa he, vah kitne hi good mantron ke dwaara logo kaa bhala karne vaala to ban jaataa he, lekin apane liye jivan saathi ke prati,jaaydaad ke prati, or nagad dhan ke saath jamaa puunji ke liye dukh hi uthaaya karata he
 Due to the presence of Saturn in the child and being cold, there is a delay in the child, there is a lot of female child, due to the loss of life with a partner, he remains more indifferent to his life
 is bhav me shani kitne hi daihik daivik or bhautik rogon kaa daata ban jaataa he, lekin is bhav kaa shani paariwarik shatruta ko samaapt kar detaa he,mamaa khandaan ko samaapt karne vaala hota he,chachaa khandan se kabhi banati nahi he
 If a person keeps on doing the work done in some way, then he is successful, if somehow he does the work of the owner, then he fails
 apni teesri najar se aathven bhav ko dekhne ke kaaran se vyakti dur drishti se kisi bhi kaam yaa samasya ko nahi samaj paata he, kaaryon se kisi na kisi prakaar se apane prati jokhim ko nahi samaj paane se jo bhi kamata he, yaa jo bhi kiya jaataa he, uske prati andheraa hi rahata he, or aksmaat samasya aane se pareshaan hokar jo bhi paas me hota he ganvaa detaa he
 Due to the darkness in the twelfth house, there is also ignorance of the external calamities, for whatever reason they become external, they are either duped by them or they find themselves hurt due to Saturn's tricks of outsiders
 khud ke chote bhai bahin kya kar rahe hai or unki kaary pranali khud ke prati kya he uske prati anjaan rahata he
 Often, when this sign of Saturn comes, it gives way to disorientation, and often such people forget even in the known place
 saatvaan bhav patni or mantranaa karne vaale logo se apana sambandh rakhata he
 Due to the darkness of life partner and the persistence of negative thoughts in the mind, the person always considers himself to be a childless in everything, the life partner starts to get away from the native with a little bit of time only after being denied as a negation, If the native could not make positive thoughts towards himself, then in most cases the householders have been seen to be ruined, and the result of two marriages is due to the seventh Saturn
 He has been seen to be found, seventh Saturn remains indifferent to the old customs and towards his ancestors, only because of thinking about himself and i cannot do anything, due to the continuation of his old dignity
 It is often forgotten, because of the status of work and non-functioning in father and son, there is a rift
 vyakti apane rahane vaale sthaan par apane kaaran banaakar ashaanti utpann karata rahata he, apni mata yaa mata jaisi mahila ke man me virodh bhi paidaa karata rahata he, use lagata he ki jo bhe uske prati kiya ja rahaa he, vah galat hi kiya ja rahaa he or isi kaaran se vah apane hi logon se virodh paidaa karne me nahi hichakataa he
 Due to the effect of this Saturn on the body's water, the mind's thoughts get dirty, the person gets the diseases of the stomach and the reproductive organs in his body, and the diseases of the female child, etc
 due to this Saturn
 is bhav kaa shani khaane pine or mouj masti karne ke chakkar main jeb hameshaa khaali rakhata he
 Because of not knowing which work to do, the rise of vagabond in the person has been seen, Saturn of the higher gives ability to supernatural knowledge, even secret knowledge is also a factor of Saturn
 navaan bhav bhagya kaa mana gaya he, is bhav main shani hone ke kaaran se kathin or dukh daayi yatraayen karne ko milti hai, lagaataar gum kar cells aadi ke kaamo me kaafii pareshaani kerani padati he, agar yah bhav sahi hota he, to vyakti mazaakia hota he, or har baat ko chutkulon ke dwaara kaha karata he, magar jab is bhav me shani hota he to vyakti syrius ho jaataa he, or ekaant main apane ko rakhane apni bhalaai sochataa he, nawein bhav baale shani ke ke kaaran vyakti apni pahichaan ekaant vaasa jhagadaa na jhansa vaali kahawat se purna rakhata he
 Cultivating works, house-building works, works for property related work
 agar koi acha grah is shani par apni najar rakhata he to vyakti jaj vaale kaamo kii taraf or court kachhari vaale kaamon kii taraf apana rujhaan rakhata he
 Doctors of animals and also teach animals, most of the ninth Saturn people love to raise animals
 kitabon ko chhapakar bechney vaale bhi nawein shani se kahi na kahi jude hote hai
 Tenth Saturn takes the mind towards hard work, whatever are the hard work, wood, stone, iron etc
 They all come in the area of saturn tenth, the person creates a field towards work in his life and that area Does not want to leave rahu kaa asar hone se yaa kisi bhi prakaar se mangal kaa prabhaav ban jane se is prakaar kaa vyakti yatayaat kaa sipaahi ban jaataa he, use jindagi ke kitne hi kaam or kitne hi logon ko baari baari se paas karnaa pasta he, dasven shani vaale kii najar bahut hi tej hoti he vah kisi bhi rakhi cheez ko nahi bhuulataa he, mehnat kii kamakar khaanaa jaanata he, apane rahane ke liye jab bhi makaan aadi banaata he to keval strecchar hi banaakar khada kar paata he, uske rahane ke liye kabhi bhi badhia aaleeshaan makaan nahi ban paata he

 jataka apane apane shraddhanusaar koi dandavat parikrama karata he, yaa koi paidal parikrama karata he, jo log shani dev kaa raja dasharath krit stotra kaa paath karte hue, yaa shani ke beej mantra kaa jaap karte huye parikrama karte hai, unako achche falon kii sheeghra prapti ho jaati he
 According to astrology, there are three kinds of beliefs of Saturn's Saadhesati, firstly, secondly by Chandra Lagan or Zodiac and third by Sun Lagna, in North India, the calculation of Saturn's half-sati by Chandra Lagana has been in practice since ancient times
 
 is manyata ke anusaar jab shanidev chandra raashi par gochar se apana bhraman karte hai to sadhesati maani jaati he, iskaa prabhaav raashi main aane ke tees maah pehle se or tees maah baad tak anubhav hota he
 During Sadesati, Saturn takes account of the deeds done by the native in the same way as the owner asks for the account after some time after giving full responsibility to the servant of a house, and in the case of mistake or mistake Punishment is given to the servant, similarly Shani Dev also punishes every creature
 or yahi nahi jin logon ne achche karm kiye hote hai to unako sadheshaati puraskaar bhi pradaan karti he, jaise nagar yaa gram kaa yaa shahar kaa mukhiya bana diya janaa aadi
shani kii sadhesati ke aakhyaan anek logon ke praapt hote hai, jaise raja vikramaditya, raja nal, raja harishchandr, shani kii sadhesati sant mahatmaon ko bhi pratadit karti he, jo jog ke saath bhoga ko apnaane lagate hai
 Every person must have a Sadesati once in thirty years, if this half-and-half is in Sagittarius, Pisces, Capricorn, Aquarius, it is less painful, if it will be in the fourth, sixth, eighth, and twelfth house, So the person will be unhappy, and all the happiness will be physical, mental, and economic
 They should never forget the "sapphire" in these Sadesati, if done, there is a possibility of loss of profit
 koi nayaa kaam, nayaa udyog, bhul kar bhi sadhesati main nahi karnaa chaiye, kisi bhi kaam ko karne se pehle kisi jaankaar jyotishi se jaankaree avashya kar leni chaiye
yahaan tak ki vaahan ko bhi bhuulakar is samay main nahi khareednaa chaiye, anyathaa vah vaahan sukh kaa vaahan na hokar dukhon kaa vaahan ho jaayegaa
hamane apane pichley pachchis saal ke anubhav me dekha he ki sadhesati main kitne hi udyogpatiyon kaa bura haal ho gaya, or jo crorespati the, ve rodpati hokar ek gamche main ghoomane lage
is prakaar se yah bhi naubhav kiya ki shani jab bhi chaar, chha:, aath, baarah me vicharan karegaa, to uskaa mul dhan to nasht hoga hi, kitna hi jatan kyon na kiya jaye
or shani ke is samay kaa vichaar pehle se kar liya gaya he to dhan kii raksha ho jaati he
 If caution is not taken then only remorse remains
 at: prayek manushya ko is samay kaa shani armbh hone ke pehle hi jap tap or jo vidhaan ham aage baataayenge unako kar lenaa chaiye
shani dev ke prakope se bachane ke liye ravan ne unhen apni kaid main pairon se baandh kar sar neeche kii taraf kiye hue rakhaa tha taaki shani kii vakr drushti ravan pe na pade

shani dev ne pita kii aagyaanusaar vaisaa hi kiya, or tap karne ke baad bhagwaan shankar ke vartmaan main bhi sthit shivlinga kii sthapana kii, jo aaj bhi kaashi-vishwanath ke naam se janaa jaataa he, or karm ke kaarak shani ne apane manovanchit falon kii prapti bhagwaan shankar se kii, or grahon main sarvopari pad praapt kiya
