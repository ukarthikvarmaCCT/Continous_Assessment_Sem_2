 dengue, chikangunia se rajdhani ke logon kii jang jari he
 In such a situation, the role of agencies is considered to be very important and that is why MCD has made different helpline numbers for each of its zones
 taaki koi kahin bhi kooday kaa dher dekhe to turant in helpline numbers par kol karke madad le saktaa he
 The problem of dengue panic in the people is that these calls to these helpline numbers every 1 minute every 7th minute, which request to remove the surrounding garbage

 Similarly, there is a constant pressure on the agencies

 It is a matter of fact that even in such a severe condition of Delhi, there is a lot of rot in the streets and lanes where there is a lot of garbage and it is causing diseases among people

 The residents of Jagatpuri believe that there is no action from these helpline numbers and garbage remains on the streets and outside the house
 kooday kii vajah se puri colony main dengue, chikangunia failaa hua he
 There is a patient present in every house
 sawaal ye he ki ek taraf to MCD helpline numbers ke jariye itani shikaayatein darj hone kaa daawa kar rahi he or vahiin duusari taraf jamini taur par kuch najar nahi aa rahaa he

 The ministry said that the envoy has been clearly told that India reserves the right to take firm and decisive action to safeguard its national security
 videsh mantralay ne kaha ki bharat ne pakistan ko yah bhi spasht kar diya he ki bhartiya rakshakarmi ko koi nuksaan nahin pahunchaaya janaa chahie
 Pakistan captured a wing commander after a fierce clash between the air forces of the two countries near the Line of Control (loc)
 is jhadap main pakistan ke ek ladaaku vimaan ko maar giraaya gaya or bhartiya vayusena ko bhi apana ek mig 21 ganvaana padaa
 Shortly thereafter, the Pakistan Army released a video, in which the military personnel shown have identified themselves as Indian Air Force pilots

" pakistan main aatanki sanghathan jaish e mohammad ke prashikshan shiviron ke bhartiya vayusena dwaara nestnabud karne ke ek din baad paak vayusena ne yah harakat kii
 "it is unfortunate that Pakistan, instead of fulfilling its international obligations and bilateral commitment to take credible action against terrorist organizations and people operating from its land, Pakistan took an aggressive step against India," the ministry said
 ''mantralay ne kaha, ‘‘yah spasht rup se sandesh de diya gaya he ki bharat apni rashtriya suraksha, samprabhutaa or kshetreey akhandta kii raksha ke liye thos or nirnaayak karrwai karne kaa adhikaar rakhata he
 The Foreign Ministry said that it has been regretted that the political and military leadership of Pakistan has been consistently denying the presence of a terrorist structure in the area under its control
 mantralay ne kaha, ‘‘pakistani paksh ko pulavama hamale main jaish e mohammad kii sanliptata or pakistan main jaish e mohammad ke aatanki shiviron tathaa iske netritv kii maujuudagi ke sambandh main dastavej diya gaya
 "the message has been given that India expects that Pakistan will take immediate and authentic action to eliminate terrorism from the areas under its control," the ministry said

 Dhanteras 2018: Know why Dhanteras is celebrated? Like every festival, there is a mythological story behind celebrating Dhanteras
 hindu dharmagranthon ke mutabik, jab kshirsagar kaa manthan ho rahaa tha to dhanvantari amrit kaa gadaa lekar prakat hue the
 That is why Dhanteras is celebrated as a festival of happiness and prosperity
 shastron ke anusaar, samudr manthan ke dauraan trayodashi ke din bhagwaan dhanvantari prakat hue the, isliye is din ko dhan trayodashi kaha jaataa he
 Dhanteras: Not only gold and silver, buying these things will also take place throughout the year, do not buy money on the day of Varshan Dhanteras, it is considered auspicious to buy gold, silver or new utensils on the day of Dhanteras
 lekin is din lohe ke bartan va isse baniin chijen kharidne se bachanaa chahie
 Most people buy steel utensils on Dhanteras, but steel is also a form of iron, so it is advisable not to buy steel utensils on Dhanteras
 steel va lohe ke alaava kaanch ke bartan bhi kharidne se bachanaa chahie
 Dhanteras 2018: Do not forget to buy these 10 things, Lakshmi will become auspicious to buy these things as a symbol of prosperity on the day of angry Dhanateras - lakshmi-ganesh idols made of gold, silver, metal, new utensils

 It is believed that this nectar urn is made of brass because brass is the favorite metal of Lord Dhanvantari
 isiilie dhanteras ke din pital kii kharidari ko zyada faldaayi mana gaya he
 Surely buy these 5 things on Dhanteras, do not bring Kuber's Kripakhali utensils - Buying utensils on the day of Dhanteras is considered very auspicious, but it is important to keep some precautions in mind when shopping for utensils
 ghar par khaali bartan kabhi naa laaen
 On bringing it home, fill it with water

 The Supreme Court rules are being blown openly these days at the Buland Darwaza and Hazrat Sheikh Salim Chishti's Dargah of Vishwadeya Smarak Fatehpur Sikri in Agra district
 ajtak
 The team of In has revealed the matter in a sting operation
 jahaan khuleam vyavsaayik gatividhiyon kaa sanchaalan kiya ja rahaa he
 While such activities are banned by the Supreme Court within a 100 meters radius of any Vishwdaya memorial
 fatehpur sikri ke world heritage monument buland darwaja or prakhyat sufi sant hazrat shaikh saleem chishti kii dargah ko dekhne ke liye duniyabar se paryatak aate hai
 But there are incidents of bullying and gabbing with the tourists here too
 jisaki sabase badi vajah he, dargah parisar main avaidh rup se lagane vaali dukaane
 No action on the complaint
 The Supreme Court has clear instructions in this regard, whether any business activities can be done up to a hundred meters around any World Memorial
 lekin fatehpur sikri smarak parisar main khuleam jameen par dukaane lagaai ja rahi hai
 When ASI officials complain about this to the Agra Police Administration from time to time, but no action is taken
 nijee surakshakarmiyon ke hawaale he surakshatajamahal kii kii suraksha kaa jimmaa siaisef ke paas he, lekin fatehpur sikri main aisa nahin he
 Rather, the security of ASI itself is guarded by private security guards here
 eesai ne ek sicurity company ko is kaam kaa jimmaa saunp rakhaa he
 There are 46 guards stationed in the security of the memorial 24 hours
 agar ve avaidh rup se lagane vaali dukaanon kaa virodh karte hai, to sthaneey logon se unki jhadap ho jaati he
 Just a few days ago a security guard was beaten up by some locals at the Fatehpur Sikri memorial
 yahaan tak ki uski vardi bhi faad di thi
 Police administration is sitting closed eyes Although the officials of ASI do not say anything against the police administration of Agra, but somewhere the apathy of the police department is causing trouble for them
 yahi vajah he ki sthaneey dukandaar supreme court ke niyamon ko darkinar kar parisar main jabaran dukaane lagaae baithen hai
 About this, when we saw the SSP of Agra, Dr
 pritinder singh se baat karne kii koshish kii to ve phone par nahin aae
 However, when asked by his PRO in this regard, he told that he will get the matter talked to
 magar na to unhone phone kiya or na hi siuji number dobaaraa uthaane kii jahamat uthaai
 Even SMS was done to talk on both the SSP numbers
 magar koi uttar nahin mila
 Apparently, police officers are hesitant to speak on this matter
 camere main kaid hui avaidh dukanendesh ke sabase badi adaalat smarakon par hone vaali is tarah kii avaidh gatividhiyon ko lekar khaasi gambhir he
 Despite this, the police administration is negligent
 jab hamaari team ne maukey par jaakar muyna kiya to paaya ki smarak ke pravesh dwaar par bani sidhiyon se lekar parisar ke andar chaaron taraf jameen par dukaane saji hui hai
 Even the main gate of the monument, ie the Buland Darwaza, is not spared from these shops
 hamaare camere kii najar main sari dukaane or dukandaar kaid ho gaye
 Those who have no fear of ASI nor care about the Supreme Court rules
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki smarak kii dekharekh or sangrakshan ke liye jimmedaar vibhaag eesai kii lakh shikayaton ke baavjood is maamle main koi karrwai na hona sidhe taur par police kii bhoomika par sawaal khadey karata he

 Tell us that the Mughal emperor Akbar kept this city as the capital from 1571 to 1585

 The entrance to the mosque is a 54 meter high Buland Darwaza, which was constructed in 1570 AD
 masjid ke uttar main mashhoor sufi sant hazrat shaikh saleem chishti kii dargah he
 Apart from this, Aankh Michauli, diwan-i-khas, Buland Darwaza, Panch Mahal, Khwabgah, Anup Talab are the main monuments of Fatehpur Sikri

 Let me tell you that Imran Khan has always been talking about resolving the dispute with India, but even after assuming power, there are no concrete signs of friendship from his side
 vah border par shanti kii baat bhi karte hai, lekin aatankwaad par lagaam lagane ke liye kabhi kuch nahin bolte hai
 Even recently, when the US Secretary of State congratulated Imran Khan and called upon him to rein in the terrorist organizations operating in Pakistan, this thing also shocked him
 pakistan ne america se apana bayaan tak sahi karne ko kah daalaa
 In such a situation, there is also a question on the seriousness of the Imran government's attempt to resolve the Kashmir issue without a strong stand against terror

 Film Review: Bablu Happi Hector: Saahil Anand, Irika Fernandes, Amol Parashar, Sumit Suri, Preet Kamal, Reyna Malhotra Director: Neil Madhab pandaderation: 1 hour 55 minutesrating: If one of the five stars, the film 'zindagi Na Milegi Dobara' gets AIDS
 ek or film ban jaaegi, jiskaa naam hoga ‘bablu hapi he
 Do not get confused, understand in short
 teen dost hai, masti maar rahe hai
 One is about to get married, his fiancée Kanken types and the other two don't like friends very much
 teenon dost daaru pite hai, dance karte hai or shaadi se pehle ek bachalers adventure trip par janaa chaahate hai
 He goes and fiance breaks there too
 magar saath main aata he aids kaa dar
 This is where the film leaves the track of Brother Romance (bromance) and Relationship, and gets you sensitized towards HIV positive people
 or aakhir main sabko milte hai kuch sandesh
 Like, touching, kissing, eating together does not help AIDS
 aids ke marijon ko hamaare pyaar or hausale kii jarurat hoti he or cajual sex nahin karnaa chahie
 Do not give up, listen to the story, Jajin, Harry and Rohan are Jigar Man
 jatin regular banda he, harry desi punjabi he or rohan ge he
 Jatin is getting married to Tamanna
 uske pehle yaar bachaler party karte hai, jahaan jatin ‘bahak’ jaataa he
 Well the next day Manna takes care of Tamanna's threat
 phir ye teenon nikalate hai, bachaler trip ke himalay kii vaadiyon main
 But there is a break in the way because Tamanna is married to Kajin in Manali
 us dauraan teenon yaar us ladki natasha se phir-phir milte hai, jiske saath jatin bahaka tha
 Chemistry develops between the two and only then many social, psychological truths begin to be revealed
 in saare satyon kaa base camp banataa he, barf se ghira vah guest house jahaan ek kapal aids awarenes ke liye enjio chalaata he
 Finally, in Jatin's life, Twist comes and then he comes to understand that caution is the rescue
 ye kya kiya tumne nilafilm bablu hapi he ko banaaya he nil madhav pandas ne
 Prior to this, he has given intensive and message-filled films like 'I Am Kalam' and 'jalpari'
 magar un filmon main chust patakatha, liptor jaise kai yaadgaar kirdaar or damdaar acting the
 While Bablu is Happy, Confused and imitated
 film main acchhee acting kii baat karen to pitampura ke harry ke role main sumit suri bahut prabhavit karte hai
 Amol Parashar is also fine in Rohan's role
 baaki sabko dekhakar lagata he, jaise acting kar ye screen par ehsaan kar rahe hon
 Sahil Anand, who got the most footage as Jatin, missed the opportunity
 yahi baat tamanna kaa role nibhaane vaali preet camel or natasha ko parade par utaarne vaali irika par bhi lagu hoti he
 Pravin Dabas also has a cameo in the film
 na jane main zyada bachaav he‘bablu hapi he’ jabaran kool hone kii koshish karti he or is pher main bahut shor machaati he
 Then when this track changes, it becomes like a documentary drama and it seems like Goya is watching the Indian government's add on a social problem
 film ke na to gane khaas hai or na hi dialogs
 The regret of dialogues is also more because its credit comes in the name of Sanjay Chauhan, who has written films like i Am Kalam, Paan Singh Tomar and Sahib Biwi Gangster
 to final faisla ye he ki bablu hapi dekhakar zyaadaatar log sad ho jaaenge

 Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadir Khan has said that the current situation of Pakistan is worse than 1971
 unhone chetavanee di ki yadi saamaajik buraaiyon ko jald dur nahin kiya gaya to vah din dur nahin, jab ham ek baar phir vighatit ho jaaenge
 Khan, in his article 'events of 1971' written in a magazine, said, 'the condition of the country is worse than 1971 at this time
 yah sabhi prakaar kii saamaajik buraaiyon se trast he
 If we do not remove it soon, then the day is not far when we will disintegrate again
 is sthiti se ubarne ke liye pehla or sabase mahatvapurn aavashyaktaa yah he ki ham khud ko duusare desh ke saath yuddh karne se alag rakhen va apane ghar ko durust karen
 'khan was referring to the indo-pakistan war of 1971, which led to the birth of Bangladesh
 unhone likhaa he ki sabhi deshon ko utaar-chadhaav ke daur se guzarana padataa he
 The glorious period for one is tragic for the other
 log aamtaur par dukh bhare samay ko nazarandaaj kar dete hai or bhul jate hai jabaki achche aayojanon ko dhoomdhaam se manaate hai

 com / v8czaa6q2qkapila sharma (kapil Sharma) ke is episod kaa video soni tivi ne oficial instagram acount par share kiya he
 Many people have watched this video so far
 is video main ek samay aisa aata he jab kapil sharma farah khan se kehete hai ki unhone film 'amar akbar anthony' dekhi hogi, tabhi teen bachche paidaa hue
 Archana Puran Singh with Farah Khan also laughs at him with a laugh
 kapil sharma (kapil Sharma) kii is baat kaa jawaab dete hue farah khan kahati hai agar main 'das' film dekh rahi hoti to kya hota
 Kapil Sharma (farah Khan) then says to Farah Khan that she is still alright if you were watching 'ali Baba 40 Chor'
 kapil ke itnaa kehane bhar se sho main baithe darshakon ke bich jamkar thahaake lagane shuru ho jate hai
 Please tell that on the occasion of Mothers Day, Farah Khan arrived at 'the Kapil Sharma Show'
 is episod ke video khub viral ho rahe hai
 Many times it happens that we are talking to someone special and our conversation takes the form of a quarrel
 kai baar yaa to ham dusron kii baton ko galat samaj lete hai yaa hamen galat samaj liya jaataa he
 In any relationship it is very important to avoid non-essential quarrels
 aaie jaanate hai kaise in jhagadon se bachaa jaae
 
 
 1-find a good time for conversation - Make sure to find a time for conversation in day or night, when there are no more things going on in your mind
 aap donon ek-duusare se acchhee tarah baat kar saken or kisi tarah kaa disterbence naa ho
 2-do not stop each other in between - most of our efforts are to listen to us
 hamaara dhyaan is baat par nahin rahata he ki ham saamne vaale kii baat sunen
 This is a very wrong approach
 aap apni baat rakhen lekin duusare kii baat khatm hone ke baad
 This is the best way to communicate
 3-baatcheet ke bich main uthakar naa chale jaaen-aksar ham gusse main yaa jhallahat main baatcheet ke bich uthakar chale jate hai joki sahi nahin he
 This makes the situation worse and the fight remains unresolved there
 agar kisi mudde par baat kar rahe hai to use puraa karen
 4-try to understand more than answering - This is not a fight in which victory of any one is necessary
 agar aap kisi ladaai main jeetne ke liye bahes kar rahi hai to bhale hi kuch palon ke liye aapako acha mahasoos ho jaae lekin isse samasya nahin sulajhane vaali he
 So instead of trying to answer others, try to understand them
 5-shabdon ke khel naa khelen-aap jo kahana chaahate hai, vahi kahen
 Do not talk at random
 duusari taraf aap yah ummid bhi naa karen ki aapke bina kahe hi doosraa shaks aapke man kii baat samaj le
 The Chief Minister of the state, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, has proved his victory despite showing defeat in the exit poll of assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh
 unhone khud ko sabase bada sarweyre bataate hue ek baar phir se sarkaar banane kaa daawa kiya he
 On the exit poll showing bjp's defeat, Shivraj Singh said, 'I am the biggest surveyor
 main janata kii nabj bhaleebhanti jaanata hum
 i have traveled in Madhya Pradesh and met people
 soobe main bijepi ek baar phir se bahumat se jeet darj karegi or sarkaar banaaegi
 After the Assembly elections held in five states, on Friday, several TV channels showed their exit polls, showing the Congress getting an edge while the BJP was seen as a jerk
 vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey 11 disambar ko aaenge, lekin usase pehle aae eczit pole main bijepi ke liye achche sanket nahin hai
 The BJP, which is in power in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, seems to be bidding farewell
 jabaki congress purna bahumat ke saath satta main vaapasi karti dikh rahi he
 Let me tell you that in the exit poll of India today-axis My India, the Congress in Madhya Pradesh has been shown to be taking the lead
 eczit pole main congress ko 104 se 122 siton par jitate hue dikhaaya he, jabaki BJP ko 102 se 120 siton par jeet milane kaa anumaan jataayaa gaya he
 Competition in the state is visible between the two national parties and other parties may have to be satisfied with only 4 to 11 seats
 agsit pole par tippanee karne se bachate dikhe bijepi netisse pehle agsit pole parkendriya mantri or bijepi ke varisht netaa prakaash jaavdekarkuch bolne se bachate najar aae, jabaki congress ke varisht netaa ashvini kumaar ne kaha ki paanchon rajyon main congress kaa graph badha or bijepi kaa gata he
 Congress will win and BJP will lose
 unhone kaha ki 11 disambar ko jab nattejey aaenge, wo chaunkaane vaale honge
 Senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar said on Saturday, 'I will not react right now as the result will come on December 11
 usee dauraan charchaa karnaa thik rahegaa
 We should wait for the results
 ' unhone kaha ki kai baar aisa hua he jab agsit pole ke nattejey palat gaye hai, isliye hamen 11 disambar ko aane vaale parinaam kaa intjaar karnaa chahie

 vivaadit bayaan dete rahe hai karnataka ke mantri kees ishwarppakarnataka chunaav main muslim ko tikat nahin dene kii baat kahi thikarnataka ke gramin vikaas or panchayat raaj mantri kees ishwarappa ke ek bayaan se bavaal much gaya he
 At an event organized by Shri Ram Sena, KS Eshwarappa said that national devotees would vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) while pro-pakistan Muslims would hesitate to vote for the saffron party
 shri ram sena ke samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue karnataka ke mantri ne kaha, 'bijepi sarkaar ke satta main aane se pehle, main congress ke kuch vidhayakon se mila jinhone bijepi main aane kii ichha vyakt kii thi
 But those Congress leaders said that there are more than 50,000 Muslim votes in their constituencies and they may face defeat if they join BJP
 'kees ishwarappa ne kaha ki unhone congress netaaon se kaha, 'mere nirvachan kshetra main mere samudaay kuruba kaa vot lagbhag 8,000-10,000 he or 50,000 se adhik muslim vot he
 Till date i have not gone to salute any Muslim for votes and i have won by more than 47,000 votes
 ' kees ishwarappa ne kaha ki jo deshbhakt muslim hai wo bijepi ko vot dete hai, lekin pakistan samarthak or anti-neshnal muslim bijepi ko vot nahin karte hai
 Let us know that senior BJP leaders have also been deputy cms and are known for making such disputed statements
 2018 main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle unhone kaha tha ki bijepi karnataka main musalamaanon ko tikat nahin degi kyonki unhen bijepi main vishwaas nahin he
 At the same time, senior Congress leader and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah refused to comment on KS Eshwarappa's statement and said that i will not react to it
 ishwarappa jaise log kya bolte hai, us par maine pratikriya deni band kar di he
 But Congress spokesperson Brijesh Kalappa told Aaj Tak that Eshwarappa does not respect Prime Minister Modi
 piem modi kehete hai ki sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas
 This means that Eshwarappa does not respect PM Modi even a little
 vahiin ishwarappa is vivaadit bayaan ke baad se bijepi damege control main juty hui he
 The party has distanced itself from Eshwarappa's statement and said that this is not the party's stand
 yah unka nijee vichaar he
 Union Minister DV Sadanand Gowda said that BJP follows PM Modi's Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas slogan
 unhone kaha ki jo bhi bharat main rahata he vah bhartiya he or wo sabhi log hamaare hai

 com / ysrwhnqehe congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne maharashtra ke haalia raajnneetik ghatnakramon ko lekar guuruuvaar ko bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa or aarope lagaaya ki rajya main loktantr ko khatm karne kaa ‘besharmi se' prayaas kiya gaya
 Along with this, he said that the Governor acted on the instructions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah
 sutron ke anusaar, sansad bhawan parisar main party sansadeey dal kii baithak main sonia gandhi yah bhi kaha ki rajya main shivasena-rakanpa-congress gathbandhan ko vifal karne kaa har prayaas kiya gaya, lekin supreme court main apil kii gai or modi-shah sarkaar puri tarah benakaab ho gai
 He said that the three parties are united to thwart bjp's efforts
 bataa den, guuruuvaar shaam shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lenge
 Along with him, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and some Congress leaders can also take oath of minister
 rajya main teenon partiyaan milakar nai sarkaar bana rahi hai
 With this, Sonia Gandhi also attacked the Narendra Modi government regarding the state of the economy
 sutron ke anusaar unhone kaha, ‘yah spasht he ki modi-shah sarkaar desh ke saamne pesh chunautiyon se nipatane ko lekar bekhbar hai
 The economic crisis is getting deeper day by day
 vikaas dar gir rahi he, berogari bad rahi he or koi nivesh nahin aa rahaa he
 The Congress president said, "farmers and small and medium businesses are in trouble
" mukhya rup se gramin ilaakon main nivesh gir rahaa he
 Exports are falling
 jaruri vastuon kii keemten badhati ja rahi hai jisase aam logon ko bahut dikkat kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Instead of diagnosing these problems, he claimed, the modi-shah government is engaged in manipulating data or not publishing data
 ' kshetreey samgr aarthik saajhedaari (RCEP) samjhaute kaa ullekh karte hue sonia ne kaha ki congress ke joardaar dhang se aawaaj uthaane ke kaaran ‘modi ko achaanak or paakhandee dhang se gandhi ke sutara kaa gyaan ho gaya
 In addition, he alleged that the Prime Minister and the Home Minister were following 'divisive policies' to divert attention from Assam issues
 sonia ne kaha, ‘naagarikta kanoon main sanshodhan jaise mudde samvidhan kii buniyaad par prahaar hai
 Referring to NRC, he claimed, 'NRC was implemented in Assam under the supervision of the Supreme Court
 isse bhaajapa-aresas kaa agenda puraa nahin hua or sattarudh party main nae sire se NRC kii maang uth rahi he
 The Home Minister is talking about NCR in the whole country, this will create more fear and chaos
 'sonia gandhi ne jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataae jane kaa ullekh karte hue kaha ki jammu-kashmir main nai shuruyaat ke ‘jhuthe vaade' ke saath yah kiya gaya, lekin jamini hakeekat usase bilkul ulat he jo dikhaane kii koshish ho rahi he
 Referring to the arrest of former Finance Minister p Chidambaram, he said that this government is doing politics of revenge
 sonia ne kaha, ‘ham apane liye nahin, balki samvidhan, udaaravaadi evam bahulwaadi loktantr or desh evam janata ke liye ladenge
 ' kisi na kisi vajah se vivaadon main rahane vaale JNU ek baar phis charchaa main he
 This time not because of the Student Union, but because of the fees charged in the entrance examination
 khabar he ki jeenyu ne pravesh pariksha kii fees 27 fisadi badha di he, jise aane vaale academic session se lagu kar diya jayega
 Resignation of second chief proctor in JNU in one year, is this the reason? Jawaharlal Nehru University has increased the entrance examination fees after 13 years
 isse pehle 2003 main fees strecchar ko riviz kiya gaya tha
 This decision has been taken by the admission department of the university
 haalanki yah fees strecchar SC / ST, divyang evam garibi rekha se neeche ke chaatro samet arakshit shreniyon ke ummidavaaron par lagu nahin hoga
 It may be five months before the entrance test in JNU that the application fee of BA program was Rs 420
 ek vishay kaa chunaav karne par 630 rupee or atirikt prograamon kaa chunaav karne par 800 rupee fees deni padati thi, jise badhaakar ab 530 rupee, 800 rupee or 1,000 rupee kar diya gaya he
 jnu's Central Library will be displayed at the Book Fair, similarly the fees for mphil, phd, mtech, msc, MCA and MA programs have been increased from Rs 300 to Rs 400
 atirikt vishyon ke liye chaatro ko kramash: 575 rupee or 750 rupee kaa bhugtan karnaa hoga
 Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj has questioned the appointment of the new Chief Secretary in the Delhi government
 saurabh bharadwaj ne aarope lagaaya he ki jis afasar kii dekharekh main itane bade str par matadaataaon kaa naam hataaya gaya, unako ek saal junior hone ke baavjood kin paristhitiyon main dilli kaa mukhya sachiv banaaya gaya
 Central government is putting pressure on the chief secretary! AAP leader Saurabh Bhardwaj said in a special conversation with 'aaj Tak' that it does not matter who is the chief secretary, but the difference is whether the central government is pressuring the chief secretary
 
 anshu prakaash, mem kutti, keke sharma vyaktigat achche aadmi honge lekin centre sarkaar kaa makasad sirf dilli kikageriwal sarkaarake kaam me adnga daalana he
 Hopefully, the people who are watching this attitude of the Modi government regarding Delhi, they will change their policy
 junior afasar ko mukhya sachiv banane ke peeche sazishasorabh bharadwaj ne sawaal khadey karte hue kaha kimukhya sachivaki niyukti par andeh hota he
 The officer under whose supervision the voters were removed on such a large scale, under which circumstances he was made the Chief Secretary of Delhi despite being a year junior, while the appointment of 86-batch officers was being discussed
 manoj or naresh kumaar ko darkinar karke, ek tay prakriya se hatakar ek saal junior ko mukhya sachiv banane ke peeche centre sarkaar kii vishesh saazish rahi hogi
 Central government should tell what is the special conspiracy behind making junior officer as chief secretary? Central government does not consult AAP on appointment of officers, according to Aam Aadmi Party, Sheila Dixit government and Aam Aadmi Party's 49-day government appointing officers The central government used to consult, but after the Aam Aadmi Party government came in 2015, the elected government should not be consulted in any appointment
 The Minister
 party netaaon kaa aarope he ki dilli sarkaar main aise vyakti ko centre sarkaar niyukt karnaa chaahati he jo kanoon or samvidhan ko taak par rakhkar dilli kii aam aadmi party sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main rukaawat laae
 BJP Aam Aadmi Party leader Raghav Chadha wants to change the Delhi government, during a special conversation with 'aaj Tak', questioning the intention of the central government, that the government of that state is informed on the appointment of a top officer
 lekin durbhagyavash dilli main aisi ghatnaayen ho rahi hai, jahaan kisi bhi vibhaag main adhikari yaa bade afasar kii niyukti se pehle chuni hui sarkaar se salaah mashwara nahin kiya jaataa he
 The BJP government always looks at the change of Delhi government
 mukhyamantri se lekar vidhayakon par jhuthe kesaraghav chaddha ko ummid he ki jab naemukhya sachivsarkaar main shaamil hon or loktantric dhang se chuni hui sarkaar koi faisla le, to afasar un faislon par adnga na lagaaein
 Raghav Chadha said that our hope is always that we stand with those who work for the rights of the people of Delhi
 sari afasarshahi kharaab nahin hai lekin kuch afasar bijepi ke dawaab main aakar sarkaar ko rokane kaa kaam karte hai
 The old Chief Secretary filed false cases against our Chief Minister and mlas
 is tarah ke ravaiye par sawaal uthte hai
 Let us tell you that Delhi Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Vijay Kumar Dev has now been appointed as the Chief Secretary of the Government of Delhi
 vijay kumaar dev agmauti cader ke 1987 batch ke iees adhikari hai
 He has also held important positions in Delhi along with the Chairman of the Transport Corporation, the Mandalayukta of Delhi
 isse pehle anshu prakaash mukhya sachiv the, unke saath hui kathith marpet ke maamle ke baad se hi aam aadmi party (AAP) sarkaar se unki anban chal rahi thi
 Recently, he was transferred to the Telecom Department
 haalanki, kya mukhya sachiv badal jane se dilli sarkaar ke saath chal rahi anban khatm ho jaaegi abhi bhi ye bada sawaal bana hua he
 Because the Aam Aadmi Party government had raised the issue of fake voting list in the recent past and had entered into a tu-tu-main with the Election Commission
 is dauraan dilli ke chunaav ayog kii jimmedaari vijay kumaar dev ke paas hi thi
 That is, once again, the same person has come to the post of Chief Secretary, due to which the old rar of Delhi Government is going on somvaar ko dilli vidhansabha kaa vishesh satrabata den ki dilli sarkaar ne somvaar ko 2 khaas muddon par vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr bulaayaa he
 In the case of Mirchi attack on Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, besides the Delhi Police, the issue of cutting the name from the voter list will be raised by the Aam Aadmi Party mlas
 donon hi muddon ko lekar sadan ke saamne prastaav bhi rakhaa jayega
 While there is news of the size of Mahakal and other Shivling being small in the Shivalayas of our country, there is also a Shivling in Chhattisgarh whose size does not decrease, but increases every year
 yah shivlinga prakritik rup se nirmit he
 Hundreds of kanwadis reach here by hiking every year on Monday falling in the month of Sawan and offering water to this Shivalinga
 soobe ke gariyaaband jile main sthit is shivlinga ko yahaan bhooteshwarnath ke naam se pukaara jaataa he
 Like Dwadash Jyotirligas, it is recognized as an Ardhanarishwara Shivling in Chhattisgarh
 sabase ascharyajanak tathy yah he ki is shivlinga kaa aakaar lagaataar har saal bad rahaa he
 Probably, therefore, the number of devotees walking here every year is constantly increasing
 chhattisgadhi bhashaa main hunkaarne kii aawaaj ko bhakurraa kehete hai, isi se chhattisgadhi main inkaa naam bhakurraa padaa he
 The village Maroda is situated amidst dense forests, three kilometers from Gariaband district headquarters
 suramya wanon evam pahadiyon se ghire anchal main prakruti pradutt vishwa kaa sabase vishaal shivlinga virajman he
 It is said about this Shivling that many years ago, during the Zamindari system, Shobha Singh Zamindar, resident of Paragaon, had cultivation here
 shobhaa singh har shaam apane khet main ghoomane jate the
 Near that field, a special shaped mound used to hear the sound of a bull and the roar of a lion
 kai baar is aawaaj ko sunne ke baad shobhaa singh ne yah baat gramvaasiyon ko bataai
 The villagers also heard the voice many times in the evening
 iske baad aawaaj karne vaale sand athwa sher kii aasapaas khoj kii
 But no animals were found far and wide, then people believed that this mound makes a sound
 log is tile ko shivlinga ke rup main maanane lage
 People in the village say about this that earlier this mound was in small form, gradually increasing its height and roundness, which continues even today
 is shivlinga main prakruti pradat jal lahari bhi dikhaai detii he
 Which is slowly coming on the ground
 yaheen sthaan bhooteshwarnath, bhakura mahadev ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The mythological significance of this Shivling is mentioned in the annual issue of the religious magazine 'kalyan' published from Gorakhpur in 1959, in which it is described as a unique giant Shivling of the world
 yah jameen se lagbhag 18 feet ooncha or 20 feet golakaar he

 mahavitaran rajya ke 2

 43 karod gharelu upabhokta hai
 The decision to cut electricity rates has been decided on the recommendation of a committee headed by the state's Industries Minister Narayan Rane

 Under the university series, we struggled with the question that why no one came to know and why no one is concerned that colleges are ruined, then your children too will be ruined
 iskaa ek kaaran he
 The one who got rich earlier knows the value of studies, so he spends millions and not millions on studies
 do-do karod donneton dekar medical main seat karidata he or lakhon dekar bacchon ko videsh bhej detaa he
 He has come to know that his child will be wasted in these colleges, who do not know that they are still spending millions so that their child reaches the junk colleges here, where neither the master is there nor the level of studies
 aapako pataa hi nahin ki bacchon kii padhai par aapaki das pandrah saal kii mehnat or laagat donon lutane ja rahi he

 kisi uniwarsity main aap 5 se saat saal guzaarte hai tab bhi aap kisi naukari ke laayak banakar nahin nikalate hai, laayak hote hai to naukariyaan nahin nikalati hai
 You will understand this thing exactly ten years from now
 2027 main ki rajya dar rajya kii uniwarsity main aapke bacchon ko barbaad karne ke liye netaaon ne kya badhiya project chalaaya tha
 It will not be known before 2027 even in 2022
 aap lone lekar, pet katkar, auto chalaakar, rickshaw chalaakar, raat din khatkar yahi sochenge ki aapke bachche ne padhai nahin kii
 It is also true that in many places teachers wait, the student does not go to study, but it is more true that there is no teacher at all
 kya aap jaanate hai ki amir bharatiyon ke bachche kahaan padhate hai
 a figure has been published in the Financial Express of November 14, look at it, then you will know why the leaders keep showing you fake dreams day and night
 bhartiya chaatro ne 2016-17 main amareki uniwarsity main 6

 bhartiya rupee main yah raashi 42, 835 karod tak pahunch jaati he
 The entire budget of India's higher education is only 25,000 crores
 bharat kii ucch shiksha ke bajet se kareeb dugani raashi bhartiya chaatr america main nivesh kar rahe hai
 This amount is 30 percent more than in 2015-16
 ek tarah se in chaatro ne bilkul sahi kiya varna yahaan ke kabad collejon main barbaad ho jate
 For twenty years, i have been seeing the same stephens as Hindus
 vahi iaiti or vahi im
 Ten ends at the count of twenty
 inhen das bees ko phir se ginaney kaa ek nayaa jhansa project aayaa he jise angrezi main ranking kehete hai
 When the college itself is not worth it, it is not the master, then who is being told his ranking
 vahi iaiti vahi im ko phir se gina jayega or bhamr paidaa kiya jayega ki desh main shiksha kii haalat sudhar gai he
 Think about three lakh Indian students only invest 42,835 crores in America and our higher education budget is half of that
 singapore se lekar europe ke deshon main bhartiya chaatro kaa bhi nivesh hoga, uskaa to hisaab hi nahin he yahaan
 If Indian colleges are not converted into junk, American colleges do not get such a big market
 yah khel bhi aapako 2027 ke baad samaj aayega
 a female teacher from Delhi University messaged
 9 saal se edock padhaati rahi hai
 When she became pregnant, she taught till the last days
 oparation se baccha hua or 14wein din ke baad hi ve padhaane chali gayi, kyonki unhen maatrutiv avkaash nahin miltaa he
 When you go to Delhi University, where will you beat me sir? 14 november ko dilli uniwarsity ke edock shikshakon ne kulapati karyaalay par hallaa bol kaarykram kiya
 Seeing the presence of people, it seems that these teachers are not confident in their fight
 4000 edock shikshak bataate hai magar kabhi inke andolan main 400 bhi nahin dekha
 Now they have got two groups
 honge hi, inaki asuraksha kis kaam aegi
 First, the same political parties make them unemployed and then divide them and make them their goods
 ek gut ne 9 nabanvar ko pradarshan kiya or ek gut ne 14 november ko
 Within the movement, the game of jugaad and job placement on the basis of ideology and caste is also open in Delhi University
 kisi main saahas nahin ki is door ko chhod de, kaat de to zaahir he unke andolan kii yahi niyati honi he
 Many professors gave jobs to their disciples, outliving someone capable
 jati or dharm kaa khel aap janenge to chakkar aa jayega
 Teacher leaders, who are leading the Halla Bol of 14 November, say that the Executive Council of Delhi University has accommodated adhoc teachers even before bringing Ordinance 13A
 hazaron pad aise hai jin par 10-10 saal se intervyuu nahin hua he
 The court has given several orders but interviews have not taken place
 kuch par to hote hai magar zyaadaatar siton par intervyuu kii prakriya form bharne ke saath hi thandi pad jaati he
 Teachers in many states of India, including Delhi, have done a favor on the education budget by teaching on contract
 ve aadhe adhure paise main na padhaate to shiksha ke itane kam bajet main college main darban bhi nahin miltaa
 In many states, these teachers teach in less than 2 xxrep 4 0 a month, they are getting poor while working for ten years, their political consciousness is getting depleted
 ho chuki he
 Therefore, you must have never seen that the adhoc teachers of Rajasthan supported the Delhiites or the adhoc teachers of Jharkhand or Madhya Pradesh supported the Delhiites
 yah bhi sahi he ki khulkar pradarshan karenge to jo naukari he vah bhi chali jaaegi
 If you conduct a survey among these teachers, then most teachers will be busy in Hindu Muslim debate on news channels
 inaki zindagi barbaad ho gai magar hakeekat ko dekhne kaa nazariyaa nahin paa sake
 In many colleges, professors have fiercely flouted the criteria of quality
 isliye in shikshakon main koi raajnneetik chetana nahin he, jugad chetana he
 Wearing yellow t-shirt, these students are running Lalit Narayan Mithila University Chalo campaign, but the attention keeps going on the yellow t-shirt again and again
 niyat acchhee hone ke baad bhi chaatro kii yahi niyati he
 Confidence in the movement has become so weak that all the emphasis is on communication
 akhbaar main khabar chhapi or twitor par hashtag chalaa or andolan khatm
 By doing the colors, the managers have brightened the movements of the towns but it is important to instill confidence in these students that the bad condition of the university of their city has to be corrected
 ye kaam na to ek din main hoga, na ek maheene main
 They also have to understand their demands
 central uniwarsity banane kii maang kar rahe hai magar usase kya ho jayega
 Is there a central university that is in good condition? jahaan shikshak hai
 In any Central University, 30 percent of the posts will be vacant at any time and in the Universities of the states, 50 percent of the posts will be vacant
 vaais chancelar aish karne kaa pad ho gaya he
 No one has more work left than to welcome the Chief Minister in colleges and garland the minister
 acchhee baat he ki ye noujvaan shuruyaat kar rahe hai
 They want the class to be regular, come on time, have new course books and hostel arrangements
 mithilanchal kii is uniwarsity par hamane uniwarsity series main charchaa kii thi
 There were supposed to be 57 professors in Marwari College Darumbhaga, but 43 are vacant
 alenje college jhanjharpur main 37 main 31 pad khaali hai
 Of late, the Mithila Student Union has taken the initiative, if they continue to live like this, then what will be the result, but it should not happen that the wi-fi will not come and the professor does not come
 philhal pehle din ke hisaab se to yahi lagata he ki inti taiyaari safal rahi he
 The comments vahiin darbhanga main aaj chaatr sanghathan isa ne mithila uniwarsity ke saamne pradarshan kiya
 AISA has taken the Student Youth Rights Tour from Chandigarh to Kolkata
 7 nanvabar se lekar 21 november ke bich yah yatra upi, bihar or bengal ke kai shaharon se hokar guzaregi
 This trip has also reached colleges in Ara Muzaffarpur
 isamen isa kii sucheta de hai jo jawahar laal nehru uniwarsity kii adhyaksh bhi rah chuki hai
 Their slogan is, 'education is not employment, it is not hatred and not rights'
 in naaron main yah bhi jhalakana chahie tha ki college ke college shikshakon se khaali hai
 Teachers are not getting salary
 padhai kii quality bahut karaab he
 The problem is that student union elections are closed everywhere, except in JNU, those elections are less management
 chaatr raajnneeti ko apane collejon kii haalat se khud ko jodna hoga
 Otherwise, the yellow and red movements will pass but will not be affected
 hamaare sahyogi susheel mahapatra ne association of indian uniwarsity ke secetry general phurkan qamar se baat kii
 The Association of Indian Universities is the representative institution of Indian universities
 unhone haal hi main moulana azaad memorial lacture diya tha
 In which it was said that 30 percent of the posts remain vacant at any time in any central university and institutions of national importance
