 ek chaityas ek buddha yaa jain mandir he jisame ek stupa samahit hota he
 In modern texts related to Indian architecture, the word chaityagriha is used for places of worship or prayer places where a stupa is present
 chaityas kii vaastukala or stambh or mehrab vaali roman dizin avadharana me samantaayein dikhti hai
 Chaitya, derived from Sanskrit 'chita'
 is shabd kaa sambandh mulat: chita yaa chita se sambandhit vastuon se he 
 The ancient tradition of building a memorial building or plantation on the pyre site or on the ashes of a dead person has been mentioned in Brahmin, Buddhist and Jain literature
 ramayana, mahabharat or bhagavadgita main is shabd kaa prayog paavan vedi, devsthan, prasaad, dharmik vriksh aadi ke liye hua he- devsthaneshu chaityeshu naganamalayeshu c, prasdgopursabhachaityadev grihaadishu,, kanchiaityashatarjusht: ; chaityaupankita bhoomiryasyeyan savanakra 
 Among the Buddhists and Jains, the tradition of building a sacred memory-building at the tomb of a bhikkhu or ascetic was followed
 falat: unke sahitya main is tarah ke prasangon kaa bahush: ullekh hua he
 Gradually, this word started being used for stupas
 buddha dharm ke prachaar or prasar ke saath chaityanirmaan kaa pravesh anya deshon main hua
 In Sri Lanka, the words 'dagba' and 'dungatein' were popularized in Tibet
 chaityas shabd kaa prayog kalantar main kisi paavan sthaan, mandir, asthipaatr athwa pavitra vriksh ke liye bhi hone laga
 Modern archaeologists commonly use the term to refer to a Buddhist or Jain temple, although in Buddhist architecture, a building built in a specific style is called Chaityaprasad in which stupas were installed for worship
 is tarah chaityaprasaadon ke nirmaan ke mul main bhi vahi dharmik bhaavana thi
 Ferguson is of the opinion that Buddhist Chaityaprasad of places like Bhaja, Nashik, Ellora, Karle etc
 are very close to the Girjaghars
 unki rachanastyli, vedi yaa garbhagrih, mandap aadi main kaaphi samanta he, yadhyapi chaityon kaa nirmaan girjagharon ke bahut pehle se hi aarambh ho gaya tha
 a special similarity is found in the sanctum sanctorum of the sanctum sanctorum, mandapa and pradakshinapatha and also in the Chaityaprasad and Hindu temples
 chaityaprasaad ke ardhavritakar bhaag main sthapit stupa upasna kaa centre hota tha
 From the side of the stupa, there was an effervescence, which was separated from it by columns
 prasaad kaa aadhaar vrittakar hota tha
 In its initial form, Chaityaprasad wood was made, which is mentioned in Ramayana and Buddhist and Jain literature equally
 kalantar main inhen sthaayee rup dene kii bhaavana se prerit nirmaataaon ne samooche chaityaprasaad kii sajiv kalpana thos chattaanon main aarambh kar di1 khadey parvat kii chattaane tarashkar unamem kala kaa ek nayaa sansar rachaa jane laga
 Large pavilions, pillars, stupas were built within them
 lekhon main inhen selghar, chetiyar, sellmandap aadi kaha gaya he
 Although initially the chaityagriha was wooded in this direction and the wooden bases and joints were also unnecessarily engraved into the stones, as is evident from the grand chaityaprasadas of Bhaja, Kondane and Carle, but later that unnecessary constructions Was abandoned

 According to the scriptures, Shani Dev was born from the womb of the shadow of the sun's wife, noun, when Shani Dev was in the womb of the shadow, then the shadow was so much devoted to the devotion of Lord Shankar that he did not purify himself until he ate his food, which effected his son
 But his character became black and when he saw the black moon of Saturn, Surya accused his wife Chhaya that Shani is not my son! Since then Shani used to be hostile to his father! Shani Dev got power like his father Surya by pleasing Lord Shiva through his spiritual penance and Shivji asked Shani Dev to ask for a boon, then Shani Dev prayed that my mother Chhaya is being defeated in ages, Father has been insulted many times by Father Surya! So mother's wish is that my son avenge my insults to his father and become even more powerful than him! Then Lord Shankar gave a boon and said that you will have the best place among the Navagrahas! Human beings, will the gods also be afraid of your name! For more information see link Shani shani ke sambandh me hame puraanon main anek aakhyaan milte hai

 janm kundali ke baarah bhaavon me janm ke samay shani apni gati or jataka ko diye jane vaale falon ke prati bhavanusaar jataka ke jivan ke andar kya utaar or chadhaav milenge, sabakaa vrutant kah detaa he
 Saturn is cool and Saturn is the one to give coolness, the name of Sun is bright and the name of Saturn is dark, the reason for making its place in the first house is that Shani will cause mourning in the speed of its transit and in its condition, as soon as the suffering of mourning in the creature comes He forgets everything back and forth and remains lost only in the dark
 shani jaadu tone kaa kaarak tab ban jaataa he, jab shani pehle bhav me apni gati detaa he, pehla bhav hi aukaat hoti he, andhere me jab aukaat chupane lage, roshni se hi pahichaan hoti he or jab aukaat chuphi hui ho to shani kaa syah andheraa hi mana ja saktaa he
 There are many forms of darkness, a darkness is one which causes nothing to be seen, it is considered to be the darkness of the eyes, one is also to understand the darkness, there is something in front, and something is understood, a darkness Evil is the reason, the goodness of a person or a creature is hidden in the evils, it is also considered as the darkness of Saturn, the name is dark, no one knows who it is And where has come from, who is mother and who is father, etc
 The concealment in any form is also considered due to Saturn, the person becomes the effigy of cunning by Saturn of the first house
 By placing a position inside the house, one looks at the third house, the third one is of his younger brother and sister, also of his inner strength, and also of might, whatever we say to others, any means
 s , In any way, due to Saturn, there is a difficulty in communicating his words, what is said is not understood either by the person in front, and even if he comes, then due to a terrible darkness, he does not say the said thing
 Because of understanding, one gets some sense of something, even the fruit which is not found in the result is found, it is often seen that the one who is Saturn in the first house, his life partner starts speaking loudly, the reason for that
 By not having the habit of speaking loudly, Saturn of the first house lacks in hearing, and either speaks it out loud to the front, or he understands something, that's why the life partner Along with listening to something and understanding something, the result of mental misunderstanding dissolves in relationships, and relationships break down
 And even if it comes, due to a terrible darkness, he understands something because of not understanding what is said, the result is not getting what he wants, it is often seen that Saturn would be in the first house
 Is, his life partner starts to speak loudly, his reason is not his habit of speaking loudly, the first house Saturn reduces in hearing, and only when the front person speaks loudly Naii gives or takes some understanding of some, dissolves bitterly on why the result of listening to some with spouses and deemed mentally not to understand why some relationships, and relationships are broken
 And even if it comes, due to a terrible darkness, he understands something because of not understanding what is said, the result is not getting what he wants, it is often seen that Saturn would be in the first house
 Is, his life partner starts to speak loudly, his reason is not his habit of speaking loudly, the first house Saturn reduces in hearing, and only when the front person speaks loudly Naii gives or takes some understanding of some, dissolves bitterly on why the result of listening to some with spouses and deemed mentally not to understand why some relationships, and relationships are broken
 isaki pratham bhav se dasvi najar sidhi karm bhav par padati he, yahi karm bhav hi pita kaa bhav bhi hota he
 The person has to face a lot of difficulty in performing karma and understanding karma, when karma is not understood in any way, then whatever is done is considered to be a form of weight rather than karma, the same thing towards father It is assumed that Saturn gives darkness to the father according to its size, and because of that darkness, what the father has done to the son, due to lack of understanding, the father also maintains discord in the son, The Saturn in the house of Saturn or the 1st house goes to the fourth house of the mother, and the work which the mother should not do, she has to do it, her life is tied in a circle due to the work done by the mother by staying difficult and in a limit
 It remains, and she is unable to use her body sift in the way an ordinary man wants to live her life
 doosraa bhav bhautik dhan kaa bhav he,bhautik dhan se matlab he,rupaya,paisa,sona,chandi,hira,moti,jevaraat aadi, jab shani dev duusare bhav me hote he to apane hi parivaar waalo ke prati andheraa bhi rakhte he, apane hi parivaar waalon se ladai jhagadaa aadi karvaa kar apane ko apane hi parivaar se dur kar dete hai,dhan ke maamle mai pataa nahi chalata he kitna aayaa or kitna kharch kiya, kitna kahaan se aayaa,doosraa bhav hi bolne kaa bhav he, jo bhi baat kii jaati he, uskaa andaaj nahi hota he ki kya kaha gaya he, gaali bhi ho sakati he or thandi baat bhi, thandi baat se matlab he nakaaratmak baat, kisi bhi baat ko karne ke liye kaha jaay, uttar main na hi nikle
doosraa shani chauthe bhav ko bhi dekhtaa he, chauthaa bhav mata, makaan, or vaahan kaa bhi hota he, apane sukhon ke prati bhi chauthe bhav se pataa kiya jaataa he, doosraa shani hone par yatra vaale kaary or ghar me sone ke alaava or kuch nahi dikhaai detaa he
 Second Saturn looks directly at the eighth house, the eighth house tends towards the cremation forces, the person puts his mind in adopting the ghosts, ghosts, jinn and vampiric powers, due to shamani cultivation, he should also be a caterer
 Goes, his interest in wine, kebabs and ghost food increases
 doosraa shani gyarahawein bhav ko bhi dekhtaa he, gyarahavaan bhav achal sampatti ke prati apni aasthaa ko andhere me rakhata he, mitron or bade bhai bahino ke prati dimag main andheraa rakhata he
 They want to do something but understand something else in the person's mind
 teesraa bhav parakram kaa he, vyakti ke saahas or himmat kaa he, jahaan bhi vyakti rahata he, uske padausiyon kaa he
 Within the reasons of all these, Saturn also sees the fifth house from the third house, in which education, children and quick money are also known, the participation of friends and the sister-in-law are also considered as the fifth house, the death of the father and Dada's elder brother's sentiment is also fifth
 iske alaava nawein bhav ko bhi teesraa shani aahat karata he, jisame dharm, saamaajik vyavharikta, puraane reeti rivaaj or paariwarik chalan aadi kaa gyaan bhi miltaa he, ko teesraa shani aahat karata he
 This Saturn proclaims its darkened policy towards houses and resting places
 nanihaal khandaan ko yah shani pratadit karata he
 The main effect of the fourth house is very troublesome for the person, mother, mind, house, and water resources, and the water of the body is dirty with the effect of this Saturn, due to being a lifelong painter, the person with this Shani in the Puranas Life of hell is told only
 agar yah shani tula,makar,kumbh yaa min kaa hota he, to is ke fal main kashton me kuch kami aa jaati he
 Due to the presence of Saturn in this sense, a person makes a mantra, he becomes a benefactor of the people through many deep mantras, but for his life partner, property, and cash
 It only hurts for the accumulated capital
 santan me shani kii sift stri hone or thandi hone ke kaaran se santati me vilamb hota he,kanya santan kii adhikta hoti he, jivan saathi ke saath man mutaav hone se vah adhik tar apane jivan ke prati udasin hi rahata he
 In this sense, Shani becomes the giver of many divine and physical diseases, but Saturn in this house ends family hostility, maternal uncle is about to end family, uncle is never formed from family
 vyakti agar kisi prakaar se naukari vaale kaamon ko karata rahata he to safal hota rahata he, agar kisi prakaar se vah maaliki vaale kaamo ko karata he to vah asafal ho jaataa he
 Because of seeing the eighth house from the third point of view, a person is not able to understand any work or problem from a distant vision, whatever he earns by not understanding the risk towards himself in some way or other, by the actions
 Goes, remains blind towards him, and accidentally loses whichever is nearby due to problems
 barahave bhav me andheraa hone ke kaaran se bahari aafaton ke prati bhi anjaan rahata he, jo bhi kaaran bahari banate hai unke dwaara yaa to thaga jaataa he yaa bahari logon kii shani vaali chaalaakiyon ke kaaran apane ko aahat hi paata he
 The younger brother and sister are unaware of what they are doing and what their working system is towards themselves

 And not only this, those who have done good deeds, then also give sardhati prizes to them, such as being made the head of a city or village or the city, etc
 Sanyasati's narrative of Shani is received by many people, like King Vikramaditya, Raja Nal, King Harishchandra, also harasses Saturn's saintly saintly Mahatmas, who begin to indulge in Joga along with Bhoga
 har manushya ko tees saal me ek baar sadhesati avashya aati he, yadi yah saade saati dhanu, min, makar, kumbh raashi me hoti he, to kam peedajanak hoti he, yadi yah sadhesati chauthe, chathe, aathven, or barahawein bhav main hogi, to jataka ko avashya dukhi karegi, or tino sukh shaareerik, maansik, or aarthik ko haran karegi
in sadhesatiyon main kabhi bhuulakar bhi "neelam" nahi dhaaran karnaa chaiye, yadi kiya gaya to vajaay laabh ke haani hone kii puri sambhaavna hoti he
 Do not forget any new work, new industry, even in a half-century, before doing any work, you must get information from a knowledgeable astrologer
 Even you should not forget to buy a vehicle in this time, otherwise that vehicle Instead of being a vehicle of happiness, it will become a vehicle of sorrows
 We have seen in our last twenty-five years experience that how many industrialists in Sadhesati were in bad condition, and those who were crorepatis, they were road Then it started moving in a pot
 In this way, it was also realized that whenever Saturn is moving in four, six, eight, twelve, then its original wealth will be destroyed, no matter how much should be done

 To avoid the wrath of Lord Ravi, Ravana tied him with his legs in his captivity and turned his head downwards
 It was kept so that the curve of Saturn would not fall on Ravana
 aaj bhi kai hindu jane anjaane ravan kii bhaanti pratikatmak taur pe shani praturup ko dukaanon yaa vaahanon main pairon se baandh kar ulta latakaate hai
 Although the mythological suggestion is to do devotion to Shree Hanuman, because Shani Dev gave a boon to Hanuman ji that Hanuman devotees would not have a curved vision of Shani

 And such a person is disgusted with family attachment and gives disinterest by making a great saint
 shani purv janm ke tap ko purna karne ke liye praani kii samast manovritiyon ko paramatma main lagane ke liye manushya ko ant rahit bhav dekar ucch stareey mahatma bana detaa he
 So that his penance is successful in the present birth, and he can enjoy the joy of ecstasy and get the good fortune of the Lord Darshan

 And Saturn places his mind in the divine

 chothe bhaag- MODIFY me vidhyaarthee apni kala kaa prayog karke pratham vichaar ko sanshodhit kar sake
 In part-put TO OTHER USE, students write about other uses of the first idea

 He is called the 'veteran Man of India'
 1892 se 1895 tak ve united kingdom ke house aav comons ke sadsy the
 Dadabhai Naoroji studied at the Elphinstone Institute in the days before the establishment of universities in India where he was a brilliant student
 usee santhaan main adhyaaapak ke rup main jivan aarambh kar aage chalakar vahiin ve ganit ke professor hue, jo un dinon bharatiyon ke liye shaikshanik sansthaaon main sarvocch pad tha
 Together, he made a special place as a pioneer in social reform work and in the establishment of many religious and literary organizations, such as "students Literary and Scientific Society"

 He was also the founder of Rahunmai
 ' "raast gaftaar' naamak apane samay ke samaaj sudhaarkon ke pramukh patr kaa sampadan tathaa sanchaalan bhi inhone kiya
 Famous for their charity and enlightenment in the history of the Zoroastrians, the "camas' brothers invited Dadabhai to partner in their trade
 tadnusaar dadabhai landan or liverpool main unka karyaalay sthapit karne ke liye england gaye
 Leaving the school environment abruptly known as merchant money may be considered a kind of downfall or deviation, but Dada Bhai saw the occasion as suitable for the well-being of students going to higher education in England
 iske saath hi saath unka doosraa uddeshy sarkari prashaskeey sansthaaon kaa adhik se adhik bhartiyakaran karne ke liye andolan chalaane kaa bhi tha
 Among the students who came in contact with him in those days and were impressed by him are the names of the famous Ferozeshah Mehta, Mohandas Karmchand Gandhi and Muhammad Ali Jina
 iske atirikt dadabhai kaa ek or uddeshy british janata ko british shashan se utpeedit bharatiyon ke du:khon kii jaankaree karana or unhen dur karne ke unke uttardaayitv kii ore dhyaan aakarshith karana bhi tha
 In those days, the most difficult thing for the aspirants to join the Indian Civil Services was that they had to compete with the British candidates in adverse conditions
 is asuvidha ko dur karne ke liye dada bhai kaa suzav england or bharat main ek saath civil sarvice pariksha karne kaa tha
 For this, he campaigned till 1893 when he struggled there more than as a member of that House in the Lok Sabha and the Assembly accepted the proposal to conduct the examination simultaneously in India and England
 un dinon duusari usase bhi badi parivednaa bharatiyon kii bhayanak daridrata thi
 Although Dadabhai was not the first person who expressed anguish for it, he was the first to launch a movement to eradicate it
 unhone tathyon or aankadon se yah siddh kar diya ki jahaan bhartiya daridrata main aakanth duube the, vahiin bharat kii prashaskeey seva duniyaan main sabase mahangi thi
 Government statistics were not the same in those days and there was no non-official means to get information
 bharatiyon kii aarthik sthiti ke sambandh main praarambhik surveykshan ke baad yahi nishkarsh niklaa ki desh main ek vyakti kii ausat vaarshik aay kul bees rupye thi
 On the basis of all these figures, in front of the East India Association, he read the essay "wants and Means on India" on 27 July 1870
 19veen shatabdi ke ant tak dadabhai ne anek samitiyon or aayogon ke samaksh hi nahin varan british parliament ke saamne bhi bharat ke prati kii gai buraaiyon ko dur karne ke liye vakaalat kii or ucchadhikariyon ko baraabar chetavanee dete rahe ki yadi isi prakaar bharat kii naitik or bhautik rup se avnati hoti rahi to bharatiyon ko british vastuon kaa hi nahin varan british shashan kaa bhi bahishkaar karne ke liye baadhya hona padegaa, kintu iskaa koi prabhaav nahin padaa
 In the end, he decided to make a great effort to attract the attention of world public opinion towards the political slavery and pitiable situation of Indians, which resulted in his magnum opus Poverty and un-british Rule in India
 isamen bahut se lekh, bhaashan, niabandh or ucchadhikariyon se patravyavhaar tathaa samitiyon or aayogon ke samaksh di gai unki gavaahiyaan tathaa kitne hi mahatvapurn adhiniyamon or ghoshnaaon ke uddhran the
 His amazing success in gaining membership of the House of Commons was merely a means for goal-seeking
 unka yah lakshya yaa dhyey tha bharat kaa kalyaan or unnati jo sansad kii sadsyta ke liye sangharsh karte samay bhi unke mastishk par chaaya rahata tha
 He continued to campaign for the National Congress and in various letters to his friends in India condemned the Zoroastrian tendency to stay away from the national struggle
 koi bhi saptaah aisa nahin bitta tha jisamen unke paas bharat se patr or congress ke sambandh main patrapatrikaon kii kataranen na aati rahi hon tathaa unke patr bhartiya mitron ke paas na pahonchte rahe hon
 Nobody had ever expected that Dadabhai would create such a huge stir in the House of Commons, but his activity and activism in that House seemed as if he had been familiar with the functioning of the house long before
 bharat kii daridrata, mudra or vinimay, opium yaa sharaab ke seven ke protsaahan se utpann honevaale kuprinaamon ke vishay main unke bhaashan bade aadar or dhyaan se sune jate the
 It is not possible here to describe all the many things that Dadabhai has done for the service of the country in his long life, but it is necessary to discuss the demand made by him in the Calcutta session of the All India Congress for self-government
 unhone apane bhaashan main swarajya ko mukhya sthaan diya
 During his speech, he said, we are not pleading for any grace, we only need justice
 aarambh se hi apane prayatnon ke dauraan main mujhe itani asafalataayen mili hai jo ek vyakti ko niraash hi nahin balki vidrohi bhi bana dene ke liye paryaapt thim, par main hataash nahin hua hoon or mujhe vishwaas he ki us thode se samay ke bheetar hi, jab tak mai jivit hoon, sadbhaavna, sachaai tathaa sanman se paripurna swayatt shashan kii maang ko paripurna, karanevaala samvidhan bharat ke liye sweekaar kar liya jayega
 His hope was fulfilled when he retired from public life
 purv or pashchim main congressi kaaryakarta tathaa unke mitra bharat kii nai peedi kii aashaaon ke anusaar sanvaidhanik sudhaaron ko moort rup dene ke liye prastaav taiyaar karne main vyast the
 But two months before the announcement of 20 August 1917, Dadabhai had died
 is ghoshnaa ke dwaara prashasnic sevaaon main adhikadhik bhartiya sahyog tathaa british samrajya ke antargat kramash: bharat main uttaradaayi shashan ke vikaas ke liye maarg prashast hua
 Thus, this veteran leader of India was assured of a lot of demand

 Dardi or Dardic languages are a subdivision of indo-aryan languages, whose most well-known language is Kashmiri
 dardi bhashaayen uttari pakistan, uttar-purvi afghanistan or bharat ke jammu-kashmir rajya main boli jaatin hai
 Among all the Dardi languages, the status of Kashmiri is the highest because it has its own popular literature and also has the honor of being an official language of India
 pakistan ke chitral zile kii khovaar bhashaa, uttari kashmir main boli jane vaali shina bhashaa or afghanistan ke purvi nuristaan, nangarhaar or kunar rajyon main boli jane vaali pashai bhashaa anya mashhoor dardi bhashaayen hai
 There are no two opinions that Sanskrit, Persian, Punjabi, hindi-urdu etc
 have influence on almost all Dardi languages and many of their words are used in Dardi languages
 lekin bahut bhashavaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ke dardi bhashaaon ne bhi gair-dardi hindi-arya bhashaaon par apni chhap chodi he
 It is believed that some dialects of Punjabi, Uttarakhand and some other languages have an influence on Dardi
 haalanki is par vivaad jari he, lekin ek dharna yah bhi he ki pracheen kaal main dardi ek bahut bade kshetra main boli jaati thi jo sindhu nadi ke ird-gird or phir himachal or uttarakhand main failaa hua tha
 There are some special things in Dardi languages that make their identity in the entire indo-aryan language family, such that mahapraan consonants are pronounced like hypnotic consonants
 zyaadaatar hid-arya bhashaaon main mahapraan vyanjanon ko vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjan 'kha' ko munh se vaayu-pravaah se bolaa jaataa he jabaki uske milte hue alpapraan vyanjan 'k' ko bahut kam vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he
 This is not the case in Dardic languages
 in bhashaaon main vaayu-pravaah kii bajaay sur badal ke alpapraan or mahapraan vyanjanon main antar kiya jaataa he
 For example, where the word 'bhoomi' is in Sanskrit, there is 'buum' in the Khovar language, in which the voice goes from thick voice to thin tone
 isi tarah se jahaan hindi main mahapraani 'dha' se 'dhuaan' hota he vahaan pashai main alpapraani 'da' se 'duum' hota he
 In Kashmiri there is 'dod' instead of 'milk' in Sanskrit and 'milk' in Hindi
 pashchimi pahari ore punjabi main bhi isi tarah mahapraan ke sthaan par swar-badlaav dekhne ko miltaa he, jaise kii punjabi main hindi ke 'ghar' kii jagah swar badalata hua shabd 'kar' hota he
 Dardi languages often have syllable shifting, in which a vowel around the letter 'r' of the same word changes its place
 yah dardi bhashaaon main prachinkaal se hota aa rahaa he or gandhar kshetra main samraat ashok ke jamaane kii shilaon main bhi yah dekha ja saktaa he, jo 269 ipu se 231 ipu main khadi kii gai thim
 One title of Emperor Ashoka was 'priyadarshi' - but 'priyadrashi' is often seen on these rocks because of the syllable shifting, 'darsha' of 'darsha' became
 isi tarah in shilaon par 'dharm' ke sthaan par 'dhram' miltaa he
 In modern times, the word 'long' in Sanskrit can be seen in the word 'drig' in Kalash languages
 palula bhashaa main sanskrit kaa 'durbal' badal kar 'druble' ban jaataa he or sanskrit kaa 'bhurj' badal kar 'barhuj' ban jaataa he
 The ‘poor’ of Sanskrit becomes ‘drolid’ of Kashmiri and ‘karma’ becomes ‘kram’ in Kashmiri
 dardi bhashaaon kii yah pravriti punjabi or pashchimi pahari bhashaaon main bhi kuch had tak dekhi ja sakati he
 In Persian, where the tree is called 'dukht', in Punjabi it becomes 'drakht'
 adhiktar hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he
 But in Dardic languages, verb words come in the middle of a sentence
 is maamle main dardi bhashaayen angrezi kii tarah hotin hai
 In the sentences written above, the verb is written in thick letters
 jaisaa kii spasht he, lagbhag sari hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he, lekin dardik is niyam ko bhang karti he or angrezi kii tarah kriya ko sangya ke baad daalati he
 Such languages that are inserted after the verb noun are called "verb second languages"

 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous

 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 799 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kali Yuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc
