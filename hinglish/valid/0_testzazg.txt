 vidhyalay vah sthal he jahaan shiksha pradaan kii jaati he
 "" The school is an institution where the physical, mental, intellectual and moral qualities of children are developed
 ' vidhyalay' shabd ke liye angl bhashaa main 'skool' shabd kaa prayog hota he, jisaki utpatti greek shabd 'skohla'yaa 'skhole' se hui he, jis se taatpary he- 'avkaash'
 yah arth kuch vicitra - sa lagata he parantu vaastaviktaa ko to yah he ki pracheen yunaan main avkaash ke sthalon ko hi vidhyalay ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa tha
 avkaash kaal ko hi 'aatm -vikaas' samajha jaataa tha, jiskaa abhyaas avkaash naam nishchit sthaan par kiya jaataa tha dhire-dhire yahi avkaash sthal ek nishchit uddeshy tathaa paathyakram kaa gyaan pradaan karne vaali sansthaaen arthath skool ban gaye
 History is particularly used in two ways
 ek he pracheen athwa vigat kaal kii ghatnaayen or doosraa un ghatnaon ke vishay main dharna
 The word history implies "it was sure"
 greece ke log itihaas ke liye "histari" shabd kaa prayog karte the
 "histari" literally meant "weave"
 anumaan hota he ki gyaat ghatnaon ko vyavasthit dhang se bunakar aisa chitra upasthit karne kii koshish kii jaati thi jo sarthak or susambaddha ho
 Thus the word history means anecdote group, veeragatha or historical evidence derived from tradition
 itihaas ke antargat ham jis vishay kaa adhyayan karte hai usamen ab tak ghatit ghatnaon yaa usase sambandh rakhanevaali ghatnaon kaa kalkrmanusaar varnan hota he
 In other words, history is the name of specific human events
 yaa phir pracheenta se naveenta kii ore aane vaali, maanavjaati se sambandhit ghatnaon kaa varnan itihaas he
 These events and historical evidence are proved on the basis of fact
 itihaas ke mukhya aadhaar yugavishesh or ghatnasthal ke ve avshesh hai jo kisi na kisi rup main praapt hote hai

 The summary is that in the creation of history, there is a need for adequate material, scientific investigation, the discretion to understand the importance of the knowledge gained from it, as well as the power of historical imagination and the ability to depict life
 samaran rakhana chahie ki itihaas na to saadhaaran paribhaasha ke anusaar vigyaan he or na keval kaalpanik darshan athwa saahitiyik rachana he
 The history of these is formed by proper mixing

 Now efforts and efforts are being made on this side that if possible, not only the civilized world, but only the collective development or destruction of human beings should be studied like geography
 is dhyey kii siddh yadhyapi asambhav nahin, tathaapi badi dustar he
 Its primary map conjectures that a satisfactory history of the world requires a very long time, effort, and organization

 kalaram mandir andolan main lagbhag 15,000 swayamsevak ikatthe hue, jisase nashik kii sabase badi prakriyaayein huin
 The procession was led by a military band, a batch of scouts, women and men marched in discipline, order and determination to see God for the first time
 jab ve dwaar tak pahunche, to dwaar brahman adhikariyon dwaara band kar die gaye
 By now, Bhimrao Ambedkar had become the biggest untouchable political figure till date
 unhone mukhyadhara ke mahatvapurn raajnneetik dalon kii jati vyavastha ke unmoolan ke prati unki kathith udaseenta kii katu aalochana kii
 Ambedkar also criticized the Indian National Congress and its leader Mahatma Gandhi, accusing them of presenting the untouchable community as an object of compassion
 ambedkar british shashan kii vifaltaaon se bhi asantusht the, unhone achhut samudaay ke liye ek aisi alag raajnneetik pahchaan kii vakaalat kii jisame congress or british donon kii hi koi dakhal naa ho
 Ambedkar put his political vision in front of the world during the first round table conference on 8 August 1930 in London, according to which the protection of the exploited class is in its independence from both the government and the Congress
 hamen apana rasta swayan bananaa hoga or swayan


 raajnneetik shakti shoshito kii samasyaon kaa nivaaran nahin ho sakati, unka uddhaar samaaj me unka uchit sthaan paane main nihit he
 They have to change their bad way of living 


 They must be educated 


 a great need is to shake their sense of inferiority and to instill in them the divine dissatisfaction which is the source of all heights
 ambedkar ne congress or gandhi dwaara chalaaye gayi namak satyagrah kii aalochana kii
 Due to the increasing popularity and public support among his untouchable community, he was also invited to attend the second round table conference in London in 1931
 vahaan unki achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene ke mudde par gandhi se tikhi bahes hui
 But Brido agreed with Ambedkar's ideas
 dharm or jati ke aadhaar par pruthak nirvaachika dene ke prabal virdohi gandhi ne ashanka jataai, ki achhuton ko di gayi pruthak nirvaachika, hindu samaaj ko vibhajit kar degi
 Gandhi felt that the Savarnas should be given some period of their heart-rending to forget untouchability, but this argument was proved wrong when untouchability continued to be practiced by the upper-caste Hindus even decades after the Poona Pact
 1932 main jab britishon ne ambedkar ke vichaaron ke saath sahmati vyakt karte huye achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The announcement of the Communal Award was the result of discussions at the Round Table Conference
 is samjhaute ke tahat ambedkar dwaara uthaai gai rajnatik pratinidhitiv kii maang ko maanate hue pruthak nirvaachika main dalit varg ko do voton kaa adhikaar pradaan kiya gaya
 Under this, Dalits could choose their representative by one vote and by another vote, there was freedom to choose representative of general class
 is prakaar dalit pratinidhi keval daliton kii hi vot se chunaa janaa tha
 With this provision, there was no longer any interference from the general class in choosing the Dalit representative
 lekin vahiin dalit varg apni duusari vot kaa istemaal karte hue saamaanya varg ke pratinidhi ko chunane se apni bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the Dalit candidate chosen by the Dalits could have kept the problems of Dalits well, but it was not necessary for the non-candidate to try to solve their problems
 gandhi is samay puna kii yeravada jail main the
 As soon as the announcement of the communal award, Gandhi first wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and demanded that it be changed
 lekin jab unako laga ki unki maang par koi amal nahin kiya ja rahaa he to unhone maran vrath rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Then Ambedkar said that "if Gandhi had kept this fast for the freedom of the country, it would have been good, but he has kept this fast in protest against the Dalit people, which is very regrettable
" jabaki bhartiya isaayiyo, musalamaanon or sikhon ko mili isi adhikaar ko lekar gandhi kii ore se koi aapatti nahin ai
 "he also said that Gandhi is not an immortal person
 bharat main na jane kitne aise logon ne janm liya or chale gaye
 Ambedkar said that he cannot renounce the interests of Dalits to save Gandhi's life
 ab maran vrath ke kaaran gandhi kii tabiyat lagaataar bigad rahi thi
 Gandhi's life was in great distress
 or puraa hindu samaaj ambedkar kaa virdohi ban gaya
 Seeing the increasing pressure in the country, Ambedkar reached Yerwada jail at 5 pm on 24 September 1932
 yahaan gandhi or ambedkar ke bich samjhauta hua, jo baad main puna pact ke naam se janaa gaya
 In this agreement, Ambedkar announced to waive the right to separate electorate received by the Dalits in the Communal Award
 lekin iske saath hin communal award se mili 78 arakshit siton kii bajaay puna pact main arakshit siton kii sankhya badha kar 148 karvaa lee
 Along with this, for the untouchables, adequate amount was allocated in education grant in every province and ensured the recruitment of Dalit people without any discrimination from government jobs and in this way Ambedkar saved the life of Mahatma Gandhi
 ambedkar is samjhaute se asamaadhani the, unhone gandhi ke is anshan ko achhuton ko unke raajnneetik adhikaron se vanchit karne or unhen unki maang se peeche hatane ke liye dawaab daalane ke liye gandhi dwaara khelaa gaya ek naatak qaraar diya
 In 1942, Ambedkar rejected this agreement, 'state of Myanority' has also expressed Poona Pact's displeasure in this book

 unhone prastaavit kiya ki muslim or gaiyr-muslim bahumat vaale hisson ko alag karne ke liye punjab or bengal kii prantiy simaaon ko phir se taiyaar kiya janaa chahie
 He thought that Muslims could have no objection to retaking the provincial boundaries
 agar unhone kiya, to ve kaaphi "apni maang kii prakruti ko samaj nahin paae"
 Scholar Venkat Dhalipal said that Thoughts on Pakistan "stopped Indian politics for a decade"
 isane muslim lig or bhartiya rashtriya congress ke bich samvaad ke paathyakram ko nirdhaarit kiya, jo bharat ke vibhaajan ke liye rasta tay kar rahaa tha
 Although he was a staunch critic of the divisive communal strategy of Mohammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League, he argued that Hindus and Muslims should be separated and Pakistan should be formed because to lead the same country, due to ethnic nationalism More violence will develop within the country
 unhone hindu or musalamaanon ke sampradayik vibhaajan ke bare main apane vichaar ke paksh me automon samrajya or checkoslovakia ke vighatan jaisi aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa ullekh kiya
 He asked whether sufficient reasons existed for the establishment of Pakistan? And suggested that differences between Hindus and Muslims might have been possible to eradicate even with a less drastic step
 unhone likhaa he ki pakistan ko apane astitv kaa auchity siddh karnaa chaiye
 Communal issues have always been there even in countries like Canada, but even today the British and French live together, so can't Hindus and Muslims also live together
 unhone chetaya ki do desh banane ke samaadhaan kaa vaastavik kriyanvayan atyant kathinaayee bharaa hoga
 With the transfer of large population, there will also be a problem of border dispute
 bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad hone vaali hinsa ko dhyaan main rakh kar kii gai yah bhavishyavaanee sahi thi
 "what Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables?" With this book, Ambedkar sharpened his attacks on both Gandhi and the Congress, accusing them of hypocrisy

 unhone bharat vibhaajan kaa to paksh liya par muslimo main vyaapt bal vivaah kii pratha or mahilaon ke saath hone vaale durvyavhaar kii ghor ninda kii
 They said, bahuvivaah or rakhel rakhane ke dushprinaam shabdon main vyakt nahin kiye ja sakate jo vishesh rup se ek muslim mahila ke dukh ke strot hai
 Take the caste system itself, everyone says that Islam should be free from slavery and caste, while slavery exists and got support from Islam and Islamic countries
 jabaki quran main nihit gulaamon ke nyaay or maanviya upachaar ke bare main paigambar dwaara kiye gaye nuskhe prashansaneey hai, islam main aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo is abhishaap ke unmoolan kaa samarthan karata ho
 Even if slavery ends, caste system will remain among the Muslims

 unhone aage likhaa ki bhartiya musalmaan apane samaaj kaa sudhaar karne main vifal rahe hai jabaki iske vipareet turki jaise deshon ne apane aapako bahut badal liya he
 Both Hindu and Muslim groups suffering from "communalism" have ignored the demand for social justice
 10-12 saal hindu dharm ke antargat rahete hue babasahab ambedkar ne hindu dharm tathaa hindu samaaj ko sudhaarney, samta tathaa sammaan praapt karne ke liye tamaam praytn kiye, parantu savarna hinduon kaa hryday parivartan na hua
 On the contrary, he was condemned and even called the destroyer of Hindu religion
 useke baad unhone kaha tha kii, “hamane hindu samaaj main samanta kaa str praapt karne ke liye har tarah ke praytn or satyagrah kiye, parantu sab nirarthak siddh hue
 There is no place for equality in Hindu society
 ” hindu samaaj kaa yah kahana tha ki “manushya dharm ke liye hai” jabaki ambedkar kaa maananaa tha ki "dharm manushya ke liye hai
 "ambedkar said that such a religion has no meaning in which humanity has no value whatsoever
 jo apane hi dharm ke anuyaayion ko dharm shiksha praapt nahin karne detaa, naukari karne main baadha pahunchaata he, baat-baat par apamaanit karata he or yahan tak ki pani tak nahin milane detaa aise dharm main rahane kaa koi matlab nahin
 Ambedkar did not declare any renunciation of Hinduism for any kind of enmity and destruction of Hinduism, but he decided it with some fundamental principles which were not in sync with Hinduism
 13 oktober 1935 ko nasik ke nikat yevala main ek sammelan main bolte hue ambedkar ne dharm parivartan karne kii ghoshnaa kii, "although i am born as an untouchable Hindu, i will not die as a Hindu at all!" unhone apane anuyaayiyon se bhi hindu dharm chhod koi or dharm apnaane kaa aahvaan kiya

 is dharm-parivartan kii ghoshnaa ke baad hyderabad ke islam dharm ke nizaam se lekar kai isai mishnariyon ne unhen karodon rupee kaa pralobhan bhi diya par unhonen sabhi ko thukraa diya
 Of course, he also wanted that the economic condition of the Dalit society should improve, but not by being dependent on the money, but by their hard work and organization
 iske alaava ambedkar aise dharm ko chunanaa chaahate the jiskaa kendra manushya or naitikta ho, usamen swatantraaa, samta tathaa bandhutav ho
 In any case, he did not want to adopt a religion which is riddled with apartheid and untouchability, nor did he want to choose a religion which has superstition and hypocrisy
 ambedkar ne dharm parivartan kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad 21 varsh tak ke samay ke bich unhone ne vishwa ke sabhi pramukh dharmon kaa gahan adhyayan kiya

 The black body absorbs radiation in a special and continuous spectrum and is re-emitted when heated
 kyonki koi bhi prakaash parilakshith yaa sancharit nahin hota he or vastu jab thandi hoti he, to kaali dikhaai detii he
 However, a black body emits a temperature dependent light spectrum
 krishnika se nikle is saura vikiran ko krishnika vikiran kaha jaataa he
 The shorter the length of the wave in the spectrum of the black body, the higher the frequency and the higher the frequency is related to the higher temperature
 is prakaar, ek garm vastu kaa rang varnakram ke nile ant ke kareeb hota he or ek thandi vastu kaa rang laal ke kareeb hota he
 At room temperature, the black body emits mostly infrared wavelengths, but when the temperature rises a few hundred degrees Celsius, the black body emits visible wavelengths, which look red, orange, yellow, bright, blue as the temperature rises
 vastu ke safed hone tak vah paryaapt maatra main parabangnee vikiran utsarjit karti he
 The term "krishnika" was introduced in 1860 by Gustav Kirchhoff
 jab iskaa yogic visheshan ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he, to yah shabd aam taur par "krishnika vikiran" yaa " blakebody radiation" ke rup main ek shabd main sanyukt ho jaataa he
 The black body emission provides insight into the solar equilibrium state of a continuous field
 shastreey bhautikee main saura santulan main prayek alag-alag foorier mod main samaan urja honi chahie
 This approach led to a paradox, known as the ultraviolet disaster, and containing an enormous amount of energy in the field of sustainable living
 krishnika saura santulan ke gunon kaa pareekshan kar sakate hai, kyonki ve jo surya kii kirnon dwaara vitarit kiye jane vaale vikiran utsarjit karte hai
 Historically, the concept of quantum mechanics came from studying the laws of the black body
 krishnika kaa vikiran ek khaas taapmaana main krishnika ke saath saura santulan or prakaash vikiran kaa prakaash hota he
 This refers to the thermodynamics equilibrium state of light
 prayogtmak rup se yah krishnika yukt ek kathor-deevaaron vaali guha main sthir sthiti santulan vikiran ke rup main sthapit ho chukaa he
 There are no strongly true black bodies in nature but graphite is a good analogy and a closed box with graphite walls at steady state is a good approximation of the ideal radiation of a black body
 ek guha, jisamen koi krishnika nahin he, vah santulan kii sthiti main krishnika vikiran barkaraar rakhane main sakasham nahin he, yah tathy kirchaaf dwaara prayogtmak rup se paaya gaya he, lekin iskaa bhautik mahatv na to kirchaaf ne samajha or na hi plank ne
 Since light is a oscillating form of a constant electromagnetic field, radiation-studies of the black body reveal how temperatures occur in continuous fields, contradicting classical physics
 kyonki kwantum yantriki ke aagaman se pehle prakaash kii saura sthiti itani bhramit karne vaali thi ki 19 veen sadi ke in tarkon ko kaaphi saavdhaanee se pesh kiya gaya ki prakaash kii ek saura santulan sthiti hoti he
 At fixed temperatures, a substance in t can be seen glowing like an oven
 jis bindu par sabhi thos padaarth ek mand laal chamak paidaa karte hai, us bindu ko draper bindu naam diya gaya
 An oven at 1000 k looks red and at 6000 k it looks white
 jab tak oven kaaphi chamakdaar nahin hota tab tak isse koi antar nahin padataa he ki bhatthi kaa nirmaan kaise kiya gaya he, prakaash kaa rang keval taapmaana par nirbhar karata he
 Since color is a directly visible measure of wavelength, this means that light at different temperatures distributes different energies between different wavelengths
 tii taapmaana par λ tarangadairghy main prati unit volum i urja kii maatra ko krishnika ghumaav kii avasthaa kaha jaataa he
 Detailed experiments have shown that the state of rotation of the black body depends only on the temperature and not on the emitted material
 This suggests that light, like any other object, actually comes from solar equilibrium and thus the concept of light at t temperature is understandable
 samaan taapmaana par do chijen santulan main rah sakati hai, jaise tii taapmaana par prakaash ke badal se ghira padaarth tii taapmaana par ausat rup se badal main utana prakaash vikirit kar saktaa he, jitna vah sokh le, yah privost ke vinimay siddhant par aadhaarit he, jo vikaranshil santulan ko sandarbhit karata he
 The principle of broad equilibrium states that there is no peculiar correlation between the process of emission and absorption, that the process of emission is not affected by absorption but only by the solar state of the emitting material
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki tii taapmaana par padaarth dwaara utsarjit kul prakaash, chaahe vah krishna padaarth ho yaa nahi, hameshaa us kul prakaash ke baraabar hota he, jise padaarth avashoshit karata he, jo tii taapmaana par prakaash se ghira ho
 The amount of light absorbed for a black body is as much as it falls on the surface
 kisi bhi tarangadairghy λ ke prati ikai samay main avashoshit prakaash urja anivaary rup se krishnika ke karv ke anupaat main hoti he
 This means that the rotation of the black body is as much as the light energy emitted by the black body, which justifies its name
 yah saura vikiran kaa kirchof niyam he: krishnika kaa utsarjan ghumaav prakaash kii saura visheshta he, jo keval guha kii deevaaron kewapamanaper hi nirbhar karata he, basharte yah sthiti honi aavashyak he ki guha main kuch puri tarah se kaali saamagree ho or yah vikaranshil santulan main ho
 Absorption is modified when the black body is so small that its size can be compared to the wavelength of light, because a small object cannot be an efficient absorber of light of long wavelength, but the principle of rigorous equality of emission and absorption Are always justified
 prayogshaala main, krishnika ke vikiran kii maatra kaa anumaan ek badi guha ke praveshdwar par ek chote chhed, ekahohalerum, jisamen krishnika hota he or jise santulan tak pahunchaaya jaataa he or barkaraar rakhaa jaataa he, ke jariye lagaaya jaataa he
 
 The light entering the hole has to be reflected several times on the walls of the cavity before being released, in which process it becomes almost certain to be absorbed
 yah pravesh kar rahe vikiran ke tarangadairghy se matlab rakhe bina bhi ho saktaa he 
 tab yah chhed ek saidhantik krishnika ke kareebi sanniktan ke rup main hoga or yadi guha ko garm kiya jaye to chhed ke vikiran kaa varnakram satat hoga, haalanki yah bhi puri sunishchit karnaa hoga ki guha main lagbhag puri tarah se kaali kuch saamagree rakhi gai ho or yah bhi ki santulan kaayam kiya gaya he or ise barkaraar rakhaa gaya he, lekin in praavdhaanon ke saath, yah aage guha kii anya samagriyon par ashrith nahin rahati he
 
 19 veen sadi ke uttararddh ke dauraan saidhantik bhautikee main krishnika ke ghumaav kii gananaa ek pramukh chunauti thi
 The problem was finally solved in 1901 by Max Planck's Planck law of black-body radiation
 thermodynemics or electromangnetismo se talmail rakhte hue unhone vaayen ke vikiran niyam main badlaav kiye or ek santoshjanak tareeke se prayogtmak data ke upyukt ek ganitiya sutara paaya
 To get a physical explanation of his formula, Planck then assumed that the energy of oscillation in the cavity was balanced
 oinstin ne is vichaar ko aage badhaayaa or 1905 main hi photo electric prabhaav kii vyakhya karne ke liye prastaavit vidyut chumbakeey vikiran ke parimanikaran kaa prastaav diya
 These theoretical advances eventually resulted in the elimination of classical electromagnetism by quantum electrodynamics
 aaj, in quanta ko photonkaha jaataa hai or sochaa ja saktaa he ki krishnika kii guha main photons kii gas ho sakati hai
 Furthermore, it guided the development of quantum probability distributions, called fermi-direc statics and bose-einstein statics, and each of these particles applied to different classes, which were used in quantum mechanics instead of classical distributions
 
 pheramion or boson bhi dekhen 
 The wavelength at which radiation is strongest is called the Vaughan displacement law and the overall power emitted per unit area is given by the Stefan Boltzmann law
 atah jaise-jaise taapmaana badhata he, chamak kaa rang laal se pile or phir safed se nile main parivartit hota he
 Even as the peak wavelength enters the ultraviolet, enough radiation continues to be emitted at the blue wavelength, causing the substance to appear blue
 yah kabhi bhi adrishy nahin hoga- vastav main, drishy prakaash kaa vikiran taapmaana ke saath ek gati se badhata rahata he
 Brightness or supervised intensity is not a function of direction
 isliye ek krishnika ek paripurna lambartian radiator hota he
 Real objects never behave like absolute ideal dark matter, and instead radiation emitted at a fixed frequency is a fraction of the ideal emission possible
 ek saamagree kaa utsarjan bataata he ki ek vaastavik padaarth ek krishnika kii tulana main kitni acchhee tarah urja kaa vikiran karata he
 This {0} emission { / 0} depends on many factors, such as temperature, direction of emission, and wavelength
 haalanki, ejineering main yah maan vishisht he ki ek sataha kaa varnakrameey utsarjan or avasorana tarangadairghy par nirbhar nahin karte hai, isliye utsarjan ek nirantar prakriya he
 This is known as gray body prediction

 This is closer to the Kircharf law: emission is equal to absorption, so an object that does not absorb all the light falling will emit less radiation than an ideal black body
 khagol vigyaan main taron jaise pindon ko aksar krishnika mana jaataa he, haalanki yah ek kamjor sanniktan he
 a nearly complete black-body radiation spectrum is represented by cosmic microwave background radiation
 vikiran kaa failaav kaale chhed dwaara utsarjit ek kaalpanik krishnika vikiran he
 Although Planck's formula predicts that a black body will radiate energy at all frequencies, this formula will only apply if multiple photons are being measured
 udhaaharan ke liye, kamare ke taapmaana par ek vargametre ke sataha kshetra main ek krishnika prayek 41 second par ek photone kii ausat dar par drishy range par ek photone utsarjit karegaa, iskaa matlab yah hua ki zyaadaatar vyaavhaarik prayojanon main ek aisa krishnika drishy paraas main utsarjan nahin karegaa
 Although a black body is a theoretical object, the general application of a source to infrared radiation is defined as a black body when the object reaches an emission of 1

 If we know the size of the spectrum at one temperature, then we can calculate the size at another temperature
 vaayen ke visthaapan niyam kaa ek parinaam yah he ki ek tarangadairghy, jis par krishnika dwaara utpaadit vikiran kii tivrata adhiktam hoti he, λ m a x { \ displaystyle \ lambda _{ \ mathrm {max} }}, yah keval taapmaana kaa kaary he Where the constant B, known as the displacement continuum of the vane, equals 2

 dhyaan rahe ki chotii kii tivrata ko prati unit tarangadairghy yaa prati unit aavriti kii tivrata ke sandarbh main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 The above expression for peak wavelength represents the intensity per unit wavelength; Whereas the above section of Planck's law is known in terms of frequency per unit
 aavriti, jis par prati ikai urja aavriti adhiktam hoti he use This rule states that the energy emitted per unit surface area of a black body is directly proportional to one-fourth the energy of its absolute temperature

 The temperature of a planet depends on some factors: aantarik grahon ke liye, ghatana or utsarjit vikiran kaa taapmaana par sabase zyada mahatvapurn prabhaav padataa he
 This derivation is mainly related to it
 stephen-boltzman niyam surya dwaara utsarjit kul urja detaa he
 where surya sabhi dishaao main samaan rup se urja utsarjit karata he
 Because of this, the Earth is warmed by only a small fraction of it
 surya kii jo urja prithvi par padati he vah he: so ucch taapmaana ke kaaran, suraj baari maatra main parabangnee or drishy aavriti range par utsarjan karata he
 In this frequency range, the Earth reflects a fraction of this energy 1- α { \ displaystyle \ alpha}, where α { \ displaystyle \ alpha} is the Earth's albedo and reflection in the uv-vis range
 duusare shabdon main, prithvi surya ke prakaash kaa ek ansh 1 − α { \ displaystyle 1- \ alpha } avashoshit karti he or baaki ko paravartit kar detii he
 The energy absorbed by the Earth and its atmosphere is expressed as: yahaan tak ki prithvi ek golakaar kshetra π r 2 { \ displaystyle \ pi R^{2}} ke rup main hi avashoshit karti he, yah kshetra kii sabhi dishaao main samaan rup se utsarjan karti he
 If the Earth were a perfect black body, it would emit according to the Stephan – Boltzmann method
 jahaan T_{E} prithvi kaa taapmaana hota he
 The Earth, since it has a much lower temperature than the Sun, emits only the infrared part of most of the spectrum
 is aavriti range main, yah us vikiran ko utsarjit ε ̄ { \ displaystyle { \ overline { \ epsilon }}} karti he, jo ek krishnika dwaara ε ̄ { \ displaystyle { \ overline { \ epsilon }}} iaar range main utsarjit ausat utsarjaktaa he
 So the energy emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere is as follows: yah maanate hue ki prithvi ushn santulan main he, avashoshit urja avashya hi utsarjit urja ke baraabar honi aavashyak he : Substituting the power of solar and earth in equations 1-6 and in simple form it can be called: duusare shabdon main, manyataon ke mutabik, prithvi kaa taapmaana keval surya, surya kii trigya, prithvi or surya ke bich duuri, albido or prithvi ke iaar utsarjan ke taapmaana par hi nirbhar karata he
 If we substitute the measured values for the Sun and Earth: agar ham unity kaa ausat utsarjan tay karen, ham gananaa kar sakate hai ki prithvi kaa "prabhavi taapmaana" aisa hoga : This is what the Earth would be if it radiated into a perfect black body in the infrared, ignoring the greenhouse effect and in the event of an irreversible albedo

 When this effect is included, it is found that the black body at temperature t is decreasing with the v velocity, which seems to have the same spectrum as the black body stationary at t temperature
 jaise In a case in which the source is moving directly towards or away from the observer, it is reduced yahan v >0 sanket karata he ki yah kam ho rahaa strot he or v <0 nikat aa rahe strot kii ore sanket karata he
 This is an important influence in astronomy, where the velocity of stars and galaxies can reach significant degrees of c

 It was used by both the Houses of Parliament and the Royal Courts
 kyonki vastav main yah ek shahi grih tha, isliye yahaan par donon sadanon ke kisi anya kaary ke liye koi kaksh nahin banaaya gaya tha
 The main festivals of the state were celebrated in painted rooms
 house of lords kii baithak vastav main rani ke kaksh main hoti thi
 This elegant hall was located at the south end of the building which was built in the medieval period
 1801 main ucch sadan bade safed kaksh main sthanantarit ho gaya
 It used to be in the Court of Request before

 At the same time there was a treaty with Ireland

 The House of Commons had no chamber of its own, its meetings were sometimes held in the Chapter House of Westminster Abbey
 kamans ne pales main stephen chapel ke rup main apane liye ek sthai jagah bana lee
 Stephen's Chapel was the former chapel of the Royal Palace during the reign of Edward VI
 1547 main yah imaarat kamans ke istemaal ke liye uplabdh ho gayi
 St Stephen's College had to be disbanded for this
 agali teen shatabdiyon main stifan ke chapel main kai badlaav kiye gayi, taaki nichle sadan kii suvidha barkaraar rahe
 Then immediately, his form of medievalism was completely destroyed
 kyonki sansad ko apane simit jagah me kaary karne main pareshaani ho rahi thi isliye pales of westominster main 18 veen shatabdi ke baad se kai prakaar ke parivartan kiye gayi
 The talk of building an entirely new palace was ignored, instead new buildings were added to it
 a new western main gate was built between 1755 and 1770
 yah darwaja saint margaret street kii ore khulata tha
 It was built in the Padalian style
 ab saamudayik kaksh evam sangrakshan ke liye kaaphi jagah ho gayi thi
 In 1795 a new official residence was built for the Speaker of the House of Commons
 yah saint stephen chapel ke saath sata hua tha
 Between 1799 and 1801 the new Gothic craftsman James Wyatt started his work in both the Houses, the House of Lords and the House of Commons
 1824 or 1827 ke bich mahal kii puri imaarat ko ek baar phir se banaaya gaya
 And this time Sir John Son did it
 madhya kaaleen house of laders kaa chembar jo ki 1650 main gan powder plot ke fail hone par nishaanaa bana tha
 He was devastated to carry out this renovation work
 taaki is jagah ke dakshin sire par ek nayaa shahi galiyara or bhavy pravesh dwaar banaaya ja sake
 The tasks that Son did in the palace included the new facility of the library for both the houses of Parliament and the new law room for the king's law bench and the high court
 son dwaara kii nayi kalatmak shilpkaaree ko lekar kai virodhabhas bhi uthne shuru ho gayi
 Those who supported the Gothic art of the original building became opposed to it
 16 oktober 1834 ko pales main aag lag gai jab lathi bhandar main rakhe aag ke stove ke atyadhik tap jane ke kaaran house of laders ke kaksh ne aag pakad lee
 iske parinaam swaroop sansad ke dono sadan nasht ho gayi or aas paas kii anya imaaraten bhi nahin bachiin
 aag bachaav dal kii sartakta ke kaaran or hawa kii disha ke anukool hone kii vajah se westominster haul batch gaya
 The Jewel Tower, the Under Craft Chapel, the Cloisters and the Chapter House of St
 Stephen's are the other parts of the palace that survived the disaster
 aag lagane ke turant baad hi raja wiliam IV ne apana buckingham pales sansad ko dene kii peshkash kii, jo banakar lagbhag taiyaar ho chukaa tha
 The reason behind this was also that he did not like her as his place of residence
 is imaarat ko sansad ke kaary ke liye upyukt nahin paaya gaya
 Therefore the offer was rejected
 charing cars or james park par bhi vichaar nahin ban paaya
 Historical and political connections to Wesminster proved powerful for the transfer
 jabaki vahaan kai kamiyaan thim
 Now priority was being given that Parliament should get its place as soon as possible
 isliye house of lard tathaa house of kamans ke liye jaldi main chitrakala vaale kaksh or safed kaksh ko taiyaar kiya gaya
 The direction for this was done by the remaining craftsman of the Board of Works, Sir Robert Smirk
 farvari 1835 sadan chalaane ke liye kaksh taiyaar karne kaa kaam jaldi jaldi kiya gaya
 a royal organization appointed to study the new structure of the palace, its proposed style was also debated among the people
 ab yah nai uttam padyati jo ki sanyukt rajya ke fedral capital or white house jaisi thi, us samay kaaphi prachlit hui
 yah style pehle son dwaara puraane mahal ke kuch hisse main bhi istemaal kii ja chuki thi
 It had signs of revolution and republic in the new format
 jabaki gothic sanrachana main sangrakshan ke mulya ke mulya chhipe the
 In 1835, this commission had announced that the format of this building would be either Gothic or Elizabethan
 This royal commission asked all architects to plan with this view
 1836 main 97 paraspar virdohi yojanayen padhane ke baad shahi ayog ne gothic style kaa mahal banane ke liye bairi kii yojana ko chunaa
 isaki neenv to 1840 main hi daal di gai thi
 Lord's Room was completed in 1847 and Commons' Room in 1852
 Although 1860 employees were engaged for this work, this work could not be completed for a decade
 bairi jisaki apni shilpakala gothic kam or panrparik zyada he
 He built this new palace on the basis of new rules of balance
 He relied on Augustus Pugin for interior decoration and grand construction
 Which included wall decoration, carving work, tile work, furniture etc
 duusare vishwa yuddh ke dauraan jab germany ne landan par bambaari kii thi tab alag alag avasar par chaudaa baar pales of westominster bhi is bambaari kaa shikaar hua tha
 On 26 September 1940, a bomb was dropped in the old palace
 is bambaari main saint stifan porch kii dakshini diwaar nasht ho gayi thi or saath hi iskaa pashchimi mukhadwar bhi nasht ho gaya tha
 The statue of The Loin Richard had also risen somewhat from its place due to this powerful explosion and the sword raised above it fell
 is pratimaa ko loktantr ke pratik ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 It is said that "in the event of an attack, even if you bow down a little, it will not break"
 a second bomb that fell on 8 December destroyed many monasteries
 10 / 11 may 1941 ko sabase zyada khatarnaak hamalaa hua tha, tab pales ko kam se kam 12 jatke lage the or teen logon kii mrityu ho gai thi
 a fiery bomb hit the chamber of the House of Commons and set fire to it
 The second bomb rocked the roof of Westminster Hall
 The fire rescue team could not save both and it was decided that at least work should be done to keep Andal Hall safe
 These people were successful in this task
 lekin comons kaksh puri tarah se nasht ho chukaa tha or sadsy lobby bhi nahin bachi thi
 a bomb also fell into the lord's chamber, but went off without a break on the ground
 yaa to koi chota bam upar clock tower se takaraayaa tha yaa phir koi vimaan bhedi chat ke chajje par gira tha
 Due to which the roof was severely damaged
 ghadi kaa sheesha puri tarah se nasht ho chukaa tha
 But its hands and bell were still working and even now this big watch was telling the right time
 kamans chembar ke nasht hone ke baad, lard ne swayan kaa vaad vivaad kaksh kamans ke istemaal ke liye de diya 
 or lard ke swayan ke istemaal ke liye quins robing room ko kuch samay apane prayog main laane ke liye lard ne rakh liya
 After the war the Commons Room was remodeled under the direction of the craftsman Sir Giles Gilbert Scott
 is baar yah bahut hi saadhaaran puraane kaksh kii style main banaaya gaya
 This work ended in 1950
 ab donon sadanon ko apana apana kaksh mil gaya
 Now the need for office space began to increase and the Parliament acquired some space in the nearby Norman Shaw building in 1975

 With this increase, there is space for all mps to create their own offices

 gyarahavi shatabdi main bana westominster haul jo 1834 kii aagjanee ko jhel chukaa he
 This hall was designed by Barry
 pugin is kaam ke nattejey se khush nahin the
 He was mainly dissatisfied with the design plan devised by Barry
 unhonen iske liye ye tippanee bhi kii thi ki sabhi gracian, sar, yah paaramparik imaarat par tuder style kaa vivaran he"
 The stonework done on this building was actually Anston
 yah ek baaluu ke rang kaa magangian limestone he
 Whose mine is in Anston village in South Yorkshire
 yah pathar halaki pradooshan or duusare istemaal ho rahe kam gunvattta vaale pattharon ke kaaran jaldi hi kharaab hone laga
 yadhyapi yah sab kharabiyaan jald se jald 1849 tak thik kar lee gayi thim or iske baad 19 veen shatabdi main kuch nahin kiya gaya tha
 During 1900, one thing was very clear that some work of stone carving would have to be changed now
 
 The project was started in 1930, but due to the Second World War, its work stopped and it was finished in 1950 itself
 1960 tak pradooshan ab phir se prabhavi hone laga
 1981 main towers or bahari unnayan ke pattharon ke sangrakshan kii ek yojana shuru hui

 westominster pales me teen mukhya stambh hai
 The largest and tallest of these is the 98
5-meter Victoria Tower
 jisamen ki pales kaa dakshini pashchimi konaa aata he
 In honor of the rule of the then ruler William 4, this tower was kept in the original design of Barry itself
 isko bairi ne sabase zyada yaadgaar banane kii koshish kii thi
 This sculpture, which oversees the legislative fort, is called the Great Square Tower and is used as the royal entrance to the Palace and also serves as a fire watch for the book collection of Parliament
 is victoria tower ko kai baar punah banaaya gaya or isaki oonchai bahut teji se badi
 1858 main puraa banane tak yah sansar kii sabase badi dharmanirpeksh imaarat ban gaya tha
 At the bottom of the tower is the ruling entrance
 is pales main pravesh karne ke liye or parliament ko kholane ke liye raja dwaara istemaal kiya jaataa he
 It is decorated with 15
2-meter-high vaulted path artefacts, including statues of St
 George, Andrew and Paterik as well as Queen Victoria
 is victoria tower ke mukhya hisse main sansadeey lekhaagaar ke tees lakh dastavej hai
 8
8 km It contains all the key manuscripts of the Parliament Act from 1497 to the present and other major manuscripts such as original copies of the Bill of Rights and copies of King Charles's Death Warrant are also present here
 sabase upar louhe se bani pyramid numa chat 22

 jhandaa diwas ke avasar par tathaa jis din sansad ke kisi bhi ek sadan kii sabha hoti thi, us din sabase upar jaakar sangheey jhande ko fahraaya jaataa he
 At the southern end of this palace is a very famous tower known as the Clock Tower, it is also known as Big Ben
 yah 96
3 meter ke victoria tower se thodaa hi chota he lekin bahut hi patala he
 It has a large clock in Westminster
 jise ki edward jon dent ne banaaya tha or iskaa dizin shaukia horologist edmund backet denisan ne taiyaar kiya tha
 In a moment, its bells ring completely, the specialty of this big watch is that its timing is absolutely accurate, which the 19th century watchmakers considered difficult
 or 1859 se jab se yah astitv main ai he is par bharosa kaayam he
 Its time is measured in diameter by four dials 7 meters, which are made of milky colored glass and at night it shines from behind
 iskaa ghante vaala haath 2
7 meter lanbaa he or minute vaala haath 4
3 meter chota he
 Five bells hang in the clock on the top of the house
 chaar chaturthaansh ghantiyaan westominster ke ghantanad ko har ghante ke har chauthe bhaag main bajaati rahati hai
 The biggest bell when the bell rings is called the Great Bell of Westminster in official language
 saamanyata ise bigaben bhi kehete hai
 Which is the name given to uncertain origins, this name started to be used for the tower over time
 The first bell, which was given this name, broke during testing and it was then re-molded
 There is a rift in the vine that is in front of us today
 jiske kaaran isaki dhwani bhi kuch alag ho gayi he
 If seen, its weight is 13
8 tonnes, the third largest clock in Britain
 The lantern that is placed at the top of the clock tower is the Ayrton light, it only burns when the assembly of the rough house of Parliament continues even after dark
 yah rani victoria ke anurodh par 1885 main lagaai gai thi taaki ve buckingham pales se bhi yah dekh saken ki sabhi sadsy kaam par hai yaa nahin
 It was named after the first commissioner of work Ekton Smy Ayrton
 mahal ke tino stambhon par) main sabase chota stambh octagonal central tower imaarat ke bilkul madhya main he
 It is just above the central lobby
 yah dow david bosewell ke jor dene par joda gaya tha
 He was in charge of ventilation of the new Parliament House
 inaki yojana ke anusaari hi pales ke madhya main ek badi chimney banaai gai thi
 For which they had said that the polluted and hot air generated by the fire burning from all four sides of the palace will come out through this chimney
 In order to replace the tower, it was emphasized to Barry that he planned the high roof of the lobby
 un chhaton ko nicha hi rakhaa jaye
 or isaki khidakiyon kii oochai ko bhi kam kiya jaye
 halaki yah stambh bhi mahal kii bahari sanrachana ke liye ek acha mauka sabit hua
 Barry had conceived the design of a tower for this so that these large pillars could be balanced
 Eventually, the central tower completely failed in its purpose
 But this work was worth noting because it was the first time mechanical services were directly impacting the craft
 shikhar choote kangure jo khidakiyon ke baade ke bich tathaa mahal ke saamne se uthte hue upar kii ore ja rahe hai, yah aakash ke kshitij se lagati imaarat ko sajiv banaate hai
 Like the central tower, it is also connected for some practical reasons, it also makes way for the movement of light
 saanchaa:sectionvestaminstara kii kuch or visheshtaayen bhi hai, ve bhi tower hi kehalaati hai
 The St
 Stephen Tower is located at the western main entrance to the Palace
 westominster haul or puraane pales yard ke bich parliament house ke liye public antras he, ise saint stephens antras kehete hai
 The towering building on the southern and northern tip of the river mouth is called the Speakers Tower and the Chancellors Tower
 At the time of the reconstruction of the palace, the Speaker and Lord High Chancellor of the House of the Commons were followed by the officers who operated both houses
 spikar tower main spikar house or kamans ke spikar kaa aadhikarik sadan aata he
 There are many small gardens around the Palace of Westminster
