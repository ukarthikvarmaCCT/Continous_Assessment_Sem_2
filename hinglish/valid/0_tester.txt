 Many narratives of this story have been written, but the most famous is the story of Baba Waris Shah

 Heer was a very beautiful woman born in a wealthy family of Sial sub-castes of Jats in Jhang city of Punjab
 dhido ranjha chanaab nadi ke kinare takht hazaaraa naamak gaanv ke ek ranjha upjati vaale jat parivaar ke chaar ladakon main sabase chota bhai tha
 He was the beloved son of his father, so where his brother used to work in the fields, Ranjha was playing the flute, living the life of comfort
 uski bhabhiyon ne use khaanaa dene se inkaar kar diya or vah ghar chhodkar nikal padaa or chalate-chalate hir ke gaanv pahunch gaya
 He fell in love with Heer there
 hir ne use apane pita kii gaay-bhaisen charaane kaa kaam diya
 Hearing Ranjhe's flute, she became enchanted and fell in love with him
 vah ek-duusare se chup-chup kar milane lage
 One day he is seen by Heer's jealous uncle, Kaido, and his father and mother forcefully marry Heer to a man named Saida Kheda
 raanjhe kaa dil tut jaataa he or vah jog lene ke liye baba gorakhnath ke prasiddh dere, tilla jogiyaan, chalaa jaataa he

 hir-raanjha donon hir ke gaanv aa jate hai jahaan hir ke maan-pita unhen shaadi karne kii ijazat de dete hai lekin hir kaa chachaa kaido unhen kush dekhakar jalataa he
 On the wedding day, Kaido adds poison to Heer's dinner
 yah khabar sunakar ranjha use bachane dauda aata he lekin bahut der ho chuki hoti he
 Ranjha, after suffering more than he can tolerate, consumes the same poisonous laddu and succumbs to Heer's side
 unhen hir ke shahar, jhang, main dafanaaya jaataa he or har taraf se log unke mazaar par aakar unhen yaad karte hai
 The Damodar poet, lived in the reign of Akbar and describes himself as a friend of Heer's father Chuchak and says that this is all my eyes saw

 Major Dhyanchand was born on 29 August 1905 in Allahabad

 We lost it by one goal instead of four

 a valence or polymer is an organic compound with a very high molecular volume
 yah saral anuon jinhen monomer kaha jaataa; ke bahut adhik ikaiyon ke polimerigeshan ke falswaroop banataa he
 Many polymers are attached to the same type of recurring structural units, ie, monomer connective bonds
 celulos, lakdi, resham, twachaa, rabar aadi prakritik polimar hai, ye khuli avasthaa main prakruti main paae jate hai tathaa inhen paudhon or jeevadhariyon se praapt kiya jaataa he
 Other examples with its chemical names are polyethylene, teflan, poly vinyl chloride, the major polymers
 kritrim yaa synthetic polimar maanav nirmit hote hai
 These can be produced in factories
 plastic, pipon, botalon, baltiyon aadi ke nirmaan main prayukt hone vaali polithin synthetic polimar he
 Synthetic polymer is also a plastic cover mounted on electrical cables, cables
 fibre, sitacovar, majboot pipe evam botalon ke nirmaan main prayukt hone vaali propylain bhi synthetic polimar he
 Valve seals, filter cloths, gas kits etc
 are made from Teflon
 synthetic rabar bhi polimar he jisase motargadiyon ke tair banaae jate hai
 According to Holland scientists, a fluid called a dope in the spider forms a protein-rich polymer as soon as it comes out of its body
 polimar shabd kaa pratham prayog jones berjeeliyas ne 1833 main kiya tha
 In 1907 Leo Backland created the first synthetic polymer, by the process of phenol and formaldehyde
 unhone ise bakelite naam diya
 In 1922 Hermann Stoddinger was awarded the Nobel Prize for formulating the new theory of polymer
 isse pehle yah mana jaataa tha ki ye chote anuon kaa cluster he, jinhen colides kehete the, jiskaa anvik bhaar gyaat nahin tha
 But this theory states that polymers are bound by covalent bonds in a chain
 polimar shabd poli or meros se milakar bana he
 Polymers formed from monomer units of the same type are called homopolymers
 jaise polistyrine kaa ekmaatr monomer styrine hi he
 Polymers formed from different types of monomer units are called copolymers
 jaise ithyle-vinil-acitate bhinn prakaar ke monomaron se banataa he
 On the basis of physical and chemical properties, they can be divided into two classes: bahulak padaarthon ke namakaran kii kai paddatiyaan hai
 Polymers used in many common usage items are called by their common nicknames
 ye naam kisi vyakti yaa aitihaasik ghatana vishesh par aadhaarit ho sakate hai, bajaay koi maanak tareeke ke
 The American Chemical Society and IUPAC have described their naming methods, which are very similar, but not identical
 bhinn namakaran paddatiyon ke bich antar ko neeche dikhaaya gaya he: In both standardized methods, attempts have been made to denote the names of monomers forming them in polymer names, rather than repeating sub-unit names
 udhaahrantah saadhaaran alkin, ithin se banane vaale bahulak ko polithine yaa poli-ithaylin kehete hai, jabaki iske dwibandh swaroop naam ke in ansh kaa astitv khatm ho chukaa he, yani dwibandh hat chukaa he
 Picture: Ethene polymerization hindi
png polimar ke adhyayan ko bahulak vigyaan yaa polimar takanic kehete hai
 Its courses are available in many colleges and universities
 bahut se bahulak biodegradable nahin hote, jaise polithine
 That is why its use is becoming prohibited
 iske liye bahut se vikalp khoje ja rahe hai
 As such corn corn polymer has also been extracted
 yah purnataya biodigradable hoga jiske kaaran isse banane vaala polithine jameen main gaad die jane ke sirf das din main compost main badal jaataa he or kooday ke dher main rahane par bhi yah polithine 90 din kii avadhi main compost ban jaataa he
 Also, there is no big difference in the price of corn polymer from the price of polyethylene
 nakli noton kii samasya se nipatane ke liye pehali baar polimar note australia main pesh kiye gaye the
 Apart from Australia, polymer notes are also in circulation in New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Romania, Bermuda, Brunei and Vietnam
 bhartiya reserve bank bhi polimar ke note nikaalane kii yojana bana rahaa he
 Such notes will not melt in water, nor is there a fear of turning and breaking
 carbon ke rasinic yogicon ko carbonic yogic kehete hai
 Their number in nature is more than 1 million
 jivan paddati main carbonic yogicon kii bahut hi mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 These contain carbon as well as hydrogen
 aitihaasik tathaa paramparaagat kaarnon se kuch carbon ke yogakon ko carbonic yogicon kii shrenee main nahin rakhaa jaataa he
 These mainly include carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide
 sabhi jaev anu jaise carbohydrate, amino amla, protein, arene tathaa diene carbonic yogic hi hai
 Compounds of carbon and hydrogen are called hydrocarbons
 methen sabase chote anusutra kaa hydrocarbon he
 Ethane, propane, etc
 are followed by which one carbon is added respectively
 hydrocarbon teen shreniyon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai: ethane shrenee, ethilin shrenee or asitilin shrenee
 Ethane-grade hydrocarbons are saturated, ie, the amount of hydrogen in them cannot be increased further
 ethilin main do carbonon ke bich main ek dwibandh he, asitilin main trigun bandha vaale yogic asthaayee hai
 It can easily get oxidised and halogenated
 hydrocarbonon ke bahut se vyutpann taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai, jinke vividh upyog hai
 Such derivatives are chloride, bromide, iodide, alcohol, sodium alkoxide, amine, mercaptan, nitrate, nitrite, nitrite, hydrogen phosphate, and hydrogen sulfate
 asatrupt hydrocarbon adhik sakriy hota he or anek abhikaarakon se sanyukt ha saralata se vyutpann banaata he
 Many such derivatives have proved to be of great importance from an industrial point of view
 inase anek bahumoolya vilaayak, plastic, kriminashak oshadhiyaan aadi praapt hui hai
 The oxidation of hydrocarbons gives alcohol ether, ketones, aldehydes, fatty acids, esters, etc
 alcodaul praathmik, dwitiyak or tritiyak ho sakate hai
 Their ester fluids are aromatic
 anek sugandhit dravya inase taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai
 Similarly, polymers can also be used in various experiments
