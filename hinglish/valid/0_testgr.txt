 vigyaan kii anya shakhayein yaa to sidhe hi bhautik par aadhaarit hai, athwa inke tathyon ko iske mul siddhanton se sambhddha karne kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 The importance of physics is also more because being the birthplace of engineering and crafts science, it is the basic motivator of all social and economic development of this era
 bahut pehle isko darshan shaastra kaa ang maanakar natural philosophy yaa prakritik darshanashastra kehete the, kintu 1870 isvi ke lagbhag isko vartmaan naam bhautikee yaa physics dwaara sambodhit karne lage
 Gradually this science kept progressing and at this time seeing the rapid pace of its development, even the leading physicists are surprised

 is prakaar urja sangrakshan or dravyaman sangrakshan donon siddhanton kaa samanvay ho jaataa he or is siddhant ke dwaara bhautikee or rasayan ek duusare se sambhddha ho jate hai
 Physics can be broadly divided into two parts
 1900 isvi se purv jo bhautik gyaan arjeet kiya gaya tha or tatsambandhi jo niyam tathaa siddhant pratipaadit kiye gaye the, unka samavesh chirsmmat bhautikee main kiya gaya
 The inspirations of the ideology of that time were Galileo and Newton
 chirsmmat bhautikee ko mukhyat: yantriki, dhvaniki, ooshmaa, vidyutchumbakatv or prakaashiki main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 These branches are the cornerstone of engineering and craft science and elementary education in physics is started from them only
 1900 isvi ke pashchaat anek krantikari tathy gyaat hue, jinako chirasmmati bhautikee ke dhaanche main baithaana kathin he
 The branch of physics that originated in studying these new facts and solving their clues is called modern physics
 aadhunik bhautikee kaa dravyasanrachana se sidhaa sambandh he
 Atomic elements, nuclei and basic particles are their main subjects
 bhautikee kii is naveen shakha ne vaigyanik vichaardhaara ko naveen or krantikari mode diya he tathaa isse samaajik vigyaan or darshanashastra bhi mahatvapurn rup se prabhavit hue hai
 'currently solid state physics is known as modern physics where we reads about construction and energy of material
 There are some other branches but Electronics is the latest

 neeche di gayin sarvasamikaaye trivimiya yuklidia avkaash ke sadishon se sambandhit hai inamen se kuch adhik vima vaale sadishon ke liye bhi satya hai
 For example, the vector product of two vectors is not available for all dimensions
 sadish a kaa pariman, is sadish ke teen paraspar lambavat dishaao main component ke virgon ke yoga ke vargamul ke baraabar hota he
 This magnitude can also be expressed in the following way using scalar product
 Here the notation denotes the dot product of vectors a and B
 The vector product and the scalar product of two vectors define the angle between them, say θ: To satisfy the right-hand rule, for positive θ, vector b is counter-clockwise from A, and for negative θ it is clockwise
 Here the notation a × b denotes the vector cross product of vectors a and B
 The Pythagorean trigonometric identity then provides: If a vector a = makes angles α, β, γ with an orthogonal set of x-, y- and z-axes, then: and analogously for angles β, γ
 Consequently: with i ^ , j ^ , k ^ { \ displaystyle { \ hat { \ mathbf {i} }}, \ { \ hat { \ mathbf {j} }}, \ { \ hat { \ mathbf {k} }}} unit vectors along the axis directions
 The area σ of a parallelogram with sides a and b containing the angle θ is: which will be recognized as the magnitude of the vector cross product of the vectors a and b lying along the sides of the parallelogram
 That is: The square of this expression is: where γ is the Gram determinant of a and b defined by: In a similar fashion, the squared volume v of a parallelepiped spanned by the three vectors A, b and c is given by the Gram determinant of the three vectors: This process can be extended to n-dimensions
 Some of the following algebraic relations refer to the dot product and the cross product of vectors
 These relations can be found in a variety of sources, for example, see Albright

 Sagan has written frequently about religion and the relationship between religion and science, expressing his doubts about the traditional concept of God, a superior being
 udhaaharan ke liye: Some believe that God is a light-skinned male with a staggered white beard, working together with the fall of every chimney wherever he is seated in the sky on a throne
 dusron- udhaaharan ke liye barook spinoja or albert oinstin-maanate hai ki ishwar multah bhautik kanoonon kii kul raashi he jo brahmad kaa varnan karata he
 From some hidden astronomical point of view of human beings, there is no compelling evidence for the human patriarch controlling the fate of humans, but to deny the existence of physical laws would be insane
 bhagwaan kii avadharana ke bare main apane vichaar ke ek or vivaran main, sagan ne joardaar dhang se likhaa: The idea that God is a giant white male with a flowing beard that sits in the sky and lowers the level of the fall of every sparrow is strange but if God meant the same physical laws that governed the universe Is, so clearly there is such a God
 This God is emotionally satisfying 


 it doesn't matter much to pray to the law of gravity
 naastikta par, saagan ne 1981 main tippanee kii: An atheist is someone who is certain that God does not exist, someone who is a compelling proof against the existence of God
 i do not know any such compelling evidence because God is taken to distant times and places and to the ultimate cause
 Maybe, we need to know a lot about the universe to confirm that no such god exists

 palaayanwaad kaa koshgat arth he aisa sahitya jo jeevansangharsh se kuch samay ke liye hamen dur le ja sake; jaise jasusi upanyaas, sangitatmak sukhaant naatak, chitrapat aadi
 But after explaining this meaning, Shipley not only wrote in his English literature dictionary that escaping from life is not mandatory in escapist literature

 Thus the prevailing meaning of escapism is controversial

 The game of gambling in India is known as Akkashrida or Akshudyut
 veda ke samay se lekar aaj tak yah bharatiyon kaa atyant lokapriy khel rahaa he
 In a famous Sukta of the Rigveda, the Kittav draws an interesting picture of his plight that he does not ask him even to his best due to losing in gambling, what about others? He himself teaches - Aksharma Divya: Krishimitta Krishnasva
 mahabharat jaisaa pralayankari yuddh bhi akshakreeda ke parinamswaroop hi hua
 The followings of Panini's Ashtadhyayi and Kashika give a complete introduction to the nature of Akkashrida
 panini use aakshik kehete hai
 
 patanjali ne siddhhast dyutkar ke liye akshakitav yaa akshadhoort shabdon kaa prayog kiya he
 In Vedic period, there is no definite introduction to the content of gaming, but in Panini's time this game was played with Aksha and Shalaka
 kautilya ke arthshaastra kaa kathan he ki dyutadhyaksh kaa yah kaam he ki vah juadiyon ko rajya kii ore se khilne ke liye aksh or shalaka diya kare 
 In some ancient times, the axis was meant to be the seed of a bheda
 parantu panini kaal main aksh chaukani goti or shalaka ytaakar goti hoti thi
 The number of these pieces was five, which can be easily estimated from Taittiriya Brahmin and Ashtadhyayi
 brahmanon ke granthon main inke naam bhi paanch the- akshraj, krit, treta, dwapar tathaa kali
 Kashika calls this game as Panchika gaming for this reason
 panini ke akshashlaka sankhyah parina sutara main un dashaon kaa ullekh he jinamein goti phenkane vaale kii haar hoti thi or is sthiti kii soochna ke liye akshapari, shalakapari, ekapari, dwipari, tripari tathaa chatushpari padon kaa prayog sanskrit main kiya jaataa tha
 It is clear in the description of Kashika that if the above five pieces fell in mind or the platen fell, then in both the stages the thrower would win
 arthath yadi ek goti anya gotiyon kii avasthaa se bhinn hokar chitt yaa patt pade, to haar hoti thi or iske liye ekapari shabd prayukt hote the
 In the same way, the defeat of two pieces was called the Tripari and the defeat of four was triangular
 jeetne kaa daanv krit or haarane kaa daanv kali kehalaata tha
 This opposition to Krita and Kali is also indicated in Buddhist texts
 jue main baaji bhi lagaai jaati he or is dravya ke liye panini ne glah shabd kii siddhi maani he 
 Shakuni, the famous gambler of Mahabharata, is right to say that gambling is so infamous among people because of the betting
 mahabharat, arthshaastra aadi granthon se pataa chalata he ki jua sabha main khelaa jaataa tha
 The Smriti texts give a complete introduction to the rules of gambling
 arthshaastra ke anusaar juadi ko apane khel ke liye rajya ko dravya dena padataa tha
 The state received five per cent of the money appropriated as tax

 On the other hand, Lakshman killed the whole army of demons

 ayodhya main putr ke viyog ke kaaran dasharath kaa swargvaas ho gaya
 Vashistha called Bharata and Shatrughna from his maternal grandfather
 waapas aane par bharat ne apni mata kaikeyi kii, uski kutilata ke liye, bahut bhartasna kii or gurujanon ke aagyaanusaar dasharath kii antyeshti kriya kar diya
 Bharata rejected the kingdom of Ayodhya and refused Rama and went to Chitrakoot with all the affectionate

 Bharat, along with his affectionate people, came back to Ayodhya with Ram's paduka
 unhone ram kii paduka ko raaj singhaasana par virajit kar diya swayan nandigram main nivas karne lage
 After some time, Rama departed from Chitrakoot and reached the ashram of Atri Rishi
 atri ne ram kii stuti kii or unki patni anusuya ne sita ko pativrat dharm ke marm samajhaaye
 From there, Rama then proceeded further and met Sharbhang Muni
 sharbhang muni keval ram ke darshan kii kaamana se vahaan nivas kar rahe the atah ram ke darshanon kii apni abhilaashaa purna ho jane se yogagni se apane sharir ko jala daalaa or brahmalok ko gaman kiya
 And on proceeding, Rama was seen piling up bones from place to place, about whom the monks told Rama that the demons have eaten many sages and those are the bones of those sages
 is par ram ne pratigya kii ki ve samast rakshason kaa vadh karke prithvi ko rakshas viheen kar denge
 Rama proceeded further and met the sages like Sutixhan, Agastya etc
 in the path and entered Dandaka forest where he met Jatayu
 ram ne panchvati ko apana nivas sthaan banaaya
 In Panchavati, Ravana's sister Shurpanakha came and pleaded with Rama
 ram ne yah kah kar ki ve apni patni ke saath hai or unka chota bhai akelaa he use lakshmana ke paas bhej diya
 Laxman, rejecting his love, knowing the sister of the enemy, cut his nose and ears
 shurpanakha ne khar-dooshan se sahaayta kii maang kii or vah apni sena ke saath ladane ke liye aa gaya
 In the battle, Rama killed Khar-foul and his army
 shurpanakha ne jaakar apane bhai ravan se shikaayat kii
 Ravana sent Marich as a goldmine to take revenge, whose bark was demanded by Sita to Rama
 lakshmana ko sita ke raksha kii ajna de kar ram swarnamrig rupi marich ko maarane ke liye uske peeche chale gayi
 Marich was killed at the hands of the dying, but while dying, Marich made a voice of Rama and chanted 'ha Lakshman', which Sita apprehensively sent Laxman to Rama
 lakshmana ke jane ke baad akeli sita kaa ravan ne chhalpurvak haran kar liya or apane saath lanka le gaya
 On the way, Jatayu fought with Ravana to save Sita and Ravana cut his wings and made him half dead
 sita ko na paa kar ram atyant duhkhi huye or vilaap karne lage
 On meeting Jatayu on the way, he told Rama about his plight by Ravana and to take Sita to the south
 ye sab bataane ke baad jataayu ne apane praan tyaag diye or ram uskaa antim sanskaar karke sita kii khoj main saghan van ke bheetar aage bade
 On the way Rama slaughtered the Gandharva Kambandha, who became a demon due to the curse of Durvasa, and reached the ashram of Shabari where he ate the false beers given by him under his devotion
 is prakaar ram sita kii khoj main saghan van ke andar aage badhate gayi
 Rama came near Rishimuk mountain
 us parvat par apane mantriyon sahit sugriv rahata tha
 Sugriva, fearing that Bali might not have sent the two heroes to kill him, sent Hanuman as a Brahmin to get information about Rama and Lakshmana
 yah jaanane ke baad ki unhen baali ne nahin bheja he hanuman ne ram or sugriv main mitrataa karvaa di
 Sugriva consoled Rama that Janaki ji would be found and he would help in finding him as well as told about the atrocities committed on his brother Bali
 ram ne baali kaa chhalpurvak vadh kar ke sugriv ko kiskindha kaa rajya tathaa baali ke putr angad ko yuvaraj kaa pad de diya
 After attaining the kingdom, Sugriva indulged in luxury and the rain and autumn passed
 ram kii naaraazgi par sugriv ne vaanron ko sita kii khoj ke liye bheja
 The apes looking for Sita saw a tapaswini in a cave
 tapaswini ne khoj dal ko yogashakti se samudratat par pahunchaa diya jahaan par unki bhent sampaati se hui
 Sampati tells the monkeys that Ravana has placed Sita in Lanka Ashokavatika
 jambavant ne hanuman ko samudr langhane ke liye utsahit kiya
 Hanuman departed towards Lanka
 surasa ne hanuman kii pariksha lee or use yogya tathaa samarthyavan paakar aashirwad diya
 En route, Hanuman slayed the demon that caught the shadow and entered Lanka by striking Lankini
 unki vibhishana se bhent hui
 Ravana was threatening Sita when Hanuman arrived at the Ashokavatika
 ravan ke jane par trijata ne sita ko santavana di
 On solitude, Hanuman met Sita and gave him the ring of Rama
 hanuman ne ashokavatika kaa vidhwans karke ravan ke putr akshay kumaar kaa vadh kar diya
 Meghnath tied Hanuman in Nagpash and took him to the assembly of Ravana
 ravan ke prashn ke uttar main hanuman ne apana parichay ram ke doot ke rup main diya
 Ravana tied a cloth immersed in oil on Hanuman's tail and set it on fire, on which Hanuman burnt Lanka
 hanuman sita ke paas pahunche
 Sita gave her Chudamani and sent them away
 ve waapas samudr paar aakar sabhi vaanron se mili or sabhi waapas sugriv ke paas chale gayi
 Rama was very happy with Hanuman's work
 ram vaanron kii sena ke saath samudratat par pahunche
 On the other hand, Vibhishan explained to Ravana that he should not hate Rama, on which Ravana humiliated Vibhishan and drove him out of Lanka
 vibhishana ram ke sharan main aa gaya or ram ne use lanka kaa raja ghoshit kar diya
 Rama pleaded to give way to the sea
 vinati na maanane par ram ne krodh kiya or unke krodh se bhaybheet hokar samudr ne swayan aakar ram kii vinati karne ke pashchaat nal or nil ke dwaara pul banane kaa upaay bataaya
 By order of the brothers of apes Jambavan tap-nile bridge on the sea with the help of the army tied up
 shri ram ne shri rameshwar kii sthapana karke bhagwaan shankar kii puja kii or sena sahit samudr ke paar utar gayi
 Ram camped across the ocean
 pul bandha jane or ram ke samudr ke paar utar jane ke samachar se ravan man main atyant vyakul hua
 Ravana's arrogance did not go away even after Mandodari convinced him not to hate Rama
 idhar ram apni vanarasena ke saath subel parvat par nivas karne lage
 Angad went to Ravana in Lanka as Rama's messenger and gave him the message of Rama's asylum, but Ravana did not listen
 shaanti ke saare prayaas asafal ho jane par yuddh armbh ho gaya
 a fierce battle ensued between Laxman and Meghnad
 shaktibaan ke waar se lakshmana moorchhit ho gayi
 Hanuman brought Sushen Vaidya for his treatment and went to bring Sanjeevani
 guptchar se samachar milane par ravan ne hanuman ke kaary main baadha ke liye kaalanemi ko bheja jiskaa hanuman ne vadh kar diya
 Due to lack of identification of the medicine, Hanuman lifted the whole mountain and went back
 maarg main hanuman ko rakshas hone ke sandeh main bharat ne baan maar kar moorchhit kar diya parantu yatharth jaanane par apane baan par baitha kar waapas lanka bhej diya
 Seeing the delay in the arrival of medicine, Ram began to bleed
 sahi samay par hanuman aushadhi lekar aa gayi or sushen ke upachaar se lakshmana swasth ho gayi
 Ravana woke Kumbhakarna to battle
 kumbhkarna ne bhi ravan ko ram kii sharan main jane kii asafal mantranaa di
 In the war, Kumbhakarna attained supremacy at the hands of Rama
 lakshmana ne meghnad se yuddh karke uskaa vadh kar diya
 Many fierce wars took place between Rama and Ravana and in the end Ravana was killed by Rama
 vibhishana ko lanka kaa rajya saunp kar ram sita or lakshmana ke saath pushpakavimaan par chadh kar ayodhya ke liye prasthaan kiya
 Uttarkand is the epilogue to the Ram Katha
 sita, lakshmana or samast vanarasena ke saath ram ayodhya waapas pahunche
 There was a grand reception of Rama, joy spread among the people along with Bharata
 vedon or shiv kii stuti ke saath ram kaa rajbhishek hua
 The farewell of the visitors was given

 Along with the above things, Goswami Tulsidas ji visited Shri ram-vasishta Samvad in Uttarakhand, Narada ji coming to Ayodhya and praising Ramchandra ji, shiva-parvati dialogues, Garuda Moh and Garuda ji listening to Ramakatha and Rama-glory from Kakabhushundi ji Topics of Kakabhusundi ji's past life, knowledge-devotion formulation, enlightenment and great glory of devotion, seven questions of Garuda and answers of Kakabhushundi etc

 The remarkable renunciation of Lakshmana's wife Urmila in the Ramayana has probably been overlooked, and this mistake has been corrected by Maithilisharan Gupta, who composed Saket Khandakavya

 a well-known example of this is the address of a webpage on the world wide web
 jameendaari pratha bharat main mughal kaal evam british kaal main prachlit ek rajnatik-saamaajik kuriti thi jisamen bhoomi kaa swaamitv us par kaam karne waalon kaa na hokar kisi or kaa hota tha jo kheti karne waalon se kar vasuulate the
 This practice was abolished after India became independent
 bharat kii pracheen vichaardhaara ke anusaar bhoomi saarvajanik sampatti thi, isaliye yah vyakti kii sampatti nahin ho sakati thi
 Land, like air, water and light, was considered a gift of nature
 maharishi jaimini ke matanusaar "raja bhoomi kaa samarpan nahin kar saktaa tha kyonki yah uski sampatti nahin varan maanav samaaj kii sammilit sampatti he
 That is why everyone has equal rights over it "
 manu kaa bhi spasht kathan he ki "rishiyon ke matanusaar bhumiswamitv kaa pratham adhikaar use he jisane jangal katkar use saaf kiya tha jota" 
 Therefore, in a very large part of ancient India, the head of the village was elected by the village community and he was appointed with the consent of the state
 rajya use bhoomikar na dene par hataa saktaa tha, yadhyapi yah pad vanshanugat tha tathaa isaki prapti ke liye janamat tathaa rajyasweekruti aavashyak thi
 Therefore, those who are not elected were different from present-day landlords
 pracheen bharat main bhoomi kaa sampatti ke rup main krayvikray sambhav nahin tha
 This fact has also been confirmed by Western scholars Baden Powell and Sir George Campbell
 campbell kaa kathan he ki bhoomi jotane kaa adhikaar ek adhikaar maatr hi tha or hindu vyavastha ke anusaar bhoomi nahin mana gaya tha
 It has been known by modern research that in ancient India, there were feudatories, overheads, bhogikas, Pratiharas and Dandanayaks

 But we have not been sure about their rights and duties, except that these people used to send troops to their owners when needed

 According to Yajnavalkya regarding the land system, there were four classes, Mahipati, Kshetraswami, Krishak and Shikami
 acharya brihaspati ne kshetraswami ke sthaan main keval swami shabd kaa hi prayog kiya he parantu iskaa spashtikaran kar diya he ki swami, raja or khetihar ke madhya kaa varg tha
 The above description only indicates the classification of land holdings, and not to bring the farmer to the level of an Anglo slave
 mukhya prashn to yah he ki bhoomi par swatv adhikaar kisko - rajya ko, krishak ko athwa kisi madhyavarti varg ko vidwaanon ke matanusaar pracheen bharat main yah adhikaar hi tha jo swatv adhikaar nahin kaha ja saktaa
 We do not find any transformation in this ancient land during Yavana rule and neither is there any change in the basic principles of land-rights
 yavan shaasha bhoomikar gaanv ke mukhiya dwaara hi vasuul karte the or kabhi-kabhi sthaneey saradaaron vaa raajaaon dwaara, jo apana str gaanv ke mukhiya se unchaa hone kaa daawa karte the
 The claim of these kings appears to have produced an intermediate class between the state and the cultivator
 parantu samantvaad pad avrodh sthaayee rakhaa gaya tha kyonki rajya sarvada in raajaaon ko karmchaaree hi maanate the
 Although these kings were beginning to be hereditary, the state always had the right to grant and take back their post
 ek raja ke uttaradhikari ko raja kii sanad praapt karne ke liye prarthanapatr dena padataa tha or sanad kii prapti ke pashchaat hi vah raja hota tha
 In the Ainacabari, no intermediate class is recognized between the farmer and the state
 tathakthith raja or jameendaar saidhantik or vaastavik rup main keval kar vasuul karanevaale karmchaaree hi the
 It is notable that the Yavana rulers never claimed land-ownership-rights
 yah baat in aitihaasik tathyon se spasht he ki aurangzeb ne hundi, palam tathaa anya sthanon par krishakon se bhoomi kharidi thi, jaisaa akbar ne akbarabad or elahabaad main kile banane ke liye kiya tha
 Shah Jahan also did the same, it is proved from the above evidence that the Yavana rulers believed in property rights only in collecting taxes and not in the land
 unke shasankaal main krishak ke adhikaron ko ucchtam manyata di gai thi
 The farmer used to give it by the king and the head of the village and the king and the chief received remuneration for this work by the state
 san 1707 i0 main aurangzeb kii mrityu ke pashchaat krishakon ke adhikaron kaa lop dhire-dhire aarambh hua jab ki kendriya satta shithil padane lagi
 The sentiment of semi-feudal selfishness emerged during this time of monopoly
 jab rajya kii satta shithil padane lagi, rajya ke karmchaaree praja ke janmaal kii raksha karne main asamarth hone lage
 As a result, the villagers began to take the help of powerful employees and kings or chiefs for the protection
 in logon ne swabhaavat: sharnaarthi krishakon ke bhoomyadhikaron par akraman kiya
 Under these conditions, seedlings of Zamindari system are found
 parantu is sankatkaal main bhi krishakon ke bhoomyadhikaron kaa purna samarpan nahin hua tha
 Zamindari system started to emerge from the arrival of British in India
 angrej shaskaon kaa vishwaas tha ki ve bhoomi ke swami hai or krishak unki praja hai isaliye unhone sthaayee tathaa asthaayee bandobast bade krishakon tathaa raajaaon or jameendaaron se kiye
 Although impressed by the political rationale, he leased one pargana to the monopolist who collected every tax for five years
 is prakaar jameendaari pratha ko angrajon ne manyata pradaan kii yadhyapi aarambh main unka vichaar krishakon ko unke adhikaron se vanchit karne kaa nahin tha san 1786 i0 main lard corn walis, warren hestigaj ke baad, garvanar general hua
 Lord Cornwallis was also in favor of Zamindari system
 usne san 1791 i0 bengal, bihar tathaa urisa main das varshiya bandobast kii ajna di
 Two years later, the Board of Directors gave permission to make this ten-year plan a permanent settlement
 madras main jameendaari pratha kaa udai angrej shaskaon kii nilaam niti dwaara hua
 The lands of the villages were divided and auctioned and sold to the highest payer
 prarambh main avadh main bandobast krishak se hi kiya gaya tha parantu tadnantar raajnneetik kaarnon se yah bandobast jameendaaron se kiya gaya
 In the settlement report of the great historian Sir Vincent A
 Smith, Aligarh, it clearly acknowledges that the settlements were made to the monopolies, aiming only at utility, ignoring the prevailing land rights
 anyaaypurna karrashi ikattha karne kaa yah sabase saral upaay he tathaa yah raajnneeti ke drushtikon se bhi upyogi he kyonki iske falswaroop sarkaar kaa ek shaktishaalee tathaa dhani varg kii sahaayta milti rahegi
 Thus in the history of India for the first time these settlements established the class of landlords between the state and the farmers by the policy of the British, which resulted in the loss of the property rights of the farmers who had been in existence since time immemorial
 yah madhyavarti varg din prati din dhani hota gaya kyonki angrej shaasha apni karrashi main se adhik se adhik hissaa unhen pralobhan ke rup main dete rahe
 In these settlements, no attention was paid to the interests of the farmers, as a result of which their grief, humiliation and humiliation increased day by day
 kai baar angrej shaskaon ne bhi is ore dhyaan dilaayaa ki krishakon kii bhudhruti kii raksha kii jaay evam unka lagaan bandobast ke samay tak nirdhaarit kar diya jaay
 Still nothing was done
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki angrej shaskaon kii dharna thi ki jameendaaron ke saath vyavhaar main udaartaa dikhaane par jab ve sampann evam santusht rahenge to ve apane asamiyon ko nahin sataayenge jiske falswaroop ve bhi khushhaal rahenge
 But this was his great mistake because the landlords always betrayed their duty
 at: angrej shaasha yah mahasoos karne lage ki is bhul kaa sudhaar kiya jaae
 As a result, they arranged land related legislation to improve the condition of the farmers
 yah kadam jameendaari pratha ke ast kii disha main pratham charan kaha ja saktaa he
 In this first phase, which lasted from 1859 AD to 1929 AD, the laws that were enacted imposed certain restrictions on the rights of landlords to increase the rent and also benefited the higher class farmers
 kintu in kanoonon kaa mukhya uddeshy jameendaaron ko lagaan vasuul karne main sahuuliyat dene kaa tha jisase ve rajya ko rajasav thik samay par de saken
 In 1859 AD, the first land related act was passed
 yah adhinium samast british bharat ke liye ek adarsh bhoomi-adhinium tha jiske anuroop adhinium bharat ke sabhi bhaagon main paas hue or samay samay par unamem sanshodhan bhi kiye gaye taaki asantusht krishakon ko shant kiya ja sake
 But the landlords still continued to squeeze the peasants to recover their just and unjust taxes, which caused widespread dissatisfaction and restlessness among the farmers
 jameendaari pratha ke ast ke kram main doosraa charan san 1930 i0 se 1944 i0 tak rahaa
 During this time, peasant movements started happening all over the country
 in andolanon kaa beej ek kisaan sabha ne boyaa tha jo akhil bhartiya congress kii elahabaad baithak main taarikh 11 farvari san 1918 i0 ko hui thi
 After that the Congress started to advance the interests of the farmers

P
 Congress Committee on 27 October 1928 that political freedom is meaningless till the farmers get freedom from exploitation
 shanai: shanai: kisaanon kii jaagrukta badi or saath hi saath unki vyakulata bhi
 The peasant class became more vocal and demanded the stability of land holdings and reduction in revenue
 kisaan andolanon se prabhavit hokar raiyyatwarikshetron main nae adhinium banaae gaye jinase krishakon ke hiton kii raksha ho sake
 The Malabar Tenancy Act is a landmark in this regard
 iske baad bhopal land revenue act, 1935 tathaa assam tenency act 1935 paas hue
 Under the Government of India Act, 1935, when the 'special Autonomy' was inaugurated, the Provincial Governments arranged Land Reforms Acts which gave more rights to the farmers and curtailed the rights of the landlords
 you0 pi0 tenency act, 1939, tathaa bombai tenency act, 1939 vishisht udhaaharan aise vyapak adhiniyamon ke hai jinke dwaara krishakon ko maurusi adhikaar die gaye evam krishakon ke hit main jameendaaron ke katipay adhikaar chin liye gaye
 Even after the enactment of these Land Reforms Acts, the evils of the Zamindari system existed, although the Zamindars were paralyzed to a large extent
 in jameendaaron ko neh degree ji ‘british sarkaar kii atilaalit santan ’ kaha karte the
 He was a symbol of the past feudalistic practice which was completely contrary to modern conditions
 isliye indian neshnal congress ne kai baar is baat kii ghoshnaa kii ki jameendaari unmoolan ko congress ke kaarykram main pramukh sthaan dena chahie
 a farmer conference date was held on 27, 28 April 1935 in Allahabad under the chairmanship of Sardar Patel
 usne jameendaari unmoolan ko prastaav paas karke is ore ek pramukh kadam uthaaya is prastaav main yah ghoshnaa kii gai thi ki ‘gramakalyaan ke drushtikon se vartmaan jameendaari pratha bilkul vipareet he
 This practice was brought in the arrival of British rule and rural life has been completely destroyed by this'
 parantu san 1939 i0 main dwitiya vishwayuddh shuru ho jane ke kaaran bhoomi sudhaar kaa sara kaarykram ruuk gaya
 After the end of the war, the last phase of the end of Zamindari system started which lasted from 1945 to 1955
 yuddh samaapt hote hi british sarkaar ne 1945 i0 main government of india act 1935 i0 ke antargat prantiy sadanon ke chunaav karne kaa faisla kiya
 The Congress decided to participate in the elections and in December 1945 took out the election manifesto
 is ghoshnaptr main jameendaari unmoolan ke vishay main spashtatya kaha gaya ki ‘bhoomi vyavastha kaa sudhaar, jisaki bharat main ati aavashyaktaa he, krishakon tathaa rajyake bich madhyavarti varg ko hataane se sambandhit he
 Therefore the rights of this intermediate class should be obtained by giving proper compensation '
 is ghoshnaa patr se arthshaastri, raajnneetijna tathaa patrkaar sabhi sahamat the
 Zamindari system hindered Indian economic development because the big landlords were always advocates of reactionism
 ‘landan iconomist’ ne inke vishay main likhaa tha ki ‘inamen se adhiktar ‘thekarase’ ke paatr ‘lard steen’ kii tarah dushcharitra, ‘jine astine’ ke ‘mistar benet’ kii tarah aalsee, ‘surtijasquaire’ kii tarah sharaabi the 
 The Bengal Land Commission also came to the conclusion that 'permanent settlement of 1793 AD, for whatever reasons was deemed appropriate at that time, is unsuitable in today's situation and has created so many evils in the zamindari system that it is no longer in the interest of the nation Even the type is no longer useful
 ’ bhartiya tathaa paashchaatya arthvettaon kii raay main jameendaari unmoolan adhik krishi utpaadan ke liye atyaavashyak he
 In addition, this practice has ended in every part of the world due to lack of time
 punasch, yah pratha rajya ke liye adhik kharchili he
 Above all, this practice had reached such a state at this time that if it had not been eradicated, it would have caused disasters not only on national economic problem but also on social security

 The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the first known list of the most notable man-made creations of ancient antiquity, and the books on them were popularly popular among Greek sight-saints and include works located only around the Mediterranean
 jo saat kii sankhya main chunaa gaya tha kyonki unaniyon ne ise mana or bahuto dwaara ise pratinidhitiv kiya gaaya
 Many similar lists have been made for medieval world and modern world
 saanchaa:main The historian Herodotus, and the scholar Callimachus of Cyrene at the Museum of Alexandria, made early lists of seven wonders but their writings have not survived, except as references
 The seven wonders included: The earliest lists had the Ishtar Gate as the seventh wonder of the world instead of the Lighthouse of Alexandria
 The Greek category was not Wonders but "thaumata", which translates closer to "things to be seen"
 The list that we know today was compiled in the Middle Ages — by which time many of the sites were no longer in existence
 Today, the only ancient world wonder that still exists is the Great Pyramid of Giza
 Many lists of wonders of the world are said to have existed during the Middle Ages, although it is unlikely that these lists originated at that time because the word medieval was not even invented until the Enlightenment-era, and the concept of a Middle Age did not become popular until the 16th century
 Brewer's refers to them as "later list" suggesting the lists were created after the Middle Ages
 Many of the structures on these lists were built much earlier than the Medieval Ages, but were well known
 These lists go by names such as Wonders of the Middle Ages, Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages, Medieval Mind and Architectural Wonders of the Middle Ages
 Typically representative of the seven greatest wonders of the Medieval world are: Other sites included on such lists: Many lists have been made of the greatest structures built during modern times or of the greatest wonders existing today
 Some of the most notable lists are presented below
 The American Society of Civil Engineers compiled a list of wonders of the modern world: In 2001 an initiative was started by the Swiss corporation new7wonders Foundation to choose the New Seven Wonders of the World from a selection of 200 existing monuments for profit
 Twenty-one finalists were announced January 1, 2006
 Egypt was not happy with the fact that the only original wonder would have to compete with the likes of the Statue of Liberty, the Sydney Opera House, and other landmarks; and called the project absurd
 To solve this, Giza was named an honorary Candidate
 The results were announced on July 7 2007 in Benfica's stadium in a big ceremony in Lisbon, Portugal, and are listed here: In November 2006 the American national newspaper USA Today in conjunction with the American television show Good Morning America revealed a list of New Seven Wonders as chosen by six judges
 The wonders were announced one per day over a week on Good Morning America
 An eighth wonder was chosen on November 24 from viewer feedback
 Similar to the other lists of wonders, there is no consensus on a list of seven natural wonders of the world, as there has been debate over how large the list should be
 One of the many lists was compiled by CNN: new7wonders of Nature is a contemporary effort to create a list of seven natural wonders chosen by people through a global poll, organized by New Open World Corporation, which ran the New Seven Wonders of the World campaign
 Seven Natural Wonders: is a not for profit endeavour created to protect the seven natural wonders that have already been established
 The Seven Underwater Wonders of the World was a list drawn up by CEDAM International, an American-based non-profit group for diversion, dedicated to ocean preservation and research

 Eugenie Clark, to pick underwater areas which they considered to be worthy of protection
 The results were announced at The National Aquarium in Washington DC by actor Lloyd Bridges, star of tv's Sea Hunt: British author Deborah Cadbury wrote Seven Wonders of the Industrial World, a book telling the stories of seven great feats of engineering of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
