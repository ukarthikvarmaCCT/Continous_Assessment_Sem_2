 kathini yaa crusteshia jeevajgat main sandhipad jeevon kaa ek mukhya vibhaag he, jisamen bade kekad, jhinge, chingt, prachingt, mahachingt, khandavar, kashtha euka tathaa jalpinshu ityadi hai, parantu iske sabase chote jeevon ko dekhne ke liye anuvikshan yantra kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 There is a huge difference in the type of difficulty of different castes, due to which it is very difficult to give a brief definition
 kathini kaa prayek lakshan, visheshkar iske parashrayi tathaa ucch vishesh jeevon main to, purna rup se kisi na kisi prakaar badal jaataa he
 The term crustacea has been used initially for those creatures whose armor is rigid and ductile
 iske vipareet duusare jeev ve hai jinka kavach tathaa bhangur hota he, jaise sip tathaa ghonghe ityadi
 But now it is known that the external skeleton of all arthropods is hard and soft
 is kaaran ab kathini ko anya lakshanon ke pruthak kiya jaataa he
 The creatures of this class are mostly water dwellers and there is no such reservoir in the world where there is no caste found in them
 is kaaran kathini varg ke jeev praaia: jalashvasanika athwa twachaa se shwaas lete hai
 These include two pairs of horns in front of the mouth and three pairs behind the face of Hanu
 kathini varg ke mukhya parichit jeev to jhingen or kekade hai jinka upyog maanav apane khaadya rup main karata he, parantu inase kahin adhik aarthik mahatv ke iske nimna jeev anfipadz,, isopidz, ityadi, hai jo uthle jalaashyon main samoohon main rahete hue sammarjak kaa kaam karte hai
 The food of these lower creatures are the objects of other creatures and flora, as well as they themselves become the food of higher beings, such as fish etc
 iske kai talaplavi sookshm jeev aise bhi hai jinke samooh milon tak sagar ke rang ko badal dete hai, jisase machhuon ko uchit matsaysthanon kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 In this way, they provide economic benefits by becoming fish meal as well as helping the fishermen
 is varg ke jeevon kaa kavach duusare sandhipad jeevon ke samaan hi khandon ke samoohon main vibhajit rahata he, parantu inamen se praaia: kuch khand ekibhanjit bhi haate hai
 Each segment is similar to the armor ring, which is attached to the flexible integum with its front and back sections
 prayek khand kaa chaap sadrush prishthiya patt, sternam kehalaata he or turgam ke donon parshv bhaag, jo patton ke rup main rahete hai, plura kehalaate hai
 a pair of limbs are attached to the sternum of each segment
 sharir kaa antim khand, jisapar guda hoti he, angahin rahata he or telson kehalaata he
 In modern difficulty, no such organism is found in which each segment is clearly distinct from each other
 udaahranarth, jhinge ke sharir ke agrabhag kaa kavach avibhajit tathaa naalakaar hota he or kairapes kehalaata he
 The number of its segments is estimated by the number of components associated with this part
 is bhaag main sanyukt khandon kii sankhya kam se kam chah maani gai he jisamen naitrik khand bhi sammilit hai
 This part is called head
 jab is bhaag main isse adhik khand sammilit rahete hai tab iske badwaale khandon ke avyav agle avyavon se purnat: pruthak hote hai
 The back sections of the head are divided into two parts of the body, chest and abdomen, which are separated by their different components
 parantu ucch kathini mailaakanstraca ityadi main vaksh ke khand sir main sammilit ho jate hai
 Then this joint part is named as Shirsovaksha
 is prakaar kairapes kaa rup bhi bhinn-bhinn kathini jeevon main anek prakaar paaya jaataa he
 It completely covers the body and limbs in the form of bivalve shells in Branchiopoda and Ostracoda, in the cirrpedia it is a muscular cavity shaped and calcified bandage is also placed to reinforce it
 ye to iske kuch vishesh rup hai, parantu saadhaaran naalakaar rup ke kairapes main vaksh ke ek se lekar saare khand sir main sammilit ho sakate hai
 Carapace is found in almost all of the various difficulties
 keval anestroca hi jeev hai jinamein kairapes nahin hota
 The convergent extremity of the body of difficulty is found in its parasitic and suspended organisms
 khandavar apni prachhdhavastha main apane sir se mulabaddha rahete hai or saath hi unamem radial samamiti kii ore pravriti hoti he jiskaa kaaran inkaa sthagit jivan he
 In parasitic organisms, the body segment has disappeared and the shape of the body has also changed completely
 iskaa udhaaharan rizosephala he, jisamen kathini ke lakshan to kya, sandhipad jeevon kaa bhi koi lakshan praudhavastha main nahin dikhaai detaa
 Difficult creatures are mainly forest dwellers
 is kaaran anumaan kiya jaataa he ki is varg ke purvaj kaa sharir samaan khandon main vibhajit tha or prayek khand par ek jodi ang jude the
 Each of their components used to do all the work together like circulation, food, respiration and knowledge
 trilobita main avyavon kii aisi hi vyavastha maani gai he, parantu yah upvarg lupt ho gaya he
 Till now, no such creature has been found in the modern difficulty, whose components consist of these four tasks together
 iske sir ke ang to bhinn-bhinn vishesh kaaryon ke liye upyukt hote hai, parantu brankiopoda ke dhad ke avyav ek samaan hote hai or kuch seemaa tak mana ja saktaa he ki inase chaaron kaary hote hai
 Otherwise, the feature of organs has advanced in difficulty in many ways, because it is known that the organs which do one task in some difficulty, do the other tasks in the other difficulty
 kathini ke bheetar kaa vikaas mukhyat: in angon ke hi kartavya main niyantran par aadhaarit he
 No matter how hard the components are used for any task and no matter how different in size, their structure is mainly bicameral
 prayek avyav kaa aadhaarit vrutt dwikhandi hota he or ise sympod yaa protopodit kehete hai or iske upree khand se do shakhaayen endopodit or exopotide nikalati hai
 This type of root based ingredient is called Steinopodium
 aise saadhaaran dwishakhi avyav kopipod ke plavan pad, mailocostraca ke udar ang ityadi hai or aise hi ang purvaj dimbh main bhi, jise nopleius kehete hai, paae jate hai
 Similar elements take different forms for special tasks in other difficult organisms
 kathini ke netra do prakaar ke hote hai madhyam tathaa sanyukt netra
 Very simple middle eye noplias and many adults live in hardships, but in malacostraca they disappear and the combined eye is the working eye
 sanyukt netra praaia: ek jodi hote hai, jo kuch jeevon ke avrunt or kai ek main vrintyukt rahete hai
 The eye is considered to be a component of the head, but it is suspicious
 kaaran, parivardhan main yah duusare angon main bahut pashchaat udit hote hai
 The first horns, which remain in front of the mouth, are considered components of the second section
 yah nopleius tathaa sab upjatiyon ke jeevon main, keval mailocostraca ke atirikt, ekasakhi hoti hai
 Their main function is sensor, but in many eggs and adult difficulties they also come in the function of flotation and many males also capture the female from the ring
 siropedia main cement grathiyon ke chhidr inhen avyavon par hote hai, jinaki sahaayta se inke vayask sthagit hote hai
 Although the second horn is located in front of the mouth, it was actually located behind the mouth
 nopleius main iskaa sthaan mukh ke parshv main rahata he or yah bhojan ko mukh kii ore laane main sahaayta detii he
 The rest of its work is similar to the first ring
 melacostraca main isaki ek shakha bahusandhimaan kashang ke aakaar kii hoti he or iskaa kaary keval samvedan grahan he, parantu duusari shakha kaa aakaar chapate patt ke samaan hota he or yah plavan main santolan kaa kaary bhi karti he
 In Noplius and Vyaska Kopipoda, Isopoda, etc
, the adjoins are bicellular and help in feeding, but in many difficulties, the adjoins form the shape of Hanu and their surface is equipped with teeth and condoms
 parashrayi kathini ke adhohanu bedhan ke liye nalaakaar shund ke sadrush hote hai
 The protuberant and subalpine, or first and second maxillae, are always flattened like leaves, and the branches of Hanu are situated on their branches
 ye teenon mukh ke pichhali hanu hai
 In the posterior parts of the head, there is no particular difference between the bronchiopoda, copipoda etc
 and these organs are mainly similar
 inkaa aakaar melacostraca ke upjanbhak or upasambh main miltaa-julata hota he
 These types of ingredients are called filopodia
 parantu melacostraca ke dhad ke angon ko do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he-aath jodi vaksh ke avyav tathaa chah jodi udar ke avyav 
 They are completely different from each other
 vaksh ke avyav mukhyat: gati karne ke kaam main aate hai or isi kaaran inke endopodide, jo is kaary main pramukh bhaag lete hai, usee prakaar parivirtat ho jate hai, parantu inke exopodide, jo plavan main upyogi hote hai, inamen lupt ho gaye hai
 Before the thorax one or two pairs of components are often of a pectoral shape, due to which they are named Anupada
 udar ke ang sadaa dwishakhi or plavan main upyogi hai
 The tail helps the organism in a special way by reversing the shape of the tail of the tail with the help of the last abdomen
 adhiktar nimna kathini sharital se saans lete hai, parantu jin jeevon kaa bahi:kankal adhik kathor ho gaya he ve shwasan kaary apane un sharirsthanon se karte hai jahaan kaa tal ksheen rah gaya he, jaise kairapes kaa astr; athwa yah kaam vishesh indriyon dwaara hota he, jinako jalashvasanika kehete hai
 Water reservoirs are the branches on the chest or its limbs, which are flattened in shape and whose blood flows within the microscopic walls
 decapoda main jalshvanikaaye apni sthiti ke aadhaar par teen shreniyon main rakhi gai hai-vakshangamul kii shakhikaaye, vakshaangon ke sameep kii shakhikaaye tathaa brankial mandal bhitari bhaag jo kerapes se dhake rahete hai
 Thalanivasi hardships, such as crabs, etc
, are well adapted to respiration — the floor of the lining of their brachial system acts as a lung
 anya jeevon main, jaise isopoda, kashthauka ityadi main, udarangon main shakhavinyast vaayu bhari nalikaay pai jaati hai, jo keet tathaa anya sthaljivon kii shwasanaliyon ke samaan hoti hai
 In difficulties, the alimentary canal is always straight throughout the body from front to end
 parantu is varg ke kuch aise jeev bhi hai jinamein yah nyudeshtit athwa kundalit bhi pai jaati he
 Like other arthropod organisms, it too is divided into three parts
 agrantra tathaa pashchantra, jinke chhidr mukh tathaa guda hai or jinka aantarik tal kytin se, jo bahya sharir ke kytin ke saath sanlagn rahata he, aachhadit rahete hai
 The third part is the middle, which lives between them
 agrantra kii peshiyaan prabal hoti hai or inke antareey tal par bal, kaante tathaa daant ityadi viksit rahete hai
 In Melacostraca, this part forms the stomach, in which gastric, gizzard and filtration equipment are special means to separate food juices from particles
 parantu peshni tathaa chanani praaia: hrideey tathaa nizthreey vibhaagon main pruthak rahete hai
 At the front end of the mid-intestine, there are a pair or more of liver cells whose functions are absorption and secretion and out of which branch can also form liver
 decapoda main yakrut granthi praaia: saare aavashyak enzim banaati he or saath apni guha se vanchit padaarthon kaa shoshan bhi karti hai
 In this, food is stored in the form of glycogen
 kuch decapoda main madhyantra bahut choti hoti he jiske kaaran aaharanlee keval agr tathaa pasch antra kii bani vidit hoti he
 In parasitic difficult organisms, the food pipe is either nominal or it is absolutely lacking
 anya sandhipad jeevon kii bhanti kathiniyon main bhi rudhir sharirguha tathaa gantikaon main pravaahit hota he
 Like other arthropods, the heart is also located within the posterior cardiovascular cavity
 brankiopoda, austracada tathaa kuch melacostraca main hriday praaia: sharir kii puri lambaai ke baraabar hota he or sharir ke antim bhaag khand ke atirikt prayek khand main isamen ek jodi kapatyut andhra hota he, jo hridayaavaran se ja miltaa he
 In other difficulties, the heart length is usually less
 dhamniyaan hriday se nikalakar rudhirsthanon main khulti hai, jahaan se rudhir sharir ke prayek bhaag tathaa ang se hota hua hridayaavaran main aata he
 The reservoir is located in this part to oxygenate the blood
 anek kathini aise bhi hai jinamein hriday nahin hota, jaise siripedia, kopipoda ityadi or inamen rudhiravahan sharir tathaa aharnali ke sanchaalan kii sahaayta se hota he
 Difficulties are the bloody fluid in which leukocyte is added and hemoglobin is also present in Entomestraca
 kathini kii mukhya utsarjan indriyaan shringika sambandhi tathaa upbhanj sambandhi do jodi granthiyaan hai jo inhen naamon ke angon ke aasthaanon par khulti hai
 The complete development of both the glands is never found together in one stage of any caste, so in different stages in the history of life, one after the other is functioning
 udaahranarth, jhinge tathaa duusare dashapadon kii vayask avasthaa main shringika sambandhi granthi kaaryshil hoti he or inke dimbh main upasambh sambandhi
 But most of the difficulties have the opposite situation
 inamen in donon grathiyon kii rachana ek samaan hoti he
 Each gland has three main parts: 1
 Antune, which is a remnant of the dehgue and a dilapidated inner part, 2
 Excretory canal and 3
 Altered exit system, which is connected to the antune and one part of which is the excitatory tube of adenoid wall
 
 utsargi nalika kaa adhar bhaag tathaa bahirgaman pranali donon badi hokar sangrahi mutrashay banaati hai
 The normal form of the central nervous system is also similar to other arthropod organisms
 mastishk kaa sanyog pratiprushthiya tantrikaraju ke saath parigrasika sanyojak ke dwaara rahata he
 The anterograde neuralgia is a double chain of tufts that are joined together by aggregates and joints
 praaia: chaar jodi bhruneey gucchhikaaye aapas main milakar mastishk banaati hai or netra gucchhika bhi isi main sammilit he
 In difficulty, in the state of the nervous system, there is a complete range from the ideal condition of the arthropods to the very concentric condition
 aadim brankiopoda main pratiprishth gucchhikaaon kii shrinkhalaa sidhiyon ke aakaar kii hoti he jaisi kuch enilidz main pai jaati he or jisamen shrinkhalaa ke donon bhaag ek duusare se pruthak rahete hai
 In other difficult groups, the two parts of the chain are often reconciled, as well as the flakes coming close to each other
 is shrenee kii antim dasha main, jo kekadon main pai jaati he, keval gucchhikaaon kaa ek samooh hi dikhaai detaa he
 Like independent and active organisms, the sexes are often different in difficulty, but the animals of Cirrpedia and many parasitic isopodas are also bisexual
 ye purvapumpakv hote hai jinamein pulling angon kaa parivardhan streeling angon se pehle hota he
 The micro-complementary males in seripedia, like parasites, often cling to ordinary or hermaphrodites of this caste, because their male parts cannot fully conceive
 anek brankiopoda tathaa austracoda main anishek janan bhi hota he

 In order to leave the nose, mouth and breath during a cough or sneeze, the bacteria spreads to the surroundings and the environment, which causes infection in other children

 One more thing is that when the cough is showing its gruesome form, then immediately after that it vomits and everyone eats and drinks

 If the disease is diagnosed in the initial stage, then the use of antibiotics can prove to be very beneficial
 irithromicine yaa ampisilin kaa prayog saat se das dinon tak kiya jaataa he
 Nowadays chloramphenicol is highly treated because this drug is highly inexpensive
 ghabrahat dur karne ke liye bhi inaki goliyaan di ja sakati hai

 Template: Immanuel Kant kanti nitishastra kaa sandarbh ek kartavyavaigyanik nitishastreey siddhanth se hai, jiskaa sambandh german darshanik emanuele kant se hai
 Which was presented by the German philosopher Emmanuel Kant
 yah siddhant europea gyanoday yug ke parinaam swarup viksit hua tha, yah is drushtikon par aadhaarit he ki aantarik rup se ek shubh sankalp hi shubh kaary he;ek kaary keval tabhi shubh ho saktaa he yadi uske pich siddhant ho- ki naitik niyamo kaa paalan ek kartavya ki tarah kiya jaye
 The central point of Kant's structure of moral rules is the invariant duty mandate that applies equally to all humans regardless of their interests and wishes
 kaant ne nirapavaad kartavyadesho ko vibhinn tareeko se sutarabaddh kiya he
 According to his principle of universalism, any act is permissible only when it is possible to be implemented by all people without any contradiction
 agar virodhabhas utpan hota he to yah arastu kii gaiyr-virodhabhas kii avadharna ke niyam kaa ulalanghan karegaa jo yah nirdhaarit karti he kii uchit kaary virodhabhas kaa kaaran nahin ban sakate he
 Kant's formulation of humanity is the second section of the invariable duties which states that for its purpose, humans should never treat others merely for the sake of means, but should do the same for others as they wish for themselves
 swaittata kaa sutrikaaran nishkarsh nikalataa he ki tarksangat kaarak naitik niyamo se apni icchaanusaar bandhe hue hote he jabaki ant kaa samrajya me kaant kii sankalpana he he-log vaisaa vyavhaar karte he jaise kii unke kaaryo ke siddhant vidhi dwaara kisi kalpit samrajya ke liye sthapit kar diye gaye ho
 Kant has also distinguished between absolute duties and non-performing duties
 ek purna kartavya he jaise ki kabhi jhooth na bolne kaa karttavya, hameshaa sach ko dhaaran kare rakhana; ek apurna karttavya he jaise kii daan karne kaa karttavya jise kisi vishesh samay or sthaan ke anusaar lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 American philosopher Lewis Pozman cited that the modern debate between pietism, political philosopher jean-jacques Rousseau, rationalism and empiricism, and the influence of natural law influenced the development of Kant's ethics
 duusare darshanashastriyo kaa mat he ki kaant ki naitikta ko unke mata-pita or unke shikshak martin natjan se prabhavit he kanti naitikta se prabhvit logo main darshanik darshanik jurgan haburmas ,raajnneetik darshanik jon rals ,or manovishleshak jacks lekan shaamil hai
 The German philosopher George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel criticized Kant on the grounds that Kant did not give a specific account of the factors influencing decision in his moral theory and excluded human nature
 german darshanashastri arthur shopenhavar ne tark diya kii naitikta kaa uddeshy yah varnan karnaa he ki logo kaa vyavahar kaisaa hona chahie tathaa kaant ke siddhant kaa aadeshtmak hone kii kaaran unki aalochana ki
 Michael Stocker argues that simply showing duty as acting may impair other moral motivations such as friendliness, while Marcia Baron defends the theory by arguing that duty does not impair other motivations
 catholic girjaghar ne isai naitikta ko gun naitikta ke adhik sangat bataaya he tathaa kaant kii naitikta ko isai naitikta ke virodhabhasi bataa kar isaki aalochana kii he
 It is claimed that all human beings are autonomous because of their dignity and respect that medical professionals should be happy to treat anyone and treat them only because they are useful to society
 yon naitikta ke prati kaant kaa drushtikon is vichaar se saath ubhara kii maanvo kaa upyog keval saadhan saadhane maatr ke liye nahin hona chahie yon gatividhiyon kii or jane par unhone kuch yon prathao ko nindaneey or apmaan janak bataaya udhaahrantaa: vivahetar yon sambandh
 Feminist philosophers have used the Kanti Ethics to condemn practices such as prostitution and ritualism because they use women only as a means
 kaant isamen vishwaas karte the ki kyoki jaanavar tarksangat nahin he isliye sivaae kuch apratyaksh kartyavyo ko chhodkar hamaare kartavya unke prati nahin ho sakate jais unke prati krurta naa karke aniatik swabhaav ko viksit nahin karnaa
 Kant has presented the lie as an example in his ethics and has stated that it is our absolute duty that we should always tell the truth even if it seems to us that there will be better results in lying than telling the truth
 Must hold on to the truth yadhpi kaant ke sabhi kaaryo ne unki naitikta ke siddhant ko viksit kiya he yah bahut spasht rup se unke dwaara rachit pustake naitikta ke aadhyatmik tatwon kaa aadhaar, vyavhaarik karno ki samiksha or naitikta ke aadhyatmik tatv me paribhashit he
 Being part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant's theory of morality is based on the idea that the reason behind the behavior of the people should be used to determine the reason behind it
 iske liye unhone koi vishisht kaarywahi kaa nirdhaaran nahin liya, par nirdeshit kiya ki logo kaa vyavhaar kaisaa ho iske liye vayavhaar ke peeche kya kaaran hona chaiye iskaa upyog kiya janaa chahie
 By his joint work, Kant created the basis of moral law by the conception of duties
 Kant started his moral theory with the argument that only those qualities which are perfectly auspicious can be an auspicious resolution
 koi doosraa gun iskaa sthaan nahin le saktaa kyoki anya aacharnon kaa upyog aniatik prayojanon ko praapt karne ki liye kiya ja saktaa he 
 The characteristic of an auspicious resolution is that it always maintains moral values even if it fails to fulfill its moral objectives
 kaant ne man he ki shubh sankalp hi ek naitik siddhant he jo ki anya guno ke naitik parinamo kii prapti ki liye swatantraaa purvak angikaar kiya ja saktaa he
 The auspicious resolution is a broader concept than the resolution for Kant which represents the duties
 ek sankalp jo kartavyon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he us sankalp se alag he jo kii naitik niyamo ko banaye rakhane ke liye baadhaon par kaabo pataa he
 Similarly, a dutiful resolution is a special case of auspicious resolution which is visible in adverse conditions
 kaant kaa tark ki keval keval kartavyon ke sambandh me kiye gaye kaaryo kaa naitik mulya he
 However, it cannot be said that acts performed only for the performance of duties are meaningless
 par yah yah vishesh sammaan un krityo ko diya jaataa he jo kartavyon se baahar jaakar kiye jate he
 The concept of Kant's duties is not that people do their duties reluctantly
 haalanki karttavya praayah logo ko unke ruchi ke viruddh kaary karne ki liye prerit karte he, yah un kartao kii ichhashakti se aata he jo naitik niyamo ko banaaye rakhane ki aakanksha rakhte he
 Therefore, the doer acts towards his duties because rational encouragement has more importance than his interest
 kaant bahari tor se lagaaye kartavyon ki rup me saamaanya naitik dharna se aage badhanaa chaahate the jo ki swytta kii naitikta ko prastut kare evam jise tarksangat karko dwaara swatantra rup se pahachaanaa gaya ho or banaaya gaya ho
 The duty arises on invoking the mandate of duty because the failure to follow them results in either contradiction in thoughts or contradiction in resolutions
 kartavyon ko do virgo me vibhajit kiya gaya he jisame pehla purna kartavya tathaa doosraa apurna kartavya he
 It is an absolute duty to keep the truth always, so never lie because it is our absolute duty to tell the truth
 ek apurna kartavya lacheelepan ki anumati detaa he upkaar karnaa ek apurna kartavya he kyoki ham har samay upkaar karne ke liye baadhya nahi hote he
 But you can apply it according to the time and place
 kaant kaa vishwaas tha ki apurna kartavyo ki apeksha purna kartavya adhik mahatvapurn he
 If a contradiction arises between these duties, then full duties should be performed
 kaant ki naitikta kaa pratham sutrikaran nirapavaad kartavyadesh he, jisase inhone chaar or sutara praapt kiye he
 Kant has pointed out the distinction between invariable duty and abolition order
 An abolition order is one which we must follow to fulfill our wishes
 chikitsak ke paas janaa ek abhyugat aadesh he kyoki hai ham iskaa paalan karne ke liye tabhi baadhya he jabaki ham swasth laabh chaahate he| nirapavaad kartavyadesh hamaari ichchhaaon ke viruddh kaary karne ki liye baadhya karata he; sabhi kaa yah karttavya he kii kabhi jhooth na bole chaahe koi bhi paristhiti ho or yahan tak kii aisa karne kii agar hamaari ruchi to tab bhi nahin
 This invariable duty mandate is morally binding as they are based on some reason rather than any contingent facts about the subject
 This is contrary to the order of objection which compels us only as long as we are part of a society towards which we have a duty
 ham nirapavaad kartavdesho ko nahin tyaag sakate kyoki ham budhimat karno ko nahin tyaag sakate; ek tarksangat karta hone ke naate hame tarksangat hone kaa karttavya praapt hota he isliye tarksangat naitik siddhant sabhi sabhi tarksangat kartao par har samay lagu rahete he
 Universality is the first formulation of Kant's absolutism
 kaant kii liye jab koi is niyam yaa siddant kii anusaar kaary karata he to kaary karata he to kaary keval tabhi uchit he, yadi vah is siddhant ke anukool he jo anumati detaa he kii vahi kaary saarvbhaumik hoga jiskaa paalan sabhi ke dwaara karnaa sambhav ho sake
 This theory will fail in this test if it universally produces either contradiction in concept or contradiction in resolutions
 avdhaaranon me virodhabhas utpann hota he jabaki kisi siddhant ko saarvbhaumik hona tha vah samaj ko roak de "kyoki siddhant aavashyak rup se khud ko nasht kar degaa jaise hi vah saarvbhaumik kanoon ban jaataa he"
 For example, if the principle of non-adherence to the word becomes permissible and universal, then no one will believe anyone's word and the idea of the word will be completely meaningless and this principle will create contradiction in itself
 Its universality will prevent the meaningfulness of the promise
 yah siddhant naitik bhi nahin hoga kyoki ise taarkik rup se saarvbhaumik lagu kiya janaa asambhav he- kyoki ham aisi duniya kii kalpana nahin kar sakate jaha kiyah siddhant saarvbhaumik ho jaye
 This theory becomes unethical even when it is contradictory to resolutions when it is universal, it does not mean logical contradiction
 parantu jab ki koi bhi buddhijivi yah nahin chahta ho ki yah siddhant saarvbhaumik ho tathaa rajyon ke maamlo kii aguwai kare
 Julia Driver has given an example to argue that the principle "I will not donate" will create contradictions in resolutions when it becomes universal, because a world where no one donates will be unpleasant for the person who according to this theory Do work kaant kaa maananaa tha ki naitikta kaa kaaran uddeshy he jaise ki bhautik niyam bhautik kaaryo ke liye aavashyak he vaise tarksangat niyamo ko uddeshy tarksangat kaary kaa karnaa he unhone aage vishwaas kiya ki puri tarah se tarksangat vyakti ko puri tarah se naitik bhi hona chahie kyoki puri tarah se tarksangat vyakti paata he ki tarksangat rup se kya karnaa aavashyak he
 Because humans are not completely logical, Kant believed that humans' own subjective desires must conform to rational rules that they termed conformity obligations
 kaant ne tark kiya ki karno kii vidhi kaa uddeshy praathmik he jo kii tarksangat praaniyon me bahari rup se viddhman he jaise kii bhautik niyam bhoti praaniyon se pehle maujuud he isliye kaant ke anusaar taarkik naitikta saarvbhaumik he or ise paristhitiyon ke anusaar badla nahin ja saktaa he
 The second formulation of Kant's absolutist duty is to treat humans the way we want to be towards ourselves
 kaant ne tark diya ki taarkik praaniyon se kabhi keval apane saadhan saadhane maatr ke liye bartaav nahin kiya ja saktaa, unke saath vaisaa hi bartaav kiya janaa chahie jaisaa ke ant me ham swayan ke prati chaahate he kyoki yah aavashyak he ki unke swayan ke tarksangat moolbhaavo ko saamaan rup se sammaan diya janaa chahie
 Kant has claimed that reason motivates morality and demands that we respect the motives of humans and all other beings as the cause
 ek tarksangat praani isse sahamat nahin ho saktaa use saadhan saadhane maatr ke liye prayukt kiya jaye isliye unhen hameshaa saadhy ke rup may bartaav kiya janaa chahie| kaant ne tark dekar bataaya kii naitik daayitv ek tarksangat aavashyaktaa he jo tarksangat sankalp he vah naitik rup se sahi he kyoki sabhi tarksangat kaarak taarkik rup se saadhy ho jaayenge par keval saadhan hona maatr hona pasand nahin karenge atah yah naitik rup se anivaary he ki ham is tarah bartaav kare
 This does not mean that we can never use human beings as a means, but when we do this, we also treat us in a negative way
 kaant kaa swayatta kaa niyam is vichaar ko vyakt karata he ki koi karta bahari prabhaav kii bajaaye apane tarksangat ichha ke kaaran nirapavaad kartyavadesho kaa paalan karne ke liye baadhya hota he
 Kant believed that any moral law motivated by the desire to fulfill any other interest would invariably deny the obligations and argued that moral law should only arise from rational resolution
 is siddhant ki maang he ki logo ko swytta ke kaary karne ke liye dusro ke adhikaron ko pahchaanane ki aavashyaktaa he iskaa matlab he ki naitik kanoon saarvbhaumik hona chahie yadi vah ek vyakti ki aavashyaktaa he to sabhi vyaktiyon kii bhi vahi aavashyaktaa ho
 This formulation requires that work should be understood as if its doctrine is to provide a law for an imaginary empire that a community of rational actors would accept as law
 Everyone in this community will accept the principle that they can be operated without using any person only for means
 halaaki kingdom of and ek adarsh he— anya logo ke kaaryo or praakrit ghatanyao se yah sunishchit hota he ki achche aashay se hone vaale kaary se kabhi kabhi nuksaan daayak parinaam utpann hote he atah hamen is adarsh samrajya ke vyavasthaapak ke rup me kaary karne ki aavashyaktaa he
 Amanda and Khethani 2018 suggest four strong influences on Kant's ethics
 pehla luutherwaad panth pitism he jisaki sadsyta kaant ke mata pita ne lee thi
 Pietism gave more importance to honesty and moral life than to unauthorized opinion, and concern more than rationality to feelings
 kaant kaa vishwaas tha kii tarksangatta aavashyak he parantu yah naitikta tathaa shubh sankalp se sambandhit honi chahie
 The second political philosopher is jean-jacques Rousseau whose creation of the Social Covenant influenced Kant's view on the fundamental values of humans
 posman ne kaant kii naitikta ko prabhavit karne me samakaleen naitik bahes ko ullekh kiya he
 Kant favored rationality over empiricism, which meant he saw morality as knowledge rather than being based on human desires
 posman ke anusaar- practik vidhi or antargyaan bhi kaant ke liye prabhaavshaalee the
 Kant's biographer Manfred Kuhn suggested that Kant's parents' hard work, honesty, poignancy and self-determination set an example for him and influenced him more than Pietism
 stenford inacychlopedia of philosophy main maaikel rohalf ne suzav diya ki kaant apane shikshak martin nutjan se prabhavit the jinhone kaant kaa parichay angrej bhautik vigyaani ijak newton ke kaam se karaayaa tha tathaa jo swany chrischian woolf or jon lock se prabhavit the
 The German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has proposed the principle of discourse ethics and argues that it is a child of the Kanti ethics
 unhone prastaavit kiya ki kaarywahi usame shaamil logo ke madhya sanchaar par aadhaarit hone chahie jisame ki kisi prakaar ki jabardastee yaa dhokhebaazi ko asweekaar kar unke hito or iraade par charchaa ki jaye taaki vah sabhi ke dwaara samajha ja sake
 Habermas believes that covenant between the parties is of the utmost importance to reach a moral judgment, like morality discourse morality is a knowing moral principle in which it is believed that truth and falsity can be held responsible for moral propositions
 yah ek niyam or prastaavit karata he ki naitik kaaryo ko saarvbhaumik hona chahie jisase naitik kriyaao kaa nirdhaaran or prastaavan kiya ja sake jo ki kaant ki naitikta ke hi saamaan he
 Habermas argues that his moral theory is an improved form of Kant's morality
 inhone kaant kii naitikta ke dwaitvaadi dhaanche ko khaarij kiya he
 Kant has distinguished the seeming world, which can be felt and felt by humans, and the spiritual world where it is not possible for humans to reach
 yah dvibhajan kaant ke liya aavashyak tha kyoki yah maanav kartao kii swytta kii vyakhya kar saktaa he yadhpi manushya pratiyaman sansar se bandhe he unke kaary bodhgamye duniya main mukt he
 According to Habermas, morality arises from dialogue which is rational and necessary rather than their freedom
 rajnatik darshanik jon rals kaa saamaajik sanvida kaa siddhant evam unki rachana nyaay kaa siddhant kaa vikaas, kaant kii naitikta se prabhavit tha
 Rawls argued that a just society would have to be honest to achieve its justice
 unhone samaaj ke astitv se pehle kalpit aavashyaktaao ko mahatva diya jinako samaaj ne suvyavasthit kiya yah mul sthiti he| ise agyaan ke parade kaa sthaan lenaa chahie, jahaan ki koi bhi samaaj main apane sthiti nahin janata vahaan logo ko apane hito ke prati jhukaav tha behatar parinaam praapt karne se roka jaayegaa
 The rest of Rawls' judicial theory believes that a person is independent, equal, and moral
 He considered all human beings to have some degree of rationality and intelligence that they saw as a component of morality and described their officers as officers of equal justice
 rolls ne kaant ke dwaitvaad ko adhikanshta khaarij kiya or tark kiya ki ek baar punah nirmaan ke baad kanti nitishastr iske bina bhi purna he unhone ise nyaay ke siddhant ke lakshyo me se ek ke rup me varnit kiya
 French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan linked psychoanalysis to Kanti ethics by works on ethics of psychoanalysis and Kant avik sade and Kant's comparison with Marquis de Sade
 lekan ne tark diya ki sade kaa anandatirekh kaa siddhant yon sukh kaa anugaman naitik rup se kaant ke mandandon dwaara sweekaarya he kyoki yah saarvbhaumik ho saktaa he
 He proposed that Kant saw human freedom as important to moral norms, while Sade further argued that human freedom can only be fully realized by the principle of anarchy
 onera o'nil harvard vishvavidhyalay me jon rals ke adheen adhyayanrat rahi ek aadhunik kanti nitishastri he jo ki saamaajik nyaay muddon ke liye kanti drishtikon kaa samarthan karti he
 o'neill argues that a successful Kanti interpretation of social justice should not rely on any unfounded idealization or recognition
 unhone dhyaan diya ki darshinicon ne pehle kaant dwaara maanvo ko swaayat praaniyon, bina kisi saamaajik sandarbh or or jivan lakshyon ke adarsh rup me prastut karne par un par aarope lagaaye he
 However, she says that Kant's morality can be read even without this idealization
 o' nil ne har har manushyo se jude siddhanto ke bajaaye karno kaa vyavhaarik or manushyo dwaara upyog kiye jane ki kaant kii avadharna ko variyata di he
 Kant's hypothesis is a means of decision making which means that only one idea is capable of stopping the principles we have adopted, whether this principle can be adopted by all humans
 agar hamaari ichha yah nahi he ki yah vishisht siddhant sabhi ke dwaara apanaaya jaye to ham unhen ise apnaane ke liye kaaran nahi de sakate
 We have to reject a principle that cannot be universally adopted, to use reason and reason with other people
 is prakaar maanvi swytta ke adarshavaadi drishtikon ko apanaaye bina kaant ke saarvbhaumikta ke sutrikaran tak pahunchi
 This system of universalism does not require that we all adopt universal principles, but only to prevent ourselves from adopting the principles that we do not want others to adopt
 kanti naitikta ke is adarsh se o'nil ne nyaay ke siddhant ko viksit karnaa shuru karti he
 She argues that the rejection of certain theories such as deception and coercion provides a starting point for basic assumptions, which she argues may be too demanding for humans to be more determined, the principle of equality or liberty
 There are many functions and institutions that believe in non-universal principles such as tyranny
 darshanik maaikel stoker ne apane shodh patr aadhunik naitik siddhanto kaa manobhaajan me kanti naitikta ko yah tark dekar chunauti di he kii kartavyo se kiye gayi kaary me spasht naitikta kii kami he
 He cites the example of Smith who goes to visit his friend in the hospital because of his duty and not because of friendship, he argues that there is some moral deficiency in this journey because it is motivated by wrong message
 marsia bairan ne is tathy par kanti naitikta kaa samarthan karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 After presenting several reasons, we find that it is objectionable to work out of duties
 He argued that problems only arise when people misunderstand what their duty is
 kartavyo se baahar kaary karnaa aantarik rup se galat nahi he par aniatik parinaam tab utpann hote he jab jab log galat samajhate he ki vah kya karne ke liye baadhya he
 Duties should not be seen as emotionless and impersonal
 One's duty may be to develop his character or improve his personal relationships
 bairan ne aage tark diya he ki kartavyo ko dwitiyak uddeshy ke rup me dekha janaa chahie yani ki ek aisa uddeshy jo kisi paristhiti ko niyantrit or nirdhaarit karata he ki kya kiya janaa chahie
 He argued that it was seen in this way that duty neither exhibits a lack of natural inclination in one's work nor attenuates the motives and feelings which are necessary for friendship
 bairan ke liye kartavyo dwaara shasit hone kaa matlab yah nahi he ki karttavya ke vichaar hameshaa kaary ke maardarshak hote he
 a responsible moral agent should be interested in moral questions such as questions of character
 inhe naitik kartta ko kartavya se kaary karne ke liye maargdarshit karnaa chahie
 The German philosopher GWF Hagel has presented two major criticisms of Kanti morality
 unhone pehla tark diya ki kanti nitishastra logo ko kya karnaa chaiye is bare me koi vishisht jaankaree pradaan nahi karata kyoki kaant kaa naitik niyam puri tarah se gaiyr virodhabhasi siddhant he
 He argued that Kant lacks elements in morality, so it cannot become the supreme principle of morality
 is bindu ko spost karne ke liye hegal or unke anuyaayio ne kai prashno ko prastut kiya jiname saarvbhaumik kanoon kaa siddhant yaa sahi uttar nahi detaa yaa to spasht rup se galat jabaab detaa he
 Hegel has made every argument, using Kant's example of relying on the wealth of other individuals, that Kant's theory of universality cannot determine whether a social system of property is a morally justified idea because each The answer may apply contradictions
 unhone garibo ki madad karne ke udhaaharan kaa bhi upyog kiya- yadi sabhi ne garibo ki madad kii madad karne ke liye koi garib baaki nahi rah jaayegaa isliye upakaarita saarvbhaumik hone par asambhav ho jaaegi jo kaant ke model ke anusaar ise aniatik bana detii he
 Hegel's second criticism was that Kant's morality forces humans to have an internal conflict between reason and desire
 hegal ke anusaar apni kaamnaayo ko dabaanaa or ise karno ke adhinsth karnaa manushyo ke liye aswabhaavik he
 This means that without addressing the tension between self-interest and morality, Kant's morality cannot give a man any reason to be moral
 german darshanik arthur shopenhavar ne kaant kii dharna kii aalochana kii aalochana karte hui kaha he kii naitikta ko chintaa kerani chahie ki ki aavashyak rup se kiya janaa chahie
 He insists that what the scale of morality really is is an attempt to understand and explain it, while Kant presents an idealized version of what should be done in an ideal world
 shopenhaur ne tark diya ki naitikta ko vyavhaarik hona chahie or un nishkarsho par pahuchanaa chahie jo vaastavik duniya main kaam kar sake evam is rup main prastut ho ki vah duniya ki samasyayo kaa samaadhaan karne main sakasham ho
 Schopenhauer was equally attracted by aesthetics, arguing that in both cases the prescriptive rule was not the most important part of discipline because he believed that virtues could not be taught
 ek vyakti yaa to sadaachari hoga yaa nahin
 Instead of presenting unattainable universal law, it will be molded into a specific state of morality that will guide and control the behavior of people
 darshanik fredrick nitshe ne isai or kanti nitishastr par vishesh dhyaan dene ke saath sabhi samakaleen naitik pranaaliyon kii aalochana kii
 He argued that all modern moral systems share two problematic features
 First, they make spiritual claims about the nature of humanity that must be accepted as essential to the system, which has a normative power
 or doosraa yah vyavastha aksar dusro ke upar kuch logo ke hito ko laabh detii he yadhpi nitshe kii praarambhik aapatti yah nahin he kii maanavtaa ke bare main aadhyatmik daawey asamarthaneey he unke do mukhya lakshya kantiwad or isaiyat jo aadhyatmik naitik daavon ko karte he isliye nitshe kii aalochana main pramukh rup se pradarshit hote he
 Nietzsche rejects the fundamental components of Kant's morality, in particular his argument that moral, God, and immorality can be shown through reason
 nitshe ne naitik antargyaan ke upyog par andeh daalaa jise kii jise kii kaant ne apni naitikta kii neenv ke rup main istemaal kiya he unhone tark diya kii iskaa naitikta me koi maanak bal nahin he
 He has additionally attempted to undermine important concepts of Kant's moral psychology such as resolve and pure reason
 kaant kii tarah nitshe ne swayatta kii avadharna ko viksit kiya he halaaki unhone kaant ke is vichaar ko kaarij kar diya kii hamaari swytta kaa moolyankan karne ke liye hame dusro kii swytta kaa sammaan karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 Nietzsche's moral psychology naturalist study is the opposite of Devi Kant's concept of desire and reason
 kanti dhaanche ke tahat kaaran ichha ke liye moulik rup se alag uddeshy he kyoki isamen paristhitiyon ke peeche khadey rahane tathaa swatantra nirnay lene kii kshamta hoti he
 Nietzsche himself revealed the idea of different motivations and trends in our social structure
 is prakaar jab aisa prathit hota he kii hamaari budhdi ne hamari vaasana ke viruddh nirnay liye he to vastav me yah hamaari vaikalpik vaasana hoti he do duusari ke upar prabhaav jamaa leti he
 This is directly opposite to Kant's concept of instinct in opposition to intellect, rather than just another instinct
 is prakaar yah paristhitiyon ke peeche khadey rahane or nirnay lene me sakasham nahin he
 The decision can be determined by the most powerful wish of its own
 kanti samalochako ne tark diya he kii nitshe ke vyavhaarik darshan ko kanti bhaavana ke peeche khadey rahane ke liye swany sakasham astitv kii aavashyaktaa he ek vyakti apane liye swany mulya banataa he jo kii nitshe ke darshan kaa mukhya vichaar he
 He should be able to understand himself as a unified subject
 yahan tak kii yadi karta apni kaamana se prabhavit hota he to use unhen swany ke rup me hi maananaa chahie jo kii swytta kii nitshe kii avadharana ko kamjor karti he
 Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill has criticized Kant for not justifying moral rules by moral intuition, which is based on utilitarian theory
 mil ne tark diya kii kaant kii naitikta yah vyakhya nahin karti kii kuch kriyaaye upyogetavaad kii chintakarshan kiye bina galat kyon he
 On the basis of morality, Mill believed that his theory of utilitarianism is a strong basis of intuition rather than a belief in the causes of Kant and it can better explain why some actions are right or wrong
 gun nitishastra naitik siddhant kaa ek rup he jo kii vishisht kaaryo kii apeksha karta ke charitra par jor detaa he
 Many of its supporters have criticized Kant's duty-oriented scientific approach to ethics
 elizaveth ascomb ne kanoono ke liye unke junun or daayitv ke liye kantiyanatikta sahit aadhunik naitiktao kii aalochana kii he saath hi unhone tark kiya he kii saarvbhaumik naitik siddhant par bharosa karne vaale kanoon bahut kathor he
 Anscomb suggested that because moral law is inherent in the making of moral laws, it is therefore irrelevant in modern secular society
 alasdare macintir ne apni rachana guno ke baad me kaant kii saarvbhaumikta ke sutrikaran, ke aalochana karte hue tark diya he ki vibhinn tuchha or aniatik siddhant isaki pariksha me safal ho sakate he jaise ki apane puure jivan me sabhi vaado ko puraa karnaa sivaae ek ko chhodkar
 He additionally challenged Kant's formulation of humanity as 'humanity as his purpose' and said that Kant did not give any reason for not treating others as a means
 yah siddhant ki mujhe chhodkar sabhi ko ek saadhan ke rup me maananaa yadhpi kadaachit aniatik he par saarvbhaumik ho saktaa he
 Benard Williams argues that Kant misrepresents humans and morality by governing the character of humans
 philip foot ne vishleshnatmak darshan dwaara gun kii upeksha ke liye jimmedaar darshanico ke ek samooh main se ek ke rup me kaant kii pahchaan kii he
 Roman Catholic clergyman Sarvar Pinkers considered Christian morality closer to Aristotle's morality than to Kant's morality
 unhone gun nitishastra ko 'utkrushtataa ke liye swatantraaa' ke rup me prastut kiya jisaki manyata he kisi ke gun ko viksit karne ke liye swatantraaa prakruti ke anusaar kaary karti he
 Initially, the following rules are required for this, but the intention is that the doer should develop goodness and work happily
 yah upeksha ke swatantraaa ke vipareet he jiskaa sambandh pinkers ne wiliam okkham ke saath bataaya tha tathaa kaant ke saath tulana kii
 According to this idea, freedom is established against nature, free actions are those which are not determined by obsession or feelings
 kisi karta ke gun main vikaas yaa pragati nahin hoti keval aadat kaa nirmaan hota he
 This is closer to Kant's moral approach because Kant's notion of autonomy requires that the doers are not guided only by their emotions and it contrasts with Pinkers' conception of Christian morality
 
 Many philosopher Jean Bethke Ailshtein Sarvas Pinkers, Iris Murdoch, and the Catholic Synod, including Elizaveth Enscomb, have all suggested that Kant's moral conception based on autonomy is contradictory to its dual claim that human morality is a co-legislator and morality is a priority
 ve tark karte he ki agar kuch saarvbhaumik rup se praathmik he to yah manushyo par nirbhar nahin ho saktaa he jo ki sadaa se astitv me nahin rahe he
 On the other hand, if humans actually create morality, then they are not bound by it in a fair sense because they are always free to change it
 yah aapatti kaant ke vichaaro ko lekar galat fahmi par adhrith prathit he kyoki kaant ne tark diya kii naitikta ek tarksangat sankalp kii avadharna par nirbhar he
 It is not based on the specific contingent desire of any creature nor on specific human desires, so it does not mean that Kant has described morality as dependent on something which does not exist forever, apart from the sense in which our will is the law
 It is right if our desire is rational, so we have to make the wish according to the law, that is, the will according to moral ethical decisions The same should apply to all rational beings, including ourselves

 That is, according to Kant, a self-determination is not the only one which fulfills one's own desires but which is a valid resolution, that is, which conforms to the principle of universality and which Kant has identified with reason
 vidmbana se ek duusare prachlan main aparivartaneey vichaar ke anusaar sankalp hoobahoo us prakaar kii shakti he jisko elshaten ne unki naitik adhikarita ke aadhaar par ishwar se sambandhit kiya he, or vah ise devi aadesh siddhant ke ek nune swachhik praaroop par ise ajna detii he jo kii naitikta or ishwariya ichha donon ko aakasmik bana degaa
 Kant's theory is a variant of the first rather than a second view of autonomy, so neither God nor any human authority, including the human institution of God, plays any specific authentic role in its moral doctrine
 kaant or elshaten donon is vichaar se sahamat he kii ishwar ke paas apni ichha ke anuroop niyam banane ke liye karano ke aparivartaneey tathy, naitik satya sahit ke atirikt kii anya vikalp nahin he
 Humans have such a choice but in different ways their relationship with morality is the same as that of God; They can recognize moral facts but do not determine their consent through accidental acts of will
 kaant kaa vishwaas tha manushyo main kaaran ke prati sahabhaagi hone kii kshamta naitikta kaa aadhaar honi chahie or yahi wo kshamta he jo manushyo ko naitik rup se mahatvapurn banaati he isliye unka maananaa tha kii sabhi manushya ko samaan garima or sammaan kaa adhikari hona chahie
 Margaret Eaton argues that ethically a medical professional should be happy to use his own business on someone else, even when he is a patient himself
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek shodhakarta jo rogiyon par bina unki jaanakri ke pareekshan karne kii kaamana rakhata he aisa karne par sabhi shodhakartaaon ke liye prasann hona chahie
 He argues that Kant's need for autonomy would mean that a patient should be able to make 'fully informed decisions' regarding treatment, testing it on unaware patients makes it unethical
 Medical research should be motivated by respect for patients
 isliye unhen sabhi tathyon ke bare me suchit kiya janaa chahie tab bhi jab ki rogi ko nivarak salaah di jaye
 Jeremy Sugarman has argued that Kant's formulation of autonomy requires that patients should not only be used for the benefit of society but should always be treated as a rational being with their goals
 haaron hinckley vyakhya karte he ki kanti spostikaran ki aavashyaktaa he ki un vikalpon kaa sammaan karnaa jin par tarksangita ke saath pahunche ho naa ki vah vikalp jin par moorkhtapurna yaa ayuktiyukt madhyamon se pahunche ho| unka tark he ki isame kuch bhinnata he ki ek purnatah tarksangat karta kya chunaav karegaa or vastav main ek rogi kya chunata he yah bhinnata ek ayuktiyukt vyaktigat vishistataa ke parinaam swarup utpann hoti he
 Although a orthodox physician should not lie or force the patient, Hinckley suggests that some forms of paternalism such as suppressing information that may induce non-rational responses may be acceptable
 susaan fellman ne apni rachana 'kaise garbhavastha or garbhpaat kaa upachaar kanti naitikta dwaara karnaa chahie ' me tark kiya he ki kanti nitishastra ke anusaar garbhpaat kaa bachaav kiya janaa chahie
 He proposed that a woman should be regarded as a respected autonomous person who has complete control over the body, as Kant suggested
 unka maananaa he ki kaant ki naitikta me mahilaon kaa swatantra chunaav pradhantham hoga, garbhpaat kaa nirnay maan ki aavashyaktaa he
 Dean Herriss noted that if abortion is to be used in the discussion of abortion, it should be decided whether the fetus is an autonomous person
 kanti nitishastri karl kohen kaa tark he ki aam or tarksangat prajatiyo me tarksangatta yaa sahabhagita hone ki kshamta manushyo or jad vastuo yaa tarkahin jeevadhario ke madhya praasangik bhed he
 Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational due to age or mental disability, actors are obliged to treat them as they wish for themselves, which is equivalent to rational adults such as mother's Who wishes to have an abortion
 kaant ne manushyo ko aatm-rakshan,nasl-rakshan,aannad-rakshan ki pashavik ichhaao ke adheen mana
 He argued that it is the duty of human beings to keep away from issues including suicide, sexual assault, drunkenness, which harm or cause self-harm
 isane kaant ko yon sambhog ko apmanjanak manane ke liye prerit kiya kyoki yah manushyo ko annad ki vastu me badal detaa he
 He only accepted sex within marriage, which he regarded as "animal husband only"
 unka maananaa tha ki hastmaithun aatmahatya se bhi badtar he jo ki manushya kaa str pashu se bhi niche gira detaa he unhone tark diya ki balaatkaar kaa dand punsatvaharan or pashugaman kaa dand samaaj se bahishkrut hona chaiye| nariwadi darshanik catherine mckinnan ne tark diya ki kai samakaleen prathao ko kaant ke maanako se aniatik samajha jaayegaa kyoki ve mahilao kaa ammaanusikaran karti he
 On sexual harassment and prostitution, she argues that it makes women karmic and does not meet Kant's standards of human autonomy
 Commercial sex has been criticized for turning both sides into objects
 parsparik sahmati samasyagrast he kyoki sahmati main log swany ko karm bishyak banaate he
 Alan Soble has noted that more liberal Kanti ethics believe that women's consent can vindicate their participation in rhetoric and prostitution, based on other relevant reasons
 kyoki ek naitik rogi hone ke aadhaar par kaant ne tarksangatta dekhi-ek naitik vichaar ke kaaran unka maananaa tha ki jaanavaro ke paas koi naitik adhikaar nahin he
 According to Kant, the animal is not rational, on the basis that no one can behave immorally towards them
 halaaki unhone isamen vishwaas nahin kiya ki hamaare jaanavaro ke prati koi koi kartavya he, kaant ne vishwaas kiya ki jaanavaro ke prati krur hona galat he kyoki hamaara vyavhaar manushyo ke prati hamaare najariye ko prabhvit kar saktaa he
 If we get into harming animals, then it is more likely that we should make it acceptable to see humans being harmed
 nitishastri tom regan ne teen pramukh binduo ke aadhaar par kaant kaa jaanavaro kaa naitik muulyankan ko asweekrut kar diya,pehla unhone kaant kaa daawa asweekaar kiya ki jaanavar aatm-jaagruk nahin he
 He then challenged Kant's claim that animals have no intrinsic moral value because they cannot make moral decisions
 regan ne tark diya ki yadi naitik mulio kaa nirdhaaran nirnay lene ki kshamta se hota he to hame wo manushyo jo ki naitik vichaar karne main asamarth he,ko saamaan rup se anaavashyak naitik kaaran maananaa chahie
 Regan eventually argues that Kant's claim that animals exist only as a means is unfounded
 The fact that animals have lives that can pass well or badly suggests that they, like humans, have their own objectives
 Occur
 kaant kaa maananaa tha ki nirapavaad kartavyadesh hame siddhant pradaan karte he ki hame kisi bhi paristhiti me jhooth nahin bolnaa chahie, bhale hi ham achche parinamo ko laane kaa prayaas kar rahe ho, jaise kisi hatyare se jhooth bolnaa taaki wo apane icchit shikaar ko dhudhane se paraavritt ho sake
 Kant argued that we do not know fully what the consequences of an action would be, the result could be unexpectedly harmful
 isliye hame gyaat galat 'jhooth' se bachane kaa kaary karnaa chahie bajaay ki ek sambhavit galat se bachane ke
 If harmful consequences arise then we are innocent because we have acted according to our duties
 julia driver tark karti he ki yadi hamane apane siddhanto ko bhinn prakaar se sutrit kar chunate he to shaayad hi koi samasya utpann ho yah siddhant 'mai nirdosh kaa jivan bachaane ke liye jhooth boluungaa' saarvbhaumik ho saktaa he
 However, this new theory can still see the murderer as a means to save us from doing so
 is prakaar hame ab bhi kaant ke udhaaharan me hatyare ko sach bataane ki aavashyaktaa ho sakati he

 Based on this ratio, some Egyptologists believe that the builders of the pyramids had knowledge of π and deliberately built pyramids incorporating the properties of the circle

 In combination with steroid-free anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid analgesics, paracetamol is also used in the treatment of more severe pain
 opioid analgesic Although it is generally considered safe for human use in prescribed doses, doses higher than the prescribed amount of paracetamol can cause fatal liver damage, a normal dose in a person can be similarly harmful; This risk increases with consumption of alcohol

 Both the terms acetaminophen and paracetamol are derived from the chemical name of the same compound, which is the compound: pera-aceta ilaminophino l and pera-aceta ilami nofinol In some contexts, it is simply called APAP, abbreviated as N-acetyl
 -para is for aminophenol
 acetanilide pehla anilin vyutpann tha jisamen analgesic or antipyretic gun the or yah 1886 main bahut jaldi e
 kaahan or pi
 hep ke dwaara antifabrin ke naam se medical practice main aa gaya
 But its unacceptable toxic effects, particularly due to the risk of cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia, emphasized the discovery of a less toxic aniline derivative
 1877 main johns hopakins vishvavidhyalay main hormone northrope morse glacial acetic amla main tin ke saath "pi"-nitro phenol ke apchayan ke madhyam se pehle se hi peracetamol kaa sanshleshan kar chuke the
 But for the first time in 1887, the clinical pharmacologist Joseph von Mering tested paracetamol on patients
 1893 main, won mering ne ek patr prakashit kiya jisamen phenacetin or anya anilin vyutpann ke saath peracetamol ke naidanik parinaamon par report di gayi
 Von Mering claimed that, unlike phenacetin, paracetamol has a slight tendency to produce methemoglobinemia
 peracetamol ko jaldi hi phenacetin ke paksh main hataa diya gaya
 The sale of phenacetin established Bayer as a leading pharmaceutical company
 phenacetin par aspirin aanshik rup se baari thi, phenacetin 1899 main hinarich dreser ke dwaara aushadhi main aayi, phenacetin kai dashakon ke liye lokapriy rahi, vishesh rup se counter par beche jane vaale "sar dard ke mishran" jinka vyapak rup se vigyaapan kiya jaataa tha, main aam taur par phenacetin, ek aminopyrine vyutpann yaa aspirin, keffine or kabhi kabhi ek barbiturat hota tha
 Von Mering's claim could not be challenged for half a century when two teams of researchers from the United States analyzed the metabolisms of acetanilide and paracetamol
 1947 main david lester or leone greenberg ne is baat ke prabal pramaan praapt kiye ki peracetamol maanav ke rakt main acetanilide kaa ek mukhya metabolismak he or baad ke ek adhyayan main unhone report di ki albino chuhon ko peracetamol kii badi khuraaq dene par bhi methemoglobinemia utpann nahin hua
 In three papers published in the September 1948 issue of the Journal of Firmology and Experimental Therapeutics, Bernard Brodie Bernard Brody, Julius Axelrod Julius Axelrod and Frederick Flinn used more specific methods to ensure that paracetamol is the main metabolizer of acetanilide in human blood and It reported that it is an efficacious analgesic like its foregoing
 unhone yah bhi suzav diya ki methemoglobinemia kaa maanav main utpaadan mukhya rup se ek anya metabolismak phenlhydroxilemin ke dwaara hota he
 Subsequently in 1949, a letter by Brody and Axelrod stated that phenacetin also produces paracetamol via metabolism
 isse "ek baar phir peracetamol kii khoj" hui
 yah suzav diya gaya ki peracetamol kaa 4 -aminophenol se sankraman, ek padaarth jisase ise won mering ke dwaara sanshlisht kiya gaya, uske galat nishkarshon kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Paracetamol was first marketed in the United States in 1953 by the sterling-winthorp Company, which outperformed aspirin because it could be safely given to children and people with ulcers

 In 1956, 500 mg tablets of paracetamol began to be sold in the United Nations under the trade name Penadol, made by Friedrich Sterns and Company, a subsidiary of Sterling Drug Inc

 In 1963, paracetamol became associated with British Pharmacopoeia and has since gained popularity as an analgesic factor with little side effects and very few reactions with other pharmaceutical factors

 In North America, paracetamol is sold commonly or by a trade name, for example tylenol, anacin-3, tempra, and detril
 Although brand-name paracetamol is available in the UK, non-brand common paracetamol is also commonly sold
 europe main, peracetamol ke sabase aam brands hai afferalgan or dolipren The most popular brand in Bangladesh is Napa which is manufactured by Beximco Pharma
 kuch sanyojanon main peracetamol opioidcodin ke saath hoti he, jise kabhi kabhi ko-kodamol kaha jaataa he
 In the United States and Canada, it is marketed under the name Tylenol # 1 / 2 / 3 / 4, which contains 8–10 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg codeine, respectively
 america main, yah sangyojan keval doctor kii salaah par hi miltaa he, jabaki sabase kam kshamta kaa sangyojan canada main counter par mil jaataa he or anya deshon main, anya kshamtaayen bhi counter par uplabdh ho sakati hai
 Common forms of these combinations are also available
 britain or kai anya deshon main, is sangyojan kaa vipanan tylex CD or penadeen ke naam se kiya jaataa he
 Other names are captin, dysprol, dimadone, phenam, Hedex, mexalene, nofedol, paralene, pediapirin, perfalgan, and solpadine
 Paracetamol is also combined with other opioids, such as dihydrocodeine, known as co-diadramol, oxycodone, or hydrocodone, and is marketed in the US as Percocet and Vicodin, respectively
 ek or bahut saamaanya rup se prayukt kiye jane vaale analgesic sangyojan main peracetamol ke saath propoxiphine nepcilette paaya jaataa he, jise darwoket naamak brands se bechaa jaataa he
 Paracetamol, a combination of codeine and the calamative doxylemin succinate, is sold under the name Syndol or Marsindol
 peracetamol kaa upyog migraine ke sirdard ke liye bahu ghatakon ke sangyojan ko banane ke liye kiya jaataa he, praroopik rup se isamen butalbital or peracetamol keffine ke saath aay keffine ke bina hote hai or kabhi kabhi isamen kodin bhi ho saktaa he
 Paracetamol is generally classified with non-steroidal regression medications, but is not considered one
 is varg kii sabhi dawaaon kii tarah, isaki mukhya kriya pranali cychlooxijinej kaa sandman he, yah ek anzime he jo prostaglandins ke utpaadan ke liye uttaradaayi he, jo sujan, dard or bukhaar ke mukhya madhyasth hai
 Therefore, all nsaids have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic properties
 prayek NSAID dawa kii vishisht abhikriya unke aushadhiy gunon, vitaran or metabolizam par nirbhar karti he
 While paracetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties compared to aspirin, it is unsuccessful in acting on anti-inflammatory actions, as paracetamol is sensitive to the high levels of paracicides present in inflammatory lesions
 baharhaal, jis karypranali se peracetamol bukhaar ore dard ko kam karti he, abhi bhi vyapak rup se ek bahes kaa vishay he kyonki peracetamol prostaglandins ke utpaadan ko kam karti he
 Aspirin also inhibits the production of prostaglandins, but in contrast to paracetamol it has a reduced anti-inflammatory action
 isi tarah, aspirin purv-skandan rasayan thromboksen ke utpaadan ko sandamit karti he, jabaki peracetamol aisa nahin karti he
 Aspirin is known to inhibit the cyclooxygenase class of enzymes and due to the partial similarity of paracetamol with aspirin action, there is more research on whether paracetamol also inhibits COX
 It is now clear that paracetamol acts through at least two pathways
 anzimon kaa COX varg ek asthaayee anu, prostaglendin H2 ke liye aracidonic amla ke metabolizam ke uttaradaayi he, yah anu asankhya anya purv shoth yogicon main badal jaataa he
 Classical anti-inflammatory, such as nsaids, block this position
 keval tabhi jab upyukt rup se oxikrut COX anzime bahut adhik sakriy hota he
 Paracetamol reduces the oxidized form of the COX enzyme, thus preventing it from forming pre-inflammatory chemicals
 
 is prakaar CNS main prostaglandin E2 kii maatra ko kam karke taap niamak centre main hypothelemus ke nirdhaarit bindu ko kam kar detaa he
 Inhibition of another enzyme COX3 is particularly affected in the case of paracetamol
 COX3 ko CNS anuchhed paath ke baahar nahin dekha gaya he
 Paracetamol also regulates the endogenous cannabinoid system
 peracetamol metabolizam ke dwaara AM404 banaati he, is yogic kii kai kriyaayein hai; sabase mahatvapurn he yah neuron ke dwaara antarjaat kenabinoid / veniloid enandamide ko sandamit karata he
 Which leads to activation of TRPV1, the main pain receptor of the body
 iske alaava, AM404 sodium channel kaa sandman karata he, jaisaa ki nishchetak lidoken or prokene karte hai
 It has been found that either of these actions reduces pain and may be a possible action mechanism of paracetamol, although it has been demonstrated that paracetamol analgesics, by inhibiting the cannabinoid receptor and inhibiting any activity of cannabinoids Loses the effect, it is said that its pain relieving action is mediated by the endogenous cannabinoid system
 ek siddhant ke anusaar peracetamol anzimon ke COX varg ke COX -3 isoform ko sandamit karne ke dwaara kaary karti he
 This enzyme, when acting in dogs, exhibits considerable similarity to other COX enzymes, forming pre-inflammatory chemicals and selectively inhibited by paracetamol
 haalanki, kuch shodh bataate hai ki manushyon or chuhon main, COX-3 anzime shoth kriya ke bina hota he
 Another possibility is that paracetamol inhibits cyclooxygenase, but it occurs in an environment of inflammation, where the concentration of peroxidase is high, the higher the oxidation state of paracetamol that inhibits its action
 iskaa arth yah hua ki peracetamol kaa shoth ke sthaan par koi pratyaksh prabhaav nahin hota he, lekin iske bajaay yah CNS main kaary karke taap aadi ko kam karata he jahaan vaataavaran oxikari nahin hota he
 The exact mechanism by which paracetamol is believed to affect COX-3 is disputed
 peracetamol kaa metabolizam prarambh main yakrut main hota he, jisase avishakt utpaada banate hai
 Three metabolic pathways are notable: hipetic cytochrome P450 anzime pranali peracetamol kaa metabolizam karti he or ek chota lekin mahatvapurn elkylicari metabolismak NAPQI banaati he
 NAPQI is now reversibly conjugated to the sulfhydryl group of glutathione
 in teenon margon se jo antim utpaada praapt hote hai, ve niskriy, avishakt hote hai or ant main vrikkon ke dwaara utsarjit kar die jate hai
 In the third pathway, however, the mediator product NAPQI is toxic
 NAPQI praathmik rup se peracetamol ke vifaille prabhaav ke liye uttaradaayi he; yah vishikaran kaa ek utkrisht udhaaharan he
 NAPQI is produced primarily by the two isoenzymes of cytochrome P450: CYP2E1 and CYP1A2
 However the P450 gene is highly polymorphic and individual differences in paracetamol toxicity are thought to be due to the third isoenzyme CYP2D6
 CYP2D6 main anuvanshik bahurupata NAPQI ke utpaadan kii kaaphi alag daron main yogadan kar sakati he
 In addition, individuals can be classified as "extensive", "ultrarapid" and "poor" metabolizers based on their CYP2D6 expression levels
 However, CYP2D6 is less of a metabolite of paracetamol than other P450 enzymes
 Makes NAPQI, its action contributes to the toxicity of paracetamol in extensive and ultrarapid metabolizers, when very high doses of paracetamol are taken
 saamaanya khuraaq lene par, NAPQI sanyugman ke dwaara jaldi hi nirvishikrut ho jaataa he
 After a high dose and possibly even in extensitive and ultrarapid metabolizers, this detoxification pathway becomes saturated and eventually NAPQI accumulates

3 °F) Paracetamol is a suitable alternative to aspirin, especially in patients with a high amount of gastric acid secretion or a prolonged bleeding time
 While paracetamol has analgesic and antipyretic properties compared to aspirin, its anti-inflammatory effect is weaker
 chunki peracetamol ko aasaani se sahan kiya ja saktaa he, yah doctor ke parche ke bina bhi uplabdh ho jaati he, isse aspirin kii tarah gestric parshv prabhaav nahin hote hai, yah haal hi ke varshon main ek saamaanya gharelu dawa ban gayi he
 Unlike other common analgesics such as aspirin and ibuprofen, paracetamol has a significantly lower anti-inflammatory action, so it has not been considered a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
 tulanaatmak prabhavotpaadakta ke sambandh main, nsaids ke saath tulana karne par adhyayan paraspar virdohi parinaam darshaate hai

 Researchers found that excessive use of aspirin or paracetamol — 300 grams per year — was associated with a condition in which the kidney became small, serrated, and calcified
 peracetamol garbhavastha main surakshit he or nsaids kii tarah bhruneey ductus artiriosus ke band hone ko prabhavit nahin karti he
 Unlike aspirin, it is safe in children, as paracetamol is not associated with the risk of Reye's syndrome in children with viral disease
 nsaids kii tarah or opioid analgesic dawaaon ke vipareet, peracetamol kisi bhi tarah se utsaah yaa mood parivartan kaa kaaran nahin maani gayi he
 In 2008, the largest study of the long-term side effects of paracetamol in children was published in The Lancet
 31 deshon main 200,000 se adhik bacchon par kiye adhyayan main paaya gaya ki jivan ke pehle varsh main bukhaar ke liye peracetamol kaa upyog 6-7 saal kii aayu main asthma ke lakshanon ke badhane se sambandhit he or jivan ke pehle varsh ke saath 6-7 saal kii aayu main bhi peracetamol kaa upyog rhinokanjakativitis or eczema ke badhane se sambandhit he
 The authors acknowledge that their "discoveries can only be derived from indications", for example this relationship may not be common, but may also be caused by the disease being treated with paracetamol, and also stated that Further research is required in the subject
