 rajendra krishi vishvavidhyalay, bharat ke bihar rajya ke samastipur jile ke pusa bazaar ke nikat sthit he
 It is one of the 26 agricultural universities in India
 july 2014 main ise kendriya vishvavidhyalay banane kaa nirnay hua
 Originally, this institute was the 'imperial Agricultural Research Institute' which was established in the British era in 1903
 san 1934 main bihar main ek bhayankar bukamp aayaa jisamen is santhaan ke mukhya bhawanon ko kaaphi kshati hui
 As a result, the same year the institute was shifted to New Delhi, which was called 'pusa Camps'
 aage chalakar dilli sthit yah santhaan kaa naam bhartiya krishi anusandhan santhaan kar diya gaya or pusa main jo kuch bachaa rahaa use padaavnat karke 'krishi anusandhan stesan' kaha jane laga
 Finally, on 3 December 1970, the Government of India named it and changed it to 'rajendra Agricultural University'
 is vishvavidhyalay main paanch sankaay hai - krishi, pashuchikitsa, krishi ejiniyari, moolbhoot vigyaan tathaa manviki evam grih vigyaan
 Apart from this, there are agricultural colleges, fisheries colleges and milk technology colleges
 yah vishvavidhyalay 6 purv-snaatak paathyakram, 33 para-snaatak kaarykram tathaa 18 piechdi kaarykram sanchalit karata he
 It is the only university in India that offers an MBA degree in agri-business
 antarrashtriya sambandh vibhinn deshon ke bich sambandhon kaa adhyayan he, saath hi saath samprabhu rajyon, antar-sarkari sanghathanon, antarrashtriya gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon, gaiyr-sarkari sanghathanon or bahurashtriya companiyon kii bhoomika kaa bhi adhyayan he
 International relations is also sometimes referred to as 'international study'), although the two terms are not entirely synonymous
 saadhaaran shabdon main 'antarrashtriya raajnneeti' kaa arth he 'rajyon ke madhya raajnneeti karnaa'
 If we study the meaning of 'politics' three major elements emerge - the existence of groups; Consent between groups; And fulfill their interests by groups
 is aashay ko yadi antarrashtriya str par akalan karen to ye teen tatv mukhya rup se - rajyon kaa astitv; rajyon ke bich sangharsh; tathaa apane rashtrahiton kii purti hetu shakti kaa prayog
 Therefore, international politics is to study the actions under which states struggle on the basis of power to fulfill their national interests
 is sandarbh main rashtriya hit antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke pramukh lakshya hote hai; sangharsh iskaa disha nirdesh tay karti he; tathaa shakti is uddeshy prapti kaa pramukh saadhan mana jaataa he
 But we can consider the above definition as traditional, because today 'international politics' has been replaced by the broader concept 'international relations'
 iske antargat rajyon ke paraspar sangharsh ke saath-saath sahyogaatmak pahaluon ko bhi ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke antargat adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Apart from this, apart from 'states', many other factors have now become the subject area of international politics
 atah iske antargat aaj vyakti, sanstha, sanghathan va kai anya gaiyr-rajya ikaiyaan bhi sammilit ho gai hai
 Its present base and subject area has taken a very wide form today
 in sabhi vishyon par charchaa se pehle alag-alag vidwaanon dwaara di gai nimna paribhaashaon kii samiksha karnaa ati anivaary ho jaataa he- The scope of these definitions is very limited, because basically 'states' have been considered as factors of international politics
 yah antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop tak hi simit he
 Mainly hannes j
 Margenthau, Harald Sprout, Bon Dyk, Thompson, etc
 are its main supporters, which is clear from their definitions- naveen paribhaashaon main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vyapak swaroop antarrashtriya sambandhon kii charchaa kii gai he
 In addition to the state, new factors of international politics such as international organizations, longitude groups, ngos, international institutions, some individuals etc
 have also been included
 iske atirikt isamen sangharsh ke saath-saath sahyog tathaa raajnneeti ke saath-saath pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup main ise prabhavit karne vaale arthath, saanskrithik, dharmik, saamaajik, vigyaan evam takniki aadi pahaluon kaa bhi ullekh kiya gaya he
 The following definitions of various authors reveal this meaning very clearly
 is prakaar antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop prarambh se vartmaan tak bahut vyapak ho jaataa he
 It has included the study of various world units and organizations along with nation states today
 parantu in sabhi parivartanon ke baad bhi in adhyayanon kaa kendra bindu aaj bhi raashtra rajya hi he
 Based on the above definitions, the following conclusions about the nature of international politics emerge
 atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop parivartansheel he
 Whenever the environment, factors and developments of international politics will change, changes in methods and approaches to study it are also inevitable
 iske atirikt, yah parivartan sthai na hokar nirantar he
 Along with this, it is very complex due to various factors, levels, dimensions, etc
 Therefore, a smooth, rational, comprehensive approach is required for its smooth study
 jaisaa uparyukt paribhaashaon evam swaroop se gyaat he ki antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa vishay kshetra badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Today its subject area has become quite extensive, under which the following things are studied: atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa vishay kshetra aaj bahut vyapak va jatil hone ke saath-saath vikaas kii ore agrasar he
 Under this, the study of various traditional factors as well as non-traditional factors is also becoming important
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas kaa itihaas zyada pracheen nahin he, balki yah vishay beesvin shatabdi kii upaj he
 Clearly, its history begins with the establishment of the international Woodrow Wilson Chair in Welles University in 1919
 is peeth par pratham asin hone vaale prasiddh itihaaskaar professor aloard jimrn the tathaa baad main anya pramukh viddhan jinhone is peeth ko sushobhit kiya unamem se pramukh the - si

 At the same time similar arrangements were seen in other universities and institutes
 atah pichhali ek shatabdi ke is vishay ke itihaas par drushtipaat karen to is vishay main aaye utaar-chadhaav ke saath-saath iske ek swytt vishay main sthapit hone ke bare main jaankaree milti he
 Multidimensional changes in this subject have helped to enhance, coordinate and develop the content on the one hand, and on the other hand by rendering various theories, it has helped in understanding many complex problems and aspects
 kenneth thampsan ne san 1962 ke 'rivyuu of politics' main prakashit apane lekh main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke itihaas ko chaar bhaagon main baanta he, jiske aadhaar par is vishay kaa suspasht evam sunishchit adhyayan sambhav ho saktaa he
 These four stages of development can also include the fifth phase of the post-cold War era
 inkaa vistrut varnan nimna prakaar se he- Before the First World War, only scholars of history, law, political science, philosophy etc
 considered different aspects of international politics
 mukhya rup se itihaaskaar hi iskaa adhyayan rajanyik itihaas tathaa anya deshon ke saath sambandhon ke itihaas ke rup main karte the
 Under this, there was an account of the work done by diplomats and foreign ministers
 atah ise kootnithik itihaas kii sangya bhi di jaati he
 According to EH Kar, before World War I, the relation of war was understood only to the soldiers and its equivalent international politics was related to diplomats
 iske atirikt, prajatantric deshon main bhi paramparaagat rup se videsh niti ko dalgat raajnneeti se alag rakhaa jaataa tha tathaa chune hue ang bhi apane aapako videshi mantralay par ankush rakhane main asamarth mahasoos karte the
 Prior to 1919, there were several major reasons for apathy towards the subject - First, till this time it was believed that war and alliance among states were as natural as poverty and unemployment
 atah yuddh, videsh niti evam rajyon ke madhya paraspar sambandhon ko roak paanaa maanviya samarthy ke vash se baahar mana jaataa tha
 Second, before World War I, wars were not so fierce
 tritiy, sanchaar sadhano ke abhaav main antarrashtriya raajnneeti kuch gine chune rajyon tak hi simit thi
 Thus the biggest shortcoming of the study of international politics in this era was the development of general interests
 is kaal main keval rajanyik itihaas kaa varnanaatmak adhyayan maatra hi hua
 As a result, it helped to understand neither the current nor future international politics
 is yug kii maatra uplabdhi 1919 main wales vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan ke peeth kii sthapana rahi
 In the period between the two world wars, two parallel currents developed
 jinamein se pratham ke antargat purv aitihaasikta ke prati prabhutv ko chhodkar samayik ghatnaon / samasyao ke adhyayan par adhik bal diya jane laga
 Along with this, an attempt has also been made to combine historical political studies with the current political contexts
 aitihaasik prabhaav ke kam hone ke baad bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan hetu ek samgr drushtikon kaa abhaav abhi bhi bana rahaa
 During this period, a lot of emphasis was placed on the study of the present, but the importance of the mutual relationship between the present and the past is still not recognized
 iske atirikt, na hi yudhottar raajnneetik samasyaon ko ateet kii tulaneey samasyaon ke saath rakhkar dekhne kaa prayaas hi kiya gaya
 Perhaps this is why even in this era two fundamental deficiencies were clearly revealed
 pratham, pehle charan kii hi bhaanti is kaal main bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti main saarvbhaumik siddhanth kaa vikaas nahin ho sakaa
 Second, even today the study of international politics could not become more explicit and rational
 is prakaar is charan main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan main bal dene kii sthiti main badlaav ke atirikt bahut zyada parivartan dekhne ko nahin mila tathaa na hi is vishay ke spasht rup se swatantra anushaasan banane kii pushti hui
 The third phase of the development of international politics was also a period between two world wars parallel to the second phase
 ise sudhaarwad kaa yug isliye kaha jaataa he ki isamen rajyon dwaara raashtra sangh kii sthapana ke kadhyam se antarrashtriya raajnneeti main sudhaar kii kalpana kii gai
 In this era, there was mainly institutional development
 is kaal ke vidwaanon, rajanyikon, rajanetaaon va chintakon kaa maananaa tha ki yadi antarrashtriya sansthaaon kaa vikaas ho jaataa he to vishwa samudaay ke sammukh upasthit yuddh va shanti kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan sambhav ho sakegaa
 For this purpose some legal and ethical approaches were structured which had the following main grounds
 inhen aadarshik evam naitik mulyon par bal dete hue antarrashtriya sanghathan kii pariklpana kii gai
 After its establishment, it was believed that the struggle to make peace between the states in international relations is over
 nai vyavastha ke antargat shakti santulan kaa koi sthaan nahin hoga
 Now the states will settle their disputes through the Union
 atah is yug main na keval yuddh va shaanti kii samasyaon kaa vivechan kiya, apitu iske doorgaami sudhaaron ke bare main bhi sochaa gaya
 Hence, the main points of the study were also to change the nature of international politics through legal problems and development of organizations
 antatah is kaal main bhavatmak, kalpanasheel va naitik sudhaarwad par adhik bal diya gaya he
 But there was always a question mark on the significance of these approaches between the World Wars
 raashtra sangh kii pratham ek dashak kii gatividhiyon se jahaan aashaa kii kiran dikhaai di, vahiin duusare dashak kii yarthathwaadee sthiti ne is dharna ko bilkul samaapt kar diya
 Non-cooperation and factionalism among the big powers gave rise to a power struggle system instead of establishing peace
 japan ne manchuriya par hamale karke jahaan shanti ko bhang kar diya vahiin italy, germany va rus ne bhi vivaadaaspad sthitiyon main na keval raashtra sangh kii sadsyta hi chodi, balki dwitiya vishwayuddh ke prarambh hone kii prakriya ko or teevr bana diya
 In this way, the world system could not run with peace, morality and law, then the realist approach was strengthened as an alternative approach due to writers like EH Kar, Shumbha, Quincy Right
 is charan main antarrashtriya raajnneeti main moolbhoot parivartanon se na keval isaki vishaywastu vyapak hui balki isamen bahut jatiltaayen bhi paidaa ho gai
 Changes in the nature of politics and the rise of new states during the Cold War era changed the entire international environment
 parinamswaroop naye upagamon, ayaamon, sansthaaon va pravritiyon kaa sarjan hua jinke madhyam se antarrashtriya sambandhon kaa adhyayan sunishchit ho gaya
 The failures of the ideal, institutional, ethical, legal and reformist streams of the earlier stages led to the development of new approaches
 yah nayaa upagam tha-yatharthwaad
 Although EH Karr, Schwarzenberger, Quincy Right, Shubhan etc
 developed this approach, but Hanes J
 Margenthau presented it as a general principle
 is siddhanth ke anusaar rajya hameshaa apane hiton kii purti hetu sangharshrat rahete hai
 Therefore, to understand international politics, it is very important to understand the various aspects of this power struggle
 yathartwaadee drushtikon ke saath antarrashtriya sansthaaon ke sunishchit va suspasht vikaas ke rup main antarrashtriya sanghathan kii bhi utpatti hui
 Now the form of this organization emerged as an important political organization rather than an idealistic and reformist
 iske antargat maanavjaati ko yuddh kii vibheeshikaa se bachaane ke saath-saath rajyon ke madhya sangharsh ke koun-koun se kaaran hai? vishvashanti hetu khatre ke koun-koun se kaarak hai? shanti kii sthapana kaise ho sakati he? shastron kii hode ko kaise roka ja saktaa he? aadi kai prakaar ke prashnon kaa samaadhaan dhundne ke prayaas bhi kiye gaye
 Along with the above two trends, the origin of behaviorism was also an important achievement of this era
 vyavahaaravaadi drushtikon ke madhyam se ”vyavastha siddhanth“ kii utpatti kar antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Under this approach, it is considered necessary to study three major factors for the study of states
 ye kaarak the- The main force of the above trends has been to promote the ideology of international politics
 atah is yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke saarvbhaumik siddhanton kaa pratipaadan karnaa ati mahatvapurn kaary rahaa he
 As a result of this process of theory formation, many partial theories like - realism, theory of balance, communication theory, sports theory, bargaining theory, peace research approach, system theory, world order model etc
 were created
 in siddhanton ke pratipaadan ke baavjood is yug main kisi ek saarvbhaumik va saamaanya siddhanth kaa abhaav abhi bhi bana rahaa
 In the 1990s, Jayant Bandhopadhyay, in his book - General Theory of International Relations - has tried to overcome the shortcomings of Martin Kaplan's administrative theory, but he is still in a period of debate
 atah saiddhantikaran ke mukhya daur ke baavjood shityudh kaaleen yug apni vaicharik sankeernata va algaav ke kaaran kisi ek saamaanya siddhanth ke pratipaadan se vanchit rahaa
 In the post-cold War era, all nations started joining together under one economic system
 isiilie ab vaishvikaran, udaarikaran, mukt bazaar vyavastha aadi kaa daur prarambh ho gaya
 In this context, not only the importance of economic issues increased, but the importance of international politics also increased
 aaj rashtriyata evam antarrashtriyata kaa vibhed samaapt ho gaya iske atirikt, ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii vishay suchi main kaaphi naveen vishyon kaa samavesh ho gaya jo rashtriya na rahakar ab maanavjaati kii samasyaon ke rup main ubhar kar aaye
 Among the major problems of the current world, terrorism, environment, depletion of ozone layer, trafficking of drugs and drugs, human rights abuses etc
, major issues have emerged which have become mandatory to solve at international level rather than at national level or regional level
 
 saiddhanthik str par bhi 1945 se 1991 tak ke saarvbhaumik siddhanth kii sthapana ke prayaas ko dhakka laga
 Priorities in this context of international politics have now changed
 uttar-aadhuniktawaad main ab saarvbhaumik siddhanton kii sarthakata par prashn chihn lag rahe hai
 The influence of historical context and ancient environment is also being denied
 ab swatantra mudde adhik mahatvapurn ho gaye hai
 Great principles have become secondary
 nae sandarbh main aanshik shodh adhik mahatvapurn ban gai he
 For example, with more emphasis on the topics of feminism, human rights, environment etc
, thinking has also started
 atah shityudhottar yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop, vishay suchi evam vishay kshetra purna rup se parivartit ho gaye hai
 Now too much emphasis is not being laid on the general theoretical establishment
 isiilie is badale hue parivesh main antarrashtriya raajnneeti mahatvapurn hi nahin, apitu swaittata kii ore agrasar prathit ho rahi he
 And there are optimistic signs for the subject's autonomy
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ne na keval antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko moolbhoot rup main prabhavit kiya apitu kai mahatvapurn muddon kii abhivyakti bhi kii
 Changes in the factors of international politics, broadening of factors, rendering of new principles etc
 Apart from many topics, the entire environment of international politics has changed itself
 jahaan ek ore saiddhanthik str par yatharthwaad va adarshavaad ke vaad-vivaad tathaa pracheen va vaigyaniktaa par vaad-vivaad ho rahaa he, vahiin duusari ore vyavhaarik str par antarrashtriya sambandh vishay ke praaroop ke bare main vivaadaaspad prashn uth rahe the ki - kya antarrashtriya sambandh ek swytt vishay he yaa nahin? yadhyapi aaj adhiktar vishvavidhyalayon main snaatak va snatakottar staron par tathaa shodh hetu yah ek swytt vishay ke rup main padhaayaa ja rahaa he, tathaapi ise saamaajik vigyaan ke anya vishyon ke samakaksh manyata nahin mili he
 It has so much happened that in developed countries, it is being taught as a completely autonomous subject in many universities
 bharat jaise vikasshil deshon main bhi sudhaar hua he
 Initially here 'indian School of International Relations, New Delhi' which later on autonomously functions as the School of International Relations at Jawaharlal Nehru University
 iske atirikt kai anya vishvavidhyalayon jaise jadavapur vishvavidhyalay, kalakatta, goa vishvavidhyalay aadi main bhi ab ise swytt vishay kaa darja mila he
 Before studying international relations as an autonomous subject, it is necessary to clarify one thing that when we study the question of autonomy of this subject, 'international politics' and international relations are not considered as separate subjects
 yah isliye kiya gaya he ki donon hi vishyon ko abhi swytt anushaasan na maanakar raajnneetishastra vishay ke ek up-anushaasan ke rup main hi manyata praapt he
 Secondly, the distinction is so subtle that this subject can be resolved after authenticating the autonomy of the discipline
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko swytt vishay maanane ke sandarbh main teen pruthak-pruthak vichaar die gaye hai jo nimna prakaar se hai - According to scholars who consider this subject as autonomous, it should be considered as an autonomous subject given the content and discipline related content of international politics

 These scholars have certified it as an autonomous subject on the following grounds: jo vidwaan antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko ek swytt vishay nahin maanate unka maananaa yah he ki is vishay main aisi koi vilakshan vastu nahin he ki ise adhyayan hetu swytt mana jaae
 He has supported his point on the basis of the following arguments- kuch vidwaan uparyukt donon prakaar kii bahes ko nirarthak maanate hai
 They believe that both of the above arguments can be better understood through the development in international politics
 atah 20veen shatabdi main, or visheshkar 1945 ke baad, ke vikaas kii samiksha ati anivaary he
 If we study deeply the question of autonomy of international politics, then it is known that two fundamental problems have to be faced in this context
 ek to antarrashtriya sambandh ke swaroop, vishaywastu va adhyayan ke tareekon main prabhavi parivartan aaye hai
 Second, at the same time, the problem has increased further due to the complexities of political science and the development of undefined boundaries
 lekin 1919 se aaj tak ke antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas par nazar daalen to spasht hota he ki isaki uplabdhiyaan ise swaittata dilaane main kaaphi sahaayak siddh hongi
 Since 1919, especially in America, many scholars have tried to make this subject more and more scientific
 iske vishay vastu, tareekon evam siddhanth ko suspasht karne ke prayaas bhi hue hai

 The study of parasites is called parasitology
 paraseete vigyaan parajeevon sahit unke mejabaan, tathaa unke bich ke sambandh kaa adhyayan he
 As a subject of biology, the expansion of parasitology does not depend on the animal or its environment, but on their way of life
 atev yah anya vishyon ke, sangyojan se bana he; va kai up-vishyon kii takneekon par aadhaarit he, jaise koshika jaiviki, soochna-jaiviki, jaivaraciniki anvik jaiviki, immunology, anuvaanshiki, vikaswad evam paristhitiki
 The way of life is common on earth

 Each free-living species has its own unique parasitic species

 As a result of excessive research in this science it is able to be described by these two or more definitions

 The oldest category of parasitology belongs to the field of medicine or medicine
 yah maanav ko prabhavit / sankramit karne vaale parjiviyon kaa adhyayan hota he
 It consists of the following areas: - chikitsa parjaiviki se aushadhi vikaas, mahamari vigyaan va xunosis ke adhyayan sambandhit hai
 Parasites that cause economic harm to agriculture, etc
, or infection in animals; His study is called animal parasitism

 In the first freedom struggle he fought with the queen of Jhansi with great valor against the British army and thwarted many attacks of the British army
 yadi lakshmibai ke senanayakon main se ek ne unke saath vishwasghaat na kiya hota to jhaansi kaa kila british sena ke liye praaia: abhedya tha
 The saga of Jhalkari Bai can still be heard in the folklore and folklore of Bundelkhand
 bharat sarkaar ne 22 july 2001 main jhalkaari bai ke sammaan main ek dak tikat jari kiya he, unki pratimaa or ek smarak ajmer, rajasthan main nirmaanadhin he, uttar pradesh sarkaar dwaara unki ek pratimaa agra main sthapit kii gayi he, saath hi unke naam se lakhanu main ek dharmarth chikitsaalay bhi shuru kiya gaya he
 Jhalkari Bai was born on 22 November 1830 in Bhojla village near Jhansi to a poor Koli family
 jhalkaari bai ke pita kaa naam sadovar singh or mata kaa naam jamuna devi tha
 When Jhalkari Bai was very young, her mother died and her father raised her like a boy
 unhen ghudsawaari or hathiyaaron kaa prayog karne main prashikshit kiya gaya tha
 Due to the social conditions of those days, he could not get any formal education, but he had developed himself into a good warrior
 jhalkaari bachapan se hi bahut saahsee or drudh pratijna balika thi
 Jhalkari used to do the house work besides the maintenance of animals and collecting wood from the forest
 ek baar jangal main uski muthbhed ek tendue ke saath ho gayi thi or jhalkaari ne apni kulhadi se us jaanavar ko maar daalaa tha
 On another occasion, when a gang of dacoits attacked a village businessman, Jhalkari had forced him to retreat with his bravery
 uski is bahaduree se khush hokar gaanv waalon ne uskaa vivaah rani lakshmibai kii sena ke ek sainik puuran kori se karvaa diya, puuran bhi bahut bahadur tha or puri sena uski bahaduree kaa loha maanati thi
 Once on the occasion of Gauri Puja Jhalkari along with other women of the village went to the fort of Jhansi to pay respects to the Queen, where Rani Laxmibai was stunned to see her as Jhalkari looked exactly like Rani Laxmibai
 anya auraton se jhalkaari kii bahaduree ke kisse sunakar rani lakshmibai bahut prabhavit huin
 The queen ordered Jhalkari to join the Durga army
 jhalkaari ne yahan anya mahilaon ke saath bandook chalaanaa, top chalaanaa or talwarbaji kii prashikshan liya
 This was the time when Jhansi's army was being strengthened to withstand any British adventurousness
 lard dalhousie kii rajya hadapney kii niti ke chalate, britishon ne niqusantan lakshmibai ko unka uttaradhikari god lene kii anumati nahin di, kyonki ve aisa karke rajya ko apane niyantran main laana chaahate the
 However, in response to this action of the British, the entire army of Rani, its generals and the people of Jhansi rallied with Rani and resolved to take up arms against the British rather than surrender
 april 1858 ke dauraan, lakshmibai ne jhaansi ke kile ke bheetar se, apni sena kaa netritv kiya or british or unke sthaneey sahyogiyon dwaara kiye kai hamalon ko naakaam kar diya
 The groom, one of the queen's generals, betrayed her and opened a protected gate of the fort to the British army
 jab kile kaa patan nishchit ho gaya to rani ke senapatiyon or jhalkaari bai ne unhen kuch sainikon ke saath kila chhodkar bhaagane kii salaah di
 Rani along with some of her trusted soldiers on her horse ventured away from Jhansi
 jhalkaari bai kaa pati puuran kile kii raksha karte hue shahid ho gaya lekin jhalkaari ne bajaay apane pati kii mrityu kaa shok manaane ke, britishon ko dhokhaa dene kii ek yojana banaai
 Jhalkari dressed like Laxmibai and took command of the Jhansi army
 jiske baad vah kile ke baahar nikal british general hug rose ke shivi main usase milane pahanchi
 Upon reaching the British camp, she shouted that she wanted to meet General Hugh Rose
 rose or uske sainik prasann the ki na sirf unhone jhaansi par kabja kar liya he balki jivit rani bhi unke kabze main he
 General Hugh Rose, who considered her the queen, asked Jhalkari Bai what should be done to her
 So he said firmly, hang me
 general hug rose jhalkaari kaa saahas or uski netritv kshamta se bahut prabhavit hua or jhalkaari bai ko reeha kar diya gaya
 On the contrary, some historians believe that Jhalkari got to Veeragati during this war
 ek bundelkhand kinvadanti he ki jhalkaari ke is uttar se general hug rose dang rah gaya or usne kaha ki "yadi bharat kii 1% mahilayen bhi uske jaisi ho jaayen to britishon ko jaldi hi bharat chhodana hoga"
 By mainstream historians, Jhalkari Bai's contribution has not been greatly expanded, but modern local writers have elevated him from oblivion

 Both Annadvardhan and Abhinavagupta supported the Ras Mat by showing an unbreakable relationship between rasa and sound
 anndavardhan ne 'ras dhwani' ko sarvshereshth dhwani mana hai jabaki abhinavgupt ras-dhwani ko 'dhvanit' yaa 'abhivyanjit' maanate hai

 Injections will usually be required for about 10 days
 During this cycle, natural ovulation is usually prevented with the use of gnrh agonists that begin before or during stimulation, or with the use of gnrh antagonists that are used only during the last days of stimulation; Both factors block the natural overgrowth of luteinizing hormones, and the physician can initiate the process of ovulation with the help of drugs, usually injectable human coronary gonadotropins
 jab yah tay kiya jaataa he putakeey paripakvata upyukt he, to human korionic gonedotropins diya jaataa he
 This factor, acting as an analogue of luteinizing hormone, caused ovulation to occur 42 hours after injection, but a recovery process commenced just before that to receive the ovarian cells from the ovary

 Although in many Canadian, American and Australian programs, embryos are housed in a long culture system and transfer is performed at the blastocyst stage about five days after retrieval , especially if there are still many high quality embryos available on the third day
 It has been observed that blastocyst phase transfers result in higher conception rates

 "pregnancy" data may be indicative of a positive pregnancy test and not necessarily a "viable conception", which indicates the fetal beats
 jin garbhaadhanon ke falswaroop jivit shishu janm hota he, unhen jivit janm dar kehete hai
 Nowadays in most cases a distinction is made between single and twin or more than one conception, because more than one, especially more than twin, pregnancies should be avoided as they carry many risks for the mother and the fetus
 unnat takanic kii madad se kuch varsh pehle kii tulana main aaj garbhaadhan kii daren kaafii behatar ho gai hai

 ivief upachaar band karne ke baad shishu janm mukhyatah dattak lene ke kaaran yaa sahaj garbhaadhan ke kaaran hua
 The live birth rate is the percentage of all IVF cycles that result in infant birth and this rate is equal to the conception rate adjusted for miscarriage and stillbirth
