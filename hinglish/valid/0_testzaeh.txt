 is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Black hole ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 In general relativity, a black hole or a black hole or a Krishna vivar is such an astronomical object with such a powerful gravitational field that nothing can escape the light, including the stretch
 kalenidr ke chaaron ore ghatana kshitij naamak ek seemaa hoti he jisamen vastuen gir to sakati hai parantu baahar kuch nahin aa saktaa
 It is called "black" because it absorbs all the light falling on it and does not reflect anything
 yah ooshmaagatiki main thik ek adarsh krishnika kii tarah he
 Quantum analysis of the black hole shows that they contain temperature and Hawking radiation
 apane adrishy bhitari bhaag ke baavjood, ek kalachhidr anya padaarthon ke saath antah-kriya ke madhyam se apni upasthiti prakat kar saktaa he
 For example, black holes can be detected by the motion of a group of stars orbiting a part of the space that appears empty
 vaikalpik rup se, ek saathi taare dwaara aap apekshaakrit chote kalenidr main gas giraate hue dekh sakate hai
 This gas spirals inwards, heating up to very high temperatures and emits large amounts of radiation that can be detected by telescopes located on Earth or orbiting the Earth
 is tarah ke avlokanon ke parinaam swaroop yah vaigyanik sarv-sammati ubhar kar saamne ai he ki, unke swayan na dikhne ke baavjood, hamaare brahmad main kalenidr astitv rakhte he
 By these methods, scientists have discovered that a radio source called Dhanu a *, located in the center of our galaxy, Kshirmarg, has a giant black hole whose mass is 43 million times the mass of our sun
 saidhantik rup se, kisi bhi maatra kaa padaarth ek kalachhidr ban saktaa he, yadi vah itani jagah ke bheetar sankuchit ho jaay jisaki trigya apni samatuly schvarsscield trigya ke baraabar ho
 Accordingly, the mass of our Sun is 3 km
 m Radius of the earth and 9 mm of the earth It can turn into black hole when inside
 vyaavhaarik rup main electron or neutron aapjatya dabaav ke vipareet na to prithvi or na hi suraj main aavashyak dravyaman he or isliye na hi aavashyak gurutvkarshan bal he
 The minimum mass required for a star to be able to recover from these pressures and to be more compressed is the extent proposed by Tolman - Oppenheimer - Volkoff, which is about three solar masses
 ek kalenidr ko aksar ek aisi vastu rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jiskaa palaayan veg prakaash kii gati se adhik ho
 This picture is qualitatively incorrect but provides a way of understanding the order of magnitude of the radius of the black hole
 palaayan veg vah nunatam gati he jo ek vastu main honi chahie taaki vah vastu rukne se pehle kisi guruttvakarshan strot kii kaksha se bachakar nikal jaye
 The escape velocity on Earth is equal to 11
2 km / s, so no matter what the object is, a bullet or a ball, it must move at least 11
2 km / s to avoid falling back to the surface of the Earth
 neutonian yantriki main palaayan veg kii gananaa hetu, maaniye ki ek baari vastu he jiskaa dravyaman m mul par kendrit he
 a second object with a m { \ displaystyle m} mass starts at a v { \ displaystyle v} speed at a distance of r { \ displaystyle r} from the origin, tries to escape towards the infinity, with exactly the same kinetic energy
 Should be so that it can overcome the potential energy of negative gravity, leaving nothing later: is prakaar, yah jaise jaise r = ∞ { \ displaystyle r= \ infty } ke kareeb aati jaati he vaise vaise isaki gatij urja kam hoti jaati he, antat yah bina kisi gati ke ananthata par pahunch jaati he
 This formula represents the critical migration velocity v { \ displaystyle v} in terms of m { \ displaystyle M} and r { \ displaystyle r}
 lekin yah formula yah bhi kahata he ki v { \ displaystyle v} or m { \ displaystyle M} kii prayek value ke liye, r { \ displaystyle r} kii ek critical value hoti he taaki v { \ displaystyle v} gati vaala ek kan bhaagane maatr main safal rahe: When the velocity is equal to the speed of light, it provides the radius of an imaginary Newtonian dark star, a Newtonian body from which no particle moving at the speed of light can escape
 ek kalenidr kii trigya kii value ke liye sarvaadhik prayukt chalan main, ghatana kshitij kii trigya is neutonian value ke baraabar hoti he
 In general relativity, it is not easy to define r coordinates because of the curved nature of space-time and the selection of different coordinates
 is parinaam ke satya hone ke liye, r kii value ko is prakaar paribhaashit karnaa chahie taaki vakrit antariksh samay main r trigya ek sphier ke a satahi kshetra ko abhi bhi is formula dwaara prakat kiya ja sake a = 4 π r 2 { \ displaystyle A=4 \ pi r^{2}} r kii is paribhaasha se koi arth tabhi nikalataa he jab gurutvkarshan kshetra spherickli samamit ho, taaki vahaan ek ke upar ek kai siyaar hon jinpar ekasmaan gurutvkarshan kshetra ho
 The escape velocity depends on the density of an object to escape its gravitational field; This is the ratio of its mass to volume
 ek kalachhidr tab banataa he jab koi vastu itani ghani ho jaye ki kisi khaas duuri tak prakaash bhi usase bachakar na jane paye, kyonki prakaash kii gati kalenidr ke palaayan veg se kam hogi
 Unlike Newtonian gravity, in general relativity, the light moving away from the black hole does not slow down and turn back
 schvarjaschild trigya abhi bhi vah antim duuri he jahaan se prakaash anantta ke liye batch saktaa he, lekin schvarjaschild trigya se shuru hokar baahar nikalne vaala prakaash waapas nahin aata he, vah baahar hi rahata he
 Inside the Schwarzschild radius, each object moves inwards, somehow to be crushed in the center
 saamaanya saapekshata main, kalachhidr kaa dravyaman kisi gurutveey apurvata) par kendrit rah saktaa he, yah ek bindu, ek challa, ek prakaash kiran, yaa ek sphier ho saktaa he; vartmaan main iske vishay main thik thik jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 There is a circular border around this singularity called the event horizon
 yah ghatana kshitij ko 'waapas lautne kaa sthaan' hota he, ek seemaa jiske pare saare padaarth or vikiran bheetar singhulerity kii taraf khinche chale aate hai
 Centrally, the distance between this singularity and the event horizon is the size of the black hole and is equal to twice the mass in the unit where g and c are equal to 1
 surya ke baraabar dravyaman vaale kalenidr kii trigya lagbhag 3 kimi hoti he
 For distances many times greater than this, the gravitational power of the black hole is exactly equal to the gravitational power of any other body of equal mass, just like the Sun
 isliye yadi surya ko samaan dravyaman vaale ek kalenidr ke parivartit kar diya jaye, grahon kii kakshaen aparivartit rahengi
 There are several types of black holes, which are identified by their specific size
 jab ve ek tara ke gurutvkarshan patan ke kaaran banate hai, unhen taarakeey kalachhidr kaha jaataa he
 The mass of black holes formed at the center of galaxies can be several billion times the solar mass, they are called giant black holes because they are very large
 in donon paimaanon ke bich main kuch madhyavarti kalenidr bhi hote hai jinke dravyaman saura dravyaman ke kai hajaar gune tak hote hai
 Very low-mass black holes that are thought to have formed during the Big Bang in the early history of the universe may still exist and are called primordial black holes
 vartmaan main unka astitv abhi nishchit nahin he
 It is not possible to see a black hole directly
 haalaanki, aasapaas ke paryaavaran par uske guruttviya prabhaav dwaara uski upasthiti kaa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he, khaas kar microkvasar or sakriya gallexic nabhikon dwaara, jahaan paas ke kalenidr main girane vaale padaarth ati garam ho jate hai or eks-re vikiran kii badi maatra chhodte hai
 This observation method enables astronomers to ascertain their existence
 kalenidr ekmaatr aise padaarth hai jo in paimaanon par khare utarate hai or saamaanya saapekshata ke dhaanche ke anuroop hote hai
 The concept of a heavy body so incapable of escaping even light was revealed in a letter written by geologist John Michel to Henry Cavendish in 1783 and published by the Royal Society: 1796 main, ganitagya pierre-simon laplas ne apni kitaab exposishan du system du monde ke pehle or duusare sanskaran main isi vichaar ko badhaava diya tha 
 These "dark stars" were ignored in the nineteenth century, because then it was believed that light was a massless wave and therefore free from the effects of gravity
 aadhunik blike hole avadharana ke vipareet, aisa mana jaataa tha ki kshitij ke peeche kii vastu kaa patan nahin ho saktaa he
 In 1915, Albert Einstein developed his general theory of relativity, he had already proved that gravity actually affects the speed of light
 kuch maheene baad, karl schvarjaschild ne ek bindu drabyaman or ek golakaar dravyaman ke gurutvkarshan kshetra kaa samaadhaan diya, yah dikhaate hue ki ek blike hole kaa astitv siddhanthata sambhav he
 The Schwarzschild radius is now known as the radius of the event horizon of non-rotating black holes, but this fact was not understood at the time, for example Schwarzschild himself did not consider it physical
 johanise droste nen, hendrick lorentz ke ek chaatr, swatantra rup se bindu dravyaman par schvarjaschild ke kuch maheenon ke baad aisa hi samaadhaan diya or iske gunon ke bare main bade paimaane par or adhik likhaa
 In 1930, astronomer Subramanian Chandrasekhar, using general relativity, calculated that the solar mass of a non-rotating body containing electron-generated matter would collapse if it exceeded 1
44
 unke tark kaa arthur edington dwaara virodh kiya gaya tha, jinka vishwaas tha ki koi vastu nishchit rup se is patan ko rokegi
 Eddington was partially right: a slightly dwarf white dwarf star above the Chandrasekhar range would transform into a neutron star after its collapse
 But in 1939, Robert Oppenheimer and his colleagues predicted that due to the reasons given by Chandrasekhar, a star with more than three solar masses would collapse into a black hole
 oppenheimer or unke sah lekhakon ne shwarzschild nirdeshaank pranali kaa upyog kiya, jisane shwarzschild trigya par ganitiya vishistataa ko utpaadit kiya, duusare shabdon main, is sameekaran main istamaal kiye gaye kuch ghatak shwarzschild trigya par anant ho jate the
 This implies that the Schwarzschild radius was the boundary of a "bubble" in which time "stopped"
 yah baahar se dekhne waalon ke liye ek vaid bindu he, lekin andar girane waalon ke liye nahin
 Because of this feature, collapsed stars have been known as "frozen stars" for some time, as an external observer will see the star's surface frozen at the moment the star's collapse falls within the Schwarzschild radius
 Must be taking yah aadhunik blike holon kaa ek gyaat lakshan he, lekin is baat par bal diya janaa chahie ki jame hue taare kii sataha kaa prakaash bahut jaldi redshifted ho jaataa he or blike hole ko bahut jaldi kaale rang kaa bana detaa he
 Many physicists were unable to accept the idea that time halts within the Schwarzschild radius and that people had no interest in the subject for 20 years
 1958 main, david phinkeistein ne edington-phinkelsten nirdeshaank prastut karte hue ghatana kshitij kii avadharana pesh kii, jisane unhen yah sabit karne main sakasham kiya ki schvarjaschild sataha r= 2 m ek vishistataa nahin he balki yah ek adarsh ekaladisha jhilli ke rup main kaary karata he: karnatmak prabhaav ise ek hi disha main paar kar sakate hai
 There was no significant contradiction in this and Oppenheimer's results, but it expanded it by adding a falling observer's viewpoint
 finkelstin samet, abhi tak ke saare siddhant keval gaiyr-chakrit blike holon ko cover karte the
 In 1963, Roy Kerr found the perfect solution for recurring black holes
 isaki chakrit singhulerity ek bindu nahin balki ek challa thi
 After some time, Roger Penrose is able to prove that singularity is found within all black holes
 1967 main, khagolavidon ne pulsar kii khoj kii or kuch varshon ke bheetar yah sabit karne main sakasham ho gayi ki gyaat pulsar, teji se chakrit neutron taare hi hai
 By that time, neutron stars were also confined to theoretical curiosity only
 isliye pulsar kii khoj ne un sabhi ati ghanatv vaali vastuon ke prati ruchi ko jaagrit kiya jinaki sanrachana gurutveey patan se hona sambhav hua hoga
 Physicist John Wheeler is widely credited with coining the term black hole in his public speech Our Universe: Known and Unknown in 1967, more cumulatively as an alternative to the "star that has gravitationally fallen to full collapse"
 in the form of
 haalanki, whealer ne jor diya tha ki sammelan main yah shabd kisi or ne gadha tha or unhone isko keval ek upyogi laghu-shabd ke rup main apanaaya
 The term was also cited in a letter to AAAS by Anne Ewing in 1964: jab kisi bade taare kaa puraa kaa puraa eendhan jal jaataa he to usamen ek jabardast visphot hota he jise supernova kehete hai
 The substance that survives after the explosion slowly starts to shrink and takes the form of a very dense mass called a neutron star
 agar neutron star bahut vishaal he to gurutvkarshan kaa dabaav itnaa hoga ki vah apane hi boj se simatata chalaa jayega or itnaa ghanaa ho jayega ki blike hole ban jayega or shyaam vivar, krishna gart yaa blike hole ke rup main dikhaai degaa
 The No Hair Theorem states that, once established, a black hole has only three independent physical characteristics: mass, charge, and angular momentum
 kinhin do blike hole kii in visheshtaon yaa parameter kii value yadi samaan ho to unke bich bhed karnaa kaaphi dushkar ho jaataa he
 These characteristics are special because they are visible from outside the black hole
 udhaaharan ke liye, anya kisi chargekrit vastu kii hi tarah ek chargekrit blike hole bhi samaan charge ko dur dhakelta he, is tathy ke baavjood bhi ki vidyut or chumbakeey balon ke liye jimmedaar kan photauns, aatanrik kshetra se bachakar nikal nahin pate hai
 The reason for this is the Gauss law, the total electric current exiting a large sphere is always the same and measures the total charge within the sphere
 jab charge blike hole main girtaa he, vidyut kshetra line bani rahati hai or kshitij se baahar kii or jhaankati rahati hai or ye kshetra line girane vaale sabhi padaarthon ke kul charge ko sangrakshit karti hai
 Electric field lines eventually spread uniformly across the surface of the black hole, establishing uniform field line density on the surface
 is sandarbh main blike hole ek aam condkating sphier kii tarah kaam karata he jisaki ek nishchit rasistivity hoti he
 Similarly, the total mass of a sphere containing a black hole can be found using the gravitational analog of the Gauss law, sitting far away from the black hole
 isi tarah, koniya gati ko bahut dur se, guruttviya-chumbakeey kshetra dwaara frem dreging kaa upyog karke mapa ja saktaa he
 When a black hole swallows a substance, its horizon oscillates like a wide membrane with friction, a transient system, until it is finally established
 yah vidyut-chumbakatv yaa gej siddhant jaise anya kshetra siddhant se alag he, jinamein kabhi bhi koi gharshan yaa rasistivity nahin hoti kyonki ve samay palatwaan hote hai
 Because a black hole eventually sets up in a final state with only three parameters, there is no way to avoid losing information about the initial conditions: very little about the gravity and electric field of the black hole
 Be able to provide information lupt jaankaree main ve sabhi chijen shaamil hai jinhen blike hole kshitij se bahut duuri se mapa nahin ja saktaa he, jaise kii, kul beryon number, laptone number, tathaa kan bhautikee ke lagbhag sabhi anya sangrakshit sudo-charge
 From here on, this behavior is so strange that it has been called the 'black hole information loss paradox'
 paaramparik rup se bhi blike hole main jaankaree kaa lupt hona kaaphi ajeeb he, kyonki saamaanya saapekshata ek lagrengian siddhant he jo upar upar se time reversible or hamiltonian prathit hota he
 But the black hole is not reversible due to the horizon: matter can penetrate into it but cannot escape
 ek aam blike hole main samay ke palatney ko white hole kaha gaya he, haalaanki entropy or kwantum makenix yah darshaate hai ki white hole blike hole ke samaan hi hai
 The no-hair theorem makes some assumptions about the nature of our universe and the substances involved, while other assumptions provide different conclusions
 udahaaran ke liye, yadi chumbakeey ekal-dhruvon kaa astitv he, jaisaa ki kuch siddhanton dwaara kaha gaya he, chumbakeey charge ek parmparik blike hole kaa chauthaa maapdand hoga
 Examples of the no-hair theorem are known for the following cases: ye apwaad kabhi kabhi asthir hote hai or kabhi kabhi blike hole se dur nai sangrakshit kwantum sankhyaon tak nahin le jate hai
 This theorem must apply in our four-dimensional and almost flat universe
 saralatam blike hole vah he jiskaa drabyaman he lekin na to charge he or na hi koniya gati
 These black holes are also known as Schwarzschild black holes, named after the physicist Karl Schwarzschild who discovered this solution in 1915
 yah oinstin kshetra sameekaran ke liye khoja jane vaala pehla vishwasaneey or sateek samaadhaan tha or birkhophf prameya ke anusaar yah ekmaatr nirvaat samaadhaan he jo spherickli cymetric he
 This means that there is no visible difference between the gravitational field of such a black hole and the gravitational field of any other spherical object of equal mass
 blike hole ke liye yah lokapriy dharna kii yah apane chaaron ore "prayek vastu ko andar khinchataa rahata he" keval iske kshitij ke paas hi satya baithti he; duuri par, iskaa bahari gurutvkarshan kshetra anivaary rup se saadhaaran baari pindon kii tarah kaa hi hota he
 More common solutions to black holes were discovered in the late 20th century
 reissner-nordastrom metric vidyut charge vaale blike hole kaa varnan karata he, jabaki kerr metric ek chakrit blike hole pradaan karata he
 The Kerr – Newman metric is generally the more prevalent stationary black hole solution, which describes both charge and angular momentum
 haalanki ek blike hole kaa dravyaman koi bhi positive mulya le saktaa he, charge or koniya gati dravyaman dwaara baadhya hote hai
 In natural units, the total charge q { \ displaystyle q \ ,} and the total angular momentum j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} are expected to satisfy the following m dravyaman vaale ek blike hole ke liye
 The black hole that fills this disparity is called extreme
 asamanta kaa ulanghan karne vaale oinstin ke samikarnon ke samaadhaanon kaa astitv he, lekin unamem kshitij nahin he
 These solutions have naked specificity and are considered immaterial, because the cosmic censorship hypothesis rejects this specificity because of the overall gravitational collapse of real substances
 yah sankhyatmak anukritiyon dwaara samarthit he
 Due to the relatively large force of the electromagnetic force, black holes formed by the collapse of stars are expected to retain the neutral charge of the stars
 chakran ko compact vastuon kaa ek saamaanya gun mana gaya he or aisa prathit hota he ki blike hole ke pratyaashee binary X-ray source GRS 1915+105 kii koniya gati apane adhiktam sambhav value ke kareeb he
 Black holes are generally classified according to their mass, independent of the angular momentum j { \ displaystyle j \ ,}
 The size of a black hole determined by the event horizon radius, or the Schwarzschild radius, is proportional to the mass m { \ displaystyle m \ ,}, jahaan r s h { \ displaystyle r_{sh} \ ,} schvarjaschild trigya he or m ⨀ { \ displaystyle M_{ \ bigodot }} surya kaa dravyaman he
 Thus the size and mass of a black hole are simply related, independent of rotation
 is kasuti ke anusaar, blike holon ko is prakaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he: The characteristic of a black hole is the appearance of the event horizon; a space of time beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer
 jaisaa ki saamaanya saapekshata ne bhavishyavaanee kii thi, dravyaman kii upasthiti antariksh-samay ko is prakaar vikrut kar detii he ki kanon ke maarg unhen us dravyaman kii taraf le jate hai
 This deformation becomes so powerful on the incident horizon of the black hole that there is no way to go out
 ek baar koi kan ghatana kshitij ke andar aa jaye, uskaa blike hole ke bheetar janaa avashyambhavi ho jaataa he
 For a spectator standing far away, the clocks near the black hole would seem to move more slowly
 is prabhaav ke kaaran, dur khadaa darshak yah dekhegaa ki blike hole main girane vaali koi vastu uske ghatana kshitij ke nikat aane par dhimi ho jaati he, us tak pahunchne ke liye anant samay leti hui prathit hoti he
 At the same time all the actions of this object slow down, resulting in the light appearing more red and dim, this effect is called gravitational red shift
 ant main, girane vaali vastu itani maddham ho jaati he ki dikhaai dena band ho jaati he, ek bindu par ghatana kshitij par pahunchne se thik pehle
 The Schwarzschild radius limits non-spherical event horizons for non-rotating black holes
 ek vastu kii schvarjaschild trigya dravyaman ke anupaat main hoti he
 Circled black holes have a distorted, nonspherical event horizon
 chunki ghatana kshitij ek bhautik sataha nahin he balki keval ek ganitiya paribhaashit seemaa he, padaarth yaa vikiran ko blike hole main pravesh karne se rokane vaala kuch bhi nahin he, keval baahar nikalne se inako roka jaataa he
 The description given by general relativity for black holes is an approximation and it is expected that quantum gravity effects become important from near the event horizon
 yah, blike hole ke ghatana kshitij ke nikat padaarth ke prekshan ko, saamaanya saapekshata or uske prastaavit vistaaron ke adhyayan ko sambhav banaata he
 Although black holes themselves do not radiate energy, electromagnetic radiation and matter particles can radiate from outside the event horizon, via Hawking radiation
 singhulerity blike hole ke centre main hoti he, jahaan padaarth main dabane ke kaaran anant ghanatv ho jaataa he, gurutvkarshan khinchaav anant shaktishaalee hota he or antariksh-samay main anant vikruti hoti he
 This means the mass of a black hole is completely compressed into a region with zero volume
 blike hole ke centre main is shunya-aaytan, anant rup se saghan kshetra ko gurutveey singhulerity kaha jaataa he
 The singularity of a non-rotating black hole is zero in length, width, and height; The singularity of a rotating black hole is ring-shaped and is located on the plane of rotation
 challe main koi motaai nahin hoti isliye koi aaytan nahin hota
 The presence of singularity in general relativity is generally considered an indication of the principle not being applied
 haalaanki yah apekshit he; yah aisi paristhiti main ghatit hota he jahaan kwantum yantric prabhaavon ko inkaa varnan karnaa chahie tha, ati ucch ghanatv or kan sahabhaagitaaon ke kaaran
 Until now it has not been possible to combine the effects of quantum and gravity in one theory
 aam taur par ummid kii jaati he ki kwantum gurutv ke siddhant main singulerity rahit blike hole honge
 The photon sphere is a spherical boundary of zero thickness where the photons will be trapped in a circular orbit, moving along the tangent of the sphere
 anavarti blike hole ke liye, photone sphere kii trigya schvarjaschild trigya kii 1
5 guna hoti he
 These orbits are dynamically unstable, so any small disturbance will also grow larger over time and either throw it beyond the black hole or push it within the event horizon
 haalaanki prakaash abhi bhi photone sphere ke andar se batch saktaa he, koi prakaash jo andar kii or jaati prakshepan path se photone kshetra ko paar karti he us par blike hole kaa kabja ho jaayegaa
 Therefore any light that reaches an audience standing outside from inside the photon sphere must have been emitted by an object outside the photon sphere but beyond the event horizon
 neutron taron jaisi anya compact vastuon main bhi photone sphere ho sakate hai
 This is based on the fact that the gravitational field of an object does not depend on its actual size, so an object that is smaller than 1
5 times the Schwarzschild radius would actually have a photon sphere corresponding to the object's mass
 chakrit blike hole chaaron taraf se argosphior namak ek antariksh-samay kshetra se ghira hota he jisamen sthir khada hona asambhav he
 This is the result of a process called frame-dragging; General relativity predicts that any rotating mass will try to stretch the space-time around itself
 chakrit drabyaman ke paas kii koi bhi vastu chakra kii disha main ghoomana shuru kar degi
 For a rotating black hole, its impact becomes so strong near the event horizon that an object would have to move faster than the speed of light in the opposite direction just to stand still
 ek blike hole kaa argosphior nimnlikhit se ghira hota he: Within the ergosphere, space-time is drawn at a greater speed than light - in general relativity physical objects are forbidden to move faster than light, but space-time zones allow them to be compared to other space-time regions i can walk faster than light
 vasteen or vikiran, centre main gire bina argosphior ke bheetar kaksha main rah sakati hai
 But they cannot hover, because this would require them to travel faster than light backwards, compared to their own space-time zone, which is moving faster than light compared to an outside viewer
 vasteen or vikiran bhi argosphior se batch kar nikal sakate hai
 In fact, the Penrose process predicts that objects will sometimes fly out of the agosphere, for this they will gain energy by "stealing" some of the black hole's energy
 agar vastuon ke kul drabyaman kaa bada bhaag is tarah batch nikalataa he, blike hole kii ghoomane kii gati or dhimi pad jaayegi or antat shaayad ghoomana band bhi ho jaye | The fascinating image of the black hole is bound to raise the question of whether such bizarre objects actually exist, or are they merely imaginary solutions to the Einstein equations
 oinstin kii swayan kr yah galat dharna thi ki blike holon kaa nirmaan sambhav nahin he, kyonki unka vishwaas tha ki patan kii ore agrasar kanon kii koniya gati unki chaal ko sthirataa pradaan karegi
 Because of this, the general relativity community continued to dismiss its opposing results for many years
 lekin unamem se kuch is vishwaas par kaayam rahe ki blike hole kaa astitv vastav main he, or 1960 ke dashak ke ant tak ve adhikansh shodhakartaaon ko yah vishwaas dilaane main safal rahe ki ghatana kshitij kaa nirmaan vaaki main sambhav he
 Once upon a time, Roger Penrose proved that there must be some form of syngularity within him
 iske kuch hi samay pashchaat, stephen hawking ne yah darshaya ki big baing ke kai brahmadia samaadhaanon main singulerity kaa astitv he, scaler kshetron or anya videshi padaarthon kii anupasthiti main 
 The Kerr solution, the no-hair theorem, and the laws of black hole thermodynamics showed that the physical characteristics of a black hole are simple and easily understandable, making them respected research subjects
 aisa mana jaataa he ki blike holon ke nirmaan kii praathmik prakriya taron jaisi baari vastuon kaa guruttviya patan rahi hogi, lekin kai anya prakriyaayein bhi hai jo blike hole ke nirmaan kii taraf le ja sakati hai
 Gravitational collapse occurs when the internal pressure of an object is insufficient to resist its own gravity
 taron main yah aamtaur par isliye hota he kyonki yaa to taron main apane taapmaana ko banaae rakhane ke liye "eendhan" aparyaapt he, yaa ek tara jo sthir tha use dher saare atirikt padaarth mili parantu uske crod kaa taapmaana nahin badhaa
 In both cases, star temperature would prove insufficient to prevent its collapse under its own weight
 is patan ko taare ke ghatakon ke aapjatya dabaav dwaara roka ja saktaa he, padaarth ek aakarshak ghani avasthaa main sanghanit ho jaataa he
 The result is a type of compact star
 What type of compact star will form will depend on the mass of the residue - the residuals have decimated the outer surfaces after the changes caused by the collapse
 note karen ki yah mul taare se kaaphi kam hoga- 5 se adhik saura drabyaman vaale avasheshon kaa utpaadan aise taron se hota he jinka dravyaman patan se pehle 20 se adhik rahaa hoga
 If the mass of the residue exceeds ~ 3-4 solar masses - because the original star was either too heavy or the residue has collected additional mass) - the neutron's inelastic pressure is also insufficient to prevent collapse
 iske baad aisi koi gyaat prakriya nahin he jo is patan ko roak sake or vastu patit ho kar blike hole main tabdeel ho jaayegi
 This gravitational collapse of heavy stars is attributed to the formation of most stellar mass black holes
 gurutveey patan ke liye bahut adhik ghanatv kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In the current age of the universe, this high density is found only in stars, but in the early universe the density was much higher soon after the Big Bang, which may have made the creation of black holes possible
 ucch ghanatv akele ek blike hole ke nirmaan ke liye paryaapt nahin he kyonki drabyaman kaa samaan vitaran, drabyaman ko ikattha hone kii anumati nahin degaa
 For the formation of ancient black holes in this dense medium, it is necessary to have initial cubic disturbances that can later grow under the influence of their own gravity
 praarambhik brahmad ke vibhinn modelon main in gadbadiyon ke aakaar ke bare main vyapak matbhed he
 Various models predicted the creation of black holes, ranging from Planck masses to hundreds of thousands of solar masses
 atah aadim blike hole kisi bhi prakaar ke blike hole ke nirmaan kaa kaaran ho sakate hai
 Gravitational collapse is not the only process that can create a black hole
 siddhant rup main, blike hole kaa nirmaan ucch urja takkaron main bhi sambhav he jo paryaapt ghanatv paidaa karti hai
 However, so far, no such phenomenon has been detected, either directly or indirectly, as a lack of oscillating equilibrium in particle accelerator experiments
 iskaa arth yah nikalataa he ki blike hole ke dravyaman ke liye ek nichali seemaa honi chahie
 Theoretically, this limit should be around the Planck mass, where it is expected that quantum effects would prove the theory of general relativity to be false
 is kaaran prithvi yaa uske aas paas blike hole ke nirmaan kii sambhaavna ko bilkul nakaara ja saktaa he
 However, some developments in quantum gravity suggest that the limit of this bond may be considerably lower
 udahaaran ke liye, kuch brinworld paridrishy plank dravyaman ko kaaphi neeche rakhte hai, shaayad 1 tev / c2 itnaa neeche tak
 This may allow the creation of microscopic black holes in high-energy collisions or large Hadron colliders of the CERN
 haalaanki ye saare siddhant kaaphi kaalpanik hai or kai vaigyaniko kaa mat he ki in prakriyaaon main blike hole kaa nirmaan sambhav nahin he
 Black holes, once formed, continue to develop by absorption of additional substances
 saare blike hole antartaarkeey dhul or sarvyaapee vikiran ko lagaataar avashoshit karte rahenge, lekin inamen se kisi bhi prakriya kaa ek taarakeey blike hole ke dravyaman par koi khaas prabhaav nahin padataa he
 More significant contributions occur when a black hole is formed in a binary star system
 nirmaan ke baad blike hole apane saathi se kaaphi maatra main padaarth avashoshit kar saktaa he
 Extremely large contributions occur when a black hole merges with other stars or compact objects
 adhikansh akashgangaon ke centre main sthit ati vishalkay blike holon kaa nirmaan sambhawatah kai choti vastuon ke vilay ke dwaara hua hoga
 The same process has also been proposed to form some intermediate-mass black holes
 jaise jaise ek vastu ghatana kshitij kii taraf babbti he, kshitij phoolnaa aarambh kar detaa he or lapak kar usko nigal letaa he
 Shortly thereafter, the expansion of the radius is evenly distributed throughout the hole
 1974 main, stephen hawking ne dikhaaya ki blike hole puri tarah se kaale nahin hai, balki ye thodi maatra main tapiya vikiran bhi nikaalte hai
 They found this result using quantum field theory in a stable black hole background
 unke samikarnon kaa parinaam yah he ki ek blike hole ko kanon ko ek adarsh blike body spectrum main chhodana chahie
 This effect became known as Hawking radiation
 hawking parinaam ke baad se, kaiyon nen vibhinn tareekon ke madhyam se is prabhaav ko satyapit kiya he
 If this theory of black hole radiation is correct, then it is expected that the black holes will remove the thermal beam of radiation and this will cause the mass to decay, since according to the theory of relativity, the mass is just the high condensed energy
 Over time, black holes will shrink and fly in the air
 is kiranpunj kaa taapmaana blike hole ke satahi gurutvkarshanake anupatik rahata he, jo badale main dravyaman ke liye vipareet rup main anupaatik rahata he
 Hence larger black holes emit less radiation than smaller black holes
 5 saura drabyaman vaale ek taarakeey blike hole kaa hawking taapmaana kareeb 12 nanokelvins hota he
 This is much lower than the 2
7K produced by the space micro-wave background
 taarakeey dravyaman vaale blike hole hawking vikiran ke madhyam se jitna drabyaman chhodte hai usase adhik dravyaman ve cosmik microwave prishthbhumi se praapt kar lete hai, atah ve sikudne kii bajaay failte jate hai
 To achieve Hawking temperatures higher than 2
7 K, a black hole would have to be lighter than the Moon
 duusari taraf yadi ek blike hole bahut chota he, ummid kii jaati he ki uskaa vikiran kaa prabhaav bahut shaktishaalee ho jaayegaa
 a black hole that is even heavier than humans will vanish in a moment
 ek car ke vajan vaala blike hole ko vashpit hone ke liye maatr ek nanosecond kaa samay hi lagegaa, is dauraan kuch kshanon ke liye isaki chamak surya se 200 guna se bhi adhik ho jaayegi
 Light black holes are expected to evaporate even faster, for example a black hole with 1 tev / c 2 mass will take less than 10–88 seconds to completely disappear
 beshak, itane chote blike hole ke liye kwantum gurutv prabhaav se ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane kii ummid kii jaati he or yahan tak ki – haalaanki kwantum gurutv main hue haal ke vikaas is ore koi sanket nahin karte hai – parikaalpanik taur par aise chote blike hole sthir honge
 The presence of most accretion disks and gas jets is not a clear evidence of the presence of stellar mass black holes, as other more massless and very dense objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs can cause and create accretion disks and gas currents
 The behavior is the same as that around a black hole
 lekin ve aksar khagolavidon kii yah batalaakar madad kar sakati hai ki kis jagah blike hole kii talash faldaayi siddh ho sakati he
 But on the other hand, supermassive accretion disks and gas currents can be a good proof of the presence of a highly soluble black hole, because as far as we know, only one black hole can be the cause of these phenomena
 sthir eks-re or gamma kiran utsarjan bhi kisi blike hole kii maujuudagi sabit nahin karte hai, lekin khagolavidon ko yah bataa sakate hai ki kahan khoj karnaa faldaayi hoga- or inaki ye khubi hoti he ki ve kaaphi aasaani se nabulai or gas ke badalon se nikal pate hai
 But powerful, irregular X-rays, gamma rays and other electromagnetic radiation can help prove that that massive, super-dense object is not a black hole, so that the "black hole hunter" is focused on another object Can do
 neutron taron or anya ati saghan taron par satahen hoti hai or padaarthon kaa prakaash kii gati ke ek ucch pratishat par sataha ke saath takaraav, aniyamit antaraalon par vikiran kii gahan lapaton kaa utsarjan karata he
 The black hole has no solid surface, so the absence of intense flames of radiation at irregular intervals around a very densely compact object indicates that there may be a good chance of a black hole
 gahan parantu ek hi baar gamma kiran kaa nikalnaa kisi "nae" blike hole ke janm kaa sanket ho saktaa he, kyonki khagol-bhautikavidon kaa vichaar he ki grbs kaa kaaran yaa to kisi vishaal taare kaa gurutveey patan he athwa neutron taron ke bich takaraav, or in donon ghatnaon main blike hole kaa srijan karne hetu paryaapt drabyaman or dabaav shaamil hota he
 But it appears that a collision between a neutron star and a black hole can also produce a GRB, so a GRB is not evidence that a "new" black hole has formed
 sabhi gyaat GRB hamaari apni akashganga ke baahar se aate hai or adhikansh arabon prakaash varshon kii dur se aate hai isliye inase jude blike hole vastav main arabon varsh puraane hai
 Some space-physicists believe that some super bright X-ray sources may be the accretion disks of intermediate-mass black holes
 aisa mana jaataa he ki kasaar atyadhik drabyaman vaale blike hole kii abhivruddhi discs hai, kyonki ab tak gyaat koi bhi vastu itani shaktishaalee nahin he jo itnaa shaktishaalee utsarzan kar sake
 Quasars produce powerful emissions throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, including UV, X-rays and gamma-rays, and are also visible from a considerable distance due to their high brightness
 5 se 25 pratishat ke bich kasaar "radio laud" hote hai, yah sangya inke shaktishaalee radio utsarjan ke kaaran he
 a gravitational lens is formed when rays of light coming from a far away bright source are "twisted" around a giant object, between the viewer and the source object
 This process is known as gravitational lensing and is one of the predictions of general relativity theory
 is siddhant ke anusaar, drabyaman gurutvkarshan kshetron ko banane ke liye antariksh-samay ko "samete" rahata he or isliye parinamswaroop prakaash ko mode detaa he
 The image of the source behind the lens can appear to an observer as multiple images
 yadi strot, baari lencing vastu or paryvekshak ek sidhi rekha main hon, strot baari vastu ke peeche ek challe ke rup main dikhaai degaa
 Gravitational lensing can also be caused by objects other than black holes, because any very powerful gravitational field has the ability to bend light rays
 in bahu chhaviyon vaale prabhaavon main se kuch, sambhawatah sudur sthit akashgangaon ke kaaran nirmit hote hai
 Objects orbiting a black hole continue to explore the gravitational field surrounding the central object
 1970 ke dashak main khoja gaya, ek purana udhaaharan he, ek prasiddh eksre strot signs X-1 ke liye jimmedaar kalpit blike hole ke ird-gird parikrama karti abhivruddhi discs
 Although the matter itself cannot be seen directly, the flickering of the x-ray continues in milliseconds, as expected just before accretion from a hot mass-like material orbiting around a black hole of about ten solar masses
 Is performed
 eksre spectrum us vishisht aakaar ko darshata he jisaki apeksha us discs se kii jaati he jisamen aurbiting relativistic padaarth hon, ek louh rekha ke saath or jise ~6
4 kev par utsarjit kiya gaya ho, tathaa laal or nile kii taraf chaudaa kiya gaya ho
 Another example is the S2 star which is seen orbiting the celestial center
 yah tara ~ 3
5 × 106 saura drabyaman vaale blike hole se kai prakaash ghanton kii duuri par he, isliye isaki parikraman gati ko ankit kiya ja saktaa he
 Nothing is visible in the center of the supervised orbit, as would be expected from a black object
 ardh-aavadhik dolan kaa istamaal blike hole ke dravyaman kaa nirdhaaran karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 This technique uses the relationship between the black hole and the inner part of its surrounding disks, where the gas continues to rotate inward before reaching the event horizon
 jaise hi gas kaa patan bheetar kii ore hota he, yah eksre vikiran prasaarit karata he jisaki tivrata ek nishchit kram se kam-zyada hoti rahati he or jo ek niyamit antaraal par khud ko doharaata rahata he
 This indicator is called half-period oscillation or QPO
 ek QPO kii aavriti blike hole ke dravyaman par nirbhar karti he; chote blike hole main ghatana kshitij nikat hi sthit hota he, isliye QPO kii aavriti ucch hoti he
 For black holes with greater mass, the event horizon is farther outward, so the QPO frequency is lower
 ab yah vyapak rup se sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki prayek akashganga ke, yaa lagbhag prayek, centre main ek ati vishalkay blike hole hota he
 The close correlation between the mass of this black hole and the rise of the host galaxy indicates that there is a deep correlation between the formation of the galaxy and the black hole
 dashakon tak, khagolavidon ne "sakriy akashganga" shabd kaa istemaal aisi akashgangaon kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya jinamein asaamaanya visheshtaayen hoti thi, jaise ki asaamaanya varnakrameey rekha utsarjan or ati shaktishaalee radio utsarjan
 However, theoretical and observational studies show that the galactic nuclei active in these galaxies may contain supermassive black holes
 in AGN ke modelon main ek kendriya blike hole hota he jo ki suraj se lakhon yaa arabon guna adhik baari ho saktaa he; ek gas or dhul kii discs jise abhivruddhi discs kehete hai; or do dharaaen jo abhivruddhi discs ke lambavat hoti hai
 Although it is expected that supermassive black holes will be found in almost all agns, the nuclei of only a few galaxies have been carefully studied in an effort to both identify and measure the actual mass of central supermassive black hole candidates
 Can be done
 aisi kuch ullekhneey akashgangaon ke udhaaharan hai, andromeda akashganga, M32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, or sombrero akashganga
 Astronomers believe that a supermassive black hole is located in the center of our own galaxy, in an area called Segitarius a *, because: 2002 main, habbal antarikshawya doorabeen ne jo avlokan prastut kiya ve sanket karte hai ki M15 or G1 naamak golakaar samoohon main madhyavarti-dravyaman vaale blike hole ke hone kii sambhaavna he
 This interpretation is based on the size and duration of the orbit of stars in spherical clusters
 lekin habbal saboot nirnaayak nahin he, kyonki neutron taron kaa ek samooh is tarah ke avlokanon kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Until recent discoveries, many astronomers thought that complex gravitational interactions in spherical clusters would expel newly formed black holes
 november 2004 main, khagolavidon kii ek team ne hamaari akashganga ke pratham or purnatah satyapit madhyavarti-dravyaman vaale blike hole kii khoj kii soochna di, jo segiterius A* se 3 prakaash varsh dur parikrama kar rahaa he
 This black hole, with a mass of 1300 solar masses, is in the middle of a group of seven stars, possibly a remnant of a massive star cluster that has fallen from the center of the Ganges
 yah avlokan is baat kii pushti karata he ki ati vishalkay blike hole aasapaas ke chote blike holon or taron ke avasorana dwaara apni vruddhi karte he
 In January 2007, researchers at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom reported the discovery of a black hole, possibly containing 10 solar masses and located in a galaxy called NGC 4472, at a distance of about 55 million light years
 hamaari akashganga main kai sambhavit taarakeey-dravyaman vaale blike hole shaamil hai, jo sagiterius A* kshetra ke ati vishalkay blike hole kii tulana main hamase adhik najadik hai
 All of these candidates are members of X-ray binary systems in which a more dense object draws substances from its partner through an accretion disk
 in jodon main blike hole teen se lekar ek darjan se zyada saura dravyamanon ke ho sakate hai
 The hitherto observable stellar mass black hole, Messia is a member of the binary system located in 33 galaxies
 siddhanthata ek blike hole ke liye koi nunatam aakaar tay nahin he
 Once they are created, they have the properties of black holes
 stephen hawking ne pratipaadit kiya ki atipraarambhik blike hole vashpit ho kar or bhi sookshm ho sakate hai, arthath sookshm blike hole
 The Fermi gamma-ray Space Telescope is being proposed for the discovery of a supermassive black hole that evaporates, which was launched on 11 June 2008
 haalaanki, agar sookshm blike hole kaa nirmaan duusare tareekon se ho saktaa he, jaise ki antarikshawya kiran ke prabhaav se yaa coliders main, iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki unhen nishchit rup se vashpit ho janaa chahie
 The formation of analogs of black holes in particle accelerators on Earth is reported
 ye blike hole anuroop gurutveey blike hole ke samaan nahin hote hai, lekin gurutv pramaatra siddhanton kii jaanch ke liye ye mahatvapurn hai
 They behave like black holes, which have nothing to do with gravity and the quantum theory of gravity, in line with the theory of strong nuclear power
 ve samaan hai kyonki donon string siddhant dwaara varnit kiye jate hai
 Therefore, the formation and dissolution of fire spheres in quark gluons plasma can be explained in the language of black holes

 For a more in-depth discussion, see: Particle collision protection in the Large Hadron Collider
 saamaanya saapekshata main aise vinyas kii sambhaavna kaa varnan kiya gaya he jisamen do blike hole ek duusare se jude hue hai
 Such a configuration is usually called a wormhole
 varmholon ne kalpit vigyaan kathaon ke lekhakon ko prerit kiya he kyonki ve ati lambi duuri kii yatraaon ko shighrata se tay karne kaa saadhan pradaan karte hai, time travel bhi
 In practice, such configurations are almost impossible in astrophysics, as no known process seems to allow the creation of these objects
 1971 main, stephen hawking ne dikhaaya ki paaramparik blike hole ke kisi bhi sangrah ke ghatana kshitij ke kul kshetra ko kam nahin kiya ja saktaa he, bhale hi ve aapas main takaraa kar ek duusare ko nigal len, arthath vilay ho jaae
 This is remarkably similar to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, where the field plays the role of entropy
 aisa mana jaataa tha ki shunya taapmaana hone kii vajah se blike hole kii entropy shunya hogi
 If this were the case, the entry of entropy-rich matter into the black hole would have violated the second law of thermodynamics, resulting in a decrease in the total entropy of the universe
 isliye, jacob bekensten ne prastaav rakhaa ki ek blike hole kii ek entropy chahie or ise ghatana kshitij kaa anupaatik hona chahie
 Since black holes traditionally do not emit radiation, the thermodynamic approach seems to be consistent, as zero temperature means infinite changes in entropy by any sum of heat, which means infinite entropy
 haalaanki, 1974 main, hawking ne ghatana kshitij ke paas pramaatra kshetra siddhant ko vakrit antariksh-samay par lagu kiya or paaya ki blike hole hawking vikiran chhodte hai, jo ek tarah kaa tapiya vikiran he or unru prabhaav se sambaddh he, jiskaa arth yah niklaa ki unamem ek saakaratmak taapmaana nihit he
 This reinforced the simulation between black hole dynamics and thermodynamics: using the first law of black hole mechanics, it can be concluded that the entropy of a non-rotating black hole will be one-fourth of the area of its event horizon 
 yah ek saarvbhaumik parinaam he or ise sampoorn brahmadia kshitij par lagu kiya ja saktaa he, jaise kii di citter antariksh kshetra main
 Later it was suggested that a black hole is an object with maximum entropy, that is, the maximum possible entropy of a single region of space would be the entropy of the largest black hole that can be contained in that region
 isaki vajah se holographic siddhant kii utpatti hui
 Hawking radiation refers to the specific temperature of a black hole, which can be calculated from its entropy
 taapmaana jitna giregaa, blike hole utana hi vishaal hota jaayegaa: jitani adhik urja avashoshit karegaa, utana hi adhik adhik thanda hota jaayegaa
 a black hole with approximately the mass of the planet Mercury has a temperature in equilibrium with celestial micro-wave radiation
 isse adhik baari hone par, ek blike hole prishthbhumi vikiran se adhik thanda ho jayega or yah hawking vikiran ke madhyam se utsarjit urja kii tulana main, prishthbhumi se zyada teji se urja praapt karegaa, isse bhi adhik thanda ho jaayegaa
 However, in a less massive black hole this effect would indicate that the mass of the black hole evaporates slowly over time, while the black hole will continue to heat up while doing so
 haalaanki ye prabhaav un blike hole ke liye naganya hai jo antarikshawya rup se gathit hone ke liye paryaapt rup se baari hai, ve kaalpanik chote blike hole ke liye badi teji se mahatvapurn ho jaayenge, jahaan pramaatra-yantric prabhaav haaavee hon
 In fact, small black holes will probably evaporate at a rapid rate and eventually disappear with an explosion of radiation
 haalanki saamaanya saapekshata kaa upyog kisi blike hole kii entropy kii gananaa hetu kiya ja saktaa he, yah sthiti siddhanthata santushti dene vaala nahin he
 In statistical mechanics, entropy is understood as the calculation of the number of microscopic configurations of a system that have similar microscopic properties
 lekin ek pramaatra gurutv ke santoshjanak siddhant ke bina, blike hole ke liye is prakaar kii gananaa karnaa sambhav nahin he
 However, little hope has been aroused by string theory, according to which the microscopic amount of freedom of a black hole is D-branes
 pradaan kiye gayi charge or urja dwaara di-brans kii avasthaaon kii gananaa karke, kuch khaas ati samamit blike hole ke utkram maap ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Extending the field of validity of these calculations is an ongoing area of research

 The Louville theorem describes the conservation of the phase space volume, which can be understood as "conservation of information", so there is a problem in established physics as well
 kwantum yantriki main, yah kendrikaran naamak ek mahatvapurn gun ke saath mail khaati he, jiskaa sambandh prayikta ke sangrakshan ke saath he 
 However, black holes can violate this rule

 It is necessary to emphasize that the equations of general relativity do in fact follow t-symmetry and that the fact that the above argument comes from the application of general relativity should be a bit cautious
 yah is tathy kii vajah se he ki time-cymetric siddhant dwaara time-reversal-acemmetric nishkarsh tak pahunchaana sambhav nahin he, jo is maamle main saamaanya saapekshata he
 Rindler coordinates, which are applied near the event horizon for an external viewer, are T-symmetric, so the existence of something like an "invariant" process can be ruled out
 yah sambhav he ki "virodhabhas" time-samamit siddhant par time-asamamit seemaa ko lagu karne kaa parinaam he, yah isko loshmit virodhabhas kaa ek prakaar banataa he
 Considerations of quantum gravity, on the other hand, suggest that there may only be a finite finite inverse measurement that will be related to the space near the horizon: but the change in the horizon's entropy and the Hawking radiation's entropy measure are sufficient Happens to contain all the transverse measurements of matter and energy that are falling into a black hole
 haalaanki kai bhautikeevidon kii yah chintaa he ki yah abhi bhi thik prakaar se samajha nahin ja sakaa he
 In particular, at a quantum level, the quantum state of Hawking radiation is determined only by what has previously fallen into the black hole; And the history of what had fallen into a black hole is determined solely by the quantum state of black hole and radiation
 yahi niyatatvvaad or kendrikaran kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 For a long time Stephen Hawking defied the idea, insisting on his original 1975 position that Hawking radiation is completely thermal, therefore completely disorganized, with no information of the material previously ingested by the black hole
 ; He argued that this information has been omitted
 haalaanki, 21 july 2004 main, unhone nayaa tark prastut kiya, apane pichley tark ke vipareet
 In this new calculation, the entropy measurement corresponding to the black hole passes out to the Hawking radiation
 haalaanki, ise siddhant main samaj paanaa bhi mushkil he, jab tak blike hole apana vashpikaran puraa na kar le
 Until then, it is impossible to establish a 1: 1 approach to Hawking radiation information and the initial state of the system
 ek baar jab blike hole puri tarah vashpit ho jaye, unki pahchaan kii ja sakati he or unamem hua kendrikaran sangrakshit rahata he
 By the time Hawking completed his calculations, it was quite clear by the ads / CFT relationship that black holes decay in a unitary way
 kyonki gej siddhanton main aag ke gole, jo hawking vikiran ke anuroop hai, nishchit rup se ekaatmak hai
 Hawking's new calculations have not been evaluated by the expert scientific community, because their methods are unintentional and of questionable conformity

 Leonard Saskind and Nobel Prize winner Gerard t Huft have suggested that the three-dimensional space around the black hole can be fully characterized by a two-dimensional behavior of the event horizon

 This idea has been adapted under string theory, and is known as holographic theory

 Over the past few decades, scientists, in new discoveries on the biological and cultural evolution of traditional belief, made it clear that they did not mean the physical power of any supernatural element, they found that belief in gods and goddesses included group members' cooperation, mental health and Supports the development of a feeling of affection

 The necessary procedure and standards followed by the courts while adjudicating civil lawsuits is called civil procedure
 aapraadhik mukademon main duusari prakriya lagu hoti he jise dand prakriya kehete hai
 The rules given in the civil procedure clearly state that- yadi kisi vyati ke adhikaron kaa kisi anya vyakti dwaara ulanghan kiya ja rahaa he to jis vyakti ke adhikaron kaa ulanghan ho rahaa he vah nyaayalay kii sharan jaataa he
 The court has its own procedure, from the start of any civil lawsuit to its disposal, because if this process is not done or is not certain, then there will be many problems and there can be extraordinary delay in settlement of the case
 aisi samasyaon se bachane ke liye hi civil prakriya samhita, 1908 paarit kii gayi thi
 In this, a clear written procedure has been laid down from the presentation of civil suit in the court to the disposal and execution of its decree thereafter
 civil prakriya samhita ke anusaar kisi sampatti se sambandhit yaa adhikaron se sambandhit vaad civil vaad yaa divaani vaad kehalaate hai
 In other words, a lawsuit that begins in two or more individuals over a private or public right is called a civil suit
 mote taur par civil vaadon ke antargat nimnlikhit vaad shaamil kiye jate hai- The combinatorial strength of the elements is named valency
 sanyojaktaa kaa yatharth gyaan hi samast rasayan shaastra kii neenv he
 In the last years, with the knowledge of the nature and properties of liquids, the knowledge of connectivity has also increased
 duusare shabdon main, sanyojaktaa ek sankhya he jo yah pradarshit karti he ki jab koi parmaanu kitne electron praapt karata he, yaa khota he yaa saajha karata he jab vah apane hi tatv ke parmaanu se yaa kisi anya tatv ke parmaanu se bandhan banaata he
 Around the mid-19th century, the British chemist Frankland and the German chemist Kolbe expressed their fantasies about connectivity
 francland ne pradarshit kiya ki acarbonic yogicon main praaia: ek kendriya tatv anya tatwon ke nishchit tulyankon se sanyog karata he
 For example, one atom of nitrogen, phosphorus and arsenic combines with three or five atoms of hydrogen and chlorine to form compounds
 is prakaar aisa prathit hota he ki sanyukt haanevaale tatwon kii sangyojanashkti sadaiv anya parmaanuon kii nishchit sankhya se santusht ho sakati he
 Therefore, if the valency of hydrogen is taken as a unit, the valency of an element will be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms with which the atom of that element can combine
 udaahranarth, chlorine, oxigen parmaanuon kii un sankhyaon ke baraabar hogi jinke saath us tatv kaa parmaanu sanyog kar saktaa he
 For example, one atom of chlorine, oxygen and carbon combines with one, two, three and four atoms respectively of hydrogen
 isliye chlorine, oxigen, nitrogen tathaa carbon kii sanyojaktaayen kramash: ek, do, teen tathaa chaar hai
 Some elements do not coincide with hydrogen
 aise tatwon kii sanyojaktaa, chlorine yaa oxigen kii sanyojaktaa ko kramash: ek yaa do maanakar, nikaali ja sakati he
 For example, one atom of thorium combines with four atoms of chlorine and two atoms of oxygen
 at: thorium kii sanyojaktaa chaar he
 Often the valency of the elements is shown by lines
 in rekhaon ko 'sanyojaktaa bandhan' kaha ja saktaa he
 The ideas of the famous organic chemist Kekule also resembled those of Frankland
 keval ek baat main donon main teevr matbhed tha
 As is evident from the above description, inorganic compounds often the valency of the same element may be different in different compounds
 udhaaharan ke liye, PCI3 tathaa PCI5 yogicon main phosphorus kii sanyojaktaa kramash: teen tathaa paanch he
 In contrast, in organic compounds, which are mostly made up of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, the valency of these elements is four, one, two and three, respectively, in stable and all organic compounds
 inaki sanyojaktaaon main saadharantaya kabhi antar nahin hota
 Having a clear knowledge of valency has helped chemists greatly in extracting the atomic mass of elements
 kisi bhi tatv kaa parmanubhaar uske tulyanki bhaar or sanyojaktaa ke gunanfal ke baraabar hoga
 Equivalent loads of elements can be easily extracted by experiments
 unnisvin shatabdi ke chauthe bhaag main, jab roosi mahan vaigyanik mendeleef ne aavart sarini kaa varnan kiya, to unhone saath hi saath us sarini main kisi tatv kii sthiti or uski sanyojaktaa kaa sambandh bhi suspasht kiya
 By placing the elements in the order of their atomic mass, each element exhibits similarity in physical and chemical properties with its eighth element
 is prakaar niskriy gaison ke avishkaar ke baad, vartmaan aavart sarini nau samoohon main bant jaati he
 The group of inert gases, such as helium, neon, ign, krypton, genon, and radon, is called the zero group, as these elements do not normally show cohesiveness to any other element
 aglaa samooh alkaili yaa kshareey dhaatuon kaa pratham samooh he or in sabaki sanyojaktaa bhi hydrogen, chlorine tathaa oxijan sab ke prati ek hoti he
 Similarly, the valency of elements of the second, third and fourth groups are two, three and four respectively
 paanchaven, chathe, saatven samooh ke tatv oxigen ke prati to kramash: paanch, chah tathaa saat sanyojaktaayen pradarshit karte hai, parantu hydrogen tathaa chlorine ke prati in samoohon ke tatwon kii sanyojaktaayen kramash: teen, do tathaa ek hai
 In the early period of the 20th century, scientist Sir J
J
 Tomson and Niels Burr, in order to increase our knowledge about the creation of atoms through experiments and their imaginations, Rutherford discussed the nucleus form of atoms
 iske anusaar prayek parmaanu ke centre yaa naabhi main bahut sookshm pind hota he, jisapar dhanavesh hota he or isi dhanavesh kii baraabar sankhya ke electron centre ke chaaron ore paridhiyon main chakkar lagaaya karte hai
 The electrons of the final periphery are named 'combinatorial electrons', because according to the 'electron theory of valency', these electrons determine the valence of the element
 udhaaharan ke liye, aavart talika ke pratham do samoohon ke parmaanuon kii rachana neeche di gai he : In the above table, atoms of inert gases have 8 electrons at the final periphery
 aisa prathit hota he ki yah vinyas itnaa sthaayee he ki ye swayan saadharantaya kisi rasinic kriya main bhaag nahin lete or anya tatv bhi ek, do, yaa teen electron khokar, yaa badhaakar, inhen ke vinyas ko praapt karne kii cheshtaa karte hai
 For example, the sodium atom forms sodium fluoride by losing one electron and the fluorine atom increases by one electron and in this action both the sodium and fluoride ions acquire the electron configuration of the inert gas neon
 is prakaar kii sanyojaktaa ko vidyut sanyojaktaa kaha jaataa he
 Compounds made of electronegativity are generally of high melting point and boiling point and are dissolved in water and are ionized
 is prakaar kii vidyutsanyojaktaa kii kalpana sarvapratham german rasayanajna cosel ne 1916 main kii thi
 Additionally, the American chemist Lewis conceived a few months later that in addition to the above method, some elements could obtain electron configuration of inert gases by another method
 is kalpana ke anusaar sanyog karanevaale do parmaanu kabhi kabhi apane ek, do, yaa teen electronon kaa saajha karke donon ke donon niskriy gaison kaa vinyas praapt kar lete hai
 This type of valency is called covalency, and the covalent compounds formed in it generally exhibit low melting and boiling points and are mostly soluble in organic solvents
 in donon ke atirikt ek anya prakaar kii sanyojaktaa kii kalpana kii gai he, jisamen ek yogic yaa tatva apane do khaali electron kisi duusare yogic yaa tatv ko dekar, donon main niskriy gaison ke electron vinyas kii avasthaa laa detaa he
 For example, ammonia provides two of its empty electrons, hydrogen or boron chloride, to give them an electron configuration of helium and neon, respectively
 is prakaar kii sanyojaktaa ko upasahsanyojaktaa kaha gaya he, kyonki is prakaar kii sanyojaktaa kii kalpana upasahsanyojak yogicon, jaise hexaamin, cobaltee chloride tathaa potacium pherocynide aadi ke gunon ko samajhane main bahut sahaayak siddh hui he
 The periodic table of elements, based on their electronic configuration, is the number of electrons present in the outermost orbit in an atom of an element
 tatwon kii sanyojaktaa kaa ek sanket detii he: The speed of light is a physical constant

 prakaash ke veg samay yatra main sahaayak he
 According to Einstein's special theory of relativity, if the speed of light is compared at a relative speed, time will be different than that of a stationary observer
 21 oktober 1983, se prakaash ke veg kaa maan meter sahit anya maapkon ko 'calibratt' karne ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 Its value is related to the vacuum's electric constant ε 0 { \ displaystyle \ varepsilon _ {0} \ , \ !} And the magnetic constant μ 0 { \ displaystyle \ mu _ {0} \ , \ !} Which is as follows: satrahavin sadi ke madhya tak dharna yah thi ki prakaash kaa veg anant hota he, arthath use ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par pahunchne main kuch bhi samay nahin lagata
 Galileo attempted to measure the speed of light, but in his experiment, he failed to measure the speed of light due to human-reaction error
 In September 1676 Roemer stated that the velocity of light is 'finite' despite being intense
 brihaspati ke ek upgrah, io, ke grahanon ke antar kaal main prithvi se sambandhit duuri ke badalane se hone vaale parivartan kaa adhyayan kar, romar ne prakaash ko prithvi kii kaksha ke vyas ko paar karne main laganevaale kaal ko nikaalane kaa tarika sujhaayaa| haalanki, us tareeke ke aadhaar par gananaa karne vaale pehle vyakti chrischian huygens the, jo 2,14,300 kilometre prati second ke baraabar gyaat hua, phir bhi prakaash kii gati nikaalane vaale vyakti ke rup main romar ko hi shri miltaa he

 Adi Shakti made him dumb to stop the evil desires of the demon, and when God appeared in front of him he could not ask for anything from them
 At this, he became angry and started harassing Kol Maharishi who was worshiping Adi Shakti to get free
 The Adi Shakti who defeated the demon was praised by the gods as Mookambika

 Yes, it proves that either Gaudapada was not an interviewed disciple of Shuk or he was not an interviewed Guru of Govindapada
 goudpad shuk ke saakshaat shishy the yaa nahin iskaa nirnay karnaa asambhav he
 It does not seem appropriate to prove the historicity of Gaudapada in the ancient Puranas
 yadi govindpad ko godpad kaa saakshaat shishy bhi maan len to bhi kai kathinaaiyaan hai
 Shankaracharya's time is often considered to be late 8th century AD
 yadi un dinon ke saamaanya jeevankaal ko 100 varsh kaa bhi maan len to goudpad ko saatvin shatabdi main maananaa padegaa
 But Bhavaviveka or Bhavya, a Buddhist Acharya of the sixth century, in his treatise Madhyamahrya, while discussing Vedanta philosophy, has quoted a story of Gaudapada
 isse yah gyaat hota he ki bhavy ke pehle hi goudpad vedant ke acharya ke rup main pratishthit ho chuke the
 Therefore, the time of Gaudapada should be around 500 AD
 yadi yah sahi he to goudpad govindpad ke saakshaat guru nahin ho sakate
 Shankaracharya has remembered Gaudapada by saying "vedantavidvabhirachayen:"
 pro walesar ne likhaa he ki "goudpad" shabd main prayukt "goud" shabd deshparak he, yah vyaktivishesh kaa naam nahin he
 Advaita Vedanta had two departures - the first Gaud departure which was prevalent in North India and the second Dravid departure, which was founded by Shankar himself
 walesar ke anusaar "goudpad" shabd kaa arth he - goud desh main prachlit vedantashastraparak padshtushtyaatmak granth
 But there is no firm basis for such a far-fetched imagination
 vidhushekhar bhattacharya ne thik hi kaha he ki yadi hamen ek granth praapt hota he to us granth kaa koi ne koi lekhak hona chahie
 On the basis of intimate examination, it can be firmly asserted that all the four episodes of this book of Gaudapada belong to the same author
 parampara is granth ke lekhak ko goudpad naamak vyakti vishesh ko hi granth kaa lekhak maananaa padegaa
 Balakrishnananda Saraswati of the 17th century wrote in a treatise called "shareerak Mimamsa Bhashya Vartik" that some Gaud people lived on the banks of Hiranyavati river in Kurukshetra
 goudpad unheen main se ek the
 But his real name could not be known to the people due to his trance since the beginning of Dwapar
 is anushruti ki aadhaar par goudpad ko kurukshetra ke aasapaas kaa hona chahie
 According to the treatise 'agadguru Ratnamalastava', Gaudapada had contact with the Greeks
 acharya ne inaki puja kii or nishaksiddh aplunya inkaa shishy tha
 There is a great controversy among Greek historians about whether Apollonius came to India and most scholars believe that Apollonius had never visited India
 inhen suni sunai baton ke aadhaar par hi bharat kaa varnan kar diya tha
 Apart from this, there is no mention of Gaudapada in the Greek texts and Bharatavarnas of Apollonius
 goudpad ke vyaktitv ke bare main iske alaava ki ve ek yogi or siddh purush the tathaa gudpadiya karikaon ke karta the, kuch bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Gourmet works are in front of us
 in karikaon ko chaar prakarnon main vibhajit kiya gaya he or ye ek hi vyakti kii kriti hai
 Its first episode is called Agama Case
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki is prakaran main manducya upanishad kaa karikamay vyaakhyaan upasthit kiya gaya he
 Agama means it is called Agama Case because it is based on Upanishads
 kuch acharya is prakaran kii karikaon ko "aagam" kehete hai or inako goudpad kii kriti nahin maanate
 Sometimes these karis are combined with the Mandukya Upanishad
 vidhushekhar bhattacharya kaa to kahana he ki ye karikas pehle likhi gayi thim or baad main inhen ke aadhaar par manducya upanishad kii rachana hui
 But this opinion is not rational
 iskaa pramaan is prakaran kii karikaon se hi miltaa he
 These roles are explanatory
 at: manducya upanishad hi inase pehle kaa maaloom padataa he
 In the second episode, the viability or falsity of the world is proved, so its name is the case of Vaitathya
 advait tatv kaa pratipaadan hone ke kaaran teesraa prakaran advait prakaran kehalaata he
 Allatshanti has been called because of the rendering of peace of all false disputes
 vidhushekhar bhattacharya kaa mat he ki ye chaaro prakaran chaar swatantra rachanaayen hai, kisi ek granth ke chaar adhyay nahin, kyonki ye paraspar sambandhit nahin hai
 Also at the beginning of the fourth episode, "tanda vande dvaipadambaram" has been called as the praise of Buddha
 mangalacharan granth ke aarambh main kiya jaataa he, bich main prakaran ke aarambh main mangalacharan nahin dekha gaya he
 Thus, Chaturvakaran is an independent book
 yah mat kuch thik nahin lagata kyonki pehali baat to yah he ki chaaron prakaran ek duusare se sambandhit hai
 In the first case, some principles have been introduced broadly on the basis of the Upanishads, and in the second and third cases, respectively, the falsehood of the world and the state of an invisible element are presented respectively
 chauthaa prakaran upsanhaaratmak he jisamen purvokt teen prakarnon main kahe gaye upanishad anumodith siddhanton kaa buddha dwaara updisht siddhanton se avirodh dikhalaayaa gaya he
 On the basis of this episode, Bhattacharya has called Gaudapada a Buddhist, but if he can be called a Buddhist on the basis of one episode, then he can also be declared Mahavedanti on the basis of the first three episodes
 yah sahi he ki goudpad ke siddhant baudhon ke nikat hai
 Their casteism is based on the secondary method
 inke dwaara pratipaadit aatma kaa swaroop yogacharanumat vigyaan kii anukriti sa maaloom padataa he
 Their rationale is the same as that of secondary nihilists
 unhone buddha kaa bada aadar kiya he
 Despite all this, Gaudapada is pure Vedanti, because - is prasang main yah dhyaan dena avashyak he ki goudpad na to keval madhyamik siddhaton ke anuyaayi hai or na shuddhat: yogachaar darshan ke
 Where he found logical reasoning, he received it
 unhone sarvada yah dikhaane kaa praytn kiya ki buddha vichaardhaara or aupnishadik vichaardhaara main tatvat: koi virodh nahin he
 What is opposed is ignorant
 goudpad kii bhartiya darshan ko dein he
 Shankaracharya adopted this path of co-ordination and established his Advaita faith, but his original philosophy was Gaudpadi
 isi kaaran goudpad apana avirodh darshan pratishthapit karne ke liye hi buddha ko namaskara karte hai at: yah namaskara mangalacharan ke rup main nahin granth ke pratipaadya vishay ke rup main sweekrut kiya janaa chahie
 In this philosophy it seems that logic is not given as much space as interview and experience
 yoga kaa maarg hi pramukh maarg he at: us maarg main tarkjanya virodh ko koi sthaan nahin hona chahie
 Just as the word "paad" comes at the end of the names of the Siddhas - Gunduripa, Sirhapa etc
 - Similarly, the use of the word Paad in Gaudapada's name also points to the association of Gaudapada with the Siddhas
 sarhapaad ke dohon tathaa goudpad kii karikaon main samanta bhi darshneey he
 May be Gaudapada is the link between Buddhist and non-buddhist cults
 is karikagranth ke atirikt sankhyakarika ke upar bhashya bhi goudpad kaa mana jaataa he
 His compositions are also called Uttaragitabhashya, Nrisinhapatini Upanishad and Durgasaptashati's commentary, Subhagodaya and Srividyaratnasutra

 The original name of "dammam" is controversial, with some saying the sound is imitative, and the area was given this name due to a drum being placed near the area, when it was used instead of a warning
 The melodious sound emanated from what was called "damdamah", others believe that the name is derived from the Arabic word "dawama", which used to indicate a nearby maritime site that often washed away people

 insulin ke prati sharir kii pratikriya main bhinnata hoti he, yah ek sujan purv sthiti he or isamen thrombosis hone kii ek badi pravriti hoti he 
 Decades ago, certain amounts of obesity were considered a sign of personal and family prosperity: "calories were rare, physical exertion was high, and people were thin like greyhounds
 " vishesh rup se, ek dubli-patali shaadishuda aurat dayaa kii paatr hoti thi, kyonki uskaa aakaar yah darshata he ki uskaa pati use paryaapt bhojan nahin de paata he; iske vipareet, patni kaa motaa hona vyakti ke liye vaibhav-pratik mana jaataa tha; or yah darshata tha ki unke paas paryaapt maatra main bhojan he or use kaam bhi nahi karnaa padataa

 Although excess weight was "unacceptable" in contemporary Western society for some time, it is now becoming more acceptable as more and more people are becoming overweight and obese
 america main rahane vaali mahilaon ke bich motopa saamaajik rup se adhik sweekaarya hota ja rahaa he, kyonki washington times ke iconomik anquayri kii akhya ke anusaar, 20 se adhik kii umr vaali mahilaon main se ek-tihaai mahilaayein moti hai
 For this study, Frank Helland, associate professor of economics at Florida State University's Center for Demography and Population Health, and Mary Burke, senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, analyzed data from the cdc's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
 shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki 30 or 60 varsh kii aayu ke bich kii mahilaon kaa ausat vajan 1976 se 20 pound yaa 14% badha tha
 Researchers also found that there was an 18% increase in women who were over 300 pounds or overweight
 shodhakartaaon ne yah bhi paaya ki swayan kii chhavi main badlaav aayaa he or yah ki sanyukt rajya america main motopa saamaajik rup se or adhik sweekaarya ho gaya he
 According to the study, an average woman weighed 147 pounds in 1994 but also made it clear that she wanted to gain 132 pounds
 adhyayan main yah bhi paaya gaya ki 2002 tak, ek ausat mahila kaa vajan 153 pound tha lekin unhone kaha ki ve 135 pound kaa vajan praapt karnaa chaahati thim
 Researchers also found that "the fact that women's desired weight gain has increased indicates that there is less social pressure to lose weight"
 kyonki sharir ko vasa banane ke liye urja vyay karne kii jarurat hoti he, isliye vajan kam karne ke liye ek vyakti ko urja kii jitani maatra vyay kerani padati he vah vajan badhaane ke liye khapat kii jane vaali maatra kii tulana main bas thodi si kam hoti he
 There are countless mechanisms in the body that manage metabolic rate affecting weight loss and weight gain
 is prakaar, vajan main vaastavik parivartan alag-alag vyaktiyon main bhinn hota he
 In addition, the above computation assumes that all the weight that is increased and decreased is in the form of fat
 hakeekat main, yah protein, carbohydrate, aadi kaa ek mishran he 
 Consider the following theoretical calculations
 saanchaa:symptoms concerning nutrition, metabolism and development The meaning of saints literature in this article is that literature which is composed by devotees
 yah aavashyak nahin ki sant use hi kaha jaae jo nirgun brahm kaa upaask ho
 Under this, all the sattpurushis of Lokmangalvadhyayi come, but modern writers have given the title of "saint" to the devotees of Nirguniyya and now the word has started in the same category
 "sant" shabd sanskrit "sat" ke prathama kaa bahuvachananth rup he, jiskaa arth hota he sajjan or dharmik vyakti
 The word for sage men in Hindi came into practice
 kabir, surdaas, goswami tulsidas aadi puraane kaviyon ne is shabd kaa vyavhaar sadhu or paropkaaree, purush ke arth main bahulansh: kiya he or uske lakshan bhi die hai
 It is not necessary for a philanthropist saint to be a scholar and linguist
 uskaa lokahitkar kaary hi uske santatv kaa maandand hota he
 In Hindi litterateurs, who were "nirguniye saints", most of the illiterate Kinnas were under-educated
 shastreey gyaan kaa aadhaar na hone ke kaaran aise log apane anubhav kii hi baaten kehane ko baadhya the
 Therefore, in their limited experience there may be many such things, which will be contrary to the scriptures
 alpashikshit hone ke kaaran in santon ne vishay ko hi mahatv diya he, bhashaa ko nahin
 Their language is often rough and panchrangi
 kavy main bhaavon kii pradhanta ko yadi mahatv diya jaae to sachhee or khari anubhutiyon kii sahaj evam saadharanokrut abhivyakti ke kaaran in santon main kaiyon kii bahuveri rachanaayen uttam koti ke kavy main sthaan paane kii adhikarini maani ja sakati he
 They do not blindly support every charity donated by tradition
 inke chintan kaa aakaar sarvamanavvaad he
 These humans do not believe in any kind of difference between humans
 inkaa kahana he ki koi bhi vyakti apane kulvishesh ke kaaran kisi prakaar vaishishty liye hue utpann nahin hota
 In their eyes, the specialty should be taken with two things: obedient benevolence or public service and godliness
 is prakaar swatantra chintan ke kshetra main in santon ne ek prakaar kii vaicharik kranti ko janm diya
 From the point of view of human welfare, the kind of religious thoughts and feelings published by the Nirguniyya saints, ideas and experiences had started getting place in old Hindi from long ago
 vikram kii naveen shatabdi main buddha sidhon ne jo rachanaayen prastut kin unamem vajrayan tathaa sahajayan sambandhi sampradayik vichaaron evam saadhnaaon ke upanysan ke saath-saath anya sampradaay ke vichaaron kaa pratyaakhyaan baraabar miltaa he
 The same sentiment seems to work in the bhanis of Nathpanthi yogis and Jain sages
 baudhon main paramatma yaa ishwar ko sthaan praapt na tha, nathpanthiyon ne apane vachanon main ishwartv kii pratishtha kii
 Policy has a prominent place in all these compositions
 ye jagah-jagah lok ko upadesh dete hue dikhaai padate hai
 When Hindi developed after Old Hindi, then the influence of earlier literature inevitably had an impact on it
 isiilie hindi ke adikaal main dohon main jo rachanaayen milti hai unamem se adhikansh upadeshparak evam nitiparak hai
 There are also some in those couplets in which the soul of poetry is seen as glaring
 kintu itane se hi use kavy nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The emergence of saint tradition must be considered since the late fifteenth century Vikrami
 in santon kii baniyon main vichaarswatantry kaa swar pramukh rahaa vaishnav dharm ke pradhan acharya ramanuj, ninvark tathaa madhv vikram kii barahavin evam terahavin shatee main hue
 Through them, a ferocious stream of devotion emerged
 in aacharyon ne prasthaantrayee par jo bhashya prastut kiye, bhakthi ke vikaas main unka pramukh yoga he
 Some hindrance to the path of devotion was definitely present due to the promotion of the miracle-oriented yoga route from Gorakhnath, to which Goswami Tulsidas has also indicated: tathaapi vah uttarottar viksit hoti gai
 The same resulted in the birth of Sant Jayadeva in Utkal, the famous saint of the Varkari sect in Maharashtra [[namdev and Gyanadeva, saint Sadhana and Beni in the west and Sant Laldev in Kashmir
 in santon ke baad prasiddh sant ramanand kaa pradurbhaav hua, jinaki shikshaaon kaa jansamaj par vyapak prabhaav padaa
 It is a historically true that when the flow of a developed ideology is blocked and supported by another ideology, then along with the rational refutation of its principles, some popular and popular features of its ideology are also made subjective
 jagadguru shankar, raghavanand, ramanuj, ramanand aadi sabaki drushti yahi rahi he
 Nathpanth had an influence on the community, he had become a liberal
 vyapak lokdarshan ke falswaroop swami ramanand kii drushti or bhi udaar ho gai thi
 That is why the inclusion of Julahe, Raidas, Nai, Dom, etc
 is seen in his direct or indirect disciples
 is kaal main jo satyabhiniveshi bhakt yaa sadhu hue unhone sat ke grahapurvak asat par nirgam prahaar bhi kiye
 Due to the lack of realization of the emblem-oriented method of religion of ancient times, the satirical eloquence of saints like Kabir appeared attractive
 in santon main bahuton ne apane satkartavya kii itishree apane naam se ek nayaa "panth" nikaalane main samajhi
 Their collective humanist vision was plagued by parochialism
 is prakaar solahavin shatabdi se unnisvin shatabdi tak naanaa panth ek ke baad ek astitv main aate gaye
 The Sikh era Adi Nanakdev gave birth to Nanakpanth, Dadu Dayal Dadupanth, Kabirdas gave Kabirpanth, Bawri Bawarist, Haridas gave rise to Niranjani sect and Malukdas gave birth to Malukpant
 aage chalakar babalalji sampradaay, dhaani sampradaay, saath sampradaay, dharanishwari sampradaay, dariyaadasi sampradaay, dariyapanth, shivnarayani sampradaay, garibpanth, ramasanehi sampradaay aadi naanaa prakaar ke panthon evam sampradaayon ke nirmaan kaa shrey un santon ko he jinhone satyadarshan evam lokopkaar kaa vrath le rakhaa tha or baad main sankeernata ko gale lagaaya
 The saints who preached the worship of Nirguna Brahman were adamant to see Rama, Krishna etc
 as ordinary human beings, they themselves started worshiping themselves like Rama and Krishna
 sampradyposhakon ne apane aadi guru ko ishwar yaa paramatma siddh karne ke liye naanaa prakaar kii kalpit aakhyayikaaye garh daaleen
 This is the reason that the circles of all those Nirguniyya saints remained closed in the box of their creed or sect
 idhar sahitya main jab se shodhakarya ne bal paaya he tab se sahityagranthon ke katipay prishthon main unki charchaa ho jaati he, jansamanya se unka koi sampark nahin rah gaya he
 Two sects were also seen in these sects, who in their life gave priority to devotion but to karma
 sattnami sampradaywaalon ne mughal samrat aurangzeb ke viruddh vidroh kaa jhanda upar laharaaya tha 
 The ninth Guru of Nanakpanth, Shri Govind Singh, ended his sect as an army
 isi santaparampara main aage chalakar radhaswami sampradaay astitv main aayaa
 This saint tradition has lasted till Rammohan Roy, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Swami Ramatirtha
 mahatma gandhi ko is parampara kii antim kadi kaha ja saktaa he
 As has been said earlier, the majority of these sects and creeds, Adi Guru were illiterate
 at: ve maukhik rup main apane vichaaron or bhaavon ko prakat kiya karte the
 The disciple used to remember him
 aage chalakar unheen upadeshaatmak kathanon ko shishyon dwaara lipibaddh kar liya gaya or vahi unka dharmagranth ho gaya
 Somewhere in the collection of these statements and words, the idea of good and common poetry is also found
 at: in padyakaar santon main katipay aise sant bhi hai jo mukhyat: sant hote hue bhi gaunat: kavi bhi isamen kaiyon ne apni shastreey shiksha ke abhaav ko bahushrutata dwaara dur karne kaa prayaas avashya kiya he, yah bhi darshan ke kshetra main, sahitya ke kshetra main nahin
 Many of them did not even get to know the nature of literature, but the intensity of their experience attracts the mind of any emotional person
 aise santon main kabir kaa sthaan pramukh he
 Without considering the religious traditions and orthodox beliefs of both Hindus and Muslims, with foresight, the sarcastic attack they made and proclaimed themselves to be monastic and truthful to all sages, the lower class of society could not remain unaffected and modern foreign civilization Dixit and some people who are proud of Indian civilization and culture, in it true humanity Security had to hear the message
 rabindranath thakur ne brahmasamaji vichaaron se mail khaane ke kaaran kabir kii baniyon kaa angreji anuwaad prastut kiya or usase aaajeevan prabhavit bhi rahe
 Kabir is composed mainly in sakhis and curtains
 inamen unki swanubhootiyaan teevr rup main saamaane ai hai
 The first saint of Hindi in saint tradition is Jayadeva
 ye gitgovindkar jayadev se bhinn hai
 Sadhana, Trilochan, Namdev, Sen Bhai, Raidas, Pippa, Dhanna, Nanakdev, Amardas, Dharmadas, Dadudayal, Bashna ji, Bawri Sahiba, Garibdas, Sundardas, Dariyadas, Dariya Saheb, Sahajo Bai etc
 are the major saints of this tradition

 His hallmark is the hallmark of a committed and vigorous Marxist revolutionary poet, eager to build a better society

 For social change, for building a better society
 isiilie unhone shabdon ko taraasha he

 avastai ek purvi irani bhashaa he jiskaa gyaan aadhunik yug main keval parsi dharm ke granthon, yani avastaa, ke dwaara pahunch paaya he
 Historians believe that this language or its dialects were spoken in the period of 1500–1100 BCE in the Yaz culture located in the Bactria and Margu regions of Central Asia
 kyonki yah ek dharmik bhashaa ban gai, isliye is bhashaa ke saadhaaran jivan se lupt hone ke pashchaat bhi iskaa prayog nae granthon ko likhane ke liye hota rahaa
 Written compositions of only two Iranian languages of the era 1500 BC have been found
 ek "pracheen avastai" he jo uttarpurv main boli jaati thi or ek "pracheen farsi" he jo dakshin-pashchim main boli jaati thi
 Among Iranian languages, it is a major division of Eastern Iranian languages and Western Iranian languages
 armbh main keval ek "aadim hind-irani bhashaa" thi - isi se hind-irani bhashaa parivaar kii sabhi bhashaayen janmi hai, jinamein sanskrit, hindi, kashmiri, farsi, pashto sabhi shaamil hai
 Ancient Avastai is the language of the era when Eastern Iranian languages and Vedic Sanskrit were very similar
 pashchimi irani bhashaaon main kuch badlaav aa rahe the jis se vah vaidic sanskrit se thodi bhinn ho chuki thi
 It can be said that the ancient avastai was between these two - it is very similar to Vedic Sanskrit and it is also similar to ancient Persian
 avastai bhashaa main rachanaayen kam hai isliye avastai shabd-vyakaran samajhane ke liye bhashavaigyanik vaidic sanskrit kaa pehle adhyayan kar uski sahaayta lete hai kyonki avastai or vaidic sanskrit main is kshetra main nikat kaa sambandh he
 In the 19th century, Western scholars had a new look at both Avastai and Vedic Sanskrit, and the fact of their deep relationship was soon revealed to them
 unhone dekha ke avastai farsi or vaidic sanskrit ke shabdon main kuch saral niyamon ke saath ek se dusre ko anuvaadit kiya ja saktaa tha or vyakaran kii drushti se yah donon bahut nazadik the
 In his book "comparison of Avastai Grammar with Sanskrit and the Avastai alphabet and its transliteration" published in 1892, the linguist and scholar Abraham Jackson, for example, directly translated an Avatai's religious verse into Vedic Sanskrit - avastai kii apni "pahalavi" lipi thi or uskaa istemaal ab parsi dharmik prayogon ko chhodkar lupt ho chukaa he
 It is written from right to left like Persian and ancient Indian script Kharoshthi
 isamen 13 mul akshar the jinke avastai main 53 bhinn rup prayog hote the
 These characters were based on the Aramai script, from which all modern scripts of India have also originated
 bharat main sthit parsi samudaay ke log prachinkaal main avastai ko brahmi par aadhaarit lipiyon main bhi likhte the

 free state • khouteng • kwazulu-natal • limpopo • ampumalanga • pashchimottar • uttari kep • Bharatendu Harishchandra is known as the father of modern Hindi literature
 ve hindi main aadhuniktaa ke pehle rachanaakaar the
 His original name was 'harishchandra', 'bharatendu' was his title
 unka kaarykaal yug kii sandhi par khadaa he
 He adopted the land of healthy tradition and sowed the seeds of innovation, leaving the nutritious practices of the perverted feudal culture of Reetikal
 hindi sahitya main aadhunik kaal kaa prarambh bharatendu harishchandr se mana jaataa he
 Bharatenduji, famous as the forerunner of the Indian renaissance, made the aim of his literature depicting the poverty, subjugation, inhuman exploitation of rulers of the country
 hindi ko raashtra-bhashaa ke rup main pratishthit karne kii disha main unhone apni pratibha kaa upyog kiya
 Bharatendu was rich in versatility
 hindi patrakarita, naatak or kavy ke kshetra main unka bahumoolya yogadan rahaa
 The beginning of plays in Hindi is believed to be from Bharatendu Harishchandra
 bharatendu ke naatak likhane kii shuruyaat bangala ke vidyasundar naatak ke anuwaad se hoti he
 Although plays were written even before them, Bhartendu strengthened the foundation of Hindi drama by regularly writing several plays in Khadiboli
 unhone 'harishchandra chandrika', 'kavivachansudha' or 'bala bodhini' patrikaon kaa sampadan bhi kiya
 He was an outstanding poet, strong satirist, successful playwright, conscious journalist and vigorous prose
 iske alaava ve lekhak, kavi, sampadak, nibandhkaar, evam kushal vaktaa bhi the
 Bharatendu ji wrote a huge literature at a young age of only thirty-four years
 unhone maatra or gunvattta kii drushti se itnaa likhaa or itani dishaao main kaam kiya ki unka samoochaa rachanakarm pathdarshak ban gaya
 Bharatendu Harishchandra was born on September 9, 1850 in a prestigious Vaishya family of Kashi
 unke pita gopalchandra ek achche kavi the or 'giradhardaas'upnaam se kavita likhaa karte the
 At the time of the first Indian freedom struggle in 1857, he would be 7 years old
 ye din unki aankh khulne ke the
 Bharatendu's work is evidence that once his eyes were opened, he did not stop
 unke purvaj angrej bhakt the, unki hi krupa se dhanwaan huye the
 Harishchandra was five years old, his mother died and ten years old, his father died
 is prakaar bachapan main hi mata-pita ke sukh se vanchit ho gayi
 Vimata tortured a lot
 bachapan kaa sukh nahin mila
 The system of education continued for the first time
 samvedansheel vyakti ke naate unamem swatantra rup se dekhne-sochane-samajhane kii aadat kaa vikaas hone laga
 His mind kept getting troubled by the content and method of studies
 queens college, banaras main pravesh liya, teen-chaar varshon tak college aate-jate rahe par yahan se man baar-baar bhaagta rahaa
 The memory power was intense, the eclipse ability amazing
 isliye parikshaon main uteern hote rahe
 In those days in Benares, English-educated and famous writer - King Shivprasad was 'starshind', Bharatendu used to go to his disciple
 unheen se angreji sikhi
 Bhartendu learned Sanskrit, Marathi, Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi, Urdu languages from Swadhyay
 unako kavy-pratibha apane pita se viraasat ke rup main mili thi
 He narrated to his father by making the following couplet at the age of five years and received the blessings of being a poet
 dhan ke atyadhik vyay se bhaaratendu ji rini ban gaye or duschintaaon ke kaaran unka sharir shithil hota gaya
 As a result, he died in 1885 at an early age
 bharatendu ke vrahat saahitiyik yogadan ke kaaran hi 1857 se 1900 tak ke kaal ko bharatendu yug ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 According to Acharya Ramchandra Shukla, pandrah varsh kii avasthaa se hi bhaaratendu ne sahitya seva prarambh kar di thi
 At the age of eighteen, he brought out a magazine called 'kavikavasudha', in which the writings of the great scholars of that time were printed
 ve bees varsh kii avasthaa main onreri magistrate banaae gaye or aadhunik hindi sahitya ke janak ke rup me pratishthit hue
 She published 'kavikavasudha' in 1868, 'harishchandra Magazine' in 1873 and 'bala Bodhini' for women's education in 1874
 saath hi unke samaantar saahitiyik sansthaayen bhi khadi kin
 He founded the 'tadiya Samaj' to promote Vaishnava devotion
 rajbhakti prakat karte hue bhi, apni deshbhakti kii bhaavana ke kaaran unhen angreji hukumat kaa kopbhaajan bananaa padaa
 Impressed by his popularity, the scholars of Kashi conferred him the title of 'bharatendu' in 1880
 hindi sahitya ko bharatendu kii dein bhashaa tathaa sahitya donon hi kshetron main he
 In the field of language, he distinguished the form of Khadi dialect which is different from Urdu and has been enhanced by taking the juice of the dialects of Hindi region
 isi bhashaa main unhone apane sampoorn gadhy sahitya kii rachana kii
 Along with literature service, social service of Bharatendu ji also continued
 unhone kai sansthaaon kii sthapana main apana yoga diya
 He considered it his duty to help the afflicted, literate and friends
 pramukh nibandh Amazing dream ek kahani- kuch aapbeetee, kuch jagabiti It was the specialty of Bharatendu ji that where he wrote poems on ancient subjects like devotion to God, he also adopted new subjects like social reform, national love etc
 bhaaratendu kii rachanaaon main angreji shashan kaa virodh, swatantraaa ke liye uddaam aakanksha or jaateey bhavabodh kii jhalak milti he
 It was a new thing at that time to try to organize people for the spread of modern consciousness in a society stuck in feudal tightness
 unke sahitya or naveen vichaaron ne us samay ke tamaam sahityakaron or buddhijiviyon ko jhakzora or unke ird-gird rashtriya bhaawanaaon se ot-prot lekhakon kaa ek aisa samooh ban gaya jise bharatendu mandal ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 According to the subject, his poem is Shringar-dominated, Bhakti-dominated, social problem-oriented and national love-oriented
 shringaar ras pradhanbharatendu ji ne shringaar ke sanyog or viyog donon hi pakshon kaa sundar chithran kiya he
 See a picture of disconnection- bhakthi pradhanbharatendu ji krishna ke bhakt the or pushti maarg ke maanane vaale the
 He has a vision of true devotional spirit in the poem
 ve kaamana karte hai - Social problem Pradhan Bhartendu ji depicted many social problems in his poetry
 unhone samaaj main vyaapt kuritiyon par tikhe vyangy kiye
 They did not leave even the moneylenders and the bribe takers - raashtra-prem pradhanbharatendu ji ke kavy main raashtra-prem bhi bhaavana spasht drushtigochar hoti he
 They present the tableau of India's ancient glory in these words - prakritik chitranprakruti chithran main bhaaratendu ji ko adhik safalataa nahin mili, kyonki ve maanav-prakruti ke shilpi the, bahya prakruti main unka marmpurna roopen nahin ram paaya
 Hence, most of his nature depiction lacks the power to attract the human heart
 chandravali naatika ke yamuna-varnan main avashya sajivta he tathaa uski upamaayen or utprekshaayen naveenta liye hue hai- See this example of the nature description, in which the beauty of Yamuna is very visible
 bharatendu ke samay main rajkaaj or sambhraant varg kii bhashaa farsi thi
 At the same time, the dominance of English was also increasing
 sahitya main brajabhasha kaa bolbalaa tha
 Persian influenced Urdu also came into vogue
 aise samay main bharatendu ne lokbhashaon or farsi se mukt urdu ke aadhaar par khadi boli kaa vikaas kiya
 The Hindi we write today is a gift of Bharatendu
 yahi kaaran he ki unhen aadhunik hindi kaa janak mana jaataa he
 Not only the language, he incorporated new modern consciousness in literature and associated literature with 'jan'
 bharatendu kii rachanadharmita main doharaapan dikhataa he
 While he continued to write poetry in the Braj language, he tried his hand in other genres in a standing bid
 sahi myne main kahen to bhaaratendu aadhunik khadi boli gadhy ke unnayak hai
 The language of poetry of Bharatendu is mainly Braj language
 unhone braj bhashaa ke aprachlit shabdon ko chhod kar uske parikrisht rup ko apanaaya
 Urdu and English are also widely used words in their language
