 There are many reasons people use the practice of food offerings
 kuch karne ke liye pyaar kaa izhaar he, yaa baatcheet yaa devataaon dhanyavad kar rahe hai

 The dough lamp only partially baked and then eaten

 Cooking as a sacred ritual The cooking as a sacred ritual of the last decade has increased in South Kerala, almost exclusively by women
 This practice, called 'pongala', seems to have been associated with the historic moving city temple Attukal in Thiruvananthapuram which was begotten by the Tamil tradition
 abhilekhon kaa naam ginis book ke mutabik, Attukal Pongala duniya main mahilaon kii sabase badi sabha he pongala kii mahila pratibhaagiyon ke aane ke khaanaa pakaane ke bartan, sookhe eendhan or saamagree ke saath susajjit he
 Set your hearths around the temple such as rice flour, palm sugar and spices, often last evening, and on the morning of the festival day

 2009 main, mahilaon kii anumaanit sankhya 2
5 million jo bhaag liya tha
 The women waited till the Attukal Temple ceremoniously distributed the fire and set about their cooking when the fire reached them passed from the stove to the stove
 They go home with prasad cooked till late afternoon
 While men are not allowed in the area, they help in providing my support for women coming from outside and departing and organizing free drinks by organizing transport
 Trivandrum city, police and civil authorities have been able to successfully manage the festival, but it is quintessentially a women's festival
 suvidhaon kii kami ke baavjood, kaaphi kathinaayee upkaran or saamagree pakaane ke parivahan main shaamil he or chamakdaar farvari suraj, pratibhaagiyon kii sankhya ko varsh varsh ke baad badhati hone lagate hai or shaamil kuch cinema se prasiddh chehron main se, saamaajik rup main bhi halkon saadhaaran

 Ravidas ji was very benevolent and kind from the beginning and it became his nature to help others
 sadhu-santon kii sahaayta karne main unako vishesh anand miltaa tha
 They used to give them shoes without paying any price
 unke swabhaav ke kaaran unke mata-pita unase aprasann rahete the
 After some time he drove Ravidas and his wife away from their home
 ravidaas ji pados main hi apane liye ek alag imaarat banaakar tatparta se apane vyavsaay kaa kaam karte the or shesh samay ishwar-bhajan tathaa sadhu-santon ke satsang main vyateet karte the
 The small events of his life reveal his qualities related to the observance of time and speech
 ek baar ek parv ke avasar par pados ke log ganga-snaan ke liye ja rahe the
 When one of the disciples of Raidas urged them to walk too, they said, i must walk for Ganga-bathing, but today i have promised to make shoes for a person
 yadi main use aaj juute nahin de sakaa to vachan bhang hoga
 When Ganga goes to bathe, if the mind remains here then how will it attain virtue? It is advisable to do whatever the mind is prepared to do with the inner conscience
 man sahi he to ise kathaute ke jal main hi gangasnan kaa punya praapt ho saktaa he
 It is said that after this kind of practice, the proverb became popular - that if the mind is healed, the Ganges is in disarray
 raidas ne oonch-neech kii bhaavana tathaa ishwar-bhakthi ke naam par kiye jane vaale vivaad ko saraheen tathaa nirarthak bataaya or sabko paraspar miljul kar prempurvak rahane kaa upadesh diya
 He himself composed melodious and devotional hymns and used to recite them passionately
 unka vishwaas tha ki ram, krishna, kareem, raghav aadi sab ek hi parameshwar ke vividh naam hai
 In the Vedas, Quran, Puranas etc
 the same God is praised
 krisn, kareem, ram, hari, raghav, jab lag ek na pekha
 Ved Qateb saw Quran, Puranan, Sahaj one
 
 He believed that devotion to God, observance of virtue, goodwill and good behavior is essential
 abhimaan tyaag kar dusron ke saath vyavhaar karne or vinamrata tathaa shishtataa ke gunon kaa vikaas karne par unhone bahut bal diya
 In one of his hymns, he has said- kah raidas teri bhagati doori he, bhaag bade so paavai
 On the public pride mete, the public is selected
 unke vichaaron kaa aashay yahi he ki ishwar kii bhakthi bade bhagya se praapt hoti he
 a person working without pride is successful in life, as the giant elephant is unable to pick up the sugar particles, while the small body papilla easily selects these particles
 isi prakaar abhimaan tathaa badppan kaa bhav tyaag kar vinamratapurvak aacharan karne vaala manushya hi ishwar kaa bhakt ho saktaa he
 Raidas's voice was filled with true feelings of devotion, desire for the larger interest of society and human love

 His hymns and sermons gave people such education that a satisfactory solution to their doubts was made and people automatically became their followers

 It is said that Meerabai was very impressed by his devotion and became his disciple

 Even today the teachings of Sant Raidas are very important for the welfare and upliftment of the society
 unhone apane aacharan tathaa vyavhaar se yah pramanit kar diya he ki manushya apane janm tathaa vyavsaay ke aadhaar par mahaan nahin hota he
 Only qualities like superiority of ideas, work inspired by the spirit of the interest of society and good behavior are helpful in making a man great
 inhen gunon ke kaaran sant raidas ko apane samay ke samaaj main atyadhik sammaan mila or isi kaaran aaj bhi log inhen shraddhapurvak samaran karte hai

 Laxity can result in stress, guilt, loss of personal productivity, crisis creation and disagreement from other individuals in the event of a person not fulfilling their responsibilities or promises

 Author David Allen discusses two major psychological causes of work and life dysfunction that are related to anxiety, not laziness
 The first category includes things that are so small that they do not need to be concerned, tasks that obstruct the flow of things and are associated with very low impact functioning, an example of which is to fix a dirty room 
 duusari shrenee main aisi baaten shaamil hai jo itani badi hai ki un par niyantran paanaa mushkil hai, aise kaary jisase ek vyakti dar saktaa he yaa jiskaa kisi vyakti ke jivan par ek bada prabhaav padane kaa anumaan ho; jiskaa ek udhaaharan yah ho saktaa he ki ek buudhe hote mata yaa pita ke vayask bacchon ko yah tay karnaa he ki unke rahan-sahan ke liye koun si vyavastha sabase acchhee hogi yaa ek chaatr jo apni padhai ke liye ek mahatvapurn pariksha de rahaa ho
 If procrastination becomes a habit, then a person may unconsciously underestimate or underestimate the importance of a task
 vyavhaarik manovigyaan kii drushti se, james maazur ne kaha he ki shithilataa aatm-niyantran ke viruddh "laalasaa" kaa ek vishesh vishay he
 Mazur states that procrastination occurs because of a temporary waiver of a punisher, as it does with a temporary waiver for a reinforcer
 jaisaa ki maazur kehete hai, shithilataa tab hoti he jab baad ke ek bade kaary or pehle ke ek chote kaary main se kisi ek ko chunanaa padataa he; kyonki us kaary ke aseem mulya ko samay dwaara chhot mil jaataa he, ek aisi vishay-vastu jo baad vaale bade kaary kaa chayan karti he
 John Perry states that procrastination is "a way of not doing a task in a more important way", a detail that can be used in any other difficult, punctual, and important task, something that he is writing in this entry

 cropotkin kaa samaaj sambandhi apana ek darshan tha
 He has some books on this subject- rus ke araajaktaavaadi lekhakon main use sabase adhik khyaati praapt he
 It is called the harbinger of anarchist communism
 usne uttar krantikalin samaaj kii jis dharna kaa pratipaadan kiya he, usase aadhunik samyawad atyadhik prabhavit he
 Under Kropotkin's theory of life and behavior, society will be ruleless
 us samaaj main saamanjasy utpann karne ke liye kisi kanoon athwa satta ke adeshon or unke paalan kii aavashyaktaa nahin hogi
 This harmony will arise from the voluntary self-determination and voluntary organized, voluntary and independent agreement of local, national and commercial trading communities for the production and satisfaction of the various and infinite needs and desires of consumers and other civilized persons
 at: cropotkin ke anusaar vyavastha evam sanghathan main anivaaryta nahin hogi, koi kanoon nahin hoga or koi shashan nahin hoga
 The aim of anarchist society is to establish a society that is state and classless
 is samaaj main vyaktigat sampatti athwa utpaadan ke vyaktigat saadhan jaise koi mulya nahin honge
 According to Kopotkin, every person will have the right to fulfill their needs
 aise samaaj main prati yogita or sangharsh kaa ant hoga or nae samaaj main nae mulyon kaa srijan hoga, samaaj main vyakti vyakti ke sambandh main parsparik sahaayta, sahyog evam sauhardra hi jivan kaa aadhaar hoga
 The basic element of Kropotkin's philosophy was that the power or inevitability of each one reduces the freedom of the individual

 He was a cynical and absolute antagonist of the state, personal property and religion

 Due to the absence of the state, there will be no organized armies, thus the war with the world will end
 rajya kii asantulit aarthik vyavastha manushya ko aparaadh kii ore pravruth karti he
 State and law is a system created for the exploitation of the weak
 rajya ke kanoon is prakaar banaae gaye hai jisase visheshadhikarasampann varg ke vyakti adhikaron kaa anuchit upyog karke apni satta banaae rakhen
 The objective of the present law is to take away as much of the production from the producer
 bahya kshetra main swarthparata evam mahatvakankshaayen yuddh, sangharsh evam vinaash ko janm detii he
 In the internal sphere, power empowered by the state, law or property crushes the best instincts among the citizens
 maanav kaa utsaah nirvaah kar use ajnapaalan kaa ek yantra sa bana detii he
 Kropotkin did not consider anarchist society to be an idealized fantasy
 uskaa vishwaas tha ki araajaktaavaadi samaaj tarkyukt, nyyochit or vyaavhaarik he
 The economic organization of anarchist society is entirely based on the communist system
 bhoomi tathaa utpaadan ke samast sadhano par samaaj kaa swaamitv hoga
 According to Kropotkin, every person will have authority over everything
 ‘prayek vyakti utpaadan kriya main apana uchit yoga degaa or prayek vyakti ko utpaadan main se uchit hissaa paane kaa adhikaar hoga’
 That is, every person in an anarchist society will work in the society according to their intrinsic motivation, tendency and ability and will be rewarded according to their need
 araajaktaavaadi samaaj main sabhi vyaktiyon ko jivan kii aavashyaktaayen paryaapt maatra main praapt hogi
 Every person will get a proper holiday, which he will use for the fulfillment of science, art and other needs of life and for his development

 Thus the form of old Hindi continued to be developed and developed till the eleventh century

 janata main sidhon or yogiyon aadi dwaara prachlit andhvishwaas fail rahe
 They were, even in the scholarly class, the orthodoxy and primordiality had taken precedence
 mayawad ke prabhaav se lokavimukhataa or niskriyata ke bhav samaaj main panpane lage the
 At such a time a huge cultural movement took place across India in the form of Bhakti movement, which established the social and personal values that were eminent in the society
 bhakthi andolan kaa aarambh dakshin ke alwar santon dwaara dasvin sadi ke lagbhag hua
 Four Vaishnava sects stood there against Shankaracharya's advaitaism and Mayaism
 in chaaron sampradaayon ne uttar bharat main vishnu ke avtaron kaa prachaarprasar kiya
 One of these was promoted by Ramanujacharya, whose disciple Ramananda preached Rambhakti in North India
 ramanand ke ram brahm ke sthanapann the jo rakshason kaa vinaash or apni lila kaa vistaar karne ke liye sansar main avateern hote hai
 In the field of Bhakti, Ramanand laid special emphasis on eradicating discrimination of high order
 ram ke sagun or nirgun do roopon ko maananevaale do bhakton - kabir or tulsi ko inhone prabhavit kiya
 At the same time Vallabhacharya started his Pushtimarg on the basis of Vishnuswami's Shuddhavaita opinion
 barahavin se solahavin sadi tak puure desh main puranasammat krishnacharitra ke aadhaar par kai sampradaay pratishthit hue, jinamein sabase zyada prabhaavshaalee vallabh kaa pushtimaarg tha
 He called the virtuous form of Brahman as real against Shankarism
 unke mat se yah sansar mithyaa yaa maaya kaa prasar nahin he balki brahm kaa hi prasar he, at: satya he
 He considered Krishna to be an incarnation of Brahma and for his attainment it was necessary that the devotee's complete surrender
 bhagavan ke anugrah yaa pushti ke dwaara hi bhakthi sulabh ho sakati he
 In this sect, the sweet form of Gopijanavallabh, Lilapurushotam Krishna was accepted for worship
 is prakaar uttar bharat main vishnu ke ram or krishna avtaron pratishtha hui
 Thus, on the basis of these different views, two branches of Bhaktikavya in Hindi called Nirgun and Saguna went together
 nirgunamat ke do upavibhag hue - gyanashrayi or premashrayi
 The representatives of the first are Kabir and the second is Jaisi
 sagunmat bhi do upadharaon main pravaahit hua - rambhakti or krishnabhakti
 The first representative is Tulsi and the second is Surdas
 gyanashrayi shakha ke pramukh kavi kabir par taatkaalik vibhinn dharmik pravritiyon or darshanik maton kaa sammilit prabhaav he
 The form of religion reformer and social reformer is special in his works
 unhone aacharan kii shuddhta par bal diya
 He was intensely betrayed by externalities, stereotypes and superstitions
 manushya kii kshamta kaa udghosh kar unhone nimnashrenee kii janata main aatmgaurav kaa bhav jagaaya

 premashrayi dhara ke sarvapramukh kavi jaaysi hai jinka "padmavat' apni maarmik premavyanjana, katharas or sahaj kalavinyas ke kaaran vishesh prashansit hua he
 Among his other compositions are "akhrawad 'and" Aakhri Kalam' etc
, which contain Sufi sects
 is dhara ke anya kavi hai qutuban, manzan, usmaan, shaikh nabi or nur mohammad aadi
 From today's point of view, the importance of this entire devotee is more due to the human feelings and emotions of the world than its righteousness
 isi vichaar se bhaktikaal ko hindi kavy kaa swarna yug kaha ja saktaa he
 a new twist in Hindi poetry took place around 1700 AD
 ise visheshat: taatkaalik darbari samskruti or sanskritsahitya se uttejnaa mili
 Certain portions of Sanskrit literature have led him to a classical discipline
 hindi main 'reeti' yaa 'kavyariti' shabd kaa prayog kavyashastra ke liye hua tha
 Therefore, keeping in view the poetic general creation process and the majority of the characteristic signs of rasa, ornamentation, etc
, the poetry of this time is called 'ritikavya'
 is kavy kii shringaari pravritiyon kii puraani parampara ke spasht sanket sanskrit, praakrit, apbhransh, farsi or hindi ke adikavy tathaa krishnakavy kii shringaari pravritiyon main milte hai
 Ritikavya's work was started by a Sanskritist
 ye the acharya keshavadas, jinaki sarvaprasiddh rachanaayen kavipriya, rasikapriya or ramchandrika hai
 Several decades after Keshava, from the Chintamani to the eighteenth century, the Ajastra source of ritualism flowed in Hindi, with a very artistic expression of the delightful aspects of male-female life and the Saras sensibilities of it
 reetikaal ke kavi raajaaon or raison ke aashray main rahete the
 There was a natural atmosphere of entertainment and artistry
 bauddhik anand kaa mukhya saadhan vahaan uktivaichitraya samajha jaataa tha
 Literature written in such an environment was mostly erotic and artistic
 par isi samay prem ke svachhand gayak bhi hue jinhone prem kii gaharaaiyon kaa sparsh kiya he
 Both in terms of quantity and poetry, this period's poetic euphemism of male-female love and beauty is important
 reetikavy mukhyat: maansal shringaar kaa kavy he
 It has a beautiful opening to the memorable aspects of male-female life
 adhik kavy muktak style main he, par prabandhkavy bhi hai
 In these two hundred years, Shringarakavya had an extraordinary rise
 par dhire dhire reeti kii jakad badhati gai or hindi kavy kaa bhavakshetra sankeern hota gaya
 By coming to the modern era, the attention of writers was particularly attracted to these two shortcomings
 inhen bhi dekhen - This is the early period of the modern era when Indians came into contact with European culture
 bharat main apni jaden jamaane ke kaam main angareji shashan ne bhartiya jivan ko vibhinn staron par prabhavit or andolit kiya
 The structure of the situational lifestyle began to break down due to the new circumstances

 New dimensions of conflict and reconciliation emerged
 naye yug ke sahityasrujan kii sarvocch sambhaavnaayen khadi boli gadhy main nihit thim, isliye ise gadhy-yug bhi kaha gaya he
 Ancient prose of Hindi is found in Rajasthani, Maithili and Brajbhasha but he was unable to become a medium of literature
 khadiboli kii parampara pracheen he
 Examples of this have been scattered in poetry ranging from Amir Khusro to Medieval Bhushan
 khadi boli gadhy ke bhi puraane namoonay mili hai
 a lot of such prose is written in Persian and Gurmukhi script
 dakshin kii musalmaan riyasaton main "dakkhini' ke naam se iskaa vikaas hua
 The prose of Ramprasad Niranjani and Daulatram written in the eighteenth century is available

 At the Fort William College in Calcutta, Lallu Lal and Sadal Mishra, by writing prose books, gave some assistance in the development of the preconceptions of Hindi prose dialect prose, for the use of new English officers
 munshi sadasukhlal or insha allaa khan kii gadhy rachanaayen isi samay likhi gai
 Later, the press, journalists, Christian evangelists and new educational institutions helped in the development of Hindi prose
 bengal, punjab, gujarat aadi vibhinn praanton ke nivaasiyon ne bhi isaki unnati or prasar main yoga diya
 The first Hindi newspaper "udant Martand" was published in 1826 from Calcutta

 Aryasamaj and other cultural movements also carried forward modern prose

 The public was upset and angered by the diplomatic tactics and economic exploitation of the British

 bhaaratendu ke samakaleen sahitya main visheshat: gadhysahitya main tatkaaleen vaicharik or bhautik parivesh kii vibhinn avasthaaon kii spasht or jivant abhivyakti hui
 The new creations of this era are full of patriotism and social reform
 anek nai paristhitiyon kii takaraahat se raajnneetik or saamaajik vyang kii pravriti bhi udbuddha hui
 The prose of this time has a liveliness of speech
 lekhakon ke vyaktitv se samprukt hone ke kaaran usamen paryaapt rochakata aa gai he
 Most of the essays were written which were also subjective and thoughtful and descriptive
 anek shaileyon main kathasahitya bhi likhaa gaya, adhiktar shikshapradhan
 But the realist vision and uniqueness of the new craft lies in Srinivasa Das's "examination"
 [[devkinandan khatri kaa tilsmi upanyaas 'chandrakanta' isi samay prakashit hua
 a substantial amount of plays and social acts were composed
 bhaaratendu, pratapanarayan mishra, shrinivas das, aadi pramukh naatakkaar hai
 Also many succulent poems of devotion and adornment were also produced
 par jin kavitaaon main saamaajik bhaavon kii abhivyakti hui ve hi naye yug kii srujanshiltaa kaa aarambhik abhas detii hai
 The remaining poems were written in Brajbhasha except for sporadic experiments of Khadi dialect
 vastav main nayaa yug is samay ke gadhy main hi adhik pratifalit ho sakaa
 The most important events of this period are two - one is the acceptance of the standing dialect as a general poetry, and the other is the regulation and refinement of Hindi prose
 is kaary main sarvaadhik shashakt yoga saraswati sampadak mahaviraprasad dvivedi kaa tha
 Dwivedi and his colleagues developed expressiveness of Hindi prose
 niabandh ke kshetra main dvivedi ji ke atirikt balmukund, chandradhar sharma guleri, purnasingh, padmasingh sharma jaise ek se ek saavdhaan, shashakt or jeevant gadhyshaileekar saamne aae
 Many novels were written but his realist tradition could not develop significantly
 yatharthparak aadhunik kahaniyaan isi kaal main janami or vikasman hui
 Apart from Guleri, Kaushik etc
, early stories of Premchand and Prasad also came to light at this time
 naatak kaa kshetra avashya suunaa sa rahaa
 The most influential critic of this time was Dwivedi, whose revisionist and myriad critical criticism influenced many contemporary literature
 mishrabandhu, krishnabihari mishra or padmasingh sharma is samay ke anya sameekshak hai par kul milakar is samay kii samiksha bahyapakshapradhan hi rahi
 Inspired by the reformist ideals, Ayodhyasinh Upadhyaya in his "priyapravasa" introduced Radha's public service and also demonstrated mastery in the use of various forms of Khadiboli
 maithilisharan gupt ne "bharat bharti' main rashtriyata or samajasudhar kaa swar unchaa kiya or "saket' main urmila kii pratishtha kii
 Other poets of this time are Dwivedi ji, Sridhar Pathak, Balamukund Gupta, Nathuram Sharma 'shankar', Gaya Prasad Shukla 'sanehi' etc
 brajabhasha kavyaparampara ke pratinidhi ratnakar or satyanarayan kaviratn hai
 At this time the work of standing dialect was done in accordance with the refinement of poetry and contemporary environment
 nae kavy kaa adhikansh vichaarparak or varnanaatmak he
 In the two decades of 1920–40, many forms of ideological and artistic trends flourished under modern literature
 sarvaadhik lokapriyata upanyaas or kahani ko mili
 In the Kathashakhyatya, living memories were created while living in place of eventuality
 nimna or madhyavargeey samaaj ke yatharthparak chitra vyapak rup main prastut kiye gaye
 Lively styles of narration evolved
 is samay ke sarvapramukh kathakaar premchand hai
 Vrindavanlal Varma's historical novel is also mentioned
 hindi naatak is samay jaishankar prasad ke saath srijan ke naveen str par arohan karata he
 His romantic historical drama became of special importance due to its vibrant characterization, planning and sensitivities to dramatic conflicts
 kai anya naatakkaar bhi sakriy dikhaai pade
 In the field of Hindi criticism, Ramchandra Shukla poignantly inaugurated the subtle conditions and artistic features of Sur, Tulsi and Jayasi and emphasized the social values of literature
 anya aalochak he shri nandadulaare vaajapeyi, da
 nagendra tathaa da

 This is the era of the development of cinematography in the field of poetry

 The beauty of nature attracted him special
 vaiyaktik sanvegon kii pramukhataa ke kaaran chhayavaadi kavy mulat: pragitatmak he
 At this time, the expressiveness of the Khadi dialect was uniquely developed
 jaishankar prasad, maakhanlaal, sumitranandan pant, sooryakanth treepathi "niraala', mahadevi, naveen or dinakar chhayavaad ke utkrisht kavi hai
 After 1940, there was a union movement of progressivism, which is socialized, realistic and utilitarian in opposition to the sentimental, aesthetic and imaginative individualism tendencies of Shadowism
 saamaajik vaishamy or vargsangharsh kaa bhav isamen vishesh mukhar hua
 It embraced literature as an instrument of social revolution
 apni upyogetavaadi drushti kii simaaon ke kaaran pragativaadee sahitya, visheshat: kavita main kalatmak utkarsh kii sambhaavnaayen adhik nahin thim, phir bhi usne sahitya ke saamaajik paksh par bal dekar ek nai chetana jaagrath kii
 Shortly after the start of the Progressive Movement, another individualist trend influenced by the new psychology or psychoanalysis was active in the field of literature, which was called experimentalism after 1943
 isi kaa sanshodhit rup vartmaankaleen nai kavita or nai kahaniyaan hai
 In this way, we see that in the Second World War and its later literature, dissatisfaction and disenchantment towards the misery of life, ugliness and anomalies gave rise to two types of tendencies
 ek kaa naam pragativaad he, jo marks ke bhautikwaadi jeevandarshan se prerana lekar chalaa; doosraa prayogwaad he, jisane paramparaagat aadarshon or sansthaaon ke prati apane ansatosh kii teevr pratikriyaaon ko sahitya ke naveen rupagat prayogon ke madhyam se vyakt kiya
 The new psychology had a profound effect on this
 pragativaad se prabhavit kathakaron main yashpal, upendranath ashk, amritlal nagar or nagarjun aadi vishisht hai
 Among the critics are Ram Vilas Sharma, Namwar Singh, Vijaydev Narayan Sahi
 kaviyon main kedarnath agarwal, nagarjun, rangey raghav, shivamangala singh 'suman' aadi ke naam prasiddh hai
 Achabharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi, Vidya Niwas Mishra and Kuberanath Rai earned special fame in this period in the essay mode
 nae manovigyaan se prabhavit prayogon ke liye sachesht kathakaron main agyeya pramukh hai
 Critically affected by psychology are Elachandra Joshi and Jainendra
 in lekhakon ne vyaktiman ke avchetan kaa udghaatan kar nayaa naitik bodh jagaane kaa praytn kiya
 Janendra and Agnayya broke the traditional structure of fiction and made new stylistic experiments
 parvarti lekhakon or kaviyon main vaiyaktik pratikriyaayein adhik prakhar huin
 They are fully integrated with the contemporary environment
 unhone samaaj or sahitya kii manyataon par gaharaa prashnchihn laga diya he
 Apart from expressing helplessness, frustration, resentment etc
 of individual life, they are engaged in exploring new life values on a personal level

 Our contemporary literature suffers from extreme individualism and this is its limit
 par uskaa sabase bada bal uski jeevanmayata he jisamen bhavishya kii shashakt sambhaavnaayen nihit hai
 This information is very correct
