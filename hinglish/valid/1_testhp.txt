 He severely criticized all religious movements, ancient and contemporary, and also ridiculed the gods and their miracles in compositions like the Dialogues of the Gods and the Syriac Goddess

 The language that is popularly known as "demotic Greek" as opposed to classical
 inamen adhikansh loakgeet kii shrenee main aate hai or lokajeevan ke utaar chadhaav ke pratibimb hai
 The main inspiration of these songs is cosmic and their recollection recounts the mythology prevalent in the golden age of Queen Elizabeth I, in which youthful exuberance, nature love and exquisite lips in Sura Sundari as well as melodious agony, which is the transience of physical pleasure beauty Originates from is panrapara main kuch aise kavy bhi hai jinka mahatv aitihaasik he or udgam-strot tatkaaleen durghatnaayen; udhaaharan ke liye ham un lokgeeton ko le sakate hai jo kustutuniya ke patan par shok tathaa uske rakshakon ke saahas tathaa shaury par santosh prakat karte hai

 Although the Mughal army was not disqualified, it was not blameless, firstly it was not a national army, but a combination of different elements, with each element trying to follow its bizarre methods and warfare, thus passing the time

 By giving false news to the government, staunch followers of Islam got Guru Arjun Dev ji sentenced to death
 jab guru arjuna dev, ko bahut dukh de kar shahid kar diya gaya to guru hargobind ji ne talwaar uthaa lee
 This sword was raised only for self-defense and for the betterment of the general public
 guru hargobind ji ke jivan main un par lagaataar 4 hamale hue or satguru hari raae par bhi ek hamalaa hua
 Guru Hari Krishna also tried to make emperor Aurangzeb his follower
 guru teg bahadur ko sarkaar ne maut ke ghat utaar diya, kyonki wo hindu brahminon ke dukhon ko dekh kar sarkaar se apil karne gaye the
 After that, the government clergy started considering the increasing propaganda of Gurmat and the huge number of followers as a threat to their religion and they united against it
 is bich guru gobind singh ne kuch baniyon kii rachana kii jis main islam ke khilaaf sakht tippaniyan thi
 In view of the above circumstances and the oppressive behavior of Aurangzeb and his nominees towards the non-muslim people, when Guru Gobind Singh decided to wage an armed struggle to protect the religion, he looked for the Sikhs who pursue the Gurmat ideology, help the miseries
 Do and do not back down in the sacrifice of your sacrifice when you need it
 jab koi dharm aage badhata he to uske bahut aam dikhta he ki uske anuyaayi bahut hai, zyaadaatar to dekha-dekhi ho jate hai, kuch shardha main ho jate hai, kuch apane khudgarji ke kaaran ho jate hai, asal anuyaayi to hote hi gine chune hai
 Evidence of this was found in Anandpur
 jab satgur gobind singh ne talwaar nikal kar kaha kii ""unhen ek sir chaiye"" | sab hakke bakke rah gaye | kuch to maukey se hi khisak gaye | kuch kehane lag pade guru pagal ho gaya he | kuch tamaasha dekhne aae the | kuch mata gujri ke paas bhaag gaye kii dekho tumharaa saputra kya khichdi pakaa rahaa he | Bhai Daya Singh ji was the first hand in the crowd of 10 thousand
 Behind the Gurmat ideology, he had the ability to behead
 Guru Sahib took him to the tent
 There was a goat neck cut
 Blood appeared to come out of the tent
 Fear increased in public
 Even then, by showing snow, Dharam Singh, Himmat Singh, Mohkam Singh, Sahib Singh accepted to cut their sis
 Guru Sahib kept goatting
 paanchon ko phir tamboo se bahar niklaa or khande bate kii pahul tayar kii | Khanda Bata is composed of Jantra mantras and tantras smelled
 isko pehali baar satgur gobind singh ne banaaya tha
 The water prepared by this method is called "pahul"
 aam bhashaa main ise log amrit bhi kehete hai
 By drinking this, the Sikh becomes a part of the Khalsa Army, that is, he has now surrendered his body and wealth to God, now he will only proclaim the truth and if the need arises, he will not back down from cutting his throat
 sab vikaron se dur rahegaa
 Such a Sikh is also called Amritdhari
 yah pahul paanchon ko pilaai gai or unhen paanch pyaaron ke kitaab se niwaja
 2 Kakkar was already in Sikhism
 jahaan sikh atmik satl par sab se bheen samaj rakhata tha satgur gobind singh ji ne un do kakaron ke saath saath kangha, kadaa or kacha de kar shaareerik dekh main bhi khalse ko bhinn kar diya
 Today, Khande Bate's Pahul prepares only five beloved
 yah prikriya aaj rivaaj ban gayi he
 Today the test is not taken as it was
 is prikriya ko amrit sanchaar bhi kaha jaataa he
 History is a witness to the fact that Guru Gobind Singh ji also used to run under five love and obeyed his orders
 paanch pyaaron ne gobind singh ko chamkor kaa kila chhodane kaa hukum diya or unhen maananaa padaa
 The five loves then interrupted Gobind Singh ji, while Gobind Singh was greeting Dadu's tomb to examine these
 gobind singh ne banda bahadur ko bhi paanch pyaaron ke sang bheja gaya, itihaas main zikr he ki jab banda bahadur pyaaron kii ulanghnaa karata rahaa to banda bahadur ko sab kile main chhod gaye
 Gobind Singh and the Khalsa army helped Bahadur Shah and also took iron from his brother to make him the ruler
 khalsa ne hi guru gobind singh kii baniyon ko khoja or granth ke rup main dhaala

 Hyperthyroidism, or hyperthyroidism, is a term used for hyperactive tissues within the thyroid that leads to an overproduction of the thyroid hormone
 is tarah, atigalagranthita, thyrotoxicosis, arthath rakt main bade hue galagranthi hormone kii naidanik sthiti, kaa ek kaaran he
 It is worth noting that hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis are not synonymous
 udhaaharan ke liye, thyrotoxicosis bajaay iske bahirzaat thyroid hormone ke antargrahan yaa thyroid granthi kii sujan ke kaaran ho saktaa he, jisaki vajah se yah apane thyroid hormone ke bhandar se sravit hone lagata he
 thyroid hormone koshikeey str par mahatvapurn he, jo sharir ke lagbhag har prakaar ke utak ko prabhavit karata he
 When the thyroid gland starts producing hormones in large quantities, the body starts using energy more than the quantity
 ise hyper thyrodism yaa avatu garnthi kii atisakriyata kehete hai
 This disease can happen to people of any age, however the ratio of female to male is five to eight times more than that of male
 avatugranthi ek choti si granthi hoti he jo titali ke aakaar kii nichle gardan ke bich main hoti he
 Its basic function is to control the metabolism of the body
 upaapachay ko niyantrit karne ke liye avatugranthi hormone banaata he jo sharir ke koshikaon ko yah bataata he ki kitni urja kaa upyog kiya janaa he
 If the thyroid gland works properly then the right amount of hormones required for the metabolism of the body will remain at a satisfactory rate
 jaise-jaise hormone kaa upyog hota rahata he, avatugranthi uski pratisthapana karata rahata he
 The thyroid gland controls the amount of hormones in the bloodstream by operating the pituitary gland
 jab mastishk ke neeche khopadi ke bich main sthit pituitary granthi ko yah pataa chalata he ki avatugranthi hormone kii kami hui he yaa uski maatra adhik he to vah apane hormone ko samyojit karata he or avatugranthi ko bataata he ki kya karnaa he
 The thyroid hormone acts as a controller of the speed of all processes in the body
 is gati ko chayapachay kaha jaataa he
 If there is too much thyroid hormone, then every action of the body starts accelerating
 isliye aashcharya kii baat nahin he ki atigalagranthita ke kuch lakshanon main shaamil ghabrahat, chidchidapan, pasinaa main vruddhi, dil kaa joro se dhadkna, haath kaa kaanpana, chintaa, sone main takalif hona, twachaa kaa patala hona, najuk bal, khaskar upree bahon or jaanghon kii mansapeshiyon main kamajori aana, shaamil hai
 Intestinal disturbances can be very frequent, but diarrhea or diarrhea is uncommon
 kaaphi bhukh ke baavjood kabhi-kabhi bahut adhik vajan main kami aa sakati he, ulti ho sakati he or, mahilaon main, masik srav halkaa ho saktaa he or masik srav aksar kam ho sakate hai
 Thyroid hormone is important for normal function of cells
 iske alaava, yah chayapachay ko atiuttejit or samvedi tantrika pranali ke prabhaav ko teevr karata he, isse vibhinn shaareerik pranali "tej" ho jaati he or epinephrine ke overdoj ke lakshan dikhne lagate hai
 These include heart palpitations and palpitations, symptoms of hand tremors such as nervous system tremor and anxiety, hyperactivity of the digestive system, excess weight loss and abnormal reduction in fat levels by blood tests
 atigalagranthita aamtaur par dhire-dhire shuru hoti he
 At first, it can be mistaken to understand the symptoms by considering simple nervousness due to stress
 agar koi vyakti dieting ke jariye vajan ghataane kii koshish kar rahaa he, to koi vyakti atigalagranthita se vajan ghatane se prasann ho saktaa he, jisame badi teji se vajan main kami aati he, jisase anya samasyaayein paidaa hoti hai
 In Graves' disease, which is the most common form or cause of hyperthyroidism, the upper eyelid can become enlarged, making the eyes look larger
 kabhi-kabhi, ek yaa donon ankhen baahar ubhar aati hai
 Some patients have swelling of the front neck due to enlargement of the thyroid gland
 atigalagranthita ke kaaran, vishesh rup se grevs' rog, parivaar main ho saktaa he; parivaar ke sadsy kii jaanch se anya sadasyon main bhi thyroid kii samasyaayein saamne aa sakati hai
 On the other hand, a decrease in the functioning thyroid tissue results in a symptomatic decrease in thyroid hormone, known as hypothyroidism
 atigalagranthita aksar hi antat avatu-alpakriyata main badal jaati he
 Major clinical symptoms include weight loss, anxiety, heat intolerance, hair loss, muscle aches, weakness, fatigue, hyperactivity, irritability, hypersensitivity, apathy, polyuria, hyperlipidia, delirium, tremor, pretibial mixida, and sweating
 iske alaava, rogiyon main or bhi vibhinn prakaar ke lakshan dikh sakate hai, jaise ki dhakdhaki or atalata, shwaas ksht, kamechha main kami, michali, ulti or dast
 dirghakaalik anupachaarit atigalagranthita se asthi-sushirta ho sakati he
 These classical symptoms may often not be present in the elderly
 snaivik pratyakshikaran main kampan, nartanrog, peshivikruti or kuch atisamvedansheel vyaktiyon main aavadhik pakshaaghaat ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 a relationship has been found between thyroid disease and spontaneous muscular weakness
 is haalat main, thyroid rog swabhaav se swarogksham hota he or lagbhag 5% sahaj peshi durbalata ke rogiyon main atigalagranthita bhi paayi jaati he
 Very rarely cases of spontaneous muscular weakness improve after treatment with thyroid and the relationship between the two has not been properly understood
 kuch bahut hi durlabh snaivik pratyakshikaran jo ki sandigdh rup se thyrotoxicosis ke saath jude hai ve hai sudotumor ceribri yaa pramastishk, peshishoshi parshv kaathinya or gulian-bare-jaisaa syndrome
 The short-sighted symptoms that may be present in any type of hyperthyroidism are eyelid withdrawal, weakness of the extra ocular muscles and retardation of the papilla
 In the hyperthyroid gaze, the eyelids are more upward than normal, a normal condition, where the "white" of the eye begins at the upper border of the pupil of the eye)
 Extra-vision weaknesses may be present with double vision
 mand-palak main, jab rogi apni aankh se neeche kii ore kisi vastu kaa peechha karata he, tab neeche kii ore gumti yaa jhukati putliyon kaa anusaran karne main palken vifal rahati hai or upree ore ke pradarshan main bhi usee prakaar ke hona ko palak pratigaman kaa hona kehete hai, asthaayee rup se
 atigalagranthita ke upachaar ke saath ye lakshan yaa sanket gaayab ho jate hai
 Any of these symptoms or signs of vision should not be confused with exophthalmos, which is particularly and uniquely caused by Graves' disease in hyperthyroidism
 Frontal bulge or exfoliation of the eyes is due to immune mediated inflammation in the pre-articular fat
 exonthalmos jab maujuud ho, tab atigalagranthi mand-palak or takataki ko teevr kar saktaa he
 Thyrotoxic distress is rare but is a serious problem of hyperthyroidism, which can be caused by a thyrotoxic patient becoming very ill or physically exhausted
 iske lakshan main shaamil hai: sharir ke taapmaana main 40 degree celsius se adhik kii vruddhi, drutanaadi, atalata, ulti, dast, nirjaleekaran, coma or mrityu
thyroid tufaan kaa apatkaaleen upachaar or aspataal main bhartee hona jaruri he
 Reducing the levels of circulating thyroid hormones and decreasing their production is the main treatment
 propilathiourossil or methimazol aise do agent hai jo thyroid hormone sanshleshan main kami laate hai or aamtaur par inaki ucch khuraaq di jaati he
 Sodium iodide, potassium iodide, and / or lugol solution may be given to inhibit the secretion of thyroid hormone from the thyroid gland
 propranolol jaise beta blowers hriday kii dar ko niyantrit karne main madad kar sakate hai or rakt sanchaar main sahaayta karne ke liye antahshira steroid kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 At the beginning of this century, thyroid storm mortality had reached 100%
 haalanki, ab, upar varnit chikitsa ke aakraamak upyog se, thyroid tufaan se mrityu dar 20% se kam ho gayi he
 Hyperthyroidism has the following symptoms: yadi avatugranthi kii beemaari jaldi pakad main aa jaati he to lakshan dikhaai dene se pehle upachaar se yah thik ho saktaa he
 The thyroid gland lasts a lifetime
 dhyanpurvak iske prabandhan se avatugranthi se peedit vyakti apana jivan swasth or saamaanya rup se ji sakate hai
 There are many reasons for hyperthyroidism
 adhikanshtah, sampoorn granthi thyroid hormone kaa ati-utpaadan karne lagati he
 This is called Graves' disease
 aam taur par kam maamalon main, atirikt hormone srav ke liye ek akeli granthika jimmedaar hoti he, jise "garm" granthika kaha jaataa he
 Thyroiditis can also cause hyperthyroidism
 anek naidanik sthitiyon main kaaryshil thyroid utak dwaara atirikt thyroid hormone kaa utpaadan kiya jane lagata he
 Following are the main reasons for this in humans: anek anya kaarnon se thyroid hormone kaa ucch rakt str ho saktaa he: Measuring levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone () produced by the mucous gland in the blood) is a preliminary test of particularly suspected hyperthyroidism
 ti kaa nimna str par vishisht rup se ingit karata he ki shlashmik granthi ko mastishk dwaara thyroid granthi ke uttejan main katautee karne ke liye rukaawat daali gayi he yaa "nirdeshit" kiya gaya he, jisase rakt main T4 or / yaa T3 ke staron main vruddhi hone lagati he
 Rarely, an inferior TSH indicates primary failure of the mucosa, or temporary blockage of the mucosa due to other disease, and therefore examination of T4 and T3 is still clinically useful
 grevs rog main prati-ti-abhigraahak rog-pratikaarak yaa hashimoto ke thyroditis main prati-thyroid-paroxides jaise vishisht rog-pratikaarakon ko maapne se bhi rog nidaan main yogadan ho saktaa he
 Blood tests confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, indicating a decrease in thyroid stimulation hormone levels and an increase in T4 and T3 levels
 ti mastishk main shlashmik granthi dwaara banaaya gaya ek hormone he, jo thyroid granthi ko bataata he ki kitna hormone bananaa he
 When thyroid hormone is very high, then TSH decreases
 radiodharmee iodine udgrahan pareekshan or thyroid scan donon atigalagranthita ke kaaran kaa charitra-chithran karte hai yaa radiologist or doctoron ko atigalagranthita ke kaaran ke nirdhaaran main sakasham banaate hai
 Empty stomach radioactive iodine injection is used during the levitation test to measure the amount of iodine absorbed by the thyroid gland or injected into the body by mouth
 atigalagranthita se grast vyakti bahut zyada iodine aatmsaat kar lete hai
 Specifically operated thyroid scan images in connection with the levitation test, allowing visual examination of the gland's hyperactivity
 atigalagranthita or thyroditis se aayi is beemaari ke charitra chithran ke liye thyroid cintigraphy ek upyogi pareekshan he
 This test system typically involves two interconnected tests: a iodine levitation test and a scan with a gamma camera
 The levitation test involves taking a single dose of radioactive iodine, specifically iodine-123 or 123I, as the most suitable isotopic of iodine for clinical studies of thyroid disease
 thyroid utak or thyroid cancer aparoopaantaran kii chhaviyaan banane ke liye I-123 lagbhag iodine kaa adarsh samasthanik he
 Typically, a tablet containing sodium iodide is swallowed by mouth, containing small amounts of iodine-123, possibly less than a grain of salt
 aam taur par goli nigalane se pehle do ghante or uske baad ek ghante tak upwas main rahanaa aavashyak he
 They are generally tolerated by these low doses of radioiodine that are otherwise allergic to iodine and cannot tolerate adverse medium containing large doses of iodine used in similar image-forming diagnostic systems)
 The body excretes excess radioiodine that cannot be absorbed into the thyroid gland by the urine
 kuch rogi naidanik radioiodine se halki allergic pratikraya kaa anubhav kar sakate hai or unhen histaminarodhi diya ja saktaa he
 The patient usually regains the level of radioiodine "leaking" 24 hours later, measured by a device connected to a metal spindle tied to the throat, measuring radioactivity emission from the thyroid
 is pareekshan main 4 minute lagate hai, tab tak mashin software ke dwaara udgrahan % sanchit hota he
 Typically, a scan is also performed, where images of the anomalous thyroid gland are taken from the gamma camera; The radiologist studies it and after examining the images produces a report mentioning the levitation% and giving his comment
 atigalagranthi ke rogi vishishtatya saamaanya se unche str kaa radioiodine "grahan karte" hai
 The typical range of RAI levitation is from 10–30%
 ti staron ke pareekshan ke alaava, anek doctor adhik vistrut parinaamon ke liye T3, free T3, T4 or / yaa free T4 ke bhi pareekshan karte hai
 Typical adult limits for these hormones are: TSH: 0
45 - 4
50 uiu / ml, T4 free / direct: 0
82 - 1
77 ng / dl; And T3: 71 - 180 ng / dl
 Individuals with hyperthyroidism can easily display these upper limits of T4 and / or T3 several times
 thyroid granthi aalekh main thyroid kaary kii saamaanya shrenee simaaon kii sampurna talika dekhen
 The following are the causes of hyperthyroidism maanav main atigalagranthita ke upachaar ke liye brihad or aam taur par sweekaarya roopaatmakataaon main damanaatmak thyrostetics upachaar kaa praarambhik asthaayee upyog shaamil he or sambhawatah baad main sthaayee shalya chikitsa yaa radio samasthanik chikitsa kaa upyog bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 All the pathways under active thyroid function can be the cause, which can be easily handled with levothyroxine supplementation
 thyrostetics dawaaen thyroid hormone ke utpaadan ko atakati hai, jaise ki karbimajol or methimajol or propylathuresil
 mana jaataa he ki thyrostetics thyroparoxides dwaara thyroglobulin ke iodinikaran ko rokane kaa kaam karata he or is tarah tetra-yodothyronin ke nirmaan ko roktaa he
 Propylthurasil also functions outside the thyroid gland, actively inhibiting the conversion of T3 into T3
 chunki thyroid utak aamtaur par thyroid hormone kaa ek bada sanchay rakhe hote hai, isliye thyrostetics ko prabhavi ho paane main kai saptaah lag jate hai or khuraaq ko praayah maheenon kii avadhi main titrate karne kii jarurat padati he, saath hi niyamit rup se doctoron kii dekhbhaal or parinaamon kii jaanch ke liye rakt pareekshan bhi karte rahanaa padataa he
 Initial treatment often requires a very high dose, but patients may develop symptoms of hyperactivity if a high dose is used continuously
 khuraaq kaa yah anumapank sahi dhang se kar paanaa mushkil he or isiilie kabhi-kabhi "baadha va pratisthaapan" kaa dhang apanaaya jaataa he
 In obstruction and replacement therapy, sufficient amounts of thyrostatics are taken to completely stop thyroid hormones, treating the patient as if he has complete hypothyroidism
 dhakdhaki, kampan or vyagrata jaise atigalagranthita ke aam lakshanon main se anek koshika satahon par beta adrinergik abhigrahakon main vruddhi dwaara bich-bachaav kiye jate hai
 Beta blockers, typically used in the treatment of high blood pressure, are drugs that counterbalance this effect, reduce palpitations associated with palpitations, and decrease tremor and anxiety
 is prakaar, atigalagranthita se peedit marij aksar tatkaal asthaayee raahat praapt kar sakate hai, jab tak ki upar bataaye radioiodine pareekshan se atigalagranthita kaa charitra chithran ho jaataa he or phir tab adhik sthaayee ilaaj shuru ho sakati he
 Note that these drugs do not treat its long-term effects due to hyperthyroidism or non-treatment, but only treat or alleviate the symptoms of the condition
 thyroid hormone ke utpaadan par kuch alpatam prabhaav tathaapi propranolol se bhi aata he -jiskaa atigalagranthita ke upachaar main do bhoomikaayen hoti hai, jo propranolol ke alag samavayavi padaarth dwaara nirdhaarit hota he
 L-propranolol is the cause of beta-inhibition, so it treats symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism such as tremor, palpitations, rash, and heat intolerance
 di-propranolol thyroxin deodinage kaa avrodh karata he, is tarah T3 main T4 ke roopantaran ko avaruddh karke kuch, haalanki alpatam prabhaav pradaan karata he
 Other beta blockers are used only to treat symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism
 america main propranolol or britain main metoprolol kaa istemaal aksar atigalagranthi ke marijon ke ilaaj main vruddhi karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Premature surgery is an option for reduced use of invasive radio isotopic therapy, but is still needed in cases where the thyroid gland is enlarged and causes pressure on the neck, or the underlying cause of hyperthyroidism
 Essentially cancer-related
 surgery kaa prayog vyapak rup se nahin kiya jaataa he, kyonki atigalagranthita ke sabase aam roopon kaa bahut prabhavakaari ilaaj radiodharmee iodine paddati dwaara kiya jaataa he or chunki parathyroid grathiyon ko nikaalane or aavartak laringial tantrika ke kaate jane se niglana mushkil ho jaataa he or kisi badi surgery se yahaan tak ki samanyikrut stavakgolanu sankraman ho saktaa he
 Some Graves' disease patients, however, can tolerate medications for this or that reason, patients who are allergic to iodine, or patients who refuse radioiodine may opt for surgery
 iske alaava, kuch sarjanon kaa maananaa he ki asaamaanya rup se badi granthi vaale, yaa jinaki ankhen kotor se baahar nikali hui hon, aise marijon ke liye radioiodine upachaar asurakshit he; bhay he ki radioiodine 131 kii bahut adhik khuraaq se marij ke lakshan bad ja sakate hai
 In iodine-131 radio isotopic therapy, radioactive iodine-131 is given through the mouth for one time to prevent or completely destroy the function of the hyperactive thyroid gland
 The isotopic use of this radioactive iodine for ablation treatment is more potent than clinical radioiodine, which has a biological half-life of 8–13 hours
 iodine-131, jo bhi beta kanon ko samaapt karata he jo simit kshetra main utakon ke liye kahin adhik nuksaankaree he, kaa lagbhag 8 dinon kaa arddh-jivan hota he
 Patients who are not affected by the first dose are sometimes given additional, larger doses of radio iodine
 is ilaaj main iodine-131 ko thyroid main sakriy koshikaon dwaara uthaa liya jaataa he or unhen nasht kar detaa he, thyroid granthi ko zyaadaatar yaa puri tarah se niskriy bana detaa he
 Since iodine is easily ingested by thyroid cells and even more readily by overactive thyroid cells, sleep destruction occurs locally and does not have widespread side effects of this therapy
 50 varshon se radioiodine anshochhedan kaa prayog ho rahaa he or iskaa upyog nahin karne kii ekmaatr badi vajah hai garbhavastha or stanpan 
 ek baar jab thyroid granthi niskriy bana di jaati he, tab sharir kii thyroid hormone kii maatra kii zarurat ko puraa karne ke liye pratidin munh ke jariye pratisthaapan hormone chikitsa aasaani se di ja sakati he
 However, a skewed study notes that the incidence of cancer was seen after radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism
 atigalagranthita ke liye radioiodine upachaar kaa pramukh laabh yah he ki aushadhi chikitsa kii tulana main isamen safalataa dar bahut adhik he
 Depending on the dose of radioiodine selected and the disease being treated, the success rate of the definitive solution for hyperthyroidism may vary from 75–100%
 grevs rogiyon main radioiodine kaa ek pramukh sambhavit dushprabhav ke rup main jivan bhar ke liye avatu-alpakriyata kaa vikaas he, jiske liye pratidin thyroid hormone ke ilaaj kii zarurat he
 Occasionally, some patients may require more than one radioactive treatment, depending on the type of disease, the size of the thyroid and the initial administered dose given
 anek rogi pehle is baat se dukhi hote hai ki unhen jivan bhar thyroid hormone kii goli leni padegi
 phir bhi, thyroid hormone surakshit, saste or aasaani se nigal lene vaale hote hai; or hormone thyroid ke jaise hote hai tathaa saamanytah thyroid dwaara hi bane hote hai; aam taur par yah chikitsa bahut adhikansh rogiyon ke liye atyant surakshit or bahut hi sahneeya he
 The destruction of thyroid tissue as a result of radioactive iodine treatment, often leads to a moving period of several days to weeks when symptoms of hyperthyroidism may actually worsen after radioactive iodine treatment
 thyroid hormone yukt thyroid koshikaon ke radiodharmee iodine-janit vinaash ke baad rakt main thyroid hormone ke jari hone se aamtaur par aisa hota he
 In some patients, drug treatments such as beta blockers may be useful in this period
 anek rogi shuruuaati kuch saptaah ko bina kisi samasya ke bardaasht karne main samarth hote hai
 Most patients did not experience any difficulty after radioactive iodine treatment, usually given as a small pill
 agar thyroid main halki sujan viksit ho or gardan yaa kanth kshetra main pareshaani paidaa kar rahi ho to kabhi-kabhi, kuch dinon baad gardan sukumaartha yaa gale kaa shoth prakat ho ja saktaa he
 It is usually temporary and is not associated with fever etc
 radiodharmee iodine upachaar ke baad jo mahilaayein stanpan karaati hai unhen kam se kam ek saptaah or sambhawatah adhik samay tak ke liye stanpan karana band kar dena chahie, kyonki radiodharmee iodine upachaar ke kai saptaah baad bhi radiodharmee iodine kii kuch maatra stan ke doodh main paayi ja sakati he
 a common result after radioiodine is hyperthyroidism, a change from thyroid dysfunction to easily treatable thyroiditis and 78% of those treating Graves' thyrotoxicosis, and 40% of those treated with polycystic gland, or toxic gland tumors alone
 it happens
 radioiodine kii badi khuraaq kaa prayog upachaar vifaltaa kii ghatnaon ko kam kar detaa he, ilaaj ke ucch pratisaad ke liye harjane ke rup main falswaroop avatu-alpakriyata kii oonchi dar adhikanshtah shaamil he, jiskaa hormone ilaaj jivan bhar karnaa padataa he
 Ultrasound scans showed increased sensitivity to the thyroid more uniformly than radioiodine therapy, which is due to the large cells that are converted to 81% hypothyroid, which is 37% higher than the normal scan appearance
 Huh
 atigalagranthita ke charam lakshanon ke saath thyroid storm upasthit hota he
 It is treated with aggression, with resuscitation measures including the above combinations, including: a thionamide such as methimazole, followed by venous beta blockers such as propranolol, an iodinated radiocontrast agent or iodine solution if a radiocontrast agent is not available
 Venous steroid hydrocortizone
 pashu chikitsa main, atigalagranthita puraani paaltu billiyon ko prabhavit karne vaali sabase aam antamasravi sthitiyon main ek he
 According to some veterinarians, up to 2% of cats over the age of 10 have it
 1970 ke dashak main billiyon kii atigalagranthita par pehali report aane ke baad se yah rog ullekhneey rup se adhik aam ban gaya
 In cats, benign tumors seem to be a cause of hyperthyroidism, but research is ongoing to find out the cause of such tumors developing in those cats
 haalanki, america rasinic socity ke ek prakaashan, paryaavaran vigyaan va takanic main prakashit haal ke shodh aalekh main kaha gaya he ki polibrominated dyphinil ithrs ) naamak paryaavarniya sandupakon ke anaavaran se billiyon kii atigalagranthita ke anek maamle jude hue hai; ye sandooshak anek gharelu utpaadon ke agni mandakon main maujuud hote hai, khaskar furniture or kuch electronic saamaan main
 The report is based on a study conducted jointly by researchers from the epa's National Health and Environmental Effects Laboratory and the University of Indiana

 haal hi main, thyroid uttejan hormone abhigraahak ke utparivartanon kii khoj kii gai he, jo thyroid granthi koshikaon ke daihik sakriyan kaa ek kaaran hai
 Several other factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease, such as mumps and iodine and selenium elements in the diet
 sabase aam prakat hone vaale lakshan hai: teji se vajan ghatana, teevr hriday spandan dar, ulti, dast, atipipasa or bhojan main vruddhi, tathaa mutr utpaadan main vruddhi

 There are the same three treatment options used for humans in cats' hyperthyroidism
 Cats must be given medication for the rest of their lives, but less expensive options may be given to especially older cats
 radioiodine upachaar or surgery aksar atigalagranthita ko thik kar detii hai

 galileo gallily italy ke vaigyanik the
 He was a great inventor and had incomparable support in the development of visionaries
 is mahaan vichaarak kaa janm aadhunik italy ke pisa naamak shahar main ek sangitajna parivaar main hua tha
 The city of Pisa, modern Italy, had historically blamed the birth of the great scientist Galileo Galilei on 15 February 1564 as a flaw in the creation of God
 galileo ke dwaara pratipaadit sindvanto se dharmik manyataon kaa khandan hota tha jiske liye galileo ko ishwariya manyataon se chhedchhad karne ke liye sari umr karawas kii sajaa sunaayi gayi
 His father Vincenzo Galilei was a well-known music expert of the time
 ve "lut" naamak vaadya yantra bajaate the, yahi lut naamak yantra baad main guitar or benzo ke rup main viksit hua
 During his musical composition, Vincenzo Galilei intimately studied the tension of the stringed string or the string and the tones emanating from it, and found that there is a connection between the tension of the string and the string
 pita ke dwaara sangeet ke liye tani huyi dori yaa taar se nikalne vaali dhvaniyon ke antarasambandhon ke parinaamon kaa vaigyanik adhyayan unke putr galileo dwaara kiya gaya
 During the course of this study, the child Galileo was inspired to assimilate his results by doing a thorough experiment in his mind
 inako pariksha mulak vigyaan kaa janak mana jaataa he
 He gave the oscillation formula
 inhone doorabeen kaa avishkaar kiya
 He made the visionary device more advanced
 uski sahaayta se anek khagoleey prekshan liye tathaa copernicus ke siddhanth kaa samarthan kiya
 He is considered the father of modern experimental astronomy
 unhone paaya ki prakruti ke niyam ek duusare karkon se prabhavit hote hai or kisi ek ke badhane or ghatane ke bich ganit ke samikarnon jaise hi sambandh hote he
 That is why he said: - 'the language of God is mathematics
 ‘is mahaan ganitagya or vaigyanik ne hi prakaash kii gati ko naapane kaa saahas kiya
 For this, Galileo and one of his assistants sat on two mountain peaks located several miles away in the dark night
 jahaan se galileo ne laalaten jalaakar rakhi, apane sahaayak kaa sanket paane ke baad unhen laalaten or uske khatke ke madhyam se prakaash kaa sanket dena tha
 His assistant on the second hill had to see the light of the lantern and remove the sign of the second lantern kept near him
 is prakaar duusari pahaad kii chotii par chamakate prakaash ko dekhakar galileo ko prakaash kii gati kaa akalan karnaa tha
 Thus, the results that Galileo achieved were not real to a large extent, but the frequency and success of the experiments, the failure to achieve the desired results only after the failure was unique
 kaalaantar main prakaash kii gati or urja ke sambandhon kii jatil gulthi ko sulajhane vaale mahaan vaigyanik albert ainstin ne isi kaaran unhen ‘aadhunik vigyaan kaa pita ‘ ke naam se sambodhit kiya
 Galileo was religious but wanted to sidestep the old religious beliefs through rationality and experimentation
 varsh 1609 main galileo ko ek aisi doorabeen kaa pataa chalaa jiskaa avishkaar holland main hua tha, is doorabeen kii sahaayta se duurastha khagoleey pindon ko dekh kar unki gati kaa adhyayan kiya ja saktaa tha
 Galileo himself heard this and built a telescope that was more powerful than the indiscriminate telescope in Holland
 iske aadhaar par apane prekshan tathaa prayogon ke madhyam se galileo ne yah paaya ki purv main vyaapt manyataon ke vipareet brihamand main sthit prithvi samet sabhi grah surya kii parikrama karte he
 Earlier, Copernicus also said that all the planets including the Earth revolve around the Sun, for which they had to be angry with the Church
 ab prayog ar vivek par aadhaarit parinaamon ke aadhaar par galiliye ne bhi yahi hona sidv paaya
 Till that time, it was universally accepted that the Earth is located in the center of the universe and all the celestial bodies including the Sun and the Moon revolve around the Earth continuously
 is manyata ko tadsamay ke dharmacharyon kaa samarthan praapt tha
 Due to the results obtained on the basis of his experiments, Galileo decided to stand against the old concepts
 jab galileo ne yah sidwant saarvajanik kiya to carch ne ise apni avagya mana or is avagya ke liye galileo ko carch kii ore se karawas kii sajaa sunaayi gayi
 The idea given by Galileo forced the new man to accept a new form of direction of contemplation
 saamaajik or dharmik pratadna ke chalate purv se vyaapt manyataon or vishwaason ke vipareet pratipaadit sindvanto ke saath ve adhik din tak khadey nahin rah sake
 In 1633, 69-year-old Old Galileo was ordered by the Church to publicly apologize, saying that his doctrine against religious beliefs was the biggest mistake of his life for which he is ashamed
 unhone aisa hi kiya parantu iske baad bhi unhen karawas main daal diya gaya
 His health continued to deteriorate and due to this, the sentence of imprisonment was changed to house-imprisonment i
e
 imprisonment in his own house
 apane jivan kaa aakhri din bhi unhone isi kaid main hi bitaayaa
 The supreme institution of Christianity, always under the supervision of the Pope, in Vatican City, admitted in 1992 that he had made a mistake in deciding Galileo's case
 is prakaar ek mahaan khagol vigyaani, ganitagya, bhautikavid evam darshanik galileo ke sambandh main 1633 main jari aadesh kar apni aitihaasik bhul sweekaar karne main carch ko saade teen sau saalon se bhi adhik kaa samay laga
 Four hundred years after the creation of binoculars and the observation of celestial bodies in the year 1609, the year 400 was celebrated as the International Year of Astronomy as the 400th birth anniversary and paid tribute to this great scientist and tried to make a mistake

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga kuru kshetra kii yubhumi main shrikrishna ne arjuna ko jo upadesh diya tha vah shrimadbhagavadagita ke naam se prasiddh he
 It is part of Bhishma Parva of Mahabharata
 gita main 18 adhyay or 720 shloke hai
 As stated in the Sankara commentary of the Gita - t धर्म Dharmām Bhagavata as specified Ved Vyāsya: Sarvānoghobhāva गीa Geetākhyai: Saptabhi: Shlokashatairu Panibandha
 gyaat hota he ki lagbhag 20veen sadi ke shuru main gita press gorakhpur ke saamne gita kaa vahi paath tha jo aaj hamen uplabdh he
 Around the 20th century, Bhishmaparva had a translation into the language of Java
 usamen anek mulshlok bhi surakshit hai
 According to Shripad Krishna Belvelkar, in this ancient version of Java, only one and a half eighty-one verses of the Gita are of Sanskrit origin
 unase bhi vartmaan paath kaa samarthan hota he
 The Gita is counted in the Prasthanatrayi, which includes the Upanishads and the Brahmasutras
 atev bhartiya parampara ke anusaar gita kaa sthaan vahi he jo upanishad or brahmasutron kaa he
 In the greatness of the Gita, the Upanishads have been called cow and the Gita is its milk
 iskaa taatpary yah he ki upanishdon kii jo aadhyatm vidya thi, usko gita sarvansh main sweekaar karti he
 Many of the Upanishads are in the Gita
 jaise, sansar ke swaroop ke sambandh main ashwatth vidya, anadi ajanma brahm ke vishay main avyayapurush vidya, para prakruti yaa jeev ke vishay main aksharpurush vidya or aparaa prakruti yaa bhautik jagat ke vishay main ksharpurush vidya
 Thus the specific content of both the Brahmanism of the Vedas and the spirituality of the Upanishads is embedded in the Gita
 use hi pushpika ke shabdon main brahmavidya kaha gaya he
 In the Gita, 'theosophy' refers to the retirement of knowledge
 ise sankhyamat kaha jaataa he jiske saath nivrittimargi jeevanapaddati judi hui he
 But the Gita goes beyond the turn of the Upanishads to the era when a new philosophy was being born which considered the propitious religion of the householders as equivalent to the path of isolation and equally fruitful
 isi kaa sanket denevaala gita kii pushpika main ‘yogashastre’ shabd he
 Here 'yogasastra' refers to Karmayog, of course
 gita main yoga kii do paribhaashaayen pai jaati hai
 From the point of view of a retirement path, which has been called 'samatvam Yoga Uchhyate', that is, it is yoga to be equitable in contrasting qualities
 sankhya kii sthiti yahi he
 The second definition of yoga is 'yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam', that is, even while engaged in Karma, do the work in such a way that it is not the cause of bondage and the Karmakar can keep himself in the same dissonance or uninterrupted condition that the Jnanmargis get
 isi yukti kaa naam buddhiyog he or yahi gita ke yoga kaa saar he
 The tune of 'tasya Prajnapratishthita', which is found in the second chapter of the Gita, refers to the potential intelligence of Nirlep Karma
 yah karm ke sanyas dwaara vairaygy praapt karne kii sthiti na thi balki karm karte hue pade pade man ko vairagyavaali sthiti main dhaalane kii yukti thi
 This is the Karma Yoga of the Gita
 jaise mahabharat ke anek sthalon main, vaise hi gita main bhi sankhya ke nivritti maarg or karm ke pravritimarg kii vyakhya or prashansa pai jaati he
 The condemnation of one and the praise of the other is not the opinion of the Gita, both ways can and are beneficial for human beings with two types of interest
 sambhavat: sansar kaa doosraa koi bhi granth karm ke shaastra kaa pratipaadan is sundarataa, is sookshmata or nishpakshta se nahin karata
 From this point of view, Gita is a wonderful human scripture
 isaki drushti ekangi nahin, sarvangpurn he
 The joy of literature while rendering philosophy in the Gita is its additional specialty
 tatvagyan kaa susanskrit kavyastylee ke dwaara varnan gita kaa nijee saurabh he jo kisi bhi sahruday ko mugdh kiye bina nahin rahata
 That is why it was named Bhagavad Gita, the knowledge sung by God
 shrimadbhagavadgita kii prishthbhumi mahabharat kaa yuddh he
 Just as a normal person gets entangled in the problems of his life and after that, he makes up his mind to flee from the life's confluence, similarly Arjun, who is the great hero of Mahabharata, is afraid of the problems facing him and his life and Kshatriya religion
 Disappointed, just like Arjun, all of us sometimes get frustrated either in a state of uncertainty and or because of our problems
 Dismisses off duty
 bharat varsh ke rishiyon ne gahan vichaar ke pashchaat jis gyaan ko aatmsaat kiya use unhone vedon kaa naam diya
 The last portion of these Vedas is known as Upanishad
 maanav jivan kii visheshta maanav ko praapt bauddhik shakti he or upanishdon main nihit gyaan maanav kii bauddhikta kii ucchtam avasthaa to he hi, apitu buddhi kii simaaon ke pare manushya kya anubhav kar saktaa he uski ek jhalak bhi dikhaa detaa he
 The themes mentioned in the 18 chapters of the Gita are also ordered concordantly
 pratham adhyay kaa naam arjunavishadayog he
 He presents a unique theatrical theater of the teachings of the Gita, in which both the listener and the speaker tend to solve the intricate problem of life, not for the sake of peace
 shaury or dhairya, saahas or bal in chaaron gunon kii prabhoot maatra se arjuna kaa vyaktitv bana tha or in chaaron ke upar do gun or the ek kshamaa, duusari pragna
 Arrived in a position derived from Balapradhan Kshatradharma, Arjuna's mind suddenly attacked another type of emotion, Karpanya
 ek vicitra prakaar kii karunaa uske man main bhar gai or uskaa kshaatr swabhaav lupt ho gaya
 He was alienated from the duty for which he was committed
 upar se dekhne par to is sthiti ke paksh main uske tark dharmayukt jaan padate hai, kintu usne swayan hi use carpanya dosha kaha he or yah mana he ki man kii is kaatarata ke kaaran uskaa janmasiddh swabhaav upahat yaa nasht ho gaya tha
 He was not able to decide whether to fight or take restlessness
 kya kare, kya na kare, kuch samaj main nahin aata tha
 Upon reaching the peak of this mood, he put Dhanushbana aside
 krishna ne arjuna kii vah sthiti dekhakar jaan liya ki arjuna kaa sharir thik he kintu yuddh aarambh hone se pehle hi us adbhut kshatriya kaa manobal tut chukaa he
 This body cannot stand without the mind
 atev krishna ke saamne ek guru kartavya aa gaya
 Hence Arjuna's salvation from logic, from intellect, from knowledge, from the discussion of karma, from the nature of the world, from the state of life in him, from the introduction of the regulator Akshay Purush, and from the vision of that supremely supreme authority
 This was his goal
 isi tatvacharchaa kaa vishay gita he
 In the first chapter, Arjuna, as a role in the usual manner, told God his position
 duusare adhyay kaa naam sankhyayog he
 In it, two ancient traditions of life have been described by arguments
 arjuna ko us kripan sthiti main rote dekhakar krishna ne uskaa dhyaan dilaayaa he ki is prakaar kaa clayvy or hriday kii kshudra durbalata arjuna jaise vir ke liye uchit nahin
 Krishna called all the tips given by Arjuna till now a false form of enlightenment
 unki yukti yah he ki pragyadarshan kaal, karm or swabhaav se honevaale sansar kii sab ghatnaon or sthitiyon ko anivaary rup se sweekaar karata he
 Live and die, be born and grow, subjects come and go
 sukh or dukh kaa anubhav, ye to sansar main hote hi hai, isi ko pracheen acharya paryaaywad kaa naam bhi dete the
 The cycle of time brings and takes all these conditions
 jivan ke is swabhaav ko jaan lene par phir shok nahin hota
 This is the satire of God that why even Arjuna has fallen into this kind of fascination, considering Pragya's point of view
 upar ke drushtikon kaa ek aavashyak ang jivan kii nityata or sharir kii anityata tha
 Mourning for the eternal creature is as futile as the worry of saving the eternal body
 ye donon aprihaary hai
 It is not appropriate to grieve as birth and death occur in turn
 phir ek doosraa drushtikon swadharm kaa he
 Since birth, nature has set a religion for everyone
 usamen jivan kaa maarg, ichchhaaon kii paridhi, karm kii shakti sabhi kuch aa jaataa he
 It cannot be escaped
 koi bhaage bhi to prakrutti use phir khinch laati he
 In this way, the change or magnitude of Kaal, the continuity of the living being and the self-righteousness or nature of the tips by which God has explained to Arjuna, he has called the wisdom of Sankhya
 isse aage arjuna ke prashn na karne par bhi unhone yogamarg kii buddhi kaa bhi varnan kiya
 This intellect is the intelligence of the urge of karma or tendency path, while doing karma, it is necessary to protect oneself from attachment to the fruits of karma
 karmyogi ke liye sabase bada dar yahi he ki vah fal kii ichha ke dal dal main fas jaataa he; usase use bachanaa chahie
 Arjuna wondered if it is possible to get this kind of intelligence
 vyakti karm kare or fal na chaahe to uski kya sthiti hogi, yah ek vyaavhaarik shankaa thi
 He asked how does such a strong-minded person behave in life? Coming, going, eating, drinking, doing deeds, how can we be abused even after indulging in them? Krishna has explained the restraint of the mind in comparison to how many external senses
 kaam, krodh, bhay, raag, dwesh ke dwaara man kaa saumybhav bighad jaataa he or indriyaan vash main nahin rahati
 Indrajaya is the biggest self-respect
 baahar se koi vishyon ko chhod bhi de to bhi bheetar kaa man nahin maanata
 When the taste of subjects goes through the mind, then the mind becomes cheerful, calm and happy
 samudr main nadiyaan aakar milti hai par vah apni maryaada nahin chodta
 While living in such a world, accepting its practices, many desires keep entering the mind
 kintu unase jiskaa man apni maryaada nahin khota use hi shanti milti hai
 It is called Brahmi Situation in the Gita in the definition of ancient spirituality
 is prakaar sankhya kii vyakhya kaa uttar sunakar karmyog naamak tisare adhyay main arjuna ne is vishay main or gaharaa utarane ke liye spasht prashn kiya ki sankhya or yoga in donon margon main aap kise acha samajhate hai or kyon nahin yah nishchit kehete ki main in donon main se kise apanaaun? isapar krishna ne bhi utani hi spashtataa se uttar diya ki lok main do nishthaayen yaa jeevandrushtiyaan hai-sankhyavaadiyon ke liye gyanayog he or karmmargiyon ke liye karmyog he
 Here no person can give up karma
 prakruti teenon gunon ke prabhaav se vyakti ko karm karne ke liye baadhya karti he
 There is a great doubt about the survivors of karma, that is that they leave karma from the top, but the mind is immersed in it
 yah sthiti asay he or ise krishna ne gita main mithyaachaar kaha he
 The simple human way is to do karma by stopping the karmadrians in the mind
 krishna ne chunauti ke rup main yahan tak kah diya ki karm ke bina to khaane ke liye ann bhi nahin mil saktaa
 Then Krishna introduced the law of karma as a cycle
 na keval saamaajik dharaatal par bhinn vyaktiyon ke karmchakr aron kii tarah aapas main piroe hue hai balki prithvi ke manushya or swarg ke devtaa donon kaa sambandh bhi karmchakr par ashrith he
 It is obvious that here humans do work, do agriculture, and divine powers send rain water
 ann or parjanya donon karm se utpann hote hai
 Human actions in one, divine actions in the other
 phir karm ke paksh main loksangrah kii yukti di gai he, arthath karm ke bina samaaj kaa dhaanchaa khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Those who are leaders of the world, knowledgeable like Janak also have a tendency in karma
 krishna ne swayan apana hi drushtaant dekar kaha ki main narayan kaa rup hoon, mere liye kuch karm shesh nahin he
 Still i do deeds without sleep and others walk my path
 antar itnaa hi he ki jo murkh hai ve lipt hokar karm karte hai par gyani asang bhav se karm karata he
 In the Gita, here is a well-known word, intelligence
 arthath jo saadhaaran samaj ke log karm main lage hai unhen us maarg se ukhaadnaa uchit nahin, kyonki ve gyanavaadee ban nahin sakate, or yadi unka karm bhi chhot gaya to ve donon ore se bhatak jaayange
 In the fourth chapter, whose name is Jnana-karma-sanyas-yoga, it has been told that by which knowledge the fruits of karmasanyas can be obtained while doing karma
 isamen sachche karmyog ko chakravarti raajaaon kii parampara main ghatit mana he
 Illustrations of several Chakravarti kings such as Mandhata, Sudarshan are given
 yaheen gita kaa vah prasiddh aashwaasan he ki jab jab dharm kii glani hoti he tab tab manushyon ke bich bhagwaan kaa avatar hota he, arthath bhagwaan kii shakti vishesh rup se moort hoti he
 It is here that a sentence deserves special attention - Kshipraman manushe lokay siddhirbhavati karmaja
 ‘karm se siddhi’-isse bada prabhaavshaalee sutara gitadarshan main nahin he
 But Geetatattva improves and corrects this sutra so much that it should be done in a senseless way, that is, from fellowship
 paanchave adhyay main phir ve hi yuktiyaan or drudh rup main kahin gai hai
 In this, special attention has been paid to the rites or purification of the mind which is associated with karma
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki unche dharaatal par pahunchakar sankhya or yoga main koi bhed nahin rah jaataa he
 If you walk properly on any one path, then you get the same result
 jivan ke jitne karm hai, sabko samarpan kar dene se vyakti ekadam shanti ke dhruv bindu par pahunch jaataa he or jal main khile camel ke samaan karm rupi jal se lipt nahin hota
 The sixth chapter is Atamsayam Yoga, whose subject is revealed by name
 jitne vishay hai un sabase indriyon kaa sanyam-yahi karm or gyaan kaa nichod he
 The same state of mind in happiness and in sorrow is called Yoga
 saatven adhyay kii sangya gyanvigyaan yoga he
 These are two definitions of ancient Indian philosophy
 unamem bhi vigyaan shabd vaidic drushti se bahut hi mahatvapurn tha
 The knowledge of the infinitude of the universe is science and progress from monotony to unity is knowledge
 ye donon drushtiyaan maanav ke liye uchit hai
 In this context, the definite explanation of these two forms of placenta and para nature from the point of view of science is definitely worthy of attention
 aparaa prakruti main aath tatv hai, panchabhoot, man, buddhi or ahankaar
 The egg from which a human is born
 usamen ye aathon rahete hai
 But this is the natural canto, ie it is the root
 isamen ishwar kii cheshtaa ke sampark se jo chetana aati he use para prakruti kehete hai; vahi jeev he
 Life becomes the ninth element together with the eight elements
 is adhyay main bhagwaan ke anek roopon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he jinka or vistaar vibhootiyog naamak dasven adhyay main aata he
 There is also a mention of the special Bhagwati vision, which has the same deity in the sutra-vasudeva: sarvamiti, sub vasu or bodies, its noun is Vishnu
 kintu lok main apni apni ru chi ke anusaar anek naamon or roopon main usee ek devtatv kii upasna kii jaati he
 they are all fine
 kintu acha yahi he ki budhimaan manushya us brahmatatv ko pahachaane jo aadhyatm vidya kaa sarvocch shikhar he
 The noun of the eighth chapter is the syllable Brahmayog
 upanishdon main akshar vidya kaa vistaar hua
 In the Gita, the essence of that syllogism has been said - the syllable is the noun syllable of Brahma Paramana, that is, Parabrahma
 manushya, arthath jeev or sharir kii sanyukt rachana kaa hi naam aadhyatm he
 The noun of the living physical body is Kshar and only the noun of power is superficial
 deh ke bheetar jeev, ishwar tathaa bhoot ye teen shaktiyaan milakar jis prakaar kaary karti hai use adhiyagya kehete hai
 The lyricist has tied the form of these six definitions in two verses
 gita ke shabdon main ekakshar brahm he 
 The ninth chapter has been called Rajaguhyayoga, that is, it is spiritual science student and this secret knowledge is the best among all
 raja shabdaka ek arth man bhi tha
 Therefore, how the divine powers of the mind can be made cosmic is its strategy
 is kshetra main brahmatatv kaa nirupan hi pradhan he, usee se vyakt jagat kaa barambar nirmaan hota he
 All the ritualistic rituals of the Veda are Yajna, Amrit, and death, saint and dissent, and all the gods and goddesses, all of whom are in Brahma
 lok main jo anek prakaar kii devpuja prachlit he, vah bhi apane apane sthaan main thik he, samanvay kii yah drushti bhagwat aacharyon ko maanya thi, vastut: yah unki badi shakti thi
 The idea or interpretation of this approach is found in the tenth chapter
 iskaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The essence of it is that all the gods in the world, all are deities of the same God, all the qualities and demerits of a human being are forms of the power of God
 buddhi se in chhutbhaye devataaon kii vyakhya chaahe ne ho sake kintu lok main to vah hai hi
 Someone is worshiping Peepal
 koi pahaad ko koi nadi yaa samudr ko, koi unamem rahanevaale machhlee, kachhuon ko
 There is no end to so many gods
 vishwa ke itihaas main devataaon kii yah bharmaar sarvatra pai jaati he
 Accepting their power, the Bhagavats gave everyone a new vision of coordination, considering them as the form of Vishnu
 isi kaa naam vibhootiyog he
 The entity which is strong or miraculous is the form of God
 itnaa maan lene se chitt nirvirodh sthiti main pahunch jaataa he
 The 11th chapter is titled Vishwaroopadarshan Yoga
 isamen arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa vishwaroop dekha
 Virat Roop means the visible vision of the eternal world above the human plane and periphery
 vishnu kaa jo chaturbhuj rup he, vah maanviya dharaatal par saumyrup he
 When Arjuna saw the great form of God, his forehead exploded
 ‘disho na jane na labhe c shame’ ye hi ghabrahat ke vaakya unke mukh se nikle or usne prarthana kii ki maanav ke liye jo swaabhaavik sthiti ishwar ne rakhi he, vahi paryaapt he
 In the 13th chapter, there is a direct subject area and the idea of the jurisdictional
 yah sharir kshetra he, uskaa jaananevaala jeevatma kshetrajna he
 The name of the 14th chapter is Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga
 yah vishay samast vaidic, darshanik or puranic tatvachintan kaa nichod he-satv, raj, tam naamak teen gun-triko kii anek vyakhyaayein hai
 The name of the equilibrium of qualities is Pradhan or Prakriti

 The solitary entity remains calm like a pure light with a calm nature, and the lonely soul is still idle
 kintu donon ke bich main chaaya hua rajogun unhen cheshtaa ke dharaatal par khinch laata he
 The name of the motion element is Rajas
 15wein adhyay kaa naam purushottamyog he
 In it, the world is described as Ashwattha
 yah ashwatth rupi sansar mahaan vistaarwaala he
 There is no end to this in the country and time
 kintu iskaa jo mul yaa centre he, jise urdhv kehete hai, vah brahm hi he ek ore vah param tej, jo vishwarupi ashwatth ko janm detaa he, surya or chandra ke rup main prakat he, duusari ore vahi ek ek chaitanya centre main yaa praani sharir main aayaa hua he
 As it is clearly stated in the Gita - Ego vishvakanaro bhutva praninam dehamashrit:
 vaishwanar yaa pranmayi chetana se badhkar or doosraa rahasy nahin he
 There are three males or males - Kshar, Akshar and Avayya
 panchabhuton kaa naam kshar he, praan kaa naam akshar he or manastatv yaa chetana kii sangya avyay he
 Human consciousness is born from the collected position of these three males, which the sages have called the global fire
 16wein adhyay main devasur sampatti kaa vibhaag bataaya gaya he
 From the very beginning, the universe has been conceived in Rigdeva as divine and demonic powers

 ek amrit, doosraa martya
 One truth, the other unknowable
 17wein adhyay kii sangya shraddhatray vibhaag yoga he
 It is related to these three qualities, Sat, Raz and Tama, that is, the virtue in which one arises, his devotion or loyalty to life becomes the same
 yajna, tap, daan, karm ye sab teen prakaar kii shraddha se sanchalit hote hai
 Even diet is of three types
 unke bhed or lakshan gita ne yahan bataae hai
 The noun of 18th chapter is moksha sanyasana yoga
 isamen gita ke samast upadeshon kaa saar evam upsanhaar he
 Here again, the importance of three qualities for human life has been said
 prithvi ke maanvon main or swarg ke devataaon main koi bhi aisa nahin jo prakruti ke chalaae hue in teen gunon se bachaa ho
 It is necessary to walk well after watching a man so that he can protect his intellect and instinct from evil and can identify what is work and what is not
 dharm or adharm ko, bandha or moksh ko, vritti or nivritti ko jo buddhi thik se pahachanaati he, vahi saatviki buddhi he or vahi maanav kii sachhee uplabdhi he
 In this way, God has preached the practical path to life and in the end has said that man should faithfully follow all the behaviors of the world, which is the unbroken conscious element, called God, which is the heart of every creature or Sit in the center, believe in it, experience it
 vahi jeev kii satta he, vahi chetana he or vahi sarvopari anand kaa strot he
 In the tradition of Sanskrit literature, those texts are called Bhashya, which presents a broad interpretation or commentary on the meaning of other texts
 bhartiya darshanik parampara main kisi bhi naye darshan ko yaa kisi darshan ke naye swaroop ko jad jamaane ke liye jin teen granthon par apana drushtikon spasht karnaa padataa tha unamem bhagavadgita bhi ek he 
 Many Acharyas and scholars have commented on Gita
 sampradaayon ke anusaar unki sankshipt suchi is prakaar he : Apart from these, there is a famous commentary on the name of Maharashtrian saint Gyandev or Dnyaneshwarite Bhavarthadeepika, which reveals the knowledge of Gita in an emotional poetry style
 vartmaan yug main lokmaanya bal gangadhar tilakkrut gitarahasya tikaa, jo atyant vistrut bhoomika tathaa vivechan ke saath pehali baar 1915 i
 Published in Poona, the Gita occupies an important place in literature
 usne gita ke mul arthon ko vidwaanon tak pahunchaane main aisa mode diya he jo shankaracharya ke baad aaj tak sambhav nahin hua tha
 In fact, Shankaracharya's commentary gives the main meaning of the Gita, while the Tilak proves the Gita as the proponent of karma
 bhagavadgita par uplabdh sabhi bhashyon main shri jaidayal goyandaka kii tatv vivechni sarvaadhik lokapriy tathaa jansulabh he
 It is published by gitapress
 ajtak isaki 10 karod pratiyaan bik chuki hai
 Srimad Bhagavad Gita is maintaining its importance in the changing social scenario and due to this technological development has increased its availability, and tried to make it more comprehensible
 doordarshan par prasaarit dharawahik mahabharat main bhagavadgita vishesh aakarshan rahi, vahiin dharawahik shrikrishna main bhagavadgita par atyadhik vishad shodh karke use kai kadiyon kii ek shrunkhlaa ke rup main dikhaaya gaya
 One of its special things was that attempts were made to answer common man's doubts related to Gita through Arjuna's questions
 iske alaava nitish bharadwaj krit dharawahik gita-rahasy to purnataya gita ke hi vibhinn ayaamon par kendrit rahaa
 Even today many websites on the Internet give detailed information on this subject through multimedia
 shrimadbhagavadgita vartmaan main dharm se zyada jivan ke prati apane darshanik drushtikon ko lekar bharat main hi nahin videshon main bhi logon kaa dhyaan apni or aakarshith kar rahi he
 The Gita's message management of Nishkam Karma is also appealing to the gurus
 vishwa ke sabhi dharmon kii sabase prasiddh pustakon main shaamil he
 The publication which makes books of religious literature like Geeta Press Gorakhpur available at a very low price has also contributed greatly to the general public by publishing Srimad Bhagavad Gita in various shapes and meanings
 gita kaa upadesh atyant puraatan yoga he
 Sri Bhagavan says i first told it to Surya
 surya gyaan kaa pratik he atah shri bhagavan ke vachanon kaa taatpary he ki prithvi utpatti se pehle bhi anek swaroop anusandhan karne vaale bhakton ko yah gyaan de chukaa hoon
 It is a divine voice that has the essence and basis of all life
 main koun hoon? yah deh kya he? is deh ke saath kya meraa aadi or ant he? deh tyaag ke pashchaat kya meraa astitv rahegaa? yah astitv kahan or kis rup main hoga? mere sansar main aane kaa kya kaaran he? mere deh tyaagane ke baad kya hoga, kahan janaa hoga? kisi bhi jigyaasu ke hriday main yah baaten nirantar gumti rahati hai
 We always think about these things and do not know ourselves, our nature
 gita shaastra main in sabhi ke prashnon ke uttar sahaj dhang se shri bhagavan ne dharm samvaad ke madhyam se diye hai
 This body in which the 36 elements work together due to the presence of the soul, is called Kshetra and Jeevatma resides in this Kshetra, he is the lord of this body but there is also a third man, when he appears; Overlive means this body with 36 elements and destroys the individual soul
 yahi uttam purush hi param sthiti or param sat he
 Not only this, the real scientific and rational description of the movement of the soul located in the body and leaving the body is mentioned in the Gita Shastra
 jeevatma nity he or aatma ko jeev bhav kii prapti hui he
 At the death of the body, the individual moves in different vaginas according to his order
 gita kaa prarambh dharm shabd se hota he tathaa gita ke atharahawein adhyay ke ant main ise dharm samvaad kaha he
 Dharma means one who holds or has been held
 dhaaran karne vaala jo he use aatma kaha gaya he or jise dhaaran kiya he vah prakruti he
 The soul is the seed of this world i
e
 father and nature is the vagina that conceives, ie mother
 dharm shabd kaa prayog gita main aatm swabhaav evam jeev swabhaav ke liye jagah jagah prayukt hua he
 It is necessary to understand religion and unrighteousness in this context
 aatma kaa swabhaav dharm he athwa kaha jaay dharm hi aatma he
 The nature of the soul is absolute pure knowledge, knowledge itself is the inexhaustible abode of joy and peace
 iske vipareet agyaan, ashaanti, klesh or adharm kaa dyotak he
 The soul is the source of renewable knowledge
 gyaan shakti kii vibhinn maatra se kriya shakti kaa udai hota he, prakati kaa janm hota he
 The qualities of nature are born of sattva, raja, tam
 satva-raj kii adhikta dharm ko janm detii he, tam-raj kii adhikta hone par asuri vrittiyaan prabal hoti or dharm kii sthapana arthath gunon ke swabhaav ko sthapit karne ke liye, satogun kii vruddhi ke liye, avinashi brahmi sthiti ko praapt aatma apane sankalp se deh dhaaran kar avatar grihan karti he
 The whole Gita is a squeeze of scripture, always keep the intellect subtle and put it in the spirit of Mahabuddhi and keep doing the actions of the world as per your nature in a simple way
 swabhaavgat karm karnaa saral he or duusare ke swabhaavgat karm ko apanaakar chalanaa kathin he kyonki prayek jeev bhinn bhinn prakruti ko lekar janma he, jeev jis prakruti ko lekar sansar main aayaa he usamen saralata se uskaa nirvaah ho jaataa he
 Shri Bhagavan has repeatedly said in the entire Gita Shastra to be self-centered, self-located
 swaabhaavik karm karte hue buddhi kaa anasakt hona saral he atah ise hi nishchayatmak maarg mana he
 Although seen separately, Gyan Yoga, Wisdom Yoga, Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga etc
 have been preached in the Gita, but if considered from a subtle point of view, all yoga can be done by surrendering it to Sri Bhagavan with wisdom
 Nishkam Karma Yoga is proven automatically
 jaise newton ke pehle bhi gurutvkarshan kaa bal kaary karata tha kintu newton ne uganukool shabdaawalee dekar ise vishwa ko "gurutvkarshan ke niyam" ke ghoshit siddhanton se avgat karaayaa, jo newton ke gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In the same way, the knowledge enunciated in the Gita by Sri Krishna was even before Krishna, which is popular today as the Srimad Bhagavad Gita
 
 Shreemadbhagvatgeeta ka bhashya sambhavatah sanskrit ke vyakaranacharya paanini krit astadhayi se prerit hai parantu vibhinah purva ke paandulipi ke samuchit adhyan dwara vishesh arth nikala ja sakta hai
 Sampoorna Bhagwat Geeta PDF in Hindi and Sanskrit mikkinenipallu main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke karnulu jile kaa ek gaanv he
 NNTP · SIP · SSI · DNS · FTP · Gopher · HTTP · NFS · NTP · SMPP · SMTP · SNMP · Telnet khuli pranali antarsampark sandarbh pratimaan, paratdaar sanchaar va sanganak jaal navachaar abhikalp ke liye ek bhavatmak varnan he
 It was developed as an open system non-contact enterprise
 moolbhoot rup main ye jaal sanrachana ko saat paraton main vibhajit kartaahe, upar se neeche ke kram main ye hai, anuprayog, prastutikaran, satr, yatayaat, jaal, saamagree-kadi, va bhautik parat
 Hence, it is often referred to as the "OSI seven fallow paradigm"
 har parat, saidhantik rup se samaan krityon kaa samooh he, jo apane se upar vaali parat ko seva pradaan karata he or apane se neeche vaali parat se sevaayen praapt karata he
 In each layer, an "instance" serves the instances of the top layer and requests the bottom layer to serve
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi jaal main trutiheen sampark pradaan karne vaali parat upar maujuud anuprayogon ko vaanchit path pradaan karata he or yah karne ke liye apane se nichali parat se pulindia lene-dene kaa anurodh karata he taaki path kii saamagree taiyaar ho sake
 Theoretically, two instances in a layer use a horizontal innovation connection of the same layer to interact
 oesai pratimaan kaa istemaal karne kii mukhyatah do vajah hai: Work on the layered paradigm of the mesh structure began in 1977, and the International Organization for Standardization began to structure its OSI framework
 oesai ke do mukhya tukade hai: jaal ke liye ek bhavatmak pratimaan, jise mul sandarbh pratimaan yaa saat partiya pratimaan kaha jaataa he or kuch khaas navachaar
 Note: Standard documents describing the OSI paradigm can be downloaded for free in the name of recommendations of the X

 The ISO / IEC standard provides the ISO equivalent to the OSI model, but not all are free
 oesai sanrachana ke sabhi aayam cycleads jaal ke saath hue anubhavon ke jariye viksit hue, isane antarjaal kii sanrachana ko bhi prabhavit kiya
 The new structure is documented in ISO 7498 and its many appendices
 is pratimaan main, jaal tantra ko paraton main baanta gaya he
 One or more entities in each layer implement the functions of the layer
 har ikai keval apane se thik neeche vaali parat se hi sidhe sampark sadhti he or apane se upar vaali parat ke istemaal ke liye suvidhaayen taiyaar va pradaan karti he
 a unit in one host uses innovations to interact with the same entity in the same layer of another host
 seva paribhaashaayen parat dwaara parat ko pradaan suvidhaon ke bare main bhavatmak varnan karti hai
 The physical layer defines the electrical and physical specifications of the devices
 yah khaastaur par kisi upkaran or bhautik madhyam ke bich ke sambandh ko paribhaashit karti he
 This includes the placement of pins, voltages, cable specifications, mesh hubs, repeaters, mesh cards, host bus adapters and more
 saamagree-kadi parat or bhautik parat main fark samajhane ke liye is baat par dhyaan den ki bhautik parat mukhyatah ek upkaran ke kisi madhyam ke saath vinirdesh se sambandhit he, jabaki saamagree-kadi parat kaa vaasta mukhyatah kai upkarnon kaa ek saajhe madhyam ke saath vinirdesh sehai
 The physical layer tells a device how to transmit something to a medium, or how to receive something from it
 ares-232 jaise maanak vastav main madhyam tak pahunch ko niyantrit karne ke liye bhautik taron kaa istemaal karte hai
 The major services and facilities provided by the physical layer are - samanaantar essiesai basen is parat ke adheen aati hai, haalaanki yah dhyaan dene yogya he ki taarkik essiesai navachaar, yatayaat parat kaa navachaar he, jo is bas ke upar chalata he
 The physical layer of Ethernet innovation is also in this layer, Ethernet comes in both this layer and the material-hardened layer

 Initially this layer was for point-to-point and point-to-multipoint mediums, which are characteristic of large area mediums in the telephone system

echen maanak, jo ki maujuuda taron ke upar drut-gatiya sthaneey kshetra jaal pradaan karata he, ek sampurna saamagree kadi parat pradaan karata he jisamen chaynaatmak doharavasarakta gavaaksh navachaar ke jariye truti sudhaar va bahaav niyantran dono kiye jate hai
 WAA and LAN services - both of which create logical sequences by organizing bits from the physical layer, which are called structures
 bhautik parat kii sabhi bit dhaanchon main nahin jaati hai, kyonki kuch bit vishuddh bhautik parat ke kaamon ke liye hi hoti hai
 For example, every fifth bit of an FDDI bit stream is not used by the layer
 judaav-unmukh dablyueen saamagree judaav navachaar, dhaanchaa banane ke alaava, tratiyaan khojate hai or unhen thik bhi karat sakate hai
 They can also control the transmission rate

 The MAC sub-layer catches errors but does not fix them
 jaal parat ek yaa adhik jaalon ke jariye strot se gantavy ke bich alag alag lambaai kii saamagree maala ko sthanantarit karne ke kaary sambandhi va prakriya sambandhi jariye pradaan karata he
 While doing this, the mesh layer retains the service quality requested by the traffic layer
 jaal parat jaal anumaargan kaa kaam karata he or yah vikhandan or jodne kaa kaam bhi kar saktaa he, tathaa vitaran kii trutiyon kaa byora bhi de saktaa he
 Routers operate in this layer
 ye vistrut jaal main saamagree bhej ke antarjaal ko sambhav banaate hai
 This is a logical addressing method - the values are selected by the mesh engineer
 sambodhan vidhi padanukramavaadi he
 The best example of layer 3 innovation is Internet innovation
 yah saamagree ke judaavheen sthanantaran kaa prabandhan karata he, ek baar main ek oochaal ke saath - praarambhik pranali se pravesh anumaargkat tak, phir anumaark se anumaark tak or phir baahar nikalne vaale anumaark se lakshyit antim pranali tak
 Reliable distribution until the next surge is not its responsibility, the responsibility is only to locate the error pulses so that they can be removed
 agar agle oochaal kaa madhyam maujuuda lambaai kaa pulinda nahin sweekaar saktaa he to ypi kii zimmedaari he is pulindia ko tod ke kai chote pulindia bananaa taaki madhyam inhen sweekaar sake
 Many functions of layer management innovation, as defined in the Management Appendix, ISO 7498 / 4, are part of the mesh layer
 inamen anmargan navachaar, bahu-prasaaran samooh prabandhan, jaal parat jaankaree va truti or jaal parat sambodhan namakaran shamal hai
 The function of payloads makes them members of the mesh layer, not the innovation carrying them
 yatayaat parat prayoktaaon ke bich saamagree kaa aadan pradaan karti he or upree paraton ko vishwasaneey saamagree sthanantaran sevaayen pradaan karti he
 The traffic layer controls the reliability of any link, using flow control, segmentation / partitioning and error control
 kuch navachaar sthit va judaav unmukh hai
 This means that the traffic layer can keep track of partitions and re-send them where errors occurred
 yun to ye oesai sandarbh pratimaan ke adheen nahin bane hai or na hi yatayaat parat kii oesai paribhaasha ko purnatah santusht karte hai, lekin phir bhi parat 4 ke kuch udhaaharan hai vitaran niyantran navachaar va prayokta aankadaarekh navachaar 
 There are five types of engagement-based traffic innovations in real OSI innovations - class 0 to class 4
 kaksha 0 main truti se baahar nikalne kaa koi vidhaan nahin he or isaki sanrachana aise jaal paraton ke liye kii gai thi jo trutahin judaav pradaan kar sakate hai
 Class 4 is closest to TCP, however TCP has some features that the OSI considers in the session layer such as happy ending
 saath hi sabhi oesaitipi judaav aadhaarit navachaar kakshaayen turant saamagree va abhilek simaaon kaa sangrakshan pradaan karti hai, tisipi in donon main so kuch bhi nahin kar saktaa he
 Detailed information about classes TP0-4 is in this table - shaayad yatayaat parat ke bare main sochna kaa acha tarika hoga uski daakkhaane se tulana karnaa, jo ki praapt chitthiyon ke preshan or vargeekaran kaa kaam karata he
 But remember that the post office only manages the envelope of the letter
 unche str kii paraten dohare lifaafon ko sanbhaal sakate hai, jaise ki chadmikrut prastuti sevaayen jo ki keval antim praptakarta hi vichhadmikrut kar saktaa he
 On the other hand, colorless innovations occur in the traffic layer, such as non-ip innovations - ibm's SNA or Navel's IP trap running IPX or full disguise via ipsec
 saadhaaran anumaargan ancapsulation jaal parat kaa navachaar pratithi ho saktaa he, par agar pelod kaa ancapsulen keval antabindu par hi hota he to jiaarai ypi sheershak istemaal karne vaala lekin phir bhi puure dhaanche yaa pulindia ekamusth antabindu tak pahunchaane vaala yatayaat navachaar hi ban jaataa he
 L2TP carries the PPP structure in a traffic truss
 satr parat sanganakon ke bich ke sanvaadon kaa niyantran karata he
 It establishes, manages and terminates connections between local and remote applications
 yah purna-dwaidh, ardh-dwaidh, yaa eksanketan kriya karata he or jaanch bindukaran, sthagan, samaapti va punararambh kii prakriya sthapit karata he
 The OSI paradigm has attributed this layer to a happy completion of sessions that is a feature of delivery control innovation, a function of session checking, pointing and retrieval that is not commonly found in Internet innovations
 satr parat aamtaur par un anuprayog vaataavaranon main vishisht rup se lagu hoti jinamein duurastha vidhi pukaar kaa istemaal hota he
 The presentation layer establishes context between the application layer units, so the top layer units can use different syntax and semantics, provided the rendering service is able to map between the two
 prastutikaran seva saamagree ikaayiyon ko phir satr navachaar saamagree ikaayiyon main parivartit kiya jaataa he or is tarah dher main neeche tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 This layer relieves the discrepancy in content representation - by switching between application and mesh formats
 prastutikaran parat saamagree ko aise rup main prastut karti he jisamen anuprayog parat use sweekaar kar sake
 This layer drafting and camouflaging the material to be sent in the mesh, so that there is no problem of discrepancy
 ise aksar vaakya vinyas parat bhi kehete hai
 The original presentation framework used one of the syntactic notation notations, which included converting an ebcdic-text file into an ASCII file, or streamlining objects to XML or vice versa
 anuprayog parat oesai kii vah parat he jo prayokta ke sabase qareeb he, arthath oesai anuprayog parat va prayokta donon hi sidhe tantransh anuprayog se sidhe sampark karte hai
 This layer interacts with software applications that implement a piece of communication
 aise anuprayog kaarykram oesai pratimaan kii seemaa ke baahar aate hai
 The application layer functions are often to identify communication partners, find the availability of resources, and contemporaryize communication
 sanchaar bhagidaaron kaa pataa lagaate samay anuprayog parat ko yah sunishchit karnaa hota he ki kisi jo anuprayog saamagree preshit karnaa chahta he uske liye sampark bhagidaar koun hai or ve uplabdh bhi hai yaa nahin
 When determining resource availability, the application layer has to decide whether sufficient network resources are available for the requested communication
 sanchaar ko samaakalin banaate, anuprayogon ke bich ke sabhi sanchaar ke liye sahyog kii zarurat hoti he jiskaa prabandan anuprayog parat karata he
 Some implemented examples of the application layer are Telnet, Advanced Text Transfer Innovation, File Transfer Innovation, and Simple Mail Transfer Innovation
 oesai sandarbh pratimaan yaa oesai navachaar main se koi bhi kisi programing antaraprishth ko nirdisht nahin karte hai
 These buses only provide emotional specifications of the service
 navachaar nirdishtataaen spasht rup se alag alag sanganakon ke bich ke antaraprisht ko spasht rup se nirdisht karte hai, lekin ek sanganak ke andar kii tantransh nirdishtataaen har karyanvayan ke liye alag alag he
 For example Microsoft Windows's Winsock and Unix's Berklee socket and System 5's traffic layer interface are the interfaces between applications and traffic
 andiaies va oriai madhyam or jaal navachaar ke bich ke antaraprishth hai
 Except for the medium from the physical layer, all other interface standards are almost exclusively implementations of OSI service specifications
 antarjaal nawacharon ke tisipi / ypi pratimaan main nawacharon ko jaanboojh ke oesai pratimaan kii tarah alag alag paraton main nahin baanta gaya he
 RFC 3439 has a department called "decomposition considered harmful"
 lekin phir bhi tisipi / ypi kaaryaklap ke aadhaar par chaar moti paraton kii pahchaan karata he, jo ki inamen nihit nawacharon ke sanchaalan ke daayre par aadhaarit he
 These scopes are stringency applications, end-to-end traffic linkage, endogenous scope, and finally the scope of direct engagement with other glands in the regional network
 yah pariklpana oesai se alag he, phir bhi isaki oesai parateekaran vidhi se aise tulana hoti he: antarjaal anuprayog parat main oesai kii anuprayog parat, prastuti parat or satr parat ke adhiktam bhaag aate hai
 The end-to-end traffic layer includes the beautiful termination feature of the OSI session layer and the OSI traffic layer
 antarjalikaran parat antarjaal parat oesai kii jaal parat kaa up-samucchy he or kadi parat main oesai jaal-kadi va bhautik paraten aati hai, saath hi oesai kii jaal parat ke bhi kai hisse isamen hai
 These layers form the basis of the original seven-layer innovation paradigm of ISO 7498, not the internal organization of a mesh layer document, etc
 oesai main graahak / upabhokta paraten kaafii sakhti ke saath varnit kii jaati hai, lekin inkaa tisipi / ypi ke maamle ke tha viradhabhas nahin he, kyonki nawacharon ke prayog ko partiya pratimaan ke padanukram kaa paalan karne kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Such examples are also in some routing innovations, or in the description of tunneling innovations, providing a link layer to an application, while the tunnel host innovation may itself be a traffic or application layer
 tisipi / ypi kii sanrachana aamtaur par saralata, prabhaavshaalita va lagu karne kii saralata ke aadhaar par liye gaye faisale pasand karti he

 The oldest book of this information is also known as Natyashastra, the author of which was Bharata Muni

 In 37 chapters, Bharatamuni explores all the facts related to theater actor, acting, dance, lyricism, audience, dasarupaka and rasa nishpati
 bharat ke natya shaastra ke adhyayan se yah spasht ho jaataa he ki naatak kii safalataa keval lekhak kii pratibha par aadhaarit nahin hoti balki vibhinn kalaon or kalakaaron ke samyak ke sahyog se hi hoti he
 These are the two distinctions of Natya and Nritta, visual poetry

 Anukarita is called Nritta, associated with rhythm and rhythm

 Uninterrupted display of emotions is a sattvic act

 chaturvidh abhinay ke sahaayak nrity, geet, vaadya evam gati, vritti, pravriti or asana kaa anusandhan bhi natya ke antargat he
 In this way, by presenting the description of the form and usage of various organs and functions of acting, the scripture which determines the rules and practice related to it is 'natyashastra'
 abhinay ke anuroop sthaan ko natyagrih kehete hai jiske prakaar, nirmaan evam saajasja ke niyamon kaa pratipaadan bhi naatyashaastra kaa hi vishay he
 The description of behavior and interactions of actors and actresses of a diverse range of actors and actresses, and the duties of a director is also included in the wider scope of Natyashastra
 iskaa mukhya uddeshy aihik jivan kii naanaa vednaaon se parishrant janata kaa manoranjan he - yah dev, daanav evam maanav samaaj ke liye aamod pramod kaa saral saadhan he
 It is a captivating research that appeals to the observer class by satisfying the nines and scouring the spirit - it is a chant, 'chakshuskratu', in general affording people of differing interest, irrespective of caste and caste, age, discrimination etc

 vastut: aisa koi shaastra, koi shilp, na koi vidya or na koi kala aisi he jiskaa pratinidhitiv naatyashaastra main na ho
 In this way, the presiding deity of the Natyasastra, who is inspired by the divine divinity, is also conceived, like the preceptors of the other Vedas and Vedangs, whose form is mentioned in the text named 'nrisinaprasad'
 natya sambandhi niyamon kii samhita kaa naam 'naatyashaastra' he
 According to the Indian tradition, the original creator of Natyashastra is considered to be Prajapati himself and has been given special respect for Natyakala by calling it 'natyaveda'
 jis prakaar param purush ke nirishwaas se aavirbhoot vedarashi ke drashtaa vividh rishi prakalpit hai usee tarah mahadev dwaara prokt natyaved ke drashtaa shilaali, krishashv or bharatmuni maane gaye hai

 There are 36 chapters in Natyashastra as a symbol of the 36 basic elements accepted in Pratibhagya philosophy

 Thereafter, in the 29th chapter, various types of dramas are featured

 The last chapter is sub-committal

 vastut: yah granth natyasanvidhan tathaa rassidhant kii moulik samhita he
 Its belief is so high that its sentences are called 'bharatasutra'

 Originally there were 12,000 verses and some passages in this book, that is why it is called 'dwadashasahasri Samhita'
 parantu kalkrmanusaar iskaa sankshipt sanskaran prachlit ho chalaa jiskaa aayam chah hajaar padyon kaa rahaa or yah sankshipt samhita 'shatsahasri' kahalaai
 Bharatmuni is believed to be the pioneer of the Udaya Samhita and has been consulted by the ancient commentators with the titles of 'dwadash Sahasrikar' and 'satsahsrikar'
 jis tarah aaj uplabdh chanakya niti kaa aadhaar vruddh chanakya or smritiyon kaa aadhaar kramash: vruddh vasishtha, vruddh manu aadi mana jaataa he, usee tarah vruddhi bharat kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he
 This does not mean that Vasistha, Manu, Chanakya, Bharata etc
 became two people, but in this context 'vriddha' means perfect codifier

 Thus the symmetry of devotion with Advaita is Bhagavata's own peculiarity
 inhen kaarnon se bhagwat valmikiy ramayana tathaa mahabharat ke saath sanskrit kii 'upjivy' kavyatrayee ke antarbhoot mana jaataa he
