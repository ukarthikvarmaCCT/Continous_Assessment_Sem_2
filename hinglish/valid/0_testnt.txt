 Shuja's eyes were on Bundelkhand and hence he pledged to help Mir Qasim after defeating Hindupati
 is par mir kasim ne kaary sheeghra samaapt karne ke liye swayan hindoopati par chadhaai kar di
 Najaf compromised diplomacy by intimidating Hindupati
 mir kasim vijayi hokar shuja ke paas elahabaad laut aayaa
 Seeing Najaf's successful diplomacy and military aptitude, the British called him from Bundelkhand and joined him before fighting Shuja
 najaf ko shuja se purana bair tha is kaaran usne angrejon ko sahaayta dena saharsha sweekaar kar liya
 From 1764 AD, he became a great assistant to the British

 Seeing his influence and military talent in Delhi, Nawab Wazir Shuja-ud-daulah considered forgetting the enmity and befriending him
 usne najaf ko bhent ke liye aamantrit kiya or use naayab vazeer manonith kiya
 Shuja also prepared him to assist against the Ruhels and by this he persuaded Shah Alam to lead the army

 Setting this limit, Shuja limited Najaf's ambition

 He died in 1782 AD

 vaise to chini main dasiyon hazaar bhavchitra hai, lekin in main se adhiktar keval aitihaasik likhaaiyon main dekhne ko milte hai
 Studies have shown that it is enough to know three to four thousand images to be literate in ordinary Chinese
 har chini bhavchitra ke saath ek uccharan or ek arth judaa hota he or zyaadaatar chini shabd do bhavchitron ke saath likhe jate hai 
 Note that pronunciation varies with the language and language
 yah devanagari lipi ki tarah nahin he ki kisi akshar kaa har jagah vahi uccharan ho
 To understand this, think that if one sees the picture of a mountain, then everyone will understand it, but the Hindi-speaking person will say 'mountain', the Persian-speaking will say 'koh' and the English-speaking will say 'mountain'
 chini bhavchitron ke aksar do yaa teen rup hote hai: Over time, a lot of images had become popular and many of them were complicated to write, so the governments of Japan and China have made some standardizations and simplifications
 is se chini bhashaa ke bahut se shabdon ke do rup hote hai - parmparik chini rup or sarlikrut chini rup
 Japanese and Chinese forms of many words are also similar but slightly different
 chini bhavchitron kii kai shreniyan hoti hai: These were once used to be pictures, but to ease writing and standardize, their appearance has changed a bit
 udhaaharan swaroop, 人 yani 'vyakti', 日 yani 'suraj', 月 yani 'chaand' or 木 yani 'vriksh'
 About 4% of Chinese images belong to this category
 angrezi main is shrenee ke shabdon ko 'pictogram' kehete hai

 jaise ki jahaan 木 kaa arth 'vriksh', vahaan do vrikshon ko jodakar 林 banataa he, jiskaa matlab ' jhuramut' he
 If three trees are written together, it means 'forest'
 usee tarah 刀 kaa matlab to 'chaaku' he lekin isaki dhar par nishaan lagane se 刃 banataa he, yani ' dhar'

 For example, in many Chinese languages, the word 'zee' also meant 'nose' and 'self'

 With the passage of time, the meaning of the 'nose' has been forgotten and in modern Chinese script its meaning is left only to 'itself'

 With this, both the pronunciation and the meaning of the word are known
 udahaaran ke liye 'nadi', 'jhil', 'jharnaa', 'bahut jabardast pani kii dhar, yaa flash kiya gaya pani' or 'phislan' 
 Consider that there are three small ridges on the left side of each sign, which is made by simplifying the picture of 'river'
 is se sanket miltaa he ki shabd 'pani' se sambandhit he
 The right side of the word tells only the sound
 沖 ke dai taraf 中 he, jiskaa arth chini main 'bich' hota he or uccharan 'jhong' hota he
 It can be seen that 沖 is saying 'word related to water, which is pronounced from Zhong', ie 'chong'
 angrezi main aise bhavchitron ke arth bataane vaale hisse ko 'radical' bolte hai or is shrenee ke shabdon ko 'phono-simantic compoundj' kehete hai
 The expressions in this category were first developed during the Shang dynasty and have been found scratched on the bones found in the ruins of that time
 kabhi-kabhi do bhavchitron se ek shabd banataa he jisamen arthbhaag donon bhavchitron par lagu hota he
 For example, there is a Chinese musical instrument, 'beeva' and a fruit is 'lokat'
 in donon ke aakaar dekhne main milte hai
 Biwa was written as 批 把, in which the sign of a hand moving up and down on either side of the two signs is indicated, that is, playing the instrument by moving the hand up and down
 ab isamen 'haath' kaa arthbhaag badalakar 'ped' kaa radical lagane se 枇杷 kaa chihn bana 
 This new two-faced word meant 'fruit of the laukat'
 samay ke saath biva vaadya ke chihn swayan hi badal gaye or aadhunik chini main 琵琶 hai 
 Homogeneous words in languages are those that were once the same but over time their vowels have diverged and sometimes meanings have also changed

 This has happened in the Chinese language also
 masalan 'kaao' or 'lao' kabhi ek hi shabd hua karte the, lekin samay ke saath inke uccharan or bhavchitra donon ek-dusre se bhinn ho gaye hai
 The expressions in this category are few in Chinese script and in English this category is called 'transformed Cognates'

 pakshiyon kaa pravrajan yaa pakshiyon kaa pravaas pakshivigyaan kaa bahut mahatvapurn ang he
 Their migration is as regular and gradual as that of the seasons, and it has elicited curiosity and curiosity in humans since ages, even as the Red Indians have named their calendar months after the arrival of migrating birds
 chidiyon ke pravrajan ke vishay ke maanya pandit landsbaro tomson ne pravrajan kii vyakhya is prakaar kii he: Long ago, it was believed that as some mammals and mammals go into dormancy to avoid frost in the autumn, in the same way that ababil, calvinka and cuckoo also cool
 aisi dharna arestu ke samay se hi chali aa rahi thi
 The ability to move in birds has developed immensely due to the thermal power, wings and amazing power of flight
 yadhyapi anya praaniyon kii apeksha pakshi atyadhik sheet yaa atyadhik ushnata donon ke prati sahansheel hote hai, tathaapi sharad ritu main jab bhojan kaa abhaav ho jaataa he tab unhen baadhya hokar pravrajan karnaa padataa he, anyathaa ve mar jaaen
 Through migration, sparrows also get two favorable areas in two adverse seasons
 ek kshetra main ve nivas karti hai or prajnan karti he or duusare kshetra main bhojan tathaa vishram ke hetu jaati hai
 It is a law of nature that birds lay eggs only in the cold part of the migration zone
 atev uttari golardh main unka mathunakshetra arctic uttari dhruv athwa samshitoshna kshetra hota he, kintu dakshini golardh main iske thik vipareet, sheetakaaleen awaas bumadhya rekha ke sameep hota he
 Often the migration is from north to south, although some migration is also from east to west
 pravrajan kuch kilometre se lekar hajaaron kilometre tak kaa hota he, jaise kuch chidiyaan himalay kii adhik oonchaai se utarkar uttari bharat ke samtal bhaagon main chali aati hai or kuch hajaaron kilometre sudur dakshin main chali jaati hai
 The most distant migration is done by the North Polar Kurri
 yah pravrajan prayek varsh do baar hota he
 It travels southward during the winter of the Arctic, crossing the world and returning to the South Pole Antarctic after spending the summer
 is prakaar jane or aane kii ek ore kii yatra main lagbhag 17,742 kilometre kii duuri tay karti he
 Several theories have been proposed regarding the onset of migration in sparrows
 pravrajan se chidiyon ko nimnlikhit laabh hote hai : The migration of sparrows depends on both internal and external stimuli of the bird
 prayogon se prakat hota he ki bahya uttejnaaon main se din kii avadhi main parivartan pramukh he ; ant : uttejnaa prajnanaangon se utpann hormone dwaara praapt hoti he
 Many experiments and observations of how the target destination of migration is determined and how the birds find their way to this destination have not yet received a satisfactory answer
 sharatkaleen awasakshetra main sharad ritu bitaane ke pashchaat vasant ritu main prajnan kshetra athwa greeshm-awaas-kshetra main vayask naron kaa pratham punaragaman hota he
 This is followed by adult females and finally by the minor sparrows
 kintu sharad main yah kram ulat jaataa he
 First minor birds and females depart for the southern journey and later adult males
 dakshin kii yatra bade itaminaan se or sthaan sthaan par ruk rukkar hoti he
 Young children or teenagers, who are only a few months old, guide the convoy and adults follow them later
 yah kaise hota he? isaki anek vyakhyaayein kii gai hai
 The more accepted opinion among them is that due to the migration of many generations every year, birds have to create a special kind of neem according to the caste tradition, without any prior experience, at the right time, without any prior experience
 Migration of experience has also become an inborn quality
 pakshi sudur pradeshon ke raste kaa kis prakaar pataa lagaate hai? iske vishay main bhi anek anumaan hai jinamein se kuch prithvi ke chumbakatv ke prati sookshm samvedansheeltaa, sthalchihron kii drushti dwaara pahchaan ityadi hai
 But foreseeing, the determination of the distant destination and its path in yesterday's birds remains mysterious
 jis prakaar manushya sudur kii yatra kar phir apane ghar ko laut aata he, thik usee bhanti pakshi hajaaron kilometre kii yatra kar or sharad ritu kisi sudur sthaan main vyateet kar na keval apane greeshm-nivas-kshetra main hi pahunch jate hai, balki apane tyakt ghonsle main bhi pahunch jate hai
 It has been established by the method of ringing the birds that in Europe, the abbeel often reaches not only the same settlement, but the same house to which she left and went on a distant journey
 ababilein is yatra main 9,677 kilometre kii duuri tay karti hai
 The same thing is found in other real migrating birds
 anek varshon ke nirikshan ke falswaroop prakashit kuch gyaat tathyon se pataa chalata he ki chidiyaan na keval apane nivaskshetra or puraane need main hi pahunch jaati he, balki thik usee din lautakar aa jaati hai jis din ve pichley varsh main lautakar ai thim
 Therefore, when traveling for such a long time, it is even more amazing that the birds return to their nests at a certain time
 bharat ke vibhinn kshetron main sharad main aagaman karanevaale prayek sharadyatri pakshi kii sthiti bhinn hoti he
 Take for example any location, such as the Bhopal region of central India
 pakshiyon kii adhikansh jatiyaan, jo uttar yaa uttar pashchim seemaant pradeshon se sharad ritu main, sudur dakshin kii yaa lanka kii, us desh se hokar yatra karti hai, ve bhopal hokar jaati hai
 Some of these travelers are left behind and can be seen in Bhopal throughout the autumn
 inkaa ham vaastavik sharadyatri ke antargat vargeekaran kar sakate hai, kintu kuch keval sharad ritu ke aagaman par thode samay ke liye hi rahete hai or uske baad dikhaai nahin padate kyonki ve vahaan se or aage yatra ke liye prasthaan kar chuke hote hai
 They again appear in early summer, when they return to the north
 ye sharad or vasant main pravrajan karanevaale yatri hote hai
 Some are visible in the autumn, when traveling south, but not visible when they return to their residence again in the spring, because they return via another route
 
 atev ve pakshi bhopal main sharad ritu main dikhaai padate hai or vasant main kisi duusare bhaag main dikhaai padate hai
 Some sparrows migrate from one part to another within the country itself, such as Shah Bulbul or Dudhanju, Golden Polak and Naurang
 yah sthaneey pravrajan desh ke uttari bhaag yaa pahaado kii talahati main adhik hota he, jahaan bumadhyarekha kii apeksha rituparivartan atyadhik prabhavakaari hota he
 Like real migrating birds, these also have a gradual and regular migration
 desh ke kisi bhaag main koi jati greeshm ritu main, koi jati barsaat main or koi jati sharad main aagaman karti he
 Apart from this, there is another type of translocation which happens due to local conditions affecting the diet, such as heat, drought or flood, etc
, or a particular type of flowering and ripening season
 us samay chidiyaan ek kshetra se duusare kshetra main chali jaati hai
 Sometimes sparrows are also found traveling to other areas in search of food, leaving them in their proper habitat, bound by extraordinary circumstances
 atev kisi kshetra main kisi bhi samay main pakshiyon kii jansankhya sthaayee nahin rahati, kyonki sabhi kshetron main pakshiyon kaa aagaman or niryaman sarvada hota rahata he
 The birds living in the high mountains of the Himalayas come down in winter and thus come down from the stormy weather and the Himalayas
 vasant ke aagaman par jab baraf galane lagati he or himrekha upar kii ore bad jaati he, tab ve andey dene ke liye pahaado ke upree bhaag main pun: chadh jaati hai
 This sequence continues not only in birds living in height, but also in birds living below
 chidiyon ke pravrajan kaa vaigyanik gyaan praapt karne ke atirikt prakaar ke avlokanon ke liye bhi britain tathaa america main bahusankhyak chidiyon ke pair main aluminium kii halki or ankit anguuthiyaan pahana di jaati he
 This method is called partisanship or partisanship in the United States
 isamen kramsankhya ke atirikt sthaan kaa pataa bhi ankit rahata he
 The sparrows are put on a ring and their full details are written and left in a booklet
 ab in chidiyon ke sudur sthanon pahunchne par inhen markar athwa phasaakar inaki anguthi utaar lee jaati he or ye jis sthaan se udi thim, us pate par bhej di jaati he
 When a large number of such types of tables are assembled, then these tables are analyzed and based on them, the path of migration of a particular species of bird or any other problem is determined
 atev pashchimi germany or purvi prasha main shwet bak ke balayan ke falswaroop yah nishchit or ni:sandigdh rup se sthapit ho chukaa he ki purvi asia kii chidiyaan dakshin-purvi maarg se balkan hoti hui africa kaa bhraman karti he, jabaki pashchim germany ke shwet bak dakshin pashchimi maarg se spain hokar africa jate hai
 We have come to know from the receipt of similar ringed sparrows in Bikaner that some white bucks that come to our country, in the autumn, are from Germany
 bharat main is prakaar kaa pakshivalayan kaa kaary bahut thodaa hua he
 But the information received from everything that has happened has proved very important and useful
 pravrajan karanevaali chidiyon kii gati vibhinn chidiyon main vibhinn hoti he or yah gati kai baton, jaise vaayu kii disha, mausam ityadi par nirbhar karti he
 Ducks and geese have been found to have a flight speed of 64 to 80 kilometers per hour and 90 to 97 kilometers or more in favorable weather
 din raat nirantar udakar yatra karanevaali chidiyon main yah gati 9
5 se 17
7 kilometre prati ghanta hoti he
 From the following table it can be estimated which distance a bird travels in a single flight: purvi sunaharaa tittibh bina kahin ruke lagaataar udakar 3226
00 kilometre ke khule samudr ko paar kar jaataa he
 These Tittibhas visit India in the autumn
 yah pashchimi alaska or uttar-purv siberia main andey detaa he or hawaii dwipon kaa niyamit rup se bhraman karata he
 The female who wished to lay eggs only in Japan, spends the winter in eastern Australia and Tazmania, thus must fly a distance of 4839
00 kilometers without stopping uninterruptedly
 kuch or bhi aisi chidiyaan he, jo bina dana pani ke bahut badi duuri paar jaati hai
 Among the Indian birds traveling far and wide, perhaps the Bhandu pheasant is the closest place to lay eggs in the Himalayas
 kuch jhandu teetar jaada nilgiri athwa dakshin kii anya pahadiyon main bitaate hai or uske bich anya kahin nahin milte
 This is so clear that they must cross at least 2419
5 kilometers in one flight
 pehle aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki pravrajan karanevaali chidiyaan bahut oonchaai par udati hai, kyonki isse unako, sthaan kaa nirdhaaran karne, hawa ke dwaara utpann avrodh kam hone, ityadi kaa laabh hota he
 But now it has been found that these migratory birds fly at an altitude of 396
24 meters if they do not cross any high mountain, and rarely the bird is raised to a height of 914
4 meters
 jab samudr paar karnaa hota he athwa yahan kisi prakaar ke vriksh yaa pahaad kaa avrodh nahin hota, tab kuch chidyaan swabhaavat: isse bhi kam oonchaai par udati hai
 Yes, birds can fly from very high altitudes if needed

6000 meter tak kii oonchaai par udne kaa ullekh paaya jaataa he
 Kaparkachari is a genus of the genus Zingibraceae, whose botanical name is Hedichium spiketum

 Even in cases where dtds were read, drivers are often limited by the standard time-limit denominator that horizontal / vertical resolution must be fully divisible by 8
 This means that many graphics cards, most common flat panel displays with wide screens, and liquid crystal displays, cannot express the basic differences of television
 The number of vertical pixels is calculated by the horizontal resolution and the selected aspect ratio

 Some panels advertise only slightly less resolution than the original resolution, such as 1360x765
 In order for these panels to be able to display a pixel-accurate image, the EDID data must be neglected by the display driver or the driver must correctly interpret the DTD and be able to troubleshoot the resolution, which is divisible by 8
 Don't be Special programs are available to override standard timelines from EDID data; Powerstrip for Microsoft Windows and switchrex for Mac OS X
 However, this is not always possible as some vendors require specific registry hacks for graphics drivers to implement the resolutions of their choice, which can make it very difficult to use the original resolution of the screen
