 It measures the rate at which a function increases with a variable amount

06 Budhari Bujurg is a village in Atrauli, Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh
 vaisheshik hinduon ke shaddarshanon main se ek darshan he
 Its original promoter is the sage Kanad
 yah darshan nyaay darshan se bahut samya rakhata he kintu vastav main yah ek swatantra bhautik vigyaanvaadee darshan he
 Maharishi Kanad first wrote the ideas of this type of self-realization
 kanad ek rishi the
 These were "hereditary" and used to do austerity by collecting grains of grain and eating it
 isi liye inhen "kanad" yaa "kambhuk" kehete the
 Some have said that they have given a subtle idea of particle i
e
 atomic element, hence they are called "kanad"
 kisi kaa mat he ki din bhar ye samadhi main rahete the or raatri ko kanon kaa sangrah karte the
 This instinct is that of the "owl" bird
 kis kaa kahana he ki inaki tapasya se prasann hokar ishwar ne uluk pakshi ke rup main inhen shaastra kaa upadesh diya
 For this reason, this philosophy is famous by the names of "aulukya", "kanad", "vaishika" or "pashupat" philosophy
 pathan-pathan main vishesh prachlit na hone ke kaaran vaisheshik sutron main anek pathbhed hai tathaa 'trutiyaan' bhi paryaapt hai
 Some of its formulas, like the Mimamsutras, contain repetitions - such as "general specifics", "general specifics": "," tattvam bhaven "," dravatyavatyanatave vayana lakhyate "," doubtful explanation: "
 iske namakaran ke do kaaran kahe jate hai - They have considered a substance called "special" in order to separate each routine substance and to separate the actual nature of each element separately; "dvitv", "pakajotpatti" evam "vibhaagaj vibhaag" in teen baton main inkaa apana vishesh mat he jisamen ye drudh hai
 The idea is that while Vaishika's philosophy is engaging in the consideration of practical elements, even if it remains largely the same in a broad sense, each object is different from the other
 inhone iske parichaayak ekmaatr padaarth "vishesh" par bal diya he, isliye pracheen bhartiya darshan kii is dhara ko "vaisheshik" darshan kehete hai
 Other scriptures have not discussed this
 par ukt kuch kaarnon se is darshan ko "vaisheshik darshan" kii sangya di gai he
 Both Vaishika and Nyaya are philosophies
 vyaavhaarik jagat ko yah vaastavik maanate hai
 They consider a deep and close connection in the concept of external world and inner world
 bahya jagat vichaar par nirbhar nahin he, yah swatantra he
 For 'self-realization', it is equally necessary to get knowledge of all the small and big, elemental and frivolous objects of the world
 in tatwon ke gyaan ke liye pramaanon kii apeksha hoti he
 In jurisprudence, special consideration has been given to proof, but in Vaishika philosophy mainly the idea of 'theorem' has been emphasized
 yahan samaran karana aavashyak he ki nyaay kii tarah vaisheshik bhi, loukik drushti hi se vishwa ke 'vaastavik' tatwon par darshanik vichaar karata he
 He never ignores the real conditions of the cosmic world, however, where the idea of an element cannot be without a subtle vision, there is some way to establish his theory based on senses, imperishable, subtle, yogic etc
 Has a nature, otherwise their ideological reefs would have been contradictory; As a result, acceptance of the elements like atom, sky, time, space, soul, mind, etc
 is equally present in this philosophy
 vaisheshikon ke swaroop, vesh tathaa aachaar aadi 'naiyayikon' kii tarah hote hai; jaise, ye log shaiva hai, inhen shaiva-diksha di jaati thi
 There are four major differences - Shaiv, Pashupat, Mahavratadhar, and minor differences like Kalmukh and Bharata, Bhaktar, etc
 are also found
 vaisheshik vishesh rup se "pashupat" kahe jate hai
 
 vaisheshik mat main samast vishwa "bhav or abhaav" in do vibhaagon main vibhajit he
 There are six divisions of "bhava" - whose names are matter, quality, action, general, special, and collective
 abhaav ke bhi chaar up-bhed hai - pragabhav, pradhvansabhaav, atyantabhaav tathaa anyonyabhaav
 In the texts, their characteristics etc
 are obtained like this: dravyajisamen "dravyatv jati" ho vahi dravya he
 Equalization of work is called Dravya
 dravya gunon kaa aashray he
 Earth, water, tejas, air, sky, kaal, dikha, soul and mind are called nine "matter"
 inamen se pratham chaar dravyon ke nity or anitya, do bhed hai
 The regular form is called the "atom" and the infinite form is the work
 chaaron bhuton ke us hisse ko "parmaanu" kehete hai jiskaa pun: bhaag na kiya ja sake, atev yah nity he
 Apart from Prithvi Pramanu, the properties of other atoms are also constant
 jisase gandh ho vah "prithvi", jisamen sheet sparsh ho vah "jal" jisamen ushn sparsh ho vah "tejas", jinamein rup na ho tathaa agni ke sanyog se utpann na hone vaala, anushna or asheet sparsh ho, vah "vaayu", tathaa shabd jiskaa gun ho arthath shabd kaa jo samavayikaran ho, vah "akaash" he
 These are also called 'panchabhut'
 akaash, kaal, dik tathaa aatma ye chaar "vibhu" dravya hai
 Man is non-material atom and also continual
 aaj, kal, is samay, us samay, maas, varsh, aadi samay ke vyavhaar kaa jo saadhaaran kaaran he- vah kaal he
 The period is constant and extensive
 purv, pashchim, uttar, dakshin, aadi dishaao tathaa vidishaao kaa jo asaadhaaran kaaran he, vah "dik" he
 It is also regular and comprehensive
 aatma or manas kaa swaroop yahan nyaayamat ke samaan hi he
 Asymmetry of virtue is "virtue"
 rup, ras, gandh, sparsh, sankhya, pariman, pruthaktv, sanyog, vibhaag, paratv, apratv, gurutv, dravatv, sneh, shabd, gyaan, sukh, du:kha, ichha, dwesh, praytn, dharm adharm tathaa sanskaar ye choubees gun ke bhed hai
 Of these, from form, smell, juice, touch, affection, natural fluidity, words and knowledge to the sacrament, these are the "peculiar qualities", the residual ordinary qualities
 gun dravya hi main rahete hai
 The function is called "karma"
 upar phenkna, neeche phenkna, sikudna, failaana tathaa gaman, jaise bhraman, spandan, rechan, aadi, ye paanch "karm" ke bhed hai
 Karma remains in matter only
 saamannek vastuon main jo ek si buddhi hoti he, uske kaaran prayek ghat main jo "yah ghat he" is prakaar kii e si buddhi hoti he, uskaa kaaran usamen rahanevaala "saamaanya" he, jise vastu ke naam ke aage "tv" lagaakar kaha jaataa he, jaise - ghatatv, patatv
 "tv" means knowledge of all persons under that caste
 yah nity he or dravya, gun tathaa karm main rahata he
 The more accommodating is called "normal", "normal" or "normal" or "power over"
 sattasamanya dravya, gun tathaa karm in teenon main rahata he
 What is common in every object and teacher is called "upper normal" or "normal special"
 ek vastu ko duusari vastu se pruthak karnaa saamaanya kaa arth he
 One who lives in the last department of specialties and one who lives in routine is called "special"
 nity dravyon main paraspar bhed karanevaala ekmaatr yahi padaarth he
 It is infinite
 samavyek prakaar kaa sambandh he, jo avyav or avyavi, gun or guni, kriya or kriyavan jati or vyakti tathaa vishesh or nity dravya ke bich rata he
 He is one and also continual
 kisi vastu kaa na hona, us vastu kaa "abhaav" kaha jaataa he
 There are four distinctions - "prague lack" is the first reason for the work to arise, the absence of that work, the absence of that work when the "absence lack" work, "extreme lack" in all the three periods which are completely lacking, such as Vandhya's son and "non-interdependence" are mutual absence, such as lack of septum in ghat and non-depletion of pat
 ye sabhi padaarth nyaayadarshan ke pramayon ke antargat he
 Therefore, they do not have a separate view in the judiciary, but they are mainly considered in Vaiseshika philosophy
 vaisheshik mat ke anusaar in saaton padaarthon kaa vaastavik gyaan praapt karne se mukti milti he
 Even though there is so much difference in the nature of substances between these two similar elements, both philosophies remain in the same, it is because the main theorem of both scriptures is "soul"
 aatma kaa swaroop donon darshanon main ek hi sa he
 The other subject is - the remedy to know the same soul
 usamen in donon darshanon main vishesh antar bhi nahin he
 There is a difference between words only and sometimes in process
 fal main bhed nahin he
 Therefore, according to the Judgment, from the philosophy of sixteen substances like proof, theorem, etc
 one gets the same kind of "liberation" from both
 donon kaa drushtikon bhi ek hi he
 In the Nyaya Vesika doctrine, earth, water, light and air also exist in the form of these four substances
 in laagon kaa mat main sabhi kaary dravyon kaa naash ho jaataa he or ve parmaanu rup main akaash main rahete hai
 This state is called "holocaust"
 is avasthaa main prayek jeevatma apane manas ke saath tathaa purv janmon ke karmon ke sanskaron ke saath tathaa adrusht rup main dharm or adharm ke saath vidyaman rahati he
 But at this time there is no work of creation
 kaaran rup main sabhi vastuen us samay kii pratiksha main rahati hai, jab jeevon ke sabhi adrusht kaary rup main parinat hone ke liye tatpar ho jate hai
 But there is an unseen root, even if the body is not there, the individual soul cannot do any work, atoms etc
 are all roots, then how should the action for "creation" arise? iske uttar main yah jaananaa chahie ki utpann honevaale jeevon ke kalyaan ke liye paramatma main sristi karne kii ichha utpann ho jaati he, jisase jeevon ke adrusht karyonmukh ho jate hai
 a type of action occurs in atoms, whereby one atom is combined with another atom
 do parmaanuon ke sanyog se ek "dravyanuk" utpann hota he
 The two atoms that are assembled to generate the earthly body are earthly atoms
 ve donon utpann hue "davyanuk" ke samavayikaaran hai
 The combination of both of them is asymmetric and unfriendly, God's will, etc
 isi prakaar jaleey, taijas aadi sharir ke sambandh main samajhnaa chahie
 It should be remembered that both homogeneous atoms are not created by mere creation
 unke saath ek vijaateey parmaanu, jaise jaleey parmaanu bhi rahata he
 The "mass" has a molecule, so it is not visible
 "davayanuk" se jo kaary utpann hoga vah bhi anupariman kaa hi rahegaa or vah bhi drushtigochar na hoga
 Therefore, the help of "three numbers" is taken to generate macro function from the atmosphere
 nyaay-vaisheshik main sthool dravya, sthool dravya kaa mahat parimanwale dravya se tathaa teen sankhya se utpann hota he
 Therefore, three numbers of the davyanukas generate the gross matter "trianuk" or "trishrenu"
 chaar tryanuk se chaturanuk utpann hota he
 In this sequence, earth and earthly substances are generated
 dravya ke utpann hone ke pashchaat usamen gunon kii bhi utpatti hoti he
 This is the process of creation
 sansar main jitani vastuen utpann hoti hai sabhi utpann hue jeevon ke bhoga ke liye hi hai
 The organism arises in the world due to the effects of deeds of its former birth
 usee prakaar bhoga ke anukool uske sharir, yoni, kul, desh, aadi sabhi hote hai
 When that special enjoyment ceases, then he dies
 isi prakaar apane apane bhoga ke samaapt hone par sabhi jeevon kii mrityu hoti he
 Nyayamat - There is also a sequence for "destruction"
 kaary dravya main, arthath ghat main, prahaar ke kaaran uske avyavon main ek kriya utpann hoti he
 By that action the department is in its components, the department eliminates the initiator combinations of the component
 or phir ghat nasht ho jaataa he
 In this sequence, all the work materials are destroyed at one time by the will of God
 isse spasht he ki asamavayikaaran ke naash se kaarydravya kaa naash hota he
 Sometimes the termination of the termination is also destroyed by the destruction of time
 inkaa dhyey he ki bina kaaran ke naash hue kaary kaa naash nahin ho saktaa
 Therefore, for the destruction of the universe, the action is produced in the atom itself and the atom is eternal, it is not destroyed, but the combination of two atoms is destroyed and then the "mass" form produced from it works and in the same order " "trinity" and "chatrunuk" and other works are also destroyed
 naiyayik log sthool drushti ke anusaar itnaa sookshm vichaar nahin karte
 In his opinion, once the gross matter is destroyed by mere shock
 kaary dravya ke naash hone par uske gun nasht ho jate hai
 There are also two previous opinions in this which have been represented in the "process of cooking"
 nyaay mat kii tarah vaisheshik mat main bhi buddhi, uplabdhi, gyaan tathaa pratyay ye samaan arth ke bodhak shabd hai
 In other philosophies, all these words are used in different terminological meanings
 buddhi ke anek bhed hone par bhi pradhan rup se iske do bhed hai - "vidya" or "avidya", avidya ke chaar bhed he - sanshay, viparyay, anadhyavsaay tathaa swapn
 Doubts and reversals have been represented in justice
 vaisheshik mat main inke arth main koi antar nahin he
 Indeterminate knowledge is called "non-occupation"
 jaise - katahal ko dekhakar vahik ko, ek sasna aadi se yukt gaay ko dekhakar narikel dweepavasiyon ke man main shankaa hoti he ki yah kya he? All the parts of the body get tired by working throughout the day
 unako vishram kii apeksha hoti he
 The senses are especially tired and absorbed in the mind
 phir man manowh naadee ke dwaara puritat naadee main vishram ke liye chalaa jaataa he
 Before reaching there, due to the rites of pre-work and the dissatisfaction of vat, pitta and kapha, the support of the unseen is revealed to the mind at that time by a variety of subjects, which is called dream knowledge
 yahan itnaa dhyaan main rakhana chahie ki vaisheshik mat main gyaan ke antargat ho "avidya" ko rakhaa he or isiilie "avidya" ko "mithyaa gyaan" bhi kehete hai
 Many say that these two words are against each other
 jo mithyaa hai, vah gyaan nahin kaha ja saktaa or jo gyaan he, vah kadaapi mithyaa nahin kaha ja saktaa
 There are also four types of learning - direct, inference, memory and joy
 yahan yah dhyaan main rakhana he ki nyaay main "smriti" ko yatharthagyan nahin kaha he
 That is the knowledge of the known
 isi prakaar "aarsh gyaan" bhi naiyayik nahin maanate
 The words or arrivals of the Nāyayikas have been inferred by the Vaishyāsikas in the estimation and the Upaman in direct
 veda ke rachnewale rishiyon ko bhoot tathaa bhavishya kaa gyaan pratyaksh ke samaan hota he
 It does not require approximation of sense and meaning
 yah "pratibh" gyaan yaa "arshgyaan" kehalaata he
 This knowledge also sometimes occurs in a pure living being
 jaise - ek pavitra kanya kahati he - kal mere bhai aavenge or sachmuch kal uske bhai aa hi jate hai
 This is "primordial knowledge"
 pratyaksh or anumaan ke vichaar main donon darshanon main koi bhi matbhed nahin he
 Therefore, they were not considered again here
 karm kaa bahut vistrut vivechan vaisheshik darshan main kiya gaya he
 These people also accept the five distinctions of "karma" as stated in the Nyaya Darshan in the same sense
 kayik cheshtaaon hi ko vastut: in logon ne "karm" kaha he
 Yet all efforts are made with the same effort
 atev vaisheshik darshan main ukt paanch bhedon ke prayek ke saakshaat tathaa parampara main praytn ke sambandh se koi karm prayatnpurvak hote hai, jinhen "satpratyay-karm" kehete hai, koi bina praytn ke hote hai, jinhen "asatpratyay-karm" kehete hai
 Apart from these, there are some such deeds, such as those in the earth, which are without any effort, are called "untimely deeds"
 in sab baton ko dekhakar yah spasht he ki vaisheshik mat main tatwon kaa bahut sookshm vichaar he
 Nevertheless, in the opinion of justice in worldly matters, Vaiseshika is very much agreed
 atev ye donon "samantantr" kahe jate hai
 In these two philosophies, there is a mention of some distinctions in which there is a "distinction"
 is prakaar ke donon shaastra katipay siddhanton main bhinn-bhinn mat rakhte hue bhi paraspar sambhddha hai
 Their other principles are mutually applicable

 Symptoms of peritoneal mesothelioma include weight loss and cachexia, abdominal swelling and pain due to ascites
 peritoneal mesothelioma ke anya lakshanon main aanton main rukawat, khun jamane main samasya, raktaalpata or bukhaar shaamil ho sakate hai
 If the cancer has spread beyond the mesothelium to other parts of the body, its symptoms may include pain, difficulty swallowing, and swelling of the neck or face
 ye lakshan mesothelioma yaa anya, kam gambhir sthitiyon ke kaaran utpann hue ho sakate hai
 Mesothelioma affecting the pleura can cause these signs and symptoms: gambhir maamalon main, vyakti ke sharir main tumor bhi ban saktaa he
 The condition of pneumothorax in the person, or the lung stops functioning, may also occur
 rog bad saktaa he or sharir ke anya bhaagon tak fail saktaa he
 Tumors that affect the stomach usually do not produce any symptoms until they reach a much later stage
 Symptoms include: rog ke gambhir maamalon main, nimnlikhit sanket va lakshan maujuud ho sakate hai: Mesothelioma does not usually spread to the bones, brain, or adrenal gland
 Lung tumors are usually found only on one side of the lungs
 esbestus ke saath kaary karnaa mesothelioma ke liye pramukh jokhim kaarak he
 In the United States, asbestos is the leading cause of malignant mesothelioma and is considered "indisputably" associated with the development of mesothelioma
 vastutah esbestus or mesothelioma ke bich sambandh itnaa adhik gaharaa he ki kai log mesothelioma ko ek "sanket " yaa "paharedaar " tumor hi maanate hai
 In most cases, a history of contact with asbestos is found
 haalanki, kuch logon main esbestus se kisi gyaat sampark ke bina bhi mesothelioma hone kii jaankaree mili he
 In rare cases, mesothelioma has also been associated with radiation therapy, inhalation of intrapleural thorium dioxide and other fibrous silicates, such as erionite
 kuch adhyayan darshaate hai ki simian virus esavi40 mesothelioma ke vikaas main ek sahaayak kaarak ke rup main kaary kar rahaa ho saktaa he
 Asbestos was also known in ancient times, but it was not extracted from the mines until the nineteenth century and was not widely used commercially
 dwitiya vishwa-yuddh ke dauraan iskaa prayog bahut adhik bad gaya
 Millions of American workers had been exposed to asbestos particles since the early 1940s
 prarambh main, esbestus ke sampark main aane ke jokhimon kii jaankaree saarvajanik taur par uplabdh nahin thi
 However, it was later found that ship factories, people working in asbestos mines and mills, producers of asbestos products, workers in the heating and construction industries, and other occupants are at a much higher risk of developing mesothelioma
 aaj sanyukt rajya america ke ocupational sefti and health administration tathaa sanyukt rajya america ke ipie kaa aadhikarik drushtikon yah he ki amareeki kanoonon ke dwaara aavashyak bataaye gayi suraksha maapdand or "anumatiyogy sampark simaaen", haalanki esbestus-sambandhi adhikansh gaiyr-asaadhya rogon ko roak paane ke liye paryaapt hai, lekin phir bhi ve esbestus sambandhi canceron, jaise mesothelioma, ko roak paane yaa uske prati suraksha pradaan kar paane ke liye paryaapt nahin hai
 Similarly, the Health and Safety Executive of the British Government has formally stated that any threshold for mesothelioma should be at a very low level and it is widely accepted that even if such a limit exists, Currently it cannot be quantified
 Therefore, for practical purposes, the HSE assumes that no "safe" boundary exists
 anya logon ne bhi yah paaya he ki aisi kisi seemaa kii upasthiti kaa koi pramaan maujuud nahin he, jiske neeche mesothelioma kaa jokhim na ho
 It appears that there is a linear relationship between the dose of the drug and its response, according to which the disease also increases with increasing the dose of the drug
 iske baavjood, mesothelioma ko esbestes ke sankshipt, nimna-stareey yaa apratyaksh sampark se joda ja saktaa he
 The dose required for the effect appears to be lower for asbestos-induced mesothelioma than for pulmonary asbestosis or lung cancer
 punah esbestus se sampark ke liye koi surakshit str nahin he kyonki yah mesothelioma ke bade hue jokhim ke saath sambandhit he
 The duration of exposure to asbestos to produce mesothelioma can be short
 udaahranarth, keval 1-3 maah ke sampark main bhi mesothelioma utpann hone ke maamle lekhabaddh kiye gayi hai
 People working with asbestos wear personal protective equipment to minimize the risk of exposure to it
 vilambtaa kii avadhi, pehle sampark se lekar rog ke aavirbhaav tak kaa samay, mesothelioma ke maamle main lambii hoti he
 Almost never it is less than fifteen years, while its maximum level is 30–40 years

 Asbestos can occur in many building materials used in both public and private premises before the asbestos was banned
 marammat kaa kaary yaa diaivay gatividhiyaan kar rahe log esbestus ke sampark main aa sakate hai
 In the UK, the use of chrysotile asbestos was banned in late 1999
 san 1985 ke aasapaas euke main bhure or nile esbestus par pratibandh laga diya gaya
 Buildings constructed or refurbished before these dates may contain asbestos materials
 mesothelioma kaa nidaan kar paanaa aksar kathin hota he kyonki iske lakshan anek anya bimariyon ke lakshanon jaise hi hote hai
 Diagnosis begins with a review of the patient's medical history

 a biopsy can be done in a variety of ways, depending on where the abnormal area is located in the body
 yadi cancer seene main ho, to chikitsak thoracoscopy kar saktaa he
 In this method, the doctor makes a small incision in the chest wall and inserts a thin, lighted tube into the chest between the two ribs, called a thoracoscope
 thoracoscopy ke dwaara chikitsak seene ke bheetar dekhtaa he or utakon ke namoonay praapt karata he
 Alternatively, the chest surgeon can open the chest directly
 If the cancer is in the abdomen, the doctor may perform a laparoscopy
 pareekshan ke liye utak praapt karne ke liye, chikitsak pet main ek chota chira lagaakar udar-bhaag main ek vishesh upkaran daalata he
 If these methods cannot provide sufficient tissue, more extensive diagnostic surgery may be required

 ayurveda main chikitsa armbh karne ke pehle rogapariksha tathaa rogipariksha karne kaa praavdhaan he
 That is, pre-medical examination is very important
 pariksha kii jahaan tak baat aati he to pariksha rogi kii bhi hoti he or rog kii bhi
 Successful treatment can be done only by examining both the patients and by knowing their strength
 ayurvedacharyon ne rog kii pariksha hetu nidaanpanchak kaa varnan kiya he
 According to Ayurveda, the disease is tested by these five measures - in paanch upayon ko nidaanpanchak kehete hai
 Diagnosis - The cause of the disease is called diagnosis
 purvarup - rog utpann hone ke pehle jo lakshan hote hai unhen purvarup kaha jaataa he
 Roop - The signs of diseases that are caused are called symptoms or forms
 upshay - aushadh, ann va vihaar ke parinaam main sukhprad upyog ko upshay kehete hai
 Acquisition - From the earliest stages of the disease to the complete manifestation of the disease, there are six stages of the disease
 nidaanpanchak se rog ke bal kaa gyaan hota he
 Along with this, knowledge of the strength of the patient is also necessary for the treatment
 jisase yah nirnay hota he ki rogi chikitsa sahan karne yogya he athwa nahin
 For this, the description of the Daswadhi examination has come under which the rest of the examination is to know the strength of the patient, except for the pathology examination
 agyaat vyaadhi main vyaadhi ke gyaan ke liye, tathaa gyaat rog main chikitsa ke liye, upshay kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 There are six types of appendages
 aushadh, ann va vihaar se guneet hone par upshay ke 18 bhed ho jate hai, jo 18 prakaar kii chikitsa paddatiyaan hai
 Among these types are Naturopathy, Homeopathy and HIV
 Principles of different medical practices exist
 jaise, upshay ke ek pramukh bhed 'vyaadhivipareet' par aadhaarit chikitsa paddati allopathy he jo multah lakshanon ke vipareet chikitsa he
 The only symptom is immediate suppression of the disease with the opposite drug, but the goal of the therapy, the accomplishment of 'dhatusam Satya' is uncertain
 ayurveda main bhi vyaadhivipareet chikitsa kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he, jaise atisar ke veg ko rokane ke liye stambhan aushadhi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he parantu mahatvapurn baat yah he ki uskaa koi hanikaarak said effect nahin hota
 Allopathy would have been acceptable even if it was only symptomatic treatment, but it is harmful and harmful, so it is destructive and Ayurveda does not consider such a side effect therapy as 'medicine'
 rog kii ati praarambhik avasthaa se lekar rog ke purna rup se pragat hone tak, rog ke kriyaakaal kii chah avasthaayen hoti hai- Accumulation of doshas, outbreaks, pranks and location contamination are the complete condition of diseases
 abhivyakti main rog ke lakshan utpann ho jate hai or rog prakat ho jaataa he
 Distinction is a chronic state of disease
 arthath dosha kaa sanchay, prakope, prasar, sthansanshray, vyakti or bhed ko jo jaanata he vahi yatharth vaidya he
 Tridosha imbalance is diagnosed at the earliest stage of the disease by following measures, without any blood test or X-ray, etc
 The disease is diagnosed by pulse test, stool, urine, eye, tongue, tone, touch and shape test
 yathasambhav purv-purv avasthaaon main hi chikitsa karne ko uttam mana jaataa he kyonki yadi sanchay 
 If treatment is done within the period, then the defect will not progress nor will disease arise

 Take a look again at that point
 It is our home


 our land
 Every person you love, whom you know, whom you have heard of, who ever was born, spent his entire life at this point
 All our joys and sorrows, thousands of religions and beliefs, every hunter, brave and coward, every king and farmer, every young couple in love, every mother and father, every child and scientist full of expectations, every teacher, every teacher Corrupt leaders, every 'superstar', every saint and sinner in our history lived there - on that particle of dust floating in a ray of sun

 un anginat atyaacharon ke bare main socho jo is bindu ke ek kone main rahane vaale logon ne kisi duusare kone par rah rahe apane hi jaise logon par kiye
 hamaari kitni galatchhemiyaan hai, ek duusare ko maar daalane kaa kitna utavlaapan he, duusare insaanon ke prati kitni nafrat he! We dupes humans, our pride, our illusion that we have a special place in the entire universe, this dull light point challenges all these things
 Our planet is a small lonely spot in this dense darkness of the universe
 In this vastness of the universe, there is no indication that someone will come from another planet to save our world from our evils

 hamen acha lage yaa na lage, par abhi ke liye keval prithvi hi vah jagah he jahaan ham rah sakate hai
 It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and a better human experience
 There is hardly any other evidence better than this picture of this small world of our vanity
 It reminds me of the responsibility to be more kind to each other, and also to save and cherish this blurred blue spot, which is our only home
 – karl segan, khagolvaigyanik Carl Segan was three times married
 In 1957, he married biologist Lynn Margulis
 The couple had two children, Jeremy and Dorian Sagan
 karl sigan or margulis ke talaak ke baad, unhone 1 9 68 main kalakaar linda salzaman se vivaah kiya or unke paas ek baccha bhi tha, nik sagan in vivaahon ke dauraan, karl saagan ne apane kariyar par bahut jor diya, ek kaarak jisane saagan ke pehle talaak main yogadan diya ho
 In 1981, Sagan married Ann Drewian and later had two children, Alexandra and Samuel Sagan
 karl sigan or drunayan 1996 main apni mrityu tak shaadi kar chuke hai
 He lived in Ithaca in an Egyptian resurrected house on the edge of a cliff that was formerly the headquarters of the Cornell Secret Society
 ishak asimov ne keval do logon main segan ko ek ke rup main bataaya, jinaki budhimata apane aap ko paar kar gai thi
 The second, he claimed, was computer scientist and artificial intelligence expert Marvin Minsky
 saagan ne dharm or vigyaan ke bich dharm or sambandh ke bare main praayah baar baar likhaa he, jo ki bhagwaan kii paaramparik avadharana ke bare main apane andeh vyakt karte hai, jo ki ek shreshth vyakti he
 for example: kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki bhagwaan ek chaunkaa safed dadhi vaala ek halkaa-chamade vaala purush he, jahaan kahin bhi ek singhaasana par akaash main baithe hue hai, har chimney ke patan ke saath milakar kaam karte hai
 Others — for example Baruch Spinoza and Albert Einstein — believe that God is basically the total amount of physical laws that describe the universe
 maanavpatiyon ke kuch chhipe hue khagoleey bindu se manushya ke bhagya ko niyantrit karne vaale manavputra kulapati ke liye koi sammohak sakshya nahin hai, lekin bhautik kanoonon ke astitv se inkaar karne main paagalpan hoga
 In another account of his idea of the concept of God, Sagan emphatically wrote: yah vichaar he ki bhagwaan ek behate hue dadhi ke saath ek vishaal safed nar he jo akaash main baithta he or har spairo ke patan ke str ko kam karata he yah ajeeb he parantu yadi ishwar ek hi bhautik kanoonon kaa matlab he jo brahmad ko niyantrit karata he, to spasht rup se aisa ek parameshwar he yah bhagwaan bhaavnaatmak rup se santoshjanak he 


 yah gurutvkarshan ke kanoon se prarthana karne ke liye zyada myne nahin rakhata he
 On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: ek naastik koi aisa vyakti he jo nishchit he ki bhagwaan astitv main nahin hai, koi vyakti jo ishwar ke astitv ke khilaaf majaburi saboot he mujhe koi aisi majaburi saboot nahin pataa he kyonki bhagwaan ko dur-samay or jagahon or antim kaarnon par le jaaya ja saktaa he, hamen is baat kii pushti karne ke liye brahmad ke bare main bahut kuch pataa hona chahie ki aisa koi bhagwaan maujuud nahin he
 Something about the existence of God and being something of the existence of God, i seem to have faith extremes in a subject with doubt and uncertainty as to actually inspire very little confidence 1996 main unke dharmik vishwaason ke bare main ek sawaal ke jawaab main, sagon ne jawaab diya, "main agyeyavaadee hum
 "sagan said that it was difficult to prove or falsify the idea of god, the creator of the universe, and that the only scientific scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinite universe
 dharm par sagon ke vichaaron ko spinoja ke devtaa main oinstin ke vishwaas ke samaan tuchh samanta ke ek rup ke rup main vyakhya kiya gaya he
 His son, Dorian Sagan, said, "my father believed that the gods of Spinoza and Einstein, God is not behind nature, but nature
" " unki antim patni, en dryuyan ne kaha: When my husband died, because he was very famous and not known for being a believer, many people would come to me — sometimes it does — and ask me if Carl finally changed and Later changed to a belief
 ve mujhe aksar poochhate hai ki kya mujhe lagata he ki main use phir se dekhuunga
 Carl mustered the courage to face his death and never sheltered in confusion
 traasadee yah thi ki ham jaanate the ki ham ek-duusare ko phir kabhi nahin dekhenge
 i never hope to be with Carl again

 a turbine is a rotating engine that rotates itself by consuming the kinetic or / and potential energy of a liquid and rotating other devices on its shaft
 pawan chakki or jal chakki aadi terbine ke praarambhik rup hai
 Turbines are of great importance in the production of electric power
 gas, bhaap or jal se jalanevaale tarabine ek duusare se bhinn hote hai
 a gas compressor or pump is also similar to a turbine but it works opposite the turbine
 tarabine main kam se kam ek roter asembli hoti he jo iskaa gatiman poorja ek yaa ek se adhik bladon ke saath shaft yaa drum ke saath is mashin ko chalaata he
 The fluid or other material exerts pressure on the blade causing the rotor or rotational to move
 yah chaal or roter ghurni ko gatij urja pradaan karti he
 Gas, steam, and water turbines typically have a cover around the blade that controls the amount of fluid
 shabd "tarabine" 1822 main french khanan ejeeniyar cloud berdin ne latin terbo shabd se gadha tha
 He mentioned it in a memoir that was presented to the Royal Science Academy Paris
 cloud berdin ke ek purv chaatr benoit forneron ne pehali vyaavhaarik jal tarabine kaa nirmaan kiya tha
 The invention of the steam turbine is attributed to the British engineer Sir Charles Parsons, for the invention of the reaction turbine, and to the Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval, for the invention of the impulse turbine
 Modern steam turbines often use reaction and impulse in a single unit
 is
 aam taur par pratikriya or aaveg kii degree isaki paridhi blade kii jad main alag-alag hoti he Now, if we talk about the working of turbine, it works on the basis of Newton's third law of motion
 yani prayek kriya par, vipareet pratikriya hoti he
 This is how the propeller of the turbine works
 propeller main laga spindal hawa yaa pani par dabaav banaata he
 This pressure causes the propeller to push the turbine backwards, causing it to move
 aamtaur par tarabine ko ek jagah rakh diya jaataa he, taaki jab bhi pani usase hokar gujarey to tarabine ke har blade par padane vaale dabaav se vah chal pade
 hawa yaa pani ke tarabine ke saath ek hi niyam lagu hota he
 The higher the water or air flow, the faster the turbine will run
 kaaryakari drav main dabaav urja or gatij urja shaamil hai
 Fluid can be compressed or uncompressed
 kai bhautik siddhanton ke aropan dwaara terbinon ko is urja ko ikattha karne ke liye niojit kiya jaataa he
 In impulse turbines the flow of high velocity liquid or gas jets is used to change the direction of the rotor blades
 parinamswaroop aaveg tarabine gumti he or gas yaa drav dhimi gati se baahar nikal jaataa he
 Various definitions of this term are given
 vistrut paribhaasha ke anusaar gas tarabine vah mul chaalak he jiske sampurna ushmiya chakra main kaaryakari taral gasiy avasthaa main hi bana rahata he evam jiske sabhi yantrangon kii gati paribhrami hoti he
 According to the narrow definition, the term is used only for the main turbine organ whose medium is hot air
 kuch vidwaanon ke matanusaar gas tarabine vah yantra he jisamen pravaah prakram avirat rahata he evam shakti tarabine dwaara praapt hoti he
 Those are the basic driving devices that convert the potential energy contained in water into mechanical work

 Due to this, electricity started to be received at a very cheap price even in remote waterless villages and the development of various types of industrial businesses was encouraged
 bhaap tarabine ek mulchaalak he, jisamen bhaap kii ushma-urja ko gatij urja main parivartit kar, ucch gatisheel bhaap ko ek ghurnak par bandhe hue bahut se falkon par takaraayaa jaataa he, jisase falak paribhraman karte hai evam isse kaary hota he
 In a reciprocating steam engine, the piston is acted upon by the static pressure of the steam
 yadhyapi ingine main bhaap piston ke saath chalati he, phir bhi ingine kii kriya main bhaap kii gatij urja kaa prabhaav naganay he
 Steam turbines can have higher speeds than steam engines and the speed can be larger
 tarabine ke purjon kaa santulan acha rahata he
 The same amount of steam and the same state of steam turbine can produce more power than a steam engine
 bhaap ingine se kuch varsh kaam lene ke baad bhaap kii khapat bad jaati he, parantu tarabine main aisi avasthaa nahin aati prithvi par ke sabhi mul chaalkon main bhaap tarabine sabase adhik tikaoo hota he
 The biggest advantage of a turbine is that it provides the rotor speed directly, while the steam engine has to handle separate materials to achieve rotational speed
 vaashpitra main bhaap kaa janan ucch daab evam adhitaap par hota he
 When this steam approaches the turbine, it has a high amount of heat energy and its pressure is so high that it can circulate to low pressure
 parantu us samay isaki gatij urja naganya hoti he
 Therefore, before steam can do some work, its heat energy is converted into kinetic energy
 yah parivartan, acchhee tarah abhikalpit upkaran main, bhaap ko vistaarit karne se hota he
 The diffusion of steam is accomplished either in a single action, or in different actions
 iskaa arth yah hota he ki ushma urja ko gatij urja main parivartit karne ke liye bahut se sthir upkaran vyavhaar main laae jate hai or praaia: do sthir upkarnon ke bich ek gatiman upkaran laga rahata he
 The kinetic energy received in the stationary device is then applied to work on the bonded moving device
