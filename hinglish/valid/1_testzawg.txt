 The naturalist George Harris wrote the first published description of the Tasmanian devil in 1807 and named it Didelphis ursina, which literally means "meat-eating bear" because of its round-eared bear-like characteristics
 He previously made a presentation on the subject at the London Zoological Society

 The typical ancestry of the Tasmanian devil is thought to have emerged in principle in the Middle Ages — according to molecular evidence that the Quoll ancestors split between one and a half million years ago — when Australia experienced severe climate changes, a hot and humid climate, a waterless, In the dry ice age, metamorphism occurred, resulting in mass extinction

 Studies have suggested that food security is less important than den protection, because the greater dominance of habitat destruction is the protection of mortality at lower mortality rates, as is the effect of habitat destruction that has more of the latter
 The small puppies live with their mothers in their den and other devils move, changing the den every 1-3 days and traveling an average of 8
6 km each night

 When the temperature was raised to 40 and the humidity was kept at 50%, the devil's body temperature rose two degrees within 60 minutes, but then gradually decreased to two hours later, reaching the initial level and for two hours
 Maintained it
 During this time the devil drank water and showed no signs of discomfort, leading scientists to believe that sweat and evaporative cooling are the primary means of heat dissipation

 a minor drawback is that the high flow system that relies on the flow rate to protect the lubricant from thermal stress is susceptible to catastrophic failure upon sudden system shutdown
 ek automotive oil-kuld terbo charger ek theth udhaaharan he
 Turbochargers become hot red during operation and the oil that cools them remains because their time in the system is very short ie high flow rate
 If the system is stopped abruptly, the oil in the turbo charger is immediately oxidized and will block the oil passages including deposits
 These deposits can completely block the oil passages, reducing cooling over time, resulting in a complete shutdown of the turbo charger, usually with jam bearings

 vidyut dhara ke prabhaav se jis lohe main chumbakatv utpann hota he, use vidyut chumbak kehete hai
 For this, by wrapping the wire on the iron, the iron can be magnetized by flowing the current through that wire
 san 1820 i

 unhone jo pehla chumbak banaaya yah 350 kilo kaa bhaar uthaa saktaa tha or iske baad unhone jo doosraa vidyut chumbak banaaya, vah 1,000 kilogram kaa bhaar uthaa saktaa tha
 Their electric magnets received the above strong magnetism from the current of several cell batteries
 iske baad to isse bhi shaktishaalee vidyut chumbakon kaa uttarottar nirmaan hota gaya
 In 1891, du Boye built a large electric magnet
 is vidyut chumbak ke crode par taar ke 2,400 phere lapete gaye or jab taar se 50 ampiore kii vidyut dhara pravaahit kii gai, to is vidyut chumbak ke bich 40 hajaar gouse kaa prabal chumbakeey kshetra utpann hua
 The poles of this electric magnet were cone shaped and facing each other
 dhruvon ke bich kii khaali jagah kii lambaai 1 mimi or vyas 6 mimi tha
 The largest magnet that Du Bias made was weighing 27 hundredweight and produced a magnetic field of 65 thousand gauss in a space of 3 mm long and 0
5 mm in diameter between its poles
 pi
 vaais ne bhi ati balashaali vidyut chumbakon kaa nirmaan kiya
 An electric magnet made by him had 1,440 rounds of copper nozzles and a current of 100 amperes was shed from it
 nalika ke andar se pani bahaakar use thandha rakhaa jaataa tha
 Doo Boy's electromagnet also had wires wrapped in a hollow tube and kept cool by pouring water inside the tube
 vidyut chumbak ke crode ke liye aise lohe kaa vyavhaar hota he jisaki chumbakeey pravriti unchi ho, chumbakan dhara band kar dene par crode kaa avshesh chumbakatv nimnatam ho or vah sheeghra hi chumbakeey santrutti na praapt kare
 Pitted iron, or molded soft steel, is used for the electrode's core
 kintu kisi bhi prakaar ke lohe kaa vyavhaar kiya jaae, uskaa chumbakatv ek nishchit seemaa ko nahin paar kar saktaa, chaahe chumbakan dhara ko kitna bhi kyon na badhaayaa jaae
 Therefore, Kapitza treated the wire as a solenoid, the core being air, to generate a very strong magnetic field
