 or yah jaankaree, koshikaon ke kendra main maujuud jis tatv main rahati he use diaine kehete hai
 When there is a permanent change in the DNA of a gene, it is called mutation
 yah koshikaon ke vibhaajan ke samay kisi dosha ke kaaran paidaa ho saktaa he yaa phir parabangnee vikiran kii vajah se yaa rasinic tatv yaa virus se bhi ho saktaa he
 Changes in nature may or may not result in molecular DNA mutations that result in changes in the presence or function of an outgoing organism

 jantujgat kii vividhta par ham drushtipaat karen to paayenge ki, udhaaharan ke liye, billi jati ke jantuon main hi kitna bhed he : billi, sher, chita, singh, sabhi isi varg ke jantu hai
 Similarly, many breeds are seen in dogs native, hunter, bulldog, shaggy, etc
 is vividhta ke mul kaaran kaa gyaan sabhi ko nahin hota or sabase badi baat to yah he ki kautuhalvash bhi koi is bhed ko jaananaa nahi chahta
 This diversity seems so simple and common to us that our attention never goes to it
 kintu, yadi ham is vaividhya ke kaaran kii mimasaa karen to sachmuch hamen chakit ho janaa padegaa
 The root cause of this variation is mutation
 utparivartan kii paribhaasha anek prakaar se di gai he, kintu sabhi kaa nishkarsh yahi he ki yah ek prakaar kaa anuvanshik parivartan he
 Students of cytology know that chromosomes are found in a fixed number in the nucleus of cells

 But the mistake comes from everyone - nature is not untouched by this
 pratilipikaran ke samay, kabhi kabhi, newcliotidon ke sangyojan main dosha utpann ho jaataa he
 This defect occurs accidentally; It has been given the noun of mutation
 goldsmit ne utparivartan kii paribhaasha dete hue batalaaya he ki utparivartan vah saadhan he, jiske dwaara nae anuvanshik tip utpann hote hai
 According to Drjansky and his colleagues, mutation is a misguided point originating new varieties or breeds
 udvikas ke anek pramaanon main utparivartan ko bhi ek pramaan mana jaataa he
 In this connection, the name of the Dutch botanist, Hygo Devijr, is taken respectfully
 inhone inothera lamakiena naamak ek paudhe par kai prakaar ke prayog kiye the
 Every year there were several types of species in this plant, which they classified into five groups and based on the results of their experiments, made the following conclusions- 1
 naveen spishiz kii utpatti kramik na hokar taatkaalik ek-ba-ek hoti he; 2
 Initially, these species are stable like their parents
 3
 ek hi samay main saamaanya taur par ek saath ek jaise bahut se spishiz utpann hote hai
 4
 Mutations have no definite direction, they can develop in any form
 5
 utparivartan bich bich main kai baar ho saktaa he
 Similar experiments were conducted by two American biologists named Beedil and Tatum on a mold called Neurospora
 unhone is rog ke bijaanu ko eks athwa ultrawilet kirnon dwaara abhikarmit karke unke badhane kii gati kii jaanch kii
 They found that in the culture medium such spores were not able to grow, so they added some aminoacids
 iske falswaroop ve hi paudhe pun: vruddhi ko praapt hone lage
 Therefore, he was of the opinion that due to radiation, the normal production capacity of spores is affected and this defect is still present in the next generations
 isi prakaar ke aakasmik anuvanshik parivartanon ko utparivartan kaha jaataa he
 All kinds, shapes, chemical structures, diseases, etc
 properties of living beings can be mutated
 isi aadhaar par utparivartanon kii kai kotiyaan bana lee gai hai, jaise jin utparivartan, gunasutra utparivartan aadi
 Mutation is called instantaneous or accidental genetic mutation
 yah parivartan doshayukt hi ho, yah koi aavashyak nahin he
 Not all mutations are contaminated or harmful
 inase laabh bhi hota he or is prakritik dosha kaa laabh uthaaya bhi jaataa rahaa he
 We will revisit this in-place
 utparivartan kii ghatnaayen viral athwa yada-kada hoti hai
 Studies have been made by studies of the clan fly called Drosophila that this type of mutation is reflected in a very negligible form in any one of several million normal species
 aaltenvarg ne res ke ghodon kii aadhunik teevr gati kaa kaaran kramik aropit utparivartan batalaaya he
 This or such change can always be said to be beneficial
 bahut se udaahranon main, is utparivartan ke kaaran ghodon kii gati main nunata bhi aa sakati he
 Hence the conclusion is that mutation is "arbitrary change"
 yahan darwin kaa "prakritik varan kaa siddhant" athwa "yogyatam kaa jivan" lagu hota he, jiske anusaar is aakasmik parivartan ko sah sakanevaale jeev jivit rah pate hai, anyathaa nirbalon kii mrityu ho jaati he
 This mutation is attributed to the results of the experiments that Mandel conducted on pea beans
 utparivartan kab hoga, yah koi nishchit rup se nahin kah saktaa
 Mutation may occur at any stage or stage of growth after cytosis
 yadi utparivartan kisi ek hi bijaanu yaa yugmak main hota he to bhavi santati main se keval ek main yah parilakshith hoga
 Half of the mutated generations will have the symptoms of mutation present and the remaining half will be unaffected by them
 utparivartan ke lakshanon se yukt santatiyon kii bhavi pidiyon main bhi ve hi lakshan dikhalaai dete rahenge
 It is a difficult task to identify a mutation in cells
 kai baar to aisa bhi hota he ki vah sarvatha adrishy ho jaataa he or usapar kisi bhi drushti bhi nahin ja paati
 But mutations in germ cells are important demographically
 utparivartan kyon hote hai, iskaa santoshjanak utar jeev vaigyanikon ke paas uplabdh nahin he
 Yes, these people have devised some methods by which mutations can be done in an artificial or superimposed manner
 aropit utparivartan sarvada bahari kaarnon se hi ho saktaa he, jinhen ham neeche di gai kotiyon main vargeekrut kar sakate hai:-- 1
 If the temperature is increased up to the endpoint in temperature-generating cells, the speed of mutation will increase
 2
 rasayan-sarson ke tel kaa dhuaan, farmaldihide peroysaide, nitras amla aadi kaa prayog karne par utparivartan dar main vruddhi ho sakati he
 3
 The use of radiation-excitation, gamma, beta, ultraviolet rays etc
 also increases the mutation rate
 swargeey professor ech
je
mular ne is kaarak par anek adbhut anusandhan kiye hai
 4
 Mutation rate can be increased by an extraordinary change in the atmosphere
 jin-vinimay ke samay kuch durghatnaayen ho sakati hai
 We can divide these accidents into three groups: - inamen se pratham do prakaar ke parivartan gambhir maane gaye hai, jinase koshika kii mrityu tak ho sakati he
 The third type of change is not so serious
 anuvanshiki vaigyanikon ne utparivartan ke nimnlikhit bhed batalaaye hai:-- 1
 gene or point mutation 2
 aropit utparivartan a mutation is defined as saying that mutation is the name of a last- minute chemical change in the genetic material of a species 
 ye parivartan gunasutron kii sanrachana tathaa sankhya main utpann hote hai
 Therefore, the change in molecular structure of a gene from this point of view is called "gene mutation"
 kintu, jab is prakaar ke parivartan gunasutra ke kisi binduvishesh yaa khandwishesh main dikhalaai denge to unhen "bindu utparivartan" kahenge
 In fact, there is no special distinction between these two types of changes, so these two terms are mentioned in synonymous forms
 utparivartan taatkaalik hote hai, at: inhen "taatkaalik utparivartan" bhi kehete hai
 The point mutations are very subtle and do not affect the entire organism
 at: utparivartan shabd kaa prayog saadharantaya bindu utparivartan ke liye hi kiya jaataa he
 When there is a gene mutation in the reproductive cell of a human, it is transferred to its zygote and thus reaches a new generation produced by these cobies
 asankhya baar koshika-vibhaajanon ke falswaroop utparivartan jin bhi apni pratilipiyaan utpann karte karte kisi lakshan yaa gun vishesh ke liye prabhavi ban jaataa he
 Effective mutations can be readily detected in chromosomes or genes located in their carrier cells
 kintu aise utparivartan supt utparivartanon kii tulana main kam hi drushtigochar hote hai
 But as far as mutations in humans are concerned, such mutations have been shown to be mostly effective
 lingasahalagn utparivartan vishamayugmi naron main hi adhiktar dikhalai dete hai kyonki inamen lingasahalagn prabhavi jin paae jate hai
 Therefore, latent mutations of male parents are visible only in the second generation male offspring
 manushya ke adhikansh lingasahalagn utparivartan prasupt maane gaye hai
 In bisexual plants are often visible
 aprabhavi utparivartan yadi janankoshikaon main utpann hote hai to bhavi santatiyaan avashya hi vishamyugmaji hongi
 Once ineffective ineffective mutations occur, they are not visible for many generations
 kintu yahi utparivartan yadi lingasahalagn hote hai, to agali peedi main hi prabhavi ho jate hai
 Mortal mutations are considered mostly ineffective or dormant
 pranaghatak utparivartan yadi janankoshika main hi jate hai, to bhavi santati vishamayugmi hogi
 If such mutations occur in egg laying animals, then about 1 in heterozygous parents
 4 andon se bachche hi nahin utpann honge
 About the same number of offspring will die at birth or soon after taking birth, under various conditions of illusory growth
 ghaatak utparivartanee alingsutron main aam taur par dikhalaai dete hai or ye kisi ye gunasutra main ho sakate hai
 If there are lethal genes in the chromosomes of the henchman hen, then the skeleton of such an offspring would be ugly or zigzag and she would have died before birth
 kintu vishamayugmi bhrunon se bachche utpann hote hai or jivit bhi rahete hai, bhale hi unke asthipanjar tede medhe hon
 The creeper fowl of such children is called, because the legs and the waist of these chickens are bitten
 viral udaahranon main pratilomit utparivartan bhi ho jate hai
 Sometimes the mutated gene remains present for several generations and is spread among thousands of members of the same clan
 kintu, jab sahasaa kisi sadsy kii janankoshika main koi jin saamaanya aprabhavi yugmavikalpi ko utparivartit kar detaa he to aisi sthiti main ek or utparivartan ho jaataa he
 This type of regeneration has been termed the inverse mutation
 isse yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki utparivartan kii rogi dasha pun: saamaanya kii ore parivartit ho sakati he
 There are also some mutated conditions in bacteria in which they lose the ability to make vitamins
 kintu kuch kaal baad ve pun: vitamin utpann karne lagate hai
 Their return to normal state is called retardant mutation
 kayik utparivartan saadharantaya sharir ke utakon main hi drushtigochar hote hai
 Somatic mutations do not have long-term effects

 Scientists have found through experiments that there are three types of ambient effects on mutations, by temperature, by certain chemicals and by irradiation
 tapakram- utparivartan par tapakram kaa kya prabhaav padataa he, isapar adhiktar prayog kadli makkhi, drosophila, ko hi lekar kiye gaye hai
 In a similar experiment, when the sex-linked ineffective lethal genes were studied, it was found that 14 ° Cg
 But 0
087 percent, 22 degree centigrade
 But 0
188 percent and 28 degree centigrade
 But 0
325 percent of lethal genes were generated
 isse ek baat yah spasht hoti he ki tapakram main yadi 10 degree kii bhi vruddhi ho jaati he to utparivartan kii dar main dooni athwa tiguni vruddhi ho jaati he
 In this context, it is also interesting to note that mutation can be effected not only by an increase in temperature, but also by extreme depletion
 drosophila milenogaster ke teen dinon ke dimbhon ko -6 degree taap par rakhane par dekha gaya ki 25 se 40 minute ke bheetar inke eks tathaa dwitiya gunasutron main ghaatak utparivartan kii dar tinguni ho gai
 Astu, it is strange that extreme increase in cold and heat has almost the same effect
 aisa kyon hota he, is par abhi adhik prakaash nahin padaa he
 The fruits of chemical effects on mutation have been studied in many ways
 rasinic abhikarmo dwaara utparivartan dar main vruddhi kaa prayaas anek vidhiyon dwaara kiya gaya he
 In this context, recent experiments by Overbash and Rabson have shown that mustard smoke is a highly effective mutant medium
 vayask drosophila main uchit maatra main die gaye dhuen ke prabhaav ko dekhne par gyaat hua ki isse utparivartan dar main 10 pratishat se bhi adhik kii vruddhi ho jaati he
 In addition to mustard smoke, several paraxides, paralene, permengate, urethane, caffeine, etc
 have also been proven to increase the mutation rate
 sarson tathaa parakidon ke atirikt duusare rasayanon ke prabhaav apekshaakrit kam hi dekhe gaye
 The second deficiency was also found in them that their effect is visible only at particular stages of formulation or in particular directions of change
 isi prakaar kuch rasayan keval nar ko har prabhavit kar pate hai, maadaa ko nahin
 The reason for this has been stated that until a chemical penetrates inside the nucleus of the cell, its effect will be doubtful; Secondly, if the cytoplasm of the external chemical is neutralized, then it will not have any effect

 The effect of X-rays is so much that they dissolve the chromosomes, which make the effects of the way visible
 inke atanrgat sthanantaran pratilomon, delishan dvigunan aadi samavisht hai
 To be honest, irradiation, no matter what type it is, mutates only when it has the ability to produce ions

 The importance of mutations can have the following aspects: udvikasiya mahatv - aarambh main hi hamane dekha he ki sristi ke jeevajgat main vividhta drushtigochar hoti he
 The evolutionary theory holds that all of this visible molecule is made great
 arthath prayek mahaan kii ikai koi na koi anu he
 The same molecule takes on a form of one to two, two to four, eight, sixteen and infinite and passes through a period of unspeakable and unimaginable multiplications

 computer virus yaa computer vishaanu ek computer program he jo apni anulipi kar saktaa he or upyogkarta kii anumati ke bina ek computer ko sankramit kar saktaa he or upyogkarta ko iskaa pataa bhi nahin chalata he
 The term "virus" is also commonly used in reference to various types of malware and adware programs, although it is sometimes mistaken
 mul virus anulipiyon main parivartan kar saktaa he, yaa anulipiyaan khud apane aap main parivartan kar sakati hai, jaisaa ki ek roopantarit virus main hota he
 a virus can spread from one computer to another only when its host is brought to an uninfected computer, for example by a user sending it to a network or the Internet, or by removing it from a removable medium such as a floppy disk, CD , Or by bringing on a USB drive
 Simultaneously, the virus can spread to other computers through infected files on a file system or network system that can be opened on other computers
 Sometimes the word virus was used for computer worm and Trojan hoses
 goes
 ek keeda anya computaron main khud failaa saktaa he ise poshi ke ek bhagya ke rup main sthanantarit hone kii zarurat nahin hoti he or ek trogen horse ek aisi fil he jo hanirahit prathit hoti he
 Worms and Trojan horses can damage a computer system's data, functional performance, or networking during performance
 saamaanya taur par, ek keedaa vastav main system ke hardware yaa software ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaata, jabaki kam se kam siddhant rup main, ek trogen pelod, nishpaadan ke dor kisi bhi prakaar kaa nuksaan pahunchne main sakasham hota he
 When the program is not running, nothing appears but the Trojan horse enters as soon as the infected code runs
 yahi kaaran he ki logon ke liye virus or anya mailaware ko khojna bahut hi kathin hota he or isiilie unhen spyware program or panjikaran prakriya kaa upyog karnaa padataa he
 Nowadays, most personal computers are connected to the Internet and the locker area network and the local area network facilitates the process of spreading corrupted code
 aaj kaa virus network sevaao kaa bhi laabh uthaa saktaa he jaise world wide web, i mail, twarit sandesh or sanchika saajha pranaliyaan virason or keedon ko failane main madad karti hai
 In addition, some sources use an alternative terminology, in which a virus is a form of self-duplicating malware
 kuch melware, vinaashkari prograamon, sanchikaon ko delit karne, yaa hard discs kii punah formating karne ke dwaara computer ko kshati pahuchane ke liye program kiye jate hai
 Other malware programs are not built for any damage, but simply duplicate themselves and perhaps make their presence known by a text, video, or audio message
 yahan tak kii ye kam ashubh mailaware program bhi computer upyogkarta ke liye samasyaayen utpann kar sakate hai
 
they usually take control of the computer memory used by legitimate programs
 iske parinamswaroop, ve aksar aniyamit vyavhaar kaa kaaran hote hai or system ko nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 Additionally, many malware are prone to bugs, and these bugs can damage the system or cause data loss
 kai siaidi program aise program hai jo upyogkarta dwaara downlod kiye gaye hai or har baar pop ap kiye jate hai
 As a result, the speed of the computer is greatly reduced but it is very difficult to find and stop the problem

 They created this alleged virus to prevent theft of copies of the software they had created
 However, analysts claimed that the Ashar virus, a species of the brain, probably pre-dated it based on the code inside the virus
 isse pehle kii computer network vyapak hote adhikansh virus hathaaye jane yogya madhyam, vishesh rup se flopy discs par fail gaye
 In the early days, regular exchange of information and programs was done by floppies among many users of personal computers

us samay ke pi si pehle flopi se boot karne kaa prayaas karte the, yadi koi flopi drive main rah gai he
 This was the most successful transition strategy until the use of floppies was reduced, making it easier to create viruses in the wild boot sector

 apane aap kii anulipi karne ke liye, ek virus ko code kaa nishpaadan karne kii tathaa smriti par likhane kii anumati honi chahie is kaaran se, kai virus apane aap ko nishpaadan yogya filon se sanlagn kar lete hai jo uchit program kaa hissaa ho saktaa he
 If a user tries to start an infected program, then it is possible that the code of the virus is executed first
 Viruses can be divided into two types, based on their behavior and their performance
 Resident viruses quickly find other cells that can be infected, infect these targets, and eventually control application programs
 But transfer what they have infected
 nivasee virus poshi kii talash nahin karte hai jab ve shuru hote hai
 Instead, a resident virus loads itself into memory upon execution and transfers control to the host program
 virus prishth bhoomi main sakriy rahata he or nae poshiyon ko sankramit karata he jab in filon ko anya prograamon yaa khud oparating system ke dwaara acces kiya jaataa he
 It is believed that the non-resident virus consists of a finder module and a replication module
 khojak modul sankraman hetu nai filein khojane ke liye uttaradaayi hota he
 For each new executable file, the finder module attacks, calling the duplication module to infect the file
 nivasee virus main ek anulipi modul hota he jo ek anivaasee virus ke dwaara niojit anulipi modul ke samaan hota he
 Although this module is not called by the finder module
 iske bajaay, virus anulipi modul ko smriti main lod karata he jab iskaa nishpaadan hota he or yah sunishchit kar letaa he ki har baar jab oparating system ek nishchit aaparishan kaa pradarshan karata he to is modul kaa nishpaadan hota he
 For example, each time the operating system executes a file, duplicate modules can be called
 is maamle main, virus computer par nishpadit hone vaale prayek upyukt program ko sankramit kar detaa he
 Occasionally, resident viruses are further subdivided into two categories, one acute infectious and the other slow infective
 The fast infectious is designed to infect as many files as possible
 For example, an acute infectious access infects every possible host file
 yah ek virus rodhi soft ware ke liye ek vishesh samasya he, chunki ek virus scanner har sambhav poshi sanchika ko akses kar legaa jab yah system kaa vyapak scan karata he
 If the virus scanner fails to notice that such a virus is present in memory, the virus attacks the scanner from behind and thus infects all the files being scanned
 teevr sankramak apane prasar ke liye teevr sankraman dar par bharosa karte hai
 The disadvantage of this method is that infecting multiple files makes it more likely to be detected, as the virus slows down the computer or performs many suspicious actions that can be detected by anti-virus software
 duusari or dhime sankramak, is prakaar se banaaye jate hai ki ve poshi ko an-aavruth rup se sankramit karte hai
 For example, some slow infects infect files only when they are being copied
 dhime sankramak ki simit kriya ki vajah se unka pataa lagaana aasaan nahin hota he: ve computer ko bahut adhik dhimaa nahin karte hai, par baar-baar virus virdohi soft ware ko jhatka dete hai jise prograamon ke sandigdh vyavhaar ke dwaara pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 Slow infectives don't seem very successful, virason ne bhinn prakaar ke prasar madhyamon yaa poshiyon ko lakshya banaaya he
 This list cannot end: pdfs, jaise HTML, durbhaavnapurna code se sambandhit ho saktaa he
 What some virus writers have written has no significance
 EXE vistaar ke ant parofngh, ummid he ki upyogkarta vishwast fil ke prakaar par ruk jayega, vah is baat par dhyaan nahin degaa kii computer antim prakaar kii sanchika ke saath prarambh hoga
 trogen harse ) dekhen To avoid detection by the user, some viruses perform various types of deception
 kuch puraane virus, vishesh rup se MS - DOS manch par, yah sunishchit kar lete hai ki jab sanchika ko virus ke dwaara sankramit kiya jaataa he to poshi sanchika ke " antim baar sanshodhit " hone kii dinaank bani rahati he
 Although this approach does not fool anti-virus software, especially those that maintain dates for cyclic redundancy checks on file changes
 kuch virus apane aakaar ko badhaaye bina or sanchikaon ko kshati pahuchaye bina sanchikaon ko sankramit kar sakate hai
 They do this by overwriting unused fields of executable files
 ye cavity virus kehalaata he
 For example, the CIH virus, or the Chernobyl virus, infects portable executable files
 kyonki un sanchikaon main kai khaali sthaan the, virus jo 1 KB lambaai kaa tha, sanchika ke aakar main nahin judaa
kuch virus virus virdohi software ke kaary ko khatm karke apane aap ko prakat nahin hone dete hai, isse pehle ki vah uskaa pataa laga le
kyonki computer or oparating system adhik viksit or jatil ho rahe hai, chupaane ki puraani takneekon ko navinikrut karne yaa pratisthapit karne ki aavashyaktaa he
 To protect a computer from viruses, the demand may be that the file system migrates to the detailed and explicit permission for all types of file access
 ek virus ke liye aage failane ke liye poshiyon ko sankramit karne ki zarurat hoti he
 In some cases, infecting a host may be a bad idea
 For example, many anti-virus programs check the integrity of their code
 isliye aise prograamon kaa sankraman is sambhaavna ko badhayega ki is virus kaa pataa chal gaya he
 For this reason, some viruses do not infect programs that are part of anti-virus software
 ek anya prakaar kaa poshi jisase virus kabhi kabhi bachane ki koshish karata he vah he bat sanchikaaye
bat sanchikaaye ve sanchikaaye hai jo ki vishesh rup se virus virdohi software yaa khud virus virdohi peshewaron ke dwaara ek virus ke dwaara sankramit hone ke liye banaai gai hai
 These files can be created for different reasons, all of them are related to virus detection
 chunki bat sanchikaon kaa upyog virus kaa pataa lagane main yaa jaanch ko sambhav banane main kiya jaataa he, virus ke dwaara sankraman nahin hone kaa laabh uthaaya ja saktaa he
 Viruses typically do this by avoiding virus programs, such as small program files or programs that have specific patterns of 'garbage instructions'
 a related strategy to make batting difficult is sparse infection
 Sometimes, sparse Infectious do not infect a host file which may be a suitable candidate for infection in other conditions
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek virus yadrichhik aadhaar par tay kar saktaa he ki ek sanchika ko sankramit karnaa he yaa nahin, yaa ek virus saptaah ke vishesh dinon main hi poshi sanchikaon ko sankramit kar saktaa he
 Some viruses try to trick anti-virus software by requesting the operating system
 virus virdohi software sanchika ko padhne kaa anurodh karata he or yah anurodh OS ke bajaay virus ko jaataa he, is prakaar se ek virus apane aap ko chupa letaa he
 The anti-virus software now rolls over the uninfected version of the file, making it appear that the file is "clean"
 aadhunik virus virdohi software ke paas virus kii chori kaa pataa lagane ke liye kai takneekein hai
 The only reliable method of preventing theft is to boot through a medium that is clean
 adhikansh virus virdohi program saadhaaran prograamon ke bheetar virus praturup khojane ki koshish karte hai ise tathakthith virus ke hastakshar kaha jaataa he
 a signature is a figurative byte pattern, which is a part of a particular virus or virus family
 yadi ek virus scanner ek sanchika main aisa praturup khoj letaa he, yah upyogkarta ko suchit kar detaa he ki sanchika sankramit he
 Users can then delete this file, or "clean" or "fix" the infected file
 kuch virus aisi takneekon kaa upyog karte hai ki jo hastakshar ke dwaara iskaa pataa lagane ko mushkil hi nahin balki asambhav bana detaa he
 These viruses change their code on each infection
 arthath prayek sankramit sanchika main virus kii ek alag prajati hoti he
 a more advanced method for encrypting viruses is the use of simple encryption
 In this case, the virus consists of a small decrypting module and an encrypted copy of the virus's code
 yadi prayek sankramit sanchika ke liye virus ek alag kunjee se ancrypted he, to virus kaa keval ek bhaag sthir bana rahata he vah he decrypting modul, jo ke ant se sanlagn hoga
is maamle main, ek virus scinar hastakshar kaa upyog karke sidhe virus kaa pataa nahin laga saktaa, lekin yah fir bhi dicripting modul kaa pataa laga saktaa he, jo sambhav virus kii abhi bhi apratyaksh jaanch kar saktaa he
 Since these will be keys stored on the infected host, it is actually possible to decode the last virus, but this is probably not necessary, since the self-modified code is so rare that it causes the virus scanner to at least record the suspicious file
 Can
 ek puraane lekin compact, ancripshan main ek sthir virus ki prayek bit xoring shaamil he, taaki oparation kaa dohraan keval dicripshan ke liye ho
yah sandigdh code he jo apane aap ko sanshodhit karata he, isliye kai virus paribhaashaon main ancripshan / dicripshan hastakshar kaa ek bhaag ho saktaa he
 Polymorphic code was the first technology that posed a serious threat to the virus screener
 Like regular encrypted viruses, a polymorphic virus infects files with its encrypted code, which is decoded by a decryption module
 bahurupi virus ke maamle main, yah dicripshan modul bhi prayek sankraman par sanshodhit hota he
 Therefore properly written polymorphic viruses have no parts that are similar in infections, making it difficult to detect using signatures
 virus virdohi software ek pratidwandvi kaa upyog karke decrypting ke dwaara iskaa pataa laga saktaa he, yaa ancrypted virus sharir ke sankhyikeey praturup vishleshan ke dwaara iskaa pataa laga saktaa he
 To enable polymorphic code, a virus must have a polymorphic engine somewhere in its encrypted body
 See polymorphic code for technical detail on how such engines work
 Some viruses require polymorphic code to work in this way In that it mainly binds the rate of mutation of the virus
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek virus keval kuch hi samay main utparivartit hone ke liye program kiya jaataa he, yaa ise is prakaar se program kiya ja saktaa he ki jab ye computer par aisi sanchika ko sankramit kar rahaa ho jisamen pehle se virus kii anulipiyaan ho, to yah utparivartan se batch sake
 jise dhime bahurupi code kaa upyog karne kaa laabh yah he ki isse virus virdohi peshewar ke liye virus kaa pratinidhi kaa namoona praapt karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he, kyonki bat sanchikaaye jo ek baar chalane main sankramit ho jaati hai, unamem praroopik rup se virus kaa samaan namoona hoga
 ise yah sambhaavna bad jaayegi ki virus scanner ke dwaara ki gai jaanch avishwasaneey hogi or yah ho saktaa he ki virus ke kuch udhaaharan jaanch kaa pataa lagane main sakasham na hon
 Some viruses rewrite themselves each time they infect a new executable to avoid detection by simulation
 virus jo aisi takanic kaa upyog karte hai ve roopantarit kehalaate hai
 a modified engine is required to make the conversion possible
 ek roopantarit virus aamtaur par bahut bada or jatil hota he
 For example, the W32 / Simile contains more than 14000 characters of group language code, 90% of which is part of the converted engine
 jaise ek aabaadi main anuvanshik vividhta ke kam hone par usamen ek maatr rog kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he, samaan rup se ek network par software system ki vividhta kii bhi virus kii vinaashkari kshamta ko simit karti he
 This became a topic of special consideration in 1990 when Microsoft gained market dominance in desktop operating systems and office suites
 microsoft software ke upyogkarta or internet explorer ) vishesh rup se virus ke prasar ke liye kamjor hai
 The reason why Microsoft software is targeted by viruses is their desktop dominance and is often criticized for many mistakes and holes for virus writers
 samanvit or gaiyr ekikrut microsoft anuprayog or sanchika pranali ke acces ke saath bhashaaon ki patakathaon ke anuprayog, or netwarking lakshanon ke saath anuprayog) bhi vishesh rup se jokhim yukt hai
 Although Windows is the most popular operating system for virus writers, some viruses also exist on other platforms
 koi bhi oparating system jo chalane ke liye tisare paksh ke program ko anumati de saktaa he vah saidhantik rup se virus ko chalaa saktaa he
 Some operating systems are less secure than others
 Unix-based oss only allow their users to execute within a secure space under their own instructions
 internet aadhaarit ek shodh se pataa chalaa ki aise maamle bhi the jab logon ne jaan-boojh kar ek virus ko dianlod karne ke liye ek vishesh batan ko dabaaya
ek suraksha form f-secure ne ek 6 maah kaa abhiyaan google aidwards par chalaaya jisane kaha "kya aapkaa pi si virus mukt he?yah yahan sankramit praapt karen ! " 
iskaa parinaam tha 409 clic
2006 main apekshaakrit kuch suraksha ke tareeke thejo mike OS x ko lakshya bana rahe the ke saath) 
puraane appal oparating system ke liye virus ki ek sankhya jo mike oes clasik ke naam se jaani jaati he, wo alag alag sroton main bahut alag hoti he, appal ke saath kaha jaataa he ki keval chaar prakaar ke jane maane virus hote hai or swatantra sutron ke anusaar 63 virus ke rup hai
 It is safe to say that Macs are less likely to be targeted because of lower market share, and thus a Mac-specific virus can only infect a small proportion of computers
 
mex or windos ke bich virus kaa jokhim mukhya bikri bindu he, ek yah ki Apple unke ek mike praapt karen vigyaapan main kaam letaa he
 According to this, Mex also has security issues similar to Microsoft Windows, although no one in the wild has successfully taken full advantage of it
 windos or unics main samaan patakatha kii kshamta he, lekin jab unics swaabhaavik rup se saamaanya upyogkartaaon ko oparating system vaataavaran ke liye parivartan karne ke liye acces karne se roktaa he, vindos kii purani pratiyaan jaise vindos 95 or 98 aisa nahin karti
1997 main, jab ek "bliss " naamak virus Linux ke liye jari kiya gaya tha --pramukh virus virdohi vikritaon ne ek chetavanee jari kii unics kii tarah ke system thik vidos kii tarah virus kaa shikaar ban sakate hai
 Bliss virus can be considered symbolic of viruses - unlike on Unix systems -
 Bliss requires that the user run it explicitly and that it can only infect programs that are modified by the user
 Can
 vindos upyogkarta ke vipareet, adhikansh unics upyogkarta kisi software ko instul karne ke alaava kisi vyavasthaapak upyogkarta ke rup main log in nahin karte: yahan tak ki yadi ek upyogkarta virus ko chalaata he to bhi yah oparating system ko nuksaan nahin kar saktaa he
 The Bliss virus never became widespread and remained primarily a subject of research interest
 Its creator later posted its source code to Usenet, allowing researchers to learn how it mitigated
 chunki system strot kaa anaadhikrut upyog rokane ke liye software ko aksar suraksha vyavastha ke saath dijin kiya jaataa he, kai virus ek system yaa anuprayog main software bag ko failane main madad karte hai
 Software development strategies that produce a large number of bugs also normally enable efficient exploitation
 kai upyog karta virus virdohi software install karte hai, jo computer downlod ke baad yaa nishpaadan yogya ke chalane ke baad gyaat virus kaa pataa laga lete hai yaa use nasht kar dete hai
 There are two common methods that an anti-virus software application employs to detect viruses
 virus kii jaanch kii pehali or sabase saamaanya vidhi he virus ke hastakshar paribhaasha kii suchi kaa upyog
yah computer kii smriti ke avyavon or boot kshetra ) or sthaayee yaa asthaayee drivon par sangruhit sanchikaon kii jaanch ke dwaara, kaary karata he tathaa in sanchikaon kii tulana gyaat virus ke "hastakshar" ke database ke kilaaf kii jaati he
 The disadvantage of this method of investigation is that the user is only protected from viruses that keep updating their previous definitions
 duusari vidhi he anumaani kalan vidhi jisamen saamaanya vyavhaar par aadhaarit virason kaa pataa lagaaya jaataa he
 This method has the ability to detect viruses for which anti-virus companies still have to create signatures
 kuch virus virdohi program khuli hui sanchikaon ko scan karne main sakasham hote hai saath hi samaan tareeke se 'on the fly' bheje gaye or praapt kiye gaye i-mels ko bhi scan kar sakate hai
 This is called "on-access scanning"
 virus virdohi software poshi software ki virus ko preshit karne kii kshamta ko parivartit nahin karata he
 Users should update their software regularly for patch security holes
 Anti-virus software also needs to be updated regularly to prevent modern threats
 Regular backup of data on different media Can reduce the damage caused by viruses, either unconnected to the system, kept, or for other reasons such as a different file system Can not be opened for use not or only kept read-only
 is tarah, yadi ek virus ke madhyam se data kho diya he, koi bhi byaap kaa upyog karke phir se shuru kar saktaa he
 If a backup session is closed on optical media such as cds and dvds, it becomes read-only and can no longer be infected with the virus
 isi tarah, boot yogya par ek oparating system kaa upyog computer ko shuru karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, yadi sthapit aaparating system upyog hin ho gaya he
 Another method is to use different operating systems on different file systems
 a virus is unlikely to affect both
 data byaap bhi bhinn sanchika tantron par daalaa ja saktaa he
 For example, Linux requires special software to write to an NTFS partition, so if no one installs the software and uses a separate installation of MS Windows to perform a backup on an NTFS partition, the backup Any version of Linux must be protected
 Likewise, MS Windows cannot read file systems such as ext3, so if one typically uses MS Windows Ta is, backups can be made on an ext3 partition using a Linux installation
 ek baar ek computer jab virus se samjhauta kar letaa he, to saamanyatya oparating system ko fir se puri tarah se install kiye bina samaan computer kaa upyog jari rakhana asurakshit hota he
 However, there are several options that are present after the virus arrives in the computer
 ye kriyaayein virus ke prakaar kii gambhirtha par nirbhar karti hai
 On Windows Me, Windows XP and Windows Vista is a tool known as System Restore that restores the registry and complex system file for the previous check point
 aksar ek virus ek system ko heng kar detaa he or ek isi ke baad se fir se boot hone par system ke ristor bindu main usee din se samasya aegi
pichley dinon se ristor bindu ko diya gaya kaam karnaa hota he, ab virus sangrahit sanchikaon ko sankramit nahin kar paata he
 However, some viruses disable system restore and other important tools such as task manager and command prompt
 ek virus jo aisa karata he uskaa udahaaran he ciadoor
prashaskon ke paas bhinn kaarnon ke liye simit upyogkartaaon se aise aujaaron ko niskriy karne ke vikalp uplabdh hai
 The virus modifies the registry to do this, not only when the administrator is controlling the computer, all of this prevents users from accessing the tools
 jab ek sankramit aujaar sakriy hota he to yah ek sandesh detaa he "aapke prashaasak ke dwaara task menager ko aksham kar diya gaya he
 "even if the program the user is trying to open is the administrator
 upyogkarta jo microsoft oparating system ko chalaa rahaa he, ek mukt scan chalaane ke liye microsoft kii website par ja saktaa he, yadi unke paas unka 20 ankon kii panjikaran sankhya he
 Reinstalling the operating system is a different way of virus removal
 isamen saadhaaran rup se OS vibhaajan kii punah formating or iske mul madhyam se OS ko install karnaa shaamil he
 Or a partition with a clean backup image can be visualized or taken with Acronis)
 The advantage of this method is that it is simpler to perform, faster than running multiple anti-virus scans, and Also guarantees to remove malware
 Downsides main anya sabhi software or oparating system kaa punah install karnaa shaamil he
 User data can be backed up by booting a live CD or placing the hard drive on another computer and booting from that computer's operating system
 vbfjg Salauddin: English an-nasirsalah ad-din Yusuf ibn Ayyub Birth: 1138, died 4 March 1193 was a twelfth-century Kurdish Muslim warrior who lived in contemporary northern Iraq
 us samay ke desh syria or mistra kaa shaasha tha syria or mistra ke sultan nuruddin jangi kii mrityu ke baad uske do bhai shashan karne lage ,lekin jab ek ke baad donon bhaaiyo kii mrityu ho gai to ab nuruddin jangi kaa sabase bafadaar or kareebi salauddin ko shaasha banaaya gaya
 When Salauddin conquered Jerusalem in 1187, the Pope's call was attacked by King of England, Richard da Line Hart, King of France and King of Germany, Federic's army, but Saludin defeated Federica's forces in different wars
 vah jitna bada yoddha tha, utana hi bada or kushal shaasha tha
 Along with this, there was justice and mercy also
 yahi kaaran he ki europe ke itihaaskaar bhi uske sammaan or mahanata main prasansha karte he
 Once, when the ruler of England, Richard of England, conquered the fort of Accra from the Muslims and the Muslim army surrounded the fort and the war started, at the same time Richard fell ill and was not getting any good Hakim, then Salauddin gave his Hakim Sent to Richard with medicines and got him treated
 islamic itihaaskaar to yah tak kah dete hai ki islamic rashidun khalifaaon ke baad itnaa kushal shaasha charitravaan or yoddha koi nahin hua
 The christian-muslim dynasty marked a turning point after his campaigns at the end of the twelfth century, and the European Christians who came to occupy Jerusalem were eliminated
 crossed yudhdo main isaiyon ko haraane ke baavjood uski europe main chhavi ek kushal yoddha tathaa vinamr sainik kii tarah he
 In 1898, King Wilhelm II of Germany also gave money to decorate Salauddin's tomb
 uski mrityu ke samay uske paas kuch dirham maatr hi the ,kyonki vah apni aay ko logo kii bhalaai ke liye kharch kar detaa tha
 At the time of his death, his friends also got involved together
 salauddin kii prasiddhi is baat se kii ja sakati he ki philistin main bachche uske shorya kaa gaan karte huue kehete hai - "naah nu ul muslimin, kullu nus salauddin" means that we are the sons of Muslims and all of us are Salauddin

 There is no mention of him in the Bible between 13 and 29 years
 30 varsh kii umr main unhone yuhanna se pani main dubkee lee
 After the dip, the Holy Spirit arrived on Jesus
 40 din ke upwas ke baad isa logon ko shiksha dene lage
 At the age of thirty, Jesus began to propagate a new form of Judaism to the people of Israel
 us samay tees saal se kam umr vaale ko sabhagrih me shaastra padhane ke liye or upadesh dene ke liye nahi diya karte the
 He said that God is a true love and does not want the sacrifices and rituals of the present-day Judaism
 yahudee ishwar kii parampriy nasl nahin he, ishwar sabhi mulkon ko pyaar karata he
 Man should not take revenge in anger and learn to forgive
 unhone spasht rup se kaha ki ve hi ishwar ke putr hai, ve hi messiah hai or swarg or mukti kaa maarg hai
 The Day of Judgment had no special mention or significance in Judaism, but Jesus emphasized the Day of Judgment - because heaven or hell would receive the human soul at the same time
 isa ne kai chamatkaar bhi kiye
 The rabbinic rabbis of the Jews strongly opposed Jesus
 unhen isa main maseehaa jaisaa kuch khaas nahin laga
 He loved his rituals
 khud ko ishvarputra bataanaa unke liye baari paap tha
 Therefore, he complained to the Roman governor Pilate at that time
 romanon ko hameshaa yahudee kranti kaa dar rahata tha
 So to appease the fanatics, Pilate sentenced Jesus to a painful death on the cross
 bible ke mutabiq, romi sainikon ne isa ko kodon se maaraa
 He was dressed in royal clothes, decorated with a crown of thorns on his head and spit on them, thus making him the "king of the Jews" in Tauheen
 peeth par apana hi cross uthavaake, romiyon ne unhen galgata tak liya, jahaan par unhen cross par latakaana tha
 On reaching Galgata, he was offered a mixture of liqueur and bile
 us yug main yah mishran mrityudand kii atyant dard ko kam karne ke liye diya jaataa tha
 Jesus denied it
 bible ke mutabiq, isa do chor ke bich cross par latakaaya gaya tha
 Christians believe that while dying on the cross, Jesus had taken the sins of all human beings on Himself and therefore, whoever believes in Jesus, will get heaven
 mrityu ke teen din baad isa vaapis ji uthe or 40 din baad sidhe swarg chale gaye
 The 12 disciples of Jesus spread their new religion everywhere
 yahi dharm isai dharm kahalaaya
 When Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Judea, in the days of Herod King, behold, many astrologers from the East came to Jerusalem and asked
 ki yahudiyon kaa raja jis kaa janm hua he, kahaan he? kyonki ham ne purv main uskaa tara dekha he or us ko pranaam karne aae hai
 Hearing this, Herod the king and all Jerusalem with him were terrified
 or us ne logon ke sab mahayajakon or shastriyon ko ikatthe karke un se poocha, ki messiah kaa janm kahan hona chahie? unhone us se kaha, yahudiya ke baitalaham main; kyonki bhavishyadvaktaa ke dwaara yon likhaa he
 That you, Bethlehem, who is in the land of Judah, you are by no means the least among the officials of Judah; For out of you will come a ruler, who will take care of my people Israel
 tab herodes ne jyotishiyon ko chupake se bulaakar un se poocha, ki tara thik kis samay dikhaai diya tha
 And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "go and find out exactly about that child, and when he meets, tell me the news so that i too may come and bow to him
" ve raja kii baat sunakar chale gaye or dekho, jo tara unhone purv main dekha tha, vah un ke aage aage chalaa or janha balak tha, us jagah ke upar panhuchakar thahar gaya
 us taare ko dekhakar ve ati anandit hue
 And when he reached that house, he saw the child with his mother Mary and fell down on his face and bowed to him; And he opened his bag and offered him gold and myrrh and myrrh
 or swapn main yah chituni paakar ki herodes ke paas phir na janaa, ve duusare maarg se hokar apane desh ko chale gaye
 un ke chale jane ke baad dekho, prabhu ke ek doot ne swapn main yusuf ko dikhaai dekar kaha, uth; us balak ko or us kii mata ko lekar misr desh ko bhaag ja; or jab tak main tujh se na kahuun, tab tak vahiin rahanaa; kyonki herodes is balak ko dhundhane par he ki use marava daale
 He got up at night and took the boy and his mother and went to Egypt
 or herodes ke marane tak vahiin rahaa; isaliye ki vah vachan jo prabhu ne bhavishyadvaktaa ke dwaara kaha tha ki main ne apane putr ko misr se bulaayaa puraa ho
 When Herod saw that the astrologers had mocked me, he was filled with anger; And sending people to Bethlehem and all the boys around it, who were two years old or younger, according to the exact time asked by the astrologers
 tab jo vachan yirmayaah bhavishyadvaktaa ke dwaara kaha gaya tha, vah puraa hua, ki ramah main ek karun-naad sunai diya, ronaa or bada vilaap, rahel apane baalkon ke liye ro rahi thi or shant hona na chaahati thi, kyonki ve hai nahin
 herodes ke marane ke baad dekho, prabhu ke doot ne misr main yusuf ko swapn main dikhaai dekar kaha
 Take up the child and his mother and go into the land of Israel; Because those who wanted to kill the child died
 vah uthaa or balak or us kii mata ko saath lekar israel ke desh main aayaa
 But upon hearing that Arkylaus is ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there; And after getting a reminder of the dream, he went into the land of Galilee
 or nasarat naam nagar main ja basaa; taaki vah vachan puraa ho, jo bhavishyadvaktaaon ke dwaara kaha gaya tha, ki vah nasri kehalaayegaa
 And the child grew and grew strong and filled with wisdom; And the grace of God was on him
 uske mata-pita prati varsh fasah ke parv main jerushlem ko jaaya karte the
 When he was twelve years old, he went to Jerusalem according to the festival
 or jab ve un dinon ko puraa karke lautne lage, to vah ladkaa yishu jerushlem main rah gaya; or yah uske mata-pita nahin jaanate the
 They, thinking that he would be with the other travelers, went off for a day: and began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances
 par jab nahin mila, to dhundhate-dhundhate jerushlem ko phir laut gaye
 And after three days they found him sitting among the preachers in the temple, listening to them and questioning them
 or jitne us kii sun rahe the, ve sab us kii samaj or uske uttaron se chakit the
 Then they were surprised to see him and his mother said to him; Son, why did you treat us like this? See, your father and i used to look for you with a grudge
 us ne un se kaha; tum mujhe kyon dhundhate the? kya nahin jaanate the, ki mujhe apane pita ke bhawan main hona avashya he? parantu jo baat us ne un se kahi, unhone use nahin samajha
 Then he went with them and came to Nazareth and was under their control; And his mother kept all these things in her mind
 And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in the grace of God and men
 chhathwein maheene main parameshwar kii ore se jibrail swargadoot galeel ke nasarat nagar main ek kunvaari ke paas bheja gaya
 Whose marriage was made to a man of the house of David named Joseph: the virgin was named Mary
 or swargadoot ne uske paas bheetar aakar kaha; anand or jai teri ho, jis par ishwar kaa anugrah hua he, prabhu tere saath he
 She was very nervous with that promise and started thinking, what kind of greeting is this? The angel said to him, Mary! Do not be afraid, because the grace of God is upon you
 or dekh, tu garbhvatee hogi or tere ek putr utpann hoga; tu uskaa naam yishu rakhana
 that would be great; And will be called the son of the Most High; And the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David
 or vah yaqub ke gharaane par sadaa rajya karegaa; or uske rajya kaa ant na hoga
 Mary said to the angel, how will this happen? i do not even know the man
 swargadoot ne us ko uttar diya; ki pavitra aatma tujh par utrega or parampradhan kii samarth tujh par chaaya karegi isaliye vah pavitra jo utpann honevaala he, parameshwar kaa putr kehalaayegaa
 Jesus showed many more signs to the disciples, which were not written in this book
 parantu ye isaliye likhe gaye hai, ki tum vishwaas karo, ki yishu hi parameshwar kaa putr messiah he: or vishwaas kar ke uske naam se jivan paao

 It is also not believed that he hung on the cross
 islamic parampara ke mutabiq, cross par marane ke ba-vajood, ishwar ne unhen sidhe swarg main uthaaya gaya tha
 Like all prophets, Jesus Christ is called a Muslim in the Quran
 quran ke mutabiq, isa messiah ne apane aap ko ishwar-putr kabhi nahin mana or ve qayamat ke din par is baat kaa inkaar karenge
 The Muslims believe that on the Day of Judgment, Jesus Christ will return to Earth and exercise justice
 quran main isa kaa naam 25 baar aayaa he
 There is a story of his birth in Surah Maryam and similarly in Surah Ali Imran
 mohammad ke hadison main he ki "tamaam nabi bhai he or isa messiah mere sabase kareebi bhai he kyunki mere or isa messiah ke darmiyaan koi nabi nahi aayaa he"
 Jesus said to them, It is written like this; That Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day
 or jerushlem se lekar sab jatiyon main man phiraav kaa or paapon kii kshamaa kaa prachaar, usee ke naam se kiya jayega

 or dekho, jis kii pratigya mere pita ne kii he, main us ko tum par utaaruunga or jab tak swarg se samarth na paao, tab tak tum isi nagar main tehre raho
tab vah unhen baitaniyyah tak baahar le gaya or apane haath uthaakar unhen ashish di
 And blessing them, he broke away from them and was taken from heaven
 or ve us ko dandvat karke bade anand se jerushlem ko laut gaye
 And constantly present in the temple and praise God
 yahudee isa messiah ko na to maseehaa maanate hai na ishwar-putr
