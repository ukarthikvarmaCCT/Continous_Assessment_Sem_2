 According to the proverbial opinion, if a driver crushes someone from his car while speeding and inadvertently driving a motor, he cannot be called a criminal if he does not have any sense of guilt
 paramparaagat manyataon ke anusaar dandabhiyog kii purnataa ke liye do chijen avashya hai - If someone looks at the things inside the house from the window of someone's house with the intention of stealing and returns by planning to steal at night, then he cannot be prosecuted for the crime of theft, because the scheme of the criminal mind Was not implemented, even if he was guilty of trespassing into another's house

 Will be guilty simultaneously; Even if Swami had not been informed of the work of the servant or the error in the prescribed work, or why the servant had not done the work against the command of the Swami or had been disappointed in doing the prescribed work
 dandabhiyog ke bhinn-bhinn kaaran ho sakate hai; yatha, kshanik aaveg, bhavukta, purvavichaar, bhavi vinaash se raksha, aadi

 In March 1856, through a letter, he completely announced his discovery to his representative in Calcutta

 Vogue concluded about XV that "it is more probable that it is the tallest in the world"

 saanchaa:lumbinika-sthaan-aadharlekh If Hindi literature is considered in proper perspective then it is clear that the history of Hindi literature is very detailed and ancient
 suprasiddh bhashaa vaigyanik dow0 hardev bahari ke shabdon main, hindi sahitya kaa itihaas vastutah vaidic kaal se armbh hota he
 It is only right to say that Vedic language is Hindi
 is bhashaa kaa durbhaagya rahaa he ki yug-yug main iskaa naam parivartit hota rahaa he
 Sometimes 'vedic', sometimes 'sanskrit', sometimes 'prakrit', sometimes 'apabhransh' and now - Hindi

 But it is worth noting that the languages of Hebrew, Russian, Chinese, German and Tamil etc
 which are described as 'very old' also have a difference of ground and sky in the ancient and present forms; But people did not change the names of those languages and their changed forms were called 'ancient', 'medieval', 'modern' etc
, whereas in the context of 'hindi', the language of each era was renamed
 hindi bhashaa ke udbhav or vikaas ke sambandh main prachlit dharanaon par vichaar karte samay hamaare saamne hindi bhashaa kii utpatti kaa prashn dasvin shatabdi ke aasapaas kii prakritabhas bhashaa tathaa apbhransh bhashaaon kii ore jaataa he
 It is also necessary to consider the rationale and evidence presented in the history books of Hindi literature to establish the etymology of the word Apabhramsa and the relationship of Hindi to the Apabhramsa works of Jain creators
 saamanytah praakrit kii antim apbhransh-avasthaa se hi hindi sahitya kaa aavirbhaav sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 At that time, there were many forms of apabhramsa and in them the verse-making started from the seventh-eighth century
 sahitya kii drushti se padhyabaddh jo rachanaayen milti hai ve doha rup main hi hai or unke vishay, dharm, niti, upadesh aadi pramukh hai
 Rajashrita used to show his literary interest by describing poets and bard policy, sringar, valor, valor etc

 The use of the old apostrophe language and the native language of the colloquium continued to grow
 is bhashaa ko vidyapati ne desi bhashaa kaha he, kintu yah nirnay karnaa saral nahin he ki hindi shabd kaa prayog is bhashaa ke liye kab or kis desh main prarambh hua
 Yes, it can definitely be said that initially the word Hindi was used by foreign Muslims
 is shabd se unka taatpary 'bhartiya bhashaa' kaa tha
 From the earliest period to modern and post-modern period, the names of literature history writers can be counted

 After this, compositions of Jains are found
 swayambhu kaa "paumchariu' athwa ramayana aathvin shatabdi kii rachana he
 The creations of Buddhists and Nathpanthis are liberating and just religious, but many of the Jains are also related to the common sensations of life
 inamen se kai prabandhkavy hai
 In the same period, Abdurrahman's poem "sandeshrasak" was also written in which language is found near the later colloquial
 is prakaar gyarahavin shatabdi tak puraani hindi kaa rup nirmit or viksit hota rahaa
 Around the eleventh century, the language of the country language started becoming more vibrant

 The superstitions practiced by Siddhas and Yogis etc
 are spreading in public
 the, shastragyansampann varg main bhi roodhiyon or aadambar kii pradhanta ho chali thi
 Due to the influence of Mayanism, feelings of public opinion and inaction were beginning to flourish in the society
 aise samay main bhaktiandolan ke rup main aisa bharatvyaapee vishaal saanskrithik andolan uthaa jisane samaaj main uthkarshvidhayak saamaajik or vaiyaktik mulyon kii pratishtha kii
 The Bhakti movement began around the tenth century by the Alwar saints of the south
 vahaan shankaracharya ke advaitamat or mayawad ke virodh main chaar vaishnav sampradaay khadey hue
 These four sects propagated the incarnations of Vishnu in North India
 inamen se ek ke pravartak ramanujacharya the, jinaki shishyparampara main aanevaale ramanand ne uttar bharat main rambhakti kaa prachaar kiya
 Ramananda's Rama was a replacement for Brahma who incarnated in the world to destroy the demons and expand his pastimes
 bhakthi ke kshetra main ramanand ne oonchnich kaa bhedbhaav mitaane par vishesh bal diya
 He influenced two devotees - Kabir and Tulsi, who believed in the two forms of Ram's virtue and nirguna
 vishnuswami ke shuddhadvait mat kaa aadhaar lekar isi samay vallabhacharya ne apana pushtimaarg chalaaya
 From the twelfth to the sixteenth centuries a number of cults were established throughout the country on the basis of Puranasamat Krishnanacharitra, the most influential of which was the confirmation of Vallabh
 unhone shankar mat ke viruddh brahm ke sagun rup ko hi vaastavik kaha
 According to his opinion, this world is not a spread of falsehood or maya, but is a spread of Brahma, so it is true
 unhone krishna ko brahm kaa avatar mana or uski prapti ke liye bhakt kaa purna aatmasamarpan aavashyak batalaaya
 Devotion can be attained only by the grace or affirmation of God
 is sampradaay main upasna ke liye gopisenvallabh, lilapurushottam krishna kaa madhur rup sweekrut hua
 Thus in northern India, Vishnu's Rama and Krishna avatars became prominent
 is prakaar in vibhinn maton kaa aadhaar lekar hindi main nirgun or sagun ke naam se bhakthikavy kii do shakhaayen saath saath chalin
 There are two subdivisions of Nirgunamat - Gyanashrayi and Premashrayi
 pehle ke pratinidhi kabir or duusare ke jaaysi hai
 Sagunmat also flowed into two sub-sections - Rambhakti and Krishnabhakti
 pehle ke pratinidhi tulsi hai or duusare ke surdaas
 Kabir, the principal poet of the Jnanasrayi branch, has a combined influence of various religious trends and philosophical beliefs
 unki rachanaaon main dharmasudharak or samajasudharak kaa rup vishesh prakhar he
 He stressed the correctness of conduct
 bahyadambar, roodhiyon or andhvishwaason par unhone teevr kashaghat kiya
 By proclaiming the ability of humans, he aroused a sense of self-respect among the people of the lower class
 is shakha ke anya kavi raidas, dadu hai
 The most prominent poet of Premashrayi Dhara is Jayasi, whose "padmavat" has been specially praised for its poignant lovemaking, Katharas and natural art
 inaki anya rachanaaon main "akharavat' or "aakhri kalam' aadi hai, jinamein sufi sampradaaysangat baaten hai
 Other poets of this stream are Qutuban, Manjhan, Usman, Sheikh Nabi and Noor Muhammad etc
 aaj kii drushti se is sampurna bhakthikavy kaa mahatv uski dharmikata se adhik lokajeevanagat maanviya anubhutiyon or bhaavon ke kaaran he
 With this thought, devotees can be called the golden age of Hindi poetry

 ke aas paas hindi kavita main ek nayaa mode aayaa
 This was particularly stimulated by the immediate court culture and Sanskritic literature
 sanskrit sahityashastra ke katipay anshon ne use shastreey anushaasan kii ore pravrutt kiya
 In Hindi, the word 'riti' or 'poetry' was used for poetry
 isliye kavyashastrabaddh saamaanya srujanpravriti or ras, alankaar aadi ke nirupak bahusankhyak lakshangranthon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue is samay ke kavy ko 'reetikavy' kaha gaya
 The clearest signs of the old tradition of the poetic trends of this poetry are found in the adhikavya of Sanskrit, Prakrit, Apabhransh, Persian and Hindi and the sringari tendencies of Krishnakavya
 reetikavy rachana kaa aarambh ek sanskritgya ne kiya
 These were Acharya Keshavdas, whose famous compositions are Kavipriya, Rasikapriya and Ramachandrika
 keshav ke kai dashak baad chintamani se lekar atharahavin sadi tak hindi main reetikavy kaa ajasr strot pravaahit hua jisamen nar-nari-jivan ke romantic pakshon or tatsambandhi saras samvednaaon kii atyant kalatmak abhivyakti vyapak rup main hui
 The poets of Reetikal lived in the shelter of kings and nobles
 vahaan manoranjan or kalavilas kaa vaataavaran swaabhaavik tha
 The main means of intellectual enjoyment was considered idiomatic there
 aise vaataavaran main likhaa gaya sahitya adhiktar shringarmulak or kalavaichitraya se yukt tha
 But at the same time, there were also independent singers of Prem who have touched the depths of love
 maatra or kavyagun donon hi drushtiyon se is samay kaa nar-nari-prem or saundarya kii maarmik vyanjana karanevaala kavyasahitya mahatvapurn he
 Ritikavya is primarily a poetry of fleshy makeup
 isamen nar-narijivan ke smaraneey pakshon kaa sundar udghaatan hua he
 The more poetic is in the Muktak style, but there are also the Manavakyas
 in do sau varshon main shringaarakavy kaa apurv utkarsh hua
 But slowly the rituals grew and the poetry of Hindi poetry became narrow
 aadhunik yug tak aate aate in donon kamiyon kii ore sahityakaron kaa dhyaan vishesh rup se aakrisht hua
 See also - yah aadhunik yug kaa aarambh kaal he jab bharatiyon kaa europea samskruti se sampark hua
 In the work of establishing its roots in India, the British rule influenced and agitated Indian life at various levels
 nai paristhitiyon ke dhakke se sthitisheel jivanavidhi kaa dhaanchaa tuutane laga
 a new era of consciousness began
 sangharsh or saamanjasy ke nae aayam saamne aae
 The highest possibilities of New Age literature were rooted in Khadi Boli prose, so it is also called prose-era
 hindi kaa pracheen gadhy rajasthani, maithili or brajabhasha main miltaa he par vah sahitya kaa vyapak madhyam banane main ashakt tha
 The tradition of Khadiboli is ancient
 amir khusro se lekar madhyakaalin bhushan tak ke kavy main iske udhaaharan bikhare pade hai
 Old samples of Khadi Boli prose have also been found
 is tarah kaa bahut sa gadhy farsi or gurumukhi lipi main likhaa gaya he
 It developed in the name of "dakshini" in the Muslim principalities of the South
 atharahavin sadi main likhaa gaya ramprasad niranjani or daulataraam kaa gadhy uplabdh he
 But the Hindi prologue prose of Hindi as a conductor of the new era was widely spread since the nineteenth century
 kalkatte ke fort wiliam kalege main, navaagat angarej afasaron ke upyog ke liye, lallu laal tathaa sadal mishra ne gadhy kii pustaken likhakar hindi ke khadi boli gadhy kii purvaparampara ke vikaas main kuch sahaayta di
 The prose compositions of Munshi Sadasukhlal and Insha Alla Khan were written at this time
 aage chalakar press, patrapatrikaon, isai dharmprachaarkon tathaa naveen shiksha sansthaaon se hindi gadhy ke vikaas main sahaayta mili
 Residents of various provinces like Bengal, Punjab, Gujarat etc
 also contributed to its growth and spread
 hindi kaa pehla samachaarpatr "udant maartand' 1826 i
 main kalkatte se prakashit hua
 King Shivprasad and Raja Laxman Singh were instrumental in the creation and propagation of Hindi prose in their own way
 aryasamaj or anya saanskrithik andolanon ne bhi aadhunik gadhy ko aage badhaayaa
 The evolving tradition of prose literature began from the late nineteenth century
 iske pravartak aadhunik yug ke pravartak or pathpradarshak bhaaratendu harishchandra the jinhone sahitya kaa samakaleen jivan se ghanishtha sambandh sthapit kiya
 This was the era of solstice and renaissance
 angarejon kii kootnithik chaalon or aarthik shoshan se janata santrast or kshubdh thi
 While one section of the society was beset by Western rites, the other class was stuck in stereotypes
 isi samay nai shiksha kaa aarambh hua or saamaajik sudhaar ke andolan chale
 With the influence of new knowledge science, a new attitude towards life developed among the newly educated who was specially oriented towards present and future rather than past
 saamaajik vikaas main utpann aasthaa or jaagrath samudayachetana ne bharatiyon main jivan ke prati nayaa utsaah utpann kiya
 Contemporary literature of Bharatendu, especially in prose literature, gave a clear and live expression of the various stages of the then ideological and physical environment
 is yug kii naveen rachanaayen deshbhakti or samajasudhar kii bhaavana se paripurna hai
 The tendency of political and social satire also emerged due to the clash of many new situations
 is samay ke gadhy main bolchaal kii sajivta he
 Due to the personality of the writers, it has added enough interestingness to it
 sabase adhik niabandh likhe gaye jo vyaktipradhan or vichaarpradhan tathaa varnanaatmak bhi the
 Storytelling was also written in many genres, mostly educative
 par yathartwaadee drushti or nae shilp kii vishistataa shrinivas das ke "parikshaguru' main hi he
 [[devakinandan Khatri's Tilasmi novel 'chandrakanta' was published at this time

 Bharatendu, Pratapnarayan Mishra, Srinivasa Das, etc
 are prominent playwrights
 saath hi bhakthi or shringaar kii bahut si saras kavitaayen bhi nirmit hui
 But the poems in which social sentiments were expressed give an initial impression of the creativity of the new era
 khadi boli ke chhitroot prayogon ko chhod shesh kavitaayen brajabhasha main likhi gayin
 In fact, the new era was more rewarded in prose of this time
 is kalavadhi kii sabase mahatvapurn ghatnaayen do hai - ek to saamaanya kavyabhasha ke rup main khadi boli kii sweekruti or duusare hindi gadhy kaa niyaman or parimarjan
 The most powerful yoga in this work was that of Saraswati editor Mahavirprasad Dwivedi
 dvivedi ji or unke sahakarmiyon ne hindi gadhy kii abhivyaktikshmata ko viksit kiya
 In addition to Dwivedi in the field of essays, one to one careful, vigorous and lively prose stylists such as Balmukund, Chandradhar Sharma Guleri, Purnasingh, Padmasinh Sharma emerged
 upanyaas anek likhe gaye par uski yathartwaadee parampara kaa ullekhneey vikaas na ho sakaa
 Realistic modern stories were born and developed during this period
 guleri, kowshik aadi ke atirikt premchand or prasad kii bhi aarambhik kahaniyaan isi samay prakaash main ai
 The area of the drama was definitely deserted
 is samay ke sabase prabhaavshaalee sameekshak dvivedi ji the jinaki sanshodhanavaadee or maryaadanishth aalochana ne anek samakaleen sahitya ko paryaapt prabhavit kiya
 Mishrabandhu, Krishnabihari Mishra and Padmasinh Sharma are the other reviewers at this time, but overall the review of this period has been outwardly dominant
 sudhaarwadi aadarshon se prerit ayodhyasingh upaadhyaay ne apane "priypravas' main radha kaa loksevika rup prastut kiya or khadiboli ke vibhinn roopon ke prayog main nipunata bhi pradarshit kii
 Maithilisharan Gupta raised the voice of nationalism and social reform in "bharat Bharti" and revered Urmila in "saket"
 is samay ke anya kavi dvivedi ji, shridhar pathak, balmukund gupt, nathuram sharma 'shankar', gaya prasad shukla 'sanehi' aadi hai
 The representatives of Brajbhasha poetic tradition are Ratnakar and Satyanarayana Kaviratna
 is samay khadi boli kavyabhasha ke parimarjan or samayik parivesh ke anuroop rachana kaa kaary sampann hua
 Much of the new poetry is thoughtful and descriptive
 san 1920-40 ke do dashakon main aadhunik sahitya ke antargat vaicharik or kalatmak pravritiyon kaa anek rup utkarsh dikhaai padaa
 Novel and story received the highest popularity

 The sense of social contrast and class struggle became particularly vocal in this
 isane sahitya ko saamaajik kranti ke astr ke rup main grahan kiya
 Progressive literature, especially poetry, did not have much potential for artistic flourish due to the limitations of its utilitarian vision, yet it awakened a new consciousness by emphasizing the social side of literature
 pragativaadee andolan ke aarambh ke kuch hi baad nae manovigyaan yaa manovishleshanshastra se prabhavit ek or vyaktivaadee pravriti sahitya ke kshetra main sakriy hui thi jise san 1943 ke baad prayogwaad naam diya gaya
 The modified form of this is the present day new poetry and new stories

 One is Progressivism, which draws inspiration from Marx's materialistic biography; The second is experimentalism, which expressed the rapid reactions of its dissatisfaction to traditional ideals and institutions through innovative forms of literature
 isapar nae manovigyaan kaa gaharaa prabhaav padaa
 Among the storytellers influenced by progressivism are Yashpal, Upendranath Ashk, Amritlal Nagar and Nagarjuna
