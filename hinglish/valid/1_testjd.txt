 Emergency was declared in India for a period of 21 months from 26 June 1975 to 21 March 1977
 tatkaaleen raashtrapati fairuddin ali ahamed ne tatkaaleen bhartiya pradhanmantri indira gandhi ke kehane par bhartiya samvidhan kii dhara 352 ke adheen apatkaal kii ghoshnaa kar di
 This was the most controversial and undemocratic period in the history of independent India
 apatkaal main chunaav sthagit ho gaye tathaa naagarik adhikaron ko samaapt karke manamaani kii gai
 Indira Gandhi's political opponents were imprisoned and banned from the press
 pradhanmantri ke bete sanjay gandhi ke netritv main bade paimaane par purush nasbandi abhiyaan chalaaya gaya
 Jayaprakash Narayan called it 'the darkest period of Indian history'
 1967 or 1971 ke bich, pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne sarkaar or bhartiya rashtriya congress party ke saath hi sansad main baari bahumat ko apane niyantran main kar liya tha
 Instead of the Union Cabinet, central government power was concentrated within the Prime Minister's Secretariat
 sachivalay ke nirvaachit sadasyon ko unhone ek khatra ke rup main dekha
 For this he relied on his principal secretary PN Haksar, who was in the inner circle of Indira's advisors
 iske alaava, parameshwar narayan haksar ne sattarudh party kii vichaardhaara "patibaddh naukarshahi" ke vichaar ko badhaava diya
 Indira Gandhi cleverly alienated her rivals, causing the Congress to split and in 1969 — two parts, the Congress and the Congress that were on Indira's side, were split
 akhil bhartiya congress cameti or congress saansadon ke ek bade bhaag ne pradhanmantri kaa saath diya
 Indira Gandhi's party was stronger than the old Congress and a strong institution with traditions of internal democracy
 duusari or congress ke sadasyon ko jaldi hi samaj main aa gaya ki unki pragati indira gandhi or unke parivaar ke liye apni vafadari dikhne par puri tarah nirbhar karti he or chatukaarita kaa dikhaawati pradarshit karnaa unki dincharya ban gaya
 In the coming years, Indira's influence grew so much that she could establish self-elected loyalists as chief ministers of states, rather than members elected by the Congress Legislature Party
 indira kii us sarkaar ke paas janata ke bich unki karishmai apil kaa samarthan praapt tha
 Another reason for this was the decisions taken by the government
 isamen july 1969 main pramukh bainkon kaa rashtriyakaran va sitambar 1970 main rajbhate se unmoolan shaamil hai; ye faisle apane virodhiyon ko saarvbhaumik jhatka dene ke liye, adhyadesh ke madhyam se achaanak kiye gaye the
 Subsequently, unlike Syndicate and other opponents, Indira was seen as an "image of the poor pro, in matters of religion, with economics and secularism and socialism standing for the development of the entire country
" " pradhanmantri ko vishesh rup se vanchit virgon-garib, daliton, mahilaon or alpsankhyakon dwaara bahut samarthan mila
 For her, she was his Indira Amma
 1971 ke aam chunaavon main, "garibi hataao" kaa indira kaa loklubhaavan naaraa logon ko itnaa pasand aayaa ki puraskaar swarup unhen ek vishaal bahumat se jeeta diya
 "with regard to such a huge margin of victory, historian Ramachandra Guha later wrote that" Congress stands as the real Congress
 It does not require any suffix to show merit
 " In December 1971, under his active war leadership, India gave East Pakistan independence from its arch-enemy Pakistan
 agle maheene hi unhen bharat ratna se sammanit kiya gaya, vah us samay apane charam par thim; unki jeevani lekhak inder malhotra, ke liye 'bharat kii samraji' ke rup main unka varnan" upyukt lag rahaa tha
 Opposition leaders, who routinely accused him of being a dictator and promoting a personality cult, also considered him Durga Saman
 1975 kii tapati garmi ke dauraan achaanak bhartiya raajnneeti main bhi bechaini dikhi
 All this happened with the judgment of the Allahabad High Court in which Indira Gandhi was found guilty of rigging the election and she was banned from holding any position for six years
 lekin indira gandhi ne is faisale ko maanane se inkaar karte hue sarvocch nyaayalay main apil karne kii ghoshnaa kii or 26 june ko apatkaal lagu karne kii ghoshnaa kar di gai
 In her message broadcast on AIR, Indira Gandhi said, "ever since i have taken some progressive steps for the benefit of the common man and the women of the country, there was a deep conspiracy against me
 " As soon as the Emergency came into force, political opponents were arrested under the Internal Security Act, including Jayaprakash Narayan, George Fernandes and Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 maamla 1971 main hue loksabhaa chunaav kaa tha, jisamen unhone apane mukhya pratidwandvi raaj narayan ko parajeet kiya tha
 But four years after the election results came, Raj Narayan challenged the election result in the High Court
 unki daleel thi ki indira gandhi ne chunaav main sarkari mashinari kaa durupyog kiya, tay seemaa se adhik kharch kiye or matadaataaon ko prabhavit karne ke liye galat tareekon kaa istemaal kiy
 The court upheld these allegations
 iske baavjood indira gandhi tus se mas nahin huin
 Even the Congress party issued a statement saying that Indira's leadership is indispensable for the party
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ko pratibandhit kar diya gaya kyonki mana gaya ki yah sanghathan vipakshi netaaon kaa kareebi he tathaa iskaa bada sanghathanaatmak aadhaar sarkaar ke viruddh virodh pradarshan karne kii sambhaavna rakhata tha
 The police cracked down on this organization and thousands of its activists were imprisoned
 aresas ne pratibandh ko chunauti di or hajaaron swayamsevakon ne pratibandh ke khilaaf or moulik adhikaron ke hanan ke khilaaf satyagrah main bhaag liya
 The whole of India was in a state of shock after the leaders of all opposition parties and other outspoken critics of the government were arrested and sent behind bars
 apatkaal kii ghoshnaa ke kuch hi samay baad, sikh netritv ne amritsar main baithkon kaa aayojan kiya jahaan unhone "congress kii fasivadi pravriti" kaa virodh karne kaa sankalp kiya
 The first mass protest in the country was organized by the Akali Dal which is known as the "campaign for the Defense of Democracy"
 ise 9 july ko amritsar main shuru kiya gaya tha
 Nearly two years after the imposition of the Emergency, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi recommended dissolution of the Lok Sabha and holding elections
 chunaav main apatkaal lagu karne kaa faisalaa congress ke liye ghaatak sabit hua
 Indira Gandhi herself lost the election to her stronghold Rae Bareli
 janata party baari bahumat se satta main ai or morarji desai pradhanmantri bane
 The number of Congress members in Parliament was reduced from 350 to 153 and after 30 years a non-congress government was formed at the Center
 congress ko uttar pradesh, bihar, punjab, haryana or dilli main ek bhi seat nahin mili
 The Shah Commission was constituted by the new government to investigate the decisions taken during the Emergency
 haalaanki nai sarkaar do saal hi tik pai or andruni antarvirodhon ke kaaran 1979 main sarkaar gir gai
 Deputy Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh raised the question of dual membership of some ministers who were also members of the Jana Sangh
 isi mudde par charan singh ne sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya or congress ke samarthan se unhone sarkaar banaai lekin chali sirf paanch maheene

 Tying the ends of a dupatta means the emergence of a new entity from both the bodies and the body as a joint entity

 In Granthibandhan, money, flower, Durva, Haridra and Akshat also tie these five things

 It should not happen that you love each other, but start ignoring the family members

 It should not happen that neither of the two should confine anyone to their personal self-help, it should not facilitate social service
 is dishaamein lagane vaale samay va dhan kaa virodh kare
 Akshat indicates that both of you are not only made for each other, but the fast and responsibility of social service is also present as an important goal in the contribution of your people
 pushp kaa arth he, hanste-khilte rahanaa
 Be ready to spread fame and praise to make each other fragrant
 koi kisi kaa duusare ke agen to apmaan kare or na tiraskaar
 Thus, by keeping these five, Durva, Pushp, Haridra, Akshat and Paisa, both are formed and it is hoped that the goals with which they are tied together will keep them alive for a lifetime
 vyakti karen
 The ends of the dupatta should be knotted together and put Mars-matter in it

 Unix had one drawback - it is difficult to understand and operate
 andrew tenenbam, aimusterdam main computer vigyaan ke professor hai
 He wrote a program called Minix to help it
 isamen bhi kuch kamiyaan thim
 Linus Torvald was a computer science student at the University of Helsinki, Finland
 unhone minix kii kami ko dur karne ke liye ek program likhaa jo ki baad main ‘linus kaa unics’ yaa chote main linaks kahalaaya
 His first core or Karnal was posted in Internet in 1991
 tab tak richard stallmen kaa 'gnu' project shuru ho chukaa tha
 Linus Torvald took many programs from this in his Linux
 isliye richard stallmen kaa kahana he
 That it should be called 'gnu-linux'
 par yah naam, shaayad lambaa rahane ke kaaran chal nahin paaya
 But this does not mean that the GNU project is not involved in the success of Linux
 gnew project ke bina linaks sambhav nahin tha
 The Unix operating system was conceived and implemented at AT & T's Bell Laboratories in the United States in 1969 by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas mcilroy and Joe Ossan
 unics pehali baar 1971 main relies hua, or puri tarah se assembly bhashaa main likhaa gaya tha, jaisaa ki us samay aam abhyaas tha
 Later, in a major pioneering approach in 1973, it was written by Dennis Ritchie in some programming language
 unics ke ucch stareey bhashaa karyanvayan kii uplabdhta ne vibhinn computer platformon ko apane porting ko aasaan bana diya
 Due to an antitrust case prior to entering the Computer Enterprise case, AT&T was required to license the operating system's source code to anyone
 natijatan, unics jaldi bad gaya or academik sansthaanon or vyavsaayon dwaara vyapak rup se apanaaya gaya
 In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs; Free of legal liability requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product, where users were not legally allowed to modify Unix
 richard stollman dwaara 1983 main shuru hui jienyu pariyojna kaa lakshya "purna unics-sangat software system" banane kaa lakshya tha jo puri tarah se muft software se bana tha
 Work began in 1984
 baad main, 1985 main, stallman ne free software foundation kii shuruyaat kii or 1989 main jienyu general public license likhaa
 By the early 1990s, many programs (text editors, Unix shells, and a windowing system) required in an operating system were complete, although device drivers, daemons, and kernels, called GNU / Herd, were low-level
 The elements were intercepted and incomplete
 linas torwaldas ne kaha he ki yadi us samay jienyu karnel uplabdh to, usne apana khud kaa likhane kaa faisla nahin kiya hoga
 Minix was created by computer science professor Andrew S
 Tanenbaum, and was released in 1987 as an Unix-like operating system targeted at students and others who wanted to learn operating system principles
 haalanki MINIX kaa puraa strot code swatantra rup se uplabdh tha, licencing sharton ne april 2000 main licencing badalane tak ise muft software hone se roka

 chunki ye anuprayog internet ke madhyam se prayukt hote hai atah prayokta apni sabsakribd feed ko jahaan bhi internet sampark uplabdh ho vahaan pard saktaa he
 Modern compilers use technologies like Agax and are also available as multiple widgets
 vyaktigat sankalkon ke alaava saamudayik sankalak bhi hote hai jo saamanytah kisi laghu samudaay ke feed kaa sankalan karte hai
 For example, see the page of the list of compilers at the end of the article
 clyant yaa desktop anuprayog kaa zyaadaatar computer par baqayda sthaapan kiya jaataa he
 Their graphical user interface is similar to most popular email clients such as Outlook, with a draft showing in most three panels, a list of subscribed feeds on the left, which can be grouped into groups, folders, or squares, and a draft entry in the right panel
 kai anuprayogon main tikar tepe yaa news tikar yaa alert ke rup main nai pravishtiyon ke bare main jaankaree hasil kii ja sakati he
 Many programming languages provide libraries that application builders or website owners can read feeds using or display or use in different formats

 Media compilers, also known as podcatchers due to the popularity of podcasts, are compilers of feeds in which the draft is primarily audio or video
 feed main ye ke rup main daale jate hai
 These can be mesh or desktop based applications
 ye media ko downlod kar use chalaa sakate hai yaa ypod jaise kisi bahari media player ke saath sikronies bhi kar sakate hai
 Content redundancy is a fundamental problem with compilers, especially if the user is a reader of multiple feeds
 sankalak alag alag taur par is samasya se nibatate hai
 In addition to facilitating the categorization of feeds to the user, they take advantage of the tags and keywords attached to the entries

 Three phase electric power or Trikala electric power is the most popular method of generation, transmission and distribution and use of alternating current in the present time
 yah ek prakaar kii bahufeji pranali he
 There are many benefits of three phage power

 In a three-phase system, there is no interconnecting of three wires at 120 degrees of time
 ye teenon ek hi aavriti hai
 By Kalantar it means that these currents occur at different points at their maximum value, not at the same time

 There can also be a fourth wire in a three-phase system called a neutral wire

 Three different colored wires are often used for the three phases

 Neutral is taken from black color and meaning from light green wire
 teen phej vaali kisi raashi ke teenon phejon ko nimnlikhit rup nen nirupit kar sakate hai- If G1 = G2 = G3, the system is called 'balanced', otherwise 'unbalanced'

 dhyatavya he ki kala anukram badalane ke liye keval kinhin do phejon ko aapas main badalanaa hota he 
 Similarly, a power converter connected to a three-phase with a SCR can also do wrong or malfunction if the three-phase power supply sequence to it is changed
 kintu yadi us power conwarter kii electronic budhimaan ho to kala kaa anukram badalane par bhi thik se kaam karata rahegaa or koi samasya nahin aayegi

 He was a disciple of Vedavyas
 jaimini vedavyas ke shishy the
 It is written in Mahabharata that Veda Vyasa got the name because of expanding the Veda into four parts
 inhone jaimini ko samaveda kii shiksha di tathaa mahabharat bhi padhaayaa- These Vyas composed the Brahmasutra, based on the Upanishads
 isi ko "bhikshusutra" bhi kehete hai jiskaa ullekh panini ne ashtaadhi main kiya he
 It is clear from these episodes that Jaimini was a contemporary sage of Ved Vyasa
 vedavyas ne kauravon or pandavon ko saakshaat dekha tha
 Therefore, they must have lived in the war period of Mahabharata
 winternitz ke anusaar mahabharat kii rachana isa se purv chauthi sadi main hui hogi, kintu bhartiya vidwaanon ke anusaar 3000 varsh isa se purv hi mahabharat kaa samay ho saktaa he
 Therefore, the time of Ved Vyas will also have to be decided accordingly
 panini ne apni ashtaadhi main jis bhikshusutra kaa ullekh kiya he uske rachayita bhi yahi vedavyas hai jinhen baadaraayan vyas bhi ham kehete hai or isiliye yah baadaraayan sutara bhi kehalaata he
 Despite many opinions regarding the period of Panini, according to scholars like Goldsterk, Vasudevashran Agarwal, etc
, it must have been around 6000 years BC, it can be said
 satyavrath samashrami kaa kahana he ki jaimini niruktkaar yask ke purvavarti hai
 Yask is the predecessor of Panini
 samashrami ne yask ko isa se purv 19veen sadi main mana he
 Ved Vyasa mentions Jaimini 11 times in the Brahmasutra, Javini is also mentioned by the name "acharya" in the Ashavayana Grihamsutra (1

 Similarly, Jaimini has mentioned the opinion of Badarayan five times in his predecessor book, taking his name
 is prakaar vedavyas ke saath jaimini kaa ghanishtha sambandh rakhana pramanit hota he
 Therefore, both of these must have been in the same period, it does not seem to be a flaw to believe such a theory
 paashchaatya vidwaanon ke anusaar jaimini isa se aath shatak purv hi rahe honge, kintu bhartiya vidwaanon ke anusaar isa se teen hajaar varsh purv jaimini kaa samay kehane main koi vishesh aapatti nahin maaloom hoti
 The following texts are famous by the name of Jaimini: samaveda kii ek hajaar shakhaayen huin jinamein keval kauthumi, jaimineey tathaa ranayaniya, ye hi teen shakhaayen aaj milti hai

 In addition, Jamini has also taken his name in Mimamsutra five times by himself

 He is often respected as a great mathematician, mystic and scientist; However some question the possibilities of his contributions to mathematics and natural philosophy
 herodots unhen "unaniyon ke bich sabase adhik sakasham darshanik" maanate hai
 His name connects him to Pythia and Apollo; Aristippus clarified his name by saying that "they spoke no less true than the Pythians," and Lumblikas tells a story that Pythia predicted that her pregnant mother would give birth to a very beautiful, intelligent child who would go to mankind

 Pythagoras, known as the "father of numbers", made significant contributions to religious teaching and philosophy in the sixth century BCE
 purv sukaraati kaal ke anya logon kii tulana main unke kaary ne katha kahaniyon ko adhik prabhavit kiya, unke jivan or shikshaaon ke bare main adhik vishwaas ke saath kaha ja saktaa he
 We know that Pythagoras and his disciples believed that everything is related to mathematics and that numbers are ultimately the reality and that everything can be predicted through mathematics and everything is aligned in a rhythmic pattern or cycle
 Can be measured in the form

 " wo pehle aadmi the jo apane aap ko ek darshanik, yaa buddhi kaa premi kehete the, or pithogoras ke vichaaron ne plato par ek bahut gaharaa prabhaav daalaa
 Unfortunately, very few facts are known about Pythagoras, as very few of his writings remain
 pithogoras kii kai uplabdhiyaan vastav main unke sahyogiyon or uttaradhikariyon kii uplabdhiyaan hai
 Pythagoras was born in Samos, a Greek island in the eastern Aegean, on the shores of Asia Minor

 When he was young, he left his place of birth and escaped from the tyrannical government of the Policrates and moved to Croton Celebria in southern Italy
 lamblicus ke anusaar thels unki kshamtaaon se bahut adhik prabhavit tha, usne pithogoras ko egypt main memphis ko chalane or vahaan ke pujaariyon ke saath adhyayan karne kii salaah di jo apni buddhi ke liye jane jate the
 He also served as a disciple in Tires and Bablos in Phenicia
 egypt main unhone kuch jyamitiya siddhanton ko sikhaa jisase prerit hokar unhone antat prameya di jo ab unke naam se jaani jaati he
 This possible inspiration is presented as an extraordinary problem in the Berlin papyrus
 samos se crotone, celebria, italy, aane par unhone ek gupt dharmik samaaj kii sthapana kii jo praarambhik orfic kalt se bahut adhik milti julati thi or sambhawatah usase prabhavit bhi thi
 Pythagoras tried to improve the cultural life of Croton, inspired citizens to follow virtue and established a group of followers around him who were called Pythegoreans

 This organization was in some ways a school, in some ways a brotherhood and in some ways a monastery
 yah pithogoras ke dharmik upadeshon par aadhaarit tha or bahut hi gupt tha
 First, the school was very much concerned with the morality of society
 sadasyon ko naitikta ke drushtikon ke saath jeena hota tha, ek duusare se pyaar karnaa hota tha, raajnneetik manyataon ko baantna hota tha, shanti kaa anusaran karnaa hota tha or swayan ko prakruti ke ganit ko samarpit kar dena hota tha
 The followers of Pythagoras were commonly called "pathogorians"

 Pythagoras observed a law of peace known as Ekmeithia, breaking this rule to be punished with death
 aisa isliye tha kyonki pithogoras kaa maananaa tha ki ek vyakti ke shabd aam taur par laaparvaahee se yukt hote hai, jisase uski galat abhivyakti hoti he or unke anusaar yadi kisi ko is baat par andeh he ki use kya kahana chahie to use hameshaa chup rahanaa chahie
 Another rule of his was that "anyone who should help in a trouble should not let it fall down, because it is a great sin to encourage inaction
" " or ve kehete the ki "apane ghar se nikal jane ke baad vaapis mat jaao, kyoki furis aapke saath honge," yah unhen yaad dilaataa tha ki sab kuch siikhe bina bahut kam seekhney se acha he sristi, bhagwaan or ganit ke bare main, sachai ko siikhnaa 
 In the biographical porphyry of Pythagoras, it is stated that "this peace was not an ordinary peace
 "pithogoriens ek aantarik sarkal methmeticoi or ek bahari sarkal akusameticoi main vibhajit the
 The Porphyry wrote that Methmetkoikois learned the knowledge more extensively, and Akusmatikoi listened to only the summary headings of Pythagoras's writings without any precise exposition
 lamblikaas ke anusaar akusameticoi aamayaham shishy the jo pithogoras ke vyakhyanon ko ek parde ke baahar se sunate the
 The Akausmatikoi were not allowed to see Pythagoras and were not taught the inner secrets of the cult

 His most important work is a book on the philosophical theory of the Golden Mean, at a time when women were considered to be the property of their husbands and only had to take care of their husbands' home, Pythagoras gave women equal status to work
 pithogoras ke samaaj main kai roak thim
 Like do not step on a crossbar and do not eat beans

 "even in ancient times, a derogatory title called Mysticos Logos was given to discredit Pythagoras
 faliyon par roak fevism se sambandhit ho sakati he jo bumadhya kshetra ke aas paas vyapak rup se failaa he
 The main point here is akousmata, meaning "rules", so that superstitious prohibitions were primarily applicable to the akousmeticoe and most of the rules came after the death of Pythagoras and were completely free from methmeticoe
 jo taarkik rup se pithogoras kii parampara ke vaastavik sangrakshak hai
 Methmetocycone emphasized more on the inside understanding than the acosmeticoin
 yahan tak ki kuch niyamon or puja paddatiyon ke vistaar par bhi bal diya
 For Methmetikoi to be Pythagorean means an innate quality and presence of inner understanding
 akusamata or -ke saath nipatane kaa ek or tarika bhi tha; unke pratik kathatmak chithran dwaara
 We have some examples of this, one is his explanation of Aristotle: "do not step on a balance", that is, do not be greedy; 'do not strike with a sword on fire ", that is, do not talk in sharp words to an angry person
 , "do not eat the heart" means do not hold yourself in sorrow etc
 hamaare paas paanchavin sadi isa purv tak ke pithogorian sajiv chithran ke saboot hai, iskaa matlab he ki aisi ajeeb baaten paheli ke rup main kahi gayi
 The Pythagoreans are also known for their theory of the transmigration of souls, as well as their theory that number is the true nature of things
 unhone shuddhikaran sanskaron ko apanaaya or jeene ke bhinn niyamon ko viksit kiya, ve aisa maanate the ki ye niyam devataaon ke bich unhen ek ucch pad ko praapt karne ke liye sakasham banaayenge
 Much of their mysticism appears to be keeping the soul integral to the orphic tradition
 orfiks ne kai parishodhak sanskaron ko apanaaya or saath hi anderworld main vibhinn vikaas sanskaron ko apanaaya
 Pythagoras is also closely related to Pherecidus of Ciroce, an ancient commentator who is believed to be the first Greek to teach the transmigration of souls
 pracheen tippaneekar maanate hai ki feresids pithogoras kaa sabase antarang shikshak tha
 Pheresidus taught about the soul in the words of Penta Maycos and-; The most likely origins of the Pythagorean use of the pentagram were their use as a symbol of identity among members and as a symbol of internal health
 pai thogoras sangeet main bahut adhik ruchi lete the, atah unke anuyaayi bhi sangeet main ruchi rakhte the
 Pythagoras was a musician and mathematician

 According to legend, Pythagoras discovered that the musical note could be translated into mathematical equations, when he one day passed by a working blacksmith and thought that his anvil resulted from an injury The sound being made was beautiful and harmonious and he determined that whatever scientific rule is the reason for it must be mathematical and can be applied to music

) pithogoras ne sankhya ke siddhant ko vistaarpurvak spasht kiya, jiskaa sahi arth aaj bhi vidwaanon ke bich bahes kaa vishay bana hua he
 Pythagoras believed in the "spontaneity of the balls", believing that planets and stars move according to mathematical equations, with some similarities found in musical tones and producing a melodious melody
 saanchaa:academia From the fourth century A
D
, Pythagoras is credited with discovering Pythagoras's theorem, a theorem in geometry that establishes that the square of the diagonal s in a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides b and A
 arthath a2 + b2 = c2
 Although the theorem, now known by his name, was first used by the Babylonians and Indians
 aksar kaha jaataa he ki unhone yaa unke vidhyaarthiyon ne iske pehle pramaan die
 It must be stressed, however, that the manner in which the Babylonians handled the numbers of Pythagoras suggests that they knew that this theory generally proved to be true and that they also knew of some of the evidences which were hitherto unverified Not discovered in sources
 unke skool kii gupt prakruti kii vajah se or iske vidhyaarthiyon ke dwaara sab kuch apane shikshakon ko arpit kar dene kii vajah se, is baat ke koi pramaan nahin hai ki pithogoras ne is prameya ko sabit karne ke liye is par khud kaam kiya
 For that matter, there is no evidence that he worked on any mathematical or post-mathematical problems
 kuch log maanate hai ki yah pithogoras kii mrityu ke do sadiyon ke baad plato ke anuyaayiyon ke dwaara saavdhaneepurvak nirmit ek myth he
 Primarily to justify the case of Plato's paraphysics, which worked well with the ideas he devoted to Pythagoras
 yah adhyaropan sadiyon se chalaa aa rahaa he or aadhunik samay se bhi juda hua he
 The first reference to Pythagoras's name being associated with this theorem is found in the writings of Cicero and Plutarch five centuries after his death
 aaj pithogoras ko uske anuyaayi greek plato ke saath ahal al tauhid yaa druj vishwaas ke dwaara ek bhakt ke rup main pratishthit kiya jaataa he, lekin pithogoras ke aalochak bhi the, jaise heraclitas jinhone kaha ki "zyada sikh pard lene se buddhi nahin aati he; anyathaa yah hesiod or pithogoras ko or phir se jenophens or hekateyas ko sikhaaya gaya
 Pythagoras had a religious and scientific outlook, in his view science and religion are related to each other
 dharmik rup se pithogoras metempcychosis ke anuyaayi the
 They believed in the relocation or the rebirth of the soul, believing that the soul would incarnate repeatedly in humans, animals, or vegetables until it became virtuous
 unka punarjanm kaa vichaar pracheen unani dharm se prabhavit tha
 He was the first to propose that the thought process and soul are located in the brain and not in the heart
 unhen khud vistaar se chaar jivan yaad the jaisaa ki ve daawa karte the ki unhone jie hai or ve apane mrit mitra ke rone kii aawaaj ko ek kute ke bhunkane ke rup main sunate the
 One belief of Pythagoras was that the essence of life is number
 is prakaar se, sabhi chizon kii sthirataa brahmand ko banaati he
 Things like health depend on a constant proportion of the elements; Too little or too much of anything causes an imbalance that can make any organism unhealthy
 ve vichaaron kii tulana sankhya kii gananaaon se karte the
 When philosophy joins folk principles, it becomes a belief that knowledge of the essence of life can be discovered in the form of numbers
 yadi ise ek kadam aage le jaaya jaye kaha ja saktaa he ki kyonki ganit ek andekha saar he, jivan kaa saar ek andekha lakshan he jiskaa ganit ke adhyayan ke dwaara saamana kiya ja saktaa he
 None of the writings of Pythagoras are found, although some forged writings are associated with his name, and these are presently also found; These have been transmitted in antiquity
 jatil pracheen strot jaise arestu or aristogens in lekhanon par andeh prastut karte hai
 The ancient Pythagoreans usually explained their master's phrases with the idiom autos aphe and emphasized the fundamentally oral nature of their teaching
 pithogoras ovid ke metamorfocess kii aakhri kitaab ke charitra ke rup main, jahaan ovid ne uske darshanik drushtikon par vyakhya kii he
 Pythagoras is quoted as saying, "no man is free who cannot control himself
 " Pythagoras also has another side, in which he became a subject of elaborate legends surrounding his historical personality
 arestu ne pithogoras ko ek alokik vyakti ke rup main varnit kiya he jo aashcharya janak kaary karata he, unhen ek golden thai ke rup main aise pahalu ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he, jo devatv kii nishaani he
 According to Aristotle and others, some ancient people believed that they had the ability to travel through space and time, and to talk with animals and plants
 bruers dictionari of fres and feble kii pravishti se ek uddhran he "golden thai" It was said that Pythagoras had a Golden Thai, which he represented to Iberis, a northwest priest, and performed at the Olympic Games
 ek anya katha jo bryker ke shabdkosh se lee gayi he
 She depicts his description of the moon
 pithogoras ne mana kii vah chandramaa par likh saktaa tha
 His plan was to write on a mirror in blood and put it in front of the moon and when the inscription would reflect on the moon's disk
 pithogoras kii ek mukhya uplabdhi thi ek khoj, ki sangeet 1 se 4 tak sankhyaon ke anupaatik interval par aadhaarit hota he
 He believed that the number system and therefore the cosmos system were based on the sum of these numbers: swearing of Pythagoras by the ten or tetrakatis of the decks rather than the ten deities
 visham sankhyaayein nar the or sam sankhyae maadaa thim
 He discovered the principles of mathematical ratios, constructed from 3 to 5 geometric solids
 uske kram ke ek sadsy hippasus ne an anupaatik sankhya kii bhi khoj kii, lekin yah vichaar pithogoras ke liye sochane yogya nahin tha or puranic katha ke anusaar hippasus ko maar daalaa gaya tha
 Pythagoras or also discovered square numbers
 unhone paaya ki udhaaharan ke liye yadi chaar pathar lekar unhen ek varg ke rup main vyavasthit kar diya jaye, to na keval prayek bhujaa duusari bhujaa ke baraabar hoti he, balki yadi do bhujaaon ko ek duusare se guna kiya jaye to, ve varg kii vyavastha main pattharon kii kul sankhya ke yoga ke baraabar hoti hai
 That is why it is called "square root"
 ve ye sochane vaale pehle vyaktiyon main se ek the, ki prithvi gol he or sabhi grahon kaa ek aksh he or sabhi grah ek kendriya bindu ke chaaron or ghoomte hai
 He stated that this central point is the Earth, but later stated that this central point is "agni" which he never identified as the Sun
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki chaand ek anya grah he jise unhone "counter arth "kaha- baad main unhone simit-aseemit main vishwaas jataayaa
 Pythagoras or in a broader sense the Pythagoreans made a significant impact on Plato's work
 aar em hare ke anusaar unke prabhaav main teen bindu shaamil the: a) platonic ganraajya "ek samaan soch vaale logon ke ek sangathit samudaay " ke vichaaron se sambandhit ho saktaa he, jaisaa ki pithogoras ne crotone main sthapit kiya
 B) There is evidence that Plato may have taken the idea from Pythagoras that mathematics and common language, abstract thinking is a safe basis for philosophical thinking, as well as an adequate thesis in science and ethics
 sa) plato or pithogoras ne "aatma or bhautik duniya main iske sthaan ke liye rahasywaadee drushtikon" main saamaan vichaar prastut kiya
 It seems that both were influenced by orphism
 plato ke vichaar spasht rup se arkitas ke kaam se prabhavit hue, jo teesri peedhee kaa ek vaastavik pithogorian tha, usne jyamiti main mahatvapurn yogadan diya, jo euclid ke tatvonki aathvin pustak main pratibimbit hota he
 In the legends of ancient Rome and Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome studied under Pythagoras, it is said
 isaki sambhaavna nahin he kyonki do jeevon ke liye saamaan rup se sweekrut tareekhen adhyaropit nahin karti hai
 Pythagoras established a secret society called the Pythagorean Brotherhood, which was devoted to the study of mathematics
 iskaa bhavi gupt paramparaon par gaharaa prabhaav padaa, jaise rosicrusienism or freemasenary, ye donon aise samooh ganit ke adhyayan ko samarpit the, donon kaa daawa tha ki ve pithogorian brotherhud se viksit hue hai
 The mysterious and secretive properties of Pythagoras' mathematics are discussed in Menley P's recent chapter The Secret Teachings of All Ages entitled "pythagorean Mathematics"
 pithogoras ke siddhant ne baad main sankhya vigyaan par gaharaa prabhaav daalaa, jo pracheen duniya main puure madhya purv main bahut adhik lokapriy hua
 The 8th-century Muslim alchemist Jabir ibn Hayan worked on the basis of extensive numerology, heavily influenced by the theory of Pythagoras
 pithogoras ke bare main koi praathmik strot nahin bache hai
 This article gives a classical interpretation of Pythagoras based on the writings of later authors
 chunki bahut si jaankaree jo uplabdh he vah pithogoras ke jivan ke sadiyon ke baad likhi gayi, unki sateekta anishchit he
 It is believed that the mathematical significance of the early Pythagoreans is exaggerated and the Pythagoreans were orphic
 unka sankhya vigyaan par prabhaav tha, baad main unamem se hi gambhir ganitagyon kaa janm hua jab jyamiti puure greece main lokapriy ho gayi
