 Samudrabandha, the commentator of "alankarasarvasva", has given a beautiful account of the uniqueness of many sects of this scripture
 kavy ke vibhinn angon par mahatv tathaa bal dene se vibhinn sampradaayon kii vibhinn shatabdiyon main utpatti hui
 The number of main sects can be considered as six- in sampradaayon ne apane naam ke anusaar tattat 'kavy kii aatma' arthath mukhya praan sweekaar kiya he
 The chief Acharya of the Rasa sect is Bharata Muni who mainly analyzed the Natyaras and that description was considered authentic by the Avantar Acharyas also for the Kavyaras
 alankaar sampradaay ke pramukh acharya bhamah, dandi, udbhat tathaa rudrat hai
 In this view, ornamentation is considered to be the soul of poetry
 is shaastra ke itihaas main yahi sampradaay pracheenatam tathaa vyapak prabhaavapurn angeekrut kiya jaataa he
 The chief of the Reeti sect is Acharya Vamana, who in his "kavyalankarsutra" has considered Reeti as the soul of poetry in clear terms
 dandi ne bhi reeti ke ubhay prakaar--vaidarbhi tathaa gaudi--kii apane "kavyadarsh" main badi maarmik samiksha kii thi, parantu unki drushti main kavy main alankaar kii hi pramukhataa rahati he
 The origin of the Vakrokti sect is attributed to Acharya Kuntak, who in his "vakrokhivishiva" has accepted the "vakrokti" as the soul of poetry
 dhwani sampradaay kaa pravatrthan aanandavardhan ne apane ugantarkari granth "dhvanyalok" main kiya tathaa iskaa pratishthapan abhinav gupt ne dhvanyalok kii lochan tikaa main kiya
 Mammat, Ruyak, Hemachandra, Piyushvarsha Jayadeva, Vishwanath Kaviraj, Panditraj Jagannath - are the distinguished masters of this sect
 auchity sampradaay ke pratishthata kshemendra ne bharat, aanandavardhan aadi pracheen aacharyon ke mat ko grahan kar kavy main auchity tatv ko pramukh tatv angikaar kiya tathaa ise swatantra sampradaay ke rup main pratishthit kiya
 The rhetoric has thus been reviewing poetry for almost two thousand years
 yah shaastra atyant pracheen kaal se kavy kii samiksha or kavy kii rachana main aalochakon tathaa kaviyon kaa morganirdesh karata aayaa he
 This renders the poetic analysis both intimate and outmoded
 samikshasansar ke liye alankarishastra kii kavyatatvon kii chaar atyant mahatvapurn dein he jinka sarvang vivechan, antarang pareekshan tathaa vyaavhaarik upyog bhartiya saahitiyik manishiyon ne badi sookshmata se anek granthon main pratipaadit kiya he
 These are important poetic elements - justification, quibble, sound and rasa
 auchity kaa tatv lok vyavhaar main or kavyakala main nitant vyapak siddhant he
 On the basis of justification, the palace of Rasamimamsa stands
 aanandavardhan kii yah ukti samikshajgat main moulik tathy kaa upanyaas karti he ki anauchity ko chhodkar rasbhang kaa koi doosraa kaaran nahin he or auchity kaa upanibandhan ras kaa rahasybhoot upanishat he- Vakrokti Lokatikranta is the literary noun of the configuration of the transitional word
 vakrokti ke mahatmaya se hi koi bhi ukti kavy kii raspecial sookhti ke rup main parinat hoti he
 There is a lot of poetic touchiness to the "expressionism" quibble referred to by Crochet in Europe
 dhwani kaa tatv sanskrit aalochana kii teesri mahati dein he
 Our critics say that poetry does not reveal as much to our ears as it does, but it also has the ability to convey extremely deep meanings to our hearts
 yah sundar manoram arth "vyanjana" naamak ek vishisht shabdavyapaar ke dwaara prakat hota he or is prakaar vyanjak shabdaarth ko dhvanikavy ke naam se pukaarte hai
 Luckily, the vision of Abercrombie and Richards, a recognized critic of English, has just attracted this element
 rastatv kii mimasaa bhartiya aalochakon ke manovaigyanik samikshapaddati ke anushilan kaa manoram fal he
 Poetry is a reflection in the euphoria of supernatural bliss whether it is poetry, audio or visual
 hridayapaksh hi kavy kaa kalapaksh kii apeksha nitant madhutar tathaa shobhan paksh he, is tathy par bhartiya aalochana kaa nitant aagrah he
 Indian criticism is not at all providential in its scrutiny of the problem solving philosophy of life and thus it alone represents the three scriptures of the Western world - "poetics", "retarics" and "aesthetics"
 pracheenta, gambhirtha tathaa manovaigyanik vishleshan main yah pashchimi aalochana se kahin adhik mahatvashaalee he; is vishay main do mat nahin ho sakate

 One of the misconceptions prevalent in Europe was that somewhere in the east, there lived a king named Prester John, who is a Christian and owns immense wealth
 purtagaaliyon ko bharosa tha ki ye raja bharat kaa raja he
 To find out, Portuguese King John sent two detectives on a landward journey to the east
 lekin jerusalem pahunchne ke baad unhen maaloom hua ki arabi siikhe bina aage badhanaa sambhav nahin he - ve laut gaye
 After this, in May 1487, Pero da Covilha and Afonso de Peva were sent on a secret journey
 ve misr main sikandriyaa or kahiraa pahunch gaye
 Pero Aden from them reached Calicut via Red Sea
 vyapaar or margon ko usne nirikshan kiya or kahiraa laut gaya
 There he met two Portuguese Jews who were sent by King John
 jaankariyon kaa aadan pradaan hua or kowilha dakshin kii ore ithiopia chalaa gaya
 He wanted to return from there, but seeing his world knowledge, King Alexander appointed his advisor and promised to send him to Portugal later
 lekin wo jaldi mar gaya or uske bete ne uski ye kaamana puri nahin kii
 Kovilha settled there
 san 1526 ke kisi portugali mishan ne baad main paaya ki kowilha ithiopia main tandoorust, safal or swasth avasthaa main tha - usne vahiin shaadi kar lee or 74 varsh kii aayu main mara
 In August of 1487, the Portuguese king sent a sailor named Bartolomeo Dias to travel to Africa
 wo pehla european navik tha jo dakshintam africa ke tat - uttamasha antareep - ke paar pahunchaa
 But returned after being defeated by a fierce storm
 lekin uske pashchim se purab kii taraf ja sakane se yah sabit ho gaya ki africa kaa dakshini konaa he or duniya yaheen khatm nahin ho jaati
 Meanwhile, King Manuel proposed the idea of a four-boat crew to India
 is dal kaa captain gamma ko chunaa gaya
 Many were astonished by this - because Gama did not experience any major maritime challenge other than the battles around
 lekin anushaasit or raja ke vishwast hone ke kaaran use niyukt kar liya gaya
 On 8 July 1497, four ships left Lisbon and began their first voyage to India
 lagbhag 170 logon ke is bede ke anya mahatvapurn naamon main martim aphonso or farnaao martins kaa naam tha
 Afonso had lived in the Congo and knew African dialects, while Fernao was an imprisonment in Morocco due to his imprisonment
 das se baarah abhiyukt bhi is jahaji bede main raja dwaara rakhe gaye the jinako khataranaak sthalon par jaankaree or khoji kaamon ko puraa karne kaa kaam diya gaya tha
 As expected, there were no women aboard the ship
 chalane ke ek saptaah baad, 15 july ko wo kenneri tak pahunche or uske baad chhaae dhundh kii vajah se jahaaj alag ho gaye
 They were scheduled to meet in Cape Verde, but Paolo de Gama did not see any other ship there
 halanki berio or bhandaaran jahaaj kuch ghanto ke bheetar aa gaye
 Gamma's ship was not found for the next four days
 milane ke baad wo vahaan ek saptaah tak ruke or phir 3 agast ko ravaanaa hue
 In all the Portuguese voyages so far, sailors' ships had passed through the Nicach off the coast of Africa - also to Bartelomeo Dias
 lekin ek tufaani hawa, jo khule atlantic main bahati he navikon ko uttamasha antareep tak teji se dhakel detii he -aisa vasco da gamma ne sun rakhaa tha
 Instead of turning east, his own sailors were told to walk south in the open sea instead of walking in Africa
 kai dinon tak khule samudr main chalane or koi jameen yaa aashaa na dekhne ke baad 1 navambar wo jameen ke nikat aae
 It must have been some 150 kilometers before Uttamaha
 logon main khushi kii lahar daud gai
 After restoring the ship and seeing its maps, people rested
 jahaaj par maujuud vrittantkaar ne likhaa ki logon kii chamadi kaa rang bhura he, ve sil, whale yaa hiran kaa maance or vanaspati kii jadi khate he
 They wear leather garments and dogs always walk with them
 vahaan se wo 16 navambar ko chale
 The Bulkul coast line did not match the map of Bertlemeo Dias, but the bay continued to move and reached Uttamaasha Antip on 22 November
 vahaan par dias dwaara sthaneey logon ke saath hue jhadpon kii khabar unhen mil chuki thi, lekin unke saath bhi vahaan par jhadap ho gai
 After repairing the ships, he left from there on 7 December
 16 disambar ko wo us nadi ke muhane par pahunche jahaan se bartelomeu dias ke navikon ne use waapas jane par majaboor kiya tha
 He saw a cross installed by Dias there
 iske baad ke raaston par aaj tak koi nahin pahunchaa tha - isliye pehle se bane maanchitr bekaar ho gaye or unhen nayaa maanchitr bananaa padaa
 They moved north along the coast
 chunki vah christmas ke aasapaas kaa samay tha, da gamma ke karmidal ne ek tat kaa naam, jisase hokar ve guzar rahe the, "nataal" rakhaa
 It means "christmas" in Portuguese and the name of that place is still in use till date
 janvari tak ve log aaj ke mozambik tak pahunch gaye the, jo purvi africa kaa ek tateey kshetra he jisapar arab logon ne hind mahaasaagar ke vyapaar network ke ek bhaag ke rup main niyantran kar rakhaa tha
 They were chased by an angry mob who came to know that they are not Muslims and they proceeded to Kenya
 kenya ke mombasa main bhi uskaa virodh hua
 After arriving, he was told that there are many Christians living in the city of Mombasa
 jahaaj ko tat se dur rakhane ke baad kuch navik shahar ke daure par gaye jahaan unhen gore isaiyon se mulaakaat hui
 Later it was learned that after receiving news from Mozambique, the Sultan there had prepared a plan to trap him
 gamma vahaan se bhaag niklaa - par use bharat pahunchne ke liye dishaao ke jaankaar navikon yaa nideshkon kii zarurat thi
 He caught four people coming on a small boat
 ek buudhe musalmaan vyapaaree ne bataaya ki paas ke tat malindi main bhartiya navik rahete hai
 Vasco reached Malindi seeing no choice
 bharatiyon ko deshkar use laga ki ye isai he - krishna ke uccharan ko wo christ samaj rahe the
 In Malindi, The Gama hired an Indian guide, who led the Portuguese on the forward route and brought them to Calicut, Kerala, on 20 May 1498, which is located on the southwest coast of India
 vahaan ke raja ne unhen kalikat ke pattan par aane kaa nyauta diya lekin gamma ke raah main itani baadhaayen ain thim ki use laga ki ye bhi dushman hi honge
 But he met Vali to meet and then Zamorin welcomed Gamma to Calicut with music
 vahaan par raaj-darbar main aane se pehle use ek mandir mila jahaan andar main use ek devi kii murti mila
 The Portuguese felt that this was a statue of Mary and she was convinced that Zamorin was a Christian ruler
 wo murti shaayad mariammaa devi kii thi jise wo isamsih kii maan mariyam samaj rahe the
 The comedian who was included in the group with Gamma who was welcomed by Jamorin wrote - "the people of this country are brown, short-sighted and at first look jealous and mean
 mard qamar ke upar kuch nahin pahante 
 Some have long hair, while many have shaved heads
 mahilaayein saamanyatya sundar nahin dikhti hai
 "fernão Martins translated Gamma into Arabic meeting Zamorin
 darbar main muslim salaahkaaron ne use vyapaar kii baat karne main kai adchane paidaa kii
 He ridiculed Gama's gift and delayed him to meet the king
 iske alaave uske paas raja ke liye uchit koi uphaar bhi nahin tha
 For this reason he had a fight with Zamorin
 zamorin ke muslim mantriyon ne usase vyapaar kaa kar maanga
 Zamorin also refuses to erect the pillar he had requested
 sulah or phir ladaai chalati rahi
 The king's Muslim ministers kidnapped many people from his entourage
 lekin samudr main unke jahaaj par aae graahakon ko gamma ne bandi bana liya
 Finally he was allowed to leave and in the end of August he left - the king also gave him a citation in Malayalam containing a message to King John of Portugal that Vasco had come here
 lekin agle hi din koi 70 arabi jahaaj vahaan akraman ke liye aate dikhe
 In response, he fired
 kuch bhartiya bandhakon ke saath sitambar 1498 main waapas portugal ke liye laut gaya
 He reached the Swahili coast again in January
 jahaaj par koi 500 din guzar gaye the - log thak or biimaar ho chale the
 While living some 2 weeks away from home on the West African coast, his brother - and captain of one of the crew's three ships, Paulo the Gamma - fell ill and was killed
 usne baaqi jahaajon ko lisbon laut jane kaa aadesh diya or bhai ko dafanaane ke baad apane dal se peeche lisbon pahunchaa
 He received a fierce reception there
 gamma ne waapas aakar apana vrittant raja manuel ko sunaaya
 Contrary to his prejudices, he found the Christians of India different and could not recognize Portugal - which surprised him
 bharat main muslimon kii upasthiti se bhi use duvidha hui
 Seeing the Muslim rule everywhere in Africa and the number of Muslim merchants in the Arabian Sea, he remembered his "christian duty" and sent two more missions within two years
 janvari 1500 isvi kaa samay bahut hi shubhankar laga, par mishan bhejne main 2 maheenon kii deree ho gai
 In March 1500, 13 ships headed by Pedro ारेlvarez Cabral sailed from Lisbon
 unka lakshya africa or bharat main vyapaar ke aadhaar lagane ke alaave jamorin ko muslim vyapaariyon ko bhaga dene kaa aagrah bhi tha
 But many ships were lost in order to go southwest and then east of Gamma's stated approach to reach Uttamaasha
 kaabral kalikat pahunchaa - nae jamorin ne europea jahaajon kaa vyapaar sweekaar kiya or suraksha kaa aashwaasan diya
 But Arab merchants had reached the port for that year
 kebral ne arab jahaaj ko pakad liya - ye kahkar ki ye jamorin ke saath hui vyapaar sandhi kaa ulanghan he
 In response, he killed all 70 people of the Portuguese factory
 lekin kaabral kii yatra purna asafalataa nahin thi - usne aate vaqt sophala or kilva ke raajaaon se sampark sthapit kiya
 He also went to Coonoor in India and some ships that were "lost" - reached South America
 isse pehle ke kabral laut paata, manuel pratham ne hoaao da nova ke netritv main 4 jahaajon ke saath niklaa
 a message left by Kabral was found hanging in an old shoe on the coast of Africa and reached Calicut
 vahaan pahunchakar usne kai muslim jahaajon par akraman kiya
 a factory in Coonoor returned to Lagar, Portugal
 is prakaar portugal ke jahaajon ne agle 20 saalon ke liye usne kalikat ke shaskaon se dushmani mol le lee
 In 1502, Vasco was repatriated
 uski agali yatra 1502 main hui, jab use ye gyaat hua kii kalikat ke logon ne peeche chhot gaye sabhi portugaliyon ko maar daalaa he
 He dismantled all the Indian and Arab ships en route to his voyage and proceeded to control Calicut and seized much wealth
 isse portugal kaa raja usase bahut prasann hua
 He also went to Cochin, Coonoor and Goa
 cochin ke dakshin main use sadiyon se rah rahe isaiyon kaa pataa chalaa
 Gama left some Portuguese there and the ruler of that city also asked him to leave everything he had left there, but he escaped from there
 uski duusari yatra portugali raja ke mishan ke hisaab se bahut safal rahaa kyonki usne arab vyapaariyon ke kadi ladaai kii - jamorin ko vyapaar ke liye majaboor kiya or bharat main rah rahe isaiyon kaa pataa lagaaya
 In 1524, he set out on his last visit to India
 us samay portugal kii bharat main upnivesh basti ke viceroy ke rup main aayaa, par vahaan pahunchne ke kuch samay baad uski mrityu ho gai
 Vasto de Gama was one of the most important ocean explorers after Portuguese prince and explorer Henry
 teen mahadeshon or do mahasaagaron ko paar karne ke baad bhi arab sagar main arab vyapaariyon or africa samrajyon se ladane or phir bharat aakar apane saath laae portugali raaj-sandesh tathaa uski hifaazat ke liye raja se yuddh or safalataa uske drudh-nishchay ko dikhaati he
 Vasco was rewarded as a successful soldier in Portugal upon his return
 apane samakaleen columbus ke mukaable uski lambi yatra main bhi baghaavat nahin hui or thakne ke baad bhi apane lakshya par jame rahaa
 The spice trade of Arab and Moore merchants was greatly hit when Vasco da Gama reached India
 is vyapaar ko hathiyaane ke liye vasco da gamma ne na sirf khatarnaak or parishramee yatra kii, balki kai yuddh bhi ladaa
 With the help of his superior guns, he was successful in most battles
 isse adan -hormuj -kalikat jal-vyapaar maarg tut yaa kamazor pad gaya
 Seeing his success, King Manuel of Portugal undertook many missions in India and the East
 albukark, jo uski tasri yatra se pehle portugal se bheja gaya tha, ne arab sagar main arabon ke vyapaar or saamudrik sena or sampatti ko tahas-nahas kar diya or khoji malaysia or phir china tak pahunch gaye
 By the sixteenth century, broken Arabic became the language of Portuguese trade instead of Arabic
 is samay portugal ek saamudrik shakti ban gaya
 Where he once reached in India is named vasco-di-gama in his honor
 chaand ke ek gadhde kaa or portugal main kai sadakon kaa naam vasco ke naam par rakhaa gaya he
 Originally made in 2011, he is portrayed as a villain in the Malayalam film Urumi, directed by Santosh Shivan
 dholbaja main bharat ke bihar rajya ke antargat purnia mandal ke arriya jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Rabale is an area of navi Mumbai

 Major Dhyanchand Singh was a former player and captain of Indian field hockey
 bharat evam vishwa hockey ke sarvshereshth khilaaddiyon main unki ginati hoti he
 He was a member of the three-time Olympic gold medal winning Indian hockey team
 unki janmatithi ko bharat main "rashtriya khel diwas" ke ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 His younger brother Roop Singh was also a good hockey player who scored many goals in the Olympics
 unhen hockey kaa jaadugar hi kaha jaataa he
 He scored more than 1000 goals in his playing life
 jab wo maidan main khilne ko utarate the to gend maanon unki hockey stick se chipak si jaati thi
 He was awarded the Padma Bhushan, the prestigious civilian honor of India in 1956
 iske alaava bahut se sanghathan or prasiddh log samay-samay par unhe 'bharataratna' se sammanit karne kii maang karte rahe hai kintu ab kendra main bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar hone se unhe yah sammaan pradaan kiye jane kii sambhaavna bahut bad gayi he
 Major Dhyanchand was born on 29 August 1905 in Allahabad
 unke balya-jivan main khiladeepan ke koi vishesh lakshan dikhaai nahin dete the
 Therefore, it can be said that the talent of the game of hockey was not innate, rather he earned this reputation through continuous practice, practice, perseverance, struggle and resolution
 saadhaaran shiksha praapt karne ke baad 16 varsh kii avasthaa main 1922 i
 main dilli main pratham brahman regiment main sena main ek saadhaaran sipaahi kii haisiyat se bharti ho gaye
 At the time, while filling in the 'first Brahmin Regiment', he did not have any special interest or interest in hockey
 dhyanchand ko hockey khilne ke liye prerit karne kaa shrey regiment ke ek soobedaar major tiwari ko he
 Major Tiwari himself was also a lover and sportsman
 unki dekh-rekh main dhyanchand hockey khilne lage dekhte hi dekhte vah duniya ke ek mahaan khilaadi ban gaye
 Lance was made a hero in 1927 AD
 san 1932 i
 main los anjals jane par nayak niyukt hue
 In 1937, when he was the captain of the Indian hockey team, he was made the Subedar
 jab dwitiya mahayuddh prarambh hua to san 1943 i
 main 'leftinent' niyukt hue or bharat ke swatantra hone par san 1948 i
 main captain bana die gaye
 He was promoted in the army only due to the game of hockey
 1938 main unhen 'vysarai kaa kamishan' mila or ve soobedaar ban gaye
 After that, another subedar, lieutenant and captain went on to become one after the other
 baad main unhen major bana diya gaya
 Dhyanchand is considered equivalent to Pelé in football and Bradman in cricket
 gend is kadar unki stick se chipki rahati ki pratidwandvi khilaadi ko aksar ashanka hoti ki vah jaadui stick se khel rahe hai
 Even in Holland, he was seen breaking his stick in fear of having a magnet in his hockey stick
 japan main dhyanchand kii hockey stick se jis tarah gend chipki rahati thi use dekh kar unki hockey stick main gond lage hone kii baat kahi gai
 There are hardly any tales of Dhyanchand's art of hockey that have been heard about any other player in the world
 unki hockey kii kalakaari dekhakar hockey ke mureed to vaah-vaah kah hi uthte the balki pratidwandvi team ke khilaadi bhi apni sudhabudh khokar unki kalakaari ko dekhne main mashgool ho jate the
 Fascinated by his artistry, the stubborn emperor like Rudolf Hitler of Germany offered him to play for Germany
 lekin dhyanchand ne hameshaa bharat ke liye khelnaa hi sabase bada gaurav samajha
 In Vienna, a statue of Dhyanchand carrying four hockey sticks in his four hands was placed and showed how tremendous players Dhyanchand was
 jab ye brahman regiment main the us samay major bale tiwari se, jo haaki ke shaukeen the, haaki kaa pratham paath siikhaa
 From 1922 AD to 1926 AD, hockey was played only in army competitions
 dilli main hui vaarshik pratiyogita main jab inhen saraahaa gaya to inkaa hausala badha
 On 13 May 1926 AD, the first match was played in New Zealand
 newjiland main 21 match khele jinamein 3 test match bhi the
 Out of these 21 matches, 18 were won, 2 matches were drawn and one was lost
 puure maichon main inhone 192 gol banaae
 He got a total of 24 goals

 san 1935 i
 main bhartiya haaki dal ke newjiland ke daure par inke dal ne 49 match khele
 Which won 48 matches and was postponed due to a rain
 antarrashtriya maichon main unhone 400 se adhik gol kiye
 He retired from the first class hockey in April 1949
 1928 main amsterdam olympic khelon main pehali baar bhartiya team ne bhaag liya
 Before playing in Amsterdam, the Indian team played 11 matches in England and Dhyanchand got special success there
 amsterdam main bhartiya team pehle sabhi mukaable jeet gai
 On May 17, 1928 AD, Austria scored 6–0 on May 18, Belgium 9–0 on 18 May, 5–0 on Denmark on 20 May, 6–0 on Switzerland on 22 May and 3–0 in the final match on 26 May
 Defeated 0, were declared champions of hockey around the world and were awarded medals on 29 May
 final main do gol dhyanchand ne kiye
 Dhyanchand was also included in the team in the 1932 Olympic competitions held in Las Angeles
 us samay centre forward ke rup main kaafii safalataa or shoharat praapt kar chuke the
 Then he became a hero after 'lance-nayak' in the army
 is daure ke dauraan bharat ne kaafii match khele
 In this entire journey, Dhyanchand himself scored 101 goals out of 262
 nirnaayak match main bharat ne america ko 24-1 se haraaya tha
 Then a US newspaper wrote that the Indian hockey team was a storm from the east
 usne apane veg se america team ke gyaarah khilaadiyon ko kuchal diya
 Dhyanchand was selected as the captain of the Indian team in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games
 is par unhone aashcharya prakat karte hue kaha- "mujhe zaraa bhi aashaa nahin thi ki main captain chunaa jaaounga" khayr, unhone apane is daayitv ko badi eemaandaaree ke saath nibhaayaa
 Recounting his memorable memoir of his life, he says that on July 17, an exhibition match was organized for our practice with the German team
 yah match berlin main khelaa gaya
 We lost it by one goal instead of four
 is haar se mujhe jo dhakka laga use main apane jite-ji nahin bhula saktaa
 We were all surprised to see the progress of the German team and some of our comrades did not like the food either
 bahut-se saathiyon ko to raat neend nahin ai
 On 5 August, India had their first Olympic match with Hungary, in which the Indian team defeated Hungary by four goals
 duusare match main, jo ki 7 agast ko khelaa gaya, bhartiya team ne japan ko 9-0 se haraaya or uske baad 12 agast ko france ko 10 golon se haraaya
 On 15 August, there was a final match between the Indian and German teams
 yadhyapi yah muqabla 14 agast ko khelaa jane vaala tha par us din itani barish hui ki maidan main pani bhar gaya or khel ko ek din ke liye sthagit kar diya gaya
 During the practice, the German team had defeated India, this thing went home badly in everyone's mind
 phir geele maidan or pratikul paristhitiyon ke kaaran hamaare khilaadi or bhi niraash ho gaye the
 Then the Indian team manager Pankaj Gupta got a tip
 vah khilaadiyon ko dressing room main le gaye or sahasaa unhone tirangaa jhandaa hamaare saamne rakhaa or kaha ki isaki laaj ab tumhaare haath he
 All the players respectfully saluted the tricolor and descended into the field like a brave soldier
 bhartiya khilaadi jamkar khele or german kii team ko 8-1 se haraa diya
 That day, the tricolor was really ashamed
 us samay koun jaanata tha ki 15 agast ko hi bharat kaa swatantrata diwas banegaa
 Dhyanchand made not only German dictator Hitler but also great cricketer Don Bradman his trial with his charismatic hockey
 yah bhi sanyog he ki khel jagat kii in donon mahaan hastiyon kaa janm do din ke andar par padataa he
 The world celebrated the birth anniversary of Bradman on August 27, and on August 29, he is ready to bow to Dhyanchand, which is celebrated as Sports Day in India
 breadman haaki ke jaadugar se umr main teen saal chote the
 The two sports personalities, who are adept at their own fun, met each other only once
 vah 1935 kii baat he jab bhartiya team austrailia or newjiland ke daure par gai thi
 The Indian team was then in Adelaide for a match and Bradman also came there to play the match
 breadman or dhyanchand donon tab ek-duusare se mili the
 Bradman then said after watching a game of hockey wizards that they score goals in the same way as runs in cricket
 yahi nahin breadman ko baad main jab pataa chalaa ki dhyanchand ne is daure main 48 match main kul 201 gol daage to unki tippanee thi, yah kisi hockey khilaadi ne banaae yaa ballebaaj ne
 Dhyanchand also made Hitler his hockey trial a year later in the Berlin Olympics
 us samay sirf hitler hi nahin, germany ke hockey premiyon ke dilodimag par bhi ek hi naam chaaya tha or vah tha dhyanchand
 He was awarded the Padma Bhushan, the prestigious civilian honor of India in 1956
 dhyaan chand ko khel ke kshetra main 1956 main padam bhushan se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 He was born on 29 August 1905 in Allahabad, United Provinces, British India
 unke janmdin ko bharat kaa rashtriya khel diwas ghoshit kiya gaya he
 On this day, the National Awards for outstanding performance in sports are given to Arjuna and Dronacharya Awards
 bhartiya olympic sangh ne dhyanchand ko shatabdi kaa khilaadi ghoshit kiya tha
 At present, Bharat Ratna is also being demanded for Dhyanchand
 bharat ratna ko lekar dhyanchand ke naam par ab bhi vivaad jari he
 Each vertebrate begins its life as a coagulated egg
 sansechan kii kriya andey ke koshikadravya ke bheetar ek shukranu ke pravesh karne se hoti hai
 Only the head of the sperm enters the cytoplasm
 yatharth shukranu kaa sir keval cendrak kaa hi bana hota he, isamen koshikadravya kii maatra bahut hi kam hoti he
 The nucleus of the egg and sperm consolidate from each other
 sanyukt cendrak ke vibhaajan ke saath hi koshikadravya kaa vibhaajan bhi hota rahata he
 Two functions are proved by impregnation
 ek to is kriya se nar or maadaa ke anuvanshik padaarth ekatra hote hai, duusare is kriya se andey kaa uddipan hota he jisase ek sanjtil parantu samanvit vidhi kii ek shrenee aarambh hoti hai, jise bhruneey vikaas kehete hai
 The zygotic segmentation depends on the volume of the yoke
 kam yokwaale yaa yoke rahit andey purnabhajit or yoke ke prachuryavale andey apoornabhajit hote hai
 The eggs of reptiles and birds are filled with yoke and the eggs are full of yoke
 inamen yugmaj vibhaajan kii rekha andey ke koshikadravya-kaay dhrav kii seemaa ke aage nahin pahunchati
 In such animals the blastiderm develops on the yoke
 anfibia main puraa yugmaj vibhajit hota he parantu jantu dhruv kii apeksha wegital pole kii koshikaaye adhik shighrata se vibhajit hoti hai
 Due to repeated division, the zygote results in a cell group called a morula
 dhire-dhire morula ke bheetar taral padaarth se bhari hui ek guha utpann hoti he, jise blastosil or is shrenee main bhrun ko blastula kehete hai
 In Amphioxus, the blastula wall is made up of only one cell level
 is kaaran gastrulation kii vidhi saral hoti he
 The blastula's wall begins to sit inward at a particular place, which is called the innermost
 blastosil guha ke bheetar bhitti ke doobane se utpann guha ke kinare ek duusare ke sameep aane lagate hai
 Thus a hole is formed which is called blastopore
 is nai guha ko, jisamen blastopor khulata he, arcenteron kehete hai
 The blastopore is located on the posterior part of the fetus
 ab donon praathmik jananstar sthapit ho gaye
 The outer layer, made up of small cells, is the ectoderm and the inner layer is the endoderm that forms the arcaton wall
 hypoblast kii koshikaaye epiblast kii koshikaon se adhik badi hoti hai
 Both these types of cells can be identified by gastrulation in the blastula itself
 jantdhruv ke kshetra main sthit koshikaaye aakaar main choti or wegital pole par sthit koshikaaye aakaar main badi hoti hai
 Epiblast is formed from the first class of cells and hypoblast from second
 gastrulation se keval inke parsparik sthaneey sambandh main antar utpann hota he
 In the blastula, the cells of two or three rows above the hypoblast cells are the cells of the neural plate
 ye hi aage chalakar tantrika koshikaaye ban jaati hai
 The notochord is formed by two three-row cells bordering the endogenous cells and adjacent to these endocrine cells
 gastrulation ke pashchaat archetsron kii chat par sthapit koshikaon se notocord banataa he
 The cells between the notochord and endogenous layer form hollow clusters on either side
 yah dhaani mesarderm yaa mesoblast kii he
 The difference of gastrulation in acidine is such that the eggs of these animals are mosaic, that is, the future of each part of the egg is decided before impregnation
 inke koshikadravya sthananusaar bhinn prakaar ke hote hai
 The cytoplasm around the nucleus is granular and brown and a thin layer on the cartex is of granular yellow cytoplasm
 hialine koshikadravya un koshikaon main jaataa he jinka epiblast or neural patt banataa he
 Brown granular cytoplasm goes into endogenous cells and yellow cytoplasm goes into interstitial cells
 mechak main gastrulation isse kuch bhinn rup main hota he
 The upper cells in the frog's blastula are small and black and the bottom is filled with a large yolk and is colorless
 in upree or nichle pradeshon ke bich ek ant:sth pradesh bhi hota he
 The upper cell divides more quickly than the lower cells, as a result these smaller cells slide over the larger cells
 is vidhi ko epiboli kehete hai
 This happens due to increase in the number and size of upper cells
 iske aage atirikt or bhi ek ghatana hoti he
 a groove is formed on the future posterior surface of the bruise
 yah praarambhik avasthaa kaa blastopor he
 Many of the cells in this groove move inward, causing the groove to become deeper and a new cavity is created
 yah guha archetsron he or bhrun ab gastrula kii avasthaa main he
 The embryonic cells within the embryo come from the inner region
 blastula ke bheetar prastut guha, blastosil, in koshikaon ke bheetar pravesh karne se or archetsron ke failaav ke kaaran dabakar aage tathaa neeche kii ore hatane lagati he or ant:sth kshetra ke bheetar pravisht koshikaaye archetsron kii chat banaati hai
 The groove of the blastopore extends right and left
 phir yah gruve donon ore se aakar neeche mil jaataa he or ek vrittakar chhidr kaa rup dhaaran kar letaa he
 Meanwhile, large cells of the lower pole enter the inner part of the embryo
 kintu kuch samay tak in badi koshikaon kaa ek samooh blastopor ke munh main sthit rahata he jise yoke plag kehete hai
 By this time, Balastopol is completely lost

 sarpil gallexi kisi sarpil aakaar vaali gallexi ko kehete hai, jaise kii hamaari apni gallexi, akashganga he
 They consist of a flat rotating arms circle consisting of stars, gas and dust, and in the middle of which there is a thick sphere with thick embossed stars
 iske ird-gird ek kam ghanaa gallexic sehara hota he jisamen taare aksar gol taragucchon main paae jate hai
 In spiral galaxies, there is an abundance of newborn stars in the arms and old stars in the center
 kyonki nae taare adhik garam hote hai isliye bhujaaen centre se zyaada chamakati hai
 In two-thirds of spiral galaxies, the arms do not start from the center, but the form of the center is like a thick pole with a central circle in the middle
 bhujaaen phir is danda se nikalati hai
 Because man is located inside the Milky Way on Earth, we cannot see the circle and arms of the entire galaxy
 2008 tak mana jaataa tha ke akashganga kaa ek gol centre he jis se bhujaayen nikalati hai, lekin ab vaigyanikon kaa yah sochna he ke hamaari akashganga bhi aisi dandi sarpil gallexiyon kii shrenee main aati he
 In English, "spiral galaxy" is called "spiral galaxy"
 hindi ke das sarvshereshth beesvin shatabdi tak ke hindi sahityakaron evam hindi sahitya kii vibhinn vidhaon kii rachanaaon ke sandarbh main shreshth aalochakon dwaara kiye gayi ullekhon-vivechanon par aadhaarit mukhyatah das-das utkrisht sahityakaron yaa phir saahitiyik kritiyon kaa chayan he, jinhen saapeksh rup se shreshthatar mana gaya he
 Selection of various legislative best writers and writings from the long and vast literary field of Hindi can be difficult and controversial; But it is a natural part of the curiosity of every reader
 yahan chayan main vyaktigat ruchi kii apeksha vyapak aalochakeey samaj evam tatsambandhi maanya aalochanatmak lekhan ke aadhaar ko apanaaya gaya he
 It is important to note that the north limit of this selection is only till the twentieth century
 samast chayan se sambaddh aadhaar-saamagree kii bhi soochna de di gayi he
 In many sections, a list of 10 best is also available after the ten best for the correct concept, usually equivalent or immediately after the best
 hindi sahitya ke sarvshereshth aalochakon ke chayan kii ekaadhik koshish pustak-lekhan tathaa patrika ke visheshank rup main bhi aalochakon dwaara ho chuki he
 Dr
 Ramachandra Tiwari first presented his critique of his critical contribution by selecting the best ten critics in his book 'hindi Criticism: Shikhar Ka Interview'
 punah aravind treepathi sampadit 'vartmaan sahitya' ke 'shatabdi aalochana par ekagra' visheshank ke pratham khand main 'hindi aalochana ke navratna' kii suchi tathaa vivechan prastut kiye gayi the
 Acharya Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi was also included in both these studies
 acharya dvivedi kaa aitihaasik yogadan nihsandeh anya kisi shreshth aalochak se kai myne main adhik hi hoga, parantu tatasth drushti se swatantra aalochanatmak lekhan ko dhyaan main rakhane par spasht vidit hota he ki unke bilkul praarambhik daur ke aalochak hone ke kaaran unki koi pustak sahi rup main aalochana yaa saahityetihaas kii bhi shreshth pustak ke rup main gini tak nahin ja sakati he
 In fact, he paved the way for criticism
 dow0 ramchandra tiwari dwaara varnit anya nau aalochakon main se dow0 bachchan singh ke bare main dow0 tiwari kii swayan manyata he ki unke lekhan main navalta tathaa taazgi kaa abhaav he evam praayah ve kisi manyata ke kaaphi samay biit jane par hi us par kalam uthaate hai
 In comparison to him, Dr
 Tiwari has described the specialty of Dr
 Nandkishore Naval etc
 and it is believed that Bachchan Singh ji continued to play the role of scholar-scholar relatively
 atah samgr lekhkeey mahatva ke kaaran ve shreshthatar aalochak ke rup main to maanya hai parantu sarvshereshth das main nahin
 While reviewing the centenary critique issue of 'current Literature', the well-known poet Madan Kashyap wrote that it is hardly possible to include six names Pt Ramchandra Shukla, Acharya Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, Muktibodh, Dr Ram Vilas Sharma, Dr Namwar Singh and Vijaydev Narayan Sahi Have a dispute



 parantu acharya nandadulaare vaajapeyi hai to dow0 nagendra kyon nahin? is visheshank main 'navratna' main agyeya ko bhi chun liya gaya tha
 In this context, Madan Kashyap ji clearly states that the creative personality of the unknowable is undoubtedly very large and capable of being included in any selection of the century
 lekin ek kavi-aalochak ke rup main unhen muktibodh or saahi ke saath nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 His critical writing is not as well-organized
 unki jagah par nalin vilochan sharma athwa beeti sadi ke antim teen dashakon kii rachanashiltaa se jude aalochakon dow0 parmanand shrivastav, dow0 manager pandeya aadi main se kisi ko chunaa janaa chahie tha
 It is important to note that Nalinji's writing is disorganized and much unpublished
 naveen evam sudrudh vichaar tathaa vyavasthit lekhan kii drushti se manager pandeya sarvshereshth das main sthaan paane ke liye adhik sakasham vyaktitv siddh hote hai
 Overall, the list of the top ten critics from the conclusion obtained by mutual reference to the aforesaid selection is as follows: - hindi upanyaas ke kshetra main paanch upanyaason ko praayah nirvivaad rup se kaaljayi upanyaas ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he
 According to Dr
 Namwar Singh: chhathvaan naam unhone jor dekar 'naukar kii kameez' kaa liya he
 'banabhatta's autobiography' has been omitted from the name 'mitro Marjani' in the list of ten novels of the century in 'saha Baron of Katha Sahitya', while in the same sequence 'biography of Banabhatta' Includes discussion of 'mitro marajaani' kaa prakaashan or vivechan bhi kahani ke rup main hi hote rahaa he tathaa swayan isaki lekhika ne iske upanyaas rup main sammilit kiye jane par aapatti prakat kii thi
 So here it is included in the stories rather than in the novels
 katha-sahitya ke sau baras - san0 vibhuti narayan raay, shilpyan,shahdara,dilli Instead of the ten best plays, playwrights have been chosen here; Because it has been difficult for any critic to tell which is the best drama of many undisputed best playwrights too
 udhaaharan ke liye prasad ji kaa naatak skandagupt samgr drushti se shreshth he yaa chandragupta ? yahi baat mohan rakesh, surendra verma aadi ke saath bhi lagu he
 Yes, the list of top works in front of the playwrights' name is based on the best critical writing, not empirical
 yahan pratham,tritiy tathaa chaturth naam aitihaasik mahatva kii drushti se he
 The remaining names are in order of overall importance
 lekhak ke naam ke aage unki sheersh kritiyon ke naam hai
 Then names of notable works have also been given for special study
 mahakavyon ke chayan main praayah vivaad kii gunjaaish nahin he, kyonki hindi kii samrudh aalochana-parampara mahakavyon ko itani kadi kasautiyon par kasati rahi he ki aadhunik kaal main, khaskar swatantrayottar kaal main, hindi main kaaphi achche kavi bhi praayah mahakavy likhane kaa saahas tak nahin kar pate
 It is this terror of Hindi criticism that when a poet like Dinkar ji made up his mind to write an epic, he wrote 'poetic drama' by not writing 'epic' in terms of form; So that we can avoid unnecessary expansion and also get rid of many designed attacks
 pehle bhi kai kaviyon ne jo mahakavy likhe unhen uttam kavy main kabhi nahin gina gaya
 Therefore, the number of excellent epics in Hindi has remained within ten
 haan yah avashya he ki ye mahakavy vishwa-vaanmay kii amuly nidhi hai
 Here, according to the belief of Acharya Shukla and Hindi Sahityakosh, Part-2, the number of ten is being completed by adding 'noor Jahan'
 hindi ke kaaphi shreshth kahanikaron kii ek samrudh shrunkhlaa maujuud he
 In the case of storytellers only ten are selected and injustice is done to others with justice
 saath hi usamen purvaagrah prabal ho jaataa he, kyonki hindi main kahani-samiksha purvapar vyapti kii drushti se ab tak paryaapt samrudh nahin he
 Therefore, the history has been divided into three chronicles and the best has been selected

 For this reason people first came in contact with the residents of this province, so they named the whole country as 'persis', due to which nowadays in European languages, Iran got the name Persia, Perce, Presian etc
 farsi bhashaa kaa sambandh bhashaaon ke arya parivaar se he, jisase sanskrit, unani, latin, angreji, french, german aadi bhi sambhddha hai
 The original form of the word 'iran' was "aryana", as the Yavan authors write
 aryaana se dhire-dhire iran shabd ban gaya
 Yavana writers have used the term Aryana for both modern Iran and Afghanistan
 farsi, arya bhashaaon kii purvi shakhaon se sambandh rakhti he
 Its oldest specimens are found in the saga of Avesta, the religious book of the Zoroastrians
 usase kuch kam pracheen bhashaa vah he jo iran ke samraaton dwaara pahaado, chattaanon par khudaae hue lekhon main milti he

 Independent or simultaneous control of the temperature, humidity, wind speed and atmosphere level of a certain area or orbit is called air conditioning
 vaataanukoolit kshetra ke taap, ardrata, vaayu kii gati tathaa vayumandal ke str main vibhinn karkon kaa niyantran aavashyaktaanusaar vibhinn staron par kiya jaataa he
 Generally; The purpose of air conditioning is to provide physical pleasure and industrial comfort
 shaareerik sukh ke liye ooshmaa-sambandhi upyukt evam sukhprad paristhitiyon ko utpann karne main kaksh ke taap, ardrata, vaayu kii gati evam vayumandal ke str ko sharirkriya vigyaan kii drushti se nishchit simaaon ke bheetar niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 When air conditioning is used for industrial purposes, such as for the protection of various stored materials, in the production of textiles and cotton and synthetic fibers, or in printing, the process and industrial requirements at the time determined the above air conditioning factors
 goes
 saamaanya rup main kisi vyaktivishesh ke liye vayumandal evam vaataavaran kaa taap, ardrata, vaayu kii gati evam vayumandal kaa str sharir ke sukh tathaa suvidha kii drushti se sadaa anukool athwa sukhprad nahin hota
 To make these factors pleasing, air conditioning plants have received special publicity in the modern era
 vaataanukoolit vaataavaran manushya ke liye keval sukhprad hi nahin hota, varan uski kaaryakshmata main vruddhi karanevaala bhi hota he
 Heat is produced in human body through various metabolic activities and through manual labor and heat is released into the atmosphere and atmosphere by the body
 sharirkriya vigyaan kii drushti se yadi sharir main ooshmaa kaa utpaadan tathaa sharir dwaara ooshmaa ke nishkasana kii gati samaan hoti he, to yah dasha, manushya ke liye sukhprad hoti he
 The main purpose of air conditioning is to control all those factors in the atmosphere and atmosphere in such a way that the heat production in the body and the speed of heat removal through it are often equal
 manushya ke liye shaareerik drushti se sukhprad vaataavaran kaa taap 21rou-24rou sein
 tathaa saapeksh ardrata 50 pratishat honi chahie
 Similarly, the speed of air from 15 to 25 feet per minute is pleasing to the body
 vaataanukoolan ke uparyukt karkon ko sabhi rituon main samaan str par rakhane par adhiktam sukh praapt nahin hota
 The above mentioned temperature is more than 24 c in summer
 vaataanukoolan karanevaale sanyantron main saamanyat: ek vayushitak tathaa ek vayutapak sanyantr hota he
 The ventilation plant increases the temperature of the air by heating when it is below a certain point, and the ventilator plant brings the air to a level determined by the action of cooling when the temperature is high
 vayushitak yantra sampeedan prakaar kaa yantric prashithan ekak hota he
 Its mechanical compressive system adsorption plant consists of condensing, expander and evaporator
 vaataanukoolan sanyantron main bahya vayumandal kii vaayu channe ke dwaara bheetar pravesh karti hai
 Due to this filter, air dust particles etc
 do not enter inside the plant
 yantric prasheetak main vayuchanne kaa pramukh kaary vaayu ke saath pravesh karne vaale thos kanon kii maatra ko kam karnaa hota he, parantu is kriya main pravesh ke dabaav tathaa nishkasana dabaav main dabaav kaa hraas nunatam hona chahie
 The loss of pressure results in more electricity being used in ventilation
 vayuchanne kii kriyasheeltaa sambandhi kshamta vaayu ke saath pravesh karanevaale kanon ke aakaar par tathaa vaayu main kanon kii sandratha evam vaayu ke pravesh kii gati par nirbhar karti he
 In this way, the filtered air is cooled to a predetermined temperature in a mechanical cooler or in a absorbent cooler
 saamanyat: vaayu ko sheethal karne main samvedi-ooshmaa, athwa aantarik ooshmaa kii urja kaa, garam vaayu se apekshaakrit kam tapawale str, athwa madhyam, main pratyaksh sanvahan dwaara sthanantaaran hota he
 This transfer of heat is caused by the mixing of liquid vapor from the evaporation layer to the flow of the cooled fluid, or evaporation at low pressure
 vayushitalan kii is paddati main dravvashp kaa sammishran sheethal drav athwa vaashp drav main parivartit hote hue vaayu kii ooshmaa ko grahan karata he
 In another method of heat transfer, the heat transfer of the entering air occurs in any wet layered air cooler
 is paddati ko vaayu kaa ardrashitalan kaha jaataa he
 In both of the above mentioned methods of air cooling, the accumulated internal kinetic energy of the air is accumulated by discarding the air, reaching the heat-level, or increasing the internal kinetic energy of the heat-level, thereby increasing the level The temperature is increased or stored as internal state energy in the steady heat evaporation process
 vaataanukoolan main vaayu ko sheethal karne main jab ooshmaa sthanantaran ke liye shushk str kaa upyog hota he, to gupt ooshmaa main parivartan nahin hota tathaa is pravastha main samvedi ooshmaa kii haani sampurna ooshmaa kii haani ke baraabar hoti he
 As the heat of the transfer level of the heat decreases, and it starts approaching the dew point at the specified humidity, the loss of sensory heat begins to increase
 vaataanukoolan kii adrr-shithan reeti main ooshmaa-sthanantaran-str ke taap kaa is prakaar se niyantran hota he ki samvedi ooshmaa kii haani tathaa sampurna ooshmaa kii haani kaa anupaat vaayu-anukulan-adhishthapan kii aavashyak bhaar-paristhiti ko vahan kar sake
 If heat transfer-level heat reaches below the dew point, under conditions of specified humidity, the total heat loss in that phase increases, as well as a decrease in the ratio of sensory heat loss and total heat loss Is generated
 vaataanukoolan sanyantr main yantric sampeedan vyavastha se, ooshmaa urja ke vidyut-sthanantaran main shakti kaa prayog ucch taap kii vaayu se kam taap vaale ooshmaa sthanantaran str main uparyukt reeti se hota he
 The method of heat absorption uses condensation, expansion factor and evaporator of the mechanical compression method, but increases the efficiency of the device by increasing the saturated pressure of the airflow fluid
 vaataanukoolan kii is reeti main gaun avasorak drav kaa prayog hota he
 When in vapor form, this fluid has an affinity for the cooling fluid of the air conditioner
 jal ammonia avasorana paddati main drav rup main jal kaa upyog ammonia ke vaashp ke avasorana ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The cold and concentrated ammonia solution obtained in this way undergoes re-evaporation by bringing it under high pressure and increasing the temperature
 vaataanukoolan sanyantr main shitalk yantra ke atirikt taapak yantra bhi laga hua hota he
 When the heat of the entering air is lowered, the electronic operating system is automatically driven, allowing the heater to work and the temperature of the air coming out of the air conditioning plant to a specified limit
 is prakaar se shitalk tathaa taapak yantron ke sanyuktikaran dwaara kisi kaksh athwa kshetra ke taap ko purvanirdhaarit seemaa par sthir rakhane ke liye yah aavashyak hota he ki vaataanukoolan sanyantr main kaksh kii vaayu kaa santat parivahan hota rahe
 Therefore, there is such a system in the plant that the air of the chamber is suctioned and at cooling or certain temperature this air, or the air of the external atmosphere, flows in a slow motion from the plant to the chamber
 isse kaksh ke taap ke niyantran ke saath saath vaayu main carbon dioxide kii maatra adhik nahin hone paati tathaa kaksh kii vaayu main yadi koi durgandh ho, to uskaa bhi nishkasana hota rahata he
 The control of heat is the most important in air conditioning
 sanyantr main pravesh karanevaali vaayu ko adrr str se hokar jane se jal ke vaashpan kaa niyantran hota he tathaa iske falswaroop kaksh kii ardrata kaa bhi uchit str par niyantran hota he
 In this way, the temperature, humidity, wind speed and atmosphere level of a room or area are controlled separately and jointly at certain levels
 is prakaar ke kaksh ko vaataanukoolit kaha jaataa he
 In this process of air conditioning, the above mentioned factors of atmosphere and atmosphere are adapted to air conditioning for physical pleasure and industrial needs

 sandhivaarta us baatcheet ko kehete hai jiskaa uddeshy vivaadon ko hal karnaa, vibhinn kriyaaon kii disha par sahmati paidaa karnaa, kisi ek vyakti athwa samuhik laabh ke liye sauda karnaa, yaa vibhinn hiton ko tusht karne ke liye parinaamon ko tarashna he
 This is the primary method of alternative dispute resolution
 samjhauta vaarta, vyapaar, labharahit sanghathanon, sarkari shakhaon, kanoonee kaarywahiyon, deshon ke bich or vyaktigat paristhitiyon jaise vivaah, talaak, bacchon kii parvarish or rosemara kii jindagi main hoti hai
 The study of this subject is called the principle of negotiation
 peshewar vaartakar aksar visheshgy hote hai, jaise ki sangh ke vaartakar, uttolan kharid vaartakar, shanti vaartakar, bandhak vaartakar, yaa ve anya kisi padnaam ke antargat bhi kaam kar sakate hai, jaise rajanyik, vidhayak yaa dalal
 The English word "negociation" is derived from the Latin expression, "negotiatus", which is the past participle of negotiare meaning "to carry on the business"
 "negotium" literally means "no leisure"
 samjhauta vaarta, aam taur par ek vishesh sanghathan yaa sthiti kii ore se kaary kar rahe prashikshit vaartakar ke saath khud ko prakat karti he
 This can be compared with arbitration where a neutral third party listens to the arguments of both parties and tries to help in reaching an agreement between the two parties
 iskaa sambandh panchayat se bhi he, jaisaa ki ek kanoonee kaarywahi main hota he, donon paksh apane "maamle" ke gunon ke liye tark rakhte hai or uske baad ek panch donon dalon ke liye parinaam kaa faisla karata he
 In order to develop a better understanding of the essential parts of the negotiation, there are several different ways to divide it
 samjhauta vaarta ke ek nazariye main teen buniyadi tatva shaamil hai: prakriya, vyavhaar or padaarth 
 prakriya kaa sandarbh is baat se he ki dal kaise samjhauta vaarta karte hai: vaartaon kaa prasang, vaartaon main dal, dalon dwaara prayukt ranneeti or anukram or charan jinamein ye sabhi faleebhoot honge
 vyavhaar, in dalon ke bich sambandhon, unke bich samvaad or unke dwaara apanaai jane vaali shaileyon ko darshata he
 Substance refers to what these parties negotiate for: the agenda, the issues, the options, and the agreement that is finally reached
 samjhauta vaarta ke ek anya nazariye main 4 tatva shaamil hai: ranneeti, prakriya or upkaran or yukti 
 ranneeti main sheersh str ke lakshya shaamil hote hai - aam taur par jisamen shaamil hote hai rishte or antim parinaam
 prakriyaaon or upkarnon main shaamil hai uthaae jane vaale kadam or duusare dalon ke saath vaarta kii taiyaari or vaarta ke dauraan, donon main apanaai jane vaali bhoomikaayen
 yukti main shaamil hai adhik vistrut bayaan or kaary or dusron ke bayanon or karrwai ke liye di gai pratikriyaayein
 kuch log isamen anunay or prabhaav ko jodate hai, unka kahana he ki aadhunik samay kii samjhauta vaarta kii safalataa ke liye ye abhinn ban gaye hai or isliye inhen choda nahin janaa chahie
 Skilled negotiators can use a wide variety of tactics, the wide range of which can range from negotiation hypnosis to presenting demands in a straight-forward manner or under a more deceptive approach, such as cherry picking, setting the preconditions
 
 samjhauta vaarta ke parinaamon ko modane main, dhamkee or salaami yukti bhi ek bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 Another compromise negotiation tactic is the bad guy / good guy
 bura aadmi / acha aadmi yukti tab hoti he, jab ek vaartakar bure aadmi ke rup main gusse or dhamkee kaa upyog karata he
 The second negotiator acts like a good man, thoughtful and sensible
 acha aadmi, apane virdohi se riyaayat or samjhauta paane kii koshish main bure aadmi ko har kathinaaiyon ke liye dosha detaa he
 In the advocacy approach, a skilled negotiator typically acts as a party advocate in settlement negotiations and seeks to achieve the most favorable possible outcomes for that party
 is prakriya main vaartakar, us nunatam parinaam ko nirdhaarit karne kaa prayaas karata he jise doosraa dal sweekaar karne ko taiyaar he or phir unki maangon ko tadnusaar samyojit karata he
 In the advocacy approach, a successful settlement negotiation is considered when the negotiator is able to achieve all or most of the outcomes desired by the unanimous party, without provoking the other party to break up the settlement negotiations, as long as the negotiation The best option may not be acceptable
 paaramparik samjhauta vaarta ko, ek tay "pai" kii dharna kii vajah se kabhi-kabhi jito-haaro kaha jaataa he, yani ki ek vyakti kaa laabh duusare vyakti kii haani main parinat hota he
 This is true only when only one issue needs to be resolved, such as price in a simple sale agreement negotiation
 1960 ke dashak ke dauraan, jerard ai
 nirenberg ne vyaktigat, vyapaarik or antarrashtriya sambandhon main vivaadon ko hal karne main samjhauta vaarta kii bhoomika ko pahachaanaa
 unhone da art of nigoceating prakashit kii, jisamen unhone kaha he ki vaartakaron kaa darshan yah tay karata he ki vaarta koun-sa rukh legi
 unka avribody vins darshan, yah bharosa dilaataa he ki samjhauta vaarta kii prakriya se sabhi dal labhanvit hote hai, jo "vijeta sab kuch le letaa he" ke virodhpurna drushtikon kii tulana main kahin adhik safal parinaamon ko utpann karata he
 Getting to Yes was published by Roger Fisher and William Ury as part of the Harvard Dialogue Project
 is pustak kaa drushtikon, jise saidhantik vaarta ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he, use kabhi-kabhi aapasi laabh saudebaaji bhi kaha jaataa he
 The mutual benefit approach has been effectively applied in environmental situations as well as in labor relations where the parties format the settlement negotiations as "problem solving"
 yadi kai muddon par charchaa hoti he, to dalon kii variyataon main bhinnata, "sabaki jai-jai" samjhauta vaarta ko sambhav banaati he
 For example, in a labor agreement negotiation, labor unions may prefer livelihood security over salary increases
 agar niyokta kii vipareet variyatayen hai, to ek saude kii sambhaavna hoti he jo donon dalon ke liye phydemand ho
 isliye aisi samjhauta vaarta ek virdohi shunya-laabh khel nahin he
 The theoretical compromise negotiation method is made up of four main steps: separating people from the problem, focusing on interests, not positions, generating various possibilities before deciding to do something and emphasizing that the outcome is based on the objective standard Be based aise kai or vidwaan hai jinhone samjhauta vaarta ke kshetra main yogadan diya he, jinamein shaamil hai UC barkale main holi shrouth or timothy deonote, tulane vishvavidhyalay main jerard i
 vatzke, jorge mesun vishvavidhyalay main sara kaub, mizori vishvavidhyalay main len reskin, harvard main harvard rifa, MIT main robert mekarsi or laurence saskind or da flechar skool of lau and diplomasi main adil najam or jeswald salakus
 Perhaps the most famous parable of the settlement negotiations involves a discussion on orange
 sabase spasht drushtikon tha use aadha kaatna or prayek vyakti ko uskaa uchit hissaa mil jaataa
 lekin, jab vaartakaron ne ek duusare se apane hiton ko lekar baatcheet kerani shuru kii, to samasya kaa ek behatar samaadhaan spasht ho gaya
 The person willing to have orange juice for his breakfast took that part and the person wanting to make the jam took the skinned portion
 donon pakshon ko ant main adhik hi mila
 donon main se koi samjhauta vishesh rup se rachanaatmak nahin he
 The parable of the orange would become a story of creativity when the two sides decided to cooperate in planting an orange tree or a garden
 Similarly, Boeing buys composite plastic shells for its new 787 Dreamliner, designed and built by Japanese suppliers, and then sells the completed 787 back to Japanese airlines with good subsidies provided by the Japanese government
 yahi he vaarta main rachanaatmakataa kaa matlab
aajkal bijnes skulon main rachanaatmak prakriyaaon ke bare main kaaphi kuch siikhaa ja rahaa he
 Courses are being offered and research essays are proposed in academic conferences and corporate boardrooms making "innovation" a popular word
 or, navachaar or rachanaatmak prakriyaaon ke bare main jitna hi adhik suna jaataa he utana hi adhik ise saraahna milti he or jise samjhauta vaarta kaa japani drushtikon, swaabhaavik rup se, un tamaam takneekon kaa upyog karata he jis par, saamanytah rachanaatmak prakriya kii kisi bhi vaarta main bal diya jaataa he
 Of course, a deep basic explanation is provided for the fact that, despite the scarcity of natural resources and the state of relatively isolation, why the Japanese could build such a successful society
 Although in Japanese society too, there are undoubtedly some obstacles in the way of creativity - hierarchy and collectivism are two - however they have developed a style of negotiation that in many ways eradicates such unnecessary adversity
 vastav main, vaishvik vaarta ke liye harnandes or graham dwaara samarthit das nae niyam, us drushtikon se bhalee prakaar se mail khate hai jo japaniyon main swaabhaavik rup se dekhe jate hai: In addition to the practices of the Japanese people, credit should also be given to celebrities who have always advocated creativity in negotiation negotiations
 harvard rifa or unke sahyogiyon kii salaah he:


 tiimon ko ek saath anaupchaarik rup se sochna or yojana banani chahie or sanyukt rup se dimag ladaana chahie, jise "samvaad" yaa "purvacharchaa" samajha ja saktaa he
 There will be no coordination, commitment, or reasoning on how the two sides will split the pie at this early stage
 Roger Fisher and William Ury titled their fourth chapter in Getting to Yes, "inventing Options for Mutual Gains"
 David Lacks and James Sebenius, in their important new book 3d-negotiations, transcend Gating to Yes and discuss "creative agreement" and "great agreement"

 "saude karnaa" or "samasyaon ko sulajhane" kii baat karte hue yah kshetra aam taur par abhi bhi ateet main atak sa gaya he
 Even the use of words like "win-win" represents only a remnant of old competitive thinking
 mudda yah he ki ek vaarta koi aisi chiz nahin he jise jeeta yaa haara ja saktaa he or pratispardhaatmak roopak rachanaatmakataa ko pratibandhit karata he
 The problem-solving metaphor also does the same
 is prakaar, samjhauta vaarta kaa pehla niyam he: keval rachanaatmak parinaam sweekaaren!newport bich kii kansalting form, idiaworks kii linda laurence, ne vaartaon ke dauraan or adhik vichaaron ko utpann karne ke liye, tareekon kii ek sarvaadhik upyogi suchi viksit kii he: For Japanese readers, a lot of it will be familiar
 It is easy to bring Japanese into physical proximity, they have been living the same way for millennia
 japani companiyon main itane vipanan visheshgy nahin hai jo ejiniyaron se alag hai or jo vitt vishleshkon se alag hai
 Each manager may have worked in a number of functional areas, limiting the "chimney effect" that is often associated with US firms in disparate accents
 shaareerik harakat - theth japani kaarkaane main din kii shuruyaat ko chitrit karti he
 The Japanese, it seems, work best in small groups
 chuppi nishchit rup se thik he 
 japaniyon ne karaoke kaa avishkaar kiya 
 dusron kii aalochana karnaa japaniyon ke liye mushkil he, vishesh rup se videshiyon kii 
 drishyon kaa upyog or samgr soch, japaniyon main swaabhaavik rup se hoti he 
 antaraal bhi japaniyon ke liye ek aam prakriya he 
 japani, un logon ke saath behatar kaam karenge jisase ve parichit hai 
 It should also be noted that some of these techniques will seem foreign to Japanese negotiators
 For example, diversity is not a strong companion for the Japanese - it would seem strange to purposefully add women and other elements of diversity to their groups
 However, there are two major things that Japanese people do in settlement negotiations that others can and should learn: First, the Japanese on this planet are champions of information emptiness
 ve apana munh band rakhte hai or baaki har kisi ko baat karne dete hai
 Thus, compared to any other society, they largely use the diversity of their international peers
 nakal or udhaar lene ke rup main aksar isaki aalochana kii jaati he, lekin sabhi ke vichaaron ke liye khulaa rahanaa vastav main hameshaa se rachanaatmakataa or maanav pragati ke liye mahatvapurn rahaa he
 Although the Japanese, like the rest of the world, are race-centric, they still respect foreign ideas very highly
 doosraa, japani keval dolphin ke saath kaam karenge, jab unke paas vikalp ho to
 vishwaas or rachanaatmakataa, sahagaami hai
 And, they train their foreign counterparts to behave in a more cooperative manner so that they can do well
 Consider the 25-year joint venture between Toyota and General Motors to manufacture small cars in Fremont, CA as a prime example
 rachanaatmakataa ke siddhanton kaa anupaalan vaarta ke dauraan kam se kam teen binduon main uchit hoga
 upar harvard rifa ke suzav kaa ullekh kiya gaya he ki purv-vaarta kii baithkon main inkaa istemaal kiya janaa chahie
 doosraa, anya log gatirodh ke maamle main unke prayog kii vakaalat karte hai
 For example, companies and environmental groups involved in the negotiations of the Rio Urubamba natural gas project in Peru reached a turning point that at the time was left unsettled - roads passing through ancient forests and a huge pipeline would be an ecological disaster
 
 What is a creative solution? Think of a remote gas field as an offshore platform, take the pipeline underground and transport personnel and equipment by airway as needed
 ant main, yahaan tak ki jab vaartakar "haa" par pahunche, to samjhaute kii ek nirdhaarit samiksha vastav main "haa" se aage badhate hue rachanaatmak parinaamon tak le jaayegi
 shaayad is tarah kii ek samiksha ko samjhaute ke karyanvayan ke chah maheene baad nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 But, the point is that separate time must be kept for constructive discussion on this subject, how to improve the people who are ready for the relationship? The focus of such a session should always be on unfolding new ideas - the answer to the question "what didn't we think about?" shell ne samjhauta vaarta ke liye paanch shaileyon / pratikriyaaon kii pahchaan kii he
 vyaktiyon main aksar kai shaileyon kii ore majboot jhukaav ho saktaa he; ek samjhauta vaarta ke dauraan istemaal kii jane vaali style, anya karkon ke saath-saath prasang or duusare dal ke hiton par nirbhar karti he
 In addition, style can also change over time
 jaahir he, samjhauta vaarta ke multah bhinn in do tareekon ko bhinn drushtikon kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 ise andekha karnaa parinaam ke liye vinaashkari ho saktaa he, lekin yah sab bhi aksar hota he
 Because each negotiator in the delivery approach struggles for the largest possible piece of the pie, it can be perfectly reasonable - within certain limits - that the other party be seen as an adversary rather than a partner and relatively little Strict attitude should be adopted
 But this stance would be unfair when the effort is to seal a system which is in the best interests of both the parties
 If both win, then it is important that who has benefited more
 ek acha samjhauta vah nahin jisamen adhiktam laabh ho, balki vah he jisamen ishtatam laabh ho
 lekin iskaa nihitarth yah bilkul nahin he ki hamen apane laabh ko yun hi chhod dena chahie
 lekin ek sahyogaatmak ravaiya, niyamit rup se labhaansh kaa bhugtan karegaa
 jo phayda hua he, vah duusare kii keemat par nahin he, balki uske saath he
 Emotion plays an important role in the negotiation process, although it is only in recent years that their impact is being studied
 jazbaat main yah kshamta he ki vah samjhauta vaarta main yaa to ek sakaaratmak yaa nakaaratmak bhoomika nibhaataa he
 During negotiations, the decision whether or not to seal the agreement now depends partly on emotional factors
 nakaaratmak bhavanaaen, teevr or yahaan tak ki tarkahin vyavhaar kaa kaaran ban sakati hai or sangharsh ko falit karte hue samjhauta vaarta ko khandit sakati hai, lekin riyaayaten paane main sahaayak ho sakati hai
 On the other hand, positive emotions often make it easier to reach an agreement and help to maximize joint profits, but can also be helpful in achieving concessions
 sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak asatat bhaawanaaon ko kaaryon or sambandhparak parinaamon ko prabhavit karne ke liye pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he or saanskrithik simaaon ke aar-paar yah bhinn bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he
 Emotion effect: Temperamental sentiment affects various stages of the negotiation process: what strategies are planned to be used, which strategies are actually chosen, the approach by which the other parties and their intentions are viewed, one His desire to reach agreement and the final outcome of the negotiations
 The positive efficacy and negative efficacy of one or more parties to the negotiation negotiations can lead to very different results
 samjhauta vaarta kii prakriya shuru hone se pehle, sakaaratmak bhav vaale logon main adhik aatmavishvaas, or ek sahyogaatmak ranneeti ke upyog kii yojana banane kii ucch pravriti hoti he
 During negotiation negotiations, negotiators who are in a positive mood tend to enjoy this interaction more, show less contentious behavior, use less aggressive tactics and adopt more collaborative strategies
 isse dalon dwaara apane mahatvapurn lakshya tak pahunchane kii sambhaavna bad jaati he or ekikrut laabh khojane kii kshamta kaa sanvardhan hota he
 Of course, negotiators with positive efficacy reached more agreements than negotiators with negative or natural efficacy, and they showed a greater tendency to respect those agreements
 These favorable results stemmed from a better decision-making process, such as flexible thinking, Creative problem solving, respecting others' attitudes, willingness to take risks and high confidence
 Even after negotiations positive results have beneficial results
 hasil kiye gaye parinaam ke saath yah santushti ko badhaata he or vyakti kii bhavishya kii sahabhaagita kii ichha ko prabhavit karata he
 The PA that emerged from reaching an agreement eases bilateral relations, increasing effective commitment that paves the way for subsequent engagement
 PA kii apni kamiyaan bhi hai: yah swa-pradarshan kii dharna ko vikrut karata he, is tarah ki pradarshan ko apekshaakrit behatar samajha jaataa he jitna vah vastav main nahin he
 Thus, studies with their own reports on the results obtained may be biased
 nakaaratmak bhav kaa samjhauta vaarta kii prakriya ke vibhinn charnon par hanikaarak prabhaav padataa he
 Although various negative emotions influence the outcomes of negotiations, the most research on anger has been done so far
 krodhi vaartakar, vaarta shuru hone se pehle hi pratispardhi ranneeti kaa adhik upyog karne kii yojana banaate hai or kam sahyog karte hai
 These competitive strategies are related to the combined results
 krodh, vaarta ke dauraan vishwaas ke str ko kam karte hue, dalon ke nirnay ko dhoomil karte hue, dalon ke kendrit dhyaan ko sankuchit karte hue prakriya ko baadhit karata he or samjhaute tak pahunchane ke unke kendriya lakshya ko badalte hue unhen duusare paksh ke khilaaf pratikriyaatmak banaata he
 Angry negotiators pay less attention to the opponent's interests and are less accurate in identifying their interests, thus giving them less joint advantage
 iske alaava, chunki krodh vaartakaron ko unki praathamiktaaon main adhik aatm-kendrit banaata he, yah is sambhaavna ko badha detaa he ki ve laabhadaayak peshkash ko asweekaar kar denge
krodh, samjhauta vaarta ke lakshyon ko praapt karne main madad bhi nahin karata he: yah sanyukt laabh ko kam kar detaa he or vyaktigat laabh ke vardhan main madad nahin karata, kyonki krodhit vaartakar apane liye kiye gaye adhik ke daavon safal nahin hote
 iske alaava, nakaaratmak bhavanaaen aise samjhauton ko sweekaar karne ko prerit karti hai jo sakaaratmak upyogetavaadi kriya vaala nahin he balki usamen nakaaratmak upyogita hoti he
 However, the expression of negative feelings during conciliation negotiations can sometimes be beneficial: justly expressed anger can be an effective way to show one's commitment, honesty, and needs
 iske alaava, haalanki NA, ekikrut kaaryon main laabh ko kam kar detaa he, vitaran kaaryon main yah PA se ek behatar ranneeti he 
 nakaaratmak bhav utpatti or shwet rav par apane kaam main, cednar ko, anya jaateey mul ke vaktaaon ke avamulyan ke sambandh main prekshan ke madhyam se ek nakaaratmak bhav utpatti tantra ke astitv ke liye samarthan praapt hua
 "conciliation negotiations may, in turn, be negatively affected by a hostile envy of an ethnic group or a gender group
 anusandhan darshata he ki vaartakar kii bhavanaaen aavashyak rup se samjhauta vaarta kii prakriya ko prabhavit nahin karti
 albrasine va anya ne suzav diya ki bhaavnaatmak prabhaav ke liye do sthitiyaan hai, donon hi kshamta se or prerana se sambandhit hai: According to this model, emotions are likely to affect negotiation only when one is high and the other is low
 jab kshamta or prerana, donon hi nimna hai to bhav kii pahchaan nahin kii ja sakegi or jab donon hi ucch hai to bhav kii pahchaan kii ja sakegi lekin faisle ke liye ise apraasangik mana jayega
udhaaharan ke liye, is model kaa ek sambhav nihitarth yah he ki vaarta par PA ke sakaaratmak prabhaavon ko tabhi dekha ja saktaa he jab yaa to prerana yaa kshamta nimna hai
 Most studies on emotion in negotiation negotiations focus on the effect of the negotiator's own feelings on the process
 haalanki, aglaa dal kya sochataa he yah bhi utana hi mahatvapurn ho saktaa he, hamen pataa he ki samooh bhavanaaen vyaktigat str or samooh ke str par prakriyaaon ko prabhavit karti he
 When it comes to negotiation, trust in the other party is necessary to influence its feeling and visibility increases the effect
 bhavanaaen, samjhauta vaarta kii prakriya main is prakaar yogadan detii hai ki ye yah sanket detii hai ki vyakti kya mahasoos karata he or sochataa he or is prakaar anya dal ko vighatnkaaree vyavhaar main ulajhane se roak sakati hai or ingit karti hai ki aglaa kadam aage kya hona chahie: PA bhi yahi sanket detaa he, jabaki NA ingit karata he ki maansik yaa vyavahaargat samaayojan kii aavashyaktaa haisathi kii bhaawanaaon kaa vaartakar kii bhaawanaaon or vyavhaar par do buniyadi prabhaav ho saktaa he: anukaranaatmak / parsparik yaa poorak
 udhaaharan ke liye, niraashaa yaa udaasi, dayaa or adhik sahyog ko prerit karegi
 bat va anya dwaara ek adhyayan main jisane vaastavik bahu charan samjhauta vaarta kii nakal kii, zyaadaatar logon ne saathi kii bhaawanaaon ke prati poorak tareeke kii bajaay parsparik tareeke se pratikriya vyakt kii
dekha gaya ki virdohi kii bhaawanaaon or chaynit ranneetiyon par vishisht bhaawanaaon kaa alag-alag prabhaav hota he: Negotiations are a complex interaction
 isaki sari jatiltaaon ko aavrutt karnaa ek bahut hi mushkil kaam he, iske sirf kuch pahaluon ko alag or niyantrit kiya gaya he
 For this reason, most studies of negotiation are conducted under laboratory conditions and they throw light on only a few aspects
 haalanki prayogshaala adhyayan ke apane phaayde hai, unki kuch pramukh kamiyaan hai jab bhaawanaaon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he : The primary objective of this section is to demonstrate the extent of cultural differences in settlement negotiations and to show how these differences can cause problems in international trade negotiations
 pathak yah dekhenge ki rashtriya samskruti samjhauta vaarta ke vyavhaar kaa nirdhaaran nahin karti he
 Rather, national culture is one of many factors that influence behavior at the negotiating table, albeit in a significant way
 For example, gender, organizational culture, international experience, industry, or regional background can all have significant impacts
 beshak, sabhi prakaar kaa rudh praaroop khatarnaak hai or antarrashtriya vaartakaron ko un logon ke bare main zarur jaananaa chahie jinke saath ve kaam kar rahe hai, sirf unke desh, samskruti, yaa company ke bare main hi nahin
 The material here is based on a systematic study of the international settlement negotiations behavior of the last three decades, considering the negotiation styles of more than 1500 people from 17 industry-related countries
