 According to the opinion of some scholars, this is a science of energy and it discusses the conversion of energy and its material relations
 iske dwaara praakrit jagat or uski aantarik kriyaaon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Location, time, speed, matter, electricity, light, heat and sound etc

 yah vigyaan kaa ek pramukh vibhaag he
 Its principles are valid throughout science and apply in every part of science
 iskaa kshetra vistrut he or isaki seemaa nirdhaarit karnaa ati dushkar he
 All scientific subjects come under this in a small amount
 vigyaan kii anya shakhayein yaa to sidhe hi bhautik par aadhaarit hai, athwa inke tathyon ko iske mul siddhanton se sambhddha karne kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 The importance of physics is also more because being the birthplace of engineering and crafts science, it is the basic motivator of all social and economic development of this era
 bahut pehle isko darshan shaastra kaa ang maanakar natural philosophy yaa prakritik darshanashastra kehete the, kintu 1870 isvi ke lagbhag isko vartmaan naam bhautikee yaa physics dwaara sambodhit karne lage
 Gradually this science kept progressing and at this time seeing the rapid pace of its development, even the leading physicists are surprised
 dhire-dhire isse anek mahatvapurn shakhaon kii utpatti hui, jaise rasinic bhautikee, tara bhautikee, jeevbhautikee, bhubhautikee, nabhikeey bhautikee, akashiya bhautikee ityadi
 The main principle of physics is "law of conservation of energy"

 It is not possible to increase or decrease this quantity by internal actions of the community
 urja ke anek rup hote hai or uskaa roopantaran ho saktaa he, kintu uski maatra main kisi prakaar parivartan karnaa sambhav nahin ho saktaa
 According to Einstein's theory of relativity, mass can also be converted into energy
 is prakaar urja sangrakshan or dravyaman sangrakshan donon siddhanton kaa samanvay ho jaataa he or is siddhant ke dwaara bhautikee or rasayan ek duusare se sambhddha ho jate hai
 Physics can be broadly divided into two parts
 1900 isvi se purv jo bhautik gyaan arjeet kiya gaya tha or tatsambandhi jo niyam tathaa siddhant pratipaadit kiye gaye the, unka samavesh chirsmmat bhautikee main kiya gaya
 The inspirations of the ideology of that time were Galileo and Newton
 chirsmmat bhautikee ko mukhyat: yantriki, dhvaniki, ooshmaa, vidyutchumbakatv or prakaashiki main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 These branches are the cornerstone of engineering and craft science and elementary education in physics is started from them only
 1900 isvi ke pashchaat anek krantikari tathy gyaat hue, jinako chirasmmati bhautikee ke dhaanche main baithaana kathin he
 The branch of physics that originated in studying these new facts and solving their clues is called modern physics
 aadhunik bhautikee kaa dravyasanrachana se sidhaa sambandh he
 Atomic elements, nuclei and basic particles are their main subjects
 bhautikee kii is naveen shakha ne vaigyanik vichaardhaara ko naveen or krantikari mode diya he tathaa isse samaajik vigyaan or darshanashastra bhi mahatvapurn rup se prabhavit hue hai
 'currently solid state physics is known as modern physics where we reads about construction and energy of material
 There are some other branches but Electronics is the latest

 Surgical sterilization, implantable hormones and intrauterine devices all have first-year failure rates of less than 1%
 hormonal garbhanirodhak goliyaan, ptch yaa ring or ring lactateshnal rajorodh vidhi ko yadi sahi dhang se istemaal kiya jaae, to inaki pehle saal kii asafalataa dar 1% se kam hogi
 Failure rates in the first year are significantly higher, in the range of 3–9%, with specific use due to incorrect use
 anya vidhiyaan jaise ki prajnan jaagrukta, nirodh, diafram or shukranunashkon ke sahi prayog se bhi pratham varsh main asafalataa dar bahut zyada he

 Undoubtedly, this letter of Guru Govind Singh is a wonderful trinity of spirituality, diplomacy and valor

 He himself composed many texts

 There were 52 poets and writers present in his court, that is why he was also called 'sant Sipahi'
 ve bhakthi tathaa shakti ke adwitiya pratik the
 After the sacrifice of his father Guru Tegh Bahadur and his four sons, after the Battle of Khidrana in 1706 AD, Guru Govind Singh sent a letter to Bhai Daya Singh to the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb
 un dinon aurangzeb dakshin bharat ke ahmednagar main apane jivan kii antim saansen gin rahaa tha
 Bhai Daya Singh reached Ahmadnagar after traveling a long route via Delhi, Agra
 guru govind singh ke is patr se aurangzeb ko uttar bharat, visheshkar punjab kii vaastavik sthiti kaa pataa chalaa
 He understood that he was confused by the misinformation of the Mughal Subedar of Punjab, as well as he felt the valor and prestige of Guru Govind Singh
 aurangzeb ne jabardaar or mohammad yaar manasabadaar ko ek shahi farmaan dekar dilli bheja, jisamen guru govind singh ko kisi bhi prakaar kaa ksht na dene tathaa sammanpurvak laane kaa aadesh tha
 But it was not known to Guru Gobind Singh for a long time whether Bhai Daya Singh succeeded in giving Zafarnama to Aurangzeb in Ahmednagar
 at: ve swayan hi ahmednagar kii ore chal pade
 In October, 1706, he left for South India
 unhone marwar ke maarg se dakshin jane kaa vichaar kiya
 Many kings of Rajasthan welcomed him on the way

 Mahendra Singh has translated it into Gurmukhi and Surendra Jeet Singh into English

 This paper has a total of 111 poetic terms in Persian

 The description of each battle in this poetic paper is sufficient to communicate the new life in anyone

 It also includes the account of Aurangzeb's severe defeat by Marathas and Rajputs
 saath hi guru govind singh ne aurangzeb ko yah chetavanee bhi di he ki unhone punjab main uski paraajay kii puri vyavastha kar lee he
 In order to clarify the intention described in Guru Govind Singh's Zafarnama, it would be appropriate to give some of his key positions here
 guru govind singh ne jafarnama kaa prarambh ishwar ke samaran se kiya he
 He has written about himself that 'I have swore to God, which is the inscription of swords, arrows, spears and daggers, and the horses of a galloping horse in the battlefield
 ' unhone aurangzeb ko sambodhit karte hue likhaa, 'uskaa naam lekar, jisane tumhen badshahath di or mujhe dharm kii raksha kii daulat di he, mujhe vah shakti di he ki main dharm kii raksha karun or sachai kaa jhanda ooncha ho
 In this letter, Guru Govind Singh described Aurangzeb as 'sly', 'farebi' and 'makkar'
 saath hi uski ibaadat ko 'dhong' kaha tathaa use apane pita tathaa bhaaiyon kaa hatyara bhi bataaya
 Guru Gobind Singh, while introducing his self-respect and heroism, wrote, "I will put such a fire under your feet that in Punjab it will not even get water to extinguish you and drink you
" v guru govind singh ne aurangzeb ko chunauti dete hue likhaa, 'main is yuddh ke maidan main akelaa aauungaa
 You bring two horsemen with you
 ' phir likhaa, vkya hua agar mere chaar bachche maare gayi, par kundali maare dansane vaala naag abhi baaki he
 ' guru govind singh ne aurangzeb ko itihaas se sikh lene kii salaah dete hue likhaa, 'sikandar or shershah kahaan hai? aaj taimur kahaan he, babar kahaan he, humayun kahaan he, akbar kahaan he?' unhone pun: aurangzeb ko lalkaarte hue likhaa, 'agar kamajoro par julm karata he, unhen sataata he, to kasam he ki ek din aare se chirva duungaa
 With this, Guru Gobind Singh, while clarifying his policy about war and peace, wrote, 'when all efforts have been made, the path of justice is blocked, then it is right to lift the sword and it is right to fight
 ' or ant ke pad main ishwar ke prati purna aasthaa vyakt karte hue unhone likhaa, 'shatru bhale hamase hajaar tarah se shatruta kare, par jinka vishwaas ishwar par he, unka koi bal bhi baankaa nahin kar saktaa
 ' vastut: guru govind singh kaa zafarnama keval ek patr nahin balki ek vir kaa kavy he, jo bhartiya janamanas kii bhaawanaaon kaa dyotak he
 Not many patriots have taken inspiration from this letter from past to present
 guru govind singh ke vyaktitv tathaa krititv kii jhalak unke zafarnama se prakat hoti he
 His letter is a call to war, not a treaty
