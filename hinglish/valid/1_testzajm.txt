 amrish puri charitra abhinayta madan puri ke chote bhai amrish puri hindi filmon kii duniya kaa ek pramukh stambh rahe hai
 Shri Puri, who made his mark in films such as actor Nishant, Manthan and Bhumika, later gained considerable fame as a villain
 unhone 1984 me bani stewen spilberg kii film "indiana jones and da temple of duum" main molaram kii bhoomika nibhaai jo kaafii charchit rahi
 This role had such an impact that he decided to always keep his head shaved
 is kaaran khalanaayak kii bhoomika bhi unhen kaafii mili
 Despite working prominently in commercial films, his love for parallel or divergent films remained and he was also associated with such films
 phir aayaa khalanaayak kii bhoomikaaon se hatakar charitra abhinayta kii bhoomikaaon vaale amrish puri kaa daur
 And even in this period, he did not let the magic of his acting arts diminish
 amrish puri ne sadi kii sabase badi filmon main kaary kiya
 He has praised the character of "babuji" in Shah Rukh Khan's hit film "dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"
 unhone mukhyatah filmo me villen kaa paatr nibhaate dekha gaya he
 He played the character of "mogambo" in 1987's Anil Kapoor's Mr
 India, which is the main villain of the film
 isi film main amrish kaa dialog "mogambo khush hua" film-jagat main prasiddh he
 Damoh Lok Sabha constituency is a Lok Sabha constituency in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India
 emeter yaa 'emmapi' kisi paripath kii kisi shakha main bahane vaali vidyut dhara ko maapne vaala yantra he
 The devices used to measure very small currents are called "millimeter" or "micrometer"
 ameter kii sabase puraani dizin di'arsonal kaa dharamapi yaa chalit kundalee dharamapi tha
 In 1820, the ampere invented that if a conductor, in which current flows, is placed in a magnetic field, then a force acts on it
 is bal kaa maan chumbakeey kshetra kii tivrata, dharaman or chaalak kii lambaai ke gunanfal ke baraabar hota he
 The direction of this force is determined by Fleming's left-hand law
 apane baayein haath kaa angutha, uske paas kii ungali or bich kii ungali madhyamaa kaa is prakaar failaayen ki ve teenon ek duusare ke lamberup rahen
 If the index finger points in the direction of the magnetic field and the median in the direction of the current, then the speed of the conductor will be in the direction of the thumb
 chumbakeey kshetra main rakhi hui kisi kundali main jab vidyutdhara pravaahit hoti he, to kundali par ek balyugma kaary karne lagata he, jisus vah ghoomane lagati he
 The dharmapi that have been made by using this principle, they are called chalakunda dharamapi
 isamen ek ytaakar kundali hoti he, jisamen patale or vidyutrodhit taanbe ke taar ke bahut chakkar hote hai
 This coil is hung with a screw by a very thin leaf of phosphor brange, one end of the coil is attached to this leaf and the leaf is connected to a connective screw of the dielectric
 is pattee main ek vrittakar samtal yaa natodar darpan bhi laga rahata he, jo pattee ke saath saath ghumta he
 The second end of the coil is connected to a spiral spring of metal, which is connected to the second connective screw
 yah kundali ek shaktishaalee sthaayee naal chumbak ke dhruvon ke bich main lataki rahati he
 The poles of the magnet are curved in concave cylindrical shape
 ek narm lohe kaa chota sa belan donon dhruvakhandon ke bich main kundali ke bheetar ek pech dwaara dharamapi kii peeth main ksaa rahata he
 All these items are kept locked in an non-magnetic box
 baks ke saamne ke bhaag main kaanch laga rahata he, jisase darpan kaa vikshep lamp tathaa paimaana vidhi se napa ja sake
 When electric current flows in the coil, a force act on the two arms of the coil and rotate the coil from its position, causing a spasm in the phosphor brange leaf and the downward spiral spring and a twitch force pair
 But starts working in the opposite direction
 jisase kundali sheeghra hi santulan main aa jaati he
 If the coil has a deflection angle, the current comes from the following formula: arthath dharaman vikshep kone kaa samaanupati hota he
 These thermometers are very stable and suitable sensitizers
 inase 10-10 ampiore tak kii dhara naapi ja sakati he
 There are mainly two types of magnetoscope
 isamen kundali ek dhaatu ke dhaanche par lapet di jaati he, jisase dhara pravaahit hone par kundali vikshepit ho sheeghra sthir ho jaati he
 As the coil rotates, vortex currents arise in it and its metal structure and stop the coil
 kundali dolan nahin karti, isi se is yantra ko mrit-spand kehete hai
 The horoscope reaches its former position as soon as the current is removed
 atev dhara kaa maan kundali kii purvasthiti tathaa dhara pravaahit hone par kii sthiti ke gyaan se badi saralata se gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 In this currentometer, the coil is tied on a dielectric structure and due to this, there is no vortex current in it
 at: kundali ke vikshep main bahut kam pratirodh padataa he
 The coil oscillates on both sides of its deflection when the current is not flowing through the metal structure
 yah ati sookshmagrahi hota he or kshanik aavesh ko bhi badi sugamawapurv isse ham gyaat kar sakate hai
 These are of two types: attractors and repulsors
 vidyutrodhi taron kii ek sthir kundali se yadi vidyutdhara pravaahit ho, to kundali ke bich main or aasapaas main bhi chumbakeey kshetra utpann hota he
 If a piece of cast iron is hung near this horoscope, it gets attracted towards the coil
 is lohe ke tukade main agar ek sanketak laga ho, to sanketak bhi vikshepit ho jayega
 If there is such a mechanism that it can be brought to equilibrium by applying force opposite to the attraction force on the piece of iron, then the value of the current will be known by the deflection of the indicator
 bahudhaa ek sarpil kamaani dwaara is aakarshanabal kaa virodh kiya jaataa he
 The force of attraction is proportional to the square of the current-value
 isliye sanketak kaa vikshep bhi dhara maan ke varg ke samaanupati hoga
 For this reason, it can also find the value of alternating current
 vidyutarodhi taron ke kai chakkaaron kii sthir kundali ke bich, do naram lohe ke patale chad kundali ke aksh ke samaantar lage hai
 One rod is fixed, the other is connected to an indicator which is mounted on a nail itself
 sanketak kaa doosraa sira ek dial par ghumta he
 When the current flows in the coil, both rods become the same type of induced magnet
 chumbakeey niyamon ke anusaar unamem pratikarshan hoto he or sanketak se judaa loha gum jaataa he, jisase sanketak main vikshep hota he
 In this also, the deflection angle is proportional to the square of the torrent
 ye yantra atyant saral or saste hote hai
 When measurement does not require much precision and many robust instruments are required, then ammeters and voltmeters based on this principle are used
 bijli gharon main switchboard par narm lohe ke yantron kaa hi prayog adhiktar hota he
 The attraction or repulsion in the induced magnet does not depend on the direction of fluency
 bal dharaman ke varg kaa samaanupati hota he
 Therefore whatever the direction of current flow, the direction of force is same
 inhen kaarnon se ye yantra disht dhara athwa prayavartin dhara donon ko naapane ke prayog main laae jate hai
 Due to the inductance of the coil, they cannot be used in the measurement of high frequency alternating current
 is prakaar ke emeter vidyutdhara ke ooshmiya prabhaav par nirbhar hote hai
 When current flows through a conductor, then that conductor becomes hot
 utpann ooshmaa kaa maan 2 x ke samaanupati hota he
 If the current is in the ampere and the resistance is in ohms, then ooshmaa kaa maan dharaman ke varg ke samaanupati hota he, arthath dhara kii disha par nirbhar nahin hai
 Therefore, such ammeters can be used to measure both directional or alternating current
 is prabhaav kaa prayog maapanvidhi main do prakaar se kiya gaya he : The first type of instrument was first created by Major Cardew in 1883
 hartman-bron ne isamen sadhaar kiya
 The current flows in the wire and spreads as it is heated
 is samay taar ke bich main judi hui kamaani taar ko khinchati he or ghirani prasar ke anusaar gum jaati he
 At the same time, the pulley indicator is deflected and the current value is displayed on the dial
 dhara kii anupasthiti main taar thandha ho kar sikudta he or sanketak phir apni purv dasha main aa jaataa he
 Such integrators have been used a lot due to being simple and cheap
 inamen kundali nahin hoti, is kaaran unamem prerakatv nahin hota or ucch aavriti kii prayavartin dhara bhi naapi jaati he, parantu ye paryaapt rup se yatharth nahin hote or adhik maatra kii dhara ko sahan karne main asamarth hote hai
 These are more convenient and accurate thermo-thermometer
 aajkal ucch aavriti kii prayavarti dhara kaa maapan adhiktar unheen yantron se hota he
 The current flows through the wire and heats it
 is taar se jude hue tamba kanstantan taapyugma kaa sangam bhi garam hota he
 Due to this, electric carrying force is produced in the ratio of heat to temperature
 yah ek disht dharamapi main dhara pravaahit karata he
 When the dial is calibrated, it displays the value of the first alternating current

 Literature, whether it is from any country or language, has always been indebted to its folklore and the art of mass democracy present in it
 apni mukhya preranaon ke liye aadhaar-saamagree vah shruti parampara se grahan karata he
 Even though the work of codification of social duties and responsibilities has been scholarly, but the work of observing, preserving and extending the country-longitude comes only as part of the people
 atah jis desh kaa loksahitya samrudh he vahaan samskruti or paramparaon ko bachaane-nikhaarane ke saath-saath nae gyaan ko aatmsaat karne main apekshaakrit kam samay lagata he
 The tradition of education in India is derived from the Gurukuls
 satya kii khoj ke liye na jane kitne nachiketao ne is desh main raaj-paat chode hai
 It is a different matter that the facility of methodical learning was earlier limited to specific sections of the society
 jiske dushprinamvash karn or eklavya jaise jigyaasuon kii gyaan kii talash antat abhipsa hi siddh hoti rahi he
 The importance of the art of mass communication for the education-deprived class was more than that of the rest of the society
 visheshkar saamanti daur main jab prakaashan kii duniya aaj jitani badi or samathryavan nahin thi, saamaajik sambandhon, vargeey jatilta ke chalate jansankhya ke bahulansh ko sansadhano se vanchit kar diya jaataa tha
 The art of mass media was then used to fulfill the entertainment-related needs of the general public, to carry the traditions of experience and knowledge to the next generation and to preserve them
 kaha ja saktaa he ki itihaas, parampara, vyavhaar, saanskrithik pratikon evam mithkon ko sangrahntiya banane tathaa unka anveshan-vishleshan karne ke liye bauddhikon ne ek ore jahaan shastray ganrathon kii rachana kii, vahiin unhen lokmanas tak pahunchane or janajivan kaa hissaa banane ke saath-saath lokranjan ke liye kissagoi kii kala kaa vikaas hua
 It is not possible to tell exactly when the story started and where
 keval anumaan hi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In the early period of civilization, when man must have tried to exaggerate something about a unique object, creature or event, in some interesting manner and with the desire of Lokaranjan; Naturally, there must have been arrogance in the rest of the people about his saying
 parinamtah un anubhavon ke prati samuhik jigyaasa tathaa unako rochak andaaj main, baar-baar sune-kahe jane kii parampara kaa vikaas hua
 The proportion of imagination also increased progressively
 isi se loksahitya or kissagoi kii kala kaa vikaas hua
 Now the question arises, what is anecdote and anecdote? kahani kaa bada swaroop aisa jo apekshaakrit lambey samay tak chale, jiske kathanak main kai mode, charitron ke takaraav, bhaawanaaon ke utaar-chadhaav, maansik udwelan or vichaaron kaa sangharsh ho, vah kissa kii koti main aata he
 It is also known as Baat or Baqahi
 kissa ekal kathanak pradhan bhi ho saktaa he or bahukthankon kaa samucchy bhi
 Sometimes, many short stories filled with diverse gestures are wrapped around the main plot
 choti-choti kahaniyon ko gunfit kar bade kathanak kaa rup dene or unhen kissagoi main dhaalane kii parampara duniya ke praayah sabhi deshon main, na keval maujuud balki lokapriy bhi rahi he
 Their form also varied with time and circumstances
 kissago apni yogyata or kalpanaashakti ke dam par unhen or adhik rochak tathaa smaraneey banane ke liye aavashyaktaanusaar pherbadal karata rahata tha
 In bound words, anecdote is an art of visualization of imagination
 jisase ham sabhi kaa vaasta padataa rahata he
 Along with the mother's lullaby 


 when the child begins to recognize the meaning of the words, probably since
 kissagoi ko lekar bachapan se shuru hua sammohan tajindagi kam nahin hota
 It contains the melody of imagination
 aisa laalitya samahit hota jisamen aakhar bolne lagate hai
 Words are spoken
 arth swayan mukhar ho uthte hai
 Despite being fictional, his description is so authentic, rhymed and lively that the audience gets carried away
 lekhan ke sandarbh main yah ek vishisht style he
 In which the narrator is in a state of address with his reader
 likhane ke bajaae vah kahani ko kahata he
 The story also adds to the creativity of the story
 jisase rachana main naad saundarya swaabhaavik rup se utar aata he or uski grahyata bad jaati he
 As a result, the reader and listener experience more pleasure and fulfillment
 lokparampara main maanya kissagoi hi shastray bhashaa aakhyaan ban jaati he
 Stories and stories have been very important in mass culture
 praayah samaaj ke bade-boode hi kissago kii jimmedaari ko sambhalate the
 Sometimes this art also became the basis of people's livelihood
 acchhee kahani ke saath sunaane kii behtareen kala sone par suhaage kaa kaam karti he
 There have also been talented stories that, without any prior preparation, just on the strength of their imagination, used to start telling a sutra and talk / misleading would take the form of an increasingly funny story or anecdote
 paaramparik gramin jivan main naitik evam saamaajik chetana itani pragadh thi ki vyaktimaatra unase vichlan ke khataron ko na keval pahachaanata tha, balki yathasambhav usase dur rahane kaa prayaas bhi karata tha
 It did not require any external undertaking like literature to make him aware of moral and social values; As it is felt today
 tab yah kaary dharm evam lokachar se jude vividh madhyamon dwaara sampann hota tha
 In other words, social values were developed along with the mind in the rural life devoted to co-operation and coexistence, and there was hardly any duality between them
 nishchay hi jansanvaadan kii kala jiskaa ek rup kissagoi bhi he, kaa isamen bahut bada yogadan tha
 And among the redundancy of the media, there is less, but it remains the same today
 chepal samskruti krishi samaajon kii pahchaan rahi he
 It was mandatory to have a chapel in every village
 yahi nahin chepal ke kshetraphal uske nirmaan main prayukt saamagree, vaastu-shilp aadi se gaanv-bhar ke maan-maryaada kaa nirdhaaran hota tha
 The art of kissing flourished on these chapals
 lekin kissago ke liye jaruri nahin tha ki apni hunarpeshi ke liye chepal ko hi chune
 In the summer the cattle grazing under the trees, enjoying the raindrops under the open sky in the rainy, warming the bonfires at the village's crossings, in the winter, spent the night in the hut-scarred huts, the stories continued unabated
 Were
 kissagoi ke prati anuraag samaaj ke kisi khaas varg yaa samudaay tak simit nahin tha
 Rather, almost all sections of society took interest in it
 kuch logon kii jeevika to raja-maharaajaaon ko kissa sunaane se hi chalati thi
 There is also some evidence that in the old times there were some such skilled people in the court of the emperor; Who used to tell stories to him and his princess only
 safal kissago ko apni jeevika ke liye bhatakana nahin padataa tha
 Folk spirit devoted to coexistence and non-existence used to have some stronghold to meet its needs
 aasapaas ke gaanvon se unke liye bulaave aate hi rahete
 During Thalwar, Daksha Kisago used to visit remote villages
 kisi meley, parv-tyohaar athwa vivaahadi ke avasar par aise kalakaar jab kahin pahunchate to vahaan dhooma much jaati thi
 After a day's work, people started gathering with them to share their experiences and joys and sorrows
 jahaan mausam, vibhinn saamaajik sthitiyon par vichaar-vimarsh ke alaava, manoranjan kaa khyaal bhi rakhaa jaataa tha
 In which both prose and verse forms found place
 padya rachanaaon main dhola-maaru, aalha, ramayana aadi pramukh thim to gadhy main mukhyatah kisse sune-sunaae jate the
 Among which alif-laila, Kissa parrot-maina, Sahasra Rajanititra, Dastane Char Darvesh, Throne Batisi, Vaital Pachisi, Kathasaritsagar, Jataka stories etc
 were prominent
 ye kisse jansamanya main behad lokapriy the tathaa bhinn-bhinn roopon main bina unke mul strot ko jane, sune-sunaae jate the
 Not only this, in order to maintain interestingness and attraction according to the occasion, Kissago was also free to change his interest and interest in him
 kuch kisse gadhy tathaa padya donon hi rup main prrrachlit the tathaa yah kissago-kalakaar kii yogyata tathaa shrotaaon kii pasand par nirbhar karata tha ki vah prastutikaran ke liye kis vidha kaa chayan karte hai
 The plot was often well known to the audience
 unki moulikta ke prati kissago kaa koi daawa bhi nahin hota tha
 The style of presentation of the story was original
 ucch kalpanaashakti, moulik style, dilkash sampreshan or paatro kii andruni jaddojahad ko ubhaarne main safal kalakaar hi janamanas ko apane jaadui prabhaav main laane main kaamyaab rahete the
 On the basis of that, their claim to superiority would be determined
 samaaj main kissagoi kii parampara ke sampusht hone kaa hi parinaam tha ki ramcharitamanas kii shuruyaat tulsidas kakbhushundi ke mukh se karaate hai
 The profoundly serious philosopher Gavishna, like the Gita, comes from the face of Shri Krishna, Arjuna is a volume listener there
 puri mahabharat sanjay kaa ‘kathan’ he
 This is the secret of the popularity of Devkinandan Khatri, Premchand, Pandey Bechan Sharma 'ugra', Amritlal Nagar, Vijayadan Detha etc
 among the modern prose of Kisagoi style
 markhej ke gadhy main maujuud jaadui yatharthwaad darasal kissagoi kaa vah laalitya hi he; jisaki aaj puri duniya divaani ho rahi he
 Being an indispensable part of the ethos, it is important that the story should be tested by the public
 use lokaruchi ke anusaar vishyon ke chayan kii kala aati ho
 It is noteworthy that the story has developed as an art of mass entertainment
 kahan ke bheetar hi samooh ke prati sambodhan kii bhaavana chhipi he
 Man is a social animal
 uske sukh-dukh saajhe hai
 Therefore, everyone has the same rights over the medium of entertainment or public entertainment
 kissago yah maanakar chalata he ki vah dusron ke, jo asal main uske apane hi samaaj kaa hissaa hai, kalyaan kaa hetu he
 That is why it often presents itself with a sense of belonging and harmony, without any greed for presentation
 janakalyaan kii bhaavana or uske liye nishaklush samarpan hi kissa or kissagoi ko sarvaswikaarya or upyogi banaata he
 In the book, however, kisasagoi exists only as a genre
 or unase guzarate samay pathak praayah akelaa hi hota he
 But it is presented in a collective address where the author narrates rather than writes
 jisase pathak ko hameshaa yah anubhuti bani rahati he ki vah akelaa nahin he
 But Brihad is a very important unit of society
 kissagoi kaa yahi gun usko sampreshan kii baaki shaileyon se alag or vishisht siddh karata he tathaa uski lokvyapti kii sambhaavnaaon ko badhaata he
 Hence collectivity can be seen as an essential feature of anecdote
 samuhikta ke saath-saath sarvloukikta kii bhaavana bhi kissagoi se sambhddha rahati he
 However, different countries and societies of the world have their own special characteristics due to geographical and situational reasons
 vahi use baaki deshon or samaajon se alag siddh karti hai
 Despite this, there are some similarities in the nature of people living in different countries and societies
 vahi unhen ek-duusare ke kareeb bhi laati hai
 Just like all societies in the world think the same about morality
 praayah sabhi maanviya samaajon main pranimatra ke prati karunaa ko udaatt maanviya mulya mana gaya gaya he
 Similarly, charity is the essential duty name in all societies
 iske vipareet jhooth, beyimaani, dhokhaa aadi dugurnon ko hey maanate hue inase bachane kii shiksha sabhi samaajon main samaanroop main di jaati he
 For the success of an anecdote, it is necessary that behind it there is a lofty sense of eternal life value and universalism
 tabhi use vibhinn ruchi or vichaar ke vyaktiyon kaa samarthan mil paata he
 Due to this, Kisagoi-dominated creations prove to be successful in traveling across the world by crossing the boundaries of the country and regions
 is bich unamem haalanki kuch na kuch antar swaabhaavik rup se aa hi jaataa he, magar rachana kii mul aatma praayah aparivartit hi rahati he
 Often the same subjects are successful in getting acceptance in the story which are beyond dispute and whose everlasting usefulness has been proved
 yahaan tak ki manoranjan ke str par bhi yah dhyaan baraabar rakhaa jaataa he ki usase kisi vyakti, dharm athwa varg kii bhavanaaen aahat na hon
 And he should not be so 'bulgar' that he cannot be heard or heard in the group
 aise vishay jo desh-kaal kii simaaon se pare hon or thode-bahut badlaav ke baad kisi bhi samaaj kii kahani kaa aadhaar ban saken; jinamein anrtnihit satya bahusankhyak samaajon kaa satya banane kii yogyata rakhata ho, kisson main zyada lokapriy maane jate hai
 Kisagoi was born to Lokaranjan
 log pramukhtah manoranjan kii talash main kissago ke sampark main aate hai
 The underlying values in the story-story remain after that
 isliye kissagoi ke aavashyak lakshanon main rochakata bhi vishesh mahatva rakhti he
 In the absence of this, the success of the story is not possible
 iskaa arth yah bhi na maan liya jaae ki keval manoranjan hi kissagoi kaa abhisht hota he
 Any statement about life and humanity becomes important only when it either explains any rationale or is connected to it in some way
 lokranjan yadi sakaaratmak charitron, ghatnaon par aadhaarit he athwa unhen kisi bhi rup main varenya siddh karata he to shrota / pathak usase saamanytah prerana lete hi hai
 Therefore, in an anecdote, insistence on morality is always required
 parantu use iske dabaavaan se sarvatha mukt rahanaa chahie
 There should be no intrusion of morality on the value of interestingness in the story
 duusare shabdon main gyaan athwa mulya rachanaatmak prastuti ke samutpaada athwa sah-utpaada to ho sakate hai, mul utpaada nahin
 Even if this is so, this work should be done with such skill that the reader or listener does not even realize it
 yani rachana kaa prastutikaran itnaa sahaj or rasaatmak hona chahie ki vah shrotaaon-pathakon ko apane jaadui aakarshan main baandh le
 One of the criteria for success in Kisago is how close Kisago is able to bring its reader or listener to you during the presentation
 antarangta kaa yahi gun logon ke dilon main kissago ke prati lagaav paidaa karata he
 This continues to take his popularity forward
 safal kissago vahi he jisaki aawaaj ke uthaan ke saath-saath shrota antariksh kii saiyr karne lagen or uskaa tehraav dekhakar unhen vakt tehra-tehra-sa lagane lage
 Whose listener or reader, while listening or reading the composition, feel himself so intimate with it that there is no possibility of any kind of duality, just drifting in the flow of anecdote
 iske liye kissago ko apane bauddhik aham se kai paaydaan neeche utarkar apane apane shrota yaa pathak se sidhe samvaad karnaa hota he
 a sense of incompatibility of any kind not only makes Kissago's style cumbersome; It can also push listeners / readers towards other means of entertainment
 jaahir he ki iske liye prastuti ko bhashaa ke str par bhi sanvarna or tarashna padataa he
 The use of intuitive idiomatic language helps in improving the narrative
 jaisaa ki upar kaha gaya he ki kissa kalatmak kahan kii parampara kaa niksh he
 In which Kissago presents any piece of history, event or story in an interesting way to the listener with the sum of his experience, knowledge and imagination
 kuch is tarah ki shrota usamen duubakar rah jaaen
 Even they do not realize the time
 vah praayah brihad shrotavarg ko sambodhit hota he
 Which can also be illiterate and of different moods and interests
 bhashaai bojhilta, shailigat chamatkaaron athwa vaicharik kattarta kaa kissagoi main koi sthaan nahin hota
 Simple, idiomatic and full of dispatching language is suitable for kissing
 is kasuti par khara utarana har achche kissago ke liye ek chunauti hoti he
 It depends on the narrator's own style, creativity and presentation skills to be able to captivate his readers / listeners
 muhaavaron or lokoktiyon kaa aasaan or avasraanukool upyog use lokapriy tathaa prabhavayukt banaata he
 In this part of the article, we will assess the usefulness of storytelling in the context of child literacy
 yah bhi jaanane kaa prayaas karenge ki kissagoi pradhan rachanaaen bacchon main kyon adhik lokapriy hoti hai
 Almost all societies have been victims of gender base discrimination
 kissagoi kii kala yadhyapi striyon or bacchon main samaanroop se lokapriy rahi he
 But due to the circumstantial difference there has been some variation
 chepal-samskruti kii maryaada yaa uski seemaa ke chalate chapaalon par jawan, bachche or boode to ja sakate the
 But women and young children were prohibited for various reasons
 is kaaran kissagoi kii kala gharon main bhi samaanroop main viksit to hui, parantu kinchit bhinnata ke saath
 One of the main differences between the two is that the work on the chapals was often done by a skilled storyteller or a well-versed person who specialized in the art of storytelling
 vahiin gharon main yah daayitv dada-daadi, naanaa-nani, buaa yaa aise hi parivaar ke kisi varisht sadsy dwaara uthaaya jaataa tha
 It was only through an anecdote that the child was given practical knowledge of his tradition, culture and politics etc
 bachapan main kisse-kahani ke prati janma anuraag hi vyakti ko kissagoi ke charchit thikaanonμ jaise chairahon, chapaalon tathaa aise hi anya saarvjaanik sthalon tak le jaataa tha
 Whereas due to circumstantial differences, domestic performances were often limited to small stories
 aksar chapaalon par sunaae jane vaale bade kisse sankshipt rup lekar baat yaa batakahi kaa rup dhaaran kar lete the
 However, the magic of Kisagoi was completely present in them too
 kaha ja saktaa he ki praarambhik shikshan-sanskaar ke saath-saath kissagoi ke liye utsuk maanas, uske prati anuraag or aakarshan ghar ke angan, mata kii god se hi paidaa hone lagata tha or balak unheen ke madhyam se baahar kii duniya ko samajhane kaa prayaas karata tha
 The story of Kisagoi is amazing due to which in the past, stories used to travel to far-flung countries without any publication facility, even media
 puraa loksahitya dekha jaae to kissagoi kii kala kaa rini he
 Due to the popularity and accessibility of Kisagoi, Panchatantra stories are not only prevalent in all countries around the world but they have also undergone extensive changes to suit local interests and traditions
 iskaa sabase acha udhaaharan isap kii kahaniyaan hai jinpar panchatantra kaa puraa-puraa prabhaav he
 Born in the sixth century BC, Aesop was a minor slave in Greece
 shakl-surat se badsoorat
 But his fans were not lacking
 apane samaaj main uskaa sammaan tha
 Because he was an excellent anecdote skilled in the art of pulsing his listeners
 niti or vyaavhaarik gyaan ko kahaniyon main dhalkar sunaane main usko maharath hasil thi
 In his stories he also used the stories of Panchatantra which reached Greece after traveling thousands of miles
 lagbhag satarah shatabdiyon tak isap kii kahaniyaan shruti ke madhyam se ek desh se duusare desh tak kii yatra karti raheen
 The Chinese philosopher Confucius also used the parable tradition to propagate his ideas among the masses
 kissagoi kii mahatta ko darshata ek udhaaharan or bhi he
 The story of a badass king who is very funny in himself and is still heard and heard with a lot of juice
 usamen kisse kaa shaukeen badshaah kisi baat par shahzadi se naaraaz ho jaataa he
 Before the punishment, the wise princess wants him to narrate an anecdote
 badshaah taiyaar ho jaataa he
 But as soon as one anecdote came to an end, Shahzadi would have added another anecdote to it with cleverness and artistry
 kissa sunate-sunaate raat biit jaati
 The emperor was so immersed in the tales that the rest of his part would give Shahzadi one more time to live to hear the next night
 is tarah din par din bitate chale gaye
 The king eventually forgives that wise princess
 yah akelaa prasang hi kisse kii takat kaa andaaj karaane ke liye paryaapt he
 However, this anecdote also casts sarcasm on the lifestyle and infamy of the emperors
 germany kii lokkathaon ko sankalit karne ke liye grim-bandhuon ke prayaas kii saraahna duniya-bhar main hui he
 The folklore compiled by him is compiled in a book called Jagatprasiddha 'grimms Fairy Tales'
 kahaniyon ko jutaney liye grim bandhuon ne germany ke gaanv-gaanv jaakar bujurgon se kahaniyaan suni thim
 In this connection there is a very interesting incident which is mentioned by the Grimm brothers as their experiences during the compilation of stories that 


 Once they reach a village there they are told about a witch old lady Told in jiske paas gaanvvaale apane bacchon ko bhejne se kataraate the
 Someone also informed them that the old lady has an immense wealth of stories
 parantu saath hi yah bhi bataa diya ki vah ‘jaaduugarani or dian he
 There is a chauder who casts such a spell on children that children scream and cry in the night with scary dreams
 ’ grim-bandhu kahaniyon kii khoj main nikle the
 So they reached the old lady and requested her to tell the story
 jawaab main budhiya ne shart laga di ki vah kahani tabhi suna sakati he, jab shrota ke rup main vahaan bachche bhi upasthit hon
 On the other hand, the villagers were not ready to send their children to the old lady
 isse grim-bandhuon ke saamne vikat samasya upasthit ho gai
 The old lady was stubborn
 lokkathaon ke moh main grim bandhu bhi vahaan se niraash lautne ko taiyaar nahin the
 The Grimm brothers eventually enlisted the help of one of their friends
 usne gaanvvaalon ko samajhaayaa
 They also assured the safety of their children
 antat kaaphi prayaas ke baad, gaanvvaale apane bacchon ko budhiya ke paas bhejne ko raji ho gaye
 The victim of the harassment of the villagers for years, away from the village and living alone, the eyes of the old woman shone as soon as they saw the children
 vah kahani sunaane ko taiyaar ho gai
 And then as soon as the old lady started the first anecdote, the Grimm brothers along with the children were also enchanted
 uski kahani sunaane kala itani adbhut or romaanchak thi ki kuch der ke liye sab apana aapa bhuulane lage
 While narrating the story, sometimes she would growl like a lion and sometimes she would start twittering like a bird
 kahani main billi kaa zikr aate hi vah jhat se miaun-miaun karne lagati
 Not only this, the old lady with her voice was adept at producing such a loud soundtrack like thunder, rain, thunder clouds
 uske kahan main jaadui prabhaav tha
 As long as the old lady told the stories, they kept listening hypnotically
 uske baad grim bandhuon kii samaj main sara rahasy aa gaya
 Through effective presentation of the event, the old man used to create such lively images that the characters and events of the children would start to feel real and penetrate directly into their hearts and minds
 unka asar bhi der tak rahata
 Due to which they would get scared in dreams
 apane is anubhav kaa varnan grim-bandhuon ne vistaar se kiya he
 They write that we have made the children sit in front of that old lady and we ourselves sat behind the curtain in an equal room
 budhiya kahaniyaan sunaane lagi or hamane unhen lipibaddh karnaa shuru kar diya
 grimm-bandhu writes that 'when the old lady started telling the story, we realized that she was probably the best storyteller in the world who specializes in the art of storytelling
 

vah varsha, aandhi, jaanwaron, chidiyon aadi ke dhwani-prabhaav apane munh se paidaa karti or kahani ko atyadhik prabhaavshaalee bana detii
 The magic of this story art was that magic; Which used to dominate the minds and minds of children
 usee ke prabhaav ke kaaran ve sapanom main un chitron ko saakaar dekhakar dar jate the
 'the villagers, ignorant of this secret, used to disgust and stigmatize the old lady as a sorceress, witch, witch, etc
 is bare main ham sabhi ekamat hai ki bachche kahaniyaan padhane ke bajaae praayah unako sunanaa adhik pasand karte hai
 There is no pressure on the child's mind while listening to the story as it is often while reading
 isliye vah kahani or usamen nihit sandesh ko aatmsaat karata hua chalata he
 Some such incidents of the story, the personality of the characters in it, etc
 keep developing in its psyche
 antarangta ke gun ke kaaran hi balpathak un rachanaaon kii prati adhik lagaav rakhata he jo uske man kii baat ko baatcheet ke andaaj main uske aamane-saamne baithkar kii jaati hai
 Therefore, this style is not only the most liked by the boys but it also has the scope of using the most for the author
 is kaaran vahi baalsahityakar adhik lokapriy hue hai jinhone kissagoi ko samasamyik sandarbhon ke saath jodate hue sahitya rachana kii he
 Being in direct communication with the readers, there is a natural flow in his work
 acha kissago apane shrotaaon ko baandhe rakhane ke liye chitratmakataa or naatakeeyata kaa sahaara letaa he
 In textbooks, there is usually an external pressure to assimilate knowledge
 jo balak ke man main tanaav kii paidaa karata he
 From which he tries to run away from textbooks
 ek or sach yah bhi he ki pathyapustakon main praayah gaveshnatmak style kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 The study style also gets progressively more complex depending on the subject
 jisase balak ko baraabar yah ehsaas bana rahata he ki use sikhaaya yaa padhaayaa ja rahaa he
 Someone who wants to take him to a particular direction
 

uski swatantrata main avarohak bana he
 

first for education, his psyche reads books with some compulsion but at the same time the urge to avoid them, the desire to run away from them, a prohibition towards didacticism also keeps on popping in his mind
 kissago kaa apnatv tathaa kissagoi style main uplabdh rachanaaen use gyaan or prastutikaran kii ekresata se ubaarti hai
 In other styles of communication, there exists a duality between the writer and the reader
 jisase pathak rachana kaa puraa ras nahin le paata
 To him, that composition seems to be imposed from above
 kissagoi bachche ko romani duniya main le jane kaa sabase kaamyaab madhyam he
 In this, there is the essence of imagination, not unnecessary pressure of intellect, therefore, this style of communication is especially liked by children
 yahaan gyaan sahitya kii ek shart ke rup main rachana main maujuud to hota he kintu vah itnaa pranjal or chipa-chipa-sa hota he ki pathak use aahista se bina kisi dabaav yaa aahat ke grahan karata chalaa jaataa he
 Knowledge becomes interesting and receptive through imagination
 ek baat aarope kii tarah kahi ja sakati he ki kissagoi pradhan rachanaaon main kalpana kaa aadhiky hota he
 Which takes the listener or reader beyond reality
 sambhawatah isi kaaran kamiks, chitrakthaon aadi main kissagoi kaa failaav adhik hua he
 Tremendous fantasy epics and Greek legends have also received criticism despite being interesting due to the predominance of this genre
 lekin kalpana sadaiv hi buree or tyajya nahin hoti
 Aristotle believes that even in every imaginary creation, the fundamental truth remains
 yahi kaaran he ki kissagoi style ko manoranjan ke saath-saath saamaajik mulyon ke sampreshan hetu bhi apanaaya jaataa rahaa he
 Even today, the insistence on culture and traditions and the emphasis on taking inspiration from it, it is certain that the importance of storytelling in literature and folk life will remain equal, not only to remain but also in new experiments, There will also be plenty of possibilities for inventions

 adventure game ek computer-aadhaarit game he jisamen shaareerik chunauti kii bajaae anveshan or paheli ko sulajhane ke dwaara sanchalit ek sanvadatmak kahani hoti he jisamen khilaadi ko mukhya nayak mana jaataa he
 Its genre focuses on storytelling that allows it to be adapted from other story-based media such as literature and film and is surrounded by a wide variety of literary genres
 lagbhag sabhi adventure game kaa dizin ek ekal khilaadi ke liye hi hota he, kyonki kahani or charitron par bal dene ke kaaran bahu-khilaadiyon ke liye game dizin karnaa kaaphi kathin ho jaataa he
 In the Western world, the style's popularity rose during the late 1980s and mid-1990s, when many believed it to be the most technologically advanced style and is now sometimes considered a niche style
 duusari taraf east asia main, drishy upanyaas ke rup main adventure game kii lokapriyata jari he, jo japan main jari lagbhag 70% pisi game kii kshatipurti karti he
 The term "adventure game" has its origins in the 1970s computer game adventure, which became a precursor to a genre of gameplay that was widely copied and a genre in itself
 isiilie saahitiyik style ke vipareet, video game style apane gemple dwaara paribhaashit hoti he, kyonki saahitiyik style us vishay ke anusaar paribhaashit hoti he jo ise sambodhit karti he, jo ki adventure kriya hoti he
 Essential elements of the genre include story, exploration and puzzle solving
 adventure game ko paheli ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he jo katha dhaanche main sannihit he jahaan game main "katha saamagree shaamil he jise ek khilaadi charan dar charan kholta jaataa he
 "while the puzzles that players receive through the story may be one-sided, in which the players do not get out of the story they are considered to be examples of good design
 adventure game main yuddh or ection chunautiyaan kaaphi kam yaa nahin hoti hai, jo unhen ection game se alag karata he
 In the book Andrew Rowlings and Ernest Adams on Game Design, the author stated that "this does not mean that there is no dispute in the adventure game 


 but it is important that war is not a primary activity
" " kuch adventure game anya video game style se ek minigem ko shaamil karenge, jisaki shuddhtavaadiyon ke dwaara hameshaa saraahna nahin kii jaati he
 Of course, there are some games in which there is a mix of action and adventure from beginning to end
 is prakaar ke mishrit ection adventure game main shuddh adventure game ke mukaable adhik shaareerik chunautiyaan hoti he, saath hi saath tej gati bhi hoti he
 This definition is quite difficult to apply, however, which game is an action game and involves debates among designers about how many non-physical challenges would be considered as action-adventure
 adventure game role-plaing video game se bhi alag hota he jisamen ection, team nirmaan or point prabandhan shaamil hote hai
 Adventure games lack numerical rules or the relationships seen in role-playing games, and sometimes have an internal economy
 in gemon main kaushal pranali, yuddh kii kami hoti he yaa "virdohi ko ranneeti or yuddh kaushal se haraane kii kami hoti he
 "however, some mix games exist, where role-playing games with strong narrative and puzzle elements are considered rpg-adventures
 antat adventure game ko paheli game se alag vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 Although an adventure game may involve a Peele Plow, they typically involve a player-controlled avatar in an interactive-story
 adventure gemon main vibhinn prakaar kii paheliyaan shaamil hoti hai, jaise sandeshon ko dicode karnaa, chizon ko praapt karnaa or istemaal karnaa, band daravaaje ko kholana, yaa nae sthanon ko paanaa or khoj karnaa shaamil hai
 The puzzle solving game opens up access to new areas of the world and reveals other stories in the game
 tark paheliyaan, jahaan khilaadi ke nigamanaatmak tark kaushal ke pareekshan ke liye kaalpanik interphes ke saath yantric upkarnon kaa dizin hota he, ve saadhaaran hote hai
 Some riddles have been criticized for their ambiguity, for example in The Longest Journey using a combination of fabric rope, clamps and a pair of rubber glued to assemble, which is out of the game's storyline and the player's Only creates a constraint
 khilaadiyon ko andhavat andaja kii aavashyaktaa ke liye, sahi pixel par clic karne ke dwaara yaa game main sahi kriya kaa andaja ke dwaara jo ki ek paath interphes kaa istemaal karti he, ke liye anyon kii aalochana kii jaati rahi he
 Games that require players to navigate to crooked routes are less popular, although early text-adventure games usually required players to map if they wanted to navigate imaginary locations
 kai adventure gemon main pruthak gemple mod ke rup main ek vishisht prabandhan screen kaa upyog karte hai khilaadi game main keval kuch vastuon ko praapt karne main sakasham hote hai, isliye aamtaur par khilaadi jaanate hai ki keval ek vastu praapt karnaa mahatvapurn hota he
 Because if they forget an important object it can be difficult for the player to know it, they will often clear each scene for the object
 game ke liye vah point-and-clic upkaran kaa istemaal karte hai, kabhi-kabhi khilaadi vyavasthit khoj main sanlagn ho jaaenge, jise pixel hunt ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The game tries to avoid them by exposing objects or snapping the player's cursor to the object
 kuch vastuon ko aksar vibhinn adventure gemon main chitrit kiya jaataa he or kai prakaar se prayog kiya jaataa he
 Two examples are rope and a crowbar
 Some items are used as part of ongoing gimmicks, for example in many inconsistent situations away from their original intended purpose
 in gemon kii kai paheliyon main ekatrikaran or unke vastu suchi se saamagree kaa prayog shaamil he
 Players must apply lateral thinking techniques where they apply external knowledge in the real world about objects in unexpected ways
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek gulel kaa nirmaan karne ke liye ek cactus par chipka hua ek inner daalane ke dwaara, jisamen ek khiladi ko yah mahasoos hona chahie ki vah bhitari tub lacheela he
 They may need to be off their inventory for a long time before they can prove useful, and thus it is normal to test the memory of adventure game players where some of the information pre-game information has The challenge can be met
 isamen kabhi kabhaar hi in paheliyon ke liye samay seemaa kaa dabaav hota he or tej soch kii bajaae khilaadiyon ke tark pratibha par dhyaan diya jaataa he
 Adventure Game is a single-player experience that is most driven by the story
 kisi bhi anya style se adhik, adventure game apane kahaniyon or samaayojan par nirbhar hota he or sammohak ekal khilaadi anubhav kaa nirmaan karata he
 They are usually adjusted in a meditative environment, often a fictional world, and try to change the segment-by-segment adjustment to add to the novelty and create interest in the experience
 kamedi ek aam vishay he or jab khilaadi aise ection karte hai yaa sangyojan karte hai jo ki "haasyaaspad or asambhav" hote hai tab aksar game main haasyaaspad pratikriyaaon ko likhaa jaataa he
 Ever since adventure games are driven by storytelling, the development of characters usually follows literary conventions of personal and emotional development rather than new powers or abilities
 khilaadi aksar ek khoj main sammilat hote hai, yaa ek rahasy ko sulajhane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he yaa aisi sthiti jiske bare main alp jaankaree hoti he
 These kinds of mystical stories allow designers to deal with problems of this type called Ernest Adams "problem of Amnesia", where the player controls the main character but has to start the game without his knowledge and experience 
 kahani ghatnaayen aam taur par prakat hoti he kyonki khilaadi nai chunautiyon yaa paheliyon ko puraa kar letaa he, lekin vaise kahaniyon ko kam yantric banane ke kram main khilaadiyon ke chaal ke dwaara kahani main nae tatwon ko sakriy kiya ja saktaa he
 Adventure games have a strong storyline with significant dialogue and sometimes effective use of recorded dialogue or events from the voice actors
 game kii is style ko ek vaartalap vriksh ke rup main samvaad kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa janaa jaataa he
 Players are able to engage a non-player character through selecting a sentence from a previously written dialog from the menu, thereby activating a response from the game character
 in vaartalapon kaa dizin aksar ek vriksh sanrachana ke rup main hota he, jahaan samvaad kii prayek shakha ke bich khilaadi aage badhane kaa faisla karata he
 However, there is always a limited number of branches to follow and some adventure games are degraded by selecting each option one after the other
 pahaliyon ko kaise suljhaayaa jaae iske bare main suraag kaa pataa charitron ke saath baatcheet karne se chal saktaa he, jisamen khilaadi ke saath sahyog karne se pehle charitra kya chaahate hai iske bare main sanket shaamil he
 Other conversations have far-reaching conclusions, such as the decision to expose an important mystery that is assigned to the player
 charitron ko vaartalap yaa unhen aisa kuch dena jo ki unke liye laabhakaari ho, ke madhyam se upane rahasyon kaa pardaaphos karne ke liye aashwasht bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 The primary goal in the adventure game is to complete the assigned quest
 praarambhik adventure gemon main aksar ucch score or kuch hota tha, jaise jork ke rup main, saath hi khilaadiyon ko ek rank diya jaataa tha, jo ki unke score par aadhaarit ek paath vivaran hota tha
 The high score provided the player with a secondary goal, and is given an indication of progress
 jabaki ucch score ab kam saamaanya he, exbox live uplabdhi jaise atirikt puraskaar pranali ek sadrush bhoomika kaa pradarshan karti he
 The primary failure condition in the adventure game is the player's death, which is derived from relatively more action-oriented games
 anya shaileyon ke spasht dushmano kii pahchaan ke bina, adventure gemon main ise shaamil kiya janaa vivaadaaspad hota he or kai developers ab yaa to isse bachate hai yaa mrityu ko suchit karne se pehle atirikt kadam uthaate hai
 In some early adventure games, players are implicated in incompetent situations to win, without the game ending
 infocom ke text adventure da hichikar guide tu da gelexi ke drishy yojana ke liye aalochana kii jaati rahi he jahaan game kii shuruuaat main hi junk mail ke gatthar ko uthaane main khilaadi ke naakaam hone se bachaane ke liye game ke samaapt hone ke kaaphi pehle hi game ko roak diya jaataa he
 Text adventure is also known as interactive fiction, the game's story is communicated through a paragraph of text, told to the player in response to written instructions
 praarambhik text adventure jaise adventure, "hugo house of horer" or scot adams game main in nirdeshon kii vyakhya saral kriya-sangya pad vyakhyayitr ke istemaal se kiya jaataa he or buniyadi str par khilaadi ko vastuon se baatcheet karne kii anumati di jaati he, jaise "get kii" yaa "open door" ko likhane ke dwaara
 baad main text adventure or aadhunik interactive kalpana, adhik jatil vaakyon kii vyakhya kar sakate hai
 Graphic Adventure is an adventure game in which the use of graphics is communicated to the environment for the player
 graphic adventure binar ke tahat game main text pad vyakhyayitr se tach screen interphes tak vibhinn prakaar ke input ho sakate hai
 Point-and-click adventure is a common type of graphic adventure in which the player uses a pointer and usually a mouse to solve the environment and puzzles
 yah input vidhi, style main lokapriy he or yah paryaavaran ke saath baatcheet ke liye kaaphi anukool he, kyonki yah pratyaksh niyantran yojanaon kaa virodh karata he jo ki charitra niyantran par jor detaa he
 Graphic adventure games will vary in how they present the avatar
 kuch gemon main pratham-vyakti yaa tisare-vyakti pariprekshya kaa upyog karenge jahaan camere khiladiyon kii chaal kaa peechha karte hai, jabaki kai adventure game main prakaran-samvedansheel camaron kaa istemaal karte hai jinhen prayek sthaan kaa sarvshereshth prabhaav dikhaane ke liye upyukt sthanon par lagaaya jaataa he
 Puzzle adventures are thrill games that place great emphasis on the first solution at the expense of elements such as object aggregation, object experimentation, character interaction, or plot
 iske bajaay, ve aamtaur par khoj or jatil prakriya ke uchit prayog se gupt arth ko prakat karte hai, jo ki aksar rub goldvarg mashin ke samaan hoti he
 The plot of these games is unclear and can be communicated through the interplay of riddles
 kai paheli adventure ko pratham purush pariprekshya se hi khelaa jaataa he, jisamen purv-prastut 3D chhaviyon ke bich khilaadi "gatiman" hota he, jo kabhi-kabhi chote anemation yaa videon ke saath sanyojit hota he
 Examples of the genre include Shism, Atlantis: The Lost Tales, Riddle of the Sphinx, Zack & Wiki: Quest for Barbaros' Treasure, and Mist, which led the game
 paheli adventure kaa ek prakaar kamare se bacho up-style he, jo ki chote game yukt hote hai jahaan ekmaatr vastu kamare se baahar nikalne ke raste ko talashta he
 These games are usually implemented in a graphic point-and-click style, often on the Adobe Flash format
 up-style ke udaahranon main sabamshin-series, mistary of time and spes or crimsom room shaamil hai
 The visual novel is an adventure game with mostly irreversible graphics, usually anime-style art
 jaisaa ki naam se ingit ho saktaa he, ve mishrit-media upanyaas yaa sajiv chitra manch naatak ke sadrush hote hai
 Visual novels are especially prevalent in Japan, where they cater to about 70% of PC games released
 video game consol ke liye ve shaayad hi kabhi nirmit hote hai, lekin sarvaadhik lokapriy game ko drimcast yaa plastesan 2 jaise system main bheja jaataa he
 Although visual novels are limited in markets outside East Asia
 kai myanon main drishy upanyaas, japani adventure game ke saath ativyapt hote hai, jisamen sabhi nevigation or sampark ke liye ek menu-aadhaarit itarphes sahit ICOM game kaa samaranshil shaamil he
 Japanese adventure games rarely involve on-screen avatars or general list-based puzzles, and in the visual novel there is even less emphasis on riddles or indeed games
 iske bajaay ye sheershak katha dwaara gatiman hote hai, chooj yor on adventure story ke sadrush ek sanrachana main charitron ke baatcheet par vishesh taur par dhyaan kendrit kiya jaataa he
 Visual novels often feature romantic narratives in which the main character may end up with one of several potential peers
 yah aadhaar dating sims ke sadrush he, lekin ve unase alag hai, unamem sakhyikee-aadhaarit sim tatwon kii kami hoti he jisamen khilaadi apane charitra ko khadaa karata he or isaki bajaae samvaad, ection yaa nevigation ke saral vikalpon par bharosa karata he
 The visual novel is a staple of PC software sales in Japan and other East Asian countries for more than a decade, which is why popular titles have been consoled and even some popular manga and anime series are based on them: titles like that Kanon, Air and Clanad by Ki; Rumbling Hurts and School Days by Age; Higurashi no naku koro ni by 07th extension; Includes Fate / Stay Night by type-moon
 drishy upanyaas ko pashchim main kabhi-kabhi "dating sims" kaha jaataa he, kyonki kai drishy upanyaas aankade ko trek karte he jo ki khilaadi ko sajeesh se pehle ke kram main khadaa karnaa chahie
 This is also because many visual novels allow for types of endings and more dynamic responses to the player's action rather than a common linear adventure plot
 pashchami or japani adventure game ke bich saanskrithik antar role-plaing game ke un chizon ke saath kaaphi nikat he, jaise katha raikhik or baad main likhi majboot-patakatha ke rup main
 The first adventure game was seen as a text adventure, in which the verb-noun phrase is usually used to communicate with the user
 inkaa vikaas hunt da wompus or adventure jaise praarambhik menfrem sheershakon dwaara vyavsaayik game main hua, jise infocom ke vyapak rup se lokapriy zork series jaise personal computer par khelaa jaataa tha
 Some companies played a major role in bringing the adventure game without text, which included Adventure International, Infocomm, Label 9 Computing, Magnetic Scrolls and Melbourne House, in which Infocom is quite popular
 puraane adventure game kii kahani aisi hoti thi jaise swayan khilaadi ne game world basaai ho
 No detailed information about the protagonist in the game was made explicit, allowing the player to visualize him or herself as an avatar
 1970 ke dashak ke madhya main programmer, surang or role-player wiliam crouther ne ek program kaa vikaas kiya jise adventure ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Beranek and Newman, an employee of Crowther, Bolt, used the company's PDP-10 to produce the game, which required 300 kilobytes of memory
 ek bhumigat surang pranali ke madhyam se ek interactive adventure kaa nirmaan karne ke liye game main text antarfalak kaa prayog kiya gaya, jo ki kentuki main mumoth surang pranali ke ek hisse par aadhaarit tha
 Crowther's work was later revised and expanded by programmer Don Woods at Stanford using the SAIL computer, and the game became wildly popular among early computer emitters and spread throughout the fledgling ARPANET in the late 1970s
 yathartwaadee gupha vivaran or ootpataang tatwon ke sangyojan ne behad aakarshak sabit kiya or dashakon ke liye adventure game style ko paribhaashit kiya
 Swords, magic words, objects involved in riddles, and vast underground spaces, all became prominent in the text adventure genre
 microcomputing muvament gen steam ke rup main "armcheir adventure" jaldi hi mahavidhyalay parisaron se pare fail gai
 Many forms of adventure appeared in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including the re-christen Colossal Adventure or some later versions of Colossal Cave
 colozal kev ke kai prashansakon main se ek programmer scot adams bhi the
 Adams spent nearly ten days deciding on the game for his first start in Adventure before acquiring the Adventure Grandmaster States, a title bestowed on him who appropriately scores 350 in the Crowther and Woods version
 ek baar game ko puraa karne ke baad adams aashcharya main pade ki unke TRS-80 kii tarah adventure jaise game kaa vikaas ek home computer main kaise kiya ja saktaa he
 The main obstacle was that in fact home computers like the TRS-80 do not have enough memory to run large games like Adventure
 Adams worked on these limitations through high-level language development and Interpreter written in BASIC, which would allow this approach to reuse the code for additional adventure game development
 1978 main adams apni patni alexis ke saath uske game kii bikri ke kram main international adventure kii sthapana kii
 Their first game Adventureland was a version of Adventure for the TRS-80 that became the first commercial adventure game to sell

 By their third game Mission Impossible, Adams introduced programming in the assembly language to increase the speed of his software

 In 1982, David Peigh discovered print of the original source code for an adventure game taken at ARPNET during a visit to his Stanford computer lab
 us samay, ve washington ke tacoma main computer retailor computerland par kaam kar rahe the
 David Pegg modified the original program content so that it would run on all computers sold by the Computerland Company, to provide special facilities for potential customers
 He provided each customer with the magic word of the backdoor to go to different locations in the game
 jiskaa kutashabd "XYZZY" tha
 "the adventure game continued as a free program until it was passed on to commercial retail locations and was given free to any customer who purchased a computer from it

 Dave Labeling and Mark Blanc were students of mit's lab for computer science when they discovered the Crowther and Woods adventure

 Upon graduation, the students, along with their leader Albert Veza, decided to open a company to market Zork for home computers, and on June 22, 1979, Tim Anderson, Joel Berez, Mark Blanc, Mike Bruce, Scott Cutler, Stu Geely, Dave Labeling, J

 He solved this problem by dividing the game into three episodes and developing ZIL, which could be used on any computer using Infocomm's Z-machine, the first to use commercial products as intermediaries

 That same year, Bruce Daniels finalized the Apple II version and sold over 6000 additional copies

 The company continued to develop text adventure games, even opening a department for the development of professional software, a department that was never profitable
 vishaal, budhimaan kathanak, apratim vaakyavinyas vishleshak or game ke abhinn rup main kushal pralekhan ke saath ucch gunvattta vaale game sabhi shaileyon main safalataa praapt kii
 Author Douglas Adams produced two games with infocomm, based on his Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series and the lesser-known adventure game called Bureaucracy, inspired by the problems faced in dynamic homes
 microcomputer kii badhati shakti or graphics kii maang ke saath, infocom ne bikri main giravat ko mahasoos kiya or 1989 main acteveshan dwaara nigal jane ke baad infocom shakha main, apane charam main 100 karmchaariyon kii tulana main keval das karmchaaree hi rah gaye
 However, later titles were marketed under the Infocom brand and the Infocom branch was closed and the game developed after 1989 but had no connection with the original team
 infocom ke band hone ne interactive kalpana kii vyavsaayik yatra kii samaapti ko suchit kiya or 1989 ke baad pad vyakhyayitron ko bahut kam hi dekha gaya
 Despite this, a low barrier to entry ensures that the lively and creative community of IF writers continues to flourish on the Internet, using language such as Inform, which allows the generated file to be read from infocom's own Z-machine Can
 graphics kii shuruuaat on-line systams naamak company dwaara 1980 main hui thi, jisane baad main apana naam badal kar sierra on-line rakhaa
 In the early graphic adventure of Sierra, such as Mystery House, basic vector graphics were used, but soon these professional artists replaced bitmap graphics
 iske udaahranon main stuart smith dwaara ritern of heracals, , sherwood forest, del joneson ke muskired, antonio antiosia ke tronsylvania, sierra ke kings kpaschim or adventure construction set jo ki electronic arts kaa praarambhik hit he, shaamil hai
 In the 1980s, a number of games were released in the 8-bit home computer format, which is an advanced version of the text adventure genre, and originated from games such as Colossal Cave Adventure and Sierra-like games, including the term interpreter or Similar to the traditional adventure has been added to the input system
 iskaa udhaaharan gargoyal game kaa heavi on da magic he jisamen animated disple screen ke saath text input pranali he or baad ke spelbound jaise magic nite game jisamen text adventure style input kii anumati ke liye vindo-menu pranali kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 After the launch of Apple Macintosh in 1984 with a point-and-click interface, a new type of game emerged
 The first to be released the same year was the new but relatively unknown Invented Skipper, then in 1985 ICOM Simulation released Déjà Vu which ejected the text parser in favor of a point-and-click interface
 1987 main duusare pholo-ap main prasiddh shedoget ko jari kiya gaya or meniek menson jo ki ek point-and-clic adventure tha jisane baad main majbooti pai, ke saath lukasarts bhi is kshetra main daakhil ho chukaa tha
 a prime example of lucasarts work is the Monkey Iceland series

 Through playing adventure on the teletype terminal and unable to find many examples of the inexperienced genre, Roberta Williams found her own fantasy, a detective story that was set to feature Augusta Christie's novel And Give There Were Nuns and the board game Clu's Was inspired by non-linear gameplay
 iske dizin par ek maheene ke liye kaam karne ke baad, vah apane pati ken williams ko FORTRAN sankalak par kaam na karne ke liye raji karne main sakasham hui, jo ki apane apple II computer par game par kaam karne ke kram main develping kar rahaa tha
 Originally known as a high-race adventure, Mystery House was the first graphic adventure game, and featured vector graphics of each environment with a simple two-word parser
 mistary house kii jam kar bikri hui or haalanki ken kaa maananaa tha ki peshewar software bazaar kii tulana main vikasshil bazaar kaa gaming bazaar kam hoga, vah or roberta game ke saath lage rahe
 Thus, in 1980 Williams built the on-line system, which later became the Sierra on-line
 jaldi hi siyara aage badhane laga
 By this time, Adventure was the first person in the game; Images were introduced as decoration through the eyes of the player
 williams company ne kings kpaschim shrinkhalaa main ek or visheshta kii shuruyaat karenge: tisare vyakti main ek game
 ection game main viksit takneekon kaa laabh uthaaya gaya jo ki samanaantar rup se pragati main tha, ken ne ek anemated paatr kii shuruuaat kii jo game main khilaadi kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or jisase khilaadi niyantrit hota he
 a new standard was created with 3D animated adventure and almost all industries adopted it
 Commands were still entered on the keyboard and analyzed by syntax analysis, as in the text adventure game
 iske turant baad, sierra ke paas chal rahe adventure game ke safal shrinkhlaayein thi jisamen prayek main kai sankhyaon main game ke saath kings quest, polis quest, spes quest, lizar suut leri or hero quest shaamil hai
 These series were launched a few years later, with the classic graphics above the command cursor completely replaced with "point and click" game play and VGA graphics
 anya ullekhneey shrinkhalaaon main phantasamgoriya or shivars shaamil he; sierra kaa antim or samikshakon dwaara sabase bahuprashansit shrinkhalaa gabriel nite shrinkhalaa tha, jisaki shuruuaat 1993 main hui or 1999 main sierra ke antim adventure game ke saath samaapt hui
 Sierra developed a new game and pushed the boundaries of adventure gaming until it was purchased by Sentient in 1998
 Then in 1998, Sendant sold its entire interactive software arm to Havas Interactive for $ 1 billion, a subsidiary of Vivendi Universal
 siyara ne apane game ke liye praudyogiki ko jari rakhaa jo ki us samay kaa sabase unnat style thi
 However, the adventure game era came to an end with the release of playstation; As 3D became the most effective graphic format and most of the 2D adventure market began to retreat

 Japan's oldest visual novel and a graphic adventure game at the earliest was Chanzoft's 1983 Murder Mystery Game Portopia Renzoko Satsujin Jiken by Yuji Horo
 portapia renzoko satsugin jiken ko pratham-vyakti pariprekshya main dekha gaya jisamen pratham-vyakti katha hota tha or color graphic kaa pehla adventure game tha
 Chansoft later went on to produce the sound novel for the adventure game, including Kamitachi no Yoro, Machi, and more recently 428: Fūsa Sareta Shibuya de
 baad main video game udyog main pravesh karne or baad main swayan ke graphic adventure banane ke liye portapia hideu kojima se prerit hua jaise snechar, policenots or Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel

 Prior to the Nintendo DS, the Dreamcast and playstation 2 had several other Japanese adventure games released in the West, for example Shega's Shenmue and Konami's Shadow of Memories
 However, these were not visual novels but were in lieu of 3D third-person adventure games, unlike most 2D or 3D first-person performances of the time
 yadhyapi adhikansh japani adventure game graphical rahe hai, yahan kai text-aadhaarit adventure game bhi he
 One such example is Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Hōseki as a guide to the Chrono series of console role-playing games
 japani adventure game kaa drishy upanyaas ek vishisht rup he, jisamen aise kai paramparaayen shaamil he jo ki pashchim main kam lokapriy he
 They are almost universally first-person and primarily driven by dialogue
 ve bhi point or clic lagu karne jo ki pashchami gemon se thodaa alag hota he, ke saath menu ke aadhaar par sampark or nevigation kaa upyog karte hai
 The kinds of inventory-based puzzles that are based on the classic Western adventure are extremely rare
 mist main paae jane vaali tark paheliya asaamaanya hote hai
 For this reason, Japanese visual novels are quite streamlined and often very easy, relying more on the story rather than the challenge to increase the players' interest
 1987 main ron gilbert naam kaa ek programmer lucasfilm games company ke liye kaam karata tha - tabase uskaa naam lukasarts padaa - jisane patakatha lekhan pranali SCUMM kaa nirmaan kiya jisamen ICOM simulation maceventure games ke sadrush point-and-clic itarphes kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, pehali baar iskaa anaavaran 1985 main kiya gaya
 Instead of typing commands in the syntax analyzer, the system was controlled by means of a text symbol
 apane paryaavaran ke saath baatcheet ke liye khilaadi ek aadesh ko apni suchi par ek chhavi pratinidhitiv karata hua iken yaa chhavi ke ek hisse main clic karata he
 This approach was first used by lucasarts to good effect in the Meniac Menson game
 lukasarts adventure game ke kuch avadharanaon par punarvichaar karne or khel main kuch sudhaar karne ke dwaara apane aap ko apane mukhya pratidwandvi vishaal sierra se alag kiya
 The possibility of dying during the game was eliminated and every effort was made to ensure that the player never completely collapsed
 Finally, lucasarts abandoned the numeral system by indicating the player's progress in the adventure, many of the other companies' adventure games followed these changes by lucasarts
 meniek menson or zak mccracan and elien mindbenders main gilbert ne prayaas kiye haalanki ise 16 color main rakhaa or point-and-clic ingine main tab bhi text parsing ke avshesh the, tabase khilaadi ko tab bhi vaakyon kaa vinyas game ke chhaviyon ke saath clic karne yogya kunjeeshbdon kaa istemaal karte hue karnaa hoga
 The work was completed at The Secret of Monkey Iceland with 256 colors, a state-of-the-art point-and-click engine, dialogue with optional responses, puzzle solving with items, original graphics, ambient music and a special-tempered spirit
 uparokt sabhi ke alaava patakatha ko ek film ke rup main likhaa gaya tha or samvaad or suchi patakatha kii aavashyaktaa ko bataata he
 The release of Day of the Tentacle in 1993 was a notable success and the beginning of a cartoon-style game, including the impressive Sam & Max hit The Road as well as the famous Full Throttle, which marked the end of the golden age of adventure games Was also the messenger of the beginning
 da dig ke nirmaan main lukasarts ke saath steven spilberg juden - ek vigyaan galp adventure game jise nirdeshak ne film main roopantaran karne kii kalpana kii thi
 Benefiting from the progress of the action game and the integration of those engines similar to first-person shooters, the company took a new turn with the Grim Phendongo game in 1998, where it introduced a cartoon-style new 3D game system called grime
 And SCUMM left the scripting environment
 escape from monki iceland ke 2000 jari karne ke baad lukasarts ne aath varsh se bhi adhik tak koi adventure game kaa prakaashan nahin kiya or phool throtal or sam and maiks ke sikval ko radd kar diya gaya jinka vikaas kaary jari tha
 It was the first developer to develop a CD-ROM later than Cyanne
 His first game was a simple children's adventure game called The Manhole, which became the first computer game to use the medium in 1989
 1993 main, sien ne mist jari kii, jo ki ek pratham-vyakti adventure tha or jisamen purv main prastut kiye gaye teen-aiami graphics, video or audio ke liye CD-ROM kii atirikt storage kshamta kaa istemaal kiya
 Despite the first game being published on CD-ROM, a CD-ROM drive was required, which would make the game quite successful
 koi spasht lakshyon ke bina, thodaa vaiyaktik yaa vastu antah kriya or anveshan par kaaphi jor or vaigyanik or yantric pahaliyon ke saath us samay ke liye mist ek asaamaanya game tha
 Part of the game's success was that it did not seem to target the teenage male audience, but instead seemed to target a mainstream adult audience
 mist ne computer game bikri ke saat saal kaa record banaaya - sabhi platformon par nau million pratiyaan bechi gai - 2000 main da sims ke jari hone tak yah asaadhaaran kaam ko maat nahin diya gaya tha
 In the 1980s, adventure games designed for computers were the most popular
 lekin 1990 ke dashak ke madhya main is kii lokapriyata main jabardast giravat ai or is kii jagah america bazaar main ection games ne apni jagah bana lee, khaas taur par first parasan shooters jaise duum or half-life bahut lokapriy hue jo dhire-dhire apni pakad majboot banaate gaye, is kaa mukhya kaaran yah tha ki in games kii kahaniyaan acchhee tarah likhi gai thi or is kaa dhaancha solo games kii tarah tha
 Due to the decline in popularity of adventure games, for many publishers and game makers, making adventure games proved more of a loss deal than producing other games
 adventure kahaniyon kaa bhi kuch yahi haal hua, lekin iske saadhaaran hone kii vajah se gaiyr vyapaarik taur par sanvadatmak kahaniyon ko badhaava mila
 Although very few current adventure games have been commercially successful in America, but the games are still very popular in Europe
 It is believed that gamers, on average, are used to console video games and want to enjoy the game as a first-person shooter rather than traditional adventure computer games
 duusare kaaran main kaha gaya ki mmorpgs, jo bahu khilaadi sansar kaa prastaav detaa he, usne aanshik taur par game kii style main badlaav laayaa he
 The other possible reason for the decline in adventure games is 3D graphics, as much of the graphics in the 90s and early 2000s should have been given more attention to fast activity rather than detailed descriptions
 is ke vipareet agar games main adhik jaankaree ke saath-saath sthir chitra kaa prayog kiya jaataa to ise takneekee taur par prayaavarsi mana ja saktaa he
 In such an era, there are many questions about whether adventure games will be able to regain popularity even in this age of change in technology
 adventure games jo kabhi bahut lokapriy hua karata tha us kii jagah ab duusare games ne le lee he or sierra antertenment or lookasarts jaisi badi-badi companiyaan yaa to lupt ho gai hai yaa phir unhone duusare prakaashan main apana haath daal diya hai, jise duusari companiyaan viksit karti hai
 Despite all this, the process of producing adventure games continues in the 2000s, especially in North America where the genre of the game is still very popular
 phunkaam nami company dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya da languest jarney, or emerzone or siberia, jiskaa sankalpana benite sokaal ne taiyaar kiya tha or vikaas microids ne kiya tha, yah donon hi games shandaar quality kaa he or jaankaar ab bhi is kii prashansa karte hai
 The Mist series was discontinued in September 2005 by its developer Cyan Worldad after publishing Myst V: End of Ages
 
 nency driu kii pustak par aadhaarit adventure games kaa prakaashan har interective dwaara jari rakhaa gaya or 1998 ke baad is kii 20 pratiyaan prakashit kii ja chuki hai
 Something similar happened with such stories, traditional graphical adventure games are constantly booming in the amateur scene
 yah sabase adhik adventure games studio ke liye urvar he
 Some of the famous AGS adventure games include, by Ben Crosha, Ben Jordan: Paranormal Investigator, Time Gentlemen, Please! And Soviet Unterzoegersdorf
 Adobe Flash is also a very popular device, known for the MOTAS adventure and room escape style
 haalanki aaj parmparik andventure games america bazaar main kam hi dekhne ko miltaa he lekin ection adventure games bahut aam hai, adventure or kirdaar par aadhaarit games main bahut samanta he
 Particular attention is paid to the composition in console-style games, especially in modern-day stories and role-playing games
 consol role-plaing games main saadharantah sajeesh or kahani par dhyaan diya jaataa he or is safalataa ke liye aanshik rup shrey final funtasi shrikhla ko jaataa he, jabaki 1998 main balders get kii safalataa ke baad computer par role-plaing game ko lagaataar prakashit kiya ja rahaa he
 Adventure games with third-person and landscape characters and direct character-controlled interfaces have now become very common
 segaa ke shenmue, shenmue II, quantic dream ke Omikron: The Nomad Soul or fahrenhit or konami kaa shedo of memorij jaise adventure game ke dwaara ise udhaaharan dekar samajhaayaa gaya he
