 Then for the next several years, the three companions embark on a number of exciting journeys while on Mongo, on which they also pass through several stops such as: in the forest kingdom of Arboria, ruled by Prince Barin; In Phrygia, the snowy state ruled by Queen Fria; In the jungle state Trapika, ruled by Rani Desaira; In the deep sea kingdom of shark humans, ruled by King Kala; Hakman's Udan city ruled by Prince Vultan

 Finally, after Raymond's term is over, his later writers create new enemies to encounter Flash

 Mastani was a very beautiful and brave woman
 vah peshwa bajirao pratham kii preyasi tathaa patni thi
 Bajirao himself considered her to be his wife, but as his wife he never got the family and social approval
 mastaani ke aarmabhik jivan kaa itihaas vivaadaaspad tathaa mukhyatah kinvadantiyon par aadhaarit he
 According to Sushila Vaidya, there is a special mention of Mastani in Maratha history in the middle of pre-18th century
 bakhar or lekhon se maaloom padataa he ki mastaani afagaan or gujars jati kii thi
 He was born in a dancing caste
 gujarat ke geeton main inhen 'nrutyaangna' yaa 'yavan kaanchani' ke naam se sambodhit kiya gaya he
 In fact, this description has been written by Sushila Vaidya based on little known sources
 vastav main yah vishay atyant vivaadaaspad rahaa he
 The famous historian Govind Sakharam Sardesai has written that Mastani's dynasty is unknown
 parampara se vah ek hindu pita or musalmaan mata kii santan kahi jaati he
 In fact, it is difficult to say for sure about Mastani's parents and family etc
 is sambandh main samakaleen lekhakon ne paraspar virdohi mat vyakt kiye hai
 According to an ancient life character of Bajirao, Mastani was the daughter of the Nizam of Hyderabad
 nawab kii begum ne uskaa vivaah bajirao se kar dene kaa aagrah kiya taaki nizaam-bajirao kii mitrataa sthaayee ban sake
 The marriage ceremony was performed but not directly from Bajirao but from his dagger
 baad main bajirao ne use apane paas bula liya
 According to some other authors, Mastani was the daughter of a concubine of Maharaja Chhatrasal
 jab usne bajirao dwaara di gayi sahaayta ke liye use anek uphaar aadi diye to mastaani bhi un main se ek thi
 Some other writers have written only that she was the daughter of a Hindu mother and a Muslim father
 dow0 bhagwaan das gupt kaa bhi maananaa he ki mastaani ke praarambhik jivan ke sambandh main koi bhi vishwasaneey vivaran uplabdh nahin he
 Mostly this belief is prevalent that Chhatrasal had presented it to the Peshwa
 bundelkhandi janashrutiyon ke anusaar vah chhatrasaal kii mughalani up patni se utpann kanya thi
 Translator of Nagnath Inamdar's famous Marathi novel Rau, which is one of the most successful historical novels, based on the love story of Bajirao Peshwa and Mastani, according to some new information, Mastani is said to have been originally Hindu and told That his name was originally Madan Kunwari
 unhone likhaa he ki hindi main madan kunwari or bajirao peshwa ke sambandh main na ke baraabar sahitya likhaa gaya he
 All those who have written on this subject in Marathi have considered Madan Kunwari Mastani as a Muslim and Bajirao's concubine
 parantu yah satya nahin he
 Mr
 Sudhindra Varma has introduced Madan Kunwari in his book
 orchha naresh ke ek sainik hammir singh kii putree thi madan kunwari
 Hamir Singh was Bundela Thakur
 usne khangaar thakur-kanya se vivaah kar liya tha
 On this matter, Bundel Thakurs expelled Hammir Singh from the caste
 orchha main betwa nadi ke tat par chaturbhuj mandir ke nikat jhopadi main hammirasingh rahata tha
 Older Rahman lived in a hut near his hut
 vah gayak tha
 He used to sing in court and in meetings
 vah akelaa hi tha
 He did not marry
 hammir singh or rahamaan donon ghanishtha mitra the
 Madan Kunwari was a girl of great mood
 vah chanchal alhad, param rupavati or kokilkanthi thi
 Hammir Singh was very fond of listening to songs and music
 donon mitra sandhya samay mil kar baithte or sangeet-vibhor hokar samay vyateet karte
 Madan Kunwari also became fond of singing
 mastaani apane samay kii adwitiya sundari evam sangeet kala main praveen thi
 He was also educated in horse riding and archery

 In the same year, Chimaji Appa attacked Shujaat Khan
 yuddh kshetra main hi shujgat khan kii mrityu hui
 Mastani also received Chimaji Appa along with the looted material
 chimaji appa ne unhen bajirao ke paas pahunchaa diya
 Subsequently Mastani and Bajirao survived for each other

 King Chhatrasal immediately sought help from Peshwa Bajirao
 bajirao apni sena sahit bundelkhand kii ore bade
 Mastani also went with Bajirao
 marathe or mughal do barshon tak yuddh karte rahe
 After that, Bajirao won
 chhatrasaal atyant aanandit hue
 He considered Mastani as his daughter
 is vivaran main bhi mastaani se sambandhit ansh sushila vaidya ne alpagyaat sroton ke aadhaar par hi likhaa he, kyonki govind sakhaaraam saradesai ne spasht likhaa he ki uske naam kaa pratham ullekh bajirao ke jyeshtha putr naanaa sahab ke vivaah sambandhi vrittanton ke pramanik patron main he
 The marriage took place on 11 January 1730 AD
 usee varsh bajirao ne pune main apane 'shanivaar bhawan' kaa nirmaan kiya tha
 In his novel Rau Swami, Nagnath Inamdar has also started the story from this time in accordance with the historicity
 ukt bhawan main hi bajirao ne jahaan mastaani ke rahane kaa prabandh kiya use 'mastaani mahal' or 'mastaani darwaja' kaa naam diya gaya he
 Mastani was Anindya Sundari
 vah susanskrit, kalavijna tathaa vyavhaar chatur thi
 She was uniquely in love with Bajirao
 vah nrity or gayan main to nipun thi hi par saath hi kushal ashwarohi tathaa shastr-vidya main bhi nipun thi
 He used to sing in public ceremonies on the occasion of Ganesh festival in Peshwa's palace
 vah sainik abhiyaanon main bhi bajirao ke saath rahati thi
 She rode with Bajirao in the army riding on a horse
 bajirao usase itnaa prem karata tha ki vah use ek kshan ke liye bhi apane se dur nahin hone detaa tha
 Mastani lived like a Hindu wife
 musalmaan hone par bhi vah hindu veshbhusha main hi rahati thi
 She took full care of Bajirao's comfort, his needs and his happiness
 hindu dharm-rakshak maratha rajya ke peshwa kaa ek muslim mahila ke prem-pash main fasana tatkaaleen samaaj kaise sahan karata? isi kaaran uske parivaar ke log bhi usase rusht rahete the
 His wife Kashibai was also deeply saddened by his callous attitude towards her
 bajirao ke virdohi sardaar uske tathaa mastaani ke prem kaa uske viruddh prachaar karne main upyog kar use logon kii drushti main giraane kaa praytn karte the
 Bajirao started consuming meat and liquor
 maharashtra ke brahman samaaj main yah varjya tha
 People said that this was the result of Mastani's contact
 brahman samudaay to ek prakaar se bajirao ko patit hi maanane laga tha
 In this context, the well-known historian Govind Sakharam Sardesai has considered with foresight and sympathy
 unhone likhaa he ki jansadharan ke anusaar maance tathaa madiraa ke prati bajirao kaa prem mastaani kii sangati ke kaaran tha
 But a person like Bajirao, who had to live the life of a soldier, could not follow the strict rules of the Brahmin caste, because he had to meet all kinds of people freely
 maharashtra ke ek brahman ke sankeern nishedhaatmak jivan main yah aakasmik parivartan swaabhaavik evam anivaary the, kyonki usko duurastha pradeshon main prayaag karnaa hota tha tathaa rajput darbaron ke sampark main aana padataa tha, jahaan par madirapan, maansaahaar tathaa dhumrapaan praayah hua hi karata tha
 This is one of the shortcomings of Bajirao
 apane prasaran kaal main maratha samaaj main nihsandeh mahan parivartan ho gaya tha
 Mastani also suffered a lot due to his association with Bajirao, but his love for Bajirao was unwavering
 mastaani ke 1734 i0 main ek putr hua
 He was named Shamsher Bahadur
 bajirao ne kalpi or baandaa kii soobedaari use dene kii ghoshnaa kar di
 In the early 1739 AD, unsuccessful attempts were made to break the relationship between Peshwa Bajirao and Mastani
 1739 i0 ke antim dinon main bajirao ko aavashyak kaary se puna chhodana padaa
 Mastani could not accompany Peshwa
 chimaji appa or naanaa sahab ne mastaani ke prati kathor yojana banaai
 They imprisoned Mastani in Parvati Bagh
 bajirao ko jab yah samachar mila, ve atyant du:khit hue
 He fell ill
 isi bich avasar paa mastaani kaid se bachakar bajirao ke paas 4 navambar 1739 i0 ko pataas pahaunchi
 Bajirao was relieved, but this situation could not last for long
 sheeghra hi purandare, kaaka morsset tathaa anya vyakti pataas pahunche
 Peshwa Bajirao's mother Radhabai and his wife Kashibai also reached with them
 unhone mastaani ko samajha bujhaakar laana aavashyak samajha
 Mastani returned to Poona
 kattarpanthi log mastaani ko maar hi daalana chaahate the, kyonki unke anusaar sabhi jhanjhaton kaa mul vahi thi
 They also tried to take orders from Chhatrapati, but Chhatrapati King Shahu was more intelligent
 unke adhikari govindrav ne 24 janvari 1740 isvi ko ek patr main likhaa he - mastaani ke vishay par maine nijee taur par raja kii ichha kaa pataa laga liya he
 He has serious objections to the proposal of forced severance or personal detention
 vah bajirao ko kisi bhi prakaar aprasann kiya janaa sahan nahin karegaa, kyonki vah sadaiv use prasann rakhana chahta he
 The blame is not on the woman
 is dosha kaa niraakaran usee samay ho saktaa he jab bajirao kii aisi ichha ho
 Raja cannot give any reason whatsoever to use violence against Bajirao's feelings
 1740 i0 ke aarambh main bajirao nasirajang se ladane ke liye nikal pade or godavari nadi ko parkar aurangabad ke paas shatru ko buree sthiti main laa diya
 On 27 February 1740, a treaty was reached between the two at Mungi Shegaon
 bajirao ke jivan kaa yah antim abhiyaan siddh hua
 At that time nobody knew that Bajirao's death was imminent
 7 march 1740 isvi ko nanasaheb ke naam chimna ji ke patr se andeh hota he ki bajirao hriday se rugn the
 Chimna ji wrote in this letter that since we have left each other, i have not received any news from Pujya Rao
 maine uske veikshipt man ko yathashakti shant karne kaa prayaas kiya, parantu maaloom hota he ki ishwar kii ichha kuch or hi he
 i do not know what will happen to us
 mere pune waapas hote hi ham ko chahie ki ham usko uske paas bhej den
 It is clear that Bajirao was extremely distraught
 mastaani ke virah tathaa use mukt karaane main apni aakshamata se use maansik klesh or kshobh tha
 He died of his first and last illness on 28 April 1740 AD
 is samay bajirao kii aayu keval 42 varsh kii thi
 He also had his forgiving wife Kashibai at the time of his death
 kinked evam parasnis ke anusaar mastaani apane priyatam ke saath sati ho gayi
 She has written that in this world she was separated from her beloved
 vah agni kii bhayankar jwaalaon ke bich se guzar kar duusare sansar main uskaa swaagat karne pahunch gayi
 However, this is controversial
 yah kahana kathin he ki usne aatmahatya kar lee yaa shok-prahaar se vah mar gayi
 His body was sent to Pabal, a small village about 20 miles east of Poona
 yah gaanv bajirao ne usko inaam main diya tha
 a simple tomb here reminds visitors of his love story and sad death
 sarvasammati se vah apane samay kii sarvaadhik sundari thi

 sambandhit janaganana code: Ecological footprint is a measure of human demand on Earth's ecosystems
 yah insaan kii maang kii tulana, prithvi kii paristhitiki ke punarutpaadan karne kii kshamta se karata he
 It refers to the amount of biological productive land and marine area needed to reproduce and absorb the waste consumed by human populations and to make them harmless
 iskaa prayog karte hue yah anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki agar prayek vyakti ek nishchit jivan style apanaae, to maanavtaa kii sahaayta ke liye prithvi ke kitne hisse kii zarurat hogi
 Mankind's total ecological footprint for 2006 was estimated to be 1
4 Earth planets, meaning mankind uses ecological services 1
4 times faster than their regeneration by Earth
 prati varsh is sankhya kii punarganana kii jaati he – sanyukt raashtra ko aadharbhoot aankade ikattha karne or prakashit karne main samay lagane ke kaaran yah teen saal peeche chalati he
 While the term ecological footprint is widely used, its methods of measurement differ
 haalanki gananaa ke maanak ab zyada tulanaatmak or sangat parinaam dene vaale ban kar ubhar rahe hai
 The first academic publication about the ecological footprint was in 1992 by William Rees
 paristhitik padchihn kii avadharana or gananaa kii vidhi 1990-1994 main canada ke vankuvar main british colombia vishvavidhyalay main ris ke paryvekshan main methis vaikaranajel ke phd shodh prabandh main viksit kii gai
 Originally, Wackernagel and Rees called the concept "approved carrying capacity"
 is avadharana ko or sulabh banane ke liye ris ne "paristhitik padchihn" naam ko pesh kiya, jo ek computer takanisian dwaara unke nae computer ke "mej par chote padchihn" kii prashansa se prerit tha
 In early 1996, Wackernagel and Rees published the book Our Ecological Footprint: Reducing Human Impact on the Earth
 paristhitik padchihn vishleshan, prakruti par maanav maang kii tulana, jeevamandal ke sansadhano ke punarutpaada or sevaayen uplabdh karaane kii kshamta se karti he
 It does this using the prevalent technology under which it assesses the biologically productive land and sea area required by mankind to consume resources and the absorption of waste generated by them
 ek surveykshan ke ant main padchihn mulyon ko koyala, bhojan, awaas or samagriyon tathaa sevaaon ke liye vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, saath hi saath prithvi kii kul padchihn sankhya jo upbhog ke us str par vishwa kii jansankhya ko banaaye rakhane ke liye aavashyak he
 This approach can also be applied to an activity such as manufacturing a product or driving a car
 yah sansaadhan lekha, jivan chakra vishleshan ke samaan hi he jisamen urja, jaev eendhan,, nirmaan saamagree, jal or duusare sansadhano ko bhoomi ke samanyikrut maap main parivartit kiya jaataa he, jise 'vaishvik hectare' kaha jaataa he
 Per capita ecological footprint is a means to compare consumption and lifestyle and to check nature's ability to provide this consumption
 yah upkaran, koi desh apni seemaa main uplabdh chizon kaa kis had tak zyada upyog karata he yaa desh kii jivan style kis had tak vaishvik str par anukaraniya hogi iskaa pareekshan kar, rajshasan niti ko suchit kar saktaa he
 The footprint can also be a useful tool for educating people about chargeability and over-consumption aimed at improving individual behavior
 paristhitik padchihn kaa istemaal is baat par tark karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he ki kai vartmaan jivan sheliyaan poshneey nahin hai
 Such global comparisons clearly show irregularities in the use of resources in the early twenty-first century on this planet
 2006 main duniya bhar main ausat prati vyakti jaivik utpaadak kshetra lagbhag 1
8 vaishvik hectare prati vyakti tha
 The US footprint was 9
0 gha per capita and Switzerland's 5
6 gha per capita while China had 1
8 gha per capita
 WWF kaa daawa he ki grah par maanav padchihn jaivakshmata se 20% zyada ho gaya he
 Wackernagel and Rees originally estimated that the biological capacity available to the 6 billion people on Earth at that time was 1
3 hectares per capita, lower than the 1
8 global hectares published for 2006, because neither global hectares nor preliminary studies have shown Bio-productivity of marine areas was included

 Nowadays ecological footprint is widely used as an indicator of environmental sustainability all over the world
 ye puri arthvyavastha ke sansadhano ke upyog ke maapan or prabandhan ke liye bhi istemaal kiye ja sakate hai
 They can also be used to explore the stability of individual lifestyles, goods and services, organizations, industry sectors, neighborhoods, cities, regions and countries
 2006 se, paristhitik padchihn maanakon kaa ek pratham set maujuud he jo sanchaar or gananaa, donon vidhiyon kaa varnan karata he
 They are available at www

org and were developed in a public process facilitated by Global Footprint Network and its partner organizations
 rashtriya str par paristhitik padchihn lekha vidhi kaa varnan Living Planet Report main kiya gaya he
 The National Accounting Committee of the Global Footprint System has also published a research agenda on how to improve this method
 vibhinn paristhitik padchihn adhyayanon dwaara prayog kii gai karypranaliyon main antar rahaa he
 Examples include how to calculate the maritime area, how to account for fossil fuels, how to account for nuclear power, what data sources were used, global numbers or localities when particular areas are taken into account When the numbers should be used, how the area of biodiversity should be included and how imports / exports should be kept accountable

 Computation of ecological footprint for densely populated areas, such as a city or small country with relatively large populations - for example New York and Singapore, respectively - can give rise to the notion of "parasites" about these populations

 Critics argue that this is a dubious description because mechanized rural farmers in developed countries can consume more resources than urban dwellers, due to transportation needs and the unavailability of a stratified economy

 Vapor compression, absorption, steam-jet and air cycle are notable among the commonly used refrigeration cycles
 in chakron ko samajhane se purv ooshmaa chakra samaj lenaa aavashyak he
 When a compressed is suddenly given the opportunity to be induced by a stable method, it cools down, because it does not get the energy required for work done in diffusion from the external environment, but only from inside
 isse uskaa taap is seemaa tak ho saktaa hai ki vah thos ke rup main jam jaay
 Some compression refrigerators have been built on this principle, in which air is used as a refrigerant gas
 isamen vaayu ko pehle khub kiya jaataa he or is kriya main utpann ooshmaa se gas ko nivrutt hone ke hetu vaayu kaa prayog hota he
 In this, the air is consumed first - and air is used to expel the gas from this action and the heat generated in this process
 isamen vaayu ko prasarbelan ke sthiroshm dhang se prasarit karaayaa jaataa he, jisase belan tathaa vaayu ko hi thande ho jate hai
 It enters the cold air and compressed air propagation news, where it has a steady diffusion
