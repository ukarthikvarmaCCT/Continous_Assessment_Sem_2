 But in 1886, he again appeared as a high-profile well-known writer and in the same year published his great novel work "the Death of Ivan Ilyich"
 unke aachaar sambandhi vishwaason ke prati ab sara sansar aakrishth ho chukaa tha or yasnaya polyana gram kii manyata utkrisht tirthasthali ke rup main jagaddhikhyath ho chuki thi

 Towards the end of the 19th century, Tolstoy's service to the poor and helpless grew to such an extent that he donated all his income from his creations to Russia
 apni patni ko maatr utana ansh lene kii unhone anumati di jitna parivaar ke bhar poshan ke liye anivaary tha
 He gave all the proceeds of his novel called 'resurgence' to the Russian pacifist caste Dukhbor people to abandon Russia and settle in Canada
 1910 main sahasaa unhone apane paitrik gram "yasnaya polyana" ko sarvada ke liye parityakt karne kaa nishchay kiya
 He departed with his daughter Alexandra on 10 November 1910, but on 22 November 1910, he accidentally died in a lung in the passage station Estapovo
 unki dharmabhavana badi udaar or vyapak thi
 He had a clear antagonism towards the then Christianity
 apane vichaaron se ve ek prakaar ke sarvadevvaadi prathit hote hai
 He considered death as the inevitable end of the body
 manushya ko ve sharir kii antim or avashyambhavi parinti maanate the
 He considered it appropriate to assess everything that came in contact with human beings from the criteria of utility and for this reason he always remained curious about the purpose of life
 niruddeshy, vichaarheen ore aatmakendrit jivan ko ve ek prakaar kaa paap maanate the; yahan tak ki sambhog ko ve keval santanotpatti ke uddeshy se hi vihit maanate the
 In psychological works, Fyodor Dostoyevsky equates Tolstoy
 galswardi, tamas maan, juls romyna aadi mahaan lekhakon par tollstoy kaa ullekhneey prabhaav padaa he
 Later Russian writers have also been strongly influenced by Tolstoy
 lenin sahit vishwa ke anekanek vidwaanon ne tolastoy ke sahitya, visheshtah 'yuddh or shaanti' kii sarvshereshthata muktakanth se sweekaar kii he; parantu tolastoy ek vichaarak bhi the or saahitiyik rachanaaon ke saath-saath nibandhon tathaa anya vidhaon main bhi unhone apane vichaaron kii abhivyakti kii he
 Regarding the usefulness of his age-old reference ideas, Lenin believes that "tolstoy has created such fine literature that will always be valuable and readable to the public, when he overturns the zamindars and the capitalists and arranges a social life for himself Will do it
 saath hi tolastoy ullekhneey oj ke saath vartmaan vyavastha main paddalit aam janata kii manodasha ko vyakt karne tathaa uski dasha kaa varnan karne tathaa uske virodh evam rosh ke swatahsfoort bhaavon ko mukherit karne main samarth hue hai
 Tolstoy mainly belonged to the era from 1861 to 1904 and has - as an artist, thinker and preacher - highlighted in his works the historical peculiarities of the First Russian Revolution, its capabilities and flaws with surprising clarity
 " Despite this, in the context of the various flaws of the ancient system, the internal vacuity of the rich class and the views of Tolstoy appearing against him, Lenin states that "there was nothing new in Tolstoy's criticism
" unhone koi aisi baat nahin kahi jo unase bahut arase pehle europea tathaa roosi sahitya main mehanatakashon ke himytiyon dwaara na kahi gayi ho
 The characteristic and historical significance of Tolstoy's criticism is that the radical change in the attitude of the mass people of Russia - the pastoral, peasants of our period - is expressed in such a way, Which was just the work of a talented artist
 " Lenin understood Tolstoy's literary significance very well and therefore he has praised him heavily; But at the same time he also understood the imperative of being aware of many harmful aspects of his ideas in the era
 isliye disambar 1910 main unhone spashtatya yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastoy kii saahitiyik rachanaaon kaa adhyayan karke roosi majdoor varg apane dushmano ko zyada acchhee tarah pahchaan sakegaa
 By studying his principles, the entire Russian public will know what his personal weakness, which prevented him from fulfilling his goal of independence, was contained
 aage badhane ke liye yah jaananaa jaruri he
 All those who are obstructing this progress, declare Tolastoy as 'the conscience of all of us', 'life-teacher'
 yah vah jhooth he jise udaarataavaadi jo tolastoy ke siddhanton ke kranti-virdohi pahalu kaa istemaal karnaa chaahate hai, jaanboojhkar failaa rahe hai
 Tolstoy's lie of being a 'life-teacher' is seen by some former social-democrats who are seen by liberals
 roosi janata aazaadee tabhi praapt karegi, jab vah samaj legi ki use behatar jivan ke liye sangharsh karne kii shiksha tolastoy se nahin, balki us varg se leni he, jiskaa mahatv tolastoy nahin samaj paye or jo us puraani duniya ko, jisase tolastoy ghrinaa karte the, ukhaad phenkane main samarth ekmaatr varg he -- arthath sarvhaara varg se
 Lenin again elaborated on 22 January 1911, citing some of Tolstoy's narrative works, as well as several non-fiction works, expressing the view that despite being a reactionary and utopian element in Tolstoyism, some circles of the public 25 years ago For perhaps, critical elements of Tolstoy's theories could have had practical utility
 par ab, udhaahrantah pichley dashak main, aisi baat nahin ho sakati thi, kyonki pichhali shatabdi ke nauven dashak se lekar shatabdi ke ant tak aitihaasik vikaas bahut aage bad gaya he
 So today, when the above events have put an end to the 'eastern' stagnation, today, when the consciously reactionary, narrow-class and selfish-class meanings of 'vakhi' cults spread so widely among the liberal bourgeoisie Gone, today, when some of the Marxists, who are showing the contagion of these ideas, have also felt that the result is the 'immersionist' tendency, then respect the principles of Tolastoy To justify or smuggle their 'disrespect', their 'soul' woes, their call for 'self-realization', the principle of 'conscience' and world 'love', their teachings of austerity and Quietism, etc
 Every effort to do it is the direct and deepest loss

 Work on the ULAN began in 1984, when the Getty decided to merge and coordinate controlled vocabulary resources for use by the J
 Paul Getty Trust's many automated documentation projects
 The Art and Architecture Thesaurus was already being managed by the Getty at this time, and the Getty attempted to respond to requests from Getty projects for additional controlled vocabularies for artists' names and geographic names
 In 1987 the Getty created a department dedicated to compiling and distributing terminology
 The ULAN grows and changes via contributions from the user community and editorial work of the Getty Vocabulary Program
 Although originally intended only for use by Getty projects, the broader art information community outside the Getty expressed a need to use ULAN for cataloging and retrieval
 The Getty thus distributed ULAN for broader use according to the tenets previously established for the construction and maintenance of the Art and Architecture Thesaurus: Its scope includes names needed to catalog and retrieve information about the visual arts and architecture; it is based on terminology that is current, warranted for use by authoritative literary sources, and validated by use in the scholarly art and architectural history community; and it is compiled and edited in response to the needs of the user community
 Originally constructed as a simple alphabetized "union list" of clustered artist names and biographies, in order to make it consistent with the AAT and Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names, in the late 1990s ULAN was brought into compliance with national and international standards for thesaurus construction
 Its scope was broadened to include corporate bodies such as architectural firms and repositories of art, which may have hierarchical levels
 The ULAN was founded under the management of Eleanor Fink
 The ULAN has been constructed over the years by numerous members of the user community and an army of dedicated editors, under the supervision of several managers
 The ULAN was published in 1994 in hardcopy and machine-readable files
 Given the growing size and frequency of changes and additions to the ULAN, by 1997 it had become evident that hard-copy publication was impractical
 It is now published in automated formats only, in both a searchable online web interface and in data files available for licensing
 The data for ULAN is compiled and edited in an editorial system that was custom-built by Getty Technical Staff to meet the unique requirements of compiling data from many contributors, merging, moving, and publishing in various formats
 Final editorial control of the ULAN is maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program, using well-established editorial rules
 The current managers of the ULAN are Patricia Harpring, Managing Editor, and Murtha Baca, Head, Vocabulary Program and Digital Resource Management
 The ULAN is a structured vocabulary containing around 120,000 records, including 293,000 names and biographical and bibliographic information about artists and architects, including a wealth of variant names, pseudonyms, and language variants
 Even though the structure is relatively flat, the ULAN is constructed as a hierarchical database; its trees branch from a root called Top of the ULAN hierarchies; it currently has two published facets: Person and Corporate Body
 Entities in the Person facet typically have no children
 Entities in the Corporate Body facet may branch into trees
 There may be multiple broader contexts, making the ULAN structure polyhierarchical
 In addition to the hierarchical relationships, the ULAN also has equivalent and associative relationships

 The oldest criterion for identifying under-represented groups is caste

 The fundamental principle is that under-representation of identifiable groups is a legacy of the Indian caste system
 bharat kii swatantraaa prapti ke baad bharat ke samvidhan ne pehle ke kuch samoohon ko anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati ke rup main soochibaddh kiya
 The framers of the Constitution believed that due to the caste system, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes remained historically backward and were not given respect and equal opportunities in Indian society and hence their share in nation-building activities was low

 An additional complication is that some castes / communities that are considered untouchables in one province but not in other provinces

 Proponents of the reservation policy point out that the traditional caste system, which has traditionally run, has severe oppression and segregation for the lower castes and limited their various kinds of freedom, including education

 The status of major decisions and their implementation by Indian courts is given below: praasangik maamle The term creamy layer was first coined in the Kerala State v
 NM Thomas case in 1975 when a judge stated that "the benefits of reservation would be stripped of the top creamy layer of the backward class, thus making the weakest and whole cakes among the weak Except the lucky layers to consume "

 This decision also established the concept of qualitative exclusion, such as the "creamy layer"

 The Creamy Layer criterion was introduced in 1993 for Rs 1 lakh, and was revised to Rs 2

 The reservation system in Tamil Nadu is very different from the rest of India; This is not due to the nature of the reservation but because of its history
 may 2006 main jab pehali baar aarakshan kaa jabardast virodh nai dilli main hua, tab chennai main iske vipareet ekadam visham shanti dekhi gayi thi
 Later, the anti-reservation lobby gained precedence in Delhi, protesting in the quiet lane of Chennai demanding reservation

 31 seat list is used as non-reserved open entry list and 69 seats are filled using 69% reservation
 The effective reservation percentage depends on how many non-reserved category students fall in the list of 50 and not in the 31 list
 At one extreme, all 19 may be non-reserved category students, in which case the total reservation becomes 58%; It can also be argued that by considering it as 19% 'reservation' for non-reserved category students it becomes / 119 or 74%! At the other extreme, in the list of 31, no 19 are added to the non-reserved category, then no super-numbered seats will be created in this case and 69% reservation will be done as per the state law order

 Homosexuality refers to a person being sexually and romantically attracted to people of the same sex
 ve purush, jo anya purushon ke prati aakarshith hote he unhen "purush samalingi" yaa ge or jo mahila kisi anya mahila ke prati aakarshith hoti he use bhi ge kaha ja saktaa he lekin use aamtaur par "mahila samalingi" yaa lasbian kaha jaataa he
 People who are attracted to both women and men are called bisexual
 kul milakar samalangik, ubhaylangik or lingaparivartit logo ko milakar el ji bi tii samudaay banataa he
 It is hard to say how many people are gay
 samalangikta kaa astitv sabhi samskritiyon or deshon main paaya gaya he, yadhyapi kuch deshon kii sarkarein is baat kaa khandan karti he
 Although it can be said that the term homosexuality is used for people who are romantically attracted to people of the same sex, there are other definitions
 yadi koi samalangikta ko is arth main letaa he ki yah shabd keval un logo ke liye prayukt hota he jo samaan ling ke logon ke prati aakarshith hote hai, tab is paribhaasha ke anusaar kahin adhik log samalangik honge bajaay ki yadi koi samalangikta kaa arth keval yah samajhataa ho jisamen do samanlingi logon ke aapasi yon-sambandh he
 Typically, the term is used for all people who are attracted to the same sex, even for those who do not yet have homosexual sex
 baharhaal, samalangikta kaa sabase dikhaai dene vaala rup vaastavik sambandh he
 Most evidence of homosexuality in ancient cultures comes from paintings depicting two men in intimate relationships or sexual acts
 kuch log homophil or φιλεῖν ) shabd kaa bhi upyog karte hai
 This word is usually a "polite" word
 yah aamtaur par un logon ke liye prayukt hota he jo keval apane ling ke logon ke prati aakarshith hote hai, par jinke samalangik sambandh nahin he yaa wo samarth nahin hai
 Many words are used for homosexuals
 inamen se kuch kaa upyog samalangikon ko apamaanit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 However, the LGBT community sometimes uses these words to describe themselves
 yah in shabdon ko kam kshtakaari banane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Some of the terms used for gay men are gay and queer
 samalangik mahilaon ke liye prayukt hone vaale kuch shabd hai lasbian or dike
 The term lasbian is mostly used
 dike kam upyog main aane vaala shabd he, jo kabhi-kabhi un lasbiyanon ke liye prayukt hota he, jo adhik purushon jaisi hoti hai 
 When gay people keep their sexual orientation a secret, they are said to be "in the closet"
 "khulaa" yaa "kothri se baahar" ek kathboli shabd he, jiskaa arth he ki koi samalangik vyakti apni langik prarthamikta ko lekar khulaa hua he
 This means that the person does not hide the fact of his homosexuality
 kuch samalangik log isliye apni langikta ko chhipate he ki ve sochate hai ki pataa lagane par na jane kya hoga yaa ve aise kshetra main rahete hai jo samalangikon ke liye surakshit nahin he
 Sometimes people who are "open" also say they are 'proud'
 "khulaa" yani ki ve apni langik prarthamikta ko nahin chipa rahe hai
 "proud" means that they are not ashamed of it
 "garv hona" yaa "garv karnaa", kaa algebiti samudaay main vishesh arth he
 This means that they are happy and celebrating their homosexuality
 iskaa arth "garv hona" hona nahin he, jaise unhonen koi aisa kaam kiya ho, lekin iskaa arth lajjit hone ke viparit he
 Many cities have "pride parades"
 pehle ye virodh pradarshan hua karte the, lekin aaj, inhen aamtaur par utsav manaane ke liye yojit kiya jaataa he or ye adhikanshtah june ke maheene main 1969 ke neuyork shahar main bhadke 'stonewal dangon' kii smriti main yojit hoti hai
 These riots occurred as a result of police harassing people when they were gay
 'stonewal' yaa 'stonewal dange' kabhi-kabhi algebiti adhikaar andolan kaa prarambh bhi maane jate hai
 The reasons for being gay and bisexual are disputed
 bahut se dharmon main samalangikta yaa ubhaylangikta ko paap mana jaataa he
 In some religions homosexuality or bisexuality is seen as choices that depend on a person's own choice
 parantu, bahut se aadhunik vaigyanikon dwaara darshaya gaya he ki samalangikta vikalp nahin he
 The factors of homosexuality are not yet clear, but the effects and environment of genetics and prenatal hormones are sometimes considered its factors
 vaigyanikon ne yah bhi darshaya he ki samalangikta keval manushyon main hi nahin balki bahut si pashu prajatiyon main bhi pai jaati he
 Homosexuality has also been found in many animals such as penguins, chimpanzees, and dolphins, some even as humans for a lifetime
 bahut se vaigyanik or chikitsak is baat par sahamat hai ki samalangik vyavhaar ko badla nahin ja saktaa he
 Homosexuals were treated by doctors assuming that it was a mental disease
 yadhyapi, ab bahut se deshon main samalangikta ko chikitsakon dwaara maansik rog kii shrenee main nahin rakhaa jaataa he
 There are some religious communities, which are in the treatment of homosexuality
 ise 'riperrative chikitsa' kaha jaataa he
 In this type of therapy, many homosexuals have tried to make themselves heterosexual and they claim that they have changed, but many people do not believe that this is possible
 riperrative chikitsa kii bahut se chikitsa or manorog vigyaan samoohon dwaara ninda kii gai he, jaise america manovaigyanik sangh, america manorog sangh, royal manochikitsak mahavidhyalay, rashtriya saamaajik kaaryakarta sangh, royal nursing mahavidhyalay or america bal chikitsa academy
 These scientific and educated groups agree that sexual orientation or sexual orientation cannot be changed
 yah is baat par bhi sahamat hai ki riperrative chikitsa kaa samalangikon par aahatkaari prabhaav ho saktaa he
 Many people consider it unfortunate that without discussing the factors of heterosexuality, the factors of homosexuality and bisexuality are being discussed
 yadhyapi yah samajhnaa saral he ki vishamalangikta ke astitv kaa kya kaaran he, lekin yah is baat par prakaash nahin daalata ki samalangik logon ke mastishk kaa vikaas kis prakaar hota he
 Heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality are all reasons, and some believe that discussing only homosexuality and bisexuality suggests that there is something wrong with people with these types of sexual preferences

 bahut se deshon main samalangik apane jodidar se vaidhanik rup se vivaah nahin kar sakate
 However, they can have the same relationship as heterosexuals
 samalangik praayah ek duusare ko 'jodidar' yaa 'jivan-saathi' kehete he, bajaae ki 'pati' yaa 'patni' kehane ke
 They may have a 'commitment ceremony' rather than a matrimonial ceremony
 kuch samalangikon kaa vivaah samaaroh hota he, yadhyapi sarkaar dwaara ise manyata nahin di jaati yaa sweekaar nahin kiya jaataa
 They call their partner husband or wife, without worrying about the law
 par unke liye vivaah keval naam ke liye nahin he
 Married people have many benefits
 kisi deshaanusaar ye laabh bahut prakaar ke ho sakate hai, jaise - kam kar bhugtan, apane pati / patni kaa beemaa paanaa, sampatti kaa uttaradhikari hona, saamaajik suraksha laabh, bachche paidaa karnaa yaa god lenaa, apane pati / patni ke desh pravasgaman, apane biimaar pati / patni ke liye kisi vikalp kaa chunaav karnaa, yaa apane biimaar pati / patni ko aspataal milane janaa

 This decision also applies to the State of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 141 of the Constitution of India and the Delhi Agreement 1952, as Section 377 of the IPC and the Ranbir Penal Code is cross materia and the judicial accent has been extended to Jammu and Kashmir
 vivaah ke bajaae kuch deshon yaa rajyon main samalangikon ke liye 'naagarik sangyojan' yaa 'gharelu bhagidaari' kaa praavdhaan he
 Some, but not all, benefits and benefits related to marriage are available under these provisions
 naagarik sangyojan yaa gharelu bhagidaari jaise praavdhaanon ko algebiti samudaay dwaara 'duusare darje' ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Gay couples do have some advantages in this, but they aim that these types of couples are not as important or legitimate as heterosexual couples
 kuch log to inaki tulana "alag lekin samaan" niyamon se bhi karte hai jinka upyog america main logon ko nasleey rup se pruthak karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 They believe that separate rules can never be the same and that homosexuals should be rejected as second class citizens
 samalangik yonkriya yaa ge sex use kehete hai jab samaan ling ke logon ke bich yon sambandh hon, chaahe ve do yaa do se adhik purush hon yaa mahilaayein
 Many religions consider homosexual sex as a sin, including Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Christianity
 yadhyapi in dharmon ke kuch sampradaayon main, mukhyatah isiyat or yahudiyat main ab samalangikta ko sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 In modern times homosexuality is accepted in "western" countries
 adhikansh pashchimi deshon main samalangiko ko hinsa or bhedbhaav se bachaane ke liye kanoon bane hue hai
 Although in many countries homosexuals are not protected from discrimination
 ek samalangik vyakti ko keval isliye naukari se nikaala ja saktaa he kyonki vah samalangik he, bhale hi vah kitna acha karmchaaree kyon naa ho
 Homosexuals may also be deprived of renting a house or eating in a restaurant due to their sexual orientation
 in deshon main samalangik hinsa or bhedbhaav kaa anubhav kar sakate hai
 For example, Islamic law is used in some places to put homosexuals in prison and even to inflict capital punishment
 kuch samoohon kaa maananaa he ki 1979 ke baad se iran main lagbhag 4,000 samalangikon ko unki langik prarthamikta ke aadhaar par phaansi di ja chuki he
 In 2005, two teenage boys were hanged after fourteen months of captivity and torture
 united kingdom main samalangikta aparaadh hua karata tha
 The famous Irish writer named Oscar Wilde was taken captive by this and, as a result, his reputation as a comedian and playwright suffered a major setback
 ellen turing naam ke vyakti ko, jisane dwitiya vishwa yuddh main germanon dwaara prayukt kiye gaye anigma code ko tod kar mitra rashtron kii sahaayta kii thi, par is aparaadh kaa doshi tehraaya gaya or antat uski samalangikta ke upachaar ke prabhaav ke kaaran usne aatmahatya kar lee
 Today, gays are safe in the United Kingdom
 vayaskon ke bich yon sambandh aparaadh nahin he
 Gay men and women may not marry, but they may have a "civil partnership" under which certain rights and benefits related to marriage are granted
 samalangik purush sena main bhartee ho sakate hai
 So although many things have changed in the United Kingdom, homosexuals still do not have full and equal rights

 ganit main samaan agyaat raashi vaale raikhik samikarnon ke samucchy ko raikhik samikarnon kaa nikaay kaha jaataa he
 for example, teen char raashiyon x, y, z main teen samikarnon kaa ek nikaay he
 Putting numerical values in place of the variables of a linear body satisfies all those equations simultaneously, that set of numbers is called the 'solution of the equation body'
 upar die gayi samikarnon ke nikaay kaa hal yah he: Because these values of x, y, and z satisfy the above three equations
 "nikaay" is baat kaa sanket karata he ki sabhi samikarnon ko ek saath vichaar karnaa he, alag-alag nahin
 Solving the body of linear equations is one of the oldest works of mathematics
 bahut se kshetron kii samasyaon ko hal karte samay raikhik sameekaran nikaay se saamana hota he
 Such as numerical signal processing, linear optimization
 araikhik ganitiya samasyaon ke rekhikaran se bhi raikhik sameekaran nikaay praapt hota he
 To solve these, the Gauss deletion method can be solved efficiently by Cholesky decomposition or LU decomposition

 From the point of view of generalization, the body of m linear equations in n unknown quantities can be written as follows: a 11 x 1 + a 12 x 2 + 


 + a 1 n x n = b 1 a 21 x 1 + a 22 x 2 + 


 + a 2 n x n = b 2 


 


 


 


 


 a m 1 x 1 + a m 2 x 2 + 


 + a m n x n = b m { \ displaystyle { \ begin{matrix}a_{11}x_{1}&+a_{12}x_{2}&+ \ dots &+a_{1n}x_{n}&=b_{1} \ \ a_{21}x_{1}&+a_{22}x_{2}&+ \ dots &+a_{2n}x_{n}&=b_{2} \ \ \ xxwrep 10 dots & \ dots \ \ a_{m1}x_{1}&+a_{m2}x_{2}&+ \ dots &+a_{mn}x_{n}&=b_{m} \ end{matrix}}} The above equation body can also be written as follows: vector rup main nirupit uparokt sameekaran ko matrix gunan kaa prayog karte hue nimnlikhit atyant sankshipt rup main bhi likhaa ja saktaa he
 Where raikhik sameekaran nikaay ko hal karne evam anya kaaryon ke liye uparokt samikarnon main aaye hue gunaakon a i j { \ displaystyle a_{ij}} ko ek avyuuh A, { \ displaystyle A,} ke rup main rakhana bahut suvidhajanak rahata he
 This matrix is called multiplication
 isi prakaar agyaat raashiyon ko ek vector matrix ke rup main liya jaataa he tathaa sameekaran main aaye sabhi char-viheen padon ko bhi vector matrix b ke rup main liya jaataa he
 But while solving equations etc
, all equations need not be written with unknown amounts
 vastav main sari ganitiya sankriyaayein a or b par hi kii jaatin he
 Therefore, it is more appropriate to write the amplified coefficient matrix by working together and working with them
 pravardhit gunank avyuuh neeche likhaa he: In 1750, Kramer suggested a direct method for solving a body of linear equations
 yah gunank matrix ke vyutkraman par aadhaarit he
 Let n be the solution of a linear equation body with unknown quantities
 matrix rup main likhane par yah sameekaran nikaay is prakaar he: According to Kramer's rule, the value of xi { \ displaystyle x_ {i}} will be derived from the following formula: jahaan a i { \ displaystyle A_{i}} vah matrix he jo a { \ displaystyle A} ke i'wein kollam ke sthaan b { \ displaystyle b} ke avyavon ko rakhane se praapt hoti he

 The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has further divided NREM into three levels: N1, N2 and N3
 The last level is also known as delta sleep or slow-wave sleep
 REM or NREM ke chakra main neend agrasar hoti jaati he, kram saamaanya rup se N1 → N2 → N3 → N2 → REM hota he
 Much deeper sleep occurs early in the night, while the ratio of REM sleep increases later in the night and just before natural awakening
 1937 main sabase pehle alfred lee loomis or unke sahakarmiyon ne neend ke charnon kaa varnan kiya tha; jinhone neend kii vibhinn electroencephalography visheshtaon ko paanch staron main vibhajit kiya tha, jo jaagrathavastha se gahari neend ke kram kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 In 1953, a different form of REM sleep was discovered and thus William Dement and Nathaniel Kleitman reclassified sleep into NREM stages and REM
 1968 main "aar and ke sleep scoring manual" main alaan rechtcamphen or anthoni kales ne charnon ke maandand ko manakikrut kiya
 In the R&K standard, NREM sleep was divided into four stages, with slow-wave sleep stages being stages 3 and 4
 charan 3 main, delta tarangen kul tarang pattern kaa 50% se kam hoti hai, jabaki charan 4 main ye 50% se adhik ho jaaya karti hai
 In addition, REM sleep was sometimes referred to as stage 5
 2004 main, AASM ne aar and ke scoring pranali kii samiksha ke liye AASM drishy scoring task force ko niyukt kiya

 isse neend to aa sakati he or behoshee jaisi haalat lag sakati he, lekin isse shaareerik kaary puure nahin hote 
 According to the 2007 AASM Standards, NREM consists of three phases
 enariem main apekshaakrit kam sapane aayaa karte hai
 Phase N1 is related to the transition of the brain, in this phase the brain transitions from alpha waves of 8 to 13 Hz to theta waves of 4 to 7 Hz frequencies
 is charan ko kai baar uneendaapan yaa oonghti neend kaha jaataa he
 Sudden jerking and sleep emergence are also known as positive myoclonus, which may be associated with the onset of sleep during N1
 kuch logon ko is charan ke dauraan nidrajanak matibhram bhi ho saktaa he, jo unke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 During N1, the person loses some muscle condition and most conscious awareness of the external environment
 charan N2 kii visheshta he ki is dauraan neend kii takali 11 se 16 hertz or ke-samashtiyon ke bich gumti rahati he
 During this phase, as measured by EMG, muscle activity decreases and conscious awareness of the external environment disappears
 vayaskon main yah charan kul neend ke 45% se 55% main hua karata he
 The characterization of stage N3 is performed in such a way that at least 20% of the delta waves are between 0
5 and 2 Hz and the peak-to-peak amplitude is> 75 μv
 isi charan main raatri aatank, raatri shayyamutra, neend main chalanaa or neend main badbadana jaise parasomanian hua karte hai
 Many illustrations and descriptions still depict N3 phase with 20% –50% delta waves and N4 with more than 50% delta waves; These are jointly stage N3
 tej netra gati neend, yaa aariem neend, adhikansh maanav vayaskon kii kul neend kaa 20%–25% hua karti he
 Criteria for REM sleep include rapid eye movements and a rapid low-voltage EEG
 isi charan main sabase yaadgaar sapane aayaa karte hai
 At least in mammals, a descending muscle strain has been observed
