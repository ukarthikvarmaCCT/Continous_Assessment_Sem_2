 usne nauka main savaar sabhi yatriyon ko pakadakar apni rajdhani main le jaakar kaid kar liya
 According to his routine in the Supriya prison, he started worshiping Lord Shiva
 anya bandi yatriyon ko bhi vah shiv bhakthi kii prerana dene laga
 When Daruk heard this news about his beloved from his servants, he became very angry and came to that prison
 supriy us samay bhagavan shiv ke charnon main dhyaan lagaae hue donon ankhen band kiye baitha tha
 Seeing this pose of that monster, scolding him in a very fierce voice said- 'hey wicked Vaishya! You are closing your eyes and thinking about what disturbance and conspiracy here? ' Even after he said this, the tomb of the divine Shiva devotee Supriya was not broken

 He started praying to Lord Shiva for the liberation of himself and other prisoners from the concentrated mind
 use yah purna vishwaas tha ki mere aradhy bhagavan shivaji is vipatti se mujhe avashya hi chhutkaaraa dilaayenge

 Dharma sutra means tax sarvapratham praarambhik lekhankan ke record pracheen babylon, asyria or sumeria ke khandhiron main paae gaye, jo 7000 varshon se bhi pehle kii taarikh ke hai
 The people of the time relied on ancient accounting methods to record the growth of crops and cattle
 kyonki krishi or pashu paalan ke liye prakritik ritu hoti he, atah agar fasalon kii paidaavaar ho chuki ho yaa pashuon ne nae bachche paidaa kiye hon to hisaab-kitaab kar adhishesh ko nirdhaarit karnaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 8000–3700 BC During the period, the Fertile Crescent witnessed the spread of small settlements supported by agricultural surpluses
 Symbols with simple geometric shapes, such as cones or spheres, were used for management purposes related to the identification and protection of this surplus, and these symbols are examples of accounts referencing personal property lists
 unamem se kuch utkirnit chhedon vaali kati-fatty rekhaaen tathaa gahare khude vinduon ke rup main chihnit hai
 The chieftains of the new stone carpets used to collect surplus as a part of the crops and cattle of the farmers at regular intervals

 7000 BCE, there were only 10 symbol sizes, because in this system specific agricultural commodities were recorded, from which every agricultural product was taken at that time, such as grain grains, oil, and pets
 The number of these emblems rose to around 350 around 3500 BC, when urban workshops started contributing to the redistribution of the economy
 Some of these new symbols were symbols for raw materials such as wool and metal and some for finished products such as clothing, dress, jewelry, bread, beer and honey
 mitti ke pratikon ke istemaal vaale bahi khaataa ke avishkaar ne maanav jati ko ek vishaal sangyanatmak oochaal kaa darja diya

 Compared to transferring verbal information from one person to another, tokens were extra-physical, objects outside the human brain
 faltah nav prastaryugin lekhaakaar kisi ke gyaan ke mook mukhapakshi nahin rah gaye, balki aakandon ke kuta lekhan or kutanuwaad main unhone sakriy hissaa liya
 The symbol system was replaced by miniature counters in exchange for real goods, which removed the bulk cargo and its weight from the way of transaction and provided abstract figures to represent the figures in a particular configuration
 As a result, heavy baskets full of grains and animals that were difficult to control could now be easily counted and re-counted
 lekhaakaar in countaron ko khiskaakar yaa hataakar jod, ghataav, guna or bhaag kar sakate the
 During the period 3700 to 2900 BC Mesopotamia's civilization emerged with technological innovations such as traction sailing and workmanship on copper metal
 Clay plates on which to record commercial transactions executed by religious places in hieroglyphs Characters were printed, they started appearing
 Ceramics, called bullets, were used in the Elamite city of Shusha that contained tokens
 ye paatr aakaar main golakaar hote the or dhakkan ke rup main kaam main laaye jate the; jinpar un logon kii muhar khudi hoti thi jo saude main hissaa lete the
 The markings of the tokens contained in them were graphically displayed on their surface, and after receiving and inspecting them, the consignee could check whether they resembled the magnitude and characteristics expressed on the bulla
 The fact that the bulla's material was marked on its surface therefore yielded a simple way to test without destroying the vessel, establishing an action in writing that, a subsidiary of the existing system for controlling merchandise In spite of being as persistent, it eventually became a clear practice for non-verbal communication
 aakhirkaar, bulle kii jagah mitti kii takhtiyon kaa istemaal kiya jane laga, jisamen pratikon ko darshane ke liye chihnon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 During the period of Sumerian civilization, the accounting of the token of the lid was replaced by the flat earthen mounds, influenced by the fact that the tokens are merely transfers of symbols

 Such inscriptions are imitations of the earliest found ancient method of writing in intricate inscriptions carved in clay tablets written in Sumerian language at Gemdet Nasr in 2900 BC

 The race gesta divi augusti means "the supernatural deeds of the divine Augustus" is a remarkable account of the management of the Emperor Augustus for the Roman people

 It was not an account of the revenue and expenditure of the state, but was created specifically to represent Augustus's bounty
 lekhankan ke pariprekshya main res gesta divi agsti kaa mahatva is tathy main nihit he ki yah vistaar se vyakhya karata he ki kaaryakari adhikari ko vistaarit vittiya soochna paane kaa adhikaar tha, lagbhag chalis saal kii kalavadhi ko samete hue jo ghatnakram ke pashchaat bhi ab tak phir se bahaali karne laayak tha
 The field of accounting information under the management of the emperor expresses that its objective consisted of both planning and decision making
 roman itihaaskaaron suetonius or casius dio ne yah record kiya he ki 23 isvi purv main, augustus ne ek reshnarium taiyaar kiya jisamen saarvajanik rajasav erarium main rokad kii rakam, prantiy fissi or publiconi ke haathon main rakam kii suchi hoti thi;evam isamen aaazaad unmukt logon tathaa daason ke naam bhi shaamil hua karte the jinase vistaarit lekha kii jaankaree praapt kii ja sakati thi
 The proximity of this information to the executive authority of the emperor was verified by Tacitus' statement that it was written by Augustus himself
 nakadi,vastuon, evam lenden ke records roman sainya karmiyon dwaara imaanadaaree se rakhe jate the
 The account of the small amount of cash received within a few days at the Vindolanda Fort at Sira 110 Christian Era shows that the fort had so much efficiency that cash revenue could be calculated daily, perhaps a surplus of supplies
 Manufactured goods for sale or camping, goods distributed among slaves such as, servesa, and klavi caligares as well as goods purchased by soldiers, etc
 That The basic needs of the fort are mix of direct production, shopping and demand; The demand for money to buy 5000 Modi braces in one vessel suggests that the fort had a provision for shopping for a large number of people

 During the Middle Ages barter was the dominant practice for traveling merchants

 The use of the terms debit and credit in accounting has its historical origins since the time of the practice of single-entry bookkeeping whose main purpose was to find and decide the amount owed to customers and the amount to be returned to creditors
 'vah rini he' kaa latin 'debit' or 'uski amaanat he' kaa latin 'credit' he
 The earliest extant evidence of complete double-entry bookkeeping is the 1299–1300 Farolfi ledger
 giovano ferolfi and company mahatvapurn florentine vyapaariyon kaa ek form tha jiskaa pramukh karyaalay nimes main tha jo unke sabase mahatvapurn graahak arles ke arqbishap ke sahuukaar ke rup main bhi kaam karata tha
 The earliest record of the double entry system as a whole has been discovered as an account of the city of Genoa in Messari, 1340 AD
 messari ke khaaton main debit or credit rojnaamachaa pravishti ke dwipaksheeya praaroop main or adhishesh ko pichley varsh se aage badhaakar shaamil kiya gaya he or isliye dohari pravishti kii ek aam manyata ke rup main sweekrut he
 Luca Pacioli's "summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita" was first printed and published in Venice in 1494
 isamen bukkiping par 27 prishth kaa ek shodh-granth, "particularis de computis at scrypturis" shaamil tha
 It was first written for merchants and then sold mainly to those who used the sources of happiness contained in it as a reference book for mathematical puzzles, and also as an aid to their sons' education
 yah bahikhaata par pehla gyaat mudrit granth kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or vyapak rup se ise aadhunik bahikhaata kii karypranali kaa agradoot mana jaataa he
 In Summa Arithmetica, Pacioli introduced symbols for yoga and disconnection in the first printed book, symbols that became the notation standard in Italian Renaissance mathematics
 Summa Arithmetica is known as the first book contained algebra printed in Italian
 haalanki luka pasioli ne dohari pravishti vaali bahikhaata kii khoj nahin kii, is vishay par gyaat 27 prishth vaale bukkiping ke prakashit shodh prabandh main unhone isaki charchaa kii or kaha jaataa he ki dohari pravishti vaali bahikhaata kii unhone hi neenv rakhi jo aajkal prachlit he
 Although the originality in Pacioli's thesis is almost non-existent, it is generally considered an important work, especially because of its wide circulation, written in the local Italian language and printed in the book
 pasioli ke anusaar, lekha, vyapaaree dwaara sanrachit ek tadarth aadesh pranali he
 Its regular use provides the trader with regular information about his business and gives him a chance to evaluate how things are made and work accordingly
 Pacioli advises the Venetian method of double-entry bookkeeping above all other methods
 is pranali ke pratyaksh aadhaar par teen pramukh pustak hai: memoriel, giornell or quaderno 
 khaataa ko ek kendriya aadhaar mana jaataa he or iske saath ek varnanukram anukramanika hoti he
 Pacioli's thesis instructs how to record barter transactions and transactions in different varieties of currencies - this was possible because both were far more common than they are today

 The nature of double entry can be identified by noting that in this system of bookkeeping, they not only keep a record of the goods sold and sold, but can also calculate assets or profit and loss in their business; Instead, writing in double entry also overtook the effects of transcription and computation
 One of its social effects was to prove to the merchants their integrity as a class; One of its epistemological implications was the creation of its formal precision based on a rule bound system of arithmetic realization guaranteeing the accuracy of the descriptions it recorded

 maury rajvansh pracheen bharat kaa ek shaktishaalee evam mahaan rajvansh shakya vansh se avatareet tha 
 It ruled India for 137 years
 isaki sthapana kaa shrey chandragupta maury or uske mantri kautilya ko diya jaataa he, jinhone nand vansh ke samraat ghananand jo ki chandragupta maury ke shotele bhai ko parajeet kiya
 The credit of expanding and strengthening the Mauryan Empire goes to Emperor Ashoka
 yah samrajya purv main magadh rajya main ganga nadi ke maidaanon se shuru hua
 Its capital was Pataliputra
 chandragupta maury ne 322 isa purv main is samrajya kii sthapana kii or teji se pashchim kii taraf apana samrajya kaa vikaas kiya
 He took advantage of the differences of several small regional states which were born after the invasion of Alexander
 316 isa purv tak maury vansh ne puure uttari pashchimi bharat par adhikaar kar liya tha
 The Maurya dynasty greatly expanded in the kingdom of Chakravarti Emperor Ashoka
 samraat ashok ke kaaran hi maury samrajya sabase mahaan evam shaktishaalee banakar vishvabhar main prasiddh hua
 In 325 BCE, northwestern India was ruled by the satrap of Sikandar
 jab sikandar punjab par chadhaai kar rahaa tha to ek brahman jiskaa naam chanakya tha magadh ko samrajya vistaar ke liye protsaahit karne aayaa
 At that time, Magadha was quite powerful and pricked the eyes of its neighboring states
 par tatkaaleen magadh ke samraat ghananand ne usko thukraa diya
 He said that you are a pundit and take care of your peak "war is the king's job, you are a pundit, only do panditai"
 Since then Chanakya took a vow that he would teach Dhanananda a lesson
 maury pracheen kshatriya kabeeley ke hisse rahe he
 According to Greek sources such as Brahmin literature, Visakhadatta Mudrarakshas and Justin, etc
, there were no opinions of historians about the origin of Maurya
 Some scholars also believe that Chandragupta Maurya has originated from his mother Mura
 Maurya is, they were the clan that followed the peacocks
 parantu yah bhi sateek nahi baithta bhartiya itihaas main yah pehali baar hua mata ke naam se putr kaa vansh chalaa ho maury ek shaktishaalee vansh tha vah unke pita se viraasat main mili thi putr kaa naam pita se hi judaa hota he, unki utpatti vrushal vansh se huyi thi, lekin iskaa koi bhi pramaan itihaas main uplabdh nahin he yah keval tark he kuki ajtak itihaas main kisi ne bhi apane vansh kaa naam mata ke naam se nahin rakhaa, to kuch itihaaskaaro kaa yah sirf anumaan he
 
 chandragupta usee gana pramukh kaa putr tha jo kii chandragupta ke bal avasthaa main hi yoddha ke rup main maaraa gaya
 Chandragupta had the natural qualities to become a king ', seeing this ability, Chanakya made him his disciple, and laid the foundation of a strong nation which is an ideal till date
 iske baad bharat bhar main jasuson kaa ek jaal sa bicha diya gaya jisase raja ke khilaaf gaddari ityadi kii gupt soochna ekatra karne main kiya jaataa tha - yah bharat main shaayad abhootpurv tha
 Once this happened, he prepared Chandragupta to drive away the Greek satraps
 is kaary main use guptcharon ke vistrut jaal se madad mili
 In the invasion of Magadha, Chanakya provoked civil war in Magadha
 uske guptcharon ne nand ke adhikariyon ko rishwat dekar unhe apane paksh main kar liya
 After this, the Nanda ruler left his post and Chanakya got Vijayashree
 nand ko nirvasit jivan jeena padaa jiske baad uskaa kya hua ye agyaat he
 Chandragupta Maurya also won the public's trust and with this he also got the right to power
 us samay magadh bharat kaa sabase shaktishaalee rajya tha
 After the capture of Magadha, Chandragupta occupied the center of power
 chandragupta ne pashchimi tathaa dakshini bharat par vijay abhiyaan aarambh kiya
 Its information comes from indirect evidence
 rudradaaman ke junagarh shilaalekh main likhaa he ki sinchai ke liye sudarshan jhil par ek band pushyagupt dwaara banaaya gaya tha
 Pushyagupta was the provincial governor of Ashoka at that time
 pashchimottar bharat ko unani shashan se mukti dilaane ke baad uskaa dhyaan dakshin kii taraf gaya
 Chandragupta defeated Alexander's commander Seleucus around 305 BC
 greek vivaran is vijay kaa ullekh nahin karte hai par itnaa kehete hai ki chandragupta or celukas ke bich ek sandhi hui thi jiske anusaar celukas ne qandahar, kabul, heraat or baluchistan ke pradesh chandragupta ko de die the
 With this, Chandragupta presented him 500 elephants
 itnaa bhi kaha jaataa he chandragupta ne celukas kii beti se vaivaahik sambandh sthapit kiya tha
 Seleucus sent Megasthenes to the court of Chandragupta as ambassador
 plutark ke anusaar "sandrokotus us samay tak singhasanarudh ho chukaa tha, usne apane 6,00,000 sainikon kii sena se sampoorn bharat ko rond daalaa or apane adheen kar liya"
 This comment may be called a little exaggeration because it is known that the Cauvery river and its south areas were ruled by the Cholas, Pandyas, Satyaputras and Keralaputras at that time
 ashok ke shilaalekh karnataka main chittaldurg, yeragudi tathaa maski main paae gaye hai
 In his inscription Sermon i and Trayodash, description of his neighbors Chola, Pandya and other states is found
 chunki aisi koi jaankaree nahin milti ki ashok yaa uske pita bindusaar ne dakshin main koi yuddh ladaa ho or usamen vijay praapt kii ho atah aisa mana jaataa he unpar chandragupta ne hi vijay praapt kii thi
 In the latter part of his life, he had embraced Jainism and renounced the throne and lived a monastic life with his mentor Jainmuni Bhadrabahu in Shravanabelagola, Karnataka
 chandragupta ke baad uskaa putr bindusaar sattarudh hua par uske bare main adhik gyaat nahin he
 The extension of the empire towards the south is sometimes credited to Bindusara, although there is no evidence of his conquests
 jain parampara ke anusaar uski maan kaa naam durdhar tha or puraanon main varnit bindusaar ne 25 varshon tak shashan kiya tha
 He is also given the title of Amitraghata which is given the name of Amitrochtas in Greek texts
 bindusar aajivak dharam ko maanata tha
 He demanded a dry emperor, sweet wine and a philosopher from a Greek ruler, Antiochus I
 samraat ashok, bharat ke hi nahin balki vishwa ke itihaas ke sabase mahaan shaskaon main se ek hai
 Apart from the expansion of the empire, he is named with great rulers like Akbar in the field of administration and religious tolerance
 haalanki ve akbar se bahoot shaktishaalee evam mahaan samraat rahe he
 Many scholars even consider Emperor Ashoka as the most successful ruler in world history
 apane rajkumaar ke dinon main unhone ujjain tathaa takshashila ke vidrohon ko dabaa diya tha
 But the battle of Kalinga proved to be a turning point in his life and his mind was filled with guilt over the war massacre
 unhone buddha dharm apana liya tathaa uske prachaar ke liye bahoot kaary kiye
 Emperor Ashoka was initiated into Buddhism by Upagupta
 unhone devanapriy, priyadarshi, jaisi oopaadhi dhaaran kii
 The inscriptions and inscriptions of Emperor Ashoka have been found in various places in the Indian subcontinent
 usne dhamm kaa prachaar karne ke liye videshon main bhi apane prachaarak bheje
 The countries to which the preachers were sent included Antiochus Theos of Syria and West Asia, Ptolemy Philadelus of Egypt, Antigonus Gonatus of Macedonia, Megas of Cyrene and Alexander of Epirus

 The historical Mahendru Ghat of Patna is named after him

 This was necessary to prevent the fall of the empire from foreign invasion

 Additionally, the empire was divided into four more provinces for administration

 kautilya ne arthshaastra main nagaron ke prashasan ke bare main ek puraa adhyay likhaa he
 Scholars say that the administration of Pataliputra and other cities at that time must have been in accordance with this principle
 megasthaneez ne patliputra ke prashasan kaa varnan kiya he
 According to him the city of Pataliputra was ruled by a city council consisting of 30 members

 Each committee had a certain function
 pehali samiti kaa kaam audyogic tathaa kalatmak utpaadan se sambandhit tha

 Various types of officers were also appointed by the city council to do public welfare, such as - roads, markets, hospitals, hospitals, educational institutions, water supply, repair and maintenance of ports
 nagar kaa pramukh adhikari nagarak kehalaata tha
 Kautilya has also mentioned several departments in the city administration that used to regulate many activities of the city, such as Accounts Department, Revenue Department, Mines and Minerals Department, Chariot Department, Customs and Tax Department
