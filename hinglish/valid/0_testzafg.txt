 premachand kii rachana-drushti vibhinn sahitya roopon main pravrutt hui

 yah sthiti hindi or urdu bhashaa donon main samaan rup se dikhaayi detii he
 Premchand's novels are milestones not only in Hindi novel literature but also in Indian literature

 He originally wrote it in Urdu under the name 'bajare-hussan' but first published its Hindi form 'sevasadan'

 Premchand had started a revolutionary change in Hindi fiction by making Surdas, a blind beggar, a hero of fiction in Rangbhoomi
 godaan kaa hindi sahitya hi nahin, vishwa sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan he
 In it, Premchand's literary ideology achieves perfection from 'idealistic realism' to 'critical realism'
 ek saamaanya kisaan ko puure upanyaas kaa nayak bananaa bhartiya upanyaas parampara kii disha badal dene jaisaa tha
 The death of Hori, a storyline trapped in the cycle of feudalism and capitalism, shakes the minds of readers
 kisaan jivan par apane pichley upanyaason 'premashram' or 'karmbhumi' main premanchad yatharth kii prastuti karte-karte upanyaas ke ant tak adarsh kaa daaman tham lete hai
 But Godan's tactful ending is a witness to the fact that Premchand was disillusioned with idealism by then
 yah unki aakhri daur kii kahaniyon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Mangalasutra is an unfinished novel of Premchand
 premchand ke upanyaason kaa mul kathy bhartiya gramin jivan tha

 premchand ji kii lokapriy kahaniyaan Premchand composed the plays 'sangram', 'karbala' and 'prem ki Vedi'
 ye naatak shilp or samvednaa ke str par achche hai lekin unki kahaniyon or upanyaason ne itani oonchaai praapt kar lee thi ki naatak ke kshetra main premchand ko koi khaas safalataa nahin mili
 These plays have become really interactive novels

, while editing magazines and magazines in the then other co-existing literary magazines 'chand', 'maryada', 'swadesh' etc

 unke dwaara ratannath sarshar ke urdu upanyaas 'fasaan-e-aaazaad' kaa hindi anuwaad 'aaazaad katha' bahut mashhoor hua
 Premchand came to Hindi with the rite of Urdu and became a great Hindi writer
 hindi ko apana khaas muhaavara or khulaapan diya
 Both the story and the novel made epoch-making changes
 unhone sahitya main samayikta prabal aagrah sthapit kiya
 He made the common man the subject of his creations and, by openly penning his problems, placed him on the post of heroes of literature
 premchand se pehle hindi sahitya raja-rani ke kisson, rahasy-romaanch main ulajhaa hua tha
 Premchand took literature to the surface of truth
 unhone jivan or kalkhand kii sachai ko panne par utaara
 He continued to write for a lifetime on communalism, corruption, zamindari, indebtedness, poverty, colonialism
 premachand kii zyaadaatar rachanaaen unki hi garibi or dainyata kii kahani kahati he
 It is also not wrong that he was the creator of the common Indian
 unki rachanaaon main ve nayak hue, jise bhartiya samaaj achhut or ghrunit samajha tha
 He used the language of simple, easy and common language and presented his progressive ideas strongly to the society
 1936 main pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke pehle sammelan kii adhyakshata karte hue unhone kaha ki lekhak swabhaav se pragatisheel hota he or jo aisa nahin he vah lekhak nahin he
 Premchand is the era promoter of Hindi literature
 unhone hindi kahani main aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad kii ek nai parampari shuru kii
 Despite being such a great creator, Premchand's life is not free from accusations
 premchand ke adhyeta kamalkishor goyanka ne apni pustak 'premchand : adhyayan kii nai dishaaen' main premchand ke jivan par kuch aarope lagaakar unke sahitya kaa mahatv kam karne kii koshish kii
 The main allegations against Premchand are- Premchand left his first wife without any reason and even after second marriage, he had a relationship with another woman, Premchand cheated Vinodashankar Vyas in 'jagran Brawl', Premchand's senior press Employee Pravasi Lal Verma Frauded, Workers Strike in Premchand's Press, Premchand Supports Flick When His Daughter Sick Took more
 kamalkishor goyanka dwaara lagaae gaye ye aarope premchand ke jivan kaa ek paksh jarur hamaare saamne laate hai jisamen unki insaani kamajoriyon jaahir hoti hai lekin unke vyapak sahitya ke moolyankan par in aaropon kaa koi asar nahin pad paaya he
 Premchand is often known as "munshi Premchand"
 premchand ke naam ke saath 'munshi' kab or kaise jud gaya? is vishay main adhikansh log yahi maan lete hai ki prarambh main premchand adhyaaapak rahe
 The teachers were often called Munshi ji at that time
 iske atirikt kaaysthon ke naam ke pehle sammaan swaroop 'munshi' shabd lagane kii parampara rahi he
 Probably, the word Munshi became rigid with the name of Premchand ji
 professor shukdev singh ke anusaar premchand ji ne apane naam ke aage 'munshi' shabd kaa prayog swayan kabhi nahin kiya
 He also believes that the word Munshi is a sign of respect, which fans of Premchand may have once imposed
 yah tathy anumaan par aadhaarit he
 But the authentic reason for adding the Munshi adjective to Premchand's name is that the letter 'hans' used to co-edit Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 jisaki kuch pratiyon par kanhaiyalaal munshi kaa puraa naam na chhapakar maatr 'munshi' chapa rahata tha saath hi premchand kaa naam is prakaar chapa hota tha- 
 Editor Munshi, premchand'hans' editors were Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 parantu kalantar main pathakon ne 'munshi' tathaa 'premchand' ko ek samaj liya or 'premchand'- 'munshi premchand' ban gaye
 It's but natural
 saamaanya pathak praaia: lekhak kii kritiyon ko padhata he, naam kii sookshmata ko nahin dekha karata
 Today, Premchand's ornamentation of Premchand has become so orthodox that it is only by 'munshi' that Premchand's realization is made and by not saying 'munshi', Premchand's name seems incomplete
 premchand ne apni kala ke shikhar par pahunchne ke liye anek prayog kiye
 In the era in which Premchand took the pen, there was no solid legacy behind him nor was there any model of thought and progress, except in Bengali literature
 us samay bankim babu the, sharathchandra the or iske alaava tollstoy jaise rusi sahityakar the
 But by the time he composed a classic novel like Godan which is considered a modern classic
 unhone chizon ko khud gadha or khud aakaar diya
 When the freedom movement of India was going on, the expression he gave to both Hindi and Urdu languages through narrative literature gave rise to political stirring, passion and movement to all and made him powerful and this also made his writing powerful
 premchand is arth main nishchit rup se hindi ke pehle pragatisheel lekhak kahe ja sakate hai
 In 1936, he addressed the first conference of the Progressive Writers' Association as the Chairman
 unka yahi bhaashan pragatisheel andolan ke ghoshnaa patr kaa aadhaar bana
 Premchand gave birth to a tradition of storytelling in Hindi and an entire generation followed in his footsteps, Renu, Nagarjuna and after him Srinath Singh has written stories of rural environment in the 50-60s, in a way that tradition of Premchand Comes in line with premchand ek krantikari rachanaakaar the, unhone na keval deshbhakti balki samaaj main vyaapt anek kuritiyon ko dekha or unako kahani ke madhyam se pehali baar logon ke samaksh rakhaa
 He began to portray all the problems of society at that time
 usamen dalit bhi aate hai, nari bhi aati hai
 All these subjects later became major discourses of Hindi literature

 These folk songs were sung and danced by young men, young men, adults and elders, in the rhythm of fast motion like Deepchandi, Dhumali and Kabhi Aadha in the free atmosphere of the villages

 unhone hori naamak loakgeet braj kaa liya or usko gyaan kii agni main tapaakar dhaal diya
 In the mold of ancient Charachari arrangements, which were sung in the Charachari rhythm itself
 hori gayan kaa priy taal aadi chachar dipachandi ban gaya
 Hori's restriction remained undone, it was fixed in various ragas
 gayan style vahi lok sangeet ke aadhaar par pehle vilambit ant main drut gati main purvadhrith taal se hat kar kaharava taal main hoti he or shrota ko rasavibhoot kar detii he
 Nayak Baiju shortened the composition of the Dhams
 isaki gayan style kaa aadhaar dhruvpad jaisaa hi rakhaa gaya
 The subject of the narrative was related to phag and rasa was adornment, that too coincidence
 viyog shringaar ko dhamaar bahut kam sthaan praapt hai
 The purpose of this style was to create a romantic atmosphere

 The method of coating metals by electric current is called electrolysis
 bahudhaa lohe kii vastuon ko sanksharan se bachaane tathaa chamak ke liye, un par taanbe, nikal athwa chromium kaa lepan kiya jaataa he
 After the base metal is coated, the outer properties of the metal being coated are visible
 isse vastu kaa bahari rup rang nikhar jaataa he tathaa saath hi vastu sanksharan se bhi bachati he
 The metal to be coated by electrolysis is well attached to the base metal and coating can often be done in a permanent way
 vidyutlepan sajja ke mukhya ansh nimnlikhit hai - 1
 Electrophoresis bath - filled with a metal compound to be coated, which breaks down into metal ions as the current flows and these ions get coated on the base metal surface
 2
 disht dhara kaa strot - yah saamanyat: ek dishtakaari hota he or prayavarti dhara ko disht dhara main badalata he
 3
 The base metal object to be coated - it is associated with the loan terminal of the stream
 dhan terminal anode se sambhddha hota he, jo lepan kii janevaali dhaatu ke yogic main duba rahata he
 When current flows between the two terminals, the metallic silver ions move toward the bottom of the cathode and are converted into metallic form and cling to the bottom
 lepan kii motaai dhara ke ghanatv evam lepan ke kaal par nirbhar karti he
 The direct current can be used for electrification, otherwise there will be no ablative action
 jahaan sambharan prayavarti dhara kaa hota he vahaan ise disht dhara main parivartit karnaa aavashyak hota he
 This can be done by directional or motor-generator sets
 kisi vastu par vidyutlepan karne se pehle, use acchhee prakaar saaf kiya jaataa he
 There should not be any kind of oily substance, grease, or dust particles on it, otherwise the coating will not be strong
 saaf karne ke liye kuch rasinic vilyanon kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he or unase dhone ke baad, dhatviya oxidon ko hataane ke liye, lepan kii janevaali vastu ko salphurik amla athwa hydrochloric amla ke tanu vilyan main daal diya jaataa he
 After that, the object is hung in the lapan vath as a cathode to be coated
 lepan bath, saamanyat: achaalak padaarth kii tank ke rup main hota he, jisamen lepan kii janevaali dhaatu kaa rasinic vilyan bharaa hota he
 For copper coating, this solution is of copper sulphate
 nikal lepan ke liye nikal salphet kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Some of their other chemical compounds are used for their specific coating
 vaise to koi bhi dhaatu, kisi duusari dhaatu par lepit kii ja sakati he, parantu vyaavhaarik rup main adhikanshat: lohe kii vastuon par tamra, nikal athwa chromium kaa lepan kiya jaataa he or taanbe tathaa pital kii vastuon par chaandi athwa sone kaa lepan kiya jaataa he
 Lapan has another practical difficulty
 yadi kisi sakriy dhaatu ko aise dhaatu ke yogic ke vilyan main daal diya jaae jisamen aayan prachur maatra main hon, to pruthakkaran kriya hone lagati he
 Such coatings are not durable
 taanbe yaa pital par chaandi-sone kaa lepan karne main bhi yahi kathinaayee hoti he inamen prayog honevaale rasinic vilyanon kaa sanghatan bahut santulit rakhaa jaataa he
 In lapan vath, in general, another compound, called additive factor, is added
 gond, gelatin, albumin aadi saamaanya prayog main aanevaale yojit kaarak hai
 Copper cyanide is also used in place of copper sulphate in copper coating
 ise bahudhaa ispaat par pehla tamra aavaran dene ke liye prayog karte hai or baad main tamra aavaran par nikal athwa chromium kaa lepan kiya jaataa he
 In copper coating also, the first cover is given by copper sulphate after copper cyanide gives the first cover
 chamak paidaa karne ke liye, saadharantaya, kuch sodium thayoslphet bhi lepan bath main mila diya jaataa he
 The stream density is about 100 amperes per square meter for good and durable coating

 Evidence of the emergence of Western poetry appears from eight centuries before Christ
 homer or hesiod jaise mahakaviyon ke kavy main paashchaatya kavyashastreey chintan ke praarambhik bindu maujuud milte hai
 In Greece, orators were of great importance
 samiksha kii drushti se us samay kii frags tathaa clouds jaisi kuch natyakritiyaan kaafii mahatvapurn or ullekhneey hai
 In Frags, the question has been asked about the poem, why is it considered excellent? Poetry is important for society because of its useful inspiration and entertainment or because of providing pleasure and entertainment? In this way, the poetic ideas of thought existed long ago in Greek society and systematic poetry review began with Plato
 plato ne kavy kii saamaajik upadeyata kaa siddhant pratipaadit kiya
 According to him, poetry should spread lofty human values
 devataaon tathaa veeron kii stuti evam prashansa kavy kaa mukhya vishay hona chahie
 Poetry-character should be such that by following it, ideal citizenship can be obtained
 plato ne jab apane samay tak praapt kavy kii samiksha kii to unhen yah dekh kar ghor niraashaa hui ki kavita kalpana par aadhaarit he
 It makes the citizens weak instead of giving them the best inspiration and ideas
 plato ke vichaar se suvyavasthit rajya main kalpanapranav kaviyon ko rakhana thik nahin hoga, kyonki is prakaar ke kalakaar juthi bhavatmakataa ubhaar kar vyakti kii tark-shakti kunthit kar dete he jisase bhale-bure kaa vivek samaapt ho jaataa he
 Plato's art and poetic discussion led to the incorporation of copy-theory into aesthetic and poetic thinking
 unke anusaar kavy, sahitya or kala jivan or prakruti kaa kisi na kisi rup main anukaran he
 According to Plato, who considers poetry to be a form of art, poets and artists emulate the images and images of original objects or characters, imitating them
 ve us vastu yaa charitra kii vaastaviktaa kaa gyaan nahin rakhte
 Plato, who considers the arts and poems to be inferior, considers two sides of imitation - the first which is followed and the second the form of imitation
 agar anukaran kaa tatva mangalakaari he or anukaran purna evam uttam he to vah swaagat yogya he
 But often the permissible object is incompatible and sometimes the imitation of the magmatic object is incomplete and incomplete
 aisi dasha main kala satya se pare or hanikaarak hoti he
 Later, Plato's disciple Aristotle, while considering the arts as imitative, accepted his importance
 yah plato ke vichaaron se bhinn drushti thi
 While Plato's ideas are moral and social, Aristotle's vision is aesthetic
 unhone virechan-siddhant prastut kiya
 According to this theory, the successful and effective replication of serious actions is not in the form of narration, but in the form of actions that involve compassion and fear-provoking events that provide a relief and pleasure through the catharsis of these expressions
 arestu ke vichaar se bhay or karunaa ke do bhav hamaare bheetar ghaneebhoot hote rahete hai
 On seeing this type of tragedy, these expressions are balanced and adjusted by efficient acting and thus our mind feels relief and joy
 kavita yaa naatak ke paatro ke bich in uttejit vaasanaon or uske dushprinaamon kaa hamaare sharir or jivan se sidhaa sambandh na hone ke kaaran ye vasanaye parishkrut samvednaaon kaa rup grahan karti hai
 This is the arbitration of emotions and this is the real effect and function of poetry
 arestu ne kaha ki kavy kalpana par aadhaarit hoti he
 It is not a depiction of reality, but its basis is likely
 kavy vastav main anukaran he kintu yahi uski vishistataa he
 But the poet reconstructs things, not imitations
 anukaran ke kaaran hi kavy aanandadaayak hota he
 He can get education but his purpose is not to provide education
 is prakaar arestu ne plato ke kavy sambandhi vichaaron evam aaropon kaa nirakan kiya
 The name of Longinus, a representative poeticist in the field of Greek poetry review after Plato and Aristotle, also comes prominently
 unhone audaatya-siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya
 The concept of Longinus' theory also included subjects such as non-literary history, philosophy and religion
 unke anusaar audaatya vaani kaa utkarsh, kanti or vaishishty he jiske kaaran mahaan kaviyon, itihaaskaaron, darshanikon ko pratishtha sammaan or khyaati praapt hui he
 Due to this, his works have become dignified and his influence has been distinguished from time to time
 unhone ‘udaatt’ ko kavy kaa pramukh tatva mana
 According to him, the sublimeness of thoughts, the sublimeness of expressions, the sublimeness of figures, the sublimeness of word-structure and the sublimeness of syntax make any poetry superior
 ek shreshth kavita logon ko anand pradaan karti he tathaa divya-lok main pahunchaati he
 This theory greatly influenced the western world
 dhire-dhire samay ke saath unani samiksha kamazor padane lagi or roman samiksha kaa prabhaav badha
 Rome became the center of discussions on art, literature and culture
 vahaan ke siciro tathaa virgil jaise samikshakon ne paashchaatya kavyashastra main ullekhneey yogadan diya
 Horace said that there must be harmony and justification in poetry
 kavy main shreshth vichaaron ke saamanjasy ke saath hi puraatan evam naveen kaa samanvay hona chahie
 The poet should be alert and attentive to the excellence of both the emotional and artistic aspects of poetry
 paanchavin se lekar pandrahavin shatabdi ke samay ko paashchaatya kavyashastra kii drushti se andhayug mana jaataa he
 During this period poetry and review were badly affected due to the influence of the church and the priests
 kavy main upedshaatmakataa ko adhik mahatva diya gaya
 Dante is prominent among the poets of this period
 unka samay 1265 se 1391 ke bich kaa mana gaya he
 He considered the dignified level public language most suitable for poetry
 kavy main jan- bhashaa ke agrahi dante ne kaha ki pratibha ke saath hi kavi ke liye parishram or abhyaas bhi aavashyak he
 According to him, high thoughts, national love, human love and beauty give importance to poetry
 madhyayugin samiksha carch or padariyon ke prabhaav main upadeshaatmak ho gayi thi
 In the Renaissance or Renaissance period, Sydney and Ben Johnson liberated him
 sidney ne kaha ki adikaal se ab tak kavita hi gyaan-vigyaan ke prasar kaa madhyam rahi he tathaa isaki upyogita prayek paristhiti main bani rahegi
 The purpose of poetry is to teach goodness and provide pleasure
 prakruti ke anukaran kaa arth nakal nahin balki use bhavyatam rup main prastut kar prakruti ke prati anuraag utpann karnaa he
 Its real meaning is creativity
 isi kaal ke duusare prasiddh sameekshak ben johnson ne bhautikta ke nirvaah par bal diya tathaa clasik sahitya ke anukaran tathaa anushilan ko rekhaankit kiya
 The period between the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries is known as Neoclassical Review

 Under this, the poet-imagination was given importance in poetry
 aatmanubhuti kii abhivyakti par adhik bal tathaa kavy ke bhav paksh ko centre main rakhaa gaya
 Considering the purpose of poetry as self-happiness and pleasure, inspiration, talent and imagination gained prominence in Romantic poetry
 is samiksha siddhant main vastusthiti tathaa tathyaparakata kaa aagrah tha
 Due to the novelty of literature, the tendency to reject ancient literary norms, traditions and stereotypes, and the urge for artistic innovation, there was a lot of development of economicism, and later on from this womb, progressism, socialist orthodoxy and psychological orthodoxy developed
 is ke anusaar kala kala ke liye hai
 Creation is not for any accomplishment

 Under this, special emphasis was placed on the originality and novelty of cognition

 Words are more important than meaning

 In 1886, the poet Jean Moreas published a manifesto of symbolism in a letter called Figaro

 Poetry is not for the general public but for those who can understand it
