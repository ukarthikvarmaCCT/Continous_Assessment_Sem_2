 Shivagami tells the bewildered crowd outside the palace that Amarendra is dead and now his son Mahendra Bahubali will be the new king

 jis jamaane main unhone kaary shuru kiya us samay kaa vaataavaran hindi ke liye atyant pratikul tha
 She was neglected in the areas of government work and education etc

 Shyam Sundar Das devoted his entire life to Hindi-service

 shyaam sundar das jivan ke antim kshan tak sahitya-seva main sakriy rahe
 Just before and after independence, the entire generation of Hindi grew only by sitting on Babuji's shoulders
 samay-samay par vibhinn vishyon par sammelnon main diye jane vaale unke vaktavyon kii sankhya anginat he
 Looking at all this thinking, it becomes clear how they wanted to pursue Hindi literature by connecting it with many subjects
 aaj bhi babuji kii bahut badi dein he paathya-saamagree kii pramanik rachana tathaa adhyayan ke kshetra kaa vivek
 His every minute effort to bring fresh material to the students resulted in his becoming a collector
 aalochana kii jaati he ki isi kaaran unke lekhan main gahraayi or moulikta kaa abhaav hota gaya
 But it remains to be seen that his syncretic intelligence was engrossed in the material collection of many knowledge fields
 yahan tak ki vyaavhaarik-aalochana main bhi babuji ne saamanjasywad kaa saundarya sthapit kiya
 That is why comparison, historical view, interpretation, commentary etc
 entered his criticism
 is tarah hindi main vyaavhaarik-aalochana kaa aarmabhik maarg bhi unhone taiyaar kiya
 His efficient leadership later proved to be a boon for the Hindi-speaking region
 babu shyaam sundar das ne vichaaratmak tathaa bhavatmak donon hi ek prakaar ke niabandh likhe hai
 There is enough variety in the subject of his essays
 unhone bahut se achoote vishyon par bhi lekhnee chalaai kaviyon kii khoj tathaa itihaas sambandhi nibandhon main unki pratibha ke darshan hote hai
 The language of Babu Shyam Sundar Das is pure literary Hindi, in which the corresponding words of Sanskrit are predominant
 bhashaa ke sambandh main unka vichaar tha- 'jab ham videshi bhaavon ke saath videshi shabdon ko grahan karen tab unhen aisa bana len ki unamem se videshipan nikal jaae or ve apane hokar hamaare vyakaran ke niyamon se anushaasit hon
 'therefore, wherever they have used the prevalent words of' Urdu 'in their language, they have removed their character, they have used them by removing the dots under the words pen, drill, law etc
 and changing their pronunciation
 isi prakaar sanskrit ke shabdon kii clishtataa dur kar ke unhen hindi main saral dhang se likhaa he- jaise- kaary ke sthaan par kaary, anjan ke sthaan par anjan
 Babu Shyamsunder Das was of the opinion about the word selection- 'the first place is the words of pure Hindi, behind it the easy and popular words of Sanskrit, behind it the simple and popular words of foreign languages like Persian and behind it the obsolete of Sanskrit
 Let the words be spaced
 farsi aadi videshi bhashaaon ke kathin shabdon kaa prayog kadaapi na ho
 Babu Shyam Sundar Das has written mainly in two types of styles - 1
 vichaaratmak style- vichaaratmak style main vichaaratmak niabandh likhe gaye hai
 The sentences in this style are short and expressive
 bhashaa sabal, saral or pravahamayi he
 For example- 'gopiyo kaa sneh badhaya he
 They are compiled with Krishna in Ras Leela
 anek utsav manaati he
 This behavior of Premmayi gopikas is very delightful
 usamen kahin se aswabhaaviktaa nahin aa saki
 2
 Exploratory Style - The explanatory style is used in exploratory essays
 inamen vaakya apekshaakrit kuch lambey hai
 There is a plethora of corresponding words in the language
 vishay kii gahanta tathaa shushkta ke kaaran yah style main kuch shushk or rahit he
 See an example of this type of style- 'yah jivan-sangram do bhinn sabhyataaon ke sangharshan se or bhi teevr or dukhamay prathit hone laga he
 According to this condition, when literature is generated and encouraging the brain of the society, then only the signs of real progress will be seen and its welfare will give the country the glory of modern times
 babu shyaam sundardaas kii kisi prakaar kii style main alankaaron kii sajaavat nahin pai jaati
 Sayings and idioms have been used sparingly
 apane vichaaron ko bhalee prakaar samajhane ke liye babu shyaam sundar das ne ek hi baat ko 'saransh yah he' 'athwa', 'jaise' aadi shabdon ke saath baar-baar duharaaya he
 In Hindi literature, Babu Shyam Sundar Das has been replaced as his Hindi promoter and Hindi director
 unhone anek moulik granthon kii rachana kii
 Edited many texts
 kaashi nagari-prachaarini sabha kii sthapana main unka pramukh haath tha
 He made Hindi a place in the higher classes of the university with his efforts
 kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay main aane se purv unhone 1900 main hindi sahitya kii samruddhi ke liye nyaayalayon main hindi ke pravesh kaa andolan chalaaya
 Till 1900, Shyamsunder Das edited the Saraswati magazine
 unhone hastlikhit granthon kii khoj kii tathaa hindi shabdhsagar kaa bhi sampaadan kiya
 In 1902, the building of the Nagar Pracharini Sabha was also constructed under his supervision
 1907 main unhone hindi arya bhashaa pustkaalay kii sthapana kii, pracheen mahatvapurn granthon kaa sampaadan kiya or shiksha str ke anuroop paathya pustakon kaa nirmaan kaary bhi aarambh kiya
 Ramchandra Shukla has written in the history of Hindi literature: shyaam sundar das na keval santhaan-nirmaataa the, balki prabandh-kala main bhi bejod the
 He worked determinedly to overcome the shortages of all areas of literature
 bhashaa tatvavetta ke rup main yaa siddhanton ke vyaakhyaata rup main unheen kii uplabdhiyon ke kaaran saahityalochan hindi ke vidhyaarthiyon kaa bahut samay tak kanthhaar bana rahaa
 In his mind, the notion remained that the basis of the theoretical review of Hindi should be made by combining Sanskrit and Western criticism-principles and with a special harmony
 shyaam sundar das se pehle hindi or nagari lipi ke liye vishesh rup se sankatpurna samay tha
 Pratap Narayan Mishra had established meetings for the promotion of Hindi in many places
 aisi hi ek sabha 1884 main ‘hindi uddharini pratinidhi madhya bharat sabha’ ke naam se prayag main pratishthit kii gayi
 Bharatendu Harishchandra also ventured several times for Nagari's entry into government offices, but he could not succeed
 iske baavjood praytn baraabar chalata rahaa
 Due to the court language being Urdu, the number of newly educated Urdu readers was more, due to which the work of publishing Hindi books could not proceed
 is sahitya-sankat ke atirikt nagari kaa pravesh sarkari dacrataron main na hone se nagari jaanane vaali janata ke saamne ghor sankat tha
 In the same period, Kashi Nagari Pracharini Sabha was established in 1893 from the industry of some enthusiastic students, among whom Babu Shyam Sundar Das was the chief
 yahan bhi ramchandra shukla kaa kathan yaad rakhana chahie ki, ‘sach puuchhie to is sabha kii sari samruddhi or kirti babu shyaam sundar das ke tyaag or satat parishram kaa fal he
 They continued to do it from the beginning till the end and kept it ready in many big industries
 iske pratham sabhapati bhaaratendu ke fufere bhai radhakrishna das hue
 The Nagari Prachar movement created new enthusiasm among Hindi-lovers and many people became devoted to the growth of literature

 Linguistically, Formosi languages are important because many linguists believe that 9 of the ten main branches of Austronesian languages are found in these Formosi languages of Taiwan and only one branch is found outside Taiwan

 The knowledge of the actions that take place in the body revealed that their form is very chemical and these phenomena are the result of the chemical activities
 jyon-jyon khojein huin tyon-tyon sharir kii ghatnaon kaa rasinic rup saamne aata gaya
 In this way, chemistry became so important that it became a separate branch of medicine, which was named biochemistry
 iske dwaara na keval shaareerik ghatnaon kaa rup spasht hua, varan rogon kii utpatti tathaa unke pratirodh kii vidhiyaan bhi nikal ain
 At the same time, physics also helped in understanding physical phenomena very well
 yah gyaat hua ki anek ghatnaayen bhautik niyamon ke anusaar hi hoti hai
 Like biochemistry, biophysics has also become a part of medical science and it has also helped in understanding the origin of diseases and in resisting them
 vigyaan kii anya shakhaon se bhi rogrodhan tathaa chikitsa main bahut sahaayta mili he
 And with the help of all these, a lot of progress has been made in the welfare of human beings, which has resulted in increased lifespan

 But the result of this in-depth study is that medical science is divided into many branches and so much discovery has been made in each branch, new tools have been made and experimental methods have been known that no scholar or student can be fully familiar with them all
 
 din--prati--din chikitsak ko prayogshaalaon tathaa yantron par nirbhar rahanaa pad rahaa he or yah nirbharta uttarottar bad rahi he
 The goal of every education is the mental development of a human being, so that it can generate the power to reason and understand and manifest and implement its emotions accordingly
 ayurvigyaan kii shiksha kaa bhi yahi uddeshy he
 For this, among all medical students, the student has to spend five years as an undergraduate
 medical collejon main vidhyaarthiyon ko aadhaar vigyaanon kaa adhyayan karke ucch madhyamik shiksha praapt karne par bharti kiya jaataa he
 After that the first two years, the student studies the basic principles called anatomy and physiology, so that he becomes aware of the natural condition of the body
 iske pashchaat teen varsh rogon ke kaaran in swaabhaavik dashaon kii vikrutiyaan kaa gyaan paane tathaa unki chikitsa kii reeti seekhney main vyateet hote hai
 Measures to prevent diseases and pharmacopoeia, which is the policy related branch of this science, he studies during this period
 in paanch varshon ke adhyayan ke pashchaat vah snaatak banataa he
 After this, he works in a department according to his interest for one year and obtains functional knowledge of that subject
 tatpashchaat vah snatakottar shikshan main diploma yaa degree lene ke liye kisi vibhaag main bharti ho saktaa he
 All medical colleges belong to one or the other university which conducts their examinations and courses and aims to generate the power of reasoning in science students and inaugurate new science mysteries

 Here he does not get all the tools of help which he had seen during his teaching period and which he had learned to use

 When required, he has to seek the help of a specialist or send the patient to the hospital

 In this way, special treatment is available by experts in heart disease, mental diseases, astigmatism, pediatric etc

 Essential examinations, valuable drugs, methods of medicine and equipment are the main reasons for the diagnosis of the disease
 aadhunik ayurvigyaan ke kaaran janata kaa jeevankaal bhi bad gaya he, parantu aushadhiyon par bahut vyay hota he
 It is to be regretted that due to the present economic conditions, proper treatment has gone beyond the power of ordinary human beings
