 Temperature is the measure of the heat of an object

 For example, if the temperature of one object is 20 degrees and that of another object is 40 degrees, then it can be said that the second object is warmer than the first object
 ek anya udhaaharan - yadi bangalore main, 4 agast 2006 kaa ausat taapmaana 29 degree tha or 5 agast kaa taapmaana 32 degree; to bangalore, 5 agast 2006 ko, 4 agast 2006 kii apeksha adhik garm tha
 Based on the evolution of the molecular theory of gases, it is assumed that the temperature of an object is proportional to the average kinetic energy contained in the random motion of its microscopic particles

 germany drudh sankalp naamak adwitiya pranali ke kaaran bhi vishisht he jiske anusaar aadhe paryvekshi board main karmchaariyon ke pratinidhi hote hai
 The CEO, President, Treasurer and other officers are often chosen by the board to manage the affairs of the corporation
 shairdharakon ke simit prabhaav ke alaava, nigam bank jaise lendaaron ke madhyam se bhi niyantrit ho sakate hai

 However, in the US since 1999, commercial banks have been permitted to invest in banking through subsidiaries under the Modernization Act or the gramm-leach-billy Act

 Boilers are divided into two main classes according to their design: agni-nalika boyleron main cornesh boyler sabase puraane prakaar kaa he
 Its texture is very simple, due to which it is still used today
 isamen ek hi dhoomravahini nalika hoti he, jiske aage ke bhaag main bhatthi bani hoti he
 Nowadays this boiler is made in many measurements, from small to large
 isaki choti se choti maap vyas main chaar foot ke lambaai main 10 foot hoti he or badi se badi maap 6 foot 6 inch vyas main tathaa lambaai main 24 foot hoti he
 It has only one furnace and fumes, so in a large size boiler, the coal does not burn properly and its hot surface ratio is also low
 isliye cornesh prakaar ke boyler main do bhatthiyaan baraabar baraabar bana dene se vahi lankashair boyler kahalaane lagata he
 Their other designs are the same
 chote se chote lankashair boyler kaa vyas 5 foot, 6 inch or lambaai 16 foot hoti he, tathaa bade se bade kaa vyas 10 foot or lambaai 30 foot hoti he
 Many times three kilns are also made in it

 Therefore, instead of drums and dilapidated boilers, some of the most dilapidated instruments are being made, in which the drum is applied only for nominal vapor accumulation
