 The Compton effect is an interaction with a substance of high frequency electromagnetic radiation in which the energy of the photons is degraded by increasing free electrons and their wave amplitude increases
 prakirnit vikiran kii tarangadairghy keval prakirnan ke kone par nirbhar karti he
 In order to clarify the Compton effect, in 1923 AD, Compton and Debai independently adopted the notion that the total energy / momentum in the photon moving in a direction yaa keval thodaa sa bhaag par de saktaa he
 This causes the energy of the observed photon, which has a Planck constant, and the frequency of radiation, to be less than the incident photon's energy and increases the wavelength related to the photon
 spashtat: yah photaan-electron-takkar-praturup vikiran ke tarang siddhanth ke ekadam pratikul he
 In 1924, Burr, Kremers, and Slater suggested another model that was based on waveism
 is praturup main urjasthirataa or samvegasthirataa ke niyam vikiran or electron kii kisi ekaaki ant: kriya main lagu na hokar anek takkaron ke sankhyikeey madhya par hi lagu hote hai
 Therefore, the incident radiation is continuously scaled to correspond to the wavelength model of Tamson, but sometimes a reflect electron also emits from the scatter

 According to the compton-debye-model, the production of electrons and diffuse radiation is required simultaneously
 is yugapadiyata main kwantum yantriki ke anusaar samay anishchita lagbhag 10-21 senkad he or naveenatam prayogon main yugapadiyata samay is seemaa ke paryaapt nikat pahunch chukaa he
 Using the energy and stability of momentum in the Kapton – Debai photon model, a precise relationship is found in the directions of the reflected electron and the dispersed photon
 aadhunik prayogon se is sambandh kii santoshjanak pushti hoti he
 According to Dirac's theories of quantum mechanics, the interaction between an electromagnetic field and an electron has been explained completely differently
 is praturup main ant: kriya kii praarambhik or antim sthitiyon ke atirikt ek madhyam sthiti bhi hoti he, jisamen keval samveg hi sthir rahata he, urja nahin
 In this internal state an electron can emit a photon or absorb a photon
 at: kaanpton parinaam main do vikalpon kii shakyata he : By considering both of these options, the scattering of electromagnetic radiation of electrons has been studied and the conclusions drawn from it have been proved by modern experiments to be sufficient for the expansion of energy
 kaanpton-debaai ke nishkarsh is saamaanya nishkarshon ke vishesh rup he
 If we consider the electrons to be completely independent and stable in the dislocated material and if the incident photon has energy and the dislocated photon has energy, then using the laws of energy stability and momentum stability we get the following equations: jahaan h⁄mec is called the Compton wavelength of the electron; Its value is equal to 2

 Another study examined the inclusion of music with therapeutic upper vein exercise on pain perception of trauma victims
 Over the course of eight weeks, trauma victims participated in upper vein exercise in conjunction with one of these three conditions: song, karaoke accompaniment, and music without
 Participants participated in each condition in a random manner and prioritized their perceived suffering immediately after the session
 The results showed that although there was no significant difference in pain preference across different conditions, video observation revealed more positive effects and verbal responses when exercising upper vein with music and karaoke accompaniment

 vidyut-maapi yaa 'urjamapi' saamanyat: un sabhi upkarnon ko kaha jaataa he vidyut urja kaa maap karne ke liye prayukt hote hai
 Electrometers are often calibrated in kilowatt-hours
 kuch vidyut maapi vishesh kaaryon ke liye vyavasthit hote hai, jaise mahattam maang sansuchak, jisamen meter ke saath aisa kaal anshak hota he jo nishchit avadhi main adhiktam urja kaa nirdesh kare
 There are also some electromagnets that automatically cut off the load at the time of maximum load
 kisi nishchit avadhi main upyukt honevaali vidyut urja kii maap karne ke liye yah aavashyak he ki vidyutmapi paripath main dhara, voltata tathaa shakti gunank teenon kii uchit maap karne main tathaa unhen samaklit karke kisi nishchit avadhi main kharch honevaali urja kaa maapan kar sakane main samarth ho
 Thus any electrometer has two fractions: shakti anshak, disht dhara evam prayavarti dhara main bhinn bhinn praroop kaa hota he
 In the direct current, due to not having the power coefficient, it is sufficient to be able to multiply the current and the voltage of the power factor
 yadi voltata ko sthir maan liya jaae, to keval dhara maapan se hi kaary chal saktaa he
 In this form the electrometer becomes literally ampere-hour meter
 yah keval yahi bataata he ki nishchit avadhi main kitni dhara prayukt kii gai he
 Thus an ampere-hour implies that 1 ampere current is consumed in 1 hour at a fixed voltage
 yadhyapi banaavat main aise upkaran saral hote hai, tathaapi spashtat: voltata ke ghatane badhane se unke dwaara nirdeshit urja main galati ho jaati he
 Nevertheless, due to its simple texture, they are very suitable for general uses

 There are two magnets on either side of the disc, one of which is called a conduction magnet: and the other a brake magnet
 ghuraagra dhara ke vaahak kaa bhi kaary karata he
 The current flows through the grating to the disc and thence through the mercury to the stationary terminal on the cell
 is prakaar paripath paare main hokar puraa hota or chaalan chumbak kii uttejk kundali main se pravaahit hoti hui dhara discs par chaalan bal aropit karti he
 Disk revolves around being self-sufficient for cruises
 uskaa brake chumbak ke kshetra main paribhraman, usapar brake bal aropit karata he
 By adjusting the position of the brake-magnet, the speed of the disc can be changed
 yadi motor thik na chal rahaa ho, to roak chumbak kii sthiti kaa vyavasthaapan karke thik kiya ja saktaa he
 In the second type of ampere hour scales, the current decomposition effect is used
 kisi nishchit avadhi main, vidyut apghaty main se paarit hoti hui dhara jitna avshesh jamaa karti he, uskaa pariman paripath main upbhog kii gai urja ke anupaat main hota he
 But the meters of this type do not have strong texture and have to be arranged repeatedly
 at: is praroop ke meter adhik chalan main nahin hai
 Power meters in direct current meters are similar to wattmeters
 inamen vastut: do paripath hote hai, Being affected by the transient values of current and voltages of these two coils, the conductor of the fraction indicates the average power in the circuit

 meter, mukhyat:, do praroop ke hote hai : Both meters are actually based on their own type of wattmeter

 The calcimeter is actually like a clock, which integrates power over a certain period of time and directs energy

 While counting the revolutions of the disc in the electric scale, energy is measured
 discs athwa drum ke paribhraman ginaney ke liye ek ganaktantr hota he, jisase kul urja kaa maan padhaa ja saktaa he
 In another type of meter, only the small part of the motor is used

 The armature is also accompanied by a commutator and there are two burushes that touch
 is prakaar vah meter, vastut: motor kaa chota rup hi he
 It is called 'motor meter' for this reason, but due to its high cost and due to care difficulties, it is used very rarely
 trifage paripathon main urja maapan bhi trifage shakti maapan ke aadhaar par hi kiya jaataa he
 Like the triphase wattmeter, the power fraction is also divided into two parts and the combination is also done by two wattmeters on the basis of power efficiency
 is prakaar isamen 6 terminal haate hai or unhen trifage watametre kii bhanti hi sanyojit kiya jaataa he
 Only by adding the time fraction and counting system can it measure energy

 He studied at the University of Turin and the Berlin Observatory
 1859-1860 main unhone pulakovo vedhashala main kaam kiya or baad main brera vedhashala main chalis varshon se upar kaam kiya
 He was also a member of the Kingdom of Italy, a member of Akademia di Linci, The Academia delle Scienze di Torino and The Regio Istithutho Lombardo and is particularly known for his study of Mars
 unki bhatiji, elsa scaparelli, ek prasiddh faishneble vastra-nirmaataa bani
 Sciparelli's contributions also include his telescopic observations about Mars
 apane praarambhik anuvikshan main unhone mangal ke "samudron" or "mahadwipon" ko naam diya
 During the "great opposition" state of the planet in 1877, he noticed dense webs of linear structures on the surface of Mars, which he called "kanali" in Italian, meaning "channels" in English, but incorrectly translated "kanals"
 Has been made
 yadhyapi dwitiya shabd kritrim nirmaan ko suchit karata he, purvavarti shabd yah sanketarth detaa he ki yah bhoomi kaa prakritik vinyas bhi ho saktaa he
 This mistranslation led to various beliefs about life on Mars, as the "canals" of Mars soon became well-known, causing waves of hypothesis, speculation and folklore about the possibility of life on Mars

 But later, with the observation of the Italian astronomer Visonzo Sarulli, the scientists ensured that the famous channels were in fact mere sight
 apni pustak, life on mars main scaparelli likhte hai ki: "ham jin sahi channelon ko jaanate hai, unke bajaay hamen mitti main aise garton kii kalpana kerani chahie, jo adhik gahare naa hon, hajaaron mile sidhi disha main 100, 200 kilo meter yaa adhik chaude hon
 i have already mentioned that in the absence of rainfall on Mars, these channels may have been the main systems through which water can spread on the dry surface of the planet
 " As an observer of the solar system's bodies, Schaparelli discovered the asteroid 69 Hesperia on April 26, 1861, while working on the pair constellations, and demonstrated that the Percids and Leonids are associated with meteorite comets
 udhaaharan ke liye, unhone sabit kiya ki leonids ulkapaat kaa parikrama-path, dhoomaketu temple-tatal se mail khaataa he
