 Just a day after Narendra Modi was re-elected to power, when a book late came right in your hand, titled 'being Hindu', it is bound to get noticed
 desh bhar main jis lahar ke saath modi jitkar aae hai, vaise main kai log hindutv ke or adhik aakraamak hone kii ashankaayen jaahir kar rahe hai
 But in fact, this book by Hindol Sengupta provides a new angle of view of Hindutva
 ek bhav yah he ki hindutv saarvbhaumikta kaa sandesh detaa he
 The second sentiment is also that Hindutva is the name of a type of hysteria that targets Muslims
 aisa virodhabhas akaaran nahin he
 Nevertheless, i interpret Hindutva as a qualitative term
 iskaa matlab ''hindupan" he, hindu dharm nahin
 However Hinduism is included in that
 aise main sengupta kii yah kitaab behad praasangik kitaab he, kyonki maujuuda vakt main dharm par baat karnaa, dharm ko lekar apni baat rakhana mushkil ho gaya he
 Especially when talking about Hinduism, the matter becomes serious
 kitaab main kai saare adhyay hai or sengupta sthapit karte hai ki ishwartv sajiv or nirjeev sabamein or sab ore vyaapt he, yah pragna or aasthaa kaa sangam he
 Man is a part of nature, not its winner because the world is not created for human consumption (this means that not only humans, all creatures and flora, even land, water bodies and the atmosphere have their rights
 )hindol kaa lekhan hindupan ke nae paribhaashaon se rubaru karaati he
 It is written on the cover of the book, 'ancient Faith, New World and You'
 jaahir he ki lekhak itihaas kii bhulbhulaiya kii bajaae maujuuda vakt main hindu dharm or hindutv ke vaastavik marm ko sahaj-saral tareekon se bataane or jataane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 This book has personal experiences of Sengupta and also a thinking of the new age
 kitaab banaras ke mandiron se lekar jatil vishyon tak sahajata se bataati he
 The first chapter of the book is how to write about Hindus? This question is very present and it seems that this question may have troubled Sengupta himself
 doosraa adhyay poochta he hindu koun he or teesraa, kya cheez he jo aapako hindu banaati he
 These are the basic questions which are meant only for the aggressive and restless Hindutva flag-bearers and those who hate the word Hindu blindly and must read it
 par is kitaab kaa saatvaan adhyay vaaki thode kam research ke aadhaar par likhaa gaya he par jo meraa pasandida vishay he, jiskaa sheershak he kya hindu hone kaa arth aapkaa shaakaahaari hona he? jo log is aadhaar par hindupan ko paribhaashit karte hai wo sire se galat hai
 But Sengupta has completely missed this chapter
 vah maansaahaar ke baad sidhe govadh par aate hai or unhen lagata he ki maansaahaar kaa arth mahaj gomance bhakshan hi he
 Eating fish is also non-vegetarian and is part of the Hindu way of life, which Sengupta may have forgotten
 duusari taraf, bengal, assam bihar jaise ilaake hai jahaan maansaahaar, khaskar machhlee khaane kaa rivaaj he
 So if Sengupta could have pointed a little towards him, the book would have become deeper
 phir bhi, hindu dharm par vyapak or alag nazariye vaale is kaam ke liye sengupta vaaki badhai ke hakdaar hai
 They also say their point with scientific facts without any unnecessary comment

 Therefore, India must participate in CHOGM

 com / txme5zafm8 Senior advocate and Aam Aadmi Party leader HS Phoolka resigned from the party on Thursday
 aam aadmi party chhodane ke peeche unhone kaha ki istipha isliye diya taaki phir se anna hajaare ke andolan jaisaa movement khadaa karen
 He said that now he will fight against drug addiction in Punjab and free the SGPC (shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee) from the political party
 shuukravaar ko ek press conference main eches phulka ne kaha ki anna ke andolan se log raajnneeti main gaye, ab ve baahar aa gaye hai
 Now i will start the organization from Punjab
 nashe ke khilaaf laduunga
 SGPC has been in the possession of a political party for a long time
 meraa plan punjab main nashe ke khilaaf ladane ke liye sanghathan bananaa, SGPC ko political kabje se chhudaana he
 He said that SGPC itself will not contest elections but will form an organization
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki main aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav nahin laduunga
 HS Phoolka said that when Anna Hazare's movement started in the country eight years ago today, social workers of his region joined it and formed an organization which became a parallel to the political party
 aise sanghathan kii desh ko bahut jarurat thi
 Then it was thought that it should be converted into a political party so that more social service could be done
 phulka ne kaha ki paanch saal ke tajurbe se bahut kuch siikhaa, loksabhaa main keval 19000 voton se rah gaya or vidhansabha bade margin se jeeta
 i left the post of Leader of the Opposition for 1984 (1984 anti-sikh riot), today it seems that decision was right

 unhone kaha ki paanch saal ke raajnneeti ke tajurbe ne sikhaaya ki 2012 kaa faisla ki movement ko raajnneeti main badalen, sahi nahin tha
 Today again a movement like Anna Hazare is needed
 aise sanghathan kii jarurat he jo sach ko sach or jhooth ko jhooth kah sake
 When that organization is spoken, political parties are forced to listen
 jab phulka se is samvaadadaata ne poocha ki aap ek aise sanghathan kii baat kar rahe ho jo sach ko sach bole, jhooth ko jhooth bole
 You are also talking about fighting drugs
 to kya aam aadmi party in muddon par yaa is tarah se kaam nahin kar rahi he? is par phulka ne kaha 'no caments'gauratlab he ki eches phulka ne 1984 ke sikh virdohi dangon ke peediton ke liye kanoonee ladaai ladi
 This year, he left the Aam Aadmi Party amid speculation about the possibility of an alliance between Congress and AAP for the Lok Sabha elections

 According to DLF, after a year, there was a slowdown in the global and Vadra then sold his stake to DLF at the same price
 is prakaar dlef ke daawey ke mutabik, isamen na to koi munafa hua or na hi ghaataa
 In 2008, Vadra attracted dlf's attention towards 100 acres of land in Faridabad

 The loan was given, but after the ownership documents were found suspicious, the deal was said to be stopped
 wadra karj waapas kar ek ghatiya saude se batch gaye
 But here the question arises that why DLF made Vadra a partner in their real estate deals? Is it because the status of Vadra as the 'son-in-law of the first family' of the country could have benefited DLF? Or just because Vadra and K
 pi
 Singh (owner of DLF) has family relations? When Economic Times wrote in March 2011 about 'vadra's stealthy entry into the real estate business', Vadra's statement came on him,' i do well with DLF

 They are seasoned businessmen
 ve bevakoof nahin hai
 They do not need me to carry on their business
 ve varshon se apana kaarobaar kar rahe hai
 Activist-turned-politician Arvind Kejriwal, in a press conference held at the Constitution Club in New Delhi on 5 October, revealed the extent to which Vadra's entrepreneurial potential had grown
 unhone kaha ki wadra or dlef ke bich ek-duusare ko phayda pahunchane vaali saajhedaari thi
 According to him, Vadra got loans and property at a very low rate and in return DLF got the grace of the Congress government of Haryana
 lekin dlef or haryana sarkaar donon ne iskaa khandan kiya he
 Despite the denials, DLF shares fell as much as 12 per cent within three days of Kejriwal's disclosure

 wadra ke prabhaav kaa asar hi he ki ab is pratham parivaar kii gatividhiyon ke bare main kisi tarah kii jaankaree na dene kaa niyam bhi khatm ho rahaa he
 On October 6, writer Madhu Kishwar wrote a very angry blog about how he was evasive when he sought information from RTI about Rahul Gandhi's foreign visits
 kejariwal ne yah sunishchit kar diya he ki ab saarvajanik jivan main koi bhi itnaa pavitra nahin he, jis par ungali na uthaai ja sake
 Vadra could hardly have thought that his business practices could be questioned in any 'banana Republic' (he called India as Banana Republic on Facebook in response to criticisms)
 'mango pipul’ (aam aadmi) kaa unke dwaara uphaas udaane par log kaaphi gusse main pratikriya jataane lage or unhen apana fasebuk account band karne par majaboor hona padaa

 Vadra's sister Michelle was killed in a car accident on the delhi-jaipur highway in April 2001
 unki scottish mul kii anglo-indian maa morin ab bhi unke paanchon companiyon main diarector hai
 It is said that Vadra's relationship with his family had soured after his marriage to Priyanka and in January 2002 he had publicly issued a legal notice to separate himself from his father and brother
 kejariwal ke khulaase ke baad is bare main kayaas lagaae jane lage ki wadra kahaan hai, unke austrailia se lekar dubai tak main hone kii baat kahi ja rahi thi
 a close aide of his, Manoj Arora, told India Today on October 9, 'today, he is here in India
 ' aroda ne yah bhi bataaya ki wadra 268, sukhdev vihaar sthit apane offis main hai
 This is the address for all five companies of Vadra
 aroda ne ulte sawaal kiya, 'wadra koi bayaan nahin dene ja rahe
 What is left to say? 'kejriwal is yet to say anything about Vadra's relationship with other corporate companies, but Congressmen are also now beginning to be curious: Is this just the beginning, how bad will it end? "there is nothing new in these revelations," says a Congress MP
 lekin isse sarkaar ke khilaaf bhrashtachar kii dharna or majboot hogi
 India Today broke a silent conspiracy about this by printing a cover story when Vadra sought political space for his wife and himself during the election campaign in Uttar Pradesh

 She does not want Kejriwal to be credited with exposing corruption, especially fearing that Kejriwal himself may target one of its leaders
 congress yah ladaai puri tarah apni naakaamiyon se haar rahi he
 By questioning Kejriwal's attempt to stay in the headlines after every few days by making new disclosures, they are actually just complaining
 kejariwal kaa kahana he ki vah peeche hatane vaale nahin hai
 He said, 'I will have to confirm all this and crosscheck them
 iske baad hi main unhen saarvajanik kar saktaa hum
 After all it is a question of my credibility
 'congress isi vishwasaneeyata ko nasht hote dekhnaa chaahati he
 Congress strategist Ahmed Patel came to know only on October 5 that Kejriwal was preparing to target Vadra
 team kejariwal ne is bare main sanket de diya tha ki ve 'congress se jude kisi aise vyakti ke bare main khulaasa karne ja rahe hai jinke paas koi rajnatik pad nahin he
 Patel talked to Sonia and Rahul
 us din rahul kashmir main the
 Patel, Sonia, Rahul, Priyanka and Rahul's aide Kanishka Singh worked together to form a defense strategy for the party
 yah nirnay liya gaya ki parivaar kaa koi bhi vyakti pratikriya nahin degaa
 Instead, the party will aggressively defend Vadra and claim that it is an indirect attack on Sonia
 iske mutabik, patel ne party ke bachaav ke liye netaaon ke naam tay kiye: salmaan khurshid, sansadeey kaarymantri rajeev shukla or soochna evam prasaaran mantri ambika soni
 He also spoke to Janardan Dwivedi, the party's media cell in-charge
 samasya yah thi ki party ke logon ko khud yah jaankaree nahin thi ki wadra kis had tak kaarobaar main lipt hai or kisi kii yah poochne kii himmat bhi nahin thi
 The defense of the Congress was moving between two types of stance
 pehali pratikriya yah thi ki wadra ek aam aadmi hai, ve netaa nahin hai
 In response, Kejriwal & Co said that Vadra is the son-in-law of India's most powerful leader
 agle din congress ne apana rukh badal liya or daawa kiya ki wadra or unki real estate company ko dlef dwaara die gaye karj ke badale main koi phayda nahin pahunchaaya gaya
 On October 6, the Congress tried to divert the media attention by releasing another type of news
 us din dopaher pradhanmantri karyaalay se jari ek bayaan main is baat kaa joardaar tareeke se khandan kiya gaya ki sonia gandhi ke videshi dauron ke liye sarkaar ne paise kharch kiye hai
 At 4 pm on the same day, Dwivedi suddenly reached the party's daily media briefing to be held at 24 Akbar Road without a scheduled event and began to react to the allegations made by Kejriwal's India Against Corruption on BJP chief Nitin Gadkari
 lekin ek baar jab saadhe paanch baje kejariwal ne press conference kar sonia ke damaad par nishaanaa sadhana shuru kiya to media main bas ek hi hedline bachi thi
 The commentators (especially those opposing the Congress) started unleashing the Gandhi family
 rajyasabha saansad rajeev chandrashekhar ne wadra syndrome ke bare main ek patr main likhaa, 'rajnatik udhyamita jisamen log netaaon se judate hai yaa mukhyat: raajnneeti main shaamil isliye hote hai ki ek nae tarah kaa venture capital taiyaar kiya ja sake
 'it is one step above crony capitalism

 In our country, it is not easy to love openly, nor to marry and enjoy happy life after marriage
 yahaan har jati ke saath sambandhit sarnem hai or ladakiyon ke maamle to or bhi juda hai
 Here girls have to change the surname after marriage
 itnaa hi nahin bacchon kii paidaaish ke baad se hi apane naam ke saath sambandhit jati-birdari or pitrusatta kaa sarnem lekar chalanaa hota he, lekin yahaan ham jis vaakye kaa zikr karne ja rahe hai vah bilkul juda he
 Here the child got the surname from the matriarchy instead of the patriarchy
 yah kahani aam kahaniyon se isliye alag he kyonki puri duniya main amuman aisa dekha jaataa he ki bacchon ko pitrusatta ke sarnem ke saath jeena hota he
 However, the case was reversed here
 mata-pita ne aapasi samaj se bachche ke sarnem main pitrusatta ke bajaay matrusatta ko tarjeeh di
 Questions standing on the birth certificate in the hospital
 
 
 gauratlab he ki is dampati ke bachche ne videshi sarajameen par janm liya
 Because of this, they already knew that the mother Mel was going to give birth to the child
 dampati ne is vajah se bachche kaa naam bhi pehle hi soch liya tha
 He decided to name it Nirvana
 bachche ke janm ke baad jab hospital seberth certificatebanvaane kii baari ai to dampati ne bachche ke naam ke saath maa kaa sarnem aage kiya
 On this, the hospital authority asked them to confirm again
 jab unhone dubaara is baat kii pushti kii to phir unhone uske hisaab se certificate jari kiya
 The wife has already been writing her household surname
 
 
 bhartiya parampara ko gar dekhen to ham pate hai ki yahaan shaadi ke baad ladki kaa sarnem badal jaataa he
 As soon as the girl becomes the wife of a person, she adds the title of the concerned person to her name
 haalanki ladki kaa sarnem khamasera he or unhone apana sarnem nahin tyaagaa
 Also, the surname of the child also has Khamsera surname instead of Khabia (father's surname)
 ab bachche kaadhikarik namanirvana khamasera he
 Meanwhile, they say that they do not mind the surname of the child
 unka baccha unke liye sirf nirvana he
 For worldly needs, he had to put a surname
 saas-sasur ko ore se he puraa sahyog
 
 
 It is rarely seen in our society that the old and old are supporting the new generation on such occasions, but here the matter is completely reversed
 awwal jab bahu ne apana sarnem nahin badla or duja jab bachche ko matrusatta kii ore se sarnem diya gaya
 The grandparents of the child are happy that their grandson is healthy and cheerful and they are helping him in every way possible

 After the first proposal from the Congress in 2004, the second proposal was made by former Prime Minister and BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee to make Comrade Chatterjee a speaker in the Lok Sabha, which was supported by BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani

 The imbalance between quantity and quality has been the defining story of the Indian higher education sector in the last decade

 No Indian university was considered world-class until iit-guwahati's Times Education Survey last year included it in the 50-year-old top 100 universities

 He was tried for 3 days continuously, but he was paralyzed below the neck and he became blind
 wo aise kai baari gir chukaa tha - kuch baar to main hi us par savaar tha iske baavjood wo gir gaya tha
 He was very strong and did not listen to anyone much, but still we were very special
 15 saalon main khub sari yaaden chhod gaya
 Goodbye friend and thank you for teaching us, our bad habits overwhelm us
 View this post on instagramour stubborn old warrior # Crayon had to be released into # horse heaven last night after he reared (stand on his 2 hind legs) up and fell backwards and hit his head on a stone 
 
 we tried for 3 days but there seemed to be no way to get him back up as he was paralysed below the neck and lost his eyesight
 
 he fell backwards like this many times in his life - a few times with a rider(including me) on his back 
 
 a strong willed horse who never really listened to anyone (a very Jat trait) but we loved him nonetheless
 
 he was with us for 15 years and left many a great memories
 
 farewell my friend 🤗thank you for the lesson that we eventually do fall to our vices 🙏 mahare adiyal buddha yoddha crean ko ghodon ke swarg main jane diya gaya
 He got up and fell backwards and hit his head on a stone

 o Panneerselvam became the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu after the death of AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa
 jayalalita ke aswasth rahane ke dauraan pichley kuch dinon se paneerselvam hi antarim mukhyamantri kii bhoomika main the
 Following the instructions of Paneerselvam, Jayalalithaa's picture was kept in the cabinet meeting and necessary decisions were taken
 paneerselvam ne vaada kiya tha ki jayalalita jaise hi swasth hokar lautati hai, wo apni kursi chhod denge
 However, Jayalalithaa is never going to return
 lekin teesri baar siem pad kii shapath lene vaale paneerselvam kii raahen aasaan bhi nahin hai
 Jayalalithaa's death was confirmed at 11:30 am on Monday night and within just two hours, Panneerselvam, who was very close to Amma, was sworn in as the 19th Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu
 haalanki, siem ke shapath grahan ko lekar bhi kai senior netaaon ne sawaal uthaae ki aakhri itani jaldbaaji kya thi
 It was said that this is the first case of easy transfer of power from one CM to another
 jayalalita ke nidhan kii khabar milte hi jo janata shok main dub gai thi, unhen ahsaas bhi nahin ho rahaa tha ki unka mukhyamantri badal chukaa he
 So, by becoming CM, Panneerselvam should be taken as the heir to Jayalalithaa's political legacy
 yah abhi tak saaf nahin ho sakaa he ki jayalalita kaa asli siyaasi vaaris koun he
 Panneerselvam was elected the head of the parliamentary party
 haalanki party mahasachiv kaa pad ab bhi khaali he
 And there are reports that Sasikala, who is very close to Amma, has her eyes on this post
 jayalalita ke nidhan ke baad shashikala kaa kunba bhi rajaji haul main dikhaai diya
 It is being said that if there is a tussle for power, the party may even tear apart
 jayalalita ke haath main jab satta kii kaman thi to party ke bade bade faislon menshashikala kii bhoomikahoti thi
 Sasikala has a hand in posting the top bureaucrats and police officers of the state and these officers are said to be loyal to Sasikala
 kaha jaataa he ki shashikala ko tamilnadu vidhansabha main annadramuk ke 135 vidhayakon main se kareeb 100 vidhayakon kaa samarthan praapt he
 Most of them belong to the Thevar community which has both Panneerselvam and Sasikala
 rajaji haul main shashikala or unke parijan to maujuud the hi, is dauraan parade ke peeche se unke bhai bhi sakriy hai
 It is said that Sasikala's brothers are trying to mobilize most of the party's mlas in their court so that they can get hold of the assembly and the government
 vaise to paneerselvam isse pehle bhi do baar tamilnadu ke mukhyamantri rah chuke hai
 But this time in the post-jayalalitha period, he will have to work harder to prove himself as the true political heir of Amma
 unke saamne party ko ekajute rakhane kii sabase chunauti he
 Because till now the entire party has been revolving around the Eid of only one leader
 wo thim jayalalita
 It is a fact that there is not a single leader in AIADMK who has leadership skills like party founder MG Ramachandran or Jayalalithaa
 75 dinon tak jab jayalalita apollo aspataal main bhartee raheen to sarkaar kaa kaam kareeb kareeb thap hi rahaa
 No major decision was taken or any major announcement was made
 rajya main abhi annadramuk sarkaar ke chaar saal bache hai
 There is also a challenge before the Panneerselvam government to win the hearts of the people on this front
 iske alaava annadramuk 'brands ammaa' ko kitna kaayam rakh paaegaa, nai sarkaar ke saamne yah bhi chunauti he
 Because this brand Amma has played an important role in bringing the party back to the state and reaching power
 abhi tak annadramuk hameshaa se ek supremeo ke tahat kaam karti rahi he or jati va samudaay kendrit sthaneey netaa inke kahe mutabik kaam karte rahe hai
 This will probably not happen after Jayalalithaa leaves
 paneerselvam or shashikala donon hi ek hi samudaay se taalluk rakhte hai or is samudaay kii badi aabaadi dakshini tamilnadu main rahati he
 Some communities and leaders who have been loyal to the AIADMK may now feel neglected
 kai anya upjatiyaan bhi hai jo annadramuk ke binar tale apana siyaasi vajood bachaae rakhana chaahati hongi
 In such a situation, after Jayalalithaa, it will be a big challenge to gain the trust of these communities after Panneerselvam and AIADMK and keep them loyal voters
 inke alaava good gavarnence or bhrashtachar paneerselvam sarkaar ke saamne sabase bade masale honge
 Except loyalty, Panneerselvam does not appear to possess the quality of a shrewd politician
 haalanki wo bhi piem modi kii tarah pehle chaay bechate the lekin narendra modi ke taur par unki jananaayak kii chhavi mushkil he
 During the last 15 years, since he became CM for the first time, in the world of politics, more friends and admirers of Panneerselvam have become enemies than ever
 ye saare dushman ekajute hokar paneerselvam ke liye mushkilen khadi kar sakate hai
 The Income Tax Department has sent a notice to two non-governmental organizations linked to former IPS officer and Team Anna member Kiran Bedi for investigation

 Former Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar has made a big statement on the surgical strike carried out by the Indian Army in pok in September last year
 parrikar ne kaha ki sargical strike kii yojana june 2015 main manipur main sena ke kafile par ugravadi sanghathan enessien dwaara ghaat lagaakar kiye gaye hamale ke baad hi banaai gai thi
 Manohar Parrikar, presently the Chief Minister of Goa and then Defense Minister of the country, told the events related to the surgical strike at an event of industrialists that when he came to know about the incident of June 4, 2015, he felt humiliated
 is ghatana main 18 jawan shahid hue the
 The former defense minister said, preparations for the September 29 (2016) surgical strike on the western border began on 9 June 2015
 hamane isaki yojana 15 maheene pehle hi banaai thi
 Former Defense Minister said that additional soldiers were trained for this
 praathamikta ke aadhaar par upkaran kharide gaye
 He said that the Swathi Vaapan locating radar developed by DRDO was first used in September 2016 to locate the firing units of the Pakistan Army
 haalanki lagbhag teen maheene baad aadhikarik rup se ise sena main shaamil kiya gaya
 He said that 40 firing units of Pakistani Army were demolished with the help of Swathi radar
 tippaniyan Parrikar revealed that i felt humiliated after the deaths in Manipur
 200 logon ke ek chote se aatanki sanghathan dwaara 18 dogra sainikon ko maarna bhartiya sena kaa apmaan tha
 We sat in the afternoon and evening to work on the first surgical strike, which was completed on the morning of 8 June

 He said, it was a very successful attack
 unhone kaha ki kuch khabaron ke vipareet isamen kisi helicopter kaa prayog nahin hua
 He said, i had put helicopters (on standby) only to take them out (in the emergency)
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) purv raksha mantri ne kaha, pashchimi seemaa par 29 sitambar (2016) ke sargical strike ke taiyaari kii shuruyaat 9 june 2015 ko hui thi
 We had planned it 15 months in advance
 purv raksha mantri ne bataaya ki iske liye atirikt sainikon ko prashikshit kiya gaya
 Equipment purchased on priority basis
 unhone bataaya ki diardio dwaara viksit swathi vaipan loketing radar kaa pakistani sena kii firing units kaa pataa lagane main pehali baar sitambar 2016 main prayog kiya gaya
 However, it was officially inducted into the army about three months later

 The comments parrikar ne khulaasa kiya ki manipur main hui mauton ke baad maine apamaanit mahasoos kiya
 The killing of 18 Dogra soldiers by a small terrorist organization of 200 people was an insult to the Indian Army
 hamane dopaher or shaam ko baithkar pehle sargical strike par kaam kiya, jise 8 june kii subah puraa kiya gaya

 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) a new question has arisen
 kya main kisi ahankaar ke kaaran sarvashaktimaan, sarvyaapee tathaa sarvagyani ishwar ke astitv par vishwaas nahin karata hum? mere kuch dost- shaayad aisa kahkar main un par bahut adhikaar nahin jamaa rahaa hum- mere saath apane thode se sampark main is nishkarsh par pahunchane ke liye utsuk hai ki main ishwar ke astitv ko nakaar kar kuch jarurat se zyada aage ja rahaa hum or mere ghamand ne kuch had tak mujhe is avishvaas ke liye uksaaya he
 i do not boast that i am far above human weaknesses
 sirf vishwaas or andh vishwaas khatarnaak he
 It makes the brain foolish and human reactionary
 jo manushya apane ko yathartwaadee hone kaa daawa karata he, use samast pracheen rudhigat vishwaason ko chunauti deni hogi
 The prevailing opinion has to be tested on the basis of logic
 yadi ve tark kaa prahaar na sah sake, to tukade-tukade hokar gir padegaa
 Then to establish the new philosophy, to make them completely dashed, to clear the place and to reconstruct using some things of the old beliefs
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki ek chetan param aatma kaa, jo prakruti kii gati kaa digdarshan evam sanchaalan karata he, koi astitv nahin he
 We believe in nature and the aim of the entire progressive movement is for man to conquer nature for his service
 isko disha dene ke peeche koi chetan shakti nahin he
 This is our philosophy
 ham aastikon se kuch prashn karnaa chaahate hai
 If you believe that there is an omnipotent, omniscient and omniscient God who created the world, then please tell me why he created it? The world full of sufferings and sorrows suffers from the eternal eternal alliances of innumerable sufferings! Not a single person is completely saturated
 kripaya yah na kahen ki yahi uskaa niyam he
 If he is bound by a rule he is not omnipotent
 krupa karke yah bhi na kahen ki yah uskaa manoranjan he
 Nero had just lit a romp
 usne bahut thodi sankhya main logon kii hatya kii thi
 He did very little sorrow for his complete entertainment
 or uskaa itihaas main kya sthaan he? use itihaaskaar kis naam se bulaate hai? sabhi vifaille visheshan us par barasaaye jate hai
 Nero a heartless, merciless, evil
 ek changez khan ne apane anand ke liye kuch hajaar jaane le leen or aaj ham uske naam se ghrinaa karte hai
 Then how do you justify your god? To the eternal Nero, who has been, and still is, giving me unhappiness every day, every hour and every minute
 phir tum kaise uske dushkarmon kaa paksh lene kii sochate ho, jo changez khan se prayek kshan adhik he?tum kab tak us vyakti ko uchit tehraate rahoge, jo hamaare sharir par ghaav karne kaa saahas isaliye karata he ki baad main mulaayam or aaramdaayak malaham lagaayegaa? main poochta hum ki us chetan param aatma ne is vishwa or usamen manushyon kii rachana kyon kii? anand luutane ke liye? tab usamen or nero main kya fark he?tum musalamaanon or isaayiyo! tum to purvajanm main vishwaas nahin karte
 You, like the Hindus, cannot argue that the suffering of innocent people is the result of the deeds of their past lives
 i ask you why that Almighty worked for six days to create the world by word? And every day he Why does everything say? Call him today
 use pichhlaa itihaas dikhaao
 Let him study today's conditions
 ham dekhenge ki kya vah kehane kaa saahas karata he ki sab thik he
 From imprisonment to slums to slums to millions of starving men, from exploited laborers who are patiently watching bloodshed by capitalist vampires patiently and seeing the waste of manpower that anyone sees Even the person, who has little knowledge, will tremble with fear, and instead of distributing more production to the needy people, From giving a better understanding to the palaces of kings whose foundations lie on the bones of human beings - let him see it all and then say everything is fine! Why and from where? This is my question
 tum chup ho
 Okay, then i go ahead
 or tum hinduo, tum kehete ho ki aaj jo ksht bhoga rahe hai, ye purvajanm ke paapi hai or aaj ke utpeedak pichley janmon main sadhu purush the, atah ve satta kaa anand lut rahe hai
 i have to admit that your ancestors were very clever people
 unhone aise siddhanth gadhe, jinamein tark or avishvaas ke sabhi prayaason ko vifal karne kii kaaphi takat he
 According to jurisprudence, punishment can be justified for only three reasons depending on the effect it has on the offender
 ve hai pratikaar, bhay tathaa sudhaar
 Today the theory of retaliation is condemned by all progressive thinkers
 bhaybheet karne ke siddhanth kaa bhi ant vahiin he
 The principle of reform is only necessary and is essential for the progress of humanity
 iskaa dhyey apradhi ko yogya or shantipriy naagarik ke rup main samaaj ko lautaanaa he
 But even if we consider human beings to be criminals, what is the nature of punishment given to them by God? You say that he produces them by making cows, cats, trees, herbs or animals
 tum aise 84 lakh dandon ko ginate ho
 i ask, what is their effect on humans as reformers? How many people have you met who say that they were born as donkeys in a past life due to some sin? not even one? Do not give examples from your Puranas
 mere paas tumhaari puranic kathaon ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 And then do you know that there is the biggest poverty in the world? This is a punishment
 main poochta hum ki dand prakriya kii kahaan tak prashansa karen, jo anivarytah manushya ko or adhik aparaadh karne ko baadhya kare? mere priy doston! ye siddhanth visheshadhikaar yukt logon ke avishkaar hai
 They justify their captured power, capital and highness on the basis of these principles
 main poochta hoon tumhaara sarvashaktishaalee ishwar har vyakti ko kyon nahin us samay roktaa he jab vah koi paap yaa aparaadh kar rahaa hota he? yah to vah bahut aasaani se kar saktaa he
 Why did he not evoke the spirit of liberating India in the minds of the British? Why would he not have filled the benevolent zeal in the hearts of the capitalists to relinquish their right to personal property over the means of production and thus only the entire labor community, But free all human society from capitalist shackles? Where is God? Is he enjoying the sufferings of human race? a Nero, a Genghis, destroy him! Do you ask me how do i explain the origin of this world and the origin of man? Okay let me tell you
 darwin kii jeev kii utpatti padho
 Your second argument could be why a child is born blind or lame? Is it not the result of the work done in his previous birth? Biologists have found a scientific solution to this problem
 sabhi dharm, sampradaay, panth or aisi anya sansthaaen ant main nirdayee or shoshak sansthaaon, vyaktiyon tathaa virgon kii samarthak ho jaati hai
 Every rebellion against the king has always been a sin in every religion
 manushya jab apane pairon par khadaa hone kaa prayaas karata he tathaa yathartwaadee ban jaataa he, tab use shraddha ko ek ore phenk dena chahie or un sabhi kashton, pareshaaniyon kaa purushatv ke saath saamana karnaa chahie, jinamein paristhitiyaan use patake sakati hai
 This is my position today
 yah meraa ahankaar nahin he, mere dost! yah mere sochane kaa tarika he, jisane mujhe naastik banaaya he
 i consider faith in God and daily prayer to be the most selfish and fallen work for man
 hamen dekhnaa he ki main kaise nibhaa paata hum, mere ek dost ne mujhe prarthana karne ko kaha
 When i told him about being an atheist, he said, in your last days you will start believing
 ' maine kaha, nahin, pyaare dost, aisa nahin hoga
 i explain this to myself as degrading and corrupt
 swaarthee kaarnon se main prarthana nahin karuunga
 Readers and friends, is this arrogance? If it is, i accept it
