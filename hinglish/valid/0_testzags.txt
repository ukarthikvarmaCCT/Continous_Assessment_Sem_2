 dharmasutron main varnashram-dharm, vyaktigat aacharan, raja evam praja ke karttavya aadi kaa vidhaan he
 These are available only as a series of Grihyasutras
 shrautasutron ke samaan hi, mana jaataa he ki prayek shakha ke dharmasutra bhi pruthak-pruthak the
 At present, the Dharmasutras of all branches are not available
 is anuplabdhi kaa ek kaaran yah he ki sampoorn pracheen vaanmay aaj hamaare samaksh vidyaman nahin he
 a large part of it faded away
 iskaa doosraa kaaran yah mana jaataa he ki sabhi shakhaon ke pruthak-pruthak dharmasutron kaa sambhavat: pranayan hi nahin kiya gaya, kyonki in shakhaon ke dwaara kisi anya shakha ke dharmasutron ko hi apana liya gaya tha
 Kumaril Bhatt has given a similar indication in the foregoing
 aaryon ke reeti-rivaaj vedadi pracheen shastron par aadhrut the kintu sutrakaal tak aate-aate in reeti-rivaajon, saamaajik sansthaanon tathaa raajnneetik paristhitiyon main paryaapt parivartan evam pragati ho gayi thi at: in sabko niyambaddh karne kii aavashyaktaa anubhav kii gayi
 Problems that arose along with social development were also getting complicated everyday
 inke samaadhaan kaa kaarybhaar anek vaidic shakhaon ne sambhaal liya, jiske parinamswaroop gahan vichaar-vimarsh purvak sutaragranthon kaa sampaadan kiya gaya
 These sutras preserved this long-term intellectual property through sutras, the proof of this is found in the opinion of many ancient masters quoted in these sutras
 yah to vikaas kaa ek kram tha jo tatkaalik paristhiti ke kaaran nirantar ho rahaa tha
 This development did not stop here, but in the scriptures also, timely changes and additions were made, due to which subsequent memories were born
 nayi-nayi samasyaayen phir bhi ubhartee raheen
 Commentaries and commentaries were also written on the memoirs for their solution, through which new interpretations of the ancient words were made
 is prakaar apane se purvavarti aadhaar ko tyaage bina hi nutan siddhanton tathaa niyamon ke samyaanukool pratipaadan kaa maarg prashast kar liya gaya
 As the name itself suggests, the religious activities of a person have been considered in the Dharmasutras, but the religion propounded in the Dharmasutras is the controller of the entire human life considering all the conduct and behavior rather than being dependent on any particular method of worship
 'dharm' shabd kaa prayog vaidic samhitaon tathaa unke parvarti sahitya main prachur maatra main hota ja rahaa he
 It is here that the meaning of the word dharma is not visible in the later literature, which is available in the Vedic codes
 samhitaon main dharm shabd vistrut arth main prayukt he
 In the Atharvaveda, the eleven holding elements of Prithvi have been counted as ‘prithivi Sdharayanti’
 isi prakaar rugveda* main ‘tani dharmani prathamanyasana’ kahkar yahi bhav prakat kiya gaya he
 In this way, this religion does not belong to any particular country and period, but enumerates such elements which hold all the earth or its inhabitants
 ve niyam shaashvat hai tathaa sabhi ke liye aprihaary hai
 Max Müller has also pointed to this form of religion in these words - For the ancient Indians, religion was not first a matter of interest among many subjects, but it was the method of surrender of all
 iske antargat na keval puja or prarthana aati thi apitu vah sab bhi aata tha jise ham darshan, naitikta, kaanoon or shashan kehete hai
 His entire life was religion for him and other things were as if only for the material needs of this life
 samhitaon ke parvarti sahitya main dharm keval varnashram ke aachaar-vichaar tathaa kriyakalapon tak hi simit rah gaya
 This form of religion is available in the Upanishad-era
 chaandogya upanishad* main dharm ke teen skandh ginaae gayi hai
 Among these, Yajna, study and charity are first, ascetic second and Acharyakul has Vasa third wing
 spasht hi inke antargat virgon main rudh hokar parvarti kaal main puujaapaddati ko bhi dharm ne apane main samavisht kar liya
 Despite this, Vedas are considered by all to be the core of religion
 manu ne to is vishay main 'dharm jigyaasmanaanaan pramaann paraman shruti:' tathaa 'vedokhilo dharmamulam' aadi ghoshnaa karke vedon ko hi dharm kaa mul kaha he
 * In the Gautam Dharmasutra, 'vedas Dharmamoolam' in the beginning
 * ‘tadwidan c smritishile’* sutron dwaara yahi baat kahi gayi he
 Both of these sutras are mere versions of the verses of Manusmriti's 'vedasakhilo Dharmamoolam Smritiksha Ch Tadvidam'
 isi prakaar vaasishth dharmasutra* main bhi 'shrutismritivihitho dharm:' kahkar dharm ke vishay main shruti tathaa smriti ko pramaan mana he
 In addition to Shruti and Smriti in the Boudhayan Dharmasutra, Shruti, Smriti and Shishchacharan, as propounded in Manusmriti, are also said to be a sign of religion
 is prakaar dharm ke lakshan main shruti ke saath smriti tathaa shishtacharan ko bhi sammilit kar liya gaya
 In philosophy, the goal of religion was made very broad by calling it the accomplishment of the world-world and in a way the whole human life was controlled by it
 vaisheshik darshan ke ukt lakshan kaa yahi arth he ki samast jivan kaa, jivan ke prayek shwaas evam kshan kaa upyog hi is reeti se kiya jaae ki jisase abhyuday tathaa ni:shreyas kii siddhi ho sake
 It is the welfare of ourselves and others
 dharm maanav kii shaktiyon evam lakshya ko sankuchit nahin karata apitu vah to manushya main aparimit shakti dekhtaa he jiske aadhaar par manushya apane lakshya ko praapt kar saktaa he
 The goal called Siddhi of Abhyudaya and Disarmed is so great that there is nothing outside it
 ise praapt karne kii ni:seem sambhaavnaayen manushya main nihit hai
 In this way, religion considers every aspect of life and gives its own system
 is vyavastha ke pratipadak hi dharmasutra tathaa smritiyaan hai
 The religious leaders tried to control human life by their texts so that it could achieve both of the above goals
 dharmasutrakaron ne maanav jivan se sambandhit prayek samasya par vichaar karke apni vyavastha di he jisase ki maanav jivan vyavasthit rup se chal sake
 That is why they discussed Varnadharma, ashram-dharma, Rajadharma, Prajadharma, Catering, Sin, Atonement, Caste-system, Dayad, Marriage etc
 in every major subjects
 dharmasutron kaa vyakti ke saamaajik jivan kii drushti se atyant mahatv he
 Man is a social animal
 samaaj main rahakar hi use apane aachaar-vyavhaar, naitikta aadi kaa paalan karnaa hota he
 You have to control yourself from the point of view of society
 uchhrun-khalataa-niyam-rahitta yaa aniatikta ke rahete samaaj chal nahin saktaa
 In the Dharmasutras, rules have been made for editing the social life of a person
 un niyamon ke dwaara hi samaaj main vyakti ke karttavya tathaa adhikaron kaa niyantran hota he
 In the Dharmasutras, there is a gradual description of the mutual conduct and behavior of different sections of the society and the duties and rights of the person going through various situations are mentioned
 kabhi-kabhi dharmasutra grihyasutron ke pratipaadya vishyon par bhi vichaar karte prathit hote hai kintu aisa kam sthanon par hi he
 In the Grihyasutras, there is a description of Pakyagya, marriage, rites, shraadh, madhuparka etc
 is prakaar grihyasutron main vyakti ke grihasth jivan ke sanchalanarth aise reeti-rivaaj tathaa niyamon kaa varnan he jo vyakti ke dharmik jivan ko sanyamit tathaa anushaasit karte hai kintu vyakti kaa jivan keval dharm tak hi to simit nahin he
 He also has to live a social life where he has some social problems, he also has social and moral responsibilities, which are punished for not fulfilling or breaking them
 dharmasutron kaa mahatv isi drushti se he ki in saamaajik evam naitik dayitvon tathaa inke purna na karne par vividh prakaar ke dandon kaa vidhaan dharmasutrakaar hi karte hai
 Thus the area of the Dharmasutras extends to the life and problems of the diverse sections and ashrams in the society, while the area of the Grihyasutras is limited to the rules and customs prevailing under its branches
 dharmasutron kaa mahatv unke vishay-pratipaadan ke kaaran he
 The basis of social system is varnashrama-system
 dharmasutron main varnashram-vyavastha ke aadhaar par hi vividh vishyon kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 In this, adequate light has been thrown on the duties and rights of the Varnas
 dharmasutrakaar aaptkaal main bhi man se hi aachaar-paalan par bal dete hai
 Accession from the unworthy and corrupt person has been completely denied
 varnon evam ashramon ke kartavya-nirdhaaran kii drushti se bhi dharmasutra paryaapt mahatv rakhte hai
 By the time of the Dharmasutras, the importance of Ashrams had increased enough, so adequate instructions have been given in Dharmasutras
 sabhi ashramon kaa aadhaar grihasthashram he tathaa uskaa aadhaar he vivaah
 The Dharmasutras throw enough light on marriage
 yahan par yah vishesh he ki ashtavidh vivaahon main sabhi dharmasutrakaron ne na to ek kram ko apanaaya tathaa na hi unki shreshthata ke taratamya ko sabhi ne sweekaar kiya
 Pratolom marriage is condemned everywhere
 vivahoparant pati-patni ke dharmik krity ek saath karne kaa vidhaan he
 Both have been considered equally right on wealth
 grihasth ke liye panch mahayajna tathaa sabhi sanskaron kii anivaaryta yahan par pratipaadit kii gayi he
 The religious leaders were also well aware of the fact that breach of breach in society leads to heterosexuality
 dharmasutrakaron ne varnsankar jatiyon ko bhi manyata pradaan karke unki saamaajik sthiti kaa nirdhaaran kar diya tathaa varnavyavastha kaa paalan karakar varnsankarta ko rokane kaa daayitv raja ko saunp diya gaya
 The doctrine of Jatyutkarsh and Jatyapakarsh has also been proposed in the Gautam Dharmasutra *
 is prakaar varnashram ke vividh kartavyon kaa pratipaadan karke iske saath patak, mahapatak, praayshchitt, bhakshyabhakshya, shraadh, vivaah or unke nirnay, sakshi, nyaayakarta, aparaadh, dand, rin, byaaj, janm-mrityuvishayak ashauch, stri-dharm aadi aise sabhi vishyon par dharmasutron main vichaar kiya gaya he, jinka jivan main upyog he
 The religious leaders have laid great emphasis on the conduct and behavior of a person
 aachaar hi maanav kaa aadhaar he; vahi dharm kaa tatv he, is baat ko dharamshastrakaar bhalee-bhanti jaanate the
 In Manusmriti, the emphasis has been placed on ethics even to the extent that it has been called the 'ultimate religion' and it has been said that even a Vedic person cannot be sanctified
 isi prakaar kaa vichaar vasishtha dharmasutra* main vyakt kiya gaya he
 We should introduce religion in our practice and not just in word
 yadhyapi sadachaar kaa paalan atyant aprihaary he
 Only then the society can remain stable, but at the same time it is also worth remembering that the observance of virtue is a very difficult task
 satat praytn karte rahane par bhi aacharan-bhrashtataa sambhav he tathaa kuch vyakti jaanboojhkar bhi samaaj-virdohi tathaa shaastra-virdohi aacharan kar dete hai
 Irrespective of any reason, such a person is called impure
 dharmasutrakaar is baat ko acchhee prakaar jaanate the
 They also knew that such a person should be punished for misconduct or crime, but if he repents from his sinful act, he should again be given an opportunity to become superior and not for his life forever
 Should be made dark
 isi uddeshy se dharmasutrakaron ne dushtachari ke liye anek prakaar ke dandon evam prayashchiton kaa vidhaan kiya jaataa he jisase vah vyakti shuddh ho sake
 In the eyes of the Dharmasutras, criminals are not an object of hatred, but they are a character of affection and sympathy
 dharmasutrakaron kii manyata ke mul main karm siddhanth hai, jiske anusaar kiya hua koi bhi shubhashubh karm nasht nahin hota, apitu achche-bure kisi na kisi fal ko avashya hi utpann karata he
 The fruits of those actions may be found in this life, whether in the next life, but it will surely be found
 isliye vartmaan tathaa bhavi donon hi janm shuddh ho saken, yahi dharmasutrakaron kaa ytn he
 At the core of ethics is ritualism
 yahi paap ko dur karne kii prerana detaa he
 Along with Varnashrama Dharma, Rajdharma has also been thoroughly discussed in Dharmasutras
 raja main divine ansh kii kalpana kii gayi he
 Dharmasutras also envisage the king's duty, authority and penal system for anti-social elements
 dharm tathaa arth ke virodh kii sthiti main raja ko dharm kaa hi paksh lenaa chahie
 The rules of war for the king are also mentioned in these texts, such as Brahmins, showing backs, sitting on the ground, they are said to be avadhya
 is prakaar dharmasutra rajshastra ke pramukh vishyon tathaa upaadaanon kii saamaanya vivechna prastut karte hai
 Thus, by determining the duties of varnashram in his time, the religious leaders have played an important role in giving proper direction to the society
 saath hi aparaadhon ke liye vividh prakaar ke praayshchit tathaa dand-vidhaan karke samaaj ko aparadhmukt karne kaa bhi ytn kiya
 It was the task of the religious leaders to give recognition to social customs and conduct
 prathit hota he ki us kaal main dharmasutrakaar samaaj ko saamaajik evam naitik drushti se niyantrit evam sanyamit karne main lage hue the
 It was mandatory for a civilized and healthy society
 aaj samaaj main purvaapekshaya anek parivartan ho chuke hai
 As today, the political system and the judicial system have changed
 shiksha kaa swaroop tathaa sansthaayen bhi ve nahin hai, jo prachinyug main thim
 The caste system has taken the place of Varna system
 saamaajik tathaa naitik mulya bhi purvaapekshaya parivartit hue hai
 Today, political law is also acceptable for Dayad and division of property, etc
 aise samay main in dharmasutron kii parimit praasangikta hi maani ja sakati he
 We also get sufficient geographical indications from Dharmasutras like Gautama and Boudhayana, as in Boudhayana Dharmasutra *, the boundary of the country of men is given
 yahi aryaavart he tathaa is pradesh kaa aacharan anyon ke liye pramaan he
 It is also mentioned in Manusmriti
 * main anya aacharyon kaa mat bhi diya gaya he ki ganga tathaa yamuna ke bich kaa pradesh bhi aryaavart he
 In this way, these formulas also have an important place in the form of giving geographical information

 Dharmasutras * also help us to know the history of the origin of castes
 adhiktar dharmasutra yaa to kisi sutaracharan se sambaddh kalp ke bhaag he yaa grihyasutron se sambandh rakhte hai, jabaki dharamshastra kisi bhi sutaracharan se sambandhit nahin hai
 The Dharmashastras are padyamaya, while the Dharmasutras are in prose or prose-verse
 dharmasutron main apni shakha ke veda athwa charan ke prati aadar vishesh rahata he, jabaki dharamshastron main aisa nahin he
 In Dharmasutras, there is no fixed order of subject-deliberation, whereas in the scriptures, the orderly and systematic thinking of all subjects is divided by these three parts and systematic and systematic thinking is available
 maxmooler ke anusaar dharamshastra dharmasutron ke roopaantar maatr hai
 They do not exist independently
 tadnusaar manusmriti maitrayani shakha ke kisi pracheen maanav dharmasutra kaa naveen sanskaran maatr he
 Both Grihyasutra and Dharmasutra are smarts
 kabhi-kabhi dharmasutra apane kalp ke grihyasutron kaa anusaran bhi karte hai tathaa grihyasutron ke hi vishay kaa pratipaadan karte hai
 However their authority and authenticity is independent
 is samay chaar hi dharmasutra aise uplabdh hai jo apane grihyasutron kaa anusaran karte hai
 These are - Boudhayan, Aapastamb, Hiranyakeshi and Vaikhanas Grihyasutras
 anya grihyasutron kaa anusaran karne vaale dharmasutra is samay uplabdh nahin hai
 It is also believed that there was only one person in the Kriyasutra and Dharmasutra of his kalpa
 dow ramgopal ne is vishay main yah vichaar prakat kiya he- 'yah to siddh he ki ek hi kalp ke grihyasutra tathaa dharmasutra kaa kartta kae hi vyakti tha, kintu is vishay main matbhed paaya jaataa he ki ek hi shakha ke sabhi grihyasutron ke anuroop dharmasutron kii bhi rachana kii gayi thi yaa keval kuch shakhaon ke kalpon main hi yah visheshta rakhi gayi thi
 'kundal Lala Sharma also writes about religion, Shrouta and Grihyasutra, considering the same person as the same person -' It should be understood that the principle of Shrauta, householder and Dharmasutra of one era was the same person
 ' yadi inke kartta ek hi vyakti the to ye granth samakalik rahe honge

 To control human life, two types of texts are available in the form of Dharmasutras pioneered by Manusmriti etc
 Theology and Gautamadi
 prashn he ki dharamshastra purvavarti he yaa dharmasutra purvavarti hai? vidwaanon ne donon hi pakshon main apni vyavastha di he
 On the basis of internal evidence, the Dharmashastras can be considered as preceding the Dharmasutras, because the Dharmasutras and their doers have been mentioned many times in the Dharmasutras
 iske liye nimna udhaaharan drashtavy hai jahaan par ki* dharamshastra kaa ullekh hua he-'tasya c vyavhaaro vede dharamshastrakhyangani upaveda: puranam
 'not only that, but in the Gautam Dharmasutra, the name of Manu is also taken
 * dharmasutron main anek sthanon par 'eke'* tathaa 'acharya'* aadi shabdon dwaara anyon ke mat kaa bhi ullekh kiya gaya he
 On this basis, some scholars have concluded that these signs are only towards theology
 kintu ukt kathan anumaan par hi aadhrut he
 The words 'AK' and 'acharya:' can also be remembered by other religious leaders, not just theologians
 at: is hetu ko dharamshastron kii purvakalikta ke rup main upasthit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It is expedient to consider them as preceding the Gautam Dharmasutra after the mention of Manu Dharmashastras in the Gautam Dharmasutra
 kundanlal sharma ne apana aashay in shabdon main vyakt kiya he- sutara-rachana se purv bhi padyatmak rachana thi kintu vah nasht ho gayi
 According to Buehler, these types of verses were part of popular memory verses
 maxmooler ne dharamshastron kii apeksha dharmasutron ko purvavarti mana he
 Maxmüller, while translating Stenschler, has forcefully opined that all verse theology was without exception based on ancient sutras
 dow bhandarkar kaa bhi yahi vichaar he ki dharmasutron kii rachana ke pashchaat hi anushtup chand vaale dharamshastron kii rachana kii gayi
 MMPV Kane does not agree with this
 unke anusaar dharmasutra purvavarti hai tathaa dharamshastra parvarti- 'isi prakaar kuch bahut puraane sutron yatha boudhayan dharmasutra main bhi ek shloke uddhrut hai', isse yah spasht ho jaataa he ki shlokabaddh dharmagranth dharmasutron se bhi purv vidyaman the
 While considering the period of the scriptures of Manusmriti etc
, we also have to keep in mind that Yaskacharya has taken the name of Manu in Nirukta
 at: maananaa hoga ki yask se purv dharamshastra vidyaman the
 The era of Yask is considered to be 800 BC
 manusmrityaadi dharamshastra isse purvavarti hai tathaa dharmasutra yask ke samakaleen yaa isse bhi uttarvarti siddh hote hai
 It is certain that the oldest of the Dharmasutras, the Dharmasutras of Gautama, Boudhayana and Aapastamb are dated between 600 and 300 BCE

 Sri Lanka has about 15,000 monks and nuns in 6,000 Buddhist monasteries
 According to traditional Sri Lankan chronicles such as the Dipavamsa, Buddhism was introduced into Sri Lanka in the third century BCE after the Third Buddhist council by Mahinda Bhikkhu, son of Emperor Ashoka, during the reign of Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura
 During this time, a sapling of the Bodhi Tree was brought to Sri Lanka and the first monasteries and Buddhist monuments were established
 Among these, the Isurumuniya and the Vessagiri remain important centers of worship
 He is also credited with the construction of the Pathamaka cetiya, the Jambukola vihāra and the Hatthālhaka vihāra and the refectory
 The Pali Canon, having previously been preserved as an oral tradition, was first committed to writing in Sri Lanka around 30 BCE
 Mahavamsa §29 records that during the rule of the greco-bactrian King Menander I, a Yona head monk named Mahadharmaraksita led 30,000 Buddhist monks from "the Greek city of Alasandra" north of modern Kabul, Afghanistan) to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the Ruwanwelisaya in Anuradhapura, indicating that greco-buddhism contributed to early Sri Lankan Buddhism
 See also the Milinda Panha
 As a result of the work of Buddhaghosa and other compilers such as Dhammapala, Sri Lanka developed a strong tradition of written textual transmission of the Pali Canon
 The compilation of the Atthakatha along with the Nikāyas and other Pitakas were committed to writing for the first time in the Aluvihare Rock Temple during the first century BCE
 Buddhist literature in Sinhalese also thrived and by 410, Sri Lankan monks traveled widely throughout India and Asia introducing their works
 Over much of the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, three subdivisions of Theravāda existed in Sri Lanka, consisting of the monks of the three mahaviharas, Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya, Abhayagiri vihāra and Jetavanaramaya
 The Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya was the first tradition to be established while Abhayagiri vihāra and Jetavanaramaya were established by monks who had broken away from the Maha Viharaya tradition
 According to AK Warder, the Indian Mahīśāsaka established itself in Sri Lanka alongside the Theravadas, into which they were later absorbed
 Northern regions of Sri Lanka also seem to have been ceded to sects from India at certain times
 In the 7th century, Xuanzang wrote of two major divisions of Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka, referring to the Abhayagiri tradition as the "mahayana Sthaviras," and the Mahāvihāra tradition as the "hinayana Sthaviras
" Abhayagiri appears to have been a center for Mahayana and Vajrayana teachings; Xuanzang writes, "the Mahāvihāravāsins reject the Mahāyāna and practice the Hīnayāna, while the Abhayagirivihāravāsins study both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna teachings and propagate the Tripiṭaka
 In the 8th century, both Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism were being practiced in Sri Lanka, and two Indian monks responsible for propagating Vajrayana Buddhism in China, Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra, visited the island during this time
 In Pali commentaries, terms used for the Mahayanins of Abhayagiri were Vaitulya, Vaipulya and Vaidalya
 According to HR Perera, the Theravada commentaries considered them heretical and their doctrines included: In the 5th century, Faxian visited Sri Lanka and lived there for two years with the monks
 Faxian obtained a Sanskrit copy of the Vinaya of the Mahīśāsaka at the Abhayagiri vihāra c
 406
 The Mahīśāsaka Vinaya was then translated into Chinese in 434 by Buddhajiva and Zhu Daosheng
 This translation of the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya remains extant in the Chinese Buddhist canon as Taishō Tripiṭaka 1421
 The 7th century pilgrim Xuanzang first learned for several years at Nalanda and then intended to go to Sri Lanka to seek out further instruction
 However, after meeting Sri Lankan monks in the Chola capital who were refugees, he decided not to visit: From the 5th century to the eleventh century, the island of Sri Lanka saw continuous warfare between local kings, pretenders and foreign invaders such as the South Indian Chola and Pandyan dynasties
 This warfare saw the sacking of viharas and made the situation for difficult for Buddhism
 In 1070, Vijayabahu i of Polonnaruwa conquered the island and set about repairing the monasteries
 The state of Sri Lankan Buddhism was so bad at this time that he could not find five bhikkhus in the whole island to ordain more monks and restore the monastic tradition; Therefore, he sent an embassy to Burma, which sent back several eminent elders with Buddhist texts
 The king oversaw the ordination of thousands of monks
 The royal reforming of Sri Lankan Buddhism continued under Parakramabahu I, who restored many stupas and monasteries
 During this period, Sri Lankan Buddhist literature thrived once again and the three greats writers Mahākassapa Thera of Dimbulagala Raja Maha Vihara, Moggallana Thera and Sāriputta Thera compiled Pali commentaries and sub-commentaries
 Parakramabahu II of Dambadeniya was a learned king and wrote several Sinhalese Buddhist texts
 Before the 12th century, more rulers of Sri Lanka gave support and patronage to the Abhayagiris, and travelers such as Faxian saw the Abhayagiris as the main Buddhist tradition in Sri Lanka
 The trend of Abhayagiri being the dominant sect changed in the 12th century, when the Maha Viharaya gained the political support of Parakramabahu I, who completely abolished the Abhayagiri and Jetavanaya traditions
 The monks of these two traditions were then defrocked and given the choice of either returning to the laity permanently or attempting reordination under the Maha Viharaya tradition as sāmaṇeras
 Parakkamabāhu also appointed a saṅgharāja "king of the Sangha," a monk who would preside over the Sangha and its ordinations in Sri Lanka with the assistance of two deputies
 Veneration of Avalokiteśvara has continued to the present day in Sri Lanka, where he is called Nātha
 In more recent times, some western-educated Theravādins have attempted to identify Nātha with Maitreya
 However, traditions and basic iconography, including an image of Amitābha on his crown, identify Nātha as Avalokiteśvara
 Early reports by Europeans from the 18th century describe the Buddhist monks of Sri Lanka as being engaged in the recitation of mantras and using Buddhist prayer beads for counting as practiced in Mahayana Buddhism
 Sri Lanka has the longest continuous history of Buddhism of any Buddhist nation, with the Sangha having existed in a largely unbroken lineage since its introduction in the 3rd century BCE
 During periods of decline, the Sri Lankan monastic lineage was revived through contact with Burma and Thailand
 From the 16th century onward, missionaries and Portuguese, Dutch and British colonizers of Sri Lanka have attempted to convert the local population to Christianity
 The wars with the Portuguese and their allies weakened the Sangha
 In 1592, Vimaladharmasuriya i of Kandy sought aid from Burma in order to ordain Buddhist monks on the island as there was hardly a single properly ordained monk left
 From 1612 to 1658, the Dutch and the Portuguese fought over the island with the Sinhalese caught in the middle, the Dutch won and occupied the maritime sections of the island that had been occupied by the Portuguese until 1796 when they surrendered their territories to the British
 The Dutch were less zealous than the Portuguese in their religious proselytizing, though they still discriminated against Buddhists which were not allowed to register with the local authorities therefore many Sinhalese pretended to be Protestant
 During this period many religiously inclined Sinhalese rulers of the interior such as Vira Narendra Sinha of Kandy and Sri Vijaya Rajasinha of Kandy continued to patronize Buddhism, restoring temples and monasteries
 In the mid 18th century the higher ordination of Buddhist monks known as upasampada, which was defunct at the time, was revived with the help of Thai Buddhist monks on the initiatives taken by Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero during the reign of king Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe
 In 1813 the American Ceylon Mission was established in Jaffna
 In 1815 a British army captured Kandy and deposed the Sinhalese king ending a line of Buddhist kings lasting 2301 years, they retained Sri Lanka until 1948
 Like the Dutch, the British refused to register unbaptized infants and to accept non-christian marriages
 They also always preferred Christians in government administration
 The British also supported various Christian missionary groups who established schools on the island
 Education in these schools were a requirement for government office
 Missionaries also wrote tracts in Sinhalese attacking Buddhism and promoting Christianity In the 19th century, a national Buddhist movement began as a response to Christian proselytizing, and was empowered by the results of the Panadura debate between Christian priests and Buddhist monks such as Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera and Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera which was widely seen as a victory for the Buddhists
 In 1880 Henry Steel Olcott arrived in Sri Lanka with Madame Blavatsky of the Theosophical Society; he had been inspired when he read about the Panadura debate and after learning about Buddhism converted to the religion
 Olcott and the Sinhalese Buddhist leaders established the Buddhist Theosophical Society in 1880, with the goal of convicted Buddhist schools
 The society also had its own publications to promote Buddhism; the Sinhalese newspaper, Sarasavisandarasa, and its English counterpart, The Buddhist
 As a result of their efforts, Vesak became a public holiday, Buddhist registrars of marriage were allowed, and interest in Buddhism increased
 Another important figure in the revival is Anagarika Dharmapala, initially an interpreter for Olcott, who traveled around the island preaching and writing
 After traveling to India, he established the Maha Bodhi Society in 1891 whose goal was to revive Buddhism in India, and restore the ancient Buddhist shrines at Bodh Gaya, Sarnath and Kushinara
 His efforts saw the restoration of these sites and a renewal of interest in Buddhism among some Indians
 The associations of the Buddhist revival also contributed much to the publication of Buddhist texts, and promotion of Buddhist scholarship
 Revivalist Buddhist scholars include Sir DB Jayatillake, FR Somnayake, Valisinha Harishchandra and WA de Silva
 Several Buddhist shrines were also rebuilt
 Buddhist leaders were also active in the movement for Sri Lankan independence
 Since independence, Buddhism has continued to thrive on the island
 Since the Buddhist revival Sri Lanka has also been an important center of Western Buddhist scholarship
 One of the first western bhikkhus, Nyanatiloka Mahathera studied in Sri Lanka, established the Island Hermitage there and ordained several western monks
 Western monks who studied in the island hermitage such as Nanamoli Bhikkhu and Ven
 Nyanaponika were responsible for many important translations of the Pali Canon and other texts on Buddhism in English and German
 a few years after the arrival of Mahinda, Bhikkhuni Sanghamitta, who is also believed to be the daughter of Emperor Ashoka, came to Sri Lanka
 She started the first nun's order in Sri Lanka, but this order of nuns died out in Sri Lanka in the 11th century
 Many women have been ordained in Sri Lanka since 1996
 In 1996 through the efforts of Sakyadhita, an International Buddhist Women Association, Theravada bhikkhuni order was revived, when 11 Sri Lankan women received full ordination in Sarnath, India, in a procedure held by Ven
 Dodangoda Revata Mahāthera and the late Ven
 Mapalagama Vipulasāra Mahāthera of the Mahābodhi Society in India with assistance from monks and nuns of Korean Chogyo order
 Some bhikkhuni ordinations were carried out with the assistance of nuns from the East Asian tradition; others were carried out by the Theravada monk's Order alone
 Since 2005, many ordination ceremonies for women have been organized by the head of the Dambulla chapter of the Siyam Nikaya in Sri Lanka
 The different sects of the Sri Lankan Buddhist clergy are referred to as Nikayas, and three main Nikayas are: Within these three main divisions there are numerous other divisions, some of which are caste based
 There are no doctrinal differences among any of them
 Buddhism in Sri Lanka is predominantly practiced by the Sinhalese, however the 2012 Sri Lanka Census revealed a Buddhist population of 22,254, including eleven monks, amongst the Sri Lankan Tamil population, accounting to roughly 1% of all Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka
 In 1988 almost 93% of the Sinhalese speaking population in Sri Lanka were Buddhist

 sookshmjeev vigyaan kii vartmaan sthiti ke bare main thodaa aitihaasik sandarbh main vichaar karnaa upyukt hoga
 This science has created many splendid chapters in its history
 aadhunik sookshmjeev vaigyanik pashchar, coach or unke vidhyaarthiyon kii badaulat is vigyaan ne unnisvin sadi main shandaar dhang se pravesh kiya tha
 From the very beginning, the research and use of microbiological science has impacted health, nutrition and the environment
 is tarah se is vigyaan kaa samaaj par vyapak asar dekha ja saktaa he
 It is worth noting that the microbiological process of major infectious diseases was discovered in the first twenty years of the nineteenth century and as a result efforts were made to rot and cure these diseases
 aaj istemaal ho rahe kai rog-pratirodhi tike shuruuaati sookshmjeev vigyaniyon kii hi dein hai
 Another important point is that early research helped to understand the cycles of substances in nature and this understanding provided a logical basis for food production and preservation
 yah sookshmjeev vigyaan kaa pratham swarna yug tha
 In the first few decades of the twentieth century microbiology was divided into several independent branches
 pashchar ne chikitsakeey va paryaavarniya sookshmjeev vigyaan main ek-se tareekon kaa upyog karke is vishay main ekikaran laane kaa jo prayaas kiya tha uskaa sthaan vishisht vishyon ne le liya
 During this period, microbiological scientists and immune scientists related to medicine were basically doing research work at the level of the organism
 koshish thi kii paraseete or uske mejabaan kii gatividhiyon kaa ekikaran kiya jaae
 On the other hand the focus of environmental microbiological scientists was on chemical processes
 rus ke sarjai vinogradski or holland ke martins bierink or albert kluvar ke shodh kaary kaa parinaam tha ki paryaavarniya sookshmjeev vigyaan dhire-dhire tulanaatmak jaev rasayan kii ek shakha ban gaya
 The emphasis was on the fact that all living organisms have the same biochemical processes
 mote taur par kahen, to is avadhi main sookshmjeev vigyaan puri tarah koshika vigyaan banakar nahin ubhara tha
 The rest of biology had the benefit of a much broader cellular investigation, although the separation of cells and electron microscopes had not yet emerged strongly
 us samay praayogic jeev vigyaan par jaev-rasayan shastriyon or unki utkrisht uplabdhiyon kaa bolbalaa tha khaas tagra se ve mul shariri kriyaaon kaa khulaasa karne main safal rahe the
 But all this did not help towards understanding that bacteria are also cells and they have a complex organization
 jaev rasayan se prerit shodhakarta bacteria ko kan maanate the, jinhen aap ret ke saath pis sakate hai yaa dabaav kam karke phod sakate hai
 Bacteria are the major components of a cell
 bacteria koshika ke pramukh ghatak koshika bhitti, koshika jhilli, jeevadravya or newcliu kaa dhundhala sa chitra bana tha
 Bactabria and their composition were the subject of intense and passionate debate
 kuchhek hi aise sooyeeboojh vaale shodhakarta the jinka kaam aane vaale varshon main tik sakaa us samay is vishay ko bacteria koshika vigyaan kaha jaataa tha
 This topic was called bacterial cytology
 is vishay main kaam kar rahe logon ke alaava shesh log to bacteria or shaayad virus ko bhi thodaa vicitra hi maanate the
 There was no agreement on whether the bacteria are cells or not
 unamem jeens kii upasthiti kii baat to abhi bahut dur thi
 This trend can be gauged from the fact that when Fred Griffith discovered the genetic alteration of bacteria in 1928, there was no excitement about it
 sookshmjeev vigyaan kaa doosraa swarna yug 1940 ke dashak main aanvik genetics ke saath shuru hota he
 The era began in 1943 with the beautiful experiment of Salvador Luria and Max Delbrück
 in vaigyanikon ne bacteria tantra kii madad se vikasvaadi jeev vigyaan ke ek buniyadi sawaal ko sulajhane kaa prayaas kiya tha
 The question was whether mutations occur automatically or under environmental pressure? Dramatically, this experiment demonstrated that bacteria and bacteriostics can be well used to understand some important biology questions 
 iske kuch hi samay baad 1946 main joshua lederbarg ne ba vacteria main sanlayagan kii khoj kii
 This discovery gave biology a new direction
 yadi bacteria samagam kar sakate hai, to ve avashya koshikaayen hona chahie
 These tremendous achievements were followed by many discoveries in the 1960s that opened up new avenues
 in khojon kaa sambandh mul jaivik prakriyaaon se tha
 These include the structure of DNA, the existence and importance of plasmids, the regulation of gene expression and the unfolding of genetic codes
 ab sthiti yah ho gai ki yadi aap jeev vigyaan ke agrim morche par rahanaa chaahate hai, to aapako susakshmajeev modells ke saath kaam karnaa hi hoga
 Around this time antibiotics were in widespread use
 iske baad sookshmjeev vigyaan kii ek pramukh shakha rogaanuon kaa adhyayan nepathy main chali gai
 In fact, some people had announced that infectious diseases are about to end and with this, medical microbiology will be the subject of the past
 alabatta yah ghoshnaa thodi badboli sabit hui he
 However, between 1950 and 1970, microbiology was almost synonymous with molecular biology
 dhire-dhire sookshmjivon se sikhi gai baaten anya jantuon va vanaspatiyon kii koshikaon ke adhyayan main bhi upyogi pai gai
 These could be applied directly, especially in organisms like yeast
 anya jeevon main itani aasaani se chhedchhad nahin kii ja sakati or na hi ve bacteria kii raftaar se sankhya vruddhi karte hain
 In his study, the techniques of DNA cloning and DNA chain determination got even more benefit
 parinaam yah hua ki kai shodhakarta bacteriabhakshiyon ko chhod eukeriotic koshikaon kii ore daude
 The days of microbiological science have turned again
 lag rahaa he ki yah vigyaan tisare swarna yug main pravesh kar rahaa he
 We can see this in the following contexts
 susakshmajeev ichology: kisi samay yah sookshmjeev vigyaan kii ek vishisht shakha thi magar ab kendra main aati ja rahi he polimrej chen riection tathgya chloning takanic kii badaulat ab yah sambhav ho gaya he ki aap model jeevon ke sankeern daayre se mukt hokar lagbhag kisi bhi sookshmjeev kaa adhyayan kar sakate hai
 These include microorganisms that have not been possible to culture in the laboratory
 ek anumaan ke mutabik ye kul sookshmjivon main se 99 prratishat hai
 Now we can answer these types of questions
 koun-sa jeev kahaan rahata hai, kya karata he orginetic rup se kisase sambandhit he
 As a result, the known microorganism world has become very vast
 orchia jaise puure nae samooh saamne aae hai
 Microorganisms can be found at unexpected places
 jaise samudri garm sote or chattaanon kii gahari daraaron main
 These are microorganisms that do not depend on the energy and oxygen of the sun
 inhone sookshmjeev ichology ke daayre ko bahut vistrut bana diya he or prakruti main padaarthon ke chakron main sookshmjivon kii bhoomika kii hamaari samaj ko badhaayaa he
 There is also an increasing understanding that microorganisms in nature live in groups: some with their greens, some with other species
 iske chalate sookshmjivon kaa adhyayan prayogshaala se nikalakar unke prakritvaas kii ore bad rahaa he
 Some researchers have discovered genes that are expressed only when microorganisms are in their host's body
 is ichological nazariye ke chalate kai naveen kriyavidhiyaan pahachaani ja rahi hai
 Bio-evolution: Originally the result of the size is that the genome chain of a number of nucleus prior to eukaryote organisms has been exposed
 yah koi achraj kii baat nahin he
 That a large industry has come into existence to make a profit from this rich store of information
 jinom sambandhi jaankaree kaa upyog jaev vikaas kaa maarg talashne main bhi hua he
 a surprising finding in this context has been that the transfer of genes from one organism to another is quite widespread and its effects are also quite wide
 asambandhit prajatiyon main jinom dwap najar aate hai jo unhen nae-nae kriyaatmak gunon se las kar dete hai
 In bacteria, genes are exchanged between mutually unrelated species
 is tarah ke parshviya jin sthanantaran kii vyapaktaa ke chalate hamen yah sochane par vivash hona padaa he ki kya jaev vikaas kii baat shuddhat: alag-alag shakhaon ke rup main kii ja sakati hai
 In fact it is happening that transactions are happening between different branches of the tree
 yani kisi jeev ke purvaj maatr ek raskheey kram main nahin dhunde ja sakate vibhinn rekhaon ke bich antarkirya ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana hoga
 There are also indications that this transaction also occurs between eukaryotic-prokaryotic
 prasangvash, yah gauratlab he ki is sabake kaaran sookshmjivon kii duniya main prajati kii avadharana gadda-madda ho jaati he

 sharia main bahut se vishyon par mat he, jaise ki swasthya, khanpan, puja vidhi, vrath vidhi, vivaah, jurm, raajnneeti, arthvyavastha ityadi
 Muslims believe that Sharia is the law of the divine, but there is a lot of difference in how this law should be defined and enforced
 sunni samudaay main chaar bhinn fiqh ke nazariye hai or shiya samudaay main do
 Sharia is understood differently in different countries, communities and cultures

 It has eight chapters; Each chapter has four legs; Each foot has 38 to 220 sutras
 is prakaar ashtaadhi main aath adhyay, battis paad or sab milakar lagbhag 3155 sutara hai
 Mahamuni Katyayan has a detailed treatise on Ashtadhyayi and Lord Patanjali's detailed narrative text on sutras and discourses is the great sage
 sankshep main sutara, vaarthik evam mahabhashya teenon sammilit rup main 'panineey vyakaran' kehalaata he or sutarakaar panini, vaarthikkaar katyayan evam bhashyakaar patanjali - teenon vyakaran ke 'trimuni' kehalaate hai
 Ashtadhyayi is considered the chief among the six Vedangas
 ashtaadhi main 3155 sutara or aarambh main varnsamamnay ke 14 pratyaahaar sutara hai
 The magnitude of Ashtadhyayi is equal to one thousand Anushtupa Shlokas
 mahabhashya main ashtaadhi ko "sarvaveda-parishad-shaastra" kaha gaya he
 That is, Ashtadhyayi was not confined to any Vedic special and was related to all Vedic codes and Panini was respectful of all provident opinions
 ashtaadhi main anek purvaacharyon ke maton or sutron kaa sannivesh kiya gaya
 Among them, Shaktayana, Shakalya, Abhishali, Gargya, Galav, Bharadwaja, Kashyapa, Shaunak, Sphotayan, Chakravarmana are mentioned by Panini
 ashtaadhi ke karta panini kab hue, is vishay main kai mat hai
 Bhandarkar and Goldstalker date back to the 7th century BC
 Believe it
 mcdanel, kith aadi kitne hi vidwaanon ne inhen chauthi shatabdi i

 According to Indian tradition, Panini was a contemporary of Nandas and this time was in the 5th century BC
 Should be panini main shatmaan, vinshatik or karshapan aadi jin mudraon kaa ek saath ullekh he unke aadhaar par evam anya kai kaarnon se hamen panini kaa kaal yahi samichin jaan padataa he
 Ashtadhyayi has eight chapters and each chapter has four chapters
 pehle duusare adhyyon main sangya or paribhaasha sambandhi sutara hai evam vaakya main aae hue kriya or sangya shabdon ke parsparik sambandh ke niamak prakaran bhi hai, jaise kriya ke liye aatmanepad-parasmapad-prakaran, evam sangyaaon ke liye vibhakti, samaas aadi
 The third, fourth and fifth chapters contain all types of suffixes
 tisare adhyay main dhaatuon main pratyay lagaakar kridant shabdon kaa nirvachan he or chauthe tathaa paanchave adhyyon main sangya shabdon main pratyay jodakar bane nae sangya shabdon kaa vistrut nirvachan bataaya gaya he
 The semantics that these suffixes reveal are called vritti in the definition of grammar, like Indradhanu occurring in the rain will be called the annual Indradhanu
 varsha main honevaale is vishesh arth ko prakat karanevaala "ek" pratyay taddhit pratyay he
 There are 1,190 sutras in the episode and 631 in the Kridanta episode
 is prakaar kridant, taddhit pratyayon ke vidhaan ke liye ashtaadhi ke 1,821 arthath aadhe se kuch hi kam sutara viniyukt hue hai
 The sixth, seventh and eighth chapters refer to the changes that occur in the letters of the word
 ye parivartan yaa to mul shabd main judanevaale pratyayon ke kaaran yaa sandhi ke kaaran hote hai
 The legislative sutras of dualism, propagation, pact, tone, agam, omission, long etc
 have come in the sixth chapter
 chathe adhyay ke chauthe paad se saatven adhyay ke ant tak angadhikaar naamak ek vishisht prakaran he jisamen un parivartanon kaa varnan he jo pratyay ke kaaran mul shabdon main yaa mul shabd ke kaaran pratyay main hote hai
 These changes are also seen in the form of legislation of long, low, loss, advance, order, quality, growth, etc
 ashtum adhyay main, vaakyagat shabdon ke dwitvavidhan, plutavidhan evam shatv or natvavidhan kaa visheshat: upadesh he
 In addition to Ashtadhyayi, two episodes related to the same, namely Ganapath and Dhatipatha, were also definitely made of Panini
 unki parampara aaj tak akshunn chali aati he, yadhyapi ganpaath main kuch nae shabd bhi puraani soochiyon main kaalaantar main jod die gaye hai
 The present Unadi Sutras are suspected to be panoramic and cannot be considered as an integral part of Ashtadhyayi's text
 vartmaan unadi sutara shakatayan-vyakaran ke gyaat haate hai
 Panini aimed to refine and regularize the present form of Sanskrit language by incorporating the various components and components of the language such as phonology, name, verse, verb, sentence, gender etc
 and their interrelations in the 32 verses of the Ashtadhyayi, which comprise eight chapters
 i am equally divided
 vyakaran ke is mahneey granth main panini ne vibhakti-pradhan sanskrit bhashaa ke vishaal kalevar kaa samgr evam sampoorn vivechan lagbhag 4000 sutron main kiya he, jo aath adhyyon main sankhya kii drushti se asmaan rup se vibhajit hai
 Keeping in mind the misbehavior of writing material in the society then, Panini has taken the help of sutra style to make the grammar memorable
 punah, vivechan ko atishay sankshipt banane hetu panini ne apane purvavarti vaiyakarnon se praapt upkarnon ke saath-saath swayan bhi anek upkarnon kaa prayog kiya he jiname shivasutra yaa maheshwar sutara sabase mahatvapurn hai
 It is famous that Maharishi Panini received these sutras from Devadhidev Shiva
 panini ne sanskrit bhashaa ke sabhi shabdon ke nirvachan ke liye kareeb 4000 sutron kii rachana kii jo ashtaadhi ke aath adhyyon main vaigyanik dhang se sangruhit hai
 These formulas are exactly like the mathematics formulas
 jis tarah se jatil evam vistrut ganitiya dharanaon athwa siddhanton ko sutron dwaara saralata se vyakt kiya jaataa he, usee tarah panini ne sutron dwaara atyant sankshep main hi vyakaran ke jatil niyamon ko spasht kar diya he
 He had to compose 4000 sutras to discuss all aspects of the language
 panini ne ashtaadhi main prakarnon tathaa tadsambandhit sutron kaa vibhaajan vaigyanik reeti se kiya he
 Panini has divided Ashtadhyayi into two parts: Sapadasaptadhyayi from the first chapter to the first foot of the eighth chapter and the remaining three feet are called Tripadi
 panini ne purvatrasiddham sutara banaakar nirdesh diya he ki sapadasptadhyaayi main vivechit niyamon kii tulana main tripadi main varnit niyam asiddh hai
 That is, if there is conflict between the rules mentioned in both the parts, then the rule of the former part will be valid
 isi tarah, sapadasptadhyaayi ke antargat aane vaale sutron main bhi virodh drushtigochar hone par krmanusaar parvarti sutara kaa praadhanya rahegaa – vipratishedhe paran kaaryam
 After establishing these principles, Panini firstly defined noun terms and later discussed topics based on those noun terms
 sankshiptata banaae rakhane ke liye panini ne anek upaay kiye hai
 Most important in this is the construction of distinct nouns
 vyakaran ke niyamon ko bataane main bhashaa ke jin shabdon / aksharon samoohon kii baarambaar aavashyaktaa padati thi, unhen panini ne ekatra kar vibhinn vishisht naam de diya jo sangyaaon ke rup main ashtaadhi main aavashyaktaanusaar vibhinn prasangon main prayukt kiye gaye hai
 Panini defines similar nouns before stating the rules, such as - Maheshwar Sutra - 'pratyahara, it, ti, nadi, ghu, verse, metal, suffix, organ, allegiance, etc
 inamen se kuch ko panini ne apane purvavarti vaiyakarnon se udhaar liya he
 But most have been made by them themselves
 in sangyaaon kaa vivaran aage diya gaya he
 In considering some elements of grammar, such as metal, suffixes, prefixes, Panini required many rules
 aise niyamon ke nirmaan ke pehle, prarambh main hi panini un sambandhit avyavon kaa ullekh kar bataa dete hai ki aage ek nishchit sutara tak in avyavon kaa adhikaar rahegaa
 They have already defined these elements as nouns
 duusare shabdon main panini prakaran vishesh kaa nirvachan us prakaran kii moolbhoot sangya – yatha dhaatu, pratyay ityadi – ke adhikaar main karte hai jisase unhe prayek sutara main sambandhit sangya ko baar–baar duhraana nahin padataa he
