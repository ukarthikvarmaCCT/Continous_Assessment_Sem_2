 Solukhumbu district buddha apane maarg main stri ko diksha nahin dena chaahate the | bahut aagrah par hi diksha de paye | diksha dene se pehle atirikt aath niyamon kaa praavdhaan kiya tab jaakar diksha di | jisamen se kuch is prakaar he:- 
 Even if the nun has attained the subcontinent for a hundred years and even if the bhikkhu has attained the sampasada on the same day, the monk itself will have to welcome him, he will have to obey, worship, do not encroach this religious life throughout his life
 
 bhikshuni ko kisi bhi sthiti main bhikshu ko gaali nahin deni hogi | is gharm niyam ko jivan-bhar atikaraman na kar iskaa satkar karnaa hoga, use maananaa hoga, poojana hoga | Buddha has to know both men and women separately
 They have found these two to be physically and mentally different on the outer and inner floor
 They have found different, but they have not said very low
 The Buddha also made the system different because of their differences
 Buddha's sense of equality towards all human beings is somewhat deep
 From above, it would seem that Buddha is not in favor of equality towards women
 But it is not so
 vastut: buddha kaa maarg gyaan margi he, sankalp margi he, bhaktimargi nahin he | purush va stri ke chetana ke kendra bhi bhinn he | purush mulat: man kendrit he | uskaa sara jor baudghik he | vah har cheez ko tark vitark ke aghar par hi tolta he | tark karne main bhav kii gunjaaish nahin rah paati | tarkwaan vyakti hi sankalp aasaani se kar paata he | isaliye tarkwaan vyakti kathor bhi hota he | yahi vyakti buddha ke maarg ke anukool he | purushon main bahut kam log hi strain-chitt vaale milegein | or striyon main bahut kam log hi purush chitra vaale milegein | duusari taraf stri kii chetana kaa tal bhaavana pradhan he | prem kii maatra, bhav kii maatra stri main pragadh hoti he | samarpan usamen sahaj hota he | hosh ko khone main, swayan ke prati besudh hone main use aasaani lagati he | yahi stri ke aayam buddha ke maarg ke pratikul padate hai | buddha kaa maarg to hosh va sankalp kaa maarg he | In this situation, if Buddha gives initiation to women as soon as possible, most women will be deprived of benefits
 What happens to a woman's energy when women are unable to climb the path of Dhamma? This was a question that had to be solved
 When a woman's energy does not flow on the path of Gham, then her energy flows on the worldly path
 Because the woman is emotional, she can weave only the fabric of the raga
 It was easy for men to fall into this raga as lust
 Then Buddha had to make such an arrangement, so that men also do not fall in lust and women leave the raga and go on the path of determination
 purush va stri ke vaasana ke tal bhi bhinn bhinn hai | purush kii vaasana kaa rup jahaan shaareerik rup se bahirmukhi or kriyasheel he, vahiin stri kii vaasana kaa rup sharirik rup se gaiyr kriyasheel va antarmukhi he | isaliye buddha ne stri par bharosa karnaa uchit samajha, bajaay purush ke | yah badi chakit karne vaali baat he | yah baat bhala kaise samajhaaii ja sakati he ? buddha kaa manushya ke prati gyaan adbhut he | is vyavastha ke hisaab se yahaan buddha ne stri par bharosa kar ke purash se zyada stri ko sammaan diya he | buddha ne purush kii vasanagat kamajori ko bhi sweekaar kar liya he | Now understand how? There is a tradition in our country
 a family should have two brothers
 The elder brother is only a year old
 The elder brother is married
 After marriage, the younger brother's wife has come to the same house
 What does the first family get done when the younger daughter-in-law arrives? They also introduce the daughter-in-law of the daughter-in-law while introducing her mother-in-law
 The daughter-in-law of the daughter-in-law is only one year older than her husband, yet the mother-in-law touches the father-in-law's feet as well as the feet of the elder brother
 This seems a bit strange and impractical
 After all, what is the need of it? The people of this country have realized the weakness of the man from inside
 Lust towards the younger brother's wife can be awakened anytime in this elder brother's mind
 So that nothing untoward happens in the family, it should be stopped as far as possible mentally and emotionally
 purush, purush-chitt hone ke kaaran ahamkaari hota he, jise vah swabhimaan kahata he | is swabhimaan ko bachaane kii vah jitod koshish karata he | jab ek stri purush ke charnon main chhuk kar use devtaa kaa sa darja de detii he | tab purush main apana sammaan banaaye rakhane kaa sankalp paidaa ho jaataa he | yah stri bhi ab purush kii najar main saadhaaran stri naa rahi | yah bhi ab is purush kii najar main upar uth gai he | purush saamanyat: us stri ko hi vaasana kii najar se dekhtaa he, jo uski najar main hey ho | hey hona va vaasana main girnaa donon ek saath ghatit hote hai | purush ke sabase pehle vaasana main girane ke asaar adhik hote hai | isaliye buddha ne stri par zyada bharosa kiya he, or vinay ke niyam bhi usee par zyada banaaye hai | Now it has become easier to understand Buddha's attitude towards the woman
 That is why Buddha has made the rule that even though the elder is a elder, the monk will first greet the junior monk
 Second, Buddha has made the rule that under no circumstances will the monk abuse the monk
 Looks strange
 Just like Buddha has given the male monk complete freedom to abuse and insult the female monk
 When a monk abuses a male monk, it is more likely that the nun may fall from the monk's eyes and start looking at him with a look of lust
 Men can fall quickly into lust
 a man can also rape, It is more likely
 Hardly any woman thinks of raping a man
 We are able to know by analyzing how much trust and respect Buddha has given to a woman
 It is not so easy to understand Buddha's teachings
 Great endurance and a calm state of mind is needed before concluding
 Without meditating, neither one can understand "ghamma" nor can he understand Buddha
 stri tab tak “charitraheen” nahin ho sakati, jab tak purush “charitraheen” na ho ~ gautam buddha! After retiring, Gautama Buddha traveled to many areas
 ek baar vah ek gaanv main gaye
 There a woman came to him and said - aap to koi rajkumaar lagate hai
 May i know what is the reason for wearing ocher cloth in this youth? buddha ne vinamratapurvak uttar diya ki - He retired to find solutions to three questions
 buddha ne kaha - This body of ours which is young and attractive, but soon it will grow old, then ill and finally go to the mouth of death
 mujhe ‘vriddhavastha’, ‘beemaari’ va ‘mrityu' ke kaaran kaa gyaan praapt karnaa he
 Impressed by the thoughts of Buddha, the woman invited him for a meal
 sheeghra hi yah baat puure gaanv main fail gai
 The villagers came to Buddha and requested that they should not go to the house of this woman for food
 kyonki vah "charitraheen" he! Buddha asked the head of the village - kya aap bhi maanate hai ki vah stri charitraheen he? The chief said that i take an oath that she is a woman of bad character
 aap uske ghar na jaaen
 The Buddha grabbed the right hand of the chief and asked him to clap - mukhiya ne kaha - main ek haath se tali nahin baja saktaa kyonki You have held my other hand
 buddha bole - isi prakaar yah stri swayan charitraheen kaise ho sakati he? Unless the men of this village are characterless! agar gaanv ke sabhi purush achche hote to yah aurat aisi na hoti
 Therefore, the men here are responsible for its character

 kamboj pracheen bharat ke 16 mahajanapadon main se ek tha
 It is also mentioned in Panini's Ashtadhyayi as one of the 15 powerful districts
 buddha granth angutar nikaay, mahavastu me 16 mahajanapadon main bhi kamboj kaa kai baar ullekh hua he - ye gandharon ke sameepvarti the
 There must have been a close relationship among them, because in many places the names of Gandhara and Kamboj come together

 Rajpur, Dwarka and Kapishi were their major cities
 iskaa ullekh irani pracheen lekhon main bhi miltaa he jisamen ise raja kambijes ke pradesh se joda jaataa he
 In this quote, Kalidas has described the walnut trees in the country of Kamboj, which is very expedient
 isse bhi is desh kii sthiti kashmir ke aas paas prathit hoti hai
 Kamboj was an ancient Indian district located near Gandhara in Uttarapath, whose exact location can be considered under the tail region of the southwest
 pracheen sanskrit evam paali sahitya main kamboj or gandhar kaa naam praaia: saath-saath aata he
 Just as the description of the excellent wool of Gandhara is found in the Rig Veda, similarly the kambos' blankets are mentioned in the Nirukta of Yask
 vastav main yask ne 'kamboj' shabd kii vyutpatti hi 'sundar kambalon kaa upbhog karanevaale' yaa vikalp main sundar bhojan karanevaale log-is prakaar kii he
 Gandhara and Kamboj have proved their association with the tradition of the integral relationship between these two districts
 gandhar afghanistan kaa sanwarti pradesh tha or isi ke pados main purv kii ore kamboj kii sthiti thi
 In Valmiki Ramayana, Kamboj is described with the Vayahika and Vanayu districts and the city of Ayodhya is filled with the best black horses originated in these countries
 mahabharat main arjuna kii digvijay ke prasang main paramkamboj kaa loh or rushik janapadon ke saath ullekh he 
 In Dronaparva by Satyaki, defeating the iniquitous army of kambojas, yavanas, shakas, kirats and barbaris etc
 and pictorial mention of their shaved masts and long beards - o Rajan, Satyaki slaughtered your army with thousands of kamboos, shakas, shabars, kirats and The river of flesh and blood was shed there by reciting the battlefield from the bodies of the barbarians

 yah drashtavy he ki kambojadi ko akruti sambandhi jin visheshtaon kaa varnanmahabharat ke is prasang main hai ve aaj bhi is pradesh ke nivaasiyon main vidyaman hai
 The Mahabharata also mentions a city called Rajpur of Kambojas which was won by Karna

 Thus, we almost certainly get to know the location of the country
 rice davids ne is pradesh kii purvabuddhakalin dwarka naamak nagari kaa ullekh kiya he
 There is also a mention of Nandinagar in another place of Kamboj district in the records of the Ludders, whose position is not well known
 prasiddh vaiyaakaran panini ne, jo swayan kamboj ke sahavarti pradesh ke nivasee the 'kambojalluk' sutara se is janapad ke bare main apni jaankaree prakat kii he
 Patanjali also mentions Kamboj in the Mahabhashya
 sikandar ke akraman ke samay kamboj pradesh kii seemaa ke antargat ursha or abhisar naamak chote-chote rajya based hue the
 In the Pali Granth Angusadnikaya, kambhoj is also enumerated among the 16 Mahajanapadas of India
 ashok ke abhilekhon main kambojon kaa ullekh, simavarti yawanon, nabhakon, nabhapanktiyon, bhojpitinakon or gandharon aadi ke saath kiya gaya he 
 It is known from this script that though Ashoka had a borderline border line of Kambhoj, yet his rule was also prevalent there
 vidwaanon kaa mat he ki shahbajgadhi or mansehara main praapt abhilekhon se, ashok ke samay main, kramash: gandhar or kamboj janapadon kii sthiti kaa gyaan hota he
 In the description of Mahabharata, there is an idea of the non-aryan customs of the country of Kamboj
 bhishma
 9,65 main kambojon ko mlechjaateey bataaya gaya he
 Manu has also named Kambojas as Dasyu and described him as a fluent language
 manu kii hi bhanti niruktkaar yask ne bhi kambojon kii boli ko arya bhashaa se bhinn kaha he or is tathy ke pramaan main unhone udhaaharan bhi diya he 
 Similarly, the Bhuridatta Jataka also mentions the non-religious and non-aryan religion of the Kambojas
 chini yatri yuvanachwang ne bhi raajpur ke sanwarti pradesh ke nivaasiyon ko bharat ke aryajanon kii saanskrithik parampara ke bahirgat mana he or unhen uttar-pashchim kii simavarti asabhy jatiyon ke antargat bataaya he
 Yuvanchwang has written Rajpur as 'holoshipulo' in Chinese
 kintu iske saath yah baat bhi dhyaan dene yogya he ki kamboj main bahut pracheen kaal se hi aaryon kii bastiyaan bidyman thim
 This is clearly indicated by the mention of Vanshbrahman in which there is a reference to the Acharya named Kamboj Aupamanyava
 yah acharya upamanyu gotra main utpann, madragaar ke shashya or kamboj desh ke nivasee the
 Keith speculates that the names of Aupamanyava Kamboj and his mentor Madagara mentioned in this passage give an idea of the imminent relationship between the north and north Kamboj countries
 pali granth majjhimanikaay se bhi kamboj main arya samskruti kii vidyamanata ke bare main soochna milti he
 In the Mahabharata, the names of kings named Kamat and Sudakshin of Kambose country are found

 In Sanskrit poetic texts, there are many references about Kamboj; Kalidasa, for example, has a beautiful description of his victory over the Kambojas in the context of Raghu's Digvijaya Yatra in Raghuvansh - 'the kamboj-dwellers unable to bear Raghu's influence are the nut trees of their country, from which Raghu's army maddens The chains of elephants were tied, and had to be pleaded like
 ' yah drashtavy he ki kalidas ke samay main bhi aaj hi kii tarah bharat ke is pradesh ke akhrot prasiddh the
 According to historian Kalhan, the King Naresh Lalitaditya had won the Kamboj along with many other countries of Uttarapath
 uske varnan main bhi kamboj kii parampara se prasiddh ghodon kaa ullekh 
 This description also proves that the name of the country of Kambhoj was prevalent till the medieval period of Indian history and its boundaries were also generally the same, but it seems that after the gradual merger of this district into the state of Kashmir
 After this, its separate power came to an end and along with it its name also fell into the trough of oblivion
 phir bhi abhi tak kamboj ke naam kii smriti kafiristaan ke nikatavarti pradesh ke kuch kabeelon ke naamon, jaise kamboji, chamoj or kamozey aadi main surakshit he
 Tibet has been designated in the Nepali tradition under the name of Kamboj country, but from the above facts it is well proved that the position of this district must have been close to the northern western border of ancient India

 audichya brahman ke rup main mul itihaas varsh 950 i
 ke aasapaas se paaya jaataa he
 It is known that in the year 942 AD, Moolraj Solanki captured the throne of Anilpur Patan by killing his maternal uncle and the then king Samanta Singh Chavda
 un dinon sattarudh raja kii hatya or pujari kii hatya jaise aparaadhon ko akshamya aparaadh mana jaataa tha jisaki sajaa aatmadah thi or jiskaa parimarjan keval shrimali brahmanon ke dwaara hi sambhav hota tha
 However, when Mulraj became notorious as the culprit for the murder of Raja Samant Singh, the beloved of the Shrimalis, the Shrimali Brahmins strictly refused to scrape this heinous crime and declare Mulraj as the king
 arse se chaawda raajaaon ke saath jude rahe gujarat ke ye yaajak brahman shrimaal bhinnmal, jo ki rajasthan ke dakshini bhaag main sthit, se aaye the
 Shrimali Brahmin was the state's state priest
 unke kaaryon main, dharm or nyaay shaamil tha
 He refused to bless Moolraj and proclaimed him as the king
 kisi bhi tarah se unhen samajhane, dhan, dhamkee aadi kaa un brahmanon par koi prabhaav nahin padaa
 Then as an undeclared king, Moolraj resolved to perform 'rudra Yajna' as a penance and build a huge Rudra temple
 phir bhi shrimali brahman pujarigan nahin maane
 The Srimali Brahmins, who were adamant on the self-immolation of Moolraj, were then told about the future destruction and anarchy of the state of Gujarat, but this too had no effect on them
 usee samay kai chaawda vanshajon kaa singhaasana ke liye daawey bhi aane shuru ho gaye the
 Enemies on the state's border intensified their enthusiasts to conquer Gujarat
 agar rajya ko banaae rakhana tha to nishchay hi mulraj or shrimalion ke bich sulah kii atyadhik zarurat thi lekin shrimali yaajak paristhitiyon ko samajhane ke baad bhi mulraj ko hatya ke dand se mukt karne ke pakshdhar nahin hue
 Ultimately, Moolraj's friends and members of the cabinet secretly decided to bring scholarly Brahmins from different parts of the country and give them what they had been getting till now
 turant is kaam ko karne ke liye mantri madhav ke netritv main kai dalon ko ganga or yamuna nadiyon ke maidaanon main sthit vibhinn mahatvapurn va brahman bahul ilaakon main bheja gaya or vahaan ke vidwaan brahmanon ko lubhaavne sthaayee pravaas va anupam rajkeey prashray va vyavastha kaa lobh dekar gujarat aane ke liye raji karavaaya gaya
 To avoid any future conspiracy, it was also ensured that all Brahmins were brought from different places
 mulraj or unke mantri madhav ne is babat apane purakhon kii bhoomi kanyakubj se bulaae gaye brahmanon ko praathamikta di taaki anya sahit purv ke shrimali brahmanon ke varchasv kii kami ho sake
 Thus Moolraj could be a Vaidya king himself and would continue to hold on to the newcomer Brahmin families
 is prakaar yojananusaar 1037 brahman pariwaron kaa ek bada kaaravaan siddhpur patan pahunchaa
 Till now, the undeclared King Moolraj got the convenience of more than the promised promises and made him his forever
 paramparaagat rup se brahmanon ko apane pravaas yaa mul ke sthaan ke dwaara janaa jaataa tha
 Hence, this large group of Brahmins, coming from the north and consisting of various gotras of the past, was officially named Sahastra Audichya Brahmin
 sanskrit main, audichya kaa arth uttari disha se he
 Thus gotra origin remained unchanged and the location provided by King Moolraj Solanki, Sri Sthal, which later became known as Siddhpur Patan, became his permanent place
 is prakaar gotrake naam or sankhya, pariwaron ke unke mul sthaan par basane ke anusaar hui

 Out of 1037 families, 37 families, considering the truth of the Shrimali Brahmins, decided not to participate in the king's plan

 He moved away with a group after informing his decision to Moolraj, he was known as Tolakia Audichya Brahmin

 The two practice guidelines say: adhikansh, lekin sabhi vyaktigat adhyayan nahin, lipej kii shreshthata kaa samarthan karte hai
 In a large study, there were no patients with pancreatitis who had an increased amylase along with normal lipase

 What appears to be the present Amer fort is built on the remnants of the old fort under the rule of King Mansingh, the Kachwaha of Amer
 maansingh ke banawaaye mahal kaa acha vistaar unke vanshaj jai singh pratham dwaara kiya gaya
 In the next 150 years, a lot of reforms and expansion were done in the Amber fort by the Kachhwaha Rajput kings and finally in 1727 during the reign of Sawai Jai Singh II, they shifted their capital to Navarchit Jaipur city
 itihaaskaar james tod ke anusaar is kshetra ko pehle khogong naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Then there was the rule of Meena king Ralun Singh, also known as Alan Singh Chanda
 vah bahut hi nek evam acha raja tha
 He adopted a helpless and homeless Rajput mother and her son, seeking asylum
 kaalaantar main meena raja ne us bachche dhola raay ko bada hone par meena rajavaade ke pratinidhi swaroop dilli bheja
 People of Meena dynasty always used to be armed with weapons, so attacking and defeating them was not easy

 The present Amer palace was built in the 16th century, which was an extension of the already built palace for the residence of its rulers
 yahaan kaa purana prasaad, jise kadimi mahal kaha jaataa he bharat ke pracheenatam vidyaman mehalon main se ek he

 That is why the history of Amer is indelibly linked to these rulers, because they established their empire here
 meenaon ke samay ke madhyakaal ke bahut se nirmaan yaa to dhwans kar diye gaye yaa unke sthaan par aaj koi anya nirmaan kiya hua he
 However, the 16th century Amer fort and the palace complex that was built by the Rajput Maharajas is well preserved

 To the right of Jalebi Chowk is a small but grand temple dedicated to the Kuldevi Shila Mata of the Kachhwaha Rajputs

 The main entrance of the temple has a pair of silver letter-studded doors

 mahabharat main krishna ke mamaa mathura ke raja kansa ne krishna ke pehle 7 bhai bahanon ko isi shila par maaraa tha
 In lieu of this rock, Raja Man Singh returned the territory of Jessore to the defeated King of Bengal
 tab is shila par durga ke mahisasuramardini rup ko uker kar amer ke is mandir main sthapit kiya tha
 Since then, Shila Devi was worshiped as the ancient goddess in the Kachhwaha Rajputs of Amer, although Jamwa Mata of Ramgarh, already being worshiped as Kuldevi in her family, remained Kuldevi

 si ek saamaanya upyog main aane vaali computer kii programmen bhashaa he
 It was developed by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratory in 1972 with the aim of building a Unix operating system
 is samay 'si' pehali yaa duusari sarvaadhik lokapriy programing bhashaa he
 This language is used extensively on various software platforms
 shaayad hi koi computer-platform ho jiske liye si kaa compiler uplabdh na ho
 The deep impact of c language can be seen on many programming languages like c ++, Java, c # etc
 san 1960 main cambridge vishvavidhyalay ne ek computer programing bhashaa kaa vikaas kiya jise unhone BASIC COMBINED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE naam diya
 It was called b in the language of common language
 ’bi’ bhashaa ko san 1972 main bell prayogshaala main computer vaigyanik danish richi dwaara sanshodhit kiya gaya
 The 'C' programming language is a modified form of the 'B' programming language
 ’si’ ko unics oparating system or dos oparating system dono main prayog kiya ja saktaa he, antar maatr compiler kaa hota he
 Unix operating system is the operating system written in 'C'
 yah visheshat: ’si’ ko prayog karne ke liye hi banaaya gaya he at: adhiktar ’si’ kaa prayog unics oparating system par hi kiya gaya he
 The C-language is available as a number of sub-languages with minor differences
 america rashtriya maanak santhaan dwaara viksit ANSI c ko adhiktar maanak mana jaataa he
 The most important feature of this programming language is that it has all the properties of a high level programming language, as well as all the properties of a low level language

 The speed of the programs designed in this programming language is relatively fast
 yah 0 se 15000 tak ginaney main lagbhag ek second kaa samay lagaati he jabaki basic main is kaary main lagbhag 50 second lagate he
 In 'C' programming language many functions are defined for use in the program, but an additional feature is that the programmer can also define new functions as per his requirement
 isame maatr 32 kii shabdon kaa prayog hota he iske saath hi isame anek anya sahaayak program bhi hote he jisaki sahaayta se jatil functions bhi safaltaapurvak kiye ja sakate he
 It mainly deals with mathematics, science and systems related work
 is bhashaa main nirdesh dete samay lower case letters kaa hi prayog kiya jaataa he
 Due to the above features, 'C' is a very popular computer programming language
 isse pehle ham yah jaan chuke hai koi bhi char sanganak kii memory main kis tarah se sangrakshit hota he
 Where this variable is preserved it also has a fixed address that tells where the value of the variable is preserved in memory
 is pate ko hi pointer kehete hai
 The c / c ++ programming language also has the feature that the address of a variable can be determined
 c / C++ programmen bhashaa main bhi char kaa pataa jaanane ke liye & kaa upyog karte hai
 For example, if there is an integer variable x, the address of x will match with & x
 jis prakaar purnank, akshar, vaastavik sankhya ityadi ko char main sangrakshit kiya jaataa hai usee tarah kisi char ke pattey ko bhi
 For this, a new datatype is used to preserve the address in the same way that int datatype is used to preserve integers
 kisi purnank char kaa pataa sangrakshit karne ke liye int* datatype kaa upyog karte hai
 Similarly, characters use char * datatype to preserve the address of a variable
 neeche ek chota sa udhaaharan yah diya gaya he jisamen ek char main duusare char kaa pataa sangrakshit karte hai
 Here first an integer variable x is defined, then p is defined a variable that preserves the address of an integer
 phir p char main x kaa pataa daal diya he
 Address → 0 1 2 3 4 Memory → 1 xxrep 4 0 111 11100101 00100110 xxrep 4 0 101 01100101
 
 
 ↑ p = & x = 3 int x Now the variable is an integer pointer p in which the address of variable x is preserved, that is, the address of x will be written when p is written
 yadi hamen yah jaananaa he ki p main jis memory kaa pataa likhaa hua us memory par kya sangrakshit he to *p kaa upyog karte hai karne ke liye hame ek main function avashya likhnaa hota he
 Because 'C' compiler starts executing any program from main function
 ek sanchika athwa ek program main ek se adhik main function nahin ho sakate
 It is an user defined function
 main function ko ’{’ koshthak dwaara aarambh kiya jaataa he
 At the time of execution of the program file '{' indicates that the execution has to start from here
 isi prakaar ’}’ yah bataata he ki nishpaadan yahan samaapt hona he
 In a program, the main function remains the same, but other functions can be used
 prayek function ke liye { or }ke madhya upaprogram diya jaataa he

 According to another definition, they are called babies until the child or girl is eight years old
 shishuon kaa ronaa ek swaabhaavik kriya he, jo unke liye sanchaar kaa buniyadi saadhan he
 An infant tries to express many feelings like crying, hunger, restlessness, boredom or loneliness
 stanpan kii sifarish sabhi pramukh shishu swasthya sanghathan karte hai
 If breastfeeding is not possible due to any reason, then the baby can be fed with bottle milk, for which the mother's milk or canned infant formula can be given
 shishu chusane kii ek swaabhaavik pravriti ke saath janm lete he or iske dwaara wo stnegar se yaa bottle ke nipple se doodh chuusate hai
 At times, the milk is stored to feed infants, but nowadays it is rare, especially in developed countries

 Others adapt their normal diet to their child's dietary needs
 jab tak shishu swayan shauchalay jane ke liye prashikshit hote he, wo langot, potda yaa dyper pahante hai
 Children sleep more than adults but as they age, their sleepiness declines

 By the time children learn to walk, they are raised in the lap
 iske atirikt unhen bachchagaadee yaa praam me bhi baitha kar yaa lita kar ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par le jaaya jaataa he
 In most developed countries, by law, babies in motor vehicles can only be seated in a safety seat made specifically for them
 dharmraj yudhisthir saat akshuhinee sena ke swami hokar kauravon ke saath yuddh karne ko taiyaar hue
 First Lord Krishna went to Duryodhana, the supreme anger, as the messenger
 unhone gyaarah akshuhinee sena ke swami raja duryodhana se kaha- 'rajan! You give half the kingdom to Yudhishthira or offer him only five villages; Otherwise, fight with them
 ' Listening to Shri Krishna, Duryodhana said- 'I will not even give them land equal to the tip of a needle; Yes, i will definitely fight with them
 ' Having said this, he was determined to take Lord Krishna captive
 us samay rajsabha main bhagwaan shrikrishna ne apane param durdharsh vishwaroop kaa darshan karakar duryodhana ko bhaybheet kar diya
 Vidur then went to his house to worship and greet the Lord

 The commander of the Pandavas was Shikhandi
 in donon main baari yuddh chhid gaya
 The warriors of Bhishmashit Kaurava side started attacking the Pandava-side soldiers in that war and the brave Kaurava-soldiers of Pandava-side like Shikhandi started targeting their arrows
 kaurav or pandav-sena kaa vah yuddh, devasur-sangram ke samaan jaan padataa tha
 The war seemed very pleasing to the gods who stood and watched in the sky
 bhishma ne das dinon tak yuddh karke pandavon kii adhikansh sena ko apane baanon se maar giraaya
 On the tenth day, Arjuna placed a heavy rain of arrows on Veevara Bhishma

 Elephants, horsemen, chariots and pedestrians on both sides were killed by each other's arrows
 bhishma kii mrityu unki ichha ke adheen thi
 When the Pandavas understood that they could not win this war while being Bhishma, then on the suggestion of Shri Krishna, he asked Bhishma Pitamah for his death
 He said that as long as i have an weapon in my hand, no one can beat me except Mahadev
 It was he who suggested to the Pandavas that in front of Shikhandi, they fought the war
 He knew that Shikhandi was Amba in her previous birth, so he considered her as a girl
 10ve din ke yuddh main arjuna ne shikhandi ko aage apane rath par bithaaya
 shikhandi ko aage dekh kar bhishma ne apana dhanush tyaag diya
 After abandoning his weapon, Arjun put him to sleep on the bed of the arrow

 But as soon as Abhimanyu entered the Chakravyuh, the Indus King - Jayadratha blocked the entrance and did not allow other Pandavas to enter
 tab shatruchakra main abhimanyu akelaa pad gaya
 Despite being alone, he fought bravely and single-handedly defeated the great warriors of the Kaurava army, including Karna, Drona and Duryodhana themselves
 karn or duryodhana ne guru dron ke nirdeshaanusaar abhimanyu kaa vadh karne kaa nirnay liya

 kathboliyaan aksar preyokti ke rup main bhi istemaal hoti hai jab kisi chiz ke liye maanak shabd sunne main apriy yaa apmanjanak samajha jaae, masalan 'mutr' ko kai hindibhashi kathboli main 'susu' kehete hai
 Sometimes it is difficult to tell if a word is part or slang of the standard language
 bhashavaigyanik bethani dumaas or jonethan liter ne kisi shabd yaa vaakyansh ke kathboli hone ke kuch chihnon kii suchi banaai ki agar koi shabd inamen se kam-se-kam do lakshan rakhata ho to shaayad kathboli he : Slang is different from a specialist dialect spoken in a commercial field

 jabaki kuch shabd antat kathboli ke rup main apni sthiti ko kho dete hai, anya shabdon ke prayog ko zyaadaatar vaktaaon dwaara isi tarah mana jaataa rahaa
 When slang goes beyond the group or subculture that originally used it, its actual users tend to use other, less-recognized terms to retain the identity of the group
 kathboli kaa ek upyog saamaajik nishedhon ko darkinar karnaa he kyonki mukhyadhara kii bhashaa kuch vaastaviktaaon ko tarotaaja karne se dur bhaagane kii koshish karti he
 For this reason, slang terminology is particularly rich in certain areas such as violence, crime, drugs, and sex

 For example, among the gifts of Californian wine, Cabernet Sauvignon is often referred to as "cab saw", cardone as "card" and so on; This means that naming individual alcohols reduces its unnecessary use; It also helps to show the user's familiarity with alcohol

 Thus both 'cool' and 'hot' can mean "very good," "impressive," or "beautiful"
 kathboli ke shabdon ko aksar keval ek gut yaa antah samooh ke andar istemaal ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Leats for example were originally popular only among certain Internet subcultures such as crackers and online video gamers

 aam bolchaal kii bhashaa kaa prayog anaupchaarik boli main istemaal kii jane vaali ek shabdic saamagree he jabaki vyapak arthon main "bolchaal kii bhashaa" shabdaawalee main kathboli kaa prayog shaamil ho saktaa he, iske sankeern arthon main nahin
 Slang is often used in colloquial language but not all colloquial languages are slang
 kathboli or bolchaal kii bhashaa ke bich karne kaa ek tarika yah poochna he ki kya zyaadaatar sthaneey vaktaa is shabd ko samajhate hai ; agar ve aisa karte hai to yah ek bolchaal kii bhashaa he
 The problem, however, is that it is not a separate, quantization system but a continuum system
 haalanki zyaadaatar kathboliyaan alpakaalik hoti hai or aksar nae logon dwaara prayog kii jaati hai jinamein se kuch gaiyr-kathboli vaali bolchaal kii bhashaa kii sthiti hasil kar leti hai 'anand, bhagya' or ek yahudee mahila kaa pehla naam, zelda) or yahan tak ki ek aupchaarik sthiti "

 uske baad raaj puri koshish karata he ki uski beti kaa pravesh 'prakruti' main ho jaye, lekin uski tamaam koshishon ke baavjood uski beti kaa pravesh nahin ho paata he
 After that, Raj comes home exhausted and continues to rest, when an employee arrives distributing sweets and says that his daughter has entered 'nature'

 Both of them do not believe that a low earning low educated person can get his daughter to enter 'nature' school
 usase poochne se wo bataata he ki uski beti kaa pravesh 'shiksha kaa adhikaar' vaale cote se hua he
 Raj also makes his daughter enter the same quota in 'prakriti'

 wo utana hi apane aap ko doshi maan rahaa tha kyonki uski beti piya ko pravesh mil gaya jabaki shyaam ke bete, mohan ko nahin mila
 Raj feels that Mohan should have got Piya's entry
 usee samay use apni galati kaa ehsaas hota he or wo shyaam jis vidhyalay main padhate rahata he, vahaan ja kar paryaapt raashi daan kar detaa he, jisase vahaan nae pustak aa saken
 Shyam continues to meet the person who has donated money to that school
 lekin jab use sachai kaa pataa chalata he to wo bolta he ki mujhe daan nahin apana adhikaar chahie
