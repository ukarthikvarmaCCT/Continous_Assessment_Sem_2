 Everyone wishes for meaning to attain happiness
 isliye acharya kautilya trivarg main arth ko pradhan maanate hue ise dharm or kaam kaa mul kaha he
 Land, money, animals, friends, education, art and agriculture all fall under the category of meaning
 inaki sankhya nishchit karnaa sambhav nahin he kyonki yah maanav jivan kii aavashyaktaaon par nirbhar karti he
 Man is naturally the desire, it would not be wrong to say that he is Kamnamay
 in sabhi kaamanaayon kii purti kaa ek maatr saadhan arth he

 tab om ko samaj aata he ki subut kii baat bataane vaali sandy nahin, asli shantipriya kii aatma thi, jisane apane hatyare se badla le liya
 The soul of peace, seeing Om with compassion, smiles and disappears

 With small amounts of silicon and rapid cooling, the carbon in white cast iron, precipitated from the molten material via solid cementite in the phase of metallic stabilization metastable, fe3c, precipitated out, instead of as graphite
 Composite substances that melt as relatively large particles are precipitated, usually, in another eutectic mixture, where there is another phase
 These eutectic carbides are so large that they can be reached by providing stiffness to precipitation

 This science originated from land-related tasks, hence this mathematics is also called Bhumiti
 armbh main yah adhyayan rekhaon tathaa rekhaon se ghire kshetron ke gunon tak hi simit rahaa, jiske kaaran jyamiti kaa naam rekhganit bhi he The construction of Yajnavedis in India attracted the attention of mathematicians to the study of geometry, their study was more akin to field committee

 About 600 years before Christ, the Roman mathematician Pithgauras studied this relationship in a logical manner and stated that the square on the hypotenuse in a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares above the other arms
 vaise to jyamiti kaa adhyayan sabhi puraane sabhy deshon, jaise misr, babilonia, china, bharat tathaa yunaan, main lagbhag saath hi saath aarambh hua, parantu jitani unnati is vigyaan main yunaan ne kii utani kisi or desh ne nahin kii
 About 300 years before Christ, Euclid, a mathematician from Greece, sorted all the facts that were known by that time in a very logical manner
 gyaat tathyon ke aadhaar par usne anya tathy siddh karne kaa praytn kiya
 In this way, on sorting the facts, he reached some preliminary facts which are difficult to prove
 vaise ve bilkul spasht prathit hote hai
 These facts are so simple that Euclid accepted them as axiomatic and called them facts themselves
 inhen tathyon par jyamiti ke pramayon kaa pramaan nirbhar he
 Those facts are the following: 1
 ve vastuen, jo ek hi vastu ke baraabar hon, aapas main bhi baraabar hoti hai
 2
 If equal items are added to equal items then the sum is equal
 3
 yadi baraabar vastuon main se baraabar vastuen gata di jaayan to sheshfal baraabar hote hai
 4

 According to Euclid, the plane is one in which the length is the width, but the thickness is not
 bahut se log is paribhaasha par bhi andeh karne lage hai, parantu thodaa manan karne se yah spasht ho jayega ki paribhaasha thik he
 For example, if two liquids are filled in a glass vessel that do not meet each other, then when they become stable, we will see that one plane separates the two substances
 usamen motaai nahin he
 If it were, there would be a space between the two fluids that neither contained the substance below nor the top, but it is impossible
 is udhaaharan se spasht ho gaya hoga ki tal main motaai nahin hoti
 It only has length and width
 isi prakaar dhoop main kisi samtal diwaar kii chaaya dekhakar ham kah sakate hai ki rekha main chaudaai nahin hoti
 The line is located in the plane, so the thickness of the floor is the thickness of the line
 isaliye rekha main na motaai hoti he na chaudaai, keval lambaai hi hoti he
 If the lines meet at a point, then the width of the line is the length of the point, that is, there is neither length, nor width, thickness in the point
 keval sthaan hi hota he
 Everyone will be aware that in geometry, the properties of triangles, squares, circles, cones, cylinders, etc
, are studied
 un prashnon ke halon ne bahut vichaarvardhan kiya, isamen koi shankaa nahin, jaise aisa ghan bananaa jiskaa ghanfal die ghan kaa duguna ho
 At that time, the meaning of composition was understood to be composed only with the help of tracks and compasses

 The third question was to divide a given angle into three equal parts
 yah kaam patari or parkaar se asambhav he, parantu anya upayon se ho saktaa he
 These questions kept mathematicians busy for centuries

 The Greeks also studied the properties of the ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola curve formed by cutting a cone from a plane
 in adhyayanon ne capalan ko apane niyam gyaat karne main badi sahaayta di hogi
 Until the 15th century, geometry was often the study of measurement properties, but after that, properties were also studied which do not depend on measurement; For example, if the vertices of two triangles are on a three pointed line, the corresponding sides meet on a line

 The properties that do not change are studied by interpolation into a simple polygon
 ye gun mul bahubhuj ke liye bhi thik honge
 Also, many conversions are similar to a conversion experiment

 ye rekhaayen bindu ke nirdeshaank kehalaati hai
 With the help of these coordinates each geometric fact can be represented by an algebraic equation
 is jyamiti kaa kai dishaao main vikaas hua
 In the first case, a broader form of geometry emerged, such that the equation of an exponent represents a simple line
 isi prakaar do ghaat kaa sameekaran ek shankav pradarshit karata he
 Similarly, the equations of powers three, four and higher began to be studied and the properties of their corresponding curves became much simpler than before
 tal ke vakron tak hi nahin, avkaash ke vakron kaa bhi adhyayan sambhav ho gaya
 For this, the points of a point from a three-point plane are determined by its distance and represent each point along an equation in Y, R, L
 in samikarnon ke vivechan se talon ore vakron ke gunon kaa adhyayan saralata se hota he
 In the other direction, the solution of composition related questions and activities became very simple
 ye kriyaayein keval kuch samikarnon ke hal par hi nirbhar hai, jisamen bahut vyapak prashn saralata se hal ho jate hai; jaise yadi rekha kisi vakr = o ko katati he, to in donon samikarnon ke hal unke kataan binduon kaa sthaan nishchit karenge
 If the origin of these equations is real, the line cuts the curve
 yadi baraabar hai to rekha vakr ko sparsh karti he
 If imaginary, the line does not intersect the curve, but we can say that the line will always cut the curve at two points, whether the points are real or coincident, or imaginary
 isi prakaar se tathy bade vyapak rup main die ja sakate hai, jo saadhaaran jyamiti main sambhav nahin tha
 In the third direction, coordinate geometry broadened the dimension
 do sankhyaayein ya, r do vimitiyon main tathaa teen sankhyaayein teen vimitiyon main kisi bindu kaa sthaan nishchit karti hai
 Now, the question arose in front of mathematicians as to what the four numbers Y, R, L, and the five numbers Y, R, L, V, would represent
 ganitagyon ne to amoort rup se apane mastishk main badi aasaani se soch liya ki chaar sankhyaayein chaar vimitiyon main or paanch sankhyaayein paanch vimitiyon main kisi bindu kaa sthaan nishchit karengi
 In this way, he also thought well of the anomalies
 unhen isse koi matlab nahin ki parthiv jagat main uskaa koi udhaaharan he yaa nahin
 Einstein must have used this idea in his theory of relativity and clarified the idea of aversion
 ab is ucch vimiti ke vichaar kaa aprayukt ganit main kuch kathin samasyaon ko hal karne main upyog karte hai
 For example, the number of different particles in a moving fluid is represented by seven numbers
 ve hai k, kha, ga, uskaa praarambhik sthaan, tathaa teen veg, jo ya, r, l aksh ke samaantar hon, tathaa samay, yah saat vimiti kaa prashn samajhakar hal ho saktaa he
 In the fourth direction, coordinate geometry generalized numbers and imaginary numbers emerged
 kalpanik bindu tathaa kaalpanik vakr ityadi vichaaron ne jyamiti ko bahut mahatvashaalee bana diya, jisase vyapkikaran main or adhik sahaayta mili, jaise anant par do kaalpanik binduon se janevaala shaankab vrutt hota he, ityadi
 In addition, geometry was discussed with the help of different types of coordinates, such as quadratic coordinates, triangular coordinates, tangent coordinates, etc
 nirdeshaankon ke prayog ke lagbhag 50 varsh baad hi kalan kaa prayog bhi jyamiti main hone laga
 This experiment generated new ideologies in geometry
