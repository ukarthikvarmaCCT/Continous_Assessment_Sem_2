 Parbrahma is infinite, eternal and devoid of body
 wo sabhi gunon se bhi pare he, par usamen anant satya, anant chit or anant anand he
 Brahma is not worshiped, because it is beyond worship and indescribable
 uskaa dhyaan kiya jaataa he
 Pranava is the 8 Brahmavakya, which all Hindus consider to be the ultimate holy word
 hindu yah maanate hai ki om kii dhwani puure brahmand main gunj rahi he
 It is heard when deep into meditation
 brahm kii pariklpana veydant darshan kaa kendriya stambh he or hindu dharm kii vishwa ko anupam dein he
 What is the relation between Brahma and God, the thinking of Hindu philosophy is different
 advait veydant ke anusaar jab maanav brahm ko apane man se jaanane kii koshish karata he, tab brahm ishwar ho jaataa he, kyonki maanav maaya naam kii ek jaadui shakti ke vash main rahata he
 That is, when the shadow of Brahma falls in the mirror of Maya, then the image of Brahma is shown to us as God
 ishwar apni isi jaadui shakti "maaya" se vishwa kii sristi karata he or us par shashan karata he
 Although God is with a negative force in this situation, Maya is not able to impress him, just as a magician is not surprised by his own magic
 maaya ishwar kii daasi he, parantu ham jeevon kii swamini he
 Although God is formless, but because of Maya, he can appear to us as many gods
 iske vipareet vaishnav maton or darshanon main mana jaataa he ki ishwar or brahm main koi fark nahin he--or vishnu hi ishwar hai
 According to the Nyaya, Vaishika and Yoga philosophies, God is the supreme and supreme soul, who is enlightened and is the creator and ruler of the world
 jo bhi ho, baaki baaten sabhi hindu maanate hai : ishwar ek or keval ek he
 It is both universal and reliable
 beshak, ishwar sagun he
 He is self-centered and the cause of the world
 wo puja or upasna kaa vishay he
 He is complete, eternal, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent
 wo raag-dwesh se pare he, par apane bhakton se prem karata he or unpar krupa karata he
 Without his will, not even a single leaf can move in this world
 wo vishwa kii naitik vyavastha ko kaayam rakhata he or jeevon ko unke karmon ke anusaar sukh-dukh pradaan karata he
 According to Srimad Bhagavadgita, he comes from time to time in the form of an avatar on the earth after a moral collapse in the world
 ishwar ke anya naam hai : parameshwar, paramatma, vidhaataa, bhagwaan 
 This god is called Musalman Allah, God, Christian God and Jews Yahweh
 hindu dharm main kai devtaa hai, jinako angrezi main galat rup se "gods" kaha jaataa he
 There can be three opinions about who these deities are: ek baat or kahi ja sakati he ki zyaadaatar vaishnav or shaiva darshan pehle do vichaaron ko sammilit rup se maanate hai
 For example, Krishna is considered to be the God under whom all other gods and goddesses are present and at the same time, all the gods and goddesses are considered to be the form of Krishna
 tisare mat ko dharmagranth manyata nahin dete
 Whatever be the thinking, these deities are integral to the colorful Hindu culture
 vaidic kaal ke mukhya dev the-- indra, agni, som, varun, rudra, vishnu, prajapati, savita or deviyaan-- saraswati, usha, prithvi, ityadi 
 Later Hinduism saw new goddesses - Ganesh, Rama, Krishna, Hanuman, Kartikeya, surya-chandra and planets and goddesses like - Durga, Parvati, Lakshmi, Sheetla, Sita, Kali, etc
 ye sabhi devtaa puraanon main ullikhit hai or unki kul sankhya 33 koti bataayi jaati he

 in sabake alaava hindu dharm main gaay ko bhi mata ke rup main puja jaataa he
 It is believed that the cow has a total of 33 Koti Devi gods
 hindu dharm manyataon main paanch pramukh devtaa poojaneey he
 These are different forms and powers of one God

 According to mythological beliefs, he was the son of Maharishi Angira
 bhagwaan shiv ke kathin tap se unhone devguru kaa pad paaya
 He protected the gods with his knowledge and mantra powers
 shiv krupa se ye guru grah ke rup main bhi poojaneey hai
 Thursday is the special day of worship of Guru Brihaspati Dev
 daanvon ke guru shukracharya maane jate hai
 His father was Maharishi Bhrigu, son of Brahmadev
 shukracharya ne hi shiv kii kathor tapasya kar mrit sanjivani vidya praapt kii, jisase vah mrit sharir main phir se praan phoonk dete the
 By the grace of Brahmadev, he is revered as the planet Venus
 shuukravaar shukr dev kii upasna kaa hi vishesh din he
 According to Hinduism, every conscious creature has an immaterial soul, which is eternal, latent, irrational and devoid of disorder
 hindu dharm ke mutabik manushya main hi nahin, balki har pashu or ped-paudhe, yani ki har jeev main aatma hoti he
 In the Bhagavad Gita, the characteristics of the soul are described by Lord Krishna as follows: kisi bhi janm main apni azaadi se kiye gayi karmon ke mutabik aatma aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 In the cycle of birth and death, the soul occupies itself as the next body without being insulted
 achche karmfal ke prabhaav se manushya kuleen ghar athwa yoni main janm le saktaa he jabaki bure karm karne par nikrusht yoni main janm lenaa padataa he
 The worldly cycle of birth and death ends only when the person gets salvation
 uske baad aatma apane vaastavik sat-chit-anand swabhaav ko sadaa ke liye paa leti he
 The human vagina is the only birth in which a person's deeds, sins and virtuous give fruit, and the attainment of salvation through action is possible
 aatma or punarjanm ke prati yahi dharanaayen buddha dharm or sikh dharm kaa bhi aadhaar he
 The sacred texts of Hinduism are divided into two parts - Shruti and Smriti
 shruti hindu dharm ke sarvocch granth hai, jo purnat: aparivartaneey hai, arthath kisi bhi yug main iname koi badlaav nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Memory texts may change according to country
 shruti ke antargat veda : rugveda, samaveda, yajurveda or atharvaveda brahm sutara va upanishad aate hai
 The Vedas are called Shruti because Hindus believe that these Vedas were recited by the divine to the sages when they were in deep meditation
 vedon ko shravan parampara ke anusaar guru dwaara shishyon ko diya jaataa tha
 Every Veda has four parts - Samhita - Mantra part, Brahmana - Granth - prose part, in which rituals are explained, Aranyak - in which other deep things are explained, Upanishads - In this, Brahma, Atma and their relation are discussed
 is
 agar shruti or smriti main koi vivaad hota he to shruti hi maanya hogi
 Except Shruti, all other Hindu scriptures are called Smriti, because they contain stories that people have memorized and written down from generation to generation
 sabhi smriti granth vedon kii prashansa karte hai
 They have a lower standard than the Vedas, but are easier to read and are read by most Hindus
 pramukh smriti granth hai:- itihaas--ramayana or mahabharat, bhagavad gita, puraana--, manusmriti, dharamshastra or dharmasutra, aagam shaastra
 There are 6 major parts of Indian philosophy - Sankhya philosophy, Yoga, justice, Vaiseshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta
 hindu dharmagranthon ke mutabik devtaa dharm ke to daanav adharm ke pratik hai
 But do you know that in mythological beliefs, the gods and goddesses are said to be the children of the same father, but different mothers
 iske mutabik dev-daanvon ke pita rishi kashyap hai
 At the same time, the name of the mother of the gods is Aditi and the name of the mother of the demons is Diti
 vishwa main adhiktam hindu jansankhya vaale 20 raashtra In ancient times the Aryans worshiped many deities with Vedic mantras and agni-yajna
 arya devataaon kii koi murti yaa mandir nahin banaate the
 The major Aryan deities were: Devaraja Indra, Agni, Soma and Varuna
 unke liye vaidic mantra padhe jate the or agni main ghi, doodh, dahi, jau, ityagi kii aahuti di jaati thi
 Prajapati Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are rarely mentioned at that time
 bharat ek vishaal desh he, lekin uski vishalata or mahanata ko ham tab tak nahin jaan sakate, jab tak ki use dekhen nahin
 This way many great men got attention, but twelve hundred years ago today, Adiguru Shankaracharya did a very important work for it
 unhonen chaaron dishaao main bharat ke chhoron par, chaar peeth sthapit uttar main badrinath ke nikat jyotipeeth, dakshin main rameshwaram ke nikat shringery peeth, purv main jagannathpuri main govardhan peeth or pashchim main dwarikapith

 Most Hindus are worshiped by idols of God
 unke liye murti ek aasaan sa saadhan he, jisamen ki ek hi niraakaar ishwar ko kisi bhi manachaahe sundar rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Hindus do not actually worship stone and iron, as some people understand
 murtiyan hinduon ke liye ishwar kii bhakthi karne ke liye ek saadhan maatr hai
 The places of worship of Hindus are called temples
 pracheen vaidic kaal main mandir nahin hote the
 The worship was then at the place of fire in which a gold idol was installed as a symbol of God
 ek najariye ke mutabik buddha or jain dharmon dwaara buddha or mahavir kii murtiyon or mandiron dwaara puja karne kii vajah se hindu bhi unase prabhavit hokar mandir banane lage
 Every temple is worshiped by one or more deities

 The temples are the best symbols of ancient and medieval Indian art

 Singhasan Battisi is a collection of folklores

 singhaasana battisi bhi 32 kathaon kaa sangrah he jisamen 32 putaliyaan vikramaditya ke vibhinn gunon kaa katha ke rup main varnan karti hai
 Throne Battisi is originally a Hindi version of the Sanskrit work Throneadvatrinsati, which is also known as Dwatrinshatputalika
 sanskrit main bhi iske mukhyatah do sanskaran hai
 uttari sanskaran "singhasanadvatrinshati" ke naam se tathaa dakshini sanskaran "vikramcharita" ke naam se uplabdh he
 The earlier versions are called Kshemendra Muni

 lokbhashaon main iske anuwaad hote rahe or puranic kathaon kii tarah bhartiya samaaj main maukhik parampara ke rup main rach-bas gaye

 But certainly nothing can be said about his creation

 Since each legend mentions Raja Bhoja, its creation period will be after the 11th century
 in kathaon kii bhoomika bhi katha hi he jo raja bhoj kii katha kahati he
 32 stories are told from the face of 32 effigies which are enshrined in a throne
 yah singhaasana raja bhoj ko vicitra paristhiti main praapt hota he
 One day, Raja Bhoja realizes that a simple shepherd is known for his justice, while he is absolutely illiterate and pastorally feeds the cows, buffaloes and goats of the potters of his own kingdom
 jab raja bhoj ne tahaqiqaat karai to pataa chalaa ki vah charvaaha saare faisale ek tile par chadhakar karata he
 King Bhoja's curiosity grew and he disguised himself and saw the shepherd decide on a complicated matter
 uske faisle or aatmavishvaas se bhoj itnaa adhik prabhavit hue ki unhone usase uski is adwitiya kshamta ke bare main jaananaa chaha
 When the shepherd, whose name was Chandrabhan, told that this power comes to him automatically after sitting on the mound, Bhoja decided to deliberately carve the mound
 jab khudaai sampann hui to ek rajsinghaasana mitti main dabaa dikhaa
 This throne represented an unprecedented form of workmanship
 isamen battis putaliyaan lagi thim tathaa keemtee ratna jade hue the
 When the dust and mud were cleaned, the beauty of the throne was seen
 use uthaakar mahal laayaa gaya tathaa shubh muhoort main raja kaa baithna nishchit kiya gaya
 As the king tried to sit, all the effigies started ridiculing the king

 Home science is the mode of education under which culinary science, nutrition, home economics, consumer science, children's upbringing, human development, interior decoration, clothing and apparel, house building etc
 are studied
 aitihaasik rup se jab baalkon ko krishi yaa 'shop' aadi kii shiksha di jane lagi to balikaon ke liye is vishay ke shikshan kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kii gayi
 As the name itself suggests, home science is related to home i
e
 home
 aam taur par log samajhate hai ki grih vigyaan ghar kii dekhbhaal or gharelu saamaan kii saaj-sambhaal kaa vishay he
 But their understanding of this is only partially true
 grih vigyaan kaa kshetra kaaphi vist t or vividhta bharaa he
 Its scope goes far beyond the 'home' limit and it is not limited to just cooking, washing clothes, stitching or embroidery etc
 vastav main keval yahi ek aisa vishay he jo yuva vidhyaarthiyon ko unke jivan ke do mahatvapurn lakshyon ke liye taiyaar karata he - ghar tathaa parivaar kii dekhbhaal or apane jivan main carrier athwa peshey ke liye taiyaari
 Nowadays, both men and women play equally the responsibilities of home and family and also participate equally in the preparation of better use of available resources to make their lives happier
 grih vigyaan athwa ghar ke vigyaan kaa sambandh aap se, aapke ghar se, aapke parivaar ke sadasyon se tathaa aapke sansadhano se judi sabhi chizon se he
 Its purpose is - to provide you and your family members full satisfaction by effective and scientific use of your resources
 grih vigyaan kaa arth he, aapke sansadhano ke prabhaavshaalee prabandhan kii kala tathaa ek aisa vigyaan, jo ek ghar ko swasth tathaa sanand banaae rakhane or aavashyaktaa padane par ek safal peshey ke chunaav main aapaki madad kare
 Home science teaches you the art of using things, which helps to create an overall order, beauty, and intelligent environment around
 iske saath hi yah ghar kii dekhbhaal se sambandhit vaigyanik jaankariyaan bhi pradaan karata he
 We can understand this easily by an example - Home Science provides information about the nutrients required for the body and also tells about their functions
 yah ek ’vigyaan’ he
 And when you serve food rich in these essential nutrients to your family, it is an 'art'
 vigyaan or kala kaa yah samanvay aapke jivan ke har kshetra main kaam aata he
 Some of them are as follows - grih vigyaan ke vividh kshetron kii padhai karne ke baad aap apane sansadhano kaa behatar prabandhan kar sakate hai
 If you encounter any kind of problem while doing so, home science will give you the right directions to solve it
 aisa karke aap ek prabhaavshaalee vyakti banate hai
 You can use this knowledge in the development of your home and life
 aap or aapke parivaar ke sadsy apni dakshataon ke upyog se apni aarthik sthiti main sudhaar laakar zyada santushti kaa anubhav kar sakate hai
 When you will be able to meet the needs of your family, only then they will also be able to fulfill the responsibilities of both the house and outside
 samay, urja, dakshata aadi kuch anya sansaadhan hai, jo prabandhan main sahaayak hote hai or isamen grih vigyaan aapaki bahut madad karata he
 Nowadays most of the women are working, who either go out of the house to work, or they run their own employment by staying at home
 iske falswaroop ghar kii jimmedaariyon main purushon kii sahabhaagita bhi badi he
 Since in our society traditionally men are not very active in the work of dhar, they experience a lot of difficulty in getting into this system
 aise main unhen ghar kii vibhinn pakshon ke bare main jaanane tathaa ghar ko sundar banane tathaa sahi tareeke se chalaane kaa hunar seekhney kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Home Science is the only subject which provides the necessary rehearsal and necessary information to the youth to become a successful householder, a responsible citizen and a good parent
 haalanki grih vigyaan shiksha ke kaaphi vist t kshetra main kaary kar rahaa he, kintu aaj bhi is vishay ko lekar aam aadmi ke man main bhram kii sthiti bani hui he
 And this confusion remains only because people think that home science is not able to give all the respect and status they want to achieve
 bhranti - grih vigyaan keval khaanaa pakaane, kapade dhone or silaai-kadhai ke kaamon tak simit he- aam logon kii dharna he ki isamen sirf yahi sab baaten padhai-sikhaai jaati he
 Therefore, parents of young girls easily get ready to teach them this subject
 ve sochate hai ki yah unhen baad ke jivan main jimmedaariyon kaa nirvaah karne main sahaayak siddh hoga
 The truth - cooking, washing and keeping clothes, and embroidery-weaving is a very small part taught under home science
 darasal iske dwaara ham apane jivan se judi sabhi aadharbhoot baaten sikhte hai- ki hamaara sharir kaise kaary karata he, ki hamen swasth rahane ke liye kis prakaar ke aahaar kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, ki apni tathaa vaataavaran kii swatchta ke liye kin niyamon kaa paalan karnaa aavashyak hota he, ki hamen bimariyon se bachane ke liye kya karnaa chahie tathaa jab ham tathaa hamaare athmiya jan biimaar hon, to kis prakaar kaa prabandhan karnaa chahie aadi
 In this, we learn about the choice of clothes to be used in various household functions
 bachche hamaare jivan kaa ek abhinn angrihain
 We all want their safe and proper development
 is paathyakram main ham sikhte hai ki janm ke purv or baad bacchon kaa vikaas kis prakaar hota he or ek achche tathaa jimmedaar naagarik ke rup main unke vikaas main ham kya bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 Apart from this, we also learn to manage our resources like time, energy and money, so that we experience more satisfaction with their maximum use
 bhranti- grih vigyaan kaa sambandh keval ladakiyon se he - bahut se log yah samajhate hai ki grih vigyaan keval ghar se sambandhit kaaryon kii shiksha detaa he, isliye ise keval ladakiyon ko hi padhanaa chahie
 Truth- Today both women and men share the responsibilities of the household equally, because today the structure of our society has changed a lot
 aaj sanyukt parivaar tut kar ekal pariwaron main badalane lage hai
 In such a situation, the responsibilities of the house have to be handled by the husband and wife themselves
 adhikansh mahilaayein ghar se baahar kaam par jane lagi hai, isliye purushon ko ghar kii jimmedaariyon ke bare main adhik se adhik shiksha kii jarurat badi he
 And the preparation or rehearsal of all these things can only be found in home science as a subject
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj anek yuva purush is vishay ko padhane kii taraf unmukh hue hai
 Misconception - It can be learned from your mother / grandmother too - People think that the things taught in home science are so easy that they can be easily learned from their mother / grandmother in the home
 iske liye ek vishay ke rup main grih vigyaan kii padhai karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Truth- It is true that girls learn a lot from home by watching their mother or grandmother working, but that is not enough
 bahut se kaam aise hai, jo paramparaagat rup main gharon main chalate chale aa rahe hai, lekin logon ko unka vaigyanik aadhaar nahin pataa he
 Take pickle for example
 sabhi jaanate hai ki achaar ko tel kii parat se dhaknaa padataa he, lekin jab aap unase puuchhenge ki aisa kyon kiya jaataa he, to aapaki maa ise nahin samajha paaengi
 But when you study home science, it will tell you that oil prevents the pickle elements from getting spoiled by the wind
 isi prakaar ke anek udhaaharan har kisi ke jivan main mil jaaenge
 It is important to note that if we know about what we are doing and why we are doing it then it becomes easier
 bhranti - grih vigyaan kii padhai carrier nimarn main sahaayak nahin he - zyaadaatar logon kaa yah bhi sochna he ki grih vigyaan chunki ghar ke bheetar kiye jane vaale kaaryon ke bare main shiksha detaa he, isliye carrier kii da shti se yah anupayogi he
 If a youth wants to earn a living, he should read a 'serious' subject
 sachai - grih vigyaan yuva ladke tathaa ladakiyon donon ke liye rojgaar ke anek avasar ulabdh karaata he
 Studying as a subject of home science in school can provide a lot of employment opportunities
 lekin iske liye aavashyak he ki anya vishyon kii tarah hi is vishay kii bhi aage tak padhai jari rakhen or kisi ek vishesh kshetra main visheshgyata praapt karen
 Some of the common employment opportunities arising by studying home science as a dietician in hospitals, as a fashion designer in a boutique, as a hostess / hostess or receptionist in hotels, as a teacher / teacher in schools / colleges, etc
 Huh
 grih vigyaan kii padhai ke baad aap kaaphi acchhee aay vaali or santoshjanak naukariyaan praapt kar sakate hai
 There are mainly five parts to home science
 ye nimnlikhit hai- Today, this science has developed so much that each of its organs has developed its own sub-divisions
 ye up-vibhaag nimnlikhit hai- The curriculum designed to make Indian women skilled modern housewives is called home science
 ise america main prachlit gharelu arthshaastra or britain main prachlit gharelu vigyaan kii shikshan saamagree ke mail-jol se taiyaar kiya gaya he
 In this course subjects such as domestic economics, hard-borne-silai, child-rearing, moral education and arrangement and hygiene in home affairs are included
 grih-vigyaan ke aalochak ise striyon ko parichit or simit gharelu bhoomika main baandhe rakhane, pitrusatta kaayam rakhane or striyon ko raajnneetik rup se niskriy banaaye rakhane kaa shadyantra maanate hai
 On the other hand, home science is also considered to be the bearer of modernism and nationalism to an early extent within the realm of the Indian home
 apane samay main anek nariwadi sanghathanon ne bharat main grih-vigyaan ko stri-adhikaron ke saath jod kar dekha he
 In this discourse, the house is uniquely considered a feminist entity
 yah vimarsh maanata he ki grih-vigyaan dwaara striyon ko naveenatam vaigyanik takneekon or aadhuniktam jaankaree dwaara parivaar-nirmaan kaa adhikaar miltaa he
 In this way, home science emerges as a component of the definition of the domestic aspect of modernity at the center of which a trained woman is entrusted with the physical, mental and moral development of the entire family
 aupniveshik kaal main stri-samanta or adhikaron ke liye sangharsh bhi chal rahaa tha or uske saath hi pitrusattatmak vyavastha banaaye rakhane ke liye dharm, parampara or sthapit saamaajik vyavastha kaa hawala dekar strion ko haashiye par banaaye rakhane kii muhim bhi jari thi
 In the midst of this struggle, efforts were made to connect women with modern education, but there were huge obstacles in educating them like men
 isi dauraan bhartiya striyon ko unke parivesh ke anuroop hi shikshit karne ke liye grih-vigyaan kaa pruthak adhyayan kshetra banaaya gaya
 Home science also included the ideal of making women a better housewife and developing as an educated citizen
 british prashasan ne bhi is kshetra main pahal lee
 a program was started to train women teachers for teaching of home science
 prashasan ne bhartiya samaaj- sudhaarkon ke saath mil kar sabase pehle vidhwaa striyon ko is prashikshan ke liye chunaa
 After training, these women could become financially independent
 prashasan vidhwaaon kii sthiti sudhaarney ke liye aavashyak samaaj- sudhaar jaise kaaryakramon ko puraatanapanthi samaaj ke baari virodh ke kaaran sthagit karne kaa icchhuk bhi tha
 In the initial phase of training of women teachers, most of the women were from Christian community or non-brahmin society
 lekin ucch varna ke kuch pramukh bhartiya samaaj sudhaarkon ne apane parivaar kii striyon ko bhi is prashikshan main bhaag lene ke liye utsahit kiya
 Many new educational and training institutes were established to popularize the teaching of home science in European secondary schools
 grih-vigyaan ko vaigyanik drushtikon pradaan karne ke liye iske prashikshan ko praayogic evam vyaavhaarik banaate hue shikshan-saamagree main vigyaan ke buniyadi siddhanton kaa samavesh kiya gaya
 The credit for publicly campaigning for women's rights in India goes to Swarna Kumari Devi, the daughter of Devendra Nath Thakur, a pioneer leader of the Brahmo Samaj and sister of Rabindranath Thakur
 unhone 1882 main kalakatta main vidhwaaon or garib striyon ko aarthik rup se swazlambi banane ke liye prashikshan dene kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Similarly, Pandita Ramabai Saraswati had organized a program to train women for employment through Arya Stree Samaj and Sharda Sadan in Pune
 1910 main swarna kumari devi kii putree sarala devi choudharani ne keval striyon ke liye bharat stri mandal kii sthapana karke striyon ko unke ghar par hi shikshit karne kaa abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 European missionaries and Indian social reformers were at the forefront of providing education to women in the early twentieth century
 lekin adhiktar striyon kii shiksha anaupchaarik taur par unke ghar par nijee shikshakon ke dwaara di jaati thi
 In fact, most reformers wanted to relate women's education to their domestic obligations so that they could bring qualitative improvement in the upbringing and lifestyle of their family-family
 is prakaar kii shiksha ke liye grih-vigyaan ko sarvottam vishay mana gaya
 Home science was introduced as the bearer of the role of the ideal wife-mother-house Lakshmi to the women trained in home science to establish the ideal form of the concept of 'home' in Indian society
 grih-vigyaan ne bhartiya ‘ghar’ ko ek aisi prayogshaala bana diya jiske daayre main parivaar evam samaaj main vyapak sudhaaron ke abhiyaan kaa armbh ho saktaa tha
 Along with this, to make home science acceptable to the enlightened-minded Indians, it was presented as a medium which was effective in giving Indian women an honorable place in their own home and to center women in comprehensive social reform
 Could play grih-vigyaan kaa vichaar upniveshwaad-virdohi andolan main prachaarit kii ja rahi adarsh stri-chhavi ke anukool bhi baithta tha
 After Gandhi took over the leadership of the movement, ordinary Indian women also started taking part in it in large numbers
 gandhi ne striyon ko jodne ke liye maan-patni-bahan kii adarsh niyaswaarth chhavi kaa dohan kiya
 Similarly in the Hindu nationalist interpretation, Bharat Bhumi was represented as Bharat Mata
 tamilnadu main bhi tamil bhashaa ke andolan main tamil bhashaa va tamil rashtriyata ko maan ke rup main darshaya gaya
 The revival of Tamil asmita and the propaganda of Tamil pride as a motherly figure promoted women as house owners and maternal powers
 parinamswaroop na keval atmasamman andolan main striyon ne badi sankhya main hissaa liya, balki tamilnadu ke saamaanya logon main bhi stri-shiksha ke prati jaagrukta viksit hui
 The top leadership of the Tamil movement also advocated such reforms for women to make the role of wife and mother effective
 grih-vigyaan ke bhartiyakaran or iske prasar main kuch bhartiya striyon ne pramukh bhoomika nibhaai
 Parvati Bai Athawale, belonging to Dhondo Keshav Karve's widow ashram, went on a trip to America in 1918 where she saw how the use of scientific methods in domestic work could be of great benefit to India as well
 isi prakaar baroda ke pradhanmantri kii putree hansaa mehta ne bhi 1920-21 ke dauraan america main gharelu arthshaastra ke prashikshan kaa adhyayan kiya or waapas lautakar maharaj saiyaji raav vishvavidhyalay main ek stri mahavidhyalay kii sthapana kii jisamen grih-vigyaan paathyakram kaa praaroop american visheshgy ain gilcrist strang ne taiyaar kiya
 Strong's book 'domestic Science for High School in India', published in 1931, has long been considered the most standard text book of Indian home science
 bhartiya stri sanghathan ne bhi grih-vigyaan ke anaupchaarik prashikshan kaa kaarykram chalaaya or isse sambandhit jaankaree ke prasar ke liye ek patrika stridharm kaa prakaashan kiya
 In it, articles of Journal of Home Economics published from America were published
 tamilnadu ke madras shahar main anek devdasiyon ko samaaj main punervasit karne ke uddeshy se grih-vigyaan kaa prashikshan diya gaya taaki ve gharelu karmchaaree kii tarah kaam main lagaai ja saken
 In 1926, some members of the Indian Women's Organization considered women's education as their primary objective in place of political freedom and left the Indian Women's Organization and established the All India Women's Conference
 is naye samooh ne striyon ko grih-vigyaan main prashikshit karne ke liye 1932 main dilli main ladi irvin college kii sthapana kii
 Malti Patwardhan, a founding member of the Bharatiya Mahila Sangathan, promulgated the topics of social issues of women, such as employment, legal-constitutional changes related to women rights, fragmentation of patriarchal joint family, along with promotion of home science in streedharma magazine

 Goenka said that its serials are either running or have been completed two or three years before today
 goyanka kehete hai, "ham chaar shos se shuru karenge jisase hamen ek din main lagbhag chaar ghante kaa content mil jayega
 Later it will be increased

 He said, "according to our research the base of audience of particular category has become more important in the last few years and they need a special product
 "yah zee tivi athwa star plus se pratispardhi nahin he
 According to Goenka, in olden times, programs of Zee TV etc
 were made for a small group of people who were prosperous and who had the resources like TV, but in today's time, they have to make content selection keeping in mind the special rich class of people

 In the early 1970s, the Boeing 747, mcdonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L-1011 Tristar became the first generation wide-structure passenger airliners to enter service
 In 1978, Boeing unveiled three new models: a twin-engined 757 to replace the honorable 727, a twin-engine 767 to challenge the Airbus A300, and a Tridget 777 concept competing with the DC-10 and L-1011
 
 The mid-sized 757 and 767 achieved marketing success, partly due to cross-ocean twinjet operations governing regulations of the 1980s (wide-range twin-engine operational performance standard)
 According to these regulations, twin-engined airliners were allowed to cross the ocean for three hours from emergency interchangeable airports

 In 1986, Boeing vetoed proposals for an amplified 767, temporarily named 767-X, to target replacement marketing of first-generation wide-bodied airliners such as the DC-10 and to cater to existing 767 and 747 models in the company's lineup

 The initial proposal included winglets as well as longer aircraft and larger wings than the current 767

 Airline customers were unhappy with the 767-x's proposals and instead wanted a wider airlock transverse-cut, fully flexible internal configuration, less than intercontinental-range capability and a lower operating cost than any 767 expansion airliner

 On 8 December 1989, Boeing began offering 777s to airlines

 The eight airlines that contributed to the design process became known within Boeing as the "working Together" group
 In the first meeting of the group in January 1990, a 23-page questionnaire was distributed to airlines where they were asked what they wanted to include in the new design

 On 14 October 1990, United Airlines became an early customer of the 777 when it ordered 34 Pratt and Whitney-operated aircraft valued at US $ 11 billion, with a choice of 34 additional aircraft
 During the development phase, United also planned to replace the aging DC-10
 United wanted the new aircraft to have the ability to fly from Chicago to Hawaii, Chicago to Europe and Denver, a warm and elevated airport, to non-stop air
 The Etopes certification was also a priority for United, with a cross-border portion of United's air routes

 In 1952, with the inspiration of the Sangh, considering the education sector as life-practice, some loyal people got involved in this sacred work
 unhone navdith peedi ko suyogy shiksha or shiksha ke saath sanskaar dene ke liye “saraswati shishu mandir” kii aadharshila gorakhpur main main pakki baag main paanch rupee masik kiraaye ke bhawan main rakhi

 pati kii mrity ke uparant maharani shrimati vaanivilas ne sannidhan se sangrakshika ke rup main badi yogyata se kaary kiya
 The joint is the places in the body where the two bones meet each other, such as the shoulder, elbow or hip joint
 inkaa nirmaan sharir main gati sulabh karne or yantric aadhaar hetu hota he
 They are classified on the basis of structure and their functions
 sharir main visheshkar teen prakaar kii sandhiyaan pai jaati hai: achal sandhi, ardhachal sandhi tathaa chal sandhi
 In these treaties, the joints of the bones are combined
 donon asthiyon ke bich kuch bhi antar nahin hota
 Due to this, there is no movement at the confluence of bones
 donon asthiyaan tantu utak dwaara aapas main judi rahati hai
 Three categories are found in these treaties: in sandhiyon main asthiyon ke bich main upasthi rahati he tathaa gati kam hoti he
 Two distinctions are found in this category
 in sandhiyon kii gati abaadh hoti he
 The following characteristics are found in them: 1
 kor sandhi ke sandhayak prishth ek duusare ke anukool aise ban jate hai ki asthiyaan keval ek hi aksh par gati kar sakati hai, jaise kakuhani kii sandhi; 2
 In Vivartika Sandhi, one bone becomes like a coil, and the other moves like a tenon of a door, and rotates in it, such as the forearm joint; 3
 sthulkaay sandhi main ek lanbaa sa gadha ban jaataa he or duusari asthi unnatodar or lambotaree si ho jaati he
 This part resides in the fabrication of the first bone and the bones are tied together by the nerves, such as the joint ie wrist joint
 inamen aakuchan, vistaar, abhivartan, apvartan, paryaavartan ityadi kriyaayein hoti hai
 4
 In the parya pact, the shape of a bone is similar to that of a gene
 yah ek disha main avatal or duusari disha main uttal ho jaati he, jaise anguthe kii manibandh karabh sandhi; 5
 In the ulukhal pact, a bone is formed
 duusari asthi kaa ek praant kuch gol pind kaa rup dhaaran karke is gadhe main sthit ho jaataa he
 The pact is strengthened by the plexus and nerve, which can move in each direction of the pact and rotate on its own axis
 skandh sandhi or nitamb sandhi iske udhaaharan he
 6
 Simple Sandhi - Its pages are so folded and the position of the nerves is such that the bones can move a little bit here and there, like the vertebral joint
 sharir main sandhiyon kaa prayojan gati hota he
 Therefore, their composition is also such that the bones can move and at the same time do not be dislocated from their place
 prayek sandhi par ek tantuk yaa snaivik koshika chadhi rahati he, jo sampurna sandhiyon ko dhakati hui sandhi main bhaag lene vaali asthiyon ke siron par lagi rahati he
 Special parts of this fibrillar develop and become stronger
 in bhaagon ko snaayu kehete hai, jo bhinn bhinn sandhiyon main bhinn bhinn sankhya main hoti he
 There is a lubricant inside the fibroblast, which reaches over the bones and covers them
 jin sandhiyon ke bheetar sanghayak chakrika rahati he, vahaan snehak str kii ek parat saghyank chakrika ke upar bhi faili hoti he, jisase snehak str tathaa sanghayak chakrika ke bich main, snehak kala kii khaali main, snehak dravya upasthit ho jaataa he
 This lubricant fluid keeps the parts of the arthritic bone smooth and prevents them from rubbing
 snaayu tantumay utak ke samaantar sutron ke laben patt hote hai
 They connect both the ends of the two bones
 inke bhi donon sire do asthiyon ke avistari bhaagon par lage rahete hai
 It is situated outside the muscle cell and some inside
 bhitari snaayu kii sankhya kam hoti he
 It keeps muscles on nerves
 in aavarnon kii do paraton ke bich ek drav hota he, jo visheshkar un sthanon par paaya jaataa he, jahaan snaayu asthi ke sampark main aati he
 Due to this, there is no damage in the nerves during the time of the work of the treaty
 yah bhinn aakaar kii jhilli hoti he, jisaki snehak kala kii koshika main gadha snigdh dravya bharaa rahata he
 It rests more between the pages of the ashes that rub on each other, or the treaties that only move
 prayek chal sandhi main mansapeshiyon kii sikudan or prasar se nimnlikhit kriyaayein hoti he : In fact, the effect produced by the feeling and quality of an object is called induction, when both things are not in contact
 is prakaar jab koi vastu duusari vastu se alag hote hue bhi usapar apana prabhaav aropit karti he, tab use preran kaha jaataa he
 There are three types of induction effects in electrical engineering: 1
 vidyutsthaitik preran 2
 Magnetic induction 3
 vidyucchumbakeey preran In electrostatic induction, an object induces charge at nearby electrodes
 jab koi vidyut aaweshit padaarth, prithvi se vidyutarodhi kisi sanchaalak ke nikat aata he, tab chaalak ke kuch electron aaweshit ho jate hai or chaalak ke ek sire par ekatrit hokar puure chaalak ko hi aaweshit kar dete hai
 These actions, in fact, are charged and collect at one end of the driver and charge the entire driver
 yah kriya, vastav main aaweshit padaarth dwaara preran se duusare vidyucchalkon ko aaweshit karne kii he or vidyutsthaitik preran kehalaati he
 Magnetic induction is the act of accepting magnetism by a magnetic substance placed in a magnetic field
 yadi koi chumbakeey padaarth kisi dand chumbak ke paas laayaa jaae, to uske upar bhi chumbakeey prabhaav ho jayega
 If the electromagnetic induction is using the magnetic property of the current, then the alternating current is flowing, then its magnetic field will also be of the alternating current corresponding to the current
 is prakaar chumbakeey abhivah kaa rup bhi pramyavarti hoga
 This affluence is closely associated with the drivers of the second horoscope, according to their alternating nature, with the electrifying force or the VVA
 Generates farrede ke siddhant ke anusaar, kisi chaalak se sambhddha abhivah main parivartan, usamen vi
vaa
ba
 kii utpatti karata he; jiskaa pariman, abhivah parivartan kii gati ke baraabar hota he
 Thus, in both the coils without contact and in different circuits, by induction, the second coil is called VVB
 Is generated and in the event of completion of its circuit, current also starts flowing
 is dhara ko duusari kundali ke aar paar e dharamapi jodakar gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 Indicator of dharamapi indicates etymology of the stream in the horoscope
 prerit vi
vaa
ba
 ko ek sugrahi vishleshan dharamapi dwaara mapa ja saktaa he
 It will also be known that the magnitude of the voltage is proportional to the wrap number of both coils
 yadi pehali kundali main 100 lapeten hon or duusari main 1000, to duusari kundali main prerit voltata pehali kundali main aropit voltata se 10 guna adhik hogi
 The most important device of the electric current system, the transformer, is based on this principle
 iske dwaara kam voltata kii vidyut shakti ko adhik voltata par parivartit kar dur dur tak pareshit kiya jaataa he or phir usee prakaar use kam voltata par parivartit kar upyog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Electromagnetic induction can occur in two forms
 ek to sthitik rup main, jaisaa upar kaha gaya he, jisamen donon kundaliyaan sthitik hoti hai or vi
vaa
ba
 kii utpatti, abhivah bandhata main parivartan ke kaaran hoti he
 This is possible only in alternating current
 yadi pehali kundali main disht dhara pravaahit kii jaae to abhivah bandhataon main parivartan kaa prashn hi nahin uthta
 But even if the direction and magnitude of the flow is constant, if the driver is moving, then as a result of the cutting of the flow, there is no change in the load
 Will originate vastut:, adhikansh vidyut mashine isi siddhant par aadhaarit he
 If a conductor rotates in a magnetic field, there is a force in it
 Originates from is prakaar utpann hue vi

 Only on the principle of induction Does not originate only; But there can also be the origin of a conflation
 ghurni chumbakeey kshetra main chaalkon par yah bal kriyasheel hota he, jo unhen ghuma saktaa he
 Induction motor clarity is based on this principle

 ] Is different from that, despite being in the tradition of poetry
 "hariudh" ji ne kaha he - maine shri krishnachandra ko is granth main ek mahapurush kii bhanti ankit kiya he, brahm karke nahin
 Krishnacharit is written in such a way that even modern people can agree
 mahapurush ke rup main ankit hote hue bhi "priypravas" ke krishna main vahi alokik sphurti he jo avtari brahmapurush main
 The poet has depicted Krishna in a psychological way, his personality is sympathetic, derivative and ritualistic
 krishna ke charitra kii tarah "priypravas" kii radha ke charitra main bhi naveenta he
 There is no perversion, it is the severity of the agony
 usne krishna ke karmyog ko hridyangam kar liya he
 His love for Krishna has become universal and his pain has become public service
 premika devi ho gai he, vah kahati hai : Although Krishna is mentioned as a great man in "priapravasa", his form in it is incidental
 ve visheshat: paariwarik or saamaajik swajan hai
 As is evident from the name of the book, the main theme is "priyapravas", the disconnection of the beloved Krishna of family and society

 This is the 'vivid Tukanta' or epic epic
 iske purv khadi boli main mahakavy ke rup main atukant kaa abhaav tha
 Hariudh ji in his elaborate role of "priyapravasa" considers the need for Atukant for his epic and verses appropriate to it
 atukant unke liye "bhashasaundarya" kaa "saadhan" he
 With regard to the verses and language he has said - "sanskrit circles are very suitable for writing different rhyming poetry - the language of this book is Sanskrit based due to some Sanskrit circles and mostly due to my interest"
 "priypravas" yadhyapi sanskritbahul or samaasgunfit he, tathaapi isaki bhashaa main yathasthaan bolchaal ke shabdon kaa bhi samavesh he

 The first two stories appeared in the Beatons' Christmas Annals in 1887 and the Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890 respectively
 The character's popularity increased immensely with the introduction of the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine in 1891

 Since 1881, the description is that 221B Baker Street, London, was the home of Holmes from where he runs his own private detective agency
 221B satraa kadam upar ek flats he jise ek puraani pandulipi main sadak kaa "upree chor" kaha gaya he
 By the time Dr
 Watson arrived, Holmes worked alone, rarely employing agents from a small section of the city, with a large number of informants and a group of market children whom he called the Baker Street Irregulars
 irregulars teen kahaniyon main dikhaai dete hai, "da sin of da four", "a study in skarlet" or "da adventure of da crucked main"
 Holmes's family is rarely described
 kahaniyon main uske mata-pita kii charchaa nahin he or vah keval itnaa kahata he ki uske purvaj "gramin sardaar" the
 In "the Adventure of the Greek Interpreter", Holmes claims that his great-uncle was the French artist Vernet

 Mycroft has a unique position in the administrative service as an on-the-go database of all aspects of memory or government policies
 bataaya gaya he ki avlokan or anumiti ke maamle main microft kii kshamta sherl se kahin zyaada he
 However, he lacks the energy and passion of Sherlock and loves to spend his leisurely time at the Diogenes Club, which has been called "a club of London's most non-sociable people"
 homes ke anya bhai-bahan hai yaa nahin yah spasht nahin he
 In "the Adventure of the Copper Beaches", Holmes says, "I confess that this is not the situation in which i would like to see my sister", which makes some people anticipate her existence
 lekin aisa vah ek maamle main ek mahila ko, apni bahan jaisi maan kar chetavanee dene ke liye kahata he, isliye yah keval ek alankarik bhashaa ho sakati he
 Holmes shares most of his business time with his good friend and chronological recorder, Watson, who lived with Holmes briefly before his marriage in 1887 and again after his wife's death; Her house, her landlady, is maintained by Mrs
 Hudson

 phir bhi, watasan ke saath homes kii dosti nihsandeh uskaa sabase mahatvapurn rishta he
 In many stories, Holmes' affection for Watson — often hidden behind his cold, intellectual outward appearance — is exposed
 "da adventure of da thri garidebs main, ek khalanaayak ke saath takaraav main watasan ghayal ho jaataa he; haalanki goli kaa ghaav "bahut satahi" siddh hota he, watasan homes kii pratikriya se aahlaadit ho jaataa he: In total, Holmes has been described as working actively for twenty-three years, during which Watson wrote seventeen of his cases

 Only one case, described by Holmes himself and which he was investigating as an amateur, occurs during the detective's retirement
 homes ne aadaton or jivan-style ke maamle main khud ko "fakkad" ke rup main varnit kiya he
 According to Watson, Holmes is an eccentric who has no connection with contemporary standards of cleanliness or orderliness
 ek praarambhik kahani main, watasan, homes kaa is prakaar varnan karata he: What others find to be chaos is what Holmes sees as a repository of useful information
 kahaniyon main homes, betaratib kaagazaat or kalakritiyon ke apane bikhare jaal main dubkee laga kar bilkul vishisht dastauez yaa anya koi vastu jisaki use talash he, khoj nikaalata he
 In terms of personal hygiene, by contrast, Holmes is described in "the Hound of the Baskervilles" as a "cat-like" lover of personal cleanliness
 kisi bhi rup main yah uske peshey ke nitant vyaavhaarik anugaman main baadha utpann karata hua prathit nahin hota, tathaapi; homes kii pehali kahani,"a study in skarlet" main uske haath acid ke daag se gande ho gaye hai, jabaki baad main homes apane hi khun kii buundon kaa upyog rasinic prayog ke liye karata he

 Nor does Watson condemn Holmes's readiness to turn a truth or break a law where he believes Is that it is morally justified
 homes ko ek deshbhakt ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya he, jo kai kahaniyon main rashtriya suraksha ke maamalon main sarkaar kii taraf se kaam kar rahaa he

 use prasiddhi kii ichha nahin he or vah aam taur par apane kaary ke liye police ko saarvajanik rup se shrey lene kii anumati dekar santusht rahata he
 It is often that when Watson publishes his stories, Holmes's role in the case becomes clear
 homes ke aacharan ko tatasth or thanda prastut kiya gaya he
 Yet in the midst of an adventure, with remarkable passion, Holmes can show the sparkle
 uski pravriti main pradarshnakarita he or ek apradhi ko pakadaney or uski kalai kholane ke liye vah vyapak jaal taiyaar karata he, aksar watasan yaa scotland yard nirikshakon main se ek ko prabhavit karne ke liye
 Holmes occasionally uses drugs, especially when there is a shortage of excitatory cases
 vah cocaine kaa aadi he, jise ek saat pratishat ke ghol main ek vishesh sui ke prayog se jise vah ek chamade ke khol main rakhata he, chubhota he
 Holmes also uses opium occasionally, but expresses his disapproval when he visits an opium base
 19veen sadi ke uttarardh main sabhi teen, england main jaays the
 By showing no medical objection to Holmes' drug use, Dr
 Watson depicts the Victorian medical fanatic
 naitik rup se, vah apane dost kii aadat kii, ise jasoos kii "ekmaatr buraai" bataate hue ninda karte hai or homes ke maansik swasthya or utkrisht buddhi par iske sambhavit asar ko lekar chintaa vyakt karte hai
 In later narratives, Watson claims to have removed Holmes from drugs
 phir bhi, uske chikitsak mitra ke anusaar, homes ek nashedi bana rahata he jisaki aadat "mari nahin, balkee keval so rahi thi
 " haalanki shuru main use 221B baker street main apane aaramdaayak nivas ke kiraye ko saajha karne ke liye watasan kii jarurat rahati he, "da adventure of da daaing detective" main watasan khulaasa karte hai, jab homes akelaa rahata tha tab "mujhe koi andeh nahin he ki ghar ko shaayad us keemat par kharida gaya hoga jo homes apane kamare ke liye bhugtan karata he," yah ingit karte hue ki usne apane vyavhaar se ek acchhee aay utpann kii, haalanki yah thik se kabhi nahin pataa chalaa ki vah apni sevaaon ke liye kitna shulk letaa he
 He says in "the Problem of Thor Bridge" that "my professional fee is at a certain level
 main unhen badalata nahin hum, sirf jab main unhen puri tarah maaf kar detaa hum 


 " This is stated in a context when a customer offered him twice his fee; However, it is possible that wealthy clients provide Holmes with much higher remuneration than his standard fee: In "the Adventure of the Final Problem", Holmes states that the government of France and the royal residence of Scandinavia gave him sufficient money for his services
 So that he can retire comfortably, while Watson in "the Adventure of Black Peter" indicates that Holmes refuses to help the rich and powerful He would have paid taxes if he did not like their case, whereas he devoted a whole week's time to the affairs of highly polite customers
 "a cese of aaidentity" main homes, watasan ko yah bhi bataata he ki "a scandle in bohemia" ke baad, bohemia ke raja ne use ek sunaharaa sunghni dibba diya or dach shahi parivaar se use ek shandaar anguthi mili; "da adventure of da bruce- partington plance" main homes ko ek panna nirmit taai-pin maharani victoria se praapt hota he
 Other mementoes of Holmes' cases are a gold guinea from Irene Adler and a signed thank-you letter from the President of France and the Legion of Honor The Adventure of the Golden pins-nez "the Adventure of the" for capturing an assassin named Huert "holmes rubs his hands with glee" at the Primary School when the Duke of Holderness writes to Zodiac, which also surprises Watson and then Che
 The pats, saying that "I am a poor man," an event that could be dismissed as a tendency toward ironic humor that Holmes

 Holmes, for his expenses, charges money from customers and can claim any reward offered to solve the problem: he says in "the Adventure of the Speckled Band" that Miss Stoner could pay the expenses she incurred
 And requests that "the red-headed League" bank compensate for the expenses incurred on the case
 "holmes has his wealthy banker client to pay the costs incurred in retrieving the stolen gems in The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet, and he also claims the reward that banker announced for the finder Was
 homes ko prabhavit karne vaali ekmaatr mahila thi ireni edler, jo homes dwaara hameshaa "vah aurat" ke rup main sambodhit kii gai

 edler un chand mahilaon main se ek he jo homes kii tamaam kahaniyon main uddhrut kii gayi hai, haalanki vah vastav main keval ek hi kahani, "a scandle in bohemia" main vyaktigat rup se upasthit hoti he
 In one story, "the Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton" becomes Holmes' match for the wedding, but only with the desire to gather information for his case
 He shows a clear interest in the way a lot of attractive female clients get in the way
 ,
 Holmes essentially "showed no further interest in her client when she moved out of the center of one of her problems
" " homes ne unke yauvan, saundarya or urja ko kisi bhi romani hit se alag, anupranit karne vaala paaya
 Such episodes reflect Holmes' fascination, yet there is no sign of any serious or long-term attachment, except in the case of Adler
 watasan ne likhaa he ki homes ko "mahilaon se ghrinaa" he lekin " saath anugrah paane kaa ek vicitra tarika he" homes kahata he,"main stri jati kaa purna man se prashansak nahin hum"; vastav main vah paata he "mahilaon kii manshaa

 In Sign of the Four, Watson cites Holmes as "a human being, a calculating machine," and Holmes is quoted as saying, "it is most important, to make his decisions by personal qualities Should not be allowed to be prejudiced
 a client is just one unit for me - a factor in the problem
 Emotional qualities are opposed to clear logic
 main aapako vishwaas dilaataa hum ki aaj tak jis aurat ko sabase aakarshak aurat maine paaya use beemaa ke paise ke liye teen chote bacchon ko jehar dene ke jurm main faansee par lataka diya gaya
 

 "it refers to Holmes' reluctance to make connections with women in general and with the client in particular, as Watson said" Sometimes you see a positive inhumanity in you

" watasan likhata he ki jab ki vah unhen naapsand or un par avishvaas karata he, phir bhi vah ek "udaar virdohi" he
 Holmes's primary intellectual investigative method is the permissible logic of solving a crime "with a drop of water", he writes, "that a logical person can guess the probability of the Atlantic or Niagara without seeing one or hearing the other
" Holmes's stories often begin with a display of the courageous talent of his "permissiveness"
 yah tarkikon or tark main ruchi rakhane waalon ke liye thodaa ruchikar he ki ve vishleshan karne kaa prayaas karen ki apni anumiti ke dauraan homes kya kar rahaa he
 Homogeneous permission appears to be constructed from conclusions that are primarily based on either straightforward, plausible principles that are the result of cautious inductive studies such as Holmes's study of various types of cigar ashes or the best explanation Is the conclusion
 homes ke sidhe-sapaat vyaavhaarik siddhanton kaa swarup aam taur par,"agar 'p', to 'q', hota he jahaan 'p' drishyman saboot he or 'q' vah he jo saboot ingit karata he
 But there are intermediate principles as well, as can be seen in the following example
 "a scandle in bohemia" main homes anumiti karata he ki watasan haal hi main bahut bhigaa hua tha or uski "jo naukaraani ladki thi vah bahut hi foohad or laaparvaah thi"
jab vismit hokar watasan poochta he ki homes yah baat kaise jaanata he to homes jawaab detaa he: In this case, Holmes used several associated theories: spasht dhang se aise siddhant lagu karke homes yah anumaan lagane main sakasham he ki: "the edges of Watson's shoes are strewn with parallel erosion"; From "watson's maid is clumsy and careless"; And "watson has been very wet lately and went out in dirty weather
 " Permissive arguments enable Holmes to effectively disclose a stranger's occupation, such as a retired sergeant of the Marines in a Study in Scarlett; The former carpenter of a ship in the Red-headed League who became a Mahajan; And a billiard-marker and an artillery retired NCO in The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter
 Similarly, by studying inanimate objects, Holmes is able to draw surprisingly detailed conclusions about their owners, including Watson's pocket-watch in The Sign of the Four, as well as other stories containing a cap, a pipe, And a stick
 ek baar usne dher saare saboot jamaa kiye or sambhav vyakhyaaon kii anumiti kii or ek samaadhaan prastut karne ke liye homes us ek vyakhya kii taraf badhata he jo is maamle ke sabhi tathyon se mail khaati he
 As Holmes tells Watson, "when you have removed the impossible, whatever is left, however unlikely, must be true
" homes abhinay or chhadam vesh banane main gahari ruchi pradarshit karata he
 In many stories, he bears such a natural disguise to gather evidence that even Watson does not catch him, as in "the Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton", in The Man with the Twisted Lip and a Scandal in Bohemia
 In other exploits, Holmes pretends to be injured or sick to make his case effective, or to blame those involved, such as "the Adventure of the Dying Detect The Tiv "
 pistaul homes or watasan apane saath pistaul rakhte hai; watasan ke maamle main aksar uski puraani sarvice revolver
 However, Watson only discusses the use of these weapons on seven occasions

 It is discussed in "gloria Scott" that Holmes practiced the sword
 chaabuk kai kahaniyon main homes ek chaabuk se las dikhataa he
 He uses it in The Adventure of the Speckled Band to kill a poisonous snake and comes close to killing a thug in a Case of Identity
 "da red-heded lig" main ek "chaabuk" ke prayog se homes, jon clay ke haathon se ek pistaul gira detaa he
 Boxing Holmes is described as a formidable fighter with bare fingers
 da sin of da four main, homes apana parichay ek peshewar mukkebaaz ko is rup main detaa he: On several occasions in the stories, Holmes became embroiled in a clandestine battle with his emerging rivals, where he was essentially the winner
 In "gloria Scott" it is reiterated that Holmes is trained as a boxer
 marshall art da adventure of da empti house main homes watasan ko bataata he ki marshall art kaa istemaal karke kaise usne professor moriarti ko kaabo main kiya or apane virdohi ko rhishenbakh jalprapaat par aisa pataka ki uski mrityu ho gai
 He states that "however, i have some knowledge, of the Japanese system of baritsu, ka or wrestling, which has proved very useful to me at times
 " "baritsu" naam, vaastavik-jivan ke marshall art bartitsu ke liye ek sandarbh prathit hota he
 In the very first story a Study in Scarlet, something about Holmes's background is given
 1881 ke purvardh main, use rasayan vigyaan ke ek swatantra chaatr ke rup main pesh kiya gaya he jisaki kai vividh jigyaasu ruchiyan hai, jisamen se lagbhag sabhi ekanishtha hokar use aparaadhon ko sulajhane main behatar banane ke rup main prakat huin

homes vaigyanik tareeke kaa kadai se paalan karata he or tarkon or prekshan or anumiti kii shakti par jor detaa he
 In a Study in Scarlett, Holmes claims that he does not know that the Earth revolves around the Sun, since such information is irrelevant to his work
 pratyaksh rup se watasan se yah tathy sunne ke baad, vah kahata he ki vah turant use bhuulane kii koshish karegaa
 vah kahata he ki uskaa maananaa he ki jaankaree ko sangrahit karne ke liye mastishk kii ek simit kshamta he or isliye nirarthak baaten seekhney se uski upyogi chijen seekhney kii kshamta keval kam hi hogi
dow watasan baad main homes kii kshamta kaa akalan is prakaar karata he: Even at the end of a Study in Scarlet, it is shown that Holmes knows Latin and that there is no need for translation of the original Roman proverbs, although the direct utility of language knowledge for espionage work is doubtful
 baad kii kathaayen bhi suchi kaa khandan karti hai
 Despite the possible ignorance of Holmes's politics, in "A Scandal in Bohemia" he immediately realizes the true identity of the so-called "count von Krum"
 gaiyr-sansanikhej sahitya ke sambandh main, uskaa bhaashan bible, shakespeare, yahaan tak ki goethe ke sandarbhon se paripurna he
 In addition, in The Adventure of the bruce-partington Plans, Watson informs that in November 1895, "holmes immerses himself in a monopoly he took from the Polyteous Mottes of Lasas" - a highly esoteric field, for which Holmes Will have to unravel his memory with a vast store of information, which has nothing to do with the fight of crime - such a broad knowledge that his disobedience has to be Year is considered "final word" on
 baad kii kathaayen is dharna kaa khandan karatin hai ki homes tab tak kuch jaanane kaa icchhuk nahin he jab tak ki vah uske vyavsaay ke liye avilamb praasangik naa ho; da vaili of fier ke duusare adhyay main, homes to balki ghoshnaa kar detaa he ki "sabhi gyaan jasoos ke liye upyogi hota he" or da adventure of da loyns main ke ant main vah apane aap ko "vicitra dharnashakti vaali smriti kaa ek sarv-vishay pathak" ke rup main paribhaashit karata he
 " homes ek sakasham kuta visheshgy bhi he
 He addresses Watson, "I am quite familiar with all forms of code writing, and i am the author of a trivial discourse on the subject, in which i am analyzing a hundred and sixty different words
" One such scheme is solved in The Adventure of the Dancing Men using frequency analysis
 bhautik saboot kaa homes kaa vishleshan vaigyanik or sateek, donon he
 His methods include the use of latent prints such as footprints and hoof prints and cycle tracks to identify action at a crime scene, the use of tobacco ashes and cigarette turrets to identify criminals, a fraud bust
 To compare type letters, use gunpowder residue to expose two murderers ", compare bullets obtained from two crime sites and Even the earliest use of fingerprints
 In a Scandal in Bohemia, Holmes also demonstrates his knowledge of psychology, where he lures Irene Adler into cheating him about the picture hiding, which rests on this "premise
" That an unmarried woman would want her most precious thing in the event of a fire while a married woman would pounce on her child
 In the first story, a Study in Scarlet, apane jivan kii uttejnaa ke baavjood homes sevanivrutt hokar madhumakhi paalan karne sasex downs chale jate hai or is vishay par ek pustak likhte hai,"practical hand book of bi culture, wyeth sam obsarveshns apon da segrigeshan of da queen

 Although Sherlock Holmes is not the original novel Detective, his name has become a quote
 uski kahaniyon main kai jasusi kahani alankaar shaamil hai jaise, vafaadaar lekin kam budhimaan sahaayak, ek bhoomika jiske liye dow watasan adarsh ban gaya he
 Sherlock Holmes has sometimes been used in scientific literature
 redford uski prabuddhata par vichaar karte hai
 Using Conan Doyle's stories as data, Redford estimates Sherlock Holmes' IQ in three different ways and concludes that his intelligence is indeed very high
 snidar 19veen sadi ke madhya or uttarardh ke vigyaan or aparaadhashastra ke prakaash main homes ke tareekon kii jaanch karte hai
 Kempster compares the neuroscience skills demonstrated by Holmes

 They throw light on aspects of Doyle's books that are currently favorable about expertise, aspects that are inconceivable and aspects that suggest further research
 conan doyal dwaara likhit chappan laghu kathaayen or chaar upanyaas homian dwaara kanoon kahi gai hai
 Early scholars of this law include Ronald Knox of Britain and Christopher Morley of New York
 shradhanjali swaroop, kam athwa adhik maatra main lekhakon ne sherl homes, conan doyal, yaa kahaniyon ke paatro se kai pop samskruti sandarbh nirmit kiye hai
 Such cues serve to develop a plot, increase the intellectual level of the part or treat it as an Easter egg for an observant audience
 kuch to mukhar rahe hai jinhone homes ko ek naveen setting main ek charitra ke rup main prastut kiya, yaa thodaa adhik sookshm sanket, jaise kii ek apartment sankhya 221B main rahete hue ek taarkik charitra kaa nirmaan

D

 The simplest reference is often to give anyone who does any kind of espionage work, wearing a hunting hat and cloak
 Another rich area in terms of pop culture is the ancestry and descendants of Holmes, but really the writer's imagination is the only limit

 Holmes's fan period from 1891 to 1894 — the time between Holmes's disappearance and possible death in The Adventure of the Final Problem and then the reappearance in "the Adventure of the Adventure of the Empty House—" "as mentioned
 haalanki yah ullekhneey he, ki baad main ek kahani ke 1892 main ghatit hone kaa varnan he
 Conan Doyle wrote the first set of stories over the course of a decade
 Desiring to devote more time to his historical novels, he killed Holmes in "the Final Problem", published in 1893
 Facing eight years of public pressure After doing so, the author wrote The Hound of the Baskervilles, published in 1901, vaguely establishing it before Holmes' "death"
 Although the public was pleased with the story, she was not satisfied with a posthumous Holmes and so Conan Doyle revived Holmes after two years
 kai logon ne doyal dwaara homes ko jivit karne kii manshaa par vichaar kiya, vishesh rup se lekhak-nirdeshak nicholas meyer, jinhone is vishay par "da great main tex a vaak" sheershak se 1970 ke dashak main ek niabandh likhaa

 jo bhi kaaran ho, conan doyal ne ek chauthai sadi tak homes kahaniyaan likhnaa jari rakhaa
 Some authors have given other explanations for the interval
 meyer ke upanyaas da seven-par-saint salution main, antaraal ko gupt vishram diwas ke rup main dikhaaya gaya he jab homes sigmund frid ke haathon se cocaine kii lat kaa ilaaj karwaata he or homes ko prasannchit suzav dete hue prastut kiya he ki watasan yah daawa karte hue ki vah moriarti dwaara maaraa gaya he, ek kaalpanik vivaran prastut karenge or logon ke bare main yah kahenge ki,"ve kisi bhi haalat main tumhaara kabhi vishwaas nahin karenge
" In his memoirs Conan Doyle quotes a reader who declared the earlier stories to be superior to the latter, for the reason that Holmes may have been killed when he went to the Raishenbach falls, rather than ever before
 Not the same
 Holmes's differences between pre and post-interval rather actually led to speculation among those who played "the Great Game"
 In more fictional theories, Mark Bourne's story "the Case of the Detectives Smile" was published in the poetry compilation Sherlock Holmes in Orbit, which estimates that one of the places Holmes visited during his hiatus was Alice's Wonderland
 While living there, he solved a case of stolen samosas and his experiences there contributed to the extermination of his cocaine addiction
