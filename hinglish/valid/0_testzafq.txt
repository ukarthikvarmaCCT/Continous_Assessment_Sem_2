 Traditions in Indian popular cinema are made up of 6 major influences
 pehla; pracheen bhartiya mahakavyon mahabharat or ramayana ne bhartiya cinema ke vichaar or kalpana par gaharaa prabhaav choda he visheshkar kathanak par
 Examples of this effect are the accompanying story, the back story and the technique of story within the story
 In the plot of popular Indian films, the story often spreads to sub-narratives, the plot can be seen in the 1993 film Khalnayak Aur Gardish
 doosraa : pracheen sanskrit naatak, apni shailibaddh swarup or pradarshan par mahatv ke saath sangeet, nrity or bhav bhangima milakar " jeevant kalatmak ikai kaa nirmaan karte hai jahaan nrity or anukaran / swang naatakeey anubhav kaa centre hai"
 Sanskrit plays are also known as Natya
 natya shabd kii utpatti "nrit" shabd mul se hui he jisase sanskrit naatak ke bhavy nrity naatak charitra kaa pataa chalata he jis parampara kaa paalan aaj bhi hindi cinema main ho rahaa he abhinay kii raas vidhi jisaki utpatti pracheen sanskrit naatak ke kaal main hui thi, ek mul gun he jo jo bharitay cinema ko pashchimi cinema se bhinn karata he
 In the Raas Vidhi, the actor exhibits a "sense of empathy" that the viewer feels is in contrast to the Western Stanislavski method where the actor must become the "living awakening avatar" of his character
 " abhinay kii raas paddati lokapriy hindi film abhinayta jaise amitabh bachchan or shahrukh khan or desh bhar main priy film jaise rang de basanti, or antarashtriya str par saraahi gayi satyajit re ke filmo bhi dikhataa he
 Third: The traditional folk Indian theater, which became popular after the fall of Sanskrit drama in the 10th century
 in kshetreey prathaon main bengal kii jatra, uttar pradesh kii ram lila, karnataka kaa yakshagan, andhra pradesh kaa chindu naatakam, or tamilnadu kaa terukkutu he
 Fourth: Parsi theater, which presents realism and fantasy, music and dance, plot and performance, ground dialogue and a mastery of stage performances, all of them together in a dramatic address by Atinatak
 parsi naatakon main bhonda hasya, madhur gane or sangeet, sansanikhej or chakachaundh stage kala hoti he
 "all these effects are evident in the masala films made by filmmakers like Manmohan Desai in the 1970s and 1980s
 iskaa udahaaran hai kuli or haal hi main samikshakon dwaara prashansit rang de basanti 
 Fifth: Hollywood in the 1920s to 1950s when musical films were popular there, though Indian filmmakers differed from their Hollywood counterparts in many ways
 udahaaran ke liye hollywood kii sangitamay film kaa plat adhiktar manoranjan kii duniya main hi hota tha jabaki bhartiya filmkaar lokapriy filmo main fantasy ke tatwon ko badhaate hue geet-sangeet or nrity ko kai paristhitiyon main abhivyakti kaa ek prakritik madhyam kii tarah istemaal karte the
 Mythology, history, fairy tale etc
 along with song and dance is an Indian tradition
 iske atirikt "jahaan hollywood ke filmkaar apni filmo ko nirmit swarup ko chhipaane kii koshish karte hai taaki yathartwaadee kathanak puri tarah se pradhan rahe, bhartiya filmkaar is tathy ko chupaane kii koshish nahin karte kii screen par dikhaaya gaya drishy ek kriti, ek maaya, ek kalpana he
 But he mixed his work with people's daily life in interesting and complex ways
 " ek or prabhaav pashchimi mujeec video hai jinka 1990 ke baad se kaaphi prabhaav padaa he jise nrity kram, camera angel, gati or sangeet meme bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 An early example of this is Mani Ratnam's' Bombay
 lokapriy bhartiya cinema kii tarah bhartiya samaantar cinema par bhi bhartiya theatre or bhartiya sahitya kaa prabhaav padaa he lekin antarrashtriya prerana ke rup main us par european cinema khaas taur par italian navayathartwaad or french kaavyatmak yathartwaad) kaa hollywood ke mukaable zyaada asar padaa he
 Satyajit Ray has called the Italian film filmmaker Vittorio de Sica's Bicycle Thieves and French filmmaker John Raynor's The River, an inspiration for his debut film Pather Panchali
 re ne apane aap ko european cinema or bengali sahitya ke alaava bhartiya theatre kii parampara khaas taur par shastreey sanskrit naatak kii raas paddati kaa bhi karzdaar mana he
 In Raas, the characters not only feel emotion but also depict the audience in an artistic form and this is the double depiction seen in the Apu trilogy
 
 bimal roy kii do bigha zamin bhi de sika kii bisical thivs se prerit thi or isane bhartiya nayi lahar kaa maarg prashast kiya jo french nayi lahar or japani nayi lahar kaa samakaleen tha

 Today, on the lines of his politics, there is a political aspect called Shiv Sena in Nepal and India
 shivaji maharaj kaa janm 19 farvari 1630 main shivneri durg main hua tha
 Shivaji Maharaj was born on 19 February 1630 in Shivneri fort with the womb of Jijabai, wife of Shahji Bhonsle
 shivneri kaa durg puna se uttar kii taraf junnar nagar ke paas tha
 His childhood was spent under the guidance of his mother Jijau Maa Saheb
 vah sabhi kalaon main maahir the, unhone bachapan main raajnneeti evam yuddh kii shiksha lee thi
 These belonged to the Bhonsle sub-caste who were originally from the Kshatriya Maratha caste
 gagabhatta ke anusaar shivaji kaa vansh mewar ke prasiddh guhil sisodiya vansh se miltaa he
 It is due to Shivaji that the entire Maratha community has got the status of being a Kshatriya
 unke pita apratim shoorveer the or unki duusari patni tukabai mohite thim
 His mother Jijabai Jadhav was an extraordinary genius born in the clan and his father was a powerful feudal
 shivaji maharaj ke charitra par mata-pita kaa bahut prabhaav padaa
 Right from childhood, he began to understand the atmosphere and events of that era
 shaasha varg kii karatuuton par ve jhallaate the or baichaiyn ho jate the
 The flame of freedom was ignited in his child's heart
 unhone kuch swamibhakt saathiyon kaa sanghathan kiya
 As the situation progressed, his resolve to break the shackles of foreign rule became stronger
 chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kaa vivaah san 14 may 1640 main saibai nimbalkar ke saath laal mahal, puna main hua tha
 At that time the kingdom of Bijapur was going through a period of mutual struggle and foreign invasion
 aise samrajya ke sultan kii seva karne ke badale unhone maawalon ko bijapur ke kilaaf sangathit karne lage
 Maval Pradesh is connected to the Western Ghats and is some 150 km long and 30 km wide
 ve sangharmpurn jivan vyateet karne ke kaaran kushal yoddha maane jate hai
 Marathas and people of all castes live in this region
 shivaji maharaj in sabhi jati ke logon ko lekar maawalon naam dekar sabhi ko sangathit kiya or unase sampark kar unke pradesh se parichit ho gaye the
 He had started the construction of the fort by bringing Maval youths
 maawalon kaa sahyog shivaji maharaj ke liye baad main utana hi mahatvapurn sabit hua jitna shershah suri ke liye afagaanon kaa saath
 At that time Bijapur was troubled by mutual struggle and Mughal invasion
 bijapur ke sultan adilshaah ne bahut se durgon se apni sena hataakar unhen sthaneey shaskaon yaa samanton ke haath saunp diya tha
 When Adilshah fell ill, anarchy spread in Bijapur and Shivaji Maharaj took advantage of the opportunity and decided to enter Bijapur
 shivaji maharaj ne iske baad ke dinon main bijapur ke durgon par adhikaar karne kii niti apanaai
 The first fort was the fort of Toran
 torana kaa durg puna ke dakshin pashchim main 30 kilometre kii duuri par tha
 Shivaji sent his envoy to Sultan Adilshah and informed him that he was ready to pay better money than the first fortress and handed over this area to him
 unhone adilshaah ke darbariyon ko pehle hi rishwat dekar apane paksh main kar liya tha or apane darbariyon kii salaah ke mutabik adilshaah ne shivaji maharaj ko us durg kaa adhipati bana diya
 Shivaji Maharaj got the work done to repair the deficiencies of the fort with the property found in that fort
 isse koi 10 kilometre dur rajgad kaa durg tha or shivaji maharaj ne is durg par bhi adhikaar kar liya
 When Adilshah got the idea of shivaji Maharaj's policy of expanding this empire, he was upset
 usne shahji raaje ko apane putr ko niyantran main rakhane ko kaha
 Shivaji Maharaj, regardless of his father, took over the management of his father's territory in his hands and stopped regular renting
 rajgad ke baad unhone chaakan ke durg par adhikaar kar liya or uske baad kondana ke durg par
 While taking possession of Kondana, he had to bribe
 usake baad aurangzeb ne mirzaraja jaisingh ko bhejkar 23 kilon par kabja kiya baad main shiji maharaj ke mawala tanaji malusre ne kondhana durg par kabja kiya par us yuddh main vah viragati ko praapt hua uski yaad main kondana par adhikaar karne ke baad uskaa naam singhgarh rakhaa gaya
 Shahaji Raje was given the title of Poona and Soupa and the fortress of Soupa was in the hands of his relative Baji Mohite
 shivaji maharaj ne raat ke samay soopa ke durg par akraman karke durg par adhikaar kar liya or baaji mohite ko shahji raaje ke paas karnataka bhej diya
 Some part of his army also came in the service of Shivaji Maharaj
 isi samay purandar ke kiledaar kii mrityu ho gai or kile ke uttaradhikaar ke liye uske teenon beton main ladaai chhid gai
 Shivaji Maharaj reached Purandar on the invitation of two brothers and, taking recourse to diplomacy, he imprisoned all the brothers
 is tarah purandar ke kile par bhi unka adhikaar sthapit ho gaya
 In the event so far, Shivaji Maharaj did not have to do any war or bloodshed
 1647 isvi tak ve chaakan se lekar nira tak ke bhubhag ke bhi adhipati ban chuke the
 With his increased military power, Shivaji Maharaj planned to enter the plains
 ek ashwarohi sena kaa gathan kar shivaji maharaj ne aabaaji sonder ke netritv main konkan ke viruddh ek sena bheji
 Abaji captured nine other fortifications including Konkan
 iske alaava taala, mosmala or raiti ke durg bhi shivaji maharaj ke adheen aa gaye the
 All the property looted was kept safe in Raigad
 kalyaan ke governor ko mukt kar shivaji maharaj ne kolaba kii ore rukh kiya or yahan ke pramukhon ko videshiyon ke kilaaf yuddh ke liye uksaaya
 Sultan of Bijapur was already in a rage before Shivaji Maharaj's antics
 usne shivaji maharaj ke pita ko bandi banane kaa aadesh de diya
 Shahaji Raje was in Karnataka at the time and was taken prisoner by a treacherous assistant Baji Ghorpade and brought to Bijapur
 un par yah bhi aarope lagaaya gaya ki unhone qutubashah kii seva praapt karne kii koshish kii thi jo golconda kaa shaasha tha or is kaaran adilshaah kaa shatru
 After the mediation of two chieftains of Bijapur, Shahaji Maharaj was freed on the condition that he would control Shivaji Maharaj
 agle chaar varshon tak shivaji maharaj ne bijipur ke kilaaf koi akraman nahin kiya
 During this time he organized his army
 shahji kii mukti kii sharton ke mutabik shivaji rajane bijapur ke kshetron par akraman to nahin kiya par unhone dakshin-pashchim main apni shakti badhaane kii cheshtaa kii
 But in this order the state of Javali was acting as a hindrance
 yah rajya satara ke sudur uttar pashchim main vama or krishna nadi ke bich main sthit tha
 The king here was Chandrarao More, who received this manor from Shivaji
 shivaji ne more shaasha chandrarav ko swaraj main shamil hone ko kaha par chandrarav bijapur ke sultan ke saath mil gaya
 In 1656, Shivaji attacked Javali with his army
 chandrarav more or uske donon putron ne shivaji ke saath ladaai kii par ant main ve bandi bana liye gaye par chandrarav bhaag gaya
 The local people opposed this act of Shivaji but they succeeded in crushing the rebellion
 isse shivaji ko us durg main sangrahit aath vanshon kii sampatti mil gai
 Apart from this, many Maval soldiers Murarabaji Deshpande also joined Shivaji's army
 shivaji ke bijapur tathaa mughal donon shatru the
 At that time, Shahzada Aurangzeb was the Subedar of Deccan
 isi samay 1 navambar 1656 ko bijapur ke sultan adilshaah kii mrityu ho gai jiske baad bijapur main araajaktaa kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya
 Taking advantage of this situation, Aurangzeb invaded Bijapur and Shivaji attacked him instead of supporting Aurangzeb
 unki sena ne junnar nagar par akraman kar dher sari sampatti ke saath 200 ghode lut liye
 Apart from 700 horses, four elephants from Ahmednagar, they looted the fort of Gunda and Resin
 iske parinamswaroop aurangzeb shivaji se khafaa ho gaya or maitri vaarta samaapt ho gai
 On the orders of Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb made a treaty with Bijapur and at the same time Shah Jahan fell ill
 uske vyaadhigrast hote hi aurangzeb uttar bharat chalaa gaya or vahaan shahjahan ko kaid karne ke baad mughal samrajya kaa shah ban gaya
 Knowing the absence of Aurangzeb in South India and the political situation in Bijapur, Shivaji asked Samarji to attack Janjira
 par zanjeera ke siddiyon ke saath unki ladaai kai dinon tak chali
 After this Shivaji himself invaded Janjira and took control of South Konkan and collected annual tax from the Portuguese of Daman
 kalyaan tathaa bhiwandi par adhikaar karne ke baad vahaan nausainik adda bana liya
 By this time, Shivaji had become the owner of 40 fortifications
 idhar aurangzeb ke agra laut jane ke baad bijapur ke sultan ne bhi raahat kii saans lee
 Now Shivaji was the most powerful enemy of Bijapur
 shahji ko pehle hi apane putr ko niyantran main rakhane ko kaha gaya tha par shahji ne isamen apni asamarthta jaahir kii
 The Sultan of Bijapur sent Abdullah Bhatari against Shivaji to deal with Shivaji
 afajal ne 12 xxrep 4 0 sainikon ke saath 1659 main kooch kiya
 Destroying the temples of Tuljapur, he came to Shiraval, 30 km north of Satara
 par shivaji pratapgarh ke durg par hi rahe
 Afzal Khan sent his envoy Krishnaji Bhaskar for a treaty
 usne uske marfat ye sandesh bhijwaya ki agar shivaji bijapur kii adheenta sweekaar kar le to sultan use un sabhi kshetron kaa adhikaar de denge jo shivaji ke niyantran main hai
 At the same time, Shivaji will receive an honored position in the court of Bijapur
 haalanki shivaji ke mantri or salaahkaar as sandhi ke paksh main the par shivaji ko ye vaarta raas nahin ai
 He gave proper respect to Krishnaji Bhaskar and placed it in his court and sent his messenger Gopinath to Afzal Khan to take stock of the situation
 gopinath or krishnaji bhaskar se shivaji ko aisa laga ki sandhi kaa shadyantra rachakar afjal khan shivaji ko bandi bananaa chahta he
 Therefore, he sent a valuable gift to Afzal Khan in exchange for war and thus persuaded Afzal Khan to negotiate
 sandhi sthal par donon ne apane sainik ghaat lagaakar rakhe the milane ke sthaan par jab donon mili tab afjal khan ne apane katyar se shivaji pe waar kiya bachaav main shivaji ne afjal khan ko apane vastron vaghankho se maar diya 
 After the death of Afzal Khan, Shivaji took control of the fort of Panhala
 iske baad pavangadh or vasantgarh ke durgon par adhikaar karne ke saath hi saath unhone rustam khan ke akraman ko vifal bhi kiya
 With this they also captured Rajapur and Dawul
 ab bijapur main aatank kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya or vahaan ke samanton ne aapasi matbhed bhulaakar shivaji par akraman karne kaa nishchay kiya
 On 2 October 1665, the Bijapuri army captured the Panhala fort
 shivaji sankat main funs chuke the par raatri ke andhkaar kaa laabh uthaakar ve bhaagane main safal rahe
 The Sultan of Bijapur, taking command himself, withdrew his authority over Panhala, Pawangarh, looted Rajapur and killed the head of Shringargarh
 isi samay karnataka main siddijohar ke vidroh ke kaaran bijapur ke sultan ne shivaji ke saath samjhauta kar liya
 Shivaji's father Shahaji acted as a mediator in this treaty
 san 1662 main hui is sandhi ke anusaar shivaji ko bijapur ke sultan dwaara swatantra shaasha kii manyata mili
 According to this treaty, the area ranging from Kalyan in the north to Ponda in the south and from Indapur in the east to Davul in the west came under Shivaji's control

 After the end of the race to become king in North India, Aurangzeb's attention shifted to the south
 wo shivaji kii badhati prabhutaa se parichit tha or usne shivaji par niyantran rakhane ke udyeshy se apane mamaa shysta khan ko dakshin kaa soobedaar niyukt kiya
 Shaiska Khan took 1,50,000 fos and took control of the fort of Supan and Chakan and reached Poona
 usne 3 saal tak mawal main lutmar ki
 One night Shivaji attacked him with his 350 Mavalos
 shysta to khidki ke raste batch nikalne main kaamyaab rahaa par use isi kram main apni chaar anguliyon se haath dhonaa padaa
 The sons of Shaista Khan, and forty guards and countless soldiers were slaughtered
 is ghatana ke baad aurangzeb ne shysta ko dakkan ke badale bengal kaa soobedaar bana diya or shahjada muajjam shysta kii jagah lene bheja gaya
 This victory increased Shivaji's reputation
 6 saal shaista khan ne apni 15 xxrep 4 0 fuj lekar raja shivaji kaa pura mulukh jalaakar tabah kar diya tha
 Therefore, Shivaji started looting in the Mughal territories to recover his damages

 It was a prosperous city and its port was very important

 According to this treaty in June 1665, Shivaji will give 23 fortifications to the Mughals and thus only 12 fort will be left with him
 in 23 durgon se hone vaali aamadani 4 lakh hun salanaa thi
 The areas of Balaghat and Konkan will be given to Shivaji, but he will have to pay 40 lakh Huns in 13 installments in return

 Shivaji himself will be free from being in Aurangzeb's court, but his son Shambhaji will have to fight in the Mughal court
 bijapur ke kilaaf shivaji mughalon kaa saath denge
 Shivaji was called to Agra where he felt that he was not getting proper respect
 iske kilaaf unhone apana rosh bhare darbar main dikhaaya or aurangzeb par vishwasghaat kaa aarope lagaaya
 Aurangzeb was angered by this and he saw Shivaji being detained and guarded by 5000 soldiers
 kuch hi dinon baad raja shivaji ko maar daalane kaa iraadaa aurangzeb kaa tha
 But both Shivaji and Sambhaji, with their courage and courage, managed to escape from it
 sambhaaji ko mathura main ek vishwasi brahman ke yahan chhod shivaji maharaj banaras, gayi, puri hote hue sakushal rajgad pahunch gaye 
 This gave the Marathas a new life
 aurangzeb ne jaisingh par shaq karke uski hatya vish dekar karvaa daali
 Shivaji signed a second treaty with the Mughals in 1668 after Jaswant Singh took the initiative
 aurangzeb ne shivaji ko raja kii manyata di

 jab duuton ne sandesh diya to kaashi ke brahamn kaaphi prasann huye
 kintu mughal sainiko ko yah baat pataa chal gai tab un brahmano ko pakad liya
 parantu yukti purvak un brahmanon ne mughal sannico ke samaksh un duuton se kaha ki shivaji koun he ham nahin jaanate he

 ham to tirth yatra par ja rahe hai or kashika koi anya brahman bhi rajbhishek nahin karegaa jab tak raja kaa purna parichay na ho at: aap waapas ja sakate hai
 mughal sardaar ne khush hoke brahmano ko chod diya or duto ko pakad kar aurangzeb ke paas dilli bhejne kii sochi par wo bhi chup ke se nikal bhaage
 waapas laut kar unhone ye baat balaji aav tathaa shivaji ko bataai
 parantu aashcharya janak rup se do din baad vahi brahman apane shishyon ke saath raigarh pahuchen ore shivaji kaa rajbhishek kiya

 So that people do not even consider it !! But they did not work

 khel siddhant kootnithik paristhitiyon main vyavhaar ko boojhne kaa prayaas karata he
 While it was initially developed to understand competitions in which one person benefits from the other's mistakes, it has been extended to many situations where different actions have an impact on each other
 Ho
 aaj, "game theory" samaaj vigyaan ke taarkik paksh ke liye ek chhatari yaa 'uniphoid field' theory kii tarah he jisamen 'saamaajik' kii vyakhya maanav ke saath-saath duusare khilaadiyon ko sammilit kar kii jaati he
 Traditional applications of game theory attempt to find similarities in these games
 samyavastha main game kaa prayek khilaadi ek niti apanaataa he jo vah sambhawatah nahin badalata he
 Many concepts of equilibrium have been developed to understand this idea
 samyavastha ke in avadharanaon kii abhiprerana alag-alag hoti he or is baat par nirbhar karti he ki ve kis kshetra main prayog kii ja raheen hai, haalaanki unke myne kuch had tak ek duusare main mili-jule hote hai or mail khate hai
 This method is not critical and debates continue over the suitability of particular concepts of equilibrium, the appropriateness of societies, and generally the utility of mathematical models
 haalaanki iske pehle hi is kshetra main kuch vikaas chuke the, game theory kaa kshetra jon won neumann or auskar morganstern kii 1944 kii pustak theory of games and iconomik biheviar ke saath aastitiv main aayaa
 This theory was largely developed by many scholars in the 1950s
 baad main game theory spashtatya 1970 ke dashak main jeev vigyaan main prayukt kiya gaya, haalaanki aisa 1930 ke dashak main hi shuru ho chukaa tha
 Game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields
 aath game theorists arthshaastra main nobel puraskaar jeet chuke hai or jon menard smith ko game theory ke jeev vigyaan main prayog ke liye krafurd puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 Games observed in game theory are clearly defined mathematical 'objects'
 ek game khilaadiyon ke ek set, khilaadiyon ke paas uplabdh chaalon ke ek set or nitiyon ke prayek sangyojan ke laabh ke nirdhaaran se bana hota he
 Most 'cooperative games' are represented in special function forms, while the Extensive and Normal forms are used to define nonoperative games
 ekstensive form kaa prayog kuch mahatvapurn anukram vaale gemon ko 'formalaise' karne main kiya ja saktaa he
 Games in this are often represented as 'trees', with each vertex indicating a point of choice for a player
 khilaadi 'vartex' dwaara soochibaddh ek sankhya dwaara nirdisht kiya jaataa he
 The lines that exit the vertex represent a possible action of that player
 laabh tree ke nichle hisse main nirdisht kiye jate hai
 The game depicted here featured two players
 khilaadi 1 pehle chaal chalata he or yaa to f yaa u chunata he
 Player 2 sees the move of player 1 and then chooses either a or R
 maane ki khilaadi 1 u chunata he or phir khilaadi 2 a chunata he, tab khilaadi 1, 8 paata he or khilaadi 2, paata he 
 Extensive form, games in which both moves do not go together and games in which information is not confirmed, can also explain these two types of games
 ise nirupit karne ke liye vibhinn vartexon ko- unhen ek hi soochna set kaa hissaa dikhaane ke liye - yaa to ek bindidaar rekha se joda jaataa he, yaa unke darmyaan ek band rekha khinchi jaati he
 Normal is usually represented by a matrix in which players, moves and gains are marked
 aam taur par yah kisi aise function ke dwaara nirupit kiya ja saktaa he jo prayek khilaadi ke chaalon ke sabhi sanyojanon ke laabh se sambaddh rahata he
 The accompanying example has two players; Selects one row and the other column
 Each player has two strategies specified by the number of rows and columns
 laabh andar main die gaye hai
 The first number is the gain received by the player with the cry; The second number is the profit received by the player with the column
 maane ki agar khilaadi 1 upar chalata he khilaadi 2 baayen chalata he
 Then player 1 gains 4 and player 2 gains 3
 jab ek khel narmal form main prastut kiya jaataa he, yah mana jaataa he ki prayek khilaadi ek saath chaal chalate hai yaa kam se kam duusare ke chaalon se anbhigya hote hai
 If players have any idea of each other's choices, the game is usually presented in extensible form
 hastantaraneey upyogita vaale 'kooparative' gemon main koi bhi swatantra alag laabh nahin die rahete hai
 Instead, the characteristic function determines the gain for each alliance
 maanak dharna yah he ki khaali gathbandhan ko 0 laabh praapt hota he
 The earliest source of this form comes from the foundational book of von Neumann and Morgenstern
 unhone coalishnal normal form gemon kaa adhyayan karte samay yah mana ki jab ek gathbandhan c { \ displaystyle C} c banataa he, yah sampoorak gathbandhan ke viruddh kheltaa he jaise ki wo 2 khilaadiyon vaala game khel rahe hon
 The equilibrium gain of c { \ displaystyle C} c is characteristic
 ab normal form gemon se coalishnal maan nikaalane ke liye vibhinn model hai, par kairactaristic form ke saare game normal form gemon se vyuttpann nahin kiye ja sakate
 As a rule, a characteristic function form game is represented as a pair { \ displaystyle} where n { \ displaystyle N} expresses a set of players and v: 2 n ⟶ r { \ displaystyle v: 2 ^ { N} \ longrightarrow \ mathbb {R}} is a characteristic function
 kairactaristic function form bina hastantaraneey upyogita ke anumargan vaale gemon main samanyikrut kiya gaya he
 The characteristic function form ignores possible 'externalities' of the formation of 'coalescence'
 partishan function form main 'coalishan' kaa laabh sirf iske sadasyon par hi nirbhar nahin karata balki is par bhi nirbhar karata he ki baaki khilaadi kis rup main vibhajit hai
 Game theory has been used in a detailed study of the diverse behaviors of humans and animals
 shuru main yah arthshaastra main aarthik vyavhaar ke ek bade sangrah ko samajhane ke liye viksit kiya gaya tha, jinamein companiyon, bazaaron or upbhogem theory ke vyavhaar shaamil hai
 The use of game theory in the social sciences has expanded further, and game theory has also been used in the study of political, social and psychological behaviors
 game theory aadhaarit vishleshan kaa upyog shuru main 1930 ke dashak main ronaald fisher ne pashuon ke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karne ke liye kiya tha 
 This work dates back to the existence of the name "game theory", but many of the features of it and game theory are similar
 arthshaastra main hue iske vikaas kaa baad main jeev vigyaan main prayogjon menard smith ne apni pustak evolution and da theory of games main kiya
 In addition to predicting and explaining behavior, game theory has also been used to attempt to develop theories of moral or normative behavior
 arthshaastra or darshanashastra main, vidwaanon ne game theory ko achche yaa uchit vyavhaar ko samajhane main bhi prayukt kiya he
 If we go back, we can see that Plato also presented this kind of connotation based on game theory
 raajnneeti vigyaan main game theory kaa prayog nishpaksh vibhaajan, ]]] ke ativyapee kshetron par kendrit he
 In each of these areas, researchers have developed game theory-based models in which players are often voters, states, special interest groups, and politicians
 raajnneeti vigyaan main prayukt game theory ke aarambhik udaahranon ke liye anthony douns kaa kaary dekhen
 In his book An Economic Theory of Democracies: Harvard citations / core, he used the 'hoteling firm location model' in the political system
 downsian model main, raajnneetik ummidavaar siddhanton ke prati ek aiami niti 'spes' main patibaddh hote hai
 Theorists demonstrate how political candidates will converge towards the preferred ideology of average voters

 a game-theoretic explanation of democratic peace is that the public and free debate of democracy transmit clear and reliable information concerning their intentions to other states

 Thus there will be mistrust and reluctance to grant concessions if at least one of the parties in question is a non-democratic mold: Harvard citations / core
 arthshaastri bahut lambey samay se game theory kaa prayog nilaamiyon, mol-bhav, dwayadhikaron, nyaaypurna vibhaajan, alpaadhikaron, saamaajik network ke nirmaan or matdaan tantron sahit aarthik tathyon kii vyapak shreniyon ke vishaleshan ke liye karte rahe hai
 This research usually focuses on specific sets of strategies, called balance in sports
 ye “samaadhaan avadharanayen” saamanytah taarkikta ke niyamon kii aavashyaktaaon par aadhaarit hoti hai
 Among non-cooperative games, Nash equilibrium is the most famous of these
 ranneetiyon kaa ek samucchy yadi anya ranneetiyon ke prati sarvshereshth pratikriya kaa pratinidhitiv karata ho, to vah naish santulan he
 So if all players are making their moves in Nash equilibrium, there will be no unilateral temptation to move away from the path between them, since their strategy is the best, so they can do what the other players are doing
 khilaadiyon kii vyaktigem theory upyogita kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye saamanytah khel ke munaafe ko liya jaataa he
 In ideal situations, profits often represent wealth, possibly related to a person's utility
 haalaanki yah dharna trutipurna ho sakati he
 a paradigmatic paper on game theory in economics begins by presenting a game that is an abbreviation for a specific economic situation
 ek yaa ek se adhik samaadhaan avadharanayen chuni jaati hai or lekhak yah pradarshit karata he ki prastut khel main ranneeti ke koun-se samucchy upyukt prakaar ke santulan main hai
 Naturally, we may wonder what to use this information for
 arthshaastri or vyapaarik professor do praathmik upyogon kaa suzav dete hai: varnanaatmak or aadeshaatmak
 The first known use is to describe how the human population behaves
 kuch vidwaan maanate hai ki khelon ke santulanon kii khoj kar lene par ve is baat kaa purvanumaan kar sakate hai ki jis khel kaa adhyayan kiya ja rahaa he, usamen varnit sthitiyon jaisi sthitiyon se saamana hone par vaastavik maanav aabaadi kis prakaar kaa vyavhaar karegi
 This specific approach to game theory is facing the latest criticism
 sabase pehle, isaki aalochana is baat ko lekar kii jaati he ki game theorycaron dwaara banaai gai dharanaon kaa aksar ulanghan hota he
 Game theorists may assume that players always work in the same way to directly increase their victories to the maximum level, but in practice, human nature often differs from this model
 is tathy kii anek vyakhyaayen hai: tarkheenata, vivechna ke naye model, yaa yahan tak ki vibhinn prerak 
 In response, game theorists compare their assumptions with those used in physics
 is prakaar haalaanki unki dharanayen sadaiv sahi sabit nahin hotin, lekin ve game theory ko bhautik-shastriyon dwaara prayukt pratimaanon ke samaan vaigyanik adarsh ke rup main prayog kar sakate hai
 However, some additional criticism is also leveled at the use of this game theory as some studies have demonstrated that individuals do not use balance strategies
 udhaaharan ke liye shatpad khel main, ek ausat khel kaa 2 / 3 bhaag anumaan par aadhaarit hota he or taanashaah khel main log niyamit rup se naish santulanon ke dwaara nahin khelte
 The debate over the importance of these studies continues
 vaikalpik rup se, kuch lekhak daawa karte hai ki naish santulan maanav aabaadiyon ke liye purvanumaan nahin pradaan karte, balki ve is baat kii vyakhya karte hai ki naish santulanon se khilne vaali aabaadiyaan us avasthaa main hi kyon bani rahati hai
 However, the question remains open how populations reach that point
 apni chintaaon ke samaadhaan ke liye kuch siddhantkaar vikasvaadi game theory kii ore mud gayi hai
 These paradigms either assume no rationality for players or assume restricted rationality
 apane naam ke baavjood vikasvaadi game theory aavashyak rup se jaivik arth main prakritik chayan ko nahin maanata
 Evolutionary game theory encompasses both biological as well as cultural development and the paradigm of individual game theory education
 duusari ore, kuch vidwaan game theory ko manushyon ke vyavhaar ke liye ek bhavishyasuchak upkaran ke rup main nahin, balki is baat ke ek suzav ke rup main dekhte hai ki logon ko kis prakaar kaa vyavhaar karnaa chaiye
 Since a Nash equilibrium of a game produces the individual's best response to other players' game theory methods, it seems appropriate to play a trick that is part of the Nash equilibrium
 haalaanki, game theory ke liye yah prayog bhi aalochana ke antargem theory aa gaya he
 First, in some cases it is appropriate to use a non-equilibrium strategy when the individual is expected to use a non-equilibrium strategy by other players as well
 ek udhaaharan ke liye, ausat kaa 2 / 3 anumaan dekhen
 Second, the prisoner's dilemma presents another possible counter-example
 kaidi kaa asamanjas main, apane swaarth kii purti kaa prayaas karte hue prayek khilaadi donon khilaadiyon ko usase buree sthiti main le aata he, jisamen ve apane swaarth kii purti kaa prayaas na karne par rahe hote
 In contrast to economics, the benefits for sports in biology are often explained in terms of merit
 iske atirikt taarkikta ke vichaar se sambandhit santulanon par kam or vikasvaadi shaktiyon dwaara banaaye rakhe ja sakane vaale santulanon par zyaada dhyaan kendrit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The best equilibrium known in biology is known as the evolutionary static strategy and was first presented in
 haalaanki isaki praarambhik prerana main naish santulan kii koi bhi maansik aavashyaktaa shaamil nahin thi, lekin prayek ESS ek naish santulan hota he
 Game theory has been used to understand many different facts in biology
 sabase pehle iskaa upyog 1:1 ling anupaat kii utpatti kii vyakhya karne ke liye kiya gaya tha
 Suggested that the 1: 1 sex ratio is the result of evolutionary forces acting on individuals who can be seen as attempting to increase the number of their grandchildren to the maximum level
 iske atirikt, jeev-vigyaniyon ne vikasvaadi game theory or ESS kaa upyog pashuon ke bich sampreshan ke aavirbhaav kii vyakhya karne ke liye kiya he
 Analysis of signaling games and other communication games has provided some information about the origin of communication between animals
 udhaaharan ke liye, pashuon kii anek prajatiyon, jinamein shikari jaanwaron kii ek badi sankhya kisi bade parabhakshi par hamalaa karti he, main samuhik akraman kaa vyavhaar sahaj rup se utpann sanghathan kaa ek udhaaharan prathit hota he
 Biologists have used the game of chicks to analyze territoriality and fighting behavior
 khelon kii utpatti or siddhant kii prastaavna main menard smith likhte hai, “rodhabhasi rup se, yah paaya gaya he ki game theory arthshaastreey vyavhaar ke kshetra, jiske liye vah mul rup se banaaya gaya tha, kii bajaay jeevigyaan par zyaada acchhee tarah lagu hota he”
 Evolutionary game theory has been used to explain many of the facts that seem to be Asangem Theory in nature
 aise hi ek tathy ko jaivik paropkaarita kehete hai
 This is a situation in which an organism appears to be acting in such a manner, which is beneficial to other organisms and detrimental to itself
 yah paropkaarita kii paaramparik dharna se bhinn he, kyonki aise kaary sachetan nahin hote, balki sakal yogyata ko badhaane ke liye vikasvaadi anukulan ke rup main dikhaai dete hai
 Examples of this include vampire bats, who spew blood from night prey and pass it on to members of their group who have failed to hunt, from worker bees, who serve the lifelong queen bee, and sometimes Do not mingle, ranging from vervet monkeys, who warn group members about the hunter's arrival, even if it threatens their own lives Are
 inamen se sabhi kaary ek samooh kii sakal yogyata ko badhaate hai, lekin aisa karne ke liye ek jeev ko apni jaan ganvaani padati he
 Evolutionary game theory describes this altruism as the idea of relative selection
 paropkaaree jeev un praaniyon ke bich bhed-bhav karte hai, jinaki ve sahaayta karte hai or ve apane sambandhiyon kaa paksh lete hai
 Hamilton's law explains the evolutionary logic behind this selection by the formula c <b * r, where the logistic theory applied to a philanthropist must be less than the product of the coefficient of profit and affiliation
 do jeevon ke bich nikatataa jitani adhik hogi, paropkaarita kii ghatnayen bhi utani hi bad jaaengi kyonki unke anek genetic tatv samaan honge
 This means that the philanthropic organism may abandon the option of giving birth to one's own offspring, ensuring that the genetic elements of its close relatives are transmitted further
 
 udaahranarth, kisi sahodar kii sahaayta karne kaa gunank 1 / 2 hota he kyonki jeev apane sahodar kii santan main 1 / 2 genetic tatv saajha karata he
 Ensuring that a substantial number of siblings survive to adulthood eliminates the need for a philanthropist to produce his or her own
 gunank maan khel ke maidan ke daayre par atyadhik ashrith hote hai: udaahranarth, jinke prati pakshpaat karnaa he, unke chunaav main yadi sabhi genetic jivit vasteen, keval sambandhi nahin, shaamil hon, to ham maanate hai ki sabhi manushyon ke bich antar khel ke maidan main vividhta kaa lagbhag 1% hota he, jo gunank ek chote kshetra main 1 / 2 tha, vah 0
995 ho jaataa he
 Similarly, if it is considered that any information other than genetic information remains with time, then the playing field becomes bigger and the discrimination becomes smaller
 tark or computer vigyaan main game theory ek badhati hui mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane laga he
 Many logical principles have their basis in game economics
 iske atirikt, computer vaigyanikon ne anek antahkriyaatmak gananaaon kaa nirmaan karne ke liye khelon kaa prayog kiya he
 Also, game theory provides a theoretical basis in the field of multi-agent mechanisms
 pruthak rup se, game theory ne online elgorithm main bhi bhoomika nibhaai he
 Typically, the k-server problem, which in the past was referred to as mobile games and request-response games
 saanchaa:harvard citations / core yaao kaa siddhant yadruchhikrut elgorithm or visheshtah online elgorithm, kii gananaatmak jatilta kii nichali simaaon ko siddh karne ke liye ek khel-saidhantik takanic he
 The field of algorithmic game theory combines computer science concepts of complexity and algorithm design with game theory and economic theory

 Game theory has many uses in philosophy
 saanchaa:harvard citations / core dwaara prastut do shodh-patron par pratikriya dete hue, Lewis ne sammelan kii ek darshanik samaj viksit karne ke liye game theory kaa prayog kiya
 In doing so, he provided a preliminary analysis of general knowledge and used it to analyze sports in synergy sports
 iske atirikt, pehle unhone yah suzav diya ki vyakti arth ko sanket khelon ke sandarbh main samaj saktaa he
 This suggestion has been used by many philosophers after Lewis, (harvard citations / core)
 Following the game-theoretic Lewis of conventions, Ullmann Margellit and Bicherry have developed theories of social rules that form the Nash equilibria that result from converting a mixed-purpose game into a synergy game
 Let's define
 game theory darshanikon ko antahkriyaatmak gyanamimasaa ke sambandh main sochane kii chunauti bhi detaa he: kisi samooh ke liye samaan vishwaason yaa gyaan kaa kya arth hota he or abhikartaaon kii antahkriya ke kaaran milanevaale saamaajik parinaamon par is gyaan kaa kya prabhaav padataa hai
 Philosophers working in this field include Bicherry, Skirmes, and Stalnaker

 Other authors have attempted to use evolutionary game theory to explain the emergence of human attitudes towards morality and the behavior of animals in this regard

 Some of the predictions used in parts of game theory have been challenged in philosophy; Psychological egoism states that rationality reduces self-interest — a claim that is a matter of debate for philosophers
 ek khel sahakaari hota he, yadi khilaadi bandhankaree patibaddhtaon kaa nirmaan kar paane main sakasham hon
 For example, the legal system makes it necessary for them to follow their word
 gaiyr-sahakaari khelon main yah sambhav nahin hota
 It is often believed that communication between players is allowed in cooperative games, but not in non-cooperative games
 yah vargeekaran do dwiadhari kasautiyon ke aadhaar par asweekaar kar diya gaya he
 Of the two types of games, non-cooperative games are capable of performing situations to the best of detail and produce accurate results
 sahakaari khel vyapak rup se khel par kendrit hote hai
 Significant efforts have been made to connect these two routes
 tathakthith naish-program ne pehle hi anek sahakaari sthitiyon ko gaiyr-sahakaari santulanon ke rup main sthapit kar diya he
 Hybridized games have cooperative and non-cooperative elements
 udhaaharan ke liye sahakaari khelon main khilaadiyon ke gathbandhan banaaye jate hai, lekin ve ek gaiyr-sahakaari style main khelte hai
 a symmetrical game is a game in which the benefit of playing according to a specific strategy depends only on the other strategies used, not on those who play them
 yadi ranneetiyon se milanevaale munaafe ko badale bina khilaadiyon kii pahchaan badali ja sakati ho, to khel samamit hota he
 Many of the commonly studied 2 × 2 games are symmetric
 chikan, qaidi kaa asamanjas or barasinghe kaa shikaar ke maanak pradarshan sabhi samamit khel hai
 Some scholars may consider various asymmetric games as examples of these games
 haalaanki inamen se prayek khel ke liye sarvaadhik prachlit laabh samamit hote hai
 The most studied asymmetric games are those games that do not have the same set of strategies for both players
 udhaaharan ke liye, altimet game or dictator game main prayek khilaadi ke liye bhinn ranneetiyaan hoti hai
 However, it is also possible that a game has the same strategies for both players and is still asymmetric
 udhaaharan ke liye, donon khilaadiyon ke liye ranneetiyon ke samaan samucchy hone ke baavjood bhi dahini ore chitrit khel asamamit he
 Zero-sum games are special examples of steady-sum games, in which selections made by players neither increase nor decrease the available resources
 shunya-raashi khelon main, ranneetiyon ke prayek sangyojan ke liye, khel ke sabhi khilaadiyon ko milanevaale kul laabh kaa yogafal shunya hota he 
 The game of poker represents an example of a zero-sum game because any player wins the same amount of money as his opponent loses
 anya shunya-raashi khelon main sikkon kaa milan or go tathaa shatranj sahit adhikansh shastreey board khel shaamil hai
 Most of the games that have been studied by game theorists are non-zero-sum games because some of those receipts have gross results greater or less than zero
 anaupchaarik rup se, gaiyr-shunya-raashi khelon main, kisi ek khilaadi ko milanevaala laabh aavashyak taur par kisi anya khilaadi ko hone vaali haani se judaa nahin hota
 Fixed-sum games are related to game theory methods such as theft and gambling, but not to the fundamental economic situation in which the profits from the trade are probable
 ek atirikt nakli khilaadi, jisaki haniyaan khilaadi ke shuddh laabh kii kshatipurti karti hai, ko jodakar kisi bhi khel ko ek shunya-raashi khel main roopantarit kar paanaa sambhav hota he
 Simultaneous games are games in which both players play their moves together, or if they do not move simultaneously, the latter are ignorant of the moves of the first players
 aanukramik khel aise khel hote hai, jinamein baad main khilne vaale khilaadiyon ko purvavarti chaalon kii kuch jaankaree hoti he
 It is not necessarily complete knowledge of each game theory method of preceding players; This can be very little information
 udhaaharan ke liye, sambhav he ki koi khilaadi yah jaanata ho ki kisi purvavarti khilaadi ne koi vishisht chaal nahin chali thi, jabaki vah yah na jaanata ho ki pehle khilaadi ne anya uplabdh chaalon main se vastutah koun-si chaal chali thi
 The main differences between synchronous and sequential games are included in the various performances discussed above
 aksar, samakalik khelon ko darshane ke liye saamaanya rup kaa or aanukramik khelon ko darshane ke liye vistrut rup kaa prayog kiya jaataa he; haalaanki, takneekee rup se yah koi sakht niyam nahin he
 An important subset of sequential games consists of complete information
 ek khel purna jaankaree se yukt hota he, yadi sabhi khilaadi anya khilaadiyon dwaara pehle chali gai chaalon ke bare main jaanate hon
 Thus, only sequential games can be complete information because in synchronous games each player does not know the moves of other players
 game theory main adhyayan kiye jane vaale adhikansh khel apurna-jaankaree vaale khel hote hai, haalaanki, altimet game or shatpad khel sahit purna-jaankaree vaale khelon ke kuch rochak udhaaharan uplabdh hai
 Full-fledged games include chess, go, mankala and arima
 purna jaankaree ko aksar samast jaankaree samaj liya jaataa he, jo ek sadrush avadharana he
 For all the information, each player is required to know the strategies and realizations of other players, but it is not necessary to have knowledge of their game theory methods
 arthshaastriyon or vaastavik-vishwa ke khilaadiyon dwaara adhyayan kiye jane vaale khel saamanytah chaalon kii simit sankhya main samaapt ho jate hai
 Pure mathematicians are not as constrained, and set theorists typically study games that persist for an unlimited number of moves, and the winner in them is not known until after the completion of all those moves
 saamanytah dhyaan is baat par zyaada kendrit nahin hota ki aise khelon ko khilne kii sarvshereshth vidhi kya he, balki keval is par hota he ki kya kisi khilaadi ke paas jeetne kii ranneeti he
 
 nipunata se rachit khelon ke liye varnanaatmak samucchy siddhant main aisi ranneetiyon ke astitv ke mahatvapurn prabhaav hote hai
 The majority of game theory relates to limited, discrete games, with limited number of players, moves, events, results, etc
 haalaanki anek avadharanaen vistaarit kii ja sakati hai
 Continuous games allow their players to select a strategy from a continuous strategy set
 udhaaharan ke liye, cornt pratiyogita kii rachana vishisht rup se is prakaar kii gai he ki khilaadiyon kii ranneetiyaan koi gaiyr-nakaaratmak matraaen, bhinnaatmak matraaon sahit, hoti hai
 Inferior games, such as the Continuous Pursuit and Evasion games, are continuous games
 vyaktigem theory nirnay samasyaon ko kabhi-kabhi "ek-khilaadi vaale khel" mana jaataa he
 Although these conditions are not game theoretic, they are constructed using several of the same tools as the Ingem Theory of Decision Theory rules
 keval do yaa do se adhik khilaadiyon ke hone par hi koi samasya khel saidhantik banati he
 Often a random player is added, who performs "opportunistic moves", also known as "natural moves"
 do-khilaadiyon vaale kisi khel main is khilaadi ko teesraa khilaadi nahin mana jaataa, balki khel main jahaan aavashyak ho, vahaan vah keval paase kii bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Games with an unlimited number of players are often called n-person games
 ye ve khel hai jinhen khelnaa kisi anya khel, lakshya yaa vishay khel, ke liye niyamon kaa vikaas karnaa hota he
 Metakhels try to increase the utility value of a set of rules developed to the maximum level

 The first known discussion of game theory occurred in 1713 in a letter written by James Waldegrave
 is patr main waldegrev taash ke khel le har ke do-vyaktiyon vaale sanskaran ke samaadhaan ke liye ek minimax mishrit siddhant pradaan karte hai
 James Madison produced what we now know to be a game-theoretic analysis of how the differential theory states of different mechanisms of taxation can be expected to behave
 antony augustin cornt dwaara 1838 main Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses kaa prakaashan kiye jane tak kisi saamaanya khel saidhantik vishleshan kaa anusaran nahin kiya jaataa tha
 In this work Cornett considers a duopoly and presents a solution, which is a limited version of the Nash equilibrium
 haalaanki cornt kaa vishleshan waldegrev ke vishleshan se adhik saamaanya he, lekin jon won newman dwaara 1928 main shodh-patron kii ek shrunkhlaa kaa prakaashan kiye jane se purv tak ek adwitiya kshetra ke rup main game theory kaa vastutah koi astitv nahin tha
 Although the French mathematician Emily Borel did some preliminary work on the games, von Neumann can reasonably be credited with being the inventor of the game theory
 won newman ek budhimaan ganitagya the, jinka kaary samucchy siddhant se lekar unki gananaaon, jo anu va hydrogen bamon donon ke vikaas kii kunjee thim or antat sanganakon ke vikaas ke unke kaary tak vyapak rup se faila hua tha
 Von Neumann's work in game theory reached its peak in 1944 in Von Neumann and Oscar Morgenstam's book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior
 is gahan kaary main do-vyaktiyon vaale shunya-raashi khelon ke liye paraspar sangem theory samaadhaanon kii khoj karne hetu vidhiyaan shaamil hai
 During this time period, work on game theory was primarily focused on cooperative game theory, which analyzes optimal strategies for a group of individuals, assuming they can enforce consensus among themselves about appropriate strategies
 1950 main, qaidi kaa asamanjas prakat hua or RAND corporation main is khel par ek prayog kiya gaya
 Around this time, John Nash developed a criterion for interrelated theory of player strategies, known as the Nash equilibrium, and a broader range of games than the one proposed by von Neumann and Morgenstheim
 Applies to the category
 yah santulan paryaapt rup se itnaa saamaanya he ki yah sahakaari khelon ke atirikt gaiyr-sahakaari khelon ke vishleshan kii anumati bhi detaa he
 Game theory experienced a stir of game theory methods in the 1950s, during which time the concepts of original, in-depth games, fantasy games, repeated games, and Shaple Mann developed
 iske atirikt, isi samay ke dauraan darshanashastra or raajnneeti vigyaan main game theory ko pehali baar lagu kiya gaya
 In 1965, Reinhard Selton introduced his solution concept of suboptimal equilibria, which further refined the Nash equilibrium

 1970 ke dashak main, mukhyatah jon menard smith or unki vikasvaadi rup se sthir ranneeti ke kaary ke falswaroop game theory ko jeevigyaan main gahan rup se lagu kiya gaya
 Additionally the concepts of correlated balance, trembling hand experience and common sense were presented and analyzed
 2005 main, game theorycaron thomas shelling or robert oman ne nobel vijetaon ke rup main naish, celton or harsenyi kaa anusaran kiya
 Schelling worked on game theory developmental paradigms, an early example of evolutionary game theory

 Parashuram ji was pleased and told Bagdalia Muni that you know that i am well-versed in destroying the Kshatriyas but i have asked for the womb of this woman, so now i will not kill it, but no Kshatriya can survive me
 For this reason, when the pregnancy of this woman is over, then this child will be given the dynasty of Chitragupta and give it Kayastha religion

 Scotland's National Monument is an unfinished structure located near the Nelson Monument on Calton Hill in Edinburgh, Scotland, as a memorial to the Scottish soldiers killed in the Napoleonic Wars
 calton pahari ke upar sthit is smarak kii sanrachana ko 1823-26 ke bich charles rabart kukarel or williabh henry plafare dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 It was to be built on the lines of the Parthenon of Athens as planned
 isi silsile main 1826 main shuru hue nirmaankarya ko 1829 main nidhi ke abhaav ke kaaran band karnaa padaa
 Due to its unfortunate history, it is often addressed by the inadequate or stigma of Scotland and Edinburgh, and the pride and poverty of Scotland and many other surnames
 nepolian yudhon mein maare gaye skotian sainikon ke sammaan main ek smarak kii maang pehali baar 1816 main hi hyland socity of scotland dwaara kar di gai thi
 According to the primary plan, Edinburgh's The Mound was chosen to build the monument, which was later rejected in favor of the Calton Hill

 yah model arthvyavastha ke pramukh bazaaron me hone vaale len-dein ko aarthik agenton ke bich ke paise ev maal or sevaaon ke pravaah ke rup main daarshata he
 In a closed circuit the flow of exchange of money and goods is shown, in which the flow of two economic chords runs in the opposite direction
 paripatr pravaah vishleshan rashtriya khaaton kii, or isliye, macroiconomics kaa aadhaar he
 The idea of circular flow was already in the works of Richard Cantillon
 franswa kyusane ne yah model viksit kiya jisaki jhaanki "économique" main maujuud tha
 In the second part of Karl Marx's "fertility Plans," Kussena's ideas are further elaborated
 iske abhinn bhaag he - raajnneetik arthvyavastha kii aalochana, jon menard keens kii "general theory", byaaj or paisa, aadi
 Circular flow of income is a key concept for better understanding of the economy
 yah ek saadhaaran arthvyavastha ko darshata he jo keval vyavsaay or vyaktiyon se sclit he or ek "paripatr pravaah aarekh" samajha ja saktaa he
 Businesses here come under "business sector" and "domestic sector"
 is saral arthvyavastha main, gharelu kshetra se shram pradaan kiya jaataa he jo kii kaarobaar vastuon or sevaaon ke utpaadan ko sakasham banaata he
 In return for this labor, the domestic sector receives wages from the business sector
 duusari ore, vyapaar kshetra se gharelu kshetra ke liye maal or sevaayen pradaan kii jaati he jisse vyapaar kshetra kii aay ho jaati he
 The circular flow diagram shows the interdependence between the production of goods and services in the economy and the income generated from this production
 paripatr pravaah "utpaadan se arjeet aay" or "maal or utpaadan sevaaon ke mulya" ke bich samanta ko bhi dikhaati he
 The overall economy is much more complex than it is estimated
 ek arthvyavastha na keval vyaktiyon or vyavsaayon, apitu sangheey, rajya or sthaneey sarkaron or duniya ke baaki hisson ke nivaasiyon ke bich ke aarthik gatividhiyon ke aadan-pradaan ke bare me bhi he
 Also this simple example of the economy does not show other aspects of economic activity such as capital investment, financial capital, and the contribution of these flows to the accumulation of fixed assets
 paripatr pravaah kii sabase paurvik vichaaron main se ek, 18- veen sadi ke irish -french arthshaastri richard cantilon kaam main samajhaayaa gaya tha, jo inase pehle ke arthshaastriyon jaise wiliam pati ke kaamo se prerit tha
 Cantillon describes this concept in his 1730 essay— "essay on the Nature of Trades in Generals", lessons 11–13
 arthshaastri tharnton, cantilon ke vichaaron ko sahamati dete he or kahte he ki- "in the circular flow model of Cantillon, agricultural production is distributed among property owners, farmers and laborers
 haalanki sampatti maalikon "swatantra" hai, yah model sabhi virgon ke bich kii aapasi nirbharta ko darshata he, jise adam smith ne apane kaam - "da theori off moral centiments", main "adrishy haath" qaraar diya he
 Cantillon has described at least five types of economic agents: property owners, farmers, entrepreneurs, laborers and artisans - as shown in their circular flow diagram
 kyusane ne aage in avadharanaon ko or viksit kiya
 He first illustrated this concept in his "tableau économique"
 unka maananaa tha ki vyapaar or udyog dhan ke strot nahin the
 Agricultural surpluses in the form of rent, rent, salary, and purchases were the real economic movers
 iske do kaaran he - 1) Regulation of income flow across all social classes, impedes and as a result, hinders economic development
 2) utpaadak varg jaise kisaanon par se kar hataaya janaa chahie ev anurvar varg jaise jameendaaron par adhik kar lagu karne chaiye kaaran unke jivan kaa shandaar tareeke aay pravaah ko vikrut karte he
 Kuesne's model includes three economic agents - the "proprietary" class includes only landowners, the "productive" class includes all agricultural laborers, and the "unproductive" class is made up of artisans and merchants
 in teen virgon ke bich utpaadan or aay kaa pravaah malikana varg ke saath shuru hota he kyoki ve jameen ke maalik he, or ve anya donon virgon se kharidte he
 Economic reproduction, in Marxist economics, refers to the iterative processes by which the prerequisites for early economic activities are continually recreated
 aarthik prajnan main bhautik utpaadan or maal or sevaaon ke vitaran, vastuon or sevaaon kaa "trade", or maal or sevaaon kii khapat shaamil he
 Marx developed the original insights of Cusne's "model of capital, money, and the circulation of goods"
 unhone apni kitaab "das capital" ke duusare shraini main yah dikhaaya ke prajnan prakriya ek poonjivadi samaaj me paiso ke sanchalan ke madhyam se kaise chal saktaa he
 Marx distinguishes between "simple reproduction" and "extension reproduction"
 "saral prajnan" main koi aarthik vruddhi nahi hoti he or "vistaar prajnan" main arthvyavastha ko banaae rakhane ke liye jitna aavashyak he usase adhik utpaadan kiya jaataa he jis vajah se aarthik vikaas sambhav hota he
 The difference is that in the first type the surplus is used by the owner for consumption expenditure and in the second type, the surplus is reinvested in the production process
 jon menard keens kii 1933 me prakashit "da jeneral theori off emploement, intrest and mani" paripatr pravaah siddhant main ek mahatvapurn vikaas tha
 Keynes's assistant Richard Stone further developed the concept which is now used internationally
 1933 main frank nite ne apane "da iconomik organizeshan" main aadhunik aay ke paripatr pravaah model kii sarvapratham kalpana kii
 In the basic circular flow of income, or the equilibrium state in the circular flow of the two-sector income model, there is a situation in which there is no change in the level of income, expenditure and production
 arthath: y = i = o iskaa matlab yah he ki kharidaaron ke vyay vikritaon ke liye aay ban jaataa he
 The seller then spends this income on factors of production such as labor, capital and purchasing raw materials so that these cars can be produced further
 is prakaar kaarak maalikon ko apni aay pahucha dete he
 The causative owner here is the domestic sector
 kaarak maalikon is aay ko punah jo maal or utpaadan sevaao me kharch karte hai, jo vyapaar kshetra me banati he, or isi tarah yah aay ek paripatr pravaah kii tarah bahata he
 This basic circular flow of income model has six assumptions: 1) gharelu kshetra or vyapaar kshetra : arthvyavastha ke do hi kshetra hai
 2) Families spend their income in consumption of goods and services
 isamen koi bachat he
 3) All the issues produced by the companies are bought by the families through their expenditure
 4) isamen koi vittiya kshetra nahin he
 5) There is no government sector in it
 6) vahaan koi videshi kshetra nahin he
 It has three areas - domestic sector, business sector and government sector
 yah aay ke paripatr pravaah kaa adhyayan inhi kshetron main karegaa, duniya ke baaki hisson ko chhodkar, arthath band arthvyavastha me
 The flow of money here comes in the form of taxes from the domestic sector and business sector to the government sector
 sarkari kshetra se praapt aay vyapaar or gharelu kshetra ko jaati he vastuon or sevaaon kii sarkari kharidari ke bhugtan or utre or hastantaran bhugtan ke rup main
 Every payment is a receipt of it, which keeps the expenditure of an economy equal to the total income and makes this circular flow endless
 ek aadhunik maudrik arthvyavastha me yah chaar kshetra shaamil hai: 1) Domestic Sector 2) vyapaar kshetra 3) Government Sector 4) baaki duniya kshetra Each of the above areas receives some payment in lieu of goods and services from the other three regions
 "paiso" ko sucharu rup se is tarah ke aadan-pradaan kii suvidha sambhav hoti he
 The residual savings of each of these four sectors comes from the capital market which has invested in companies and the public sector
 takneekee taur par, jab tak rin or udhaar me barabari he, paripatr pravaah jari rahegaa
 This work is done by the financial institutions of the economy
 paanch sector model main arthvyavastha paanch sectoron main baanta gaya he: 1) Domestic Sector 2) vyapaar kshetra 3) Financial sector: Banks and non-bank intermediaries who borrow and lend 4) sarkari kshetra: sthaneey, rajya or sangheey sarkaron kii aarthik gatividhiyaan 5) Rest of the world: Changes the model from an open economy to a closed economy paanch sector model arthvyavastha kaa ek adhik yathartwaadee pratinidhitiv he
 Unlike the two-sector model, where there are six assumptions, the five-sector circular flow cancels all six assumptions
 chunki pehali dharna ko rad kiya gaya he, teen or kshetra shaamil kiye gaye he
 In the five-sector model of the economy there is "leakage" and "injection"
 ->jab gharelu kshetra or vyapaar kshetra apane aay kaa hissaa sahejte hai, yah saheja hua hissaa "likaij" kehalaata he
 This is in the form of savings, tax payments, and imports
 licage aay kaa pravaah kam karti he
 -> "injection" adds proceeds to the flow
 jab gharelu kshetra or vyapaar kshetra bachat udhaar le, ve "injection" kehalaate hai
 Injections increase the flow of income
 yah injection nivesh, sarkari kharch or kaa niryaat ke rup main hote hai
 The circular flow of income will continue indefinitely as long as the extract and injection are the same
 vittiya sansthaaon yaa puunji bazaar bichauliyon kii bhoomika nibhaate hai
 This means that the income earned by individuals and the goods and services sold to them are not called injections or leakages, because no money is being introduced into the flow and no money is being taken out of the flow
 is
 likaij or injection ke vittiya kshetra, sarkari kshetra or videshi kshetra main ho saktaa he
 1) "real" flow is the exchange of goods and services between the domestic sector and the business sector whereas "money" flow is the exchange of money between two sectors
 2) real flo ke antargat gharelu kshetra vyapaar kshetra ko kachche maal, bhoomi, shram or puunji dete he jiske badale vyapaar kshetra gharelu kshetra ko taiyaar maal or sevaayen pradaan karata he
 Under money flow, the business sector pays the domestic sector the wages and wages, rent, interest etc
 paripatr pravaah ke teen charan - utpaadan, upbhog vyay or aay kii sristi hai
 These three are the endless basic economic activities of an economy
 utpaadan aay ko janm detaa he, aay vastuon or sevaaon ke liye maang ko janm detaa he, aisi maang vyay ko janm detaa he or vyay adhik utpaadan ke liye prarna banataa he
 This entire process forms the basis for the circular flow of income

 dakshin-purv asia ke itihaas main mandal ek akendrit rajjya vyavastha thi
 The circle literally means 'circle'
 mandal siddhanth vartmaan yug ke ekikrut raajnneetik shakti ke vipareet rajshakti kaa model he
 Kautilya has described the policy adopted by various states towards other states in his board theory
 pracheen kaal main bharat main anek chote-chote rajyon kaa astitv tha
 Powerful kings expanded their empire by war
 rajya kai baar suraksha kii drushti se anya rajyon main samjhauta bhi karte the
 According to Kautilya, a king who expanded his empire through war and victory should increase the number of friends in comparison to his enemies, so that enemies could be kept under control
 duusari ore nirbal rajyon ko shaktishaalee padosi rajyon se satark rahanaa chahie
 They should form a group or a 'mandal' to avoid expansionary policy of powerful states in association with states of equal status
 kautilya kaa mandal siddhant bhugolic aadhaar par yah darshata he ki kis prakaar vijay kii ichha rakhane vaale rajya ke padosi desh uske mitra yaa shatru ho sakate hai
 According to this theory, there is a king in the center of the mandal, who is willing to win other states, it is called "vijigishu"
 ‘‘vijigeeshu’’ ke maarg main aane vaala sabase pehla rajya ‘‘ari’’ tathaa shatru se laga hua rajya ‘‘shatru kaa shatru’’ hota he, atah vah vijigeeshu kaa mitra hota he
 Kautilya has also described "moderate" and "indifferent" states, which, despite being powerful, do not participate in the strategy
 kautilya kaa yah siddhant yatharthwaad par aadhaarit he, jo yudhon ko anterrashtriya sambandhon kii vaastaviktaa maanakar sandhi va samjhaute dwaara shakti-santulan banane par bal detaa he
 In fact, it is a source of inspiration for today's foreign policy
 aatankwaad ek prakaar ke maahaul ko kaha jaataa he
 It is defined as a type of violent activity, which also targets the security of non-military, ie civilians, to reimburse their economic, religious, political and ideological goals
 gaiyr-rajya karkon dwaara kiye gaye raajnneetik, vaicharik yaa dharmik hinsa ko bhi aatankwaad kii shrenee kaa hi samajha jaataa he
 Now, illegal violence and war have also been included under this

 It is often criticized for inappropriate comparisons of terrorism with Islamic or jihadist, ignoring non-islamic organizations or personalities
 aatankwaad shabd kii utpatti aatank shabd se hui he
 Terrorism is such actions which are done to spread some kind of terror
 aise kaary karne waalon ko aatankwaadi kehete hai
 There are also many forms of terrorism
 The term unconventional warfare and psychological warfare is taken politically and emotionally and this very compounds the difficulty of providing an accurate definition
 a 1988 study by the US Army found that the top 100 definitions of the term "terrorism" Has been used found
 
ek vyakti jo prathaon aatankwaad se ek he aatankwaadi
 Terrorism has been used by a broad range of political organizations in furthering their objectives; Both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalist and religious groups, revolutionaries and ruling governments
 The presence of non-state actors in widespread armed conflict has been made in relation to the application of dispute laws of war

 Refers to vahaan aatankwaad kii paribhaasha par asahmati he
 However, there is an intellectual consensus globally, that acts of terrorism should not be accepted under any circumstances

 "terrorism" was the term used in the earlier context of state terror during the French Revolution
 yadi shaantikaal main ek lokapriy sarkaar ke aadhaar gun he ", kranti ke ek baar main apana aadhaar gun or aatank he - gun he, jo bina aatank barbar ho jayega; or aatank he, jo bina gun napunsak hoga
"
 a 1988 study by the United States Army found that more than one hundred definitions of this word were used and existed
 kai deshon main aatankwaad ke krityon ko kanoonee rup se aapraadhik krity anya prayojanon ke liye kiya se he or "aatankwaad" pratishthit hai kaanoon dwaara paribhaashit he, dekhnaa aatankwaad kii paribhaasha vishesh paribhaashaayen ke liye
 General principles between the legal definition of terrorism and also encouraging cooperation between law enforcement personnel in different countries provide an emerging consensus as to meaning
 in paribhaashaon main vahaan yah he ki sambhaavna kii pahchaan nahin kar kai hai hinsa ke vaid kaa upyog karen nagarikon ek akraman ke khilaaf ek main dwaara kabja desh, or is prakaar sabhi label hoga pratirodh andolan s aatankwaadi samoohon ke rup main

 Ultimately, there is a difference in political decisions
 is navambar 2004 main, ek sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad report main kisi bhi adhinium "maut yaa nagarikon yaa gaiyr karne ke liye gambhir shaareerik nuksaan nahin pahunchaa karne ke liye icchit-ladaakon karne ke liye ek aabaadi yaa sammohak ek sarkaar yaa ek antarrashtriya sanghathan ko daraana yaa kisi bhi kaary karne se bachanaa ke uddeshy ke saath aatankwaad ke rup main varnit he
 "
) The US Department of Defense defines terrorism as:" use reckoning to arouse fear of illegal violence or threat of illegal violence, or to force targets into pursuit that are generally political Governments or societies intimidate, religious or ideological
 " aadhikarik paribhaashaayen counter kaa nirdhaaran aatankwaad kii niti or aksar viksit kar rahe hai use seva karne ke liye
 Most government definitions outline the following key criteria: the goal, purpose, culprit and the legality or legitimacy of the act
 Terrorism is also often identified due to one subsequent statement from perpetrators
 hinsa - walter Laqueur ne ke anusaar kendra samrik or antarrashtriya adhyayan ke liye, aatankwaad kaa "keval saamaanya lakshan aam taur par sahmati he ki aatankwaad hinsa or hinsa ke khatre shaamil he
 "terrorism alone does not, however, form the test of violence alone, creating a useful definition: war, riot, organized crime, or even a simple assault

 Failure to make this change so badly that it is seen as a result worse than the death of citizens is desired
 yah aksar hota he, jahaan aapasi ke bich aatankwaad or dharm hota he
 When a political conflict is integrated into one or "religious cosmic framework" the conflict, such as over control of a ancestral homeland or holy site like Israel and Jerusalem, becomes equated with a failed spiritual failure in the political goal
 Which, for the extremely committed, is worse than one's own death or death of innocent citizens

 For a long time, victims of terrorism are not targeted because they are threats, but because they tie specific "symbols, devices, animals or corrupt creatures" to a particular view of the world that the terrorist said to be officers 
 unke peedit dar instilling ke aatankwaadiyon 'lakshya, ek darshak, yaa anyathaa unke aksar kattarpanthi dharmik or raajnneetik samaapt hota he accomplishing karne ke liye ek sandesh baahar nikal rahaa accomplishes

 According to David Rodin, the Utilitarian philosopher has observed that in some accidents, the event of conscience is less considered in front of good deeds, it is thought that Utilitarians who do not cause terrorism in the world, i do not know why the end of small claims Names earn, but they bear the ill effects that some of the terrorists come to the non-useful philosophers, Michael Walzer's argument of terrorism Is always morally wrong but at the same time those who are engaged in terrorism may be morally justified in a specific case: when "a race or community is in extreme danger of complete destruction and it can defend itself a The only way in the face is deliberately targeting non-combatants, so it is morally entitled to do so

 Former United Nations secretary-general Kofi Annan has said that it is "time to set aside the debate over alleged state terrorism"
 The use of force by these states is already fully regulated under international law "however, he also Said that, "


 regardless of the difference between governments on the question of the definition of terrorism, what is clear and what we can all agree on made clear innocent citizens Not any attack on, " State terrorism has been used by government agents or forces to refer to terrorist incidents
