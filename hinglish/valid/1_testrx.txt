 There are also some drawbacks of active filters

 There is a correlation in the life, size, shape, surface composition and color of birds
 usee prakaar ek thok yaa samooh ke antargat andon kii sankhya or kisi ritu main thokon kii sankhya main ek sambandh hota he
 The measurement of an egg depends mainly on the dealings of the egg laying bird, but it is not necessary that the ratio is always the same
 iske do kaaran hai : The size of the hen's egg is often the same size as the eggs of other birds
 anda ek disha main lanbaa hota he or uskaa ek chor golakaar or doosraa chor thodaa nukila hota he
 The eggs do not roll easily because they are round at one end and pointed at the other end
 saath saath andon ke nukile bhaag ghonsle ke madhya main kendrit ho jane or unka golakaar bhaag baahar kii ore hone se, yadi ghonsle main teen chaar andey hon to ve sabhi aasaani se ant jate hai

 Some sparrows have smooth surfaces, some have shiny, some have very polished and some have rough and rough
 andon kaa rang bhi bhinn bhinn chidiyon main bhinn-bhinn hota he
 Some sparrows' eggs are white, but some eggs are colored, green, blue, brown, and lacy

 The spots are in the form of spots, or rashes, and are small or excessive
 dhabbe andon kii sataha par samaan rup se bikhare ho sakate hai, athwa kisi bhaag main adhik or kisi bhaag main kam
 Some species of birds have individual differences in the color and markings of eggs of different members within the same caste

 Therefore, the color of eggs given on green branches is green and the color of eggs given on the ground is often brown

 Eggs are found in small rhizomes of some songs from seven to eight to twelve
 shikaar kii kuch chidiyon or batakhon main isse bhi or adhik sankhya pai jaati he
 Most birds, if their eggs are stolen, or destroyed, or they are forced to abandon the eggs, lay eggs again, because every bird has a certain number of eggs
 jab tak yah sankhya puri nahin ho jaati, vah andey dena samaapt nahin karti
 Sparrows usually lay once in a season
 kuch gaanevaali chidiyaan ritukal main do yaa teen baar bhi bachche utpann karti hai
 Sparrows whose eggs and children are more destroyed, or who are young, have a faster reproduction and a greater number of eggs
 chidiyon kii aayu kaa bhi prabhaav unke andon kii sankhya par padataa he
 The first-to-date sparrows lay fewer eggs and the second or third-spawn sparrows lay more eggs
 andon kii sankhya jab puri ho jaati he, tab unka sena prarambh hota hai
 Birds incubate eggs with great dedication, keeping them warm with their wings and protecting them: adhikansh jatiyon main nar or maadaa donon hi andsevan kaa kaary karte hai, bhale hi andey sene kaa kaary ek thodaa karata he to doosraa adhik
 Sometimes the female incubates eggs during the day and the male at night
 kuch jatiyon main keval maadaa hi andey seti hai, kintu aisi avasthaa main nar uske liye bhojan jutata he
 Males and females of any caste continue to come in turn
 anda-seven-kaal main maadaa kaa dhyaan andey sene main kuch aisa lag jaataa he or usamen aisi ekaagratha utpann ho jaati he ki yadi koi uske andey ko hataakar anya koi vastu, jaise pathar ke tukade, rode ityadi, bhi rakh de to vah bina dekhe sune unpar baithkar unhen seti rahegi
 It is often seen that even after the eggs are spoiled or lifeless, the female keeps on incubating them for a long period
 kabutaron main nar bade chaav se anda seta he he
 Not only this, but the female removes herself and sits on the eggs
 nar swayan nahin de saktaa, kintu santanprem kii abhilaashaa se vah kisi tarah maadaa ko rijhaakar joda band letaa he, maadaa se andey dilava letaa he or phir uske baad unke sene tathaa shishupaalan kii sari kriya swayan bade chaav se sampann karata he
 Lapland and Auk species have higher numbers of males, fewer females
 at: sabhi nar joda baandhane main safal nahin ho pate, par unki anda sene tathaa santan paalan kaa abhilaashaa dil se nahin jaati
 In contrast, there are some birds who serve eggs to others rather than themselves
 koyal, papiha aadi inamen mukhya hai, jo chori se apane andey kauwe, charkhi athwa satbhiye aadi ke ghonslon main rakh aate hai or unhen murkh banaakar unase dhatri kaa kaam lete hai
 There are some birds, which neither incubate the eggs themselves nor serve them to others, but cook and protect them from the heat of the sun
 shuturamurg naamak pakshi apni chaati kii ragad se gaddha taiyaar karata he or uske chaaron ore chonch se baaluu rakhkar diwaar si khadi kar letaa he
 Then in this, females, usually 20 to 30, lay eggs
 shaturamurg kii ek hi maadaa nahin hoti, ek nar kii kai patniyaan hoti hai or ye sabhi baari se isamen andey parti jaati hai
 After the laying of the eggs is complete, a small layer of sand is laid on them
 din bhar surya kii kirnon se ye andey garam rahete hai
 In the night, these birds sit on them and provide warmth to them
 kai pakshi aise hai, jo kisi ushn jal ke jharne ke sameep gadhe banaakar unamem andey dete hai, phir unhen dhakkar anyatra chale jate hai
 These eggs keep warm with the hot water of the spring
 samay puraa hone ke din ye lautakar aate hai or upar kii mitti ko hataa dete hai, phir bachche andey phodkar baahar chale aate hai
 Where there is extreme heat, the birds arrange to keep the eggs cold, not warm
 iske liye ve jal main apni chonch bhigo bhigokar unase andon ko bhigote rahete hai, taaki atyadhik taap ke kaaran unhen kshati na pahunche
 Seven times are also different among sparrows

 In some, the intake period is of one month and in others it is less than two weeks

 When the embryo is fully developed, the bird strikes repeatedly with its beak to come out of the egg-like prison and, according to race, in the middle of the egg, or any other wide site, there is a crack and the baby comes out
 Comes
 us samay vah ek taral padaarth se bhigaa hua sa rahata he, jo hawa lagane se sheeghra hi suukh jaataa he
 Children of chicken, pheasant, ostrich etc
 start running as soon as they come out, but babies of parrots, fowls and crows etc
 cannot open their eyes for several days
 ve ek nirih si avasthaa main pade rahete he tathaa hafton tak dhonsle main hi apane shishav ke din bitaate hai
 The first few weeks of the baby bird when coming out of the egg have some special difficulties and dangers
 in dinon vah na keval choti or kamjor hoti hai, balki praaia: swayan bhojan chugane main asamarth tathaa udne se bhi laachaar hoti he
 Infants of different species of birds are born in different conditions and on this basis they can be classified into the following two major categories: nidatyagi shishu kii ankhen janm se hi khuli hoti hai or inkaa sharir mulaayam paron se dhakaa hota he
 They are alert and playful from the beginning and can run or swim
 haan, yadi inhen chhedaa na jaay to janm ke pashchaat kuch ghanton tak ye shant pade rahanaa pasand karenge
 From the very beginning, they begin to feed themselves
 batakh or murgi ke shishu iske achche udhaaharan he
 Among wild birds, babies of tittibhas, hyacinths, ducks and other birds of prey do the same
 shikaar kii chidion main ek or visheshta yah hoti he ki ye sheeghra hi udne bhi lagati hai
 Nesting infants remain in the nest until they grow up after birth and have to depend completely on their parents for food

 jalkaag tathaa bak aise pakshiyon kaa samooh he jinke bachche janmkaal main bilkul nange hote hai, arthath unke sharir par bahut kam par rahete hai
 The bird with which eggs hatch, also nurtures and protects their offspring with the same readiness
 santanraksha main bahudhaa dekha gaya he ki pakshi apane praan kii bhi chintaa nahin karte
 By making various excuses in child protection, these birds also surprise the visitor
 bahudhaa ye use dekhakar is prakaar langadaane lagate hai, maano kisi shikari dwaara ghayal kar die gaye hon
 Enemy hunters, Badikhas, Schwans, Shrigaladi, when they chase them with the hope of catching them, they go out of their way by dodging and then fly away suddenly
 is tarah dushman ko ghonsle se dur le jaakar use pathbhrasht kar dete hai, jisase vah kisi or disha main chal de tathaa need ke shishuon par ai vipadaa is tarah tal jaae
 Sparrows are also very aware of throwing dust in the eyes of others
 jab ve kabhi ghir jaati hai to mritat hokar jameen par let rahati hai, jise dekhanevaala unhen mrit samajhakar aage kii ore bad jaataa he
 Then they leave the ground soon and stand ahead

 Hathadharma, Raddhanta or Dogma means 'fanatical religious belief or mind'
 aarambh main "dogma" sanmati yaa vyavastha aadesh ke arth main prayukt hota tha; peeche isse aisi dhaaran abhipret hone lagi, jise koi vyakti maanata hi nahin, varan us par balpurvak jamaa rahata he, chaahe koi pakshaantar bhi utana hi vishwast kyon na dikhta ho
 Now this word is often used in relation to theology
 dogma aisi dharna he jise kisi sampradaay ke sabhi sadasyon ko maananaa hota he, kyonki yah apane tatv main daivi prakaash he
 This Prakash, when required to do so, formulates an empowered person or a special assembly
 isaayiyon ke liye isa ke kathan, baudhon ke liye buddha ke kathan aise mantavya hai
 They cannot be called theories, because the question of proving them does not arise
 isai sampradaay ke liye pramukh dogma "tritv" kaa swaroop he
 The threesome includes "father", "son" and "holy Spirit" as three independent conscious beings
 teen chetan kaise ek chetan kaa ansh ban sakate hai, yah vivechan kaa vishay nahin, apitu daivi avishkaar he
 In 325-26 AD, the Council of Nice decided that "the element of father and son is the same", "father" is not the producer of the son
 yah bhi nirnit hua ki "pavitraatma' pita or putr donon se paidaa hui he
 In 1545–63, the intentions made in the Assembly of Trent were often still valid for the Roman Catholic denomination
 1870 i0 main rome kii sabha main nishchay kiya gaya ki pope ko bhi adhikaar praapt he ki vah isai mantvyay ko sutarabaddh kar sake
 The Protestant denomination after the apostasy stated that the interpretation of divine light is the right of every Christian
 buddha bhikshu ko dikshit hone ke samay nimnaankit vrath lene hote the -- Jesus and Gautama Buddha said whatever they said
 mohammad ne jo kuch kaha, vah unke vichaar main, ishwariya sandesh tha, jo ek devdoot ne unhen pahunchaaya
 The religion accepted in Islam is called "iman"
 imaan ke saat ansh hai -- In any case the believer believes that "dogma" is true and empowered; This is not an open question

 america main pravasi hindi lekhak
 The flying Spaghetti demon is the god of Pastafari religion
 ise america ke sarkari vidyalayon main intellegent dizine or crieshnism padhaane kaa virodh karne ke liye san 2005 main banaaya gaya tha
 Through this, it is shown that the burden of philosophical proof is on the person who is making a scientifically unjustifiable claim, rather than the person who is rejecting that claim
 haalanki is dharm ke anuyaayi ise ek asli dharm bataate hai, par media main ise ek vyangy dharm kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 The first description of the flying Spaghetti monster is found in a satirical letter written in 2005 by Bobby Henderson to the Board of Education of the State of Kansas, USA
 is chitthee se ve board dwaara vigyaan kii kakshaon main kram-vikaas ke sthaan par intellegent dizine padhaane kii anumati die jane kaa virodh kar rahe the
 In the letter, he satirizes Creationism by asserting his faith in a deity that looks like spaghetti and meatballs and the creator of the universe
 ve tark karte hai ki unki dharanaayen intellegent dizine kii dharanaon ke jitani vaid hai, or kehete hai ki isliye unki dharanaon ko vigyaan kii kakshaon main kram-vikaas or intellegent dizine ke baraabar samay milanaa chahie
 The flying Spaghetti demon is often used as a contemporary adaptation of Russell's teapot due to its popularity and reach
 iske madhyam se ye darshaya jaataa he ki darshanashastriy saboot kaa boj us vyakti par he jo vaigyanik drushti se jhoothaya na ja sakane vaala daawa kar rahaa ho, bajaay us vyakti ke jo us daawey ko asweekaar kar rahaa ho
 Although Henderson states that "the same religion is allowed in Pastafari religion - disallowance of religious beliefs", yet Pastafari people hold some beliefs
 pastafaari srijan myth ke anusaar ek adrishy or anbhigyeya udanevaale spagetti daanav ne bahut zyada sharaab pine ke baad brahmand kii rachana das hajaar varsh pehle kii thi
 According to these beliefs, the reason for the Earth to be flawed is the drunkenness of this demon during creation
 pastafaari ye bhi maanate hai ki kram-vikaas ke sabhi saboot pastafaariyon kii shraddha jaanchane ke liye swayan udanevaale spagetti daanav ne rakhe the
 When scientific measurements, such as radiocarbon dating, are taken, the flying Spaghetti transforms the demon figures so that scientists understand that the Earth is billions of years old
 pastafaari dharm kii swarg kii sankalpana main ek bear jwalamukhi or nagn nartakiyaan banane vaala kaarkaana shaamil he
 
 pastafaari nark bhi aisa hi he, par bear basi he or nartkiyon ko yon sanchaarit rog hai
 According to pastoral beliefs, pirates are in reality celestial beings and original pastoralists
 pastafaari maanate hai ki samudri luteron ke "chor or bahishkrut" hone kii dharna madhyayug main isai dharamshastriyon dwaara or aaj antarrashtriya krishnabhaavnamrita sangh dwaara failaai ja rahi juthi soochna kaa nateeja he
 According to them, in reality the pirates were "peace-loving travelers and disseminators of harmony" who distributed sweets to children
 ye kehete hai ki aaj ke samudri luteron kaa "pracheen jindadil samudri lutrron" se koi sambandh nahin he
 Additionally, Pastafari holds the ghosts of pirates responsible for the mysterious disappearance of marine and airplanes from the Bermuda Triangle
 pastafaari har varsh 19 sitambar ko "samudri luteron kii tarah bolo kaa antarrashtriya diwas" manaate hai
 Atheism · Christianity · Hinduism · Islam · Judaism · Sikhism jolgibi bharat-nepal seemaa par kaali or gori nadiyon ke sangam par sthit ek chota bazaar he
 This name is used for both markets, out of which the market towards Nepal is smaller than the market located towards India
 donon ore ke bazaar ek jhula pul se jude hue hai
 Panchadravida literally means five Dravidians
 arthath paanch vishesh kshetra jo dravidako agrapanktime letaa ho- dravid,karnataka, tailang, gurjar,or maharashtra kintu baad main yah pad un samast ucchkulin brahmanon ke liye prayukt hone laga | skandapuranake anusaar vindhyaachal ke dakshin main multah vaidic varnashramadharmavalamvi janake ek brahman samuh rahete he jinako panchadravid kehete hai| dravidah, karnatakah,telungah, gaurgerah,or maharashtrah ye panchadravid kehalaate the| ye log telugana, andhrapradesh, maharashtra, karnataka or tamilnadu aadi pradeshon main nivas karte the yaa vibhinn kaarnon se apana mul pradesh chhod kar anyatra- khaas taur par uttar bharat main bas gaye
 Brahmins of Gujarat also joined it

 i Gingival overgrowth is a disease of the gums
 isamen masoode kaa aakaar saamaanya se bahut bada ho jaataa he
 Gums are enlarged due to many different reasons
 atah vruddhi kaa vaastavik kaaran samajhnaa or uske anusaar chikitsa karnaa jaruri he
 As mentioned earlier, there may be several reasons for enlargement of the warts
 sabase aam karaan he - masoodon ke jeernsujanaizaaf; jis main masoodon naidanik rup se mulaayam or berang dikhaay dete hai
 This plaque is caused by bacterial exposure to edema by tissues caused by cellular infiltration and is contagious and prolonged with conventional periodontal treatment, such as scaling and root planing
 Conditions in which chronic inflammatory gingival enlargement involves planing to expose fibrotic vital components that do not respond to scaling and root and when undergoing shrinkage is treated with a procedure known as surgical removal of gingivectomy
 More often, tissue
 masoode kii sujan or vruddhi, munh se jo shwaas lete hai, un main aksar dekha jaataa he
 Dehydration is caused by irritation on a surface as a result, but has not been caused the way it has been performed
 masoodon kaa izaafaa, teen vibhinn virgon kii dawaaon se jude jate hai: Many systemic diseases can present oral manifestations - which may include enlargement stage - some are related to specific conditions and some are related to the disease: chaktaa kaa sanchayan or avdhaaran, masoodon ke shothyukt izaafaa ke mukhya kaaran hai
 Risk factors include poor oral hygiene and gingival irritation - due to improper installation and epidermal instrumentation
 dawa prerit izaafaa anuvanshik purvapravriti se ke saath juda jaataa he - or sujan ke saath nahin
 In drug-induced disease, it is easy to stop gum growth - the drug should be discontinued
 However, this is not always an option
 aisi sthiti main, agar sambhav ho, to vaikalpik dawa chikitsa niojit kiya ja saktaa he -paksh prabhaav se bachane ke liek
 pratirakshadaman maamle main, takrolimus sichlosporin ek uplabdh vikalp he
 This causes less gum growth, but is also kidney-toxic
 Dihydropyridine derivative isradipidine may act as nifedipine - for some uses of the calcium channel and it does not produce gums
 yah boxr kutton or anya 'barchhisafalik' naslon or springer spaniel main dekha jaataa he
 yah aamtaur par, madhyam umr ke aasapaas shuru hota he or pragati karte rahata he
 Some areas of gums become quite large; But it is attached only to the small area with the rest of the gums - and it can cover the teeth completely
 masoodon ke sankraman or sujan is dasha main aam he
 Under anesthesia, the scalpel blade can cut off enlarged areas of the gums, but it usually grows again
 masoodon kaa izaafaa masoode kii sujanaki ek sambhavit uttarkatha hota he
 As seen in humans, it can have side effects using cichlosporin

 aditya kashyap, jo ek prasiddh udyogpati kaa betaa he, bahut adhik pareshaan he, ek aisi ladki kii shaadi main bhaag lekar or adhik dukhi ho jaataa he, jo kisi or se pyaar karti he
 He feels ashamed to lose sight of the world, leaves the wedding ceremony and catches a train at night
 train main vah ek sundar, batooni ladki geet dhillon se miltaa he, jo mumbai se apane ghar-bhatinda ja rahi he
 Initially, Aditya is very irritated with the song and every time meeting him is nothing less than a mental torture for him
 vah apane premi anshuman ke saath bhaagane kii apni yojanaon ke bare main use bataati he, saath yah bhi bataati he ki uske mata pita uski is shaadi se raji nahin honge
 Geet makes Aditya so upset that he gets off the train
 geet use train par waapas bulaane kii koshish karti he, isi kashmakash main uski train chhot jaati he or donon ek ujaad se stesan par khadey hote hai, geet kaa saamaan train main chhot jaataa he or uske paas paise bhi nahin hote hai
 Geet tells Aditya that now he has to safely reach his home in Punjab
 donon uttar bhartiya pradeshon se hote hue ek sukhad yatra shuru karte hai, bason, texiyon or oont-gadiyon se ve geet ke ghar pahunch jate hai
 Aditya, who has spent a lot of time with the song, starts feeling positive about life again
 jab ve ghar pahunchate hai, geet ke ghar waalon ko galat fahmi ho jaati hai ki ve donon ek duusare ko pyaar karte hai, lekin ve donon jaldi hi geet ke parivaar ko vishwaas dilaa dete hai ki unke bich aisa kuch nahin he
 Aditya tells Geet's family that he is a musician, he does not want them to recognize him as a famous industrialist and his family accepts this
 kuch dinon baad, geet ke parivaar vaale uske liye ek ladkaa dekhte hai, jo usase shaadi karne ke liye use dekhne aane vaala he
 When the boy comes there, Geet pretends to be in love with Aditya, he sees Geet and Aditya spending some intimate moments together
 baad main us raat, geet manali main anshuman se shaadi karne ke liye aditya ke saath ghar se bhaag jaati he
 However, Geet's sister sees them running away together and tells the whole family about it
 ve jaldi se unhen pakadaney kii koshish karte hai, lekin isse unka shaq sahi sabit ho jaataa he ki ve donon ek duusare se pyaar karte hai
 They both reach Manali and then take their different paths
 geet ke prabhaav ke kaaran, ek nae vishwaas or jivan ke prati ek sakaaratmak drushtikon ke saath aditya mumbai pahunchataa he or apni company ko charam safalataa tak pahunchaa detaa he
 About nine months after he arrives, he launches a new product, a calling card named after "geet"

 Aditya is shocked to hear that Geet has not yet returned home
 vah use dhundne or ghar waapas pahunchane kii jimmedaari letaa he
 Aditya again goes to Manali, where she hopes Geet will be with her new husband, but upon arriving here she learns that Anshuman has refused to marry Geet and sends her back

 He finally finds her in Shimla, a city in the Himalayas, he is shocked to see what the song has become: what a quiet, silent, sad girl who teaches in a school
 vah use in paristhitiyon kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar karata he, vah kisi tarah use mumbai waapas le aata he or chijen phir se us ke paksh main hone lagati hai
 However, Anshuman comes and reveals that he realizes that he has done wrong and tries to improve their relationship again
 shuru main, geet ko nahin lagata ki vah uski maafi ko sweekaar kar legi lekin aditya use aisa karne ke liye kahata he, baavjood iske ki vah khud usase pyaar karne lagata he
 The trio return to Bathinda to tell that Geet and Anshuman want to get married
 bhatinda main phir se parivaar ko aisa lagata he ki geet or aditya ek duusare se pyaar karte hai or is bhram kii sthiti main ve log parivaar kii galatfahami ko dur nahin kar pate hai
 In an attempt to clear up this misunderstanding, Geet realizes that she is really in love with Aditya, not Anshuman and so they get married
 vah apni asuraksha se ladane main itnaa vyast rahata he ki apane jivan kaa anand nahin uthta he, tab geet uske jivan main aati he

 jab ali ne film ke liye casting shuru kii, karina kapur geet dhillon kii bhoomika karne ke liye nirdeshak kii pehali pasand thim or aditya kashyap kii bhoomika ke liye shahid kapur ko liya gaya, ali ne usase mil kar paaya ki abhinayta ek poster ke ladke se kahin adhik he
 On the two lead actors, Ali commented, "I wanted a girl who looked natural when she got off the train, didn't have to do make-up, she had to look like she was very angry, talkative, interesting
" But not annoying
 main kabhi bhi uskaa prashansak nahin tha or maine uske zyada role dekhe bhi nahin hai, lekin mujhe pataa tha ki vah geet ke rup main bilkul thik rahegi, jab main usase mila, mujhe ehsaas hua ki vah bhuulane yogya abhinayta nahin he, vah kai filmon main aa chukaa he
 He has suffered a lot in life and never brought that maturity out

 The "box" was actually a large jar given to Pandora), which contained all the evils of the world
 jab pandora ne jaar ko kholaa, jaar main nihit sabhi saamagree mukt ho gayi, lekin ek-ummid ke liye
 Today, opening Pandora's box means creating evils, which can never be destroyed
 pandora dharti par pehali mahila thi
 Pandora was created at the behest of Zeus, the god of craftsmanship, who ordered Hephaestus to create Pandora
 hefstas ne pani or dharti kaa upyog karte hue use banaaya, jabaki anya bhagavaanon ne use kai uphaar die 
 When Prometheus stole the fire from Mount Olympus, Zeus avenges it by handing over Prometheus' brother, Epimetheus, to Pandora
 isi samay, pandora ko ek jaar diya gaya or use aadesh diya gaya ki vah kisi bhi paristhiti main ise naa khole
is chetavanee ke baavjood, jigyaasa main pandora ne jaar ko khol diya
 In doing so, the evils inherent in it came into the world
 dari hui pandora ne turant jaar ko band kar diya, taaki vah zeeus kii ichha ke anusaar ummid ko usamen band kar de
 In other versions, hope does not come out, although the main purpose of Pandora's myth is to explain why evil exists in the world
 ise purvabhaas bhi mana ja saktaa he jo mukt nahin hua
 Many interpretations of this story ignore the fact that Pandora's box contains all the bad things that will make humanity sick and hope was also inside the box, thus missing the second chapter of the myth
 mul greek shabd jiskaa upyog kiya gaya vah tha, pithos, jo ek bada jaar he, kabhi kabhi itnaa bada jitna ki ek chota manushya se kaha gaya ki isamen ek baar main ek soyegaa)
 It was used for the storage of wine, oil, grain, or other material, or, as a religiously burying human body

 Pithos was mistranslated by Erasmus of the 16th century humanitarian Rotterdam who translated Pandora's Hesiod story into Latin

 The phrase "box of Pandora" has endured ever since

 Modern feminist literary criticism also focuses on the gender symbolism inherent in myth

 Ideally, a caste is formally given a scientific name, although in practice there are many such castes
 a caste is named when it is placed in lineage / lineage
 vaigyanik drushtikon se ise pariklpana mana ja saktaa he ki jatiyaan duusare vansh kii tulana main duusari jatiyon ke jinas se bahut adhik sambandhit hoti hai
 a common cast includes and / is best known as its classification category: life, region, state, caste, class, order, family, clan and caste
 Letting the genus determine it is not invariant; a classification scientist can later give it a different genus, due to which its name will also change
 jaivik namakaran main, kisi jati ke naam ke do bhaag hote hai, ve latin maane jate hai, haalanki kisi bhi mul bhashaa ke naam evam sthaan yaa vyakti ke naam kaa upyog uske liye kiya ja saktaa he

 keval duusare shabd main hi nahin jati ke naam purna rup se dwipadi hai
 This bipartisan naming tradition was later used by Leonhard Fuchs to convert the nomenclature to the biological code, and was released as a standard by the Carolus Linnaeus in the Species Plantarum in 1753

 "jati" shabd kii vyakhya karnaa vismayakari dhang se mushkil he jo sabhi prakritik praaniyon par lagu hota he or jatiyon kii vyakhya kaise karen ke bare main jeev vigyaniyon par lagu hote hai or vaastavik jatiyon kii pahchaan kaise karen ko jati samasya kaha jaataa he
 In most textbooks a race is a "real and potentially inter-breed natural population group" that is set apart as other such breeding groups
 is paribhaasha ke vibhinn bhaagon jaise kuch asaamaanya yaa kritrim samagam isse baahar rakhe gaye hai: The definition in the above ideal textbook works well for multi-cellular animals, but there are some situations where they can be ruled out as inappropriate: kshaitijiya jin sthanantaran shabd "jati" paribhaashit karne ko or bhi jatil bana dete hai
 There is strong evidence of horizontal gene transfer between unequal groups of the prokerat group and, at least often, unequal groups of eukaryates, and Williamson argues that there is some evidence available of this in crustaceans and echinoderms
 "jati" shabd kii sabhi paribhaashaayen ki kisi apane sabhi jin apane ek yaa do mata-pita se praapt hote hai us praani ke bilkul samaan hote hai, laqin aadharchyut jin sthanantaran is anumaan ko galat tehraata he
 One of the best questions is the term "caste" which is being described by zoologists and this discussion is known as the problem of castes
 darwin ne on da orijan of spasis ke adhyay II main likhaa
 But later, Darwin amended his view in The Descent of Man by saying "whether humans consist of one or many castes"
 vikaas kaa aadhunik siddhant "jati" kii nai moolbhoot paribhaashaon par nirbhar he
 Prior to Darwin, naturalists viewed castes as ideal or common types, which can be exemplified with an ideal model that has all the same qualities as a normal race
 darwin ke siddhant kii ekarupata ne dhyaan ko saadhaaran se vishesh kii taraf sthanantarit kar diya
 According to intellectual historian Lewis Meinand, yah "jati" ko nae drushtikon main badal detaa he; darwin In practice, biologists have defined castes as populations of animals that have high levels of genetic similarity
 yah usee jeevakosh ke anukulan ko pratibimbit or anuvaanshik saamagree kaa ek se duusare main sambhavit sadhano kii kismon ko sthanantarit kar sakati he
 The exact level of similarity in this type of definition is used unilaterally, but it is the most common definition used for animals that cause asexual reproduction, such as some plants and micro-organisms
 sookshm jeev vigyaan main kisi bhi spasht jati kii kami kii badhya ne kuch lekhakon ko tark dene ke liye badhya kar diya he ki jeevanu kaa adhyayan karte samay "jati" shabd kaa upyog sahi nahin he
 Instead, they observed genes far-flung related bacteria, bacteria associated with the entire bacterial region, with a gene pool independently
 phir bhi, anguuthe ke niyam kii sthapana yah kehete hue kii gai ki ve ek duusare se 97% se adhik samaan 16S rrna jin kram bacteria yaa orchia kii jaanch DNA-DNA sankaran dwaara kii jaani chahie chahen vah samaan jati se sambandhit hon athwa nahin
 The concept has recently been updated, stating that the 97% threshold was too low and could be increased to 98
7%
 yon rup se paidaa hone vaale jeevon, jahaan par jin sambandhi saamagree ko prajnan sambandhi prakriya main saajha kiya jaataa he, to do praaniyon ke antar janan prakriya or donon lingon ke sankar vansh samaan sanketak ke rup main sweekaar kiye jate hai ki praaniyon ne samaan jati ke sadsy ke rup main prachur jeenon ko apanaaya he
 In a way "caste" is a group of inter-breeding beings
 is paribhaasha ko yah kehete hue aage badhaayaa ja saktaa he ki jati praaniyon kaa vah samooh he jo sambhavit taur se antarjaatiy prajnan karne main sakasham he - machhliyon ko usee jati main rakhaa ja saktaa he bhale hi ve bhinn-bhinn jhiilon main rahati hon kyonki ve antarjaatiy prajnan kar sakati hai yadi ve kabhi bhi ek duusare ke sampark main aayin hon
 duusari ore, teen yaa adhik vicitra aabaadi vaale bahut se udhaaharan hai ki kya bich main aabaadi vaale jantu duusare prakaar kii aabaadi vaale jantuon main antar prajnan kar sakate hai lekin duusari taraf aabaadi vaale ye jantu antar prajnan karne main sakasham nahin hai
 Thus, it is debatable whether these populations constitute one or two different castes
 isamen koi virodhabhas nahin he ki jatiyon ko jin aavritiyon ke aadhaar par paribhaashit kii jaati hai or is prakaar se unki aspasht simaaen hai
 Consequently, the universal definition of "caste" is necessarily unilateral
 iske bajaay, jeev vigyaniyon ne bahut si paribhaashaayen di hai; jiskaa upyog koi jeev vigyaani ke liye paripurna vikalp he, vah us jeev vigyaani ke shodh kii visheshtaon par nirbhar karata he
 In practice, these definitions are similar and their case is more important than the outright contradiction between them
 phir bhi, abhi tak prastaavit jati kii koi bhi avadharana puri tarah se uddeshypurna nahin he yaa kisi nirnay ke liye sahaayta liye bina sabhi maamalon main lagu ho saktaa he
 Given the complexity of life, some say that the definition of such an objective is impossible in all kinds of possibilities and that biologists must determine the most plausible definition
 adhikansh ridh vihin praaniyon main yah sabhi jaivik jatiyon kii avadharana he or filogenetic jati kii avdhaaran main kaaphi had tak kam he
 Many BSC sub-castes are considered castes under the PSC; The difference between BSC and PSC can be determined because the BSC defines race as a result of a clear evolutionary history, whereas PSC defines a race as a result of a clear evolutionary possibility
 is prakaar se, PSC jatiyon ko "banaaya" gaya jaise hi vikasvaadi vansh ko alag kiya janaa shuru hua, jabaki BSC jati ne keval tabhi nikalnaa shuru kiya jab unka vansh kaa algaav purna ho gaya
 Accordingly, substantial controversy between alternative classifications based on PSC vs
 BSC is possible because they are totally different depending on the behavior of their taxa, which would be considered sub-casts under the latter model
 jivan ke samarthan vaali jatiyaan: kai jatiyaan paryaavaran ke anukulan ke prati bilkul vicitra hoti hai, kyonki ve kuch sthitiyon ke antargat paidaavaar yaa prajnan karne main sakasham hai jaise sookhaa, banjar, baadh, mitti kii vishaaktata, mitti kii lavanta jinamein se bahut se bhojan, samagriyaan pradaan karte hai or maanav ko shakti pradaan karne vaale pashudhan or anya jaanwaron manushya ke liye sambhavit rup se laabhakaari maane jate hai or ye jivan sahaayak jatiyon ke rup main jaani jaati hai
 As such they consist of mutual main castes because they have the main key to the integrity of the landforms that comprise the bio-data and human communities of both creatures
 donon paristhitiki or saamaajik aarthik jatiyaan jivan ke liye sahaayak jatiyaan hai
 Considering the problems mentioned earlier with the classification of castes, the following numbers are merely nominal guidance
 2007 main, ve nimnanusaar the: Total number of castes: 7-100 million including: eukrayete jatiyon main se hamane keval inaki pahchaan hi kar sake: Currently, the Global Texonomy Initiative, the European Distributed Institute of Texonomy and the Census of Marine Life are attempting to reform the taxonomy and implement the taxonomy system from previously unknown nations
 is satya ke kaaran ki ham jeev mandal main keval kuch praaniyon ko hi jaanate hai, phir bhi hamen apane paryaavaran ke kaamkaaj kii puri samaj nahin he
 According to Professor James Mellet, despite the discovery of new castes, we are making matters worse and we are ending these castes with unprecedented speed
 iskaa matlab yah bhi he ki kisi nai jati ko praapt karne se pehle iskaa adhyayan or vargeekaran kiya janaa chahie, chunki ho saktaa he ki vah pehle se hi vilupt ho chuki ho
 The notion of castes has a long history
 kai kaarnon se yah vargeekaran ke sabase mahatvapurn staron main se ek he: After years of experimentation, the concept of biology has been prominent as a host of related fields but has not yet been fully defined
 kisi vishesh jati ke namakaran ke jeevon ko us samooh ke jeevon ke vikasvaadi sambandh or or unki vividhta ke bare main pariklpana maani jaani chahie
 The hypothesis can be confirmed or refuted as advance information comes in hand
 kabhi-kabhi, khaskar jab ateet main sanchaar bahut adhik mushkil tha, to algaav par kaary karne vaale vargeekaran vaigyanikon ne alag-alag jantuon ko alag-alag naam die jinaki pahchaan baad main ek samaan jati ke rup main kii gai
 When a two-name caste was discovered as a single caste, the old caste name was usually retained and the new caste name was given that name, a process that is synonymous with aggregation or a colloquial process
 It is called
 texon ko ek se adhik main vibhajit karne main aamtaur se nayaa vaala vibhaajan texons kehalaata he
 Taxonomy Scientists are usually called "lumpers" or "splitters" by their classmates, depending on their individual attitudes and similarities to the differences identified between animals
 paramparaagat rup se, shodhakarta sanrachanaatmak antaron ke avlokan or is avlokan par ki kya bhinn aabaadi main jatiyon main atar ke liye unka antar prajnan safaltaapurvak kiya gaya athwa nahin, par bharosa karte hai; donon sharir rachana or prajnan vyavhaar donon hi abhi bhi jatiyon kii sthiti bataane ke liye mahatvapurn hai
 In the last few decades, as a result of the revolution in microbiological research techniques, DNA analysis has provided unfathomable knowledge about differences and similarities between castes
 kai aabaadiyaan jo pehle pruthak jatiyon ke rup main maani jaati thim ko ab ek texonmana jaataa he or purv samoohikrut aabaadi ko vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Any classification level can be synonymous or subdivided, and at higher taxonomic levels these modifications are still very unfathomable
 vargeekaran ke drushtikon se, jati main samoohon ko jati kii tulana main texon vargeekaran ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 Only sub-castes are used in zoology whereas diversity, sub-diversity and form have been used in botany
 sangrakshan jeev vigyaan main, vikasvaadi mahatvapurn ikai kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jise jati yaa adhik choti vicitra aabaadi vaale khand ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 In the early work of science, castes were simply individual beings representing their own or nearly identical group of beings
 us samay un par inke alaava koi anya sambandh lagu nahin hote the
 Aristotle used the term genus and caste to refer to caste or special classes
 arestu or anya purv-darvinian vaigyanikon ne jatiyon ko "saar" jaise rasinic tatwon ke rup main vishesh or aparivartaneey mana
 jab aarambhik prekshkon ne jeevon ke liye sanghathan ko pranali ke rup main viksit karnaa chaalu kiya, to unhone pehle se pruthak ko is sthaan par rakhana aarambh kar diya
 Many of these early illustration schemes will no longer be considered eccentric and include colors or behaviors based on coherence
 18 veen sadi main swedish vaigyanik carolas linius ne prajnan angon ke anusaar jeevon kaa vargeekaran kiya
 Although their type of classification of organisms classified organisms according to similarity, they did not make any claims about the relationship between similar castes
 
 us samay, vyapak rup se abhi bhi yah vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki jatiyon ke madhya koi bhi mana he ki vahaan jaivik jatiyon ke bich koi bhi jaivik sambandh nahin tha, bhale hi ve kitne hi samaan dikhaai kyon na dete hon
 is drushtikon ne bhi ek prakaar ke adarshavaad kaa suzav diya: yah dharna ki maujuuda sabhi jatiyaan ek "adarsh swaroop" he
 Although there are always differences between all the organisms over there, Linnaeus considered such differences problematic
 He attempted to identify individual organisms which were exemplary of castes and considered other non-exemplary organisms to be unusual and incomplete
 19 veen sadi tak adhikansh prakrutivaadee samaj gaye the ki jati samay samay par badal sakati hai or yah ki grih ke itihaas ne unamem mukhya parivartanon ke liye paryaapt samay diya tha
 jean-baptiste Lamarck gave the first logical idea against creation-theory in Zoological Philosophy
 jatiyaan samay ke saath-saath kaise badal sakati he ke nirdhaaran ke bare main nai praathamikta thi
 Lamarck suggested that the organism could pass on an inherited trait to its incoming lineage, such as reaching the leaves of a giraffe's long neck-high trees was a trait of the giraffe's generation
 haalanki, 1860 main charles darwin kii prakritik chayan vichaar kii sweekruti ke saath, lenmark ke lakshya-unmukh vikaas ke drushtikon jise teleological prakriya ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he ko prabhaavaheen kar diya gaya tha
 Recent interest in inheritance of features acquired around methylation processes such as methylation that does not affect DNA sequence, but expression may be altered in an inherited manner
 is prakaar, nio-lamarkwaad, jiseki kabhi-kabhi iske bare main baat bhi hui hai ki prakritik chayan ke saath vikaas kaa siddhant koi chunauti nahin he
 Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace gave the idea which is still followed by the theory of scientific development in the most powerful and compelling form
 darwin ne tark diya ki yah shaamil aabaadi hi thi koi praani maatr nahin
 His argument is more credible than the perspective of Linnaeus's radical stream: Instead of interpreting race as an ideal term, Darwin considered the difference between organisms to be natural
 He further argues that his explanation for the existence of a rare caste, far from problematic, was in fact
 darwin ke kaam ne thomas malthske antardrushti ko apni taraf aakarshith kiya ki jaivik jansankhya kii vruddhi dar paryaavaran main sansadhano kii vruddhi dar se hameshaa aage rahegi jiseki bhojan kii aapurti
 iske parinamswaroop, darwin ne tark diya ki aabaadi ke sabhi jeev nirvaah or prajnan karne main sakasham nahin honge
 The work done by them will be average, but there will be a difference - although they will make it a little more environmentally friendly
 If the difference of these qualities is ancestral, then the descendants of the survivors will take them
 is prakaar, kai pidiyon se anukuli vividhtaayen aabaadi main jamaa ho jaaengi, jabaki pratikul gun samaapt ho jaaenge
 It should be emphasized whether a difference in the environment is adaptive or non-adaptive: different environments favor different qualities
 kyonki paryaavaran hi kargar dhang se is baat kaa chayan karata he ki kis praani ko prajnan ke liye jivit rahanaa he or vah paryaavaran hi he jo is baat kaa nirdhaaran karte he ki kaunse gun aage jane chahie
 It is the principle of evolution by natural selection
 is model main, ek jiraph kii gardan kii lambaai kii vyakhya sthiti ke anusaar kii jaaegi ki lambii gardan vaale proto-jiraph ne vishesh prajnankaree visheshaataaon ko choti gardan vaale jiraph se praapt kiya kai pidiyon se, puri aabaadi lambii gardan vaale pashuon kii jati kii hogi
 In 1859, when Darwin published his theory of natural selection, there was no knowledge of mechanisms with individual properties of inheritance at that time
 haalanki darwin ne gun ke vanshanukram se praapt hone ke bare main kuch kalpanaaen kii, lekin usnaa siddhant keval is sachai par aadhaarit tha ki vanshanukram gun maujuud hote hai or ve parivartanashin hote hai
 However, the paper on Gregor Mandel's genetics was published in 1866 without identifying its characteristics
 is par 1900 tak koi kaary nahin kiya gaya jab unke kaary kii pun: khoj hugo di verise, karl corence or erik won semark dwaara tab kii gai jab unhen is baat kaa abhas hua ki darwin ke siddhant main "vanshanukram gun" jin hai
 The classification of castes of evolution through natural selection has two important assumptions for the discussion of castes - those results fundamentally challenge Linnaeus's hypotheses in favor of taxonomies
 sabase pehle isse yah pataa chalaa ki jatiyaan keval samaan nahin hai balki ve vastav main sambandhit bhi ho sakati he
 Some Darwin students argue that all species are descendants of common ancestors
 doosraa, yah mana jaataa he ki "jati" sajaateey, sthir, sthaayee chijen nahin he; jati ke sadsy bilkul bhinn hai or bahut samay pehle jatiyon main parivartan hua he
 This suggests that castes have no particular boundary region but have statistically significant effects of continuously changing gene-frequencies
 abhi bhi koi vyakti linius ke vargeekaran kaa upyog paudhon or jaanwaron kii pahchaan ke liye kar saktaa he, lekin koi bhi vyakti ab jatiyon ke swatantra or aparivartaneey rup ke bare main soch bhi nahin saktaa
 The development of a new caste from the ancestral lineage is called speciation
 isaki vanshaj jati se purvaj jati kaa nirdhaaran koi spasht vansh vaala simakan nahin he
 However, current scientific knowledge of castes has shown that in all cases there is no concrete and comprehensive way to differentiate between different castes, so that zoologists continue to look for concrete methods to carry out the idea
 
 One of the most popular biological definitions about race is in terms of reproductive isolation, if two animals are not capable of breeding hybrid offspring of both sexes, they belong to different races
 is paribhaasha main sahaj gyaan yukt jatiyon kii simaaen hai, lekin yah apurna hai
 For example, there is nothing to say about the caste that breed asexually and it is very difficult to apply it to the extinct castes
 iske alaava, jatiyon ke bich kii simaaen aksar aspasht hoti hai: aise kai udhaaharan hai jahaan par kisi vishesh aabaadi ke sadsy duusari aabaadi vaale praaniyon ke saadh jananksham sankar vansh kaa prajnan karte hai or duusari aabaadi ke sadsy teesri aabaadi vaale praaniyon ke saadh upjau sankar vansh kaa prajnan kar sakate hai lekin pehali or teesri aabaadi vaale sadsy upjau sankar kaa prajnan nahin kar sakate yaa keval mata pita se hi upjau vansh ko janm sambhav he
 As a result, some people reject this definition of caste
 richard daakins do praaniyon kii vyakhya sajaatiyata ke rup main karte hai or yadi unke chromosomes kii sankhya samaan hoti he or prayek chromosomam ke liye donon praaniyon main samaan sankhya main gunasutra hote hai 
 haalanki, adhiktar sabhi vargeekaran vaigyanik is bate se asahmat honge
 For example, in many amphibians, especially in New Zealand, the genome of Leopelma frogs has "native" genomes that are not distinct and have secondary chromosomes that exist in many combinations
 haalanki, aabaadi ke gunasutron kii sankhya main atyadhik antar paaya jaataa he, phir bhi ye safaltaapurvak antar prajnan kar sakate hai or ek ekal vikaskaari ikai banaate hai
 In plants, polyploidy is a highly common site with some inhibitions on differential reproduction; Because sets of chromosomes of animals are dissected by even numbers, which depends on the actual number of sets of current chromosomes where some animals of the same evolutionary unit can interbreed with some others and some and not the entire population
 Has been specifically linked to form a common gene pool
 jatiyon kaa vargeekaran vishesh taur se takneekee pragati se prabhavit ho rahaa he jisaki anumati shodhakartaaon ne unke sambandh ko anvik nishaan ke aadhaar par, crude rakt plasma vaale teevr pramaanon ko 20veen shatabdi ke madhya main charles sible ke ground-braking DNA-DNA sankaran adhyayan, 1970 main, kii tulana main DNA takanic anukraman ko janm diya
 These techniques resulted in radical changes in the higher taxonomic classes, leading to the rearranged results of many branches of the phylogenetic tree
 For the taxonomic sections of Jainra below, the results were mixed together; At the molecular level, the pace of evolutionary change was slowed, giving clear differences only after a suitable period of reproductive isolation
 While the results of DNA – DNA hybridization were misleading, the Pomeranian Scoa - Great Scoa phenomenon became a well-known example
 kachhue ko aanvik str par anya sarisrup kii gati ke maatr aathven bhaag ke saath viksit hone ke liye nirdhaarit kiya gaya or albatras main aanvik vikaas kii dar storm-petrals kii tulana main lagbhag aadhi hi pai jaati he
 Obsolete hybridization techniques are available nowadays and are replaced by more reliable computational approaches for sequence comparisons
 anvik vargeekaran sidhe vikasvaadi prakriyaaon par aadhaarit nahin he, balki in prakriyaaon dwaara samgr parivartan kiya jaataa he
 Processes that represent generation and diversity maintenance such as change, process of change, and selection are not homogenous

 In its early times, medicine was studied in the same way as a branch of biology
 baad main 'sharir rachana' tathaa 'sharir kriya vigyaan' aadi ko iskaa aadhaar banaaya gaya
 The birth of medicine in India was several thousand years BC
 It was initially studied as a branch of biology, and anatomy and physiology were made the basis of it
 sharir main honevaali kriyaaon ke gyaan se pataa laga ki unka rup bahut kuch rasinic he or ye ghatnaayen raasaanik kriyaaon ke fal hai
 As soon as the discovery took place, the chemical form of the events of the body came out
 is prakaar rasayan vigyaan kaa itnaa mahatv badha ki vah ayurvigyaan kii ek pruthak shakha ban gaya, jiskaa naam jeevarsayan rakhaa gaya
 By this, not only the form of physical events became clear, but also the origin of diseases and methods of resistance came out
