 In ambient temperatures between 5 and 30 degrees, the devil was able to maintain body temperature between 37
4 and 38 degrees
 jab taapmaana 40 se badhaya gaya tha or ardrata 50% rakhi gai to 60 minute ke bheetar divil ke sharir kaa taapmaana do degree upar ho gaya, lekin iske baad dhire-dhire kam hota hua do ghante baad praarambhik str par pahunch gaya or do ghante tak ise banaae rakhaa

 Other unusual materials seen in the devil's feces include the animal's leash and tags, the echidna's secure spine, pencils, plastic, and jeans
 Although devils can cut metal nets, they protect their strong jaws to escape from bondage instead of encroaching into the food store

 They sniff a flock of sheep from 10-15 meters away and attack a sheep if they become ill

 There are reports that despite the lack of extreme speed, they can run from 25 km / h to 1
5 km and it is estimated that before the introduction of European immigration and animals, vehicles and death on the road, they have to find food
 Other native animals had to be chased at the proper speed
 pemberton ne bataaya he ki ve prati saptaah kai raaton ko "vistaarit avadhi" main 10 kimi prati ghanta kii gati se daud sakate hai, ve sthir hokar baithne se pehle lambii duriyon tak daud sakate hai, aisa kuch jise ghaat laga kar hamalaa karne kaa pramaan mana gaya he
 They can also dig to find the corpse, in one case digging to eat the corpse of a horse that died of disease

 They consume an average of about 15% of their body weight per day; However, if given the opportunity, they can eat up to 40% of their weight in 30 minutes
 iskaa matlab yah ki ek bade bhojan ke baad yah bahut baari or sust ho saktaa he, is sthiti main yah dagamagaate hue dhire dhire jaataa he or let jaataa he or us tak pahunchnaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 This has led to the belief that such eating habits have become possible due to the lack of predatory predator attacks on such bloated animals
 tasmanian divil ek chote jaanavar ke shav ke sabhi avshesh saaf kar saktaa he, jarurat padane par fer or haddiyaan tak nigal jaataa he
 In this regard, the devil has earned the gratitude of Tasmanian farmers, the speed with which it cleans the carcass, helping to prevent the spread of insects that may harm livestock
 inamen se kuch mrit jaanwaron kaa nipataara tab hota he, jab divil atirikt bhojan ko baad main khaanaa shuru karne ke liye ghaseet kar apane nivas par le jate hai
 According to a study in Cradle Mountain, the devil's dose may vary by male, female and season, in winter, males prefer smaller mammals in the ratio of 4: 5 than in adults, but in summer they prefer 7: 2
 Prefer larger prey in proportion to

 Females are less inclined to target less large prey, but seasonal bias also occurs in them
 sardiyon main bade or madhyam standhari 25 or 58% prayek tathaa 7% chote stanpayi or 10% pakshi khaae jate hai
 In summer, 61 and 37% are consumed respectively for the first two categories
 kishor divil kabhi kabhi pedo par chadhane ke liye jane jate hai; kasherukeey or aksherukiyon ke alaava, bhringkon evam pakshiyon ke andon ko khaane ke liye kishor divil pedo par chadhate hai
 Teens have also been seen climbing trees and catching birds from nests
 puure varsh ke dauraan, vayask divil aple jaiwabhaar seven kaa 16
2% vrikshavasi prajatiyon se, joki lagbhag sara posam maance hota he, tathaa 1% bade pakshiyon se praapt karte hai
 From February to July, juvenile devils derive 35
8% of their biomass intake from arboreal life, 12
2% from small birds, and 23
2% from possum meat

 Not all of these animals were caught in the trees, but this elevated figure of females, which is higher than the spotted-tailed male quoll in the same season, is unusual, because the devil's skill at climbing trees is weak

 a solitary animal that collectively eats, this combination makes it unique among carnivores
 is jaanavar ke saath judaa hua adhikansh shor iske karkash samuhik khaane kaa parinaam he, jahaan 12 tak divil ikatthe hote hai, or aksar kai kilometak dur se suna ja saktaa he
 This is due to informing associates of their involvement in food so that food is not wasted by rot and energy is also saved
 shor kii maatra shav ke aakaar se sahasambaddha he
 Devils eat according to a system

 Usually, the powerful animal eats until it is satisfied and leaves, fighting off any challenges in the meantime
 haare hue jaanavar khadey bal or poonch ke saath jhaadi main daud jate hai, unka vijeta peeche se kaat kar unhen khadedta he
 Fights are less common as the source of food increases, as they are aimed at getting enough food and not suppressing other devils
 When the quolls are eating a corpse, the devils try to chase them away
 chiththidaar poonch vaale quol ke liye yah ek mahatvapurn samasya he, kyonki ve apekshaakrit bade posam ko maarthe hai or dawilon ke aagaman se pehle khaanaa khatm nahin kar pate

 This is seen as a possible cause of the relatively small population of spotted-tailed quolls

 They can stand on their hind legs and push each other's shoulders with their front legs and head, like sumo wrestling
 Occasionally torn flesh near the mouth and teeth, as well as holes on the tendon, can be seen, although these injuries may have occurred during reproduction

 Devils are known to return to the same place for defecation, due to doing so at a community location, the place is called Devil Toilet
 yah mana jaataa he ki saamudayik shouch, sanchaar kaa ek saadhan ho saktaa he jise thik se samajha nahin gaya
 The size of the devil's wings is much larger than that of the body; It has an average length of 15 cm, but also a sample of 25 cm in length
 ve haddiyon ko pachaa vajah se rang main bhure rang ke visheshta he, yaa haddi ke tukade bhi shaamil hai
 Owen and Pemberton believe that the relationship between the Tasmanian devil and the thylacine is "close and complex", as they competed directly for hunting and perhaps also shelter, the thylacine hunted the devils and the devils ate the dead thylacine, and Devils ate the thylacine's baby
 Mena Jones hypothesizes that the two species share the role of Tasmania's top predator
 keel-poonch chil kaa laash aadhaarit aahaar dawilon ke samaan he isiilie inhen bhi ek pratiyogi ke rup main mana jaataa he
 Quoll and Devil are also seen in direct competition in Tasmania
 jones kaa maananaa tha ki quol ne apane ko 100-200 pidhiyon ke baad lagbhag do varsh main viksit kiya he, jaisaa ki dawilon, sabase badi prajati, chiththidaar-poonch vaale quol, sabase choti prajati purvi quol par baraabar rikti prabhaav dwaara nirdhaarit kiya gaya he
 Females usually start breeding when they reach sexual maturity in their second year
 is bindu par, ve saal main ek baar upjau hoti hai or kamottejnaa main kai dimbon kaa nirmaan karti hai
 Since hunting is abundant in spring and early summer, the reintroduction cycle of devils begins in March or April so that weaning time coincides with the maximization of food supplies in the wild for newborn devils
 Occurring in March, mating occurs during both day and night in shelters
 prajnan ke mausam main nar maadaaon ke liye ladate hai or maadaa divil prabhutv paane vaale ke saath sahavaas karti he
 Females can ovulate up to three times in a 21-day period, and intercourse can be five days; For example, a pair is recorded in a rati den for eight days
 dawills, ekapatnik nahin hote hai or maadaaen sambhog ke baad raksha nahin kii jaati he to kai naron ke saath sambhog karti hai; nar bhi mausam ke dauraan kai maadaaon ke saath punarutpaadan karte hai
 Females have been shown to be selective in an effort to ensure the best genetic progeny, for example by driving small males away

 Theoretically this means that a devil population can double on an annual basis and overcome the species with high mortality

 Tasmanian devil children are called by various names, "paps", "joyce" or "imps"
 When young are born, competition fierce as they move from the vagina to the sac in a viscous flow of mucus
 ek baar thili ke andar aane par, unamem se prayek agle 100 dinon ke liye ek nipal se judaa rahata he
 The female Tasmanian devil's bag, such as the Wombat, opens backwards, so it is physically difficult for the female to interact with the children inside the pouch

 Once the baby makes contact with the nipple, it expands, resulting in the enlarged nipple tightening tightly inside the newborn, ensuring that the newborn does not fall out of the pouch
 On average, females live longer than males, and up to 60% of puppies do not live to mature

 During this transitional phase outside the sac, young devils are relatively safe from predation because usually someone is with them

 Guiller has reported that hostile devils have had frequent hermaphroditism, while Pemberton and Mooney recorded in 2004 an animal with a scrotum and a non-functional sac

 Brown also proposed that the El niño-southern Oscillation strengthened during the innovative era, and that the devil was highly sensitive to it, with a short life span as a scavenger

 The population of Tasmanian devils was calculated by Tasmania's Primary Industries and Water Department in 2008 in the range of 10,000 to 100,000 animals, with perhaps 20,000 to 50,000 mature animals

 The species was listed unprotected in 2005 under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 and in 2006 under the Australian Environment Protection and Conservation Act 1999, meaning it is at risk of extinction in the "medium term"

 However Guiller's research asserts that the real cause of cattle loss was poor land management policies and wild dogs

 In earlier times, Valleby's hunting for Possum and Fur was a big trade — more than 900,000 animals were hunted in 1923 — and resulted in constant hunting of devils as they were considered a major threat to the fur industry
 , Even quolls were more adept at hunting relevant animals

 This is not considered a sufficient problem for the devil to survive

 The decline in the number of devils is also seen as an ecological problem, with its presence in the Tasmanian forest ecosystem believed to be the reason for the establishment of red foxes, which were illegally introduced in Tasmania in the early 21st century Is, and because of the devils' eating of dead animals, it limited the number of foxes, wild cats and dogs, otherwise In den as killing adult foxes and young foxes that are their food
 In all other Australian states, foxes are a problematic invasive species, and in Tasmania, fox settling will disrupt the health of the Tasmanian devil and will be prey to many vertebrate species
 It is believed that young Tasmanian devils are insecure from eating red fox meat, and there will be direct competition for the den and habitat of those devils and foxes
 a common means of trying to prevent foxes is to use meat that is decorated with sodium fluoroacetate to trap
 As devils and other native animals can also be attracted to poisonous meat, which is placed inside the M-44 ejector device, adaptations have been made to the geometry of the device and the force and jaws required to open it
 Geometry, which fits the fox but does not fit the local species
 The foxes have not yet been fully established in Tasmania to intimidate Tasmanian devils

 At the same time, there was a greater increase in vehicular deaths along the new road; While there were no deaths in the last 6 months
 It is believed that most of the deaths occurred due to increase in speed in the closed part of the road
 It was speculated that it was more difficult for animals to see against black bitumen than light gravel

 Lubricants perform the following important functions
 aam taur par lubricant ko kisi pranali main gatisheel bhaagon ko alag rakhane ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 This has the advantage of reducing surface labor while reducing friction and heat generation, operating noise and vibration
 lubricant ise kai tareekon se hasil karte hai
 The most common is by the formation of a physical barrier, ie the lubricant separates the moving parts
 ise hydrodinamik lubrication kaha jaataa he
 At high surface pressures or temperatures the fluid layer is very thin and some forces are transmitted to the surfaces through the lubricant
 ise elasto-hydrodinamik lubrication kaha jaataa he
 Lubricant-to-surface friction is generally less than surface-to-surface friction in any system of lubricant
 is prakaar lubricant kaa upyog samgr pranali ke gharshan ko kam kar detaa he
 Low friction has the advantage of low heat generation and low formation of wear particles as well as improved efficiency
 Lubricants may include additives called friction modifiers that chemically bind solid surfaces to reduce surface friction, even when there is insufficient bulk lubricant for hydrodynamic lubrication, e
g
 Protection of valve train in car engine at start-up
 donon gas or taral lubricant taap antarit kar sakate hai
 However, liquid lubricants are more effective due to their high specific heat capacity
 aam taur par taral lubricant pranali ke cooler bhaag se or usamen parichaalit hota he, haalanki lubricant kaa istemaal garm tathaa thande karne ke liye ho saktaa he jab niyantrit taapmaana kii aavashyaktaa ho
 yah parisanchari pravaah kisi niyat samay main ikai main dur jane vaale taap kii maatra bhi nirdhaarit karata he
 High flow systems can carry a lot of heat and also have the added benefit of reducing thermal stress on the lubricant

 Non-flowing lubricants such as grease and paste are not effective during heat transfer, although at first they contribute by reducing heat generation
 lubricant sancharan pranaaliyon se aantarik rup se janit malbe or pranali main aane vaale bahya dooshit padaarthon ko dur le jane kaa laabh he, jo filter main pahunchate hai jahaan se unhen hataaya ja saktaa he
 Lubricants for machines that routinely generate debris or contaminants such as automotive engines typically include detergents and dispersed additives to transport and remove debris and contaminants to the filter
 samay ke saath filter bhar jayega or safaai yaa use badalane kii zarurat hogi, atah sifarish kii jaati he ki car main tel badalte samay oil filter bhi badal daalen
 gear box jaisi band pranaaliyon main filter main chumbak anupoorak shaamil ho saktaa he taaki utpann baariq lohe ke chure aakarshith ho jaaen
 It is clear that oil in a communications system can only be as clean as the filter can make it, thus it is unfortunate that no industry standards exist that allow consumers to easily evaluate the filtering ability of various automotive filters
 Can
 Poor filtration specifically reduces the life of the machine as well as disables the system
 hydrolic taral ke rup main gyaat lubricant kaa upyog hydrostatic vidyut sanchaar main kaaryakari taral padaarth ke rup main kiya jaataa he

 taral lubricanton kii tulana main gasiy lubricant main bahut kam chipchipahat or adhik sampeden hoti he, lekin taral-jhilli siddhant gaison ke samroop lagu hote hai
 Some examples of gaseous lubricants are air, technical gases, steam or liquid-metal vapor
 taral lubricant ke lakshan kai alag tareekon se varnit kiye ja sakate hai
 One of the most common methods is by the type of base oil used
 The following are the most common types

 Another phenomenon on which research has been done in high temperature breakdown prevention and lubrication is 'layer climbing'
 It is the generation of a solid oxide layer, which normally accumulates at high temperatures, with metal surfaces sliding against each other to form a crystalline 'layer'
 Friction and wear can be reduced due to the avoidance of metal contact and adhesion by the production of oxides
 prabhavi rup se, is tarah kii sataha swa-chiknayee vaali hoti he
 Since the 'layer' is already an oxide, it can survive at very high temperatures in air or oxidizing environments
 tathaapi, aadhaar dhaatu ke liye zaruri hone kii vajah se ise asuvidha he ki paryaapt oxide malba utpann karne ke liye pehle ise tut-foot se guzaranaa hoga

 vahaan shreniyan maujuud hai A, B, C, e akshar kaa anusaran karti sankhyaon ke saath
 japan ne motorbike injanon ke liye JASO vinirdesan pravartit kiya
 In the industrial market, the specification may take the form of a legal contract that supplies the corresponding fluid, or the buyer can choose to purchase based on the manufacturer's own published specifications
 aksar vinirdesh ek nunatam sweekaarya nishpaadan str nirupit karte hai
 Thus many device manufacturers tighten the tolerance on a common specification to add to their specific requirements or to meet their needs
 This gives lubricant marketers the opportunity to differentiate their product by designing to meet the OEM specification
 aksar, OEM vyapak pareekshan karata he or anumodith utpaadon kii sakriy suchi kaa anurakshan karata he
 It is a powerful marketing tool in the lubricant market

 The Language Movement Day or the Language Revolution Day or the Bengali Language Movement Day, also referred to as the Language Martyr's Day or Martyr's Day, is a national day to die in Bangladesh during protests during the Bengali Language Movement in 1952 This day is celebrated to remember the sacrifices of students
 bharat ke vibhaajan ke baad 1947 purvi bengal main bengali bolne vaale the, jo pakistan ke niyantran main aa gaya tha
 There were also government, government personnel and army, but all were from West Pakistan
 1947 ko ek mahatvapurn sankalp par ek rashtriya shiksha shikhar sammelan main karachi main ek rashtriya shiksha shikhar sammelan hua tha, jisamen ek mahatvapurn sankalp liya gaya
 In this, it was decided to make Urdu the only language of the state, which would be used in the news and also in schools
 vipaksh dwaara virodh bhi hua or ek bengali islamic saanskrithik sanghathan, tamaaddun majalish ke sachiv abul kashim ke netritv main dhaka main virodh shuru hua
 The meeting then decided to make the Bengali language the official language of East Bengal and it was also adopted as a medium of education
 haalanki, pakistan lok seva ayog ne vishyon kii suchi se bengali ko hataa diya isi ke saath hi dak tikaton or mudraon se bhi is bhashaa ko hataa diya tha
 
 Union Education Minister Fazlur Rahman had made extensive preparations to make Urdu the only language of the state

 To promote this, students also organized processions and rallies
 1952 main bengali chaatro ne purvi pakistan main pakistani sarkaar dwaara urdu ko rashtriya bhashaa banane ki ghoshnaa karne ke baad uske virodh main juluus nikaala
 The proportion of Pakistani citizens was 54% in 1952, enough for the majority
 virodh pradarshan main kai chaatro kii mrityu ho gai, jo bengali bhashaa ko bhavishya kii pidiyon ke liye bachaana chaahate the
 The students started the meeting at 9 am in the Dhaka University campus, where Section 144 was already installed
 yahan vishvavidhyalay ke vaais-chancelar or anya adhikari maujuud the, iske alaava sashastr police bal dwaara parisar ghira hua tha
 Eleven of a quarter of the students gathered at the university's gate and tried to break the line created by the police
 police ne aansu gas ke gole dwaar kii ore daal kar chaatro ko chetavanee di
 Students of one class tried to escape from Dhaka University and managed to escape, while others were surrounded by police in the university campus
 vaais-chancelar police ko hamalaa na karne or chaatro ko jagah chhodane ko kehete hai
 But the police arrest many students for violating Section 144, they keep trying to go out
 giraftaar se naaraaz chaatro ne purv bengal vidhaan sabha main mulaaqaat kii or vidhayakon kaa maarg avaruddh kar unhen is maamle ko vidhansabha main pesh karne kaa aagrah karti he
 But a group of students started climbing into the building like a storm, due to which the police started throwing fireballs
 isse kai chaatro kii maut ho gai

 The six mlas of the Legislative Assembly, including Manoranjan Dhar, Basantkumar Das, Shamsuddin Ahmed and Dhirendranath Dutta, requested that Chief Minister Nurul Amin visit the injured students to visit the hospital and adjourn the assembly as a token of condolence
 iskaa samarthan moulana abdur raashid tarkabagish, shorfuddin ahamed, shamsuddin ahamed khondokar or moshinuddin ahamed ne kiya
 Nurul Amin, however, refused to accept the request
 7 may 1954 main samvidhan sabha ne muslim lig ke samarthan ke baad bengali bhashaa ko aadhikarik bhashaa bana diya
 Bengali language was recognized as the second official language of Pakistan on 29 February 1956 and Urdu and Bengali became the official language of Pakistan under Article 214
 lekin jab pakistan main sainya sarkaar ne apana kabja jamaa liya to aayub khan ne phir se urdu ko ekmaatr rashtriya bhashaa banane kaa prayaas kiya
 On 6 January 1959, the military government officially issued a statement that they supported the policy of the 1956 Constitution
 aadhikarik bhashaaon kaa samaadhaan 1956 main hi ho gaya tha, lekin aayub khan purvi pakistan par vyay karne vaale paison kaa upyog pashchimi pakistan main karne laga
 Military services continued in East Pakistan despite the formation of a majority of the national population
 iske vitt or anya sarkari sevaaon main bhi katautee kiya gaya tha
 The lack of a representative government in this new fledgling state was also the main reason for this
 iske kaaran kshetreey aarthik asantulan hua or prabhaagon main vruddhi hui
 Due to this the Bengali ethnic nationalist Awami Party got the support of the people
 is dal ne 6 sutreey andolan shuru kiya, jiske maango main ek ye bhi tha ki purvi pakistan ko bangladesh kaha jaye
 This later led to the Bangladesh Liberation War
 is andolan ke uplakshya main shahid minar, ek pratikatmak murti banwaaya gaya tha, jo us narsanhaar or bangladesh ke nirmaan ko yaad dilaataa he, iskaa kuch had tak prabhaav pashchim bengal main bhi padaa
 This day is a public holiday in Bangladesh

 The iron in which magnetism is produced by the effect of electric current is called electromagnet
 iske liye lohe par taar lapetakar us taar se vidyut dhara bahaakar lohe ko chumbakit kiya ja saktaa he
 In 1820, Astend invented that electric current affects magnets
 iske baad hi usee saal anrego ne yah avishkaar kiya ki taanbe ke taar main bahati hui vidyut dhara ke prabhaav se iske nikat rakhe lohe or ispaat ke tukade chumbakit ho jate hai
 In October of the same year, Sir Humphrey Davy independently invented this fact
 san 1825 i
 main england ke wiliam sterjan ne pehla vidyut-chumbak banaaya, jo lagbhag 4 kilo kaa bhaar uthaa saktaa tha
 He bended an iron rod in the form of a horseshoe and wrapped an insulating wire on it
 taar main bijli kii dhara pravaahit karte hi chad chumbakit ho gaya or dhara band karte hi chad kaa chumbakatv lupt ho gaya
 Here the wire is wrapped in one direction from one end of the rod to the other, but when viewed from the front of the ends, the current on one arm of the bent rod rotates in the counterclockwise direction and on the other arm in the clockwise direction
 falswaroop chad kaa ek sira uttar-dhruv or doosraa dakshin dhruv ban jaataa he
 Inspired by Sturgeon's experiments in 1831, Joseph Henry of the United States built powerful electric magnets
 unhone lohe kii chad par lapete hue taron ke pheron kii sankhya badhaakar vidyutchumbak kii shakti badhaai
 The first magnet he made could carry a load of 350 kg and the second electric magnet he made after that, could carry a load of 1,000 kg
 unke vidyut chumbakon ko kai cell kii bydaree kii dhara se hi uparyukt prabal chumbakatv praapt hota tha
 After this, even more powerful electric magnets were progressively constructed
 san 1891 i
 main du boy ne ek bade vidyut chumbak kaa nirmaan kiya
 At the core of this electric magnet, 2,400 rounds of wire were wrapped and when an electric current of 50 amperes was passed through the wire, a strong magnetic field of 40 thousand gauss was generated between this electric magnet
 is vidyut chumbak ke dhruv shanku ke aakaar ke the or ek duusare ke sammukh the
 The free space between the poles was 1 mm in length and 6 mm in diameter
 du bis ne jo sabase bada chumbak banaaya, uskaa vajan 27 handredwet tha or uske dhruvon ke bich 3 mimi lambii or 0
5 mimi vyas kii jagah main 65 hajaar gouse kaa chumbakeey kshetra utpann hota tha
 P
 Wise also produced very powerful electric magnets
 inke dwaara nirmit ek vidyut chumbak main taanbe kii nalika ke 1,440 phere the or usase 100 ampiore kii dhara bahaai jaati thi
 The water was kept cool by pouring water from inside the tube
 du boy ke vidyut-chumbak main bhi lapete hue taar khokhli nalika ke rup main hote the or nalika ke andar pani bahaakar use thandha rakhaa jaataa tha
 For the magnet of an electric magnet, there is a behavior of iron that has a high magnetic tendency, the magnetization of residue of the core is lowest when the magnetizing current is closed and it does not attain magnetic infancy soon
 vidyut chumbak ke crode ke liye pitwaan lohe, athwa dhalwaan naram ispaat, kaa vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 But any type of iron treated, its magnetism cannot cross a certain limit, no matter how much the magnetizing current is increased
 isliye ati prabal chumbakeey kshetra utpann karne ke liye kapitza ne taar ko parinalika kaa vyavhaar kiya, jiskaa crode vaayu thi
 a transient current of 8,000 amperes from a dominant generator in this solenoid for 3 / 1000 seconds produced a magnetic field of 3,20,000 gauss inside that solenoid
 kaarkaanon main vidyut chumbak dwaara baari bojhon ko uthaane kaa kaam liya jaataa he
 On the burden which has to be lifted, they tie an iron track
 vidyut chumbak se dhara pravaahit karte hi vidyut chumbak chumbakit hokar lohe kii patari or patari se lage boj ko aakarshith karke uthaa letaa he
 This force of carrying the burden of an electric magnet can be extracted with the help of the following sources
 vaigyanik anusandhanon main vidyut chumbak kaa bahut mahatvapurn upyog hota rahaa he
 With the help of an electromagnet, Faraday invented the photographic Faraday-effect, Zeeman the Zeeman-effect and Kerr invented the Kerr-effect
 aaweshit kanon ko mahaan veg pradaan karne ke liye, cychlotron, betatron, syncrotron or biwatron ityadi adbhut yantra bane hai
 They also have the behavior of huge electric magnets
 prati din kaam aanevaale anek yantron or upkarnon main chote bade vidyut chumbakon kaa vyavhaar hota he
 In electric bells, the electromagnet behaves in telegraphs and telephones, because the electromagnet has the characteristic that it is magnetized as the current flows in it and is magnetized as soon as the current is closed, and its magnetism, a Within a certain range, the current flowing in the coil wrapped on that electric magnet is proportional
 laudspikar main, dhara janitron main, bijli ke motaron main, bijli ke horn main or chumbakeey klach main vidyut-chumbak kaa vyavhaar hota he
 In electrical circuits, relay work is done by an electromagnet, that is, a hundred and thousand ampere current is established by remotely pressing the switches of hundred and thousand ampere current
 anek prakaar ke swachaalit yantron main vidyut chumbakon kaa upyog hota he
 In fact, calculating the force exerted on ferromagnetic materials is a complex task
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki vastuon ke aakaar aadi bhinn-bhinn hote hai jiske kaaran sabhi sthitiyon main chumbakeey kshetra kii gananaa ke liye koi saral sutara nahin hai
 If we want to estimate it more accurately, then finite-element-method has to be used
 kintu kuch vishesh sthitiyon ke liye chumbakeey kshetra or bal kii gananaa ke sutara diye ja sakate hai
 For example, see the picture in front
 yahan adhikansh chumbakeey kshetra, ek ucch pargamyata ke padaarth main hi simit he
 The value of maximum force for this situation is as follows- jahaan: In the given case, the permeability of the air is approximately equal to the permeability of the vacuum
 atah μ o = 4 π ⋅ 10 − 7 h ⋅ m − 1 { \ displaystyle \ mu _{o}=4 \ pi \ cdot 10^{-7} \ ,{ \ mbox{h}} \ cdot { \ mbox{m}}^{-1}}, or ikai kshetrafal par lagane vaala bal : For the given magnetic circuit, the value of b can be given by the following formula: jahaan: On substituting it, the following formula is found- shaktishaalee vidyutchumbak banane ke liye kam lambaai kaa chumbakeey path tathaa adhiksh kshetrafal vaala tal chaiye
 The reason for this is that most ferromagnetic materials are saturated between 1 and 2 tesla, so it is useless to try to make a magnet with higher h than this
