 dishtdhaara vidyutjanitr yantric urja ko vidyut urja main badalane vaali vidyut mashin he
 It is also called 'dynamo'
 dianemo farade ke moolbhoot siddhanton par aadhaarit he, jo is prakaar vyakt kiye gaye hai: This University The magnitude of the conductor depends on the length of the conductor, the magnetic charge density and the velocity of the conductor
 is prakaar Where b = density of magnetic conductance, l = length of conductor, v = velocity of conductor
 uparyukt siddhant ke anusaar hi, farade kaa doosraa siddhant he, jo vastut: iskaa poorak he:- The force exerted can be expressed by the following equation - jahaan F=chaalak par aropit bal, B=chumbakeey abhivah ghanatv, l=chaalak kii lambaai tathaa I=chaalak main pravaahit dhara
 Both of the above principles are very important in the field of electrical engineering
 vastav main ye siddhant urja ke ek rup main duusare rup main inhen siddhanton par aadhaarit hai
 The dynamo is the simplest device for practical use of these principles
 yah mashin donon siddhanton par aadhaarit he
 Dynama is the simplest device for practical use of these principles
 yah mashin donon siddhanton ko pratipaadit karti he
 Its main parts are magnets that generate magnetic fields and the mechanism of the conductors moving in that region, called armature
 farade ke siddhanton ko vyaavhaarik banane ke liye ek chaalak ke sthaan par kai chaalkon kaa hona aavashyak he, jo aapas main is prakaar yojit ho ki unamem prerak vi

 judakar vyavhaar yogya ho sake, athwa prayek par aropit bal judakar itnaa ho sake ki uskaa vyaavhaarik prayog kiya ja sake
 Drivers can be planned in many ways
 is yojanatantr ko armechar kundali kehete hai
 The magnetic field can also be obtained using the magnetic effect of electricity
 iske liye chumbakon ke sthaan par kshetrakundaliyaan hoti hai, jinamein dhara ke pravaahit hone se chumbakeey kshetra kii utpatti kii jaati he
 Burrows are used to carry or carry current in armature conductors, which connect movable conductors to the fixed ends of the outer circuit
 armechar chaalak usamen bane khaanchon main sthit hote hai, taaki adhik veg se ghoomte hue bhi ve apni sthiti main avasthit rahen
 The armature is located by a key on a shaft
 yantric urja se vidyut urja kaa janan karne kii avasthaa main yah shaft yantric urja ke sambharan se yugmak dwaara jod diya jaataa he, jisase armechar chumbakeey kshetra main ghoomane lagata he or usamen vi

 prerit ho jaataa he
 It is also possible to provide mechanical energy from electric energy through this device
 iske liye armechar sanchaalkon ko vidyutsambharan se yojit kar diya jaataa he, jisase unamem dhara kaa pravaah hone lagata he or chumbakeey kshetra main sthit hone ke kaaran unpar bal aropit ho jaataa he
 So the armature starts rotating
 armechar ke shaft ko kisi mashin se yojit kar dene par mashin ko chalaaya ja saktaa he or is prakaar utpann hui yantric urja kaa vyaavhaarik upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 The most common use of dynamo is to light a bicycle
 isamen yah ek chote yantra ke rup main hota he, jisamen chumbakeey kshetra, sthaayee chumbakon dwaara praapt kiya jaataa he or yantric urja chalati hui cycle ke pahie se praapt kii jaati he
 For this, there is a rubber piece in its armature shaft, which drives the shaft by friction from the rim of the bicycle
 is prakaar armechar chaalkon main utpann hua vi
vaa
va
 itnaa paryaapt hota he ki usase utpann dhara cycle kii batti ko jala sake
 a similar dynamo, in some larger sizes, is used in motorcars or buses, which receive mechanical energy from the engine of the motor and convert it into electrical energy
 isse battiyaan jalaai ja sakati he, motor kii bydaree charge kii ja sakati he tathaa vidyut shakti se pratipaadit honevaale duusare kaary kiye ja sakate hai
 This simple electric machine is in fact the mother of all types of electrical machines
 lagbhag sabhi vidyut mashine purv kathith do moolbhoot siddhanton par aadhaarit hai
 From the practical point of view, many changes have been made in the form of electric machines and many types of machines have been made

 ] The carbon dioxide from the air reacts with the alkali in the cement and makes the pore water more acidic, thus lowering the ph
 Carbon dioxide will start to carbonate the cement in the concrete from the moment the object is made
 This carbonatation process will start at the surface, then slowly move deeper and deeper into the concrete
 If the object is cracked, the carbon dioxide of the air will be better able to penetrate into the concrete
 When designing a concrete structure, it is normal to state the concrete cover for the rebar 
 The minimum concrete cover is normally regulated by design or building codes
 If the reinforcement is too close to the surface, early failure due to corrosion may occur
 One method of testing a structure for carbonatation is to drill a fresh hole in the surface and then treat the surface with phenolphthalein
 This will turn when in contact with alkaline cement, making it possible to see the depth of carbonatation
 An existing hole is no good because the exposed surface will already be carbonated ---> ] This phenomenon has been popularly referred to as "concrete cancer"

 Kolkata railway station, formerly known as Chitpur station, is one of the four Intercity railway stations in Kolkata and Howrah cities
 Apart from this, Sealdah station Shalimar station and Howrah station are also built in these two cities
 Kolkata station is located in Chitpur area of north East Kolkata
 jis jagah par aaj yah stesan bana hua he vahaan ek mamay me ek bada sa malgaudaam tha
 In the present, where bus and car parking has been made, as well as the route to the station, there was a large yard for loading coal in the freight train in the east
 vartmaan me jahaan platform bane hai vahaan malgadiya rukaa karti thi or is puure parisar ko chitpur rail yard ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 In 2000, it was planned to develop this complex as a passenger station due to the huge increase in the number of trains going through Sealdah and opening
 Due to lack of space, no more platoforms could be built in Sealdah and due to being located in the middle of Kolkata, the metropolitan rail service also generates more busyness here
 in sari samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye madhya-purv railway ne kolkata main lambii duuri ke trains ke liye ek or bade stesan ke nirmaan kaa prastaav rakhaa

 Finally, in the year 2003-04, the proposal of the Ministry of Railways got the proposal to convert Chitpur into a new large railway station
 Its election got additional strength due to being located in the middle of Kolkata and working as a freight terminal for more than a century
 Apart from this, compared to Shalimar and Mazerhat, the assets around the station here were also with the Railways

 These instructions can be simple or complex
 aise adeshon ke kuch maanak nirdesh hote hai
 They are like this
 stop los kisi share yaa suchakank kaa vah mulya hota he, jis par pahunchane ke baad saude band kar diye jate hai
 In the financial market, there is also a possibility of the price of any share bought going up and there is a possibility of going down
 share kaa bhav yadi neeche girane lagata he to vah kaaphi neeche pahunch saktaa he
 Hence its stop loss is fixed only when purchasing shares
 udhaahrantah yadi sau rupe kaa share liya gaya he, to 95 yaa 90 rupe aane par bech diya jaae
 What price to keep, or sell, even when the price reaches below it; This is the stop loss
 anubhaviyon ke anusaar share kharidte samay hi stop los ke bare main tay kar lenaa adhik laabhprad rahata he
 This facility is available in the broker's computer
 safal evam anbhavi stock niveshak ritern kaa anumaan or stop los par sadaa hi griddha-drushti banaaye rakhte hai
 Stop loss is also called stop order
 kisi share ke badhate hue bhav ke aankadon kii sarini main jis sthaan par share-bhav trend line ko kaat kar neeche kii ore jaae, vahiin us share kaa stoplos hota he
 Similarly, where the price in recession deals cuts above the trend line, there is a stop loss of those deals
 jab stoplos ko bhav ke saath badhaayaa yaa ghataya jaataa he, to use trailing stoplos kehete hai
 There are several types: bazaar main chadhate hue share ke bhav kaa graph jahaan se neeche kii ore mudata he, us sthiti yaa sthaan ko top yaa sheersh kehete hai
 Similarly, from where the graph starts climbing in the falling house, it is called bottom
 takneekee vishleshan main top or bottm kaa bada mahatv hota he
 If every next top and bottom in a chart is higher than the previous top and bottom respectively, then the stock or index is said to be in a boom phase
 isi tarah kisi chart main har aglaa top or bottm kramash: pichley top or bottm se neeche ho, to share yaa suchakank mandi ke daur main mana jaataa he
 In the bar chart of the stock price, the line which is found when a stock is connected to the highest and lowest prices of each day on a straight line is called the trend line or trend line
 girte hue share kii trend line us share ke ucchtam bhav se line khinchate hai, jabaki chadhate hue share kii trend line khinchne ke liye nunatam bhav se line khinchi jaati he
 For better results, the line is drawn from the density areas of the highest or lowest prices of several days in place of the highest or lowest price of a single day
 vyapaar rekha niveshkon ke liye atyant sahaayak hoti he, jise angreji main trend ij da best friend bhi kehete hai
 a breakdown of the trend means that the direction of the stock move is about to change
 yani agar share bhav gir rahaa ho or ekaek share kii keemten upar se khinchi gai rujhaan rekha ko katkar upar kii ore aane lagen, to samajhnaa chahie ki badhat shuru hone vaali he
 Conversely, if the trend line drawn from the rising stock or the lower price of the index starts going above the prices, then the fast deals should be cut
 ritern par nazar rakhane or milane vaale kaa anumaan lagane se niveshak ko vittiya lakshyon kii jaankaree milane par laabh-vasuuli saral ho jaati he
 This makes the decision easier whether the investor is profitable to invest in a particular business
 visheshgyon ke anusaar yadi ritern - jokhim anupaat paksh main nahin he to vah kaarobaar nahin karnaa chaiye
 For example, if you buy a stock of Rs 90 with a target of Rs 100 and the stop loss is below Rs 75, then the return-risk ratio is not in favor
 is maamle main lakshya keemat par share bechney ke baad 10 rupye prati share ke pratyaashit laabh ke liye 15 rupye prati share kii haani nuksaan uthaane ko taiyaar hai
 This way the risk is higher than the returns and it is prudent not to invest in this stock
 is prakaar stop losd kii jaankaree nivesh karnaa tay karne main atyant sahaayak hoti he
 Most analysts feel that traders should fix a stop loss based on their risk appetite

 If no other fruit is mentioned, brandy refers to distillate obtained from grape juice
 brandi main us falvishesh kii visheshtaayen, jiske ras se vah taiyaar kii gai ho, bahut kuch vidyaman rahati hai, parantu aswan kii kriya main suvaas nasht ho jaati hai
 Distilled extract from the fermented juice of another fruit combines the name of the fruit with brandy, such as 'apple brandy', 'nut brandy' etc
 iske atirikt kabhi kabhi bhugolic kshetra se praapt angoor ke aadhaar par bhi brandi kaa naam rakhaa jaataa he, jaise france ke praantvishesh main utpann honevaali angoor se praapt brandi, 'konyek brandi' ke naam se prasiddh he
 Alcohol content in brandy is less than 85% by volume
 asut madiraa main angoor kii brandi, athwa keval brandi, sambhavat: pracheenatam he
 In early times, grapefruit juice was used as an alcoholic liqueur, but through distillation in the tenth or eleventh century it produced life-water, which formed the basis of desirable properties of brandy
 brandi kii utpatti france main maani jaati he, parantu aajkal prayek desh main, jahaan angoor utpann hota he, brandi banaai jaati he
 The world's most famous brandy is derived from two provinces, namely Sharant and Haute Sharant in France

 In elementary algebra, the expression of many terms related to money and minus signs is called polynomial, viz
 padon kii sankhya ke anusaar iske vishisht upnaam 'ekapad', 'dwipad', aadi hote hai
 In higher mathematics, polynomial is typically used for expressions whose terms have zero or plus integer powers of any one variable amount, or more than one variable, in ascending or descending order, such as vyanjak kaa bahupad he or x, y z, kaa tathaa usamen achar he
 If, instead of assuming another expression everywhere, log x is placed, the new expression will be called the expression of log x
 padon ke ghaaton main se mahattam ko bahupad kaa ghaat kehete hai
 If there is more than one variable, then the sum of the sum of the powers of the variables in different terms is called the power of the polynomial
 is prakaar bahupad kaa ghaat 4 he or kaa 7
 It is also said that the polynomial has the sixth power and the second power
 do bahupadon kaa yogafal, antar or gunanfal bahupad hi hota he, kintu unka bhagfal bahupad nahin hota
 The quotient function is the quotient of two polynomials, which may contain only one number
 char main ghaat kaa vyapak bahupad yah he : a fundamental theorem of algebra is that if f is a polynomial of power m in the variable sum x, then the polynomial equation f = 0 always has m root
 ye mul sanmishra bhi ho sakate hai or sampati bhi
 If f = 0 has a root p1, then the part of the polynomial f is completely gone, and a polynomial f1 with the power m-1 is found in the quotient
 ab bahupad sameekaran f1 = 0 ke m-1 mul honge or yadi iskaa ek mul he, to phir f1 main kaa bhaag puraa chalaa jayega
 It is an important theorem that the factorization of f is unique
 yadi ham f ke gunankon or gunankhandon main prayukt sankhyaon par yah pratibandh laga den ki ve kisi amuk kshetra kii hongi, to mulon kaa astitv avashyambhavi nahin rahata
 It is important that if the factorization of polynomial can be done, the factors will be unique
 trikonmiti kaa ek mahatvapurn prameya yah he ki yadi m koi dhanatmak purnank he, to kojya mx kii abhivyakti kojya x ke m ghaatvale bahupad ke rup main kii ja sakati he, yatha The theorem about sine mx is that if m is odd then the expression of sine mx can be expressed as a polynomial of m th power of sine x and if m is even then the expression of sine mx / cosine x is m of sine x - 1 will be in the form of polynomial of power, such as vaishleshik gyomiti main vakron kaa adhyayan unhen do charon ke bahupad sameekaran dwaara nirupit kar kiya jaataa he
 Similarly, three variable polynomial equations are used to study the planes
 swecch ghaat ke bahupad samikarnon se nirupit vakron or talon kaa adhyayan bijiy jyamiti main kiya jaataa he
 a polynomial of two or more variables with the sum of the powers of the variables in each term is called the quadratic polynomial, or simply the quadratic; In modern algebra, the conversion of these equations and the principles of inductance and coherence related to these transformations have a prominent place and have many uses
 kalan main ek charavaale bahupad saral varg ke falan hai, kyonki inke avkalan tathaa samakalan ke niyam vishesh rup se saral hai or har sthiti main fal ek bahupad hota he
 In modern function theory, each polynomial is a continuous and analytic function of its variables
 is siddhant main ek mahatvapurn prameya yah he ki yadi sanmishra char kaa koi falan char ke prayek parimit maan ke liye vaishleshik he, to vah ek bahupad hi hoga or yadi char ke aparimit hone par bhi falan parimit rahata he, to vah keval ek achar he
 Polynomials are also used for approximation
 praanrabhik vishleshan ke maanak falan, mclarin athwa tailor prameya ke anusaar, ghaat shrenee dwaara nirupit kiye ja sakate hai
 Karl Wiestrasi proved in 1885 that any continuous function can be represented by a polynomial with a uniform approximation up to any degree of accuracy

 The hippocampus is a major component of the brain of humans and other mammals
 It is part of the limbic system and plays an important role in long-term memory and spatial guidance
 Like the cerebral cortex with which it is associated, it is found in a paired shape, much like a mirror image, with both parts in the left and right parts of the brain
 In humans and other apes species, the hippocampus medial temporal lobe It is located inside and below the cortical surface
 It has two main interconnecting parts: Emman's horn and dentate gyrus

 In rodents, the hippocampus was intensively studied as a system of the brain responsible for behavioral inhibition and caution, spatial memory, and guidance
 a major symptom of damage to the hippocampus in mice is increased activity
 Many neurons in the hippocampus of mice and mice act as endemic cells: when this organism moves to a specific part of its environment, it exerts an action potential
 The cells of the hippocampus and the direction of the head, whose activity as an inertial locomotor, affect each other extensively, as well as the grid cells present in the adjacent antorhinal cortex
 Are included

 The buccal figure along the lower surface of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle is first described by Venetian anatomy scientist Julius Caesar Aranzi, in which he first described it as a sea horse in which he used the Latin hippocampus or alternative form Has also compared it to silkworm
 German anatomy scientist Duvernoy first described it as "sea horse" and "silkworm" with no doubt
 Danish anatomy scientist Jacob Winslow proposed the name "horn of sheep" in 1732; a decade later, the Parisian anatomy scientist, The Surgeon de Gerenziot, used the term "cornu ammonis" - the horn of the emon

 Over the years, three main ideas about the role of the hippocampus are mainly in literature: inhibition, memory, and place
 Was made ridiculous as a practical prohibition theory) was very popular until the 1960s
 It was particularly certified by two observations: first, animals in which the hippocampus was damaged were reactive; Secondly, animals with damaged hippocampus often found it difficult to learn the inhibitory response previously taught, especially when responding as they had to remain calm as in the passive avoidance test
 Jeffrey Gray called this thinking Changed to the perfect theory of the role of the hippocampus in a state of yearning
 Currently the principle of prohibition is the least popular of the three ideas

 a third important theory of the function of the hippocampus relates the hippocampus to locality
 The original proponents of spatial theory were o'keefe and Nadel, who were E
C
 Was influenced by Tolman's theory of "cognitive maps" in humans and breast stripes
 In 1971, o'keefe and his student Dostrovsky discovered neurons that showed behavior in mice according to their ecological conditions
 Despite the skepticism of other investigators, o'keefe and his co-workers, particularly Lynn Nadel, continue to solve this problem, culminating in his work towards this in the form of a very influential 1978 book, The Hippocampus as a cognitive map Hui
 There is now a consensus in the theory of memory that spatial coding plays a specific role in the function of the hippocampus, but its detailed details are still a matter of argument

 In severe damage to the hippocampus, there is a lot of difficulty in creating new memories and often it also affects the memories made before this damage
 While this retrograde effect usually extends as early as a few years before brain damage, in some cases it preserves antiquated memories - the escape of these old memories reinforces the idea that memories from the hippocampus over time are associated with brain damage
 Are transferred to other parts

 The discovery of spatial cells in the 1970s led to the theory that the hippocampus acts as a cognitive map - a neural representation of that ecological layout
 The available evidence supports this hypothesis on several grounds
 It is a frequent observation that without a fully active hippocampus, humans cannot remember where they are and how to get to where they are going: straying is the most common symptom of amnesia
 Studies with animals suggest that an intact hippocampus is essential for spatial memory tasks, particularly tasks that involve achieving a hidden goal
 Recent discoveries to the "cognitive map hypothesis", such as head cells, brain imaging se pataa chalata he ki adhik sakriy hippocampus vaale vyakti behatar disha-nirdesan kar pate hai jaisaa ki computer simulation aadhaarit "abhaasi" disha-nirdesan se siddh hua

 According to anatomy, the hippocampus is an extension of the tip of the cerebral cortex
 The structures that line the tip of the cortex, and form the so-called limbic system: these include the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, olfactory cortex, and amygdala
 Paul mclean learned as part of the Triune brain theory that the limbic structure includes the neural underpinnings of emotions
 Some neuroscientists no longer believe in the concept of an integrated "limbic system"
 However, according to the hippocampus anatomy, it is associated with those parts of the brain that are related to emotional behavior - the anterior nuclear complex in the septum, hypothalamic mammary body and thalamus, so its role in the limbic system cannot be ruled out

 The entorhinal cortex located in the parahippocampal gyrus is considered to be part of the hippocampal region due to the anatomy of the anatomy
 The EC is strongly associated with many other parts of the cerebral cortex
 Additionally, the medial septal nucleus, the anterior nucleus complex and the nucleus reunion of the thalamus and the supramammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, as well as the ref nuclei and locus coerulus in the brain base, send axons to the EC
 The main pathway for the clearance of axons of the EC is the large stellate
 Comes from the cells of the pyramidal form that are in layer II and the subiculum Micro "pierce" are and Dentate gyrus and project densely existing Kanika-like cells, CA 3 on the apical dendrites receive less dense projection is, and CA1 and apical dendrites are able to achieve very little projection
 Thus the perforant path establishes the EC as the main "interface" that functions between the hippocampus and other parts of the cerebral cortex
 The dentate corpuscles of the dentate carry the axon information from the EC through thorny spines, which pass through the proximal apical dendrites of CA3 pyramidal-shaped cells
 The CA3 then travels out of the axon cells into the region where the apical dendrites are found, circling, and then progresses to deeper layers of the entorhinal cortex - the Shafer collaterals completing its inverse cycle; Exons from the CA1 area are sent back to the EC, but they are much less than in CA3
 Information sent by the EC within the hippocampus is single-direction, signals are transmitted through the dense layers of the cell, first to the dentate gyrus, then to the CA3 layer, Then the CA1 layer is followed by the subiculum and then the EC outside the hippocampus, and this is mainly due to the close proximity of the CA3 axons
 All these layers have complex internal circuits and large horizontal combinations

 The cortical region adjacent to the hippocampus is collectively called the parahippocampal gyrus
 These include the EC and the perirhinal cortex, its name based on the fact that it is found near the pineal sulcus
 The perirhinal cortex plays an important role in visually identifying complex objects, but there is also evidence that it also contributes to memory and is different from the contribution of the hippocampus, and both hippocampus and parahippocampus for complete amnesia

 Theta mode is displayed during active, alert behavior, also during REM sleep
 In the theta mode, the EEG is overlapped by large and regular waves that have a frequency range of 6 to 9 Hz, and major clusters of hippocampal neurons exhibit low-density activity, meaning that most of the small intervals of time The cells are quiet, while the remaining cells emit at a relatively high level, with the most active cells 50 spikes per They emit for a second
 An active cell usually remains active for half a second to a few seconds
 According to the behavior of mice, the activated cells become calm and new cells become active, but the overall percentage of active cells remains almost the same

 However, on the basis of quality, they have also seen similar strong waves and similar state dependent activity

 During sleep, or during sleep-wake conditions, when the animal is resting or not busy with objects around it, the EEG of the hippocampus shows irregular slow waves, theta waves in amplitude
 Are larger than
 This form is sometimes blocked by very large surges, called intense waves
 These events are accompanied by very intense spike activity, which takes between 50 and 100 milli-seconds and occurs in pyramidal shaped cells of CA3 and CA4
 They are also associated with short-term high-frequency EEG oscillations known as "ripples", a frequency of 150–200 Hz in mice
 Sharp waves are most visible when the animal is in sleep, they appear on average 1 time per party second, but their temporal form is very irregular
 Strong waves give less strength in the inactive state of wake, and in this case they are smaller
 Strong waves are also seen in humans and monkeys
 In Macau, strong waves are strong but not as frequent as in mice

 At least since the time of Ramon y Kejal, psychologists were speculating that brain memory stores storage by changing the strength of contact between concurrently active neurons
 This idea was formalized by Donald Hebb in 1948, but the brain's mechanism for such changes could not be known after many years
 In 1973, Tim Bliss and Terje Lomo explained a phenomenon in the rabbit's hippocampus that justified Hebb's description: a change in synaptic reactivity that was induced by short but powerful activation and for several hours, days, or even more Remained for a long time
 The event was named Clove Term Potential or LTP
 One of the many assumptions proposed for memory, LTP was studied intensively for many years and much information was gathered about it

 Age-related problems such as Alzheimer's disease have a profound effect on many types of cognition, but in normal, healthy aging, some types of memory gradually decline in people, including both contextual memory and working memory
 
 Since the hippocampus plays a central role in memory, it is also of considerable interest that the age-related decline in memory may be due to a decline in the functioning of the hippocampus
 Some early studies have found that neurones in the hippocampus are significantly damaged in older people, but in later studies that were using even more subtle techniques, it was found that very subtle between the two The difference is
 Similarly, some MRI studies have shown that the hippocampus becomes narrower in older people, but other studies have been unable to reproduce this fact
 However, there is a reliable correlation between the size of the hippocampus and memory function — that is, the hippocampus is not constricted in all older people, but in which it may impair performance of some memory functions
 It has also been reported that hippocampal activation is lower in older people than in younger people

 Glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus are present in considerable amounts, making them more sensitive to long-term stress than other parts of the brain
 Stress-related steroids affect the hippocampus in at least three ways: first, it reduces the excitability of some neurons in the hippocampus; Others interrupt the origin of new neurons in the dentate gyrus; Thirdly, it deforms dendrites in pyramidal cells of the CA3 region
 There is evidence to suggest that individuals who have experienced chronic long-term stress stress have greater hippocampal atrophy than any other part of the brain
 These effects are seen in post-traumatic disorder and are associated with schizophrenia and severe stress
 The hippocampus can also cause weathering
 In a recent study, it has been shown that weathering occurs as a result of stress but it can be prevented by an anti-depressant, whether or not an anti-depressant is effective in relieving other symptoms
 Hippocampal weathering is also often seen in Cushing's syndrome, Cushing's syndrome is a type of disorder that is caused by excess of cortisol in the blood
 If the stress is not constant, at least some of these effects appear reversible at this stage
 However, there has been evidence from studies primarily related to mice that stress occurring shortly after birth can affect the functioning of the hippocampus in such a way that those symptoms may remain lifelong

 The causes of schizophrenia have not been understood very clearly, but many irregularities related to the structure of the brain have been reported
 Changes examined most closely include the cerebral cortex but its effects on the hippocampus have also been described
 Several reports have also seen a decrease in the size of the hippocampus of a person with schizophrenia
 These changes are probably due to altered development rather than damaged tissues and are also seen in individuals who have never been given medication for it
 variousneither type of evidence indicates a change in synonymous organization and contact
 It is not clear whether changes in the hippocampus play any role in causing symptoms of mental illness, which is a major symptom of schizophrenia
 Based on research conducted on animals, Anthony Grace and his colleagues suggested that normal functioning of the hippocampus may result in changes in dopamine secretion in the basal ganglia, leading to the integration of information into the prefrontal cortex indirectly
 Will be impressed
 Others suggested that abnormally reacting by the hippocampus may cause long-term memory disturbances, often seen in people with schizophrenia

 The hippocampus usually resembles the same in all mammals, ranging from eggs laying eggs such as Echidna to primary primitives such as humans
 In the hippocampus, the proportion of its size increases with bulk depending on the size of the body, it is about twice as large in the primary primitives as in Echidna
 However, it does not in any way increase the proportion in which this increase occurs in the neocortex
 The hippocampus therefore covers a greater proportion of the cortical covering in rodents than in primary primates
 In adult humans, the spread of both the brain and the hippocampus is approximately 3–3
5 cm3, while in the neocortex, it is 320–420 cm3

 yah sambandh ling ke antar main bhi lagu hota he: un prajatiyon main jahaan sthanik smriti kshamta ke sambandh main nar or maadaa ke bich kaaphi antar hota he, vah tadnusaar hippocampus ke failaav ke antar ko bhi pradarshit karte hai
 The brain structure of non-mammalian species is not the same as that of the hippocampus of mammals, but the brain structure they contain is homologous to mammals
 The hippocampus, as noted above, is essentially the intermediate end of the cortex
 Only mammals have a fully developed cortex, but the structure from which it originated is called the pallium, found in all spinal nerves, even in the most elementary level of spinal cord such as the lampere or hagfish
 The pallium is generally divided into three parts: medial, lateral and dorsal
 The medial pallium forms the anterior part of the hippocampus
 It does not look like the hippocampus because its layers are not distorted in the shape of s or are not engulfed by the dentate gyrus, But by their deep chemical and functional similarities, their homology is indicated
 Now there is also evidence that these hippocampus-like structures are also related to spatial memory in birds, reptiles and fish
 pakshiyon main yah tadnurupata itani spasht hoti he ki sharir rachana ke kai vigyaani "avian hipocampus" naam ke dwaara madhyavarti palial hisse kii ore sanket karte hai
 pakshiyon kii kai prajatiyon main vishisht sthanik kaushal hota he, mukhyatah uname jo bhojan kaa bhandaran karte hai
 is baat ke bhi pramaan maujuud hai ki bhojan kaa bhandaran karne vaale pakshiyon main anya prakaar ke pakshiyon kii tulana main hippocampus kaa aakar bada hota he or hippocampus main hone vaali kshati se iname sthanik smriti kshatigrast ho jaati he
 This fact is even more complicated with respect to fishes
 In teleost fish, the forebrain of the brain is distorted compared to other vertebrates: most neuro anatomists believe that the forebrain of the brain of the teleost fish is necessarily folded, such as the outside of a stocking
 Bend so that the structures at the inner end of most spinal nerves that are located right next to the ventricle St Go found on the outside of the fish, and also vice versa
 One consequence of this is that the medial pallium of an ideal vertebrate is considered to be corresponding to the lateral pallium of an ideal fish
 Based on experiments, it has been shown that many types of fish have specific spatial skill abilities, even the talent to create a "cognition-based map" of the place in which they live
 is prakaar, samudri jivan ke sambandh main hippocampus kshetra kii bhoomika rishadhariyon kii utpatti se bhi kaaphi pehle prarambh hui maaloom padati he, un vikhandanon se bhi pracheen joki saikadon million varshon purv hue the
 yah abhi tak gyaat nahin he ki madhyavarti palium anya praathmik ridh dhariyon main bhi yahi bhoomika nibhaati he yaa nahi
 kuch prakaar ke keet or sip jaise octopus, main bhi vishisht sthanik kaushal or nauvahan kshamtaayen hoti hai, lekin yah stanadhariyon kii sthanik pranali se alag dhang se kaary karti hai, isliye abhi bhi yah sochane ke liye koi paryaapt kaaran nahin he ki inaki utpatti ek hi strot se hui he; naa hi inaki mashtishk sanrachanaon main paryaapt samanta he jisase ki in prajatiyon main "hippocampus" jaise kisi bhi bhaag kii pahchaan ko sahaayta mil sake
 haalanki kuch logon ne yah prastaav diya he ki kiton kii khumbi rupi sanrachana kii karypranali hippocampus ke saamaan ho sakati he

 Rajkamal Prakashan Private Limited is a reputed publishing institution primarily publishing Hindi books
 iskaa mukhyalay netaji subhash maarg, dariyaganj nayi dilli main sthit he
 It is basically a literary publication, but it has also published the best original and translated works of non-literary subjects
 raajakmal prakaashan kii sthapana 28 farvari 1947 ko hui thi
 At that time the country had not become independent, but amidst the apprehension of partition, the knock of freedom was clearly heard
 aise sankraman kaal main desh ke saanskrithik paksh ko majboot karne or hindi bhashaa tathaa samaaj kii asmita ko rekhaankit karne ke sankalp ke saath is prakaashan kii shuruyaat hui thi
 Its founder was the famous Hindi litterateur Dr
 Devraj
 prakaashan kaa vistaar hone par unhone apane bhai omprakash ji ko prakaashan ke sanchaalan hetu bulaayaa or is prakaar omprakash ji raajakmal prakaashan ke prabandh nideshak bane
 Omprakash ji proved to be the real founder of Rajkamal in terms of work
 apni paini sooyeeboojh tathaa lekhakon se sampark saadhane kii kushalta ke bal par unhone alp samay main hi raajakmal ko prakaashan kii unchaaiyon tak pahunchaa diya
 Rajkamal Prakashan has developed into a private limited institution
 yah kisi kii nijee yaa paitruk sampatti ke rup main nahin he, balki iskaa swaamitv sheyaron ke aadhaar par nirdhaarit hota he
 Thus it was initially owned by Aruna Asaf Ali
 kinhin muddon par omprakash ji se matbhed hone par ve is prakaashan ko lekar kathinaayee mahasoos kar rahi thim, tabhi shila sandhu ke pati hardev sandhu ne unase is prakaashan ke adhikansh share kharid liye or bahut-kuch matbhed kii sthiti main hi omprakash ji ke prabandh nideshak pad chhod dene ke baad hindi bhashaa se praayah anbhigya hone ke baavjood shila sandhu ne prabandh nideshak kaa pad sanbhaala
 Omprakash ji opened his independent publishing institute in the name of Radhakrishna Prakashan
 anek lekhakon se unke vyaktigat sambandh the or isliye bhi mohan rakesh jaise pratishthit kai lekhak raajakmal se dur ho gayi
 Sheela Sandhu faced double-triple difficulties, but she did not give up
 shila sandhu ucch shiksha praapt tathaa desh duniya dekhi hui mahila thi, parantu hindi bhashaa tathaa hindi bhashi samudaay se dur hone ke kaaran kathinaaiyaan swaabhaavik thim
 At such a time, Namvar Singh joined Rajkamal Publications as a publishing consultant
 "pehali june, 1965 se namvar ne raajakmal ke samast saahitiyik maamalon kii dekh-rekh kaa puraa daayitv le liya
 In addition to the decision of publication of the book, he was also asked to keep an eye on the policies of 'new stories' and 'criticism' magazines
 " swayan shila sandhu ke shabdon main "is kathin ghadi main namvar singh, jaadui vaktrutv evam adhyaapan style ke maalik, kii salaahkaar kii bhoomika jitani hi raajakmal ke liye jaruri thi utani hi mere liye
 "although his role suddenly raised the problem of partisan and personal politics of literature, but gradually all this was overcome and Rajkamal publication touched the heights
 dow0 namvar singh ne acharya hajaari prasad dvivedi evam dow0 ramvilas sharma ko raajakmal prakaashan se jodne main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Acharya Hazari Prasad Dwivedi's book Charu Chandralekh was already published by Omprakash ji from Rajkamal
 ab namvar singh ke praytn se unki tathaa dow0 ramvilas sharma kii adhikansh pustaken raajakmal prakaashan se prakashit huin
 Sheela Sandhu herself also joined Rajkamal by learning Hindi on the strength of her determination as well as making good connections with many writers
 rajendra singh bedi, upendranath ashk, nemichandra jain, bhishma saahani, bharat bhushan agarwal, nirmala, suresh avasthi, sarveshwar dayaal saxena, nirmal verma, kunwar narayan, prayag, raghuveer sahay, liladhar jagudi, manohar shyaam joshi, abdul bismillah or shrilaal shukla jaise lekhak judate gayi
 Rajkamal Prakashan became established as one of the most successful publishing institutes in the Hindi literature world
 aarambh main logon ko laga tha ki shila sandhu ke raajakmal kaa prabandh nideshak hone se yah prakaashan santhaan band ho jayega or yahan sandhu apana paariwarik vyavsaay motor parts kii dukaan shuru kar degi
 But with her diligence and determination, Sheela Sandhu not only removed this apprehension, but also earned the trust of Sumitranandan Pant, Bhagwati Charan Verma, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Suryakant Tripathi Nirala, Shivamangal Singh Suman, Baba Nagarjuna and Phanishwar Nath Renu
 The type expanded the established fame of Rajkamal
 us samay raajakmal prakaashan kii pustakon kii chapai kaa electronic madhyam se koi vaasta nahin tha
 Sheela Sandhu used to accept handwritten manuscripts
 unhen tip kiya jaataa tha, phir usase letters press main pruf banaaya jaataa or tab lekhak un par apni anushansa dete
 Authors are contacted for book headings, advertisements and covers
 lekhakon ko kabhi bhi unki pustak ke prakaashan kii prakriya main bhaag lene se hatotsahit nahin kiya jaataa tha
 During the meetings of the Indian Publishers Association, Sheela Sandhu also tried to prove to herself that the royalty accounts of the authors can be made transparent by having a close relationship with them
 haalanki prakashkon ke bich yah vichaar lokapriy nahin ho paaya
 At that time, the books of Rajkamal Prakashan did not remain in the computer and there was nothing like printing and selling the same number of copies whenever desired
 ream ke ream kaagajon main chhapakar, bhaade ke godaamon ke milon lambey self main pustak surakshit rakhi jaati thi
 For this, half-yearly accounts, 'raw' lists had to be prepared and sprayed with regular medicines for protection against termites that eat 'lei' of books
 aaj ke yug main ye baaten haasyaaspad lag sakati he parantu us samay ke liye yah satya he
 Mohan Gupta's memorable contribution in the development of this publication
 kolkata se aae mohan gupt ne dhire-dhire sampadan kaa kaarybhaar sanbhaala or phir ve pustak ke sampadan, prakaashan-nirdesan evam mudran-prastutikaran sambandhi sabhi daayitv nibhaane lage
 Sheila Sandhu herself considers him 'one of the best editors and publishing managers of the Hindi publishing world'
 30 varsh tak is prakaashan santhaan ke safal sanchaalan ke baad shila sandhu isse alag huin or san 1994 main ashok maheshwari ne prabandh nideshak kaa pad sanbhaala
 Rajkamal Prakashan is on the path of development as the best publishing institution in Hindi literature world till date
 itnaa jarur he ki pustakon kaa mulya ab pehle kii tarah santulit nahin rahaa he
 Apart from this wild price increase, if there is any difference, it is that in the early period of this publication, Omprakash ji, who is known to the extent of creative and adventurous vision, 'left an indelible impression of excellent quality on Rajkamal publication' which published books
 The form of creativity remains intact even today, but due to the extremely levelless paper used in many books, this The quality of the area has collapsed to a great extent
 kuch hi samay main akhabaari kaagaj se bhi kai guna adhik durdashagrast sthiti main pahunch jane vaala yah motaa par kaaphi halkaa kaagaj raajakmal ke gaurav main nirantar batta laga rahaa he
 Rajkamal Prakashan took the unique initiative to publish the entire works of the best writers in a systematic and authentic manner by qualified editors to publish their compositions
 yojana ke rup main isaki pehali kadi thi hajariprasad dvivedi kii rachanawali, jise unke suputr mukund dvivedi hi sampadit kar rahe the
 Although this Rachnavali was published much later
 sabase pehle prakashit hone vaali rachanawali thi sumitranandan pant rachanawali jiske liye us samay raajakmal prakaashan ko pathakon se prakaashan purv agrim aadesh evam peshgi raashi praapt karne kaa sukhad sanyog mila tha
 After this, Rajkamal has established a record in this field by presenting the compositions of many excellent articles in very excellent form
 yahan se prakashit rachanawaliyon kaa vivaran nimnaankit sarini main drashtavy he- In the field of access to Hindi literature for general readers, Rajkamal created a textual revolution by taking the initiative to present the original book as a paperback edition of books
 aarambh main anek logon ne pathakon main saahitiyik ruchi kaa abhaav kii ashanka jataa kar paperbax kii safalataa par andeh prakat kiya
 But, when the second edition of Muktibodh Rachnavali also came in the form of paperbacks and three quarters of it was sold before publication, its unquestionable success was irrefutably attested
 is paperbax sanskaran ke kaaran gambhir sahitya ke pathakon main atyadhik vruddhi hui or yah prayog puri safalataa ke saath ab anivaaryta kaa rup le chukaa he
 These paperback editions have a double utility
 ek to inaki keemat kam hoti he, duusare is ke aavaran par suprasiddh kalakaaron kii kalakritiyon ke chitra dekar isaki mahatta dwiguneet kar di jaati he
 It was also started by Sheela Sandhu with the help of her second daughter

 For a few years, it was edited by an editorial board, then Nandadulare Vajpayee became associated with its editing and for the longest time the magazine continued to grow under the editing of Namvar Singh

 With his efforts, he appointed Bhairav prasad Gupta as editor for publication of this magazine in January 1960 and after four months of preparations, in May 1960 it got its entry
 bhairav prasad gupt ke elahabaad main hone ke kaaran iskaa prakaashan elahabaad se hi aarambh hua, parantu baad main iskaa prakaashan dilli se hi hone laga tathaa bhairav prasad gupt bhi dilli aa gayi
 Bhairav prasad Gupta edited 'new Stories' till January 1963 and brought it to the pinnacle of achievement both in terms of creative superiority and popularity

 By the sixth digit itself, its circulation had reached seventy five thousand

 In August 1965, with the efforts of Namvar Singh, Bhishma Sahni edited the new stories and he edited it for about two and a half years

 Similarly, once the decision was taken to close the Allahabad branch of Rajkamal, Lok Bharti Prakashan, established at the same place by its immediate in-charge Dinesh Ji, also joined Rajkamal under mutual agreement in 2005 and thus the 'rajkamal Prakashan Group' was formed
