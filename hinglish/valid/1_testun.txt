 Some people were also unhappy with him because of his candidness and hard truth

 Although the term democracy is used in a political context, the principle of democracy is also relevant for other groups and organizations
 multah loktantr bhinn bhinn siddhanton ke mishran se banate hai, par matdaan ko loktantr ke adhikansh prakaaron kaa charitragat lakshan mana jaataa he
 According to the definition of democracy it is "rule by the people, by the people, by the people"
 lekin alag-alag deshkal or paristhitiyon main alag-alag dharanaon ke prayog se isaki avadharana kuch jatil ho gayi he
 Many proposals have been made in the context of democracy since ancient times, but many of them were never implemented
 pratinidhi loktantr main janata sarkari adhikariyon ko sidhe chunati he
 Representatives are elected from a district or parliamentary constituency or represent all voters in several proportional arrangements
 kuch deshon main mishrit vyavastha prayukt hoti he
 Although representatives in such a democracy are elected by the people, the representatives themselves decide the policies to act in the public interest
 yadhyapi dalgat nitiyaan, matadaataaon main chhavi, punah chunaav jaise kuch kaarak pratinidhiyon par asar daalate hai, kintu saamanytah inamen se kuch hi badhyakaari anudesh hote hai
 The greatest feature of this system is that the mandate pressure acts to curb policy deviations, as elections are mandatory for the legitimacy of power at regular intervals
 ek tarah kaa pratinidhi loktantr he, jisamen svachh or nishpaksh chunaav hote hai
 Characteristic features of liberal democracy include security of minorities, law and order, distribution of powers, etc
 Freedom of expression, language, assembly, religion and property are prominent
 pratyaksh loktantr main sabhi naagarik saare mahatvapurn nitigat faislon par matdaan karte hai
 It is called direct because in principle it has no representative or mediator
 sabhi pratyaksh loktantr chote samudaay yaa nagar-rashtron main hai
 Example - Switzerland pracheen kaal me bharat main sudrudh vyavastha vidyaman thi
 We find evidence of this from ancient literature, coins and inscriptions
 videshi yatriyon evam vidwaanon ke varnan main bhi is baat ke pramaan hai
 The electoral system for the ruler and other officials of government was the same as in the ancient republican system
 yogyata evam gunon ke aadhaar par inke chunaav kii prakriya aaj ke daur se thodi bhinn jarur thi
 Not all citizens had the right to vote
 rugveda tathaa kautilya sahitya ne chunaav paddati kii pushti kii he parantu unhone vot dene ke adhikaar par roshni nahin daali he
 Like the present Parliament, councils were formed in ancient times which resembled the present parliamentary system
 ganraajya yaa sangh kii nitiyon kaa sanchaalan inhen parishadon dwaara hota tha
 Its members were huge
 us samay ke sabase prasiddh ganraajya lichhavi kii kendriya parishad main 7707 sadsy the
 At the same time, there were 5000 members of the Central Council of Yudayya

 Before any issue was decided, it was openly discussed among the members
 sahi-galat ke akalan ke liye paksh-vipaksh par joardaar bahes hoti thi
 Only then a unanimous decision was rendered
 sabaki sahmati na hone par bahumat prakriya apanaayi jaati thi
 In many places it was mandatory to have consensus
 bahumat se liye gayi nirnay ko ‘bhooyisikkim’ kaha jaataa tha
 Voting had to be resorted to
 tatkaaleen samay main vot ko 'chand' kaha jaataa tha
 Like the Election Commissioner, there was an officer overseeing this election called 'shalakagrahaka'; Used to say vot dene ke liye teen pranaliyaan thim- Esoteric - that is, by writing your vote on a letter in which the name of the person who voted was not known
 vivruthak – is prakriya main vyakti sambandhit vishay ke prati apane vichaar sabake saamne prakat karata tha
 That is, open public announcement
 sankarnajalpak - sadsy in teenon main se koi bhi ek prakriya apnaane ke liye swatantra the
 The chalakagrahaka used to calculate these votes with complete promptness and honesty
 is tarah ham pate hai ki pracheen kaal se hi hamaare desh main gauravshaalee loktantreey parampara thi
 Apart from this, a number of ministries were also created to govern orderly governance
 uttam gunon evam yogyata ke aadhaar par in mantralayon ke adhikariyon kaa chunaav kiya jaataa tha
 The major departments of the ministries were- audyogic tathaa shilp sambandhi vibhaag State Department janaganana Determination of rules of sale and purchase mantrimandal kaa ullekh hamen arthshaastra, manusmriti, shukraniti, mahabharat, ityadi main praapt hota he
 In the Yajurveda and Brahmin texts, they were called 'ratni'
 mahabharat ke anusaar mantrimandal main 6 sadsy hote the
 According to Manu, the number of members was 7-8
 shukr ne iske liye 10 kii sankhya nirdhaarit kii thi
 Their functions were as follows: - purohit- yah raja kaa guru mana jaataa tha
 This position was given only to a person skilled in both politics and religion
 uparaj - iskaa kaary raja kii anupasthiti main shashan vyavastha kaa sanchaalan karnaa tha
 pradhan-pradhan or Prime Minister was the most important member of the Cabinet
 vah sabhi vibhaagon kii dekhbhaal karata tha
 Secretary- Like the present defense minister, his job was to look after the security related work of the state

 Chanakya called this a competence
 amaatya- amaatya kaa kaary sampurna rajya ke prakritik sansadhano kaa niyaman karnaa tha
 Envoy - Like the present-day intelligence, the job of the envoy was to organize the intelligence department
 yah rajya kaa atyant mahatvapurn evam samvedansheel vibhaag mana jaataa tha
 Apart from these, there were many departments
 itnaa hi nahin vartmaan kaal kii tarah hi panchayat vyavastha bhi hamen apane desh main dekhne ko milti he
 Villages were considered the basic unit of governance
 prayek gaanv main ek gram-sabha hoti thi
 The administration system of the village, from the judicial system to every welfare work of the village was carried out
 inkaa kaary gaanv kii prayek samasya kaa nipataara karnaa, aarthik unnati, raksha kaary, samunnat shashan vyavastha kii sthapana kar ek adarsh gaanv taiyaar karnaa tha
 The head of the Gram Sabha was called Gramani
 sara rajya choti-choti shashan ikaayiyon main banta tha or prayek ikai apane main ek chote rajya si thi or sthanik shashan ke nimitt apane main purna thi
 The governing power of the entire state was under one assembly, whose members were the heads of those governing units
 ek nishchit kaal ke liye sabakaa ek mukhya athwa adhyaksh nirvaachit hota tha
 If the assembly was large, an executive committee consisting of some of its members was elected
 yah shashan vyavastha athens main clysthenij ke samvidhan se milti-julati thi
 There were people of all ages, young and old in the meeting
 unki baithak ek bhawan main hoti thi, jo sabhaagaar kehalaata tha
 According to an ancient mention, the culprit was first presented to an officer named 'vinichayamahatram' for consideration
 nirparaadh hone par abhiyukt ko vah mukt kar saktaa tha par dand nahin de saktaa tha
 Used to send him to a higher court than himself

 There were many republics in the country

 But after the fall of the Maurya Empire, some new democratic states were born
 yatha yodhey, maanav or arjuniyan ityadi
 The details of some of the major republics of ancient India are as follows: - shakya- shakya ganraajya vartmaan basti or gorakhpur jila ke kshetra main sthit tha
 The capital of this republic was Kapilavastu
 yah saat deevaaron se ghira hua sundar or surakshit nagar tha
 There were eighty thousand total and five lakh people in this union

 There were two committees for governance

 The second eight-member committee administered the administration

 There were three types of experts in this system - decision-making, practical and formulaic
 lichhavi ganraajya tatkaaleen samay kaa bahut shaktishaalee rajya tha
 Repeated attacks were made on it
 antat: magadharaj ajatshatru ne is par akraman karke ise nasht kar diya
 But in the fourth century AD, it again became a powerful republic
 vajji- lichhavi, videh, kundgram ke gyaatruk gana tathaa anya paanch chote ganraajyon ne milakar jo sangh banaaya usee ko vajji sangh kaha jaataa tha
 The ruler of Magadha continued to attack it

 In this republic, the armies of Alexander fought strongly

 Apart from these, the republics of Arishta, Autumvar, Kath, Kunind, Kshudraka, Patanaprastha, etc
 are also found in the ancient Ganths
 prayek rajya chaahe vah udaaravaadi ho yaa samaajawaadee yaa samyavaadee, yahaan tak ki sena ke general dwaara shasit pakistan kaa adhinayakawadi bhi apane ko loktantric kahata he
 To be honest, in today's era, claiming to be democratic has become a fashion
 loktantr kii purnatah sahi or sarvamaanya paribhaasha dena kathin he
 Cranston has rightly said that there are different perceptions regarding democracy
 linset kii paribhaasha adhik vyapak prathit hoti hai uske anusaar, “loktantr ek aisi raajnneetik pranali he jo padaadhikariyon ko badal dene ke niyamit sanvidhanik avasar pradaan karti he or ek aise rachanaatantr kaa praavdhaan karti he jiske tahat jansankhya kaa ek vishaal hissaa raajnneetik prabhaar praapt karne ke icchhuk pratiyogiyon main se manonukool chayan kar mahatvapurn nirnyon ko prabhavit karti he
 Defining democracy, mcpherson considered it 'the only constructive system in which governments are elected and authorized or laws are made and decided in some other form
 ‘ shoopter ke anusaar, ‘loktantric vidhi raajnneetik nirnay lene hetu aisi sansthagat vyavastha he jo janata kii saamaanya ichha ko kriyanvit karne hetu tatpar logon ko chaynit kar saamaanya hit ko saadhane kaa kaary karti he
 In fact, democracy is basically a system associated with participatory politics for civil and political freedom
 loktantr kii avadharana ke sambandh main pramukh siddhanth nimnlikhit hai: Concepts such as freedom, equality, rights, secularism and justice occupy a prominent place in the liberal tradition of democracy, and liberal thinkers have been advocating democracy as the best system to embody these concepts from the beginning
 nripatiyon or saamanti prabhuon se mukti ke baad samaaj ke shashan-sanchaalan kii drushti se loktantr ko swaabhaavik raajnneetik pranali ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya
 macpherson says that concepts like selection politics, competitive polity and market polity had developed even before the advent of democracy in the Western world
 hakeekat main is arth main udaar rajya kaa hi loktantrikaran ho gaya, na ki loktantr kaa udaarikaran
 The early signs of democratic sentiment can be found in the literature of British thinkers such as Tomsmoor and Winstanley and in the literature of British Extremism, but the true beginning of democratic sentiment began with the birth of the principle of social contract, because the inherent sense of social contract of citizens is the same for all individuals
 Equality
 thomas hobbs ne apni pustak ‘leviathan‘ main pramukh loktantric siddhanth kii vakaalat karte hue likhaa ki sarkaar kaa nirmaan janata dwaara ek saamaajik sanvida ke tahat hota he
 John Locke said that government should be done by the public and for his own benefit
 adam smith ne mukt bazaar kaa pratimaan is loktantric aadhaar par hi prastut kiya ki prayek vyakti ko utpaadan karne, kharidne or bechney kii swatantraaa he
 The famous utilitarian philosophers Mill and Bentham fully supported democracy and provided it with an effective intellectual foundation through utilitarianism
 unke anusaar, loktantr upyogetavaad arthath adhiktam logon ke adhiktam sukh ko adhiktam sangrakshan pradaan karata he, kyonki log apane shaskaon se tathaa ek duusare se sangrakshan kii apeksha rakhte hai or is sangrakshan ko sunishchit karne ke sarvottam tareeke hai, pratinidhimulak loktantr, sanvaidhanik sarkaar, niyamit chunaav, gupt matdaan, pratiyogi daleey raajnneeti or bahumat ke dwaara shashan
 J

 Mill added another point to Bentham's argument in favor of democracy, stating that democracy contributes more to the moral development of mankind than any other system of governance
 uski drushti main loktantr naitik atmotthana or vaiyaktik kshamtaaon ke vikaas evam vistaar kaa sarvocch madhyam he
 In this connection, it is noted that neither Bentham and Mill had any universal adult suffrage or one person favored one vote
 1802 tak bentham ne simit matadhikaar kii vakaalat kii or 1809 main sirf sampann virgon ke grihaswamiyon ke liye simit matadhikaar kaa naaraa diya or antatogatva 1817 main saarvbhaum matadhikaar kaa aahvaan kiya, lekin is adhikaar ko mardon tak hi simit rakhaa
 Similarly, Mill was also not in favor of universal adult suffrage, as he feared that the people of one class could maintain their dominance by being a majority and could only legislate their own interests against the interests of other classes
 aage chalakar usne apni pustak ‘ripregententive government‘ main usne kuch logon ke liye ek se adhik matdaan kii vakaalat kii lekin khayraat paane vaale akinchanon, niraksharon, diwaaliyon, kar nahin chukaane waalon ko, arthath un sabhi logon ko jo sanyukt rup se shramik varg kaa nirmaan karte hai, isse vanchit rakhaa
 He was only a supporter of a representative government that does not interfere with basic commonalities and follows a policy of free market and intervention
 baad ke udaaravaadi vichaarak loktantr kaa samarthan karte rahe or pashchimi europe tathaa uttari america ne isaki sweekaaryata ko or aage badhaane kaa kaam kiya
 The archaic liberal view of democracy has been challenged by many thinkers from time to time
 prathamtah, loktantr kii is manyata par prashn khadey kiye gaye hai ki prayek vyakti yah jaanata he ki uske liye sarvottam kya he
 Thinkers such as Lord Bryce, Graham Walls etc
 believe that man is not as judicious, neutral, knowledgeable or active as he is supposed to be for the operation of democracy
 dwitiyatah, loktantr janata ke shashan kii aadharshila par tikaa hota he, kintu yah spashtatah batalaana aasaan nahin he ki ‘shashan‘ or ‘janata‘ ke bilkul sahi arth kya he
 Hence Lokmat as the basis of government is a myth
 tritiytah loktantr se apeksha kii jaati he ki vah saamaanya hit kaa kaam karegaa, lekin saamaanya hit jaisi koi cheez nahin bhi ho sakati he
 The common interest in any society can hold different meanings for different people
 chaturthatah, puraatan udaaravaadi siddhanth samooh manovigyaan, samuhik utpeedan or pratyaayan tathaa janottejak netritv jaise karkon kii upeksha kar detaa he
 Fifthly, in democracy the party system often becomes a game of elite or controlled by those who are resourceful and they decide on important issues
 phir, niti-nirdhaaran kii prakriya bhi kaaphi jatil he
 Liberals have unduly considered it to be simple, transparent and just
 or sabase badi truti is siddhanth main yah he ki yah raajnneetik samanta kintu aarthik vishmata par aadhaarit he
 In the twentieth century, political thinkers began to raise the question whether the masses can play a role in politics in everyday life? Can ordinary citizens, who are engaged in earning their livelihood, invest time and power to play a political role? Will freedom be destroyed if the people openly display their feelings through electoral democracy without any restrictions? In answer to these questions, aristocratic and pluralistic principles of democracy have developed
 abhijan pad kaa prayog kisi samooh ke aise alpsankhyak varg ke liye hota he jo kuch karkon kii vajah se samudaay main vishisht haisiyat rakhte hai
 It takes place in a leading role in the distribution of power in a minority class society
 raajnneetik shreshthivarg, presnts ke anusaar, saamudayik maamalon main apane sankhya-bal ke anupaat main kahin zyada satta kaa upbhog karata he
 The emergence of the aristocracy in the context of democracy occurred after World War II, among the promoters of this theory are Wilfredo Pareto, Gratanomowska, Robert Michels, and American authors James Barnham and C
 Wright Mills
 is siddhanth kaa mukhya aadhaar yah manyata he ki samaaj main do tarah ke log hote hai- gine chune vishisht leg or vishaal jansamooh
 Distinguished people always reach the summit because they are the best people with all the qualifications
 abhijan varg vishesh rup se raajnneetik abhijan varg, saare raajnneetik krityon kaa nishpaadan karata he, satta par ekadhikaar kar letaa he or satta se jude saare laabh uthaata he
 The majority group is arbitrarily controlled and guided by the elite
 sangathit alpsankhyak hi hameshaa asangathit jansamooh ko shasit or nirdeshit karata he
 Robert Michels has used the phrase 'iron law of oligarchy' to say that the general classes must accept the subjugation of the elite class because a large section of the population is indifferent and incompetent in self-rule
 loktantr ke abhijan siddhanth kii mukhya visheshtaye hai : The well-known rendering of the elitist theory of democracy was first done by Joseph Schumpeter in his book 'capitalism, Socialism and Democracy'
 baad main sartori, robert daal, ikstine, remand aron, karl main hiyumond, sidney varba aadi ne apni rachanaaon main is mat kaa samarthan kiya
 This concept of democracy is based on the belief that the vast majority of the population is inefficient and neutral and that they elect some people based on merit and ability who control and govern the political party
 bahusankhyak log jeevika kamaane main vyast rahete hai
 They have neither interest nor understanding in political matters
 isliye ve abhijanvarg se kuch logon kaa chayan kar lete hai or unke anuyaayi ban jate hai
 According to the elitist theory, expertise is essential for efficiency in today's complex society and the number of experts is always small
 atah rajnatik netritv aise chuninda sakasham logon ke haath main hona aavashyak he
 This theory also considers the extreme participation of people as dangerous, because a powerful leader like dictator, Hitler, can mobilize the masses to destroy power and end democracy, which means the end of fundamental freedoms
 isliye unka daawa he ki loktantric or udaaravaadi mulyon ko bachaae rakhane ke liye jansamooh ko raajnneeti se alag rakhana jaruri he
 According to the eligibility principle, there cannot be actual rule by the general public
 shashan hameshaa janata ke liye hota he, janata ke dwaara kabhi nahi, kyonki janata jinhen pratinidhi chunati he ve abhijanvarg ke hi hote hai
 In other words, democracy means the rivalry among the elite classes and the decision by the public as to which elite will rule above
 is prakaar, loktantr maatr ek aisi karypranali he jiske dwaara chote samoohon main se ek janata ke newnatakam atirikt samarthan se shashan karata hai abhijanvaadee siddhanth yah bhi maanata he ki abhijan virgon- raajnneetik dalon, netaaon, bade vyapaaree gharaanon ke karypalkon, svaichhik sanghathanon ke netaaon or yahaan tak ki shramik sanghathanon ke bich mataiky aavashyak he taaki loktantr kii aadharbhoot karypranali ko gaiyr jimmdar netaaon se bachaaya ja sake
 This makes it clear that the elitist class theory externally claims to make the idea of democracy more pragmatic and empirical, but ultimately it transforms democracy into a conservative political theory that is satisfied with liberal or neo-liberal status quoism Gets and wants to maintain its durability
 abhijanwaad kii kai vichaarkon ne aalochana kii he jinamein si
 bi
 macmmersan, greem dancan, bairi holden, robert daal aadi pramukh hai
 The following are the main objections against this principle: loktantr kaa bahulwaadi siddhanth bhi jan saamaanya ke badale samoohon kii bhoomika par bal detaa he
 Some thinkers have represented such principles related to democracy which are a mixture of aristocratic principles and pluralistic principles
 lekin yah bhi sahi he ki bahulwaadi siddhanth kii utpatti abhijan siddhanth kii aanshik pratikriya ke rup main hui he
 The elitist theory is satisfied with the creation of a situation in which power lies in the elites who make important decisions, but the pluralist insists on a system that will nullify the tendency of elitism in liberal democracies and reveal the right publicity 
 bahulwaad kii avadharana vaise to puraani he, kintu beesvin sadi main aadhunik udaaravaadi chintan kaa yah ek mahatvapurn ang ban gaya
 In general, pluralism propagates and decentralizes power in lieu of limiting it to a small group in society
 aadhunik audyogic or praudyogic kaal main, bahulawaadiyon ke anusaar, satta vikhandit ho gai he or isamen pratiyogi saarvajanik or nijee samoohon kii saajhedaari bad gai he
 People in high places no longer hold power like in the past, mainly because they began to play the role of mediator between conflicting interests
 vibhinn samooh apane netritv ke madhyam se madhyasthata karte hai or iske jariye vyakti kaa bhi pratinidhitiv ho jaataa he
 Although power has become concentrated among a few individuals due to industrial and technological integration and technological considerations, competition among minority but larger, interest groups goes in favor of public interest
 bade vyapaaree gharaanon, shram or sarkaar ke bich pratiyogita ne prayek samooh ko apni satta kaa durupyog karne par lagaam kasi he
 Thus, inequality in property, education and power among citizens is less affected as organizations and groups provide more representation than expected and this makes democracy more real and in this sense more viable
 bharat kaa hi udhaaharan len
 Here, the farmer organization of Mahendra Singh Tikait and the Narmada Bachao Andolan are such people's movements that become the voice of millions of poor and uneducated people
 or loktantr ko nishchay hi adhik vaastavik banaate hai
 It is true that the elites and their news media criticize them and call them a hindrance to progress and sometimes even the Supreme Court forces them to stop their movements, but in spite of all this, such mass movements make Indian democracy more meaningful

 Among its proponents is S

 Lancet, Robert Dal, V

 are prominent
 unka tark he ki raajnneetik satta utani saral nahin he jitani dikhaai padati he, yah vibhinn samoohon, sanghathanon, virgon or sanghon samet abhijan varg jo aamtaur par samaaj ko netritv pradaan karata he ke bich banty hui he
 Different selfish groups present their demands directly, but also through various political parties
 bahulwaadi loktantr kii ek paribhaasha is prakaar di gai he
 It is a political system in which policies are determined by mutual consultation and exchange of ideas between different groups because no group or elite is so strong that it can put enough pressure on the government alone to meet all its demands
 Could complete
 bahulwaadi satta kii is saajhedaari kaa anumodan karte hai ki isse laabh yah hota he ki koi bhi saamaajik samooh sarkaar kii niti- nirdhaaran kii prakriya par is kadar haaavee nahin ho paata ki vah anya virgon ke hiton kii andekhi kar sake
 But, there was also a belief of pluralist theorists that all citizens have the legal opportunity and economic resources to organize and pursue their interests in the political arena
 is avasar ke bagaiyr nagarik kisi prastaavit kadam kaa samarthan yaa virodh nahin kar sakate
 Pluralist thinkers consider politics to be a process of determination between groups rather than individuals, and declare that democracy works best only when citizens join groups supporting their special interests
 ve is baat par vishesh bal dete hai ki kisi samaaj main vyaktiyon kii sakriy sahabhaagita honi chahie or apane sankalp ko kriyanvit karne ke liye vibhinn samoohon se jud janaa chahie
 At the same time, all groups and their members must accept that elections are an effective weapon of participation of the larger community in political decisions
 isi tarah, abhijan varg ke saare samooh or sadsy parsparik pratiyogita ke dwaara loktantr ko sambhav banaate hai
 It is clear from this that the pluralistic theory does not really completely oppose elitism because according to its promoters, the existence of elite class is a reality and they are satisfied with its location
 yahi kaaran he ki bahulwaadi siddhanton kabhi-kabhaar abhijanvarg siddhanton se aanshik rup main hi bhinn samajha jaataa he
 The great American political thinker Robert Dal combines his elitist and pluralist notions of democracy and calls his democratic conception as a great system
 uske anusaar, janata samoohon or abhijanvarg ke raajnneetigyon donon ke madhyam se sakriy hoti he
 It has cited many communities that influence the policy making of the government - eg, business houses and industrialists, merchants, labor organizations, farmer organizations, consumers, voters, etc
 aisa nahin he ki unki puri kaarysoochee kriyanvit ho hi jaati he
 Not all groups are equally strong, and many groups are more effective at stopping hostile policies than persuading them to have their own policies 
 bahulwaadi sinddhanth ke viruddh uthaai jane vaali aapattiyon main nimnlikhit pramukh hai: Participation in political activity is the core of democracy, but in capitalist democracies, it is often limited to voting in elections
 loktantr kaa sahabhaagita siddhanth sanwarddhit bhagidaari ko ek adarsh bhi maanata he or krutyaatmak aavashyaktaa bhi
 Prominent proponents of this theory include Carole Perlman, CB since the 1960s
 mcpherson and N
 Left-wing thinkers like Paul Jas have been prominent
 sahabhaagi loktantr kii do pramukh visheshtaayen nimnlikhit hai: According to the principles of participatory democracy, if the task of making policy decisions is confined only to the elite, then the real nature of its democracy is disrupted
 isliye ve isamen aam aadmi kii sahabhaagita kii vakaalat karte hai
 They believe that if the democratic rights are confined to the pages of the paper or the articles of the constitution, then those rights have no meaning, hence the actual consumption of those rights by ordinary people is necessary
 lekin yah upbhog bhi tabhi sambhav he jabaki vyakti swatantra or samaan ho
 If people believe that opportunities for effective participation in policy decisions are not really present, then they will definitely become participants
 aisi sthiti main ve prabhavi dhang se saajhedaari bhi kar sakenge
 The democracy in which it is dominated by political or technical or democratic elite, is not satisfactory to the citizens and the people can end the class domination only through participation
 sahabhaagita siddhanth ke samarthakon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki aaj ke audyogic or praudyogic samaajon main shiksha kaa str unchaa ho gaya he or bauddhik tathaa rajnatik chetana se sampann samaaj main abhijan or gaiyr-abhijan ke bich kii khai kam hui he
 Therefore, participation of ordinary people is not a hindrance in most of the cases in terms of efficiency and development
 sach poocha jaae to satta kaa vikirnan hi atyaachaar ke viruddh sabase majboot suraksha-kavach he
 Only a democracy based on participation can protect citizens from neutrality, ignorance and isolation and can fulfill the basic needs of democracy
 prashn he, aam naagarik kii raajnneetik sahabhaagita kaise ho ? iske siddhantakaaron ne iske nimnlikhit tareeke bataae hai: mcpherson remarks that today's nations are vast in terms of region and population, and it is not possible that all citizens are involved in the political discourse or policy-making of the Rosemary, yet if certain conditions are accepted then the participation ratio is certain Can be increased ye sharte hai: David Held objected to the participatory principle, saying that it is better than the archaic / elite pluralist theories, but it is unclear how and why only the higher levels of participatory human development, which is an important goal of democracy, Will be able to achieve is baat kaa koi sakshya athwa tark sangat aadhaar nahin miltaa ki sahabhaagita nagarikon ko saamaanya hit ke prati adhik sahyogshil or patibaddh banaaegi
 Held also does not necessarily hold the central belief that ordinary people want to be more responsible in policy making and decision making on issues affecting their lives
 yadi ve saamaajik-aarthik maamalon or nitiyon ke nirdhaaran main bhaag lenaa nahin chahen to unhen iske liye baadhya karnaa uchit nahin mana ja saktaa
 Nevertheless, if the common people want to take their democratic tendencies beyond a threshold and start to interfere in the matter of basic freedom and rights, then what questions of democracy will happen, the supporters of the participation theory did not pay enough attention to such questions
 is
 cook or morgan ke anusaar sahabhaagi loktantr ko asli jama pehanaanaa utana aasaan nahin he jitna upree taur par prathit hota he
 For example, what should be the size and function of the participating unit, then how will the decisions taken at the local levels on the basis of active participation of citizens be coordinated and integrated with the interest of the entire nation? The policy matters of one local partner unit may be hostile to the other unit as well
 phir ek baat yah bhi he ki adhiktam sambhav sahabhaagita ke bal par liye gaye nirnay aavashyak nahin ki sarvaadhik kargar nirnay hon hi
 Supporters of participatory theory do not pay enough attention to issues of efficiency and effectiveness
 aam dharna ke vipareet loktantr ke vichaar ko marks or pashchavarti marxvaadi vichaarkon ne bhi sweekaar kar liya he
 So much so that their democracy-related conception is completely different from western liberal democratic conceptions
 chunki marxvaadiyon kaa maananaa he ki poonjivadi vyavastha main loktantric adhikaar sahi arth main aam janata ke paas na hokar sirf saadhan-sampann varg ke haath main hota he, isliye ve ek aise loktantr kii sthapana chaahate hai jo ‘janata kaa loktantr‘ ho
 In Marxist democracy, socialist democracy is established after the abolition of ownership over the means of production and controlling the economy by the proletariat
 marks udaaravaadi sanvaidhanik loktantr kaa aalochak tha kyonki uske anusaar poonjivadi loktantr kaa aadhaar ek aisi aarthik pranali hoti he jisamen utpaadan ke saadhan hameshaa puunjipati varg ke niyantran main hote hai
 This bourgeoisie keeps the government and the state system under its power by keeping it under the control of the political system
 rajya satta, adhikaar or visheshadhikaar purnatah usee varg ke paas hote hai or shramikvarg ke paas sirf naam kii swatantraaa or adhikaar hote hai
 The official class of the state, the court and the police force are also not the neutral but seekers of the sovereign class
 isliye, loktantr ek aisi shashan-pranali kaa rup akhriyaar kar letaa he jo shaasha varg kii satta or visheshadhikaar ko badhaava dene or ucch varg ke hiton ko saadhane ke kaam aata he
 In spite of this, Marx and Engels have accepted that even the moderate bourgeois democracy controlled by the thriving bourgeoisie can to some extent make historical claims to give real rights to its citizens and the working class can use it to organize the revolution of the proletariat
 can do
 udaaravaadi loktantron main aam matadhikaar kaa upyog sarvharavarg kii krantikari aandolan kii prishthbhumi taiyaar karne main kiya ja saktaa he
 Marxists certainly believe that violent revolutionary movements may not be required in some situations, but the possibility of such situations is slim
 agar samaajawaadee kranti ke lakshya ko puraa karne ke liye sansadeey maarg apanaaya bhi jaataa he to yah anya prakaar ke sangharshon main ek atirikt sahaayak upkaran hi ho saktaa he
 According to Marxist analysis, real democracy is possible only after the proletarian revolution to uphold the dictatorship of the proletariat, because the ideal of liberal bourgeois democracy can be of participation, but in reality the participation of the resourceless working class is not there
 apni rachana ‘da critic of da gotha program‘ main marks or angels ne apni avadharana ko spasht karte hue likhaa tha ‘poonjivadi or samyavaadee samaaj ke bich main hi ek kaa duusare main roopantaran kii avadhi nihit hoti he
 Corresponding to this is a period of political transition in which the state has distinguished between totalitarianism and communism of the proletariat
 ve ise ek madhyavarti kaal maanate hai
 This results in the establishment of a communist society
 yah samajhnaa jaruri he ki karl marks or angenles ne adhinayakawad pad kaa prayog kis arth main kiya he
 In his view, each state has been the authoritarianism of the ruling social class
 poonjivadi vyavastha main yah varg sampann audyogic or vyapaaree burjua kaa tha jabaki unki apni avadharana vaala rajya kranti ke turant baad sarvhaara ke niyantran vaala rajya hoga or tab samaajawaadee punanirmaan kii prakriya shuru hogi jiskaa ant ek vargaheen samaaj kii sthapana main hoga
 Therefore, in his view, democracy and proletarian totalitarianism will run simultaneously, just as liberal democracy in the capitalist system is practically democracy and also the totalitarian ruler of the bourgeoisie of industrialists and business houses
 isiilie, marks or angels kaa kahana tha ki kranti or shramik varg ke aadhipaty ke pashchaat kii pranali ‘janata ke loktantr‘ kii pranali hogi
 He meant the mass population of the masses in place of a handful of rich bourgeoisie
 marks dwaara pratipaadit ‘janata kaa loktantr‘ kii pramukh visheshtaayen nimnlikhit hai The creation of socialist societies further enhanced Marxist ideas, Lenin who established the first socialist state in Russia in 1917 introduced new interpretations of Marxist thought
 usne sarvhaara ke adhinayakawad ko sweekaar kiya or samaajawaadee kranti ke iske mahatva par bal diya, lekin usne iske saath yah bhi jod diya ki sarvhaara varg kaa adhinayakawad vishaal sarvhaara sanghathan yaa samyavaadee dal dwaara hi prayog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 He described three stages of democracy: capitalist democracy, socialist democracy and communist democracy
 uske anusaar loktantr rajya kaa ek swaroop he or varg-vibhajit samaaj main sarkaar adhinayakawadi or loktantric donon hoti he
 It is democracy for one class and totalitarianism for another
 burjua varg chunki apane hit saadhan main poonjivadi pranali ko niyantrit or sanchalit karata he, isliye use satta se bedakhalkar samaajawaadee loktantr ko sthapit karnaa aavashyak he
 Lenin acknowledges that the newly established socialist state is as oppressive as the capitalist state
 sarvhaara varg ke shashan ko lagu karne ke liye yah aavashyak bhi he
 Since the bourgeoisie is very powerful, it becomes necessary for the proletariat to abolish the capitalist class by force in the early stages of socialist democracy
 sarvhaara ke adhinayakawad ke samaksh do lakshya hote hai: According to Lenin, this task is mainly done by the communist party
 is tarah, lenin kii drushti main poonjivadi loktantr main sachcha loktantr nahin hota, jabaki sarvhaara ke adhinayakawad main purvaapeksh adhik loktantr hota he, kyonki yah bahusankhyak sarvhaara varg kaa shashan he
 He also claimed that eventually democracy would become unnecessary with the realization of true communism, as it would have no meaning in the context of that society
 marks, angels or lenin ke baad anek vichaarkon ne marxvad kii anek vyakhyaayein prastut kii he
 Among them are Edward Bernstein, Karl Cotsky, Rosa Lukjamvarg, etc
 edward bernstin kaa daawa he ki poonjeevaad kii marxvaadi vyakhya galat he or sarvhaara kaa adhinayakawad na to aavashyak he, na vaanchhneeya
 According to him, political democracy and liberal freedoms are more important
 lenin kii yah manyata sahi nahin he ki sarvhaara kaa adhinayakawad aavashyak he
 Bernstein argues that until the proletariat attains majority, socialist revolution is impossible and totalitarianism is no longer needed if it achieves majority
 uske anusaar loktantr aavashyak he or marxvaadi samaajawaadee siddhanth ke saath loktantric parampara ko jodakar hi samaajwaad kii sthapana ho sakati he
 Raising the objection to Lenin's anti-democracy policy, Marxist revolutionary Rosa Luxembourg has said that it establishes totalitarianism over a large population, not the dictatorship of the vast masses
 • bahusankhyak janasamudaay, jo gaiyr-abhijanvarg kaa nirmaayak he, main adhikansh bhavashunya, aalsee or udasin hote hai, isliye ek aisa alpsankhyak varg kaa hona aavashyak he jo netritv pradaan kare
 According to the eligibility principle, expertise is essential for efficiency in today's complex society and the number of experts is always small
 atah rajnatik netritv aise chuninda sakasham logon ke haath main hona aavashyak he
 • Democracy is simply a mechanism by which one of the small groups governs with minimal support from the public
 The elitist theory also believes that the elite classes - political parties, leaders, executives of big business houses, leaders of voluntary organizations and here It is necessary to have a consensus among the labor organizations so that the basic functioning of democracy is determined by non-responsible leaders

 True democracy can be created only when citizens are politically active and continue to take a keen interest in collective problems

 • According to the principles of participatory democracy, if the task of making policy decisions is confined only to the elite, then the real nature of its democracy is disrupted
 isliye ve isamen aam aadmi kii sahabhaagita kii vakaalat karte hai
 They believe that if the democratic rights are confined to the pages of the paper or the articles of the constitution, then those rights have no meaning, hence the actual consumption of those rights by ordinary people is necessary
 • loktantr rajya kaa ek swaroop he or varg-vibhajit samaaj main sarkaar adhinayakawadi or loktantric donon hoti he
 It is democracy for one class and totalitarianism for another

 There are mainly two types of semiconductor devices based on construction - stand alone devices and integrated circuits
 ardhchaalak padaarthon kaa sabase mahatvapurn aakarshan he ke inhe dooshit kar inke vyavhaar ko niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 This process of corruption is called doping
 ardhchalkon ke chaalan ko vaidyut kshetra, roshni, ooshmaa, yahan tak dabaav se bhi niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, semiconductors are used to make sensors
 vidyutdhara kaa pravaah hota he "mukt" electron or "chhidron" ke dwaara, jinhe aavesh vaahak bhi kehete he
 a semiconductor such as silicon is doped by adding elements such as phosphorus or boron, greatly increasing the amount of free electrons or holes available in the semiconductor
 jab dooshit ardhchaalak main adhiksham chhidr hoten hai to use P-prakaar ardhchaalak kehate hai or jab adhiksham electron hoten hai to use N-prakaar ardhchaalak kehate hai, jahaan p yaa n dhanatmak prabhaar yaa rinatmak prabhaar ke aavesh vaahakon kaa suchak hai
 The production of semiconductors and their doping process takes place in a very controlled environment called fab
 P-prakaar or N-prakaar ke ardhchalkon ke bich ke jod ko P-N jod kehete hai
 a diode made of PN pair has a period of bonding between the P-type and N-type semiconductors, which does not allow the flow of current from n to P, but from p to N
 jab diod agr abhinath hota he, jahaan p kii taraf ucchtar vaidyut sanchaalan shakti hoti he, tab vidyutdhara pravaah hota he
 Conversely, the current flowing in the inverted diode is equal to no
 ardhchaalak par roshni daalane se electron-chhidr ke jode batch jaate hai, jisase chaalakata batch jaati he
 Photo diodes were created by taking advantage of this phenomenon
 sanyojit ardhchaalak diodon se prakaash paidaa kii ja sakati he, jaise prakaash utsarjak diod or leisure diod main
 The major types of transistors, dipole pair transistors, are formed in two pn pairs, npn or pnp aggregates
 madhya khand, jise "base" bhi kaha jaataa he, sankeern hota he
 Other sections are called emitters and collectors
 base or utsarjak ke bich aavesh ke antaravahit karne se base-samahrta ke gunaswabhaav me antar aa jaataa he, tatah, base-samahrta ke agr abhinath hone ke baavjood dhara pravaah hota he
 Many times more flow is found between the base-collector than the ratio of the small flow change of the base-emitter
 ek anya tarah kaa transister he kshetra prabhaav transister - is ardhchaalak ke chaalakata ko vidyut kshetra ke prabhaav se badhaaya-ghataya jaataa he
 The amount of electrons and or holes free from the influence of the electric field increases, thus increasing the conductivity
 agar is vidyut kshetra ko lagane ke liye uttkram abhinath P-N jod kaa prayog karen, to use jod kshetra prabhaav transister kehate hai; agar is vidyut kshetra ko lagane ke liye dhaatu oxide kaa prayog karaten hai, to banataa he dhaatu oxide ardhchaalak kshetra prabhaav transister Today, phosphate is the most important semiconductor device
 vidyut kshetra ko utpann karne kaa kaam "get" vidyudagr karti he, jisase "sorce" or "drain" ke bich ke channel ke chaalakata kaa niyantran hota he
 There are two types of this channel, P-channel or N-channel
 haalanki dhaatu se mosphate ko uskaa naam mila, par aaj poli silicon ko upyogit kiya jaataa he
 Silicon is most commonly used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices
 anya padaarthon kii tulana main iske mukhya gun hai kachche maal kii kam laagat, nirmaan me aasaani or vyapak taapmaana parichaalan seemaa
 Currently, the first silicon for manufacturing semiconductor devices is made by making a boule of at least 300mm width, so that it can be made of such a wide wafer
 pehle jarmenium kaa prayog vyapak tha, kintu iske ushn atisamvedansheeltaa ke karan silicon ne isaki jagah le lee he
 Today, kudhatu of germanium and silicon is often used in the manufacture of superfluous devices; IBM is a major producer of such devices
 gallium arsenid kaa prayog bhi vyapak he ativegashali yuktiyon ke nirmaan main, magar is padaarth ke chode baul nahi ban pate, jiske kaaran silicon kii tulana main gallium arsenid se ardhchaalak yuktiyon ko bananaa mehangaa pasta he
 Other substances that are either less widespread, or are being researched: tark dwaar ke banane main transister moolbhoot ang hai
 PS, logic gates are the basic construction components of a digital path
 microprocesar jaise ankiy parirpathon main transister switch kii bhaanti kaam karte hai
 For example, applying electric conductive power to the mossfet determines whether the switch closes or opens
 jin transistaron kaa prayog anuroop paripathon main hota he, vahaan inkaa prayojan switch ke rup me naa ho kar, pravardhan or dolan ke liye hota he
 In these, both investment and output correspond
 power ardhchaalak yuktiyon kaa upyog ucch volt yaa dhara ke prakalan me hota he
 Computer has to use power semiconductor devices in SMPS or motor drive etc
 
 Power digital circuits, also known as "smart" power devices, employ IC technologies at high power
 ardhchaalak yuktiyon ke avyav abhigyapak alag-alag nirmaataa alag-alag tarah se karte hai
 However, after several attempts, some standards are in vogue, such as JEDEC JESD370B in USA, Pro Electron in Europe and JIS in Japan
 ardhchalkon kaa prayog electronica ke kshetra main transister ke khoj ke pehle se hi ho rahaa he
 In early twentieth-century radio, they were seen as a detective component called "cat's mustache"
 in praarambhik sansuchakon ke chaalan main kaaphi asuvidhaayen thim - tungsten ke bane tantu ko gailena yaa carborndam crystal ke aasapaas tab tak hilaanaa pasta tha jab tak kii wo achaanak hi kaam naa karnaa shuru kar de! us samay inke parichaalan pranali ke bare main pataa nahi tha
 The use of vacuum nozzles, which were more durable, ceased to be used
 aaj ke "billi kii moochon" ko unke naye rup, shotaki diod, main dekha ja saktaa hai
 High-frequency radar research was emphasized during the Second World War, for which amplification based nozzles stopped working
 kotak magnetron ke vikaas ke baad ucch-aavruti pravardhak kii sakt zaroorat paddy
 In an instant, Bell Labs's Russell Ohl re-examines "cat mustaches"
 kai dashakon se iske prayog main naa hone ke kaaran prayogshaala main isaki ek ikai bhi na thi or ise ve dhund ke laaye menhaton ke kisi radio ke dukaan se
 Ohl investigated why the cat's mustache was so beneficial
 1939 main unhone or bhi shuddhikrut crystal par praytn kiya or paaya kii haalanki iskaa jugti ravaiya khatm ho gaya, par iske sansuchan kii kshamta bhi gaayab ho gayi
 Then one day suddenly a crystal of the highest purity lying near them started working - after looking carefully it turned out that there was a small crack in the middle of this crystal
 phir unka dhyaan is baat par gaya ke sansuchak ke kamare main jagah badalane se kabhi yah kaam karnaa shuru kar de to kabhi band kar de
 He discovers that this behavior of the crystal depends on the light falling on it
 jab unhone ise anya logon ko dikhya, walter brattan ne turant boojh liya ki crystal ke daraar par kisi tarah kaa jod ban rahaa he
 It did not take long to reveal the mystery
 crystal me daraar kaa kaaran tha daraar ke donon taraf ke bich dooshan me asantulan, jiske kaaran jahaan ek taraf kuch electron adhik the, to duusari taraf kuch kam
 As both parts were connected, the flow from one side of the electron side to the other side began when the maximum power from the battery's electrical operating power jumped to the other side, and got into the "holes" of the defect
 magar isse ek asthirataa paidaa ho gayi! adhiksham paksh me sahaj santulan ke liye ek electron kii kami hei, jise bydaree ne apane electron ko de kar purti kii or dusre taraf ke atirikt electron ko avasorana karke bydaree ne sampoorn chakra ko puraa kiya
 In this way, electric current flow was established
 bydaree kii disha ko badalane se yah pravaah tham jaataa he kyonki "chhidron" main bydaree ke electron bhar jaate hai or duusari taraf ke adhiksham electronon ke kaaran electron aage nahi batch pate
 This behavior of this diode made of two solid crystals is called semiconductor
 diod ke band hone kii pravriti jod ke paas ke aavesh vaahakon ke pruthak hone ke kaaran he or is kshetra ko | avakshay kshetra kehete hai
 To save this new knowledge of semiconductors, Pardu University, Bell Labs, MIT and together made new better crystals and ended the techniques
 ek saal ke andar hi jarmenium utpaadan main itani paripakvata aa gayi ki inkaa prayog samrik radaaron main shuru ho gaya
 After the war, William Shokley attempted to build a semiconductor device such as the Triode
 iske liye unhone nidhiyan or lab hasil kiya, jon barden or bruttan ke saath kaam karam shuru kiya
 Understanding the movement of electrons in semiconductors was important for the development of transistors
 agar diod ke utsarjak or samahrta ke bich ke is sachlan ko kisi tarah niyantrit kiya ja sake, to pravarddhak kaa vikaas kiya ja sakegaa
 If electric current is applied on both sides of a type of crystal, the flow of electrons is not established; This flow can be established if electrons or "holes" are inserted from the third end
 bade kristal kii pravarddhak ke rup main upyogita bhi kam hoti he, kyonki isamen kaaphi maatra main electronon yaa chhidron kaa antaravahan karnaa pasta he
 Overall, the making of transistors depends on the proximity of the surface to the exposure of the electrons and the input and output at short distances by the depletion region of the crystal
 bruttan ne jab ese yukti ko bananaa shuru kiya, to pravardhan kii jhalken dikhti or lupt hon jaati
 Once, by pouring the application into the water, it suddenly started working, defining mechanics, surface physics)
 kristal ke electronon kii visheshta hoti he ki ve paas ke aaveshon ke prabhaav se ekatrit hoten hai - utsarjak kii sataha ke paas electron or samahrta ke sataha ke paas chhidr ekatrit hote hai vipareet aaveshon ko dhundte hue
 They can be easily removed from this surface with the oscillation of charges in any right corner of the crystal
 agar utsarjak or samahrta paas-paas hon, to aaveshon ke antaravahan se inke bich electronon kaa dhar pravaah sthapit ho jaataa he
 Where this oscillation of charges represents a lighter signal, the stream current between the emitter and the collector is the amplified product of this signal
 bel labs main kai koshishon ke baad safalataa aakhir mil hi gayi nok-sanyog transister ke rup main
 The gold foil was lightly peeled off by affixing the gold foil to the plastic wedge, then with the wedge edge
 isse mila do bahut hi kareebi sone kaa sanyog
 Now this plastic wedge was buried in the crystal and electric power was applied on both sides of the crystal
 dhara pravaah tab hua jab kristal ke tal par lage duusare vidyut shakti se kristal ke electron tal kii taraf bah gayi
 This is the invention of the nozzle-coincident transistor
 23 disambar 1947 ko akasar transister kaa janm diwas kaha jaataa he
 This "PNP nozzle-coincident germanium transistor" had 18 times the speech amplification power
 1957 main wiliam shokli, jon barden or walter brattan ko bhautikee kaa nobel puraskaar mila
 Bell Labs' internal polling suggested several names, such as "semiconductor triode", "solid triode", etc
 jon piers ke suzav, transister, ko sabase zyada mat mili
 If you break the name, you get "transfer" and "warrister"
 shokli ko aprasannataa thi ki unhe barden or brattan ke saath transister ke avishkaar ke shrey main bhaag dena pada
 Bullock's lawyers found out that Shokley's writings had some similarities to Julius Edgar Lillian's 1925 patent, and he considered Shokley's name to be excluded from the transistor's patent
 shokli isse atyant naaraaz hue or un ne thaan lee yah dikhaane kii ki asli dimag kiskaa he
 In a few months a new type of transistor was invented, which was stable and durable compared to the nozzle-coincident transistor

 The purification of germanium was quite complex - some of the improvement came from the use of purified water, but nonetheless, because of the overpopulation of germanium, it was suggested that silicon would be a better option
 bahut kam vaigyanikon ne is par dhyaan diya
 The first transistor made of silicon was made by Gordon Teal, whose company, Texas Instruments, took great advantage
