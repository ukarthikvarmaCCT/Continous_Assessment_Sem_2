 Richard Chancellor the great English sailor and explorer
 inhone hi sabase pehle shwet sagar ko paar kiya or rus se sambandh sthapit kiye
 They were raised with great pampering at the home of Sir Philip Sydney's father
 mahaasaagar tathaa nauvidya main bachapan se hi unhen badi abhiruchi thi
 In 1553, under the leadership of Sir Hugh Willoughby, in a maritime expedition to know the route to India, the chancellor had the opportunity to be the principal sailor and to lead a ship named 'edward Bona Venture'
 maarg main lophoten dweepasmooh ke sameep tufaan main fas jane ke kaaran jahaaj ek duusare se alag ho gaye
 Chancellors waited for other ships at a predetermined location called Vardoehuis for a week

 There he received great respect and made a trade treaty on behalf of England according to which the English ships got the facility to trade
 england laut kar unhone apni report di jiske aadhaar par muscovi company kaa srijan hua
 In the summer of 1555 he again sailed on his old ship to the White Sea and made a second voyage to Moscow
 july, 1556 main swedash lautate samay aberdinshir se kuch dur abrdor main tufaan main fas jane ke kaaran unka jahaaj nasht ho gaya or 10 navambar 1556 ko unka dehanth ho gaya
 He also wrote a critical essay about Russia
 shyanta kisi taral kaa vah gun he jiske kaaran vah kisi bahari pratibal yaa aparupak pratibal ke kaaran apane ko vikrut karne kaa virodh karata he
 In general terms, it is a sign of the liquid's ability to resist the consistency or flow of it
 udhaaharan ke liye, pani patala hota he evam uski shyanta vanaspati tel kii apeksha kam hoti he jo ki gaadha hota he
 Viscosity is generally observed that all objects, whether they are gases, liquids or solids, have a tendency to inhibit if they are deformed, or relative motion is made in different parts of their bodies
 kuch vastuon main is pravriti kii koti zyada hoti he or kuch main kam
 When we spill water on a smooth surface, it is seen that the water flows faster, but if we drop the same amount of molasses or glycerin on the same smooth surface, it takes longer to spread on the surface 
 shire kii kism kii vastuon ko, jo failane main zyada samay leti hai, saadhaaran logon kii bhashaa main chipchipi yaa shyaan kehete hai, jab ki pani jaisi vastuon ko taral athwa gatisheel kii sangya di jaati he
 Thus we can say that molasses is more soluble than water
 dusron shabdon main yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki swaroopeparivartan shire main dhire dhire hota he, jab ki pani jaisi vastuon main teji se
 Viscosity is the property of liquids that causes liquid to oppose the lefties who want to change its appearance
 is prakaar ham shyanta ko kisi bhi drav athwa gas ke aantarik gharshan, ke rup main bhi dekh sakate hai
 Viscosity is found in both liquids and gases, but there are more visions than liquid gases
 isi shyanta ke kaaran drav kii ek parat duusari parat par hokar aage badhati he
 When the ship rotates on the water, the sea water presents a barrier

 Imagine two infinitely parallel plates with a fluid substance in between
 maan lijie pattica abcd apane hi samtal main, dahini disha main, ek sthir veg v se aage bad rahi he, jise chitra main tir dwaara dikhaaya gaya he, tathaa pattica a'b'c'd' apni sthir avasthaa main he
 This implies that the relative velocity of the plate is abcd
 aisi avasthaa main yah kaha jaataa he ki drav padaarth puraa kaa puraa veg v se tir dwaara pradarshit disha main gatiman he
 If the flow of fluid is going in a torrential motion, then the layer of fluid which is in contact with the stationary plate a'b'c'd 'remains fixed, while the flow of the other layers is parallel to the surface
 
 lekin in paraton kaa veg, jaise-jaise ham upar kii ore aate hai, dhire-dhire badhata chalaa jaataa he
 The final layer, which is in contact with the plaque abcd, has a velocity of v
 ab ham drav main kisi kshaitij samtal par dhyaan denge
 The molecules in this plane are accelerated by the molecules in the layer immediately above it, because the velocity of the molecules in the top layer is higher than the velocity of the molecules in the plane, while the molecules in the layer just below the horizontal plane are higher than the molecules of the horizontal plane
 Mandan is brought in motion
 isi prakaar drav kii prayek parat apane thik uuparavaali parat par ek sparsharekhiy pasch bal daalati he, jiske kaaran in donon paraton ke bich kii saapeksh gati nasht hoti he
 As a result, if we have to keep the relative motion between parallel layers of the fluid, it is imperative that an external force must dominate this retraction
 yadi bahari bal nahin hoga, to kuch samay ke baad drav kii vibhinn paraton ke bich saapeksh gati samaapt ho jaaegi
 The property of a fluid, due to its strength, opposes the relative motion between its various layers, is called viscosity, or internal friction, of the fluid
 yah gun, jo ek drav se duusare drav main keval degree yaa koti main hi antar rakhata he, har ek taral kaa ek antarnihit gundharm he
 For the squared motion, according to Newton's law of shear flow, the tangential viscous force f between parallel layers of fluid is shown by the relation given below: f = -h
 A
 dv / dz xxrep 6 
 xxrep 6 
 Where a = area of equilateral layers, dz = distance between layers, dv = relative motion of layers, dv / dz = velocity gradient and h is a constant, called "coefficient of viscosity of fluid"
 yah, athwa iskaa maan, drav kii prakruti tathaa bhautik dashaon par nirbhar karata he
 If we put a = 1, dv / dz = 1 in the relation shown above, then f = -h
 atev kisi drav kii "shyanta ke gunank" kii paribhaasha is prakaar di ja sakati he : Although the "coefficient of viscosity" is easily defined by imagining an arrangement like the above two plates and the presence of fluid between them, it is not possible to find such an arrangement experimentally
 pehle pahal pani jaisi taral vastuon kaa "shyanta ke gunank" pani ke bahaav ko, keshika nalikaaon se guzarane ke baad, maapkar nikaala gaya or aajkal bhi yah tarika vishad rup se prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 Suppose that some fluid, such as water, is passing through the narrow tube of a circular hole
 yadi pani dhararekhi gati se sankeern nalee se hokar pravaahit ho rahaa he tathaa nalee ke kisi anuprastha pariched ke upar dabaav ek samaan ho or drav kii vah parat jo nalee kii goleey diwaar ke sampark main ho evam prayogtmak rup se sthir ho, to pani kaa shyaantagunank neeche die hue sambandh dwaara nikaala ja saktaa he : Where q = the volume of water that passes through the tube every second, r = radius of the narrow tube δ p { \ displaystyle { \ Delta p}} = pressure difference between the two ends of the tube, l = narrow The length of the tube and η { \ displaystyle { \ eta}} = coefficient of viscosity
 prayogon dwaara yah paaya gaya he ki, kaaphi had tak, dravon kii shyanta taap par nirbhar he
 Although many experiments have been done in this area, no simple formula has been found which shows the high accuracy of viscosity and temperature relationship
 praaia: yah paaya jaataa he ki puure kshetra main taap ke badhane ke saath saath shyanta ghatati chali jaati he, lekin shyanta main yah ghataav prati ansh nimna taap par unche taap kii apeksha jyaad hota he
 In relation to viscosity and temperature, the slot was first given a proportional formula, which was later modified and applies only to pure liquids
 aage chalakar andrade ke siddhant par ek jatil shyanta-taap-sambandh diya gaya, jo prayogon se kaaphi santoshprad paaya gaya he or vah is prakaar he : h v1 / 3 = aec / vt xxrep 5

 jahaan a tathaa c sthiraank hai, t = taap tathaa v = vishisht aaytan he
 The viscosity coefficient of gases increases with the increase in heat
 iske sambandh main sadarland ne ek sutara diya he, jo is prakaar he : Where: jin dravon kii shyanta zyada hoti he, jaise khanij tel kii, unki shyanta kaa gunank dabaav ke badhane ke saath saath badhata he
 Except for water, a similar situation has been observed in all other liquids
 pani main pehle kai sau vaayu dabaav tak shyaantagunank ghatata jaataa he, taduparant iskaa shyaantaguna anya dravon kii tarah dabaav ke saath saath badhata he
 Regarding gases, it has been found that normally high pressure has no effect on viscosity, but at low pressure the viscosity decreases as the pressure decreases
 jis dabaav par yah prabhaav aarambh hota he, vah in do baton par nirbhar karata he : Tomas Graham first suggested that the viscosity coefficient of compounds of the same type of composition can be increased regularly if the number of molecules or groups of them is increased
 prayogon se thorp tathaa roger ne yah paaya ki kisi sajaateey shrenee kaa shyaantagunank uske anubhaar ke saath badhata jaataa he
 This growth occurs in a regular manner, while the first two or three compounds of the homogeneous range indicate anomaly

 In the atmosphere of Arun and Varun, there is more snow than Jupiter and Saturn - in addition to water ice, they also have frozen ammonia and methane gases
 isliye kabhi-kabhi khagolashastri in donon ko "barfile gas daanav" naam kii shrenee main daal dete hai
 Varuna was the first planet whose existence was predicted from the study of mathematics without ever seeing it and which was then discovered on that basis

 This unknown planet was first sighted from the telescope on 23 September 1846 after its research into astronomy and named it "noctune"
 "naptune" pracheen roman dharm main samudr ke devtaa the, jo sthaan pracheen bharat main "varun" devtaa kaa rahaa he, isliye is grah ko hindi main varun kaha jaataa he
 In Roman religion, Neptune had a trident in his hand, so Varun has an astronomical symbol
 jahaan arun grah sirf ek gole kaa rup dikhataa he jisapar koi nishaan yaa dhabbe nahin hai, vahaan varun par badal, toofaan or mausam kaa badlaav saafe nazar aata he
 It is believed that the storm wind on Varuna is faster than any planet in the solar system and speeds up to 2,100 km per hour have been observed
 jab 1989 main wayager dwitiya yaan varun ke paas se guzara to varun par ek "bada gadha dhabba" nazar aa rahaa tha, jisaki tulana brihaspati ke "bade laal dhabbe" se kii gayi he
 Because Varun is so far away from the sun, his upper atmosphere is very cold and the temperature there can fall to -128 ° C
 iske bade akar kii vajah se is grah ke centre main iske gurutvkarshan ke bhayankar dabaav se taapmaana 5,000 °centegrade tak pahunch jaataa he
 There are also some scattered rings around Varun which were seen by Voyager II

 'engineering' and 'engineer' originated from the French words Ingénierie and ingenieur
 ye shabd puraani french ke 'engigneor' se vyutpann hai jiskaa arth 'yuddh-mashin kaa nirmaataa'
 Although the words 'engineering' and 'engineer' in English are similar to French words in pronunciation, they originated from a completely different source
 itnaa hi nahin, inaki vyutpatti 'ingine' shabd se nahin hui he 
 The English word synonym for 'engineering' is "engineering", which derives from the Latin word "ingenium"; It means 'natural mastery'

 iske liye vah prototip, laghu-aakaar vaale yaa sarlikrut modelon kaa prayog, simulation, dhvamsi yaa adhwansi test tathaa fatig test aadi kaa sahaara letaa he
 Since the result of a wrong solution can be severe, the engineer uses the safety multiplier when adopting pre-fabricated solutions to minimize the possibility of side effects
 kintu suraksha-gunak jitna hi adhik hoga, hal utana hi mahangaa, bada, yaa kam daksh hoga
 Russia's innovation specialist Gennrich Altshuler concluded after studying a number of patents that small-scale engineering solutions are based on agreements, while in large-scale work the engineer chooses the solution that addresses the greatest difficulty of the problem

 There are many varieties of cryptanalysis attacks and can be classified in many ways
 ek saamaanya vibhedan is aadhaar par kiya jaataa he ki ek hamalavar kya jaanata he or koun si kshamtaayen uplabdh hai
 In cipher text sole attack, only cipher text is available to the crypto analyzer
 main, kript vishleshak ke liye sifer text or isse sambandhit plane text uplabdh hote hai ek chaynit plane text hamale main, kript vishleshak ek plane text ko chunata he or isse sambandhit sifer text kaa adhyayan karata he, ; iskaa ek udhaaharan he dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan british ke dwaara prayukt gardening 
 Finally, in a selected cipher text attack, the cryptanalyst is able to select the cipher text and study the associated plaintext

 ek kushal sifer ke khilaaf kisi bhi hamale kii tulana main yah adhik prabhavi hota he
 For example, a simple brute force attack against DES requires a known plane text and 2 55 decryptions, it attempts at about half of the possible keys to reach a point where there are better possibilities

 The most famous of these is the integer multiplication clause
 lekin asatat laghuganak kii samasyaayen bhi bahut mahatvapurn hai
 Most public keys use statistical algorithms to effectively solve cryptanalysis, these computational problems, or some of them
 
 For example, the best-known algorithms for solving the ellipsoid curve based version of discrete logarithms take much longer to solve, compared to the best-known algorithms for multiplication blocks to solve common size problems

 If the amount of time is available to a crypt analyzer and the device encrypts a number of plane text, or it detects an error in a password or PIN character, it uses a timing attack to break a cipher Can, which is resistant to analysis

 Currently in practice, since the relaxation of US export restrictions and because almost every personal computer is connected to the Internet, web browsers from the US source such as Mozilla Fire Fox and Microsoft Internet Explorer are used everywhere in the world

 Love or love is a feeling
 pyaar anek bhaawanaaon kaa, ravaiyon kaa mishran he jo parsparik sneh se lekar khushi kii ore vistaarit he
 It is a strong attraction and a sense of personal engagement
 ye kisi kii dayaa, bhaavana or sneh prastut karne kaa tarika bhi mana ja saktaa he
 To act or show affection towards oneself, or to an animal, or to a human being can be called love
 kehete hai ki agar pyaar hota he to hamaari zindagi badal jaati hai
 The ancient Greeks recognized four types of love: kinship, friendship, romantic desire, and divine love
 pyaar ko aksar vaasana ke saath tulana kii jaati he or parsparik sambadh ke taur par romani adhiswar ke saath tola jaataa he, pyaar dosti yani pakki dosti se bhi tola jaataa hai
 Love is generally a feeling that one person feels towards another person
 agar ham prem kii baat karen to prem jivan he jis tarah H+o2 =h2o hota he thik usee tarah se pyaar bhi do logo ke bich milakar jivan kaa nirmaan karata he Love is a chemical because it is not a yantra, but a solution, of the seer and the vision
 soundarya ke drishy tabhi drashtaa kii drushti main vilyit ho pate hai,or yahi avasthaa prem kii avasthaa hoti he
 The process of origin and stimulation of love and beauty starts from the beginning
 soundarya manushya ke vyaktitv ko prabhavit karatasatya sanathan he, or prem us soundarya main samaaya rahata he
 There is attachment in love
 yadi aasakti na ho to prem prem na rahakar keval bhakthi ho jaati he
 Love is the stage between fascination and devotion
 ek vyakti kisi vastu, yaa tatv, yaa lakshya se prem kar saktaa he jinase wo juda he yaa jinka wo sammaan karata he
 Human beings can also love any thing, animal or work with which they feel personal association and want to keep themselves connected
 avaiyaktik pyaar saamaanya pyaar jaisaa nahin he, ye insaan ke aatma kaa nazariyaa he jisase dusron ke prati ek shaanti-purvak maansik ravaiya utpann hota he jo dayaa, sanyam, maafee or anukanpa aadi bhavanaaon se vyakt kiya jaataa he
 If it is said in a simple sentence, impersonal love is said to be the behavior of a person towards others
 isiliye, avaiyaktik pyaar ek vastu ke prati insaan ke soch ke upar aadhaarit hota he
 The love between human beings is called mutual love
 ye sirf ek duusare ke liye chaah nahin he balki ek shaktishaalee bhav he
 Love whose feelings are not exchanged is called non-refundable love
 aisa pyaar parivaar ke sadasyon, doston or premiyon ke bich paaya jaataa hai
 Mutual relationship is strong, deep and close cooperation with two human beings
 ye rishta anumaan, ekajutata, niyamit vyapaar baatcheet yaa samaajik patibaddhit kaarnon se banataa he
 They are influenced by social, cultural and other factors
 ye prasang parivaar, rishtedaari, dosti, shaadi, sahakarmi, kaam, padosi or mandir-masjid ke anusaar badalata he
 It can be regulated by law or by customs and mutual agreement
 ye samaajik samoohon or samaaj kaa aadhaar he
 In biological models of sex, love is shown as hunger and thirst
 hellen fisher, pyaar kii pramukh visheshgy hai
 They have divided the experience of love into three parts: lust, attraction, attachment
 havas yon ichha hoti he
 Romantic charm determines what attracts you in your partner
 aasakti main ghar baant ke jeena, maan-baap kaa kartavya, aapasi raksha or suraksha kii bhaavana shaamil he
 Lust is the initial passionate sexual desire that promotes sexual intercourse
 ye samagam or rasayan kii rihaai ko badhaava detaa he
 Its effect lasts for a few weeks or months
 aakarshan ek vyaktigat or romani ichha he jo ek hi manushya ke prati he jo havas se utpann hoti he
 This increases commitment from one person
 jaise jaise manushya pyaar karne lagate hai, unke mastishk main ek prakaar ke rasayan kii rihaai hoti hai
 Stimulates the center of happiness in the human brain
 is vajah se dil ki dhadakanen bad jaati hai, bhukh nahin lagati, neend nahin aati or utsaah kii teevr bhaavana jaagrrit hoti he
 Attachment is an attachment that enhances relationships over the years
 aasakti patibaddhta par nirbhar karti he jaise shaadi, bachche yaa dosti par
 Psychology refers to cognitive and social phenomena
 manovigyaani robert sternberg ne pyaar ke tribhujaakar siddhant ko sutarabaddh kiya hai
 He argued that love has three different components: intimacy, commitment, and passion
 atmiyata wo tatv he jisamen do manushya apane aatmavishvaas or apane zindagi ke vyaktigat vivaran ko baantate hai
 It is mostly seen in friendship and romantic work
 patibaddhta ek ummid he ki ye rishta hameshaa ke liye kaayam rahegaa
 Finally there is sexual attraction and passion
 aveshpurna pyaar, romani pyaar or aasakti main dikhaaya gaya he
 All forms of love are a combination of these components
 pasand karne main atmiyata shamil hoti hai
 Enchanted love only involves passion
 khali pyaar main sirf patibaddhta shaamil hai
 Romantic love involves both intimacy and passion
 saathi ke pyaar main atmiyata or patibaddhta shaamil hota hai
 Wise love includes commitment and passion
 akhir main, ghaagh pyaar main teenon shaamil hote hai
 Evolutionary psychology has given many reasons to prove love to be a major means of survival
 inke hisaab se manushya apane jeevankaal main abhibhavakiy sahaayta par anya stanpayiyon se zyaada nirbhar rahete hai, pyaar ko is vajah se abhibhavakeey sahare ko prachaar karne kaa tantra bhi mana gaya hai
 It can also be because love can lead to sexually transmitted diseases, which can affect the fertility of humans, can cause injury to the fetus, may also cause complications while producing children
 ye sab chijen jaanane ke baad samaaj main bahuvivaah kii paddati ruk sakati hai
 Azad Pyaar describes a social movement that does not observe a sacred bond like marriage

 The transfer of heat from a hot body to a cold body is called heat transfer
 jab kisi vastu kaa taapmaana uske parivesh yaa anya vastu kii apeksha bhinn hota he to taap urja kaa sanchaar jise taap kaa bahaav yaa taap kaa vinimay bhi kehete hai, is tarah se hota he ki vah vastu or uskaa parivesh ooshm-samyata grahan kar lete hai; iskaa matlab he ki donon kaa taapmaana samaan ho jaataa he
 According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics or Clausius' statement, heat always transports from a warmer object to a colder one
 jahaan kahin bhi paas-paas sthit vastuon main taapmaana kii bhinnata hoti he, unke bich ooshmaa ke sanchaar ko kabhi roka nahin ja saktaa; ise keval kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Conduction of heat through direct contact with particles in matter is called conduction
 urja kaa sanchaar praathmik rup se sunamya samaghaat dwaara jaise dravon main yaa paraasaran dwaara jaisaa ki dhaatuon main hota he yaa phonon kampan dwaara jaisaa ki insulatoron main hota he, ho saktaa he
 In other words, when the surrounding atoms vibrate towards each other, or electrons move from one atom to another, heat is transmitted by conduction
 sanchaalan thos padaarthon main adhik hota he, jahaan parmaanuon ke bich apekshaakrit sthir sthanik sambandhon kaa jaal kampan dwaara unke bich urja ke sanchaar main madad karata he
 In a situation where the flow of fluid is not happening at all, the heat conductance corresponds directly to the osmosis of particles in the fluid
 is prakaar kaa taap paraasaran bartaav main thoson main hone vaale pindia paraasaran se bhinn hota he, jabaki pindia paraasaran adhiktar dravon tak hi simit hota he
 Metals are generally the best conductors of heat energy
 aisa dhaatuon ke rasaynic rup se bandhit hone ke tareeke ke kaaran hota he; dhatvik baandon main mukt rup se chalane vaale electron hote hai jo taap urja kaa teji se dhaatu main sanchaar kar sakate hai
 As the density decreases, the operation also decreases
 isaliye, drav kam sanchaalak hote hai
 This is due to greater distance between atoms in the gas: less collision between atoms means less conduction
 The conductivity of gases increases with temperature
 The conductivity of gases increases with the increase in pressure from the vacuum to a critical point until the density of the gas is so high that the molecules of the gas collide with each other before transmitting heat from one surface to another
 After this point in density, conductance increases slightly with increasing pressure and density
 is baat kii gananaa karne ke liye ki koi vishesh madhyam kitni aasaani se sanchaalan karata he, ejeeniyar ooshm sanchaalakata kaa prayog karte hai, jise sanchaalakata constent yaa sanchaalan gunak, k bhi kehete hai
 The definition of k in thermal conductivity is - 'the amount of heat transmitted from a surface to a thickness in the general direction from the surface of a place in time due to the variation in temperature, Q'
 Thermal conductivity is a material property that is primarily dependent on the state of the medium, temperature, density, and molecular binding
 taap nalee ek niskriy upkaran he jiskaa nirmaan is tarah se kiya jaataa he ki jisase aisa prathit hota he ki usamen atyant ucch ooshm sanchaalakata he
 In steady state operation, the heat entering a part is equal to the heat coming out of it

 Whenever the internal heat operation of an object is much faster than the heat operation of its boundary, volatile operation can be estimated by mass system analysis
 yah upgaman vidhi asthir sanchaalan pranali ke ek pahalu ko uchit rup se gata detii he In this method, a term called the Beot number is calculated which is defined as the ratio of the resistance of the heat conduction at the boundary of the same protrusion to the temperature of an object and the internal conductor heat barrier of the object
 jab thermal pratirodh garmi ke uddeshy main sthanantarit karne ke liye pratirodh garmi se bhi kam kii ja rahi vastu ke bheetar puri tarah se visarit, kam se kam Biot sankhya 1

 Convective heat circulation also increases as the speed of the liquid increases
 drav ke pariman main gati kii upasthiti thos sataha or taral ke bich taap ke sanchaar ko badhaava detii he
 There are two types of conductive heat transmission: sanvaahan ko aantarik or bahya pravaah ke aadhaar par bhi vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 Internal flow occurs when the liquid is locked in a solid, such as the flow in a pipe
 External flow occurs when a liquid expands indefinitely without coming into contact with a solid surface
 ye dono sanvaahan, chaahe ve prakritik hon yaa balaat, aantarik yaa bahya ho sakate hai kyonki ve ek duusare se swatantra hote hai
 The rate of conductive heat exchange is given as: a taap sanchaar kisatah kaa kshetrafal he
 t s is the surface temperature and t b is the temperature of the liquid at the bulk temperature
 lekin t b sthiti ke anusaar badalata rahata he or sataha se ‘bahut dur’ sthit taral kaa taapmaana he
 h is a constant heat transmission multiplier that depends on the physical properties of the liquid such as temperature and the physical state in which the convection occurs

 adarsh sanrachanaon or taralon ke liyetaap sanchaar gunakon kii gananaa karne ke liye kai sutara or sahasambandh uplabdh hai
 The heat transmission coefficient for thin layer flows is lower than for turbulent flows; This is due to the turbulent currents having a more thin fixed layer of liquid on the heat exchanging surface
 taap urja ke kisi rikt sthaan main sanchaar ko vikiran kehete he
 All objects with temperatures above absolute zero radiate energy equal to the rate at which the energy is radiated, if they are a black object

 The energy of the Sun passes through the vacuum of space before heating the Earth
 sabhi pindon kii paravartakata or pravaahakta dono hi tarangadairghy par nirbhar karti hai
 According to Planck's Law of black-body radiation, the temperature determines the distribution of the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation to the extent of intensity
 kisi bhi pind ke liye paravartakata bheetar aa rahe vidyutchumbakeey vikiran ke tarangadairghy ke vitaran or isaliye vikiran ke strot ke taapmaana par nirbhar karti he
 The conductivity depends on the distribution of wavelength and therefore on the temperature of the body

 Light colors and white objects and metallic materials reduce the absorption of light, and are therefore less hot, but otherwise at everyday temperatures, color has no specific effect on the heat communication between an object and its surroundings, as potent
 The emitted wavelengths are not near the visible spectrum, but rather far away in infrared
 in tarangadairdhyon par maujuud utsargataaon kaa dikhne vaali utsarjanataon se koi sambandh nahin hota; sudur infrared main adhiktar vastuon main ucch utsarjanataayen hoti hai
 Therefore, the color of clothing has no effect on heat, except in sunlight; Similarly, there is no difference in the color of the paint applied to the houses, except for the part on which sunlight falls
 iskaa mukhya apwaad he, chamakdaar dhatvik satahen jinamein darshneey tarangadairdhyon or sudur infrared, dono main kam utsarjanataayen hoti hai
 Such surfaces can be used to reduce heat transmission in both directions; An example of this is the multi-stage separator used to isolate the spacecraft

 Finally, it is possible for the heat or cold to flow from one place to another through physical communication
 yah kisi bottle main garm pani daalkar aapke bistar ko garm karne yaa himkhand ke bahane se samudr kii tarangon ke badalane jitna aasaan he
 a related theory, according to Newton's Law of Cooling, is the rate of heat loss of an object in proportion to the difference between the temperature of that object and its ambient temperature
 This rule is given as a specific equation: taap hraas sutara kaa yah prakaar kabhi-kabhi adhik sahi nahin hota; bilkul sahi sutara ke liye asamroop yaa kam sanchaalak madhyam main taap sanchaar sameekaran par aadhaarit taap pravaah ke vishleshan kii jarurat hoti he

 vastu kii sataha sanchaalakata ko aantarik taap sanchaalakata se sambandhit karne vaale bayot number kii sahmati ke anusaar nimna sarleekaran kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 By this ratio, it is found that the object has a relatively high internal conductivity, allowing the entire object to remain at the same temperature, although this temperature varies when the atmosphere is cooled from outside
 aisa hone par, ye paristhitiyaan vastu ke taapmaana main samay ke saath ghaatankeey hraas utpann karti hai
 In this case, the whole body is assumed to be a mass capacitance heat collector whose total heat volume is directly proportional to the simple total heat capacity c and the body temperature T, or q = CT
 The definition of heat capacity c gives the relation c = dq / dt
 is sameekaran ko samay ke sandarbh main vishleshit karne se nimna pahchaan milti he: dq / dt = c 
 is vyanjana ko upar is khand ke prarambh main diye gaye pehle sameekaran main dq / dt ke sthaan par prayog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Then, if t is the temperature of such a body at time t and the temperature of the atmosphere of the body is tenv: to: r = ha / c is a positive constant characteristic of a system that must be in the unit of 1 / time, and is therefore sometimes expressed as a specific time constant t0: r = 1 / t0 = ΔT / 
 In heating systems like this, t0 = c / ha
 is prakaar uparokt sameekaran upyogi rup se is tarah se bhi likhaa ja saktaa he: The solution to this equation is by ideal methods of inclusion and displacement of boundary conditions: yahan, tii tii tii main samay taapmaana he or main shunya samay, t = 0 yaa tii taapmaana praarambhik he
 "if" tab neutonian samaadhaan ke rup main likhaa he: Uses: For simplified weather models, a neutral cooling can be used in place of the full radiation code to maintain atmospheric temperatures
 taap sanchaar prayogon main ek atyant upyogi siddhant he, taap sanchaar kaa taap circuiton dwaara pratinidhitiv

 The heat resistance is calculated as the denominators of the developed equations for different types of heat communication
 taap sanchaar ke vibhinn prakaaron ke tapiya pratirodhon kaa prayog taap sanchaar ke sanyukt prakaaron ke vishleshan main kiya jaataa he
 The equations detailing the three types of heat exchanges mentioned earlier and their thermal resistances are summarized in the list below: jahaan kahin bhi vibhinn madhyamon main se taap kaa sanchaar hota he, anuroop pratirodh composit kii rachana karne vaale tatwon ke pratirodhon ke yoga ke baraabar hota he
 Probably the total resistance in different heat transmission types is equal to the sum of the resistances of the different types
 taap sanchaar siddhant ke anusaar, kisi bhi madhyam ke jariye sanchaarit taap taapmaana main parivartan or madhyam ke taap pratirodh kaa bhagfal hota he
