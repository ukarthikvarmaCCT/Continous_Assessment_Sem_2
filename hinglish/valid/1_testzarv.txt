vatsyayan ne dashavyavaadee naiyayikon kaa ullekh kiya he, isse siddh he ki unke pehle se bhashyakaar naiyayikon kii parampara chali aati thi
 The period of the creation of Astu, Sutras has to be considered before the propagation of Buddhism
 vaidic, buddha or jain naiyayikon ke bich vivaad isa kii paanchavin shatabdi se lekar 13 veen shatabdi tak baraabar chalata rahaa
 This led to the creation of many texts of rebuttal
 14 veen shatabdi main gangashopadhyaay hue jinhone 'navyanyay' kii neenv daali
 Of the sixteen substances which were theorems etc
 in ancient justice, the heavy rhetoric was raised by excluding all and only the 'proof'
 is navyanyay kaa aavirbhaav mithila main hua
 Navyanya took a more formidable form by going from Mithila to Nadia
 na usamen tatvanirnay rahaa, na tatvanirnay kii samarthy
 Gautama's justice is not just a scripture that determines the rules of proof, logic, etc
, but is a philosophy of thinking of specific theorems like soul, sense, rebirth, sorrow and exclusion
 gautam ne solah padaarthon kaa vichaar kiya he or unke samyak gyaan dwaara apvarg yaa moksh kii prapti kahi he
 There are sixteen substances or subjects - proof, theorem, doubt, purpose, illustration, principle, element, logic, judgment, suit, jalp, vittanda, fallacy, deceit, caste and negativity
 in vishyon par vichaar kisi madhyasth ke saamne baadi prativaadee ke cathopakathan ke rup main karaayaa gaya he
 When a dispute is present in a matter, it is necessary to first decide who will be considered as the evidence of both the litigants
 isse pehle 'pramaan' liya gaya he
 After this, the subject of controversy ie 'theorem' has been discussed
 vishay suchit ho jane par madhyast ke chitt main andeh utpann hoga ki uskaa yatharth swarup kya he
 The idea of the same is known as 'doubt' or 'doubt'
 andeh ke uparant madhyasth ke chitt main yah vichaar ho saktaa he ki is vishay ke vichaar se kya matlab
 This 'purpose' happened
 vaadi sandigdh vishay par apana paksh drushtaant dikhaakar badalaata he, vahi 'drushtaant' padaarth he
 The party to which the plaintiff confirms it is his 'principle'
 vaadi kaa paksh suchit hone par pakshasaadhan kii jo jo yuktiyaan kahi gai hai prativaadee unke khand khand karke unke khandan main pravrutt hota he
 Seeing the fragmented tips, the plaintiff again gives further tips that answer the defendant's tips
 yahi 'tark' kaha gaya he
 By logic, the statement of Panchavayukta tips has been called 'ism'
 vaad yaa shastrarth dwaara sthir satya paksh ko na maanakar yadi prativaadee jeet kii ichha se apni chaturaai ke bal se vyarth uttar pratyuttar karata chalaa jaataa he to vah 'jalp' kehalaata he
 In this way, the defendant will give some good tips for some time, then he will start licking what is called 'vittanda'
 is vitanda main jitne hetu die jaayange ve thik na honge, ve 'hetvabhaas' maatr honge
 In addition to those tips and tricks, if the defendant wants to make a mess by deliberately manipulating the sentence to make the plaintiff nervous, he is called his 'deceit' and if he starts to establish his favor with the help of secularism, legalism etc
 Caste
 is prakaar hote hote jab shastrarth main yah avasthaa aa jaati he ki ab prativaadee ko rokkar shastrarth band kiya jaay tab 'nigrahasthaan' kaha jaataa he
 The fruit of love is a book by Nihalchand Berry, who works in the name of "hindi Pracharak Library"

 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The sermon that Shri Krishna preached to Arjuna in the battlefield of Kuru region is known as Srimad Bhagavadgita
 yah mahabharat ke bhishmaparv kaa ang he
 The Gita has 18 chapters and 720 verses
 jaisaa gita ke shankar bhashya main kaha he- tan dharman bhagawata yathopadisht vedavyas: sarvagyobhagavan gitakhyai: saptabhi: shlokashatairu panibandh
 It is known that in the early 20th century, in front of Geeta Press Gorakhpur, there was the same text of Geeta which is available to us today
 20veen sadi ke lagbhag bhishmaparv kaa java kii bhashaa main ek anuwaad hua tha
 Many basics are also safe in it
 shripad krishna belwelkar ke anusaar java ke is pracheen sanskaran main gita ke keval saadhe ikyasi shloke mul sanskrit ke hai
 They also support the current text
 gita kii gananaa prasthaantrayee main kii jaati he, jisamen upanishad or brahmasutra bhi sanmilit hai
 Therefore, according to Indian tradition, the place of Gita is the same as that of Upanishads and Brahmasutras
 gita ke mahatmaya main upanishdon ko gau or gita ko uskaa dugdh kaha gaya he
 This means that the Gita accepts the spirituality of the Upanishads in the Sarvansh
 upanishdon kii anek vidyaayein gita main hai
 For example, Ashwattha lore in relation to the nature of the world, Avyayamusha lore in the context of eternal Ajna Brahma, Aksha Purushu vidha in the matter of Para Prakriti or Jiva, and Ksharapurushu Vidya concerning Apara Prakriti or material world
 is prakaar vedon ke brahmavaad or upanishdon ke aadhyatm, in donon kii vishisht saamagree gita main sannivisht he
 In the words of Pushpika it is called theology
 gita main 'brahmavidya' kaa aashay nivrittiparak gyanmarg se he
 It is called Sankhyamat with which the Nivitvarigi Vibhagya is associated
 lekin gita upanishdon ke mode se aage badhkar us yug kii dein he, jab ek nayaa darshan janm le rahaa tha jo grihasthon ke pravriti dharm ko nivritti maarg ke samakaksh or utana hi faldaayak maanata tha
 The same signifies the word 'yogashastra' in the Pushpika of the Gita
 yahan ‘yogashastre’ kaa abhipraay ni:andeh karmyog se hi he
 Two definitions of yoga are found in the Gita
 ek nivritti maarg kii drushti se jisamen ‘samatvam yoga uchyate’ kaha gaya he arthath gunon ke vaishamy main samyabhav rakhana hi yoga he
 This is the position of Sankhya
 yoga kii duusari paribhaasha he ‘yoga: karmsu kaushalam’ arthath karmon main lage rahane par bhi aise upaay se karm karnaa ki vah bandhan kaa kaaran na ho or karm karanevaala usee asang yaa nirlep sthiti main apane ko rakh sake jo gyanamargiyon ko milti he
 The name of this device is Buddhayog and this is the essence of the Yoga of the Gita
 gita ke duusare adhyay main jo ‘tasya pragnapratishthita’ kii dhun pai jaati he, uskaa abhipraay nirlep karm kii kshamtavali buddhi se hi he
 This was not a situation of attaining renunciation by the renunciation of karma, but a plan to elevate the pre-existing mind to a state of disinterest while performing karma
 yahi gita kaa karmyog he
 Just as in many places in the Mahabharata, so is the interpretation and appreciation of the Sankhya path of Sankhya and the path of Karma
 ek kii ninda or duusare kii prashansa gita kaa abhimath nahin, donon maarg do prakaar kii ru chi rakhanevaale manushyon ke liye hitkar ho sakate hai or hai
 Probably no other book of the world renders the scripture of Karma with this beauty, this subtlety and objectivity
 is drushti se gita adbhut maanviya shaastra he
 Its vision is not one-sided, but all-round
 gita main darshan kaa pratipaadan karte hue bhi jo sahitya kaa anand he vah isaki atirikt visheshta he
 The description of the philosophy through cultured poetry is the personal grief of the Gita, which does not remain without enchanting any heart
 isiilie iskaa naam bhagavadgita padaa, bhagavan kaa gaaya hua gyaan
 The background of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita is the war of Mahabharata
 jis prakaar ek saamaanya manushya apane jivan kii samasyaon main ulajhakar kinkartavyavimudh ho jaataa he or uske pashchaat jivan ke samarangan se palaayan karne kaa man bana letaa he usee prakaar arjuna jo mahabharat kaa mahanayake he apane saamne aane vaali samasyaon se bhaybheet hokar jivan or kshatriya dharm se niraash ho gaya he, arjuna kii tarah hi ham sabhi kabhi-kabhi anishchay kii sthiti main yaa to hataash ho jate hai or yaa phir apni samasyaon se udign hokar kartavya vimukh ho jate hai
 The sages of India, after deep thought, imbibed the knowledge they gave to the Vedas
 inhen vedon kaa antim bhaag upanishad kehalaata he
 The characteristic of human life is the intellectual power acquired by human beings, and the knowledge contained in the Upanishads is not only the highest state of human intelligence but also gives a glimpse of what man can experience beyond the limits of intellect
 gita ke 18 adhyyon main varnit vishyon kii bhi kramprapt sangati he
 The name of the first chapter is Arjunvishad Yoga
 vah gita ke upadesh kaa vilakshan naatakeey rangamanch prastut karata he jisamen shrota or vaktaa donon hi kutuhal shanti ke liye nahin varan jivan kii pragadh samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye pravrutt hote hai
 Shaurya and patience, courage and strength made Arjuna's personality with the impressive amount of these four qualities and above all these four qualities were one and forgiveness, the other is wisdom
 balpradhan kshatradharm se praapt honevaali sthiti main pahunchakar sahasaa arjuna ke chitt par ek duusare hi prakaar ke manobhaav kaa akraman hua, carpanya kaa
 a strange kind of compassion filled his mind and his faint nature vanished
 jis kartavya ke liye vah katibaddh hua tha usase vah vimukh ho gaya
 On looking from above, his arguments in favor of this situation seem to be religious, but he himself has called it Karpanya Dosh and it is believed that due to this cuteness of mind, his natal nature was hurt or destroyed
 vah nirnay nahin kar paa rahaa tha ki yuddh kare athwa vairaygy le le
 What to do, what not to do, was not understood
 is manobhaav kii charam sthiti main pahunchakar usne dhanushbaan ek ore daal diya
 Krishna saw Arjuna's condition that Arjuna's body was fine but before the start of the war, the morale of that wonderful Kshatriya was broken
 bina man ke yah sharir khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Therefore, a guru duty came in front of Krishna
 at: tark se, buddhi se, gyaan se, karm kii charchaa se, vishwa ke swabhaav se, usamen jivan kii sthiti se, donon ke niamak avyay purush ke parichay se or us sarvopari param sattavan brahm ke saakshaat darshan se arjuna ke man kaa uddhaar karnaa, yahi unka lakshya hua
 The subject of this discussion is Gita
 pehle adhyay main saamaanya reeti se bhoomika rup main arjuna ne bhagwaan se apni sthiti kah di
 The second chapter is named Sankhyayoga
 isamen jivan kii do pracheen sanmanit paramparaon kaa tarkon dwaara varnan aayaa he
 Seeing Arjuna weeping in that sorrowful condition, Krishna has brought to his attention that this type of claviness and petty infirmity of heart is not suitable for a hero like Arjun
 krishna ne arjuna kii ab tak di hui sab yuktiyon ko pragnawad kaa jhootha rup kaha
 His trick is that Pragyadarshana essentially accepts all the events and situations of the world from time, karma and nature
 jeena or maranaa, janm lenaa or badhanaa, vishyon kaa aana or janaa
 Experiences of happiness and sorrow, these occur only in the world, this was also called the ancient Acharya synonymism
 kaal kii chakragati in sab sthitiyon ko laati he or le jaati he
 After knowing this nature of life, there is no mourning again
 yahi bhagwaan kaa vyangy he ki pragna ke drushtikon ko maanate hue bhi arjuna is prakaar ke moh main kyon pad gaya he
 An essential part of the above view was the continuity of life and the impermanence of the body
 nity jeev ke liye shok karnaa utana hi vyarth he jitna anitya sharir ko bachaane kii chintaa
 Both of these are unavoidable
 janm or mrityu baari baari se hote hi hai, aisa samajhakar shok karnaa uchit nahin he
 Then another view is of apostasy
 janm se hi prakruti ne sabake liye ek dharm niyat kar diya he
 In it comes the path of life, the periphery of desires, the power of karma
 isse nikal kar nahin bhaaga ja saktaa
 Even if someone runs away, nature again pulls him
 is prakaar kaal kaa parivartan yaa pariman, jeev kii nityata or apana swadharm yaa swabhaav jin yuktiyon se bhagavan, ne arjuna ko samajhaayaa he use unhone sankhya kii buddhi kaha he
 Further, even after Arjuna did not question, he also described the wisdom of the yogamarga
 yah buddhi karm yaa pravriti maarg ke aagrah kii buddhi he isamen karm karte hue karm ke fal kii aasakti se apane ko bachaana aavashyak he
 The biggest fear for the Karmayogi is that he gets trapped in the party of desire for fruit; He should avoid it
 arjuna ko andeh hua ki kya is prakaar kii buddhi praapt karnaa sambhav he
 What would be the situation of a person if he did deeds and no fruit, it was a practical doubt
 usne poocha ki is prakaar kaa drudh pragnawala vyakti jivan kaa vyavhaar kaise karata he? aana, janaa, khaanaa, pinaa, karm karnaa, unamem lipt hokar bhi nirlep kaise rahaa ja saktaa he? krishna ne kitne hi prakaar ke bahya indriyon kii apeksha man ke sanyam kii vyakhya kii he
 Through work, anger, fear, raga, malice, the mild mind is disturbed and the senses are not in control
 indriyajay hi sabase badi aatmajay he
 Even if someone gives up subjects from outside, the inner mind does not agree
 vishyon kaa swaad jab man se jaataa he, tabhi man prafullit, shant or sukhi hota he
 Rivers come in the sea, but he does not give up his dignity
 aise hi sansar main rahete hue, uske vyavhaaron ko sweekaarte hue, anek kaamanaayon kaa pravesh man main hota rahata he
 But those who do not lose their dignity only get peace
 ise pracheen aadhyatm paribhaasha main gita main brahmisthiti kaha he
 Thus, listening to the answer of Sankhya's explanation, in the third chapter called Karmayoga, Arjuna asked a clear question to get deeper into the subject that Sankhya and Yoga do you think well in both these passages and why not say that i am in both of them Whom should i adopt? To this, Krishna replied with the same clearness that there are two loyalties or lifespans in the world - jnana yoga for the Samkhists and karmayoga for the Karmargamis
 yahan koi vyakti karm chhod hi nahin saktaa
 Nature compels a person to perform actions with the effect of all three qualities
 karm se bachnewaalon ke prati ek badi shankaa he, vah yah ki ve upar se to karm chhod baithte hai par man hi man usamen duube rahete hai
 This situation is unbearable and Krishna has called it falsehood in the Gita
 man main karmedriyon ko rokkar karm karnaa hi saral maanviya maarg he
 Krishna even said as a challenge that without karma one cannot get food to eat
 phir krishna ne karm ke vidhaan ko chakra ke rup main upasthit kiya
 Not only are the creations of different persons threaded together on the social plane, but the relationship between man on earth and God of heaven is also dependent on the action cycle
 pratyaksh he ki yahan manushya karm karte hai, krishi karte hai or daivi shaktiyaan vrishti kaa jal bhejti hai
 Both grain and purgenes arise from karma
 ek main maanviya karm, duusare main daivi karm
 Then in favor of Karma, the idea of lok Sangraha has been given, that is, without Karma, the structure of society cannot stand
 jo lok ke netaa hai, janak jaise gyani hai, ve bhi karm main pravriti rakhte hai
 Krishna himself gave his own illustration and said that i am the form of Narayana, there is no work left for me
 phir bhi tandrarahit hokar karm karata hoon or anya log mere maarg par chalate hai
 The difference is that those who are foolish do the work by indulging but the knowledgeable does the work with disrespect
 gita main yaheen ek sabhipraay shabd buddhibhed he
 That is, it is not proper to uproot the people of ordinary understanding who are engaged in karma, because they cannot become knowledgeable, and if their karma is missed, then they will go astray on both sides
 chauthe adhyay main, jiskaa naam gyaan-karm-sanyas-yoga he, yah bataaya gaya he ki gyaan praapt karke karm karte hue bhi karmsanyas kaa fal kis upaay se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In this true Karmayoga is considered to occur in the tradition of the Chakravarti kings
 mandhata, sudarshan aadi anek chakravarti raajaaon ke drushtaant die gaye hai
 This is the famous assurance of the Gita that when there is defamation of religion, then there is an incarnation of God among humans, that is, the power of God is especially tangible
 yaheen par ek vaakya vishesh dhyaan dene yogya he- kshipran hi manushe loke siddhirbhavatee karmaja 
 'karma se siddhi' - There is no more effective sutra in Gitadarshan
 kintu gitatv is sutara main itnaa sudhaar or karata he ki vah karm asang bhav se arthath falasakti se bachakar karnaa chahie
 In the fifth chapter, again she has gone somewhere in the form of tips and perseverance
 isamen karm ke saath jo man kaa sambandh he, uske sanskaar par yaa use vishuddh karne par vishesh dhyaan dilaayaa gaya he
 It has also been said that there is no difference between Sankhya and Yoga by reaching a high level
 kisi ek maarg par thik prakaar se chale to samaan fal praapt hota he
 By surrendering all the deeds of life, a person reaches the pole point of absolute peace and does not indulge in karmic water like a lotus blooming in water
 chatha adhyay aatmasanyam yoga he jiskaa vishay naam se hi prakat he
 The number of subjects is the restraint of the most senses - this is the squeeze of karma and knowledge
 sukh main or dukh main man kii samaan sthiti, ise hi yoga kehete hai
 The noun of the seventh chapter is Jnana Vigyan Yog
 ye pracheen bhartiya darshan kii do paribhaashaayen hai
 Among them, the word science was very important from the Vedic point of view
 sristi ke nanaatv kaa gyaan vigyaan he or nanaatv se ekatv kii ore pragati gyaan he
 Both these views are suitable for humans
 is prasang main vigyaan kii drushti se aparaa or para prakruti ke in do roopon kii jo sunishchit vyakhya yahan gita ne di he, vah avashya dhyaan dene yogya he
 Apara Prakriti has eight elements, Panchabhuta, Mind, Wisdom and Ego
 jis and se maanav kaa janm hota he
 These eight live in it
 kintu yah praakrit sarg he arthath yah jad he
 In this, the consciousness that comes from contact with the efforts of God is called Para Prakriti; He is a living being
 aath tatwon ke saath milakar jivan navaan tatv ho jaataa he
 In this chapter, many forms of God are mentioned, whose further expansion comes in the tenth chapter called Vibhutiog
 yaheen vishesh bhagwati drushti kaa bhi ullekh he jiskaa sutara-vasudev: sarvamiti, sab vasu yaa shariron main ek hi devtatv he, usee kii sangya vishnu he
 But in the people according to their own idi, the same deity is worshiped in many names and forms
 ve sab thik hai
 But it is good that a wise person recognizes the universe which is the highest peak of spiritual science
 aathven adhyay kii sangya akshar brahmyog he
 Akshar Vidya expanded in Upanishads
 gita main us aksharavidya kaa saar kah diya gaya he-akshar brahm paraman, arthath parabrahm kii sangya akshar he
 Spirituality is the name of the combined composition of man, that is, organism and body
 jeevasanyukt bhautik deh kii sangya kshar he or keval shaktitatv kii sangya aadhidaivak he
 The way these three powers work together in the body, the God, and the ghost are called Adhigyas
 gitakar ne do shlokon main in chah paribhaashaon kaa swaroop band diya he
 In the words of Gita, ॐ monosyllable is Brahman
 nawein adhyay ko raajaguhyayog kaha gaya he, arthath yah aadhyatm vidya vidyaraji he or yah guhya gyaan sabamein shreshth he
 The word Raja also had a meaning in mind
 atev man kii divya shaktimayon ko kis prakaar brahmamay banaaya jaay, isaki yukti hi rajvidya he
 In this area, the representation of Brahmanism is predominant, from which the creation of the expressed world is repeated
 veda kaa samast karmkand yajna, amrit, or mrityu, sant or asant, or jitne bhi devi devtaa he, sabakaa paryavsaan brahm main he
 The variety of Devpuja which is popular in the world is also right in its place, this vision of coordination was acceptable to the Bhagwat Acharyas, in fact it was their great power
 isi drushtikon kaa vichaar yaa vyakhya dasven adhyay main pai jaati he
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 iskaa saar yah he ki lok main jitne devtaa hai, sab ek hi bhagwaan, kii vibhutiyaan hai, manushya ke samast gun or avagun bhagwaan kii shakti ke hi rup hai
 Wisdom may be able to explain these liberated gods, but they are there in the world
 koi pipal ko pooj rahaa he
 Some mountain, river or sea, some fish and turtles
 yon kitne devtaa hai, iskaa koi ant nahin
 This abundance of deities is found everywhere in the history of the world
 bhagwaton ne inaki satta ko sweekaarte hue sabko vishnu kaa rup maanakar samanvay kii ek nai drushti pradaan kii
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 jo satv jeev balayukt athwa chamatkarayukt he, vah sab bhagwaan kaa rup he
 Considering this, the mind gets into an uncontrolled state
 11wein adhyay kaa naam vishvaroopadarshan yoga he
 In this, Arjuna saw the world form of God
 viraat rup kaa arth he maanviya dharaatal or paridhi ke upar jo anant vishwa kaa pranavant rachanavidhan he, uskaa saakshaat darshan
 The quadrilateral form of Vishnu is benign on the human plane
 jab arjuna ne bhagwaan kaa viraat rup dekha to uske mastak kaa visphoton hone laga
 'directo na jaane na labhe f shame' These same sentences of panic came out of his mouth and he prayed that the natural condition which God has placed for man is sufficient
 13wein adhyay main ek sidhaa vishay kshetra or kshetrajna kaa vichaar he
 This is the body area, the person who knows it is a field expert
 14wein adhyay kaa naam gunatray vibhaag yoga he
 This subject is a squeeze of all the Vedic, philosophical and mythological metaphysics — there are many interpretations of the three gunas — trios called sattva, raja, tam
 gunon kii samyavastha kaa naam pradhan yaa prakruti he
 a pathless creation is born from the contrast of qualities
 akelaa satv shant swabhaav se nirmal prakaash kii tarah sthir rahata he or akelaa tam bhi jadvat nishcesht rahata he
 But Rajoguna, who is in the middle of the two, drags them to the ground of Chesta
 gati tatv kaa naam hi rajas he
 The name of the 15th chapter is Purushottamayoga
 isamen vishwa kaa ashwatth ke rup main varnan kiya gaya he
 This ashwattha-like world is a great expansion
 desh or kaal main iskaa koi ant nahin he
 But the root or center of it, which is called the upward, is Brahm
 On the one hand, the ultimate glory, which gives rise to the cosmopolitan Ashwattha, is manifested in the form of the Sun and the Moon, on the other hand, it is in a Chaitanya center or Zoological
 Is in the body
 jaisaa gita main spasht kaha he-ahan vaishwanaro bhutva praninaan dehamashrith: 
 There is no more mystery than globalism or pranamayi consciousness
 nar yaa purush teen hai-kshar, akshar or avyay
 The name of the Panchabhutas is Kshar, the name of Prana is Akshar and the noun of Manastattva or Consciousness is indestructible
 inhen teen naron kii ekatra sthiti se maanvi chetana kaa janm hota he use hi rishiyon ne vaishwanar agni kaha he
 In the 16th chapter, the department of Dewasur property is described
 aarambh se hi rigdev main sristi kii kalpana daivi or asuri shaktiyon ke rup main kii gai he
 It is a fantasy of two forms of creation, one good and the other bad
 ek prakaash main, doosraa andhkaar main
 One nectar, the other mortal
 ek satya, doosraa anrut
 The noun of the 17th chapter is Shraddhatraya Vigyan Yoga
 iskaa sambandh sat, raj or tam, in teen gunon se hi he, arthath jisamen jis gun kaa pradurbhaav hota he, uski shraddha yaa jivan kii nishtha waisi hi ban jaati he
 Yagya, penance, charity, deeds are all conducted with three types of devotion
 yahan tak ki aahaar bhi teen prakaar kaa he
 The Gita has explained their differences and characteristics here
 18wein adhyay kii sangya mokshasanyas yoga he
 It contains a summary and epilogue of all the teachings of the Gita
 yahan pun: balpurvak maanav jivan ke liye teen gunon kaa mahatv kaha gaya he
 There is no one among the human beings of the earth and among the gods of heaven who is saved from these three qualities of nature
 manushya ko bahut dekh bhalkar chalanaa aavashyak he jisase vah apni buddhi or vritti ko buraai se bachaa sake or kya kaary he, kya acarya he, isko pahchaan sake
 The intellect which properly recognizes religion and unrighteousness, bondage and salvation, instinct and retirement, is the true wisdom and is the true achievement of man
 is prakaar bhagwaan ne jivan ke liye vyaavhaarik maarg kaa upadesh dekar ant main yah kaha he ki manushya ko chahie ki sansar ke sab vyavhaaron kaa sachai se paalan karte hue, jo akhand chaitanya tatv he, jise ishwar kehete hai, jo prayek praani ke hriddesh yaa centre main virajman he, usamen vishwaas rakhe, uskaa anubhav kare
 He is the entity's power, he is consciousness and he is the source of supreme bliss
 sanskrit sahitya kii parampara main un granthon ko bhashya, kehete hai jo duusare granthon ke arth kii vrihad vyakhya yaa tikaa prastut karte hai
 The Bhagavad Gita is also one of the three texts that had to clarify their perspective in order to establish any new philosophy or any new form of philosophy in the Indian philosophical tradition
 gita par anek achaaryon evam vidwaanon ne tikaayen kii hai
 Their short list according to sects is as follows: inke atirikt maharashtra sant gyandev yaa gyaneshwarkrut bhavarthadipika naam kii tikaa prasiddh he jo gita ke gyaan ko bhavatmak kavyastylee main prakat karti he
 In the present era, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilakkrit Geetarasya Tika, which was first introduced in 1915 with very detailed role and deliberation
 main puna se prakashit hui thi, gita sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhti he
 He has made such a diversion in bringing the original meaning of Gita to scholars, which was not possible till today after Shankaracharya
 vastut: shankaracharya kaa bhashya gita kaa mukhya arth gyanaprak karata he jabaki tilak ne gita ko karm kaa pratipadak shastr siddh kiya he
 Among all the languages available on the Bhagavad Gita, the element of Shri Jayadayal Goindka is the most popular and popular
 iskaa prakaashan gitapress ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Aaj Tak has sold 100 million copies
 shrimadbhagavadgita badalte saamaajik paridrishyon main apni mahatta ko banaae hue hai or isi kaaran takneekee vikaas ne isaki uplabdhta ko badhaayaa he, tathaa adhik bodhgamy banane kaa prayaas kiya he
 In the serial Mahabharata, aired on Doordarshan, Bhagavad Gita was a special attraction, while in the serial Sri Krishna, the Bhagwad Gita was highly researched and shown as a series of episodes
 isaki ek vishesh baat yah rahi ki gita se sambandhit saamaanya manushya ke sandehon ko arjuna ke prashnon ke madhyam se uttarit karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Apart from this, the serial gita-rahasya by Nitish Bhardwaj was completely focused on different dimensions of Gita itself
 internet par bhi aaj anekanek websiten is vishay par bahumadhyamon ke dwaara vishad jaankaree detii hai
 Shrimad Bhagwadgita is currently attracting attention of people not only in India but also abroad with her philosophical approach towards life more than religion
 nishkaam karm kaa gita kaa sandesh prabandhan guruon ko bhi lubhaa rahaa he
 It is included in the most famous books of all religions of the world
 gita press gorakhpur jaisi dharmik sahitya kii pustakon ko kaaphi kam mulya par uplabdh karaane vaale prakaashan ne bhi kai aakaar main arth or bhashya ke saath shrimadbhagavadgita ke prakaashan dwaara ise aam janata tak pahunchane main kaaphi yogadan diya he
 The teachings of the Gita are very ancient yoga
 shri bhagavan kehete hai ise maine sabase pehle surya se kaha tha
 The Sun is the symbol of knowledge, so the words of Shri God mean that even before the creation of the earth, i have given this knowledge to the devotees who have done many forms of research
 yah ishwariya vaani he jisamen sampoorn jivan kaa saar he evam aadhaar he
 Who am I? What is this body? Is my beginning and end with this body? Will i exist after my body renunciation? Where and in what form will this existence exist? What is the reason for me coming into the world? What will happen after leaving my body, where will i go? These things keep revolving in the heart of any curious person
 ham sadaa in baton ke bare main sochate hai or apane ko, apane swaroop ko nahin jaan pate
 In the Gita Shastra, the answers to all these questions have been readily given by Shri Bhagwan through religious dialogue
 is deh ko jisamen 36 tatv jeevatma kii upasthiti ke kaaran judakar kaary karte hai, kshetra kaha he or jeevatma is kshetra main nivas karata he, vahi is deh kaa swami he parantu ek teesraa purush bhi he, jab vah prakat hota he; adhidaiv arthath 36 tatwon vaale is deh ko or jeevatma kaa naash kar daalata he
 This perfect man is the ultimate state and ultimate truth

 The soul is eternal and the soul has attained the spirit of life
 sharir ke mar jane par jeevatma apane karmanusaar vibhinn yoniyon main vicharan karata he
 The Gita begins with the word Dharma and at the end of the eighteenth chapter of the Gita it is called Dharma Samvad
 dharm kaa arth he dhaaran karne vaala athwa jise dhaaran kiya gaya he
 The one who holds is called the soul and the one who holds it is nature
 aatma is sansar kaa beej arthath pita he or prakruti garbhadhaaran karne vaali yoni arthath mata he
 The word Dharma is used in the Gita from place to place for self-nature and living nature
 isi paripeksh main dharm evam adharm ko samajhnaa aavashyak he
 The nature of the soul is religion or it is said that religion is spirit
 aatma kaa swabhaav he purna shuddh gyaan, gyaan hi anand or shaanti kaa akshay dham he
 On the contrary, ignorance signifies unrest, tribulation and unrighteousness
 aatma akshay gyaan kaa strot he
 Kriya Shakti arises from different amounts of knowledge power, birth of nature
 prakruti ke gun satva, raj, tam kaa janm hota he
 Excess of sattva-raja gives rise to religion, demonic circles prevail in excess of tam-raja and the establishment of dharma means to establish the nature of virtues, for the growth of satoguna, soul attaining indestructible Brahmi status, its resolve She incarnates herself and performs incarnation
 sampoorn gita shaastra kaa nichod he buddhi ko hameshaa sookshm karte hue mahabuddhi aatma main lagaaye rakkho tathaa sansar ke karm apane swabhaav ke anusaar saral rup se karte raho
 It is easy to do nature's karma and it is difficult to follow the other's nature's karma, because every living being is born with a different nature, it becomes easy to live in the nature that has come into the world
 shri bhagwaan ne sampoorn gita shaastra main baar-baar atmrat, aatm sthit hone ke liye kaha he
 It is easy for the intellect to become detached while doing natural deeds, so it is considered the definitive path

 kisi ghatana ke hone kii sambhaavna ko prayikta yaa sambhavyata kehete hai
 It is used extensively in the fields of statistics, mathematics, science, philosophy etc
 saadhaarant: sambhavyata kaa sambandh us ghatana se he jiske na hone kii apeksha ghatit hone ko adhik aashaa he
 In this sense it is different from Shakya
 ghatana shakya tab hoti he jab uske ghatane main virodh nahin hota
 It is neither possible nor feasible to have 'mother of the Mother'
 'swarna parvat' sambhavya nahin he, parantu shakya he
 In the scientific sense, probability is related to an event which is neither definite nor impossible
 yadi nishchit gyaan kaa pratik 'ek' mana jaae or nishchit gyaan ke abhaav kaa 'shunya', tab sambhavyata kaa sthaan inhen '0' or '1' ke madhya nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 There are basis of probability
 jevens ne sambhavyata ke aadhaar ko aatmagat mana he
 He considered faith to be the basis of probability
 yah mat doshayukt bataaya gaya he, kyonki sambhavyata kaa sambandh pariman se he or vishwaas ko maatra main vyakt karnaa sambhav nahin he
 It is also not appropriate to consider belief as the basis of probability because probability is calculated and this calculation is not possible with confidence
 vah isliye ki jis vastu main vishwaas hota he uskaa kabhi to anubhav nahin hota or kabhi kabhi ek anubhav par hi do vyaktiyon kaa vishwaas bhinn bhinn ho jaataa he
 Probability is related to arrival
 aagaman nirikshan or pareekshan par aadhaarit he
 Therefore, it is not appropriate to call probability purely subjective, because inspection and testing is thematic
 inhen uparyukt trutiyon ke kaaran kuch vichaarkon ne sambhavyata ko vishaygat pramanit kiya he
 Probability depends on experience
 anubhav vishaygat he
 Based on experience, we believe in the occurrence or not of an event
 yah vishwaas aatmagat he
 Hence the conclusion that the basis of probability is both experience and belief
 sambhavyata kii gananaa ganit dwaara hoti he
 There are different types of events
 at: unki sambhavyata kii gananaa kii bhi reeti bhinn bhinn hai
 To find the probability of a simple event, divide the probability of the occurrence by the entire number of the number of times the event occurred
 taash kii 52 pattiyon main is baar khinchne se kaala paan kaa badshaah nikle, isaki sambhaavna jaanane ke liye niyam he : Therefore, the probability of black king being king is 1 / 52
 saath saath nahin ghatanevaali do ghatnaon main ek ghatana ghatane kii sambhaavna kii gananaa ke liye unki alag alag sambhaavna ko jod dena padataa he
 In 52 cards of cards, there is a possibility of one slave and emperor coming out: isi prakaar do swatantra ghatnaon ke saath saath hone kii sambhaavna unki alag alag sambhaavnaaon ko aapas main guna karke nikaalte hai
 Rainbow and rain are likely to occur along with these two independent events: yahi niyam adheen ghatnaon ke saath bhi lagu he
 To find the probability of the truth of the evidence collected, we subtract the product of its impossibilities from 1
 anyaanya gavaahon dwaara bataai gai ghatana ke satya hone kii sambhaavna is prakaar nikaali ja sakati he : ek gavaahi main satya hone kii sambhaavna jab 5 / 6 he to usamen satya hone kii asambhaavna hogi
 Then the probability of being true in the second testimony is 2 / 3 when it is unlikely in donon kii alag asambhaavnaaon ke gunanfal ko 1 main se ghataane par uttar hoga - Thus, the probability of the incident stated by the witnesses to be true will be 17 / 18
 is prakaar sambhavyata kii maatra sankhya ke aadhaar par hi nikaali jaati he
 Therefore, if the number is not calculated completely, the quantity of probability cannot be determined
 sambhavyata kii gananaa ke uparaant jis nishkarsh kii prapti hoti he vah ausat ke liye hi satya hota he
 In other words, say that the probability is true for the average

 Ultimately, the possibility of the arrival of a large British force led by General Joseph Smith led to the retreat of the Maratha forces
 angrejo kii foot daalo or raaj karo kii niti kaa ye ek or udhaaharan tha
 Company soldiers of Indian origin consisted mainly of the Mahar Regiment soldiers belonging to the Bombay Native Infantry, and hence the Mahars consider this war a heroic episode of their history
 1800 ke dashak tak, maraathon ko ek dhili sahabhaagita main sangathit kiya gaya, jisamen pramukh ghatak pune ke peshwe, gwalior ke sindhiya, indore ke holkar, baroda ke gaekwad or nagpur ke bhosle the
 The British converted and signed peace treaties with these factions, establishing residences on their capitals

 This Treaty of Pune formally ended the Peshwa's suzerainty over other Maratha chiefs, thus officially ending the Maratha Confederacy
 
 iske turant baad, peshwa ne pune main british racidensi ko jala diya, lekin 5 november 1817 ko pune ke paas khadki ke yuddh main parajeet kiya gaya tha
 The Peshwas then fled from Satara, and company forces gained complete control of Pune
 pune ko karnal charles barton barr ke tahat rakhaa gaya tha, jabaki general smith ne ek british sena ke netritv main peshwa ko apanaaya tha
 Smith feared that the Marathas might escape the Konkan and capture the small British contingent there
 isliye, unhone karnal bor ko nirdeshit kiya ki vah konkan ko sena bhej sake, or badale main, aavashyak hone par shirur se sainikon ke liye bulaayen
 Meanwhile, the Peshwa managed to escape beyond Smith's pursuit, but his south advance was forced by the company led by General Theophilus Pritler
 uske baad unhone apane maarg ko badal diya, purvottar kii ore se nasik kii ore uttar-pashchim kii ore jane se purv kii ore agrasar ho gaya
 To realize that General Smith was in a position to stop him, he suddenly went south towards Pune

 Sir John Strachey has said about the variations of India that "the first important thing to know about India is that India was never a nation, nor is it, nor does it have any geographical, political, according to European views There was social or religious unity, there was no Indian nation nor any Indian, about which we hear a lot
 " isi sambandh me sar jon shile kaa kahana he ki "yah vichaar ki bharatvarsh ek raashtra he, us mul par aadhaarit he jisko raajnneeti shaastra sweekaar nahin karata or dur karne kaa praytn karata he
 India is not a political name but a geographical name like Europe or Africa
 " It is clear from the above views that the rise and development of nationalism in India took place in circumstances which create obstacles instead of providing help in the path of nationalism 
 vaastaviktaa yah he ki bhartiya samaaj kii vibhinnataaon main moulik ekta sadaiv vidyaman rahi he or samay-samay par raajnneetik ekta kii bhaavana bhi udai hoti rahi he
 In the words of V
A
 Smith, "in fact the unity of India lies in its diversity
 " british shashan kii sthapana se bhartiya samaaj main naye vichaaron tathaa nai vyavasthaaon ko janm mila he in vichaaron tathaa vyavasthaaon ke bich hui kriyaaon or pratikriyaaon ke parinamswaroop bharat main rashtriya vichaaron ko janm diya
 To understand Indian nationalism it is necessary to understand its social background
 bharat main angrejo ke aane se pehle bhartiya gram aatmanirbhar samudaay the
 They were like small republics that were self-sufficient in everything
 british purv bharat main gramin arthvyavastha krishi or kutir udyogon par aadhaarit thi or sadiyon se jyon-kii-tyon chali aa rahi thi
 The technical level in agriculture and industry was very low
 samaajik kshetra main parivaar, jati panchayat or gramin panchayat saamaajik niyantran kaa kaary karti thim
 Some cities in the urban area were important in terms of political, some religious and some business
 adhiktar rajyon kii rajdhani kisi na kisi nagar main thi
 Most of the small scale industries were prevalent in the cities
 in udyogon ko rajkeey sahaayta praapt hoti thi
 In most villages and towns, there was little intercultural exchange, as the means of transport and conveyance were very less developed
 is prakaar rajnatik parivartanon se gram kii saamaajik sthiti par bahut kam prabhaav padataa tha
 Due to the different villages and cities being different from each other, the feeling of an all-india nation could never arise in the country
 bharat main jo bhi rashtriyata kii bhaavana thi, vah adhiktar dharmik or adarshavaadi ekta kii bhaavana thi, vah rajnatik va aarthik ekta kii bhaavana nahin thi
 People used to travel from east to west and north to south India to make pilgrimage and this created a sense of religious unity of the country, but the whole country was divided into small conflict states, which had equal wars
 
 duusari ore gramin samaaj in rajnatik parivartanon se lagbhag achoote rahete the
 Indian culture has been predominantly religious
 isamen rajnatik tathaa aarthik mulyon ko kabhi itnaa mahatva nahin diya gaya, jitna ki aadhunik samskruti main diya jaataa he
 The unity of Indian culture is also religious idealistic unity
 usamen rashtriya bhaavana kaa adhiktar abhaav hi dikhalaai detaa he
 After the victory of the British in India, there was widespread transformation in Indian society
 british samrajya kii sthapana kaa kaaran mughal samrajya kaa patan or desh kaa anek chote-chote rajyon main vibhajit ho janaa tha
 British rule was different from pre-muslim regimes in many respects
 bhartiya logon kii tulana main angrejon kii rashtriyata kii bhaavana, anushaasan, desh bhakthi or sahyog kahin adhik dikhaai padate the
 Their qualities also influenced the Indian elite
 angreji shashan ke bharat kii aarthik sanrachana par doorgaami prabhaav pade
 This shocked the ancient Asian society in another country and established Western society on the other side
 isse desh main rajnatik ekta kaa nirmaan hua
 Due to its influence, the movement of nationalism developed in the country
 usase desh kii krishi vyavastha me amul chul parivartan hua
 Before the arrival of the British, land was not considered as a king
 use jotanevaale raja ko kar diya karte the, astu bhoomi nijee sampatti bhi nahin maani jaati thi
 With the arrival of the British, the land did not have the right of the rural community, but it became the personal property of the individuals
 is prakaar desh ke kuch bhaagon main jamidaaron or anya bhaagon me kisaanon kaa bhoomi par adhikaar ho gaya
 During the reign of Lord Cornwallis, the zamindar class emerged in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa
 isse gramin arthvyavastha me doorvarti parivartan hue
 In other parts of the country, with the Ryotwadi management, the farmers were given rights over the land they plowed
 sar thomas ne madras ke governor ke rup main san 1820 i0 me raiyatwari vyavastha prarambh kii
 This led to extensive social, political, cultural and psychological changes in the country
 lagaan dene kii nai vyavastha main gramin panchayat nahin balki jameendaar or kisaan sidhe sarkaar ko kar dene lage
 Thus, the agricultural system came into a state of trade and the traditional Indian rural system disintegrated
 kramshah krishi vyavastha kaa roopaantaran hone laga
 With the establishment of private rights on the land, small pieces of land began to grow
 is apkhandan se kheti par bura prabhaav padaa
 The new system of collecting revenue created a new class of government employees
 jinka doorvarti raajnneetik mahatva he
 The economic condition of the country started deteriorating, poverty started increasing
 gaanvon main logon par karj badhane laga, jisase kramshah bhoomi kheti karanevaalon ke haath se nikal kar kheti na karanevaale bhu-swaamiyon ke haath main jane lagi
 This led to the creation of a new class of land-slaves, whose interests were against the interests of the landowners
 krishi ke kshetra me ek ore sarvhaara bhu-das or duusari ore paropjivi jameendaar varg kaa nirmaan hua, jinamein paraspar sangharsh or tanaav badhane laga
 The creation of these classes led to extensive socioeconomic and political changes
 british shasankaal main nagareey arthvyavastha me bhi vyapak parivartan hue
 The cottage industries suffered a setback
 videshi shashan main unke hiton par kutharaghaat hua, unke maal kii khapat kam hoti gai, jisase kramshah paramparaagat udyog samaapt hone lage
 The social status of the artisans began to decline and other occupations started leaving artisanal work
 videshon se aae hue bane-banaaye maal ke muqablon main deshi maal kii khapat ghatane lagi, jiske parinamswaroop bharat adhiktar kaccha maal utpaadan karne kaa strot ban gaya or desh ke bazaar videshi maal se bhare jane lage
 This background is of great importance in the development of modern industries in the country
 angrejon ne apane laabh ke liye desh main yatayaat or sandesh vaahan ke saadhan badhaaye
 He established new industries
 in sabase dhire-dhire rashtriyata kii bhaavana ke vikaas main sahaayta mili
 New people studying English severely criticized the economic policy of the British
 desh me udyogon ke vikaas se poonjipati varg badhane laga
 Most of the Indian industries had foreign capital
 is prakaar desh kii arth-vyavastha desh ke liye hanikaarak or angrejon ke liye laabhadaayak thi, duusari ore vyapaar or udyog ke kshetra main unka ekadhikaar bad gaya
 The British propagated English education to create a class in the country that could assist them in governance
 purv-british bharat main adhiktar shiksha dharmik shiksha thi jo sanskrit paathshaalaon tathaa muslim madrason ke madhyam se di jaati thi
 Christians propagated modern education in the country, although one of the aims of their education was to increase the number of Christians in the country, but it also encouraged Western and modernization processes
 angrejon ne saamaanya shiksha ke atirikt vyavsaayik shiksha dene ke liye bhi vidhyalay khole
 Due to the influence of western education, a special class was created in the country which paid attention to national education
 yah varg shiksha ke mahatva ko bhaleebhanti jaanata tha
 The Brahmo Samaj, Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission, Aligarh movement also encouraged education
 kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay or aligarh main muslim vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana hui
 Dayanand iglo-vedic schools and colleges were established in many places in the country
 angreji shiksha ke prasar se jahaan ek ore kaale angrejon kaa varg badha jo ki keval janm se bhartiya or sab prakaar se angrej the, vahiin duusari ore aise padhe-likhe varg kaa bhi nirmaan hua jo ki desh kii pracheen paramparaon par garv karte the
 These people started the national movement in the country
 bharat main angreji shiksha pranali kii chaahe jo bhi aalochana kii jaae yah nishchit he ki usase desh me rashtriya aandolan kaa sutarapaat hua
 This gave rise to a wave of nationalism, democracy and socialism
 angrejon se pehle bharat main moulik, rajnatik or prashasnic ekta kaa sarvatha abhaav tha
 The British had established a general system of political and administrative terms in the whole country, they established a state of law in their state
 ye kanoon rajya ke prayek naagarik par lagu kiye gaye or inako lagu karne ke liye desh main ek jatil nyaay vyavastha kaa nimarn hua rajya dwaara niyukt nyaayadhish kanoonon kii vyakhya karte the
 And applied the Acts of the State to the citizens
 sampoorn desh main nichali adaalaton, ucch nyaayalayon tathaa sangheey nyaayalayon tathaa council kii sthapana hui
 Which could be appealed to the Privy Council
 is prakaar kanoon reeti-rivaajon par aadhaarit na hokar adhik nishchit ban gaye
 With the establishment of the state of law, the rights of the local panchayats were reduced and uniformity was established in the judicial system
 angrejon ke aane ke pehle ke bharat main or angreji rajya kanoonee vyavastha main baari antar dikhalaai padataa he jabaki purv british kanoon adhiktar dharmik swavrittiyon par aadhaarit tha, british kanoon adhinium or janatantreey mulyon par aadhaarit tha usamen jati varg, prajati varg, ling ke bhedbhaav ke bina rajya ke prayek naagarik ko samaan adhikaar praapt the
 Thus, for the first time in Indian history during the British rule, unity was established among the people of the country on a democratic basis
 kanoonee ekta ke atirikt british shashan main prashasnic ekta kii bhi sthapana hui, nagareey main jisamen soobe kii prashasnic vyavastha samast desh main ek prakaar kii thi
 Due to extensive changes in the system of rent, land-related law and order was established in the country, in which laws were spread in the whole country with respect to the purchase and sale of land and living
 aarthik kshetra main british sarkaar ne samast desh main ek se sikke kaa prasar kiya jisamen vyapaar or kray-vikray me abhootpurv vruddhi hui
 During the British rule, new classes emerged with the expansion of new social and economic system and new administrative system and new education
 ye varg pracheen bhartiya samaaj main nahin paae jate the
 These originated from the capitalist system during the British rule
 kintu desh ke vibhinn bhaagon main in nae virgon kaa ek hi prakaar se udai nahin hua
 The reason for this was that English rule was not established simultaneously in different parts of the country and neither reforms were implemented simultaneously
 sabase pehle bengal me angreji shashan kii sthapana hui or vahiin se pehle jameendaar varg utpann hua
 Similarly, in Bengal and Bombay, firstly large industries were established and classes of industrialists and laborers were created there, finally when the British rule was established in the whole country, new social classes started appearing everywhere at the national level
 in nae virgon ke nirmaan me purv british saamaajik va aarthik sanrachana kaa mahatvapurn yogadan tha
 For example, before the arrival of the British, trade and industry was more in the banias and during the British rule also these people first created the capitalist class, due to less spread of education in the Muslim population than Hindus, they had intellectuals, middle class and The bourgeoisie appeared much later than Hindu communities
 is prakaar angreji shasankaal main jameendaar varg, bhoomi jotane vaale, bhuswami varg, krishi shramik, vyapaaree varg, sahuukaar varg, poonjipati varg, madhyam varg, chote vyapaaree or dukandaar varg, doctor, vakil, professor, manager, clerk, aadi vyavsaayee varg or vibhinn kaarkaanon or bagichon main kaam karanevaale shramik varg kaa udai hua
 The interests of many of these classes were against each other and they launched several new movements to protect their interests
 bharat main rashtravaadi vichaardhaara kaa ankur satrahavin shatabdi ke madhya se ugane laga tha kintu yah dhire-dhire viksit hota rahaa ant me 1857 i0 main purna ho gaya
 Therefore, it would be appropriate to consider the period of Indian national awakening as the middle of the nineteenth century
 bharat main rashtrawaad ke janm ke kaaran jo rashtriya aandolan prarambh hua vah vishwa main apane aap main ek anoothaa aandolan tha bharat main raajnneetik jagriti ke saath-saath saamaajik tathaa dharmik jagriti kaa bhi sutarapaat hua
 In fact social and religious awakening resulted in the rise of political awakening
 dow jakaaria kaa mat he ki ”bharat kaa punarjagran mukhyatah aadhyatmik tha
 It initiated many religious and social reforms long before it took the form of the movement of political salvation of the nation
 “ is rup me bhartiya rashtriya jagriti europea deshon main hui rashtriya jagriti se bhinn he
 The following reasons are considered for the rise and destruction of nationalist ideas in India: bharat me rashtriya jagriti paidaa karne me 19 veen shatabdi main hue saamaajik tathaa dharmik aandolanon kaa bahut bada haath rahaa he
 The social and religious conditions of the country were getting worse day by day and superstitions and mischiefs had arisen in the society in the name of religion
 in aandolanon ne ek or dharm tathaa samaaj main vyaapt buraaiyon ko dur karne kaa prayaas kiya to duusari ore bharat main rashtriyata kii bhav bhoomi taiyaar karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 Such movements are particularly notable in Brahma Samaj, Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission and Theosophical Society, whose promoters were Raja Rammohan Roy, Swami Dayanand, Swami Vivekananda, and Mrs
 Annie Besant, respectively
 in sudhaarkon ne bharatiyon main aatmavishvaas jaagrit kiya tathaa unhen bhartiya samskruti kii gaurav garima kaa gyaan karaayaa, unhen apni samskruti kii shreshthata ke bare main pataa chalaa
 Among these great men, Raja Ram Mohan Roy can be called the forerunner of Indian nationality
 unhone samaaj tathaa dharm me vyaapt buraaiyon ko dur karne hetu agast 1828 i0 me brahm samaaj kii sthapana kii
 Raja Ram Mohan Rai tried to remove the evils of sati, discrimination and idol worship in untouchability
 unke prayaso ke kaaran aadhunik bharat kaa nirmaan sambhav ho sakaa
 Hence he is called the creator of modern India
 dow aar0 si0 majumdaar ne likhaa he ki raja ram mohan raay ko bekan tathaa martin lukar jaise prasiddh sudhaarkon kii shrenee main gina ja saktaa he
 AC Sarkar and KK Dutt believe that Raja Ram Mohan Roy started the spiritual era of political awakening and reform of religion in modern India, he was an era promoter
 isliye dow jakaaria ne unhen sudhaarkon kaa aadhyatmik pita kaha he
 Many scholars consider him as the 'father of India' and 'the pioneer of the new era'
 raja rammohan raay ne bharatiyon ke liye raajnneetik adhikaron kii maang kii
 In 1823, newspapers were banned by the Press Ordnance
 is par raja ram mohan raay ne is ardinence kaa prabal virodh kiya or use radd karwaane kaa har sambhav kiya iske pashchaat unhone jeuri act ek aandolan prarambh kar diya
 In the words of Dr
 RC Majumdar, "raja Ram Mohan Roy" was the first Indian who presented the hardships and grievances of his countrymen to the British Government and showed the way of organizing the political movement by organizing the Indians to be a forerunner of the modern movement
 can be given
 “ Swami Dayanand Saraswati became a great reformer after Raja Rammohun Roy
 jinhone 1875 i0 main bombay main 'arya samaaj' kii neenv rakhi
 Arya Samaj was simultaneously a movement of religious and national renaissance, it gave India and Hindu caste a new life
 swami dayanand ne na keval hindu dharm tathaa samaaj me vyaapt buraaiyon kaa virodh kiya apitu apane deshavaasiyon main rashtriya chetana kaa sanchaar bhi kiya
 He highlighted the shortcomings of Christianity and pointed out the importance of Hinduism and attracted the attention of Indians towards its civilization and culture
 unhone vaidic dharm kii shreshthata ko phir se sthapit kiya or yah bataaya ki hamaari samskruti vishwa kii pracheen evam mahatvapurn samskruti he
 He believes that Vedas are the storehouse of knowledge and is the true Hindu religion in the world, on the strength of which India can become a guru by restoring his reputation in the world
 swami dayanand saraswati ne apane granth 'satyarth prakaash' main nirbhiktapurvak likhaa he HB Sharda has written that- shrimati ani bessent ne likhaa he- Swami Vivekananda propagated Indian culture in Europe and America
 unhone angrejon ko yah bataa diya ki bhartiya samskruti pashchimi samskruti se mahaan he or ve bahut kuch bhartiya samskruti se sikh sakate hai
 Thus he awakened the cultural consciousness in India and inspired the people here to achieve cultural victory
 is uddeshy kii prapti ke liye bharat kaa swatantra hona aavashyak he
 Thus he supported the political independence of Indians which gave extraordinary strength to national sentiments
 bhagini nivedita ke anusaar swami vivekananda bharat kaa naam lekar jite the
 He was an ardent devotee of the motherland and taught Indian youth to worship him
 thiosophical socity kii netaa shrimati ani bessent ne bhartiya rashtrawaad ke vikaas main mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 Mrs
 Annie Besant was a foreign woman, when Indians heard the praise of Hinduism through her mouth, she could not live without being impressed
 jab unhen apni samskruti kii shreshthata kaa gyaan hua to unhone angrejon ke viruddh swadhinata kii prapti hetu aandolan armbh kar diya
 The gist is that 19th century reformers created a national awakening in the Indian public
 unhone aisa vaataavaran taiyaar kiya jiske kaaran bharat swatantrata ke lakshya ko praapt kar sakaa

 R
 Desai has written in this regard that these movements were less struggle for greater freedom and social equality and their ultimate goal was nationalism
 1707 i0 ke baad bharat main raajnneetik ekta kaa lop ho chukaa tha kintu angrejon ke samay lagbhag sampoorn bharat kaa prashasan ek kendriya satta ke adheen aa gaya tha
 The same laws and rules were implemented throughout the empire
 samast bharat par british sarkaar kaa shashan hone se bharat ekta ke sutara me bandh gaya
 Thus political unity was established in the country
 yatayaat ke sadhano tathaa angreji shiksha ne is ekta kii neenv ko or adhik thos bana diya jisase rashtriya aandolan ko bal mila
 Thus, India became a form of politics
 dow ke0ve0 punnia ke shabdon main ”himalay se kanyakumari tak sampoorn bharat ek sarkaar ke adheen tha or isane janata main raajnneetik ekta ko janm diya
 " videshi vidwaanon kii khojon ne bhi bharatiyon kii rashtriya bhaawanaaon ko bal pradaan kiya
 Sir William Jones, maxmuller, in anusandhanon ne bharatiyon ke man main ek nayaa gyaan or utsaah jaagrit kiya
 This raised a question in his mind that why are we under control? According to Dr
 RC Majumdar's statement, "this discovery could not fail to generate consciousness in the minds of Indians, as a result of which their hearts were filled with nationalism and patriotism
" " shri ke em paanikkar likhte he ki in aitihaasik anusandhan ne bharatiyon main aatmavishvaas jaagrit kiya or unhen apni sabhyataa or samskruti par garv karnaa sikhalaayaa
 With these discoveries, Indians became optimistic about their future
 bhartiya rashtriyadhara main pashchimi shiksha ne saraahneey yogadan diya
 In 1825, on the suggestion of Lord Macaulay, English was the medium of instruction in India
 iskaa mukhya uddeshy bharat kii rashtriya chetana ko jad se nasht karnaa tha
 Rajni Pam Dutt has rightly written, "the purpose of introducing western education by British rule in India was to completely eradicate Indian civilization and culture and to create a class which is Indian by blood and color, But interest should become English with thoughts and words
 " is uddeshy main angrejon ko kaaphi seemaa tak safalataa bhi praapt hui, kyoki shikshit bhartiya log apni samskruti ko bhulakar paashchaatya samskruti kaa gungan karne lage
 But western education benefited India more than the loss
 isse bharat main rashtriya chetana jaagrit hui atah drushti se paashchaatya shiksha bharat ke liye ek vardaan siddh hui
 Due to knowledge of English language, Indian scholars studied the literature of Western countries
 jab unhone milton, bark, harbart spencer, jaan stuard mil aadi vichaarkon kii kritiyon kaa gyaan praapt hua, to uname swatantrata kii bhaavana jaagrit hui
 AR describing the impact of Western education on Indians
 Desai writes that "educated Indians read about the freedom struggles of America, Italy and Ireland
" unhone aise lekhakon kii rachanaaon kaa anushilan kiya, jinhone vyaktigat or rashtriya swadhinata ke siddhanton kaa prachaar kiya he
 These educated Indians became political and intellectual leaders of India's national movement
 " is sambandh main yah smaraneey he ki raja ram mohan raay, dada bhai nauroji, firoz shah mehta, gopal krishna gokhale, umesh chandra banerjee aadi netaa angreji shiksha kii hi dein hai
 The attitude of Indian leaders developed due to English education
 ucch shiksha praapt karne ke liye anek bhartiya igland gaye or vahaan ke swatantra vaataavaran se bahut prabhavit hue
 After coming to India, he encouraged the national movement because he wanted freedom in his country like European countries
 shri gurmukh nihalasinh likhte he ki "igland main rahane se unhen swatantra raajnneetik sansthaaon kii kaarividhi kaa vishisht gyaan praapt ho jaataa tha, ve swatantrata or swadhinata kaa mulya samaj jate the tathaa unke man me jami hui daastaa kii manovriti ghar kar jaati thi
 " angreji bhashaa lagu hone se purv bharat ke vibhinn praanton main bhinn-bhinn bhashaayen boli jaati thi
 So they could not understand each other's thoughts
 sampoorn bharat ke liye ek sampark bhashaa kii aavashyaktaa thi, jise angrej sarkaar ne angreji bhashaa lagukar puraa kar diya
 Now the residents of different provinces started thinking ideas among themselves and this inspired them to work together for the nation
 parinamswaroop rashtriya aandolan ko bal mila
 According to Sir Henry Cotton, "education through English medium and western civilization, despite the variations of the Indian people, served to bind the thread of unity
 ekta paidaa karanevaala anya koi tatva sambhav nahin tha, kyonki boli kaa bhram ek avichhin baadha thi
 Mr
 KM Panikkar writes, "the whole nation's education system and medium of education had such an impact on the mood of Indians that it was not difficult to have a cohesion of their thoughts, feelings and feelings
 parinamswaroop bhartiya rashtriyata kii bhaavana din pratidin prabal hoti gai
 " saransh yah he ki paashchaatya shiksha bharat ke liye vardaan siddh hui
 Dr
 Zakaria has rightly written, "the British started education in India more than 125 years ago, they have not done anything more beneficial in India
 “ isliye praayah yah kaha jaataa he ki bhartiya rashtriyata kii bhaavana pashchimi shiksha kaa poshan shishu tha
 In this way, Western education brought new life into the Indian national consciousness
 lard maikale ne 1833 i0 main kaha, ”angreji itihaas me vah garv kaa din haaga jab paashchaatya gyaan se shikshit bhartiya paashchaatya sansthaaon kii maang karenge
 “he never imagined that his dream would come true so soon
 munro ne likhaa he, ek swatantra press or videshi raaj ek duusare ke viruddh hai or ye donon ek saath nahin chal sakate
 This is true in Indian newspapers
 rashtriya aandolan kii pragati tathaa vikaas main bhartiya sahitya tathaa samachar patron kaa bhi kaaphi haath tha
 Through them, the nationalist elements continued to get strong inspiration and encouragement
 un dinon bharat main vibhinn bhashaaon main samachar patr prakashit hote the, jinamein raajnneetik adhikaron kii maang kii jaati thi
 In addition, the British government's repressive policy was also strongly criticized
 us samay prasiddh samachar patron main sanvaad kaumudi, bambai samachar, bangadoot, gastguftaar, amritabazaar patrika, tribune, indian mirar, hindu, patriot, bangalore, somprakash, kamred, new indian kesari, arya darshan evam bandhwa aadi ke naam vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai
 According to Phillips, in 1871 AD, there were 62 newspapers in the native language, Bombay Presidency and North India, and 28 and 20 newspapers in Bengal and South India respectively, with a regular readership of one lakh
 1877 i0 tak desh main prakashit honevaale samachar patron kii sankhya 644 tak ja pahaunchi thi, jinamein adhiktar deshi bhashaaon ke the
 The unjust policy of the British Government was severely criticized in these newspapers, so that a feeling of disgust and displeasure towards the British rule would arise among the common people
 isse rashtriya aandolan ko bal miltaa tha
 To curb the growing influence of these letters, the British Government passed the 'vernacular Press Act' in 1878, by which Indian newspapers were completely destroyed
 is act ne bhi rashtriya aandolan kii lahar ko tej kar diya
 Indian writers also contributed significantly in awakening the spirit of the country
 shri bankimachandra chatarji ne ‘vandemaataram’ ke rup me deshavaasiyon ko rashtriya gaan diya
 This awakened the feelings of patriotism among Indians
 marathi sahitya main shivaji kaa mughalon ke viruddh sangharsh videshi satta ke viruddh sangharsh bataaya gaya
 Mr
 Hemachandra Banerjee encouraged the sense of freedom through his national songs
 shri bipin chandra paal likhte he, ”rashtriya prem tathaa jaateey swabhimaan ko jaagrit karne main shri hemachandra dwaara rachit kavitaayen anya kaviyon kii aisi kavitaaon main kahin adhik prabhavotpadak thi
 "similarly Keshav Chandra Sen, Rabindra Nath Tagore, RC Dutt, Ranade, Dada Bhai Naoroji etc
 awakened the national spirit in India through their scholarly literature
 indra vidya vachaspati ke anusaar, isi samay micel madhusudan dutt ne bengal main, bharatendu harishchandr ne hindi main, narmad ne gujarati main, chiplunkar ne marathi main, bharti ne tamil main tathaa anya anek sahityakaron ne vibhinn bhashaaon main rashtriyata kii bhaavana se paripurna utkrisht sahitya kaa sajrun kiya
 These literary works have created an extraordinary enthusiasm for improvement and awakening in the hearts of Indians

 “this thing comes true on Indian nationality
 british sarkaar kii aarthik shoshan kii niti ne bhartiya udyogon ko bilkul nasht kar diya tha
 The British had complete authority over the trade here
 bhartiya vastuon par jo baahar jaati thi, baari kar laga diya gaya or bharat main aanevaale maal par british sarkaar ne aayaat par bahut chhot de di
 Apart from this, the British used to take raw materials from India, send goods manufactured by machines from England to India, which was much cheaper than the manufactured goods of small and cottage industries
 parinamswaroop bhartiya bazaar european maal se bhar gaye evam kutir udyog dhandhon kaa patan ho jane se karodon kii sankhya main log berozegaar ho gaye
 India's wealth was going abroad, so India became poorer day by day
 isliye 1880 i0 main sar wiliam digvi ne likhaa tha ki kareeb das karod manushya british bharat main aise he, jinhen kisi samay bhi bhar pet ann nahi miltaa, is adhampatan kii duusari misaal is samay kisi or unnatisheel desh main kahin par bhi dikhaai nahin de sakati he bharatiyon kii aarthik dasha ke bare main agli ke duk ne jo 1875

 An example of this is not found anywhere in the western world
 “ Due to the decline of industries and handicrafts, the people working in them went towards agriculture, which increased the pressure on the land
 parantu sarkaar ne krishi ke vaigyanik dhang kii ore koi dhyaan nahin diya jiske kaaran kisaanon kii dasha itani kharaab ho gai ki 75% vyaktiyon ko petbhar khaanaa bhi naseeb nahin hota tha
 Sudden splits of famines made his situation more pathetic
 wiliam hanter ne likhaa he, ”british samrajya main raiyat hi sabase adhik dayaneey he, kyonki unke maalik hi unke prati anyaayi he
 "in Fisher's words" millions of Indians are living on half-stomach food
 bharatiyon ke shoshan ke bare main di0i0 vaachaa ne likhaa he, ”bharatiyon kii aarthik sthiti british shashan kaal main adhik bigadi thi
 Four crore Indians had to be content with eating only during the day
 iskaa ek maatr kaaran yah tha ki england bhukhe kisaanon se bhi kar praapt karata tha tathaa vahaan par apana maal bhejkar laabh kamata tha
 The summary is that there was discontent among the Indian public against the economic exploitation of the British
 vah is shoshan se mukt hona chaahati thi
 Therefore, Indians started participating actively in the national movement
 gurmukh nihaal singh ke shabdon me ”is tathy ko asweekrut nahin kiya ja saktaa ki bigadati aarthik dasha tathaa sarkaar kii raashtra virdohi aarthik niti kaa angrej virdohi vichaardhaara tathaa rashtriya bhaavana ko jagaane main kaaphi haath tha

 According to this policy, they started seeing Indians with hatred
 gurumukh nihaal singh ke anusaar, ”vidroh ke baad bharat main aanevaale angrejon ke mastishk main bharatiyon ke bare main vibhinn dharanaayen hoti thi
 According to the then slave images of the stage, Indians were considered to be animals which were half-human and half-negro, which could only be explained by fear and for which the behavior of Jarnal Neel and his comrades with hatred and terror was appropriate
 " After the revolt of 1857, the British reduced contact
 unke nivas sthaan bharatiyon ke nivas sthaan se bilkul alag the
 They used to hate Indians as black people
 hotel, club, park aadi sthanon par angrej bharatiyon ke saath durvyavhaar karte the
 For this reason, the British committed many atrocities on Indians based on the policy of color discrimination
 garret ne is sambandh main likhaa he, "europiyanon kii jati vibhed niti teen mahatvapurn siddhanton par aadhaarit thi
 First, the life of a European is equal to that of many Indians, second, Indians can only understand the language of fear and punishment, and thirdly, Europeans came to India not only from the point of view of public interest but also for personal selfishness
 " In the case of justice also, caste discrimination was given place, different punishment was prescribed for Indians and British for the same crime
 angrejon ne anek bharatiyon kii hatyaayein kar daali, kintu unhen koi dand nahin diya gaya
 In this regard, Morrison wrote, "it is a great truth that cannot be hidden that the incident of killing of Indians by the British is not one or two

 Garrett has rightly written, "the sense of bitterness above was a major factor in the growth of Indian nationality
" “ The Charter Act of 1833 and Queen Victoria's declaration of 1858 AD stated that appointment to government jobs would be done only on merit
 bhartiya tathaa europiyanon ke bich kisi prakaar kaa bhedbhaav nahin bartaa jayega, lekin vyavhaar main is niti kaa paalan karne ke sthaan par ise bhang hi kar diya gaya
 Due to English education, a class of lawyers, doctors and teachers and job workers was born
 1857 ke vidroh ke baad british sarkaar kaa bharatiyon par se vishwaas samaapt ho gaya tha
 Therefore, she did not want to give government jobs to educated Indians, so she grew discontented

 For example, in 1869, Shri Surendra Nath Banerjee passed the ICS examination, but even after entering the service, the British Government had removed him from service on the slightest mistake

 Mr
 Banerjee has written in his autobiography that "my affairs caused great indignation in the hearts of Indians, the idea spread that if i were not an Indian, i would not have had to face so many hardships

 There was a system of giving Indian magistrates the right to hear and punish prosecutions against Europeans
 lekin yah vidheyak ek bheeshan vivaad kaa kaaran ban gaya
 The British living in India considered Ilbert Bill their ethnic insult

 Sir Henry Watton wrote in this regard that "some of the British of Calcutta conspired to subdue the rulers of the Government Building and bind Lord Ripon and send them back to England, and this all happened in the knowledge of the Governor and Police Commissioner of Bengal" The Ripon had to bow before the organized movement of the US and had to amend this bill

 In mathematics, the irrational number is a real number that is not rational, that is, cannot be expressed as a fraction p / q, where p and q are integers, in which q is non-zero and therefore not a rational number

 The concept of irrationality was introduced by Indian mathematicians in the seventh century BC
 Was implicitly accepted when humans believed that the square root of some specific numbers such as 2 and 61 cannot be definitively determined

 He did this by demonstrating that it is impossible to demonstrate that if the hypotenuse of an equilateral isosceles is actually proportional to an arm, that unit of measurement must be both even and odd, which is impossible

 However, Hipassus was not praised for his efforts: according to a legend, he made this discovery during a voyage and was later thrown out of the ship by Pythagorean companions "

 The magnitudes were in contrast to the numbers, which were bouncing from one value to another, such as 4 to 5
 The numbers are made up of some minimal, indivisible unit, while the magnitudes are infinitely reducible

 In the year 1872, several theories were published, including Karl Weierstrass, Hein, Georg Cantor, and Richard Dedekind
 In 1869 Meray took the same point of departure as Hein, but this theory is commonly cited from the year 1872

 Weierstras, Canter, and Hein based their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind put his bases on the notion of a deduction in a system of real numbers, under which he divided all rational numbers into two groups based on particular properties

 Continuous fractions, which are closely related to irrational numbers, received publicity at the hands of Euler and emerged more through Lagrang's writings in the early nineteenth century
 Dirichlet also contributed to general theory, as did many other contributors to the application of the subject

 Charles Hermit first proved the e-algebra and Ferdinand von Lindemann showed the same for π, starting with Hermit's conclusion
 Lindemann's evidence was greatly simplified by Weierstras, later primed by David Hilbert and finally by Adolf Hurwitz and Paul Albert Gordon

 The golden ratio is the next most famous quadratic irrational and there is a simple proof of his irrationality in his article
 sabhi gaiyr-varg prakritik sankhya kaa varg mul, aparimey he or dwighat aparimey main ek pramaan dekha ja saktaa he
 The irrationality of a square root of 2 can be proved by assuming it to be rational and concluding a contradiction, called an argument by reductio ad absurdum
 nimnlikhit tark is tathy se do baar apil karata he ki ek visham purnank kaa varg hameshaa visham hota he
 If √2 is rational, its form is m / n for integers m, n, where both are not even
 phir m 2 = 2n 2, isliye m sam he, kah lijiye ki m = 2p 
 is prakaar 4p 2 = 2n 2 isliye 2p 2 = n 2 isliye n bhi sam he, jo ek virodhabhas he
 The above proof for the square root of two can be generalized using the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which was proved in 1798 by Gauss
 isse yah bal miltaa he ki har purnank kaa abhajya main adwitiya gunankhandan hota he
 Using this we can show that if a rational number is not an integer, then its integral power cannot be an integer, because the denominator in its minimum term must have a factor that is not divisible by the numerator
 Be extended to any power
 So if an integer is not the exact kth power of another integer, then its kth square is irrational
 ve sankhyaayein jinhen sabase aasaani se aparimey sabit kiya jaataa he ve shaayad kuch khaas laghuganak he
 Here is a proof by reductio ad absurdum that log2 3 is irrational
 dhyaan den ki log2 3 ≈ 1
58> 0
 Suppose log2 3 is rational
 kuch dhanatmak purnank m or n ke liye, hamaare paas he it means that haalanki, sankhya 2 jise kisi bhi dhanatmak purnank ghaat main badhaayaa gaya ho use sam hona chahie or sankhya 3 ko jise kisi bhi dhanatmak purnank ghaat main badhaayaa gaya ho use visham hona chahie 
 jaahir he, ek purnank ek hi samay main sam or visham, donon nahin ho saktaa: hamaare paas ek virodhabhas he
 The only guess we made was that log2 3 is rational
 The contradiction means that this assumption must be false, ie log2 3 is irrational and can never be expressed as a quotient of integers m / n where n is ≠ 0
 log10 2 jaise maamalon ke saath bhi isi tarah kaa vyavhaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Almost all irrational numbers are transcendental and all transcendental numbers are irrational: the article with transcendental numbers lists several examples
 e r or πr aparimey hai agar r ≠ 0 parimey he; e π aparimey he
 Another way to construct irrational numbers is to construct irrational numbers as algebraic numbers, that is, as a polynomial with integer coefficients as zero: start with a polynomial equation
 jahaan gunank a i purnank hai
 Suppose you know that some real numbers x exist where p = 0
 The only possible rational root of this polynomial equation will be in the form r / s where r is a divisor of a 0 and s is a divisor of an; There are only a limited number of candidates that you can check with just hands
 agar unamem se koi bhi p kaa mul nahin he, to x zarur aparimey hona chahie
 For example, this technique can be used to show that x = 1 / 3 is irrational: we have 2 = 2 and therefore x 6 - 2x 3 - 1 = 0 and any rational in this latter polynomial
 Is not original
 kyonki bijiy sankhya ek kshetra gathit karte hai, kai aparimey sankhyaon ko bijiy or abijiy sankhyaon ke sangyojan dwaara nirmit kiya ja saktaa he
 For example 3π + 2, π + √2 and e √3 are irrational
 ek aparimey sankhya kaa dashamalav vistaar, ek parimey sankhya ke vipareet kabhi doharaata yaa samaapt nahin hota
 To show this, suppose we divide n integer by m
 When the longer part is applied to the part of n by m, only m remainder is possible
 yadi 0 ek sheshfal ke rup main prakat hota he, to dashamalav vistaar samaapt ho jaataa he
 If 0 never appears then that algorithm can run at most m - 1 step without using any remainder more than once
 uske baad, ek sheshfal kii punrariti honi hi chahie or tab dashamalav vistaar doharaata he
 Conversely, suppose we encounter a recurring decimal, then we can prove that it is a fraction of two integers
 udhaaharan ke liye: The length of the repeat is here 3
 ham 103 se guna karte hai: Note that when we multiplied by the length of the repeating part of 10, we moved the digits exactly to the left of the decimal point
 isliye, 1000A kaa pichhlaa sira bilkul a ke pichley sire se mail khaataa he
 Here, both 1000A and a have 162 repeats at the end

 antim pankti, 53 / 74, purnankon kaa ek bhagfal he or isliye ek parimey sankhya he
 Here is a well known pure existence or non-creative proof: vahaan do aparimey sankhyaayein a or b maujuud hai, is prakaar ki a b parimey he
 In fact, if √2√2 is rational, then suppose a = b = √2
 Otherwise, assume that a is an irrational number √2√2 and b = √2
 Then ab = √2 = 2√2 · √2 = √22 = 2 which is rational
 haalanki uparyukt daleel donon maamalon ke bich nirnay nahin karti, gelpond-shnyder prameya kaa taatpary he ki √2√2 abijiy he, isliye aparimey he
 It is not known whether π + e or π - e is irrational or not
 vastav main, vahaan gaiyr-shunya purnank m or n kaa koi yugma nahin he jiske bare main yah gyaat ho ki kya m π + ne aparimey he yaa nahin
 Furthermore, it is not known whether the set q is independent according to algebra

 Since the real constitutes an uncountable set, the rational of which is a countable subset, the complementary set of irrationals is uncountable
 saamaanya sudur kriya d = |x - y |, vaastavik sankhya ek metric spes he or isliye ek sansthitikeey spes bhi he
 Limiting the Euclidean remote function gives the irrational the structure of a metric space
 chunki aparimey kaa upspes band nahin he,utprerit metric purna nahin he
 However, with the G-delta set in a complete metric space - ie a countable intersection of open subsets - the irrational space is topologically complete: that is, a metric over the irrational that induces exactly the same topology as the Euclidean
 Restricts the metric, but with respect to which are irrational absolute
 ek vyakti G-delta set ke bare main upar ullikhit tathy se anbhigya rahete bhi ise dekh saktaa he: ek aparimey sankhya kaa satat bhinn vistaar, aparimey ke sthaan se sabhi dhanatmak purnank ke sthaan tak ek homeomorfizam ko paribhaashit karata he, jise aasaani se purna rup se metric yogya dekha jaataa he
 In addition, the set of all irrationals is a truncated metric space

 dharm or jati ke aadhaar par pruthak nirvaachika dene ke prabal virdohi gandhi ne ashanka jataai, ki achhuton ko di gayi pruthak nirvaachika, hindu samaaj ko vibhajit kar degi
 Gandhi felt that the Savarnas should be given some period of their heart-rending to forget untouchability, but this argument was proved wrong when untouchability continued to be practiced by the upper-caste Hindus even decades after the Poona Pact
 1932 main jab britishon ne ambedkar ke vichaaron ke saath sahmati vyakt karte huye achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene kii ghoshnaa kii

 lekin vahiin dalit varg apni duusari vot kaa istemaal karte hue saamaanya varg ke pratinidhi ko chunane se apni bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha

 "he also said that Gandhi is not an immortal person

 Of course, he also wanted that the economic condition of the Dalit society should improve, but not by being dependent on the money, but by their hard work and organization
 iske alaava ambedkar aise dharm ko chunanaa chaahate the jiskaa kendra manushya or naitikta ho, usamen swatantraaa, samta tathaa bandhutav ho

 avasthaa-samshti nirupan, gatikeey tantron ke kai prakaar ke nirupanon main se ek he
 In fact, it is a time-zone representation and is particularly useful for deliberations concerning the control of multi-input and multi-output dynamic systems
 iske alaava yah araikhik tantron or kaal-parivarti tantron ke vishleshan tathaa sanshleshan ke liye bhi upyogi he
 In this method of system representation, the state variables, inputs and outputs of the system are represented by first-order differential equations
 avasthaa kshetra model main do sameekaran hote hai - avasthaa sameekaran tathaa output sameekaran
 Compared to the frequency-field representation, the state-scale representation has the following advantages: 'avasthaa kshetra' yaa state-spes ek kaalpanik kshetra he jiske aksh avasthaa-char hai
 The state variables of the system in this space can be viewed as a vector
 kisi p input, q output tathaa n avasthaa-charon se yukt tantra ko is paddati main nimnlikhit prakaar se nirupit kiya jaataa he: Where called state vector, and is called output vector, u is called input vector, a is the parent of states, b is the input matrix, c is the output matrix and d All the matrices in the above representation can be variable with time, but if the system is linear and unchanging over time, then these matrices will be unchanging
 char samay t { \ displaystyle t} satat ho saktaa he yaa vivikt 
 In this case, the variable k { \ displaystyle k} is often used instead of time t { \ displaystyle t}
 jin tantron main satat parivarti tathaa vivikt rup se parivartit hone vaale avyav hote hai unako sankar tantra kehete hai
 Therefore, in different situations the form of the state-space model will be of the following type: kisi tantra ke avasthaa char uske puraane avasthaaon evam inputon se nirdhaarit hote hai
 In fact, if the old state x and input u are known over time, then the value of x can be calculated: us tantra ko niyantraneey kehete hai jisko, sweekaarya inputon ke madhyam se, kisi ek avasthaa se duusari avasthaa main simit samay main le jaaya ja saktaa he
 a continuous, time-invariant, linear state-model will be controllable if and only if- jahaan 'rank' kaa arth kisi matrix kii raikhik rup se swatantra panktiyon kii sankhya he
 That system is called 'observable' whose internal states can be calculated after knowledge of the outputs
 koi satat, kaal-aparivarti, raikhik avasthaa-model prekshniya hoga, yadi or keval yadi- The summary of the above discussion is that the meaning of control is that the input required to move that system from one state to another in a limited time is possible
 prekshaniyata kaa arth yah he ki yadi kisi tantra ke output gyaat hone par aanatarik avasthaaen nikaali ja saktin hai
