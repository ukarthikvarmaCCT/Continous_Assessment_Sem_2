 Anant means that there is no end
 isko ∞ se nirupit karte hai
 It is a concept in mathematics and philosophy that says an amount that has no limit or end
 bhootkaal main logon ne anant ke bare main tarah-tarah ke vichaar vyakt kiye hai
 The English synonym of the word infinity "infinity" is the treaty of 'inn' and 'finis' in the Latin language
 yah shabd un raashiyon ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa he jinaki bhaap athwa gananaa unke parimit na rahane ke kaaran asambhav he
 The infinite straight line length is borderless and therefore infinite
 ganitiya vishleshan main prachlit "anant" is prakaar vyakt kiya gaya he: If z is a variable and f is a function of Z, and if the variable is now moving towards a number, then f is increasing in such a way that it becomes larger and becomes larger than each given number
 No matter how large the loan is, it is said that the limit of f for z = a is infinite
 bhinnon kii paribhaasha se spasht he ki bhinn va / sa vah sankhya he jo sa se guna karne par gunanfal va detii he
 If neither of the z is zero, then the / c represents a unique amount
 phir spasht he ki 0 / sa sadaiv samaan rahata he, chaahe sa koi bhi saant sankhya ho
 This rational number is called zero and is equal to the countable number 0
 vipareetat:, va / 0 ek arthhin pad he
 It is a mistake to consider it infinite
 yadi k / ya main k achar rahata he or ya ghatata jaataa he or k, ya donon dhanatmak hai, to k / ya kaa maan badhata jayega
 If z leads to zero, eventually a / y will be larger than any larger number
 cantre ne anant kii samasya ko duusare dhang se vyakt kiya he
 Cantary numbers, which are sometimes called past numbers due to the contrast of the infinite and the infinite, are different from the definition of infinity prevalent in geometry and boundary theory
 cantre ne laghutam ateet gananaatmak sankhya a0 kii vyakhya prakritik sankhyaon 1, 2, 3


 ke sangh kii gananaatmak sankhya se kii he
 It seems that Indians were conceptualized as eternal since the Vedic period
 ve anant ke moolbhoot gunon ke parichit the tathaa iske liye kaii shabdon kaa prayog kiya gaya he, yatha - anant, purnan, aditi, asankhyat aadi
 The Myriad has been mentioned in the Yajurveda
 ishopanishad main yah aayaa he- Here 'purnasya Purnamaday Purnamevavishyate' is understood as such that even after subtracting the eternal from the infinite, the eternal remains

 He was selfish and arrogant and believed in the divine doctrine of the king

 Bismarck was forced to resign due to circumstances
 bismark ke patan ke uparaant wiliam ne samast satta ko apane haathon main liya or uske mantri aagyaakaari sevak ban gayi or vah swayan kaa shashan kaa karnadhaar bana
 William Kaiser was a very obstinate, ambitious and angry person
 vah kahata tha ki hamaara bhavishya samudr par nirbhar he
 His attempt to make Germany a maritime power had gained permanent hostility to England
 uski niti thi- 'sampurna vishwa par apana prabhutv sthapit karnaa
 'if he did not succeed in this, then he was ready for the destruction of the world
 vyapaarik desh hone ke kaaran england yuddh ke paksh main nahin tha, jise wiliam kaisar england kii kaayarta samajhataa tha
 He wanted to expand his empire by intimidating England in an aggressive attitude and it was a misconception that England would want to avoid war at any cost
 is prakaar wiliam kaisar ke ugr, samrajyavaadee, nirankush tathaa swechhachari vyaktitv ne europe ko mahayuddh ke kagaar par pahunchaa diya
 Caesar William II had the following three main objectives of world policy - uparokt uddeshyon kii purti karne ke abhipraay se kaisar wiliam dwitiya ne germany kii ‘videsh niti’ kaa sanchaalan karnaa aarambh kiya
 Due to the first objective, a close alliance with Austria was necessary, as he also wanted to move in the same direction and control the port of Salonika
 iskaa arth tha, madhya europe ke kootneetijna gut ko sudrudh bananaa
 Due to the conflict between the interests of Austria and Russia, it also meant the separation from Russia and finally making it their adversary
 duusare uddeshy kii purti kaa arth tha, 'sansar main jahaan kahin bhi aavashyak ho, visheshkar africa main, germany kii shakti kaa pradarshan karnaa
 'in this regard, Morocco challenged France twice in 1905 AD and 1911 AD
 tisare uddeshy kii purti kaa spasht parinaam tha england ke saath teevr pratisparddha or vaimnasy
 In summary, the natural consequence of this new policy was the hostility of Russia, France and England, and eventually the three of them converging in combat, that is, the destruction of all of Bismarck's work
 wiliam dwitiya ne apni niti se uski samast vyavastha ko nasht kar diya
 Within three years, Russia seceded from Germany and later ended her isolation by negotiating a treaty with France
 6 varsh ke andar england shatru ban gaya
 The hostility from France intensified with the intervention of Morocco, and by 1907, the Triassic Friendship of France, Russia and England was established in comparison with the threesome of Germany, Austria and Italy
 italy kaa trigut se sambandh bhi shithil padataa ja rahaa tha kintu wiliam dwitiya ne is disha main koi prayaas nahin kiya
 The Rehabilitation Treaty was to be repeated in 1890 AD by Bismarck in Germany and Russia, while William wanted to establish stronger ties with Austria than Russia so that he could succeed in bringing the eastern Mediterranean into his sphere of influence through the Balkans
 
 rus ne bhi is punaraashwaasan sandhi kii punrariti ko yah kahkar manaa kar diya ki 'sandhi badi pechida he or isamen austria ke liye dhamkee maujuud he jiske bade anishtakaari parinaam ho sakate hai
 ' punaraashwaasan sandhi kii punrariti ke na hone kaa spasht parinaam yah hua ki rus akelaa rah gaya
 It became mandatory for him to search for a friend to overcome his isolation
 abusake saamne uske shatru england or france hi the
 But being forced by his situation, he was attracted to befriend France and tried to befriend him
 ant main, 1895 i
 main donon deshon main sandhi hui jo dwigut sandhi ke naam se prasiddh he
 France was greatly benefited by this treaty and her loneliness ended
 wiliam bada mahatvakankshi tha
 He wanted to make Germany not only the fortune-maker of Europe, but the fortune-maker of the world
 bismark vishwa ke jhagadon se germany ko alag rakhana chahta tha,kintu wiliam ne europe ke baahar ke jhagadon main hastkshep karnaa aarambh kar diya
 He was not satisfied with German influence only in the Balkan Peninsula, but he wanted to see him as a world power
 isi uddeshy ke liye 1890 i
 ke uparaant germany kii vaideshik niti main vishwa-vyapee niti kaa samavesh hua
 Many of William's speeches reflect his views
 usne in pradeshon ko apane adhikaar main kiya - William wanted to bring Turkey under his sphere of influence and was a major part of his world policy
 england bhi is ore prayatnsheel tha
 He did not want to allow the dominance of any European nation to be established in Turkey, as this could have caused fear to his Indian empire
 1878 i
 kii berlin-congress tak turki par england kaa prabhutv rahaa or jab kabhi bhi kisi europea rastra ne us ore pragati karne kaa vichaar kiya to england ne uskaa datakar virodh kiya, parantu cyprus ke samjhaute ke uparaant uskaa prabhaav turki par se kam hone laga
 When England took control of Egypt in 1882 AD, the goodwill that existed between England and Turkey started to end
 ab wiliam dwitiya ne is paristhiti kaa laabh uthaakar turki ko apane prabhaav-kshetra main laane kaa praytn kiya
 In this regard, he took the following measures: kustuntuniya tak rail banane kaa bhi tha
 The opening of this route would have exposed Germany to the Persian Gulf, which would have become a matter of special concern for the Indian Empire of England
 wiliam turki ko apni ore aakarshith karne main avashya safal hua, kintu usne apni is niti se rus, france or england ko apana shatru bana liya jabaki turki kii shakti in teenon bade rashtron ke saamne naganya thi
 This policy of William cannot be called a successful policy
 usne teenon raashton ko ek saath aprasann kiya jiskaa parinaam yah hua ki tridaleey gut kaa nirmaan sambhav ho gaya
 By 1890, Germany and England had a good relationship, but when Germany started adopting a worldwide policy during the reign of William II, relations between Germany and England began to get tighter
 bismark ke pad tyaag karne ke uparaant wiliam ne germany kii nausena main vistaar karnaa aarambh kiya to england germany kii badhati hui shakti se sashankit hone laga tha
 For some time, the friendship of both of them increased, but after 1896 AD, the relationship between the two started getting bitter
 jab wiliam ne transwaal ke rastrapati cruger ko james ke akraman par vijay praapt karne ke upalaksh main badhai kaa taar bheja
 This wire created a great disarray among the people of England
 maharani victoria ne bhi apane pautra wiliam dwitiya ke is kaary kii badi ninda kii
 At this time England did not think it right to spoil relations with Germany, because he would have been left alone
 isi uddeshy kii purti ke liye usne germany se achche sambandh sthapit karne kaa praytn kiya
 Agreements between the two countries were also made with respect to Africa in 1898 AD and regarding armies in 1899 AD
 usee varsh england ke upnivesh mantri joseph chemberlen ne england, germany or sanyukt rajya ke ek trigut ke nirmaan kaa prastaav kiya, kintu 1899 i
 main bulo ne jo is samay germany kaa pradhanmantri tha, is prastaav ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 The reason for his rejection of this proposal was that it meant England to take the side of Germany in the ensuing wars and take part in the war as its supporter, and England settled from the European continent in Asia and Africa
 The empire continued to expand
 bulo kaa yah vichaar tha ki germany kii aupniveshik, vyapaarik tathaa navik unnati se england ko asuvidha hona anivaary thi or kabhi bhi donon main yuddh chhid saktaa he
 Therefore, it was well understood by the policies of Germany that over-trusting Germany would prove fatal for England and indeed a day would come when England and Germany would go to war
 france or rus ke madhya mitrataa kii sthapana ho chuki thi, ab france dwaara rus or england kii mitrataa kaa kaary aarambh hua
 In 1907, with the efforts of France, the faction of Russia and England became ready

 Now he particularly attracted his attention towards the end of this group
 isi samay germany ko purvi samasya main hastkshep karne tathaa rus ko apamaanit karne kaa avasar praapt hua
 1908 AD There was a movement in Turkey which is known as the Young Turk Movement

 Austria dealt with Serbia very harshly, which made the war seem inevitable, but when Germany made a clear declaration that if Russia would help Serbia in any way, it would be able to fully support Austria in the war

 At this time, Russia did not have the power to successfully counter the combined services of Germany and Austria
 rus ko baadhya hokar dab janaa padaa or german raajnneeti balkan prayadweep main safal hui
 Although the german-emperor William Kaiser succeeded in demoralizing Russia in the Balkan region and was able to expand the power and influence of his friend Austria, he remained fearful of the factions of France, Russia and England
 usne france or rus se mitrataa karne kii ore haath badhanaa aarambh kiya
 On 8 February 1909, he entered into an agreement with France, according to which France accepted the principle of independence and integrity of Morocco
 germany ne morocco kii aantarik suraksha ke sambandh main france kii asaadhaaran sthiti maan lee
 Convinced here, Germany drew its attention to compromise with Russia
 germany ne rus se navambar 1910 main mesopotamia or faras main apane hiton ke sambandh main samjhauta kiya, jiske dwaara 'rus ne germany ko berlin-baghdad railway kii yojana kaa virodh na karne kaa vachan diya or wiliam ne faras main rus ke hiton kii sweekruti pradaan kii
 ' uparokt kaaryo dwaara wiliam dwitiya rus, france or england ke gut ko nirbal karne main safal hua, kintu yah sthiti adhik kaal tak sthaayee nahin rah saki
 France and Germany attempted to address the Moroccan question, but both were not satisfied with the status of the agreement
 ‘morocco kii swatantraaa’ tathaa france kii police satta main swaabhaavik virodh tha jiske kaaran bhavishya main jhagada hona nishchit tha
 France was bent on bringing Morocco completely under its control and Germany was determined to stop it or to receive a suitable reward in return
 1911 i 
 main morocco main ek aisi ghatana ghati jisane europe ke pramukh rashtron kaa dhyaan us ore aakarshith kiya
 The fire of civil war ignited in Morocco and the Sultan of Morocco failed to suppress the rebellion
 is paristhiti ke utpann hone par france ne aantarik suraksha ke liye apane uttardaayitv kaa bahaanaa lekar ek sena bheji, jisane 21 may 1910 i
 ko morocco main vidroh kaa daman karnaa aarambh kar diya
 Germany could not tolerate such interference from France, and Germany's foreign minister declared that 'if France found it necessary to stay in Morocco, then the full problem of Morocco would be reconsidered and all the powers that signed the Algysiraj Act The freedom to work as per his wish will be regained
 ' vidraahiyon ke daman ke uparaant france kii senaayen vaapis lautne lagi, kintu is par bhi germany ne apane kade vyavhaar main kisi prakaar parivartan karnaa uchit nahin samajha
 In July 1910 AD, Germany announced that it had sent a warship to the port called Ezir in southern Morocco for the purpose of protecting German interests and German residents
 germany ke is vyavhaar ne badi sankatmay paristhiti utpann kar di or yah sambhaavna spasht drushtigochar hone lagi ki sheeghra hi europe ke raashton ke madhya yuddh kaa hona anivaary he
 Finally, a treaty was signed between France and the Germans, which was concluded on 4 November 1911, according to which it was decided that France's patronage over Morocco would continue and Germany received half the territory of the French Congo
 morocco ke prashn par germany ko munh kii khaani padi, kyonki rus, france or england kaa trirashtiy gut pehle kii apeksha ab adhik drudh tathaa sthai ho gaya tha tathaa germany or england ke sambandh din-pratidin kharaab hone aarambh ho gaye
 In the context of mathematics, a group of multiple equations containing more than one variable is called a simultaneous equation
 'yugapat' kaa arth he - 'ek saath'
 By performing mathematical operations on the given equations, we derive a value of all the variables that satisfy them
 Obtaining the value of these variables is called the solution of the simultaneous equation

 Bihari Lal or Bihari was a famous poet of the Hindi customs
 biharilal kaa janm sanwat 1595 ke aasapaas gwalior main hua
 He belonged to the Mathur Choubey community
 unke pita kaa naam keshavaray tha
 When Bihari was 8 years old, his father brought him to Orchha and his childhood was spent in Bundelkhand
 inke guru keshavadas the or yuvavastha sasuraal mathura main vyateet hui, jaise kii nimna dohe se prakat he - jaipur-king Sawai Jai Singh was so immersed in the love of his new queen that he did not even leave the palace and paid no attention to the royal palace
 mantri aadi log isse bade chintit the, kintu raja se kuch kehane ko shakti kisi main na thi
 Bihari took this task on himself
 unhone nimnlikhit doha kisi prakaar raja ke paas pahunchaaya - This couplet acted like a mantra on the king
 ve rani ke prem-pash se mukt hokar punah apana raaj-kaaj sanbhaalane lage
 He was so impressed with the poetic efficiency of Bihari that he asked Bihari to create more couplets and pledged to give one Asharfi per couple
 bihari jaipur naresh ke darbar main rahakar kavy-rachana karne lage, vahaan unhen paryaapt dhan or yash mila
 The only creation of Bihari is Satsai
 yah muktak kavy he
 It contains 719 couplets
 katipay dohe sandigdh bhi maane jate hai
 All the couplets are beautiful and admirable, however, when looked at closely, about 200 couplets are very excellent
 'satsai' main brajabhasha kaa prayog hua he
 Braj Bhasha was at that time recognized as a well-known and all-poet-revered poetical language of North India
 iskaa prachaar or prasar itnaa ho chukaa tha ki isamen anekarupata kaa aa janaa sahaj sambhav tha
 Bihari made a successful attempt to keep it with uniformity and kept it in definite literary form
 isse brajabhasha manjkar nikhar uthi
 Satsai can be divided into three main parts - policy-oriented, devotional and spiritual-minded, and aristocratic
 inamen se shringaaraatmak bhaag adhik he
 Kalachamatakara is attained with tact everywhere
 shringaaraatmak bhaag main roopang saundarya, saundaryopkaran, nayak-nayikabhed tathaa haav, bhav, vilaas kaa kathan kiya gaya he
 The hero-heroine is also found mainly in three forms - the protagonist is Krishna and the heroine Radha in the first form
 inkaa chithran karte hue dharmik or darshanik vichaar ko dhyaan main rakhaa gaya he
 Therefore, in this deep sense is the chief, and there is spiritual mystery and religion; In the second form, Radha and Krishna are not explicitly mentioned, but their appearance is illuminated and the idealized images are presented with a bizarre euphemism
 isse isamen loukik vaasana kaa vilaas nahin miltaa
 Loksambhava Nayaka in the third form is a clear picture of the heroine
 isamen bhi kalpana kala kaushal or kavi paramparaagat aadarshon kaa put purna rup main praapt hota he
 The absolute cosmic form is very short and very short
 'satsai' ke muktak dohon ko krambaddh karne ke prayaas kiye gaye hai
 There are 25 types of sequences, out of which 14 types of sequences have been seen, the remaining 11 types of sequences which are in vaccines are not received
 kintu koi nishchit kram nahin diya ja sakaa
 In fact, it seems that these couplets were composed from time to time, then selected and collected and collected
 keval mangalacharnatmak dohon ke vishay main bhi isi se vichaar vaichity he
 If the idea of 'mere Bhav Baad Harau' is the first invocation of this couplet i
e
 only Radhopasak, and if 'peacock Mukut Kati Kachhini' - take this couplet, then only a special Banakwali Krishnamurti will be the main idol of Bihari
 Bihari was actually a Krishnopasak, it is clear
 satsai ke dekhne se spasht hota he ki bihari ke liye kavy main ras or alankaar chaaturya chamatkaar tathaa kathan kaushal donon hi anivaary or aavashyak hai
 In such a way, they can put their couplets in two classes, in one class they will come in couplets which have the preponderance of Rasa Rourkarya and special attention has been given to the spirituality
 alankaar chamatkaar inamen bhi he kintu vishesh pradhan nahin, varan ras pariposhkata or bhavotkarshakta ke liye hi sahaayak rup main yah he
 In the second category, there are couplets which do not give characterization to spirituality, but preeminence is given to ornament miracles and utterances or utterances
 kisi vishesh alankaar ko uktivaichitrya ke saath safalataa se nibaaha gaya he
 In this way, it is to be believed that the miracle of miracle has not been forgotten
 ras ko utkarsh dete hue bhi alankaar kaushal kaa apakarsh bhi nahin hone diya gaya
 Thus it should be said that Bihari Rasalankarasiddha was a poet; Not only niti vishyak dohon main vastut: sarasata rakhana kathin hota he, unamem uktiauchity or vachanavakrata ke saath chaaru chaaturya chamatkaar hi prabhavotpadak or dhyanakarshan main sahaayak hota he
 This is clearly found in the strategic couplets
 phir bhi bihari ne inamen sarasata kaa saraahneey prayaas kiya he
 The same thing also comes in the submission of philosophical principles and religious sentiments because they naturally have their own differences
 phir bhi bihari ne unhen sarasata ke saath prastut karne main safalataa pai he
 Heartfelt expressions of devotion are rarely seen in couplets
 samyavastha vishesh main bihari ke bhavuk hriday main bhakthibhaavna kaa udai hua or uski abhivyakti bhi hui
 In Bihari, there is no predominance of daily sentiment, they pray to God, but not inferiorly
 prabhu kii ichha ko hi mukhya maanakar vinay karte hai
 Bihari has taken inspiration from the liberated compositions of his predecessor Siddha poets, such as Aryasaptashati, Gathasaptashati, Amarukashatak, etc
 - Some of them have been cut and beautiful in the form of expressions, some have been upgraded and some have been kept as they are
 saundarya yah he ki deergh bhaavon ko sankshipt rup main ramyata ke saath apni chhap chhodte hue rakhane kaa safal prayaas kiya gaya he
 Many poets and writers wrote commentaries on 'satsai'
 kul 54 tikaayen mukhya rup se praapt hui hai
 Ratnakar ji's vaccine is in a way the last vaccine, it is very beautiful
 satsai ke anuwaad bhi sanskrit, urdu aadi main hue hai or katipay kaviyon ne satsai ke dohon ko spasht karte hue kundalia aadi chhandon ke dwaara vishishtikrut kiya he
 Bhavasamya is also revealed along with other earlier poets
 kuch tikaayen farsi or sanskrit main likhi gayi hai
 The commentators have also kept the sequence of couplets in Satsai with their own views
 saath hi dohon kii sankhya bhi newnaadhik di he
 It is not entirely certain how many couplets were composed
 sambhav he, jo satsai main aae ve chunakar aae kul dohe 700 se kahin adhik rache gaye honge
 Bihari has composed so many couplets throughout his life, it is not completely valid
 'satsai' par katipay aalochakon ne apni aalochanaayen likhi hai
 It has been criticized since its poetry
 pratham kaviyon ne satsai kii maarmik visheshta ko sankethik rup se suchit karte hue dohe or chand likhe
 Urdu poets did likewise

 There were many commentaries of this book and many poets based their couplets and composed verses like Kavitta, Chappaya, Savaiya etc
 bihari satsai aaj bhi rasik janon kaa kavy-haar bani hui he
 Due to the power of imagination and the power of language, the words of Satsai to fill the sea in the couplets of Gagar indicate
 unke vishay main thik hi kaha gaya he - Due to its poetic qualities, Bihari is counted in the category of Mahakavis even if he did not compose the epic

 tatvamimasaa par prabal akraman kiye gaye
 For this, some schools took shelter of religion and psychology, some of cognition, some of science and logical analysis
 phir tatvamimasaa ke siddhant nae str par sthapit kiye gaye
 Examples are Samuel Samuel, Nikolai Hartmann and Alfred North Whitehead
 dharmik anubhavon, evam manovaigyanik satyon ko wiliam james ne paryaapt mahatv diya
 James severely criticized Hegel's predetermined and sedentary world
 unke anusaar vaastaviktaa parivartanshal he or iskaa gyaan samvednaaon ke madhyam se hi ho saktaa he
 As a result, the theory of consciousness was presented
 desh kaal kii vaastaviktaa ko hi vaastaviktaa sweekaar kar liya gaya
 James propounded the principle of "desire to believe", according to which, the criterion of faith is success, not fact
 is vichaardhaara ko vyaavhaariktawaad yaa pregmatism kehete hai
 The reality imagined in it inspires towards tradeism, opportunism and selfishness
 jaan divi, shiller, charles piers or swayan james is vichaardhaara ke prasiddh vyaakhyaata the
 The French philosopher Henri Bergsan praised James's approach

 But due to giving more importance to the fantasies of God, soul, heaven etc
, they despise material life and cannot be called existentialists

 Edmund Husserl developed it primarily based on the ideas of Franz Brantano

 pratibhasavaadiyon main maiks shae kaa naam ullekhneey he
 According to this theory, philosophy is manifestation
 pratibhaas se arth he, jo bhi pradutt vastu pratyakshanubhuti kaa vishay banati ho
 As a result, in contrast to natural science, adopting war also differs from co-suffixism
 pratibhasawad, gyanamimasaa se adhyayan prarambh nahin karata
 The second feature is that paradigmism selects essences as themes
 ye saratatv pratibhaasi adarsh evam bodhgamy hote hai
 They are left in the mind in the act of anticipation, which is why it is also called philosophy of essence
 edmund husarl franz brantano ke atirikt, scholestisism, navy kaantwaad aadi kaa prabhaav spasht he

 The way we see things in consciousness, that is their meaning, this is called the gift, because it is reflected in consciousness
 pratibhasawad main pratibhaason ke atirikt kisi agyeya tatv ko mahatv nahin diya gaya he

 After studying metaphysics from the method of "authentication", it was said that all its sentences are "meaningless"
 ishwar, aatma, amarta aadi ko pramanit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The job of philosophy is not to search for reality, but to study scientific sentences

 In existentialism, death is considered the starting point of philosophy
 yaspers ke anusaar darshaniktaa kaa arth he yah siikhnaa ki ham kaise mrityu ko praapt hon
 Hedgar's "inspiration of death" and Satra's "nasia" are its other forms
 isi ko kehete hai ki astitvvaad kii samasya aadmi kii astitvaparak samasya he
 According to this school, "existence" is the basic object of study
 astitv kii paribhaasha praaia: logon ne alag alag di he
 But according to all this, existence is nothing other than the existence of man
 aadmi swayan apana astitv he

 Man makes his own construction and this construction proves his freedom

 Others imagine God differently

 The basic tone of existentialism is pessimistic
 jivan ke nishedhatmk pakshon par hi usamen adhik vichaar kiya gaya he
 It is generally accepted that the man is destitute and is in the extreme determined by his circumstances
 unki adhiktar paribhaashaayen aspasht or gadhe hue muhaavaron ke kaaran asampreshnty evam duruh hoti gai hai
 In a sense, it describes experiences with excesses

 sanathan samskruti kii aatma shrikrishna ko upasya ke rup main sthapit karne vaale nimbarkacharya vaishnavacharyon main pracheenatam maane jate hai
 Nimbarkacharya, who instituted the duetopasana of radha-krishna, was born on Kartik Purnima
 bhakton kii manyatanusaar acharya nimbark kaa aavirbhaav-kaal dwaparant main krishna ke praputra bajranabh or parakshit putr janamejay ke samakaleen bataaya jaataa he
 The presence of his father Arun Rishi, in the Shrimad Bhagwat, has been specially mentioned in many places, including the passage of Parikshit's Bhagavatak and Shravan
 haalanki aadhunik shodhakarta nimbark ke kaal ko vikram kii 5veen sadi se 12veen sadi ke bich siddh karte hai
 According to the belief of the sect, they are considered to be the incarnation of 'sudarshan', the principal armament of God
 inkaa janm vaiduryapattan ke arunashran main hua tha
 His father was Arun Muni and his mother's name was Jayanthi
 janm ke samay inkaa naam niyamanand rakhaa gaya or balykaal main hi ye braj main aakar bas gaye
 According to the rules, Niyamananda made the foothills of Govardhan his place of worship under the orders of his Guru Narada
 bachapan se hi yah balak bada chamatkaari tha
 Once, a Diwabhoji Yeti came to his ashram in Govardhan
 swaabhaavik rup se shaastra-charchaa hui par isamen kaaphi samay vyateet ho gaya or suryaast ho gaya
 Yeti started eating without food
 tab balak niyamanand ne neem ke vriksh kii ore sanket karte hue kaha ki abhi suryaast nahin hua he, aap bhojan karke hi jaaen
 But as soon as Yeti woke up with food, he saw that two o'clock in the night had passed
 tabhi se is balak kaa naam ‘nimbark’, yani nim par arq ke darshan karaane vaala, ho gaya
 Nimbarkacharya presented his overall philosophy by writing his commentary on the Brahmasutra, the Upanishads and the Gita
 inaki yah tikaa 'vedant parijaat saurabh' ke naam se prasiddh he
 His opinion is known as 'dvaitaadvaita' or 'bhedabhed'
 acharya nimbark ke anusaar jeev, jagat or brahm main vaastavik rup se bhedabhed sambandh he
 Nimbark considers the existence of these three to be different due to their nature, qualities and expression, and because of being essentially one, they consider all three to be integral
 nimbark ke anusaar upasya radhakrishna hi purna brahm hai
 dr
sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, in his well-known book 'bharatiya Darshan', while referring to Nimbarka and his Vedanta philosophy, wrote that in the view of Nimbarka, devotion means love rather than worship
 prabhu sadaa apane anurakt bhakt ke hit saadhan ke liye prastut rahete hai
 Devoted deeds are the only means of attaining Brahm Gyan
 salemabad ke radhamadhav mandir, vrundavan ke nimbark-kot, nimgaanv sahit bharat ke vibhinn hisson main nimbark jayanti vishesh samaaroh purvak manaai jaati he

 Ashtachhap was a group of 8 devotional poets founded by Mahaprabhu Sri Vallabhacharya ji and his son Shri Vitthalnathji, who through their various positions and kirtans, glorified the various pastimes of Lord Shri Krishna
 ashtchhaap kii sthapana 1565 i0 main hui thi
 Under the Ashtchap poets, there were four principal disciples of the poetical poetess of Pushtimargiya Acharya Vallabh and his son Vithalnath
 aathon brijabhoomi ke nivasee the or shrinathi ke samaksh gaan rachakar gaaya karte the
 His collection of songs is called "ashtachhap", which literally means eight strings
 unhone brajabhasha main shrikrishna vishyak bhakthiraspurn kavitaayen rachin
 After him, all Krishna devotee poets started writing poems in Braj language
 ashtchhaap ke kavi jo huye hai, ve is prakaar se hai:- Surdas was prominent among these poets

 These people were also called Bhagwadiyas because they were the ultimate Bhagwat

 sanyukt rajya america se itar deshon main americakaran kaa matlab america samskruti kaa anya deshon kii samskruti par prabhaav se he
 The term has been in use since at least 1907
 'americakaran' ke vichaar kaa prachlit arth america media companiyon ke vishwa-prabhutv kii aalochana kii dein he
 Broadly, it is also seen as synonymous with culture-industry and cultural imperialism
 lekin aise bhi kuch pahalu hai jo americakaran ko in donon se alag karte hai
 Chief among these is the use of expression of Americanization by European cultures
 pashchimi europe ke amir desh vaise to raajnneeti, arthniti or samarniti main america ke abhinn sahyogi hai, par samskruti ke sandarbh main ve iske dwaara sanyukt rajya america kii samskruti ke prasaravaadi charitra par aapatti karte hai
 From this point of view, Americanization is also a reflection of the contradictions of the capitalist cultural camp
 frans, germany or italy jaise ji-saat deshon kii manyata he ki television kaaryakramon, hollywood kii filmon, pop music or khan-paan ke madhyam se america vichaardhaara, jivan-style or pravritiyaan unke apane saanskrithik mulyon or paramparaon ko prishthbhumi main dhakele de rahi hai
 For example, critics in Italy are concerned that their people are increasingly adopting the music-dance tradition of Michael Jackson instead of pasta and hamburger instead of opera
 isi tarah apni bhashaa ko sabase shreshth maanane kii khuraaq par paley francoisiyon or germanon ko yah dekhakar saanskrithik dar sataane lage hai ki america rutabe ke kaaran angreji kaa bauddhik or saanskrithik prabhaav badhata ja rahaa he
 The same meaning of Americanization is gradually being adopted by the advocates of Asian cultures as an important idiom for criticizing globalization
 bhoomandaleekaran ke aalochakon ke bich 'cocacolizeshan' yaa 'macdenalineeshan' jaise muhaavaron kaa aksar istemaal hota he
 Fears of the contagious character of American culture have been expressed long before the globalization process began
 majdoor varg kii samskruti ke drushtikon se british samajashastri or 'barmingham centre for da cultural studies' ke sansthaapak richard hogart kii 1957 main prakashit rachana 'da yuziz of literysi' ne americakaran kii vistrut aalochana pesh kii thi
 Hogart compared American and British popular novels, alleging that American novels used sex and violence in context
 pachaas ke dashak ke british ‘milk baron’ ke vishleshan ke zariye hogart ne angrej yuvakon par america ke asar kii shinaakht karte hue dikhaaya ki unke bich america style main ‘modern’ or ‘kool’ hona kis tarah tarah prachlit hota chalaa gaya
 Hogart had no doubt that these cultural winds coming from America are 'anti-life'
 yah ek rochak tathy he ki americakaran kii jis prakriya par europee desh aaj aapatti kar rahe hai, usne apana aadhaar dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad or sheet yuddh ke dauraan praapt kiya tha
 In a way, this Americanization was the necessity of Europe that had been shackled by the World War
 yahi vah daur tha jab america bijness model ne euro ke sthaneey vyapaarik praroopon ko apni safalataa ke kaaran peeche dhakel diya
 The MBA degree for business management was previously awarded only in the US, but today this degree is synonymous with skilled business-management worldwide, including Europe
 america dwaara pravartit ‘dakshata andolan’ europee deshon kii aarthik or bauddhik samskruti dwaara kam se kam saath-sattar saal pehle hi aatmsaat kar liya gaya tha
 During the consolidation of this movement, not only increased productivity was achieved in Europe through machines and factories, but also greatly improved the standard of living of the middle class and the working class
 is andolan ko germany main naziyon or europe ke anya hisson main communiston dwaara akraman kaa nishaanaa banaaya gaya, lekin uski saamaajik sweekruti ek asandigdh tathy ban chuki he
 How the flow of business culture from America has been one-sided can be evident from the statistics of investment
 1950 se 1965 ke bich europe main america nivesh aath sau pratishat badha, jabaki isi dauraan europe kaa america main nivesh keval 15 se 28 fisadi tak hi bad sakaa
 The role of US technological superiority has also been behind the tremendous increase in US investment
 sheet-yuddh kii samaapti ke baad ab pashchimi europe ko soviet kheme kii taraf se kisi prakaar kaa sainik khatra nahin rah gaya he
 That is, he no longer needs America as his protector
 europee sangh kii rachana bhi ho chuki he, or europe ekikrut aarthik sanrachana ke rup main america se hode kar rahaa he
 As a result of this new situation, there have been objections to American investment, American advertisements, business practices, employee policies and the use of the English language by American companies
 isaki shuruyaat frans se hui thi jiskaa prasar ab saare gaiyr-angreji bhashi europe main ho chukaa he
 European critics are puzzled to see that America presents itself as a more democratic, classless and modern culture than the political elite of European societies
 iske jawaab main in aalochakon kaa daawa he ki america prabhaav raajnneetik or saanskrithik daayaron main europee samaajon kii abhiruchiyon ko bhrasht kar rahaa he
 However, Americanization was not always negative
 iske sakaaratmak pahaluon kii pahchaan beesvin sadi ke pehle dashak se kii ja sakati he
 Since 1907, it has been cited within America as a process of adopting American customs and trends by communities living there from other cultures of the world
 is silsile ko ‘melting pot’ kii parighatna ke taur par bhi dekha jaataa he
 In 1893 the historian Frederick Jackson Turner used this concept for the first time in an article to show that American culture and other institutions were not merely the product of anglo-saxon peoples
 unhen rachane main europe se america main basane aayi tarah-tarah kii samskritiyon kaa yogadan he
 After this, the phrase melting pot gradually became popular as a synonym for cultural assimilation
 yahan yah ullekh karnaa aavashyak he ki bauddhik kshetron main bhi america samskruti ke prabhaavon ko sabhi pakshon dwaara nakaaratmak drushti se nahin dekha jaataa
 Some scholars active in the field of culture studies are of the view that instead of looking at the market culture with a low view, the reality of the assimilation by ordinary people should be reviewed positively
 inkaa daawa he ki america saanskrithik utpaadon se jan-maanas kii muthbhed ekangi nahin balki vibhedikrut or vividhtamoolak he
 Hebdigi, in his 1979 work, has shown how British working class youth have incorporated resistance into their relatively powerless and subordinate class status with the help of American fashion and music
 america british yuvakon ke liye ek aadhunik, unmukt or romani samskruti kaa aakarshak drishy prastut karata he
 Such scholars, drawn from culture studies, analyzed American TV serials such as 'dallas' and 'dynasty' and found that the conclusions reached by people watching them have a profound impact on the local environment
 udaahranarth, ‘dalas’ dekhne vaala arab darshak use pashchimi patanshiltaa ke udhaaharan ke rup main grahan karata he, jabaki ek roosi yahudee use poonjeewaad kii atmalochna maan kar chalata he
 According to these scholars, to consider America as a dominating power does not mean that it is also considered as a force to impose its final decision on the cultural identity of the world
 ye log saanskrithik pravahon ko ekatarfa nahin maanate, balki america hawaaon ke mukaable bharat ke bollywoodiya manoranjan, laathini america ke ‘telenowell’ or japani tivi utpaadon kaa zikr karte hai
 These scholars have also argued that the availability of satellite licenses at a cheaper rate has greatly diversified the underlying politics of making TV programs
