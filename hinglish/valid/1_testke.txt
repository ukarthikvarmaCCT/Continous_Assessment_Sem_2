 Who discovered the law of gravity and the principle of motion

 His research form "mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy" was published in 1687, in which the laws of universal gravitation and motion were explained and thus laid the foundation of sustainable physics
 unki philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica, 1687 main prakashit hui, yah vigyaan ke itihaas main apane aap main sabase prabhaavshaalee pustak he, jo adhikansh saahitiyik yantriki ke liye aadharbhoot kaary kii bhoomika nibhaati he
 In this work, Newton described three laws of universal gravitation and motion that dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries
 newton ne darshaya ki prithvi par vastuon kii gati or akashiya pindon kii gati kaa niyantran prakritik niyamon ke samaan samucchy ke dwaara hota he, ise darshane ke liye unhone grahiy gati ke kepler ke niyamon tathaa apane gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke bich nirantarata sthapit kii, is prakaar se surya kendriyata or vaigyanik kranti ke aadhunikeekaran ke bare main pichley andeh ko dur kiya
 In mechanics, Newton established the principles of conservation of both momentum and angular momentum
 prakaashiki main, unhone pehla vyavhaarik paravarti doordarshee banaaya or is aadhaar par rang kaa siddhant viksit kiya ki ek prism shwet prakaash ko kai rangon main apaghatit kar detaa he jo drishy spectrum banaate hai
 He gave the rule of cooling and studied the speed of sound

 Isaac Newton was born on 4 January 1643, old style and new style dates | OS]]: 25 December 1642] in Woolsthorpe Manor in woolsthorpe-by-kolsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire
 newton ke janm ke samay, england ne grigorian calendar ko nahin apanaaya tha or isliye unke janm kii tithi ko christmas diwas 25 disambar1642 ke rup main darj kiya gaya
 Newton was born three months after his father's death, he was a prosperous farmer and his name was Isaac Newton
 purv paripakv avasthaa main paidaa hone vaala vah ek chota balak tha; unki mata hanna askf kaa kahana tha ki vah ek chauthai gaylen jaise chote se mag main samaa saktaa tha
 When Newton was three, her mother remarried and moved to live with her new husband, Reverend Barnabus Smith, leaving her son in the care of her grandmother, Margerie Esqf
 The younger Isaac did not like his stepfather
 And had a sense of enmity with his mother for marrying her
 jaisaa ki 19 varsh tak kii aayu main unke dwaara kiye gaye aparaadhon kii suchi main pradarshit hota he: "maine mata or pita smith ke ghar ko jalaane kii dhamkee di
" From the age of twelve to the age of seventeen, he was educated at The King's School, Grantham
 He was expelled from school and in October 1659 he moved to woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth, where his mother, who was widowed for the second time, gave him Insisted on making farmers
 vah kheti se nafrat karte the
 Master Henry Stokes of King's School asked his mother to send him back to school so that he could complete his education
 skool ke ek ladke ke khilaaf badla lene kii ichha se prerit hone kii vajah se ve ek sheersh kram ke chaatr ban gaye
 In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge as a sizar — a kind of work-study role
 us samay college kii shikshaayen arastu par aadhaarit thim
 But Newton wanted to read the ideas of more modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler
 1665 main unhone samanyikrut dwipad prameya kii khoj kii or ek ganitiya siddhant viksit karnaa shuru kiya jo baad main atyalp kalan ke naam se janaa gaya
 As soon as Newton received his degree in August 1665, the university was closed as a precaution to avoid the horrific epidemic of plague
 Although he was not distinguished as a Cambridge student, the following two years He studied privately at his home in Woolsthorpe and developed his theories on calculus, optics and the laws of gravity
 1667 main vah trinity ke ek phelo ke rup main cambridge laut aae
 Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed the least calculus independently using their own unique notations
 newton ke aantarik chakra ke anusaar, newton ne apni is vidhi ko libanij se kai saal pehle hi viksit kar diya tha, lekin unhone lagbhag 1693 tak apane kisi bhi kaary ko prakashit nahin kiya or 1704 tak apane kaary kaa puraa lekha jokha nahin diya
 is bich, libanij ne 1684 main apni vidhiyon kaa puraa lekha jokha prakashit karnaa shuru kar diya
 iske alaava, libanij ke sanketanon tathaa "avkalan kii vidhiyon" ko mahadweep par saarvatrik rup se apanaaya gaya or 1820 ke baad, british samrajya main bhi ise apanaaya gaya
 While Leibniz's pamphlets reflect the modernization of ideas from early stages to maturity, Newton's known notes have only the final result
 newton ne kaha ki ve apane kalan ko prakashit nahin karnaa chaahate the kyonki unhen dar tha ve uphaas kaa paatr ban jaayenge
 Newton had a very close relationship with the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fátio de Duillier, who had been heavily influenced by Newton's theory of gravitation since the beginning
 1691 main duiliar ne newton ke philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica ke ek nae sanskaran ko taiyaar karne kii yojana banaayi, lekin ise kabhi puraa nahin kar paae
baharhaal, in donon purushon ke bich sambandh 1693 main badal gaya
 At this time, Duillier also exchanged several letters with Leibniz
 1699 kii shuruyaat main, royal socity ke anya sadasyon ne libanij par saahitiyik chori ke aarope lagaaye or yah vivaad 1711 main purna rup se saamne aayaa
 a study by the Royal Society of Newton declared that Newton was the true inventor and that Leibniz had committed fraud
 yah adhyayan andeh ke ghere main aa gaya, jab baad paaya gaya ki newton ne khud libanij par adhyayan ke nishkarsh kii tippanee likhi
 Thus began the bitter Newton v
 Leibniz dispute, which continued in the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the death of Leibniz in 1716
 newton ko aam taur par samanyikrut dwipad prameya kaa shrey diya jaataa he, jo kisi bhi ghaat ke liye maanya he
 He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, graded cubic plane curves, made significant contributions to the theory of finite differences, he was the first to use fractional indices and the use of coordinate geometry to derive the solution of diophenatin equations
 did
 unhone laghuganak ke dwaara haraatmak shredhi ke aanshik yoga kaa sanniktan kiya, or ve pehle vyakti the jinhone aatmavishvaas ke saath ghaat shrinkhalaa kaa prayog kiya or ghaat shrinkhalaa kaa vilom kiya
 In 1669 he was elected a Lucasian Professor of Mathematics
 un dinon, cambridge yaa oxford ke kisi bhi sadsy ko ek nirdisht angreji pujari hona aavashyak tha
 However, the Lukesian professor was not required to be active in the church
 newton ne tark diya ki samanvay kii aavashyaktaa se unhen mukt rakhana chahie or charles dwitiya, jisaki anumati anivaary thi, ne is tark ko sweekaar kiya
 Thus a conflict arose between Newton's religious views and the English orthodoxy
 1670 se 1672 tak, newton kaa prakaashiki par vyaakhyaan diya
 is avadhi ke dauraan unhone prakaash ke apvartan kii khoj kii, unhone pradarshit kiya ki ek prism shwet prakaash ko rangon ke ek spectrum main viyojit kar detaa he or ek lens or ek doosraa prism bahuvarni spectrum ko sanyojit kar ke shwet prakaash kaa nirmaan karata he
 He also showed that the separation of colored light and shining on different objects does not change the properties of the colored light
 newton ne varnit kiya ki chaahe yah paravartit ho, yaa vikirit ho yaa sancharit ho, yah samaan rang kaa bana rahata he
 Thus, he observed that color is the result of the interaction of an object with already colored light, rather than the objects themselves producing colors
 yah newton ke rang siddhant ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 From this work he concluded that, the lens of any refractory telescope would experience diffusion in the colors of light, and to prove this concept, he constructed a telescope, using a mirror as an object, so that The problem can be solved
 Indeed, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involves shaping technology and solving the problem of an appropriate mirror material, according to the design of the design
 newton ne atyadhik paravartak veekshak dhaatu ke ek custom sanghathan se, apane darpan ko aadhaar diya, iske liye unke doordarshee hetu prakaashiki ki gunvattta kii jaanch ke liye newton ke chhallon kaa prayog kiya gaya
 By February 1669 he was able to produce an instrument without chromatic aberration
 1671 main royal socity ne unhen unke paravarti doordarshee ko prardashit karne ke liye kaha
 His interest encouraged him to publish his observations on color, which he later elaborated on as his optics
 jab robert hook ne newton ke kuch vichaaron kii aalochana kii, newton itnaa naaraaz hue ki ve saarvajanik bahes se baahar ho gaye
 Both remained enemies until Hook's death
 newton ne tark diya ki prakaash kanon yaa atisuksham kanon se bana he, jo saghan madhyam kii or jate samay apavartit ho jate hai, lekin prakaash ke vivartan ko spasht karne ke liye ise tarangon ke saath sambandhit karnaa jaruri tha
 
 Later physicists supported a pure wave-like explanation for the diffraction of light
 aaj kii kwantem yantriki, photone or tarang-kan yugmata ke vichaar, newton kii prakaash ke bare main samaj ke saath bahut kam samanta rakhte hai
 In his vision of light in 1675, Newton approved the presence of ether to transfer forces between particles
 brahm vidyavadi henry mor ke sampark main aane se rasayan vidya main unki ruchi punerjeevit ho gayi
 They replaced ether with occult forces based on airborne ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles
 John Maynard Keynes, who accepted many of Newton's writings on alchemy, states that "newton was not the first of the era of reason: he was the last of the magicians
 " rasayan vidya main newton kii ruchi unke vigyaan main yogadan se alag nahin kii ja sakati he
 If he had not relied on the secret idea of action at a distance through a vacuum, he would not have developed his theory of gravity
 1704 main newton ne optics ko prakashit kiya, jisamen unhone apane prakaash ke atisookshm kanon ke siddhant kii vistaar se vyakhya kii
unhone prakaash ko bahut hi sookshm kanon se bana hua mana, jabaki saadhaaran dravya bade kanon se bana hota he or unhone kaha ki ek prakaar ke rasinic roopantaran ke madhyam se "sakal nikaay or prakaash ek duusare main roopantarit nahin ho sakate hai, xxrep 7 
 or nikaay, prakaash ke kanon se apni gatividhi ke adhikansh bhaag ko praapt nahin kar sakate, jo unke sanghathan main pravesh karti he?" newton ne ek kaanch ke globe kaa prayog karte hue, ek gharshan vidyut sthitik janarator ke ek aadya rup kaa nirmaan kiya
 In 1677, Newton again began his work on mechanics, that is, with reference to Kepler's laws of gravity and planetary motion, the effect of gravity on the orbit of the planets and Hook and Flemsteed's consultation on the subject
 unhone jiram main di motu corporam main apane parinaamon kaa prakaashan kiya
 It was the introduction of the laws of motion that informed the Principia
 philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica kaa prakaashan edmund heli kii vittiya madad or protsaahan se 5 july 1687 ko hua
 In this work Newton gave three universal laws of motion in which no improvement has been made for more than 200 years
 unhone us prabhaav ke liye latin shabd gravitas kaa istemaal kiya jise gurutv ke naam se janaa jaataa he or saarvatrik gurutvkarshan ke niyam ko paribhaashit kiya
 In this work, he presented the first analytical proof of the speed of sound in air, based on Boyle's law
 bahut adhik duuri par kriya kar sakane vaale ek adrishy bal kii newton kii avadharana kii vajah se unki aalochana hui, kyonki unhone vigyaan main "gupt agenciyon" ko mila diya tha
 With the Principia, Newton gained international fame
 He received much acclaim, being an admirer of his, Switzerland-born Nicolas Fatio de Daulier, with whom he had a deep relationship, which ended in 1693 when Newton suffered from nerve blockages
 1690 ke dashak main, newton ne kai dharmik shodh likhe jo bible kii saahitiyik vyakhya se sambandhit the
 Henry More's belief in the universe and his rejection of Cartesian dualism probably influenced Newton's religious views
 unhone ek pandulipi jon loke ko bheji jisamen unhone trinity ke astitv ko vivaadit mana tha, jise kabhi prakashit nahin kiya gaya
 Subsequent works - The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended and Observations on the Professions of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St
 John - were published after his death
 unhone rasayan vidya ke liye bhi apana bahut adhik samay diya 
 Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England from 1689 to 1690 and in 1701
 But according to some details his comments were always about a cold drought in the vault and he requested to close the window
 1696 main newton shahi taksaal ke warden kaa pad sanbhaalane ke liye landan chale gaye, yah pad unhen rajkosh ke tatkaaleen kuladhipati, helifax ke pehle arl, charles montagu ke sangrakshan ke madhyam se praapt hua
 He took over as the chief currency mover of England, somehow dancing at the behest of Master Lucas
 1699 main lucas kii mrityu newton shaayad taksaal ke sabase prasiddh master bane, is pad par newton apni mrityu tak bane rahe
ye niyuktiyaan daayitvaheen pad ke rup main lee gayin thim, lekin newton ne unhen gambhirtha se liya, 1701 main apane cambridge ke kartavyon se sevanivruth ho gaye or mudra main sudhaar laane kaa prayaas kiya tathaa kataranon tathaa nakli mudra banane waalon ko apni shakti kaa prayog karke sajaa di
 In "la of Queen Anne" as master of the mint in 1717, Newton inadvertently established the pound sterling from the silver standard to the gold standard, establishing a metallic relationship between silver money and gold coins in favor of gold
 Changed
 is kaaran se chaandi sterling sikke ko pighla kar britain se baahar bhej diya gaya
 Newton was made president of the Royal Society in 1703 and an associate of the French Academic des Sciences

 Newton himself was hesitant to state his achievements, writing in a letter to Robert Hooke in February 1676: If i have seen further it is by standing on ye shoulders of Giants Although historians generally believe that the above lines were an attack on Hook, other than - or rather than - a statement made with humility
 At that time there was a dispute between the two about the optical discoveries

 iske liye libanij Condemned him: "almighty God wants to end his watch from time to time: otherwise it will be stopped to move

 Thus, the clarity and ingenuity of science were seen as a way to counter the emotional and spiritual exaggeration of both the threat of atheism and superstitious zeal, and at the same time, a second wave of English divinity led to Newton's discoveries
 Used to demonstrate the possibility of a "natural religion"

 His spokesman, Clarke, disapproved of Leibniz's theology, which freed God from the responsibility of "l'origine du mal", removing God from contributing to his creation, as Clarke said
 Was such a deity would be king by name only, but would be one step away from atheism
 But the undiscovered theological result of the success of Newton's system in the next century would reinforce the position of theism revealed by Leibniz
 duniya ke bare main samaj ab saadhaaran maanav ke kaaran ke str tak aa gayi or maanav, jaisaa ki odo mercward ne tark diya, buraai ke sudhaar or unmoolan ke liye uttaradaayi ban gaya
 On the other hand, the results of the ideas of the Late Latinian and Newtonian were far-reaching, a religious faction devoted to the concept of the mechanical universe, but with the same zeal and mystery that the Enlightenment struggled hard to destroy
 ek pandulipi jo unhone 1704 main likhi, jisame unhone bible se vaigyanik jaankaree nikaalane ke apane prayaas kaa varnan kiya he, unka anumaan tha ki duniya 2060 se pehle samaapt nahin hogi
 In this prophecy, he said, "it does not say what the final time will be, but i want to stop speculation about imaginary individuals who often make predictions about the end times and fail this prediction
" Holy prophecy is discredited upon leaving
 " Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of earlier scientists — Galileo, Boyle, and primarily Newton — as guiding and guaranteeing their application of the single concept of natural law and nature to every physical and social field of election day
 Gone

 raja ke vakil ke rup main newton kaa ek maamla wiliam chaloner ke khilaaf tha
 Chaloner's plan was to set up a fake conspiracy of Catholics and then turn them into hapless conspirators whom he held hostage
 chaloner ne apane aap ko paryaapt samrudh sajjan bana liya
 While applying in Parliament, the Chaloner also provided equipment for making fake coins in the mint
 He proposed that he be allowed to inspect the mint processes so that he could do something to improve it

 Newton tested it for the second time with conclusive evidence

 According to Newton's first law, an object which is in steady state will remain constant and an object which is in the same state of motion will move in the same direction with the same speed until an external force acts on it
 newton ke duusare niyam ke anusaar ek vastu par lagaaya gaya bal f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} \ vec{, samay ke saath iske samveg p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} \ vec{ main parivartan kii dar ke baraabar hota he
 In mathematical terms it can be expressed as follows chunki doosraa niyam ek sthir dravyaman kii vastu par lagu hota he,, pehla pad lupt ho jaataa he or twaran kii paribhaasha kaa upyog karte hue pratisthaapan ke dwaara sameekaran ko sanketon ke rup main nimnanusaar likhaa ja saktaa he The first and second laws represent the breaking of Aristotle's physics, in which it was believed that a force was necessary to maintain motion
 ve rajya main vyavastha kii gati kaa ek uddeshy he rajya badalane ke liye hai ki ek hi shakti kii jarurat he
 The SI unit of force is named Newton in honor of Newton
 newton ke tisare niyam ke anusaar prayek kriya kii baraabar or vipareet pratikriya hoti he
 This means that whenever one object exerts a force on another object then the second object exerts the same force on the first object in the opposite direction
 iskaa ek saamaanya udahaaran he do aais skates ek duusare ke vipareet khiskate hai to vipareet dishaao main khisakane lagate hai
 Another example is the backward thrust of the gun, in which the force exerted by the gun to fire the bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the gun which the gunner feels
 chunki prashn main jo vasteen hai, aisa jaruri nahin ki unka dravyaman baraabar ho, isliye donon vastuon kaa parinami twaran alag ho saktaa he 
 Unlike Aristotle, Newton's physics has become universal
 udhaaharan ke liye, doosraa niyam grahon tathaa ek girte hue pathar par bhi lagu hota he
 The vector nature of the second law establishes a geometric relationship between the direction of force and the type of change in momentum of the object
 newton se pehle, aam taur par yah mana jaataa tha ki surya ke chaaron or ghurnan kar rahe ek grah ke liye ek agragami bal aavashyak hota he jisaki vajah se yah gati karata rahata he
 Newton showed that instead of this, an attraction force inside the Sun is required
 yahan tak ki princepia ke prakaashan ke kai dashakon ke baad bhi, yah vichaar saarvatrik rup se sweekrut nahin kiya gaya
 And many scientists preferred Descartes's theory of Vorticas
 newton aksar khud ek kahani kehete the ki ek ped se ek girte hue seb ko dekh kar ve gurutvkarshan kaa siddhant banane ke liye prerit ho paae
 Later cartoons were made to satirize where the apple was seen falling on Newton's head and it was demonstrated that its influence somehow introduced Newton to the force of gravity
 His booklets showed that in the late 1660s Newton's idea that terrestrial gravity expanded, it was inversely proportional to the square of the moon; However, it took him two decades to develop the complete theory
 jon kanadyuit, jo royal taksaal main newton ke sahyogi the or newton kii bhatiji ke pati bhi the, ne is ghatana kaa varnan kiya jab unhone newton ke jivan ke bare main likhaa: In 1666 he retired from Cambridge again and moved to Lincolnshire near his mother
 jab ve ek baag main gum rahe the tab unhen ek vichaar aayaa ki gurutv kii shakti dharti se ek nishchit duuri tak simit nahin he, lekin yah shakti usase kahin zyada aage vistrut ho sakati he jitna ki pehle aam taur par sochaa jaataa tha
 He told himself whether it would be as high as the moon and if so, it would affect his speed and possibly keep it in its orbit, what was the effect of the logic they were calculating
 
 sawaal gurutv ke astitv kaa nahin tha balki yah tha ki kya yah bal itnaa vistrut he ki yah chaand ko apni kaksha main banaaye rakhane ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Newton showed that if the force decreases in square inverse of distance, the lunar orbital period can be calculated and a good result can be obtained
 unhone anumaan lagaaya ki yahi bal anya kakshiya gati ke liye jimmedaar he or isiilie ise saarvatrik gurutvkarshan kaa naam de diya
 William Stukele, a contemporary writer, recounts the life of Sir Isaac Newton in his memory, recalling a conversation he had with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726, when Newton mentioned that "the idea of gravity in his mind When did it come first? jab vah dhyaan kii mudra main baithe the usee samay ek seb ke girane ke kaaran aisa hua
 Why does this apple always fall perpendicular to the ground? He thought so in himself
 yah bagal main yaa upar kii ore kyon nahin jaataa he, balki hameshaa prithvi ke centre kii ore hi girtaa he
 "in similar terms, Voltaire wrote in an essay on epic poetry," Sir Isaac Newton was wandering in his gardens, looking at an apple falling from a tree, he first thought of the system of gravity
 vibhinn pedo ko "vah" seb ke ped hone kaa daawa kiya jaataa he jiskaa newton ne varnan kiya he
 The King's School, Grantham, claims that the tree was purchased by the school, and after a few years it was brought down with roots and planted in the headmaster's garden
 neshnal trust jo woolsthrope menor kaa maalik he, kaa vartmaan staff is par vivaad karata he, ore daawa karata he ki vah ped unke bageeche main upasthit he jis ke bare main newton ne baat kii
 a descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room in which Newton lived while studying
 brogdel main rashtriya falon kaa sangrah un pedo se grapht kii aapurti kar saktaa he, jo flower of kent ke samaan dikhaai detaa he, jo ek mote goode kii pakaane kii kism he

 Heat or thermal energy is a form of energy that is caused by heat
 urja ke anya roopon kii tarah ooshmaa kaa bhi pravaah hota he
 The energy that is contained in a substance due to it being hot or cold is called its thermal energy
 anya urja kii tarah iskaa maatrak bhi jul hota he par ise calories main bhi vyakt karte hai
 The measurement of hot or cold is called temperature which is measured by a thermometer
 lekin taapmaana keval ooshmaa kii maap he, khud ooshmiya urja nahin
 Numerous systems have been developed to measure this, with Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin being the main ones

 The subdivision of science in which heat is measured is called thermodynamics
 is maapan kaa bahut mahatv he
 Specifically specific heat is theoretically of great importance and many theories are prevalent in relation to it
 ooshmaa kaa sthanantaran teen vidhiyon se hota he chaalan, sanvahan or vikiran
 The first two methods require a fluid medium, but the method of radiation involves the transfer of heat by waves

18 va 107 arg yantric urja ke tulya hoti he ejiniyaron kaa mukhya uddeshy ooshmaa kaa yantric urja main roopaantar karke ingine chalaanaa hota he
 The first law states that both types of energies are indeed integral, but it does not indicate whether one can be changed into the other
 yadi bina roak-tok ooshmaa kaa yantric urja main parivartan sambhav ho saktaa, to ham samudr se ooshmaa lekar jahaaj chalaa sakate
 There is no expenditure of coal and snow also comes together
 anubhav se yah siddh he ki aisa nahin ho saktaa he The second law of thermodynamics says that this is not possible and mechanical energy cannot be obtained from the same heat
 aisa karne ke liye ek nimna tapiya pind kii bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is necessary for any engine to deliver a fraction of the heat received from a high thermal furnace to a lower thermal body
 shesh ansh hi yantric kaary main kaam aa saktaa he
 It is not possible to run a ship with the heat of sea water because there is the same temperature everywhere and no inferior thermal object exists

 To quantify this disorder, a new physical amount called entropy has been conceptualized
 ushmagatiki ke duusare niyam kaa ek pahalu yah bhi he
 That entropy always increases in natural physical actions
 usamen hraas kabhi nahin hota
 According to the third law of thermodynamics, the entropy of a thermodynamic body is zero at zero temperature
 iskaa anya rup yah he ki kisi bhi prayog dwaara shunya param taap kii prapti sambhav nahin
 Yes, we can reach very close to it, but not to it
 ooshmaagatiki ke prayog kaa kshetra bahut vistrut he
 The thermodynamic study of radiation has led to a new and revolutionary ideology of quantum theory

 Politics gateway 1956 kaa samvidhan pakistan main march 1956 se oktober 1958 tak lagu pakistan kii sarvocch vidhi samhita va samvidhan thi, jise 1958 ke takhtapalat ko baad nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 This was the first constitution of Pakistan
 1950 main bharat main samvidhan ke parvartan ke baad, pakistan ke saansadon ne apane samvidhan ko gathit karne ke prayaas tej kar die
 Prime Minister Mohammad Ali and his government officials worked with the support of opposition parties in the country to prepare a constitution for Pakistan
 ant main, is sanyukt kaary ke kaaran, samvidhan ke pehle samoocchy ko lagu kiya gaya
 The incident took place on 23 March 1956, to this day still celebrates Republic Day on the occasion of the enforcement of the Constitution of Pakistan
 is samvidhan ne pakistan ko "ekasadaneey vidhayika" ke saath sarkaar kii sansadeey pranali pradaan kii
 Also, it officially declared Pakistan an Islamic republic
 iske alaava, isamen, samta ke siddhant ko bhi pehali baar pesh kiya gaya tha
 Its main features were: samvidhan dwaara, iskundar mirza ne adhyaksh pad grahan kiya, lekin rashtriya maamalon main unki lagaataar asanvaidhanik bhagidaari ke kaaran, chaar nirvaachit pradhanmantriyon ko maatr do saalon main hi barkhaast kar diya gaya
 Under public pressure, President Iskandar Mirza upheld the coup in 1958; And thus this constitution was almost suspended
 sheeghra hi baad main general ayub khan ne iskundar mirza apdasth or khud ko raashtrapati ghoshit kar diya
 And so this constitution was able to run only for 3 years

 Template: Infobox Laboratory equipment aatoklav ek aisa saadhan he, jo upkarnon or samagriyon ko unke bhaar or antarvastu ke aadhaar par, visheshtah 15 se 20 minute tak, 121 °C yaa adhik ke ucch dabaav vaale vaashp ke adheen rakh kar, unhen nishkitit karata he
 It was invented in 1879 by Charles Chamberland, while its pioneer named Steam Digester was built in 1679 by Dennis Papin
 iske naam kii utpatti francisi shabd aut or latin shabd clavis arthath kunjee se hui he jiskaa arth he - ek swa-avarodhi upkaran
 There are two main types of autoclaves: aatoklav kaa istemaal vyapak rup se sookshm jeev-vigyaan, chikitsa, godana, sharir chhedan, pashu vigyaan, kavak vigyaan, danta chikitsa, padchikitsa or kritrim nirmaan main hota he
 Typical loads include glassware, medical waste, utensils, animal cage bedding, and lysogeny growth
 upachaar or apshisht ke visankraman jaise vyaadhijanak aspataal apshisht main aatoklav ek ullekhneey rup se badhata anuprayog he
 Machines in this category operate largely on the principles of real autoclaves, in which they are able to neutralize potentially infectious agents by the use of pressurized vapor and superheated water
 apshisht parivartakon kii ek nai peedi bina kisi dabaav paatr ke vahi prabhaav praapt karne main sakasham hai, jinase ve culture media, rabar saamagree, goun, dressing dastaane aadi ko nishkitit karti he
 This is especially useful for items that cannot tolerate the high temperature of hot air oven
 For all glass syringes, hot air oven is a better sterilization method
 yah sunishchit karnaa adhik mahatvapurn he ki fansi hui hawa puri tarah nikaal di gai he, kyonki garm hawa nishkiton hasil karne main bahut kamazor hoti he
 It takes two hours for hot air at 160 ° c to achieve a sterile condition, vapor at 134 ° c in 3 minutes
 hawa kii nishkasana vidhiyon main shaamil hai: Lower displacement - Since steam is less dense than air, vapor enters the upper regions as it enters the chamber
 yah hawa ko neeche kii ore dabaakar use nikaas se baahar nikaal detii he
 Often a temperature sensing device is placed in the exhaust
 jab hawa kii nikasi puri tarah sampann ho jaati he, keval tab pravaah rukta he
 The flow is usually controlled by the use of a solenoid valve or steam trap, but sometimes bleed holes are often used, including a combination of solenoid valves
 jab hawa or bhaap mishrit hote hai tab us mishran ko neeche ke alaava kaksh ke anya sthanon se bhi nikaalnaa sambhav hota he
 Vapor Puls - Air dilution is carried out using a series of vapor pulses, in which the chamber is alternately pressurized and de-pressurized to reach atmospheric pressure
 nirvaat pump - hawa yaa hawa / bhaap mishran ko khinch kar nikaalane ke liye nirvaat pump
 Super-atmospheric - This type of cycle uses vacuum pumps
 yah nirvaat ke saath shuru hota he, baad main vaashp spand or uske baad nirvaat, jiskaa anuvartan vaashp spand karata he
 The number of pulses depends on the specific autoclave and the selected cycle
 sab-vayumandaleey yah super-vayumandaleey chakra ke samaan hi hota he, lekin kaksh kaa dabaav kabhi bhi vayumandaleey dabaav se adhik nahin badhata he jab tak ki ve nishkiton taapmaana tak daabaanukoolit nahin karte
 a medical autoclave is a device that uses vapor to sterilize equipment and other objects
 taatpary yah ki sabhi bacteria, virus, kavak or bijaanu niskriy ho jate hai
 However, preons such as germs associated with creutzfeldt-jakob disease may not be destroyed by autoclaving, specifically at 134 ° c for 3 minutes or 121 ° c for 15 minutes
 iske alaava, kuch haal hi main khoje gaye strain 121 jaise jeev, 121 °C se bhi adhik taapmaana par jivit rah sakate hai
 Autoclaves are found in many medical settings and in other places, which need to ensure sterility of the objects
 aajkal kii kai prakriyaayein nishkitit, punarupayogi vastuon ke sthaan par ekal-upyog vastuon kaa hi istemaal karti hai
 This first happened with hypodermic needles, but today many surgical instruments are generally single useful items rather than reusable
 apshisht aatoklav dekhen
 Because moist heat is used, some heat-changing objects cannot be sterilized in this way, otherwise they will melt
 Some paper or other products, which may be destroyed by vapor, are also sterilized by other means
 sabhi aatoklaivon main, vastuon ko hameshaa alag karke rakhaa janaa chahie, taaki bhaap ladi hui madon ke bheetar samaan rup se pravesh kar saken
 Autoclave systems are often used to sterilize medical waste prior to mixing into municipal standard solid waste streams

 Incineration or similar thermal oxidation processes are still generally mandatory for pathogenic wastes and other very toxic and / or infectious medical wastes
 aatoklav main bhautik, rasinic or jaivik sanketak maujuud hote hai jinka upyog yah sunishchit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he ki aatoklav sahi samay par, sahi taapmaana tak pahunchaa he yaa nahin
 Chemical indicators can be seen in medical packaging and autoclave tapes and change color once the correct conditions are reached
 yah rang parivartan is baat kaa sanket detaa he ki package ke andar yaa tepe ke neeche kii vastu sansaadhit ho chuki he
 Biological indicators include the heat-resistant bacterium, Geobacillus stereothermophilus
 yadi aatoklav sahi taapmaana tak nahin pahunchataa he, tab udbhavan par jeevanu badhane lagate hai or unka chayapachay ph-samvedansheel rasayan kaa rang parivartit kar detaa he
 Some physical indicators consist of an alloy designed to melt when it passes the associated holding time
 yadi mishra dhaatu pighalta he, to parivartan dikhaai degaa
 Some computer-controlled autoclaves use F0 values to control the sterilization cycle
 F0 mulyon ko 15 minute ke liye vayumandaleey dabaav se upar samakaksh nishkiton ke minuton tak 121 °se
 par 15 pound prati varg inch set kiya jaataa he
 Since precise temperature control is difficult, the temperature is monitored and the sterilization time is adjusted accordingly

 Currently, ship dismantling is being done mainly in India, China, Pakistan and Bangladesh
 kuch hi apwaadon ko chhodkar adhikansh poton kaa vikhandan samudr kinare sthit ikaayiyon main hota he
 Current methods of ship dismantling do not meet the requirements of compliance in many respects, compared to the common standards and conventions prevailing in industrialized countries
 in paddatiyon kii kuch kamiyon main shaamil hai paryaapt ehtiyaati kadam na uthaanaa, aparyaapt prashikshan or jaagrukta or ye sab vikhandan ikaayiyon par lagu hoti hai
 Apart from these, there are many drawbacks
 sudhaar karne ke upaay lagu karne kaa prabhaav maatr jalpot vikhandan ikai par hi nahin padegaa, balki vikhandan ke purv kii gatividhiyon par or vikhandan ke dauraan praapt kiye gaye apshisht padaarthon ke antim gantavy sthaan or unke niptaare par bhi padegaa
 The problems that arise from the shortcomings of current ship dismantling methods have consequences not only to the environment, but also to the occupational safety and health of the workers
 paryaavarniya prabhaavon ko is tarah vargeekruti kiya ja saktaa he:vikhandan ke liye aavashyak sthaan ko gherkar or use vistaar dete jaakar, vikhandan udyog sthaneey parivesh, paryaavaran or samaaj ko prabhavit karata he

 The Technical Working Group of the Basel Pact was asked to initiate the development of technical guiding principles for the environmentally appropriate management of complete and partial dismantling of ships
 iske saath hi, takneekee kaary dal ko jalpot vikhandan ke liye praasangik besel sandhi ke adheen aanevaale khatarnaak apshishton or padaarthon kii suchi banane ko kaha gaya
 This document, a technical guiding principle for the environmentally appropriate management of complete and partial fragmentation of ships, was designed to provide guidance to countries that wish to establish ship dismantling facilities
 ye maardarshak siddhant un karypranaliyon, prakriyaaon or kaarividhiyon ke bare main jaankaree evam siforishein dete hai, jo paryaavarniya drushti se uchit prabandhan hetu lagu kii jaani hai
 These guidelines also advise for monitoring and verification of environmental performance
 besel sandhi ke sandarbh main iesaim ko is tarah paribhaashit kiya gaya he: According to Section 2, paragraph 8, "environmentally appropriate management of hazardous wastes and other materials" means "managing hazardous wastes and other substances in such a manner as to cause human health and the environment to cause these wastes Protect against any adverse effects "
 moolbhoot ehtiyaati kadam na uthaane se karmiyon kii suraksha daanv par lag jaati he
 Due to lack of proper guiding principles for decommissioning ships, it is not possible to make necessary preparations on ships before they are sent for fragmentation and therefore ships themselves are also pit-prone
 jokhik kam karne yaa unhen purnatah dur karne ke moolbhoot kadam bhi nahin uthaae jate or isse antat durghatnaayen hokar rahati hai
 Lack of mutual adjustment in working systems, lack of facilities and lack of security controls are all different parts of the risk
 swasthya sambandhi sabase pramukh chintaa kaa vishay he hanikaarak padaarthon ke sampark main aana, swatchta kii aparyaapt suvidhaayen or kaary prachaalan kaa swaroop hi 
 General exposure to pollutants emitted from ship dismantling units can put the health of people living around these units at risk
 jalpot vikhandan karmi or sthaneey samudaay ke log pisibi, pieech, baari dhaatuen or esbestose jaise cancer laanevaale padaarthon or anya hanikaarak padaarthon ke sampark main aa sakate hai
 The harmful consequences caused by these substances are well known
 ye prabhaav kaaphi gambhir ho sakate hai or ye agali pidiyon ko sthanantarit ho sakate hai
 These guidelines do not at this time throw light on the measures to remove the hazardous substances as far as possible before sending them to the recycling unit
 lekin, besel sandhi ke pakshon kaa yah maananaa he ki jalpoton ke punashchakran se judi samasyaon ke samaadhaan hetu is tarah apshisht padaarthon ko kam karne ke liye maardarshak siddhant gadhana bahut hi aavashyak he

 The topics taken here are only related to technical and functional aspects of ship dismantling
 yah maan liya gaya he ki khatarnaak apshisht ke rup main jalpoton ke niryaat se jude kanoonee prashnon kaa besel sandhi ke kanoonee kaary dal dwaara nirikshan abhi baaki he

 paradeon ko ganatantr diwas jaise utsavon par, sankatagrast kshetron main janata ko aashwasit karne ke liye, yudhsthiti main adhikrut kshetra main shatru kaa manobal todane ke liye or anya sthitiyon main yojit kiya jaataa he
 The hand is a pair of human and other human-like quadrupedal vertebrate animal pairs, with many fingers at the ends
 saanchaa:human anatomical featuressazca:upper limb general a computer file is a class of information collected, or a resource for storing information that is available to a computer program, and is usually based on some kind of durable computer storage
 sanchika tikaoo is lihaaz se hoti he ki yah maujuuda kaarykram ke samaapt hone ke baad bhi anya kaaryakramon dwaara istemaal ke liye maujuud rahati he
 Computer files can traditionally be considered the modern form of paper documents contained in files from offices and libraries, which is why the file is named in English
 nunatam str par kai aadhunik prachaalan pranaliyaan sanchikaon ko keval ek-aiami biton kii shrunkhlaa hi maanati hai
 At a more high level, when the contents of the file are also kept in view, these binomial digits may be considered representing integers, letters, image pixels, sounds, or anything else
 yah sanchika kaa istemaal karne vaale kaarykram par nirbhar he ki vah kis prakaar sanchika kaa arth nikaalata he or jaankaree ke aantarik jamaav ko kaise samajhataa he, taaki prayokta ko or adhik myne rakhane vaali style main isi jaankaree ko prastut kar sake 
 At any given time, the file will have a shape, usually expressed in bytes, and indicate how much space the file has in store
 adhiktar aadhunik prachaalan pranaaliyon main yah aakaar koi bhi arunatmak purnank ho saktaa he, lekin pranali ke anusaar isaki adhiktam seemaa hogi
 But the simple definition of a file does not preclude that its current size has any real meaning, except in the case when the contents of the file are some of the contents within a set of persistent collections
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi unics-samaan pranali main jis sanchika kii ore / bin / ls kii kadi ingit karti he, uskaa aakaar paribhaashit hota he or virale hi badalata he
 Compare this to / dev / null, it is also a file but its size always changes but probably does not matter the same way as in the previous example
 kisi sanganak sanchika main maujuud jaankaree or choti jaankariyon ke pulindon ke rup main ho sakati he yaa chalneey bhi ho sakati he
 It only depends on the creator of the file how the information will be organized in it
 is kaaran se anekon kam maanak vaali sanchika dhaanche maujuud hai jo saralatam se jatiltam tak har prakaar ke makasad ke liye kaam aa sakate hai
 Most computer files are used by computer programs
 ye kaarykram apane istemaal ke liye yathochit sanchikaaye banaate, badalte va mitaate hai
 The program-makers who make these programs decide which files are needed, how they are to be used and their names
 kuch maamalon main sanganak kaarykram sanchikaon main her fer is dhang se karte hai ki ve sanganak prayokta ko dikhti hai
 For example, in the word-processing program, users make changes to document files and the user names them by themselves
 dastauez sanchika kii saamagree is tarah yojit hoti he ki shabd-sansaadhan kaarykram ko vah samaj main aa jaae, lekin prayokta hi uskaa naam va bhandaaran pataa nirdhaarit karata he or bhandaaran kii pramukh jaankaree bhi prayokta hi nirdhaarit karata he
 Many applications push all the content files into a single file and mark them inside to keep track of different types of information
 duum or quek jaise khelon kii saamagree sanchikaaye iskaa ek udhaaharan hai
 On the computer, it is possible to create, modify, extend, shrink, move, and delete files
 adhiktar maamalon main, sanganak kaaryakramon ko sanganak par chalaa kar yah sab kiya jaataa he, par zarurat ho to sanganak kaa prayokta bhi sanchikaon main badlaav kar saktaa he
 For example, Microsoft Word files are usually created by the Microsoft Word program based on user instructions, but the user can also delete, delete, or transfer these files directly through a file manager program such as Windows Explorer
 unics-jaisi pranaaliyon main prayokta-kshetra kii prakriyaayein aamtaur par sidhe sanchikaon se nahin ulajhati hai; prachaalan pranali ek pruthakkaran str pradaan karti he jisaki vajah se prayokta-kshetra kii ore se sanchikaon ke saath kaa lagbhag sara len-dein kathor kadiyon se hota he
 a file can be named by using rigid links; Purely operating systems do not have names of files
 udhaaharan ke liye prayokta-kshetra ke kaarykram kisi sanchika ko mitaa nahin sakate hai, ve keval us sanchika kii kadi ko mitaa sakate hai or yadi ashthi ko yah pataa lagata he ki is sanchika kii ab koi or kadiyaan nahin hai, to vah is sanchika ko mitaa saktaa he
 In fact, only the layer transacts through files, but user-zone requests are done through files in such a way that it remains unknown to user-zone programs
 yun to kaaryakramon kaa sanchikaon ke saath kaa len-dein prachaalan pranali or sanchika pranali ke hisaab se alag alag hota he par mukhyatah yah gatividhiyaan aam hai: In modern computer systems, filenames are commonly used to access files
 kuch prachaalan pranaaliyon main yah naam sanchika se judaa hota he
 In some others, the file itself is anonymous, but named links point to it
 is maamle main prayokta kadi ko hi sanchika kaa naam samaj saktaa he, lekin yah vastav main sahi nahin hoga, khaastaur par jab ek hi sanchika kii ek se adhik kadiyaan hon tab
 The files can be in directories
 lekin behatar yah kahana hoga ki nirdeshika ke andar sanchikaon kii suchi yaa sanchikaon kii kadiyon kii suchi ho sakati he
 Under this definition it is very important to understand that the term "file" also includes directories
 isse nirdeshikaon ke sopan sambhav hote hai, arthath nirdeshikaon ke andar upanirdeshikas
 The name that refers to a file inside a directory must be unique
 lekin kuch prachaalan pranaaliyon main naam ke saath prakaar bhi nirdisht hota he jisaki vajah se ek nirdeshika main do alag alag prakaar kii sanchikaayen ek hi naam se sambhav hai jaise ki ek hi naam kii ek nirdeshika va ek sanchika
 In environments in which files are named, the pair of file names and paths must be unique - the names and paths of any two files cannot match the names and paths of any other file
 jahaan sanchika benaam ho, namit sandarbh ek namasthaan ke antargat rahenge
 Most times a name in any namespace will refer to exactly one or zero files
 lekin, koi bhi sanchika kisi namasthaan main shunya, ek yaa adhik naamon se sanderbhit kii ja sakati he
 Depending on the context of the application, the appropriate name for any file or link must be made up of special characters
 sanganak pranali par nirbhar karata he ki yah naam upyukt he yaa nahin
 Early computers allowed a limited number of letters and numbers in a file's name, but modern computers allow long names to contain Unicode characters or Unicode numbers in almost any order, so that the purpose of the file is understood at a glance
 
 kuch sanganak pranaliyaan sanchika naamon main khaali sthaan kii anumati dete hai, kuch nahin
 The ephemeral sensitivity of file names is determined by the file system
 unics sanchika pranaliyaan aamtaur par laghudirghasanvedi hoti hai or prayokta-stareey anuprayogon ko aisi sanchikaaye banane detii hai jinke aksharon main keval laghu or deergh kaa fark ho
 Microsoft Windows offers several file systems, with different policies for short-term sensitivity
 yadi prayokta nirdeshika pravishtion main sanchika naamon ko badalane ke liye discs sampadak kaa istemaal kare to prachlit effeti pranali main kai sanchikaaye ho sakati hai jinke naam main keval deergh-laghu aksharon kaa hi fark ho
 However, user applications generally do not allow this
 adhiktar sanganak, sanchikaon ko sopan ke aadhaar par yojit karte hai or iske liye folder, nirdeshika yaa kaitlog kaa istemaal karte hai
 Whatever the word, the idea is the same
 har folder main kuch sankhya main sanchikaaye ho sakati hai or unamem anya folder ho sakate hai
 These other folders are called subfolders
 inamen or sanchikaaye va folder ho sakate hai, aadi-aadi, aise kar ke ek vriksh-rupi dhaanchaa nirmit hota he jisamen ek "guru folder" yaa hota he jiske adheen kitne bhi str tak sanchikaaye va folder ho sakate hai
 Folders can also have names like files
 folderon ke jariye sanchikaon ko taarkik tareeke se yojit karnaa saral ho jaataa he
 Whenever a computer uses folders, each file and folder has not only its own name but also a path that indicates which folder or folders the file or folder is present in
 is path main ek vishesh chihn - jaise ki / - ko jariye sanchika yaa folder naamon ke bich main likhaa jaataa he
 For example in the example in this article, / Payroll / Salaries / Managers indicates that a file named Managers is in a folder called Salaries, and this folder is in Payroll
 sanchika or folder ke naamon ke bich main aage jhuki lakeer he, sarvocch yaa jad folder kaa koi naam nahin he, atah naam aage jhuki lakeer se shuru hota he 
 Many computer systems use extensions in file names, also called file types
 windos sanganakon main vistaar sanchika ke naam ke baad ek bindu or bindu ke aage kuch akshar kaa rup letaa he, ye akshar sanchika ke prakaar kii pahchaan hote hai
 The 
txt extension is the identity of the text file, the 
doc extension is the identity of a document, especially in Microsoft Word file format; Etc
 etc
 sanganak pranali par vistaaron kaa istemaal hone par bhi, sanganak pranali unhen kis had tak pahachaanata he or kis had tak unke anusaar vyavhaar karata he, isamen bhi kaafii vividhta he, kuch pranaaliyon main ye anivaary hai, jabaki kuch or main inke maujuud hone se bhi koi fark nahin padataa, ye nazarandaz kar die jate hai
 Many modern computer systems provide ways to prevent files from getting damaged
 jo sanganak ek se adhik prayoktaaon kii suvidha dete hai ve sanchika anumatiyaan bhi lagu karte hai jinase yah niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he ki koun sanchikaaye va folder bana, mitaa yaa badal saktaa he or koun nahin
 For example, a user may have permission to change a file but not delete it, or to create files and folders but not delete it
 anumatiyon ke jariye yah bhi nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he ki keval kuch hi prayokta kisi sanchika yaa folder kii saamagree dekh saken
 Permissions protect against illegal alteration or destruction of content in files and illegal users can be prevented from viewing certain files to keep private information confidential
 kai sanganakon main ek or bachaav vidhi maujuud hoti he jise "keval pathneey chihn" kehete hai
 When this sign is placed, files can be inspected but cannot be changed
 yah chihn vikat jaankaree ke liye laabhadaayak hota he jise badla yaa mitaayaa nahin janaa chahie, jaise ki sanganak pranali ke aantarik purzon dwaara prayukt kuch vishesh sanchikaon ke liye
 Some systems also include a "hidden sign", which ensures that the file becomes invisible
 is chihn ke jariye sanganak pranali aisi zaruri pranali sanchikaon ko chhipaati he, jinhen prayoktaaon dwaara badla nahin janaa chahie
 In the above discussion, the file is described as a concept for a high level operating system or user
 lekin, kisi bhi sanchika ko vastav main kaam laayak hone ke liye bhautik rup se upasthit hona aavashyak he
 That is, the abstract concept of a file needs to be in the actual physical form in the real computer system, otherwise it does not have to exist
 bhautik rup se adhiktar sanganak sanchikaaye kisi prakaar ke saamagree bhandaaran upkaran main rakhi jaati hai
 Examples are hard jisc, through which most operating systems operate
 adhiktar sanchikaaye inhen main rakhi jaati hai
 Hard disks are the most widely available non-volatile storage device in the early 21st century
 yadi sanchikaon main keval asthaayee saamagree hi ho to unhen areem main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 In operating systems like Unix, many files are not directly connected to any physical storage device: / dev / null is a prime example of this, likewise almost all of the files contained within / dev, / proc and / sys are of the same type
 
 inkaa prayokta kshetra main sanchikaon kii tarah prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 But these are virtual files that actually exist only as objects of the operating system's archetype
 sanganak sanchikaon ko chumbakeey pattayon main bhandaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 In some cases files can also be stored in other media such as writeable compact discs, digital multivariate disks, zip drives, USB flash drives, etc
 jab sanganak sanchikaon main bahut mahatvapurn jaankaree hote he to pratilipi prakriya ke jariye aisi sthitiyon ko parinaamon se bachane kii koshish kii jaati he jinamein sanchikaaye nasht ho sakati hai
 Copying files simply means keeping the copies of the files in another location so that if something happens to the original computer or they are accidentally erased, they can be returned by copy
 sanchikaon kii prati rakhane ke kai tareeke hai
 Most computer systems provide convenience programs that facilitate the copying process, as it can take a lot of time if many files are to be copied
 sanchikaon ko aksar lekhanyogy sidi yaa cartrij tepon jaise hastantaraneey madhyamon main pratilipit kiya jaataa he
 Copying files to another hard disk of the same computer protects against a malfunction of one disk, but if the entire computer is to be protected against the risk of malfunction or loss, it is necessary to make copies of those files in such medium Which can be taken away from this computer and stored in a safe place
 dada-baap-betaa pratilipi vidhi swachaalit rup se teen pratilipiyaan banaati he, sanchika kii sabase puraani prati dada sanchika hoti he or betaa maujuuda pratilipi
 The system of which files are organized, named, stored and changed by which computer is called its file system
 adhiktar prachaalan pranaaliyon main kam se kam ek sanchika pranali hoti he
 Multiple file systems can be run simultaneously in many operating systems
 udhaaharan ke liye, nae emes windos sanganakon par emes-dos ke puraane effeti-style kii sanchika pranaliyaan samarthit hai or saath hi taaze windos sanskarnon kii prachlit sanchika pranali antiatioes bhi chalati he
 Every system has its advantages and disadvantages
 udhaaharan ke liye maanak effeti main keval 8 akshar ke sanchika naam chalate hai, jabaki antiatioes main lambey sanchika naam sambhav hai jinamein khaali sthaan bhi ho sakate hai
 You can name a file in NTFS like Payroll records but in FAT this name can be something similar to payroll
dat
 sanchika prabandhak kaarykram suvidhadaayak kaarykram hote hai jinke jariye sanchikaon va folderon ko hilaayaa, banaaya, mitaayaa yaa punarnamit kiya ja saktaa he, par ye vastav main aapako sanchika kii saamagree ko padhane yaa saamagree jodne nahin dete hai
 Each computer system provides at least one file manager for its parent file system
 windos main sabase adhik prayukt sanchika prabandhak kaarykram windos explorer he or mike main yah finder he
 Linux has many file managers like Nautilus, Conqueror
 sanchika ke liye prayukt angrezi shabd "fil" kaa sanganak bhandaaran ke sandarbh main prayog 1952 se hi chhidi pattiyon main sanchit jaankaree ke liye shuru ho gaya tha
 In the initial experiment, people used to call the underlying software only file
 udhaaharan ke liye ibiem 350 kii discs drivon ko "discs fil" kaha jaataa tha
 Systems such as the 1962 compatible time sharing system had file systems that displayed multiple "files" on a single cache device, and thus began the modern use of the term
 sitis ke sanchika naamon main do hisse the, ek prayokta-pathneey "pradhan naam" or doosraa "apradhan naam" jo sanchika kaa prakaar bataata tha
 This practice is still practiced by many operating systems, including Microsoft Windows
 yun to aajkal prayukt "register sanchika" sanchikaon kii praarambhik pariklpana darshaati he, kintu yah praayah lupt ho chuki he

 Amar Singh Rathore was a famous Rajput of the Marwar state
 wo 17veen sadi main bharat ke mogul samraat shah jahaan ke rajdrabari the
 After being deported by his family, he came to the service of the Mughals
 unki prasiddh bahaduree or yuddh kshamta ke parinamswaroop unhen samraat dwaara shahi sammaan or vyaktigat pahchaan mili
 After which he was made the Subedar of Nagaur and later he ruled here
 san 1644 main unki anadhikrut anupasthiti main samraat dwaara karadhaan se naaraaz huye or kar lene ke liye jimmedaar salaabat khan kaa talwaar se galaa kaat diya
 His description is well-known in Rajasthan, western Uttar Pradesh and some folk songs of Punjab
 raja gaj singh mughal shaasha shahjahan ke adheen marwar kshetra ke shaasha the
 His son Amar Singh Rathore was a great warrior and a patriot, but his father had deported him from the kingdom for saving a bandit from the Mughals
 baad main vah shahjahan kii dilli sultanate main shaamil ho gaye jaha unhone shahjahan ko apni veerta se prabhavit kiya
 Which made him the vassal of Nagaur
 haalanki samraat ke bhai salaabat khan, rajya main amar singh rathod ke utthan se jalte the or amar singh ko badnaam karne kaa avasar kii pratiksha kar rahe the
 He soon gets this chance when a few small things come to know about Amar Singh's unauthorized absence
 salaabat khan ne ek mudda ke rup main ise itnaa badha diya ki shahjahan ne salaabat se amar singh ko dand dene kaa aadesh diya
 Taking advantage of this, Salabat threatens Amar Singh and asks him to pay the penalty at the same time
 salaabat ne yah bhi chetavanee di ki vah amar singh ko bina dand kaa bhugtan kiye unhen jane nahin denge
 Amar Singh took out his sword and killed Salabat on the spot
 samraat shahjahan bhi is ghatana se achambhit ho gaye or amar singh ko maarane ke liye apane sainikon kaa aadesh diya
 However, the brave Amar showed his fighting prowess and killed all those who attacked him
 vah jaldi se kile se bhaag gaye or surakshit sthaan par laut gaye
 In the court the next day, the emperor announced that the man who killed Amar Singh would be made a jagirdar, although no one was ready to strike hostility with Amar Singh Rathore, as he had to face Amar Singh's wrath just a day before
 Was
 arjunasingh jo amar singh ke saale the, ne laalach main aakar is chunauti ko sweekaar kar liya
 Arjun Singh told Amarsingh that Shah Jahan realized his mistake and did not want to lose a warrior like Amar Singh
 haalanki amar singh ko shuruyaat main vishwaas nahin tha, parantu jald hi ve arjunasingh ke vishwasghaat kii kala ke jhaanse main aa gaye
 Meanwhile, a small door was erected in front of Shah Jahan's court, so that Amar Singh would have to bow before him to enter the court
 pehle amar ke krityon ko or adaalat main kaarywahi dekhakar, ek utsuk fakir ne samraat se poocha, "ham itane saare yoddhaon vaale hindustan ko kaise jeet sakate hai" shahjahan ne kaha, "ruko or dekhen ki ham kaise karenge "
 Amar was not ready to bow to the emperor and Arjun Singh realized this
 usne amar singh ko pehle pravesh karne kaha
 Amar obeyed his advice, Arjun Singh came from the other side and stabbed a dagger in Amar Singh's chest, Amar Singh got Virgati on him
 to arjunasingh ne unka sar kaata or samraat ke paas le gaya
 The king pointed to the fakir and said "now you know how we got rid of the warriors"
 baad main shahjahan ne arjunasingh ko bhi maar diya
 On notice of Amar Singh's death, Rajput soldiers led by his wife, Bhallu Singh and Ram Singh, attacked the fort where Amar Singh's body lay
 haalanki, hajaaron mughal sainikon ne rajput balon ko gher liya
 Bahadur Rajput forces resisted him until Amar Singh's body was taken away from the fort
 yadhyapi un sabhi rajput ladaakon ne apana jivan mrityu ko samarpit kar diya, lekin ve kabhi bhi mughal sultanate ke saamne jhuke nahin
 Later, the narrow gate in the fort became popularly known as Amar Singh Darwaza as it was a symbol of Rajput bravery over the Muslim army
 kuch itihaaskaaron kaa daawa he ki shahjahan ne sthaayee rup se darwaja band karne kaa aadesh diya kyonki yah unhen rajput balon ke haathon se unki haar kii yaad dilaataa tha
 Folklore developed a heartfelt singing style in praise of those Rajput fighters who fought for pride and died with pride
