 pracheen lekhan saamagree or lekhan-vidhiyon kaa gyaan
 The beginning of epigraphy in India began with the study of Ashoka's writings
 ashok ke anek lekh chattaanon, stambhon aadi par likhe hue praapt hue hai
 But for a long time those articles could not be studied because those articles are written in Brahmi script and there was no one in the current knowledge of Brahmi script
 aaj ke bharat kii sari lipiyaan brahami se vyutpann hone par bhi hamaare desh ke pandit sadiyon pehle pracheen brahmi ko bhul chuke the
 Sultan Firoz Shah Tughlaq of Delhi, 1356 AD In the Ashoka-pillar of Topra and Meerut were ordered to be erected in Delhi
 in stambhon par utkeern lekhon ko padhane ke liye firoj tughlak ne panditon ko aamantrit kiya tha, kintu us samay ek bhi aisa pandit nahin mila jo ashok ke in brahami lekhon ko pard sake
 Akbar was also keen to know what is written on these columns, but even at that time no such pundit could be found who could read these articles
 isse spasht hota he ki puraani brahami lipi kaa gyaan bharat main islamic rajya kii sthapana ke pehle hi lupt ho gaya tha
 In the second half of the eighteenth century, when the British set their feet in India, they also paid some attention to the study of the ancient culture of India
 sar wiliam jones ke prayaas se “asia ke itihaas, aadi ke anushilan ke liye” 1784i
 main kalakata main aciatic sosayadi kii sthapana hui
 Since then, many scholars from Europe started pursuing Indian archeology and the work of searching and studying the archives also began
 wiliam jones ke baad charles wilkins pehle videshi vidwaan hai jinhone sanskrit kaa gahan adhyayan kiya tha
 Wilkins succeeded in reading some of the writings around the tenth century and also recognized about half the alphabet of the Gupta period writings
 lekin ashok ke abhilekh kareeb chah sau saal adhik puraane hai, isliye unhaken aasaani se pard paanaa sambhav nahin tha
 Initially, Europeans were imagined that the language of Ashoka's writings is Sanskrit
 isliye bhi ashok kii brahami lipi kaa udghaatan hone main kuch deree hui
 Finally James Prinsep inaugurates the Brahmi script alphabet
 princep kalakatta kii taksaal ke adhikari the or aciatic sosayadi ke secretary bhi
 He also assisted in reading the alphabet of the Gupta script
 ab ve adhik puraane lekhon ko padhane main jute gaye
 He asked for raids on inscriptions of many places and mixed them up and studied them
 ant main 1837i
 main unhone sanchi ke kuch daanalekhon main 'daanan' shabd ke aksharon ko pahachaanaa or phir unhone sheeghra hi brahami ke shesh aksharon ko bhi pahchaan liya
 Thus James Prinsep inaugurated almost the entire alphabet of the Brahmi script
 is mahaan khoj ke baad bhartiya itihaas va samskruti ke adhyayan kaa ek nayaa adhyay aarambh hua
 After Prinsep, many scholars from India and abroad started studying the archives
 tab se hi bharat ke logon ko apane desh kii pracheen samskruti ke bare main yatharth jaankaree milane lagi
 Today we can read Ashoka's Brahmi script and all the articles written in scripts developed from this script
 shilalekhon ke adhyayan se purv bharat kaa pracheen itihaas andhkaarmay tha
 Whatever information about history was available only from literary sources, but that information was so small and conflicting that it was difficult to know the real facts of history, but the study of inscriptions led to the knowledge of new historical facts

 This type of tourism includes travel to "black" sites such as battle lands, horrific scenes or places of acts of crimes with acts of genocide, for example, concentration camps
 Black tourism is a serious threat to morality: should such sites be available for viewing, if so what should be the trend of the way of publicity
 Black tourism is a small niche market operated by various purposes, such as mourning, remembrance

 In music, harmony is the simultaneous use of pitches or chords
 swar sangati ke adhyayan main cord evam unki rachana tathaa cord kaa anukram or unako niyantrit karne vaale sangyojan ke siddhant shaamil hai
 Vocal consistency is considered superior to the melodic line, or horizontal aspect, and often referred to as the "vertical" aspect of music
 melodic line or poliphoni, jo alag swatantra suron ke bich ke sambandhon ko ingit karti he, ke antarbunavat ko sanderbhit karne vaali vishmata is prakaar kabhi-kabhi swar sangati se utkrishth hoti he
 The word harmony is derived from the Greek ἁρμόζω which means "joint, agreement, discovery", from the verb ἁρμόζω "to put together, join"
 is shabd kaa upyog aksar sangeet ke puure kshetra ke liye kiya gaya tha, jabaki "sangeet" saamanyat: kala ke liye sanderbhit kiya gaya
 In ancient Greece, the term defined an asymmetrical combination of elements: a slightly higher and slightly lower note
 Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the simultaneous particular sound of the notes was part of ancient Greek musical practice, and Harmonia could only provide a system of classification of relationships between different pitches
 madhya yug main is shabd kaa istemaal bandish main do peach dhvaniyon ko vyakhyayit karne ke liye kiya jaataa tha or punarjagran ke dairan is avadharana kaa vistaar ek saath teen dhwani pichon ko nirupit karne ke liye kiya gaya
 The term was not used in the text contemplating musical practice until the publication of Ramea's Traité de l'harmonie in 1972, although the work is not the earliest of theoretical ideas on the subject
 in granthon ke peeche kaa antarnihit siddhant he ki swar sangati vishesh purv-sthapit sanrachanaatmak siddhanton ko samroop karte hue samasvarta ko pratibandhit karti he
 The current dictionary definition, giving a brief description, often attempts to highlight the ambiguity of the term in modern usage
 aspashtataaen yaa to saundaryashastreey kaarnon se utpann hoti hai yaa "hormonic" or contrapuntal ke bich fark bataate hue sangeet kii bunaavat ke vichaar ke kaaran
 arnold vitaal ke shabdon main: The idea that modern vocal acoustics in Western music began in 1600 is generalized in music theory
 ise praaia: punarjagran ke sangeet main aam kshaitij lekhan ke pratisthaapan ke dwaara, rachit sangeet ke 'lambavat' tatv par ek nae jor ke saath pataa lagaaya jaataa he
 Modern theorists, however, see this as an unsatisfactory generalization
 jaisaa ki karl dailhaus likhte hai: The descriptions and definitions of harmoni and harmonic practice appear to lean towards the musical traditions of Europe
 udhaaharan ke liye, dakshin asian kala sangeet kaa hawala paaramparik hormoni ke rup main pashchimi sangeet se nikalne vaale arth par thodaa-bahut dhyaan dete hue diya jaataa he, adhiktar dakshin asian sangeet ke liye antarnihit hormonic aadhaar drone hota he, yah ek held open fifth hota he jo sanrachana ke puure pravaah main peach main nahin badalata
 vishesh rup se pich samakaleenta shaayad hi kabhi ek pramukh vichaar ho paata he
 Nevertheless, many of Peach's other interpretations are relevant to music, its theory and structure, such as the complex structure of the ragas, which combines both melodic and model discourses and the codification within it
 isliye haalanki bhartiya shastreey sangeet main ek saath hi pichon kaa jatil sangyojan paidaa hota or unka shaayad hi teleological hormonic yaa contrapuntal anukram adhyayan kiya jaataa he jaisaa ki notesan kiye hue pashchimi sangeet ke saath hota he
 This contrasting emphasis reflects to some extent the various methods of performance adopted: improvised performance in Indian music plays a serious role in the structural structure of the segment, while improvised performance in Western music has been unique since the late 19th century
 
 jab yah pashchimi sangeet main ghatit hota he, tab tatatkalik pradarshan yaa to pehle se notesan kiye gaye sangeet ko sanvaar detaa he yaa, yadi nahin, to sangeet ke modelon se nishkasit kar detaa he jise pehle se hi notesan kiye gaye sangeet main sthapit kiya gaya he or isliye parichit hormonic yojanaon ko niojit karata he
 However, there is no doubt that the emphasis on preconception in European art music and in the written theories around it reflects significant cultural bias
 sangeet or sangeetkaaron kaa grove shabdkosh ise kaaphi spasht rup main paribhaashit karata he: The development of harmonic practice and language in Western art music has so far been facilitated by the same pre-structure process and was unchanged by the nature of performance, allowing study and analysis by similar theorists and composers
 sangeet pradarshan, sanrachana or siddhant kii kuch paramparaon main swar-sangati ke kuch vishisht niyam hai
 These rules are often based on natural properties such as Pythagorean tunings law hole number ratios, or harmonics and resonances, with acceptable peaches, and melody derives its beauty or simplicity from those properties
 jabaki pithagoras anupaat bodhtmak hormonicity kaa motaa anumaan pradaan kar sakate hai, vahiin ve saanskrithik tatwon ke liye javabdeh nahin ho sakate
 Early Western religious music often distinguished parallel intervals; These intervals preserve the clarity of the original planesong
 ye kaam cathedral main kiye or pradarshit kiye gaye or hormoni paidaa karne ke liye sambandhit cathedral main inke gunjyman rup kaa upyog kiya gaya
 As polyphony developed, the use of parallel intervals was gradually replaced by the English style of analogies, which used the third or sixth
 aisa mana jaataa he ki angreji style main apekshaakrit mithi dhwani hoti he or us polphoni me zyada anukool hoti he jo part-riting main adhik lenior lacheelaapan pradaan karata he
 Early music also prohibited the use of the tritone, as its consternation was related to the devil, and composers often went to greater lengths through the musica ficta to avoid its use
 nai triedic hormonic pranali main, haalanki, tritone sweekruti yogya ho gaya, kyonki vyavhaarik karkashta ke maanakeekaran ne prabhaavshaalee cord main iske upyog ko vaanchhneeya bana diya
 Although most of the melody occurs as a result of the simultaneous sounding of two or more notes, the use of arpeggios or hawkets can be strongly communicated with only one molodic line

 a first cord forms a link with a second cord and a third one with a fourth
 But the former cord link is independent of the latter and has the opposite order
 samanvit swar-sangati apratksh kii bajaay jaisaa ki adhinsth main hota he, pratyaksh sambandhon kaa anusaran karti he
 The intercalary cycle produces symmetrical melody, which has been widely used by composers such as Alban Berg, George Pearl, Arnold Schoenberg, Bella Bertock, and Edgard Varis's Density 21

 swar-sangati ke anya prakaar us swar-sangati main upyog kiye gaye cord kii rachana ke liye upyog main laae gaye antaraalon par aadhaarit hote hai
 Most of the chords used in Western music are based on the "tertian" chord composed of melody or third interval
 cord si major 7 main si-i major third hota he, i-ji miner third hota he or ji se bi ek major third hota he
 Other types of vocal consistency are made up of quartal melody and quintal melody
 interval kii do alag-alag sangeet pichon ke bich sambandh hi ek interval hota he
 For example, the tune "twinkle Twinkle Little Star" consists of the first two notes and the second two notes at intervals of one fifth
 kya iskaa matlab yah he ki yadi pehle do note pich "si" the, duusare do note pich "ji" - chaar scale note honge, yaa iske upar, saat chromatic note 
 The following are common intervals: is tarah se, apane vishisht antaraal ke saath nots kaa sangyojan - ek cord- swar-sangati banaata he
 For example, a c cord contains three notes: C, e and G
 The "C" note is the original, providing the vowel accompaniment of the "E" and "G" notes, and in the G7 chord, providing the original g vocals with each subsequent note
 sangeet ke scale main, baarah pich hote hai
 The scale of each pitch is referred to as a "degree"
 e, bi, si, di, i, epa or ji ke naam naganya hote hai
 However, the intervals are not negligible
 Here is an example: jaisaa ki dekha ja saktaa he, koi bhi note hameshaa ek nishchit degree ke scale ke anuroop nahin hota
 "root", or can be any of the 12 notes of the first-degree note scale
 anya sabhi nots jagah par girte hai
 So, when c is the original note, the fourth degree is F
 lekin jab di mul note hota he, to chauthaa degree ji hota he
 This way, while note names are fixed, this is not the case with intervals
 aam aadmi kii drushti main: ek "chauthaa" hameshaa chauthaa hi hota he, is baat se beparwaah ki mul note kya he
 The great power of this fact is that any song can be played or sung in any tone - it will be the same song, as long as the intervals are kept the same, thus the melody is transferred in the same tone is
 jab antaraal saptak ko paar kar jaataa he, to in antaraalon ko "vistaarit antaraal" naam diya jaataa hai, jisamen 9waan, 11waan or 13waan antaraal shaamil hai, jo jaij or bluej mujic main vyapak taur par istemaal kiye jate hai
 Extended intervals are created and are known as the following: is vargeekaran ke alaava, antaraalon ko samaswar or karkash main bhi vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 As explained in the following paragraphs, harmonic intervals produce a sense of relaxation and a sense of hoarse tension
 samaswar antaraalon ko samanswar, saptak, paanchavaa, chauthaa evam menger evam miner third mana jaataa he
 The third is considered incomplete, while the preceding is considered complete
 shastreey sangeet main chauthe ko karkash mana ja saktaa he jab iskaa kaary contrapuntal hota he
 Other intervals, such as the 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th are considered constrictive and require differentiation and frequent preparation
 pashchimi parampara main, swar-sangati cord kaa upyog karte hue kushalta purvak upyog main laai jaati he, jo peach shreniyon kaa sangyojan hoti hai
 In Turkish or tertiary melody, designated at intervals of a third vowel, the members of the chord are found and named by sorting the major and minor third vowel intervals, starting with "original", followed by "third" at the root
 Vowels "and" fifth vowels "on the root, etc
 Please note that the members of the cord are named based on the intervals of origin, not by their numerical interpolation in forming the cord
 
 paramparaagat rup se, cord kahalaane ke liye ek cord ke paas kam se kam teen sadsy hone chahie, haalanki 2-sadsy diaids ko kabhi-kabhi cord maan liya jaataa he, visheshkar rock main 
 teen sadasyon vile cord ko triad kaha jaataa he kyonki isamen teen sadsy hote hai, isliye nahin ki ise aavashyak rup se tisare main nirmit kiya jaataa he 
 antaraal kii chaudaai ke aadhaar par kiye ja rahe krambaddh suron ke kaaran vibhinn kism ke cord banate hai
 In popular and jazz phonetics, the chords are named based on their origin as well as their quality indicating various relationships and characters
 namavali ko jitna sambhav ho sake utana saral rakhane ke liye kuch vyatikram sweekrut kiye jate hai 
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek si major triad ke si, i, ji cord sadasyon ko vyatikram dwaara saadharantaya "si" cord kaha jaataa he
 In an 'A ♭ "cord", a ♭, c and e ♭ are members
 sangeet ke kai prakaaron, vishesh rup se barok or jaij main, cord aksar "tanaavon" ke saath sambandhit hote hai
 Tension is an additional cord member that produces a relatively tight interval with respect to one or more cord members
 tisare swaron ke stack dwaara cord nirmaan ke tersian chalan kaa anusaran karte hue, maujuud mul swar, tisare or paanchave swar ke upar sabase saral pratham tanaav ko stanking dwaara ek triad se joda jaataa he, anya tisare swar ko paanchave swar ke upar, ek nayaa swar dete hue, mul swar se alag ek saatven swar kaa shashakt rup se karkash sadsy or is tarah cord kaa "saatvaan" swar kaha jaataa he or ek four-note cord paidaa karata he, jise "saatvaan cord" kaha jaataa he
 Depending on the width of the third vowel stack alone for cord formation, the interval between the seventh vowel and the original vowel of the cord can be Major, Minor or Reduced
 
 namavali isaki anumati detii he, vyatikram rup se, "si7" mul swar, teesraa or paanchavaa yukt cord kaa sanket detaa he or saatven swar si, i, ji or bi ♭ likhaa jaataa he
 Other variants of the seventh chord should be named more explicitly, such as "C Major 7", "C augmented 7", etc
 See chord for a full exposition of the nomenclature
 saatven cord ke upar tisare swar kaa satat stack "vistaarit tanaav" yaa "upree tanaav", nauven, gyarahawein or terahaven ko laate hai or unke upar naam rakhe gaye cord kaa nirmaan karte hai
 
 Extensions beyond the thirteenth reproduce existing cord members and are left outside the nomenclature
 vistaarit cord par aadhaarit jatil swar-sangati jaij, aadhunik arcestra se sambandhit kaamon, film sangeet ityadi main bahutayat main pai jaati he
 Typically, in the common practice of classical music, a hoarse cord will "resolve" into the tuning cord
 Vocal accompaniment usually sounds pleasing to the ear when there is a balance between the sound and the hoarse sound
 saral shabdon main, vah tab ghatit hota he jab "tanaav" or "vishram" ke kshanon main santulan hota he
 For this reason, stress is usually created and then 'over'
 tanaav kii taiyaari kaa matlab he samaswar cord kii shrinkhalaa ko rakhana he, jo karkash swar tak jane kaa maarg prashast karata he
 In this way the musician makes sure to introduce tension easily and without disturbing the listener
 ek baar pis apane up charmotkarsh par pahunchataa he, shrota ko tanaav se chhootane ke liye ek pal kii jarurat padati he jise samaswar bajaakar praapt kiya jaataa he jo purvavarti cord ke tanaav ko khatm kar detaa he
 The clearing of this tension usually seems pleasant to the listener
 swar-sangati anuroopya par aadhaarit he, ek avadharana jisaki paribhaasha pashchimi sangeet ke itihaas ke dauraan kai baar badal chuki he
 In the perspective of a psychologist, conformity is continuously variable
 anuroopya ek vistrut range main bhinn ho sakati hai
 The same cord may sound different for various reasons
 ek to avadharanatmak khurdarapan kii kami he
 Roughness occurs when parcels fall within a complex bandwidth, which is a measure of the ear's ability to separate different frequencies
 jatil bandwidth ucch aavritiyon main 2 or 3 semitons ke bich rahete hai or nimna aavritiyon par bade ho jate he
 The roughness and complexity of the two simultaneous vocal-musical complex tones depends on the interval between the tones and the vocal acuity
 chromatic scale main sabase khurdara antaraal miner dwitiya or iske major saatven kaa vyatikram he
 For typical spectral envelopes in the central range, the second most rough interval is Major II and Major Seventh, followed by Tritone, Minor Third, Major Third, and Absolute Fourth
 doosraa kaaran avadharanatmak sanlayan he
 The same cord assumption fuses if its overall spectrum is the same as the harmonic series
 is paribhaasha ke anusaar ek major triad ek miner triad kii tulana main behatar fus hota he or ek major-miner saatvaan cord major-major saatven yaa miner-miner saatven kii tulana main adhik behatar fus hota he
 These differences are not apparent in contexts of immediate nature but explain why major triads in mainstream tonal music are generally more prevalent than minor triads, and major-minor seventh vocals are more prevalent than other seventh ones
 beshak ye tulanaayen style par nirbhar karti hai
 The third reason is familiarity
 cord jo ki aksar sangeet sandarbhon main sune jate hai adhik samaswar dhwani utpann karte hai
 This theory explains the gradual historical increase in harmonic complexity of Western music
 udhaaharan ke liye, 1600 ke aasapaas aprastut saatvaan cord dhire-dhire parichit ban gaya or isliye dhire-dhire adhik samaswar ke rup main mana jane laga
 Western music is based on the Major and Minor Triad
 iskaa kaaran ki ye cord kyon kendriya hai, yah he ki ve sanlayan or khurdarapan kii kami donon ke sandarbh main samaswar hote hai
 They merge because they include the fourth / fifth intervals
 unamem khurdarepan kii kami he kyonki unamem major or miner second ke antaraal kii kami hoti he
 No combination of these tones in the chromotic scale satisfies these criteria
 jaisaa ki frank jappa ne isaki vyakhya kii he, In other words, a musician cannot uniquely ensure the audience's choice by using sounding sounds
 However, additional stress may cause the listener to become upset
 donon ke bich santulan aksar vaanchhneeya mana jaataa he
 Contemporary music has evolved in such a way that tensions are often less composed or structured than in the Baroque and classical eras and thus new genres such as jazz and blues are being created, where tensions are often not created

 The founder of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Dr
 Keshav Rao Baliram Hedgewar was born on 1 April 1889 in a poor Brahmin family of Nagpur
 He was of revolutionary instinct since childhood and hated the British rulers
 While still studying in school, Keshav Rao, along with some of his classmates, greeted him with "vande Mataram" Jayghosh when the British inspector came to the school for inspection, on which he went to bipher and on his orders Keshav Rao was expelled from the school
 Gone Then he completed his studies till matriculation in the National School of Poona

 Balakrishna Shivram Munje, his disciples Dr
 Hedgewar, Mr
 Paranjpe and Bapu Sahib Soni laid the foundation of a Hindu youth club, which was later renamed the National self-service Association

 In this, all the people who believe in and practice the views of religions and religions like Sanatani, Aryasamaji, Jain, Buddhist, Sikh etc
 are Hindu The Muslims and Christians did not fall under this definition, so it was decided not to take them in this militia and it was decided to take only Hindus, the main mantra
 Was "prevention of Ambiguity and Military Causes of Hindus"

 Prayers also came to be known as "prayers" started in Sanskrit language instead of Marathi
 For senior volunteers, OTC Camps were started where they were also given paramilitary education
 For all these works, the services of a retired military officer Mr
 Martande Rao Jog were used
 By 1935-36 such branches were limited to Maharashtra only and its volunteers
 The number was only a few thousand, but the enthusiasm of the Sarsanghchalak and volunteers was worth seeing
 Dr
 Hedgewar himself was so excited that in one of his address he said Key: - “sangh ke janmkaal ke samay kii paristhiti badi vicitra si thi, hinduon kaa hindusthan kahana us samay niraa paagalpan samajha jaataa tha or kisi sanghathan ko hindu sanghathan kahana desh droh tak ghoshit kar diya jaataa tha” l In the tragic situation that Dr
 Hedgewar expressed, the effort of the leadership of the newly formed Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha - with the courage among the Hindu youth, resonated with the slogan "hindusthan Hindus - not anyone's father"
 Dr
 Hedgewar said in these words: - “kai sajjan yah kehete hue bhi nahin hichkichaate kii hindusthan keval hinduo kaa hi kaise? yah to un sabhi logon kaa he jo yahan basate hai l khed he kii is prakaar kaa kathan / akshep karne vaale sajjanon ko raashtra shabd kaa arth hi gyaat nahin l keval bhoomi ke kisi tukade ko raashtra nahin kehete l ek vichaar-ek aachaar-ek sabhyataa evam parampara main jo log puraatan kaal se rahete chale aae hai unheen logon kii samskruti se raashtra banataa he l is desh ko hamaare hi kaaran hindusthan naam diya gaya he l duusare log yadi samopchaar se is desh main basna chaahate hai to avashya bas sakate hai l hamane unhen na kabhi manaa kiya he na karenge l kintu jo hamaare ghar atithi ban kar aate hai or hamaare hi gale par churi pherane par utaaru ho jate hai unke liye yahan ratti bhar bhi sthaan nahin milegaa l sangh kii is vichaardhaara ko pehle aap thik thaak samaj lijie l” On another occasion, Dr
 Hedgewar had said, "the Sangh wants only the Hindusthan Hindus - to make this motto true," similar to other countries, "because of the Hindus" - what Hindus in this country would say That will be the former direction
 This is the only thing that the Sangh knows, there is no need for the volunteers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to fall into any other crisis
 " jab vir saavarkar ratnagiri main drushti band the, tab dow headgavar vahaan unase milane gayi
 By then he had also read the book Hindutva by Veer Savarkar
 dow headgavar us pustak ke vichaaron se bahut prabhavit hue or uski saraahna karte hue bole ki “vir saavarkar ek adarsh vyakti he”
 Both believed that Hindus would be divided into casteism, untouchability, urban-migrants and regionalism, till Hindus would not leave blind faith, old orthodox thinking, religious fanatics, and until it would be organized and united, Until then, he will not be able to take his rightful place in the world

 pracheen kaal main ek sahukaar tha, jiske saat bete or saat bahuen thi
 The moneylender also had a daughter who came to her maternal home from her in-laws in Deepawali
 deepawali par ghar ko lipane ke liye saaton bahuen mitti laane jangal main gai to nanad bhi unke saath ho lee
 Sahukar's daughter lived with her sons at the place where the soil was cut
 mitti katate hue galati se sahuukaar kii beti kii khurpy ke chot se syahu kaa ek baccha mar gaya
 Syahu became angry and said, i will bind your womb
 syahu ke vachan sunakar sahuukaar kii beti apni saaton bhabhiyon se ek ek kar vinati karti hai ki vah uske badale apni kokh bandhawa len
 The youngest sister-in-law agrees to get her womb tied in lieu of sister-in-law
 iske baad choti bhabhi ke jo bhi bachche hote hai ve saat din baad mar jate hai
 After the death of seven sons in this way, he called the Pandit and asked the reason for this
 pandit ne surahi gaay kii seva karne kii salaah di
 Surhi is pleased with the service and takes it to Syahu
 raste thak jane par donon aaraam karne lagate hai achaanak sahukaar kii choti bahu kii nazar ek ore jaati hai, vah dekhati he ki ek saanp garuda pankhni ke bachche ko dansane ja rahaa he or vah saanp ko maar detii he

 Garuda Phanni is happy on this and brings them to Syahu along with Surhi

 Regardless of the method you perform the puja, both of them keep water filled in an urn for worship

 After the puja, touch the feet of Sasu Maa and receive her blessings

 This dog made with fungus oil, duck liver pieces and fungus butter sold for $ 69
 hot dog vikritaon kii neshnal associationsaanchaa:hotdogs Part of a category on Sikhism sikh dharm ek akeshwarwadi dharm he
 Followers of this religion are called Sikhs
 sikhon kaa dharmik granth shri aadi granth yaa gyaan guru granth sahib he
 Usually 10 Satgurs of Sikhs are considered, but the religious text of Sikhs is composed of 30 Bhagats including 6 Gurus, whose same Sikhs are considered important for walking on the Sikh path
 sikhon ke dharmik sthaan ko gurudwara kehete hai
 Born in Punjab in 1469 AD, Nanak Dev discovered Gurmat and spread the Sikh teachings of Gurmat by going to the country longitude itself
 sikh unhen apana pehla guru maanate hai
 Gurmat was considered by the remaining 9 Gurus
 10ve guru gobind singh ji ne ye parchaar khalsa ko sonpa or gyaan guru granth sahib kii sikhyaon par amla karne kaa upadesh diya
 The saints Kabir, Dhana, Sadhana, Ramanand, Parmanand, Namdev Itiyadi, whose Bani etc
 are recorded in the scripture, also consider those Bhagats as Sikh Satgurus and try to follow their teachings
 sikh ek hi ishwar ko maanate hai, jise ve ek-onkaar kehete hai
 They believe that God is famine and nirankar
 bharat main sikh panth kaa apana ek pavitra evam anupam sthaan he sikhon ke pratham guru, gurunanak dev sikh dharm ke pravartak hai
 He dispelled the evil practices, superstitions, shabby stereotypes and hypocrisies prevalent in the Indian society of his time
 unhone prem, seva, parishram, paroapkaar or bhai-chaare kii drudh niv par sikh dharm kii sthapana kii
 Not surprisingly, from a liberal perspective, Guru Nanak Dev embraced the goodness of all religions
 unka mukhya upadesh tha ki ishwar ek he, usee ne sabko banaaya he
 Hindu Muslims are all children of the same God and all are equal for God
 unhone yah bhi bataaya he ki ishwar satya he or manushya ko achche kaary karne chahie taaki paramatma ke darbar main use lajjit na hona pade
 Guru Nanak has said in one of his books that Pandits read pothi, but do not understand the idea
 dusron ko upadesh dete hai, isse unka maaya kaa vyapaar chalata he
 His words are false, he wanders into the world
 inhen sabad ke saar kaa koi gyaan nahin he
 These pundits are still in debate
 guru arjuna dev to yahan tak kehete hai ki paramatma vyapak he jaise sabhi vanaspatiyon main aag samaayi hui he evam doodh main ghi samaaya hua he
 In the same way, the light of the divine is prevalent in everyone, the divine is spread in all its parts
 sikh dharm ko majboot or maryadasmpann banane ke liye guru arjuna-dev ne aadi granth kaa sampadan karke ek bahut bada aitihaasik evam shaashvat kaary kiya
 He also honored the compositions of 15 saints and 14 creators with five Sikh Gurus in the Adi Granth
 in paanch guruon ke naam hai- guru nanak, guru angaddev, guru amardaas, guru ramdaas or guru arjunadev
 Guruji showed his benevolent humanist vision by storing the speech of 15 saints in Shaikh Farid, Jayadeva, Trilochan, Sadhana, Namdev, Veni, Ramananda, Kabir, Ravidas, Pipa, Saitha, Dhanna, Bhikhan, Parmanand and Surdas
 itnaa hi nahin, unhone haribans, balha, mathura, gaynd, nalh, bhall, salh bhikkha, kirat, bhai maradaana, sundardaas, raai balwand evam satta duum, kalsahaar, jaalp jaise 14 rachanakaaron kii rachanaaon ko aadigranth main sthaan dekar unhen ucch sthaan pradaan kiya
 While doing this amazing work, no limitation of religion, caste, region and language was created in front of Guru Arjun Dev
 unhen maaloom tha in sabhi guruon, santon evam kaviyon kaa saanskrithik, vaicharik evam chintanparak aadhaar ek hi he
 It is noteworthy that when Guru Arjunadeva completed the editing work of Adigranth in 1604 AD, then the first five gurus had the works in it
 iske baad guru govind singh ne apane pita guru teg bahadur kii vaani shaamil karke aadigranth ko antim rup diya
 There are a total of 778 posts of 15 saints in the adi-granth
 inamen 541 kabir ke, 122 shaikh farid ke, 60 namdev ke or 40 sant ravidaas ke hai
 One to four positions of other saints have been placed in the Adi Granth
 gauratlab he ki aadi granth main sangrahit ye rachanaayen gat 400 varshon se adhik samay ke bina kisi parivartan ke puri tarah surakshit hai
 But the former Guru Gobind Singh, before his death, appointed Guru Granth Saheb for the spiritual guidance of all Sikhs and the entire Khalsa Panth for 'worldly direction' as 'guru Pad'
 us samay aadigranth guru sahab ke rup main sweekaar kiya jane laga
 Guru Gobind Singh initiated people of all religions and castes into the guru-shishya-tradition to make Sikhism a classic
 unhone aane vaali shatabdiyon ke liye is nae manushya kaa srijan kiya
 This new human being is not always divided into castes and religions, is always committed to the protection of religion, human and country
 sabko saath lekar chalane kii yah sancharana, nihsandeh, sikh maanas kii thati he
 Then, the ultimate goal of Sikhism is human welfare
 kadaachit isi maanav-kalyaan kaa sabak sikhaane ke liye guru govind singh ne aurangzeb ko ek lambaa patr likhaa tha, jisamen ishwar kii stuti ke saath-saath aurangzeb ke shashan-kaal main ho rahe anyaay tathaa atyaachaar kaa maarmik ullekh he
 In this letter, the pretext of doing righteous deeds and not shedding the blood of innocent subjects, cracking under the guise of religion and God and warning for lies and like a warrior, is a war to fight in the battlefield
 kaha jaataa he ki is patr ko padhakar aurangzeb kii runh kaanp uthi thi or iske baad vah adhik samay tak jivit nahin rahaa
 Even his inner desire to meet Guruji could not be fulfilled
 yah koi shrey lene-dene vaali baat nahin he ki sikh guruon kaa sahaj, saral, sada or swaabhaavik jivan jin mulyon par aadhaarit tha, nishchay hi un mulyon ko unhone paramparaagat bhartiya chetana se grahan kiya tha
 According to the demand of the country, time and circumstances, he had deeply influenced the political, social, religious, economic and cultural life of the then by changing his personality
 sikh guruon ne apane samay ke dharm or samaaj-vyavastha ko prabhavit kiya tha
 The Sikh Gurus gave a new direction to the religion and social order of their time
 unhone bhakthi, gyaan, upasna, aadhyatm evam darshan ko ek sankeern daayre se nikaalkar samaaj ko us tabake ke bich pahunchaa diya, jo isse purnat: vanchit the
 This awakened the self-realization of the people and a new vision and awareness arose in them, they started recognizing the self-realized experience
 is prakaar nirgun niraakaar param shakti kaa pravaah prakhar evam twarit rup se praapt hua
 Another peculiarity of Sikhism is that Sikh Gurus talked about human beings venturing into life, achieving happiness while earning and attaining God by meditating
 unka maananaa tha ki parishram karanevaala vyakti sabhi chintaaon se mukt rahata he
 Guru Nanak has even said that the person who earns hard work and does some charity in it, he recognizes the right path
 sikh guruon dwaara prarambh kii gai ‘lungar’ pratha vishvabandhutv, maanav-prem, samanta evam udaartaa kii anyatra na pai jane vaali misaal he
 Sikh Gurus also established cultural and moral values that never fade
 unhone apane darshanik evam aadhyatmik chintan se bhaanp liya tha ki aane vaala samay kaisaa hoga
 Therefore, he insisted on alternative thinking against blind copying
 shaareerik-abhyaas evam vinodashiltaa ko jivan kaa aavashyak ang mana
 Punjabi folk songs, folk dances and Hola Mahalla are the inspiration-seeds of the Sikh Gurus at the core of their performance
 in lokgeeton evam lok nrityon kii jaden punjab kii dharti se footati hai or logon main thirakan paidaa karti hai
 Bhangra and Giddha are the cultural pride of Punjab, whose beats are often heard in India and abroad
 punjabi samskruti rashtriyata kaa merudand he
 There is unity in its soul, sympathy, cooperation, compassion and human love in its blood
 punjabi samskruti aadmi se jodatii he or uski pahchaan banaati he
 a Punjabi wandering in any corner of the world is one of its own miniature Punjab
 prayek sikh kii apni swatantra chetana he, jo jivan-sambandhi samasyaon ko apane hi prakaash main sulajhane ke uddeshy se gambheer rup se vichaar karti ai he
 Take the history of the Sikh Gurus, they did not formulate the imperialist concept at all, instead they kept on looking at the humanitarian world through cultural, religious and spiritual harmony
 azaadi ke purv, bharat-paak vibhaajan evam iske baad kai dashakon main punjab main samay-samay par aae hinsaatmak-zalazalon evam nirdayee vidhwanson ke baavjood is dharti ke logon ne apana shantipurna astitv banaae rakhaa he
 The guidance has been flashes
 sikhon ke das guru he
 Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji is a religious book of Sikhs
 sikhamat kii shuruyaat hi "ek" se hoti he
 The Sikh scriptures only interpret "one"
 ek ko nirankaar, parbrahm adik gunavachak naamon se janaa jaataa hai
 The form of Nirankar is mentioned at the beginning of Sri Gurugranth Sahib, which is called 'mool Mantra' in common language
 takreeban sabhi dharm isi "ek" kii aradhana karte hai, lekin "ek" kii vibhinn avasthaaon kaa zikr va vyakhya shri guru granth sahib ji main di gai he wo apane aap main niraali he
 The living soul which is formless, has only 4 qualities of Nirankar
 baaki chaar gun praapt karte hi jeev aatma vaapis nirankaar main samaa jaati he, lekin usko praapt karne ke liye jeev aatma ko khud ko gurmat ke gyaan dwaara samajhnaa zaruri he
 It is called "soul contemplation" in Sikhism
 aatma kaa niraakaari swaroop man, chit, surat, budhi, mati adik kii jaankaree sikh dharm ke mul sikhyaon main di jaati he
 By understanding these activities, a person can understand himself
 sikh dharm kii shuruyaat hi aatam gyaan se hoti he
 What is soul? Where did it come from? Why does it exist? What to do is Etihadi is taught by special Sikh propaganda of spirituality
 aatma ke vikaar kya hai, kaise vikaar mukt ho
 The soul itself is part of the nirankar
 iskaa gyaan karavaate karavaate nirankaar kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 Sikhism does not believe in personnel philosophy
 anya dharmo kaa kahana he ki prabhu ko ache karm pasand hai or bure karmo waalon ke saath parameshwar bahut bura karata he
 But according to Sikhism, humans cannot do anything themselves
 insaan sirf sochane tak simit he karata vahi he jo "hukum" main he, chaahe wo kisi garib ko daan de rahaa ho chaahe wo kisi ko jaan se maar rahaa ho
 The same thing was made firm by Shri Gurugranth Sahib at the beginning: isi liye gurmat main paap punya ko nahin man jaataa
 If a person performs an action, then that difference should be done by mixing voice with soul
 yahi karn he kii gurmat karm cond ke viruddh he
 Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji tried to liberate the common people from the clutches of the contractors, pandas, pirs etc
 of religion by removing the prevalent practices, superstitions, shabby stereotypes and hypocrisy in the Indian society of his time
 nimnlikhit chaar 'padaarth' maanav ko apane jeevankaal main praapt karnaa anivaary he : Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha were not taken into four substances
 shri guru gobind singh ji kehete hai: In Sikhism, devotees and Satgurus have called Nirankar without formlessness
 kyonki sansaarik padaarth to ek din khatm ho jate hai lekin parabrahm kabhi nahin marataa
 That is why it has been called a famine
 yahi nahin jeev aatma bhi aakar rahit he or is sharir ke saath kuch samay ke liye bandhi he
 Its existence is without the body, which is far from the intelligence of the common man
 yahi karn he kii sikhamat murti puja ke sakht khilaaf he
 Satgurus and devotees have treated idol worshipers with blind, animal etiquette words
 us kii tasviir bane nahin ja sakati
 Not only this, any worldly material like Kabar, historical things of devotees and Satgurus, idols are worshiped against the basic principles of Sikhs
 dharmik granth kaa gyaan ek vidhi jo nirankaar ke desh kii taraf lekar jaati he, jiske samaksh sikh natmastak hote hai, lekin dharmik granthon kii puja bhi sikhon ke bunayadi usulon ke khilaaf he
 In Sikhism, every living being is called an avatar
 har jeev us nirankaar kii ansh he
 Any panchi, animal, tree, etc
 are incarnations in the world
 maanush kii yoni main jeev apana gyaan puraa karne ke liye avatarit hua he
 The person is not worshiped in Sikhism as "god forbid that everyone is alive, giving, AK God"
 tamaam avatar ek nirankaar kii shart par puure nahin utarate koi bhi ajooni nahin he
 This is the reason that Sikhs do not consider anyone as God
 haan agar koi avatar gurmat kaa upades karata he to sikh us upadesh ke saath zarur jude rahete hai
 As Krishna has said in the Gita that soul does not die and death does not happen, Sikhism agrees with this, but further Krishna has said that karma is the religion from which Sikhism does not agree
 pigambar wo he jo nirankaar kaa sandesh athwa gyaan aam lokai main baante
 As it is said in Islam that Muhammad is the last prophet, it is said among the Sikhs that "every jug jug bhakta upaaya"
 bhakt same dar same paidaa hote hai or nirankaar kaa sandesh logon tak pahunchaate hai
 Sikhism agrees with "la ilaha ill Allah" but only Muhammad is not Rasul Allah
 arjuna dev ji kehete hai "dhur kii bani ai, tin sagali chint mitaai", arthath mujhe dhur se vaani ai he or meri sagal chintaaen mit gai hai kionki jisaki taak main main baitha tha mujhe wo mil gaya he
 Originally, the statement of devotees Avam Satguru was done by Satguru Arjun Dev Ji, which is called Adi Granth, is famous as a religious text of Sikhs
 This book is a true sermon of 36 devotees and it is astonishing that 36 devotees have lectured Nirankar in equal view
 There is no difference in a word
 Along with the Sikh Adi Granth, the Dasam Granth, which is the collection of the speech of Satguru Gobind Singh Ji, is also considered
 This book is under the Khalsa
 But taking knowledge of Adi Granth in the original form is the best practice for Sikhs
 yahi nahin sikh har us granth ko sammaan dete hai, jisame gurmat kaa upadesh he | Adi Granth or Adi Guru Granth or Guru Granth Sahib or Adi Guru Darbar or Pothi Sahib, is a religious book compiled by Guru Arjun Dev, which records the experiences of the spiritual life of 36 devotees
 The Adi Granth is said to be because of the knowledge of "adi" in it
 According to the chanting, "truth" is the beginning
 The scripture that makes it known is called Adi Granth
 Its references are within the text itself
 However, Vidwan says that because this book was not made by Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, this is why it is an Adi Granth and Satguru Gobind Singh Ji climbed the 9th palace, hence this Adi Granth was called Jagan Guru Granth
 bhakton evam satguruon kii vaani potheon ke rup main satguru arjuna dev ji ke samay mojood thim | bhai gurdas ji ne yah granth likhaa or satguru arjuna dev ji disha nirdharak bane | unhon ne apni vaani bhi granth main darj kii | yah granth kii kai nakle bhi taiyaar hui | 1430 pages of Adi Granth were standardized by the Khalsa
 dasam granth, sikhon kaa dharmagranth he jo satgur gobind singh ji kii pavitra vaani evam rachnaao kaa sangrah he
 Guru Gobind Singh ji made many compositions during his lifetime, whose small books were made
 un kii maut ke baad un kii dharm patni mata sundari kii ajna se bhai mani singh khalsa or anya khalsa bhaaiyon ne guru gobind singh ji kii sari rachnaao ko iktha kiya or ek jild main chadha diya jise aaj "dasam granth" kaha jaataa he
 Simply put, Guru Gobind Singh ji composed and Khalsa edited
 dasam granth kaa satkar sari sikh kaum karti he
 The Vāsānī of the Dāsam Granth such as Jaap Sahib, Tāva Parsād Savaiye and Chopai Sahib are part of the daily Sajda, Nitnem, of the Sikhs, and these Vanyas are read while making Khande Bate's Pahol, which is called Amrit Chakna in the common language
 takhat hajur sahib, takhat patna sahib or nihang singh ke gurudwaron main dasam granth kaa guru granth sahib ke saath parkash hota hai or rose hukamname bhi liya jaataa he
 The attacks of Sarabloh Granth and Bhai Gurdas are doubtless creations
 However, the Khalsa Mahima is adorned in the Sarbloh Granth which is the authenticated work of Satguru Gobind Singh, the rest of the Srabloh text contains a karma scandal, a person worshiping itiyadi vizhi mojud who is against the basic principles of the Sikhs
 The words of Bhai Gurdas are recorded in the words of idol worship, karma doctrine etc

 Many unbiased authors agreed with Abe Sikar's evaluation
 teleraan bahut chatur or chaalaak vyakti tha, rajnay kaa kushal khilaadi tha or paristhitiyon ke anusaar chaalaaki se apni swamibhakti badal letaa tha
 He believed in opportunistic diplomacy
 krantikaal main rashtriya sabha ke nirmaan ke baad jab 19 june 1789 ko padariyon ne tritiy state ke saath mil jane kaa faisla kiya to arq bishap teleraan ne kranti ko apane paksh main modane kaa asafal prayaas kiya

 Later, on Ramachandra Deb establishing an independent kingdom in Khurda, the temple and its idols were restored
 
 According to the traditional legend associated with the origin of this temple, the original idol of Lord Jagannath made of Indranil or Sapphire was found under an Agaru tree
 yah itani chakchaundh karne vaali thi, ki dharm ne ise prithvi ke neeche chupaana chaha
 Malwa King Indradyumna saw this idol in his dream
 tab usne kadi tapasya kii or tab bhagwaan vishnu ne use bataaya ki vah puri ke samudr tat par jaye or use ek daaru kaa laththa milegaa
 He should build the idol with the same wood
 raja ne aisa hi kiya or use lakdi kaa laththa mil bhi gaya
 The king then appeared before him as Vishnu and Vishwakarma carpenter artisan and sculptor
 kintu unhone yah shart rakhi, ki ve ek maah main murti taiyaar kar denge, parantu tab tak vah ek kamare main band rahenge or raja yaa koi bhi us kamare ke andar nahin aaye
 On the last day of the month, when there was no sound for many days, the king eagerly peeped into the room and the old artisan came out by opening the door and told the king that the idols were still incomplete, his hands were not yet made
 raja ke afsos karne par, murtikar ne bataaya, ki yah sab daivavash hua he or yah murtiyon aise hi sthapit hokar puji jaayengin
 Then the idols of the same three Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra were installed in the temple

 lekin yah sambhav naa ho sakaa, kyoki us samay tak, british ne punjab par apana adhikaar karke, unki sabhi shahi sampatti jabt kar lee thi
 Otherwise Kohinoor diamond would have been the pride of the crown of Lord Jagannath

 There is a long parasitic arrangement, that is, there is a special pattern of the arrangement of particles, which is repeated in a certain order
 crystalia thoso kaa galnaank nishchit hota he
 Crystalline solids are heterogeneous in nature, ie some of their physical properties, such as electrical resistivity and refractive index, exhibit different values when measured in different directions in the same crystal
 yah alag- alag dishaao main kanon kii bhin vyavastha se utpann hota he
 When the arrangement of particles is different in different directions, the value of the same physical property is found to be different in each direction
