 ] Husen Shaheed Suhrawardy was born on September 8 in a village called Midnapur
 unka parivaar ek bengali musalmaan parivaar tha
 Today this place is in West Bengal
 unke pita jaahid suhravardi, ek nami nyaayadish the kalakatta ucch nyaayalay me
 His interest was always in politics
 unhone tab bhartiya rashtriya congress kaa bhaag,swarajya dal main shaamil hue
 He was a main part of the Bengal Treaty
 pakistan ke aazaadee ke baad unhone apni raajnneetik kaamo ko purv bengal tak hi varjit rakhaa
 Soon after he became the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 1945, he announced on national radio that he would create a large army in Pakistan through which he promised to raise arms against India
 afsos is baat kaa hi he ki itane vaade karne ke baad,vah pradhan mantri kursii par sirf 13 mahino tak tik paae mrityu unhone dhaka main khwaja najimudan ke kabr ke bagal main gada gaya he
 Hussein's time in his post was brief
 unke jagah pe iskundar mirza ne apane hakk jamaaya
 It is believed that Mirza did not always want Hussein to become a national husband
 unhone hossain kaa naam ke liye ha adhe dil se hi bolaa tha
 In the biography of Husain Shaheed, it is said that the martyr had suffered a lot in his last time
 vah kaphi udhaas ore saath hi saath akele bhi the
 Iqramulah his cousin has told in the biography of Hussain that he had a lot of personal and personal problems in his life
 unhone jo bhi bataaya he wo hame ek mukhya tareeke main kaaphi madad karata iske dawaare hame pakistan ke rajaniti ke bare main pataa chalata he
 It shows us how many incidents happened immediately after Pakistan's independence
 bhale hi suhravardi or mirza main dushamani thi,par ek baar suhravardi raashtra-pati bane to unki dosti kii shuruyaat hui
 One more thing Hussain is famous for and he wanted the jinn to be part of the Muslim League
 vah unhe bengal praant ke mukhya netaa banaan chahaate the
 He never made economic profit from his political business
 iske bajaay vah apane roji roti ke liye vakaalat karte the or kaphi naam bhi kamaate the
 He was also thrown out of the Muslim leg
 itnaa sab ho jane ke baad bhi suhravardi ko phir pakistan aane kaa moka mila
 Then the new Governor General of Pakistan Ghulam Mohammad was called back
 unhe apane rajanaitik kaarobaar main unki madad chahie thi
 He was bedridden several days before his death
 unki maut bhi kaaphi sangharsh ke saath hui
 He died on 5 December 1963
 unki maut ki vajah dil kaa doraa thi
 His tomb is in Dhaka

 unka kahana tha ki dhan kii seva, ahankaar or vansh swamipan - ek hi maansikta ke do paksh hai- 'yes we will say, do not do anything
 maaya aru swami pani, doi-doi baat na hoi
 
 ’ Saint Bakhna used to emphasize the need to awaken the self
 yadi ham sachhee sadhana karen to paramatma swayan aakar hamase milenge- 'find a deep kite, so Varkhanam Vird La Jai' deepak maahai joti whai, to ghanaan miliga ai
 ' kehete hai ajmer jate hue samraat jahangir narayana main tehre the
 He asked Kazi and the pundits to test Bakhna ji, what kind of creation did God create? sant bakhana ji ne kaha- All this happened, so we did the idea

 ' ve kehete the ki sadhu santon kii vaani ko apnaanaa chahie, kyonki vahi samaaj ko dhokar nirmal banaati he

 in ghadiyon kii kaaryastylee or kshamta din ke samay tak simit hoti thi kyonki yah raat ke samay kaam nahin kar paati thim
 Nevertheless, they were first used to know the time in the world
 inhen ghadiyon ko aadhaar banaakar samay bataane vaali anya ghadiyon kaa avishkaar hua tha
 Solar clocks have been used in India since ancient Vedic times
 surya siddhant main saura ghadi dwaara samay maapan ke shuddh tareeke adhyay 3 or 13 main varnit hai
 Early solar clocks worked only in the morning and afternoon
 in ghadiyon kii nirmaan vidhi main ek bade stambh ko ek sire se baandhakar jameen main gaad diya jaataa tha or surya ke ghoomane ke saath-saath jameen par padi stambh kii chaaya se samay kaa anumaan lagaaya jaataa tha
 The shadow of the pillar was the smallest during the mid-day, which showed that the sun is located in the middle of the sky
 pashchimi asia or misr kii sabhyataaon main aisi ghadiyon kaa bahut prayog kiya jaataa tha
 The inventors then produced more types of watches that allowed the time of day to be divided into several strikes, however, the hours were somewhat longer than today
 kai sabhyataaon main rituon ke anusaar saura ghadiyaan samay bataane lagi or kai sthanon par to ve din or raat kii baraabar lambaaiyon jaise durlabh dinon kaa bhi gyaan karaati thim
 Many cultures also have human solar clocks in which a person stands in a fixed place and finds the time from the changing shape of his shadow
 saura ghadiyon ke sahi kaam karne ke liye yah aavashyak hota tha ki unhen sahi sthanon par sthapit kiya jaae
 The sun was in different directions at different times in different places of the world, so clocks had to be set according to the direction of the sun
 iskaa ek tarika yah he ki saura ghadi ko is tarah sthapit kiya jaae ki surya ke thik akaash ke bich main hone par parchaai bilkul sidhi dikhe

 The credit of expanding and strengthening the Mauryan Empire goes to Emperor Ashoka
 yah samrajya purv main magadh rajya main ganga nadi ke maidaanon se shuru hua
 Its capital was Pataliputra
 chandragupta maury ne 322 isa purv main is samrajya kii sthapana kii or teji se pashchim kii taraf apana samrajya kaa vikaas kiya
 He took advantage of the differences of several small regional states which were born after the invasion of Alexander

 The Maurya dynasty greatly expanded in the kingdom of Chakravarti Emperor Ashoka
 samraat ashok ke kaaran hi maury samrajya sabase mahaan evam shaktishaalee banakar vishvabhar main prasiddh hua
 In 325 BCE, northwestern India was ruled by the satrap of Sikandar
 jab sikandar punjab par chadhaai kar rahaa tha to ek brahman jiskaa naam chanakya tha magadh ko samrajya vistaar ke liye protsaahit karne aayaa
 At that time, Magadha was quite powerful and pricked the eyes of its neighboring states
 par tatkaaleen magadh ke samraat ghananand ne usko thukraa diya
 He said that you are a pundit and take care of your peak "war is the king's job, you are a pundit, only do panditai"
 Since then Chanakya took a vow that he would teach Dhanananda a lesson
 maury pracheen kshatriya kabeeley ke hisse rahe he
 According to Greek sources such as Brahmin literature, Visakhadatta Mudrarakshas and Justin, etc
, there were no opinions of historians about the origin of Maurya
 Some scholars also believe that Chandragupta Maurya has originated from his mother Mura
 Maurya is, they were the clan that followed the peacocks
 parantu yah bhi sateek nahi baithta bhartiya itihaas main yah pehali baar hua mata ke naam se putr kaa vansh chalaa ho maury ek shaktishaalee vansh tha vah unke pita se viraasat main mili thi putr kaa naam pita se hi judaa hota he, unki utpatti vrushal vansh se huyi thi, lekin iskaa koi bhi pramaan itihaas main uplabdh nahin he yah keval tark he kuki ajtak itihaas main kisi ne bhi apane vansh kaa naam mata ke naam se nahin rakhaa, to kuch itihaaskaaro kaa yah sirf anumaan he
 
 chandragupta usee gana pramukh kaa putr tha jo kii chandragupta ke bal avasthaa main hi yoddha ke rup main maaraa gaya
 Chandragupta had the natural qualities to become a king ', seeing this ability, Chanakya made him his disciple, and laid the foundation of a strong nation which is an ideal till date
 iske baad bharat bhar main jasuson kaa ek jaal sa bicha diya gaya jisase raja ke khilaaf gaddari ityadi kii gupt soochna ekatra karne main kiya jaataa tha - yah bharat main shaayad abhootpurv tha
 Once this happened, he prepared Chandragupta to drive away the Greek satraps
 is kaary main use guptcharon ke vistrut jaal se madad mili
 In the invasion of Magadha, Chanakya provoked civil war in Magadha
 uske guptcharon ne nand ke adhikariyon ko rishwat dekar unhe apane paksh main kar liya
 After this, the Nanda ruler left his post and Chanakya got Vijayashree
 nand ko nirvasit jivan jeena padaa jiske baad uskaa kya hua ye agyaat he
 Chandragupta Maurya also won the public's trust and with this he also got the right to power
 us samay magadh bharat kaa sabase shaktishaalee rajya tha
 After the capture of Magadha, Chandragupta occupied the center of power
 chandragupta ne pashchimi tathaa dakshini bharat par vijay abhiyaan aarambh kiya
 Its information comes from indirect evidence
 rudradaaman ke junagarh shilaalekh main likhaa he ki sinchai ke liye sudarshan jhil par ek band pushyagupt dwaara banaaya gaya tha
 Pushyagupta was the provincial governor of Ashoka at that time
 pashchimottar bharat ko unani shashan se mukti dilaane ke baad uskaa dhyaan dakshin kii taraf gaya
 Chandragupta defeated Alexander's commander Seleucus around 305 BC
 greek vivaran is vijay kaa ullekh nahin karte hai par itnaa kehete hai ki chandragupta or celukas ke bich ek sandhi hui thi jiske anusaar celukas ne qandahar, kabul, heraat or baluchistan ke pradesh chandragupta ko de die the
 With this, Chandragupta presented him 500 elephants
 itnaa bhi kaha jaataa he chandragupta ne celukas kii beti se vaivaahik sambandh sthapit kiya tha
 Seleucus sent Megasthenes to the court of Chandragupta as ambassador

 This comment may be called a little exaggeration because it is known that the Cauvery river and its south areas were ruled by the Cholas, Pandyas, Satyaputras and Keralaputras at that time

 The education system of the Pandit congregation did not meet the requirements of the time, in which the knowledge-sciences of the present era did not have any place, it nurtured the hypocrisies

 Rishi Dayanand felt that these defects should be removed by reviving the ancient Gurukul system in India
 unhone shiksha ke aadarshon or siddhanton kaa pratipaadan ‘satyarth prakaash' ke tisare samullas main kiya -nihsandeh rishi dayanand ke vichaar shiksha ke kshetra main atyant krantikari vichaar the
 Mahatma Munshi Ram, a prominent disciple of Rishi Dayanand in 1897, gave the following reasons for the need to start Gurukula - 19veen shatabdi main bharat main do prakaar kii shikshapaddatiyaan prachlit thim
 The first method was the system of government schools and universities developed by the British government to meet the requirements of its governance and the second was the school system of studying various disciplines of Sanskrit, grammar, philosophy, etc
, in the ancient traditional method
 donon paddatiyon main kuch gambhir dosha the
 In the first system, there was a great expectation of post-scriptural knowledge and it was completely national

 Hence, the emphasis was on the study of English and Western literature and science of knowledge in the government education system, neglecting Indian poetry
 is shiksha paddati kaa pradhan uddeshy mekale ke shabdon main 'bharatiyon kaa ek aisa samooh paidaa karnaa tha, jo rang tathaa rakt kii drushti se to bhartiya ho, parantu ruchi, mati or achaar-vichaar kii drushti se angrej ho'
 Therefore, this teaching was contrary to the national and religious ideals of India
 duusari shiksha pranali, panditmandli main prachlit paathshaala paddati thi
 Although Indian poetry was studied in it, there was a gross neglect of knowledge science necessary for the new and present time

 30 oktober 1898 ko unhone isaki vistrut yojana rakhi
 In November 1898, the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha, the central organization of the Arya Samaj of Punjab, accepted the proposal to open a gurukula and Mahatma Munshiram pledged that he would stay in his house until he collected Rs 30,000 for this task

 The salient features of the Gurukul education system are - students are in touch with the Gurus, to be part of their clan or family, to live a simple and ascetic life in a holistic manner, to pay full attention to character building and physical development like intellectual and mental development, to Sanskrit in education
 Making compulsory, emphasizing the study of Vedic poetry, making Hindi the medium of education, Sanskrit, Dar No, Veda, etc

 unhone apane ek patr main gurukul ke sambandh main vichaar prakat kiye - a well-known scholar of that era, Mr
 Nivas Shastri was a great supporter of English as a medium of higher education, but on finding the work of Gurukul satisfactory, he said - 'my own view has been that the medium of instruction in the school department should be Indian languages
 Should be, but college department should study through English
 parantu ab gurukul ko dekhakar main apane is vichaar se pare hat rahaa hoon
 The most important and fundamental effort in education in India after Macaulay is Gurukul - Ramje mcdonald gurukul kangri kaa sabasen bada kartrutv apane kriyaatmak pareekshan dwaara in vichaaron ko sarvamaanya bananaa tha
 Earlier it was considered impossible that Hindi can become the medium of teaching of higher education and study of scientific subjects

 hindi ke vaigyanik lekhan ko is baat se bada bal mila ki gurukul kangri ne vigyaan sahit sabhi vishyon kii shiksha ke liye hindi ko madhyam banaaya or tadnurup 17 pustakon kaa pranayan bhi kiya

, visited here and compulsorily to maintain the medium of English for the education of the College Department

 Traditionally, the literature of Kashmir was in Sanskrit
 neeche kashmir ke sanskrit ke pramukh sahityakaron ke naam diye gayi hai- The literature has been composed here for the last 800 years in the Kashmiri language and now in Urdu and Hindi as well
 kashmiri sahitya kaa pehla namoona "shithikanth" ke mahanayprakash kii "sarvagochar deshbhasha" main miltaa he
 Probably, the Shaiva Siddhas first made Kashmiri a popular medium of Shaivism and later gradually its folklore also took the form of writing
 par rashtriya or saanskrithik aashray se nirantar vanchit rahane ke kaaran isaki kshamtaaon kaa bharpoor vikaas dderghakal tak rukaa hi rahaa
 In any case, by the 14th century, the Kashmiri language had become a medium of folklore and folk culture in addition to colloquialism and when we find the language of lal-vakh more than the language of "banasuravadh", it is due to the dynamics of oral tradition itself
 Have to search kashmiri loksahitya main santawani, bhakthigit, aadhyatmagit, pranaygit, vivahageet, shramgit, kreedageet, ladishah, tathaa lokkathaayen vishesh rup se samrudh hai
 In the musical works called "sufiana Kalam", the tone of folklore is also heard
 vikascram kii drushti kashmiri sahitya ke paanch kaal maane ja sakate hai : In this period, the free speech of saints was predominant, in which the rendering and discourse of Shaivism, Tasavwuf, Sahajopasana, Virtue, Spirituality, Hypocrisy and Adoption were more, less sensitive expression
 is kaam kii rachanaaon main se shithikanth kaa mahanayprakash, kisi agyaat shaiva sant kaa chhumm sampradaay laladyad ke vaakh, nundaryo"sha ke shloke tathaa duusare ye"shon ke pad hi ab tak praapt ho sake hai
 In the first two of these, Kashmiri verses are tightly presented in Sanskrit frameworks; Yes, there are more Kashmiri "sutras" than Kashmiri verses found in the Chhumm sect which indicate definite use of folklore of Kashmiri language by Shaiva Siddhas
 is kaal kii itivrittapradhan rachanaaon main puranic tathaa loukik aakhyaanon ko kavy kaa aashray mila
 Particularly with the encouragement of Sultan zain-ul-abidin, some charities were written and musical works were also composed
 sultan ke jivan par aadhaarit ek khandakavy or ek drishykavy bhi rachaa gaya tha; par khed he, inamen se ab koi rachana uplabdh nahin
 Only Bannasuravadha of Bhattavatar is received, which is an independent composition, especially in the verses of the plan, based on Usha Anirudha's pranayagatha described in Harivamsa
 is kaal kii ek hi or rachana milti he; sultan ke pote hasanshaah ke darbari kavi ganak prashast kaa sukh-du:khacharit jisamen ashrayadata kii prashasti ke pashchaat jivan kii ritiniti kaa pratipaadan he
 The cosmopolitan depiction of Harshavishad of folk life is a captivating feature of this dynamic period
 iske "arth" or "iti" "ab" khatun or a"renimal hai jinke vednagiton main lokajeevan ke virah milan kaa vah karun madhur sargam sunai padataa he jo ek kaa hote hue bhi prayek kaa he
 Around 1600 AD, the tone of Sufi mysticism from this sargam also erupted in the songs and around 1650 AD, Lalakavya also emerged
 "sufiana kalam" kaa adhikansh isi kaal main rachaa hua jaan padataa he
 New experiments in the verses are also a special gift of this period
 is kaal main prabandh or pragit ke sangyojan se puranic pranaykavy or premamarga masanvi kavy paripusht hue
 On the one hand, poetic leelakavas were composed on lectures like Ramcharit, Krishnalila, Parvatiparinay, Damayanti Swayamvar, and on the other hand, in addition to the conversion of Persian masnavis, material was also taken from Arabic, Urdu and Punjabi premoderns; Along with this, some such religious songs were also composed in which there is a reflection of temporal and supernatural love as well as family affliction
 is kaal kii rachanaaon main vishesh ullekhneey ye hai-ramadan bat kaa aknandun; prakashram kaa raamaayan; mahmud gami ke shirin khusarav, laila majanun or usuf julekha; paramanand ke rada swayamvad, shevilagan or so"daamacharyath; valiullah mattu tathaa jarifashah kii sahakruti homaal; maqbool shah kralwari kii gulrej; azizullah hakkaani kii mumtaz benazir; krishna raazdaan kaa sha"valagan; tathaa l"khyayan bath nagam "bulbul" kaa naldaman
 During this period, the socio-cultural life of Kashmir also took the shape of modernity and influenced by the literary progress of other regions of India, poets here welcomed the new awakening
 dhire-dhire kashmiri kavita kaa rashtriya swar unchaa hota gaya or saamaajik tathaa saanskrithik jivan kii nai gatividhi kaa sajiv sangeet bhi goonj uthaa
 The Shahnama of Wahab Pare, the Gristyanama of Maqbool and Ghazal of Rasul Mir tied the antecedents of this awakening period, Mahjoor sang its glory and Azad gave new consciousness and made it an active ally of Indian literature of other regions
 uttarottar vikaas kii drushti se is aadhunik kaal ke chaar charan hai : In the first phase, the clichéd tradition of Sufi pedagogy created a slight alteration of humanism, and historical mosques also reflected the indirect depiction of its era
 duusare charan main deshbhakti kii bhaavana angadaa uthi or tisare main raajnneetik tathaa rashtriya chetana kaa nikhaar hua tathaa maanavvaad kaa swar unchaa hota gaya
 In the fourth phase, Kashmiri poetry took new turns
 pehle do varshon tak shatru ke pratirodh or nai aazaadee ke sangrakshan kii umang hi goonjati rahi
 After this, the establishment of economic democracy and the prestige of world peace began to be emphasized to fulfill the basic expectations of the creation of new Kashmir
 aise mahatvapurn vishyon par kavitaayen hi nahin, geetinaty or nritygit bhi rache gaye
 New experiments were also adopted to adopt the style of folklore and there was a tremendous change in the verses
 duusare charan main prakrutichitran kii jo pravriti jaag uthi thi vah us chauthe charan main ek nai kalaatmakataa ke anupranit hui or prakritik parivesh main saamaajik saanskrithik chithran kii ek sanshlisht style kaa vikaas hua
 "mahjoor" and "azad" followed by "master Ji", "arif", "nadim", "roshan", "rahi", "kami", "lover" and "almast" gave special sum in this direction
 aajkal "phiraaq", "chaman", "bekas", "aazim", "kundan", "saaqi" or "khyaal" vishesh saadhanashil hai
 "fazil", "ambardar" and "phani" are also making progress in their respective colors
 kashmiri gadhy patrakarita ke abhaav se viksit nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Although supporting drama and storytelling, plays, stories, talks and essays are being written; But unless there is a daily weekly of Kashmiri, the development of Kashmiri prose will remain doubtful
 phir bhi, likhanewaalon kii kami nahin he
 The storytellers include Akhtar Muhiuddin, Amin Kamil, Somnath Zutshi, Ali Muhammad Lone, Deepak Kaal, Avtakrishna Rahbar, Sufi Ghulam Muhammad, Hriday Kaul Bharti, Umesh Kaul and Banasi Innocent
 naatakakaron main "roshan", "jutshi", "lone", pushkar bhaan or "kamil" tathaa upanyaaskaaron main "akhtar", "lone" or "kamil" ke naam liye ja sakate hai
 If you get the facility of publication, twenty-two novels can be published
 kashmiri bhashaa ko skulon ke shikshakram main abhi samuchit sthaan nahin mil sakaa he
 This is a major obstacle in the proper development of Kashmiri language and literature

 Bedgaon is a village in Almora district of Kumaon division under the Uttarakhand state of India in Ranikhet tehsil
 ek bhartiya upnaam
 The history of Uttarakhand is legendary
 uttrakhand kaa shabdic arth uttari bhu bhaag kaa roopaantar he
 This name is mentioned in the early Hindu texts, where it is mentioned as Kedarkhand and Manaskhand
 uttrakhand pracheen puranic shabd bhi he jo himalay ke madhya failaav ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa tha
 Uttarakhand is also known as "dev Bhoomi" because this entire region is the playground of religious and divine beings and the key and mysterious essence of the origin and glories of Hinduism
 paurav, kushaan, gupt, katyuri, raayak, paal, chand, parmaar va payaal rajvansh or angrezon ne baari-baari se yahan shashan kiya tha
 Although according to the British historians, the Huns, Shakas, Nagas, Khashs etc
 also used to live in the Himalayan region, but in the mythological texts and history, the name of Kedarkhand and Manaskhand is widely known
 is kshetra ko dev-bhoomi va tapobhumi mana gaya he
 The names of Kurmanchal and Kumaon of Manaskhand became popular during the reign of Chand kings
 kurmaanchal par chand raajaaon kaa shashan katyuriyon ke baad prarambh hokar san 1790 tak rahaa
 In 1790, the Gorkha army of Nepal invaded Kumaon and subjugated the Kumaon kingdom
 gorkhaon kaa kumaanun par san 1790 se 1815 tak shashan rahaa
 After the last defeat of the British in 1815, the Gorkha army returned to Nepal, but the British did not give the rule of Kumaon to the Chand kings and made the Kumaon under the East India Company
 is prakaar kumaanun par angrejo kaa shashan 1815 se prarambh hua
 According to historical accounts, Kedar division was divided into several strongholds
 in gadhon ke alag raja the or raajaaon kaa apane-apane aadhipaty vaale kshetra par samrajya tha
 According to historians, the king of the Panwar dynasty subordinated these Garhos to establish a unified Garhwal kingdom and made Srinagar their capital
 kedarkhand kaa gadhwal naam tabhi prachlit hua
 In 1803, the Gorkha army of Nepal invaded Garhwal state and took over Garhwal state
 maharaja gadhwal ne nepal kii gorkha sena ke adhipaty se rajya ko mukt karaane ke liye angrajo se sahaayta maangi
 The British army finally defeated the Gorkha army of Nepal near Dehradun in 1815
 kintu gadhwal ke tatkaaleen maharaja dwaara yuddh vyay kii nirdhaarit dhanrashi kaa bhugtan karne main asamarthta vyakt karne ke kaaran angrajo ne sampoorn gadhwal rajya gadhwal ko na soup kar alakananda mandakini ke purv kaa bhaag east india company ke shashan main shaamil kar gadhwal ke maharaja ko keval tehri jile kaa bhu-bhaag vaapis kiya
 Sudarshan Shah, the then Maharaja of Garhwal, established his capital on 28 December 1815 at a place called Tehri which was a small village at the confluence of Bhagirathi and Milangana
 kuch varshon ke uparant unke uttaradhikari maharaja narendra shah ne orathali naamak sthaan par narendra nagar naam se duusari rajdhani sthapit kii
 From 1815, Dehradun and Paudi Garhwal came under the British and Tehri Garhwal came under Maharaja Tehri
 katyuri raja vir dev ke pashchaat katuriyon ke samrajya kaa purna vibhaajan ho gaya tathaa yah na keval apni jati ke apitu kuch bahari kabeelon ke bhi adheen bat gaya
 a large part of Garhwal passed out from the hands of Katyuris and the remaining Kumaon region was divided into six tribes
 tatpashchaat katuris samrajya ko nepali raajaaon ahokchala tathaa karachala dev ne apane rajya main mila liya
 Both these attacks proved decisive due to mutual enmity between different tribes
 tatpashchaat sampurna samrajya 64 athwa kuch maton ke anusaar 52 gadhon main vibhajit ho gaya
 The chieftains of all these strongholds often quarreled among themselves
 solahavi shatabdi ke prarambh main kanak paal ke vanshaj ajay paal ne jo kii chandpur gadhi kabeelon kaa sardaar tha, sampoorn gadhwal ko ek kar diya
 The copper plates of Pandukeshwar indicate that the capital of this barrage was located in the Karthikeyapura niti-mana valley and later in the Katyur valley
 atkinshan ne kabul kii ghati se is vanshaj kii utpatti kaa pataa lagaaya tathaa unakon kaatoron se joda
 According to Garoula and Nautiyal, the Katyuri was a small Khasa tribe who originally lived in Joshimath north of Garhwal and later migrated to the Katyur valley of Kumaon
 katuriyon ne pauravon or tibeti hamalaavaron ke patan ke baad apni takat badhaai tathaa 7 veen shatabdi ke ant or 8 veen shatabdi ke armbh main ve swatantra ho gaye
 In ancient Hindu texts, Kumaon was called Manaskhand
 oktober 1815 main dablyoo ji trail ne gadhwal tathaa kumaanun kamishnar kaa padbhaar sambhala
 He was followed by the commissioners of Batten, Baffett, Henry, Ramsay, Colonel Fisher, Combat, Pau, this division and he undertook land reforms, settlements, taxes, post and telegraph department, public health, law enforcement and dissemination of regional languages etc

 In a few decades, Garhwal gained a very important place in India and made its mark as the land of the brave castes
 landsdowne naamak sthaan par gadhwal sainikon kii 'gadhwal rifles' ke naam se do regiments sthapit kii gayi
 Undoubtedly, modern education and awareness helped Garhwalis to contribute greatly to the mainstream of India
 unhone aazaadee ke sangharsh tathaa anya saamaajik andolanon main bhaag liya
 After independence, Garhwal became a district of Uttar Pradesh in 1947 and in 2001, Uttarakhand became a district

 The name 'rajpur' has also been mentioned on many ancient copper plates
 ek puranic katha ke anisaar daksh prajapati kii putree uma kaa vivaah shiv se hua tha
 Daksha Prajapati did not like Shiva, but he could not defer the requests of the gods, so he did not want his daughter to marry Shiva
 ek baar daksh prajapati ne sabhi devataaon ko apane yahan yajna main bulaayaa, parantu apane damaad shiv or beti uma ko nimantran tak nahin diya
 Uma stubbornly reached this yagna
 jab usne haridwar sthit canarvan main apane pita ke yajna main sabhi devataaon kaa sammaan or apane pati or apni niraadar hote hue dekha to vah atyant du:khee ho gayi
 In the Havan Kund of the yagna, she jumped and said, "I will make Shiva my husband in the next life too
" apane meraa or mere pati kaa jo niraadar kiya iske pratifal - swarup yajna ke havan - kund main syvan jalakar aapke yajna ko asafal karti hoon
 'when Shiva came to know that Uma became Sati, his anger was no longer in the cross
 unhone apane ganon ke dwaara daksh prajapati ke yajna ko nasht - bhrasht kar daalaa
 All the Gods and Gods, seeing this insurmountable form of Shiva, started thinking that Shiva should not be destroyed
 isliye devi - devataaon ne mahadev shiv se prarthana kii or unke krodh ko shant kiya
 Daksha Prajapati also apologized
 shiv ne unako bhi aashirwad diya
 However, upon seeing Sati's burnt body, his quietness swelled
 unhone sati ke jaale hue sharir ko kandhe par daalkar akaash - bhraman karnaa shuru kar diya
 In such a situation, wherever the parts of the body fall, there the power returned
 jahaan par sati ke nayan gire the ; vahiin par nainadevi ke rup main uma arthath nanda devi kaa bhavy sthaan ho gaya
 Today's Nainital is the place where the Nain of that goddess fell
 nayanon kii ashrudhar ne yahan par taal kaa rup le liya
 Ever since then, Shivapathi Nanda is worshiped here as Nainadevi
 yahaan ke nikat ek gaanv main machhlee evam ghongho ke jeevashm paye gayi hai jisase ingit hota he ki pithauragarh kaa kshetra himalay ke nirmaan se pehle ek vishaal jhil rahaa hoga
 Until recently, Pithoragarh has been ruled by the Khas dynasty, who are credited with building forts or coats here
 pithauragarh ke aasapaasd chaar coten hai jo bhatkot, duungarkot, udaikot tathaa oonchakot hai
 After the Khas dynasty, the Kachudi dynasty ruled here and the king of this dynasty was Ashok Malla, a contemporary of Balban
 isi avadhi main raja pithora dwaara pithauragarh sthapit kiya gaya tathaa isi ke naam par pithauragarh naam bhi padaa
 Three kings of this dynasty ruled from Pithoragarh itself and the brick fort built by them in the nearby village of Khakot was demolished by the then Collector of Pithoragarh in the year 1560
 varsh 1622 se aage pithauragarh par chand vansh kaa aadhipaty rahaa
 There is another controversial description of the history of Pithoragarh
 atkins ke anusaar, chand vansh ke ek samant piru gosai ne pithauragarh kii sthapana kii
 It seems that during the reign of King Bharti Chand of the Chand dynasty, his son Ratna Chand defeated King Doti of Nepal and took control of the Solar Valley and in 1449 merged it with Kumaon or Kurmanchal
 usee ke shasankaal main piru yaa prithvi gosai ne pithauragarh naam se yahaan ek kila banaaya
 It was later named Pithoragarh after the fort itself
 chandon ne adhikansh kumaun par apana adhikaar vistrut kar liya jahaan unhone varsh 1790 tak shashan kiya
 He defeated many tribes and also fought with the neighboring kings so that their position would be strengthened
 varsh 1790 main, gorkhiyaali kahe jane vaale gorakhon ne kumaun par adhikaar jamaakar chand vansh kaa shashan samaapt kar diya
 The exploitation of the Gorkha rulers came to an end in the year 1815 when the East India Company defeated them and established their suzerainty over Kumaon
 atkins ke anusaar, varsh 1881 main pithauragarh kii kul jansankhya 552 thi
 During the British era there was a military cantonment, a church and a mission school
 is kshetra main chrishchiyan mishanri bahut sakriy the
 Till 1960, Pithoragarh was a tehsil of Almora district with the preponderance of the British, after which it became a district
 varsh 1997 main pithauragarh ke kuch bhaagon ko katkar ek nayaa jila champavat banaaya gaya tathaa isaki seemaa ko punarnirdhaarit kar diya gaya
 In the year 2000, Pithoragarh became a part of the new state of Uttarakhand
