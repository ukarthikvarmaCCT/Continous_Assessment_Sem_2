 In 2014, writer-director Vikramaditya Motwani met the Netflix team during his visit to Los Angeles

 "motwani then began working on an adaptation of the novel with writer Varun Grover, and described the writing as" the biggest challenge "
 motwani ne kaha ki digital shrunkhlaa kaa madhyam unke liye "mukti dene vaala" tha, kyonki ab vah un kahaniyon ko bhi bataane main sakasham the, jinhen ki "dhai ghante ke antaraal main, or teen gane daalane ke baad bataaya janaa jaruri nahin tha
 "initially Motwani's idea was to employ different directors for each episode, but as they got closer to the production process, they found that it was quite difficult for all directors to find different dates

 Nath said that at the beginning of the writing process they were "taking away some important characters from the original, and bringing in new ones
 " puraa kathanak ek saal main purna ho gaya tha
 After the writing process was completed, Motwani and other writers gave the script to Chandra for feedback because according to him "chandra is such a research-intensive person that he did not have to contact any other researcher

 isai dharm kii duusari mukhya shakha protestant kehalaati he or uske anuyaayi pope ke dharmik netritv ko nahin sweekaarte

 The original meaning of Kathlik is broad
 katholic carch kaa daawa he ki vah yugaugantar tak arthath 'sab samay' 'sabhi deshon' ke manushyon ke liye khulaa rahata he or isa dwaara prakat kii gai 'sabhi' dharmik sachchaaiyaan sikhalaataa he

 yah gaur-talab baat he ki yadhyapi "carch" shabd kaa arth "girizaa" hota he, "catholic carch" kaa arth "sampoorn catholic dharmik samudaay" bhi hota he
 Catholics believe that their religious organization continues the custom of the early Christian organization and is its sole heir

 Due to the promise given to his father, he took a vow of lifelong celibacy
 inhen ichhamrityu kaa vardaan praapt tha
 Once Hastinapur King Dushyant went to play forest
 jis van main ve shikaar ke liye gayi the usee van main kanv rishi kaa ashram tha
 Maharaj Dushyant reached his ashram to see Kanva Rishi
 pukaar lagane par ek ati lavanyamayi kanya ne ashram se nikal kar kaha, “he rajan! maharishi to tirth yatra par gayi hai, kintu aapkaa is ashram main swaagat he
 Seeing that girl, Maharaj Dushyant asked, "child! Who are you?" The girl said, "my name is Shakuntala and i am the daughter of Kanva Rishi
 ” us kanya kii baat sun kar maharaj dushyant aashcharyachakit hokar bole, “maharishi to aajanm brahmacharee hai phir aap unki putree kaise hain?” unke is prashn ke uttar main shakuntala ne kaha, “vastav main mere mata-pita menka or vishwamitra hai
 My mother left me in the forest when i was born, where a bird named Shakunta protected me
 isi liye meraa naam shakuntala padaa
 After that the sight of Kanva Rishi fell upon me and he brought me to his ashram
 unhone hi meraa bharan-poshan kiya
 One who gives birth, one who gives nourishment and one who gives food - all three are called fathers
 is prakaar kanv rishi mere pita huye
 " shakuntala ke vachanon ko sunakar maharaj dushyant ne kaha, “shakuntale! tum kshatriya kanya ho
 Seeing your beauty, i have given my heart to you
 yadi tumhen kisi prakaar kii aapatti na ho to main tumse vivaah karnaa chahta hoon
 "shakuntala was also fascinated with King Dushyant, so he gave his approval
 donon nen gandharv vivaah kar liya
 Maharaja Dushyant spent some time in the forest, while staying with Shakuntala
 phir ek din ve shakuntala se bole, “priytame! mujhe ab apana rajkaarya dekhne ke liye hastinapur prasthaan karnaa hoga
 When Maharishi Kanva returns from his pilgrimage, i will take you away from here and take you to my palace
 ” itnaa kahkar maharaj ne shakuntala ko apane prem ke pratik ke rup main apni swarna mudrika di or hastinapur chale gayi
 One day Durvasa Rishi came to his ashram
 maharaj dushyant ke virah main leen hone ke kaaran shakuntala ko unke aagaman kaa gyaan bhi nahin hua or usne durvasa rishi kaa yathochit swaagat satkar nahin kiya
 Durvasa Rishi considered it his insult and in anger said, "balike! i curse you that anyone you have humiliated me, will forget you
 ” durvasa rishi ke shaap ko sun kar shakuntala kaa dhyaan tutaa or vah unke charnon main gir kar kshamaa prarthana karne lagi
 Surprised by Shakuntala's pardon prayer, Durvasa Rishi said, "if you have a love sign with him, then you will be reminded of that sign
 ” Shakuntala became pregnant due to Maharaj Dushyant's cohabitation
 kuch kaal pashchaat kanv rishi tirth yatra se laute tab shakuntala ne unhen maharaj dushyant ke saath apane gandharv vivaah ke vishay main bataaya
 Maharishi Kanva said, "daughter!" It is not appropriate for a married girl to stay in the father's house
 ab tere pati kaa ghar hi tera ghar he
 After saying this, the Maharishi sent Shakuntala with his disciples to Hastinapur
 maarg main ek sarovar main aachman karte samay maharaj dushyant kii di hui shakuntala kii anguthi, jo ki prem chinh thi, sarovar main hi gir gai
 a fish swallowed that ring
 maharaj dushyant ke paas pahunch kar kanv rishi ke shishyon ne shakuntala ko unke saamne khadi kar ke kaha, “maharaj! shakuntala aapaki patni he, aap ise sweekaar karen
 Maharaj had forgotten Shakuntala because of the curse of Durvasa Rishi
 atah unhone shakuntala ko sweekaar nahin kiya or us par kulata hone kaa laanchhan lagane lage
 As soon as Shakuntala was insulted, lightning flashed in the sky and her mother Maneka took her away in front of everyone
 jis machhlee ne shakuntala kii anguthi ko nigal liya tha, ek din vah ek machuaare ke jaal main aa fasi
 When the fisherman bit him, a ring came out of his stomach
 machuaare ne us anguthi ko maharaj dushyant ke paas bhent ke rup main bhej diya
 On seeing the ring, Maharaj remembered Shakuntala and repented of his act
 maharaj ne shakuntala ko bahut dhundhvaya kintu uskaa pataa nahin chalaa
 After a few days, after receiving the invitation of Devraj Indra, Maharaj Dushyant went to Indravati's city Amravati to help him in the Devasur struggle
 sangram main vijay praapt karne ke pashchaat jab ve akaash maarg se hastinapur laut rahe the to maarg main unhen kashyap rishi kaa ashram drushtigat hua
 They stayed there for their visions
 ashram main ek sundar balak ek bhayankar singh ke saath khel rahaa tha
 Maneka had left Shakuntala with the sage Kashyapa and that child was the son of Shakuntala
 us balak ko dekh kar maharaj ke hriday main prem kii bhaavana umad padi
 When he proceeded to lift her in the lap, Shakuntala's friend shouted, "O gentle man! You should not touch this child, otherwise a black dora tied in his arm will bite you
 ” yah sun kar bhi dushyant swayan ko na roak sake or balak ko apane god main uthaa liya
 Now Sakhi saw with surprise that the black goat tied in the child's arm has fallen on the earth
 sakhi ko gyaat tha ki balak ko jab kabhi bhi uskaa pita apane god main legaa vah kaala doraa prithvi par gir jaayegaa
 Sakhi was happy and narrated the entire story to Shakuntala
 shakuntala maharaj dushyant ke paas ai
 Maharaj recognized Shakuntala
 unhone apane krity ke liye shakuntala se kshamaa prarthana kiya or kashyap rishi kii ajna lekar use apane putr sahit apane saath hastinapur le aaye
 The name of Maharaja Dushyant and that son of Shakuntala was Bharata

 It is said that once a demon named 'vritrasura' took control of Indraloka and drove the gods including Indra out of heaven
 sabhi devtaa apni vyathaa lekar brahma, vishnu va mahesh ke paas gaye, lekin koi bhi unki samasya kaa nidaan na kar sakaa
 Later Brahma Ji told the gods a remedy that a Maharishi named 'dadhichi' lives in the earth
 yadi ve apni asthiyon kaa daan kar den to un asthiyon se ek vajra banaaya jaye
 With that thunderbolt Vritrasura can be killed, because Vritrasura cannot be killed by any weapon
 maharishi dadhichi kii asthiyon main hi vah brahm tej he, jisase vritrasur rakshas maaraa ja saktaa he
 There is no other way apart
 indra kaa sankoch Devraj Indra did not want to go to Maharishi Dadhichi, because Indra once insulted Dadhichi, due to which he was reluctant to go to Dadhichi
 mana jaataa he ki brahm vidya kaa gyaan puure vishwa main keval maharishi dadhichi ko hi tha
 Maharshi wanted to give knowledge of this knowledge to only specific person, but Indra was very keen to get Brahman knowledge
 dadhichi kii drushti main indra is vidya ke paatr nahin the
 Therefore he refused to give this knowledge to Indra
 dadhichi ke inkaar karne par indra ne unhen kisi anya ko bhi yah vidya dene ko manaa kar diya or kaha ki- "yadi aapane aisa kiya to main aapkaa sir dhad se alag kar doongaa"
 The Maharishi said that- "if he finds a qualified person, he will definitely give him theology
" " kuch samay baad indralok se hi ashvinikumar maharishi dadhichi ke paas brahm vidya lene pahunche
 Dadhichi found Ashwinikumar eligible for Brahman learning
 unhone ashvinikumaron ko indra dwaara kahi gai baaten bataayin
 Then Ashvinikumar attained Brahmanism by putting the head of Maharishi Dadhichi's horse
 indra ko jab yah jaankaree mili to vah prithvi lok main aaye or apni ghoshnaa ke anusaar maharishi dadhichi kaa sir dhad se alag kar diya
 The Ashvinikumaras retook Maharishi's real head
 indra ne ashvinikumaron ko indralok se nikaal diya
 This was the reason that now Indra did not want to come to Maharishi Dadhichi to ask for donation of his ashes
 ve is kaary ke liye bada hi sankoch mahasoos kar rahe the
 Donation of bones by Dadhichi devloak par vritrasur rakshas ke atyaachaar din-pratidin badhate hi ja rahe the
 He was disturbing the gods very much
 antatah devraj indra ko indralok kii raksha va devataaon kii bhalaai ke liye or apane singhaasana ko bachaane ke liye devataaon sahit maharishi dadhichi kii sharan main janaa hi padaa
 Maharishi Dadhichi paid full respect to Indra and asked the reason for coming to the ashram
 indra ne maharishi ko apni vyathaa sunai to dadhichi ne kaha ki- "main devloak kii raksha ke liye kya kar saktaa hoon
 "the gods told him the things that happened to Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh and asked for donations of their ashes
 maharishi dadhichi ne bina kisi hichkichaahat ke apni asthiyon kaa daan dena sweekaar kar liya
 He set up a tomb and gave up his body
 us samay unki patni ashram main nahin thi
 Now the problem came before the Gods, who should remove the flesh of Maharishi Dadhichi's body
 is kaary ke dhyaan main aate hi sabhi devtaa saham gaye
 Then Indra called Kamadhenu the cow and asked him to remove the flesh from the body of Maharishi
 kamdhenu ne apni jeebh se chaat-chatkar maharishi ke sharir kaa maans utaar diya
 Now only the cage of bones was left
 gabhastini kii jid Maharishi Dadhichi gave up his body for the good of the gods, but when his wife 'ghabhastini' came back to the ashram, seeing her husband's body, she started mourning and insisting on being Sati
 tab devataao ne unhen bahut manaa kiya, kyonki vah garbhvatee thi
 The gods advised him not to have sati for his dynasty
 lekin gabhastini nahin maani
 Then everyone requested them to hand over their wombs to the gods
 is par gabhastini raji ho gai or apana garbh devataaon ko saunpkar swayan sati ho gai
 In order to save the womb of the goddess, the Gods entrusted Peepal to take care of him
 kuch samay baad vah garbh palakar shishu hua to pipal dwaara paalan poshan karne ke kaaran uskaa naam 'pippalad' rakhaa gaya
 For this reason, the descendants of Dadhichi are called 'dadhich'

 vidarbha desh kii amravati nagari jo ki sabhi sukhon se paripurna thi vahaan padhaare
 vahaan ke raja dwaara ek atyant sundar shiv mandir tha, jahaan ve rahane lage
 Once Parvati ji desired to disturb Chaucer
 tabhi mandir main pujari ke pravesh karanbe par mataji ne poocha ki is baazi main kiski jeet hogi? to brahman ne kaha ki mahadev ji kii
 But Parvati ji won
 tab brahman ko unhone jhooth bolne ke aparaadh main kodhi hone kaa shraap diya
 After several days, Devlok's Apsaras, entered the temple and seeing him, asked the reason
 The priest said everything without any hesitation
 tab apsaraon ne dhants bandhaaya or solah somvaar ke vratra rakhane ko bataaya
 On asking the method, he also explained the method as mentioned above
 With this, all wishes are fulfilled by the grace of Shiva
 fir apsaraayein swarg ko chalin gayin
 The Brahmin fasted on Mondays and spent his life free from disease
 kuch din uparaant shiv parvati ji ke padhaarney par, parvati ji ne uske rogamukt hone kaa karan poocha
 tab brahman ne sari katha bataayi
 tab parvati ji ne bhi yahi vrath kiya or unki manokamana purna hui
 His wrathful son Karthikeya was obedient to his mother
 But Karthikeya ji asked the reason for his change of mind
 Then Parvati ji told the same story to him as well
 Then Swami Karthikeya Ji also observed the same fast
 unki bhi ichha purna hui
 His friend Brahmin asked him to do the same fast
 fir vah brahman videsh gaya or ek raaj ke yahaan swayamvar main gaya
 There the king pledged that a rosary would put a garland around whose neck he would marry his daughter

 The king married her daughter to him
 us kanya ke poochne par brahman ne use katha bataayi
 tab us kanya ne bhi vahi vrath kar ek sundar putr paaya
 Later that son also did the same fast and got the kingdom of an old king
 jab vah nayaa raja somvaar kii puja karne gaya, to uski patni ashraddha hone se nahin gayi
 At the end of the worship, Akash uttered that Rajan should leave this girl, otherwise your apocalypse may die
 Finally he expelled the queen from the kingdom
 vah rani bhukhi pyaasi roti hui duusare nagar main pahunchi
 vahaan ek budhiya use mili, jiske saath vah He found an old woman who made threads
 usee ke saath kaam karne lagi par dusre din jab wo dhaagaa bechney nikali to achaanak tej hawa chali or saare dhaage ud gaye to malkin ne gusse main aakar use kamse nikaal diya
 Then she reached the house of a Teli while weeping, she kept it but when she went to the treasury house, the oil pots fell and if the oil ran out, she threw it out of the house
 is prakaar sabhi jagah se nikaale jane ke baad vah ek sundar van me pahaunchi vahaan ke talab se pani pine ke liye jab badhi to talab sukh gaya thoda pani bachaa jo ki kito se yukt tha
 Drinking the same water, she sat under a tree, but immediately the leaves of that tree fell
 is tarah wo jis vriksh ke neeche se guzarati vah vriksh patto se viheen ho jaataa aise hi sara van hi sukhane ko aayaa
 Seeing this, some shepherds took the queen to a Shiva temple priest
 vahaan ranine pujari ke aagrah se sari baat bataayi or sun kar pujari ne kaha kii tumhe shiv kaa shraap laga he
 When the queen begged, the priest told her the remedy for its diagnosis and told about the Monday fast
 rani ne tan man se vrath puraa kiya or shiv kii kripa se satrahave somvaar ko raja kaa man parivartan hua
 The king sent messengers to find the queen
 pataa lagane ke baad raja ne bulaava bheja par pujari ne kaha raja ko swayan bhejo
 The king thought on this and reached himself
 rani ko lekar darvaar pahuche or unka sthaan diya
 The whole city was celebrated with happiness, the king offered alms to the poor and as a devotee of Shiva, started fasting on Monday for 16 Monday and after going through all the happiness of the world went to Shivdham

 This is called rain
 vaayu main mila jalawaashp sheethal padaarthon ke sampark main aane se sanghanan ke kaaran osank tak pahunchataa he
 When the temperature of the air falls below the dew point, then the water vapor starts falling on the surface in the form of water droplets or hail
 isi ko varsha kehete hai
 At any place, the amount of water received from the rainbows and snowflakes at a given time is called the measurement of rainfall there
 garmi ke kaaran utpann jalawaashp upar akaash main jaakar failata he evam thanda hota he
 Therefore, as the air rises, its ability to hold water vapor decreases
 yahan tak ki adhik upar uthne se vaayu kaa taap us ank tak pahunch jaataa he, jahaan vaayu jalawaashp dhaaran kar sakati he
 At even lower temperatures, the water vapor gets converted into watercourses
 isi se badalon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Then clouds rain down on the surface due to water
 jalakan banane ke uparaant bhi yadi vaayu kaa taap kam hote hote himank se bhi kam ho jaataa he, to jalakan himakanon kaa rup dhaaran kar lete hai jisase himavarsha hoti he

 The air cools up and spreads
 vaashp kii maatra adhik hone se osank tak pahunchane ke liye taap ko kam girnaa padataa he
 Hence, the vapor quickly takes the form of water and there is pouring rain usually after two o'clock every day
 is varsha ko sanvahneey varsha kehete hai
 When winds are blocked in the path of steam-laden winds, these winds have to rise, due to the effect of frozen snow on the mountains and as the air is cooled by the spread of air, the air vapor comes in the form of droplets on the ground
 ye hawaayen parvat ke duusari ore maidan main utarate hi garam ho jaati hai or aasapaas ke vaataavaran ko bhi garam kar detii he
 Similar rainfall occurs in most parts of the world

 is prakaar kii varsha garam or sheethal vayurasiyon ke aapas main milane se hoti he, kyonki halki garam vaayu upar uthati he tathaa baari sheethal vaayu neeche baithti he
 Therefore, the air rising up becomes cold and starts raining
 is prakaar varsha praaia: shitoshna katibandh main hua karti he
 An instrument is used to measure how much rainfall has occurred in a place, which is called a rainbow

 The specialty of his teachings as a religion theology is that he is associated with a divine principle of introvert and love devotion and socially he is associated with an egalitarian principle which is against the caste and practice of Hinduism and Hinduism It is also against the difference of Muslim

 'sant Mat' means 'the path of saints', 'the path of truth', 'the path of right and optimism' or 'opinion of saints'
 The word 'saint' is derived from the Sanskrit metal 'sad' and is used in many ways
 Its original meaning is' one who knows the truth 'or' one who has experienced the ultimate truth
 ' 'sant' shabd se arth aam taur par ek achche vyakti se liya jaataa he lekin iskaa vishesh arth madhyakaalin bharat ke sant kaviyon se hi liya jaataa he
 The Sant Mat movement was not uniform and involved its own socio-religious behavior of saints which was based on the devotion described in the Bhagavad Gita a thousand years ago
 unki apni sajhi kuch roodhiyaan aapas main or un paramparaon ke anuyaayion main bhi sajhi thim jinhen unhone chunauti di thi
 Thus, the saint opinion seems to be such a diverse group of spiritual personalities rather than a specific religious tradition that accepts a common spiritual origin
 is andolan kii seemayen sambhavat: sampradaiwaadee nahin thim or isamen jati or puja-paddati kii brahman avadharanaayen bhi nahin thim
 The saint poets wrote their speech in spoken language which they addressed to the common people in local languages like Hindi and Marathi
 unhone ishwar naam ko sachcha rakshak kaha or dharmik aadambaron ko moolyaheen kah kar khaarij kar diya
 He established the idea that religion is a matter of devotion to God that dwells in the heart

 According to the Sant Mat tradition, Ramananda was a Vaishnava monk who donated names to Kabir, Ravidas and other saints
 ramanandi bhikshuon kii parampara, uske baad ke anya sant or baad ke sikhon dwaara ramanand kii katha ko alag-alag tarah se bataata he
 There is so much information that Ramanand accepted disciples from all castes, a fact which was opposed by orthodox Hindus at that time
 sant mat ke anuyaayi maanate hai ki ramanand ke shishyon ne santon kii pehali peedi taiyaar kii
 These saints developed a culture that was close to the marginalized human beings in the society, which included women, Dalits, untouchables and the extreme
 kuch adhik prasiddh santon main namdev, kabir, nanak, surdaas, mira bai, tulsidas or tukaraam shaamil hai
 
 santon kii panrapara gaiyr-sampradaiwaadee rahi yadhyapi mana jaataa he ki kai sant kaviyon ne apane sampradaay sthapit kiye
 Many of these have saints associated with their names, but their disciples later carried on cults like Kabir Panth, Dadu Panth, Dariya Panth, Advaita Matha, Science of Spirituality and Radhaswamy
 dharmik hinduon ke ek alp samudaay ne hi aupchaarik rup se sant mat kaa anugaman kiya he
 But this tradition has a great impact on all sects and castes
 mira bai jaise beete santon ke bhajan ko bharat or vishwa bhar main hindu jatiyon main kaaphi suna jaataa he
 Medieval and modern Bharata is the only saintly tradition that has successfully broken Hindu and Muslim boundaries
 julius je
 lipnor ne jor de kar kaha he ki santon kii dharmik shikshaaon ne kai hinduon ke jivan kaa utthan kiya he or usne use swatantraadaayini kaha he
 In the Sant Mat tradition, importance is given to the living Guru, which is addressed with respectful words like Satguru or 'purna Guru'
 mana jaataa he ki madhyakaalin sufi kaviyon yatha jalaal al-deen mohammad rumi or sindhi kaviyon or sant mat kaviyon ke bich bahut samanta he
 The Radhaswami movement of North India considers itself to be the main endowment of saintly tradition and religious endeavor and presents itself as a living embodiment of the saintly tradition
 sabase adhik ullekhneey radhaswami satsang beas he, jo beas nadi ke kinare par sthit he or jiske vartmaan jivit guru gurinder singh hai
 According to Mark Jürgansmeyer, such a claim is also made by Kabir Panthi, Sikhs and other movements who are gaining insights from today's legitimate Sant Mat tradition
