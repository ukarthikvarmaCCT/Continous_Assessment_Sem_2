 The Tasmanian devil is a carnivorous marsupial that is now found only in the jungles of Australia's island state of Tasmania

 After the extinction of Thylacine in 1936, it became the world's largest carnivore Dhaniprani

 Although it is usually solitary, it sometimes eats with other devils and defecates in the collective
 apane kul kii adhikansh jatiyon ke vipareet, divil prabhavi dhang se tapaniyantran karne main sakasham he or din ke madhya main bahut garm hue bina sakriy rahata he
 Despite its round shape, the devil has amazing speed and endurance
 yah ped par chadh saktaa hai or tair kar nadi paar kar saktaa he
 The ancient Dhanipranis are believed to have migrated to Australia in the modern-day area of the Gondwana continent tens of millions of years ago and migrated to Australia and developed as they dried up

 Wild dogs are commonly blamed for this omission, which is not present in Tasmania
 kyonki unhen tasmania main basane vaale europea mul ke logon ne pashudhan or manushya dwaara khaal ke liye lakshith jaanwaron ke liye khatare ke rup main dekha gaya, isliye unka shikaar kiya jane laga or ve luptpraaya ho gaye

 Programs are currently underway to reduce the impact of the disease, including the initiative by the Government of Tasmania to form a group of healthy devils in a separate protection from the disease

 The collision of motor vehicles on the road is also severely reducing the devil's local population, especially when they are eating carcasses of dead animals on the road

 The naturalist George Harris wrote the first published description of the Tasmanian devil in 1807 and named it Didelphis ursina, which literally means "meat-eating bear" because of its round-eared bear-like characteristics
 He previously made a presentation on the subject at the London Zoological Society

 The typical ancestry of the Tasmanian devil is thought to have emerged in principle in the Middle Ages — according to molecular evidence that the Quoll ancestors split between one and a half million years ago — when Australia experienced severe climate changes, a hot and humid climate, a waterless, In the dry ice age, metamorphism occurred, resulting in mass extinction

 It has been speculated that the Devil's lineage may have been raised at this time as a scavenger in the ecosystem, to wipe out the corpses left behind by selectively eaten thylacines
 Glucodone baleratensis of the Old Age has been described as an intermediate species of quoll and devil

 Since the extinction of these two species came at a time when human populations were settling in Australia, human hunting and simultaneous deforestation have been cited as possible reasons

 They also point out that these caves inhabited by the original devil have a very small proportion of bones and sculptures of the devil, indicating that this was not a large part of their original lifestyle

 Since the devil is the closest relative to thylacine, it has been speculated that thylacine could be regenerated by combining DNA from the thylacine specimens housed in the museum with the devil's egg

 yah mana jaataa he ki kyonki ek surakshit maand beshkeemtee hoti he, kuch kaa shatabdiyon ke liye jaanwaron kii kai pidiyon dwaara prayog kiya gaya ho saktaa he
 Studies have suggested that food security is less important than den protection, because the greater dominance of habitat destruction is the protection of mortality at lower mortality rates, as is the effect of habitat destruction that has more of the latter
 The small puppies live with their mothers in their den and other devils move, changing the den every 1-3 days and traveling an average of 8
6 km each night

 Drumayuca is a clan of Hemiptera gana of the insect class

 Therefore, they reduce the growth of plants, as well as fruits etc

 Both male and female children are produced during the hemat season

 These eggs originate in the female drumuka in Vasantrutu by spending the winter, which are mostly featherless

 If there were no birds, spiders, philanthropists and birbhutis, the production of Drumayuca would have increased so much that possibly the entire plant would have been destroyed

 Drumayukas are very gourmet and suck the juice of the plant so quickly and in excess that most of the juice comes out of the body in the unchanged state

 This sugary fluid is called honey-juice

 In the winter, ants take care of their eggs and in the spring and summer, take their children from their mouths and take them inside the ground and establish them on the roots of grain and grass etc
, so that the Drumayukas can get their food

 Scholars differ on the origin of Khakas
 kuch ke anusaar yah kirghiz logon ke vanshaj hai jo kabhi yenicey nadi ke kshetra main rahete the or jinke anya vanshaj aadhunik kirgizstan main basate hai
 In the 17th century, the Khakas maintained their own Khakasia kingdom under a Mongol ruler

 In the 1820s, gold was found from the ground near the city of Minusinsk in Krasnoyarsk Krai and industrialization of the entire region began

 Russian forces also forced many Khakas to make Russian traditional Christians, but till date Khakas society mixes elements of Ojha religion and Buddhism and many Khakas believe in the mixture of Christian exorcism and Christianity

 Rahul is the elder son and was adopted by Yash and Nandini at birth
 yah rohan ko chhodkar rychand ke ghar main har kisi ko pataa he
 Raichand's house follows traditions
 bade hone par rahul jeevant anjali sharma se miltaa hai or antat ve pyaar main padate hai
 But their love is denied, as Anjali comes from a low-income background
 yash or nandini jald hi rohan ko boarding skool bhejte hai jo unke parivaar ke sabhi purushon ne kiya he
 Yash declares Rahul his wish to marry Naina
 lekin naina jaan jaati he ki rahul anjali se pyaar karata he or use uske paas jane ke liye protsaahit karti he
 When Yash comes to know about this, he is angry
 rahul anjali se shaadi na karne kaa vaada karata he
 On his way to tell his promise, he discovers that his father has died and decides to marry him despite his father's refusal

 Rohan urges Rahul to come home, but Rahul refuses

 Therefore, the whole family attends the funeral

 The Mawflang Assembly Constituency is an assembly constituency in the Indian state of Meghalaya
 yahan se vartmaan vidhayak cinter class sunn hai
 Following is the list of mlas from this constituency - kisi bhugolic kshetra yaa jan samooh par satta yaa prabhutv ke sampoorn niyantran par anany adhikaar ko samprabhutaa kaha jaataa he
 The sovereign is the highest lawmaker and controller, that is, sovereignty is the supreme power of the state
 europe main aadhunik rajya ke udai ke parinamswaroop satrahavin sadi main 'samprabhutaa' kii avadharana kaa janm hua
 In European Europe, the power in European kingdoms and empires was divided between the king, the pope and the feudal lords
 pandrahavin or solahavin sadi main samantvaad ke tirohit hone or udhar protestant mat ke ubhaar ke kaaran catholic carch kii manyata main hraas hone se samprabhu rajyon ko panpane kaa mauka mila
 Sovereignty means 'total and unlimited power'
 lekin iske nihitarth itane sahaj nahin hai
 Just by this meaning it is not known what is involved in the structure of this entire power
 Does it mean any supreme statutory authority or is it related to a political power that cannot be challenged? samprabhutaa ke arth sambandhi isi tarah ke vivaadon ke kaaran unnisvin sadi se hi ise do bhaagon main baant kar samajha jaataa rahaa he : vidhik samprabhutaa or raajnneetik samprabhutaa
 This concept is also practically accepted as internal sovereignty and external sovereignty
 samprabhutaa ke aantarik sanskaran kaa matlab he rajya ke bheetar hone vaale satta ke bantwaare main yani raajnneetik pranali ke bheetar sarvocch satta kaa mukaam
 External version refers to the ability of the state to remain active as an independent and autonomous entity under the international system
 samprabhutaa kii avadharana aadhunik raashtra or rashtrawaad ke aadhaar main bhi nihit he
 Without the mixed influence of ideas of national independence, self-rule and sovereignty, one cannot imagine the process of de-colonization under which new nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America grew up largely after World War II
 Was created vidhik or raajnneetik samprabhutaa ke bich antar kaa ek bauddhik itihaas he jise samajhane ke liye jyaan bodaan or thomas hobbs ke tatsambandhit matbhedon par nazar daalani hogi
 Bodan, in his work The Six Books of Commonwealth, argues in favor of a sovereign who makes laws himself, but places himself above those laws
 is vichaar ke mutabik kanoon kaa arth he logon ko samprabhu ke aadesh par chalaanaa
 This does not mean that Boda wanted to advocate an autocratic ruler here
 unki manyata thi ki kanoon banane or unka anupaalan karaane vaala samprabhu shaasha ek ucchtar kanoon ke adheen rahegaa
 That is, the seal of divine law will be necessary on the authority of the temporal ruler
 bodaan ke is vichaar ke vipareet hobbs apni rachana levaythan main samprabhutaa ke vichaar kii vyakhya praadhikaar ke sandarbh main na karke satta ke sandarbh main karte hai
 Prior to Hobbes, St
 Augustine stressed the need for a sovereign who would control the moral evils inherent in humanity
 isi tark kaa or vikaas karte hue hobbs ne samprabhutaa ko damankaaree satta par ekadhikaar ke rup main paribhaashit karte hue sifaarish kii ki yah takat akele shaasha ke haath main honi chahie
 Although Hobbes preferred uninterrupted monarchy, he was also willing to believe that it could be in the hands of a small faction of rulers or a democratic assembly
 bodaan or hobbs ke bich kii yah bahes bataati he ki vidhik samprabhutaa rajya ke kanoon ko sarvopari maanane par tiki hui he
 In contrast, political sovereignty is linked to the actual distribution of power
 is fark ke baavjood yah bhi maananaa padegaa ki samprabhutaa kii vyaavhaarik dharna main vidhik pahalu bhi hote hai or raajnneetik bhi
 The sovereignty of modern states is also dependent on the supremacy of the law and on the power system that complies with the law, which has a repressive machinery
 koi bhi kanoon mahaz naitik baadhyataaon ke dam par lagu nahin hota
 It cannot be sustained without a system of punishment, police, jails and courts
 vidhik or raajnneetik samprabhutaa kaa yah sameekaran donon taraf se kargar hota dikhaai detaa he
 If the law requires a system of power for its compliance, then the power requires the recommendation of the law for its legitimacy
 shashan ko kanoonsammat or samvidhansammat hona padataa he, tabhi uski vaidhata kaayam rah paati he
 Only dictatorial governments work on the basis of political sovereignty
 agar sarkaar loktantric he to uski damankaaree mashinari ko kanoon kii simaaon main rah kar adaalaton ke sammukh javabdeh rahanaa padataa he
 The question of the internal nature of sovereignty has been much debated in the realm of political theory
 akhir sarvocch or aseemit satta kaa mukaam kya hona chahie? kya use kisi ek shaasha ke haath main rakhaa janaa shreyaskar hoga yaa uskaa centre kisi pratinidhitvamoolak sanstha main nihit hona behatar hoga? satrahavin sadi main frans ke samraat lui chaudaaven ne darp se kaha tha ki main hi rajya hoon
 The rationale behind giving sovereignty in the hands of a person is that in that case sovereignty will be guaranteed to be inseparable
 uski abhivyakti ek hi awaz main hogi or usamen koi doosraa praadhikaar hastkshep nahin kar paayegaa
 Effective interference in this totalitarian notion of sovereignty was done in the eighteenth century when jean-jacques Rousseau introduced the concept of popular sovereignty
 ruso ne rajshahi kii hukumat ko kaarij karte hue apni rachana soshal kantrect main likhaa : ‘manushya swatantra paidaa hota he, par har jagah vah zanjiron main jakadaaa hua he
 In fact, the social contract gives a new form to modern political philosophy
 unka saamaajik samjhauta hobbs or lock ke saamaajik samjhaute se alag he
 Philosophers prior to Rousseau believed that humans are different from other beings because of their intellectual abilities, while Rousseau believes that humans are different because of their ability to make moral choices
 agar use yah chunaav karne kii azaadi na di jaae to vah das se adhik kuch nahin rah jayega
 Since society is full of various freedoms, and man cannot return to the early world of his natural freedom, Rousseau suggests that he should exchange that freedom with civil liberties
 iske liye manushya ko ek-duusare se mil kar sanghathan bananaa hoga, saamaajik astitv rachana hoga jiske tahat sabhi log apane adhikaar tyaag denge or badale main naagarik ke rup main adhikaar praapt karenge, ek samprabhu ke sadsy ke rup main rahenge
 That is, a constitution will have to be made, under which every person will be subject and also a participating citizen
 keval isi tarah swatantraaa kii guarantee kii ja sakegi
 This was the concept of democracy, but the Russo did not agree with democracy or law-making run by the representatives of the people
 pracheen yunaan ke pratyaksh loktantr kii tarah ruso chaahate the ki sabhi naagarik ek saarvajanik sthaan par jamaa ho kar vidhi nirmaan karen
 To save the minority from being subject to the decision taken by the majority, Rousseau favored a consensus which formulated his most well-known principle 'public will' to make it effective
 ‘jan-ichha’ ke aadhaar par rache gayi kanoon ke paalan kaa matlab tha swayan apni ichha kaa paalan karnaa
 The principle of 'public will' introduced by Russo later became the basis of modern democratic theory
 ruso ne aise nagarikon ke sahaj samudaay kalpana kii thi jo oonch- neech ke sambandhon se pare samanta or ekta ke vaahak honge, isliye unhen vishwaas tha ki unke bich main ‘jan-ichha’ uplabdh karnaa aasaan hoga
 But Rousseau could never answer the question of how the 'journal-will' would come out of the wishes expressed in the general assembly of citizens
 isliye ant main ve yah kehete hue nazar aaye ki agar ‘jan- ichha’ nahin uplabdh ho paa rahi he to bahumat kii ichha ko hi uskaa paryaay maan liya janaa chahie
 The principle of sovereignty has also been taken up by the advocates of liberal-democratic thought
 unka kahana he ki bahultavaadi or loktantric shashan ke sandarbh main samprabhutaa kii dharna anaavashyak he
 These people consider the idea of sovereignty as suffering from its totalitarian past and therefore undesirable
 unka kahana he ki loktantric sarkarein damankaaree mashinari dwaara thope jane vaale kathith rup se vidhisammat shashan dwaara nahin chalatin
 They rule through an equation of control and balance and a network based on it
 darasal, sanghatmak charitra vaale aadhunik rajyon main aantarik samprabhutaa kaa centre tay karnaa bahut mushkil he
 In federal states such as the United States, Canada, Australia and India, the government is divided into two levels and each level has its own autonomous powers
 is prakaar ke rajyon main samprabhutaa centre or paridhi ke bich saajhedaari ke rup main ubhartee he
 In such a situation, if there is an undivided sovereign then it is the constitution which makes the center also sovereign and the states as well
 bahya samprabhutaa antarrashtriya vyavastha main kisi rajya kii haisiyat kii dyotak he
 There are also situations that the internal sovereignty of a state continues to be disputed, but its external sovereignty is respected in the international arena
 vaise bhi loktantron ke yug main aantarik samprabhutaa ke masale ab itane zyaada ahm nahin maane jate, par bahya samprabhutaa kaa prashn pehle se kahin zyaada mahatvapurn ho chukaa he
 There are many international disputes in which the claim of sovereignty of one country is seen as a challenge to its sovereignty from another country
 philistiniyon dwaara apane samprabhu raashtra ke liye chalaaya jane vaala andolan isroyal ko apni samprabhutaa ke kshay kaa kaarak lagata he

 Gandhi, Shastri Jayanti - On October 2, 1999, the editor of this magazine Prof
 Pratipal 'bal' wrote in his foreword, dedicating the blessings of Asmita to the members of the Lok Sabha in the name of Swagat Patrika and as a prasad to other leaders
 : Remove and erase is the difference of sky
 is antar ko na samaj paane se bahut se log angreji hataao kaa naam sunate hi aape se baahar ho jate hai or is samiti ke sadasyon ko pagal kii padavi se sushobhit karne lagate hai
 We accept our madness
 par yah paagalpan buddhi kaa diwaliyapan na hokar thik vaisaa he, jiske bare main sufi fakir ne kaha he- 'paa gal asli, pagal ho ja
 ' ham pagal hai rashtriyata ke liye, desh kii asmita ke liye, desh ke nanhen-munnon kii buddhi se ho rahe balaatkaar kii rokthaam ke liye, bharat ke mastishk ko videshi sadaangh se bachaane ke liye, desh ke swatantra chintan ko na ubharne dene vaale aavaran ko hataane ke liye
 We are not against English language or teaching it
 angreji kii anivaaryta ke tathaa angreji madhyam kii anivaaryta ke or angreji ke saarvajanik prayog ke virdohi hai
 We want to remove English, we do not want to erase it

 aaj hindustan main usne jo jagah hathiyaa rakhi he, uske kaaran hindustani bachche ke dimag ko lakva maar rahaa he, hindustani yuvakon kaa moulik chintan dhwast ho rahaa he
 We are told that why do not parents explain that they should not teach their children in English-medium schools
 is bare main ham itnaa hi kahenge ki aaj angreji ke saath izzat judi he, rutaba judaa he or naukari judi he
 So, which parent would want to deprive their children of them? Our injury is due to the malpractices of the government, due to which the adopter of native languages is not able to become a character of dignity nor even of a considered livelihood
 hamase yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki jab aap angreji madhyam skulon ke virdohi hai to aryasamaj, sanatandharm, jainiyon, sikhon aadi kii ore se bade paimaane par khole ja rahe angreji madhyam ke public skulon kii ninda kyon nahin karte ? inke khilaaf aawaaj kyon nahin uthaate ? In this regard, we believe that all these schools are the product of government malfeasance
 ye sansthaayen swechha se in skulon ko nahin khol raheen
 The government's malpractices were encouraging the schools of those Christian missionaries who are in favor of both English and British
 ye skool un isai skulon ke dushprinaam ko kam karne ke liye sthapit kiye ja rahe hai
 We believe that as soon as the government policy changes, the medium of these will become the lingua franca
 ham sarkaar ke navoday skulon ke avashya viruddh hai kyonki ye angreji ke prati rujhaan badha rahe hai
 We are strongly opposed to Dehraduni style English schools, because these schools are propagators of English and English

 tadit yaa "akashiya bijli" vayumandal main vidyut aavesh kaa discharge hona or usase utpann kadakadaahat ko tadit kehete hai
 About 16 million lightning is produced every year in the world
 sambhavat: anya kisi bhi prakritik ghatana ne itnaa bhay, romaanch or aashcharya nahin utpann kiya hoga or na aaj bhi karti hogi jitna taditapaat or badalon kii kadak se utpann hota he
 From time immemorial, the belief was prevalent in almost all the countries of the world that lightning is the punishment of God, which he inflicts on the creature or object on which he becomes angry
 greek or roman deshvasi ise bhagwaan jupiter kaa prahaardand maan te the
 Even today, many people think the same and rely more on the superstition that has been cultivated instead of trying to understand the scientific cause of lightning
 pracheen dharmagrathon main varnit anek kathaayen unke is andhvishwaas ko bal detii hai
 When there was some increase in the electrical information, the scientists came to the idea that the phenomenon of lightning is similar to the way the condenser flows through the air between the plates when it is exposed
 is dharna kii pushti karne ke liye prayog karne kaa saahas kisi ko nahin hota tha; kintu ant main benjamin franklin kii prerana se france ke do vaigyanikon, dalibard or delor, ne prayog karne kaa nishchay kiya
 He took two metal rods
 dalibard kaa chad 40 foot tathaa delor kaa chad 99 foot unchaa tha
 With both rods, they were able to immerse sphulings of about one and a half inches in length
 yah prayog anyant khatarnaak tha or aage chalakar ek anya vaigyanik ne yahi prayog doharaate samay apane praanon se hi haath dhoyaa tha
 Nevertheless, it could not be determined from the above experiment that the electricity generated in the sticks came from the clouds, because the rods had no access to the clouds
 isaliye benjamin franklin ne apana patangvaala suvikhyath prayog kiya
 He flew a kite and carried it inside the clouds
 jyonhi patang kii door bhigi, patang or door donon hi tan gaye jisase yah pataa chalaa ki donon vidyut aavesh yukt ho gaye he
 Franklin also tied a key in that door
 chaabi ke paas ungali le jane se donon ke chatchathat kii aawaaj ke saath sphulingon kaa visarjan hua
 Not only this, he also charged him by touching the key with a leaden jar
 isse yah nishchit ho gaya ki badalon main bhi vidyut hoti he
 The immersion in the electric form of this power is called "lightning"
 yah visarjan badal or badal, athwa badal or prithvi, ke bich ho saktaa he
 Lightning usually occurs in the Kapasivarshi clouds
 in meghon main atyant prabal urdhvagami pavandharaayen chalati hai, jo lagbhag 40,000 foot kii oonchaai tak pahunchati hai
 There are some such activities in them, due to which the electric charges are generated and dissociated
 in kriyaaon ke spashtikaran ke liye wilson, simpasan, sakrij aadi ne apane siddhant prastut kiye hai, jo paraspar virdohi jaan padate hai, kintu itnaa to sabhi batalaate hai ki tadit kii jananaprakriya meghon main hoti he or iske liye un meghon main vidyaman jalsikar, athwa himakan aadi avakshepan kan, hi uttaradaayi hote hai
 Even with respect to the electrification of clouds, all are unanimous that their upper levels are rich and the middle and lower levels are negative
 in aaveshon kaa vibhaajan meghon ke andar shunya degree sein0 tapawale staron ke bhi kaaphi upar hota he
 From this, it is easy to conclude that the charge is formed by the snowflakes formed in the clouds and the upward wind currents, not by the water droplets
 kabhi-kabhi nimna str main bhi kahin-kahin dhanaveshon kaa ek centre sa ban jaataa he
 Due to the formation of negative charge at low levels of clouds, the positive charges are generated by induction at the bottom of the earth
 badalon ke aage badhane ke saath hi prithvi par ke ye dhanavesh bhi thik usee prakaar aage badhate jate hai
 Attracted by negative charges, the surface positive charges climb up to the conductor or semiconductor objects standing on the earth
 is vidhi se jab meghon kaa vidyutikaran is seemaa tak pahunch jaataa he ki padosi aaveshkendron ke bich vibhav pravanta vibhang maan tak pahunch jaati he, tab vidyut kaa visarjan deergh sphuling ke rup main hota he
 This is called lightning
 prithvi kii ore aanevaali tadit kai kramon main hokar pahunchati he
 a hilol of electrons from the cloud comes down 50 meters in 1 micro second and stops
 lagbhag 50 maa0 se0 ke pashchaat doosraa kram aarambh hota he or isi prakaar kai kramon main hokar ant main yah tarang prithvi tak pahunchati he
 This is called major trauma
 apane udgamasthal se prithvi tak pahunchne main ise kul 0
002 second tak kaa samay lagata he
 The above facts were revealed by the photo taken by Schönland and his colleagues with the help of a highly sensitive camera
 usee photo pattica par yah bhi dikhalaai padaa ki pramukh kram ke prithvi par pahunchne ke kshan hi ek atyant tikshan jyoti prithvi se meghon kii ore unheen kramon main hokar gai jinase hokar pramukh kram aayaa tha
 This is called regressive emergency
 jahaan pramukh kram kaa ausat veg 105 meter prati second hota he vahiin pratigaami aadhaat kaa veg 107 meter prati second hota he, kyonki uskaa maarg pehle se hi ynit hone ke kaaran prashast rahata he
 Even after the above major and regressive strokes, many strokes are seen moving downwards and upwards respectively
 ye dwitiyak aghat kehalaate hai
 These secondary accidents coming down do not come in the same order as the major shock
 si0 epa0 vagner or ji0 di0 mccan ne batalaaya he ki badalon ke vibhav praaia: do karod volt kii koti ke hote he
 Simpson and Screege concluded by experiments that the potential of clouds at a height of 10,000 feet often declined at a rate of 50 to 100 volts per cm
 tadit prakriya ke bich main vidyuddhara kaa maan do lakh se pandrah hajaar ampiore ke bich rahata he
 Due to this strong current, the molecules and atoms of air entering the path of lightning ionize and produce light
 yahi chamak hamen damini ke rup main dikhalaai padati he
 It is clear that through air the electrification between the clouds and the earth will be more probable where the power will have to cross the resistance of the air to a minimum
 isaliye unchi minaaron, unche bhawanon, ekaaki vriksh tathaa pataakadand ityadi par taditapaat adhiktar hota he iskaa ek kaaran yah bhi he ki koi vastu badal se jitani hi adhki nikat hogi, usapar utana hi adhik prarit aavesh utpann hoga
 Apart from this, due to the point of the minarets, tree peaks, etc
 being more flat than the flat ground, the electric charge accumulates on them more
 taditaghatjanit vidyuddhara ekadish hoti he
 In the period of five microseconds of shock, its value increases from exponential order to maximum and decreases to only half within about 25 microseconds
 yah prabal dhara praaia: 100 microsecond tak rahati he
 After this, some of the decreasing thousand respectively reach the ampere and it remains the same for some millennium seconds
 yadi taditaghaat kii punrariti nahin hui to kam hote hote yah dhara nishesh ho jaati he
 There are generally three types of lightning: vistrut tadit kaaphi vistrut kshetra par hoti he or iskaa aviral prakaash badalon par kaaphi dur tak fail jaataa he
 Striped or lined lightning is often visible
 isamen ek yaa adhik prakasharekhaayen, sidhi yaa tedi idhar-udhar daudti hui drushtigochar hoti hai
 In this, the electric discharge would be from cloud to cloud, cloud to earth or cloud to atmosphere
 yah tadit swayan teen prakaar kii ho sakati: Like a lighted ball lightning the condom, the earth is seen coming
 iskaa ausat vyas 20 senmi0 hota he
 As it moves towards the Earth, its velocity decreases
 lagbhag teen se paanch second tak dikhalaai padane ke uparaant vah atyant prachand dhwani ke saath visphotit ho jaati he
 It appears very rare and the cause of its origin is unknown
 bhawanon ko tadit ke sidhe aghat se bachaane ke liye benjamin franklin dwaara viksit tadit dand vyavastha sarvaadhik shreshth he
 An iron rod, with its upper end pointed like a spear and protruding to the very top of the building, is buried deep inside the ground through the side of the building
 nichalaa sira bhoomi main taanbe kii ek pattica main laga hota he
 This lightning not only paves the way for the minimum resistance to lightning existing in the cloud, but it instantly transmits the induced currents produced on the building to the earth immediately
 is prakaar yah badalon or bhawan ke bich aaveshon ke parsparik aakarshan kii sambhaavna bhi paryaapt gata detaa he
 Since the past, during the days of electric cymbals, sailors have been seeing the erosion of the lightning of the clouds from the mast of their ships
 yah ksharan raat ko adhik spasht dikhalaai padataa he
 It is called the fire of the European sailor Saint Elmo
 aajkal taditaniyantran sambandhi anek prayog kiye ja rahe hai
 a recreational experiment was done by sitting a person in a motorcar and sending artificial light from top to bottom on that motor
 chunki tadit main vidyaman electranon main, samaan aaveshyukt hone ke kaaran, paraspar vikarshan hota he, isaliye motorcar kii chat par girte hi ve bikhar gaye or uski deevaaron se hote hue neeche prithvi main chale gaye
 This could not penetrate the motor and the person remained completely safe
 is prayog se yah nishchay ho jaataa he ki aadhunik dhaatu ke dhaanchevaale bhawanon main, jinaki neenv kaaphi gahari hoti he, baitha hua vyakti tadit ke prahaar se atyant niraapad hota he
 If such buildings, or light-headed buildings, cannot be found, then shelter should be taken in such a large building which is quite wide
 tadityukt aandhi tufaan ke samay angithiyon, stove tathaa vidyut ke anya suchalkon se swayan ko yathashakti dur hi rakhana chahie
 Those outside should never live on top of the hills, on piles of straw, etc
, under isolated trees, near gnomes, or near any metal object, nor should anything be made of metal
 pahaado kii kandaraon main, ghaney wanon athwa kisi dhaalu pahari ke neeche rahanaa sarvatha niraapad hota he
 It is such a system in which it has the special property of instantly reducing the charged potential
 saath hi yah apane andar se pravaahit hone vaali taditdhaara kii prabalata main vruddhi ko roktaa he
 It usually consists of an internal arrangement, which is connected in series to a resistor
 iskaa pratirodh isamen pravaahit vidyutddhara ke maan main vruddhi hone ke saath ghatata he
 The function of differential device is that it keeps the non-linear resistor completely isolated from the reciprocating current
 in donon main sampark tabhi ho paata he jab itnaa unchaa vibhav utpann ho jaataa he jo khaali sthaan kii vaayu ko bhi suchalak bana detaa he
 Thus the lightning current flows safely through the earth without damaging the power circuit of the alternating current
