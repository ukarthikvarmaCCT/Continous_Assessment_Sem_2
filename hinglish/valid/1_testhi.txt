1 khz allocation, the 136 khz band, is available to amateur radio operators in some countries in Europe, New Zealand and French overseas dependencies
 The world record distance for a two-way contact is over 10,000 km from near Vladivostok to New Zealand
 As well as traditional Morse code many operators use very slow computer controlled Morse code or specialized digital communications modes
 a proposal at the WRC-07 World Radiocommunication Conference aims to make this a worldwide amateur radio allocation
 The UK allocated a 2
8 khz sliver of spectrum from 71
6 khz to 74
4 khz beginning in April 1996 to UK amateurs who applied for a Notice of Variation to use the band on a noninterference basis with a maximum output power of 1 w ERP 
 This was withdrawn on 30 june 2003 after a number of extensions in favor of the European-harmonized 136 khz band
 a 1-watt transmission of very slow Morse Code between G3AQC and W1TAG spanned the Atlantic Ocean for 3275 miles on November 21-22, 2001
 In the United States there is a special license free allocation in the longwave range called lowfer
 This experimental allocation between 160 khz and 190 khz is sometimes called the "lost Band"
 Unlicensed operation by the public is permitted south of 60 degrees north latitude, except where interference would occur to ten licensed location service stations located along the coasts
 Regulations for use include a power output of no more than 1 watt, and an antenna / ground-lead length of no more than 15 meters, and a field strength of no more than 4
9 microvolts / meter
 Also, emissions outside of the 160 khz – 190 khz band must be attenuated by at least 20 db below the level of the unmodulated carrier
 Many experimenters in this band are amateur radio operators
 a regular service transmitting RTTY marine meteorological information on LF is the German Meteorological Service 
 The DWD operates station DDH47 on 147

 samadesh yaa 'vyadesh' vah aadesh he jise nyaayalay apane samta sambandhi adhikaron ke antargat kisi paksh yaa nigam ke naam kisi ko karne ke liye, kisi kaam ko karne ke liye, kisi kaam ko karne se rokane ke liye vaa koi aisa kaam karte rahane ke liye jari karata he jise karne yaa na karne kii use baadhyataa ho
 This order of the court applies to the individual personally
 Violation of this order is considered defamation of the court
 yadi koi vyakti is dhang kii manahani kare to uski sampatti jabt kar liye jane kii vyavastha he
 Under the Indian Legislation, in cases where punishment of a person or confiscation of property is not effective, in those cases, according to Civil Procedure Code Order 21 Rule 32, the court can order any person receiving the decree or any other person to perform the prescribed work
 is sthiti main ukt kaary sampadan karne kaa puraa vyay us vyakti ko vahan karnaa padegaa, jise mulat: ukt kaary puraa karne kaa aadesh diya gaya tha
 The command can be acceptable and also prohibitive
 sweekaaratmak vaa aadeshaatmak samadesh ke dwaara prativaadee ko koi aisa kaary karne kaa aadesh diya jaataa he jise karnaa kanoonee drushti se uske liye laazmi he
 By the injunctive or restraining order, the defendant is ordered to retire from doing any work or maintaining a position
 samadesh kaa sweekaaratmak vaa nisheghaatmak rup main vibhaajan us kaary ke swaroop par nirbhar karata he jiske sambandh main nyaayik nirdesh jari kiya jaae
 There are again two divisions of the command - interchangeable and permanent
 is dhang kaa vibhaajan do baton kaa dhyaan main rakhkar kiya jaataa he- ek to yah ki aadesh kii yah avadhi kitni he or duusari baat yah he ki nyaayik prakriya kii kis avasthaa main aadesh jari kiya gaya he
 It can be said broadly that the interlocutory order is one which is effective till the completion of the hearing of the case
 sthaayee samadesh maamle kii sunwaayee puri hone ke baad aavashyatanusaar jari kii jaati he
 The issuance of a permanent injunction means to permanently deprive the defendant of any such right or prevent him from doing any act which is against the rights of the plaintiff
 bahut aavashyaktaa hone par prativaadee kaa bayaan liye bina keval vaadi ke aavedan par hi ekapaksheeya samadesh bhi jari kii ja sakati he
 But the unilateral order issued in this manner will remain temporary until the defendant submits to give his statement as per the information
 bhartiya nyaayalayon main is samay jin nyaayik upachaaron kii vyavastha he, ve sabhi nahin to unamem se adhiktar aise hai jo angreji nyaay vyavastha se le liye gaye the
 In the middle of the 19th century, there were two types of courts related to the said judiciary and the second court was the Samyam Court, also called the Court of Chancery
 saamaanya vidhaan ke nyaayalay rajya ke samaanya nyaayalay the
 The judiciary in these courts was based on the ancient customs of the country
 un pracheen ritirivaajon ko hi saamaanya nyaay kii sangya de di gai thi
 Used to live in the court of general or parity
 sthool rup se yah kaha ja saktaa he ki saamaanya nyaay main jo trutiyaan thim, samya ke siddhant par aadhaarit nyaay vyavastha main unka niraakaran se spasht ho jaati he
 According to the general justice, all kinds of damages were done by money
 mana k ke paas ek acre jameen he jo 'kha' kii jameen se mili hui he or 'k' 'kha' se is aashay kaa qaraar karata he ki vah use 'kha' ko vah jameen qaraar kii tithi se chha: maheene ke baad bech degaa evam hastantarit kar degaa
 Then after one month of this first agreement, 'A', if he sold the land to a third person 'C', then in this situation, the general law could only order the liquid to compensate for the damage caused by breaking the agreement
 
 duusari ore is dhang kii sthiti main samya kaa nyaayalay samadesh jari karke 'k' ko keval is baat se roak hi nahin saktaa tha ki vah 'ga' ko jameen na beche apitu is baat kaa vishisht nirdesh bhi kar saktaa tha ki ukt bhoomi upyukt samay par 'kha' ko bech or hastantarit kar di jaae
 This makes it clear how much was needed to remove the flaws in this form of general legislation
 saath hi isse samta sambandhi nyaay ke adhikarashetra kii seemaa kaa bhi pataa chal jaataa he
 In situations in which economic returns are equally useful, special remedies will not be used under parity
 kintu yadi nyaas yaa is prakaar ke anya adhikaar kaa ulanghan hota ho or saamaanya vidhaan main ukt adhikaar bhang kii abhigna na ho, us sthiti main samya ke antargat vishesh upachaaron kii vyavastha he
 This theory and its related sub-principles will be found everywhere in the field of command law
 bhartiya ucch nyaayalayon ke vibhinan shashapatron ke madhyam se bahut se anya upachaaron ke saath saath samadesh jari karne kii vyavastha bhi england se hi bharat main laai gai he
 Part III of the Specific Deprivation Act of India 1877 mentions the elemental rules governing the command
 prakriya sambandhi kuch baton kaa vivechan civil prasodyu ral code ov india main kiya gaya he
 If the defendant infringes on the property rights of the plaintiff or deprives the plaintiff of the property's consumption or threatens to act in this manner, the court may issue a permanent injunction to the defendant in the following situations: Of the trustee of the property or when there is no means of knowing that the infringement of the property rights of the plaintiff by the defendant is actually a How much damage has been done, or where the damage is of such a manner that substantial deviation from the capital by its substance is not possible, or where there is a possibility that the supply of the damage is not provable by the substance, or where the extension of the judicial process is prevented It has become necessary to issue a command
 vidhayak sanstha ko aavedan karne se kisi vyakti ko samadesh nahin roak sakati, sarkaar ke kisi vibhaag dwaara sampadit kiye janevaale prajasambandhi kaaryon main bhi samadesh hastkshep nahin kar sakati, kisi videshi sarkaar ke rajsambandhi kaaryon main bhi samadesh hastkshep nahin kar sakati, aparaadh sambandhi maamalon kii sunwaayee ko bhi samadesh dwaara nahin roka ja saktaa or na hi samadesh dwaara kisi ko aisa qaraar todane se roka ja saktaa he jiske nirvaah ke liye vah vishesh rup se patibaddh na ho
 If the applicant, by his own permission or by any of his behavior, makes himself an officer of the command, in that case the command will not be issued in favor of that person
 saamanyat: kisi sarkari vibhaag ko kartavyapaalan se nahin roka ja sakati lekin iskaa arth yah nahin he ki bhartiya nyaayalay sarkaar ko yaa sarkaar ke kisi vibhaag ko avaidhanik kaary karne se yaa karte rahane se nahin roak sakate
 Sometimes a command is necessary to maintain a contract
 kintu aisi sthiti main yah aavashyak he ki us qaraar kaa vishisht rup se nirvaah sambhav ho sake
 This has caused some difficulty in contracting personal services
 saamanyat: vyaktigat sevaaon ke qaraar vishisht rup se jabaran karyanvit nahin karaae jate
 For example, if a famous singer contracts for five years in a auditorium called 'A' and also agrees that he will not sing elsewhere in this period, but only after one year has passed
 In case of refusal to sing in the auditorium, the court will not specifically give permission to the singer to sing in the auditorium of 'A'
 kintu nishedhaatmak ajna pradaan kar nyaayalay nirdhaarit avadhi samaapt hone tak us gayak ko anyatra gane se roak saktaa he
 Some judges are of the view that there is no need for injunctive covenant in so many words when on the other hand it is expressed that even where there is a clear prohibitive covenant, the court may not allow its execution even if it so By doing so, the covenanter is forced to forcibly stop his work
 bharat main vishisht avamukti adhinium ke khand 57 main die gaye 'si' tathaa 'di' udaahranon se ek spasht drushtikon vyakt ho jaataa he
 Prohibitive covenants can be indicative and need not be expressed
 us sthiti main samadesh jari kii ja sakati he chaahe iskaa parinaam prativaadee ko anyatra kaam karne se rokna hi kyon na ho
 If the treaty has not taken shelter of any unjust instrument and no event occurs during the period of observance of the contract which causes some complication in the personal relationship, then in such a situation, the approach of the Specific Discontinuance Act to discharge the agreement Only, preference should be given to other approaches
 bharat main saamanyat: bombai, madras or kalakatta, in teen presidensiyon ke ucchtam nyaayalayon ke adhikarashetra ke baahar paramadesh, utpreshan lekh aadi asaadhaaran nyaayik upachaaron kii vyavastha nahin thi
 Therefore, the command was a treatment under which ordinary civil courts could issue injunctions against government officials or departments when they did something which was outside their authority or was illegal or they were doing something like this Threatened to do
 america main kisi samay samadesh kaa prayog mazdooron ke khilaaf kiya jaataa tha or iske dwaara unhen apane niyoktaaon ke saath kiya gaya qaraar puraa karne ke liye baadhya kiya jaataa tha
 This is the reason that the command-related treatment was somewhat maligned there, but now that situation has gone away
 bharat main samadesh kabhi is dhang kii museebaton main nahin padi
 Command treatment is currently included in the general requirements and India is one of the countries where it has an important place in the general judiciary

 angrezon ne jab saal kaa lagaan doogana vasuulne kaa aadesh diya tab raja puuran singh se lagaan maaf karwaane kii vinati karne gaanvvaale bhuvan ke saath british chhavnee gayi
 There the king was watching the game of British officers playing cricket
 jab ek afasar ne ek gaanvvasi ko gaali di to bhuvan afasaron se jhagarh pada or cricket ke khel kii barabari gilli-danda se kii
 In front of the king, Bhuvan lodged his protest against harsh rent
 captain rassal ko yah pasand nahi aayaa or usne bhuvan ko cricket khilne kii chunauti di
 Forgive the year's revenue if you win, lose three times the rent !!! The villagers wanted to face this challenge, but Captain Russell only gave this decision in the hands of Bhuvan
 chunauti ko or badhaate, teen saal kaa lagaan maaf karne kaa bhi laalach de diya
 Bhuvan accepted the invitation to fight on the ground
 ab sara champaner maano bhuvan ko suuli par chadhaana chahta tha
 Everyone's life was going to be destroyed now
 magar bhuvan ke liye to jab tak saans tab tak aas
 The drought was going on for many years
 aakhir ek saal kaa lagaan bhi to kahaan se bharte? or phir captain rasal bhi to chunauti se nahin hatane vaale the
 Receiving Bhuvan, he made a wooden bat and ball
 kuch gine-chune logon kaa dal chhodkar, sara gaanv bhuvan ke khel par hans rahaa tha
 This team started to go to the camp secretly after learning of cricket
 vahaan captain rasal kii bahan olizabath ne unako jhaadeeyon main chhipe dekh liya
 He did not like his brother's dealings with the villagers
 vah gaanv ke khilaadiyon ko gaanv ke najadik maidan par cricket sikhaane lagi
 a servant would also bring with him from the cantonment for Hindi translation
 dhire-dhire, sahaj-sahaj, bhuvan kaa ye dal apane apurv dhang se cricket kaa khel seekhney lagi
 They used to cut wood to strengthen their hands
 filding seekhney murgiyon kaa peechha kar unhe pakadtey
 The bullet began to bowl, twisting its hands like a windmill
 ab gaanv ke logon main bhi utsaah dikhne laga or akhir das khiladi to ban gayi
 One day while playing, the ball fell near the trash
 kachra gaanv kaa achhut safaai sevak tha
 When returning, he swung the ball like this and stunned Bhanki
 gaanv kii team ko gyarahavaan chayan mil gaya
 But how would the village adopt an untouchable? They do not even touch it
 gaanv or sadiyon se chali is parampara kii bhuvan ne aalochana kii
 The residents of the village agreed with Bhuvan's heartfelt words
 akhir muqaabale kaa din jaagaa
 People came from all over the province to watch the game
 captain rasal ke varisht afsar bhi maujuud the
 The game was decided for three days
 gaanvvasion ne pehle gend fankna shuru kiya
 He had a good beginning
 jald hi ek ranaute se vikat giri
 Another blonde player was out after being stunned by the unique ball of the shot
 magar british khilaadi bhi kam na the
 Slowly he continued to handle the innings
 achaanak kachra gend ghumaane se rahaa
 Lakha also lost many catches
 pehle din ke ant main gori toli haaavee thi
 That night, Elizabethan saw Lakha meeting Captain Rasel in the camp
 ab pataa chalaa kii lakh gaanvvaalon se gaddari kar rahaa tha
 Alizabath used to train the villagers with Cricet, he told this to Captain Rasel
 yah bhi bataaya kii kach bhi jaanboojh kar gawaae
 When the villagers came to know, they wanted to remove the skin of Lakha
 unse bhaag nikle lakh ne gaanv ke mandir main panaah lee
 Lakha confessed that he was deceived by jealousy of Bhuvan
 vah bhi bhuwan kii tarah gauri ko chahta tha magar gauri bhuvan ko pasand karti thi
 One chance and Lakha were given
 agle din lakh ne zabardast kach kiye
 Garbage also started running its magic again
 us ne ek saath teen gendon main teen vikaten lee
 The Whites' innings ended at about three runs
 bhuvan kii toli ne ballebaazi kii joardaar shuruuaat kii
 Deva, a former soldier of the British army, was dismissed from the commission
 phir british khilaadion ne gaanv ke ballebzon kii ninda kar unako akulaayaa or ve jald out hone lage
 The second day ended and the half-runs were yet to be scored
 udhar aadhi team out ho chuki thi
 But Bhuvan was still alive in the game
 tisare din gaanv ke baid ishwar kaaka ne or ismail ne bhuvan kaa saath diya
 Ismail was hurt the previous day
 bahut javaabdari se dono ne ballebaazi kii
 Both were run-out
 ab kachra ne ballebaazi sanbhali
 Bhuvan tried very hard to handle more batting
 akhrari gend par kachra ko chha rano kii zarurat thi
 But he was able to take only one run
 kya gaanvvaale haare? ampaire ne no-ball kaa ishaara kiya
 Now Bhuvan faced another ball
 bhuwan ne chakka maaraa or gaanv muqaabala jeet gaya
 And it also started raining
 captain rassal ko unke varishton ne madhya afarika bhej diya
 Alizabeth Bath returned
 rote rote bhuvan or gaanv ke logon se usne bidaai lee
 At the end of the film, a voice-over tells that Captain Russell's changed Africa and that Elizabethan whole life was considered as Radha of Bhuvan
 bhuwan or gauri kaa vivaah ho gaya

80 crores rupee There is a book in Harshacharita Sanskrit composed by Banabhatta
 isamen bhartiya samraat harshavardhan kaa jeevancharit varnit he
 It is the oldest Sanskrit book related to historical plot
 is samay uplabdh harshcharit aath uchhvaason main vibhajit he
 The first two and a half sighs are in the form of Baan's autobiography
 taduparant sthanishwar ke punyabhuti vansh, jinamein harsh ke pita prabhakarvardhan kaa janm hua tha, kaa varnan he
 Baan has described the marriage of Prabhakarvardhan's daughter Rajyashree and Kannaujadhipati Grahavarma Maukhari
 apane jyeshtha putr rajvardhan ko hunon kaa hanan karne ke liye bhejkar prabhakarvardhan jvergrast ho gaye
 Baan has described his illness, death, cremation and self-immolation of the Empress Yashomati
 tabhi goud evam maalav senaaon ke kannauj par akraman tathaa grahaverma kii hatya kii soochna milti he yah sunakar rajyavardhan kannauj kii ore bade
 The enemies laid down their arms
 parantu chaalaaki kheli
 Rajyavardhan was invited to the enemy camp and brutally murdered
 harsh ne apane bahanoi evam bhai kii hatya kaa badla lene kii pratigya kii tathaa kannauj kii ore prasthaan kiya
 The enemy fled in front of Harsha's growing army
 yah sunakar harsh ke vismay kaa ant na tha ki rajyashri kaid se chhootakar vindhyachal kii ore chali gai
 After much diligent search, Harsha, eager to commit self-immolation, found Rajyashree near the ashram of friend Rishi and brought him to his camp on the banks of the Ganges
 yahan granth aksmaat samaapt ho jaataa he
 It is said that Baan's idea was not to completely write the character of Harsha
 vah iskaa keval maatr eiansh likhnaa chaahate the kyonki unhone apane shrotaaon ko batalaaya he ‘harsh ke jivan kaa varnan’ saikadon jiwanon main bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa
 If you want to hear a part of it, then i am ready
 yah bhi thik hi kaha jaataa he ki ‘harshcharit’ harsh ke jivan kii keval ek ghatana maatr he kyonki harsh charit se uplabdh aitihaasik gyaan bahut hi kam he
 But while criticizing this book, we should not see it as a historical work
 vastutah use aitihaasik kathanak se yukt ek kavy kahana hi adhik yuktisangat he
 The author's full power is focused on showcasing poetic talent and historicity is secondary to him
 unhone kriti ke pratinayak bhoot goud evam maalav raajaaon kaa naam bhi nahin diya he
 Even after the determination to make the land void of the Gaudas, Baan has left the future events of the Gaudas
 jahaan pathak vindhyaparvat main se harsh kii gaveshna ke parinaam ko sunne ko utkanthit hai vahaan baan vindhyaparvat kaa sookshm varnan karne main sanlagn hai
 Astu, Baan have presented a beautiful picture of Harsha's departing army, Rajya Sabha, religious communes , villages, which is very important from the point of view of history

 Bajirao II befriended the British and with his help received the post of 'peshwa' and gave many Maratha territories to the British for that
 bajirao dwitiya swaarthee or ayogy shaasha tha tathaa mahattvakankshi hone ke kaaran apane pradhanmantri naanaa fadanvis se irshyaa karata tha
 Fadnavis died in 1800 AD and Bajirao himself became anxious to take power

 The frightened Peshwa Bajirao II fled to Basai in 1801 and took refuge in the British and signed Basai's treaty on 31 December 1802 on an English ship
 iske dwaara usne east india company kaa ashrith hona sweekaar kar liya
 The British pledged to re-incarnate Bajirao II in the capital Poona and to protect the Peshwa, he took the responsibility of having sufficient army in the state
 iske badale main peshwa ne company ko itnaa maratha kshetra dena sweekaar kar liya, jisase company kii sena kaa kharch nikal aae
 He also promised that he would not hire people from other European countries who had enmity with the British

 Subsequently, he fought two more battles - Bhima Koregaon in 1 January 1818, in which the British defeated 27,000 Maratha soldiers of Peshwa by his army, which was less than the number of Marathas, including 500 Mahar soldiers
 Later defeated in the battle of Ashti
 usne bhaagane kii koshish kii, lekin 3 june, 1818 i
