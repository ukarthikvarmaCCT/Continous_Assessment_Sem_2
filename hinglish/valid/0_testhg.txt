 This happens in two ways: tanu anishek janan main anishek janan dwaara utpann jantuon main cendrakasutron kii sankhya dvigun athwa bahugun hoti he
 This happens in two ways: swatassansechak anishek janan main niyamit rup se cendrak sutron kaa yugmanubandh tathaa hraas hota he or cendrak sutron kii sankhya andon main aadhi ho jaati he

 1947 main angrejo ke bharat chhodane ke pehle or baad main jammu evam kashmir kii riyasat par naye bane dono rashtron main se ek main vilay kaa baari dabaav tha
 According to the document of the agreement on the partition of India, the kings of the princely states had the right to choose one of the two nations, but Hari Singh, the Maharaja of Kashmir, wanted to keep his princely state independent and refrained from joining any nation
 angrejo ke bharat chhodane ke baad riyasat par riyasat par pakistani sainiko or pashtuno ke kabeelai ladaako ne hamalaa kar diya
 Fearing that the princely army would not be able to face them, the Maharaja sought military assistance from India
 bharat ne sainik sahaayta ke evaj main kashmir ke bharat main vilay kii shart rakh di
 Upon the assent of the Maharaja, India recognized this merger and made the princely state a new state in the name of Jammu and Kashmir
 bhartiya sena kii tukadiyaan turant rajya kii raksha ke liye tainaat kar di gayi
 But Pakistan disagreed on the validity of this merger
 chunki jati aadhaarit aankade uplabdh nahin the isaliye maharaj ke bharat se vilay ke peeche kya kaaran the yah tay paanaa kathin tha
 Pakistan argued that the Maharaja did not have the right to call the Indian Army because before the arrival of the British there was no post of the Maharaja of Kashmir and this post was appointed by the British only
 isaliye pakistan ne yuddh karne kaa nirnay liya par uske sena pramukh duglas greysi ne is aashay ke pakistani pradhanmantri kaa aadesh maanane se inkaar kar diya
 His reasoning was that the Indian forces occupying Kashmir were representing the British state and hence they could not fight it
 haalanki baad main pakistan ne senaayen bhej di par tab tak bharat kareeb kareeb do tihaayi kashmir par kabja kar chukaa tha This war was within the boundaries of the pre-jammu and Kashmir princely state, the Indian Army paramilitary force and the armies of the former Jammu and Kashmir princely state and the Pakistan Army paramilitary force and the tribal fighters of the North West Frontier State of Pakistan who called themselves as the Army of Azad Kashmir

 The tribal fighters of Azad Kashmir were busy in looting after the initial successes, and they proceeded to delay attacking the easily occupied new territories, and the Indian army was flown in as soon as the Maharaja agreed to merge with India
 With the help, he gave a chance to reach the soldiers

 vahaan pahunch kar unhone riyasat kii sena ko majboot kiya or srinagar ke chaaro ore rk suraksha gheraa banaaya or aaazaad kashmir sena ko haraa diya
 This security circle also included the rear-circling of the opponents by armored vehicles of the Indian Army

 He repulsed a counter-attack done on Tithwal

 For a long time, the contingent of the princely Kashmir state was still successful in protecting Skardu from Gilgit Scout, so the Pakistani army was not able to move towards Leh
 agast main chitral kii sena ne mata-ul-mulk ke netrutv main scardu par hamalaa kar diya or topakhane kii madad se scardu par kabja kar liya
 This led to Gilgit Scout going further towards Ladakh

 During this time the siege on Poonch continued
 ab bhartiya sena sabhi kshetron par pakistani sena or usase samarthit aaazaad kashmir sena par baari hone lagi thi
 Poonch was liberated from a year-long siege and the Indian army liberated Kargil by chasing him down after finally defeating him by the Gilgit Scout, who had been achieving good success so far, but the Indian Army was forced to attack further
 There could have been a problem of supply of logistics, so they had to stop the Pakistan Army was not expecting the tank to take the Zojila Pass with the help of tanks
 And have uprooted their feet immediately

 After occupying this pass, Dras was easily captured

 After a long negotiation, both sides agreed to a ceasefire

 or is yuddh ke baad bharat kaa riyasat ke saath pratishat or pakistan kaa 40 pratishat bhubhag par kabja rahaa
 The use of armored vehicles and light tanks was very important in the two phases of this war, they were used in very small numbers in both
 ye charan the These incidents suggest that the attack of armored vehicles in unlikely places puts mental pressure on the enemy
 aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki hamalaavaron ne tagerodhi hathiyaaro kaa prayog nahin kiya shaayad unhone aavashyak na jaanakar unhe peeche hi chhod diya
 The success of the use of armored vehicles left a deep impression on India's war policy
 During the war with China, the Indians worked very hard to use armored vehicles in difficult terrain, but in that war, the armored vehicles did not get the expected success

 Once the mobilization was completed, the change in the Line of Control slowed down and victory was limited to only those areas with low military density, such as the high areas of the northern Himalayas in which the army of Azad Kashmir was initially successful

 The other two Satyambhas of this trilogy were Nagarjuna and Shamsher Bahadur Singh
 uttar pradesh ke sultanpur jile ke katgharaa chiraani pattee main jagardev singh ke ghar 20 agast 1917 ko janme trilochan shastri kaa mul naam vasudev singh tha
 He received his MA from Kashi Hindu University
 He received the title of Shastri in English and Sanskrit from Lahore
 uttar pradesh ke sultanpur jile ke chote se gaanv se banaras vishvavidhyalay tak apane safar main unhone darjanon pustaken likhin or hindi sahitya ko samrudh kiya
 Shastri was a staunch opponent of marketism
 haalanki unhone hindi main prayogdharmita kaa samarthan kiya
 He said, the more uses the language has, the richer it will be
 shastri ne hameshaa hi navasrujan ko badhaava diya
 He was a catalyst for new writers
 sagar ke muktibodh srajan peeth par bhi ve kuch saal rahe
 He died on 9 December 2007 in Ghaziabad
 trilochan shastri hindi ke atirikt arabi or farsi bhashaaon ke nishnaat gyaata maane jate the
 He has also been very active in the field of journalism
 unhone prabhakar, vanar, hans, aaj, samaaj jaisi patr-patrikaon kaa sampadan kiya
 Trilochan Shastri was also the National President of Jan Sanskriti Manch from 1995 to 2001
 iske alaava varanasi ke gyanmandal prakaashan sanstha main bhi kaam karte rahe or hindi va urdu ke kai shabdkoshon kii yojana se bhi jude rahe
 He is known as the master of Hindi sonnets
 unhone is chand ko bhartiya parivesh main dhaala or lagbhag 550 sonet kii rachana kii
 Apart from this, he also enriched Hindi literature with story, songs, ghazals and criticism

 digant or dharti jaisi rachanaaon ko kalambaddh karne vaale trilochan shastri ke 17 kavita sangrah prakashit hue
 Trilochan left a distinct mark in language style and content
 trilochan ne vahi likhaa jo kamazor ke paksh main tha
 He was a distant voice of the toiling and downtrodden society
 unki kavita bharat ke gram or dehaat samaaj ke us nimna varg ko sambodhit thi jo kahin dabaa tha kahi jag rahaa tha kahin sankoch main padaa tha
 i am a poet of the district who is hungry, hungry, ignorant i am not aware that art does not know what it is, it does not believe trilochan ne lok bhashaa avadhi or pracheen sanskrit se prerana lee, isliye unki vishistataa hindi kavita kii paramparaagat dhara se judi hui he
 The funny thing is that due to being so closely associated with his tradition, he had the beauty and taste of modernity
 pragatisheel dhara ke kavi hone ke kaaran trilochan marxvaadi chetana se sampann kavi the, lekin is chetana kaa upyog unhone apane dhang se kiya
 His poems apparently do not speak of the Left ideology in the same way as the poems of Nagarjuna or Kedarnath Agarwal
 trilochan ke bheetar vichaaron ko lekar koi badbolapan bhi nahin tha
 In his writings, a belief floated everywhere that only the public would play the revolutionary role of change
 vaise to unhone geet, ghazal, sonet, kundaliyaan, barbai, mukt chand jaise kavita ke tamaam madhyamon main likhaa, lekin sonet ke kaaran vah zyada jane gaye
 He was the son of Sonnet in modern Hindi poetry
 hindi main sonet ko vijaateey mana jaataa tha
 But Trilochan Indianised it
 iske liye unhone rola chand ko aadhaar banaaya tathaa bolchaal kii bhashaa or lay kaa prayog karte hue chatushpadi ko lokrang main rangane kaa kaam kiya
 The compositions he composed in this verse were probably not done by poets like Spencer, Milton, and Shakespeare
 sonet ke jitne bhi rup-bhed sahitya main kiye gaye hai, un sabhi ko trilochan ne aajamaaya
 Trilochan Shastri was awarded the Shalaka Samman by the Hindi Academy in 1989–90
 hindi sahitya main utkrisht yogadan ke liye unhe 'shastri' or 'sahitya ratna' jaise oopaadhiyon se sammanit kiya ja chukaa he
