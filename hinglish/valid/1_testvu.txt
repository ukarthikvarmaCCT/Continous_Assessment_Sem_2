 On 11 February 2016, it was announced in Washington, Germany, Hannover and some other countries cities together in the US that direct evidence of the existence of gravitational waves in the universe has been found
 khagolavidon kaa maananaa he ki gurutveey tarangon kii pushti ho jane ke baad ab brahmad kii utpatti ke kuch or rahasyon par se pardaa uth saktaa he
 Detection of gravitational waves is not easy because when they reach the Earth, their amplitude is very small and the volume of the crystal is about 10–21 which is very small in terms of measurement
 isaliye is kaam ke liye atyant sugrahi sansuchak chaiye
 The signals from other sources are very obstructive in this work
 anumaanatah gurutveey tarangon kii aavriti 10−16 Hz se 104 Hz hoti he
 In theory, every object that is accelerating produces a gravitational wave
 kintu kam dravyaman evam kam twaran vaali vastuon se utpann gurutveey tarang itani ksheen hoti he ki unhen maapna bahut kathin he
 The more powerful an object is and the higher its acceleration, the more powerful it will also generate gravitational waves
 udhaaharan ke liye, brahmad main ye gurutveey tarangen tab paidaa hoti hai jab koi bahut baari-bharkam akashiya pind apane jivan antim avasthaa main teji se badhane lagati he or unamem visphot hota he
 Likewise, powerful gravitational waves are produced when two Viratkaya Krishna vivars collide into one, pulling each other

 When Martand Verma was 23 years old, he took the throne of Venad
 unhone dach ko kuchal ladaai 1741 main vistaaravaadi dizin ko kharaab kiy
 Martand Varma then expanded the European mode of discipline in his army and the Venad domain for the vicinity
 unhone ek paryaapt sthaayee sena kaa aayojan kiya or nair abhijaat varg kii shakti ko kam kiya or travnakor line par uske rajya kii uttari seemaa gadhwale
 Travancore under Marthanda Varma was one of the few states in India determined to consolidate their power by the use of sea outlets
 vyapaar kaa niyantran bhi avadhi ke shashan kala main mahatvapurn ke rup main dekha gaya tha
 It was also Martand Verma's policy to protect Syrian Christians, the larger trading community within their domains, as a means of limiting European participation in trade

 The city of Thiruvananthapuram became the chief under Marthanda Varma and made it the capital of Travancore in 1745

 travnakor kanyakumari, bhartiya up mahadweep ke dakshini sire ke uttar main attindgal se dene ke liye ek choti si riyasat thi
 Within this small state known as the cause of the power of the king was only nominal in the power of the nobles

 The powers of the ruler were also largely restrained by the managing committee of the great pagoda of Padmanabha at Attar Yogam, Thiruvananthapuram

 It was Lord Martand Varma born in 1706 that the state was powerless under the refractory nobles where these conditions were
 raja ram verma madurai nayakon ke saath ek sandhi par hastakshar kiye or ettuvitil pillamar or anya vidrohi saradaaron kii gatividhiyon kii jaanch karne ke liye desh main ek videshi bal surakshit ki martand verma, apane praarambhik varshon se ek budhimaan rajkumaar tha or yah 1726 main uski salaah par tha
 Previously he also styled himself as the "prince of Neytinkara" in 1723, signing a treaty with the English
 is aath lords ke cruddh or is tarah ve rajkumaar kii hatya karne par amada kii
 As a result Marthanda Varma lived in hardship for many years traveling from a place to escape his enemies, where he had to flee the capital for the protection of northern states such as Adi Kotakarakara, Kayamkulam
 martand verma sirf ek chatur or kaarykushal raja nahi the lekin ek sakasham general bhi the
 In his military conquests, he was cleverly assisted by Ramayan Dalva, later his prime minister

 In 1731 Quillon or Kollam, which was ruled by a branch of the Venad family, was defeated and after the death of their previous king, Marthanda Varma signed a document allowing the merger of his kingdom
 tab tak quilon ek venaad sahaayak ho gaya tha
 Martand Verma next looked towards Kayamkulam, when the alliance with the Quilon family tried to stop the development of Venad
 us varsh kii antim ladaai main kaaymkulam ke raja ko maar daalaa gaya tha or jald hi shanti ke liye mukadmaa or shatruta pal ke liye samaapt ho gaya, jo apane bhai se safal rahaa

 In a later interview with Maharaja Martand Varma, relations between the Dutch and Travancore became further strained
 yah dach rajyapal travnakor ke pradeshon par akraman karne kii dhamkee di he jab maharaja vah dach malabar main durvyavhaar maamle main holland par akraman hota he ki ek prabhavi jawaab diya ki kaha jaataa he
 In 1741 the Dutch Empire invaded and routed the Dutch army and ran to Queen Cochin and, finally receiving a pension from the Dutch, finally fully captured Travancore at Kotarakara against the will of Marthanda Varma to Elliedth Swaroopam on Kotarkara The queen was restored

 The kingdom of Travancore was dedicated to Lord Sri Padmanabha in 3 January 1750 and was then called Sripadpanabha Vanchhipala Marthanda Varma Kulasekherperumal and Maharaja, taking the title of state rule Padmanabha Dasa as the servant of that deity

 vah ek shandaar sainya karier ke baad 1758 main do saal ke baad nidhan ho gaya jab tak raja kaa swasthya uske baad se bigadati shuru kar diya tha
 He consolidated into the kingdom which was succeeded in 1758 by his nephew Maharaja Karthika Thirunal Ram Varma Dharma Raja

 The main instructions were to intervene with them and to maintain all the pujas in Sri Padmanabha temple without attempting to maintain above all the existing friendship between the honorable association and Travancore and to take full rest in them
 Self-confidence

 Another main instruction was that state spending should not exceed its revenue

 Trita is the central and esoteric doctrine of Christianity related to the inward form of God, which is called trinity
 tritv kaa arth he ki ek hi ishwar main teen vyakti hai -- pita, putr tathaa pavitra aatma 
 These three are equally eternal, infinite and omnipotent because human wisdom can reach the existence of only one almighty creator God by reason of logic
 vastut: tritv ke dharmasiddhant par isiliye vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki uski shiksha isa ne di he
 The first half of the Bible shows that monotheism was given special emphasis in Judaism
 bible ke uttarardh main isa us akeshwar ko banaae rakhte hue bhi yah shiksha dete hai ki main or param pita parameshwar ek hi hai 
 Apart from this, he tells his disciples that i will send the Holy Spirit away and will be with you in a dark way
 us pavitra aatma ko bhi vah ishwariya gunon se samanvit maanate hai
 In this way Jesus clearly states that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit exist in the same God
 baad main tryek ishwar kii is visheshta ko tritv kaa naam diya gaya he
 Christianity has tried to explain this doctrine of the Trinity with the help of Greek and Latin philosophical terms - three persons exist in the same divine nature
 teenon tatvat: ek hai
 Hence, all three have the same determination and the same intelligence
 phir bhi pita, putr or pavitra aatma main parsparik bhinnata he
 Father is not born to anyone
 putr adikaal se pita se paripurna ishwartv grahan karata he
 This origin of the son is called fertility
 pavitra aatma kii utpatti ko prajnan kehete hai
 The origin of the Holy Spirit is believed to be from both father and son and is called diffusion
 putr ke prajnan tathaa pavitra aatma se prasaran se teenon vyaktiyon kii parsparik bhinnata utpann hoti he, kintu tatvat: teenon ek hai or samaan rup se sabhi ishwariya gunon se samanvit hai
 
 shatabdiyon tak is dharmasiddhant par chintan kiya gaya he or tatvasambandhi anek dharanaon ko bhraamak tehraaya gaya he
 Trinityism, which assumes three distinct divine elements, is clearly misleading, since the existence of three independent deities is thus acknowledged
 modalism ke anusaar pita, putr or pavitra aatma ek hi ishwar ke teen pahalu hai jo sristi ke kaaran utpann ho jate hai -- pita srishtikarta he, putr hamaara uddhaar karata he tathaa pavitra aatma hamako pavitra karata he
 The church rejected this suit in the third and fourth centuries, stating that before creation, there were three persons in God
 nisea kii vishwasabha ne tritv vishyak un sabhi vyakhyaaon ko bhraamak tehraaya he jinke anusaar putr athwa pavitra aatma pita se gaun maane jate hai
 In that assembly it is clearly declared that father and son are essentially the same

 duusare, jaise german darshanik hidegar pracheen unani model par swayan ko maanavtaavaadi samajhate the lekin unka vichaar tha ki maanavtawaad keval german jati or vishesh rup se naajiyon par hi lagu hota tha or is tarah davis ke shabdon main ve maanavtawaad-virdohi maanavtaavaadi the
 Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of twentieth-century wars "it would no longer be possible to concoct idioms such as man's destiny or the triumph of human reasoning without the quick realization of the mistakes and greed that they bring behind
" Because "it is impossible to even imagine a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reasoning
 Yet he goes on to say" It would also be unreasonable to leave the ground assumed by historical humanists
 Because on many occasions humanism is the only alternative to bigotry and oppression

 It believed that studies that develop human intelligence are those that make humans "most truly human beings"

 Strengthening a faculty was considered to be beneficial to other faculties
 An important branch of educational humanism at the end of the 19th-century was American Education Commissioner William Tory Harris, whose "five Windows of the Soul" was considered particularly appropriate for "the development of the faculties"
 terry eagleton jaise marxvaadiyon ne kuch naaji yatnaa shivi ke rakshakon ke parishkrut saanskrithik swaad ko ingit karte hue is tarah ke vichaaron kii aalochana kii he
 Humanism progressively reflects an overall sensitivity to our species, earth and life

 This acceptable approach reverts to Renaissance humanism in that it pre-imagines the role of humanists' favoritism towards the system of governance, and is equally responsible for the responsibility of a proactive life vision that transcends individual humanism
 yah pradooshan, sanyavad, rashtrawaad, sexwad, nirdhantaa or bhrashtachar ko hamaari prajatiyon ke hiton se asangat, maanviya charitra ke sthai or dhyaan dene yogya muddon ke rup main pahchaan karata he
 It insists that the human governance system should be unified and is holistic, in that it does not separate a person merely on the basis of the logic of his / her attendant beliefs
 ise apane aap main aghoshit maanavtawaad kaa paatr kaha ja saktaa he jo manushya ke vyaktigat siddhanton kii purti karne ke liye prajati ke siddhanton or vishwaason kii shiksha detaa he
 This is in contrast to contemporary American and British humanism, whose tendency is to focus on religion to the extent that "humanism" is often equated with general atheism in these societies and especially by new followers
 ekal avishvaas ke saath is atyantik pahchaan karne ko sambhawatah ab maanavtawaad ke vyapak or yogya angikaran ko hataakar maanavtaa kii sabase moolyawaan or sambhaavnaaon se purna bauddhik paramparaon main se ek kii anuchit kaat-chhaant ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Dwight Gilbert Jones writes that humanism may be the only philosophy our species can fully adopt - so it is not appropriate for holistic humanists to impose unbridled and selfish terms on their potential followers, nor to associate it with religious extremism
 yahan maanav man par kisi ne bhakthi or nishtha kii maang ke alokik dabaav kaa koi vajan mahasoos nahin kiya
 Humanity - with all its unique abilities, talents, concerns, problems, possibilities - was the center of interest

 sayan ne anek granthon kaa pranayan kiya he, parantu inaki kirti kaa merudand vedbhaashya hi he
 Before these, nobody wrote, the commentary of the four Vedas is not available
 ye 24 varshon tak vijaynagar samrajya ke senapati evam amaatya rahe 
 The early Vedic scholars of Europe and Shri Aurobindo and Shri Ram Sharma Acharya of modern India have also been admirers of his commentary
 yask ke vaidic shabdon ke kosh likhane ke baad sayan kii tikaa hi sarvamaanya he
 Saiyan has instructed the essential facts about his character in his compositions

 His father's name was Mayan and mother's Mrs

 Krishna was a follower of the Taittiriya branch of the Yajurveda
 inke agraj vijaynagar samrajya ke sansthaapak maharaj harihar ke mukhyamantri tathaa aadhyatmik guru the
 His name was Madhwacharya, who came to be named as Vidyacharan Swami of Sringeripeeth at the last time of his life
 sayan ke anuj kaa naam tha bhoganath jo sangamanaresh ke narmaschiv tathaa kamaneey kavi the
 Sayan has mentioned his three sons in his treatise called Alankar Sudhanidhi, of whom Kampan was proficient in musicology, Mayan was a prolific poet in prose-poetry and Shingan was a Vedic penetrating the chronology of Veda
 vedbhaashyon tathaa itar granthon ke anusholan se sayan ke ashrayadaataaon ke naam kaa spasht parichay praapt hota he
 Sayan was also proficient in governance and he was not proficient in the work of an army hero in the battlefield
 vijaynagar ke in chaar rajanyon ke saath sayan kaa sambandh tha - kampan, sangam, bukk tathaa harihar 
 Of these, Kampan was the second son of Sangam I
 or harihar pratham ke anuj the jinhone vijaynagar samrajya kii sthapana kii thi
 The Kampans ruled over the eastern region of Vijayanagar
 sangam dwitiya kampan ke aatmaj the tathaa sayan ke pradhan shishy the
 He was under the supervision and supervision of Sayan since childhood
 sayan ne unke adhinsth praant kaa badi yogyata se shashan kiya
 He later attained the mantra of Maharaja Bukkarai and remained prominent in the same Amatyapada even during the reign of his son and successor Harihar II

 Thus they

 Bukk Maharaj was the Prime Minister for about 16 years from 1421-1437 and V

 Harihara II was the principal Amatya for about eight years till 1438-1444
 prathit hota he ki lagbhag pachchis varshon main sayanacharya ne vedon ke bhashya pranit kiye 
 In this way, the emergence of Sayan took place in the first half of the 15th century Vikrami
 sayan kaa jivan agraj madhav ke dwaara itnaa prabhavit tha tathaa unke saath ghulmil gaya tha ki panditon ko bhi in donon ke pruthak vyaktitv main paryaapt andeh he
 It is primarily necessary to resolve it
 madhavacharya 14veen shatee main bhartiya vidvajjanon ke shikhamani the
 He was not only a scholar of the Vedas, theology and epistemology, his reputation as the savior of the Vedas and the propagator of the Vedic religion has not been tarnished even today
 unheen ke aadhyatmik upadesh tathaa raajnneetik prerana kaa suprinaam he ki maharaj harihar raay ke rup se vijaynagar samrajya kii sthapana kii
 Madhwacharya thus had full support in the establishment of this empire, so he was also reputed as the Prime Minister for the smooth conduct of state work
 yah unheen kii preranashakti thi ki in donon sahodar bhoopalon ne vaidic samskruti ke punarutthan ko apane samrajya sthaapan kaa charam lakshya banaaya or is shubh kaary main ve sarvatha safal hue
 As a result, we can consider Madhwacharya as the forerunner of the Vayman Vedic renaissance in South India in the 14th century
 mimasaa tathaa dharamshastra ke prachur prasar ke nimitt madhav ne anek moulik granthon kaa pranayan kiya- Critics may be skeptical about the composition of the last book, but the six predefined texts are Madhavacharya's unquestioned works
 anek varshon tak mantri kaa adhikaar sampann kar or samrajya ko abhisht siddhi kii ore agrasar kar madhavacharya ne sanyas le liya or shringery ke mananeey peeth par asin hue
 His name was this ashram - Vidyaranya
 is samay bhi inhone peeth ko gatisheel banaaya tathaa panchadshi naamak granth kaa pranayan kiya jo advait vedant ke tatwon ke parigyaan ke liye nitant lokapriy granth he
 In the assembly of the Vijayanagara emperor, Amatya Madhava was a very different person from Madhvacharya, who has written an explanation called Sutparyadipika above Sutasamhita
 sayan ko vedon ke bhashya likhane kaa aadesh tathaa prerana dene kaa shrey inhen madhavacharya ko he
 For this reason, Sayan has named Vedabhashya as "madhaviya Vedarthaprakash"
 sayan ke teen guruon kaa parichay unke granthon main miltaa he- Sayanacharya is adorned with the fame of 'vedabhashyakara'
 parantu vedbhaashyon ke atirikt bhi unke pranit granthon kii satta he jinamein anek abhi tak aprakashit hi pade hue hai
 The names of these texts are- subhashit sudhanidhi - niti vaakyon kaa saras sankalan
 This seems to be his proto-text due to the creation of Kampan Bhupal Kesamay
 praayshchitt sudhaa nidhi - karmvipak naam se bhi prakhyat yah granth dharm shaastra ke praayshchit vishay kaa vivaran prastut karata he
 Alankar Sudha Nidhi - The exponent of Alankar, this book was divided into ten moments

 So far, only three have been received

 Ayurveda Sudhanidhi - Instructions of this treatise on Ayurveda mentioned above
 The text containing 3 has been done
 yajna tantra sudhanidhi - yagyanushthan vishay par yah granth harihar dwitiya ke shasankaal kii rachana he
 Metalism - This vivid and elaborate practice of Pannean metals is particularly famous in grammars due to its scholarly and authenticity
 yah madhaviya dhaatuvritti ke naam se prasiddh hone par bhi sayan kii hi ni:sandigdh rachana he - iskaa parichay granth ke upodghaat se hi spashtat: miltaa he
 Vedabhashya - It is a sign of many texts rather than a single book
 sayan ne veda kii chaaron samhitaon, katipay brahmanon tathaa katipay aaranyakon ke upar apane ugantarkari bhashya kaa pranayan kiya
 He built his languages on five Samhita and 13 Brahmin Aranyakas, whose names are as follows: sayanacharya swayan krishnayajurveda ke antargat taittiriya shakha ke adhyeta brahman the
 As a result, firstly he wrote his Taittiriya Samhita and the commentary of the Tatsambdha Brahmin Aranyaka, he later made a commentary of the Rigveda
 samhitabhashyon main atharvaveda kaa bhashya antim he, jis prakaar brahman bhashyon main shatapathbhashya sabase antim he
 Both of these languages were practiced by Pranayan Sain in the reign of Harihara II in the evening of his life
 sayan ne apane bhashyon ko "madhaveey vedarthprakash" ke naam se abhihit kiya he
 Seeing the "madhyavya" adjective with the name of these languages, many critics are tempted to consider it a cynical composition of the sion, but there is no room for doubt
 sayan ke agraj madhav vijaynagar ke raajaaon ke preranadayak upadeshta the
 With his teachings, Maharaj Harihar and Bukkarai were ready to carry on the important task of revival of Vedic religion
 in mahipatiyon ne madhav ko hi vedon ke bhashya likhane kaa bhaar saunpa tha, parantu shashan ke visham kaary main sanlagn hone ke kaaran unhone is mahneey bhaar ko apane anuj sayan ke hi kandhon par rakhaa
 Sayan has mentioned this in the subtraction of the Rigveda commentary
 falat: in bhashyon ke nirmaan main madhav ke hi prerak tathaa aadeshak hone ke kaaran inkaa unheen ke naam se sambhddha hona koi aashcharya kii baat nahin he
 This is a sign of a husky reverence towards his elder brother from Sayan
 isiilie dhaatuvritti, bhi, "madhaviya" kahalaane par bhi, sayan kii hi ni:sandigdh rachana he jiskaa ullekh unhone granth ke upodghaat main spashtat: kiya he- Certain critics are skeptical about the Vedic interpretations being an attribution
 sanwat 1443 vi
 ke mysore shilaalekh se pataa chalata he ki vaidic maarg pratishthapak maharajaadhiraj harihar ne vidyaarany shripad swami ke samaksh chaturveda-bhashya-pravartak narayan vaaypeyayaji, narhari somyaji tathaa pandri dikshit naamak teen brahmanon ko agrahar dekar sammanit kiya
 Both the time and the subject of this inscription are important
 isamen uplabdh "chaturveda-bhashya-pravartak" shabd is tathy kaa dyotak he ki in teen brahmanon ne vedbhaashyon ke nirmaan main vishesh kaary kiya tha
 These pandits seem to have assisted Saina in the implementation of the Vedic interpretations and therefore, welcoming him in front of Vidyaranya Swami confirms the above conjecture
 itane vipulkaay bhashyon kaa pranayan ek vyakti ke dwaara sambhav nahin he
 As a result, Sayan was revered as the leader of this schism and this work was done only with the help of the eminent scholars of that period
 sayan se pehle bhi veda kii vyakhyaayein kii gai thim
 Some are also available
 paranchu samast veda kii granth raashi kaa itnaa suchintit bhashya itahpurv pranit nahin hua tha
 This Vedbhasya of Sayan is written with a view to Yagnic laws, but this does not mean that they have not pointed to the spiritual meaning of Veda
 vaidic mantron kaa arth to sarvapratham brahman granthon main kiya gaya tha or isi ke aadhaar par nighantu main shabdon ke arth kaa or nirukt main un arthon ke vishadikaran kaa kaary sampann hua tha
 In Nirukta, only the number of mantras is included
 itane vishaal vaidic waan may ke arth tathaa taatpary ke prakatikaran ke nimitt sayan ko hi shrey he
 Sayan Bhashya really acts as the key to unraveling the mysteries of the odd fortification of the Veda
 aaj vedarth mimasaa kii nai paddatiyon kaa janm bhale ho gaya ho, parantu veda kii arth mimasaa main panditon kaa pravesh sayan ke hi prayatnon kaa fal he
 Today's Vedartha is particularly indebted to the parish critic Acharya Sayan
 maxmooler aadi paashchaatya vidwaanon ne isi bhashya ke val par hi vaidic sahitya main gati badhaaya he
 In the history of Vedartha Mimamsa, the name of Sayan is worthy of writing in Suvarnaksharas

 The palace is now under civilian control
 yah mahal is dweep ke paryaton aakarshanon main mukhya he or shahar ke itihaas sangrahalay kendra kaa sthaan he
 a popular guess about the plan of the palace and the circular towers associated with it, often discussed by academics, is that the upper complex is built by heredians of the west coast because it is likewise circular, its There is also a main centered tall tower and three smaller towers are also found in both places equally
 yah teen chote-chote tower mukhya tower se lage hue hai or mukhya tower ek pul se judaa he jo ki aasapaas ke ilaake ko ghere hue he

 Kshatriya,, Kshatra, Rajajnya - These four words are generally used in the meaning of the second varna and caste of Hindu society, but they have their own special meanings and sounds due to their relation to the ancestors in specific historical or social context
 'kshetra' kaa arth multah 'veery' athwa 'paritran shakti' tha
 But later the word began to denote the class that presided over other varnas through the scriptures
 vedon tathaa brahmanon main kshatreey shabd rajvarg ke arth main prayukt hua he jaatakon or ramayana, mahabharat main kshatreey shabd se samant varg or anek yuddhrat jan abhihit hue hai
 The Sanskrit word was divided into four classes called "kshas dasyon ho whole kshatriya, vaishya and shudra"
 smritiyon main kuch yudhparak janajatiyaan jaise ki kiraat, dravidu, gurjar aabhir, sabar, maalav, sivi, trigart, yauddhey, khas tathaa tangan aadi, vratya kshatreey varg ke antargat anusuchit kii gai
 Traditionally, rulers and soldiers used to be part of the Kshatriya class, whose task was to wage war to protect the society in the war period and to provide good governance in the peace period
 jase gurjar pratihaar rajvansh ne arab hamalo se bharat ko 300 varsho tak bachaay rakhaa paali bhashaa main "khatriy" kshatriya shabd kaa paryaay he
 In the Rigvedic regime, the head of the entire clan was called "rajan" and the title of Rajan was not hereditary
 kabeeley kii samiti jisamen mahilaayein bhi bhagidaar hoti thim, raja kaa sarv sahmati se chayan karti thi
 It was Rajan's duty to protect the people and livestock of the clan
 raajpurohit rajan kaa sahyogi hota tha
 In the initial phase there was no separate army but later a separate class of ruler and soldiers emerged
 us samay samaaj ke chaar varnon main vibhaajan kii pranali nahin thi
 The "purusukta" of the Rigveda describes the mythological history of the four varnas
 kuch vidwaan purushasukt ko rugveda main antahprakashit maanate hai, jo ki vaidic sahitya kii mul sanrachana ke muqaabale naveen tarkon par zyada aadhaarit he
 Since all the Indian castes are not mentioned in the Vedic society, that is, the Purusha Sukta was written to advocate the hereditary caste system
 vaikalpik vyakhya yah bhi he ki purushasukt ke alaava rugveda main anya kahin bhi "shudra" shabd kaa prayog hi nahin hua he, atah kuch vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki purush sukt uttar- rigvaidic kaal kaa ek sangyojan tha, jo ek damankaaree or shoshak varg sanrachana ko pehle se hi astitv main hone ko nirupit va vaid banane hetu likhaa gaya tha
 Although the word "kshatriya" is not used in Purusukta, the word "rajan" has been used, yet it is considered as the first occasion in the Vedic bibliography where all the four characters of the society are used at one time and together
 "rajanya" shabd kaa prayog sambhawatah us samay raja ke sambadhiyon hetu prayukt hua mana jaataa he, jabaki yah samaaj ke ek vishisht varg ke rup main sthapit ho chuke the
 In the late stages of the Vedic period the word "rajnya" was replaced by the word "kshatriya", where the word "rajnya" indicates relation with the king and the word "kshatriya" refers to the power influence or control over a particular region
 "rajanya" shabd pramukh rup se ek hi vanshavali ke tahat pramukh sthaan ko pradarshit karata he jabaki "kshatriya" shabd shashan yaa shaasha ko
 Jaiswal argues that the word "brahman" also appears to be rare in the Rigveda, that it has come only in "purusukta" and may not have been used for a particular priestly class
 panini, patanjali, katyayan va mahabharat ke aadhaar par jaisawal maanate hai ki rajnatik varg ko rajanya naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa tha tathaa rajanya loktantrik rup se chune huye shaasha the
 Rulers selected from democratic process such as Andhak and Vrishni etc
 are considered examples in this context
 ram sharan sharma darshaate hai ki "rajanya " va "vis " ke madhya badhate huye dhruvikaran ke uparaant kaise vibhinn vansh pramukhon dwaara ek sarvamaanya mukhiya kaa chayan hota tha jiske falswaroop ek taraf shaasha varg tathaa duusari taraf "vis" jaise pruthak virgon kaa vibhedikaran utpann hota gaya
 The word Kshatriya originates from "kshatra" which means cosmic authority and power, it has less to do with the successful leader in war and more on the tangible power of claiming sovereignty over a region
 yah anuvaanshik kabeeley kii bhoomi par swaamitv kaa pratik he
 There is a difference of opinion on the social status of the Kshatriyas in the Brahmin era

 The order of the current Brahminical tradition - Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras, became stable after the theology period
 buddha kaal main praayah kshatriya utkrisht varg mana gaya
 In Hindu society, there has always been a rivalry between Brahmins and Kshatriyas for primacy, but only Rajput society is recognized as the highest varna

 chinnamantooru main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke anantpur jile kaa ek gaanv he
 In the context of a chemical reaction, chemical equilibrium is the state in which the concentration of reactants and products does not change over time
 praayah yah avasthaa tab aati he jab agr kriya kii gati paschkria kii gati ke samaan ho jaati he
 It is worth noting that the velocity of the forward and backward are not zero at this stage but are equal
 yadi ucch taap par kisi band prakriya paatr main hydrogen tathaa iodine ko anvik anupaat main saath saath rakhaa jaae, to nimnaankit kriya prarambh hoti he : In this process, hydrogen iodide is formed by combining hydrogen and iodine and the amount of hydrogen iodide increases with time
 is kriya ke vipareet, yadi shuddh hydrogen iodide gas ko 500 degree celsius tak kriyapaatr main garam kiya jaae, to is yogic kaa vipareet kriya ke dwaara vighatan hota he, jisase hydrogen iodide kaa hydrogen tathaa iodine main vighatan ho jaataa he tathaa in utpaadon ke anupaat main samay ke saath saath vruddhi hoti he
 This action takes place in the following form: uparyukt donon hi kriyaaon main kriya kii gati kramash: mand hoti jaati he or ant main purnat: sthir ho jaati he
 This state of chemical action is called chemical equilibrium

 Even in physical equilibrium, the equilibrium constant can be determined in the above manner
 bhautikeey rasinic samyavastha ke siddhant kaa nirupan ooshmaagatiki se kiya jaataa he
 On the basis of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, the independent energy f is minimized in the part or system of an element, which is kept at constant temperature and constant pressure and in which physical chemical equilibrium has been established
 aantarik urja e tathaa dabaav p or aaytan v ke gunanfal ko jodne par tathaa yogafal main se taap t tathaa entropy ke gunanfal se praapt raashi ko gata dene se shesh raashi f ke baraabar hoti he
 Hence f = e + pv - TS
 In the above case, the transformation of free energy, whether it is work or not, is the same in both situations

 It is developed under a program called 'light Combat Aircraft' or 'yatra' which started in the 1980s
 vimaan kaa aadhikarik naam tejas 4 may 2003 ko tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne rakhaa tha
 The aircraft will replace the aging mig-21

 The major and most obvious goal was to develop the aircraft that replaced India's aging mikoyan-gurevich mig-21
 1970 ke dashak ke baad se mig-21 bhartiya vaayu sena kaa mukhya aadhaar rahaa he, lekin praarambhik udhaaharan 1983 main lagbhag 20 saal puraane ho gayi the
 The "long Term re-equipment Plan 1981" records that the mig-21's service life will come to an end by the late 1990s, and by 1995 the Indian Air Force will have 40 to meet the projected infrastructural needs of its force
 There will be a shortage of% planes

 Although Tejas has often been called a product of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, the responsibility for the development of Tejas is actually that of Ada, a national consortium of more than 100 defense laboratories, industrial organizations and academic institutions and Hialei as its main contractor
 
 NDA aupchaarik rup se bhartiya raksha mantralay ke raksha anusandhan or vikaas sanghathan ke tatwadhan main aata he
 The Indian government's goal of "self-sufficiency" for LCA includes the three most sophisticated and most challenging systems - fly by wire flight control systems, multi-dimensional pulse-doppler radar and after-burning turbo fan engines

 In addition, engines and radars are the only major systems in which Ada seriously considered foreign equipment replacement, although these were interim measures taken for early LCA aircraft, with more time for full development of the native version
 Was necessary, as was the case with the LCA Cauvery power plant

 Two of the five key technologies identified by ADA at the beginning of the LCA program, which could enable India to design and build "fully indigenous" fighter aircraft - improved carbon-fiber composite structures and Development and manufacture of the skin and a modern "glass cockpit
" In fact, Ada's integrated automated software system has a profitable commercial fabric that can be used to structure and develop 3-D wrapper composite elements
 anya teen pramukh praudyogiki pahal ke raste main ai samasyaon kii chaaya main in kamyaabiyon kii taraf zyaadaatar logon kaa dhyaan nahin gaya he
 However, as a result of the successes of India's domestic industries, 70 percent of LCA parts are being manufactured in India and India's dependence on the use of imported equipment will gradually reduce in the coming years

 This necessitated a fighter aircraft with multiple roles that could intercept at high altitudes and be suitable for ground attack by staying short distances
 ASR ko isaki bhi aavashyaktaa thi ki mul sanrachana ek unnat prashikshak ke rup main or jahaaz aaparishan anukulan ke liye upyukt ho, haalanki is vikalp ko baad main chhod diya gaya
 This resulted in the creation of India's first home-grown jet fighter, the subsonic HF-24 Marut, which first flew in June 1961

 In 1969, the Government of India accepted the recommendation of its Aeronautics Committee that Hieli should design and develop advanced aircraft fighter aircraft with a proven engine
 On the basis of 'tactical air support aircraft', ASR was the same as Marut in marked form
 iske baad hieli ne 1975 main sanrachana kaa adhyayan puraa kiya, lekin videshi nirmaataaon se chune hue "kshamta siddh ingine" hasil karne main asamarthta ke kaaran yah pariyojna puri nahin ho saki
 As the production of the Ajit attack aircraft continues, the structural work for the engineers of Hieli was little left, while the requirement of the Indian Air Force for air superiority fighter aircraft with secondary air support and interception capability remained unfulfilled

 PD kii samiksha karne or apni vyapak vimaanan visheshgyata ke aadhaar par salaah dene ke liye france ke daslt aviation ko salaahkaar ke rup main niyukt kiya gaya
 The PD stage is an early critical element in the aircraft structure and development process, as it results in key elements of a detailed structure, manufacturing approach, and maintenance requirements
 Furthermore, it is at this point that the overall program cost is most effectively controlled

 The LCA structure was finalized in 1990 and was intended as a small delta winged machine with "relax Static Stability" to enhance combat skills
 Almost immediately, there was some concern for some specified reasons, such as aviation electronic equipment and advanced composite infrastructure, and the Indian Air Force doubted whether India had sufficient infrastructure to support such an ambitious project
 a government review committee was formed in May 1989, which gave a general opinion that India has more sufficiency in most areas of infrastructure, facilities and technology to undertake the project
 haalanki, doordarshita ke ek kadam ke rup main yah nirnay liya gaya ki kaarykram ke purna paimaane par ejineering ke vikaas ke str ko do charnon main aage badhanaa hoga
 Phase-one will focus on "proof of Concept" and will include the structure, development and testing of two technology demonstrator aircraft and the formation of a structural sample test airframe and complete the Government of India LCA structure only after successful testing of TD aircraft
 Will support After this, the construction of two prototype vehicles and the necessary infrastructure and test facilities for the aircraft will begin
 The second phase will include the construction of three more prototype vehicles, a hard test sample and restoration of development and testing facilities at various centers
 charan-1 1990 main shuru kiya or hieli ne 1991 ke madhya main praudyogiki pradarshnon par kaam shuru kar diya, haalanki, vittiya sankat ke kaaran april 1993 tak purna paimaane par dhan adhikrut nahin kiya gaya, jiske parinamswaroop FSED ke charan-1 kaa kaam 1 june se shuru hua
 The first technology demonstrator, the TD-1, was completed on 17 November 1995 and then the TD-2 on 17 November 1998, but was kept on the ground for several years due to several structural concerns and trouble developing flight control systems
 
 elsie ke liye sabase mahatvakankshi aavashyaktaaon main se ek vinirdesan tha "relax static stability" 
 haalanki damelt ne 1988 main ek analog FCS pranali kaa prastaav diya tha, par kida ne mana ki digital udaan niyantran praudyogiki jaldi hi isaki jagah le legi

 The structure of most aircraft was "positive" for static stability, which means they have a natural tendency to return to a level and control flight in the absence of control information
 lekin yah gun payalat kii kushal prayaason ke vipareet hota hai
 On the other hand, an aircraft with "negative" static stability can divert from its level and controlled flight, unless the pilot constantly attempts to balance it, although it increases maneuverability, but it is very much up to the pilot to How much does a mechanical flight control system rely on

 When the LCA program was introduced, FBW was a state-of-the-art technology and was so sensitive that India could not find a country that would be ready to export it
 Therefore, the LCA National Control Law Team was formed in 1992 by the National Aeronautics Laboratory to develop its own version of India
 CLAW kii team ke vaigyanikon or ganitagyon ne apane niyantran kanoonon ko viksit karne main kamyaabi pai, lekin ve unka pareekshan nahin kar sake, kyonki bharat ke paas us samay samunnat "real time ground stimulators" nahin the
 Accordingly, in 1993 British Aerospace and Lockheed Martin were called for help, but the aeronautical development establishment's attempt to code control laws into FCS software proved to be a bigger task than previously expected
 vishisht niyantran kanoon kii samasyaon kaa BAE simulator main jaanch kii gayi
 While it was in the process of being developed, progressive elements of its coding were tested in the "minibird" and "ironbird" test rings at ADE and Hieli, respectively
 ekikrut udaan niyantran software kii F-16 VISTA par udaan ke dauraan duusari shrinkhalaa kaa simulation pareekshan kiya gaya
 Simulator, 33 test flights were completed in July 1996
 However, Lockheed Martin's involvement ended in 1998, as it was banned by the US in May that year in response to India's other nuclear tests
 NAL kii CLAW team ne ek samay swadesh main hi udaan niyantran kanoonon ke ekikaran ko safaltaapurvak puraa karne main kamyaabi pai or FCS saftware ne TD-1 par 50 ghante ke payalat pareekshan ko bina kisi rukaawat ke puraa kiya, iske parinamswaroop 2001 ke shuru main is vimaan ko udaan kii manjuuri de di gai
 In January 2001, the first flight of LCA took place from TD to the National Flight Test Center near Bangalore
 This was followed by its first successful supersonic flight on 1 August 2003
 In September 2001, the TD-2 got time to make its first flight, until 6 June 2002 it could not get this chance
 Tejas] kida kii team ne ek or mahatvapurn praudyogiki kshetra ko swadesh main viksit karne ke liye chunaa, jo tejas kaa bahu aiami radar he
 Initially it was planned for the LCA using the Ericsson microwave system PS-05 / AI / J-band multi-function radar developed for the Saab JAS-39 Gripen by Ericsson and Ferranti Defense System Integration
 haalanki, 1990 ke dashak main anya radaaron kii jaanch ke baad,drdo ko vishwaas ho gaya ki iskaa swadeshi vikaas sambhav he
 haili's Hyderabad division and LRDE were jointly selected to lead the MMR program
 haalanki yah bilkul spasht nahin he ki kab sanrachana kaa kaam shuru kiya jaayegaa, par radar vikaas kaa prayaas 1997 main shuru hua
 drdo's Center for Airborne Studies is responsible for running the testing program for MMR
 1996 or 1997 ke bich, CABS ne maujuuda hieli / HS-748M hawaii nigaraanee post testbed ko elsie ke electranik udaan pranali or radar ke test bed main parivartit kar diya, jise 'hack' kaha gaya or rotodom essembly ke alaava ekmaatr bade sanrachanaatmak parivartan ke rup main janaa gaya, iske saath elsie kii naak shanku ko MMR ke mutabik abhiyojit kiya gaya
 By 2002 MMR was reported to be experiencing development delays and cost overruns

 According to the test report, the root cause of the problem is the compatibility issue between Radar and the advanced signal processor module made by LRDE
 elta ke EL / M-2052 jaise 'aaf da self' videshi radar ko hasil karne ke antarim vikalp par gambhirtha se vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Initially, it was decided to equip the prototype aircraft with General Electric F404-GE-F2J3 afterburning turbofan engines
 ek hi saath, 1986 main, ek swadeshi bijli sanyantr ke vikaas ke liye samanaantar kaarykram shuru kiya gaya
 Under the leadership of the Gas Turbine Research Authority, the GTRE GTX-35VS, named "kaveri", was expected to replace the fully produced aircraft F404
 haalanki, takneekee kathinaaiyon ke kaaran kaveri vikaas kaarykram kii pragati dhimi ho gai
 In mid-2004, the Kaveri failed altitude tests in Russia and the final hopes of projecting it as the first production of the Tejas aircraft expired
 kaveri ke aage vikaas ke liye ek nivida jari kar companiyon ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 In February 2006, Ada contracted with French aircraft engine company Sneesma for technical assistance in solving problems in Kaveri
 us samay, DRDO ko tejas main upyog ke liye 2009-10 tak kaveri kaa ingine taiyaar hone kii aashaa hui
 In 2003, it was decided to purchase high quality General Electric F404, F404-GE-IN20 engines for eight pre-produced LSP aircraft and two naval prototypes, in view of the flaws in Kaveri's development
 kida ne farvari 2004 main ek america general electric ko 17-IN20 injanon kii abhiyantriki viksit karne va unke utpaadan ke liye 105 million america dollar kaa theka diya, jisaki aapurti 2006 main shuru hui
 In February 2007, Hieli ordered an additional F404-GE-IN20 afterburning turbofan engine to power the first operational squadron of Tejas fighter aircraft for the Indian Air Force
 samay par aadesh se pehle, F404-GE-IN20 ko pareekshan ke rup main halke ladaaku vimaan main lagaaya gaya or yah 2007 ke madhya tak pareekshan udaan ke antim moolyankan kaa ek hissaa tha
 The F404-GE-IN20 engine gained thrust without installing 19,000 pounds before being installed, completing a 330-hour accelerated mission test, equivalent to a 1000-hour flight
 IN20 ne F2J3 vikaas injanon kii jagah lee, jinase 600 udaanen bhari gayi or isamen aath injanon kaa upyog kiya gaya
 In September 2008, it was announced that Cauvery would not be ready in time for Tejas and would have to choose a power plant that was in the production process
 Ada plans to issue a request proposal for a more powerful engine with a 95 to 100 kiloneuton range
 iske sambhavit daavedaar eurojet EJ200 or general electric F414 ho sakate hai
 The propulsion offering of the Eurojet EJ200 has been strongly considered
 ekal crystal terbine blade praudyogiki, jise mul rup se bhartiya vaigyanikon ko dene se inkaar kar diya gaya tha, bhi eurojet ne EJ200 ingine ke madhyam se bharat ko dene kii peshkash kii
 In May 2009, it was announced that a global tender of Rs 3,300 crore would be floated to acquire more powerful engines for the aircraft, as the current General Electric F404 engines do not generate enough strength that the aircraft with the least weapon load Be able to attack
 eurojet terbo or america company general electric elsie ke liye 100 injanon kii aapurti ke liye pratispardhaa karengi
 The Eurojet EJ200 and GE F-414 engines will meet the requirements of the Indian Air Force as they generate 95–100 kilonuton strength
 bhartiya vaayu sena ke sutron kii ore se yah bhi kaha gaya ki airfrem kii sanrachana is tarah se kii jaayegi ki isamen baari ingine lagaaye ja saken, jisamen teen-chaar saal tak kaa samay lagane kii ummid he
 However, the initial batches of Tejas aircraft will be powered by low-power General Electric F404 engines, which generate 80–85 kilonutons of strength

 Some of the features of the "LCA version of the naval": tejas ekal ingine va vividh bhoomikaaon vaala jet ladaaku vimaan he, jisaki visheshtaayen hai poonchhrahit hona or yogic delta wing platform vaala or yah "relaxd statics stability"sanrachana vaala he, jisase vimaan kaa yudhkaushal badhaane main madad milti he
 It was originally intended to serve as a ground-attack attack aircraft as a mid-level "silent bomb" to prove air superiority, but due to the flexibility in structural considerations it would allow air to surface and navigation
 - Anti-weapon form can be integrated, allowing it to gain multiple roles and the ability to complete a variety of missions
 poonchhrahit or yogic delta planfarm kii sanrachana tejas ko chota or halkaa rakhane ke liye hai
 The use of this planform keeps control surface requirements to a minimum, allowing a wider range of external store to be carried and characterized by better close combat, higher speeds, and higher alpha roles than the cruciform structure
 vyapak paimaane par scale model par wing tunnel pareekshan model or jatil computesnal taral gatiki vishleshan se elsie kaa arodynemic vinyas kam se kam hua he, jisase ise nunatam supersonic draig, lo wing loding or role or pich kii ucch dar hasil ho sakaa he

 The airframe of the Tejas' naval version will be modified with respect to nose tilt to further improve visualization when landing the aircraft, and to increase speed during flight and use wing leading edge vortex controllers
 levcons operate on control surfaces that extend from the wing root leading edge and thus the LCA can be operated optimally during slow speeds, otherwise the theda is obstructed due to increased stretch, as in delta wing structures it happens
 ek atirikt laabh yah hota he ki LEVCON bhi hamale ke ucch kone par niyantrit karne kii kshamta badhaata he
 The backside of the Naval Tejas is also strong, with a tall and strong wheel and nose wheel steering for maneuverability on the deck
